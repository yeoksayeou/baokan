<p>（南京）外部對驅逐辛博森出境致英使藍博森之照會已辦就、即請英使將其驅逐出境、據外交方面息、英方對此决不至置諸不問、至辛博森繼任津海關稅務司、係奉亂命、當然無效、（二十日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）外部照會英·美·法·日·巴西·丹麥·挪威·芬蘭·意大利·古巴·土耳其·瑞典·荷蘭·比利時·西班牙·等國公使代辦、宣布國府處置閻逆强制接收津海關辦法、俾國際間對閻逆叛國眞相、得資明瞭、（二十日專電）</p>
<p>（天津）今日上午津稅務司貝泐發出通告如下、「奉總稅務司訓令、即日停閉津關、以待後命、河泊司仍照常辦公」、津關中外職員現皆贊助貝泐、今晨皆未到關、辛博森雖作開除之恫嚇、衆不之顧（二十日路透電）</p>

<p>（天津）天津稅務司貝泐氏率全體天津海關辦事人員、停止執行職務、足使山西當局受一大打擊、而此次事件發生之際、外國領事團不問海關辦事人員之意見如何、祇知向辛博森警告令勿阻害中外通商關係、且未得有預防不測之有効保障、僅處於袖手旁觀之地位、因此現在非常狼狽、正在協議應急之措置、海關之停頓、使中外商人受重大之損失、故對於領事團此次之措置、均大不滿意云、</p>
<p>對於如何應付海關閉鎖問題、此間領事館會議之結果决議暫派各租界巡捕、檢查出口進口貨物、以最簡單之手續辦理報關事項、以期勿停滯各國商人之貨物、所交納之稅銀、暫時由領事團保管、將來再交付中國合法的機關、外船之出入、不能因海關之閉鎖而杜絶交通、故常由領事團之手辦理各種手續、使得自由出入、海關重開、現在毫無希望、中國當局對於此事、擬如何辦理、外交團方面對於此事取如何之態度、皆爲一般人士所注目、</p>
<p>關於天津海關閉銷問題、日本領事館當局者首先詰問中國當局、中國當局立即表示道歉之意、旋又訽問中國方面對於此事、究將行應急對策否、中國方面答稱、並無一定辦法、擬將一切之措置、一任有關係諸國領事、因此日本當局乃與英國方面協議後、即召集各輪船公司之負責者、討論辦法、討論之結果、遂决定如别項所載之應急對策、務使一般商人及出入船隻之業務、不至於停頓、</p>

<p>（北平）日英兩國公使館接得天津海關閉鎖之報告後、視爲關係重大之事件、立即協議對策、其餘各國公使館、各將此事報告本國政府並請訓示（二十日日聯社電）</p>
<p>（南京）國府發表閉鎖天津海關、日本上村領事解釋之曰、於交戰狀態之下、閉鎖稅關、乃不得已、然若斷然封鎖天津港、則爲關係各國在天津外僑一萬五千之死活問題、惟中央聲明之中、能期其最有效者、即經過政府勢力管轄下之口岸而迴航天津時、先在經過之口、徵收天津行之貨物稅、但旣到天津、不納稅金、不能了事、其時非繳二重之稅不可、由外國直行天津時、雖不致發生此問題、然若於其間有舞弊行爲、則將來此船入政府方面之口時、勢必禁其出口云、（二十日電通社電）</p>

<p>依今日而論。素稱富之各國。財政問題尚有未至爲難之時者。而失業問題。則已同感其困苦。至商業如今日之每况愈下。失業之人必亦日增而日甚。政府旣救濟乏術。而所謂財政之困難。亦必依此而及。誠以今日商業之衰落。乃因工業發達過甚後。自然之趨勢。非一朝一夕所致。故亦非一國一方法所能補救。故各國政當以此爲政爭之具則可。若欲眞求其解决。恐無一政黨有此能力也。</p>

<p>前因後果</p>
<p>關於封閉天津海關、宋財政部長、經國民新聞社記者叩詢意見、發表談話如下、以一外國冒險倖進之徒、藉助强暴、竟敢强據海關、并敢明對奉公守法之華籍關員、以槍决爲威嚇之具、當地海關、自難執行職務、在此情形之下、國民政府對於天津海關、祇有令其暫時封閉、就現情觀之、可證此項辦法、旣屬必要之圖、亦爲健全之舉、近頃北方軍閥代表朱鶴翔、對路透訪員宣稱、原來值百抽五之舊稅、當照常匯解、以便應付外債、此外附加稅項、自應由閻將軍支配、至内債方面、大多數係用附稅擔保、而朱君則謂、此項債務、如不照付、應純由宋君負責、政府旣令津關封閉之後、乃僞稅務司事後追維、忽謂内國債務、應與外國債務、同等照付、換言之、即内國債權人之利益、在彼輩胸襟中、突與外國債權人受同等之關懷、但就其破壞海關制度之行爲、一加評斷、可知所稱顧全債權人利益、徒虚語耳、政府對於强據津關一事、正在竭力設法糾正、因此項行爲、除政治關係不計外、實動摇中國國家信用之基礎、至爲劇烈、此舉不但對於以關稅爲擔保之内外債、予以打擊、且政府迭次聲明、欲予整理之落後内外債、今年本擬召集債權人會商辦法、兹亦因此而受打擊矣、</p>

<p>減少赴津船貨</p>
<p>帶征津關稅北方强制接收津海關後、上海方面、各重要公團、均表示反對、即江海關同人、亦發宣言、否認辛博森爲津稅司、而滬地洋商、亦深致不滿、財政局對於北方强收海關一案、已議定治標之策、命令上海江海關、於各商帮報運天津貨件、從昨日（二十號）起、除應征出口稅外、所有到達天津、再應繳納之進口半稅、命令由江海關實行帶征、昨日海關已發公告、並已開征、惟各商帮對於此事、認爲一最困難之事實、旣不許拒納、而慮到津時、如前年江海關例、再征進口稅銀、各出口商、對此已在討論中、</p>
<p>運津貨減少上海至天津一埠、本年出口貨、本爲最少、直至六月分、始略有疋頭裝去、但較去年營業、僅十之二三而已、滬上赴津船舶、洋商正班輪、共計英船六艘、日船七艘、中國祇有兩艘、昨日本埠北洋帮、恐去貨納二重稅、故已實行減少出口、暫爲試運至津、</p>
<p>臨時船停往滬上往津之臨時貨輪以英日船較多、近自强接津關事起、各輪公司以船舶付納噸稅、向例在滬繳納即可通行各地、兹聞津關亦開征船鈔、而且大多數在六月底滿期、七月份付稅者、昨聞各輪公司爲避船鈔起見、已令滿期之臨時貨船、停開天津、</p>

<p>四月初、在杭州舉行全國運動會時、即聞中央有以五十萬元之經費、就首都籌備下屆全國運動會之决議、未幾閻馮稱兵、背叛中央、軍事倥偬經濟竭蹶、當此多事之秋、全國運動會籌備事務、仍積極進行、足證中央建設之志堅、而提倡體育之心切、凡我體育同志、宜皆當竭盡心力、盡量供獻意見、以謀此事之臻至善、今籌備委員已發表、正副幹事已聘定籌備事務、千端萬緒、不久開始據管見所及、其最重要者、莫如運動建築蓋歡美先進國家、通都大城莫不有精美雄壯之運動場、與圖書館及其他公共建築物並駕齊驅、今首都運動場擇定靈谷寺旁、與中山陵近在咫尺顯有與中山陸毘美之意、而稱中央重大建築物也、其形式結構須合法精美、自不待言、鄙人雖非工程師、但對於運動建築、曾在國外有一度之考察、在實施方面、亦有一度之研究、本匹夫有責、當仁不讓之意願與籌備諸君一商榷之、</p>
<h3 id="c165">（一）建築經費 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>運動建築費、多則數百萬、少則數十萬下屆全國運動會預算共五十萬、盡數作爲建築經費、尚屬不敷、故一切招待費用宜省至最小之數、按上屆全國運動會招待費不過三萬餘元、則下屆運動會五六萬已足、其餘四十多萬悉作建築費可也、</p>
<h3 id="c166">（二）運動場之地位 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>運動塲之地點、擇交通便利民衆易到之處建築、則日常應用便利、享受便多、若專爲開全國運動會而設、不顧平日應用之便利者則塲之效用甚微、建築雖精美、徒然也、今下届之運動會場已擇定中山陵東靈谷寺旁取其地域之寛大、風景之秀美、及他日城市建築計劃之顧及、固亦有相當之理由然離城太遠、在交通便利之城市爲家具汽車之民衆則可、爲交通不便之南京、日趨貧苦之中華民國之人民則不可、况今内戰復起、建設停止城内之空地猶多、財政困難、建費浩繁城外之建築無期、及人民徙居城外之日運動場早已崩壞、此亦不能不退一步慮及者也、、雖然運動場地址、早已决定、無可挽回、游泳池所何嘗不可擇城内相當之地、如勵志社及公共體育場附近建築及運動會過後、可購劵入池、可開市民新式消遣之風、萬一經濟不敷可在造林場辦公室後開設一露天游泳池、利用紫金山下之泉作池水、如是則自動換水、可免平日換水經費、如美國Ｍissorri省ＩronClale之露天游泳池、其好例也、一年前、作者曾率童子軍露宿於此泉之旁、早具此見界、開鑾之費、至多一萬元、望當局注意、</p>

<p>場地須分主附兩種在主場上須能舉行田徑運動足球排球籃球、及其他重要之項目、其周圍須建看臺、效日本神宫外菀之運動場一面建看臺三面築草坡、節省經濟在靈谷寺能利用山麓、則更經濟、看臺至少可容十萬入、因球隊太多主場之外、更可建籃球足球排球網球等附場、位主場之旁、如經濟不敷、不必建有看臺、下届全國運動會塲、宜用全部財力經營主場、不可再踏杭州運動場之覆轍在附場上亦建看臺也、</p>
<h3 id="c168">（四）建築之實際問題 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>甲、跑道之形式有正常式或籃曲式（Ｋorbogenform）及變通式（包括半圓式尖圓式）兩類、德國體育專門學校之運動場荷蘭阿姆斯脫屯運動場、均用正常式、取其跑道中問、得建一合法之足球場也、今春參觀杭州運動場之建築跑道之内、砂坑跳道、任意布置、毫無章法致足球場地位、完全占據、凡重要之足球比賽、不得在此主塲内比賽、至最後數日此場、已杳無人跡、殊損大會之精神、</p>
<p>乙·跑道本身之建築跑道本身之建築、非簡單事也、普通分三層、上層質料、方子最多、主要由細白煤灰屑粘土、及砂數種混合而成、决非單純細煤灰屑所能濟事、前屆全國運動會跳遠成績至多六·○五米即跳遠跑道建築不合法之過也、此次首都建築新運動塲或即爲第十一次之遠東運動會塲、亦即爲將來之世界運動會塲、中外觀瞻所繫、籌備當局宜三注意焉、</p>
<p>丙·跳道及推擲區域之布置跳道及推擲區城、大忌在足球塲之内、致破壞足球場、杭州全國運動會塲竟犯此病、德國對於運動建築法最精、以跳高跳遠沙坑及跑道、均分配於徑賽跑道曲叚之内、足球塲之外、「南」北、風光不順、可以捨此就彼、日本神宫外菀運動、塲中之跳擲區域之分配、即仿德國而來望籌備當局注意焉、</p>

<p>氣象事業。爲重要科學之一。歐美各國。罔不極力提倡。當局者不惜鉅資。經營締造。山巓海濱。以及通商大埠。都有氣象台。測候所之設立。招致專家。殫精竭慮。恒兀兀以窮年。工力旣大。成效乃著。故凡發現星辰。觀測天時。報章常見此項新問題之紀載。其影響於農工商業者。厥功甚偉。我國百業落後。即此氣象一端。早已主權旁落。國内著名天文機關。其不假手於人者。究有幾何。言之可歎。自中央研究院創設氣象天文兩研究所以還。國人於是稍稍注意。但在草創時期。人材尚尠。亟謀擴充。固屬重要。而人材之培植。尤爲當務之急。不觀夫東北西北邊陲要隘。外人正野心勃勃。爲越俎代庖之謀乎。友人黃厦千君。精研氣象之學。早歲隨竺可楨博士襄贊氣象研究所職務。現在清華大學講授氣象氣候等學程。兼籌備大規模之氣象台。近與記者談及我國領空問題之危機。頗足警惕。爰申述以告讀者。</p>
<p>其言曰。氣象事業。在我國似漸有發展之趨勢。久不注意之領空問題。或漸引入國人之腦際。不可謂非年來一好現象。惟我國氣象事業。根底大薄。美國本部面積與我相埓。國内大小氣象台及測候所達三千一百七十餘所。常年經費達二百餘萬金元。（約合我國八百餘萬元）日本氣象事業發達之程度。以面積論。殊不亞於歐美。民國八年在神户添設一海洋氣象台。建設費四十萬元。其中二十三萬元係出航業界捐助。其國民對於氣象事業之認識。亦殊可風。近年又在東京附近之館野。添設高空氣象台。以爲研究航空之用。建設費十萬元。規模亦殊不小。我國現時之氣象事業。不但不能與美國日本比。以面積論。在世界各國中尚不能與任何一小國比。因我國政府之不知辦理。一任外人之越俎代謀。法敎士之設徐家匯觀象台。旣早且著矣。海關測候所四十七處。主持者亦多屬外人。日本旣視滿洲爲其經營區域。因於大連·旅順·營口·遼寗·長春·五處。各設一氣象台。而未見國人有若何之表示。最近瑞典人斯文赫定譯音）在新疆藉考古之名。私設氣象台四處。（婼羗·迪化·哈密·庫車）觀測數年。紀錄已得。今已郵寄德國。供將來航空之依據矣。是皆近年來我國史用料中可堪注意之事也。</p>
<p>綜此以觀。外人謀我之心。灼然可見。國人若再自相殘殺。執迷不悟者。吾實抱無限隱憂而無以自解也。</p>

<p>楊君謂此次東京遠東運動大會。中國方面失敗。雖由日本裁判員之欠公。我方運動員缺乏協同動作之訓練。實則中國敎育於體育方面太不注意。有人建議敎部。小學亦一律設置運動塲。雖限於目前經濟力量未能實現。但在可能範圍内須切實進行。以養成一般國民注意體育之風習。日本小學極重體育。彼邦夙以崇尚武士道爲其國魂。即所謂大和魂。小學生亦以鬥劍爲戲。劍爲竹製或木製。相對剌擊。努目挺胸。宛然一武士也。</p>
<p>日人好武。自殺亦雄。或爲經濟。或爲情愛。或爲倫理。自殺之事。屢見報紙。其死也或自切腹。或枕車軌。或投高崖。間亦蹈海。鮮有投繯或服麻醉劑而死者。前時芥川龍之介自殺。自述因感著朦朧的不安而出此。不願使人難看。故服安眼藥水。日人或謂藝術家不怕生得醜。不可不死得美以譏之。蓋日本民族殘忍成性。自殺亦以慘酷之法行之也。</p>

<p>西報以下諸說不過謂美人不能盡明梅氏之劇。因發爲五里霧之詞。夫智力不齊。安能强同。美人不獲深解者。立論如斯。而獲解者如楊斯篤等ＳtorkYoung疊有二十餘文。載之紐約世界等報。於梅氏表演精微之處。摘發無遺。頃已付譯。不日當以專刋奉敎。一讀之後。當知解人不少。夫梅氏此行。必欲全美之黃童白叟。鼓舞軒　。其勢有所不可。而左右當亦未必以此遽爲苛繩者也。雄婦人之說。在國人重男輕女藐視伶　官者觀之。自非溢美之詞。然但論字面。則張良如婦人女子。謝覽芳蘭竟體均無輕薄之意。况左右奪精西學。必知外國報紙。好立詭詞以聳觀聽。如稱法國前克里滿沙氏爲虎。至繪爲諷剌之聳。亦燕頷而虎頭者。正出一理。若必謂梅氏所飾爲旦角而詘之。則不特中國爲然。歐洲戲劇。由弁而釵。曩亦恒有之事。降至今兹。流風未沫。梅氏在美。尚一遇師旦角者。相視目逆無足怪也。奚其貴焉。偶象一語。尊注頗當。梅氏誠不足爲中國人所崇拜。然竊爲現代中國人思想集中之說。則崇拜者應爲政治上之名流耶。生者禍國於無日。死者謬說相流傳。應爲軍事上之名將耶則勇於内戰。而怯於國難。應爲學術上之名家耶。則持舊者惟務剿襲。崇新者徒事負販。平心思之。梅氏以一技成名。十年篤學、猶覺此賢乎彼。左右平旦持躬。歷數現代之人物而　其遺行。當不以余言爲河漢矣。至代表東方藝術一語。梅氏未嘗自居。即有侈張之詞亦出他人之口。非梅氏所負之責。尊引美聯社電。亦稱劇術。於此何獨云然。昔謂代表中國人所崇拜之人物。則梅氏固未曾夢擬。而中國人果能盡去榮利之思。不顚倒於金錢勢力之下。不依違於盲從立異之途。以徒事寄托於文藝戲劇。陶養其心志。已復佳事。崇拜二字。本非專指功名領袖之人。况與原文。尚不相吻合。則所謂硬要閉着眼。及豈不寃哉二語。顧何所取義。國内聞此消息。毁舉紛如。本來宇宙無絶對從同之論。而左右所證引者。當爲無聊者之臆說。及聊以塞責之短評。夫以左右曾預報業之人。乃以快心歛財之工具。臨渴掘井之標題。據爲典要。以明其爲輿論。不亦大可傎夫。天津大公報。其評論夙爲國人所推崇。嘗著論以奬梅氏之成功。原文俱。在人文圖書館。當有輯存。可供省覽。則知輿論亦有不盡偏於尊指者焉。</p>
<p>海。民國四年。留日學生因日本提出二十一條件外交問題全體歸國。民國七年。留日學生因軍事協定問題全體歸國。並在上海創辦救國日報。民國十七年。濟南慘案發生。留學生多數回國。日本敎育界學者政治家常怪留日中國學生何以從事反日運動。較一般中國民衆爲尤激烈。不知留日學生滯留彼國。耳聞目見。剌激最深故其反日也亦愈烈。必然之勢也。</p>
<p>留學生固以日本爲最多。其次則爲美國。其原因自有多種關係。有人謂留日學生之所以多。有路近。文同。時短。費省。與國内政局不安種種關係。前敎育部則謂留美學生之所以多。因於入美國學校甚易。且可以國内學年資格隨班聽講。不及二三年而取得畢業資格回國者甚多。所以自費生趨之若鶩。民國八年。德國馬克跌價。留德學生日多。九年留法勤工儉學生與赴德學生均千餘人。十二年德國社會生活漸復狀。學生日少。赴法國者亦少。又日本留學生當前速成科時代。曾至一萬餘人之多。近來則漸漸减至三千四五百人。凡此種種。皆可窺見我國留學生在各國消長之原因也。</p>

<p>那末雖然是空等了許多時間。還算是失之東隅。收之桑榆。侍者們也忙忙地開始他們的序幕。熱手巾咧。檸檬茶咧。撮着他們的笑臉來寒暄敷衍咧。忙亂了一陣子。阿金是「閑話多於飯泡粥。」蕊雲却只是微笑不語。只見伊今天穿了一件新上身的湖色繡許多墨燕的素緞夾衫。梳了一個時式的髮髻。當頭還揷了一朶仙人掌上的紅花。臉上粉敷得雪白。胭脂紅暈到從臉上直到眼皮上。今日的嬌麗。宛同初春之花。却總是不絶地的微微笑着。左詩晨暗暗地想道。好了。所謂「心之金扉。」已經微微可以窺見了。看了伊的笑容。知道伊的心中。並没有什麽不快之感。瞧了伊的暈紅的臉面。深紅的嘴唇。知道是在預備做新嫁娘了。他本坐在一張略帶長方形的大菜桌横頭。阿金坐在右首。蕊雲坐在左首。他端相了伊一下。說今天打扮得格外漂亮了。蕊雲不說什麽。却只是笑。阿金道。這件衣料。是程大人送的。大阿姨是再也不肯做這種衣服咧。詩晨道。那一個程大人。蕊雲道。你也認得的。就是開水門汀公司的那個程老頭子。他的姨太太。還是我們小姊妹咧。左詩晨點點頭。又道。今天爲什麽梳了頭咧。蕊雲道。快點。肚裏餓煞哉。替我點菜吧。左詩晨笑着。覺得雖然所答非所問。但是自已所問的。也没多大的理由。高興梳頭就梳頭。高興打辮子就打辮子。他們的嚷着餓。倒是實事。從六點鐘出了堂唱。一經在外面跑。不曾回去過。當然要肚子餓了。世人往往以空談而忘實事。梳頭不梳頭是空談。而肚子餓却是實事。因隨手取了一張菜單。問道。那末你吃什麽。說出來。我給你寫。蕊雲道。你說我是梳頭好看呢。還是打辮子好看。左詩晨笑道。剛纔我問你爲什麽梳頭。你不答我。只嚷肚裏餓。現在敎你點菜了。又問我梳頭和打辮子的問題了。蕊雲道。你且說說看。左詩晨道。都好看。難看的人。打了辮了難看。梳了頭更加難看。標緻的人。打了辮子好看。梳了頭尤其好看。蕊雲撅起了嘴唇道。你就是這個樣子。問問你。一句不肯說實話。左詩晨發急道。咦。這不是實話嗎。阿金說道。不是的。這是大阿姨說的。阿囡時常打辮子。以後到了人家公館裏去。不能再打辮子了。所以先梳頭梳梳慣。頭髮也軟熟一些。</p>

<p>學校快到放學時問了、我們又隨處可以聽到一片讀書難的聲浪、我們又隨處可以看到、一般有心無力的求學青年、在嘆息着、在憂慮着、下學期的學費尚無着落、因此、也就會看到不知其數的失學青年、逼得他們不得不走了徧路、不得不埋殁了天才、不得不抛棄了他的正當的路途、這是都麽可痛心的事情喲、而在事實上、黨國元勲都在高喊着、青年是國家的精華、青年是國家的原氣、政府應當盡力匡意養成青年良好的品學、來鞏固黨國的基礎、這是都麽動聽的語調、這是如何應當的事體、但爲什麽又有不知其數的失學青年呢、這是青年自甘墜落嗎、還是政府没有努力注意青年的求學問題、惜我没有得到確實證明的報告、我不敢把我的臆斷就認爲是對的、所以我也祇好處於懷疑狀態之中、</p>
<p>但是、學校重地、窮人莫入、那巍巍學府的大門上、無形中都似乎釘着這兩塊森嚴可怕的虎頭牌、呌我們窮小子見之、不得不徒喚奈何、私立學校可以用不着講起、即就是最著名的、由政府費巨量的經費所創立而維持的中央大學、假使要到那兒去唸書的話、仍舊是每人每年至少非自有二三百元的添補、也就不行、這呌家境不充裕的青年們能享受嗎、政府雖則也算是煞費苦心、創辦了幾隻免費的學校、如上海勞働大學等、但這幾隻免費的學校、能收受全部有心無力的求學青年嗎、事實上仍舊是能聽到遍地嘆息着讀書難的聲浪、隨處能看到有心無力的求學青年們在憂慮着、下學期的學費仍無着落、</p>
<p>我們都曉得、失學青年的衆多、是社會現象的不幸狀態、但在産業落後的我國、所以有這種社會病態的表現、也可算是事實上所難免的事情、這固然也是整個的社會問題、可是、至少在我個人認爲失學問題的急需救濟、似乎要比其他病態較爲重要些、似乎這是一個治本的要圖、青年是國家的精華、青年是國家的原氣、而且天才不一定都是富家的子弟、所以我們要救國家、我們就不得不來做治本的工作、來灌漑國家的精華、來培養國家的原氣、盡量地供天才發展、即就應當盡量地救濟失學青年、使有心無力的求學青年、達到有心即可求學的地步、</p>
<p>惜我没有把本問題的各方面詳加探討、詳加分析、所以也不能貢獻出一個詳密的救濟計劃、不過、我看到失學青年的衆多、我就發出了這篇的呼喊、想能從我這呼喊、引起了一般人的同情、注意到本問題、討論出根本善妥的救濟方法、我更希望政府盡量地增高敎育費、使國立省立的學校能對貧民免費、在私立學校亦應加以經濟上的扶助、俾得減輕學費、給青年「有心即可求學」的可能、這就是我們的希望、也即就是我們的要求、</p>

<h3 id="c203">美國黑人的前途 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>美國黑人、歷史上備受白人壓迫、及至林肯解放黑奴、始獲得形式上之自由、然南部各州、其對黑人之歧視、仍極顯著、殘虐之事、時有所聞、直至近數年來、因黑人自身的奮鬥、情形始漸趨進步、倫敦觀象報近載一美國阿拉巴瑪州（按該州在美國南部黑人敎育事業最發達之區）通信、記載脫斯甘奇城之脫斯甘奇大學校長著名黑人敎育家毛頓博士、在黑人歷史紀念週中所發表之談話、詳述黑人在美國各處之近况及其將來、頗多可注意之點、兹節譯大要如次、</p>
<p>在美國黑人之前途、雖有許多困難及不幸、但以大體言、則極可樂觀、雖謂在歷史上從未有如今日一般之有希望也可、美國黑人、尤其在南方、雖尚多被歧待、或被剥奪公民選舉資格者、然此大半皆因黑人自已漠視其權利、未可完全歸咎當局、即南方各州白人、亦多有此種自已放棄其權利之傾向也、</p>
<p>至於黑人敎育、敎費之由各方捐助者、今日實已較任何往日爲多、須知南方各州直至最近始信敎育之應普及、蓋數十年前、即白人貧苦子弟、亦皆無享受敎育之權利、黑人更無論矣、現在黑人學校逐漸增多、受敎育黑人數更突飛猛進、畢業以後、多能從事各項專門職業、不落白人之後、大别言之、北方多醫士律師科學家文學家及藝術家、而南方則多商人、現在全國黑人商人聯會、會員日多、會務益進、余忝爲會長、結識眼光遠大智識超羣之輩頗多、黑人經營、以銀行保險及製造業爲多、即女子亦頗多幹才、如華格夫人、即爲佛及尼州里去蒙城一大銀行之行長也、</p>
<p>黑人對於農作、亦頗肯研究進步、已故張伯理斯君即其一例、張君故後遺囑將其大部分財産在脫斯甘奇造一學校及一幼稚園、敎育本城許多有色子弟、其爲同種人造福、實非淺鮮、</p>
<p>合作運動、在黑人中漸有勢力、此亦大可樂觀者、現在各地都有黑人商店聯合會、以互助精神、減輕單獨的負担、並改善貨物的質地以招徠更廣之營業、黑人之開店者、待客多以和善見著、新南方各省白人商店、亦多聘請黑人爲經理者、</p>
<p>有人過慮黑人人數增加智識開通後、黑白人種間求職業之競爭將加烈、或致釀成重大衝突、余以爲在高等階級中、不致有此危險、惟下等階級如勞工之類、則或將不免因求工作而致衝突、然亦不致十分重大、可以無慮、</p>
<p>白人虐待黑人事件、年來逐漸减少、據脫斯甘奇調查報告、此種事件、一九二九年僅有十起、較一九二八年减一起、較一九二五年則少七起、事件發生後、白人輿論對之亦大注意、不若往昔之不關痛癢矣、</p>
<p>黑人之爲牧師者、年來漸見其少、現在約計每五百三十四黑人中有一傳道師、而白人則約九百八十三人中佔一人、然入敎會者則頗少、在學校中求神學學士學位者亦見減少、然黑人在感情上雖較前趨沈、而在思想上則大爲精進云、</p>
<h3 id="c204">民衆藝展的印象霖 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>藝術應該民衆化、生活應該藝術化、這是很流行的兩句話、也是大家希望他能夠實現的一件事、用民衆的力量去提倡藝術、藝術必能站於永久、拿藝術的精神去變化生活、生活不致偏於枯燥、近來大多數人感覺到生活的不安、尤其是都市裏的民衆、處處顯出苦悶的象徵、事業的破落、品性的敗壞、尚在其次、欲求生活改善、民氣發揚、提倡高尚美術、和發展羣衆藝化、當然是一個切要的救濟辦法、我們對於這破天荒的上海特别市民衆藝術展覽會、作如是的解識、</p>
<p>在上海這個大都市裏、要找一個地方、最普遍而民衆化的、城隍廟實在是數一數二的了、從保障海隅的扁額起、裏面包羅萬有、每天有整千累百、男女老幼、朝拜這個聖域、本來豫園的風景、湖心亭、九曲橋、萃秀堂、玉玲瓏等處、景色固然不惡、又加了茶樓、古玩舖、鳥店、舊書灘……種種點綴、愈見得特殊氣味的濃厚了、這初次舉行的民衆藝展、地點揀在邑廟内園、大概是相得益彰罷、</p>
<p>民衆藝展開幕的一天、淅淅瀝瀝、雨下個不了、掛在大廳和走廊裏的字畫對條、冷清清地、在微風中顫動着、軸桿輕輕地敲在墻壁上、發出清脆而單調的聲音、參觀的人在字和畫中間、負着手走來走去、好像兩旁邊站着的儘是許多身長骨立供手相向的書畫家、下雨天、在這隂沉靜默的、廳堂廻廊裏、看意境淡遠的中國字畫、所得的印象、似乎很蕭條罷、</p>
<p>第二天、參觀的人增加約有兩倍、總數在一千八百左右、滿園子裏、頓時顯得很熱閙、從大門進去、先要簽字、因爲大家爭先恐後、加上些凌亂的現象、走進甬道、兩壁就看見有許多國畫、有些人帶了包裹零物、未進大廳之前、先要向寄物處寄存、只才灑着袖子、登堂看畫、中堂·立軸·屏條·尺頁、四壁琳琅、造成一個超凡的境界、有幾個年老的觀衆很仔細地、從這一幅看到那幅、不時用手捋着鬍鬚、將頭上下點動着、口裏也不時的微吟、至於一般的觀衆、不過放慢了脚步、從大廳穿過廻廊、再拾級登高、走上假山去了、會塲裏有許多小孩子、好像花間的蝴蝶、穿東到西、又快樂又嘻笑、</p>
<p>書法對聯之類、陳列在晴雪堂、眞草隸篆、諸格皆備、參觀者對於這一部、興趣似乎减少了些、不但小孩們連眯都不去眯他、就是擺着長衫袖子的先生們、一進晴雪堂、面色就比較的沉靜嚴重、而脚步却加快了、所以在這一間裏、很不容易見到許多人站在一起、就是有人朝着壁上望、也不過像書上喻神童讀書、一目十行下罷了、看過了字、就登高到延清樓看洋畫和攝影、</p>
<p>未上延清樓、先要經過聳翠亭、裏面陳列許多攝影作品、東西果然很不差、可是擠着作壁上觀的不及馬路上照相館門前的多、洋畫一大半是油繪、精美的作品果然不少、幼稚和生硬的亦所不免、裸女油繪也很有幾幅、有幾個年輕的觀光者、大家手臂攀着頭頸、在一幅較巨的裸女前、徘徊了一下、莫名其妙的咭咕了一陣、便相引而去、洋畫陳列室、地位本不十分寛暢、而出品確很踴躍、墻壁上滿懸了鮮艶奪目的鏡框、排比得水泄不通、起初跑上延清樓一看、竟樣跑進了一家專配鏡框的五金店、欣賞的機會、似乎多給鏡框的地位佔去了、</p>
<p>内園在平時並不輕易開放、這一次因民衆展覽的機會、而得瞻仰名園的並不在少、若然能夠永久關放、也未始不是一件有利民衆的事、不過下面的一節、似乎不能輕視、</p>
<p>一位辦事員向管園的老先生說、「那假山旁的一株白石榴樹、很是珍奇罕有、倒要注意、不呌小孩子攀折纔好」老先生已經是上了年紀的人、聽罷此話、微微一嘆、却是很興奮底說道、「所以不能開放、一公開不知要怎樣的遭蹋哩、」老先生說罷無言、沉着頭、狂抽他的旱烟管、似乎十天的會期、很是長久、</p>

<p>第四十三章學藝復興期以後的意大文學</p>
<p>以詩而言、新紀元的先驅、十八世紀的眞摯的意大利劇文學中最重要的人物、是屬於第一流的劇底力和眞摯的文體的所有者阿爾飛亞里、他的主材大半是古典、是希腦的傳說及古代的歷史、然而那文體、雖然有些憑藉於馬基雅弗利、却是新鮮雄勁的阿爾飛亞里自身的東西、有至大的影響及於意大利文學的、阿爾飛亞里的劇從未越過國境而進到英吉利文學裏來、然而他作爲劇作家·詩人·及散文作家是重要的、謳歌亞美利加獨立的他的頌詩我們是應當知道的、（他是熱烈的自由讚美者而暴君的敵）、以我所知、這未曾被譯爲英語、</p>
<p>十八世紀的最壯麗的意大利的作者是帕里泥他的「日」（ＩlGiorno）是犀利的諷剌、憑了那英勇的無韻詩的新鮮的使用、帕里泥相當地獲得了雷奥帕第冠於較自已年長的詩人的「近代意大利的味吉爾」這一個稱號、帕里泥縱有對於古典底過去的那種愛、却是獨立的·獨創底的人物、較不獨創底而更加屈從底、但也有優秀的才能的人物是夢提、他的重要大部分是由於他說明着文學對於實際底問題的關係這一個事實、他寫過讚美拿坡侖而有些阿諛的詩、然而他在文學上要求高的地位的權利却在易利亞德的翻譯、這是究極底的被公認的意大利譯、</p>
<p>和烏哥·福斯科羅一同、我們在時代上又在精神上入於十九世紀、在新世紀産生的二年前刋行「雅各奥底斯、」使他成爲意大利的哥德一流、雖然較之那偉大的德意志人、在範圍是狹得遠了、在奥大利和她的共謀者拿破侖的兩重桎梏之下的意大利的苦惱、由這書反映着、人也許以爲幾乎在歐羅巴的兩極端的那兩國意大利和英吉利的文學底關係、福司科羅是加以說明的最有興味的實例、論到這關係的大論文還有待於寫作、許多英吉利的詩人是居留於意大利、也死在意大利的、至少洛塞諦這一個優秀的英吉利詩人是屬於純意大利血統的、福司科羅在英吉利住過多年、乃是在英吉利批評壇被公認被尊敬的人物、他的　詩範圍雖狹却是優美的、他的「墓的詩」是凄美的抒情詩、他那對於英吉利文學家的直接的關係是在他所譯的斯滕的「感傷底旅行、」</p>
<p>這樣、我們就移到十九世紀最大的意大利的天才、算是悲哀·凄寂而且厭世的大詩人、但也是天生的歌人的雷奥帕第去、我們粗率地將他當作意大利的擺侖看、是可以的、他較之那意大利詩人、以雄勁和多産而言是差些、以細密和完成而言則勝些、他的魔力未曾移植爲英語、恐怕也不能移植的罷、英吉利的學者比刻斯忒司所著關於雷奥帕第的有趣味又有實益的書有一本、然而「以原作的音律」綴成的英吉利的詩却是離那意大利千英里之遥的、翻譯這東面、倘不是嚴密地依照文字的、則便是以翻譯者的言語重行創造的藝術、二者必居其一、然而即使爲了但丁及雷奥帕第來獲得足以讀書的意大利語的知識也未始不可、這是我敢以奉勸的、</p>
<p>小說上羅曼底精神由曼蘇尼代表得最好、再作一個散漫的無批判的、然而暗示底的比較罷、他是意大利的窩爾忒司各脫、他的小說「訂婚者」（ＩＰromessi）Sposi）是屬於第一流的小說、這進到歐羅巴的一切國語之中去、雖然不是意大利人似乎相信的傑作、這却至今還是津津有味的作品、在其中、有着一種有蠱惑力的柔美的東西、而且曼蘇尼費了多年苦心的那文體、當意大利的散文有飛揚爲虚浮的修辭的危險時、頗有力於維持牠在健全的基礎上、他是禀有種種的天才的人物、他的悲劇主要是因爲他所寫這緣故、所以現在出名而受人讚美、然而從傳統獨立、形式上是小說的他那最初的戲曲「卡爾馬格諾利耶伯爵」却也惹了那敏慧到常常發見美物的哲人哥德的眼、曼蘇尼是力的洋溢的光彩的抒情詩人、</p>

<p>當拿破侖死時他所作的詩一（ＩＣinqueMaggio）是使用意大利語的地方到處被知的、在這簡單的文學故事之中、至少、味第的優美的「鎭魂歌」是紀念曼蘇尼的東西這句話、是有記錄的價值的、尤其是倘我們努力要發見諸藝術的一致、人間的表現的連續性的話、</p>

<h3 id="e2">Tianjin Customs Officials Cease Work <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The National Government orders the Ministry of Finance to transfer them to other positions.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sends a note to the British Minister to expel H. O. Tong-Simpson from the country.</p>
<p>Customs duties will be collected by the Dalian and Qingdao Customs Houses.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Tianjin Customs House incident, it is reported that the 18th Central Political Council resolved on three measures: 1. Send a note to the British Minister to expel H. O. Tong-Simpson from China; 2. Close the Tianjin Customs House and transfer the Chinese and foreign customs officials; 3. Tianjin customs duties will be collected by the Dalian and Qingdao Customs Houses. The first item is being handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Regarding the second item, the Ministry of Finance has already instructed the Inspector General of Customs to inform them by telegram, but it is uncertain whether the customs officials can freely leave under duress. Regarding the third item, the Inspector General of Customs has instructed the Customs Commissioners of Dalian, Qingdao, and Andong to require ships transporting goods to Tianjin to prepay the full amount of taxes when passing through each customs house. The Jianghai Customs House has already issued a notice to this effect. According to some sources, H. O. Tong-Simpson has been in China for a long time and has close ties with the Northern warlords, acting as a tool for the warlords. He is now colluding with Yan Xishan to run an English-language newspaper for reactionary propaganda. The current forceful takeover of the Tianjin Customs House is generally believed to be H. O. Tong-Simpson's idea. However, the average monthly revenue of the Tianjin Customs House is only 700,000 to 800,000, and with the recent surge in gold prices and the reduction in imported goods, it is feared that this amount will be insufficient. No deductions can be made for the guaranteed foreign loans. The customs surplus and surtaxes seized are not impressive, only provoking the dissatisfaction of the diplomatic corps and earning a bad reputation for undermining the system. Regarding the attitude of the diplomatic corps, the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Finance have not received any news. However, the diplomatic community believes that since all countries have recognized China's tariff autonomy, they should trust the National Government's measures in this matter. (20th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has completed the note to the British Minister Lampson regarding the expulsion of H. O. Tong-Simpson and requested the British Minister to expel him from the country. According to diplomatic sources, the British side will certainly not ignore this. As for H. O. Tong-Simpson's succession as the Customs Commissioner of Tianjin, it is based on an illegal order and is naturally invalid. (20th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent notes to the ambassadors and representatives of Great Britain, the United States, France, Japan, Brazil, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Italy, Cuba, Turkey, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, and other countries, announcing the National Government's measures to deal with Yan Xishan's forceful takeover of the Tianjin Customs House, so that the international community can understand the truth of Yan Xishan's treason. (20th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) This morning, the Tianjin Customs Commissioner Belles issued the following notice: "Following the instructions of the Inspector General of Customs, the Tianjin Customs House will be closed immediately, pending further orders. The River Affairs Office will continue to operate as usual." All Chinese and foreign officials of the Tianjin Customs House now support Belles. None of them went to the Customs House this morning. Although H. O. Tong-Simpson threatened to dismiss them, they ignored him. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tianjin became a dead port today. There has been no development since the officials ceased work this morning. H. O. Tong-Simpson has telegraphed Yan Xishan about Belles' withdrawal of the officials and is now awaiting instructions to determine how to deal with the situation. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tax evaders in Tianjin kidnapped a tax inspector. (20th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The military and political authorities held a meeting at the residence of Customs Supervisor Ge Jingyou at noon on the 20th and decided to send someone to visit the British Consul James. It is claimed that China's tariffs have already been made autonomous, and the replacement of the Customs Commissioner is China's internal affair, and he has no right to interfere. The military and political authorities believe the issue is simple and have issued a joint announcement that business will resume on the 22nd. Meanwhile, they are recruiting personnel familiar with customs affairs and will appoint replacements for those who do not report for duty. If all the customs officials oppose H. O. Tong-Simpson, Yan Xishan will be asked to send someone else. Those who do not report for duty and secretly sabotage will be treated as reactionaries and severely punished. (20th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The cessation of duties by Tianjin Customs Commissioner Belles and all the Tianjin Customs personnel is a great blow to the Shanxi authorities. When this incident occurred, the foreign consular corps, regardless of the opinions of the customs personnel, only warned H. O. Tong-Simpson not to obstruct Sino-foreign trade relations, and without effective guarantees to prevent accidents, remained in a position of folded arms. As a result, they are now very embarrassed and are discussing emergency measures. The suspension of the Customs House is causing significant losses to Chinese and foreign merchants, and they are very dissatisfied with the consular corps' handling of the matter.</p>
<p>Regarding how to deal with the closure of the Customs House, the consular conference decided to temporarily send patrols from the various concessions to inspect export and import goods, handle customs declarations with the simplest procedures, in order to prevent stagnation of the goods of various countries. The taxes paid will be temporarily held by the consular corps and handed over to the legitimate Chinese authorities in the future. The entry and exit of foreign ships will not be prevented due to the closure of the Customs House, so various procedures are usually handled by the consular corps to allow free entry and exit. There is currently no hope for the reopening of the Customs House. How the Chinese authorities intend to handle this matter and what attitude the diplomatic corps will take are attracting the attention of the general public.</p>
<p>Regarding the closure of the Tianjin Customs House, the Japanese consulate authorities first questioned the Chinese authorities, who immediately expressed their apologies. Then they inquired whether the Chinese side would take emergency measures. The Chinese side replied that there was no definite plan and that all measures would be left to the consuls of the countries concerned. Therefore, the Japanese authorities, after consulting with the British side, summoned the responsible persons of various shipping companies to discuss the matter. As a result of the discussion, the emergency measures described elsewhere were decided upon, in order to ensure that the business of general merchants and incoming and outgoing ships would not be suspended.</p>
<p>The Tianjin Customs affairs are now decided to be temporarily handled by the consulate with the cooperation of various shipping companies. The tax rate will be the same as the old tax rate, and the tax money will be held by the consular corps and handed over to the legitimate Chinese authorities after its establishment. This is the so-called emergency measure.</p>
<p>The Japanese consulate here, at 2:00 PM on the 20th, performed the proxy customs affairs for the 400 boxes of honey carried by the Changjiang Maru, which arrived today. The goods were picked up by the consignees. (20th Japan United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The reasons for the Tianjin Customs officials' strike are as follows: 1. They received an order from the Inspector General of Customs to suspend their duties; 2. They opposed the tyranny of the new Customs Commissioner, H. O. Tong-Simpson; 3. They received encouraging words from the Shanghai Customs officials. (20th Japan United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After receiving the report of the closure of the Tianjin Customs House, the British and Japanese legations regarded it as a major event and immediately discussed countermeasures. The other legations reported the matter to their respective governments and requested instructions. (20th Japan United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the National Government's announcement of the closure of the Tianjin Customs House, the Japanese Consul Uemura explained that the closure of the Customs House is unavoidable in a state of war. However, if the port of Tianjin is completely blockaded, it would be a matter of life and death for the 15,000 foreigners in Tianjin. However, the most effective thing that can be expected from the central government's statement is that when returning to Tianjin through ports under the control of the government's forces, the tax on goods bound for Tianjin should first be collected at the port of transit. However, it is not possible to settle the matter without paying taxes once arriving in Tianjin. At that time, a double tax must be paid. This problem will not arise when traveling directly to Tianjin from abroad. However, if there are any fraudulent acts in the meantime, the ship will inevitably be prohibited from exporting when entering a port under the government's control in the future.

<h3 id="e3">The Focus of Political Strife Among Parties in Various Countries in the Future <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The difficulty faced by governments in various countries in the future lies in finances and unemployment. The opposition parties will also attack the government on these issues. However, even if the government falls due to these financial and unemployment problems, the most difficult thing for the opposition party after forming a cabinet will still be finances and unemployment. The political party after the fall of the cabinet will oppose the newly formed government, and the focus of their attack will still be finances and unemployment. Regardless of how many times the government falls and how many times it is formed, the issue of finances and unemployment remains the same. This is because the financial and unemployment problems of various countries in the future cannot be solved by the political parties of each country. All political parties believe that their party's policies can solve these two difficult problems, but in reality, they cannot. Therefore, when in power, they are attacked without being able to do anything. When out of power, they use this to attack others, and others can do nothing.</p>
<p>As of today, some countries that are known to be wealthy have not yet reached a difficult time in terms of financial problems, but they are already feeling the pain of unemployment. As commerce declines day by day, the number of unemployed people will inevitably increase day by day. Since the government has no means of relief, the so-called financial difficulties will inevitably follow. The decline of commerce today is a natural trend after excessive industrial development and is not caused overnight. Therefore, it cannot be remedied by one country or one method. Therefore, it is acceptable for political parties in various countries to use this as a tool for political strife, but if they truly want to find a solution, it is feared that no political party has this ability.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, on behalf of the National Government, issued a statement today regarding Yan Xishan's forceful takeover of the Tianjin Customs House, the general idea being that Yan Xishan sent H. O. Tong-Simpson to forcibly take over the Tianjin Customs House. Today, when tariffs are autonomous, it should be resolved by China itself and has nothing to do with other countries. The method of resolution is as follows: 1. The National Government will issue an order to abolish the Tianjin Customs House; 2. The old officials of the Tianjin Customs House will be transferred to other positions by the Ministry of Finance of the National Government; 3. In the future, the tax on goods exported and imported through the Tianjin Customs House will be collected by the Qingdao, Dalian, and Qinhuangdao Customs Houses; 4. The National Government will send warships to Dagukou to prohibit all merchant ships from entering and leaving the port of Tianjin; 5. Regarding the actions of the British H. O. Tong-Simpson, the National Government issued an instruction to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that H. O. Tong-Simpson's actions are in accordance with the provisions of international law, "When a foreigner in a country assists in a coup or rebellious act against that country, it may be claimed to expel the foreigner." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is specifically ordered to negotiate with Minister Lampson in accordance with this article to expel H. O. Tong-Simpson from China forever. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs formally notified all countries on the 19th regarding the abolition of the Tianjin Customs House; (20th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After receiving the report of the suspension of Tianjin Customs affairs, the ambassadors of various countries immediately requested instructions from their respective governments, depending on how the situation develops.

In this battle, more than 1,000 enemy soldiers were captured, more than 1,000 rifles, more than 10 machine guns, more than a dozen mortars, and two field guns.

"Today, disintegration and separation. If we continue to cling to the remnants and maintain the status quo, it will only increase the worries of the Party and the nation. I hope comrades will consider what the Premier proclaimed to us at the First National Congress, and strive to implement it together. The Second National Congress of the Party in Shanghai, advocated by Comrades Zou and Xie, is not entirely denied in its subjective aspects. However, objectively speaking, the Second National Congress inherited the First National Congress of the 13th year. The separation of the Communists in the 16th year was still decided by the Second Plenary Session. If we deny it now, the central hub of the Party will be interrupted, and what revolution can we speak of? If the Xishan comrades can avoid the current disputes and unite resolutely, it will demonstrate the magnanimity of the Xishan comrades." Words cannot fully express the meaning.

<p>(Hong Kong) The Chinese ship Xinlihe (transliteration), traveling between Guangzhou and Sihui, was contacted by a bandit leader last month, who demanded a protection fee of one thousand yuan. The owner ignored the demand and placed many guards on the ship for security. On Sunday, the ship sailed from Guangzhou. Among the passengers were three men dressed as military officers, leading six guards. At night, near Lanshi, the officers quietly drew their guns and drove the crew and guards to one corner, confiscating the guards' weapons. It turned out that the officers were actually disguised pirates. Soon after, a small boat belonging to the bandit gang arrived. Several people jumped onto the Xinlihe and began searching and looting. Three guards resisted the bandits and were shot dead on the spot. The bandits then loaded the stolen goods and cargo onto the small boat, kidnapped forty passengers, and fled with a shout. The Xinlihe later sailed to Sanxiao to report the incident. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>The New World Advocates, Australia and Canada Implement Later</p>
<p>Increasingly Promoting the Realization of the European Federation</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 20th - The new American tariff rates have aroused public anger in France. The House Tax Committee passed a resolution requesting negotiations with the United States to reduce tariff rates, otherwise, a retaliatory plan will be implemented. Former Prime Minister Herriot, in an audience today, strongly advocated that European countries should take unified action to deal with the United States. The Xiaoribao commented on the new American tariff rates, saying that a European Federation is now absolutely necessary and that those concerned about the current situation should pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Paris, 19th - Former French Prime Minister Herriot wrote an article in the evening paper, calling on Europe to unite and confront the new American tariffs, saying that if preparations are not made now for the future, it will inevitably lead to waiting for death, because Europe will no longer be able to supply goods to the United States, which will inevitably lead to industrial decline, national poverty, and increased unemployment. In addition, all newspapers have also done their best to attack the American tariff policy. For example, the Qiancheng Daily strongly advocated boycotting American goods and made slogans such as, "If America locks its ports to wait for our goods, we must lock our wallets to wait for their goods."</p>
<p>Reuters, Ottawa, 20th - After the American new tariff bill is approved, Canada's anti-American new tariff rates will naturally take effect, adding tariffs to 120 items, mostly agricultural products. According to statistics, Canada exports agricultural products to the United States annually totaling 30 million yuan. In addition, there are also timber, leather, livestock, and other items.</p>
<p>Reuters, Canberra, 20th - Australian Minister of Commerce Ford presented new tariff rates today, adding tariffs to 113 types of imported goods and reducing tariffs on 8 types of goods. These tariffs will be implemented immediately. Merchant ship taxes in Australian maritime operations have doubled compared to before. Rice, timber, and other items have all been taxed.</p>

<p>The Opposition Party Believes it Encourages War</p>
<p>Italian Newspapers Criticize France's Military Build-Up</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Paris, 19th - The rumor that the French government plans to ask Congress to add 100 million francs to national defense spending has shocked the opposition party. The Republican Daily, the organ of the Radical Party leader Daladier, expects this move to be met with significant opposition, saying that the actual leaders of the current government, Tardieu and Briand, want to leap into the rut of the arms race, and how contradictory their ideals and methods are. The two officials cannot be unaware that new military preparations are sufficient to encourage war and do no good to peace, which will turn Foreign Minister Briand's European Federation plan into a bubble. It is now heard that the Radical Party will coordinate with the Socialist Party in Congress to raise the issue of transferring 500 million francs.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Rome, 19th - Since the rumor of France's secret military build-up and the plan to add to national defense spending has spread, Italian newspapers have launched a massive attack. The foreign affairs interviewer of the Italian People's Daily, who is considered to be Mussolini's mouthpiece, wrote an article condemning France as a disturber of peace, saying that France continues to build up its military and that its generals of the army and navy often go to North Africa, Corsica, and the border between Italy and France to inspect various fortresses, and then rush back to Paris to discuss with the government how to increase their strength. These fortresses all make Italy feel threatened. Finally, the article compares France's military preparations with Italy's 棒喝党's (Fascist) policy, saying that the 棒喝党 uses the surplus of the national treasury to engage in peaceful work.</p>

<p>Military Arrogance Rampant</p>
<p>Government Unable to Control</p>
<p>Tension Rising</p>
<p>Revolution Imminent</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Helsinki, 19th - The Finnish political situation has suddenly become unusually serious. Retired soldiers are forcing the government to suspend the rights of the people conferred by the constitution, in order to eliminate the communist party's movement. The situation is expanding daily and has fallen outside of the government's control. Political circles all expect a 棒喝党 (Fascist) revolution to occur in early September. At the latest, it will inevitably break out by mid-September. The army seems to sympathize with the party. The guards organized under General Mannerheim also support this movement. The nature of this group is very similar to the Italian 棒喝党 militia. As for the Communist Party, it won 130,000 votes in the last election, occupying 23 seats in the parliament, and is currently busy preparing for self-defense, starting with organizing the Red Workers' Self-Defense Corps. In short, both sides have entered a period of rising tension, and there is fear that there is no hope of peaceful reconciliation.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Moscow, 19th - Soviet Russian newspapers are showing great alarm at the development of the Finnish political situation, saying that the current Finnish government is afraid that it will be unable to resist the pressure of the 棒喝党, and it is expected that the resurgence of Finnish anti-Soviet sentiment and the restoration of the former crown prince of Romania to the throne have led to the rise of the power of the 棒喝党 in the country.</p>

<p>German Foreign Office Sends Personnel to Apologize</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 19th - The youths who smashed the windows of the Polish Consulate General here yesterday have now been identified as communist youths. They were demonstrating at the Consulate because the Polish court sentenced three communist prisoners accused of political propaganda to death. Today, the German Foreign Office has sent personnel to the Polish embassy to convey their apologies. Similar demonstrations are now taking place in Paris and Prague, and famous figures all over Europe, even those who are not communists, have jointly written to the Polish government, saying that its sentence is too heavy and advising against execution. The signatories include the famous German scientist Einstein and the writer Mons Thomson, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature last year.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 18th - Democratic newspapers expect that the German government will soon prohibit the reactionary national communist party's stormtroopers, just as it prohibited the communist Red Front Corps last year, because few people are obeying the current order prohibiting the wearing of the party's uniforms and badges, and many are violating it. Its stormtroopers still go out every night to provoke those with different political views. Last night, Kassel City encountered this kind of conflict again, resulting in eleven serious injuries.</p>

<p>American Dispatch to Britain Vague in Wording</p>
<p>Byrd Returns Home in Triumph, Old Matters Brought Up Again</p>
<p>New York, 19th (Associated Press) - Rear Admiral Byrd and his team, after a two-year expedition to the Antarctic, successfully flew over the South Pole and returned home in triumph. They arrived in New York today. His wife personally welcomed him on a tugboat. As Rear Admiral Byrd and his team disembarked from the tugboat and entered the harbor, all the ships in the harbor sounded their sirens in salute. After landing, they entered waiting cars, escorted by police front and rear, and slowly passed through the crowds towards City Hall. The public, having heard of the Admiral's arrival, gathered on the roadside, eager to catch a glimpse of his glory. Upon seeing the cars arrive, they erupted in cheers. Byrd then met with Mayor Walker at City Hall. Walker delivered a welcoming speech, and Byrd replied with thanks, all broadcast nationwide via radio. It is expected that Byrd will go to Washington within days to discuss the issue of American sovereignty over the Antarctic region with the authorities. According to reports, in November of last year, the British government sent a dispatch to the U.S. State Department, expressing deep concern about Byrd's expedition and requesting the State Department's attention to the seven regions of Antarctica, the sovereignty of which should belong to Britain. Subsequently, the State Department reviewed the maps and found that the land claimed by Britain actually occupied a large portion of the Antarctic continent. They drafted a reply rejecting Britain's request. Just as the reply was about to be sent, the ideal of Anglo-American naval understanding began to develop. The U.S. government felt that it was not appropriate at this time to cause ill feelings between the two countries over the issue of Antarctic sovereignty, so the reply was shelved. Later, Mr. Cotton, as Undersecretary of State, learned that the British government's dispatch on this matter had not yet been answered, so he ordered a dispatch to be prepared as a reply. The dispatch was vague, full of empty promises. According to experienced diplomats, Mr. Cotton is now trying to avoid immediate discussions with Britain on the issue of sovereignty, leaving the issue unresolved, so that the United States can raise its claim to sovereignty at any time.</p>

<p>London, 19th (Reuters) - The relationship between Britain and Tanganyika has not been clearly defined since the end of the European War when Britain was entrusted with the mandate over Tanganyika. The British government has recently discussed this matter, and today a white paper was published outlining its decisions as follows: The British government proposes appointing an official to govern the three regions of Kenya, Tanganyika, and Uganda. Regarding certain transfer projects in the three regions, a legislative council composed of an equal number of representatives from the three regions will assist in the administration. The official will always be the chairman of the council. The governors of the three regions all have the power to veto or propose any legislation, but it must be submitted to the British Colonial Secretary for approval. The above resolutions will be submitted to a joint committee of both houses for adjudication, and the committee will also propose necessary amendments to the constitutions of the three regions.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Situation of Zhang Guijun's Withdrawal from Changsha <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Zhang Gui and other troops, surrounded on five sides by the Central Army, prepared to abandon Changsha and concentrate in Liling, hoping to flee to Jiangxi and enter Fujian, as detailed in yesterday's report. It is now learned that Li Zongren did indeed leave the province at 12:00 PM on the 15th, fleeing to Zhuzhou and Liling. All the staff members also boarded trains on the afternoon of the 16th, transporting them to Liling. The Zhang Fakui and Yang Tenghui units on the front lines in Pingjiang and Yuezhou gradually retreated through Changsha and were transported by train to Liling, and had not completely withdrawn until the 17th. Before leaving, Li Zongren ordered the War Zone Political Affairs Committee to raise 200,000 yuan by the hour of You (5-7 PM) on the 16th, and sent Lü Mengxiong to the meeting to supervise the collection. Feng Tianzhu and others had no choice but to use Huai salt as collateral to borrow 50,000 yuan from the Provincial Bank. Beyond that, there was really no money to raise. Lü Mengxiong took the money to Liling that night. After Li Zongren left the province, the order in Changsha was originally the responsibility of Li Pinxian, Feng Tianzhu, and others to maintain. Before 4:00 PM on the 16th, it was initially still calm, and they actively extorted military supplies from the Chamber of Commerce and the Huai Merchants' Guild. After 4:00 PM, three more Central Army warships from downstream of Yuezhou arrived at Pinglang Palace on the Provincial River and opened fire on the Provincial Capital. At the same time, the 15th Division of He Jian's troops, the Wei Suzhong Brigade and the Hou Pengfei Regiment, had advanced from Ningxiang to Yingwanshi on the opposite side of the river from Changsha. Li Pinxian, Feng Tianzhu, and others, knowing that Changsha could no longer be defended, all fled to Liling on the evening of the 16th. When leaving, Li Pinxian and others wanted to take all the firearms from the Public Security Bureau, the Security Team, the Provincial Government Guard Team, and the Changsha County Militia. After the Changsha Chamber of Commerce learned of this, they went to Feng Tianzhu and others to plead that they not be taken away, and explained that the order in Changsha depended entirely on these guns to maintain it, otherwise bandits would take the opportunity to move and there would be no way to resist. Only after Feng and others agreed could they be preserved. The Chamber of Commerce then established a temporary security maintenance committee, and handed over the Security Team, the Guard Team, and the Militia Team to the committee to command and maintain order. At that time (early on the 17th), Tang Shengming's (Tang Shengzhi's fourth younger brother) troops were still outside Changsha City, deploying along the riverbank from the Big and Small West Gates to Xinya, blocking He Jian's troops from crossing the river to cover the retreat of the remnants of the Gui Army. However, Hou Pengfei's regiment of He's troops had found boats to cross the river, and the warships were firing on the provincial capital to assist He's troops. The sound of the artillery was deafening, and the people were terrified. The Changsha General Chamber of Commerce then specially appointed Zhou Anhan (President of Hunan Reformation Institute) and Wang Zhengshi (Magistrate of Changsha County) as representatives to first negotiate with Tang Shengming, requesting that Tang's troops retreat with the Gui Army and, in any case, not fight across the river, causing chaos in Changsha. Next, they requested Hou Pengfei, the commander of He's regiment, to wait until Tang's troops had retreated before crossing the river to avoid conflict. However, it was heard that Tang Shengming still wanted to resist stubbornly and refused to leave immediately. Therefore, as of the time of this foolish person's dispatch (1:00 PM), the two armies were still confronting each other across the river. However, the Central Army had continued to arrive one after another, and He Jian's troops would surely capture it by tonight or early tomorrow morning. As for the Gui Army's escape plan, there were two routes: (1) Flee from Liling and Youxian along the border between Hunan and Jiangxi to Guangdong; (2) Flee from eastern Hunan to southern Jiangxi and enter southern Fujian.

<p>New Public Security Measures Established in Xuzhou</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Battle news on the Longhai Railway has been extremely silent for several days. The sentries of the two armies have been relatively isolated, so there are only artillery battles on the railway line, and no troop clashes. The two wings have been more active. According to news from the front, the Central Right Wing Army fiercely attacked the left wing positions of Shi Yousan's army on the 13th. Shi's troops were defeated. Also, the Left Wing Army recently defeated the Right Wing Army of the enemy, capturing Duan Zhiliang, Brigade Commander of the 1st Division of the enemy Xie Huimin's forces, Deputy Brigade Commander Zheng Qingyuan, Battalion Commander Tie Hanying, and six other officers, all of whom were escorted to the guard brigade of the headquarters' mobile headquarters train.</p>
<p>Public security in Xuzhou is extremely calm. Cai Bingyan, who concurrently served as garrison commander, was ordered to go west to protect the road, and his garrison commander affairs were temporarily taken over by Hao Jiajun. Hao took office on the 17th and telegraphed Song to come to Xuzhou to take office. Director He Yaogui of the headquarters also convened a conversation meeting of military and political personnel at the headquarters at 1:00 PM on the 17th to discuss public security, and decided: (1) All personnel in the reserve office must wear badges. (2) The original officials in the reserve office and this office, as well as those coming from the front and rear, should be treated the same. (3) Hospital guards must cooperate with doctors to carry out their work. (4) Inspect the weapons of wounded soldiers and stipulate the time for wounded soldiers to go out. (5) If necessary, a curfew will be imposed at 12:00 PM. (6) In addition to inspections, troops stationed at the station must carry out inspections of wounded soldiers and are not allowed to board trains south at will. (7) Personnel returning from the front are not allowed to come to Xuzhou without a passport. (8) Organize a joint military and police inspection office to carry out inspections of hotels and pedestrians. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM and has been notified by military and political organs to be implemented separately.</p>
<p>The area around Xuzhou is also calm, but yesterday a gang of bandits was suddenly discovered in Jiaxiang Village south of the city and was immediately suppressed. Jiaxiang Village is more than 20 li south of the city. It is called Taishan, and the terrain is quite high. The residents are also rich. On the morning of the 17th, a large gang of bandits, about 100 or so, suddenly fled from the southwest, surrounded the village, and carried out looting. The nearby villagers reported to the police team of the Seventh District, asking them to quickly suppress the bandits, and also rushed to report to the city. Lu Rutong, the captain of the county police brigade, immediately led the cavalry and infantry out of the city in the afternoon. After arriving at the village, they encircled it from all sides. The bandits were unable to resist, so they kidnapped more than ten students from the village's elementary school and fled south. On the way, they passed Youfangji and were intercepted by the security regiment. The bandits then set fire to Youfangji. The county police team chased from behind, and the bandits were finally defeated and fled south in a panic. The county police team is currently searching for the remaining bandits. Captain Zhang has now returned to the city to report. According to him, the bandits have all fled out of the Xuzhou area. (18th)</p>

<p>Confession of the Assassin Feng Mingsheng</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Feng Mingsheng, the assassin of Lü Huanyan, has been interrogated by the General Headquarters and has already confessed without denial. The detailed interrogation is recorded as follows: After the suspect was arrested, he was first sent to the Public Security Bureau, where he was interrogated by Director Ouyang. The suspect cunningly refused to confess. Then, at 3:00 AM that night, Chairman Chen and Commander-in-Chief Chen took him to the headquarters, where the two Chens, together with Lü's Chief of Staff Wu Fan, personally interrogated him. He still refused to confess. The suspect even said that when he was guarding Chairman's room, he suddenly heard a gunshot and knew that someone was assassinating Chairman. At that time, he was afraid of being affected, so he abandoned his gun and fled, etc. Then, Zhan Bang, the manager of the New Asia Hotel, was summoned to the case to identify him. When the incident occurred, Zhan Bang saw the suspect committing the crime and fleeing after abandoning his gun. He immediately followed him downstairs to chase him. At first, on the stairs, the suspect was already embraced by Zhan Bang, and he shouted to catch him. Because the suspect was strong and powerful, he pushed Zhan Bang down, but Zhan Bang also desperately followed him downstairs, blowing his whistle and shouting for arrest. He then walked to Yihe Street, which is behind the Zhonghua Theater, and was caught by the police. According to Zhan Bang's testimony, it was vivid and clear. At this point, the suspect finally bowed his head and had nothing to say. Later, he directly admitted that he was instructed by Tan Qi, the adjutant of Bai Chongxi, three days ago, in Luoba Xu, Guangxi, that is, after the Battle of Beiliu, Tan Qi had lobbied him. Because he and Tan Qi were old colleagues, he was bewitched by him. At that time, he made it clear that after assassinating the Chairman, he would be given 10,000 yuan in cash and guaranteed to be a battalion commander or regimental commander. For a time, fame and fortune controlled his heart, so he agreed to him, but he would only act when he had the opportunity. Last month, on the front line, he tried to act several times, but he never had the opportunity to take advantage. Recently, Tan Qi heard that the Chairman was coming to Guangdong and thought there was an opportunity to take advantage of, so he urged him to proceed in Wuzhou and followed him to Guangzhou. He found out that he and the Chairman were both living in the hotel. Two days before yesterday (that is, on the 13th and 14th), he asked him to go to the Tai'an Inn on Changdi recently to take action, and threatened him, saying that if he did not assassinate the Chairman, he would definitely announce his conspiracy in the newspaper, and he would also be in trouble. Because he was threatened by him, he then made up his mind to go back to the hotel and assassinate the Chairman. Although Tan Qi said that after assassinating the Chairman, he would give him 10,000 silver, he had not used a penny beforehand. It was really not worth it, etc. The interrogator then asked the suspect, saying, "In addition to Tan Qi, who else has contacted you? Do you still have any intention of murdering others? Why did you come to Guangzhou to assassinate?" Feng replied, "The mastermind only told him to murder Chairman Lü individually. He didn't tell him to kill anyone else. I have been plotting for two or three months. I can kill him at any time and anywhere when I have the opportunity. I didn't intend to kill him in Guangzhou. However, on the night of the incident, I happened to be on duty as a guard. At that time, only the Chairman was eating in the room, and all the staff members were asleep, so I thought the opportunity had come, so I decided to kill him. In Guangzhou, in addition to Tan Qi, there was another person who contacted me. He was a Whampoa student. At first, I didn't know his surname. Later, I heard that this person's surname was Liang, and he was also from Guangxi, about 24 or 25 years old, with gold teeth. He had been to the Jinling Hotel and contacted him twice, urging him to act quickly so that he could be promoted and get rich, etc." After asking this question, the official said to the suspect, "You must speak truthfully and not implicate others. Are Tan and Liang still at the Tai'an Inn and the Jinling Hotel now? Can you take us to arrest them? That will definitely help you to be reborn." The suspect replied that he could find them, but he didn't know if the two of them had heard the news and fled. Therefore, the headquarters immediately sent military police to investigate and brought the suspect to the Tai'an Inn and the Jinling Hotel in a car and searched the area. The two men had already flown away. The suspect was then detained in the Public Security Bureau to await further investigation and arrest of the mastermind. Yesterday (the 15th), the Public Security Bureau also dispatched a large number of detectives to various places to investigate. As of the afternoon, there were still no clues. In addition, Director Ouyang, in order to clarify the case to the public, besides issuing the suspect's confession, that is, issuing it to the newspapers to clarify the truth after Ma Mingsheng was arrested in the Public Security Bureau, he also brought the suspect to the bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday to take a photo. When the photo was taken, this foolish person witnessed the scene. The suspect was wearing a gray military uniform, gray canvas military shoes, and black socks. His complexion did not change. After the photo was taken, he was still detained in the detention center. It was heard that the suspect initially confessed at the headquarters that he was from Hengzhou, and at the Public Security Bureau, he confessed that he was from Nanning, 20 years old, with a father and a younger brother, and unmarried. He admitted that he had followed Lü for more than three years, but he did not expect that he would be so ruthless because of greed. As for Lü's body, it is still at the Zhongda Hospital. Lü's mother and two concubines are all at the hospital, and their condition is extremely sad. Lü's mother is over sixty years old and has rarely been to Guangzhou. According to Lü's staff, Lü was very filial to his mother in his life. This time, when he went east, he initially asked his mother to come with him, but his mother was reluctant to come because she was old. Later, after Lü repeatedly urged her, she reluctantly came, but she did not expect to encounter this tragic event. After being assassinated, Lü's mother hugged the body and cried loudly, fainting several times. She is still crying day and night, forgetting to sleep and eat, and those who see it are all moved to tears. The headquarters has now sent the Deputy Adjutant's Office to cooperate with Wu Fan and the staff members to organize a funeral office, and the body will be put into the coffin at the hospital at 4:00 PM today (the 16th). (Evening of the 16th)</p>

<h3 id="e66">Regulations for Inspection of Imported and Exported Foodstuffs <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>In order to revise the regulations for inspection and registration of imported, exported, and transshipped foodstuffs, the National Government specially instructed the Executive Yuan, stating, "A letter from the Central Political Council was approved, stating that the Government Secretariat had previously forwarded the 'Regulations for Inspection and Registration of Imported, Exported, and Transshipped Grains' drafted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining to the Central Political Council for consolidated review. The original document was copied and sent for verification. After being reviewed by the Civil Food Committee, it was reported that the draft regulations were generally appropriate, but there were still some articles that needed to be added or subtracted. After careful consideration and modification, a revised draft was prepared and submitted for review. As for the requests originally submitted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining: (1) The inspection and registration of imported, exported, and transshipped grains should be handled by the Agricultural Products Inspection Institutes of the Ministry in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places, and entrusted to the municipal governments of Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, and Zhejiang provinces; (2) The Executive Yuan should order the Ministry of Finance to instruct the Inspectorate General of Customs to order all coastal customs offices that all imported, exported, and transshipped grains should be handled by customs officials who would notify the merchants to submit customs declarations, bills of lading, permits, and other relevant documents to the grain inspection and registration agencies for stamping, as a basis for assessment. These two points seem feasible, but since they involve implementation procedures, it is proposed that they still be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and compliance. The 231st meeting of this council resolved that the revised regulations should be approved and the rest should be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval on file. Accordingly, the 'Regulations for Inspection and Registration of Imported, Exported, and Transshipped Foodstuffs' approved by this council are enclosed, and it is hoped that they will be followed for implementation and a response will be made. A copy of the 'Regulations for Inspection and Registration of Imported, Exported, and Transshipped Foodstuffs' is attached. Accordingly, it should be implemented immediately. In addition to instructing the office to reply, a copy of the attachment is hereby made and issued to the said Yuan for compliance."</p>

<p>Preparations for Receiving Wounded Soldiers. The Medical Department of the General Headquarters has determined that Huishan Mountain in Wuxi is the location of the 22nd Rear Hospital. The arrangements have been completed. The county government has also received a telegram from the Ministry of Military Affairs ordering them to quickly prepare for supplies. However, due to years of famine in Wuxi, reduced silkworm harvests, and the depression of all industries, the local finances are extremely depleted. Yesterday, a telegram was specially sent to the provincial government requesting that various expenses such as the supply and reception of wounded soldiers be disbursed from the provincial funds and reported for reimbursement upon completion. Furthermore, as the wounded soldiers will be transported to Wuxi soon, leaders of various agencies and organizations were convened to discuss protection and consolation matters. It was decided to establish three groups: General Affairs, Protection, and Consolation. The county government's Finance Bureau and Construction Bureau will be responsible for General Affairs. The Wuxi Gendarmerie Regiment, Water Police District, Public Security Bureau, and Business Corps will be responsible for Protection. The County Party Headquarters, Chamber of Commerce, Education Bureau, and various mass organizations will be responsible for Consolation. After the decision was made, each group convened separate meetings to discuss the specific measures. In addition, the General Headquarters organized a Wounded Soldier Management Committee, assigning various committee members to manage the wounded soldiers and all educational matters in various rear hospitals.

<p>Organization of Grain Inspection Office. In recent days, the price of rice has soared in Wuxi, making it difficult for the common people to obtain food. The county government has repeatedly received telegrams from the Department of Civil Affairs ordering the rapid establishment of a grain inspection office to prohibit private hoarding. Yesterday, a grain inspection office was specially organized at Daxukou to strictly inspect outbound grain. Wu Zhengrong, captain of the police brigade and water patrol team, was appointed as the director of the inspection, and Wang Zongzhi was appointed as the inspector. It was established immediately to prevent smuggling.</p>
<p>Investigation of False Accusation of Seduction and Abortion. The Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau outside the South Gate of Wuxi submitted a case a few days ago involving Hua Meichang's seduction of three young girls: Lu Aidi, Zhou Jinzhu, and Ding Zhangdi. The case was transferred to the county government for handling by the Public Security Bureau. After interrogation by Investigator Zhou, it was learned that the case was instigated by Lu Runchun (also known as Lu Yunzhong) from the South Gate, who falsely accused Hua Meichang of seduction in an attempt to harm him. The police were immediately dispatched to arrest Lu and bring him to the county, and the members of the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau, Luo Xiaoda, were also summoned to the county for interrogation. Lu Runchun was evasive. In the second interrogation, Luo Xiaoda confessed, "I went to arrest the people based on Lu Runchun's report." Investigator Zhou said, "This case has been investigated clearly and is completely contrary to your report. You can still be forgiven if you tell the truth." However, Luo still refused to confess. After the interrogation, Lu Runchun was ordered to be detained, Luo Xiaoda was ordered to return, and Hua Meichang was released on bail. The three young girls were each taken back by their parents. It is heard that people in Nanli believe that the members of the Third Branch, Luo Xiaoda, were suppressing the facts and were particularly illegal. They will jointly submit a complaint to the Party and government authorities in the coming days, requesting that Bureau Member Luo be removed from office and punished.</p>
<p>Lu Jiumei Died from Abortion. Lu Jiumei (also known as Lu Ada), a 16-year-old maidservant in the home of Li Zhongchen, a resident outside the West Gate of Wuxi, had recently become acquainted with a certain Jia nearby, and became pregnant in secret. Jiumei went to the home of midwife A'erniang in front of Xiaomu Bridge for an abortion. Unexpectedly, the medicine was improperly used, and the fetus rotted in her abdomen. She was sent to Pu Ren Hospital for treatment, but the infection spread and she could not be saved. She died at about 1:00 AM on the morning of the day before yesterday. Her family reported the death to the county, requesting an autopsy. Yesterday afternoon, Investigator Yu went to conduct the autopsy and found that the deceased Lu Jiumei had indeed died from an incomplete abortion. After the autopsy, Yu instructed the deceased's mother, Lu Qian, to prepare a coffin and collect the body herself. Lu Qian had no money to buy a coffin, so Li Zhongchen provided the funds to purchase a coffin and collect the body.</p>

<p>Cooperative Trainees Assigned to Work in Various Counties. Cooperative business is a new emerging business in China. The general public, of course, does not know what it is. Even intellectuals and administrative officials often do not have a deep understanding of it. The central government issued a notice to the whole country, stipulating that the week starting from July 5th should be a cooperative movement promotion week. However, there is a lack of cooperative talent. Even if there are people who are enthusiastic about cooperative business, they are ultimately unable to reveal thorough theories and real benefits to awaken the public and achieve great results. Cooperative instructors have a considerable understanding and experience in cooperative theory and practice. Therefore, the Department of Agriculture specially dispatched cooperative graduates to various counties before July 5th to assist the Party and government in conducting large-scale propaganda and to make the public have a clear understanding so that they can automatically rise up and work hard in cooperative business.</p>
<p>Young Woman Saved from Drowning. At 8:00 AM yesterday, a young woman was about to drown herself at the ferry terminal on the riverbank. She was rescued by a police officer and survived.

<p>Bandit Ship Attempts Robbery in Shaobo. Kongjiaqiao, west of the county-owned Shaobo Town in Xiyi, was suddenly attacked by more than 100 bandits on the late night of the 17th. They were riding in many small boats and were anchored on the river surface. The watchman there noticed and reported it to the Shaobo Public Security Bureau, the Business Corps, and the Water Police Team overnight.

Unexpectedly, the bandits had already heard the news and fled.</p>
<p>Chen Asks for Relief. A young woman came to the Women's Relief Center in the county yesterday evening (18th), requesting relief. After the center inquired about her origins, it was said that the woman was Chen Guizhen, 16 years old. She originally lived in the Yangzhou Church Ground, but her parents died early and her brother did not engage in legitimate work. A neighbor named Wang, seeing that she had no one to rely on, took her to Shanghai to work in a silk yarn factory. Initially, the woman only pocketed her wages. Later, seeing that the girl had grown up and was beautiful, she wanted to sell her to a brothel. The girl was deeply afraid of being trapped, so she fled back to Yangzhou alone. Unexpectedly, she could not find a single person who was an old friend or relative. In desperation, she turned to the Relief Center. Director Bao of the center has already kept her for education.</p>

<p>Yongcheng Money Shop Grounded. Yongcheng Money Shop in the North Street of the city, opened in the spring of the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927), with a capital of 20,000 yuan. The manager was Shen Xiaokang from Shaoxing. However, the shop had little deposits. The loans it made were all withdrawn from Shanghai Ankang and other shops, and from various Jiangs in Suzhou. As a result, it made no progress. For three years, not only was there no official interest, but the expenses were still insufficient. At the end of last year, it was almost impossible to maintain. Fortunately, help from colleagues allowed it to survive the year. This year, the shop manager and Wang and others jointly opened a cocoon business. The cocoons they collected were mortgaged to Shanghai Ankang and Jiang, worth more than 200,000 yuan. When the accounts were settled, the shop owed Ankang more than 40,000 yuan in current accounts, which were all deducted. As a result, the shop's turnover was not working and it was grounded on the 15th. At that time, the manager, Shen Xiaokang, had returned to Shaoxing for business. Deputy Manager Xie Aitang telegraphed Shen to return to Huzhou. Shen rushed back the night before yesterday and was still thinking of ways to maintain it. However, the losses were too great and could not be recovered. It is heard that the manager and partners have 70,000 yuan in arrears, owe about 40,000 yuan to various shops in the city, 40,000 yuan to Shen shops, 80,000 yuan to various shops in Suzhou, and the total amount owed to depositors is no less than 200,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Chunhui Middle School Suspends Operations Due to Kidnapping Case: Zhang Yuwen, the head of general affairs at Chunhui Middle School in Yiting Baimahu, convened a meeting of the school board to discuss solutions after the school's principal, Fan Shoukang, teacher Wu Minxing, and student Xia Dingcai were kidnapped by bandits, resulting in no one to take responsibility for school affairs and students having no interest in studying. The meeting was held at the Jing residence in Baimahu at 2 PM on the 17th, with seven people including Jing Ziyuan in attendance. The results of the discussion were as follows: (1) The school will not pay ransom for the kidnapped Principal Fan Shoukang and others to prevent increasing banditry. The families of Fan and others must find their own way to rescue them. (2) Without effective security measures, no principal or teacher would dare to take the position and students, learning from the past, would sharply decrease for the next semester's school opening. Therefore, it was decided to temporarily suspend operations and submit the difficult-to-maintain reasons to the provincial government. If the provincial government has proper security measures for Baimahu, then the school will find a way to reopen. (3) The school closing date for this semester was originally July 1st, but now that people are anxious, the school will be dismissed early on the 19th. Each student, except for graduates, will be issued a transfer certificate.</p>

<p>Letter Received</p>
<h3 id="e81">Letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Police Headquarters <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Regarding the news item published in your newspaper on June 18th in the Jingjiang News column, "Provincial Police and Bandits in Fierce Battle," which stated that the defenses of Xilai Town were weak and that bandits intended to raid it. When Company Commander Wang Zhenwei learned of this, he immediately joined the Sixth Company to suppress the bandits at Yijiabao. Company Commander Wang set out at 6 AM on the 14th, but the Sixth Company failed to arrive due to unforeseen circumstances, resulting in insufficient government troops to fight the bandits. Company Commander Wang was hit by a bullet, soldiers were killed and wounded, and 21 firearms were lost. According to our investigation, all troops sent to various locations to engage in fierce battles with bandits are required to report the detailed situation to the headquarters afterward. However, we have not received any reports from the relevant unit regarding the events described in your newspaper. Considering the importance of suppression and the reputation of the military, we believe that your reporter's account is based on hearsay. Therefore, we have sent this letter to request a correction and kindly ask that it be published in the "Letters to the Editor" column.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Police Headquarters</p>

<p>Local News: Finance Minister Song</p>
<h3 id="e82">Discusses the Closure of the Tianjin Customs <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Regarding the closure of the Tianjin Customs, Finance Minister Song, upon being asked for his opinion by a reporter from the Guomin News Agency, made the following statement: "A foreign adventurer, relying on violence, has dared to forcibly occupy the customs and openly threaten law-abiding Chinese customs officials with execution. Under these circumstances, the local customs authorities cannot perform their duties. Therefore, the National Government had no choice but to order the temporary closure of the Tianjin Customs. Judging from the current situation, this measure is both necessary and sound. Recently, Zhu Hexiang, a representative of the Northern warlords, declared to a Reuters reporter that the old tax rate of 5% ad valorem would be remitted as usual to pay foreign debts. In addition, the surcharges should be controlled by General Yan. As for domestic debts, most of them are secured by surcharges, and Mr. Zhu said that if these debts are not paid, Mr. Song should be held responsible. After the government ordered the closure of the Tianjin Customs, the pseudo-Tax Commissioner belatedly claimed that domestic debts should be paid on the same terms as foreign debts. In other words, the interests of domestic creditors suddenly received the same attention as those of foreign creditors in their minds. However, judging from their actions in destroying the customs system, it is clear that their claim to protect the interests of creditors is merely empty talk. The government is making every effort to correct the forced occupation of the Tianjin Customs, as this act, apart from the political implications, fundamentally undermines China's national credit. This move not only strikes a blow to domestic and foreign debts secured by customs duties, but also thwarts the government's repeated statements that it intends to reorganize the backward domestic and foreign debts. This year, it was originally planned to convene a meeting of creditors to discuss solutions, but this has also been affected."</p>
<p>The Tianjin Customs Incident</p>
<h3 id="e83">Difficulties for Shipping Merchants <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Reduced Shipments to Tianjin</p>
<p>With the Tianjin Customs forcibly taken over by the North and Tianjin Customs duties collected, major public organizations in Shanghai have expressed their opposition. Even the staff of the Jianghai Customs have issued a declaration denying Xin Bosen as the Tianjin Customs Commissioner. Foreign merchants in Shanghai have also expressed strong dissatisfaction. The Finance Bureau has decided on a temporary solution to the Northern forced takeover of the Customs by ordering the Shanghai Jianghai Customs to collect the import half-tax that must be paid upon arrival in Tianjin, in addition to the export tax, for all shipments to Tianjin reported by various merchant guilds, starting yesterday (the 20th). The Customs has already issued a notice yesterday and started collecting the tax. However, the merchant guilds consider this to be a most difficult situation, as they are not allowed to refuse payment, but worry that when the goods arrive in Tianjin, they will be taxed again as in the Jianghai Customs example from previous years. Exporters are already discussing this issue.</p>
<p>Reduced Cargo to Tianjin: The amount of cargo exported from Shanghai to Tianjin this year has been minimal. Only in June did some textiles begin to be shipped, but this was only 20-30% of last year's business. Of the ships from Shanghai to Tianjin, foreign merchants' regular liners include six British ships and seven Japanese ships. There are only two Chinese ships. Yesterday, the Northern merchant guilds in Shanghai, fearing that they would have to pay double taxes on goods going to Tianjin, implemented a reduction in exports and temporarily tested shipments to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Temporary Ships Stop Going to Shanghai: Most of the temporary cargo ships going to Tianjin are British and Japanese. Recently, since the forced takeover of the Tianjin Customs, the shipping companies have found that the tonnage tax, which was usually paid in Shanghai and allowed ships to pass through all locations, is now also being collected in Tianjin. Moreover, most of these taxes are due at the end of June, with payment due in July. Yesterday, it was heard that in order to avoid the ship tax, the shipping companies have ordered the temporary cargo ships with expired taxes to stop sailing to Tianjin.</p>

The results were as follows: (1) One proposal from the coal industry regarding respecting the Law on Handling Labor Disputes and eliminating actions outside the scope of labor disputes was resolved to be submitted to the Congress. (2) Two proposals from the civilian shipping industry. (A) How to properly ensure protection when foreign ships damage Chinese ships in order to safeguard navigation rights was resolved to be submitted to the Congress. (B) Member resistance to paying monthly fees hinders the work of the association, and strict warnings should be given. The decision was made that the situation regarding the collection of monthly fees differs in each industry. It should be up to each industry to find its own way to reorganize and does not need to be submitted to the Congress. (3) Five proposals from the shoe industry. (A) What methods should be used to solicit industry members to join? (B) How to remedy difficulties in collecting membership fees? The decision was made that the above two proposals regarding membership fees and membership issues rely entirely on the sound development of chamber of commerce affairs, so that those who have not joined the chamber of commerce feel the benefits of joining the chamber of commerce, and difficulties will be readily resolved. It is neither enforceable by law nor can a proposal be created out of thin air, so it will not be effective, and there is no need to submit it to the Congress. (C) Urge the labor union to vacate the house. It was resolved that the Chamber of Commerce will send a letter to the Social Bureau to verify and there is no need to submit it to the Congress. (D) The illegal actions of the workers' union. The decision was made that the points mentioned are suitable for the degree of violating the police penalty law, so-called "inflicting violence on people, not to the point of injury," and should be handled from the administrative aspect. Both labor and management should respect the Law on Handling Labor Disputes, which has already been proposed by the coal industry. (E) The industry rules that have been approved for record should be followed by the industry. The decision was made to merge it with the same proposal from other associations and submit it to the Congress. (4) One proposal from the sausage industry. Non-member industry members should abide by the association's resolutions. The decision was made that the association's resolutions should not have a binding effect on industry members who are not members of the association. However, the nature of the industry rules approved by the competent authorities is different from the association's individual resolutions. Since they have been approved by the government, there should be no abuse of bias and monopoly. In order to protect the public interest of all industry members, non-member industry members have an obligation to comply, that is, to submit the original case to the Representatives' Congress after revision. (5) One proposal from the Western clothing industry. Transfer to Chinese weaving industry to improve weaving to be suitable for manufacturing Western clothing materials. The decision was made that the Chamber of Commerce should immediately transfer the letter to four industry associations: woolen fabric factories, electrical silk weaving factories, mercerized cotton weaving industry, and silk industry, without having to submit it to the Congress for discussion. The detailed method of promoting domestic products has been drafted by the association, and will be organized into a special committee after the City Chamber of Commerce is established to actively handle it. (6) One proposal from the department store industry and the pollen industry. The industry regulations approved by the association should be regarded as special regulations for the industry by the government, and non-member industry members should comply with them. The decision was made to submit the proposal from the sausage industry and the shoe industry to the Representatives' Congress. (7) One proposal from Wang Yansong, a representative of the silk industry, and Zheng Chengqing, a representative of the southern goods industry. Create a commercial school to train commercial talents. The decision was made to submit it to the Congress. (8) Two proposals from Luo Qinghua, a representative of the silk industry. (A) Industry association houses should not be arbitrarily occupied without the permission of the association.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>It was resolved to submit it to the Congress. (B) Should the workers' union exist? Please forward it to the central government for interpretation. The decision was made that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has clearly recognized that shop assistants are merchants in the interpretation of the Law on Handling Labor Disputes. The Union Law does not have the name of a workers' union. It should not exist legally. The Executive Yuan's instructions have been approved and the Ministry has informed the provincial and municipal governments. The original text has been published in various newspapers on the 18th of this month. The points mentioned in the proposal have been resolved and there is no need to submit it to the Congress for discussion. (9) Four proposals from the tea industry. (A) Association members should not be allowed to freely withdraw from the association, and they should not stop paying monthly donations. (B) At least one person from each industry shop must join the association. Non-members should have methods to be banned. The decision was made that restrictions on members joining and withdrawing from the association are inconsistent with the Ministry's interpretation of free duties and cannot be proposed for deliberation. (C) Industry members should abide by industry rules. (D) Industry members should abide by resolutions. Otherwise, a method of punishment should be stipulated. The decision was made to submit the proposal from the sausage department store industry and the pollen industry to the Congress. A total of 18 proposals were received from various associations.

<h3 id="e87">Disputes Over Police Power on Boundary Roads <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>A letter to the American Consul-General and Leading Consul, Mr. Cunningham. Yesterday, the Municipal Government sent a letter to the American Consul-General and Leading Consul regarding the police power on the boundary roads, stating: "We have received your letter and understand its contents. The Municipal Government has always believed that the Shanghai Municipal Council's various measures on the boundary roads are unfounded in law and unreasonable in principle. Regardless of whether the 1899 Yangjingbang Land Regulations, which the Shanghai Municipal Council uses as an excuse, have been formally approved by the Chinese government, even according to Article 2 of the regulations, it can only obtain the right to purchase land within the restricted area. As for the right of security, it is originally the supreme power of the state and cannot be usurped or assumed by others. Since the boundary roads are Chinese territory and the routes pass through areas within the scope of this city, then the exercise of police powers by the police of this city on the roads cannot be regarded as outside the law or irregular actions. In response to the previous letter, we hereby reply for your information."</p>

Therefore, a shareholders' meeting is scheduled for June 27th, 1930, to propose necessary resolutions so that shareholders authorize the company to accept the ITT's bid and transfer the company's operations to the new company. In this regard, the directors have revised the original terms of ITT's bid, making significant changes. The revised terms are listed below. This is a factual matter, and we urge you to pay attention:</p>
<p>(A) The capital invested by the new company in the business, as interpreted in the amended exclusive rights agreement, will have a net profit fixed at 8%.</p>
<p>(B) 2% of the capital invested in this business will be allocated annually to public bonds, up to a maximum of 20%.</p>
<p>(C) After the above two items have been deducted and allocated, any surplus should be divided equally between the new company and a revision of the fee pricing structure.</p>
<p>(D) Current user fees must not be increased until the telephone system is completely converted to an automatic system.</p>
<p>(E) Once the above conversion is completed, fees should be charged according to the prices proposed in Mr. An Sheng's report, in addition to the public contributions paid to the two Public Works Departments.</p>
<p>(F) After Mr. An Sheng's prices are implemented, they must not be increased for three years, but prices can be reduced.</p>
<p>(G) If, during the conversion to the automatic system and the implementation of Mr. An Sheng's prices, profits are insufficient, they cannot be recovered in subsequent years.</p>
<p>The directors earnestly recommend that the shareholders accept the ITT's bid, and we dare to state that in negotiating this matter, the directors and company executives have carefully considered and consistently taken into account the interests of both shareholders and users. The directors recommend accepting the bid and respectfully present the reasons for this recommendation, hoping that shareholders and users will carefully review them.</p>
<p>Esteemed Shareholders, regarding the issue of the old company's stock price, the board of directors has carefully considered it. The price ITT is willing to pay is either 75 taels of silver per share, or, at this rate, 1.5 shares of the new company's stock in exchange for one share of the old company's stock. Each shareholder is free to choose either option: whether to sell the old shares for cash at 50% above face value, or to continue participating in the new company's operations by exchanging one old share for 1.5 new shares. If shareholders accept the latter option, they can retain their interests in the new company, just as in the old company.</p>
<p>ITT has expressed its strong desire to have a larger number of people than currently enjoy the benefits of this business. The company's position, as an operator of public utilities, cannot regard the stock price as the sole criterion. A high price would require increasing capital, and the profits would need to be calculated based on the capital.</p>
<p>Esteemed Users, during negotiations with ITT, the directors and the company agreed that the price of fees must be maintained during the reorganization of the automatic system (for two years). After the reorganization, ITT has agreed to use the prices suggested by Mr. An Sheng as the basis for fees and has agreed not to increase these prices for three years. At the end of the three years, the issue of price increases should be handled according to the regulations on percentage profits.</p>
<p>The prices suggested by Mr. An Sheng are based on immediate implementation, while the above-mentioned method agreed upon by the directors and ITT ensures that the current low prices can continue for two years, and that the price increases proposed by Mr. An Sheng (which are still extremely low compared to other places in Shanghai) will be the maximum price for the following three years.</p>
<p>Finally, the directors wish to reiterate and request a review of the following points:</p>
<p>(1) ITT's bid is consistent with the company's previously announced strategy, and Mr. An Sheng also agrees with this strategy.</p>
<p>(2) The advisory committee recommended accepting ITT's bid, and the two Public Works Departments subsequently approved the bid.</p>
<p>(3) The bid allows for public service, ensuring rapid improvement and superior work, permanent maintenance, and constant addition of equipment to provide the public with a first-class telephone system.</p>
<p>(4) The company's development plans have been delayed for many months due to the need to examine other automatic telephone systems. Such delays have already caused significant losses. Further hesitation would have unthinkable consequences.</p>
<p>In view of the above points, we hope that the shareholders will support the directors' recommendation and vote in favor of the proposals at the meeting on the 27th. To ensure a sufficient quorum for the meeting and voting, we urge all shareholders who cannot attend to promptly fill out the attached proxy form and return it to the company by 4:00 PM on Wednesday, June 25th. This is our most earnest request.</p>
<p>With best wishes,</p>
<p>On behalf of the Board of Directors, Acting Chairman P. Bale, June 19th.</p>
<p>Another Notice to Shareholders:</p>
<p>This is to notify you that the Shanghai Hua Yang Telephone Company Limited will hold a special shareholders' meeting at 4:00 PM on Friday, June 27th, 1930, at the Royal Asiatic Society Hall, 5 Museum Road, to propose the following resolutions:</p>
<p>All the amendments to the ITT bid, as described in the letter from Mr. Keer, Vice President of ITT, to the Chairman of the Board of Directors of this company on April 15th, 1930, should be accepted, subject to any modifications deemed necessary by the directors of this company. Furthermore, the directors should be instructed to immediately transfer the company's operations to the new company mentioned in the letter and to sign and complete all necessary agreements and procedures to execute this matter. This is hereby proposed.</p>
<p>All of the company's transfer books and stock registration books will be closed from June 25th to June 27th, 1930 (inclusive). This is to notify all shareholders for their information.</p>
<p>By order of the Board of Directors, Secretary Lang Hexi Te, June 19th, 1930.</p>
<p>The Case of the Pharmaceutical Industry Placing Unemployed Workers</p>
<h3 id="e89">Finally Resolved Recently <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Introducing Fifty People for Employment in the Pharmaceutical Industry</p>
<p>Those Who Do Not Qualify Will Receive a One-Time Severance Payment</p>
<p>Revised Conditions to be Handled by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The case of placing unemployed workers in the pharmaceutical industry in this city has been resolved by the full committee of the Chamber of Commerce. Yu Qiaqing, Ye Huijun, Wang Yansong, Wang Xiaolai, and Wen Lanting were publicly elected as five committee members to represent the industry and petition the Central Party Headquarters in Beijing to withdraw the order. This was previously reported in the news. We now hear that this case has been resolved. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>After the representatives of the petition returned to Shanghai from Beijing, they received Order No. 9393 from the Central Executive Committee, which stated: "Received. The labor-capital dispute in the pharmaceutical industry in your city has been prolonged and unresolved, which is inappropriate. The association should be allowed to select and introduce 50 qualified unemployed workers from the 128 eligible workers to the capital side for immediate employment. Regarding the elimination of the substitute worker system, many of the 13 articles previously agreed upon by the labor and capital sides of the pharmaceutical industry are inappropriate and also conflict with the Trade Union Law. After this case is resolved, the association should investigate and study it, and then submit it to the municipal party and government organs for proper revision to resolve the dispute. In addition to instructing the Shanghai Municipal Party Department and Municipal Government to investigate and handle it, you should also inform them of this order."</p>
<p>Employing Fifty Unemployed Workers. After receiving the Central Order, the association reported it to the Standing Committee for discussion and decided to comply. At the same time, it notified the National Pharmaceutical Industry Union to comply. The Municipal Government and Municipal Party Department also received the Central Order and instructions on how to handle it. The Chamber of Commerce then sent a letter to the Civic Training Association, requesting that the names, native places, and resumes of the unemployed workers be sent to the association for review and introduction. Subsequently, the association received a list copied by the Civic Training Association, totaling 128 people. After excluding those who already had jobs and those who had been expelled from the association for various reasons, there were actually 101 people. The 54th and 55th Standing Committee meetings of the Chamber of Commerce then decided to introduce 50 people from the list and issued a list to the National Pharmaceutical Industry Association to distribute to various stores for employment. The list of 50 people is disclosed below: 1. Mi Weixian, 2. Xu Dingtai, 3. Yu Xiaxian, 4. Guo Yuankang, 5. Wang Yongsheng, 6. Du Jiabin, 7. Li Meihua, 8. Wei Xiqi, 9. Hu Lianfang, 10. Dong Rusheng, 11. Zhang Jinbao, 12. Shi Shanxiao, 13. Zhang Huaqing, 14. Yang Guobin, 15. Zhu Dongchen, 16. Yu Tianzhu, 17. Yu Bangheng, 18. Zhang Zhenhui, 19. Gao Bingsheng, 20. Chen Yunbao, 21. Fei Fugeng, 22. Nie Jichang, 23. Sun Yunxia, 24. Zheng Xizhou, 25. Shen Jinsheng, 26. Fang Fusheng, 27. Gu Jinfa, 28. Qiu Wangzhou, 29. Liu Songjun, 30. Wang Xiangjun, 31. Yang Liansheng, 32. Feng Yongyuan, 33. Sun Kaiyuan, 34. Zhao Xinan, 35. Yang Xuewei, 36. Chen Shanzhang, 37. Lv Nansheng, 38. Zhou Yaseng, 39. Wu Liangquan, 40. Fang Lusheng, 41. Zhu Bingjiang, 42. Zhu Yuanlin, 43. Gao Meiqing, 44. Gu Meixuan, 45. Wang Yongcai, 46. Chen Jinzhang, 47. Bian Zucheng, 48. Shi Chunhui, 49. Li Huaifang, 50. Xia Qinsheng.</p>
<p>Those Who Do Not Qualify Receive Severance Pay. For the 51 workers who were previously reviewed and found unqualified by the party and government organs (in addition to the 128 people), according to the decision of the central and municipal party and government organs, each person was given 20 yuan for travel expenses to return to their hometown, totaling 1,020 yuan for 51 people. Yesterday, the Chamber of Commerce sent the full amount to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for distribution.</p>
<p>Revised Conditions Transferred to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Regarding the pharmaceutical industry employee treatment conditions that conflict with the Chamber of Commerce Law and the Trade Union Law, according to the Central Order, the Chamber of Commerce should review and discuss revisions, and simultaneously resolve the substitute worker system and the apprentice promotion system. Because the Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to convene a city-wide representative conference today to prepare for the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, it is not possible to handle it in time. The 55th Standing Committee meeting decided to transfer it to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to continue to comply with the Central Order.</p>
<p>Reporting the Handling Process to the Central Government. The Chamber of Commerce reported to the Central Government yesterday on the handling of this case in compliance with the order, and the transfer of the revised conditions to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for record-keeping.</p>

(5) All the miscellaneous services during the association's office period were handled by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee. Now that it is over, should we give them a small reward? It was decided to allocate five yuan. (6) How should the association's revenue and expenditure be announced? It was decided: 1. Post it in the newspaper. 2. Distribute it to various unions by mimeograph. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<p>Local News: Picking Up Shell Casings</p>
<h3 id="e91">Tragic Incident of Shell Casings Exploding and Injuring Many People <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Zhenqian Discarded Shell Casings</p>
<p>Scavengers Gathered to Collect Them</p>
<p>Unexpended Powder Remained in the Shell Casings</p>
<p>A Loud Explosion Led to a Major Disaster</p>
<p>Zhou Zhenqian, a Shandong native, has been running the Sanhe Yong Waste Copper Tin Shop at Liu's Tomb Alley in Qinglian Street, Nine Mu Di, Nanshi. He specializes in collecting various types of copper and tin, melting them down, and then re-manufacturing various utensils. A few days ago, he suddenly bought more than 80 kilograms of discarded shell casings. When he bought them, Zhou thought the shell casings were made of copper. Unexpectedly, when he attracted them with a magnet, more than 50 kilograms of them were made of copper-clad iron. If copper and iron are melted in the same furnace, the pure copper will be useless. Therefore, Zhou was extremely frustrated afterward and threw more than 50 kilograms of iron casings into the trash can next to Xiong Changfa's wooden shop in Qinglian Street. Unexpectedly, many nearby scavengers saw Zhou throw out so many shell casings and thought they were valuable. They jointly pulled them out of the trash can and gathered on the side of the road to collect them. Unexpectedly, some of the shell casings still had unexpended powder. Due to excessive knocking, they suddenly exploded with a loud bang, alarming the surrounding area. As a result, seven people's faces were injured and they fell to the ground. Fortunately, nearby police officers heard the noise and rushed to the scene. They immediately reported the incident to the First Precinct of the Second District. Upon hearing the news, Chief Qian immediately led several senior police officers to the scene for a detailed inspection. He first inquired about the names of the seven injured people: Wang Youfa, 38 years old, from Zhenjiang, resident of No. 46 Qinglian Street, sustained injuries to three areas: face, chest, and legs; Tang Xilin, 33 years old, from Shaoxing (address unknown); Wang Simin, 22 years old, from Ningbo, resident outside Xiaobeimen; Lu Adu, local, 24 years old, resident of No. 14 Jiu Mu Di; and pedestrian Yan Dengshan, 44 years old, from Shandong, injured face. The above five people sustained face injuries, but were not seriously injured. Lu Awei, 30 years old, from Ningbo, resident of No. 40 Qinglian Street, sustained injuries to three areas: face, chest, and legs. His condition was the most serious and his life may be in danger. After the investigation, Chief Qian ordered several senior police officers to send the seven injured people to Renji Hospital. Because the hospital's wards were insufficient, four people were sent to Shanghai Hospital. He also took Shen Shiyou (23 years old, from Shandong), a partner of Sanhe Yong Copper Tin Shop, to the police station for questioning. He will submit a report along with the more than 50 kilograms of discarded shell casings to the Judicial Section for review.</p>

<p>Both Women are Pregnant</p>
<p>They Can Only Be Allowed to Get Married</p>
<p>Mei Xiaoyun. Mei Yunfu, a resident of No. 37 Sanyi Road, Wusong, is over 50 years old and still worried about having no son. He married a wife surnamed Li, who gave birth to a daughter named Xiaoyun, who is 18 years old and has a passable appearance. Last spring, through an introduction from a neighbor, she entered the spinning department of the Huafeng Yarn Factory in Yunzao Port, Wusong. Within a few months, she was seduced by Zou Zhichen, a staff member of the same department. Xiaoyun's love bud opened, and seeing Zou's youthful charm, she was completely captured by him. The two had already made mountains and sea oaths and agreed to stay together until they turned grey. Later, Zou thought that their relationship would not last long without a formal union, so he asked someone to mediate with Xiaoyun's father. Unexpectedly, many good things were frustrated, and he was severely rejected by Mei Yunfu. Xiaoyun knew her father's persistence, so she eloped with Zou like Hongfu and built another love nest. Within a few months, she was already pregnant. Her father found out. Because his beloved daughter had already made it a fait accompli, and publicizing it would affect his reputation, he automatically asked someone to mediate with Zou yesterday, willing to recognize him as his son-in-law and hold a wedding ceremony to make them a family.</p>
<p>Zhao Yinbao. Zhao Jiang, a local woman residing at Gaomu Bridge, east end of Lujia Du, Pudong, is 50 years old and has a daughter named Yinbao, who is 19 years old and not yet married. She works in the box-packing room of the Rongchang Match Factory in Lujia Du. Shi Xiaoqing, a 26-year-old worker from Qingjiang in the same factory, who had not yet married, had a love affair with Yinbao. They often secretly met and made a secret agreement to grow old together. Her mother did not know about it. Unexpectedly, on March 1st of this year, Yinbao suddenly disappeared. After many days, she had not returned home. Jiang was panicked and sent people to inquire everywhere. Until the afternoon of the 17th, she found out that she had been abducted by Shi. Jiang was furious and took Shi to the Third District Public Security Bureau, ordering him to hand over Yinbao. According to Shi Xiaoqing's confession, he admitted that he was in love with Yinbao. At the same time, Yinbao also confessed that she was willing to marry Shi. Even if Shi became a beggar in the future, she was willing to beg with him. They were both sent to the local court for disposal. The court, considering that the case involved the abduction of a young girl, instructed Jiang to file a separate lawsuit. Therefore, both parties left the court together at the time. However, Yinbao's relationship with Shi started last year, so she is now five or six months pregnant. Jiang thought it was a fait accompli and did not want to be involved in litigation. After mediation by a third party, it has been peacefully resolved. Yinbao has officially become Shi's wife, and the lovers have become a family.</p>

<p>The porters at various stations on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway are supposed to charge eight copper coins per piece for carrying passengers' luggage. However, the porters have recently been disobeying the regulations and extorting at will, even demanding as much as one small ocean (silver dollar) per piece. Passengers are suffering from this. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau, in view of this, and in order to protect the interests of passengers, has issued a special order to station inspectors. If any porter dares to extort in violation of the regulations, they should report it to the Traffic Department for severe punishment.</p>

<p>The Shanghai South Public Bus Route 3 originally ran between Laoximen and Gaochangmiao. Later, due to poor business, it was changed to run on Zhonghua Road. Later, in order to facilitate passengers traveling north, it continued to run on Minguo Road, forming a Route 3 loop line. The section of the route belonging to the urban area was opened to traffic on November 6, 1929. The section in the French Concession, because it belongs to the business scope of the French Tram and Electric Light Company, must first be discussed and agreed upon with the French company. The Shanghai South Public Bus Company has already negotiated a contract with the French company and submitted it to the Public Utilities Bureau for transfer to the Municipal Government for approval. It is expected that it will be put into operation soon.</p>

<p>With Four Suicide Notes</p>
<p>Zhou Tingyi, a 23-year-old from Wuxi, worked as a waiter at the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road. He took leave to return to his hometown on the 10th of this month. He returned to Shanghai a week later and spent the night at the Sanjiang Hostel on Beihai Road on the evening of the 18th, arriving at midnight. The next morning, the room service attendant knocked on Zhou's room, No. 30, but there was no response. Suspecting something was wrong, he opened the door and saw the guest lying stiffly on the bed. He was rushed to the hospital. After examination, it was found that he had taken opium. When trying to resuscitate him, he had lost his mind and refused to take medicine. He soon died. Afterward, four suicide notes were found in the hostel, addressed to his grandmother and mother-in-law. Reading between the lines, it seemed that he was in debt and could not make up for the losses, and he resorted to this desperate measure. There was still residual pain in the words. The deceased married last winter. His wife's name was Yueqin. There were no children.</p>

<p>Clothes and Jewelry Vanished</p>
<p>Husband Files for Divorce</p>
<p>Chen Deyi, the twenty-five-year-old owner of a rice shop in Yangsi Township, Pudong, lost his wife, Cai, to illness in 1925. Subsequently, through the matchmaking of Li Amao and a Mr. Zhou, he remarried a Miss Gong from Sanlin Township, the daughter of Gong Yutang. They were married on the third day of the second month of the fifteenth year of the Republic. Unexpectedly, after Miss Gong entered the household, she frequently used excuses to return to her parents' home, staying for several days before returning. Chen often went to his in-laws' home to pick her up, only to find she had disappeared, causing him considerable suspicion. On the tenth day of the first month of the lunar calendar last year, Miss Gong again used an excuse to return to her parents' home and never came back, despite repeated attempts to contact her. Chen then checked his wife's clothing and jewelry, only to find they had all vanished. He went to his in-laws' home to question them, but Miss Gong refused to see him. Unable to endure this any longer, Chen retained lawyer Qu Yue to file a petition for divorce with the local court. The case was heard in the seventh courtroom by Judge Zhang Jinjian on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 2 p.m. The plaintiff, along with his lawyer and witnesses, appeared in court. The defendant, Chen Gong, did not appear. After the judge took his seat, the plaintiff, Chen Deyi, recounted the previous events, stating that the clothes of his deceased wife, Cai, in the chest had all been damaged by the defendant, Chen Gong, who had broken the chest's hinges and taken away more than twelve items of clothing. (Question) When were you married? (Answer) The third day of the second month of the fifteenth year of the Republic. (Question) Was your marriage good? (Answer) Initially, it was harmonious, but in June of that year, according to local custom, the new bride had to return to her mother's home for a summer rest. She returned home as usual, for about a week. The plaintiff went to pick her up, but the defendant was not at home. According to his mother-in-law, she had gone to Shanghai. The plaintiff had no choice but to return disappointed. Two days later, the defendant was sent back by her father, Gong Yutang. (Question) What does Gong Yutang do for a living? (Answer) Gong is a clerk at Hengfeng Rice Shop at Wanyu Wharf. At the time, I asked my father-in-law what the defendant was doing in Shanghai. My father-in-law said he did not know. My father-in-law then scolded the defendant, but the defendant was very unrestrained and showed irregular behavior. The plaintiff has unspeakable reasons, and so on. Next, the witness Cai Changsheng testified, age fifty-three, local resident, living in Bailianjing. Chen Deyi is my son-in-law. My daughter died of illness on the twenty-ninth day of the fifth month of the fourteenth year of the Republic. The following year, my son-in-law remarried Miss Gong. (Question) Was their marriage good? (Answer) Initially, it was good, but later, because Miss Gong had improper behavior, it was no longer good. In November of the year before last (1928), one day, just before dawn, Miss Gong suddenly came to my house. I knew that Miss Gong did not live at her mother's home, because my son-in-law had told me the day before. At the time, I asked her to eat breakfast. After breakfast, I planned to send her to my son-in-law's house, but I met Gong Yutang on the way. So Gong accompanied his daughter to her husband's house. (Question) How many clothes did your daughter have when she got married? (Answer) More than one hundred pieces. (Question) Were many pieces taken by Miss Gong? (Answer) Miss Gong definitely took them away successively, and so on. At this point in the questioning, the plaintiff's lawyer stated, although the witness Cai Changsheng is the father-in-law of the plaintiff, his daughter is deceased and he is now a kind of relative. This testimony should be adopted. The judge announced that the defendant was not present today and the hearing would be continued at a later date. The court was then adjourned.</p>

<p>Judge Mediates in Court</p>
<p>Zhu Xingbao, a young woman from this city, recently retained lawyer Xu Xingti to sue her husband, Yu Afu, in the local court for abuse, abandonment, and failure to provide support, requesting a divorce. The court had previously held a hearing on the case, but it was not concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Keqian held another hearing. After briefly questioning both parties, the judge attempted to mediate a settlement in court. Initially, neither party would comply, but after an hour of the judge's persuasion, a settlement was reached. The plaintiff, Zhu Xingbao, paid the defendant, Yu Afu, two hundred yuan. The defendant then returned a suitcase and twelve items of clothing to the plaintiff. Both parties expressed satisfaction. After the judge gave some further guidance to both parties, the judge drafted a settlement record in court and ordered both parties to sign it. From then on, they separated like scattered swallows, severing all ties. The court was then adjourned.</p>

<p>Rickshaw Driver Thinks It's Kidnapping</p>
<p>Actually an Attempt at Extortion</p>
<p>Zhang Sibao, a woman from Changzhou, just turned twenty. She came to Shanghai with her husband in the spring of 1928 and found work in a yarn factory through an acquaintance. Before long, her husband was idle and unemployed, and life was difficult. He pawned Sibao into the Wu surname brothel in the Xiaohua Garden in the Public Concession, for a term of two years. Sibao entered a cage, as this flesh and blood career was compelled to be like this, and it was something she was not really willing to do. Time passed quickly, and now the term has expired, and her husband is nowhere to be found. She wants to leave the sea of suffering, but she has nowhere to live. Recently, there was a customer named Xia Jinbao, who was very like-minded with her. Sibao then left the Wu surname brothel last week and went straight to Xia Jinbao's home at No. 8 Xie Xingli, Bailinan Road, Western Shanghai. Xia has not yet married, and he is happy to have such a good partner, so they are together. Unexpectedly, good things are often hampered. Suddenly, three or four of Xia's fellow offenders, Wang Qiaolin and Zhu Xiaoliu, thought they were having fun together, and their jealousy flared up and tried to stop them in every possible way. Seeing that Sibao was determined, they decided to collude to extort money. The night before last, they went to Xia's house to extort forty yuan from Xia. Xia refused to pay because he had no money to raise. Yesterday afternoon, at about 4 p.m., Wang, Zhu, and the other three or four men waited near Xia's residence. Soon Sibao went out to shop. Wang and the others rushed up and grabbed Sibao. At the same time, they hired a taxi with the Concession registration number 17767 and dragged Sibao into the car, intending to take her to the Concession and find a way to deal with her. Unexpectedly, the driver saw a group of people forcibly abducting a woman and was afraid of being kidnapped. He was suspicious and frightened, so he stopped the car at the intersection of Yidingpan Road after only a few steps. He was about to report to the police there, but Wang and the others saw the opportunity and panicked, jumping out and fleeing. Only the woman was left in the car. The driver immediately turned around and drove back to the Wujiaochang area of Bailinan Road, immediately reported to the patrol chief of the sixth district, and took the woman back to the sixth district police station to await investigation.</p>

<p>Zhu Huang, a twenty-two-year-old woman from Changzhou, residing in Maojia Lane outside the Dadongmen, is still pretty. At about 3 p.m. yesterday afternoon, she went to Beishi to shop. When she was walking to the Guomalu intersection of the 16th Pier, Gao Mingsheng, a Tongzhou man who works as a boatman, came up to her in a hurry. He raised his hands and touched her chest, groping her breasts, and then ran away immediately. She quickly chased after him and managed to grab him. She then called out to Zang Yaochen, the guard at the twelfth post there, who took him back to the First District Headquarters. He was ordered to be detained temporarily, pending preliminary review by the District Chief.</p>

<p>The Standing Committee of the Lawyers Association sent a telegram to the military and judicial organs in Beijing and Jiangsu, saying: To President Wang of the Nanjing Judicial Yuan, Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Justice, President Lin of the Supreme Court, Chief Prosecutor of the Procuratorate, Minister of Military and Political Affairs, President Lin of the Jiangsu High Court in Suzhou, and Chief Prosecutor Wang, I admire your deeds. Recently, our members Cai Nipei, Shan Yuhua, Shen Zhaojiu, and Liu Zuwang sent letters stating that Ding Lei, the warden of the Third Branch Prison of Jiangsu and the director of the detention center, transferred dozens of criminal defendants from the prison to the Second Army Prison, where they were treated as convicted military prisoners. The families of the parties concerned have repeatedly requested guarantees. In addition to the victims filing a lawsuit against the director of the prison according to the law, please send a telegram to the competent authority according to the situation, quickly suspend the director of the prison from his post and bring him to justice for interrogation, and at the same time transfer all the offenders who were sent to the Army Prison back to protect them. It is said that the regulations of the detention center have clear provisions on the extent of the restrictions on the food, clothing, housing, and transportation of criminal defendants in custody, while the treatment in prisons is even more severe. They shall not be sent to prison for execution until the verdict is final and guilty. The Army Prison is not within the scope of the judiciary, and its treatment is even more different from that of ordinary prisons. The director of the prison transferred criminal defendants who had not been convicted to the Army Prison, which is obviously an abuse of power. Moreover, the Army Prison, regardless of the crime of each prisoner or whether there is a legal certificate from the superior officer, will accept them, which not only tramples on human rights and destroys the dignity of the judiciary, but also has this shocking act at the time of the abolition of consular jurisdiction, which is enough to make people laugh at home and abroad and obstruct the recovery of legal rights. For this reason, we respectfully request your attention, and order the director of the prison, Ding Lei, to be suspended from his post and brought to justice for interrogation, and immediately transfer the offenders in the Army Prison to ensure that the truth is corrected and to maintain the dignity of the judiciary. Liu Zuwang, Jiang Yiping, and Yu Zhongluo, standing committee members of the Shanghai Lawyers Association, kowtow.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Assisting in the Implementation of Stamp Duty <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Shops That Do Not Affix Stamps Will Be Sued</p>
<p>Since the Jiangsu Stamp Duty Office in Shanghai appointed Liu Chunpu and Shen Rulin as special commissioners for stamp duty in the French Concession, the French Concession Stamp Duty Office has made active progress on stamp duty in the French Concession for two months, and the results have been improving day by day. Now that the shops in the Public Concession that do not affix stamps have been negotiated by the Shanghai Stamp Duty Office to be sued by the police to the Special Court for fines at any time, the two special commissioners Liu and Shen specially requested the Jiangsu Stamp Duty Office in Shanghai to formally contact the French Concession authorities and planned to follow the example of the Public Concession. It is now known that the two special commissioners Liu and Shen have received a reply from the Shanghai Office and have negotiated with the French authorities. All shops in the French Concession that have not affixed stamps will immediately implement a search for evidence and select those who are punished. The original letter is recorded below: To start with, regarding the punishment of the shops in the French Concession that have not affixed stamps, this office has negotiated with the French Concession authorities. Now it is urgent to select those who are punished to serve as a warning. Please check more than ten or even twenty documents (one for each family) and send them to this office for verification and handling, and I hope to do so as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In addition, the French Concession Stamp Duty Office issued a notice to various shops, saying: For the matter of notification, it is found that these special commissioners have been appointed by the Shanghai Office of the Stamp Duty Bureau of Jiangsu Province of the Ministry of Finance to handle stamp duty matters in the French Concession, and they have rented No. 18 Zhenpingli, Gelo Road, and started work on April 1. It has been notified repeatedly, and the General Assembly of Representatives of the Taxpaying Chinese in the French Concession and the Road Chambers of Commerce has also been notified in a comprehensive manner. Stamp duty is a good tax that is commonly used in various countries, and it is collected from merchants and the people. The amount is very small. Affixing stamps only costs one or two cents. Once something happens, it can have the effect of proving legal benefits. The national tax revenue relies on this to accumulate small amounts into large amounts. The merchants and people in the concession are all members of the national community. They should all inspire patriotism and use stamps together. It has been decided that the Public Concession will implement inspections this month, and those who hide and do not affix stamps will be sued for punishment. The French Concession is the same. The authorities have been asked to investigate and handle it. If the merchants in the concession rely on their establishment in the concession and make excuses to wait and see and try to be opportunistic, once they are found out, they will be reported to the police and asked to be summoned to the French public office on a household basis and punished according to the law. The special commissioners will take measures to seek peace. The merchants in the concession should all follow this intention and not lose sight of the bigger picture and hurt their reputation. For this reason, this notice is issued, and all merchants and people should abide by it. They must all check themselves, and those who have missed it should affix the stamps as soon as possible. Once they are found out and reported, it will be too late to regret it. Do not misunderstand yourselves.</p>

<p>Please ask the Central Government to stop the Swedish Merchants from establishing a match factory</p>
<p>Please all rise up together and fight together</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions issued a telegram yesterday, saying: I admire you (a brief address). I secretly investigated that our country's production is backward and has been subjected to various aggressions by imperialists, especially economic aggression policies are rampant, sucking fat and absorbing cream, resulting in national poverty and the depletion of vitality. The national economy and people's livelihood are as dangerous as a pile of eggs. If we do not catch up quickly and immediately plan to save the industry, we will be doomed to eternal destruction. Thinking about this, can we not be alarmed? Recently, it was heard that the imperialist country of Sweden is carrying out economic aggression and attacking our country. Previously, a large number of matches were continuously transported to China and sold at low prices, causing the gradually flourishing match industry in our country to be hit hard and closed down one after another. Those who can barely survive have all reduced their scope to preserve a glimmer of hope for the match industry. Now the Swedish Match Company is carrying out further aggression and is establishing a factory in Zhoujiadu, Shanghai, purchasing two or thirty acres of land. The factory is fully powered by machinery for manufacturing and is scheduled to open. The capital is abundant. The match industry will undoubtedly be monopolized by the company, and the national match industry will also be completely closed down. Hundreds of thousands of workers will also lose their jobs as a result. Not only will the future of people's livelihood be greatly affected, but also the purpose of our party's industrial salvation will be severely damaged. Moreover, the company's factory base is located in the Chinese territory, and it dares to openly and recklessly act as a base camp for aggression without any scruples. If it is not stopped and allowed to act recklessly, foreigners will follow suit one after another, and our country's sovereignty will be almost non-existent. This association is the general hub of the labor movement in Shanghai. It deeply understands the daily deepening of foreign insults and takes the responsibility of every man. I respectfully ask the central government to immediately stop the opening of the factory, and I hope that all institutions and civil society groups will uphold the justice of patriotism and make every effort to oppose it in order to maintain our country's industry and protect the livelihood of the workers. It is fortunate for the party and the country. In addition to leading the 800,000 workers in Shanghai to swear to oppose it to the death, this association is hereby reporting it. The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipal Federation of Trade Unions kowtows.</p>

If we do not cooperate fully, it is difficult to achieve good results. Now that the Anti-Smuggling Department has been established recently, it is time for the two parties to cooperate. With the consent of both parties after consultation, it is planned to appoint the responsible personnel of the inspection departments in each property, the assistant inspection officers and the assistant staff directly under the jurisdiction of the Inspection General Office as anti-smuggling supervisors in each property.

(3) If the anti-smuggling supervisor has any suggestions for improving anti-smuggling matters, he shall consult with the director of the anti-smuggling bureau, and may report it to the inspection general office for transfer to the anti-smuggling department for verification and handling. (4) If the anti-smuggling bureau dismisses personnel without the order of the anti-smuggling department or without sufficient reason, and appoints people locally to supplement them, the anti-smuggling supervisor shall report it to the inspection general office for transfer to the anti-smuggling department for verification and handling. (5) If the director of the anti-smuggling bureau has any situation to report to the anti-smuggling department regarding the appointment or dismissal of personnel, he shall send a letter to the anti-smuggling supervisor for verification so that he can express his opinions on the situation to the inspection general office for reference and verification by the anti-smuggling department. (6) All administrative matters within the authority of the director of the anti-smuggling bureau and the official correspondence between the anti-smuggling department shall be conveyed by the inspection general office.

<h3 id="e118">Continued Report on the Slowdown in the Mechanical Department <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Over seven hundred workers in the mechanical department of the French Water and Electricity Company, due to unmet demands, initiated a slowdown strike. It has been three days. Yesterday at 3:30 PM, a general meeting was held at the Ximen Public Sports Ground, chaired by Xu A’mei. (1) Regarding the case of the factory employing White Russians to undermine the labor movement, it was resolved to petition the higher authorities to negotiate with the factory. (2) A letter was sent to the Chinese staff of the company requesting assistance. (3) Xu Yefu, a representative of the Municipal Party Department, attended to provide guidance. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM. During the meeting, Wang, the director of the Second District General Office, specially dispatched patrol officers Gao Ziqiang and Gao Hongbin, leading many police officers, to the site to maintain order. The declaration and advisory letter are recorded below.</p>
<p>Declaration of the French Water and Electricity Workers' Union on being forced to strike: We, the seven hundred workers, have been rejected and not accepted by the capitalist French Water and Electricity Company. They have locked their iron gates and driven us seven hundred workers out, without even listening to us. What a heartbreaking matter! We workers spend the whole day working like machines for the capitalists, and the wages we earn with our sweat are not enough to buy food. This is not how things should be under the leadership of the Three Principles of the People. The wage increase we workers are requesting this time is very limited. Other demands, such as an eight-hour workday and year-end bonuses, are not excessive. However, the capitalists, with a bit of conscience, should have been able to sympathize with our cries of suffering and misery from exhaustion. But their exploitative and oppressive measures are commonplace and not surprising at all. Our appeals are like idle dreams. Therefore, three notices were met with stern rejection and extreme rigidity, which aroused the anger of the workers. A meeting resolved to unanimously start a slowdown strike on the 18th to awaken the factory. Unexpectedly, instead of us slowing down, they simply wanted us to start a strike. On the morning of the 19th, our workers went to the factory as usual to slow down, but the factory actually drove the workers out and closed the iron gates. Alas, this rigid attitude has made us disappointed and saddened. We now really want to strike but cannot. Our strike can be completely attributed to the factory's creation and oppression. We now only request assistance from higher party and government agencies on the one hand, and on the other hand, we all unite together, vow to persevere to the end, and strive peacefully. We will never give up until we achieve our goals. Our slogans: (1) Workers unite together! (2) Implement the Three Principles of the People! (3) Realize the Three-Eight System! (4) Overthrow the running dogs colluding with capital! (5) Strictly prevent reactionary elements from taking advantage of the situation! (6) Support the French Water and Electricity Workers' Union!</p>
<p>Advisory Letter from the Workers' Union to Chinese Staff of the Company requesting assistance: Dear Sirs, The reason our union members are making demands to the capitalists this time is a matter of vital importance to our livelihoods. Unexpectedly, the capitalists sternly rejected us with three notices. The Municipal Party Department and the Social Bureau have mediated, but the capitalists' attitude is rigid, which is truly unbearable. Furthermore, they closed the iron gates yesterday morning and deceived and drove away the workers, causing hundreds of workers to want to strike but be unable to. The capitalists' oppression of us Chinese workers could not be worse. Moreover, any of our compatriots with a little conscience cannot but be filled with indignation. Our union, on behalf of all workers, vows to fight to the death and will not stop until we achieve our goals. Correspondingly, we respectfully request you to investigate. We hope that comrades will uphold the spirit of mutual assistance among compatriots, rise up and shout, and assist the workers. We will be eternally grateful.</p>

<p>Shi Guanlin Couple Quarrel</p>
<p>Shi Guanlin, a Jin Tan native residing at No. 187 Tangjia Lane, works as a helmsman on inland riverboats. His wife, Zhou, works at a nearby silkworm moth (also known as scraps) factory. They have four children. Guanlin has been ill for a long time and has been sitting at home eating away at their resources. Recently, due to the large population, they often suffer from food shortages. He gave his eight-year-old son to a friend to ease the burden. Zhou did not want this, and quarrels often arose. In his resentment and anger, Guanlin suddenly had a pessimistic thought of ending his life. Yesterday afternoon, while his wife went to work at the factory, he swallowed opium in an attempt to die. When Zhou returned home from work, she saw her husband lying stiff on the bed, unresponsive, with a pale face. She found the remaining opium on the ground. Realizing he had taken poison, she immediately rushed him to Puji Hospital. According to the doctor, he must vomit out the poison, otherwise his life would be in danger.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Female Hostess Requests Divorce <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Unsuccessful Mediation in Court</p>
<p>Judgment Scheduled for the 26th</p>
<p>Huang Niu (i.e. Huang Qihong), a Cantonese man, works in the shipping industry. His wife, Deng Fengjin, is also from Guangdong. The couple is the same age, 32 years old each. Deng is quite independent and currently works as a hostess at a merchant club in the French Concession. Her income is not bad and she does not need to rely on her husband for a living. Therefore, she filed for divorce at the Special District Local Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Wenrong held a court hearing. According to the plaintiff Deng Fengjin, she married Huang on April 14th, 1911. They were initially in love, but after Huang lost his job, he became addicted to gambling and smoking. His family had no permanent property, so I had to throw myself into a merchant club in the French Concession as a hostess to make a living. Later, Huang also found a job on a Wuhu ship, but he still did not send any money home. Although I had a slight wage, it was not enough to cover expenses, so I borrowed money to get by. I now owe no less than a thousand yuan. Four years ago, Huang returned to Shanghai from Wuhu and asked me for a hundred yuan. I gave him seventy yuan, and since then he has been asking me for forty-five yuan per month, otherwise he would threaten me. On the 18th of last month, he again forcibly demanded money. I had no choice but to take my six-year-old adopted daughter and temporarily return to my mother's home to avoid his demands. Since he does not support me, I request a divorce. Huang Niu testified that he married Deng in the Republic of China in 1909. Since I found a job on a ship, I have never asked Deng for a cent. But because she worked at the club, I was indeed dissatisfied, but she would not listen. I told her father, but he could not control her either, saying she was free to do as she pleased. She became more reckless, and her romantic behavior spread among the public. A certain tabloid once recorded it. To save face, I decided to take her to live in Wuhu and ordered her to resign from her hostess job, but she did not take my words seriously and neither resigned nor left. She still holds the position, staying out all night and returning only at dawn. I am not wealthy, and marrying one wife is already extremely difficult. I cannot agree to the plaintiff's request for divorce. Her so-called debt of more than a thousand yuan was also spent by herself, and I never received a penny from it. He also hired a lawyer to argue that the plaintiff's request for divorce was for other purposes, which would be realized after the divorce. The lawyers from both sides argued with each other, and Judge Xu advised the plaintiff to take a step back and reconcile. However, she insisted on her position, so the court did not waste any more words and ordered the parties to wait for the verdict on the morning of the 26th of this month.</p>

The money was robbed by thieves in the Pudong River, who shot and injured Chinese and foreign employees, killing two people. Afterwards, the police arrested many criminals. Because the Pudong River is under the jurisdiction of the inland government, several of the arrested criminals have been transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for investigation. On the 14th of this month, the Laozha Police Station arrested Zhang Genbao and Yao Zucheng from Pudong. Under interrogation, they confessed that one of their accomplices, Feng Qing, was hiding in Pudong. Chinese and foreign detectives secretly went to Pudong a few days ago and arrested Feng. He was brought to court yesterday morning. According to Feng, he only knew that they were going to rob land and accompanied them, but he did not do anything himself. Judge Zhou ordered the defendant to be detained and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

The man's left foot was run over by the locomotive. Blood flowed profusely, and most of his white shirt and pants were dyed red, which was a terrible sight.

He immediately reported to the Third Section Fire Brigade to use a fire truck to transport him to the hospital for treatment. It is said that the man lost too much blood after the injury, and his life may be in danger.</p>

Every day after 3 o'clock, students are compelled to exercise, including running, high jumping, ball games, and other competitive sports. Their outstanding achievements are the best in Japan. The most unusual thing is that during exercise, all students wear sportswear, consisting only of a tank top and shorts, no different from what men wear. The teachers at the school guide various sports and swimming exercises with great enthusiasm, showing no feminine affectation whatsoever. Such emphasis on physical education is not even surpassed by our country's specialized physical education schools. Following this, I was received by the city government, and with the permission of the Imperial Household Agency, I was able to visit the Imperial Palace in Japan. According to the ancient Kyoto Palace records, there are five locations: the Imperial Palace (御所), the Sento Imperial Palace (仙洞御所), the Nijo Detached Palace (二條離宫), the Katsura Detached Palace (桂離宫), and the Shugakuin Imperial Villa (修學院離宫). Due to time constraints, I only visited the Imperial Palace. The interior is extremely solemn. One palace depicts images of famous scholars and officials from the Tang and Song dynasties of our country, such as the hall where the Emperor received his vassals (天皇朝見諸候殿), the Shishinden Hall where the Emperor was enthroned (天皇就職加寃之紫宸殿), and the Seiryoden Hall where the Emperor relaxed (天皇游覽之清凉殿). Each was a sight to behold. The ancient customs and rituals refreshed my spirit. Afterwards, I went to the Kyoto Prefecture to inquire about educational matters in detail. I learned that there are 383 elementary schools, of which 86 are established by Kyoto City, while the rest are distributed to various districts. There are over 1.92 million children, and only about 800 children of school age are not enrolled. A majority of elementary school graduates continue their education. The average monthly salary for male teachers in elementary schools is 82 yuan, while for female teachers it is over 55 yuan. The average monthly salary for male specialist teachers in elementary schools is 57 yuan, while for female teachers it is 46 yuan. The average monthly salary for principals of lower elementary schools is 123 yuan, and for principals of complete elementary schools, it is 160 yuan. The total amount of annual seniority pay for elementary school teachers is over 37,000 yuan from the city and over 78,000 yuan from the county. All elementary school teachers in rural villages are provided with housing or housing subsidies. In order to encourage children to attend school, there are scholarship savings, with over 90,000 yuan allocated annually from the national treasury, and the remainder is planned by the prefecture. There are 68 public kindergartens and 51 private kindergartens in Kyoto Prefecture. In Japan, kindergartens are often separated from elementary schools and established independently, and the local government strongly encourages the establishment of private kindergartens. The Kyoto Prefectural Normal School has one school for men and one for women, each with two divisions and a specialized course for women. The Women's Normal School also has a nursery training institute, aiming to train kindergarten teachers. Kyoto Prefecture has eight middle schools, with a total of 135 classes. There are eleven private middle schools, with a total of 119 classes. The prefecture has eleven higher girls' schools, with a total of 143 classes. There are twelve private ones, with a total of 107 classes. The prefecture has sixteen vocational schools, and there are three private ones, with the majority being agricultural, followed by industrial. The prefecture has one medical university and one women's specialized school, divided into arts and science departments. In addition, there are schools for the blind and deaf, providing facilities for special education. As for Kyoto City, there are 22 kindergartens with 88 staff members and 2,429 children. There have been 1,674 graduates. There are 85 elementary schools with 1,750 staff members and 75,277 children. There have been over 130,000 graduates. There are ten vocational supplementary schools for girls, and one school each for the blind and deaf. There are thirteen girls' schools and middle schools each, and seven vocational schools, with 273 staff members and 4,795 students. The normal school has a one-year program, with 77 staff members, 972 students, and 255 graduates. There is one higher school, with 58 staff members and 979 students. There are fourteen specialized schools, with 523 staff members and 5,444 students. There are four private universities, with 340 staff members and 3,325 students. There are two public universities, with 631 staff members and 6,294 students. There have been 1,264 graduates. In addition, there is a commemorative zoo, housing 94 species of mammals, 1,099 species of birds, 136 species of reptiles, and 2 species of amphibians. There is also the Enshi Kyoto Museum, with 1,124 historical exhibits, 1,140 art exhibits, and 619 craft exhibits. All of these social educational facilities are particularly admirable to us.</p>

<p>Zhejiang Province Promulgates Methods for Holding</p>
<h3 id="e148">Courses on Phonetic Symbols in Each School District <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education considers phonetic symbols to be a powerful tool for unifying the national language and implementing mass education. Recently, it specially formulated a method for holding phonetic symbol training courses in each school district in the province, in order to provide sequential training. The government ordered each city and county to comply with the method, and also ordered the provincial middle schools to supervise the affiliated elementary schools to properly determine the method for holding phonetic symbol training courses in each school district, and to report the progress in detail for review. The methods for holding phonetic symbol training courses in each school district are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The phonetic symbol training courses in each school district shall be sponsored by the elementary schools affiliated with the provincial middle schools, and the Mandarin teachers of this middle school who have studied phonetic symbols will be responsible as lecturers to convene elementary school teachers and administrative personnel from each county and city in this school district for training. The training course will be named the Zhejiang Province No. ○ School District Phonetic Symbol Training Course.</p>
<p>2.  Each county and city government must send at least four current elementary school teachers and administrative personnel from the county to attend the lectures. Their travel and food expenses will be provided by the respective organizations, but those who voluntarily attend must bear their own expenses, and should notify the affiliated elementary school in advance.</p>
<p>3.  The training period is limited to one week. The opening date will be determined by each affiliated elementary school based on the situation in the school district, and the county and city governments will be notified.</p>
<p>4.  The course distribution is as follows:</p>
<p>勹 Pronunciation Method 120 minutes</p>
<p>夊 Pronunciation Practice 240 minutes</p>
<p>口 Spelling Practice 240 minutes</p>
<p>匚 Tone Practice 120 minutes</p>
<p>万 Word and Sentence Practice 240 minutes</p>
<p>Calligraphy Practice 120 minutes</p>

<p>5.  After the training period, the attendees from each county and city should return to their respective counties and cities to be responsible for publicity and explanation. The methods will be determined by each county and city.</p>
<p>6.  The lecturers of the training course may be given appropriate honorariums, and the office staff may be given appropriate allowances. Other miscellaneous office expenses will be paid from the contingency fund of each middle school in the 18th or 19th year, but shall not exceed 100 yuan at most.</p>
<p>7.  After the training course is completed, the affiliated elementary schools of each middle school should report the progress to the Department of Education for record.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Instructions to the Supervisory Office for Students Studying in Japan <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Review and Approval of Qualifications of Graduates from University Preparatory Courses and Specialized Schools, etc. The Ministry of Education, based on the report from Wang Keren, the supervisor of students studying in Japan, requesting clarification on nine matters concerning students studying abroad, hereby selects and records several important matters on the left: (1) Should graduates of a two-year university preparatory course and graduates of a four-year specialized school have the same qualifications, or which is higher and has the priority to receive the Boxer Indemnity? (Ministry of Education Instructions) Graduates of a two-year university preparatory course and graduates of a four-year specialized school, the latter's qualifications are higher. (2) Was the former Beijing Sino-French University a national or private institution, and if private, has it been registered? (Ministry Order) The Sino-French University is a private institution, formally recognized by the former Beijing Ministry of Education, but has not yet been approved for registration by this Ministry. (3) Have Beijing Chaoyang and China Universities been registered? (Ministry Order) Neither Chaoyang nor China University has been approved for registration. (4) In the past, your Ministry stipulated the method for granting Boxer Indemnity to Class A female auditors, stipulating that in the future, female students who have equivalent qualifications to enter a university department, who attend university courses and whose performance is comparable to that of male students, should still be allowed to receive the Boxer Indemnity according to the Class B qualifications. Since female students cannot be considered as attending and being tested at the beginning of their studies, and it is also impossible to know whether their performance can be comparable to that of male students, can they still receive the Boxer Indemnity according to the Class B qualifications at this time? (Ministry Order) Testing includes various tests upon enrollment and during studies. The treatment of Class A female auditors is completely the same as that of undergraduate male students, which has been clearly explained in Instruction No. 937. (4) Currently, there are people who take advantage of the situation and try to obtain subsidies. They often hold official documents from local governments or schools granting subsidies of 400 yuan in order to obtain the qualifications of government-funded students and receive the Boxer Indemnity. It is proposed that your Ministry stipulate that in the future, those who receive subsidies from local governments or schools must submit a certificate of government-funded study abroad issued by the Department of Education of each province to the Ministry for approval before they can be considered as government-funded students. (Ministry Order) Those who receive certificates for self-funded study abroad, regardless of whether they have received subsidies from schools or other organizations, will be considered as self-funded students. (6) In the future, it is proposed to use the public Zhe telegraph code published by the Commercial Press for telegrams, which is more economical. (Ministry Order) It should be approved.</p>
<p>Recalling Overseas Chinese Education Rights in Taiwan</p>
<h3 id="e150">Petition Representatives Being Expelled from the Country <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>There are nearly 50,000 overseas Chinese in Taiwan. The education of their children has always been controlled by the Japanese government in Taiwan, who have been implementing a slave-like education. Conscious members of the overseas Chinese community have initiated the organization of a petition group to reclaim the rights to overseas Chinese education in Taiwan, and have elected Chen Renshan and others as representatives. They returned to the country in February and March of this year to petition, requesting the assistance of the Overseas Chinese Association in this port. The association immediately submitted the petition to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central Government in Nanjing, as well as the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, requesting prompt approval. The representatives personally went to Beijing to petition and received approvals stating that after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sends someone to Taiwan to establish a consulate, the matter will be handed over to the consul stationed in Taiwan for handling. However, it has been nearly four months since the Overseas Chinese Association received the approval, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet sent anyone to Taiwan. It is also unknown how the overseas Chinese education there should be handled before the envoy is sent. Chen Renshan, one of the representatives who traveled long distances back to the country to petition, was rejected from returning to Taiwan due to this incident. The following is a brief account of Chen Renshan's expulsion: The Overseas Chinese Association recently received a letter from a certain overseas Chinese organization in Taiwan stating, "After investigation, Comrade Chen Renshan is extremely enthusiastic about overseas Chinese affairs and overseas Chinese education. It is a pity that he was deported as soon as he arrived in Taiwan. The reasons for his deportation can be described by Comrade Chen himself," etc. It also received a letter from Mr. Chen stating, "On May 10th, I departed from my hometown of Wenzhou with my family to go to Taiwan. I arrived in Fuzhou first, and on the 28th, I boarded the Daikyu Maru. I landed at Tamsui Port in Taiwan the next day. I went to Taipei on the same day and stayed briefly at the Chinese Association. Suddenly, many police detectives arrested me and took me to the Taipei Prefecture Police Department. They said that I was agitating the overseas Chinese in Taiwan, returning to the country to petition, etc., and claimed that I was an ideologically inappropriate person. They immediately issued an expulsion order. Because there was no ship available for export at the time, I was detained in the police station for three days. On June 1st, I was sent to Keelung and placed in the bottom of the hold of the Daikyu Maru for about six hours. I only gained freedom after the ship set sail. I arrived in Fuzhou again the next day. The humiliation of me personally by the Taiwan authorities this time is purely the Japanese imperialists' oppression of the cultural movement of overseas Chinese in Taiwan, so that all our overseas Chinese will be enslaved by them. Since 1926, the Taiwan authorities have expelled more than a hundred overseas Chinese intellectuals. This not only destroys the cultural movement of overseas Chinese, but also insults our national dignity. Which citizen does not hate this? I have long admired your association's enthusiasm for overseas Chinese affairs. I dare to ask you to submit this matter to your association. At the same time, I hope that the newspapers in Shanghai will publish this matter in detail so that the people of the country will know the situation of overseas Chinese in Taiwan," etc. Based on this, the association immediately submitted it again to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Education, urging the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with Japan and send someone to Taiwan to protect the overseas Chinese and assist in overseas Chinese education as soon as possible. It is hoped that the diplomatic authorities will take concrete measures.</p>

<h3 id="e163">A Few Opinions on Preparing for the National Games by Wu Yunrui <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>In early April, during the National Games held in Hangzhou, it was heard that the Central Government had resolved to allocate 500,000 yuan for the capital to prepare for the next National Games. Before long, Yan and Feng raised troops, betraying the Central Government. Military affairs were pressing, and the economy was exhausted. Even in this turbulent time, the preparatory work for the National Games is still being actively carried out, which proves the Central Government's determination to build and its keenness to promote sports. All of us in the sports community should do our best to contribute our ideas to make this event perfect. Now that the preparatory committee has been announced and the chief and deputy secretaries have been appointed, the preparatory work, with its myriad details, will soon begin. As far as I can see, the most important thing is the construction of sports facilities. In beautiful and advanced countries, major cities all have magnificent and advanced stadiums, comparable to libraries and other public buildings. Now, the capital's stadium is chosen next to Linggu Temple, close to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum, which clearly intends to be as beautiful as Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum and be called a major central building. Its form and structure must be legal and beautiful, which goes without saying. Although I am not an engineer, I have observed sports architecture abroad and have done some research on implementation. Based on my sense of civic duty, I would like to discuss it with the preparatory committee.</p>
<h3 id="e164">(1) Construction Funding <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The cost of sports construction can range from millions to hundreds of thousands. The budget for the next National Games is a total of 500,000 yuan, which is not enough if it is all used for construction. Therefore, all hospitality expenses should be minimized. According to the previous National Games, the hospitality expenses were no more than 30,000 yuan. Therefore, 50,000 to 60,000 yuan is enough for the next National Games, and the remaining 400,000 yuan can be used for construction.</p>
<h3 id="e165">(2) Location of the Stadium <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The location of the stadium should be chosen in a place with convenient transportation and easy access for the public, so that it is convenient for daily use and can be enjoyed more often. If it is only for the National Games and does not consider the convenience of daily use, the effectiveness of the stadium will be minimal. Even if the architecture is exquisite, it will be in vain. Now, the location of the next National Games stadium has been selected next to Linggu Temple in the east of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum, taking into account its large area, beautiful scenery, and future urban construction plans, which is quite reasonable. However, it is too far from the city. It may be acceptable for people in cities with convenient transportation and families with cars, but not for Nanjing, which has inconvenient transportation, and the increasingly impoverished people of the Republic of China. Moreover, now that the civil war has restarted, construction has stopped, and there are still many vacant lots in the city. With financial difficulties and high construction costs, the construction outside the city is indefinite, and the stadium will have collapsed long before people move out of the city. This is also something that cannot but be considered. Although the location of the stadium has already been decided and cannot be reversed, why can't the swimming pool be located in a suitable place in the city, such as near the Lizhi Society and the public stadium? After the Games, tickets can be purchased to enter the pool, which can start a new trend of recreation for citizens. If the economy is insufficient, an outdoor swimming pool can be opened behind the afforestation office, using the spring water from Zijin Mountain as the pool water. In this way, the water will be automatically changed, which can save the cost of changing water on weekdays, like the outdoor swimming pool in IronClale, Missouri, USA, is a good example. A year ago, I led the Boy Scouts to camp next to this spring and had this idea. The cost of opening the spring is at most 10,000 yuan, which I hope the authorities will pay attention to.</p>
<h3 id="e166">(3) Allocation of Venues <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The venues must be divided into main and auxiliary venues. The main venue must be able to hold track and field events, football, volleyball, basketball, and other important events. The surrounding area must be built with bleachers. Like the stadium outside the Meiji Jingu Shrine in Japan, one side of the bleachers should be built and the other three sides should be built with grass slopes to save money. If the foothills can be used in Linggu Temple, it will be more economical. The bleachers should be able to accommodate at least 100,000 people. Because there are too many teams, auxiliary venues for basketball, football, volleyball, tennis, etc. can be built next to the main venue. If the economy is insufficient, there is no need to build bleachers. The next National Games venue should use all its financial resources to operate the main venue and not repeat the mistakes of the Hangzhou stadium by building bleachers in the auxiliary venues as well.</p>
<h3 id="e167">(4) Practical Issues of Construction <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>A. There are two types of running track forms: normal and curved (Korbogenform), and modified (including semi-circular and pointed circular). The stadiums of the German Sports University and the Amsterdam Stadium in the Netherlands all use the normal form to ensure that a legal football field can be built in the middle of the track. This spring, when I visited the construction of the Hangzhou stadium, the sand pits and runways were arbitrarily arranged inside the track without any rules, resulting in the football field being completely occupied. All important football matches cannot be played in this main venue. In the last few days, this venue was deserted, which greatly damaged the spirit of the Games.</p>
<p>B. The construction of the track itself is not a simple matter. It is usually divided into three layers. There are many formulas for the material of the upper layer, mainly composed of fine white coal ash, clay, and sand. It is definitely not something that can be done with pure fine coal ash. The long jump record in the previous National Games was at most 6.05 meters, which was due to the illegal construction of the long jump runway. The construction of the new stadium in the capital this time may also be the venue for the eleventh Far Eastern Games, and also the future World Games. It is related to the observation of both Chinese and foreigners. The preparatory authorities should pay attention to it.</p>
<p>C. The arrangement of the runways and throwing areas should avoid being inside the football field, which will destroy the football field. The Hangzhou National Games venue made this mistake. Germany is the most sophisticated in the construction of sports architecture. The high jump, long jump sand pit, and runway are all allocated inside the curved section of the track and outside the football field. If the north and south are not conducive to the wind, you can abandon this and choose that. The arrangement of the throwing areas in the Meiji Jingu Shrine stadium in Japan is modeled after Germany. I hope the preparatory authorities will pay attention to it.</p>

<p>The famous football player Li Huitang is scheduled to return to Hong Kong on the Asama Maru today, accompanied by his family. His return to Hong Kong is closely related to the Chinese football team's expedition to Europe. He plans to contact the elites of the Chinese and South China football teams in Hong Kong to discuss everything. When the time is ripe, he will unite the talents of the two places and embark on an expedition to Europe.</p>

<p>After the conclusion of the Capital Volleyball Competition, the Jiangsu Provincial Public Stadium immediately continued to hold the Capital Ping Pong Competition. There were 38 participants in the men's public relations group, 3 participants in the open group, 9 teams in the group A, 2 teams in group B, and only one team from Central University in the women's group, which had to be cancelled due to insufficient registration. It is learned that the competition started on the 8th of this month and ended on the 16th. Ouyang Yi won the championship in the men's open group, Qian Shuyi won the championship in the women's group, the Coco B team of Central University won the championship in the men's group A, and the Ziqiang team of Nan Zhong Shixiao won the championship in the men's group B.</p>

<p>All Shanghai Elites Participate</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the number of people skilled in handball in various universities and sports associations has been increasing recently, the Chinese YMCA has initiated a Chinese Handball Grand Competition. It has notified various institutions to gather all Shanghai elites and hold a singles competition first. Since the association announced this news, the number of applicants has been very enthusiastic. There are already more than ten people, including Gu Yongzhao, Sun Daosheng, Hong Yukui, Hong Rulin, Xu Changfa, Tan Zhonghua, Tan Dahua, Chen Hualu, Ni Hongen, Yan Zhaorong, Wu Chengmo, Huang Kesu, Chen Wentao, Yu Xiangsheng, and Wei Guanghan. Ling Xitao of the association is scheduled to invite the competition committee next Monday to discuss the grouping competition methods, rules, and other major issues. It is heard that those who intend to participate in this competition can register with Mr. Ling of the sports department of the association.</p>

<p>A: Last time, when I was on a ship with my wife crossing the sea, she accidentally fell into the sea on the deck. A shark swam up, looked at her, and then turned its tail and left, without eating her.</p>
<p>B: A narrow escape is a blessing in disguise. Your wife has boundless blessings. But why was that shark so civilized?</p>
<p>A: It probably had the same problem as me. As soon as it saw her face, it was frightened.</p>
<p>Passenger A on the tram: Hey, friend, I stood up to give my seat to this female passenger. Why did you sit down so impolitely?</p>
<p>Passenger B on the tram: It doesn't matter. This female passenger is my wife. We can accommodate each other in everything.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Talking About Airspace Issues by Huang Jiping <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Meteorological work is one of the most important sciences. All European and American countries are vigorously promoting it. The authorities do not hesitate to invest heavily in its operation and construction. There are meteorological stations and observatories on mountaintops, seashores, and in major trading ports. They recruit experts to devote themselves to their work. Their efforts are great, and their achievements are remarkable. Therefore, the discovery of stars and the observation of weather conditions are frequently reported in newspapers. Their influence on farmers, industrialists, and merchants is great. Our country's industries are backward, and even in this meteorological aspect, sovereignty has long been lost. How many of the famous astronomical institutions in the country are not controlled by others? It is lamentable to say. Since the establishment of the Institute of Meteorology and the Institute of Astronomy by the Academia Sinica, Chinese people have begun to pay attention. However, in the early stages, there is a shortage of talent, and it is important to seek expansion. The cultivation of talent is even more urgent. Do we not see that foreigners in the northeast and northwest border areas are ambitiously planning to overstep their authority? My friend Huang Xiaqian is a scholar of meteorology. He followed Dr. Zhu Kezhen in assisting with the work of the Institute of Meteorology in his early years. He is now teaching meteorology and climate courses at Tsinghua University and is preparing for a large-scale meteorological station. Recently, he talked with reporters about the crisis of China's airspace problem, which is quite alarming. I hereby explain it to the readers.</p>
<p>He said: The meteorological business seems to be gradually developing in our country. The airspace problem, which has not been paid attention to for a long time, may gradually enter the minds of Chinese people. It cannot be said that it is not a good phenomenon in recent years. However, the foundation of our country's meteorological business is very weak. The area of ​​the United States is comparable to ours. There are more than 3,170 large and small meteorological stations and observatories in the country. The annual expenses reach more than 2 million gold yuan. (approximately 8 million yuan in our country) The degree of development of Japan's meteorological business is not inferior to that of Europe and the United States in terms of area. In 1919, a marine meteorological station was added in Kobe. The construction cost was 400,000 yuan, of which 230,000 yuan was donated by the shipping industry. The recognition of the meteorological business by its people is also commendable. In recent years, a high-altitude meteorological station has been added in Tateyama near Tokyo for the purpose of researching aviation. The construction cost is 100,000 yuan. The scale is not small. The current meteorological business in our country cannot be compared with the United States and Japan. In terms of area, it cannot be compared with any small country in the world. Because our government does not know how to handle it, it allows foreigners to overstep their authority. The establishment of the Xujiahui Observatory by French priests is early and well-known. Most of the 47 customs weather stations are also managed by foreigners. Japan regards Manchuria as its operating area, so it has established a meteorological station in Dalian, Lushun, Yingkou, Liaoning, and Changchun. I have not seen any response from the Chinese people. Recently, Sven Hedin (transliteration), a Swede, privately established four meteorological stations in Xinjiang in the name of archaeology. (Ruoqiang, Dihua, Hami, Kuqa) After several years of observation, the records have been obtained. It has now been mailed to Germany for future aviation reference. These are all noteworthy events in the history of our country in recent years.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that foreigners' intentions to harm our country are obvious. If the Chinese people continue to kill each other and refuse to wake up, I really have infinite worries and cannot solve them.</p>

<p>Lost</p>
<p>There is a Chinese man named Bai Yongfu in Beixiadong 3rd Street, Xinyizhou, Korea. He is about 30 years old and is from Fushan, Shandong. Three years ago, he went to Korea to find work and lived there. He has been a carpenter for a living. After many years he'd saved some money. Last year, in January, he hired a matchmaker and betrothed a woman named Liu from the same hometown. The woman was twelve years old. Her biological father packed up and returned home. Bai welcomed the woman to his home to raise her. But dry firewood is close to fire, and he had long since actually carried out the role of foster parent. Unexpectedly, the lotus room dripped dew, and a pearl fetus was formed. By March of this year, she was pregnant for ten months. She gave birth to a son in one fell swoop. However, Bai suffered from excessive labor and developed hemoptysis. After three or four months, it did not work. By the middle of last month, he died. The young widow's life is difficult. She is looking for a good husband to prepare for another marriage.</p>
<p>Outside the east gate of Bu Kui, Heilongjiang Province, there was an old couple of Henan disaster victims last month. They led a boy and a girl. The girl was holding a child. They sat on the ground. There were many spectators at that time. A busybody asked about the surname and address. The old woman said that her surname was Wang and she was from Gushi County, Henan Province. The boy and girl are her son and daughter-in-law. The child held by the girl is her grandson. She also asked how old the boy and girl were. She replied that they were both twelve years old. She asked why they got married at the age of twelve. The old woman smiled and did not answer. Then she saw the child crying in her arms. The girl randomly breastfed him. The onlookers gave him hundreds of Jiang Qian. The old woman thanked him and left. Looking closely at the young couple, they were small and thin. The so-called twelve years old is definitely not a false statement. The development of human reproduction can also be seen from this. (But thank you)</p>
<h3 id="e175">One Evening's Talk with a Returnee from Japan by Bing <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>My old classmate Yang Jun has studied in Japan for ten years and has recently returned to China. He invited me to his hotel to talk late into the night. Many of the things we talked about are worth recording. I will write down two or three of them.</p>
<p>Yang Jun said that the Chinese side failed in the Tokyo Far Eastern Games. Although it was due to the unfairness of the Japanese referees and the lack of coordinated action training of our athletes, the fact is that Chinese education does not pay enough attention to sports. Someone suggested to the Ministry of Education that elementary schools should also be equipped with sports fields. Although it cannot be realized due to the current economic strength, it must be carried out in practice within the possible scope to cultivate a general national habit of paying attention to sports. Japanese elementary schools attach great importance to sports. The country has always regarded worshiping Bushido as its national soul, that is, the so-called Yamato soul. Elementary school students also use sword fighting as a game. The sword is made of bamboo or wood. They stab each other, stare, and puff out their chests, just like a samurai.</p>
<p>The Japanese like martial arts. Suicide is also heroic. Whether it is for economic reasons, love, or ethics, suicides are often reported in the newspapers. When they die, they either cut their stomachs, lie on the train tracks, or jump off high cliffs. Occasionally, they also drown themselves. There are few who die by hanging or taking anesthetics. Previously, Ryunosuke Akutagawa committed suicide, stating that he did so because he felt a hazy unease. He did not want to make people uncomfortable, so he took eye drops. The Japanese ridiculed him, saying that artists are not afraid of being born ugly, but they must not die beautifully. It can be said that the Japanese nation is inherently cruel, and suicide is also carried out in a cruel way.</p>
<p>Finally, Yang Jun showed me the public notice of the managers of students studying in Japan from various provinces, which was issued in response to a reporter from a Shanghai newspaper who commented on the affairs of studying in Japan. This led to a discussion of the history of studying in Japan and the issue of studying abroad. In 1905, the Japanese Ministry of Education issued regulations on the control of Qing and Korean students. Chen Tianhua, a student from Hunan, committed suicide by jumping into the sea because of this. All the students returned to China and established China Public School in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e176">A Letter Regarding Criticism of Mei Lanfang (Middle) Zhi <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The Western newspapers say that beauty cannot fully understand Mei's drama, and they have issued five miles of fog. If wisdom is not equal, how can it be forced to be the same? Those who do not deeply understand beauty have such a proposition, while those who understand it, such as Stork Young, have more than twenty articles published in the New York World and other newspapers. They have thoroughly analyzed the subtle points of Mei's performance. It has been translated and will be dedicated to you in a special publication soon. After reading it, you will know that there are many who understand it. Mr. Mei's trip is to get all the American yellow-haired and white-haired old people to dance with excitement. The situation is somewhat impossible, and those around him may not use this to be harsh. The theory of male women is viewed by those who value men over women and despise actors. It is not a compliment. However, in terms of words, Zhang Liang is like a woman, and Xie Lanfang has no frivolous meaning at all. Moreover, those around you have gained expertise in Western learning. They must know that foreign newspapers like to create strange words to attract attention, such as calling former French Prime Minister Clemenceau a tiger. Even drawing a cartoon of him is also a Yan Han and a tiger head, which is the same principle. If you must say that Mr. Mei's role is Dan, then not only is it true in China, but also in European dramas, it has always been the case that Bian becomes hairpin. Even now, the old habits have not disappeared. When Mr. Mei was in the United States, he met a Dan actor. It is not surprising that they looked at each other with their eyes. Why is it so precious? The word idol is very appropriate. Mr. Mei is not worthy of being worshiped by the Chinese people. However, I believe that the theory of the concentration of modern Chinese people's thoughts is that the worshipers should be famous figures in politics? Those who are alive are ruining the country every day, and those who are dead are spreading false theories. Should they be famous generals in the military? They are brave in internal wars but timid in national crises. Should they be famous scholars in academia? Those who hold on to the old only engage in plagiarism, and those who admire the new only engage in purchasing. Think about it with a calm mind. Mr. Mei has become famous with a skill. He has been studying hard for ten years, and he still feels that he is more virtuous than them. Those around you have been holding on to themselves in the morning. They have counted the characters of modern times and recorded their omissions. They should not regard my words as irrelevant. As for the words representing Oriental art, Mr. Mei has never claimed it. Even if there are exaggerated words, they are from the mouths of others, not Mr. Mei's responsibility. You quoted the Associated Press telegram, which also refers to drama. Why do you say that here? In the past, it was said that he represented the figures worshiped by the Chinese people. Mr. Mei has never dreamed of it. If the Chinese people can completely abandon the thought of fame and profit, do not fall under the power of money, and do not hesitate to blindly follow the path of novelty, but only devote themselves to literature and drama, and cultivate their minds, it is already a good thing. The word worship does not specifically refer to people with fame and leadership. Moreover, it does not match the original text. Then what is the meaning of the so-called "hard to close your eyes" and "Isn't it wrong?" When this news was heard in the country, there were many criticisms. Originally, there is no absolute theory of agreement in the universe, and what you have cited should be the speculation of boring people and the short comments to fulfill their responsibilities. You have been in the newspaper industry, so you have used the tools of quickly collecting money and the titles of digging wells when you are thirsty as a model to show that it is public opinion. Isn't it too silly? The Tianjin Ta Kung Pao has always been praised by the Chinese people for its comments. It once published a theory to praise Mr. Mei's success. The original text is in the Humanities Library and should be compiled for review. Then you will know that public opinion is not completely biased towards your instructions.</p>
<p>Hai. In 1915, all the students studying in Japan returned to China due to the 21 demands diplomatic issue raised by Japan. In 1918, all the students studying in Japan returned to China due to the military agreement issue. They also founded the National Salvation Daily in Shanghai. In 1928, the Jinan incident occurred, and most of the students studying in Japan returned to China. Scholars and politicians in the Japanese education circle often wondered why Chinese students studying in Japan engaged in anti-Japanese movements, which were even more intense than the general Chinese people. They did not know that the students studying in Japan stayed in that country and heard and saw the most stimulating things, so their anti-Japanese sentiments were also more intense. This is an inevitable trend.</p>
<p>Japan has the most students studying abroad, followed by the United States. There are many reasons for this relationship. Some people say that there are many students studying in Japan because of its proximity, the same language, the short time, the low cost, and the unstable political situation in China. The former Ministry of Education said that there are many students studying in the United States because it is easy to enter American schools and they can attend classes with domestic academic qualifications. Many of them return to China with graduation qualifications in less than two or three years, so self-funded students flock to them. In 1919, the German mark depreciated, and the number of students studying in Germany increased day by day. In 1920, there were more than 1,000 students studying in France and Germany. In 1923, German social life gradually recovered, and the number of students decreased day by day. There were also fewer people going to France. In the past, there were as many as 10,000 students studying in Japan during the crash course era. Recently, it has gradually decreased to 3,400 to 500 people. All of these can give us a glimpse of the reasons for the rise and fall of our students studying in various countries.</p>

<p>Chapter 12: Farewell Banquet, Parting Feast, Plucking Flowers to Keep a Beautiful Image; Famous Garden Gathering, Tea Tasting to Admire Lovely Features</p>
<p>Well, even though they waited a long time in vain, it was still considered losing at sunrise and gaining at sunset. The attendants busily began their roles, offering hot towels and lemon tea, their smiling faces conveying greetings and flattery. After a flurry of activity, A Jin was "more talk than rice porridge," while Ruiyun simply smiled silently. She was wearing a new light blue silk jacket embroidered with many black swallows. Her hair was styled in a fashionable bun, adorned with a red cactus flower. Her face was powdered snow-white, and the rouge extended from her cheeks to her eyelids. Her beauty was like a flower in early spring, and she constantly smiled. Zuo Shichen thought to himself, "Good, the 'golden gate of her heart' is now slightly ajar." Seeing her smile, he knew that she felt no displeasure. Looking at her flushed face and deep red lips, he knew she was preparing to be a bride. He sat at the head of a somewhat rectangular dining table, with A Jin on his right and Ruiyun on his left. He gazed at her for a moment and said, "You're especially beautiful today." Ruiyun didn't say anything, just smiled. A Jin said, "This fabric was a gift from Mr. Cheng. Our eldest aunt would never wear such clothes." Shichen asked, "Which Mr. Cheng?" Ruiyun replied, "You know him, the old Mr. Cheng from the Portland Cement Company. His concubine is one of our little sisters." Zuo Shichen nodded and asked, "Why did you style your hair today?" Ruiyun said, "Hurry up, I'm starving. Order for me." Zuo Shichen smiled, feeling that although her answer didn't address his question, his question didn't have much basis either. If she was happy to style her hair, she styled her hair; if she was happy to braid it, she braided it. Their complaints about being hungry were the real issue. They left the theater at six o'clock and had been running around outside without going home, so of course they were hungry. People often forget practical matters with empty talk. Whether or not to style hair is empty talk, while being hungry is a practical matter. So he casually picked up a menu and asked, "Well, what do you want to eat? Tell me, and I'll write it down for you." Ruiyun asked, "Do you think I look better with styled hair or braids?" Zuo Shichen laughed, "I asked you why you styled your hair, and you didn't answer me, just complained about being hungry. Now that I'm asking you to order, you're asking me about the hair and braids." Ruiyun said, "Tell me what you think." Zuo Shichen said, "Both look good. Ugly people look ugly with braids, and even uglier with styled hair. Pretty people look good with braids, and even better with styled hair." Ruiyun pouted and said, "You're always like this, never telling the truth when I ask you something." Zuo Shichen was exasperated, "Hey, isn't that the truth?" A Jin said, "No, that's what our eldest aunt said. Little Miss often wears braids, but when she goes to someone's mansion, she can't wear braids anymore, so she's getting used to styling her hair first, so her hair will be softer."</p>

<h3 id="e189">Rising Rice Prices in the Riverfront Rice Market <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Top White Rice Reaches 23 Yuan Outside the Customs</p>
<p>Yesterday, very few rice boats arrived at the wharves in Zhabei. Rice shops in this area, due to gradually dwindling stockpiles, have shown increased interest in purchasing. The price of white rice has been rising sharply, with top-grade rice already reaching 23 yuan outside the customs in off-market trading. Officially, regular rice has virtually no transactions, while central rice is generally quoted at around 22 yuan. Even second-grade rice is trading at 21 yuan, with the lowest at 20 yuan and a half, a sharp increase of more than 0.3 yuan compared to the previous market. Current riverfront stockpiles are dwindling. Although the Social Bureau has strictly enforced regulations, market transactions remain the same. Moreover, this high price of 23 yuan is a new record for the port. As the early rice has arrived in small quantities and sales are brisk, prices have increased by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan. A small amount of premium glutinous rice has been offered on the market, and the market is stable. The price of foreign rice has also been reported to be high, with a rapid increase of 0.5 yuan or even 1 yuan, reaching 19.4 yuan. ▲Sources of rice from the Shanghai South area are very scarce. Premium Changshu rice and Xichang rice have not arrived in port. Rice shops in Suzhou and Tongzhou are doing small-scale retail sales and are unusually diligent, but unfortunately there are no large quantities in stock to meet the market demand. The prices of various types of rice have generally increased. The market here mainly deals in medium-grade rice, so the prices differ slightly from the North area. However, rice from Tongli also costs around 20 yuan. The market for early rice in the South area is brisk, but rice from Tongzhou, Changzhou, and other areas is scarce in Shanghai. Only a small amount remains in warehouses, and merchants are holding onto their goods to speculate. The price of premium goods is also quoted at 19 plus yuan, and there is a slight indication of private trading. The market atmosphere is very active, and prices are also thriving. ▲Rice market news from Wuxi: The supply of rough rice and rice paddy in Wuxi has been dwindling in recent days, and the overall stock has been greatly reduced. Recently, merchants from Changshu have come to Wuxi to purchase rice, causing the market price of rough rice to soar to 17 yuan, which has affected the Shanghai rice market. However, it is said that the supply of japonica rice in Changshu is about to run out, so they have had to turn to neighboring counties to purchase it, and are also hoping for foreign rice to supplement the supply.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Flour and Wheat Market After the Order to Stabilize Prices <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The spot flour price fluctuated higher, while futures prices for all months decreased. Yesterday, the flour market presented a trend of near-term price declines and stable long-term prices. The surge in prices over the past week has been excessive. Although partly due to the high cost of raw materials and the lack of stock at factories, much of it was fueled by market sentiment due to the nature of the exchange. One side used its manipulative tactics, while the other took advantage of the factories' reluctance to sell, leading to repeated price hikes, reaching the highest levels ever seen. Yesterday, due to the Social Bureau's strict order to stabilize prices, and the exchange's increase in margin requirements and shortening of the payment period, most speculative long positions without real backing have been restrained. Due to the margin requirement, they had to gradually unwind their positions, thus greatly easing the situation of runaway price increases. If the supply of wheat can increase and the factories can release more stock, the market may be stabilized. As a result of the closing: this month's price was down 0.0275 yuan from the previous day, July was down 0.015 yuan, August was down 0.0125 yuan, September was down 0.0075 yuan, October was down 0.01 yuan, and November was down 0.0025 yuan.</p>
<p>Wheat futures slightly declined, spot sales were active. Yesterday, wheat futures showed a trend of leveling off and fatigue. Most speculative longs, fearing the strict orders from the Social Bureau and sensing that new supplies were arriving, seemed unwilling to push prices higher. Therefore, those who had made profits unwound their positions. Although the consolidated price of foreign wheat has not yet been communicated, the quoted prices have fallen within one yuan. Therefore, if the exchange rate can improve, it may also be a turning point for the wheat market. As a result, June, September, and October were each down 0.02 yuan from the previous day, July and November were each down 0.04 yuan, and August was down 0.03 yuan. The spot wheat market is trending stable, as factories have good purchasing intentions and supplies are not very active. The opening price of Yellow Buckwheat was 5.05 yuan per 50 kg, Shaobo wheat was 5.1 yuan, Shuangfeng wheat was 5.08 yuan, Gaoyou wheat was 4.975 to 4.93 yuan, Wuhe wheat was 5.13 yuan, totaling 1,760 bags. Shaoxing wheat was 5.1 yuan, Guandian wheat was 5.13 yuan, Yangzhou wheat was 4.93 yuan, Chongming wheat was 4.77 yuan, and Jiangbei wheat was 4.8 yuan to 4.85 yuan, Jiading wheat was 4.87 to 4.85 yuan, Jiangwan wheat was 4.85 yuan, Yuepu wheat was 4.75 yuan, and Pudong wheat was 4.7 yuan, totaling 10,000 bags. The opening price of old wheat from various sources was 5.4 yuan per 50 kg, totaling 1,500 bags, which were allocated to various factories for processing.</p>
<h3 id="e191">No. 1 Saigon Rice Rises Another 0.3 Yuan Plus <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the popularity of foreign rice increased, with large-scale purchases from inland and Zhejiang provinces, various ports along the Yangtze River, and the local market. Due to the high price of local rice, merchants are particularly eager to purchase foreign rice. The arrival and sales of No. 1 Saigon rice are both low. Because its quality is relatively high, buyers are paying more attention to it. The opening price reached 17.75 yuan, a sharp increase of 0.35 yuan compared to the previous market. Other types of rice increased by 0.25 to 0.3 yuan. The total market transactions were 43,000 to 44,000 bags, with rough rice accounting for one-quarter, large-grain rice accounting for 10,000 bags, small-grain rice accounting for 6,000 bags, and others accounting for 2,000 to 3,000 bags each. The prices were: No. 2 Saigon rice 16.7 yuan, large-grain rice 16.05 yuan, small-grain rice 16.6 yuan, Mindon rice 17.25 yuan, Kaga rice 17.25 yuan, and rough rice 16.05 yuan to around 15 yuan. There were 5,000 bags of Mindon rice from other regions, priced at 17.2 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Tea Market Trends Not Favorable <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Although there have been sporadic transactions in high-grade green tea recently, the actual situation remains unfavorable. The main product of green tea, Zhenmei, has accumulated over 10,000 boxes in Tunxi, Shexian, and Sui'an. The reason is that Morocco has excessive stock and the Russian Cooperative Society has not yet opened for business due to certain reasons. When it does open, the market will inevitably be extremely tight. The future of the green tea market is extremely pessimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Silk Market's Future Sinks Further into Despair <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, silk sales in foreign firms in this port became even more sluggish. Overseas silk mills remained quiet, artificial silk flooded the market, and there was no news of silk demand improving. The market was desolate. Yesterday, only Weicheng imported 20 bales of Jin Shuang Mo brand top-grade silk with 13 to 22 strands, uniformity of 82%, and new factory silk from July, priced at 1,130 taels. The future of the silk market is sinking further into despair.</p>

<p>Willing but Unable -</p>
<h3 id="e198">The Problem of Young People Seeking Education by Zhi Jing <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>School will soon be out for the summer, and we can hear the sound of "it's hard to study" everywhere. We can also see young people who are willing but unable to study, sighing and worrying that they don't know where they will get tuition for the next semester. Therefore, we will see countless young people who are forced to take detours, to bury their talents, and to abandon their proper path. This is such a painful thing! In fact, the founding fathers of the party and the country are shouting that youth are the essence of the country, the original vigor of the country, and the government should do its best to cultivate young people's good character and learning in order to consolidate the foundation of the party and the country. This is such a moving tone, this is how it should be! But why are there countless young people who are not able to study? Is it that these young people are willingly falling, or is it that the government has not made efforts to pay attention to the problem of young people seeking education? I regret that I have not received a report that proves this, so I dare not assume that my assumption is correct, so I have to remain in a state of doubt.</p>
<p>However, "schools are important places, and the poor should not enter." On the gates of those towering universities, there seem to be two strict and terrifying tiger-head plaques nailed invisibly, telling us poor boys that we have no choice but to lament in vain. Private schools are not worth mentioning. Even the most famous Central University, which was founded and maintained by the government with huge amounts of funding, still requires each student to have at least two to three hundred yuan per year to supplement it in order to study there, which is not feasible for young people from families with limited means to enjoy. Although the government has worked hard to establish several free schools, such as Shanghai Labor University, can these few free schools accommodate all young people who are willing but unable to study? In fact, we can still hear the sound of sighing that it is difficult to study everywhere, and we can see young people who are willing but unable to study worrying that they still don't know where they will get tuition for the next semester.</p>
<p>We all know that the large number of young people who are not able to study is an unfortunate state of social phenomenon. However, in our country, which is backward in industry, the manifestation of this social pathology can also be regarded as inevitable in fact. This is of course a whole social problem, but at least I personally believe that the urgent need to relieve the problem of being unable to study seems to be more important than other pathologies. It seems that this is a fundamental way to treat the problem. Young people are the essence of the country, the original vigor of the country, and genius is not necessarily the children of wealthy families, so if we want to save the country, we must do fundamental work, irrigate the essence of the country, cultivate the original vigor of the country, and provide as much as possible for the development of genius. In other words, we should try to relieve the young people from the despair of dropping out of school, so that those who are willing to study can reach the point where they can study if they are willing.</p>
<p>I regret that I have not thoroughly explored and analyzed various aspects of this issue, so I cannot offer a detailed relief plan. However, seeing the large number of young people who are unable to study, I have issued this call, hoping to elicit the sympathy of the general public, pay attention to this issue, and discuss fundamental and appropriate relief methods. I hope even more that the government will increase education funding as much as possible, so that national and provincial schools can provide free education to the poor, and provide economic assistance to private schools to reduce tuition fees, giving young people the possibility of "studying if they are willing." This is our hope, and this is our request.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Professor Brandte Resigns <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>The female professor of Guanghua University, Professor Bradly, is now going to resign. Her resignation letter states that she is returning to her home country to recuperate, but according to what we know, the real reason for her resignation is that she was ridiculed by the students at the Guanghua Fifth Anniversary Recreational Meeting. However, her tolerance is too narrow. Because of this small reason, she cried for two nights and now has sacrificed her position, which is not worth it. The day before yesterday evening, eight male and female students from the fourth grade set up a banquet in a restaurant to bid her farewell. The students felt reluctant to part with her because of the years of teacher-student relationship. The professor, although somewhat saddened, ultimately resigned because she was unwilling to be ridiculed. In short, although the professor has a narrow tolerance, it is also because she cherishes her reputation. (Bi)</p>
<h3 id="e200">Jiaotong University Improves Examination Method <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Jiaotong University in this port has always been strict with term exams, and has specially organized an Examination Committee, with the deans of each college and the directors of each department as members, to take overall charge of all examination matters. For this exam, the Ministry of Railways has decided to send personnel to invigilate, and at the same time, the committee will also have multiple invigilators to assist on site, so the situation of this exam will be more serious than in previous sessions. The Examination Committee now, in view of the previous method of one week of review and one week of exams, believes that this is detrimental to the health of the students. The former method caused students to become mentally scattered during the review period, and they could not review all the subjects. After the review period was over, there was an exam every day during the exam period. As a result, those who embraced Buddhism temporarily all studied day and night, neglecting food and sleep, in order to pass the exam. Now, in the summer, it is extremely easy to cause illness. In order to improve this, Director Qiu Weiyu, Chairman of the Examination Committee, proposed to the Academic Affairs Meeting that, starting this session, the review and exam periods would be combined, with one exam every other day, still finishing in two weeks. Students can rest and recover from fatigue after the exam, which is greatly beneficial to health. During the rest period, they can also review the subjects to be tested the next day. Teachers can also grade the papers in a leisurely manner without being in a hurry, which is a win-win situation. The graduation class of this exam will be held from June 9th to 21st, and the non-graduation class from the 16th to the 28th, both for two weeks. (Wei)</p>
<h3 id="e201">Changes in Important Officials of Jiaotong University <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Jiaotong University, recently, the Ministry has ordered changes in important officials in many cases. The following is a record for the reference of those who care about Jiaotong University:</p>
<p>(1) Dean of the College of Civil Engineering: The dean of the College of Civil Engineering of the school was originally Mr. Sun Mou. Now, Mr. Sun has been ordered to be transferred to the position of Director of the Industrial Department of the Ministry of Railways, and has been specially sent to Belgium to inspect and negotiate the purchase of materials for the Longhai Railway. He will have to go abroad with Mr. Ling Hongxun, Director of the Longhai Engineering Bureau, at the end of this month. Therefore, the seat of Dean of the College is taken over by Mr. Li Qianruo, who was commissioned by the Ministry. Mr. Li is the Chief Engineer of the Yangtze River Waterway Regulation Committee, and has a wealth of knowledge and experience in civil engineering. It is expected that he will have great plans and success in the development of civil engineering at Jiaotong University.</p>
<p>(2) Dean of the College of Mechanical Engineering: Mr. Wang Shenshan, Dean of the College of Mechanical Engineering of the school, has been ordered to go to Germany to participate in the Universal Industrial Conference and the Power Conference, and has already set off. The Ministry of Railways has appointed Section Chief Zhu Baofen to temporarily act as dean. Mr. Zhu has already arrived at the school to take up his duties.</p>
<p>(3) Registrar: Mr. Chen Yuanzhen, the Registrar of the school, graduated from Peking University and has made considerable efforts in the Kuomintang and is deeply trusted by the Central Party Headquarters. Since taking office as Registrar of Jiaotong University, he has been even more serious and meticulous in his work, and President Sun Ke trusts him even more. This time, there is a lack of guidance for party affairs in North America and Canada, so Sun Ke suggested that he be sent to Canada to reorganize party affairs and also serve as the chief writer of the Canada Republic Daily. As for the seat of Registrar, the school believes that the semester will end soon, and it is extremely difficult to find personnel in this short period of time, so they discussed with Dean of Student Affairs Chen Jiaxun, who will temporarily take over.</p>
<p>This is in terms of the Shanghai headquarters. It is heard that Mr. Li Houshen, President of the Tangshan branch, will be re-appointed to an important position by the Ministry of Railways, and the position of president will be given to Dr. Zheng Fuhua. (Wei)</p>

<h3 id="e202">The Future of Black Americans <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Black Americans have historically been oppressed by white Americans. It was not until Lincoln emancipated the slaves that they gained formal freedom. However, the discrimination against blacks in the southern states is still very obvious, and atrocities are often heard of. It was not until recent years, due to the struggles of the blacks themselves, that the situation has gradually improved. The London Observer recently published a dispatch from Alabama (the state in the southern United States where black education is most developed), which recorded the talk given by Dr. Morton, the president of Tuskegee University in Tuskegee, a famous black educator, during Black History Week. He described in detail the current situation and future of blacks in various parts of the United States, and there are many points worth noting. The following is a summary:</p>
<p>The future of blacks in the United States, although there are many difficulties and misfortunes, is generally very optimistic. It can even be said that there has never been such hope as there is today. Although black Americans, especially in the South, are still often discriminated against or deprived of their right to vote, most of this is due to the blacks themselves disregarding their rights, which cannot be entirely blamed on the authorities. Even white Americans in the southern states are prone to abandoning their rights.</p>
<p>As for black education, the tuition fees donated by various parties are now more than ever. It must be known that the southern states have only recently believed that education should be popularized. Decades ago, even poor white children did not have the right to enjoy education, let alone blacks. Now, the number of black schools is gradually increasing, and the number of blacks receiving education is also increasing rapidly. After graduating, many are able to engage in various professional occupations, not falling behind the whites. Generally speaking, the North has more doctors, lawyers, scientists, writers, and artists, while the South has more businessmen. Now, the National Black Businessmen's Association has more and more members and is making more and more progress in its affairs. I am honored to be the president of the association and know many people with great vision and extraordinary knowledge. Blacks are mostly engaged in banking, insurance, and manufacturing. Even women are quite talented, such as Mrs. Walker, who is the president of a large bank in Richmond, Virginia.</p>
<p>Blacks are also willing to study and make progress in farming. The late Mr. Chamberliss is one example. After Mr. Chamberliss' death, he bequeathed most of his property to build a school and a kindergarten in Tuskegee to educate many colored children in the city, which is of no small benefit to his people.</p>
<p>The cooperative movement is gradually gaining influence among blacks, which is also very promising. Now, there are black store associations in various places, which reduce the burden of independence and improve the quality of goods to attract broader business. Blacks who open stores are mostly known for their kindness to customers. White stores in the new southern provinces also hire blacks as managers.</p>
<p>Some people are overly concerned that the increase in the number of blacks and the opening of their minds will intensify competition for jobs between blacks and whites, or even lead to major conflicts. I believe that there is no such danger in the upper classes, but in the lower classes, such as laborers, conflicts may be inevitable due to the pursuit of work, but they will not be very serious and can be ignored.</p>
<p>Incidents of white people mistreating black people have gradually decreased in recent years. According to the Tuskegee survey report, there were only 10 such incidents in 1929, one less than in 1928 and seven less than in 1925. After the incidents occur, white public opinion also pays great attention to them, unlike in the past when they were indifferent.</p>
<p>The number of blacks who are pastors has gradually decreased in recent years. It is now estimated that there is one pastor for every 534 blacks, while there is one pastor for every 983 whites. However, there are few who join churches, and the number of those seeking a Bachelor of Theology degree in schools has also decreased. However, blacks are more calm emotionally and more intellectually advanced.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Impressions of the People's Art Exhibition <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Art should be popularized, and life should be artistic. These are two very popular sayings, and also something everyone hopes can be realized. Using the power of the people to promote art ensures that art will endure. Using the spirit of art to transform life prevents it from becoming dull. Recently, most people have felt a sense of unease in their lives, especially the people in the city, who show signs of distress everywhere. The decline of careers and the corruption of character are secondary. If we want to improve life and promote civil spirit, advocating noble fine arts and developing mass art are, of course, essential remedies. We understand the unprecedented Shanghai Special Municipality People's Art Exhibition in this way.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, a big city, if you want to find a place that is the most popular and accessible to the people, the City God Temple is definitely one of the best. Starting with the plaque that protects the corner of the sea, it encompasses everything. Every day, thousands of men, women, old, and young, come to worship this sacred place. Originally, the scenery of Yu Garden, the Huxinting Teahouse, the Zigzag Bridge, the Cuixiu Hall, and the Jade Exquisite Stone were already good. In addition, there are tea houses, antique shops, bird shops, second-hand book stalls... all kinds of embellishments, making the unique atmosphere even stronger. This first-ever People's Art Exhibition is held in the inner garden of the City God Temple, which is probably a perfect match.</p>
<p>On the opening day of the People's Art Exhibition, it drizzled and rained incessantly. The calligraphy and paintings hung in the hall and corridors trembled listlessly in the breeze. The scroll rods lightly tapped against the walls, making a crisp and monotonous sound. The visitors walked back and forth between the calligraphy and paintings with their hands behind their backs, as if standing on both sides were many tall and lean calligraphers and painters bowing to each other. On a rainy day, in this gloomy and silent hall and corridors, the impression of seeing Chinese calligraphy and paintings with a distant artistic conception seems to be very bleak.</p>
<p>The next day, the number of visitors increased by about two times, totaling around one thousand eight hundred. The entire garden suddenly became very lively. Entering through the main gate, you first had to sign your name. Because everyone was rushing ahead, there was some disorder. Walking into the passage, you could see many Chinese paintings on both walls. Some people brought packages and sundries and had to deposit them at the cloakroom before entering the main hall to see the paintings. In the main hall, vertical scrolls, screen panels, and small paintings created an extraordinary realm. Several elderly viewers carefully looked from one painting to another, stroking their beards from time to time, nodding their heads up and down, and muttering to themselves. As for the general audience, they just slowed down their pace, passed through the hall and corridor, and then climbed up the artificial mountain. There were many children in the venue, like butterflies among flowers, running from east to west, happy and laughing.</p>
<p>Calligraphy couplets and the like were displayed in Qingxue Hall, with all styles of regular script, cursive script, clerical script, and seal script. The visitors seemed to have less interest in this section. Not only did the children not even glance at it, but even the gentlemen with long sleeves became relatively calm and serious in their expressions as soon as they entered Qingxue Hall, and their pace quickened. Therefore, it was not easy to see many people standing together in this room. Even if someone was looking at the wall, it was just like the prodigy in the book reading ten lines at a glance. After seeing the calligraphy, they went up to Yanqing Tower to see Western paintings and photography.</p>
<p>Before going up to Yanqing Tower, you had to pass through Songcui Pavilion, where many photographic works were displayed. The works were indeed very good, but there were fewer people crowding to see them than in front of the photography studio on the street. Most of the Western paintings were oil paintings. There were indeed many exquisite works, but some were inevitably immature and stiff. There were also several nude oil paintings. Several young sightseers, with their arms around each other's necks, lingered in front of a larger nude woman for a while, muttered something incomprehensible, and then left together. The Western painting exhibition hall was not very spacious, but the exhibits were very enthusiastic. The walls were full of brightly colored frames, arranged so tightly that no water could escape. At first glance when running up to Yanqing Tower, it was like running into a hardware store specializing in picture frames. The opportunity to appreciate the paintings seemed to be mostly occupied by the picture frames.</p>
<p>The inner garden is not easily opened at ordinary times. This time, due to the opportunity of the People's Exhibition, there were not a few who were able to admire the famous garden. If it could be permanently opened, it would not necessarily be a good thing for the people. However, the following section cannot be taken lightly.</p>
<p>An office worker said to the old gentleman in charge of the garden, "That white pomegranate tree next to the artificial mountain is very rare and precious. We should pay attention and not let the children climb and break it." The old gentleman was already old. After hearing this, he sighed slightly, but said excitedly, "That's why it can't be opened. Once it's open, I don't know how it will be ruined." After the old gentleman said this, he was silent, lowered his head, and took furious puffs on his dry tobacco pipe, as if the ten-day exhibition period was very long.</p>

<p>Chapter 43: Italian Literature After the Renaissance</p>
<p>In poetry, the pioneer of the new era, the most important figure in the sincere Italian dramatic literature of the eighteenth century, is Alfieri, who possesses both first-class dramatic power and a sincere style. His main materials are mostly classical, such as Greek legends and ancient history. However, the style, although somewhat based on Machiavelli, is fresh and vigorous, Alfieri's own. Alfieri's plays have never crossed the border into English literature, yet he is important as a playwright, poet, and prose writer. We should know his ode praising American independence (he was a passionate admirer of freedom and an enemy of tyrants). As far as I know, this has never been translated into English.</p>
<p>The most magnificent Italian author of the eighteenth century is Parini. His "Day" (Il Giorno) is a sharp satire. By means of the fresh use of that heroic blank verse, Parini deservedly earned the title of "Modern Italian Virgil" bestowed by Leopardi on the older poet. Although Parini had a love for the classical past, he was an independent and original figure. A less original but more subservient figure, but also with excellent talent, is Monti. His importance is largely due to the fact that he explains the relationship between literature and practical problems. He wrote poems praising Napoleon that were somewhat flattering, but his right to demand a high position in literature lies in his translation of the Iliad, which is ultimately recognized as the best Italian translation.</p>
<p>Together with Ugo Foscolo, we enter the nineteenth century both in time and in spirit. The publication of "The Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis" two years before the birth of the new century made him the Italian Goethe, although far narrower in scope than the great German. The suffering of Italy under the dual shackles of Austria and her accomplice Napoleon is reflected in this book. One might think that the literary relationship between Italy and England, two countries almost at opposite ends of Europe, is the most interesting example to be explained by Foscolo. A major essay on this relationship remains to be written. Many English poets have lived and died in Italy. At least Rossetti, an excellent English poet, is of pure Italian descent. Foscolo lived in England for many years and was a recognized and respected figure in the English critical arena. His poetry, although narrow in scope, is beautiful. His "Poems on Sepulchres" are poignant lyrical poems. His direct relationship with English literature lies in his translation of Sterne's "Sentimental Journey."</p>
<p>Thus, we move on to Leopardi, the greatest Italian genius of the nineteenth century, regarded as a sad, desolate, and world-weary poet, but also a natural singer. We can roughly regard him as the Italian Byron. He is inferior to the Italian poet in terms of vigor and productivity, but superior in terms of delicacy and completion. His magic has not been transplanted into English, and probably cannot be transplanted. The English scholar Bickersteth has written an interesting and informative book about Leopardi. However, English poems composed "in the rhythm of the original" are thousands of miles away from the Italian. Translation in this area, if not strictly following the words, is the art of recreating in the translator's language. One must be one or the other. However, even for the sake of Dante and Leopardi, it may not be impossible to acquire the knowledge of Italian sufficient to read them. This is what I dare to advise.</p>
<p>In fiction, the Romantic spirit is best represented by Manzoni. Let's make another loose, uncritical, but suggestive comparison: he is the Italian Walter Scott. His novel "The Betrothed" (I Promessi Sposi) is a first-class novel. It has entered all the languages of Europe, and although not the masterpiece that Italians seem to believe, it is still a work that is enjoyed with relish. In it, there is a kind of enchanting tenderness, and the style that Manzoni spent many years painstakingly perfecting has been helpful in maintaining Italian prose on a healthy foundation when it is in danger of soaring into empty rhetoric. He was a man endowed with all kinds of genius. His tragedies are mainly famous and praised now because he wrote them. However, his first drama "Count Carmagnola," which is independent of tradition and novel in form, also caught the eye of Goethe, a philosopher so insightful that he often discovered beauty. Manzoni is a lyrical poet of overflowing brilliance.</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>The poem he wrote when Napoleon died (Il Cinque Maggio) is known everywhere where Italian is used. In this simple literary story, at least the beautiful "Requiem" by Verdi, which is in memory of Manzoni, is worth recording, especially if we strive to discover the unity of the arts and the continuity of human expression.</p>
<p>Carducci, an Italian poet of the mid-nineteenth century, a poet who cannot be translated and have significant value, was both a poet and a critic, and compiled older Italian poets with skillful hands. He is a surprising example of a literary professor and artist. His poems are concise, rigorous, and profound. In terms of the depth of meaning and the completion of form, no modern Italian poet has surpassed him.</p>
<p>In fiction, modern Italy has several talented figures, but few of the first-class genius. The most outstanding is probably the Sicilian Verga. He is mainly known outside of Italy for his novel "Cavalleria Rusticana." That novel is the basis for Mascagni's very popular opera. However, Verga's work is greater than that romantic short story. It is a social and emotional history of Sicily and Southern Italy.</p>
<p>Regarding the existing Italians, we can only say a word or two. D'Annunzio is a poet, playwright, novelist, aviator, and politician. His versatility and energy are unbelievably like the most vigorous men of the Renaissance, no one surpassed him in strength. His wording is amazing. Probably no other Italian in any era has been the possessor of such a vast vocabulary. Perhaps there is a smell of charlatan and posturing in him, but his works have not only stirred his compatriots but have also shaken all of Europe. And certainly, the man who wrote "The Triumph of Death" and "The Flame of Life" belongs to the prince of unworthy men. His lyrical poems are full of eloquence and bordering on verbosity. His plays, although somewhat rhetorical, are tense and colorful. The story of Francesca da Rimini, which he wrote with Duse as the heroine, is the kind of sensational literature that does not often appear on modern or any stage.</p>
<p>Young Italians like Papini and Marinetti are trying bold experiments with new forms and revolutionary ideas. A magnificent writer of short stories, which is not revolutionary in structure but classically complete, is Giuseppe Enrico. One thing seems certain: tastes are changing, schools are shifting, but Italy, the land of violent romantic gestures, will remain largely faithful to its ancient ancestors and will remain a child of the classics.</p>
