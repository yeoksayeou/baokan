<p>關税部分已告解决</p>
<p>法權問題尙未談及</p>
<p>(南京)中日關税協定草約、於三月十二日在京簽字、嗣由日代使重光葵將草約送呈日政府請示、案經日樞密院於上星期内正式核准、並訓令重光葵、與我國外交部正式簽字、六日晨、我國外交部長王正廷偕日代使重光、由滬抵京、十時半重光偕商務官橫竹、書記官守屋·守島掘内林出上村岡崎等、至薩家灣外部官舍、晤見王外長及亞洲司長胡世澤科長許念琛馬長善謝家　等、我方全權王正廷、日方全權重光葵、先換閲全權證書、次校閲中日關税協定及附件中日英文正本、王發言、謂關於中日關税恊定之成立、完全由于日本方面努力與援助、甚爲感謝、將來中日進行其他條約時、仍希望日本方面予以同樣之援助云云、嗣重光亦照例答詞、十時五十五分、正式簽字、計協定正文五條、附件四件、中日英文各繕兩份、將來遇有條文解釋有疑義時、以英交爲準、簽字畢、王外長即在官舍宴重光等、痛飮正宗酒、至下午二時、重光始返日領館定七日晚返滬王外長語記者、中日修約中之關税部分、業已解决、即將進行續議法權問題、但因日代使重光葵此次來京、祗奉命簽關税協定、對我國法權提案、尙未奉到該國政府覆訓、故今明日尙不能即談不權提案、惟深信中日關稅協定签字後、中日新商約即不難訂成、</p>
<p>深望中日邦交從此益敦睦誼、重光蔡語記者、中日關税已正式解决、實甚欣幸、日本方面在一九二四年北京關税會議時、即承認中國關税自主權、乃數年來因種種關係、未能實現、至爲遺憾、今正式簽關税協定、實貫澈中國多年之夙望、但望中國　確切實行協定各條欵云、聞重光定六日晚宴請楊樹莊陳紹寛及海部人員、七日午宴英美義等國公使及駐京各國領事藉資聨歡、（六日專這）</p>

<p>印度之民族運動。醖釀至一九一九年。而始發現劇烈之革命。亦至一九一九年。而印度之革命。始由甘地爲大規模之領導。在甘地領導之初。即倡不合作不暴動之主張。欲以最温和之手段。獲達最寳貴之目的。然而事機發動之後。參加者旣不一派。相逼者又非如吾所意料。故其演進。往往漸激烈漸紛雜。而不能由吾指揮。亦無能力可以收拾。結果終爲武力所乘而至於失敗。此甘地領導革命中所已經過者也。此次甘地之非武力抵抗。即欲貫澈其前次不合作不暴動之主張故其實行之初即已預防以前之弊再三審愼而出之然而觀其演進之結果。仍將不免於失望。再以英國方面言。英睡府對付印度革命之手段。初亦未嘗不用温和而避激烈。更未嘗不稍稍讓步以敷衍之。然而敷衍决不能滿印人之願。敷衍之手段窮。於是不能不用最後之一手段矣。</p>
<p>由是可知世界萬事之爭。苟皆認爲有關於切膚利害。而各不肯讓步者。必無調和之善法。當其初雖皆不欲用最後之一手段。然其他種種和平方法用盡以後。勢不能不用此一手段。但此最後之手段。果能解决此相爭之問題乎。則又恐無論何人不能懸斷。即以印度問題論。用武力不止一次。然用一次武力。徒多一次犧牲。結果非特不能解决問題。且增失敗方面之怨懟。而預伏一次暴發之根。是故人但知武力之爲危險而不輕用。非眞有所覺悟也。能知武力之不足以解决萬事之爭。平心靜氣以求所以至公無私之道。斯眞謂之新覺悟。此次甘地之被捕。去用武力愈近一步而去解决則愈遠矣。</p>

<p>積極擴張長江航業</p>
<p>長江航業之淡、至近時可謂達於極度矣、來去之貨、均皆缺乏、因營業之不振、而各公司乃有各謀補救之計、如下水運費之减跌强速率快輪之添造、均所以互欲取得優勢也、在此生意淸淡之際、而中外各航、乃有基本上改革求善之進行、未雨綢繆正爲營業競爭之要著亦足以見洋商對長江航路之處心積慮、極全力以經營之也、茲將中外輪之互相擴爭狀况、分别記述如後、</p>
<p>招商發展業務招商局長江八船、久未能全部復行、今次由總部命令、將建國·江新·等放回以後、長江一路．已决定開駛六艘、而四大江輪（即江順江安江華江新）之一四正班、自本月分起、已可派準開行、日來由營業科規則定妥、每一個月至少可行十六次、五月分内已派如上之次數、俟江裕輪還滬、更可增至月行十九次、平均每船貨客脚往來以五千兩計則長江一路之月入當在十萬元以上、此爲去年四月以後該局之長江班輪爲最多的一月也、船期能準確則營業自可起色也、</p>
<p>中外競爭客脚長江船搭客營業、自公票局解散後、各外輪多將售票權收歸自管、中國江輪、雖仍由業務主任包認但頭等客票、亦歸局中所有、前月洋商各江輪、擬主張乘此金漲潮流、增加票價當時已經擬定、乃於徵求華輪同意時、而爲各華商所反對、致加價事、即無形取消、茲聞招商局爲擴張客脚營業、已將長江下水客票、與中國旅行社訂立代售合同、以冀盡量發展、</p>
<p>英商急造新船近年來航業界盛行快船化、凡速率大、行駛快、而可以行到目的地者、則營業必佳、本埠英商太古公司已在建造此項油機快輪兩艘、用以加入揚子江内行駛、在上游之蕪湖號一艘、不久可來滬開班、在滬漢班之一艘、亦在建築中矣、每小時速率、均可行十四海里之上而怡和洋行、亦在本埠某船塢建造速快輪一艘、用摩托引擎聞工程將完、而船名已擬定、似爲升和號係預備競爭該路營業之所用者、本年均可行駛也在各該新船落成之日、即爲長江航輪競爭之開始云、</p>
<p>上游外輪全開上江外輪、自三月二十日起罷航、以抵制領江增薪當時輟業之船、有二十八艘、嗣後捷江與日淸兩公司、首先單獨允加工薪日美江輪在四月二十日、已先由滬開往重慶復班、而英商怡和船、亦皆赴宜守待復航、至於太古公司在宜　一路内、共有八輪行駛、在停駛之後多半開回上海、茲已接到宜昌電報、謂增薪條件已經談妥、領江人員、亦皆上船．故在滬之萬縣·萬通·萬流等船、刻均奉到開船命令、各就本埠運載大批棉紗直放重慶、在十一號以前、可以全數上駛矣、自今日起、重慶一路、有三十九輪行駛、華商船祗占八艘也、</p>

<p>一九二一年五七、八八八·一一九</p>
<p>用銀增加自一九三○年歲以來、中國與印度二國用銀之數量更有增、加自演繹定則上言之、銀價之低落非特不當有若是之甚、且應上漲焉、至於大條銀價格確爲倫敦紐約市塲少數公司所訂公布者、依照倫敦銀價、而計算上海事論上之匯兑平價、上文已有陳述、因此上海銀兩與倫敦大條銀間之關係、多數人遂錯認上海銀匯之上落、即依倫敦大條銀價之伸縮也、</p>
<p>（三）國際匯兑平價計算之意義</p>
<p>金鎊與銀兩於此我人最當注意者、即在兩任何國家間、以甲國之通貨、計算乙國通貨之價値時、其計算方法、即係比較兩幣制中所含純金或純銀之重量、例如英美二國之間、英鎊平價之所以値美金四、八六六五元者、祗因美金一元包含純金二三·二二格蘭而英金一鎊、則含純金一一一·○○六格蘭也、然此種平價絶非標明英鎊或美金匯價上落之原因、上海銀兩與倫敦大條銀間之關係、其性質一如上述、換言之、其公式上或不動數之關係、乃屬一種計算方法、由此方法、我人以已知之倫敦銀價、用先令與便士、而計算上海銀兩之價格、並非謂倫敦銀價以此决定上海銀價、何者、决定上海銀價（及倫敦大條銀價）容於下文伸説、</p>
<p>（丙）金貴銀賤之眞相</p>
<p>本問題發生以來、患在多爲空論、實際最緊要者、在明瞭銀匯上落之眞正原因、旣已明瞭其眞相、乃能進而謀補救、問題旣屬複雜、學者切不可被情感或成見所左右、須處之以鎭靜、並以科學分析、究察其狀態、始可窺其全豹、</p>
<p>（一）金融風潮之發軔、先請就銀匯恐慌初起時之狀况、回溯述之標金價格在去年即已逐步上漲、迨本年一月七日已漲至四百七十六兩之巨、當時投機界銀行界商業界以及其他有關各界、已呈不安之象、然尙無若何巨大紛擾、直至一月八日、金價由四百七十六兩、一躍而爲四百九十六兩、於是上海標金交易史上之活劇、遂於時開始、投機失敗者痛定之餘、更將標金操縱之隱秘、力事宣佈而反對投機、以及維持銀匯之紛擾、亦於時沸騰設使當時（一月八日）標金價格無此頃刻飛漲、則本埠金融紛擾似句遲遲其來、或者竟可無期限的遲延也</p>
<p>（二）國際償付定則原理之適用</p>
<p>標金與銀匯本問題關鍵之所在、即銀匯係標金價格反映之一點顧國際匯兑原理、原屬一種極艱難而專門之學理、但上海銀匯之狀態、其繁複倍甚依照單純的滙兑原理而論、上海銀匯、應依國際償付定則而生變動、與兩金用國間之國際償付、在尋常狀態下情形相同、惟在前者情形之下、就抽象理論而言、生銀爲一種物品、其金値似亦可以影響上海銀滙、國際償付定則之適用於本問題、理至淺顯無庸證實、扼要言之、則當我國應付外國之時、銀　轉逆、反之、當我國應收外國之時、銀匯轉順、除此國際償付順逆爲一主要原因外、尙有其也更較有力之原因、影響及於銀滙、即久經忽視之標金投機及東匯是也、</p>
<p>（三）東滙影響銀匯之勢力、先請考察東滙一原因、數年來、東滙常因標金投機之關係、對於我國銀滙上特有覇佔之勢力、凡爲銀滙而作之標金投機、與其對景銀滙之投機、大部均惟東滙之馬首是瞻、當東滙上漲之時、即爲標金之上漲及銀滙之下跌、反之、亦然、標金之上落雖亦能反響及於東滙、然其勢力一與東滙之影響於標金者相較、則又微不足道、上述之現象在中國、已歷有年所、故吾人最合理之結論即爲上海銀滙、係受東滙之節制、而非受倫敦大銀條價之節制也、（未完）</p>
<p>來函</p>
<p>逕啟者、今見貴報本埠新聞内有江北人李明良在成都路一千零五十八號組織盜黨機關云云、查該號門牌係敝常事人義源廠之房屋、前遭盜刦、後由捕房查有小工李明良主使因此捕去解究在案、恐與義源廠名譽有關特此函請更正、無任盼企之至、　頌撰安律師巢堃、五月</p>

<p>現代的女子。未到二十歲。就　　　把戀愛的精華吃盡了。所以一到盛年之後、覺得生活枯澀哩。</p>
<p>差不多每個男子。可以告訴你如何如可娶了一個女子做他的妻子。可是没有人能夠解釋爲什麽他要娶伊。</p>
<p>不要聽見了一個女子在電話中的柔聲，就斷定了伊的性質和面貌也不要在一個男子吃了一杯冰酒以後。斷定了他的品性。</p>
<p>道德在從前是一個地理的問題。在現在却是一個時間的問題了。從前之所謂罪惡。到現在可以稱爲漂亮。現在所視爲可怕的事。將來或者是一件極時髦的舉動。</p>
<p>女人們多歡喜回想過去的戀愛。過去的夢境。而男子們則喜於猜想未來的快樂。未來的夢境。</p>

<p>崑山顧亭林先生學識淹博。所著日　　　知錄一書。尤爲我國學術界之偉大結晶。先生逝世。迄今凡三百年。顧遺澤在人。盛名未嘗稍替。一昨吾友某君。爲予述及先生之鞋。其事雖微。頗饒興趣。因摭記以實本談。</p>
<p>墓之歷史亭林先生故鄕爲崑山之茜墩。山水傍依。地極幽秀。先生没於贛。未嘗歸葬故里。其子孫輩乃以先生之衣冠入殮。擇地營葬。淸宣統間。太子師傅梁鼎芬至茜謁公墓。加以修葺。並築四柿亭于墓側。蓋公昔日故居。庭植四柿。故名以紀念也。淸末民國以後。整理無人。墓及祠均就圮矣。</p>
<p>鞋之形式公有遺鞋一。迄今仍存於其故家。鞋長尺餘。面呈灰黯色。底已破損。口頗狹。上積塵垢甚多。據歷史上之推測。此物决非　鼎。而古色斑爛。尤異於常物。除此而外。尙另有大小相若之紅綢鞋一。兩共置於一玻璃匣中。</p>
<p>遺鞋之傳説遺物不足奇。所可異者。乃獨遺一鞋耳、據一般人傳説。則謂公殁於贛時。特將此鞋寄歸以示其子孫者。又一説則謂公急於出外而遺落於家中者。二説自以前説爲可信。然考據無從。眞相亦不得而知矣。</p>

<p>比歲以來。匪氛大熾。各地居民。寢饋　　　不安。即吾鄕小鎭。（松邑泗涇）。至上月二十八日。已遭二次大帮匪徒搶刦。詳情已載各報地方新聞。茲擇遺漏者。略述於左</p>
<p>喬裝小販當未行刦前之三四日。匪徒已混入泗涇。即喬裝販賣「絲棉被·洋線襪·花洋布·及小兒糖果食物」等等在大街小巷中喊賣。暗中則探聽鎭上之當舖及富翁住宅。至二十八日下午三時許。鎭西突來匪船十餘艘停泊。匪衆即登陸整隊。先以</p>
<p>鳴槍示威爲預伏之匪響應暗號。前導者一匪。手執紅色大綢旗一面。上書（天下第一軍毛）字樣。由西市梢向東而行。時即被在西大橋上之保衛團員瞥見。即發一槍。當將執旗者擊斃。第二匪即上前執旗。團員復發一槍第二者亦倒地。第三者奔上。團員繼發一槍亦中。匪衆見執旗者連倒三人。乃大隊蜂擁至保衛團圖刦。團員見大隊追來。急回團部報告。時各團員在後門建築泥墻。聞報即各携槍械出後門。匪徒亦已追進。即</p>
<p>雙方開戰且戰且退。至鎭後公共體育塲相近。激戰約一小時半。各團員因槍彈用罄。而預伏四處之匪衆已集。勢更猖獗。各團員祗得暫避。匪衆見保衛團不支。乃</p>
<p>入市行刦時已將五鐘約刦一小時。（所搶各店及損失已詳各報從略）。至六點鐘。匪衆仍至鎭西列隊點名、結果缺少一人。復入鎭鳴笛搜尋。遍尋不得。匪乃　　大出賞格有一匪徒手持鈔票一束。。口喊「老三·三老爺」。在街上狂奔。另一匪且行且哭。並謂「如有人將三老爺尋到。或尋着屍身者願。賞洋二百元」。後增加至五百元竟無人答應且天氣漸暗匪衆恐軍隊追至。不敢盤桓。遂急急向西北逃去。及松江軍隊到泗。匪已遠颺矣。</p>
<p>事後趣聞本月六日，爲松邑佘山天主敎徒舉行迎聖母禮。故邇日各地士女往游佘山者日多。一日爲世界勞工紀念放假。余同事十餘人。是日乘假期亦往佘山游玩。道經泗涇。在東市梢登岸。上街　覽。時鎭中人見十餘人均不認識。加之口音各異。於是紛紛議論。婦女見之者謂。「一羣陌生人。不知到泗何事」。蓋距盜刦祇隔二三日。一見生人。心已恐慌。誠亦驚弓之鳥也。</p>
<p>今次之遭刦。蓋邇來蘇浙省當局在太湖方面聨合兜剿。各匪乃東逃西竄。擇無駐軍之鄕鎭肆行搶刦。余願各縣當道。亦宜聨合會剿。如甲縣有盜警。乙縣聞報。須協力兜拿。互相聨絡。如此則匪衆不得逞。且易於殲滅。商民亦可安心經營。今泗涇之不遭糜爛者。均係保衛團之力。團員祇三四十人。而能敵盜匪百餘。誠非易易也。</p>

<p>中次各米一律續疲</p>
<p>閘北昨日内地到申米船寥寥數號、但河下存積極充、故市销仍不開展、北帮頂白粳因產銷兩處均告枯薄貨主以成本關係行情頗挺、而中次等粳底貨旣厚、銷又呆懈、祗新到之上中粳略形活動、其餘交易頗淸故價格步短、薄稻到頭不旺、去胃亦淡趨勢續疲、但眞特頂貨須在十九元關外、羊秈穩定、杜尖隨洋米而轉移、走銷因貨稀故、買户殊不注意、大盤尙鮮變化、至於白元則高俏次滯、市呈提高抑次人勢、全日成交亦極淸淡也、</p>

<p>當一個推銷員有了二三百個主顧時。可以分爲兩種觀察。可以作爲一件煩悶的厭物着。也可以作爲一個金鑛看。金鑛而開採得法。自然有狠好的報酬。否則結果當然是不會好的。譬如説有三百個顧客。就有三百輛汽車。要每月來替他們服務。或是滑潤。或是洗刷。或是換胎易電池。工作便十分緊張了。</p>
<p>三百個主顧中。有一部分是容易將服務期忘却的。所以推銷員就應當想方法來通知他們。引起他們的注意。成功或失敗。關鍵就在此處了。從經濟看來。爲服務敏捷起見。有幾種新的科學方法。是値得介紹的。</p>
<p>（一）備忘單備忘單是最新式的。採用的地方已狠多了。方法是將一個印好的單子。黏在汽車的速表上面。上面將各項的規定。如走幾里路要加油。走幾天要洗等等常識。寫得狠淸楚。如此車主在關車時。便可隨時警覺不致遺忘。這種備忘單價錢極廉妙處就在這點。而且功用偉大。不過有許多車主。不喜將車上黏貼紙張。但現在備忘單印得極爲美觀。車主正可作爲裝璜之一種。如果實在不肯時。黏在下面也可以。</p>
<p>明信片第二個廉價方法。便是明信片。等到某事主修理的期限到時。便可以以明片去通知他。他看了明片當然會來的。有些人主張由推銷員自印一種特種的明信片。務必要特别。否則混清不清。</p>
<p>反爲不妙。這話的確不錯最好印些彩色的。如此一來。更有意味了。現在也有用自動機管理照片的。譬如某事在那天要修理。便在那天做個記號。到了那天。自然會落下來。就可馬上付郵不致忘却了。（三）信札信札較明信片要貴些。印工紙張。要二分一封。每月三百封。就是六元。加上郵票。更是可驚。不過。信札也有一件好處。便是比較明片正式些。易爲人所重視。效力也偉大。雖然價錢大。但是以收穫而論。寫信也値得的。</p>
<p>（四）電話電話又進一層了。和主顧直接通電。更較寫信爲直接。當一個人收到一封信時。他可以塞進袋裹。或竟棄去。也許着過之後。因事忙而忘却了。這是常有的事。現在各他直接通話。他自然要特别注意。遺忘的程度。自然也少得多啦。况且有電話的顧客。比較要富有些。並可趁此而做别項交易。不過。電話的唯一難關。便是成本過大。電話費有些照月算。有些照次數算。如照次數算。更加担負重。可是如果所得的效果偉大時。這點小費。自然不成問題的。電話不但可以增進貿易。並且可以輔助明片之不足。萬一收不到或是收到而忘却時。可以由電話催促。兩次的印象更深了。决不會再忘了。電話照次數算。在生意淸淡時。也很合算。照月算。生意忙碌時。自然不成問題。現在不要問電話的貴不貴。祇要向工作有没有效率。如查有效率。電話費是不生問題的。</p>
<p>總之一個推銷員車了賣出之後。還要講究服務。要服務。便要時時留心顧客的需要時期。到了期。便得要通知他。一來維持自已的營業。免爲他人所奪。二來也是對顧客的一種好感。要維持這種營業。上面所説的四種方法都很新欵可取。因爲要顧客自已上門。比較是難些。用　忘使顧客自已注意。用明信片信函電話來催促顧客注意。所以前者係自動。後者是被動的。最後是雙方並進。那麽收效更宏。末了。我可以説事情是在人做的。當他是金鑛。自然可獲利。當他是厭物。失敗是無疑義的。用以上方法外。一個人還要有耐心。有毅力。能如此。成功是不成問題的一回事。</p>

<p>崎嶇拔涉無異平地</p>
<p>最近有秘魯人二及智利人二。作汽車之旅行。凡所經過。咸爲前此所未有。渠等於九月十六日早晨。由智利之散地牙哥地方出發。以裝有費斯克胎輪之派卡車印人所居住。開山作路。巨石岣嶙。舉目荒凉。一片不毛而已。</p>
<p>其所謂道路者。實係交又如牙之岩石。輪胎行經其上。其災難免。輪胎製造之時。初未獲得斯種之試騐。以定其需要。而費斯克車輪。自經此可驚異之試騐後。益足證明其輪胎製造之經騐。名實相符。車行所經之斜度由四十度直至五十度。昇高之時自水平線至七千尺不等。至於洞岩高低。怪石嶮巇。則全途咸是。不計於内。某次渠等所駕駛之汽車。忽然深陷於泥潭之中。後用牛車兩輛曳之而起。始告出險。又有一次。因起重機。不勝全車之重　　上圖爲中國汽車公司經理佛里門君。與華經理周夢賢君合影。周君英年碩學。作事敏捷。性情和藹。交游廣闊。政商各界要人。無不樂與周旋。服務該公司。已十有三年。公司營業之得以蒸蒸日上者。周君與有人力焉。</p>
<p>代步。經由安第斯山區之中心。而達秘魯之力姆城。時爲十月十七日。此行之冒險及幻想中意外之遭遇。實屬突過一切。其人類之忍耐力屬於乘客。汽車之持久力屬於機械。而物質上之經久則屬於輪胎。</p>
<p>明顯殆無疑義。</p>
<p>全部行程。崎嶇不平。幾於寸步難行。有深谷。有山峰。有絶壁。最深者竟在一萬尺左右。氣候又極懸殊。相差自冰點起至法氏表百度不等。而一行四人卒能履險如夷。逃過難關。亦云險矣。無論何人。祇將此數位駕車人所經過之險狀略加揣想即賞爲之昨舌。行程所經之路途大都爲量。下落於駁船上。當其由上下墜時。汽車之右前輪正着於駁船之舷。全車重量盡壓於車輪之上。而此車輪胎並不爆裂。結果則車身翻頂而已。</p>
<p>全程之最感困難者。厥推經過亞他馬加沙漠之一段。此沙漠不啻南美之薩哈拉也。七百基羅密達行程中。水源斷絶。人類或機械上苟有失措之處。無從呼援。渠等經過此熱沸之沙地。如在天然　爐之中。可怕之熱地太陽令人渴熱交併。完全</p>
<p>絶望。汽車如若損壞。輪胎或告破落。則生命之危險意中事耳。</p>
<p>凡茲所述及其他種種之困難。可以表而</p>

<p>滬太長途汽車路。自上海閘北之大統路起。迄太倉縣之瀏河鎭爲止。中經大埸。羅店。劉行等處。長七十餘華里。創辦迄今。已及十載。當伊始之初。旅客寥少。營業不振。幾致停止者數次。幸賴該公司諸創辦人努力維持。慘淡經營。積多年之苦心擘劃。始有今日佳好之成績。而今日該路之一　　　及　　。亦可爲各省長途汽車之模範矣。</p>

<p>距今尙未久遠。上海各報揭載江灣路上顚覆汽車壓斃賣票員及搭客受傷事。是則汽車搭客安全問題。頗有討論商兑之價値。欲求搭客之安全。固當先使司機者得有相當之訓練。司機者技術不精。往往易於肇禍。即以最近某君碾死某醫生證之。可以知之矣。然而汽車顚覆之不幸。其責任不能專放於司機者之身上。何以故。請略爲論列之。</p>
<p>汽車構造上之優劣。大有影響於汽車行駛方面之安全。據美國汽車業專家懷特（PercivalWhite)之見地。則汽車重心點與汽車之顚覆有關係。一般人都以爲雙層汽車。比較單層汽車易於顚覆。其間殆不盡然。蓋汽車不問單層抑爲雙層。其行駛速率。不宜超越最高之限度。否則汽車之重心點。末由减低。而顚覆之不幸·於焉發生矣。又據　特氏之見地汽車　　機不可不靈活。制動機者。停止行　之便門也。頗於許多汽車。尤其是公共汽車。因爲給價上之欠周詳。輒致内部各種機紐不能十分靈活嘗問餘杭汽車路上。曾演不少次數之顚覆。其故由於遇着轉彎曲折時。未克任意制動。而未克任意制動。則又多因於制動機二欠靈　。五於懷特氏謂汽車顚覆之不孝。　於　　時弧綫不能减短。此則亦有關係道路方面。不專屬於汽車搆造上之責任矣。</p>
<p>又查汽車顚覆之事。以出於招客(俗稱野鷄汽車)汽車爲較多。此則緣於彼等之汽車。類多破舊。或者。取締破舊汽車。亦爲市政中應注意辦理之一項歟。</p>

<h3 id="e22">Sino-Japanese Agreement <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Formally signed yesterday</p>
<p>Tariff issues resolved</p>
<p>Legal rights issues not yet discussed</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The draft Sino-Japanese tariff agreement was signed in Beijing on March 12th. Subsequently, the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires, Mamoru Shigemitsu, sent the draft agreement to the Japanese government for instructions. The case was formally approved by the Japanese Privy Council last week and instructed Shigemitsu to formally sign it with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On the morning of the 6th, the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wang Zhengting, and the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires, Shigemitsu, arrived in Beijing from Shanghai. At 10:30 AM, Shigemitsu, accompanied by Commercial Officer Yokotake, Secretaries Moriya, Mori, Horinouchi, Kami, Okazaki, etc., went to the foreign ministerial residence in Sajiawan to meet Foreign Minister Wang and Asian Department Director Hu Shize, Section Chief Xu Nianchen, Ma Changshan, Xie Jiaxun, etc. Wang Zhengting, with full powers on the Chinese side, and Shigemitsu, with full powers on the Japanese side, first exchanged their credentials, then proofread the Chinese and Japanese original texts of the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement and its annexes. Wang spoke, saying that the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement was entirely due to the efforts and assistance of the Japanese side, for which he was very grateful. He also hoped that the Japanese side would provide the same assistance when China and Japan conduct other treaties in the future. Subsequently, Shigemitsu also gave a customary reply. At 10:55 AM, the agreement was formally signed, consisting of five articles in the main text and four annexes. Two copies each were prepared in Chinese, Japanese, and English. In case of doubt regarding the interpretation of the articles in the future, the English text shall prevail. After the signing, Foreign Minister Wang hosted a banquet for Shigemitsu and others at the official residence, drinking authentic wine until 2:00 PM in the afternoon, when Shigemitsu returned to the Japanese consulate. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the evening of the 7th. Foreign Minister Wang told reporters that the tariff portion of the Sino-Japanese treaty revision has been resolved and that the issue of legal rights will be discussed next. However, since the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires, Shigemitsu, came to Beijing this time under orders to sign the tariff agreement only, he has not yet received a reply from his government regarding China's legal rights proposal. Therefore, it is not possible to discuss the rights proposal today or tomorrow. However, he is deeply convinced that after the signing of the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement, a new Sino-Japanese commercial treaty should not be difficult to conclude.</p>
<p>He deeply hopes that Sino-Japanese relations will be further strengthened from now on. Shigemitsu told reporters that he was very pleased that Sino-Japanese tariffs had been formally resolved. The Japanese side recognized China's tariff autonomy at the Beijing Tariff Conference in 1924, but it was regrettable that it could not be realized for many years due to various reasons. Today, the formal signing of the tariff agreement fulfills China's long-cherished wish. However, he hopes that China will implement the various articles of the agreement conscientiously. It is reported that Shigemitsu is scheduled to host a banquet for Yang Shuzhuang, Chen Shaokuan, and naval personnel on the evening of the 6th, and a luncheon for the British, American, Italian, and other ambassadors and consuls stationed in Beijing on the 7th to promote friendship.

<p>(Beiping) Yan took a car back to Shanxi last night. Military affairs are fully managed by Feng.

<p>(Beiping) Yan and Feng waited in Zhengzhou for the arrival of the division commanders of each army to give separate instructions. Officers above the rank of battalion commander on the two sides requested that Yan review and instruct the troops. Yan declined due to health reasons and was seen by Xu Yongchang and Liu Ji. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e24">Zhu Hexiang to the Tianjin Customs <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Negotiates for Retention of Customs Duties</p>
<p>Threatens to Send Personnel to Take Over</p>
<p>Deputy Customs Commissioner Requests Instructions</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Director of the Diplomatic Office, Zhu Hexiang, personally went to the Tianjin Customs yesterday to negotiate the issue of retaining customs duties. The Deputy Customs Commissioner said that since the Customs Commissioner was still in Hong Kong and needed to request instructions, or that only the Inspector General of Customs could hand it over. Zhu said that the Deputy Customs Commissioner was a Chinese official. If he did not hand it over, he would have to send personnel to take over. He urged the Customs Commissioner to consider the matter and reply within a few days. The Guangzhou Military Government had a precedent. Moreover, this statement was different from moving and utilizing debt funds because it declared that funds for foreign debt were stored separately and would not be lost. The Deputy Customs Commissioner agreed to telegraph the Inspector General of Customs for verification and reply.</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain financial expert said that the Tianjin Customs and Qinhuangdao sub-customs can collect 700,000 taels of foreign debt every day. Only half needs to be retained to cover expenses. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a certain official in the Diplomatic Office, the seizure of Tianjin Customs duties is inevitable. Last year, the total national customs revenue was 250 million, and less than 100 million was used to repay foreign debt. According to this calculation, only one-tenth of the Tianjin customs duties needs to be stored for foreign debt compensation. (6th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Jin faction's plan to seize the Tianjin Customs has been thwarted by the opposition of foreign customs officials. The Shanxi authorities, who have already started, plan to dismiss the current customs commissioner and replace him with a foreigner loyal to the Jin faction. This is currently underway. The Shanxi side's reason is that China has the freedom to appoint and dismiss customs officials today, when it has declared tariff autonomy, and that it does not affect foreigners in the slightest if the five-percent tax used to guarantee domestic and foreign debt is not touched.

<h3 id="e31">India After Gandhi's Arrest <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The national movement in India brewed until 1919, and began to erupt violently. It was also in 1919 that India's revolution began to be led on a large scale by Gandhi. At the beginning of his leadership, Gandhi advocated non-cooperation and non-violence, wanting to achieve the most valuable goals by the most moderate means. However, after the movement was launched, the participants were not of one mind, and those who pressured us were not as we expected. Therefore, its evolution often became increasingly intense and chaotic, and could not be directed by us, nor was there any ability to contain it. As a result, it was ultimately taken advantage of by military force and led to failure. This is what Gandhi has already experienced in leading the revolution. This time, Gandhi's non-violent resistance was intended to implement his previous advocacy of non-cooperation and non-violence. Therefore, it had already taken precautions against previous ills and was launched only after repeated careful consideration. However, judging from the results of its evolution, disappointment will still be unavoidable. From the British side, the British government's means of dealing with the Indian revolution have never been without moderation and avoidance of intensity, and it has never failed to make slight concessions to perfunctorily deal with it. However, perfunctoriness can never satisfy the wishes of the Indians. The means of perfunctoriness are exhausted, and therefore it is impossible not to use the last resort.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that in all struggles in the world, if they are all regarded as related to vital interests and no one is willing to make concessions, there will be no good way to reconcile. Although at the beginning everyone does not want to use the last resort, after all other peaceful methods have been exhausted, it is inevitable that this means will be used. But can this last resort really solve the problem of this struggle? Then it is feared that no one can make a firm judgment. Taking the Indian problem as an example, military force has been used more than once. However, each use of military force only adds to the sacrifice. As a result, not only can the problem not be solved, but also the resentment of the defeated side is increased, and the root of another outburst is laid. Therefore, people only know the danger of military force and do not use it lightly, and are not truly enlightened. To be able to know that military force is not enough to solve all struggles, and to seek the way to impartiality and selflessness with a calm mind, is truly called a new enlightenment. The arrest of Gandhi this time is one step closer to the use of military force and one step further away from a solution.</p>

Chiang gave an impromptu speech, saying that the First Instructor Division was the basic army of the National Revolutionary Army, and that this campaign to suppress the rebels would be successful. Hu Hanmin then gave a speech, saying that when the party was in Guangdong, there were only a few troops such as the Whampoa Military Academy officer corps. In the end, because the party's troops all had principles, they were able to unify China. He hoped that the officers and soldiers of the division would continue to work hard in this spirit. He also said that Yan and Feng were always motivated by territory, and their minds were filled with feudal ideas. If the party's army, which has principles, launches a large-scale attack, it will definitely be able to eliminate the rebels. Song Meiling then gave a speech, saying that this campaign to suppress the rebels will definitely be victorious in the short term, and that she especially represented the women's community in wishing everyone victory. The capital's comfort delegation also provided comfort items, including a towel and a can of biscuits for each person, which were collected and distributed by Feng.

<p>Abbas to Continue the Struggle</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 5th: After Gandhi's arrest, Abbas Tyabji will now assume the responsibilities of the Director of Volunteers, in accordance with Gandhi's instructions. A congress was held in Bombay today, attended by 100,000 people. Many speakers, including the female poet Sarojini Naidu, voiced their opinions, mostly advising the audience to fight to the end without resorting to violence. The atmosphere in Karachi is very tense. All thoroughfares are guarded by British and Indian troops and police. All sports events in Calcutta were cancelled today.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th: This afternoon in the House of Commons, someone asked whether Gandhi would be prosecuted and tried. The Secretary of State for India, Wedgwood Benn, replied that the Indian government detained Gandhi according to Ordinance XXV of 1827. The government's policy is to invite Indian leaders to participate in the conference. As for previous incidents, they can be disregarded.</p>

<p>Traffic Halted, Shops Closed</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 6th: News that arrived late from Peshawar under censorship said that at dawn on Sunday, the people were suddenly alarmed to see the entire city surrounded by troops, with sentry posts stationed at all key points. The show of force by the troops was related to the arrest of several leaders of the Congress Party and the Youth Association. All traffic is currently stopped, and banks and shops are closed. No one is allowed to travel without a permit. The headquarters of the Congress Party is occupied by British troops. Before arresting people, officials issued a proclamation to the public, saying that the government does not want to punish anyone except lawbreakers.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th: A Reuters correspondent in Simla reported a bulletin issued by the Peshawar authorities, which stated that the Congress Party and the Youth Association have been trying to incite unrest in the province in recent months, and they are particularly strongly opposed to the Sada Law restricting child marriage. Therefore, the local officials decided to detain their leaders to prevent major trouble. The Deputy Superintendent of Police risked persuading the rioting crowd to disperse and did not open fire at first. Although one of the armored cars fired a pistol first, it was only for self-defense, as one British soldier was killed, an armored car was burned, and the people in the car were attacked. Therefore, an order was given to open fire. As a result, twenty rioters were killed and sixty were injured. Since April 23rd, there have been no shootings in Peshawar. However, the Congress Party and the Youth Association are still conducting revolutionary propaganda in the city and the surrounding countryside, and they are inciting border tribes to resist the government. Their actions are clearly Communist. The use of troops to search and arrest party members is solely to assist civil officials. As soon as the area is secure, they will withdraw. The government firmly believes that this revolutionary plot has now been overthrown, and the friendly relationship between the government and the people will remain as before and will not be harmed.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Irish People Sympathize with Independence <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The Recent History of Ireland is a Precedent for India</p>
<p>India May Still Have to Go Through a Hellish Era</p>
<p>The World Daily News says that an Irish gentleman (signed Erin Gcgragb) recently published a letter strongly supporting India's independence movement. He said: "The British are busy creating various reasons to make Indians lose credibility, but this is exactly the opportunity for Indians to succeed. Success does not have to be immediate but has a foundation. I believe that it must achieve final success. The British are deceiving themselves with their justifications for their intolerable actions, which are not worth a smile. You should look through modern history and know what words they used to the world when they killed, plundered, and wantonly abused the villagers and people in Ireland. However, we finally won, because the Irish people have always remembered 'Old Ireland.' It is also possible that Indians may still have to go through this hellish era, but it will come faster, and success will also be faster. One class of British people sees the preservation of India within the British Empire as their own bread problem, but these people cannot resist the superior minds of India. I dare to tell all Indians: Persevere and do not retreat. You must know that helping the British maintain their empire is a shameful thing. You should convey this message to all Indian men, women, and children to move them. If this is achieved, the British Indian Empire will be destroyed immediately. Those who suck the blood of Indians and are still regarded as friends by Indians because of their kindness will eventually be punished. I dare to say that the person who wrote this letter has lived in India for many years and is now returning to the United States to continue working for India's cause. He recalls his time in India with great pleasure and will never forget the treatment he received from good Indians. One reason for his desire for India to break free from this unholy union is that he hopes that India will unite with the countries of the Pacific in the future, so that the Pacific Ocean will become the sea route to India, transforming India's trade routes, and making the Suez Canal and all settings aimed at enslaving other races, such as Egypt, useless. If India is gone, the Suez Canal will be worthless. Forward, India! People all over the world will support you in your resistance to oppression."</p>

<p>First Training Brigade Maintains Order</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Bengbu is located on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway and has become an important town during the current situation. The local security is currently maintained by the First Training Brigade. The brigade commander, Tang Enbo, dispatches soldiers daily to patrol the city streets and intersections, and has appointed Yan Wu, battalion commander of the First Battalion of the First Regiment, to serve concurrently as the Chief of the Investigation Department of the Martial Law Command. Martial law continues as usual. On the morning of the 4th, at 10:00 AM, Brigade Commander Tang invited representatives from all sectors to hold a joint meeting at the General Chamber of Commerce to discuss the continuation of martial law. More than 40 people attended, including Zhang Renjing, representative of the 45th Division; Ji Gengliang, representative of the 2nd Cavalry Division; Lu Xu, Chief of the Municipal Public Security Bureau; Zhou Qixian, Chief of the Changhuai Waterway Public Security Bureau; and Zuo Hao, representative of the Municipal Preparatory Office. The resolutions were: (1) For the sake of facilitating security, Bengbu City will be divided into three districts: the area east of the railway, the area west of the railway, and the area north of the Huai River in Xiaobengbu. The First Training Brigade will assign troops to each district to maintain security. (2) Chen Cheng, the commander of the 11th Division, will continue to serve as the Martial Law Commander, but the First Training Brigade will be responsible for martial law affairs.

<h3 id="e95">Lifting of the Siege of Zhucheng and Juxian <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Gao Guizi Still in Juxian</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Gao Guizi's troops, who were besieged in Zhucheng and Juxian, have been placed under the command of Ma Hongkui with the approval of the central government. Ma dispatched Li Yuying to Zhucheng to oversee Gao's troops. One day, Ma came to Jinan from Tai'an by special train to discuss this matter with Chen Tiaoyuan. Liu Chuqi, the deputy division commander of Gao's troops, also accompanied Ma to Jinan to meet with Chen Tiaoyuan. Chen, believing that Gao had sincerely expressed his intentions, immediately telegraphed the central army surrounding Zhucheng to withdraw and lift the siege, and to no longer surround the city. The central army surrounding Juxian was also ordered to lift the siege. The problem of Gao Guizi's troops, which had been troubling for several months, has come to an end. The city gates have been opened since February, and the people are free to enter and exit. However, after being besieged for more than two months, the losses amounted to several million yuan, and two-thirds of the houses were destroyed by artillery fire. The affected people have publicly elected representatives to come to the province to request compensation from the provincial government. Juxian, on the other hand, suffered less damage as it was not attacked by the army. Gao Guizi himself is still in Juxian. Gao's troops are currently stationed in Qingtuosi in Yishui, as well as in Juxian and Zhucheng, numbering approximately six or seven thousand people. They will set off for Tai'an within a few days to be under the command of Ma Hongkui. (May 4)</p>

He gave a brief speech to the people as follows: "I arrived in Hankou at 10:00 AM on April 27. Commander-in-Chief Chiang returned to Hankou from the front line at 7:00 PM that afternoon. A military conference was held on the 28th, and there were very thorough and solid measures regarding the military plans for the Jinpu, Longhai, and Pinghan lines. In particular, the work on the Jinpu Line is extremely solid. The Northwest Army on the Pinghan Line is still far from the central army, and now it is only using some miscellaneous troops to make a futile effort. There is no enemy trace in the Xiangfan area. The central army is confident about the military future. In the Guangxi area, the Sixth and Eighth Route Armies have been holding a stalemate with the enemy army across the river for a long time. They are now collecting materials and preparing to cross the river. Once the Sixth and Eighth Route Armies are deployed, the Fourth Route Army will directly take Guilin. As for the bandit suppression issue, it was the biggest task for my trip to Hankou. On April 29, I met with Chairman Lu of Jiangxi and Chairman He of Hubei to discuss the bandit suppression affairs of the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. They all unanimously advocated a joint suppression by the three provinces, and a plan for bandit suppression in the three provinces has been discussed. Roughly, each of the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi will send more than one brigade as bandit suppression troops. The expenses will be shared by the three provinces, and one of the military leaders of the three provinces will be jointly recommended to the central government to be appointed as the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, in order to be solely responsible. Commander-in-Chief Chiang paid extreme attention to the bandit disasters in the three provinces. During this trip to Hankou, he specially allocated 1,500 fast-firing rifles and 800,000 rounds of ammunition to Hunan for the suppression of the bandits. He also provided sufficient assistance in weapons and ammunition to the provinces of Hubei and Jiangxi. Therefore, the bandits and communists in the three provinces will soon be dealt a heavy blow. He also said that Commander-in-Chief Chiang was satisfied with the achievements of the party and government in Hunan during his stay in Hankou, and hoped that Hunan Province would convene a meeting of provincial representatives as soon as possible to establish a formal provincial party headquarters. Chairman He of Hubei Province and the members of the Hubei Provincial Government also praised the political and party affairs of Hunan Province, and were preparing to visit Hunan in the near future. In addition, the most difficult issues in Hunan Province, such as the procurement of military rice and the recruitment of new soldiers by other provinces in Hunan, were resolved satisfactorily during this meeting with Chairman Chiang."

<h3 id="e97">Impending Renewal of Warfare in Guangxi Province <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Long Yun's Troops Advance Towards Baise</p>
<p>Guangdong Authorities Dispatch Troops to Guard Against Communists</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The situation regarding the war in Guangxi Province has remained unchanged in recent days, allowing Chen Jitang, the Eighth Route Army Commander-in-Chief, to return to Guangdong at his leisure. It is reported that the Sixth and Eighth Route Armies stationed between Wan and Gui continue to monitor the movements of the enemy across the river, preparing equipment for crossing. They await the arrival of Guizhou and Yunnan troops into Guangxi before launching a full-scale encirclement of Xun and Liu. Recent reports indicate that a contingent of Guizhou troops has reached Guangxi's western border. Long Yun of Yunnan Province has recently intensified mobilization efforts. The Sixth Route Army Headquarters sent representative He Zifang to Yunnan to coordinate military action against Guangxi. In his recent letter from Yunnan, He stated that he had been personally instructed by Yigong (Zhu Shaoliang's alias) in Wuzhou to discuss the troop deployment with Chairman Long upon his return to Yunnan, which was deeply appreciated. Specifically, the three divisions of Lu (Han), Zhu (Xu), and Zhang (Fengchun) have been ordered to depart by the end of the month. He anticipates returning to Wuzhou to report on the troop movements immediately after their departure. Local authorities have recently received a crucial telegram from Yunnan Province stating that Long Yun, following central orders, has mobilized eighteen regiments to enter Guangxi's borders, awaiting orders. On the 26th of last month, a mobilization rally was held, where various sectors of Yunnan society convened to bid farewell to the Tenth Route Army's campaign against the rebels. Long delivered an impassioned speech at the rally, emphasizing the revolutionary soldier's duty to uphold the central government, solidify the party and nation, and sacrifice all. The entire venue erupted in thunderous applause. The shipment of the eighteen regiments is expected to be completed this week, reaching Yan Yin and other locations. Based on the above telegrams, a large-scale war in Guangxi is expected soon. In Guangdong Province, the border defense along the southern route and the West River is quite solid. However, the situation along the northeastern border has become slightly unsettled recently. After fleeing from Nanxiong back to southern Jiangxi, the Zhu-Peng communist bandits exploited the weakness of the Jiangxi border defense, engaging in disruptive activities. Furthermore, the defection of Jin Handing's troops further deteriorated security in southeastern Jiangxi. Rumors suggest that the two brigade commanders of Jin's division, Wei Chu and Zhou Zhiqun, were former subordinates of Yang Ximin of the Yunnan army. There are concerns that Yang may be communicating with military leaders in the north, implying Yang's involvement in Jin's defection. Reportedly, the defected troops have infiltrated eastern Jiangxi, seemingly planning to pass through Ruijin, Huichang, and Xunwu counties before retreating into Guangdong's borders. To prevent communist incursion, Guangdong authorities have dispatched a portion of the 61st Division from Chaozhou-Meizhou, along with Zhang Zhen's Fujian troops who recently arrived, to deploy along the Jiangxi-Guangdong border. To bolster forces in the East River region, the Eighth Route Army Headquarters sent a team on the Xin Chang steamship to Shantou on the 26th of last month, which disembarked entirely on the morning of the 28th. They immediately boarded the fifth Chaozhou-Shantou train to Chaoan, deploying to various locations along the upper reaches of the Han River. The Zhu-Peng communist bandits have been quite rampant in Nankang, Daping, Xinfeng, Anyuan, Dingnan, Longnan, Xunwu, Huichang and other places in southern Jiangxi recently. Zhu De's contingent in Xinfeng also seems to be eyeing Nanxiong. Fearing insufficient defense forces, various groups in Nanxiong telegraphed the provincial authorities yesterday, requesting assistance. Military authorities are dispatching additional troops for suppression today the 30th on twenty Guangdong railway cars, expected to arrive in Nanxiong tomorrow. (May 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e98">Vigorous Relief Efforts for Rice Shortage in Anhui's Capital <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>One Approach is Lending Grain from the Ten Thousand Trillion Granary</p>
<p>Another Approach is Allocating Military Rice from Headquarters</p>
<p>The rice shortage in Anhui's capital has intensified recently. Despite various attempts to provide relief, it has not been alleviated. Previously, the Civil Food Maintenance Association allocated 800 shi of intercepted rice to various rice shops for sale, which has been gradually sold. However, as the provincial government observed that the source of rice from the surrounding rural areas had almost completely ceased after the rice shortage in the provincial capital, they dispatched personnel to Shanghai to purchase western rice, which was a slow measure to address the situation. They then decided to allocate over 10,000 shi of grain from the Ten Thousand Trillion Granary, originally intended for emergency needs in the provincial capital. Responding to requests from numerous agencies and organizations to borrow grain for relief, a temporary discussion meeting was convened on the 30th of last month to discuss solutions. The Department of Civil Affairs proposed drafting a plan to mill and sell rice from the Ten Thousand Trillion Granary, which was approved. The plan included: (1) The provincial government would entrust the United Charitable Organizations with the milling and sale of rice from the Ten Thousand Trillion Granary. (2) The price of the rice would be set at ten yuan per shi. (3) The amount of rice sold to each person would be limited to three sheng per day. (4) The United Charitable Organizations would devise the sales method and submit it to the provincial government for approval. (5) The Anqing Civil Food Maintenance Committee would be responsible for unclogging the rice supply and suppressing hoarding. The Civil Food Maintenance Association has followed these guidelines. The provincial government, noting that 2,800 shi of military rice procured by headquarters remained in Gaohebu, yet to be shipped out, planned to temporarily borrow it for immediate relief, with the intention of returning it once the Shanghai rice shipment arrived. They immediately telegraphed Secretary-General Shao in Hankou, requesting that Commander-in-Chief Jiang be notified. They subsequently received a reply from Shao stating that the Commander-in-Chief had approved the allocation, instructing them to contact the station. They promptly telegraphed the station headquarters, requesting the rice procurement committee to comply, to which they agreed. With these measures, the rice shortage issue may find some resolution.

<h3 id="e99">Quick News from Wuhu <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The educational funding for Anhui Province was explicitly stipulated by the Ministry of Finance and the University Council, that ten million yuan should be preferentially allocated from the central tax revenues remitted by Anhui Province, to maintain education. However, only 30% of the educational funds for March of the 19th year have been received recently, resulting in arrears of two hundred thousand yuan. The Anhui Provincial Educators' Association believes that the livelihoods of educators cannot be sustained, and this continued delay is dangerous. In addition to demanding funds from the provincial government, they dispatched representatives Wang Dianping, Cheng You, and Dong Zhuqun to Wuhu to collaborate with the Wuhu Educators' Association in urging the Anhui Finance Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance to release the funds. If a solution cannot be found, they will go to Beijing to petition both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Over a thousand bandits from Guangde County were previously suppressed by the Third Battalion dispatched by the Weishutuan (Garrison Regiment) under Lü Xueshu. The captured bandit leader, Yang Shikait, has been executed on the spot by order of Garrison Regiment Leader Lü. Troops were dispatched to pursue the remaining bandits who fled to Changxing, on the border between Zhejiang and Anhui.</p>
<p>Various groups convened a meeting this morning at the Ge Wu stage to commemorate the May Fifth National Humiliation Day. Over three hundred representatives attended. Government agencies and shops were closed for the day.</p>
<p>The Supervisory Committee of the Municipal Party Headquarters has requested the Provincial Party Headquarters to dismiss and punish Li Gengchang, the Wuhu Customs Superintendent, for allowing the export of rice, causing panic in the food supply and arousing public anger. At one o'clock this afternoon, a band of over twenty bandits suddenly appeared near the Guangfu Islet area of Yiji Mountain in Wuhu, attempting to rob. The local self-defense corps immediately mobilized to encircle and capture them. The bandits opened fire. The General Headquarters of the Public Security Brigade, the Garrison Regiment Headquarters, and the Public Security Bureau dispatched troops to assist in the joint attack. After an hour of intense fighting, the self-defense corps killed four bandits on the spot. The rest fled in a northwest direction. The Garrison Regiment has dispatched troops to pursue them. Huang Bao Ying, the leader of the Self-Defense Corps, was also wounded by the bandits. (May 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e100">New Situation in Fujian's Party and Political Affairs <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The New Provincial Steering Committee is About to be Established</p>
<p>Chen Peikun Temporarily Assumes the Position of Provincial Chairman</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Fujian Provincial Party Affairs Steering Committee originally consisted of nine members. Following the January 6th coup this year, Ding Chao Wu and Yang Shuzhuang went to Shanghai, Fang Zhi and Feng Siding went to Beijing, Lin Xueyuan returned to Zhangzhou, Lin Jihua resigned, and Chen Naiyuan was arrested. Only Zhan Diaoyuan and Feng Ji'an remained in the province. Recently, Zhan Diaoyuan requested leave to return to his hometown to rescue his entire family, who were captured by communists in Longyan. Feng Ji'an is being treated for lung disease at the Chaijing Hospital. As a result, the Party Headquarters is without leadership. The county Party Headquarters in southern and western Fujian, due to their different positions from the provincial authorities, established a United Association of Thirty-Two County Party Headquarters, sending representatives to Beijing to request the reorganization of the Provincial Party Headquarters, and expressing their intention to temporarily suspend acceptance of provincial orders pending reorganization. Therefore, the Fujian Provincial Party Affairs, along with politics, have been effectively stalled since the beginning of this year. In order to strengthen the organization of the Fujian Provincial Party, the Central Committee decided at its standing meeting on April 24th to recall all nine current Fujian Provincial Party Affairs Steering Committee members and appoint Zhan Diaoyuan, Feng Ji'an, Kang Shaozhou, Chen Lianfang, and Gan Yun as new Steering Committee members. Among these five, Zhan and Feng are continuing from the previous term, Kang and Chen graduated from the Central Party School and currently serve as the Party Affairs Steering Committee members in Siming County, and Gan is a graduate of the Whampoa Military Academy and currently serves as a clerk in the Central Party Headquarters. It is expected that the New Provincial Steering Committee will be established as early as mid-May or as late as late May. Since the coup, the Provincial Government has been jointly maintained by Chairman Yang Shuzhuang and Commissioners Chen Peikun, Jiang Pingfan, and Lin Jinan. The Provincial Affairs Conference has been completely suspended. Subsequently, the three commissioners, Chen, Jiang, and Lin, believing that Yang's prolonged stay in Shanghai made it difficult for him to bear the heavy responsibility, telegraphed their resignations and urged Yang to return quickly. Yang sent Jiang Zhizhuang back to Fujian to comfort and retain the commissioners, and the commissioners temporarily withdrew their resignations. Recently, the National Government sent a telegram from the Civil Service Office to the Provincial Government, stating that, upon the Chairman's instruction, Chen Peikun was appointed to temporarily represent the Chairman's duties until Yang Shuzhuang's return to Fujian. After receiving the telegram, Chen, considering the extremely thorny military and financial affairs in Fujian Province, was unwilling to shoulder this heavy responsibility and telegraphed the National Government to resign. However, as the political affairs in Fujian Province have been stalled for a long time, and the approaching Abolition Calendar Festival coincided with the tense military situation in western Fujian's campaign against the communists, it was necessary to have someone in charge. Despite Chen's firm intention to resign, it is unlikely that the National Government will approve it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the entire staff of the Department of Civil Affairs suddenly submitted their resignations to the Provincial Government yesterday, the 30th. The resignation letter is as follows: "Submitting a request for resignation: On the morning of the 30th of this month, Zhang Bao Rong, Ke Zhenfu, Wu Huaibing, Shi Jingheng, Zhan Shiting, Zhang Lianli and others, claiming to be representatives of the Army Fourth School's Fujian alumni in the opposition, came to the Department to interfere with the Department's deliberation on the Qingxiang office case of Minyongqing County. Secretary Huang Zuhan received them, but Zhang Bao Rong and others, unable to achieve their unreasonable demands, shouted, made a scene, acted disorderly, and insulted him, and falsely accused the entire Department staff to the government. With the government's credibility swept away in such a manner, it is truly impossible to maintain. We have no choice but to express our feelings and the entire staff presents this request for resignation, humbly requesting your approval." The Fujian Provincial Government is truly beset with troubles. (May 1st)</p>

<p>Reconstruction of Xiu Bridge and Inspection of Main Roads: Most of the tall bridges on the main roads of this city have been dismantled and rebuilt. The Xiuye Bridge in the western suburbs, rebuilt into a cement and steel reinforced bridge last winter, has been completed. The contractor applied for inspection. The county government appointed staff member Qian Tiansheng, along with district chief Zhong Taichi and Wu, an engineer from the Construction Bureau, to inspect the project. The engineering work was generally satisfactory. Furthermore, residents near the Xiunan and Xitang tall bridges on the opposite bank felt inconvenienced by the lack of easy access. They requested the First District Office to plan the reconstruction and add two level bridges at the eastern and western ferry crossings to alleviate the inconvenience. Although the construction costs are substantial, local residents have expressed their willingness to contribute financially. A meeting will be convened at the Public No. 9 School on the afternoon of the 11th of this month to discuss the implementation plan. Construction is expected to begin once a plan is agreed upon. The reconstruction plan for the Mingxing Bridge in the eastern suburbs is ready and the commencement of construction is near.</p>

After using explosives to blast the rocks, they saw a giant rock on top about to fall. They used bricks to prop it up. Upon hearing a cracking sound, they knew the situation was dire and tried to escape, but it was too late. Ni and his partner, Mu Lan (24 years old, from Caoxiang), were crushed to death. After the accident, only a foot of Ni's body remained, the rest was pulverized. Mu Xiulang's body was also a bloody mess, too gruesome to look at.

<p>Negotiations to Reclaim Rooms Lent to Salt Police: The rooms of the local Xiyisuo (Vocational Training Center) were borrowed by former police chief Li Tianmin from the Qian Industrial Bureau in March of the 16th year of the Republic, as a temporary measure due to his local status. No rent was charged. The lease agreement stipulated that the rooms could be vacated if needed. These rooms have now been designated for use as granaries. Repeated requests for their return have been unsuccessful. The Yicang (Charity Granary) Management Committee, due to the imminent opening of the granaries, could no longer delay, and directly consulted the Songyun Deputy Envoy, who approved the reclamation. However, the Salt Police Bureau has now demanded over five hundred yuan in compensation for repair costs. Former police chief Li, who originally handled the lease, has revealed that the repair costs were fully covered by funds allocated by the Yunfu Envoy and have already been reported, with no further relation. Therefore, the committee has replied based on this information.</p>

<p>Jailbreak Case Being Tried in Suzhou: On the night of March 26th, a group of seven inmates, including Li Chengguo, a major criminal whose execution had been approved, and Zhang Aqi, escaped from the Wuxi Detention Substation by scaling the wall. Subsequently, Liu Yinqiu, the clerk of the substation, and Jiang Hailin, one of the guards, were arrested. Furthermore, because the inmates used four bellybands to scale the wall, Meng Genyu, the former warden and current warden of Yangzhong, should not have provided the bellybands. Suspecting other circumstances, Meng was brought back from Yangzhong and jointly interrogated by the county at the Wu County District Court. After two interrogations by the Wu District Court, Meng Genyu claimed that the four bellybands were given to the inmates because Zhang Aqi and others needed to do heavy work such as washing rice and carrying water, and it was customary practice in prisons across counties. The Wu District Court deemed Meng innocent and ordered his release on bail. The remaining clerk, Liu Yinqiu, and the guard, Jiang Hailin, were put in shackles and imprisoned.</p>

<p>Continued Report on the Chengxi Fish Farming Dispute: It was previously reported that a native of Shaoxing who lives in Youchegang, Jiaxing, had a fight with villagers in Yang'an Town over fish farming. It has now been learned that a Shaoxing native, Yan, and others raised a large sum of money and formed the Taishan Fish Farming Site, setting up barriers without official permission. The nearby Yang'an town villagers removed the barriers. After receiving the news, the Shaoxing natives gathered a large number of people, armed with oars, and hired the seventh and eighth patrol boats of the water police. They dragged them ashore in Yang'an town with a coal ship, beat Zhou Fengshan, the son of the village chief. Angering the villagers, they rang the gongs to gather a crowd. Knowing that they were about to be overwhelmed, they escaped on the boats. Shen Lianqing and Shen Wuer, natives of Shaoxing, were unable to escape. They were tied up by the villagers and the two boats and two sharp knives were seized. After the villagers took revenge, they beat the two men who had been captured.</p>

<p>Bandits Led by Fang Disrupt Leping: Since Fang Zhimin established a base in Gandon, local areas have suffered immensely. Although provincial troops have repeatedly attempted to suppress them, the bandits are scattered and difficult to eliminate. In recent months, Guangxin and Dexing Wannian counties have been harassed by bandits. Around the 20th of this month, a large group of bandits led by Fang entered Mingshan, fifteen li outside the city of Leping. Mingshan is located in the coal mining area of ​​the Po Le Coal Mining Company, because the bandits were coveting the Company's police guns, they searched the mountains and could not find anything. They then arrested two company officials and looted 7,000 yuan. Fortunately, the Yue Huang Regiment stationed in Leping, upon hearing the alarm, led a team to Mingshan to pursue the bandits, who were no match for the regiment and fled. According to various reports, the bandits are still planning to gather forces for a large-scale attack on the city. People are increasingly panicked, and all shops have closed. The whole city has stepped up security. On the 26th, a Communist bandit was escorted from Wannian. He was the elder brother of bandit leader Shao Shiping, and had been sent to various places to promote Communism. He was arrested after his plot was exposed. He was beheaded at 1:00 PM that afternoon after being interrogated by the regimental headquarters. Security is still very tight today to prevent unforeseen events. Police are being sent to search for remaining party members. It is reported that the tea market in Hekou and Dexing is difficult to open due to rampant banditry. Tea merchants in Hekou are advising each other not to enter the mountains due to the presence of many bandits. Although new tea from Qimen is being picked and processed, the tea market has been greatly affected because all the merchants are stopping business and has been affected greatly.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<h3 id="e117">Letter from Wu Jinming, Chief of Fengjing Public Security Bureau <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Dear Sirs, I recently read in your newspaper on the 5th of this month in the Jia Shan news column that "Dai Fengjing Branch Chief arbitrarily dismissed the patrol leader, causing public indignation." This is not in accordance with the facts. The Yaozhuang Bridge Outpost is under the direct control of the Fengjing Branch. The patrol leader's competence is the responsibility of the Fengjing Branch Chief. This patrol leader, Cao Peng, has acted improperly since taking office. Using the county bureau as a shield, he has repeatedly defied orders from the Fengjing Branch Chief. For instance, when the Xu Daxiong (Tai Bao Ashu) bandit group came to Yaozhuang Bridge for the third time, kidnapping Yang Xiaodi’s daughter again, the patrol leader did not report it to the Branch Chief. Also, he collaborated with the Yao West Village Defense Corps to capture the bandit hideout Li Rong's aunt and seized a lot of stolen goods without notifying the Branch Chief. He instead reported directly to the County Bureau, ignoring the Branch Chief. He was ordered to investigate, but only mentioned the surname Li in the report, not the name. He repeatedly ignored warnings. A telegram was sent to County Magistrate Shen to inform Bureau Chief Gu to take action, but the County Bureau Chief protected his person, and did nothing. The Branch Chief believed that he was deliberately obstructing and becoming too big to control, so he ordered his dismissal and put him under supervision, replacing him with first-class policeman Liu Zurong as acting patrol leader, and it has already been reported to the county government. However, this patrol leader, Cao Peng, feared punishment and fled, making a false report to Bureau Chief Gu. On the 1st and 2nd of this month, he dispatched forty armed policemen, and illegally arrested third-class policeman Chen Fude and acting patrol leader Liu Zurong. On May 1st, Branch Chief went to Shanghai on official business to investigate kidnappings and requested a three-day leave. Upon returning to the bureau, he reported to County Magistrate Shen, who also expressed dissatisfaction and released and reinstated the arrested Liu as the acting patrol leader, sending Secretary Hu to instruct Bureau Chief Gu to deal with the one-sided story, in order to obscure the truth. Your newspaper upholds justice, so I am listing the facts and requesting a correction. Sincerely yours, Wu Jinming, Fengjing Branch Chief, Jia Shan County Government Public Security Bureau, May 5th.</p>

<p>Investigating the Social Education Situation in Provinces and Cities</p>
<p>Report Submission Deadline: End of May</p>
<p>In order to investigate the state of social education, the Ministry of Education has compiled national social education statistics. It previously issued forms, ordering education departments of various provinces and education bureaus of special municipalities to fill them out and submit them. In order to complete the national social education survey for the seventeenth year and to facilitate the filling and submission process, two types of statistical survey forms for social education in the seventeenth year have been specially designed (divided into Form 1 and Form 2, Form 1 being for surveying all social education facilities outside of schools, and Form 2 being for surveying various supplementary schools and public schools within the scope of social education). Along with the order, the forms will be sent to the provincial education departments and municipal education bureaus, which will be required to fill out the forms immediately upon receipt. They do not need to be forwarded to each county to avoid delays. The various social education endeavors listed in the forms, such as educational undertakings, if the provincial departments or bureaus have not yet organized them, or if the counties have not yet completed the reports, the provincial departments or bureaus may submit those that have been organized and reported first. All must be filled out and submitted to the ministry by the end of May, so that statistics can be reviewed and completed early.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Statistics on Students in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province Over the Years <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Number of Enrolled Children Increases Year by Year</p>
<p>Except for a Decrease in the Fifteenth Year</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial United Office for Preparing Compulsory Education in Jiangsu Province has submitted various tables, such as statistics on teachers and a general overview of compulsory education, compiled from the results of investigations by various counties in Jiangsu Province for the seventeenth year of the Republic, to the Ministry of Education and distributed them to various counties for reference. The office has now compiled another type of statistical table on the number of elementary school children in Jiangsu Province over the years. The main point is to observe the growth, decline, progress, and regress in the number of children enrolled in compulsory education in various counties from the first year of the Republic to the most recent year, a total of seventeen years. The number of school children in each county and city in Jiangsu Province is listed clearly. This survey and statistics required great effort. The total number of school children (including primary schools and elementary departments of primary schools) in various cities and counties of Jiangsu Province for each year is recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) First year of the Republic: 200,456 people. (2) Second year: 201,567 people. (3) Third year: 229,761. (4) Fourth year: 260,876 people. (5) Fifth year: 284,809 people. (6) Sixth year: 297,697. (7) Seventh year: 322,991 people. (8) Eighth year: 341,930 people. (9) Ninth year: 369,099 people. (10) Tenth year: 399,751 people. (11) Eleventh year: 419,284 people. (12) Twelfth year: 435,775 people. (13) Thirteenth year: 449,510 people. (14) Fourteenth year: 474,426 people. (15) Fifteenth year: 395,922 people. (16) Sixteenth year: 437,979 people. (17) Seventeenth year: 507,644 people.</p>
<p>According to the above statistics, the number of enrolled children increases year by year, except for the fifteenth year, which showed a decrease of 78,504 people compared to the previous year. This was because the revolution first came to Jiangsu in that year, and schools in various counties were inevitably shut down due to the military situation. From the sixteenth year to the seventeenth year, as the period of political tutelage gradually arrived, the number of enrolled children increased dramatically compared to before.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Striving to Recover Educational Rights in the Concessions <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>(National Society) The Five Districts and Nine Sub-Districts of this city issued a declaration to awaken the masses and strive to recover educational rights in the concessions, stating: The imperialists' destruction of a country is nothing more than using political, cultural, and economic forces to invade other nations. However, cultural aggression is often not easily seen by ordinary people, so it is very frightening to anesthetize generally outstanding young people, causing them to unknowingly walk on their path. The oppression and aggression our nation has suffered from imperialism is not a matter of a day or two. Looking back, most of the masses are adopting an attitude of not asking and not hearing, which is truly heartbreaking. Ignoring other matters for the moment, only the educational rights in the Shanghai concessions are not recorded in any unequal treaty, and are handled by foreigners who induce young students to be their pawns, in preparation for the dream of the concessions never returning. It is hateful and frightening. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Education authorities are making active efforts to recover educational rights in the concessions, which is indeed a crucial plan. It must be known that if educational rights in the concessions are not recovered, Shanghai's education is abnormal, not whole and unified. We hope that all citizens and comrades in the party will unite and give their support, and recover educational rights in the Shanghai concessions within the shortest possible time (remainder omitted).</p>

<p>The Chinese Baseball Field</p>
<p>Practice Began Yesterday</p>
<p>Preparing for Three Major Battles</p>
<p>The Achievements of Sixteen Players</p>
<p>The Chinese baseball team of this session is still represented by the overseas Chinese from Honolulu. Yesterday afternoon at three o'clock, they arrived at the Chinese baseball field to begin practicing, preparing for three major battles with the best players from the United States and Japan in Shanghai. It is scheduled to play against the United States on the 8th and 10th, and against Japan on the 11th. Liu Dacheng, a famous Chinese player in Shanghai, also attended the practice yesterday. The team of sixteen representatives consists of veteran players and promising newcomers. Here is a description of their achievements for introduction.</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng Yunyu was the official catcher of the previous baseball team. This time, he came to China with the entire team and was promoted to a key management position, becoming the soul of the team and also serving as one of the catchers. He has been immersed in baseball for ten years.</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Enci is the coach of the entire team, holding a central and crucial position. He is considered the backbone of the Honolulu baseball community. Since joining the baseball world, he has been involved for twenty-three years. Countless young talents have been nurtured by him, and his students can be said to be all over the island. His father had eleven children in total, all of whom loved sports, and Mr. Feng was particularly outstanding. The son of a distinguished family lives up to his name. As a child, he ran fifty yards in five and one-fifth seconds. Although he is now the oldest member of the team, he still moves with agility. This is his first time attending the Far Eastern Games, and he will surely have a good performance.</p>

<p>Mr. Cai Yunping is a first-class catcher in Honolulu. In the local commercial baseball competition of the previous session, his team, the Iron Factory Team, was able to win the championship largely due to his efforts. Since then, he has been praised by everyone in the baseball world. Recently, he was elected as one of the representatives, and he is still comfortably serving as a catcher, completely as expected.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Xian is a catcher and first baseman for the team. He is a promising young player with a very bright future. This is his first time attending.</p>
<p>Lin Yan, the first baseman, is also participating in the conference for the first time. He is skilled in various sports and is a well-rounded athlete.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Shujie has enjoyed a reputation in the baseball world for the past fifteen years and is one of the most experienced players. This is his first time attending, and he has been elected as the team's vice-captain, which shows his talent.</p>
<p>Mr. He Donghan has strong arms and is good at throwing. In the previous conference, he showed his bravery and added color to the team. He is back again this time, looking even more formidable.</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Yuhe is the sole shortstop in Honolulu. In recent years, no one has surpassed him. This is the second time he has served the Chinese team, and he will surely have a better performance than before.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Rongan is the youngest member of the entire team, agile and unmatched. He throws and catches with his left hand with ease. The left field position is his strength.</p>
<p>Li Li is one of the many players in the team who are good at throwing. During the previous conference, his talent was highly valued by the Japanese and Filipinos. This is his second time attending, and his skills have greatly improved. He serves as a right fielder and third baseman.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Dongzhao's skills were appreciated by people in the previous conference. He is young and eager to improve. He has improved a lot since the last time we met. His second attendance will surely bring an amazing performance. He serves as a right fielder.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye Junxian is a promising newcomer, and his performance skills have been praised by veteran players, so he was also selected as one of the representatives. He is good at using his left hand, so he is suitable for the left field position.</p>
<p>Zhong You is the chief among the four pitchers this time. His pitches are twisting and powerful, making them difficult to catch. The outcome of the conference championship in the future depends on his skills. Due to professional reasons, he was unable to attend the previous conference. This time he is participating, adding a lot of strength. There is hope for the championship.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng Guanbing is also one of the pitchers, with a quick wrist and good at changing his pitches. This is the second time that Mr. Cheng has served China.</p>
<p>In the previous China-Philippines battle, the Filipinos were unable to cross the Lei River due to Mr. Chen Lanfang's efforts. This time, he is contributing to the Chinese team again and should be even more impressive.</p>
<p>He Yupeng is a promising newcomer among the pitchers. This is his first time attending the conference, but he is already a well-known figure in the Honolulu baseball community.</p>

<p>Won Against the Fanwangdu Team Again Last Night</p>
<p>Final Score 49 to 21</p>
<p>The Chinese basketball team played against the Fanwangdu team at 7:00 PM last night at the China Basketball Hall. Fanwangdu's defeat was foreseeable even before the game started. However, the team's outstanding performance last night exceeded our expectations. Everyone worked hard and spared no effort. Sullivan, coached by John, and Qu Hongren guarded the backcourt, with strict precautions. Tang Baokun, the forward of the Chinese team, was a brave general, but last night he was closely watched by Sullivan and Qu, taking turns, unable to move. He did not score a single point in the first half. At the end of the second half, due to Fanwangdu's declining strength, Tang was able to take the opportunity to attack and score three goals. This shows the strictness of their defense. In the first half, they competed equally, and the situation was very balanced. The once dominant Chinese team found it difficult to cross the Lei River, and the scores were quite close. The result of the first half was 23 to 13. At the beginning of the second half, Fanwangdu went all out and scored three consecutive goals, and the scores suddenly became very close. The Chinese team then deployed troops and reorganized its forces. A large force entered the championship. Fanwangdu gradually became unsustainable, and coupled with insufficient strength, they fell sharply. Only the Chinese team was seen scoring one goal after another, resulting in a score of 49 to 21. The Chinese team won. The referee was Shu Hong.</p>

<p>Indian Representatives Will Arrive in Japan</p>
<p>The Japan Sports Association previously sent an invitation to India to join, intending to expand the scope of the conference. Now, a telegram has been received from India stating that a total of four Indian representatives, led by supervisor Magaji, set sail east on the Chirawa steamer on the first of this month and are expected to arrive in Japan around the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>Lin A'er's Tennis Match</p>
<p>Lin Baohua Suffered a Miserable Defeat</p>
<p>Restoring His Reputation Seems Not Far Off</p>
<p>The Japan Sports Association received a telegram from Hong Kong stating that Lin Baohua, our country's tennis representative, has returned to Hong Kong from Saigon due to the approaching conference schedule. A match was held there on the 30th of last month between him and Philippine representative Arasin. As a result, Lin suffered a miserable defeat. Arasin was originally Lin's defeated opponent, having lost at the Shanghai conference. Arasin's tennis skills were vastly different from Lin's. Now, he has surpassed Lin in one leap, which is truly alarming to the world. According to Japanese sports experts, our country may not have any hope for this year's tennis championship. The results of the Arasin-Lin match are as follows:</p>
<p>Arasin: 6-3, 6-4, 6-2</p>

Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the Dutch Minister Oudenk visited him at the Foreign Affairs Discussion Meeting and discussed the treaty for 20 minutes before leaving.

The draft of the Sino-Turkish Commercial Treaty has been prepared by our side. The Turkish Chargé d'Affaires, Fud Pei, will go to Beijing with me in the same car tonight (i.e., last night) to begin formal negotiations.

<p>French Minister Martel Arrives in Shanghai on the 9th</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Weihan Departs for Beijing on the Night of the 10th</p>
<p>The Sino-French Vietnam Commercial Treaty was drafted in full by both parties last year. However, the French Minister delayed on various pretexts, causing the treaty to be shelved for a long time. Currently, because Mr. Zhang Weihan is about to return to Yunnan, the French side has informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, expressing its willingness to go south to sign the treaty. Minister Wang replied, requesting them to come to Beijing as soon as possible to sign the treaty and consolidate the friendship between the two countries. It is now learned that the French Minister has taken a ship from Tianjin yesterday and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 9th and go to Beijing on the 10th. Both parties have agreed to hold another meeting on the 11th to make the final revision of the full text of the treaty, and officially sign it on the 12th. It is heard that Mr. Zhang Weihan, our member, will take a night train to Beijing on the 10th to sign the treaty. After the meeting is completed, he will come to Shanghai to arrange everything and return to Yunnan on the 17th to assume the position of Provincial Commissioner and Civil Affairs Director.</p>

<p>Special District Citizens' Association</p>
<p>Seven Standing Committee Members Elected</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Special City Special District Citizens' Federation held an inauguration meeting yesterday. Thirty-three preparatory committee members attended. Representatives included Chen Dezheng from the City Party Headquarters, Pan Gongzhan from the Social Affairs Bureau, Lu Wenshao from the Business Consolidation Committee, Lin Kanghou from the Bankers' Association, Qin Minqing from the Money Dealers' Association, Huang Guangdou from the Public Security Bureau, Yuan Fang from the Finance Bureau, Wang Xiaolai from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Lu Qisheng from the Coal Industry, Xu Genghua from the National Products Maintenance Association, and representatives from dozens of other organizations and groups, totaling over a hundred people. The meeting was opened with a bell. Wang Yansong, Cheng Xiechun, and Yu Hualong were publicly nominated as the presidium. Music was played, the Party anthem was sung, and the usual formalities were observed. Chairman Wang Yansong reported on the purpose of the meeting. Chen Dezheng, representing the City Party Headquarters, read the organizational outline and delivered a speech. Pan Gongzhan from the Social Affairs Bureau delivered a speech. All committee members took an oath of office. Chairman Yu Hualong delivered a reply speech. A declaration was passed, and seven standing committee members were elected by mutual vote. The results were announced: Yu Hualong, Wang Yansong, Cheng Xiechun, Wu Zhihao, Zhang Yichen, Qian Longzhang, and Yuan Ludeng were elected. The meeting was adjourned after a photograph was taken. The chairman's report on the purpose, the speech by the representative of the City Party Headquarters, speeches by guests, and the chairman's reply speech are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Yansong reported that today is the inauguration date for the preparatory committee members of the Shanghai Special City Special District Citizens' Federation Preparatory Committee. The mission of this association is to unite the citizens, which can be divided into four aspects: (1) Why does the Party appoint a preparatory committee to unite the citizens? (2) It is not just to bear a nominal title, but to actually do the work that should be done. (3) We hope that citizens will unite and work together. (4) To relieve the suffering of the citizens and seek the welfare of the citizens. The central government is actively carrying out all work, and the development of industry and commerce is the most urgent task today. The efforts and resistance of the various road merchant associations against the imperialists in the past have yielded excellent results that everyone has seen and heard. Although the name is now abolished, its spirit must not be dissipated. The City Party Headquarters has appointed 39 people as committee members to continue to strive for the happiness of the citizens and to improve the municipal administration. This is one aspect. We do not admire vanity and should be practical. We hope that all committee members will have the same determination, take on responsibilities, and encourage each other so as not to fail their mission, and we hope that the representatives and guests will supervise and guide us from time to time. This association is very willing to accept implementation. This is the second aspect. The 39 preparatory committee members are too few in number. We hope that everyone will not regard the tasks that citizens should handle as the exclusive responsibility of this preparatory committee. They should recognize the tasks that citizens should handle as their own responsibility. Please provide guidance on any measures taken, and this association will be happy to accept them. This is the third aspect. We should strive to follow the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, "Peaceful struggle to save China," to relieve the suffering of the citizens and seek the welfare of the citizens. This is the fourth aspect. As for other purposes, they have been briefly mentioned in the declaration of this association. We should know that we have not been involved in the education issues in the concessions. As for the obligation and amount of taxation, we are actually the majority, but the treatment we receive is the opposite. In terms of fairness, there is an obligation to have rights. What rights do the Chinese in the concessions have to speak of? This time, even the issue of Chinese directors was interfered with by Westerners, which shows the attitude of Westerners. The members of this association must first consolidate the organization and foundation of this association in order to achieve the goal of equal treatment. Therefore, we hope that all citizens will unite and work together. Finished.</p>
<p>Chen Dezheng's speech: The purpose of the City Party Headquarters' appointment of the various committees to organize the Citizens' Federation has been reported by the chairman. In my opinion, the organization of the Special District Citizens' Federation is very strange. From the perspective of the right track, it seems that it should be done in accordance with the methods of local autonomy, and there is no need for this strange organization. However, this strange organization is placed in a strange place, so it cannot be said to be wrong. Originally, the Shanghai Special District was a concession, and the creation of this concession was done by the confused officials of the former Qing Dynasty. In principle, the concession was originally a place for foreigners to reside, but now the concession is no different from a colony. We Chinese all feel the pain. Everyone must rise up and organize groups closely to confront this impression, which cannot be extinguished. When the central government is rectifying merchant groups, it does not seem that there should be this strange organization because the concession is in a strange position, so the City Party Headquarters has a strange organization. It should be clear that this organization is to help the future recovery of the concession. I do not want this association to exist permanently. If it exists permanently, then the concession will never be recovered. I expect it to be abolished in a few days, and then the task of recovering the concession will also be completed in a few days. I hope that all citizens will work hard to help the government recover the concession. The chairman said, "Seeking the happiness of the citizens." We all know that the evil deeds of kidnapping, brothels, etc. are very common in the concession. Think about how the Chinese territory compares. We all feel that the concession is terrible. As for the education issue in the concession, although the funding is large, the teaching materials all contradict our intentions, which shows their neglect of education. I hope that citizens will immediately support the government's recovery of the concession and realize the welfare of the citizens. This is the intention of the City Party Headquarters. Today's oath has two words: "Do not be partisan, do not shrink back." I hope that all committee members will follow this oath and strive to become first-class people. The most feared thing is to unite into a state of neither life nor death. We all hope to have a beginning and an end, and have a great fearless spirit, work hard, and achieve the recovery of the concession as soon as possible to seek the welfare of the citizens. This is the hope of the City Party Headquarters.</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan's speech: The preparatory committee members of the Special District Citizens' Federation of this city are sworn into office today. I apologize for being late to the ceremony due to other matters. The special district is still within the sphere of influence of foreign concessions. The recovery of the concessions is the established policy of our Party. To achieve this goal, we must rely on the joint efforts of the Party and government organs and all citizens. Upholding this goal, we must persevere and will eventually succeed. Before the work is completed, I hope that all the committee members, under the guidance of the Party, will actively prepare for the establishment of the Citizens' Federation, lead all the citizens of the special district to strengthen their organization, enhance their capabilities, and seek the welfare of the citizens within the scope of the national law, and gradually cultivate the power of self-government of the citizens of the special district. Then the recovery of the concessions can be achieved naturally, and the abolition of foreign privileges can also be promoted to be realized as soon as possible by the launch of the citizens of the Shanghai Special District. The Social Affairs Bureau is concerned about the welfare of the citizens of the city. To the best of its ability, it will actively strive for promoting benefits and eliminating malpractices. There are many corrupt forces in the special district that still rely on the imperialists to exist. For example, the pawnshops in the concessions charge high interest rates and exploit the poor, which still exists today. They do not follow government orders and exploit the poor, with some charging monthly interest rates of six to nine percent. The concession authorities do not prohibit or punish them. Now the number of Chinese directors in the Public Concession Board has increased to five, and the Chinese Taxpayers' Association has its established position. I sincerely hope that after the establishment of your association, you will unite with legitimate Chinese organizations to urge the Chinese directors and all the directors of the two concession boards to first implement the elimination or reform of such bad habits or forces. The benefit of the majority of the poor is also one aspect of the welfare of the majority of citizens. There is a lot of work for your association. I would like to mention a few points as a contribution.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai's speech: Then, Wang Xiaolai, the representative of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, gave a speech, saying that everyone should unite and persevere to achieve the realization of the happiness of the citizens. (The speech is omitted)</p>
<p>Yu Hualong's reply: Today is the day for the preparatory committee members of our Shanghai Special City Special District Citizens' Federation to hold the inauguration ceremony. I am grateful for the speeches and guidance from the City Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government, and I am grateful for the presence of representatives from various groups to participate in the grand ceremony, which makes our association very glorious and our colleagues infinitely honored. However, today's inauguration, as the name suggests, means that we are responsible for preparing for the establishment of the Special District Citizens' Federation. In other words, from today onwards, our task is to organize a special group within the scope of this special district, strengthen our organization, enrich our spirit, concentrate our strength, and complete this special group in order to start fighting against the imperialists. However, the responsibility is great, and I am afraid that our strength is limited. There are many tasks, and I am afraid that our knowledge is insufficient. However, when I think of the overall interests of the citizens of the special district and the vanguard of recovering the concessions, then we will not dare to push back the calendar as long as we have breath. I hope that the superiors and various groups present today will provide guidance from time to time so as to form this special group as soon as possible and fulfill our mission. Today, I will say a few words in a rambling manner as our closing remarks of thanks. Finished.</p>

<h3 id="e141">New Export Tariff Completely Drafted <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Lower Taxes for Encouraged Exports</p>
<p>Higher Taxes for Restricted Exports</p>
<p>Xin Shanghai News reported that the new export tariff has been drafted by the National Tariff Commission. The reporter met with a member of the Tariff Commission yesterday and asked about the content of the new export tariff. According to him, the tariff was drafted after several days of mutual research by various specialized committee members. The content adopts a tiered taxation method. The tax rate for exports that should be encouraged is lower, and the tax rate for items that should be restricted from export is higher. Generally, 5% is still used as the basic tax rate, and then it is reviewed in light of the principles of the commercial treaties concluded with various countries before it can be determined.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Maze to Go to Hong Kong on a Fixed Date <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>To Discuss Establishing a Chinese Customs Inspection Branch in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Chief Inspector of Customs Maze is said to be leaving Shanghai on the 13th of this month to go to Hong Kong to discuss with the British authorities the establishment of a Chinese Customs inspection branch in Hong Kong in order to stop smuggling and increase national taxes. Since the implementation of the new tariff in China, smuggling has increased day by day, especially in Guangdong Province. Hong Kong, which is under British jurisdiction, is a free port and is only a short distance from Guangzhou, which makes it impossible to prevent smuggling and tax evasion. This has a great impact on China's tax revenue every year. Chief Inspector of Customs Maze, in view of this, once suggested to the government to establish a special department for anti-smuggling, the purpose of which was to focus on smuggling ships in Hong Kong and Taiwan. At that time, the government quite agreed with his proposal and ordered Maze to go to Hong Kong in person to discuss preventive measures with the British authorities. Therefore, Maze had a trip to Hong Kong last year. After negotiations, a draft customs agreement was drawn up. Unexpectedly, after the agreement was revised and agreed upon by both parties, the Chinese government had already approved it, but the British authorities used the excuse that Hong Kong ships had no right to navigate in the Chinese mainland and did not approve it. The regulations on navigation in the Chinese mainland stipulate that all ships navigating in the Chinese mainland must not sail to foreign ports. Since Hong Kong is under British jurisdiction, it is naturally one of the foreign ports. Therefore, the Chinese authorities are quite determined to maintain this point, and this agreement has been shelved until now. However, in the past year, smuggling has increased day by day. The Customs Administration has once again ordered Maze to go to Hong Kong to discuss this matter, in the hope that the agreement can be established as soon as possible and China's tax revenue can be maintained. If the British authorities intend to shirk their responsibility, the Chinese Customs will take strict measures, that is, to strictly monitor the four borders of Hong Kong, and to strictly inspect ships sailing into the Chinese seas from ports such as Hong Kong. It is also heard that Mr. Maze will go to Guangzhou, Xijiang and other ports this time to inspect business conditions, and will return to Shanghai in about three weeks.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Export <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Boxed Tea Not Canceled, License Application for Tax Exemption</p>
<p>National Products Maintenance Association Sends Telegram to Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Chinese National Products Maintenance Association recently sent a special telegram to the Ministry of Finance regarding the export of boxed tea, which has not been canceled and applied for exemption from the main and half taxes. It stated that the association's member, the Shanghai Tea Guild, issued a public letter stating that the industry's export of boxed tea was exempt from taxes from August of the 8th year of the Republic. At that time, a guarantee was established that if the license was not canceled within a year, it would be treated as not having been exported and the main and half taxes should be paid. Various tea warehouses have never handled the procedures for canceling licenses and have been negligent, and even by the 14th year of the Republic, the Customs was urging the payment of taxes on licenses that had not been canceled. Six years have passed, and the tea warehouses have been destroyed twice in the meantime. How can the licenses be canceled? Moreover, during these years, foreign firms such as Meishi, Huili, Lutai, Guangda Kaili, Baoyuan, Gongmei, etc. have closed down and returned to their countries, and the original licenses cannot be found. Also, tea warehouses such as Wanhelong, Rongjixiang, Qiantai Changsen, Shengsheng Henglongtai Tongchun, Tongyixiang Qianshen, Anruichang Hengfengtai, etc. have gone bankrupt and returned to their hometowns, and the original licenses cannot be found. In addition, there are foreign firms that export without licenses. For example, if 1,000 dan are shipped out without a license, then 1,000 dan will be stored on the license. This is not an exaggeration, and there are letters from foreign firms to prove it. The above reasons are all true, and the tea leaves do not exist even though the licenses have not been canceled. Therefore, they requested the exemption from the Beijing Taxation Office at that time, but it was approved as an unsettled method, saying that exemptions would be granted before the 11th year of the Republic, and taxes would be paid according to the regulations after the 12th year. They planned to continue to apply for exemption, but the central government was established, and it was also put on hold. After another three years, no one mentioned it. It was only at the end of last year that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company inquired about the previous case and did not approve the cancellation and should continue to pay. Therefore, this time, the Ministry of Finance's request for exemption was not approved. However, we can only rely on your association to verify the facts, which are all true, and the tea industry is in a desperate situation. For the sake of expanding exports, the government is planning various reward measures, and how can it bear to be stingy with this small amount and investigate the past? In the government's efforts to encourage exports, all foreign tea exports are exempt from taxes and levies, and there are various subsidies, so they can be very developed and seize our Hua tea's great profits. Merchants have a conscience and are afraid to make extra demands because the government has difficulties. However, this tax arrears cannot be investigated, and it is difficult to compensate, so we have no choice but to hope that the government will consider the situation, and please ask your association to add a note on behalf of the Ministry of Finance, approving the exemption of the main and half taxes on the licenses for green tea that have not been canceled before the 18th year. From the 19th year onwards, if there are overdue and uncanceled licenses, they must be paid in accordance with the regulations. Over the meeting, according to this, the industry has suffered from foreign tea oppression and sluggish foreign sales in recent years and has barely maintained it to this day, and feels deeply exhausted. The various reasons for the uncanceled licenses stated by the guild are true. In order to protect Chinese tea, we sincerely hope that your ministry will grant exemption from the main and half taxes on the said uncanceled licenses from this year, and must pay in accordance with the regulations from this year onwards, so as to alleviate the merchants' difficulties and assist in maintaining the industry. We cannot bear the urgency and anticipation of it, and please instruct us to obey, which is a virtue. Wang Jiean, Wang Xingyi, and Wang Hanqiang, standing committee members of the Chinese National Products Maintenance Association, kowtowed.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Zhejiang Provincial Government's Approval to Protect Cocoon Merchants <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangzhewan Silk Cocoon General Office, because the new cocoons in the inland will soon be on the market, silk cocoon merchants have set off one after another with money to go to various cocoon-producing areas to purchase fresh cocoons. However, the situation in various regions is not peaceful, and the situation is more serious than in previous years. Therefore, a series of articles were drafted and submitted to the National Government and the provincial governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to dispatch troops and police to provide solid protection. The original presentation has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now found that the cocoon market in Zhejiang Province is earlier, and the presentation for protecting the cocoon market has been submitted earlier. Huang Jin, chairman of the General Office, received a decree from Zhang, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, stating that all the presented items are known. The measures to protect the cocoon market have been ordered to the Department of Civil Affairs and the Security Office to jointly plan the military and police joint protection methods, and ordered the relevant departments to comply with them. According to the previous situation, we will re-order the relevant departments to check and handle it.</p>

<p>Insurance Companies Insist on Following New Regulations</p>
<p>Due to a Loss of More Than 40,000 Taels Last Year</p>
<p>The Shanghai Insurance Association, a member of various insurance companies, held a temporary meeting at the Zilin newspaper office at noon yesterday to make a final discussion on the issue of cocoon insurance rates. The meeting unanimously decided to firmly maintain the newly established regulations. The reason is that last year, due to the low insurance premiums and the unstable political situation, the entire insurance industry actually lost more than 40,000 taels. This year, bandits are rampant in the inland, which is even more terrifying. Therefore, the implementation of the new regulations is feared to suffer even greater losses, and all manufacturers have been notified to check.</p>

<p>Da Lu Bao reported that Philippine Senate Speaker Quezon is going to the United States to promote the independence of the Philippine Islands and will pass through Shanghai within this week, staying in Shanghai for about two days. He is scheduled to stay at the Cathay Hotel and will meet with important Chinese figures to discuss matters. However, since this trip to Shanghai is not a formal visit, he does not want to attend any formal banquets. According to reports, eight members of the Philippine Independence Movement Committee have been in the United States. Mr. Quezon recently suffered from a serious illness, but has now recovered and can travel by sea. Because there are many important matters in the US Congress that need to be dealt with urgently, he is working hard to get on the road and rush to Washington to preside over the independence movement.</p>

<p>To Mr. Chen Gongbo in Peiping, After reading the newspaper, I learned that you, Mr. Chen, are in Peiping and received newspaper reporters and made a speech, in which you said that in the winter of the year before last, I went to Shanghai to meet with you to elect Chiang as president and seek your consent. I was very surprised. This kind of fantasy has never been heard of. Moreover, since I said goodbye to you, Mr. Chen, in Nanchang in the spring of the 16th year of the Republic, we have never met each other. In recent years, I have not known the whereabouts of your actions. Then, where did the meeting in Shanghai come from? You, Mr. Chen, do not hesitate to fabricate facts to promote yourself, which can be said to be extremely boring. Please do not create rumors again and deceive yourself. Zhang Qun, Fish.</p>

<p>Instructions: "Instructions from Shen Yuan, representative of the Jiangsu High Court President": Now is a period of political tutelage, and also when we have recovered extraterritoriality rights. The quality of the court's handling of matters truly carries immense weight. The court is the agency to protect human rights, and judges hold the power to administer impartial justice, which concerns the lives and property of the people. It should be handled according to law and not be neglected. All colleagues should be honest and self-disciplined, and strive to do better. If the authorities can put in more effort, lawsuits and injustices can be reduced, and the people can have more happiness. Shanghai is a major commercial port where Chinese and foreigners reside together, and the number of cases is much greater than in other courts. The selection of the Chief Judge is of utmost importance. Chief Judge Shen has served in the legal field for many years, and his knowledge and experience are both excellent. As the former Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai court, he is already experienced. Now that former Chief Judge Yang has been transferred to the special district court, the Ministry has promoted Chief Judge Shen to fill the vacancy. This is a manifestation of the emphasis on talent. It is hoped that Chief Judge Shen will, together with the staff, follow the teachings of the late Premier, possess a spirit of fearlessness, not be afraid of difficulties, not be complacent, and conscientiously reorganize and actively revitalize the court, setting an example for all courts, and bringing a unique brilliance to the Jiangsu judicial system. This is what the President deeply expects. "Instructions from Zhong Shangbin, representative of the Jiangsu High Court Chief Prosecutor": Today is the date of the swearing-in ceremony for Chief Prosecutor Liu and Chief Judge Shen of the Jiangsu Shanghai Local Court. I, Shangbin, was commissioned by Chief Wang of the Jiangsu High Court to represent him in supervising the ceremony. I am very pleased to be able to participate in this grand event. Shanghai is the most important commercial area of our country. In the past, under the oppression of foreign nations, the consular jurisdiction system was established, infringing upon our national sovereignty. Now that consular jurisdiction has just been recovered, the international status of our nation has been slightly restored. However, the special spirit of our nation has not yet been promoted. The Premier said that our nation's inherent morality (loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, peace), and inherent intelligence (investigating things, extending knowledge, making intentions sincere, rectifying the heart, cultivating oneself, regulating the family, governing the state, pacifying the world) must be preserved and enhanced. Everyone serving in domestic institutions must fulfill this responsibility, especially those serving in the Shanghai judicial institutions, which are observed by foreign nations. They must fulfill this responsibility even more. Chief Prosecutor Liu graduated from the University of Lyon in France and has a profound understanding of law. Now that consular jurisdiction has been recovered, he shoulders this important mission and will surely promote the spirit of our nation, preserve and enhance our nation's inherent morality and intelligence. Chief Judge Shen has long been in charge of prosecution affairs at the Shanghai court, and his character and learning are both excellent, which I have always admired. Now that Chief Prosecutor Liu and Chief Judge Shen are working together in one place, they will surely cooperate sincerely and complement each other. I hope that Chief Prosecutor Liu will pay attention to the three words "清慎勤" (integrity, prudence, and diligence) in his duties and encourage himself with them.</p>
<p>Speech: Pan Gongzhan stated briefly, "I am very pleased to participate in the ceremony for Chief Judge Shen and Chief Prosecutor Liu today because Chief Judge Shen has served as Chief Prosecutor in Shanghai for many years, and the new Chief Prosecutor is also very knowledgeable in law. With his experience and knowledge, I am confident that he will be able to cope with the affairs of Shanghai society. Therefore, we are very satisfied. According to Mr. Wang Yunwu's research on the increase in population and crime at the Central Research Institute, the increase in population in Shanghai is unparalleled in the world, but the number of criminals has also increased at the same time. Therefore, a village of several hundred people cannot be compared to a city of several hundred thousand people. Shanghai has a population of over 2.8 million, and a few years ago it was 2 million. According to his research, the increase in crime is faster than the increase in population, resulting in more criminals. To remedy this, on the one hand, education must be provided to bring people back on the right track, and on the other hand, economic development and industrial projects must be undertaken to prevent panic about food, clothing, and housing. However, this is a fundamental solution. On the other hand, a symptomatic solution is also needed because before the fundamental solution is found, there should be no leniency towards those who have committed crimes, and they must be dealt with strictly in order to reduce the number of offenders. Regarding the symptomatic solution, we cannot help but hope that the court... some say that party rule and the rule of law are in conflict, but this is completely wrong. We must use the Party's principles to legislate, which is the so-called Party's rule of law. We hope that the gentlemen in the judicial field will not forget the Party's principles when reporting and enforcing the law, that is, to deal severely with the communist reactionary elements who do all kinds of evil deeds because they oppose the Party and violate the law. Because they are cruel and have no feelings, they want to revolt against the Kuomintang and the country, and give China away to Russia. It is the ideological reactionary elements who are the real reactionaries, while the workers and peasants are followers. Judicial independence means not being interfered with by any administrative authority. Therefore, it is hoped that the judiciary will be the Party's judiciary. I have high hopes for these two gentlemen. I am straightforward, so I say whatever I think of, to contribute to the public."</p>
<p>Response: "Chief Judge Shen's Response" briefly stated that the instructions from the superiors and the guidance from the Party representatives were very detailed regarding the judicial aspect. I am aware of my own weakness and will work harder in the future. Speaking of judicial independence, it does not mean that everyone is independent. Judicial independence cannot be achieved without the support of all courts. In fact, the judiciary is not the judiciary of one person, but is established by the state for the people and for all the people. Those in the judicial field should not think that since I am in the judicial field, the judiciary is mine, because that will not work. Today, doing things in the judicial field means being the judiciary. Not doing things in the judicial field means being like ordinary people. It is difficult to have every judicial official agree on everything, but as long as everyone is loyal to their duties and walks the same path, they must understand that the judiciary is for the benefit of all the people. That is what I mean. I am weak, so I feel apprehensive. Fortunately, there are wise officials to supervise me, and I have served in Shanghai for many years, and I rarely interact with people outside. In the future, if there is anything I do not do well, I hope to be guided. Today's hospitality is simple, I hope you will forgive me, and so on. "Chief Prosecutor Liu's Response" briefly stated that I am very honored by everyone's presence today. A country has rights both internally and externally, and the judiciary is one of the internal rights. Judicial independence does not mean going beyond national sovereignty. In the third and fourth years of the Republic of China, the Beijing Ministry of Justice repeatedly prohibited judicial officials from joining the Party, but the judiciary is a kind of spirit and is not interfered with because of a person's party membership. Judicial officials should act according to the Party's program and principles, and the country will achieve peace. Therefore, I hope that judicial officials will run into the Kuomintang position and work hard. I hope that our colleagues will work hard together.</p>

<p>Ministry of Communications Appoints Engineer to Shanghai Main Station</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Communications took over all radio communications from the Construction Committee last year, it has been actively planning and launching a national radio communication network to facilitate communication between various regions. It is now learned that this plan has long been submitted by the Radio Management Bureau to the Ministry of Communications for approval. The country is divided into nine major regions, with Shanghai designated as the first region. Minister Wang of the Ministry of Communications believes that communication network affairs should be expedited and has specially appointed Xu Liang as the engineer of the Shanghai Main Station. After being appointed, Mr. Xu has already arrived in Shanghai to take charge, it is said.</p>

<p>Available on Sundays and Holidays</p>
<p>The local post office received a letter from China National Aviation Corporation informing them that the company's planes will continue to fly as usual on Sundays and holidays starting May 1st. Therefore, letters and postcards for airmail delivery between Shanghai and Hankou can be mailed every day without interruption, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Public Concession <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Streetcar Strike Update</p>
<p>The streetcar strike in the Public Concession has lasted for nine days. Not only the public feels inconvenienced, but the company is also very anxious. After negotiations with the compradore Mr. Hu broke down, the company issued a notice on the afternoon of the 5th, stating that ticket sellers and drivers could receive a daily allowance of ten cents, as well as a subsidy of three dollars. It also announced that work would resume on the morning of the 6th. Upon hearing this, the strike committee and all the workers, starting early in the morning of the 6th, dozens of strike committee members went separately to the Shanghai East, Shanghai West, Zhabei three district offices and news outposts to report the above news to the workers and solicit their opinions. By 6:00 PM, dozens of committee members had returned to the presidium office, reporting on the situation of the workers in each district. Yesterday, there were twelve mass meetings. In addition, at each news outpost (there are more than ten), there were nineteen to twenty people gathered to talk to the strike committee members and report important news to them. The presidium of the strike committee immediately passed the following resolutions: (1) The company's announcement is completely deceiving and insulting to the workers, because (a) the subsidy of three dollars is completely empty talk. Is the subsidy a subsidy for wage losses during the strike period, or a subsidy for other losses? Moreover, the subsidy may be given today but not tomorrow. (b) The three-dollar subsidy for ticket sellers and drivers has nothing to do with the coppersmiths, specialists, lamplighters, road workers, etc. Isn't this dividing our workers' solidarity? Therefore, we should insist on the strike and strive for the thirteen demands. (2) Anyone who drives the streetcars first, whether a Chinese lackey or a foreign scab, and undermines the strike will be severely dealt with. (3) Intensify organizational work, propaganda work, patrol team work, and news gathering work. We will not resume work until we achieve victory.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Chinese and Foreign Shipping Companies <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Actively Expanding Yangtze River Shipping</p>
<p>The slump in Yangtze River shipping has reached its extreme recently. There is a shortage of both incoming and outgoing goods. Due to the sluggish business, various companies are seeking remedial measures, such as lowering shipping rates and building more fast ships, all in order to gain an advantage. During this period of sluggish business, Chinese and foreign shipping companies are making fundamental reforms to improve the situation. Planning ahead is the key to business competition and demonstrates the foreign merchants' painstaking efforts and full dedication to operating on the Yangtze River route. The situation of the competition between Chinese and foreign ships is described separately below:</p>
<p>China Merchants Group Developing Business: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's eight Yangtze River ships have not been able to fully resume service for a long time. This time, the headquarters ordered the Jian Guo, Jiang Xin, and others to be returned. Six ships have now been confirmed to be sailing on the Yangtze River route. The four major Yangtze River ships (Jiang Shun, Jiang An, Jiang Hua, and Jiang Xin) will be running on a regular schedule starting this month. The business department has finalized the regulations, and each ship will run at least sixteen times a month. The above number of trips has been scheduled for May. When the Jiang Yu ship returns to Shanghai, the number of trips can be increased to nineteen times a month. If each ship carries an average of 5,000 taels worth of cargo and passengers back and forth, the monthly income on the Yangtze River route will be over 100,000 taels. This is the month with the most Yangtze River liners for the company since April last year. If the sailing schedule is accurate, the business will naturally improve.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Competition for Passengers: After the dissolution of the Public Ticket Bureau, most foreign ships took back the ticketing rights for themselves. Although Chinese Yangtze River ships are still contracted by business managers, first-class tickets are also owned by the company. Last month, foreign Yangtze River ships planned to take advantage of the gold price increase to increase fares. At that time, it had already been proposed, but it was opposed by the Chinese merchants when soliciting the consent of the Chinese ships, so the price increase was invisibly canceled. It is now heard that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has signed a sales agency contract with the China Travel Service for Yangtze River downstream passenger tickets in order to expand its passenger business as much as possible.</p>
<p>British Merchants Urgently Building New Ships: In recent years, fast ships have become popular in the shipping industry. Those that have a high speed and can reach their destination quickly will surely have good business. The British company Jardine Matheson in this port has already built two fast motor ships for use on the Yangtze River. One ship, the Wuhu, which operates on the upper reaches, will soon come to Shanghai to start service. One ship, which operates on the Shanghai-Hankou route, is also under construction. Each ship can travel at a speed of over fourteen nautical miles per hour. Jardine Matheson is also building a fast ship in a shipyard in this port, using a motor engine. It is said that the construction will be completed soon, and the name of the ship has been determined, seemingly as the "Sheng He," which is prepared to compete in the business on this route. This year, it will also be able to sail. The day when each of these new ships is completed will be the beginning of competition for Yangtze River shipping.</p>
<p>Foreign Ships Fully Open on the Upper Reaches: Foreign ships on the upper Yangtze River went on strike starting March 20th to resist the increase in wages for the river pilots. At that time, twenty-eight ships suspended operations. Later, the Jijiang and Nissin companies were the first to individually agree to the wage increase. On April 20th, American and Japanese ships first departed from Shanghai for Chongqing to resume service. British Jardine Matheson ships also went to Yichang to wait for the resumption of service. As for the Taikoo company, it has a total of eight ships operating on the Yichang-Chongqing route. After the suspension of service, most of them returned to Shanghai. Now, a telegram has been received from Yichang, saying that the wage increase conditions have been agreed upon, and the river pilots have all boarded the ships. Therefore, the Wanxian, Wantong, Wanliu, and other ships in Shanghai have all received orders to sail. They will load large quantities of cotton yarn in this port and go directly to Chongqing. They can all sail upstream before the 11th. From today onwards, there will be thirty-nine ships operating on the Chongqing route, and Chinese merchant ships will only account for eight of them.</p>

<p>Petition Representatives Have Returned to Shanghai</p>
<p>Since the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department levied internal river management funds, the shipping industry in various parts of the province has petitioned the provincial government several times, but to no avail. Last month, Shanghai shipping industry representatives Cha Hongbin and others went to the authorities in Beijing and the province to petition again. It is now learned that the representatives have returned to Shanghai, but it is said that they have not been able to achieve the goal of abolishing the funds.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Embezzlement of Compensation for May 30th Massacre <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Some People Heartlessly Claiming Compensation</p>
<p>Martyrs' Grievances Buried Underground</p>
<p>Claimants Without Conscience</p>
<p>Authorities Should Punish Severely</p>
<p>The May 30th Massacre occurred several years ago. It was not until the end of last year, after repeated negotiations, that a portion of the compensation was obtained from the Municipal Council and distributed to the families of the victims. Unexpectedly, the embezzlement of compensation has recently occurred. A lawsuit has been filed in the Special District Local Court. The plaintiffs are Hu Changsheng and Chen Fucai, representatives of the May 30th Massacre Victims' Families Association. The defendants are Xu Zhijian, owner of the Zhichengtai Tea Shop at 152 Maode Road, Xiaoshadu, and Li Ruiqing, Wang Zhaohua, He Hanwen, and others, members of the internal and external cotton mill workers' union. According to the plaintiffs' complaint, the association distributed compensation to the victims' families on January 25th of this year. Considering that most of them were from other provinces and were not familiar with each other, the association repeatedly stated that it would not issue compensation unless the family members came to the association in person and had a shop guarantee. The procedures were thorough and careful. Unexpectedly, a person claiming to be Luo Wenlang, the elder brother of the victim Luo Wenzhao, came to the association accompanied by Li Ruiqing, Wang Zhaohua, He Hanwen, and others to register with a guarantee from Zhichengtai Tea Shop, requesting compensation of 2,000 yuan. The association verified that there was no error and immediately paid the compensation. Recently, Luo Wenlang filed a complaint with the Municipal Party Department, alleging that the compensation he received did not match the amount reported in the newspaper and requested an investigation. The Municipal Party Department transferred the case to the Municipal Government for investigation. The case is serious, and the association has also conducted a thorough investigation. The guarantor has already fled the shop. The case involves colluding with the guarantor to fraudulently obtain compensation, which constitutes the crime of fraudulently obtaining property. It violates criminal law and damages the national image. If it is not dealt with promptly, the suspects will surely escape without a trace. Therefore, the plaintiffs request that the defendants be immediately arrested and brought to justice. Upon receiving the complaint, the court issued summonses, ordering the Huisi Police Station to notify the defendants to appear in court for trial yesterday afternoon. When the time came, Judge Wu Tingqi opened the court. Xu Zhijian, the owner of Zhicheng Tea Shop, claimed to have a heart pain and was accompanied by his wife, Xu Jiangshi, and a representative lawyer. The other three defendants, Li, Wang, and He, had all fled and were not present. According to the plaintiff Hu Changsheng's statement, the 2,000 yuan compensation was issued on December 28th of the lunar calendar. Luo Wenlang claimed that he only received 240 yuan, but the receipt he issued was for 500 yuan, and so on. Judge Wu stated that the witnesses were not all present and could not proceed. He ordered the defendants to be summoned in person and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Rampant Pirates <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Severely Affecting the Fish Market</p>
<p>The Jin Changtai Boat Was the Most Miserable</p>
<p>Not a Single Fish or Grain of Rice Left</p>
<p>The Crew Has Been Starving for Two Whole Days</p>
<p>The Ferocity of the Pirates Is Evident</p>
<p>The spring fish market in Wusong has always been the best of commerce in the entire town. Not only do those in the fish business rely on it to make a living, but many Hakka people from Qingkou, Shandong, and Yancheng, Jiangsu, also use it to make a living. Every year after the Qingming Festival, they arrive in Wusong one after another to gather and wait for fishing boats to enter the port so that they can be active. The total amount of business is over 500,000 yuan each year, excluding the fish and small goods sold by the fishing boat crews themselves, which are sold through the Cuisheng, Binfeng, and Shentai firms. In previous years, the number of boats arriving has been about a hundred in the first catch and at least a hundred in the second catch, with as many as two or three hundred boats. Unexpectedly, this year, more than a hundred pirate ships and five hundred pirates were found in the fishing waters. Relying on their sophisticated firearms, they wreaked havoc, either robbing ships and goods, or kidnapping people for ransom. Those with cash were required to pay 80 yuan per ship to obtain a white flag from the Qinghuai gang pirate leader Shen Guanxi (with a large fish character in the middle of the flag and the words "Public Charity Organization" on the side). Only then would they be allowed to fish. However, there are very few ships with cash. As a result, less than forty fishing boats arrived in Wusong for the first catch. The largest and most famous fish market in Jiangsu Province is Wusong, followed by Liuhe, and then the Pengjia Bridge in the jurisdiction of Hupu. It is said that only two fishing boats arrived at Pengjia Bridge, which shows the decline of its business. Currently, less than thirty boats have arrived in Wusong for the second catch. The fish they have caught only fill one hold or half a hold, and the rest has been robbed. What those pirates pay most attention to are the defensive guns and cannons on the boats. All those that have them are robbed. The most tragic was the Jin Changtai boat that arrived in Wusong yesterday morning. Not only was there not a single fish left, but also not a grain of rice. Even the firewood, rice, clothes, and bedding brought by the boat were searched and robbed without leaving anything. Not yet satisfied, they kidnapped three crew members, claiming that they had to prepare 10,000 yuan to ransom the hostages. Because the boat had run out of food, it sailed to Wusong specifically. They had not had a meal for two whole days on the way. When they arrived in Wusong, the Cuisheng fish firm immediately sent a load of rice to the boat, and the crew was able to have a full meal. According to Wang, the supervisor of the anti-smuggling battalion's patrol boat No. 2, he saw that the boat had been completely searched and robbed of everything except the boat equipment. The tragic situation was truly heartbreaking. Currently, because the pirates are so rampant, the spring fish market has become disintegrated. Not only is the customs revenue greatly affected, but the capital of the three firms is also at stake. When spring fish boats go to sea, they prepare expenses from the fish firms, at least 200 yuan per boat, and as much as 500 or 600 yuan. When the fish are caught and sold in Wusong, the money is deducted. They get commissions and can recover the loans. This has always been the case. Unexpectedly, this year, not only is there no commission, but also the capital has become a bubble. In recent days, the managers of the fish firms have been crestfallen and deeply worried. Another saying is that a famous Zhao (not a pirate) in the Huaixuhai gang expressed opposition to Shen Guanxi, and any fishing boat with Shen's flag was not allowed to fish. Therefore, the fishermen felt that there was no way out. If the pirates are so ferocious and this continues, the fishermen's suffering is unknown.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Suicide Attempt by a Couple in the New Jiangsu Hotel <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Woman Dead, Man Detained by Police</p>
<p>Two guests, a man and a woman, checked into room 30 of the New Jiangsu Hotel at 295 Hubei Road a few days ago. The man, named Zhang Zhiyun, was 27 years old and from Hangzhou. The woman, named Zhang Jinbao, was 27 years old and from Pinghu. The man was dressed fashionably and looked like a middle-class businessman. The woman had a bob haircut and wore leather shoes, and looked like a young woman from a wealthy family. However, when they checked in, they both looked worried. The service staff often saw this kind of expression on guests, so they didn't pay much attention. Around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, panting sounds were frequently heard from their room. The tea attendant knew that something was wrong and wanted to knock on the door to see what was happening, but there was no response after knocking several times. The tea attendant urgently reported to the front desk. They pried open the door and saw the man and woman lying stiffly on the bed with pale faces. The hotel reported the incident to the Laozha Police Station, and detective Zhao Ziren rushed to investigate. He saw that Zhang Jinbao was barely breathing and Zhang Zhiyun was still able to speak. Two cigarette paper bags were found next to him. According to him, he was working at Yuhexing at 233 Xinmatou in Nanshi. Recently, he had become addicted to gambling and went to a gambling den in the French Concession every day, resulting in a large debt that he was too ashamed to face people. Therefore, he wanted to commit suicide by swallowing raw opium. The female guest, Zhang Jinbao, was Zhiyun's mistress. Seeing Zhang taking poison, she decided to die with him to show her determination, and so on. They were sent to Renji Hospital by a Chinese police car for treatment. The doctor said that the woman had taken a large dose of poison and was unlikely to survive, while the man could still be saved. Zhang Jinbao died yesterday afternoon. The police sent the body to the forensic examination office on Fielun Road and scheduled a report to the Special District Court to come to the scene for examination today. Zhang Zhiyun took a lighter dose of poison and was temporarily detained by the police yesterday afternoon. They plan to interrogate him together today.</p>

<p>Schemes to Defraud a Large Sum</p>
<p>Feigning Madness, Falls into a Dung Pit</p>
<p>A Large Amount of Banknotes Hidden Underground</p>
<p>Defrauds 2,000 Yuan in Nantong</p>
<p>Escapes to Shanghai, Ultimately Arrested</p>
<p>Last year, the Da Sheng Cotton Mill in Nantong had 6,000 yuan in cash stolen. At the time, Shen Zelin, an employee of the mill from Haimen, suddenly appeared to be insane, behaving erratically. One day, he even fell into a dung pit. The mill's management initially did not suspect any connection between this behavior and the theft of the money. However, after some time, they began to suspect that Shen's madness was a pretense, intended to cover up the crime. After severe questioning, Shen confessed, admitting that he had hidden the stolen money underground in the mill's garden. A search was conducted, and 4,500 yuan was recovered. The remaining 1,500 yuan had been spent. Shen was fired, and the guarantor compensated for the missing amount. The matter was then put to rest. However, on April 30th of this year, Shen suddenly went to the Da Sheng Cotton Mill in Shanglinsha, claiming to be the manager sent by the Nantong Da Sheng Cotton Mill to audit the accounts. Han Jiping, the director of Da Sheng in Shanglinsha, initially treated him hospitably. When Shen requested 2,000 yuan, Han stated that they would need to go to the main factory in Nantong for verification. Shen agreed, but requested the money in advance. Han, believing that there would be no problem since they were going together, paid the full amount. They then traveled to Nantong. As they approached a middle school in front of the main factory, Shen claimed that his younger brother was studying there and asked to go into the school to visit him, requesting Han to wait outside. After Shen entered the school, Han waited for a long time, but Shen did not come out. It turned out that he had seized the opportunity to escape. Han reported the incident to the main factory, which then reported it to the local Public Security Bureau for investigation. It was discovered that Shen had taken a ship to Shanghai and was hiding in room 317 of the Dongya Hotel. The factory sent Cai Junhe and another person to Shanghai to report to the Lao Zha Gate Police Station. Detective Wang Yingjie arrested Shen Zelin at 9:00 AM the day before. A passbook from the China Industrial Bank with a balance of 1,400 yuan, as well as 130 yuan in cash, were confiscated. The following morning, Shen was taken to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Xu interrogated him and ordered him to be detained pending further investigation by the Nantong Local Court.</p>

<p>Temporary Imprisonment</p>
<p>Does Not Meet Bail Regulations</p>
<p>Difficult to Release Until Sentence is Served</p>
<p>Cassia, a Mexican national, was arrested last summer for opening a roulette gambling den at 151 Jing'an Temple Road. The former Provisional Court sentenced him to one year in prison and a fine of 2,000 yuan. The Mexican national appealed, but the former Appellate Court upheld the original verdict after review, and he was sent to prison to serve his sentence. More than half a year has passed. Recently, after the reorganization of the two courts, lawyer Fei Si, representing Cassia, cited the current regulations on bail for prisoners, listing reasons and petitioning the Chief Prosecutor of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court to grant bail.</p>
<p>The petition has been submitted for nearly ten days. It is now learned that Chief Prosecutor Wang has rejected the request, stating that the prisoner's request does not meet the requirements of Article 1 of the bail regulations. Therefore, Cassia's release will have to wait until his sentence is completed.</p>

<p>The Woman Volunteers in Court to be a Concubine</p>
<p>The Woman is First Returned to Her Mother</p>
<p>Zhao Hongzhang, a Shandong native and partner in the Donglu Tobacco Company at 1825 Tangshan Road, was recently accused by Chen Dong, a Ningbo woman residing at 503 Humility Lane, Huade Road, of enticing and harboring her 19-year-old daughter, Yuexiang. Judge Ge of the Special District Local Court summoned them for questioning yesterday morning. According to the plaintiff Chen Dong, the defendant Zhao Hongzhang enticed her daughter Yuexiang to a small teahouse in Tilanqiao at noon on the 23rd of last month. Afterwards, several people hired a car, took the girl away, and hid her whereabouts. Zhao had already married last December. That morning, Zhao's brother came to Chen's house, saying that he was willing to give 700 yuan on behalf of his younger brother Hongzhang to take her daughter as a concubine. She immediately refused. Unexpectedly, at noon, her daughter was forcibly abducted. She requested an investigation. According to the defendant Zhao Hongzhang, he met Yuexiang in August of last year. Her mother was willing to marry the daughter to him, but he did not agree because he already had a wife. That day at noon, Yuexiang ran to his house, saying that she had been beaten by her mother and did not want to go back, asking him to find a way to rescue her, or she would commit suicide. So he and Yuexiang went to a hotel on Six Ma Road temporarily. The next day, he hired a lawyer to notify her family. Now, Yuexiang is willing to be his concubine, and he has brought her to court. The plaintiff's statement is not true. Yuexiang testified that she was beaten by her mother, so she eloped privately. She and Zhao had a physical relationship as early as last autumn, and she willingly belongs to Zhao as a concubine. After the defendant hired lawyer Fan Gang to debate with the plaintiff's lawyer, Judge Ge ordered Yuexiang to be returned to her mother Chen Dong. The case was adjourned for another hearing.</p>

<p>Dispute Over Stall Space</p>
<p>The stall space in front of the Ganfeng Fish Shop at 16 Pu, French Concession, South City, originally belonged to the shop. However, it has long been occupied by the adjacent Fukang Fish Shop. Ganfeng did not argue with them because they were in the same industry. Recently, Ganfeng received a large shipment of fish, and there was not enough space in the shop to store it. So, they politely asked Fukang to return the stall space for one day. Unexpectedly, Fukang refused outright. Ganfeng argued reasonably, but it was to no avail. The next day (the 25th of last month), Zhang Zhisheng and Shui Jia Kuan, the managers of Fukang, Taichang, and Yuantong fish shops, led thirty to forty shop assistants and porters, wielding wooden sticks, and swarmed into the Ganfeng Fish Shop, beating anyone they encountered. More than ten shop assistants of Ganfeng were injured on the spot, five of whom were seriously injured. Ganfeng sent them to the hospital and filed a criminal complaint against Zhang and Shui in the French court. Yesterday morning, the French court issued arrest warrants and sent detectives Lu Jinshun and others to the Yuantong Fish Shop to arrest Shui Jia Kuan. Zhang Zhisheng was at the Taichang Fish Shop and fled upon hearing the news. Shui Jia Kuan is currently detained at the Lujiawan Police Station, awaiting the arrest of Zhang Zhisheng before the court hearing.</p>

<p>The *North China Daily News* reported that on Sunday evening, a Westerner named Camerlong was driving a car with his family when a Chinese man suddenly ran in front of the car in the middle of Gaun Road, trying to stop it. Camerlong quickly swerved the car to the side of the road to avoid him. Unexpectedly, the man still jumped to the side of the car and slashed Camerlong's wife with a knife, slightly injuring her left arm. As Camerlong drove the car forward a bit, he encountered an Annamite police officer, who accompanied him back to find the assailant. When they arrived, two French soldiers were already fighting with him. The two soldiers were slashed in the hands and face. Camerlong and the Annamite police officer then seized the man from behind. Examining his weapon, it was a rusty short knife. This person is believed to be a madman and is currently detained at the police station, awaiting investigation of his background.</p>
<h3 id="e165">New Chang Steersman Commits Suicide by Drowning <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Body Recovered</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's New Chang ship recently returned to Shanghai from Guangdong and then returned to Guangzhou due to some business. On the 1st of this month, around 12:00 at night, while docking at Bai E Tan, the ship's steersman Chen Fusheng suddenly jumped into the river and died. His body was missing. Yesterday, the ship had already returned to Shanghai. According to the crew, the steersman Chen Fusheng was 59 years old and from Ningbo. He was usually very enthusiastic and honest in his work. He has been a driver at New Chang for three years without any faults. Recently, there was no difference.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>There was no sign of mental illness. However, twelve hours before the drowning, he told the ship's first mate that his mind was already lost and he would die soon, so he wanted to drown himself. The first mate tried to comfort him and persuaded him not to have such thoughts. Chen Fusheng insisted that the drowning was his own will and could sign a letter as proof to the first mate. Later, he told the head of the sailors that he wanted to drown himself because his mind was lost and he could not survive. After the head persuaded him repeatedly to rest, the head sent someone to Chen's bunk twice to see if he was safely in bed, so the sailors felt relieved and went to sleep themselves. Unexpectedly, at around 12:00 midnight, Chen took advantage of everyone's sleep to sneak out and drown himself. At that time, a small boat selling goods was docked outside the New Chang ship. The boatman heard someone fall into the river and reported to the crew of the New Chang ship. The crew went to Chen's bunk and found that Chen was missing. They knew that he had drowned and immediately tried to retrieve him, but his body was nowhere to be found. The search continued for half a day the next day, but there was no sign of him. The New Chang then returned to Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai yesterday, the crew notified his family and reported to the head office. It was heard that the head office received a telegram from Guangzhou yesterday, saying that Chen Fusheng's body had been recovered by the Guangdong Provincial Water Police and will be transported to Shanghai after burial. Yesterday afternoon, Chen's wife and children came to the ship to inquire about the truth of the matter.</p>

<p>Drowned in a Boiling Water Pot and Died</p>
<p>Zhu Xuegen, 40 years old, from Yancheng, Jiangbei, was a cleaner at the Municipal Health Bureau. His wife, Chen, was 38 years old. They lived together in a thatched house at No. 6 Jianyu Lane, Hainan West Alley, South Street, outside Xiaonanmen, South City. Zhu was overjoyed because his wife, who had never had children, was suddenly pregnant. On the 29th of last month, Mao, the wife of their co-resident Liu Dengji, set up a stove outside the thatched house to cook because the house was too small. After pouring boiling water into the pot, she went inside to fetch something. Zhu's wife, Chen, remembered that her shoes were drying on the roof of the thatched house and wanted to take them down quickly. However, because the house was high and she was short, she could not reach them. So, she used a wooden stool to elevate herself. As she reached out to retrieve the shoes, Liu's wife, Mao, carrying something, suddenly walked out from inside. In the rush, she accidentally bumped into Chen, causing Chen to lose her balance and fall into the pot of boiling water. Instantly, her whole body was scalded. When she was pulled up, her skin was red and blistered, and she fainted from the pain. Zhu immediately sent her to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. However, because the injuries were too severe, she showed no improvement after several days. So, she was taken home the day before, and she died that evening. Zhu believed that his wife's death was entirely Liu's wife's fault. He immediately grabbed Liu and handed her over to Fan Shiqing, the security guard at the 26th post, who brought her back to the First District, Third Precinct. Chief Jin ordered an interrogation. Because it was a matter of life and death, he ordered that the suspect be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court along with the original documents for investigation.</p>

<p>Sailor Tragically Drowned</p>
<p>During the fishing season, the Wusong Yunzao Creek has been a place where fishing boats from various gangs dock and unload. In recent days, there have been more than a hundred fishing boats coming to Wusong, so that the port surface is full of masts and sails and is extremely crowded. Yesterday morning at around 11:00, the Yan Cheng Gang chief manager of Bao Feng Fish Shop, Dong Lu Qing, the Tong Chang Tai and Gong Fa Sheng Wang De Shun and other three fishing boats were towed into the Wusong estuary by the Hua Fa small steamer and slowly sailed into the Yunzao Creek. They were planning to choose a location to anchor and dock when the Changshun tugboat of Yong'an Cotton Mill and two other small steamers were nearby. Seeing the fishing boat approaching, fearing that the two sides would collide and cause a disaster, they immediately gave way. Unexpectedly, during the turning of the Changshun tugboat, the stern of the boat went under the hawser of the Tong Chang Tai fishing boat. Jiang Zhihai, the deputy fireman of the boat, who was standing at the stern of the boat working, did not notice it and was knocked into the water. By the time the crew realized it, it was impossible to rescue him because the river was deep and the water was rapid and the boats were crowded. Jiang was 38 years old and from Nantong. He had an old mother and wife at home who depended on Jiang for their livelihood. He had been the deputy fireman on the tugboat for only three weeks and was tragically killed. Afterwards, Dong Lu Qing, the manager of Bao Feng Fish Shop, feeling sorry for Jiang's family, donated 70 yuan to be used for compensation. He also reported to the Lifeboat Bureau, asking them to send patrol boats to try to recover the body. Until yesterday evening, the body had not been found.</p>

<p>Because Her Home Was Robbed Clean by Bandits</p>
<p>Weng Nianqu, the owner of Tong Feng Yong Silver Shop, located at the Parachute Ground, Nanjing Road, lived at No. 9 Weihe Lane, Zhao Fang Lane, West Gate, South City. Several months ago, he hired a maid from Luxu named Zhuang, about 40 years old. Yesterday morning at around 7:00, Zhuang suddenly hanged herself in the small room across from the kitchen of Weng's house. By the time someone noticed, she had been dead for a long time. Her body was cold to the touch. The matter was immediately reported to Chief Qian of the Second District, First Precinct of the Shenxiangge police station. Hearing the news, Chief Qian, considering it a matter of life and death, personally led Inspector Qiang Yude and Patrol Chief Wang Yufan to the scene for a detailed investigation. They saw a white cloth belt tied to the door of the deceased's bedroom. The deceased's neck also had a strip of cloth tied around it. According to Weng Nianqu, the deceased had not been here for long. However, when she first arrived, she claimed that her hometown of Luxu had been robbed clean by bandits and she often spoke of being weary of the world. The reason for her suicide was likely because of this. After finishing his statement, Chief Qian immediately ordered the local security to report to the court for inspection. At 4:00 in the afternoon, the court dispatched Prosecutor Guai, along with a clerk, to the scene to conduct a clear inspection. It was determined that she had committed suicide by hanging. He ordered the body to be handled by the corpse owner Weng Nianqu and ordered Weng to notify the Fang surname headman to promptly inform the deceased's family.</p>

<p>Resolved by a Joint Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Taxi Association held a general meeting at the Dengtuomo Hotel yesterday afternoon. Representatives from 57 companies including Yunfei, Lili, Tanle, Public, Global, Allenpas, Huishan, and Hui were present. During the meeting, Secretary Sheng Xiegui first reported on the association's affairs, saying that there were already 95 members this year, an increase of more than 40 companies compared to last winter, accounting for nine-tenths of all taxi companies in Shanghai. In the future, he hoped that members would work hard to introduce new members. Next, new staff were elected. Then, association affairs were discussed. It was said that recently, the expenses of each company, including house donations, correspondence, insurance fees, stamp taxes, etc., have been greatly increased. Now, tires and gasoline have also increased in price one after another. If the car rental is not increased appropriately, it is difficult to maintain business. It was resolved that, on the one hand, the car rental will be increased, and on the other hand, a cash payment system for car rental will be implemented to maintain the capital. The detailed method will be discussed by the association's committee. It is expected that the price increase method will be announced soon.</p>

<p>Comments on the Leprosy Relief Society</p>
<p>The *North China Daily News* said that leprosy is the most disgusting disease and many people do not want to mention it. However, the proper way is to take positive measures to make this fierce devil disappear permanently. Moreover, leprosy is not an incurable disease. If treated early, it can be completely eradicated. Therefore, we should do our best to assist institutions that provide leprosy relief, regardless of their size. Poor hygiene is the only cause of leprosy. The Chinese environment is the most suitable for the breeding of bacteria. (According to surveys, there are one million lepers in China.) In addition, frequent civil wars have made the government take no measures for leprosy. Not only are there no appropriate hospitals to accommodate patients, but there is also a lack of widespread publicity about the dangers of leprosy. Other things, such as isolating the children of patients and encouraging patients to seek medical treatment voluntarily, are beyond the reach of dreams. Therefore, under these circumstances, the work of eradicating leprosy depends on the promotion of enthusiastic people. The Chinese Leprosy Relief Society is dedicated to eradicating leprosy in China. Since its establishment, it has achieved remarkable results. Taking Shanghai as an example, it has spared no effort in investigating and treating patients, benefiting the sick greatly. It is also connected with the World Leprosy Relief Society, the American Leprosy Relief Society, the International Leprosy Alliance, and the Ministry of Health of the National Government. Branches have been established in Hong Kong, Fuzhou, and other places. Furthermore, the establishment of leprosy hospitals in various places is under planning. However, such undertakings require huge expenses. Without the concerted efforts of everyone, it is difficult to achieve success. We hope that people from all walks of life will provide practical assistance and not regard it as an ordinary organization.</p>

<p>Has Another Relationship with Another Girl</p>
<p>Acidity Causes Waves, and the Law Deals With It</p>
<p>Song Zhou, also known as Zhou Meiqing, a young woman from Haimen, 25 years old, lives in the Shanghai Yarn Factory residential area on Pingliang Road. In the spring of the 15th year of the Republic of China, she married Song Ganfei, also known as Song Lanhui, a fellow villager who worked as a car driver, through her parents' orders and a matchmaker's words. After marriage, they were initially harmonious. A few months later, Lanhui had a relationship with another young woman. Meiqing heard about it and caused a storm of jealousy. The couple then became estranged and did not come home to stay. Even if they met, they were like thorns in each other's eyes. During this period, Song Lanhui did not provide for the family. The woman had to work at the yarn factory, and the wages she earned were used to temporarily cover the household's needs. Recently, things have become even more intensified, with frequent quarrels and beatings. Yesterday, she hired a lawyer to deal with her husband through legal means. The purpose of the request is to demand cohabitation or compensation for corresponding living expenses. After the husband found out the bottom line, he also hired a lawyer to refute it. The two sides are currently in negotiations.</p>

<p>Body Still Needs to be Autopsied</p>
<p>Pan Ziqing, residing at 55 Seymour Road, loves gambling. His wife, Wang, tried to dissuade him, but he did not change. Sometimes, he even retorted. Wang, feeling extremely resentful, secretly ingested opium paste. The family noticed and sent her to Baolong Hospital. However, the poison had penetrated too deeply, and she could not be revived. She died at the hospital at 7:00 PM on the 4th. Pan took the body back, initially without reporting it to the police station. However, the hospital felt that it was inappropriate to conceal such a death, so it notified the Jing'an Temple police station by telephone. Detectives were dispatched to investigate Pan's home. Because Pan had avoided capture, the body was first taken to the Feilun Road autopsy room. Later, it was learned where Pan was hiding, so he was captured. Yesterday morning, Pan was taken to the autopsy room. Then, Prosecutor Guo of the Special District Local Court arrived at the room for an autopsy. He interrogated Pan, who confessed that the deceased was his wife and that she usually had heart pain. When she had an attack, swallowing soot would relieve the pain slightly. He had been out when she took it this time and did not witness it. Cai Wang, the sister of the deceased, also testified that her sister had not spoken to her before her death, so she did not know the cause of her death. However, soot was found next to the deceased, so it was known that she had taken poison. Prosecutor Guo said that whether Pan Wang's death was caused by poisoning should be determined by the court's forensic doctor and the hospital of the Public Works Department. The case was adjourned to Friday for further hearing. Pan Ziqing was temporarily released on 200 yuan bail.</p>

The day before yesterday (the 4th), Tian went to the company from his home to work on time. Unexpectedly, as soon as he entered the accounting room, he saw that the door was wide open, the iron chain had been cut, and the drawers on the desk had been opened. The iron door of the safe was wide open. Knowing something was wrong, he checked the miscellaneous items and found that two small silver boxes were missing, containing stocks, real estate deeds, and valuable jewelry, totaling about 15,000 taels. He immediately reported to the purchasing agent and notified the police station. The police chief, hearing the news, immediately led Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene for a detailed investigation. They all believed that it was done by someone familiar with the company, not an outside thief. They immediately investigated and found that Jin Hengcan, an employee in the accounting room with Tian, was a major suspect. He was immediately taken to the police station for questioning. Jin confessed the truth, saying that the stolen goods were hidden somewhere in the South City. The police station obtained the confession and immediately recovered the stolen goods. Fortunately, the time had not been long, and there were no losses. He was immediately ordered to be detained.</p>

They first fired a warning shot, then Head He, Team Leaders Pan and He, Chief Gao, Patrol Officer Shao, and Patrol Chief Wang Qikang bravely stormed the bandit den. They rescued abductee Zhu Jizhou on the spot. The bandits fled upon hearing the commotion, and they only captured the bandit's wife, Zhuang Wu, a bandit boat, and seized 20 rounds of ammunition for rapid-fire guns, a gray upper garment uniform, and green woolen jacket and trousers used by the bandits. They brought abductee Zhu Jizhou and others back to the corps headquarters. Under joint interrogation by Head He and Chief Gao, it was revealed that Zhu Jizhou, 57 years old, had been abducted during the bandit raid on Chonggu Town on the 23rd of last month.

<p>The Chunshen Canal has become increasingly silted up.

Wu Wenhua, the Director of the Shanghai Construction Bureau, dispatched technician Wang Kerou and a team to conduct the survey. The section within Shanghai County has now been surveyed, and Technician Wang returned to the bureau last night to report on the mission.</p>

<p>Twentieth Committee Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday at 4 PM, the Jiangsu Provisional Relief Association held its twentieth committee meeting in the back hall of the Renji Hall on 6th Avenue. Committee members Wang Yiting, Huang Boyu, Huang Hanzhi, Jiao Leshan, Ni Wenqing, Huang Ruisheng, Cheng Yiqing, and others were present, along with Ling Runsheng, a representative from the Yancheng Red Cross Society. Reported items: (1) Another 10,000 yuan in relief funds was remitted to Xinghua and Huai'an this week. (2) Director Liu telegraphed that bandits were rampant in Baoying East Township, making it too risky to travel there. The original plan to distribute funds on Yu Day has been changed to distribute them in the city on Yang Day. (3) Director Liu telegraphed that 6,600 households have been surveyed in Huai'an, requiring 27,700 yuan in relief funds. Please remit relief funds promptly. (4) Director Zhu telegraphed that 50% of Xinghua has been surveyed, and proxy surveys have not yet begun. (5) Chairman Wang Yiting and Committee Member Cheng Yiqing reported on attending the Provincial Relief Affairs Council meeting. It was resolved that the Finance Department would continue to allocate relief funds to various counties, totaling 68,300 yuan, to be handled by this association. (6) Amount of relief funds received this week. Matters for discussion: (1) The amount of insufficient relief funds for various counties, including the borrowed and advanced funds for Baoying, Yancheng, Liuhe, and Funing, totaled 24,700 yuan. After deducting the 6,500 yuan designated by the Provincial Relief Affairs Council for Liuhe, 4,500 yuan for Funing, 5,000 yuan for Baoying, and 4,500 yuan for Yancheng for reimbursement, there is still a shortfall of 4,200 yuan. How should this be repaid? Please make a resolution. Resolution: An additional 2,500 yuan will be advanced for the Baoying relief funds, and 2,500 yuan will be advanced for the Yancheng congee relief funds. Including the previous amount, a total of 9,200 yuan is still owed, and it will be divided among members to solicit donations for repayment. (2) How should the relief funds designated by the Provincial Relief Affairs Council for Huai'an, Jiangpu, Dongtai, Jiangning, Zhenjiang, Gaoyou, Xinghua, Jiangdu, Huaiyin, Jiangyin, Rugao, Liyang, Yixing, and Shuyang be distributed? Please make a resolution. Resolution: After the funds are allocated, the severity of the disaster will be assessed, and either additional relief funds will be raised and distributed by friends, or the funds will be handed over to the relief agencies in the respective counties for handling. Another meeting will be held to make a public decision. (3) Zhang Zhongkuan has been invited to handle relief affairs in Dingsha Township, Jiangyin. Should a survey and distribution bureau be established and a seal issued as usual? Please make a resolution. Resolution: Handle it as usual.</p>

<p>Dispatching Personnel to Shanghai to Handle Rice</p>
<p>Guangde, Anhui Province, has suffered from years of drought, and local rice production is no longer sufficient to meet its own needs. Last year, it was hit by natural disasters, with only 30% of the autumn harvest. The price of rice has risen to sixteen or seventeen yuan. The financial situation has further stagnated. Wealthy families have also exported rice in large quantities, depleting supplies. Poor people who relied on odd jobs and loans from wealthy families have no way to seek help, resulting in widespread starvation and rampant banditry. Recently, there were even over a thousand bandits besieging the county seat. Although reinforcements arrived promptly, the city was not captured. However, the people of the county have truly suffered from both natural and man-made disasters. It is said that Wen Jiyu and Wu Xingqing have been dispatched to Shanghai to transport rice for relief.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Xu Peikun's Relief Plan for the Silver Crisis (Continued) <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>(II) Application of the Law of Supply and Demand</p>
<p>Even if we apply the law of supply and demand to this crisis, as some people do, we can still see that some of the opinions expressed at the time were inaccurate. The reduction in the demand for silver is not only less than what some people claim due to the rapid increase in production and the significant decrease in demand, but in fact, production volume has been quite stable in recent years. India's demand for silver has not decreased to an alarming extent, and China's demand for silver has actually increased. A look at the following reliable figures (see Geng Aide's articles on page 6 of the Western Financial Weekly, January 29, 1930, and page 9 of February 6) will prove the above statement to be true.</p>
<p>Table of Shanghai Silver Imports (Average weight of each bar is one tael ounce)</p>
<p>1929: 102,043 (bars)</p>
<p>1928: 112,087</p>
<p>1927: 78,015</p>
<p>1926: 86,310</p>
<p>1925: 65,263</p>
<p>1924: 44,754</p>
<p>1923: 70,882</p>
<p>1922: 39,678</p>
<p>1921: 43,461</p>
<p>1920: 69,136</p>
<p>1919: 47,385</p>
<p>Table of Annual Silver Consumption by Indian Nationals</p>
<p>1929: 92,228,000 standard taels</p>
<p>1928: 70,25,0894</p>
<p>1927: 100,605,870</p>
<p>1926: 129,112,327</p>
<p>1925: 107,892,555</p>
<p>1924: 93,539,360</p>
<p>1923: 100,352,240</p>
<p>1922: 73,104,177</p>
<p>1921: 57,888,119</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 1930, the amount of silver used by China and India has further increased. Based on deductive reasoning, the decline in silver prices should not be so severe and should even rise. As for the price of silver bars, it is indeed set and announced by a few companies in London and New York City. According to the London silver price, the exchange rate parity on the Shanghai event is calculated. As mentioned above, therefore, most people mistakenly believe that the rise and fall of the Shanghai silver exchange rate depends on the fluctuation of the London silver bar price.</p>
<p>(III) Significance of International Exchange Rate Parity Calculation</p>
<p>In the case of gold pounds and silver taels, the most important thing to pay attention to is that when calculating the value of the currency of country B in terms of the currency of country A, the calculation method is to compare the weight of pure gold or pure silver contained in the two currencies. For example, the reason why the pound sterling parity is worth US$4.8665 is only because one US dollar contains 23.22 grams of pure gold, while one British pound contains 111.006 grams of pure gold. However, this kind of parity is by no means the reason for the rise and fall of the pound sterling or US dollar exchange rate. The relationship between Shanghai silver taels and London silver bars is similar to the above. In other words, the relationship between its formula or constant number is a calculation method. Using this method, we calculate the price of Shanghai silver taels with the known London silver price, using shillings and pence. It does not mean that the London silver price determines the Shanghai silver price. The reasons for determining the Shanghai silver price (and the London silver bar price) will be explained in detail below.</p>
<p>(C) The Truth about the Preciousness of Gold and the Cheapness of Silver</p>
<p>Since the occurrence of this problem, the problem is that there is too much empty talk. The most important thing is to understand the real reason for the rise and fall of the silver exchange rate. After understanding the truth, we can go on to seek remedies. Since the problem is complex, scholars must not be swayed by emotions or prejudices. We must deal with it calmly and analyze its state scientifically to gain a full picture of it.</p>
<p>(I) The Beginning of the Financial Crisis: First, let's review the situation when the silver exchange panic first started. The price of standard gold gradually rose last year, and by January 7 of this year, it had risen to a huge amount of 476 taels. At that time, the speculative community, the banking community, the business community, and other related parties showed signs of anxiety, but there was no major disturbance. Until January 8, the price of gold jumped from 476 taels to 496 taels, and then the live drama in the history of gold trading in Shanghai began. After the speculators' failure, they vigorously announced the secrets of standard gold manipulation, and the disturbances against speculation and the maintenance of the silver exchange rate also boiled over. If the price of standard gold had not soared so rapidly at that time (January 8), then the financial disturbances in this port would have been delayed or even indefinitely delayed.</p>
<p>(II) Application of the Principle of International Payment Rule</p>
<p>The key to the problem of standard gold and silver exchange rate is that the silver exchange rate is a reflection of the price of standard gold. The principle of international exchange rate is originally a very difficult and specialized theory, but the state of Shanghai silver exchange rate is even more complicated. According to the simple exchange rate principle, the Shanghai silver exchange rate should change according to the international payment rule, which is the same as the international payment between the two gold-using countries in the ordinary state. However, in the former case, in terms of abstract theory, raw silver is a commodity, and its gold value can also affect the Shanghai silver exchange rate. The application of the international payment rule to this problem is very obvious and does not need to be verified. In short, when our country should pay foreign countries, the silver exchange rate turns against it; conversely, when our country should receive foreign countries, the silver exchange rate turns smoothly. In addition to the smoothness and reversal of international payments as a major reason, there are also more powerful reasons that affect the silver exchange rate, that is, the long-neglected standard gold speculation and the East Exchange.</p>
<p>(III) The Influence of East Exchange on the Silver Exchange Rate: First, please examine the reason for the East Exchange. For several years, the East Exchange has often had a unique hegemonic influence on our country's silver exchange rate due to the relationship of standard gold speculation. Most of the standard gold speculation made for silver exchange rate and the speculation against the silver exchange rate only follow the lead of the East Exchange. When the East Exchange rises, it means that the price of standard gold rises and the silver exchange rate falls; conversely, the same is true. Although the rise and fall of standard gold can also reverberate to the East Exchange, its influence is insignificant compared to the influence of the East Exchange on standard gold. The above-mentioned phenomenon has been going on in China for many years, so our most reasonable conclusion is that the Shanghai silver exchange rate is controlled by the East Exchange, not by the London silver bar price. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<p>Sir, I saw in your newspaper's local news that Jiangbei native Li Mingliang organized a gang of thieves at 1058 Chengdu Road. After investigation, that number is the address of my client, the Renyi Yuan Factory. It was previously robbed, and the police found that a worker named Li Mingliang was the instigator. Therefore, he was arrested and sent for trial. I am concerned that this may affect the reputation of the Renyi Yuan Factory, so I am writing to request a correction. Your prompt attention would be greatly appreciated. Sincerely, Lawyer Chao Kun, May 6.</p>

<p>Modern women, before the age of twenty, have already eaten up the essence of love. So when they reach middle age, they feel that life is dry.</p>
<p>Almost every man can tell you how to marry a woman to be his wife. But no one can explain why he wants to marry her.</p>
<p>Don't judge a woman's nature and appearance by her soft voice on the phone, and don't judge a man's character after he has drunk a glass of iced wine.</p>
<p>Morality used to be a matter of geography, but now it is a matter of time. What was once considered a sin can now be called beautiful. What is now considered terrible may be a very fashionable act in the future.</p>
<p>Women like to recall past love and past dreams, while men like to guess at future happiness and future dreams.</p>
<p>Say this to newlywed friends: "Don't talk too much nonsense. Take more detours. Hurry home." [To people who have been married for a long time: "Wait a moment. There is wine and flowers here. Let's wait for future miracles."</p>

<p>Gu Tinglin of Kunshan was a man of extensive learning. His book, *Rizhi Lu*, is a great crystallization of our country's scholarship. It has been three hundred years since his death, but his legacy remains, and his great name has not diminished. Yesterday, a friend of mine told me about Mr. Gu's shoes. Although a small matter, it was quite interesting, so I recorded it to enrich this discussion.</p>
<p>The History of the Tomb: Mr. Tinglin's hometown was Qiandun in Kunshan, a place of beautiful scenery. Mr. Gu died in Gan and was never buried in his hometown. His descendants placed his clothes and hat in a coffin and buried him there. During the Xuan Tong reign of the Qing Dynasty, Prince Tutor Liang Dingfen came to Qian to pay respects to the public tomb. He repaired it and built four persimmon pavilions beside the tomb. It is said that Mr. Gu's former residence had four persimmon trees in the courtyard, hence the name was chosen to commemorate him. After the late Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China, there was no one to manage it, and the tomb and ancestral hall fell into disrepair.</p>
<p>The Style of the Shoes: Mr. Gu has a pair of shoes that still exist in his former home. The shoes are over a foot long, with a dull gray surface. The soles are damaged, the opening is quite narrow, and there is a lot of dust on them. Judging from historical speculation, this item is definitely not a common object. It is antique and quite different from ordinary items. Besides this, there is also a red silk shoe of similar size. Both are placed in a glass box.</p>
<p>Legends of the Lost Shoe: The relic is not unusual, but what is strange is that only one shoe remains. According to general rumors, it is said that Mr. Gu, when he died in Gan, specially sent this shoe back to show his descendants. Another theory is that Mr. Gu left it at home in a hurry to go out. The former theory is more credible, but there is no way to verify it. The truth is unknown.</p>
<p>The Origin of the Red Shoes: The red shoes, which are kept in the same container as the lost shoe, are another story entirely.</p>
<h3 id="e195">A Record of Receiving a Ring - He Tianjian <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>This is a record of Sun Xueni giving a ring to Zheng Wuchang. Wuchang is impulsive and irritable. If he disagrees with someone, he will argue. However, once the matter is over, he no longer cares. Wuchang always wants to repent and change, but he cannot. Recently, we had a dinner party at Nanyuan. During the meal, we talked about our views on life. Wuchang spoke highly of the wrongness of his temper. He repented of the past and wanted to warn himself in the future. This is the way of a gentleman. Xueni then took off his ring and gave it to him, saying, "Is it okay to wear this to warn you?" Everyone praised him and said, "Since it is to warn you, it must be done solemnly. How can we act lightly?" They pushed me to be the one to give the ring. I immediately performed the ceremony of giving the ring. Wuchang stood facing Xueni. I stood up and said, "It is admirable for a wise man to know his mistakes and repent. In the past, Ximen Bao wore Wei to restrain himself, so he warned himself against impatience. Now that you have received this ring, there must be an inscription. The inscription says: 'Wei means righteousness.' You should always remember it and examine it with it morning and night." After I finished speaking, I handed it to him with both hands. Wuchang bowed three times and received it. Everyone said, "Many people in this world are self-righteous when they make mistakes. Wuchang is not one of them. How can we not record this? You should write an article to record it." So, I took up my pen and wrote this record.</p>
<p>It is often criticized that the red silk shoe is not similar to the other shoe. However, there is a history to it. When the Nanyang Industrial Exposition was held in Nanjing, relics of ancient sages were collected extensively, including this shoe. Later, the descendants were afraid that this unique souvenir would not survive, so they made a new shoe in the same style to replace it. Later, the shoe was returned and kept with the original. Visitors can see the shoe. As the shoe is a historical souvenir, the Gu family stored it carefully and treasured it greatly. Outsiders can also expand their horizons by visiting with permission.</p>

<p>In recent years, bandits have been rampant. Residents in various places are living in anxiety. Even my small town (Sijing, Songyi) was robbed by a large gang of bandits twice last month. The details have been published in local news in various newspapers. Now, I will briefly describe the omissions below.</p>
<p>Disguised as Peddlers: Three or four days before the robbery, the bandits had already mixed into Sijing. They disguised themselves as peddlers selling "silk cotton quilts, foreign thread socks, calico, and children's sweets," etc., shouting in the streets and alleys. Secretly, they scouted the pawnshops and the homes of wealthy people in the town. At about 3 p.m. on the 28th, more than ten bandit ships suddenly arrived and anchored in the west of the town. The bandits landed and formed a team. They first</p>
<p>Fired Shots as a Demonstration: The bandits pre-ambushed as a signal. One bandit at the front carried a large red silk flag with the words "The World's First Army" written on it. They walked from the west market towards the east. At that time, they were spotted by a member of the defense corps on the West Bridge, who fired a shot and killed the flag bearer. The second bandit immediately stepped forward to hold the flag. The member fired another shot, and the second bandit also fell. The third bandit rushed up. The member fired another shot and hit him. Seeing the flag bearers fall one after another, the bandits swarmed to attack the defense corps in an attempt to rob them. Seeing the large group chasing them, the members hurriedly returned to the corps headquarters to report. At that time, the members were building a mud wall at the back door. Upon hearing the report, they each took their weapons and went out through the back door. The bandits had already chased in, and</p>
<p>Both Sides Opened Fire: They fought and retreated to the public sports field near the back of the town. After about an hour and a half of fierce fighting, the members ran out of ammunition, and the bandits who had been pre-ambushed in various places gathered. The situation became more rampant. The members had to retreat temporarily. Seeing that the defense corps was unable to resist, the bandits</p>
<p>Entered the Market to Rob: The robbery lasted about five hours. (The shops robbed and the losses have been detailed in various newspapers, so I will omit them.) At six o'clock, the bandits went to the west of the town to line up and call names. As a result, one person was missing. They re-entered the town and searched with whistles. After searching everywhere, they could not find him. The bandits then</p>
<p>Offered a Large Reward: One bandit held a stack of banknotes and shouted, "Third Brother, Third Master!" He ran wildly in the street. Another bandit cried and said, "If anyone finds Third Master, or finds his body, I am willing to reward 200 yuan." Later, it was increased to 500 yuan, but no one responded. As the weather gradually darkened, the bandits were afraid that the army would catch up and did not dare to linger. They hurriedly fled to the northwest. By the time the Songjiang army arrived in Si, the bandits had already fled far away.</p>
<p>Interesting Anecdotes After the Incident: This month's sixth day was the Catholic pilgrimage to Sheshan by Catholics. Therefore, more and more men and women from all over the world went to Sheshan to visit. One day was a holiday for the World Labor Day Commemoration. More than a dozen of my colleagues took advantage of the holiday to go to Sheshan to play. On the way, we passed through Sijing. We landed at the east market and went to the streets for sightseeing. At that time, the people in the town saw that they did not know more than a dozen people, and their accents were different. So, they started talking. The women who saw it said, "A group of strangers. I don't know what they are doing in Si." It had only been two or three days since the robbery. Seeing strangers, they were already panicked. They were really like startled birds.</p>
<p>This robbery was due to the fact that the authorities in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces recently joined forces to encircle and suppress bandits in the Taihu Lake area. The bandits fled east and west, choosing towns and villages without troops to rob. I hope that the magistrates of the various counties will also join forces to encircle and suppress them. If there is a bandit alarm in County A, County B must cooperate to apprehend them upon hearing the report. By joining forces and communicating with each other, the bandits will not succeed and will be easily wiped out. Merchants can also operate with peace of mind. The fact that Sijing was not devastated was all due to the strength of the defense corps. The members were only thirty or forty people, but they were able to fight against more than a hundred bandits. It was really not easy.</p>

<p>Lu, a retired gentleman from Shanghai, is a relative of Lu Zhongqi, the former Jiangsu Provincial Treasurer of the Qing Dynasty. He had been an official in Hubei for many years and accumulated a lot of wealth. He is over sixty years old and has two sons and five grandchildren. His wife, Mrs. Yang, is the same age as Lu. Last year, Lu suddenly thought of taking a concubine and discussed it with Mrs. Yang. Mrs. Yang agreed. It is understandable why he would be happy that an old tree would sprout. Lin, a man from Fujian, was living with them. He was an old friend of Lu and is now also a retired gentleman. They both rented a house. Lin is one year younger than Lu. His wife, Mrs. Zhu, is notoriously jealous. Even at banquets, if she finds out that there is a prostitute present, she will question him repeatedly and not allow him to go again. When Lin saw Lu take a concubine, he was very envious. One day, he boldly asked Mrs. Zhu if he could take a concubine, citing Lu's example and saying that the concubine could also serve Mrs. Zhu. Zhu did not allow it, saying, "You are old. Don't you want to live a few more years?" Lin could not get her permission, and the matter ended. Zhu also blamed Yang, saying that she was too muddleheaded. Later, Lu became ill from time to time. He died after only two years. Mrs. Zhu was literate and wrote a eulogy for her husband, which included the line, "Only then do I know that a jealous wife is a virtuous wife." Unfortunately, the narrator could not remember the entire eulogy. At this point, Lin also felt the virtue of Mrs. Zhu and often told people that he was not continuing Lu's legacy because of his wife. He said, "I am fortunate that my wife is unwilling to adopt an open policy." When I heard this, I said, "In the past, Emperor Wen of Sui always resented Empress Dugu's jealousy. Only after Empress Dugu died did the emperor dare to indulge himself in the concubines. Before long, his body failed. He lamented, 'If Empress Dugu were still alive, I would not be like this.' Although the emperor knew he was wrong, it was too late." I also heard that Yu Hong of Suzhou, a *juren* of the Guangxu Jiawu year, had no sons. After taking a concubine and having a son, his wife did not allow him to enter the concubine's room. She was also approaching sixty years of age at that time. After his wife died, there was no one to restrain him. He died not long after. Looking at this, a jealous wife is indeed a virtuous wife because she can protect her husband's health. However, for thousands of years, they have been unjustly accused of jealousy. How unjust!</p>

<p>The two Xu magistrates in our county are admired like an old couple. After sixty years of calamity, the dangerous city has been rebuilt. During the Xian Tong years of the Qing Dynasty, the Yue rebellion was raging. Magistrate Xu of Xiangxi (Magistrate Xu Xuemen Yaoguang) stood firm and defended the city. He repelled the Yellow Turbans. After the war, he resumed his duties and brought a withered county back to life. Even today, old men with white hair can still talk about it with tears in their eyes. Last year, war broke out again. The Qian Ge armies were again rampant. Zhejiang was suffering from frequent military communications and troop movement. The army was pressing on the west, and the quake was coming from the east. Zhuyang was at a strategic crossroads. Magistrate Xu of Wumen foresaw the danger and consulted the gentleman Wei Shen. He made an early plan to cut off the flue to prevent fire. The war became increasingly chaotic, and troops were stationed everywhere. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers from Zhu Ti were conscripted, and millions of bundles of hay were requisitioned. Everything was forcibly demanded, and the robbery continued until the end of winter. The land was crisscrossed by boundaries, and the corners of the chairs were used as landmarks in the conflicts. The Nine Passes were guarded by tigers and leopards, and the wilderness was occupied by foxes and rabbits. Roaming riders acted like Zhuang Qiao. They broke through walls and robbed roofs, searching chests and emptying cotton-padded jackets. Food was reduced to feed the soldiers, and even rough rice was not enough to eat. The generals' mansions were deep, and their ears were deaf to the cries of the people. Thousands of villages were evacuated, and people carried their families and infants. They trudged through ice and cold rain. They were lost in the fields, pushing and shoving each other in the mud. The villages were deserted, and the wind and dust obscured the view. In the bleak rain and snow, there was no dawn for hundreds of miles. Magistrate Xu said, "Do not be afraid. I will protect your safety." He was not afraid of their intimidating power and stood firm. In his calmness, he never wavered. In the midst of danger, how much humiliation did he endure? I live in the south of the city and gaze at the situation. I call him General Bo and cling to him like Liu Biao. On New Year's Eve, we stood together, surrounded by swords and spears. We dared to provoke the Asura's wrath, and a mutiny was only seconds away. We celebrated our survival, and the spring scenery was clear. Looking back on the aftermath of the pain, I feel a hundred emotions in my heart. We formed a pact and became friends like Guan Bao. In Chang'an, the game of chess is being played, and the actions are all chaotic. The jade is half-cut and sold for wine, and Yangcheng should be examined. You then hung up your documents and returned home, following the Zhushui and the Hongniao. People lined the roads to welcome you, old and young. We offer our heartfelt wishes to Zhu of Tongxiang and Zhao of the embroidered plain. The Goucheng is luxuriant, and the Huanjiang flows vast. The mountains are high and the waters are long, all praised by the Jiazao. The two Xu magistrates in our county are not praying for private blessings. Thousands of mouths will carve a monument to your achievements. We should cherish this fame as treasure. Also ask, sincerely seek. There are no other tricks. The upright officials are from Han Xijing. Who can compare to you without you? Fear the fortresses and celebrate Geng Sang, Xie Tiao of Qingshan. I will write this poem on New Year's Eve, and also record my lifelong friendship.</p>

<p>(5) Inspection of Tokyo</p>
<p>(A) Municipal Administration: Japan calls Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe the six major cities. Broadly speaking, Tokyo is a political district, Yokohama, Osaka, and Kobe are industrial and commercial districts, Nagoya (also known as Chukyo, the first capital of Japan) and Kyoto (also known as Kyoto, the former capital of Japan) are scenic districts. The municipal administration of these six major cities has made significant progress based on the relationship between region and personnel, and there is a constant eagerness for improvement. Tokyo, in particular, is the capital of Japan. After the great earthquake, the Japanese government established a Reconstruction Bureau under the Ministry of Interior to plan and implement national reconstruction projects. It also established a Tokyo Municipal Reconstruction Bureau to reconstruct the capital. It is making every effort to do so. When the reporter arrived in Tokyo, it was just as the city's reconstruction project had been successfully completed, and the Reconstruction Bureau was about to be abolished. The precision of its planning and the grandeur of its construction are vastly different from the progress before the earthquake. Therefore, carrying a letter of introduction from the Japanese Ministry of Interior, accompanied by Mr. Uchida Takeo, an interpreter from the Japan-China Association, and Miss Du Huairong, with a camera, I first went to the Tokyo City Hall (i.e., the City Hall) to visit and investigate. It happened that the city's Mayor, Mr. Hori Kiri Zenjiro, was visiting Kyoto for the Grand Shrine of Ise Grand Ceremony. (Kyoto is the former capital, so the Japanese government stipulates that all of the country's emperor's enthronement ceremonies and the Grand Thanksgiving Festival, i.e., the Grand Sacrifice Ceremony, are permanently held here. The ceremony is extremely grand.) The Chief Deputy Mayor, Mr. Shirakami Yūkichi, and Secretary Tanigawa Noboru, came out to meet us. The reporter inquired about the situation of Tokyo's municipal administration. According to the response, Tokyo is the capital of the country and has a special situation. There are many issues to be addressed. Now, I will list the circumstances of the answers to the questions and the facts of the personal visit in detail below. (1) Overview of the Organization of the Tokyo City Hall: Because of its status as the capital, the Tokyo City Hall has three assistant mayors under the mayor. (The assistant mayor is the deputy mayor.) Other cities have two assistant mayors. In addition to assisting the mayor, the assistant mayor is in charge of the bureaus and departments of the city hall. (A) First Assistant Mayor Shirakami Yūkichi is in charge of the Finance Bureau, the Electricity Bureau, the Accounting Division, the Audit Division, the Commerce and Industry Division, the Electricity Research Institute, etc. (1) The Finance Bureau has four divisions: Accounting, Revenue, Management, and Geography.

The director of the bureau is Mr. Mizo Masataro. (3) The Accounting Division has four sections: General Affairs, Payment, Revenue, and Recording. (A section is like a share in our country. One section is one share.) (4) The Audit Division has three sections: General Affairs, Audit, and Inspection. (5) The Commerce and Industry Division has seven sections: General Affairs, Industry, Finance, Slaughterhouse, the Central Market, the Retail Market, and Weights and Measures, as well as the Green Fruit Market and the Fish Market. (6) The Electricity Research Institute has three divisions: First, Second, and Third. (2) Second Assistant Mayor Tanaka Kotaro is in charge of the Social Bureau, the Education Bureau, the Health Bureau, the Nursery Home, the Secretariat, and the Documents Division, etc. (1) The Social Bureau has three divisions: Public Operation, Protection, and Employment, as well as the Neighborhood Welfare Center, the Work Training Center, and the Employment Agency. The director of the bureau is Mr. Yasui Seiichiro. (2) The Education Bureau has three divisions: School Affairs, Supervision, and Social Education, as well as the Teacher Training Institute and the Library. The director of the bureau is Mr. Fujii Toshitaka. (3) The Health Bureau has three divisions: Hygiene, Sanitation, and Parks, as well as the Hygiene Experiment Institute. The director of the bureau is concurrently held by the director of the Social Bureau. (4) The Nursery Home has four divisions: General Affairs, Guardianship, Medical Labor, and Management, as well as the Sugamo Branch, the Itabashi Branch, the Awa Branch, and the Inogashira School. The director of the home is Mr. Shibusawa Eiichi. (5) The Secretariat has one secretary-general and two secretaries. (6) The Documents Division has six sections: Documents, General Affairs, Regulations, Investigation, Correspondence, and Labor. (3) Third Assistant Mayor Hirose Hisanaka is in charge of the Water Bureau, the Civil Engineering Bureau, and the Reconstruction Bureau, etc. (1) The Water Bureau has six divisions: Water Supply, Water Purification, General Affairs, River Ports, Sewage, and Construction, as well as the Wharf Office. The director of the bureau is Mr. Konda Shinzaburo. (3) The Reconstruction Bureau has three divisions: Facility Construction, Construction Work, and General Affairs, as well as the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Branch Offices. The director of the bureau is Mr. Fukuda Shigeyoshi. The above bureaus and divisions, except for the Reconstruction Bureau, are all permanent institutions. There are also fifteen ward offices under the City Hall (like the current district offices in our country). The ward chiefs, under the direction of the mayor, are responsible for managing the affairs of their respective wards. The organization, evolution, and current situation of the ward system will be discussed in a separate article.</p>

<p>Up 2.9 taels</p>
<p>The gold price rebounded yesterday, with only half a day of trading in the morning session. The premium rose to a high point, fluctuating around 3 taels. The foreign exchange rate initially eased but then tightened. HSBC's quoted rate was long in the morning but then shortened. Demand exceeded supply among dealers, and the market was bullish. Zihfeng Yong, Dadecheng, and Yuancheng Yong were keen to buy, while Shunli, Wanxing, and Yuanmaoyong were selling short positions. The large bars were also long in the morning, so they fell slightly, then hovered around 504 taels. The difference was almost one tael. Later, both official and unofficial foreign exchange bills were bullish. The near-term Japanese gold was calculated at 1.06375, and the British gold was only 0.109375. By noon, the trend was gradually upward, reaching 507 taels. Buyers became more active, and British silver bars rose by 1/16, while silver prices also increased by 1/4. The exchange rate was as before. At the beginning, the trend was slightly lower, hovering around the June premium opening at 504.1 taels, slightly down 0.02 taels. However, the gross price suddenly fell, fluctuating by about 1 tael. Wanxing, Shunli, and Dadecheng all entered, while Yucheng Yong and retail investors exited.

The highest price during the half day was 507.2 taels, and the lowest price was 03.6 taels, a difference of 3.6 taels. The opening price was 4 taels and closed at 7.2 taels.

<p>Cotton Yarn Sales Exceptionally Smooth in Guangdong</p>
<p>The yarn market is generally sluggish and weak. The unstable political situation prevents merchants from actively purchasing goods. However, the clearance of stagnant inventory has calmed sellers, who have no intention of aggressively pushing up prices. A certain factory's bullish position remains unchanged. Both sides maintain their positions. Sales of yarn to Guangdong are slightly more active. The current market remains in a fluctuating state.</p>
<p>Futures yarn prices vary. Before the opening bell, with strong actual sales the previous day, market sentiment was excited, and individual investors aggressively bought up stock. However, buyers were not enthusiastic, and prices rose slightly by one, two, or three qian in each month. In the afternoon, some bullish investors sold to close out their positions, and the market weakened again. However, trading volume remained healthy. Prices then fell by one, two, four, or five qian. Total daily trading volume was estimated at 5,900 bales. The closing prices at the opening bell are listed below:</p>

<p>Spot Yarn Prices Rise Slightly, Sales are Still Good, Guangdong Remains Interested. Total daily sales to all merchants were 1,145 bales, with 300 bales traded among fellow merchants. Prices were slightly firmer. Guangdong merchants made the largest purchases among non-local merchants, accounting for 660 bales. In addition, Xiamen purchased 30 bales, Sichuan purchased 40 bales, inland areas purchased 210 bales, Yunnan purchased 40 bales, Xuzhou purchased 70 bales, Wuhu purchased 10 bales, Youtou purchased 35 bales, and Qingdao purchased 30 bales.</p>

<p>The cotton market was initially firm but then weakened, with the overall situation softening. Due to rumors that Japanese Dongmian would be delivering this month, market sentiment was weak. However, the Han merchants remained calm and continued to purchase long-term contracts. The situation in the cotton market has become even more chaotic.</p>
<p>Futures Cotton Rises and Falls. Before the Han Standard opening, the No. 1 brand purchased an additional 1,000 dan of the current month's contracts, causing the market to rise by 2.5 qian. Long-term contracts fell or rose by 1.5 qian. In the afternoon, No. 18 continued to sell, totaling approximately 6,000 dan in both sessions, causing the market to soften again. Prices fell by 0.5 to 1.5 qian in each month. Total daily trading volume was 22,100 dan. The closing prices for the Han Standard are listed below:</p>

<p>Silk and Tea: Spring Races Make the Silk Market Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the Spring Races in Shanghai. Foreign firms followed their usual practice of closing early in the afternoon for the holiday. Silk merchants only had half a day of business in the morning. Overseas silk sales were stagnant, and there were no telegrams from overseas regarding silk. European and American firms were passive. Senior staff members were away on vacation, further depressing the silk market. There were no reported transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Scarce Leases for Xiaoshao Cocoon Firms <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>This year, due to unrest in Xiaoshan and Shaoxing, farmers reduced the number of silkworms they raised. Only households near the city and towns continued to raise silkworms. The silkworms are currently feeding on the best mulberry leaves. Improved silkworm breeds have not been significantly affected, but native breeds have been largely abandoned due to unfavorable weather conditions. There are few silkworms, but ample leaves. Mulberry leaf prices are generally only 1.50 or 1.60 yuan. In previous years, cocoon firms in the area would have already been fully leased. Staff would have arrived with funds to prepare for the opening of cocoon buying. This year, due to ongoing banditry, silk and cocoon merchants are hesitant. Few cocoon firms have been leased. Statistics show that less than 10-20% of the cocoon firms in Xiaoshan and Shaoxing have been leased. The reduced activity in the cocoon market this year is distressing.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Qifu Red Tea Stalled <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Since the Qifu new red tea gardens opened in recent days, tea production has been slow and often suspended due to cloudy and rainy weather, which increases the time required for farmers to harvest and process tea. Yesterday, new tea from the Fulu area was opening at a price of 60 yuan per dan, while Qilu tea was higher, at 12 yuan, similar to last year. However, most of the major tea companies that typically fix prices at the river ports have not yet gone into the mountains, making it difficult to open the market. As a result, while prices for new tea from mountain farmers and upper estates can be lowered, tea companies cannot afford to take the risk. The Qifu tea market is virtually stalled.</p>
<h3 id="e210">After Opening New Tea Sales, British Companies Suddenly Hesitate <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local Shanghai foreign-owned tea market and tea factories exhibited a small amount of new samples of precious eyebrow green tea at tea warehouses. British company experts began to hesitate. Besides the precious eyebrow tea sale agreed upon the other day, there were no other business openings.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Dexing New Tea Heard to be Weighed <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>This year's Dexing new green tea was harvested early because of earlier weather and quiet bandit areas. In the past two days, the new tea in the area of ​​Xinjiang, Huangjiajian, Shanling and Suyao has been collected in small amounts by tea vendors, and sold at a price of five corners per catty. Mountain farmers sell as soon as they collect and do not store it at all. Although the price is low, they are willing to sell first (April 29).</p>
<h3 id="e212">Tunxi New Tea News <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Tunxi tea market has become increasingly lively in recent days. There have been more than 60 tea houses and companies that have organized openings. The mountain farmers are currently busy with harvesting, and the harvest will not be very low. However, because Tunxi City suffered from bandit disasters last year, and tea merchants also suffered losses, the vitality of the city was severely damaged. In addition, Shanghai tea warehouses are extremely strict with releasing money to Tunxi, resulting in tight money and difficult operations. Currently, only Dafang Garden Tea in various new tea markets in Tunxi has opened for 80 yuan per dan. Other prices have not yet been determined.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Food: Rice Market on the Lower River Varies in Strength <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Medium and Secondary Rice Continues to be Generally Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, few rice boats from the interior arrived in Zhabei. However, there were active stockpiles on the Lower River, so market sales still did not improve. Due to thin supply and sales of North Gang's top grade white japonica rice at both production and sales sites, cargo owners are reluctant to lower prices due to cost considerations. However, medium and secondary grade japonica rice stocks are large, and sales are sluggish. Only the newly arrived top and medium grade japonica rice are slightly active, while other transactions are light, leading to price reductions. Thin paddy rice arrivals were weak, demand was dull, and the trend continues to be weak. However, the true top grade goods must be outside the 19 yuan customs. Yangxian is stable. Dujian rice follows the movement of foreign rice. Because the flow of scarce goods is rare, buyers do not pay much attention. There are few changes in the overall market. White yuan rice is in high demand, while lower grades are stagnant, indicating a tendency to raise the price of higher grades and suppress the price of lower grades. Overall trading volume was extremely light.</p>
<p>More than a dozen boats arrived at Hunan Inner Road. The buying interest on this street was extremely quiet. Only the Chang Gang high-quality rice was stable. The sales of common japonica rice from Xibang were slow. However, the market price can still be maintained. Sutong machinery japonica rice is mostly numb. Because of few high-quality and many low-quality rices, customers are unwelcome. There will have to be a difference of one corner on the rise and fall of the market price. On the surface, it still seems flat. Buyers of South Gang's thin early paddy rice are generally watching because they do not want to stockpile it at this time of year. Foreign rice is also suppressing the local market, which is especially not enjoyable. The market situation is the most sluggish. Foreign Duji and other points, except for South Gang, have also arrived sporadically in Tongli and other places. Since customers have foreign rice in hand, their desire to consume local rice is poor, and the overall market feels dull and soft. Changes are subtle and the situation is very weak. Transactions are scarce and the price for high-quality rice is strong, while the price for lower grades is weak.</p>
<h3 id="e214">The Key to the Flour Market Remains in the Weather <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Predicted Wheat Harvest to be Above 80%</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a flat and weak trend. Although North's sales of flour will be good this month, manufacturers such as Fufeng and Fuxin do not have consistent attitudes, so even though the trend is good, some people remain hesitant. As for the long-term futures, the weather is sunny, and the climate is favorable, so market sentiment has softened. According to industry insiders, if this type of weather does not change within half a month, then this year's wheat harvest should be above 80%, an increase of 20% compared to previous years. Therefore, the key to this year's new wheat harvest will depend on the situation within the month. As a result, this month's price was slightly smaller than the previous day's by five li. Each of the months of June, July and August were lower by one fen. The September was smaller by one fen and two li, and the October was also lower by seven li.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Large-Scale Activity by Short Sellers in the Wheat Market <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>It is Difficult for Xibang Bulls to Maintain Their Position</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of wheat futures fell sharply across the board. Foreign wheat was reported to be lower by one or two jiao, and the weather was very good. The situation, which had previously seemed to favor maintaining the position, has been influenced by the weather. The rain on the ground is related to the abundance or lack of wheat, and the possibility of the price of this new wheat falling exists. Therefore, in both the morning and afternoon sessions, the selling of new short sellers was intense. Those who wanted to maintain a firm bullish position were only from Xibang. However, the environment was unfavorable, and the prices were slightly lower. As a result, the price of wheat for June fell by four cents compared to the previous day, July by two cents, August by two cents, and September and October by three cents. Spot wheat remained flat, as sales and deliveries were evenly matched, and there was little fluctuation. Anqing and Hankou wheat was sold for 4.32 to 4.07 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Foreign Rice Sales are Sluggish and Prices are Down Slightly <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the demand for foreign rice turned light, and a new ship arrived, making the market situation quite soft. In addition, after Hankou helped with sales previously, there was no continuation. Among the Yangtze River route, customers such as Jiangxi and Anqing inquired, but in small numbers. Other customers only handled a small amount. In total, there were just over 6,000 bags of rice opened, and the price was lower than the previous market by a small corner. Transactions included 200 bags of Saigon rice at 15.55 yuan, 500 bags of high grade No. 2 at 14.9 yuan, 3,000 bags of small machine rice at 14.75 yuan, 300 bags of large machine rice at 14.6 yuan, and 2,000 bags of Annam japonica rice at 16 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Soybeans and Bean Cakes are Weak <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the standard soybean and bean cake markets were sluggish, and even the prices went downstream. The market atmosphere for selling was stronger, but because the road price of shipping soybean was cheap, the transportation was not worth it, so the current sales of soybeans were particularly sluggish. A small amount of soybeans were consumed by small firms and some oil factories along the street, so the price was stable. The June futures price fell three or four points because of the selling of a number of companies.</p>
<p>The transit sales of bean cake were also stagnant, and actual trading was quiet. The opening price in the morning was down a little bit. Prices took a short step downward during the market, and in the end, near-term contracts were down one point and long-term contracts were down around one and a half points.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Falling prices of cotton goods, both domestic and foreign <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>The local cloth market fell yesterday. No matter coarse cloth, fine twill, or fine cloth, all fell by two and a half fen, which is really because passenger sales stagnated, and the quietness of the Yangtze River is unprecedented, so the 13-pound coarse cloth is in a state of collapse. Fine cloth still sold a few pieces by Luan Double Fish yesterday for six taels and eight qian. The price was sold at seven taels and two qian for Yihe blue striped bleached cloth, which was three qian lower than the opening price. Because the Yuxia Gang has reached the point of lowering the price, there is not much purchase.</p>
<p>The prices of oriental and western fabrics have mostly fallen, and there are fewer increases. Actual sales are quiet. After examining the reasons, it is nothing more than the unrest in the current situation, and the stagnation of the various gangs. In addition, the annual harvest last year was poor. The Zhenjiang and Wuhu gangs have not yet recovered to their original state, and the off-season is approaching, so it will be difficult to change in the short term. Yesterday, the price of straight-tribute neizi of oriental goods has fallen back to two and a half li. Mo Gan Mountain heard of two qian, six fen and seven li and a half, and La Hui was two qian and six fen and a half. Four scholars of blue striped satin have sold one qian and six fen. The purplish golden mountain is one qian, six fen and two li and a half. After the bleached cloth was once lively, the sales were also quiet, only the white crepe cloth and Yuan yang yarn were still being sold daily. Western goods such as skirt yarn and Bonao yarn are also plummeting, and the price has fallen by one or two fen per yard. Blue-striped masha is also soft.</p>

<h3 id="e225">Small Contributions to Increase Business by Cheng Zhizheng <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>When a salesperson has two or three hundred clients, there are two ways to look at it. It can be seen as a tedious chore, or it can be seen as a gold mine. If the gold mine is mined properly, there will naturally be good returns. Otherwise, the result will certainly not be good. For example, if there are three hundred customers, there are three hundred cars that need to be serviced every month, whether it's lubrication, washing, or tire and battery replacement. The work is very intense.</p>
<p>Among the three hundred clients, some tend to forget the service period. Therefore, salespeople should think of ways to notify them and attract their attention. Success or failure hinges on this. From an economic point of view, there are several new scientific methods worth introducing for agile service.</p>
<p>(1) Reminder slips are the latest style, and they are already being used in many places. The method is to stick a printed slip on the car's speedometer, which clearly states the various requirements, such as how many miles to drive before refueling, how many days to wash, and other common knowledge. In this way, the car owner can be alerted at any time when turning off the car and will not forget. The price of this kind of reminder slip is very low, and the beauty lies in this point, and the function is great. However, many car owners do not like to stick paper on the car, but now the reminder slips are printed very beautifully, and the car owner can use them as a kind of decoration. If they really don't want to, they can stick them underneath.</p>
<p>Postcards are the second inexpensive method. When the repair period for a certain customer arrives, you can notify them with a postcard. When he sees the postcard, he will of course come. Some people advocate that salespeople print a special kind of postcard, which must be special, otherwise it will be unclear.</p>
<p>On the contrary, it is not good. This is indeed true. It is best to print some colored ones, which will be more meaningful. Now there are also machines used to manage photos automatically. For example, if a certain customer needs to repair on that day, make a mark on that day, and when that day arrives, it will naturally fall down, and you can mail it immediately without forgetting. (3) Letters Letters are more expensive than postcards. The printing paper costs two cents per letter, and three hundred letters per month cost six yuan. Adding postage is even more alarming. However, letters also have one advantage, which is that they are more formal than postcards and are easily valued. The effect is also great. Although the price is high, judging from the harvest, writing letters is also worthwhile.</p>
<p>(4) Telephone The telephone is another step further. Direct communication with the customer is more direct than writing a letter. When a person receives a letter, he can stuff it in his pocket or even discard it. Perhaps after reading it, he forgets it due to being busy. This is a common occurrence. Now that you can talk to him directly, he will naturally pay special attention, and the degree of forgetting will naturally be much less. Moreover, customers with telephones are relatively richer and can take advantage of this to do other transactions. However, the only difficulty with telephones is that the cost is too high. Some telephone bills are calculated monthly, and some are calculated by the number of times. If calculated by the number of times, the burden is even heavier. However, if the effect is great, this small fee is naturally not a problem. Telephones can not only increase trade, but also assist in the shortcomings of postcards. If you do not receive it or forget to receive it, you can urge it by telephone. The two impressions are deeper and will never be forgotten again. Telephone calls are also very cost-effective when business is slow. If calculated monthly, business is naturally not a problem when busy. Now, don’t ask if the telephone is expensive or not, just ask if the work is efficient. If the efficiency is checked, the telephone bill is not a problem.</p>
<p>In short, after a salesperson sells a car, he must also pay attention to service. To provide service, you must always pay attention to the customer's period of need. When the period arrives, you must notify him. First, maintain your own business and avoid being snatched by others. Second, it is also a kind of goodwill towards the customer. To maintain this kind of business, the four methods mentioned above are all new and desirable. Because it is more difficult for customers to come to the door themselves, use reminders to make customers pay attention to themselves, and use postcards, letters, and telephones to urge customers to pay attention. Therefore, the former is automatic, and the latter is passive. The last is to advance on both sides, then the effect will be more significant. Finally, I can say that things are done by people. When he is a gold mine, he can naturally profit. When he is an annoyance, failure is undoubtedly. In addition to the above methods, a person must also have patience and perseverance. If he can do this, success is not a problem.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Fisk Tires that Turn Danger into Safety <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Rough and arduous journeys are no different from flat ground</p>
<p>Recently, two Peruvians and two Chileans made a car trip. All that has been passed through has been unprecedented. They set off from Santiago, Chile on the morning of September 16. They lived in a Packard car equipped with Fisk tires. They opened mountains and made roads. Giant rocks and boulders were everywhere. The view was desolate. It was a barren land.</p>
<p>What is called a road is actually a tooth-like rock. The tire goes through it, and the disaster is unavoidable. When the tire was manufactured, it did not initially undergo this kind of test to determine its needs. After this amazing test, Fisk wheels have further proved that their tires are manufactured with experience that matches the name. The slope of the car’s path ranges from 40 degrees to 50 degrees, and the ascent from the horizontal line varies up to 7,000 feet. As for the height of the caves and the strangeness of the rocks, they are all on the way, not included in the calculation. Once, the car they were driving suddenly got stuck in a mud pit. Later, it was pulled out of danger by two ox carts. Another time, because the crane could not bear the weight of the entire car Above is a group photo of Mr. Freeman, manager of the China Automobile Company, and Mr. Zhou Mengxian, Chinese manager. Mr. Zhou is young and knowledgeable, quick to act, kind in nature, and widely traveled. All the important figures in the political and business circles are happy to associate with Zhou. He has been serving the company for thirteen years. The company's business can be flourishing, and Mr. Zhou and others have manpower.</p>
<p>Instead of walking, they passed through the center of the Andes Mountains and reached the city of Lima, Peru on October 17. This trip's adventures and unexpected encounters are truly beyond everything. The endurance of human beings belongs to the passengers, the endurance of the car belongs to the machinery, and the durability of the material belongs to the tires.</p>
<p>It is obvious and undoubted.</p>
<p>The entire journey was rugged and uneven, almost impossible to walk an inch. There are deep valleys, mountain peaks, and cliffs. The deepest ones are about 10,000 feet. The climate is also extremely different, ranging from freezing point to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. However, the group of four was able to escape the danger. It can also be said to be dangerous. Anyone who slightly imagines the dangers that these digital drivers have passed through will be amazed. Most of the roads traveled have been measured. Falling onto a barge, when it fell from above, the front right wheel of the car was hitting the side of the barge. The entire weight of the car was pressing on the wheel, but the tire did not burst. The result was that the car body overturned.</p>
<p>The most difficult part of the entire journey was the section through the Atacama Desert. This desert is no different from the Sahara of South America. In the 700-kilometer journey, the water source was cut off. If there is any mistake in human beings or machinery, there is no way to call for help. They passed through this hot sandy land as if in a natural furnace. The terrible hot sun made people thirsty and hot. completely despair. If the car is damaged or the tires are broken, the danger to life is inevitable.</p>
<p>All the difficulties mentioned above and others can be expressed.</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>. I know that in countries around the world, there are several machines every day. Devote your heart and soul to solving various obstacles in car driving. Today, all beings in the world can cross barren and dangerous places as if walking on a flat avenue, with the convenience of safety and comfort. Today's construction should meet the needs of the future.</p>

<h3 id="e229">The Question of Passenger Safety on Buses by Zhuo <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Not long ago, Shanghai newspapers reported on a bus overturning on Jiangwan Road, crushing a ticket seller to death and injuring passengers. This means that the safety of bus passengers is worth discussing and consulting. To ensure the safety of passengers, drivers should first be properly trained. Inexperienced drivers are prone to accidents. This can be seen from the recent case of a certain gentleman running over a certain doctor. However, the responsibility for the misfortune of a bus overturning cannot be placed solely on the driver. Why? Please briefly discuss it.</p>
<p>The quality of the bus's construction has a great impact on the safety of the bus's operation. According to Percival White, an American automotive industry expert, the center of gravity of the bus is related to the overturning of the bus. Most people think that double-decker buses are easier to overturn than single-decker buses. This is not entirely the case. Whether the bus is single-decker or double-decker, its speed should not exceed the maximum limit. Otherwise, the center of gravity of the bus cannot be reduced, and the misfortune of overturning occurs. According to Mr. White, the bus's engine must be flexible. The brake is the convenient way to stop the bus. Many buses, especially public buses, often have various internal mechanisms that are not very flexible due to insufficient consideration of the price. I once asked on the Yuhang bus road. There have been many times when the bus overturned. The reason is that it could not be arbitrarily braked when encountering turns. And the reason why it cannot be arbitrarily braked is mostly because the brake is not flexible. Mr. White said that the failure of the bus to overturn is due to the fact that the arc line cannot be shortened when . This is also related to the road and is not solely the responsibility of the bus's construction.</p>
<p>Also, bus overturning accidents occur more often with buses that solicit passengers (commonly known as "wild chicken buses"). This is because their buses are mostly old and dilapidated. Perhaps, cracking down on old and dilapidated buses is also an item that should be paid attention to by the municipal government.</p>
<p>To Yi Huangdai, Jiren, Ding Zuze, Jia, Ruolan, Lin, Xu Meilie, Sanyuan, Qu Zi, Cheng Zhizheng, Song, Zhuo, Trumpet, , Mei, Gentlemen: The royalties for April have been calculated.
