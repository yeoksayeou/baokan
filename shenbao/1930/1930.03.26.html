<h3>日本徘徊中之兩問題</h3>
<p>日本自發現工商業衰落現象後。當局覺悟長此緊縮之非計。有捨棄消極轉取積極政策之議。然欲實施積極。又須有充分財力。今債旣難借稅又難增財源無從開發。則財政又安能積極整理。於是對於財政。遂徘徊於支持消極與改換積極二者之中。</p>
<p>海會中自美國提出妥協案。經若櫬代表請示後。日外務省有稍加遷就之意。海軍省爲國防計。則以爲非堅持原案不可。内閣當局以内部之主張。旣未一致。而外觀海會之情勢。各國又皆相持不下。不得不稍取觀望熊度。於是對於海會遂亦徘徊於堅持原案與遷就妥協二者之中。</p>
<p>斯二者一關於全國生計前途。一關於國防軍事前途。安危利害皆甚鉅大。誠不能不稍加鄭重。然以旁觀者言之斯二事之安危利害。息息相通。可以聯併爲一問題。一解决而雙方俱可解决。何以故。今日欲以積極政策挽救工商業之頽勢。所難者財政上無法整理耳。與其枝枝節節以搜括之减省之。而仍無補。則孰若謀節縮於大宗支出之軍費。欲達節縮軍費之目的。則莫若對於海會。稍稍遷就讓步。日美間如能圓滿解决。或可因此引動其他各國之誠意。各表示讓步使此危如累卵之海會。竟能轉換局面。得實現和平希望。亦未始不可能之事我無侵人之心。人自無攻我之念。猜忌悉除。則非特海軍費可省。陸軍費亦可由此節减。移此鉅欵。以用之於整理財政。挽救工商業之頽勢。可决其必獲相當成績。而不至如今日之束手無策。果能如是。則不僅日本自身之兩難題。可以解除世界亦且蒙其福利。否則議會一旦破裂勢必與各國競爭造艦。擴充軍備。增加軍費。以重人民負擔。究其結果。人民生活之困難。工商之衰敗。財政之無辦法。或且較今日之現象爲更甚。特未知徘徊不决中之日當局。亦有幾微之念覺悟及此歟。</p>

<h3>海會依然停頓</h3>
<p>意代表有提議休會兩月說</p>
<p>路透社二十五日倫敦電　報稱、有人提議英美日之三强恊定、應行締結、而海會至此可休會兩月、法意兩國政府在此兩月中、應設法謀取和平諒解、並擔任同時不再造艦云、又電、聞報紙所載之提議、乃意外相格蘭第所提出、</p>
<p>路透社二十五日倫敦電　海會今日之地位未有變動、現仍以五國協定爲討論之基礎、至今晨所傳休會兩月之建議、乃姑先提出、以備某種情勢發生時考慮之、然目下此種情勢、尚未發見也、代表團主任、今日午後五時三十分曾集議考慮大會之全局、四月五日英倫與蘇格蘭比賽足球、足球聯會邀請海會代表參觀、代表泰半接受此項請柬、殊値注意也、</p>
<p>路透社二十四日倫敦電　英海軍大臣亞歷山大今日在倫敦演說、謂海會無悲觀理由、不獨未失敗、且在某方面頗可望有切實進步、英相現竭力運動五强協定、與會諸國皆承認英國贊助之誠意、各國旣皆有反對戰爭之莊嚴宣言、則專爲軍縮而來倫敦之各代表、何致不能成立一種協定云、</p>

<p>日回訓付閣議討論</p>
<p>日聯社二十五日東京電　日本政府覆若櫬全權之回訓、於二十五日閣議席上、由幣原外務大臣詳細報告外務省之意見、（係以已經海軍元帥軍事參議官會議承認之海軍省所擬之回訓案爲基礎者）、各閣僚先後陳述意見、卒以海軍省外務省兩方面當局、有二三重要點、尚未完全一致、以致未曾决定、結局似將一任首相外相主持也、</p>
<p>東京各報之論評</p>
<p>電通社二十五日東京電　本日東京各大報、論軍縮會議最近事情、時事新報曰、殘存日美間之問題、爲大型巡洋艦三隻如何處理之一點、但絶對不可承認、美國有保留由十五隻增加三隻之權利、因此違反軍縮之根本精神也、東京朝日新聞曰、法意兩國之關係、姑置勿論、惟日英美三國、宜使此次軍縮會議成功、不僅爲政治的協定、且須於太平洋永遠之和平、關係、經濟的協力、對華外交等廣泛的意義、締結日英美親善關係、會議或因此延長、决不足慮、須努力取得實績、不必拘泥會議期間之長短也、國民新聞曰、美國爲和緩日本之七成要求起見、提議承認日本在中國及太平洋西部之優越權、日美間之交涉、似已大有進展、美國之此提議、於促進和平、有實質的大效果云、中外商業新聞曰、最近日美間、關於遠東安全保障之交涉、已具體化、關於中國問題、日美間成立諒解、美國方面已積極的提議、承認日本之優越的地位、因此日本對軍縮態度、已有幾分和緩之觀、</p>
<h3>英下院　辯論陸軍預算案</h3>
<p>路透社二十五日倫敦電　陸軍預算案今日在下院辯論、至今晨二時、預算案始成立、保守黨議員賀渥斯問新加坡用費减少、是否政策有更變之表示、陸軍部財政秘書答稱、政府改變政策、已屬無欵、因新加坡工作現不急於進行也、賀渥斯又問工程有無取銷之處、抑僅延緩工作、財政秘書答稱、有數種費用業已取銷云、</p>
<p>路透社二十四日倫敦電　陸軍大臣邵氏今日在下院提出一九三○年陸軍預算案、共四千萬鎊、比較去年節省六十萬五千鎊　邵氏聲稱、英國陸軍陸續减少至十四萬八千人、政府不欲於未有國際恊定時再行裁减云、邵氏言及在華加駐軍隊之額外費用、謂英政府對華政策、在同情的注視中國植立其自已政體之努力、英政府將以友好的方法會同他國行動、以謀取在自治的中國境内外僑之安全云、邵氏又謂印度人民三萬萬、而駐於印度之英兵僅六萬人云、辯論時、工黨左翼議員柯夫提出修正案、謂所有軍事準備、皆屬糜費、徒爲資本家帝國主義服務、故要求英國陸軍每年大加裁减之政策、並要求立即停止維持義勇訓練隊與士官隊之國給經費云、但此修正案爲二七四票對二一票所否决、前任陸軍大臣艾文斯稱、馬來由今年捐助九萬二千鎊、紐絲綸捐助二萬九千鎊、充新加坡軍港經費、現在所費僅三萬三千鎊、故陸軍部可得八萬八千鎊以供經常陸軍費云、</p>

<h3>所謂朝鮮自治案</h3>
<p>非韓人之自治</p>
<p>實日人之自治</p>
<p>日當局欺騙韓國民衆</p>
<p>韓京特訊、朝鮮總督齋藤實、鑒於近來韓人解放運動非常猛烈、揚言韓人地方自治之必要、向日内閣提出地方自治擴張案、業已通過、不日即將宣布實施、韓人各界對此、一致反對、查其自治案内容、在府·道·及羣·各設協議會、此種機關、於名義上爲議决機關、而其實不外乎總督政治之傀儡、各協議會長、由現職知事及府尹充任、一般行政官吏、則有所謂監督權、其權限極廣、﹁有取消違法及不當之議案、曁停止及解散會議之權﹂、換詞言之、各協議會苟以大多數票决一案、知事及府尹可擅自取消、反之、議員無彈劾議長之權、又各協議會中官選議員、定全體議員三分之一、至議員之資格、以每年繳納國稅五百元以上者爲限、其自治决議實施之地域、則限於城市地方、凡此皆限制韓人之參與、以便日人占絶對多數、結果所謂朝鮮自治、非朝鮮人之自治、實爲居住朝鮮之一般日人之自治而已、（世界社）</p>

<h3>美稅則案通過參院</h3>
<p>美聯社二十四日華盛頓電　參院今日以五十三票對三十一票通過新稅則案、此案入衆院後、恐難免再生障碍、因今日參院中所通過之案、與衆院中原案甚相懸殊也、衆議員蘭式奕氏曾在衆院一力主張於該案由聯委會交到時、衆院應將兩院不能歸一致之各稅率、逐節予以票决、以此觀之、則糖稅之爭、又將復作也、稅則案一經在參院中結束後、禁酒律又復入爭執之焦點、</p>

<h3>日無產大同盟失敗</h3>
<p>日聯二十五日東京電　無產政黨自從總選舉之大敗以來、開始聯合團結運動、然社民黨中央委員會對於左派勞農黨之團結提議、加以拒絶、因此無產黨團結問題及組織單一無產黨之希望、盡歸泡影、中間派之大衆黨、亦有排斥勞農黨之意、故將來形勢、大衆黨社民黨全民黨等右派、政黨之聯合問題、或可發生、</p>

<h3>泉州日魚充斥原因</h3>
<p>厦門通信、日人侵略福建沿海魚場、近並以所獲氷凍鮮魚暢銷泉州、致泉屬我國漁業大受影響、各縣沿海漁民團結組魚業大會、謀抵制之法、據魚業工會調查、台灣氷魚之侵入泉州、係由台灣人江褡慶者、去年八月來泉、組織閩南魚業公司、聲稱爲振興中國魚業、實則乃專僱摩托船、赴台灣運氷魚來泉銷售、同時復導日漁輪至泉屬近海獲魚、因是江可獲台魚成本低廉之利、且日輪在泉州海面所捕之魚、亦由江在泉州銷售、故泉州鮮魚市價彼可操縱高下、該公司計有﹁閩南第一﹂﹁閩南第二﹂及﹁榮發九八號﹂三摩托船、每船可儎重六百擔至八百擔、每日售魚平均三百擔、每擔價三四十元、恃爲籍民、可偷漏稅釐、江在台灣極活動、聞台灣總督府曾給以一萬元之奬勵金、可知江之來、實含有日人侵略閩省漁場及魚業市場之使命也、江旣獲利、泉商蘇大餅何大年蔡瑞芳等羨之、亦合資組華南公司赴台灣直接運氷魚來泉應售、嗣泉城魚行協盛合益順興三號亦合組公司、僱日輪西榮丸赴台運魚、泉州少數魚販曾獅頭毛輝等、亦組閩興公司向台灣運魚、於是日人侵略泉屬鮮魚市場計畫漸告成功、六七月來、泉州充斥氷魚、我國株守士法之漁業、乃一蹶而不振、且台魚來泉者多魴鯨魦及各種小魚、魚較大者氷凍難生效力、捕魚輪航行及魚棧屯積逾兩星期之久、到泉後魚商氷凍設置又不完備、每有氷融内部腐化者、亦極碍衛生也、</p>
<p>自泉屬沿海漁民團結組魚業工會後、一方向晉江指委會立案、即進行抵制、第一步函商協會、令各魚商不得販運台魚、第二步集資組織漁業合作社、購魚輪設氷凍櫃、以新法捕魚藏魚、免受天然淘汰、現第一步進行已漸有成效、近旬來泉州氷魚已較前減少、第二步亦正在積極籌備也、（三月二十一日）</p>

<h3>蘇高等法院　續訊葛建時案情形</h3>
<p>被告要求傳繆斌對質</p>
<p>前江蘇省黨部執委兼宣傳部葛建時·執委倪弼·執委兼訓練部長顧子揚·訓練部幹事王志仁·總務科幹事谷曙吟·宣傳部幹事陳柏心·編審科錄事葛尚德等七人、反動嫌欵一案、今日（二十五日）經高等法院在第一法庭開庭繼續審理、並傳到證人陳劍民姚成文吳雨蒼等三人、辯護律師伍澄宇陸象如陳立人徐炳成等四人、庭長林大文、檢察官堵福曜、書記官朱雄武、於下午二時十分開庭、逐一傳訊、至三時十五分始訊畢退庭、各人訊供情形、依次紀錄如下、</p>
<p>顧子揚　官問關於張知悔王德春黄振亞等告密的函件、民政廳已將原函送來、給你看看、顧答張知悔我不認識、有無其人、尚不可知、他說段木貞奉我之命到徐州、召集共產黨開會、我並未派他去、他去没去、我也不知道、段木貞奉省黨部的使命、拿辦共黨一二百人、共黨恨他最甚、這告密的函、恐怕是共黨揑造的、亦未可知、問你再看王德春黄振亞的原函、答這幾個人如果是眞的、何以不註明住址、而民政廳亦未開明、似此情形、恐怕就是繆斌僞造的、想陷害人家吧、究竟怎、請庭長傳繆斌對質、</p>
<p>證人姚成文　官問、你同葛尚德是否親戚、姚答不是的、問葛尚德回你的信對嗎、答是照我給他的信回答的、問你爲什麽事給他信、答因爲那時太倉監委會、被執委會誣控、各監委要反訴他們、囑我擬稿申訴、我就以私人名義寫信給葛尚德、問他要不要反訴、問信中所謂時機未熟、暫緩發動、就指反訴的事情嗎、答是的、</p>
<p>葛尚德　問剛才證人說的話對嗎、答是的、現在吳雨蒼亦已到了、</p>
<p>證人吳雨蒼　問你現任什麽職務、答太倉縣黨部整理委員、問你與葛尚德有親戚關係嗎、答没有的、問你從前任什麽職務、答太倉縣監察委員、問你曾經被人向省黨部控告過嗎、答被執委會向省黨部控告過多次、問他們控告你你反訴過嗎、答也反訴過幾次、問你曾經呌姚成文寫過信嗎、答曾呌他擬具呈文向上級申訴、至於他向葛尚德爲反訴事情通信、當時没有知道、但是記得後來他曾經向我說過的、問葛尚德寫給姚成文那封信的内容、你看見過嗎、答至今没有仔細、但是受執委會挾嫌誣陷、被拘在太倉縣公安局、受刑訊時、公安局長曾經向我說過、問葛尚德信中所說時機未熟、暫緩發動、是否指你們監委會要反訴執委會的事件、答葛尚德給姚成文信、是在太倉監察委會反訴之時、并且就該信上下文語氣看起來、庭上當然明瞭、</p>
<p>葛尚德　問吳雨蒼說的話對嗎、答是的、關於這封信、請庭上注意兩點、一是太倉縣黨部確有糾紛情事、二是這封信内寫的即指太倉黨部内部糾紛情事、只要統觀上下文、便可瞭然、此信實無絲毫反動嫌疑、</p>
<p>葛建時　官問他們二同志說的對嗎、答對的、倪弼　法官問、關於證據的方面、已經調查過、你還有什麽證據上調查之要求否、關於前次庭訊所提史漢清一節、說是你親近的、答親近兩字、如何界說、在法律上有如何意義、而親近事實、有何根據、不能憑繆斌所說、即成證據、問你認得史漢清嗎、答他是縣黨部委員、我是省黨部委員、職務上當然有統屬關係、而私人並無關係、問你還有什麽要請求調查的事、答前江蘇民政廳長繆斌、自長蘇省民政以來、　穢德彰聞、全體黨員全省民衆均恨之剌骨、被告人爲省黨部委員、省黨部居監督行政機關地位、故我們常有指摘他的措施乖謬的事情、所以他懷恨我們、挾嫌報復、當第一次檢察官開偵查庭時、繆斌告我們十大欵、檢察官說都有證據、但未送來、我即向檢察官說、如有證據、而我們被捕已經押在鎭江一個月、爲什麽不送來、檢察官說、他來的公文、說一定有證據、現在本院去函催索、後來到第二次偵查庭時、又隔了二十多天、即是距我們被捕已快兩月了、證據還没有送來、一直到起訴以後、大約在二月底才送來一本抄件、此時距我們被捕已有三個月、經法院一再催索、始送來此等東西、而當中羅列數十條、大都荒謬之詞、惟有一條、與被告人有關、就是說我同著名改組派史漢清親近、這種種抄件日期、都在去年十月十一月間、就是在我們被捕以前、爲什麽到了三個月以後、又經法院幾次催促、才送來這本東西、可見這當中很有僞造嫌疑、挾嫌誣陷、所以要請庭上傳他到庭對質、就是庭上對於他所說的證據、不加採取、而爲明瞭事實起見、被告亦得要請求傳他到庭對質、以顯眞相、問史漢清在鎭江住在省黨部、和住在你家裏、有這事嗎、答我在鎭江住在金山寺和尚廟内　離省黨部很遠、在寺内僅屬寄居、並無家庭、這是很錯誤的、</p>
<p>王志仁　問、　你與盧印泉是同鄉同學嗎、答是的、不過同學已是數年以前的事了、問、盧印泉離開省黨部以後、你與他發生關係没有、答、自他離開省黨部以後、毫未發生關係、問、係寄這一次信與他、有没有其他政治關係、答、毫無其他關係、我不過祗勸他每月寄幾塊錢回家養活他的父母而已、</p>
<p>谷曙吟　問、你同方元民是頗有往來的嗎、答、方元民到省黨部訓練部工作、是十八年、我到省黨部訓練部工作、是在十七年以前、不但毫無往來　而且連認識都不認識、自從同在一部工作以後、因職務上關係、除問一會面外、完全無往來、陳柏心　問、你和王柏春有關係嗎、答、對於這一點、被告人已一再在庭上詳細說明　因同事關係、彼此認識、無所謂往來、問、關於證據方面、有没有請求調查的、答、没有、因爲事情已很明瞭、所謂往來、所指是非常空洞的、根本不值得去調查、</p>
<p>律師陳立人起稱、民廳長函復貴院、附有抄件、並加具意見六條、謂有反動嫌疑之點甚多、但查張知悔等信件、並無確切地址、不啻匿名信件、繆廳長所稱反動嫌疑、究竟有無根據、非傳轇廳長到案對質不可、陸象如律師起稱、中央對於本案、議决適用陪審法、不過爲愼重起見、適用陪審法而已、其實陪審法第三條是限於發回或發交更審之案件、旣有適法公布之陪審法、中央自不能以適用陪審法制度一語、變更法律、應請將本案依法早日審結、徐炳成律師起稱、本案係民廳長告發、非傳繆廳長到不可、陸律師復起稱、張知悔等三封信、民廳雖已將原信送案、但未將彼等住址開明、究竟有無其人、無從知悉、即使有之、亦無從傳詢、請注意、伍澄宇律師起稱、查黨治之下、黨權高於政權、今黨委以被告而出庭、可見尊重司法、前民政廳長繆斌、旣爲原告人、亦應出庭、俾使案情早得大白、又謂適閱證函三封、其間兩封筆跡相同、一封發信地址在鎭江、而具名者爲銅山公民二百餘人、凡此兩點、皆屬可疑、如認爲有採取之必要、非傳繆廳長到案不可、</p>

<h3>留滬　各埠選手行動</h3>
<p>（一）廣東女排球隊訓練</p>
<p>全體百餘人、將於二十九日離滬赴杭、日來在天文臺路運動塲練習至勤、尤以男子排球及女子籃球爲最熱心、廣東女子籃球、向用男子規則、近因全國運動會採用女子規則之兩區制、對於粤隊頗有不利　日來正在訓練女子方法、由韋澤生君指導、該隊人才平均　俱甚活潑、投籃工夫、尤具把握　至於男子排球、非特爲爭遠東代表權、且含有報復主義、因去年廣東中山大學排球來滬、曾被復旦克復、此次廣東代表隊中大選手居多、上海方面、大半係復旦代表、將來相會於全國運動會中、當有一番惡戰、觀粤隊實力、極稱鞏固、戰略頗爲神妙、第一排左邊之一人、尤爲兇猛、總之、該隊有出神入化之傳遞、不可捉摸之殺球、救球工夫、亦極穩健　望上海隊注意之、</p>
<p>（二）遼寗今日不赴杭</p>
<p>全隊仍寓振華旅館、今日當不離滬、其中女子排球隊實力頗强、男女田徑賽固不必說　日來每赴天文臺路（即勞神父路）運動塲練習、男子組約二十餘人、方法純係德國式、蓋因該隊指導係德人蒲慶Ｂochen故也、擲鐵餅不轉身、此法用之於身體高大者固無妨礙　但身矮小之人、甚恐不合宜、賽跑係用脚踵與脚尖交替行之、如百米賽跑、五十米用脚踵　五十米用脚尖　此法似有相當理、</p>
<p>（四）津籃球隊今日觀比賽</p>
<p>第二批選手今日可抵滬</p>
<p>第二批選手、田徑賽　足球、棒球等、均已赴杭、尚有籃球隊現寓交通大學、因杭州全國運動會籃球塲尚未竣工、恐無練習機會、故仍留滬上、以之資練習、今日下午八時、將赴中華籃球房參觀上海隊與匹剌堡之籃球却冷治賽、又該隊指導董守義君及總幹事章輯五君尚未來滬、預料董章兩君、偕女子選手團、可於今日下午抵滬云、</p>
<p>（五）青島選手今日赴杭</p>
<p>青島選手原定昨日下午離滬赴杭、因日來忙於製辦用品、仍未起程、聞於今日上午赴杭云、</p>

<h3>海容艦昨回滬</h3>
<p>莊總司令尚在奉化</p>
<p>蔣總司令回鄉掃墓、所乘之海容軍艦　昨早已回淞口加煤　隨行之建康艦　尚在寗波瀝港、蔣氏至昨日午刻、未有離奉化消息　海軍部政務次長陳紹寛、聞亦偕蔣在奉化云、</p>
<h3>吳淞外大霧阻輪</h3>
<p>奉天丸遲到　大連汽船會社之奉天丸輪、今回從大連經青島來滬、本定昨日進口、該輪中有參加浙江全國運動大會之東北選手一部、乘該輪來滬、轉往杭州、乃該輪於二十四日夜中駛到三夾水外、海面忽下大霧、船舶行駛、其航綫忽被霧露阻没、不能辨别、船主爲愼重航海計、即令停泊海面、待霧散後再開、致昨日未經到滬、須改今晨方能進口、而旅客等在船被阻一天至滬、</p>
<p>美郵船阻滯　美國郵船公司太平洋郵船傑菲遜號輪、由美來滬、照例昨晨可以進口、迨行至吳淞外、約距五十海哩之處、路綫已被霧没、船主恐有危險、即在該處抛錨、擬俟霧退後進口、及至昨午、該輪又受潮水减退之牽制、不能行動、遂致不能開來、當發無綫電到滬、言候潮漲後方可出淺駛滬、約須今日進口矣、其在上海出口之船、至吳淞外爲霧阻者、統於昨日午刻、方得陸續出海、</p>

<p>往來客檢查　本埠江海關奉命檢查各商輪往來旅客、原令進出口船、在吳淞口停泊、候海關人員上船檢查、嗣經本埠各輪公司請求、因與淞潮大水急、停車候檢、常有發生船舶互撞或被潮衝擱危險、要求免檢、江海關未允、現聞此事已磋商結果、改令各商輪至吳淞藴草浜内停泊、再候關員查檢、則公私兩便、可無意外之虞、即日便須實行檢查矣、</p>
<p>快利開滬裝修　招商局快利輪、在上江馬家寨被匪徒開砲放槍襲擊、船員幸未受傷、已誌昨報、現該輪已電告將從沙市開還上海、專備架裝鋼板、爲司機與旅客避彈之用、蓋上江各地匪踪飄忽、輪行十分危險、非裝鋼鐵板、殊難行駛也</p>

<h3>記羅馬聖母像之恐慌</h3>
<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>自蘇俄實行反宗敎運動以來。其國内敎士之殘殺。敎堂之毀滅。已日見於報章。固無庸贅述。即在國外。蘇俄共黨乃亦有從事毀滅基督敎之計劃。近據西報刋載十五日倫敦通信。謂羅馬城内。頃已有大批蘇俄秘密團到來。從事反敎之工作。緣羅馬爲敎皇駐驛之地。全球基督敎之中心點也。蘇俄共黨先從其中心點着手。計亦可謂狡矣。蘇俄秘密團自到羅馬後。其第一步之示威運動。則在破毀羅馬萬鐵開花園中Ｖatican　Ｇarden之聖母瑪利亞雕像是也。該像爲敎皇雅立三大第三所建立。歷史悠久。工程浩大。非特爲敎會中人所保管維勤供奉不替。即遠方來客。偶經其地。亦不禁仰望贊嘆。極意景仰之也。羅馬敎會自聞蘇俄秘密團來後。恐慌異常。羣籌保護之策。良久而無所聞焉。然臨近居民。此後每於深夜聞像下有羣犬狂吠之聲。聲厲而長。一若有盜匪臨門。巨獒羣起抗拒之狀。乃羣相告曰　敎皇近蓄厲獒以護聖母。蘇俄共黨雖暴　當亦遇之却步。而其有迷信神道者。則竟謂聖母顯靈。以禦强暴者。則更可笑矣。不知聖母像畔　固無一犬。其深夜吠聲　乃爲一秘密之機關。非眞有巨獒千百以維衛此聖像也。敎會中人。爲保護聖像計。羣籌良計。已如上述。其中有一神父馬曼琦者　ＦatherＬulgiＭarmagg一擅有巧思之無線電專家也。首先供獻一絶妙之機關。法以犬吠聲之留聲機片接以電流。裝以發音器。暗置於像之右側、再以陰陽電線。通至像之四週。另設觸機。設有不速之客。行近像側。足觸機。陰陽電通。留聲機乃自然發動。通音於發音器。於是聲囂如羣犬之狂吠矣。此機之裝設。事前十分秘密。知之者僅神父及其一助手耳。故機成之翌日。敎皇偶游其地。足忽觸及其暗機。轉瞬間羣犬狂吠。若將撲而噬之者。敎皇大驚。即引避。命衛隊巡邏。則一無所得。神父告知之。乃相與大笑。亦一趣事也。按歷史上此種機關。並非創聞。其最著者如古皇沙洛蒙之宫殿中。有假獅作吼。以衛御室。古皮順帝Ｂyzantine之可汗。亦嘗設機關。每遇外國使臣。晋殿拜謁行近御座之際。有獅吼聲以驚異族者。今之羅馬神父。亦不過倣其法而行之。惟其機件之巧拙。當遠過於古代。可斷言耳。</p>
<h3>白鷺洲之小刦</h3>
<p>— 維</p>
<p>都中名勝頗不少。白鷺洲亦其一也。在城之東南。渡秦淮。可數百步即達。雖不甚幽美。然亦楚楚有園林清氣。笙歌盈耳之區。得此已難能可貴。况又有詩聖李白之﹁二水中分白鷺洲﹂之名句乎。惜去歲在此駐軍。亭榭草木。毀壞特甚。疊石爲竈。積磚爲厠。炊於斯。溺於斯。區區之白鷺洲。竟成營幕。近日往顧。雖駐者已遷。軍政部煌煌然保護之布告已張。而其中猶滿目荒凉。遺跡尚未盡去也</p>
<h3>理髮店之謎</h3>
<p>— 顏也</p>
<p>任何理髮店。他們門首的商標。終是長約兩尺組約碗口大的左右兩個圓柱般的東西。上面畫紅黑白三色。斜上迴繞。好像三根帶子。中通電流。使他旋捲不息。夜裏更在裏面裝了電火。委實轉得有趣。鄉下人初到上海看見了。往往駐足不去。有的雖不用這柱形會轉的。也必在門首平面上畫上同樣的兩個。我對於這個東西。久抱懷疑。爲什麽必要用這東西做商標。問了許多人。他們也不懂。有時且反而問我。後來我想理髮師他們自已終會知道的。那知在我理髮時共問了五六家。他們也個個不知其所以然。祇說是多年傳下來的老商標。外國回來的人說。世界各國理髮店的商標也都是這個東西。於是我便斷定這商標一定有世界性。而他的來歷也定在外國。最近問到一個熟於外國掌故的人。他猶不敢肯定的說。聽說從前歐洲地方有一個外科醫生。他把這個盤旋東西做他的商標。因爲醫斷臂折足。要用繃帶。這柱上的三條顏色就是繃帶的象形。後來他抛了仁心仁術的醫生不做。改做頂上功夫的理髮師。可是他職業雖換。商標却不換。各理髮店見他道個標識來得有趣。便不知不覺地倣行起來。到如今才傳遍各國了。他說完了。又鄭重地說。這個解釋是眞是假。實不敢决定。那末這一個謎依然不能揭曉啊。</p>
<h3>圖書館之鵠</h3>
<p>— 筱彭</p>
<p>鵠水鳥也。又名天鵝。恒棲止於湖澤間。日常則不多見。日前。本邑（銅山）公共圖書館得一鵠。蓋邑人劉步洲所贈者。緣本年廢歷正月初旬某日夜深時。劉於睡夢聞　聞院内撲撲有聲。疑有竊者。披衣起。燭之。則門户依然。固無穿窬之徒也。嗣於院中角隅。覩一物。見其全體潔白。非鶴非鵝。異之。遂縶於庭内。後有來觀者。始識爲鵠。劉以蓄之家庭。徒勞飼養。不若置之公地。以供衆覽。因贈於該館。是鵠身大於雁。羽毛白澤。嘴扁。前端黑。腿短。蹼其足。望而知爲游禽類也。現李館長特就館内隙地。構一鐵絲籠塲。内砌水池。旁連木屋。以爲該鳥游宿之所。日飼以糟粕等物。逐日觀者絡繹。咸謂鴻鵠至此。不啻人之落伍云。紅氍毹</p>
<h3>春明劇訊</h3>
<p>— 劉恨我自北平寄</p>
<p>入春以來。平中名伶。競排新曲。如尚小雲之全本白蛇傳。馬連良之大紅袍。郝壽臣之鴻門宴。朱琴心之俠鳳緣。章遏雲之杏元和番。雪艶琴之盤絲洞。新艶秋楊小樓言菊朋之覇王遇虞姬等。積極排練。以資號召。聞於最短期間。即可出演。</p>
<p>一日之夕。開明戲院夜戲。六時即告滿座。戲碼爲吳彩霞之落花園。傅小山之巧連環。言菊朋之上天臺。惟臨時更易賣馬。並增董俊峯之草橋關一劇。新艶秋之全本鴛鴦塚。楊小樓之鐵龍山帶上坡。名伶佳劇。薈萃一塲。而久未一聆之吳彩霞。老大年華。未免遲暮。然嗓音如舊。嬌音動人。新艶秋更爲今日歌塲驕子。力摹玉霜。頗有神似。一舉一動。掌聲如雷。亦足以自豪矣。</p>
<p>袁師寒雲於七日下午由津來平。即夕在開明戲院。與名伶馬連良王幼卿合演審頭剌湯。聞演劇後稍作勾留。旋即去津云。</p>
<p>程艶秋以天津新新戲院挽友來邀。並約言菊朋郝壽臣等合演。程業已首肯。定於十四十五十六三夕。戲碼亦排就爲玉堂春。燭影計。紅拂傳。第三日適星期。故於日間加演法門寺代在大審。聞演畢返平。將以鳴和社出演於華樂園。一說須俟貫大元由滬歸後。方可擇期出演云。</p>
<h3>何豚考</h3>
<p>— 覺迷</p>
<p>每屆初春。河豚出時。食之而死者。報紙上不絶於書。夫河豚名稱旣是不一。形狀蓋亦不一。爲作河豚考。投之本談。</p>
<p>信及豚魚。見於易經。河豚之名。由來已久。莊子適見　子。食於其死母者。則豚或作㹠博雅。鯸鮔。魨也。背青腹白。觸物即怒。其肝殺人。則博雅所謂鯸鮔者。蓋即河豚。而本草集解。河魨狀如科斗。大者尺餘。背色青白。有黄縷。無鱗。腮目能脡者。有毒。一名鯸鮧。一名鰗鮧。一名䲅魚。本作豚。則本草集解所謂魨者。又即河豚。山海經敦水東流。注于雁門之水。其中多䰽。䰽之魚。食之殺人。本草謂即鯸鯃。則山海經所謂䰽者。又即河豚。左思吳都賦。𩵭鮪鯸鮐。註謂鯸鮐。狀如科斗。大者尺餘。腹下白。背上青黑。有黄文。是與博雅所載鯸鮔。正復相同。則左思吳都賦所謂鯸鮐。又即河豚。王充論衡。鮭肝殺人。而雷公砲炙論。鮭魚一名䲅魚。一名嗔魚。日華子謂之鰗魚。今謂之河豚。本草䲅魚。一名鰗鮧。以物觸之。即嗔腹如氣球。亦曰嗔魚。白背。有赤道如印。魚目得合。與諸魚不同。即今河豚。則論衡本草所謂鮭魚䲅魚者。又即河豚。是可知鯸鮐。河魨。䰽魚。鯸鮐。鮭魚。䲅魚。皆爲河豚之名。而鯸鮧。鰗鮧。嗔魚。等皆爲河豚别名。而各書所載河豚之毒。皆在於肝。此則凡食河豚者。所不可不知者也</p>
<h3>紙鳶談</h3>
<p>— 楊一笑</p>
<p>公輸削木鳶而高飛。當時祇有鳶而無紙鳶也。後候景圍臺城。簡文作紙鳶。飛空告急於外。是爲紙鳶之始。五代漢李業與隱帝爲紙鳶於宫外放之。博物志今之紙鳶引絲而上。小兒張口而觀。可洩内熱。豈知紙鳶傳至國外。美國大儒法蘭克林。即因之而發明空中電學。今西方之研究紙鳶者。突飛猛進。莫如英國。當有紙鳶競賽會之舉。盛極一時云。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（一五六）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十回　赤燄騰天勾欄欽孝女　紅毹貼地即席晤名伶</p>
<p>那個味蓴園借給人家開會。。只要預先幾天。。和園主人商量。。你出了相當的租價。。他無有不答應的。。可是逢着激烈的開會。。他往往所得不償所失。。爲什麽呢。。那種開會。。都是爲了公益的事。。這每天的租價。。還要請他帮帮忙。。他也不能多要。。到了開會的當兒。。什麽人都好來。。這本來是公開的。。把他那座大洋房喚做安𤧸弟的擠得水洩不通。。有的擠在後面。。看不見演說的人是誰。。便椅子上桌子上都會踏上去。。把椅子都踏破了。。人多口雜。。向誰去算那筆賬。。記得有一次。。爲了俄羅斯什麽義勇隊的事。。借着張家花園開了一個國民大會。。那時候中國正在民氣鼓動的當兒。。說是兩點鐘開會。。到一點鐘的時候。。人已擠滿了。。有幾個志士。。正從日本回來。。像現在的黨國老前輩吳穉睴先生。。也正從日本回來。。今天有他老先生的演說。。來的人越加多了。。他老先生演說得很激烈。。到了最警惕的地方。。說一句把拳頭在桌子上敵一下。。到後來演說得聲音也嘶嗄了。。拳頭也腫破了。。可是連那紅木的桌子也敲破了。。這一次開會。。直到了大衆散了。。園主人檢點器具。。踏破了椅子十三隻。。擊破了紅木八仙桌一隻。。打破了茶壺茶碗一共也有十幾隻。。他向誰去索賠呢。。也只好自認晦氣罷了。。不過張家花園。。逢着開會。。都借他的地方。。在歷史上很有可以紀念的成績。。現在的幾位黨國偉人。。都還有些記得呢。。而且每逢開會。。總是在星期日。。星期日又是張園最熱閙的日子。。那班洋行小鬼和堂子裏的先生。。也都在這天來跑馬車到張園來兜圈子。。張園是廻環修了一條馬路。。從東面可以兜到西面。。所以那班蕩子妖姬。。名媛國士。。常常的擠在一起。。好在那個味蓴園並蓄兼收。。不分畛域。。他那裏也有雅事。。也有俗事。。什麽蘭花會咧。。菊花會咧。。春秋佳日。。也集了許多人。。分題吟詠。。開了什麽詩社。。那總算是雅事了。。然而也常常有那種姘馬夫戲子的濫污嫖子。。爲了爭風吃醋的事。。約了流氓。。各人喊了各人的黨羽。。帶了鐵尺揷子。。大家打個明白。。往往也是在張家花園閙出這種把戲。。這也可以算得惡俗不堪的了。。可是上海地方却也不算一回事的。。</p>

<p>午後收盤漲起一兩四　後市開盤九十六兩半、旋後僅爲五兩七錢、乃恒興等售出、繼由各號售出遠期英金十一辨七五六二五、嗣因套頭等復進、故英金亦轉堅勢、銀行互做本月份十一辨士三七五、四月四三七五、興業吃進遠期花旗四十七元六八七五、六月英金向結十一辨士四三七五、乃金價忽已跳上二兩餘、竟達九十八兩一錢、三點以後突又向挫、實乃多頭方面乘勢而售、並以六月英金銀行均肯售出、價爲十一辨士四三七五、銀行互做十一辨士半、三點半後爲六兩五六錢、入後略形拉起數錢、迨四點卅分收盤爲九十七兩三錢、比較隔昨計漲一兩四錢、　　撳少十兩左右　查一日間最大九十八兩五錢、最小九十五兩七錢、計有二兩八錢差次、結價仍計五百零七兩、計撳小十兩有零、午後揭價計抑小十兩左右、登賬補水同計九十七兩、物品早開九十七兩六錢、午收六兩四錢、下午六兩半、收市七兩、</p>

<h3>銀錢業務之定勢</h3>
<p>市塲概况　連日市塲中做開之厘拆市價、恍同刻版文章、軒輊輒微、市氣遂無顯豁可能銀行方面目前本有供需頻繁之機會、今被錢莊方面守定把穩宗旨、無法擴充、祗得隨勢進退、故至今依然故我、毫無新頴消息、足資紀述耳、</p>
<p>厘拆價格　早市厘價仍爲七錢二分○一毫二忽半、與前日又復相同、午市微覺好起一毫二忽半、銀拆市價早市三分　午市二分、結果亦與前日相　、劃頭以出欵較多　始終白劃、</p>
<p>輔幣市情　江南小洋早市不過四千角交易、市價較前日遞昂七毫半、爲六錢一分六厘、午市因無交易　市價勿動、廣東小洋早市爲五錢九分六厘七毫半、午市爲八毫七忽半、高低相距亦僅一毫二忽半之譜、做出交易、早市十九萬角午市五萬五千角、銅元又弱五百文、爲三百九十一千五百文、</p>

<h3>債市稍轉清閒</h3>
<p>編遣漲五角半其他互有漲跌</p>
<p>昨日公債期貨交易轉清、市塲人氣閒散、前後市成交合五百七十餘萬元、内關稅約佔二百萬元、善後近一百三十萬元、續捲一百餘萬元、其他各債均頗清閒、現貨交易共三萬三千元、中編遣因小票交易頗活動、佔二萬七千元、善後四千元、金融二千元、各債價因債市環象沉靜、市塲人氣益清、債價乃以呆定、前後市祗數角盤旋、結果較前日編遣漲五角半、其他互有漲跌　爲數祗在二三角左右、又三月期貨以交割期近、今日即停止市塲交易云、</p>

<h3>紗花　紗市補空轉堅</h3>
<p>紗市略漲、大勢情形仍疲、蓋底貨太厚、二十支五福牧羊紗囤積殊巨、銷路頗缺、以後各鄉農事將忙、紗銷愈絶、故人心多數觀跌、非有特殊變動、難以提高也、賣方正已解進倉庫中二十支五福牧羊紗四千五百包、十支孔雀一千包、三羊三百包、雙喜一百包、寳彝五百包、共計六千四百包、有此巨量之交貨、市面大受打擊也、查商塲中有一大户兩日扒空、約計有六七千包之巨、故　面略形乾燥、</p>
<p>本月紗回高一兩　人標前市開盤、形勢尚平、　以　利者　補、市氣稍堅、各　上　、　多數　　多頭賣出了結、結果本月跌八　、連月跌一·一一·三錢　午後以四十號抵空、包額較巨、且有業外者以底　便充做多、市勢較堅　各月漲二·四·六·七錢、全日成交統計一萬九千三百五十包、兹將人標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>本棉與外市背馳</h3>
<p>棉市晨平午堅、但海外棉市趨跌、本棉反爲穩靜、實以檯面較緊、新抛户缺乏、漢路來源仍稀、故漢帮拉緊、始終不肯放鬆、但現紗銷路岑寂、廠需益覺停滯云、</p>
<p>期棉扒空略漲　交易所漢標前市開盤微跌、後以賣氣未盛、散户扒空稍漲、遠月跌五分至一錢、午後市况驟挺、各月漲五分至二錢、全日成交統計二萬七千八百担、茲將漢標收盤錄左、</p>

<h3>國外紗花跌多漲少</h3>

<h3>糧食　米市疊見上漲</h3>
<p>頂粳已喊至二十一元</p>
<p>閘北　昨日河下來貨益見凋零、存底續漸枯薄、故買方進意愈殷、賣方勢必高抬扳售、致頂白粳貨客竟喊價二十一元、結果做開普通高粳二十元零七角半、總計中次各貨均漲一兩角、按斯等價格、係滬上第一次耳、薄稻亦轉向上、客帮稍有交易、市勢因此活潑、羊秈來源尚有、惟數極微　故到埠立即銷完、行銷步漲角半、杜子客埠等秈市上寥寥、且又乏到、是以雖見隨緊、亦屬無若何交易、變陰元一致挺堅、買氣興旺、形勢大佳</p>
<p>滬南　河下來貨仍稀、走銷大暢、常帮粳及蘇同粳因產價頻昻、及產地有特殊客帮旺購、致蓮商觀望　影響本埠到源、查邇來因時局不靖、奸商乘機牟利、致使產銷兩地、米價疊漲、危害民食、如本外埠當局再不設法救濟、滬地行將斷到、奇盤亦必立時發現、隱患大堪注意、南帮薄稻因店銷飯胃均平、行情祗微堅而已、羊杜尖市况最秀、緣貨稀銷暢、價提兩角、白元本街銷路暢滯不一、吊銷揀高落手、大盤隨大勢而升角外、全日斛數頗旺、較前日爲多耳、</p>
<h3>期洋米續開五千噸</h3>
<p>昨日洋米有内地暢辦、本街　取、市面續好、現米前存已微、新到有待、市價暗挺數分、計開出敏當三百包、小絞二千包、一號西貢五百包、路貨開出四千包、亦好數分、期貨初頗看好、因有洋行售出餘額一千五百噸、市面轉居定勢、共計開　五千餘噸、仍以回突居多數云、</p>
<h3>標粉做多再飛騰</h3>
<p>日份商、上午各月份、因洋　　價、做好一二角、人心大致　定、　大　多　、仍見　步　收四五月份、致業内外人心、未免均存昻　之　耳、迨至下午開盤、以大户多頭、對四五六月份、仍事抬價、因此各月份均步步飛騰、至大小廠　乘此機會、抛售頗暢、天津帮亦無間津、查大户之做多、惟一之目標、即係正值青黄、小麥存底枯薄、兼之主要食品之米價、以各處蓋　甚虚、一致飛漲、因之熱中之投機、遂大事收買、故此種漲價、彷彿純爲人力所造成、初非供求之不相稱所致也、結果本月份較前日漲一分七釐半、四五月份各漲一分二釐半、六月份漲一分半、七月份漲一分、八月份漲一分二釐半云、</p>
<h3>本月麥回出獨疲</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月係之趨勢、頗不一致、本月份因交割已近、空頭方面、均已準備交貨、多方除預備收貨者外、餘則均求了結、故粉市雖佳、洋麥雖微漲、市况反呈疲滯也、遠期各月份、因外行人心仍佳、交易亦夥、故均呈俏勢、此後觀望、如粉市再抬、自當仍看穩挺也、結果本月份較前日小二分、四月份好二分、六七八三月份各好一分、現貨市况、仍見平穩、惟所開均係中次、高貨甚少、聞宿州麥清江浦麥徐州麥安慶麥五兩一錢、五兩零五分、四兩九錢半、湖南麥四兩七錢、江西麥五兩零五分、五兩零三分、五兩、四兩九錢八分、四兩八錢八分、共開九千三百五十包、由阜豐申大辦去云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　實銷祇賴本街</h3>
<p>疋市昨無變化　實銷惟本街有日漸進展之勢、良以天時日暖、　單夾衣料紛紛發動、昨東貨之條子府綢走銷甚暢、清官鏡於三錢零五厘售罄、箭來圖又有一批運到、售三錢一分　楊貴妃三錢售去亦不少、三才子印花開三錢九分、三馬頭四錢、印花色汀花樣較佳者亦有一空之象　價俱售二錢左右、細嗶嘰亦日有走動、湖心亭秃藍灰昨開二錢三分、什色二錢二分七厘半、百子圖二錢二分半、内地帮成交一百餘件、文明夕法色汀亦呈漸缺之狀、梅蘭芳洋美人均告售罄、大得利開一錢八分二厘半、以本街購進較多、川漢帮依然呆滯、實以時局不靖之故　西貨平定、珠羅紗建帮進二十多件、德記泰和貨均三錢七分半云、</p>
<h3>五金　五金銷路蕭索</h3>
<p>五金市情、邇因環境險惡、各帮銷胃滯疲、因是趨况奇靜、全市除花色貨微有點綴外、大路貨無指染者、幸市價堅挺、致一般同業尚無恐慌之象、到貨近來頗夥、因此流通市上之五金品、異常豐滿、據諳悉内幕者云、最近市上存貨苟在二三月内無到貨、諒無軋缺之恐慌也、</p>
<h3>南北貨　厦橘餅號盤已落兩許</h3>
<p>﹁厦橘餅﹂近日陸續有到、惟因各帮走塲轉呆、價遂回跌、查現下號盤比前已降兩許、行售亦無起色、﹁金橘餅﹂久乏到貨、市存已絶、聞地頭尚在製作、大約月杪可到、</p>
<p>﹁芡　﹂近以走銷不暢、價漸廉宜、現市僅零星交易、昨日池芡售十八九兩、南芡售七十二元、趨勢平平、﹁毫紅棗﹂昨又開出一車、貨品中中、價爲六兩八錢、﹁下檔圓肉﹂市存漸薄、近又乏到、昨市號盤回升半兩、走塲亦漸活動、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗砂白逐步趨漲</h3>
<p>昨日紐約期糖五月份一·七、九九份一·八三、十二月份一·九一、各升二分、爪哇現糖及四月份期糖價均一○·五○、五月份一○·七五、各升○六二五、公會市塲劃盤荷糖二十四號粗砂白、買氣尚活、第外市之告漲、市氣轉堅、而出户减價因以增高、而買方進意尚濃、故結果市又步升、初市價爲七兩二錢、且出户殊缺、旋即升至七兩二錢二分半、後市雖無顯著之上漲、而市形固甚俏秀也、磨細砂白七兩二錢七分半、交易殊寥、日糖略穩、﹁Ｎ﹂嘜七兩八錢、ＹＴ嘜七兩六錢二分、交易甚爲凋零云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　日絲疲中絲銷進展難</h3>
<p>横濱日絲仍因東匯堅漲、市氣疲滯、昨市現絲呌價祗一千一百六十五日元、致華絲歐銷亦難進展、海外電轉絲價不高、華商則以手貨不充、絲本仍昻不願虧本抛售、成交益清、昨祗有餘等進滬白廠經三十包、達昌等進白乾經二十包、價均平定云、</p>

<h3>平漢鐵路　調車設計導言　鄭寳照</h3>
<p>我國今後凡百新事業之改進發展。端在盡量應用近代科學發明之功效。故鐵路之採用歐美技術制度。實爲今日一重大問題、顧握其主要。不外以遠到之眼光。與緻密之考慮。體察現在實况及將來需要然後出以明智之果。决定因應之方針。復以精詳之計劃。爲實施之標準。使事實學理脗合無間。然後收效始能盡如所期。</p>
<p>列車調度制爲現在世界鐵路行車最嶄新最完美之制度。其增進運輸功能與經濟所獲成績之卓越。吾人姑舍抽象之理論而以實質之數字證明之。英倫米蘭鐵路於一九○八年採用列車調度制。據該路統計一九○七年列車延誤時間數每週平均爲二一八六九小時。迫採用列車調度制後。逐年遞减。至一九一三年僅七七四九小時。比較一九○七年減少百分之六十四。茲將該路各年列車延誤時數。列舉於左。以證行車工作之改善。</p>
<p>每週平均延誤時數</p>
<p>一九○七年　二一八六九</p>
<p>一九○八年　一四五○一</p>
<p>一九○九年　一一六八○</p>
<p>一九一○年　九五四六</p>
<p>一九一一年　八九五九</p>
<p>一九一二年　七八七八</p>
<p>一九一三年　七七四九</p>
<p>試復將該路同一時期之貨物列車延誤時數與其進欵相較。則更有意味。計一九○七年貨物列車進欵每七鎊八司令延誤一小時。一九一三年每二十二鎊四司令延誤一小時。又再從運輸工作之經濟言之。該路一九一三年貨運噸數共計五○五○○三○○噸。比較一九○七年增加三二三七○○○噸。一九一三年貨運進欵一三二九七○○○鎊。比較一九○七年增加八三○七五○鎊。但噸數與進欵雖增。而列車里程反比一九○七年减少一六五○○○○英里。機煤節省九三一六○噸。至客車運輸亦有同樣之成績。茲以篇幅所限。不及具列。然即以所舉數目比較而觀。列車調度制對於運輸經濟與效能之增進。已自可驚。</p>
<p>此不獨米蘭一路爲然。舉凡英倫三島及其屬地與夫歐美兩大陸諸鐵路之採用此制者。靡不收相當之效果。設我國内亂旦夕寢息。社會秩序恢復。諸般建設以次實施。則以農工商業發達之結果。鐵路運輸效能與經濟亟需有大規模之增進以設施落後之今日各鐵路所有機車車輛及其他一切設備勢非大加擴張不可。列車次數將隨運輸之激增而日趨繁密。則列車調度制之亟應採行。又寗俟論。特以世界鐵路之採用此制者。各以其路線長短。設備完缺。運輸之性質與數量。互相懸殊。故其組織運用。以及職權範圍。不能無程度上之差異。吾人於計畫我國鐵路採用此制之先。不得不對於世界先進鐵路之成規。擇其主要者。作詳盡之論究。</p>
<p>今請先言英倫及其屬地各鐵路。</p>
<p>在英倫三島採用列車調度之鐵路。有倫敦米蘭蘇格底士鐵路（ＬondonＭidlandandＳcotishＲailway）。倫敦東北鐵路（ＬondonandＮorthＥasternＲuilway及大西鐵路（ＧreatＷestemＲiiwqy）。</p>
<p>在大英帝國之他部。則有印度一部分鐵路南菲各鐵路（ＳouthＡpriＲailways）。加拿大合衆國各國有鐵路（ＦederalＮatioalＲailwaysofＣanada）及馬拉斯亞合衆國鐵路、ＦederlＲailwayofＭalaysia）。其所採制度雖各有不同。但調度制所掌管職務之範圍。不外下列數項。（一）保證列車之準時。（二）當例行列車不足以運輸之需要時。開行牲畜。易腐食品。及他項貨物之輔助列車。（三）利用機車拖引力量。使獲完滿之效果。并於可能範圍内以最經濟之方法。處理運輸。（四）裝載列車至最大限量。（五）遇有出險或軌道發生障礙時。改變列車路綫或取消列車。（六）嚴密考量運輸數量。可期開行整列貨車。運送最大距離。減少停止地點至最少限度。（七）調節各鄰欵大站之運輸。（八）設法運輸不能以普通方法運送之貨物。此外復有推廣列車調度之範圍。包括分配車輛。調範起卸事宜。掌理司機火夫曁其他列車人員之輪值。并考核其工作。以免超過時問。曁編訂時刻表及行車圖等事宜。至其組織大體。可分爲下列四項。（甲）設立總調態處。管轄全綫運轉事宜。（乙）劃分路綫爲若干叚每叚設調度處隸屬於總調度處。由總調度稽核各叚調度事宜。（丙）劃分路綫爲若干分叚。各設分叚調度處。直隸於該管之總叚調度處。各總叚調度處復隸屬於總調度處。如米蘭蘇格司鐵路是也。（丁）劃分路綫爲若干叚。每叚設立調度處。隸屬各該叚之叚長。有設立總調度處者。如大西鐵路是。有不設總調度處者。如倫敦西北鐵路是。</p>
<p>次言美國各鐵路。</p>
<p>美國單軌及雙軌鐵路多採用ＤispatchinyＳystem。乃將鐵路一區叚之運輸事務。由一中心地點指揮之。其主旨欲於最短之時間。行駛多數之列車。以達到工作費用之經濟。美國鐵路聯合會（ＡmeriunnＲuilwayＡssociation）所頒布之標準法規（Ｓtandardcade）乃美國鐵路共守之通則。取根據其内載條文之規定。所有列車調度事項。悉置於調度員（Ｄfsputcher）之掌握。調度員隸屬於總調度員（ＣhiefＤispatcher）之下。其普通權限如左。（甲）飭令列車之開行。（在單軌路綫得變更錯車越車地點。在雙軌路綫則指揮列車駛入岔道或雙軌之路綫。并决定未經確定時刻之列車之錯會地點。且爲免除路綫擁擠起見。於必要時得提前開行貨物列車。（乙）取消例行列車或專車。（丙）管理調車機車。材料列車。或工人列車等在主要路綫上之行駛。（丁）依照運輸情形。調節或監督列車裝載。（戊）調遣專車。調車機車。或援救列車。此外間有鐵路之調度員。須調節碼頭及終點大站之運輸。在其他鐵路則由總調度員負責辦理此項職務。間有鐵路之調度員。復負責辦理列車人員替班事宜。又間有鐵路之調度員。祗負責防止司機火車及列車人員違反聯邦律之行動。在其他鐵路之調度員無權干預此項事務。（未完）</p>

<h3>河北徵收養路費辦法　悟非</h3>
<p>公路築成之後。欲期永久利賴。自非保養不爲功。顧保養公路。胥恃經費。則其費之來源。當然是一重要問題。近頃河北省曾訂有徵收養路費章程十二條。經省府通過。核准施法行。攷其辦法。足資仿傚。按錄其大要。俾資遵循。查河北省省路局。依照組織大綱第七條之規定。徵收養路費。故將省路分爲三等。以已修之路交通甚敏。保養較難者爲一等路。以已修之路。交通較簡。保養稍易者二等路。以就原有官道。加以平墊。可以通行汽車者爲三等路。其通行省路之車輛。以汽車·四輪馬車·平輪大車。平輪轎車·電汽自行車·自行車·人力車·等七種爲限。其餘車輛牲畜。一概不准通行。因之按諸公路之等級。以及車輛之類别。凡通行省路。應照所定費率。繳納養路費。（甲）汽車。一等客車在二十座以上三十座以下者。每華里每月納養路費一元一角。二等客車十座以上二十座以下者。每華里每月納養路費八角·三等客車在十　以下者·每</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>華里　月　　　費五角。其一等貨車在二噸以上三噸以下者。二等貨車在一噸以上二噸以下者。三等貨車在一噸以下者。應納之養路費。與上述三種客車。同其等級。此外汽車之經行第一等省路在一百里以内者。其養路費按照上定費率規定。由一百零一里至二百里。每月減收養路費五分。由二百零一里至三百里。每月減收養路費一角。由三百零一里至四百里。每月減收養路費一角五分。其經行二等路者七折徵收。經行三等路者五折徵收。（乙）四輪馬車每月收養路費十三元。（丙）平輪貨車駕雙套者。每月收養路費六元。單套者三元。（丁）平輪轎車每月收養路費三元。（戊）電汽自行車每月收養路費十二元。（已）人力車每月收養路費五角。觀此則以行程之遠近。定徵費之多寡。以車輛之種别。定收取之標準。且也凡此諸車。無論通行何等省路。均按是例。分别徵收。可謂合乎法理。允當不移矣。但行駛車輛。漫無稽核。故定凡駛省路之車輛。須按月向該管省路局請領牌照。標明車上。以便檢查。無照不准通行若營業汽車須先向各該管省路局呈請註册。經核准發給執照後。始得請領牌照。其長途營業汽車之註册規則。另訂專章。各種車輛自經註册核准。發給執照之後。則逐月換領牌照。應將全月養路費一次繳清。如有不領牌照。或牌照已過斯　　換傾者。私自通行。一經查出。除　領牌照並照常納費外。又須按照納費　目。　以一倍至三倍之　金。其成有臨時通過之各種自用專輛。其養路費按照上列規定費率。計日收四分之三。倘慈善團體及官署公用之車輛。或則從事救濟。或則便利案書。因之必須通過省路時。若先通知該管省路局發給執照。得免收養路費。此外如各縣路局以建築公路。工費頗鉅。保養公路。亦須徵收。得由各縣政府規定。呈請省建廳核准備案。凡此諸端。皆爲河北省徵收養路費之辦法。各處可擷章則之所長。視當地之狀况。規定徵收養路費用。俾公路之修築。隨時有費。而免於路面陷落。轉多危險之患矣。</p>

<h3>Sun Dianying's Troops Have Been Completely Eliminated</h3>
<p>Troops Stationed in Guide Withdrew the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Han Fuqu Personally Supervised the Troops at Liu River</p>
<p>The Longhai Railway Traffic Is About to Be Restored</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Sun Dianying's troops near the Longhai Line have been completely eliminated as of the 25th. The majority of his troops in Guide, starting from the 20th, were attacked from the west by Sun Dongxuan, Zhang Deshun, and other divisions dispatched by Han Fuqu. After fierce battles, Sun's troops were surrounded within Guide City and the situation was resolved on the 24th. A portion of his troops in Mamuji were simultaneously attacked by Chen Jicheng's division dispatched by Liu Zhi, starting from the 21st, and surrounded within Mamuji. One division dispatched an artillery unit to assist in the attack, and the situation was also resolved on the morning of the 24th. The remaining troops fled south towards Luyi and Zhecheng. They were intercepted by the Central Army along the way and suffered a major defeat. Han Fuqu personally went to Liu River to supervise the troops a few days ago and is currently handling the aftermath there. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Chen Jicheng came to Xuzhou on the 25th to meet with Liu Zhi and reported on everything. The bridges destroyed around Guide can be repaired immediately. Passenger trains on the west line will resume operation within days. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Two armored trains unified by Beiping have been patrolling between Pingyuan and Xuzhou for days. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Xuzhou dispatch on the 25th: (1) Sun Dianying's army was attacked from both Kaifeng and Xuzhou by the Second and Third Route Armies of the National Army. Sun's troops were unable to defend both ends and fled Guide towards Luyi. (2) The Third Division of the National Army captured over 1,500 rifles and over 2,000 prisoners from Sun's troops in Mamuji. (3) When Sun's troops withdrew from Guide, they engaged in large-scale arson and looting. They are now fleeing towards Fancheng and Dakang. The National Army is pursuing and encircling them. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Jiang Bocheng, accompanied by Zhang Yue, Chief of Staff of Han Fuqu, arrived in Beijing. Jiang said that Han is determined to support the Central Government and will obey Chairman Jiang's orders in everything. Shi Yousan and Han have a deep personal friendship and can act in unison. Currently, Han's troops, along with Liu Zhi, Chen Jicheng, and other divisions, are encircling and suppressing Sun Dianying's army and have already confiscated over half of their weapons. The rest will be resolved within days. Han's troops are currently stationed around Kaifeng, Guide, Zhongmu, and Lanfeng, while Shi's troops are stationed around Zhangde, Weihui, and Xinxiang. Only a small part of the Northwest Army has arrived in Luoyang. The Longhai Railway is fully open to traffic. He will go to Kaifeng again after reporting to Chairman Jiang upon his return to Beijing. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important person received a telegram from Han Fuqu on the 23rd, stating that the situation here is tense and his troops are currently suppressing the fleeing soldiers of Sun Dianying. The troop strength in Bian is weak and it is difficult to cope. He requested that the situation here be reported to the Commander-in-Chief and that the Central Army be ordered to advance westward as soon as possible in order to cope with the situation. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Hai Tao, acting on Jiang's orders, came to Xuzhou from Beijing and will go to Liu River to meet with Han Fuqu as soon as the train is open to traffic, to discuss matters. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Great Wall and Yunnan-Guizhou armored trains returned to Xuzhou from the western patrol and then went west again to Mamuji for a road test. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Jiang Is Scheduled to Go to Hangzhou Today</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) Zhang Jingjiang went to Fenghua on the afternoon of the 23rd with Chen Bulei and Shen Shiyuan of the Provincial Committee to meet with Jiang and discuss important matters.

<p>(Nanjing) The Beijing Garrison Department announced on the 25th that a certain important person in Jin said that Yan's betrayal of the Central Government has been preparing for half a year. He has secretly communicated with Wu, Duan, and the Anfu clique in peacetime and is unwilling to accept the Party Constitution, political program, and demobilization resolutions. His relationship with the Gui clique and the Reorganization clique is superficial and difficult to cooperate with thoroughly. This time, the alliance with Feng to send troops originally intended to organize a government in Ping, but due to the harsh environment, Zhang Xueliang insisted on upholding the Central Government for the sake of thorough peace. Part of the force has entered the customs and is stationed around Luanzhou. The Jin army is also deploying troops and building fortifications on the line of Lutai and Tanggu. The discord between Jin and Liao can be proven. After Feng returned to Shaanxi, he ostensibly sent troops to attack Hubei and demanded military pay and weapons from Yan, secretly attempting to gain control of Pingjin in order to obtain a Tianjin port. The cooperation between Yan and Feng is only a temporary collusion based on interests. Moreover, there is internal division within Yan, with Jinnan and Jinbei, civil governance and strength, old age and youth, and Jin factions and non-Jin factions all vying for power in secret. Therefore, the Jin army's mobilization has lasted for more than a month and has not yet taken a step out of Hebei. It is said that Yan has many hidden worries, and when it is absolutely necessary, he may abandon Pingjin and defend Nankou in the north and Jingxing in the east. (25th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Two Problems Faced by Japan in Its Hesitation</h3>
<p>Since Japan discovered the phenomenon of industrial and commercial decline, the authorities realized that it was not a long-term solution to maintain a tight fiscal policy. There was discussion about abandoning the passive approach and adopting a proactive policy. However, to implement a proactive policy, there must be sufficient financial resources. Now that it is difficult to borrow money and difficult to increase taxes, there is no way to develop financial resources. Therefore, the government is hesitant between supporting a passive fiscal policy and changing to a proactive one.</p>
<p>At the Naval Conference, since the United States proposed a compromise plan, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had the intention of making slight concessions after consulting with the representative, Wakatsuki. For the sake of national defense, the Ministry of the Navy believed that the original plan must be adhered to. Since the internal views of the Cabinet authorities were not consistent and the situation at the Naval Conference was such that various countries were unwilling to compromise, they had to take a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, with regard to the Naval Conference, they were also hesitant between adhering to the original plan and making concessions to compromise.</p>
<p>The former concerns the future of the national economy and livelihood, while the latter concerns the future of national defense and military affairs. The dangers, benefits, and interests are all very significant, and it is impossible not to be more cautious. However, from an outsider's point of view, the dangers, benefits, and interests of these two matters are closely related and can be combined into one issue. One resolution can solve both. Why is this? Today, to save the declining trend of industry and commerce with a proactive policy, the difficulty lies in the inability to improve the financial situation. Instead of piecemeal efforts to scrape and reduce, which are still ineffective, why not seek to reduce the large expenditure on military expenses? To achieve the goal of reducing military expenses, nothing is better than making slight concessions at the Naval Conference. If a satisfactory solution can be reached between Japan and the United States, it may be possible to arouse the sincerity of other countries, who may also express concessions, so that this Naval Conference, which is as precarious as a pile of eggs, can actually turn the situation around and achieve hope for peace. It is not impossible. If we have no intention of invading others, others will naturally have no intention of attacking us. If suspicions are eliminated, not only can naval expenses be saved, but army expenses can also be reduced as a result. Transferring this huge amount of money to be used for improving the financial situation and saving the declining trend of industry and commerce can be guaranteed to achieve considerable results and not be as helpless as it is today. If this can be done, not only can Japan's own dilemma be resolved, but the world will also benefit from it. Otherwise, once the conference breaks down, it will inevitably compete with various countries in building warships, expanding armaments, and increasing military expenses, thereby increasing the burden on the people. As a result, the difficulty of people's lives, the decline of industry and commerce, and the inability to manage finances may be even worse than the current situation. But it is unknown whether the Japanese authorities, who are hesitating, have even a slight awareness of this.</p>

<h3>Naval Conference Remains Stalled</h3>
<p>Rumors of a Proposal by the Italian Representative to Adjourn for Two Months</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th It is reported that some have suggested that a tripartite agreement be concluded between the three powers, Britain, the United States, and Japan, and that the naval conference be adjourned for two months. During these two months, the French and Italian governments should seek a peaceful understanding and undertake not to build any more warships at the same time. It is also reported that the proposal reported in the newspapers was made by Italian Foreign Minister Grandi.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th The current status of the naval conference remains unchanged. The five-power agreement is still the basis for discussion. The suggestion of a two-month adjournment, which was rumored this morning, is merely a preliminary proposal to be considered in the event of certain circumstances. However, such circumstances have not yet arisen. The head of the delegation convened a meeting at 5:30 PM today to consider the overall situation of the conference. The Football Association has invited representatives from the naval conference to attend the England vs. Scotland football match on April 5, and most of the representatives have accepted the invitation, which is noteworthy.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th British First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander gave a speech in London today, saying that there is no reason to be pessimistic about the naval conference. It has not only not failed, but can be expected to make tangible progress in some areas. The British Prime Minister is now making every effort to promote a five-power agreement, and all participating countries recognize the sincerity of Britain's support. Since all countries have made solemn declarations against war, why can't the representatives who came to London specifically for disarmament reach an agreement?</p>
<p>French Government Recalls Naval Chief</p>
<p>National Society, Paris, 24th The French government suddenly recalled Naval Chief of Staff Dumenil from London. This is the first result of the British Ambassador's contact with Briand to continue attending the naval conference.</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador to Japan Visits Shidehara</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 25th U.S. Ambassador to Japan Cameron Forbes visited Foreign Minister Shidehara yesterday afternoon to inquire about the Japanese government's views on the U.S.-Japan compromise proposal and to urge its promotion.</p>
<p>Japan Returns Instruction to Cabinet Discussion</p>
<p>Japan Alliance, Tokyo, 25th The Japanese government's response to Ambassador Wakatsuki's instructions was reported in detail by Foreign Minister Shidehara at the Cabinet meeting on the 25th, along with the opinions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (based on the draft response proposed by the Ministry of the Navy, which had already been approved by the Council of Marshals and Military Advisors). The cabinet ministers expressed their opinions one after another, but the two departments, the Ministry of the Navy and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, still had two or three important points that were not completely consistent, so no decision was made. The final decision seems to rest with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>Comments from Tokyo Newspapers</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 25th Today, major newspapers in Tokyo commented on the recent developments in the disarmament conference. The Jiji Shimpo said that the remaining issue between Japan and the United States is how to deal with three large cruisers. However, it is absolutely unacceptable for the United States to reserve the right to increase from fifteen to eighteen, as this violates the fundamental spirit of disarmament. The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun said that regardless of the relationship between France and Italy, the three countries of Britain, the United States, and Japan should make this disarmament conference a success, not only as a political agreement, but also in the broad sense of lasting peace in the Pacific, economic cooperation, and diplomacy toward China. A friendly relationship between Britain, the United States, and Japan should be established, and it is not necessary to worry about the length of the conference, and efforts should be made to achieve results without being constrained by the duration of the conference. The Kokumin Shimbun said that the United States, in order to ease Japan's request for 70% parity, proposed to recognize Japan's preferential rights in China and the Western Pacific. Negotiations between Japan and the United States seem to have made great progress. This proposal by the United States has a substantial and significant effect on promoting peace. The Chugai Business News said that recently, negotiations between Japan and the United States regarding the security of the Far East have become concrete. Regarding the China issue, an understanding has been reached between Japan and the United States, and the United States has actively proposed to recognize Japan's superior position. Therefore, Japan's attitude toward disarmament has become somewhat more moderate.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Debates Army Budget Bill</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th The Army Budget Bill was debated in the House of Commons today, and the bill was passed at 2:00 AM this morning. Conservative MP Horovitz asked whether the reduction in expenses in Singapore indicated a change in policy. The Financial Secretary of the War Office replied that the government had not changed its policy, as the work in Singapore was not urgent at present. Horovitz also asked whether any projects had been cancelled or only delayed. The Financial Secretary replied that some expenses had already been cancelled.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th Secretary of State for War Shaw introduced the Army Budget Bill for 1930 in the House of Commons today, totaling £40 million, saving £605,000 compared to last year. Shaw claimed that the British Army would be gradually reduced to 148,000 men, and the government did not want to make further cuts without an international agreement. Shaw mentioned the extra expenses of stationing troops in China, saying that the British government's policy towards China was to sympathize with China's efforts to establish its own polity, and the British government would act in a friendly manner with other countries to ensure the safety of foreigners within and outside autonomous China. Shaw also said that there are 300 million people in India, but only 60,000 British soldiers stationed in India. During the debate, Labour left-wing MP Cove proposed an amendment, stating that all military preparations were a waste, serving only the interests of capitalist imperialism, and therefore demanded a large annual reduction in the British Army and an immediate halt to the government's funding of the Volunteer Training Corps and Officer Training Corps. However, this amendment was rejected by a vote of 274 to 21. Former Secretary of State for War Evans said that Malaya contributed £92,000 this year and New Zealand contributed £29,000 to the Singapore naval base expenses, but the current cost is only £33,000, so the War Office can get £88,000 for regular army expenses.</p>

<h3>Indian Legislative Assembly Passes Financial Bill on Third Reading</h3>
<p>Reuters, New Delhi, 24th The Indian Legislative Assembly passed the Financial Bill on its third reading today. The new taxes included in the bill are: the import tax on cotton cloth is increased from 11% to 15%, with an additional 5% protection tax on non-British cotton cloth; the import tax on silver is 4 annas per ounce; the kerosene production tax is increased from 1 anna to 1 anna and 6 pies per gallon; the kerosene import tax is reduced from 2 annas and 6 pies to 2 annas and 3 pies per gallon; the import tax on sugar is increased by 1 rupee and 8 annas; and income tax and surtax are also slightly increased. Silver exporters can receive a refund of the tax already levied. The new taxes are expected to generate a surplus of 7 million rupees. The government's finance minister said that if the kerosene industry is indeed hit by the import and production taxes, special remedies can be provided. The finance minister also promised to do his best to support the Indian sugar industry.</p>
<h3>The So-called Korean Autonomy Plan</h3>
<p>Not Autonomy for Koreans</p>
<p>But Autonomy for Japanese</p>
<p>Japanese Authorities Deceive the Korean People</p>
<p>Seoul Special Dispatch, Korean Governor-General Saito Makoto, in light of the recent fierce Korean liberation movement, has proclaimed the necessity of Korean local autonomy and has submitted a local autonomy expansion plan to the Japanese cabinet, which has already been passed and will be announced soon. All sectors of the Korean community are united in opposition to this. The content of the autonomy plan is to establish consultative councils in the fu, do, and gun levels. These institutions are nominally decision-making bodies, but in reality, they are nothing more than puppets of the Governor-General's administration. General administrative officials have so-called supervisory powers, which are extremely broad: "They have the power to cancel illegal and inappropriate resolutions, and to suspend and dissolve meetings." In other words, even if a council passes a resolution with a majority vote, the governor and mayor can arbitrarily cancel it. Conversely, councilors have no power to impeach the chairman. In addition, officials selected by the government account for one-third of all councilors, and the qualifications for councilors are limited to those who pay an annual national tax of 500 yuan or more. The areas where autonomous resolutions are implemented are limited to urban areas. All of these measures restrict Korean participation in order to allow Japanese to occupy an absolute majority. As a result, the so-called Korean autonomy is not autonomy for Koreans, but autonomy for Japanese people residing in Korea. (World Society)</p>
<h3>Tariff Truce Conference Concludes</h3>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 24th The Tariff Truce Conference held its final meeting today, dedicated to signing various documents. One was a convention to maintain existing commercial agreements unchanged for one year, signed by eleven of the thirty countries present, including Britain, France, Italy, and the Netherlands. The other was a protocol on procedures for future negotiations on a tariff truce, signed by fifteen countries. Dr. Mutsch, representing Germany, delivered a farewell speech, saying that the results of this conference had failed to meet public expectations, but economic understanding between the great powers had been brought one step closer, and that other countries would undoubtedly follow this step.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Decides to Implement New Budget for the Year</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 25th The examination and determination of the budget for the fifth year of Showa has been completed, and was decided at the regular cabinet meeting on the 25th and announced as follows: General accounting general budget estimate for the fifth year of Showa, [Revenues] unit 1000 yen, regular section 1,514,000, temporary section 92,000, general revenues 45,000, retained surplus 47,000, total 1,606,000, [Expenditures] regular section 1,224,000 temporary section 382,000, total 1,606,000. Compared to the budget that was not established for the fifth year of Showa, there is an increase of 4 million yen, but this includes an increase of 10 million yen in national treasury subsidies for compulsory education. If this amount is excluded, there is actually a decrease of 6 million yen.</p>
<h3>U.S. Tariff Bill Passes Senate</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 24th The Senate passed the new tariff bill today by a vote of 53 to 31. It is feared that this bill will inevitably encounter further obstacles after entering the House, because the bill passed by the Senate today is very different from the original bill in the House. Representative Ramseyer has strongly advocated in the House that when the bill is referred to a joint committee, the House should vote on each tariff rate on which the two houses cannot agree. From this point of view, the sugar tariff dispute will be repeated. Once the tariff bill is concluded in the Senate, the prohibition law will once again become the focus of contention.</p>
<h3>Trotsky's Illness Worsens</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th Russian figure Trotsky is currently in Constantinople, and his illness is worsening. He has telegraphed friends in Germany and elsewhere, saying that according to doctors, unless he can quickly be treated in Germany or France, there is little hope of saving his life. Trotsky's friends have applied to the German government for permission for Trotsky to enter the country for treatment, saying that they are willing to swear not to participate in political activities. In fact, such a guarantee is not necessary, because Trotsky is completely exhausted in terms of mental and physical strength.</p>
<h3>Failure of the Japanese Proletarian League</h3>
<p>Japan Alliance, Tokyo, 25th Since the major defeat in the general election, proletarian parties have begun to unite and organize. However, the Central Committee of the Social Democratic Party rejected the unification proposal of the leftist Labor-Farmer Party. Therefore, the issue of proletarian party unity and the hope of organizing a single proletarian party have completely failed. The middle-of-the-road Masses Party also intends to exclude the Labor-Farmer Party. Therefore, in the future, the issue of uniting right-wing parties such as the Masses Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the National People's Party may arise.</p>
<h3>Hungarian Foreign Minister Arrives in Ankara</h3>
<p>National Society, Ankara, 24th Hungarian Foreign Minister Dr. Walko arrived in Ankara on Monday and will stay for four days.

<h3>Coastal Zhejiang Police Wipe Out Large Group of Pirates</h3>
<p>The areas of Shangxia Dachen in Wenling County, which belongs to the Taizhou Prefecture of Zhejiang Province, are surrounded by the sea on all sides and have long been a stronghold for notorious pirates like Yin Xiaoyan and Jiang Dougao. The local residents have been in contact with them for so long that they have become accustomed to and assimilated with them. Therefore, every time the water police station sent teams to suppress the pirates, the residents always claimed that there were no pirates and everything was peaceful. In reality, the people were mixed with the pirates, making it impossible to distinguish them. This time, Wang Wenhan, the commander of the Offshore Water Police Bureau and concurrently the Anti-Piracy Commander of the four prefectures, recognizing the unrest caused by pirates in the Taizhou waters, specially dispatched Inspector Tang Lun, together with the 5th Regiment of the Zhijiao Security Force, to supervise the Haijing and Yongping patrol ships, as well as the 2nd, 6th, and 7th water patrol teams and the Security Force student company and special task company, to launch a two-pronged attack. One route, led by Inspector Tang and Regiment Commander Zhu, supervised the Haijing ship, the 2nd and 6th water patrol teams, and one platoon of the student company, to suppress the pirates at Guandi'ao in Shang Dachen. The other route, led by Inspector Ke Dejia and Deputy Regiment Commander Lü, supervised the Yongping ship, the 7th water patrol team, and the Security Force special task company, to suppress the pirates at Shangtou'ao in Shang Dachen. Both groups landed simultaneously at dawn on the 17th of this month. The pirates on the lookout immediately scattered and returned to their lairs to report. The soldiers and police bravely advanced and encountered a group of more than a hundred pirates at Bantianfei. They attacked each other and held their ground for four hours. Sixty to seventy pirates were killed on the spot, but they still resisted stubbornly. The Haijing ship then circled behind the pirates and bombarded them with cannons. The remaining pirates lost their courage and were forced into the sea, with none escaping. On the morning of the 18th, a search was conducted in the mountains and valleys of Puli in Xia Dachen. A temple was found with its doors locked, which seemed suspicious. The locks were broken, and the temple was searched. Unexpectedly, gunfire suddenly erupted. Pirate leaders Yin Xiaoyan, Jiang Dougao, Xiao Wude, and others, along with more than ten guards, were hidden inside. As soon as they saw the police and soldiers, they vigorously fired with wooden-shell guns. Although the police and soldiers surrounded the temple and attacked fiercely, the temple's stone walls were solid and difficult to destroy. Fire was then used to surround and burn the temple, and all the pirate leaders inside, including Yin Xiaoyan, were burned to death. The pirate leader Jiang Dougao rushed out through the fire and was also killed on the spot. Afterwards, the bodies were examined, and it was found that the pirate leader Yin Xiaoyan was wearing a bulletproof vest, with steel fragments still remaining in the ashes. According to statistics, more than a hundred notorious pirate leaders and pirates were wiped out in Shangxia Dachen this time. More than thirty rifles and more than ten wooden-shell pistols were seized, and more than thirty refugees were rescued. After this severe suppression, even if there are small groups of pirates in Taiwan, it will be easier to eliminate them.</p>
<h3>Excerpts from Wang Boling's Talk After Returning to the Province</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Boling arrived in the province the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he attended the provincial government's memorial service and the provincial committee meeting. I then visited his private residence and had the following conversation with Mr. Wang: (Question) Mr., what were the results of your mission to Yunnan? (Answer) Yunnan is far from the central government, and there is a lack of understanding of the situation. My trip did not achieve much in terms of the central government's tasks, and there are some things that are not convenient to announce at this time. However, since my arrival in Yunnan, Yunnan has truly become the Yunnan of the central government. This is something I can report. (Question) How long were you in Yunnan? (Answer) A full six months. I repeatedly wanted to return east, but the central government did not allow it. By the time the Third Plenary Session opened, I was still on my way back in the South China Sea. (Question) What is the situation in Annam (Vietnam)? (Answer) The late Premier's Three Principles of the People have taken deep root in the hearts of the people. The awakening of small and weak nations is an unstoppable trend. Therefore, the French paid special attention to my passing through Annam, and the French ambassador raised concerns with the central government, saying that General Wang Boling's passage through Vietnam should not involve any revolutionary actions. When I arrived in Haiphong on my return journey, there was an independence movement in Annam. The party headquarters originally asked me to hold a meeting and give a speech, but it could not be held. (Question) What is the strength of the military in Yunnan? (Answer) Two divisions can be deployed. If the central government gives the order, they can be mobilized immediately. (Question) Will you be stationed in the province permanently from now on? (Answer) The living conditions in Yunnan are too poor. I rushed back to Beijing to attend the conference. I recently suffered from a toothache and need to rest a little. I also need to make a trip to the capital to report everything to the Chairman. Tomorrow I will attend the farewell party at the Construction Department. In the afternoon, I will return to Yangzhou to visit my elderly mother. I have been running around for national affairs for half a year and have not dared to attend to my personal duty of serving my parents. I feel very uneasy about this. (Question) When will the construction of the Xiong Martyr's Memorial Hall in Yangzhou begin? (Answer) I must promote this matter when I return to Yangzhou. Fundraising from all parties has reached 30,000 yuan, which is enough to start construction. (Question) Have you completed the handover at the Construction Department? (Answer) Because of my trip to Yunnan, the construction of roads could not be implemented. I still feel regretful about this. However, fortunately, there is still one million yuan left in the construction funds for the counties, and the department's funds still have a principal and interest of more than 500,000 yuan. In the future, Director Sun can implement the original plan step by step, which can still compensate for my aspirations. As we talked to this point, other guests came to visit, so I took my leave and departed.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Influx of Japanese Fish in Quanzhou</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The Japanese are invading the fishing grounds along the coast of Fujian, and recently they have been selling their frozen fresh fish in Quanzhou, which has greatly affected the fishing industry in Quanzhou. Fishermen from various coastal counties have united to form a Fisheries Congress to discuss ways to resist this. According to an investigation by the Fisheries Union, the intrusion of frozen fish from Taiwan into Quanzhou is due to Jiang Daqing, a Taiwanese who came to Quanzhou last August and organized the Minnan Fisheries Company, claiming to revitalize the Chinese fishing industry. In reality, he specializes in hiring motorboats to transport frozen fish from Taiwan to Quanzhou for sale. At the same time, he also leads Japanese fishing vessels to fish in the waters near Quanzhou. As a result, Jiang can obtain Taiwanese fish at low cost, and the fish caught by Japanese vessels in the waters off Quanzhou are also sold by Jiang in Quanzhou. Therefore, he can manipulate the market price of fresh fish in Quanzhou. The company has three motorboats, "Minnan No. 1," "Minnan No. 2," and "Rongfa 98," each capable of carrying 600 to 800 piculs. They sell an average of 300 piculs of fish per day, with each picul priced at 30 to 40 yuan. Relying on their status as registered residents, they can evade taxes. Jiang is very active in Taiwan, and it is said that the Governor-General of Taiwan has given him a bonus of 10,000 yuan. This shows that Jiang's arrival actually contains the mission of the Japanese to invade the fishing grounds and fish market of Fujian Province. Since Jiang profited, Quanzhou merchants Su Dabing, He Danian, Cai Ruifang, and others envied him and also jointly formed the Huanan Company to transport frozen fish directly from Taiwan to Quanzhou for sale. Later, the Quanzhou Fish Guilds Xiesheng, Heyi, and Shunxing also jointly formed a company and hired the Japanese vessel Xirong Maru to transport fish from Taiwan. A few fishmongers in Quanzhou, Zeng Shitou and Mao Hui, also formed the Minxing Company to transport fish from Taiwan. As a result, the Japanese plan to invade the fresh fish market in Quanzhou gradually succeeded. Since June and July, Quanzhou has been flooded with frozen fish, and our country's fishing industry, which adheres to the law, has suffered a setback. Moreover, the Taiwanese fish that come to Quanzhou are mostly bream, whale sharks, and various small fish. It is difficult to effectively freeze larger fish. The fishing boats sail and the fish stalls store the fish for more than two weeks. After arriving in Quanzhou, the fish merchants' freezing equipment is not complete, and the fish often thaws and rots internally, which is also very unhygienic.</p>
<p>Since the coastal fishermen of Quanzhou united to form a Fisheries Union, they have been proceeding with resistance after filing with the Jinjiang Finger Committee. The first step was to send letters to the associations, ordering all fish merchants not to transport Taiwanese fish. The second step was to raise funds to organize a fishery cooperative, purchase fishing boats, and set up freezing cabinets to catch and store fish using new methods to avoid natural elimination. The first step has gradually achieved results, and the amount of frozen fish in Quanzhou has decreased in recent weeks. The second step is also being actively prepared. (March 21st)</p>

Witnesses Chen Jianmin, Yao Chengwen, and Wu Yucang were summoned, along with defense attorneys Wu Chengyu, Lu Xiangru, Chen Liren, and Xu Bingcheng. Judge Lin Dawen, Prosecutor Du Fuyue, and Clerk Zhu Xiongwu opened the trial at 2:10 PM, examining each person one by one. The hearing concluded at 3:15 PM. The details of each person's testimony are recorded below in order:</p>
<p>Gu Ziyang: The judge asked about the letters of accusation from Zhang Zhihui, Wang Dechun, Huang Zhenya, and others. The Civil Affairs Department has sent the original letters. Take a look at them. Gu replied, "I don't know Zhang Zhihui. I don't even know if he exists. He said that Duan Muzhen went to Xuzhou on my orders to convene a Communist Party meeting, but I didn't send him there. I don't know if he went or not. Duan Muzhen was on a mission from the Provincial Party Headquarters to arrest one or two hundred communists. The communists hated him the most. This letter of accusation is probably fabricated by the communists. It's also possible." The judge asked, "Look at the original letters from Wang Dechun and Huang Zhenya again." Gu replied, "If these people are real, why don't they list their addresses? The Civil Affairs Department didn't clarify this either. Under these circumstances, it's probably fabricated by Miao Bin to frame people. What exactly happened? Please summon Miao Bin for confrontation."</p>
<p>Witness Yao Chengwen: The judge asked, "Are you related to Ge Shangde?" Yao replied, "No." The judge asked, "Is Ge Shangde's reply to your letter correct?" Yao replied, "Yes, it's a reply to the letter I gave him." The judge asked, "Why did you give him a letter?" Yao replied, "Because at that time, the Taicang Supervisory Committee was falsely accused by the Executive Committee. The supervisors wanted to file a counter-suit against them. I was instructed to draft a statement of appeal. I wrote a letter to Ge Shangde in my personal capacity, asking him if he wanted to file a counter-suit." The judge asked, "Does the 'untimely moment' mentioned in the letter, 'postpone the launch,' refer to the counter-suit?" Yao replied, "Yes."</p>
<p>Ge Shangde: The judge asked, "Is what the witness said correct?" Ge replied, "Yes. Wu Yucang has also arrived now."</p>
<p>Witness Wu Yucang: The judge asked, "What position do you currently hold?" Wu replied, "Taicang County Party Reorganization Committee Member." The judge asked, "Are you related to Ge Shangde?" Wu replied, "No." The judge asked, "What position did you hold before?" Wu replied, "Taicang County Supervisory Committee Member." The judge asked, "Have you ever been accused to the Provincial Party Headquarters?" Wu replied, "I have been accused to the Provincial Party Headquarters many times by the Executive Committee." The judge asked, "Did you file a counter-suit?" Wu replied, "I also filed a few counter-suits." The judge asked, "Did you ever ask Yao Chengwen to write a letter?" Wu replied, "I asked him to draft a submission for appeal to higher authorities. As for his communication with Ge Shangde about the counter-suit, I didn't know at the time, but I remember that he later told me about it." The judge asked, "Have you seen the contents of Ge Shangde's letter to Yao Chengwen?" Wu replied, "I haven't seen it in detail yet, but I was detained in the Taicang County Public Security Bureau and subjected to torture due to being framed by the Executive Committee. The Public Security Bureau Chief once told me about it." The judge asked, "Does the 'untimely moment' mentioned in Ge Shangde's letter, 'postpone the launch,' refer to the Supervisory Committee's counter-suit against the Executive Committee?" Wu replied, "Ge Shangde's letter to Yao Chengwen was at the time of the Taicang Supervisory Committee's counter-suit. Moreover, judging from the tone of the letter, the court should understand."</p>
<p>Ge Shangde: The judge asked, "Is what Wu Yucang said correct?" Ge replied, "Yes. Regarding this letter, please pay attention to two points. One is that there were indeed disputes in the Taicang County Party Headquarters. The second is that the letter refers to internal disputes within the Taicang Party Headquarters. As long as you look at the context, you can understand. This letter has no reactionary suspicion whatsoever."</p>
<p>Ge Jianshi: The judge asked, "Is what the two comrades said correct?" Ge replied, "Correct." Ni Bi: The judge asked, "Regarding the evidence, it has been investigated. Do you have any requests for further investigation? Regarding the Shi Hanqing matter mentioned in the previous hearing, it was said that you were close to him." Ni replied, "How do you define 'close'? What is the legal meaning of that? What is the basis for the fact of being close? It can't be based on what Miao Bin said. That can't be evidence." The judge asked, "Do you know Shi Hanqing?" Ni replied, "He is a county party committee member. I am a provincial party committee member. Of course, there is a relationship of subordination in terms of duties, but there is no personal relationship." The judge asked, "Is there anything else you want to request for investigation?" Ni replied, "Since Miao Bin became the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province, his despicable conduct has been widely known. All party members and the people of the province hate him to the bone. I was a member of the Provincial Party Headquarters. The Provincial Party Headquarters is in a position to supervise the administrative organs. Therefore, we often pointed out his erroneous measures, so he harbors resentment towards us and retaliates under the guise of suspicion. When the prosecutor opened the investigation hearing for the first time, Miao Bin accused us of ten counts, and the prosecutor said that there was evidence, but it was not sent. I immediately said to the prosecutor, 'If there is evidence, and we have been arrested and detained in Zhenjiang for a month, why isn't it sent?' The prosecutor said, 'His official document said that there must be evidence.' Now the court has sent a letter to urge him to produce it. Later, at the second investigation hearing, more than twenty days had passed, that is, it was almost two months since we were arrested, and the evidence had not yet been sent. It was not sent until after the indictment, around the end of February. At this time, it had been three months since we were arrested. After repeated urging from the court, this kind of thing was finally sent. Among them, dozens of absurd words were listed. The only one that is related to the defendant is that I am close to the famous reorganizationist Shi Hanqing. The dates of these copied documents are all between October and November of last year, that is, before we were arrested. Why was this thing not sent until three months later, and after the court had repeatedly urged it? It can be seen that there is a lot of suspicion of forgery and framing under the guise of suspicion, so I want to ask the court to summon him to the court for confrontation, so that the truth can be revealed. Even if the court does not adopt the evidence he said, in order to clarify the facts, the defendant must also request that he be summoned to the court for confrontation to show the truth." The judge asked, "Did Shi Hanqing live in the Provincial Party Headquarters in Zhenjiang, or did he live in your house? Is that true?" Ni replied, "I lived in the Jinshan Temple monastery in Zhenjiang, far away from the Provincial Party Headquarters. I was just a temporary resident in the temple and had no family there. That is very wrong."</p>
<p>Wang Zhiren: The judge asked, "Are you and Lu Yinquan from the same hometown and classmates?" Wang replied, "Yes, but we were classmates several years ago." The judge asked, "After Lu Yinquan left the Provincial Party Headquarters, did you have any contact with him?" Wang replied, "Since he left the Provincial Party Headquarters, there has been no contact." The judge asked, "Was this time the only time you sent him a letter? Is there any other political relationship?" Wang replied, "There is no other relationship. I just advised him to send a few dollars home every month to support his parents."</p>
<p>Gu Shuyin: The judge asked, "Do you have a lot of contact with Fang Yuanmin?" Gu replied, "Fang Yuanmin came to work in the Training Department of the Provincial Party Headquarters in the 18th year [of the Republic of China], and I came to work in the Training Department of the Provincial Party Headquarters before the 17th year. Not only is there no contact, but I don't even know him. Since working in the same department, apart from a brief meeting due to work-related matters, there has been no contact at all." Chen Baixin: The judge asked, "Are you related to Wang Bochun?" Chen replied, "Regarding this point, the defendant has repeatedly explained in detail in court. Due to colleagues, we know each other, but there is no so-called contact." The judge asked, "Regarding the evidence, is there any request for investigation?" Chen replied, "No, because the matter is very clear. The so-called contact is very vague and not worth investigating at all."</p>
<p>Attorney Chen Liren stated, "The Director of the Civil Affairs Department replied to your court with copied documents and added six points of opinion, saying that there are many points of reactionary suspicion. However, after examining the letters from Zhang Zhihui and others, there is no definite address. It is nothing more than anonymous letters. What is the basis for Director Miao's so-called reactionary suspicion? It is necessary to summon Director Miao to court for confrontation." Attorney Lu Xiangru stated, "The central government decided to apply the jury law to this case, but only for the sake of caution. In fact, Article 3 of the jury law is limited to cases that are returned or sent for a new trial. Since there is a legally promulgated jury law, the central government cannot change the law with the phrase 'apply the jury law system.' Please conclude this case as soon as possible in accordance with the law." Attorney Xu Bingcheng stated, "This case was reported by the Director of the Civil Affairs Department. It is necessary to summon Director Miao to court." Attorney Lu further stated, "Although the Civil Affairs Department has sent the original letters of Zhang Zhihui and others to the court, it has not disclosed their addresses. It is impossible to know whether these people exist. Even if they do, there is no way to summon them. Please pay attention." Attorney Wu Chengyu stated, "Under party rule, the power of the party is higher than the power of the government. Now the party committee appears in court as the defendant, which shows respect for the judiciary. Miao Bin, the former Director of the Civil Affairs Department, is the plaintiff, and he should also appear in court so that the case can be brought to light as soon as possible." He also said, "I have read three letters of evidence. Two of them have the same handwriting, and one was sent from Zhenjiang, but the signatory is more than two hundred citizens of Tongshan. Both of these points are suspicious. If it is considered necessary to adopt them, it is necessary to summon Director Miao to court."</p>
<h3>Longhai Train Robbed at Bayiji</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Bandits are rampant in eastern Xuzhou. The First Division has repeatedly sent teams to suppress them, and the bandits have dispersed separately. However, the bandits appear and disappear unpredictably, and gatherings and dissolutions are uncertain. Disturbances and robberies still occur from time to time. Yesterday (the 22nd), a train robbery occurred again on the eastern section of the ticket train at Bayiji Station. Fortunately, no one was injured and no roads were destroyed. In the morning of that day, the second ticket train from Haizhou to Xuzhou, with three third-class passenger cars and seven or eight freight cars, arrived at Bayiji Station at about 8:00 PM. At that time, a widow named So-and-so in Bayiji, because her son was abducted by bandits a month ago, and she entrusted someone to negotiate a price for redemption, transported dozens of stones of high-quality grain to Xuzhou for sale, hoping to obtain the money to redeem her son. She loaded the grain on the train at this station. Because loading the goods took time, the inspector escorting the train warned that the area was unsafe and that it was not advisable to stop for too long. However, before the goods were fully loaded, fifty or sixty bandits sneaked onto the train. First, one or two disguised bandits inquired if there were any military police escorting the train. The people at the station told them that there were none. The bandits did not pay attention to this and swarmed into the passenger cars, brandishing pistols and sharp blades, threatening the passengers not to make a sound and robbing them one by one. It is estimated that the fifty or sixty passengers lost about one thousand yuan in cash and about one thousand yuan in clothes and luggage. After the robbery, the bandits got off the train and fled. At that time, the people at the station were not aware of the incident, and the passengers were also panicked and afraid to make a sound. After the train started, the ticket inspector found out that the passengers had been robbed. The bandits had already fled far away. The train did not arrive at Xuzhou Station until 12:00 at night. It is said that one railway worker was fast asleep on the upper bunk in the carriage when the robbery occurred and was not seen by the bandits, so he was lucky enough to escape. It is said that the bandits were all in plain clothes and mostly spoke with a local accent. Fortunately, no roads were destroyed and no one was injured, otherwise the losses would have been even greater. (March 23rd)</p>
<h3>Hunan Province Advocates National Goods Conference</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: In order to awaken the people to advocate national goods and resist foreign goods, the various circles of Hunan Province, initiated and convened by the Provincial Party Headquarters and the Provincial Government, gathered representatives from various agencies and groups to hold a meeting and decided to organize the Hunan People's National Goods Promotion Movement Committee. Huang Jing, Huang Yunlong, Yuan Zhang, and fifteen others were elected as organizers. A conference was held at the Provincial Education Association at 10:00 AM on the 23rd. More than 40,000 people attended. After performing the rituals, Chairman He Jian first reported the purpose of the meeting, saying that the national goods promotion movement is a national salvation movement. In other words, it means not buying foreign goods and using domestic goods. However, there are many domestic goods that cannot meet the demand, so we should all work together to focus on production. Food, clothing, housing, and transportation should all be able to meet the needs. Only then can the promotion of national goods be achieved. On the one hand, we should implement tariff autonomy and increase taxes on foreign goods so that domestic goods can be sold smoothly. Moreover, everyone should develop the habit of loving and using national goods and prevent leakage so that the country can become rich and strong. After He's report, more than ten people from various circles, including Tan Changkai, Zhang Kailian, and Zuo Yizhai, spoke one after another, generally advocating national goods negatively, actively setting up factories, and preventing the intrusion of foreign goods. Next, the chairman presented the conference's circular telegram and proposals and read them item by item, which were unanimously passed. Finally, the entire audience shouted slogans and dispersed. Subsequently, more than 240 propaganda teams from various agencies, groups, and schools carried propaganda materials and set off in four districts, east, west, south, and north, to carry out propaganda, which lasted until 6:00 PM. All stores and households posted slogans of "Promote National Goods" at their doors. The conference's circular telegram and proposals are recorded below: (Circular Telegram) "Since the end of the Qing Dynasty, the national power has declined, and the Eastern and Western powers have taken the opportunity to invade and oppress us heavily, causing great pain. Economic aggression is especially vicious. Sucking blood and marrow, the people are poor and the wealth is exhausted. This is a weapon that kills without bloodshed and is the only tool used by imperialists to destroy small and weak nations. Now, gold is expensive and silver is cheap, and foreign goods are expensive, which is a good opportunity to promote national goods. It is what the people of the whole country should actively strive for. I hope that all compatriots across the country will take advantage of this opportunity to revitalize industry, open up the natural wealth, and save the dying people's livelihood. The Party and the country are fortunate. The Hunan People's National Goods Promotion Movement Conference kowtows and prints." (Proposals) (1) Please ask the government to restore the paper mill and the labor suit factory. (2) Please ask the government to hold a product exhibition as soon as possible. (3) Please ask the government to issue a general order to reduce or exempt taxes on all domestic products. (4) Please ask the government party headquarters to order all public officials and party affairs workers to use domestic goods. (5) Please ask the Provincial Party Headquarters to strictly supervise merchants to promote the National Goods Association, continue its work, and implement the promotion of national goods. (6) Please ask the Party Headquarters to order merchant groups to organize a National Goods Evaluation Committee.</p>
<h3>The North Manchurian Market Where the Powers Compete</h3>
<p>With Britain, the United States, Japan, France, Russia, Germany, and Italy Investing the Most</p>
<p>Total Investment Has Reached Over 100 Million US Dollars</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Manchuria is the Balkans of the East. A second world war is likely to break out due to the Manchurian problem. This is especially evident after the occurrence of the Chinese Eastern Railway problem. In recent years, the powers have focused their attention on Manchuria and have been investing in it in succession, becoming increasingly fierce. According to the latest foreign reports, the investment situation of various countries is as follows: (1) Soviet Russia: The total investment has reached 40 million US dollars, and the annual use of funds is about 75 million US dollars. (2) Japan: The total investment is 19.9 million yuan, and the annual use of funds is quite substantial. (3) Britain: British investment in enterprises totals 20 million US dollars, and the annual use of funds is about 51 million US dollars. In Harbin alone, there are as many as twenty-seven British enterprises. British merchants are very active. (4) United States: The commercial investment is about 4.5 million US dollars, and the use of funds far exceeds that of other countries, reaching 10 million US dollars per year. In the three northeastern provinces, there are twenty-six American commercial organizations. (5) Germany: There are twenty-two German commercial organizations, with a total investment of about 3 million US dollars and an annual use of funds of 8 million US dollars. (6) France: The total investment is 6 million US dollars, and the use of funds is 15 million US dollars. (7) Italy: Italy has no significant activities in Manchuria, but its investment has already reached 400,000 US dollars, which is a new investment in recent years. The use of funds has also reached 2 million US dollars. In the future, Italy's economic influence in northern Manchuria will be no less than that of other countries. (8) Other countries: The total investment has reached 1 million US dollars, and the use of funds is 7 million US dollars. (9) The total investment of White Russians has reached 11.25 million US dollars, surpassing the powers. However, it is feared that it will not be able to continue to develop in the future. Overall, foreign investment in Manchuria totals 11.25 million US dollars, and the annual use of funds reaches 400 million US dollars. Due to the increasing investment of the powers, the economic power of Chinese merchants is completely in the hands of foreigners, and the profits and losses of their businesses are all dependent on foreign merchants. It is very painful to talk about it.</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Details of Lake Bandits' Looting of Zhangpu Town: Zhangpu Town in this county has always been an area where lake bandits frequently appear. On the 22nd, over 300 households and businesses in the entire town were completely looted by a large gang of two to three hundred lake bandits. The losses amounted to over 200,000 [currency unit]. Two people were killed, and 57 men, women, old, and young were kidnapped. The details of the looting at that time are recorded as follows: At 2:00 PM on the 23rd, more than ten large boats suddenly arrived at the South Great Bridge of the town. As the residents were still wondering, the bandits immediately gave an order. Over two hundred bandits rushed ashore, each with red cloth wrapped around their arms and holding small red flags, box cannons, pistols, machine guns, and rifles. They quickly set up sentry posts and separately attacked the security team and the public security bureau, seizing one box cannon and eight rifles. After seizing the firearms, the bandits went to the Seventh District Office, destroyed the telephone, and then searched and looted each household and business. All items of any value were completely looted. The looting ended at 6:00 PM. Before leaving, they fired a volley of shots, killing one farmer, Ma Sizhang, and one security team squad leader, Li Zengying. They kidnapped four security team members, one police officer, and 52 residents, including Chen Weizhang, Yi Yifan, Wen Xingqiao, Zeng Shixian, and Zeng Tangshi. They set sail from the North Great Bridge towards the Wusong River. The county water police team and the provincial water public security team received the report and rushed to suppress them, but the bandits had already fled far away. The county government sent a trial officer, Chen Ying, to conduct an investigation. Currently, Luo Xingwei of the district and Shen Guangdi, the director of the Public Security Sub-bureau, are handling the aftermath. None of the kidnapped people have been released yet.</p>
<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>Performing Movies to Raise Men's Rights: On March 16th, the Farmers' Education Center and the Public Library held an opening ceremony at the Minglun Hall. In the afternoon, a recreational gathering was held to entertain guests. Unexpectedly, when the movie was screened in the evening, cries of "Down with oppression of men, raise men's rights" suddenly arose in the hall. It was extremely loud. It is said that the reason for this matter was that a certain gentleman from the Farmers' Reorganization Association believed that the hall director only set up women's seating in the Minglun Hall, while men were made to stand in the open air without seats. After a negotiation, no solution was provided. Therefore, the call to raise men's rights was met with a hundred responses. The entire hall was in turmoil. Subsequently, Director Huang came out to apologize sincerely, and everyone calmed down. It was also a strange drama. First Administrative Conference of the County Government: County Magistrate Feng, in order to promote the progress of government affairs, convened fair people from all walks of life and leaders of various institutions, according to regulations, and scheduled the first county-wide administrative conference to be held on the 20th of this month.

In addition, police teams have been dispatched to the junction of Songjiang and Jinshan counties to prevent bandits from escaping. However, due to the lack of patrol boats in the county police team, the water defense is being handled by Team Leader Ding Zhiyan, who has sent a letter to Wang, the team leader of the water police detachment stationed in the south, to take charge of patrols. It has been agreed to organize a water and land patrol office to oversee the situation.</p>

<p>Record of the Meeting of the Gui Character Land Registry: In Xiyi County, land registry documents have traditionally been divided into Yi and Gui characters. Yesterday, the Gui character land registrars held a general meeting at the Yuyingtang in front of the New Temple, with over a hundred people attending. The meeting resolved: (1) Special donation: It was previously agreed that each thousand mu of land would be donated five jiao. However, this is far from the budget.

(2) The monthly report form issued by the Finance Bureau will be issued every three months. In the future, each map must pay attention. The form for each period must be sent five days before the start of the next period. It is said that the Yi character land registrars have also scheduled a meeting. Good News from the Silk Market: Wuxi silk factories recently received a telegram from Shanghai that the sale of foreign silk is quite active. Japanese silk factories, after receiving government assistance, have seen the Yokohama silk market trending firmly. Wuxi silk factories, such as Jinji, Yongtai, and Qian Sheng, have been selling in the past three days, and the market has risen by about ten taels compared to before. Jin Shuanglu brand is at 1,350 taels, and Shuang Tiaowu is at 1,185 taels. Wuxi still has a total of 50,000 packages of cocoons in stock, about 16,000 dan, which is enough to supply until the new cocoons are on the market.</p>
<p>All Kinds of Embellishments to the Lake and Mountain Scenery: This county has beautiful mountains and clear waters, and the scenery is natural. Since County Magistrate and Director of the Municipal Preparatory Office Sun Zuji urged local people to actively reorganize and refresh, all famous scenic spots and historical sites have been completely renewed. Recently, he has also been carefully embellishing the area around the lake. From the lakeside of Kaiyuan Township to Xiaojishan, a lake embankment has been built, about two li long and about three zhang wide, which can accommodate three cars side by side. Soil is currently being filled and paved, and it will be completed soon. A swimming pool is also being built in front of Xiaojishan, and construction has begun recently. In addition, the Xianlitan Great Bridge, which is the main road from the city to the lakeside, was also built by County Magistrate Sun, who raised 25,000 yuan to order the chief of the fourth district of the township, Zhu Biao, to engage in construction. It will also be completed and opened to traffic for tourists within days. All the township roads in the township have been completed, with a total length of more than 130 li, making transportation very convenient. In addition, Gaozi Water Residence on the lakeside of Wuli Lake is a famous historical site in the county, with excellent scenery. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by fire several years ago. County Magistrate Sun also found a way to hire workers to build it and restore its original appearance.

<p>Xie Long Pawnshop Closure Dispute: The Xie Long Pawnshop in Xixiashu, Wuyi County, has been operating well for many years. Last year, after shareholder Yun Jijing introduced Xu Guanyi as the manager, Xu misappropriated pawn funds and secretly engaged in stock exchange. By the New Year this year, he could not avoid the pawnshop. After checking the accounts, it was discovered that he had lost more than 30,000 yuan, resulting in no one being responsible and the pawnshop being closed. The shareholders believed that Xu was recommended by Yun, and Yun Jijing should be responsible for repaying the losses. As a result, opinions were divided, causing the pawnshop to remain closed for a long time. The Third District Office and the Business Sub-office of the town believe that last year's famine and the current period of scarcity, and the fact that February is the expiration date for pawns, have caused great panic among the people. They have sent letters to the shareholders, asking them to quickly find a way to resume business in order to avoid turmoil.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Detained Rice Not Allowed to Be Released: Rice merchant Chen Jingui purchased 1,000 stones of rice on behalf of Nantong Dada Company. As the rice successively passed through Jiangyin, the county detained it due to the cargo license. It was also heard that there were situations of paying wharf donations and black fees. The Public Security Bureau was ordered to investigate. Yesterday (23rd), an employee, Tang Jin, went to investigate, but there has been no reply yet. Zhu Bo of the Da Yun Company said that the rice had been issued a passport No. 2 by Nantong, with a sea ticket for 500 stones, and each set of rice was 320 stones (including 80 stones of white rice and 240 stones of glutinous rice). When the ship arrived in Jiangyin, the passport tax ticket invoice was entrusted to the Business Reorganization Association to present to the county for inspection and release, but it has not been released. Inquiries have been made repeatedly, but there is no news. Nantong urgently needs rice. The Nantong County Office specially submitted a request to County Magistrate Shen, asking him to release the rice immediately to avoid delays. County Magistrate Shen approved the request, but refused to release the rice because various suspected sales had not been verified. Arson Attempt After Robbery: The homes of various major merchants in Chuanli Zhangjiaxiang near Yunting were wealthy. On the night of the 22nd, more than 30 bandits broke in to rob and extorted large sums of money unsuccessfully. The bandits then set fire to ten houses on both sides, three oxen, several piglets, and more than a thousand trees. The bandits then fled.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>New Wu County Magistrate Scheduled to Take Office: This county's County Magistrate Zhang was ordered to be transferred to Rugao and left office yesterday. The new Wu County Magistrate is scheduled to arrive in Danyang on the 26th of this month to take office.</p>
<p>Change of the Chief of the Eighth Public Security Sub-bureau: Yu Yinhuai, the chief of the Lingkou Eighth Public Security Sub-bureau, has not yet gone to the province for the exam, and intends to avoid it. The Department of Civil Affairs has reassigned Huang Zhenhua, a graduate of the police academy, to take over, and the county has been notified.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Price and Rights Dispute of Changshunfa Store: Huang Jinxian, the owner of Changshunfa Timber Store in Xinhe, failed in business and owed various money houses in this port more than 130,000 taels of silver. On the 25th of last month, he secretly took away the store's important account books, seals, and timber prices and fled without a trace. The money houses applied to the court for provisional attachment of the store, which still had a large amount of timber, and requested the arrest of Huang Jinxian to bring him to justice. However, the Shanghai Yuanji Guiyuan's 56 tael mortgage claim was suddenly discovered. The Shanghai Yuanji had already requested the court to provisionally attach the store's timber. The creditors in Zhenjiang thoroughly investigated Changshunfa Store and found that there was no Shanghai Yuanji's 50,000 tael account name in the 19-year ledger and copied accounts that Huang Jinxian had handed over with fellow townsmen of the Han gang. It was believed that Shanghai Yuanji had colluded with Huang Jinxian, suspected of defrauding the creditors. The court yesterday summoned all the merchants in the town to attend the hearing. The merchants in the town paid close attention to this case. After the plaintiff and defendant submitted documents proving and stating their reasons, the lawyers from both sides began to debate. The plaintiff requested that the part of the timber that Yuanji had already requested for provisional attachment be further provisionally attached pending resolution. Near 6:00 PM, the judge announced an adjournment and rescheduled the retrial.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Two Lives Killed in Theft at Daqiao Market: Zhu Fashun and his granddaughter, both residents behind Tongjia Lane on Daqiao East Street, were attacked in their home by several thieves with knives at Zike (11 PM - 1 AM) on the morning of the 22nd and hacked to death. His wife was also seriously injured by knives and is in critical condition. The Fifth District Office has sent personnel to investigate the crime scene and track down the perpetrators and has reported the investigation to the county government for investigation.</p>
<p>Yangguan Blocked and Sank a Bean-Carrying Boat: Tan Kuizi's boat, loaded with eighty-odd stones of soybeans from Renheji, Bao Ying, was transporting them to Yangzhou. After paying taxes at Yangguan outside the customs, it was waiting to sail to Jiangnan this morning (24th). Unexpectedly, the customs blocker delayed until 7:30 AM before releasing it, causing the ship to collide with the customs blocker under the urgent pressure of the Yungang River. The ship was completely sunk by the customs blocker. Boatman Tan Bili, Tan Bizhi, and a twelve-year-old boy fell into the water at the same time, but fortunately they were rescued and did not drown.</p>

<h3>Funing</h3>
<p>Order to the County to Investigate the North Sand Reactionary Case: In Funing's North Sand Town, reactionary elements incited the members of the secret society to riot, destroy the town office, tear down the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, insult public officials, ransack the post office, schools, and the town chief's private residence, and assault travelers. The county government dispatched a flying team to arrest them. The members of the secret society gathered a mob to resist arrest and besieged the garrison of the county police reserve team. Team Leader Li, who was ordered to comply with the arrest, saw the situation and sent a rider to return to request assistance. The team headquarters then dispatched cavalry and infantry teams to rush to the scene overnight to ensure safety. Recently, these members of the secret society, who do not respect the law, took advantage of the vacancy left by the death of former County Magistrate Jiao and before the arrival of the new County Magistrate Wang Guanxian, to deceive the county government in an attempt to deny their actions. The town chief reported to the county government and the county party headquarters, requesting them to send a commission to inspect and confirm the tragic state of each section after being ransacked and destroyed and to take photographs and submit them to the higher authorities for review. It is said that the province, considering the seriousness of the case, urgently ordered the new county magistrate to thoroughly investigate the case and severely punish the perpetrators according to the law.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>

Captain Wu of the Baiguan Security Team, who was promoted to the province on official business, also passed through Shaoxing from Hangzhou at 9:00 AM on the same morning and rushed back to Baiguan to welcome him. County Magistrate Tang, Police Chief Gao, and others also took a special car to Caoe. As of the afternoon, there was no news of their arrival in Shaoxing.</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from the Pinghu County Government</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I read the item "Section Chief Jumps Over Wall and Gets Injured" in the Pinghu News of the Local Communications section on the 23rd of this month, which is completely untrue. All the section chiefs of this government have been working in the government office in recent days, and no one has gone to the hospital for treatment. Only one employee surnamed Jiang was sent to the South Gate Hospital for treatment on the 13th due to a common cold. On the 15th, the illness worsened, and his colleague, Mr. Xuan, and others went to visit him at 8:00 PM. They saw Mr. Jiang lying down in the hospital courtyard. The hospital said that he had fallen from the building, but there were no visible injuries on his body. Soon, Mr. Jiang Zheng's breathing became short and he died at around 11:00 PM. The fire in the Shen family's house in Hentang Lane occurred after 4:00 AM on the morning of the 16th. At that time, Mr. Jiang had already passed away in the hospital, which is completely unrelated to this matter. As for receiving threatening letters, it is even more unfounded. I am afraid that someone deliberately spread rumors in order to confuse people's hearts. I hope you will correct it immediately.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Pinghu County Government</p>

<h3>Order from the Ministry of Education: Student Uniforms Should Use Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education believes that student uniforms should be changed to use domestic goods. It has issued a special order to the Education Departments of various provinces and the Education Bureaus of special municipalities, stating: "The Central Executive Committee's Audit Office has sent an official letter stating, 'Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Reorganization Committee has submitted a report (Committee Letter No. 4009) requesting that the National Schools be ordered to use domestic goods for student uniforms in the future in order to promote them.' It was approved by the Standing Committee and handed over to the Ministry of Education for review. A copy of the original report is attached. After investigation, it is clear that the materials for student uniforms in national schools must be completely domestic goods, as clearly stipulated in Article 7 of the Regulations on Student Uniforms issued by the Ministry. Now, according to the previous reason, the previous order should be reiterated to promote this. In addition to replying to the letter, the original attachment is hereby copied and sent for compliance. The affiliated organizations are also instructed to comply and report the handling situation for verification. This order."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Issues Order to Change School Holidays</h3>
<p>Implementing in the 19th Year... Abolishing the Lunar New Year Winter Vacation</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, in order to abolish the Lunar New Year winter vacation, revise the school year and semester system, and the regulations on holiday dates, has issued an order to the education departments of each province, universities, and special municipality education bureaus, stating:</p>
<p>Regarding the previous approval by this Ministry of the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee's Document No. 1647, recently received from the Standing Committee the presentation from the Hebei Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee, which forwarded a request from the Changping County Steering Committee to order all schools nationwide to abolish the Lunar New Year winter vacation and implement the National Calendar New Year holiday, which was approved "to be forwarded to the Ministry of Education." A copy of the original presentation is enclosed for your review, and an additional copy is submitted to this Ministry. Considering that our country is vast, with varying climates, the southern regions are close to the tropics, naturally free from severe winter cold, while in the northern regions, the cold season begins in late autumn and continues until early summer. Even in the central regions, due to differences in latitude, mountains, seas, and plains, the start and end of the cold season vary from place to place. Even if schools must take a break due to severe cold, there is no reason for them to all be during the Lunar December and January. Therefore, the so-called winter vacation is actually using the name of "winter vacation" to preserve the custom of celebrating the Lunar New Year. At a time when the National Government is clearly ordering the implementation of the National Calendar, it is inappropriate to allow this practice to continue. This is the first reason why it should be abolished immediately. The name "winter vacation" is a false pretext, and its dates often shift with the Lunar New Year festivals. As a result, the length of the first and second semesters in each school year varies, and the corresponding semesters in different school years also differ in the number of days. Due to this, the curriculum of the first and second semesters in each school year cannot be evenly distributed, and the number of teaching days and the amount of content in the corresponding semesters of each school year cannot be made equal. This harms school education deeply. To remedy these issues, it is even more inappropriate to allow this practice to continue. This is the second reason why it should be abolished immediately. Furthermore, the ban on recording the Lunar Calendar in almanacs has been repeatedly ordered by the National Government for compliance. From now on, there will be no reliable basis for checking Lunar New Year festivals. Even if private individuals secretly use the old methods, making reckless calculations and spreading them in violation of the ban, their errors will be obvious. These Lunar New Year festivals are already baseless, and the winter vacation associated with them cannot be preserved. This is the third reason why it should be abolished immediately. This Ministry, in accordance with the National Government's repeated orders to implement the National Calendar and prohibit the use of the Lunar Calendar, and also adopting the intention of the original presentation from the Hebei Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee, has decided to abolish the winter vacation, which has been a major obstacle to school education for more than ten years. Starting from the 11th year of the Republic (1922), all schools nationwide must not have winter vacations. However, considering that the beginning of reform should embody both the transformation of customs and the retention of habitual practices, the National Calendar New Year holiday will be extended to three weeks, allowing the general public to transfer all kinds of customs associated with the Lunar New Year's end and beginning, such as sacrifices, celebrations, banquets, entertainment, and rest, to this New Year holiday period. Teachers, staff and students of all levels of schools should be models and advocates to promote the National Calendar. In addition to replying to the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee and requesting them to review and forward this matter, the Regulations on the School Year, Semester, and Holiday Dates have been revised and submitted to the Executive Yuan for review, and then submitted to the National Government for approval and record. Subsequently, Instruction No. 741 from the Executive Yuan was received, stating that the submission and attachments had been reviewed. The Ministry's proposal to abolish the winter vacation related to the Lunar New Year festivals in all schools nationwide starting from the 19th year (1930), and to extend the New Year holiday period, is in line with the purpose of promoting the National Calendar and should be approved. The revised Regulations on the School Year, Semester, and Holiday Dates should be promulgated by ministerial order for implementation, and then reported to the National Government for review and record. Furthermore, Instruction No. 983 from the Executive Yuan was received, stating that the previous submission from the Ministry regarding the abolishment of the winter vacation, extension of the New Year holiday, and revision of the Regulations on the School Year, Semester, and Holiday Dates, which was submitted to the Yuan for review, has been forwarded for review and instructions have been issued. Now, Instruction No. 467 from the National Government has been received, stating, "All submissions have been reviewed and approved for record. The documents are stored," etc. Therefore, it is hereby ordered for your information. Accordingly, this Ministry will immediately promulgate the revised Regulations on the School Year, Semester, and Holiday Dates, and it will take effect from August 1, 1930. From the 19th school year onwards, all schools nationwide should comply with these regulations and must not have winter vacations. The school calendar for the 19th school year for schools at all levels should be compiled separately by the respective "Departments," "Schools," and "Bureaus" according to the provisions of Article 10, Paragraph 1 of these regulations by May 31 of this year, and reported directly or forwarded to this Ministry for approval. In addition to promulgation and separate orders, a copy of the revised Regulations on School Year, Semester, and Holiday Dates is hereby issued for the "Departments," "Schools," and "Bureaus" to comply with and instruct their subordinates to comply with. This order,</p>

<h3>The Municipal Education Bureau Formulates Measures for the Tutor System</h3>
<p>Order for Implementation in Municipal Middle Schools</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, recognizing that the implementation of a tutor system in schools allows teachers to fulfill their guidance responsibilities outside of class and students to learn the principles of self-cultivation and social interaction in addition to their studies, is highly effective in fostering and developing students' individuality. Therefore, it has formulated sixteen articles for implementation and issued them to all municipal secondary schools yesterday for compliance. The main points of the Measures for Implementing the Tutor System in Municipal Secondary Schools are excerpted as follows: (1) The purpose of the tutor system is to enable teachers and students to live together, understand students' individualities, develop the virtues of the five educations, cultivate the virtues of dealing with people, and provide guidance on all aspects of life.

Senior high school students in the second and third grades may choose their tutors freely. (5) For the free selection of tutors, students shall fill out a tutor selection form with the tutor of their first choice to a certain number of choices. Each choice should list one tutor. Tutors shall be assigned according to the order in which the forms are submitted. If the first choice tutor is already full, the student should choose their second choice, and so on. (6) Once a tutor has been designated or selected, they may not be changed mid-term, except in special circumstances and with the approval of the moral education meeting. (7) Those who hold outside positions or teach more than six hours per week shall not be eligible to serve as tutors. (8) All tutors must reside at the school. (9) If there are insufficient tutors, the system shall be implemented in the highest or lowest classes of junior and senior high school as much as possible. (10) The designation or selection of tutors shall be held once per semester, and the allocation of tutors shall be completed by the third week of the semester. (11) Tutors shall hold a group meeting with all their students at least once per week, and individual meetings may be held at any time. (12) All tutors in each school shall meet once a month to discuss matters that should be promoted or reformed, and submit them to the moral education meeting for approval and implementation. (13) Once a tutor has been selected or designated, they may not resign on frivolous grounds. In case of unavoidable circumstances, the matter must be submitted to the school affairs meeting for decision. (14) Tutors shall submit a monthly report on their work to the principal. (15) Each school shall report on the implementation of the tutor system to the bureau once per semester.

<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Dispatches Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate the Complaint Against Jiannan Middle School</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau dispatched personnel to thoroughly investigate the complaint against Jiannan Middle School. According to the report, "Regarding the report, we were ordered to thoroughly investigate the case of Jiannan Middle School being accused of being a communist training organization. We complied and went to the school located at 33 Maigen Road at 1 PM on the 24th of this month to investigate. Because the school was located in a remote area, we had to ask around several times before we finally saw the so-called Jiannan Middle School. There was no school sign at the intersection, only a sign that read 'Jiannan Middle School First Institute' hanging at the entrance. We entered and asked to see the principal, but were told that he was not at the school. We then inspected the school building, which was a four-story residential house. There were three rooms on one side of the ground floor, and a staircase on the other side. The doors of the rooms were open, and there were two people who looked like students reading newspapers. We asked them if the principal was at the school, and they pointed to an inner room. We saw a man in a suit and glasses pacing back and forth. We asked him his name, and he said that he was the principal, Fang Jirui. We then talked about the school's past and present situation. He made the following remarks: 'I was entrusted by important figures of the Party and the country to found this school. The school board members are He Jian, Lu Dipin, Lin Zhiyu, Zhu Hegeng, Zhuang Xiquan, Cao Wanshun, Yi Shunyu, Zhang Ji and others. The Director of Studies is Ms. Zheng Yongtao, a Sichuan native. The other faculty and staff have not yet been finalized. Our school just opened this month. The school is divided into two parts. This place is for classrooms, offices, female dormitories, and the female cafeteria. The other part is at 36 Wuding Road, which serves as the male dormitory and the senior high school second grade classroom. There are more than one hundred students in total, with females accounting for more than ten. Our school has already submitted an application for registration in accordance with the Shanghai Private School Regulations, and my friends are familiar with Director Chen of the Municipal Education Bureau, so this matter should not be a problem.' After the conversation, we inspected the school building. The ground floor office was decorated with desks and filing cabinets. The female cafeteria had two square tables and several long benches. One room on the second floor was supposed to be a library, but it was currently empty. It was said that the school was just founded and was waiting for donations. There were two classrooms with desks and chairs made of unfinished wood. Each room had about eleven or twelve sets. There were words 'Pujiang Middle School' written on the drawers with white chalk. We do not know whether they were purchased from that school or were reorganized. There were also two classrooms on the third floor, all very simply furnished. While we were visiting, a female student was playing the organ, and two other female students came down from upstairs. There was a piece of paper pasted on the wall, which read 'Female Dormitory', so we did not go upstairs to visit. We then left the school and went to the school's dormitory on Wuding Road. The building had four floors, which were single rooms. One room on the second floor was a classroom, and the rest were used as bedrooms. Regarding the accused counter-revolutionary organization, we were unable to search the students' rooms for fear of misunderstanding, and the location in the concession made it even more difficult. The principal said that there were more than one hundred students, but we only saw seven or eight. We only saw the principal and the director of studies. We arrived at the school at about 2:15 PM, but there was not a single person in the classroom, which was quite strange. It is now the end of March and the school just opened. According to the explicit order of the Ministry of Education on February 1, the school must first apply for establishment before it can enroll students. The school has not complied with the law, which is not in compliance with regulations. According to the school's prospectus, the academic system is divided into arts and sciences. The arts subjects can be used as a facade, but the science subjects have no equipment at all. Furthermore, the school is enrolling transfer students for the first and second grades of senior high school and all grades of junior high school. If junior high school students study for three months, they can obtain a junior high school diploma. Newly opened schools enrolling transfer students like this are suspicious of being insubstantial. Chen Wenbin's letter accused the school of training party members and organizing demonstrations and factory strikes. It was difficult to find out by asking the school authorities and students. We fear that they would not dare to reveal the truth for fear of being caught by the law. It seems that the municipal party headquarters should conduct a secret investigation to clarify the matter. We hereby report the facts truthfully to you for your consideration. Respectfully submitted to Director Chen."</p>

<h3>Guangdong Basketball Team to Play against McLains Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Guangdong basketball team, which will attend the National Games, has excellent strength. Since the team will be leaving Shanghai in a few days, they have arranged to play against the McLains team tomorrow afternoon at the Chinese basketball court to get some practice.</p>
<h3>The Commercial Press Welcomes Athletes from Various Provinces</h3>
<p>Today at 4:30 PM at the Chinese Basketball Court</p>
<p>The date of the National Games is approaching, and athletes from various provinces are gathering in Shanghai to prepare everything before heading to Hangzhou. Recently, athletes from Guangdong, Hong Kong, Liaoning, Dalian, Qingdao, Harbin, Beijing-Tianjin, Fujian, Xiamen, Wuchang, Anqing, and other provinces have arrived in Shanghai. The Commercial Press, which publishes sports books and sells sports equipment, has always been very enthusiastic. It is reported that tomorrow afternoon at 4:30 PM, to facilitate the athletes' practice, it will hold a welcoming reception with fine refreshments (provided by the Great China Company on Sichuan Road) at the basketball court next to the National Sports Advancement Association on Labor Father Road. Mr. Hao Boyang, the executive director of the association, will give a brief speech to express his admiration. After the reception, a group photo will be taken at the track and field venue, and commemorative notebooks, handbooks, and West Lake tourist guides will be distributed.</p>
<h3>Far Eastern Games Women's Volleyball to Use Nine Players</h3>
<p>Dr. An Qingyi from the Japanese Sports Association telegraphed the Chinese National Sports Advancement Association yesterday, stating that the rules for women's volleyball at the 9th Far Eastern Games will be changed to nine players, with the court being 18 meters long and 9 meters wide. He is seeking the agreement of China and the Philippines on these rules.</p>
<h3>Central China Athletes</h3>
<p>Expected to Arrive Today</p>
<p>More than 80 athletes from Central China (Anhui, Shandong, Hunan, and Hubei) who will participate in the National Games have taken the Jiang'an ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Shanghai. According to the telegram received yesterday, they are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today. The travel agency's North Station reception desk will arrange their lodging. They will stay in Shanghai for one day before heading to Hangzhou.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Delegation</h3>
<p>(1) Departing from the North Station on the 30th Morning</p>
<p>The members of our city's delegation are scheduled to report to the temporary reception area at the North Railway Station before 8:30 AM on the 30th morning. They will then take the Shanghai-Hangzhou express train departing at 9:10 AM to Hangzhou. Yesterday's report incorrectly stated that the meeting place was at the South Railway Station.</p>
<p>Guangdong Athletes Delegation's Men's and Women's Basketball Instructor</p>
<p>Mr. Wei Zesheng</p>
<p>(2) Men's and Women's Tennis Practice Today</p>
<p>This afternoon at 4:30 PM, the men's and women's singles and doubles tennis players will practice at the Chinese Tennis Court. Yu Tianguang and Zheng Zhaojia may practice on campus and do not need to attend.</p>
<p>(3) Zhang Jianye Disqualified</p>
<p>Zhang Jianye, a famous track and field athlete in our city, has recently been confirmed by the City Games to have violated amateur sports rules. His right to represent the city at the National Games has been revoked. The director of the technical division has informed Mr. Zhang via letter that he need not go to Hangzhou. It is a great pity that Zhang, who had great prospects in the National Games, has been disqualified. However, for the sake of respecting amateur sports rules, Shanghai had to reluctantly make this decision. It is said that a total of five people have been disqualified in this citywide sports meet, one after another.</p>
<p>(4) Volleyball Team Practice Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai volleyball team, which will attend the National Games, is scheduled to practice at Fudan University in Jiangwan this afternoon at 3:00 PM. The following players are expected to attend on time: Weng Zulie, Chen Baoqiu, Chen Fuyu, Cheng Mingjue, Zhang Guoxuan, Xie Baochang, Cao Tingzan, Wu Changfa, Li Xinbiao, Wen Tianpeng, Zhao Binglin, and Li Fujun.</p>
<p>(5) City Education Bureau Sent Letters to Schools Yesterday</p>
<p>Student Athletes Granted Leave</p>
<p>The Shanghai Education Bureau, in order to allow all city athletes to attend the National Games without worries, sent letters to various schools yesterday, stating, "To whom it may concern, the athletes selected by our bureau's City Games will participate in the National Games. It has been decided that they will take a train to Hangzhou on the 30th of this month and return to Shanghai on April 12th. During this time, all student athletes participating are to be granted 14 days of leave. Please do not deduct points during their leave so that they can attend without worries and show their skills for the city. We sincerely hope you will comply accordingly."</p>
<h3>Actions of Athletes Remaining in Shanghai from Various Cities</h3>
<p>(1) Guangdong Women's Volleyball Team Training</p>
<p>The entire team of over a hundred people will leave Shanghai for Hangzhou on the 29th. They have been practicing diligently at the Observatory Road sports ground recently, especially the men's volleyball and women's basketball teams. Guangdong women's basketball has traditionally used men's rules. Recently, because the National Games adopted a two-zone system for women's rules, it has been quite disadvantageous to the Guangdong team. They have been training in women's techniques recently, under the guidance of Mr. Wei Zesheng. The team has average talent and is very lively. They are especially confident in their shooting skills. As for the men's volleyball team, they are not only vying for the Far Eastern representation but also harbor a sense of revenge. Last year, the Guangdong Zhongshan University volleyball team came to Shanghai and was defeated by Fudan University. This time, most of the Guangdong representatives are Zhongshan University players, while most of the Shanghai representatives are Fudan players. They are bound to have a fierce battle at the National Games. Observing the strength of the Guangdong team, they are very solid, and their tactics are quite ingenious. The person on the left side of the first row is especially fierce. In short, the team has uncanny passing skills and unpredictable spiking skills. Their saving skills are also very steady. It is hoped that the Shanghai team will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>(2) Liaoning Not Going to Hangzhou Today</p>
<p>The entire team is still staying at the Zhenhua Hotel. They will not leave Shanghai today. Among them, the women's volleyball team is quite strong. The men's and women's track and field teams go without saying. They have been going to the Observatory Road (i.e., Route Pére Robert) sports ground for practice every day recently. The men's group has about twenty people, and their methods are purely German. This is because the team's instructor is the German, Mr. Bochen. They do not rotate when throwing the discus. This method is fine for tall people, but it may not be suitable for short people. In running, they alternate between using their heels and toes. For example, in the 100-meter race, they use their heels for 50 meters and their toes for 50 meters. This method seems to have some rationale.</p>
<p>(4) Tianjin Basketball Team Watching a Game Today</p>
<p>The Second Batch of Athletes Arriving in Shanghai Today</p>
<p>The second batch of athletes, track and field, soccer, baseball, etc., have already gone to Hangzhou. The basketball team is currently staying at Jiaotong University. Because the basketball stadium at the National Games in Hangzhou has not yet been completed, and there may be no opportunity for practice, they are still staying in Shanghai to practice. At 8:00 PM this afternoon, they will go to the Chinese Basketball Hall to watch the Shanghai team's basketball match against Pilabao. Also, the team's instructor, Mr. Dong Shouyi, and the director, Mr. Zhang Jiwu, have not yet arrived in Shanghai. It is expected that Mr. Dong and Mr. Zhang, along with the women's athletes delegation, will arrive in Shanghai this afternoon.</p>
<p>(5) Qingdao Athletes Going to Hangzhou Today</p>
<p>The Qingdao athletes were originally scheduled to leave Shanghai for Hangzhou yesterday afternoon. Because they have been busy preparing supplies in recent days, they have not yet departed. It is said that they will go to Hangzhou this morning.</p>

<p>After Tianjin Municipality held its citywide games, it produced 104 athletes. The organizing committee was previously notified via telegram. Now it is learned that the city's first team of athletes arrived yesterday (the 24th) afternoon at 2:00 PM. The team consists of 39 male athletes and 2 female athletes, led by coach and staff member Hou Luoxun. The organizing committee's reception area will receive them and take them to the prepared dormitories to rest.</p>
<p>(3) Shanghai and Hangzhou Reception Areas Established</p>
<p>The Shanghai and Hangzhou reception areas have been established under the leadership of Jiang Jiasheng, head of the free reception group. The Shanghai North Station reception area, prepared by Chen Huiyi, was established on the 24th of this month. The address is attached to the China Travel Service inside the North Station. The Hangzhou City Station reception area was also prepared and established by Yang Peisun on the 23rd of this month.</p>
<p>(4) Arrangement of Athletes' Dormitories</p>
<p>The National Games organizing committee has completed the arrangement of dormitories, bathrooms, and various facilities for the male and female athletes attending the Games. The rooms and beds are all numbered and are divided into the first, second, and third large dormitories. Each dormitory can accommodate more than 500 people. The first dormitory is the location of the women's athletes' dormitory, and the first bathroom is the women's bathroom, which is attached to the first dormitory. It is said that the arrangement and facilities are quite comprehensive. In the future, the athletes should not have any inconvenience in their daily lives.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Women's Basketball Team</h3>
<p>Players Have Not Yet Practiced</p>
<p>Suzhou News: For this National Games, the Jiangsu women's basketball team athletes were to be represented by Sun Shuquan and seven others from Suzhou Girls' Middle School, Mao Yuwen from Nanjing Girls' Middle School, and Wang Huizhen from Xuzhou Girls' Middle School. Now, as the date approaches, Zhang Yingfen, the forward from Suzhou Girls' Middle School, suddenly fell ill, and the representatives from Nanjing and Xuzhou have not yet arrived in Suzhou for practice. Therefore, whether they will attend has become a question. The women's basketball team leader, Ms. Lin Yunsheng, dispatched someone to the provincial capital yesterday to request instructions.</p>
<h3>A Scene from the Jiangnan University Basketball Game</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 22nd), the two Jiangnan University basketball teams, Groups A and B, went to Zhizhi University on Jiangwan Road to compete with the university's basketball team for the Jiangnan University basketball championship. The Group B teams from the two schools started the game at 2:30 PM. In the beginning, the strengths of the two sides were relatively equal. Falling behind, Jiangnan University gradually could not support Zhizhi University's defense, with Wei Kongguangyi coming and going to resist. Jiangnan University Group B could not fight back. In the first half, Zhizhi University Group B took the lead with a score of 33 to 10. The final result was that Zhizhi University Group B won with a score of 60 to 20. The referee was Shao Ji. At 3:30 PM, the Group A teams from the two schools began contact. Zhizhi University relied on the psychology of a larger number of people, all thinking that Jiangnan University was no match for them. Unexpectedly, after 40 minutes of struggle, Jiangnan University Group A won with a score of 49 to 43. The first half was 24 to 19, with Jiangnan University in the lead. The referee was still Shao Ji.</p>

<h3>City Propaganda Department Preparing for Huanghuagang Commemoration</h3>
<p>Announcing Commemoration Measures</p>
<p>The 29th of this month is the memorial day for the tragic and painful martyrdom of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang. Tracing back its historical outline, it was two years before the founding of the Republic of China. After the ninth failure of our party in Guangzhou, Huang Keqiang, Zhao Sheng, and others gathered the elite revolutionary parties from various provinces in Guangzhou. One year before the founding of the Republic of China (i.e., 1911 in the Western calendar during the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty), on March 29th, they launched another uprising, attacking and burning the Governor's Office. Those who died in battle and were killed totaled 72 people, all buried collectively at Huanghuagang, hence the name "72 Martyrs of Huanghuagang." It was also decided that this day would be the memorial day for this tragic incident. The city's propaganda department has formulated measures and is actively preparing for a grand memorial ceremony to express condolences and honor the loyal martyrs. It is said that on the morning of that day, representatives from various agencies, groups, and party departments at all levels will be convened at the Tai Li Hall of the City Party Headquarters on LinYin Road in the South City. Four representatives from each will participate to jointly hold a memorial service. The City Executive Committee will also notify all sectors to uniformly comply with the following five commemorative measures: (1) Holiday for one day, (2) Half-mast for one day, (3) Citywide silence for five minutes at noon (signaled by naval gun salutes), (4) Suspension of entertainment banquets for one day, (5) All civil servants and party members in the city to wear black armbands for one day (to be prepared by themselves).

<h3>Hai Rong Battleship Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Chiang Still in Fenghua</p>
<p>The Hai Rong warship that Commander-in-Chief Chiang took to his hometown to sweep the tombs returned to Songkou early yesterday morning to add coal. The Jiankang warship that accompanied him is still in Ningbo's Li Port. As of noon yesterday, Chiang had not yet left Fenghua. Chen Shaokuan, the Vice Minister of Naval Affairs, is also said to be with Chiang in Fenghua.</p>
<h3>Heavy Fog Outside Wusong Blocks Ships</h3>
<p>The Fengtian Maru Arrived Late The Dalian Steamship Company's Fengtian Maru ship, this time coming from Dalian via Qingdao to Shanghai, was originally scheduled to enter the port yesterday. Some of the Northeast athletes participating in the Zhejiang National Games were on board the ship to Shanghai, transferring to Hangzhou. However, the ship suddenly encountered heavy fog on the night of the 24th when it sailed to Sanjiaoshui, and the ship's route was obscured by the fog and could not be distinguished. In order to ensure safe navigation, the captain ordered the ship to anchor at sea and wait for the fog to dissipate before continuing. As a result, it did not arrive in Shanghai yesterday and will have to arrive this morning. The passengers were stranded on the ship for a day before arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<p>American Mail Ship Delayed The American Mail Steamship Company's Pacific mail ship, the Jefferson, coming from the United States to Shanghai, was scheduled to enter the port yesterday morning as usual. When it reached the outside of Wusong, about fifty nautical miles away, the route was obscured by fog. Fearing danger, the captain anchored there, intending to enter the port after the fog cleared. By yesterday afternoon, the ship was also constrained by the receding tide and could not move, so it could not sail in. It sent a radio message to Shanghai, saying that it would wait for the tide to rise before it could leave the shallows and sail to Shanghai, which is expected to be today. The ships leaving Shanghai that were blocked by fog outside Wusong were only able to go to sea one after another at noon yesterday.</p>
<p>Timber Ship Sunk The commercial ship Beringham, which was transporting timber from North America to the Far East, was loaded with a full ship of timber and sailed to China and Little Luzon to unload. When it reached the Fangzhou Strait outside Yokohama, Japan, it encountered wind and fog, and the stern of the ship struck a reef. The rear hold was ruptured, the rudder machine and leaves fell off, and seawater entered the hold, causing the ship to sink. It is said that the crew and sailors have already been rescued to Japan by a rescue ship sent from Yokohama, while the ship and cargo were completely lost.</p>
<h3>Shipping News</h3>
<p>Sharp Decrease in Northern Cargo The situation in the North is gradually becoming tense. The Tianjin shipping group has sent a telegram to Shanghai, ordering a reduction in cargo handling from today. Shanghai originally had a large amount of miscellaneous grain to be shipped to Tianjin, but shipments have been suspended recently. Even the goods ordered by foreign merchants that are transferred from Shanghai to Tianjin have been instructed by telegram to be stored in Shanghai from this week. In the past two days, the export cargo of each ship going to Tianjin has only been 20-30%. However, passenger traffic has increased because the Jinpu Railway is blocked, and many people have changed to sea routes. All ships coming and going are crowded with passengers, and ticket prices on all ships have also increased.</p>
<p>Inspection of Incoming and Outgoing Passengers The Shanghai Customs was ordered to inspect passengers on incoming and outgoing commercial ships. The original order required ships entering and leaving the port to anchor at the mouth of Wusong to wait for customs officials to board the ship for inspection. After the Shanghai shipping companies requested that this be waived, because the Wusong tide is high and the water is rapid, anchoring and waiting for inspection often causes ships to collide with each other or be washed aground by the tide, which is dangerous. The Customs did not agree. It is now reported that the matter has been discussed and a result has been reached: the commercial ships are now ordered to anchor in the Wusong Yuncao Port and wait for customs officials to inspect them. This is convenient for both the public and private sectors and there is no danger of accidents. The inspection will be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>Kuae Lee Returns to Shanghai for Repairs The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Kuae Lee ship was attacked by bandits with cannons and gunfire in Majiazhai on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Fortunately, the crew was not injured, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. The ship has now telegraphed that it will return to Shanghai from Shashi to specially install steel plates to protect the drivers and passengers from bullets. The bandits in various places on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are elusive, and it is very dangerous to travel by ship. It is difficult to travel without installing steel plates.</p>
<h3>Shigemitsu Aoi's Mission to Beijing Last Night</h3>
<p>Exchanging Notifications on the Reorganization of the Provisional Court</p>
<p>Japan Has Unconditionally Recognized the Reorganization</p>
<p>Japanese Acting Minister Shigemitsu Aoi went to Beijing last week. Because Ambassador Adachi came to Shanghai, he hurriedly returned to Shanghai, staying in Beijing for only one day and unable to fully negotiate various matters. Yesterday (the 25th), he went to Beijing at 11:00 PM, accompanied by Secretary Lin Chu, at the invitation of Foreign Minister Wang. He will stay in Beijing for three days and is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the night train on the 29th. As for the mission to Beijing this time, in addition to handling routine diplomatic affairs, he will also exchange notifications with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the reorganization of the Shanghai Provisional Court. Japan has unconditionally recognized the reorganization of the Provisional Court. In order to comply with diplomatic practice, he specially went to Beijing to exchange notifications. The reorganization of the Provisional Court was decided by a conference of six countries convened by the National Government. Japan, as a non-treaty country, did not participate. Now, because the effective date is approaching on April 1, Japan is inconvenient to act differently. Also, because the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement has been drafted, the positions of China and Japan are different from before. After several informal consultations between Foreign Minister Wang and Acting Minister Shigemitsu Aoi, a final solution was reached. Japan then automatically and unconditionally recognized the reorganization of the Provisional Court.</p>
<h3>National Goods Factories Meeting Today to Go to Hangzhou for Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factories Federation sent a circular yesterday, stating, "To whom it may concern, we have just received a letter from Mr. Fang Jiange, stating that Jiange went to Hangzhou on business the other day and met Mr. Ruan Jihou, who said that the Hangzhou Municipal Committee for Promoting National Goods plans to hold the first National Goods Mobile Exhibition for two weeks, and to set up a temporary National Goods Mobile Market at the New Market YMCA, opening on April 1. The committee appointed Mr. Ruan as the representative to Shanghai to solicit products. Because the time is urgent and there is a lack of manpower for preparation, he entrusted Jiange to return to Shanghai to discuss everything. We hereby send this letter urgently, please convene representatives of various manufacturers immediately to discuss the methods. We hope very much, and attach the various articles of the methods, etc. The opening of the National Games in Hangzhou is on April 1, and it is also the third spring season, with pilgrims gathering, and business will be prosperous.

(10) Please inform us of the date of arrival in Hangzhou so that we can welcome you.</p>

<h3>Danish Crown Prince Arrived in Qingdao Before Returning Home</h3>
<p>The Third Prince and Princess Went to Ping for Sightseeing</p>

<h3>British Authorities Crack Down on Private Postal Agencies' Bulk Mail</h3>
<p>Ministry of Communications Cables Instruct Explanation of Misunderstanding</p>
<p>Shantou and Xiamen Commissioners Handle Matter with Utmost Care</p>
<p>The news of the British authorities in Kuala Lumpur planning to crack down on private postal agencies' bulk mail within a specified time limit has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now reported that the Chinese Postal Service, after receiving the letter from Kuala Lumpur Post Office, limiting the implementation of the crackdown after March 31, and enclosing notices from the governments of various islands in the South Seas and the Federated Malay States, immediately reported it to the Ministry of Communications, ordering them to explain it to overseas Chinese groups in Shanghai and other places to avoid misunderstandings, and to instruct the commissioners sent to Shantou and Xiamen to handle the matter quickly and carefully. As the time limit for the British postal service's crackdown is imminent, and a solution is urgently needed, the General Bureau has appointed commissioners Zhou Huodong and Lin Zhuowu to go to the Chinese Overseas Chinese Federation, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, and other organizations to explain the situation and ask for their support, and has scheduled to go to Shantou and Xiamen tomorrow to contact and handle matters with the relevant parties, so as to take into account both the International Postal Union Convention and the convenience of overseas Chinese communications, and to handle the matter carefully. Attached is the Ministry's cable: "Shanghai Postal Service General Bureau Office, all telegrams and submissions from the view of Ge Dai and Zhong are known. Regarding the case of cracking down on private postal agencies' bulk mail, since a reply from the British Kuala Lumpur Post Office has been received proving that it was not proposed by our country, please explain it clearly to the overseas Chinese groups in Shanghai and other places to avoid misunderstandings, and instruct the commissioners sent to Shantou and Xiamen to handle the matter quickly and carefully. In addition to reporting the actual situation to the government and notifying the relevant agencies, and replying to the various organizations in Singapore by telegram, the cable is followed, Ministry of Communications Ma Yin."</p>
<h3>Singapore Cracks Down on Private Postal Agencies</h3>
<p>Postal General Bureau Mistakenly Believes Kuala Lumpur</p>
<p>Yesterday, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce sent a telegram to the National Government, stating: "To the Nanjing National Government Junjian, regarding the case of the Ministry of Communications Postal General Bureau initiating the cancellation of overseas Chinese mail bulk mail, the subordinate association has telegraphed to your government to order the Ministry to cancel it. On March 22 of this year, a letter from the Secretariat of the Civil Service of your government on March 19 was received, approving the Ministry of Communications' reply, stating that the Postal General Bureau's presentation stated that the reports were untrue, and that the Kuala Lumpur Postal General Bureau had been telegraphed, and a reply was received stating that the bureau did not say to the representatives when the Chinese representatives petitioned the Governor of Singapore, etc., that the Postal General Bureau of China initiated the crackdown, etc., and that the Ministry of Communications copied the two letters to the association for reference, etc. After checking the Shanghai Shen Bao reported on February 26, the words 'China initiated the crackdown' were what the Singapore Governor's Chinese Civil Affairs Secretary and the Postal Governor said to the Chinese representatives Li Weinan, etc., and presented the Postal General Bureau's repeated letters as</p>
<p>General Bureau, the location and the organization do not match, resulting in the letter being irrelevant, and the general representative of the entire overseas Chinese convention petitioning for the retention of the private postal agencies in Singapore, Li Weinan, is the current chairman of the Singapore Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, and Lin Yishun is the former chairman of the Singapore Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. The two general representatives Li and Lin repeatedly telegraphed your government and the Ministry of Communications, all stating the details of this matter. If the Postal General Bureau of the Ministry of Communications did not initiate the crackdown, the Governor of Singapore, etc., would not dare to announce it, and there would be no repeated letters presented as evidence. If the Governor of Singapore, etc., did not say this, then the two general representatives Li and Lin would not dare to put it in official documents. This case is of great importance to increasing the suffering of the overseas Chinese compatriots. Therefore, we are sending another telegram to your government for verification, and we request that you approve the telegram to the Consul General in Singapore, the Singapore Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, and the Singapore General Branch of our Party to investigate and reply together to distinguish right from wrong and clarify responsibilities. We still earnestly request the retention of the private postal agency method to sympathize with the difficulties of the overseas Chinese. We cannot bear the urgent waiting for orders."</p>
<h3>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Establishes Bulletin Boards for Party, Government, and Military Agencies</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities previously established public advertising spaces in various locations, mostly leaving space at the bottom for merchants to post paper advertisements and for Party, government, and military agencies to post notices. Recently, as agency notices and merchant advertisements have been mixed together, it has not only been unsightly but has also reduced the effectiveness of both parties. Therefore, it has separately designated 25 bulletin boards for Party, government, and military agencies in the important locations of southern Shanghai and Zhabei, specifically for posting notices. The locations are as follows: (Southern Shanghai District) Xieqiao, Ximen, Nanyang Bridge, Minguo Road, Fangbang Road, Xianji Road, Bansongyuan Entrance, Gaochang Temple, Kangqu Road Corner of Zhizaoju Road, Lujiazui Linyin Road Intersection, Southern District Street, Xiaonanmen, Xinkaihe, Xiaoximen, Dongmen Road Intersection of Xiaodongmen, 16th Pu, Dongjiadu, Penglai Road, Zhaozhou Road Guohuo Road Limmalu Corner, (Zhabei District) Baoshan Road Railway Pavilion, Baoshan Road Chengzhi School Outside, Baoshan Road Baotong Road (South End Jingdeli Entrance), 481 Baoshan Road Outside Bamboo Fence, Southern End of Baoshan Road Oriental Library.</p>
<h3>Recent News on the Demand of Stall Vendors and Small Businessmen to Organize Associations</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan Approved the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to Verify</p>

Yesterday, the association, etc., received the Executive Yuan's approval No. 84, which stated that the matter is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and that the Ministry has been ordered to verify it and directly issue an order for information.</p>
<h3>The Wusong Chamber of Commerce Requests a Reduction in Ship Tax</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Reply to the Port Authority</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Special Municipality Finance Bureau and the Port Authority established a household registration office in Wusong to collect ship tax, the boatmen from Taizhou, Chongming, Haimen, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Shandong, and other places have opposed it and have requested the Wusong Chamber of Commerce to report the situation. The Municipal Finance Bureau sympathetically took into account the shipping merchants' concerns and agreed to reduce the tax burden appropriately. Subsequently, Zheng Shushan, chairman of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, attended a meeting convened by the Port Authority and explained in detail the difficulties of the various ship merchants, requesting a reduction in the tax. After discussion, it was decided that ships carrying sand, gravel, firewood, and charcoal would pay one yuan each time, regardless of size, and that the methods for other types of sailboats would be determined after investigation. Then it was decided to follow the plan. A few days ago, the Wusong Chamber of Commerce suddenly received a letter from the Port Authority stating that the situation described by Chairman Zheng of your Chamber was inconsistent with the findings of the Municipal Finance Bureau, and therefore it was not possible to implement the plan and the tax must still be paid according to the regulations. It is now learned that the Chamber of Commerce believes that the situation presented at the Port Authority meeting last time was entirely factual, and since it has been decided, it should naturally be implemented according to the plan and the previous decision cannot be overturned. Today, the Municipal Finance Bureau's investigation of the number of ships does not match. It is not known what the basis is. Furthermore, when various ships enter the port, the Shadiaochuan Tax Bureau collects ship tax, and they are also required to pay to the ship household registration office, which is equivalent to collecting the tax twice. The ship households' strength is unbearable. Therefore, reducing the tax rate according to the previous agreement, the ship households may be able to reluctantly accept it. If the Municipal Finance Bureau's current proposed method must be implemented for collection, then the ship households will find it difficult to bear, and it is feared that the reconciliation will not be successful and the shipping merchants will go to other ports, and the commerce of Songkou will decline completely. Therefore, the above situation was replied to the Port Authority yesterday (the letter is omitted), requesting that it be forwarded to the Municipal Finance Bureau, and that it consider the people's livelihood and sympathize with the hard-working shipping merchants, and continue to implement the method decided last time, so as to take into account both the treasury tax and the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Dr. Eddy Gave a Speech at the General Labor Union the Other Day</h3>
<p>Titled "The Situation of Laborers in the World"</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality General Labor Union Preparatory Committee invited Dr. Eddy of the United States to give a speech at 2:00 p.m. the other day (24th). A total of two hundred and several dozen representatives attended. The chairman was Lu Jingshi, the recorders were Yuan Zhaoxin and Shao Yida, and the master of ceremonies was Yu Yaoqiu. First, the chairman introduced Dr. Eddy, followed by Dr. Eddy's speech, titled "The Current Situation of Laborers in the World," which was translated by Huang Chuntao. The gist of his speech is as follows: Today, I and many labor leaders meet here, and the meeting place is full of a new atmosphere, which is very gratifying and the most hopeful thing. In twenty years, I have been to China seven times. I plan to travel around the world in thirty-five years. Now, I will talk about the four countries I have personally visited: the United States, Britain, Russia, and India. Finally, I will talk about the labor industry in China. The wages in the United States are the highest, and workers' insurance is also complete. Most of them pay attention to large-scale labor movements. Capitalists also have organized organizations, such as medical care and bathing, which the capitalists regard as charitable in nature. Workers at the Ford Motor Company used to earn five gold dollars a day, but now it has increased. There are two people in the British labor movement who are struggling: one is McDonald. Their organization is very powerful. It is not a tool for changing government but is really for the happiness of workers. Later, the Labor Party was organized, and the Labor Party had a Ministry of Finance, a Ministry of the Interior, and an Economic Custodial Department, which was very powerful. It also stipulates the wages of laborers, at least how much insurance, and all other workers have reached an extremely high level, which I admire very much. Later, I went to Russia. The Russian problem is very difficult to talk about, because their country is the only country in the world, so there are people who are optimistic and pessimistic about heaven and hell. What I want to talk about is all the places I have seen. Their leaders are the same as ordinary people. If there are people who have irregular behaviors such as prostitution and concubinage, they will immediately use the most severe methods to punish them, such as exile. Their country is the poorest, and the wages of laborers are the lowest. In the United States, each person earns five yuan a day, but they only earn one yuan. Once, I saw 300,000 workers in a large cement factory resting in the garden, very happy. The library and hygiene facilities inside are all available and free of charge. In the factory, important matters, as well as education newspapers, etc., will be closed immediately if they are considered incorrect, as well as movies that should or should not be promoted. Managing the government is especially their main task. As for those who are exiled, they cannot come back again. It is estimated that there are also tens of hundreds of thousands of people who have been exiled, which is what I do not approve of. When I went to India, I saw a strange person, Gandhi, who talked about universal love and asked to use sincere love to influence people. I was with him for three days. He was very poor and lived a very simple life. He did not have a salary of three yuan and seventy-five jiao. He only ate some porridge and milk and wore rough clothes every day, which he made himself. Five hundred thousand people listened to his speech. His peaceful methods won the trust of the masses. The Chinese people account for a quarter of the world. Generally speaking, India is more bitter than China. In fact, China is more bitter than India. I hope you will unite to seek the liberation of the whole. In short, it is easier for capitalists to do things. What can workers do? In Britain, I saw an industrialist whose heart was to enable workers to get decent wages, to be able to marry themselves, and to enable their children to get a decent education. In the factory, they work forty hours a week, and there is employment insurance, etc. Workers who are unemployed still have decent wages, and workers also have the right to speak in the management of the enterprise. In the five years of the European War, he earned millions of dividends and distributed them all to the workers. He went to the capital because his brother could seek knowledge, but workers could not do it, and one party could not have high knowledge, so it is necessary to improve the workers. I hope everyone will unite and work for the welfare of the workers, so that the labor movement is in a good condition. The labor movement is not a tool of politicians. Some people use workers to strike in order to achieve their own goals, which is suicide. The labor movement is entirely in the hands of the workers and should have intelligent and clever leaders, because the labor movement is the most sacred. It is wrong to be loyal to the country but not to the labor movement. I have been to China in the Qing Dynasty, during the Boxer Rebellion, and also during the Yuan Shikai era. The current phenomenon in China is better than before, but I hope you have the power to stop military action and pay special attention to the people's livelihood in the Three Principles of the People. For the whole world, we must also regard it as one body. This is your responsibility, and so on.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Cracking Down on Fraudulent Stock Prospectuses</h3>
<p>Promulgating Nine Provisional Measures</p>

<h3>County Public Security Bureau Rectifies Police Regulations</h3>
<p>Zhao Lian, the Chief Inspector of the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau, recently noted the lax discipline among the police officers in the bureau. Their uniforms and weapons were often unbuttoned and rusty, and many officers did not reside in the dormitories after their night shifts. Fearing that this would lead to corruption among the police force, he has issued the following order to all police officers in order to rectify the police regulations: It is hereby announced that the spirit of the police lies entirely in their neat and tidy appearance. If their uniforms are not in order, their spirit is completely extinguished. The police are the role models for the people, and should strive to be more diligent and eliminate bad habits in order to fulfill their duty. On the 20th of this month, at 8:40 PM, it was observed that only two officers were on duty at the main gate, one officer was missing, one was armed, and one was unarmed. All were wearing cotton overcoats, and the buttons on the armed officer's overcoat were mostly missing. Both inner and outer garments were unbuttoned, and the rifle was covered in rust. The ammunition belt was also not worn, and the officers stood with no spirit. Such a situation is equivalent to wooden puppets and is extremely unsightly. The post downstairs at the county government building was not seen, presumably having been removed long ago. Upon inspecting the patrol officers' dormitories, many were not in their rooms, and it is unknown where they were idling. How can they assemble in case of an emergency? As the Chief Inspector responsible for inspection and command, I must make a vigorous effort to rectify this situation and rejuvenate the force, thereby enhancing the reputation of our Public Security Department. It is hereby ordered that the patrol officers properly supervise and restrain the long-term officers in the bureau, and instruct all officers to clean and organize their uniforms and weapons by a specific date to improve their appearance. The patrol officers' etiquette must be practiced diligently, and no further signs of corruption should be seen. Furthermore, after investigating, it was found that five agencies are located within this compound, all sharing the same main gate for entry and exit. The security responsibility is extremely important. Not only must uniforms be neat and tidy, but all matters must also be handled with care to avoid negligence. Hereafter, those found with untidy uniforms, unbuttoned buttons, unauthorized absence from duty, or leaving without permission at night will be severely punished to enforce police regulations.</p>

<h3>Machine Factory: Young Master Abducted by Bandits</h3>
<p>Bandits Trick Apprentice into Opening Door</p>
<p>Robbery of Over One Hundred Silver Dollars</p>
<p>Three-Year-Old Son Abducted</p>
<p>Wang Shunjin, a native of Ningbo, 47 years old, runs the Tongshunxing Machine Factory at No. 515-6, Alley 2, Jingwei Road, Fair Road. His residence is next door to the factory. Last night, around 8:40 PM, the alley gate was closed and guarded by an apprentice named Rui Di. Suddenly, someone knocked on the door, calling out Rui Di's name. The apprentice immediately opened the gate and let the person in. It turned out to be a group of seven or eight burly men, some wearing long robes and others short jackets. They went straight into No. 535. Wang Shunjin's wife and children were chatting in the living room. Two bandits stood guard outside, while the others entered the room, pulled out pistols, and spoke in a Qingjiang accent, telling everyone in the room not to move. They then invaded the inner room, ransacked the chests and cabinets, and stole 106 silver dollars. However, the bandits' goal was not just money. As they left, they snatched Wang Shunjin's three-year-old second son, Xia Sheng, from the arms of the maid, and fled.</p>
<h3>Truth Behind the Double Suicide Case</h3>
<p>Unable to Marry Prostitute Due to Poverty</p>
<p>Left with No Other Option</p>
<p>Lu Fengzhi's Real Name is Huizhu</p>
<p>Deceased Left Behind Elderly Mother</p>
<p>Guo Jinhua, a native of Zhongshan, Guangdong, and a woman named Lu Fengzhi, also from Zhongshan, experienced difficulties in their love affair and were unable to achieve their desired union. They decided to commit suicide together. They checked into Room 447 of a hotel on Nanjing Road and consumed poison together, hoping to die together. The tea server discovered them, and Guo had already succumbed to the poison, with no hope of recovery. He died at the scene. Miss Lu was still salvageable and was taken to Guangren Hospital for treatment by the police. Guo's body was taken to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road to await official examination. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Guo Jinhua, the deceased, worked at a certain bank during his lifetime. His family was poor, and his monthly salary was barely enough to make ends meet. However, he suddenly lost his job at the end of the year before last and has been unemployed ever since. Guo had six brothers who often came to comfort him. Last spring, he and his friends frequented brothels. Because the madam, Lu Zhang, at the Guangdong prostitute house No. 209, Renzhi Lane, North Sichuan Road, treated Guo very well, Guo lingered at her house. The madam, nearly forty years old, had a husband who did not have a proper job, so she had no choice but to have her biological daughter, Huizhu, engage in prostitution to make a living. Huizhu, seventeen years old, was charming and amiable. Seeing that Guo was gentle and refined, she was willing to devote herself to him. The madam was also happy to have this potential son-in-law, so she allowed her daughter to be in love with Guo, unlike other madams who were only interested in profit. Huizhu removed her name from the list of prostitutes this year and waited exclusively for Guo to marry her. However, Guo was plagued by poverty and had not been able to make it a reality. As time went on, he became desperate, and Huizhu pressed him further. Guo then invited the woman to a hotel, where they confided in each other in a private room and he expressed his desire to commit suicide. The woman could not bear to abandon Guo and agreed to commit suicide with him. Thus, they took poison together. When they first arrived at the hotel, Guo used the alias Huang Zhihua, and the woman used the alias Lu Zhifen. After the incident, Guo's real name was discovered from a name card found on his person, and the woman's name, Huizhu, was also discovered by the police after she was sent to the hospital. Yesterday morning, Judge Gao Junxiang of the Provisional Court came to the scene to examine the body and took his seat in the public chamber. The hotel tea server, Lou Yongfa, described in detail the process of how the young couple entered the hotel and were discovered to have taken poison. Guo's mother, Guo Li, requested permission to claim the body for burial and stated that she still did not know why her son committed suicide. Huizhu's mother, Lu Zhang, was also summoned to court and testified that Guo frequented her establishment, developed a love affair with her daughter, and that his suicide was due to his inability to marry her. She said that Guo had attempted suicide three times before for this reason, but was discovered each time. Judge Gao then instructed Guo Li to arrange for the burial. Guo, who was willing to abandon his elderly mother and commit suicide for the sake of a prostitute, although his intentions were extremely foolish and not to be imitated, his situation is indeed very pitiful.</p>
<h3>Lawyer's Fee Issue in Property Dispute Case</h3>
<p>Xi Yafu vs. Ma Ma</p>
<p>Both Parties Agreed to a Contract at the Time of Engagement</p>
<p>30% of Proceeds to be Paid as Remuneration</p>
<p>Settlement Reached, Securing Assets of 10,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Lawyer's Fees Demanded, But Refused</p>
<p>The Jinlingchun Restaurant on Zhengjia Muqiao, is owned by the Ma family. There are five Ma brothers, the eldest of whom is deceased, leaving behind his wife, Mrs. Ma. Recently, Mrs. Ma was involved in a property dispute in the Provisional Court with her uncles-in-law, Ma Houji, Hounian, Houwu, and Houlu. The lawyer retained by Mrs. Ma was Xi Yafu. At the time of engagement, both parties entered into a contract stipulating that if the case was won, 30% of the recovered assets would be paid as legal fees. Subsequently, the case was settled out of court, and Mrs. Ma obtained 10,000 yuan. She notified Lawyer Xi and requested that the case be dismissed. Upon learning that the client had received 10,000 yuan, Lawyer Xi demanded 3,000 yuan in legal fees as per the contract. However, Mrs. Ma refused to pay and instead retained another lawyer, Lawyer Dan, who sent a letter to Lawyer Xi requesting that he not proceed further. Yesterday afternoon, the case was heard in the Eighth Tribunal. The judge, based on the requests of both parties, approved the withdrawal of the lawsuit. However, Lawyer Xi's legal fees remain unresolved. It is likely that further disputes will arise as Xi seeks to enforce the contract.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents Request That the Municipal Council Allocate Funds for Japanese Children's Schools</h3>
<p>The Wenhui Bao reports that Mr. Lin, the chairman of the Joint Association of Japanese Residents on Various Roads, yesterday submitted a petition to the Director-General of the Municipal Council, requesting the allocation of municipal funds to operate Japanese children's schools. The petition states that the Municipal Council's annual expenditure is 800,000 taels, which funds twelve schools educating 4,000 Chinese and Western children, including 2,600 Chinese students. However, no attention is paid to the 3,000 Japanese students residing in Shanghai, which amounts to discrimination.</p>
<h3>Meningitis Discovered in Wusong</h3>
<p>A meningitis epidemic has suddenly been discovered in Wusong West City since the day before yesterday. According to reports from local doctors, there have been at least six confirmed cases, with several suspected cases as well, but fortunately, all have been saved. Yesterday morning, Yang A'si, a twelve-year-old girl living at No. 5, Zhongxing Road, a vegetable vendor, who works as a child laborer at the Huafeng Yarn Factory in Yunzaobang, suddenly developed a fever and vomiting after returning home from the factory, and quickly fell into unconsciousness. Zhou Hongxuan, a doctor from Tongji University, was immediately called in for treatment. After diagnosing the illness as meningitis, Dr. Zhou immediately transported her to the Contagious Disease Hospital for treatment. As of last night, she had not yet emerged from danger. It is reported that the Sanitary Model District, upon hearing the news, has dispatched personnel to disseminate information about disease prevention methods to prevent the spread of the epidemic.</p>

Separate telegrams have been sent to the Egg Factory Association and circulated to all railways nationwide for compliance." This letter is hereby sent to inform you. Please take note. Sincerely, [Signed] to the Chinese Egg Factory Association."</p>
<h3>Three-Cent Stamps Used as One-Cent Stamps</h3>
<p>Due to Excessive Stockpiles of Said Stamps</p>
<p>The Zilin Daily reports that recently, letters in Shanghai have often been seen with three-cent stamps affixed, bearing a "Temporarily Used as One Cent" stamp. Upon inquiring with Post Office Director Li Qi, it was learned that since the increase in postal rates for out-of-town mail from three cents to four cents on November 1, 1925, the post office has accumulated a considerable number of three-cent stamps that are not easily sold. Fearing that they will deteriorate over time and waste public funds, the postal authorities have ordered that they be stamped and used as one-cent stamps. This practice is not limited to the Shanghai area; it is being implemented nationwide.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Foreigners Racing Horses in Suburbs</h3>
<p>Compensation Required for Damage to Farmland</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government previously received a petition from the Second District Chief requesting that foreigners be prohibited from racing horses in the suburbs to avoid damage to farmland. County Magistrate Leng then sent letters to the consuls of England, France, and the United States, instructing them to order their respective merchants to comply. It has now been learned that the County Government has received an order from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs stating that foreigners' horse racing in the suburbs is damaging agriculture and must be stopped immediately. If they do not comply and continue racing, any trampling and damage to agricultural products in the fields should be investigated immediately, and the consuls should be notified to order compensation in accordance with the amount, in order to protect agriculture. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Leng instructed the Second District Chief to notify accordingly yesterday.</p>
<h3>Seditious Leaflets Found During Pedestrian Check</h3>
<p>Liu Shifen Sentenced to Ten Days of Detention</p>
<p>Recently, public concession police stations have intensified their checks along the streets, and the timing of these checks is irregular, occurring at dawn, noon, dusk, or night, at any time and in any place, in order to eliminate anything that endangers public order. The night before last, after 7:00 PM, a joint Chinese-Western police inspection team from the Xinzha Police Station, while patrolling on Guling Road, found a suspicious individual. Upon searching his person, they discovered a bundle of propaganda material with absurd language, including phrases such as "Workers unite! Launch a second general strike! Overthrow the Nationalist Party!" These were clearly intended to incite those with weak understanding and disrupt public order. The police immediately took the person and the leaflets to the police station and yesterday brought him before the Provisional Court for investigation. Judge Luo interrogated the defendant, who gave his name as Liu Shifen, from Hubei province. The police then, through Lawyer Ru Baoyi, stated that after the defendant was taken into custody, he claimed that the leaflets were given to him by a friend named Liu at the New World entertainment center and that he was asked to deliver them to No. 11 Xiamen Road. The police dispatched detectives to Xiamen Road, and found that No. 11 was a rice shop and that they did not know the defendant. Therefore, his testimony was not credible. After further questioning Liu Shifen, Judge Luo sentenced him to ten days of detention and confiscated the leaflets.</p>
<h3>Women's Property Dispute Case Adjourned for Further Hearing</h3>
<p>Ms. Di Dingbao is in litigation in the Provisional Court with her brother, Qiu Shengsan, over the inheritance of the estate of their deceased paint merchant father, Qiu Weiqing. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qu Zongze specially opened the Sixth Tribunal for the hearing. The defendant did not appear. Zhang Shusen, the accountant from Zhenjiang, testified that the master, Qiu Shengsan, had left Shanghai for Tianjin in February. Although a letter was received from him at the beginning of this month, his address was unknown, so a reply was not sent. He recently sent a letter from Tianjin stating that he was going to Dalian, so his current location is actually unknown, and it is impossible to contact him to appear in court. The reason for his departure to Tianjin was that he had received threatening letters since the end of last year, so he had to temporarily leave Shanghai to avoid them. Judge Qu said to Zhang, "This case is a dispute between a brother and sister. If the defendant appears in person, it may be easier to reconcile. Since you have requested a two-month postponement on his behalf, he should be able to appear at the end of the period. For now, the request is granted. You should notify the defendant to appear in court before the 21st of April." Judge Qu then said to the plaintiff, Qiu Dingbao, "The defendant's request for a postponement is temporarily granted. If he still does not surrender within two months, the case will proceed according to law." Upon hearing the order, the plaintiff did not express any extreme opposition. Therefore, the court decided to postpone the case.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Strangled Concubine Case</h3>
<p>Brother of Murderer Arrested</p>
<p>Mother of Deceased Testifies About the Incident</p>
<p>Song Qiaobao, a 28-year-old female worker from Suzhou at the Japanese Shanghai No. 3 Yarn Factory, lived at No. 373 Hejian Road. On the morning of the 13th of last month, Qiaobao was suddenly strangled to death with a rope by her lover, Ma Shunlin, from Jiangbei, who also stole silver dollars and gold rings and fled. The circumstances of the deceased's examination have been reported previously. Since this incident, Ma's brother, Ma Shouting, and younger brother, Ma Shungui, have successively disappeared without a trace. On the day before yesterday, Chinese Detective Zhu Hanbo and Bao Detective Chen Youling of the Yangshupu Police Station learned that Ma Shouting was hiding in Zhangjiabang, Laobaidu, Pudong. They, along with Western Detective Tianerden, went to the address at 4:00 PM, arrested Ma Shouting, and brought him back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Seventh Criminal Tribunal of the Provisional Court. According to the police lawyer, Gan Jingxian, he requested a postponement. The Chinese and Western detectives then reported the circumstances of the arrest of the defendant, and presented the hemp rope that was removed from the deceased's neck at the time. According to Song Gao, "The deceased, Song Qiaobao, is my daughter. She and the fugitive, Ma Shunlin, were lovers. My son and daughter-in-law have passed away one after another. I now have a grandson named Erguan, only nine years old. I am sixty years old and have no support, so I regarded Ma Shunlin as a formal son-in-law. I came to Shanghai from Suzhou only fifteen months ago. That morning at 9:00 AM, Ma Shunlin told me to go out and buy noodles. When I returned, I saw the clothes chest in the room was open, and the clothes had been taken out and placed on the bed. One hundred yuan in the chest was to be used after my death, as well as two gold rings. The deceased also had 140 yuan and two gold rings, all of which were stolen. Ma Shunlin and the deceased were also both gone. I went to look for them near the back of the house, but could not find them. According to my grandson Erguan, he returned from school around 11:00 AM and saw Ma Shunlin leaving. Later, I went to the No. 3 Yarn Factory, and the report from the informant stated that the son-in-law's brother, Ma Shouting (the defendant), was searching for them. But he and his younger brother, Ma Shungui, also fled. The deceased was not discovered under the bed until 6:00 PM." The child, Song Erguan, said, "That day, I came back from school and saw the front and back doors closed. I knocked on the door, and after a while, my uncle Ma Laosan, that is, Ma Shunlin, opened the door. He gave me two copper coins and told me to buy something to eat. After a short time, I came back and saw Uncle Ma Laosan with his hands crossed as he slowly went out. Later, I heard my twelve-year-old neighbor tell me that Ma Laosan and my mother were fighting upstairs." When questioned, the defendant stated, "I did not know about Shunlin murdering Song Qiaobao. After the incident, the deceased's mother, Song Gao, came to the factory and told me. That day at 1:00 PM, I asked for leave to search for them in the Gaolang Bridge area and the riverbank, fearing that she would commit suicide by drowning. But I found no trace of them. I also went to Suzhou to search, because Shunlin used to be a policeman in Suzhou. He and the deceased also met in Suzhou. They came to Shanghai together and lived in the back building of my house. I searched in Suzhou for two days, but did not find them. I had to return to Shanghai and saw the news that Song Qiaobao had been murdered by her lover, Shunlin, and her body was found under the bed. I was shocked and dared not go home, so I fled to Pudong. My brother Shungui, I don't know where he has fled to either. I have nothing to do with this case." Judge Ge ordered the defendant to pay a bail of 300 yuan and adjourned the case for further investigation and hearing.</p>
<h3>Dumping Filth into Gutter</h3>
<p>Watching the Alleyway Man Repeatedly Advised</p>
<p>Pan Zhigen Gathered Crowd to Commit Assault</p>
<p>Pan Zhigen runs the Xinxing Printing House on Guangxi Road, and his family also resides there. His wife is not concerned about hygiene, and secretly dumps excrement into the gutter outside the back door of the printing house. When dumping, the stench spreads everywhere, causing passersby to hold their noses. Especially with the pleasant spring weather, it is particularly harmful to hygiene. If it accumulates for a long time and clogs the gutter, the trouble will be even greater. Therefore, Luo Zuqiu, the alleyway watcher, repeatedly advised Pan's wife, but she turned a deaf ear. At noon on the 14th of this month, she dumped filth into the gutter again and Luo witnessed it and stepped out to stop her. However, Pan Zhigen also sided with his wife and gathered the printing workers he hired, including Xie Yingtang, to commit assault. Luo's eyes were both seriously injured, and his face was scratched, with fresh blood flowing. It was only stopped after the neighbors intervened and mediated. Luo was unwilling to be humiliated and hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Pan and his wife, as well as Xie Yingtang, in the Provisional Court for assault, and requested that in addition to being punished according to the law, they compensate for medical expenses and other losses. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang opened the court for trial. Only Pan's wife appeared in court. The plaintiff first stated the cause of the conflict and submitted the injury certificate issued by Renji Hospital to prove that he was indeed beaten by Pan and the others. Judge Wang then questioned Pan's wife, and her testimony was evasive. She then ordered a postponement to wait for Pan Zhigen and Xie Yingtang to be summoned to court for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Appeal from Struck Fishing Boat</h3>
<p>The Ningbo fishing boat Xinyulong, loaded with sand and gravel, was coming to Shanghai when it encountered the Nisshin Company's Japanese ship Yueyang Maru at the exit and was sunk. The boat owner, Yu Rugao, specially submitted a report to the Shipping Administration Bureau to negotiate with the company. The following is an excerpt from the report: "Report concerning boat being sunk, requesting that compensation be ordered in order to demonstrate justice and show compassion. This merchant owns the fishing boat Xinyulong, with a load capacity of 65 tons, which has been engaged in transporting goods such as sand, gravel, paper, and wood, without any accidents. On this occasion, the Xinyulong was loaded with a ship of yellow sand from Changtu, Dinghai, intending to sell it in Shanghai. At approximately 8:00 AM on March 24th, while traveling near the power plant, there was a southeasterly wind and rising tide.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>The Xinyulong was sailing along the Puxi port side when, due to the fog, the Yueyang Maru ship was exiting the port and struck the Xinyulong's port side due to the fog. The middle cabin immediately sank. The Yueyang Maru also knew that it had caused the accident and stopped for about an hour. The Xinyulong crew negotiated with the Yueyang Maru crew, who agreed to send someone to the Nisshin Company to settle the matter. The ship then exited the port. Now that the Xinyulong ship has sunk in the port, it is clearly a shallow water area, which is evidence of the Yueyang's mistake. As the sunken ship is in the port, there are many ships entering and exiting, which is very dangerous. It is requested that your office consider the difficult situation and quickly order the company to estimate the compensation and arrange for the Xinyulong sunken ship to be salvaged in order to demonstrate justice and avoid accidents. Most urgently submitted to the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau."</p>
<h3>Changes to Electricity Supply Areas for Chinese-Owned Zhabei and Two Electrical Companies in Fahua and Pusong</h3>
<p>Filed with the Construction Committee with the Approval of the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Previously, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau temporarily assigned the Fahua and Pusong districts to the business areas of the Chinese-owned Zhabei and two electrical companies, respectively. Recently, for the convenience and economy of electricity supply, it was submitted to the Municipal Government for approval to use Daxi Road and Hongqiao Road as the boundary, dividing the two districts into northern and southern parts. The south belongs to the Chinese-owned company, and the north belongs to Zhabei. The Municipal Government submitted it to the Construction Committee for review. It is reported that the Construction Committee has now responded, approving the filing.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Announces Regulations for the Management of Livestock Farms</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, in order to prevent hygiene hazards caused by those engaged in the poultry and livestock industry, had previously submitted and obtained approval from the municipal government to issue "Regulations for the Management of Poultry and Livestock Product Stores and Factories." Since their implementation, they have been effective. However, poultry and livestock also carry the risk of transmitting infectious diseases to humans. After investigating, the Bureau found that livestock farms within the city, which engage in raising livestock and poultry, are also closely related to public health. Therefore, these livestock farms should also be managed to prevent disease. As such, the Bureau specifically supplemented and revised the aforementioned regulations the other day, submitting them to the Mayor for review. It is now known that the Municipal Government will repeal the previous regulations and formulate "Regulations for the Management of Livestock Farms and Poultry and Livestock Product Stores and Factories," which have already been announced. The text is recorded as follows: Article 1: "Livestock farm" refers to places where various types of poultry and livestock are raised. "Poultry and livestock products" refers to items such as feathers, hides, bones, meat, eggs, milk, intestines, blood, oil, and residue of domestic and wild poultry and livestock, whether processed or unprocessed. All those engaged in these matters must comply with these regulations. Article 2: Anyone establishing a livestock farm or poultry and livestock product store or factory within this special municipality to engage in the business of poultry, livestock, or their products must apply to the Health Bureau for registration and obtain a business license. Those who do not comply with these regulations to apply for registration will not be allowed to operate. Article 3: When applying for registration, livestock farms or poultry and livestock product stores and factories must report the following items: (1) Name and detailed address of the livestock farm or store/factory engaged in business. (2) Date of establishment. (3) Type of poultry and livestock raised or type of poultry and livestock products sold. (4) Whether the business premises' buildings and land are owned or leased; if leased, the start and expiration dates of the lease must be stated. (5) Average number of poultry and livestock produced annually, or the average number of products produced, stored, manufactured, or sold monthly. Article 4: Livestock farms or poultry and livestock product stores and factories must comply with all hygiene regulations of this special municipality. Article 5: Livestock farms or poultry and livestock product stores and factories must apply for registration once every year in January and pay a license fee of one silver dollar. Those who do not comply with these regulations to apply for registration will have their operations suspended. Article 6: Livestock farms or poultry and livestock product stores and factories must post the registration certificate issued by the Health Bureau in a conspicuous place for public viewing. Article 7: If the registration certificate is lost, the Health Bureau may be petitioned for a replacement, but the license fee must be paid again according to the regulations, and a public notice must be placed in the newspaper in advance. Article 8: Livestock farms or poultry and livestock product stores and factories must not be located in dirty or noisy areas. Each store and factory opened before the promulgation of these regulations may be guided to improve or be ordered to relocate by the Health and Civil Affairs Bureau at any time. Article 9: The buildings and all equipment of livestock farms and poultry and livestock product stores and factories must be cleaned and maintained at all times to emphasize public health. Article 10: These regulations may be amended at any time if there are any matters not covered. Article 11: These regulations shall come into effect from the date of promulgation by the Special Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Thorough Protection of the Pinghu-Shanghai Route</h3>
<p>The shipping route between Pinghu and Shanghai was once intercepted by bandits, causing passengers to be wary. It is now known that the bureau, led by Mr. Jiang Jiankang and others, specifically requested the Water Police Team to dispatch dozens of patrol boats to patrol along the route, so that they can assist at any time in case of an emergency. As a result, the protection is thorough, and travelers are safe.</p>
<h3>A Little Lioness Deceived in a Love Affair</h3>
<p>Cai Jiaqing Entices and Abducts</p>
<p>A woman from Bao Ying named Little Lioness, who is seventeen years old, has been working in the rough yarn section of a certain Japanese-owned yarn factory near Little Sand Ferry for two years. She resides in the workshop of her fellow villager Cui Shen, where she earns over four corners of wages each day. Over the past two years, she has accumulated fifty dollars in wages. A labor strike recently occurred at the yarn factory, and Little Lioness has been at home without work. She carried over twenty dollars, planning to go to the Chi Bang Bridge on Carter Road to buy clothes. On the way, she met Cai Jiaqing (nicknamed Jiaqingzi), a man who is known to be a loafer in the Little Sand Ferry area. Cai is twenty years old and from Dongtai. Little Lioness, not knowing the way, asked Cai for directions. Cai saw an opportunity and volunteered to guide her, asking her to take the tram with him. Unexpectedly, he lured her to a small inn near East New Bridge. He enticed her in every way, and Little Lioness, lacking knowledge, was raped. They stayed at the inn for four nights, and all her twenty dollars were swindled away by Cai. Yesterday morning, while Little Lioness was asleep, Cai took advantage of the situation and stole Little Lioness's new silk satin padded jacket and pants and fled without a trace. When Little Lioness woke up, the man was gone, and her padded jacket and pants were also missing. Realizing she had been deceived, she cried loudly in the room. Later, the waiter entered and asked about the situation, and demanded the two nights of rent owed, totaling ten corners. Little Lioness, having no way, begged the waiter to go to Little Sand Ferry and summon her landlady Cui Shen, who paid the rent and took her away in a rickshaw.</p>
<h3>Husband and Wife Accuse Each Other of Attempted Murder</h3>
<p>A woman from Yancheng, Hong Zhou, yesterday accused her husband, Hong Xiangshan, of plotting to murder her at the Fourth District Headquarters. According to Zhou's testimony, she is twenty-eight years old and lives in Fumei Lane, Haichang Road. She and Hong have been married for several years and were considered harmonious. Unexpectedly, he recently neglected his duty to provide for her and often abused her. The other day, she fled to her mother's house to avoid him. Yesterday, she went back and he suddenly confined her in a room, denying her food and drink. At night, while she was sleeping, he took a leather knife, intending to chop her head. Fortunately, she woke up in alarm and hurriedly left the bed, avoiding the murder. But her husband's intentions are treacherous, and it is difficult to live with him, so she reported to the headquarters to investigate. Hong Xiangshan testified that he is twenty-six years old and a leatherworker. He has always treated his wife well. However, starting this year, she often went back to her parents' home. When he tried to dissuade her, she did not return for several days. He secretly investigated and learned that she had a new lover. But he knew he was poor and that it was not easy to marry a wife, so he swallowed his anger and brought her back. Who knew that she would be so aggressive and would try to strangle him with a large rope while he was sleeping. Fortunately, he noticed it early and took a leather knife to scare her. Unexpectedly, she falsely accused him of attempted murder. Director Jin reviewed the testimonies and, considering the case involved a criminal matter and the testimonies conflicted, ordered that they both be sent to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Li Commits Suicide by Swallowing Match Heads</h3>
<p>Why Did Xu Jinchen Flee?</p>
<p>Xu Jinchen, a man from Danyang who runs a beef shop at No. 188 Huiwen Road, Zhabei, is twenty-five years old. His business has not been very prosperous, and his wife, Li, who is twenty-one years old and from Yangzhong, have a poor relationship and often quarrel. The other day, they argued again over trivial matters, which led to physical violence. Li, filled with resentment and lamenting her unfortunate fate, felt that life was not worth living. She secretly bought several boxes of "Black Head" matches, cut off the heads, and swallowed them with liquor. At nine o'clock that night, she was poisoned and rolled around on the bed. Xu, realizing she had taken poison, sent her to Jishi Hospital for treatment, but it was too late, and she died. Xu, fearing punishment, fled. The police have been notified and have reported to the local court to send someone for examination.</p>

<h3>Suing for Illegal Sale of Company and Assault</h3>
<p>Wang Hou'an, a man from Sichuan, retained a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the French Court, stating that the plaintiff and Wang Boqin, Wang Kuilü, Wang Hongbin, Ye Huasheng, etc., jointly established the Chuan Yu Company on Avenue Edward VII. Unexpectedly, last year, the defendant Wang Boqin and others privately sold the company to Qiu Dongrong. In reality, Wang Boqin bought it himself, secretly colluding with Qiu Dongrong as the buyer. After the plaintiff discovered this and made accusations, they ignored him. The defendants are guilty of embezzlement. Also, last winter, the defendant Yu Boqin beat the plaintiff's daughter for no reason and kicked her, causing injuries. There is a Western doctor's certificate to prove this, which constitutes the crime of assault. He requested the court to investigate. The defendant, Wang Boqin, retained lawyer Fei Xizhen to defend, stating that the plaintiff's accusation of assault is without definite evidence and the regulations cited by the plaintiff's lawyer cannot be established. As for the business dispute, it is a civil matter, and the plaintiff had already acknowledged the sale at the time, for which there is evidence to prove. How can he go back on his word? He requested that the plaintiff's accusation be dismissed. Wang Kuilü, Wang Hongbin, and others retained lawyers to make a defense. Qiu Dongrong also retained lawyer Ba Yun to defend, saying that his client invested in buying the business through legitimate procedures and the plaintiff should not be involved for no reason. He requested that the plaintiff be severely punished. Chinese and Western officials reviewed the testimonies and declared the debate concluded, to be decided later.</p>
<h3>Car Crash Causes Wall to Collapse, Killing a Person</h3>
<p>Wang Jinxian, a twenty-year-old construction worker from Jiangbei, lived at No. 175 Sanguantang, Xieqiao. On the 24th, at the doorway of the wall west of the French Concession Police Station on Rue Massenet, a cargo truck No. 752 driven by Zhang Haitian, a driver from the French Public Works Bureau, was driving by. For some reason, the front of the truck went onto the sidewalk, causing the wall to collapse, crushing Wang's head, causing profuse bleeding. The police arrived, recorded the license plate number, and sent the injured person to Guangci Hospital for treatment. They also reported back to the head of the detectives for review. Wang died of his injuries shortly after being admitted to the hospital. The hospital notified the police, who had the body taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall mortuary for examination. The police ordered detectives to notify the deceased's father, Wang Yushan, and witnesses Bai Hongsheng and Xu Sandi to come to the station. Yesterday morning, Mr. Zhu, the judge from the Vehicle Affairs Department of the French Court, arrived at the mortuary at 11:00 AM and confirmed that the deceased had indeed died from injuries sustained in a car accident. Because the deceased's family was poor, he ordered Tongren Fuyuan Hall to provide a coffin and burial and await submission to the court for review.</p>
<h3>Autopsy of a Prisoner Who Died of Illness</h3>
<p>Qian Zaijin, a thirty-one-year-old man from Shaoxing, committed a crime in the French Concession last autumn. The police arrested him and sent him to the French Court, which sentenced him to imprisonment. Now, Qian fell ill while in custody and was sent to Guangci Hospital by order of the prison warden, but he died in the hospital on the 23rd at 3:30 due to his serious illness. The hospital notified the prison, and the body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall mortuary for examination. The police ordered detectives to summon the deceased's wife, Qian Zhang, to the station. The wife prepared a coffin and went to the mortuary the day before yesterday to collect the body and store it in the Bing building of the Zheshao Guild Hall.</p>
<h3>Autopsy of a Male Corpse in a Cemetery Confirms Death from Illness</h3>
<p>An unidentified male corpse was found in the Jinjiaqiao Cemetery in Yangjingbei, Pudong, the other day. The local security reported it to the local court for autopsy. Upon instructions, the corpse was taken to the court for examination. Yesterday morning, the local security took the corpse to the court, where prosecutor Yang and two autopsy examiners, Shen Xuan, etc., arrived at the scene. The corpse was found to be about fifty years old, with a mustache, wearing a melon-shaped hat, a fake Zhigong woolen padded robe, black cotton-padded jacket and pants, a striped cloth shirt, and a sanitary undershirt. However, the words "Ding Jiyu" were written on all of his clothes. There was a three-button wallet beside him, with the words "Chinese Public School University Department Ding Shunxing Laundry Service." There were no injuries on his body, and he had died from illness. It was certain that this person was Ding Jiyu of Ding Shunxing, but it is puzzling why he died in the Jinjiaqiao Cemetery, which is ten miles north of Yangjing. The body has now been photographed and taken into custody by the court to await identification by relatives.</p>
<h3>Questions About the Fire in the Warehouse</h3>
<p>If No One Went In or Out, Where Did the Fire Come From?</p>
<p>A man surnamed Deng from Pudong, who runs Juyu Yarn Shop at No. 115 Wangjia Wharf, Nanshi, has his family living separately at No. 2 Yong'an Lane, Dongjiadu. Deng, because the goods in the shop have recently become crowded and insufficient for storage, set aside another room in his home to store yarn goods and forbade idlers from entering. Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, a fire suddenly broke out in the warehouse room. In an instant, smoke filled the air, and the flames blazed, making it impossible to approach. Soon after, the fire brigades from various districts learned of the fire and immediately drove to the scene to put it out, which they were able to do quickly. Afterwards, the patrol police from the area took Deng's shop assistant back to the First Section of the First District. The section chief preliminarily interrogated the assistant. Because the room only contained goods and no one went in or out, where did the fire start? Moreover, it was found that he had insured the fire for over three thousand taels. Therefore, there are many suspicious points about the cause of this fire. He immediately ordered a written report to be submitted to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Swindling Furniture from a Brothel by Posing as Carpenters</h3>
<p>Ding Ziji Furniture Shop in Xiaoximen rented sixteen pieces of mahogany furniture to the Su Yuan brothel on Fourth Avenue. The other day, swindlers Xiong Jinggen, Li Jinbiao, and Jin Zixiang, posing as workers from Ding Ziji, went to retrieve them. The brothel, unaware, was deceived into giving them the furniture, which they then pawned for cash. When the brothel asked Ding Ziji to return the receipt, they learned they had been swindled. Therefore, the furniture shop filed a complaint with the Second Section of the Second District, and the police dispatched officers yesterday to arrest Xiong and the others. They were then transferred to the local court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Robbery of a Crate Shop Related to Store Employees</h3>
<p>Confessions of the Three Arrested Thieves</p>

Yesterday afternoon, the Hua detective Wang Changgen and Bao detective Shi Bao Ying from Huishan Police Station arrested Lu and the other three in the Broadway area. They were taken to the police station, where it was learned that Zeng Linsheng was an employee of the crate shop who colluded with Lu and Yin to carry out the robbery. They reported this to the head of the detectives, who ordered them to be detained and sent to the Provisional Court for trial.</p>

<h3>China Foreign Famine Relief Committee – Report on the Disaster in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>The China Foreign Famine Relief Committee received an investigative report from Wang Shaohan, the President of the Bao Ying, China, and Anglican Church, and Pastor Meng Gemei, stating that on the 7th of this month, Han and Pastor Meng went to the disaster area to examine the households in detail. Even the grain eaten by chickens and dogs and the food consumed by rats are gone. The disaster victims eat water plants and wheat bran, which they cook and swallow. Tofu dregs and dried sweet potatoes are considered supreme delicacies. The feces in the latrines are no different from pig manure, indicating that there is no food in their stomachs. They cannot speak audibly, and they walk unsteadily, on the verge of collapse. They are barely alive and may not last until the next day. It is unbearable to look at them. Some have hanged themselves because they have no food to feed their children. Families are crying, and even the most hardened person would shed tears. The corpses of those who have starved to death in the makeshift shelters in the burial grounds are piled up everywhere. Alas, the dead are gone, but how will the surviving disaster victims be saved? The above is only what we saw in the villages thirty miles from the city. It is said that twenty or thirty miles further east, the disaster is even more severe than what we saw. We urge you to quickly grant a relief fund of at least ten thousand yuan to save the imminent needs of tens of thousands of lives. In addition, the famine victims' representatives from Xinghua County, the township head of Shangjiao Township, Shu Jiashu, and others, sent a letter stating that the disaster situation in their area is extremely tragic. Countless strong men have fled to other places. The elderly, weak, women, and children are unable to move and have nowhere to beg, so they eat grass roots and tree bark to fill their stomachs, causing many to have swollen faces. From winter to spring, countless people have died. The refugees will soon return, and there will be even more people without food. The disaster is unimaginable. Therefore, we have no choice but to urgently plead for you to quickly release relief funds to save the disaster victims.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Panic Regarding the Holy Mother Statue in Rome</h3>
<p>— Qiu Shui</p>
<p>Since Soviet Russia implemented the anti-religious movement, the killing of priests and the destruction of churches in the country have been reported daily in the newspapers. It is not necessary to elaborate further. Even abroad, the Soviet Russian Communist Party is planning to destroy Christianity. Recently, Western newspapers published a communication from London on the 15th, stating that a large number of secret Soviet Russian groups have arrived in Rome to engage in anti-religious work. Because Rome is the residence of the Pope and the center of global Christianity. The Soviet Russian Communist Party started with its center, which can be said to be cunning. After the secret Soviet Russian group arrived in Rome, their first demonstration was to destroy the statue of the Virgin Mary in the Vatican Gardens in Rome's Wantie Kaihua Garden. The statue was established by Pope Alexander III. It has a long history and is a huge project. Not only is it carefully maintained and worshiped by people in the church, but even visitors from afar cannot help but look up and admire it when they pass by. The Roman church was extremely panicked after hearing that the secret Soviet Russian group had arrived, and they gathered to discuss protection measures. But after a long time, nothing was heard. However, nearby residents have since heard the sound of a pack of dogs barking wildly under the statue late at night. The sound is sharp and long, as if there were bandits approaching the door, and giant mastiffs were rising up to resist. So the people told each other that the Pope had recently raised fierce mastiffs to protect the Holy Mother. Although the Soviet Russian Communist Party is violent, they will also encounter setbacks. Those who are superstitious about the way of God even said that the Holy Mother showed her spirit to resist the violent. That is even more ridiculous. I do not know that there is no dog next to the statue of the Holy Mother. The barking sound at night is a secret mechanism, not that there are hundreds of giant mastiffs to protect this statue. The church people have discussed good plans for protecting the statue, as mentioned above. Among them, there is a priest named Father Lulgi Marmagg, an expert in wireless electricity who has ingenuity. First, he provided a wonderful mechanism. The method is to connect the gramophone record of the sound of dog barking with electricity, install a speaker, and secretly place it on the right side of the statue, and then connect the yin and yang wires to the statue's surroundings. A trigger is set up separately. If an uninvited guest approaches the statue, the foot touches the trigger, the yin and yang electricity are connected, and the gramophone starts automatically, communicating the sound to the speaker. So the sound is as loud as the barking of a pack of dogs. The installation of this machine was very secret beforehand. Only the priest and his assistant knew about it. Therefore, on the second day after the machine was completed, the Pope happened to be touring the area, and his foot suddenly touched the secret machine. In an instant, the dogs barked wildly, as if they were about to pounce and devour him. The Pope was shocked and immediately avoided him, ordering the guards to patrol, but he found nothing. The priest told him about it, and they all laughed. It is also an interesting event. According to history, this kind of machine is not a new invention. The most famous one is the palace of the ancient Emperor Solomon, where there were fake lions roaring to protect the royal chamber. Khan of the ancient Byzantine also set up a mechanism. Whenever foreign envoys paid homage to the palace and approached the throne, there was the sound of lions roaring to surprise foreigners. Today's Roman priests are just imitating his method. Only the skill of its machinery should far exceed that of ancient times. It can be asserted.</p>
<h3>A Small Robbery in Bailuzhou</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>There are quite a few famous scenic spots in the capital. Bailuzhou is also one of them. It is located in the southeast of the city. You can reach it after a few hundred steps across the Qinhuai River. Although it is not very secluded, it also has a charming garden and fresh air. It is rare to find this area full of singing and music. Moreover, it also has the famous line of the poet saint Li Bai, "The two waters divide Bailuzhou." Unfortunately, the army was stationed here last year. The pavilions, trees, and plants were severely damaged. Stones were stacked to make stoves, and bricks were piled up to make toilets. Cooking here, urinating here. Bailuzhou in the area has become a camp. Recently, when I went there, although the stationed people have moved away, the glorious notice of protection from the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs has been posted. But it is still full of desolation and the relics have not been completely removed.</p>
<h3>The Mystery of the Barbershop</h3>
<p>— Yan Ye</p>
<p>Any barbershop always has two cylindrical things of about two feet long and the size of a bowl as a trademark in front of their doors. Red, black, and white colors are painted on them, spiraling upwards, like three belts. Electricity runs through the middle, making them spin endlessly. At night, electric lights are installed inside, making them spin really interestingly. People in the countryside are often attracted to stop and watch when they first come to Shanghai. Some, even if they don't use this cylindrical spinning thing, will definitely paint the same two on the flat surface in front of the door. I have long suspected this thing. Why is it necessary to use this thing as a trademark? I asked many people, but they didn't understand. Sometimes they even asked me instead. Later I thought that the barbers themselves would eventually know. I didn't know that when I had a haircut, I asked five or six shops, but they all didn't know why. They just said that it was an old trademark passed down for many years. People who have returned from abroad say that the trademarks of barbershops in all countries of the world are also this thing. So I concluded that this trademark must be universal, and its origin must be abroad. Recently, I asked someone who is familiar with foreign stories, but he still didn't dare to say for sure. He said that he heard that there was a surgeon in Europe in the past. He used this spiraling thing as his trademark. Because amputations and broken feet require bandages, the three colors on the pillar are the pictographic representation of bandages. Later, he abandoned his benevolent medical practice and became a barber, who worked on the top of the head. But although he changed his profession, he did not change his trademark. Each barbershop found his logo to be interesting, so they unconsciously imitated it. It has only been spread to various countries until now. After he finished speaking, he solemnly said, "I really dare not decide whether this explanation is true or false." Then this mystery still cannot be revealed.</p>
<h3>The Swan of the Library</h3>
<p>— Xiao Peng</p>
<p>The swan is a water bird. It is also known as the swan. It always lives in lakes and swamps. It is not often seen daily. A swan was obtained by the Public Library of this county (Tongshan) the other day. It was given by Liu Buzhou, a person from the county. It turned out that on a certain night in the first ten days of the first lunar month of this year, when Liu was in a deep sleep, he heard the sound of rustling in the yard. Suspecting that there was a thief, he got up, dressed, and lit a candle. But the door was still the same. There were no burglars. Later, he saw an object in the corner of the yard. Seeing that it was completely white, neither a crane nor a goose, he was surprised by it. So he tied it in the courtyard. Later, someone came to see it and recognized it as a swan. Liu felt that it was a waste to raise it in his home, so it was better to put it in a public place for public viewing. Therefore, he donated it to the library. The swan is larger than a goose. Its feathers are white and glossy. Its beak is flat with a black front end. Its legs are short. Its feet are webbed. Looking at it, you know it is a waterfowl. Now the curator, Li, has built a wire cage field on the vacant space in the library. A pool is built inside, and a wooden house is connected next to it for the bird to swim and rest. Every day, people come to see it in an endless stream. They all say that the swan's arrival here is no less than a person falling behind. Red Velvet</p>
<h3>Spring Opera News</h3>
<p>— Liu Henwo sent from Beiping</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, famous actors in Pingzhong have been competing to perform new songs. Such as Shang Xiaoyun's complete Legend of the White Snake, Ma Lianliang's Scarlet Robe, Hao Shuchen's Hongmen Banquet, Zhu Qinxin's The Phoenix Fate, Zhang Eyun's Apricot Yuan and the Barbarians, Xue Yanqin's Pan Si Cave, Xin Yanqiu Yang Xiaolou Yan Jupeng's Overlord Meets Yu Ji, etc., are actively rehearsing to appeal to the audience.

Only the temporary change of selling horses was changed, and Dong Junfeng's Caoqiao Pass was added. Xin Yanqiu's complete Mandarin Duck Tomb. Yang Xiaolou's Iron Dragon Mountain with Upper Slope. Famous actors and excellent plays gathered in one place. Wu Caixia, who had not been heard for a long time, was old and aging, and she was inevitably old. However, her voice was the same as before, and her charming voice was moving. Xin Yanqiu is even more the pride of today's singing arena. He imitated Yu Shuang with great effort and was very similar. Every move was thunderous with applause, which was enough to be proud of.</p>
<p>Yuan Shihanyun came to Ping from Tianjin on the afternoon of the 7th.

It is said that it will be necessary to wait for Guan Dayuan to return from Shanghai before a date can be chosen for the performance.</p>
<h3>He Tuna Study</h3>
<p>— Juemi</p>
<p>Every early spring, when river pufferfish emerge, there are incessant reports in newspapers of people dying from eating them. The name "river pufferfish" is not consistent, and their shapes probably vary as well. Therefore, I am writing a "He Tuna Study" and submitting it to this journal.</p>
<p>"Trust extends even to piglets and fish" is found in the Book of Changes. The name "river pufferfish" has been around for a long time. Zhuangzi once saw Zi eating his dead mother, and the piglet was sometimes written as 㹠. The Erya dictionary says that "鯸鮔" is the "魨." It has a green back and white belly, and it gets angry when touched. Its liver is deadly. The "鯸鮔" mentioned in Erya is likely the river pufferfish. The "Compendium of Materia Medica" says that the "魨" looks like a tadpole, with the larger ones being over a foot long. Their backs are greenish-white with yellow streaks and no scales. Their gills and eyes can puff up, and they are poisonous. It is also called "鯸鮧," "鰗鮧," and "䲅魚," originally written as "豚." The "魨" mentioned in the "Compendium of Materia Medica" is also the river pufferfish. The "Classic of Mountains and Seas" says that the Dun River flows eastward into the waters of Yanmen, and there are many "䰽" fish in it. Eating the "䰽" fish is deadly. The "Compendium of Materia Medica" says that this is the "鯸鯃." Therefore, the "䰽" fish mentioned in the "Classic of Mountains and Seas" is also the river pufferfish. Zuo Si's "Rhapsody on the Wu Capital" mentions "𩵭, tuna, and 鯸鮐." The commentary says that "鯸鮐" looks like a tadpole, with the larger ones being over a foot long. The belly is white, and the back is bluish-black with yellow patterns. This is exactly the same as the description of "鯸鮔" in Erya. Therefore, the "鯸鮐" mentioned in Zuo Si's "Rhapsody on the Wu Capital" is also the river pufferfish. Wang Chong's "Discourses Weighed in the Balance" says that salmon liver is deadly. Lei Gong's "Treatise on Preparing Herbs" says that salmon is also called "䲅魚" or "嗔魚." Rihua Zi calls it "鰗魚," and today it is called "river pufferfish." The "Compendium of Materia Medica" says that "䲅魚" is also called "鰗鮧." When touched, it gets angry and puffs up its belly like a balloon, hence the name "嗔魚." It has a white back with a red line like a seal. Its eyes can close, unlike other fish, and this is the river pufferfish of today. Therefore, the salmon and "䲅魚" mentioned in "Discourses Weighed in the Balance" and the "Compendium of Materia Medica" are also the river pufferfish. It can be known that "鯸鮐," "河魨," "䰽魚," "鯸鮐," "鮭魚," and "䲅魚" are all names for the river pufferfish, and "鯸鮧," "鰗鮧," and "嗔魚," etc., are all alternative names for the river pufferfish. The poison of the river pufferfish, as recorded in various books, is all in the liver. This is something that anyone who eats river pufferfish must know.</p>
<h3>Paper Kite Talk</h3>
<p>— Yang Yixiao</p>
<p>Gongshu carved a wooden kite that flew high. At that time, there were only kites and no paper kites. Later, when Hou Jing besieged Taicheng, Emperor Jianwen made a paper kite to send an urgent message to the outside world. This was the beginning of paper kites. During the Five Dynasties, Li Ye of the Han Dynasty and Emperor Yin made paper kites outside the palace and flew them. The "Record of Diverse Matters" says that today's paper kites are flown with strings, and children watch with open mouths, which can release internal heat. Who would have known that paper kites would be transmitted abroad? The great American scholar Benjamin Franklin invented aerial electricity because of them. Today, the research on paper kites in the West is making rapid progress, especially in England. There are paper kite competitions, which are extremely popular.</p>
<h3>Warmth on My Heart (156)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Fiery Flames Light Up the Pavilion, Filial Daughter Admired; Red Carpet Laid Out, Famous Actors Met</p>
<p>That Weichun Garden is rented out to people for meetings. You just need to negotiate with the garden owner a few days in advance, and if you offer a reasonable rental price, he will agree. However, when there are intense meetings, he often doesn't get what he deserves. Why is that? Those meetings are all for public benefit, so the daily rental price requires him to help out, and he can't ask for too much. When the meeting is in progress, anyone can come, because it's open to the public. They crowd his big Western-style house, called Andy, until it's packed like sardines. Some people are squeezed in the back and can't see who the speaker is, so they step on the chairs and tables, breaking the chairs. With so many people talking at once, who can you ask to pay for the damages? I remember one time, for the sake of some Russian volunteer team, a national assembly was held in Zhang's Garden. At that time, the spirit of the Chinese people was being stirred up. It was said that the meeting would start at 2 o'clock, but by 1 o'clock, it was already packed. Several patriots had just returned from Japan. Like the current senior statesman of the party-state, Mr. Wu Zhihui, he had also just returned from Japan. Today, he would be giving a speech, and even more people came. He gave a very passionate speech, and at the most emphatic point, he would punch the table. By the end, his voice was hoarse and his fist was swollen, but he had also broken the mahogany table. After this meeting, after everyone had left, the garden owner inspected the equipment. Thirteen chairs were broken, one mahogany Eight Immortals table was smashed, and more than a dozen teapots and teacups were broken. Who could he ask for compensation? He could only admit his bad luck. However, Zhang's Garden, because meetings were always held there, has a very memorable record in history. Some of the current great figures of the party-state still remember it. Moreover, meetings are always held on Sundays, and Sundays are the busiest days in Zhang's Garden. The foreign clerks and the "masters" from the brothels also come to Zhang's Garden on this day to ride around in horse-drawn carriages. Zhang's Garden has a road built in a circle, so you can go from the east side to the west side. Therefore, those dissipated playboys and enchanting beauties, famous courtesans and national scholars are often crowded together. Fortunately, that Weichun Garden is inclusive and does not discriminate. There are elegant events and vulgar events. There are orchid shows, chrysanthemum shows, and on good days in spring and autumn, many people gather to compose poems on assigned topics and form poetry societies. That can be considered an elegant event. However, there are also often instances of adulterous grooms and actors, and dirty pimps fighting over jealousy. They would make appointments with gangsters, and each would call on their own henchmen, bringing iron rulers and knives, and fight it out. These kinds of things often happened in Zhang's Garden. This can be considered extremely vulgar, but it's not a big deal in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Finance: Gold Standard Moves Steadily Forward</h3>
<p>The overall trend is strong, firm yet stable. Yesterday, the 25th, the gold standard trended steadily, continuing to show an upward trend. The market situation was relatively stable, with only two or three mace (a unit of weight) fluctuations in the forward and backward markets.

In the early market, Chengfeng, Yongfu, Yufu, and Dalian banks bought slightly, while Fuchang, Yuancheng, Yongfu, Xingyong, etc., sold. As large gold bars frequently shrunk, the customs saw high prices.

Later, Yucheng, Yongheng, Xingda, Decheng, etc., bought in, while Zhifeng, Yongjin, An'yu, and Da lost sales initially, retreating below 96 taels, and then immediately rising, driven by bullish buying.

Banks mutually traded at 11.375 pence for this month, 4375 for April. Xingye bought forward Citibank at 47.6875 yuan, with June British gold settling at 11 pence 4375.

Banks mutually traded at 11.5 pence. After 3:30 pm, it was 6.56 mace, and then slightly pulled up a few qian. At the closing time of 4:30 pm, it was 97.3 mace, an increase of 1.4 mace compared to the previous day. Approximately 10 taels less pressed.

<h3>Bond Market Turns Slightly Quiet</h3>
<p>Disbandment Bonds Rise by 5.5 Jiao, Other Fluctuations</p>
<p>Yesterday, trading in government bond futures turned quiet, and the market mood was sluggish. The total transaction volume in the forward and backward markets was over 5.7 million yuan, with customs bonds accounting for about 2 million yuan, rehabilitation bonds for nearly 1.3 million yuan, continued loans for over 1 million yuan, and other bonds were quite quiet. The spot market transaction volume was 33,000 yuan, of which the central disbandment bonds accounted for 27,000 yuan due to active trading in small denominations, rehabilitation bonds for 4,000 yuan, and financial bonds for 2,000 yuan. The bond prices were stable as the bond market environment was calm and the market mood was more subdued. Prices fluctuated by only a few jiao in the forward and backward markets.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Turns Firm to Cover Short Positions</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose slightly, but the overall situation remains weak. The underlying inventory is too large. The stock of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd yarn is extremely large, and sales are quite lacking. As farming activities in various villages will soon be busy, yarn sales will decline further. Therefore, most people expect prices to fall. Without special changes, it will be difficult to increase prices. The seller is currently delivering 4,500 bales of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd yarn, 1,000 bales of 10-count Peacock yarn, 300 bales of Three Sheep yarn, 100 bales of Double Happiness yarn, and 500 bales of Bao Yi yarn, totaling 6,400 bales, into the warehouse. This huge volume of delivery has severely impacted the market. It has been found that a large firm in the market has been covering short positions for two days, estimated to be as high as 6,000 to 7,000 bales, so the market appears to be slightly tight.</p>
<p>The current month's yarn rebounds by one tael. At the morning opening of the exchange, the situation was relatively stable. Those who had short positions bought to cover, and the market sentiment was slightly firmer. Various brokers went above, and most short sellers closed out. As a result, this month fell by 0.08. The consecutive months fell by 1.11 to 1.3 qian. In the afternoon, 40-count cotton was used to offset short positions, the number of bales was relatively large, and some outsiders used low-priced goods to act as long positions, the market situation was firmer, and various months rose by 0.02 to 0.07 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 19,350 bales. The closing prices of the exchange are recorded below.</p>
<p>Exchange Name Closing Price Increase/Decrease Inventory Closing Price Increase/Decrease Inventory</p>
<p>March 15.17 Up 0.10 17,300 June 15.24 Up 0.06 24,500</p>

<p>May 15.21 Up 0.06 32,950 August 15.30 Up 0.05 18,180</p>
<p>Yarn Sales are Weak and Spiritless: Current yarn sales are bleak. It is found that the total purchased by various guilds for the day was 905 bales, and the inflow among the trade was 315 bales. The market sentiment was average. Among the customer guilds, the inflow from Xuzhou was the largest, accounting for 280 bales. In addition, Qingdao was 135 bales, Guangdong was 80 bales, Shantou was 25 bales, Tianjin was 100 bales, the interior was 100 bales, Yantai was 45 bales, Sichuan was 40 bales, and miscellaneous guilds were 105 bales.</p>
<h3>Local Cotton Diverges from Foreign Markets</h3>
<p>The cotton market was stable in the morning and firm at noon, but the overseas cotton market was trending down, while local cotton was stable, due to the tight situation on the market. There was a lack of new sellers, and the source of Han cotton remained scarce, so the Han guilds were tightening and unwilling to loosen up. However, current yarn sales are sluggish, and the factory demand is increasingly stagnant, it was said.</p>
<p>Futures Cotton Rises Slightly to Cover Short Positions: At the opening of the Han cotton exchange in the morning, the market fell slightly. However, as selling pressure was not strong, retail investors covered short positions, and prices rose slightly. Farther months fell by 0.05 to 0.01 qian. In the afternoon, the market situation suddenly became strong, and various months rose by 0.05 to 0.02 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 27,800 dan. The closing prices of the Han cotton exchange are recorded below.</p>

<h3>Overseas Yarn and Cotton Prices Show More Declines Than Gains</h3>

<h3>Grain: Rice Market Sees Repeated Price Increases</h3>
<p>Top Grade Japonica Rice Already Called at 21 Yuan</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the supply of goods coming down the river became increasingly scarce, and inventory continued to deplete. Therefore, buyers became increasingly eager to purchase, and sellers inevitably raised prices to sell. As a result, top-grade white Japonica rice was even quoted at 21 yuan. Ultimately, ordinary high-grade Japonica rice traded at 20 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen. Overall, prices for mid-grade and lower-grade rice all increased by 1 or 2 jiao. According to these prices, it is the first time ever in Shanghai. Bo Dao also turned upward, and Hakka groups had some transactions, which enlivened the market. Yang Xian still had sources, but the quantity was extremely small, so it was sold out immediately upon arrival. Sales increased by 1 jiao and 5 fen. Du Zi, Ke Bu, and other Xian rice were scarce on the market and also lacked arrivals. Therefore, although they appeared to follow the tightness, there were not many transactions. Bian Yin Yuan rice was consistently firm, with strong buying interest and an excellent situation.</p>
<p>Hu Nan: Goods coming down the river were still scarce, and sales were very brisk. Chang Bang Japonica and Su Tong Japonica rice were frequently raised in price due to rising production prices and special Hakka groups actively purchasing in the producing areas, which caused Lian merchants to wait and see. This affected the source of arrivals in the port. Recently, due to the unrest in the current situation, unscrupulous merchants took the opportunity to profit, causing rice prices to rise repeatedly in both producing and selling areas, endangering the people's food supply. If the authorities in the local and foreign ports do not take measures to provide relief, Shanghai will soon be cut off from supply, and strange market conditions will inevitably appear immediately, and the hidden dangers are worthy of attention. Nan Bang Bo Dao rice saw only a slight firming in prices because store sales and restaurant demand were both average. Yang Du Jian saw the best market conditions because goods were scarce and sales were brisk, raising prices by 2 jiao. Bai Yuan rice saw varying degrees of brisk and slow sales on this street. Sales depended on picking out the higher quality rice. Large quantities followed the general trend and rose by more than 1 jiao. The number of dan traded throughout the day was quite strong, more than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Futures for Foreign Rice Continue to Open at 5,000 Tons</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice had smooth inland business and was favored by this street. The market continued to be good. Existing spot rice inventory was low, and new arrivals were awaited. Market prices rose secretly by several fen. It is estimated that 300 bags of Min Dang, 2,000 bags of Xiao Jiao, 500 bags of No. 1 Saigon, and 4,000 bags of land cargo were opened, also favorable by several fen. Futures were initially optimistic, but the market turned stable due to a foreign firm selling the remaining 1,500 tons. In total, over 5,000 tons were opened, with mostly revolving contracts.</p>
<h3>Standard Flour Makes More, Soars Again</h3>
<p>On the day of the merchant, the various months of the morning, because of foreign grain prices, did a good job of one or two corners, and the people's minds were generally stable, mostly, and still saw the pace of closing in April and May, so that the people inside and outside the industry, no matter what, all had the ears of the rise, until the afternoon, the opening of the market, because of the large number of bulls, the prices were still raised for April, May and June, so all the months were soaring step by step. Most of the big and small factories took this opportunity to sell quite smoothly, and the Tianjin gang also had no gaps. The only goal of the big players is to take advantage of the fact that wheat stocks are running low, and the prices of rice, the main food, are soaring everywhere, so speculators are buying up a lot of wheat, so this kind of price increase seems to be purely man-made, and not due to the mismatch between supply and demand. As a result, this month rose by 1 fen and 7 li half compared with the previous day, April and May rose by 1 fen and 2 li half each, June rose by 1 fen half, July rose by 1 fen, and August rose by 1 fen and 2 li half.</p>
<h3>This Month's Wheat Retreat is Uniquely Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, the trend of each month after the opening of the market in the morning and afternoon, was quite inconsistent. This month, due to the imminent delivery, the shorts were all prepared to deliver, and most of the longs, except those who were prepared to receive the goods, were seeking to close out their positions. Therefore, although the flour market was good and foreign wheat rose slightly, the market was sluggish. The distant months all showed a bullish trend because outsiders were still optimistic and trading was also heavy. After this, if the flour market rises again, it will naturally still be considered stable. As a result, this month was better by 2 fen compared with the previous day, April was better by 2 fen, and June, July, and August were better by 1 fen each. Spot market conditions were still stable, but what was offered was all medium and lower grade, and there was very little high grade. It was heard that 9,350 bags of Suzhou wheat, Qingjiangpu wheat, Xuzhou wheat, and Anqing wheat were offered at 5 taels and 1 qian, 5 taels and 5 fen, 4 taels and 9 qian and 5 fen, Hunan wheat at 4 taels and 7 qian, Jiangxi wheat at 5 taels and 5 fen, 5 taels and 3 fen, 5 taels, 4 taels and 9 qian and 8 fen, and 4 taels and 8 qian and 8 fen, and were handled by Fufeng and Shen Da.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Actual Sales Rely Only on This Street</h3>
<p>There were no changes in the piece goods market yesterday. Actual sales only showed a gradual increase in this street, because the weather is getting warmer and clothing materials for single and lined garments are being launched. Yesterday, striped silk and Fu silk from East China were selling very briskly. Qing Guan Jing was sold out at 3 qian and 5 li. A new batch of Arrow-Lai Tu arrived and was sold at 3 qian and 1 fen. Yang Guifei was also sold quite a bit at 3 qian. Three Talents printed calico was offered at 3 qian and 9 fen, Three Horses at 4 qian. Printed Ceylons with better patterns were also mostly sold out, with prices all around 2 qian. Fine broadcloth also had daily sales. Huxinting Bald Blue Gray was offered at 2 qian and 3 fen yesterday, miscellaneous colors at 2 qian, 2 fen, and 7 li half, and Hundred Sons at 2 qian and 2 fen half. Mainland gangs transacted over 100 pieces. Wenming Xifa Ceylons also showed a gradual shortage. Mei Lanfang Foreign Beauty was sold out. Da Deli was offered at 1 qian, 8 fen, and 2 li half, with more purchases from this street. Sichuan-Hubei gangs were still sluggish, due to the unrest in the current situation. Western goods were stable. Zhuluo gauze saw over 20 pieces purchased by the Fujian gang. De Ji and Tai He goods were all at 3 qian and 7 fen half.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Hardware Sales are Desolate</h3>
<p>The hardware market has been extremely quiet recently due to the treacherous environment and sluggish sales among the various gangs. The entire city, except for a slight embellishment in fancy goods, has no one touching the main products. Fortunately, market prices are firm, so most peers do not have any sense of panic. Recent arrivals have been quite numerous, so the hardware products circulating on the market are exceptionally abundant. According to those familiar with the inside, if there are no arrivals on the market in the next two or three months, there is no fear of shortages.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Xiamen Kumquat Cake Quotes Have Already Fallen Significantly</h3>
<p>"Xiamen Kumquat Cakes" have recently arrived one after another, but sales have become sluggish among the various gangs, so prices have fallen back. Current quotes have already fallen significantly compared to before, and sales have not improved. "Golden Kumquat Cakes" have been lacking arrivals for a long time, and market inventory is exhausted. It is heard that production is still underway in the producing area, and they are expected to arrive around the end of the month.</p>
<p>"Gordon Euryale Seeds" have become increasingly affordable recently due to sluggish sales. The market currently only sees scattered transactions. Yesterday, Chi Gordon Euryale Seeds sold for 189 taels, and Nan Gordon Euryale Seeds sold for 72 yuan, with a flat trend. "Hao Red Dates" were opened for sale from another truck yesterday. The quality of the goods was average, and the price was 6 taels and 8 qian. "Lower Grade Round Meat" market inventory is gradually thinning, and recent arrivals have been lacking. Yesterday, market quotes rose by half a tael, and sales are also gradually becoming active.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse and White Granulated Sugar Gradually Trend Upward</h3>
<p>Yesterday, New York sugar futures for May were 1.79, September was 1.83, and December was 1.91, each up 2 points. Java spot sugar and April futures were both at 10.50, and May was at 10.75, each up 0.0625. In the Guild market, Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white saw active buying interest. With rising prices reported from other markets, market sentiment turned firm, and reduced warehouse releases caused prices to increase. Buyers were still eager to purchase, so the market rose again. The initial market price was 7 taels and 2 qian, and warehouse releases were particularly scarce. It then quickly rose to 7 taels, 2 qian, and 2 fen half. Although there was no significant increase in the later market, the market situation was very bullish. Finely ground granulated white sugar was at 7 taels, 2 qian, and 7 fen half, with very few transactions. Japanese sugar was slightly stable. "N" mark was at 7 taels and 8 qian, and YT mark was at 7 taels, 6 qian, and 2 fen. Transactions were very desolate.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Japanese Silk is Weak, Progress in Selling Chinese Silk is Difficult</h3>
<p>Yokohama Japanese silk is still weak and sluggish due to the sharp rise in the Eastern exchange rate. Yesterday, the market price for spot silk was only 1,165 yen, making it difficult to increase sales of Chinese silk in Europe. Overseas telegraphs report that silk prices are not high, but Chinese merchants are unwilling to sell at a loss because their stocks are insufficient and silk costs are still high. Transactions were even lower. Yesterday, only about 30 bales of white filature silk from Yu Deng were shipped to Shanghai, and about 20 bales of white dry spun silk from Da Chang, with prices all stable.</p>

<h3>Pinghan Railway: Introduction to Shunting Design - Zheng Baozhao</h3>
<p>In the future, the improvement and development of all new undertakings in our country depend on making full use of the effects of modern scientific inventions. Therefore, the adoption of European and American technologies and systems for railways is indeed a major issue today. However, the key lies in having a long-term vision and meticulous consideration, understanding the current situation and future needs, and then making wise decisions to determine the appropriate policies. Furthermore, a detailed plan should be the standard for implementation, ensuring that facts and theory are perfectly aligned, so that the desired results can be fully achieved.</p>
<p>The train dispatching system is currently the most innovative and perfect system for railway traffic in the world. The remarkable achievements in enhancing transportation capabilities and economic benefits are undeniable. We will leave aside abstract theories and prove it with substantial figures. The London Midland Railway in England adopted the train dispatching system in 1908. According to the railway's statistics, the average weekly train delay time in 1907 was 21,869 hours. After adopting the train dispatching system, it decreased year by year, reaching only 7,749 hours in 1913, a reduction of 64% compared to 1907. The following lists the train delay hours for each year on that railway to demonstrate the improvement of traffic operations:</p>
<p>Average Weekly Delay Hours</p>
<p>1907 21,869</p>
<p>1908 14,501</p>
<p>1909 11,680</p>
<p>1910 9,546</p>
<p>1911 8,959</p>
<p>1912 7,878</p>
<p>1913 7,749</p>
<p>If we further compare the delay time of freight trains during the same period with their revenue, it becomes even more meaningful. In 1907, one hour of freight train delay occurred for every 7 pounds and 8 shillings of revenue. In 1913, one hour of delay occurred for every 22 pounds and 4 shillings. Furthermore, from the perspective of transportation economics, the railway's total freight tonnage in 1913 was 50,500,300 tons, an increase of 3,237,000 tons compared to 1907. The freight revenue in 1913 was 13,297,000 pounds, an increase of 830,750 pounds compared to 1907. However, while tonnage and revenue increased, the train mileage actually decreased by 1,650,000 miles compared to 1907, and coal consumption was reduced by 93,160 tons. Passenger transport also achieved similar results. Due to space limitations, details cannot be listed here. However, even from the comparison of the numbers mentioned above, the improvement in transportation economy and efficiency brought about by the train dispatching system is already astonishing.</p>
<p>This is not unique to the Midland Railway alone. All railways in the British Isles, its territories, and both the European and American continents that have adopted this system have achieved considerable results. If the internal turmoil in our country subsides soon, social order is restored, and various construction projects are implemented in turn, then as a result of the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce, the railway transportation capacity and economy urgently need to be substantially improved. Given the backward state of the existing railways, all locomotives, vehicles, and other equipment must be greatly expanded. The number of trains will become increasingly frequent with the surge in transportation demand. Therefore, the urgent need to adopt the train dispatching system is beyond doubt. However, since the railways in the world that have adopted this system vary greatly in terms of route length, equipment completeness, and the nature and volume of transportation, there are bound to be differences in the extent of their organization, operation, and scope of authority. Before planning to adopt this system for our country's railways, we must conduct a thorough study of the established rules of advanced railways in the world, selecting the most important ones.</p>
<p>Now, let us first discuss the railways in England and its territories.</p>
<p>The railways in the British Isles that have adopted train dispatching include the London Midland and Scottish Railway, the London and North Eastern Railway, and the Great Western Railway.</p>
<p>In other parts of the British Empire, there are some railways in India, the South African Railways, the Federal National Railways of Canada, and the Federal Railway of Malaysia. Although the systems they adopt vary, the scope of duties managed by the dispatching system is generally limited to the following: (1) Ensuring the punctuality of trains. (2) When regular trains are insufficient to meet transportation needs, operating supplementary trains for livestock, perishable goods, and other freight. (3) Utilizing locomotive traction power to achieve complete results, and handling transportation in the most economical way possible within the possible range. (4) Loading trains to the maximum limit. (5) In the event of an accident or track obstruction, changing train routes or canceling trains. (6) Closely considering the volume of transportation, expecting to operate entire trains of freight cars, transporting them over the greatest distance, and reducing stopping points to the minimum. (7) Adjusting the transportation of neighboring large stations. (8) Finding ways to transport goods that cannot be transported by ordinary methods. In addition, there is the expansion of the scope of train dispatching, including the allocation of vehicles, the regulation of loading and unloading matters, the management of the rotation of drivers, firemen, and other train personnel, and the assessment of their work to avoid exceeding hours, as well as the compilation of timetables and traffic diagrams. As for its overall organization, it can be divided into the following four categories: (A) Establishing a central dispatching office to manage the operation of the entire line. (B) Dividing the route into several sections, with a dispatching office established in each section subordinate to the central dispatching office, and the central dispatching office auditing the dispatching matters of each section. (C) Dividing the route into several sub-sections, each with a sub-section dispatching office directly under the jurisdiction of the relevant main section dispatching office. Each main section dispatching office is in turn subordinate to the central dispatching office, as is the case with the Midland and Scottish Railway. (D) Dividing the route into several sections, with a dispatching office established in each section subordinate to the section chief of that section. Some have established a central dispatching office, such as the Great Western Railway, while others have not established a central dispatching office, such as the London and North Western Railway.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about the railways in the United States.</p>
<p>Most single-track and double-track railways in the United States use the Dispatching System, which directs the transportation affairs of a railway section from a central location. Its main purpose is to operate a large number of trains in the shortest possible time to achieve economic efficiency in operating costs. The Standard Code promulgated by the American Railway Association is a common rule followed by American railways. According to the provisions contained therein, all train dispatching matters are placed under the control of the dispatcher. The dispatcher is subordinate to the chief dispatcher. His ordinary powers are as follows: (A) Ordering the departure of trains. (On single-track lines, he can change the meeting and overtaking locations. On double-track lines, he directs trains to enter sidings or double-track lines, and determines the meeting locations of trains whose schedules have not been determined. Also, to avoid congestion on the lines, he may advance the departure of freight trains when necessary.) (B) Canceling regular trains or special trains. (C) Managing the operation of shunting locomotives, material trains, or worker trains on main lines. (D) Adjusting or supervising train loading according to transportation conditions. (E) Dispatching special trains, shunting locomotives, or rescue trains. In addition, there are dispatchers on some railways who must adjust the transportation of docks and terminal stations. On other railways, the chief dispatcher is responsible for handling this function. There are also dispatchers on some railways who are responsible for handling the shift changes of train personnel. Furthermore, there are dispatchers on some railways who are only responsible for preventing drivers, firemen, and train personnel from violating federal laws. Dispatchers on other railways have no right to interfere in this matter. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Hebei's Measures for Collecting Road Maintenance Fees - Wu Fei</h3>
<p>After a road is built, in order to benefit from it permanently, maintenance is essential. However, road maintenance relies on funding, so the source of funding is naturally an important issue. Recently, Hebei Province has formulated twelve articles of regulations for collecting road maintenance fees, which have been approved by the provincial government and implemented. After examining the measures, they are worthy of emulation. I have recorded the main points here for guidance. According to Article 7 of the organizational outline, the Hebei Provincial Road Bureau collects road maintenance fees. Therefore, the provincial roads are divided into three grades: first-grade roads are those with high traffic volume and difficult maintenance, second-grade roads are those with low traffic volume and easier maintenance, and third-grade roads are those that have been leveled and padded from existing official roads and can be used by cars. The vehicles allowed to travel on provincial roads are limited to seven types: cars, four-wheeled carriages, flat-wheeled carts, flat-wheeled sedan chairs, electric bicycles, bicycles, and rickshaws. All other vehicles and livestock are not allowed to pass. Therefore, according to the grade of the road and the type of vehicle, all vehicles traveling on provincial roads shall pay road maintenance fees according to the prescribed rates: (A) Cars: For first-grade passenger cars with 20 to 30 seats, the road maintenance fee is $1.10 per Chinese mile per month; for second-grade passenger cars with 10 to 20 seats, the road maintenance fee is $0.80 per Chinese mile per month; for third-grade passenger cars with less than 10 seats, the road maintenance fee is $0.50 per</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>Chinese mile per month. The road maintenance fees for first-grade freight cars with 2 to 3 tons, second-grade freight cars with 1 to 2 tons, and third-grade freight cars with less than 1 ton shall be the same as those for the above three types of passenger cars of the same grade. In addition, for cars traveling on first-grade provincial roads within 100 Chinese miles, the road maintenance fee shall be charged according to the above-mentioned rates; from 101 to 200 Chinese miles, the monthly road maintenance fee shall be reduced by 5%; from 201 to 300 Chinese miles, the monthly road maintenance fee shall be reduced by 10%; and from 301 to 400 Chinese miles, the monthly road maintenance fee shall be reduced by 15%. Those traveling on second-grade roads shall be charged 70% of the fee, and those traveling on third-grade roads shall be charged 50% of the fee. (B) Four-wheeled carriages shall be charged $13 per month. (C) Flat-wheeled carts with a double team shall be charged $6 per month, and those with a single team shall be charged $3 per month. (D) Flat-wheeled sedan chairs shall be charged $3 per month. (E) Electric bicycles shall be charged $12 per month. (F) Rickshaws shall be charged $0.50 per month. From this, we can see that the amount of the fee is determined by the distance traveled, and the standard for collection is determined by the type of vehicle. Moreover, all these vehicles, regardless of which grade of provincial road they travel on, shall be charged separately according to this example, which can be said to be in accordance with legal principles and appropriate. However, there is no supervision of the vehicles traveling, so it is stipulated that vehicles traveling on provincial roads must apply to the responsible provincial road bureau for a license plate on a monthly basis, indicating it on the vehicle for inspection. Those without a license plate are not allowed to pass. If business cars must first apply to the relevant provincial road bureau for registration and obtain a license before applying for a license plate. The registration rules for long-distance business cars will be separately stipulated. After various vehicles have been registered and approved and issued a license, they shall exchange their license plates monthly and pay the full monthly road maintenance fee at once. If anyone does not obtain a license plate or fails to exchange it after it has expired, and travels privately, once discovered, in addition to obtaining a license plate and paying the normal fee, they shall also be fined one to three times the amount of the fee. For various private cars that pass temporarily, the road maintenance fee shall be charged at three-quarters of the above-mentioned rates calculated daily. If charitable organizations and government agencies use vehicles for relief or to facilitate paperwork, and they must pass through provincial roads, they may be exempted from road maintenance fees if they notify the relevant provincial road bureau in advance and obtain a license. In addition, if county road bureaus build roads and the construction costs are high, and road maintenance also requires collection, the county governments may stipulate and submit it to the provincial construction department for approval and record. All of the above are Hebei Province's measures for collecting road maintenance fees. Various places can extract the strengths of the regulations and stipulate the collection of road maintenance fees according to local conditions so that the construction of roads always has funding and is free from the danger of road surface collapse and increased danger.</p>
