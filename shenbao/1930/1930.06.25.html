<p>時評</p>
<h3>世界不幸之報告</h3>
<p>近來所有國際新聞。大抵不外商業之衰頽。失業人數之增加。證劵之暴落。以及各殖民地爭自由不得之擾亂。即以今日所得而論。如印度對於調查報告之不滿。日本證劵之續跌。埃及國會之紛擾。西班牙廠工之罷工。以及法意間形勢之緊張。法國之鞏固邊塞工程。日本之决定新國防計畫。凡此之類。皆非可以樂觀之事。而日日發生。有增無减。此豈世界之幸事哉。</p>
<p>綜其原因。不外兩端。其一爲受工業過分發達之反動。商業有自然衰落之趨勢。因之而以工商業立國之國家。不能不受此驟變之影響此乃出於逐漸而來之不可抗之人工。斷非枝節改革所能一時挽救者。其二由於人類爭勝尚力之心。不能根本覺悟。因之而和平縮軍之議。雖接踵而起。而多數人之不忘武力。依然如故。故一有齟齬。而最後之注力。仍依賴乎此。人類間此種危機。濳伏日見其甚。一旦有事。觸發甚易。有此二因。世界消息之多不幸報告。無足怪也。</p>

<p>乙丨有時我也相信。但是命運有好與不好之分。</p>
<p>甲丨是的。我自信命運很好。你不見那邊有一個衣服鮮艶而肥胖如母猪一般的婦人麽。</p>
<p>乙丨是啊。這婦人未免肥胖得太難看了。但與你的好運有何關係。</p>
<p>甲丨我在五年以前曾向伊求過婚。伊拒絶我。</p>
<p>病腦者丨醫士。近來我的腦筋似乎有病。不論做甚麽事。總是容易忘懷。你有甚麽法兒能强烈的提醒我。</p>
<p>醫士丨我每逢月底。將醫藥費的賬單開給你。</p>
<p>甲丨我近來焦憂極了。每晚睡熟之後。往往在睡夢中起來行走。</p>
<p>乙丨我却求之不得。要是我也能在睡夢中行走。那麽我得投往警察署去。請地們派我做一個值夜巡邏的警察。倒可以多一筆額外的收入。</p>

<h3>追悼范烈士記唐鐵</h3>
<p>烈士名爭洛。河南修武縣人。上海特别市黨部常務委員范爭波先生之季弟也。年少氣宏。志清行峻。服膺三民主義。尤能終始不渝。故仗劍鋤奸。忠勇果毅。而待人接物。篤信多情。歷充市訓練部助理幹事。及公安局稽查。每見其黽勉從公。兢兢任職。爲黨服務。奮不顧身。雖反動者銜之至深。而烈士常一笑置之。坦然不以爲意。其奮鬭精神。英勇卓絶之氣。非特爲時下所罕覯。且亦黨中不可多得者也。去年八月回籍。與張文華女士結婚後。未逾蜜月。即束裝來滬。以供原職。其許身黨國。毋以家爲之忱。尤足令人肅然起敬。不幸於十一月十一晚。值反動者濳伏於法租界環龍路之和合坊。竟被狙擊於其私邸。一時噩耗所至。全市爲震。迄今半載有餘。黨中同志。咸悼念不置。乃於一昨二十二日。由市監察委委應鵬先生曁全市諸同志。私人發起舉行范烈士追悼大會。會塲假市黨部三樓大禮堂。中設烈士遺像。兩側陳列烈士臨難時之衣履。血跡彈痕。宛然在目。令人對此。哀悼彌深。上午十時開會。到會者有市長張羣代表俞鴻鈞。公安局長袁良。社會局長潘公展。敎育局長陳德徵諸先生。曁各團體代表與其親故等百數十人。先由</p>
<h3>小職員之常識·汪·新·寶</h3>
<p>你要將你比做機器上的一個螺絲釘。位置雖小。責任不小。</p>
<p>勿估他人之值。勿嫌已俸之微。你果然辦事認眞。首領决不辜負你。</p>
<p>起初與你最要好的人。結果往往是你最有惡感的人。「君子之交淡如水。」三復斯言。</p>
<p>與你同等位置。而年紀遠高於你的人。你應當格外敬重他。因爲他的才能縱或不及你。他的經騐閱歷必高於你。</p>
<p>人家待你一分誠意。你倍之。即使結不出深交。最低限度認你是誠實人。</p>
<p>假使同事請你陪首領宴會。你搶着會鈔。這不是客氣。這是荒謬。</p>
<p>邂逅首領於娱樂塲中。你槍着會鈔。這也不是客氣。這是討厭。</p>
<p>朱應鵬先生主席。行禮如儀。繼由陳克成同志報告烈士生平壯烈事略。袁潘陳諸局長。曁市民訓會委員陶百川先生。皆有極沈痛之演說。末由范爭波先生答謝。先生登壇即向烈士遺像行三鞠躬禮。乃涕泣濳然。悼痛不能成語。足見友愛之深。來賓皆不忍座聞。會場莊嚴肅穆。備極榮哀。樂聲悠悠。殊爲悲壯。四壁輓聯祭軸。滿目琳瑯。諸多喟悼。如市長張聯云。劇變驚心。陡使鴿原傷折翼。英年賷志。忍敎梅雨賦招魂。袁局長聯云。佳偶甫儷鸞。忍輕抛似錦韶華。不惜忘身爲黨國。平坡驚落鳳。况親見猶生面貌。應留浩氣壯山河。朱委員聯云。忠實獨推君。每當集會宣言。祇知有黨。彌留猶託我。即此滿囊遺物。足見多情。余亦輓以聯云。天下未澄。清范滂云亡。竟因黨事。心中常痛惜·唐衢隕涙。非係私情。其餘全市各團體曁各區黨部區分部所贈誄詞聯語。美不勝收。限於篇幅。兹不多錄。聞不日尚有市部公誼舉行之盛大追悼。同享者。并有郭情釗烈士焉。</p>
<h3>鎭江趙聲公園之一瞥馬恊衷</h3>
<p>吾邑有鐵甕之名。負金焦之勝。南有招應隱之佳境。北有北固之勝蹟。惜離城太遠。不便於遊。今幸西城外南馬路旁。有趙聲（烈士）公園之設。該地交通便利。遊人所喜。值此春夏之交。予因公返里二日。適蒙高朋過我有約。遂聯袂一往遊焉。是園雖設備尚未完全。而外觀壯麗。其間草木叢生。野花吐秀。怪石林立。綠葉隂醫。幽靜令人生羨。園之旁有屋數椽。蓋即快活林茶社。一爲凌烟閣照相館也。其建築亦頗古雅。堪爲公園之點綴。其西巍然聳立者。著名之銀屏山也。滿山叢竹。清翠欲滴。登其巓觀鐵甕勝狀。銜遠山。吞長江。浩浩森森。令人心曠神怡。有身在蓬萊之概。山之下有小池。一泓清水。游魚出没其間。旁有小屋。其形如燕翼者。即公共演講廳也。入其中。窗明几靜。秩序井然。遂稍息焉。此外尚有亭臺數處。皆足引人入勝。惜夕陽西下。暮色催歸。遊人四散。故不復登。返寓時。已萬家燈火矣。</p>
<h3>湖山消息湖鶯</h3>
<p>回憶去年今日。正西湖博覽會開幕時期。孤山一帶。車水馬龍。游人如織。熱閙異常。洵盛會也。今則去閉幕已久。各種臨時建築物。次第拆除。故又換一番新面自矣。爰將最近聞見所及。誌之於後前西湖博覽會大門。數週以前。即行拆</p>
<h3>南洋遊記（三五）靈花</h3>
<p>初二日。與人在國語學校討論國語事余已在該校講演數次。國語運動者。南洋爲必需。次於飲食。因種種隔膜。社會空氣阻滯。均因各地土語隔絶人感情之故。對面與外人無異。閩粤之語。各有十數種。各不相通。以前常因此起誤會而生械鬭。近漸好矣。有柯達文君專來此。爲國語統一運動已開數次大會。甚望其能促進也。但南洋近年國語已發達。較吾人身歷廣東福建省其開通流利。已甚高遽矣。因近年與祖國關係漸多。故少年亦肯習國語。以前則認國語爲無用。又僑生少年已與土人同化甚多。多操英語及馬來語。自非有祖國關係事。久忘其爲華人矣。且輕視華人。經近年運動。頗有聯絡動機耳。</p>
<p>一部分人頗有主廢漢文。而用羅馬字拚語。或將來用世界語者。但世界語今力尚微。羅馬字亦不便利。今日本尚不能廢漢字。漢人何能廢之。記從前北京出一雜記。名大砲響了。專討論廢漢字問題。我以爲太早計。我常與西人談歐洲十餘種文字。其實全歐人數不過與我華等。而我華只一種漢文通用通行。自關外至南洋全球。即日本等國。亦屬漢朝以來。字無變化。故能同化一切文明比之歐洲走一千里則殊文。經三百年則文字語尾變化者。其便利相差甚遠矣。由此言之。文明程度在此不在彼也。不過中國東南數省。同音而不同字。一整齊之。便爲完善。至若廣西大半雲貴語言。皆極似中州。而四川兩湖江西語言不難通。自江以北至東三省陜甘。均一道同風。則中國語言。何嘗難統一乎。至海外國語運動。則關係絶大。次於經濟問題。即是國語。願僑胞努力焉。</p>
<p>去馬路爲之一寛。金碧輝煌之新奇建築物。祇可見於攝影中矣。</p>
<p>斷橋左側。向有一亭。中立古碑。由來久矣。日前不知何故。忽行拆除。古碑已運到何處。不得而知。殊爲殺風景之舉。大約此亭亦因交通關係而犧牲也。</p>
<p>杭州電廠新設用户娱樂電影院。院址即前裏西湖大禮堂。建築設備。可謂週至。實爲吾杭最高尚之娱樂塲所也。所映各片亦爲歐西名産。如珍妮蓋諾之「七重天」。琵琵但妮兒之「大姑娘」。已先後映演於杭州士女之前矣。</p>
<p>立馬吳山之革命先烈陳英士先生銅像。位於湖濱。落成已有一載。今更於石基四週。加植奇花異草。并圍以鐵欄。較前益爲壯觀。惜銅像飽受陽光沙灰。色彩暗淡。似非加以油漆不可。</p>
<p>湖濱之陣亡將士紀念塔。大部份完成久矣。今已將四面碑文刻就。字作金色。與紫綠色之大理石。相映極美。并於石基之上。蓋以玻磚。晚間電炬放光。五色繽紛。泃奇觀也。</p>
<h3>誌她們的私慾欣俯</h3>
<p>今日世界。一私慾世界也。試問人類中。無論智愚老少。有能屏棄私慾者乎。最近美國電影界有鑒於此。因作她們的私慾一片。出而問世。稱她們而不稱他們者。其或因她們之私慾。更甚於他們歟。該片爲米曲羅公司最新出品。完全歌舞對白。情節離奇。不落尋常窼臼。且能將她們的私慾。發揮無餘。發人深省。主演者爲大名鼎鼎之女明星瑙瑪希拉。在此片中飾一新式女子。表演深刻。使人迴腸盪氣。而歌聲宛轉。亦令人心醉神移。且伊在好萊塢中。素以善游泳聞。今在一茫茫無邊之大湖中。表演驚人之游泳技術。尤屬不可多見。兼之配角如魯意史東等。均係銀幕上之俊傑。於是相得益彰。其背景百分之八十。均係攝諸野外。山水秀麗。風景絶佳。使觀衆如置身瑞士之日内瓦湖畔。而一葉孤舟。顚撲於驚濤駭浪中。又足驚人魂魄。尚有一幕。則數十歌女。舞蹈湖濱。麗影輕盈。倒映湖底。誠屬洋洋大觀。兹聞該片方公映於南京大戲院云。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（二二○）包天笑</h3>
<p>第十二回别宴離筵拈花留倩影名園嘉會鬭茗覩芳姿</p>
<p>左詩晨道。那就好極了。伊其實完全還是一個小孩子。初進門時。有你隨時招呼。自然要好得多。阿金道。那也不見得。總之章大少雖然是個財主却實在是一個好人。年紀自然比較大一點。然而像這樣年紀討姨太太。也不能算大。人家到六七十歲討姨太太的也有咧。今天還有笑話咧。阿金說時。把眼睛朘着蕊雲。說阿要告訴二少。蕊雲道。告訴就告訴他。横豎他是「立在雲端裏看相打。」一切都是百弗關的。蕊雲說這話時。好像掠過一種輕蔑微嗔的眼光。阿金道。有一個客人。是姓桂的。寗波人。他的朋友。都叫他阿桂。阿桂就此叫出了名。連堂子裏也都叫他阿桂了。他只叫過幾個堂唱。客也不曾請過。人是眞漂亮。年紀又輕。眞正是個小白臉。今天老早就同了一位姓趙的趙大塊頭。到生意上來。那時大阿姨小房子裏也没有出來。他們兩人。把我摘到一個小房間。趙大塊頭便問我道。阿有介事你們阿囡要嫁人咧。我只好說不曉得。嫁人不嫁人。是伊娘做主的。他說你假痴假呆做什麽。外面的人通知道了。你一天到晚同阿囡在一塊兒的。豈有不知道之理。聽說已經付了五百塊錢定洋的了。但是阿囡爲什麽去嫁這一個土財主。現在桂大少。他也思討你們阿囡。他們出多少錢。桂大少也肯出多少錢。你可以去和大阿姨說說。把這五百塊定洋退了吧。桂大少這樣一個人。又是漂亮。又是年輕。瞎子也摸了桂大少去。我說這事我不管。你自已給大阿姨說去。趙大塊頭道。你問問阿囡看。阿囡總贊成的。只要阿囡願意的。我們用律師包打聽。拔也拔了伊出去。我一想這事不好。不要弄假成眞。但是阿囡說阿桂是個垃圾馬車。浮而不實的人。我告訴了大阿姨。大阿姨有點膽小。所以今天媽媽虎虎出了幾個堂唱。明天就不出了。告訴你二少。阿囡明天不住在生意上也說不定咧。左詩晨道。呀那末明天起。就很難見你面了。蕊雲道。你要來。可以問阿金。阿金會告訴你的。左詩晨摇頭道。那我不便來。舉起玻璃高脚杯裏半杯的葡酒。蕊雲也不期然而然的舉起伊面前碧緣的小半杯薄荷酒。左詩晨道。那末我們就在這一杯酒裏告别</p>

<p>猛烈而不斷的前進昨（二十四日）標金漲風尤厲、惟市况複雜、倐忽問計有三四兩進退變幻靡常、人心迷亂也、午前以在六百十兩内外藴伏、午後趨勢鋒芒、大有蒸蒸日上之象、終日共計十一兩之曲折、外匯已濳挺堅、銀行有所賣出惟掛價回長一檔而各號交易尚勁、如泰興萬興天裕等買進、元茂水祥裕順利則已售出、福昌志豐永等求供無常自早間大條銀略長、買方不懈、故反見漲、繼則略軟復呈良好、後市泰興恒興餘大等皆進、元茂永生大等賣出也、而價步上青雲殆因買户甚勤、良以謡言現金已面出口之消息、於是引起一般人激昂之心理、大　飛騰之象風波洶湧、猛漲八九兩有奇、續已出現六百十九兩之高峯矣、惟間有二三兩之迥顧、然上漲之程序、尤爲迅速、匯票殆亦堅挺、而市况之變遷甚烈、令人不可推測耳、至昨大條已長八分之一、銀市亦加八分之三</p>
<p>暴露飛越的端倪八月份開盤爲六百○九兩四錢、計加一兩四錢、毛盤互有二兩增減、由六百○八兩一錢漲爲十兩先令揭曉雖已加長二五、美金五角日金掛小二分、但不爲所動、實乃買方殷勤内盤亦堅、上海買九月份六辨士、台灣出五辨士九三七五、遂又遞增三兩計達十三兩一二錢、入後日銀行出八月美金三十六元一八七五、十月份互做三十六元四三七五、故略下游、自九點三刻後計有二三兩起落志豐永等有所出售、直至十一點後濳勢見挫乃大户福昌等賣出也、計跌去四兩餘、惟匯票交易不旺、計爲六百○八兩四錢、倐忽間跳上三兩十一點半、爲十一兩四錢、有人追進也午時空方抑小登賬、故又見六百○九兩三四錢迨正午收盤六百十兩○四錢、</p>
<p>收市抬至十八兩八後市開出六百十兩○九錢、後大户奮購泰興等均進、並謡言現金又有出口之風說、人心一躍千丈、且外匯尤挺、近期日金銀行納進一兩三錢六分三七五七八月先令麥行·三井均出五便士八七五、一霎時風起雲湧鋒利異常飛漲六兩、三點後爲十七兩二錢旋因印匯回大、福昌等賣出故退却三兩、至三點五十分時爲十四兩二錢、此時恒興則進往後起落於十四五兩之間、至四點後風浪尤緊、市氣堅靱、場内浮多者抬高不鬆、英金益挺銀行心思甚健、遂又哄上四兩數錢、迨散市際、竟出現十九兩之奇價、四點三十分收市爲六百十八兩八錢、</p>
<p>做撳五十除兩比較二十三日復騰十兩○八錢有奇、查一日間最大價十九兩最小價○八兩一錢、計有十兩九錢高下、故前後兩市雙登賬、午前七月份六百○八兩、八月十兩、午後七月十三兩、八月十五兩、補水上午○八兩、下午十三兩、揭價改爲六百六十七兩八、計抑小五十七八兩午後計撳五十兩左右、物品早開○九兩二錢、午收十兩○七錢、下午十兩○八錢、收市十八兩、</p>
<p>廣帮出少進多同業買賣計福昌·志豐永·恒興福餘·源太等出入不一、大德成·祥裕餘大·元茂永均出萬興·元興永·太興·天裕永、元康祥均進、下午太興·元成永順利均進、萬興·生大·益餘·福昌·祥裕均出、恒興·出少進多、尚有各號時有購售、心思不一、大連帮賣出八百餘條、買進五六百條、廣帮出少進多、約共二千餘條、</p>
<h3>外滙明暗盤互異</h3>
<p>昨匯豐掛牌各滙均已放長一檔、蓋銀市回長故耳、計英金長二五、爲一先令五便士六二五、美金加半元計三十五元六二五、印度加半元計九十八羅比、法郎加十二元、計九百○八元和洋加一元、計八十八盾半、德匯加二元、計一百四十九馬克五、坡匯減二兩二五、計一百五十七兩七五日金减二分、計一兩三錢八分五、香港加五錢、計八十五兩五錢、至内盤反趨緊張、午後尤挺、正謂明暗各殊標金漲風益熾、市氣生色華商投機家及恒興·福昌·大連帮等咸已扒進、銀行心理挺堅、計英金成交二十餘萬鎊曾扒結十餘萬麥加利·臺灣·三井·住友·東亞等均有售出惟上海略進各行互做五六萬鎊、又對做美金十萬元、亦有金業中扒進二十萬元、住友朝鮮售出也、而日金僅賣出現期數十萬元、由三井正金納進也、迨結果價比較前日計元令縮二五、美金縮五角、日金漲二分、人　堅晨、市氣鋒利、</p>
<p>英匯内盤計有一八七五上落、自上午六七月出價一先令五便士八七五八月九三七五九月六便士、買價照加○六二五、收市六七月出價五便士七五、八九月八一二五、買價照加○六二五、</p>

<p>昨據倫敦電訊、大條銀均復稍見回長、如近期加長一二五、爲十五便士六二五、合英金爲一先令六便士半、遠期亦長一二五、計十五便士四三七五、脚地印度略有吸進、市面平平、又接紐約電訊美銀價回升三七五、計三角三分六二五、英對美加上零三一二五美對英升零六二五同計四元八角五分九零六二五、日美勿更、仍爲四十九元四三七五、日英仍計二先令○四三七五、英滬先令加長三一二五、計一先令六便士三七五、又本日上午十點十分路透電日美加上零六二五、爲四十九元四三七五、日英仍計二先令零四零六二五</p>
<h3>厘堅定拆遞增</h3>
<p>市塲概况昨日厘漲形勢略覺和緩、而以銷胃不弱、人心仍昂、好在就近各埠陸續有小數來源、本街方而彚集亦足彌補、加之同業每日收解除額軋抵是以供方亦頗裕如、結果漲風頓息、價格回落七毫半、惟銀根氣象、以半年結賬期匪遥、收解差額距離、逆料必大、是以亦有趨昂之舉</p>
<p>厘拆價格（洋厘）早市爲七錢二分三厘六毫二忽半、較前日午市之昂價略跌六毫二忽半、午市更復回小一毫二忽半、爲七錢二分三厘半、惟人心趨向、仍不軟滯、厥後恐尚有一度激昂也、（銀拆）早市爲一錢八分、較前晨忽漲六分、午市加落三分、計爲一錢五分、銀行掛牌七分、劃頭以出欵多、頭襯充斥、結果白劃</p>
<p>輔幣市情江南小洋、市上現貨甚少、交易亦稀、以致市價無人競爭、遂無軒輊可言、早市爲六錢三分七厘、午市六錢三分六厘半、做出交易、早市一千角午市一千五百角、廣東小洋亦步下旋早市爲六錢○一厘半、午市爲六錢○○八毫七忽半、較前午驟跌二厘三毫七忽半、做出交易、早市十二萬角、午市七萬五千角、銅元又縮四千文、爲三百九十七千文、</p>
<p>銀欵進出昨日銀行收解情形已不逮前日星期一之繁、惟出欵頗有、故銀根頭襯充裕、華商收解票欵一百七八十萬、外商一百八十餘萬、特出欵一百五十餘萬、結欵一百餘萬、各種貨物·匯兌·關稅·押匯·什欵等收解八百七八十萬出倉一百十萬、日商銀行收解各欵四百七十餘萬、進倉五十萬、錢莊銀公單收解四千一百餘萬、劃頭欵收解二百八十餘萬、各路匯欵收解七十餘萬、收現五六十萬、</p>
<p>洋欵進出市塲中做出匯劃票欵、早市一百七十萬○五千、午市八十六萬七千、鈔票祗午市二萬、塲外做出鈔票早市十八萬五千、午市十七萬三千、現洋早市十四萬、午市二十一萬、中山新幣五萬、袁幣四萬銀行買賣、早市互市七十五萬、午市五十萬、外銀行買進三十餘萬、各銀行洋户往來收解一百四十餘萬、鈔票進出一百餘萬、客路來源四十餘萬、裝出汕厦·廣東·北路·内地·漢口各埠共計新幣現洋鈔票等三百四五十萬錢莊洋公單收解四百七八十萬、洋劃頭欵收解二百二十餘萬、拆借洋欵進出一百四十餘萬、小錢莊收兌鈔票、售出現洋新幣匯頭等交易五六十萬、</p>
<h3>袁幣加水又昂</h3>
<p>滬埠自改鑄中山新幣以來、袁幣現底以出品中輟、流出日繁致市上貨物甚少、查從前廣帮勇購時、加水曾到過六七八厘不等、旋以銷胃停頓、加水無形平奠、今年上半年、未聞有何種巨大加水、即有亦不過半厘或數毫而已、詎昨忽又有某處去路、購者甚殷、加水重又抬至二三厘、最高則抬至四厘半、如是照昨日市價則有七錢二分八厘有强、不可謂非無妄之激變也、</p>
<h3>證劵平交債市晨漲午回</h3>

<h3>債市殊鮮發展</h3>
<p>價亦稍降…進出不鉅</p>
<p>昨日公債現貨、依然寥落、前後市成交一萬一千八百包、期市亦略形平靜、賣買人氣渙散、蓋債市環象沉悶殊鮮新發展而交割期近、大户觀望、暫無鉅額之進出也、債價亦見滯定、全日僅半元許盤旋、其靜定狀况、爲近所未見、較前日善後六月期下降達一元三角、七年·善後現貨較上星期五漲高頗巨、其他大致趨疲、爲數祗四五角云、</p>

<h3>紗花紗市崩狀現矣</h3>
<p>日紗發見曾不數覯之低峯</p>
<p>多方消極商塲上空氣惡劣</p>
<p>紗市醖釀已久、業已發生極大變化、實受東洋三品紗慘落影響本埠買方均持乎金貴銀賤問題詎料三品紗猝跌人心大起恐怖、本月份曾見九十八元此種景象、爲歷來所罕見、然測其大勢情形、因銷路停滯底貨囤積約有三十萬包說據云三品紗價一時仍無辦法、於是買方鑒於環境惡劣祇得忍痛斬結、多頭方面、前後兩市售出一萬六千三百五十包惟恒大廠商獨家購進八千三百五十包、商塲上空氣異常緊張紗市照大勢論之、前途尚有劇烈之跌風也、</p>
<p>多方大吐特吐恒大吸力亦强人標前市開盤、因美棉又跌隔日人心虚弱達於極點、多頭均不限價賣出、各月均跌七八錢惟恒大廠商每盤購進二百五十包市價略定稍漲結果各漲一·二·三錢、恒大買進四千三百五十包達記進二千二百五十包賣出義成一千包、益昶一千一百五十包長豐一千零五十包天昌四千零五十包、利昌三千八百包、午後三品紗本月跌進一百元關内人心愈慌、各跌七八錢、但多頭依然大批了結恒大仍購進四千包申新進一千六百包達豐進一千三百五十包賣出利昌四千六百包義成一千八百包天隆一千零五十包、大昌成一千六百包、結果各跌三·四·五·六·八錢、全日成交統計四萬七千八百五十包兹將人標收盤價錄左</p>

<h3>棉市轉穩實需岑寂</h3>
<p>美棉來電仍跌本埠現棉銷路岑寂、實以底貨單薄漢帮逢跌仍有購意、散户視形勢堅硬、不敢貿然抛賣、故市氣比紗市略昂、惟是紗價不振世界棉業情形衰弱紗廠停工者日衆消費勢將减少、欲其上漲亦屬難能</p>
<p>漢標利昌我頭紛紛了結漢標前市開盤、市氣反堅、以賣户缺乏各月漲五分至二錢半惟利昌多頭了結不少、午後形勢尚昂、利昌又了結一萬零七百担、買進均爲散户、各月漲跌五分至一錢、全日成交統計五萬五千五百担兹將漢標收盤價錄左</p>

<h3>日紗運華銷售</h3>
<p>日本三品紗狂跌之原因、已略誌昨報、昨日三品紗又跌四元爲九十八元五角最低峯爲九十八元實爲大正三年十二月之八十六元來之新低價紗市在此情勢之下、除减少生産以免積存增加外、則如何使大量之存底減少實爲目前重要問題减少存底、貶價求售而外發展爲唯一之策略、故此次之狂跌、實爲意料之事也、運華銷售之說則已成事實矣、聞日商行購定五千包運滬、昨日開出之二十支寶來與三馬即爲日紗、價格旣廉而品質復優、銷售自易本紗受其壓迫、殊爲不可避免之事也、</p>
<h3>世界花紗漲跌逈異</h3>
<p>三品近期紗跌至九十八元五角</p>
<p>美棉跌勢未衰昨日美棉初因天氣良好、華爾街軟弱而疲、後因一部份空户抵補回堅、計期貨跌十四至二十二磅音、現貨跌二十磅音、英棉期貨跌二十至二十一點、現貨跌九點、埃及棉現貨跌二十點、印棉停市、原電錄左、（二十三日電）</p>

<h3>糧食粉市凌亂實力虚軟</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午各月份市面、大致呈混亂之象、初以洋麥報價又略疲小、廠家亦趁此機會、意欲壓短本月份則以實銷觀望、人心曾一度軟弱最低至二兩五錢二分二釐半、其餘各月、因浮多回出甚暢、又見大軟、七月份低至二兩五錢、八月份至五錢一分、九月份至五錢二分半、較前日均落二三分不等惟至下午二盤後、因内地帮鑒於産區麥價、未能十分鬆動粉價亦無過小之理因此買胃又健、市面亦復回振觀此後之局面、以實銷尚未開始活動本月份此種行情、當可盤旋過去也、結果本月份較前日小一分七釐半、七月份小七釐半、八九月份小五釐十月份未動、十一月份好五釐云、</p>
<h3>期現麥齊跌二三分</h3>
<p>昨日麥跌風、已轉平定、因無錫帮方面、始終以麥價關係、未看小面、雖如漢口江北等帮、空出仍多、但因一種之濳勢力、尚未完全打消、故上午曾較前日回好三四分、迨至下午各盤、則以粉市仍疲、人心復下、各盤開價、亦見盤落、結果六十一月份較前日各小二分、七月份小一分、八九十月份小三分、現麥因廠家大致提高殺次、未肯貪進、各檔較前日小二三分、開沙市·高郵·紹臖·揚州·雙鳳·蓬萊·太倉·浦東·及陳東麥共二萬包、由各廠辦去半數云、</p>
<h3>洋米將有大批抵埠</h3>
<p>已開路貨兩萬餘包</p>
<p>昨日洋米現銷略淡、統市祇開萬包左右、由甬温本街内地等辦去、惟路貨交易甚佳貨主旣願脫手、進户胃口亦香、數比現貨加倍以上、行情則均平平、因目下存底旣足乃月内及二三天到埠者數有二十餘萬、人心不免帶軟路貨開出小絞糙一萬五千包、價十五元半、又大絞五千包、價十六元四五角、安南粳亦有千餘包因本街歡迎價至十九元、現貨係大小絞及糙米等、價均比前市略軟云</p>
<h3>米市交易沉靜</h3>
<p>閘北昨河下到船十餘號、北粳交易依然停頓、社會局登記後各貨客、仍不願出售、而本街店方臨市人數頗多、因當局嚴限、亟欲遵限暢進、奈賣方不售、致仍停交、羊杜尖交易寂寞、祇變元微有成交、然特頂元已達念元零五角、普通元二十元矣、</p>
<p>滬南河下到貨依然極微、市胃雖佳、然仍無貨、間有中次粳米上市、因數寥寥、行情異常居奇、薄稻亦告缺、尖米雖少亦俏、杜子大盤在二十元以上、通變漲勢轉定、成交不多、高貨開二十元左右、</p>
<h3>標準荳餅二兩出關</h3>
<p>交易所將增加證金</p>
<p>昨日期餅初因一部份囤户多頭出售了結、見小一分半之譜下午連電報緊、鄕胃轉濃、情勢回上、近期開一兩九錢九分遠期仍爲二兩○一分、交易所因荳餅盤而到此頂峯地位、認爲有增加證金之必要故已公告、如餅價拍至二兩○五分以上、每千片證金規定二百兩按二兩外之價格實爲歷年所未有者</p>
<h3>絲茶歐美絲市仍無轉機</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、仍無轉機、查外滙不堅、海外絲電仍鮮見轉、華商絲本不鬆、歐美來價仍低、勢難虧本求售、昨市祇有補空交易、計乾利等進新廠經二十包、中和等進白乾經十五包、價仍平定云、</p>
<h3>平水大帮已開盤</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、湖州·平水大帮已由錦隆洋行開盤、售價自四十五兩二錢半至四十六兩二錢半、較上年無甚高下、惟美莊本年對於大帮選擇綦嚴、蓋恐有粉色攙人其間將來銷路未能見大、路莊珍眉、高莊暢銷、中低莊呆滯、昨市婺源北鄕貨續有到滬、今日當可見樣、祁門紅茶興成天祥等行、略有進胃、但售盤又較前見低四五兩云</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂糖回跌一錢</h3>
<p>昨日古巴現糖貨爲一·二五、紐約九月份價一·三四十二月份一·四四、三月份一·五三、五月份一·六○各跌四分爪哇期現糖價均無升降、公會粗砂白買氣殊寥、出户轉衆、市形突露頽象、成交價跌至七兩九比前回跌一錢、中砂白市亦跟落、惟少成交日糖ＹＰ嘜八兩五錢半、ＹＴ嘜八兩三錢半、市亦平疲ＹＲＯ嘜以貨缺需暢、成交價八兩二錢、明治貨八兩二錢半、尚覺俏秀太古糖雖有漲價之說、一時難成事實、號盤有國貨棉湖赤開出數十包、價七兩七錢半、頗合杭莊銷路半南青開百餘包價至五兩九、市且不弱古巴洋自開價七兩一錢後、昨又漲二錢禎祥號售出一千袋價七兩三錢、係北路需要、而市氣以價格過昂、平疲不奇云、</p>
<h3>五金英馬口鐵飛黃騰達</h3>
<p>英馬口鐵新近趨勢、十分良佳雖到源頻頻、但出口甚踴躍、而本街點綴亦廣、因此無存豐之苦、但近來異軍突起之顔料帮、紛起收辦、故成交甚爲衆多、行情因環境所趨、大有飛黃騰達之勢、計九十磅每箱估十四兩、一百磅估十五兩、而交易尤以九十磅爲興奮云、</p>

<p>這幾天的報上、我們可以發見一個特約似的消息、這便是各學校的畢業典禮、我們校裏在着前幾天也舉行過了、各科畢業的同學、共有四十多人、在着游藝會後我們幾個未畢業的同學、邀了平日相知的一部分畢業同學開了一個小小的歡送會、朝夕相處驪歌遽唱、誠有「一聲河滿子、雙涙落君前」的情懷、相顧黯然者多時、繼着討論到出路問題、「我說」、一位畢業同學似乎帶些感慨站了起來、「不是風凉話、眞的、還是你們未畢業的好、在我從前也曾這樣想、畢業是最愉快、但現在却以爲最苦悶的了、」他透了一口氣、接着、「因爲、在没有畢業、還可以安心的讀下去、現在旣畢了業、到國外去留學、没有錢、在家庭的期望、以爲大學畢了業好比前清中了狀元、從此可以陞官發財的、而在事實上現在便連一個敎員位置都不容易找前途眞是渺茫得很、你說是愉快還是苦悶呢、」據我所知道的這一次畢業的同學、其中還不到十個是已找到了職業的而這職業多半是用非所學、我們校裏有的是文科法科理科和敎育科、這一次畢業的敎育科較多、法科文科次之理科最少、現在大半都在一樣地苦悶在我們同房問的趙他是安徽人、也是這一次畢業的、在這半個月來我們看他簡直像發了狂一般、總日除了寫信、便是拜客、但是、雖然寫出去的信多半是用掛號寄的、有回信的却也很少、拜客去時、總是興高采烈的、頭髮和西裝一定要弄個半天、務使光滑平直、然後笑嘻嘻的對我們「暫别」、揚長去了、但是等到回來、却一聲不鄕地把西裝隨手亂丢、躺　床上、「老趙、怎麽、」有時我們問他、然而他竟把頭埋進被裏嘆息起來了、「這大約是托人謀事碰了頂子罷、至少没有結果、」我們這樣竊竊私議着、但是這還算是好的了、他還有朋友可以寫信有大小的人物可以去拜、雖然是没有成功至於像我那個同鄕湖南人小陳、丨也是這屆畢業的丨他却没有一個好親好友、一籌莫展地終日只是枯坐在房裏嘆氣、「老張、這次我總得回家去吃老米飯了、」一天、他悲傷地向着我說、「但是有什麽面目呢、而且湖南現在是個兵和匪的世界」我却也被他打動了心、禁不住要流下涙來、因爲一方面、我那同鄕的確是可憐、而主要却是在爲自已感傷、因爲我也快畢業了、而畢業的結果、看來也只是這樣同時更推想這一屆畢業的、在我們校裏只是這些而綜會全上海各校、就有不少的人、這不少的人、能有幾我是「天之驕子」而被選擇去呢、我想大多數的人是要嘗失業的痛苦罷、而我們許多還懷着金色的好夢的未畢業同學、不久也會不可抵抗地接受這個同樣的命運、我們的求學是掙扎得來的、有不少是嘗過了失學的痛苦、但是、現在嘗過了失學的痛苦、還要再嘗失業的痛苦而安知通過了失業的痛苦、還有其他的痛苦在等候着呢、啊啊、我眞不願再想下去了、然而、現在這畢業同學的出路、却始終是成爲問題而值得討論的、</p>
<p>我們知道、失業的恐慌、已成了近代的一個普遍的危險症候、而在弱小民族的中國、則爲尤甚、這自然是因爲民族受了資本帝國主義的壓迫、弄得政治不上軌道、經濟不能發達的緣故、尤在今日、全國兵連禍結、羣盜如毛、水旱天災、疫癘飢饉、幾乎遍地皆是、工商事業、一任帝國主義宰割、如最近金貴銀賤、所受損失、尤爲從來所未有、在國家不得已而施行緊縮政策的這種情形之下、畢業生的出路、自然是不易解决的問題、不過、我們覺得青年是社會的中堅、受過大學敎育的青年、尤多優秀分子、設若始養終棄、聽其由失望而消沉而墜落、甚或挺而走險、則非特斵傷了民族的元氣、抑且是社會絶大的弊害、因此、在目前、我們有要求社會有着相當的安揷的必要、而使「人盡其才」、來發展社會、同時、我們每一個青年、也應該明白我們中國、陷入次殖民地地位由來已久、現在一切的紛亂·都是民族尚未完全獨立所致、現在我們要想解决一切的問題、尤其是自身的出路問題、必須堅决地把握了民族的意識、爲一切思想和行動的中心、來向前努力、然後才有眞正的出路、如果不這樣、單憑着一些感情的衝動、浮躁地爲了没有出路而自毁毁人、這始終是無補於事、而且、損害了民族的元氣、</p>
<p>又據近日報載、我國留日學生、因受金貴銀賤影響、不能維持、紛紛回國的有五百餘人、這五百餘人、現在自然同樣地發生了出路問題、因此、我們覺得、我們所討論的問題、是十分地嚴重和需要、我們對於這個問題的態度、在目前、是要求社會予以相當的救濟、而根本、却在我們青年急切地有民族的覺醒、而且把握這個武器、英勇地向侵害我們民族獨立的一切環境奮關、青年的同學們、畢業的同學們、留日被迫回國的同學們、認清你們眞正的出路罷、「大庇天下寒士盡歡顔」的「廣夏千萬間」是在自已努力建設啊、（賢）</p>

<h3>世界文學的故事（一七一）美國翰瑪西著胡仲持譯</h3>
<p>第四十四章近代西班牙文學</p>
<p>較佩累達及發利拉年青、而立於指導許多更年青的西班牙人的地位的是迦爾陀斯他顯示着到現代小說的過渡期然而因爲無論什麽人、即使但丁及哥德罷、都没有開始或者閉止什麽文學運動、所以凡有才能的人物都是一個過渡期、這與其說是過渡、毋寗說是推移、迦爾陀斯找求他的主材於十九世紀的歷史、而以連串的小說作成一種叙事詩、「國民揷話、」那制限是在叙事詩底性質、雖是良好的羅曼底小說材料、總不像現實的材料似的這一點、這依然是鄕村的西班牙風丨丨當全歐羅巴被包含在内時候、然而在那里、在恰當地他所稱爲「揷話」的東西那里、却有着優美的故事、而且他是有性格描寫的天禀的、在他的歷史故事以外用了不少的主材他寫出很多的小說來、他還被和巴爾扎克及迭更司相比較、這是因爲他所描寫的人們、和他的關於故事的知識和他的諧謔有多種多樣的緣故、</p>
<p>屬於前世紀的後半的跋爾台斯、是受到一種非難的、就是他受法蘭西人的影響太過了、文學的内面底影響是好的東西、不是對於國民底權利的侵害、大作家常常是巧妙的偷兒、跋爾台斯本能上是優良的藝術家、較之大概缺乏法蘭西的精確和匀整的多數的西班牙作家、他對於法蘭西的小說有着密接的關係、他的「泡沬」和「信仰」是有精美的冷嘲的調子的近代生活的寫實底研究、</p>
<p>公平地可稱爲西班牙的喬治桑的天才底婦人是伊彌利亞·帕多·巴冉以對於本國和國人的熱誠而言、她是類似着她的法蘭西的姊妹的、在「關於我國」之中、她以生動光輝的塲景的知識丨塲景是西北部西班牙丨和對於往往在自身没有魔力的人物的觀察底的同情寫着、在這小說及例如「爲母的自然」似的别的小說中、她在所謂自然主義者之羣中、佔着她的地位、我没有見到這些小說譯成英語、然而有所大約已經譯出了罷因爲在英吉利及亞美利加的作家及出版者丨這就是讀者之謂丨丨之間、對於西班牙的小說的興味是逐漸增大起來了、</p>
<p>小說、或者任何形式的故事、是在自國的天空下以外别國的天空之下、極容易馴服的文學的式型、而最容易譯出的自然是散文故事、十九世紀的西班牙的詩在西班牙以外的國没有給與多大的印象、倒反而是處於外國人的影響之下、同世紀前半的青年詩人厄斯普綸退達、正如大陸歐羅巴的許多青年詩人似的、是擺侖的弟子、他是傲岸的冒險的革命主義者、捲入於當時一切政治底及好戰底動亂之中、自然就傾向於擺侖了、他是天生的詩人他那許多的活動不過單是火似的勇敢傲岸的性質的一部分、那别一面發着錚錚淙淙的聲音流貫於他的詩中、凡這些是西班牙詩的親切的讀者都所證言的、</p>
<p>在同世紀的中葉、似乎給了大大的印象於西班牙、且越了山嶺恐怕還過了海（所以說是海者因爲西班牙的世界的大部分並不住於西班牙之中）的詩人是卡謨頗麥他正如許多世紀以來的詩人們那樣、十分單純地、是象徵主義者、他以反復了幾度的一種短詩、丨丨他給那種詩以批評底名稱、那名稱没有較之短詩呀·頌詩呀·民謡呀這一種名稱、更足以助我們領略本質底材料丨丨歌着國民的思想和永遠的思想之間有關係所事、我將這個見解留給讀者和比我更高明的西班牙語的讀者罷、卡謨頗麥乃是賀拉西、奥維特和裕惠奈爾的讀者、我没有見到這個詩人所英譯、然而散亂的斷片經後代的英吉利詩人譯出的大概也有的罷、爲什麽呢、因爲正如上面說過、在用英語的國民之間、對於西班牙文學的興味是漸次增加起來了、</p>

<h3>孟加拉民間故事卓</h3>
<p>戴伯訶利著許地山譯</p>
<p>商務書館出版</p>
<p>許地山譯筆的流利暢達、早已馳名文藝界了、記得我最初認識許君的譯筆、係在從前的北京晨報底附鐫和上海的小說月報、許君在那兩種刋物上所餽餉於我們的可以說是很不少了、</p>
<p>許君譯的戴伯訶利（ＬalBehariDay）底孟加拉民間故事（ＦolkTalesofBenga）、又整個地餽餉於我們了、它在這部孟加拉民間故事的譯筆怎麽樣、我這裏也毋庸辭費了吧、</p>
<p>他譯的這部孟加拉民間故事集、是一九一二年的麥美倫公司出版底本子、據它的譯叙上說、「我並没有逐字逐句直譯、只把各故事底意思率直地寫出來、至於原文的辭句、在譯文中時有增减、因爲繙譯民間故事只求其内容明瞭就可以、不必如其餘文章要逐字斟酌、」</p>
<p>誠然、繙譯民間故事只須求其内容明瞭就可以、不過求其内容明瞭、就是一椿不輕容易的工作、有些人在繙譯上喜歡運用艱澀晦暗的筆法及其詞句以炫惑讀者、其實、這又何苦來、據譯叙上說、</p>
<p>「我譯述這二十二段故事的動機、一來是因爲我對於民俗學底研究很有興趣、每覺得中國有許多民間故事、係從印度輾轉流入底多譯些印度的故事、對於研究中國民俗學必定很有帮助、二來因爲今年春間芝子問我要小說看、我自已許久没動筆了、一時也寫不了許多、不如就用兩三個月功夫譯述一二十段故事來給她看、更能使她滿足、」</p>
<p>我們看了上面一大段說話、可以知道他譯這部孟加拉民間故事的動機是有兩個、其中一個動機、我們可以置之不論、可是其他的一個動機、很能夠敎我們低敬他的毅力和精神哩、</p>
<p>不錯、研究民俗學的人們、不象研究别樣學問的人容易惹人注目、殊不知如民間故事等等、都是人類對於推理記憶想像等最早的奮勉、和别樣學問乃有同等的重要、而且、民間故事是民俗學底重要的研究材料、</p>
<p>這部孟加拉民間故事、包含着二十二段故事、它的節目、就是（一）死新郎、（一）驪龍珠、（一）三寶罐、（一）羅刹國、（一）絞人涙、（一）吉祥子、（一）七母子、（一）寶扇緣、（一）阿芙蓉、（一）三王子、（一）二竊賊、（一）鬼夫、（一）荒林乞士（一）鬼妻、（一）鬼友、（一）綠珠、（一）紅寶石、（一）豺媒、（一）新月王子、（一）鬼役、（一）骨原、（一）秃妻、</p>
<p>固然、孟加拉的民間故事、斷斷乎不止這麽二十二段、那末、這二十二段雖然都是孟加拉的民間故事、恐怕不免要掛一漏萬了罷、對於這一點、却不必我來替它解釋了、據譯叙上說、</p>
<p>「據著者、很可以代表孟加拉村中底老婆子對孩子們所講底故事、」</p>
<p>當然、在這二十二段的故事裏、一篇有一篇的特質、惟據譯叙上說、「除了二竊賊及阿芙蓉以外、多半的結局是團圓的美滿的、」</p>
<p>結局是團圓而美滿的故事、確乎比較非團圓的非美滿的要容易流傳和存在、因爲美滿而有團圓的故事、易招大衆的歡迎、</p>
<p>末了、還有一點值得我們注意的、就是孟加拉講民間故事的老婆子講完一段故事後、必須念出一段莫明其所以然的小歌曲、在這部戴伯訶利的孟加拉民間故事裏雖然僅有二十二段、而那種小歌曲、所以就有二十二次的發現、那種小歌曲的辭句、極爲奇特、譯者說是這一段無意義的言詞、爲底是便聽底孩子們感到一點興趣、這裏且將那莫明其所以然的歌曲的辭句、錄之於左、</p>
<p>我底故事說到這裏算定了、</p>
<p>那提耶棘也枯萎了、</p>
<p>那提耶呵、你爲什麽枯萎呢、</p>
<p>你底牛爲什麽要我用草來餒它、</p>
<p>牛呵、你爲什麽要人牧、</p>
<p>你底牧者爲什麽不看護我、</p>
<p>牧者呵、你爲什麽不去看牛、</p>
<p>你的兒媳婦爲什麽不把米給我、</p>
<p>兒媳婦呵、你爲什麽不給米呢、</p>
<p>我底孩子爲什麽哭呢、</p>
<p>孩子呵、你爲什麽哭呢、</p>
<p>螞蟻爲什麽要咬我呢</p>
<p>螞蟻呵、你爲什麽要咬人呢、</p>
<p>喀喀喀、</p>

<p>汽車新聞</p>
<p>專論</p>
<h3>汽車與汽油之關係ＫＨ</h3>
<p>汽油爲汽車界之主要要素。蓋不容疑者。其生産其購買所費之鉅。遠出機械車輛方面其他各物之上者不知若干倍。設無汽油世界交通全部將立見阻斷。汽車而無汽油其能否得有今日亦一大疑問也。吾嘗思之。當ＧotlibeDaimlerOtto與其時人創造汽車之時。設無汽油可得。不知其將循何途徑以進展。其勢今日必將有蒸汽車及某種電車通行街道。而就機械與科學之在在能適應時需亟謀進步而觀之。則此類車輛。亦未始不能臻於安適。可靠與迅速之塊也。</p>
<p>或有的狀况</p>
<p>但我所注意者。設創造者不得已而採用汽油以外之燃料則内部燃燒亦即爆發原動機之最終演變。應爲何如。須知吾人現正論及之原動機。其動力原靠着汽缸中燃料之燃燒。其全部原理。蓋脫體自大原動機之原以用在靜止的方面。係由德人Ｏffo所發明。而用尋常之煤氣以開動者。然則吾人固未嘗不可得一種車輛。藉一種氣體以行駛。氣受高大之壓縮力。貯藏在强固之鋼箱中。足能供給相當之動力與速力乎。抑或將有才能傑出之士。發明一種經濟的酒精原動機發動極易。而絶無其他缺點。以致如今日之因之見擯不用乎。</p>
<p>汽油之優劣</p>
<p>煤中取出的盆純混合液。或已能解决此問題。但能否採掘足量之煤。以供美國一國之需。遑論全世界。是亦一大疑問也。即謂能之。欲使純粹的盆純。不與汽車冲淡。而能獲得清潔。開車便易。及良好加速等美點。使不致如今日之見棄。亦一大難事也。</p>
<p>幸汽油自昔爲量頗富。至今猶儘夠吾人取用。無不繼之虞。亦自不必以苦無相當替代爲慮也。</p>
<p>雖然。吾終不明普通使用汽車者對於汽油。具有何種思想。其僅以汽油視汽油乎。抑亦察其成分之優劣。而知燃料之於原動機正猶稻草之於馬乎。</p>
<p>在討論好汽油之要素以前。吾願將原動機的汽缸之内部動作。先爲揭開面目。呈露眼前。吾願先問其中發生何種動作。如何這種動作能應合并力而與吾人以最美滿之結果。所謂最美滿之結果。就現行汽車之特點。約舉其要。不外開車便利。平穩與迅速之原動力而已。</p>
<p>汽油如何開車</p>
<p>汽油發動機是一種熱力發動機。其動作規仿小孩玩具中常見之舊式熱空氣原動機之原理。空氣受熱則漲。緊閉而燃燒之。可利用膨漲空氣之壓力以推動他物。此正汽油在汽缸中燃燒爆發之動作也。多量的空氣。帶着小量的汽油蒸發汽。引入汽缸。在適宜的時候。發電火以燃燒油之汽體。結果。熱力産生。空氣膨漲。至於</p>
<h3>波斯王之御用車（紀事見上期本刋）</h3>
<h2>Page 29</h2>
<p>相當點度。推動活塞。而原動衝程行矣。凡此種種似非常簡單。當各項必要條件一一履行。而機件動作平穩之時。固甚簡單。但若遇原動機之打樣師與汽油公司不能相爲應合。則動作不調隨之矣。</p>
<p>旣知動力靠着空氣之膨漲。而此膨漲發生於一極小的空間。且因原動機之體積與重量往往使打樣帥受極嚴之限制。故膨漲又僅能伸展於一極端有限的範圍以内。故此膨漲當活塞下降之際。務必使之力大而持久。</p>
<p>以此爲目的。則當活塞下降達於極點之時。空氣與汽油的混合汽必須儘量加入汽缸。而欲得最高度之膨漲。此混合汽在燃燒以前。必須儘力加以壓縮。壓縮由上升之活塞實行之。</p>
<p>有人以爲每盎司的膨漲力都能用於推動活塞下行。這亦未嘗不言之有理。但事實上却不然第一因原動機之衝程。其長度足能使混合汽完全膨漲者。則原動機之體積從未有能狹小至於能裝置在汽車中者。第二因後部之膨漲。往往無足量之原力。足供使用。</p>
<p>後部原力所以不足之原因。最要者厥爲熱力之易於消失。實際上燃燒一加侖汽油。其熱力能發生五十七匹馬力的動力。而現行的精良之原動機。僅能發生動力約十四匹馬力而已。（未完）</p>

<h3>飛霞公共汽車問世</h3>
<p>黃影呆</p>
<p>經二年之研究始克告成</p>
<p>飛霞汽車廠之五一四新車。問世未久。而最近復有六輪六汽缸公共汽車之出品。成績之優。得未曾有。最近曾一度陳列於米蘭意大利分廠。公開展覽。如以目前意大利各地之交通事業而言。則一如歐洲各國無異。舉凡熱閙之城市。均用公共汽車。往行駛。以代電車。其中尤以意大利京城羅馬爲甚。蓋目前羅馬城中。熱閙之處。除公共汽車而外。電車不准行駛也。他若米蘭。法勞倫斯。納潑勒斯各地之中心區域。亦採用同樣之政策惟不及羅馬之專制耳。新式飛霞公共汽車。爲六四○號。即在意大利製造。自飛霞有歷史以來。其在意大利製造公共汽車。實係首開紀錄。且此種新車載重之力。頗爲濃厚。用雙套甲板。能容八十二人。底盤則僅有一種。而車身之式樣。則多至三種。其中單套甲板。所有車身。其周圍之長度。爲二十三呎六吋乘七呎六吋。高度則六呎十吋。有座位凡三十。而所留空地。亦可立搭客三十人。駕機及賣票之人。均另有地位。雙套甲板者。内部之長度爲二十三呎五吋乘七呎五吋。高度六呎三吋。下層可容坐客三十一人。立者二十三人。上層可容二十八人。能容八十二人之公共汽車。蓋亦爲最新之出品。而爲我大所未之聞者也。</p>
<p>六汽缸之引擎裝置於車轎之前部。駕駛</p>
<p>人手室之下而駕駛之人。則坐於左方。凡駕車之人。一經試車。即知新車各部。統馭易如一無困難之發生。而新車之成績。得以有若是其優良者。蓋製造之時。工程方面。經二年之研究。始告成功。而此次始得問世。意大利各地。如用此種公共汽車。則行駛於道路之上。在任何環境之下。完全無窒碍發生。在種種優點之中。尤以措置之易如。機件之可靠。動作之敏捷。爲最足令人注意者也。此種引擎。爲六汽缸而周圍則一○五乘一三五ＭＭ口徑及行程。則爲７０１４cc·。所有汽缸。連絡一處。裝置於一室。頭部分離。汽塞則另置一邊。曲柄棍有軸承凡九。引擎雖在最低之速率。可轉二·二○○轉。而馬力最速之時。可達九十匹。爲求可靠起見。發火亦用雙套。火花塞二枚。裝置於汽缸之上。作傾斜之狀。前部有一横柄。統馭抽水之機。而一端則與磁石互相銜接。在後部之汽缸板上。有高大之漲力。分配各部。並由電池之傳遞。輸入底盤。引擎之左手方面。則有一可拆卸之水套。以司清潔汽缸之用。爲免於有窒碍發生起見。故汽缸桶四周。水量之分配。亦頗均匀。减熱裝置。亦可隨意分離。而冷水系統。則曲柄棍之上。裝有風扇繫有兩繩。不斷工作。</p>
<p>如以催滑作用而言。因受壓力之支配。能使四加倫之滑油。灌注各部。而曲柄箱則一如前輪軸之軌道。有抽油器。一則掃除油漬。一則將滑油分配。受壓力作用。而傳傳於主要及次要之聯桿軸承。且後部之汽缸。有一力量濃之濾油器。而所有滑油。均須過此器并。排氣及進氣。在引擎之右方。而進氣管則裝有發熱之點。簡單之沙立克斯Ｓolex化油氣。與之互相連接。而燃料則自四十四加倫之盛油箱。輸入化油器之中。發電之力量。濃大無比。而引擎之上。又有電力發動機凡二。裝置於齧拿之左右。在齒輪圈及飛輪之上。同時工作。引擎之上。各種附件之中。最足令人注意者。乃爲空氣喞筒。以司開關汽車之門。完全由空氣作用。且可使車胎之膨脹。所蓄燃料。其使引擎之動作。而牽及車架也。便利異常。與齒輪盒分離。然與齧合子室。則相互接合。引擎則接合之處。其有三點。有輪轉機凡二。即在曲柄箱之後。待與齒輪盒分離後。或各部不相接合之時。則可使轉動。引擎之中。汽缸之上。且有無數巨大之鍵帶。前面之一根。可使引擎推進而向前。互相勾牽。而前面之滑車。與後面互相接合。可使脫離底盤。據云在二小時内可能換一引擎。其神速實無比也。</p>
<p>底盤之骨架。頗爲高大。共分三道。跨越各部。及直徑巨大之管凡四。而最足重要者。即後輪軸之中也。四部分速之齒輪盒。裝於副架之上。而與引擎則完全脫離。齒輪盒之後。有一短棍。連接之處凡二。而一端爲制輪鼓也。此處推動推進棍。則可由萬向接頭。與後輪軸發生關係。輪軸之中。各有不同。即後輪軸亦然。而動作之靈活。則允推上乘也。彈簧之裝置於前部者。則爲橢圓形。而後部亦有半橢圓式者兩對。内部制輪。因脚踏板之上。動作靈便。塞車易如。在速率緩慢。裝以貨物。每小時行路二十二哩之時。則可用手動制輪。而所用車胎。則爲鄧綠普３８by９時者。車輪完全以鋼骨製成。速率方面。最速之時。亦分兩等。一則每小時二十八哩。一則每小時二十四又四分之一哩。車身亦均以金屬製成。以適合　於意大利之用。乃爲主要問題。居中有門口凡二。而同樣之門口在前面者。亦有二處。門之開閉。完全由由空氣作用。故當公共汽車在行駛之時。搭客實無法上下也。</p>
<h3>去前年之美國汽車比較偉業</h3>
<p>美利堅爲世界最富之國。汽車出産之多。需用之廣。儼如吾人之布帛菽粟。取用不竭。爲人生不可須臾或離之日用品、其産額與銷路之趨勢。無不與年俱增。試以去歲之狀况。與前年一比較之。即可徵信矣。據美國全國汽車商會會長黎佛士之統計。一九二九年全國出産各項汽車。達五、六五一、○○○輛、總售價爲三、四八三、九○○、○○○元、其在一九二八年。則出産額爲四、六○一、一三○輛。售價計三、一六二、七九八、八八○元。産額激增約百分之二十三。</p>
<p>全世界汽車註册數量。截至一九二九年年終止。計達三四、七○○、○○○輛。其中有二六、四○○、○○○輛。乃在美國註册者。佔全數百分之七十六。而在一九二八年。則全球註册之數爲三一、七七八、二○三輛、註册於美國者有二四、四九三、一二四輛。</p>
<p>去歲農業上使用之汽車。註册達五百五十萬輛。按統計美國約有農民六百萬。平均每人有車一輛。」新車産銷之記錄外。尚有汽車零件附件以及業務上所用之器具。去年亦佔優勢。總售價爲九二○·○○○·○○○元。橡皮輪胎之用於新舊　換者值價六○○·○○○·○○○元。去歲汽車界所納之汽車稅爲九二五、○○○、○○○元。其中所含之汽油稅。佔四一五、○○○、○○○元。前年則爲八○七、八八七、九六七元。汽油稅佔三○四、八七一、七六六元。</p>
<p>一九二九年美産汽車輸出國外者。有一、○一五、○○○輛。售價包括汽車零件及輪胎。共計七五七、四○○、○○○元。輸入美境者僅七百一十輛。一九二八年之輸出額。連美製零件裝配成車者。共計八二五、一一三輛。售價連零件及輪胎在内。爲五七八、五六五、二四九元。</p>
<p>去年汽車工業及民衆所用之汽油。共計二九七、○○○、○○○桶。</p>
<p>全國已經改良完成之汽車道路。載至去年終。計長六十六萬英里。總計各種道路共長三百零一萬六千二百八十一英里。全國服務於汽車工業上之職工。共計四百三十四萬一千人。經售商計五萬二千家。</p>
<h3>派卡又造成新紀錄曲紫</h3>
<p>美國奥海塢省愛克倫城。有某大車胎廠。近報告該廠派卡八汽缸車又造成新紀錄經過情形。據云。該廠自購置派卡爲試胎車之日起。八個月内。除去星期日及休假外。曾用派卡繼續駛行一九四天。共行一</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>四八·四○○英里。平均每日行七六四·九英里。</p>
<p>此項試胎車。每天須行二十四小時。由駕駛員三人。輪流駕駛。每八小時一次。車上堆置沙袋。其載重較乘客七人。有過之無不及。至所經道路之險惡。尤爲必須條件之一。</p>
<p>經此新紀錄表演後。派卡愛克倫汽車公司。當即出而檢騐。但見機件完好。並無修理之必要。衆皆嘆服。據統計告人。平均我人自用汽車。每年約行一○、○○○英里。但派卡在八個月内行程。竟超過平均汽車十四年之行程。其機器之堅固爲何如耶。</p>
<h3>品高價低之第沙多曲紫</h3>
<p>廠家能造低價車。不足爲奇。欲得主顧之信任。尤當同時講究品質。如發動便利。動作穩靜。以及駕駛員乘客兩方面分認之種種特色。皆汽車廠家所宜注意之問題也。</p>
<p>社會所望于汽車廠者。一曰價錢巧。二曰貨色好。故廠家僅以低價汽車向世。不過適應需要之一半而已。必也價格减低。而品質無損。斯爲貴耳。換言之即此項汽車務必以品質爲標準。切不可以定價减低而出品退化也。</p>
<p>第沙多直綫八汽缸車。人皆知爲世界最低價之八汽缸車。同時亦已證明爲汽車市塲上工程最精優之汽車。例如下注化油制。採用最早。其工程原理。係利用地心吸力。送氣入汽缸。故在交換齡輪及加速時。效用大有進步。至其底盤及車身之構造。係用整塊鋼板。堅固無匹。而行時穩靜無聲。尤爲他車所罕見者也。</p>
<p>消息</p>
<h3>浙建廳</h3>
<p>第一期公路預算悟非</p>
<p>自民國十八年度起至二十二年度止浙江省建設廳。第一期各項建設計劃及預算。自民國十八年度起至二十二年度止。分類進行。至爲周密。其中關於公路事項。據言浙省省辦公路截至十八年度第六個月止。已通車者爲杭紹。節奉。杭長三路。不及二百七十公里。但按照現在計劃。十八年度下半年加入杭平杭昌各路。至十九年度通車里數可增至六百公里。十九年度爲路政工程猛進時期。預計至二十年度通車里數可增至一千一百公里。但此時車輛亟須增加。路面亦宜改良。故二十年度經費不能多用以發展路線。自二十一年度以後。逐年積極興築。至二十二年度終了時。全省公路營業里數可達一千三百餘公里。各路工程。因限於經費。擬定計劃。分年進行。每年支出工程經費。約需銀二百數十萬元。至路面舖設。凡在運輸尚求十分稠密之路。第一年可先用次等村料。待至次至營業進展。車輛增多。再逐漸改用上等石子路面。因之其路面工程經費有列入次年度預算中者。路線旣逐年加長。營業漸次發達。其收入亦以之遞增。預計十年度之營業收入爲八十三萬七千元。至二十二年度可增至四百八十二萬四千元。惟舊時應有充分車輛。以供營業上之需要。在十八年度開始時。所有載客車輛約有九十五輛。預計每年添置百數十輛。至二十二年度車輛總數至少可有六百輛。但每車假定祇能延用四年。則十八年度所添之車輛至二十二度。即須廢棄金購。實際上除因營業發展而添置之車輛外。又須爲購較車。以抵補廢棄舊車。因之需費加鉅。爲使易於舉辦起見。用折舊法。於每年營業盈餘項下。酌扣成數。有儲生息。專辦換購新車之用。此外尚有汽車修理。橋樑換新。橋樑修理。路綫改良。車站設備改良。以及械工年終奬勵金等項。故應於營業盈存項下。酌留成數。俾欵項有著事業得以遂漸發展。收用土地。若每公里平均按二十五畝計算。則截至二十二年度終</p>
<p>了時。共收用三萬七千畝。每畝平均以五十元計。共積欠地價一百八十餘萬元。以後每年築路三百公里。須收買地畝五千畝。合地價二十五萬元。若於每年營業盈餘項下。扣留百分之八。儲備供還地價之用。再發行公路用地無息庫劵二百五十萬元。則七年半之内當可一律還清兹爲便利計算營業盈餘起見。假定各項分配成後。（甲）收入一○○·○○百分率。（乙）支出。一、營業支出平均六五·○○百分率。二、汽車修理及折舊六·○○百分率。三、工程修理及改良四·○○百分率。四、職工奬勵金二·○○百分率。五、地價抽還八·○○百分率。（丙）盈餘營業凈盈餘一五·百分率。根據此項算法之成數。以支配每年之營業收入。則每年營業凈盈餘可供建設公路之用。計十八年度凈盈餘僅十二萬元。至二十二年度約可增至七十三萬元。而事業經費之取諸省庫者。亦可逐年减少云云。此其五年中之進行預算大較也。</p>

<h3>汽車深入蠻地趣聞徐美烈</h3>
<p>今人之稍具常識者固莫不知汽車爲近世陸地交通之唯一利器。而不知其除任重致遠。神速耐久之功用外。尚有克敵制勝。脫險禦侮之功能。此非過譽之辭。觀於司蒂倍克車最近在非洲所建之新猷。即足徵信。而其事亦甚趣也。緣有工作於冷波河南岸之美國採礦工程隊。現因奉命考察新金鋼鑽石礦區。特乘汽車深入白克堤國腹地。是處爲中阿非利加洲蠻民繁殖之區。純然化外。險惡異常。隊員未至其地之先。已知蠻民行同猛獸。性嗜殺人。欲覓一土著爲響導。而不可得。惴惴然惟恐竟飽蠻人之口腹。然以工作重要。明知險阻當前。亦只得毅然出發。不計其他。於以見美人勇敢冒險之精神。所用之車。爲一司蒂倍克舊車。已經過三萬英里之路程。由冷波河前往。無路可通。沿岸皆茂林叢莽。人跡罕見。或高崗峻嶺。崎嶇難陟。行駛竟日。經過五十英里之後。始覺漸有途徑可循。次日抵白克堤國。一行人咸小心翼翼。愼重前進。以防蠻人來侵。蓋此地蠻民之兇猛殘酷。直無絲毫人類所具之天性。往往一遇外族之人。即屠殺之。鮮有聽其生還者。方惶惑間。蠻人已數數出現。正欲設法避之。詎知若輩睹此活動自行之汽車。驚爲絶世稀有之怪物。平日勇於應敵之特性。竟一變而爲恐懼馴良之態度。其意殆不知來者果爲何物。是何如人。咸疑必乃天神下降。驅此兇猛無敵之怪獸前來獵捕彼輩者。因此竟悄然濳伏叢林間。震懾不敢動。約歷時許。羣見來者尚無惡意。乃敢趦趄緩進。圍向車旁。一探究竟。繼見乘者一方手持防身武器。一方注水於散熱器。加汽油於油箱。益現驚奇之色。有一年老者更向汽車行近。以手試探。忽其指觸及車上響號。聲若獸吼。竟致嚇退數步。厥狀可笑。於是君蠻對此奇異之物。均覺含有神秘不可思議之妙用。益不敢輕視。只存敬畏之心。而未敢作侵犯之想矣。美工程師等旣安然遇此。乃得從容進行。探察鑽鑛之舉。遂告成功焉。夫以蠻獠之天性嗜殺。動輙演出流血慘劇。今乃不費一矢、僅以一輛汽車。於一小時内竟將其野性克服。化兇爲馴。寗非至奇之事。若果當時該工程隊未携此物。則匪特探鑛之目的難達。并其性命恐亦弗保。是汽車之爲物。不僅足供代步。且能防護生命。其爲用誠大矣哉。</p>

<h3>Orders</h3>
<p>On the 24th, the National Government issued an order: Lü Huanyan, Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the 8th Route of the Anti-Rebel Army, was loyal, courageous, and naturally talented, and had been entrusted with important responsibilities. In recent years, he participated in military affairs in various anti-rebel campaigns in Guangdong and Guangxi, maintained local order, braved dangers, and made outstanding contributions. Guangxi's situation was roughly stabilized, and he was heavily relied upon. It is deeply regrettable that he was suddenly assassinated in Guangzhou. It is ordered that Lü Huanyan be handed over to the Executive Yuan for generous posthumous honors, and that the Guangdong Provincial Government be ordered to strictly apprehend the mastermind and bring them to justice, in order to comfort his loyal soul.

<h3>A Report of World Misfortune</h3>
<p>Most of the international news recently has been nothing more than the decline of commerce, the increase in unemployment, the plummeting of securities, and the disturbances in various colonies seeking freedom. Even today's news includes India's dissatisfaction with the investigation report, the continued decline of Japanese securities, the turmoil in the Egyptian Parliament, the strike of Spanish factory workers, the tense situation between France and Italy, France's fortification of border defenses, and Japan's decision on a new national defense plan. All of these are not optimistic events, and they happen every day, increasing rather than decreasing. Is this a good thing for the world?</p>
<p>The reasons for this are nothing more than two aspects. One is the reaction to the excessive development of industry, with a natural trend of commercial decline. As a result, countries that rely on industry and commerce cannot avoid being affected by this sudden change. This is an inevitable artificial consequence that has gradually emerged, and cannot be reversed in a short time by superficial reforms. The second is due to humanity's desire to compete and value strength, which cannot be fundamentally changed. As a result, although proposals for peace and disarmament are constantly emerging, most people still do not forget military force. Therefore, in the event of any discord, the final effort still relies on it. This kind of crisis among humans is becoming increasingly serious. Once something happens, it is easily triggered. With these two reasons, it is not surprising that there are so many unfortunate reports in world news.</p>

<h3>Tianjin Customs Incident</h3>
<p>The Consular Body Voluntarily Withdraws from Handling Affairs</p>
<p>Symons Hires New Customs Officers</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The authorities here absolutely cannot tolerate the Tianjin Consular Body's plan to handle customs clearance. Now, the other party also finds it difficult to gain international sympathy due to weak grounds. According to reports received by diplomatic circles on the 24th, the Consular Body has voluntarily withdrawn this plan. (24th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin Customs was extremely busy on the 24th with tax reporting and inspection. Symons told reporters that the situation today is better than yesterday. Two ships cleared customs for export today, collecting a total of over 30,000 taels in taxes. The Consular Body has acknowledged my takeover, and I can proceed without hindrance. The old customs officers who returned to work received double pay on the 24th, and advertisements were placed to recruit Chinese and foreign customs personnel. Ge Jingyou said that the Shanghai Customs' collection of Tianjin import taxes is illegal. We do not care. All ships entering will still be taxed according to regulations. Symons telegraphed Yan Xishan at noon on the 24th to request instructions on how to deal with the Shanghai Customs' double taxation. The Regular Customs did not issue salaries on the 24th, but will do so as soon as the salary list is completed. (24th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Symons rehired several foreign employees today, some of whom had previously served in the Customs. It is said that he has also received many letters from retired customs officers in Shanghai seeking employment. The current difficult problem is that taxes must be paid at both ends, and whether each side recognizes the taxes paid on the other side. In any case, shippers will suffer losses. Symons has sent a special telegram to Yan Xishan to request instructions. Symons is now confident that he can completely reorganize customs affairs. All key positions will be filled with old customs officers, with special emphasis on the inspection and valuation departments. (24th Reuters Telegram)</p>

Regarding the Tianjin Customs issue, the following opinion is gradually gaining strength: in the event of double taxation in the future, a compromise mediation will be made with both the North and the South based on Article 20 of the Sino-British Treaty, which stipulates that export and import taxes should be collected at the port of arrival and the port of departure.

<h3>The Case of Recovering the Shanghai Concession Telephone</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Communications recently sent a telegram to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Tax-Paying Chinese Association, the Citizens' United Association Preparatory Committee, etc., stating that the Sino-Foreign Telephone Company's letter to shareholders and users, regarding the sale to shareholders and the increase in rent fees, is nothing more than an attempt to deceive Chinese merchants and make them fools. This Ministry advocates actively recovering the telephone, upholding sovereignty in accordance with the policy of our Party's platform, and seeking the welfare of merchants and civilians. The original plan proposes that after the takeover, the original Chinese shares will be allowed to be converted into cash at market prices, or converted into new shares as commercial shares. The original foreign shares will be recovered by our government or Chinese merchants. The future business prices will only seek to maintain business prosperity and the interests of commercial shares. It is hoped that this will be explained in detail to all Chinese merchants holding shares, so that they know that those who support this Ministry's recovery are assisting the government in recovering national rights, and those who support selling to foreign merchants are sacrificing sovereignty and increasing restrictions. It is hoped that they will rise up and work together, and not be deceived. It is also hoped that the public will be aroused to work together to strive for it. (24th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Simon Commission</h3>
<p>India Investigation Report</p>
<p>The Detailed Recommendations are Contained in the Second Volume</p>
<p>Advocating Federal Autonomy</p>
<p>The Indian Newspaper Condemns it as a Poisonous Document</p>
<p>The Situation on the Northwest Frontier Remains Serious</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 23rd - The second volume of the report of the Indian Constitutional Investigation Commission has now been published. The commission, chaired by Sir John Simon, was dispatched to India by the House of Commons two years ago to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. The first volume of its report, which was released on the 9th of this month, described the general situation in India and the various problems that need to be addressed. The second volume, now published, details the unanimous recommendations of the commission, stating that the final constitution of India must be a federal constitution. The existing provinces of British India are by no means the best areas for self-government. The Indian government should send personnel to redefine the boundaries of the provinces. Each provincial government should have supreme autonomy, and each province should be the master of its own territory. The system of power distribution between local and central governments, i.e., the dyarchy system, should be abolished. Burma should become a separate region with its own head of state and not be subordinate to the Indian Governor-General. The venue for coordinating Indian and Burmese affairs should be London, not Delhi. Provincial legislatures should be expanded, based on the principle that one-tenth of the population should have the right to vote, tripling the current number. Women's suffrage should also be substantially increased. Each province should be administered by a provincial cabinet selected by the governor, but the governor has the power to revoke decisions in certain prescribed events. The Central Legislative Assembly should be reorganized into a Federal Parliament, composed of members elected by the provincial administrative councils using proportional representation. The Council of State should remain as before, and the existing legislative and financial powers of both houses should also remain unchanged. However, the Federal Parliament may have the power to vote on certain indirect taxes collected by the central authorities. The central executive body should consist of all the Governor-General's Executive Council members, who are appointed by the Governor-General. The Governor-General remains the representative of the British Emperor in all ceremonial matters and the de facto head of government. All future decisions remain the responsibility of the British Parliament. At present, changes cannot be made in the central scope as much as in the provincial constitution. The Indian Executive Council cannot be responsible to the Indian Federal Parliament in the same way as the British Cabinet is responsible to the British Parliament. The final system of the central government cannot be fully determined until the provinces become autonomous units. During India's transition to full autonomy, the northwest frontier should be properly secured. The troops stationed in India must have sufficient strength to undertake this task. The continued presence of British troops in India and the employment of British officers in the Indian army are still necessary for many years to come, the report said of India</p>

<h3>How to Prevent and Treat Summer Diseases</h3>

<p>To enjoy health and strength in the summer, it is essential to pay attention to the purity of the blood. Summer heat can thin the blood and reduce the body's resistance, making it susceptible to heatstroke, diarrhea, dysentery, and other symptoms. Moreover, weakened blood can lead to brain fatigue, weak stomach, headaches, mental confusion, and a host of other illnesses, leaving the body in an unsustainable state. Williams' Pink Pills, known for their ability to nourish and purify the blood, are a unique and invincible remedy suitable for both summer and winter, for the old and the young. Those who take them will not only enjoy a healthy and strong summer, but also those who suffer from summer diseases can rely on their blood-generating and evil-dispelling effects to recover. Chen Butao, a lieutenant colonel of the Infantry of the Army at 125 Bolijie, Beiping, wrote, "My body was strong, but due to overwork during military operations and incompatibility with the climate, my strength declined, my appetite decreased, and I suffered from diarrhea, coughing, and various other dangerous symptoms. Although I took various medicines, I did not recover. Later, Dr. Zhang recommended Williams' Pink Pills, and my blood and energy were immediately invigorated, my brainpower increased, and soon my body recovered and my spirit was full, becoming very strong again. Since then, I have never had any illness, which shows the great power of this pill."

<h3>Continued International News</h3>
<p>Regarding constitutional issues of defense, it is argued that the Governor-General, as the representative of imperial power, should be solely responsible under the auxiliary of the Commander-in-Chief of India, not by the Indian government. Therefore, the defense of the northwest frontier must be regarded as an event that is closely related to the entire empire and becomes an imperial duty. Furthermore, domestic disturbances are also a great danger, not just a matter of maintaining law and order. The lives of hundreds of millions of Indians are tied to the existence of a thorough and effective administrative body. Therefore, while the investigation team advocated for some progress towards autonomy, it declared the necessity of a kind of governance that could maintain the overall situation. The Governor-General and provincial governors must have sufficient power, and for the time being, they must maintain the power to protect minorities without bias. Indian civil and police affairs must still be handled by personnel dispatched by the Secretary of State for India, and higher courts should be centralized. The report finally mentioned the method of unifying all of India, saying that a Great Indian Council could be initiated to obtain organized consultation between British India and the Indian states. The investigation commission explained that its recommendations were based on the following principles: (1) The new constitution should contain provisions for its own development within itself, and future legislation must come from the needs of the times, not from the arbitrary requirements of a fixed procedure. (2) Changes to the constitution must be related to the future development of all of India's position in the empire. The new constitution must leave an open door for the Indian princes to join it on reasonable and fair terms. (3) The foundation of the government must be maintained. The report also stated that the original element of the investigation commission's method was to give Indians an opportunity to examine how the British parliamentary government system suits their needs and the characteristics of their people, based on their experience in the provincial scope.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 24th - The Nationalist Party's Bombay Chronicle published the Simon Commission's report with a large headline, "Poisonous Document." This shows the Nationalist Party's attitude towards the report.</p>
<p>Reuters, Simla, 24th - According to news from various parts of India, Indian politicians and newspapers are disappointed with the Simon Commission's recommendations. Even the Liberal Party's newspaper, the Allahabad Leader, called the recommendations worthy of rejection.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th - This morning's newspapers mostly discussed the recommendations contained in the second volume of the Simon Commission's report, all agreeing with the method of federal autonomy, acknowledging the necessity of enlisting the Indian princely states, and not opposing the separation of Burma and the abolition of dyarchy. However, opinions are not consistent on the general recommendations. The Daily Express said that the investigation team evaded the main issues and that its recommendations were not related to autonomy. Conservative newspapers were quite pleased with the report's recognition of the importance of military issues, but believed that the recommendation of local autonomy must be closely considered.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 23rd - Indian Secretary of War Beam today announced in the House of Commons the following situation in India for the week ending June 21: The tribes on the northwest frontier have gradually become peaceful, but are still worrying. The domestic situation is better than before, but troublemakers are still at work. Meetings are held frequently everywhere. No major riots occurred this week, but in several places, the leaders of the Nationalist Party were unable to restrain local authorities, leading to a trend towards riot. The tax resistance movement has not progressed except in Gujarat. The most noteworthy thing this week is the increase in cases of inciting the military and police. However, neither persuasion nor coercion has been effective. Indians with clearer heads who oppose the non-violent resistance movement are still increasing daily.</p>

<h3>Military Preparations Are Proceeding Rapidly</h3>
<p>Replenishing Troops and Ammunition in Morocco</p>
<p>Consolidating Border Fortifications</p>
<p>Relations with Italy Suddenly Become Tense</p>
<p>Paris News - Relations between France and Italy have suddenly become tense. The French government has decided to replenish the ammunition, bombs, and military equipment of the French troops stationed in Morocco. According to reliable sources, this was decided at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Tardieu. Chief of Staff General Weygand was also invited to attend. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has recently made exaggerated speeches to the Fascist Party on several occasions, which the French are extremely dissatisfied with. The main reason is the unresolved dispute between the two countries over the demarcation of the Libyan border. (World)</p>
<p>National Press, Rome, 23rd - The Italian press and political circles attach even greater importance to France's plans to reinforce fortresses along the Franco-Italian border than to all political issues. All newspapers condemn France as a disturber of peace, which could endanger the whole of Europe. Military and political circles estimate that the seven new fortresses planned to be built between Nice and Savona will require a total of 700 million francs from the French treasury. In addition, after completing the naval and land fortresses on Corsica, another 100 million francs will be needed. The Italian People's Newspaper said that the French claim that these fortresses are only for defensive purposes is ridiculous. France is using all the reparations it received from Germany for military preparations, and is not limited to its own territory, but is also subsidizing Yugoslavia to create a military dictatorship. In the past few months, a total of twelve French munitions, bullets, and ships have arrived at the ports of South Korea.</p>
<h3>Japan's New National Defense Plan</h3>
<p>The Main Content Has Been Decided</p>
<p>Electric News, Tokyo, 24th - The main content of Japan's new national defense plan drafted by Chief of Naval General Staff Taniguchi is as follows: (1) To make up for the shortage of submarines, aircraft will be used for daytime battles, and destroyers will be used for nighttime battles, and the restrictions on improving and replenishing fast foreign ships will be used to supplement them. (2) To make up for the lack of eight-inch gun cruisers, light cruisers of 10,000 tons with fourteen six-inch guns will be built for utilization. This is to implement the conversion of ship types from destroyers to light cruisers to compensate for the situation, according to the flexibility provisions of the London Treaty. Of the three major principles of national defense that were violated by the London Treaty's three-nation possession agreement, only the ratio of large cruisers and the maintenance of the existing submarine force are the key points that are being supplemented. However, the specific details will still take some time to be decided.</p>
<h3>Japanese Business Circles Are Shaken</h3>
<p>Securities Continue to Fall, and Morale is Uneasy</p>
<p>Electric News, Tokyo, 24 - The unprecedented great depression is deepening. The long-term stock market has been accumulating selling pressure since last week. Yesterday, the downward trend was even more severe, continuing to set new lows. Among the 213 listed stocks, only 23 companies, including Yokohama Specie Bank, Taiwan Sugar, and South Manchuria Railway, were able to maintain their par value. The market has become a panic-stricken, plummeting market, filled with an atmosphere of darkness. Morale recovered slightly at the close, but it still feels extremely uneasy.</p>
<h3>The Silk Industry is Declining, Adding to Unemployment</h3>
<p>Electric News, Tokyo, 24th - Japanese silk mills have implemented final wage reductions to prevent the deepening of the depression, but to no avail. The silk market fell sharply yesterday, and the panic in the silk industry has become even more profound. If this continues, I don't know where it will end. Yesterday, the silk market fell by another 7 yuan. According to this calculation, each company's cotton holdings, if purchased at high prices, will lose about 200,000 yuan per bale of 20-count yarn. Banks' vigilance about lending has therefore become more intense. Second- and third-rate silk mills have been forced to implement wage reductions above the agreed rate and have completely fallen into a pessimistic state. From January to May, the number of people laid off from silk and cloth factories affiliated with the Federation reached 17,219, and the trend will continue to increase in the future.</p>
<h3>British Colonial Office Meeting</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 23rd - The Colonial Office met this morning, with representatives from all British colonies. The agenda is very broad, including general development and administration, as well as discussions on radio broadcasting, civil aviation, films, gratuities, pensions, and other matters. Colonial Secretary Passfield delivered the opening remarks, saying that the first meeting will discuss the proposal to combine the administration of 30 colonial bureaus scattered around the world into a single colonial civil service organization. The second will discuss the unification of agricultural affairs. The government can allocate colonial development funds to investigate the unification of colonial railway track problems. Although the International League's charter emphasizes the concept of trust lands, which are kept on behalf of the local people, the British colonial system always recognizes that the first consideration should be the people of the land. In the evening, when the Colonial Secretary hosted a banquet for the representatives of the colonies, he announced that Sir Brooke, the administrative leader of Sarawak, had donated 100,000 pounds of British money for the mutual cooperation of the colonies. The government has accepted this money and will use three-quarters of it to help fund the education of female civil servants in the colonies throughout the Empire. The details have not yet been agreed upon. The remaining quarter has not yet been decided on its use.</p>
<h3>Spanish Factory Workers Strike</h3>
<p>Trouble with the Police, Shops Close</p>
<p>Reuters, Seville, Spain, 23rd - Rumors spread today that a female child in a factory was injured and died during a clash between police and strikers on Friday, causing great anger among the factory workers, who announced a general strike today. The strikers scattered iron nails on the roads to block traffic and threw stones at trams, forcing them to return to the factory. The police were forced to clash with the demonstrators repeatedly. All shops were closed. The strikers also tried to prevent bread from entering the city. Many people have been arrested, and several have been killed or injured.</p>

<h3>Public Suggests Methods to Ban Opium</h3>
<p>The Anti-Opium Committee Revises and Passes</p>
<p>The Central Anti-Opium Committee, based on the principle of rejecting drugs, submitted various suggestions related to opium prohibition to the government, hoping that the government would adopt them, but they must be submitted directly to the Anti-Opium Committee, which is in charge of opium prohibition, so that they can be considered and decided upon. Therefore, it specially formulated seven articles of the public's suggestions on opium prohibition, which were submitted to the 42nd meeting of the committee for revision and passage, and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval before being notified to the whole country for compliance. The articles are recorded as follows: (Article 1) The public's suggestions on opium prohibition shall be submitted to the Anti-Opium Committee in a memorandum and a letter of suggestion. (Article 2) The letter of suggestion shall detail the reasons and methods, and if there are facts or objects that can be used as evidence, they shall be stated and submitted together. (Article 3) The suggester must sign, seal, or countersign the memorandum and letter of suggestion, and state their age, place of origin, address, and occupation. (Article 4) If the suggester is a public organization, in addition to the provisions of Article 2 of these measures, the organization's stamp shall be affixed to the memorandum and letter of suggestion, and the representative shall sign, seal, or countersign. (Article 5) If the opium prohibition suggestions involve various ministries of the central government, the Anti-Opium Committee shall separately review and forward them. (Article 6) The suggestions submitted by the National Government or the Executive Yuan and various ministries may be notified by the Anti-Opium Committee to the original suggester to handle in accordance with the provisions of these measures. (Article 7) These measures shall be implemented from the date of submission to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>
<h3>Recent Political Situation in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>Chen Qicai's Report at the Provincial Government Memorial Week</p>
<p>Chen Qicai, member of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee and concurrently Director of the Department of Finance, reported on the recent political situation in Jiangsu Province at the 156th Memorial Week of the Provincial Government yesterday (the 23rd), as follows: "Chairman, fellow members, it has been three months since I took office. I have rarely attended Memorial Week here, mainly because of my poor health. I have had to go to Shanghai frequently to rest and, incidentally, to seek medical treatment, hoping to recover my health so I can work diligently. However, my time in Shanghai was not entirely for recuperation; I also handled provincial government affairs directly or indirectly. Although I am not here, I have seen the political reports and speeches of the various committee members in the newspapers, which have been very detailed. Today, I can only give you a general overview of the recent provincial administration. (1) Civil Affairs: Recently, the focus has been on bandits, because the bandits in various counties are rampant, especially in northern Jiangsu. The people not only cannot live and work in peace, but even the four words 'preserve their lives' are probably unreliable. Because kidnappers are everywhere now, people have no way to defend themselves, so the government is paying special attention to bandit suppression measures, establishing a security office dedicated to this task. However, regarding bandit suppression, it is a matter of secrecy and cannot be discussed in detail. The overall goal is to reduce the number of bandits from many to few, and from few to none. On the one hand, county magistrates and public security chiefs are strictly ordered to work hard to suppress bandits, and to achieve the goal of people living and working in peace in the shortest possible time. (2) Construction: People with a superficial view say it is destruction. In fact, if the government wants to build, it must remove all obstacles to construction. For example, building roads requires demolishing houses. Superficially, demolishing houses is destruction, of course, but how can we build wide roads that meet the needs of the times without removing the houses on both sides of the old narrow streets? Therefore, demolishing houses is not destruction, but the initial step of construction. This needs to be understood and appreciated by everyone. Since its reorganization, the provincial government has focused on construction as the first step. Construction requires funding, so there is a plan to issue 7 million in construction bonds. Central approval should be obtained soon. Once the funds are fully raised, construction will be very effective. As for how to build, the Department of Construction will design and announce it in succession. (3)</p>

<p>Agriculture and Mining: National livelihood depends on industry, and agriculture and mining include all kinds of industries. Now, the Department of Agriculture and Mining is because Jiangsu... when they come there is an appearance of famine, especially this year's silkworm famine, the people's wealth measuring is reduced in degrees, already... spare force to actively research, such as eliminating locusts, prohibiting silkworm egg kinds of... according to such continued advance, at least also can reduce famine degree, but industry one layer, is not urgently seek quick effect of the matter, does not have what very significant result, can in very short time exhibit come out, and use of funds but is in the minority, easy to cause public opinion, regarding this point, I hope agriculture and mining authorities don't lose heart, I hope compatriots more to understand and sponsor. (4) Education: Jiangsu's education has been steadily advanced by Director Chen, following the plans of the central government and local areas. Soon, the previous educational situation will be changed to Party-oriented education. However, the most important thing in education is teachers. The teachers in Jiangsu, especially in the countryside, can hardly maintain their lives. They all have the phenomenon of "not being able to help the dying" as Mencius said. How can we expect them to work diligently with peace of mind? Therefore, from the 19th year onwards, we must maintain them, that is, to equalize and increase their salaries, so that they can work diligently with peace of mind. Also, popular education is even more important. All departments are now preparing and actively proceeding, hoping everyone will work hard to help adult remedial education. (5) Finance: Now, under the Chairman's order, the budget for the 19th year is being discussed. The draft has been submitted to the government by the Department of Finance, but only the income item. As for expenditures, various committees must handle it together. The reserve fund in the budget is tentatively set at 5% or 7%. In the past, Jiangsu's finances could not establish a budget because income and expenditure could not match. Now, the committee members have earnestly consulted, seeking to increase income and reduce expenditure. However, the most difficult thing is that administrative expenses have reached the point where they cannot be reduced any further, but they are still very large. Regarding this point, the committee members are very understanding. Even if there are difficulties, it should not be a hindrance. The above is a general report on Jiangsu's finances. I also have the following two thoughts on China's finances. (A) Nurturing Wealth: The ancients said, "If the people are sufficient, with whom will the ruler be insufficient?" In today's era, the word "ruler" naturally means "nation." It is absolutely impossible for the nation to be rich while the people are poor. Therefore, we must first enrich the people. Enriching the people is enriching the nation. Sun Yat-sen said that China is a semi-colony, so of course we must seek to become strong. If the nation is not rich, it can never become strong. If the people are not rich, the nation has no way to become rich. Speaking of the wealth of the Chinese people, it is truly pitiful. Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou in Zhejiang, and Suzhou, Songjiang, and Taicang in Jiangsu, everyone says they are the richest in the world. In reality, they are indeed a little richer than other places, but the villagers there are still very poor. This year, as soon as there is a silkworm famine, many people immediately think of ending their lives. How can they be truly rich? Nurturing wealth is like raising chickens. The source of taxation is the chicken eggs. First, we must fatten the chickens, and then take the eggs. Naturally, the source will be endless. If we seek to obtain them by harsh taxation, even the chickens' lives will be difficult to protect. Where will we have eggs to eat? Fattening the chickens is nurturing wealth. Nurturing wealth depends entirely on the efforts of the agriculture and mining authorities. (B) Patriotism: Now, almost everyone knows patriotism and can talk about patriotism, but in reality, the result is the opposite. Look at the Chinese people, which one is not wearing foreign goods, promoting foreign goods? Can this be considered patriotism? Therefore, the two words "patriotism" must be practical, that is, to practice resisting foreign goods. Only when it is unavoidable (that is, when China does not have this product and it cannot be done without) should we use foreign goods, and we must carefully consider whether this matter is important or not, and whether it is worthwhile or not. For example, medicine for treating diseases is life-saving and can be considered important. Scientific books are for increasing knowledge and can be considered worthwhile. Everything else should be done without using foreign goods. In the past, according to the customs import surplus, averaged by the Chinese population, each person had to pay two yuan per year. Now, villagers use foreign oil, smoke foreign cigarettes (mostly British-made cigarettes), wear foreign cloth, and so on. The list is endless. I am afraid that each person has to pay five yuan per year. In total, hundreds of millions are overflowing each year. Do you think it is alarming and frightening? The way to remedy this is to promote practical and realistic patriotism. This depends on the education authorities. If we can attach patriotic movements to the promotion of universal education, and focus on patriotic inculcation in elementary school textbooks, we will naturally achieve great results. The above is what I have spoken about regarding my feelings about China's finances. If we can increase production on the one hand and resist foreign goods on the other, there is no reason why the country should not be rich."</p>
<h3>Northeast Fleet to Sail to Huludao</h3>
<p>To Attend the Groundbreaking Ceremony</p>
<p>Qingdao Communication: Shen Honglie, commander of the Northeast Navy, came to Qingdao from Liaoning a few days ago to inspect the defense. Because the current situation is tense and the naval defense is extremely important, Shen specially accompanied Ling Xiao, commander of the First Fleet, on the Haihe ship to Xuejiadao yesterday to inspect and take the opportunity to review the training of the various ships under his command. It is heard that they will return to Qingdao on the 23rd. Because Huludao has been scheduled to hold the groundbreaking ceremony on July 1st, the fleet stationed in Qingdao has been ordered to sail to participate. After Shen returns to Qingdao from Xuejiadao, he will personally lead the Haiqi, Haichen, Yongxiang, and Haihe ships, as well as the aircraft team, to Huludao on the 24th to participate in the grand ceremony. As for the naval defense of this city, the Zhaowu ship will be left to maintain it. It is heard that Shen will still lead the fleet back to Qingdao after the ceremony. (June 22nd)</p>
<h3>Key Suspect in the Lü Case Still Under Interrogation</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Feng Mingsheng, the murderer who assassinated Lü Huanyan, has been detained in the Criminal Prison of the Public Security Bureau for several days under strict guard. It is rumored that he has been transferred to the Military Police Headquarters, but this is not true. Because the authorities want to thoroughly investigate the whereabouts of the mastermind and the accomplices involved in the case, investigators have been dispatched to Henan and other places to arrest several suspects, who have been detained for interrogation. More than ten attendants and soldiers who came to Guangdong with Lü, residing in hotels, and those who lived on Lü's vehicle ship were all detained on the evening of the incident. Except for the staff officer, adjutant, section chief, and director, who were released after Staff Officer Wu proved their identities, the rest of Lü's guard captain and six guards, as well as two people who came to Lü seeking employment, have been detained in the Public Security Bureau and have not been released yet. It is heard that except for these two people, the rest of the suspects are still under strict guard. Yesterday, the 17th, Lü's Chief of Staff Wu Fan personally went to the Public Security Bureau and, together with Chen Yansheng, director of the Police Interrogation Office, interrogated the main culprit Feng Mingsheng in the inner living room opposite the director's office, barring everyone else from entering. First, Feng Mingsheng was interrogated again and again, investigating the whereabouts of the two masterminds, Qin and Liang, in Guangxi and their past actions after arriving in Guangzhou. The interrogation lasted from 3:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., and the suspect was taken back into custody. Then, guard captain Ling Guicai, guards Ke Sen, Jiang Dongshan, Qin Kongbao, Chen Detong, Huang Zhenyun, Chen Shande, as well as staff members, guards Meng Xiong, Li Wenbiao, Lü Shi, Mo Shi, and Huang Qiongqing and Qiu Nan, who came to seek employment, and Yu Mingjun, a total of fourteen people, were interrogated one by one. As a result, only Huang Qiongqing was released on bail, and the rest were detained until after 6:00 p.m. After Staff Officer Wu recorded the confessions of the various people, he took a copy back with him. Subsequently, at 7:00 p.m., the Public Security Bureau dispatched a large team of investigators to a large hospital in Dongshan to arrest a person who was highly suspected of being involved in the case. It is heard that he was dressed as a military officer and was from Guangxi, but his name is still being kept secret. After being arrested and returned to the bureau, he was detained in the Investigation Section of the bureau under strict guard, and interrogated once by the bureau members overnight. It is reported that this person holds an important position in the military and is very closely related to the case. The Public Security Bureau has informed Staff Officer Wu by telephone and asked him to come to the bureau in person on the 18th to interrogate him. It can be seen how important he is. Also, Pan Huiying, the wife of Liang, a student of the Whampoa Military Academy who was on the run, was captured at the Mingli Inn and is currently being held in the Public Security Bureau. On the 17th, Staff Officer Wu interrogated Pan about her husband's whereabouts. It was found that Pan was also from Guangxi and was a student at a girls' school in Guangzhou. She had been married to Liang for three years and had a son. They had been renting a house on a certain street and living together. Recently, they moved to the inn a week ago. On the evening of Lü's assassination, Liang hurriedly left with his luggage at about 1:00 a.m., presumably knowing that Lü had been assassinated and fleeing. When asked where Liang had gone, Pan denied knowing anything. The authorities have sent police detectives to Hong Kong and Macau on ships, and at the same time dispatched detectives to investigate in various directions. They are also afraid that they have established organizations in Guangxi, and Wu Fan has also telegraphed various places in Guangxi, strictly investigating. But as of now, there is still no whereabouts. (18th)</p>
<h3>Bandit Gang in Qianshan, Anhui Has Been Repelled</h3>
<p>Anqing Communication: Qianshan is close to the province, and has been disturbed by soldiers and bandits for years, with hardly any peaceful days. Recently, a bandit gang attacked the county seat again. Tang Yunshan, the brigade commander of the 15th Independent Brigade stationed in the province, dispatched a battalion of the first regiment of the brigade, Luo Qi stationed in Gaohebu, to suppress them. According to reports from the county, on the 18th of this month at dawn, a gang of thousands of bandits swarmed in and surrounded the county seat, attacking in three routes. Cui Shulong, the county magistrate, ordered the county government police team to work together with the self-defense corps of various districts to defend with effort. From 4:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon, the fierce battle lasted for eight hours. The bandits were unable to withstand it and began to retreat north. After the incident was investigated, the official side killed one member of the self-defense corps and injured two. The bandit side killed more than a hundred people and seized more than ten guns and a telescope. After the bandit gang was repelled, the people in the city were alarmed and feared the bandits' revenge, and were unable to sleep all night. Therefore, Magistrate Cui immediately telegraphed the provincial government, requesting the dispatch of troops for reinforcements. The troops of the Tang brigade have arrived in the territory at 1:00 p.m. on the 19th, surrounding from Yujiajing. The county's self-defense corps also set out from the county to pursue together. Yu Yimi, a prominent gentry in the county, has successively served as the governor and director of finance of Anhui Province. Due to the rampant banditry and communism in recent years, the family property has suffered huge losses. Now, in order to stop the banditry, he has donated tens of thousands of yuan to the provincial government to apply for passports, purchase guns and ammunition, and increase the number of self-defense corps to prepare for defense and to ensure local peace.

<h3>Rampant Banditry in Dexing and Wan'an, Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Requests for Troops to Suppress Bandits Arrive Several Times a Day</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Since Zhang Huizan and Jin Handing's divisions entered Hunan, only the newly编13th Division, one brigade of the 12th Division, two regiments of the provincial defense police regiment, and the independent团of the Fifth Division remained in Jiangxi. The defense was thus weakened, and the banditry became more rampant. Counties such as Yongxin, Lianhua, and Ninggang in western Jiangxi have indeed been captured, and counties such as Jishui and Ji'an are also nominally existing, only able to maintain a corner of the urban area. Rural farmers are mostly forced by the Communist Party to be compiled into red guards, guerrillas, and farmer self-defense forces, burning and killing everywhere. Those with property become landless, and the landless become bandits, so that the strength of the bandits and communists is increasing day by day. Wan'an is located west of the Gan River, at the intersection of Ji'an and Ganzhou, and has now been captured by the communist bandits. Zhang Zhidong, the county magistrate, has telegraphed the province for assistance. The Director of Civil Affairs, according to the telegram, has reported to Commander-in-Chief Lu, requesting that Jin's division and Ma's旅in Ganzhou be dispatched to suppress the bandits. Also, Fang Zhimin, the communist leader in eastern Jiangxi, has more than 800 guns, and Shao Shiping has 600 to 700 guns. Counties such as Yiyang, Dexing, Leping, and Wannian on the border of Jiangxi and Zhejiang have all been ravaged by them. Since Dai's brigade was transferred to northern Jiangxi to enter Hunan, although a police regiment took over the defense, Fang and Shao took advantage of the transition of the old and new forces to capture Yiyang and the port of Dexing, invading Wannian, Yugan, and Poyang in the hinterland of eastern Jiangxi. Fortunately, Jiang Bozhang, the magistrate of Poyang County, personally supervised the Jingwei team to depart from Wannian to resist them, and also joined forces with neighboring counties to suppress them, and the bandits began to retreat slightly. At present, although He Kou and Yiyang have been recovered by Zeng's group, Dexing is still occupied by Fang Zhimin. Guo Fei, the acting magistrate of Dexing County, fled to the border of Zhejiang. Yesterday, the Department of Civil Affairs received a telegram from him saying, "The fish garrison withdrew, Gengcheng fell, the police Jing teams are led by the position in Zhejiang Chui, please send a team to recover quickly." Wannian in northern Jiangxi borders Liuyang in Hunan. Since last year, it has been captured more than ten times by the communist bandits Peng Huang. It is heard that the county was recently occupied by the Peng bandits, burning hundreds of houses and killing countless people. All the residents in the city were robbed. Although it has now been recovered by the troops stationed in Shanggao, there are not many defense forces and they are still in panic. Ruichang borders Yangxin in Hubei. After Peng's bandits were defeated in Yangxin, they led three or four thousand people to sneak into Ruichang, intending to disturb the Nanchang-Xunyang Road. Fortunately, Zhu's團of Wang's Brigade defeated them, so nothing happened. Recently, requests from border counties for troops to suppress bandits arrive several times a day. The local security is difficult to be optimistic. (18th)</p>
<h3>Fifth Batch of Relief Grain from the Famine Relief Association Shipped to Shaanxi</h3>
<p>Pingxun on the 17th: The special train used by the China and Foreign Famine Relief Association to transport grain was once taken back by the competent authorities for their own use due to busy military transportation. It has now been returned. The association also shipped the fifth batch of relief grain from Shijiazhuang on June 13th, totaling 580 tons of millet and sorghum, to Lingbao, so as to be transferred to the disaster area in Shaanxi for use. After the above-mentioned millet arrives in Lingbao, it is planned to still use boats, as in the past, via the Yellow River to Tongguan. Tongguan is only 41 miles away from Lingbao, but the river is winding and the journey is more than twice as far. When the wind is favorable, it takes about ten to fourteen days for the boat to travel. After the above-mentioned relief grain arrives in Tongguan, a part will be landed and converted to handcarts, which will be pushed by the victims to nearby villages for distribution, and the remaining part will be transferred to the Wei River and transported to Weinan, which is about 52 miles long. After landing in Weinan, it will be converted to automobiles, passing through 60 miles to Xianyang, and then transported by handcarts to various villages for use. The disaster villages near Weinan plan to directly use handcarts to transport them from Weinan. At present, the irrigated land in the Xi'an Plain has obtained abundant wheat harvests, but in higher-altitude areas, the harvest is still only 5% before September, so it is still necessary to transport grain from other provinces for relief. In addition, after the association ships out the fifth batch of relief grain, all the relief grain purchased from the eastern provinces has been shipped, and there is no remaining grain.</p>
<h3>Liaoning Provincial Government Plans to Build the Shenyang-Liaoyang Railway</h3>
<p>Construction Cost: 1.5 Million</p>
<p>Construction Can Begin in Mid-August</p>
<p>Shenyang Communication: The transportation business in Northeast China has developed considerably in recent years. In addition to the Shenhai, Jihai, and Taoang lines, which have long been completed and whose business results are becoming more perfect every day, plans are also being made to add and repair the Shenre and Shenkai lines. Recently, the Liaoning Provincial Government and the Northeast Transportation Committee agreed to lay the railway between Shenyang and Liaoyang. Because Liaoyang is a prosperous area with frequent trade with Shenyang, it is really necessary for the government to build a road directly to it. It is heard that the main points of the plan are that the distance between the two places is about 120 miles, a single-track road will be built, and the construction cost will be about 1.5 million silver dollars, which will be completely borne by the Liaoning Provincial Government. All construction work, surveying, and design will be entrusted to the Transportation Committee. After completion, a management bureau will be established in the province, supervised by the Provincial Government, and a director will be appointed to manage the road affairs. As for the details of the road route passing through various places, they will be stipulated in detail to ensure that there is a considerable distance from the South Manchuria Railway, and that the original treaty is not violated. Currently, preparations are being actively made to establish a construction office, and it is planned to start construction in mid-August. (June 19th)</p>
<h3>Manzhouli Customs Seizes a Large Batch of Drugs</h3>
<p>Weight: More Than 40 Pounds</p>
<p>The Carrier is a French Woman</p>
<p>Harbin Communication: On the 17th of this month, the Eurasian train arrived at Manzhouli from Soviet Russia. Local customs officers boarded the train to inspect it as usual. In a second-class sleeper car, they caught sight of two very large leather suitcases piled on a berth, sealed very tightly. When asked about the owner, it was said to belong to a French woman, La脱窦娜. She claimed that the suitcases contained clothes and other items. The customs wanted her to open them for inspection, but she insisted that she had been entrusted by others and did not have the key with her. Later, after the customs officer repeatedly demanded it, she finally handed over the key. When they were opened, except for a few pieces of clothing covering the upper layer, the rest of the two suitcases were filled with prohibited items such as morphine and 高根, totaling about 40 pounds. At that time, a Russian named 马克斯芬 was present, claiming to be a doctor, proving that the prohibited items were soap powder and bathing materials. The French woman also stepped forward and argued eloquently. The customs was afraid of incriminating innocent people, so they only detained the items and sent them to Harbin for testing. At the same time, the French woman was allowed to enter the country. Later, after testing by the Harbin Customs, it was confirmed that they were indeed drugs. It was known that the French woman and the Russian man 马克斯芬 must be accomplices, who had designed to escape at the time. Therefore, a letter was sent to the Special Police Detective Bureau for investigation. Yesterday, the Detective Bureau discovered the French woman La脱窦娜 in Room 19 of the 格兰法 Hotel in Qinjiagang. The Russian man 马克斯芬 was arrested at the 列尼山斯 Hotel on Chinese Street in Daoli and sent to the Detective Bureau for interrogation. After the two criminals arrived at the bureau, they still refused to tell the truth, so they were sent to the management office for punishment that evening. It is heard that the criminals planned to transport the drugs to Shanghai for sale, but unfortunately they were caught in Manzhouli. (20th)</p>

<p>The County Public Security Bureau's Funds Are Reduced. Li Zhibin, the director of the County Public Security Bureau, in order to seek the balanced development of public security undertakings in the county area, voluntarily reduced the monthly amount paid by the General Bureau by 1,500 yuan.

<p>The Vendetta Case in Xin'an Town. Xu Fuchun, a member of the Xin'an Town Security Corps in Wuyi, had behaved badly in the past. Recently, he was dismissed by squad leader Liu Lin. Xu harbored a grudge and went to the city to order two sharp blades, and then sneaked into the corps. On the morning of the 23rd at about 3:00 a.m., taking advantage of Liu's deep sleep, he stabbed him all over his body with a knife, a total of seventeen or eighteen stabs. The intestines also flowed out of the abdomen by thirty or forty. Liu still resisted, but soon could not support himself and fell to the ground. At this time, Wang Yunlong, a guard at the door, heard the sound and went to rescue him, and was also stabbed five or six times and fell to the ground, and escaped in the meantime. Afterwards, the injured were carried to Wujin Hospital in the city for treatment. It is heard that Wang Yunlong's injuries can still be treated, but Liu Lin's condition is critical at any moment.</p>

<p>The Doctor Kidnapped in Yanmu is Out of Danger. Chen Ziqing, a pediatrician in Tagang, Yanmu District, was kidnapped a few days ago by bandits who pretended to be asking for medical treatment for the purpose of extorting a ransom. Now, Chen's family has pleaded for help, and yesterday the bandits released Chen Ziqing.</p>
<p>The Price of Rice in the County Rose Again Yesterday. The price of rice in the county had already risen by eight jiao in June. Yesterday (the 22nd), the price of various types of rice rose by another two jiao. Tou dong (early winter rice) is 17 yuan and 8 jiao, Bai geng (white japonica rice) is 17 yuan and 6 jiao, Saigon rice is 17 yuan and 1 jiao, and coarse rice is 16 yuan and 2 jiao. Currently, there is no rice left in the countryside, and it is feared that the price will rise again.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Steamship Smashes Fish Pond: Zhang Keqing, who lives in the Yuchi Lane of the northern countryside of Suzhou, owns numerous fish ponds, raising many fish. During the heavy rain the other day, two scheduled boats traveling to Wuxi, Daqiangmen, Meicun, etc., passed by at full speed, smashing over a thousand "zhang" (unit of length) of Zhang's fish pond, causing enormous losses. Yesterday, Zhang submitted a report to the Suzhou Customs Supervisor, requesting relief.</p>
<p>Li and Cheng's Mutual Lawsuit Scheduled for Sentencing: The case of former Premier Li Genyuan and his abandoned concubine Cheng Peiyi mutually suing each other in the Wu County District Court, in which the court sentenced Cheng Peiyi to a fine of fifteen silver dollars on April 28 for defamation, was appealed by Cheng to the original trial court. The hearing took place on the 6th of this month, but due to the absence of witness Shi Ruhe, Cheng requested the extraction of Shi Ruhe's testimony from the West District Police Station from one month prior, and a retrial was scheduled. Yesterday (the 24th) at 4 p.m., Judge Xiao again subpoenaed Li and Cheng along with Shi Ru for questioning. Apart from Cheng, who came from Shanghai to Suzhou accompanied by her sister Peiyu to report, Li and the others did not arrive. Cheng Peiyi testified that she was 30 years old, from Anhui, residing at her sister Peiyu's home in the Shouxing Lane in Shanghai. Her sister's husband, Mr. Xie, works in the Navy Department. This appeal is divided into two parts: (1) I am dissatisfied with the conviction and sentence imposed by the first instance because the petition in which I accused Li Genyuan was submitted to the Women's Association. The term "warlord" refers to Li's personal manner of treating people like a warlord. Furthermore, the matter of publishing in the newspaper was due to the newspaper office copying the original petition from the Women's Association; I did not desire for the petition to be published. (2) I am dissatisfied with the first instance's counterclaim that Li Genyuan obstructed freedom, declaring Li Genyuan not guilty. On the fourth day of the twelfth month of last year, after my sister Peiyu and I arrived in Suzhou from Shanghai, on the fifth day we visited Li Genyuan. Zhu Jian was seen by Shi Ruhe, who took us to a hotel, and then sent me to the Chengzhong Hotel in Gong Lane. The next day, he (referring to Shi Ru) and three other monks came with monks' robes and hats, persuading me to become a nun. I did not agree. On the seventh day, Shi Ru came again, calling me to the Zhaoshang Hotel, saying Li Genyuan was there. I arrived with my sister Peiyu at the Zhaoshang Hotel on the afternoon of the eighth. He said Li Genyuan would arrive shortly, but after waiting and waiting, two monks arrived and threatened me, telling me to put on the monks' robes and hats, claiming they were acting on Li Genyuan's orders to take me to Guanyin Mountain in Yangzhou to become a nun. If I did not put on the monks' robes, they would not allow me to leave. My sister, seeing the situation was not good, immediately went outside to report to the police on duty. The police came, and the monks disappeared. We then went to the West District Police Station. Of course, I did not want to become a nun; if I wanted to become a nun, I would not have married Li Genyuan. The official asked, "Did you also go when you reported to the police on duty?" She answered, "How could I come out, being in the room? My sister went to report." The official asked, "Checking the case files of the West District, there were two people who reported at the time?" She answered, "That was my sister's companion." The official asked, "Do you know the monk Shi Ruhe?" She answered, "I do not know him." The official asked, "Since you did not know him, how could you agree to go with him to the Zhaoshang Hotel?" She answered, "After arriving in Suzhou, I stayed at the Chengzhong Hotel, which was where Li Genyuan sent Shi Ru to take me, so I trusted him greatly. I have now learned that Guanyin Mountain in Yangzhou is not a nunnery, but a monastery." The official asked, "When did you marry Li Genyuan?" She answered, "I married him on April 11th of the twelfth year of the Republic (1923)." The official asked, "How did you leave later?" She answered, "The following year, he went to Beijing." The official asked, "Where did you live at that time?" She answered, "When I married him, he returned from Guangdong and was living on Baker Road in Shanghai." At this point, the official ordered Cheng Peiyi to sit aside, first allowing Cheng's lawyer, Tao Jianshan, to state the reasons for the appeal, followed by Li Genyuan's representative lawyer, Tang Shenfang, and Shi Ru's representative lawyer, Xie Hanfan, to argue in succession. The judge announced the conclusion of the arguments, scheduled the sentencing for the 30th of this month, and then adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Finding a Lost Child - Reward</h3>
<p>Zhu Jinyao, from Ningbo, is only four years old. He has a shaved head and was wearing a padded jacket of floral red Chongzhi tribute cloth, floral Chongzhi tribute cloth pants, floral green plaid socks, and chicken skin shoes. He went missing around 1 p.m. on June 22nd. Any kind person who knows his whereabouts and brings him back will be rewarded with 100 silver dollars. Anyone who provides information leading to his return will be rewarded with 50 silver dollars. We absolutely will not break our promise. This is a special announcement in the Shen and Xin two newspapers. Contact address: Zhu Wende, 7 Yuqing Lane, Xiaobeimenwai. Special Advertisement No. 1833. The official asked, "After arriving in Suzhou, you stayed at the Chengzhong Hotel, which was where Li Genyuan sent Shi Ru to take you, so I trusted him greatly. I have now learned that Guanyin Mountain in Yangzhou is not a nunnery, but a monastery." The official asked, "When did you marry Li Genyuan?" She answered, "I married him on April 11th of the twelfth year of the Republic." The official asked, "How did you leave later?" She answered, "The following year, he went to Beijing." The official asked, "Where did you live at that time?" She answered, "When I married him, he returned from Guangdong and was living on Baker Road in Shanghai." At this point, the official ordered Cheng Peiyi to sit aside, first allowing Cheng's lawyer, Tao Jianshan, to state the reasons for the appeal, followed by Li Genyuan's representative lawyer, Tang Shenfang, and Shi Ru's representative lawyer, Xie Hanfan, to argue in succession. The judge announced the conclusion of the arguments, scheduled the sentencing for the 30th of this month, and then adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>The Difficulty of Rice Seedling Shortage in Farmland: Farmers typically use waterwheels to irrigate fields and sow rice during the Lesser Fullness solar term. After the Grain in Ear solar term, when the seedlings grow to several inches, they are then transplanted. However, during the sowing period, farmers must estimate the required seedlings and prepare some extra in case of shortages. This year, half of the sown rice seeds have failed to sprout, making them insufficient for transplanting. Asking neighbors for extra seedlings resulted in "little to none." Attempting to resow is already considered too late. They had to travel to other counties to find ways to purchase them at the expensive price of one silver dollar per thousand seedlings, which was not easy to obtain.</p>
<p>The Impoverished Life of People with Rice as Precious as Pearls and Firewood as Expensive as Cassia: The price of rice in this county has gradually soared from the winter of last year until now. Currently, high-quality white rice has reached 19 silver dollars per "shi" (unit of volume), and foreign currency is also above 17 silver dollars, with a continuing upward trend. People of the middle and lower classes either changed their meals to porridge or reduced one meal. Farmers mostly eat wheat bran, and it is not easy to get enough to eat. Fuel is hard firewood, priced at over 2,000 "wen" (unit of currency) per "dan" (unit of weight), and rice straw costs 1,400 to 1,500 "wen," but it is still difficult to purchase. As a result, fences and bamboo fences in the countryside are often stolen and sold. Furthermore, due to the difficulty of making a living, there have been frequent reports of people taking their own lives.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Provincial Patrol Propaganda Team Arrives in Wuxi: The patrol propaganda team organized by the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department set off to various counties to carry out propaganda. The team arrived in Wuxi yesterday morning. The team leader is Ma Chaowen, and the deputy team leader is Gai Fuchu. There are eight team members. After arriving in Wuxi, they stayed at the Park Hotel. They scheduled a discussion meeting with various agencies, groups, and schools in this county at the County Party Department today (the 25th). They scheduled a costumed parade for tomorrow morning. The team has borrowed ten white horses from the Police Brigade Patrol Team for use. In the afternoon, they will convene a public meeting at the Provincial Wuxi High School to give public speeches and invite various schools to perform entertainment.</p>
<p>Investigation of Rice Hoarding Amid High Rice Prices: The price of rice in this county has gradually increased, reaching a substantial 18.9 silver dollars per "shi," with a continuing upward trend. The livelihood of the common people is in imminent danger. A rice-grabbing incident by villagers occurred in front of the Daqiao Bridge near Houyangfang the other day. If appropriate measures are not taken promptly, the consequences will be dire. An investigation revealed that the rice market had only increases and no decreases, inevitably indicating that someone was manipulating it by hoarding and speculating. An investigation of the exact amount of rice hoarded by major firms in the county revealed that a total of 380,000 "shi" of rice was hoarded by twelve firms, including: Yongmao Firm, over 40,000 "shi"; Tongde Firm, 38,000 "shi"; Yuanda Firm, 38,000 "shi"; Baoxin Firm, 35,000 "shi"; Baotai Firm, 35,000 "shi"; Yuxin Firm, 34,000 "shi"; Zhenxin Firm, 36,000 "shi"; Dexin Firm, 22,000 "shi"; Yitaiyong, 32,000 "shi"; Zouchengtai, 32,000 "shi"; Yixin Firm, 17,000 "shi"; and Yonghe Firm, 13,000 "shi." Thus, it was suddenly realized that the reason for the daily increase in rice prices was due to the large amount of rice being hoarded by wealthy merchants, with very little circulating in the market. With this manipulation, how could rice prices not be expensive? It is hoped that the government will quickly take measures to activate this large batch of hoarded rice in the market, unblock the sources of supply, and provide successive relief. At the same time, it should quickly carry out price controls to provide relief. Labor-Management Issues in Silk Factories: The labor-management dispute in the silk factories of this county has continued for three months. The 24 demands proposed by the labor side (Silk Factory Workers' Union) and the revision of the labor contract have been tentatively accepted by the management side (Silk Factory Trade Association). When both parties were scheduled to sign the contract at the Silk Factory Trade Association on the 19th of this month, only one-third of the management representatives arrived. Due to the lack of a legal quorum, a discussion meeting was held and it was decided to postpone the meeting for four days. The day before yesterday was the date for continuing the previous discussion and formally signing the labor-management contract. More than fifty representatives from both labor and management attended. First, labor representatives such as Hua Nianzu and Tao Shensheng spoke in succession, stating that the 24 demands put forward by the Workers' Union were indeed born out of necessity, as the current price of rice has risen to 19 silver dollars, more than double what it was when the old contract was signed. At a time when the livelihoods of workers cannot be secured, they hoped that the management would show great compassion and do their best to accommodate them, and the workers would certainly repay them with gratitude. Subsequently, Qian Fenghao of the management side finished speaking, and the discussion began. Unexpectedly, the management suddenly went back on its word regarding the signing of the labor-management contract, claiming that all the representatives opposed it and using the strike that occurred at the Deda Yu Silk Factory the day before as an excuse for not being able to sign the contract. At the same time, Qian Fenghao, Xie You'an, and Yang Yuchu, executive members of the Silk Factory Trade Association, suddenly resigned, expressing that they would not be responsible. As a result, the discussion lasted for four hours without any resolution, and the contract was still not signed. Finally, Zhang Renjie, executive member of the People's Training Association, considered the opinions of both sides and drafted a mediation plan for further discussion. Yesterday, the Silk Factory Workers' Union published a notice to all its members, stating that due to the unreasonable oppression by the management, there was an opportunity for reactionary incitement, hoping that they would understand the union's efforts and wait patiently for a resolution.</p>
<p>Another Kidnapping Case Reported in Yangming: The home of Zhu Yunhe, a resident of Dadi Lane in Yangming Township, was suddenly invaded by more than ten bandits on the night of the 23rd. They all spoke with a Jiangbei accent, and were carrying handguns, home-made guns, and wooden sticks. Four bandits stood guard outside the door, while the rest entered the house to rob. The robbery lasted for half an hour. They left with their loot with shouts, stealing cash and clothing worth about 200 silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Agricultural Department Concludes Agricultural Survey: The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mining announced that, with the end of the 18th year approaching, the agricultural survey should be concluded promptly. All counties that have not completed the survey must assign additional personnel to the work to ensure its completion as soon as possible. Therefore, yesterday, it specifically developed a work allocation table, which was issued to the heads of the agricultural surveys, who were instructed to depart immediately according to the areas designated in the table for investigation and reporting.</p>
<p>Preparing to Comfort Soldiers at the Front: The Jiangsu Provincial Capital Propaganda Committee held its twelfth meeting at the Provincial Party Department at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. More than twenty representatives from various agencies attended. The meeting was chaired by Lou Xiaochun, representative of the Provincial Party Department, to discuss the method of preparing for the Provincial Capital Circles' Conference to Comfort Soldiers at the Front. The following resolutions were made: (1) Establish the Jiangsu Provincial Capital Circles' Executive Committee to Comfort Soldiers at the Front; (2) The Affairs Committee will be organized by the Secretariat of the Provincial Government, the Provincial Business Rectification Association, and the Provincial Land Bureau; (3) The Entertainment Committee will be organized by the Department of Agriculture and Mining, Zhenjiang High School, Women's Vocational High School, the Provincial Women's Rectification Association, and the Provincial National Arts Hall; (4) The Fundraising Committee will be organized by the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, the Provincial Business Rectification Association, the Provincial Agricultural Rectification Association, the Provincial Party Department, the County Party Department, the Provincial Workers' Rectification Association, the Construction Department, the Police Academy, the Civil Affairs Department, the Zhenjiang Fortress Commander's Office, the County People's Education Hall, and the County Government Finance Department. Each committee will elect one chairman to form the Executive Committee at the meeting; (5) The budget is set at 500 yuan, to be submitted to the Provincial Party Department for transfer to the Provincial Government for allocation.</p>
<p>Citizens of Jintan Present Complaint Against County Magistrate: Yu Zhizhe and other citizens of Jintan County recently submitted a petition to the Provincial Government, stating that Magistrate Yang instigated his cronies to surround the Provincial Committee and abandoned his post, requesting an investigation. After receiving the petition, the Provincial Government ordered the Civil Affairs Department to send personnel to conduct a thorough investigation and report.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Boatmen Detained, Seeking Assistance: The family of Xu Yuantao, a villager in the Yaziqiao Bazhuang area of this county, had several "dan" of wheat stolen by thieves the night before. They immediately reported it to the Public Security Team stationed in the area. Subsequently, Squad Leader Xia of the team discovered more than ten "shi" of wheat and several cloth items on a small boat by the river on the west side of the Sanyi River. According to the boatman, the wheat was picked up daily from the villagers. The squad leader suspected that his actions were suspicious, and he has now been brought to the city. It is reported that the amount of wheat on the boat does not match the amount reported by the victim. Therefore, the boatman believes he was innocently detained and intends to invite many people to the city to voice their grievances and seek assistance.</p>
<p>Detective Team Recovers Kidnapped One-Year-Old: The Zhang family in Luzhu Township was robbed the other day, and their one-year-old child was kidnapped. Now, the County Detective Team has arrested six bandits, including Chen A'san, at the Huacheng Hotel.

<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Various Money Shops Organize a Public Exchange: Gaoyou is a major producing area for rice and wheat. Therefore, no fewer than twenty flour mills from Shanghai, Wuxi, Tong County, etc., have established companies in Gaoyou to collect wheat and conduct business with the money shops. According to regulations, they usually add 7 "li" per tael on Shanghai telegrams. In the past two years, in order to compete for business, various money shops have reduced the rate to as low as 5 "li," often resulting in losses, which has had a significant impact. Therefore, at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, they discussed the method of organizing a public exchange at the Money Trade Association. All wheat company business will be conducted through the public exchange, and the public exchange will distribute the profits to each house according to an agreed-upon ratio, avoiding the impact of competition.

The next morning, when the boat arrived at the south gate of Xinghua, one bandit was left to guard the hostage, while the other bandits went ashore to buy things. Unexpectedly, the bandit guarding the hostage fell asleep in the cabin due to lack of sleep. Wang's younger son seized the opportunity to escape.

<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Yu Xian Defense Corps Captures Bandits: The Yu Xian District of Jiaxing's southern countryside is a place where natives and migrants live together, making it easy for bandits to blend in. Therefore, robbery cases are more frequent in that area than in other places. Recently, farmers in the Tangxi area of the district have been repeatedly robbed. The homes of Huang Jingxiu, Yi Jinhao, He A'san, Lin Dafang, etc., have all been looted, and several people in Yi Jinhao's family were injured by the bandits. The Yu Xian Town Business-run Voluntary Defense Corps learned the other day that the home of Zhu Da'san near Fahua Bridge was suspicious. On the night of the 21st, the Corps dispatched Commander Shen Meishi along with seven squad leaders and corps members, and three police officers from the local Public Security Bureau, to surround Zhu Da'san's home, which was three or four "li" away from the town. They captured four bandits, Zhu Da'san, Pan Xiaomei, Lin A'mei, and Xia A'si. The other five or six people escaped by breaking through the wall and falling into the river. On the spot, they also seized five carved seals of Zhenxing Cocoon Firm from Fahua Bridge, and five pages of envelopes, which were personally identified by Huang Guxiu.

<p>Tasks of the Provincial Inspector in Shangyu: After the County Government reported the kidnapping case at Chunhui Middle School by telegrams, the Provincial Department of Education immediately ordered the security team stationed in Baiguan to cooperate with the County Government's troops to rescue the victims as soon as possible. It also sent Inspector Chen Fuzhang to Shangyu. On the 21st, Chen first went to Chunhui Middle School to inquire with the students who remained on campus about the details of the kidnapping case. On the morning of the 22nd, he visited School Director Wang Jiqing in the city together with Director Che Wuluan of the Education Bureau to discuss school affairs. He then went to visit the family of Fan Shoukang to express condolences. It is learned that Inspector Chen said that the school directors of Chunhui previously gathered to discuss suspending operations and telegraphed the province, stating that they "cannot protect themselves because no one is able to defend themselves." However, most of the students dropped out of school midway and elected representatives to petition the province, which is to be regretted. He speculated that the intention of the school directors was that they feared that similar incidents would continue to occur in the future, and they could not help but worry about them. In reality, that is not the whole story. Chen also said that in his opinion, instead of requesting the official troops to be permanently stationed, it would be better to privately fund the establishment of a security perimeter. The safety of the school would be guaranteed, and the peace of the local area would be maintained.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Deadline for Submitting Construction Bonds: Shaoxing has not submitted a single cent since soliciting provincial construction bonds. Yesterday, the province issued a strict reminder, setting a deadline of the end of June to submit 400,000. Solicitors are now making separate efforts to solicit contributions.</p>
<p>Reduced Amount of Slaughter Tax Still Not Bid On: The annual recognized amount of the Shaoxing slaughter tax was reduced by the County Government to 28,000 yuan. Bidding was solicited on the 23rd, but no one bid.</p>
<p>Discussing the Construction of Roads: The streets from the Dajiang Bridge to the Qingdao Bridge in Shaoxing were previously scheduled by the Construction Bureau to be demolished and vacated by the end of June. Because there were not many craftsmen, the shops requested a delay in the demolition. On the afternoon of the 23rd, the Construction Committee and Standing Committee of the Chamber of Commerce held a meeting at the Construction Bureau. The meeting was chaired by County Magistrate Tang to discuss the phased demolition method. The Commercial Committee and representatives from various shops advocated dividing the area from Dajiang Bridge to Qingdao Bridge into eight sections and demolishing them in eight phases. Each phase would be set at three months. Demolition fees would be limited to the cost of demolition and construction and would be borne by the landlords. After demolition and construction, rent could not be increased. Decoration fees would be borne by the tenants. Land acquisition would be based on the declared price of the land. Road construction fees would be borne by the developers. The Construction Committee advocated dividing the area into two sections and proceeding in phases. Regarding land acquisition, pricing, and demolition compensation, the Construction Committee advocated that the construction costs of the sidewalks would be borne by the business owners, and the road construction fees would be paid from the construction funds. There were no major objections to the road construction project and the sidewalk construction method.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>The Minsheng Cotton Weaving Factory Requests Exemption from the Minor Yarn and Thread Tax: The Provincial Minsheng Cotton Weaving Factory of this county recently submitted a petition to the Construction Department stating that the Pinghu County Unified Tax Bureau, following orders, had taken over the collection of yarn and thread taxes from May 21st, resulting in a sudden increase in the tax amount. It is estimated that the tax is four yuan per yarn piece and fourteen yuan per thread piece. According to the factory's monthly statistics, the factory bears a tax burden of over one hundred yuan, causing considerable concern for its business prospects. Therefore, the factory specifically petitions the Construction Department to consider the difficulties faced by the factory, consult the Finance Department, and quickly grant special accommodations to sustain the factory by exempting the imported yarn and thread needed by the factory from taxation in order to maintain its operations. It is now heard that the Construction Department has consulted the Finance Department for review.</p>
<p>Various Districts Request the Implementation of Price Stabilization Measures: The district chiefs of various districts in this county, due to the soaring rice prices and the difficult living conditions of the poor, have stated that while the opening up of farmers' rice can temporarily alleviate the situation for farmers, small vendors and laborers have no access to farmers' rice and face difficulties in borrowing or obtaining credit. Therefore, they should also be provided with relief measures. They have jointly petitioned the county government to carefully raise funds and promptly implement price stabilization measures to maintain the people's food supply.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Selling Artworks: The City God Temple has a carved gate, exquisitely crafted by clothing workers, with intricate details. The celestial beings are arranged in a display with vivid expressions, each unique, showcasing the marvels of craftsmanship. Past abbots have spared no effort in protecting it, with an estimated value of around ten thousand taels of silver. It is recently heard that the current abbot, Mao Shanqing, since taking office, has failed to uphold religious discipline and has squandered resources recklessly, selling off almost all of the temple's ritual implements. He even secretly transported the gate to Xincang, entrusting someone to sell it at a reduced price. Upon being discovered by local gentry, they are planning to petition the county government to investigate and prohibit the sale in order to protect public artistic assets.</p>
<p>Concubine Commits Suicide, Husband Files Lawsuit: Zhao, the wife of Gai Shuquan of Qitangbang in this city, due to her husband's business in Shanghai, lived alone at home, leading to an adulterous relationship with Wang Jinqing, son of Wang Baoxian, a pediatrician in Ganhe Street. They openly went in and out without any restraint. On the morning of the twenty-second, for some unknown reason, the two had a major quarrel. Jinqing even beat Zhao. Overwhelmed with shame and indignation, Zhao developed a pessimistic outlook on life and swallowed several opium bubbles in an attempt to commit suicide. When her family members noticed, they rushed to call for a doctor, but due to severe poisoning, there was no way to save her, and she died on the spot. It is now heard that Gai Shuquan, believing that Wang Jinqing seduced another man's wife and dared to beat her, forcing her to commit suicide, has already filed a lawsuit with the county government for investigation and punishment.</p>

It was received from the Executive Yuan that Gao Tianmin's complaint against Fang Li, the Magistrate of Pinghu County, had arrived at the Yuan. In addition to the instructions, he should promptly forward the order to the Department of Civil Affairs to thoroughly investigate and handle the matter in order to value people's lives.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan</h3>
<p>Gang Province Bandits Invade Wuyuan: Wuyuan Correspondence: Due to the Communist bandits and Red Army attacking cities and seizing land in the counties of Leping and Dexing in northern Jiangxi, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, local residents are suffering and fleeing to Wuyuan. Wuyuan and Leping-Dexing border each other, and alarming rumors are spreading, causing everyone to feel uneasy. Fortunately, the farmers in the southwest township are inherently strong and have considerable defenses. A People's Self-Defense Corps team is stationed at Taibai Town, a crucial point in Wuyuan opposite the Dexing border, led by Deputy Commander Xia Yumo, who is on alert at all times. A small number of bandits can hardly invade the border, so they can live in peace. A few days ago (15th), a group of hundreds of bandits, with red cloths wrapped around their heads and waists, lingered around Haikou. After discovering that a self-defense corps was stationed in Taibai, they quietly crossed the river at Shuidong Maichai Wharf late at night. After landing, they first guarded the crucial road in and out of Shitadun. After everyone had crossed, they organized their troops and rushed into Zhucun in the western township. The village initially wanted to resist, but was defeated by the superior number of bandits, resulting in two villagers being injured and killed. The rich man Peng Jiao in the village was captured and extorted for property. Unable to find anything after a thorough search, Peng and his son were taken away. Upon hearing the alarm, neighboring villages immediately sounded gongs and united farmers and hunters from various villages, together with hundreds of members of the West Township Nangang Self-Defense Corps and the Leping Duanjiacun Guard Corps, to track down and pursue the bandits. The bandits, reaching near Xiangcun, saw more than a dozen luggage trucks transporting goods from Leping to Wuyuan. Suspecting them to be valuables, they abandoned Peng and others and looted the trucks. The self-defense corps and hunters arrived and immediately surrounded and launched a fierce attack. The bandits, lacking guns and ammunition, suffered more than a hundred casualties at that time. Only a dozen or so escaped, and the rest were captured. According to their confessions, there are still 300 bandits hiding in Luozhu Mountain, hoping to launch a major offensive. Xia Yumo, commander of the Self-Defense Corps stationed in Taibai, was alarmed and sent two plainclothes scouts to investigate. They were discovered by the bandit scouts, and one was hacked to death, while the other's whereabouts are unknown. Xia, knowing that something had happened because the scout had not returned after the deadline, yesterday, together with Zhu Songshan, captain of the county police reserve team, led the entire team from Xucun Zhongyun, and gathered hundreds of farmers, hunters, and guards from various villages in the southwest to rush to Luozhu Mountain and join forces to suppress the bandits. Luozhu Mountain spans dozens of miles, bordering Wuyuan, Leping, and Fuliang counties, with deep valleys and dense forests, which have always been a den for bandits. They are currently encircling the mountain, and it is expected that they will be able to capture and destroy them in one fell swoop. (June 17th)</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Zhongda Students Strive for Funding</h3>
<p>Yesterday They Petitioned the Yuan and Ministry</p>
<p>| 3 Million Yuan for the Nineteenth Year |</p>
<p>Central University student representatives Zhang Zhenyu, Zhao Zhongling, He Zhengsen, Li Jiefei, Cheng Fang, Chen Yuezhong, Chang Renxia, and others, due to the issue of the school's funding being cut, went to the Ministry of Education, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance to petition, requesting an increase in funding for the nineteenth year to 3 million yuan for development. Yesterday at 2 pm, they first went to the Ministry of Education to petition. Minister Jiang personally received them and said that Central University is located in the capital and has a major mission, so it should do its best to develop. 3 million yuan is not too much, but due to the current financial constraints, there are many inconveniences, which he regrets. As for 2.04 million yuan, he will do his best to allocate it and will also raise the representatives' request for 3 million yuan at the Executive Yuan meeting. Then they went to the Executive Yuan to petition. Premier Tan was away on official business, so Secretary-General Zhu received them. The representatives explained in detail the need for 3 million in funding. Zhu then accepted the petition and promised to forward it to Premier Tan. Later, they went to the Ministry of Finance. Because the minister and vice-minister were in Shanghai on official business, Director-General Ye received them. He accepted the petition that day and promised to forward it to Minister Song for an increase. The petition is recorded below:</p>
<p>Petition for Central University to urgently develop, please confirm the budget for the nineteenth year to be 3 million yuan to facilitate progress and benefit the party and the country. We students are studying at the National Central University, witnessing the importance of the school's affairs and the exhaustion of school funds. For the sake of our own studies and for the sake of national culture, we have repeatedly submitted petitions to the Ministry of Education in June and July of last year requesting that the school's funding be set at 3 million yuan and that it be effectively guaranteed. The reasons and methods are on file. However, due to financial constraints, it was not realized. The Executive Yuan only decided to allocate 1.92 million yuan for the eighteenth year, and the Finance Committee recently discussed reducing it to 1.8 million yuan. Hearing this news, we are extremely worried. Now the eighteenth year is coming to an end, and the nineteenth year is about to begin. We have heard that the Ministry of Education has approved the school's budget for 2.04 million yuan, which is still far from what we have submitted. We believe that Central University is a capital university and has a major mission in culture and academics. In recent years, when hiring teachers, most have given up and gone elsewhere because the treatment is not as good as other places. In addition, books, instruments, and various equipment are also simplified due to financial difficulties. In terms of the name of the National Central University, both material and spirit are lacking. Moreover, the price of gold has soared, and prices have risen sharply, increasing various expenses. However, the budget revenue is only this amount. How can it adapt to the times and show the country? In order to develop school affairs and contribute to the party and the country, we hereby publicly request the Yuan and Ministry to confirm the school's budget for the nineteenth year to be 3 million yuan (and also request to forward it to the Executive Yuan and consult the Ministry of Finance and the Finance Committee) and allocate it in full to facilitate progress. We also request instructions for compliance, which is for the public good. Respectfully presented to Tan, the Premier of the Executive Yuan, Jiang, the Minister of Education, and Song, the Minister of Finance. Respectfully presented by the Student Union of National Central University.</p>
<h3>Restoration of the Beautiful Sounds of Ancient Chinese Music</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education Assists the Datong Society in Making Musical Instruments</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, according to Li Yuying, Cai Yuanpei, Chu Minyi, and Wang Xiaolai, executive committee members and head of affairs, and Zheng Jinwen, executive committee member and head of music, presented a petition for allocating old wood stored in the Antiquities Preservation Institute to manufacture complete sets of ancient and modern musical instruments. The history of Chinese music is long and the production is complete, which is unique in the world. It has special advantages in education and art. In terms of orchestras, it is said that there were more than 800 people in the Rao Ge, and more than 1,000 people in the Zhong Hao Le, Dan Bi Le, and Yan Xiang Le. In terms of musical instruments, there are more than 200 types in twelve categories: metal, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, earth, leather, wood, snake, reed, bristle, and shell. However, in the era of autocracy, various types of grand music were not publicly learned, and few people learned them. They gradually declined, and the national music inherited by society today is only a few types of stringed instruments. The scale is small, and the instruments are inferior. Compared with Western music, it is of course not enough to compete, which makes the country suffer the slander of having no music. In fact, the true face of national music is not like this. If it is sorted out in time, it may not be possible to restore the old view. For this reason, colleagues organized the Rentong Music Society in Shanghai in the ninth year of the Republic of China, gathering comrades to study and sort out the methods of national music. In the past ten years, the achievements that can be said have been the publication of the History of Chinese Music, clarifying the origin and flow of national music, manufacturing more than 50 kinds of imitation ancient musical instruments, expanding the scope of national music, compiling various ancient music to improve the art of national music, and preparing for sorting out national music. Sorting out national music should be the most urgent task of manufacturing musical instruments. There are now more than 140 kinds of Chinese musical instruments that can be imitated with diagrams. The association originally planned to manufacture seven complete sets of musical instruments, which will be displayed in educational and cultural institutions in the capital and various ports and distributed to Europe and the United States to promote them. However, the materials for musical instruments are more valuable when they are old. The old wood stored in the Nanjing Antiquities Preservation Institute is piled up in the open air and allowed to rot, which is a great pity. If it is used to manufacture musical instruments, it will be most appropriate to use the beautiful materials that are about to be destroyed to revitalize the cause of culture. Recently, the Ministry sent a letter instructing the association to send personnel to the institute to select the wood and instructed to make one more set for display in the Central Education Museum, which shows the Ministry's intention to promote national music. I hereby attach a list of the total wood materials needed to manufacture eight sets of musical instruments, which is 2,208 feet of wood with a width of one foot and a thickness of four inches, and request that you examine and verify it. I also beg you to order the Antiquities Preservation Institute to cooperate with Zheng Yusun, the director of the association, to select the wood suitable for manufacturing musical instruments and issue it according to the list so that it can be manufactured as soon as possible. The future of culture depends on it. Respectfully presented to the Ministry of Education by the Datong Music Association. (The musical instruments to be manufactured are the seven-stringed zither, the fifty-stringed Paoxi Se, the twenty-five-stringed Song Se, the fifteen-stringed zheng, the seventy-two-stringed large konghou, pipa, zhu, yu, revolving palace instrument, zhunqin, drums, and other musical instruments from Manchuria, Mongolia, Hui, and Tibet.) The Ministry of Education approved the association's submission in full. The association's research on ancient music to restore the old view has been established for ten years. All the publications, imitations, arrangements, and exercises have been very successful and commendable. The preservation, sorting, and improvement of ancient Chinese music depend on this research work. The request to allocate the old wood stored in the Ministry's Antiquities Preservation Institute to manufacture ancient and modern musical instruments is feasible. You should go and accept it and report it. The Antiquities Preservation Institute should also say, according to the Datong Music Association's request to allocate the stored old wood to manufacture musical instruments, the various items in the association's submission are feasible. In addition to the instructions, the original submission and attached list are copied and sent to you for issuance in full. You should report the issuance situation for the record.</p>

Formulate Methods for Sending Students to Study in the East and West Oceans: The Interim Regulations for Selecting and Sending Students to Study Abroad in this Province have been formulated and submitted to the Provincial Government for approval and implementation. Due to the province's financial difficulties, the selection and sending have not yet been implemented. Therefore, the Director will, within the possible range of financial resources, formulate implementation measures based on the regulations and submit them to the Provincial Government for approval. C. Formulate Subsidies for Students Studying Outside the Province: For subsidizing students studying outside the province, Hubei, Anhui, Guangxi, Fujian, and other provinces have detailed regulations and provisions. The general budget of education funds in this province has always included a subsidy for students studying at Nanyang University and other schools. For several years, there has been no expenditure in the final accounts. It is now proposed to formulate subsidy measures for students studying outside the province in conjunction with the Finance Department, with detailed provisions for the number of schools and subsidy methods to benefit the poor scholars and create new talents. D. Ban Private Vocational Schools and Above: The Regulations and Organization Law of Universities and the Regulations and Organization Law of Vocational Schools were promulgated by the Ministry of Education last year and have been circulated for compliance. If private universities and vocational schools in this province do not comply with the regulations and organization law, it is proposed that the inspectors thoroughly investigate and strictly prohibit them before the summer vacation this year to emphasize the law.</p>
<p>Fourth (Social Education) A. Implementation of Literacy Movement: The Literacy Movement has been stipulated by the Central Party Department as one of the grassroots tasks of party committees at all levels, and the Ministry of Education has issued an outline of the Literacy Movement propaganda plan, which has been repeatedly ordered to be implemented by counties, cities, and secondary schools, and a plan for the implementation of mass education has been prepared and submitted to the government for approval and promulgation. It is now proposed to implement the various plans according to the original plan within the limits of what can be done, in order to increase the people's wisdom and cultivate the foundation of the country. B. Promotion of Public Schools: The outline of the methods for public schools was promulgated by the Ministry of Education in February last year and has been circulated to counties and cities for compliance. These schools are designed to help illiterate adults. The methods require little cost but are of great benefit. The Department plans to formulate detailed promotion methods based on the outline and issue them to counties and cities with a deadline for compliance and reporting. C. Promoting Agricultural, Commercial, and Industrial Vocational Supplementary Schools: The number of graduates and achievements of short-term supplementary schools for agricultural, commercial, and industrial personnel should be reported one month after the end of each semester. This has been ordered by the Ministry of Education and has been distributed for compliance. It is now found that most counties and cities have not established these supplementary schools and should be urged to do so. The Department plans to formulate assessment methods and issue them to counties and cities with a deadline for implementation in order to promote agricultural, commercial, and industrial supplementary education effectively. D. Situation of Social Education in Other Counties and Cities: It was previously ordered to fill in and report separately according to the social education survey form issued by the Ministry. It is now found that the counties and cities that have been held are more popular with popular newspapers and magazines, general libraries, popular libraries, and public schools, and parks and public sports fields are second. Other social education undertakings have not been actively implemented. It is now proposed to stipulate methods within the financial resources and needs of each locality during this period. Those that have been held should be effectively rectified by the provincial inspectors in conjunction with local education administrative personnel, and those that have not been held should be urged to hold them in order to supplement the inadequacy of school education.</p>
<p>Fifth (Education Funds) A. Detailed Review of the Education Fund Budget for the Nineteenth Year: The budget books for the nineteenth year compiled by provincial schools and educational organizations should be carefully assessed by the Department, compiled into the total education fund budget for the nineteenth year, and verified.</p>
<p>Sixth (Educational Administration in Various Counties and Cities) A. Investigate the Education Directors of Various Counties and Cities and Strictly Verify Their Qualifications: The Education Directors of various counties and cities assist the county magistrate or mayor and generally oversee the schools under their jurisdiction. The responsibilities are heavy. The Director's qualifications and appointment procedures have certain regulations. It is now found that some Education Directors in various counties and cities are not qualified and are appointed arbitrarily, and some are qualified but have not yet submitted a report for verification and appointment in accordance with the regulations. The Department plans to formulate an investigation form and distribute it to the counties and cities with a deadline for filling in and reporting for assessment. B. Circulate Orders to Various Counties and Cities to Report on the Educational Administration Work Plan: The local financial resources and various environments of each county and city are different. Regarding educational administration, it is necessary to compile a complete plan according to the local conditions in order to promote it without hindrance. In order to assess the educational administration work plan of the province, it is proposed to order the counties and cities to divide the educational administration work into four phases each year and prepare a plan in January, April, July, and October and submit the plan to the Department for review in order to supervise and guide it and achieve the effect of mutual assistance. C. Circulate Orders to Various Counties and Cities to Report on the Educational Administration Work Report: Since the administrative plans of various counties and cities are compiled and reported in phases, it is necessary to assess in detail whether they can be held in turn during the period and whether they are making every effort to promote them. In order to understand the educational administration situation of the province, it is proposed to order the counties and cities to report the progress of the educational administration work at the end of each month for review in order to assess them.</p>

<h3>Recovering Telephone Rights in the Concessions</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications Actively Advocates</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association Works Hard to Implement</p>
<p>Chinese Shareholders Should Not Be Fooled</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association received an urgent telegram from the Ministry of Communications yesterday: "To the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association: The telegrams should have arrived. I have read the reports in Shen Xin and other newspapers on the 21st, which contained letters from the China and Foreign Telephone Company to its shareholders and users, arguing about the sale of old shares and the increase in rental fees. In fact, the so-called new company hopes to obtain net profit, and has not reduced it slightly. The price of the issued shares is still lower than the current market price. It is falsely claimed that the capital will not be increased, but the price of automatic machine materials is not reduced. Instead, it exploits the old shares, and occupies and infringes on our country's sovereignty for as long as 40 years, and does not mention a word, in order to deceive our Chinese businessmen and make them fooled. Our Ministry advocates actively recovering the rights, in accordance with the party's platform and policies, safeguarding sovereignty, and seeking the welfare of businessmen and people. The original plan was to allow the original Chinese shares to be exchanged for cash or converted into new shares at the market price after the takeover as commercial shares. For the original foreign shares, our government or Chinese businessmen will recover them. As for the future operating prices, we only seek to maintain the prosperity of the business and the interests of the commercial shares. I hereby send another telegram to your association, please explain in detail to the Chinese businessmen holding the shares, so that they know that supporting our ministry's recovery is to assist the government in recovering national rights, and supporting the sale to foreign businessmen is to lose sovereignty and increase restrictions. Rise up and work together, do not be fooled by foreign businessmen, and hope to awaken the public to work together to fight for it. This is my sincere hope. Printed by the Ministry of Communications." The association immediately replied by telegram, "To the Ministry of Communications of the Nanjing National Government: I have received your telegrams. We admire your great efforts to seek the integrity of national sovereignty and to take care of the welfare of businessmen and people, and to recover the telephone rights in the concessions. We will do our best to assist you. The association believes that on the one hand, the approval rights for the exclusive operation of telephones in the concessions should be declared to be recovered by the Ministry, and on the other hand, the detailed methods for purchasing the equipment at a reserve price should be announced, so that the new company will not dare to purchase it lightly, and the Chinese and foreign shareholders of the Shanghai China and Foreign Telephone Company will also know that the share rights are guaranteed and the capital will not be lost. They will definitely agree, and the users, because they know that the future operating prices will only seek to maintain the prosperity of the business and the interests of the commercial shares, will be more optimistic about its success. We hereby reply to the telegram. Chairman Wang Xiaolai and Xu Jiqing of the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association, respectfully."</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing and others also received a telegram from Minister Wang, saying, "To Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Qian Xinzhi, Wu Yunzhai, Zhao Jinqing, Zhang Gongquan, Li Zuyu, Yang Xingfo, Pan Gongzhan, Chen Dezheng, and Wang Zhiwei: I have checked the case of negotiating the recovery of the Shanghai concession telephone. Our Ministry has also handled it jointly with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Chinese groups, and it has been going on for a long time. Now, the Chinese and foreign companies are blatantly ignoring it and have decided to hold a special shareholders meeting on the 27th to prepare to sell it to foreign businessmen, and have issued notices, making various arguments, and publishing them in newspapers to deceive shareholders and users and achieve their desires. The concession telephone is related to sovereignty. Once it is lost, we must endure foreign control for as long as 40 years, or even never recover it. As for the rights of businessmen and people, they are most valued by the party and the country. The original plan of our Ministry was to allow the old Chinese shares to be exchanged for cash or converted into new shares at the market price after the takeover as commercial shares. As for the old foreign shares, the Chinese businessmen will be specially allowed to recover them, or the government will buy them. As for the future operating prices, we only seek to maintain the prosperity of the business and the interests of the commercial shares, which is not comparable to the foreign businessmen who only seek profits. Now the time is urgent and the situation is critical. You have always had high hopes, so I hereby send a telegram to earnestly request you to unite and explain in detail the pros and cons to the Chinese businessmen holding the shares, and urge them to attend the shareholders meeting and jointly oppose the sale to foreign businessmen. I also hope that you will widely publicize it to the public, so as to achieve the goal of recovery and save sovereignty. This is my sincere hope." Wang Boqun.</p>

<h3>Special Alert in West Shanghai</h3>
<p>Ren Luping, the district chief of the 6th district of the Public Security Bureau in Caojiadu, West Shanghai, announced a special alert at 5:00 p.m. yesterday (the 24th). In addition to ordering the police stations under his jurisdiction on Route President, Guangfu Road, Singapore Road, etc., to strengthen their defenses, he specially ordered Inspector Wang Yaolu to lead three platoons of police officers to be stationed at Wujiaochang, and ordered each patrol leader to lead several police officers to patrol and inspect along Route President, Great Western Road, and Avenue Paul Brunat.

<h3>Three Million US Dollars</h3>
<p>US Warship Transported...Headed North Yesterday</p>
<p>Asked About Its Purpose...Unwilling to Answer</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that the US destroyer USS Smith Thompson, carrying about three million US dollars, entered Wusong from Manila at 5:00 p.m. yesterday (the 23rd). At that time, precautions were taken to prevent accidents. At 5:00 a.m. this morning, it sailed to Qingdao, Yantai, and Dagu to unload the gold coins it was carrying. When people on the ship were asked about the purpose of transporting these gold coins, they were all unwilling to answer. Only one senior officer said that because the price of silver in China has fallen sharply recently, the authorities believe that salaries should be paid in gold coins. As for whether this matter is related to the Tianjin Customs, they do not know.</p>
<h3>Wu Liande's Anti-Epidemic Talk</h3>
<p>Talking to the Reporter of the North China Daily News</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that Dr. Wu Liande, the director of national seaport quarantine, had just returned to Shanghai after accompanying Dr. Burke of the Health Department of the League of Nations to inspect the quarantine offices in Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, and other ports. The reporter met with Mr. Wu yesterday (the 23rd) and talked about the quarantine administration. According to reports, the national seaport quarantine affairs are now under the control of the Ministry of Health. He has been hired as the director of national seaport quarantine and the chief technician of the Ministry of Health to start reorganization. The quarantine of each port has been handled by the customs, without medical experts to preside over the overall situation, so the results are quite difficult to satisfy. Recently, the customs authorities requested the central government to select experts to take charge of important positions, so the first step was to take over the Shanghai port quarantine affairs. At present, Dr. Edward, the original medical officer of the Wusong Quarantine Office, is still working there, and four Chinese doctors have been hired to assist him, all under his control. He hopes to improve the Shanghai port first, and then take over the northern ports, and then the southern ones. Now Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, and other ports have close relations with Singapore, Java, the Philippines, and other places. Every year, no less than 500,000 overseas Chinese go abroad from these three ports. At present, these people must pay a doctor's examination fee and obtain a certificate before boarding the ship. However, the doctor's examination is often only in name, so many overseas Chinese are refused entry to other countries' ports due to illness. Therefore, it is planned to set up a proper isolation and quarantine center after taking over Xiamen and Shantou, and first let the overseas Chinese enter the center for examination for a few days before starting the journey to avoid the suffering of being detained and examined again after reaching their destination. It is also said that the Wusong Quarantine Hospital is old and unsuitable for use. This year, a new quarantine center will be built with 250,000 yuan, which is expected to provide considerable convenience for accommodating infected people and handling ship disinfection. The office has generously borrowed houses from the customs to set up an office on the fourth floor of the Jianghai Customs Building, and has now formulated the latest quarantine regulations based on the 1926 International Health Convention, which will be implemented throughout the country. The office cooperates closely with the Health Department of the League of Nations. Dr. Burke, an expert sent by the League of Nations, stayed in Shanghai for two months to help him draft the regulations, and went to Singapore a few days ago to prepare for the exchange of seaport health, which will be inspected by representatives from countries along the Pacific in July and August this year. In addition, the office can also be used as a general summary of plague news. The special municipal health bureau and the health offices of the two concessions cooperate fully with the office, and the handling of epidemic prevention affairs is more coordinated than in previous years. As for the epidemic prevention work in the three northeastern provinces, it may be more tense this year, because the plague in the area often rages once every ten years, but the epidemic prevention personnel are well prepared and are in contact with the Siberian health personnel.</p>

Yesterday, Shanghai shipping merchants received another telegram saying that the sea ships Zhou Yu, Fushen, Haishun, Huaheng Huaping, Beichang, Guangda, and Huaxing, which had previously stopped operating, will return to Shanghai immediately. The Zhaoxing ship cannot go to sea, so it will be replaced by the Yuxing ship and released. The Wanxiang ship needs urgent repairs, and another telegram has been sent to the Sanbei Company to send someone to pick it up. It is expected that another eleven sea ships will be released in the next two days.</p>
<p>Fujian Merchants Telegraph for Shipping Routes to Shanghai and Fujian to Resume. There were originally four Chinese ships operating on the Shanghai-Fujian route, but since the suspension of operations, it has been more than two months, and no ships have been operating, resulting in tens of thousands of boxes of accumulated jasmine and new tea in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Fuzhou merchants sent an urgent telegram to Shanghai, saying that the overall situation in Fujian is stable and ships are needed to transport goods, and ordered to send ships to resume operations immediately to prevent the monopoly of Japanese ships. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other shipping companies in the local area have urgently dispatched Jiahe and other ships to officially resume operations.</p>
<p>Shanghai and Guangdong to Resume Operations Soon. In the past month, the Nanhai Shipping industry of Shanghai foreign shipping companies has developed to the extreme. Almost every British and Japanese ship sailing to Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangdong is fully loaded, mainly with miscellaneous grains, fabrics, and earth cloth. The water freight income of each ship is always above ten thousand taels. Yesterday, Shanghai shipping merchants learned that the second batch of sea ships will arrive in Shanghai soon. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other companies have decided to restore the Nanhua shipping route first in order to save shipping rights. It has been decided to officially restore the Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangdong routes starting next week.</p>
<p>Dalian Needs Ships Even More Urgently. For more than a month, no Chinese ships have sailed to Dalian. The beans and miscellaneous grains stored in the port and transported to Shanghai are accumulating more and more. Recently, it was learned that most of the sea ships have returned to Shanghai. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Zhaoxing Company, and other companies have received telegrams from Dalian urging them to send ships to transport goods. The companies have been planning this yesterday. At least four or five ships will be sailing to Dalian next week.</p>
<p>Five Sea Ships to Be Delayed. It was learned yesterday that the rental ships are still needed and cannot be released for operation immediately. It has been agreed that the five ships are Tongli, Dazhong, Taishun, Huayang, and Yuxing. Another ship, the Sheng'an, of the Sanbei Company, has been temporarily transferred to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Shipping News</h3>
<p>Dalian Reassigned to South Manchuria Railway for Direct Operation. The Dalian Steamship Company, a Japanese company, was originally an affiliated business of the South Manchuria Railway to facilitate water and land transportation and develop its railway freight and passenger business. Since it was changed to an independent company two years ago, although it is different in name, all its business plans are still under the jurisdiction of the South Manchuria Railway. On the 20th of this month, Mr. Sengoku, the president of the South Manchuria Railway, proposed a reorganization plan to abolish the independent business nature of the South Manchuria Hotel, Dalian Steamship Company, and Manchuria Shipyard, which are related to the South Manchuria Railway, and put them under the joint jurisdiction of the South Manchuria Railway. The hotel will be managed by the Passenger Section of the South Manchuria Railway, and the Dalian Steamship Company and Manchuria Shipyard will set up a separate Shipping Department as the general management agency. This matter has been generally agreed and will be implemented in September this year. The current president of the Dalian Steamship Company will be transferred to the general manager of the Shipping Department. According to the news from the Shanghai branch, this matter has absolutely no relationship with the business and the specifics of the company, but only the subordination issue has been slightly changed. The new Shanghai-Dalian passenger ship Qingdao Maru, which was built by the company, can be sailed in September.</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Negotiate the Transportation of Piece Goods to Tianjin. Yesterday, there were more than 700 pieces of piece goods transported by Chinese merchants to Tianjin. Because they were afraid of paying double taxes upon arrival in Tianjin, the cargo owners temporarily withdrew and stopped loading when the goods had already been loaded on the ship. At 4:00 p.m. yesterday, the piece goods merchants in this port sent a special telegram to Tianjin to inquire whether Chinese merchants' piece goods can be picked up according to the red list when they arrive in Tianjin. If it can be facilitated, they will be loaded immediately, otherwise they will be stopped.</p>
<h3>Repatriation Bonds to Be Repaid on Time</h3>
<p>Lottery to Be Held in Shanghai on July 10</p>
<p>The local agencies and organizations in this port received a letter from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating that the third lottery for the repayment of the Repatriation Bonds will be held at the Shanghai Bankers Association at 2:00 p.m. on July 10.

<h3>General Assembly of the French Business Water and Electricity Union</h3>
<p>The French Business Water and Electricity Union and all workers held their third general assembly at the Public Sports Ground at around 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Xu Yefu was sent by the Municipal Training Association to attend and provide guidance, and the Second District General Office of the Public Security Bureau also ordered many police officers to go to maintain order. Chairman Xu Amei and Recorder Zhang Qixiang discussed the matters of the factory hiring workers to repair the water pipes at the South Railway Station the day before and Chen Qiaosong inciting workers to prevent labor movement, etc., and temporarily issued a notice ordering workers to strictly guard against reactionary elements taking the opportunity to confuse them during the strike. Finally, they discussed the issue of relocating the venue, because the current union address is far away from the municipal department and the Social Affairs Bureau, and it is extremely inconvenient to contact matters, and there are delays in the delivery of official documents. It is proposed to set up a temporary office near the Old West Gate to facilitate contact at any time and avoid delays in work.</p>
<h3>Song Army Stationed at Wangjiangjing Temple</h3>
<p>The Naval Hospital in Zhanghuabang South, Wusong, is now planned to be converted into a wounded soldiers' hospital, with 500 wounded soldiers arriving in Song in the next few days. For the sake of local peace, the Wusong authorities and municipal authorities specially requested Xiong Kexi, the battalion commander of the First Battalion of the Fifth Division of the Song Garrison, to send troops to guard and protect local safety. Because there are no suitable houses in the Zhanghuabang area, Tang Zhanzhi, a municipal commissioner, Zheng Shushan, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, accompanied Xiong Kexi, the battalion commander, to look for houses at Wangjiangjing Temple at the intersection of Jungong Road on the south bank of Yuncaobang Bridge at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. The houses are spacious and can accommodate a company of infantry, and the location is the main road to the entrance of Songzhen. Once troops are stationed there, bandits will not dare to invade, and the residents of Songzhen can live and work in peace.</p>
<h3>News of Airmail Service Between Beijing and Shanghai</h3>

<h3>Summer Cocoons from Zhejiang Start Shipping to Shanghai</h3>
<p>This year's summer cocoons produced in various parts of Zhejiang Province have now entered the market, with Gongchen, Yuhang, Chang'an, Haining, Xucun, and other places being the earliest. Purchasing began the day before yesterday, but because the producers in the villages are unwilling to sell at low prices, cocoon merchants are finding it difficult to buy goods. They were forced to raise their bids, increasing the price by seventy yuan per dan (unit of weight), which is thirty percent higher than the price of spring cocoons. Yesterday, the first batch of summer cocoons was transported to Shanghai via the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Huitong Transport Company at the Chang'an Station. According to reports, G順增 Cocoon Firm transported 107 packages of summer cocoons to Shanghai Tianchang Silk Factory, and Xieyuan Cocoon Firm transported 121 packages of summer cocoons to Shanghai Lichang Silk Factory. All arrived at the South Station and were unloaded. The cocoon tax inspection committee stationed at the station, along with customs officials, inspected, verified, weighed, and released the goods. It is reported that the total number of summer cocoons transported this year is expected to be thirteen to fourteen thousand packages.</p>
<h3>Survey Form for Foreign Passengers Entering and Leaving on Steamships</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Sends a Letter Requesting Instructions for Filling out the Form</p>
<p>Previously, in order to compile statistics on foreign passengers entering and leaving on steamships, the Municipal Government requested the Jiangsu Diplomatic Office to send letters to the consulates, requesting them to instruct their respective shipping companies to fill out passenger entry and exit registration forms. However, a long time has passed, and except for the United States and Germany, no one has complied. The Municipal Government has sent letters to Mr. Blix, the British Consul-General, Mr. Koechlin, the French Consul-General, and Mr. Shigemitsu Mamoru, the Japanese Consul-General, requesting them to instruct their respective shipping companies to fill out the forms by a specific date. The original letter is as follows: "Regarding the passenger entry and exit registration survey form, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has specially dispatched the Jiangsu Diplomatic Office to send letters on file. According to a report from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Consuls-General of the United States and Germany have replied, agreeing to comply. However, the Consuls of Britain, France, and Japan have not yet made any response. Please forward a letter to urge them to fill out the forms as soon as possible for statistical purposes. In addition to separate letters, we hereby send this letter for your reference. Please forward it to your respective shipping companies and instruct them to fill out the forms according to the previously sent forms by a specific date. This is an important matter, and we look forward to your reply."</p>

<h3>Wage Increase Case Still Unresolved</h3>
<p>Labor Side to Hold Meeting Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Consular Corps in Shanghai held a joint meeting the day before yesterday regarding the wage increase request made by the Jianghai seamen. Although a concrete solution was discussed, it has not yet been fully resolved because the labor groups have not unanimously approved it. Currently, the Jianghai Public Association and others have scheduled a joint labor meeting for tomorrow (the 26th) at 3:00 PM to discuss a resolution. A practical solution can only be reached after this meeting.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Telephone Bureau to Replace Automatic Exchange</h3>

The Bureau's engineering department has begun planning the replacement of the exchange lines. It is reported that the second batch could have arrived in Shanghai soon, but because the storage warehouses in Pudong and Zhabei have not yet been completed, there is no place to store the goods after they arrive in Shanghai. Therefore, a telegram was sent to the U.S. factory yesterday, instructing them to postpone the shipment.</p>
<p>Municipal Government</p>
<h3>Explanation of Employee Dismissal Procedures</h3>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Sends a Letter to Inform Various Trade Associations</p>
<p>Although the labor regulations of this city were promulgated long ago, many merchants still do not have a deep understanding of the employee dismissal procedures. The Chamber of Commerce specially sent a letter to inform the various trade associations of the explanation it received from the Municipal Government. The original letter is as follows: "Regarding the previous inquiry from the vegetable and fruit industry about how to change the practice of dismissing employees during festivals after the abolition of the lunar calendar, we have requested instructions. We received a reply from the Social Affairs Bureau stating that since there are relevant regulations for employee dismissal, there is no need to set dates based on commercial customs. We then inquired with the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau whether the so-called relevant regulations could be applied to the dismissal of factory workers according to the provisions of Chapter 6 of the Factory Law, and whether the dismissal procedures for store employees and factories not subject to the Factory Law should be handled according to the provisions of Section 7 of the Civil Code's Obligations section on employment. We received instructions from the Municipal Government stating that the Social Affairs Bureau's opinion is that Section 7 of the Civil Code's Obligations section on employment can be applied, but if there are individual contracts between labor and management, the contract should be followed, and if there are collective labor agreements, the labor agreement should be followed. If there are no provisions in the labor agreement or contract, the Factory Law and the city's labor regulations should be consulted and handled separately. The Chamber of Commerce then stated that the so-called consultation and separate handling according to the Factory Law and the city's labor regulations, if referring to stores and factories not subject to the Factory Law, would contradict the statement that Section 7 of the Civil Code's Obligations section on employment can be applied. We sent another letter requesting instructions. On the 9th of this month, we received instructions from the Municipal Government stating that the Social Affairs Bureau's opinion is that the Factory Law is a special law, and the Civil Code is a general law. According to the general rules for applying laws, if the special law is not applicable, the general law should be applied. Therefore, the previous explanation that Section 7 of the Civil Code's Obligations section on employment can be applied specifically refers to factories and stores not subject to the Factory Law. As for the second half of the previous explanation, if there are no provisions in the labor agreement or contract, the Factory Law and the city's labor regulations should be consulted and handled separately. It did not explicitly state that there is no need to apply the various articles of Section 7 of the Civil Code's Obligations section. Therefore, the two sections of the previous explanation do not contradict each other and do not violate the general rules for applying laws. Moreover, the city's labor regulations have been approved by the National Government and are suitable for the times and local conditions. Therefore, they should be consulted and handled in conjunction with the Factory Law and cannot be compared to the application of the Civil Code. Even for factories and stores not subject to the Factory Law, Section 7 of the Civil Code's Obligations section can be applied. However, Article 488 of the Civil Code clearly stipulates that employment can be terminated when the term expires, and employment without a fixed term can be terminated at any time. Article 3 of the city's temporary regulations on employee treatment stipulates that when the employment contract expires, the employer should list the names of employees they do not wish to continue employing and the reasons for not renewing the contract and report them to the Social Affairs Bureau for record. It seems reasonable to refer to this for handling. Also, according to Article 489 of the Civil Code, if one party encounters a significant reason, the employment contract, even if it has a fixed term, can still be terminated before the term expires. What exactly constitutes a significant reason, and how to terminate it before the term expires, cannot but be determined based on local conditions. Therefore, the provisions of Articles 6 and 8 of the city's temporary regulations on employee retirement benefits and Article 16 of the temporary regulations on employee service do not conflict with the principles of the Civil Code, and their methods are more useful for reference. In short, the provisions of the law are limited, and the changes in personnel are infinite. The key is to adapt to local conditions and not violate reason. In the current situation of industrial and commercial decline and excess labor, it is necessary to consider both sides and reduce disputes. We have discussed the above for your reference to see if it is appropriate. We hope you will review and instruct us to comply." Based on this, the various sections of the Social Affairs Bureau's discussion are appropriate. In addition to instructions, we hope you will comply.</p>
<h3>Declaration of the Steamship Carpentry Workers' Union</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Steamship Carpentry Workers' Union Warns Contractors to Stop Delaying Wage Increases and Inciting Strikes: We, the Zhejiang and Guangdong carpenters and joiners on steamships, totaling over 1,500 people, have unfortunately been working under the contractor system, acting as mobile casual workers. All daily necessities, food, and lodging expenses must be borne by ourselves. In this era of expensive rice and firewood, how can we maintain our livelihood with our hard-earned wages? Therefore, at the request of the workers, our union proposed amendments to the treatment conditions in August last year, submitted them to the Municipal Training Council for review and correction, and then sent them to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for approval. On November 13th of last year, our union printed and sent the proposed changes to all contractors in the factories, requesting them to accept them and set January 1st of this year as the date for implementation and wage increases. We immediately published statements of reasons in the Min Shen Xin and Zi Lin newspapers. Because the labor and management of a part of our union's Zhejiang members had already signed a draft agreement, acknowledging the wage increase, it was necessary to wait for the contractors of the other Zhejiang members to agree to the increase before both sides could increase wages uniformly. Unfortunately, the Guangdong contractors, totaling more than 20 companies, each acted independently and had no contact with each other. Only the most powerful Guang Fu Chang, Hai Ji, Yi Xing, Qi Xiang, Guang Sen Chang, Zuo Xing, and Tong Li formed a private (Jiyi Association), which was financially powerful and controlled all rights. The other contractors followed the lead of the Jiyi Association. Therefore, the wage increase issue and all matters were controlled by the Jiyi Association. Unexpectedly, two or three unscrupulous elements, relying on imperialism as their shield, obstructed the process, causing the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's multiple mediations to be stalled by their cunning means, resulting in a stalemate. We were forced to petition the Mayor to allow arbitration. Unexpectedly, during this period, Guang Fu Chang dismissed workers in the middle of the night, Hai Ji also dismissed a large number of workers, and Yi Xing also dismissed a large number of long-term workers, wantonly destroying regulations and oppressing workers. This was adding fuel to the fire, and the bad feelings exploded. On the afternoon of the 20th of this month, the Cantonese workers spontaneously went on strike. Tracing the source of the disaster, it was caused by the abuse of workers by two or three Cantonese employers. Our union traces the source, and all wages and losses during this strike period are borne by the two or three employers, and we will seek compensation from them according to law. This concerns the livelihood of workers, and the future is precarious. We are forced to rise up and fight against employers with a penchant for abuse, and we are determined to fight with them to the end until the goal of amending the contract, increasing wages, and liberating workers from suffering is achieved. We are deeply afraid that the storm will expand and implicate the innocent. In order to maintain justice, we hereby warn a small number of employers not to obstruct the labor movement again and incite tragedy. We hereby announce the process to the public to clarify the truth. We hope that all sectors will uphold justice and provide assistance. This is our declaration. We hope you will understand the reasons.</p>
<h3>Cold Work Workers to Receive Additional Rice Allowance</h3>
<p>To Be Implemented from July</p>
<p>In recent days, the price of rice has been rising sharply, and the cold-work workers in the iron industry, who make small parts and flower knives, have been unable to make ends meet. Representatives were elected to request the store owners to increase wages from July. As the deadline is approaching, the store owners specially invited the workers' representatives and workers to discuss the matter yesterday. The representatives stated the workers' difficulties and asked the store owners to sympathize with the workers' hardships and generously grant a wage increase to alleviate their difficulties. The store owners discussed that the workers' demands were realistic, but the cost of goods purchased by the store was high, and the selling price could not be increased. The workers should also be aware of this. When the new goods are on the market and business improves, they will definitely consider an increase. The workers' representatives then said that the current request for a wage increase is really due to the suffering of expensive rice and firewood. We workers provide our own meals and have no choice but to ask the store owners to increase wages. After the store owners and representatives discussed for a long time, the store slightly increased the wages as a rice allowance, and the workers could not have any other opinions. It will be implemented from July.</p>
<p>North City</p>
<h3>Dispute Over the City Branch Bank Renting a House</h3>
<p>The City North Tax Collection Office Replies to the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The City North Tax Collection Office replies to the letter from the Merchant Group Reorganization Committee: "Regarding the letter from the Lǚyè Trade Association stating that its members, Shí Ruìjì and Xīn Xiéshùn, received a letter from your office transferred by the landlord of the Wénxiào Fāng on Baoshan Road, ordering them to move out of the house, and expressing deep gratitude for your committee's repeated guidance, we have investigated this case. Because the four city houses in that location are suitable for the City Bank to use as a branch, the director ordered a letter to be sent to the Wénxiào Company landlord's accounting office, advising each tenant to move out, and offering a relocation fee of 290 yuan per house. Unexpectedly, these merchants not only did not move out for many days but also presented a complaint to the Municipal Government and the Lǚyè Trade Association, requesting assistance, claiming that they were being forced to rent. This is a great misunderstanding. Our office has only been in contact with the Wénxiào Company from beginning to end. The company is willing to sign a ten-year contract and has not made any remarks against it. We have not directly negotiated with the merchants, nor have we sent the police to force them to move. How can it be said that they are being forced to rent? The association did not investigate the facts and hastily published them in the newspaper, seeking assistance from all sectors, which is somewhat provocative. Furthermore, these shops have very little capital. For example, the brown couch shop is worth less than 100 yuan, and the shoe and cake shops are also worth less than 200 or 300 yuan. Now, a relocation fee of 290 yuan is not small. How can they say that they are about to go bankrupt? It is alarming. The establishment of the City Bank is a financial circulation institution for the citizens, which is different from other operators. The location of the branch is very important. After several careful selections, this house is the most suitable. Why should we give it up and look for another one? If everyone follows suit and obstructs each other, there will be no place to establish a branch. In short, the establishment of the City Bank by the Municipal Government to circulate finance and seek benefits for the citizens should be assisted by all citizens. If the business situation is difficult, we can give some leeway to the relocation fee to show our concern. Please advise them to move out as soon as possible. Yours sincerely, the Shanghai Special Municipality Merchant Group Reorganization Committee."</p>
<h3>Celebrities Support National Products Department Store</h3>
<p>Since the news of the preparation for the establishment of the China National Products Department Store was released, participants from far and near have come in droves. Celebrities from the Party and the country, such as Hu Hanmin, Wang Zhengting, Wang Boqun, Niu Yongjian, Kong Xiangxi, Zhang Wohua, Ma Yinchu, as well as the leaders of the Party, government, and military in this city, such as Pan Gongzhan, Xiong Shihui, and Wang Yansong, have sent inscriptions to encourage them. The Chinese members of the Public Works Department Board of Directors, such as Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng, have also expressed their support. Therefore, the progress is very smooth. It is reported that in order to arouse the interest of guests, the department store has specially opened an entertainment section to help with the festivities. It has hired Mr. Zeng Baoquan to preside over the matter and is currently searching for elegant entertainment in order to give the people of Shanghai a new experience.</p>
<h3>County Construction Bureau Bureau Affairs Meeting</h3>

The chairman first reported: (1) Technician Wang of this bureau resigned due to personal reasons, and Gong Linhang was recommended and submitted to the department for approval.

The second district office has been notified to investigate. The following resolutions were made on various cases: (1) The Construction Department sent a telegram urging the completion and submission of the current civil servant appraisal review form and the family status survey form. It was resolved to collect all of them within this week in order to forward them. (2) Approved the letter from Director Peng of the second district requesting that personnel be sent to measure the streets of Tangwan.

<p>Jìshēng Society</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Handling Disaster Relief in Shaanxi</h3>
<p>The China Jìshēng Society recently received a report from Zhang Xianqing, director of the disaster relief office in Shaanxi, stating that the disaster relief work in Shaanxi is extremely difficult due to the combination of soldiers and bandits. For example, in Wugong County, it is divided into five districts. Every time a district is investigated, it is necessary to clear the local natives in advance before investigation can be carried out. Otherwise, there is no one to guide the local area, and they do not know the roads and sigh in despair. Moreover, transporting disaster relief funds is too dangerous. On the morning of the 29th of last month, he personally escorted the second disaster relief fund of 42,000 yuan. The car traveled 60 miles, and there were ambushes along the way. Coupled with heavy rain, the car was difficult to travel. He had to walk 40 miles to Xingping County. The county only had 30 Baojia teams to guard the city, and they were frightened. He met with local officials and gentry, and he was taken to see the upright people in the county and the disaster relief shelters and disaster relief shelters they were running. After careful investigation, the handling was still good. Among them, Zheng Shen Zhang Yusheng repeatedly requested to take in more than 300 disaster-stricken children. It was originally scheduled to be dismissed at the end of May. However, it was found that only dozens of the disaster-stricken children could return home to live, and the rest had nowhere to go. Even if they return, there is no way to survive. There are no local funds to support them. Xianqing could not bear to see them die without help. He set up a disaster-stricken children's education and training center in Xingping, with a quota of more than 100 children. The cost of each child is about 3 yuan per month, limited to three months, and will be disbanded at the time of the autumn harvest. Zhang Jun Yusheng was appointed as the director to handle it in accordance with the Society's program for disaster-stricken children's shelters. On the 30th, it was raining and difficult to travel. The county magistrate of Xingping told the county magistrate of Wugong that he had been taken away by bandits early on. Wugong was terrified. Fortunately, they did not move forward. Xianqing immediately sent a special messenger with a letter to inquire about the disaster relief friend Lu Shuchen, stationed in Wugong, whether disaster relief could be carried out. The reply stated that the disaster relief notice had been issued, and tens of thousands of disaster victims were holding tickets waiting to receive it. Xianqing had to risk carrying the money to Dazhuang Town, 15 miles from the city, for distribution on the 31st. After the distribution, he returned to the city. On June 2nd, he went to Zhenyuan Town, 15 miles from the city, to distribute 20,000 yuan. The above two districts have distributed a total of 40,000 yuan for urgent relief and seed money, and the entire county can be considered completed. However, the disaster situation in the county last autumn was the most severe. Poor disaster victims fled famine on a large scale, abandoning all boys and girls. The Society originally ran two disaster-stricken children's shelters in the county. Other charity groups also had disaster-stricken children's shelters. However, the Society used the method of combining education and training, while other shelters only provided shelter. Therefore, the Society's shelter has a unique reputation. At the moment, other charity shelters have been suspended due to lack of funds. The county's wheat harvest is less than 20%. The disaster-stricken children are unable to return home. The Society has to add a third disaster-stricken children's shelter. The Society plans to set up three disaster-stricken children's shelters in Wugong County, each educating and training more than 500 children, until mid-August, with a monthly fee of about 3 yuan per child. After the decision was made, they went to Fufeng County in the western part of the county to deal with the disaster. However, the county magistrate of Fufeng County fled for more than ten days, and the gentry fled far away. No one in the county presided over the responsibility. In this case, the Society decided not to go to investigate and release the emergency relief funds. Only when all the disaster relief committee members temporarily return to the provincial capital of Xi'an, rest for a few days, and select the disaster-stricken counties that can proceed, can they deal with it at their discretion. There are still various difficulties that cannot be conveyed in writing. It is really helpless. Only take one step at a time and save one person at a time. The above details are all reported by Zhang Jun in Shaanxi about the situation in Wugong and Fufeng counties. The situation in other counties can be known. The disaster relief and rescue of people are so difficult. When will the vast disaster be reduced? Looking westward, the wailing crows are calling to the sky without response, only sighing in vain.</p>

<h3>Scorching Heat in the City Yesterday</h3>
<p>Maximum Temperature Reached 93.3 Degrees</p>
<p>The city has been experiencing continuous moldy rain, and the moisture in the air causes objects to become damp. However, most citizens do not feel uncomfortable. Last Sunday, the sky suddenly cleared up. Yesterday morning, the moisture on the ground evaporated due to the sunlight, making people feel extremely depressed. By noon, dark clouds rolled in, and the scorching sun appeared and disappeared from time to time, making people feel even more stuffy and uncomfortable. Office workers indoors and pedestrians on the road were all drenched in sweat. Even those taking a stroll in the gardens felt the heat without any breeze. By late at night, the heat still did not subside. This is what a scorching summer is like. Electric fans in various organizations ran non-stop, and cars with fans showed off on the roads. The various parks certainly made three times their usual profits, and those sitting or lying down to cool off along the roads were also everywhere. According to the report from the Xujiahui Observatory, yesterday's maximum temperature was 93.3 degrees, and the minimum temperature was also above 70 degrees.</p>

<h3>Arrest of a Foreign Female Thief</h3>
<p>Suspected of Being a Member of an International Pickpocketing Gang</p>
<p>The Dalu Bao reports that a special Western detective from the French Concession Police Department, after three weeks of investigation, arrested a female thief named Tera Shu Dengbao on Sunday. She arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin three months ago. Since her arrival, strange theft cases have frequently occurred in the French Concession, and the stolen items are mostly valuable items such as jewelry. Under strict interrogation, the woman has confessed to three major cases, saying that she often rents rooms in areas where the wealthy live, and after a long period of observation, she takes action when the opportunity arises. When her whereabouts are gradually exposed, she moves elsewhere on the pretext to avoid suspicion. Therefore, she has been committing thefts for a long time, and few people know about it. It is now expected that this person may be a member of an international pickpocketing gang, who often commits thefts in various ports in the Far East. It is also heard that after a thorough investigation of the major theft case on Huanlong Road on June 3, a woman surnamed Zha Dengke was arrested and confessed to three thefts. The nature of the cases is also quite similar.</p>
<h3>Tram Collision in the French Concession</h3>
<p>Fortunately, No Major Disaster Occurred in Broad Daylight</p>
<p>Male and Female Passengers Slightly Injured</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:35 p.m., French Concession Tram No. 112 on Route 2, traveling from east to west, stopped at Ferguson Road because the tram traveling east had not passed (the location is a single track). Then they were about to drive back-to-back when Tram No. 323, whose ticket seller forgot to turn on the headlights, suddenly rang the bell and started to turn south. Unexpectedly, when it reached the intersection of Yaozhu Road and Jiaotong University Alley, Tram No. 118 on Route 2 was traveling from south to north. Fortunately, driver No. 59 saw it and immediately applied the brakes, avoiding a major disaster. At the same time, Tram No. 111 on Route 2 was speeding from behind. Driver No. 128 saw that there were two cars stopped in front and knew that something was wrong, but the car was traveling too fast to apply the brakes, causing it to collide with Tram No. 112 on Route 2. With a loud bang, the entire car shook, and everyone except the passengers fell to the ground, injuring Jiang Shixu, Zhang Zhenqi, Hu Yaodong, and Mrs. Jiang Hu in their arms and waists. Fortunately, they were not seriously injured, but they were quite frightened.</p>
<h3>Confiscation of Forged Official Seals of the Bandit Suppression Department</h3>
<p>Gu Lanfang Shifts Blame to Her Son</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., the Garrison Headquarters Investigation Team sent two special investigators with a document to the Second District, First Precinct of the Public Security Bureau, stating that according to confidential reports, there was a Gu surnamed person forging official documents at No. 9 Minzhu Street in their jurisdiction. They requested that the police be dispatched quickly to assist in the arrest. Upon hearing the report, Section Chief Qian immediately ordered a patrol officer to lead a number of policemen to go together. When they arrived, they found that it was the Shuimu Workshop opened by Gu Fanglan from Ningbo. They immediately entered the house to search and seized on the spot a forged official seal of the Jiang, Zhejiang, and Anhui Bandit Suppression Command Investigation Department, six staff badges, one order, and three official documents, all of which were forged. Gu Fanglan was immediately detained. After a brief interrogation by Section Chief Qian, she confessed that she was 47 years old and from Ningbo. All the forged official documents and official seals were made by her son, Gu Wenbing. Wenbing is currently out, and she was not aware of the matter. After the interrogation, Section Chief Qian handed her over to the investigators to be brought back for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Record of the Trial of the Wage Robbery Murder Case</h3>
<p>Chinese and Western Employees of the Huangpu Bureau Died Tragically</p>
<p>Zhang Genbao Admits to Committing the Crime of Murder</p>
<p>On the morning of the 30th of last month, the Huangpu Bureau entrusted a large sum of money to the bureau's British engineer, Hart Owen, and Chinese employee Shen Duoting, to take a small steamer to Yangshupu to distribute wages to the river workers. The steamer was robbed en route. The Laozha Police Station subsequently arrested several suspects, who were detained for interrogation. The robbers had planned the robbery in advance. Ten people, including the ringleaders Zhang Along, Changmao Jinsheng, Li Xisheng, Agen, Liu Jinxiao, Zhang Sheng, Xiao Tang, Zhang Genbao, and Feng Qing, came up with the idea. Along opened a room in the Oriental Hotel and gathered his accomplices to discuss the robbery method. It was decided that Zhang Genbao and Xiao Tang would rent a small steamer from the Huangpu Ferry Bureau, and the rest of the group would wait at the Taihe Wharf in Pudong. On the morning of the 30th of last month, these people knew that the Huangpu Bureau was distributing wages that morning, so they proceeded according to the planned plan. Zhang and Tang rented a small steamer No. 15 and ordered the helmsman to sail to Taihe Wharf. Zhang Along and others then led the group to board the boat. At this time, Changmao Jinxing and Agen had secretly transported the guns. The method of transporting the guns was to hide the pistols in a bucket, covered with old cloth. Then, the robbers distributed the pistols. Zhang Along, Changmao Jinsheng, Li Xisheng, Agen, Xiao Zhangsheng, and Zhang Genbao each received one gun. Then, they ordered the helmsman to cast off and sail to the Ruirong Iron Factory Wharf in Yangshupu. At that time, the Lihai steamer of the Huangpu Bureau had not yet arrived. The robbers had to moor the boat and wait. After a while, the Lihai ship arrived. The Chinese and British engineers on the ship asked a river worker to board the ship to collect his salary. When they were distributing to the sixth person, the robbers on the No. 15 boat suddenly pulled out their pistols and forced the boat owner, Shen Alin, to move the boat closer to Lihai. Along, Jinsheng, Agen, and others fired a volley of shots at Lihai. The bullets fell everywhere, and everyone in the Lihai cabin, including Hart, was injured. However, Zhang Genbao's gun was rusty and useless, so Zhang threw the gun into the river at that time. After the robbers knocked everyone on the Lihai ship down, they jumped onto the boat. Except for Hart and Shen Duoting, who were already dead, Owen and Jin Asi were only injured, so they were driven to the back cabin and guarded by two robbers. The Lihai stoker and another robber sailed Lihai to the No. 15 small steamer rented by the robbers. At this time, two robbers ordered the helmsman to sail. When they arrived at Datong Wharf, the robbers took the money and fled ashore. The amount was about 21,000 yuan. The Lihai stoker saw that the robbers had left, so he drove the boat back to the Jianghai Customs. According to reports, after the incident, the robbers divided the looted money into ten shares, and the remainder was given to Zhang Genbao, who gave Zhang Along 800 yuan to buy a ticket to Singapore. Along escaped after getting the money. Feng Qing's share of 600 yuan was embezzled by Agen during the transfer. Zhang Genbao spent the huge amount of money he received on prostitutes and drugs, and frequented gambling dens. On the evening of the 14th of this month, detective Liu Junqing learned that Genbao would go to the gambling den every day at this time, so he waited there. He saw Genbao entering and did not disturb him. When Genbao came out, he followed him to the intersection of Aidaoya Road and Hubei Road and arrested him. As the main culprit, he did not try to deny the plan for the robbery, and confessed everything, and said that the money he had received had already been spent, mostly in the gambling den. Detective Liu then conducted a thorough investigation based on his confession. At first, only Yao Zucheng, a native of Pudong, was arrested at No. 2064 Xinzha Road. On the 19th, Feng Qing was arrested in Shiwujian in Pudong. In addition, four other people were arrested and sent to the Shanghai District Court for investigation and prosecution. The day before yesterday, the police sent detectives to No. 17 Sapo Sai Road and No. 750 Weihaiwei Road in the French Concession to search for Zhang Along, but he was not found. Yesterday morning, Zhang Genbao, Yao Zucheng, and Feng Qing were sent to the Special District Court, where Judge Xu Jiashi continued the trial. Zhang spoke eloquently and without fear, saying that Yao had nothing to do with it and that he was framing him because he had a grudge against him. Yao claimed that he was being framed. Feng claimed that he was deceived by others. The court ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody for another two weeks for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Announcement of Verdict in Pudong Robbery Case</h3>
<p>Criminal Sentences for Criminals</p>
<p>Civil Ruling for Compensation</p>
<p>The Xinshunchang, Yishunfeng, Yongfengli, and other three customs declaration agencies in the city ordered Wu Haisheng, the ship operator (i.e., the dock shipowner), to supervise the old foreman Fan Miaohai and several crew members to rock the ship to the Taikoo Wharf, Huashun Wharf, and Dumb Wharf on April 8 of this year to load Ning silk, green tribute cloth, black tribute cloth, Baushi cloth, Western silk, Crossa, satin cloth, and other foreign clothing materials, totaling 250 pieces, worth 6,000 yuan. At about 9:00 p.m. that night, they rocked out from the Hongkou area and planned to unload the goods at the Longmao Warehouse in Pudong. Unexpectedly, when they passed the Pudong surface near the Suzhou River estuary, two double-oared boats blocked the cargo ship head-on. Eight or nine robbers with pistols jumped onto the cargo ship, tied up the old foreman and crew members, and imprisoned them in the cabin. They completely loaded the goods onto the boats and escaped. The robbed cargo ship was abandoned by the robbers in the Suzhou River near the Jiangyuan Alley in Henan, and the old foreman and crew members were imprisoned in the cabin and could not escape. Until 4:00 a.m. the next morning, the three agencies sent people to search for the missing ship and goods and found the original ship there. They untied the old foreman and crew members, checked the goods, and found that they had all been robbed. They reported the losses to the agencies and asked the Lujiazui Water Patrol Station to order the arrest of the robbers. Subsequently, the water patrol station's Chinese detectives Cheng Yongnian, Sun Agui, Wang Haiquan, and Huang Zhenlin arrested the main culprits Ji Chunbao and Wan Jinbao, who confessed to their accomplices, including Xiao Changsan, Changfa, Shandong Lao San, Lao Wu (i.e., Wushizi), and an unknown Jiangbei person and three Shandong people. The detectives from the patrol station, together with the detectives from the Public Concession Patrol Station, arrested the main culprit Yuan Shaoqing (i.e., Shandong Lao San) and Cao Hanqing and Wan Zhongliang, who sold the stolen goods, and Xu Bingquan and Xu Jisheng, who bought the stolen goods, and Gu Peiqing, who helped transport the stolen goods, totaling eight people. They seized 27 bullets from Yuan Shaoqing and recovered about 4,000 yuan worth of stolen goods. The prisoners were all temporarily detained in the West Prison and sent to the Special District Court, which opened a hearing and determined that the verdict would be announced on the afternoon of the 24th of this month. Yesterday, the water patrol station's captain Ka Li Jiao and the original detectives from the water and land patrol stations escorted all the prisoners to the court. Judge Wu Tingqi sat in the Third Criminal Court and wrote the verdict, saying that Ji Chunbao and Wan Jinbao were each guilty of carrying weapons and gang robbery, and were each sentenced to ten years in prison and deprivation of public rights for life. Yuan Shaoqing was guilty of carrying weapons and gang robbery and was sentenced to ten years in prison and deprivation of public rights for life. He was also guilty of possessing military bullets with the intention of committing a crime and was sentenced to two years in prison. The sentences were to be served concurrently for a total of ten years and six months. Cao Hanqing and Wan Zhongliang were each guilty of selling stolen goods and were each sentenced to four months in prison and fined 1,000 yuan each. Xu Bingquan and Xu Jisheng were each guilty of buying stolen goods and were each fined 1,000 yuan. If they failed to pay, they would be imprisoned for one year. Gu Peiqing was fined 200 yuan. The above eight criminals should jointly compensate Xinshunchang, Yishunfeng, and Yongfengli for damages of 1,296 taels, six mace, and three fen of silver. After the verdict was announced, they were ordered to be remanded in custody to await execution.</p>
<p>Actively Underway</p>
<h3>Weile Garden Cycling Race</h3>
<p>Weile Garden on Haig Road has been under construction for more than a month. Engineer Ta Foers is urging the construction to proceed without sparing any effort. The track has already been completed first, and the grandstand has also begun construction. It is expected that it can be completed in mid-July, and the official opening can be held at the end of July. The new Western cycling tricks that Shanghai has never seen before will open our eyes at that time. The track is 250 meters long, and the turning point is at a 43-degree angle, solid and exquisite, not inferior to the Weile Garden in Paris. The Matter Indelible car race is held here, which can reach a speed of 60 to 70 kilometers per hour. There is a dance floor in the field, which is the largest in area and is unparalleled at the time. Electric torches are installed around it, and it is as bright as day, and the outdoor air is fresh and cool. It is the only summer resort and entertainment place on the sea. Once it opens, you can watch the car race and find a partner to dance. The leisure and elegance are fascinating. Under the strict training of Swedish expert Peng Sheng, the Chinese, Japanese, and Angolan jockeys in the garden have made great progress and are quite impressive. As the opening date is approaching, they are working harder and harder. Manager Pang Meng and Chinese Manager Chen Shouzhi are urging the plan and putting in a lot of effort to make all the facilities perfect and become the center of entertainment for the public to enjoy. President Boris recently returned from an inspection of the Weile Garden in Paris and hired the world-renowned cycling expert Ta Laiyi from France to come to Shanghai to provide assistance. Therefore, the club's affairs are on the rise.</p>

<p>The First Phase Goes Straight to the Malay Peninsula</p>
<p>The China Youth Asia Walking Group, which was established in the last ten days, was officially filed with the Municipal Government of this city on the 20th of this month.

<p>City Ferry</p>
<h3>Passengers Receive Free Cholera Vaccination</h3>
<p>The Municipal Office of the Pujiang Ferry operates 24 shifts a day between the Nanjing Road Bund and Donggou in Pudong. Each shift carries no less than four or five hundred passengers. The Municipal Health Bureau, in order to facilitate citizens to get cholera vaccinations, has decided to dispatch nurses starting from July 10, carrying cholera vaccination equipment and materials, to set up vaccination stations on the ferries to provide preventive vaccinations for passengers getting on and off the ferry. It has sent a letter to the Municipal Public Works Bureau to allocate ferry positions and provide assistance. It is learned that the bureau believes that the matter is related to public health and should be handled in coordination. It has ordered the ferry staff to announce the vaccination method to passengers, persuade them to get vaccinated, and designate the office on the top of the ship to carry out the vaccination work.</p>
<h3>Wusong to Have Daytime Electricity</h3>
<p>The electricity for the entire Wusong area has always been supplied by Baoming Electric Company, which sells it for 25 cents per degree. After Wusong was placed under the jurisdiction of Shanghai Special City, the company reduced the price by 2 cents per degree to 23 cents per degree to give preferential treatment to users. At the request of the users, it was reduced by another 2 cents, and the current price is 21 cents per degree. However, the company's generator is small, so Wusong does not have daytime electricity facilities, which is inconvenient for users. Although the company has plans for development, it has not been realized due to various difficulties. The Municipal Public Works Bureau believes that the electricity in the city's scope should also be unified, and the lack of daytime electricity in Wusong cannot be allowed. It ordered the company to realize it as soon as possible to meet public needs. It is learned that Baoming Company has contacted the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant, and all the electricity for the entire Wusong area will be supplied by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant. Baoming Company does not need to generate electricity by itself, and both parties will benefit from it. Therefore, the result is very satisfactory. Once the new Zhabei Power Plant is completed, a contract can be signed and power can be supplied.</p>

<p>Trial Yesterday</p>
<h3>The Liu Siqiao Death by Crushing Compensation Case</h3>
<p>Plaintiff Demands 60,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Defendant Says He Will Do His Utmost</p>
<p>A Cantonese man, Pan Shiju, while driving his newly purchased automobile in the western part of Shanghai, knocked down and crushed to death the traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Liu Siqiao, who was riding in a rickshaw. Afterwards, Liu Siqiao's wife, Liu Li, accused Pan of homicide in the Special District Court. A court hearing was held, but due to mediation by friends and relatives of both parties, the plaintiff withdrew the lawsuit, as reported in previous newspapers. However, while Liu Li withdrew the criminal suit, she is still pursuing civil litigation for damages, demanding compensation of 60,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Wenrong of the Special District Court held a hearing. First, the plaintiff's lawyer presented the case. Then, the defendant stated that his car collided with Liu's rickshaw, and if Liu had not gotten out of the rickshaw, the accident might not have happened. Judge Xu then inquired about the defendant's family situation and suggested a settlement. Pan replied that he has parents, his father works at the Public Works Department, and he has five brothers, but he does not know the extent of the family property. If the plaintiff is willing to settle, he will do his utmost, but the amount demanded by the plaintiff is too high, and he cannot afford it. The plaintiff's lawyer, upon hearing Pan's statement, immediately stated that the defendant has never negotiated a settlement with the plaintiff, and from the defendant's defense, it is clear that he is trying to shirk responsibility. The facts stated by the plaintiff are exactly the same as those in the criminal complaint. At the time, the defendant did not deny negligence, but now he denies responsibility for negligence. Other defenses, such as the car only traveling at 17 or 18 li per hour and that the deceased got out of the rickshaw from the south side, are all empty words and inconsistent with the facts. He requested that the criminal case files be reviewed to clarify the matter. Judge Xu then adjourned the hearing to June 30th in the morning to investigate the evidence for further questioning.</p>
<h3>The Ma Weiwen Death by Crushing Compensation Case</h3>
<p>Automobile Driver Xu Jingui Brought from Prison for Questioning</p>
<p>Ma Xiaoyun, a native of Taizhou residing at the Dakang Yarn Factory's workers' quarters on Haizhou Road, had a son named Weiwen, only twelve years old. On April 19th, Weiwen was struck and killed on Taopeng Road by a freight truck driven by Xu Jingui, a driver employed by the Shen Renlin Automobile Company at 86 Macleod Road. The police reported the incident to the authorities and confirmed the death, ordering that the body be placed in a coffin. The automobile driver, Xu Jingui, was detained and brought before the Special District Court, which sentenced Xu to a fine of 330 yuan. However, Xu did not have this large sum to pay, so he was imprisoned instead. Now, the Ma couple believe that their son's tragic death has caused not only funeral expenses but also other significant damages, such as the cost of raising him to the age of twelve, the betrothal gift for his future wife, and the future support of his parents by the child. Previously, these were merely possibilities or without hope of realization. Such losses should be jointly borne by the owner of the automobile company and the driver who caused the accident. Therefore, they have hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Shen and Xu for damages, requesting a judgment ordering them to compensate 150 yuan for funeral expenses, 1,000 yuan for the cost of raising the child, 250 yuan for the betrothal gift, and 500 yuan for the parents' retirement support, totaling 1,900 yuan, and ordering them to bear the costs of the lawsuit. Yesterday, Judge Zhou Daren held a hearing. The prison was notified in advance to send Xu Jingui to the court under guard. The defendant also hired lawyer Shen Yuesheng to defend him. Regarding the plaintiff's claim that their son was betrothed, fearing that it was not true, the judge was requested to order the witnesses to withdraw and be questioned separately for a long time. After the lawyers of both sides concluded their arguments, Judge Zhou ordered that the judgment be announced on a scheduled date, and Xu Jingui was escorted back to the Tilanqiao Prison for confinement.</p>

<p>Xu Funian, a 33-year-old man from Yangzhou who collected tickets at the Jai Alai stadium on Avenue Albert in the French Concession, had recently been having an affair with Wu, also known as Wu Laoda, the wife of Han Fuguo, a native of Danyang residing at 40 Sheng Sheng Li, Qianjiatang. The illicit affair had occurred more than once. The night before, while Wu's husband, Han Fuguo, was out, Xu went to Wu's place for another secret rendezvous. Han found out about it and was furious. At 6:30 AM yesterday, he gathered seven or eight friends and went to Wu's house to catch the adulterer. At the time, Wu and Xu were sleeping in bed, enjoying their sweet dreams. Han and his friends broke down the door and entered, startling them awake. Han and his friends dragged Xu from the bed and beat him. In a moment of desperation, Xu, with no way to escape, broke free and jumped out of the window in an attempt to flee. Unfortunately, he fell to the ground and was severely injured. The Baojian Road police station was notified and immediately dispatched an officer to the scene. Han and his wife were arrested and taken to the police station. The injured Xu Funian was taken by car to Guangci Hospital. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died soon after, despite medical treatment. The hospital notified the police station, who transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall autopsy room. Xu's younger brother, Xu Kuiliu (a barber at a French law school on Avenue Albert), was notified and brought to the scene. Zhu, the judge of the French court, arrived at the hall at 2 PM to examine the body. After taking his seat, the detective reported the previous events and brought Han and Wu to the court to await questioning. Xu Kuiliu requested justice. After Judge Zhu questioned Wu, he declared that Xu Funian's death was due to injuries sustained from the fall. He ordered the family to collect the body and await the police station's investigation and trial of the defendants.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping for Money</h3>
<p>Both Are Illegal</p>
<p>Wang Dayuan, a brothel madam in the French Concession, reported to the French police a few days ago that Zhang Xibao, Wei Bingchang, and others brought a woman named Wu Xiaomei, falsely claiming that she was Zhang's wife and that they were forced by poverty to offer her to the madam as a prostitute for 200 yuan. At the time, the madam believed them and paid the amount, with a contract as proof. Unexpectedly, Wu Xiaomei escaped without a trace the next day. This situation clearly indicated a "pigeon drop" scam, and she requested an investigation. The police chief immediately ordered officers to arrest Wei and Wu, while the others fled. Yesterday, they were brought to the French court for investigation. The plaintiff recounted the events and requested the return of the money. Wu Xiaomei, 21 years old, stated that she made a living knitting socks and was deceived by other girls into being offered as a prostitute at the plaintiff's establishment. She also claimed to be a victim and asked for leniency. Wei Bingchang stated that he was asked by Zhang Xibao, who was still at large, to act as a middleman and received 25 yuan for his services, and he knew nothing else. Judge Zhu sentenced Wei to two months imprisonment, with the option of paying a fine to commute the sentence. Wu Xiaomei, deemed ignorant, was released with a reprimand.</p>
<h3>The Lawsuit for Cohabitation Between Wei and Zhang</h3>
<p>Previously Convicted of Bigamy</p>
<p>Now Investigating the Following</p>
<p>Wei Zhang (also known as Zhang Manzhen), a 23-year-old woman from Baoshan, married Wei Peng, also from the same hometown, at the age of sixteen through a matchmaker named Qiao Pinmei. They have a daughter, seven years old, and a son, four years old. Wei lost his parents at a young age and was raised by his aunt, Chen Wei, at whose house they married and lived together. Although they were aunt and nephew, their affection was akin to that of mother and son, and they treated Zhang as their daughter-in-law. At the beginning of their marriage, the couple's relationship was good. However, last year, for some unknown reason, the couple fell out of love, and Wei Peng married Wang Jinfeng outside. Zhang discovered this and filed a criminal complaint for bigamy with the District Court. Wei Peng and Wang Jinfeng were summoned to court, and after investigation, they were prosecuted. The Criminal Court found both Wei and Wang guilty of bigamy and sentenced them to one month of imprisonment. They were released from prison in December of last year. After Zhang filed the lawsuit, she resided at her mother's house (in Hong'anfang, North Zhejiang Road). Upon hearing that her husband had been released from prison, Zhang went to Chen Wei's house, hoping to reunite with her husband. However, the attempt was unsuccessful and resulted in conflict. Now, Wei Zhang, feeling that living at her mother's house was not a long-term solution, hired lawyer Liu Xiang and filed a petition with the District Court, requesting cohabitation. Her petition stated that the defendant, Wei Peng, committed bigamy and still abandoned her, requesting a judgment ordering cohabitation. Previously, the defendant, under the instigation of his aunt, Chen Wei, committed bigamy with Wang Jinfeng. The court's Criminal Court rendered a judgment on November 30th of the 18th year (of the Republic), (the main text) Wei Peng is found guilty of bigamy and sentenced to one month of imprisonment; Wang Jinfeng, knowing of his marriage, is found guilty of marrying him and sentenced to one month of imprisonment. After the defendant was released, he remained unrepentant. The plaintiff went to his house at Fenshui Temple several times, but Chen Wei instructed the defendant to avoid meeting her. The plaintiff, a vulnerable woman, could not resist and appealed to the local Public Security Bureau, requesting to file a lawsuit with the court. The plaintiff, a lonely woman, has no means of making a living and has no choice but to live at her mother's house, but her father is already sixty years old, and her mother is often ill. The family has no permanent assets and is in ordinary circumstances. The plaintiff married unhappily and cannot afford to add to the burden of her elderly parents. Since then, more than a year has passed. In reality, the defendant's abandonment was instigated by his aunt, Chen Wei. The instigator is undeniably guilty. But the plaintiff is still young and has children, and she is living at her mother's house. She will need to rely on something for food and clothing for years to come. It seems that abandoning the old and loving the new, their affection has run dry, in the defendant's youth and inexperience, Chen Wei ranks among the elders, coming forward strongly, life is unfortunate, it is painful to speak of, thinking over and over, there is only recounting the under the table situation, requesting that Chen Wei be ordered to appear in court, ordering to hand over the defendant Wei Peng that is Wei Yun Sheng to appear in court, to inquire of the entire origin, to reconcile and cohabitate and so on. On the 19th of this month, Judge Zhao Zhenhai held a hearing. Neither the defendant Wei Peng nor Chen Wei appeared, only the plaintiff Wei Zhang and Zhang's father, Zhang Ziheng, appeared in court to recount the events. The judge asked that Wei Peng committed bigamy with Wang Jinfeng, this is his fault, but you sued him, tried him and ate his officialdom, the feelings were bankrupted, the defendant did not arrive, and the court will hear back. Yesterday, another summons was received, but the defendant still did not arrive, while Chen Wei hired lawyer Xi Yuchang to represent her in court. At 10 AM, Judge Zhao took his seat in the second courtroom. The plaintiff Wei Zhang and lawyer Liu arrived in court as summoned. First, lawyer Xi rose and stated that because Wei Zhang often quarreled at home, Chen Wei ordered Wei Peng and Zhang to move out and live separately. This lawsuit between Wei Zhang and Wei Peng has nothing to do with Chen Wei, and Wei Peng does not live in Chen's house. The plaintiff Wei Zhang stated that Wei Peng does live in Chen's house and requested that Chen Wei be ordered to appear in court and hand over Wei Peng. The witness Qiao Pinmei, 58 years old, a local, stated that he runs a tobacco and paper shop on Avenue Edward VII. (The judge asked) Do you have any connections with the Wei family? (The witness answered) I call Chen Wei my aunt. Wei Peng's father, Wei Baochang, died five or six years ago. In the past, he lived with Chen Heting (Chen Wei's husband). (The judge asked) Why does Wei Peng not want Zhang? (The witness answered) I do not know. According to my reasoning, Wei Peng is young and ignorant, and this unfortunate thing happened. Last year, around September or October, I tried to mediate, but it was unsuccessful. (The judge asked) Where did Wei Peng go? (The witness answered) I do not know. The judge then asked the plaintiff if Wei Peng still lives in Chen's house. The plaintiff answered that he does live in Chen's house. At this point, lawyer Xi rose and stated that because Wei Peng and Zhang quarreled from time to time, Chen Wei issued an eviction order, ordering Wei Peng to move out. The judge said to the plaintiff, Husband and wife should live together. Now you go investigate where Wei Peng is. When you find him, you might as well hold onto him. Wherever he goes, you follow him. If he eats, you eat. If he hits you, then you come and sue him. The case is now considered concluded, and the judgment will be made on the 28th. The court is adjourned. When Wei Zhang testified in court, she was holding a child (her four-year-old son), tears streaming down her face, in a state of great distress, which was heartbreaking to see.</p>
<p>Municipal Government</p>
<h3>Criticism of Those Opposing the Imperial Grant of the Yangdian Temple</h3>
<p>A citizen, Shen Jinkui, previously submitted a complaint alleging that the Pudong Imperial Grant Yangdian Temple Management Committee was illegal, which the Municipal Government has rejected. The official response stated: "The petition is noted. After reviewing the inscription on the Yangdian Temple, it is clear that the temple was rebuilt with funds donated by local people, and there is no clear evidence of a rotation system by the four branches of the Shen family. The claim by these citizens that it is a family temple is incorrect. Since the temple is public property, it is appropriate to temporarily organize a committee for its management and maintenance before the establishment of an autonomous organization. Furthermore, the committee members are mostly municipal committee members and village elders, publicly elected by the local community. There is no collusion to speak of. Shen Jinkui and others are hereby ordered to hand over the farmland deeds and refrain from interference." This is the official response.</p>
<h3>Theft and Swearing an Oath Leading to Death</h3>
<p>Going to the City God Temple to Swear an Oath</p>
<p>Li Fugeng, a native of Nantong residing at 59 Anleli, Hujunying, Nanshi, 37 years old, suspected that Li Chunhua, who lived with him, had stolen a gold ring from his home on the 12th of this month. He reported the theft to the police, who detained Li Chunhua and brought him before the District Court. However, there was no evidence, and he was released. But Li Chunhua felt wronged and forced Li Fugeng to swear an oath at the City God Temple. The oath stated, "If someone stole something, that person will die; conversely, if someone is wrongly accused, then I myself should die." At that time, Li Fugeng was already ill. After swearing the oath, Li Chunhua also wanted to have "jiangcha" with him and file a false accusation. Li Fugeng's illness worsened, and he died the night before. The neighbors deliberately embellished the story, claiming that the City God had taken him, promoting superstition with all their might, which is absurd. However, Li's wife, Li Qiu, was able to dispel the superstition and pointed out that Li Chunhua had beaten and coerced her husband, causing his death, and she requested justice from the District Court. At the same time, the First Sub-precinct of the First District also investigated the previous events, fearing that it was a fabricated myth to conceal homicide, and ordered Gu Tiyun, the neighborhood chief of the Twelfth Ward, to report the death to the District Court for inspection. An official was dispatched to examine the body and confirmed that it was a death due to illness. An order was issued to collect the body, and an investigation was ordered to determine if there was any coercion or violence involved.</p>
<h3>A Beggar Falling on Iron Fence Spikes</h3>
<p>At the Tianhou Palace Bridge and the Waterworks Bridge on Suzhou Creek, there are often beggars who help rickshaw pullers up the bridge slopes and then solicit money from passengers, making it a habit. Yesterday (the 24th) at around 11 AM, a group of beggars were playing by climbing the electric pole made of wood at the south side of the Waterworks Bridge. One beggar, around twenty years old, suddenly lost his grip and fell from a height. The bridge side was surrounded by the Public Works Department's grassland, with a short iron fence around it. The top of the iron bars were like arrowheads. The beggar's waist landed directly on the iron fence spike, causing profuse bleeding and unconsciousness. A policeman saw it and lifted the beggar down, urgently reported to the police station, and sent him to the hospital for treatment by car. However, the injuries were quite serious, and there were fears for his life.</p>
<h3>The Zhoupu Strangled Corpse</h3>
<p>Why Were the Clothes Inside Out?</p>
<p>On the bank of the Caojiazhai River, which is the border of Shangnan in Pudong, a male corpse was found murdered in the early morning. He was about 30 years old, wearing a blue cloth short shirt, lined with a health shirt, and blue cloth pants, lined with two pairs of shorts. However, strangely, the shirt and pants were worn inside out, and it was evident that they were put on after death, or that he was wearing clothes in a rush. His hands and feet were tied with ropes, and his neck was encircled by several strands of hemp rope. It was obvious that he was murdered. The land chief of the Twenty-first Ward and Twenty-second District found no family members to identify the body, so they reported it to the District Court for inspection. Yesterday, Prosecutor Zhao and an examiner arrived at the scene to examine the body and confirmed that it was a case of strangulation. The land chief was ordered to collect the body and await the arrest of the murderer.</p>
<h3>A Gangster Piling On "Three and Earth"</h3>
<p>Lu Liu Fa Seeking Revenge on Qin Xiukun</p>
<p>Qin Xiukun, a worker at the Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Bailianjing, Pudong, used to be a member of the Self-Defense Corps. He was too serious in his duties, which angered the local gangsters. This year, after Qin resigned from the Self-Defense Corps and became unarmed, he was retaliated against by his former enemies. Yesterday, Qin was walking alone in the wilderness east of the factory when Lu Liu Fa and a dozen others surrounded him and beat him. They then lifted him up and threw him down, which is known as "piling on 'Three and Earth'," causing Qin to suffer serious injuries. The gang then dispersed. However, Lu was seen by Qin. Afterwards, his family carried him to the Third Sub-precinct of the Third District to report the incident. The police dispatched officers to arrest Lu and transferred him to the District Court for investigation.</p>

When the patrolmen discovered him, he was already dead. They immediately reported it to the Baojian Road Police Station, who sent detectives to investigate. The deceased was wearing a black cotton shirt and pants, a white cotton shirt, was bald, and wore black socks and black shoes, resembling a peddler. As no family members could be found, the body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall autopsy room.

<h3>Restructuring the Da Lai Bank</h3>
<p>The Da Lai Bank's shares, with a capital of 500,000 yuan, were fully subscribed by the bank's founders. The opening was originally scheduled for June 4th, but on May 27th, two of the bank's directors, Hong Cangting and He Gengxing, suddenly became financially distressed, causing them to default. As a result, the bank, in addition to being affected by the share capital, also had other debt obligations, making it unable to open as scheduled. Currently, the remaining directors of the bank, such as Shen Xingde, Liu Tongjia, Chen Shouzhi, and Zhu Meixian, are all well-known figures in Shanghai's business community and were not deterred by Hong and He's situation. Therefore, yesterday, they held a board meeting to discuss the direction of the bank. The shares that Hong and He were unable to cover were divided up among the directors. After the resolution was passed on the spot, the directors have been working in stages to restructure the bank and plan to convene a shareholders meeting in the coming days to report on the situation, elect replacement directors and supervisors, and set a new date for the opening.</p>

<p>Commercial Press Opens Summer Courses</p>
<h3>Four-Corner Index Compilation Training Institute</h3>
<p>The Commercial Press, since adopting Mr. Wang Yunwu's invented four-corner indexing method to revise the Student Vocabulary and Student Dictionary, has found the method to be quick to use and convenient for all. To promote its widespread adoption, the Press established a Library Internship Class in the summer of the 17th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1928], teaching Wang's new four-corner code indexing method and the new unified book classification method. At that time, many well-known secondary and higher schools, as well as various institutions, selected and sent representatives to participate in the internship, and the results were remarkable. It is reported that the Press plans to go a step further, uniformly adopting the four-corner code indexing method to compile indexes for various dictionaries and reference books in its edition, and appending them to the back of each book for the convenience of all. The Press is taking advantage of the summer vacation to open a Four-Corner Index Compilation Training Institute on July 7th of this year, recruiting students in the third year of junior high school or above as trainees, in order to achieve completion at an early date. This is truly a great contribution to the promotion of culture and efficiency in our country. It is reported that trainees from various places are enthusiastically registering for the internship. The following is an excerpt of the Institute's charter: (1) This session of the Training Institute will run two classes, each with a training period of two weeks. The first class will run from July 7th to July 20th, and the second class will run from July 27th to August 5th. Each person's training period will be one class. (2) Trainees with neat handwriting will be considered qualified. (3) Trainees will be selected by their respective principals from students in the third year of junior high school or above who have this aspiration and are able to work hard. They will be recommended to the Press. Students who wish to study without being recommended by their principal must submit a certificate of completion or graduation certificate from the third year of junior high school or above, and pass the Press's examination to be eligible to participate in the internship. (4) After completing the training period, each trainee will receive a subsidy of 15 national currency units from the Press. During the training period, meals will be provided by the Press. Due to limited space in the dormitories, the number of places is limited. (Note) After arriving in Shanghai, trainees should directly contact the Shanggong School in Baoxing West Lane, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor, We are writing in response to the report in your esteemed newspaper on June 24th, which reprinted an article from the Da Wan Bao. After reading it, our association was deeply concerned that it would lead to accidents. We immediately sent personnel to various rickshaw companies to conduct a thorough investigation. According to the executives of each company, the price of gold has risen sharply recently, and the cost of materials is high. The daily rickshaw rental income is insufficient to cover expenses, so they have had no choice but to increase the original price of eight dimes per rickshaw by five cents to supplement their income, effective from May 20th. There was no increase to thirteen dimes as reported. The statements made are inconsistent with the facts. Our association has verified this and hereby requests your esteemed newspaper to make a correction to avoid misunderstandings and to be cautious. Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Union.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor: I am writing to you regarding the article published in your newspaper on the 16th of this month concerning Zhang Zhengming. I was extremely surprised to read it. My late father suffered from a hernia. Whenever he exerted himself, the old ailment would recur. On the 14th, he accepted an invitation from the Li family at No. 16, Huanghe Road, Meifu Road, to settle the employment of Xingdou. He returned home at 11 p.m. that evening. Due to his labor throughout the day, the old ailment flared up. Although Dr. Chen Yilong was called in to treat him, he died of his illness at 11 a.m. on the 15th. There was no other reason. I am deeply concerned that others may misunderstand the truth and cause misunderstandings. Therefore, I am writing to your editor to make a correction in order to uphold my late father's reputation. I am most grateful. Respectfully, Zhang Yanling, June 24th, resident of No. 125, Nancang Street, Nanshi.</p>

<p>B: I wish I could. If I could walk in my sleep, I'd apply to the police station to be a night patrol officer. That would be an extra source of income.</p>
<p>A: You're an old bachelor. How would you understand a woman's mind? You know, everything about women is complicated.</p>
<p>B: I'm still an old bachelor precisely because I understand women too well.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Memorial for Martyr Fan Tang Tie</h3>
<p>The martyr's name was ZhengLuo, a native of Xiuwu County, Henan Province, and the youngest brother of Mr. Fan Zhengbo, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters. He was young, ambitious, of pure character, and unwavering in his devotion to the Three People's Principles. Therefore, he was courageous, loyal, and resolute in eradicating traitors. He was also sincere and affectionate in his dealings with others. He served as an assistant officer in the City Training Department and as an investigator in the Public Security Bureau. He was diligent in his duties and dedicated to serving the Party, regardless of his personal safety. Although reactionaries hated him deeply, the martyr always dismissed them with a smile, not taking it to heart. His spirit of struggle and heroic, outstanding qualities were not only rare at the time, but also made him an invaluable asset to the Party. Last August, he returned to his hometown and married Ms. Zhang Wenhua. Before the honeymoon was over, he packed his bags and came to Shanghai to resume his original position. His dedication to the Party and the country, without prioritizing his family, was particularly admirable. Unfortunately, on the evening of November 11th, reactionaries ambushed him at his private residence in the Hehe Lane on Huanlong Road in the French Concession. The news shook the entire city. More than half a year has passed, and comrades in the Party still mourn him incessantly. Therefore, yesterday, the 22nd, Mr. Ying Peng of the City Supervisory Committee, along with comrades from the entire city, privately initiated a memorial service for Martyr Fan. The venue was the auditorium on the third floor of the City Party Headquarters. In the center was a portrait of the martyr, and on both sides were displayed the martyr's clothes and shoes from the time of his death. The bloodstains and bullet holes were vividly visible, causing deep sorrow. The meeting began at 10 a.m. Attendees included Mr. Yu Hongjun, representative of Mayor Zhang Qun, Public Security Bureau Chief Yuan Liang, Social Bureau Chief Pan Gongzhan, Education Bureau Chief Chen Dezheng, as well as representatives from various organizations and his relatives and friends, numbering several hundred. First,</p>
<h3>Common Sense for Small Office Workers · Wang · Xin · Bao</h3>
<p>You should compare yourself to a screw on a machine. Although the position is small, the responsibility is not.</p>
<p>Do not estimate the value of others, do not complain about the smallness of your salary. If you really do your job diligently, your leader will never let you down.</p>
<p>The person who is initially the best to you often ends up being the person you resent the most. "The friendship of gentlemen is as light as water." Reiterate this saying.</p>
<p>You should be particularly respectful of people in the same position as you who are much older than you. Because even if their talents are not as good as yours, their experience is bound to be higher than yours.</p>
<p>If people treat you with one point of sincerity, you double it. Even if you can't form a deep friendship, at the very least they will recognize you as an honest person.</p>
<p>If a colleague invites you to accompany the leader to a banquet, you rush to pay the bill. This is not polite. This is absurd.</p>
<p>If you run into the leader in an entertainment venue, you rush to pay the bill. This is also not polite. This is annoying.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Yingpeng presided over the meeting, and formalities were observed as usual. Then, Comrade Chen Kecheng reported on the martyr's heroic deeds. Directors Yuan, Pan, and Chen, as well as Mr. Tao Baichuan, a member of the Civil Training Association, all gave extremely somber speeches. Finally, Mr. Fan Zhengbo gave a thank you address. As soon as Mr. Fan stepped onto the stage, he bowed three times to the martyr's portrait, then burst into tears, unable to speak due to grief. This showed the depth of his brotherly love. The guests could not bear to hear him. The atmosphere of the meeting was solemn and respectful, filled with mourning. The music was slow and mournful. Couplets and elegies lined the four walls, filled with sorrow. For example, Mayor Zhang Lianyun wrote: "The sudden change shocks the heart, causing the pigeon plains to lose their wings; a young man carries his ambition, enduring the plum rains to invoke his soul." Director Yuan wrote in his couplet: "The beautiful couple has just been blessed, how could they lightly abandon their promising youth? They did not hesitate to forget themselves for the Party and the country; the phoenix fell on the Ping Slope, and his face is still visible, leaving a magnificent spirit to strengthen the mountains and rivers." Committee Member Zhu wrote in his couplet: "Loyalty is exclusively attributed to you, whenever we gathered and declared, you only knew the Party; even on your deathbed you entrusted me, and these items left behind are enough to show your affection." I also offered a couplet: "The world is not yet clear, the pure Fan Pang has passed away, and it is because of the Party's affairs that my heart is often filled with sorrow; Tang Qu shed tears, not out of personal feelings." Many other eulogies and couplets were presented by various organizations and district party headquarters throughout the city. The beauty was overwhelming. Due to space limitations, I will not record them all here. I heard that there will soon be a grand memorial service held by the City Department, which will also honor Martyr Guo Qingzhao.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Zhao Sheng Park in Zhenjiang Ma Xiezhong</h3>
<p>My city has the name of the Iron Walled City and boasts the scenic beauty of Golden Jiao. To the south is the beautiful landscape of Zhao Yingyin, and to the north are the scenic wonders of North Solid Mountain. Unfortunately, they are too far from the city to be easily accessible. Now, fortunately, outside the west city, next to South Ma Road, there is the establishment of Zhao Sheng (Martyr) Park. The location is convenient for transportation, which is pleasing to tourists. At the intersection of spring and summer, I returned to my hometown for two days on official business. By chance, I received an invitation from a high-ranking friend, so we went together. Although the facilities in the park are not yet complete, the exterior is magnificent. Among them, grass and trees grow luxuriantly, wild flowers bloom, strange rocks stand in rows, and green leaves cover the sun, making the place quiet and enviable. Next to the park are several houses, which are the Happy Forest Teahouse and the Lingyan Pavilion Photo Studio. Their architecture is also quite elegant, worthy of adorning the park. To the west, the famous Silver Screen Mountain stands majestically. The mountain is full of bamboo forests, clear and green, as if dripping with water. Climbing to its summit, one can see the Iron Walled City in all its glory, embrace distant mountains, and swallow the Yangtze River. The vastness is refreshing and exhilarating, giving one the feeling of being in Penglai. At the foot of the mountain is a small pond with a pool of clear water, where fish swim in and out. Next to it is a small house, shaped like a swallow's wing, which is the public lecture hall. Entering it, the windows are bright, the tables are clean, and the order is well-maintained, so I rested there for a while. In addition, there are several pavilions, all of which are attractive. Unfortunately, the setting sun was to the west, and the twilight urged me to return. Tourists scattered in all directions, so I did not climb any further. By the time I returned to my residence, the lights of thousands of homes were already lit.</p>
<h3>News from the Lake Hills Lake Oriole</h3>
<p>Recalling this day last year, it was the opening period of the West Lake Exposition. The Gushan area was filled with traffic and crowded with tourists. The atmosphere was extremely lively and grand. Now, the closing has been long over, and various temporary buildings have been demolished one after another. Therefore, it has taken on a new look. I will record what I have recently seen and heard below. The main gate of the former West Lake Exposition was dismantled several weeks ago, widening the road. The magnificent and novel buildings can only be seen in photographs.</p>
<p>To the left of Broken Bridge, there used to be a pavilion with an ancient stone tablet inside. It has been there for a long time. For some unknown reason, it was suddenly demolished the other day. Where the ancient stone tablet has been transported to is unknown. It is a very disappointing act. It is likely that this pavilion was sacrificed for the sake of traffic.</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Power Plant has newly established a user entertainment cinema. The cinema is located in the former West Lake Grand Auditorium. The architecture and equipment can be said to be complete. It is truly Hangzhou's most elegant entertainment venue. The films shown are also European and Western masterpieces, such as Janet Gaynor's "Seventh Heaven" and Bibi Daniels' "Big Girl," which have already been shown to the people of Hangzhou.</p>
<p>The bronze statue of Mr. Chen Yingshi, a revolutionary martyr who stood up on Wu Mountain, is located on the lakeside. It has been completed for a year. Now, exotic flowers and plants have been added around the stone base, and it is surrounded by iron railings, making it more spectacular than before. It is a pity that the bronze statue is heavily exposed to sunlight and sand, and the color is dull. It seems that it must be painted.</p>
<p>The memorial tower for the fallen soldiers on the lakeside has been largely completed for a long time. Now, the inscriptions on all four sides have been completed. The characters are made of gold, which is extremely beautiful in contrast to the purple and green marble. Glass bricks have been laid on top of the stone base. At night, the electric torches emit light, creating a colorful and amazing spectacle.</p>
<h3>Recording Their Private Desires Xin Fu</h3>
<p>Today's world is a world of private desires. I ask among humanity, regardless of wisdom, foolishness, age, is there anyone who can abandon private desires? Recently, the American film industry, in view of this, has made the film "Their Private Desires" and released it to the world. They call it "their" private desires instead of "his" private desires, perhaps because "their" private desires are even greater than "theirs." This film is the latest production of the Metro Company, completely with song, dance, and dialogue. The plot is bizarre and does not fall into the usual clichés. Moreover, it can exploit their private desires to the fullest, making people think deeply. The star is the famous actress Norma Shearer, who plays a new-style woman in this film. The performance is profound, making people's hearts beat and move. The singing is also melodious, making people intoxicated. Moreover, she is known in Hollywood for her swimming skills. Now, in a vast and boundless lake, she performs amazing swimming techniques, which is rare to see. In addition, supporting actors such as Louis Stone are all outstanding on the screen. So they complement each other. Eighty percent of the background is shot outdoors, with beautiful mountains and rivers and excellent scenery, making the audience feel as if they are on the shores of Lake Geneva in Switzerland. A lonely boat floundering in the stormy waves is even more frightening. There is also a scene where dozens of singers dance on the lakeside, their beautiful shadows reflected in the lake bottom, which is truly a magnificent sight. It is heard that the film is being shown at the Nanjing Grand Theater.</p>

<p>Chapter Twelve: Farewell Banquet, Farewell Wine, Plucking Flowers to Keep a Pretty Shadow; Famous Garden Gathering, Tea Competition to See Beautiful Postures</p>
<p>Zuo Shichen said, "That's wonderful. In fact, she's still completely a child. When she first enters the door, it's naturally much better to have you take care of her at any time." A Jin said, "That's not necessarily the case. In short, Young Master Zhang, although he's a wealthy man, is really a good person. His age is naturally a bit older, but taking a concubine at this age can't be considered too old. There are people who take concubines at the age of sixty or seventy." "There's also a funny story today," A Jin said, squinting at Ruiyun as she spoke, "Are you going to tell Second Young Master?" Ruiyun said, "Tell him if you want. Anyway, he's 'standing in the clouds watching the fight.' It's all none of his business." When Ruiyun said this, she seemed to flash a contemptuous, slightly angry look. A Jin said, "There's a guest named Gui, from Ningbo. His friends all call him A Gui. A Gui has become his name. Even the brothel calls him A Gui now. He's only called a few girls to sing, and he hasn't invited any guests. He's really handsome, and he's young. He's really a pretty boy. Today, he came to the business early in the morning with a Zhao who's called 'Big Head Zhao.' At that time, the eldest mistress hadn't come out of the small room. The two of them pulled me into a small room, and Big Head Zhao asked me, 'Is it true that your girl is going to get married?' I had no choice but to say I didn't know. Whether she gets married or not is up to her mother. He said, 'Why are you playing dumb? Everyone outside knows it. You're with the girl all day long. How could you not know? I heard that she's already been given five hundred dollars in earnest money. But why is the girl going to marry this nouveau riche? Now, Young Master Gui also wants your girl. How much money will they offer? Young Master Gui is willing to offer as much money as they offer. You can go and talk to the eldest mistress and return the five hundred dollars in earnest money. Young Master Gui is such a person. He's handsome and young. Even a blind man would grope for Young Master Gui.' I said I don't care about this matter. You go and talk to the eldest mistress yourself." Big Head Zhao said, "Ask the girl and see. The girl will definitely agree. As long as the girl is willing, we'll hire lawyers and detectives and pull her out." I thought this was not good. Don't let it become true. But the girl said that A Gui is a garbage cart, a frivolous and impractical person. I told the eldest mistress, and the eldest mistress is a bit timid. That's why Mom is only calling a few girls to sing today. She might not call any tomorrow. Tell you, Second Young Master, the girl might not live at the business tomorrow." Zuo Shichen said, "Oh, then it will be very difficult to see you from tomorrow." Ruiyun said, "If you want to come, you can ask A Jin. A Jin will tell you." Zuo Shichen shook his head and said, "Then it's inconvenient for me to come." He raised half a glass of port wine in a tall glass. Ruiyun also spontaneously raised her half-glass of mint liqueur in front of her. Zuo Shichen said, "Well, then we'll say goodbye in this glass of wine."</p>

<h3>Gold Price Exceeds All Expectations</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 24th), the surge in gold prices continued fiercely and relentlessly. However, the market was complex, with prices fluctuating frequently by three to four taels, causing confusion. In the morning, the price hovered around 610 taels, but in the afternoon, the trend became increasingly bullish, showing a clear upward trajectory. Throughout the day, the price fluctuated by a total of eleven taels. Foreign exchange rates had already quietly strengthened. Banks were selling, but the asking price increased by one notch. Trading among various firms remained strong, with Tai Hing, Wan Hing, and Tian Yu, among others, buying in, while Yuan Mao, Shui Xiang, and Yu Shun Li sold out. Fu Chang, Zhi Feng, Yong, and others had inconsistent supply and demand. From the early morning, large bars of silver rose slightly, and buyers were persistent, so prices rose instead. Then, they softened slightly before recovering well. In the afternoon, Tai Hing, Heng Hing, Yu Da, and others all bought in, while Yuan Mao, Yong Sheng, Da, and others sold out. The price increase seemed to be due to diligent buying, fueled by rumors that cash was being exported. This triggered an excited psychological response among the public, resulting in a significant surge of eight to nine taels, reaching a peak of 619 taels. Although there were occasional dips of two to three taels, the upward trend was rapid. Exchange rates were also generally strong, but the market was highly volatile and unpredictable. Yesterday, large bars of silver increased by an eighth, and the silver market increased by three-eighths.</p>
<p>Exposing the signs of a surge, the opening price for August was 609 taels and 4 mace, an increase of 1 tael and 4 mace. Gross prices fluctuated by 2 taels, increasing from 608 taels and 1 mace to 10 shillings. Although the announced increase of 25 was already higher, the US dollar was at 50 cents and the Japanese yen was quoted at a small 2 fen, but this had no impact. The domestic market was firm due to eager buyers. The Shanghai price for September was 6 pence, and the Taiwan price was 5 pence at 9375, further increasing by 3 taels, reaching 13 taels, 1 mace, and 2 candareens. Later, the bank sold US dollars for August at $36.1875, and for October, the exchange rate was $36.4375, so the downstream was slightly lower. From 9:30 AM onwards, there were fluctuations of 2-3 taels, and Zhi Feng, Yong, and others sold some. Until after 11:00 AM, the underlying trend weakened, and the major firm, Fu Chang, and others sold. The price fell by more than 4 taels, but the exchange rate trading was not strong, at 608 taels and 4 mace. Suddenly, it jumped up by 3 taels at 11:30 AM, to 11 taels and 4 mace, as some people chased the price. At noon, short sellers made small profits, so it rose again to 609 taels, 3 mace, and 4 candareens. At the noon closing, the price was 610 taels and 4 candareens.</p>
<p>The closing price was raised to 18 taels and 8 candareens. The post-market opening price was 610 taels and 9 candareens. Later, major firms enthusiastically bought in, including Tai Hing, and there were rumors that cash was being exported again. Public sentiment soared, and foreign exchange rates were especially strong. Recently, the Japanese yen was accepted by the bank at 1 tael, 3 mace, 6 fen, 3 li, 7 hao, and 5 si. August shillings were offered by Jardine Matheson and Mitsui at 5 pence and 875. Suddenly, a fierce surge of 6 taels occurred. After 3:00 PM, due to the large rebound in Indian exchange rates, Fu Chang and others sold, so the price retreated by 3 taels. At 3:50 PM, it was 14 taels and 2 candareens. At this time, Heng Hing bought in, and afterwards, the price fluctuated between 14 and 15 taels. After 4:00 PM, the storm became even more intense, and the market sentiment was resilient. Those with long positions raised prices and did not let go. British gold was even stronger, and the banks were very bullish, so the price was pushed up by 4 taels and several candareens. By the time the market closed, a remarkable price of 19 taels appeared, and the closing price at 4:30 PM was 618 taels and 8 candareens.</p>
<p>Doing the math, 50 taels deducted, compared with the 23rd, there was a rise of more than 10 taels and 8 candareens. The largest price fluctuation in one day was 19 taels, and the smallest was 8 taels and 1 candareen, a difference of 10 taels and 9 candareens. Therefore, both the morning and afternoon markets rose. In the morning, July was at 608 taels, and August was at 10 taels. In the afternoon, July was at 13 taels, and August was at 15 taels. The make-up water in the morning was 8 taels, and in the afternoon, it was 13 taels. The quoted price was changed to 667 taels and 8, a small decrease of fifty-seven to eighty taels. In the afternoon, the calculation was approximately 50 taels deducted. Early opening for goods was 9 taels and 2 candareens, the noon closing was 10 taels and 7 candareens, the afternoon was 10 taels and 8 candareens, and the closing price was 18 taels.</p>
<p>Guangdong firms sold less and bought more. Among the firms engaged in inter-dealer trading, Fu Chang, Zhi Feng Yong, Heng Xing Fu Yu, and Yuan Tai had varying degrees of buying and selling. Da De Cheng, Xiang Yu Yu Da, Yuan Mao, and Yong Jun sold, while Wan Xing, Yuan Xing Yong, Tai Hing, Tian Yu Yong, and Yuan Kang Xiang bought. In the afternoon, Tai Hing, Yuan Cheng Yong Shun Li all bought, while Wan Xing, Sheng Da, Yi Yu, Fu Chang, and Xiang Yu all sold. Heng Xing sold less and bought more. Furthermore, various firms bought and sold from time to time, with varying intentions. Dalian firms sold over 800 bars and bought 500-600 bars. Guangdong firms sold less and bought more, totaling about 2,000 bars.</p>
<h3>Discrepancies between Official and Black Market Foreign Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the HSBC official exchange rates for various currencies were raised by one level, likely due to the increase in silver prices. The British pound increased by 25, to 1 shilling, 5 pence, and 625. The US dollar increased by half a yuan, to 35 yuan and 625. The Indian rupee increased by half a yuan, to 98 rupees.

The Hong Kong dollar increased by 5 mace, to 85 taels and 5 mace. The internal market, on the other hand, trended towards tightness, especially in the afternoon. The official and black market rates diverged even further, and the gold price surge intensified, brightening the market. Chinese speculators and Heng Hing, Fu Chang, Dalian firms, and others have been buying in. Banks' psychology is very strong, British gold traded more than 200,000 pounds, and Mekka, Taiwan, Mitsui, Sumitomo, and Dong-A all sold more than 100,000 pounds. However, Shanghai slightly bought in 50,000-60,000 pounds from each other and traded 100,000 US dollars. Jin industry also bought in 200,000 dollars. Sumitomo Korea sold out, and Japanese gold only sold tens of thousands of dollars in the current period, which was received by Mitsui and Zhengjin. As a result, compared to the previous day, the yuan shrank by 25, the US dollar shrank by 50 cents, and the Japanese yen rose by 2 fen. People are determined in the morning, and the market is sharp.</p>

<h3>Interest Rates Firm and Discounts Increase</h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday, the increase in interest rates appeared to ease slightly, but demand remained strong, and public sentiment was still high. Fortunately, small amounts of funds continued to arrive from nearby ports, and funds accumulated from this street were sufficient to compensate. In addition, the amount of money collected by the same industry every day can offset, so the supply is still abundant. As a result, the upward trend stopped suddenly, and prices fell by 7 mace and a half. However, as the half-year closing date approaches, and the difference in the amount collected is large, the trend is still on the rise.</p>
<p>Interest Rates (Foreign Interest): The early market was 7 mace, 2 fen, 3 li, 6 hao, 2 si, and a half, slightly lower than the high price in the afternoon market of the previous day by 6 hao, 2 si, and a half. The afternoon market recovered slightly by 1 hao and 2 si and a half, to 7 mace, 2 fen, 3 li, and a half. However, the trend of sentiment is still not soft or stagnant, and there may be another round of excitement in the future. (Silver Discount) The early market was 1 mace and 8 fen, up 6 fen from the previous morning. The afternoon market fell by 3 fen, at 1 mace and 5 fen. The bank quoted 7 fen. With more money being paid out, the money market was flooded, resulting in a white-out.</p>
<p>Auxiliary Currency Market: There are very few Jiangnan small foreign coins on the market, and transactions are rare, so the market price has no competition, and there is no difference. The early market was 6 mace, 3 fen, 7 li, and the afternoon market was 6 mace, 3 fen, 6 li, and a half. The transactions were 1,000 corners in the early market and 1,500 corners in the afternoon market. Guangdong small foreign coins also went down, with the early market at 6 mace, 0 li, and 1 fen and a half, and the afternoon market at 6 mace, 0 li, 0 hao, 8 si, and 7 hu and a half, a sharp drop of 2 li, 3 hao, and 7 hu and a half compared to the previous afternoon. The transactions were 120,000 corners in the early market and 75,000 corners in the afternoon market. Copper coins shrank by another 4,000, to 397,000.</p>
<p>Silver Deposits and Withdrawals: Yesterday, the bank's collection was less than the previous day, Monday, but there were quite a few withdrawals, so the money market had ample funds. Chinese merchants collected 1.78 million, foreign merchants collected 1.8 million, special withdrawals were 1.5 million, settlements were 1 million, and various goods, exchanges, customs duties, mortgages, and other collections were 8.78 million, with 1.1 million leaving the warehouse. Japanese banks collected 4.7 million, and 500,000 entered the warehouse. Qianzhuang and Yin Gong companies collected 41.1 million, and the number of items collected reached 2.8 million. Remittances collected 700,000, and cash collected 500-600,000.</p>

Outside the market, banknotes traded 185,000 in early trading and 173,000 in afternoon trading. Actual foreign currency traded 140,000 in early trading and 210,000 in afternoon trading. Sun Yat-sen new currency was 50,000, and Yuan coins were 40,000. Bank trading was 750,000 in the early market and 500,000 in the afternoon market. Foreign banks bought in 300,000, and the turnover of foreign accounts between banks was 1.4 million, with banknotes entering and exiting 1 million, and 400,000 from customers. There were a total of 3.45 million in new currency, cash, and banknotes shipped to Shantou, Xiamen, Guangdong, the North Road, the inland, and Hankou. Qianzhuang Yang Gong companies collected 4.78 million, and Yang items collected over 2.2 million. Foreign currency loans amounted to 1.4 million, and small qianzhuang traded banknotes for cash, new currency exchange heads, and other transactions for 500-600,000.</p>
<h3>Yuan Coins Add Water and Rise Again</h3>
<p>Since Shanghai changed to casting the Sun Yat-sen new currency, Yuan coins have become scarce because production has been suspended and outflow has increased. In the past, when Guangdong firms enthusiastically purchased them, the added water was as high as 6, 7, or 8 li. Later, sales stagnated, and the added water leveled off. In the first half of this year, there was no significant added water, and even if there was, it was only half a li or a few hao. However, suddenly yesterday, there was a new outlet, and buyers were enthusiastic, so the added water rose again to 2-3 li, and the highest rose to 4 li and a half. At yesterday's market price, it was 7 mace, 2 fen, and 8 li, which can be described as an unexpected and drastic change.</p>
<h3>Securities Flat, Bond Market Up in Morning, Down in Afternoon</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The previous session's customs duty futures were 627, demobilization futures were 629, the Nine-Six near-term was 147, the spot price was 146, and a total of 175,000 were sold.

(Dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<h3>Bond Market Lacks Development</h3>
<p>Prices Also Slightly Lower… Minimal Movement</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot market for public bonds remained deserted. A total of 11,800 packages were traded in the morning and afternoon. The futures market was also relatively calm. The enthusiasm of buyers and sellers was flagging. The bond market environment was generally gloomy, with little new development. The settlement period was approaching, so major firms were watching and waiting, and there were no significant inflows or outflows. Bond prices also stagnated, fluctuating by only about half a yuan throughout the day. This calm situation was unprecedented in recent times. Compared to the previous day, the six-month rehabilitation futures fell by 1 yuan and 30 cents. The seven-year rehabilitation spot price was significantly higher than on the previous Friday, but other issues were generally weak, with price movements of only 40-50 cents.</p>

<h3>The Collapse of the Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market is Now Apparent</h3>
<p>Japanese Yarn Reaches an Unprecedented Low</p>
<p>Multiple Negative Factors, Poor Atmosphere in the Business World</p>
<p>The yarn market, which has been brewing for a long time, has undergone major changes, mainly affected by the disastrous decline in Japanese Three Goods yarn. Local buyers have been concerned about the issue of expensive gold and cheap silver. Unexpectedly, the sudden drop in Three Goods yarn has caused widespread panic. This month, it has seen 98 yuan, which is rare in history. However, according to the general trend, there are about 300,000 bales of yarn piled up in inventory due to sluggish sales. It is said that there is no way to deal with the price of Three Goods yarn for the time being. Therefore, buyers, considering the harsh environment, had to reluctantly close their positions. On the long side, a total of 16,350 bales were sold in the morning and afternoon markets, but Hengda Manufacturers alone bought 8,350 bales. The atmosphere in the business world is unusually tense. In terms of the overall situation of the yarn market, there is still a sharp decline in the future.</p>
<p>Multiple Parties Greatly Spitting Out, Hengda's Absorptive Power is Also Strong. The Opening Price in the Previous Session, Due to the Drop in US Cotton, the Market Sentiment Reached an Extreme. The Majority of the Longs Did Not Limit Prices to Sell. Each Month Fell by 7-8 Cents. However, Hengda Manufacturers Purchased 250 Bales per Session. The Market Price Stabilized Slightly and Rose Slightly. As a Result, Each Rose by 1, 2, and 3 Cents. Hengda Purchased 4,350 Bales. Da Ji Entered 2,250 Bales and Sold Yi Cheng 1,000 Bales, Yi Chang 1,150 Bales, Chang Feng 1,050 Bales, Tian Chang 4,050 Bales, and Li Chang 3,800 Bales. In the Afternoon, the Current Month of Three Goods Yarn Fell into 100 Yuan. People's Hearts in the Customs Became More Frightened. Each Fell by 7-8 Cents. However, the Longs Still Closed Out in Large Quantities. Hengda Still Purchased 4,000 Bales. Shen Xin Entered 1,600 Bales. Da Feng Entered 1,350 Bales and Sold Li Chang 4,600 Bales, Yi Cheng 1,800 Bales, Tian Long 1,050 Bales, and Da Chang Cheng 1,600 Bales. As a Result, Each Fell by 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 Cents. The Total Transaction Volume for the Day Was 47,850 Bales. The Closing Price for Each Session is Recorded on the Left</p>

The Most Purchases Were Made by Customers from the Sichuan Trade Association, Totaling 210 Bales. In Addition, Guangdong Entered 145 Bales, Qinhuangdao Entered 55 Bales, Inland Entered 150 Bales, Yantai Entered 30 Bales, Hankou Entered 55 Bales, Tianjin Entered 30 Bales, Hong Kong Entered 150 Bales, and Other Trade Associations Entered 65 Bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Turns Stable, Actual Demand is Quiet</h3>
<p>US Cotton Cables Still Fall. Local Spot Cotton Sales are Quiet. In Fact, the Bottom Cargo is Thin. The Han Gang Still Has the Intention to Buy When Falling. Retail Investors See the Situation as Strong and Dare Not Sell Off Rashly. Therefore, the Market Air is Slightly More Expensive Than the Yarn Market. However, the Yarn Price is Not Good, and the World Cotton Industry is Weak. The Number of Yarn Factories That Have Stopped Work is Increasing. Consumption Will Decrease. It is Difficult to Rise.</p>
<p>Han Standard Lichang My Head Closed One After Another. The Han Standard Market Opened in the Previous Market, and the Market Air Was Strong. Because There Was a Lack of Sellers, Each Month Rose by 5 Points to 2.5 Cents. However, Lichang Many Head Closed a Lot. In the Afternoon, the Situation Was Still Expensive. Lichang Also Closed 10,700 Dan. The Purchases Were All Retail Investors. Each Month Rose and Fell by 5 Points to 1 Cent. The Total Transaction Statistics for the Day Were 55,500 Dan.

<p>Spot Cotton Only Package Not Open. Actual Demand is Weak and Abnormal, and People's Hearts are Weak. The Factory Opens and is Silent. Only 1,700 Packages of Yao Flower Arrived at the Dock.</p>
<h3>Japanese Yarn is Transported to China for Sale</h3>
<p>The Reason for the Sharp Drop in Japanese Three Goods Yarn Has Been Briefly Recorded in Yesterday's Newspaper. Yesterday, Three Goods Yarn Fell Another 4 Yuan to 98 Yuan and 5 Angles. The Lowest Peak Was 98 Yuan, Which Was a New Low Price Since 86 Yuan in December 1914. Under These Circumstances, in Addition to Reducing Production to Avoid Increasing Accumulation, How to Reduce a Large Number of Inventories is an Important Issue at Present. Reducing Inventory, Devaluing to Seek Sales and Development is the Only Strategy. Therefore, This Sharp Decline Was an Expected Event. The Statement of Transporting Sales in China Has Become a Fact. It is Reported That Japanese Trading Houses Have Purchased 5,000 Packages to Ship to Shanghai. The 20-Count Baolai and Sanma Opened Yesterday Were Japanese Yarn. The Price is Cheap and the Quality is Excellent. Sales are Easy. This Yarn is Under Pressure, Which is Inevitable.</p>
<h3>The Rise and Fall of World Flower and Yarn are Vastly Different</h3>
<p>The Recent Yarn of Three Goods Fell to 98 Yuan and 5 Angles</p>
<p>The Decline of US Cotton Has Not Weakened. Yesterday, US Cotton Initially Weakened Due to Good Weather and Weakness on Wall Street. Later, a Part of the Short Accounts Compensated and Returned Firm. The Futures Fell by 14 to 22 Pounds Yin. The Spot Fell by 20 Pounds Yin. British Cotton Futures Fell by 20 to 21 Points.

<h3>Grain and Flour Market Disorganized and Essentially Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, both in the morning and afternoon sessions, generally presented a chaotic picture. Initially, the quoted price of foreign wheat was slightly lower again, and the manufacturers also took this opportunity to compress the current month's price. Therefore, they were watching the actual sales, and the sentiment was once weak, reaching a minimum of 2 taels, 5 mace, 2 fen, 2 li, and a half. For the remaining months, because there were many longs returning, the sales were very smooth, and they were also very soft. July was as low as 2 taels and 5 mace, August to 5 mace and 1 fen, and September to 5 mace, 2 fen, and a half, which were 2-3 fen lower than the previous day. However, after the second session in the afternoon, because the inland help considered that the wheat price in the producing area could not be relaxed, the flour price was not too low, so the buying stomach was healthy again, and the market recovered. Judging from the situation after this, the actual sales have not yet started, and this market situation can be circumnavigated. As a result, the current month was 1 fen and 7 li and a half smaller than the previous day, July was 7 li and a half smaller, August and September were 5 li smaller, October was unchanged, and November was better by 5 li.</p>
<h3>Futures and Spot Wheat Fall Together by Two or Three Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat slump has turned into a smooth situation. Because the Wuxi help has always not seen the price of wheat, although there are still many empties from Hankou and Jiangbei, the potential power of one species has not been completely eliminated. Therefore, the morning was three or four minutes better than the previous day. By the afternoon sessions, the flour market was still tired, and the sentiment fell again. The opening prices of each session also fell. As a result, June and November were 2 fen smaller than the previous day, July was 1 fen smaller, and August, September, and October were 3 fen smaller. Spot wheat Because manufacturers have generally increased the number of kills and are unwilling to be greedy, each grade is 2-3 fen smaller than the previous day. A total of 20,000 bags of Kaishashi, Gaoyou, Shaoxing, Yangzhou, Shuangfeng, Penglai, Taicang, Pudong, and Chen Dong wheat were opened, and half of them were taken away by various factories.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Will Arrive in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>More Than 20,000 Bags Have Been Opened on the Road</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot sales of foreign rice were slightly weak, and the total market only opened about 10,000 bags, which were taken away by Ningbo, Wenzhou, this street, and inland. However, the road goods transaction was very good. The cargo owner was willing to sell, and the appetite of the imported households was also fragrant. The number was more than double that of spot goods, and the market was generally flat. Because the current inventory is sufficient, the number of ships arriving within this month and two or three days is about 200,000, and people's hearts are inevitably soft. 15,000 bags of road goods were</p>
<h3>Standard Bean Cake at Two Taels Leaving the Customs</h3>
<p>The Exchange Will Increase Margin Deposits</p>
<p>Yesterday, initial declines in bean cake prices were due to some hoarders closing out their long positions, dropping by a small fraction of 1.5 fen. In the afternoon, with urgent telegrams arriving, the appetite from rural areas intensified, and the situation rebounded. Near-term contracts opened at 1 tael and 9.9 fen, while distant contracts remained at 2 taels and 0.1 fen. As the bean cake market has reached its peak, the exchange believes it is necessary to increase margin deposits and has announced that if the cake price reaches above 2 taels and 0.5 fen, the required margin deposit will be 200 taels per thousand pieces. The price exceeding 2 taels is unprecedented in recent years.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: No Turnaround in European and American Silk Markets</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm silk market showed no signs of recovery. Weak exchange rates and scarce overseas silk telegrams persisted. Chinese silk merchants were reluctant to loosen their holdings, and prices from Europe and America remained low, making it difficult to sell at a loss. Yesterday's market only saw short-covering transactions. Ganli and others took in 20 bales of new factory silk, and Zhonghe and others took in 15 bales of Baiqian silk. Prices remained stable, it was said.</p>
<h3>Pingshui Dabang Tea Market Opens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm tea market saw the opening of the Huzhou Pingshui Dabang tea market by Jinlong Foreign Firm. Prices ranged from 45 taels and 2.5 qian to 46 taels and 2.5 qian, not significantly different from last year. However, American firms are particularly strict in their selection of Dabang tea this year, fearing the inclusion of powdered tea, which would hinder future sales. Luzhuang Zhenmei tea and Gaozhuang tea are selling well, while medium and low-grade teas are sluggish. Yesterday, more Wuyuan Beixiang tea arrived in Shanghai, and samples should be available today. Xingcheng Tianxiang and other firms showed a slight appetite for Qimen black tea, but the selling price was 4-5 taels lower than before, it was said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Granulated Sugar Drops by 1 Qian</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Cuban spot sugar was at 1.25, New York September price at 1.34, December at 1.44, March at 1.53, May at 1.60, each down 4 points. Java spot and futures sugar prices remained unchanged. The public association's buying interest in coarse granulated white sugar was scarce, with many sellers, and the market showed signs of decline. The transaction price fell to 7 taels and 9, down 1 qian from the previous day. Medium granulated white sugar also followed the decline, with few transactions. Japanese sugar YP mark was at 8 taels and 5.5 qian, YT mark at 8 taels and 3.5 qian, and the market was flat and weak. YRO mark was in demand due to a shortage of goods, with transactions at 8 taels and 2 qian. Meiji goods were at 8 taels and 2.5 qian, still considered attractive. Although there was talk of a price increase for Taikoo sugar, it was difficult to realize immediately. Hao Pan offered dozens of packages of domestic Mianhu red sugar at 7 taels and 7.5 qian, which was suitable for Hangzhou firms. Ban Nanqing offered over a hundred packages at 5 taels and 9, and the market was not weak. After Cuban foreign firms opened at 7 taels and 1 qian, they raised it by 2 qian yesterday. Zhenxiang Company sold 1,000 bags at 7 taels and 3 qian, needed for northern routes, but the market atmosphere considered the price too high, flat, and unsurprising, it was said.</p>
<h3>Metals: English Tinplate Soars</h3>
<p>The recent trend of English tinplate is very good. Although arrivals are frequent, exports are very enthusiastic, and the local market also uses it widely, so there is no worry of overstocking. Recently, the emerging paint sector has been actively buying, so transactions are very numerous. The market is trending upward due to environmental factors, with great potential for soaring prices. Ninety-pound boxes are estimated at 14 taels each, and one hundred-pound boxes are estimated at 15 taels each. Transactions are particularly active for ninety-pound boxes, it was said.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Graduates' Future</h3>
<p>In the newspapers these days, we can find a seemingly special news item, which is the graduation ceremony of various schools. Our school also held it a few days ago. There were more than forty graduates in various departments. After the variety show, several of us undergraduates invited some of the graduating classmates we knew well to hold a small farewell party. We had been together day and night, and now the farewell song was sung suddenly, and we truly felt "a song of Hemanzi, tears falling before you." We looked at each other sadly for a long time, and then discussed the issue of the future. "I say," a graduate student seemed to stand up with some emotion, "I'm not trying to be sarcastic, really, it's better for you who haven't graduated yet. I used to think that way too, that graduation is the happiest thing, but now I think it's the most depressing thing." He took a breath and continued, "Because, before graduating, you can still study in peace. Now that you've graduated, you don't have money to study abroad. Your family expects that graduating from university is like passing the imperial examination in the Qing Dynasty, and you can be promoted and become rich from then on. But in fact, now it's not even easy to find a teaching position. The future is really bleak. Do you think it's happy or depressing?" As far as I know, among the graduates this time, less than ten have found a job, and most of these jobs are unrelated to what they studied. Our school has literature, law, science, and education departments. This time, there are more graduates from the education department, followed by the law and literature departments, and the fewest from the science department. Now most of them are equally depressed. Zhao, who lives in our room, is from Anhui and also graduated this time. In the past half month, we've seen him almost go crazy. He spends all day writing letters and visiting people. However, although most of the letters he sends are sent by registered mail, there are very few replies. When he goes to visit people, he is always excited and spends a long time getting his hair and suit straight and smooth. Then he smiles and says to us, "Goodbye for now," and leaves. But when he comes back, he throws his suit aside without a word and lies on the bed. "Lao Zhao, what's wrong?" Sometimes we ask him, but he buries his head in the quilt and sighs. "This is probably because he ran into a wall while trying to ask someone for a job, or at least there were no results," we whispered to each other. But this is still considered good. He still has friends to write to and important people to visit, even though he hasn't succeeded. As for Xiao Chen, my fellow villager from Hunan, who also graduated this year, he doesn't have a single good friend or relative and just sits in the room all day sighing. "Lao Zhang, this time I'll have to go home and eat old rice," he said to me sadly one day, "But what face do I have? And Hunan is now a world of soldiers and bandits." I was also moved by him and couldn't help but shed tears, because on the one hand, my fellow villager is indeed pitiful, but mainly I am saddened for myself, because I am also graduating soon, and the result of graduation seems to be just like this. At the same time, I imagine that this year's graduates are just these in our school, but if we combine all the schools in Shanghai, there are many people. How many of these many people can be chosen as "sons of heaven"? I think most people will taste the pain of unemployment, and many of us undergraduates who still have golden dreams will soon be irresistibly subjected to the same fate. Our schooling was hard-won, and many of us have tasted the pain of dropping out of school. But now that we have tasted the pain of dropping out of school, we will have to taste the pain of unemployment again, and who knows if there are other pains waiting for us after the pain of unemployment? Ah, I really don't want to think about it anymore. However, the future of these graduating students is still a problem and worth discussing.</p>
<p>We know that the panic of unemployment has become a common danger in modern times, and it is even worse in China, a weak nation. This is naturally because the nation has been oppressed by capitalist imperialism, which has led to political instability and economic underdevelopment. Especially today, the country is plagued by wars and bandits are like hair. Natural disasters such as floods and droughts, epidemics, and famines are almost everywhere. Industrial and commercial enterprises are at the mercy of imperialism. For example, the recent situation of expensive gold and cheap silver has caused unprecedented losses. Under such circumstances, where the country has no choice but to implement a tightening policy, the future of graduates is naturally a difficult problem to solve. However, we feel that young people are the backbone of society, and young people who have received university education are especially outstanding. If they are abandoned and allowed to sink and fall into despair, or even take risks, it will not only damage the vitality of the nation, but also be a great harm to society. Therefore, at present, we need to demand that society have a proper placement, so that "everyone can make the best use of their talents" to develop society. At the same time, every young person should also understand that China has been in a semi-colonial position for a long time, and all the current chaos is caused by the fact that the nation has not yet fully achieved independence. Now, if we want to solve all the problems, especially our own problems of the future, we must firmly grasp the national consciousness and use it as the center of all our thoughts and actions to move forward. Only then will we have a real way out. If we don't do this and rely solely on some emotional impulses, recklessly destroying ourselves and others because there is no way out, it will not help in the end and will damage the vitality of the nation.</p>
<p>According to recent reports, more than 500 Chinese students studying in Japan have returned to China due to the impact of expensive gold and cheap silver, and they cannot maintain their studies. These 500 people are now facing the same problem of the future. Therefore, we feel that the problem we are discussing is very serious and necessary. Our attitude towards this problem at present is to demand that society provide appropriate relief, but fundamentally, it lies in the urgent need for our young people to awaken their national consciousness and grasp this weapon to bravely fight against all the environments that infringe on our national independence. Young students, graduating students, and students who have been forced to return from Japan, recognize your true way out! The "thousands of houses" that "shelter all the poor scholars in the world and make them happy" are built by our own efforts. (Xian)</p>

<p>Stories from World Literature (171) Written by American Han Maxi, Translated by Hu Zhongchi</p>
<p>Chapter 44: Modern Spanish Literature</p>
<p>Younger than Pereda and Valera, and standing in a position to guide many younger Spaniards, is Galdos. He shows the transition to the modern novel. However, because no one, not even Dante and Goethe, started or ended any literary movement, all talented figures are a transitional period. This is less a transition and more a shift. Galdos sought his subject matter in 19th-century history and created a narrative poem in a series of novels, "National Episodes." The limitation is in the nature of the narrative poem; although it is good material for a romantic novel, it is not as realistic. This remains a rural Spanish style when all of Europe is included. However, there, in what he appropriately called "episodes," are beautiful stories, and he has a talent for character description. Besides his historical stories, he used a lot of subject matter and wrote many novels. He has also been compared to Balzac and Dickens because of the variety of people he described, his knowledge of stories, and his humor.</p>
<p>Valdés, who belongs to the latter half of the previous century, has been criticized for being too influenced by the French. Literary influence is a good thing, not an infringement of national rights. Great writers are often skillful thieves. Valdés is instinctively a good artist. He has a close relationship with French novels, unlike most Spanish writers, who probably lack French precision and evenness. His "Foam" and "Faith" are realistic studies of modern life with a delicate satirical tone.</p>
<p>A woman of genius who can fairly be called the George Sand of Spain is Emilia Pardo Bazán. In terms of her enthusiasm for her country and her people, she is similar to her French sister. In "About My Country," she writes with vivid knowledge of the scene—the scene is northwestern Spain—and with observational sympathy for characters who often have no magic in themselves. In this novel and other novels such as "Mother Nature," she occupies her place among the so-called naturalists. I have not seen these novels translated into English, but something has probably been translated, because among writers and publishers in England and America (that is, readers), interest in Spanish novels is gradually increasing.</p>
<p>The novel, or any form of story, is a literary style that is extremely easy to tame under the sky of another country other than one's own, and the easiest to translate is naturally prose stories. Spanish poetry of the 19th century did not give much impression outside of Spain; on the contrary, it was under the influence of foreigners. The young poet Espronceda of the first half of the same century, like many young poets on the European continent, was a disciple of Byron. He was an arrogant, adventurous revolutionary who was involved in all the political and militant upheavals of the time, so naturally he was inclined to Byron. He was a natural poet; his many activities were just part of his fiery, courageous, and arrogant nature. The other side of that nature flows through his poetry with a clanging sound. All those who are familiar readers of Spanish poetry can testify to this.</p>
<p>In the middle of the same century, a poet who seemed to have given a great impression to Spain and had crossed the mountains and perhaps even the sea (the reason for saying the sea is that most of the Spanish world does not live in Spain) was Campoamor. He, like many poets for centuries, was simply a symbolist. He sang with a short poem that was repeated several times, and he gave that poem a critical name, a name that is no more helpful than names like short poem, ode, or folk song to help us understand the essential material—about the relationship between national thought and eternal thought. I will leave this view to the reader and readers of Spanish who are superior to me. Campoamor was a reader of Horace, Ovid, and Juvenal. I have not seen this poet translated into English, but scattered fragments have probably been translated by later English poets. Why? Because, as mentioned above, interest in Spanish literature is gradually increasing among English-speaking people.</p>

<h3>Business News</h3>
<p>The Hongkou branch of the Guohua Bank announced that the bank opened in December last year at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Qiujiang Road. The business is very prosperous. The internal staff is efficient and can provide customers with considerable convenience. Due to the narrowness of the building, which is not enough for office use, they have selected a stone-vaulted house at the south end of Old Baz Road, which is magnificent and newly renovated. They have also added a vault for customers to store valuables. It is said that other banks in the area do not yet have this facility. They moved in for business the day before yesterday and prepared tea, refreshments, and gifts to thank customers. The place was crowded with vehicles and people, creating a lively scene, it was said.</p>
<p>The Hanli Company announced that the Zhongling machine, a new product of the company, is convenient for printing and is extremely welcomed by all circles. However, some who have not seen it do not yet know that the printing machine has such great functions. Since the exhibition at the Shanghai Public Art Exhibition, the number of visitors has been extremely crowded. They have seen the company's demonstrators printing results on the spot, and the speed is amazing, printing more than 400 sheets per hour, which is exceptionally clear. It is more convenient for all circles to print than any other method, and it is completely domestically produced, enough to defeat imported mimeographs. In recent days, those who have come to the company to purchase have crossed the threshold. In a few days, more than 260 units have been sold, with an income of more than 7,000 yuan. According to the company's inquiry, most of them came to purchase after seeing the printing results at the exhibition, it was said.</p>
<p>Hengxing Advanced Cloud Gauze Old Store on Tianhe Road, Hongkou announced that since the price reduction, the store has been very popular. Now that the weather is hot, many people are going to order, and the store is too busy to handle it. The store recently shipped in a large batch of old-brand cloud gauze woven by famous factories in Guangdong, all made of genuine high-quality pure silk, which can be washed a hundred times without changing, will never fall off, and is shiny, pleasing to the eye, durable, and cool, making it a wonderful product for summer clothing. The original price of 1.1 yuan for the top-brand, never-falling-off motor cloud gauze is reduced to 9 jiao per foot. The original price of 1.6 yuan for the famous brand, 100-wash unchanged new flower cloud gauze is reduced to 1.17 yuan to 1.4 yuan per foot, which purchasers say is really cheap, it was said.</p>
<p>The Central Grand Hotel on Zhengfeng Street, Wuma Road announced that the Central Bookstore, which the hotel has been preparing for a long time, has been set up. The venue is located in the hotel's hall, with comfortable seats, elegant decoration, and sufficient air. It is pleasant and cool to be in it. The storytellers and ballad singers hired, such as Jiang Yifei, Zhao Hesun, Zhang Shaochan, Wang Wuneng, Wang Caiyun, etc., are all top choices. There are as many as five acts in each of the day and night shows, with a comedic act at the end. It is expected that those who have a fondness for the art will flock to it, it was said.</p>
<p>The joint announcement by the companies in this port that sell Bovril beef extract stated that Bovril beef extract is a British product, with its head office in London. The chairman is Sir Luke, who reported at the company's 33rd annual meeting that the sales of Bovril beef extract in 1929 exceeded all previous records. The reason for this achievement is, of course, due to the tonic and nourishing properties of the extract, its great efficacy, and the fact that it is trusted by people. The number of awards Bovril has won over the years is countless, and this time, it won the first prize at the Barcelona competition, which is especially appreciated by the general public. As for the Bovril brand, a few years ago, it may have been suspected of being overvalued, but judging from the current situation, it is quite appropriate. The nourishing and magical effects of Bovril beef extract have very clear evidence. In April last year, a pilot went missing while flying in the wilderness of New Jinshan. He was later found by a rescue plane, but he had been missing for several days and had not eaten for a long time. He was dying. When the rescuers saw this situation, they quickly gave him Bovril beef extract to drink, and he was able to turn danger into safety and celebrate his rebirth. Also, last autumn, Captain Torridore set off on an expedition by plane, and the rations he brought were Bovril beef extract. When he returned, he told everyone that the extract was magically effective and was not affected by any weather. It is an unparalleled treasure for patients and those with weak constitutions. From these few points, one can know that the popularity of Bovril beef extract around the world has its origins, it was said.</p>

<p>Book and Newspaper Introduction</p>
<h3>Folk Tales from Bengal by</h3>
<p>Lal Behari Day, Translated by Hsu Ti-shan</p>
<p>Published by Commercial Press</p>
<p>Hsu Ti-shan's fluent and smooth translation style has long been renowned in literary circles. I remember first encountering Hsu's translations in the supplements of the former Peking Morning Post and the Shanghai Short Story Monthly. What Hsu contributed to us in those two publications was considerable.</p>
<p>Now, Hsu's translation of Lal Behari Day's "Folk Tales of Bengal" has been presented to us in its entirety. As for the quality of his translation of these Bengali folk tales, there is no need for me to waste words here.</p>
<p>He translated this collection of Bengali folk tales from the 1912 Macmillan Company edition. According to his translator's preface, "I did not translate word for word, but rather expressed the meaning of each story directly. As for the wording of the original text, I have sometimes added or subtracted in the translation, because in translating folk tales, it is sufficient to clarify the content; there is no need to scrutinize each word as one would with other articles."</p>
<p>Indeed, in translating folk tales, it is only necessary to clarify the content. However, seeking to clarify the content is not an easy task. Some people like to use obscure and difficult writing styles and vocabulary in their translations to dazzle readers. But really, why bother? According to the translator's preface,</p>
<p>"My motivation for translating these twenty-two stories was twofold. First, I am very interested in the study of folklore, and I often feel that many Chinese folk tales have been indirectly imported from India. Translating more Indian stories will definitely be helpful for the study of Chinese folklore. Second, this spring, my daughter Chih-tzu asked me to read novels. I haven't written in a long time, and I couldn't write many stories in a short time, so I thought it would be better to spend two or three months translating a dozen or twenty stories for her to read, which would be more satisfying for her."</p>
<p>After reading the long passage above, we can see that he had two motivations for translating these Bengali folk tales. One of these motivations we can set aside. But the other motivation is quite capable of teaching us to admire his perseverance and spirit.</p>
<p>It is true that those who study folklore are not as likely to attract attention as those who study other subjects. However, little do people realize that folk tales and the like are the earliest endeavors of mankind in reasoning, memory, and imagination, and are of equal importance to other subjects. Moreover, folk tales are important research materials for folklore.</p>
<p>This book of Bengali folk tales contains twenty-two stories. Its list of contents is: (1) The Dead Bridegroom, (1) The Jewel Dragon, (1) The Three Treasure Jars, (1) The Rakshasa Kingdom, (1) The Strangler's Tears, (1) The Lucky Child, (1) The Seven Mothers and Children, (1) The Precious Fan, (1) Opium, (1) The Three Princes, (1) The Two Thieves, (1) The Ghost Husband, (1) The Beggar in the Wilderness, (1) The Ghost Wife, (1) The Ghost Friend, (1) Green Pearl, (1) The Ruby, (1) The Jackal Matchmaker, (1) The Crescent Moon Prince, (1) The Ghost Servant, (1) The Bone Plain, (1) The Bald Wife.</p>
<p>Of course, there are definitely more than just these twenty-two Bengali folk tales. In that case, even though these twenty-two stories are all Bengali folk tales, I am afraid that there will inevitably be omissions. As for this point, there is no need for me to explain it for him. According to the translator's preface,</p>
<p>"According to the author, these stories can very well represent the stories told by old village women in Bengal to their children."</p>
<p>Naturally, each of these twenty-two stories has its own unique characteristics. However, according to the translator's preface, "With the exception of 'The Two Thieves' and 'Opium,' most of the endings are happy and fulfilling."</p>
<p>Stories with happy and fulfilling endings are indeed easier to spread and persist than those that are not happy and fulfilling, because stories that are fulfilling and have happy endings are more likely to be welcomed by the public.</p>
<p>Finally, one more point is worth our attention: After an old woman in Bengal finishes telling a folk tale, she must recite a short, inexplicable song. Although there are only twenty-two stories in this collection of Lal Behari Day's Bengali folk tales, there are twenty-two instances of that kind of little song. The wording of that kind of little song is extremely peculiar. The translator says that this passage of meaningless words is intended to give the children listening a little interest. Here, let us transcribe the wording of that inexplicable song on the left:</p>
<p>My story is finished here,</p>
<p>The Natiye tree has withered.</p>
<p>Natiye tree, why have you withered?</p>
<p>Why does your cow want me to feed it grass?</p>
<p>Cow, why do you want someone to graze you?</p>
<p>Why doesn't your shepherd watch over me?</p>
<p>Shepherd, why don't you watch the cow?</p>
<p>Why doesn't your daughter-in-law give me rice?</p>
<p>Daughter-in-law, why don't you give rice?</p>
<p>Why is my child crying?</p>
<p>Child, why are you crying?</p>
<p>Why do the ants bite me?</p>
<p>Ants, why do you bite people?</p>
<p>Kaka, kaka, kaka.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between Automobiles and Gasoline KH</h3>
<p>Gasoline is the main element of the automotive industry. There is no doubt about it. The amount spent on its production and purchase far exceeds that of other items in mechanical vehicles by many times. If there were no gasoline, the entire world transportation would be immediately blocked. It is also a big question whether automobiles could have existed today without gasoline. I have thought about it. When Gotlibe Daimler Otto and his contemporaries created automobiles, if no gasoline was available, I don't know what path they would have taken to develop them. In that case, steam cars and some kind of electric cars would be running on the streets today. Judging from the fact that mechanics and science are constantly adapting to the needs of the times and are eager to make progress, these types of vehicles may not be able to achieve comfort, reliability, and speed.</p>
<p>Or a certain situation</p>
<p>But what I am paying attention to is, if the creators had no choice but to use fuels other than gasoline, what would be the ultimate evolution of the internal combustion engine, that is, the explosion engine? It should be known that the engine we are currently discussing relies on the combustion of fuel in the cylinder for its power. Its entire principle is an abstraction from the original large engine used in static applications, which was invented by the German Offo and used ordinary coal gas to drive it. Then, we have never been unable to obtain a vehicle that runs on a gas, with the gas subjected to a high compression force, stored in a strong steel box, sufficient to supply considerable power and speed? Or will there be talented people who invent an economical alcohol engine that is easy to start and has no other shortcomings, so that it will not be abandoned as it is today?</p>
<p>The advantages and disadvantages of gasoline</p>
<p>A pure mixture extracted from coal may have solved this problem. But whether enough coal can be mined to meet the needs of the United States alone, let alone the world, is also a big question. Even if it can, it is also a difficult task to make pure petrolene not dilute with the automobile, and to obtain cleanliness, ease of driving, and good acceleration, so that it will not be discarded as it is today.</p>
<p>Fortunately, gasoline has been abundant in the past, and is still enough for us to use today. There is no need to worry about a shortage, and there is no need to worry about a lack of suitable substitutes.</p>
<p>However, I still don't understand what kind of thoughts ordinary automobile users have about gasoline. Do they only see gasoline as gasoline? Or do they also observe the quality of its ingredients, and know that fuel is to the engine as straw is to a horse?</p>
<p>Before discussing the elements of good gasoline, I would like to reveal the internal workings of the engine's cylinder. I would like to ask what kind of action occurs in it, and how this action can combine forces and give us the most satisfactory result. The so-called most satisfactory result, based on the characteristics of current automobiles, can be summarized as ease of driving, smoothness, and rapid power.</p>
<p>How gasoline drives</p>
<p>The gasoline engine is a heat engine. Its action imitates the principle of the old-fashioned hot air engine commonly seen in children's toys. The air expands when heated. It is tightly closed and burned. The pressure of the expanding air can be used to push other objects. This is exactly the action of gasoline burning and exploding in the cylinder. A large amount of air, carrying a small amount of gasoline vapor, is introduced into the cylinder. At the appropriate time, electric sparks are generated to burn the oil gas. As a result, heat is generated and the air expands. As for</p>
<h3>The Persian King's Royal Car (See the previous issue of this publication for the story)</h3>
<h2>Page 29</h2>
<p>the appropriate degree, the piston is pushed, and the power stroke is performed. All of this seems very simple. It is very simple when all the necessary conditions are fulfilled and the parts move smoothly. But if the engine designer and the gasoline company cannot cooperate, the action will be uncoordinated.</p>
<p>Since we know that power relies on the expansion of air, and this expansion occurs in an extremely small space, and because the engine's volume and weight often impose very strict restrictions on the designer, the expansion can only extend to an extremely limited range. Therefore, when the piston descends, the mixture of air and gasoline must be added to the cylinder as much as possible. To obtain the highest degree of expansion, this mixture must be compressed as much as possible before combustion. Compression is carried out by the rising piston.</p>
<p>Some people think that every ounce of expansion force can be used to push the piston down. There is some truth to this. But in fact, it is not so. First, the engine's stroke, the length of which is sufficient to fully expand the mixed gas, the engine's volume has never been able to be so small as to be installed in an automobile. Second, the rear expansion often does not have sufficient original force to be used.</p>
<p>The most important reason why the rear original force is insufficient is the ease with which heat disappears. In fact, burning one gallon of gasoline can generate the heat of fifty-seven horsepower of power, while the current excellent engine can only generate power of about fourteen horsepower.

<p>Six wheels</p>
<h3>Feixia Public Bus Debuts</h3>
<p>Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>It took two years of research to complete</p>
<p>The 514 new car of the Feixia Automobile Factory has been released for a short time, and recently there has been a six-wheel, six-cylinder public bus. The excellent results are unprecedented. It was recently displayed at the Milan Italian branch for public exhibition. As far as the transportation industry in various parts of Italy is concerned, it is no different from other European countries. All bustling cities use public buses to travel instead of trams. Among them, Rome, the capital of Italy, is the most. Because in Rome, in bustling places, trams are not allowed to run except for public buses. In other central areas of Milan, Florence, and Naples, the same policy is adopted, but it is not as dictatorial as Rome. The new Feixia public bus is No. 640, which is manufactured in Italy. Since Feixia has a history, it is the first time that it has manufactured public buses in Italy. Moreover, this new car has a strong load-bearing capacity. It uses a double deck and can accommodate eighty-two people. There is only one type of chassis, and there are as many as three types of car bodies. Among them, the single-deck car body has a length of twenty-three feet six inches by seven feet six inches. The height is six feet ten inches. There are thirty seats, and the empty space can also accommodate thirty standing passengers. The driver and the ticket seller each have their own place. The double-deck car has an internal length of twenty-three feet five inches by seven feet five inches. The height is six feet three inches. The lower level can accommodate thirty-one seated passengers and twenty-three standing passengers. The upper level can accommodate twenty-eight people. A public bus that can accommodate eighty-two people is also the latest product, and it is unheard of by us.</p>
<p>The six-cylinder engine is installed in the front of the car body, below the driver's</p>
<p>room, and the driver sits on the left. Anyone who drives a car, once they test drive it, will know that the new car's parts are easy to control, as if there are no difficulties. The reason why the new car's performance is so excellent is that the engineering department spent two years of research during manufacturing before it was successfully completed. It was only this time that it was released to the world. If this kind of public bus is used in various parts of Italy, it will run on the road without any obstacles in any environment. Among the various advantages, the ease of arrangement, the reliability of the parts, and the agility of the action are the most noteworthy. This engine has six cylinders, and the circumference is 105 by 135MM in diameter and the stroke is 7014cc. All the cylinders are connected in one place and installed in one room. The head part is separated, and the piston is placed on one side. The crank rod has nine bearings. Even at the lowest speed, the engine can turn 2,200 revolutions, and the horsepower can reach 90 at the fastest. For reliability, double ignition is also used. Two spark plugs are installed on the cylinder, making a tilted shape. There is a horizontal handle in the front to control the water pump, and one end is connected to the magnet. On the cylinder board in the rear, there is a high surge force to distribute to each part, and it is input to the chassis through the transmission of the battery. On the left side of the engine, there is a removable water jacket to clean the cylinder. In order to avoid obstacles, the water distribution around the cylinder barrel is also quite uniform. The heat reduction device can also be separated at will, and the cold water system is equipped with a fan on the crank rod with two ropes attached, constantly working.</p>
<p>As far as the sliding action is concerned, under the control of pressure, four gallons of lubricating oil can be poured into each part, and the crankcase is like the track of the front axle, with an oil pump. One is to remove oil stains, and the other is to distribute the lubricating oil. Under the action of pressure, it is transmitted to the main and secondary connecting rod bearings, and there is a strong oil filter in the rear cylinder. All lubricating oil must pass through this filter. Exhaust and intake are on the right side of the engine, and the intake pipe is equipped with a heating point. A simple Sole Solex carburetor is connected to it, and fuel is input into the carburetor from a forty-four gallon oil tank. The power of electricity generation is extremely strong, and there are two electric motors on the engine, installed on the left and right sides of the gnawing. They work simultaneously on the gear ring and flywheel. Among the various accessories on the engine, the most noteworthy is the air pump, which is used to switch the doors of the car. It is completely driven by air, and it can also make the tires expand. The stored fuel causes the engine to move and affect the car frame. It is extremely convenient and separated from the gear box, but it is connected to the gnawing sub-chamber. The engine is connected in three points. There are two rotating machines, that is, behind the crankcase. After separating from the gear box, or when each part is not connected, it can be rotated. In the engine, on the cylinder, there are countless huge key belts. One of the front ones can make the engine move forward and hook each other, and the front pulley is connected to the back to be separated from the chassis. It is said that it is possible to change an engine in two hours. Its speed is really unparalleled.</p>
<p>The skeleton of the chassis is quite high, divided into three lanes, spanning each part, and four large-diameter tubes. The most important one is in the rear axle. The four-part speed gearbox is installed on the sub-frame, and is completely separated from the engine. There is a short rod behind the gearbox, with two connecting points, and one end is the wheel brake drum. Pushing the propulsion rod here can establish a relationship with the rear axle through the universal joint. The wheels have different axles, and so does the rear axle. The flexibility of action is undoubtedly excellent. The springs installed on the front are elliptical, and there are two pairs of semi-elliptical ones in the rear. Internal wheel braking is convenient because the foot pedal is easy to operate. When the speed is slow and loaded with cargo, when driving 22 miles per hour, manual wheel braking can be used. The tires used are Dunlop 38 by 9. The wheels are completely made of steel. In terms of speed, the fastest is also divided into two levels: one is 28 miles per hour, and the other is 24 and a quarter miles per hour. The car bodies are also made of metal to suit the use in Italy, which is the main problem. There are two entrances in the middle, and there are also two similar entrances in the front. The opening and closing of the door is completely driven by air, so passengers cannot get on and off when the public bus is running.</p>
<h3>A Comparison of American Automobiles in the Past Two Years of Greatness</h3>
<p>The United States of America is the richest country in the world. The production of automobiles is so large and the demand is so wide that it is like our cloth and beans. It is inexhaustible. It is a daily necessity that people cannot leave for a moment. The trend of its production and sales increases with each year. Comparing the situation last year with the previous year can be convincing. According to the statistics of Li Fushi, president of the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce of the United States, in 1929, the national production of various automobiles reached 5,651,000 vehicles, with a total sales price of 3,483,900,000 yuan. In 1928, the production volume was 4,601,130 vehicles, with a sales price of 3,162,798,880 yuan. The production volume increased by about 23 percent.</p>
<p>The number of automobile registrations worldwide reached 34,700,000 vehicles by the end of 1929.

<h3>Packard Sets New Record Again Qu Zi</h3>
<p>A large tire factory in Akron, Ohio, USA, recently reported that its Packard eight-cylinder car has set a new record. It is said that since the factory purchased Packard as a tire test car, in eight months, excluding Sundays and holidays, Packard has continued to drive for 194 days, traveling a total of</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>148,400 miles. The average daily trip is 764.9 miles.</p>
<p>This tire test car has to travel 24 hours a day, driven by three drivers, taking turns every eight hours. Sandbags are piled on the car, and its load is more than that of seven passengers. The perilousness of the roads traveled is also one of the essential conditions.</p>
<p>After this new record performance, the Packard Akron Automobile Company immediately came out to inspect it. It was found that the engine was in good condition and there was no need for repair. Everyone was amazed. According to statistics, the average person's car travels about 10,000 miles per year. But Packard's eight-month trip has exceeded the average car's fourteen-year trip. How sturdy is its machine?</p>
<h3>Pin High Price Low De Sha Duo Qu Zi</h3>
<p>It is not surprising that manufacturers can make low-priced cars. To gain the trust of customers, it is even more important to pay attention to quality at the same time. For example, ease of starting, stable operation, and various characteristics recognized by both drivers and passengers are all issues that automobile manufacturers should pay attention to.</p>
<p>What society expects from automobile manufacturers is: First, the price is clever. Second, the quality is good. Therefore, manufacturers only show the world low-priced cars, which is only half of meeting the needs. It must also be that the price is reduced and the quality is not damaged. In other words, this car must use quality as the standard. You must not reduce the price and degrade the products.</p>
<p>The De Sha Duo straight-line eight-cylinder car is known to everyone as the world's lowest-priced eight-cylinder car. At the same time, it has also proven to be the most exquisite automobile on the automobile market. For example, the under-injection carburetion system was adopted the earliest. Its engineering principle is to use gravity to send gas into the cylinder, so it is greatly improved in terms of changing wheel age and acceleration. As for the construction of its chassis and body, it is made of a whole piece of steel plate, which is unparalleled in firmness, and it is rare for other cars to drive quietly.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Construction Department</h3>
<p>Unfulfilled First Phase of Highway Budget</p>
<p>From the 18th year of the Republic of China to the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction. The first phase of various construction plans and budgets. From the 18th year of the Republic of China to the 22nd year of the Republic of China. Classified implementation. Extremely thorough. Among them, regarding highway matters. It is said that by the sixth month of the 18th year, the highways managed by Zhejiang Province that were open to traffic were only the Hangzhou-Shaoxing, Jie-Feng, and Hangzhou-Changshan roads. Less than 270 kilometers. However, according to the current plan, adding the Hangzhou-Pinghu and Hangzhou-Changhua roads in the second half of the 18th year, the mileage open to traffic can be increased to 600 kilometers by the 19th year. The 19th year is a period of rapid progress in road administration engineering. It is estimated that the mileage open to traffic can be increased to 1,100 kilometers by the 20th year. However, at this time, the number of vehicles urgently needs to be increased, and the road surface should also be improved. Therefore, the expenses in the 20th year cannot be mostly used to develop routes. From the 21st year onwards, actively construct year by year. By the end of the 22nd year, the total mileage of highways in the province can reach more than 1,300 kilometers. The projects on each road are planned to be carried out in stages due to limited funding. The annual expenditure on engineering costs is approximately two million two hundred thousand silver dollars. As for road surface paving, for roads with very dense transportation demand, secondary materials can be used in the first year. Once business develops and the number of vehicles increases, high-quality gravel road surfaces can be gradually adopted. Therefore, the road surface engineering costs are included in the next year's budget. As the routes gradually lengthen and business gradually develops, revenue will also increase accordingly. The estimated operating revenue for the 10th year is 837,000 yuan. It can be increased to 4,824,000 yuan by the 22nd year. However, there should be sufficient vehicles to meet the needs of operation from the beginning. At the beginning of the 18th year, there were approximately 95 passenger vehicles. It is estimated that one hundred and several tens of vehicles will be added each year. By the 22nd year, the total number of vehicles should be at least 600. However, assuming that each vehicle can only be used for four years, the vehicles added in the 18th year will need to be scrapped and repurchased by the 22nd year. In reality, in addition to purchasing vehicles due to business development, it is also necessary to purchase replacement vehicles to compensate for the scrapped old vehicles. Therefore, the expenses are even greater. To make it easier to organize, the depreciation method is used, deducting a certain percentage from the annual operating surplus. Savings are used to generate interest, specifically for purchasing new vehicles. In addition, there are also automobile repairs, bridge replacements, bridge repairs, route improvements, station equipment improvements, and year-end bonuses for mechanical workers, etc. Therefore, a certain percentage should be reserved from the operating surplus, so that funds are available and the business can gradually develop. Regarding land acquisition, if an average of 25 mu per kilometer is calculated, then by the end of the 22nd year, a total of 37,000 mu will be acquired. At an average of 50 yuan per mu, the total land price owed is more than 1.8 million yuan. In the future, 300 kilometers of roads will be built each year, requiring the purchase of 5,000 mu of land, totaling 250,000 yuan in land price. If 8 percent is deducted from the annual operating surplus and reserved for land price repayment, and 2.5 million yuan in interest-free treasury bills for highway land use are issued, then all debts can be repaid within seven and a half years. To facilitate the calculation of operating surplus, it is assumed that after various allocations are made: (A) Revenue: 100.00 percent. (B) Expenditures: 1. Operating expenses average 65.00 percent. 2. Automobile repairs and depreciation: 6.00 percent. 3. Engineering repairs and improvements: 4.00 percent. 4. Employee bonuses: 2.00 percent. 5. Land price repayment: 8.00 percent. (C) Surplus: Net operating surplus: 15.00 percent. Based on the percentage calculated in this method, to allocate the annual operating revenue, then the annual net operating surplus can be used for highway construction. The net surplus in the 18th year is only 120,000 yuan. It is estimated that it can be increased to 730,000 yuan by the 22nd year. The enterprise funds taken from the provincial treasury can also be reduced year by year. This is a rough estimate of the budget for the five-year period.</p>

<h3>World Automobile News A</h3>
<p>The Rapid Progress of Road Construction in China: According to recent statistics, China's automobile roads have exceeded 30,000 miles, with another 4,000 miles under construction. The provinces with the most roads are Guangdong and Henan. The new roads in Zhejiang are also increasing daily, as is the case in Jiangsu. In 1931, Fujian Province had only three automobiles. Now, there are more than 300 long-distance buses. The roads are all new, such as the impressive highway from Fuzhou to Xiamen. Nationally, the road movement in other inland areas is flourishing.</p>
<p>The Automobile Speedway in Spain: From the capital of Spain to a seaport, the road is 260 miles long. It is specifically for automobile speeding and racing. Road construction has now begun. The road is 36 feet wide, with 6 feet of roadside on each side for parking. The road is wider at the bends. At intersections with other roads, the road surface is raised or a tunnel is opened to avoid collisions and obstructions. In addition, there is already a fast road to the French border, with good results.</p>
<p>General Motors' Service: General Motors' service covers the globe. At the ends of the earth, there is nowhere it is not. As far as the deep mountains of Norway, a Chevrolet car suddenly had a slippage damaged halfway. A General Motors manager was reported using a long-distance telephone, about 100 miles away. The local population is only 3,000. However, there is also a Chevrolet manager. The manager received a telephone call and dispatched a mechanic and assistant to set off the next day. The slippage was replaced and the car lining was re-fabricated. After working for four hours, the car was restored and drove as usual.</p>
<p>Automobiles in Hungary: Central European Hungary has greatly improved its road administration after the European War. There are already more than 18,000 automobiles, and an Automobile Association has been established, initiated by the royal family. The Hungarian Ministry of the Interior has issued a special order that all chauffeurs have the obligation to stop and provide assistance if they encounter an accident on the road.</p>
<p>France Bans Automobile Year Impersonation: The Paris Court has recently established a ban. The year of manufacture of automobiles must not be impersonated. For example, if this year is 1930, a new car owner must not change it to 1931 when selling it next year. Violators will be punished for the crime of deceiving people.</p>
<p>General Motors' Output: Speed: In 1909, a car factory could produce 400 cars in one month, which was considered very rare. The situation is different today. Taking General Motors as an example, the output of the Walkerville, Ontario plant is at least 400 cars every two hours.</p>
<h3>Interesting Anecdotes of Automobiles Penetrating Savage Lands by Xu Meilie</h3>
<p>People with a little common sense know that automobiles are the only effective means of land transportation in modern times. However, they do not know that in addition to the functions of carrying heavy loads over long distances and being fast and durable, they also have the functions of overcoming enemies, overcoming dangers, and defending against insults. This is not an exaggeration. The new achievements of Studebaker cars in Africa recently are sufficient to prove this. The matter is also very interesting. The American mining engineering team working on the south bank of the Lengbo River is now ordered to investigate the new Kimberly diamond mining area. They take a car deep into the hinterland of the Baike-ti Kingdom. This area is the breeding area of savage people in Central Africa. It is purely outside civilization. It is unusually dangerous. Before the team members arrived there, they knew that the savage people were like fierce beasts and loved to kill people. They wanted to find a native as a guide, but they could not. They were worried that they would end up in the bellies of the savage people. However, due to the importance of their work, they knew that dangers were ahead, so they had to set out resolutely, regardless of other considerations. This shows the spirit of American bravery and adventure. The car used was an old Studebaker car. It had already traveled 30,000 miles. Going from the Lengbo River, there was no road to pass. The coast was full of dense forests and jungles. Human traces were rare. Or high mountains and steep ridges were rugged and difficult to climb. After driving all day, after passing fifty miles, they began to feel that there were gradually paths to follow. The next day, they arrived in the Baike-ti Kingdom. A group of people were careful and cautious, carefully advancing. To prevent savage people from invading. Because the savagery and cruelty of the savage people here does not have a shred of human nature. Often, when encountering outsiders, they are slaughtered. Few are allowed to return alive. In a state of confusion, many savage people appeared. Just as they were trying to find a way to avoid them. Unexpectedly, when these people saw this self-propelled car, they were shocked to find a rare monster. The characteristics that were usually brave in responding to the enemy, suddenly changed to an attitude of fear and docility. Their meaning probably did not know what the comers were. What kind of people were they? They all suspected that it must be a god descending to drive this fierce and invincible monster to hunt them. Therefore, they quietly lurked in the jungle. They were shocked and did not dare to move. After about a while, they saw that the comers had no malice. Then they dared to hesitate and advance slowly. They surrounded the car to find out what was going on. Then they saw that the riders were holding self-defense weapons in one hand, and injecting water into the radiator and adding gasoline to the fuel tank. They were even more surprised. An old man approached the car and tried it with his hand. Suddenly his finger touched the car horn. The sound was like a beast roaring. They were scared and took a few steps back. Their appearance was laughable. Therefore, the lords of the savage people thought that this strange thing contained mysterious and incredible wonders. They did not dare to underestimate it even more. They only had a heart of awe. They did not dare to think about invading. American engineers, etc. were safe to encounter this. So they were able to calmly proceed. The investigation of the diamond mine was successful. The savage nature of the savage people loves to kill. Often, blood-shedding tragedies are staged. Now, without spending an arrow, only a car was used. Within an hour, their wild nature was overcome. Turning fierceness into docility. How can it not be a very strange thing. If the engineering team had not brought this thing at that time, then not only the purpose of exploring mines would be difficult to achieve, but also their lives would probably not be saved. This car is not only enough to provide a substitute for walking, but also can protect life. Its usefulness is really great.</p>

<h3>The Sufficiency of Buick Parts</h3>
<p>For automobile service to be satisfactory, the supply and convenience of parts should be given the most attention. Buick has set up a special factory to manufacture large quantities of parts, which are shipped to various places to supply customers, to ensure that the service is complete and the results are outstanding. The oldest Buick (manufactured 26 years ago) is still running on the road. The parts are matched. All kinds are available. The goods prepared on weekdays, which can be shipped immediately, are no less than 20,000 kinds. In the parts factory, all the old-fashioned Buick parts manufacturing machines are still preserved. Recently, an American farmer bought a Buick in 1904. Although the car body was damaged, the engine could still be used. It was modified to be used as a saw spring. One day, the cylinder crank cover was suddenly damaged, and he wrote to the Buick factory to order it. The factory had machinery ready-made, so it was immediately processed. The thoroughness of the service can be seen from this. The machine parts of Buick cars and Marquette cars, as well as the finned wheels, footboards, etc., are all in stock, and can be replaced immediately at various branch offices.</p>
