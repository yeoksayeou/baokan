<p>自膠錫價格慘跌失業恐慌　漫南島馬來亞總督金文泰自八月一日起宣佈限制華工入口三個月在八九十三個月内每月僅准華僑五千人至新嘉坡登岸并將額數分配與各輪船公司運載若有逾額則責令原輸運回中國照馬來亞海峡殖民地政府定例凡總督頒佈法令須得立法會議認可限制華工進口條例苟非得立法會議通過僅能實施一個月（此爲總督特權）今八月二十五立法會議已將此案通過則限制華工條例已可實施三個月無疑至滿期時是否延期尚難逆料惟此條例并未限制婦女進口其原因乃在［進口華人之兩性比率可藉此稍改善其不均之象］觀此則今後華工之來馬來亞者已减去三分之二矣（據馬來亞七州府所统計本年七月份入口華僑共一萬七千三百八十三人自限制華工消息傳至祖國厦門汕頭南來客票聞由十餘元增至四十元汕頭又有增至四十八元者且有客多無票互争購買可知影響閩粤民生之大也</p>
<p>在此馬來亞限制華工入口聲中暹羅政府亦公佈移民法令限制外人入境查暹羅所公佈移民法令計共十條（已見前報）暹羅與我國並未互派公使前此我國僑胞入暹者每人須納身字費十五銤約合國幣二十元此次暹羅頒佈移民法令係由日本駐暹公使繙譯後轉送我國故今後華僑能否依照其條例辦法入境是所望於我國政府外交部籌議善法以解僑胞之疑慮焉</p>
<p>荷屬東印度殖民地政府因明年進支預算入寡出多乃决議增加税收以資彌補其與華僑最有關係者即自一九三一年起每人進口税（碼頭捐）由一百盾增至一百五十盾商業印花税比舊例增多二倍自前月分佈後棉蘭巴城各地總商會不論華人巫人印人均上書請减對印花或得减輕而對碼頭捐則不能减少最可異者契约華工進境（即我國所謂猪仔）亦須納碼頭捐一半計七十五盾契約華工本爲私販人口數年前最盛行於閩粤兩省現已稍殺依照舊例契約華工入荷屬不納碼頭捐迨契約期滿（在契約期内有作工無工資）但納一盾半印花即可得居留字得在荷屬自由居住近頒佈新例契約滿期之華工須納七十五盾登陸税始准居留契約華工納税增加如此之鉅荷印國民會議時曾引起重大争辯惟無具體辦法故增加碼頭捐一事勢在必行蓋已列入明年進欵預算表也然則華工之進荷屬者若爲自由入境自明年起應納碼頭捐一百五十盾若爲契約華工則應納七十五盾碼頭捐實爲勢所必然也</p>

<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>笑聲最高的人常常不是最快樂的人</p>
<p>要閉嘴先要有一個公開的心</p>
<p>男子在女人的手中好像是一把泥土能夠使它圓也能夠使它扁</p>
<p>惡習慣同海藻一樣假使你不能除去它的根它就會一天多似一天</p>
<p>不能相信自己的人决不能相信别人</p>
<p>一個已結婚的女子决不能告訴你伊的丈夫在求婚時説的是什麽話因爲伊旣得了勝利早把從前的事忘了</p>
<p>從前的少女費了伊所有的精力想使男子傾向於結婚可是現代的少子却在施用伊的魔力想把男子們從婚姻之中拖將出來</p>
<p>愛情和結婚純粹是兩種不同的東西無論男女一有了這兩種東西的經騐時他或伊决不能得到任何利益</p>
<p>人對人只是一個悶葫蘆假使你能看穿了所謂大人物者的心腸時你就會把他殺死</p>
<p>快樂的事决不能延長延長了的快樂就是世界上最苦惱的事</p>
<p>世界上决没有［失去了的愛情］這種東西因爲眞正的愛情是决不會失去的失去了的愛情决不是眞正的愛情</p>
<p>給你打而不還手的人最要當心因爲他旣不肯饒你也不答應你自己饒了自己</p>

<h3 id="e11">Resolution of the Saar Problem <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>To Achieve World Peace, the Spirit of Competition Must First Be Eliminated; To Eliminate the Spirit of Competition, All Previous Grievances and Unequal Circumstances Must First Be Eliminated, So That Friendship Between Nations Increases Daily and There Is No Suspicion or Unease; Then International Competition Will Naturally Not Arise. This Is Obvious. After the European War, There Are Many Grievances and Unequal Circumstances Left Behind. Although the League of Nations Has Done Its Best to Maintain and Mediate, Many Cases Are Still Pending, and Opinions Have Not Been Resolved. Since Germany's Submission to the Treaty of Versailles, Its Feelings of Resentment and Injustice Have Been Expressed From Time to Time. Some Say That It Is Enough to Cause World Unrest Again. Later, the Locarno Treaty Was Established, and Germany's Status Was Promoted to Equal Status With All Countries. The German People's Resentment Was Slightly Reduced. However, Germany's Hopes of Restoring Its Borders and Withdrawing Allied Troops Have Not Been Fulfilled. Knowing That It Must Rely on the League of Nations, It Then Moved to Join the League of Nations. After Joining, the German People Made Many Efforts. Recently, the French Troops Stationed in the Rhineland Have Been Withdrawn, and the Allied Troops Protecting the Railway in the Saar Region Have Also Been Ordered by the League of Nations Administrative Council to Be Withdrawn Within Three Months. Although in Name There Are Still Clauses Such as Reoccupation If Disturbances Occur, the German People May Not Be Completely Satisfied. However, After Being Managed and Operated by the German People, Unexpected Disturbances Should Not Occur. Then the So-Called Troop Stationing Problem Has Been Finally Resolved, and One of the So-Called Grievances and Unequal Circumstances Between Nations Can Be Reduced, Which Is One Less Root of International Disputes. The European Political Situation May Be Slightly More Stable as a Result. This Is Probably One of the Achievements of the League of Nations.</p>

<p>League of Nations Council Seat</p>
<p>Our Country's Long-Held Hope</p>
<p>Withdrawal of Saar Defense Forces</p>
<p>German Demand for Victory</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 13th: The election of non-permanent council members to the League of Nations Administrative Council is scheduled to be held on September 16th.</p>
<p>Pacific News Agency, Geneva, 13th: It is not yet known whether the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations Administrative Council election will announce its candidacy or not. The reason is that it has not been three years since China withdrew from the Administrative Council. It must wait one year before it can be a candidate. At this time, if it wants to advance the election, it must request the League of Nations General Assembly to vote for special permission for consecutive re-election. The General Assembly is unwilling to do this kind of exceptional preferential treatment. Even the Latin American and European small countries are increasingly opposed to the principle of consecutive re-election. It is difficult for China to obtain a two-thirds majority in this situation. It will be greatly hoped that it can be elected next year with only a simple majority. The British and French delegations have indicated to the Chinese delegation that they are willing to help with all their voting rights.</p>
<p>Geneva News: The League of Nations' election of council members to the Administrative Council has attracted much attention from all parties, and Dr. Wu Chaoshu, the Chinese representative, has made a special trip from the United States to promote and strive for a seat for the Republic of China, which has greatly increased the enthusiasm of the countries hoping to be candidates. According to the term expiring this year, the three non-permanent council members are Cuba, Finland, and Canada. The seat of Cuba will naturally be succeeded by a Central American or South American country. The seat of Finland will also be occupied by Norway, and the most promising candidate for the seat of Canada is Ireland. Therefore, China and Ireland will have fierce competition to seek this seat. According to Geneva observers, the League of Nations has been very concerned about China recently, such as the previous Ministry of Health's visit to China to seek cooperation with the Chinese authorities to improve the national health system, and the League of Nations is currently planning to reorganize China's economic strategy to implement it when the opportunity arises. These are all proofs of its desire to contact China. Moreover, China currently owes the League of Nations hundreds of millions of yuan in membership fees. If China withdraws due to being defeated, this huge amount will be uncollectible. Therefore, many parties are willing to see China re-enter the Administrative Council. (World)</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 12th: The League of Nations Administrative Council today passed a resolution advocating that the French troops protecting the railway in the Saar region be withdrawn within three months. In the future, in name, the Allied Powers still have the right to send troops to occupy the Saar region if disturbances occur, but the provisions are very broad, and British Foreign Secretary Henderson also made a declaration yesterday opposing the reoccupation of the withdrawn areas in the future. Therefore, this right is only equivalent to a formality. In the event that the use of force is necessary in the future, it is likely that German police will be dispatched from the Rhineland. Therefore, German Foreign Minister Koudtiz expressed to the press that he was extremely satisfied with the resolution of the Administrative Council.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th: The Geneva League of Nations Administrative Council today passed an agreement reached by the French and German foreign ministers in private talks that the last batch of French troops would withdraw from German territory within three months. The Administrative Council discussed the issue of protecting the freedom of railway transportation in the Saar region and decided to abolish the troops protecting the railway and the railway commission. The withdrawal of the protection forces is scheduled to be implemented within three months.</p>

<p>Pacific News Agency, Geneva, 13th: Although the Haitian representative spoke in a personal capacity, his speech left a very enthusiastic impression. This is the first time that the North American Union's continental policy has been brought to the League of Nations General Assembly for discussion. The main points of the representative's speech were mentioned earlier when the Latin American representatives discussed the country's application for a seat on the League of Nations Administrative Council. Recently, they have asked the League of Nations General Assembly to resist the United States, saying that its overbearing attitude is becoming increasingly terrifying and that the countries of the West Indies and Central America have the same feeling. The representative's words attracted the attention of the audience. Representatives from South American countries believe that their interests are greatly threatened, and it is very satisfying to hear this speech.</p>

<p>Geneva, Reuters, 13th – At today's League of Nations meeting, British Trade Minister Graham announced that Britain will approve the Tariff Truce Pact on November 1st of this year. The pact stipulates that existing commercial agreements will continue for one year, during which no new barriers should be erected unless absolutely necessary. If new tariffs are imposed, negotiations should precede their implementation. Graham hopes that concrete proposals can be considered in the autumn or, at the latest, next spring, to achieve the aim of tax reduction. These negotiations should begin as soon as possible, as all countries are eager to achieve tangible results in tax reduction and avoid restrictions. Graham also urged all countries to approve the pact by November 1st, after which the signatory states will convene to determine whether the number of ratifications is sufficient to bring the pact into effect. He expressed concern that a limited number of ratifications would prevent the pact from being implemented, which would be regrettable.</p>

<p>Expected to Be Higher Than in Previous Years</p>
<p>Twenty-Four Parties Compete Fiercely</p>
<p>Berlin, National Society, 12th – With only one day left until the general election, the old parties are intensifying their efforts to guide forty million voters. The total number of candidates has reached 7,111, including 637 women. Although the election campaign has been very intense, with only occasional clashes between the extreme left and right wings, order has generally been maintained, and no excessive behavior has been observed. The number of attendees at speeches by candidates of various parties is also higher than in previous years, indicating the public's attention to the election. It is expected that the number of votes cast this time will be higher than in previous years. Among the old parties participating in the election campaign, only about twelve are expected to secure a sufficient number of votes. These include the Social Democratic Party, the National Party, the Nationalist Party, the Economic Party, and the three parties split from the old National Rights Party. The Communist Party and the National Socialist Party, known for their anti-revolutionary stance, and the Bavarian Nationalist Party, which holds significant power in Bavaria, are also participating. Voting will take place on Sunday from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. All German men and women over the age of twenty have the right to vote. Although the parties supporting the current government are competing independently, they share a common voice, urging the people to safeguard national rights, strive to eliminate anti-revolutionary tendencies, and hoping that the ten million middle-class voters who abstained from voting in the last election will rise up and support them. The Social Democratic Party is also calling on the public as the guarantor of the republic. The National Socialist Party is advocating for the overthrow of the current government system and the establishment of the Third Germany, with the aim of establishing a strong, authoritarian government. Conversely, the Communist Party, in addition to reforming the economic system and the social system, is also appealing to the public by denying the Treaty of Versailles and the Young Plan.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Japan-US Naval Treaty Situation Still Chaotic After Detailed Examination <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Substantive Deliberations Completed</p>
<p>But Resolution Still Requires Significant Twists</p>
<p>Tokyo, Dentsu, 13th – The tenth session of the Privy Council's detailed review committee was held at 1:00 PM yesterday. Initially, General Kawai questioned the content of the response presented by the military councilor. Naval Minister Takaarabe replied, "When I attended the councilor meeting as a military councilor, I stated that [while the naval strength under the treaty is not sufficient for national defense, the treaty is a short-term agreement, and there are ways to supplement it]." The attendees generally held the same view. General Kawai asked whether this view could be interpreted as the content of the response. Naval Minister Takaarabe replied that interpretation was free. General Kawai attempted to pursue the matter further, but Committee Chairman Ito raised his hand to stop him, stating that this question could be answered in its entirety and did not need to be pursued further. General Kawai then shifted his focus to the issue of whether former minister Kato had agreed, and questions were asked to the Prime Minister, Yamanouchi, regarding the future of Japan-US relations and to Foreign Minister Shidehara. Afterwards, Kaneko Kenki stated that disregarding national defense issues would have a negative impact on the national spirit and hoped for future attention. Kugota male rose and said that the United States has extremely deep ambitions in the East, so attention must be paid to concrete alternatives for replenishment. At this point, Committee Chairman Ito rose and stated that the inquiries to the government had largely been completed. Areas that the government could not explain had already been impossible. He requested another meeting on the 15th and adjourned at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Dentsu, 13th – The tenth session of the Privy Council's detailed review committee dispersed without a head-on collision due to Chairman Ito's skillful mediation. However, the Privy Council and the government's interpretations are inconsistent, and the situation cannot be determined hastily. The true attitude of the Privy Council will be decided after the 15th. According to optimistic interpretations from the government side, if the Privy Council intends to reject the treaty proposal, then Committee Member Kaneko should not have lectured on American diplomatic policy, and Committee Member Kugota should not have mentioned the relationship between national ideology and national defense. In particular, when Committee Member Kawai pursued the response issue, Chairman Ito stated that the matter had largely been clarified and did not need to be pursued further, implying that he wanted the review to conclude uneventfully. It is heard that some committee members advocated for passing the treaty with a warning, which further indicates that there must be a shift in the committee's atmosphere towards the government. However, according to news from the Privy Council side, the government's statement that Chairman Ito's words could end the matter meant that the questioning was suspended prematurely. The Privy Council could not help but suspend substantive deliberations because the review materials it requested were not presented. The result was that there were only imaginative statements regarding military strength and command authority. It strongly denied the establishment of a compromise, stating that significant twists are still needed to resolve the treaty proposal.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Dentsu, 13th – The situation of the Privy Council committee is still chaotic. Both the tough stance on the Privy Council side and the government side's talk of improved circumstances are not real. According to the Privy Council's customary practice, formal committee meetings usually adopt a unanimous attitude. Therefore, in this treaty proposal, whether or not a decisive vote will be held, significant debates will still take place within the Privy Council to achieve unanimity.</p>

<p>Your newspaper's Important News column on the 9th reported a news item about the escape of Communist bandits from Hukou, stating that the Communist army occupied Hukou on the 5th. Upon investigation, the Communist army that invaded Hukou County on the 4th only reached Jiangqiao, twenty miles outside the city, before being fiercely repelled by our troops. Hukou has always been defended by our army. The news item is inaccurate. Please correct it. [Seal of the Anti-Smuggling Command]</p>

<h3 id="e60">Promotion of Hunan Generals for Suppressing Bandits <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The sacrifices in Hunan Province in the current suppression of bandits have been greater than before. Dai Douyuan, Deputy Division Commander and Commander of the 47th Brigade of the 16th Division; Tian Yingtang, Commander of the 93rd Regiment; and Wan Fangzhi, Commander of the 2nd Regiment of the 1st Brigade of the 31st Division, all died in battle. Chen Guangzhong, Commander of the 7th Independent Brigade; and Chen Wo, Commander of the 2nd Brigade of the 31st Division, were all reprimanded. The number of soldiers killed, wounded, and missing exceeded 2,000. As a result, Changsha, the provincial capital, was preserved, preventing the spread of bandit forces. When He Yingqin came to Hunan the other day, he summoned all the generals who had suppressed bandits to express his condolences and asked He Jian to promote and report the meritorious generals in this bandit suppression to the Commander-in-Chief for appointment in order to encourage them. On the verge of leaving, he explained that the Communist Party had been ordered by the Third International to attempt to seize the central commercial port of the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi in order to disrupt the Yangtze River as a base. Their goal was not limited to a corner of Hunan Province. The preservation of Changsha was sufficient to curb their ambitions, consolidate the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and relieve the Party-State's worries about the south. He hoped that all levels of officers would embrace a spirit of great fearlessness, not be afraid of sacrifice, and strive for the foundation of the Party-State. The complete extermination of the Red bandits and the completion of great achievements would be the most glorious achievements for the Hunan military. All units that sacrificed in the suppression of bandits would be supplemented by one level according to the central regulations. For example, if a certain company sacrificed, the company would be replenished and promoted to a battalion. If a battalion sacrificed, it would be replenished and promoted to a regiment. If a regiment was replenished, it would be promoted to a brigade. If a brigade was replenished, it would be promoted to a division. A division could also be replenished and promoted to an army, and so on. After being encouraged by this, all the generals were united in their hatred of the enemy, and their morale was very high. However, because the fortification work near the provincial capital had not been fully completed, a large part of the troops could not be transferred to attack. The large army dispatched by the central government would not arrive in Jiangxi for a considerable period of time, and the friendly forces had not yet reached their designated locations. Therefore, for the time being, they would only firmly defend the fortresses to ensure safety, and judiciously dispatch troops to guard outside the positions. Who knew that the bandits such as Zhu Mao Huang Wu, etc., seeing that our army had not dispatched a large number of troops, took advantage of the heavy rain and wind on the night of the 10th and once again launched a fierce attack on the right-wing positions of Yuhuating, Amiling, and Southeast Du from the three directions of Dongshan Tiaoma Stream. After Liu Jianxu and Gong Bingfan's troops calmly responded to the attack, machine gunners, grenade squads, and broadsword teams were sent to meet them head-on. After holding out until 11:00 AM on the 11th, four aircraft from the air force dropped heavy bombs and bombed them, killing more than a thousand bandits and capturing hundreds. The bandits then collapsed in several directions towards the Dongshan Tiaoma Stream Tianxin Bridge area. Our army also pursued them out of the fortress to the Tianjiling Guitang Tongjingpu area, a distance of twenty miles, to guard. It is heard that the bandits are currently building fortifications in Dongshan Tiaoma Stream Yong'an Temple and other places to confront our army. However, the two groups of Peng Dehuai and Kong Hechong are retreating towards the Pingjiang Jinjing Gaoqiao area. Luo Lin's division is advancing in that direction to prevent Peng Bandit from having other plans. After this battle, it is expected that the bandits will not dare to try again lightly. As for the meritorious officers of all levels who should be promoted and rewarded in this bandit suppression, He Jian has already telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Jiang to request that a clear order be issued and the division be investigated as follows: (1) Wei Suzhong, Commander of the 15th Division, is transferred to the position of Senior Staff Officer of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Headquarters. Wang Dongyuan, Commander of the 43rd Brigade of the division, is promoted to Commander of the 15th Division. Yang Zhenpu, Commander of the regiment, is promoted to Commander of the 43rd Brigade. (2) Luo Fanying, Commander of the 16th Division, is transferred to the position of Senior Staff Officer of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Headquarters. Peng Weiren, Commander of the 46th Brigade of the division, is promoted to Commander of the 16th Division. Liu Jiren, Commander of the Regiment, is promoted to Commander of the 46th Brigade. Liu Yijing, Commander of the Regiment, is promoted to Commander of the 47th Brigade. Zhang Liangji is promoted to Commander of the 48th Brigade. (3) Liu Jianxu, Commander of the 19th Division, is promoted to Army Commander. Li Jue, Commander of the 57th Brigade of the division, is promoted to Commander of the 19th Division. Tao Liu, Commander of the Regiment, is promoted to Commander of the 57th Brigade. Deng Nanji, Commander of the Regiment, is promoted to Commander of the 56th Brigade. (4) Chen Guangzhong, Commander of the 7th Independent Brigade, is promoted to Division Commander. Wang Dezhang, He Yunqing, and Li Ang, Commanders of the Regiment, are promoted to Brigade Commanders. The number of Liu Jianxu's army and Chen Guangzhong's division will be determined after Commander-in-Chief Jiang promulgates them. As for the vacancies of regimental and battalion commanders, the army division commanders will select meritorious company commanders and forward them to the central government for appointment.

<h3 id="e61">Nanchang Municipal Government Reorganized According to New Municipal Law <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Jiujiang Municipal Government Also Abolished</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: According to the new municipal organization law promulgated by the National Government, municipal governments cannot be established in cities with a population of less than 230,000 and a total tax revenue of less than one-third of the city's total. Therefore, the Jiujiang municipal government has been abolished in accordance with the regulations. According to recent investigations, the population of Nanchang is over 230,000. In terms of tax revenue, according to the new law, the estimated annual land tax revenue is 210,000 yuan, the license tax is over 12,000 yuan, and the business tax is over 42,800 yuan. In addition, various other revenues total approximately 249,300 yuan per year, which accounts for more than one-half of the city's total revenue. Therefore, Mayor Xi Shizeng specifically reported the above situation to the higher authorities, and the municipal government was approved to continue to exist. However, due to the rampant bandits and communists in the province, the financial difficulties have reached their peak. The provincial government's subsidies and operating expenses to the municipal government are in arrears of approximately 400,000 yuan as of June of this year. Xi Shizeng is now reorganizing the municipal government in accordance with the newly promulgated municipal organization law. However, in order to save expenses, he has specifically submitted the following four items to the provincial government for approval: (1) The merger of the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Bureau of Land Affairs; (2) The fundraising for the operating expenses and subsidies for the establishment of autonomous districts and neighborhoods in the city; (3) According to the new municipal law, the governing body of the Public Security Bureau is the Police Department. This body has not yet been established. How should it be handled? (4) The police expenses account for the majority of the municipal government's expenditures. Since May of 1919, the police expenses were originally intended to be covered by the provincial treasury subsidy. Now the Finance Department owes the city a large amount of subsidies. It should be allocated immediately for disbursement or transferred to the provincial government for direct disbursement starting from 1920. After receiving the report, Chairman Lu of the Provincial Government submitted it to the 312th Provincial Affairs Conference, which decided to hand it over to Chen Jiadong, Zhang Feiran, Jiang Jilu, and Wang Yinxi for review and to formulate three measures, which were then submitted to the 313th Provincial Affairs Conference for approval. The measures are as follows: 1. Article 17 of the newly promulgated municipal organization law stipulates that if it is necessary to reduce the number of bureaus in the city, they may be changed to departments, except for the Public Security Bureau. It has been found that the organs were previously reduced due to financial difficulties in the province, and the fourth temporary public deliberation meeting decided on a method to do so. Now that the bandits and communists have not been cleared and the financial difficulties are severe, it is necessary to tighten the situation to meet the actual situation. It is proposed that the Land and Social Affairs Bureaus of the Nanchang Municipal Government be merged, and the Municipal Government shall establish an Education Department to manage the matters in Article 8, Item 10. The original Public Welfare Department of the Municipal Government shall be renamed the Department of Social Affairs and manage the matters in Article 8, Items 1 to 9. The matter in Article 8, Item 18, managed by the Land Bureau shall be considered and efforts shall be made to save money. Separate detailed staffing budgets shall be formulated and submitted to the Provincial Government for approval and implementation. 2. The subsidy for districts and neighborhoods should be properly raised by the municipal government within the urban area. The investigation and operating expenses for prior preparations should be carefully investigated and planned by the municipal government, and detailed budgets should be formulated before the Finance Department or the Budget Committee is instructed to review them. 3. The new municipal organization law stipulates that cities where the provincial government is located shall not establish a Public Security Bureau. The matters managed by the Public Security Bureau shall be managed by the provincial police agency. It has been found that there is currently no police agency in the provincial capital, and how to organize this agency has not been officially announced. It is proposed that the Nanchang Municipal Public Security Bureau be temporarily changed to the Jiangxi Provincial Public Security Bureau and directly under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Government. All internal organization and required expenses of the bureau shall still be spent according to the original plan and approved budget. After the organization of the provincial police agency is officially announced, it will be corrected in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>As for the abolition of the Jiujiang Municipal Government, the Department of Civil Affairs also convened various public organizations in Jiujiang to formulate post-abolition measures: (1) The administrative expenses of 4,200 yuan subsidized to the city shall be requested to be exempted by the provincial government; (2) The operating expenses shall be reported and paid for actual expenses; (3) The Jiujiang Municipal Public Security Bureau shall be changed to the Jiujiang County Public Security Bureau; (4) The Jiujiang Municipal Works Bureau shall be merged into the Jiujiang County Construction Bureau; (5) The Jiujiang Municipal Finance Bureau shall be merged into the County Finance Bureau; (6) The Lushan Administration Bureau shall be directly under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Government; (7) The disbanded personnel of the municipal government shall be paid one month's salary (September 12).</p>
<p>###韓復榘部搜剿膠東股匪</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Shandong’s customs are strong and fierce, known for producing bandits. Since the Xinhai Revolution, bandits have been especially numerous. In the Yan Prefecture of southern Shandong, the Cao Prefecture of western Shandong, and the Jiaodong area, there has hardly been a year or month without banditry.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The bandit disasters, coupled with continuous warfare, have led many shrewd bandit leaders to seize the opportunity to move and appease others, thereby expanding their strength. Consequently, banditry inevitably follows every military campaign. Observing the bandit situation over the years, the bandits in southern and western Shandong are fiercer than those in Jiaodong, but not as deeply rooted. Jiaodong bandits, whenever there is a military campaign, take advantage of the military's lack of preparation to create disturbances, or borrow military flags to ravage the area. When the military situation is stabilized, they disperse as civilians. Their firearms are mostly hidden deeply; those that are not hidden are used to join local defense groups, using a half-bandit, half-gentry status as protection. Therefore, although the noise of banditry in Jiaodong in recent years has not been as loud as in southern and western Shandong, the accumulated banditry is even deeper. After the recent Shandong war, western Shandong, influenced by western Henan, saw various bandit gangs raising military flags, making it difficult to distinguish between soldiers and bandits. In southern Shandong, Sun Meisong gathered a division in Yixian County last month and formed it into a regular army, which was sent to Haizhou for training, freeing the area from banditry. However, in the eastern Shandong area, because the Central Army and the Jin Army were about to engage in a major battle on the Jiaoji Railway for nearly two months, the bandit troops recruited by the Jin side in Shandong were mostly stationed in Zhoucun, Boxing, Qingzhou, and Huantai. After the Jin Army was defeated, the bandits hid in the area and committed disturbances. After Han Fuju, the commander-in-chief of the First Army Corps, came to Jinan with his troops, he ordered Cao Fulin, the commander of the Fourteenth Army, and Zhan Shuyi, the commander of the Fifty-eighth Brigade and concurrently the commander of bandit suppression in Jiaodong, to separately search and suppress bandits in various parts of eastern Shandong, and sent Li Shuchun, the chief staff officer of the First Army Corps, to supervise the suppression. In recent days, Army Commander Cao Fulin and Deputy Army Commander Xu Wenyao have led their Zhao Xinde Brigade and Rong Guangxing Brigade to separately search and suppress bandits in Huantai, Guangrao, Qingzhou, and Boxing. All bandit gangs such as Zhou Liu, Mi San, Shi Fengming, Wang Shaozhou, Zhang Erlaohu, Cai Guanjun, Caoshangfei, and Diantoutou have been completely defeated. The fierce bandit Cui Zhenlong gang in Guangrao was also exterminated on the seventh of this month. That night, Section Chief Xie Bang of the staff office of the First Army Corps received telegrams from Xu Wenyao and Li Shuchun reporting the details of the bandit suppression. On the eighth, Li Shuchun brought more than a hundred captured bandits from Xindian to Jinan to report to Han Fuju on the bandit suppression process and defense situation. The telegram from Xu Wenyao is recorded as follows: [Urgent to Jinan, Staff Office of the First Army Corps, Brother Xie Bang, Jiaodong fierce bandit Cui Zhenlong (aka Cui Jiu) occupied more than ten villages including Zhao Aizhuang, Xiao Zhang, and Zhang Zhao west of Guangrao for more than twenty years, levying grain, extorting money, looting, burning, and killing without restraint. The reason why this bandit was able to prolong his life for so long was that he took advantage of the changing situation and bribed various parties. The front-line troops in battle were unwilling to deal with him, so his power gradually grew, building walls and fortresses, resembling an emperor of the soil. This time, our brothers led the Zhao and Rong Brigades to successively suppress more than ten large and small bandit gangs such as Zhou Liu, Mi San, Shi Fengming, Wang Shaozhou, Zhang Erlaohu, Cai Guanjun, Caoshangfei, and Diantoutou. Cui became frightened and used his old trick of begging to be incorporated into the army. We were in Guangrao at the time, and because our Rong Brigade was suppressing bandits in Boxing, we could not take care of it, so we pretended to agree and temporarily ordered them to stand by in place. On the fourth, all troops had been mobilized and ordered the Rong Brigade to depart from Boxing at dawn and advance towards the area north of the bandit fortress. The Zhao Brigade, via Liyuanzi and Cheng Bingzhuang, advanced towards the area south of the bandit fortress. At ten o'clock in the morning, our Rong Brigade had eliminated the bandits of Zhang Xiahou in Xingfu Town, and the remaining bandits all fled into the Zhao and Ai Erzhuang fortresses and stubbornly resisted. At the same time, our Zhao Brigade also occupied Xiao Zhang. By twelve o'clock noon, the bandit fortress had been surrounded. We concentrated more than ten light and heavy mortars and mountain guns to bombard the bandit fortress fiercely. The bandits suffered heavy casualties. Cui personally led the cavalry to charge out several times but were repulsed. Seeing the fire starting in the fortress, the bandits were even more frightened and eagerly wanted to flee, but they were surrounded on all sides by our army and could not succeed. Then, because it was difficult to attack at night, at dawn on the sixth, we used artillery fire to force the bandits to desperately break out from the southwest gates. The Rong and Zhao Brigades intercepted them head-on, and the bandits suffered more than half casualties. Cui led the remnants of more than two hundred men out of the north gate, detouring towards the Tieshan area. Our army tracked and pursued them. At five o'clock in the afternoon, the bandits fled to Que Mountain Station and were resting. Our Zhao Brigade rushed to the scene and launched a sudden attack on the unprepared bandits, who abandoned their weapons and scattered. Coincidentally, our Rong Brigade also arrived and intercepted them on all sides. Corpses were everywhere. It has not yet been investigated whether Cui was among them. The fierce bandits who had occupied Jiaodong for more than twenty years have now been completely suppressed. In this battle, more than three hundred bandits were killed and more than one hundred were captured alive, seizing more than two hundred guns, dozens of portable guns, more than one hundred mules and horses, and more than thirty thousand rounds of various bullets. Especially reported by Xu Wenyao and Li Shuchun.] (September 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e62">Su Provincial Department of Agriculture's Opinion on Establishing a Rice Market in the Capital <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture previously received an order from the Provincial Government to assist in the case reported by the Nanjing Municipal Government regarding the preparation of a rice market, in accordance with the Executive Yuan's order. It was instructed to conduct a detailed review and report back. After review, the department submitted a report to the Provincial Government, stating: [The Fifth 019 Order of the Government instructs that, in accordance with the Executive Yuan's order, the Nanjing Municipal Government reported on the preparation of a rice market and requested assistance in a detailed review and report back, etc., and copies of the regulations and proposals were issued. Upon investigation, the establishment of a rice market in the capital has both advantages and disadvantages. In terms of advantages, after the establishment of a rice market in the capital, rice and grain from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River will inevitably gather in the capital and be distributed to various places. The sources and destinations will be clear, and the price of rice can be expected to be stable and not monopolized by a few unscrupulous merchants, and the malpractice of hoarding and speculation can also be avoided. This is one advantage. The establishment of a rice market in the capital will ensure that various miscellaneous grains will be sold smoothly along with rice and grain, and the economy of farmers in Jiangsu Province can be presented with a vibrant image. This is the second advantage. As for the disadvantages, Jiangsu Province has been implementing rice bans due to frequent disasters. If a rice market is established in the capital, this rice ban will inevitably be completely lifted, not only inconsistent with previous regulations, but also easily causing misunderstandings among the people. This is one disadvantage. Also, assuming that the rice-producing areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, such as Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan, implement rice bans or encounter poor harvests and rice and grain disappear, the capital's rice market will be empty. It will not only absorb rice and grain from Jiangsu Province, but also have a significant impact on the food supply of Jiangsu Province. This is the second disadvantage. Therefore, in the humble opinion of the department, the capital should have two prerequisites for establishing a rice market: (1) Prohibit the export of rice and grain from the country and open up domestic rice bans. The Customs is currently not prohibiting the export of rice and grain, so that at a time of national food panic, the export of rice is still happening daily, which is not a blessing for the people's livelihood. In the future, the Ministry of Finance should order customs offices in various places to strictly prohibit it. On the one hand, in order to prevent the capital's rice market from being empty and affecting the food supply in Jiangsu Province, the central government should issue an order to all provinces to open up domestic rice bans, and rice and grain should be allowed to circulate freely between provinces for regulation. Moreover, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan are the most abundant rice-producing areas in our country. The prosperity and decline of farmers' economic conditions depend entirely on whether agricultural products can be sold smoothly. If each province restricts the purchase of grain by itself, low grain prices will harm farmers, which is also not appropriate. Therefore, opening up domestic rice bans can not only relieve the emptiness of the capital's rice market, but also increase the economic capacity of farmers nationwide. (2) The capital's rice market should be organized and managed by a central agency with the aim of regulating the people's food supply, not just limited to the relief of hundreds of thousands of citizens in the capital. Before receiving orders, the reasons were gathered and the opinions were drafted and submitted to the government for review.]</p>
<h3 id="e63">Jiangsu Provincial Capital to Build Two Main Roads <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Flag Station to be Expanded</p>
<p>The Jiangsu provincial capital originally planned to build Zhongshan and Zhongzheng two main roads, as well as Jinshan Road and Boxian Road. Jinshan Road, from the station to Jinshan, was completed by the end of July. Boxian Road has not yet been built. Zhongshan Road starts from the Grand Railway Station in the west-north-east direction to the old North Gate. Zhongzheng Road starts from the South Gate Station (i.e., the Flag Station) in the south-north direction to Gaobeiqiao (planned to open a new North Gate). The intersection point is in the Dashikou east of the provincial government. It was originally planned to complete the third section of Zhongshan Road from Zhugan Lane to the North Gate and the first section of Zhongzheng Road from the Flag Station to Dashikou before the Double Tenth Festival. The Flag Station has only a single track in front of the station outside the South Gate. Only local trains and third and fourth class cars stop there, while the remaining express trains generally do not stop. This time, the starting point of Zhongzheng Road is at this station. After the road is open, the journey to the provincial government will be one-third shorter than the road from the Grand Railway Station. The provincial government had previously consulted the Railway Department to expand the South Gate Station and ordered all express trains to stop for passengers. Now the Jinghu Railway Bureau has received an order from the Railway Department to implement stops for all express trains, Beijing-Hangzhou intermodal express trains, and night express trains from September 15th. However, Zhongshan Road, one of the two main roads of the provincial capital, can barely be completed on the Double Tenth Festival, while the wooden bridge ditch of Zhongzheng Road has just been completed recently. The road surface still requires 20,000 yuan, which cannot be allocated. Although it is a dirt road, it has not been rolled flat by a road roller, and even rickshaws cannot travel. Although express trains will stop, it is still inconvenient to enter the city.</p>
<h3 id="e64">After Singapore Restricted Chinese Laborers <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The Impact on Chaoshan</p>
<p>More than 8,000 People Waiting for Ships</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Singapore government implemented restrictions on the entry of Chinese laborers on September 1st. At the end of last month, the Haitong ship had already carried back more than four hundred excess passengers. Many others from distant places who are unaware of the situation are still waiting for ships in Shantou. It is estimated that on average, more than 10,000 people go to Singapore from Shantou every month. Now, under strict restrictions, the six ships of Taikoo Foreign Company, Anqing and Andong, etc., are limited to carrying 1,715 people per month. The two ships of the Zhahua Company, Jinma and Wanfusi, are limited to 850 people per month. The three ships of the Hefeng Company, Fengqing, Fengping, and Fenghua, are limited to 810 people per month. The two ships of the Boning Company, Haixing and Xialishi, are limited to 280 people per month. It is estimated that the number of people going abroad from Shantou Port has been reduced from more than 10,000 to more than 3,600. There are currently more than 8,000 passengers waiting for ships, but those who travel in first or second class cabins and those who have passports are not subject to this restriction. Therefore, the Shantou Municipal Government had previously issued 300 passports from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which were exhausted in less than ten days. However, the procedures for obtaining a passport are extremely troublesome. Those who go abroad must submit a request to the Municipal Government. After the Municipal Government approves it, they must also have a store guarantee and be interviewed by the head of the Municipal Government before being allowed to issue it. On the 4th, the Shantou Travel Industry Association specially sent Wang Daofu and others as representatives to the Municipal Government to request improvements in the passport application procedures. Also, the boat ticket from Shantou to Singapore was 28 yuan each. After September 1st, the price was increased to 36 yuan. Ordinary passengers cannot buy tickets directly from foreign companies. The number of tickets is controlled by the inns of the Travel Industry Association. Inns have recently taken the opportunity to raise prices, selling each ticket for 45 yuan. The inns opened by the Meixian Dabu gang sell each ticket for 56 yuan. They said that they cannot maintain their business without doing so. Although the ticket price is high, the shipping companies are also complaining incessantly and have been increasing cargo capacity in recent days to make up for the losses. According to shipping companies, the Singapore government has set a time limit of three months, so they have no choice but to endure and maintain the status quo. If this regulation continues to be effective after November, the shipping companies will inevitably not sit idly by and will only have to divert ships to other ports. The Fenghua of the Hetong Company and the Haixing of the Boning Company have already sailed to other places. (September 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Crisis for Chinese Laborers in Nanyang is Increasingly Urgent <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Siam Follows British Colonies in Restricting Foreigners' Entry</p>
<p>Dutch Colonies Increase Entry Tax by 150 Guilders</p>
<p>Malay and Indian Laborers Usurping the Position of Chinese Laborers</p>
<p>Nanyang Special Dispatch: The Nanyang Islands are located in the tropics, where summer-like greenery persists year-round. But who is responsible for today's prosperity? The most famous industries in Nanyang are rubber and tin. Who is it that collects drops of latex and smelts lumps of tin ore into commodities that are sold worldwide? Let us try to analyze the development history of the Nanyang Islands to find the reasons for their prosperity. Although there are many, the hardworking Chinese laborers have made a considerable contribution. The number of Chinese laborers living in various ports in Nanyang is the largest (approximately 2.3 million in the Malay Peninsula). During the European War, Chinese laborers occupied the most important position in Nanyang. It was the Chinese laborers who maintained the Nanyang industries from closing down. It was also the Chinese laborers who reclaimed wasteland and built roads. After the European War, as the prices of rubber and tin rose daily, Chinese laborers took advantage of their spirit of hard work and struggle to obtain a superior economic position. Taking rubber workers as an example, they can earn an average of three yuan per day (rubber cutting workers are paid according to the number of catties, the more they cut, the more they earn). There has been a reason why the country has regarded Nanyang as a source of wealth. In addition, the motherland has been plagued by natural and man-made disasters in recent years, social order has not been stable, and the level of life has been increasing day by day. Therefore, those who leave their hometowns and go abroad to Nanyang come shoulder to shoulder, thinking that if they go to the South Island, even if they cannot return home full of money, they will still have enough to wear and eat. Who knows that the crisis for Chinese laborers in Nanyang has been secretly spread around them? This is not a reporter's alarmist talk, but there are facts to show us: (1) The Malay Peninsula restricts the import of Chinese laborers. (2) Siam promulgated immigration regulations. (3) The Dutch East Indies increased import taxes. The three are described in detail as follows:</p>
<p>Since the price of rubber and tin has plummeted, the fear of unemployment has spread throughout the South Island. Sir Cecil Clementi, Governor of Malaya, announced on August 1st that the import of Chinese laborers would be restricted for three months. During the months of August, September, and October, only 5,000 Chinese immigrants per month were allowed to land in Singapore, and the quota was allocated to various shipping companies. If there is an excess, they will be ordered to be transported back to China. According to the regulations of the Straits Settlements government in Malaya, any decree issued by the Governor must be approved by the Legislative Council. If the restriction on the import of Chinese laborers is not passed by the Legislative Council, it can only be implemented for one month (this is the Governor's special power). Now, on August 25, the Legislative Council has passed this case, so the restriction on the import of Chinese laborers can undoubtedly be implemented for three months. It is still difficult to predict whether it will be extended when it expires. However, this regulation does not restrict the import of women. The reason is that [the gender ratio of imported Chinese can be improved slightly]. Seeing this, the number of Chinese laborers coming to Malaya in the future has been reduced by two-thirds. (According to statistics from the seven states of Malaya, a total of 17,383 Chinese immigrants entered in July of this year. Since the news of the restriction on Chinese laborers was transmitted to the motherland, the price of passenger tickets to Xiamen and Shantou has reportedly increased from more than ten yuan to forty yuan, and some have increased to forty-eight yuan in Shantou. Moreover, there are many passengers and no tickets, and they are competing to buy them, which shows the great impact on the people's livelihood in Fujian and Guangdong.)</p>
<p>Amidst the restrictions on the import of Chinese laborers in Malaya, the Siamese government also announced immigration laws restricting the entry of foreigners. The immigration laws promulgated by Siam consist of ten articles (as seen in previous reports). Siam and our country have not mutually sent ministers. Previously, Chinese compatriots entering Siam had to pay a body fee of 15 sen per person, which is approximately 20 yuan in national currency. This time, the immigration laws promulgated by Siam were translated by the Japanese Minister to Siam and forwarded to our country. Therefore, whether overseas Chinese can enter the country in accordance with the provisions of the regulations is what our government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs hopes to discuss good methods to resolve the doubts of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>The government of the Dutch East Indies colonial territory decided to increase taxes to compensate for the lack of entry and exit budget for next year. The most relevant to overseas Chinese is that from 1931, the import tax (dock tax) per person will be increased from 100 guilders to 150 guilders, and the commercial stamp tax will be doubled compared to the old rules. Since the distribution last month, the general chambers of commerce in Medan and Bacheng, regardless of Chinese, Malay, or Indian, have petitioned to reduce the stamp tax, which may be reduced, but the dock tax cannot be reduced. The most bizarre thing is that contracted laborers entering the country (that is, what our country calls "piglets") must also pay half of the dock tax, which is 75 guilders. Contracted laborers were originally a private trafficking of people, which was most prevalent in Fujian and Guangdong provinces a few years ago and has now been slightly reduced. According to old regulations, contracted laborers entering Dutch territory did not pay the dock tax, but only paid a stamp tax of one and a half guilders at the end of the contract period (during the contract period, there is work but no wages) to obtain a residence permit and be allowed to live freely in Dutch territory. According to the newly promulgated regulations, Chinese laborers whose contract has expired must pay a landing tax of 75 guilders before being allowed to reside. The increase in taxes for contracted laborers is so huge that it has caused major debates in the Dutch Indian National Assembly, but there is no concrete solution. Therefore, the increase in the dock tax is inevitable, as it has been included in the next year's entry budget. However, Chinese laborers entering Dutch territory, if they enter freely, should pay a dock tax of 150 guilders from next year. If they are contracted laborers, they should pay a dock tax of 75 guilders, which is inevitable.</p>
<p>Overall, the current crisis for Chinese laborers in Nanyang is like this, and the future difficulties are like that. The superior position in the past may be cut off by this. Moreover, in recent years, Indian and Malay laborers have been competing with Chinese laborers for jobs more and more fiercely. Malay and Indian people think it is a great opportunity because their lives are simple and they have wages of two to three cents per day. Chinese laborers win by their working skills, and their work efficiency cannot be reached by Indian and Malay laborers. However, wages are too high, and they must have at least five cents per day to survive. Therefore, all mechanical work such as rubber cutting and tin mining in various gardens and mines has mostly abandoned expensive Chinese laborers and hired Indian and Malay laborers. Chinese laborers in Nanyang are rarely able to endure hardships, and most of them only care about the present and waste money recklessly. They already lack private savings, and they are far behind the Japanese, who can be diligent and thrifty, reclaim wasteland and build bridges, and accumulate huge sums of money in less than ten years before returning home. Once they lose their jobs and buy boats to return home, they still rely on friends to help them, which is common. Therefore, since the business market has been cold and unemployment has increased sharply, the wandering and helpless Chinese laborers have caused infinite pain. Singapore and Penang have sent old and weak Chinese laborers back to China, totaling more than 3,000 people. This is just a drop in the bucket. There are still many people who live in the open air and have nowhere to live. If this continues, unemployed Chinese laborers will never have a way out and can only hope to return home. Japan and the Americas have already expelled Chinese laborers from their countries. Chinese laborers in Nanyang have also returned to their countries due to the fear of unemployment, only to make the number of unemployed in the country more rampant. The people's livelihood and the national economy are concerned, which is not light. What will people with good intentions do to deal with the aftermath? I really hope for it.

After the robbers left, the victims reported the case to the commander of the third squad of the 15th Public Security Team stationed in Fanshui, Lu Wuben, who requested an arrest warrant and reported the case to the third district of the Public Security Bureau in this area for verification.</p>
<p>Party and Government Joint Trial of Reactionary Case: Since the 97th Anniversary, the Public Security Bureau has successively arrested twenty-one people suspected of being reactionary, including Song, Song Linhheshang, Song Zhaocai, Kong Shaoxi, Wu Jinli, Wang Yutian, Hu Zhiji, Wang Zhangxian, Gu Chaoyan, Song Yucheng, Li Hong, Chen Ping, Pan Agen, Dai Amao, Pan Afu, Zhou Akun, Pan Qingbao, Liu Arong, Yao Xuan, Wang Pansheng, and Huang Chuntao. After a brief interrogation by Zhang, the director of the Judicial Section, it was determined that ten people, including Wu Jinli, Wang Yutian, Wang Zhangxian, Gu Chaoyan, Song Yucheng, Pan Agen, Dai Amao, Pan Afu, Zhou Akun, and Pan Qingbao, were unlikely to be suspects and were released on bail the day before. The remaining eleven people, including Song Qin and Yao Xuyan, are still being temporarily detained at the Public Security Bureau. At 10 PM the night before (the 12th), Director Zou, the county party committee member, and others jointly interrogated them and submitted the case to the provincial government for instructions.</p>
<p>Interesting News About the Arrest of the Regiment Commander: On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, the Wu County Party Department suddenly received a person holding a commission from the Third Regiment of the Central Army for the Suppression of Rebels, Xu Huaihai Guerrilla Headquarters, to deliver it to Bo Gonglei, the party committee member and organization minister. Because Committee Member Bo did not know the regiment commander Wang Zhenya and had not contacted him beforehand, he immediately interrogated the messenger, Mr. Fang. According to Mr. Fang, Regiment Commander Wang is currently living in the Xie family's home at No. 64 Zhongyouji Lane. Because Committee Member Bo had been searching for the Communist Party very strictly in Suzhou in recent days, he feared that the Communist Party might be disrupting things, so he immediately sent Mr. Fang and the original commission to the Second Branch of the County Public Security Bureau for investigation. The chief of the branch, Pan, immediately sent personnel to arrest Regiment Commander Wang. Wang had already left for Shanghai and was immediately tracked to the station. At around 9 PM, Wang was spotted trying to board a train on the station platform and was arrested and taken to the bureau. According to Wang, he is currently the commander of the Third Replenishment Regiment of the Xu Huaihai Guerrilla Headquarters and was commissioned as a councilor because he knew Bo. The situation was confusing for a while, and Wang was immediately escorted to the headquarters to be interrogated by the chief of the Judicial Section. According to Wang, he had been a monk in a temple in Wufunong and had dealings with Bo from time to time, but they had been separated for many years. After Committee Member Bo went to the bureau to identify him, Wang was immediately released, and the incident became a laughing stock.</p>

<p>The Director of the Finance Bureau was replaced yesterday. Chen Liangdong, the Director of the County Finance Bureau, recently resigned to the Provincial Finance Department due to his inability to raise various funds for the province and county. His resignation was approved, and Zhuang Yeguang was appointed to fill the vacancy in Wuxi. Chen was transferred to the Department to serve as an inspector. After receiving his appointment, Zhuang arrived in Wuxi from the province on the afternoon of the 12th and took over his duties at the Bureau at 9 a.m. on the 13th.</p>
<p>Two Sisters Drowned While Gathering Water Caltrop. Hui, a resident of Huijiali in the Eleventh District (Nanyan City) of the county, had two daughters. The elder, named Axiu, was 18 years old, and the younger, Jinmei, was 10 years old. Both were beautiful and had been betrothed. In the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at 4 p.m., Jinmei and Axiu rode together in a water caltrop basin to gather water caltrop in a nearby water caltrop field. Unexpectedly, while traveling halfway across the river, they accidentally capsized, and both fell into the river. They cried loudly for help. People who heard the news rushed to rescue them. Axiu was rescued before she drowned, but when Jinmei was pulled out, she had already drowned.</p>
<p>Autumn Cocoons Are Successively Weighed. The autumn sericulture season in the four rural districts of Wuxi has begun, and the main groups of silk workers have long since gone to work. Silk trading firms on the east and west roads have also successively opened their scales on the days before yesterday. A total of 95 silk trading firms have been reported to have opened for business, with a better supply of cocoons than last year. The Southern Spring, Shitou, Gongtai, and Chang silk trading firms quoted a price of 45 yuan per dan. The various firms in Zhouxin Town quoted prices ranging from 40 yuan to 45 yuan per dan. In the northern rural areas, such as Qianzhou and Yuqi, the silk trading firms quoted prices ranging from 50 yuan to 60 yuan per dan. In Tangtou, Shitou, and other places, the quoted price was 53.5 yuan per dan.</p>
<p>The Construction Committee Pays Attention to Electric Irrigation. In recent years, most of the farmland irrigation in Wuxi, Changzhou, and other counties has been done using water-lifting machines. Since the Construction Committee took over the Qishuyan Power Plant in Changzhou, villagers have mostly used electric power for irrigation, and the cost of farmland irrigation is lower than that of machine-operated water lifting. However, due to the lack of adequate equipment at the Qishuyan Power Plant in Wuxi, machine-operated water lifting is still used. Recently, the Construction Committee decided to build a large Gaoqiao power plant near Gaoqiao outside the North Gate of Wuxi. The plant's planning is currently underway, and construction is scheduled to begin within the year. In the future, after the large power plant is established, farmland irrigation and factories in various counties will be greatly facilitated.</p>
<p>Yixing Requests Suppression of Bandit Remnants in Taihu Lake. Since the Taihu Lake bandits were extensively suppressed by the government and police, they have dispersed and fled everywhere, causing disturbances. Recently, a group of lake bandits has been harassing various villages and towns along the lake in Yixing, looting everywhere. Sun Gongqi, the magistrate of Yixing County, telegraphed the Second Water Police District stationed in Wuxi yesterday, requesting that a warship be dispatched to patrol the lake along Yixing to clear out the remnants of the bandits. Mao Mujun, the chief of the Water Police District, immediately ordered the Baosu shallow-water warship to sail to various places along the lake in Yixing to patrol carefully.</p>

<p>Rejection of the Request to Return Lost Firearms and Ammunition. He Zhan'ao, the former commander of the 20th Detachment of the Water and Fertilizer Security Team, was dismissed and punished for a case involving the transport of opium. He was granted bail by the district headquarters to come to Cheng to handle the handover. Because the armed forces were disarmed and the number of firearms and ammunition was lost when checking soil on the river surface and the Jiang boat was destroyed, and Water Patrolman Wang Bingsheng was detained alone, the district requested the district headquarters to negotiate for their return. District Chief Jiang issued an order stating that it was suspicious that two missing box cannons were not recovered when other firearms were negotiated for and returned. The case has been transferred to the office for jurisdiction. The commander should file a petition in the court in the future. The request is not approved. As for the missing 83 rounds of pistol bullets and 160 rounds of Guangdong-made bullets, a total of 343 rounds should be counted, but the report only counts 210 rounds in total. The previous report did not clarify the supplementary statement, and it was fabricated that the missing ammunition was not due to the transfer. Who would believe it? The commander should be responsible for compensating for the missing ammunition and handing it over to the successor. Not a single missing round is allowed to prevent the recurrence of the incident with military supplies. The boat was damaged and the same thing as the box cannon was investigated.</p>
<p>Commissioner for Comforting Wounded Soldiers Visits Cheng. Peng Dingjun, the chief military judge of the 8th Division of the Army, was ordered by the division commander to comfort the wounded soldiers of the division in the rear hospitals along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Peng visited Cheng the day before yesterday and went to the No. 25 Rear Hospital in Shifang'an, Nanwai, in the afternoon to meet with Director Wu and distribute the borrowed expenses for July and August to the soldiers, each receiving 8 or 9 yuan. After finishing the business, he left Cheng.</p>
<p>Cai Rushan Arrested in Changzhou. Cai Rushan, a resident of Zhouzhuang, specialized in delivering the Zhouzhuang Minsheng Business News in the city. Later, he served as a trainee reporter for Minsheng for more than a year. He resigned on the 26th of last month. Minsheng suspended publication three days ago due to economic reasons. Cai Rushan was arrested in Changzhou three days ago for a case. Li, the director of the Public Security Bureau, went to Changzhou in person on the 12th to greet him and brought him back to Cheng on the 13th.</p>

The Wu County Public Security Bureau's detective team learned through secret investigation in Yutang that there was a fake battalion commander named Chen Tiansheng (i.e., Chen Tiangen) who was gathering party members in the town, which was detrimental to public security. They immediately joined forces with the security regiment to arrest Chen and found a letter of appointment from the headquarters of the Sixth Division of the Second Army of the Fake Party Rescue National Army. He was escorted to Longhutang and taken to the city by Tang Hongming, the deputy captain of the detective team. He was sent to the Public Security Bureau on the 11th and to the County Office on the 12th for interrogation.</p>
<p>Seven Bandits Captured in Xiaohu Town. Banditry is rampant in the Wucheng border area. Recently, a large group of bandits from Jiangyin has also been active in the Longhutang and Xiaohu areas. On the 12th, the Xishiqiao Security Regiment received a report that five or sixty bandits with firearms were hiding in a teahouse in Xiaohu and went to encircle and arrest them. They captured an armed bandit and found a box cannon next to him. They then captured six more people, and the remaining bandits scattered. The regiment sent the witnesses and evidence to the team for interrogation.</p>

<p>Arrest for Smoking Opium Leads to Death. Lu Haifan, the chief of the Eighth Public Security Branch Bureau (Juegang) of the county, heard that Zhou Youxiang, a wealthy man in Huanzhen in the western countryside of the district, was smoking opium. He sent police officers to arrest him, but Zhou had gone out and only a few opium paraphernalia were found. After Zhou returned and learned of the situation, he asked the two managers to intercede with Lu, asking him to exempt him from investigation, but Lu would only agree to drop the matter if Zhou paid 500 yuan. Zhou, unable to raise the money, secretly took a boat to Tong on the 7th to discuss the matter with his son. Lu discovered this and sent many police officers to track him down. They caught up with Zhou in Nanwanzi, Hongqiao, eight or nine li west of Juegang Street. Unexpectedly, Zhou was old and weak and was accidentally knocked unconscious by the police officers and fell into the river. He could not be rescued and died, causing a sensation in the city.

<p>Dispute Over Police Officer Replacement. Yesterday, it was reported that after the heads and members of the various bureaus under the Municipal Public Security Bureau were reassigned by the Civil Affairs Department, except for Yang Chao, the head of the Second District Bureau, and the members of the First District, First Branch Bureau, and the Second Branch Bureau of the Third District, who had taken office successively, the other original heads and members of the various bureaus were accused by the newly appointed officers of disobeying orders and refusing to hand over their duties, leading to disputes. It is now learned that the matter may be difficult to resolve for a while. The municipal government received a confidential telegram from the provincial government instructing it to temporarily delay the replacement of old and new officers and wait for further orders. However, the Civil Affairs Department telegraphed back ordering the original officers to hand over their duties immediately without delay. The original police officers were happy to postpone the handover, and the newly appointed officers had no choice but to return to the province together. It is still difficult to predict the outcome.</p>

<p>Nest of Bandits Raid Small Steamer. Water bandits have been discovered in Chaohu Lake in recent months, and passengers are wary. On the 7th, more than ten people, including doctor Liu Hongxun and merchant Han Shigui, were traveling by boat through Chaohu Lake and were robbed clean by bandits near Mount Mu. At noon on the 8th, a small steamer of the Three Companies sailing from Wuchao to Fei was surrounded by four or five bandit boats when it arrived at the waters of Mount Lao in Chaohu Lake. The bandits fired their guns and ordered the boat to stop. The bandits boarded the boat and searched the passengers and the staff of the disaster relief center, stealing everything and loading the stolen goods onto the boat before fleeing. Fortunately, none of the passengers were killed. The steamer arrived in Fei in the evening. According to them, several rice merchants who had come to Fei to buy rice were among the passengers and were carrying a large amount of money, so the losses were estimated at 30,000 to 40,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Jiangsu Education Department Orders the Issuance of Measures for the Transfer of State-Run Educational Institutions <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Education Department issues an order to the 61 county education bureaus, all primary and secondary schools, and all social relief institutions to issue temporary measures for the transfer of property, temporary measures for the settlement of pending cases, and a transfer form, and to comply with them. The order states: "The Provincial Government Order No. 4877 states: 'The case of the JiangSu Provincial State-run Education Agency Transfer Temporary Measures and Cleaning up Old Cases Transfer Temporary Measures submitted by the Editorial and Examination Committee was discussed at the 321st meeting of the Provincial Government Committee. The case has been reviewed and amended and is requested for consideration. The case has been approved and recorded, and the two measures are issued with this order. The department chief is ordered to conduct a thorough investigation and comply with this order.' In light of the importance of educational funding and the need for responsible custodianship, the chiefs of all educational institutions in the province have not been able to standardize the procedures for the handover of educational funding due to the lack of fixed procedures, resulting in a lack of evidence for auditing and accounting and a lack of seriousness in the handover of educational funds. In view of this, the department has drafted temporary measures for the transfer of property and temporary measures for the settlement of pending cases and submitted them to the Provincial Government Committee for review, deliberation and amendment. A notification is hereby issued. All current personnel should strictly comply with the procedures when they retire in the future. If there is any violation, they will be punished according to law. The former personnel who have not completed the transfer and acting personnel who have not settled their accounts should be ordered by the current personnel to investigate in detail and report to the department in accordance with the prescribed form within ten days of receiving this document for verification. In addition to issuing separate orders, the bureau chief is ordered to comply and instruct all subordinates to comply."</p>

<p>Article 1: If the president of a state-run school, the person in charge of a social education institution, or the director of a county education bureau who left office after the reorganization in 1927 has not completed the transfer, the current person in charge should investigate the name and report it to the Education Department.

<h3 id="e86">Ministry of Education Sends Personnel to Manage the Director of the Antiquities Preservation Institute <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, in view of the fact that Wei Zhenxian, the director of the Antiquities Preservation Institute, has requested leave to return to his hometown, has specially appointed Shu Chushi, a staff member of the Social Education Department, to act as the director. In view of the news that Wei's letter to the newspaper contained the message "How can the Ministry of Education privatize antiquities?", a formal letter has been sent to correct the situation. The following is an excerpt of the explanation: (1) Wei's letter stated, "The Ministry of Education has transported away 1,084 copies of ancient books and books stored in the Nanjing Antiquities Preservation Institute." The institute's books total 1,096 copies. The Ministry believed that the institute's space was small and that it would not be able to build a reading room in a short period of time, so it ordered the books to be transported to the Ministry's library for safekeeping. When they were transported, Director Wei, for the convenience of reference, submitted a request to retain 254 copies of books related to archaeology at the institute. A total of 826 copies were actually transported to the Ministry, as documented. Sixteen copies are still missing, and the director has not submitted them for review. They are currently being investigated. The original letter stated that 1,084 copies were transported away, which is inconsistent with the facts. Moreover, the Ministry of Education is a state agency. How can the transfer of books to the Ministry for preservation be described as privatizing antiquities? (2) Wei's letter stated, "The ancient wood of the Song Dynasty was given to the private, unaccredited Datong Music Society, and Yan resigned as the director of the Nanjing Antiquities Preservation Institute as a result." In June of this year, the Datong Music Society came to the Ministry to request the wood unearthed from the Ming Palace to be used to imitate 140 kinds of ancient musical instruments with verifiable diagrams. Each type was to be made in eight copies, which were to be sent to the capital and educational and cultural institutions in various ports, as well as to Europe, the United States, and Japan. The society's aim was to restore ancient music, which was commendable. The society has been established for ten years, and all its publishing, imitation, compilation, and training work have been successful. Li Shizeng, Cai Ziming, Chu Minyi, Wang Xiaolun, and Zheng Yimen have all been executive members of the society. The Ministry of Education, which is in charge of education, promotes and rewards aesthetic education. This is one of the responsibilities of the Ministry of Education's administrative functions. The Ministry granted the request and approved the allocation, but Director Wei, who had planned to sell the wood himself (the director submitted a report to the Ministry on November 15 of last year, stating that he planned to leave a portion of the unearthed bricks and wood for preservation and sell the rest. The bricks, about 4,000 to 5,000, could be sold for four cents each, for a total of 200 yuan. The wooden boards, about 100 or so, could be sold for three yuan each, for a total of 300 yuan, and used as building materials (Director Wei submitted a report to the Ministry in June of this year, stating that if the large wooden boards unearthed from the Forbidden City were used as building materials, only the labor of workers and the cost of tiles, charcoal, and mud would be required, saving 400 yuan), was angered and resigned. (3) Wei's submission stated, "After reporting the negotiations with Zheng Yusun of the Datong Music Society, the request to excavate the ancient relics of Fenyin was rejected, and the concurrent post of editor was removed, resulting in oppression everywhere." Since Wei took office, more than one and a half years have passed. The Ministry has found that the antiquities in the institute are displayed in a disorderly manner, many of which are unnumbered. The temporary expenses that have been claimed on several occasions have not been submitted for calculation. This phenomenon may be due to the fact that the director has multiple concurrent positions and his energy is scattered, resulting in the stagnation of the institute's affairs. The institute is now in urgent need of reorganization, and the director should be required to devote himself to the affairs of the institute. Therefore, the request to excavate the ancient relics of Fenyin was rejected, and the concurrent post of editor was removed. This was purely for the purpose of reorganizing and preserving the contents of the institute. The director has combined these two matters with the case of the Datong Music Society receiving wood. (4) The current situation of the institute: Wei has now requested leave to return to his hometown. The Ministry believes that the institute is important and has sent Shu Chushi, a staff member of the Social Affairs Department, to act as the director and ordered him to reorganize the institute and number and register all the antiquities for record. When Wei left the institute, he did not register the antiquities for transfer to Shu. Therefore, the number of new and old antiquities recorded in the original letter will be reported after Shu has conducted a thorough inventory and numbering. The above items are for special correction.</p>

<p>(Berlin, September 8) The second and third days of the World Women's Games on the 7th and 8th of this month were met with enthusiastic audiences. Germany surprisingly surpassed Japan and took the lead in the medal count. The previous champion, the Japanese athlete, suffered a defeat and failed to maintain her dominance in the 100-meter race, only winning in the long jump. The record for long jump was 6.07 meters in the previous Games, but it regressed to 5.90 meters this time. The three events that the Japanese athlete was most confident in also regressed to second place. The overall winner in this edition of the Games was the Polish athlete Walasiewicz, who won the top spot in the 100-meter, 200-meter, and 60-meter races. The records in this edition of the Games were not particularly outstanding compared to the previous edition, except for the javelin, which produced a new world record.

<h3 id="e99">Li Zhonggong, New Director-General of China Merchants Bureau, Assumes Office Yesterday <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Wang Boqun Attended the Ceremony</p>
<p>Song Shuqiao Appointed Secretary-General</p>
<p>Li Zhonggong, the newly appointed Director-General of the China Merchants Bureau, assumed office yesterday morning at 10:00 AM in the large office hall on the second floor of the China Merchants Bureau. All the bureau's staff attended to offer congratulations. The guests included Wang Boqun, Minister of Transportation and concurrently Supervisor of the China Merchants Bureau, Liu Yunfang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office, Zhuang Zhihuan, Director of the Telecommunications Department, and over ten reporters from various newspapers. The ceremony concluded at 11:30 AM. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Order of Inauguration Ceremony: The inauguration ceremony had already been planned, but yesterday, an item of remarks from the Supervisor was temporarily added, as follows: (1) All stand at attention; (2) Sing the Party song; (3) Pay the highest respects to the national flag and the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen; (4) Read the will of Dr. Sun Yat-sen; (5) All staff bow to the new Director-General to congratulate him on his appointment; (6) Remarks from the Supervisor; (7) Remarks from the Director-General; (8) Speeches from guests; (9) Photography.</p>
<p>Wang Boqun's Speech: At 9:45 AM yesterday morning, Li Zhonggong, accompanied by Cai Pei and the bureau's secretaries, arrived at the bureau. Shortly after, Wang Boqun and others also arrived in succession. The ceremony began at 10:00 AM. After the ceremony, Wang Boqun delivered a speech, stating that the China Merchants Bureau has a considerable history in China's shipping industry. Since the establishment of the national government, efforts have been made to reorganize it, but it has been subjected to pressure from imperialism and affected by the situation, coupled with the extreme lack of shipping talent in the country and the deep-seated bad habits within the China Merchants Bureau itself. As a result, the reorganization has shown little success in three years, and the government feels deeply indebted, and is very sorry to society. Comrade Zhao, who worked hard, sacrificed himself, which is even more painful. Now that the military affairs will soon end, the order in various places is gradually being restored. The national government is studying the fundamental methods for the China Merchants Bureau and has first appointed Vice Minister Li Zhonggong to take over as Director-General, acting as a Commissioner. Director-General Li has worked with me for many years and has been working hard on revolutionary work for many years and has been extremely responsible in his work. As long as the national government determines the direction, it will follow this direction, which will hopefully be more advanced than before. The fundamental issues of shipping administration are clearly stated in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and internal policies, and the government will definitely follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions to properly plan and formulate methods. Secondly, regarding the inland waterway rights, which have long been under the pressure of imperialism, the national government is also actively trying to recover them. Domestic shipping agencies should be prepared. The China Merchants Bureau is the only shipping company in our country and bears the most important responsibility. During this reorganization period, all responsible personnel should work together. I have great expectations.</p>

<p>Li Zhonggong's Speech: Subsequently, the new Director-General Li Zhonggong delivered a speech, stating that colleagues and comrades, I have been appointed to the China Merchants Bureau, and I know that my talents are insufficient to shoulder the burden, but I am obliged to do so because of the government's supervision and society's expectations, and because the China Merchants Bureau has a major mission in national economy, people's livelihood, political training, and construction, and the current problems urgently need to be solved. I do not want my personal arrival and departure to cause it to suffer unnecessary experiences in the two demands of resolving crises and striving for construction, so today I have reluctantly come to the bureau to start and do my best. At this time, I dare not say what great plans I have for the China Merchants Bureau. However, I only want to temporarily take responsibility, based on the guidance of the Central Government, to the best of my ability, in the difficulties that are generally considered difficult, and strive to overcome the difficulties with the spirit of sacrifice. Since its establishment, the China Merchants Bureau has competed with Jardine Matheson, Taikoo, and various German, Japanese, and French companies. Although it is now under pressure from the major foreign forces of Britain and Japan and is becoming increasingly difficult, it is still the only Chinese shipping company with considerable strength in the past fifty years. We cannot deny that it occupies an important position in transportation, economy, military affairs, and even national defense, culture, and foreign trade. Currently, everyone thinks that the China Merchants Bureau is in a most dangerous period, and the common lament is the overlapping debts and poor business. However, I think this is only the superficial difficulty. In addition, there are internal difficulties, namely the government, which has the responsibility of supervising and supporting the shipping industry, the shareholders who hold shares, the personnel who handle the business, and the public opinion that should bear the responsibility of guidance cannot work together and stand on the entire national and social standpoint to jointly maintain its development. The former is the result, and the latter is the cause. If the internal difficulties can be resolved, it will not only be easy to deal with the current situation, but also easy to fundamentally reorganize. Conversely, if this point is not resolved, even if some funds are raised temporarily, it will not help the fundamental plan. I very much want to find a solution to the whole problem from this factor. Dr. Sun Yat-sen analyzed in his speech on nationalism that the decline of China's shipping power was one of the reasons why foreign economic forces were able to penetrate China. This theory can be well explained by the decline of the China Merchants Bureau. I think that the shipping industry of a country, no matter which country or which ideology is established, will be difficult to resist the competition from foreign forces in this era of fierce commercial warfare and the neglect of shipping without the support of the government. However, at the same time, if a country's enterprise does not have appropriate methods to encourage national investment and protect its interests, it will be difficult for it to achieve long-term progress. I intend to determine the reorganization procedures under the principle of developing national and social enterprises and safeguarding investment interests, so that the government can choose. In other words, I want to do my best, together with my colleagues, under the guidance of the government and the supervision of the society, to directly develop business and shareholder interests, and indirectly promote national and social enterprises to a prosperous and prosperous state. As for the duties, the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee decided that the reorganization of the China Merchants Bureau should be decided by a government-organized committee and appoint a commissioner to take full responsibility for the reorganization. The government has now passed the reorganization regulations. Before the committee is formed, I will act as Director-General on behalf of the Commissioner. Although I am responsible for reorganizing and managing the overall situation, the fundamental nature of the bureau, whether it is government-run, commercial-run, or jointly government-run and commercial-run, must be decided by the government. I am only one of the members who adopt the opinions of all parties and implement the government's orders, bearing the temporary responsibility of reorganization. Therefore, most of my work will have to be concentrated on resolving the current situation. Once the reorganization is slightly completed, I will resign and give way to a wise man. As for employing personnel and administration, I dare to use the four points of talent, scientific management, elimination of accumulated malpractices, and strict integrity to encourage all colleagues. I am bound by the Party and the country, and I have never acted impartially or favored anyone. I take Party discipline and national law as the standard for advancement, retreat, rewards, and penalties. I hope that all colleagues will take the interests of the Party and the country as the premise and focus on the cause of the bureau, work with peace of mind, and cooperate fully to make the difficulties that everyone sees as difficulties a new situation.</p>
<p>Expresses to Reporters: After Li's speech, Chen Jia of the Capital Garrison Command delivered a speech on behalf of the guests. After the photography ceremony, reporters from various newspapers visited Li to inquire about various issues of the China Merchants Bureau. Li replied that the government is still seriously considering the fundamental policy of the China Merchants Bureau. I have served in the Ministry of Communications for several years and have a general understanding of the surface of the China Merchants Bureau, but the inside is still unclear. This time, I will take some time to conduct a detailed investigation and make a systematic report for the government to decide on the policy. It is expected that the fundamental policy will be fully determined in two or three months. Maintaining the status quo is the most difficult. The bureau's scattered debts of about two million yuan urgently need to be paid. I will do my best to plan to raise two million yuan at once, so that the urgent debts can be completely cleared. Otherwise, I can only do my best to the extent of my ability, and then eliminate accumulated malpractices and save expenses, so as to gradually equalize revenue and expenditure.</p>
<p>Membership of the Reorganization Committee: Li also said that the number of members of the Reorganization Committee is set at nine. The reports published in the newspapers are mostly speculation and are not yet certain. The government originally intended to announce the members of the Reorganization Committee before I took office, but now it advocates postponing it, probably because it wants to fully consider the issue of personnel. The government hopes that the future Reorganization Committee will be able to do things in a practical way, otherwise it will be in vain and do nothing. The regulations for the reorganization of the China Merchants Bureau have been officially passed by the National Government Council, but they cannot be published yet. It can be revealed that the Reorganization Committee is a supervisory body. The Commissioner implements the government's decisions and takes full responsibility for the administrative implementation of the government's decisions, and cancels the current supervisory position. However, no matter how it is reformed, the rights of shareholders must be safeguarded. As for the abolition of investment interests and the forceful nationalization, this is absolutely impossible. Such unfounded rumors have repeatedly occurred in the outside world, causing misunderstandings between the government and shareholders, which also hinders the development of the bureau's affairs. It is said that Li will officially take office starting on the 15th, and will set another date to hold a supplementary swearing-in ceremony and request the National Government to send personnel to supervise the oath. Cai Pei, the former Acting Director-General, has already handed over everything and will rest in Shanghai for a while before going to Nanjing on the 15th to return to the Director of the Shipping Administration Department.</p>
<p>Appointment of New Staff: After the inauguration ceremony, Li met with the directors of various branch bureaus and appointed Song Shuqiao as the Secretary-General of the General Management Office, Huang Minghao as the Secretary, Lu Qinghai as the Acting Chief of the General Affairs Section, Zhou Shian as the Secretary, Kong Xiangrong as the Acting Chief of the Accounting Section, Wang Yujun as the Acting Director of the Treasury, and Zhang Yanyou as the staff member. Li then telegraphed Jiang, reporting his inauguration, briefly stating that he was serving as the Director-General of the China Merchants Bureau and concurrently Commissioner by order of the National Government. He respectfully arrived at the bureau today to take over the affairs. The swearing-in ceremony will be held at another date, and personnel will be invited to supervise the oath. The China Merchants Bureau is of great importance in military affairs, transportation, economy, and culture. Please give clear instructions at any time so that I can follow them and avoid making mistakes. I am very grateful for the opportunity to continue to report. Li Zhonggong bows respectfully.</p>
<p>Li's Brief Biography: Huadong News Agency reports that Li is from Guizhou, 39 years old, a member of the Chinese Nationalist Party. He graduated from the Political and Economic Department of the Beijing National College of Law and Politics in the second year of the Republic and then went to Japan to study political economy.

He was the Party Representative of the Twenty-first Army, a member of the Jiangxi Provisional Political Conference, and the Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters' Third Plenary Session. He was the Secretary-General of the Military Rehabilitation Conference of the National Revolutionary Army, the Secretary-General of the National Army Reorganization Conference, a Special Commissioner handling matters after Guizhou, a member of the Guizhou Provincial Government and concurrently Director of the Civil Affairs Department, and is currently also the Vice Minister of Transportation.</p>

<p>Returning by the Taiyo Maru</p>
<p>Report Being Printed</p>
<p>Huang Boqiao, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, was previously appointed by the Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hankou Municipal Governments to represent them at the Second World Power Conference held in Geneva. Huang was also entrusted by the National Government's Construction Commission and the Chinese Institute of Engineers to fulfill his mission and traveled to Europe by ship in May of this year to participate in the grand event. After the conference closed, Huang also visited various cities in Europe and the United States to inspect public utilities. At the beginning of this month, he boarded the Taiyo Maru in the United States and arrived in Japan, and then boarded the original ship to arrive in Shanghai at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Staff from the Bureau of Public Utilities, representatives from various business companies, and Huang's family members all went to the Wharf to welcome him. After Huang disembarked, he shook hands with each of the welcomers and returned to his private residence to rest. It is said that Huang's trip around the world lasted 150 days, and he still looks energetic. His report on the conference was sent to the bureau by mail after arriving in Japan, and the bureau is currently printing it for distribution to various agencies.</p>

<p>Fujian War Situation Currently in Northwest of Dehua</p>
<p>Ren Guangyu, Director of the Naval Compilation and Bereavement Office, who previously requested leave to return to his hometown, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM aboard the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Hua An" steamship. After disembarking at the Datong Wharf, he immediately took a car back to his residence on Rue Muling (now Moming Road). A reporter from the Guowen News Agency met Mr. Ren at the wharf and inquired about the recent situation in Fujian Province. He replied that there had been no intense warfare in Fujian recently. Fang Shengtao is currently commanding near Dehua, so the front line should be in the northwest of Dehua. Liu Heding's troops are stationed in the provincial capital. Special martial law was implemented in the city a few days ago, probably because there was deep fear of reactionary elements causing trouble. As for the Minister of the Navy, Yang Shuzhuang, he is currently residing in Fuzhou. I (Ren referring to himself) met Minister Yang at the provincial government, but this time I returned to my hometown to visit relatives, so although I paid my respects to Mr. Yang, there were no other tasks. When asked whether it was true that Lu Xingbang had sent troops through Shaowu and Chong'an to disturb Jiangxi and Zhejiang, Ren replied that Lu occupies Youxi and Yanping, taking advantage of the natural barriers. Now that troops are advancing to suppress him, even if Lu wanted to divide his forces to plot rebellion, he probably wouldn't have the strength. At that time, Ren was about to get into the car, so they parted ways.</p>

<p>Ma Gangyi, the former regimental commander under Zhou Fengqi, has been unemployed since Zhou was dismissed. Zhejiang Province issued a circular for his arrest on suspicion of being a reactionary. It was discovered that Ma was hiding in Room 41 of the Tongyi Hotel on Yunnan Road. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters learned of his involvement in the rebellion in Zhejiang and immediately informed the police. He was arrested at the hotel at around 10:00 AM. It is rumored that Tu Guilin, the former garrison commander of Ningtai, is also on the wanted list.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Overseas Chinese Federation Cables for Relief to Kunming Disaster-Stricken Overseas Chinese <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Overseas Chinese Federation of the Republic of China cabled the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of the Central Government, the Executive Yuan of the National Government, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Relief Committee, stating that the overseas Chinese residential area in Pontianak, the capital of the western region of Dutch Borneo, was completely destroyed by fire on the 10th of this month, with losses of approximately 4 million Dutch guilders, equivalent to over 6 million yuan in national currency. The overseas Chinese residing there are displaced. All newspapers have reported on this. It is noted that in March of the year before last, the Fujian Provincial Government provided 5,000 yuan in relief for the fire in Sibu Port, North Borneo, and the Fujian Relief Office allocated 3,000 yuan for relief. Although the amount was small, the overseas Chinese were grateful for the government's kindness and their hearts turned even more towards the motherland. This time, the number of disaster-stricken overseas Chinese in the Kunming fire is many times greater than in Sibu. The overseas Chinese in that port usually love the motherland and have spared no effort in aiding the Northern Expedition, donating to the Jinan Massacre, and various public welfare and charitable causes in the country. At this time of unexpected disaster, they must be eagerly awaiting assistance. It is earnestly requested that your committee take charge of telegraphing relief funds to be handed over to the local party headquarters and chamber of commerce for joint relief, in order to show the central government's concern for overseas Chinese in distant lands. This is respectfully reported. Respectfully, the Overseas Chinese Federation.</p>

<p>Sales as Usual Today, Sunday</p>
<p>The special district fair-price rice sales point organized by the Rice Market Adjustment Fair Price Committee (at the old site of the Tianhou Palace on North Henan Road) has seen extremely brisk sales of rice in recent days because it is inventory and has excellent inflation potential. The committee originally limited each person to buying no more than five dou (pecks), fearing that people would take turns buying in bulk. Personnel are dispatched daily to secretly investigate to avoid malpractices. Sales will continue as usual today, Sunday, without interruption.</p>

<p>Propaganda of Japanese Cocoons Transported to China as Excuse to Suppress Chinese Silk</p>
<p>Commodity Inspection Bureau Sends Letter to Lyon Silk Industry to Dispel Rumors</p>
<p>This year's silkworm cocoon harvest in our country has decreased. Some silk merchants are deeply concerned about insufficient supply. In order to meet the urgent needs, there is talk of transporting Japanese cocoons to China. In recent years, the Japanese silk industry has developed rapidly, and it is trying to suppress the production and sales of Chinese silk. Recently, Japanese merchants have taken advantage of the rumor of Japanese cocoons being transported to China to promote in France that China's silkworm cocoon production has suddenly decreased, and that Japan is supplying the raw materials, so it would be more beneficial to directly purchase Japanese silk. If this propaganda is not dispelled immediately, it will be a major blow to Chinese silk sales in France. In view of this, the Raw Silk Inspection Office of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, under the direction of Director Miao, specially sent a letter to the Lyon Silk Industry Association in France, stating that the transportation of Japanese cocoons to China is only a temporary expedient, and it has not yet become a reality. Please inform the industry not to be misled by Japanese rumors in order to maintain the commercial friendship between the two countries.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Domestically Produced Hydrochloric Acid and Caustic Soda Shipped <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Produced by Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant</p>
<p>Better Quality Than Foreign Goods</p>
<p>The Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant on Route Tenant de la Tour, sponsored by the Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, has had its machinery installed for a long time, but due to the problem of industrial salt, it has been hampered in every way. It only recently started production and shipping a few days ago. Its products, such as hydrochloric acid and caustic soda, are of sufficient grade and purity, and are highly praised by users. In addition, the bleaching powder has extremely strong bleaching power, surpassing its peers. The fresher the bleaching powder, the stronger its power. Since Japanese goods are closer to China, their power is stronger than Western goods. However, compared with the factory's local manufacturing, Japanese goods are no match. Currently, orders are pouring into the factory from as far south as Guangdong and as far north as Liaoning, and there is a shortage of supply. However, it is heard that the second batch of raw materials cannot be transported to Shanghai because the weighing and measuring bureau at the place of origin did not weigh and release them. It is feared that production will have to be stopped again. It is hoped that the government will support industry and release the goods for transportation as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Business Community Today Mourns Chen Qinxuan <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>In the Third Year of the Republic's Punitive Expedition Against Yuan</p>
<p>Saved Millions of Lives</p>
<p>Chen Qinxuan, a major figure in Shanghai's shipping industry and owner of the Yuanyi Steamship Company, whose courtesy name was Zhongshu, was from Zhenhai County, Zhejiang Province. He initially worked for the British-American Tobacco Company and was promoted to an important position. Later, he established his own Yuanyi Steamship Company with five ships sailing in the North and South Seas, and he pioneered the joint Shanghai-Liaoning-South Manchuria transportation of Chinese ships, which is still convenient for merchants and travelers today. However, during the decline of the shipping industry, Chen supported it for six or seven years. Due to poor business, the ships were all mortgaged and eventually closed down. Chen's efforts were also exhausted. He repeatedly tried to recover, but was always thwarted by the environment and unable to revive. Last autumn, he retired to recuperate and initially contracted hemoptysis. The illness deepened this spring and he died on August 6, at the age of 42, leaving behind six children, the eldest son being 15 and still in school, and the eldest daughter about to marry this winter. The family is impoverished. Shanghai business figures Yu Qiaqing, Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Wang Xiaolai, etc., believe that Chen not only contributed to the recovery of shipping rights but also made great contributions to the revolutionary cause. In the third year of the Republic, Chen Ying士 planned the punitive expedition against Yuan in Shanghai, ordering Niu Yongjian and Liu Fubiao to attack the Manufacturing Bureau on June 19 and fight with Zheng Rucheng. At that time, the party army failed due to lack of supplies. Zheng Rucheng sent an ultimatum from a German engineer in the factory to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, limiting the party army to withdraw within 24 hours, otherwise, artillery would be fired. At that time, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce was presided over by Mo Zijing, Li Pingshu, Zhu Shaosu, etc. After receiving the letter, they were greatly frightened because the lives and property of more than one million residents in southern Shanghai were at stake. They urgently replied to Zheng to stop the firing, but at that time, communication had been cut off and someone had to be sent to deliver the letter, but no one dared to enter the tiger's den. Chen was then serving as a staff officer and consultant to the Chamber of Commerce's punitive expedition against Yuan. Considering the safety of hundreds of thousands of people in the city, he resolutely stepped forward and borrowed a small boat from the British Navy to venture into the line of fire. After various dangers, he was detained by Zheng's troops several times and finally arrived at Zheng's headquarters. When Chen left, it was originally agreed that the time limit was one o'clock in the middle of the night. If he did not return by one o'clock, he would be killed. He did not return until two o'clock. Everyone thought he must have been killed by Zheng, but he succeeded in returning. Zheng Rucheng did not fire the artillery. Chen's sacrifice to enter the dangerous place to protect the safety of hundreds of thousands of residents in southern Shanghai was a great contribution. Niu Yongjian and others were personally involved in this matter. Now, Yu Wang Zhu and others have scheduled to mourn Chen today at the Customs Office in Nanshi and plan to state the facts of his merits and ask the National Government for a pension.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Qingyunli Demolition Dispute <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Requests the Municipal Council to Issue Licenses Carefully</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday regarding the Qingyunli demolition dispute, stating: "We hereby inform you that the houses in the Qingyunli area on North Sichuan Road, Chongming Road, are being demolished by the owner, Sassoon &amp; Co., under the pretext of renovation, using more than 200 White Russian workers, causing disturbances that resulted in injuries to three tenants. The merchants among the tenants have also suffered damage to their goods during the brick and tile chaos. Our association has recently received a report from the Guang Miscellaneous Goods Trade Association, whose members have suffered losses due to this case. They have attached photos and requested us to send a letter to the Municipal Council to handle it impartially. We have investigated that Sassoon &amp; Co. wants the tenants to move out and take back the houses for renovation. It should file a lawsuit in court to recover the houses in accordance with legal procedures, and it must not use such direct action to obstruct public order. Although the landlord's recovery of the houses is an exercise of its due rights, the exercise of rights has certain procedures and certain limits. If it does not resort to the law but directly resorts to force, it will not only cause unexpected losses to the other party but will also affect innocent third parties, which can lead to major disturbances at any time. This is not allowed in a country with a little legal order. It is true that there are many landlords in the Public Concession who want to recover their houses and proceed in accordance with the proper procedures, but it is also common to take direct action to demolish houses to force tenants to move out. This kind of despotic means of landlords is almost non-existent in the entire country except in the Public Concession. If there is such a thing, it is difficult to escape the punishment of the law. Now that such a major disturbance of destroying property and injuring people has occurred, our association believes that the Municipal Council should formulate appropriate regulations to prevent such direct actions in the future. When issuing demolition licenses, it must be verified that there are no disputes or that the eviction has been approved in accordance with legal procedures before issuing the license. Otherwise, the landlords will use the demolition license as a weapon to force tenants out. This should be paid attention to by the Municipal Council. Secondly, it is also a question of whether the landlord has applied for a demolition license. According to reports, the site has not been fenced off, which seems to prove that the license has not been obtained. If this is true, the Municipal Council should prosecute the landlord for violating the regulations of the Concession. Thirdly, the three tenants who were injured this time were found to have been injured by demolition workers. The Municipal Council should also instruct the police to file separate lawsuits with the court for punishment. As for the main point, it is necessary to formulate appropriate regulations for demolition licenses in the future and carefully examine and approve them so that landlords will not use their power to the fullest extent, which can reduce the medium of social disturbances. A letter is prepared for this purpose and returned, and you are requested to investigate and handle it accordingly. This is addressed to the Public Concession Municipal Council."</p>

<h3 id="e120">Female Opera Singer Mao Jianpei Dies Young <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Lover's Suspicion Was Unavoidable</p>
<p>Taking Poison to Prove Her Innocence Was Truly Lamentable</p>
<p>Alas, a Song of Love</p>
<p>Henceforth, the Face and Peach Blossoms</p>
<p>The pearl in the palm of famous actor Mao Yunke, Mao Jianpei, at the young age of twenty-three, was renowned for both her talent and beauty. She once appeared on the silver screen, earning the title of "Star," and her beauty became even more famous. She was deeply accomplished in Peking Opera, specializing in Qingyi and Huashan roles, and could perform many plays with great acclaim, no less than her father. Various Shanghai stages competed to hire her with high salaries, demonstrating her artistic talent. Ms. Mao was still unmarried, due to her father's exceptionally strict criteria for choosing a son-in-law. Last summer, she performed in Hankou, and this spring, she returned to Shanghai with honors, residing with her younger brother, Yanqiu (age twenty, specializing in Huashan roles), in a self-built mansion at No. 214, the corner of Xiafei Road and Songshan Road in the French Concession. They only employed a few servants for their needs, while their father, Yunke, resided separately in a villa on Guling Road. Suddenly, according to a friend's urgent report, Ms. Mao recently, due to a marriage issue, secretly ingested opium, resulting in her tragic death. Here is a record of public sentiment:</p>
<p>He Hou Scolds the Palace</p>
<p>Voice and Appearance Both Excellent</p>
<p>Mao Jianpei was born on the seventh day of the ninth lunar month, with the nickname Jiu'er, hence people referred to her as Miss Jiu. She was intelligent, lively, and exceptionally gifted. She initially joined China Film Company, playing a key role in the play "Face and Peach Blossoms."</p>
<p>Appearing on the silver screen was just right, but her father, Yunke, strongly disapproved of his beloved daughter's involvement in film and was very determined to prevent it. He urged her to study Peking Opera. Jianpei was exceptionally clever and soon mastered the essence of Qingyi. Her father, Yunke, wanting his daughter to further her studies, sent Jianpei north the year before last to become a disciple of Wang Yaoqing. Under the guidance of a famous teacher, her skills improved rapidly. Upon returning to Shanghai, she accepted an engagement from the Danggui First Stage and began her stage life. Her first performance was "He Hou Scolds the Palace," and her excellent voice and appearance were greatly appreciated by the audience. After the Danggui ceased performances, she went to Hankou.</p>
<p>Shanghai Residents Look Forward To</p>
<p>New Autumn Performance</p>
<p>This past March, Jianpei returned from Hankou and resided at No. 214 Xiafei Road, living a secluded life, using acting as a pastime. In the summer, the owner of the Sanxing Stage persuaded Mao Yunke to have his beloved daughter perform at the beginning of autumn to satisfy Shanghai's admiration for Miss Jiu's voice and appearance. Mao agreed and made a contract, choosing the 28th of this month to take the stage. The week before last, her father invited friends and companions to visit Jianpei and introduce her to the public. Every night, he also supervised his daughter's vocal practice at his residence on Guling Road to prepare.</p>
<p>Hankou Lovers</p>
<p>Agreed to Marry</p>
<p>Mao Jianpei's sudden death is indeed abrupt. Just three days ago, someone encountered her at her residence on Guling Road. According to the reporter's investigation from various sources, her death is indeed confirmed. However, the cause of death has slight discrepancies in the rumors. Here is a description of what has been heard and is reliable: Mao Jianpei's death was a suicide, and the main reason involved a marriage issue. It is said that a Mr. Hu met Jianpei during a trip to Hankou and fell in love, agreeing to marry each other. However, Jianpei was very filial to her father and did not want to make decisions about marriage on her own. She once said to Mr. Hu, "I am currently twenty-three years old. The matter of marriage should wait two more years before it can be held because my father has spent a lot of money and energy on my acting training. I should try to repay him a little to comfort my father." Her intention was that in these two years, she would use her performance income to support her father.</p>
<p>Buying a Car for Transportation</p>
<p>Caused a Major Uproar</p>
<p>Mr. Hu also came to Shanghai with Jianpei on this trip, and the two were very close. Recently, Mr. Hu wanted to buy a car for transportation and entrusted Jianpei to choose and buy it. Mao had a female friend, Mrs. Min, whose husband knew car dealers, so she transferred the request to contact the car dealership. However, Hu thought Mao's car purchase was not straightforward and went directly to the car dealership, entrusting Mr. Min instead. He felt very unhappy in his heart and suspected that Min was also young and seemed quite familiar with Mao, creating clouds of suspicion. His words often revealed displeasure. Mao knew his intention and went to Min's place to cancel the car purchase the next day. Who knew that Mr. Hu would go to Mao's residence at this time and, finding her absent, inquired and learned that she had gone to Min's place, leading to a misunderstanding and a major uproar.</p>
<p>Taking Poison to Prove Her Innocence</p>
<p>Tragic Death</p>
<p>That night, the two met and had a big argument. Mao Jianpei had always been ambitious and proud. In a moment of anger, she conceived the idea of suicide and secretly swallowed a large amount of opium. Her father noticed that she was already poisoned and immediately hired a car to send her to the hospital for treatment, but it was impossible to save her, resulting in her tragic death. The above is from reliable sources. However, although the reporter has no doubt that Mao Jianpei committed suicide, whether there are other details is unknown to outsiders. For the sake of caution, the reporter visited her father, Mao Yunke, at his residence on Guling Road.</p>
<p>Heartache and Tears</p>
<p>Old Father's Sorrow</p>
<p>The reporter arrived at Mao's residence on Guling Road and presented his card. Jianpei's father, Yunke, came out to see him, with worry visible between his eyebrows and tears welling up in the corners of his eyes, as if telling people about the grief and pain of his beloved daughter's death. The reporter asked about Jianpei's death, and Mao nodded repeatedly, sighing incessantly, saying, "My little girl was originally going to make her debut, who knew such a thing would happen, alas!" The reporter asked, "What disease did your beloved suffer from that caused her death?" Mao paused slightly, his face showing sadness, and said, "She suffered from a very serious liver and stomach problem and died from it." The reporter further inquired about the exact time of Jianpei's death. Mao Yunke claimed that his mind was confused and he could not remember. He turned to his third daughter and said, "When did your sister die, do you know?" His daughter said tearfully, "It was at seven o'clock last night."</p>
<p>A Song of Love</p>
<p>Then Departed from the World</p>
<p>At this point in the conversation, Mao Jianpei's art friend, Brother Guo, entered the room and, seeing the reporter, sighed with regret and spoke of the dying state of Miss Jiu, which was heartbreaking. After Mao Jianpei took poison, she was sent to Shanghai Nursing Home on Luo Biegen Road. By the evening of the 12th, around 7 p.m., her condition suddenly changed. However, a final glow appeared, and a faint blush appeared on her jade-like face. At this time, dusk had arrived, and the setting sun had just receded. The lights had just come on, and a pale yellow halo appeared in the sky. The sickroom became even quieter. Suddenly, a sharp singing voice was heard from Mao Jianpei's bedside, mournful and beautiful, unbearable to hear. Many Westerners in the nursing home were recuperating, and they leaned their ears to listen and couldn't help but get up and inquire, knowing that it was the mournful song of a Chinese girl on her deathbed. They all shed tears of sadness. It turned out that Jianpei's song was a song from the "Extravagant History of the Xuan Palace." The song was "Dream Lover." Almost as soon as she finished singing, the protagonist of "Face and Peach Blossoms" passed away forever.

<h3 id="e121">Robbery of Huge Sum of Money in the Early Morning <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Two Bags of Banknotes, Over Eight Thousand Dollars</p>
<p>Robbers Fired Shots as a Warning After the Robbery</p>
<p>At Bao Da Xiang Foreign Goods General Store, located at No. 90 to No. 100, the corner of Tongyun Street and Xiaodongmen Main Street in the French Concession, yesterday morning at around 8 a.m., the old clerks Lin Chusheng (26 years old) and Zhang Axiang (40 years old, both from Ningbo) were ordered to deliver banknotes worth 8,312 yuan and a paper of 40 liang of silver drafts. The cash was divided into two bags, with Lin and Zhang each carrying one bag, intending to deliver them to the Hongcheng Money Exchange on Ningbo Road. Unexpectedly, while passing the Zuibaoyuan Hotel on Tongyun Street, four robbers suddenly appeared. Two robbers held guns against Lin and Zhang's chests, threatening them to keep silent. They took all the banknotes in the two bags. At that time, a Bao Da Xiang apprentice, Gu Zhongfang, was out buying glutinous rice cakes and caught a glimpse of the scene. He immediately blew the whistle, and the robbers turned around and fired two shots as a warning. At that time, Shi Ziyun (28 years old), a local worker from the Jinxin Laundry Shop, which was next to Zuibaoyuan, went out to get an iron. A bullet flew and grazed his right leg, fortunately without serious injury. The robbers carried the stolen goods, escaped through the back door of the Yuebin Hotel, exited from the front door, and fled to the Chinese Concession, where they disappeared. The two old clerks, Lin and Zhang, returned to the store and reported to the Xiaodongmen Police Station, requesting an investigation. They also stopped payment of the drafts at the money exchange.</p>

<p>In the case of the robbery of 100,000 yuan in banknotes from the Zhejiang Provincial Bank, the Laozha Police Station Detective You A Gen has arrested several robbers in the Chinese and foreign concessions. The military police in Tianjin have also intercepted Zhu Dexin, the main culprit who fired shots during the robbery. Personnel have already been dispatched to Tianjin to bring him back. After the police station obtained the names of the four main robbers from the arrested thief He Guo, they immediately telegraphed major ports and commercial cities, ordering strict investigation of incoming ships and trains. Now that Zhu Dexin has been arrested in Tianjin, the other three robbers are expected to have fled far away. Yesterday, it was reported that the Hong Kong authorities also arrested a robber in this case when a ship from Shanghai arrived in Hong Kong. The police station has now sent a telegram to inquire. Once the Hong Kong side replies and confirms the report, detectives will be selected and sent to Hong Kong to bring him back.</p>

<p>False Letter of Appointment Seized</p>
<p>All Sentenced to the Headquarters</p>
<p>Yongkang County, Zhejiang Province, has been repeatedly ravaged by bandits this year. Residents have been killed and occupied villages and towns have been almost completely devastated. Recently, the provincial government dispatched security teams to suppress the remnants of the bandits, who then fled. The leader has already been ordered by the county to be apprehended. According to intelligence from the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters detectives Wang Bin, Yang Fengqi, Xu Pengfei, etc., the gang of notorious bandits from Jinhua, namely Lü Sitang, Zhang Jiashui (also known as Chen Wenmo), Wang Qi, Jiang Guoxiang, and Chen Yiwen, have all fled to Shanghai and are hiding in Room 48 of the Unified Hotel on Beihai Road in the Public Concession. They reported to the Laozha Police Station the day before yesterday, who, together with detectives Wang Shusheng, Zhao Gengsheng, and Western detectives, went to the hotel. All five bandits were in the room and were arrested together and taken back to the police station for questioning. It was learned that bandit Lü also had another residence at No. 2 Sanrui Lane, Lafayette Road in the French Concession. They cooperated with French police detectives and went to the address, where they found a letter of appointment from Zhou Fengqi, the former commander of the 26th Army. The false position appointed was "Deputy Captain of the Fourth Detachment of the First Brigade of the Second Route Mobile Army of the Republic of China Army," while the same person also signed in the name of the Brigade Commander. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Special District Local Court, where Presiding Judge Xu Jiashi reviewed the case and clearly ordered that Lü Sitang and the other four be taken by the detectives of the Headquarters to be investigated.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Zhang Taijie's Appeal Case <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Tried Yesterday at the Jiangsu High Court</p>
<p>Dong Yu and Four Others Did Not Attend</p>
<p>The case of Zhang Taijie, general manager of the Sichuan-Hankou Railway, being accused by Zeng Xianzhi of embezzling more than 3 million taels of huge sums of money, appealed to the High Court after being dissatisfied with the verdict of the Shanghai Local Court. On the 21st of last month, Criminal Division Chief Lin Dawen opened an investigation court to summon Zhang Taijie and Zeng Xianzhi, Dong Yu, Ao Enzhan, and others to inquire about the details, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday (13th), High Court Chief Lin continued to open the court. Those summoned included Dong Yu, Li Shirui, Cheng Zhongfan, Ao Enzhan, Wu Jingming, and five others. All failed to report due to other matters, so only Zhang Taijie was summoned for questioning. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Case History: On June 25th of the lunar calendar in 1929, Zhang Taijie, Chen Shujia, Liu Yajue, Wu Jingming, and others established the Sichuan-Hankou Railway Resident Office in Shanghai. They mortgaged the Hankou Shanghai land to Ao Enzhan for 5,000 yuan, with Ao first paying 2,500 yuan to cover the opening expenses. However, after obtaining the funds, Zhang used all of them. Subsequently, he sent someone to Cheng Xuelou to request the return of the previous loan road deed. Cheng's son, Zhongfan, handed it over, and Zhang immediately mortgaged it to lawyer Li Shirui for 20,000 yuan. He used this money to repay Ao Enzhan's loan (2,500 yuan) and to reward those who contributed and pay the lawyer Dong Yu's signature fee. The remaining funds were embezzled by Zhang Taijie. Later, Zeng Xianzhi came forward to report it. The Shanghai Local Court sentenced Zhang to three years of imprisonment, while lawyer Dong Yu was declared innocent.</p>
<p>Court Hearing: Yesterday afternoon at around 2 p.m., Chief Lin Dawen brought Zhang Taijie to court and informed him that today's investigation court was still open because Dong Yu and Li Shirui had not attended. Although Dong Yu had been found not guilty, the outcome of the appeal trial was also unknown. In other words, Dong was still an appellant in this case and not a witness. Lawyer Li Shirui was an important witness in this case. After the announcement, he (asked) Zhang when.</p>

<p>Fang Pingyi Fully Confesses</p>
<p>Nearly Twenty Times in Total</p>
<p>Yu Maolong, a detective from the First District Police Station in the South City, recently discovered that Fang Zhen, alias Pingyi, a Ningbo native who habitually wrote threatening letters to extort money in the South City area, was hiding in the pavilion room at No. 3 Zaihua Lane, Xiaoximen. The night before last, he led a group of detectives to the Second Branch of the Second District Police Station, requesting the dispatch of police officers and detective Yuan Haishan and others, a total of more than ten people, to quietly surround the front and rear doors of Zaihua Lane. Detectives Yu and Yuan entered and arrested Fang Pingyi, the extortionist, and delivered him to the police station yesterday for interrogation. According to the confession of the extortionist, he is 17 years old, from Zhenhai. He came to Shanghai in the first month of the lunar calendar last year. He currently has no business. He used to live at the Xiaojiu Hua Fukang Candy Store and worked at the racetrack before moving to the pavilion room at No. 3 Zaihua Lane, Xiaoximen, in February this year, where he slept on the floor. The monthly rent of four yuan was paid by pawning clothes. Now, due to a lack of resources, he wrote threatening letters. The first time was in April, writing to Chen Longlian in Bai Zha Lane three or four times without success. He also sent someone to speak to him. The second time was in May, writing to Jiang Baokang in Huangjia Que, Xiaoximen, three times without success. He heard that someone was coming to arrest him. The third time was to Zhang Yingcai at No. 122 Nancang Street in June, but only wrote one letter. Someone came to arrest him, but it was also unsuccessful.

The eighth time was writing to Dr. Tan Ganchen, writing two letters, but it was also ineffective. The ninth time was writing to the Peng family at the New Wharf, writing twice, but as a result, they sent someone to arrest him. His relatives run the Huiwen Tang Bookstore on Qipan Street and is his maternal uncle. Also, Xu Fu at No. 25 Deqing Lane, Tongfu Lane, Julaida Road in the French Concession is his maternal uncle. They can be inquired. He did not move any silver dollars, but at the beginning of last month, he wrote a letter to Chen Budan at No. 102 Anlan Road and received 20 silver dollars. He went to collect it at 6 PM, and only saw a child, not an adult, etc. It is reported that the case is currently summoning the victims to the police station to testify before being sent to the General Bureau for transfer to the court for trial.</p>

<p>Third National Products Movement Week Decided to Be Held at the Store</p>
<p>The China National Products United Department Store was originally scheduled to operate on a trial basis for one month. After discussions among various manufacturers, it was decided to continue for another month. Now that the two-month period has expired, Zhang Zilian, the founder of the store, has decided to extend the operation in order to promote national products for a long time. Yesterday, he specially invited like-minded colleagues who are enthusiastic about national products, such as Chen Xiangyuan, Shen Shuyu, Wang Hanqiang, Pan Dechun, Cui Fujiang, and others, to discuss reorganization plans. Mr. Zhang reported the proposed articles of association and drawings after the reorganization. The public unanimously agreed and changed the location fee to a minimum of only forty yuan per month, and canceled the three types of advertising expenses, planning each industry sector in order to improve it. Regarding the organizational aspect, it was decided to reorganize into a limited company or a limited partnership company. The founders and supporters will jointly initiate fundraising. In addition to renting the department store location, the national products business will also be operated. In addition, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau believes that the location is central and the transportation is convenient, and has decided to hold the exhibition and amusement events of the current National Products Movement Week in the department store. Dong Ke Ren, from the National Products Exhibition Hall, was sent to negotiate yesterday, and the result was very satisfactory.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Public Notice by the Municipal Public Security Bureau Regarding Rent Arrears <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau Public Notice Zheng Zi No. 25: This city is an important commercial port in the country, with Chinese and foreigners living together, and attracting attention from both domestic and foreign quarters. In order to promote the development of the entire city, it is necessary to attract merchants and residents so as to gather people from all directions and achieve prosperity day by day. The first step is to build more city houses and residences so as to fully accommodate them as the only fundamental plan. Recently, it has been found that the construction in the concession is becoming newer and more prosperous every day, with almost no vacant land, while the city is sparsely populated and progress has been slow in recent years. Tracing the cause, it is the concession tenants who are accustomed to being lazy and rely on arrears of rent as a common occurrence, often delaying payment for months or years. As the arrears accumulate, they become increasingly unable to pay, and in the end, they can only resort to the law or reluctantly settle by vacating and returning the house. Landlords have no interest to account for on time, and there are complicated lawsuits, so adding one business increases one burden. Therefore, powerful families are unwilling to invest in construction, and the completed houses are not repaired in time and gradually become dilapidated. If this continues, not only will future construction be impossible, but the existing city will also gradually decline. If active measures are not taken to remedy this situation, the future of the city will be greatly hindered. It is found that rights and obligations should be equal. Landlords buy land and build houses and manage laboriously. Tenants enjoy the right to reside in an existing house and should bear the obligation to pay rent on time. People who rent houses also have their own occupations, either shop owners or laborers. If goods are taken without payment or labor is not compensated, how can this be justified? Landlords are also operating a business, so how can they invest in property without any reasonable return? This bureau is responsible for maintaining public safety, and all threats to public order must be prevented in advance. Regarding the matter of rent arrears, the Municipal Government has recently issued an order to ban it, and it should be handled in earnest according to the powers. In addition to issuing an order to subordinates to comply, this notice is issued for public knowledge. If any arbitrary rent arrears are found in the future, the owner will immediately report the case and strictly ban it without any leniency. All residents of this territory must comply. This notice is issued on the thirteenth day of the ninth month of the nineteenth year of the Republic of China. Director Yuan Liang.</p>

<p>The Municipal Council yesterday sent separate letters to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the Special District Local Court, requesting that they forward the following three points to the Supreme Court for clear interpretation so as to follow them: (1) If a judge from the High Court Branch hears a case alone, does this judge have the right to make a decision on the case being heard? (2) Do the High Court Branch and the Special District Court have jurisdiction over the post office? (3) Does the secret order issued by the National Government that all Communist cases be accepted by military organs conflict with the agreement established by the returned court? It is reported that the two presidents, Xu and Yang, have forwarded the request to the Nanjing Supreme Court after receiving the letter from the bureau, and have also requested instructions to comply with them. According to the Municipal Council, the above three points are all recent facts.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Three Cases Arising from Opium <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Divorce... Insulting Elders... Smoking</p>
<p>Tang Zuyao, a villager from the Third Map of the 29th Bao of Hongqiao Road, West Shanghai, is addicted to opium. His wife, Gu, advised him to quit, but he became irreconcilable with his wife. He filed a divorce suit against his wife in the local court, but it was rejected. Not long after Tang read the verdict, he requested another divorce, so the case is still pending. Gu, being a traditional woman, did not want a divorce and cried to Tang's paternal uncle, Tang Heting, asking him to help reconcile. Tang Heting repeatedly tried to persuade Zuyao, but Zuyao refused. Heting could not help but scold him, but he was beaten by Zuyao. After Heting was injured, he went to the local court to report that Zuyao should not beat and insult his elders. After the prosecutor verified the injury, he issued an arrest warrant the day before yesterday, and the bailiff went to arrest him. Zuyao was still indulging in opium, so his smoking paraphernalia was also seized by the bailiff. Together with Tang Zuyao's arrest, the preliminary trial order was issued to detain him pending punishment, so the matter that started with opium ended with opium, suddenly turning into three cases.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Negotiations Over Workers Beating Police <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Trouble Started from Gambling</p>
<p>At the Sixth District, Second Branch of the Shanghai West Xujiahui Town Municipal Public Security Bureau, at around 8 PM the night before last (12th), Patrol Officer Xu Guifang of the Jinji Bridge Police Station reported that Zhu Zizhen and Zeng Yunzhong, workers from the Yougeng Taihe Joint Flour Factory, and Wu Guisheng, a worker from the Dachina Rubber Factory, had a quarrel in Taiyuan Lane in the French Concession due to gambling, resulting in a fight. Zeng and Zhu were no match and fled into the Chinese territory, but Wu Guisheng refused to give up and gathered six or seventy workers from the same factory, creating a menacing scene. They then chased after them to the south end of Jinji Bridge (which belongs to Chinese territory). Patrol Chief Wang Dazhao and Police Officer Xie Yongzhang saw this and, fearing trouble, stepped forward to stop them. However, the workers ignored the warnings and dragged Patrol Chief Wang and Police Officer Xie into the French Concession north of the creek, surrounded and beat them. He requested the dispatch of police to rescue them. After receiving the report, Director Liu, together with Patrol Officer Yuan Gancheng and Patrol Chief Shi Hegen, led the police to suppress the situation. Upon arrival, they found that the French Concession police had dispatched detectives and arrested seven rubber factory workers, including Wu Guisheng, while the rest fled. Wang and Xie were also taken back to the police station and sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. They were discharged after bandaging because their injuries were not serious. Director Liu returned to the station and prepared a letter to the police station, personally going to welcome and retrieve the head of the arrest. Because the case had been reported to the General Patrol Room Detective Division, he had to wait until 9 AM tomorrow (i.e., the 13th) to welcome and retrieve them from the Lujiazui Police Station. Director Liu repeatedly negotiated with him but did not get any results. He had to bring Wang and Xie back to the police station. Yesterday morning, Director Liu went to the Lujiazui Police Station with Patrol Officer Yuan to welcome and retrieve the murderers Wu Guisheng and others. After Director Liu repeatedly negotiated with the police station, five people were handed over only at around 1 PM (one of them was released by the detective, and Jiang Zhongying's leg was injured and treated in the hospital). Director Liu brought them back to the station and conducted a strict interrogation. According to Wu Guisheng, 30 years old, Yu Changfu, 27 years old, Zhang Jinyang, 25 years old, Shen Baosheng, 19 years old, and Zhang Xinfu, 16 years old, all workers in the factory, they went out to see what was happening and were mistakenly arrested. They firmly denied beating the patrol chief. Wang Patrol Chief and Xie Police Officer were summoned for questioning. They claimed that a total of seven people were arrested at the time, brought back to Fuxing Road by detective Hong Debao of the Shanzhong Road Police Station, and one person was released by Detective Hong. They also pointed out that the arrested criminals were indeed the perpetrators at the scene and presented the torn uniforms, military caps, and weapons for inspection. After Director Liu's confession, he immediately dispatched police to arrest Zhu Zizhen and Zeng Yunzhong, workers from the Gengtai Factory, who were the real instigators of the case. The workers dared to gather and beat the patrol chief, which was a blatant disregard for the law. He prepared a document to send all the criminals to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for strict legal action. Detective Hong Debao privately released criminals halfway through, and a serious negotiation should be made with the police station.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Strike by Workers at Old British-American Tobacco Factory Tin Packaging Department <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The British-American Tobacco Factory Union in Pudong reported that the factory had dismissed Bao Yangzhou, a worker in the old factory's tin packaging department, without reason, causing dissatisfaction among the workers in the department, who went on strike in solidarity. After several ineffective negotiations, a general meeting of all representatives from the old and new factories was specially convened yesterday afternoon. Chen Peide was elected chairman and reported on the strike in the department. The following items were discussed: (1) What should be done regarding Bao Yangzhou's dismissal after several ineffective negotiations? It was decided that if the negotiations were not resolved by next Monday, the cigarette workers in the new factory would go on strike for half an hour at 9:00 AM next Tuesday to urge the factory to realize its mistake. (2) It was decided to ask the superiors to negotiate at the same time next week regarding the dismissal of three female workers in the old factory without reason. (3) It was decided to refer the case of the new factory's use of "wild chicken" (unskilled) workers in the leaf department to the Standing Committee for discussion. The meeting was adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Industrial Unions Must Not Suspend Activities of Various Labor Unions <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Circular from the Citizens Training Committee</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department's Mass Training Committee recently received a report from the Preparatory Committee of the Yarn Factory Industry Labor Union Federation stating that the East Asia Hemp Bag Factory Labor Union had been preparing for several months without any performance, leading to an order to suspend activities and dispatch personnel to investigate. The report requested filing with the committee. The committee, after receiving the report, believed that the Preparatory Committee of the Yarn Factory Industry Labor Union Federation was responsible for guiding the various labor unions in the industry and had no authority to arbitrarily suspend the activities of any labor union, let alone deal with a labor union in the industry. The nature of the East Asia Hemp Bag Factory Labor Union had nothing to do with the yarn factory industry. Therefore, it was ordered to suspend the activities of the labor union, which was a transgression of authority and disruption of the system. Therefore, yesterday, the committee instructed the Yarn Factory Industry Labor Union Federation Preparatory Committee to severely criticize and instruct the instructor, Xu Shaochuan, to provide careful guidance in the future and not to allow similar illegal and unauthorized incidents to occur again. At the same time, the committee instructed the East Asia Hemp Bag Factory Labor Union to continue preparing as usual and not to suspend activities. At the same time, in order to prevent other industrial unions from engaging in similar unauthorized actions, a circular was issued to all industry labor union preparatory committees to comply. In the future, all must adhere to their respective powers and strive to prepare without engaging in the aforementioned behavior that would lead to unauthorized and illegal charges.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Recent Tragic Locust Plague in Wugong County <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The China Relief Society received a telegram from Ma Ri, acting on behalf of the Wugong County Relief Branch in Shaanxi, stating that the disasters in Wugong County over the years have been unprecedented and known far and wide. This year, since mid-summer, there has been a severe drought, and the rice seedlings have withered, making the autumn harvest hopeless. In the middle of last month, a large-scale locust plague broke out. At first, they only ate the leaves and branches, but then they ate the stems and ears. The seedlings are almost completely eaten, and the number of locusts is increasing without decreasing. When locusts eat rice, they hold on with their six feet, spread their four wings, and connect with each other. From a distance, the wings shine brightly like pieces of glass, boundless. Ten acres of rice can be eaten in an instant. Old and weak women and children hold poles to drive them away, weeping in the fields. The largest locusts are about eight inches long and two inches in diameter, with colors ranging from red, yellow, green, brown, and black. Their shapes are strange and frightening. They cannot be driven away, and they move like an ant colony, flying into the rice like a hurricane and rain. Human power cannot save them. It has rained twice in recent days, but the drought is too severe, so only wheat can be sown, but the locusts have not subsided. As soon as the wheat sprouts, it is eaten by the locusts. There is no harvest of early, middle, or late rice. Even the leaves of wild vegetables have been eaten. The lives of the remaining people have reached the point of desperation. The atmosphere is tragic, and the sight is unbearable. The association regards hunger and drowning as a concern and has paid special attention to the great disaster in Wuyi. It has provided two rounds of relief in the autumn of last year and this summer, and has established three disaster children shelters, saving countless lives. The merits are immeasurable, and everyone praises them. Now the locust plague is even more severe, and the human race is about to perish. Pictures of the disaster are attached, begging for rescue to complete the rescue and thorough relief effort. The people of Wu will be grateful forever. It is impossible to be urgent. The association has provided relief funds to many counties in Shaanxi in the past two years, and it has paid special attention to the relief in Wugong, using more than 100,000 yuan for emergency relief, spring relief, and seed grain. The association has also established three shelters in the disaster-stricken county, with monthly expenses of about 2,000 yuan, which are still in progress. According to reports, the locust plague will soon turn into winter relief, and it is difficult to raise relief funds if it is to be done, but the disaster victims will perish if it is not done. The association is at its wit's end and is extremely anxious, hoping that fellow countrymen at home and abroad will work together to do their best to save the situation.</p>

<p>At 9:30 PM last night, at the home of Qian Futang, a resident of a bungalow on Avenue See Ah Sams, Route Cardinal Foch, Route Petain in the French New Concession, four robbers suddenly arrived. They displayed handguns to intimidate and silence him. They ransacked the house, taking gold jewelry, clothing, and silver dollars totaling about 140 yuan. Carrying the stolen goods, they rushed out of the door and fled in different directions. Qian's family chased after them from the back room, and nearby detectives gathered upon hearing the alarm. They chased them all the way to near Dapu Bridge and intercepted one robber, immediately taking him to the police station for strict interrogation. The robber confessed his name as Wang Shengfu and admitted that he had organized the robbery. The head of the arrest ordered him to be held in custody pending the arrest of his accomplices for strict punishment.</p>

<p>The property at No. 1 and No. 2 Yinghua Lane, Zhengjia Muqiao Street, is part of the estate of the late Zhu Youhong, a former Qing Dynasty transport envoy. Recently, his eighth son intends to take back the management of the two lanes. However, the lessee argues that in 1925, there was a lawsuit involving rent increases that lasted for two years before it was concluded, and less than two years have passed since then. The losses have not yet been recovered, so he is demanding to continue the lease for five years to compensate. Although many efforts have been made by famous lawyers and relatives and friends to mediate, the two parties are at extremes and will involve the leasing matter in litigation in public court.</p>

<p>— Autumn Water</p>
<p>The person who laughs the loudest is often not the happiest person.</p>
<p>To shut up, you must first have an open heart.</p>
<p>A man is like a piece of clay in a woman's hand, which can be made round or flat.</p>
<p>Bad habits are like seaweed. If you cannot remove their roots, they will grow more and more each day.</p>
<p>A person who cannot believe in himself can never believe in others.</p>
<p>A married woman can never tell you what her husband said when he proposed, because she has already won and has forgotten the past.</p>
<p>In the past, young women spent all their energy trying to make men inclined to marriage, but modern young women are using their magic to drag men out of marriage.</p>
<p>Love and marriage are purely two different things. Whether a man or a woman has experienced these two things, he or she can never gain any benefit.</p>
<p>People are only a silent gourd to each other. If you can see through the hearts of so-called big shots, you will kill them.</p>
<p>Happy things can never be prolonged. Prolonged happiness is the most distressing thing in the world.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as "lost love" in the world, because true love will never be lost. Lost love is never true love.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Battlefield Strange News <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yangzhou</p>
<p>A friend of mine followed the camp as a German aide-de-camp translator. He returned home yesterday to visit his relatives and talked about many anecdotes from the battlefield that were not recorded in the newspapers. They are presented as true free talk, perhaps for the people in the South to hear.</p>
<p>My friend said that the Central Army and the Northwest Army were confronting each other in Lanfeng and Tushan for several months. The advances and retreats have caused countless casualties among the people, but there has been no progress. Lanfeng has always been known as a natural barrier, a screen for Zheng and Luo. Therefore, Feng's army relied on the perilous terrain to defend to the death. It is estimated that there are seven lines of defense, planned by Russian military officers. The strength of its defense is no less than Nankou. After the Central Army captured Guide, the commander-in-chief stationed in Liuhe, General Jiang, consulted the German aide-de-camp. The German advised Chiang Kai-shek not to attack the main force of Feng's army, as it would be difficult to achieve great success and only waste real strength. He instructed his subordinates to work hard to attack, and the brave and skilled Central Army broke through five lines of defense. However, due to the strong defenses, landmines, and artillery fire, the remaining two lines were difficult to cross. According to the German, this method was originally created by General Hindenburg. The Russians can build seven lines of defense, and the Germans can build nine. The frontal defense cannot be broken by any sacrifice. It is necessary to use artillery fire to suppress the front and attack both sides with flanking forces to be effective. However, this requires several times the strength of the enemy army to be successful. This shows that the precision and effectiveness of Western firearms in attack and defense are truly astonishing. Recalling our country, I cannot help but shudder.</p>
<p>The Central Army treats the enemy equally, regardless of their origins. However, the cruelty of Feng's army towards the enemy is beyond imagination. It is said that if a Central Army soldier is wounded on the front line and cannot be carried back, Feng orders his subordinates to behead him and leave his body on the battlefield, or to kill him if he has lost his ability to resist. Feng smiled and said that this would be enough to intimidate the opponent's soldiers. This statement from a Feng's army prisoner is said to be reliable.</p>
<p>The daredevil corps of Feng's army are brave and unstoppable. It is said that they often come at night, waving a large flag with one hand, the sound of the wind enough to repel bullets. With the other hand, they hold a broadsword, rolling on the ground and rushing forward. A slight carelessness allows them to break through the line of fire. Moreover, they are hidden in the tall sorghum and wheat fields in the summer, making them even more difficult to defend against. Even with firearms, it is difficult to hit them. Feng's army relies on this as a weapon for attacks. A martial arts expert from Zhejiang, Li, suggested to the headquarters that the "Seven Killing Spear" is the only good method to defeat the broadsword corps. The method is very simple, requiring only seven hands to break the sword. It is unknown whether it will be adopted.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Strange Tales of Dream Plum <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Mingyang</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read in "Free Talk" that Mr. Wang Meiju said that there are women in Hangzhou with flower-like patterns, which can be called a strange appearance. But I have heard my friend, the famous painter Ma Qizhou from Shanghai, say that his daughter also has an extraordinary quality. She has a plum blossom on her chest, which can be said to be unique. Therefore, I write this down to add to "Free Talk."</p>
<p>Mr. Ma is a famous scholar from Sichuan. His wife became pregnant before the end of the Xuantong era. On the eve of her delivery, his mother-in-law dreamed of a brocade robe covered with plum blossoms painted by Mr. Ma. She wanted to blame him, but Grandpa Baozhen said it was a wonderful embellishment. The next afternoon, his wife gave birth to a daughter with a cinnabar dot on her chest. After a month, when she was bathed, it was clearly a five-petaled red plum blossom. The stamens of the flower were complete, with the upper half of the moon colored like rouge and the lower half colored like cinnabar. It can be said to be extraordinary. Therefore, she was named Luomei. Also, when this girl was still in swaddling clothes and not yet able to speak clearly, if someone asked about the flower, she would point to her chest. As she grew older, she became intelligent and handsome. She learned to read and never forgot what she had seen. Therefore, the whole family loved her dearly. She is now married to the Jin family. Such a natural anomaly, confirmed in a dream, is truly a strange thing (paid).</p>
<h3 id="e153">Record of Talking About Tigers Turns Pale <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Yuanqi</p>
<p>Zhang Ze, courtesy name Shanzai, is from Neijiang, Sichuan. He is skilled in Zheng Qian's three perfections. He once raised a tiger. The tiger was greedy and Zhang Ze fed it large pieces of fat pork every day. After it was full, he released its iron rope and let it into the deep ravine. Soon, wind would rise as if it were angry or drunk, and it would roar and dance in the valleys, creating unusual sights. When it was hungry, he would put fat pork in a cage, and the tiger would wag its tail and approach it, as if respecting its master. Throughout history, many tiger painters have resembled dogs. Nature painters can only convey the outward appearance of the tiger and cannot capture its true nature. Only Zhang Ze, who has raised tigers for many years, is proficient in painting tigers and is therefore nicknamed the "Tiger Obsessed." One day, Zhang Ze invited messengers to his residence, Da Feng Studio, and showed them a book. He saw that it was titled "Twelve Beauties of Jinling" by Zeng Nongran. The messenger said to Zhang Ze, "You have never liked to create beautiful works of the boudoir. Are you now also imitating the appearance of children?" Zhang Ze said, "Tiger ears." The messenger was greatly shocked and turned pale. Looking at it, it was indeed twelve tigers. Some were crouching, some were standing, some were drinking thirstily, some were angry, and some were charming, showing extreme variations. The inscriptions were filled with romantic words, all with imaginative ideas. On the walls were paintings of tigers, some as large as ten feet and some as small as several feet, with claws dancing and teeth bared, and groups of tigers fighting for food, seemingly symbolizing the worthy officials in power. There were those who hid their heads and showed their tails, wearing tiger skins, symbolizing the even more worthy among the worthy officials in power. The inscription on a painting of a crouching tiger read, "When the fierce tiger is mentioned, those who hear it turn pale." I have heard that fierce tigers lie in deep mountains, but now fierce tigers are in the public eye. Alas, the road is difficult. Are you good at satirizing the world?" Zhang Ze heard this and smiled. Wang Yiting, the man from Bailong Mountain, once painted a portrait of Zhang Ze with a tangled beard flying, his form resembling a tiger, and inscribed it with the words, "Knowing that you are accustomed to conveying the spirit of the tiger, painting the appearance of the tiger as if it were your own body, born with a tiger's beard and a majestic appearance, depicting the tiger's power with all your spirit." Zhang Ze's majestic appearance is indeed like that of a mountain lord. Zhang Ze once worked as a scribe under Zeng Nongran, the master of the You Tian Xi Hai Studio. With the talent of a magistrate, he retired to pursue painting and poetry, which are also deeply rooted. He is truly a unique figure in the art world.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Postscript to the Mute Love Lawsuit <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Hengzhuang</p>
<p>After the mute love case involving Lin Jim and Wu Airong occurred, in order to maintain their livelihood and save face with relatives and friends, the loving couple simultaneously joined the Current Affairs Film Company as actors. The company took the opportunity to produce the film "Mute Lovers," with Lin and Wu as the main characters and Chen Zhuomin as the director. The plot is a true depiction of the main actors' experiences. Filming began three months ago and has now been completed. Lin and Wu receive a monthly salary of one hundred yuan, which solves their livelihood problems. Now that the lawsuit has ended, the film starring Lin and Wu will also be screened at the Central Theater. In order to increase its appeal, the company has obtained Lin and Wu's consent to perform on stage at the same time as the film. However, since Lin is mute, the problem of performing is particularly difficult. Therefore, the responsible personnel of the company consulted Mr. Zhou Shixun. Zhou is good at planning and created a mute drama entitled "Unspeakable Secret," in which Lin plays a heartbroken musician and Wu plays a maiden. The plot is extremely subtle, and the scenery and costumes are quite beautiful. However, Zhou, in order to demand the actors' movements and expressions, specially invited Mr. Tao Zhongcheng to direct. For days, the loving couple rushed around Carter Road, extremely busy. Sometimes, Wu Airong even brought the baby Lin Jim to rehearsals so she could breastfeed him. It is also heard that on the day of the performance, Wu Airong will sing a love song, with lyrics composed by the famous musician Pan Boying, the words of which express the utmost grief. Therefore, in addition to singing lullabies, Wu Airong's boudoir life has added another kind of mood.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Travel Notes from Nanyang (48) <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>The local natives here are simple in knowledge, kind in behavior, and rich in ancient customs. There are absolutely no cases of theft or robbery, but I fear that the arrival of Chinese people will gradually disrupt this. In the past, the Mongol disciple Wu Fuyuan often talked about this. The Mongols used earthen carts to push silver ingots, loaded with straw, and placed them in the wilderness without fear of bandits or robbery. Also, Mrs. Huang Zhaogui of Singapore told me that she was at the house of a local gentry. The gentry returned from overseas with many pearls and showed them to guests. The glass windows around his room were wide open, with no one guarding them. Even the Malays gathered to watch. Mrs. Huang privately thought that if there were a robbery, she would also be implicated. But in fact, the morality of the Nanyang natives is very high, and there is absolutely no such thing to worry about. However, in recent years, the number of Chinese people has increased, and kidnapping has gradually spread to the South, which is worrying for the future.</p>
<p>Seeing the peace and tranquility of the Malay villages, I wrote a poem to express its meaning:</p>
<p>From Klang to Kuala Lumpur, seeing the Nanyang villages, it proves the culture of today's Tock Workers and the ancient Lao Zhuang.</p>
<p>From Klang to Kuala Lumpur, it is about sixty miles. The car or train takes an hour to arrive. Along the way, the rubber trees are high and low, filling the slopes. The branches reach the sky, shielding the sun. The green shade is cool and breezy. In the midst are the houses of the natives, a few feet off the ground. Red tiles and thatched roofs, clean and beautiful. Three or five families are shaded by sparse bamboo. Red men and green women live in peace until old age. White cows of Indian breed are rarely seen, along with chickens, dogs, and pigs. Banana trees and phoenix tails, purple flowers winding. Or there are pigeons and doves raised on the hillside by the water's edge. Railways and cars pass through, carrying loads and singing in harmony. Never hearing of turmoil or separation, being full is all that matters. I sigh at the well-governed small country with few people. Reading and still discussing what is difficult, I begin to prove the meaning of Lao Zhuang. Non-action leads to non-disturbance. The highest good is like flowing water, plowing and forgetting the emperor's power. Monkeys in hats destroy nests. Allow this long-term existence. Yao and Shun are true chaff. The setting sun and the cow's back are steady. The world is a worn-out shoe. The old man Xu Xing is a disciple, and the monarch and subject become waste paper. In the high heavens and thick earth, leisurely contentment is enough. Why use the sick Xia Kui and the shouldered foreheads? Yan Guang and Tao Yuanming have no remaining sons for a thousand years. This learning is now greatly illuminated. New villages replace cities. Tockes and Weirs' benevolence become fortifications. The early people's villages of Nanyang rely on this archaeological discovery. Advanced savages also. Above is no free reason, the forest is true life. Men and women enjoy themselves together. The great chaos in the world is what is contended for in the court and the market. Power cuts off people's heads and capital sucks people's marrow. Potted flowers dry up and pond fish, how can they reach old age? Classes become blind fights and false pleasures. I travel to Guilin, marveling at the beautiful mountains and waters. Immigrants can number in the millions, holding hoes and carrying plows. I will call out to Jieni and begin plowing from now on.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Verdant Bamboo and Mottled Doors, Her Heart Breaks; Red Lotus Fragrance, a Woman is Alone.</p>
<p>Since Zhang Yiqing lived with this unofficial old man, it was like a fish in water. Not only was their sexual harmony like a fish in water, but he was also like a fish in water economically. Because he was a capable man in the Shanghai business world, he could be called a genius. His methods of flirting with wealthy Shanghai merchants were as clever as those of Shanghai women. In the past, he inevitably had some empty runs, but it was not easy to form this situation. Now that he had a female army as a support team, it was like he was in the middle of an offensive and suddenly a reinforcement joined, naturally boosting his power. Zhang Yiqing's position was then booming. However, this woman was not weak either. As the saying goes, with wealth and power, since she had given Zhang Yiqing many rights, Zhang Yiqing had to fulfill some obligations to her. At that time, there was naturally a condition, and the most important condition was that Zhang Yiqing had to be a loyal believer to her. Not only should he treat the old man from Ningbo as nothing, but he also had to unify his thoughts and not allow any more random thoughts. Zhang Yiqing was very willing to swear when he first took office and received his duties, saying that anyone with different ambitions should be subjected to the old man's most severe punishment. However, this kind of male-female combination was like plating something with electricity. In the first few years, there was still enough electricity. Gradually, this young old man became a real old man. The youthful layer of electricity gradually faded away, and the two could no longer generate much electricity. If this friend's wife still possessed huge sums of money and did not relax at all, and Zhang Yiqing himself had no power to move, then he would have to submit to the old man and become a lifelong dresser slave. However, he had his own ability to move and felt that if he continued to be bound by others, how long would life be? What was the use of money if he could not enjoy himself in time? Moreover, no matter what kind of spouse lasted for more than ten years, love gradually decreased and conflicts gradually increased. When they were on good terms, everyone did not take a joke seriously. At that time, a great wind arose from the end of the duckweed, and often a completely unrelated word caused a great quarrel. Even if the quarrels of young couples were intense, when they were nestled in bed, peace filled the air. When studying physiology, they no longer debated about ethics. When they got older, it was not so easy to reconcile. For example, the woman Zhang Yiqing was messing with thought that she had brought the money in the first place and that Zhang Yiqing had become proud because of her help, which had cultivated a arrogant habit. Naturally, her temper got worse as she got older. Not only was she a closed-door emperor, but she sometimes scolded Zhang Yiqing. Zhang Yiqing was certainly a little annoyed by her, but under her accumulated power, he could not help but be a little afraid of her.</p>

<p>Finance: Gold Market Sees Slight Rebound</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was stable. There was a slight rebound, but no drastic changes. From morning to noon, there were five taels of money. There were only one or two taels of money. The trend of foreign exchange bills was tight and rising. Banks made some purchases and foreign firms also settled their accounts. However, the listed prices have been lengthened by one gear. It is said that the differences between open and secret transactions are special, and the industry's intentions have turned firm. Although the early market was peaceful, the price of large bars of silver was up by a quarter, and the price of silver was up by eight fen and six li. The price of silver in the US fell by sixteen fen and one li, but it did not move, probably because the US intended to sell silver bars. Later, it flourished. It is estimated that the reason for this is that the cabinet turmoil in Japan may be peaceful. In addition, as the swap period approaches, major players are chasing advances. Firms like Zhifeng, Yongshun, and Shunli, as well as hedging firms, have all rushed to buy. As a result, the market atmosphere has become auspicious and the price has risen to 57 taels. However, there was a slight reversal later, and it finally trended excellent. Later, due to the usual market closure on Saturdays, the market stopped.</p>
<p>The opening price for October was 553 taels and 3 qian, up 5 qian. The English and American silver markets both rose, but the gross price seemed to soften, falling to 51.2 taels, which immediately trended high. Later, it rose from 52 taels and 6 qian to 57 taels. Wanxing, Shunli, Zhifeng, Yong and others all sold their shares and bought them. It was first announced that the price had increased by 25 US dollars, 5 jiao, and the Japanese gold had fallen by 1 fen and 75 li, so it retreated to 55 taels and 23 qian. However, the price of the monthly English gold was traded by each bank at 7 pennies 68753, and it was once sold at 11 months 875. The inner plate was particularly firm because Dalian gang, Zhifeng, Yong and others bought it continuously, so at 10:00, the price rose to 56 taels and 7 qian. Before long, the price was reduced by slightly more than 2 taels to 4 taels and 9 qian. In an instant, it rose by another tael to 56 taels and 1 qian. After 10:30, the surface of the mast sold off seems to be active, so it was suppressed by slightly more than one or two to fifty-four taels and four or five qian. After a moment, it was seen to rise again. HSBC bought 10-month US dollars for 40 yuan, which was sold by Sumitomo. Then Taikang Runjin sold 12-month English gold to Holland for 7 pennies and 875, and Xinxing and others made further advances, so the price jumped up to 3 taels. At 11:30, it reached 57 taels and 6 qian. After a few minutes, it dropped by 1 tael. The closing price at noon was 56 taels and 6 qian, a rebound of 3 taels and 8 qian compared to the previous day. After 12:00, it rose again by 1 tael, actually reaching around 58 taels. As a result, hedging firms and Fuchang and others chased purchases. The largest price in half a day was 57 taels and 6 qian, and the smallest price was 52 taels and 6 qian, a fluctuation of 5 taels. The announced price has been changed to 603 taels, a discount of 1 fen and 75 li. The initial price was 47 taels, then 45 or 6 taels. The closing price at noon was 46 taels. Registration was 68 taels to 57 taels, and the water supplement was 68 taels. The opening price of goods was 53 taels and 4 qian, and the harvest price was 57 taels and 8 qian.</p>
<p>The buying and selling of each firm is different, but the major players are competing to purchase it. It is estimated that Zhifeng, Yongshun Shunli, Wanxing, Xiexing, Yongchengchang, Yongfeng, Bingxing, as well as hedging firms are advancing. Yuancheng, Yiyu, Fuyu, Hengxingyuan, Jinda Yong and others are mostly selling. Dadecheng, Yuanmao Yong, Yuancheng Yong, Taikang Run, Yu Da, Xinxing, Shunmao, Hengxing and others are coming and going. The Dalian gang bought more than 2,000 foreign exchange bills for hedging, and sold 300 or 400. The Guangdong gang sold about 1,000, a break-even point, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Foreign Exchange: Apparently Slack, Actually Tight <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Saturday, the foreign exchange market was only open for half a day in the morning as usual. The overseas silver market rose sharply, and the exchange rates between England and the United States both fell. The Japanese and American exchange rates also fell by 0.0625. Therefore, HSBC's listed prices for each exchange rate have been lengthened by one gear. The English gold was lengthened by 25 to 1 shilling and 7 pennies and a half. The US dollar was increased by 5 jiao to 39 yuan and 5 jiao. The Indian rupee was increased by 1 yuan and a half, totaling 109 rupees. The French franc was increased by 12 yuan, totaling 1,005 yuan. The French exchange rate was increased by 2 yuan and 5 jiao, totaling 166 marks. The Union dollar was increased by 1 yuan and 25 jiao, totaling 98 shields. The slope exchange rate was reduced by 1 tael and 75 qian, totaling 142 taels and 5 qian. The Hong Kong exchange rate was reduced by 1 tael and 25 qian, totaling 81 taels and 5 qian. The Japanese exchange rate was reduced by 1 fen and 75 li, totaling 1 tael, 2 qian, and 5 fen. However, the transaction price in the bank's internal market trended upward. It was stable at first, and then became increasingly tight. It is truly a strange situation of apparently lengthening but secretly shrinking. The reason for this is that foreign firms have settled their accounts, which is good for the gold market in proportion. Also, the swap period is approaching, and the political situation in Japan seems to be turning peaceful. As a result, people's hearts are rising, and major players are competing to purchase, fearing that the swap period will be oppressed by many parties and that the short sellers will have to pay more. Therefore, the foreign exchange bills are tense. By the time the market closed at noon, compared to the day before yesterday (the 12th), the English gold was reduced by 1.875, the US dollar was reduced by 3.75, and the Japanese gold was increased by 1 fen. China Merchants Bank, Taikang Run, and others sold tens of thousands of pounds of English gold to HSBC and Holland. Also, the Dalian Gang's hedging remittances were sold for several tens of thousands of pounds. Each bank did five or six million pounds in mutual transactions, but the gold firms sometimes settled a small number. Also, more than 100,000 yuan was traded for US dollars. Also, the Silver Company sold several tens of thousands of yuan, which was absorbed by Huabi. There were few transactions in Japanese gold. Only Zhengjin made a slight advance. The market situation in the near future is so uncertain that it is difficult to guess.</p>

<p>Yesterday, according to the London telegraph, large bars of silver turned to increase the foot. Chinese bought in. After the close, Citibank seemed to be selling. The near and far periods are both lengthened by 25 to 16 pence 875 (equivalent to English gold for 1 shilling, 7 pence, 9375). Also, a New York telegraph arrived, and the American silver price also rose sharply by 625 to 3 jiao, 6 fen, 625. The English to American dollar fell by 1875 to 4 yuan, 8 jiao, 5 fen, 9375. The American to English dollar fell slightly by 125 to 4 yuan, 8 jiao, 5 fen, 96875. The Japanese to American dollar fell by 0625 to 49 yuan, 375.

The spot price of Mumbai increased by 4 ounces, totaling 48 rupees, 02 ounces. Also, in the morning I asked Reuters and at noon the telegraph arrived, and there was no honor or disgrace.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Foreign Cents Rise to the Peak <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday, being the weekend, the market atmosphere was quiet as usual. However, the market price of foreign cents seemed slack and people's hearts were loose in the morning, so it slightly rebounded and fell. However, the market suddenly became smart again in the afternoon. As a result, it exceeded the original amount and opened a new plate unseen this year. At a time when this situation is rising to the peak, if the source is interrupted, it will surely rise straight to the sky. According to industry insiders, there are still several percent of good faces, but the future use may have a return, and then the price may have to continue to fall.</p>
<p>Cent拆 Prices (Foreign Cents): The situation in the early market was slightly soft, so the market price fell by 2 hao and a half compared to the previous day to 7 qian, 2 fen, 9 li, 7 hao and a half. The market in the afternoon still rose sharply to 7 qian, 3 fen, 03 hao and a half, which was better than the early market by half, and also rose by 2 hao and a half compared to the previous day's market price. The result was a new high price that has not been seen this year. (拆) The two markets in the morning and afternoon are still 5 points. The mercury root is not slack, but is not as strong as the previous day.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Situation: The prices for Jiangnan small foreign dollars were the same in the morning and afternoon markets at 6 qian, 4 fen, and 7 li, with no difference from the previous day's afternoon market. The trading volume was 4,000 jiao in the morning market and 5,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The prices for Guangdong small foreign dollars were 6 qian, 3 fen, and 2 li in the morning market, and 6 qian, 3 fen, 2 li, 6 hao, and 2 hufen and a half in the afternoon market. As a result, it was better than the previous day's early market by 1 hao and 2 hufen and a half. The upward trend will be seen to increase in the future. The trading volume was 160,000 jiao in the morning market and 120,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The return of copper coins increased by 2,000 to 387,000.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow (Silver 款): Yesterday was Saturday, and the banks were closed in the afternoon. All kinds of receipts and remittances were combined and sorted out next Monday due to time constraints. Therefore, the receipts and remittances in yesterday's market were light. The receipts and remittances of Chinese merchants were more than 1.4 million, the receipts and remittances of foreign merchants were more than 900,000, and various cargo, exchange tax, and miscellaneous receipts and remittances were 6.45 million, and the warehouse exit was 800,000.

<p>Some say it will rise to 6 qian and 4 fen.</p>
<p>Since the old jiao was smelted, the only subsidiary coin used in Shanghai society is the four-open Guangdong corner. The new jiao was made in Shantou this year, but because the fineness was inferior, it could not circulate in Shanghai and was prohibited. Only those that have been used to each other are circulating. The estimated amount is probably enough to meet the needs of society. Later, due to a large number of imports from foreign ports, the market price of this item has been declining. When it was at its lowest price, it was only 5 qian and 56 fen in March and April of last year, with each yuan of national currency being 12 jiao and 455 fen. Until February and March of this spring, it was still rising and falling, but it was only more than 5 qian and 9 fen. It suddenly began to rise sharply in mid-July and August, with a large number of Dalian gangs going to Weitun, amounting to no less than several million jiao, causing the price to gradually rise. On the way, the price once plummeted due to the confiscation by the customs and the sale to Shanghai. After that, the loaders continued to ship, and the price rose again until the present. It has actually risen by 34 fen, and according to industry insiders, although it has been rising and falling recently, it must continue to rise in the end. The market price of 6 qian and 4 fen must eventually be present. Let us record this to see what happens later.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the public debt market was still short of spot goods, and futures were also slightly calmer than before. As for the trend of bond prices, the customs, disarmament, compilation, and the 19th-year cigarette bonds were actively sold on the market, and the trend was downstream. The total spot trading volume for the whole day was only 4,000 yuan, and the futures trading volume was more than 8.6 million. The rise and fall of each bond are listed on the left.</p>

<p>The situation in the yarn market is increasingly sluggish, mainly due to the poor environment. Currently, it is quiet, and buyers are showing anxiety. If this stagnation continues, the future may change.</p>
<p>The Man-Mark (人標) is increasingly declining. The opening price of the Man-Mark market followed the downward trend of American cotton, which dampened market confidence. Some bulls closed out their positions, and prices for all months fell below the 50 tael mark. As a result, prices fell by three, five, or six mace for each month. In the afternoon, it was reported that yarn sales had stopped, and market sentiment was very weak. Prices for all months fell by another three or four mace. The total turnover for the day was 20,500 bales. Public Tai sold 1,850 bales, Rui Da 1,550 bales, Yi Yu 700 bales, He Shen 600 bales, and others 400 to 550 bales. Shen Chang bought 1,000 bales, Public Tai 1,350 bales, Yi Yu 3,700 bales, and others 300 to 450 bales. The closing prices for Man-Mark are recorded below:</p>
<p>Man-Mark Closing Prices</p>

<p>The cotton market situation is unfavorable. American cotton is extremely weak, with new low prices appearing for the October and December contracts. However, the local market sentiment has not declined significantly because some bulls are holding on tightly, expecting higher prices. However, one firm's previous purchases now face an unfavorable environment and are secretly being released. Furthermore, the exchange rate is shifting, and Indian cotton is taking the opportunity to enter the market at lower prices. Considering foreign cotton, the future is still difficult to stabilize.</p>
<p>Han-Mark (漢標) trends are sparse. The opening price of the Han-Mark market followed the downward trend of foreign cotton. However, the bulls held on tightly, and prices for all months only fell by one or two mace. In the afternoon, the yarn market was unfavorable, and the situation slightly weakened, with prices for all months falling by one mace. The total turnover for the day was 43,000 bales. Shen Yu bought 2,500 bales, Heng De 2,700 bales, Feng 3,200 bales, Yi Yu 1,800 bales, and others 1,000 to 1,300 bales. Tian Chang sold 5,700 bales, Da Feng 2,600 bales, Rui Da 2,700 bales, Mao Ji 2,000 bales, and others 900 to 2,800 bales. The closing prices for Han-Mark are recorded below:</p>

<p>American cotton fell another 25 points. Yesterday, American cotton was weak due to a lack of significant buying, poor news from Liverpool, and low consumption.

<p>A telegram from New York on the 12th reports on the cotton market during the week, stating that the government's estimate report this week was approximately 300,000 bales higher than the public's expectations. As a result, bulls closed out their positions, and there were also new sales. However, the downward trend was met with significant absorption. The spot situation did not show weakness, and there was also a hoarding movement in the South. Therefore, the market rebounded after professional buying and short covering. There was relatively little hedging, so the underlying trend was stable. As for the current market action, it entirely depends on the market situation in the South.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the volume of hedge selling is limited, and professional traders are buying futures at limit prices. The negative impact of the Department of Agriculture's report was offset by speculative short covering. Although cooperatives are hoarding large quantities of spot cotton, demand is flat, and yarn mills are still reducing production. Since the release of the Department of Agriculture's report, domestic piece goods trade has become even more stagnant. The following is an attached table of American cotton statistics for the end of the week (unit: thousands of bales):</p>
<p>Year 1929	Year 1930</p>

<p>Qiaoxi New Japonica is Becoming Scarce</p>
<p>Zhabei: The source of goods arriving yesterday was not much. Ke Xian rice coming by truck was more active. The sales activity on this street is moderate because the market situation on the road inside the city is reported to be stable. Furthermore, there is a continuous supply of imported rice and Yangtze River rice, so people are not optimistic about higher prices. Although appetite is good, purchasing power is tight. The price of Bai Po rice has not fluctuated much because the goods are scarce. The prices of all high and medium grade Japonica rice are the same as the previous market. Several dozen shi of Xixin Japonica rice arrived, and the quality can be described as top-notch. The price is 20 yuan and 5 jiao, which is 5 or 6 jiao more expensive than last year. The supply of Dongxin Japonica rice is becoming even more depleted. Rice mills' willingness to sell remains weak, and the price remains at 18 yuan and a half. New Yang Jian rice is gradually becoming abundant, and the price has weakened by 2 jiao, only at 15 yuan and a bit. New Ke Jian rice arrives in Shanghai in about 20 truckloads every day, and there were slightly more buyers yesterday. Therefore, everyone is taking a short position, so the market price has slightly decreased by 2 or 3 jiao. Top-notch goods are offered at 14 yuan, while the discount on ordinary goods is very substantial. There are very few high-quality Bo Dao rice, and ordinary rice is also scarce. The large market opens at 20 yuan and half, while Bai Yuan rice remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Hunan: The source of goods from Hexia is becoming even more depleted. Although sales are active, transactions are minimal. The large market is extremely quiet. There is a slight supply of medium-grade Broken Japonica rice, and the market is stable. Su Tong goods continue to be offered at 20 yuan to 19 yuan and a half. New Japonica rice is generally hovering. The price of Dongxin Wu rice is the same as in the Zhabei market, at 17 yuan and a half. The price of new Japonica rice from this area is also very stable. The recent arrival of high-quality Bo Dao rice such as Qing Ding Jiao Li from this area has been frequent, so the price is still at the 21 yuan mark. The daily arrival of Yang Jian Xin Jian rice is quite substantial, and the sales seem to be weak. The market surface is slightly soft, and prices are weakening recently.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Tapioca Market Continues to Weaken <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the tapioca market in the morning and afternoon, the market prices for each month uniformly tended to weaken. Because the quoted price of imported wheat flour continued to decrease slightly, at 2, 4 jiao or 1 yuan, people's confidence naturally weakened further. Although manufacturers are still not loosening their grip on the current month, the environment is no longer what it used to be. In the end, it also trended downward. As for the distant months, although the manufacturers' attitude is still mainly firm, they are secretly releasing positions one after another. The major client of a certain major factory is even gradually engaging in wild selling. The only reason is that, according to the manufacturers, the amount of foreign ginseng tapioca flour already ordered by guest traders is not small. With this two-pronged approach, the future situation seems to be increasingly bleak. According to general speculation, the first target for the distant months is to fall to the 2 taels and 4 qian mark. As a result, the current month fell by 1.5 fen compared to the previous day, October fell by 1.75 fen, November and December fell by 1.25 fen, January fell by 1.75 fen, and February fell by 2 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Wheat Futures Market Plunges Unceasingly <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the market prices for each month uniformly plunged unceasingly. Because the quoted price of foreign wheat flour decreased again, people's confidence was even more discouraged. Furthermore, it was rumored that the manufacturers had already ordered four ships of foreign wheat flour, totaling approximately 10,000 tons or more. The settlement price was either 20 yuan or 29 yuan and 7 jiao and a half. Therefore, the future of the wheat market, in view of the formidable enemy of foreign wheat flour, if this continues, there will be little hope. Therefore, the strength of selling was rarely seen since the new market opened. However, it was heard that this type of foreign wheat flour is the United States government's strategic reserve grain. Standard wheat in that country is still not affordable as such. As a result, the current month fell by another 6 fen compared to the previous day, October and November fell by 5 fen, December fell by 6 fen, January fell by 5 fen, and February fell by 6 fen. The spot wheat market is exceptionally quiet because each factory is still holding on and not dealing. There have been no transactions in the entire city.</p>

<p>Price Opened at 21 Taels to 20 Taels</p>
<p>The first batch of new walnuts, totaling 7,000 bags, is Changping goods, all personally handled by experienced traders. The color and quality are still good. Because it is the first time seeing new goods, the trend is brisk, selling at 21 taels to 20 taels. It is also heard that land prices in Tianjin have tightened, and it may be difficult to loosen them in the short term.</p>

<p>Autumn Cocoons in Wuxi Have Generally Reached the Market. The cocoon markets established by various silk factories have begun collecting cocoons on the 10th. They were officially opened for weighing on the 12th. This year's autumn cocoons are of ordinary quality, and the cocoon harvest is about 70-80%. Currently, the autumn cocoons from the Northeast Road are priced at 47-48 yuan per dan. The opening of the cocoon markets on the Southwest Road is later. It is heard that the cocoon price may be slightly higher than the Northeast Road.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Yingzhuang Jinjiang foreign trade industry of Gaozhuang Zhenmei green tea in Wuyuan has greatly increased its sourcing. The intention to purchase from Baochang Yongxing and other firms has also become stronger. The selling price has shown a slight firming trend. However, the sales of Zhenmei tea from middle and low grades seem to be stagnant. Since the suspension of Russian trade for Gongxi, the accumulation has increased daily. The trend in the tea market must depend on whether or not the Russian trade can be opened.</p>

<p>The Belgian Independence Centennial Exposition was held at that time. One exhibition belonged to the various sub-countries and had a maritime nature, while the other, held in Liège, pertained to the industrial, commercial, and educational nature of the various countries. The Liège Exposition was further divided into northern and southern sections. The Chinese Pavilion was located in the northern International Pavilion, occupying an area of approximately 300 cubic meters. Because the International Pavilion had a roof and a cement floor, the Chinese Pavilion did not build a separate pavilion in order to be practical and economical. Although the area was not very large, the layout was appropriate and the decoration was magnificent and worth seeing. It was divided into three sections: agriculture, education, and industry and commerce. Two types of catalogs were printed, one being a general catalog and the other being an art catalog. In addition to inviting foreigners, the Chinese Pavilion officially opened on June 16th. Mr. Wendervelde, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Belgian government, participated, and Chinese and foreign participants were given tea, a copy of the Three Principles of the People, and four Exposition postcards. There was a banquet in the evening, and on August 2nd, the Belgian principal also moved to visit and add to the pavilion. The various items displayed in the pavilion were immediately praised and praised, and some people entrusted the purchase of herbal medicine and other items, showing their love for it. It can be seen that the exposition is scheduled to close in October. The representative of our country, Mr. Min Yi, will take the route through the United States in September to return to China.
