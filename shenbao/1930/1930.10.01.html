<p>樊迪文之談話</p>
<h3>昨晨招待中外記者</h3>
<p>比國前外交部長樊迪文氏、昨在霞飛路外交討論委員會、接見中外新聞記者、作公開之談話約、一小時半、茲紀之如次、　　來華任務樊迪文氏首答記者以此行任務、稱渠應中央研究院邀請、以大學敎授之資格來華、考察社會運動、政治狀况、等等、目的在乎學習、渠須切實聲明者、此來與政治絶無關係、更以在華時間、尙屬短促、觀察所及、甚不完全、故對中國之感想如何影像如何、　尙未能具體的表示意見、渠在北方時、能與政界人物接觸、對於工人運動、除在歐洲時看見中國工人運動的書籍外、實際上現尙未與中國工人發生關係、渠對中國工人運動、現尙無研究與考察時期、惟渠在北平、曾費許多時間、研究中國藝術、深覺中國之藝術文明、令人十分景仰、抵滬後渠昨與友人談、覺中國於革命過程中、内戰雖此起彼伏、綿綿不息、惟中國之社會經濟敎育等事業、仍舊進行、此亦足令人十分欽佩、至其對中國政治、不願發表意見、並非因中國革命尙未成功之故、英國克倫威爾之革命、二百年而成、法國一七九八年之革、命亦一百年遂得建設民主政治、中國革命迄今不及二十年耳、渠昨見共産黨之標語、稱吾爲帝國主義之走狗、此實寃枉、渠前任比國外交部長時、對中國極表同情、天津比租界之歸還中國、渠不無微勞、渠任外長、曾被比國保守派竭力攻擊、今渠在滬、擬作數次之公開演講、題目及講義、均未擬定、渠在北方、曾演講過、（一）第二國際與第一國際之比、較（二）三民主義與社會主義之比、較（三）國際和平之組織及其保障、在滬或將此三題重講、亦未可知、對於渠之演講、渠雖爲第二國際及比國社會黨之首領、然其目和、在作學理上之推敲、而不爲主義上之宣傳、</p>
<p>歐洲和平樊氏次答歐洲和平之前途、謂法意交惡、世人多以引起第二次之世界大戰爲慮、渠在日本時亦遇同樣之問題、惟渠深信、在最近之將來、歐洲决無發生二次大戰之危險、渠前在日内瓦國際聯盟時、曾與捷克總統梅塞列克氏談及此事、捷克總統引一譬喻曰、火無燃烊不燒、其意即謂、一九一四年、時歐洲滿儲燃料、因之發生歐戰之大火、現在該項燃料、均已燒成餘燼、燒無可燒、火安由起、此其一、現在不談歐洲各國之政府、而以歐洲之人民論、可謂無一人不厭戰、况列國軍備勢均力敵、如欲開戰、須事前各自拉攏、組織聯盟、打破均勢之局、然此於最近期内、爲不可能之事、故目下雖有數國政府當局、偶發危險性之言論、然亦不過虚張聲勢、實際上亦不敢冒天下之大不韙、以引起絶無把握之戰爭、法外長白里安、曾宣稱、渠在政一日、决不使戰事發生、此其二、抑更有進者、歐洲現有民主政治、及獨裁政治、兩大勢力、互爭消長、將來如民治勢力佔優勢、則歐洲和平、更無危險反之、如之如獨裁勢力佔優勢、則歐洲和平之前途、固未易言、然渠自信、目下之獨裁政治、爲歐戰後之反動、將來之歐洲、必爲民主政治之天下、可預言也、容或以德國之選舉、極右派之國有社會黨勝利、於歐洲全局、不無問題、渠意此亦爲暫時之現象、且國家社會黨、在一九二四年亦曾一度、在德國會中占優勢、其時並無重大變化發生、惟德之國家社會黨、如起而組織政府、則或不無若干關係耳、</p>
<p>德法邦交樊氏於德國對凡爾塞和約之態度、是否要求修改或取銷或履行作答曰、行國大部份人、對凡爾塞和約、在希望修改、在以政治外交手腕、作友誼的修改、而無心訴諸武力、德代表在一九二五年洛迦諾會議席上、有此聲明、至凡爾塞和約所載、西歐國界問題、如亞爾塞斯勞倫之歸還法國、及承認比利時之完全獨立二點、洛迦諾條約、加以證實、德國對此二點、亦承認爲已定之事實、無修改之餘地、蓋凡爾塞和約、因有戰勝國屈服戰敗國强力主持之弊、至洛迦諾條約、德代表根據德前外長史德萊斯曼外交政策、以自由意志與列國議定、而無可反汗者也、</p>
<p>國際聯盟樊氏最後談及國際聯盟、及白里安之歐聯計劃云、國際聯盟、以參與國政府之態度爲態度、參與國之代表、屬保守黨者、則難望其爲弱小民族謀福利、如係進步黨、則比較能顧到弱小民族之福利、至白里安之歐聯計劃、各國在原則上、都表示贊同、惟各國政府性質不同、故對歐聯計劃各有數點保留、渠對此計劃承認其爲理想的至欲成爲事實恐多困難也、至歐洲有第四國際組織之說、渠未所前聞、有之或爲意大利社會黨聯絡其他國家之社會黨之組織、亦未可知、</p>
<h3>昨晚大華飯店歡宴</h3>

<h3>閘北昨晚電燈熄滅頓成黑暗世界</h3>
<p>發電機脫去眞空</p>
<p>臨時向租界饋電</p>
<p>黑暗中幸無變故</p>
<p>今日可恢復原狀</p>
<p>昨晚閘北居民、一度過其十年前之夜中生活、街道黑暗、慘淡無光、七時以後、店舖紛紛閉門、停止交易、路上行人、倉忙歸家、最繁盛之寶山路·大統路·及恒豐路·等情形、與平時廻異、道上車馬喧鬧、瞻前顧後、誠恐偶不經心、互相碰撞也、自傍晚六時半起至八時三刻止、此兩小時間、人人心中咸望電燈之恢復光明閘北水電公司電話之鈴聲、無時或已其後經該公司與公共租界上海電力公司接洽、將租界之電輸入閘北、始於短時期間重見光明、惟此次電燈之忽然熄滅、並非電機損壞、實因吳淞殷行鄉之發電廠其使用新機、爲時不過兩日、工人尙屬生手、致一時不愼將眞空脫去、於是閘北一區之電燈電機、除與中山路方棚接通者外、其餘悉數停滅、即閘北自來水之供給</p>
<p>、在初亦略受影響、</p>
<p>電燈熄滅原因閘北用電、原由閘北水電公司向公共租界前工部局電氣處買來、轉售用戸、後電氣處出售於上海電力公司、此項用電、亦照舊供給、直至前日、該公司啓用吳淞殷行鄉發電廠之新機、始將輸電之火線截斷、第一日用本廠所發之電、供給用戸、成績甚佳、至昨日下午六時半許、用電方殷之時、忽爾電流中斷、閘北一區、頓成黑暗世界、其初以爲少有損壞、即可修復、孰知各用戸等　　　　　　　　　　　　待半小時至三刻鐘之久、仍不見光明前來、始行焦灼、記者聞訊後、恐其中另有别情、即驅車至殷行鄉發電廠一詢究竟、經工程師陳文甫君解釋電燈熄滅之原因、始覺恍然、緣發電廠中現有斯可逹發電機兩座、毎座電力一萬基羅華脫目下所開用者、屬第二號機第一日之經過情形頗佳、昨晚六時半左右該發電機忽然脫去眞空、失其拖動之力、電機即告停頓、而電流亦即中止矣、此機大約今日仍可照常工作、</p>
<p>黑暗閘北一瞥供給閘北用電之方棚間、共有兩處一在軍工路剪淞橋、一在中山路、前者多供給住戸用電、如寶山路·大統路·等一帶、均歸是處供給、後者所轄之用戸、比較在少數、中山路等附近之工廠用電、咸出自此方棚間、昨晚電流停止時、凡隸屬於剪淞橋方棚間者、無論電燈與發動機、均一律熄滅停頓、其屬於中山路者、因尙外來之電、未遭波及、自六時半許、電燈熄滅後、閘北居戸、大感不便、因其時上燈未幾、各住戸多在預備晚膳、電燈一熄、祇有暗中摸索而已、加以自來水因電流停止、而馬逹發生影響、亦暫告停頓、水電兩絶、更形恐慌、閘北四五兩區及各所公安局區所長深恐宵小之輩、在黑暗時期中、大肆活動、有礙公安、因即分别通知各崗位警士、加意防範、並囑令各店舖提早收市、以資安全、燈熄後約十分鐘、四區轄境共和路十五號崗警果於黑暗中獲得身懷武器之匪徒一名、帶回區署嚴辦、至黑暗時期中臘燭與煤氣燈之需要、更屬求過於供、惟最形狼狽者、則莫若路上摳衣掌傘之行人、雨絲飄零、四顧暗澹、大感狼狽耳</p>

<p>呼盜中槍受傷王老闆見狀、明知遇盜、然懾於淫威、不敢聲張、兩盜翻箱倒篋、並用鐵器將儲欵木箱撬開、箱内所有存欵、悉數被刦、正擬得贓下樓、王將起身呼捕、被盜開槍一響、彈中後肩、洞穿前膊、王負痛仍然倒下、流血沾褥　　一匪避入麪館三盜方得贓遁出門口、該店夥友即狂呼捕盜、附近警笛大鳴、而該處稍南、即華格臬路、爲杜月笙張嘯林二君住宅、保鏢者聞警畢集、四面兜捕、詎一盜見勢不妙、急中生智、遁入該當隔壁五十號永興館小麵店、冀圖掩飾倖免、</p>
<p>探捕生擒一匪同時探捕亦聞警赶到、查見該盜面色倉皇、探等遂將其擒獲帶入捕房、一面至該當勘視一過、盜等因倉卒圖遁、遺棄六寸勃郎林手槍一支、内有子彈四粒、隨將王老闆車送仁濟醫院、聞傷勢雖無大碍、然王平日患有咯血病、加之流血過多、身體上已受重創云上海各界籌募</p>

<h3>譚組厂軼聞</h3>
<p>— 乙乙廬主</p>
<p>國府前主席譚組厂°遽以中風逝世。四方聞之咸爲悼惜°京滬各報°載其平生甚詳°余忽憶數事°拉雜紀之於次。不瞳云爲譚氏之管窺蠡測也。</p>
<p>譚原名廷闓。以會試第一名成進士。爾時坊肆盛行闈墨。用備士子揣摩之需。攻科舉者幾於人手一編。亦猶今之所云投機事業者。譚氏之文。亦當然戸誦而家絃矣。此文余至今猶庋藏之。題目似出大學首章。清鼎旣革。譚任湖南都督。乃更名延闓。</p>
<p>譚善書。筆法髣髴翁相。秀媚弗及。而遒勁過之。昔年旅滬。應酬最多。余鄉人之乞其書者。無慮數十聯。前年復刻五十後作之印。想見此老雖公政旁午。而書興不衰。豈虞此印之壽。二年而即終乎。可慨矣。</p>
<p>某年。余游杭縣。居清泰第二旅館樓下五十三號有識譚者。語余曰。譚組厂來覔庽矣。余出視之。則譚冠常禮帽。烏褂白衫。手一洋繖。與數友後先上樓而去。蓋其時將復任湖南督軍也。貎不及市肆所售照片之清折亦不如今日之豐肥。友中有魁梧其身者。人指爲司法總長張耀曾。未知信否。是夕。譚等即庽於五十三號樓上。喧譁笑語。呼夫喝役。午夜未已。余不能安睡。詰旦遂行。</p>
<p>譚氏有廣州雜事詩數首。悲凉慷慨。兼而有之。雖不憶其年。玩其辭旨。必在癸丑二次革命之後。其時正袁氏枋國。英雄四散之秋也。詩云。蕉滿牆陰榕覆池。春花紅上木棉枝。重來庭院都非故。惟有斜陽似舊時。又云。冠劍雍容記舉觴。當時職事戒毌荒。廿年前事無人識。雪涕重經廣益堂。意在言中矣。豈計成功即在數年之後。生榮死哀。有如今茲哉。若譚氏者。亦可云無憾矣。</p>
<h3>袁觀瀾先生追悼會瑣記</h3>
<p>— 才良</p>
<p>寶山袁觀瀾先生。爲敎界名罕。道德文章。夙爲士林所景仰。曩曾供職敎部。頗多擘劃。對於義務敎育。尤著勞績。年來息影歇浦。從事著述。徵集史料。厥功尤偉。不幸於上月間偶攖小極。遽歸道山。何圖大業未竟老成已謝。緬想遺型。彌深悼嘆。日前本市中華職業敎育社等各團體。假座滬南職工敎育館開會追悼。素車白馬。頗極一時之盛茲將予所聞見者。拉雜記之如下。</p>
<p>盡瘁敎育　首由主席蔡孑民先生報告。略謂。予與袁先生有同寅之雅。論交可稱莫逆。猶憶曩年供職敎部時。深資臂助。五四學潮陡起。大有風雨滿城之勢。敎部適當其衝。頗難應付。幸賴袁公周旋其間。奔走各方。不辭勞瘁。學潮卒以平復他若同濟大學之收回國有。幾經交涉。始逹目的。凡此皆先生主持之力也。旋先生以不慣政治生活。辭職出洋。曾往歐美先進諸國。考察敎育維新事宜。歸國後抒述心得。公之同好。洋洋數十萬言。語皆中肯。此種好學不惓之精神。與夫鞠躬盡瘁之志願。誠足以模範千古。而垂諸不朽也。</p>
<p>儉德可風　繼由張仲仁先生演說。略謂袁先生生平雖歷長部務。疊任要職而自奉却甚菲薄。毫無官氣。蓋先生性甘淡泊不慕榮利。不若一般宦熱者流。輙喜自高身價頤指氣使任性縱欲。時艱世亂。未始無因語云。儉可養廉觀乎袁先生可以興矣。</p>
<p>見解透澈　末由黄任之先生演說。我國興學數十年來。尙乏效力。敎育不能與社會打成一片。實屬階厲。毎觀已受敎育之農工子弟。大都均不願重理故業。以致失業日增。社會乃大受其害又聞共黨中頗多受過中等敎育以上之學生。羼入其間。敎育前途。可勝浩嘆。予嘗聞袁先生有方。我所提倡之義務敎育。第一須使彼受敎者不脫其本業。然後學而致用。相得益彰。庶可告無罪於社會。而得敎育之眞價值矣。予甚願繼袁先生之志者。三復斯言。</p>
<p>輓聯一斑　各方所送輓聯。琳瑯滿目。佳者甚夥。姑就予所記憶者錄之。以供同好。陳陶遺聯云。住世六十五年。頂踵俱捐今墨子。示疾一刹那際。去來自在故中郎蔣維喬聯云。畢生爲敎育犧牲。傷哉濁世難居。到老反有求全之毁。所患非膏盲痼疾。誰料斯人猝逝。臨終曾無一面之緣吳研因聯云。學閥。敎育家。或有或非。已蓋棺。可有定論。熱腸。古道貎。亦廉亦惠。如銘墓。不易我言。沈恩孚聯云。衣食可惡。仕學兼優。即此勤邦儉家。豈獨宜祭於社。劬勞畢生。窮約至死。將以廉頑立懦。亦非故諷時賢。潘文安聯云。敎育惟普及是求。講道惟樸學是尙。孟晉如先生。無非胎元於滿腔熱血。待人存忠恕之道。服務存飢溺之懷。責成在後死。都應犧牲此全副精神。餘從略。</p>
<h3>猶是春明夢裏人</h3>
<p>— 說迷</p>
<p>浪跡江湖。忽焉廿載。雖載酒題襟。尋芳拾翠。異鄉花鳥。時復牽情。而霜鬢漸斑。塵心已死。因無復狂奴故態矣。海濱小憇。腥羶中人。覺十里夷塲。毫無尺寸之地足爲遣時寄暢之所。治事之暇。惟時至影戲院作二小時之勾留。然而無聊極矣。猶憶十載京塵。歡塲馳驟。意興甚豪。寗復知有今日。即捨身所經歴者不論。即就目所覩之怪狀。耳所聞之奇行。亦正可歌可泣。可笑可憐。偶一回想。眞覺奇趣横生。恨余非小說家。不能以生花之筆。曲曲爲之描寫。以供大衆之欣賞。毎引爲生平一大憾事。入秋以來。勞疾大作。遷入醫院靜養。向所恃爲唯一消遣良友之電影。至是亦祗得暫作小别。病榻苦寂。惟雜閱近人小說。以遣永畫。一昨有友惠示新山海經一部。計五厚册。初疑爲齊諧志怪之書。後見標明長篇社會香艶小說字樣。而又爲張秋蟲君最新著作。始姑受而讀之。蓋余素知張君爲海上著名小說家。其作品犀利深刻。而又哀感頑艶。又常聞人言。張君少年狂放。才氣縱横。不可一世。其小說自不可與坊間尋常新書可比。因盡三日之力讀之。始信文人之筆。靈妙不可以常情測見。書中記名七風流。娼優狡獪。官眷荒唐。武人市。目不暇接。凡余目所見耳所聞。以至目所未也。耳所未聞之艶秘。莫不一一收來紙上。妙到毫顚。時而時花好女。時而牛鬼蛇神。滴粉搓酥。畫龍捉鬼。靡不曲盡其妙。令閱者時而驚。時而喜。時而怒。時而咄咄稱奇。時而拍案呌絶。時而若置身書中。不自知其著迷也。可謂神乎技矣。妙在即極尋常之細事。一經作者之描寫。便覺詼詭奇詭。忍俊不禁。春明舊夢。彷彿重温。病中三復。愛莫能捨。濡筆記之。以公同好。</p>
<p>鵑按。新山海經爲吾友張秋蟲君第一傑作。張君驚才絶艶。譽滿海堧。無俟詞費。此書尤其精心撰著。不同凡響。說迷之言。非虚譽也。全書五十餘萬言。計五厚册。并由名畫家魯少飛君精繪彩圖五十幅。定價五元。特價祇售三元。四馬路光華書局現代書局聯合書店門市部以及麥家圈中央書店均有出售云。</p>

<h3>歐游通訊（七十五）</h3>
<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>巡禮意大利日記</p>
<p>（二）途中A</p>
<p>五月二十九日下午十時我們從巴黎里昻車站動身。正是孟夏時光白天很長。我們開車時太陽才落下去。此次同行的是吳恒勤。楊秀濤。顔文樑。孫福熙。我們向東南行經塞伏畱Savoia.越白峯入意大利在車廂裏大家隨便談談談到了羅馬以後觀覽的日程和用費的支配。當時我們就推舉秀濤管銀角。福熙記賬。後來福熙談得高興了。他就談起他與陳學昭女士戀愛的故事。他說。「當初如何的熱戀。如何的甜密。終竟則不明其所以然而誤解了。人家以爲她放棄了我。其實我何尙重視她。當初若心底地提携她。也不過做些點綴品罷了。愛。戀愛。那裏有。恐性不是人間所有的。我終覺得女隆是脆弱的。多變無常的。終是免不了虚榮和迷惑。值得我們戀愛的女性。或者竟是絶無。……「所以他是預備不娶妻不談戀愛的了。在那時我也曾勸他說。「你不要太偏視。這也不是可以一概而論。女性也並不見得盡是如此簡單吧。况且「愛」本來就是「缺陷」更没有什麽結果之可言。…「」他等了一會兒又說。「後來陳女士又與G君誤解一。他覺得她很可憐他忽然就寫了一封信給她。在巴黎。有一天就重復開始去看她了。想問問她的究竟。不料見面之後。她就大駡起來。「你這種下流的東西。我　是没有什麽空閒來和你談話。也没有心情來和你通信」。她眞是自視太高了。她不特誤解了我。而且誤解了她自已」。我便回答道。「誤解就是藝術。能夠任人誤解纔是偉大。我終以爲我們不必使人了解。還是任人誤解的好」。福熙就說。「所以你就吃虧了。有許多人誤解你。到現今我纔知道你的性格。啊。今後我也要放大膽子像你那樣叛去了。本來。我以前所寫的文章。我以前所畫的畫。何嘗是我的眞面目呢。你看罷。今後……」</p>
<p>「是的。我們只要不飾不僞向着本心要動的方」向而動。要游泳就得扎緊身子向水裏跳。我們本來就是傳統的叛徒。世俗的罪人。我旣不能敷衍苟安。尤不能妥協因循。我是一個爲人譏笑慣的獃子。但是我很願意跟着我内部生命的力去做一生獃子。現在的中國就是因爲有小手段。小能幹的人太多了。所以社會會弄到那樣輕浮。澆薄。我看你也很有幾分獃氣。我希望你做一個獃子我不希望你做一個耗子似的那樣小聰明的人」。這是我當時很起勁告訴福熙的話。</p>
<h3>芬蘭農民之反共運動</h3>
<p>— 六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>實際。此二十三名共黨議員在國會之存在及其活動。並不能成就何等革命之危險。但政府方面恐日後共黨之宣傳愈廣。一部分民衆被其利用。此外又有鄰國俄羅斯之種種援助。將使政府感受困難。故對於共黨有積極解决之必要。</p>
<p>政府應討共黨之態度旣如此。芬蘭農民對於共黨之態度適不謀而合。芬蘭無大農。芬蘭農民階級全由小作農組織而成。此輩小作農性情趨向保守。嚴肅而勤於工作。對於政治社會等方面不甚關心。但極富於愛國心。且拉普亞運動發源地Ostrobothnie中部一帶。宗敎勢力極盛。共黨宣傳旣與宗敎不利。故當地流行之宗敎思想更鼓動農民方面對於共黨之惡感。再有進者。在芬蘭獨立戰爭中。軍隊之大部分由農民階級組成。農民爲祖國流血特多。今目覩其血戰成績受共黨宣傳威脅有覆滅之虞。愛國仇共之心自不覺油然而生。數年來農民方面雖盡力容忍。來與共黨衝突。但憤鬱之情愈積愈深。正如火山之欲乘機爆發矣。</p>
<p>此火山最初爆發之地乃拉普亞。蓋拉普亞共産黨員模倣蘇俄。於一九二九年十一月末始。組織種種挑戰之集會。與會之責年共産黨身着紅色襯衫。並加綴俄國共黨標記。意氣洋洋。有威壓一切之概。此舉使農民方面大感不快。因而决定揭竿而起。與共黨以打擊。此即拉普亞運動之來源也。但最初暴動尙有相當節制。共産黨員雖飽受侮辱。但並無傷亡者。</p>
<p>自拉普亞農民首先與共黨衝突後。芬蘭全國旋即成立多數愛國組織。要求政府以嚴厲方法取則締共産主義。一時反共空氣籠罩全芬。拉普亞運動之名因以大著。</p>

<h3>洋厘忽然狂跌</h3>

<p>厘拆價格（洋厘）早市厘價爲七錢三分二厘一毫二忽半、較前日午市突跌二厘七毫半、午市賡續跌二毫半、爲七錢三分一厘八毫七忽半、如果各埠陸續有到、則市價恐將不支耳、（銀拆）銀拆早市七分、午市三分較前日市價遞跌一半有强、市氣又現鬆軟、故劃頭加水祗二三分、而銀行掛牌無市矣、</p>

<p>今日證劵交易所因本埠金融業均以秋節停市、故亦停止市塲交易一日、至昨各公債市面情形、現貨惟編遣七年兩種開出、其他均無交易、期市賣買尙不寂寞、債價趨勢上午殊穏、雖市上進出活潑、而求供甚平、殊鮮變化、後市賣氣較衰、買方續不寂寞、價乃一致回堅、結果比上週末裁兵期約漲　回一元、關稅編遣期貨各好六七角、除亦漲起四五角不等、計全日現貨僅成交一萬八千元、内編遣一萬五千元、七年三千元、期貨前後市各計五百六七十萬元、内裁兵佔五百餘萬、編遣三百二十六萬、關稅一百四十餘萬、一九捲烟亦有一百十餘萬、但其他各債仍頗清閑、債别前開後收較前日成交數</p>

<h3>紗花紗市略趨懈怠勢</h3>
<p>今日秋節紗交停市一日</p>
<p>紗市略疲、實以世界大勢情形不佳、致市氣稍軟、但某廠商心思仍堅、拉力甚强、目前紗市尙難穏定、仍有波瀾、至於潮州帮抛念尙濃、故多空兩方爭鬥劇烈、雙方均有相當勢力也、現紗銷路尙好、後步仍依實需爲進退耳、</p>
<p>人標晚收前陡萎人標前市開盤、美棉連跌兩日、散戸看跌、各月微小三四錢、二三盤回漲、實以大戸拉緊不放、故市况仍挺、結果近跌三五錢、遠漲一二錢、午後因明日停市一日、場中市氣忽鬆、賣戸增多、各跌七八九錢至一兩、查全日賣出榮興一千一百包、茂記六百五十包、吉豐七百五十包、漢豐六百包、逹豐六百五十包、其餘三百包至五百五十包、買進天成二千包、義餘六百五十包、其餘二百五十包至五百五十包、全日成交統計一萬五千四百包、茲將人標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>棉市靜定無變化</h3>
<p>棉市平靜、但美棉跌勢不定、此種影象、爲歷來所罕見、測其形勢、一角關口、恐難保存、然本埠人心依然堅挺、實以多頭拉緊不放、以内地來源未旺、收價高昻、故現棉各廠均無辦意、因搜購印美兩棉殊巨、且價格頗廉、故本棉地位早被外棉佔據矣、目前市况、處於擯持地位、</p>
<p>漢標晨鬆午微俏漢標前市開盤、散戸均看跌、以美花步跌不已、但場中賣氣未濃、各月跌五分至一錢午後因愼昌買進、市氣較緊、略漲五分、全日成交統計四萬一千五百擔、孟買進愼昌六千一百擔、天成二千八百擔、晋豐二千三百擔、其餘八百至一千擔、賣出利昌四千擔、天昌二千九百擔、源大二千八百擔其餘一千至一千七百擔、茲將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>海外花紗頻跌</h3>
<p>美棉南方套賣仍强昨日美棉因利物浦電訊不利、華爾街人心疲弱、及南方套賣而軟、計期貨跌十三至二十一磅音、現貨跌五磅音、英棉期貨跌八九點、現貨跌七點、埃及棉現貨跌十點、印棉市况堅穏、經紀商購進、計平果爾跌二羅比、奥姆辣及白羅溪跌三羅比、原電錄左、（二十九日電）</p>

<h3>糧食洋米定貨將到</h3>
<p>昨日客秈到銷兩平、市居定局、去路祗有本街一帮動辦、各路客帮均無問津幸邇日到頭不多、除江西略到外、湘米被稅捐匪共所阻、迄無續到、故市面尙能稍站、昨日成交江西機晚四百包價十二元至十一元八角、又機早五百包、價十一元至十元○四角、湘　八百五十包、價九元五角半至八元八角云、洋米定貨共有三萬左右、聞第一批將於今明到埠云┆┆</p>
<h3>九月分麵粉交割之盛况</h3>
<p>本外埠廠家棧單交進四十一萬一千包</p>
<p>昨日爲九月份期粉交割、全日之交割數量、較之新粉時令、適成比例、因新粉時各廠存底不豐、小麥又不合算、故至月底交割、均自動收回、因此交易所之期貨交割、彷彿徒有其名、九月份以客銷仍寂、小麥到源則反暢盛、致各廠之生産、無形增加、惟大戸多頭、恐吃虧過甚、不願隨時了結、各廠則存貨勢須待售、又覺市面之倒掛、已無再事抵回之必要、且不但本埠之中小廠如是情形、即外埠之加入標準者、亦均有棧單之交入、可見事實上存額之豐、已莫可爲諱也、總計全日交割之總數、共四十一萬一千包、聞中華之綠三星七萬七千包、福新之綠兵船一千包、信大之綠砲台九萬、信大信記綠砲台四萬二千包、華豐綠麥根五萬八千包九豐綠山鹿二萬零五百包、阜豐裕通之紅藍車十一萬六千五百包泰隆綠鷹球五千包、至收貨者聞仍以某大戸收去、客帮收去無幾、期貨總成交計九百五十八萬九千包列表于后、（單位千包）</p>

<h3>小麥進口將開始檢騐</h3>
<p>貨品不良廠家歷受暗耗</p>
<p>呈請檢騐自屬切要之圖</p>
<p>全滬存額計逹三十餘萬</p>
<p>此後進口一列須加檢騐</p>
<p>農礦部上海農産物檢查所鑒於農産物之良窳、於農農民之生計、及社會之需要、均有莫大之關係本埠麵粉廠家林立、全年採購外埠之小麥、爲數甚巨、慛珞地販戸及内地行家、貪圖小利、毎有泥土及雜物攙和之惡習、非從事檢騐、無以促進農産物之改良、聞該所對於此項檢騐已經籌妥、定十月一日起、無論火車輪船或民船進口者、均須經該所之檢騐後、方准賣買、如果貨品低劣、將一列退回、不准起卸、至以前之存麥、已由雜糧公會會長葉惠鈞商准該所、限一日起至五日止、由行家自行呈送登記、藉資體恤、故此後之小麥貨品、恐將一新耳目云、</p>
<h3>糖市抛貨荷赤開盤頗俏</h3>
<p>紐約期糖跌風頗銳</p>
<p>昨日糖市産區電訊、古巴現糖價爲一·○三一二五、比前電微跌六二五、紐約期糖十二月份價一·○一、明年三月份一·一一、五月份一·一八、比前各狂跌五分、爪哇現糖價八·三七五、比跌一八七五、期糖十月份價八·！二五、亦跌○六二五、十一月份價八·一二五、反回升○六二五、公會市塲劃盤、交易均見岑寂、惟外匯轉昻、而走銷殊滯、故市氣依然平疲、荷糖二十四號粗砂白新貨價至八兩、略有受手、陳貨乏人向津、靡細砂白八兩○五分、市尙平穏、荷赤市仍挻秀、乃號貨劃價六兩五錢七分半、出戸且缺、日糖N嘜八兩○五分J嘜八兩一錢七分半、TM嘜七兩七錢、TK嘜七兩九錢、進出亦懈、市上萎弱、抛貨荷糖有捷成洋行售開十月份裝船十號荷赤一千袋、價荷幣四元九角、新規加稅、尙屬俏秀、號盤國貨棉湖赤開三十包價元八兩四錢、又五十包價元八兩五錢、市均平穏云、</p>
<h3>南北貨蘭花子到存軋缺</h3>
<p>蘭花子近因到貨寥寥、存底軋缺、前日太原輪由厦抵申、僅到七十餘件、昨已開出、身乾色艶者價爲二十五兩許、以次差一二兩至二三兩不等、皆以色之黄否爲準的、最次者未開、後市如能多到、方有鬆望、</p>
<h3>絲茶洋莊絲銷完全停頓</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、益趨沈寂、緣歐美絲電均不見轉、滬埠各絲廠因反對公量、均預備停業、所有期絲現均停止抛售、歐美各莊手中揑貨甚充、無人問訊、昨市期現各絲完全停頓、</p>
<h3>茶市益形沉靜</h3>
<p>昨日珍眉珠茶等貨、均無大宗交易、各茶市盤、較前又低二三兩、大帮市面依然停頓、貢熙綠茶及祁寗紅茶、俄莊協助會雖已談盤論價、但昨市仍未正式開辦、現下秋節已届、市上存貨尙有十分之五六、茶價一跌再跌、市面之惡劣、誠爲近年來所未有也、</p>
<h3>疋頭客銷漸形清淡</h3>
<p>疋頭市面、昨日無甚變動、東貨北帮去路已漸落靜、蓋因各貨上漲過厲之故、惟川帮反形活動、昨來電添辦甚夥、蕉葉中山呢二錢八分、富有四海二錢七分七厘半、天上大柄絨二錢零七厘半、榮華富貴印花色汀二錢零七厘半、俱有大批辦去本街因時届節邊需胃亦呆、間有反而回出、故昨第一功直貢緞紫金山細嗶嘰等均稍轉軟、但行家方面昨雖大阪定價略有跌小、然金價復漲、合算滬市相差尙巨、故水浪絨開價續漲、洋美人爲二錢三分七厘半、雙犬二錢二分半、楊貴妃二錢二分、毛條絨亦急轉直上、文明戲已須二錢五分、美人船二錢四分七厘半、細嗶嘰直貢呢仍無變化、西貨之放鯉直貢呢昨又上漲、行家已開二錢六分、川帮成交一百五十件、手貨爲二錢五分云、</p>

<h3>北游印象</h3>
<p>— 蘇靈</p>
<p>（九）哈爾濱之夜</p>
<p>「哈爾濱之夜」、是陣凝秋君作的一齣啞劇、那是描寫異國落泊的民族之悲苦的、在我還到哈之前、有華光劇團出演在華光劇院、</p>
<p>陳君對我說這啞劇的演出是有相當成績的、尤其在舞臺裝製上有滿意的成功、燈光的變化、很給這劇增添不少情調、因爲華光劇院的舞臺的帮助的原故、</p>
<p>劇情是三個落泊異國的乞兒、一個背着吉逹兒、一個帶着曼陀林、一個打着小鼓、佇立在這異國的繁華的街頭、飄着雪、在寒風裏、顫慓地、用凍疆的手、操着古舊的破琴、哀哀的絃音散落在凍冷的空氣理、喧嚷的市上、雪花中、街燈的寒光下、……然而、異國的人們、那時裝的貴婦人、大肚皮的商店老閭、……穿梭似地由這三個乞兒面前經過、他們、都好像没有看見這三個異族的依落者、没有聽到那顫抖的絃音、和好似一顆心在抖慄般的小鼓的聲音樣的、他們穿梭似走他們的路、女人們喜笑着、男人們舞着手杖</p>
<p>咖啡店的燈光漸漸地洞明、由洞明而變化了各種的顔色、現在、已漸漸地黯淡了、街上的行人也漸漸稀少、漸漸没有了、雪是下得更大、在寒風裏舞着、三個乞兒、可憐地、絃音也寂止了、餓、凍、這無家的人、終于只有倒睡在雪裏、顫顫地、深夜了、寒風也那樣的凄寂、這個時候、威嚴的驚察來了、舞動着小棍、用足趕他們走……</p>
<p>咖啡店的燈光已滅了、除了雪在寒風裏飄舞、一切都靜止着、</p>
<p>陳君這劇是取材在哈爾濱的中央大街、所以聽「哈爾濱之夜、」他說完這劇的内容、於是他整了整奇逹兒的絃、彈起那三個乞兒彈的曲子來、哀怨的絃音在寒夜裏顫動、</p>
<p>我從陳君那裏出來、經過中央大街回寓所去、</p>
<p>忽然一種熟悉的聲音引誘着我、哦、在那街端的黑暗的一角、不是嗎、那裏佇立着陳君劇中的三個角色、呵、三個異國落泊的乞兒、沈默地、顫顫地、撥着殭凍的絃、悽抑的顫音、漾漾在行人穿梭般地衣角的磨擦中、</p>
<p>歸來、我拾得一塊無用的畫布、在燈光下、畫成了這三個乞兒、並且、我添上了一隻黑小狗、背景是這個北地都市的夜影、</p>
<p>我把這畫題做「夜曲、」</p>

<p>汽車新聞</p>
<p>專論</p>
<h3>車式名彙各國已定一律名稱</h3>
<p>— 吉人</p>
<p>車身式樣名稱。各國不同。英法美國之各大車身製造廠。近鑒各廠出品之衆多與其名稱之複雜。非但廠家無所標準。尤使車主難以區别。因此發起編集車式名彙。以定各車之標準名稱。</p>
<p>試以（可背Coupe）之名爲例。各國之見解不同。在美「可背」係單座轎車之名稱。在法「可背」之名。乃呼一種轎蓬車。在别國或又爲另一種車輛之稱呼。由此可知車名差别之巨。實有確定之必要。</p>
<p>今以英法美三國車廠所編之車式名稱錄比較之下。均以法國者最爲詳細有條。其編製法根據二十二種車式之門窗地位與數目。此種車輛之車頂與後部。裝置活落。可以變化五十四種之車式。一見即能識别。法名之缺點。即其定名略爲專門。對於廠方固覺便利。然於車主與推銷員。實不易記憶。</p>
<p>車輛别爲四類轎車。轎蓬車。蓬車與貴族車。各式後端放長。即變爲跑車。貴族車上裝一活動車頂。便爲半轎車。</p>
<p>美國汽車工程協會所編之車名錄。較爲簡單。然不甚詳。計包括十六種車式。大部爲轎車。十種基本式樣。如跑車。小轎車。跑蓬車。蓬車。轎車與城市車。其他則爲標準式之變相。致於貴族車内有車夫間者。祇有二種。此項車式。在歐洲最爲風行。</p>
<p>英國以蓬車爲著。車式之名稱。亦有二十種。由英國工程標準協會審定。在此二十種内。祗四種爲轎車。其餘悉爲蓬車。可見英國人士喜歡空氣與愛賞風景之心理矣。</p>
<p>英國人之喜用汽車旅行。或作野外生活。亦頗著名。一年四季。道上往來汽車。滿載日用傢伙者。不絶於途。可謂英國之國風也。</p>
<p>英美車名之來源。起於法文。字音雖同。意義各别。致於車身建造。美國素著。毎年製造總額。在各國車廠之上。惟四五年來。歐洲人士注意於此提倡自振集資闊充車身建造事業。以抵制外貨。故美國之車身製造事業。不無無響。然有美國通用汽車製造總廠與其他各廠之大宗需要。其營業尙能佔據各國之上。</p>
<p>近年來車樣日新。進步益速。歐洲各車廠亦重車式外觀。並求其出品廉美。故均有較完備之機械設置。用機械工作製造。是以出品漸趨大宗。然與美國車廠尙無競爭云。</p>
<h3>三十五年來美國汽車發逹史</h3>
<p>— 沛甘</p>
<p>通用汽車公司駐華總理克勒斯氏云。已往之三十五年中。汽車製造之變更改進。無時或已。蓋欲求汽車之得以日趨完美。兼有機械精良。駕駛便捷。及形式美觀之三長也。今試以昔日之舊車一輛。與一千九百三十年式之汽車互相比較。祖裔相形之下。堪發一笑。不過此種舊式汽車。亦自有其特點在。正不必以數十年來。新車輩出。而遽謂從前之舊式汽車。盡無價值可言也。</p>
<p>克氏又云。自一千八百九十五年來。美國所造之汽車。其式樣不下六百四十種。然遞至晚近。所存在之名製不過四十一種而已。此外惟有年老者或能略記一二。若新進之汽車駕駛者。則連其車名亦所不知也。不過此項汽車於汽車進展史中。不無勞蹟可言。能令標準式之汽車。以普通之售價。行銷於一般人之間。凡茲數百十種之模型。各求其前進之道。以解决切實之運輸事業焉。</p>
<p>合衆國爲最大之汽車出産者。毎一年間新出之汽車。自五十一種至一種不等。惟一千八百九十七年則並無新製問世。但早年之出品。壽命不長。亦無可諱。一千九百零五年前所出之一百三十六種汽車。其中十一種現尙存在。一千九百零五年及一千九百十年間。出世之汽車爲數逾一百二十九種。其中五種現尙行世。其後十年中又續出一百六十七種之新式樣。中有十一種。目下尙可得見而目之爲汽車中之前輩也。更後十年出産减少。祗有七十七種之新汽車。其内七八種現尙見之市上。</p>
<p>汽車式樣出産最多之時期。爲一九零一○一九零二○一九零三○一九零七○一九零八及一九一六等年。下列之表可以</p>
<h3>寶塔克馬逹奪水面錦標</h3>
<p>— 克勞</p>
<p>美國汽船速力比賽。今年在赫特森河内舉行。其中有一十九呎長之小汽船。裝置寶塔克六汽缸馬逹。毎小時可駛一百三十二英里。路程自愛爾奔尼至紐約。平均毎小時快度三十哩半。據駕駛員茄克氏云。寶塔克馬逹之抵抗力極大。上油及變速作用甚毎。故其此次得勝。實賴此機多多。</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>概見各年份出産之汽車式樣數目。其尤饒興味者。則一九零一年之新式樣爲四十七種。一九零二年爲三十三種。而一九零三年爲五十一種也。</p>

<h3>All Countries in the World Are Facing Economic Difficulties</h3>
<p>Japan is finding it difficult to prepare a budget due to reduced tax revenues. According to the revenue situation in mid-August, income will decrease by 150 million yuan, making national finances very difficult. Japan will also conduct a second national census, during which the most attention will be paid to unemployment surveys. The people's economic difficulties are also one of the government's biggest concerns.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom will hold an Imperial Conference. According to the Colonial Office's statement to newspaper reporters, one of the main tasks of the Imperial Conference is to invent methods to encourage the industrial sector and restore economic prosperity. The British government is also anxiously considering ways to remedy the economic downturn. In addition, the German government's financial reform plan includes moderately reducing the salaries of civil servants, reforming unemployment policies, and further reducing the budgets of various departments. Whether the policy can be passed in Congress is still unknown. The financial difficulties of Germany can also be imagined.</p>
<p>The above are all countries that are currently famous for their industry and commerce in the world and are also good at financial management. However, the extent of their difficulties can no longer be concealed. Therefore, the future trend of the world economy is also predictable.</p>

<h3>使團方面之時局觀</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to a key figure in the diplomatic corps, the collapse of the Yan-Feng-Wang coalition government in the north this time was due to the assembly of elements with different ideas and different agendas, forced into a united front, and the result was mostly like this. Even if Feng's army struggles again in the future, it will not affect the overall situation, because Yan Xishan and others have completely failed in their political strategy due to the clever telegram from the Northeast. It is believed that China will have an opportunity for unification and progress in the future, because the action of assembling 300,000 troops to oppose the central government is also ineffective. Therefore, those with 30,000 or 50,000 troops in the future may be able to restrain their ambitions slightly. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>德政府財政改革計劃</h3>
<p>An understanding has been reached with various political parties</p>
<p>Whether it can pass the parliament is still questionable</p>
<p>National Society, Berlin, 29th - Everyone is waiting for the government's financial and administrative reform plan, which is scheduled to be announced tomorrow. Therefore, the entire country's political and economic life has temporarily fallen into a state of stagnation. It is reported that the government has reached a complete understanding with various parties on this plan, but it is still far from obtaining a majority of votes in the parliament. The content is still kept secret. It is heard that it contains items such as appropriately reducing the salaries of civil servants, reforming unemployment policies, and further cutting the budgets of various departments. The cabinet's contact with the leaders of the left and right wings has stopped because some cabinet members are determined not to want the Social Democratic Party to join the cabinet, and some are absolutely unwilling to work with the National Socialist Party. In this situation, whether the government's reform plan can be passed in parliament will be known only on a temporary basis.</p>
<h3>英帝國會議</h3>
<p>Scheduled to open today</p>

<p>The Singapore Naval Base issue will also be brought up for discussion</p>
<h3>南非擬力爭獨立權</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th - British Colonial Secretary Thomas told reporters today about the upcoming Imperial Conference, saying that the provisions of the 1929 Legislative Council would be submitted to the conference for discussion, with the aim of making the constitutional relationship clearer, stating that overseas autonomous colonies are no less than the United Kingdom in fact and in form. He also said that the United Kingdom's participation in this conference did not have a predetermined policy. One of the main tasks of the Imperial Conference is to invent methods to encourage the industry to restore economic prosperity, and the issue of the Imperial Court's trial of inter-state and private nature events will also be debated by the conference. It is heard that the Imperial Conference's Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee will specifically consider the future of the Singapore Naval Base.</p>
<p>London News - General Hertzog, Governor-General of British South Africa, has come to England from Africa to attend the Imperial Conference to be held in London. It is said that he will do his best at the conference to advocate for the independence of South Africa. No matter what, this is one of the most important points, and he will never let it go. As usual, the report of the last conference will be read at the meeting, and the independence of other colonies, including Great Britain, was recognized at the last meeting. He will take this opportunity to strongly advocate for the independence of South Africa, which cannot be disputed. He believes that the people of South Africa will be able to cooperate more closely with the British Empire and its affiliates after the British government recognizes its autonomy. South Africa now regards the declaration of the first Imperial Conference in 1926 as its Magna Carta and no longer doubts its equal friendship with other countries. He does not believe that Great Britain or its affiliates will go back on their word, and his responsibility is to maintain all that he has obtained and not allow anyone to easily take it away. As for the economic issues of the Imperial Conference, in his opinion, they will also depend on the freedom of South Africa. He believes that his colleagues will recognize this statement, and the conference cannot accept any economic solutions that make the independence of South Africa a wavering issue. As for the saying of free trade among commercial countries, Hertzog believes that it is only a theory and is not easy to implement.</p>

<h3>日本稅収减少</h3>

The revenue situation in mid-August was worse than the previous month. In this situation, the revenue will still need to be reduced by 10 to 20 million yuan compared to the previous assessment. That is, income tax, business income tax, various consumption taxes, tariffs, etc., are all less than expected. Only lease tax and stamp revenue. In this state, it is inevitable that the actual budget will be reduced by about 120 million yuan. Adding the reduction in official business income and official property, the income will be reduced by more than 150 million yuan. The original budget compilation was difficult, but now it is even more difficult.</p>
<h3>孤島待斃之秘前總統父子</h3>
<p>The island is hot and has cold currents</p>
<p>According to Peruvian returnees, former Peruvian President Leguia, who failed, violently suppressed the opposition and stored 80 million yuan of his private property in American banks. Recently, the opposition in the country gained power and secretly boarded the first warship Grau, wanting to escape to the United States, but was arrested and placed on the isolated island of San Lorenzo with his son, one mile away from the country's port of Callao. When Leguia was in office, it was originally set up for political prisoners in exile. The island is more than 20 miles around, with no rain all year round, and the heat often does not fall below 90 degrees. Opposite the land, there is the world's only cold current, called Finder, which will freeze to death in a few minutes, and it is a rapid current, making it difficult to swim and escape. Since the Leguia father and son were released, because there are no prisons, they live in rock caves, which is what is called self-inflicted. (World)</p>

<h3>公電</h3>
<p>A telegram from Hankou is addressed to all newspapers, and the telegram from Deputy Commander Zhang Jian read, "After reading your clever telegram, your kind words are impressive. You care about the Party and the country, care about the people's livelihood, respect the central government, and promote unification. I read it repeatedly and admired it beyond words. Since the two rebellious Yan and Feng caused a war, destroyed peace, ravaged Jin and Yu, colluded with the communists, and poisoned the rivers and lakes, they did not hesitate to be the leaders of the Rong and willingly be the first. The central government has tried its best to guide them, but there is no way to stop the chaos, and only then did it declare war. The lonely heart is only to rectify discipline and protect the country's peace and unification. The order of our central government on August 23 and the circular telegram of our commander-in-chief are guilty of the chief culprit, and the co-conspirators are ignorant. The tone is clear, and harmony is encouraged. Your telegram's proposition is in line with our intentions. However, the two rebels are stubbornly evil and go further and further astray, leading to months of war. Now the rebels entrenched in Henan and Shandong have been successively eliminated. The public ministry is stationed in Pingjin, which is enough to chill the rebels. However, the chaos is caused by the people's hatred. If Yan and Feng are not removed, the national disaster will not end. I hope to uphold justice, implement the proposition, urge Yan and Feng to step down, and wait for the central government to take measures, so that the feudal warlords can suppress their hearts of causing chaos, and then the true unification of the country can be realized and permanent peace can be ensured. You are the pillar of the central government, and the group follows your example. Your high call will be answered in ten thousand valleys. Even if the rebels are in a corner, dare they not be convinced? The success of the revolution will depend on this.

<h3>Yu Xuezhong and Gao Jiyi Arrive in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Yu Xuezhong, Commander of the First Army of the Northeast, arrived in Tianjin yesterday (the 25th) with the rear guard of his army. Gao Jiyi, a member of the Northeast Political Committee and Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, also arrived in Tianjin yesterday morning. Yu and Gao stated that they were not involved in politics. Yu's remarks generally stated that the purpose of the Northeast Army's entry into the customs was to promote peace. The war zones of Lu and Yu have suffered greatly in recent times, and Hebei Province has also seen a sharp increase in donations and taxes due to increased war expenses. Miscellaneous troops are being arbitrarily recruited, and the people's burdens are increasing accordingly. If this continues unchecked, it will not only lead to widespread suffering, but the country will cease to be a country. Commander Zhang could not bear to stand by and watch, so he first ordered his army to enter the customs, so that at least several northern provinces could maintain peace. The garrison of our army is near Beiping, as well as Changxindian and Baodingfu. The Second and Third Army Commanders will lead their troops to follow our army into the customs on the 26th to maintain security in Tianjin and along the Jinpu Line. The selection of the Third Army Commander has not yet been determined and will not be mobilized unless necessary. As a soldier, I am not responsible for the takeover of political organs. However, before political measures are determined, no party is allowed to arbitrarily take over organs to avoid disrupting local order. It is hoped that the current authorities will maintain the status quo, etc. Gao's remarks stated that, in addition to transportation responsibilities, he was not responsible for military or political matters, and it was inconvenient to make responsible statements on military and political matters. That evening, Gao Jiyi hosted a dinner at the Dahua Hotel, inviting Cui Tingxian, Yu Xuezhong, and Yu's subordinates. At 8:00 a.m. today, Yu and Gao went to Ping by car. The defense of Tianjin is still being undertaken by the Tenth Regiment of the Sixty-Third Brigade of Yu's army. (September 26th)</p>
<h3>First Step in the Campaign Against Lu to be Completed</h3>
<p>Lu Xingming Expresses His Surrender</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Qian Yuguang of Lu's troops recently expressed his surrender to the provincial authorities and took up the position of Brigade Commander of the Provisional Provincial Defense First Brigade in Gutian. However, when Lin Shouguo's troops arrived at Daqiaotou, which is under Gutian's jurisdiction, Zhang Chunguang, Qian's deputy regimental commander, acted evasively, and they did not dare to advance rashly, entering the city only on the evening of the 23rd. Chen Heling's and Zhang Ziming's troops also sent personnel to the province yesterday to request incorporation. It is reported that the authorities have already approved, but the title is still being discussed. Lu Xingrong, seeing that the general situation was unfavorable, has moved his headquarters to the Majun Temple near Zhanghuban, to plan a retreat into Youxi. Zhou Zhiqún also led his troops to retreat to Shuikou. The Central Column of the Liu Division therefore advanced rapidly, generally taking Gutian with the land force, Chen Wantai taking Dahu from Beiling, Liu Shangzhi moving along the left bank of the Minjiang River, from Ganzhe, Baisha, and Daxiaoruo towards Shuikou, and Gui Zhenyuan moving along the right bank of the Minjiang River, taking Minqing from Houguan City. The first step of the plan against Lu will thus be completed. Lu Xingming, who went to Shanghai several months ago and has not returned, is the Brigade Commander of the First Brigade of Lu's troops. Yesterday, he telegraphed Fang Shengtao, stating that he was not involved in the January 6th Coup and that this war was purely instigated by one or two treacherous individuals. He is willing to return to Yanping to clean up the mess and await dispatch by the provincial authorities, and will send the six people he detained to the province immediately to atone for his sins, etc. Fang's visit to the province this time is to negotiate this issue with various parties, but the outcome is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Another report states that Fang Shengtao's mission to the province this time is approximately threefold: (1) Funding: After Yang Shuzhuang and He Gonggan negotiated, it was decided that the counties of Jinnan and Hui would allocate funds, and another sum would be raised and handed over to Fang for use at the front; (2) Weapons and ammunition: A large batch of ammunition needed by the Chen Guohui, Wang Zuqing, Lin Qinglong, and Training Regiment, etc., of the southern Fujian army participating in the battle, will also be allocated by the arsenal and handed over to Fang; (3) Combat plan: The eastern route army's central, left, and right wings have all advanced in sequence. After meeting with Fang, Yan Er'ai rushed to the front yesterday (the 25th) with the general attack order, commanding Chen Wantai's and Liu Shangzhi's brigades to advance rapidly. Lin Shouguo also ordered Qian Yuguang to set out towards Shuikou. Lin Bingzhou's regiment will advance after Qian's troops, taking a connection with the central column. Fang decided to take the Xiamen round tomorrow to return to his post and has telegraphed the various units at the front to attack Datian in two routes from Fangtengkeng Longhusi. (September 26th)</p>
<p>Another report states that the troops of the Lu Xingrong, Lu Xinming, and Zhou Zhiqún three brigades of Lu's troops in the area along the Minjiang River from Fuzhou to Yanping, including Ganzhe, Zhuqi, Baisha, Guanyuan, Dahu, Muyuan Ruoyang, Jiangyang, Anren, and Xuefeng, have gradually retreated after being attacked by the Liu Division. There is no trace of Lu's troops in the western suburbs of Fuzhou. The vanguard of Liu Shangzhi's brigade has now entered Minqing, and the vanguard of Chen Wantai's brigade has entered Yongtai. The Marine Corps Lin Shouguo's brigade has also entered Gutian. The first step of the military operation has been completed, and the second step is to attack Yanping. However, after Lu's troops withdrew from the western suburbs of Fuzhou, they used all their strength to defend the Shuikou area, which is a vital passage from the province to Yanping, and used the dangerous terrain with mountains on three sides and water on one side to build defensive works to block the provincial army's advance northward. On the 25th, after Yan Er'ai went to the front line to supervise the battle, he used Lin's brigade in coordination with Qian Yuguang's troops, Chen's brigade in coordination with Liang Jichuan's troops, and Liu's brigade in coordination with Huang Bingwu's troops, to launch a general attack on Shuikou in three routes from convenient paths, with Gui's brigade serving as the general reserve force in the rear. Contact began on the 26th, and there will be a fierce battle. As for the military situation in southern Fujian, Fang Shengtao has completed discussions with Yang Shuzhuang and Liu Heding in the province and will return to his post to command the various armies to attack Youxi from Dehua and Datian, to coordinate with the Fuzhou army, as soon as the funding and ammunition are received. Due to the large-scale offensive launched by the provincial army on both the east and west routes, Lu Fang has transferred all his troops to the front line to resist, leaving the rear extremely empty. There is only one regiment of garrison troops in Jianning and Shaowu, and bandits are rising up everywhere. Yanping has been alarmed several times in one night. All valuables and direct relatives have been moved back to the Sixth Capital of Youxi and stored in caves to avoid air raids. Furthermore, Chen Heling's and Zhang Ziming's two regiments, formerly under Chen Rongbiao, have surrendered to the provincial authorities and have retreated from Gutian into Luoyuan. Finally, news was received that Shuikou was captured this morning (the 27th), with Liu Shangzhi's brigade being the first to enter. Lu's troops retreated to Zhanghuban, on the border between Minqing and Yanping, and Liu's brigade is in pursuit. Yang Shuzhuang and Liu Heding have now ordered Lin Shouguo's and Chen Wantai's brigades to continue straight to Yanping. (September 27th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Provincial Regulations Restore Branch Offices in Various Prefectures</h3>
<p>Unredeemed Banknotes Rise to Over Ninety Percent</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, Guangdong's financial situation has been slightly more active than before. The biggest reason for this is that the financial treasury bonds issued a few days ago have been gradually delivered. According to news from the Finance Department yesterday, various collection agencies and groups in various places have remitted two to three million yuan in cash, in addition to branch treasuries. This has been transferred to the Central Bank for the purpose of redeeming unredeemed banknotes. On the 24th, the Central Bank convened a board meeting to discuss ways to restore various unredeemed banknotes. Attendees that day included directors Fan Qiwu, Jin Cengcheng, Lin Yunhai, and Shen Zaihe. The meeting opened at 2:00 p.m., with Governor Qu Guokang reporting on the Central Bank's business income and expenditure situation over the years. Next, the reorganization of the Central Bank's business and the plan to restore the business of branch offices in various places were discussed. The meeting adjourned at approximately 4:00 p.m. The Central Bank's Nanlu and Beihai Meilu branch offices have been forced to cease operations since the outbreak of the war in Guangxi Province, as Nanlu is connected to Guangxi and has been repeatedly ravaged by the enemy. The Central Bank has been increasingly well-funded recently, and the two branches cannot be allowed to remain closed for long. Therefore, at the board meeting that day, it was proposed that they be restored as soon as possible. A certain Yu, the director of the Beihai Central Bank branch office, arrived in the province yesterday to report on preparations for the resumption of business. At the same time, the Meilu branch office also sent a telegram to the province, stating that it could open during the day. It is now waiting for the provincial bank to send cash. After receiving the report, the Central Bank has prepared to dispatch a warship to transport tens of thousands of cash first, so that the two branches can allocate funds for resumption of business. If cash is delivered during the day, the two branches may be able to resume business on October 1st. While restoring branch offices, the Central Bank is also preparing to resume redemption. At the same time, the demand for unredeemed banknotes is increasing due to the payment of financial treasury bonds. Therefore, the value of unredeemed five-yuan and ten-yuan banknotes has risen daily. On the 24th, the market value at the entrance was 906, and the market value at the exit was 914. Based on this trend, there may be hope for continued gains. According to Finance Department Director Fan Qiwu, the timing of the resumption of redemption of unredeemed five-yuan and ten-yuan banknotes is a matter of financial secrecy and cannot be announced for the time being. In short, the war between the North and South is coming to an end, and the Central Bank's resumption of redemption will be as easy as turning one's hand. At present, the Central Bank has prepared seven to eight million yuan in funds and can announce redemption at any time. There are only over ten million yuan of unredeemed banknotes in the market these days, including less than one million yuan of unredeemed fifty-yuan notes. The remaining ten-yuan and five-yuan notes have increased in value recently due to increased demand, which is really what is expected. (September 26th)</p>
<h3>Bengbu News Regarding the Reorganization of the Anhui Provincial Government</h3>
<p>New Provincial Committee Takes Office on Schedule</p>
<p>Yue Shengxuan's Division Enters Anhui First</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The reorganization of the Anhui Provincial Government has been announced for many days. The newly appointed Provincial Government Chairman Chen Diaoyuan is still in Liuhe due to military affairs and has not been able to come to Anhui. The new provincial committee members, such as Civil Affairs Director Zhu Xi, Finance Director Yuan Jiapu, and Construction Director Chen Luanshu, have arrived in Beijing for many days. In the past, due to the financial problems of Anhui Province and the methods of dispatching troops to suppress bandits, it was necessary to consult with the central government in the long term. Therefore, the trip was delayed. Now that concrete measures have been determined for each item, it has been decided to go to Anhui to take office in the next few days. The provincial government has sent special commissioners to Beijing to welcome them. It is reported that Zhu and others have set the 1st of next month to take office. It is not yet certain whether Chen Diaoyuan will go to Anhui at present. According to people in Chen's general headquarters, his first policy for governing Anhui is to start by clearing out bandits. In addition to the Fan Xiji and other divisions at the front, Chen's directly subordinate troops have recently established the Fifty-Seventh Division, commanded by Yue Shengxuan, courtesy name Ming San, from Dantu, Jiangsu. Yue is Chen's old subordinate, originally a battalion commander, who has been promoted over the years to his current position. The Song Runtian and Liang Hongen brigades are both under the division's command. Song's troops are in Xuzhou, organized as the 169th Brigade, and Liang's troops are in Tengxian, organized as the 170th Brigade. Yue personally reviewed them separately a few days ago. Chen Diaoyuan believed that the division was well-trained and ordered it to enter Anhui as the basic force for suppressing bandits and garrisoning. Liang's brigade first set out southward from Tengxian. On the 25th, Liang Hongen arrived in Xuzhou, entered the city to visit Division Commander Yue, and led his troops south by train that evening. At 4:00 a.m. on the 26th, the first battalion of the 340th Regiment of the brigade first passed Bengbu by train. At 6:00 a.m. on the 27th, Regiment Commander Yan of the 340th Regiment led the second battalion to pass Bengbu by train. At 8:00 a.m., the entire 339th Regiment passed Bengbu by train. At 9:00 p.m., Yue Shengxuan led the division headquarters officers and the entire 341st Regiment to pass Bengbu by train. As soon as the various units arrived at Pukou, they transferred to riverboats and went west to Anqing. After Liang's brigade set out, the defense of Tengxian that was left behind will be filled by Ma Hongkui's troops. (September 28th)</p>
<h3>Extension of Time for Trade Union Reorganization for Three Months</h3>
<p>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Notifies Various Provinces and Cities for Compliance</p>
<p>Minister of Industry and Commerce Kong Xiangxi previously submitted to the Executive Yuan that since the promulgation of the Trade Union Law and its Implementation Regulations, many trade unions in various places had not been newly established or merged and reorganized in accordance with the law, requesting a slight restriction. The Executive Yuan forwarded it to the National Government, which in turn forwarded it to the Central Party Headquarters. Subsequently, a reply was received, advocating that the reorganization of people's organizations be guided in accordance with the resolution of the 102nd Central Standing Committee, extending the time limit by three months. The State Council then approved and ordered compliance. After receiving the order, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has notified the provincial and municipal governments a few days ago to comply. The text of the consultation is recorded as follows: "Since the promulgation of the Trade Union Law and its Implementation Regulations, many trade unions in various places have not been newly established or merged in accordance with the law, nor have they applied for an extension of time in accordance with the law. Not only does this hinder the effectiveness of the law, but it also increases administrative difficulties. Our ministry previously intended to slightly restrict the deadline for such registration and merger, and submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, which was forwarded to the National Government for approval. Now, within the Executive Yuan's 3362nd instruction, it is stated that the ministry's request to slightly restrict the deadline for the re-registration and merger of trade unions established before the implementation of the Trade Union Law and to notify the provinces and cities to comply within one month of receiving the document has been reported and instructed to be informed to the ministry. Now, within the National Government's instruction No. 508, it is stated that the ministry's request to restrict the deadline for the re-registration and merger of trade unions established before the implementation of the Trade Union Law and to notify the provinces and cities to comply within one month of receiving the document has been approved and requested to be forwarded to the Central Committee to order the compliance of all levels of party headquarters has been reported to the government, and it was resolved at the 88th State Council meeting to send it to the Central Party Headquarters for review. Now, within the Central Executive Committee's letter No. 13897, it is stated that the trade unions in various places have rarely re-registered or merged in accordance with the law. According to Article 24 of the Trade Union Law Implementation Regulations, the government should consider extending the deadline. However, the situations of trade unions in various places are not uniform. If in areas where military affairs have not yet ended and other areas with special circumstances, it seems too hasty to limit the completion to one month. It is found that the second article of the measures for guiding the reorganization of people's organizations passed by the 102nd Standing Committee of this conference states that 'Except as otherwise provided by laws and regulations, all party headquarters listed above must guide the reorganization of the people's organizations under their jurisdiction within three months of receiving these measures, but in special circumstances, they may apply to the training department of the Central Executive Committee for an extension level by level.' In order to facilitate the guidance of local party headquarters and the supervision of the government, it seems that the government should refer to the above resolution, order an extension of three months, and those with special circumstances may also apply for an extension. This is specially conveyed in this letter, hoping that you will check and handle it accordingly, etc. This was received, and it was immediately submitted to the 93rd State Council meeting of this government, and it was resolved to handle it accordingly. In addition to the fact that the measures for guiding people's organizations have been copied and circulated, it is ordered that the Executive Yuan should comply with and handle it accordingly, this order, etc. This was received, and it should be complied with and handled accordingly, and an order should be issued to the local competent authorities to order all trade unions in their respective districts to re-register or merge in accordance with the law within three months of receiving the document. Those with special circumstances should also promptly state the reasons for extending the deadline within three months and apply for approval in order to maintain the laws and regulations. In addition to distributing consultations, a corresponding consultation is requested for review and compliance by all subordinates."</p>

<h3>Local Correspondence Songjiang</h3>
<p>Sijing Robbery Case Lake Bandits Publicly Tried Sijing Town, in the county, was suddenly attacked by a large gang of lake bandits waving a flag with the character "Mao" on the afternoon of April 28th this year. The self-defense corps ran out of ammunition and had no reinforcements, and several people were killed or injured. Later, the troops and police of the neighboring Qingpu and Jiading counties intercepted the stolen goods and bandits involved in the case. The county government sent police to escort them separately. The county court was established and transferred the case to the court for investigation. The prosecutor's office has completed the investigation, finding that bandits Lin Zicheng, Xu Yubao, Wang Decai, Liu Zhizhong, Wang Quanyou, Zuo Jinchi, Zuo Gensheng, Wang Changyou, Hong Zuojiang, Mao Ziqing, Li Wenqing, Wu Zhiyi, Gui Xiaodi, Wu Jiyi, Gao Xuekui, Wu Zhiyu, Wang Shaoquan, Kong Lingchuan, Zhu Weiliu, Wu Hanying, Wang Yuqing, and Dong Dachuan, etc., gathered in the mountains and swamps, resisted government troops, formed large gangs, and engaged in robbery and murder. According to the Regulations on the Punishment of Bandits, Shen Wangshi and Shen Lushi should also be punished as principals for providing direct and important assistance. The prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 253 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court has scheduled a debate hearing for today (30th) and has appointed six volunteer lawyers, Zhang Baopei, Lu Longxiang, Ye Renzhou, Zheng Wenwang, Tinggan Qianjin, to appear in court to defend. The court opened at 10:00 a.m. this morning, with Judge Li of the Criminal Court presiding. The prosecutor appeared in court to prosecute. The interrogator called each bandit in turn for interrogation. The confessions were mostly evasive or admitted to being conscripted as boatmen, forced to row boats. The statements differed greatly from those made during the investigation. But their ferocious appearances were revealed in their eyebrows. However, because there are many bandits, it took all day to interrogate them one by one. At 5:10 p.m., the judge announced a ten-minute break before resuming the interrogation. After the interrogation, it was heard that the debate was over and a sentence would be pronounced immediately.</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>The Kidnapping Case at Jinhui Bridge is Solved. Last month, the family of Qian Guiqiu, a farmer in the 17th Tu of the 15th Bao in the Sixth District, had their eight-year-old grandson kidnapped by bandits. After receiving the report, the County Public Security Bureau, in addition to ordering the family not to privately negotiate a ransom, dispatched Inspector Chen Jinfang to Shanghai to assist in the investigation. It is now known that the bandits, seeing the strict security checkpoints, did not dare to insist. So they secretly abandoned the little hostage in a certain room of the Tianchan Hotel on Haining Road, to escape. Inspector Chen learned of the situation and, on the 25th of this month, joined forces with the local police station to rescue the child. The child was handed over to the family for identification yesterday.</p>
<p>The Excitement of Autumn Festival Commercial Auctions This county has suffered from years of scarcity, and commerce has been greatly affected. Fortunately, this year's flower and rice harvests are abundant, and the market is active.

Among them, the silk and satin and foreign goods industries are particularly prosperous.</p>
<p>Nantang River Works Committee Holds Meeting The Nantang River works in Nanqiao have caused complaints and lawsuits due to local dissatisfaction. So County Chief Shen convened the original Nantang River Works Committee yesterday to discuss solutions. The committee members expressed their opinions, agreeing that the project depends on the weather and is difficult to complete by human effort. However, the various accounts should be thoroughly audited, and the cases of continuing to collect river donations and repaying interest on loans should be discussed separately. Otherwise, relying on a single reimbursement form will be difficult to convince people. It has been decided to form another audit committee for further review.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Captain Du Dies of Serious Injuries: Du Jingwu, Acting Captain of the 14th Water Police Team of Wujiang, was sent to the city for medical treatment after being attacked by bandits. Mr. Du died of excessive blood loss at 10 p.m. on the 29th at the Bo Xi Hospital. It is reported that when the bandits attacked the team headquarters, they divided into two groups. One group surrounded the patrol boat in front of the team headquarters, and the other went to the headquarters, captured the guard, silenced him, and then went around to the back of the house. They fired guns from the window at Du's bed. Du was awakened from his dream and got out of bed to take his Mauser pistol and fired back out the window while calling the city for help. Eventually, he was shot four times by the dense bandit fire, and his bullets ran out. He crawled into the small courtyard behind the house to hide. The bandits saw that the gunfire in the house had stopped and rushed in to search. They found no one, so they took more than one hundred silver dollars and two Mauser pistols from the clothes chest. Four police officers were injured on the patrol boat, and more than ten guns were robbed.</p>

Sun Jiquan was captured in the Yingqiao area and immediately arrested and sent to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Henan Refugees Disturb Wuxi: Recently, cases of unrest and robbery have emerged one after another, and the villagers are uneasy. Unexpectedly, at about 10 a.m. yesterday, more than 300 Henan refugees suddenly arrived at Zhongqiao Town in the Third District (Yangming Township). After arriving in the town, they forcibly demanded food from residents' shops. If they were not satisfied, they threatened and beat the villagers. Some of the refugees even held wooden sticks, bamboo poles, and other objects and rushed to the home of Chen Zhizhen, a doctor in the town, and carried out a large-scale robbery. Clothing and cash worth about one hundred yuan were robbed. Chen Zhizhen reported this to the Xiajiabian Public Security Eighth Branch, which sent police to suppress the situation and expel the refugees.</p>
<p>Selling His Wife for a Price and Falsely Accusing an Honest Man of Theft: Jin Arong, a native of Changzhou, lives on Guangqin Road outside Guangfu Gate in this county and makes a living by selling duck blood soup. His income is very meager, and he is extremely poor. Recently, Jin Arong found it increasingly difficult to make ends meet, so he painfully sold his wife, Ms. Mou, to Xu, a resident of Suzhou, to be his wife. At that time, the price was set at 130 yuan, with half of the price paid in advance. Unexpectedly, after Jin returned to Wuxi from Suzhou, Liao Dajin, the leader of the detective team of the county police brigade, learned that the money was of dubious origin and ordered his detectives to take Jin to a teahouse and accuse him of being a thief who robbed sweet potato boats. He was threatened in every possible way and subjected to torture. As a result, Jin paid 50 yuan to be released. Jin had no choice but to go to Suzhou again and ask the Xu family for the remaining half of the price of his wife, 65 yuan. Together with the previous 20 yuan, he had a total of 85 yuan, which he hid in his felt hat and took a car back to Wuxi. Unexpectedly, Liao Dajin sent his detectives to arrest him at the detective office and still accused him of being a thief. He was tortured with private punishment. Jin could not bear the torture and had to falsely confess. After Liao obtained the confession, he immediately presented it to the brigade headquarters. Yesterday, Brigade Commander Wang personally interrogated Jin Arong and learned that he was indeed an honest citizen who sold his wife due to poverty and was not a thief. Furthermore, Detective Team Leader Liao Dajin dared to use private punishment and falsely accuse an honest man of theft, which was extremely illegal. It is planned to submit a report to County Magistrate Pan for review.</p>

<p>Police and Bandits Clash at the Border of Wucheng: In Huangcun, about five or six miles from Longhutang in Wuyi County, there was a local defense corps. Due to the Xu Zixiang case last year, it was disbanded without a formal announcement, leaving dozens of firearms behind. Recently, bandits led by a high school student mistakenly heard that government police were coming to confiscate the weapons. Some of the bandits declared to the villagers on the night of the 28th that the firearms must not be handed over to the government police. They then went to the homes of Ni Maohai and Xu Guirong and confiscated three or four Mauser pistols. The Xishiqiao defense corps and the local police team learned about this and inquired that the bandit's secretary, Zhang Lupan, was hiding in Huangshu Village. They went there at dawn on the 29th and arrested him. When they escorted him to Huangcun Town, more than a hundred bandits suddenly came, each holding firearms and displaying military banners. They surrounded the police team and opened fire, causing a fierce exchange of gunfire between the two sides, resulting in deaths and injuries on both sides. Fortunately, police reinforcements from Shizhuang, Qiuzhuang, Ligang, and other areas arrived and continued the battle for two hours. The bandits were unable to withstand the pressure and fled westward. After investigation, it was found that Liu Quande on the bandit side was injured and fell to the ground, and Qian Zhengyuan, a shop assistant, was also shot and injured. Several police officers were injured, and several others were missing. This morning (30th), Cheng County dispatched another team to pursue and suppress the bandits.</p>

They divided into two groups and surrounded Huangcun. At about 6 a.m. yesterday (29th), they opened fire with the bandits. Because they were outnumbered, they were surrounded. Bugler Lai Desheng was the first to be captured. Police officers Deng Yuqing and Zhao Guangqian, Cao Jitang (brother of Cao Zongduo, the district chief of the Eighth District of the Sixth Branch), and Zhao Jinyu and Geng Sangui of the Ligang Defense Corps are missing, and their life or death is unknown.

<h3>Important News</h3>
<p>President of National Jinan University</p>
<h3>Zheng Hongnian Wishes to Specialize in Overseas Chinese Education</h3>
<p>Submits Resignation from Political Deputy of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>Zheng Hongnian, President of National Jinan University, submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan yesterday, requesting to resign as Political Deputy of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and wishing to specialize in overseas Chinese education. The original submission stated,</p>
<p>In order to earnestly request permission to resign as Political Deputy of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, so as to devote oneself wholeheartedly to overseas Chinese education. Hongnian has been entrusted with a simple promotion and held a position as Political Deputy of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Although he has worked diligently, he is ultimately ashamed of having made no achievements. Upon recalling the overseas Chinese education that he advocated and founded twenty-three years ago, the mission has not yet been completed, and he is vigilant day and night, always concerned. In the spring of the sixteenth year, when the National Revolutionary Army settled in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the various schools were suspended, and the music was temporarily stopped. The students of Jinan School requested Hongnian, who was the director when the school was established at the end of the Qing Dynasty, and who had used the nationalism revealed by the Premier's Tongmenghui as the meaning of the school song and set it as the educational policy, to take charge of the school administration. Hongnian advocated organizing a school affairs maintenance committee and recommended Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, Cai Yuanpei, and Hu Zhantang as committee members. Hongnian also intended to humbly occupy a seat and jointly plan the progress, and proposed a candidate. After several negotiations, the students all hoped for Hongnian. Hongnian's eldest daughter had just completed her studies and died prematurely, and his mood was bad, so the matter was abandoned and not discussed. The family did not let Hongnian know about the students' repeated requests. This was a polite refusal. Later, he learned that the students had gone directly to the former Central Education Administrative Committee to request that a receiver be sent first and then a principal be appointed. Public and private matters were intertwined, and Hongnian, although he himself judged that his talent and virtue were not worthy, dared not not reluctantly take on the arduous task. On June 14 of the sixteenth year, he arrived at the school to take over the matter, and thus, based on his long-held aspirations, reorganized the school affairs plan and reorganization, striving to improve the level of overseas Chinese children to adapt to the special environment overseas, hoping to academicize it and enable overseas Chinese elders to achieve freedom and equality, and not allow a part of the entire Chinese nation to be assimilated outside the territory. Over the years, there have been some achievements, and people in society have often praised it. Now the university has reached the beginning of the fourth academic year, with more than twenty departments in five colleges, and the scale is roughly complete. The middle school has also been reorganized and is improving day by day. However, the school is still in the process of improvement. Recalling the past three years, I was trapped in economic storms and constant winds and rains. In addition, Jinan is in a special situation, because the middle school and the single-subject university were reorganized by Hongnian into a complete university, which is completely different from the schools that have been established and have rules to follow. Various constructions require funds everywhere. Special equipment has only received warehouse receipts for 300,000 yuan, and the actual cash is only more than 250,000 yuan. Other schools receive the same treatment, and it is not only Jinan that is favored. At the beginning of Hongnian's tenure, he first cleared old debts and reissued arrears, totaling 70,000 yuan. In the seventeenth year, the grade levels were added according to the regulations. From July, expenses were made according to the new budget, but the income remained the same. In addition, the discount was issued, and the subsidy from the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office was stopped. With this increase and decrease, there was a shortfall of 20,000 yuan per month for seven months. Until March of last year, it was possible to receive the new budget. The operation and planning in this were all done by Hongnian in various ways, using his own thin property to mortgage to the bank. He successively added more than ten buildings, including the Science Museum Auditorium, offices, faculty and staff dormitories, and male and female student dormitories, and added school equipment and increased books and instruments. The cost was not insignificant. The old appearance of the school has changed, and the new debts of individuals have been heavily burdened. The debts have reached more than ten million yuan. Hongnian only thought it was for the sake of the school, endured the pain and worked hard to support it. Why is it so old? It is nothing more than recalling the merits of the overseas Chinese in assisting the revolution, feeling the Party-state's entrustment to educate the household, and striving to complete the highest institution of overseas Chinese, to reward the Premier for the overseas Chinese's assistance in the revolution, to comfort the spirit in heaven, and to fulfill the responsibility of a healthy party member, regardless of the pros and cons. Therefore, although he once went to assist in financial management and twice assisted in industry and commerce, it was not necessary. After entering the ministry, he did not spend the 200 yuan per month that he only received from the school. However, he never regarded the school as a side business. Therefore, when he lived in Beijing, the school affairs were always full of letters and telegrams. There were many express packages every day, and there were vouchers to check. The receiving and sending books can also be checked. He also worried that the handling may be negligent. Every Monday and Saturday, he left Beijing for Shanghai to personally handle school administration, discuss school affairs with teachers and staff, always for six or seven hours every day, and attended the memorial week, reporting on the points of improvement at any time. In the past three years, except for attending the Premier's funeral and summer vacation or special events, he has not missed a week to attend the memorial, giving deep instructions to the students. The school publication can be checked. In this way, running between Beijing and Shanghai, traveling in the dust, with his heart hanging in two places, Hongnian's remaining life of worries, whether in politics or education, can be said to be over. He only remembers that he has received special knowledge from the Premier in the past, and is ashamed of not having an inch of repayment. He has cultivated the field of overseas Chinese education, and he cannot continue to cultivate it. Fortunately, the government has decided that university presidents cannot hold concurrent positions. Hongnian, in his foolishness, also deeply believes that education is the fundamental plan of the country, and overseas Chinese education has a special mission. Rejoicing in the opportunity, he humbly wishes to get rid of his official career and devote himself to education. Moreover, he has a historical relationship with Jinan. Once the school base is consolidated and the construction is completed, he will cleanly retreat. He can comfort the Premier and feel at ease in his conscience. He humbly hopes that you will be considerate of his foolishness and immediately submit a proposal to the council to exempt him from his position as Political Deputy of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, so that he can devote himself wholeheartedly to overseas Chinese education, so as to be effective. I am sincerely grateful for your friendship. Sincerely presenting to the Executive Yuan, Zheng Hongnian, President of National Jinan University.</p>
<h3>Flexibility in the Deadline for Registration of Primary Schools:</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, according to a report from the Zhejiang Education Department, issued an instruction from your ministry to clearly define the deadline for registration of private schools at all levels in various places, and ordered them to follow the instructions and report. Upon investigation, private secondary schools in Zhejiang Province that have not been registered have been ordered to complete the registration procedures within the first semester of the 19th year. If the same strict order is issued to private primary schools in various places to register within the deadline, there will be many obstacles in practice. For example, most of the private primary schools in various places are established by rural people or the groups they organize. The villagers are not clear about the laws and regulations. If the deadline is strictly set and registration is urged, it is easy to arouse resentment, reduce the enthusiasm for running schools, or even close down. This is one. According to the current situation, primary school education is far from popular. For private schools, the main thing is to encourage improvement. For private primary schools, it is difficult to use the same strict rules. This is two. Furthermore, the number of primary schools run by local churches is still large, and it takes a lot of time to negotiate restrictions. This is three. In summary, it seems that the deadline for registration of private schools should be handled separately for primary and secondary schools. It is appropriate to prepare a document for reporting, and to request your approval for compliance. The Ministry of Education instructed, "The report is known. The deadline for registration of private schools can be specified separately for primary and secondary schools. Private secondary schools in the province that have not been registered have been ordered by the department to complete the registration procedures within the first semester of the 19th year, and should be handled within the deadline. As for the private primary schools in the province that have not been registered, the department has found that there are difficulties, and all registration deadlines can be appropriately extended. Please follow the instructions."</p>
<h3>Public School Graduation Certificates Can Be Stamped by City and County Education Bureaus</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on a request from the Fujian Provincial Department of Education regarding whether graduation certificates from public schools can be stamped by city and county education bureaus, instructed that graduation certificates from public schools should be approved to follow the regulations for school graduation and completion certificates, specifically Article 4, Section 3, and be stamped by the city or county education bureau where the school is located. This is to be noted and implemented accordingly.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Explains Qualifications of Normal School Graduates</h3>
<p>Chen Baohe, a graduate of the Ba County Normal School, inquired with the Ministry of Education about the equivalent qualifications of a two-year graduate of a public normal school under the old system compared to schools under the new system, and whether they can directly apply to specialized schools. The Ministry of Education replied that, upon review, the regulations for old-system normal schools varied. If the student graduated from a higher primary school before entering the normal school, then two years of study there would be equivalent to completing the second year of junior high school. As for qualifications for entering specialized schools, the regulations clearly state that applicants must have graduated from a public or officially registered private senior high school or an equivalent institution, and must pass the entrance examination. Even the preparatory courses require graduates from old-system middle schools according to the above regulations, this student cannot directly apply to a specialized school.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Restricts Transfer Policies for Government-Funded Students</h3>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Education College Holds Autumn Cocoon Exhibition in the People's Education Experiment Zone</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Education College's People's Education Experiment Zone has been in operation for a year and a half, with every effort made to develop various undertakings in the zone. Recently, recognizing that sericulture is the main sideline for nearby residents, the zone, in order to improve people's lives and revitalize the local silk industry, has specially invited sericulture expert Mr. Miao Zhen to provide sericulture guidance starting this year. He is encouraging families to try raising autumn silkworms, using improved silkworm breeds and new sericulture methods. The general public, seeing the potential benefits, are all happy to comply. The silkworm breeds used are from the Huxuguan Renxu Hall and the Luoshe Great China. The Experiment Zone disinfects all silkworm rearing rooms and equipment for the silkworm farmers. Simultaneously, the Experiment Zone is raising demonstration silkworms to serve as a model for the people, and providing guidance to each household twice daily, morning and afternoon. The silkworm farmers readily accept the instructions of the instructors, and therefore, the autumn cocoon harvest of the guided silkworm farmers this year is particularly abundant, the quality has improved, and the selling price is also high, making everyone happy. It is reported that the zone, in order to encourage silkworm farmers to adopt improved silkworm breeds and improved rearing methods, has specifically scheduled an autumn cocoon exhibition at the Experiment Zone's auditorium for two days starting on the 30th of this month. The cocoons of each silkworm farmer will be assessed and ranked, and displayed accordingly. In addition, various models, specimens, and posters related to sericulture will also be displayed. The zone is currently working on preparations, dividing into groups to proceed. On the evening of October 1st, an awards ceremony and various recreational activities will also be held.</p>

It is hoped that they will be contacted at any time to jointly promote progress.</p>
<h3>A New Contribution to Rural Economic Research</h3>
<p>Professor Buck of Jinling University authored a book on Chinese agricultural economics. Scholars who have studied rural economics in recent years often lament the lack of relevant materials for reference. The Department of Agricultural Economics of the College of Agriculture at Jinling University, seeking to remedy this deficiency, has diligently and assiduously collected and organized such materials for over a decade. For example, Mr. Qiao Qiming's work on population issues and the tenant farming system, Mr. Sun Wenyu's work on food issues, and Mr. Xu Cheng's work on rural cooperation have all been continuous and excellent contributions, and have been highly regarded by scholars. Recently, Professor Buck of the department has published a new work, the content of which is based on the results of a comprehensive survey of 2,866 farm households in 17 locations across seven provinces from 1921 to 1925. It provides highly detailed statistics on land use, farm size, land ownership, the tenant farming system, farm labor, rural population, food consumption, and living standards. The original work is in English, titled "Chinese Farm Economy," and is 500 pages long with numerous charts and tables. All theories are based on numerical data, eliminating the shortcomings of empty and abstract discussions. It is truly an unprecedented masterpiece in the field of rural economics in our country. The exclusive domestic distributor is the Shanghai Commercial Press. The translation is being undertaken by Mr. Qiao Qiming and Mr. Zhang Luluan from the department, and it is reported that the majority has been completed and will be published soon.</p>

<h3>Change of Director for County People's Tea Garden</h3>
<p>Attached Citizen School Now Open</p>
<p>The Tangwan Town People's Tea Garden in the Second District of Shanghai County was established in June of this year, with Gu Yunru appointed as director by the former District Chief Peng Liren. Since its opening, it has been making considerable efforts to guide various activities for the people. However, the site is a converted old-style tea garden, with cramped rooms and inadequate facilities. The new District Chief Peng Zhaotang, recognizing that the people lack proper entertainment venues and are easily led astray, attaches great importance to the People's Tea Garden. In order to improve the facilities, a decision has been made to relocate the garden to a new-style building in the south of the town and to appoint Gu Hongda as director. Renovation is currently underway, and once completed, the garden will be officially opened, no later than the Double Tenth Festival. It is also reported that the attached People's Night School opened on the 28th of this month, temporarily using the Tangwan Elementary School as its location, and the volunteer teachers for each subject have also been appointed.</p>

<h3>Salt Revenue Loans Still Able to Pay Interest on Schedule</h3>
<p>Minister Song's Speech Yesterday</p>
<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen made the following statement to the National News Agency regarding the repayment of salt revenue loans:</p>
<p>It has been a year since I issued a statement regarding salt revenue loans on September 18th of last year. Although the situation has been unstable and exchange rates have soared, the government has raised the necessary funds and paid all items due under the original salt revenue loans before September 30th of this year on schedule. The aforementioned debts due include two types of interest coupons due on April 5th and October 5th of this year for the British-French loan, the June interest coupon for the Hukwang loan (estimated at 140,000 pounds, which exceeds the 950,000 taels of silver strongly allocated to the salt tax under the customs), and three periods of interest coupons due on April 1st, October 1st of the 18th year, and April 1st of the 19th year for the Crisp loan. In September of the 18th year, the government paid two types of interest coupons for the British-French loan, thereby clearing all outstanding interest on these loans. As for the interest coupon due on October 1st of the 19th year for the Crisp loan, it has been scheduled for payment at the end of this year. Therefore, the interest owed on the above two loans in the 16th and 17th years can be fully cleared by the end of this year. After clearing the outstanding interest, the government will devote itself to repaying the outstanding principal in order to clear them in turn. The details of this method are described in the statement issued on September 18th of the 18th year. As for the interest payment due on July 1st of the 19th year for the Crisp loan, because Yan Xishan seized a large amount of salt tax in his jurisdiction and delayed remitting it to the central government, the government was unable to repay it on schedule. At the time, it was felt that a solution might be found by temporarily delaying the July interest payment on one hand and actively urging Yan to hand over the funds on the other. Now, the funds have indeed been remitted to the central government a few days ago. The administration of salt tax has been reorganized and improved by the Salt Revenue Audit Office over the past year, with much progress. The situation has been so unstable, but the salt revenue loans are still able to pay interest on schedule, which is what the Ministry is comforted by.</p>

<p>Fandiwen's Talk</p>
<h3>Yesterday Morning's Reception for Chinese and Foreign Journalists</h3>
<p>Former Belgian Foreign Minister Mr. Paul Hymans yesterday met with Chinese and foreign journalists at the Foreign Affairs Discussion Committee on Avenue Joffre, giving a public talk for about an hour and a half. The following is a record of the meeting:</p>
<p>Mission to China</p>
<p>Mr. Hymans first answered reporters about the purpose of his trip, saying that he was invited by the Academia Sinica as a university professor to come to China to study social movements, political conditions, and so on. His purpose was to learn. He had to clearly state that this trip had absolutely nothing to do with politics. Moreover, his time in China was still short, and his observations were very incomplete. Therefore, he was not yet able to express concrete opinions about his impressions of China. When he was in the North, he was able to contact political figures. Regarding the labor movement, apart from seeing books on the Chinese labor movement in Europe, he has not actually had contact with Chinese workers. He currently has no research or study period on the Chinese labor movement. However, in Beiping, he spent a lot of time studying Chinese art and deeply felt that China's artistic civilization was worthy of great admiration. After arriving in Shanghai, he spoke with friends yesterday and felt that during the revolutionary process in China, although internal wars rose and fell continuously, China's social, economic, and educational undertakings were still progressing, which was also worthy of great admiration. As for Chinese politics, he was unwilling to express opinions, not because the Chinese revolution had not yet succeeded. Cromwell's revolution in England took 200 years to complete, and the French Revolution of 1798 also took 100 years to build a democratic government. The Chinese revolution has been going on for less than 20 years. He saw communist slogans yesterday calling him a running dog of imperialism, which was truly unjust. When he was the Belgian Foreign Minister, he expressed great sympathy for China. He played a role in the return of the Belgian concession in Tianjin to China. When he was Foreign Minister, he was vigorously attacked by the Belgian conservatives. Now that he is in Shanghai, he plans to give several public lectures. The topics and lectures have not yet been determined. He gave lectures in the North on: (1) A comparison between the Second International and the First International; (2) A comparison between the Three Principles of the People and Socialism; (3) The organization of international peace and its guarantee. It is also possible that he will repeat these three topics in Shanghai. Regarding his lectures, although he is the leader of the Second International and the Belgian Socialist Party, his purpose is to conduct theoretical analysis, not to promote doctrines.</p>
<p>European Peace</p>
<p>Mr. Hymans next answered about the future of European peace, saying that the discord between France and Italy was seen by many as a cause for concern about the outbreak of a second world war. He encountered the same question when he was in Japan. However, he firmly believed that there was absolutely no danger of a second world war breaking out in Europe in the near future. When he was at the League of Nations in Geneva, he talked about this matter with Czech President Tomáš Masaryk. The Czech President used an analogy, saying that fire cannot burn without fuel. His meaning was that in 1914, Europe was full of fuel, which caused the great fire of the European War. Now that the fuel has been burned to ashes, there is nothing left to burn, so how can a fire start? That is one reason. Now, without discussing the governments of European countries, but speaking of the people of Europe, it can be said that no one does not hate war. Moreover, the military strength of the nations is evenly matched. If they want to start a war, they must first win over and organize alliances to break the balance of power. However, this is impossible in the near future. Therefore, although the authorities of some countries occasionally make dangerous remarks, they are just bluffing and do not actually dare to risk the world's condemnation by starting a war with no certainty of success. French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand once declared that as long as he is in office, he will never allow war to happen. That is the second reason. Furthermore, there are now two major forces in Europe, democratic politics and dictatorial politics, competing with each other. If the forces of democracy gain an advantage in the future, there will be no danger to European peace. Conversely, if the forces of dictatorship gain an advantage, then the future of European peace cannot be easily predicted. However, he is confident that the current dictatorial politics are a reaction to the European War, and the future of Europe will inevitably be the world of democratic politics. It can be predicted. Perhaps the victory of the far-right National Socialist Party in the German elections will cause problems for the overall situation in Europe. He believes that this is also a temporary phenomenon. Moreover, the National Socialist Party once held a dominant position in the German parliament in 1924, but no major changes occurred at that time. However, if the German National Socialist Party rises to form a government, there may be some implications.</p>
<p>German-French Relations</p>
<p>Mr. Hymans was asked about Germany's attitude toward the Treaty of Versailles, whether it would demand revision, cancellation, or fulfillment. He replied that most people in Germany hope to revise the Treaty of Versailles through political and diplomatic means in a friendly manner, and have no intention of resorting to force. The German representative made this statement at the Locarno Conference in 1925. As for the Western European border issues stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles, such as the return of Alsace-Lorraine to France and the recognition of Belgium's complete independence, the Locarno Treaty confirmed these two points. Germany also recognizes these two points as established facts with no room for revision. Because the Treaty of Versailles had the drawbacks of the victorious countries forcibly presiding over the defeated countries, the Locarno Treaty was negotiated by the German representative based on the diplomatic policies of former German Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann, with free will and without objection.</p>
<p>League of Nations</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Hymans spoke about the League of Nations and Briand's European Union plan, saying that the League of Nations takes the attitude of the participating countries' governments as its attitude. If the representatives of the participating countries belong to the Conservative Party, it is difficult to expect them to seek benefits for small and weak nations. If they are progressives, they are more likely to take care of the welfare of small and weak nations. As for Briand's European Union plan, all countries have expressed agreement in principle. However, due to the different nature of each country's government, they each have several reservations about the European Union plan. He acknowledges that this plan is ideal, but fears that it will be difficult to become a reality. As for the saying that there is a Fourth International organization in Europe, he has never heard of it. It may be an organization of the Italian Socialist Party contacting socialist parties in other countries.</p>
<h3>Grand Banquet at the Tahua Hotel Last Night</h3>
<p>Last night, representatives from various organizations held a public banquet at the Tahua Hotel. In addition to Mr. Hymans, those present included Central Committee members Li Shizeng and Cai Yuanpei, former envoy to Belgium Wang Jingqi, Zheng Yuxiu, Chen Shiguang, Liu Yunfang, and more than a hundred representatives from various organizations. It was a very grand banquet celebrating Sino-Belgian friendship. Mr. Cai Yuanpei presided over the meeting and delivered a welcoming speech, saying, "Today, the Academia Sinica, together with various organizations in Shanghai, welcome Mr. Paul Hymans and his wife. We are deeply honored by the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Hymans. Modern sociological theories, since the era of economic revolution, have gradually studied, improved, or manufactured natural materials to serve the world in the second half of the 19th century. As a result, industry has developed rapidly. If we want industrial development, we must unite labor and capital. In theory, both labor and capital should help each other and harmonize to seek the happiness of all mankind. However, the reality is often not the case. Sometimes there are minor conflicts between the two sides that can be resolved immediately. Sometimes the problems are complex and even lead to disputes, leading to bloodshed and war. Therefore, sociologists have devised ways to improve the treatment of workers, either by enacting laws or by forming organizations. Recently, there has been an organization of international labor groups to seek the happiness of workers around the world. The number of workers who benefit from this fact is in the tens of thousands. The completeness of its organization and the magnitude of its responsibility can be imagined. All of this is planned by a small number of sociologists, and Mr. Hymans is one of the most effective and important members. China's social situation is slightly different from that of other countries. China is currently in a political revolution, similar to Europe in the 1830s. At that time, all the states of Europe underwent major political reforms. After a few years, they gradually became stable and entered the era of economic revolution. The economic revolution occurred, and the problem of capital and labor arose, leading to various complex and unfortunate events. Labor-capital disputes in Europe will inevitably occur in China in the future. After the political revolution in China, an economic revolution will inevitably occur. Once there is an economic revolution, there will inevitably be the same complex social problems. All of these cannot be resolved at present. At present, general economic panic has spread to all countries in the world, and the number of unemployed people has increased rapidly. According to statistics, there are 2 million unemployed people in the United Kingdom, 4 million in the United States, 3 million in Germany, and 400,000 in Japan. The actual causes are nothing more than the following two points: (1) Overproduction: there are more manufactured goods than buyers; (2) Each country has its own self-defense tariff law. The purpose of the self-defense tariff law is nothing more than to reduce imports from other countries, but the exports of the country do not increase. The number of unemployed people therefore increases accordingly. Regarding the second cause, Mr. Hymans advocates using international reciprocal tariffs to alleviate the situation. As for the first cause, each country must find its own solution, but the best method has not yet been discovered today. From the above-mentioned various problems, it can be seen that the social movement of a country changes with the economic situation. Before China reaches the era of economic revolution, how should we study the various labor-capital disputes that have occurred in Europe over the past few decades and the current situation to learn from? Now that we have the guidance of Mr. Hymans, we may hope to solve China's future labor-capital problems in advance. This is what my colleagues and I deeply hope for. I hereby represent the various organizations in China to express our sincere welcome and raise our glasses to wish you good health."</p>
<h3>Opening of the 7th National Anti-Drug Week</h3>
<p>Today is the National Day of Shame for Anti-Drug Use</p>
<p>Delegate Assembly to be Held this Afternoon</p>
<p>The long-planned 7th National Anti-Drug Week has been jointly prepared by party and government organs at all levels, groups, anti-drug branches, and anti-drug propaganda associations in provinces, cities, and counties across the country and will begin today. In Shanghai, all parties have enthusiastically joined the preparations. The following is a summary of the anti-drug week, which has attracted attention both at home and abroad and has become popular throughout the country:</p>
<p>The purpose of this session: The scourge of opium and all narcotic drugs is the main cause and result of China's failed diplomacy and frequent internal strife, weakening the national structure, creating social chaos, withering party businesses, and impoverishing people's lives. The association witnessed great difficulties and initiated anti-drug efforts to eradicate domestic opium and stop foreign drugs. Since 1924, a National Anti-Drug Week has been held every autumn to awaken compatriots to rise up against drugs. Since its implementation, it has lasted for six sessions, and the news has spread and aroused the whole country. This year marks the seventh session. Looking around at the darkness of the environment, we feel the greater the responsibility and the greater the hope. We deeply hope that compatriots across the country will swear with the utmost sincerity, make persistent efforts, and complete the anti-drug campaign to eliminate all drug scourges. The future of the party and the country depends on this. Please, compatriots, encourage each other.</p>
<p>Preparation process: For this Anti-Drug Week, the Anti-Drug Association of the Republic of China sent letters to party and government organs at all levels throughout the country and overseas Chinese communities, asking them to jointly prepare with anti-drug groups in advance. Those preparing to hold activities this time include more than 400 cities and counties in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Henan, and Shandong. Overseas areas such as Singapore in Southeast Asia are also preparing to hold activities.</p>
<p>Measures for the Day of Shame: Today is the first day of Anti-Drug Week. The meaning, purpose, and measures announced on this day are as follows: (A) Meaning: Opium is the main cause of unequal treaties. For more than 80 years, China's diplomacy has failed, its internal affairs have not been rectified, bandits have been rampant, and traitors have been rampant, all due to the scourge of opium. How can we not express a deep sense of shame and humiliation for this great humiliation that has caused great pain, so as to awaken the public to fight together? Therefore, there is a Day of Shame for the Anti-Drug Week to awaken compatriots to wash away this great humiliation. (B) Purpose: As the saying goes, knowing shame is akin to courage. The movement of the Day of Shame for Anti-Drug Use is intended to make the general public have a deep understanding and thorough awareness of the opium aggression conspiracy and various policies of the imperialists, and to have the determination to eliminate it and move forward courageously to achieve the purpose of shame. (C) Measures: 1. Party organs, groups, schools, at all levels shall hold anti-drug lectures, recite Sun Yat-sen's anti-drug testament, lecture on the history of opium's harm to the country, and the anti-drug mission of the people. 2. Newspapers and magazines shall issue special publications and carry more news about anti-drug use and the significance of this session, so as to awaken the public. 3. Local public anti-drug groups shall carry out anti-drug propaganda and send personnel to various districts to give lectures. 4. Groups shall hold oath-taking campaigns and actively promote anti-drug monthly publications and various anti-drug publications. (D) Outline of propaganda for the Day of Shame: Today, China suffers from the scourge of opium, which has led to rampant bandits, repeated famines, withered industries, and impoverished people's lives. To trace the source and investigate the root cause, there is no one who does not recall the history of opium's entry into China. The entry of opium into China began with the Opium War between China and Britain in the late Qing Dynasty. First, the British seized the trade privileges of the Portuguese in East Asia, and then transported opium produced in their territory of India to China in large quantities to harm the bodies of our people and absorb the money of our people. By 1836, the British had smuggled more than 20,000 boxes of opium into China, worth as much as 17,904,248 taels of silver. In 1839, Lin Zexu ordered the prohibition of opium in Guangdong and burned tens of thousands of boxes of British opium. As a result, conflicts broke out with the British. The British government then sent a large army to attack the seaports of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Zhili. Our army was defeated, and as a result, the British were compensated with more than 20 million taels of silver for the value of opium and military expenses, which led to the beginning of unequal treaties. From then on, the British did their best to poison the Chinese people. Since then, the people have become poor and the country has become weak, and the situation has deteriorated. Other countries have followed suit and used various unequal treaties to implement their policy of letting the scourge of drugs run rampant. China is under the power of the great powers and can only be slaughtered and bullied. In recent years, the import of morphine, heroin, cocaine, etc., which are far more harmful than opium, has increased even more. The annual import from foreign countries reaches more than 80 million taels, and the financial loss has been tens of millions of yuan, and the harm suffered by the people is even more difficult to estimate. In addition, foreigners have set up factories in China to manufacture morphine and sell it to our country.</p>

<p>All over the country. In addition, concessions are the center of opium trade and the general base of drug indulgence. Overseas Chinese living in various colonies are subjected to the opium scourge of the local colonial governments. The evidence is clear and cannot be concealed. They are implementing their opium monopoly policy to increase income, raise the army and navy, and consolidate their position, at the expense of the interests of millions of overseas Chinese. Their perverse acts are outrageous. In order to prevent the attack of fair world opinion, they declare in various countries that Chinese people's addiction to opium has become a natural nature, thereby deceiving the world and concealing their ugliness. For example, the International Opium Conference is postponed indefinitely to avoid our country's questioning, and an unfair Far East Investigation Group is organized specifically to expose our country's shortcomings. All of this is heartbreaking to say. Today's anti-drug campaign is an important plan to save the country and strengthen the race. At this time when foreign aggression is rampant and the scourge of drugs is rampant, we should pay attention to the following points: (1) Strive to abolish unequal treaties. The various facts of losing power and humiliating the country that China has suffered for a hundred years are marked by the scourge of opium. Therefore, if we want to seek fundamental remedies, we must strive to abolish unequal treaties. The import of opium and drugs is entirely supported by unequal treaties, which are used to promote its conspiracy to poison China. Today, we are advocating the anti-drug campaign in order to gather the strength of compatriots across the country to attack this unbreakable unequal treaty and strive to achieve the goal of silencing it. (2) Secondly, strive to realize the proposal to limit the manufacture of drugs in the world to the extent necessary for scientific use. The great powers regard our country as a drug market, and the whole world knows it. Today, the reason why our country's livelihood is bankrupt and its national power is in danger is actually given by the great powers. We have already reached the point of being unbearable to watch. Unexpectedly, in recent years, in addition to exporting opium to China as much as possible, various countries have even manufactured drugs in large quantities, such as morphine and heroin, and tried every means to transport them to China to poison our country. There is nothing more inhuman and unreasonable than this. After the launch of China's anti-drug campaign, we advocated a proposal to limit the manufacture of drugs and made appeals to the international community in an effort to achieve an early conclusion. However, the speakers were earnest and the listeners were contemptuous. Not only have the drug manufacturing plants in various countries not decreased, but they have also been increasing day by day, and the harm our country has suffered has also been increasing. This is what my colleagues and I are deeply concerned about. The most urgent plan at present is to resolutely revitalize ourselves, strictly and vigorously eliminate the planting, transportation, sale, and smoking of opium in the country to stop the mouths of foreigners, and then expose the truth of the great powers' scourge of China, so that they have nowhere to hide, in order to seek international justice. (3) Overseas Chinese are suffering from the scourge of opium. Colonial governments use this as an important source of tax revenue and disregard the lives of hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese. At this critical moment, if we do not quickly seek remedies, we will not stop until the race is destroyed and the country is destroyed. Overseas Chinese have now launched an anti-drug campaign, and there are already many who are engaged in organizing. This phenomenon is enough to promote the early death of the great powers' opium policy. I sincerely hope that overseas compatriots will unite and thoroughly strive for the anti-drug campaign to complete the scourge of drugs that has not stopped for a hundred years, and the country's economy and people's livelihood will benefit immensely.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony: Today at 2:00 pm, the opening ceremony will be held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Various groups and organs in the city, as well as enthusiastic comrades, have been invited to participate. Invitations have already been sent out, and celebrities have been invited to give speeches. The opening declaration is specially recorded as follows: Today is the opening day of the 7th National Anti-Drug Week. Looking back on our past struggles and looking at the current situation of the spread of the scourge of tobacco, what kind of feelings will arise? Today, there is a shortage of food and high rice prices, which have not been seen for decades. In the northwest provinces, famine is imminent, and starving people are everywhere. The tragic situation of the people cannot be described in words. There are many reasons for this. Opium is actually the cause of all this. The warlords in the Northwest not only forced farmers to plant tobacco in order to collect heavy taxes, but also forced the chambers of commerce to buy soil in order to facilitate sales. The tobacco seedlings in Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangxi are all over the place. Farmers refuse drugs and are fined for neglecting donations. This is an unprecedented event, seen under the blue sky and white sun. In the provinces of Fujian and Anhui, they are secretly transported to the capital. Beside the ban, tobacco flowers are in full bloom. What is more contradictory than this? The authorities in Wuhan sell opium and collect special taxes. According to reliable statistics, there are only 536 rice shops in the city, but there are as many as 764 soil shops. Ships come and go, openly transporting goods, and the prohibition law is swept away. In the North China area, heroin is prevalent, and smokers die in two or three years. The authorities are busy with political infighting and have not even taken care of it. Even the army is addicted, accounting for the majority. Shanghai is the general base of opium. Major cases have been cracked repeatedly, but none have been investigated. Now there are even red pills, which are hundreds of times more poisonous than opium, all over the place. As for foreign anesthetic drug factories, there are more and more of them, and the number has reached more than 130. The main market is our country. Of the 20 million taels of Persian opium that were exported last year, 80 to 90 percent entered our country. Overseas Chinese in the Nanyang Islands are addicted to opium, and the colonial government encourages them to collect huge taxes, regardless of the lives of hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese. The opium used annually is actually more than 19 million taels.</p>
<p>China, a country with poor people and exhausted resources, can no longer bear this scourge of internal and external aggression. If this harm is not eliminated, the chaos of politics, the violence of soldiers, the withering of industry, and the impoverishment of people's livelihood will all deteriorate and be beyond repair. We cannot bear to see the people committing suicide, so we must quickly catch up and seek a way to eliminate this harm. We have not been able to overthrow the evil forces behind opium. We should do our best to automatically refuse drugs, first remove our bad habits, clear the harm of drugs in the family, and use the power of the group to clean up the bad habits in society, swear to reject drugs, and never compromise. If we can do this, the demand for opium will decrease, and those who plant, transport, sell, and smoke opium will inevitably change to other jobs. There are government offices that force people to plant tobacco, but there are no government offices that force people to smoke. The fundamental solution is still in ourselves. As the saying goes, people insult themselves, then others insult them. If a country must attack itself, then others will attack it. The scourge of opium is also the same. Therefore, under these circumstances, we should have a fresh awakening. Do not entrust the responsibility of banning opium entirely to government offices. Everyone should make up their minds, and every family should be like this. Recognize that refusing drugs is the right way to wash away national shame, and abiding by the law is a necessary condition for banning opium. When the family is united, we should first remove the bad habit of smoking, strengthen our physique, and never give up smoking. Other measures, such as eliminating tobacco seedlings to stop famine, and stopping anesthetic drugs to protect the health of the race, can then be used to plan construction and make the country rich and strong. This is the significance of this session and the principle of our struggle. The Anti-Drug Association of the Republic of China has gathered anti-drug comrades from all over the country and has fought against the dark forces many times, but the results have not been obvious and the scourge of tobacco is still rampant. This is because the association's responsibility has not been fulfilled and the society's support has not been exhausted. We hope that people across the country will cooperate and not just talk empty words, but do practical things. This is the only condition for the success of anti-drug use and the unavoidable journey of banning opium. We respectfully offer this to the people of the country.</p>

<h3>Sharp Decline in Cotton Production in Various Districts</h3>
<p>Farmers' Economy Feels Even More Difficult</p>
<p>For the past half month, autumn rains and autumn winds have been continuous. It is the time when cotton crops are blooming and budding. Due to the damage caused by the wind and rain, countless flowers and buds have fallen off, and cotton bolls have rotted and fallen to the ground in various districts of the city. The quality is poor, the output has declined sharply, and the farmers' economy has suffered huge losses. The cotton farmers are all worried. This year, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has conducted cooperative cotton planting experiments in the districts of Lixing, Zhenru, Caojing, Pusong, and Yangsi, totaling 39 locations. Some of them have also been affected equally. At present, the cotton crops in various districts have been harvested. The highest yield is about 100 catties, and the lowest is only 20 to 30 catties.</p>
<h3>Agricultural and Mining Ministry Agricultural Product Improvement Discussion Committee</h3>
<p>Established Yesterday</p>
<p>For the purpose of studying and improving various agricultural products in our country, the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines has specially appointed Ye Huijun, Gu Xinyi, Wang Yaochen, Wang Xiaolai, Cai Jiansan, Rong Zongjing, Sun Jingxi, Lu Wenshao, Zheng Chengqing, etc., as well as other agricultural experts, as members of the Agricultural Product Improvement Discussion Committee, and designated Xu Tinghu, Director of the Agricultural Administration Department, Jin Wensi, Director and Deputy Directors Cai Wuji, Yu Qianshan, and Jiang Hanlu, etc., of the Shanghai Agricultural Products Inspection Institute, to also serve as members of the committee. Yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines specially sent Director Jin and Deputy Director Cai as representatives of Minister Yi to host a banquet for the committee members. Except for Cai Jiansan, who did not attend, and Rong Zongjing, who was represented by Wang Yaochen, all others attended the meeting. Director Jin immediately reported on the purpose of the committee, stating that China is founded on agriculture, and improving agricultural products is related to the foundation of the country, a matter of great importance. The Ministry of Agriculture still needs to select and appoint agricultural experts from across the country to discuss together. Therefore, today's banquet is a preliminary reception to exchange ideas, and a formal conference will be held later. He invited everyone to attend, express their great opinions, and contribute to the government. The committee members successively expressed their opinions, and the meeting ended in a joyful atmosphere.</p>
<h3>County First District Office Reports on Disaster and Famine</h3>
<p>Due to various natural disasters in the past, the first district of the county has suffered a famine. Now, the document submitted by the district office to the county government is recorded as follows: Due to frequent natural disasters and poor cotton harvest, it is reported that personnel should be sent to conduct on-site inspections. According to the report from Jiang Yuanbu and others, the head of Qinxiang Township, stating that since the beginning of summer this year, fortunately the weather has been warm and the rainfall has been even, various crops have been able to be planted in time. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of July 3rd, hail fell from the sky, destroying all the cotton seedlings, forming an unprecedented and strange disaster. The officials immediately reported it to your department and forwarded it to the county government, which sent personnel to conduct on-site inspections and confirmed the situation. At the same time, the officials advised and persuaded the farmers to endure the pain and purchase seeds for replanting in order to seek relief. However, when the villagers were replanting, it was already past the planting season, and the development was not as neat and vigorous as before. However, if water and drought were timely and no accidents occurred, then even if the initial loss was significant, it might still be possible to make up for it later. Unexpectedly, from Minor Heat to Major Heat, separated by forty or fifty days, when the cotton flowers and bolls were forming and needed moisture and nutrients urgently, the weather did not rain and suffered a second strike. During this period, the disaster situation was already obvious. However, when the cotton was about to bloom, fortunately, there was a heavy rain, although it was late, there was still hope for a medium harvest year. Unfortunately, heaven did not follow man's wishes, and the continuous rain lasted for ten days, causing the cotton stalks to be steamed by the moisture, and the branches and leaves grew more luxuriantly, while the cotton bolls rotted and fell off one after another. As a result, the harvest suffered a major loss. Now, although it is harvest time, the yield per acre is only about two or three tenths of the normal yield. In the future, the entire harvest will only be about three or four tenths in quality. Considering that rice prices have soared this year and all goods are expensive, and planting in time has already cost a lot, and after the hail damage, replanting has been costly. Now, with no hope of harvest this autumn, what will the small people do for the winter? Therefore, they jointly reported to the district head, hoping that you would consider the difficulties of the people and quickly forward the report to the county government to send personnel to conduct on-site inspections, reduce and postpone taxes, and at the same time find ways to provide relief to alleviate the people's suffering. Based on this, it is believed that the hail this year is a major cause of the disaster and famine. Previously, it was reported to your government to send personnel to investigate and clarify the situation. Later, the weather became flooded or drought, which is also the most important component of the disaster. According to the reports from the heads of various townships, the harvest is only three or four tenths, which is indeed the actual situation. Considering that rice prices have soared this year, exceeding 20 yuan per stone, the villagers have replanted again and again, exhausting their resources, increasing unexpected labor costs, and suffering this ruthless disaster, the people's livelihood is deeply sympathized. In addition to approving the forwarding of the report to your government and jointly planning relief measures with the heads of various townships, the situation of the disaster is reported accordingly, requesting that your government quickly send personnel to the district to conduct on-site inspections, determine the composition of the disaster, and submit a report at each level to request reduction and postponement of taxes, and at the same time find ways to provide relief to alleviate the people's suffering, which is truly in the public interest.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Inspection Institute Approves Registration of Wheat Inventory</h3>
<p>Separate Temporary Registration Measures for Inventory</p>
<p>The Shanghai Agricultural Products Inspection Institute has set October 1st as the start date for inspecting and examining wheat transported and sold in Shanghai in order to eliminate malpractices such as mixing with cement and impurities. The previous report has already recorded this. It is now heard that the institute's investigation shows that Shanghai wheat merchants have stockpiled more than 100,000 dan of inventory. If all of them are inspected, it seems that there will be no difficulties in terms of business sentiment. Therefore, based on the principle that the law does not investigate the past, and adopting the request of Ye Huijun, Chairman of the Shanghai Cereals Industry Association, the inventory transported before October 1st will be allowed to be registered, and no fees will be charged. Six temporary registration measures are specially formulated as follows: (1) All wheat inventory arriving before October 19th, 19th year of the Republic, will be allowed to be temporarily registered. (2) The registration date is from October 1st to October 5th. After the deadline, all will be treated as new goods and handled in accordance with the interim measures for inspecting wheat. (3) The registration location is the reporting and inspection office of this institute and the reporting and inspection branch office in Nanshi. (4) The applicant for registration shall fill in each item on the registration form prescribed by this institute and submit it to this institute together with the bill of lading to obtain a temporary registration certificate. (5) After obtaining a temporary registration certificate, when shipping goods, the institute shall be notified one day in advance to obtain a temporary pass for export or entry into the factory. The validity period of this temporary pass is set at two days, and it will be invalid if it expires. (6) If the quantity of the wheat inventory applying for registration is found to be inconsistent, or if new goods are used to impersonate inventory, etc., they will be punished in accordance with the regulations. The above articles have been officially notified to the Shanghai Municipal and Hansan Cereals Associations, respectively, to be forwarded to the wheat merchants for compliance.</p>
<h3>Wu Song Rice Industry Workers Left Stores Yesterday</h3>
<p>The workers of the entire Wu Song town's rice industry, due to the request of the capital to fulfill the conditions set by the Workers' Union, submitted a request to the Eighth District Party Department through the Wu Song District Branch to convene the capital to send three representatives to attend the district party department meeting to resolve the matter. The capital did not send representatives to attend the meeting, and the labor believed that the capital deliberately delayed and refused to fulfill the conditions. Therefore, yesterday, all the town's workers were convened to go to the district party department for a meeting. Yesterday morning, after the workers left the stores, no one supported the store affairs. Only the store owners maintained the market by themselves. Yesterday was the end-of-month settlement date, and there were no collection staff to collect rice accounts from the public. However, the remittances from various money houses and upper lines were urged very urgently, causing the owners of various firms to be very anxious. It is heard that the labor held a meeting and demanded that the capital agree to fulfill the conditions, otherwise they would have to wait for the resolution before they could enter the store to serve. It is estimated that there is no hope of a satisfactory solution today. The notice from the Rice and Grain Association and the notice from the Workers' Union are recorded below: (1) Notice: For urgent notice matters, it is now reported by the various firms of this association that the workers' union of this industry will hold a members' meeting at 7 am on September 30th. When the time comes, all colleagues will go to attend, and business will inevitably lack support. How should it be handled? Based on this, it is found that the workers of each firm should be allowed to leave the store to attend the members' meeting. As for business, it is hoped that the store owners and managers will temporarily support it to maintain the people's livelihood. This is hereby notified, Wu Song Rice and Grain Industry Association. (2) Notice: For notice matters, the Shanghai Rice Industry Workers' Union issued a letter stating that the Wu Song District Branch Executive Committee's request to fulfill the conditions was submitted to the Eighth District Party Department's Civil Training Committee for approval. After three convocations of representatives from both labor and capital to negotiate and proceed, the capital has repeatedly pushed back and delayed, and has not attended the meeting to negotiate earnestly, deliberately refusing to fulfill the agreed conditions, and destroying the agreed conditions. The cooperation between labor and capital in Wu Song is impossible. The capital uses stubborn means to deceive the workers, and it is obvious that it refuses the difficult and arduous requests. The branch should be aware of this and immediately convene a members' meeting to discuss methods and solutions to deal with it and extricate themselves. Approved. It is found that all members of this association in Wu Song have reached the extreme of hardship in their living conditions. The request for negotiation with the capital has resulted in such a result, which is very painful. This special urgent notice is hereby issued, and it is approved that a meeting of all members of the Wu Song Branch will be held in the auditorium of the District Party Department at 3 pm today. At that time, all members must attend. If any members are found to have declined to attend, the most severe warning will be given to emphasize discipline and there will be no leniency. Be sure to do so. The rest of the address is omitted.</p>
<h3>Hengfeng Yarn Factory Workers Gradually Return to Work</h3>
<p>At the Hengfeng Yarn Factory in Yangshupu, this city, on the 21st of this month, more than ten people, including weaving machine craftsmen and female supervisors, held a meeting outside and made some requests. They did not have earnest consultations with the factory beforehand, and a part of the machines were subsequently on strike. This time, the weaving machine craftsmen had submitted a request to the Municipal Civil Training Committee for assistance, but the Civil Training Committee rejected it because the procedures were not legal. Now, after investigation, the weaving machine craftsmen have gradually returned to work on the 27th. As for the female workers, it is expected that they will also be able to work as usual soon.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Civil Training Committee Reprimands the Yarn Factory Industry Workers' Federation</h3>
<p>The Mass Training Committee of the Executive Committee of this city yesterday issued an instruction and reprimanded the preparatory committee of the Yarn Factory Industry Workers' Federation for overstepping its authority by allowing Liu Hongxing and other workers' representatives from the Dafeng Yarn Factory to prepare to organize a trade union without first submitting it to the Party Department for approval. The instruction stipulated that the Preparatory Committee of the Workers' Federation and instructor Xu Shaochuan should not be allowed to engage in such unauthorized behavior in the future. The original text of the Municipal Civil Training Committee's instruction is extracted as follows: "Report on submitting a report that Liu Hongxing and other workers from the Dafeng Yarn Factory have requested to organize a trade union, and the preparations have been ordered to proceed. A special report is hereby submitted for review and registration." The submitted documents have been received and understood. It is found that the association's authority is only responsible for guiding the trade unions in the industry, and it has no right to authorize the preparations for organizing and stopping the activities of various trade unions. In the past, it had repeatedly issued instructions and reprimanded the workers for organizing a trade union and stopping the activities of the Dongya Flax Bag Factory's trade union, and strictly ordered the association's instructor Xu Shaochuan to be on record. This time, they dared to allow the workers of the Dafeng Factory, Liu Hongxing and others, to prepare a trade union without authorization, which is extremely absurd and frivolous. It is similar to repeatedly violating discipline and overstepping.</p>
<p>The authority is really incorrigible and should be reprimanded. The request is not approved, and it is hoped that there will be no such behavior in the future. If it is committed again, it will be severely punished without leniency. Respect the order and do not violate it. This is of utmost importance. The original documents are returned, this order.</p>
<h3>New Cigarette Tax Regulations Implemented Today</h3>
<p>Abolishing the Seven-Level Tax System</p>
<p>Implementing the Three-Level Tax System on a Trial Basis</p>
<p>The new three-level tax collection regulations for the unified cigarette tax formulated by the Ministry of Finance have been approved by the Executive Yuan and will be implemented starting today (the 1st) for a three-month trial period. At the same time, the old seven-level tax collection regulations will be abolished. The new three-level tax system is divided into the following tax levels: Level 1, 220 yuan; Level 2, 56 yuan; Level 3, 32 yuan.</p>
<h3>Opposing Water Rate Increases</h3>
<p>The Special District Citizens' Federation of this city, which opposes the water rate increase in the concession area, has organized a special committee and resolved to send a letter to the Real Estate Association to advise it, saying, "To the Director: The case of the one-quarter increase in water rates in the Public Concession has been protested by your association, striving to cancel the increase and alleviate the burden for the citizens of the special district. Your enthusiasm and determination are commendable. Although the water company has sent a letter inviting your association and the Chinese Taxpayers' Association to select representatives to audit the accounts together, your association has taken a solemn attitude and rejected the request. Our association expresses its sympathy for this. According to reports, the company invited to audit the future budget, and the previous business reports were not involved. It can be seen that the company's intentions and methods are intended to exploit. If we let them exploit the citizens, there will be no survivors. Our association, as a group of citizens in the special district, has the responsibility to relieve the suffering of the citizens. After discussion by our special committee, no matter what the outcome of the audit, our association will always insist on the original plan to oppose the increase in prices and make further proposals. Water prices must have a certain standard and must not be calculated according to the amount of rent. The water fee income has exceeded several times the increase in rent over the years. According to social practice, all public utilities should not be for profit, and the price should be reduced to a considerable low rate to be fair. We should reply with the case and ask your association to check and notify all members to adhere to the end and not to sign a contract with the water company to increase the price. You must know that going your own way will offend the public, and that harmonious cooperation will achieve complete success. I hope you will work hard to move forward without worrying about difficulties. Our association is willing to be a backup."</p>
<h3>Japanese Acting Representative Protests Match Monopoly</h3>
<p>Claiming Conflict with Washington Treaty</p>
<p>Raising Protests to Prevent Implementation</p>
<p>The case of Swedish match merchants previously requesting the national government for the match monopoly in China has been opposed by Chinese match industry merchants and industry and commerce circles in various places by letters and telegrams. Yesterday, it was learned that the Japanese representative to China, Shigemitsu Aoi, claiming that the Washington Treaty stipulates that foreigners must not occupy the monopoly in China, if the Swedish merchants reach the goal of monopoly, not only will the Japanese match industry's business in China be fatally hit, but also violate the Washington Treaty, which is a major international issue. Therefore, he has formally prepared a document to protest to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to prevent its implementation, and has telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions.</p>
<h3>Zhu Maocheng Resigns from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>The report that Zhu Maocheng submitted a request to resign from the position of Director of the Labor Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce last month has already been noted in the previous report. Later, he was promoted to Counselor by the Ministry and has been officially announced, but Zhu still submitted a resignation request as follows: "The report is that I am short on wisdom and talent, and I sincerely request to resign. I, Maocheng, have been serving society in the past, focusing on implementing the enhancement of the intelligence of the common people and improving the lives of workers. In April of the 17th year of the Republic of China, I was undeservedly promoted to the Director of the Labor Department, and I often have the strength to do what I want internally and externally. Yesterday, I resigned from the position of Director and was promoted to Counselor, and the expectations are still very high. However, with my short wisdom and talent, I find it difficult to bear the responsibility of assisting and contributing. In the future, if I am criticized for failure, it will be a burden on the discerning. It is better to resign from the position of Counselor and specialize in the practical work of improving society in the field. If I can achieve my strength in the future, I will sincerely report it. All the reasons for the petition to resign from the position of Counselor are stated in the document, and I respectfully request your review and approval."</p>
<h3>Xujiahui Security Corps Handover</h3>

<h3>Zhabei's Lights Went Out Last Night, Turning Into a Dark World</h3>
<p>Generator Loses Vacuum</p>
<p>Temporary Power Supply from the Concession</p>
<p>Fortunately No Accidents Occurred in the Darkness</p>
<p>Normalcy Can Be Restored Today</p>
<p>Last night, the residents of Zhabei once again experienced the life of ten years ago, with dark streets, bleak and dim. After seven o'clock, shops closed their doors one after another, stopping business. The most prosperous Baoshan Road, Datong Road, and Hengfeng Road, etc., were different from usual. The streets were noisy with cars and horses, looking ahead and behind, fearing accidental collisions. From 6:30 pm to 8:45 pm, everyone hoped that the lights would be restored. The telephone of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company rang continuously. Later, after the company contacted the Shanghai Electric Power Company of the Public Concession, the electricity from the concession was input to Zhabei, and the light was seen again for a short time. However, the sudden extinguishing of the lights was not due to the damage of the motor, but because the power plant in Yinhang Township, Wu Song, used a new machine, which had only been in use for two days. The workers were still inexperienced, so they accidentally lost the vacuum. As a result, the lights in the Zhabei area, except for those connected to the Fangpeng on Zhongshan Road, were all extinguished. Even the supply of tap water in Zhabei.</p>
<p>, was slightly affected at first.</p>
<p>The Reason for the Lights Going Out The electricity used in Zhabei was originally purchased by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company from the Electricity Department of the former Public Concession, and then resold to users. Later, the Electricity Department was sold to the Shanghai Electric Power Company, and the electricity was still supplied as before. Until the day before yesterday, the company started using the new machine at the power plant in Yinhang Township, Wu Song, and cut off the live wire for power transmission. On the first day, the electricity generated by the plant was used to supply users, and the results were very good. Until yesterday afternoon around 6:30, when electricity was in great demand, the current suddenly interrupted, and the Zhabei area suddenly became a dark world. At first, it was thought that it could be repaired if there was a slight damage. Who knew that the users had waited for half an hour to 45 minutes, but the light still did not come. After hearing the news, the reporter was afraid that there was something else going on, so he drove to the Yinhang Township Power Plant to inquire. After engineer Chen Wenfu explained the reason for the lights going out, he suddenly realized that there were two Skeda generators in the power plant, each with a power of 10,000 kilowatts. The one currently in use is the second machine. The situation on the first day was very good. At about 6:30 last night, the generator suddenly lost its vacuum and lost its pulling force, and the motor stopped, and the current also stopped. This machine can probably work as usual today.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Dark Zhabei There are two places in Fangpeng, which supplies electricity to Zhabei, one is at Junsong Bridge on Jungong Road, and the other is on Zhongshan Road. The former mainly supplies electricity to residents, such as Baoshan Road and Datong Road, etc., all of which are supplied by that place. The latter has relatively few users. The electricity used by factories near Zhongshan Road, etc., all comes from this Fangpeng. When the current stopped last night, all those belonging to the Junsong Bridge Fangpeng, whether it was electric lights or engines, were all extinguished and stopped. Those belonging to Zhongshan Road were not affected because there was still external electricity. Since the lights went out at about 6:30, the residents of Zhabei felt very inconvenient, because it was not long after the lights were turned on, and most of the households were preparing dinner. As soon as the lights went out, they could only grope in the dark. In addition, tap water was also temporarily suspended due to the current stopping and the motor being affected. With the water and electricity cut off, it was even more panic. The police chiefs of the fourth and fifth districts of Zhabei and all the public security bureaus were deeply afraid that villains would carry out activities in the dark, which would be detrimental to public security. Therefore, they immediately notified the police officers at each post to pay attention to prevention, and ordered the shops to close early to ensure safety. About ten minutes after the lights went out, the police at Post No. 15 on Gonghe Road in the jurisdiction of the Fourth District did capture a bandit with weapons in the dark and took him back to the district office for strict handling. However, during the dark period, the demand for candles and gas lamps was even more than the supply. The most embarrassed were the pedestrians on the road who were dressed in long gowns and carrying umbrellas. The rain was falling, and all around was dim, and they felt very embarrassed.</p>
<h3>Li Mei Road</h3>
<p>Robbery and Injury Last Night</p>
<p>Hongchang Pawnshop Suddenly Attacked by Violent Guests</p>
<p>The Boss Was Puffing Away</p>
<p>Calling for Catching Thieves Resulted in Being Shot and Injured</p>
<p>Detectives Arrested a Bandit</p>
<p>At 9:45 last night, Hongchang Pawnshop at No. 44 Li Mei Road in the French Concession was suddenly robbed, and the owner was shot and injured by the robbers. The loss was more than 2,000 yuan. One bandit was arrested on the spot. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>The pawnshop is very remote Wang Zhaobo, a native of Pudong, 36 years old, has been operating Hongchang Pawnshop at No. 44 Li Mei Road in the French Concession for more than ten years. The scale is very small, but the location is remote and it is extremely quiet at night. Unexpectedly, it was coveted by bandits. At about 9:30 last night, when the pawnshop was preparing to close, three bandits in yellow and cyan raincoats suddenly came in one after another.</p>
<p>Three Thieves Burst in Armed The three thieves pretended to offer pawned items as a pretext to enter the door, pulled out their pistols, forced the buddies to open the gate, and rushed in. First, they drove the five people downstairs to the back of the hall, and then put all the cash in the drawer into the bag. One thief was left to monitor the people, and two thieves took the opportunity to go upstairs. At that time, the old manager Wang Zhaobo was puffing away on the back building, chatting with three relatives and friends. The thieves broke in with guns.</p>
<p>Calling for Robbers Resulted in Being Shot and Injured The owner Wang knew he had encountered robbers, but was intimidated by the power of the thieves and dared not speak out. The two thieves turned over boxes and cabinets, and used iron tools to pry open the wooden box for storing money. All the money in the box was robbed. Just as they were about to leave with the stolen goods, Wang was about to get up and call for catching thieves, and a robber fired a shot, hitting his back shoulder and piercing his front arm. Wang fell down in pain, bleeding all over the bed.</p>
<p>One Thief Fled into a Noodle Shop When the three thieves had obtained the stolen goods and fled out of the door, the store buddies shouted wildly for catching thieves. Nearby police whistles sounded loudly, and a little south of the pawnshop was Huage Nao Road, the residences of Du Yuesheng and Zhang Xiaolin. The bodyguards gathered after hearing the alarm and searched in all directions. A thief saw that the situation was not good, and in his hurry, he cleverly fled into Yongxingguan Noodle Shop at No. 50 next door, hoping to hide and escape.</p>
<p>Detectives Arrested a Thief At the same time, the detectives also rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm. They found the thief's face flustered, and the detectives captured him and took him to the police station. They went to the pawnshop to inspect the scene. The thieves abandoned a six-inch Brown Lin pistol with four bullets in it in their haste to escape. Boss Wang was taken to Renji Hospital by car. It is said that although the injuries were not serious, Wang suffered from hemoptysis, and the excessive bleeding has caused serious damage to his body. The Shanghai community is raising money.</p>

<h3>Further Hearing of You Yaho's Lawsuit Against Her Husband for Bigamy</h3>
<p>You Fails to Appear Due to Childbirth</p>
<p>Yang Xuejiu's Illness Has Not Yet Healed</p>
<p>Zhang Nai Will Return Home Soon</p>
<p>You's Mother Testifies in Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Yang Xuejiu, the principal of a girls' school in Chengdong, was sued for criminal bigamy by Zhang Nai's (Yu Xuelou) first wife, You Yaho, after she married Zhang. Zhang's mother and sister, as well as Yang's mother, were all implicated. Except for Zhang, who is still in Japan, Yang has been brought to court for questioning and ordered to be released on bail. However, when the court reopened, Yang claimed to be ill again and did not appear. The judge ordered her to be brought in. These details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, when the hearing was scheduled to resume, many relatives and friends from both sides arrived at the Second Court of the Special District Court, mostly women, who came specifically to observe. However, the plaintiff, You Yaho, was unable to attend due to her recent joy of giving birth on the 25th of last month and her physical weakness after childbirth, and she is recuperating at Guangren Hospital. Yang Xuejiu also claimed to be ill and did not attend, and lawyer Yan Jiang represented her. The other defendants also did not attend, but You's mother represented her daughter in court. You's mother is old, with gray hair, but her speech is very elegant. According to You's mother, the last time the photographer proved that Zhang and Yang's wedding photo was taken, it was a joint criminal act between the two of them, which has been established. Now, the witness and physical evidence are complete and should be punished according to the law. Judge Cheng asked if there was any other evidence. You's mother replied that there was a lot of evidence, but it was all lost. Moreover, when Zhang Nai was in mourning for his parents, Yang Xuejiu sent a eulogy, and Zhang's obituary also mentioned that he was married. Therefore, Yang actually knew that Zhang Nai was a married man, not a widower. When Yang was detained in the police station, she asked my daughter why she was dissatisfied with Zhang and expressed that she could mediate. This shows that Yang's relationship with Zhang was very close. As for Zhang's whereabouts, he is not actually in Japan. He is probably at his sister's house or in Hangzhou. She requested that he be arrested and brought to justice. My daughter is currently recuperating in the hospital after childbirth, but she has no money and is extremely poor. To support her in raising her child, she should be given financial assistance. This issue concerns the Zhang family's ancestral shrine, so please summon Zhang's mother, Yu Zhangshi, to resolve it properly. Then, lawyer Jiang stated that Yang was indeed suffering from illness and did not intentionally fail to appear. She will appear in court next time. Zhang Nai is also said to be returning to China from Japan. Judge Cheng then ordered the police to strictly arrest Zhang Nai and ordered the guarantor to bring Yang Xuejiu to court. The hearing was postponed for fourteen days.</p>
<h3>Zhu Ziyun Has Gone to Hangzhou for Recuperation After Escaping Danger</h3>
<p>Zhu Escaped for Sixty Yuan</p>
<p>The Bandits in Caihua Lane Are Nowhere to Be Found</p>
<p>The Landlord Couple Is Detained</p>
<p>Each Sentenced to Post a Bail of Three Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>Zhu Ziyun, a throat specialist, was kidnapped by bandits and hidden on a boat. It was not until the afternoon of the 28th of last month that Zhu suddenly escaped. After returning home, Zhu immediately reported to the Harbin Police Station, saying that on the morning of the 20th of last month, he was kidnapped by bandits from his residence at 3151 Zhoujiazui Road and taken to Caihua Lane, 722 Qipu Road, by car. He was dragged into the house, and the bandits sprayed a kind of potion on his face and wrapped his eyes with a towel. He immediately fell into a coma. The next morning at 3:00 AM, he was moved by the bandits to a small boat in Rihui Port in West Shanghai and hidden, with two bandits guarding him. On the afternoon of the 28th, when one of the bandits left the boat to go ashore, he promised the other bandit sixty yuan and was able to escape. The police chief immediately sent detective Zhu Hanbo and detective Yan Shiqing to investigate Caihua Lane, 722. The so-called kidnappers had already fled. However, the landlord of the house, Fei Zhenkun, a Chongming native, and his wife, Zhu, rented out the remaining rooms as a bandit's den, and they also deserved to be blamed. Chinese and Western detectives arrested the Fei couple. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Special District Court, where Judge Ge Zitan interrogated them. Detective Zhu reported on the investigation and said that Zhu's escape, according to his telephone call, was due to promising the guard bandit sixty yuan to be released. The truth is still unclear, and Zhu has not yet appeared in court. Zhu's agent lawyer, Lu Qi, stated that Zhu was overly frightened after returning from the bandit's den, resulting in illness, and has now gone to Hangzhou for recuperation, entrusting his brother, Zhu Zhongyun, to represent him in court. Zhu Zhongyun then stated that on the day of the incident, three or four kidnappers suddenly came to his brother's medical residence, each holding a pistol, dragged his brother out, forced him onto a car prepared by the bandits in front of the door, and drove away quickly. The bandits were all young and wore black short clothes. After his brother was kidnapped, the bandits did not send any words, but before the incident, his brother had received two threatening letters demanding three thousand yuan, which his brother ignored. After his brother returned, he said that although his eyes were covered when he was taken to Caihua Lane and his vision was lost, he could still hear the bandits talking, mixed with Ningbo, Chongming, Jiangbei, and other accents. Fei Zhu and his wife testified that they had only rented in Caihua Lane for two months. The house was a two-story building. The Fei couple lived behind the hall, and the upstairs was intended to be rented out. On the 19th of the lunar July, a man and woman with Ningbo accents claimed to be a couple and came to rent the remaining rooms. The man said his name was Jin and he was in the rice business. They agreed on a rent of twenty yuan per month. When they moved in on the 21st, another man came with them, claiming to be his brother. The man was in his thirties, wearing a Western suit, and had a fair complexion. The person claiming to be Jin had pockmarks and a red complexion and was in his forties. The woman was only in her twenties and had a small square face, also with a red complexion. They moved out at the end of the month. According to the woman, she used to work as a maid in a rice store and became acquainted with this man named Jin. Jin had a wife, and his wife had found out about them and was afraid of causing trouble, so they moved to avoid her. When the two men and one woman moved out on the third day of the eighth lunar month, they did not know where they went. When they lived in their house, they did not see any hostages, nor did they know if they were bandits. Fei Zhenkun's statement was similar to Zhu's. Judge Ge then ordered the two defendants to each post a bail of three thousand yuan. If they could not provide bail, they would be detained separately, and the hearing would be adjourned for further investigation.</p>

<h3>South Shanghai Traffic Connection</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Long-Distance Company on Guohuo Road in Nanshi, Shanghai, has seen its business develop rapidly since the opening of the Shanghai-Minhang route. However, the Nanzhe route across the river, although the roadbed has been built by the Nanhuifengxian Construction Bureaus respectively, the bridges are still being planned and are not yet open to traffic. Therefore, the transportation between Nanfeng cannot be connected with Shanghai-Minhang, which is deeply inconvenient for local merchants and residents. At the moment, gentry and merchants from all walks of life in Nanqiao have initiated the establishment of the Yongxin Steamship Company, purchasing three of the latest type of steamships, which are scheduled to depart from Nanqiao at 7:00 AM every day starting from October 1st, heading to Minhang, and departing from Minhang to Nanqiao in the afternoon. In addition to applying for the protection of the Fengxian County Government's announcement, it has also been agreed with the Shanghai-Minhang Company to connect with long-distance buses each time and issue joint tickets. Therefore, the transportation between South Shanghai is connected in one go, and travelers are praising it.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Filipino Homicide Case Still Pending</h3>
<p>Two More Detained Filipinos Released</p>
<p>The "Great American Evening News" reports that Filipino Tupias, who was detained in the Xiaxiya homicide case, is currently detained in the American Prison. Since the American envoy, Pandi, is on leave to return to his country and will not return to Shanghai until the beginning of January next year, Tu will be held until next spring before he can be questioned. However, the Criminal Court will conduct a preliminary hearing within the next few days, but the date has not yet been determined as the case is still under investigation. As for the two Filipinos who were detained on Sunday, they were released on Monday after being questioned in detail by Inspector Salader and were only ordered to appear in court for testimony at the preliminary hearing. It is also heard that Tu has confessed to the American authorities that he committed the murder, but he repeatedly claimed that Xiaxiya first punched him in the face, and he killed him with a knife for self-defense. However, an examination of Tu's head showed no signs of injury. As for Xia's remains, his family has wired this morning (30th) to approve the burial in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>YWCA to Move to Nanjing Road</h3>
<p>Since Ms. Jin Mao Yunqin took office as the General Secretary of the Shanghai YWCA, she has made every effort to rectify the association's affairs. The first step she took was to rent the entire fifth floor of the new building of the Women's Bank on Nanjing Road as the association's service center, relying on the convenience of transportation to promote the association's affairs. The internal work, such as the girls, family, children, general education, dormitory, labor, introduction, and other departments, are all working hard to improve and strive to meet the needs of society. Moreover, because more and more women in Shanghai are joining the business world, preparations are now being made to seek the development of the four educations for women in the business world. In addition to the Women's Workers' Society on Xiaoshadu Road, the labor department will also set up a women's workers' district and a women's workers' dormitory on Robertson Road. As for the house on Nanjing Road, it will take time to equip it, and it will not be possible to move in until early November. This women's service organization with more than twenty years of history in Shanghai will surely shine with innovation.</p>
<h3>Corpse Found in Fire Site on Zhongxing Road</h3>
<p>On the night before last night at around 10 PM, a fire suddenly broke out at the home of Ge Jinfang at 1 Zhongxingli, Zhongxing Road, Zhabei, and it quickly turned into a prairie fire, spreading to neighboring houses, as many as five or six. However, at that time, most people had already gone to sleep, so they were all awakened from their sleep, hurriedly put on their clothes, and fled barefoot, which was very embarrassing. Ge's wife and seven-year-old son were confused by the smoke and could not escape, resulting in their burial in the fire pit. After the fire was extinguished by the fire brigades of various sections, two scorched bodies were found yesterday during the search of the fire site. The Fifth District Police Department ordered Wang Shaoting, the head of the Second Map, to report to the local court for examination.</p>
<h3>Shi Yuxiang's Case of Inciting a Crowd to Commit Assault</h3>

<p>Further Compensation for the Plaintiff's Losses</p>
<p>Yan Asi hired lawyer Ba He to represent him and sued Shi Yuxiang in the French Court for inciting a crowd to commit assault and being stabbed in the head with a knife, requesting an investigation and compensation for losses. The defendant was also represented by a lawyer. The debate was declared over and the verdict was to be reviewed. Yesterday was the date of the verdict. Both parties were summoned, but the defendant did not appear. Judge Zhu sentenced the defendant to one month in the Western Prison for inciting a crowd to commit assault and stabbing the plaintiff, in violation of the criminal law, to serve as a warning to others. Shi Yuxiang was also ordered to pay the plaintiff 3,000 yuan in compensation for losses and 300 yuan in compensation for the plaintiff's daughter, Qiu Bao.</p>

<p>A Tang, the sixteen-year-old son of a resident surnamed Zhang at 798 Baoxunfang, Shanhaiguan Road, suddenly disappeared at 5 AM the day before yesterday for unknown reasons. The family searched everywhere, but there was no news. He has not returned home as of yesterday. A Tang's parents are afraid that he may have been hit by something and his will is weak, leading him to commit suicide by drowning. Yesterday afternoon, they reported to the Water Police Station in detail his clothing, appearance, and facial features, asking them to pay attention.</p>
<h3>Huangpi Refugees Die of Illness in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than a hundred refugees from Huangpi, Hubei Province, arrived at the Jian Ting Guild Hall on the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Road in Nanshi. After learning about this, the Municipal Public Security Bureau immediately sent police to suppress them and raised funds to send them back to their hometowns separately. However, after the refugees dispersed, one refugee, Wang Laosan, 48, who was left behind in the guild hall, was too ill to travel. He was about to be sent to the hospital, but he died before he could be taken there. The Public Security Bureau ordered the Twelfth District Head to report to the court for collection.</p>
<h3>Record of the Qianyi Hospital Board Meeting</h3>
<p>The Red Cross Qianyi Hospital held its sixth anniversary board meeting at the Yueqiao Commercial Federation on Laobazi Road at 3:00 PM on the 27th of this month. Those present included General Director Chen Bingqian, President Wang Binyan, Directors Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Xiaolai, Qin Runqing, Yu Zongzhou, Zhu Yiqian, Tong Zhonglian, etc. The meeting was held as usual, with General Director Chen Bingqian presiding and Zhu Yiqian recording. President Wang reported on the state of the association's affairs, saying that the hospital specializes in providing medical treatment and medicine. Within the past nineteen and a half years, it has treated more than 300 people with serious bone fractures, more than 500 people with bone fractures, and more than 20,000 people with common diseases. More than 11,000 unregistered people were introduced by various military police groups, philanthropists, and directors. The medical service has doubled compared with last year, and in terms of funding, it has been slightly more spacious since Director Du Yuesheng generously donated 300 yuan per month for rent last year. In addition, the hospital received a total of 9,695.40 yuan in registration fees, hospitalization fees, and donations from various directors and patients who were cured. In terms of expenses, the total expenditure was 10,782.72 yuan, which was not much different from the income. This achievement is all due to the enthusiastic maintenance and loving care of Director Du Yuesheng and Director Qin Runqing, which made it possible. After the report was completed, it was decided by the directors to look for land and build a new hospital in order to expand it, considering that the hospital site had expired and needed to be demolished.</p>
<h3>Tragic Record of a Poor Woman Starving to Death</h3>
<p>The Child Is Taken in by the Station</p>
<p>A woman surnamed Zhang lived on Xinjia Road in North Shanghai. Her husband was sentenced to prison for smoking opium. The woman took her eight-year-old child and wandered outside. She had no money, was sick, had no house to live in, and no food to eat. She slept under the overpass in Xinkangli and starved to death after not eating or drinking for three days. The child was also unable to speak, so his name was unknown. The matter was learned by the Third Section of the Fifth District. In addition to keeping the child at the station, the land guarantee was ordered yesterday to report to the court for examination and to the newspaper for collection.</p>
<h3>Two People Committed Suicide by Swallowing Opium</h3>
<p>Zhou Azhao, the wife of a tailor living at 121 Yinyuli, Baxianqiao, French Concession, was 26 years old and from Ningbo. They had been married for several years and had a very deep affection. However, A's father was addicted to alcohol, and her father was also addicted to opium. Both fathers-in-law lived with A. His wife, seeing that her husband's productivity was weak and the economy was gradually strained, suddenly had suicidal thoughts yesterday afternoon and swallowed raw opium in secret. People noticed and sent her to Renji Hospital for treatment, but she took too much poison and died at 6:00 PM that night.</p>
<p>Liu Dezhi, a native of Shandong, was 24 years old and had been engaged in the flour paper business, often traveling between Yantai and Shanghai. He came to Shanghai from Yantai in June and lived in the Dongjuchang Customs Brokerage on the Bund. Recently, he became involved in gambling dens and brothels, spending more than 2,000 yuan. His capital was gradually strained, and the landlord in Yantai sent a letter urging him to pay the debt. Liu was at a loss and could not find a way to make money. He suddenly committed suicide and swallowed raw opium yesterday morning. Because the rescue was not timely, he died at 7:00 PM that night.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Telecommunications Conference Postponed</h3>
<p>Japanese Commissioners Did Not Go to Beijing Yesterday</p>
<p>Due to Problems Still to Be Discussed</p>
<p>The third meeting of the Sino-Japanese telecommunications negotiations was originally scheduled to be held in Beijing today (1st). The Japanese commissioners, Shigekitsu and Yoshino, were originally scheduled to go to Beijing yesterday to attend the meeting. However, the Japanese commissioners suddenly suspended their trip to Beijing yesterday for some reason. Therefore, the meeting today may not be held. According to news from the Japanese Embassy Office yesterday, the third meeting of the Sino-Japanese telecommunications negotiations has been contacted by the Sino-Japanese commissioners several times. It was originally scheduled to be held in Beijing today. However, because two meetings were held a few days ago, all the procedures and other procedures have been negotiated. This meeting must negotiate the main body of the negotiations. The first step is to negotiate the sea line between Shanghai and Nagasaki. This line is the most important part of the Sino-Japanese telecommunications negotiations and is of great importance. It is not easy to negotiate without a specific plan first. At present, there are still various problems and incidental problems that need to be discussed by the two commissioners before they can be formally negotiated. Moreover, the Japanese commissioners currently have differences with the Chinese commissioners on the fixed position of the Shanghai-Nagasaki line. Therefore, they still need to exchange personal opinions first. Therefore, the meeting today may have to be postponed for a day or two before it can be convened again.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Appeal for Taxing People's Food</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, at the request of the Chinese Merchants' Grain, Oil, and Cake Association and the Guangzhou Rice Merchants' Association, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, earnestly requesting the abolition of food taxes. The two telegrams are recorded below: (1) Please Exempt Hunan Rice from Transit Tax to the Nanjing Ministry of Finance. According to a letter from the Municipal Chinese Merchants' Grain, Oil, and Cake Association, a letter was received from the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Han Produced Grain Industry Association, stating that Hunan rice has never been subject to heavy taxes when it arrives in Hankou. Now, the Hankou Customs is actually collecting Hunan rice transit tax, one yuan per catty, which affects people's food and causes public panic. They requested that the Ministry of Finance be forwarded to order the Hankou Customs to withdraw its order to maintain the people's food in the interior. I believe that the harvest was poor last year, and rice prices soared, making it difficult for common people to support themselves. Therefore, they have ordered foreign rice one after another to provide assistance. The outflow of money is countless. Our country is known as an agricultural country, but there is such a huge loophole, which is not heartbreaking. Fortunately, this year's harvest is abundant, and it is expected that rice prices will become cheaper day by day to relieve the people's plight. However, the Hankou Customs is actually collecting Hunan rice transit tax. It is heard that Hunan Province is the richest rice-producing area, and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the northern provinces and cities rely on it for food. Then, the source of Hunan rice is abundant and has a great impact on the people's food in the north and south. Now, it is heard that the Hankou Customs is actually collecting this kind of transit tax, which amounts to one yuan per hundred catties. Each stone is calculated at one hundred and forty catties, which is one yuan and four jiao. In addition, there are transportation costs, water freight, etc., which increases the cost sharply and makes transportation and sales difficult. Rice merchants will inevitably stop moving forward, so how can Hunan rice be exported? This is tantamount to cutting off the food source for the northern and southern provinces. Last year's poor harvest and soaring rice prices can still be attributed to unfavorable weather. Now, the Hankou Customs is collecting this transit tax, increasing the cost of Hunan rice, which will raise rice prices and lead to food difficulties for the people. Where should the blame lie? In the case of a poor harvest and high prices, the authorities should try to suppress them. The Hankou Customs is levying taxes on Hunan rice because of the abundant harvest, raising its cost and oppressing the people's food. Is this what a benevolent person would want to do? The matter concerns the inland grain, so I dare not remain silent. I dare to forward the situation to the Ministry of Finance and ask you to quickly order the Hankou Customs to cancel the order for the Hunan rice transit tax, so that there will be endless benefits to the common people. I have come here with such feelings. I believe that in recent years, agricultural production has been poor and rice prices have soared, and the people's food difficulties have reached the extreme. However, the Hankou Customs is actually collecting Hunan rice transit taxes during the abundant harvest, amounting to one yuan per hundred catties, creating an unprecedentedly harsh levy that affects the supply of food to the north and south. I am afraid that it will harm the people's livelihood and foster hidden dangers. The facts stated are indeed true, and it is reasonable to telegraph your department and ask you to order the Hankou Customs to exempt the special tax in order to maintain the people's food, which is a truly virtuous act. (2) Please Exempt Guangdong Rice Merchants from Stamp Duty</p>
<p>The original telegram stated briefly that on September 27, representatives Zhang Tiejun and Li Futian of the Guangzhou Rice Merchants' Association and Chen Shuoshi, representative of the Guangzhou Rice and Grain Distribution Industry Association, jointly wrote a letter stating that Guangdong Province has always suffered from insufficient food supply. Recently, grain and rice prices have been rising, and they have to rely on foreign rice from abroad to make up for it. Recently, the gold is expensive and the silver is cheap, and the impact is such that it is difficult to calculate the import of grain and rice. Moreover, it is difficult to resist the sale of foreign ships, and bankruptcy is often heard. Although merchants and residents are trying their best to purchase, the cost is high and the stockpiles are small. In addition, there have been frequent water and drought disasters, and famine is often heard. This is a hidden worry for the future of the Guangdong Province food supply. The government should maintain the people's food and exempt the additional tax on food in order to reduce the burden on the common people. In the old days of the late Qing Dynasty, the import tax on rice in Guangdong Province was generally exempted. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the stamp duty was also repeatedly approved by the former Finance Minister and Governor Hu to exempt rice and grain from stamp duty. Today, the standard of living is increasing day by day, the people's livelihood is deteriorating day by day, and the price of rice is much higher than before. Now, with the burden of stamp duty, the pain is unbearable. Stamp duty is a national tax law, but in order to maintain the people's food, it has been exempted by the government in the past. How can it be re-imposed in the future? Our association and others, for the sake of the people's food, cannot remain silent. We hereby ask your association to verify and earnestly ask you to forward it to the Ministry of Finance to consider the lack of food in Guangdong Province, approve the exemption of stamp duty on commercial documents for grain and rice in Guangdong, in order to maintain the people's food and care for the merchants' difficulties. According to this, Guangdong Province has been suffering from years of disasters and poor harvests, and rice prices have been rising. It has to rely on foreign rice to provide relief. The tax authorities charge stamp duty on the import documents of the foreign rice, which increases the cost and raises the selling price. The impact on the general poor people is significant. Therefore, the former Guangdong Province authorities had a precedent of exempting rice and grain from stamp duty. Now, rice prices are rising more and more sharply. One yuan can only buy six or seven catties of rice. It is appropriate to follow the previous case and exempt the stamp duty in order to lighten the burden. It is reasonable to telegraph your department for verification, approve and order the Guangdong Province finance authorities to continue to exempt the stamp duty according to the previous case in order to relieve the people's food.</p>

<h3>Another Lawsuit Against Hu Yongquan</h3>
<p>Tan Meiying, the wife of Zhao Guangzu from Baoshan, hired lawyer Lu Qi and filed a criminal complaint with the Shanghai Special District Local Court, accusing prostitute Chen Junxia, also known as Mei Fei, of colluding with Hu San, also known as Hu Yongquan, to defraud her of a receipt. After repeated summons, Mei Fei was released on bail of 2,000 yuan pending trial, and Hu Yongquan was arrested and interrogated. It is now learned that Mei Fei has been unable to find a suitable guarantor since being ordered to increase her bail and is still detained in the women's prison. However, Hu Yongquan is in hiding and another case has arisen. Qian Wuquan, a resident of the western suburbs of this city, entrusted Hu last year with a receipt for the base land and the American booklet land deed, asking him to collect the land deed from the China Business Company. The matter has been delayed until now, and the deed has not been collected. Now, the villager has found out that Hu has privately transferred the receipt to his own name, which constitutes an act of embezzlement. He has now hired three lawyers, Jin Yu, Zhang Chongding, and Li Yuan, to pursue litigation and request the authorities to provide relief and compensation.</p>
<h3>Case of a Child Killed by a Car</h3>
<p>Witnesses Testify in Court</p>
<p>Judge Orders Plaintiff to Withdraw and Await Further Inquiry</p>
<p>The eight-year-old son of Mrs. Gao Huang, a resident of Rue Bourgeat in the French Concession, was cooling off in front of her house at 6:00 PM on July 27th when he was negligently hit and killed by a car driven by a Western woman, Mrs. Lapeina Veshuit. The victim's family hired lawyer Fei Xizhen to file a lawsuit in the French Court. The plaintiff, Gao Huang, testified that her son was tragically killed and requested justice. Witness Huang Longqi stated that the deceased was his nephew and was sitting next to a large tree in front of the door that evening, cooling off. Gao was also sitting in front of number 326. He witnessed the defendant's car, driven by a Western woman from west to east, with another Westerner sitting next to her, instructing the driver, which led to negligence. The car ran onto the sidewalk, first knocking down the barber Zhou Jinyun, and then hitting the nephew next to the big tree. He immediately rushed forward to pick him up, but his leg was broken and he was dying. He immediately hired a taxi to take him to the hospital. Witness Yu Hanzhang testified that he was also sitting there cooling off that evening and saw the defendant's car with license plate number 573, a red license plate, driving back and forth on the road. It was driven by a Western woman, with a foreign man instructing her. To avoid a rickshaw in front, the car ran off the road and hit Zhou Jinyun and the child.</p>
<p>The person in the car got out, took off the license plate, and tried to escape, but was stopped by onlookers. Zhou Jinyun testified that he worked at a barber shop at number 328 Rue Bourgeat and was cooling off in front of the door that day. The defendant's car came from behind, first knocking him down and then hitting the plaintiff's child, causing his death. He suffered only minor injuries and was not seriously hurt. The plaintiff's lawyer then argued for a long time. The Chinese and Western judges ordered them to withdraw and await further inquiry and verification.</p>
<h3>Western Woman Injured in Car Accident</h3>

She requested an investigation and compensation for her losses. Rickshaw driver Wu Guitang testified to everything. Sun Housi confessed that he was driving to the Great Bell that day when a tram stopped in front of him. He drove along the side, causing him to hit the rickshaw. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Sun to a fine of 20 yuan or 20 days in prison as a warning. The plaintiff's request for compensation was directed to a civil lawsuit.</p>

<h3>Zheng Xingmin Missing</h3>
<p>Zheng Xingmin, also known as Zhenduo, is 25 years old, from Zhongshan, Guangdong. He has a mother and older brother, and his family is of modest means. He was a student in the third year of the medical department at St. John's University in Fanwangdu. He is usually cautious in his conduct and taciturn. His brother, Yu Biao, works at Citibank in this city and is usually strict in supervising his brother's studies, so Xingmin is still able to study diligently. This autumn, he suffered from a carbuncle and did not start school until September 23rd. Yesterday, his mother went to the school to visit him, but the school staff told her that he had not been attending classes. She became very worried and searched everywhere, but to no avail. She is extremely worried and sick. Her brother is deeply stimulated and has become mentally unstable, spending his days in a daze. As for the reason for the student's disappearance, whether he was subjected to other stimuli or mistakenly abducted by bandits, even his family cannot say for sure.</p>

Also, the temperature in this city for the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday was a high of 73.4 and a low of 64.2. On the same day last year, the high was 78.8 and the low was 58.0.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I read in your newspaper on the 24th and 25th that the Soviet Union is selling goods at reduced prices in the markets of Britain and the United States, especially wheat. This has been exposed by various countries, which are trying to stop it. Washington has banned imports, and the German government in Berlin has also ordered a tax increase. However, America is blaming others, and in the past two weeks, it has sold no less than a hundred tons of Chinese factories, causing rice and wheat prices to be affected. If we do not petition for measures to stop this, our farmers will suffer greatly. Therefore, on the 24th, we sent a telegram to the Party and government agencies in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Shanghai. On September 24th and 25th, the Shen Bao reported that London telegrams said that the Soviet Union was selling goods at reduced prices in various countries, especially wheat. The Washington telegrams also said the same. This is nothing more than an attempt to cause chaos in order to promote its communist policies. The League of Nations Economic Committee and US Senator Vaudie have exposed its conspiracy and are considering increasing taxes or banning imports, which is a very good method. However, America is blaming others, and in the past two weeks, it has sold no less than a hundred tons of Chinese factories. Other countries will inevitably follow suit, causing rice prices to be very cheap despite the abundant harvest in various provinces. The impact is unknown. We have long admired your enthusiasm for agricultural administration and believe that you will make plans early. We dare to ask you to quickly take measures to stop this, so as to avoid hurting farmers due to low grain prices and to prevent the Communist bandits from taking the opportunity to succeed. We pray for this.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Representatives of Farmers from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan residing in Shanghai, Chen Guoxian, Zhang Zhijun, Xu Dajun, Gu Zongcheng, Yang Zixiong, 530 people.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Dismissed with a Laugh</h3>
<p>— Sea Guest</p>
<p>Woman A—Your love with Mr. G is very deep. You two were very passionate. Why have you become cold to him lately?</p>
<p>Woman B—He is unbearable to be around like that. Just because I was affectionate to him, he became very complacent. He became so happy that he'd get fat, and was gradually going to become a big fat man. Therefore, I've cooled him down a bit to make him depressed, annoyed, and thin out. When he returns to his original state, I will be nice to him again.</p>
<p>Chemistry Teacher (asking the students)—Do you know what method can be used to keep milk from going bad and sour?</p>
<p>Student—Teacher, drink it all in one gulp. That way, it will be fresh, will not go bad, and will not go sour.</p>
<p>Customer (after paying the bill, asking the waiter for change. The waiter acts like he can't calculate the amount)—You are too bad at calculations. How can you not even calculate such a small amount?</p>
<p>Waiter—Sir, the customers here are all very generous. After they eat, they always pay twice the amount of the bill and never ask for change. So we don't need to practice calculations.</p>
<p>A—I have made up my mind. If our manager does not take back what he said, I will leave immediately.</p>
<p>B—Did he insult you with what he said?</p>
<p>A—He told me to find another job.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Tan Zuchang</h3>
<p>— Master of Yiyi Cottage</p>
<p>Tan Zuchang, the former chairman of the National Government, suddenly passed away from a stroke. Everyone who heard of it felt sorrow. The newspapers in both Shanghai and Nanjing published detailed accounts of his life. I suddenly remembered a few things and hastily recorded them below. I dare not say that this is a comprehensive understanding of Tan.</p>
<p>Tan's original name was Tingkai. He became a Jinshi after achieving first place in the provincial examination. At that time, printing houses widely circulated examination papers for candidates to study and emulate. Those preparing for the imperial examination almost all had one of these compilations in hand, much like what we call speculation today. Tan's essays were naturally recited by everyone and sung in every household. I still keep this essay to this day. The topic seemed to be from the first chapter of the Great Learning. After the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, Tan served as the military governor of Hunan Province, and then changed his name to Yankai.</p>
<p>Tan was skilled in calligraphy. His style resembled that of Weng Tonghe, but lacked his elegance, while surpassing him in strength. In the past, when he lived in Shanghai, he had many social engagements. Countless people from my hometown asked for his calligraphy, numbering in the dozens. Two years ago, he had a new seal made, marking his works as done after fifty. This shows that even though he was busy with public affairs, his interest in calligraphy did not wane. Who would have thought that this seal would only last two years before his life ended? How lamentable!</p>
<p>One year, I was traveling in Hangzhou and staying at room 53 on the lower floor of the Qingtai Second Inn. Someone who knew Tan told me, "Tan Zuchang has come to seek lodging." I went out to look and saw Tan wearing a regular top hat, a black jacket, and a white shirt, holding a foreign umbrella, accompanied by several friends, going upstairs one after another. It was said that he was about to resume his post as military governor of Hunan. His appearance was not as refined as the photos sold in the market, nor as plump as he is today. Among his friends was a burly man whom people identified as the Minister of Justice, Zhang Yaozeng. I don't know if this is true. That evening, Tan and his party stayed in room 53 upstairs. The noise of their laughter and conversation, the calling of servants, continued past midnight. Unable to sleep peacefully, I left the next morning.</p>
<p>Tan had several poems about miscellaneous affairs in Guangzhou, filled with sadness and passion. Although I don't remember the year, judging by the tone and meaning, they must have been written after the Second Revolution of 1913. At that time, Yuan Shikai was seizing power and heroes were scattered everywhere. The poem says: "Banana trees fill the shade by the wall, banyan trees cover the pond. The spring flowers bloom red on the kapok branches. Coming again to the courtyard, everything is unfamiliar. Only the setting sun seems like old times." Another poem says: "Wearing a hat and sword, I remember raising a cup. At that time, official duties were a warning against neglect. No one recognizes what happened twenty years ago. With tears, I pass Guangyi Hall again." The meaning is implied in the words. Who would have thought that success would come in just a few years? Living in glory and dying in sorrow, as it is now. For someone like Tan, it can be said that he had no regrets.</p>
<h3>Trivial Notes on the Memorial Service for Mr. Yuan Guanlan</h3>
<p>— Cailiang</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan Guanlan of Baoshan was a renowned figure in the educational field. His morality and writings were long admired by the literati. He once worked in the Ministry of Education and made many plans. He was especially known for his achievements in compulsory education. In recent years, he retired to Shanghai, engaging in writing and compiling historical materials. His contribution was particularly great. Unfortunately, he contracted a minor illness last month and suddenly passed away. How could it be that his great work was unfinished and his experience was gone? Thinking of his legacy, I feel deep sorrow. Recently, various organizations such as the Shanghai Chinese Vocational Education Society held a memorial service at the Shanghai South Workers' Education Center. The solemn procession was quite a sight. I will now record what I saw and heard in a disorganized manner as follows.</p>
<p>Dedicated to Education: Chairman Cai Yuanpei began the report, saying, "I had a friendly relationship with Mr. Yuan as colleagues. Our friendship can be described as inseparable. I still remember when I worked in the Ministry of Education, I relied heavily on his assistance. The May Fourth Movement suddenly arose, creating a storm. The Ministry of Education was at the forefront and found it difficult to cope. Fortunately, Mr. Yuan mediated and ran around, tirelessly. The student movement was eventually calmed. Furthermore, the nationalization of Tongji University was achieved after several negotiations. All of this was due to Mr. Yuan's leadership. Later, Mr. Yuan resigned from his position because he was not accustomed to political life and went abroad. He visited advanced countries in Europe and America to study educational reforms. After returning to China, he shared his insights with others. His writings amounted to hundreds of thousands of words, and his words were all to the point. This spirit of diligent study and his dedication to his work are truly worthy of emulation for all time and will be remembered forever."</p>
<p>Admirable Thrift: Mr. Zhang Zhongren continued with a speech, saying, "Although Mr. Yuan held senior positions and important posts throughout his life, he lived very frugally and had no bureaucratic airs. Mr. Yuan was content with simplicity and did not seek fame or fortune, unlike the usual officials who liked to elevate their status, give orders, indulge in their desires. These difficult and chaotic times are not without cause. As the saying goes, 'Thrift can foster integrity.' Look at Mr. Yuan; he can inspire."</p>
<p>Penetrating Insights: Mr. Huang Renzhi concluded with a speech, "For decades, our country's education has lacked effectiveness. Education cannot be integrated with society, which is a serious problem. Every time I see farmers' and workers' children who have received education, they are unwilling to return to their original occupations, leading to increased unemployment and harming society. I have also heard that many members of the Communist Party are students who have received secondary or higher education, which is very worrying for the future of education. I once heard Mr. Yuan had a solution: 'The compulsory education I advocate must first ensure that those who receive education do not abandon their original occupations. Then, they can learn and apply what they have learned, complementing each other. Only then can we be innocent of harming society and achieve the true value of education.' I sincerely hope that those who continue Mr. Yuan's work will reflect on these words."</p>
<p>Eulogies: There were many eulogies from various parties, full of beautiful words. I will record those I remember for my friends. Chen Taoyi's eulogy said, "Living in the world for sixty-five years, donating everything from head to toe, like Mozi. Passing away in an instant, coming and going freely, like Zhonglang." Jiang Weiqiao's eulogy said, "Sacrificing his life for education, alas, it is difficult to live in this corrupt world. Suffering from unwarranted criticism in old age, not suffering from incurable diseases. Who would have expected this person to die suddenly, without even seeing him at the end." Wu Yan's eulogy said, "Educational bureaucrats or educators, right or wrong, can be concluded after death. A warm heart, an ancient way, both honest and kind, as inscribed on the tomb, my words will not change." Shen Enfu's eulogy said, "Despising food and clothing, excelling in officialdom and scholarship, diligently serving the country and managing the family, not only appropriate for offering sacrifices to the community. Laboring hard all his life, dying in poverty, using integrity to inspire the weak, not just satirizing the current talents." Pan Wen'an's eulogy said, "Seeking education to be universal, advocating simple learning. Mr. Meng Jinru, his full of enthusiasm. Treating people with kindness and consideration, serving with hunger and drowning in mind. Responsible for those who die later, all should sacrifice this full spirit." I will omit the rest.</p>
<h3>Still a Dreamer in the Spring City</h3>
<p>— Shuomi</p>
<p>Wandering the world, it has been twenty years. Although I have enjoyed wine and poetry, and sought flowers and willows, the foreign flowers and birds still tug at my heart from time to time. But my temples are gradually gray, and my worldly heart is dead. I no longer have the old ways of a madman. Resting briefly by the sea, surrounded by the stench and noise, I feel that there is no space to pass the time. In my spare time, I only go to the cinema for two hours of entertainment. But it is extremely boring. I still remember those ten years in Beijing, rushing through the pleasure grounds, full of high spirits. How could I have known that there would be today. Not to mention what I have personally experienced, but just the strange sights I have seen and the extraordinary deeds I have heard are both worthy of song and tears, laughter and pity. Sometimes when I think back, I truly feel that strange fun arises. I regret that I am not a novelist and cannot use a vivid pen to describe it in detail for the appreciation of the public. I always consider this a great regret in my life. Since entering autumn, I have been suffering from illness and have moved into the hospital to recuperate. The film, which I relied on as my only source of entertainment, has been temporarily abandoned. The sickbed is lonely, so I read recent novels to pass the time. Yesterday, a friend gave me a copy of the New Classic of Mountains and Seas, a set of five thick volumes. At first, I suspected it was a book of strange tales, but then I saw it labeled as a long social erotic novel and the latest work by Zhang Qiuchong. So I tentatively accepted it and read it. I knew that Zhang was a famous novelist in Shanghai, his works sharp and profound, full of sadism and wildness. I had also heard people say that Zhang was wild and unrestrained in his youth, full of talent and arrogant. His novels cannot be compared with ordinary new books on the market. So I spent three days reading it and finally believed that the pen of a writer is so marvelous that it cannot be measured by ordinary people. The book describes seven romantic figures, prostitutes and actors cunning, officials and their families absurd, warlords and markets. It is dazzling. All the secrets that I have seen and heard, as well as the erotic secrets that I have not seen or heard, are all recorded on paper. It is so wonderful. Sometimes it is beautiful women, sometimes it is bull demons and snake gods, dripping with powder and rubbing with butter, painting dragons and catching ghosts. It fully captures the essence, making the reader sometimes surprised, sometimes happy, sometimes angry, sometimes exclaiming in wonder, sometimes slamming the table and shouting, sometimes feeling as if they are in the book, unknowingly enchanted. It can be called divine skill. The wonder lies in that even the most ordinary little things, once described by the author, become humorous and strange, making people unable to help but laugh. The old dreams of the Spring City are revisited. After reading it repeatedly while sick, I love it so much that I can't bear to let it go. So I write it down to share with my friends.</p>
<p>Editorial Note: The New Classic of Mountains and Seas is my friend Zhang Qiuchong's first masterpiece. Zhang is full of amazing talent and has a great reputation. This book is especially carefully written and extraordinary. The entire book is more than 500,000 words, in five thick volumes, and includes fifty exquisitely colored illustrations by the famous painter Lu Shaofei. The list price is five yuan, but the special price is only three yuan. It is available at the Guanhua Bookstore, Modern Bookstore, and United Bookstore on Fourth Road, as well as the Central Bookstore in the Maijiaquan area.</p>
<p>Publishing News: The Drama Monthly, edited by Liu Gehu of the Datong Bookstore, is the only specialized book on drama in contemporary society. It has been published for two years and has a good reputation. The Mei Lanfang and Shang Xiaoyun issues were especially praised by all sectors. Cheng Yanqiu is an outstanding and eccentric figure in the performing arts, with profound achievements and a talent for creating new tunes. He works in the same field as Mei and Shang but has different styles, each excelling in their own areas. Therefore, it is necessary to publish a special issue. Those who have articles about Cheng to submit to the journal will be paid generously. However, they must be delivered within half a month, as it may be too late to be included. The journal is currently selling short-term pre-orders for Volume 3, with gramophones and records as gifts to enhance interest. The deadline is October 10th.</p>
<h3>Correspondence from Europe (75)</h3>
<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>Pilgrimage to Italy Diary</p>
<p>(2) En Route A</p>
<p>At 10 p.m. on May 29, we departed from the Gare de Lyon in Paris. It was the beginning of summer, and the days were very long. The sun had just set when we started our journey. Accompanying me were Wu Hengqin, Yang Xiutao, Yan Wenliang, and Sun Fuxi. We traveled southeast, passing through Savoia and crossing the White Peak into Italy. In the train compartment, everyone chatted casually about the itinerary and expenses after arriving in Rome. We elected Xiutao to manage the money and Fuxi to keep the accounts. Later, Fuxi became excited and began to talk about his love story with Ms. Chen Xuezhao. He said, "How passionate and sweet we were at first. But in the end, it was misunderstood for some unknown reason. People thought she had abandoned me. But I didn't value her that much. Even if I had wholeheartedly supported her, it would have only been for decoration. Love, romance, where is it? Perhaps sex is not something that exists in the human world. I always feel that women are fragile, fickle, and inevitably vain and confused. Perhaps there are no women worth loving..." So he was prepared not to marry or talk about love. At that time, I also advised him, "Don't be too biased. It can't be generalized. Women may not be so simple. Besides, 'love' is inherently 'imperfect' and there is nothing to expect as a result..." He waited for a while and then said, "Later, Ms. Chen had a misunderstanding with Mr. G. He felt sorry for her and suddenly wrote her a letter. One day in Paris, he started to visit her again, wanting to ask her what happened. Unexpectedly, after meeting, she scolded him, 'You filthy thing. I don't have time to talk to you and I don't have the mood to correspond with you.' She really thought too highly of herself. She not only misunderstood me but also misunderstood herself." I replied, "Misunderstanding is art. Being able to be misunderstood is great. I ultimately believe that we don't need to be understood. It's better to be misunderstood." Fuxi said, "So you suffer. Many people misunderstand you. Only now do I know your character. Ah, from now on, I will also be bold and rebellious like you. Originally, the articles I wrote before, the paintings I painted before, were not my true self. You see, from now on..."</p>
<p>"Yes, we only need to be honest and unpretentious, moving in the direction that our heart wants to move. If you want to swim, you have to tighten your body and jump into the water. We are inherently traitors to tradition and sinners to the world. I cannot perfunctorily compromise. I cannot compromise and follow the old ways. I am a fool who is used to being ridiculed. But I am willing to be a fool for life, following the power of my internal life. The reason why China is the way it is now is because there are too many people with petty tricks and petty abilities. So society has become so frivolous and ungrateful. I think you also have some foolishness. I hope you become a fool. I don't want you to be a rat-like, petty-minded person." This is what I excitedly told Fuxi at the time.</p>
<h3>The Anti-Communist Movement of Finnish Farmers</h3>
<p>— Liu Zeng, residing in Paris</p>
<p>In reality, the existence and activities of these 23 Communist Party members in the parliament cannot create any revolutionary danger. However, the government is concerned that the Communist Party's propaganda will spread further and that a portion of the population will be exploited. In addition, there is also various assistance from neighboring Russia, which will make things difficult for the government. Therefore, it is necessary to actively resolve the Communist Party issue.</p>
<p>The government's attitude towards suppressing the Communist Party coincides with the attitude of the Finnish farmers. There are no large farms in Finland. The Finnish farming class is entirely composed of small farmers. These small farmers tend to be conservative, serious, and hardworking. They are not very concerned about political and social matters, but they are very patriotic. Moreover, the area around Central Ostrobothnia, where the Lapua Movement originated, has a strong religious influence. Communist propaganda is detrimental to religion. Therefore, the prevailing religious ideas in the area further fueled the farmers' aversion to the Communist Party. Furthermore, during the Finnish War of Independence, the majority of the army was composed of the farming class. The farmers shed much blood for their country. Now, they see that the achievements of their bloody battles are threatened with destruction by Communist propaganda. Their patriotic and anti-communist sentiments naturally arise. For years, the farmers have tried their best to tolerate and avoid conflict with the Communist Party. However, their feelings of resentment have accumulated deeper and deeper, just like a volcano about to erupt.</p>
<p>The first place where this volcano erupted was Lapua. Communist Party members in Lapua imitated Soviet Russia. At the end of November 1929, they began to organize various provocative gatherings. The responsible young communists wore red shirts and added Russian Communist Party symbols, appearing arrogant and oppressive. This move greatly displeased the farmers, who decided to rise up and strike at the Communist Party. This is the origin of the Lapua Movement. However, the initial riots were relatively restrained. Although the Communist Party members suffered insults, there were no casualties.</p>
<p>After the Lapua farmers first clashed with the Communist Party, many patriotic organizations were established throughout Finland, demanding that the government adopt strict methods to suppress communism. For a time, an anti-communist atmosphere enveloped the entire country. The name of the Lapua Movement became widely known.</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Markets Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>The trend is moving forward step by step. Yesterday, on the 30th, the gold market situation was extremely sharp, continuing to show a peak, exceeding the 570 taels threshold. The upward trend advanced frequently, and the deinventory was swift. The total turnover for both morning and afternoon sessions reached 16 taels. However, only two or three taels were recorded at the beginning of the morning session. The fluctuations only started in the afternoon, fluctuating between four and five taels. Both the official and unofficial exchange rates showed a strong upward trend, shrinking twice, with each reduction accounting for two price levels. Dealers actively bought, mainly British gold. The floor trading was quite active, with demand exceeding supply. Major players such as Taikang, Runyuanxing, Yongxin, Hengyifeng, and Yong etc. all pursued purchases, with some covering short positions. However, Yuanmaoyong and Hengxing Shunli etc. all sold. It rose high early in the morning, likely due to the fall in overseas silver prices. Afterwards, there was a surge in buyers, and the exchange rate rose, creating a sense of great prosperity. By noon, it had already exceeded 70 yuan. Later in the afternoon, Taikang Runyuanxing, Yongjin, and Yong etc. continued to buy tirelessly, while Hengxing Shunli, Wanxing etc. continued to sell positions. When the market reached its initial peak and then leveled off, it had risen to over 77 yuan. It was mainly due to the tight exchange rate. Therefore, settlement was very active. Afterwards, it suddenly turned lax. As a result, the confidence dropped. There was a sharp drop of five or six taels, a sudden and vast wave. The last price was within 73 taels, mainly because today (October 1st) is a holiday. Small retailers sold off in various ways to break even.</p>
<p>The initial market showed its edge. The November contract rose 1.8 yuan from the morning opening price to 561.8 yuan. Large silver bars shrank by 125, and silver prices went down slightly by half a cent. Afterwards, it became even stronger. Xinhng, Yuanxing, Yongtai, Kangrun, and contended to buy to cover short positions. Therefore, when the first order was announced, it was around 67 taels, and the listed price had shrunk by 25, with the US dollar at half a yuan and the Japanese gold adding 1.5 cents. Then it was added to 7.78 yuan. The wheat merchants absorbed the November British gold at 7 pence and 3125. After a while, it decreased by slightly more than one tael to 66.23 yuan. But the buyers were quite concentrated. Then the December British gold was offered by Sumitomo Chung Wan at 7 pence and 375. Soon it was absorbed into the January 4375 contract. At around 10 o'clock, the price rose to 69.2 yuan. Later, Zhifeng Yongshunli etc. all sold, and the price dropped by slightly more than three taels. But there was a one tael or several qian callback. At 10:50, it was calculated at 65.78 yuan. Suddenly, at 11 o'clock, it rose again, quite colorful. Because the bank's appetite for British gold was still good, and Taikang, Runxinhng etc. continued to buy non-stop, the situation became like a rising storm, reaching five or six taels and breaking through the 70 tael mark. By 11:30, it had reached 71.8 yuan. Afterwards, there was a one-tael reversal, and when the noon market closed at 71.4 yuan, it was re-pulled up by several qian to 72 taels. The disclosed price had been changed to 616.2 yuan, with the listing price increased by 1.5 cents. The initial pressure was around 50 taels, and at noon it was more than 44 taels.</p>
<p>The first order continues to shrink and gradually fly high. The afternoon market opened at 74.2 yuan. This was the afterglow of the noon closing, and the goods opened large. Taikang Run etc. first invested in the market. Afterwards, the sellers became active. From 74.4 yuan, it fell to 3.34 yuan. After 2:10, it gradually flew high, likely due to the fact that the HSBC listing continued to shrink by 25, the US dollar decreased by 5 jiao, and the Japanese gold increased by 1.75 fen. And each number entered. At 2:45, it was 77.5. For the November British gold, each bank sold 7 pence and 125. Afterwards, the December contract was also sold at the same price. At the tightest moment, the November contract only settled at 7 pence and 0625. Afterwards, there were one-tael advances and retreats. At 3 o'clock, it was 77.6 yuan. Suddenly, more than three taels were shed, likely due to the fact that Dalian Bang and Hengxing etc. disposed of their holdings, decreasing it to 74 taels. After a moment, it returned two taels, calculated as 6.67 qian. After 3:30, the exchange market turned lax, especially as Hengxing etc. continued to sell. Wanxing Shunli and retailers sold successively, so the sharp appearance turned to a weak trend. After 4 o'clock, Macgalli also offered the December British gold at 7 pence and 25. It actually fell sharply by as much as five taels. At 4:15, it was 71.4 yuan. The bank price for October British gold was 7 pence and 125. Until 4:30, the closing price was calculated as 72.2 yuan. Compared to the day before, it increased sharply by 12.2 yuan. The maximum price during the day was 77.6 yuan, and the minimum price was 61.8 yuan. There was actually a 15.8 yuan difference, which is also a large number. The disclosed price had been changed to 624.6 yuan, with the Japanese gold listing price increased by 1.75 fen. The estimated pressure was 47 to 52.3 qian. The ledger recorded 75 yuan for October, 71 yuan for November with a water replenishment of 83 yuan, and 84 yuan in the afternoon. The early market price of goods was 62.1 yuan, the noon closing price was 72 yuan, the afternoon price was 74 yuan, and the closing price was 72.8 yuan.</p>
<p>Large households' short-covering situation is tense. The trading volume of each company seeks to be more than the supply. The momentum of large households covering short positions is tense. It is estimated that Xinhng, Taikang Run, Yuanxing Yong, Jin'an, Dadacheng, and Bingxing etc. all have made follow-up payments. Wanxing Shunli, Hengxing, Yuanmaoyong etc. mostly sold. Also, some retailers have sold. Zhifeng Yong, Yu Da, Yuantai, Futai Heng, and Kunhe etc. have entered and exited at times. Yifeng Yong also entered. Tong Taichang has sold more and paid less. In the afternoon, Taikang Run, Xinhng, Yuanxing Yong, and Bingxing all entered. Zhifeng Yong, Yuanmaoyong, and Yu Da have uneven entries and exits. Shunli, Fuchang, Hengxing, and Wanxing etc. all supplied more than they sought. Dalian Bang sold more than 5,000 bars to settle with exchange bills, and bought more than 1,000 bars. Guangdong Bang sold 2,000 bars, also for hedging.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Listings See Repeated Price Increases</h3>
<p>The British Exchange trading is very lively.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver market continued to decline. The market was calm at first and then tired. Because the United States intended to sell silver bars, the exchange rate between British and American currencies was slightly lower, and the Japanese and American currencies remained unchanged. Yokohama and Kobe had no ups and downs. The local foreign exchange market shrunk in the morning and continued to shrink in the afternoon, with a total of two reductions. The initial reduction for British gold was 25, the US dollar was 5 jiao, India was 75, France was 12 yuan, Japan was 1.25 yuan, Singapore was increased by 2 taels, Hong Kong was increased by 25, and Japanese gold rose by 1.5 fen. By 2:30 in the afternoon, the continued reduction was 25, calculated as 1 shilling, 6 pence, and 875, the US dollar was 5 jiao, calculated as 38.25 yuan, India was 1.25 yuan, calculated as 106 rupees, France was 13 yuan, calculated as 974 yuan, Japan was 1.25 yuan, calculated as 94.75 shield, German exchange decreased slightly by 2 yuan, calculated as 160 and a half marks, Singapore increased by 2 taels, calculated as 148 taels, Japanese gold increased by 1.75 fen, calculated as 1 tael, 2 qian, and 9.5 fen, Hong Kong remained unchanged, calculated as 82 taels. The trend of the internal market was also tight. It was firm from the morning and became even stronger afterwards. The afternoon was very profitable at first and then showed a loose trend again. The gold market was quite sharp in the morning, and the market in the afternoon was even higher, reaching over 77 taels, but later it was easily weak, between 73 taels, so the exchange rate was frustrated. Comparing the price with the previous day it's already very tight. British gold shrunk by 3125, the US dollar shrunk by 625, and Japanese gold increased by more than 2 fen. Chinese merchants mostly settled with shillings. There were also those who threw out before the market, with a total transaction of 200,000 pounds. Banks such as Macgalli and Huabi made payments, while Taiwanese Sumitomo etc. sold. In the aftermarket, Dalian Bang and various companies bravely purchased more than 200,000 pounds. East Asia, Taiwan, North China, Zhengjin, HSBC, Macgalli, and Sumitomo etc. all had sales, mostly for hedging. Each bank also did more than 100,000 pounds of mutual transactions, and also did 100,000 to 200,000 US dollars in pairs. Only a small number of Japanese gold was traded, and the market for shillings felt particularly colorful. Large bars of silver still have a shrinking trend.</p>
<h3>Overseas Silver Prices' Declining Trend is Difficult to Reverse</h3>
<p>The United States Intends to Resell</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to London telegrams, large bars of silver were frequently falling. Buyers were watching. The market was flat, but afterwards, the United States seemed to intend to sell, so the market turned soft. Both near and far terms shrunk sharply by 125, both at 16 pence and 625 (equivalent to 1 shilling, 7 pence, and 6875 in British gold). According to New York telegrams, US silver prices also fell sharply, receding into the 36 cent mark, calculated at 36 cents and 875 for spot goods, British to US still at 4 yuan, 8 jiao, 5 fen, 96875, US to British decreased by 03125, calculated at 4 yuan, 8 jiao, 6 fen, Japan to US is still 49 and a half yuan, British to Japan is still calculated as 2 shillings, 046875. British Shanghai shillings shorted by 125, calculated at 1 shilling, 7 pence, and 75. Bombay spot goods were reduced slightly by 7 anna, calculated as 47 rupees and 05 anna. Also, today at 10:25 a.m., Reuters telegram arrived, the Japanese to US ratio was 49 and a half yuan, the British to Japan ratio was calculated as 2 shillings and 040625. Also, at 9:10 a.m., the Dentsu News Agency came, and there were no ups and downs. The near-term Japanese to US in and out prices were 49 yuan, 4375 to half, the British to Japan in and out prices were 2 shillings, 040625 to 4375, the far-term Japanese to US in and out prices were 49 yuan, 3125 to 4375, and the British to Japan in and out prices were 2 shillings, 034375 to 40625.</p>
<h3>Sharp Drop in Foreign Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>Heavy Settlement at Month's End</p>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday morning, the foreign exchange rate suddenly plummeted. The main reason was the significant influx of foreign silver from various ports the day before and on that day. Furthermore, a large amount was expected to arrive daily thereafter, which immediately suppressed the market. People's confidence also weakened accordingly. Therefore, the difference between the morning and afternoon foreign exchange rates yesterday was as much as three cents. The rapid and sharp decline was quite alarming. As for the silver and money businesses, it was near the end of the month, so various settlements were exceptionally heavy, and there was no time for detailed investigation.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuation (Foreign Silver): The morning exchange rate was 73.2125 per mille, a sharp drop of 2.75 per mille compared to the previous day's afternoon market. The afternoon market continued to fall by 0.25 per mille, to 73.1875 per mille. If arrivals from various ports continue, the market price is feared to be unsustainable. (Silver Exchange): The morning silver exchange rate was 7%, the afternoon rate 3%, a decrease of half or more compared to the previous day's market price. The market sentiment was soft again, so the premium for adding water was only 2% to 3%, and bank quotations had no market.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: Jiangnan small coins were 65.5 per mille in the morning and 65.3 per mille in the afternoon, with a difference of 0.1 per mille compared to the previous day's market price. The trading volume was 11,000 jiao in the morning and 7,000 jiao in the afternoon. Guangdong small coins were 64.025 per mille in the morning and 63.95 per mille in the afternoon. The trading volume was 195,000 jiao in the morning and 140,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins remained at 387 cash, with a trading volume of over 34,000 strings.</p>
<p>Silver Inflow and Outflow (Silver): Bank settlements yesterday were exceptionally heavy due to it being the end of the month. The procedures overwhelmed them, and there was no time for detailed examination. Moreover, due to time constraints, early forecasts were not possible, so they are temporarily omitted. Money shops and silver firms' settlements were also too large to estimate. It was only heard that remittances from various routes exceeded 1.5 million. (Foreign Silver): Remittance drafts traded 2.03 million in the morning and 963,000 in the afternoon. Banknotes traded only 20,000 in the afternoon. Off-market banknotes traded 153,000 in the morning and 44,000 in the afternoon. Bank trading was 550,000 interbank in the morning and 500,000 interbank in the afternoon. All settlements for bank foreign currency accounts and money shops' foreign currency drafts were omitted due to the overwhelming procedures. However, it was heard that in addition to the usual 240,000 from Hangzhou, other ports, hearing of the high exchange rate in Shanghai, rushed to ship cash to Shanghai. Arrivals from various ports yesterday totaled no less than 2 million, which suppressed the foreign exchange rate. As for the banknote exchange transactions made by small firms, they still amounted to 800,000 to 900,000, but the market turned quiet after digestion.</p>
<h3>Money Shops' Banknote Settlement Delayed by One Day</h3>
<p>Money shops usually settle their accounts daily, but due to the unstable situation and the prevalence of robberies, it was decided to change the settlement to the 2nd and 26th of each lunar month, canceling the usual daily settlement. After the adoption of the Gregorian calendar this year, the settlement days were changed to the 2nd and 16th of each month. However, due to the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, which falls on the 1st, the settlement on the 2nd will be combined, inevitably making it exceptionally busy. Therefore, there is a proposal to delay it by one day. The announcement from their association is recorded below: To our esteemed colleagues in the North Market, regarding the collection and payment of banknotes, it has been decided that the 2nd and 16th of each lunar month will be the settlement dates. Since the adoption of the Gregorian calendar this year, the 2nd and 16th of each month will be the settlement dates. It was proposed at the second regular meeting on March 26th, 18th year, that the settlement of banknotes on August 16th coincides with the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, resulting in accumulated settlements. Accountants and warehouse staff often make mistakes due to being rushed. It was proposed to change the settlement to the 17th, which was previously decided. This year, it is tentatively set that October 1st is the Mid-Autumn Festival. The settlement of banknotes on the 2nd also coincides with the holiday, similar to the previous case. The settlement of banknotes on the 2nd should be changed to the 3rd to avoid errors. As this concerns industry regulations, this is specially announced for your information and compliance, etc. It is heard that the Market Committee also agreed that this time the settlement on the 2nd will be handled on the 3rd, and the settlement on the 3rd will be combined and handled on the 4th. Delaying it by one day will allow for a more relaxed and unhurried process, avoiding errors, etc.</p>
<h3>Securities' Disbandment Bonds Rebound by One Yuan</h3>
<p>Other bonds are also slightly firmer... Market closed today.</p>
<p>Today, the Securities Exchange is closed for trading because the financial industry in this city is closed for the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday. Regarding the market situation of various public bonds yesterday, only the "Disbandment" and "7th Year" bonds were traded on the spot market, while other bonds had no transactions. Trading in the futures market was still active. The trend of bond prices was quite stable in the morning. Although the market was active, the supply and demand were balanced, with little change. In the afternoon, the selling pressure weakened, and the buying side remained active, so the prices rebounded uniformly. As a result, the "Disbandment" futures contracts rose back by one yuan compared to the previous weekend. "Customs" and "Disbandment" futures each rose by six or seven cents, while other bonds also rose by four or five cents. The total transaction volume of spot goods for the whole day was only 18,000 yuan, including 15,000 yuan for "Disbandment" and 3,000 yuan for "7th Year" bonds. The futures volume was 5.67 million yuan for both the morning and afternoon markets, with "Disbandment" accounting for over 5 million, "Disbandment" 3.26 million, "Customs" over 1.4 million, and "19th Cigarette" also over 1.1 million.

<h3>Slight Slackening Trend in Yarn and Cotton Markets</h3>
<p>Today, Yarn Trading is Closed for the Mid-Autumn Festival Holiday</p>
<p>The yarn market is slightly sluggish, mainly due to the unfavorable global situation, which has softened market sentiment. However, some manufacturers remain confident and exert strong pulling force. Currently, the yarn market is still difficult to stabilize and remains volatile. As for the Chaozhou merchants, their intention to sell remains strong, so the struggle between the bulls and bears is intense, with both sides having considerable strength. Currently, yarn sales are still good, and future steps should be taken according to actual needs.</p>
<p>Declining Futures and Late Closing for Cotton Futures: Cotton futures opened in the morning with consecutive declines in US cotton prices for two days. Retail investors were bearish, with slight declines of three to four cents for each month. The second and third boards rebounded because major players held firm. As a result, the near months fell by three to five cents, while the far months rose by one to two cents. In the afternoon, due to the market closure tomorrow, the market sentiment suddenly relaxed, and sellers increased, with declines of seven, eight, nine cents to one or two cents. It was found that 1,100 bales were sold by Rongxing, 650 bales by Maoji, 750 bales by Jifeng, 600 bales by Hanfeng, and 650 bales by Dafeng, with the rest ranging from 300 to 550 bales. 2,000 bales were bought by Tiancheng, 650 bales by Yiyu, and the rest ranging from 250 to 550 bales. The total trading volume for the whole day was 15,400 bales. The closing prices of cotton futures are recorded below:</p>
<p>Cotton Futures Price: Increase/Decrease, Existing Account Balance, Closing Price, Increase/Decrease, Existing Account Balance</p>
<p>October: 1528, Down 1, 232,1501</p>
<p>November: 1529, 1141, 1502</p>
<p>December: 1528, 937, 600</p>
<p>January: 1528, Down 8, 328, 850</p>
<p>February: 1530, 922, 350</p>
<p>Current Demand Still Not Bad: Current yarn sales are still good. It was found that various groups bought 2,152 bales of spot goods, 1,400 bales of futures, and 500 bales were traded among peers. The market was stable. Among the customer groups, Sichuan bought 1,160 bales, Guangdong 1,240 bales, Yunnan 548 bales, Xuzhou 75 bales, inland areas 250 bales, Luzhou 40 bales, Hankou 210 bales, and miscellaneous groups 85 bales.</p>
<h3>Calm and Stable Cotton Market with No Changes</h3>
<p>The cotton market is calm, but the decline in US cotton prices is uncertain. This kind of image is rare in the past. Measuring the situation, the one-cent threshold may be difficult to maintain. However, people's confidence in this city is still firm, mainly because the bulls are holding tight. Because the inland supply is not strong, and the purchase price is high, the existing cotton factories have no intention to do anything. Because they bought a huge amount of Indian and American cotton at very low prices, the position of the local cotton has been occupied by foreign cotton early on. The current market situation is in a precarious position.</p>
<p>Morning Relaxation and Slight Activity in the Afternoon for Hankou Cotton: The Hankou cotton market opened in the morning, and retail investors were bearish because the US cotton price continued to decline. However, the selling pressure in the market was not strong, with declines of five cents to one cent for each month. In the afternoon, due to the purchase by Shenchang, the market sentiment was tighter, with a slight increase of five cents. The total trading volume for the whole day was 41,500 dan. Shenchang bought 6,100 dan, Tiancheng 2,800 dan, and Jinfeng 2,300 dan, with the rest ranging from 800 to 1,000 dan. Lichang sold 4,000 dan, Tianchang 2,900 dan, and Yuanda 2,800 dan, with the rest ranging from 1,000 to 1,700 dan. The closing prices of Hankou cotton are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hankou Cotton Closing Price: Increase/Decrease, Existing Account Balance</p>
<p>December: 3225, Up 5, 97,000</p>
<p>October: 3220, Down 1, 581,600</p>

<p>January: 3230, 599,500</p>
<p>February: 3230, N/A, 65,000</p>
<p>Factory Demand Quiet and Difficult to Change: The current cotton business is quiet, and factories have stopped purchasing. The supply of Yao cotton is 1,200 bales, and Tong cotton is 400 bales.

<h3>Frequent Declines in Overseas Cotton and Yarn</h3>
<p>Strong Selling of Southern US Cotton: Yesterday, US cotton was soft due to unfavorable Liverpool telegrams, weak sentiment in Wall Street, and selling of southern US cotton. Futures fell by 13 to 21 points, and spot goods fell by 5 points. UK cotton futures fell by 8 or 9 points, and spot goods fell by 7 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by 10 points. The Indian cotton market was firm, and brokers bought in. Pingguoer fell by 2 rupees, and Aomula and Bailuoxi fell by 3 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below: (29th telegraph)</p>

<h3>Grain and Foreign Rice Orders to Arrive</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival and sales of customer Xian rice were balanced, and the market remained stable. Only the local gang was active, and no customer gangs inquired. Fortunately, the number of arrivals recently is not large. Except for some Jiangxi rice, Xiang rice is blocked by taxes and bandits and has not continued to arrive. Therefore, the market can still stand slightly. Yesterday's transaction was 400 bags of Jiangxi machine late rice at a price of 12 yuan to 11.80 yuan, and another 500 bags of machine early rice at a price of 11 yuan to 10.04 yuan, Xiang rice 850 bags, at a price of 9.55 yuan to 8.80 yuan. It is said that there are about 30,000 foreign rice orders, and the first batch is expected to arrive in port today or tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Grand Delivery of Flour in September</h3>
<p>411,000 Bags Delivered by Local and Foreign Manufacturers and Warehouses</p>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery of September futures flour. The delivery volume for the whole day was proportional to the season of new flour. Because the inventory of each factory was not abundant during the new flour season, and wheat was not cost-effective, the deliveries at the end of the month were automatically taken back. Therefore, the futures delivery of the exchange seemed to be just a formality. In September, due to the quiet sales to customers and the smooth arrival of wheat, the production of each factory increased invisibly. However, the major bulls, fearing excessive losses, were unwilling to settle at any time. The factories felt that they had to wait for the inventory to be sold, and they felt that there was no need to hedge the inversion of the market. Not only the small and medium-sized factories in this city are in this situation, but also those who joined the standard from foreign ports have delivered warehouse receipts, which shows that the abundance of inventory is undeniable. The total delivery volume for the whole day was 411,000 bags. It is heard that China's Green Three Stars are 77,000 bags, Fuxin's Green Battleship is 1,000 bags, Xinda's Green Cannon is 90,000 bags, Xinda Xinda's Green Cannon is 42,000 bags, Huafeng Green Wheat Root is 58,000 bags, Jiufeng Green Mountain Deer is 20,500 bags, Fufeng Yutong's Red and Blue Car is 116,500 bags, and Tailong Green Eagle Ball is 5,000 bags. It is said that the receiver is still a major customer, and there are few customer gangs. The total futures transaction volume is 9,589,000 bags.</p>
<p>(Unit: Thousand Bags)</p>

<h3>Wheat Imports to Begin Inspection</h3>
<p>Factories Suffer Hidden Losses Due to Poor Quality Goods</p>
<p>Applying for Inspection is Essential</p>
<p>Total Inventory in Shanghai Reaches Over 300,000</p>
<p>All Subsequent Imports Must Undergo Inspection</p>
<p>The Shanghai Agricultural Product Inspection Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, considering that the quality of agricultural products has a great relationship with the livelihood of farmers and the needs of society, has learned that there are many flour factories in this city, and the annual purchase of wheat from foreign ports is very large. Local vendors and inland traders often have the bad habit of mixing mud and debris for petty profits. Without inspection, it is impossible to promote the improvement of agricultural products. It is heard that the office has prepared for this inspection and decided that from October 1st, all imports by train, ship, or boat must be inspected by the office before they can be sold. If the goods are of poor quality, they will be returned in a row and will not be allowed to unload. As for the wheat previously in storage, the director of the Miscellaneous Grain Association, Ye Huijun, has agreed with the office to limit the registration from the 1st to the 5th by the traders themselves for consideration. Therefore, the quality of wheat products after this will be a new look.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market with Dumped Goods and Upward-Trend Dutch Red Sugar</h3>
<p>Sharp Decline in New York Sugar Futures</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegrams: The Cuban spot sugar price was 1.03125, a slight drop of 0.0625 compared to the previous telegram. The New York sugar futures December price was 1.01, the next year's March price was 1.11, and the May price was 1.18, each falling sharply by five points compared to the previous price. The Java spot sugar price was 8.375, down 0.1875. The futures October price was 8.125, also down 0.0625, and the November price was 8.125, rebounding by 0.0625. The market opened by the association was quiet, and transactions were sluggish. However, the foreign exchange rate rose, but sales were sluggish, so the market sentiment remained weak. Dutch sugar, grade 24 coarse sand white new goods, was priced at eight taels, and there were few buyers. Fine sand white was 8.05 taels, and the market was stable. Dutch red sugar was still trending upward. The price for grade N goods was 6.575 taels, and the sellers were also lacking. Japanese sugar N mark was 8.05 taels, J mark was 8.175 taels, TM mark was 7.7 taels, and TK mark was 7.9 taels. The inflow and outflow were also slack, and the market was weak. There was a sale of dumped Dutch sugar, with Jicheng foreign company selling 1,000 bags of grade 10 Dutch red sugar to be shipped in October at a price of 4.9 Dutch currency, a new regulation plus tax, which was still selling well. The price of Guohuo Mianhu red sugar in the number plate market opened at 8.4 taels for 30 bags, and 8.5 taels for 50 bags, and the market was stable.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Orchid Seeds Arrive but Inventory is Lacking</h3>
<p>Recently, the arrival of orchid seeds has been scarce, and the inventory is lacking. The Taiyuan ship arrived in Shanghai from Xiamen the day before yesterday, with only 70 pieces. The prices opened yesterday. Dry and lustrous ones are priced at about 25 taels, and those of lower quality are 1-3 taels lower. Everything depends on the yellowness of the color. The worst ones have not been opened yet. If more arrives in the future, there may be hope for relaxation.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Foreign Silk Sales Completely Stalled</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market in this city became more and more silent. The reason is that European and American silk telegrams have not turned around. The silk factories in Shanghai are preparing to stop business because of their opposition to public measurement. All futures silk are now stopping sales. The European and American factories have plenty of goods in hand, and no one asks about them. Yesterday, the market for spot and futures silk was completely stalled.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Increasingly Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were no large transactions of Zhenmei Zhucha and other goods. The prices of various tea markets were two or three taels lower than before. The large gang market is still stalled. Although the Gongxi green tea and Qining black tea and Russian stores Association has talked about prices, the market has not officially opened yet. Now that the Mid-Autumn Festival has arrived, the inventory in the market is still five-six. The price of tea has fallen again and again, and the poor market is unprecedented in recent years.</p>
<h3>Cloth Customer Sales Gradually Become Quiet</h3>
<p>The cloth market was not very changed yesterday. The eastern and northern goods have gradually become quiet, because the price of each product has risen too sharply. However, the Sichuan gang is active. Yesterday, the telegram came to add a lot of items. Banana leaf Zhongshan Ni is 2.8%, rich four seas is 2.775%, and heavenly large handle fleece is 2.075%. Ronghua Fugui printed seersucker is 2.075%, all have a large number of people to do it. Because the time of the festival is approaching, the need for the stomach is also dull. Occasionally, there are people who sell it back. Therefore, yesterday, the first tribute straight tribute satin Zijinshan fine Biji, etc., turned a little soft. However, although the Osaka pricing slightly fell yesterday, the gold price rebounded. Calculated in Shanghai, the difference is still huge. Therefore, the quotation of water waves fleece continued to rise, foreign beauty is 2.375%, double dog is 2.25%, Yang Guifei is 2.2%, and wool bar fleece also rose sharply. Civilization Opera has to be 2.5%, beauty ship is 2.475%, fine Biji straight tribute Ni has not changed. The release of carp straight tribute Ni from the west goods rose again yesterday, and the trader has opened 2.6%, and the Sichuan gang made 150 pieces. The hand goods is 2.5%.</p>

<h3>Impressions of a Northern Tour</h3>
<p>— Su Ling</p>
<p>(9) Night in Harbin</p>
<p>"Night in Harbin" is a pantomime by Chen Ningqiu, depicting the misery of a nation of exiles in a foreign land. Before I even arrived in Harbin, the Huaguang Troupe performed it at the Huaguang Theater.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen told me that the performance of this pantomime was quite successful, especially in the stage design. The changes in lighting added a lot of mood to the play, thanks to the stage of the Huaguang Theater.</p>
<p>The plot involves three exiled beggars, one carrying a guitar, one with a mandolin, and one playing a small drum, standing on the bustling streets of this foreign land. Snow is falling, and in the cold wind, they tremble, using their frozen hands to play old, broken instruments. The mournful melodies scatter in the frigid air, amidst the bustling city, the snowflakes, and the cold glow of the streetlights... Yet, the people of this foreign land, the fashionable noblewomen, the pot-bellied shop owners... shuttle past these three exiles. They all seem not to see these three ethnic outcasts, not to hear the trembling melodies, and the sound of the small drum, as if a heart is quivering. They shuttle along their way, the women smiling and laughing, the men waving their canes.</p>
<p>The lights of the coffee shop gradually brighten, changing into various colors from bright to gradually dimming. Now, the streetwalkers are becoming increasingly scarce and gradually disappearing. The snow falls heavier and dances in the cold wind. The three beggars, pitiful, their melodies silenced, hungry, frozen, these homeless people finally collapse and sleep in the snow, trembling. It is late at night, and the cold wind is so desolate. At this time, the stern police come, waving small batons, using their feet to drive them away…</p>
<p>The lights of the coffee shop have gone out. Except for the snow dancing in the cold wind, everything is still.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen's play is based on Central Avenue in Harbin. So, hearing "Night in Harbin," after he finished telling the play's content, he adjusted the strings of his guitar and played the tune that the three beggars played, the plaintive melody trembling in the cold night.</p>
<p>I came out from Mr. Chen's place, passing Central Avenue to return to my residence.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a familiar sound lured me. Oh, in the dark corner of that street end, isn't it? There stand the three characters from Mr. Chen's play. Ah, three exiled foreign beggars, silently, trembling, plucking frozen strings, the mournful tremolo echoing in the rustling of people's clothing as they pass by.</p>
<p>Returning, I picked up a useless canvas and, under the light, painted these three beggars. Moreover, I added a small black dog, with the night shadow of this northern city as the background.</p>
<p>I titled this painting "Nocturne."</p>
<h3>Jinda Female Students Preparing for Autonomous Association</h3>
<p>— Kun</p>
<p>The National Jinan University, both the university and middle school divisions, has over two hundred female students. There has never been an autonomous organization. Recently, Zhang Wenzhu and Wu Feng initiated a call for all female students to discuss and decide to organize an autonomous association. With the permission of the school's moral education committee and registration, a preparatory committee was formally established, and seven people, including Zhang and Wu, were elected as preparatory committee members. It is scheduled to complete preparations before the Double Tenth Festival, and then formally elect executive committee members and supervisory committee members. The group is named the National Jinan University Female Student Autonomous Committee. Its purpose is (1) to seek happiness for all female students, (2) to develop the autonomous abilities of female students, cultivate a spirit of service, and prepare for serving society in the future.

<h3>Car Style Name Compendium: Countries Have Established Uniform Names</h3>
<p>— Ji Ren</p>
<p>Car body style names vary from country to country. Major car body manufacturers in England, France, and the United States have recently recognized the large number of products from various factories and the complexity of their names. Not only do the manufacturers lack standards, but it also makes it difficult for car owners to distinguish between them. Therefore, they initiated the compilation of a car style name compendium to establish standard names for each car.</p>
<p>Take the name "Coupe" as an example. Different countries have different interpretations. In the United States, "Coupe" is the name of a single-seat sedan. In France, "Coupe" refers to a type of convertible. In other countries, it may refer to another type of vehicle. From this, it can be seen that the differences in car names are so great that it is necessary to standardize them.</p>
<p>Comparing the car style name records compiled by car factories in England, France, and the United States, the French version is the most detailed and organized. Its compilation method is based on the position and number of doors and windows of 22 types of cars. The top and rear of this type of vehicle are equipped with movable parts, which can change into 54 types of car styles. One can recognize them at a glance. The disadvantage of the French name is that its naming is slightly specialized. While it is convenient for the factory, it is not easy for car owners and salespeople to remember.</p>
<p>Vehicles are divided into four categories: sedans, convertibles, open cars, and limousines. Lengthening the rear end of each style turns it into a sports car. Installing a movable roof on a limousine turns it into a semi-sedan.</p>
<p>The car name record compiled by the American Society of Automotive Engineers is simpler, but not very detailed. It includes 16 types of car styles, mostly sedans. There are ten basic styles, such as sports cars, small sedans, roadsters, open cars, sedans, and city cars. The others are variations of the standard style. As for limousines with chauffeur compartments, there are only two types. This type of car is most popular in Europe.</p>
<p>England is known for its open cars. There are also 20 types of car style names, which have been reviewed and approved by the British Engineering Standards Association. Among these 20 types, only four are sedans, and the rest are open cars. This shows the British people's love for air and scenery.</p>
<p>The British people's fondness for traveling by car or living in the countryside is also well-known. Throughout the year, cars loaded with daily necessities travel back and forth on the roads, which can be said to be a national custom of England.</p>
<p>The source of English and American car names originates from French. Although the pronunciation is the same, the meanings are different. As for car body construction, the United States has always been known for it. The total annual production volume is higher than that of car factories in other countries. However, in the past four or five years, Europeans have paid attention to this and advocated self-reliance, raising funds to expand the car body construction business in order to resist foreign goods. Therefore, the American car body construction business has been somewhat affected. However, with the large demand from General Motors and other factories in the United States, its business can still occupy the top position in various countries.</p>
<p>In recent years, car styles have been renewed daily, and progress has been accelerating. European car factories also emphasize the appearance of car styles and strive for their products to be affordable and beautiful. Therefore, they all have relatively complete mechanical equipment and use mechanical work for manufacturing. As a result, production has gradually become large-scale. However, they are not yet able to compete with American car factories.</p>
<h3>Thirty-Five Years of American Automobile Development History</h3>
<p>— Pei Gan</p>
<p>Mr. Krullers, General Manager of General Motors in China, said that in the past 35 years, the changes and improvements in automobile manufacturing have never stopped. The goal is to make cars increasingly perfect, with a combination of mechanical excellence, convenient driving, and aesthetic appearance. Now, let's compare an old car from the past with a 1930s car. The difference between ancestor and descendant is laughable. However, this old-style car has its own characteristics. Just because new cars have emerged in recent decades does not mean that the old-style cars of the past are completely worthless.</p>
<p>Mr. Krullers also said that since 1895, the United States has produced no fewer than 640 types of cars. However, in recent times, only 41 famous brands remain. In addition, only older people can vaguely remember one or two. New car drivers do not even know the names of these cars. However, these cars have made contributions to the history of automobile development. They have made it possible for standard-style cars to be sold to the general public at affordable prices. These hundreds of models have each sought their own way forward to solve the practical transportation business.</p>
<p>The United States is the largest automobile producer. The number of new cars produced each year varies from 51 to 1. However, no new models were introduced in 1897. But it is undeniable that the early products did not last long. Of the 136 types of cars produced before 1905, 11 still exist. Between 1905 and 1910, more than 129 types of cars were produced. Five of them are still in use today. In the following decade, 167 new styles were produced. Eleven of them can still be seen today and are regarded as predecessors in the automobile industry. In the decade after that, production decreased, with only 77 new cars being produced. Seven or eight of them are still seen on the market.</p>
<p>The periods with the most automobile style production were 1901, 1902, 1903, 1907, 1908, and 1916. The following table can</p>

<p>— Ke Luo</p>
<p>The American speedboat speed competition was held in the Hudson River this year. Among them, there was a small 19-foot speedboat equipped with a Paget six-cylinder engine, which can travel at 132 miles per hour. The route from Albany to New York averaged 30.5 miles per hour. According to the driver, Mr. Jack, the Paget engine has great resistance, and the oiling and shifting functions are very good. Therefore, its victory this time is due to this engine.</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>provides an overview of the number of automobile styles produced in each year. What is particularly interesting is that there were 47 new styles in 1901, 33 in 1902, and 51 in 1903.</p>

<p>1896 1</p>
<p>1897 0</p>
<p>1898 6</p>
<p>1899 9</p>

<p>1901 47</p>
<p>1902 33</p>
<p>1903 51</p>

<p>1926 1</p>
<p>1927 4</p>
<p>1928 3</p>
<p>1929 5</p>
<p>Among the above list, a table can also be created for the famous vehicles. However, the names are mostly unknown to current car drivers. For example, brand names such as Adria, Ankai, Carthage, and Fogg have long been forgotten. However, these cars were also very popular before Chevrolet, Cadillac, and Buick were introduced. In short, the cars of the past were propelled by chains, the power of the motor was very weak, and the doors were installed at the end of the car. Today, the movement is silent, smooth, and stable, and the form is extremely beautiful. Comparing the past with the present, it is certainly impossible to compare them in terms of value. However, these 840 different styles of cars and decades of history have made great contributions to the progress of the automobile industry.</p>
