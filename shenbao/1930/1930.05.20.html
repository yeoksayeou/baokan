<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c5">再論歐洲合衆國 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>歐洲合衆國之組織。使果能實現白里安之理想。則誠足促成歐洲之更生。以進於繁榮。惟有何種理由。足以擔保此政治與經濟統一中心勢力之成立。并得有秩序的國際管理。則須大費考慮。吾人就國際間地位言之。歐洲雖感覺美國經濟勢力之威脅。然關於投資商業等互相利益。亦甚密切。聨盟之舉。不致增加歐美之隔閡否。俄國與歐洲。亦有重要關係。且其地隸屬於歐洲者亦甚廣大。今若摒之於聨邦之外。不致增加國際間之困難否。法當局雖聲明與俄美之利益。並無衝突。又聲明此舉並非用以對付歐洲以外任何國家。然能否消除俄美等國之疑慮。則尙未敢知也。英在歐洲之地位。與蘇俄相同。而與大陸諸國。情勢略異英人常言海洋爲聨合之根據。重要不下於大陸。又云。濱臨大西洋之國家。不論位在何洲。其團結力較歐陸各國爲堅。頗露不重視歐陸結合之意。故即使英亦列入聨邦之内。而英之是否贊同。亦尙未可知也。再以歐洲之政治經濟言之。各國政治上之組織。及一切事業發展之程度。不甚相同今合作之範圍。包括甚廣。如工程運輸勞工衛生文化等事。無一不列入合作之内。如此廣大範圍。如何而能使管理適宜。不致抺煞歷史陳跡。强人以所難。殊不易有相當之把握。更再以經濟論。歐洲自大戰後。商業自由交通。旣感困難。近則因各欲解决其生活。競興工業奪取貿易市塲。今果欲謀實際上之合作。必須先代爲掃除商業交通自由之障礙。更須按照利益均等情形。分配歐洲市塲。使不以國界爲限。成一大規模之無競爭企業。其難又更甚乎。且今日歐洲之商業。目光皆注意於稅率一事。前此之關稅會議。自由與保護两派。即大起糾紛。中歐諸國之經濟情形。與他國不同。工業尤較他國急進。故其主張自由貿易甚烈。而他國則又反對。今日外電稱德人論聨邦事。謂宜以經濟爲先。對白氏主張。表示不滿其他奥捷等。當亦同此感想。即此一點言之。合作巳甚感困難。由是可知合衆國之欲由理想而成爲事實。殆非旦夕間事矣。國内要電二</p>

<p>值得紀念的凳子禮台中央是總理遺像。下面便是陳烈士的相片。前面擺着一隻長方形的凳子。聽說陳烈士在那年和同志打南市兵工廠時候。被袁世凱手下的人綁縛在這凳子上。用鞭打着。但是烈士覺得肉體受的痛苦是不打緊的。並不能减少革命的熱望。所以到如今。大家對了這隻值得紀念的凳子。都起一百分的敬意。</p>

<p>中西之戀愛某演員從生活二字。講到中西之戀愛。渠謂西洋人之生活頗有程序。他們由兒童之活潑時期。進而爲中年之戀愛時期。由中年之戀愛時期。進而爲壯年之求名利時期。最後纔爲老年之安閒享樂時期。中國人即都是弄得亂七八糟。推其原因。就是中國缺少一個戀愛時期。因爲中國祇有結婚後一度之「房間戀愛。」除了房間之外。簡直是沒有戀愛可談。現在雖然說是進步了。但又是一種所謂「工具的戀愛」而巳。所謂工具戀愛也者。就是說某女士性喜文學。我就運用文學來學伊談戀愛。某女士喜歡觀電影。我就請伊看電影。總是想用一種工具來得到伊的歡心這位演員講話都帶滑稽。聽衆皆爲之捧腹大笑。</p>

<p>人身有如僬僥乃屬一病。非天下眞有此矮人國也。西人嘗薈萃各國短人。筆之於書。以便參考。有英人名哈得孫者。生於明崇禎二年。死於康熙三十二年。年黨而立。祗長一尺三寸。乾隆六年。法國有短人。名曰小兒。生時重僅一斤餘。六歲時祗重十斤。十五歲時。長二尺餘。至二十三歲而死。荷蘭有短人。生於光緒四年。兄弟九人。與人無異。獨殿後之一女。襁褓時。祗長七寸餘。五歲時。長一尺二寸。重二斤餘。七歲時長一尺五寸。重七斤。置其人於案上。其父在旁。两两相較。渾如泰山之於邱垤。（本書有圖）然此女靈慧異常兒。除通本國語言外。兼通英法德語。游歷各國。觀者輒者投以錢。馴致鉅富唯體氣柔弱。幾不勝衣。脊骨猶人。而两足無力。有巴黎某醫士考其脈數。容清無殊燕瘦。睡時止八九鐘。日間常露懽。娛無憂戚之態。有贈以物者。必受而恭謝。又法國博學報。載有俄人一名。年巳十九。止重五法斤。長一尺六寸云。</p>
<p>此外所載大半根據科學。不同子虚顧於短人。未推究其所由。而出自生成。非關磨折矯揉。則有足信者。吾國古有僬僥氏。長三尺然韋昭曰「西南夷别名。」其說亦非確。不知賦形之初。天果何以生之。</p>

<p>LesSoixanteansdeHenriMatisse</p>
<p>正是瑪諦斯六十誕辰的翌日。在巴黎歐司班爾大路九十九號的那畫廓舉行瑪諦斯傑作展覽會。陳列着這位「生活的享樂」的大師的傑作。這其中把這天才的最近的作品與早年的作品混雜地掛着。有素描有油畫。大槪有六十多幅。眞是很可尊貴而難得的機會。我接連去看了好幾回以後。我在這位天才的畫面上悟到一種新的情味。更覺得這一次方纔接近眞的瑪蒂斯的畫的感覺。因爲平日在美術館在畫廓偶然看到幾張他的作品是决不能看出他的情味來。要研究一個作家終要從他的各方面各時期去看。不但對於瑪諦斯是這樣說。就是對於一切大師都是這樣。其先我在日本時。看過種種關於瑪諦斯的畫集或著色的複製品。自然先巳略略曉得一點瑪諦斯的輪廓。雖然百十二分的崇仰他。却還感不到如何深奥的眞的情味來。於今正是這位歐羅巴第一天才六十生辰的時候。我竟直接細味到他的大部的傑作了。這眞是我生平第一件快事。同時我親自感到的。有如下文。　　藝術作品的表白。是人類的發揚。『生的奮進』的表現。從内部精神的必然所發生的生物學的現象。我更覺得現代創造者的特點是用作品的傅達以肯定各人的個性。所以心理學奮取了「槪念主義」的地位。着重於由個人心中所覺醒的情緒。這樣的畫無論其所用的方法如何。總比爲宗敎。故事的畫題或摹仿自然外表而作的畫要高超萬倍。它超越即時性的與偶然性的。而以永久的絶對性。即人類的情緒爲基礎。我不承認所謂畫幅有其特别的世界。有其特别的法則。與目的那種可笑而狹隘的原則。藝術只是大千世界生活的一刹那。我現在更信任我從前的主張反對『法則』。以直覺去透入藝術品。以情感去吟味的話。我所說的『絶對的永恒』並不是當作我們所表現的世界的方式種類。數目。而是情緒的奔放。關於這些說話。我不怕任何人的譏評甚至辱駡說我是反抗某種唯識主義。某種形式主義。我終是感覺到要這樣的說。</p>

<p>吐痰與衛生之淺說</p>
<p>市衛生局、舉辦第五屆衛生運動消息、巳誌前報、聞該局於前昨两日、派遣管理員衛生巡長等、在各處張貼標語、分發各種印刷品、並督率清道夫、打掃工作、十分繁忙、又該局此次對於宣傅預防霍亂工作、尤極注意、各處張貼之標語中、亦以此項標語爲多、又該局近奉衛生部發下吐痰與衛生淺說一種、詳言隨意吐痰之害、該局巳於前昨两日、分給市民注意、我國社會間犯隨意吐痰之惡習者甚衆、茲將吐痰與衛生淺說原文錄後以冀犯此惡習者之攺革、</p>
<p>吐痰與衛生癆病是由癆病菌生的、菌就是微生物、是一種用肉眼看不見的極小生活物、假如把牠們用一種名呌顯微鏡的特别放大、那就可以看見了、如果沒有癆病菌、决不會起癆病的、癆病菌散布的範圍、非常廣汎、所以很多人常常在不知不覺之間、因爲接觸了這危險物、就受癆病的感染、但是癆病菌、雖然廣汎存在、可是牠的濃度和牠的毒力、各處是很相差的、像飛散在空氣中的、通常是極稀薄、並且毒力很微弱、反過來說癆病人的痰、他的痰沫是最濃厚、並且有强毒的危險物、假如用數目、字把牠們的强度表現出來、空氣是和一相當痰、就是和一億到百億相當、可見痰傅播病毒的厲害、癆病菌增殖的地方、是在病人的病部、雖然在體内包藏無數的癆病菌、當肺病之初期、牠沒有夾在痰裏、排出體外的時候、痰沫在傅染上、縱無何等危險的意味、過了一定的時期、肺痰病病菌、會混在吐的痰咯的血内排出到體外、或是病人把痰咽下、混在糞便内、多量排出、或者病人自巳竟患腸癆、從糞便排出、又像是腎癆、膀胱癆、病人的某時期、也可從尿中排出無量的癆病菌、這就全有傅染的危險了、此外鼻汁·眼的分泌物·膿汁、乳汁·血液等、也是癆病感染的原因、凡這些癆病菌排出的淵源、都不可大意忽略、就中癆病預防上、頂要緊的便是痰現在把痰按危險程度來說、又分四種、第一是病人吐出的痰、包括痰孟和粘痰的布或紙在内、第二是病人的咳嗽噴嚔噴出的痰沫、包括對談說笑的痰沬在内、第三是病人的吐痰或咳嗽的痰沬所附着的一般物品飲食物並手指、第四是痰或痰沬乾燥後隨灰塵散布的空氣、就這四種論、牠的危險性大小、是和牠們的順序、是一樣的、吐痰是很要注意的、癆病菌是沒色的微生物、假設反牠們作爲紅色時、那麽痰便是很濃的紅色了、至於病人的寢具周圍的物品、也可認作點點的紅色、看護人的手指、也可染爲紅色痰的顔色濃、就是表示重要的意思痰的粘着力很强、痰沬很容易附着到物體上、隨時隨處、都可停留雖然是以後乾燥剥離、難能减少危險性、但是反而能長久保存牠、對於乾燥的抵抗力、非常的强、經過數月時、而數年仍不失去牠的生活性和感染力、這乾燥痰、漸漸便磨碎、隨着風塵、或者和衣服紙布等的細絲、一同飛散在空氣中、便得侵入人的呼吸器中了、又蒼蠅很好舐痰、或者把痰粘着在蒼蠅脚上、更由牠飛搬到人的口邊或食物上、又或飛到鄰家、達到遠方、隨時隨處、都易傅播癆病菌、所以感染上最危險的、就是痰不過在癆病感染的强度、新痰或乾燥痰、有很大的差異罷了、從病人的咳嗽噴嚔、將痰的痰沬、直接吸入的、這是新痰、危險性大、感染力濃厚、若是吸入有極稀薄乾燥癆病菌的空氣、這是乾燥痰、危險性小、感染力微弱、在這两種的中間、還有種種的階級、可見隨時隨地亂吐痰、是很不好的事情、不問危險大小、都能傅染人、癆病菌侵入到體内、不直接發病、如到了肺便成了肺癆、也是不直接發病的、多費數月、到數十年、漸漸蔓延、但是癆病菌、也不限於常是這樣緩慢進行、假如又得着適當的侵入機會和增殖的方便、也有急速進行的所以癆病的發病時期、在感染後、早則數十日、遲則數十年、而發病的症候、有很明瞭的、也有全然不明的、一個肺癆的病人、可以在二十四小時内咳出的癆病菌、多到數千萬個、當病人大咳的時候、每每由細微的痰沬、從口内噴出·凡在三四尺以内的人、都可受牠危害、這痰沬如不直接去侵犯人、就掉在地上、不久即乾借着塵埃、飛散在痰的含粘液的、牠乾了時、黏的牢固、就是要洗刷也不容易、便成了傳染的預備物件凡是痰吐在地上或電車火車中以及公共的地方、都大有害於人、有時我們的鞋底或裙邊上、如果粘了沒乾的痰、和生活的菌就能够把菌引到我們家内、漸漸成了塵埃、假如是在太陽光不足的地方、那菌的生命、更活賽長也、就是我們的生命更要招傅染的禍、因爲菌在幽暗的地方、雖不能自動、可是掃帚鷄毛帚每能帮助牠飛揚、散在家用的物件上、凡用這物件的、就有吸入病菌的危險、傅染癆病的機會、所以千萬别隨時隨地吐痰、以免這病菌的廣播、吐痰總要吐在痰桶或痰孟等内、如防蠅子的飛着痰孟、可以加藎、痰桶的可以加水、如果能在痰桶的如上消毒防疫用的臭藥水、那更好了、假設的自備相當大的乾凈紙·或新棉紗或布等等、當一時找不着痰桶痰孟的時候、就吐在牠們上頭、隨即把牠燒了、那更好、又當着不論官自己還是他人咳嗽噴嚔的時候、要用這紙或棉紗或布或小手巾等、將口鼻遮一遮、不得巳用手、也可以防飛散痰沬的來優犯、萬一有時和癆病人談話時也要同樣留意、這紙棉紗布等、也要同樣消毒、在房屋内土地上地板上、無論何處何地、都不要隨意吐痰、人人都要這樣、時時都要這樣、要互相小心戒勉、以杜絶减少癆病的發生、此外還不要把癆咽下、以免損害食慾、發生腸癆、並且使癆菌存在糞便内、排出散布、所用的痰桶痰孟等、也要隨時消毒、牠的消毒法、頂好用是蒸煮、如不易做到、簡單方法、是用開水來再三冲洗、多晒日光、</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e5">Re-discussing the United States of Europe <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>The organization of the United States of Europe, if it can realize Briand's ideal, would truly promote the regeneration of Europe and lead to prosperity. However, what reasons are there to guarantee the establishment of this political and economic unified center of power and to have orderly international management? This requires careful consideration. From the perspective of international relations, although Europe feels the threat of the economic power of the United States, the mutual benefits regarding investment and commerce are also very close. Will the alliance increase the estrangement between Europe and the United States? Russia also has important relations with Europe, and its territory belonging to Europe is also very extensive. If it is excluded from the union, will it not increase international difficulties? Although the French authorities have stated that there is no conflict with the interests of Russia and the United States, and have also stated that this action is not intended to deal with any country outside Europe, it is not yet known whether it can eliminate the concerns of Russia, the United States, and other countries. Britain's position in Europe is similar to that of Soviet Russia, and its situation is slightly different from that of the continental countries. The British often say that the ocean is the basis of the alliance, which is no less important than the continent. They also say that the solidarity of countries bordering the Atlantic Ocean, regardless of their location on any continent, is stronger than that of the European continental countries, revealing a lack of emphasis on European continental integration. Therefore, even if Britain is included in the union, it is still unknown whether Britain will agree. Furthermore, in terms of European politics and economy, the political organizations of various countries and the degree of development of all undertakings are not very similar. Now the scope of cooperation includes a wide range of areas, such as engineering, transportation, labor, health, and culture, all of which are included in the cooperation. How can such a wide scope make management appropriate without erasing historical traces and forcing people to do what is difficult? It is especially difficult to have a considerable grasp of this. Furthermore, in terms of economics, since the Great War, Europe has found commercial freedom and transportation difficult. Recently, in order to solve their livelihoods, they have competed to develop industry and seize trade markets. If they want to seek practical cooperation, they must first remove the obstacles to commercial and transportation freedom, and then distribute the European market according to the principle of equal benefits, so that it is not limited by national boundaries and becomes a large-scale non-competitive enterprise. Is the difficulty even greater? Furthermore, today, European commerce is focused on tariffs. In previous tariff conferences, the free trade and protectionist factions had major disputes. The economic situation of the Central European countries is different from that of other countries, and their industry is particularly more advanced than other countries, so they strongly advocate free trade, while other countries oppose it. Today, foreign telegrams claim that the Germans are discussing the union, saying that economics should come first, expressing dissatisfaction with Briand's proposal. Other countries, such as Austria and Czechoslovakia, probably have the same feelings. From this point alone, cooperation is already very difficult. From this, it can be seen that the desire for the United States to transform from an ideal into a reality is probably not something that can be achieved overnight.

<p>European Federation Plan</p>
<p>Believes France Intends to Dominate</p>
<p>On the 18th, the National Society telegraphed from Berlin that after the publication of Briand's memorandum on the United States of Europe, German political and public opinion was divided. Major newspapers stated that Germany occupies an important position in Briand's plan and that without Germany's participation, it would be difficult to realize. However, most newspapers believe that this is a clever plan by France to dominate Europe and that some points must be fundamentally changed before Germany can accept it. What is most opposed in the eyes of Germans is that members of the Pan-European Congress must be limited to member states of the European continent of the International League. In this way, not only Russia cannot join, but even the United Kingdom will be excluded. It goes without saying that the autonomous territories cannot be included. Furthermore, Briand's assertion that economic issues must be secondary to political issues is also strongly opposed by the German newspapers, because the Germans believe that economic integration must precede political integration. As for the conservative newspaper "Deutsche Tageszeitung," it completely rejected Briand's proposal and declared that if the principle of complete sovereignty is enjoyed by each state in the United States of Europe, Germany will be completely equal to other countries, and all economic and military restrictions imposed on it will naturally be lifted.</p>
<p>Reuters telegraphed from London on the 18th that the 27 countries in Europe have received the original text of French Foreign Minister Briand's statement on the organization of the United States of Europe, which is quite long. The British government will study it in detail before signing and replying. The entire report will be submitted to a European Congress to be held in Geneva during the next League of Nations Assembly.</p>

<p>Indian Salt Law Completely Broken</p>
<p>Although There Are Many Military and Police, They Cannot Be Stopped</p>
<p>Reuters telegraphed from Bombay on the 18th that 400 non-violent resistance volunteers, aided by thousands of onlookers wearing homespun cloth, attacked the Wadala salt field today. Although there were 300 military and police officers, they could not drive them away. The field occupies more than six square miles, with more than 20,000 stoves. The area is easily accessible from all directions, making it difficult to prevent entry and exit. The crowd came to attack, well prepared. They dispersed after four hours. 400 people were arrested, but a large amount of salt was taken away. Many people sprinkled salt on the heads of the police, which was quite comical. There was no riot throughout.</p>
<p>Reuters telegraphed from Bombay on the 19th that 70 more people were detained yesterday for looting the salt field. 121 of those arrested yesterday have been released. The remaining 279 people, and the 70 people arrested afterward, will be charged with illegal assembly and destruction of the salt law.</p>
<p>Reuters telegraphed from Bombay on the 19th that the 280 people detained yesterday for attacking the Wadala salt field are all on a hunger strike at the Wili detention center. Another 225 people are also on a hunger strike in Dharasana.</p>
<p>Reuters telegraphed from Sholapur on the 19th that the military court has retried the 26 defendants in the recent riot case. The heaviest sentence was imprisonment for seven years and a fine of 10,000 rupees. Six boys, 15 years old, were flogged and released.</p>
<p>Reuters telegraphed from Sholapur on the 19th that the overall situation has gradually improved in the past few days. Commercial markets have become active, and textile factories have resumed work one after another. Banks and post offices have also opened. The military court has been dissolved, and the civil court has reopened.</p>
<p>US Tariff Bill and Prohibition Law</p>
<h3 id="e51">Hitting Hoover's Future <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>US News on the 18th telegraphed from Washington that the repeatedly delayed new tariff bill will be voted on in the Senate tomorrow. After this vote, the tariff bill will either be sent directly to President Hoover for approval or be delayed again until December. If this delay occurs, the sensational new tariff bill may be shelved and disappear without a trace. Recalling the origins of this case, it was based on Hoover's declaration to aid farmers when he took office. Once Hoover took office, he convened a special session of Congress to resolve the case. However, it has been delayed again and again until today. The purpose of this case has also changed greatly. According to representatives from the Midwestern states, even if this case is passed, farmers will not only be unable to receive a dime's worth of relief, but will suffer greatly. Many semi-official organizations have also sent letters to the government expressing protests, stating that this case is biased towards certain manufactured products, and the result will actually increase the suffering of workers across the country, harm foreign trade, and stagnate the circulation of domestic goods. It is said that President Taft's departure was due to his inability to handle the Ailertley district case properly. If the new tariff bill is passed and implemented, President Hoover may follow in his footsteps. Various newspapers have spent a lot of effort in interpreting the export tax portion of the new tariff bill. As for the dispute over the prohibition law, after Morrow issued a declaration while conducting his senatorial election campaign, both sides who supported and opposed prohibition were earnestly discussing it. Those who supported Morrow even promoted Morrow as the only person to succeed President Hoover. Those who opposed prohibition tried hard to refute Morrow's remarks. In summary, the tariff bill and the prohibition law may have a huge impact on the upcoming congressional elections.</p>

<p>Japanese News telegraphed from Tokyo on the 19th that the Finance Minister Plenipotentiary arrived in Tokyo at 8:30 this morning and went to the Prime Minister's residence immediately to hold an extraordinary cabinet meeting. At the meeting, the Finance Minister stated that the disarmament conference had encountered many difficulties, and it took a lot of time to explore the positions of various countries and exchange views with each other. The negotiations and clashes can be said to have been harmoniously conducted. I am weak in my ability and unable to achieve full results, which is very regrettable. However, the general trend is like this, and there is nothing to be done about it. In the future, we will strive to approve the treaty and do our best to deal with the current situation. Later, the Prime Minister, on behalf of the cabinet members, gave a reply. The meeting adjourned at 10 o'clock. The Prime Minister and the Minister of the Navy went to the Ministry of the Navy to hand over the affairs to the Minister of the Navy. The Minister of the Navy immediately visited the Chief of the Naval General Staff Kato. It is heard that Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki will arrive in Yokohama on June 18, and the naval treaty is expected to be approved before the summer vacation.</p>
<p>Japanese News telegraphed from Tokyo on the 19th that after the Finance Minister Plenipotentiary returns to the country, a military council meeting will be held. This action requires the consent of the military minister, and the government has no direct involvement. However, according to the government's observation, the meeting will be held around the 27th.</p>

Although this is not a pioneering effort, thousands of people from Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and other places came to watch its departure. After flying around Lake Constance once, it headed southwest. The latest report said that it has flown over France and is expected to land in Seville, Spain, on Monday afternoon. After loading passengers and mail, it will cross the ocean to Pernambuco. A special mast has been installed in that area. If the weather is good, it may land once more in Cuba. Its final destination is Lakehurst, New York. The purpose of this trip is to test whether a regular passenger and mail service can be opened between South America and Seville. There is currently air service between Seville and Berlin, and Pernambuco will also establish a special aviation network with major ports in South America.</p>

Two Moth aircraft escorted the lady upon arrival. She then attended a dinner party at the British Aviation Association, telling the Reuters reporter that it would be impossible to break the previous record for flying from England to Australia because she encountered headwinds and storms along the way, visibility was poor, and the new propeller installed in Yangon was not as satisfactory as the old one, so she could not open full speed. It is heard that the lady does not want to fly back to England from Australia.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Central Government and National Government Memorial Week <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 19th, the Central Party Headquarters held the 60th weekly memorial service for the Premier in the Great Hall. About 500 to 600 people attended, including members of the Central Committee, heads and staff of various departments, and guests. After Chairman Dai Fuxian led the ceremony, Zeng Yangfu, Deputy Chairman of the Construction Committee, reported on his recent trip to Japan for observation. He stated that he visited major factories in various ports in Japan, investigated their historical statistics and progress, and compared them proportionally. Regarding important industrial sectors such as textiles, steel, electricity, silk, and shipbuilding, from 1915 to 1924, the comparison of capital and production showed an average increase of two to three times in capital and approximately 20% to 30% in production. From 1924 to 1929, there was even more rapid progress, with an increase rate of up to 50%, which is quite astonishing. However, this progress is definitely not solely due to the efforts made in these five years but is the result of the entire nation working together with one heart and one mind, conducting thorough research, and preparing for many years. This is something we should pay attention to. As for how our country should resist economic aggression, I believe that the advanced members of the Party have already foreseen this and determined the direction. While in Tokyo, Miyazaki Ryusuke, the leader of the Japanese Minsei Party, visited him several times and expressed his consistent belief in the Three Principles of the People, wanting to extract its essence as the political program for the Minsei Party. He also mentioned the complexity of Japanese political parties, fearing that if the Minsei Party could not succeed, the Communist Party would succeed. Zeng Yangfu said that there was nothing to worry about because the power of the Three Principles of the People, which is believed by people, will surely spread throughout the world and achieve final success. There are currently two forces in the world: (1) imperialism and (2) anti-imperialism. Imperialists act hegemonically, benefiting themselves at the expense of others, while anti-imperialists act righteously, seeking both their own benefit and that of others. Righteousness will ultimately prevail over hegemony. Mr. Miyazaki listened to this and seemed to agree. Next, Dai Fuxian delivered a report on the Chinese cultural spirit received by Japan, after which the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the same morning, the National Government held its weekly memorial service for the Premier. Over 300 people attended, including Tan Yankai, Gu Yingfen, Chen Shaokuan, Jiang Menglin, Zhang Nanxian, Zhang Wenhua, Chen Yu, Shi Jingnong, and officials from the two departments of the National Government's Civil Affairs Office and Military Affairs Office. After Chairman Tan Yankai led the ceremony, Yang Xiji, Director of the Bureau of Documents, gave the following political report: (1) Military Affairs: On the Longhai Railway front, our central army reached Yejigang in Minquan County in the middle, Suixian on the left flank, and Kaocheng on the right flank, currently advancing towards Lanfeng. The rebel enemies Sun Dianying, Wan Xuancai, Yue Xiangru, and others were completely routed. In Guangxi, our army has captured Guixian, and the remnants of the enemy in Nanning and Guilin can be suppressed in no time. (2) Politics: Regarding immigration and land reclamation, the State Council has previously decided to transfer the matter to the Executive Yuan, instructing the provincial governments to prepare plans. Recently, Chairman Jiang proposed the establishment of a National Unemployment Research Committee to provide relief. The Central Political Council has now transferred Minister Kong Xiangxi's three proposed measures for immigration and land reclamation, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for consideration. National unemployment is a major national crisis. If the people's livelihood problem cannot be solved, then the two principles of nationalism and democracy cannot be realized. The government is now seeking to alleviate national unemployment, which is only a temporary solution. The fundamental solution lies in the construction of political tutelage after the end of military affairs, following the Premier's instructions to start with the industrial plan, so that the success of people's happiness and benefit can be achieved. (3) Diplomacy: The Sino-Japanese tariff agreement has been approved. After this lesson, our country's diplomatic authorities should, when concluding treaties in the future, comply with the provisions of Article 25, Section 2 of the Organic Law of the National Government, and when convening meetings of creditors' representatives, pay close attention to Articles 4 and 6 of our Party's foreign policy, daring not to be negligent again. Furthermore, Japan still refers to us as "Shina" in international documents, while we refer to them as the "Empire of Great Japan." How can they call us "Shina?" Even in private interactions, names should follow the preference of the host, let alone in international relations. During the Manchu government era, Japan referred to it as the "Great Qing Empire." Now they do not call us the Republic of China but call us "Shina." We are perhaps not as good as the Manchu government. If we were to call them "Wozi" and refer to them as the "Great Wozi Empire" in international documents, I know that Japan would definitely not recognize it. It is up to others to insult us or not, but it is up to us to accept the insult or not. If Japan uses such impolite wording again, we must return it and severely reprimand them. It is the duty of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be loyal to its duties, striving not to disgrace the country.</p>

<p>Zhang Zhu Arrives in Xuzhou to Meet Jiang</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The vanguard of the Central Army, the Third Division, captured Guide Railway Station and advanced to Xiaoba. Then it turned south, and the Eleventh Division advanced to the front, taking Liu River directly from Xiaoba. Wan Xuancai's troops retreated from Zhuji to the east bank of Liu River to gather. Furthermore, Shi Zhenqing's troops of Zhao Guanying's division of the Jin Army were stationed on the east bank of Liu River, extending to Ningling to the south of the line. On the 15th, the Eleventh and Third Divisions of the Central Army attacked in two routes and engaged in fierce fighting on the east bank of Liu River. The Jin Army used the "Zhongshan" armored car to protect their advance to resist. The Central Army launched a vigorous attack from both sides and used the "Huguang" armored car to cover their shooting. The Jin Army suffered a major defeat. The Eleventh Division captured a regimental commander, Wei Liang, along with 30-40 officers and over 1,000 soldiers to the east of Liu River. The Third Division captured a brigade commander, Shi Zhenqing, along with four regimental commanders and several thousand soldiers near Ningling. Both routes captured a large amount of supplies and ammunition. The "Huguang" armored car engaged the Jin Army's "Zhongshan" armored car, and the "Zhongshan" was destroyed and abandoned on the east bank of Liu River. Zhao Guanying, the division commander of the Jin Army, led the remnants to retreat to the west bank of Liu River. The Eleventh Division occupied Liu River on the 16th, and the Third Division occupied Ningling. Today (17th), according to news from the campaign headquarters, the vanguard has already pressed towards Libaji. It is verified that Liba is the newly established county seat of Minquan, three stations away from Lanfeng.</p>
<p>On the 16th, representatives from all sectors of Guide City went out of the city to Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi, requesting not to attack the city and that Wan's troops could surrender peacefully. Liu agreed to extend the deadline to 4:00 PM today, requiring unconditional surrender. Otherwise, an attack would be launched. At the same time, troops were dispatched to occupy the surrounding fortresses and high grounds near the city. However, no telegram has been received from the front lines this afternoon. According to military sources, the enemy often uses isolated cities to hold out in order to contain the Central Army's forces. The Central Army has seen through this point and is surrounding the city while advancing to deal with it.</p>
<p>Chairman Jiang once went to Mamuji to inspect. On the morning of the 15th, he took a special train west again. That night, the train arrived at Guide Railway Station, where he met with Liu Zhi, Yang Jie, Jiang Chuou, and others on the train to discuss military plans. On the morning of the 16th, he returned east, arriving in Xuzhou that night. Zhang Jingjiang and Zhu Jiahua also came to Xuzhou on the evening of the 14th to meet with Jiang and returned south on the morning of the 15th. It is said that some consultations were held regarding the current situation (17th).</p>

<p>Jinan Correspondence: Jiang Bocheng, Chief Counselor of the Campaign Headquarters, accompanied by Sun Tongxuan, commander of the 12th Army of the First Army Corps, Chief of Staff Zhang Yue, and Fu Jianheng, commander of the armored car force, went to Yucheng to inspect in the "Mountain Car" armored car. Mr. Jiang returned to Jinan today and told reporters that the area between Jinan and Yucheng was very calm. The Jin Army in Dezhou still only had two regiments of Fu Zuoyi's troops, Huo Yuanbi's brigade, mostly cavalry. The front line was in the south of Pingyuan City. Not only have they not dared to advance south in the past two months, but they are also very panicked, fearing our army's advance north. On the Caozhou front, according to a telegram from Division Commander Ruan (Zhaochang) today, Shi Yousan's troops have indeed retreated. Regarding the Longhai Line, no report was received today. Commander-in-Chief Han (Fuqu) is scheduled to return to Jinan from Caozhou tomorrow (17th). After Han returns to Jinan, Army Commander Liu (Zhennian) will conduct consultations on the defense of Jiaodong before returning to Yantai. When returning to Jinan from Yucheng today, he also inspected the Xincheng Arsenal along the way. Another gentleman returned to Jinan from Dezhou today. According to him, Deng Chongxi, the civil affairs director appointed by Shi Yousan, Song Kebin, the finance director, and Li Mengyun, the county magistrate of De County, are all currently in Dezhou. The stationed troops, Huo Yuanbi's troops, are nominally a division, but in reality, only a brigade. A cavalry regiment is stationed in Pingyuan, building defensive fortifications to the south. There are many idle politicians in De County. The inspection of pedestrians between Dezhou and Yucheng is very strict (16th).</p>
<h3 id="e64">Central Training Department <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>A Letter to Comrades Regarding the Training Conference</p>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>The profound significance of training, the arduous nature of training work, and the significant responsibilities of the training departments and sections at all levels of the Party have been described above. However, upon reviewing the past situation, while many training departments and sections at all levels of the Party have earnestly implemented the central government's intentions and worked hard to carry out political tutelage, there are also those who have been lazy, neglected their duties, and failed to achieve satisfactory results. This is not because our Party's revolutionary theories and policies are not perfect, but rather because those engaged in training work have not worked hard enough. If we do not correct our past mistakes and continue to be complacent in the future, not only will the Party's training work not be able to expand, but also the Party's political tutelage construction will hardly proceed smoothly, and the future of the national revolution will be greatly affected. This must be urgently remedied. However, our country is vast, and the situation in various regions is complex. Without a unified strategy, we will inevitably focus on one thing and lose sight of another. If we do not adapt to the time and place, it will be difficult to apply the same standard to all regions. Therefore, we must first understand the actual situation of training work in various regions, gain insight into all the difficult problems in training, and then carefully review them and formulate a plan so that it will not become an empty dream but can be put into practice. The Third Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee has concrete plans for the Party's work during the period of political tutelage and for the training work of Party members and the people, which serve as the criteria. However, this department feels the shortcomings of the past and fears that it will not be able to universally implement the intentions of the Third Plenary Session in the training departments at all levels. Therefore, this national training conference has been convened. It is planned to hold the conference for five days, from March 15th to 20th, with four plenary sessions and several sessions of the motion review committee and group review meetings. During this time, we also received sincere instructions from members such as Jiang Zhongzheng, Hu Hanmin, and Chen Guofu. Thus, the unprecedented national training conference was able to complete its important mission. All decisions made are the fundamental principles of the Party's training work and the major issues that the Party departments in various regions currently consider urgent. Since this conference, the central government has been able to deeply understand the actual situation in various regions and use it as a standard for formulating plans, fulfilling its wishes. The plans that have been promulgated in the past have not been able to fully meet expectations, and no one knows where the knot is. Now, it has been dissolved. Regarding the difficulty of theory and the interpretation of clauses,</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>May 20, 1920 (Shen Bao Second Sheet) Tuesday (8)</p>
<p>Those who can fully grasp its mysteries through correspondence will now receive direct guidance. On the representative side, they have received direct guidance from the central government and have also obtained the coordination of activities in various regions. The spirit has already been united, and the will is easily unified. This is of great help to the Party's training work, which is not insignificant. This is something that our comrades deeply rejoice in.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all my comrades in the Party's training work, whether serving their hometowns, living overseas, or fighting in the midst of gunfire, although the environments in which they are located are different, their responsibilities are the same. At this time when the Party and the country are in dire straits and the people of the whole country are still in deep water, how should we be vigilant, diligent in our duties, adhere to the Premier's teachings and the guidance of the central government, seek truth from facts, devote ourselves to the training of Party members and the people, promote the construction of political tutelage, and complete the mission of building the country with the Party and governing the country with the Party? This should be told to comrades who are responsible for training work in the Party departments at all levels.</p>
<p>All my Party members, having joined the Party because they believe in the Premier's principles, should obey the Party's guidance and devote themselves to the revolution. However, the meaning of revolution is extremely profound, and the work is also very arduous. Therefore, we must first engage in the cultivation of Party loyalty and Party ethics to establish our own personality. We should also seek to enhance our intelligence and skills to cultivate our own strength. Then, we should lead the people by setting an example and work hard to complete the revolutionary cause of saving the country, saving the people, and saving the world under the banner of the Three Principles of the People. This should be told to all my Party members.</p>
<p>All my people already know that the purpose of the Party's revolution is for the overall national interest and have warmly supported it. However, the great cause of revolution cannot be accomplished overnight. There must be considerable sacrifices and a necessary process before the foundation of the revolution can be consolidated and the national interest can be ensured. The comrades of this Party, taking the national interest as the premise, are engaged in the national revolution and are not afraid of hard work and grievances, not avoiding dangers and hardships, sharing joys and sorrows. If the people of the whole country from now on easily view the revolution and pursue quick results, or ignore the revolution and stand by, the hidden worries about the future of the revolution cannot be overstated. Therefore, what this Party sincerely hopes from the people is first to believe in the Three Principles of the People, participate in the national revolution, and strive to practice the use of the four powers and promote local autonomy. If we can do this, not only can the Party's six-year plan for political tutelage be completed as scheduled, but also China's freedom and equality will be hoped for. This should be told to the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as the obstacles to the revolution emerge endlessly, the struggle of the revolution should be intensified accordingly. Since the success of the Northern Expedition, the Party was about to achieve peaceful unification, relieve the people's suffering, and promote the construction of political tutelage to establish the foundation for promoting the principles. However, in the past two years, the rebellions of Gui, Feng, Zhang, and Tang have broken out one after another, and the suppression of chaos and the settlement of changes have not allowed for rest. As for the recent change of Yan and Feng, it is a collection of the remnants of warlords, feudal demons, and all reactionary groups, making a final attempt at the end of their road. Examining the revolutionary history of various countries in the world, the more distinct the confrontation between counter-revolutionary and revolutionary forces, the more thorough the success of the revolution will be. The historical examples are clear and indelible. Those warlord traitors are ignorant of the demands of the people of the whole country and the times,妄冀to use the skill of ants shaking a tree to destroy the foundation of the national revolution. Their foolishness is astonishing, and their妄可哀! At this critical moment, all my comrades and compatriots across the country should have a deep understanding. Today, we do not need to analyze and investigate the strength of the reactionary group. We should only bravely advance, cultivate revolutionary forces, and establish a deep and strong foundation. Today, we do not have time to grieve for the traitors who are heading for a dead end. We should only earnestly admonish them, so that every Party member, in terms of ability and morality, will become the most loyal and courageous guards of the Three Principles of the People. Today, we do not need to blame the past training work for being incomplete. We should only make a painful determination, work hard to invigorate ourselves, and make the compatriots of声国一致薰沐under the Three Principles of the People, possessing the ability to self-defend and self-pacify, and永絶the coveting of reactionary forces. The great cause of the revolution will be completed. The功 of nine仞期于群力,望I hope that my comrades will all be motivated and phấn phát, to comfort the Premier's spirit in heaven and the hopes of compatriots across the country. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Peng Dehuai Flees from Hunan to Jiangxi <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The whereabouts of Peng's bandits after withdrawing from Pingjiang</p>
<p>Occupied Xiushui County on the 16th</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Xiushui in northern Jiangxi borders Tongcheng in Hubei and Pingjiang in Hunan. Located at the intersection of three provinces, bandits can easily be confused. Therefore, the county has suffered from the ravages of Peng (Dehuai) and Huang (Gonglue), the rebel soldiers of Pingjiang, since the year before last, and the poison is unbearable. Although Peng and Huang have drifted into western and southern Jiangxi, the small groups of communist remnants have not been eliminated. It is verified that Peng's bandits are the Fifth Army of the Communist bandits, with thousands of people and more than a thousand guns. Last month, they invaded Yichun, Shanggao, Gaoan, and Lianhua in western Jiangxi. Later, they were encircled and suppressed by Deng Ying's two brigades, Zhu Yaohua's brigade, and Chen Lei's regiment, and the bandits were defeated. The above counties were recovered. Peng's bandits actually fled from Tonggu and Wanzai to Pingliu in Hunan,联合the local communists on the border of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi to capture Pingjiang. He Jian sent five regiments to encircle and suppress them and telegraphed Jiangxi Province to send troops to block them. Peng's bandits saw that the large troops of the Hunan Army had arrived and withdrew from Pingjiang on the 9th, claiming to attack Yuezhou, but secretly moved towards the border of Jiangxi. Because the garrison in this province is sparse, Xiu (Shui), Tong (Gu), and Wan (Zai) are all very tight. Also, because the defense line is too long, it is difficult to block them. According to a telegram from Wuning, Xiushui County was captured by Peng's bandits again on the 16th. The county magistrate and the chief of public security are missing. Countless county residents were brutally killed. The order in the city is extremely chaotic. Farmers in the four townships are fleeing in droves. Wuning, which borders the county, is also very panicked. After County Magistrate Liu Bingkun learned of the above news, he sent a telegram to the provincial government and the Bandit Suppression Headquarters for help, requesting that troops be sent to rescue them as soon as possible. It is heard that the authorities have telegraphed Zhu's brigade and Chen's regiment to quickly encircle and suppress them. (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">Communist Party Organization Cracked in Gulangyu <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Although the Communist Party in Xiamen does not engage in violent acts, distributing leaflets and shouting slogans are common. According to investigations, the authorities have long known that the Fujian Provincial Party Department of the Communist Party is located in Xiamen and that it is located in Gulangyu, but they have been unable to find its location. On the night of the 13th and the 14th, three important Communist Party organizations were cracked in Gulangyu, and it was learned that they were part of the Provincial Party Department.</p>
<p>Previously, a detective from the Gulangyu Public Works Bureau discovered that the residents on the third floor of No. 21, Anzaijiao, were behaving suspiciously. They heard the sound of machinery at night and secretly investigated. At 11:00 PM on the night of the 13th, the Public Works Bureau patrol chief, Bassi, led detectives to surround and search No. 21. Two workers escaped upon hearing the news. Eight lead type trays, a bundle of lead bars, three boxes of black and red ink paste, a printing press, a German printing machine, and a package of important drafts awaiting printing were seized. Later, a worker from the Japanese Boai Hospital at Xizai Wharf was often seen going to No. 21. Upon investigation, his residence was in a small house behind the Boai Hospital garden. The smell of ink used for printing could be smelled from outside. At 10:00 AM on the 14th, Patrol Chief Bassi led detectives, together with the police from the Japanese Consulate, to search the small house in Boai Hospital. They found two large rattan boxes and a large wooden box. The rattan boxes contained many printed leaflets, magazines, books, and other items. The wooden box contained a complete set of new-style lithographic printing machines and lithographic plates newly purchased from the Kanō Store in Tokyo, Japan. The Party took the worker to the bureau for questioning. According to his供, his name is Zeng Shuiyu, from Huian, 25 years old. The rattan and wooden boxes were deposited by Su Wenying. Su lives in Gangzihou. At 11:00, Bassi arrested Su Wenying, Su Nengquan, and Su Baoquan in a Chinese枋皮style small house without a house number in Gangzihou and seized drafts that were being edited and waiting to be printed and a large package of documents from the Fujian Provincial Party Department of the Communist Party. According to them, they are all from Huian. Wenying is 24 years old and a graduate of Jimei Normal School. As a result of this crackdown, it is known that Anzaijiao has a printing department, Boai Hospital is a distribution department, and Gangzihou is an editing department, which is also part of the Communist Party Provincial Party Department. Their plan was to separate the three places, and if one place was cracked, the others would not know. This time, the three places were cracked consecutively, which was probably unexpected by the Communist Party.</p>
<p>After the Public Works Bureau cracked the three places and questioned them, it informed the Xiamen Public Security Bureau of the seriousness of the case by telegram. At 2:00 PM that afternoon, the Public Security Bureau sent detectives to Gulangyu to review the physical evidence together with the Co-Trial Court. At 4:20, they escorted Zeng and Su and the other four people, as well as the seized items, back to Xiamen. They have now been sent to the military law office of the garrison headquarters for interrogation. (16th)</p>
<h3 id="e67">No Results from Meeting on Eastern Railway Electrical Rights <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>First Establish a Special Committee to Study the Proposal</p>
<p>Chinese Proposal Contents and Russian Response</p>
<p>Harbin dispatch on the 12th: The Eastern Railway electrical rights issue, which has been in dispute for months, was discussed at a meeting held on the 2nd of this month at the office of the Eastern Railway Director-General. Because neither side had prepared their proposals, the meeting, though called, did not involve substantive discussion. It was only decided to establish a special committee to exchange and review proposals, and that Chinese, Russian, and English would be the languages used during the meetings, with English as the primary language. Furthermore, the meeting was divided into two stages: the first to discuss telegraphs, and the second to discuss telephones. On May 6th, the Chinese side presented a general outline of the meeting, with ten detailed items for discussion on telegraphs. On May 8th, the Russian side refuted the ten detailed items one by one, particularly objecting to items three, six, and ten. On May 9th, a meeting was held at the Railway Bureau, with all members from both sides attending. The meeting started at 1:15 PM and adjourned around 4 PM. The Chinese and Russian members spoke extensively. The Russian side's opinions can be summarized as follows: the electrical rights meeting must be based on the resolution of the Eastern Railway Board of Directors on April 30th, expanding on its eight-point outline for study. The Chinese telecommunications authorities should not propose separate items for resolution at the meeting. The third item, regarding the Eastern Railway's introduction to the Soviet Union to establish an international telegraph contract, was deemed beyond the authority of the Eastern Railway and Soviet representatives, and the suggestion was rejected. The tenth item, regarding the ability to inspect telecommunications at any time, was completely rejected. The main points of the Chinese members' statements were that the Eastern Railway is a joint Sino-Russian business organization, and this meeting is between the Northeast Transportation Committee and the Eastern Railway; the opinions and resolutions of the Eastern Railway Board of Directors cannot be effective for the Transportation Committee. The third item of the Transportation Committee's detailed telegraph meeting points aims to correct the old contract's (dated November 22, 1922) Eastern Railway and Soviet Union joint-line telegraph methods, simply shifting to a direct relationship between China and the Soviet Union. The old contract should be abolished as soon as possible, and all payment methods for joint lines should be added to the new contract. However, after several hours of debate, no resolution was reached. Finally, both sides agreed to establish a special committee to first discuss the Chinese proposal and the Russian opinions. The proposals decided by the special committee would be reported by both sides to their respective chairmen. If the chairmen had no objections, then formal meetings would begin. The special committee members appointed that day were: Jiang Yi (chairman), Huang Junke, and Li Jinsong for the Chinese side; and Merkulov (chairman), Shi Xuan, and Gubarov for the Russian side. They held two meetings on the 10th and 12th. Due to intense disputes over the proposals, no results have been achieved as of today. Today, it was decided that meetings would be held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, with the remaining days for preparation. This is the current situation of the telegraph portion of the meeting. It is unknown how the disputes will unfold during the telephone discussions in the future. The Chinese proposal and the Russian response are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Proposal (A): Outline of Proposals for the Meeting on Telegraph, Telephone, and Long-Distance Telephone Matters along the Eastern Railway Line between the Northeast Transportation Committee and the Eastern Railway: (1) Sino-Soviet international telegrams should be entirely dispatched via Chinese lines, connecting with the Soviet Union at the border, and a separate contract should be signed with the Soviet Union's Postal and Telecommunications Committee. (2) The Railway Bureau should immediately cease accepting and dispatching commercial telegrams and telephone calls, including long-distance calls, at all locations along the Eastern Railway line where China has already established or plans to establish offices. (3) In locations along the Eastern Railway line where China has not yet established offices, the Railway Bureau should continue to accept telegrams, telephone calls, and long-distance calls on behalf of China, and a joint-line contract should be established. (4) China should have the right to inspect telegrams sent out of the country at any time and place. (5) Both sides should declare the abolition of the contract of November 22, 1922. The details of the above items should be discussed by the special committee at any time, and then decided by the general meeting. (B) Detailed Proposals for the Meeting on Telegraph Matters along the Eastern Railway Line between the Northeast Transportation Committee and the Eastern Railway Board of Directors: (1) All telegrams between the China Eastern Special Region and the Soviet Union, regardless of whether they are used by the Eastern Railway or private individuals, should be handled by the Chinese Telecommunications Bureau within Chinese territory. However, for the convenience of use, the Chinese Telecommunications Authority agrees to negotiate separate measures for railway official telegrams between the Eastern Railway and the Ussuri Railway of the Soviet Union. (2) The lines and equipment remaining after the Eastern Railway ceases accepting and dispatching commercial telegrams should be transferred or leased to the Chinese Telecommunications Authority for use at a fair price when necessary. (3) The Eastern Railway and the Soviet Union should introduce and facilitate the establishment of an international telegraph joint-line contract between the Chinese Telecommunications Authority and the Soviet Russian Telecommunications Authority. (4) The price of telegrams between the China Eastern Special Region and the Soviet Union should be determined separately by China and the Soviet Union, and the total sum of the two should be charged to the sender. (5) Telegrams between the China Eastern Special Region and the Soviet Union should be handled in accordance with the International Telegraph Convention and its operational rules. (6) The Chinese Telecommunications Authority should establish offices to handle private telegrams to and from larger stations along the Eastern Railway, as well as all international telegrams. For private telegrams to and from smaller stations, the Chinese Telecommunications Authority should entrust the Eastern Railway to handle them on its behalf. The names of the stations entrusted should be specified and notified by the Chinese Telecommunications Authority. After the railway receives these entrusted telegrams, it should transfer them to the nearest Chinese Telegraph Bureau for relay. A separate contract for railway-telegraph connection methods should be established for compliance. This contract should be handled in accordance with the regulations of the state-owned railway-telegraph connection methods stipulated by the Chinese Ministry of Communications. (7) For telegrams entrusted to the Eastern Railway for relay, the Chinese Telecommunications Authority should pay the Eastern Railway a line fee of two cents (silver dollar) per word for Chinese and foreign commercial telegrams, six cents (silver dollar) per word for urgent telegrams, and one cent (silver dollar) per word for Chinese official and news telegrams. (8) The price of private telegrams entrusted to the Eastern Railway should be determined by the Chinese Telecommunications Authority and notified to the Eastern Railway for collection. The line fee should be deducted from this price. (9) The settlement of accounts and payments for fees between the two parties should be cleared monthly by the Eastern Railway in Harbin with the agency designated by the Chinese Telecommunications Authority. The cash to be paid to each other should be paid directly before the 15th of the following month. (10) The Chinese Telecommunications Authority may send personnel to be stationed in each telegraph room of the Eastern Railway to inspect all telegrams received and sent by the Eastern Railway at any time.</p>
<p>Russian Response Regarding Eastern Railway Telegraph Matters, Answers to the Detailed Items of the Chinese Proposal: (1) Regarding the answer to the first item, the Board of Directors' resolution of April 18th of this year clearly instructs the Eastern Railway to hand over only the portion limited to receiving and dispatching commercial telegrams to the Chinese Telecommunications Authority for independent operation. As for the exchange of official telegrams between this railway and the various railways of the Soviet Union, it is difficult to submit it for discussion. Therefore, the method of using official telegrams between this railway and the Ussuri Railway should not be proposed for discussion between the Railway Bureau and the Chinese Telecommunications Authority. Therefore, the first item of the proposal should be amended as follows: All commercial telegrams between the Chinese Special Region and the Soviet Union, whether sent to or from the Eastern Railway, and all telegrams sent by private individuals, should be handled independently by the Chinese Telecommunications Authority within Chinese territory. (2) Regarding the answer to the second item, the Board of Directors' resolution of April 18th of this year does not stipulate that this railway may transfer the railway's telegraph lines or other railway equipment to the Chinese Telecommunications Authority for management according to the principles of purchase or lease. Moreover, the original intention of this railway to cease accepting and dispatching commercial telegrams stems from the development of business and the abundance of official telegrams, and there is no redundant portion. Therefore, the third item of the detailed proposals of the Chinese Telecommunications Authority should be deleted. Regarding such issues, the Telecommunications Authority should submit another proposal directly to the Board of Directors or this Bureau. (3) Regarding the answer to the third item, the exchange of international telegraph agreements between China and the Soviet Union is not within the scope of the duties of the Eastern Railway and Soviet Union representatives, so it should be deleted. (4) Regarding the answer to the fourth item, the Board of Directors' resolution specifies in detail that the price of telegrams between the Special Zone and the Soviet Union should not exceed 22 kopecks in gold currency per word for ordinary commercial telegrams, and 66 kopecks in gold currency per word for urgent telegrams. The amount to be obtained by each party should be allocated by a special committee organized by this railway and the Telecommunications Authority. Therefore, the fourth item is proposed to be amended as follows: The price of commercial telegrams between the Special Zone and the Soviet Union will still be charged to the sender at 22 kopecks in gold currency per word for ordinary telegrams and 66 kopecks in gold currency per word for urgent telegrams. The percentage to be allocated between the two parties will be determined by the committee. (5) Regarding the answer to the fifth item, the regulation of telegraph business methods between the Chinese Telecommunications Authority and the Soviet Union Postal and Telecommunications Committee is not within the scope of the duties of this Bureau, so the original fifth item should be deleted. (6) Regarding the answer to the sixth item, this item can be handled in accordance with the method stipulated by the Chinese Ministry of Communications for the state-owned railway-telegraph joint line, except for the part concerning the Eastern Railway's use of it. However, the phrase "If the aforementioned method is presented by the Chinese Telecommunications Authority and does not conflict with the regulations of this railway for receiving and dispatching telegrams, it may be used for reference" should be added. In addition, regarding the method for passengers and railway customers to send telegrams from the Eastern Railway stations using the railway's telegraph lines," therefore, the sixth item is proposed to be amended as follows: The Chinese Telecommunications Authority should establish offices to handle private telegrams to and from larger stations along the Eastern Railway, as well as all international telegrams. For private telegrams to and from smaller stations, the Chinese Telecommunications Authority should entrust the Eastern Railway to handle them on its behalf. The names of the stations entrusted should be specified and notified by the Chinese Telecommunications Authority. After the railway receives these entrusted telegrams, it should transfer them to the nearest Chinese Telegraph Bureau for relay. A separate contract for railway-telegraph connection methods should be established for compliance. This contract should be handled by referring to the state-owned railway-telegraph connection methods stipulated by the Chinese Ministry of Communications. However, commercial telegrams sent directly to stations within the boundaries of the Eastern Railway by customers of the Eastern Railway or their passengers at the Eastern Railway stations will be received and sent by the Eastern Railway's telegraph lines. (7) Regarding the answer to the seventh item, the amount of the line fee for telegrams relayed by the Eastern Railway must be discussed and determined in detail by a special committee. Therefore, the provisions of this item regarding the number of line fees should be deleted. Therefore, it is proposed to amend it as follows: For telegrams entrusted to the Eastern Railway for relay, the Chinese Telecommunications Authority should pay the Eastern Railway a line fee, and the amount of the line fee will be determined by the committee. (8) Regarding the answer to the eighth item, it should be clearly stated that the Chinese Telecommunications Authority can only stipulate the price of commercial telegrams within the Special Zone and international telegrams excluding the Soviet Union. Because the price of Soviet telegrams has already been stipulated and cannot be changed by the order of the Chinese Telecommunications Authority. In addition, regarding the method of settling accounts for cash commercial telegrams exchanged exclusively on the Eastern Railway's telegraph lines, this railway can only pay the Chinese Telecommunications Authority's sovereignty fee for such telegrams. Therefore, the eighth item is proposed to be amended as follows: For commercial telegrams within the Special Zone and international telegrams excluding those sent to the Soviet Union that are entrusted to the Eastern Railway for handling, the amount should be determined by the Chinese Telecommunications Authority and notified to the Eastern Railway Bureau for collection. The line fee will be deducted from this price. The amount of the sovereignty fee that should be paid to the Chinese Telecommunications Authority for commercial telegrams received and sent exclusively by the Eastern Railway will be determined by the committee. (9) Regarding the answer to the ninth item, regarding this point, the Chinese side proposed that the deadline for payment of fees by both parties should be before the 15th of the month following the settlement, which is too short. It is not possible to complete the remittance of accounts from various stations, the preparation of the balance sheet, and the completion of verification by both parties within the 15-day period. Therefore, the accounting period must be decided by the committee before it can be stipulated. Therefore, the ninth item is proposed to be amended as follows: The settlement of accounts for fees between the two parties should be cleared monthly in Harbin by the Eastern Railway and the Chinese Telecommunications Authority. The cash that should be paid to each other should be paid directly within the period stipulated by the committee. (10) Regarding the answer to the tenth item, the Board of Directors resolved on April 18th of this year that the Chinese Telecommunications Authority will inspect the telegrams transferred by the railway's telegraph lines in the future. Therefore, the Chinese Telecommunications Authority should not stipulate a method of stationing personnel in the bureau for inspection at any time. Therefore, the original tenth item should be deleted.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Petition by Residents of Xinbin County, Liaoning Province <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang dispatch: The residents of the eighth district of Xinbin County, due to their unwillingness to be placed under the jurisdiction of Qingyuan County, have repeatedly appealed without success, arousing public indignation. 1200 representatives of the district residents walked to the provincial capital to petition the provincial chairman in order to achieve their goal. The residents departed from the county and arrived in Shenyang after a journey of fourteen days, arriving in the provincial capital on the evening of the 13th. Xinbin County Magistrate Yi Wenchen had previously telegraphed the provincial government. Zang Shiyi, based on the telegram, believed that the arrival of a large number of residents from the county would pose a threat to public order and required proper care. He verbally instructed Shenyang County Magistrate Wang Jiarui on the night of the 13th to send representatives to comfort the residents and prevent disturbances. County Magistrate Wang Jiarui immediately dispatched Zhang Detang, the director of the county public security bureau, to lead a team to the vicinity of Dongling to settle them separately and provide guidance. He also ordered the residents to reside there temporarily. At dawn today, Wang Jiarui, accompanied by Bai Yuling, the captain of the public security brigade, went to offer condolences. He gathered the residents in the courtyard of the Fuling Elementary School and held talks with ten representatives, including You. The representatives stated the reasons for the boundary division and the reasons for their opposition, and requested to see the provincial chairman. The county magistrate explained earnestly, and the representatives agreed. He then gathered all the residents for a speech, saying: "I am Wang Jiarui, the county magistrate of Shenyang County. Today, I represent the provincial chairman to express my condolences to you. On the one hand, I am fulfilling my responsibility as the host to maintain order, and on the other hand, I am here to guide you. You are good people, and because of the boundary division, you have left your homes and traveled to the provincial capital to petition, which is certainly a hardship. The state establishes officials and divides governance for the well-being of the people. Xinbin and Qingyuan, dividing boundaries, whether belonging to one or the other, are all within the scope of our Liaoning province. The provincial government has no prejudice on this matter. Moreover, our Northeast has a commander-in-chief presiding over it, and there are many wise assistants, all dedicated to seeking the people's well-being. If the people have illnesses, they will surely find ways to eliminate them. I will lead your representatives to see the provincial chairman to state your grievances, and you will surely come with hardship and leave with satisfaction. Now, the Northeast is surrounded by powerful neighbors, and the people must unite, and officials and people must merge into one to resist foreign insults and maintain the survival of our nation." The residents immediately cheered the slogan "Long live our wise officials." Then, the director of the public security bureau dispatched personnel to guide them to stay nearby. More than ten representatives were selected by the residents and led by Director Zhang into the city to gather at the county government. County Magistrate Wang led them to meet with the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs and the Provincial Chairman to state their opinions. The representatives also requested that vehicles be dispatched from the Shenhai Railway to transport all the residents back to their hometown to settle down, as it is the busy farming season. It is reported that the authorities have accepted the opinions of the residents. (May 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Difficulties Remain for Immigrants from Zhejiang Province <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang dispatch: The Liaoning Provincial Government has resolved to accept immigrants from Zhejiang Province and distribute them to various counties for settlement. A batch of more than 300 refugees arrived a few days ago and landed in Yingkou. The provincial government ordered the county to settle them nearby in the farmland belonging to the Tianzhuangtai people. The Zhejiang Provincial Immigration Committee, Li Guangyu, also negotiated and reached a compromise with the Liaoning Provincial Government on the funds for purchasing agricultural tools, seeds, livestock, and building houses, agreeing to advance 30,000 yuan for all applications. The handling is still going smoothly. However, the immigrants, having lived in prosperous areas for a long time, are not accustomed to the simple life outside the Guanwai region, especially the sorghum rice, which they cannot fill their stomachs with. They requested to eat rice, or each person must be given 30 yuan in travel expenses to return to Zhejiang. Committee Member Li has contacted the provincial government several times, but there is no solution. Committee Member Li telegraphed Zhejiang for instructions today. The original telegram is as follows: "Zhu Junjian, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs of Zhejiang Province, reports on the progress of immigration. The Liaoning Provincial Government agreed to advance 30,000 yuan for building houses, purchasing agricultural tools, seeds, and livestock. However, the Zhejiang people want to eat rice, or each person must be given 30 yuan to return to Zhejiang. The Liaoning Provincial Government heard this and intends to ignore it. The local area is also afraid and dare not accept them. After several explanations and attempts to smooth things over, the blow is not small. Now the Liaoning Provincial Government wants our side to be responsible for providing food from now until autumn. How to proceed? Please telegraph instructions, Li Guangzi kowtows in the cold."

<h3 id="e70">Imperial Prince Chichibu of Japan Arrives in Shenyang <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang dispatch: Imperial Prince Chichibu, the younger brother of the Japanese Showa Emperor, came to tour the Eastern Provinces with the students of the National Army University to inspect the battlefields of the Russo-Japanese War. He arrived in Shenyang by special train at noon on the 13th. The Japanese Consul-General stationed in Shenyang, the Governor of Kwantung, the Commander of the Kwantung Army, the President of the South Manchuria Railway, and the military, business groups, and school students residing in Manchuria all gathered in the large square in the Naniwa-dori Fuji-cho area to welcome him. The representatives of our side who welcomed him were Wang Shuchang (Director of the Military Orders Department) and Tao Shangming (Secretary of the Border Affairs Office), dispatched by Zhang Xueliang, the Commander of the Northeast Border Defense, and Wang Jinghuan (Special Envoy for Eastern Province Negotiations), Chen Wenxue (Director of the Department of Civil Affairs), and Bai Mingzhen (Director of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau), dispatched by Zang Shiyi, the Chairman of the Provincial Government.

At 12:05, he boarded a specially prepared car from the South Manchuria Railway, accompanied by more than 20 cars of Japanese officials, and departed for Fengtian Shrine (the place where the bones of Japanese soldiers who died in the Russo-Japanese War were buried). As the car passed through Naniwa-dori, Imperial Prince Chichibu returned the greetings of the Japanese residents who were welcoming him. At that time, every Japanese merchant and resident along the road hung Japanese flags and arranged lanterns. When Imperial Prince Chichibu's car passed, the traffic of ordinary people was ordered to avoid it by the Japanese police. After Imperial Prince Chichibu visited the shrine, he went to the Chureito Pagoda on Chiyoda-dori to pay his respects. Ogura, the director of the South Manchuria Railway local office, explained the history and origin of this pagoda. Imperial Prince Chichibu returned to the Yamato Hotel at 12:23. The students of the National Army University who came with him got off the train and stayed at hotels such as Daisei and Daimaru. At 8:00 a.m. on the 14th, Imperial Prince Chichibu went to Wenguantun to visit the battlefields of the Russo-Japanese War, accompanied by the students of the National Army University.

<p>Opposition to the Scheduled Additional Levy: The county administrative meeting this year was held because of the insufficient funds for May and June of the 18th year. Therefore, the additional levy for the 19th year was linked to it. The entire meeting confirmed it, using the original levy of two dimes and five cents as the standard. Now, people from various districts, such as Ruan and Wu, believe that the procedures for the additional levy should first determine the purpose and then inspect the autumn harvest before it can be discussed. They believe that this move is inappropriate and have already asked the county government to postpone the re-discussion after the 18th-year final accounts have been audited. The Promulgation of the Zhenxiang Police Regulations: The Zhenxiang Police are renamed from the previous Tu Liang Bao. Its interim regulations have been revised and promulgated by the Finance Bureau. Its authority is dedicated to collecting taxes and levies from each Tu Mang Cao Lu. The funds collected should be recorded in the issued payment slips and verified monthly.</p>
<p>Recent News on Negotiations in the Counterfeit Drug Case: Gu Shijian, the investigation director of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association, previously discovered counterfeit drugs at the Tonghe Pharmacy in Sanguantang. He was kidnapped and imprisoned midway by thugs led by the pharmacy, who took back the drugs. The county public security bureau intervened and stopped it upon hearing the news. At that time, a disaster was avoided. However, recently, the pharmacy not only did not repent but also made false statements and threatened to withdraw from the association, causing great public outrage. According to the association's report on the truth of the investigation, it had received several reports about the pharmacy selling counterfeit drugs. Because it was afraid that there might be inaccuracies, before the investigation, it first suspended a formula and sent someone to fill it, and to show impartiality, it inspected it on the spot in the town's teahouse. It was found that the fresh gold dou opened by the prescription used Jualan and stone crabs as substitutes for Shehan stone. Other Sichuan Lian flavors were even more counterfeit, and the quantity did not meet the standards. The price was as high as one yuan and three cents, which was extremely illegal. It is now learned that the association, in addition to reporting to the county party headquarters, has convened the industry to decide to ask the county to order the closure of the pharmacy to serve as a warning.</p>

<p>Welcoming and Detaining Informants in the Sijing Robbery Case: Gui Zicheng and two other informants of the bandits who robbed Sijing Town have been arrested by the Shanghai Public Concession Bureau and handed over to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for interrogation. The Sijing Town Chamber of Commerce and the Yangqi District Office learned of this and specially submitted a petition to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters requesting that they be returned to the original county for trial. The garrison headquarters approved the request. The town's chamber of commerce and district office have prepared a report to send police to Shanghai to welcome and detain them. Tai Bao A Xu Interrogates Lake Bandits in Qianwei: The original part of Tai Bao A Xu's department had four or five hundred people, divided into thirty ships. Seeing that the bandit suppression army was pursuing them vigorously, they declared the disbandment of the gang and hid in the coastal villages of Punan, waiting for an opportunity to move. Recently, according to people from Jinshanwei, the gang has gathered again, and the number of people is even greater than before. They once went out to sea, but they returned because they were not accustomed to the water and soil. They have now landed and are reportedly entrenched in the Qianjiawei area of Jinshan County, occupying Liu's Embankment Bridge and even planting flags and posting sentries. Their momentum can be seen.</p>

<p>Buying Cattle Leads to a Fatal Case: Shen Ada, who has been a cattle dealer in Nanxiang for many years, recently went to Xiaonanxiang with a buyer to buy cattle. He argued with Lu, who owned the cattle, for a while, and they fought. Shen Ada punched Lu once, and people persuaded them to stop. Unexpectedly, Lu died the next day. His family gathered and, together with the local township police, went to Shen's place to negotiate and handed him over to Hua, the director of the Nanxiang Public Security Bureau.

<p>Reconstruction of the Third Prison Branch Office, Wuxian Hengjie. The internal buildings of the Jiangsu Third Prison Branch Office are dilapidated and in poor condition. The original quota for accommodating prisoners was 200, but there are currently about 300 prisoners, which is very crowded. President Lin of the High Court, in view of this, has drafted a plan to rebuild the branch office into ten new-style prison cells. He has already appointed Secretary-General Wei Bangzhen and four others to draw up plans and engage workers for construction. Furthermore, President Lin recently drafted a plan to survey the original site of the old copper coin bureau inside Panmen Gate to build a branch prison. He has sent a letter to the provincial government for review. Once approved, construction must also be actively carried out to alleviate the overcrowding of prisoners in various prisons. A large number of counter-revolutionary prisoners were transferred to the Suzhou High Court. Yesterday (the 18th), the Tongshan County authorities transferred counter-revolutionary prisoners Wang Zongchi, Wang Zhaomeng, Li Jian, Dai Hanxia, Zhang Xiacun, Sun Yuqian, Wang Timing, Zhu Dunjie, Wang Zonggui, and female prisoner Wang Jingxiao, a total of ten people. After receiving them, the High Court sent them to the Third Branch Prison Detention Center for custody and scheduled interrogation.</p>
<p>The District Court Tried a Blackmail Case Involving Soil Merchants. Wu Shaowu, former Captain of the Second Squad of the Wuxian Police Force, along with Yu Jinzhou and Chen Shouzhang, Chiefs of the Water Patrol Team, extorted 1,000 yuan from soil merchant Wang Waitou. Yu and Chen were arrested and handed over to the District Court for punishment according to law. Wu Shaowu fled and is wanted by the District Court. The District Court Procuratorate scheduled a hearing for yesterday (the 19th) and summoned Wang Waitou to court for questioning. Wang did not appear in court due to fear of guilt. After the opening, the court adjourned and rescheduled the hearing, as it was still necessary to summon all parties involved. Silk Filature in Various Rural Areas Open in Succession. Although there is a new organization such as the Zaoshi market outside Xumen Gate for this year's Suzhou silk filature, the total is still two-tenths less than last year. Currently, the Xijin Bridge and other places opened on the 18th, but the arrival of goods is not crowded, and the price is around 55 yuan. If neighboring villages do not compete for purchases, it will be difficult for the cocoon price to see an improvement. Mu Du, Guangfu, Xiangshan, and other places also opened uniformly on the 19th, with the reported initial price set at 55 yuan for secondary goods. However, foreign varieties are divided into three grades, with the highest initial price set at 90 yuan, and the others priced according to the quality of the goods. Furthermore, Japanese merchants have established silk filature in Guangfu and other places to absorb fresh cocoons. The Suzhou Rural Sericulture Cooperative specially convened a meeting of villagers to not sell fresh cocoons to Japanese merchants in order to protect profit rights.</p>

<p>Request to Examine a Nine-Year-Old Murder Case. On the evening of the 17th, Jiang Baolang from Qingning Sand, Nansha District, along with witnesses Wang Guanpei and Li Qiaoming, went to the county to file a lawsuit, requesting the exhumation and re-examination of a nine-year-old murder case. Hearing Officer Shi questioned them in court. Jiang Baolang stated that in the spring of 1920, Guangji Zhi Company was building a new dike in Shazhou, and his father, Jiang Genyun, was killed. At the time, it was only known that he was injured by suppression officers. A report was filed with the county requesting an examination. Now, nine years later, the fugitive murderer Zhu returned to Sha from Shanghai to make a living. According to Wang Guanpei and Li Qiaoming, his father was not killed by a gunshot wound but was poisoned after being injured by Xu Zhong, who force-fed him opium and alcohol. He requested the exhumation and examination of the body to seek redress for the injustice. Witnesses Wang Guanpei and Li Qiaoming stated that in the spring of 1920, Jiang Genyun was injured while working on dike construction for Guangye Company. The company sent people to guard the injured. At night, Xu Zhong used opium and fire-brand, threatening to force-feed Jiang Genyun, resulting in his death. At the time, Xu Zhong secretly instructed them not to publicize the matter and promised to support them for life. Now, Xu suddenly went back on his word, so they informed the deceased's son and went to the county to request the exhumation and re-examination of the body and the arrest of the murderer. Hearing Officer Shi ordered that Xu Zhong be summoned for a joint interrogation to clarify the matter before further action. It is learned that in the spring of 1920, Guangye Company was building a dike, and hundreds of sand dwellers demanded land from the company. Suppression officers fired shots to maintain order, resulting in Jiang Genyun suffering gunshot wounds near the top of his head and the left corner of his forehead, and then dying. After reporting to the county, the former County Magistrate Yang Mengling went to Shazhou to examine the body and file a report, and separate arrest warrants were issued.</p>

Before leaving, they tied up Ma and his wife, daughter, and two apprentices and hid the kidnapped victims inside the boat. At that time, a patrol boat from the Anti-Smuggling Camp happened to be passing by. The patrolmen spotted it and ordered the boat to stop for inspection. The bandits opened fire, killing one anti-smuggling patrolman and injuring two others, surnamed Dai and Zhou. The bandit boat brazenly escaped. The next day, the anti-smuggling patrol officer sent the two injured men to Jishan Hospital for treatment and reported the incident to the Public Security Bureau, requesting assistance in the capture.</p>

<p>The Inside Story of the Embezzlement of Compensation Funds from the May 30th Massacre. Regarding the embezzlement of compensation funds for the family of Shi Songsheng, a victim from our county in the May 30th Massacre, after years of negotiations by the Massacre Relief Association, 2,000 yuan was finally allocated from the 195,000 yuan paid by the Public Works Department last winter. At that time, Shi Wang, the mother of Songsheng, and her eldest daughter-in-law, Shi Ding, came to Shanghai and enlisted the help of their relative Hu Zongyu and Zhang Jieshou (also known as Zhang Chengyue), an employee of the Shangyu Association in Shanghai, to collect the funds in the name of the Association. Later, Shi Wang only received 300 yuan and returned to her hometown in disappointment. As a result, public opinion was in an uproar. The matter came to the attention of He Wuliang, a fellow countryman from Shangyu in Shanghai, who reported it to the Massacre Relief Association. After a thorough investigation by the Association, it was revealed that in addition to the Shangyu Association in Shanghai admitting to raising 500 yuan, Hu Zongyu deducting 124 yuan for advances, Hu's brother-in-law Wang Jinlong receiving 100 yuan, and the family receiving a net of 750 yuan, the rest was all embezzled by Zhang Jieshou. Furthermore, according to Songsheng's brother, Songquan, after the funds were received, Hu Zongyu sent an anonymous letter to the Relief Association, stating that the recipient of the funds was not a member of Songsheng's family. When the Association investigated, Zhang Jieshou had already secretly returned to his hometown. Upon hearing the news, he threatened Songquan and forced his mother and Songsheng's stepson, Zhang Fu, to publish a clarifying statement in the newspaper. Hu Zongyu was still not satisfied and directly published a statement in the Shangyu Sheng Bao, clarifying his personal situation and listing the use of the funds. Among them, the amount of money differed from the information obtained by the Massacre Relief Association during its investigation, namely that the Shangyu Association in Shanghai raised 750 yuan and the total amount received by Songsheng's family was 1,026 yuan (including 320 yuan for Songsheng's mother, including travel expenses, and 306 yuan for his stepson, Zhang Fu, including other expenses, and 400 yuan for his sister-in-law, Shi Ding). Hu Zongyu also said that if the Association could return half of the funds to the Shi family, he would be willing to return the advances he had deducted in full. Another version is that Zhang Jieshou extorted 600 yuan in his own name from the 2,000 yuan compensation funds, which led to Liu Xiaotian's advertisement apologizing to the members of the Association. Zhang had no choice but to spit out 250 yuan of the funds he had swallowed to help the Association cover up the accounts overnight in order to avoid social criticism. However, fellow countrymen in both Yu and Shanghai disliked him, and a public prosecution has recently been initiated. As for Shi's relatives, they all blamed Shi's mother, saying that the compensation funds for Songsheng's life should not have been donated to a charitable association. Furthermore, Songsheng's second brother, Peizhi, and his wife had disputes over unequal rights, leading to conflicts between mother and son, brothers, and uncle and sister-in-law, and litigation seemed inevitable.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 19th. The Chinese Association for the Advancement of Physical Education hopes to raise 20,000 yuan from the overseas Chinese in Tokyo to cover the athletes' accommodation and food expenses in Tokyo. However, in recent years, the business of overseas Chinese has been poor. Although Minister Wang Rongbao is very enthusiastic and has already instructed consuls in various places to encourage donations from local overseas Chinese, only nearly 10,000 yuan has been raised so far. Among them, the overseas Chinese in Kobe and Osaka are the most enthusiastic. Supervisors from the Ministry of Education, managers of students studying abroad from various provinces, and the Kuomintang and other organizations have also generously donated.</p>

<p>Emperor's Attendance</p>
<p>(Tokyo Correspondence) The Japan Sports Association believes that the Far Eastern Games are one of the world's most important sports events and a symbol of the unity of the Eastern race, and its significance is profound. Everyone knows this. Last year, the Emperor attended the Meiji Jingu Games. This year's Far Eastern Games are even more important than before. Therefore, the Sports Association decided to send the president of the Games, Dr. Kishi Seiichi, to the palace to request the Emperor's presence to encourage the athletes from the three countries. If the Emperor agrees, the Ministry of Education will submit a formal request.</p>

<p>| Japan Sports Association Prepares to Welcome Athletes |</p>
<p>(Tokyo Correspondence) The Japan Sports Association held a general affairs committee meeting at the Tokyo Marunouchi Office on the evening of the 14th. All department heads and committee members were present and decided to hold an East Asian Friendship Association at the Hibiya Public Hall in Tokyo when athletes from various countries arrive, to entertain the representatives of the four countries and broadcast the exchange of events at the venue to the whole country via wireless radio. It will also invite the general representatives of the four countries to give speeches. As for the entrance tickets for the Games, they will be sold at eleven locations in Tokyo starting from the 15th. Tickets for baseball, basketball, volleyball, etc. will be one yuan each. On the day of the opening ceremony, if the venue is full, ticket sales will be stopped. Although the Meiji Jingu venue can accommodate 200,000 spectators, it is feared that it will be crowded, so there are restrictions and quotas on various entrance tickets.</p>

Those who are skilled in sports have also risen enthusiastically and organized a colleagues' sports meet. Since the 14th of this month, various preliminary rounds have been held at the YMCA. Due to work commitments, the 14th and 15th both started after 5:00 PM and 8:00 PM to ensure that work and sports do not interfere with each other.

<p>The Yinghua Academy volleyball team was unwilling to accept defeat after losing to Nanyang High School of Commerce last time. Therefore, they fought again at the Nanyang High School of Commerce field yesterday. Both sides made every effort to fight to the death. However, Nanyang High School of Commerce had representatives who attended the National Games on behalf of Jiangsu and had rich experience in long battles. Although the Yinghua team is also a strong team in Shanghai, it is inferior to Nanyang High School of Commerce. Therefore, the result was two to one, and victory still belonged to Nanyang High School of Commerce.</p>

In the second game, Mingde reorganized its forces and fought bravely, taking the lead in scoring. However, Tonghui quickly caught up and took the lead, reaching 11 points first.

<p>(Hu Shuyi)</p>
<p>The Empire of Japan is located in eastern Asia and is composed of the main islands of Japan, the Korean Peninsula, and the islands of Taiwan and the South Seas. Its total area, including invaded territories, is approximately 436 million square Japanese ri. The main islands of Japan account for a little more than one-third of the total area, so the true area of Japan is only about 15 million square Japanese ri. Since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has learned the strengths of Western material civilization and unexpectedly defeated our country in one war, and then defeated powerful Russia in another war, gaining the status of a powerful country in the East. Its rapid progress has amazed the world. Our country is separated from it by a narrow strip of water, and the neighboring relationship is very close. As the ancient saying goes, "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." Therefore, it is necessary to conduct in-depth research on Japan. I have heard that Japanese elementary school teachers often use our country as the only teaching material for children. What is their intention? On the other hand, some people in our country advocate friendship, while others advocate jealousy. One call elicits a hundred responses. However, in fact, few people can truly observe the subtleties of the situation in Japan. The author believes that to understand the underlying meaning of Japan's success, we should start with on-the-spot investigations. Education is the foundation of a nation, and we cannot talk about education without studying the education of that country. Elementary schools are the foundation of education at all levels, so we should pay special attention to studying the elementary education of that country. I have had this ambition for a long time, but I have been traveling abroad for many years, driven by hunger in all directions, and I have been unable to make it happen. Last month, I was pleased to learn that the Beijing Municipal Government had specially appointed Mr. Gu Yinting, the former Director of the Education Bureau, to investigate Japanese education. I then discussed the matter with him to travel together, and I was also grateful for the approval of leave from the Director of the Jiangsu Education Department. With this opportunity, I was very happy, so I prepared everything within ten days and bid farewell to my parents in my hometown, who also gladly approved of this action. In Beijing, friends and relatives held banquets for me, including Lu Jun and Lin Jun from the Finance Department, Mu Jun from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Shao Jun and Xie Jun from the Beijing Municipal Government, Ba Jun from the Construction Committee, and all my colleagues at the school. They all gave me words of caution and encouragement, for which I am deeply ashamed. I originally planned to go to Shanghai on May 11 and take the Shanghai Maru to Japan on the 13th. On the morning of the 11th, the Beijing office of this newspaper kindly sent me to the Xiaguan Station by car. My wife, Xiufang, and my nephew, Situn, and my child, Siltu, accompanied me. Siltu, who was only three years old, jumped and cheered in the car, frequently asking his mother if he could go with me wherever I went. At that time, the train was about to depart, and the whistle urged the passengers to get off the car. So I personally sent them to the platform and onto the car, waved goodbye, and was reluctant to leave. As the ancients said, "What is most heartbreaking is parting." It is true. In the train car, I met Mr. and Mrs. Luqin and Mr. Tianhan and his brother, who were all going to Shanghai to go to Japan together. We talked about matters related to going to Japan, and the journey was not lonely. After arriving in Shanghai, I visited Mr. Yinting and learned that he had changed to a French mail ship, which was scheduled to depart at noon on the 12th. I hurriedly purchased the items that should be prepared for going to Japan and went to the China Merchants Bureau in Outer Hongkou to board the French mail ship. Mr. Chen Heting, Shen Zhongyue, Yao Zhongqing, and other gentlemen from the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau were there to see me off. At that time, it was drizzling, and the gentlemen who were seeing me off waved their hands and raised their hats three or four times, showing great kindness, for which I am deeply grateful. The name of the ship was General Metzinger, weighing 15,000 tons. The staff on the ship were all French, and I could understand the conversations in English. In the evening, I drafted a form for educational inspection, with the following format: 1. School name, 2. Nature, 3. School address, 4. Location, 5. Principal, 6. School aspect, 7. School history, 8. Number of students, 9. School buildings, including classrooms, dormitories, offices, auditoriums, playgrounds, kitchens, etc. (6 categories), 10. Expenses, including income and expenditure (2 categories), 11. Faculty and staff, including quantity, teachers, staff, salary levels, boarding and lodging, and qualifications (7 categories), 12. Grade organization, 13. Tuition fees, 14. Teaching methods, 15. Interviews with important staff. The rain stopped in the evening, and the moon came out, adding many poetic materials to the night scene at sea. The lone traveler could not help but feel nostalgic. At that time, the sea breeze was getting stronger, and the silver waves and snow waves made the ship unstable. Before I knew it, I had already entered the East China Sea.

<p>Uniforms Cannot Be Used as School Uniforms</p>
<p>The Municipal Training Department sends a letter to the Boy Scout Headquarters to order a ban (Central News Agency). The Training Department of the Nanjing Special City Executive Committee believes that the Boy Scout cause is very noble. However, it has recently been found that some schools in various places that have not established Boy Scout troops are using Boy Scout uniforms as school uniforms, or individual students are wearing them at will, competing to show off. If this phenomenon is not strictly investigated, it will greatly hinder the future of the Boy Scout cause. Yesterday, in accordance with Article 23, Item E of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the General Regulations of the Chinese Kuomintang Boy Scouts, it was stipulated that those who are not qualified to be Boy Scouts and those who have not been formally registered after review and approval shall not use the Boy Scout uniform. The Training Department sent a letter to the Chinese Boy Scout Headquarters to order a strict ban throughout the country in accordance with laws and regulations.</p>

<p>Will Hold Second Session of Teacher Training</p>
<p>The Jiangsu County Compulsory Education Preparatory Joint Office's first session of teacher training correspondence department is about to graduate. Because Jiangyin, Baoshan, Liyang, and other counties have requested that a second session be continued to create more opportunities, the office, to be cautious, sent a letter to the Jiangsu 61 County Education Bureaus to seek their opinions. The letter is as follows: "Our office believes that in order to promote compulsory education, we should pay attention to teacher training. We have accepted the entrustment of various counties to run the first session of the teacher training correspondence department, and we have compiled and printed a general overview of the situation and sent it to various counties for reference. The Jiangsu Provincial Education Department has also published a recent overview of Jiangsu education, which includes the 1,023 students in this session by county, defining it as a type of teacher training undertaking. It has been found that the students in this session are nearing graduation, and many teachers in various counties have sent letters inquiring about the procedures for continuing the session. Furthermore, the education bureaus of Jiangyin, Baoshan, Liyang, and other counties have previously reported that many students have not been able to participate. The average number of unqualified teachers in the province is still more than double the number of qualified teachers. It is unacceptable to fill positions with unqualified teachers, and it is even more difficult to dismiss them without using them. Therefore, the former Executive Yuan of Zhongda has stipulated measures for unqualified teacher training classes, ordering various counties to comply. However, it is feared that if each county handles it independently, the human resources and funding will not be sufficient. Moreover, it is difficult to temporarily transfer a large number of teachers, not only causing sudden panic in the livelihoods of the teachers, but also making it difficult to fill the original positions. Therefore, according to the principle of joint management obtained from the original admission measures and the precedent of approving Jiangning County to use correspondence courses in case of difficulties, it was unanimously agreed at the meeting of the heads of various county bureaus to organize a teacher training correspondence department. Since its implementation, it has been well-received by the education community, resulting in numerous requests to participate. To be cautious, we are again seeking the consent of various counties as to whether it is still necessary to continue running the second session. Please immediately cross out one line on the attached reply card and send it to our office by a set date so that we can actively prepare. This matter concerns teacher training, and we sincerely hope that your bureau will provide practical leadership.</p>

<p>The Shanghai government decided to launch a literacy campaign at the 36th County Administration Conference. It is now scheduled to begin today (the 20th), and county government staff members Huang Chengbo and chief editor Mai Guanqun have been appointed to go to the countryside on a daily basis to guide the implementation together with the chiefs of each district. The schedule is set for the 20th in Minhang Town, the 21st in Cao Hangtangwan, the 22nd in Beiqiao Town, the 23rd in Sanlin Town, the 24th in Chen Hangzhuanqiao, and the 25th in Maqiao Town, for a total of five days of campaigns.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Ma Junwu Takes Office as Principal of Zhonggong School <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Hu Shih's Resignation</p>
<p>Hu Shih, the principal of China Public School, once submitted his resignation last winter. However, due to a lack of a successor at the time, it was postponed until today when he formally submitted his resignation. After the board of directors approved it, Mr. Ma Junwu was invited to succeed him as the head of Zhonggong. Mr. Ma held an inauguration ceremony at the main hall of the school in Wusong on the 19th of this month. Chairman Cai Jiemin of the board of directors personally went to supervise the oath. The ceremony was held in accordance with etiquette. First, former Principal Hu delivered an opening speech, briefly stating that his resignation was not due to environmental pressure, as rumored by the outside world. If he was afraid of environmental pressure, he should have resolutely resigned last year and not waited until today. Mr. Ma was selected by us after a long period of searching. He is an old teacher of this school and a scientist with a great reputation in China. In the future, he will definitely bring unlimited glory to this school. Then, Mr. Cai delivered a speech, the general idea being that Mr. Hu and Mr. Ma have completely the same academic ability and moral integrity, and he cited various disciplines to prove this. Then, Mr. Ma Junwu delivered an inaugural speech, with many sincere appeals, hoping to share responsibility with the former principal and promote the glory of the school. Mr. Ma did not speak much because he was ill. Then, Gao Yihan delivered a speech, with four hopes: 1. To maintain the spirit of freedom of speech and express academic ideas. 2. To improve the material treatment of teachers so that they can teach with peace of mind. 3. To enrich the library to the minimum extent and become the most perfect library in Shanghai. 4. To increase the school's funding so that students can study for free in the future. Mr. Gao regarded these four hopes as what the school should do in order to reach the leading position of the highest institution of learning in the country. Finally, Yao Fangren, the representative of the student union, delivered a welcome speech, with three expectations for the new principal: (1) to quickly solve the school's registration problem; (2) to complete the new school building as soon as possible; (3) to continue and promote the spirit of former Principal Hu. After the ceremony, the Mathematics and Physics Department held a banquet for Mr. Ma, and the evening ended with joy.</p>

<p>Supports Recovering Educational Rights in the Concessions</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Special City Education Bureau proposed the recovery of educational rights in the concessions, the response from all parties has been very strong. Yesterday, the Wusong District Municipal School Teachers and Staff Federation also issued a declaration, solemnly stating the importance of this work.</p>

<p>In Accordance with Department Regulations, Changed to Teachers' Training Program</p>
<p>Daxia University added a Higher Normal Teachers' Training Program in the autumn of 1925, recruiting graduates from senior high schools and providing them with two years of higher normal education. The students who have graduated in the past have reached more than 200, and those who serve in educational administrative organs in various provinces and middle schools are well received. When the school was registered last year, the Ministry of Education recognized that the performance of the training program was excellent and allowed it to continue. However, it pointed out that the name "Higher Normal Department" was inconsistent with the newly promulgated academic system. The school affairs meeting decided that the name would be changed to Teachers' Training Program from the autumn to comply with the department regulations. As for the admission qualifications and length of study, they remain the same as before. The curriculum content after the autumn of this year has been planned by Dr. Huang Jingsi, director of the department, and has been greatly improved, making it more practical and applicable than before. The enrollment date will still be held at the same time as the various colleges of the school.</p>

<p>Clearly Separating Finances to Become an Independent Commercial Institution</p>
<p>Hoping for Development to Assist Villagers of Zhenru</p>
<p>National Jinan University originally had a school bank, but due to its limited scope and entanglement with school finances, its business was difficult to develop. President Zheng recognized this early on and deemed it necessary to establish an independent bank. Preparatory personnel were then hired to actively plan, and after half a year, all matters were in order. A formal opening ceremony was held yesterday, presided over by economic expert Yang Ru , who reported that the bank was separated from the school's finances and was purely an independent commercial institution. Business procedures are entirely in accordance with ordinary banks. Because it is located at Jinan University, it is named Grand South Bank. The purpose is to facilitate the savings, loans, and remittances of all teachers and students, and to provide practical opportunities for students in the School of Business. However, it is different from banks attached to ordinary business schools, because this bank also undertakes entrusted businesses. Subsequently, Manager Ye Yuan reported on the preparations, the current deposits, and the hope that future business development would achieve: 1. Direct remittances and trade with overseas countries; 2. Helping villagers in the rural areas of Zhenru with business and production. Then, guest Zhang Tianfang delivered a speech as a neighbor of the Zhenru New Village workers and Jinan University. Mr. Hong Zhiling said that Grand South Bank has two relationships: one with bookworms, and two with wasteful people, mixing seriousness with humor. Afterwards, Manager Ye hosted tea and snacks at the cooperative, and the meeting adjourned. It is reported that the bank will soon apply to the government for registration to solidify its foundation.</p>

<p>Guest: I heard that your house is famous for its antiques. Could you possibly allow me the pleasure of viewing them?</p>
<p>Servant: I'm very sorry. Our wife and young lady have both gone out. They two are the two most famous antiques.</p>
<p>Son: Father, I don't want to study arithmetic. It's been giving me headaches for the past few days.</p>
<p>Father: What are you talking about? When you grow up, if you don't know numbers, how will you be able to go to the gambling den and win people's money?</p>
<p>Villager: If you want to go to the village, you must follow this road.</p>
<p>Traveler: But don't you see the signpost by the side of the road? Doesn't it clearly indicate which road to take?</p>
<p>Villager: That is specially for tricking beggars, refugees, and bandits, so that they take the wrong road and don't get to the village.</p>
<p>A: Today I had something to say to you, but I'm very forgetful. I can't remember it for a moment.</p>

<p>Revolutionary martyr Mr. Chen Ying Shi has been dead for fourteen years. On the eighteenth of this month, the entire Lake Society held a groundbreaking ceremony for Martyr Chen at Shousheng Nunnery in front of Beijing Road. Many celebrities attended. Now, I will record the trivial details not mentioned in the newspapers to leave a fitting memorial.</p>
<p>A Commemorative Stool In the center of the ceremonial platform was a portrait of Sun Yat-sen. Below it was a photograph of Martyr Chen. In front was a rectangular stool. It is said that when Martyr Chen and his comrades attacked the Nanshi Arsenal that year, he was tied to this stool by Yuan Shikai's men and beaten with whips. However, the martyr felt that the physical pain was not important and did not diminish his revolutionary aspirations. Therefore, everyone still has a hundred percent respect for this commemorative stool.</p>
<p>Neatly Dressed Students The groundbreaking song that day was sung by students from middle and elementary schools in Huzhou who were living in Shanghai. The male students of the school wore gray uniforms, which were very solemn. The female students also wore dark blue cheongsams, which were very beautiful.</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang Personally Lays the Foundation That day, Mayor Zhang Qun personally laid the foundation. He held a hoe in both hands, moved the soil, and carefully placed the foundation stone. It was not until five minutes later that it was finished. Although Mayor Zhang was very strenuous at this time, he felt very comforted in his spirit.</p>

<p>On the fourteenth of this month, the Jinan, Jiaotong, Guanghua, and Fudan Four University Mandarin Speech Competition opened at the Zhiyuan Hall of Jinan University. More than a thousand students from various schools attended, making it a grand occasion. Now, I will record the snippets of it, which readers will probably be happy to hear.</p>
<p>The Layout of the Venue The form of the venue was very similar to that of the Peking Grand Theater. On the left side of the stage was the seat for the four timekeepers sent by the four schools. On the right side was the seat for the eight speakers. In front of the timekeeper's seat was a square table about ten feet long. At first glance, it was no different from a temporary court courtroom.</p>
<p>The Romance of China and the West A certain actor spoke about the word "life" and extended it to the romance of China and the West. He said that Westerners' lives are quite orderly. They go from the lively period of childhood to the love period of middle age, from the love period of middle age to the fame and fortune period of adulthood, and finally to the leisure and enjoyment period of old age. Chinese people are all messed up. The reason is that China lacks a love period. Because China only has one "bedroom love" after marriage. Apart from the bedroom, there is simply no love to talk about. Although it is said that it has progressed now, it is another kind of so-called "tool love." The so-called tool love means that if a certain lady likes literature, I will use literature to try to date her. If a certain lady likes to watch movies, I will invite her to watch movies. I always want to use a tool to get her favor. This actor spoke with humor, and the audience burst into laughter.</p>
<p>The Victory of the Northwest A certain actor wanted to cater to the trend, so he talked about the novel topic of "Going to the Northwest." As a result, he actually won the championship.</p>
<p>Cotton Was Favored There was also a very strange topic called "Cotton." He said that cotton has a great relationship with the politics and economy of Sinology and should be promoted. As a result, he also got second place. After the verdict, everyone said that the judges favored cotton.</p>
<p>The Beauty Trap Failed A certain university selected a female representative to participate last year and actually won the championship trophy. This year, they used the same trick again, but unfortunately it failed. (But rewarded)</p>
<h3 id="e121">Climbing the First Pavilion in Songjiang · Qing · Song · Ju · Shi <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Above the head gate of my Song County Office, there are several pavilions, square and tall, facing the thoroughfare in front, separated by a corridor in the middle, and facing the official residence in the back, which can be a place for the people of this county to visit. However, it has been in disrepair for many years and is about to collapse. Even if one wants to climb it, it is very dangerous, and it is often guarded by iron generals, so it is difficult to enter. Since County Magistrate Jin took office, all government affairs have been made public, and he wanted to repair it and use it as a place for officials and people to relax. At first, he had the ambition but did not achieve it. Last year, he collected money to build it beautifully and refurbished it, so that people could climb the steps, ascend, and indulge their ambitions. On the fifth day of the fifth month of this year, the sun was shining and the breeze was gentle, and I was flying with excitement. I walked slowly to the bottom of the pavilion. There are dozens of stone steps winding up, for tourists to go from the bottom to the top, directly to the pavilion. I climbed the steps to the middle floor, which is surrounded by stone railings on all sides, where one can look far and wide. In the center of the four walls, there are many stone inscriptions, which were inscribed by those who came to guard this county during the Ming and Qing dynasties. Unfortunately, I am forgetful and cannot remember them. I think they are just official articles, saying nice things. One more floor up, the windows are bright and the tables are clean, free from dust. Reading books and newspapers, the furnishings are elegant, no less than a public entertainment department for the people. This cannot but praise Mr. Jin for taking the people's hearts as his own and opening the door of convenience, and giving the people of Songjiang the joy of visiting. Turning forward again, the plaque stands tall, saying "The First Pavilion in Songjiang." The calligraphy is vigorous, thin, and hard, communicating with the gods. It is said that it was written by a famous Yuan person, but there is no need to delve into it. The name of this pavilion is named after its shape and can be seen at a glance. Leaning on the railing and looking into the distance, the scenery is clear at a glance. Like combs, the city's market streets. The two peaks facing each other are the Fangta and Xilin Pagodas inside and outside the city. The vermilion and black colors are dazzling and magnificent, the Provincial Girls' High School. The earth's horizon rises like steamed buns, the mounds in the suburbs. Winding like a rainbow and towering to the left and right are the battlements of the surrounding city walls. All shapes and colors are all visible in front of the pavilion. I regret not bringing a quick lens to capture this image. Otherwise, it would be a wonderful picture.</p>

<p>The rose is a flower that has always been famous and precious. Throughout history, those who have seen and recited it, such as Minister Chen's poem, call it "the most romantic rose in the world." It can be said to be the highest praise. Others, such as Fan Da and the Su Shi brothers, have also written articles. Examining its names, it has titles such as "Evergreen" and "Slender Guest," as seen in Qunfang Pu. In Huajing's five grades and five lives, the rose is the flower envoy. Unfortunately, good species have been rarely seen recently, so there is nothing to do but feel regret. Yesterday, I went to Little Guanyuan in Hejiuzhai, Zhabei, with the auspicious man Foqing. I saw more than two hundred kinds of roses. Each kind has been given a good name by Shanghai scholars. One kind is green. When it blooms, each branch has two pistils side by side, which Fan Duanyuan titled "Double Emerald Birds." One kind is purple, with white stripes in the middle, which Chen Xiaodie titled "Purple Carpet Snow." One kind is pure white, which Chen Gangshu titled "Ice Wheel at the Bottom of the Water." One kind is pink, which Li Haoran titled "Jade Beauty's Spring Thoughts." One kind is vermilion, with white dots on the petals, which Sun Yusheng titled "Rouge with Snow Dots." One kind is pure crimson, like velvet floating up, which Yan Duhe titled "Crimson Clouds in the Sky." The above kinds, once they are named by celebrities, complement each other. There is also a kind that is golden yellow. The flowers are extremely beautiful and rare in the world. Zhou Shoujuan titled it "Yellow Silk Young Woman." I asked Foqing to take a picture of it and publish it above, so that those who love this flower can see it with their own eyes.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Supplement to the Pygmy People · Qing · Yao <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, I read an article by Junshuo in this column, "Doubts about the Record of Viewing the Pygmy People," and cited Zeng Jize's diary when he was an envoy to Europe as evidence, and doubted its fabrication and forced physical resemblance. I have seen a book called "Thousands of Wonders," I do not know where it was published in Shanghai. It is probably similar to the Guangfangyan Hall of the Manufacturing Bureau, but I cannot be sure. I have only seen one volume of the second volume, and I cannot get a glimpse of the whole picture. It also contains a short story about short people, which can be used by readers to smile. Therefore, I have specially recorded it and answered Junshuo.</p>
<p>The human body is like a pygmy, which is a disease. There is no such thing as a dwarf country in the world. Westerners have often gathered short people from various countries and written them down in books for reference. There was an Englishman named Hudson, who was born in the second year of Chongzhen in the Ming Dynasty and died in the thirty-second year of Kangxi. He was thirty years old and only one foot and three inches tall. In the sixth year of Qianlong, there was a short man in France named Xiaoer. He weighed only one catty when he was born and only ten catties when he was six years old. When he was fifteen years old, he was more than two feet tall and died at the age of twenty-three. There was a short man in the Netherlands, born in the fourth year of Guangxu. There were nine brothers and sisters, who were no different from ordinary people. Only the youngest daughter was only seven inches tall when she was in swaddling clothes. When she was five years old, she was one foot and two inches tall and weighed more than two catties. When she was seven years old, she was one foot and five inches tall and weighed seven catties. Putting her on the table, her father was next to her, and the two were compared, like Mount Tai to a hillock. (There is a picture in this book) However, this girl is exceptionally intelligent. In addition to speaking her native language, she is also fluent in English, French, and German. She traveled to various countries, and viewers often threw money at her, which led to great wealth. However, her body was weak and could hardly bear the weight of her clothes. Her spine was like a human, but her feet were weak. A certain doctor in Paris examined her pulse and found that it was as weak as Yan Shou. She only slept eight or nine hours a day and often showed joy, without any worries. If someone gave her something, she would accept it and thank them respectfully. Also, the French Learned Newspaper contained the name of a Russian, who was nineteen years old and weighed only five French pounds and was one foot and six inches tall.</p>
<p>In addition, most of what is recorded is based on science. Unlike Zixu's disregard for short people, who did not investigate the reason for their existence. It comes from nature and is not related to grinding or twisting. Then there is something credible. In ancient times, our country had a dwarf clan, which was three feet tall, but Wei Zhao said, "A different name for the southwestern barbarians." His statement is also not accurate. I wonder how heaven created them at the beginning.</p>
<h3 id="e124">On the Spring Sports Meeting of Minli Middle School · Yan · Jin <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>In this time of late spring and early summer, when the weather is clear, schools everywhere are holding sports meetings to promote physical education and wipe away the shame of being the "sick men of East Asia." Yan Jin has repeatedly visited and feels that sports talents have become more popular in recent years. He is truly happy about it. The other day (the sixteenth), the wind was gentle and the sun was warm, and there was no dust or sand. It was the date of the spring sports meeting of his alma mater, Minli Middle School. He invited more than ten friends, including Guo Qimeng, Zhang Keqin, Jin Jisheng, and Shimizu Sanlang, to visit together. He felt infinite emotion. The school has 1,500 students, and more than 488 of them participated in the sports meeting, accounting for almost one-third of the entire school. By this analogy, there should be one million athletes among the three million students in our country. Isn't that great? It is a pity that other schools are not as universal in sports as my alma mater. I will not discuss the merits of their achievements for the time being. The school authorities have worked hard to promote it and make it popular, and their intentions are very good. I will record this to inform other schools.</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor To Mr. Zhuzhu, Reading the manuscript of He Tianjian's "Tinglin Plundering Woman" on the fourteenth, I think it is a misunderstanding of hearsay. The so-called woman surnamed XX is the wife of Xia of Lixiang. She took her children with her and took advantage of the tomb sweeping to return to her mother's house in Ning. Unexpectedly, when the ship arrived at Zhangjing, she was plundered by Zhang Zhaohua's men, who were bandits from Haizhou, and extorted a large sum of money. Fortunately, she was rescued by the anti-bandit army in a boat in Yangcheng River, Jiangsu. Now the family has been reunited. The woman is already middle-aged and has many children. Not only is she a middle-aged woman, but she has no charm to speak of. The bandits also had no intention of comparing Sha Chili to Zhangtai Willow. Only the huge sum of money was difficult to raise for a while, so the time was slightly delayed. I am a close relative of the Xia family, and I know the truth of the matter in the inside. I have respectfully presented it to Mr. Chen, hoping that it will be published in the "Letter to the Editor" column, so that it can be corrected. I am eagerly looking forward to it. With best wishes, Your sincere, Gu Puren of Tinglin.</p>

<p>LesSoixanteansdeHenriMatisse</p>
<p>It was the day after Matisse's sixtieth birthday that the Matisse masterpiece exhibition was held at the Paul Rosenberg Gallery at 99 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré in Paris. The masterpieces of this master of "the enjoyment of life" are on display. Among them, the recent works of this genius are mixed with his early works. There are sketches and oil paintings, about sixty in total. It is really a noble and rare opportunity. After visiting several times in a row, I realized a new flavor in the paintings of this genius. I felt that this time I was close to the real feeling of Matisse's paintings. Because seeing a few of his works occasionally in museums or galleries on weekdays cannot show his flavor. To study a writer, one must look at him from all aspects and periods. Not only for Matisse, but for all masters. Before, when I was in Japan, I had seen various Matisse picture albums or colored reproductions. Naturally, I had a slight understanding of Matisse's outline. Although I admired him a hundred and twenty percent, I still couldn't feel how profound the real flavor was. Today, it is the sixtieth birthday of this first genius of Europe. I have directly tasted most of his masterpieces in detail. This is really the first happy event in my life. At the same time, what I personally felt is as follows. The expression of artistic works is the development of mankind. The expression of "the struggle for life" is a biological phenomenon that arises from the necessity of the inner spirit. I feel that the characteristic of modern creators is to affirm the personality of each person through the transmission of works. Therefore, psychology has seized the position of "conceptualism," emphasizing the emotions awakened in the individual's heart. Such paintings, no matter what method they use, are ten thousand times higher than paintings with religious or story themes or paintings that imitate the external appearance of nature. It transcends the immediacy and randomness and is based on the permanent absoluteness, that is, human emotions. I do not recognize the ridiculous and narrow principle that a painting has its own special world, its own special rules, and its own purpose. Art is just a moment in the life of the universe. I now trust my previous proposition to oppose "laws." If you penetrate the work of art with intuition and savor it with emotion, what I mean by "absolute eternity" is not the way, kind, or number of the world we represent, but the release of emotions. Regarding these words, I am not afraid of anyone's criticism or even abuse that I am resisting some kind of idealism or some kind of formalism. I always feel that I have to say this.</p>

<h3 id="e126">The Discount Market is About to Become Dull as Summer Approaches <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Copper Coins Rise Steadily… The Overall Market is at 415,000 Cash</p>
<p>Market Overview Although yesterday was Monday, which is usually the busiest day, the trading situation and acceptance status were not very prosperous. It can be seen that as summer approaches, demand in all aspects is becoming dull. All kinds of market prices have also generally declined due to the weak situation, but silver discounts are still stable.</p>
<p>Discount Prices The early market price for "foreign cents" was 7 yuan, 1 fen, 9 li, 7 hao, and 5 si. The afternoon market fell to 7 yuan, 1 fen, 9 li, 1 hao, and 2 hu, resulting in a decrease of 0.75 hao compared to the previous day.

<p>528.5 Taels</p>
<p>Import of Silver Requires Passports Yesterday, the gold price rose again. The market's volatility made it hard to predict. The fluctuation between opening and closing amounted to 7 taels. The general trend was upward. Foreign exchange markets were tight in both official and unofficial trades. Banks had strong confidence. The discount rate decreased in two consecutive steps by one-and-a-half gears. Investors, however, were confused and bought and sold inconsistently. Taixing, Yuanxingyong, and Yiyu, among others, bought, while Hengxing, Yuansheng, Wanxing, and Shunli, among others, sold. The market opened high due to the reduction of credit on the weekend. As aggressive buyers emerged and foreign exchange became hard to buy, the price temporarily surged to a new high of 528.5 taels. Heavy selling caused the price to drop by 4-5 taels. Still, the price fluctuated by 2-3 taels at a time. In the later session, Wanxing and Yuanxingyong, among others, as well as retail investors, bought. The price decreased as sellers rose, like Zhifengyong, Yongchengchang, and Chunyuanyong. At first, the market price was steady. With the National Government issuing orders for silver imports that require a passport, public sentiment became bleak. Traders sold enthusiastically, breaking 520 taels. Foreign exchange markets also weakened.</p>
<p>Opening High, Adding About Five Taels Since yesterday was Monday, there was no trade for big bills. The opening price for the July contract was 522 taels, an increase of 4.9 taels. Spot markets fluctuated between 4-5 taels, jumping from 21 taels to 26 taels. Remittance prices also increased. Some banks sold 10 pence for British gold and British silver for June, then bought back 9.9375 pence. Japanese silver was bought for 1.11 taels. Although the discount rate was originally lowered to 0.25 for USD and 0.5 for JPY, the gold price remained steady at 25 taels. Mitsui then sold 0.125 pence of forward contracts. When the number of buyers increased and it became hard to buy remittances, the banks wanted to increase their holdings. At 9:50, the market price rose to a new price of 28.5 taels. As sellers surged, the price lowered by 2 taels in a short amount of time. When the banks lowered the discount rate by 0.125 for USD and 0.25 for JPY and raised the rate for JPY by 0.005, the price was 7.6 taels after 10 o'clock. The price fluctuated between 2 taels before the price took a hit as sellers, like Hengxing, offered. The price closed at 24.1 taels at noon.</p>
<p>The Closing Price Slightly Recovered to 19.8 Taels The afternoon market opened at 25.6 taels and increased to 27 taels. Later, as remittance prices fell, the price decreased 5 taels. At 3 o'clock, the price was 22 taels. A moment later, as retail investors bought, the price rose to 1.67 taels. After 3:30, news came that importers needed passports to import silver, which caused fear among traders. When the market went into a selling frenzy, the price sharply fell by 4 taels. The price fell to 19.3 taels at 4 o'clock. Eventually, the market price recovered to 20.045 taels and settled at 19.89 taels. The closing price was 19.8 taels at 4:30, which was 2.7 taels higher than the previous day (Saturday).</p>
<p>Closing Prices: The Spread was 11-12 Taels The price difference from peak to trough was 9.2 taels, as the highest market price was 28.5 taels and the lowest price was 19.3 taels. The quotation was lowered by 13-14 taels. The rate for JPY increased by 0.005, bringing it to 541.8 taels. This lowered the price by 18 taels. The bid was lowered to 21 taels for the afternoon. The registered rate was 24 taels, and the price after adjusting for water was 26 taels. Afternoon: 22 taels. Physical: The early market opened at 21.5 taels, closed at 25 taels at noon, and settled at 19.4 taels in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Foreign Exchange Markets Repeatedly Contracted</p>
<h3 id="e128">Internal Trading Becoming Tight...Fluctuations Also Becoming Larger <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Merchants Buying Eagerly...Banks Reluctant to Sell</p>
<p>As usual, at the beginning of last week, there were no telegraphic transfers in the silver markets of England, America, and India. The exchange rates posted by HSBC kept shrinking by one and a half notches, reaching new records. Calculating, British gold increased by 0.02375, U.S. dollars by 0.0075, and Japanese exchange by 0.02. From the initial shrinking at 9:30 AM by 0.0225, U.S. dollars by 0.5 yuan, Indian rupees by 1.25 yuan, French francs by 13 yuan, Japanese currency by 1.25 yuan, French exchange by 2.5 yuan, Singapore exchange added 0.125 taels, Japanese gold added 0.015, and Hong Kong added 0.025.

Hong Kong remained unchanged at 8 taels. The internal trend also tightened, but due to significant fluctuations in bid prices, there were also ups and downs. The market situation was chaotic and unpredictable, causing people to feel uncertain. However, the result was still a trend towards appreciation compared to last Saturday, with shillings shrinking by 0.0125, U.S. dollars by 0.0025, and Japanese gold rising by 0.0025. Chinese merchants and speculators were eager to buy, but banks were quite firm and unwilling to sell easily. Shengda and others bought 200,000 pounds of British gold, sold by HSBC, McCallum, Mitsui, and Sumitomo, etc. However, Mitsui slightly absorbed some. Moreover, attempts to buy U.S. dollars were unsuccessful; only Anda, Huabi, Meifeng, and Xingye traded over 100,000 yuan among themselves. As for Japanese gold, both supply and demand were present, totaling about 100,000 yuan. Datong and Zhejiang Industrial sold, while Mitsui, Chosen, and Sumitomo made some purchases. The market atmosphere remained relatively stable throughout, contrasting with the gold market.</p>

The buying and selling in both the front and after-markets were very active, a situation rarely seen recently. The total turnover in both markets reached over 12.1 million yuan, but the spot transactions were still scattered. Although the buyers were making strong bids, and the market prices were already very high, the selling pressure was also very strong, resulting in no significant fluctuations. The prices of various bonds changed slightly, with only a slight increase in the end. For example, Customs Duty bonds rose by about 0.008 yuan, and the Continuing Sixth Year Bonds also rose by 0.004-0.005 yuan, while others also increased by about 0.002 yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market remains sluggish, with no differentiation between gains and losses. Both the front and after-markets showed no fluctuations. The sluggishness of the market is rarely seen in history. In reality, both the bullish and bearish sides are exerting significant pressure, causing the market to stagnate. Outsiders, aware of this deadlock, are also refraining from taking action, and new transactions are extremely scarce. However, the overall environment is poor, the prices of Three Goods Yarn are weak, the political situation is chaotic, and sales are difficult to boost. Currently, the buyers are holding tight, which is temporarily able to maintain the situation. There were no major fluctuations in the human index. The opening price of the futures yarn front-market rose slightly by 0.001-0.002 yuan. Then, in the second or third trading session, news came that Three Goods Yarn had fallen again, and market sentiment weakened, falling by 0.002-0.003 yuan. As a result, it closed down by 0.001 yuan, while the following month remained flat. Trading in the market remained scarce, and the afternoon remained flat, with nothing exciting to report. It was observed that the bullish side sold off 500-600 bales, and the bearish side also bought in 500-600 bales. The prices of each month fell by 0.001 yuan. The total daily transaction was statistically at 6,800 bales. The closing price of the human index is recorded below: Human Index Closing Price Rise/Fall Stored Account Number August 152.8 Down 126,800</p>

<p>Spot sales are not good. Spot yarn sales are mediocre, with various guilds buying 1,040 bales, and fellow traders buying 250 bales. The market price fell by 0.0025 yuan. Among the customer guilds, Tianjin bought the most, totaling 305 bales. In addition, Shantou bought 150 bales, Qinhuangdao bought 55 bales, inland areas bought 70 bales, Qingdao bought 220 bales, Andong bought 20 bales, Sichuan bought 60 bales, Guangdong bought 85 bales, and miscellaneous guilds bought 75 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Near-Term Cotton Down, Distant-Term Flat <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is quiet, but the near-term is weak because the Japanese merchant Dongmian has unloaded 10,000+ piculs, and there is a lack of buyers. The retailers are panicked and the market is more tired. However, distant months buyers are still buying and not releasing. Therefore, market conditions are more expensive. On the market, spot cotton sales stagnate, and all factories have no need. The shape of American cotton is still flat. How will the future go? It is still up to American and Indian cotton to advance and retreat.</p>
<p>Near-Term Cotton Breaks Below the 5 Tael Mark. At the opening of the front-market, the price of Gold Standard cotton was high, and the market atmosphere for the distant months was stronger. Near-term dropped by 0.05 yuan, distant rose by 0.01 yuan. The afternoon closed flat, and some were short covering. Distant months continued to rise by 0.005 yuan. The total daily transaction was 19,000 piculs. The closing price of Gold Standard cotton is recorded below.</p>

<p>Actual sales are difficult to develop. Spot cotton remains calm, and the appetite of each factory is quite sluggish. The source is estimated to be 300 bales of Tong cotton and 310 bales of Yao cotton. The sales record is on the left.</p>

<p>Liverpool's spot demand was quiet last week. Futures rose and fell with the US cotton weather report. The US Department of Agriculture did not want cotton prices to fall small and said that there would be no more catastrophic falls in the future. At the same time, business pessimism also made it impossible to rise. As a result, market conditions were uncertain. Egyptian cotton business was light and prices shifted with news from American cotton and Alexandria.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Silk and Tea, Haining Cocoon Prices Step Higher <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>In the various cities and townships of Haining County, this year's new cocoon harvest is not as abundant as that of Hangzhou County, but the quality of the cocoons is quite good. This is because the weather this year has been abnormal, and farmers who raise improved varieties account for 70% of the total. Native breeds mostly disappeared during the major sleep stage. The impact of improved breeds is still slight, so the cocoon bodies are better. The cocoon market has been open for eight or nine days, and the initial cocoon price was only 55.6-60 yuan. This is because farmers, in view of the excellent quality of the new cocoons, insisted on selling at high prices. Otherwise, they would take them back to reel silk. Therefore, the cocoon merchants had no choice but to raise cocoon prices and compete to collect them. Cocoon prices rose step by step, with Chang'an seeing the highest increase. The improved variety cocoons opened at 80 yuan yesterday morning, while Haining and other places were only at 75-6 yuan. Each merchant has been collecting more goods in recent days, and large batches of dry cocoons are being transported to Shanghai in batches.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Dry Cocoons Waiting for Transport at Chang'an Station <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>New cocoons from Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Haining, and other places have all been put on the market. The cocoon merchants have been open for more than a week, and each merchant's collection volume is higher than last year's. They are baking them day and night in order to transport them to Shanghai in batches. According to investigations, since the new cocoons from Zhejiang and Hangzhou have been put on the market, only 500-600 bales of dry cocoons have been transported to Shanghai. Currently, cocoon bales are piled up like mountains in the Chang'an Station area. The Railway Bureau is in urgent need of transport due to a lack of locomotives. The Huitong Company, which is contracted to load cocoon bales, has now sent a letter to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureau, requesting them to find a way to allocate more freight cars for loading and transport.</p>
<h3 id="e137">New Atmosphere in the Yushan Tea Market <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Plain Tea Picking and Manufacturing Completed...New Tea Opening Price 30 Yuan</p>
<p>High Village Tea Not Yet Open...Tea Firms Opening 30</p>
<p>Yushan in Guangxin Prefecture is an important tea-producing area in Jiangxi Province. There are many local merchants operating foreign tea estates. In the most prosperous years, there were 50-60 tea firms in the entire county. In recent years, due to the influence of banditry, foreign sales have not been smooth, and the number of tea firms has decreased day by day. Last year, there was almost no tea market to speak of. This year, Yushan County's tea production is very abundant. The plain tea in various mountain households was completed a month ago. High village tea developed later, with only tender buds showing, and has not yet reached harvesting. Recently, because the Communist bandits have been besieged by the garrison, they have fled to Dexing and Leping. Tea firms are taking the opportunity to rise up. There are more than a dozen tea firms in Zhangcun Street, the concentration of the tea market. There are more than 20 tea firms in Tongjiafang, Zhengjiafang, Miaodi, Yingpanshan, and Xiaoyushan in the Wubang area. Plain low village tea has been opened by local and foreign guilds, with prices ranging from 22 yuan to 34-5 yuan. Each picul of tea is subject to an additional 2 yuan bandit suppression fee. Transactions are very active. As of today, the amount handled by each firm and foreign guilds has reached a huge 10,000 piculs. Mountain households are now relieved and have proposed a high price. Each firm's first batch of new tea will be successively opened on the 5th and 6th of this month, rushing to make Zhenmei to transport to Shanghai. The market has suddenly presented a new atmosphere.</p>

More than 4,000 boxes of new samples of black tea from Qimen, Fuliang, Jiande, Ningzhou, and other routes were displayed in various tea warehouses. British firms such as Jardine Matheson and Jinlong paid special attention to the high village Qimen tea. As a result of city-wide negotiations, Qimen tea opened at 125-190 taels, 40-50 taels higher than last year, an unprecedented high price. It is heard that there is still a price of more than 200 taels being negotiated. However, dealers showed little interest in middle and low village tea. Black tea seems to have a trend of raising high and suppressing low.</p>
<h3 id="e139">The Food River Down Rice Market Becoming More Quiet <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, fewer than ten boats came from the inland to Zhabei. Local sales remained sluggish. The white japonica market became more quiet. The high-quality goods were sold by customers, while ordinary medium-quality goods had to be cleverly handled. Few people were interested in the new japonica rice from the previous season. Therefore, prices gradually fluctuated slightly to the left and right. Transactions were deserted and the situation was sluggish. Thin rice entering the market still lacked appetite. All the long-standing and half-cut boats feared deterioration due to the hot weather and had to sell at a discount. Fortunately, this type of goods was extremely rare, and it failed to affect the high-quality goods. Yangdu Xian rice arriving was still not popular, and it was said that the river would soon be exhausted, so there was no standard for market prices. Large plates all reported stability, and variable yuan transactions weakened. Customer sales were sluggish, and shade yuan was scarce. Each yuan had no increase or decrease for the time being.</p>
<p>Few sources arrived in the Southern Shanghai River. In this street market, the digestion of white japonica rice from Xixi, Suzhou, and Tongxiang was only slightly moving in retail. The market situation yesterday had no rise or fall. Currently, due to the exhaustion of both storage and arrivals, it will remain stagnant for the time being. The special top-quality japonica rice is still opened at 20 yuan, closed on the left. The thin early rice from Southern Gang, Sijing, and Chonggu slightly softened in the market, but buyers intended to trim down, and sellers intended to shout up, so there was a mutual interference trend at the beginning of the morning. Then, due to slightly connected entries and exits, the large plate continued to flatten. The Yangdu and each sharp rice followed the trend of foreign rice, with all parties watching due to the scarcity of goods. The market transaction was extremely dull. Both white yuan arrivals and sales were scarce, and the market once again reported flat fatigue.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Futures Flour's Fearsome Surge <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Bulls Continue to Push High...Surge by Two Fen</p>
<p>Producers Dump Distant-Term...Follow the Rise Separately</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market once again showed a surge. The total daily transaction also reached about 700,000, with the bulls' chips exceeding all the existing flour owned by the producers. Therefore, they were squeezing the shorts at will. The five-and-a-half qian mark was no longer feared. It has already been reached, and the intention to raise it has not weakened. Therefore, in the morning, it was only slightly more than 0.05 yuan. By the afternoon, due to the short covering and more competition, the market surged again, with the highest price reaching 2.57 taels. However, it is speculated that the bullish speculation will not end until it has been raised to 2.6 taels. For distant-term months, because inland gangs were aware of the producer's dumping, this month has gradually risen extraordinarily, and the buying interest has been exceptionally strong. Among the gangs, the Xixi Gang was the most enthusiastic. Observing the subsequent steps, there is still a continued rise trend. As a result, May and June rose by 0.02 yuan compared to the previous day, July rose by 0.015 yuan, August and September each rose by 0.01 yuan, and October rose by 0.0075 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Futures Wheat Traded 200 Carloads <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Although yesterday's wheat surge was not huge, the transaction volume for each month also reached about 200 carloads. With the current bullish and bearish forces, the strength is great. The bulls believe that the flour market is good, and the buying interest is naturally brave and unspeakable. The sellers believe that the weather is very good, and the harvest of new wheat in each producing area is expected to be better than in previous years. Therefore, they are also doing their best to sell. However, the current position of the bulls seems to be superior. Therefore, in the midst of the volatility of each month, it ultimately appeared good. As a result, June, July, August, and September each improved by 0.01 yuan compared to the previous week, and October improved by 0.03 yuan. Spot wheat is firm in standard steps, and the factory's appetite has not eased. However, the quoted price for high-car wheat has risen by another 0.02-0.03 yuan. The medium-quality has also brought up a lot. Kaixuzhou Nansuzhou Qingjiangpu Wheat is 5.15 taels, Hankou Wheat is 4.62 taels, for a total of 2,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Piece Goods, Yuan Foreign Yarn Sales Are Very Smooth <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of fine cloth from this factory rose again. Gangs from Ningbo, Tianjin, Niuzhuang, etc., were again actively searching for spot goods. Blue Flying Fish has risen to 7.2 taels, Trumpet Boy 6.875 taels, Blue Chicken, with consistent purchases from Ningbo Gang and this street, has risen even higher, from 6.475 taels to 6.6 taels. However, coarse cloth remains tired. 18-pound Tianzi fell again by 0.05 yuan and sold for 7.65 taels. Only 13-pound Flying Bear had 150 pieces transacted by Ningbo Gang, with a price of 5.6 taels. Blue Double Fish fine twill, the Shantou Gang went to 50 pieces yesterday at a price of 6.45 taels. Blue Strip Bleached Cloth is increasingly falling, and Dafeng Qiahe goods are consistently opened at 7.1 taels.</p>
<p>The general trend of East and West piece goods is stable. Among the goods, East goods Yuan Foreign Yarn is the most popular. The Diantao Xiang goods have not yet arrived in Shanghai and were already sold out in advance yesterday, with most opening at 8.5 taels, Tianyuanbao 8.25 taels, Foreign Beauty 8.225 taels, Zijinshan 8.05 taels. Sales are smooth because the number arriving this year is not large and the sales season is approaching. The trend is uniquely strong. Printed cloth is in a somewhat declining state. The sales market has been almost completely invaded by Shanghai printed and dyed goods, so they have fallen into the 4 tael mark. Western goods Blue Strip Ramie Yarn, the inland Gang bought yesterday, Haohua One Deer Head 1.95 taels, Tianfu Fenghongyi 2 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Hardware Guild Company Iron Goods Scarce and Prices Rise <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>200-pound Guild Company Iron, current transactions are less because the tobacco company has bad news, and the export gang is also buying little due to the unstable situation. The market image is deserted. However, purchases from printing factories and canning factories have risen sharply. Yesterday, 600-700 boxes were transacted in the market, and prices rose by several qian due to the scarcity of goods. Moreover, the foreign exchange rate is weak again, so its price is standing out. For example, Mitsui goods opened at 18.5 taels, American Kang goods 19.3 taels, Fengyu goods 19.5 taels, Hanli goods 19 taels, miscellaneous brand goods 18.35 taels. It is heard that among the openings, Mitsui, American Kang, and Fengyu goods are the most popular.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's telegraphic news reported that the current price of Cuban raw sugar was 1.50, up 0.3125. New York's futures sugar for May was 1.4, up 0.01, September was 1.58, down 0.01, December was 1.67, and next year's March was 1.76, all unchanged. The current price of Javanese sugar remained at 9.625, and June and July were both at 9.50, each rising by 0.0125. The association's raw sand white market was quite strong, with higher prices for deliveries, and buyers were also quite active, because it was very different compared to Japanese sugar. Therefore, the buying interest was very strong, and the market price suddenly turned and stepped up. The initial transaction price was 7.025 taels, and in an instant, it rose to 7.05 taels, and the transaction was still frequent. Later, it reached 7.075 taels, and high-quality TO Mark was 7.1 taels. Deliveries were still scarce, and the market was very strong, but the buying interest turned to be scarce, and the market was flat. 20th medium sand was 6.95 taels, and high-quality 7 taels was also popular. Japanese sugar YP Mark was 7.725 taels, YRO Mark was 7.25 taels, YT Mark was 7.5375 taels, and J Da 7.15 taels, with a fairly popular market image. N Mark was 7.6 taels, and ET Mark was the same price, but both were less well-received.</p>

<p>Abolishing Harsh and Trivial Taxes</p>
<p>Provincial Government's Reply to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Association</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government replied to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Association yesterday, stating: "In response to your letter, we have received your request from the Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce and Industry Association to reduce harsh and trivial taxes, and have instructed the department to verify and respond accordingly. The abolition of harsh and trivial taxes is enshrined in the party program and has been resolved and strictly implemented by former Director Zhang, and orders have been issued for compliance. Since taking office, the Director has handled all financial and administrative matters in accordance with the orders of the government. Recently, various counties have requested the collection of various donations for handling local undertakings. After careful consideration, weighing the urgency and importance, reductions and rejections have been made separately, and proposals have been submitted for deliberation, with the aim of benefiting the public without harming the people. For example, in Yangzhou, Dongtai, and other counties, the original donations for ships and cotton have been abolished separately, either because they conflict with the case or because they involve troublesome matters. In addition, any trivial new taxes that affect the livelihoods of the poor will be strictly rejected at any time to alleviate the people's difficulties. Therefore, we hereby submit this document in response."</p>

<p>To Negotiate a New Sino-Turkish Treaty</p>
<p>Mr. Futay Bey, the Turkish Chargé d'Affaires, left for Beijing last night with Mr. Hu Shize, Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to attend the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate a new Sino-Turkish Treaty of Commerce and Friendship.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The Truth About the Signing Process</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement has been approved and implemented by the National Government. A dispute arose before its implementation, and outsiders are unaware of the true situation regarding this rapid change. Therefore, our agency's reporter specially inquired about the details of the process from Mr. So-and-so, an important figure in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs close to Minister Wang. The following is a record of the conversation to clarify the truth. The following is the reporter's questions and Mr. So-and-so's answers:</p>
<p>(Question) What exactly was the situation regarding the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' inadequate procedures in signing the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement this time?</p>
<p>(Answer) Minister Wang is an experienced diplomat and has always been extremely cautious. He has already signed new treaties with sixteen or seventeen countries in the past two years. He certainly knows the procedures. The reason for the controversy this time is simply because the agreement was announced too quickly. The agreement was signed at noon on the 6th of this month, and it was reported in the newspapers on the 7th. The official documents from the Ministry to the Executive Yuan had not yet arrived, but outsiders had already read it in full. As a result, members of the Legislative Yuan, after seeing the report, immediately raised concerns that the diplomatic authorities had exceeded their authority regarding the effectiveness of Article 5. Minister Wang went to Shanghai on official business after signing, and the Legislative Yuan held a meeting on the 10th, so he could not immediately explain the situation, which led to further doubts due to repeated rumors. In fact, Article 5 is one of the articles in the entire agreement, and all articles must be submitted to the National Government for approval before they can take effect. If the National Government does not approve it, then the effectiveness of the 10th is like the skin without the fur, where can the fur attach? In short, if the agreement had been announced after approval by the National Government, there would have been no misunderstanding this time.</p>
<p>(Question) Before the official signing, was the content of the agreement submitted to the government and the Yuan for discussion?</p>
<p>(Answer) The full text of the agreement and its attachments were approved by the Foreign Affairs Group of the Central Political Conference before signing. At the meeting on the morning of March 19, the Foreign Affairs Group members, such as the three Yuan Presidents Tan, Hu, and Wang, and the four Ministers Sun, Kong, Song, and Wang, were all present. At that time, Committee Member Wang, in his capacity as Minister, presented the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement and its attachments, which he had drafted with Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu. After the members reviewed them, they considered them suitable for signing. President Wang Liangchou even personally wrote the words "Attachment One," "Attachment Two," and "Attachment Three" on the drafted agreement in pencil to indicate that the fourth attachment would not need to be included in the commercial treaty in the future. Minister Wang immediately stated that he would comply. This is an undeniable fact. However, as usual, the main articles of the treaty are the most important. The readers discussed the articles in Articles One, Two, and Three in detail, and only glanced at Articles Four and Five.</p>
<p>(Question) It is said that the provision on the effectiveness of Article 5 of the agreement was proposed by Minister Wang. What is its purpose?</p>
<p>(Answer) It was indeed Minister Wang's intention. Because Japanese diplomacy is very cunning, he feared that the signing would be delayed again and would not be implemented for a long time. Now, by setting a deadline for effectiveness, he hoped to quickly recover the Dalian and Andong Customs and implement the new tax rates, which could increase revenue by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan per month. Recently, with the soaring price of gold, international exchange rates have caused huge losses in the blink of an eye. The government wants the customs to be able to change the gold unit exchange rate according to the market price at any time to implement the autonomy of the exchange rate and recover the losses. Moreover, the new treaty on tariff autonomy has already been signed with various countries. Now, only Japan is obstructing it, giving other countries an excuse. This is a major obstacle to the promotion of tariff sovereignty. Therefore, he earnestly hopes that the Sino-Japanese Agreement will be implemented as soon as possible so that China's tariff autonomy can be promoted as a whole as soon as possible. He also believes that the government and the Yuan have long understood this intention and will definitely approve it without doubt.</p>
<p>(Question) Is China actually at a disadvantage in the provision for reciprocity?</p>
<p>(Answer) This time it is not reciprocity. According to the reciprocity method, both sides should reduce one-third or one-quarter of the current tax rates. However, according to Attachment One, not only will Japanese goods imported into China not be reduced, but some types can be increased by another 2.5%. However, it is stated that they will not be increased again within one or three years. As for cotton yarn, our country can levy a special tax again. Furthermore, regarding our country's goods exported to Japan, Japan also stated that the current tax rates will not be increased within one or three years, and the tax on silk and other items will be reduced by one-third. Therefore, on the surface, it seems that our country has the advantage and Japan is at a disadvantage. But in reality, it is not the case. Everyone knows that China's industry and commerce are not as good as Japan's. Most of our products are raw materials, and Japan does not levy taxes on them. It is impossible to make the types or values of goods reach a level playing field, just like placing a fat person and a thin person on opposite ends of a scale and trying to achieve a level balance. However, our side still achieves a level balance in the impossible, which is why our side levies a special tax on cotton yarn and adds another 2.5% to other types, while Japan reduces the tax on silk by one-third and does not add to other types. China can never permanently avoid signing a treaty with Japan, nor can it forcibly levy high tariffs on Japanese imports by force or order. Therefore, in order to gain diplomatic convenience and promote the entire tariff sovereignty, China can only make slight concessions. This is a matter of fact. For example, in a race, you can only strive forward; there is no reason to make people go backward, and this is the spirit of seeking mutual equality.</p>
<p>(Question) How about the provision in the attachment that 5 million yuan will be allocated annually for the purpose of reorganizing foreign debts?</p>
<p>(Answer) This provision was made by our country on its own initiative. In January of the 18th year of the Republic of China, the National Government instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inform all relevant countries that our country would allocate 5 million yuan annually from customs duties to reorganize domestic and foreign debts, starting from that year. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified nine countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy. This time, it is the same statement to Japan. It is also listed as a suspected use in the financial report of Minister Song at the Third National Congress. However, all of this naturally refers to legitimate domestic and foreign debts. In the future, when reorganizing with Japanese creditors, the scope should still be limited to legitimate debts.</p>
<p>(Question) Regarding the Legislative Yuan's review opinion, requesting a reprimand of the responsible authorities, it seems to blame the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>(Answer) Minister Wang never cares about the rights and wrongs of things at any particular time. As for reprimanding the responsible authorities, it is to pay attention to the organizational law of the National Government when concluding foreign treaties in the future. This is to warn against future problems and prevent them before they happen. Not only should the National Government issue this reprimand, but it is also what Minister Wang wants to request the National Government to issue a circular to reprimand.</p>

Because the Central Government ordered Minister Yang to be responsible for handling Fujian affairs, Mr. Chen may not go to Nanjing again.</p>

Dr. Sun Yat-sen explained it very thoroughly in the first lecture of the Three Principles of the People. 'Politics' is the affair of the public, and 'governance' is managing the affairs of the public, which is called politics. You are all people who manage the affairs of the people. Everyone is an intellectual, and the national politics is seen in the newspapers, so there is no need for me to make a report. Today's report has two points: (1) The administrative policy. When I went to other provinces to inspect the judiciary last year, I often saw conflicts between the trial and prosecution departments. So we must not fall into the same situation. The Procuratorate should cooperate with the court. The duty of the prosecutor is to represent the state and to prosecute crimes with the mentality of eliminating evil completely. Now that the National Government is working hard to ban smoking, it is especially hoped that the trial department will handle it strictly. There are many cases of kidnapping in Shanghai. In order to seek happiness for the society, we must try our best to eradicate this bad stain. (2) The policy of using people. In my years of service, what I hate most is the frequent changes of civil servants, which results in a great loss to the government's work, especially in the judicial field. There should be a certain stability. Then, if someone works hard, I will promote him in the future. All the old people, even the clerks and bailiffs, remain in their old positions so that everyone can work in peace. This is my sincerity to you all." It was already 10 o'clock, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>A Brief Explanation of Spitting and Hygiene</p>
<p>The news of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau's hosting of the 5th Sanitation Campaign has been recorded in previous newspapers. It is heard that the bureau dispatched administrators and health inspectors to post slogans, distribute various printed materials, and supervise the street cleaners to clean up the work, which was very busy. Moreover, the bureau paid special attention to publicizing the work of preventing cholera this time. Among the slogans posted in various places, there were also many of this item. In addition, the bureau recently received a kind of brief explanation of spitting and hygiene issued by the Ministry of Health, which details the harm of spitting at will. The bureau has distributed it to citizens for attention in the past two days. There are many people in our society who commit the bad habit of spitting at will. The following is the original text of a brief explanation of spitting and hygiene in order to reform those who commit this bad habit.</p>
<p>Spitting and Hygiene Tuberculosis is caused by tuberculosis bacteria. Bacteria are microorganisms, a kind of very small living thing that cannot be seen with the naked eye. If we magnify them with a special magnifier called a microscope, we can see them. If there is no tuberculosis bacteria, tuberculosis will never occur. The range of tuberculosis bacteria spread is very wide, so many people are often unknowingly infected with tuberculosis because of contact with this dangerous object. However, although tuberculosis bacteria are widely present, their concentration and toxicity vary greatly from place to place. Like those scattered in the air, they are usually very thin and their toxicity is very weak. Conversely, the sputum of tuberculosis patients, their sputum foam is the most concentrated and has a strong toxic danger. If we use numbers and words to express their intensity, the air is equivalent to one, and the sputum is equivalent to one hundred million to one hundred billion. It can be seen that the sputum spread of the virus is terrible. The place where tuberculosis bacteria multiply is in the patient's diseased part. Although there are countless tuberculosis bacteria hidden in the body, when the lung disease is in its early stage, it is not mixed in the sputum and discharged from the body. The sputum foam in the transmission is not at all dangerous. After a certain period of time, the tuberculosis bacteria in the sputum will be mixed in the spit blood and discharged to the outside of the body, or the patient will swallow the sputum and mix it in the feces, and a large amount is discharged, or the patient himself suffers from intestinal tuberculosis, and it is discharged from the feces. Or like kidney tuberculosis, bladder tuberculosis, the patient's certain period can also discharge a large amount of tuberculosis bacteria from the urine, which is all contagious dangerous. In addition, nasal mucus, eye secretions, pus, milk, blood, etc. are also the causes of tuberculosis infection. All these sources of tuberculosis bacteria discharge should not be taken lightly and ignored. Among them, the most important thing in tuberculosis prevention is sputum. Now let's divide sputum into four types according to the degree of danger. The first is the sputum spit out by the patient, including the sputum in the sputum bowl and the cloth or paper with viscous sputum. The second is the sputum foam spit out by the patient's cough and sneeze, including the sputum foam when talking and laughing. The third is the general articles, food and drink, and fingers attached to the patient's sputum or sputum foam. The fourth is the air scattered in the dust after the sputum or sputum foam dries. In terms of these four types, the size of its danger is the same as their order. Spitting is very important. Tuberculosis bacteria are colorless microorganisms. Assuming that we make them red, then the sputum will be very thick red. As for the items around the patient's bedding, they can also be regarded as dots of red. The fingers of the caregiver can also be dyed the color of red sputum. The sputum color is thick, which means important. The sputum has a strong adhesion, and sputum foam is easily attached to objects, and can stay anytime and anywhere. Although it dries and peels off later, it is difficult to reduce the danger, but it can preserve it for a long time. The resistance to drying is very strong. After several months, and even years, it still does not lose its vitality and infectivity. This dried sputum is gradually ground into powder and scattered in the air with the dust, or with the fine silk of clothes, paper, cloth, etc., and then invades people's respiratory organs. Also, flies are very good at licking sputum, or sticking sputum on their feet, and then they fly to people's mouths or food, or fly to the neighbor's house, reaching far away, and it is easy to spread tuberculosis bacteria anytime and anywhere, so the most dangerous thing to be infected is sputum. However, there is a big difference in the intensity of tuberculosis infection between new sputum and dry sputum. Directly inhaling the sputum foam from the patient's cough and sneeze is new sputum, which is very dangerous and has a strong infection. If you inhale air with very thin dry tuberculosis bacteria, this is dry sputum, which is less dangerous and has a weak infection. In the middle of these two, there are also various levels. It can be seen that it is not good to spit at will anytime and anywhere, and it can infect people regardless of the size of the danger. Tuberculosis bacteria invade the body and do not directly cause disease. If it reaches the lungs, it becomes pulmonary tuberculosis, and it does not directly cause disease. It takes several months to decades to gradually spread. However, tuberculosis bacteria are not limited to always proceeding so slowly. If you get a suitable opportunity to invade and facilitate proliferation, it can also proceed rapidly. So the onset of tuberculosis is after infection, as early as dozens of days, and as late as decades, and the symptoms of onset are very clear, and there are also completely unclear. A pulmonary tuberculosis patient can cough up tens of millions of tuberculosis bacteria in 24 hours. When the patient coughs heavily, fine sputum foam is often sprayed out of the mouth. All people within three or four feet can be harmed by it. If this sputum foam does not directly invade people, it will fall on the ground and soon dry out with dust, spreading in the phlegm-containing mucus. When it dries, it sticks firmly, and it is not easy to wash off, and it becomes a contagious preparation object. All sputum spat on the ground or in trams, trains, and public places is very harmful to people. Sometimes our soles or skirt hems, if they stick to undried sputum, and living bacteria can lead the bacteria into our homes, and gradually become dust. If it is in a place with insufficient sunlight, the life of the bacteria will live longer, and our lives will suffer more infectious disasters, because the bacteria cannot move automatically in the dark, but brooms and feather dusters can help them fly and scatter on household items. Whoever uses these items has the risk of inhaling bacteria and the opportunity to infect tuberculosis, so never spit anytime and anywhere to avoid the spread of this bacteria. Sputum should always be spit in a sputum bucket or sputum bowl, etc. If you want to prevent flies from flying around the sputum bowl, you can add a lid, and you can add water to the sputum bucket. It would be better if you could add disinfectant and antiseptic solution to the sputum bucket, such as the above. If you have a fairly large clean paper, or new cotton gauze or cloth, etc., when you can't find a sputum bucket or sputum bowl for a while, spit on them and then burn them, that's even better. Also, when coughing and sneezing, whether it is yourself or others, you should use this paper or cotton gauze or cloth or small handkerchief, etc., to cover your mouth and nose, and you can also prevent the spread of sputum foam if you have to use your hands. Be careful when talking to tuberculosis patients. This paper, cotton gauze, cloth, etc., should also be disinfected in the same way. Do not spit at will anywhere, whether it is in a house, on land, or on the floor. Everyone should do this, always do this, and be careful to encourage each other to prevent and reduce the occurrence of tuberculosis. In addition, do not swallow tuberculosis to avoid damaging appetite, causing intestinal tuberculosis, and allowing tuberculosis bacteria to exist in feces, discharge and spread. The sputum bucket, sputum bowl, etc. used should also be disinfected at any time. The best disinfection method is steaming and boiling. If it is not easy to do, a simple method is to repeatedly rinse with boiling water and expose it to the sun more.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Health Bureau Will <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Give Cholera Vaccinations to Workers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Health Bureau sent a letter to various factories, stating: "Respectfully informing you that cholera (commonly known as 'luo sha jiao chang sha' or 'diao jiao sha') frequently occurs in Shanghai every summer and autumn, causing great harm. Based on the bureau's investigations over the years, laborers are particularly susceptible to cholera. This is because laborers' living conditions are simpler, and they often only seek cheap food and drink without careful selection, which is one reason why laborers are prone to cholera. Secondly, laborers work in crowded places with frequent contact, so if one person has cholera, it is easily spread. Workers are the most important element of a factory's production. From the perspectives of moral sentiment, industrial economics, and long-term planning, factories should relieve workers of this unknown suffering. This aligns with the virtues of universal love and mutual assistance, and it is also the key to harmonious collective work. This bureau has submitted a proposal to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, which has been approved, to promote cholera vaccinations this year, especially focusing on laborers and those living in shantytowns. The bureau will schedule personnel to administer the vaccinations, all free of charge, without any expense to the factories. However, regarding the laborers, their education levels vary, and they may not fully understand these preventative measures, or they may be stubborn, viewing epidemics as natural disasters and believing they are unavoidable, or they may start but not finish due to slight reactions from the vaccination (each person must be vaccinated twice to be effective). In order to prevent epidemics, protect laborers, maintain social economy, and increase productive capacity, this bureau will schedule personnel to your factory to administer cholera vaccinations. It is hoped that your manager, along with staff and foremen, will first enthusiastically educate the workers, so that everyone receives the vaccination to prevent epidemics and value life. Attached is a simplified Chinese notice. Please review it and explain it to the workers to enlighten them and put it into practice. Also, please fill out and return the enclosed application form so that we can schedule personnel to administer the vaccination at your factory."</p>

<p>Requests Instructions on Relief Measures for the Cotton Textile Industry</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau believes that the cotton textile industry in this city is declining daily and urgently needs relief. Having no ideas, they specifically submitted a request to the Municipal Government yesterday for instructions. The original request is transcribed in full below: "Submitting a request for instructions: It has been observed that recently, over a dozen cotton textile factories in this city have successively closed down. The remaining factories are mostly in precarious situations and may close at any moment. The factory owners in this industry have repeatedly appealed for a reduction in wages to ease the burden so that they can勉力搘撑. However, the workers in this industry claim that their wages are already low and request that the conditions be revised and wages increased to maintain their livelihood. After investigating the logic and emotions on both sides, the bureau feels that neither can be faulted. The bureau feels particularly challenged in resolving this situation. The cotton textile industry has been deeply affected by the economic invasion of foreign merchants, making it difficult to compete with them. In addition, heavy taxes, slow sales, accumulation of inventory, and difficulties in financial turnover have led to repeated bankruptcies and closures. The request to reduce wages cannot be approved because it is not convenient. However, if expenses are not reduced and costs lowered, there will inevitably be a day when it is impossible to continue. Moreover, in the current situation of 米珠薪桂, the difficult living conditions of cotton textile workers are also a reality. However, if a wage increase is approved, it would be equivalent to accelerating the demise of the cotton textile industry. 皮之不存, 毛將焉傅 The bureau believes that the fundamental solution still lies in alleviating all the current difficulties of the cotton textile industry, such as how to circulate accumulated goods, how to provide financial assistance, and how to reduce taxes. All of this seems beyond the capabilities of a single city. The bureau is troubled and unable to make a decision. Furthermore, recalling the past winter when the industry requested relief funds, efforts were repeatedly made to coordinate with the National Goods Bank and others, but all were ineffective. The direction of handling is unknown. Therefore, this document is prepared and submitted, requesting that your Excellency review it and issue instructions for compliance. This is for the public good. Respectfully submitted to Mayor Zhang."</p>

<h3 id="e162">Jisheng Society Held Relief Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society held a relief meeting in this city yesterday. The chairman and vice-chairmen Wang Yiting, Xu Qianlin, and Huang Hanzhi, as well as over thirty committee members, attended. First, Chairman Wang announced the purpose of the meeting and requested the two directors of relief economics to report on recent situations. The Relief Director reported: (1) Zhejiang Taitai Disaster Relief: According to a letter from Director Feng Yangshan, bandits are everywhere in the provinces, and the people are suffering. Although winter relief was provided last year, it was just a drop in the bucket. Current investigations are difficult, relief workers are exhausted from traveling from Wenzhou to Taitai, and relief funds are extremely scarce, making the process difficult. (2) Jiangsu Disaster Relief: Bao Ying County was reported by Director Liu Shulun to be severely affected. 36,000 yuan and then another 10,000 yuan were remitted, but it was still a struggle, and dozens of counties in Jiangbei are asking for relief, but only a few are receiving it. In terms of financial resources, it is very difficult, but it is uneasy in the heart, so Huaiyin County was also added, with Zhou Yuankai as the director. It's just a drop in the bucket, but it is only a little decoration. (3) Anhui Disaster Relief: Over thirty counties in the province have been affected, and bandits are rampant. The people are in distress and continuously asking for help, but we cannot respond. Yiwu and Wu counties have already been addressed, and now Chuzhou County has been added, with Xia Fuyi as the director. Inspections are currently underway. (4) The Beijing Disaster Relief Congee Kitchen has been closed, but the starving people in Nankou are starving and have repeatedly requested assistance, so we have to provide a fourth relief, and we plan to distribute seeds as well. Mr. Zhu Ziqiao has already purchased 8,000 yuan worth of seeds and will distribute them separately. (5) Henan Disaster Relief: Bandits are rampant throughout the province, especially in western Henan. Shaanxi, Dangbao, Xin'an, and Mianchi are even more miserable. A congee kitchen was set up in Shaanxi County, and our association continues to operate it. Mr. Zhu Ziqiao personally allocated 10,000 yuan and purchased another 10,000 yuan worth of seeds for transportation and distribution. (6) Shaanxi Disaster Relief: Director Zhang Xianqing led the relief workers north and arrived in Shaanxi in April. A telegram reported that the disaster is even worse than last year, and the human hell is truly unbearable to read. (7) Immigration to the Northeast: Our association is responsible for the costs from Fengtai to Yuguan. The first batch of 1,150 people has already been sent, and more will be sent successively. Next, the Economics Director reported that our association has received considerable assistance and donations from comrades and enthusiastic people from all walks of life. There are even women who have sold their ornaments to help the relief effort. The disaster victims are fortunate to receive such kind assistance, but the disaster is widespread, and universal relief is difficult. According to the current report from the Relief Director, only one-thousandth of the national disaster area is receiving relief. The current budget of our association is severely short. Please collect the advance funds that you all have agreed to pay, etc. Chairman Wang said, "Our association is an organization formed by compassionate comrades who have come together. We are fulfilling our relief duties with conscience. We will do as much relief work as we can with our capabilities. We hope everyone will work hard and never give up to achieve our goal." A committee member said, "The funding for the relief of the provinces that are currently being discussed is extremely scarce, which is conceivable. Yesterday, someone said to me, 'Your association's enthusiasm and perseverance are admirable, but your strength is weak and your burden is heavy, and it will be difficult to support. It is highly possible that things will be stranded one day.' After careful consideration, this is indeed the truth. It is hoped that you will jointly devise good strategies and recruit compassionate and benevolent people from all over the world to participate as much as possible in order to maintain long-term operations." Chairman Wang deeply agreed with his words, and the majority unanimously agreed, hoping that someone with human and financial resources can do whatever they can, save whoever they can, and rely on their conscience to invoke heavenly harmony and reverse the浩刧. There is probably a chance to get something done.</p>
<h3 id="e163">The Chamber of Commerce Union Begins Reorganization <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The Printing Press Union of the Commercial Press on Baoshan Road, Zhabei, in this city has been established for many years. It has a large membership and occupies a significant position among various unions. Recently, due to the complexity of internal elements and frequent disputes, the People's Training Committee of the Municipal Party Department has repeatedly received requests for sanctions from many union members. The eighth meeting resolved to reorganize the union. The rationale is recorded below:</p>
<p>The Reasons for the Citizen Training Committee to Reorganize the Chamber of Commerce Union: The committee previously received a joint accusation from workers such as Zhang Youquan of the Chinese character department of the Commercial Press Printing Press, alleging that the executive supervisory committee of the union colluded with the Communist Party, conspired to revolt, and asked that they be punished quickly to stop the trouble. While this was being reviewed, another statement from Xing Aiqing and other workers from the lead printing department listed facts, accusing the executive supervisory committee of inciting labor unrest, being hostile to the government, harboring reactionaries, and plotting illegal activities, and requested a prompt investigation. Furthermore, Shi Jinguan and other workers from the binding department submitted a request stating that the union was being run by the wrong people, the workers were repeatedly oppressed, reactionaries were rampant, and the environment was dangerous, and they appealed for severe punishment of the leaders and reorganization of the union. After investigation, it was found that the Chamber of Commerce Printing Press Union has been run by the wrong people in recent years. Internal disputes have repeatedly arisen, the organization is loose, the elements are complex, the corrupt are taking the opportunity to collect money and exploit the workers, and the unscrupulous are taking the opportunity to incite and disrupt the public order. They even despise the government and violate party orders, with numerous flaws and obvious crimes. One or two examples are listed below to summarize the rest. It was found that before the party convened the Third National Congress, the Central Committee ordered all levels of people's organizations to suspend meetings during the meeting period. However, union committee members Tan Huanxiang, Ge Hecai and others disregarded the law and arbitrarily convened secret meetings of various unions on March 12, plotting to oppose the Third Plenary Session and pushed representative Gu to go to Beijing to participate in the National People's Congress called by the reactionaries to confront the Third Plenary Session of the Party. The evidence was established, and the Sixth District Party Department impeached them. Later, the party headquarters gave them a light warning, but on June 8 of the same year, the union secretly convened a meeting of various unions in Zhabei, with Communist Party remnants such as Zhou Feng participating in it, plotting an uprising. Fortunately, the party headquarters noticed it and went with the Public Security Bureau to stop it, and no incident occurred. Therefore, the Sixth District Party Department decided at the Third Plenary Session to expel Tan Huanxiang and Ge Hecai from the party to warn the others. However, the party headquarters was broad-minded and only warned Tan et al., hoping that they would turn over a new leaf. However, the union thought that the party headquarters did not dare to compete with it, so it intensified its efforts to expel a large number of comrades in retaliation. When the association went to negotiate, they threatened to strike. On the one hand, they resumed the excessive collection of special donations, and engaged in private corruption. Later, after the workers reported the matter, the Social Affairs Bureau intended to inspect its accounts, but the union refused to hand them over and dared to incite other unions to unanimously oppose the government's audit. As a result, the Nanhuo Industry Workers' Union and others followed suit. Recently, the union went on strike without authorization because it was not able to obtain a wage increase, and it demanded rice subsidies without mediation. Its actions of shaking people's hearts and disrupting the rear were very obvious. The Central Committee had already stipulated that there would be no holiday for the May 9th Memorial, but the union argued strongly and dared to stop work without authorization. Its contempt for the law and its hostility to the government are largely similar. This committee deeply believes that tolerance will only breed evil, and forbearance will only prolong chaos. A single spark can start a prairie fire, and a trickle will turn into a river. If the Chamber of Commerce Printing Press Union disregards laws, is hostile to the government, colludes with reactionaries, and plots illegal activities, if it is not resolved early, the consequences will be endless. Therefore, the committee decided at its eighth meeting to order the Chamber of Commerce Printing Press Union to suspend its activities and await reorganization. The current executive supervisory committee members of the union should be dismissed, and Wang Wenhua and other seventeen people should be appointed as reorganizers, and Hou Dachun and Yang Qingyuan should be appointed as instructors. In addition to sending orders and letters separately, the reasons for reorganizing the union are briefly stated on the right for your information. The People's Training Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>

<p>Pays Attention to the Canal Embankment Project in Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Temporary Relief Association sent a telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Government: "To Chairman Ye of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Urgent. Northern Jiangsu has suffered successive disasters and its vitality has been exhausted. Spring relief has not yet been completed, and continuous heavy rain has caused the canal to rise sharply. Before the flood season, the marker has already reached above one zhang. The canal dike is built as a建瓴, but spring repairs have not yet been carried out. If the water volume increases again, it will inevitably be in danger of collapsing. If a breach occurs, then more than ten counties in Huaiyang will suddenly become a泽国, and millions of people will face the danger of being fish. We urge you to take pity on the remaining people and quickly propose and decide to allocate huge sums of money to the responsible authorities to rush to carry out summer prevention measures to make up for it and avoid accidents. On the one hand, instruct the departments in charge to consider opening the water discharge dams in advance to widen the outlet to抽釜之薪. This is a matter of great importance. We await your benevolent plan. Wang Zhen, Huang Yilin, Huang Qinglan, etc. of the Jiangsu Temporary Relief Association."</p>

<p>To Redeem from Master Shen San</p>
<p>In the Yawo Sand area, located about a dozen miles offshore from the Wusong estuary, piracy has been rampant recently, and major kidnapping cases have occurred from time to time. A certain person with the surname of Mou was kidnapped from the sand some time ago and was redeemed for 1,000 yuan. The person had just been released when, at about 9:00 PM the other night, Ma Baoshan, the third small owner of the Mahetai Fish Shop in Dongzhen, aged 26, was having dinner at home with his wife and three-year-old daughter when suddenly many pirates came, each armed with pistols and Mauser guns, and tied up Ma and his wife and daughter and took them to the bandit ship. The bandits then went to Xizhen, when it was already 10:00 PM, intending to kidnap the owner of Gu Hengmao Grocery Store, but the owner was not there, so they kidnapped his concubine and two shop assistants. It has been over a week now, and although the families of the two have been searching everywhere, there has been no news. Until yesterday, the Ma family received a letter from the bandits, saying that they needed to prepare 15,000 yuan and go to Master Shen San's place at Crescent Moon Harbor near Caozhen to redeem the three Baoshan couples, etc. After receiving the letter, Ma Xingfan, Baoshan's father, was very anxious because the other party was asking for too much money and he could not afford it. The person is an ordinary businessman and not from a wealthy family. Recently, there has been a large population and difficult living conditions, resulting in income not meeting expenses, so he has no ability to rescue his sons, etc.</p>

<p>Wang Qiushan, a Taoist from Pudong, who is in his sixties and lives at No. 166 Xiafei Road, French Concession, has a young daughter, Wang Xiaomei, also known as Yao Wangshi. She is 20 years old this year and was betrothed at the age of five to Yao Hongshan, the owner of the Yao Tongxing Copper Shop in Gaojia Lane, Pudong. The two got married on March 24 of this year, according to the lunar calendar. The young couple had a harmonious relationship, but Xiaomei had lived in Shanghai for a long time. Before marriage, she worked as a female hairstylist, a relaxed and comfortable job. After marriage, she could not get used to the hardship of working in the rural fields and felt lonely living in the countryside. She was often ridiculed by her aunt and younger sister-in-law. Therefore, when visiting her parents, she complained and cried. After her parents persuaded her in every possible way, she returned to her husband's house. This time, when she visited her parents on the 11th of this month, she refused to go back to her husband's house. Her parents tried to persuade her but she refused to listen. The night before, her father persuaded her again and decided to send her home yesterday, but Xiaomei refused and cried, and then had thoughts of suicide. At about 7:00 AM yesterday, she secretly swallowed 生烟 and committed suicide. At 9:00 AM, her family noticed her pale face and immediately sent her to Renji Hospital for treatment. Her husband happened to come to visit and rushed to the hospital upon hearing the news. Unfortunately, she had been poisoned too deeply and the treatment was ineffective. She died at 11:30 AM at noon. The hospital notified the police, who sent detectives to carry the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall corpse examination office. The criminal section reported to the French Public Court Judge Zhu Chengshen, who came to the office at 2:00 PM in the afternoon to confirm the cause of death. He sat in court and questioned the father of the deceased. He was instructed to examine the body and found that the deceased had indeed committed suicide by taking poison. He instructed the father of the deceased to prepare a coffin and collect the body.</p>

<p>Uncontrollably Takes Poison</p>
<p>Wang Yubao, a prostitute of Hunan origin, who is now 37 years old, has been working as a笑生涯at No. 1 Runfuli, Hanzhen, with a flourishing business. An American sailor named Pengguan often visited Wang's prostitute and lingered there. The two were deeply in love and made vows of love. Later, Peng traveled far away. At first, he still exchanged letters with Wang's prostitute from time to time, with deep affection in the lines. Then the news sank. Wang's prostitute was not without sorrow. Later, Tang Yuanjun, a tea merchant from Guangdong, lived there and saw that Wang's prostitute was quite beautiful and was very interested in her. He redeemed her for 500 yuan and lived with her. Last year, they came to Shanghai and lived in Zhabei. Wang still did not forget her old love for Pengguan. When Tang was away, she often took out the English letter that Peng had sent her and read it. Some time ago, her apartment was about to be demolished and rebuilt, so she moved to Room 20 of the Beizhan Hotel on Jielu, near the North Railway Station. Later, when Tang went out, Wang's prostitute faced Peng's portrait, lost in thought, and wept again and again. At the end, she took Lysol disinfectant to try to die. When the tea servant noticed, he quickly rushed her to Guangren Hospital, but she died shortly after. He notified the Huizi police station, who sent detectives to investigate and took the corpse to the corpse examination office on Fulin Road. Yesterday morning, Xu Mei, a prosecutor commissioned by the Special District Local Court, came to the office to confirm the cause of death. He took the seat and immediately heard the tea servant of the hotel narrate the facts. Tang Yuanjun also surrendered and requested to claim the body for coffin burial in order to complete the love and righteousness. Then, patrolman Wang Yufu submitted a photo of Peng and a letter from Peng to Wang found in Wang's prostitute's apartment for inspection. Mr. Xu then instructed that the deceased Wang Yubao had indeed committed suicide by taking poison after losing love with the American Pengguan. It is now based on Tang Yuanjun, who cohabitated, requesting to claim the body for coffin burial in order to complete the love and righteousness, which should be approved.

<h3 id="e171">Municipal Authorities Urge Repair <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The Road Surface on Both Sides of the Tram Tracks</p>
<p>The road surface on both sides of the tram tracks on the city's various roads has been in disrepair for many years and is severely damaged, which is detrimental to both traffic and appearance. The Municipal Works and Public Affairs Bureaus, in view of this, discussed four rectification methods in March: (1) A strong road base should be added in stages on both sides of the tram tracks in order to achieve lasting results. (2) The road base of the tram tracks on Minguo Road (from Xiaodongmen to Laoximen) should be rebuilt according to the Dongmen Road method. (3) The track engineering on Minguo Road should be completed by the end of September this year. (4) The road surface on both sides of all tram tracks on asphalt roads should be repaired by the end of April this year. The Huashang Electric Company was ordered to comply with these regulations. The section of the tram tracks on Minguo Road belonging to the French Concession was also instructed by the Public Affairs Bureau to order the French Electric Tram Company to build a solid road base, which was also limited to be completed by the end of September to achieve consistency. These bureaus are now investigating that the road surface on both sides of the tram tracks on asphalt roads has not been completed beyond the deadline, and the construction of a solid road base on Minguo Road should also be prepared as soon as possible. Therefore, the two tram companies, Huafa, are ordered separately to urge them to proceed and must be completed by the end of September at the latest.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Record of the Demolition of the Imperial-Bestowed Yangdian Temple <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The Imperial-Bestowed Yangdian Temple in Pudong, scheduled to reopen the day before yesterday, was subjected to the demolition of over a hundred idols within by the local Party branch in the afternoon, in order to eradicate superstition. Only five or six statues, including Guan Yu and Yue Fei, were spared. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e175">A Brief History of the Temple: The Imperial-Bestowed Yangdian Temple in Pudong is located approximately six li east of Lujiazui in Pudong, not far from Yangjing Town. It is an ancient temple in Pudong, housing the Great Emperor of the Eastern Peak, the Ten Kings of Hell, and various idols such as Guan Gong and Yue Fei, numbering no less than one hundred. The exact year of its construction is difficult to ascertain. It is said that it was renovated once during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. It comprises three courtyards, occupying approximately three to four mu of land, and the construction is quite grand. During the annual spring incense season, pious men and women flock to burn incense and worship. Even from various places in Puxi, many people come across the river to pray at the temple. The popularity of incense offerings over the years is unparalleled among the temples in Pudong. <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Reasons for Sealing: The temple has been managed by the Shen family, a family of Taoist priests residing in Yangjing, with each branch of the family taking turns to manage it annually. However, since the renovation of the temple buildings during the Qianlong period, they have not undergone major repairs, leading to dilapidation. The local populace laments the vicissitudes of time. The year before last, the temple gate collapsed suddenly due to the rotten foundation, injuring several vendors. Shortly thereafter, disputes arose among the Shen family regarding management, leading to a fatal incident. After investigating various corrupt practices, the government ordered the Public Security Bureau to seal the temple and deploy several police officers to maintain a constant presence, prohibiting superstitious activities such as burning incense and worship.</p>
<p>Scheduled Opening: Since the temple was sealed by the authorities, two years have passed. Although some people have occasionally sneaked in to burn incense, their numbers are scarce. The once grand historical site has fallen into a state of desolation. Local officials and gentry have long had the idea of petitioning for its reopening. After several discussions, it was generally agreed that the ancient site of thousands of years should be preserved and not hastily abandoned. Therefore, they submitted a request to the municipal authorities, recommending nine members of a management committee to raise funds for reconstruction and create a new appearance. It was also decided to reopen the temple on the 18th of this month so that Buddhist believers and pilgrims from near and far could come to burn incense during the incense season.</p>
<p>Circumstances of Demolition: Upon learning of the reopening of the temple, the Pudong Fifth District Party branch issued a declaration vehemently opposing it, and various local public organizations also expressed various forms of opposition. On the day before yesterday, when the reopening was scheduled, the pilgrims who came to burn incense were extremely crowded, suddenly restoring the lively scene before the sealing. In the afternoon, dozens of members of the anti-superstition association organized by the Party branch also arrived and took strict measures to destroy the clay and wooden idols in the front and rear halls. The statue of the Great Emperor of the Eastern Peak in the center was particularly large, so it took many people to drag and dismantle it before it was overthrown. In this operation, more than a hundred idols, large and small, in the temple, except for five or six statues such as Guan Gong and Yue Fei at the gate, were all smashed into piles of mud. They took photos as evidence, shouted slogans, and dispersed. It is reported that the Party branch plans to convert the temple into a Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in the future.</p>

<p>Accomplices to Be Tried Together</p>
<p>Cao Jinbiao and others, who were arrested for forming a gang to rob and injure people, were previously released after the inland detectives were bribed. The other day they were recaptured by detectives from the Public Concession in the French Concession. According to Cao's confession, the Chinese and Western detectives, together with the French Concession police, arrested three more male and female bandits and confiscated weapons. This was detailed in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the confiscated weapons included four pistols, two of each type, and 370 rounds of ammunition. Detective Shen Chongli, Detectives Pang Ruiqing, Ji Honglin, along with the three male and female bandits Zhang Anfu (alias Yao Peinian), Li Wushi, and Song Zhushi, were taken back to the Gordon Road Police Station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Special District Local Court, where Magistrate Wu Tingqi interrogated them. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that the previously arrested defendants in this case were scheduled to be tried on the 26th, so he requested that these three also be included in the case for trial. Questioned, Zhang Anfu confessed that he had been intimate with Li Wushi for a long time. Yesterday morning, he went to her house at No. 13, Liuhe Lane, Huanghe Road, and was arrested along with her. As for the confiscated weapons, he claimed to be unaware of them. Li Wushi confessed that she had been ill at home recently, and Zhang came to visit her, but she knew nothing about the weapons. According to Song Zhushi, the weapons found in her house at No. 42, Tianxiang Lane, Beile Road, were deposited by Cao Jinbiao. Magistrate Wu ordered the defendants to be detained and adjourned the hearing to the afternoon of the 26th of this month for a joint trial.</p>

<p>Chen Pengnian Fined Nine Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>Unable to Pay, Commuted to Three Hundred Days in Jail</p>
<p>The Ellis Pharmacy on Hankou Road specializes in selling various aphrodisiacs. The Municipal Public Security and Education Bureaus considered this business to be in violation of regulations and requested the Special District Local Court to order the police to search the pharmacy and confiscate a large number of aphrodisiacs. The shop owner was summoned for questioning. This was reported in this newspaper two times prior. Yesterday morning, Magistrate Shen Shumu continued the hearing. The shop owner, Chen Pengnian, had failed to appear for the previous hearing, and the police had requested a warrant for his arrest. Knowing that he could not evade the law for long, he changed his name to Chen Jin and surrendered to the court with his lawyer. Magistrate Shen interrogated him and found Chen Pengnian guilty of selling prohibited aphrodisiacs, seeking only personal profit and disregarding public morals. He was fined nine hundred yuan, or, if unable to pay, sentenced to three hundred days in jail. It is reported that the pharmacy has stopped selling aphrodisiacs, but continues to sell other medications.</p>

<p>The other day the Harbin Police sent detectives along with French police to the Communications Hotel on Rue de Consulat in the French Concession, where they arrested Shen Yulong and others. This was reported yesterday. It is now known that in addition to Shen, the bandits arrested included Wu Baoxian, Wei Zichun, Wang Mingshan, and a woman, Wu Zhaoshi. They were all taken back to the police station. Based on their confessions about the location of the hidden weapons, the police searched a house at No. 1110, Longmen Road, and found 93 rounds of ammunition. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng opened the court for interrogation at the Special District Local Court. According to the police lawyer, the defendant Shen Yulong was deeply involved in the case of shooting Constable No. 875, and Wu Yuxian was armed when he robbed the property of a resident surnamed Mou on North Chengdu Road. He requested a postponement for further investigation. Questioned, Shen admitted to shooting a Chinese constable with his accomplices on Dongyouheng Road, but claimed that the accomplice fired the shot. Wu denied the robbery. The court ordered the defendants to be detained and adjourned the hearing to be combined with the trial of the previously arrested Meng and other bandits.</p>

<p>The Public Bus Company hired White Russians as drivers due to a worker's strike. After the Chinese workers returned to work, some Russians continued to drive. These Russians had only quickly learned driving skills, so they were not very proficient, and accidents were frequent. At 2:35 PM the other day, a Russian driver from the company, Noklodav, was driving public bus No. 5818 north on North Sichuan Road when he struck a child, Luo Ahong, near Wuchang Road. The Russian driver did not stop and continued driving, causing severe injuries to the child. The police officer took the injured child to Tongren Hospital, where he died soon after. The police investigation confirmed the facts and took the child's body to the forensic office on Fielon Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Xu arrived at the office to conduct an autopsy. According to the child's uncle, Chen Jitian, the child's parents are in Hong Kong, and he has sent a telegram to notify them. They will arrive in Shanghai in three or four days, and he will claim the body for burial. Mr. Xu verified the statement and ordered an autopsy, which revealed that the deceased child, Luo Ahong, died from being struck by public bus No. 5818. Based on the request of the child's relative, Chen Xiaotian, to claim the body for burial pending the arrival of the child's parents, his request was approved. The defendant, the Russian Noklodav, will be detained at the police station or released on bail of one thousand yuan pending further investigation.</p>

<p>Gu Yonghua, a 26-year-old resident of Nanshengqiao, Longhua, makes bamboo products in Miezhu Street, Nanshi. Last year, his sister arranged for him to be engaged to Jiang Baozhen from the west of Shengqiao. The betrothal gift was 100 yuan, of which 40 yuan was paid in advance, along with a gold ring and a gold bracelet. The remaining 60 yuan was to be paid upon marriage. Gu chose a lucky date in November for the wedding and instructed his sister to inform the Jiang family. However, last month, Gu's fiancee, Baozhen, suddenly fell ill and died. Her mother prepared a coffin and informed the matchmaker, who in turn informed Gu. Gu was very distressed upon learning of this. Initially, he did not eat or drink for two days. His sister comforted him and offered to find another match. Gu said that he had spent a lot of money on banquets and other expenses for the engagement, and the local custom was to return half of the betrothal gift. He was a craftsman and could not afford this unexpected loss. Recently, a neighbor offered to arrange another match for Gu, and Gu was very happy. Therefore, he invited his sister to his house and asked her to demand the return of the betrothal gift from the Jiang family. The day before yesterday, Gu and his sister went to demand the return. However, the Jiang family said, "My daughter has been betrothed to you. Although she has not yet married, she is already your wife. She has now died from illness. We informed you, but you did not come. We had to prepare a coffin and take care of the burial. The betrothal gift and gold jewelry have all been used up and are still insufficient by dozens of yuan. Please take your wife's coffin and bury it." Gu was furious upon hearing this and insisted on demanding the return. He slammed the table and shouted and argued. The Jiang family called the neighbors, and Gu was beaten and injured. His sister helped him home. He now plans to file a lawsuit with the authorities.</p>

<p>Robbed and Injured on the Road: The other day (18th) was her night shift. Jin entered the factory. Yesterday morning at 6:30 AM she left the factory to go home. While passing in front of No. 275, west end of the cross section between Hongqiao Road and Hollam Road, a car suddenly drove up (rental license No. 51, municipal license No. 30, white license plate with black characters, also said to be a test car plate). There was only the driver in the car. He was heading west from the east. The car came up very quickly. Stopping the car right in front of Jin, the driver intentionally threw the iron crank on the ground, and insisted that Jin pick it up. Jin was unable to refuse, and picked it up. Unexpectedly, the driver grabbed a gold bracelet from Jin's left wrist and a gold earring from her left ear. It was only then that Jin knew she was encountering a robbery. She grabbed the car door and refused to let go. Seeing that the situation was not good, the bandit grabbed Jin's hair, threw her out of the car, causing her to hit her head and fall to the ground. The bandit then made a U-turn and drove north. Patrolman Lu Peiyu of the Wangjialou Fifth Police Station and other stations rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm. The bandit had already fled far away. The injured woman, Wang Jin, was sent to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. It is said that the injuries were severe, and her life may be in danger.</p>
<p>Investigation Reveals Common Technique: After hearing the news, the reporter went to the scene of the incident for investigation. The ground was covered in blood. He pulled off a strand of hair and stuck it back on the head. According to the villagers there, Xue Huolin, the daughter of Xue Shengqi, who lives in Xiaoxuejia House behind Wangjialou, was also robbed of a gold ring worth 20 yuan by car bandits at the corner of Younigan Road when she was returning home from the Shenxin Yarn Factory at about 6:20 AM four days ago. The bandits opened to maximum speed and fled to the north. A similar robbery case has now occurred, and the responsible police station is paying close attention.</p>

<p>Driver Fined Ten Yuan</p>
<p>The French Concession Fire Brigade was rushing to the scene of a fire in the New Concession the other night, when the truck was blocked on Baochang Road by a car driven by Wang Wenbiao. The fire truck was unable to proceed, and nearly suffered an accident. So, the fire brigade's westerner recorded the license plate number and notified the police, who summoned Wang to the French Court for interrogation yesterday. First, Xu Heshang, the fire truck driver, stated what had happened. Wang Wenbiao confessed that it was true that his car was blocking the road because he was turning. The Chinese and Western judge fined Wang ten yuan to be confiscated by the government.</p>

<p>Driver Acquitted of Negligence</p>
<p>Chen Zhangshi, the wife of Chen Jifu, a villager from Suzhou, worked as a servant in Shanghai. On the 12th of this month, while walking across the intersection of Avenue Edouard VII and Zilai Street, she was hit by a truck driven by Wu Dongsheng and killed. The judge verified that the death was true and ordered further investigation. Yesterday, the police summoned both parties to the French Court for interrogation. Chen Jifu, the victim's husband, stated that his wife was killed in a tragic accident and requested justice. Wu Dongsheng stated that he was driving his car slowly from west to east that day, and the deceased was walking from south to north. He honked the horn, but the deceased suddenly retreated, causing her to be hit by the rear wheels of his car. It was the deceased's own carelessness, and not his negligence. He requested that the court investigate. Witness Jiang A-Er's testimony was largely the same as the defendant's. The Chinese and Western judges ruled that the defendant was found to be without fault, dismissed the case, and ordered the defendant to provide compensation.</p>

<p>Four Bandits Flee, One Captured</p>
<p>Victim and Neighbor Injured</p>
<p>Xu Jinlang, 48, a Chongming native, who lives in a straw shed behind the St. John's University Garden in Caojiadu, west of Shanghai, makes a living pushing a cart. He lives at home with his wife, Zhang, 51. At about 1:00 AM yesterday morning, while the elderly couple were sound asleep, five bandits speaking a Jiangbei dialect, each carrying a wooden stick, broke through the door and rushed in. The Xu couple woke up and jumped up. The bandits threatened them to be silent and started searching for loot. Zhang sneaked out and shouted "Bandits!" The bandits were terrified and rushed out together, knocking Zhang to the ground. When the farmers in the neighborhood heard the alarm, they arose en masse. At that time, Hu Luzhong, the patrolman of the Guangfu Road sub-district of the Sixth District, and Liu Shaoqing and Dai Qingyuan, the detectives of the Sixth District, also rushed to the scene one after another and tried their best to capture the bandits. The Zhenru defense force also arrived and fired two shots. Four bandits had already fled with the stolen goods. Only one bandit had been captured by the neighbor, Li Hegen. While the crowd of villagers was beating him, Zhang was also struck in the head by the bandits, and blood was flowing like a stream. The reported losses were small, with a total of four pieces of clothing, a copper foot warmer, a copper teapot, three pairs of shoes, and three blankets stolen. Patrolman Hu took the wooden stick left by the bandits and the apprehended bandit back to the Sixth District Police Station. After separate interrogation by the District Chief Ren, the victim Xu Jinlang, 48, a Chongming native living in Hanbei, and Xu Zhangshi, 51, with injuries to her head and arms, were interviewed. The neighbor Li Hegen, 30, a Jiangyin native who works as a garden watchman, was also interviewed. The bandit confessed his name was Wu Renkui, 32, a Songjiang native who came from the countryside. The police then prepared a document and sent the bandit to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

A-Hai became angry and grabbed an axe from the shelf, striking Xu in the head, causing blood to flow uncontrollably. The perpetrator then fled. People called the police with the car being sent to the Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Sues Brothel Owner</p>
<p>Xi Lindi, a woman of 28, is from Dongting, Jiangsu. She has delicate and pretty features and is charming and clever. Her mother, Xi Wang, because her husband failed in business in Shanghai in the autumn of the 14th year of the Republic of China, abandoned his family and did not return, resulting in extreme poverty. Later, through the introduction of a matchmaker, her beloved daughter Lindi was sold to the brothel of Fan Caixia (沈小妹), on Shantou Road in the Public Concession, and to the brothel owner Zhuang Jinbao in Yufuli, for 300 yuan. They signed a baozhang contract for a term of six years. At that time, Lindi was only thirteen years old. After being sold to the brothel, she recognized Shen and Zhuang as foster mothers. She then began to learn singing and live a life of prostitution. In recent years, Lindi has grown up and knows that, while this place is good, she desires to have her own place. She wants to jump out of the fire pit and restore her freedom. Having detected it, the foster mother keeps a close watch on her and will not allow her to take a step beyond the Thunder Pond all day long. Lindi still has one year left on her contract, but under the foster mother's absolute power, the pain is unbearable. Yesterday, she hired lawyers Jin Yu and Li Yuan to negotiate with the brothel owners Zhuang and Shen through legal procedures, to immediately separate from the foster mother and restore her freedom.</p>

<p>Li Longshou's Paper-Wrapped Firearms</p>
<p>Gao Guangyuan, a 35-year-old man from Yangzhou, worked as a boat watcher at the Nanshi Sanitation Station. Yesterday at around 3:00 PM, Gao was passing by the Dadatou area when he noticed a dung boat docked there for several days without anyone guarding it. While he was wondering about this, Li Longshou, a man from Songjiang, suddenly appeared, hurrying along with a paper package tucked under his arm, intending to board the boat. Gao immediately questioned Li about the origin of the dung boat, but a disagreement quickly escalated into a conflict. Inadvertently, the paper package Li was carrying fell to the ground and broke open. Gao was able to see and expose the hidden secret: inside were firearms. Gao immediately called for Li Fugeng, a policeman from the Third Watch Post in the area, who arrived and apprehended Li. Together, they seized two Browning pistols, 150 bullets, and four magazines from the paper package. As they were about to take Li to the district, another person noticed Li's arrest and immediately ran to hide on a ship docked nearby. This was observed by officers from the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol, who approached, apprehended him, and brought him along with Li to the First District Headquarters. During the preliminary interrogation by the District Chief, Li Longshou confessed that he was 40 years old and had always made a living by farming. He claimed that today, an unknown person had given him the paper package and asked him to take it to Pudong, promising him a generous reward. He insisted that he was unaware of the illegal items inside and had been foolish and greedy, leading him to be deceived. He pleaded for leniency. The other person, Wang Pujiang, 35 years old from Jiashan, claimed he did not know Li and knew nothing about the case. He said he had been startled by the police arresting someone and had fled to hide on the ship. The District Chief, considering the seriousness of the case involving privately carrying firearms, ordered that a written report be prepared and submitted to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Aftermath of the Resolution of the Pharmaceutical Industry Dispute <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>The Labor Union Refutes the Management's Submission. The Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, seeking to refute the absurd submission from the management, submitted a document to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government, which stated (abbreviated title): Regarding the management's defiance of the central government's decision, requesting strict orders to comply. It is hereby reported that after the central government made its decision and the [Municipal] Council and Government jointly consulted and formulated five measures for compliance, both parties were ordered to comply. This union immediately respected the orders and fully complied with them. However, the management refused to be educated and has not complied to this day. Furthermore, yesterday (the 18th), they published an outrageous submission in the newspapers. This union, fearing that the truth would be obscured and that misunderstandings would arise among outsiders, hereby presents a reasoned refutation. The management claims that the central government's six measures are intended to alleviate the hardships of labor and management, and they deeply admire this and will comply with the orders. How, then, can they rely on their own assertions to violate the principles of the central government's decision? They illegally included a severance fee of 2,000 yuan with their submission, requesting that the Chamber of Commerce forward it to the Social Affairs Bureau. These points alone are sufficient to prove that the management's defiance and arrogance are unforgivable. Moreover, the six points presented by the management are not entirely factual, and their reasoning is absurd. It is necessary to reiterate our position to seek justice. The previous work slowdown by this union was caused by the management's excessive oppression, hiring a large number of police officers, arresting and imprisoning workers, insulting representatives of the Party, and falsely accusing them of being reactionary. All workers were filled with righteous indignation, and a decision was made by the general membership meeting to initiate a partial work slowdown. The facts are all there and cannot be concealed. As for the claim that we forcibly imposed a work slowdown without first requesting mediation in accordance with the law, we believe that the management is disregarding the authority of the [Municipal] Government and the [Municipal] Council, and that they are either ignorant or misinformed about the situation. Before this incident occurred, the [Municipal] Council repeatedly ordered the management to implement the measures within a specified period, otherwise the labor side would automatically implement them. Because the management ignored this, neither requesting a postponement nor expressing agreement, this union proceeded to implement the measures automatically after the deadline. Considering the above two points, the responsibility is clearly identifiable, yet they make an exaggerated statement, blaming others, and uttering empty rhetoric to gain sympathy. Like a fox weeping over a rabbit, how shameful is that? This is the first point that should be refuted. The central government deeply understands that the first work slowdown by the labor side was out of desperation, and therefore did not condemn it, but only deducted twelve days of wages. While the central government showed great understanding, the labor side, though dissatisfied, was still able to abide by the law and obey. The word "obedience" is evident here. Why must the management pretend to be sympathetic, offering flattering compassion? This is truly admirable. The second work slowdown occurred after mediation. Whether the responsibility should be attributed to this union or whether workers were coerced into blindly following is a matter for the trade association to consider. As the previous point has already been explained, to argue about fairness and reason is far-fetched. Initiating illegal actions must be denounced, and the intention of the central government must be respected. The question is, what if we do not consider the circumstances and reason? Furthermore, does the central government's decision only refer to wages, or are there other matters? Even if we only consider the telegram regarding wages, it clearly states, "The wages for the twelve days of the strike before the mediation decision are not paid at all. The wages for the strike after the mediation decision should be paid in full by the management." What does "half wages paid during the strike period" refer to? Did the [Municipal] Government and the [Municipal] Council not distribute the central government's telegram to us? Is the [Municipal] Government's and the [Municipal] Council's instruction No. 4150 a forgery? In short, the management's intentions are sinister, confusing and misleading, attempting to deceive the public. This is the second point that should be refuted. Regarding the allowance, in the [Municipal] Government's and the [Municipal] Council's instruction No. 35, the second item of the central government's decision states, "Workers who are found unqualified by the Mediation Committee will be given severance pay by the management as a gesture of compassion." and the second item of the consultation decision of the same number of the [Municipal] Government and the [Municipal] Council states, "The 51 people who are found unqualified by the [Municipal] Council and the Social Affairs Bureau will still be handled according to the decision of the Mediation Committee, and they will be given 20 yuan each as severance pay by the trade association." Where did the management's so-called 100 unemployed workers come from? Furthermore, is the date of the [Municipal] Government's instruction No. 589 after the central government's decision? If so, then the [Municipal] Government will also be at fault for violating the central government's decision. Furthermore, they said, "After the severance, there should be no pharmaceutical industry unemployment in Shanghai." How contradictory! The reason for unemployment is purely due to the management's oppression, unwarranted dismissal, and excessive recruitment of apprentices, who fill the positions of workers upon completion of their apprenticeship, leading to increasing unemployment. This union's placement plan is only a temporary solution. The fundamental solution has already been outlined in the submission to the central government, and the central government, understanding the hardships of the people, has ordered the [Municipal] Government and the [Municipal] Council to formulate a proper plan after the resolution of this turmoil, in order to resolve the dispute. Perhaps the management has made every effort to place the unemployed, and will never again recruit apprentices or dismiss workers. This union should naturally rejoice. However, the number of 100 people for severance is not in accordance with the facts. This is the third point that should be refuted. The substitute worker system was established by signed agreement and cannot be changed. Now, the management is using the name of severance to recklessly attempt to abolish the substitute worker system. Their devious plan is truly admirable. The management's arrangement is meticulous, and their means are highly astute. However, there is no explicit provision in the central government's decision to abolish the substitute worker system. The management's defiance of the law is evident. This is the fourth point that should be refuted. The central government has decided that the placement of unemployed workers, the number of people, and six other items should be properly handled by the [Municipal] Government and the [Municipal] Council, and the [Municipal] Government and the [Municipal] Council have jointly decided on five measures for compliance. All parties should absolutely comply. However, the management is only seeking their own benefit, openly denying and falsely using the name of human rights to slander the committees' allocation of people to various stores, undermining the agreement, violating orders, and being ignorant of the possibility of temporality and specificity. They want to use the order before the central government clearly understood the facts of this case to deceive the world, trying to cover up the new with the old. How clumsy is their scheme! With the dignity of the central government, the management actually wants to give orders and ask the central government to withdraw its decision, which is too convenient. The National Government's approval was inevitably deceived by the management. I believe that since the central government has already made a decision, the National Government should also comply. If the organization is like this, how can they use biased views to distort and fabricate the truth, and then use it as a basis for resistance? I dare to tell the responsible personnel of the management: don't dream. You must know that although money is all-powerful, it sometimes loses its effect. Justice will prevail, and it will never be destroyed. This is the fifth point that should be refuted. Feng Jinpu's arrest was a confidential order from a higher level, because Feng dared to violate the central government's decision and represented the management, going to Beijing to lobby. His reactionary crime has long been proven, and his arrest is already a lenient sentence. This union received a confidential order to assist in the arrest. Since the management has questioned this, this union should explain it, so that the outside world can understand the truth. This is the sixth point that should be refuted. Once the above six points are refuted, justice will be served. I implore the [Municipal] Government and the [Municipal] Council to discern the truth clearly and to make a fair judgment, to strictly order the management to comply within a specified period, refute the management's request, so as to conform to the intention of the central government, to meet the expectations of the public, and to alleviate the hardships of the people. Sincerely submitted, (omitted below)</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Returns the Severance Fee. The Shanghai Pharmaceutical Workers' Union caused a major dispute by requesting that the management place unemployed workers, which attracted the attention of the public. The Social Affairs Bureau repeatedly convened labor and management for mediation, and finally decided on a plan. The management did not agree, resulting in a work slowdown by the entire pharmaceutical industry in the city. Later, the central government decided that the management should place at least 64 unemployed workers in order to prevent the dispute from escalating. After receiving the order, the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union ordered all workers in the city to return to their original positions. However, the management delayed and failed to comply with the order. A few days ago, the Pharmaceutical Trade Association prepared 2,000 yuan in foreign currency and entrusted the Chamber of Commerce to submit it to the Social Affairs Bureau as a severance fee for unemployed workers in the industry. However, the Bureau returned it and replied to the Chamber of Commerce, stating roughly that the recruitment of displaced workers in the pharmaceutical industry only needs to be handled in accordance with the central government's plan.</p>

<p>Whenever there are diplomatic events in civilized countries, they all play their national music to promote their culture. Our country flourished in the Spring and Autumn period, but it has been absent since the Tang Dynasty, which is why foreigners regard us as a country without music. The Datong Music Society in this city has recently compiled new National Music, which is grand in scale and solemn in atmosphere. Listening to it is like the harmonious sounds of phoenixes, making people yearn for the past and recall ancient culture. Recently, the members of the Society's orchestra have been working even harder, and the number of new members has been increasing. In terms of instruments, they have also newly created various instruments such as the twelve-stringed violin, danqin, and bamboo drum, which are all replicas of ancient musical instruments. They have a loud volume and beautiful sound. They attended the garden party of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last Friday, and people from both China and the West highly praised them. At 4 PM on Tuesday afternoon, at Furguson Road and World College, they welcomed the French Minister and Dr. Ma Xuanbo, a special envoy for investigating higher education in China. There were even more people from both China and the West. Chairman Li Shizeng, who is also the executive committee member of the Society, temporarily called all the members to play five movements of the National Music. The sound of drums and applause was continuous in each movement. The French Minister and Dr. Ma, among others, examined each instrument in detail and attached great importance to this initiative for the future of our country's culture, which will add no small amount of luster.</p>

<p>The Xiangya Company on Nanjing Road, at the request of the All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association, is adding a 2% commission during this donation period to aid the disaster in Zhejiang. Xiangya's products are originally of excellent quality. This time, they have reduced prices, and the Association has sent letters to all fellow Zhejiang natives in Shanghai, asking them to go and purchase. Therefore, business has been very prosperous this time. Only because the streetcar and other strikes occurred during the period, and transportation was inconvenient, those fellow Zhejiang natives living a little further away were not able to widely benefit. The Association has requested a letter to continue the donations for 20 more days. Those who love using Xiangya products are fortunate to go and purchase soon.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Tobacco Exchange Industry Reorganization Committee held its fifth reorganization committee meeting yesterday at the meeting place on Lloyd Road. Chen Liangyu, Hong Yisheng, Xu Yunxiang, Teng Zhixiang, Yang Bingyi, Chen Ruilin, and others attended the meeting as scheduled. First, the chairman reported on the situation of dispatching personnel to various roads to fill out the volunteer forms and issued price lists. After discussion, it was decided to rush the volunteer forms to facilitate registration, and the following items were specifically agreed upon: (1) The deadline for completing the membership volunteer forms and price lists originally agreed upon last time was one week. Now, due to procedural issues, the deadline is extended for another five days, and all must be completed to avoid prolonged delays. (2) For tobacco stores that openly sell goods at low prices, which violate the association's rules and damage the industry, in addition to posting notices in the market, the committee will send a letter to the Chamber of Commerce for Reorganization, which will forward it to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau, and then consult with the central regional police stations in various jurisdictions to take care of the committee's staff when they are persuading the tobacco stores selling at low prices, in order to maintain the industry and facilitate progress. (3) This committee's solicitation of membership from the industry aims to be widespread. Within the scope of this special municipality, in addition to merging and reorganizing the original three member groups, it is feared that the procedures in the vast urban area may be incomplete. In addition to appointing Xiang Dalong Store in the Wusong District, Lao Taihe Store in the Jiangwan District, and Mr. Weng Kangfu in Pudong to assist in the process, the committee should contact the remaining townships separately. Those who wish to join can fill out and submit volunteer forms in order to achieve perfection and avoid omissions. (4) Regarding the joint letter from fellow industry members in the Chinese areas of North and South Shanghai requesting an increase in commodity prices, it was decided to make appropriate adjustments to the originally set prices. Many other important cases were discussed, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>To the Editor: Yesterday (the 18th), your newspaper's news column reported that a Guangdong girl was homeless, sobbing by the roadside, and was questioned by a policeman, who learned that the girl was a descendant of a former Qing official, in dire straits, in a very pitiful state. He immediately took her to the First Branch of the Fourth District and sent her to a charity for foster care. We were deeply shocked. Our association has not seen the Fourth District First Branch send the girl to our foster care facility in recent days. We hereby send a letter to clarify. We hope that your newspaper will publish this letter in the "Letters" column to clarify the truth. We are sincerely looking forward to your reply. Sincerely, The Zhabei Zishan Association, May 19th.</p>

<h3 id="e208">The Story of World Literature (1) (5) (6) Written by John Macy, Translated by Hu Zhongchi <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Chapter XVIII: French Poetry of the Nineteenth Century</p>
<p>Chapter XL: The Classical Age of German Literature</p>
<p>Goethe seems to us to have the illusion of deep talent and endowment, and to have the experience and sympathy for human life. These qualities will not only make him a decoration of literature, but also make him stand tall in many ways as "the teacher of life" and the model of his time. This qualification is given to him [Carlyle</p>
<p>In this narrative about literature, we seem to have understood that the habits of thinking and the techniques of writing are somewhat of a continuous process. There are ups and downs, flashes of inexplicable genius, and times of stagnation. Any "era" is actually not an era, because the word era seems to imply a definite beginning and end. In the story of literature, and as far as I have investigated, in any other part of the story of mankind, such a definite time is extremely rare. Events and ideas flow and blend together, so when we talk about the nineteenth century, we do not mean that an idea was born exactly on January 1, 1801. Many of the ideas of the nineteenth century can be traced back to the eighteenth century. The classical age of Germany unfolded almost equally on both sides of 1800. In this summary, we will deliberately not mention the precise dates that anyone can find in the encyclopedia. However, in order not to forget the general location, we can keep in mind that Goethe died in 1832 (the same year Scott died) and that his vigorous era of production spanned the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The pioneers were all in the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>To understand Goethe and his contemporaries, we need to trace back several years and find the things that led to that supreme master and the classical age of German literature. This is necessary.</p>
<p>When the Peace of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years' War in 1648, all the lands using the German language were devastated by the war, and only half of the pre-war population remained. The wars caused by the Reformation and its consequences led to the complete failure of the German artistic renaissance, and the only legacy left by German literature was folk songs. Needless to say, literature did not die out completely during the war. In the decline of civilization, the purpose of scattered writers was to keep a kind of flame burning. Naturally, such writers adopted smooth poetry, maintained the purity of language, and did not aspire to anything more than precision. This was the goal of Martin Opitz, who was considered the German Waller (Note 1) and Malherbe (Note 2) at the time. He adopted the Alexandrine verse, wrote a small essay on German poetry, and in various other ways, intended to adopt the forms and ideals of French literature of the "Great Age" (Note 3). The most original writer of that desolate era was the satirist Logau. Some of his poems are known to English readers through Longfellow's translation. We do not need to dwell on the playwright Gryphius, or on the various local societies that strive to maintain the purity of language and maintain a lively interest in literature.</p>
<p>Note 1: Edmund Waller was an English poet who served as a member of the Long Parliament.</p>
<p>Note 2: See Chapter XIX</p>
<p>Note 3: The era of Louis XIV's reign</p>
<p>During the period from the Thirty Years' War to the Seven Years' War, there were only three noteworthy figures. The catastrophe of the Thirty Years' War was described by Christopher Wangreliomermeshosheng in the thoroughly realistic novel "Simplicissimus". This story, based on the rumors of rogues, is still very readable today. We must also mention Paul Gerhard, the greatest hymn writer in Germany after Luther. Many of his hymns have been translated by John Wesley and others and are familiar everywhere where English is used.</p>
<p>When Leipzig was the capital of German literature in 1740, it was a kind of Mecca where Gottsched was the prophet of Barrow. In order to explain the critical aspect of the works of the great classical masters of German literature, it is necessary to pay attention to the driest, most superficial Gallic style that prevailed. Those works had their vague pioneers in Switzerland. The Swiss critics Bodmer and Breitinger left France and turned to England. They published periodicals imitating the "Spectator," especially refuting the fallacies of France with cold eloquence, and paying attention to the true solemnity of Milton. The Swiss poet Albrecht von Haller, in that poem of the Alps, imitated Thomson's "Seasons," and slightly later, the elegiac poets Salis and Matthisson imitated Gray in their poems. Some of those poems were known to English readers through Longfellow's English translation. At that time, in Germany itself, poetry was limited to imitating France.</p>
<p>Art World Guidelines</p>
<p>(1) The text is limited to news, comments, and introductions about recent art (painting, music, sculpture, architecture, drama, etc.) and literature at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Pictures are limited to recent works by new writers at home and abroad and illustrations related to the text.</p>
<p>(3) Photos are limited to recent portraits and works by writers at home and abroad and various photographs related to the text.</p>
<p>(4) The number of words in each article should not exceed 3,000.</p>
