<h3>日本海約精查會之相持</h3>
<p>日本倫敦海軍協約政府與樞府之間發生衝突互持不下遂有精查會之舉不意精查會中政府與樞府依然不能諒解而又有中止精查會之舉說者謂倫敦海約之命運將决諸日皇之御前會議此事結局如何至今尚在未可知之數唯以日本以前之外交而論則此海約之必將批准斷無疑義日政府對於樞府之不肯稍屈者亦以此也蓋樞府之對此協約所以如此為難者非眞欲破棄此約不過欲使政府屈服而後贊成之耳</p>
<p>於此可以推知此次海約之風潮其原仍在政爭政府敵黨欲利用此機會以推翻政府而政府恃條約之關係以示不屈此皆暗中角逐之策略與海約之本文無甚關係者也要之今日日政府之敵黨其正面攻擊者惟在國中之經濟問題商業不振而失業增加為其最要之一點亦為日政府所無可如何之事若海約之反對不過側面之襲擊而已</p>

<h3>中華遠征足球隊由棉返星</h3>
<p>現有隊伍十六人||待西方來電能揚帆</p>
<p>在棉蘭四戰四勝||李惠堂獨獲十一球</p>
<p>（九月六日新嘉坡通訉）中華遠征足球隊此次遠征來南其最大目的在組織一中華足球遠征隊遠征歐陸此舉已疉見報載讀者諒已洞悉前月二十日該隊自爪哇返星記者曾將所得之消息報告謂（······該隊征歐之舉本定八月二十二日乘英郵前往日昨接倫敦來電囑緩十四日動程蓋次帮之船約九月六日離星也）今日九月六日已屆果能成行者則將拼擋一切乘長風而破萬里浪矣惟該隊前月二十五日又應荷屬棉蘭人士之敦請往棉作四塲之比賽未月二日始可賽畢返星時間與原定動輪往歐時間相距無多據推測所得則該隊定必一行抵星即將出發矣昨日（五日）該隊一行人雖已聯翩返星然仍無動程之意記者特往訪問藉知歐行消息查該隊一行十五人俱寄寓南天三樓共四室記者抵步即至三樓三十三號與該隊領馬余衡之君晤談藉悉彼等往歐事仍須候倫敦方面之來電是以原定數日內乘英輪出發一舉不能如願以償現彼等暫寓南天俟本日（六日）下午中華隊離星返港後彼等即將遷至胡文虎先生巴絲班讓之別墅中居住緣該處地極幽靜最為適合較南天之喧囂不可同日而語至於他日往歐怡保之陳美安君星洲之亞九·亞輝·文禮三君俱將隨征春林君則仍未定奪該隊此次抵星戰將共十三員益以陳美安亞九亞輝文禮三君共十六人仍須物色二三人偕行以壯實力至於此次征荷屬棉蘭成績絕佳計賽四場無一和或敗者</p>
<p>據余君云此次征棉第一場與中華隊戰結果三比二該地荷人大肆稽評以為樂華者徒有其名耳華字報則謂客軍初至讓步一下乃最客氣之舉及至第二次與該地人士公認為比較實力最大且星洲戌軍隊曾與之戰和之蘇東隊激戰結果竟八比一將其擊敗於是荷報大登特登謂前後判若兩隊而第三第四竟如入無人之境敵方俱一無所得而逃矣計四塲共得球十六分而球怪李惠堂君竟獨得十二分其雄威震於蘇東島可想見矣李惠堂君自滬來星至爪舊疾俱未痊愈是以成績平平不但令觀者失望即彼自身想亦抱恨謂之為球怪殊為恰切至蘇島後則奇力復發故有此成績也現該隊在星正在候倫敦之來電已如上述余君謂若有機會當再與星聯隊晤面彊塲若有較長久之時間（大約拾日左右）則擬至馬甲怡保等地一游蓋該隊至馬來亞後徐在星勾留最久外催曾至吉隆埠數日耳記者與余君交談畢乃興辭而別</p>
<h3>在棉蘭四戰四勝</h3>
<p>中華遠征足球隊在棉蘭四戰四勝列表於左</p>
<p>戰期　　　　　敵方　　球勝　　李惠堂得球</p>

<p>九月二日　　　勝巫聯　二比○　二</p>
<h3>二比零勝巫聯詳情</h3>
<p>（九月二日棉蘭通訉）中華遠征足球隊自到棉蘭以後四戰四勝本月一日以三比零大勝荷聯後於二日又以二比零大勝巫聯誌之如下是日戰時塲中之觀衆不减於前尤以馬來人佔過半數華人亦復不少歐西人士次之誠空前所未有之熱鬧也鐘鳴五句由公證人鳴笛集五隊伍地盤擇定之後旋聞一聲銀笛由是而雙方開始火併首先由華隊開球射入巫聯前鋒即被巫聯中鋒阻住盤之而上同時左右翼即遙遙掩護而前衛則又隨後趕至適與華隊之中前鋒及前衛諸將相遇左衛右突爭來奪去為勢甚猛加之巫聯隊方面之各戰將多數為精銳份子同時又是生力軍故此時華隊雖有身輕百職之戴先鋒及曹習將軍諸健兒一時實難取勝</p>
<h3>（一）李惠堂孤掌難鳴</h3>
<p>戰至五時十分李惠堂單騎直入奪得一球之後盤之直上不幸被巫聯隊前衛後衛夾攻而華隊前鋒一時未能趕至遂形孤立無援卒被聯隊中鋒反擊落於華隊被孫思敬遞於左翼陳光耀一脚射去適從巫聯隊門上斜過遂失良機</p>
<p>巫聯隊球門開球之後巫聯隊各路健兒因見華隊爭奪射擊之法厲害迫不得已乃採取游擊衝鋒之法以圖取勝故每見球落華隊時見分曉傾各路之迦而出復用兩路夾擊華隊一將之法雖不能直搗華隊龍門然華隊陣線每因此而發生搖動當戰至五時十五分鐘時巫聯隊又猛射一球直落華隊第二防線時華隊前衛空虛巫聯隊數路健兒又已趕至球向巫聯隊記線落下華聯遂得化險為夷</p>
<h3>（二）周賢言力退雄師</h3>
<p>當李寗解圍後球落於巫聯隊陣中時即被華隊前鋒戴麟經從旁射出即被右翼曹桂成盤至巫聯隊邊陲要地正中巫聯隊球門不幸被巫聯隊守將擊退旋又混戰一場雙方幾次衝鋒巫聯隊畢竟聾子不怕銃橫衝直撞華隊為保全實力計不願作無謂之犧牲迨至五時二十五分誰知球竟初巫聯隊中鋒射擊退而復來幸被張世龍一足擊退惟被巫聯隊又復盤軍捲土重來甚至華隊被其包圍龍門危在旦夕至五時二十七分巫隊竟得一球衝至龍門幸被周鐵門眼明手快拾而反擊於巫聯隊防線中未幾公證人鳴笛休息上場遂成和局</p>
<h3>（三）三進攻未成其功</h3>
<p>五分鐘休息時間過去雙軍之勝負蓋已全待於下半場之三十分鐘內矣初由巫隊中鋒開球傳於前左鋒斜擊與右翼守將盤之而上正遇華隊左翼陳光耀迎頭阻止繼由陳光耀射送中鋒被戴麟經獲得遞過於陳　添卒以巫聯隊各路趕到球被衝散至五時四十一分球怪李惠堂從人馬什踏中閃出接得一球向准巫聯隊龍門射去不幸被其守將接獲似有忍痛之色勉强將球擊退至五時四十五分李惠堂又盤得一球方擬射擊時卒又疲巫聯隊前鋒衝散最後至五時四十六分由曹桂成傳得一球李惠堂盤之而上斬將直入連破兩關至巫聯隊第二防線足起球飛從巫聯隊球門側過從勞無功觀衆搖頭嘆息</p>
<h3>（四）觀者急暗自嘆息</h3>
<p>球怪李惠堂三次猛射巫聯隊球門未能如願後斯時全場之華僑觀衆鑑於巫聯隊雖有勇無謀然實力未可輕視復睹於停戰時間將屆猶不分勝負為同僑體面上中華名譽上及國家光榮上着想莫不憂形於色暗自嘆息同僑愛護中華之誠於斯可見</p>
<p>惟是巫聯隊方面亦鑑於華隊在此五分鐘內尚未能取勝即思大舉反攻謀最後之勝利同時即以球門守將固守大本營後衛兼攻前衛前鋒則盡行開拔於華隊陣地華隊是時乃利用連瑕攻守之法以破聯隊陣勢互相攻奪華隊二次被圍有如水流不洩左方拒出右邊再來多被李寗頭擊退此時之巫聯隊雖用蠻攻但究無如前日荷聯隊之粗魯暴燥暗放冷箭是則巫聯隊較諸荷聯隊終勝一籌</p>
<h3>（五）好運來連獲勝利</h3>
<p>雙方彼此肉搏至六時五分鐘時霹靂一聲而百發百中之李將軍遂一鼓發氣勇往直前以一身經數敵略施其神通之藝術巫聯隊前鋒遂疲於應付未幾由梁榮德傳入一球李惠堂即乘機用半臥射之法匍然一聲球竟從巫聯隊背後飛入其球門內矣同時全場掌聲及祝勝利之爆竹聲有如山崩地裂同僑方面則已轉愁為喜矣旣而復再開戰時聯巫隊方面經此一敗軍心搖動反攻之勇氣亦一落千丈故是時之球勢常在巫聯隊第二防線中雖幾次被衛擊退無如前鋒不應命戰至六時八分鐘（距停戰時間僅有二分鐘）又被華隊陳　添盤得一球轉遞中鋒陣線為李惠堂盤之直向巫聯隊衝破第二防線足起球飛又應聲入網掌聲又復雷動旋佈陣再戰雙方混戰二分鐘之久均無進展遂由公證人鳴笛收隊結果為二與零之比中華又奏凱旋</p>

<h3>藕話</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>公子調冰佳人雪藕夫藕之為物百孔玲瓏絲絲入扣古人稱之為靈根出水良有以也</p>
<p>藕有田藕塘藕之分而塘藕產於吾蘇南塘尤為上品遜清時代常以入貢有所謂傷荷藕者葉味甘為蟲所傷也又梅　北蓮蕩亦以產藕名其甘嫩不减高郵車坊藕鬆脆無比惟皮色麄惡有失觀瞻皮相失天下士不但藕為然也藕以一節者為佳雙節次之三節又次之三角形者孔小肉厚圓筒形者孔大肉薄凡購擇藕段者不可不知</p>
<p>取鑤鑤鮮藕成絲以葛布絞瀝之汁旣澱粉和入糖霜然後以沸水冲之清芬可口勝於市上所售之西湖白蓮藕粉萬倍又以藕片調以麵粉入油煎汆謂之藕餅</p>
<p>藏藕之法須埋陰濕地或以泥裹之則可以經久致遠</p>
<p>藕之詭異名貴者如終南山有旱藕見唐書千常碧藕見拾遺記太華峰頭玉井蓮花開十丈藕如船見韓愈古意長安城南禊池產巨藕曰玉臂龍又北方出三孔藕名省事三俱見清異錄</p>
<p>情意之未絕者世人常以藕繼絲連喻之海上雋流有夏宜滋者嘗取藕絲為印泥印泥一小盎耗藕數十百斤亦藝苑曠聞也</p>
<p>取藕節曝懸檐間越一寒暑可以煎湯服飲凡胸膈悶塞飲之自能開解</p>
<p>藕孔實以糯米蒸之為熟藕更和糜煮之為藕粥洵家廚清品也</p>
<p>楊太眞著鴛鴦並頭蓮錦袴襪三郞戲之曰貴妃袴襪上乃眞鴛鴦蓮花也不然其間安得有此白藕乎太眞因名袴襪為藕復此藕之艷乘也錄之以殿藕話</p>

<h3>糧食　河下米巿平平</h3>
<p>閘北　昨日裡路來源甚微巿銷平正破粳見到一百餘石價開二十元零七角半情勢見隱西新粳高貨不多共到二百石之譜價為二十元零五角東新粳本有轉軟之勢奈因天又轉陰致暫維原盤行情仍為二十元全日粳情甚為平平新羊尖買氣平常來源亦稀價開十四元七八角新客尖車到甚接去路已覺不化大盤十三元五六角白元走銷欠爽行情開十八元八角</p>
<p>滬南　河到凋零走銷不化常帮白粳極枯霖同破粳頂貨開十九元半大勢尚穩新粳已轉盤旋故價似有角外之出入耳南帮薄早稻到銷兩淡巿交極為寥寥羊尖來源陸續新尖走銷尚殷以上大盤一律均無榮辱特別頂貨開十四元關左</p>
<h3>機早米到多價跌</h3>
<p>昨日客秈續有江西機秈裝到機早占居多數而本街胃口略淡客帮辦意更呆統巿祇有烟台帮辦去湖南砶米二百包其他各帮均無問訉故巿形轉軟機早以存到較多行情回小數分其他各米均居平勢全日成交湖南　靖四百包江西機早一千包又機晚三百包又機元三百包除烟台裝湘米二百包外盡係本街辦去云</p>
<h3>洋米尚存小絞三萬包</h3>
<p>巿上浮存洋米早經售買一空即有囤買及米店購存者為數亦微大都自己配客或由零賣售出故南巿及公會上久無洋米價盤之發見茲據米業調查全滬所存洋米除米店及奇零不計外尚有　數小絞米三萬包及其他各色米數千包此貨均係預備平價出售之需現因新米上巿米價逐次下平當局以為此後似無須再為平糶之舉故所存之小絞米三萬包擬日上在巿售脫云</p>
<h3>期麥空頭抵補而回漲</h3>
<p>昨日期麥巿面上下午開盤後各月份又呈騰漲之象因洋麥報價衹小二角左右初盤人心自然見軟惟一般獲利之空頭則正乘此種機會以為時不可失遂大量狂補所以疲滯之局忽轉為俏利推測補空之心理因洋麥雖合划但尚須五兩一開照標準究尚超過不少故遇機抵進或者將來又須再出蓋目下之氣象似又在空頭控制中也結果本月份較前日漲四分十月份漲四分十一月份漲五分十二月份漲七分一二月份漲六分現麥巿面仍見疲落惟廠家見巿値已廉辦胃已動中次貨較前週落一錢左右較本月份初則已近二錢全巿開台兒荘瑤灣海州麥九千餘包由阜豐申大等廠辦去六千餘包云</p>
<h3>粉巿尚難樂觀</h3>
<p>昨日粉巿上下午開盤後各月份已趨盤旋之象因洋麥之報價又小去二角零故初盤開價人心又未大佳遠期較前日收價仍回軟一分左右旋以各行及廠家之空頭抵補頗勁故又回堅迨至下午開盤初以期�因抵空而回升業�</p>
<p>內外之買氣又稍轉俏然以環境已非昔比客家有洋粉為準備廠家則已開始定購洋麥故此後如北銷開禁粉有出路巿面或可轉定否則賣氣正盛尚未易樂觀也結果本月份較前日小二厘半十月份小五厘十一月份小二厘半十二月份大二厘半一月份大五厘二月份未動云</p>
<h3>疋頭　東貨急轉直下</h3>

This morning, Fugou was also firmly occupied by our army and is now advancing on Tongxu. The Second Column crossed the Lu River northwest of Weichuan yesterday. The Third Column, after recovering Xiangcheng, has now crossed Shigou northwest of Xuchang, approaching Heshang Station. The Fourth Column, after recovering Baofeng, has occupied Mi County, more than thirty miles southwest of Zhengzhou, today. This is the only military stronghold between Zhengzhou and Luoyang. Now that it has been occupied by our army, Zhengzhou is no longer a problem. The Fifth Column, after recovering Linru, has successively captured the two territories of Ziyou and Yiyang. Ziyou, formerly Baisha Town, is only thirty-odd miles from Luoyang and is the only gateway to Luoyang. The progress on the Ping-Han Railway is on schedule without error. This is the most difficult and valuable history in military affairs. The Longhai Army, originally an auxiliary force, has now occupied Kaocheng. Shi Yousan's troops have completely crossed the river and are now completely aligned with our army. After our army occupies Kaocheng, it will advance towards Lanfeng and Kaifeng.

<p>Sino-British Jurisdictional Issues</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Stalemate of the Japanese Naval Treaty Scrutiny Committee</h3>
<p>A conflict has arisen between the Japanese government and the Privy Council regarding the London Naval Treaty. They are at loggerheads, leading to the establishment of a Scrutiny Committee. Unexpectedly, the government and the Privy Council are still unable to reach an understanding within the Scrutiny Committee, and there are even calls to suspend the Scrutiny Committee. Some say that the fate of the London Naval Treaty will be decided at the Imperial Conference. The outcome of this matter is still unknown. However, judging from Japan's previous diplomacy, there is no doubt that this naval treaty will be approved. This is also why the Japanese government is unwilling to yield to the Privy Council. The reason why the Privy Council is making things so difficult for this treaty is not because it truly wants to abandon it, but because it wants to force the government to submit before supporting it.</p>
<p>From this, it can be inferred that the origin of this naval treaty storm lies in the political struggle. The government's opposition party wants to use this opportunity to overthrow the government, while the government relies on the treaty to show its intransigence. These are all strategies of secret rivalry and have little to do with the text of the naval treaty itself. In short, the main attack of the Japanese government's opposition party today is on the country's economic problems, with commercial downturn and increased unemployment being the most important points. This is also something that the Japanese government cannot do anything about. Opposition to the naval treaty is merely a side attack.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Two</p>
<h3>The Political Council's Foreign Affairs Group</h3>
<p>Discusses Sino-British Issues</p>
<p>The Boxer Indemnity Case Has Been Decided</p>
<p>The Jurisdictional Case Has Been Handed Over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Review</p>
<p>Nanjing, The Political Council's Foreign Affairs Group met at the Central Party Headquarters at 5:00 PM on the 16th. Hu Hanmin, Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Wang Zhengting, and others attended. First, they discussed the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity issue. Wang Zhengting reported on the results of his recent negotiations with British Ambassador Lampson, saying that the British side has decided to return the entire Boxer Indemnity to China for the construction of the Guangdong-Han Railway. A board of directors will be jointly organized by China and Britain. The number of directors will be two-thirds Chinese and one-third British. A purchasing committee will be established in London with five members, two Chinese and three British. The purchasing method will be determined by bidding, with the final decision-making power still belonging to the board of directors. After discussion by the members, it was deemed feasible and decided to proceed accordingly. Next, they discussed the Sino-British jurisdictional issue. Wang Zhengting reported that the British side's answer stated that the British side would gradually abolish it, with a few points requesting reservation. After discussion by the members, it was deemed unsatisfactory and decided to hand it over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for proper review. It is also heard that our side will formulate a sound method to strive for application without violating the principle of abolishing extraterritoriality. After it is formulated, it will be submitted by Wang Zhengting for consultation with the British ambassador. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<h3>The German Government Decides to Maintain the Status Quo</h3>
<p>The Question of Whether to Stay or Leave Will Be Determined After the New Parliament is Convened</p>
<p>Planning to Form a Mixed Cabinet of Moderate Factions</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 15th: German Chancellor Dr. Brüning is said to have received President Hindenburg's permission for the current government to remain in office temporarily until the new parliament convenes on October 14th. Negotiations are currently underway to form a mixed cabinet of moderate factions, which may include the Social Democrats, but excluding the Nazi Party and the Communist Party. Nazi leader Hitler announced his policy platform on the eve of the election, advocating (1) the abolition of the policy of begging France for favors, (2) the establishment of a strong German army, and (3) the rejection of the Young Plan. The Nazi Party's victory is largely attributed to the announcement of this policy.</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Berlin, 16th: This morning, the cabinet convened to discuss measures to deal with the temporary political situation. It was immediately decided that, in accordance with the current constitution, the government must temporarily maintain its status quo and prepare to submit to the new parliament, which will convene on October 13th, a special financial plan formulated by the president based on Article 48 of the constitution after the dissolution of the previous parliament. At the same time, the Brüning cabinet is making every effort to seek the cooperation of the Social Democratic Party to consolidate its position. Although it is not easy to achieve this, given that both sides are unwilling to allow political ruptures to occur again and are deeply concerned about political and economic stability, they will ultimately cooperate. According to outside reports, some people are negotiating to unite the small parties in the new parliament, such as the farmers, conservatives, and civil rights groups, and promote Sir Westarp as their leader to seize a portion of the power. This new group will be composed of representatives from forty parties. Its strength will be no less than that of the right-wing civil rights party led by Hugenberg.</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Berlin, 15th: According to the latest official report, the new German parliament will have 576 members, the most of any parliament since the end of the European War. This is because Germany uses a system of proportional representation, where the number of members of parliament is proportional to the number of votes cast, with approximately one member of parliament being produced for every 60,000 votes. Therefore, the number of members of parliament varies from session to session. The approximate number of seats for each party this time is as follows: Social Democratic Party 143 (152 in the previous session), National Socialist Party 107 (12 in the previous session), Communist Party 76 (54 in the previous session), Catholic Center Party 68 (61 in the previous session), National Right Party 41 (79 in the previous session), National People's Party 30 (45 in the previous session), Economic Party 23 (same in the previous session), State Party 20 (25 in the previous session), Bavarian National Party 19 (17 in the previous session), and other small parties totaling 49. The new parliament is scheduled to convene on October 13th, the latest date stipulated in the constitution. Because the seats in the parliament hall are insufficient, it is necessary to remove a portion of the gallery and renovate it, which takes time, so the convening had to be postponed. According to the regulations, the German parliament building was originally designed to accommodate 400 seats. After the war, the number of members of parliament gradually increased with the adoption of proportional representation, resulting in a situation where it could not accommodate them. This is also different from the situation in other countries. At present, those who talk about politics naturally focus on the sharp increase in the number of votes for extreme progressives. However, most newspapers solemnly declare that the majority of Germans firmly advocate a policy of peace and goodwill in international affairs and will not allow radical ideas to overthrow the parliamentary system domestically. Therefore, the general opinion is that Chancellor Brüning will immediately try to concentrate the strength of the moderate factions and first seek cooperation with the Social Democratic Party to form a large mixed cabinet. The party's official newspaper (Vorwärts) has also expressed a willingness to resolve disputes and make peace, declaring in its commentary that the time has come for the republican parties to abandon their old grudges and work together to cope with the crisis. The Deutsche Tageszeitung also stated that no matter which party the future cabinet belongs to, it will not lightly make foolish trials and tribulations. Even if the National Socialist Party holds power, it will not dare to take huge risks in diplomacy and endanger past victories. The German nation and the state have a clear understanding. Even if the election results show temporary fanaticism, they will soon calm down and return to their original state. This is the argument of the official newspapers of the left and right wings of the moderate faction, which can be regarded as a representation of the general psychology of the German people, except for extremists, and is sufficient to show that the rumors in other countries about the formation of a joint cabinet of the Communist and National Socialist parties that would endanger foreign policy are not based on a deep understanding of the basic beliefs of the German people.</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Geneva, 15th: All sectors of the League of Nations were surprised by the results of the German election. France was initially very fearful of the rise of the National Socialist Party, but was somewhat relieved by the complete failure of the Conservative Party led by Dr. Treviranus. When a news reporter inquired about the German election with French Foreign Minister Briand, Briand said that he was not in a position to express his opinion, as he feared being seen as interfering in German domestic affairs. However, in terms of German foreign policy, he believed that although the composition of parliament had changed, it would remain the same as before.</p>
<p>Pacific News Agency, Paris, 15th: The Paris newspapers commented on the German election results with great enthusiasm. The evening papers published editorials discussing the impact of the victory of the extreme parties. The victory of the Nazi Party led by Hitler was unexpected and considered strange. The position of Chancellor Brüning was generally considered unstable. If the central parties could reunite, he might be able to remain in office. In short, the victory of the extreme parties will have a great impact on the matters under discussion in Geneva. The Discussion newspaper stated that this election result is not to be feared, as European public opinion, although it has changed, is still fond of peace. The Times stated that Germany will know when it is in a difficult position. A new element has emerged in Berlin politics, and European politicians cannot forget it. As for Germany not being allowed to make mistakes again, the same is true for Europe.</p>
<h3>Records of the League of Nations Parliament</h3>
<p>German Foreign Minister Delivers Important Speech</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Geneva, 15th: The chairman of the League of Nations Parliament announced that there were still fourteen people scheduled to speak on the agenda. In addition to the usual morning session on Tuesday, the general assembly would continue in the afternoon and evening. This was unprecedented in the history of the League of Nations. The French side indicated that Briand had been persuaded by British Foreign Secretary Henderson to agree to submit the European Federal Plan to the Sixth Committee for review. The two had drafted a motion to this effect, which would be submitted to the general assembly tomorrow. All twenty-seven European countries would attend the committee and have the right to vote. When the general assembly continued this morning, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marinkovic spoke, advocating that the European Federal Plan be discussed by a separate specialized committee, opposing the motion submitted by Swiss representative Motta to refer it to the original general committee. Afterwards, Japanese representative Matsunaga spoke, strongly stating that the Japanese government attaches importance to the issue of disarmament and hopes that the London Naval Treaty will be a precursor to a global naval reduction convention. As for the European Federal Plan, Japan has sympathy for this movement and fully believes that its future realization will not harm the interests of countries outside Europe. At the afternoon session, Hungarian representative Count Apponyi first spoke, welcoming the concept of a European Federation, but strongly advocating that economic issues should take precedence and that the cooperation of the United States was necessary to resolve such issues. He then discussed the peace treaty, stating that the day when this matter would be submitted for discussion based on the principles of fairness and equality was not far off. He also stated that war was ultimately not a tool for resolving such issues. At this point, the audience applauded thunderously. Next, Italian representative Michelis spoke, stating that the global agricultural predicament was the root cause of the current industrial decline, so industry could not be revitalized without restoring agriculture. Finally, representatives from two South American countries spoke, stating that the pursuit of world peace should not be limited to Europe alone. It was reported that the Franco-Italian naval preparatory talks had made satisfactory progress due to the mediation of British Foreign Secretary Henderson. It was expected that Italian Foreign Minister Grandi would arrive here from Rome on Wednesday or Thursday to hold direct talks with French Foreign Minister Briand. This evening, British Minister of Trade Graham hosted a press conference, expressing his support for the movement jointly initiated by the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands to establish an international committee to define the meaning of the most-favored-nation clause in the treaties of various countries. He also stated that Britain opposes any preferential tariff system. He then discussed British imperial trade and the future imperial conference. Graham reiterated this statement, but declined to discuss any specific issues within it.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 15th: Italian representative De Michelis stated at the League of Nations conference today that Italy is now willing to ratify the tariff truce convention, which stipulates the continuation of existing trade agreements for one year, with the condition that tariff rates cannot be increased during this period unless absolutely necessary. If an increase is necessary, other countries must be given the opportunity to negotiate before it is implemented. According to a statement made by British Trade Minister Graham at the League of Nations Parliament on the 13th of this month, Britain will ratify this agreement on November 1st of this year and requested that other countries also ratify it at that time so that the signatory countries can meet to determine whether the agreement has been ratified by a majority of countries. It would be regrettable if the number of ratifications was insufficient at that time and the agreement could not be implemented.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 16th: At today's League of Nations Parliament meeting to discuss the general work of the League of Nations, German Foreign Minister Curtius delivered a speech that was heard by all, stating that the League of Nations is an element of German policy and that Germany intends to support the League of Nations with all its strength. He also stated that countries should not harbor the possibility of war in their minds. Today, we not only have the necessity to avoid war, but we must also eliminate the disputes that cause war. The listeners cheered for him.</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Geneva, 16th: When Foreign Minister Curtius attended and spoke at the League of Nations for the first time this morning, the audience cheered enthusiastically, expressing their warm welcome. This proves that the recent rumors in newspapers that the German election had greatly damaged Curtius' prestige at the Geneva Conference were completely untrue. Curtius stated that since Germany joined the League of Nations, although there have been many disappointments, Germany still attaches great importance to the League of Nations. The first goal of our coming here is to permanently eliminate war, but there are many ways to eliminate war. It is better to prevent it than to contain it, as the method of containment is prone to going astray. Therefore, we strongly support the establishment of a judicial committee to specialize in examining the issue of peace guarantees. Curtius then discussed the issue of reducing armaments, stating that although there have been many discussions on this matter, no actual progress has been made. He said that he was very satisfied with the remarks of British Foreign Secretary Henderson. The disarmament conference should be held next year no matter what, and at that time, measures should be taken to reduce armaments at all costs. Curtius then discussed the case of protecting small and weak nations, stating that the League of Nations should not stand idly by, but should strive to improve their current situation. This is why he advocated that this case should be examined by the League of Nations Sixth Political Committee. This issue is not only related to one country or one nation, but its impact is widespread throughout the world. As for the European Federal Plan promoted by French Foreign Minister Briand, Curtius' opinion was that he admired Briand's ambition in expanding this minority of private claims into a formal motion for the general public to consider. Of all countries, Germany is the most concerned about international understanding, because it is located in the center of Europe. Unfortunately, although Germany has strived for international understanding in recent years, it has not been able to achieve complete harmony. In Curtius' view, the European Federal Plan is best considered by a specially formed committee, but this committee should include all European countries, regardless of whether they are members of the League of Nations or not, and regardless of their political and economic organization, they should be allowed to join.</p>
<h3>Japanese Political Situation Remains Grim</h3>
<p>The Privy Council and the Government Hold Conflicting Attitudes</p>
<p>The Fate of the London Treaty Will Be Decided at the Imperial Conference</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Yesterday, the Privy Council's scrutiny committee and the government clashed head-on, causing great tension in all aspects of the political world last night. The Privy Council side declared that major treaties involving national defense limits cannot be taken lightly and adopted a tougher stance. Privy Council Chairman Kuraoka summoned Vice Chairman Hiranuma and two chief secretaries to his private residence in Akasaka Tanocho at 9:15 this morning to discuss countermeasures. Privy Council advisor Eki Chizuru also visited Ito, chairman of the scrutiny committee, at his private residence in Nagatacho at 9:40 this morning to hear about the committee's progress and express his personal opinions before resigning at 11:00. Eki's visit was the same as General Fukuda's, in that he took the initiative to try to break the impasse. However, some rumors claimed that Ito, in preparation for a split with the government at the Imperial Conference, first sought the understanding of advisors Fukuda and Eki, and then needed to seek the understanding of advisors Okada and Ishii. On the government side, a regular cabinet meeting was held at 10:00 this morning. Prime Minister Hamaguchi gave a detailed report on the progress of the scrutiny committee. After discussion, it was unanimously decided that the government should proceed in accordance with its established policy in order to have the treaty ratified. It was also decided that Prime Minister Hamaguchi would be entrusted with all measures to deal with the Privy Council and all other matters. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 p.m. At present, the political situation has not yet seen a glimmer of hope, and the future remains bleak.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: The fate of the London Treaty will be decided at the Imperial Conference. Among the advisors to the Privy Council's plenary session, besides the committee members, there are also considerable supporters of the treaty. If all the cabinet members join these advisors, the government side can obtain a majority of three to reject the scrutiny committee's review. At this time, newly appointed scrutiny committee members will be added.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Regarding the suspension of the scrutiny by the Privy Council committee, the government observed that, in terms of legal interpretation, the Privy Council cannot simply rely on the committee's report to answer with a "cannot review" response. It is also customary for the committee to reach a unanimous agreement. The committee must first persuade both Mizumachi and Ta. Moreover, it is even more difficult to reach a consensus on the "cannot review" opinion at the Privy Council's formal meeting. A review of the 23 advisors from various factions at the formal meeting, excluding Marquis Kuki Ryuichi, Viscount Ishiguro Tadanori, and Ishihara Kenzo, who were absent due to illness, and Chamberlain Suzuki, who was absent to avoid suspicion, reveals that those who support the treaty among the remaining advisors include Kesaroku Mizumachi, Ryohei Okada, Kikujiro Ishii, Eki Chizuru, Yataro Fukuda, and Kenjiro Tagawa. In addition, Masaakira Tomii, Teiji Sakurai, Kowi Furuichi, and Itaru Matsumuro may not be willing to support the "cannot review" resolution. If a majority vote is contested, the government has 13 ministers and 4 supporting advisors, already obtaining a majority and ensuring a government victory. If the "cannot review" resolution is rejected at the Privy Council's formal meeting, Chairman Kuraoka of the Privy Council, Chairman Ito of the committee, and the other committee members will not be able to remain in their positions with composure due to public perception. Therefore, Chairman Kuraoka and Chairman Ito will carefully consider the committee's decision before the committee meeting is held on the 17th, and</p>

<p>first reach a compromise plan to try to break the impasse.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: The leaders of the Constitutional Democratic Party met at the Marunouchi Industrial Club today to discuss the Privy Council issue and related financial and political issues. They all agreed that the government is not in an unfavorable position in the current situation and decided to fully trust Prime Minister Hamaguchi to monitor the development of the situation. The younger generation of the party's antipathy towards the Privy Council remains strong, and there is a tendency to impeach the Privy Council.</p>

On August 24th, the Turkish government replied that Turkey's military action in Mount Ararat was a legitimate self-defense plan.</p>
<h3>London to Hold a Large Car Exhibition</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th: The world's largest car exhibition will be held in London next month. British car manufacturers are now actively promoting their cars on display in order to occupy a larger position in the global car market.

<h3>Turkish Government Prepares Two Proposals</h3>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Ankara, 15th: The Turkish government will submit a proposal for universal suffrage to all people of the country at the special session of the parliament. It will also submit a proposal to allow the establishment of new political parties with republican and democratic characteristics in the country, so that the Freedom Party to be organized can be formally established according to law. It is expected that both proposals will be passed quickly.</p>
<h3>Dutch Parliament's Autumn Regular Session</h3>
<p>Reuters, The Hague, 16th: The Queen of the Netherlands attended the Autumn Regular Session of the Parliament this morning. Her speech stated that although the situation has sufficient reasons to be satisfactory, it cannot be said to be completely good. The global economic crisis has had a major impact on the industries of the Netherlands and its overseas territories. Therefore, economic reform is the most important task today. This measure should be taken in sincere cooperation with various countries and in harmonious international relations. In the current situation, it is impossible to increase taxes, and the increase in expenditures continues unabated. Therefore, it is necessary to strictly economize. The Dutch East Indies has been feeling the pinch due to a sharp decline in tax revenue. It is now necessary to carefully balance the budget of the Dutch East Indies and consider the fundamental prosperity of the people, and the development of political relations in the Dutch East Indies still needs to be paid attention to.</p>
<h3>Polish Authorities Cover Up Riot Case</h3>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Warsaw, 15th: The authorities are trying to cover up the bloody riots in the capital and</p>
<p>Various provinces on Sunday. The opposition newspapers have been banned from publishing, so the actual number of dead and wounded is unknown. According to the government's official newspaper, only three people were killed and one hundred injured, and two hundred were arrested. According to unverified rumors, twenty people were killed and hundreds injured, and more than five hundred were arrested, including several prominent opposition politicians. The police are now equipped with tear gas bombs to prevent accidents.</p>

<h3>The Communist Bandits' Second Attempt to Invade Changsha Fails</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The communist bandits Zhu Mao, Peng Huang, etc., launched a full-scale invasion of Changsha on the evening of the 30th of last month, fighting fiercely for five days and nights until they were routed on the 4th of this month. Because the National Army held firm and waited for reinforcements, they did not pursue, so the bandit troops still occupied villages in the suburbs 30 to 40 li away. On the evening of the 10th of this month, Peng Huang, Zhu Mao, etc., again divided into four routes to invade Changsha, with Peng Dehuai's troops as the vanguard, launching a fierce attack on the positions of the National Army's right wing, including Ami Ridge, Yuhua Pavilion, Lannichong, Yangjiashan, Erlipai, Guitang, and Wujiaping. Peng Dehuai personally supervised the battle on the front line of Tiao Majian. The National Army defending the positions were the 16th Division of Peng Weiren and the New 5th Division of Gong Bingfan. The bandit army used fire oxen and big knife teams to advance in an attempt to destroy the power grid, followed by spear teams preparing for hand-to-hand combat, and then by rifle soldiers. Peng and Gong's divisions resisted with all their might, and for a time the sound of artillery was deafening and bullets rained down, with the fiercest fighting taking place around Yangjiashan and Ami Ridge. The communist bandits charged many times but were repelled. Because the power grid in front of the fortress had been increased to three layers, although the bandits charged fiercely and engaged in hand-to-hand combat, no one was able to break through the three layers. By 6:00 a.m. on the 11th, more than a thousand bandits had been killed and the bandit forces were unable to withstand the attack and retreated from the positions. The National Army still held its original positions and did not pursue. At dawn, it was seen that 600 to 700 people had been electrocuted and killed outside the power grid, and they were taken away by the Changsha County burial team for burial. At 8:00 a.m. on the 11th, He Jian personally went to Yangjiashan and Ami Ridge on horseback to inspect and comfort the officers and soldiers. As he was speaking to Peng's division, a crowd of bandits swarmed from the opposite mountain, Xiucai Slope, and attacked Yangjiashan. He Jian immediately personally supervised the battle and directed the artillery company to fire more than 20 shells. Airplanes also arrived in time and dropped more than 20 heavy bombs, killing hundreds of bandits. The bandits then retreated to the rear of the mountain. He Jian returned to the province on horseback at 1:00 p.m. Afterwards, the burial team found a paper order issued by Peng Dehuai on September 10 on the bodies of the dead bandits, stating that they would temporarily abandon the left wing and concentrate all their forces on the right wing to seize Changsha within three days from the evening of the 10th. Therefore, He Jian transferred Luo Lin's division, which was responsible for the left wing, to the right wing on the evening of the 11th to meet the enemy with strong forces, and waited in strict formation on the evenings of the 11th and 12th for the bandits to attack. However, the bandits did not attack for several days, presumably having fled far away. The victory reports of Peng and Gong's division commanders and Regiment Commander Liu are recorded below:</p>
<p>Report from Division Commander Peng Weiren: At about 9:00 p.m. on the 10th, more than 2,000 bandit troops advanced from the Dongshan area and attacked the positions of Regiment Commander Liu Jiren's 95th Regiment in the Ami Ridge area. When the bandits were 200 meters away from our positions, they used pine tree cannons to fire fiercely at Liu's troops. Regiment Commander Liu knew that they were earth cannons and remained hidden. It was not until the bandits were close that he realized that the bandits were attacking in four layers. The first layer was a big knife and axe team hoping to break through our power grid. The second layer was a spear team preparing to fight us hand-to-hand. The third layer was a machine gun and pistol team. The fourth layer was a rifle team. From 9:00 p.m. to dawn on the 11th, they charged our positions four or five times, advancing wave after wave with extreme intensity. Liu then used machine guns, bombs, and hand grenades to sweep the area, and the bandits were unable to withstand the attack and began to flee to the mountainous area in front of the Ami Ridge positions. Many bandits were killed in this battle, the number of which is countless, and several enemy flags were captured. One platoon leader and dozens of soldiers were also injured in our army. Report from Division Commander Gong Bingfan: (1) According to a report from Regiment Commander Yang Sizhong of the 20th Regiment, at 11:30 p.m. on the 10th, about 2,000 to 3,000 bandits used three machine guns to cover their advance to within dozens of meters of our positions in Wujiaping and attacked our Ami Ridge. After several hours of fierce fighting, more than 500 bandits were killed. The bandits were repelled at dawn on the 11th and Wujiaping was recovered. The bandits fled in a southeasterly direction. (2) According to a report from Regiment Commander Liu Zhenhan of the 17th Regiment, on the evening of the 10th, about 2,000 to 3,000 communist bandits attacked the Yangjiashan area. He led the 3rd Battalion to Yangjiashan to prepare for support. After careful investigation, our positions were heavily guarded and the bandits were unable to succeed. It was reported that the bandits moved to the Shiyanpu and Xujiaqiao areas.</p>
<p>Report from Regiment Commander Liu Jiren: At about 10:00 p.m. last night, the 10th, the communist bandits Zhu Mao and Peng Huang took advantage of the wind and rain to lead more than 10,000 of their main forces to attack our regiment's positions in Liujia Chong, Liangtui Chong, and Guitang. I immediately ordered the entire line to calmly meet the attack. Soon, the sound of the bandits' guns became louder and closer, and they attacked us fiercely. We also used machine guns to sweep the area. The bandits ignored everything and charged forward despite the bullets. At that time, the wind and rain were raging, not only could the sound of conversation not be heard, but one could not even distinguish one's fingers. Our officers and soldiers only used their hearing to measure the location of the bandits' gunshots and fired fiercely. Unexpectedly, the bandits were extremely cunning. All kinds of machine guns, submachine guns, and Mauser pistols were firing fiercely at us from about 100 meters in front of our positions. At the same time, a sabotage team armed with spears, sickles, and axes had crawled to our first iron fence, first throwing lime to try to obscure the vision of our soldiers. Then, the sound of knives, axes, and iron wire was heard. Our officers and soldiers immediately fired fiercely with machine guns, Mauser pistols, and submachine guns, and bombarded them with hand grenades. The bandits fled backwards, but returned again soon after, and were still repelled by us. They charged our iron fence more than ten times in this way, but never succeeded. Finally, Peng Huang and Zhu Mao personally led a pistol team and a machine gun company to attack our entire line fiercely. Bullets rained down and the firepower was extremely fierce. In a few minutes, several officers and more than a dozen soldiers in our regiment were injured. However, our morale was very high and we still fired calmly and fiercely at the bandits. Before long, the bandit troops charged forward towards us, and the sound of their shouts and the sound of gunfire were like a raging wind and angry tide. Our officers and soldiers used their superior fortifications to strike a heavy blow head-on, and their morale became stronger and stronger as they fought. The bandits finally collapsed and fled at dawn. In this battle, we killed more than 1,000 communist bandits, and the number of wounded was equal. In addition, about 300 people were drowned in the ponds of Liujia Chong and Liangtui Chong. Zhu Mao and Peng Huang suffered such a heavy loss that they were powerless to do anything.

<h3>Gan Army Blocks Zhu Mao on the Hunan Border</h3>
<p>Dai Yue's Brigade Defends on the Hunan-Jiangxi Border</p>
<p>Deng Ying's Division Destroys the Gujiang Bandit Nest</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Regarding the joint suppression of Zhu Mao and Peng Huang by the three provinces, the current focus is entirely on Hunan, with Jiangxi and Hubei playing an assisting role. Chief Commander Lu previously sent Jia Botao, the liaison officer of the 9th Route Army stationed in Jiangxi by the Wuhan Branch of the Executive Yuan, to Wuhan to consult with Director He on the specific plan for the joint suppression of the three provinces and report on everything. Jia has completed his mission and returned to Jiangxi to report to Lu. It is slightly heard that the joint suppression of the three provinces will still be carried out in accordance with the outline issued by Director He, and detailed methods will be drafted by each province and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. Chief Commander Lu is currently issuing orders to all counties in accordance with the outline for suppressing bandits in the three provinces, ordering them to establish defense groups, strictly implement rural cleansing, build blockhouses, and purchase guns for self-defense by the end of September, and to draft specific methods based on local conditions for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>Since the communist bandits of Zhu Mao and Peng Huang were repelled by the 4th Route Army and the Gonglu and other divisions in Changsha, the bandits have shown signs of fleeing from Liuyang and Liling towards the Jiangxi border. Border defense in Hunan and Jiangxi has become even more tense. Currently, Dai Yue's 52nd Brigade of the 18th Division is stationed in Wanzai to block and suppress the bandits from Liuyang. The 53rd and 54th Brigades have a part stationed in Shanggao and Pingxiang to intercept the bandits from Liling. The above units are setting up defenses step by step on the Hunan-Jiangxi border, waiting in strict formation. If the bandits attack, they will strike a heavy blow head-on. If necessary, they will advance from Pingxiang towards Liling and Zhuzhou to join the 4th Route Army. Liuyang has deep mountains and forests, and most of the people have been transformed into bandits, making it difficult to march. The Provincial Party Department previously sent a letter requesting Chief Commander Lu to suppress the bandits in Tonggu, Leping, and Yudu counties. Lu replied in a telegram: (The bandits are rampant, which is deeply regrettable. According to reports from various parties, I have ordered Ma's brigade to send troops to recover Yudu, and parts of the 18th Division and the 50th Division to suppress Leping, Jingzhen, and other places. Regarding the communist bandits in Tonggu, Brigade Commander Dai Yue has led a large army to station in Wanzai. Once the main force of Zhu Mao is annihilated, troops will be divided to suppress them severely.) and so on.</p>
<p>It can be seen that the province is currently concentrating its forces to deal with Zhu Mao.</p>
<p>Western Jiangxi has always been a den of communist bandits. While the main force is advancing to suppress Zhu Mao, the Red Army's pseudo-20th Army and pseudo-22nd Army have repeatedly laid siege to Ganzhou and Ji'an in an attempt to seize those two places and open up southern Jiangxi and western Jiangxi to respond to Zhu Mao. On the 4th of this month, the Red Army's independent regiment and the 123rd regiment joined forces with more than 10,000 peasant bandits from Anfu and Yongxin counties, armed with thousands of guns, and attacked the Zhenjun Mountain area near Jicheng with their main force. Division Commander Deng personally led his troops to fight. Regiment Commander Wang and Battalion Commander Hu also led their troops to charge bravely. In addition, the Luoshan police team launched a flank attack on the bandits' rear, and the bandits' line was thrown into chaos. Division Commander Deng took advantage of the victory to charge into the bandits' formation, killing 300 to 400 bandits. The bandits' regiment commander, Hu Xuejun, was also shot and killed. The remaining bandits scattered. Previously, the communist bandits launched a full-scale attack, and Division Commander Deng secretly ordered the security teams of Taihe, Xingguo, and Ji'an counties to attack the Gujiang bandit nest (located between Ji'an and Anfu, which has been occupied by the communist bandits since 1927). The bandits were caught off guard and were defeated by the security teams of various counties, suffering heavy casualties. The communist bandits' so-called wounded soldiers' government, Red Army school, and banks were all destroyed. The communist bandits are now in a dilemma. The communist bandits of the pseudo-22nd Army in southern Jiangxi have also been severely damaged by Ma's brigade and the security teams of various counties in Xinfeng and Yudu. Xinfeng has already been recovered, and Yudu will also fall soon. As for Fang Zhimin, the communist bandit who fled from eastern Jiangxi and disturbed Hukou and Duchang in northern Jiangxi, he has been defeated by the security regiment of Zhang Chao, the 1st and 2nd special task regiments of Wen Sen, and the 297th regiment of Yue Sen, and has retreated to the Duchang and Dexing areas.

<h3>Hunan People Expand the Communist Eradication Movement</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The communist bandits Zhu Mao and Peng Huang are currently retreating to the Jiumu, Daba Bridge, Jintuo, Luzhi Ridge, Tiao Majian, Tongjingpu, Datopu, Bantangchong, and Tianji Ridge areas 30 to 40 li away from Changsha, building fortifications and plotting a counterattack. Because the 4th Route Army and the Luo Lin and Gong Bingfan divisions must wait for the Gan army to concentrate on the Hunan border and the central government to send additional units to the Changsha-Yueyang area before launching another attack, they are currently holding the key fortresses in the suburbs of Changsha to consolidate the provincial defenses.

<h3>Yan Xishan Goes to the Jinpu Railway to Comfort the Troops</h3>
<p>His whereabouts are secretive and heavily guarded</p>
<p>Met an airplane on the way, but fortunately it did not drop bombs</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since the outbreak of the military conflict, Yan Xishan has twice gone to the Jinpu Railway to command military affairs. The routes he took were different each time to avoid the central government's airplanes and bombs. On the afternoon of the 10th of this month, Yan Xishan prepared to go to the Jinpu Railway again. The Hebei area of ​​this city was placed under martial law early on the afternoon of that day at 6:00 p.m. At 4:00 p.m. that afternoon, Yan ordered the preparation of a special train. Xie Zongzhou, director of the Pinghan Railway Bureau, immediately prepared the train and parked it at the Dong Station in front of the gate. At 6:30 p.m., Yan ordered the train to return to Shijiazhuang, and Xie transferred the special train to the West Station. However, those with a little common sense of the current situation did not believe that he would return to Shijiazhuang. At 7:30 p.m., Kang Juyou, the battalion commander of the 1st Battalion of Yan's guard brigade, led the entire battalion of armed soldiers to board the train. It was originally intended to have a pilot train go ahead, but due to a lack of locomotives, it was merged with the special train, totaling 34 cars. At 8:00 p.m., soldiers, police, and military police arrived one after another and were heavily guarded, driving away idlers inside and outside the station. Even the duty officers and staff of the railway bureau had to wear uniforms, otherwise they were not allowed to wander on the platform. At 9:00 p.m., Yan went to Wang Jingwei's residence at No. 3 Hutong, Dongsi Pailou, to say goodbye. At 10:00 p.m., he returned to his residence to rest and drove his own red car No. 1 and No. 10 to the special train, with Chu Xichun, commander of the Beijing Garrison, and Wang Xifu, director of the Public Security Bureau, escorting him. At 11:00 p.m., Wang Jingwei, Tan Zhen, Xie Chi, Zhao Pilian, Zou Lu, and Ji Gongquan gathered again at No. 7 Hutong, Dongsi</p>

<h3>Summary of Important News</h3>
<p>Pailou to see Yan off. Yan said that he was about to leave for the south to comfort the soldiers at the front, and asked Wang and Xie to be temporarily responsible for all party and government affairs. At 12:00 a.m., Wang and others left, and Yan prepared to depart. At this time, police were densely deployed on the roads from his private residence to Qianmen. Zhao Daiwen, Gu Renfa, Xie Zongzhou, and others boarded the train one after another. At 12:35 a.m., Yan arrived at the West Station, wearing a white summer cloth long shirt. A reporter asked Yan where he was going, and he replied that he could not say for sure. He was also asked whether Jia Jingde and Xue Dubi had reported to Beijing after contacting Zhang Xueliang in Shenyang, and he replied that no telegram had arrived in Beijing. He was asked when he would return to Beijing, and he replied that it would be in the near future. At 12:40 a.m., the special train departed. At 1:30 a.m., it arrived at Changxindian, and after the locomotive was watered, it turned into a branch road. At 6:00 a.m., it arrived in Tianjin. Yuan Qingzeng, commander of the Tianjin Garrison, and Zeng Yanyi, director of the Public Security Bureau, both came to the station to take care of the situation and temporarily mobilized security teams, pistol teams, broadsword teams, bicycle teams, and station military police to be on guard. The special train did not enter the station, and the locomotives were immediately changed. Liu Encheng, director of the Jinpu Railway Bureau, followed the train south. At 9:40 a.m., it arrived in Cangzhou, and the locomotive was watered. At 10:00 a.m., it drove south. At 1:20 p.m., it arrived in Dezhou. At 8:20 a.m. on the 10th, five red-tailed, white-winged airplanes were spotted circling over Yucheng for a week and dropped four bombs, all of which landed in open areas and caused no damage. The airplanes then returned south along the Jinpu Railway. At 10:40 a.m., another airplane was spotted over Cangzhou. The plane was very small and seemed to be a reconnaissance plane. At that time, Yan's special train was only 30 minutes away from Cangzhou and was spotted by the airplane. However, it was mistaken for a pilot train and continued to fly north for reconnaissance. When it reached Machang and did not see a train, it determined that Yan was on the first train and returned to Jinan to report, wanting to send bomber planes north again. Time was running out and Yan planned to get off the train in Pingyuan, but encountered the airplane on the way and got off the train in Dezhou instead, and his whereabouts are unknown. Zhang Yinwu heard in Yucheng that Yan had gotten off the train in Dezhou and took a special train to Dezhou to transfer to a car and chase after him. Based on this situation, it is speculated that Yan is in the vicinity of Dezhou. (September 12)</p>
<h3>Duan Heng's Brigade Recovers Qiyang</h3>
<p>Tang Shengming's Remnants Flee to Yongzhou</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Tang Shengming, Li Zemin, Yan Renyi, Feng Tiangui, Wang Zuo, and other remnants of the Gui clique took advantage of the fact that the main force of the 4th Route Army was concentrated in Changsha to suppress the bandits and the south of Hunan was empty to successively seize Dong'an, Lingling, Qiyang, and other counties and invade Hengbao. He Jian ordered Duan Heng, the brigade commander of the 19th Division and commander of the Hunan Garrison, to lead his two regiments, Yu Gongqian and Chen Hanxiong, from Hengzhou along the Quanhu River to Qiyang to suppress the bandits, and ordered Luo Fanying, the division commander of the 16th Division (note that Luo has now been removed from his post and Peng Weiren has been promoted to division commander, but Luo has not yet handed over his duties and is still stationed in Baoqing), to sit in Baoqing, and to lead Luo's two regiments, Zhang Liangji and He Jingcheng, from Baoqing to Qiyang to attack. On the 7th, Duan's troops had reached Quanhu, and Luo's troops had reached Daying City, launching attacks simultaneously. After a day and night of fierce fighting, Battalion Commander Wang of Chen's regiment bravely charged into the positions of Tang Shengming's troops and killed the pseudo-brigade commander Chen Dunhe. The enemy's line wavered and retreated to Qiyang County. On the evening of the 8th, Chen's troops successively recovered Quanhu, Gaoling, and other places. At the same time, He Jingcheng's regiment also occupied Wenming City and Daying City on the 8th and killed an enemy regiment commander, Tang Shenghan. The enemy's entire line wavered and they abandoned Qiyang on the 9th and fled to Yongzhou and Dong'an. Chen Hanxiong's regiment of Duan Heng's troops then recovered Qiyang County on the 10th, and County Magistrate Tang Qiufan entered the city with the army on the same day to handle the aftermath. However, when the enemy troops withdrew from Qiyang, they looted the middle-class families, and none were spared. Brigade Commander Duan immediately entered Qiyang County on the 11th to plan the pursuit. Hengbao has turned from danger to safety. The people of Hengyang specially prepared wine, meat, incense, tobacco, and southern goods in the name of the Chamber of Commerce to send to the front line to comfort the officers and soldiers. After the recovery of Qiyang, it was heard that Brigade Commander Duan decided to divide into two routes to pursue: (1) Chen Hanxiong, Yu Gongqian, and other units will advance along the main road from Qiyang to Yongzhou. (2) Zhang Liangji, He Jingcheng, and other units will flank Yongzhou from Qiyang via Dong'an. Currently, each unit is advancing towards Yongzhou. (September 13)</p>

<p>Hunan Refugees Passing Through:  Late one evening in front of Chaoyang Gate, more than three hundred male and female refugees from Hunan Province arrived. From among the refugees, Li and two others were chosen to request assistance from the county government. Upon learning of this, the Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched police to suppress them. That night, the refugees temporarily stayed in a temple.

<p>Rice Merchants Using Counterfeit Money: With the new grain harvest season approaching, rice merchants in this county, in order to compete for business, have made it a habit for years to send their staff with foreign currency to search for rice boats in the waterways at midnight. Around 3 a.m. yesterday morning, the Jixin Rice Shop outside Xiaoxi Gate sent its staff to Suzhou Tang to purchase a boatload of unpolished rice from Zhou Jingfu, a farmer from the countryside. At the time, they paid a deposit of ten yuan in Guangdong Bank exchange notes. They then instructed the farmer to send the rice to the shop, where it would be inspected before the final payment was made. Zhou took the deposit and sent the rice to the shop. By the time the rice was inspected, it was already dawn. Zhou, because the shop staff was too busy to settle the account, took the money to the market to buy goods. Someone noticed that the money was counterfeit and called the local police, who took Zhou to the public security police station. Zhou stated that the money came from the Jixin Rice Shop. The police went to the shop to investigate, which was confirmed. The shop owner, Zhu Pinxiang, was brought to the station, along with the farmer and the ten yuan in counterfeit money, and sent to the Ma Lu Public Security Bureau.  The inspector, Su Xishan, interrogated them. Zhu Pinxiang stated that someone had come to the rice merchants' guild a few days ago offering to sell these banknotes for four yuan per hundred.  He had purchased them to use for counting purposes and denied intending to use them as currency, adding that many merchants had bought them.  Inspector Su, according to the statement, wondered what the rice merchants intended by buying such a large quantity of counterfeit money. He immediately sent a letter to the rice merchants' guild to inquire. The farmer was released as he was not involved. Zhu was temporarily released on bail by Xiang Daosheng, a staff member of the Zhangtai Rice Shop.  Because the Rice Merchants' Guild has not yet provided a truthful response, the Ma Lu Public Security Sub-bureau submitted the case file to the main bureau on the 16th for a thorough investigation.</p>

<h3>Yunnan Donglu University to be Changed to Provincial Status</h3>
<p>Yunnan Private Donglu University was founded by Tang Jiyao. The name Donglu was based on the alias that Tang held which meant "East Mainland master", and so he honored himself. The school was established in the 12th year of the Republic of China. The school site was rebuilt and merged with the provincial Jia Grade Industrial School. Departments such as literature, civil engineering, mining, and metallurgy were established. The curriculum was based on the availability of teachers, so many courses were incomplete and rudimentary. Tang Jiyao was responsible for raising funds, and there was no dedicated fund. In the early days of its establishment, the funds were still sufficient, but after Tang's death, fundraising became extremely difficult. The person in charge, a Dong who was Tang's brother-in-law, had no ability to raise funds and was also inconvenient to request to be changed to provincial status, so it was almost impossible to maintain. It was found that the school had not applied for registration and had not complied with the Ministry regulations. Now the Ministry of Education is actively cracking down on private universities and reorganizing provincial universities. It has telegraphed the Yunnan Education Department to present and verify the nature of Donglu University. According to the Yunnan Education Department's telegram yesterday, "Having received the order, we immediately submitted it to the provincial government for discussion and decided to reorganize the private Donglu University into Yunnan Provincial University, which will be implemented in the next semester." This means that the school has been decided by the provincial government to be changed to a provincial university.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Urges Dispatch of Funds for Beiyang Institute of Technology</h3>

The Ministry of Education telegraphed to comfort him. According to a telegram from the president in Tianjin, "Minister Jiang, I respectfully acknowledge receipt of the telegram. I am greatly relieved to hear that the meeting on the 9th approved 20,000 yuan. Although the lights and water have been cut off, I will still comply with the order to maintain operations. Please telegraph the funds as soon as possible to alleviate the urgent need." It is heard that the Ministry of Education has urged the Ministry of Finance to dispatch the funds to provide relief.</p>

<h3>Chinese Expedition Football Team Returns to Singapore from Medan</h3>
<p>Sixteen players currently in the team || Awaiting telegrams from the West before setting sail</p>
<p>Four wins out of four in Medan || Li Huitang scores eleven goals alone</p>
<p>(Singapore Dispatch, September 6) The main purpose of the Chinese expedition football team's trip to Southeast Asia is to organize a Chinese football expedition team to tour Europe. This has been reported in the newspapers, and readers should already be aware. On August 20, when the team returned to Singapore from Java, the reporter reported the news obtained, saying: "(...) The team's trip to Europe was originally scheduled for August 22 by British mail, but yesterday a telegram came from London instructing them to postpone the departure by fourteen days, because the ship of the next group is scheduled to leave Singapore on September 6." Today, September 6, has arrived. If it can be done, they will overcome all obstacles and ride the long winds and break the waves of thousands of miles! However, on August 25, the team also accepted the invitation of people from Medan in the Dutch East Indies to play four matches in Medan, and they could only finish the competition and return to Singapore on the second of the month. The time difference from the original scheduled departure date for Europe is not much. According to speculation, the team will definitely arrive in Singapore and then depart. Yesterday (5th), although the team had already returned to Singapore, there was still no intention of leaving. The reporter made a special visit to inquire about the news of the European trip. It was found that the team of fifteen people were all staying on the third floor of the South Heaven Hotel, in a total of four rooms. The reporter arrived and went to Room 33 on the third floor to meet Mr. Ma Yuheng, the team leader, and learned that their trip to Europe still had to wait for a telegram from London, so the original plan to depart on a British ship in the next few days could not be fulfilled. They are currently staying at the South Heaven Hotel temporarily. After the Chinese team leaves Singapore to return to Hong Kong this afternoon (6th), they will move to Mr. Hu Wenhu's villa in Pasir Panjang to live. The area there is extremely quiet, which is most suitable, and cannot be compared with the noisy South Heaven. As for the future trip to Europe, Mr. Chen Mei'an from Ipoh and Mr. Ya Jiu, Ya Hui, and Wen Li from Singapore will all accompany them. Mr. Chunlin has not yet been decided. The team currently has a total of thirteen warriors in Singapore, plus Chen Meian, Ya Jiu, Ya Hui, and Wen Li, totaling sixteen people. They still need to find two or three more people to join them to strengthen their strength. As for the results of this trip to Medan in the Dutch East Indies, they were excellent. They played four matches and did not draw or lose any of them.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Yu, in the first match in Medan, the result of the match against the Chinese team was three to two. The Dutch people there made a great criticism, thinking that Lehua was only famous in name. The Chinese newspapers said that the visiting team gave way a bit at first, which was the most polite thing to do. By the second time, they fought fiercely with the Sudong team, which was recognized by the local people as the strongest team and had drawn with the Singapore Army team, and they defeated them with eight to one. As a result, the Dutch newspapers reported it widely, saying that the team was completely different from before, and the third and fourth matches were like entering an uninhabited area, and the opponents all fled without gaining anything. In the four matches, they scored a total of sixteen points, and the "ball monster" Mr. Li Huitang alone scored twelve points. His power shook Sudong Island, which can be imagined! Mr. Li Huitang's old illnesses from Shanghai to Singapore to Java had not yet healed, so his performance was mediocre. Not only did it disappoint the audience, but he himself also regretted it. Calling him a "ball monster" is very appropriate. After arriving on Sudong Island, his strange power recovered, so he had this achievement. The team is currently waiting for a telegram from London in Singapore, as mentioned above. Mr. Yu said that if there is an opportunity, they will meet with the Singapore United team again and play a strong match. If there is a longer time (about ten days), they plan to travel to places such as Malacca and Ipoh, because the team stayed in Singapore the longest after arriving in Malaya, and only went to Kuala Lumpur for a few days. After the reporter finished talking with Mr. Yu, he said goodbye and left.</p>
<h3>Four Wins Out of Four in Medan</h3>
<p>The Chinese Expedition Football Team's four wins out of four in Medan are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Date     Opponent     Score     Goals Scored by Li Huitang</p>
<p>August 27     Wins Chinese     3 to 2     2</p>
<p>August 29     Wins Sudong     8 to 1     6</p>
<p>September 1     Wins Dutch League     3 to 0     1</p>
<p>September 2     Wins Wu League     2 to 0     2</p>
<h3>Detailed Account of the 2-0 Victory over Wu League</h3>
<p>(Medan Dispatch, September 2) After the Chinese Expedition Football Team arrived in Medan, they won four consecutive victories. After defeating the Dutch League 3-0 on the 1st of this month, they defeated the Wu League 2-0 on the 2nd. The details are as follows: The audience in the stadium on the day of the match was no less than before, especially Malays, accounting for more than half. There were also many Chinese, followed by Europeans and Westerners. It was an unprecedentedly lively scene. At the sound of the bell at five o'clock, the notary blew the whistle to gather the five teams. After the site was selected, a silver whistle was heard, and the two sides began to fight. First, the Chinese team kicked off, but the Wu League's forwards were blocked by the Wu League's center forward, who dribbled the ball up. At the same time, the left and right wings provided remote cover, and the midfielders also rushed to meet the Chinese team's center forwards and midfielders. The left and right guards rushed to grab and seize the ball. The momentum was very fierce. In addition, most of the Wu League's warriors were elite and were also new forces, so at this time, although the Chinese team had the nimble pioneer Dai and the brave General Cao, it was difficult to win for a while.</p>
<h3>(I) Li Huitang's Futile Efforts</h3>
<p>At 5:10, Li Huitang rode alone, seized a ball, and dribbled it up. Unfortunately, he was besieged by the Wu League's forwards and defenders, and the Chinese team's forwards could not rush to him in time, so he was isolated and helpless. He was eventually counterattacked by the League's center forward. The ball fell to the Chinese team. Sun Sijing passed it to the left wing, and Chen Guangyao shot it with one foot, but it passed diagonally over the Wu League's goal, so he missed a good opportunity.</p>
<p>After the Wu League's goal kick, the Wu League's warriors, seeing the Chinese team's fierce grabbing and shooting methods, had no choice but to adopt guerrilla tactics to try to win. Therefore, whenever the ball fell to the Chinese team, they would rush out from all directions and use two-way attacks to attack one of the Chinese team's generals. Although they could not penetrate the Chinese team's goal, the Chinese team's line often shook because of this. When the battle reached 5:15, the Wu League fiercely shot another ball, which fell to the Chinese team's second line of defense. At this time, the Chinese team's midfielders were empty, and several Wu League warriors had already rushed to the ball, which fell to the Wu League's record line. The Chinese League was able to turn danger into safety.</p>
<h3>(II) Zhou Xianyan Forcefully Repels the Mighty Army</h3>
<p>When Li Ning cleared the ball, the ball fell into the Wu League's camp and was shot from the side by the Chinese team's forward Dai Linjing and dribbled by the right wing Cao Guicheng to the Wu League's border area, right in the middle of the Wu League's goal. Unfortunately, it was blocked by the Wu League's goalkeeper. Then, there was another melee. The two sides charged several times. The Wu League was not afraid of guns, charging straight and ramming into the Chinese team. In order to preserve its strength, the Chinese team did not want to make unnecessary sacrifices. At 5:25, who knew that the ball was shot by the Wu League's center forward and rebounded. Fortunately, it was kicked away by Zhang Shilong with one foot, but the Wu League regrouped and came back again. Even the Chinese team was surrounded, and the goal was in danger. At 5:27, the Wu team actually got a ball and rushed to the goal. Fortunately, the Zhou Iron Gate was quick-witted and grabbed it and counterattacked it in the Wu League's defense line. Before long, the notary blew the whistle to rest, and the first half ended in a draw.</p>
<h3>(III) Three Attacks Fail to Achieve Success</h3>
<p>After the five-minute break, the victory or defeat of the two armies was entirely dependent on the thirty minutes of the second half. Initially, the Wu team's center forward kicked off and passed it to the front left forward, who slanted and dribbled it with the right wing guard. He was met head-on by the Chinese team's left wing Chen Guangyao. Then, Chen Guangyao shot and sent it to the center forward. Dai Linjing obtained it and passed it to Chen Tian, but in the end, the Wu League's warriors from all directions arrived and the ball was scattered. At 5:41, the ball monster Li Huitang stepped out from the crowd, received a ball, and shot it at the Wu League's goal, but unfortunately, it was received by its goalkeeper, who seemed to be in pain, and reluctantly kicked the ball away. At 5:45, Li Huitang dribbled another ball, and just as he was about to shoot, he was scattered by the Wu League's forwards. Finally, at 5:46, Cao Guicheng passed a ball, and Li Huitang dribbled it up, slaying generals and entering, breaking through two passes in a row. When he reached the Wu League's second line of defense, he lifted his foot and the ball flew from the side of the Wu League's goal, but to no avail. The audience shook their heads and sighed.</p>
<h3>(IV) The Onlookers Sigh Secretly</h3>
<p>After the ball monster Li Huitang fiercely shot at the Wu League's goal three times without success, the Chinese audience in the whole stadium, seeing that the Wu League was brave but lacked strategy, but its strength could not be underestimated, and seeing that the time for the truce was approaching and the victory or defeat was still undecided, for the sake of the face of the compatriots, the honor of China, and the glory of the country, they were all worried and sighed secretly. The sincerity of the compatriots in protecting China can be seen here.</p>
<p>However, the Wu League also saw that the Chinese team had not been able to win in these five minutes, and thought of launching a major counterattack to seek the final victory. At the same time, the goalkeeper firmly defended the base camp, the defenders also attacked, and the forwards were all dispatched to the Chinese team's position. At this time, the Chinese team used a method of continuous flaws in attack and defense to break the League's formation, attacking and seizing each other. The Chinese team was besieged twice, like a stream of water that could not be discharged. The left side was blocked, and the right side came again. Many of them were knocked back by Li Ning's head. At this time, although the Wu League used brute force, it was not as rude and irritable as the Dutch League team the day before, secretly releasing cold arrows. In this respect, the Wu League was better than the Dutch League after all.</p>
<h3>(V) Good Luck Brings Continued Victory</h3>
<p>The two sides fought each other until 6:05, when with a thunderous sound, General Li, who was accurate in every shot, suddenly burst out with energy, rushed forward bravely, and used his magical art of passing through several enemies with one body. The Wu League's forwards were exhausted to cope. Before long, Liang Rongde passed in a ball, and Li Huitang immediately took the opportunity to use a half-lying shooting method, and with a swish, the ball flew into the Wu League's goal from behind. At the same time, the applause and the sound of firecrackers celebrating the victory were like mountains collapsing and the earth cracking. The compatriots had turned their worries into joy. When the battle resumed, the morale of the League and Wu teams was shaken by this defeat, and the courage to counterattack also plummeted. Therefore, the ball was often in the Wu League's second line of defense at this time. Although it was kicked back by the defenders several times, the forwards did not respond. At 6:08 (only two minutes away from the truce), the Chinese team's Chen Tian dribbled a ball and passed it to the center forward line for Li Huitang to dribble towards the Wu League, breaking through the second line of defense. When he lifted his foot, the ball flew and went into the net again. The applause thundered again. After rearranging the formation and fighting again, the two sides fought in a melee for two minutes, but there was no progress. Then, the notary blew the whistle to end the game. As a result, the score was two to zero, and China won again.</p>

<p>A: There's a powder magazine here; you can't smoke. Didn't you hear about the tragedy last month when someone smoking a cigarette here caused an explosion that killed twelve people?</p>
<p>B: But that won't happen today.</p>
<p>A: Why?</p>

<h3>Anecdotes about Mr. Yuan Guanlan</h3>
<p>— Zhang Limin</p>
<p>The senior educator, Mr. Yuan Guanlan of Baoshan, unfortunately passed away from illness last month. From then on, another educator in Jiangsu has weakened. It is truly regrettable. Recently, someone from Baoyi came and said that Mr. Yuan was outstanding in writing, excelling in both traditional and modern styles. His writings were all pertinent and were admired by us younger students. He was also skilled in speech. Whenever he participated in group organizations, agencies, and conferences, the audience was always fascinated by his speeches when he took the stage. I remember in the spring of the 18th year of the Republic, when the Jiangsu Tongzhi Compilation Committee convened a conference to discuss the gazetteer's outline, Mr. Yuan, as an advisor to the committee, was also present. I am recording his speech regarding the editing of the astronomy section: "According to the relationship between the local area and the stars, there was the so-called 'field division' in the past, which assigned the twelve states in the country to the constellations in the Zhou Tian two times. Before the Han Dynasty, many scholars had disputes about the distribution and the beginning and end of the degrees. After examining the modern scientific method of actual measurement, there is nothing that can be connected. However, in the past few decades, the gazetteers of the provinces and counties have mostly followed this and have not changed it. It is truly like still wearing a fox fur in the hot summer. It is extremely out of touch with the times. I urge you to remove this ancient saying of field division and not include it. Please do not be like wearing fur clothes in the hot summer and not taking them off, causing criticism for sweating but not exerting effort."</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan had a tall and extraordinary appearance, and his throat sound was like that of a woman returning home, which was also very rare.</p>
<h3>A Record of Intelligent and Courageous Sisters</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>There is a family with the surname of Mou in Zhangzhishan Town, Nanxiang, Nantong. The family is well-off and only has a father and two daughters. The elder sister is slightly older and is betrothed to a son of the Mou family in the same village as his wife. The wedding is scheduled for this winter, and the dowry and other items are being prepared. Many of the clothes and other items have also been made. Since the father has no sons, he will naturally give a particularly generous dowry when he marries off his eldest daughter. Unexpectedly, the hired seamstress saw so many silk clothes and harbored greedy intentions. One night, the father happened to be out on business and stayed overnight at a relative's house. The seamstress knew that the younger sisters were at home and were not to be feared, so she invited three or four people to go to their house late at night, hoping to steal all the wedding clothes. After arriving at their house, they broke in. The sisters heard the noise and knew that there were bandits. They were not too flustered. The elder sister stood at the door and saw a thief entering the room. She immediately grabbed him with her hands and resisted him. Her younger sister saw this and thought of helping her sister. Suddenly, she saw a large iron scale next to the door of the room. In a moment of desperation, she grabbed the scale bar and pretended to fire a gun at the thief, and twisted the iron button and iron hook at the end of the scale to make it sound like the mechanism on a gun. The thief could not tell the difference in the dark. Seeing the scale bar aimed at his face, he thought it was a real gun. He quickly turned his head and ran out desperately. The three accomplices were terrified and began to question the seamstress, who had instigated them. She had said that there were no guns in the Mou family's house. Under the cross-examination, the seamstress could not defend herself for a while, but she still could not fully believe it. The next morning, she went to the Mou family's house to work and learned the whole story of how the sisters had used the scale bar to repel the thieves the night before. She told her accomplices and they made another appointment to go and rob them again. Unexpectedly, on the second day after the incident, a cousin came to visit the sisters at home and told them about the whole story of repelling the thieves. He knew that the thieves would come back and that there was a spare pistol in this house. He quickly went home to get the gun and carefully instructed the sisters on how to fire it and how to be careful. Two days later, the thieves really came again. The elder sister saw the thieves coming and quickly fired the pistol at them. One thief was immediately hit and fell to the ground and died. The other thieves were shocked, because all of them were empty-handed and had no firearms. They immediately fled and had a big argument with the seamstress. In the end, the police found out about it, arrested them and put them in jail, and severely punished them.</p>
<h3>Inscriptions for the Chinese Buddhist Pilgrimage Tour</h3>
<p>— Zhao Dingming</p>
<p>The Chinese Buddhist Pilgrimage Tour took a boat to Xiamen yesterday. A few days ago, the tour leaders, Master Cibei and Master Bi Guan, held a roll of plain silk and went to the Oriental Bookstore Publishing House to ask the editors to write inscriptions. After looking through them, they were all famous calligraphies or poems or insightful essays by famous people at home and abroad. Each was extremely wonderful. I will record them with my pen and share them with the readers.</p>
<p>Our path is not lonely (Yousheng Pilgrimage Tour). Difficult to walk, but able to walk (Wang Zhen). Travel to the Buddhist countries (Xie Weiyin). Buddhist world (Lang Jingshan). Save all living beings (Yan Duhe). The earth is bright (Li Haoran). Coming from thousands of mountains and rivers (Hu Boxiang). Save all living beings from thousands of miles away (Sun Wu). Able to do very difficult and rare things (Yu Youren). Confining the world and suppressing mountains and rivers (Ye Gongchuo). Travel thousands of miles to promote Buddhism (Zhuang Xiquan). Ten years of facing the wall are not as good as traveling thousands of miles (Zhou Shoujuan). Follow in the footsteps of Xuanzang's legacy, and do not let the predecessors be beautiful alone (Huang Jingwan). It is not easy to enter the treasure mountain. Do not let your hands return empty again (Ding Fubao). Activity has wisdom. Wise activity can pacify the world (Yang Yuzhen). A true monk must be able to make Buddhism scientific and Buddhist disciples professional (Lin Jing). Since Bodhidharma came from the west, he was only looking for someone who would not be confused by others (Hu Shi). Go to India to collect the true Dharma of Buddhism and bring it back to China to save the people from fire and water (Gu Qizhong). Traveling in all directions to gain great freedom, and being alone with the spirit of heaven and earth, their aspiration is enough to hold mountains and surpass the sea (Liu Chaoxu). Sending guests away as guests to a far country in the south, I hope that the masters will work hard to make the real world the paradise in our ideals (Wei Juezhong). The true spirit of Buddhism is to benefit the group in almsgiving, precepts, and patience, to cultivate oneself in samadhi and prajna, and to persevere in diligence. One must be able to endure hardship and work hard to go to it. I hope you will encourage each other (Taixu). The Buddhism of China has Mahayana but no Hinayana. Wisdom and faith have high notes, but the precepts are not as good as those of the Hinayana people. I sincerely hope that you will strictly observe the Lengjia meat-eating precepts to be the best. Now that you are traveling in Ceylon, I hope to prove it with this (Zhang Binglin). Sakyamuni Buddha was born more than 2,000 years ago, and his Dharma will spread throughout the world. It is a pity that it has gradually declined since the Qing Dynasty. Now there are Cibei and Biguan comrades who are carrying out the mission of the Buddha and continuing the great aspirations of Faxian and Xuanzang. They have organized a Buddhist pilgrimage tour to explore the relics of the Buddha and his great Dharma and reveal them to the people of the world in order to explain the spirit of the Buddha's compassion and fearlessness. Now, he is about to leave the country. I will record a few words in advance to wish him success (Daxing Zhifeng). (1) I have not participated in Chan in Putuo twice, but I have indulged in idle talk for a hundred years. Life and death depend entirely on your thoughts. How many people worship Buddha to purify their hearts? (2) The Buddha's sitting in the rain is rumored in vain, and the bells and fish are listened to day and night. It is more difficult to distinguish between the threads of the outside world. I recall calling for tea in the library (3) I have rarely experienced hardships, and my waist and feet are still stubborn today. After stepping through a thousand steps of flying sand, I watched the sunrise at the Chaoyang Cave (4) The skirts are carefree, connecting the sea and the sky, and the heroic spirit is returned to the poems. Heaven reserves talent, and there are always a few young years in the eyes (Huang Yanpei). In the eighth century, there was a Jagat Guru in India who came out to promote restorationism in order to exclude Buddhism. In the twelfth century, Islam invaded again, and Buddhism suffered repeated blows and almost disappeared in India. However, the north and south sides have developed in particular. The northward advance was transmitted to the Western Regions and even to China, Korea, and Japan, most of which belonged to Mahayana Buddhism. The southward advance was transmitted to Ceylon, Burma, Siam, Java, and Annam, most of which belonged to Hinayana Buddhism. For thousands of years, they have never been in conflict with each other. Now the Chinese Buddhist Pilgrimage Tour does not hesitate to risk the distance to personally visit the countries with India as the end point. Can its thread connect the posts of the north and the south and be a pioneer for the revival of Buddhism? (Jiang Zhuzhuang)</p>
<h3>Lotus Root Musings</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>A young master chills it with ice, a fair lady relishes it like snow – lotus root!  As a thing, it is intricately porous, with fibers deeply intertwined.  The ancients called it a "spiritual root emerging from water," and with good reason.</p>
<p>Lotus root can be categorized as field lotus or pond lotus, with pond lotus from southern Jiangsu being of the highest quality.  During the late Qing Dynasty, it was often presented as tribute. There is what is called "damaged lotus root," where the leaves taste sweet due to insect damage. Also, the lotus marshes north of Mei Village are famous for producing lotus root; its sweetness and tenderness are not inferior to that of Gaoyou Chefang lotus root, which is incredibly crisp. However, the skin is rough and unsightly, which detracts from its appearance. Judging by appearances to lose out on talented individuals is not limited to lotus root. A single-section lotus root is considered the best, followed by a double-section, and then a triple-section.  Triangular lotus roots have small holes and thick flesh, while cylindrical ones have large holes and thin flesh.  Anyone purchasing lotus root sections should be aware of this.</p>
<p>Grate fresh lotus root into strands, strain the juice through coarse cloth.  After the starch settles, mix it with powdered sugar and then steep it in boiling water.  The refreshing fragrance and flavor are a thousand times better than the West Lake white lotus root flour sold in the market.  Alternatively, lotus root slices can be mixed with flour and fried in oil, creating what is called lotus root cakes.</p>
<p>To store lotus root, it must be buried in a shady, damp place or wrapped in mud, which allows it to be preserved for a long time.</p>
<p>Some lotus roots have strange and valuable names, such as the dry lotus root of Zhongnan Mountain, mentioned in the Book of Tang; the thousand-often-seen blue lotus root, mentioned in Records of Gleanings; and the jade well lotus flower blooming on the peak of Mount Hua, with ten-foot-long lotus roots like boats, mentioned in Han Yu's "Ancient Meaning." Also, the north produces a three-hole lotus root called "save-trouble-three," all found in Records of Unusual Things.</p>
<p>To represent affection that has not ended, people often use the image of lotus root with connected silk threads.  Xia Yizi, a talented man from Shanghai, once used lotus root silk as ink paste.  A small jar of ink paste consumed tens, even hundreds, of pounds of lotus root, a rare tale in the artistic world.</p>
<p>Take lotus root nodes, dry them under the eaves for a year, and then use them to brew soup for drinking.  It can relieve chest tightness and congestion.</p>
<p>Stuff lotus root holes with glutinous rice and steam it for cooked lotus root, or cook it with porridge for lotus root porridge, truly a refined dish for the home kitchen.</p>
<p>Yang Guifei wore mandarin duck side-by-side lotus patterned brocade trousers and socks.  Emperor Xuanzong teased her, saying, "The trousers and socks of the esteemed consort truly have mandarin ducks and lotus flowers! Otherwise, how could there be such white lotus roots inside?"  Therefore, Guifei named the trousers and socks "lotus root revival." This magnificence of lotus root is recorded here to complete the lotus root musings.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes from Southeast Asia (51)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>Mr. Dai and I discussed the similarities and differences between world ethnic cultures, based on my book "Case Studies in the Eastern University," in which I used evidence from Western scholars, from Heraclitus to modern times, to demonstrate the six major cultural systems of the East: Confucianism, Laoism, Yangism, Mohism, Buddhism, and Taoism. Mr. Wu Zhihui praised it as an unprecedented and unsurpassed work. Among them, Yang's teachings had long been forgotten. I brought them up incidentally and compared them with Heraclitus, connecting them to Bentham's utilitarianism. Yang's teachings are similar to Heraclitus's Epicurean School, which says that "pleasure is the highest good." "Let us eat and drink today, for tomorrow we may not be able to rely on anything." This is no different from Liu Ling and Ji Kang's philosophy of reaching life's limits, or the idea of "bury me when I die; I have wine today, so I'll be drunk today." Mohism, on the other hand, is harsh and demanding, no different from the Judaized Jesus. Yang is close to Heraclitus's pleasure-seeking, while Mo is close to the Jewish asceticism. Lao is close to the naturalness of India, and the Indian philosophy is high and far away, difficult to reach from this lower earth. Confucius's doctrine of the mean is very similar to the golden mean of the three Greek philosophers including Aristotle. Qu Yuan's theory of good governance (see "Universal Peace") is very similar to William Morris's good social policy and today's American social organization law, all of which are the essence of world civilization.</p>
<p>On the 17th, Ms. Li Yunde, the principal of a Fujian girls' school, hosted a banquet at the Kek Lok Si Temple, the most famous scenic spot in Southeast Asia. Clear springs flow from the top of the mountain, and pools are set up along the mountainside to raise flowers, turtles, and fish. The lighting is well-equipped.</p>
<p>On the 18th, I visited the Nanjing Hotel by the sea. The layout is very exquisite. Watching the sea water hit the shore and the tall trees lining the beach. The tall trees here are very similar to those in Beijing parks, except they are not pine trees. Each foreign house hangs a large red lantern, similar to those used in Chinese government offices, with the owner's surname written in large Song Dynasty characters, which is a northern custom. Each household also writes their clan name at the entrance, such as Pengcheng, Tianshui, Xihe, and Anding, to show their clan. It can be seen that the emphasis on surnames is well-developed among overseas Chinese. The houses are all magnificent. In Singapore, many are the color of rice flour, but here the color is slightly lighter because it is close to India. The clothing is mostly yellow, as yellow is considered noble. The monks' robes are also yellow. The betel nut horns in Penang are more beautiful than in other places, and the quality is also firm. The horns are especially long. The rickshaws are larger than those in Singapore, and the trams run too slowly, almost allowing one to get on and off at any place. The skin of the local men and women is still black, but the women are physically very strong, truly slender and graceful, unlike the weakness of our women. Their gait is upright, without any slanting or twisting. But their skin is only black, and their bone structure is still similar to that of Europeans, probably because they are mostly of the Aryan race.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (278)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Green Bamboo Tears, Lady's Heart Broken; Red Lotus Fragrance Fades, Maiden's Soul Departs</p>
<p>Zhang Yiqing rented a two-story house to hide his mistress. At that time, a two-story house in Shanghai only rented for fifteen or sixteen yuan, but he spent several hundred yuan on decoration, wallpapering, and installing electric lights, really bustling for a while. In addition, he bought rosewood foreign furniture, copper beds, mirrors, and screens, everything complete. Cuiyun was also happy and content, thinking she had found her right place. Who knew that in just a few days, she would discover that he had another old woman in Shanghai. Originally, the day he married Cuiyun was the day the Yangtze River steamer departed. His family thought Zhang Yiqing had boarded the ship to Hankou. However, the Yangtze River steamer, after going upstream, always had to go downstream. At most, it would only be seven or eight days before it returned. When it returned, he inevitably had to go home. So, five or six days into the week, Zhang Yiqing explained to her that he had wanted this for a while, it had been done. It was like something he wanted in his heart that he had already gotten his hands on. There was nothing serious about it. He told her, "This woman is not my official wife, but she helped me a lot in the beginning. Now she is old, but I cannot abandon her just because she is old. Of course, I have to appease her, but I really like you, so don't worry." Cuiyun was naturally unhappy. She had clearly been tricked by him, clearly deceived by him. She said, "Then why didn't you explain it clearly in the beginning?" Zhang Yiqing gave a sly smile and said, "If I had explained it clearly, would you still have married me?" Cuiyun's face turned pale upon hearing this. Zhang Yiqing then said, "But please forgive me. The woman in my Ningbo hometown is an ugly villager. She won't come to Shanghai. I won't let her come to Shanghai either. But in my twenty years of doing business in Shanghai, would I never have a woman, always be single? If you think about it, a woman always wants to have a man when she turns twenty. She can't be an old maid forever. Men are the same. You can understand this." Cuiyun thought about it, and it was true. Why hadn't she thought of it in the beginning? But what could she do now? The die was cast. Could she break up with him because of this? Originally, Zhang Yiqing had only spent a little over two thousand yuan to marry Cuiyun. Cuiyun had used the two thousand yuan to pay off her debts and give her father a few hundred yuan. She had also bought some favorite ornaments. The two thousand yuan was long gone. However, Zhang Yiqing, being a famous businessman, had commercial means. He forced Cuiyun's father to write a bill of sale, selling Cuiyun's body to Zhang Yiqing. Zhang Yiqing had obtained all of Cuiyun's rights.</p>

<p>The inventory continues to be deposited, while the sale of new goods has not come and volume continue.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market's Downturn Gradually Intensifies</h3>
<p>The cotton market is quite sluggish, and a downward trend is emerging. American cotton spot prices have fallen below the 11-cent mark. This is due to the global cotton industry's sluggishness and excessive raw material supplies in various countries. This situation has been reported in this newspaper before. Indian cotton is selling at relatively low prices in the market, and factories are purchasing some. Indian cotton is completely encroaching on the market share of domestic cotton. Furthermore, the Hankou area has had a good harvest year, and market prices have fallen by two to three yuan. Therefore, a large portion of speculators have turned from bullish to bearish. The afternoon market was very weak. However, domestic merchants have not yet fully entered the market, and only half of the speculative merchants have turned bearish. Judging from the situation of foreign cotton, it is very difficult to stabilize the market. However, the recent unstable weather has made some people uneasy. The yarn market is not good, and Indian cotton merchants are eagerly seeking a way out. Prices are willing to make significant concessions, and the pressure is increasing.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Drops Another Four Cents: The Hankou standard market opened with a very sluggish sentiment. There was a lack of buyers in the market, and prices fell by one and a half cents. The second session slightly recovered, resulting in a fall of one cent. In the afternoon, it was heard that Indian cotton was being offered at very cheap prices, and the downward trend intensified. Prices fell by three cents. The total trading volume for the day was 56,200 dan. The sales included 2,300 dan from Tianchang, 3,000 dan from Xiesheng, 2,400 dan from Heshen, 1,700 dan from Maoji, and 1,100 to 1,400 dan from others. The purchases included 4,100 dan from Xincheng, 2,100 bales from Gongtai, 2,200 dan from Daji, 2,400 dan from Minghua, and 1,000 to 1,800 dan from others.

<h3>American Cotton Hits New Low Again</h3>
<p>American Cotton Enters Customs at 1 Cent: Yesterday, the American cotton market was quiet and firm due to a lack of sellers. It was initially firm due to good news from Liverpool, but later softened due to some long positions being closed out. Futures prices fluctuated by one to five points, while spot prices fell by five points. British cotton futures rose by three to four points, while spot prices fell by two points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by ten points. The Indian cotton market was stable, and Japanese merchants made purchases. Pingguoer and Bairuoxi fell by two rupees, and Aomula fell by one rupee.

<h3>Grains: Hexia Rice Market is Flat</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the supply from Lilu was very scarce, and sales were flat. Broken indica rice reached over 100 shi, with prices opening at 20 yuan and 7.5 jiao. The situation appeared hidden. There was not much high-quality West Xinjing rice, with a total of about 200 shi. The price was 20 yuan and 5 jiao. Dong Xinjing rice initially showed a softening trend, but due to the weather turning cloudy again, it temporarily maintained the original market. The price was still 20 yuan. The overall indica rice situation was very flat. The demand for new Yangjian rice was average, and the supply was also scarce. Prices opened at 14 yuan and 7-8 jiao. New Kejian rice arrived in abundance, and the outflow was not smooth. The general price was 13 yuan and 5-6 jiao. The sales of Baiyuan rice were not good, and the price opened at 18 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: The arrival of river rice was declining, and sales were not smooth. The Changbang white indica rice was extremely scarce. The top-quality of Lin Tong's broken indica rice opened at 19 yuan and 5 jiao, and the overall trend was stable. New indica rice has turned to sideways movement, so the price seemed to fluctuate slightly. The arrival and sales of Southbang thin early rice were both sluggish, and market transactions were very limited. The supply of Yangjian rice was continuous, and the sales of new Jian rice were still brisk. The above overall prices were generally unchanged. The top-quality rice opened at 14 yuan at Guanzuo.</p>
<h3>Early Machine Rice Arrives in Abundance, Price Drops</h3>
<p>Yesterday, customer indica rice continued to arrive, with machine early indica rice accounting for the majority. The local market had a slightly weaker appetite, and the customer merchants' intentions were even more stagnant. The entire market only saw Yantai merchants buying 200 bags of Hunan broken rice. Other merchants did not inquire. Therefore, the market sentiment turned soft. Machine early indica rice had a relatively large inventory, and the price fell slightly. Other types of rice remained stable. The total sales for the day included 400 bags of Hunan Jing rice, 1,000 bags of Jiangxi machine early indica rice, 300 bags of machine late indica rice, and 300 bags of machine yuan rice. Except for the 200 bags of Xiang rice loaded by Yantai, all were purchased by local merchants.</p>
<h3>30,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Still Exist</h3>
<p>The foreign rice floating in the market has long been sold out. The amount purchased and stored by hoarders and rice shops is also small. Most of it is distributed to customers or sold retail. Therefore, there has long been no price quotation for foreign rice in the South Market and the General Association. According to a survey of the rice industry, the total amount of foreign rice stored in Shanghai, excluding rice shops and odd quantities, is still about 30,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice and several thousand bags of other types of rice. This batch of goods is prepared for sale at flat prices. Currently, new rice has entered the market, and rice prices are gradually falling. The authorities believe that there is no need to engage in flat price sales in the future. Therefore, the 30,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice in storage are planned to be sold in the market in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Rebound Due to Short Covering</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed an upward trend in the morning and afternoon. Because the quoted price of foreign wheat was only about 0.2 yuan lower, the sentiment was naturally soft in the initial session. However, short sellers who had profited were taking this opportunity, believing that time should not be lost, and covered their positions on a large scale. Therefore, the sluggish situation suddenly turned lively. It is speculated that the psychology of covering short positions is due to the fact that although foreign wheat is cost-effective, it still requires a 5.1 tael opening fee. According to the standard, it still exceeds quite a bit. Therefore, they are taking the opportunity to cover their positions, or they may have to re-enter the market in the future. It seems that the current situation is still under the control of short sellers. As a result, the current month rose 4 cents compared to the previous day, October rose 4 cents, November rose 5 cents, December rose 7 cents, and January and February rose 6 cents. The spot wheat market remains sluggish, but manufacturers see that the market price is already low and have started to act. Secondary goods have fallen about 0.1 yuan compared to the previous week, and nearly 0.2 yuan compared to the beginning of this month. The entire market opened with over 9,000 bags of wheat from Taierzhuang, Yaowan, and Haizhou. About 6,000 bags were purchased by factories such as Fufeng and Shenda.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Still Difficult to be Optimistic</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market trended sideways in the morning and afternoon. Since the quoted price of foreign wheat was cut by another 0.2 yuan, the sentiment in the initial opening was not great. Distant months were about 0.1 yuan softer than the closing price of the previous day. Then, due to the strong short covering from various firms and factories, prices rebounded. By the time the afternoon session opened, because futures prices rebounded due to short covering... (the sentence is cut off mid-way).</p>
<p>The buying interest from both domestic and foreign sources also turned slightly lively. However, the environment is no longer what it used to be. Customers have foreign flour in preparation, and factories have already started ordering foreign wheat. Therefore, if the ban on sales to the north is lifted and flour has a way out, the market may turn stable. Otherwise, the selling pressure is strong and it is not easy to be optimistic. As a result, the current month was down 0.25%, October was down 0.5%, November was down 0.25%, December was up 0.25%, January was up 0.5%, and February was unchanged.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Eastern Goods Turn Downward Quickly</h3>
<p>The rising trend in the Eastern goods textile market has ceased recently, and yesterday it even turned downward quickly. This is because the price increase last week was too severe, resulting in sluggish real sales. Holders of goods found it difficult to sell them off in the short term, causing the market sentiment to soften sharply. Yesterday, Yuehua velvet was down 0.25%, and Wakayama's Three Children black flower was selling at 1.9 yuan per share. Most medium-sized handles were selling at 1.95 yuan. Last week, Jiangsu merchants had offered 2 yuan and 0.2%, a drop of 7.5%. Gongduan Gongni was uniformly down 0.25%, and cotton flannel was also down slightly. Yesterday, Fuhua's large group was 1.875 yuan, and the concubine color was 1.775 yuan. Only bleached cloth remained firm. The Magpie Bridge Meeting opened at 10.08 taels, Shuang Zongtong at 10.085 taels, Guo Ziyi at 10.075 taels, and Flower Bird at 7.75 taels. Foreign standard Chongsu silk, Gaitaorong, and others did not have significant changes. Customer sales were very quiet. The Tianjin merchants, who had been active for a while, have now stopped operating. The Yangtze River basin remains stagnant. Local merchants are even more reluctant to take delivery of goods. Only Sichuan merchants are slightly active.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods: Xiang Lian Arrives Scarcely, Price Rises</h3>
<p>This year's Xiang Lian production was abundant, but the arrival of goods has been scarce recently, causing prices to rise steadily. This is because the current situation is that local areas are suffering from frequent disturbances, and cash is often plundered. Owners of goods consider hiding money as a dangerous pursuit and turn to hiding goods instead. Therefore, the arrival of goods is scarce. Currently, the prices in the Shanghai market are: Xiangtan lotus seeds at 45 taels, Raozhou lotus seeds at 44 taels, Hengzhou lotus seeds at 44 taels, Changde lotus seeds at 42 taels, and white lotus seeds at 42 taels. The market sentiment is stable.</p>

<h3>This Year's Plague and Rat Plague</h3>
<p>Dr. Wu Lien-teh's Investigation Report</p>
<p>The investigation report by Dr. Wu Lien-teh, Director of the National Epidemic Prevention Bureau and concurrently Director of the Northeast Provinces Epidemic Prevention Bureau, on plague and other epidemics in China has been published. The main contents are as follows: (1) Plague: In the summer of last year, Liu Ruiheng, Minister of Health, repeatedly convened Shanghai health experts to discuss measures to prevent and control plague. Dr. Qiao Teng, Director of the Health Department of the Shanghai Public Concession Board, Mr. Fantia of the French Concession Board, and Dr. Hu Hongji, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Government Health Bureau, were all present. It was decided to establish a</p>
<p>Central Plague Bureau to collect reports on plague epidemics from various locations and distribute them to relevant agencies for reference. At that time, Dr. Wu was appointed as the director to oversee everything. The bureau was attached to the Epidemic Prevention Bureau. In order to investigate the medium of plague transmission and trace the origin of the epidemic, Dr. Wu transferred several specialists from his Harbin office to Shanghai to carry out this work. All research procedures were conducted in the sanitary laboratory set up by the government. (Note: The bureau also has many experts specializing in the study of the occurrence of germs and the injection to resist plague.) This work began on June 1 of this year and continued until August 28, totaling three months. A total of 1,600 stool samples from patients with various intestinal and abdominal diseases were collected from various locations in Shanghai. Although microorganisms resembling plague were found in more than 50 of these 1,600 samples, the true source of plague (Vibrio) that is believed by doctors was not found at all. It was not until August 28 that a true case of plague occurred in a person in Hongkou Hospital. The patient recovered soon after treatment in the hospital. According to investigations, a total of 49 cases of this disease were successively infected from that time until September, and only four people died as a result. The rest all recovered after treatment. Several points are noteworthy about the outbreak of plague this time: (1) The disease is not very dangerous; (2) It began to occur after the hot weather had passed; (3) It began to occur long after the watermelon season; (4) The epidemic will probably not last long. At present, Shanghai health authorities are making every effort to cooperate in seeking ways to curb it. It is still difficult to predict the effect of the municipal government's anti-epidemic injections. The 600,000 doses of injections that have been used are all manufactured by domestic laboratories. By the end of August, the Public Concession had administered 66,338 doses of injections. By September 14, the French Concession had administered a total of 66,021 doses. By the end of August, the Municipal Government Health Department had administered a total of 377,212 doses. (2) Other Epidemics: The Northeast Provinces Epidemic Prevention Bureau must prevent the occurrence of rat plague in the southern Manchuria regions bordering Mongolia every year. In mid-August, a Chinese worker in a village in Mongolia suddenly developed this disease. By August 14, a total of 30 cases of rat plague had been recorded. At the beginning of this month, Wang Yicun, a medical officer sent by Harbin to investigate epidemics, discovered that there was a rat plague epidemic among the cavalry stationed in Tongliao. Every day, four or five people died from this epidemic. In addition, there were four cases of rat plague in a village near the Kaitong Railway, but the investigation was extremely difficult due to the heavy floods in the area. Approximately 60 cases of rat plague will occur this year. There is no doubt that the nature of this rat plague is true rat plague. These several locations are the source of the rat plague, and multiple cases must occur every year. It is deeply hoped that the Epidemic Prevention Bureau will do its best to prevent it from being easily eliminated. The recent news of a rat plague epidemic issued by the Japanese News Agency is not overly alarming. As soon as the Northeast Provinces Epidemic Prevention Bureau hears of an epidemic in a certain place, it immediately sends medical officers to curb it and will never let it spread.</p>
<h3>Latest News on Shanghai-Chongqing Aviation</h3>
<p>Jiujiang Returns to Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Hoping to Re-Fly in the Coming Days</p>
<p>The setback in the Shanghai-Chongqing line test flight of the China National Aviation Corporation has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the Jiujiang aircraft flew back to Shanghai at 4 pm yesterday, waiting for the Ministry of Transport to negotiate with Liu Xiang before re-flying. After the setback occurred, He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of Hankou, and Wang Boqun, Minister of Transport, sent telegrams to Sichuan Liu respectively. Yesterday, a reply telegram was received from Commander Liu, hoping that the Ministry of Transport would send someone to Chongqing to discuss the matter in person. However, the Ministry of Transport believed that sending someone would take a long time, so it immediately sent a long telegram detailing everything. A decision will be made after receiving a reply telegram. However, the airline hopes to re-fly in the coming days, otherwise the originally scheduled official flight of Shanghai-Chongqing aviation in early October will be difficult and will therefore be suspended. Smith, the head of the air navigation team, Hamilton, the vice chairman, and Bian Fugeng, a mechanic, arrived in Shanghai with the plane yesterday. Nie Kaiyi, the deputy director, deplaned in Beijing and did not come.</p>
<h3>Issue of Japanese Cocoons Imported into China</h3>
<p>Customs Strictly Prohibits Importation: This port's customs authorities yesterday received an instruction from the Ministry of Finance, stating that in order to comply with the case, Administrative Yuan Instruction No. 3241 was followed. The instruction stated that a letter from the Civilian Affairs Office of the National Government, forwarded by the Chairman, mentioned a telegram from the Jiaxing County Merchants' United Committee, stating that the import of Japanese cocoons into Shanghai harmed domestic production, and the actions of treacherous merchants buying them were outrageous. It was heard that several batches were waiting to be imported. If this was not quickly prohibited, the consequences would be unthinkable. It was requested that the customs authorities be ordered to strictly prohibit the import of all Japanese cocoons to prevent future troubles and protect domestic production. The Chairman ordered an investigation and handed the case to the Executive Yuan for investigation and handling. It was noted that the Central Executive Committee's Secretariat had previously received a telegram from Zhejiang cocoon merchants Jiang Shifang and others, stating that Japanese cocoons were being sold cheaply in China, affecting Chinese cocoons, and requesting heavy taxation. This was approved and handed over to the Executive Yuan for investigation and handling. As the previous reasons were now received again, a corresponding letter was sent to inform them and instructed them to handle the matter accordingly. It was noted that Zhejiang cocoon merchants Jiang Shifang and others had previously submitted a telegram to the Executive Yuan, which was handed over to the Ministry for review. Now, according to the previous instructions, in addition to sending a reply and issuing separate orders, the Ministry should be ordered to quickly instruct the customs authorities to strictly prohibit the import of all Japanese cocoons to protect domestic production. Upon receiving this order, the Customs Superintendent, Hua Jiwen, had already instructed all subordinates to comply.</p>
<p>Reasons Stated by Manufacturers: The General Association of Silk and Cocoons of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui sent a circular, stating that the Jiaxing Cocoon Industry Association, the Haiyan Cocoon Industry Association, the Shengzhu and Xin Three Counties Cocoon Industry Association, and all farmers in Jiahu, including Mr. Jiang Laixian, Zhao Jiexiang, Lu Qianan, Wang Weisan, Cheng Huilian, Zhong Bosen, and the Hai'ning Cocoon Industry, including Zhong Guangyan and Wang Qingquan, all noted that they had received letters and telegrams regarding the issue of Japanese cocoons being imported and suppressing cocoons, harming cocoon merchants and farmers. They were fully aware of the concerns of the public and the protection of farmers and merchants, and admired them beyond words. However, the situation in this case may not be fully understood by the public, leading to misunderstandings. The facts must be explained in detail to dispel rumors. This year's cocoon harvest is poor, and the situation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is roughly the same. The Zhejiang factories are slightly less affected, only about one-sixth of the production of Jiangsu Province, and may be able to barely maintain the status quo. However, if Jiangsu is considered, there are about 150 factories in Shanghai and Wuxi, with approximately 38,000 machines. The amount of dried cocoon raw materials needed for the entire year of twelve months is about 500,000 dan. It was previously investigated that the cocoon production in Jiangsu and the amount transported from other provinces, as well as a small number of summer cocoons, was less than 300,000 dan. The supply and demand are barely balanced, with a shortage of about 45%. If there is no relief measure, the factories will have to stop reeling after only six or seven months of work. How can the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of male and female workers in the factories not be pitied? This is why it is necessary to plan for the mulberry land and barely continue the work. This is the reason for purchasing Japanese cocoons. This matter was discussed in June, and most of the colleagues in the Shanghai factories requested the Industry Association to find a solution. The association then submitted a petition, specifically to avoid import duties, as the purchase of foreign cocoons is subject to tariffs and is not prohibited. Moreover, this is a temporary relief measure of a limited nature, so there is no need to apply for registration. The Ministry approved a reduction in tariffs, taxing 7.5% of the value, limited to 60,000 dan, until March of next year, and other industries may not follow suit. This is the fact of purchasing Japanese cocoons. The General Association planned this temporary relief measure entirely for the future of silk merchants and factory workers, without any bias. In this era of cocoon shortage, the import of 60,000 dan of Japanese cocoons is to alleviate the cocoon shortage, and there is still concern that it may not be enough. How can it suppress Chinese cocoons and invade the farmers? Moreover, the restrictions are strict and under our control, so there will be no other abuses. Unexpectedly, letters and telegrams flew in, saying that it was collusion, Japanese invasion, and Japanese sabotage. Who is not a colleague? Who is a treacherous merchant? The accusations were deafening. But who knew why? It has been observed that when there is a shortage of rice in the inland, Saigon rice is purchased to feed the people. When yarn factories lack raw materials, foreign cotton is purchased. When flour mills lack wheat, American wheat is purchased to maintain work. Farmers and merchants have never been heard to call for obstructing Chinese rice, invading Chinese cotton, or sabotaging Chinese wheat. For years, Japanese merchants have purchased double-cocoon goods for export, with raw materials flowing out. We have only heard requests from manufacturers to ban them, and have not heard a single word from cocoon merchants. Promoting the collection of raw materials and the export of products is essential for the industrial world in the East and West, and is not comparable to the import of finished goods solely to invade the economy. There is a clear distinction between these positive and negative proportions, and accusations should not be made based on common rhetoric. Currently, Japanese cocoons have not yet arrived in China, but the purchase of cocoons is limited and the demand for cocoons is still greater than this number. Even if 60,000 dan are purchased, it is still hoped that the remaining cocoons can be sold by merchants. Farmers have already become indirectly harmless. Even if cocoon merchants hold cocoons and seek to sell them at higher prices, it will not hinder their interests. Planning with chopsticks, there is no need to worry unnecessarily and make a fuss over nothing. If the cocoon market next year is a concern, the restrictions are in place before the new cocoons come out, and no cocoons beyond the 60,000 dan will be imported, so there is no concern about the destruction of cocoons and mulberry or the devouring of manufacturers. Otherwise, how could the ruling officials not know the disadvantages and approve it so quickly, as the public said? What the public said is mostly for the cocoon industry, but the position of the General Association has to take into account both the factory and the industry, adjusting the surplus and reducing the shortage. It is important to be expedient, using Chu talents for the purpose of relief. The public is clear and should be able to understand. Recently, newspapers have been spreading rumors that Japanese cocoons are coming to China, and that the transport of cocoons has been suspended. We cannot determine the truth or falsehood, but the autumn cocoon harvest has also been poor, and cannot make up for the loss of the spring cocoons. The actual need is that the purchase of Japanese cocoons must be carried out according to the plan. We hope that you will be calm and patient, and we will never let the remaining cocoons of Chinese merchants have the worry of being stored and tragically dropped. We sincerely reply, hoping to dispel misunderstandings and hoping for understanding.</p>
<h3>Two Organizations Oppose Increasing Water Prices</h3>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Issues Declaration of Opposition</p>
<p>Taxpayers' Association Requests Withdrawal of Price Increase Proposal</p>
<p>The case of the public concession increasing water prices has aroused opposition from various organizations. Yesterday, the City Chamber of Commerce also issued a declaration of opposition, and the Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a long letter to the Public Works Department, based on the facts, requesting the withdrawal of the price increase proposal to comply with public opinion. The original letter is recorded below.</p>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Issues Declaration: The City Chamber of Commerce issued a declaration stating that the Public Concession Water Company, using the excuse of a sharp decline in the exchange rate, requested an increase in water prices by 25%, which was passed by the Public Works Department's Board of Directors. All sectors of the city, as well as various agencies and organizations, believe that this move violates public interest and disregards the interests of the people, and have raised protests, pointing out the reasons in great detail. The association has two more opinions to which it respectfully requests the attention of all sectors: (1) Regarding the water price fixed rate period, the contract signed between the company and the Public Works Department stipulated a period of five years. In terms of the principle of the sanctity of contracts, the company cannot violate the rules and request a price increase within the stipulated period of the contract, and the Public Works Department cannot violate the rules and approve a price increase. The company argues that the exchange rate has plummeted and the annual dividend is not enough to cover the costs. Is this reason enough to suddenly allow a price increase before the expiration of the period? Does the original contract have such an exception? We should ask the Public Works Department to publicly review the contract. Otherwise, the Public Works Department should be responsible for disregarding the interests of all citizens by allowing a price increase before the contract expires. (2) Should this kind of direct increase in the burden on citizens be decided by the citizens themselves, or can it be entrusted to the City Board of Directors to decide on their behalf? After this lesson, we should feel that the city system in the concession needs fundamental revision. At the very least, we should strive for Chinese taxpayers to participate in the taxpayers' annual meeting on an equal footing with foreigners residing in Shanghai, so that the entire opinion of the citizens can be raised to make a powerful decision on issues related to the interests of the citizens themselves. As the saying goes, scholars must be ambitious and have a long way to go. May all citizens have keen eyes and meticulous steps to move forward.</p>
<p>Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to Public Works Department: The Taxpayers' Association yesterday sent a letter to the Board of Directors of the Public Concession Public Works Department, stating that the General Assembly of the association had previously discussed the case of increasing water prices in the Public Concession on September 5 and decided that the case was related to increasing the burden on residents and needed to be carefully reconsidered. In addition to handing it over to the Executive Committee to form a special committee for careful study, the Public Works Department should first be informed by letter to suspend the implementation of the price increase proposal. The association had previously recorded the case on September 6 and sent a special letter to your bureau to take note of it. Now, after the special committee for this case has studied the results, it believes that the price increase of public concession water should be prevented in terms of law and reason. The industry specifically requests your bureau to follow the public opinion of the residents and immediately withdraw the original proposal. The reasons for the withdrawal are described below: (A) In terms of legal theory, according to the contract signed between the Public Concession Public Works Department and the Shanghai Water Company on March 17, 1928, the effective period is 20 years. During the effective period of the contract, the Public Works Department has no need to consider any request made by the Water Company that violates the contract in terms of legal theory or approval. Moreover, according to Article 13 of the contract, the water price period must be five years, and the Public Works Department's announcement in 1929 changed it to two years. The Public Works Department cannot but bear the responsibility for this disregard for the sanctity of the contract. Even if it is said that it can be modified with the consent of both parties, this is a public utility, and every move is related to the third party of residents, and it is not a purely contractual relationship that stipulates the rights and obligations of the two parties. Taking a step back, even if the water price period has been changed to two years, it must be changed until July 1, 1931, and a proposal must be made five months before the deadline. Now, the deadline has not arrived, and the procedures are lacking. How can the Public Works Department immediately approve the company's request and rashly consider it or approve it? In terms of legal theory, the Public Works Department's approval of the company's price increase is fundamentally invalid. (B) In terms of fact (1) The Water Company's proposed price increase is due to the sharp decline in the British-Shanghai exchange rate and the rise in prices. As a result, this year's net profit is not enough to cover the annual dividend. However, the sharp decline in the exchange rate is a temporary phenomenon. For example, the British exchange rate at the time the Water Company proposed the price increase was 1 shilling and 6 pence, according to the announcement on August 6. But the current British exchange rate has changed to 1 shilling and 7 pence and 25 pence. Compared to the two, the exchange rate has gradually increased. The Water Company cannot base its future speculation on a temporary phenomenon. The first reason why the price increase case should not be established in terms of the exchange rate. (2) The company said that the price of goods has risen, and the water fee should be raised accordingly. However, the payment of water fees is calculated based on the rent, not independently. In other words, according to the rent percentage of six, Shanghai rents have increased year by year due to the prosperity of the population and the shortage of supply. Since the water price is calculated with the rent, it will naturally continue to increase every year. For example, the rent 25 years ago was only 50 yuan per month in the same location, but now it requires 300 yuan, which is an eightfold increase compared to before. The water price also increases by eightfold accordingly. The second reason why the price increase case should not be established in terms of the high rent. (3) The company said that the dividend is not enough to reach the maximum limit of 9%, which will not attract new capital and lead to the stagnation of business. However, the association believes that this reason is not sufficient. For example, the sale of the electrical station has 8.1 million taels of silver, and recently the Shanghai Electric Power Company issued 2 million taels of 6% preferred shares, which were immediately gathered. Also, when the China and Foreign Telephone Company tendered, there were as many as three companies competing to purchase it. This is also enough to prove the ease of gathering capital. Moreover, there is a risk of bad debts and rotten debts in the electricity and telephone business, and they are not necessities that individuals must use. As for tap water, on the one hand, it is necessary for residents to use, and on the other hand, the landlord remits the water price, without the labor of collecting it from each household. It is the most stable and reliable business in public utilities. How can there be such a stable and reliable business that is not enough to attract capital? The third reason why the price increase case should not be established in terms of fundraising. (4) The company must increase prices due to insufficient dividend payments. I do not know to what extent the company's so-called insufficient refers to. If it is said that it is not enough to pay 9%, then the contract must stipulate that the dividend</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>9% must not be exceeded or reduced. However, the contract only stipulates that the dividend is up to 9%. It can be known that the dividend can be paid at any rate below 9%. Since the company has no basis to pay 9%, the Public Works Department has no reason to order residents to pay the company's shareholders at the highest interest rate. Moreover, even if the company's dividend must be paid at 9%, it can be supplemented by future profits according to the contract. If it is said that the exchange rate will definitely not rise and there is no hope, then the London price of silver in 1920 rose to 61.5 pence, and the Shanghai exchange rate rose to 8 or 9 shillings. I am afraid that no one could have predicted it before the deadline. The company benefited greatly from the pound at that time. Why did it not propose to reduce the price? It did not reduce the price when the British exchange rate was high, but it requested a price increase when the British exchange rate was short. Judging from the circumstances, is it peaceful? The fourth reason why the price increase case should not be established in terms of dividends. (5) The company recently published a talk in the Mainland News, saying that the number of water users has increased due to the increase in population, believing that it is necessary to increase prices. However, at the same time, the company did not take into account how many more buildings there were than 25 years ago, how much more the total rent was than 25 years ago, and how much the actual price of water per thousand gallons was 25 years ago and how much it is now. If the rate of population increase, the rate of rent increase, and the actual price rate per thousand gallons of package water are made into statistics for detailed examination, then the company's talk will be difficult to make people believe. Perhaps the company knew this statistic clearly, but deliberately did not publish it publicly? The fifth reason why the price increase case should not be established in terms of population increase. (6) The company said that the cost of labor and materials is too high, resulting in huge expenses, and the remaining profit is not enough to distribute dividends. However, the water price has increased with the increase of rent, so there is no reason why it is not enough to allocate it. Moreover, due to the increase in the amount of business, according to the principles of industrial economics, its benefits must be increased. According to the survey, the price of tap water in the public concession is 50 cents per thousand gallons, while the price of water in the southern city of Zhabei is only 45 cents per thousand gallons. The same enterprise has the same labor and materials, and the price and business are better than the other. Who can believe that there is no profit? Moreover, the water pipes and installation costs of the branch pipes are borne by the landlord. The company does not bear any of the costs on the water pipes, and can also get a sales profit. Also, the water price should be charged at 6% of the rent, but the actual amount obtained exceeds 6%. For example, if the rent is 100 taels and the water fee is 6 taels, the actual rent is only 94 taels. The water fee of 6 taels is charged on 94 taels, and the income is already 6.39%. This extra income is 0.36 per 100 taels, and the total is also considerable. The sixth reason why the price increase case should not be established in terms of the cost of labor and materials. While the case was being reviewed, it was approved that the City Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Real Estate Association and other groups have sent letters for the same reason, which is enough to prove that opposing the increase in water prices is the public opinion of all residents. A corresponding letter is sent, hoping that your bureau will review it and immediately withdraw the case of approving the Shanghai Water Company's increase in prices by 25%. In order to clarify the company's content to the residents, your bureau should organize a special committee to investigate the company's accounts over the years, prepare a report, and publish it to prevent the company from taking improper profits by using the monopoly of public utilities. We also hope that your bureau will clearly announce the withdrawal of this case and reply. This is addressed to the Board of Directors of the Public Concession Public Works Department.</p>

<h3>Explanation from Shanghai Water Company</h3>
<p>Reply to the Real Estate Association Letter</p>
<p>The Shanghai Water Company replied to the Shanghai Real Estate Association on the 15th of this month, stating that they had received your letter of September 9 protesting against the company's recent increase in water fees by 25%, which was approved by the Public Works Department and notified to users. The case has been carefully considered by both parties before being approved by the Public Works Department and the company. After reading your letter, the directors of the company respectfully reply to the items stated in your letter as follows: Your association said that the company has not reduced prices when the exchange rate was high. According to the contract signed between the company and the Public Works Department from 1905 to 1927, the water price was fixed and the calculation of dividends was unlimited. Moreover, after the European War, the prices of all goods soared. Although the exchange rate was high at that time, the company did not take much profit. If the contract signed between the company and the Public Works Department cannot be changed according to the times, the company will not be able to attract capital and meet the increasing demand for water. The contract signed between the company and the Public Works Department on March 17, 1928, stated that the company's dividend was fixed and the water price could be revised from time to time. Your association said that the company is making high profits for shareholders with the money of the citizens. The company cannot admit this because the interest rate distributed to each shareholder must not exceed the interest rate approved by the Public Works Department. Your association should be able to understand the above two points, so that users did not enjoy the benefit when the exchange rate was high. If the exchange rate could be high after the company and the Public Works Department signed the contract in 1928, users would be able to enjoy the benefit. Therefore, when the Public Works Department approved the company's price increase, it was attached with the condition that if the price of silver in Shanghai rose to about 2 shillings, the price increase should be reconsidered. Your association suggested that the company use the security deposit stored in the (average share price) and (revised budget) to make up for the deficit. The company is difficult to implement because there is no surplus in the (revised budget). It can be understood after reviewing the recently published accounts. The (average share price) was also considered before the company passed the price increase proposal. The revenue of tap water has increased with the soaring rent in recent years, as your association said. However, since the city adopted the Gregorian calendar, the company no longer has the unexpected income of leap months, and the consumption of users is also increasing day by day. It is expected that this year's consumption will be twice as high as in the past. The raw material of tap water is indeed the water of the Huangpu River. However, it takes a lot of expensive projects and equipment to draw the water, filter it, and make it usable for users. The water of the Huangpu River can be used without spending a penny, but the cost of the drawing projects and equipment is increasing day by day. The directors of the company hope that your association can send several representatives to visit the company's water intake pool in Yangshupu, so that your association may believe that the company's words are true. Although the installation of branch pipes is funded by the owners, the cost of daily maintenance of the pipes is still borne by the company. The contract signed between the company and the Public Works Department in 1928 stated in detail that the water price can be revised at any time (with the consent of both parties). So, how has the company violated the contract? Moreover, the current water price is based on the exchange rate of 2 shillings and 5 pence. Now the exchange rate has suddenly fallen to 1 shilling and 7 pence. How can the company not increase it to maintain the needs of the public in Shanghai? If your association considers this point in detail, it may also recognize that the company's price increase is reasonable. If your association's representatives can take the time to visit the company's Yangshupu factory, the company will sincerely welcome them to explain everything in person. This is addressed to the Shanghai Real Estate Association, Shanghai Water Company Secretary Hua De respectfully replied.</p>

<h3>Flour Begins to Be Transported North</h3>
<p>Northern Inspection of Merchant Ships</p>
<p>Flour Transported to Tianjin: Since the Shanghai Jianghai Customs prohibited the transport of flour to North China, foreign flour has taken the opportunity to enter. The number of American wheat flour shipped to Beiyang has increased day by day. Flour mills in Shanghai requested the Ministry of Finance to lift the ban on the transport of wheat flour to North China for business reasons, in order to maintain the people's food supply and resist the import of foreign flour. This matter has been discussed for a long time. The Ministry of Finance has now accepted the request of the flour mills and approved the lifting of the ban. The flour mills have publicly recognized the purchase of 1 million in public bonds. Recently, the mills have been in contact with various shipping companies to handle transportation procedures. According to the Shanghai shipping price for wheat flour to Tianjin, it is fixed at 4.2 cents per bag. After the actual receipt of 1.89 cents, foreign merchants competed to drop the price to 9 cents per bag. Due to this rate of loss being too large, the transportation companies have proposed a public discussion and resolved to increase it to 1.1 cents per bag. Yesterday, a British ship in the port began to load flour to Tianjin. This is the first batch after the ban was lifted. In recent days, British and Japanese ships have been competing fiercely to solicit this northward transport of wheat flour.</p>
<p>Inspection of Merchant Ships: There are thirteen regular ships from five companies in Shanghai to Beiyang: Taikoo, Ewo, Nisshin, Osaka Shosen, and Zhaoshang, all of which reach Tianjin Baihe and even Zizhu Lin. Recently, after the defeat of the Northern Army, Tianjin has been very vigilant and pays special attention to ships going south. The Tianjin Customs has recently dispatched inspectors to search merchant ships. When ships from Shanghai to Tianjin sail to Tanggu Port, the inspectors take small boats to Dazhan to wait for the ships. They board the ships to search, especially carefully inspecting passengers traveling south and thoroughly inspecting luggage and items, causing great annoyance to passengers. Recently, British and Japanese ships have raised serious protests, saying that it hinders their business.</p>
<h3>Li Was a Confidant of Wang Jingwei</h3>
<p>Li was a confidant of Wang Jingwei in Peiping. This time, he was dispatched by Wang to Shanghai to take on some important work. After his travel expenses ran out, he conceived a robbery. Li was the mastermind behind this case. After the robbery, they gathered at Li's residence at No. 66 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. Li distributed 2,000 yuan to him. The next day, he went to Li's residence again. Li's wife told him that Li had returned to Peiping. He rushed to Fengtian (Mukden) to meet Li and decided to go north together. Li gave him another 220 yuan to buy a boat ticket, telling him not to implicate others and to find a way to rescue him.</p>
<p>When they were about to pass Dagu, Li said that there must be detectives guarding the Dagu port, and he should quickly shave his beard and remove his gold teeth to avoid attracting attention. He had to shave his beard, and Li helped him pull out his teeth, and told him that if he was still caught, don't implicate others, and Li promised to find a way to rescue him. That's why he didn't say Li's real name when he was arrested and said that he had never known him. He was following Li's instructions. Now that Li is with Wang Jingwei in Peiping, he can lead the way to arrest him, etc. The Tianjin police finally realized it, but they had already released him and could not arrest him. The Tianjin local authorities requested extradition.</p>
<p>When we received the warrant from your court and arrived in Tianjin, the Chinese authorities there were negotiating with the Tianjin Municipal Council to request the extradition of Zhu. This must be the result of Li's finding a way to help Zhu after returning to Peiping. If Zhu is handed over to the Chinese officials, he will definitely be released because the Chinese authorities there do not recognize the warrant from your court that we showed them. The Tianjin Municipal Council handed Zhu directly over to us without going through the Chinese territory and directly boarded the ship to escort him back. Along the way, the photos of those related to this case were shown to Zhu. Zhu gave a detailed confession about the process of the case and the degree of involvement of each defendant in the case. Then, the confession was submitted to the court for investigation to determine whether Zhu Desheng was the ringleader of the robbery.</p>
<p>According to the interrogation by Judge Zhou, Zhu the thief confessed that he was in the countryside this year when he was summoned to Shanghai by his friend Gao Guowei, who promised to introduce him to a job. When he arrived in Shanghai, Gao introduced him to Li Zuquan. Li asked him to recruit several guards, so he asked Liang Houbiao to recommend him to Sheng, who recommended Wang E, He Guo, Wang Yang, etc. At first, he didn't know that Li had gathered people to plan the robbery. When the robbery was taking place, he was sitting in a rickshaw watching from a distance. The rest of his confession was similar to what the Western detectives reported, but he denied being the ringleader. Wang E claimed that Zhu was indeed the leader.</p>
<p>During the next interrogation, Wang E confessed that Zhu Desheng was indeed the ringleader. Before the robbery, Zhu asked Liang Houbiao to invite me to a hotel to discuss and decided that Zhu, Wang Yang, He Guo, and the two who are at large, Ma and Su, together with me, would go to rob. Afterwards, we went to a garden on Jin Shenfu Road to divide the loot. I got 1,650 yuan. Wang Yang got the same amount. Sheng Cheng only got 500 yuan as an introduction fee. We only knew that Zhu was the leader, and we didn't know there was a Mr. Li. The rest of the thieves' confessions were very vague.</p>
<p>During another interrogation, He Guo confessed that he was introduced to Zhu by Liang to be a guard. When the robbery took place, Zhu ordered me to go with him and gave me a pistol. At first, I didn't want to go, but Zhu shot at me, and the scar on my face is still there. I had to follow him and listen to his commands. Afterwards, Zhu gave me 1,000 yuan. Wang Yang also confessed that although he was in the same gang as them, he was not at the scene during the robbery. The rest of his words were evasive. In addition, although Liang Houbiao and other male and female defendants were interrogated one by one, their confessions were ambiguous. Wang and Wang were bandits who committed a kidnapping in Jiaxing.</p>
<p>The victim of the robbery, Wang Fuchang, hired a lawyer to represent him and requested a thorough investigation. Huan Guanlin, the chief detective of the Jiaxing County Government, did not appear in court, stating that Wang E and Wang Yang had committed a kidnapping case in Jiaxing, and the ransom was still missing. He requested that the two bandits be temporarily taken back to Jiaxing for one week to investigate the whereabouts of the ransom. The family members of the ransom victim also hired a lawyer to help them request the transfer. Judge Zhou then ordered that Wang E and Wang Yang be temporarily taken away by the Jiaxing Court for investigation and sent back within a week. He Xu Shi was released on bail, and the rest of the male and female defendants were returned to prison to be investigated and interrogated again in fourteen days.</p>
<p>Tangjiawan Fire Tragedy</p>
<p>Pan A’xin’s Carelessness Causes Great Disaster</p>
<p>Chen Guobao’s Whole Family Loses Three Lives</p>
<p>At 10:15 yesterday morning, a sudden fire broke out at No. 71 Tangjiawan Road in the Nanshi area. Four municipal houses were destroyed, two girls and one woman were burned to death, and one boy fell from the building and broke his leg. The situation was extremely tragic, and the spread of the fire was unusually peculiar, with the fire crossing the road for more than two zhang. The details of the time will be recorded later.</p>
<p>Pan's Family Members:</p>
<p>Tangjiawan Road in Nanshi belongs to the jurisdiction of the Second District General Office of the Public Security Bureau in the Chinese territory, and the French Concession is nearby. The landlord of No. 71 is Pan A'xin (50 years old) from Zhejiang, who has been running a teahouse. Pan's wife, Zhang (35 years old), along with their two sons, A Mao (19 years old) and A Bao (4 years old), and two daughters, Xiu Ying (13 years old) and Xiao Bao (2 years old), a family of six, live in the front building of the house.</p>
<p>Tenants:</p>
<p>In addition to Pan's family living in the front building, the back building is rented to Chen Guobao (42 years old), a barber from Yangzhou, and his wife, Xu (38 years old). They have three sons and two daughters: the eldest son, Da Dong, is 17 years old, the second son, Er Dong, is 15 years old, and the third son, San Dong, is 11 years old. The fourth daughter, nicknamed Lao Hu, is 6 years old, and the fifth daughter, Xiao Long, is only 4 years old. The pavilion room is rented to Feng Zigui (42 years old), who sells fruit and runs Yang Fu Ji Woodworking.</p>
<p>Lack of Water for Firefighting:</p>
<p>At 10:15 yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the downstairs of the house due to carelessness in cooking lunch. The fire brigades from Nanshi heard the alarm and rushed to the rescue, but the water supply in the area was weak, and the water pressure was less than one zhang, making it impossible to put out the fire. Fortunately, the nearby French Concession temporarily borrowed tap water for use, but in the meantime, the fire had crossed the road. By the time it was completely extinguished at 11:00 noon, four stores had been destroyed.</p>
<p>Neighboring Damage:</p>
<p>After No. 71 was completely destroyed, the first to suffer was the clothing store at No. 69 next door. There were nine households living in the store, all workers and hawkers. Before long, the flames crossed the road for more than two zhang and spread to Xu Longxing Noodle Shop at No. 72, owned by Xu Jingou (35 years old, from Chongming), and Renji Rickshaw Company at No. 74. None of the households were insured, and the estimated loss was about 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Mrs. Xu Flees for Her Life:</p>
<p>It is said that the fire at No. 71 started behind the downstairs handrail, so the handrail was burned first. Most of the residents upstairs escaped through the windows or sun deck, but Chen Guobao in the back building was working in the store. Only Chen Xu and his third son, San Dong, and two young daughters, Lao Hu and Xiao Long, were at home. Mrs. Xu saw that the stairs were broken and there was no way to escape, so she urgently led San Dong to jump from the front building window.</p>
<p>Death and Injury:</p>
<p>When Mrs. Xu jumped down, her head hit the ground first, and her brains splattered. San Dong broke his leg and was taken to the hospital by ambulance. Mrs. Xu died on the way due to serious injuries. San Dong's life may be saved, but he may be disabled. It is said that Mrs. Xu was also six months pregnant. Fortunately, the two eldest sons were studying hairdressing outside, otherwise they would have suffered the same disaster.</p>
<p>Two Young Girls' Corpses:</p>
<p>When the fire was raging, it was extremely chaotic, and the number of people could not be counted. After it was completely extinguished, two girls' corpses were found in the back building, which were the two young daughters of Mrs. Xu, Lao Hu and Xiao Long. Their bodies were charred beyond recognition. The Second District General Office ordered a senior police officer to conduct a detailed investigation and first arrested the fire starter, Yang Yunlou, and then ordered the local bailiff to report to the court for inspection. Until last night, the corpses of the two children were still lying on the road, and the scene was like the completion ceremony of the National Martial Arts Hall martial arts competition.</p>
<p>The construction of the Central National Martial Arts Hall Competition Ground has been completed. The completion ceremony will be held at 2 pm on the 17th. The interior can accommodate more than 1,000 people. The magnificent new building will add glory to the future of national martial arts. In the past few days, dozens of people have gone to Beijing from Shanghai to participate in the ceremony. It is said that the hall has invited people from all walks of life in the party, government, military, and academia to visit. It has received many congratulatory gifts. It is said that the hall has appointed Li Zimao as the general commander of the venue, Weng Guoxun, Wang Weifan, Chen Weiping, and Nie Yurun to entertain special guests, Guo Xisan and others to entertain military and political figures, Chen Jiazhen to entertain the press, Lan Fengsan and others to entertain academics, and Li Chengbin and others to entertain other guests. Director Zhang is the chief judge, Tang Fansheng is the judge, and Zhu Guofu is the competition committee member. In addition to the ceremony, martial arts competitions will be held to live up to the name of martial arts competition. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<p>Timing of Water Cutoff at Xinde Fang Leads to Dispute</p>
<p>Tenants Want Water All Day</p>
<p>Landlords Want to Charge Extra for Water</p>
<p>Authorities Decide Based on Majority</p>
<p>Xinde Fang on Qiujiang Road in Zhabei has 50 houses. Originally, the water fee was included in the rent. Since the installation of water meters, the landlords, in order to control water waste, stipulated that water would be supplied from 7:30 am to 12:00 pm and from 5:00 pm to 6:00 pm. Later, the tenants requested water all day because it was inconvenient to drink. The landlords issued a notice in August of this year that an additional water fee of 1.5 yuan per month per room would be charged for water all day. After one month, only eight families paid the fee, and the rest refused to do so. Therefore, the timing of the water cutoff was restored. Tenant Tang Mengwu filed a complaint with the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, requesting that the supply of water be restored all day. The bureau summoned both parties to inquire about the situation and observed that the tenants could tolerate the additional water fee, so it instructed the accounting office of the fang to consult each tenant for their opinions and then make a decision based on the majority.</p>
<p>Restructuring of the National Products Market</p>
<p>Business as Usual During the Restructuring Period</p>
<p>Since the Chinese National Products United Market decided to change its organization and plan, internal facilities will also be changed. The most important thing is to rearrange the shops in the market. New drawings have already been completed and are being printed. They will be announced to the public soon. The location of all obstacles and routes has been removed. However, in order to facilitate the purchase of national products by all sectors, business will continue as usual during this restructuring period. Due to changes in location, changes or mergers of businesses or rearrangements of businesses will inevitably occur for the participating manufacturers. It will be completed by the beginning of the first ten days of the month. In order to promote local products from all over the country, the market welcomes merchants from all over the country to join with special local products. Merchants from Sichuan, Anhui, Zhejiang, and other provinces have already contacted the market. The market hopes that people from all provinces in Shanghai will work hard to collect local products from their provinces and join as much as possible to facilitate sales. Therefore, a part of the future plan will be for national product factory products, and a part will be for local products from all over the country to meet the needs of society. Therefore, both foreign factories and local product merchants can contact the market to visit and learn about the methods.</p>
<p>Li Mingqing is the King of Swindlers</p>
<p>Well-Planned, Getting Both Money and Women</p>
<p>Wu Kunda from Haimen opened a fishing net shop on Zhongxing Road in Zhabei. His wife, Jing Abao, was 24 years old and had a pretty appearance, but she was very promiscuous. She became acquainted with Li Mingqing, who opened a fishing net shop next door, and their love grew stronger. She wanted to elope, but she had no money. Li was skilled in scheming, so he falsely set up a candy shop on Harbin Road and bought goods on credit from various upper-level companies for several hundred yuan. Then, he resold them to others. Therefore, his shop was only open for six days, and he closed it on the 7th of this month and went to seduce Wu's wife to elope with him. After the elopement, the upper-level companies' payments were not settled and they were investigating. Wu Kunda was also looking for his wife after losing her. Ou Jialu, the owner of Shen Yuanchang Candy Shop, who was defrauded, learned that Li had opened a fishing net shop on Zhongxing Road, so he went to inquire. He and Wu Kunda talked to each other and agreed. They joined forces to find out that Li Mingqing had defrauded money and a beautiful wife and was hiding in the Dacheng Hotel on Jielu. Wu Zhang reported to the police station and arrested Li Mingqing and Jing Abao. Because the case was committed in the mainland, they were transferred to the Third Division of the Fifth District for interrogation. Li Mingqing's abduction of money and people was indeed the king of abductors. His scheming was very thorough and he was an experienced old hand. Therefore, he was transferred to the local court yesterday for punishment.</p>
<p>Women Disappear Again and Again</p>
<p>Both Sides Are Looking for Their People</p>
<p>The Dispute Is Just Beginning</p>
<p>Lu Chen, a woman from Qiaojia Qigan in Sanlintang, Pudong, about six miles south of the town, had a daughter, Lu, who was 20 years old this year. She was betrothed to Wu Anan, the son of Wu Qiao, who lived nearby, as his wife when she was young. She married in June of the year before last. However, the Wu family only knew how to accumulate wealth and did not understand the tenderness of a newlywed couple. Every morning, they forced the new bride to carry vegetables to Puxi to earn a meager profit. The new bride resented this and because she was trading in the Shanghai vegetable market every day where people from all walks of life gathered, she was easily seduced by Dai Xiaoxizi, a Jiangbei gangster, into adultery. After a long time, Dai ordered her to go to his home in Tanzi Kou, Zhabei, to live as his wife. They were quite happy. Unexpectedly, good things don't last long. On August 13th of last year, Dai Xiaoxizi died of illness. Dai's uncle then entrusted Chen Zhu and Chen Zhang, two women living in Lujiabang, South Wharf, to act as matchmakers to sell her to Zhao Yuqin in Lan Nidu, Pudong, as his wife for 45 yuan. It has been two years now. In their hometown, the two in-laws were chasing each other for the woman and could not resolve the dispute. In May of this year, Lu Chen went to Shanghai to sell vegetables and met her daughter. She forced her to go with her and sent her back to live in the Wu family for three months. Then, the Wu family ordered her to go out to sell vegetables again. The day before yesterday, Chen Zhu and Chen Zhang saw her in the South Wharf vegetable market. Because Zhao was chasing after her, they forced her back to their home and detained her to prevent her from taking her to Zhao. After Lu Chen and Wu Qiao lost their daughter and daughter-in-law, they knew that there had been a change. Because their daughter had said that Chen Zhu and others were matchmakers, they went to find her. Sure enough, she was inside, so they reported to the police and arrested the two "ant matchmakers" and the daughter and escorted them to the First Division of the First District and ordered them to be sent to the local court for interrogation.</p>
<p>Xu Zhaodi Falls into a Brothel and Then Jumps Out</p>
<p>Xu Zhaodi, a woman from Wuxi who owned Xu Yongxing Paint Shop on South Zhonghua Road in Ximen, was just over twenty years old and had a pretty face, but her complexion was a little dark. Because her biological mother died, she was raised by her stepmother, Zhu. They got along well. Recently, because the family's financial situation declined and her old father passed away one after another, life was difficult. Gan Lu, also known as Lu Xiuzhen, who was acquainted with her, and Jin Wang, also known as Yan Mei, who was a procuress at the Yaoji Brothel on Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession, used the fact that Zhaodi was at the age of marriage and it was a pity to entice her stepmother, Xu Zhu. Instead of working so hard, it would be better to rent Zhaodi to Yu Cuie, who used to sell white orchids and now runs a Yaoji Brothel, as a partner to entertain guests and earn rent. Zhaodi's stepmother was tempted, so she discussed it with Zhaodi and agreed to send Xu Zhaodi to the Yaoji Brothel opened by Yu Cuie on the 15th of last month. They got 160 yuan in rent. Xu Zhu got 90 yuan, and Gan Lu and Jin Wang each got 16 yuan. Zhaodi used 38 yuan for herself. Since then, Zhaodi has been practicing in the brothel and has not yet received guests. Her uncle, Lu Pan Gen, and aunt, Zhu Lu, found out about this yesterday and went to Xu Zhaodi's stepmother, Xu Zhu, to argue that she should not sell Zhaodi into prostitution and engage in this flesh trade. While they were arguing, the brothel instigated hooligans to intervene. Wang Congyuan, the 14th guard of the Second Division of the Second District, learned about the situation and, on the grounds that she should not force a good woman into prostitution, took all the witnesses to the station. After questioning by Director Guo, although Xu Zhaodi and her stepmother, Xu Zhu, both wanted to be prostitutes, it was against the current criminal law and violated the Party's equality between men and women and should not be destroyed and thrown into a brothel. He ordered Xu Zhaodi to be taken back by her aunt, Zhu Lu, and the 160 yuan to be borne by Xu Zhu, Gan Lu, and Jin Wang. They were still short of 38 yuan, which Lu Pan Gen, the uncle, would find a way to supplement to help her get married.</p>

<h3>Cross-Border Electricity Connection Negotiations</h3>
<p>Chinese Constables in the Interior Have Been Withdrawn</p>
<p>Recently, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities dispatched workers to erect electric poles and wires on Zhongshan Road in West Shanghai. This project passed through the Hongqiao Road, which was built beyond the border. The British Municipal Council dispatched armed Chinese constables to stop the work in the Daxilu and Hongqiao Road areas. After the Sixth District, Second Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Daxilu Police Station, Officer Wang, and Hongqiao Road Officer Li, learned that the land belonged to the Chinese territory, they questioned how the police station could overstep its authority. Therefore, they led police officers to inquire with the constables. They said they were ordered to prevent the installation of Chinese merchant's electric wires passing through Daxilu, etc. Officers Wang and Li reported this to their chief. Chief Liu personally went to investigate and then went to the Jing'an Temple Police Station to seriously negotiate with the head constable, stating that Hongqiao Road and Daxilu were built beyond the border and foreigners should not interfere with any construction. It was inappropriate for the Municipal Council to dispatch constables to prevent the installation of electric wires. For the sake of diplomatic relations, the constables dispatched to both roads should be withdrawn as soon as possible to avoid misunderstandings, otherwise, I (Chief Liu referring to himself) would exercise my authority to disarm the dispatched constables, arrest them, and send them to the bureau for higher authorities to handle. After Chief Liu repeatedly negotiated and argued with the constables, they finally agreed to withdraw. Therefore, the constables dispatched to both roads were withdrawn yesterday.</p>
<h3>Zhang Renkui Has Nothing to Do with the Ma Case</h3>
<p>Zhang Renkui, the former garrison commander of Tonghai, has been living in Shanghai since his retirement, and because he feels old, he does not concern himself with external affairs. Unexpectedly, Zhang was also implicated in the previous national government's wanted case of Ma Yuren, but recently the central government has found that Zhang had nothing to do with the Ma case and</p>
<p>Telegraphed Commander Xiong to Notify</p>
<h3>Tragic Disaster in Taian, Shandong After the War</h3>
<p>Report Received by the Jisheng Society</p>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society recently received reports from twenty legal entities, including the Taian Red Swastika Society, stating that Taian, Shandong, is a place with barren land and impoverished people, coupled with years of locust plagues. The households lack storage, and the population is dense. Usually, they need to buy firewood and rice to make a living. After the city was closed, the water supply was cut off first, and the fuel was immediately exhausted. The people became pale. The suffering of the food supply was already unbearable, and the attack by artillery fire was even more severe. Airplanes came from afar and bombs struck nearby. Walls collapsed and houses crumbled, blood flowed across the ground, and the dead were not cared for. Many soldiers hid in the ground to eat, and the people were exposed under thatched roofs. The number of casualties from each bombing was incalculable. When the landmine exploded, the city walls collapsed, huge rocks flew into the sky, and grease and blood soaked the ground. Feet were found among the tiles, and broken arms were found in the ditches. Crops cannot be harvested, and there is no money to buy firewood and rice. As the saying goes, there is bound to be a year of famine after a major war. Alas, we, the survivors, have suffered such a rare catastrophe since ancient times. Our souls are still in shock, and famine is imminent. The dead have no coffins, and the living lack clothing and food, no house to live in, and no place to escape. Wailing echoes in the wilderness, and dry throats eagerly await the Western River. We implore your esteemed society to show compassion and universal relief, and to provide emergency assistance. We humbly accept your kindness and await your orders. The society has previously handled disaster relief work for the Shu River project in Shandong, the relief for the Yan Yao warehouse disaster in Jinan, and now it is also transporting relief supplies to Qufu for the disaster and epidemic. The previous reports detailed the extreme suffering in Taian due to famine and war. The refugees have not yet gathered, and the aftermath needs to be planned. The tragic situation is unbearable to read, and my heart is burning with anxiety. All my compatriots are shocked by what they see. With the benevolent spirit of giving and resolving, we can alleviate the urgency of the disaster and take advantage of the opportunity to create blessings. Why not start now?</p>

<h3>Hundred Thousand Yuan Robbery Case - The Contents Are Quite Peculiar</h3>
<p>The Thief Zhu Dexin, Escorted Back from Tianjin</p>
<p>Said to Be Related to Wang Jingwei's Representative</p>
<p>Shaved His Beard and Pulled Out His Teeth But Was Eventually Captured</p>
<p>Wang E and Wang Yang Are Approved to Be Transferred to Jiaxing</p>
<p>The case of the 100,000 yuan robbery of the Zhejiang Provincial Bank in Hangzhou has been reported in detail in the newspapers. The detectives who were dispatched to Tianjin to transfer the main suspect, Zhu Dexin (also known as Zhu Dexinsheng and Zhu Cheng), have escorted him back to Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon, along with Liang Houbiao, Sheng Cheng, Wang E, Wang Yang, Liang Dingyi, He Guo, He Xiangquan, and the women Hua Wangshi, Liang Lvshi, and He Xushi, who were arrested in Shanghai, they were all transferred to the Special District Court. Presiding Judge Zhou Hanting and Prosecutor Xu also attended the court to perform their duties. After the police lawyer Ru Bao-yi stated the facts of the case, Western Detective Wheelcox reported the circumstances of the transfer of the Zhu thief to Tianjin, as follows:</p>
<h3>Strictly Investigate Those with Beards and Gold Teeth</h3>
<p>After the police captured Liang Houbiao and others, Liang confessed that Zhu was the leader of the case, and that he had taken the Fengtian ship to Tianjin on August 30. He also described Zhu's appearance, stating that he had a beard and gold teeth. The police then telegraphed the Tianjin Municipal Council based on the above confession, requesting that passengers be carefully checked when the ship arrives, and that those with beards and gold teeth be strictly investigated. The Tianjin Municipal Council received the telegram and, fearing that it would be difficult to check the passengers when the ship arrived, sent an officer to meet the ship at Dagukou. After the ship arrived there, the officer boarded the ship and searched everywhere, but there were no passengers with the above-mentioned appearance.</p>
<h3>The Beard Has Been Removed and the Teeth Have Been Pulled Out</h3>
<p>Just as they were hesitating, another passenger named Xiong Jiandong reported to the searchers that he had seen a passenger shave his beard and pull out his gold teeth the night before. He led the searchers to the engine room and arrested the person who had shaved his beard and pulled out his teeth. After questioning, they learned that he was Zhu Dexin.</p>
<h3>Xiong Jiandong Is Actually Li Zuquan</h3>
<p>The Zhu thief tried to bribe a searcher surnamed Chen with cash, hoping to be released, and was willing to pay an additional 600 yuan after arriving in Tianjin. The searcher refused. When the ship arrived in Tianjin, Zhu, Xiong Jiandong, and their luggage were taken to the Tianjin Municipal Council's police station. Zhu initially denied being a thief and said that he did not know Xiong. After the Tianjin police checked Xiong's luggage, they did not find any contraband, so they released Xiong. The next day, the Zhu thief suddenly claimed that the person released yesterday was not Xiong Jiandong, but his gang leader, Li Zuquan.</p>
