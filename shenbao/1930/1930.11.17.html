<p>對華親善。亦爲濱口上台時宣布施政方針之一。蓋自田中内閣實行積極政策而後。中日關係。日趨險惡。迨至日本出兵山東。愈招中國人反感。故其在華之商業經濟利益。遂受莫大打擊。濱口繼任。覺悟田中内閣對華之失策。乃以對華親善爲標榜。擢用意旨相同之幣原爲外相。以確立對華外交之方針。雖其實際上傳统政策。無稍改變而因其手段較前緩和。挽回華人之情感不少。此亦爲濱口博得其國内民衆同情之一。然而此種親善。僅以揣摹利益爲基礎。而不以國際平等爲原則。以故每遇外交。終有格不相入之虞。欲實行親善。非根本上有所改革不可也。永井外次遊華回國。今日發表感想。謂今後對華。應捨棄向來威嚇迎合政策。而易以理解情意。以謀兩國福利。永井氏徧歷我國南北。諳悉我國國情。故其所言。較爲切實。蓋威嚇爲田中政策。迎合爲現内閣政策。均非外交正軌。現内閣因濱口被刺。已令幣原外相兼攝。外交政策。然無所變更。惟常此空言親善。而不於事實上表示一二眞正親善之實據。使我民認識日本對華之誠意。則中日間之隔閡。終不能除。此則有待於今後日政府之努力矣。</p>
<p>雖然。幣原之兼攝内閣民政黨以其屬於中立派。恐不足勝應付敵黨之任故尙表示不滿。且安達與江木兩派。又正自相競爭。國會開會之日。必與敵黨更有一。番大爭執。政局將起何種變化。任何人不能預測。然則今日又安暇談外交哉。</p>

<p>首相代理幣原徼幸拾得　江木安達兩派暗鬭結果</p>
<p>▲日聯十六日東京電濱口首相昨晚病勢一時惡化、即昨日傍晚値班看護婦忽由病室出來、對隣室眞鍋主治醫低聲報告首相狀態、眞鍋狀甚驚駭、即入病室與鹽田博士詳細診察、旋除兩醫師及夏子夫人兩子女外、全部退出病室、慰問首相之各大臣等、亦在隔室等候發表、至九時中島戶田兩秘書愼重協議結果、遂於十時發表首相病狀、可知當時病勢有重大變化、病室内外空氣一時頗形緊張、鹽田博士昨晚十一時對記者曰、今晚六時診察時、胸部略有不良徵候、此種現象愈多則極危險、體温最高、呼吸與脈膊不亂則可樂觀、現在腹内瓦斯尙未洩出、九時半注射睡藥一次、</p>
<p>▲日聯十六日東京電鹽田博士發表濱口首相病勢如左、十六日晨八時洗滌胃口、浣出帶有膽汁胃腋、似頗見安適、此狀態再繼續二三日、不發生瓦斯當可無虞云云、上午九時脈博九十五、體温三十七度六、呼吸十五、正午體温三十七度五、脈搏九十七、呼吸十八、</p>
<p>▲電通十六日東京電幣原外相之任臨　時首相、固由於宇垣陸相抱病當然結果、但裏幕尙有内閣部内及與黨方面複雜關係、蓋由羣雄各不相讓、因而推舉中立之幣原、幣原之任此、亦可謂爲拾得者、民政黨内現有安達派與江木派之暗鬭頗烈、安達於總選舉、甚占勢力、江木鐵相則爲濱口首相之智囊、亦擁有不可侮之勢力、兩者無論誰任首相代理、皆足使黨中動搖、當濱口首相遇刺當夜、兩派暗中活動頗爲激烈、江木鐵相見此情狀、立以電光石火之迅捷手段、言於濱口首相、並邀宇垣陸相諒解、又先得幣原内諾、遂於閣議親自提議、推舉幣原、不待幣原之可否、即推爲臨時首相、内幕如此、故幣原之代理、祗屬暫時、濱口首相若病臥稍需時日、自經再加以政治的考慮、尤以議會開院迫在目前、尤使幣原不安、至江木派又將出何奇策、殊無從捉摸、安達派神經正爲之緊張、</p>
<p>▲電通十六日東京電濱口首相傷勢、經過雖極順調、惟全愈尙須相當時日、而議會召集之期祇餘一個月半、倘濱口首相不能親臨議會、野黨攻擊、將集中於幣原兼攝首相、與與黨及其他各項連絡、對付議會、頗慮發生隔膜、因之民政黨内對幣原臨時首相、頗多懷不滿、有主推出黨出身閣員、代攝首相缺、以謀整飭陣容者、此主張若成爲具體的進展、黨内勢力關係、將引起糾紛、刻此空氣將進展至何程度、頗可注目、</p>

<p>（東京通訉）最近日本舉行第九回全國網球錦標比賽、全國網球界稍有位置的老將與後起之秀加入角逐者凡四十餘人、台維士杯選手中單打的原因與太田因事未能加入、而擔任台杯雙打的佐藤俵特告奮勇、加入單打、並與原配手安部參加雙打、</p>
<p>單打中最有希望的自然是老將佐藤俵、遠東代表的佐藤布井、和曾一次打敗佐藤的　口四人、經過多次的淘汰、最後留下兩佐藤於十日舉行决勝戰、結果小佐藤（在遠東大會戰敗林邱者竟以六對四、八對六、六對二直落三征服了新回國的台杯選手老佐藤、老佐藤開球頗見功夫、落球的地位亦甚好、且能以不慌不忙的態度制勝、惜表演未能盡技、小佐藤則實力雄厚、奔馳如意、追救險球、尤具本領、屢於敵方無意之中將險球擊回、使敵莫知所措、若能於鎭靜上再加注意、則前途未可限量也、</p>
<p>雙打方面、除佐藤（大）安部組及出席遠東大會之山岸志村組外、以佐藤（小）與川地組最有希望、不謂事出意表、在複賽中佐藤安部組即被不甚聞名之神戶商大布井桑原組戰敗、後者並一帆風順、得與山岸志村、組作錦標之爭抗、山岸志村爲多年的配搭、連絡功夫、純熟非常、致敵方無𨻶可乘、布井原以單打見稱、個人技術上表演至佳、惜桑原屢與敵人以可乘之機、並爲敵人進攻之的、終至敗北結果爲四比六、六比四、六比三、六比四、</p>
<p>記者按日本網球界進步極速、新將輩出、大有日新月異之勢、甚望我國選手努力加功、庶下届遠東大會得與彼輩爭雄也、</p>

<p>— 黃寄萍</p>
<p>曩年余作客閩厦時。識名飛機師二。一爲陳文麟氏。一即李逢煊氏。陳留德多年。去春駕厦門號飛機。由歐返國。計程五萬餘里。首開華人長途飛行之紀錄。海軍當局遂畀以厦航空處長要職。李早歲留美。精飛行術。歸任粵省機師。民十五隨軍北伐。迭建奇功。及五三案起。旅菲閩僑憤倭人之猖獗。思所以報國救民之道。乃在厦倡航空學校。爲國儲才。聘李氏任敎練。陳李二氏俱厦籍。又同爲桑梓服務。故閩人幾無不知有此二傑也。二君爲總角交。與余一見如故。相見恨晚。暇日嘗相偕作郊外遊。暢叙衷曲。縱論古今。交稱莫逆。</p>
<p>客臘余離厦還籍。臨行諸友送别。陳執手曰。明日將有閩城之行。君先余一日而去。得賦驪歌一曲。否則必相左。惜逢煊兄有事漳龍。凌空駕馭。努力勦共。知君之行。囑余進一言以表惜别之意。余曰。此公誠多情也。相與一笑而别。今春余有事滬上。南游作罷。天涯地角。雖不復能如昔日之歡叙。然魚雁往還。亦殊足以解懷。前月李自粵中貽書。歷述今秋厦校歸併粵航空校及擢升主任敎官之經過。謂每日敎練生徒。騰雲駕霧。意興勝於疇昔。且云軍令已頒。不日出航征桂。殲滅叛逆。俟凱旋後再爲詳盡之報告。其依依之情。溢於字裏行間。方慶此君長才多藝。年少有爲。何期噩耗傳來。李君竟於本月四日晨遇險於羊城之大沙頭河面。余初猶未信。迨接粵友快函。詳述斯事。證之報載。乃大澈悟。吁。斯人而遭斯遇。可謂非常之人。遭非常之災。其慘酷爲何如耶。</p>
<p>余據函中所述。知此次遇險。係機件之障故。而非技術之不精。蓋其所駕之機。爲「亞非英」第六號。即厦校撥歸粵校者。李君平時即駕駛此機。於該機之運用。極稱諳熟。豈知飛至二千尺高度時。馬達突然損壞。而機尾鋼絲同時震斷。致無法推進。旋轉下墮。遭此慘禍。是李君之死。亦天命所歸歟。據事後察騐。李君與同難之劉泉。身被皮帶緊縛機中。故機沉海底。而身難解脫。假令於遇險之初。不備此帶。則浮泳生還。亦意中事。倘亦李君於驚慌之際。未之措意耳。尤可痛者。該機下沉後。一時無法取出。僱漁船四艘。協同軍用電艇。用網打撈。越兩小時始將機撈起。機件未大損。而屍體已轉色發脹。五官流血。爲狀之慘。不忍目睹。</p>
<p>李君性亢直。處事有毅力。勞怨所勿辭。亦朋儕中之難得者。年僅三十有五歲</p>
<h3 id="c190">記市小第三次運動會 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 葉華女士</p>
<p>邇來全國最大之會。莫過於四中全會。而上海最大之會則莫過於市小第三届聯合運動會。一爲國家大事。一爲小學生大事。兩會僉於總理誕辰開幕。可謂遙遙相對。論人數之多。情况之盛。則後者實勝前者。惟性質不同耳。市小運動。一年一度。記者每得參與。何幸如之。歷届花絮。曾誌本談。今再續陳於左。</p>
<p>▲今昔之比較　上海市小學聯合之運動。始自民十七秋韋捧丹長局王祖廉長二科時。大會會長即局長充任。第二届仍之。惟局長已易陳待秋主管科長爲倪文亞矣。此次會長。又更爲徐君陶。科長係鄭果齋。滬敎育界領袖。一年一度一更調。當其致開會詞時。令人感想萬千。該會用費。首届千元。二届九百元。本届七百元。效率與經費固不成正比例也。學校前歲加入者六十四。去歲六十二。今則市校六十一。私校二十三。最可觀之大會操。人數第一次三千七百十四。二次。四千四百四十五。此次計四千五百十六。觀衆較前勝一倍。每日逾二萬。兩江女體專以參觀該會。竟停學三天。可見其盛况。有過之無不及也。</p>
<p>▲會塲一瞥　主席台向南一如舊觀。較昔無變化。中掛運動會字樣匾額。旁懸「振作精神。看三日中誰是體育眞實之成績。繼續鍜鍊。期十年後共爲我中華武健的國民」一聯。跑道在北。各校席次。預爲排定。宛若鴿箱。圍繞塲之四周。其𨻶地引吭高喊之小販攤蝟集焉。席次雖已排定。然而鵲巢鳩占。見諸事實。體育重秩序與紀律。至此恐遺忘矣。休息處男女分居。羣兒憩息其間。無異一幅流民圖。若輩興趣之濃。非成人所能望其項背。念白居易詩「二十始長成。三十向衰老。鏡中桃李色。不得十年好。」對此益增感慨。</p>
<p>▲方桌爲圓椅復讐　會操前。衆學生雁行而立。唱黨歌及運動會歌。例請仲子通指揮。仲君立於三桌搭成之台。口唱手指。十分有勁。歌畢。洋洋意得。由台躍至桌。前圓椅。詎以體胖身重。椅致粉碎。觀者於緊張空氣中驚喜交集。迨王懷祺再行登台。演模範操。最高方桌四足中途忽斜傾。有崩潰傾向。形勢嚴重。塲内職員急趨前抱持桌之四足。狀堪發噱。衆云新式疊羅漢。記者謂圓椅無辜被蹂躪。方桌心不平。故爲之復讐也。</p>
<p>▲運動會與淴浴　年來蘇省中學運動會女子部得奬最多者。莫松江女中若。該校健將傅雪珍呂恬志今夏執敎某市校。此次督率健兒與祝頌菊曁錢韵蘭到塲參加。預卜其成績必佳。蓋强將手下無弱兵也。但被二人意興衰颯。向記者曰。中國辦新敎育且三十餘年。運動會亦開三十餘年。各地大大小小運動會。何上千萬。而國人之彎腰曲背如故。面無華色如故。欲求如英美德等國。養成每人每日淴浴一次之習慣猶不可得。運動會云何哉。運動會云何哉。</p>

<p>— 王文濡</p>
<p>何以名之曰新也。今之菊花。有異於昔之菊花者。今人之對於菊花。亦有異於昔人之對於菊花者。即花慨人。讀我詩者。會心當不在遠耳。</p>
<p>附庸風雅恣評批。俗子紛紛古典稽。漫道斯文眞掃地。也能尋摘把花題。（菊之種類。至今爲多。俗子掉文。輙加題品。文不對題。有可哂者。我友潘公展君亦有評句。措詞頗能妍雅。仁優則學。理或然歟）</p>
<p>生來本是寄人籬。紫白黃紅各吐奇。獨占九秋矜色相。笑他晚節亦何時。（昔之所謂冷香幽艷者。今則變却本來面目矣。試以紅樓孤高傲世偕誰隱之句質之。菊亦無辭以對。鳴呼。物猶如此。人何以堪）</p>
<p>厭入當年處士家。炎凉世態一般嗟。熱官豪賈排筵賞。此亦人間富貴花。</p>
<p>盛會喧開列萬盆。市庽號召勝山村。黃華聲價休云賤。一顧獨能博一元。（海上南京路開蒔菊會徵集名種。以供觀覧。門票取洋一元。回憶數年前外人創設此會時。例取三元。今則减去過半矣。）</p>
<p>無言有恨可憐生。怪得天公徇世情。淸品偏敎居濁地。攅眉呌苦到淵明。（東籬佳色。亦復暮楚朝秦。博熱官豪賈之嘆賞。淵明而在。亦當割愛。）</p>
<p>承平東海多新象。慘淡西江現裂㾗。爲問孑遺諸父老。柴桑松菊可猶存。</p>
<p>商量何處着茅菴。舉足荊榛太不堪。衰露采英無我分。避秦難覓菊花潭。</p>
<p>誰將雜種種當門。無數秋容長子孫。間色公然凌正色。驚看黃種爲銷魂。</p>

<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>車向西南行甚緩。屢停。殆無一村落。均在山峯。高出地面在一千七八百尺間。俯視萬山在車底。綠海無邊。半竹半樹。若能開造紙廠。不知相宜否。詩云</p>
<p>南渡火車道。萬山盡竹林。無邊搖綠海。隨意聽鳴禽。</p>
<p>茅屋野人少。荒藤亂木森。遙知幽絶處。瀑布作龍吟。</p>
<p>此等天然林。並無主人。皆由政府收去。故其利無窮也。途中時見男女山頭種人。帶刀而行。因此地不帶刀。無以防蛇獸耳。七時始到南渡。紅白洋式房。電燈照滿。山坡勢均平坦。北緬山無峻厓。故最宜種植。不若香港之高峻苦人也。南渡平曠寛廣。完全爲一銀公司範圍。只富者有自備汽車。餘無一種車可覓。行李用擔。初余在仰光。以爲緬人不會擔。又未見帶笠者來。北緬則帶笠。而擔者甚多。其笠以大竹皮作成。美而堅固也。過一大橋。水流甚急。住于梁金山宅。即有名之梁老大也。滇之永昌人。指揮工人二千餘。包鐵路工程。一次得一二十萬。遂富。而慷慨。工界甚重之。</p>
<p>有張德熙者。熱心告余。距南渡六七站。距拉須四五站。東北行。有五加利王地。居英華中間。其地千里。富銀礦。亦有金。自古吳三桂曾經營之。近英美人均垂涎。據礦工程師云。其銀十倍于南渡。英人曾往採。被加拉人拒回。而華人往採者。加拉人殺牛以迎。其人信回敎者多。現可設法開採。余甚然之。張父製有全緬圖。詳載出產。尤以北緬所出五金寳玉等爲多。</p>

<p>第二日—鬥獸塲—君士坦丁帝凱旋門一加拉加拉共同浴塲一一下敎堂</p>
<p>羅馬的烈日閃閃地流動的時候。我們聯袂出了共同浴塲。上車。鞭着馬向前走。沿着曲徑。靠着士邱。轉入綠樹叢中。便斜上向一個急斜的坡這。似乎山丘。體面地排立着淸麗的小柏。</p>
<p>"Catacombs"車後高聲呌喊着。我們便慌忙走下馬車去。于是踏着紀元一○○年間之跡。所謂"Catacombs"的地下禮拜堂了。</p>
<p>走進聖撒白司的敎堂。看了聖撒白司的的故墓。有聖撒白司的白石臥像。他似乎像回頭過來看我們。這不奉宗敎的幾個中國少年。怎的也會不遠萬里而來瞻仰一番。我們在沈寂陰森的敎堂。走過來。走過去。繞了幾個迴旋。看見了幾張磨石綺刻的聖母生活圖。在祭壇上。在神龕裏。挿滿了寗陣陣百合花。唯一的印象。是一個潔凈神秘的印象：凈。眞是凈土。一些也沒有别的什麽。我實在想不到繁華的歐洲。也會有這清靜絶滅的現象。在這寂寞的殿堂裏。四只有祭壞壇前跪着一位虔誠的巡禮者。口裏呢喃着。我們佇立着。徘徊着。有些遲疑了。恰好從聖撒白司的的墓側的屋子裏。走來一個年輕的修士。我們便走上前去。摹手行禮問道：—</p>
<p>「地下禮拜堂和地下塋窟。就在這裏麽。」</p>
<p>他回答道。</p>
<p>「這裏就是。」</p>
<p>于是再導我們進倉庫般灰黑的門内。分給我們各人以一支像筆幹那樣的白蠟燭。使我們點燃了。再拿着鑰匙。我們穿入地窟。進了所謂Catacombs的地下禮拜堂。</p>
<p>「這是聖撒白司的當日講道之處。這是他的石像。」</p>
<p>領導我們的修士右手執着幽黯的燭光。左手指頭上下點動着說。</p>
<p>那修士給我們說許多聖撒白司的的傳說。一切敎徒受非常抑壓與迫害的故事。還有一些神話。</p>

<p>吾中華民國人民所需求的、並不是華商或華僑、要在坎拿大境内享有什麽特權、只希望華僑與其他各國旅坎人民、華貨與其他各國運坎的商品、享受一律平等的待遇、深盻坎拿大商務考察團諸君東游回國以後、對於此點有所努力、</p>

<h3 id="c203">（一）爲限制華僑入境也 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>坎政府於一九二四年修正移民例、凡中國工人一律不准入境、商人須備有資本値坎金二千五百元以上及專心經營輸出入口商業者、方准入境、此項商人、只能獨身入境不得携帶妻女、學生須具有入大學之程度、畢業後即須離境、不許居留、抑移民局執行斯例時、對於商學各界之入境者、多方盤詰、遇事留難、稍不誣意、即被駁回、是則新往坎境者入口已極難矣、而居留坎境者、移民部亦舉行註册其因註册手續未臻完備、而被駁出境者、爲數頗衆、自此以往我華僑行將絶跡於坎境矣、</p>

<p>查工廠之僱華工、以其動苦耐勞、能以極低額之工資、任長時間之工作、以云待遇較之坎工、本已相去甚遠、乃坎政府頒布最高工時例後、復頒最低工資例、於是華僑先後被工廠排斥以去、即有留存者、工會又迫僱主對之解僱華僑遂陷於失業之苦境矣、</p>
<h3 id="c205">（三）爲禁止華商之僱傭白女也 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>查坎拿大中部之華僑、多營餐店之業、僱傭白女爲侍者、以資招徠、獲利較豐、坎境商人大起妬意、然揆諸產業自由之義、不能阻止華僑之經營是業也、中部諸省政府、乃頒禁止華人餐店僱傭白女之例設、茲限制以害其營業、倘茲例不除、我華僑小商人又將不能立足矣、</p>
<h3 id="c206">（四）日黃白童分校也 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>坎拿大西部之Ｂｒｉｔｉｓｈｃｏｊｕｍｂｉａ省政府以華人爲劣等民族、恐華人子女阻碍白人子女之進展據爲理由、立例禁止華童入白童學校、另設華童　學校、收容華童是舉也、不但使我華僑子女不得與白童受同等之敎育、且語其命意所在、直侮辱我民族矣、</p>
<p>上舉四者僅其犖　大端此外如農業限制洗衣業限制之各種苛例、尤爲更　難數者也、</p>

<p>— 高偉</p>
<p>盧夢殊編</p>
<p>文華美術圖書公司發行</p>
<p>電影是什麽、電影藝術是什麽、電影藝術所要表現的又是什麽、這些問題、在落後的中國、曾有過多少相當的解答沒有、所謂國產電影界所呈現的狀態是什麽、中國電影觀衆所要求的是什麽、在這時代所需要的是怎樣的電影、一切一切、我們所看到的、只覺得無限的悽傷和悲歎、請電影事業的人以賺錢爲能事、可是負有指導之責的電影出版界呢、却又是以「捧」爲能事、眞正對於中國電影、中國電影藝術、有所貢獻的、委實難得、</p>
<p>電影是新興藝術中之第八藝術、是次於文學戲劇、音樂、舞蹈、繪畫、建築、彫刻、而產生於最後的綜合的藝術、我們可以說、電影是近代人類智能極端發達的構成的一種綜合各種藝術而成功的新興藝術、它發達的領域是基於工業的、科學的藝術的、三要件上、缺一就不能的、在現代、在各國、差不多都已占有着很大的潛勢力、在思想的運輪上在觀念形態的决定上所負的一般的任務、是愈積極底了、它暴露一個民族固有的民族精神和民族特徵、也藉此而發揚一個民族固有的民族精神和民族特徵的、那民族色彩的呈露、誠是異常的明顯和强烈、但實際、電影之爲一般的民族所重視、原是事實的條件使然、因着電影的種種特質功能和優點而播養出來的不可思議的握制人性的動止、於是在分量上、在實質上、在不知不覺的欣賞中每易提吊觀衆的心靈和情緖、因爲電影的表現是最接近於人類的生活樣式、而直接地充實人類空虚的心懷、喚醒而激發堅强的意志、從生活的疲勞中忘去一切不幸的缺陷、在銀幕的欣賞裏、感受到新的光明的力、所以、電影普遍性的形成、自有它的獨特的質素、</p>
<p>但是電影傳到中國來的情形怎樣呢、電影傳到中國來還僅有一個短極的歷史、然而却已流入於病態的而且是危險的畸形進展中了、在表面上、中國民衆對於電影確是感到興味了、可是實質呢、仍不脫中國人的老皮氣、只會看到一些皮毛、只會捉住了一些模糊的印象、所謂中國電影的評價、除足以自堕民族性的尊嚴外、再沒有其他可說了、簡直我們不能承認了那些電影是足以代表我們的電影界的、同時更似乎有重新來開始做起的必要、</p>
<p>不過中國電影之所以會沒落至此地步、也未始不是中國文藝的後落的緣故、以致同樣使電影流於無意識的狀態中、未能把握正確的中心思想去開展、是無可諱言的、因之中國電影最大的毛病、可以說是沒有眞正測得電影藝術的指導者、於是爲一輩淺薄無聊的人所侵佔了、現在我們文壇藝壇上總算經過了一個驟然巨變、倡行以確立全體民衆爲中心思想的民族主義文藝運動了、這、必然發生巨大的影響而形式電影的新生機的吧、屬於文藝上的民族主義運動固已爲一般所公認、而電影上民族意識的就主實亦爲一般所需要了、我們正當用電影的特質功能負起當前的民族的使命、同樣、我們爲挽救中國電影的危機、凡是努力電影而不滿意於日前中國影壇的現狀的、都應集到這範疇來、共同致力於民族主義的電影運動、以求中國電影之充分的抵達於燦爛輝煌之域、最近關於這方面的空氣、在我們的影壇上、似也已引起人們的注目了、對於中國電影新生機的開始、誠抱有無限的展望、</p>
<p>關於這運動最先發覺而負担起鼓吹的責任的便是這「電影雜誌」了、「電影」編者盧夢殊君、在影壇的聲譽、凡是稍稍留心中國電影的人、都能知道的吧、盧君深切的認淸了電影藝術的客觀的一般的任務和近代電影藝術的傾向、於是毅然决然樹起了民族主義電影運動的旗幟、一方面、以追隨文藝上的民族主義的確立、一方面、實爲中國影壇突破巨大的危機而創造新的生命、這、盧君的眼光實値得我們敬佩而感謝的、在這種情態之下、以前在、電影」第一二三期上我們即看見有民族主義的電影的理謂的展露了、尤以第三期爲更鮮明、但盧君是尙有更偉大的懷抱的、遂於「電影」第四期刋行「民族主義電影運動專號、」謀進一步積極地推進這運動的力量、這爲我們未來的影</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>壇、是非常的欣喜而不禁祝禱着的、</p>
<p>在「我們的說話」中、我們再認識這專號的態度是怎樣、</p>
<p>…電影雖被淺薄無聊之輩誤認爲娛樂工具之一、而其本身的藝術價値與使命、却並未因之而消失、而其之所以產生、原本與文藝同一的在民族的立場上所形式的意識形態裏而產生的一件藝術品、這原因、同人等便亦繼民族主義文藝運動者之後、而作民族的電影運動、在本刋本期中出一專號以作是項運動之始……</p>
<p>我們固然不敢自滿、我們更不敢自誇、我們旣慨吃影戲飯者之無聊、我們復感於文藝的沒落、</p>
<p>我們爲要求影壇的改善、我們更要求民族的自决、我們於是便極力闡發電影的意識中心、我們更努力地貫輸人們以民族意識、</p>
<p>我們樹起旗幟了、我們呐喊起來了、我們前進了、我們也做出來了、人們、中國的人們、你們當前有了絶大的危機、你們須奮然起來參加我們的工作、</p>
<p>這是何等光明而忠實的態度呵、</p>
<p>在内容方面本期的文字大都屬於理論的建設、本來在一運動的開始、理論確爲首要、根據於正確的理論的基礎、方能一步一步地謀推進、這裏、且提出幾篇主要的略爲談談、</p>
<p>包羅多的「中國需要有民族特徵的影片」、是完全說明電影上的民族特徵的問題、作者認定各國電影都有牠自己的民族特徵表現在上面、因爲「每一個民族自己的特徵、不一樣一樣地去指示出來、世界上人是不會去注意到的、爲了這一層、我們才不得不出來討論我們的民族主義」、至於什麽是中國電影所要表現的民族特徵、作者告訴我們說、「中國的民族特徵在什麽地方、這是藝術家應該去搜索的、成功的藝術作品、沒有不具有每一個民族的特徵的、尤其是近代的藝術作品是如此」、並且還有一樣、「每一個民族的特徵、可以時時地在演進之中、這就是說、我們該負有去創造一下的責任、」</p>
<p>李椿森的「民族主義電影的建設」第一、說明電影的各種特殊的優點和潛勢力之狀態、並將亞美利加·英吉利·德意志·法蘭西·俄羅斯·意大利·日本諸國的常設館所指陳出來、而證明近年來電影支配觀衆力量之偉大、絶不能輕忽視之、第二、闡發電影與民族的關係、和這時代的電影的客觀條件的需要、在建立民族中心意識的文藝的現狀態、是亟需要把民族主義貫進電影去、而且「我們爲進一步鮮明地確立民族意識、冀其充分的發皇、企圖民族主義的電影底建設、實是當今重要的任務、」第三、作者檢討外國電影含藴的質素、以廣義的立塲去論斷、發見它們的共通點、一方面有堅確明瞭的民族意識的標榜、一方面、表現所屬民族的特性、排除一切阻礙自己民族的思想、促進自己民族向上發展的意志、表現自己民族在增長自己的光輝的進程中一切奮鬥悲壯的歷史、作者爲求明顯起見、將各國電影上所表現的民族特性也一一說了、其次、電影的國際性也是値得注意的、大槪的民族在發展的過程中、必然要人認識自己民族的優點、而佔得國際文化上的地位、於是電影便成了媒介物、不過、在現代帝國主義的國家、也往往喜描寫異民族的醜惡來穿挿襯托而自傲自慢、這我們中華民族便是其中倒霉的一個、第四、回過來檢討我們中國的電影界結果發現了滿是沒落的狀態、不單過去的是失望、就是「在目前這種巨大的危機、却還是在方興未艾地進行着、電影界還是蒙在大鼓中深染着根深蒂固的流毒、而不知自覺自救、他們沒有放遠眼光下眞實的考察工夫、他們沒有文藝的評價、以至他們都顯然都近平盲目而站立、離開了民族、離開了人類、的背後去了」、第五、是作者的總結論、肯定在現時代祗有民族主義的電影運動、是中國電影界的惟一的出路、至對於民族主義電影底建設則提出幾個主要的綱領、一、組織强有力的大規模的影片公司、二、訓練演員、三、創作脚本、四、舉辦民族主義的電影雜誌、</p>
<h3 id="c208">畫家龐薰琴之作品 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>秋原的「電影之民族性」、據編者云、秋原原打算要寫四五千字的、可惜因患眼病於是沒法想、勉强寫了這一篇、以後定能再寫一篇、那末、我們待着吧、這篇短文的主旨、是作者認定在電影上其所陳示的民的色彩不僅是民族色彩的片斷、且是民族精神及民族意識底整個、對於電影界的意見、則說、「且慢、讓我們先形成我們對於電影底民族意識、再努力於我們的民族電影底創造吧」、</p>
<p>編者自己的「民族主義與中國電影、在開首就這樣說、「電影這一件新興的藝術品、是民族主義唯一的出路、因爲它不特在史實上、在個性上、可以給人見到一國民族的特徵、並且在個性的方面的展露上、也可以給人見到一個民族精神的表顯、這原因、我們對於中德的電影、便也有了這麽一個急切底需要」、作者又多方面尋繹得到我們中國需要民族主義電影的種種原因、未了作者這一叚眞是說得透切極了、</p>
<p>電影在文藝當中最新生、而且最有力量的、我們現在再不能它使畸形、我們現在要使它眞切地負起它本身的使命、我們現在要使它實現它自己固有的意識中心—民族主義的眞精神、</p>
<p>這民族主義的眞精神、便就是如西洋彩電裏所表現出來的西洋文化、便就是如西洋電影裏所特地提出來給大家作一個眞切的解决的戀愛問題、便如就西洋電影裏所特地闡明的男性美與女性美、總而言之、要跟我們所運動的民族主羲做下去、先生們、吃影戲飯的先生們、請起來、請急切地起來、抛棄以前錯誤的方式、建立現在民族主義的電影、</p>
<p>唐崧高的「中國應有中國底新興電影」、對於電影與民族主義維繫的關係從生活的一方式上闡明、亦有特到的見解、而對於社會也不放鬆、確亦是一篇値得注意的文字、作者最後這樣期望、「這件新興的中華的小民族意識的電影藝術的產生、那就是中國弱小民族的精神上底解放」、</p>
<p>此外有高建華的美國民族精神的表現」、單以美國爲對象而說明之、羅拔高的「流氓皇帝與法國民族性」、以流氓皇帝一片而說明法國民族性的情態、其他的文字留待讀者自己去理會吧、</p>
<p>本期所載之圖畫、實亦張張有力、大都注重於康健美這方面的、使我們號稱病夫的民族看了、有所感觸、</p>
<p>綜觀這本「電影」貢獻於我們影壇的、委實非淺、本期的文字、雖似乎太偏於一方面的探討、可是這種理論的建設、也即是使一般先種下了基本觀念的印象、我謹希望、「電影」就成爲民族主義電影運動的中心刋物、從理論脚本創作影片批詳各方面都着手、來造成中國影壇的靑春的局面、</p>
<p>末了、願中國電影界同人、快快覺醒過來、向民族主義電影運動這條路上去、爲我們的民族、爲我們的電影、</p>

<p>— 彬</p>
<p>復旦新聞學系第一次在葉園舉行</p>
<p>復旦新聞學系、開辦得不到三個學期、但是成績斐然、早有社會人士所讚許、即在本校中各院系互相比擬、也可算是後起的一朶奇花、這最大的原因、還是在乎師生的合作、謝主任指導的得力、我們也可以說、新聞學系所以有今日的成績、决不是偶然的事、况且系中的同輩、人才濟濟、校裏重要的職務如復旦通訊社與五日刋等、都是此中優秀同輩所主辦、師生的合作、亦較它系爲强、因爲謝主任與黃天鵬諸敎授、愛同學實不啻於手足、子女、所以、黃敎授所担任的「報館組織」一科、積極地擬主辦一種小規模的報紙、使同學們取得辦報的經騐與常識、同時、也可趁此機會來練習、預備將來供職國内各大報館裏的應用、像這種熱誠的敎學、在其它學校的敎授中實在不易多見、</p>
<p>我們現在讀書、尤其是研究新聞學的、專心埋頭於書本叢中是不行的、關於這些學問、一定要在外面去找更豐富的、學識、這當然要常與社會接觸、簡言之、在課本之外去爲學問努力是很重要的謝主任早就有見於此、在最短的期間裏、組織了一個每週談話會、時間不定、任新聞學系同學任意參加、祗要不與正課衝突、一方面可以聯絡師生中的感情、一方面可以在隨意的談話中得到了不少的常識、打破課常中上課的呆板和枯燥的生活、這是有意義得多的了、</p>
<p>這第一次舉行每週談話的時候、地址是在葉園、由謝主任新自指導、同學十餘人、連貫步行於目的地、眞的、令有一番風趣、進了、葉園、精神爲之一爽、因爲這裏空氣淸新、每日度那枯燥無味的課堂生活、實有使人精神疲乏之處、謝主任等尋到小亭一座、便相聚而談、其樂融融、非我這枝不生花的秀筆能夠有以形容得淋漓盡緻的呢、</p>
<p>謝主任發表了所以設每週談話一科的宗旨、與及課外導源正確生活的重要、其次、又說到新聞記者要具有靈活的腦筋、敏慧的特性、在採訪新聞的時候、擬訪得對方一個女子的眞實年齡、是很屬不易的事、但是我們做新聞記者的、在這時便要運用靈活的腦筋了、謝主任說、我在日本讀書的時候、某一班同學被派出去實習採訪、是要探訪一個閨秀的眞實年齡、但是這個閨秀是無論如何不肯告訴他們的、其中有一個同學、便機警地運用他底靈活的腦筋了、他先詢問這個閨秀在高等女子學校卒業了已經幾年、卒業的時候是多大年紀、隨後又談到别種婦女問題等等、她都很有興趣的很忠實的回答了、不久、這個同學又問她現在離卒業的時期已經有多少年、她也忘記了一切似的很快的說出來了、這時、這位同學便已到達了他要採訪這閨秀眞實年齡的目的、因爲這閨秀的年齡、祇要將它在高等學校卒業時年齡、加上離開這學校的年數、便等於現在的年齡了、當時在坐同學、聽了謝主任的一席話、呆滯的腦筋不竟爲之啓發、</p>
<p>談至此、又來了一位本系的高才生郭貞一女士、她是由金陵女大轉至此的、所以學問方面是很把握的、但是謝主任笑說探訪女子眞實年齡的秘法、是不傳聞女子的、大家都爲之欣然、但是、我現在將此法已寫下來告與多數閱者、不獨使郭女士補足後至之缺憾了、</p>
<p>葉園的風景、我不加叙述、想閱者都知道的、</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Fourth Plenary Session Opened Yesterday for Review <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Review of the Political Reform Proposals Concluded</p>
<h3 id="e2">Joint Review Meeting of Two Groups <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 16th, the Political and Economic groups of the Fourth Plenary Session held a joint review meeting, conducting detailed studies on proposals such as refreshing central politics, improving the system, rectifying discipline, and determining the central task of governance within the shortest possible time to improve administrative efficiency. The review has now been completed and will be submitted to the fourth plenary session for approval.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Plenary Session May Conclude Tomorrow <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>A certain committee member told reporters that the review by the Political Group concluded on the 16th. The fourth plenary session will discuss it again and it is hoped it will be approved. Furthermore, revisions to the Organic Law of the National Government and the Regulations of the Political Council have also been drafted by the Presidium of the Congress and the Chairmen of the various review groups and can be submitted on the morning of the 17th. As for the selection of candidates for the院 (yuan) and 部 (bu) (referring to governmental branches), it may be decided by the Central Political Council. With the exception of political and party affairs proposals, the proposals to the Congress can generally be discussed at the fourth session on the morning of the 17th. The two categories of education and economic construction, and a portion of military affairs, can be discussed at the fifth session in the afternoon. In the event that time is insufficient and the discussions cannot be completed, there may be another session on the morning of the 18th to discuss unfinished cases and to pass the Congress declaration. The closing ceremony will be changed to the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Education and Military Affairs Not Reviewed <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>On the 16th, the Fourth Plenary Session only held a joint review meeting of the Party Affairs Group and the Political and Economic Groups. The remaining groups, such as Military Affairs and Education, did not hold meetings. Most of the committee members took the opportunity to visit Tangshan and tour various scenic spots. After 10 p.m., Wu Tiecheng, Song Ziwen, Zhang Xueliang, and others went to the National Theater to watch Cheng Yanqiu's performance.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Party Affairs Group Sorted Out Four Proposals <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>The Party Affairs Group of the Fourth Plenary Session held a meeting on the morning of the 16th to continue sorting out the four major Party Affairs proposals, which have been completed and will be submitted to the Congress for report.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Agenda for the Fourth Plenary Session <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The Fourth Plenary Session is scheduled to open at 8 a.m. on the 17th after the memorial week, and it is heard that the agenda for the fourth session is to discuss the political reform proposals and party affairs proposals that were re-submitted for review after the second session. Therefore, the session on the 17th is extremely important.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Proposal for Basic Measures for an Honest Government <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Lu Diping proposed a proposal for establishing basic measures for an honest government, which reads: "I believe that after the initial peace following great chaos and the beginning of political tutelage, the first step in establishing a good model of party governance is to advocate integrity and gain the trust of the people. It is essential to eliminate corruption. Since the late Qing Dynasty, the evil practice of seeking personal gain and engaging in fraud has been prevalent throughout the country. The warlords of the Northern Warlord era ran rampant, and the wind of corruption became even worse. Discipline was undermined, and malpractices arose in abundance. The state of corruption is difficult to describe in writing. Therefore, since the establishment of the National Government of our Party, we have vowed to build an honest government. However, because the poison has penetrated deeply and bad habits are difficult to reverse, there is no lack of those who cherish their integrity, but those who seek personal gain and engage in fraud are also unavoidable. This truly disappoints the people's expectations and stains the revolution. If we do not vigorously reverse the declining trend and eliminate bad habits, there will never be hope for the clarity of national politics, and the suffering of the people will not be relieved. What will we deceive if we speak extravagantly about revolution? Therefore, establishing a truly honest government is the primary task of the current political reform, and the basic measures for establishing an honest government are (1) completing the supervisory system, (2) completing the auditing system, (3) strictly implementing the budget system, (4) clearly ordering party members at all levels to truthfully report corruption, and (5) formulating special laws for punishing corruption and severely punishing corruption. The above-mentioned measures, in the negative aspect, use strict laws to prevent seeking personal gain and engaging in fraud, and in the positive aspect, complete various systems in order to achieve political clarity as soon as possible. Is this appropriate? I respectfully await your decision."</p>
<h3 id="e8">Proposal to Designate the Yangtze River Basin as an Industrial Zone <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Lu Diping proposed a proposal to designate the Yangtze River basin as a model industrial zone. The original text reads: "In the past twenty years in our country, the root causes of all disasters can be summarized in one sentence: only soldiers and bandits. Therefore, today's speakers all regard disarmament and bandit suppression as urgent priorities. However, soldiers are not born to be soldiers, and bandits are not born to be bandits. Upon careful analysis of the composition of soldiers and bandits, there are poor farmers, unemployed workers, bankrupt merchants, out-of-school youth, unemployed teachers, powerless bureaucratic politicians, and all kinds of rogue gangsters. This is all due to the economic oppression of international imperialists in the past century, and the successive bankruptcies of rural economy and handicrafts, resulting in this vast unemployment problem. If we do not seek a fundamental solution to this vast unemployment problem from a positive perspective, but only engage in the negative work of disarmament and bandit suppression, then the disarmed soldiers and the disbanded bandits will still have no legitimate work to do, and still have no way to make a living. How can we prevent them from becoming soldiers or bandits again? Then disarmament will not be enough, bandit suppression will not be enough, and the cycle will repeat itself, only to deplete the vitality of society and the vitality of the nation. Therefore, after disarmament and bandit suppression, we must develop industries, cultivate the national economy, and establish factories to accommodate unemployed vagrants, which is the thorough method of disarmament and bandit suppression. The Yangtze River basin in our country is rich in resources, convenient in transportation, and densely populated. It is a natural industrial area. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce should immediately formulate a detailed plan to designate the Yangtze River basin as a model industrial zone and establish various factories to resist imported goods. It should urge the governments of provinces, cities, and counties along the river to expedite the establishment within the shortest possible time. Those who are unable to raise shares are allowed to issue local bonds or use local public assets. They should consider the local conditions and utilize the natural environment. With the establishment of many factories, many people will be employed. In the social aspect, it can accommodate a large number of unemployed vagrants. In the political aspect, it can eliminate all sources of chaos. In the economic aspect, it can prevent leakage and resist the aggression of imperialists. Is this appropriate? I respectfully await your decision."</p>
<h3 id="e9">Proposal to Register Barren Mountains and Wastelands <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Liu Zhi proposed a proposal to request that the whole country be notified to register barren mountains and wastelands and stipulate the time limit for afforestation (attached draft registration regulations). The original text reads: "The success of agriculture lies in having no uncultivated land, and the full utilization of land resources means that there should be no bare hills. Our country is full of barren mountains and wastelands, and we should find ways to reclaim them, increase production, and plant more forests to develop sources of profit. However, due to the difficult times and the unrest of bandits, there is no accurate survey of the area of barren mountains and wastelands in various provinces, and whether certain wastelands are state-owned, publicly owned, or privately owned. Even if we want to separately set time limits for reclamation, it is like going south by driving the chariot north. Now, it is proposed to formulate regulations for the registration of barren mountains and wastelands, instructing the competent authorities of each province to register the mountains under their jurisdiction within a time limit, draw maps, stipulate afforestation methods and time limits, and announce their implementation. In this way, no one will neglect barren mountains and wastelands, and forestry can be expected to develop. The draft regulations for barren mountains and wastelands are as follows: (Article 1) The purpose of these regulations is to clarify the ownership of barren mountains and wastelands and to urge afforestation. (Article 2) State-owned, publicly owned, and privately owned barren mountains and wastelands, even those that have already been registered in accordance with other laws, must also be registered in accordance with these regulations. (Article 3) Registration in accordance with these regulations is free of charge. (Article 4) For the registration of barren mountains and wastelands, the agricultural and mining or construction departments of each province and region shall determine the area and implement it in stages. The area and time for registration shall be announced by the competent authority and notified by the county government. (Article 5) Within twelve months from the date of the announcement of each area, the owners of barren mountains and wastelands shall apply for registration. If no one applies for registration within the aforementioned time limit, the county government shall investigate and verify that it is state-owned and may temporarily keep it in custody.</p>
<p>If it is publicly owned or privately owned, the county government shall submit a request to the agricultural and mining department or construction department to consider the local situation and set a time limit for supplementary registration, and collect the registration fee. If the time limit is exceeded again, it may be confiscated. (Article 6) When the agricultural and mining department or construction department of each province handles registration, it shall formulate procedures according to state-owned, publicly owned, and privately owned, prepare a register of barren mountains and wastelands, number them in sequence, and issue them to the county governments to assist the construction bureau in handling them. (Article 7) When the owners of publicly owned or privately owned barren mountains and wastelands apply for registration, they shall submit an application form, together with the ownership documents. After the county government sends personnel or the construction bureau to investigate and survey, the registration shall be granted, and the agricultural and mining department or construction department shall issue a registration certificate, and a copy shall be sent to the county government for record. The aforementioned certificate shall be issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining for the competent authority to fill in. (Article 8) If the documents of barren mountains and wastelands are lost or unclear, the four boundaries of the barren mountains and wastelands and the guarantee of the owners or local groups shall be obtained and submitted for registration. When the county government accepts the aforementioned application, it shall issue a public notice. If no one else submits the documents within three months after the time limit stipulated in Article 5, it shall be handled in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 5. (Article 9) The application form for registration shall contain the following information in detail: (1) Name, origin, and address of the owner; (2) Name and location of the barren mountain and wasteland, and whether there are documents; (3) Area and four boundaries of the barren mountain and wasteland; (4) Terrain and all objects on the ground (5) Soil quality grade; (6) Whether taxes are paid; (7) Estimated land price; (8) How is the water and land transportation? (Article 10) Barren mountains and wastelands that have no owners and that should belong to the state according to law shall be investigated by the county government and registered by the competent authority in accordance with paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 of Article 9. (Article 11) For barren mountains and wastelands that pass through more than two counties, in addition to registering separately in accordance with the above procedures, the construction bureaus of each county government shall also draw maps and submit them for verification. (Article 12) When the ownership of a registered barren mountain or wasteland changes, the original registration certificate shall be submitted, together with the documents proving the change, and an application shall be submitted for a new registration certificate. (Article 13) After the competent authority completes the registration, it shall compile the case and report it to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining and the provincial government for record. (Article 14) These regulations shall come into effect from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Proposal to Establish a Forestry Director <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Liu Zhi proposed a proposal to specially establish a Forestry Director for the seven provinces of the Yellow River basin, including Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai, to plant trees along the river, increase production, and prevent floods. The original text reads: "It is found that the Yellow River is most prone to breaches during the summer and autumn seasons, and the loss of life and property of the people and the expenditure on post-disaster projects amount to tens of millions, not to mention the annual river defense expenses. The ancients said that there is no best policy for governing the river. For thousands of years, almost no one has dared to refute this statement. I do not know that the Yellow River flows eastward from Guanzhe because the soil in the Henan region is too loose to control the water. Therefore, the embankment is eroded by the river water, resulting in the disaster of breaches. If trees are planted all over the embankment and on both sides of the embankment, the soil will be entangled and gradually strengthened by the roots of the trees. The embankment will be sufficient to control the water, and the river disaster will be reduced. This is from the perspective of preventing harm. It is appropriate to urgently build this forest along the river. Now, let's discuss it from the perspective of developing benefits. The Yellow River starts from Qinghai in the west and ends at Shandong into the sea in the east, running through the seven provinces of Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Zhili, and Shandong. The total length is about 8,800 miles. The land on both sides is several miles wide, and the area that can be afforested, excluding Qinghai, Henan, and Shandong, is about 143,000,000 acres. If trees can be planted all over, the profits after ten years cannot be calculated. How can we overestimate the direct increase in the wealth of the country and society? As for the indirect benefits of harmonizing the climate, beautifying the scenery, and preventing wind and sand, it is even more difficult to enumerate. Now, the methods are attached below for reference. Afforestation methods along the Yellow River: (1) The central government shall specially establish a Forestry Director for the seven provinces and regions of the Yellow River basin, including Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Zhili, and Shandong, to be responsible for planning the forestation project along the Yellow River. (2) The entire length of the river is divided into approximately seven sections, from Qinghai in the west to the estuary in Shandong in the east. Each section shall be headed by a forestry co-director, concurrently held by the director of the agricultural and mining department or construction department of each province, to facilitate control.</p>
<p>When necessary, the central government may select and appoint or remove them. (3) The agricultural and mining department or construction department of the seven provinces in the Yellow River basin must send five to ten special commissioners to be under the command of the Forestry Director to assist in afforestation matters. (4) The location of the Forestry Director's office shall be designated by the central government or selected by the Director himself, depending on the convenience of the affairs. (5) The county magistrates of the counties through which the Yellow River passes must be directly under the command of the Forestry Director. (6) The funds shall be specially allocated by the central government or recognized by the local governments of each province. (7) The area for planting trees shall be bounded by the alluvial land and sand beaches inside and outside the main dike. If it is deemed necessary for security, private land may also be occupied. (8) The species of trees should be mainly poplar, willow, elm, and tung. Other species, such as pine and cypress, must be adapted to the soil properties and adjusted accordingly. However, this does not apply when there is a specific plan. (9) Each county through which the river passes must plant at least 100,000 trees each year and complete the planting within five years, with the goal of covering all available land. (10) For counties along the river where forests have been established, in addition to the construction bureau being responsible for management, the county magistrate must immediately set up dozens of forest police officers to be responsible for protection and irrigation. (11) After three years of tree species, the funds obtained from repairing and cutting trees, in addition to deducting the self-recognized and administrative expenses of each province, must be specially stored as forest management funds. (12) After the planted trees can be received, the central and local assistance will be stopped. (13) The county magistrates shall strictly abide by the Forestry Law in regard to the protection and punishment of this forest. (14) For the counties through which the Yellow River passes, a separate achievement evaluation method shall be formulated based on the quality of the tree planting, and the Forestry Director shall send personnel to investigate and report to the central government and consult with local officials for separate rewards and punishments. (15) These methods shall be implemented from the date of approval and promulgation.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Proposal for a Yellow River Diversion Plan <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Liu Zhi requested the establishment of a special fund for the Yellow River Diversion Plan to facilitate implementation and develop water conservancy. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>"It is found that the Yellow River has a vast and continuous water force, spanning several provinces. Any negligence will result in the ruin of millions of lives and properties. The relationship between the national economy and the people's livelihood is extremely important. The river management should focus on prevention. Although huge sums are spent annually on temporary repairs, the danger of breaching and冲决(a violent break in the river banks) is still inevitable. It is a plan to treat the symptoms but not the root cause. It is not a long-term solution. With the current scientific inventions, there should be new constructions, hoping to cure both the symptoms and the root cause to eliminate disasters and develop benefits. In the past, the Mississippi in North America and the Nile in Egypt had rivers whose sources were larger than the Yellow River. In the past, the damage was also equal. Recently, after the active renovation of these countries, it has been transformed into a source of profit, and there is no better way to do it once and for all. It is proposed to follow the methods of river management in these countries, first select a site in Henan province on both banks of the Yellow River to set up gates and siphons to divert water into the Huiji, Jialu, and Wei rivers. It can not only draw water for irrigation but also eliminate the water force. The water force is divided and the river disaster is reduced. Moreover, the Huiji and Jialu rivers are all more than 300 miles long, and sluice gates can be set up along the banks to open branch canals to draw water for irrigation. Also, ships can directly pass through the south to the Yangtze and Huai rivers and the north to Tianjin and G沽(a river in Tianjin). It is of great benefit to the local economy, which cannot be compared to the benefit of only doing repairs and still being unable to prevent it. The benefits and harms are not counted. This project has been instructed to be planned by the competent officials. It is estimated to cost 2,870,400 yuan. However, it is noted that Article 17 of the founding program of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen states that all matters that are of a national nature should be assigned to the central government, and those that are appropriate for local conditions should be assigned to the local governments. This matter involves several provinces and should be planned as a whole in order to promote the full benefit. Now is the period of political tutelage, and there are hundreds of things to be done in river construction, and the first thing to do is to manage the river, which is one of the industrial plans of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. It is appropriate to catch up quickly to realize it and request the allocation of special funds to facilitate implementation.</p>
<p>▲Outline of the Yellow River Management Plan (1) Plan to divert the Yellow River into the Huiji and Jialu rivers (2) Siphon water plan (3) Plan to divert the Yellow River into the Wei River (1) Plan to divert the Yellow River into the Huiji and Jialu rivers It is found that the south bank of the Yellow River from Liuyuan Ferry to the Kaifeng Shuimendong Huiji River out of the city is about 24 miles. Setting up a gate to divert a canal from here can not only improve the drinking water in the provincial capital, but also open up canals for irrigating fields and facilitating boats due to the abundant source of water below the Shuimendong. All the agricultural, industrial, and commercial businesses in Kaifeng, 则氏, Fugou, Xihua, Shang, Xiaohuaiyang, Chenliu, Qixian, Suixian, Tuocheng, and Luyi counties can be developed day by day. The benefits are unmatched. The construction costs and benefits are estimated as follows: (A) Construction costs (1) Survey fee The survey of the Huiji and Jialu river basins for more than 600 miles and the irrigation area requires about 6,000 yuan. (2) Land fee The excavation of 80 miles of new canals occupies about 34 hectares. The average price per mu is calculated at 25 yuan, totaling 85,000 yuan. (3) Gate repair fee The construction of 5 steel gates requires 32,335 yuan. The construction of 30 wooden sluice gates for the two rivers requires 10,000 yuan each, totaling 462,000 yuan. (4) Bank protection and stone masonry project fee It is proposed to protect the banks with stone masonry within 4 miles above and below the gate, which requires about 181,000 yuan. (5) Reservoir construction Five reservoirs of various sizes need a total of 318,000 yuan. (6) Earthwork fee Calculated in two items: 子 and 丑 (子) Excavation of the main canal, from the gate to Xiema Camp into the Jialu River, is 80 miles long and requires the excavation of 442,000 cubic feet of soil. Each cubic foot is calculated at 5 jiao, totaling 221,000 yuan. (丑) Dredging of the old course of the Huiji River, from Kaifeng Shuimendong to Chenliu County for 40 miles, requires the excavation of 180,000 cubic feet of soil. Each cubic foot is calculated at 5 jiao, totaling 90,000 yuan. The remaining 260 miles of the river course below Chenliu still have old辙(path). The dredging fee is calculated at 500 yuan per mile, totaling about 130,000 yuan, totaling 220,000 yuan. (7) Bridge fee Construct 11 bridges along the Jialu River and 20 bridges along the Huiji River, totaling 21 bridges. Each bridge requires 5,000 yuan, totaling 155,000 yuan. (8) Project management fee During the construction period, there must be project management fees. Excluding the land purchase fee, it is calculated at 2.5% of the total project, which requires about 38,000 yuan. (9) Contingency fee In addition to the above items, there must be a contingency fee of 38,000 yuan for temporary accidental engineering. The total construction cost is 1,694,000 yuan. (B) Benefit estimation After the Huiji and Jialu rivers are dredged, they can reach Chenliu, Qixian, Suixian, Luyi, and Tuocheng counties in the southeast, and Weishi, Fugou, Xihua, Shangshui, and Huaiyang counties in the due south. It is difficult to count the irrigated fields in the past. Its waterway converges with sand into the Huai River, connects to the Yangtze River, and connects the Huaihe and Yellow River transportation routes, assisting the three transportation routes of Jinpu, Pinghan, and Longhai. The northwest and southeast arms refer to each other to make the situation embarrassing. The spiritual convenience of such transportation will not be less in future shipping tax revenue. As for the development of commerce and the advancement of culture, its intangible benefits cannot be described in detail.</p>
<p>(2) Siphon water plan It is found that the water surface of the Yellow and Qin rivers is higher than the ground outside the embankment in many places. It is very suitable to use a siphon to draw water for irrigation. In the winter of the 17th year, a 6-inch iron pipe was installed on the west embankment of the Zhengbei Huayuankou in Shanghai. The water was very strong. A 14-mile canal was excavated from the water outlet and passed through the north and south Sisuo rivers to reach the Jialu main river. It is now planned to install eight 24-inch iron pipes there. According to the average water level in spring, summer, and autumn, each payment can yield 30 cubic feet of water per second. Eight payments can yield 240 cubic feet of water per second. Not only can it irrigate more than 500 hectares of dry land along the Jialu upstream Zhengzhong counties into fertile land, but it can also make the Huai River waterway reach Zheng County directly and connect with the railway to facilitate transportation. (A) Construction costs (1) Eight siphon pipes 32,000 yuan (2) Water absorption tank 6,400 yuan (3) Water diversion pool 6,000 yuan (4) Survey fee 2,000 yuan (5) Land purchase fee 4,600 yuan (6) Earthwork fee 40,000 yuan (7) Management fee 1,000 yuan (8) Accidental engineering and miscellaneous expenses 4,400 yuan The total cost of the above items is 96,400 yuan. Each mu should pay 1 yuan and 0982 cents and 8 hao. (B) Benefit estimation According to the calculation of the annual increase in production value of 3 yuan per mu, 500 hectares will receive a total of 150,000 yuan per year. The benefits from shipping and transportation cannot be counted.</p>
<p>(3) Plan to divert the Yellow River into the Wei River It is found that the old course of the Yellow River runs from the Qinkou River near the northeast to Xinxiang for about 85 miles. If a new river is excavated on the old course and a main canal is opened eastward near the second embankment, then Wuzhi, Xiuwu, Huojia, Xinxiang, Jijun, Neihuang, Yuanwu, Yangwu, and Yanjin ten counties can be irrigated for more than 10,000 hectares. The Yellow River enters the Wei River, and the Tianjin-Wei River route is smooth, which is of great benefit. The construction costs and benefits are briefly estimated as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Construction costs (1) Survey fee The various surveys of the Wei River basin and the irrigation area require about 2,000 yuan. (2) Land purchase fee The excavation of the main canal occupies about 42 hectares. The average price per mu is calculated at 50 yuan, totaling 210,000 yuan. (3) Earthwork fee The excavation of the main canal requires the excavation of 918,000 cubic feet of soil. Each cubic foot is calculated at 5 jiao, totaling 459,000 yuan. (4) Gate construction fee The diversion gate, water intake gate, and bank protection project are estimated to cost 120,000 yuan for labor and materials. Five falling water gates for the main canal cost about 10,000 yuan each, totaling 50,000 yuan. The branch canal diversion gates cost about 50,000 yuan for labor and materials, totaling 220,000 yuan. (5) Bridge fee The construction of 20 bridges is calculated at 5,000 yuan per bridge, totaling 100,000 yuan. (6) Project management fee The project management fee during the construction period is about 20,000 yuan. (7) Contingency engineering fee Temporary engineering,</p>

<p>Friendliness towards China was also one of the policy guidelines announced by Hamaguchi upon taking office. Since the Tanaka cabinet implemented an active policy, Sino-Japanese relations had become increasingly dangerous. When Japan sent troops to Shandong, it aroused even greater resentment among the Chinese people, resulting in a major blow to its commercial and economic interests in China. Hamaguchi succeeded, realizing the mistakes of the Tanaka cabinet's policy toward China, and advocated friendliness towards China. He promoted Shidehara, who shared the same views, as Foreign Minister to establish the direction of its diplomacy toward China. Although its traditional policies did not change in practice, its methods were more moderate than before, regaining a lot of the feelings of the Chinese people. This was also one of the reasons why Hamaguchi gained the sympathy of his domestic people. However, this kind of friendship is only based on speculation of interests, and not on the principle of international equality. Therefore, whenever diplomacy is encountered, there is always a risk of incompatibility. If you want to practice friendship, you must fundamentally reform. Yongai, the deputy foreign minister, returned to China after traveling to China and expressed his feelings today, saying that in the future, we should abandon the policy of intimidation and catering to China and replace it with understanding and affection to seek the welfare of the two countries. Mr. Yongai has traveled all over the north and south of our country and is familiar with the national conditions of our country. Therefore, what he said is more realistic. Intimidation is Tanaka's policy, and catering is the policy of the current cabinet. Neither is the right track of diplomacy. The current cabinet has ordered Foreign Minister Shidehara to serve concurrently as Prime Minister because Hamaguchi was assassinated. However, the diplomatic policy remains unchanged. However, it is often empty words of friendship, and it does not show one or two real evidences of true friendship in fact, so that our people can recognize Japan's sincerity towards China. Then the gap between China and Japan will not be eliminated after all. This depends on the efforts of the Japanese government in the future.</p>
<p>Although Shidehara is serving concurrently as Prime Minister, the people of the Cabinet Civil Administration Party believe that he belongs to the neutral faction and may not be able to cope with the enemy party's responsibilities, so they still express dissatisfaction. Moreover, the two factions of Adachi and Ekagi are competing with each other. On the day the parliament meets, there will inevitably be a major dispute with the enemy party. No one can predict what kind of changes will occur in the political situation. Then, how can we talk about diplomacy today?</p>
<h3 id="e13">Receiving Important Domestic Telegrams <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>If there are items not included in the budget, it is calculated based on the management fee, which requires about 20,000 yuan. (8) Operating fee After the project is completed and before irrigation benefits are obtained, the operating fee is about 50,000 yuan. The total cost of the above items is more than 1,080,000 yuan. It is calculated that 1 yuan and 06 cents per mu is spread over 10,000 hectares. (B) Benefit estimation (1) Irrigation benefit Calculated based on a flow rate of 1,000 cubic feet per second, irrigation is carried out once every 40 days on average, which can irrigate 10,000 hectares. The total increase in production value is calculated at 3 yuan per mu per year, totaling 3 million yuan per year. (2) Shipping benefit It is found that 20 years ago, the daily traffic of goods on the Wei River was about 1,000 tons. In the future, diverting the Yellow River into the Wei River will supplement the Wei River's water volume, and steamships can travel unimpeded. The traffic of goods should be able to exceed several times the previous level. Even if the average daily traffic is calculated at 2,000 tons, each ton will be charged 6 jiao for the organization fee, which can increase the revenue by 422,000 yuan per year. The total irrigation and shipping benefits are about 4,282,000 yuan per year. The project cost of the above three plans is 2,870,400 yuan, and the total benefits from increased production and shipping traffic are about 4,282,000 yuan per year.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Proposal to Establish a Food Bureau <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Fang Juehui proposed the establishment of a Central Food Bureau to maintain the people's food supply and enrich the national treasury. The full text is as follows: "Our country is founded on agriculture, and farmers constitute the largest proportion of the national population. The rural economy holds the key to the national economy. If the rural economy is not perfect, social order will be disrupted, and all construction will be difficult to start. In the current situation of China, to seek the prosperity of the national economy and the stability of social order, we must first pay attention to solving the economic problems of farmers. However, our country's science is not advanced, and production technology has not been improved. The farmers' annual harvest is already insufficient after repaying land rent and purchasing daily necessities. Once there is a famine year, there is no stored grain in the family, and they have no choice but to rely on high-interest loans to maintain their lives, and wait until the new grains and wheat of the coming year are harvested before repaying. Some unscrupulous merchants take advantage of the opportunity to purchase and hoard at low prices when new grains and wheat are harvested and farmers are eager to sell to repay their debts. When the lean season comes in the spring, they sell at high prices to gain huge profits, causing the price of the same grain and wheat to fluctuate greatly within a year, and causing the bankruptcy of small and medium-sized farmers' economy. To seek remedial measures, in a passive aspect, we should use political power to prohibit the manipulation and hoarding of unscrupulous merchants. In an active aspect, the central government should establish a Food Bureau to regulate the supply. In times of good harvest, the bureau will purchase and store grains, which can stabilize grain prices and prepare for famine. If the central government handles this, it can not only avoid the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, but also avoid the disadvantages of each locality being isolated from each other. For example, if there is a good harvest in area A and a famine in area B, the Central Food Bureau can purchase and transport the surplus grain from area A to area B, which can not only avoid the obstruction of local governments, but also achieve the effect of rapid transportation. In a single transfer, the central government can regulate the supply and demand of areas A and B, and obtain considerable benefits. This is the first reason why the central government should establish a Food Bureau from a domestic perspective. Secondly, from an international perspective, our country's agricultural production is not insufficient to be self-sufficient, but due to obstructed transportation and difficult regulation, the price of food purchased from foreign countries every year reaches tens of millions of yuan. Moreover, international capitalist imperialists are constantly seeking to occupy the market of our country's agricultural products, making our rural economy even more desperate. If there is a Central Food Bureau, it can follow the Premier's food distribution and export methods, and according to the size of the population in various parts of the country, use the surplus of area A to supply the needs of area B. If there is still surplus, it can be stored for more than a year, and only the remaining can be exported to foreign countries, so as not to be manipulated and monopolized by international traders. If there is a famine in the country, the central government can directly import food from foreign countries, and avoid unscrupulous merchants from profiting from it. Thus, the central government can not only control international grain trade, but also benefit from regulating the people's food supply. This is another reason why the central government should establish a Food Bureau. In short, the establishment of a Central Food Bureau has only benefits and no disadvantages. Our country had the establishment of Ever-Normal Granaries in ancient times, but due to poor management, many abuses arose. Now, if we establish a Central Food Bureau with strict and precise management methods, unify powers and responsibilities, and eliminate long-standing abuses, it can not only regulate the domestic food supply, improve the rural economy, make it easier to start the tutelage work, but also prevent international oppression and monopoly, and prevent profits from flowing out. Based on the above reasons, I have drafted the following measures. I respectfully ask for your decision on whether they are appropriate. (Measures) A. The Establishment and Tasks of the Central Food Bureau: (1) Establish a Central Food Bureau directly under the National Government. (2) Abolish various affiliated agencies related to the people's food supply, such as the People's Food Committee, to achieve unified command. (3) The Central Food Bureau shall be fully responsible for regulating the national food supply and for managing the import and export of food. (4) The Central Food Bureau shall be fully responsible for designing methods to improve food production. B.

<p>The delegation of petitioners from the Northern Fujian Fellow Townsmen Association in Beijing submitted a memorial to the Fourth Plenary Session, stating that Northern Fujian is located upstream and is close to Jiangxi Province. The communist bandits of Hunan and Jiangxi are now being pressed by the large army and will inevitably try to flee into Fujian. There are no heavy troops stationed there, and the remnants of the Lu bandits are scattered in various counties of Jianning and Shaowu. If the communist bandits and Lu bandits join forces, the suppression will never be completed. It is requested that a large army be dispatched quickly to enter Fujian from the sea or the Zhejiang border and be stationed in the Jianning and Shaowu area. Advancing, they can connect with the Jiangxi army to implement an encirclement; defending, they can also consolidate the defense of Fujian and avoid turmoil.</p>

<p>Chiang Kai-shek Gave Instructions to the Officers and Soldiers of Zhang Xueliang's Guards</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang visited Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum at noon on the 16th. When he arrived at the Mausoleum Park, he first took photos with Zhu Guangmu, Hu Ruoyu, and He Fenglin, and toured the surrounding mountain scenery. Chiang Kai-shek also arrived at 12:30 PM. He first took a short rest with Zhang in the ear room on the right side of the spirit hall, and then began the ceremony. At that time, the entire guard team, led by Commander Xu, advanced from the mausoleum road to outside the gate of the spirit hall. Zhang stood in the center, and the entourage was divided into two columns, one for civil and one for military. Chiang Kai-shek also stood on the left side to accompany the ceremony. Zhang personally presented a wreath. After the ceremony, Zhang asked Chiang Kai-shek to leave the auditorium and give instructions to the officers and soldiers of the guard team, expounding on the main points of the Three Principles of the People: (1) Anyone who does not uphold nationalism and does not have nationalistic ideas is not worthy of being a complete citizen. We soldiers must especially understand nationalism and be role models for being human. We must liberate ourselves from the oppression of imperialism and build an equal and free country. (2) Soldiers are protectors of civil rights, not oppressors of the people. If civil rights cannot develop, the country cannot be independent. When in the army, you can be good soldiers; when discharged, you can be good citizens, and be responsible for building the country together with the people and organizing society. If civil rights develop, it will not be difficult to build a sound country. (3) Soldiers build the country in order to seek a good life for the people. You also have parents, wives, children, friends, and relatives at home. Therefore, your hard work must be subject to extremely strict constraints, which is also for the good life of your own families. In short, the Three Principles of the People are for building the country, building people, and building soldiers. I hope that all officers will earnestly advise the soldiers and strive to practice the Three Principles of the People, so that they can be liberated from the oppression of imperialism. This responsibility rests entirely on our soldiers. I hope you will work hard. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<p>Zhuang Zhihuan's Wireless Report</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhuang Zhihuan reported at the Central Broadcasting Station on the 16th on the negotiations regarding the revocation of the agreement on the unification of submarine cables of the Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific companies. The outline is as follows: (1) Prohibit submarine cable landings; (2) Cancel submarine cable patents; (3) Prohibit free sending and receiving of telegrams; (4) China has the freedom to stipulate submarine cable fees and transit fees; (5) Pay off the principal and interest of debts to facilitate negotiations. Regarding the Sino-Japanese telecommunications negotiations: (1) Open a submarine cable between Shanghai and Nagasaki; (2) Open a submarine cable between Qingdao and Sasebo; (3) Open a submarine cable between Chuanshi Mountain and Danshui; (4) Open a submarine cable between Yantai and Dalian; (5) Negotiate on telecommunications between Southern Manchuria and Japan. The above ten items will be discussed one by one. Currently, at the beginning of the negotiations, both parties are exchanging opinions on the Shanghai-Nagasaki submarine cable. The Japanese side also insists on its acquired interests and refuses to return them. Our side is arguing on the basis of reason and refuses to give up, so no concrete methods have been discussed yet. In short, the handling of international telecommunications negotiations this time is based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, so that in the future, China's international telecommunications traffic can be free from all restrictions of unequal treaties, and can stand on a balanced footing with all countries in the world for development.

<h3 id="e65">Japanese Prime Minister Hamaguchi's Condition Still Not Out of Danger <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Acting Prime Minister Shidehara Narrowly Escapes, Jiangmu and Andatsu Factions Secretly Feud</p>
<p>▲ United Press of Japan, Tokyo, 16th The condition of Prime Minister Hamaguchi deteriorated temporarily last night. Yesterday evening, the nurse on duty suddenly came out of the sickroom and reported the Prime Minister's condition to the attending physician, Mr. Manabe, in a low voice. Mr. Manabe looked very shocked and immediately entered the sickroom to examine the Prime Minister in detail with Dr. Shioda. Then, except for the two doctors and Mrs. Hamaguchi, her two children, all were asked to leave the sickroom. The ministers who came to express their sympathy to the Prime Minister also waited for the announcement in the next room. At 9:00 PM, the two secretaries, Mr. Nakajima and Mr. Toda, carefully consulted and then announced the Prime Minister's condition at 10:00 PM. It can be seen that there was a major change in the condition at that time. The atmosphere inside and outside the sickroom was quite tense for a while. Dr. Shioda told reporters at 11:00 PM last night: "When I examined the Prime Minister at 6:00 PM this evening, there were slight signs of problems in his chest. The more this kind of phenomenon occurs, the more dangerous it becomes. If the body temperature is the highest and the breathing and pulse are not disordered, then it can be regarded as optimistic. At present, the gas in his abdomen has not yet been released. He was injected with a sleeping drug once at 9:30 PM.</p>
<p>▲ United Press of Japan, Tokyo, 16th Dr. Shioda announced Prime Minister Hamaguchi's condition as follows: "The stomach was washed at 8:00 AM on the 16th, and gastric juice containing bile was washed out, which seemed to be quite comfortable. If this condition continues for two or three days and no gas is produced, there should be no concern." At 9:00 AM, the pulse was 95, the body temperature was 37.6 degrees, and the breathing was 15. At noon, the body temperature was 37.5 degrees, the pulse was 97, and the breathing was 18.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 16th The appointment of Foreign Minister Shidehara as Acting Prime Minister is of course the result of Minister of the Army Ugaki's illness, but behind the scenes there are still complex relationships within the Cabinet and with the party. This is because the heroes do not give way to each other, so the neutral Shidehara was elected. It can also be said that Shidehara gained this position by chance. Within the Minseito Party, the secret struggle between the Andatsu faction and the Jiangmu faction is quite fierce. Andatsu has a great influence in the general election. Jiangmu, the Minister of Railways, is the mastermind of Prime Minister Hamaguchi and also has an invincible force. No matter who of the two serves as the Acting Prime Minister, it will shake the party. On the night when Prime Minister Hamaguchi was assassinated, the two factions were quite active in secret. Seeing this situation, Minister of Railways Jiangmu immediately used lightning-fast means to tell Prime Minister Hamaguchi and invited Minister of the Army Ugaki to understand, and first obtained Shidehara's approval, and then personally proposed to the Cabinet to elect Shidehara, and without waiting for Shidehara's approval or disapproval, he pushed him to be the Acting Prime Minister. The inside story is like this, so Shidehara's acting is only temporary. If Prime Minister Hamaguchi needs some time to recover from his illness, he will be subject to political considerations again, especially since the opening of the Diet is imminent, which makes Shidehara even more uneasy. As for what strange strategies the Jiangmu faction will come up with, it is impossible to guess. The Andatsu faction's nerves are tense for it.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 16th Although Prime Minister Hamaguchi's condition is progressing very smoothly, it will still take a considerable amount of time for him to fully recover. However, there is only one and a half months left before the Diet convenes. If Prime Minister Hamaguchi cannot attend the Diet in person, the opposition parties' attacks will be concentrated on Shidehara's concurrent position as Prime Minister, and communication with the ruling party and other matters will be hindered. Therefore, there is a lot of dissatisfaction within the Minseito Party with Shidehara's acting Prime Minister. Some people advocate introducing a Cabinet member from the party to replace the vacant post of Prime Minister in order to reorganize the lineup. If this proposal becomes a concrete development, it will cause disputes in the party's power relations. It is worth paying attention to the extent to which this atmosphere will develop.</p>

<p>All Industries in the Capital Declare a General Strike to Protest the Security Team's Shooting and Injuring Workers</p>
<p>Traffic Stops... Shops Close</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Madrid, 14th Today, the funerals of the four people who were crushed to death when a seven-story building collapsed were held, and 50,000 people carried the coffin. The authorities prohibited them from passing through a certain street in the busiest part of the city, resulting in a conflict with the police. The police, unable to resist the crowd, opened fire in self-defense, killing four people and injuring many more, including 11 police officers. As for the cause of the collapse, it is said to have been caused by the negligence of the engineer and the contractor. The construction industry has declared a general strike until Sunday.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Madrid, 15th Since yesterday's conflict between construction workers and the security team in the Spanish capital, a bloody incident has occurred, resulting in the death of five workers and the injury of more than 40 workers and police officers. Today, a general strike has been declared. The labor union insists that the captain of the security team, who did not give a warning before suddenly ordering to fire, be dismissed and that more than 100 arrested workers be released. The authorities seem determined to use force to suppress the strike, so the situation is extremely serious. Residents are extremely frightened and are hoarding food in preparation for emergencies. Many shops are also closed. Striking workers are marching in teams in poor areas, shouting slogans such as "Down with the King" and "Overthrow the Government." There are also reports of strikes and riots in Barcelona, Valencia, Cordoba, and other smaller cities outside the capital. Furthermore, the railway workers across the country are demanding a pay increase and are threatening to strike. Another telegram states that the strike leaders in the Spanish capital have just announced that the workers in public utilities and bakeries will go on a general strike for 24 hours, and the workers in other industries will go on strike for 48 hours. In the afternoon, students joined the workers' march, causing many conflicts to occur in various places. In the evening, the entire city was plunged into darkness, all traffic was suspended, and the army was preparing in the barracks. The labor union committee has notified the workers to strictly maintain order. Newspapers have suspended publication, so rumors are spreading like wildfire, and people's hearts are even more volatile.</p>

<p>Will Have Important Developments</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 15th A message from Constantinople says that the ambassador to Turkey left for Rome yesterday to participate in the talks between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and the diplomatic authorities of Italy and Turkey. This shows that the important development of the Balkans is further advanced. It is said that this development was promoted by Greek Prime Minister Venizelos. After touring various European capitals in 1928, Mr. Venizelos went to Ankara, the capital of Turkey, to sign the Treaty of Friendship and the naval limitation agreement between Greece and Turkey. At that time, commentators believed that an important step in the negotiation process had been reached. Not long after, Hungarian Prime Minister Bethlen visited Ankara, and rumors abounded, saying that Turkey, Greece, and Hungary would launch a Balkan alliance under the guidance of Italy to resist French imperialism in Eastern Europe. However, Mr. Venizelos denied this, saying that his goal was to form a free and friendly alliance of the Balkan and Near Eastern countries. The greatest obstacle at present is the tense relationship between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.</p>
<h3 id="e70">British Economic Policy Unchanged <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>MacDonald's Speech at the Labor Party Congress</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 16th British Prime Minister MacDonald said at a Labor Party rally in Bedford last night that no British government can absolutely assure overseas autonomous territories that the British people can tolerate economic policies that will reduce foreign trade or impose taxes on food and raw materials used by factories. He does not adhere to free trade or other doctrines, but in today's fierce competition, some situations will inevitably depress the standard of living. This is a fact. This situation does not come from free trade countries, but from protectionist countries with gradually lower wages. No matter how advocates of import tariffs argue, no one with knowledge can say that tariffs can maintain a high standard of living and enable the people of protectionist countries to maintain a standard of living that meets humanitarian standards. He believes that a government that encounters such difficulties should have a sense of security. He does not believe that a general election is necessary at present, nor does he believe that the people of the country currently want a general election.</p>

<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Shimonoseki, 16th Nagai, the Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, who inspected southern China and Manchuria and Korea, arrived in Shimonoseki on the Gyeongbok Maru, a connecting ferry between Shimonoseki and Busan, at 6:30 PM yesterday and stayed at the Sanyo Inn. When reporters visited him, they told him about the assassination of Prime Minister Hamaguchi. Nagai said, "Prime Minister Hamaguchi had already been aware of this kind of thing, but I am really surprised that he was actually assassinated. It is truly beyond human comprehension that a prime minister with such sincerity would be assassinated. This time I traveled to China and spent a little time. China is full of new atmosphere, which can be seen everywhere. We should abandon the intimidating and catering policies of the past towards this awakened old country and seek to increase the welfare of both countries with understanding and empathy. The issue of my slip of the tongue seems to have caused quite a bit of criticism, but it was definitely not a slip of the tongue. I also had a frank conversation with Chiang Kai-shek. The overseas Chinese are gradually becoming active due to the pacification of the internal unrest. The only regret is that it is very inconvenient to educate children in primary and secondary schools. This is also something that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should consider."</p>

<h3 id="e74">The Depression of the Sino-Russian Conference <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>▲ Mo Dehui is in a Dilemma in Russia ▲ The Future of the Conference Awaits Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang's Decision</p>
<p>▲ Four Newly Appointed Special Commissioners Postpone Their Trip to Russia</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Since Wu Zesheng returned home with his mission to report on the Sino-Russian Conference, there has been no news here. The Directorate General of the Chinese Eastern Railway occasionally receives a telegram from Moscow, but the sentences are incomplete and mostly unimportant, so the Directorate General suspects that the Russian side is checking the telegrams and intercepting them. Previously, Mo was already prepared to return home, but he was instructed by a telegram from the Central Government to postpone his departure from Russia so that the Russian side would be responsible for the breakdown of the conference, and he was allowed to allocate 30,000 yuan for the delegation's expenses. As a result, Mo suspended his return to China. A few days ago, he telegraphed the diplomatic messenger Fu Zhanwen to send him leather clothes quickly and to purchase enough food for three months. However, the special commissioners Tu Weiseng and Li Chen left Russia a month ago and are still living in Paris. If there is no definite date for the resumption of the conference, these people will not return to Russia. Karakhan and Mo Dehui met informally once last week. They did not discuss the conference in depth because Russia would not allow concessions on the Boli Conference records, and we did not express any recognition. The meeting was just a friendly meeting. A certain important person in the Railway Council here received a letter from a secretary in the delegation the day before yesterday, which contained words related to the Sino-Russian Conference, roughly saying, "At present, the responsibility of Plenipotentiary Mo is quite difficult. If he returns home hastily, it will be a minor matter to delay diplomatic relations, and a major matter to reopen the border conflict. It is useless to stay here without returning home. Whether the conference can open up a new situation depends on the attitude of our Central Government and whether or not it recognizes the Boli Agreement. Since the Central Government has no detailed instructions to Mo, Mo is in a dilemma. Mo himself is extremely anxious, and we, the attendants, also feel that the future is bleak." This shows Mo's difficult situation. Yesterday morning, Wu Zesheng returned to Harbin from Liaoning. I went to inquire about the attitude of the highest authorities in the Northeast. He said that Commander Zhang Xueliang must go to Beijing to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek before a decision can be made. The Central Government is still largely ignorant of the conference situation. After the meeting, a suitable solution can be discussed. If so, the future of the Sino-Russian Conference does not lie with Russia or Mo, but depends on the meeting between Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang. Because there is no definite date for the resumption of the conference, Wu Zesheng and the four newly appointed special commissioners Qian Tai, Zhang Shou Zeng, and others have postponed their departure. The diplomatic messenger Fu Zhanwen will go to Russia on the ninth of this month to deliver winter clothes and food first. All the opinions about the Northeast were sealed in several letters and handed over to Fu by the Commissioner of the Border Defense Department to take away. Yesterday morning, Jin Ronggui, a counselor at the Directorate General of the Chinese Eastern Railway, went to Shuangchengbao and returned to Harbin in the evening. It is vaguely heard that Jin's mission is to visit Cai Yunsheng on behalf of Mo Dehui and ask Cai to mediate with Russia and help from the middle so that the conference situation will not remain so depressed for a long time. Cai and Mo have a relationship as in-laws, so they may be able to help. In diplomatic practice, there is no personal friendship involved, but Cai and Russia seem to be a different matter.

<h3 id="e75">The Russian Influence on the Chinese Eastern Railway is Gradually Expanding <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>▲ Preliminary Plan to Exclude Chinese Employees Through Examinations ▲ Reducing Chinese Laborers and Replacing Them with Russian Laborers</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The Soviet Union's operation of the Chinese Eastern Railway has used a chain-style plan in recent years. After one plan is implemented, another plan emerges, one after another. Since Mo Dehui is not in the country, the authorities are struggling to cope. After the deadlock in the Translation Department of the Railway Bureau, the Russian Director of the Railway Bureau proposed to the Council to implement examinations for all road engineering, mechanical, and rolling stock professionals throughout the road starting in January next year. All staff currently serving in the various engineering, rolling stock, and mechanical offices must take the exam, and only those who pass will be allowed to work in the Railway Bureau. If this method is implemented, at least thousands of Chinese employees will lose their jobs due to the exam. Chinese employees with specialized knowledge are originally few, and they are able to serve in various places because they are proficient in Russian language and speech and because they are rich in experience. The Russian side wants to achieve its ambition to control road affairs, so it excludes Chinese employees by means of examinations. Acting Chairman Li Geng, in the interest of the Chinese side, negotiated with the Russian friends and advocated waiting for Mo Dehui to return home to convene a formal meeting of the Council to decide. It is expected that this matter will not only violate the Feng-Russian Agreement but also affect the interests of the Chinese side and will inevitably become a dispute. In addition, the Russian Director also plans to reduce the room expenses and pensions of road employees in January next year, saying that it is to save expenses. The current salary system of the Chinese Eastern Railway is that each employee, in addition to receiving a monthly salary, is allocated a number of official rooms according to the amount of his salary. Those who do not have official rooms to live in are given 25% or 30% of their monthly salary for room expenses. Those who have been working in the road for many years and apply for retirement are given pensions, the amount of which is proportional to their length of service and salary. The road funds used for these two expenses each year are quite a lot. If they are reduced, it may not be a way to save money. However, it is heard that the Russian Director's intention is to reduce them uniformly on the surface, regardless of Chinese or Russian, but in reality, he will increase the salaries of Russian employees and pay them the original amount, and only reduce the amount paid to Chinese employees. This matter is related to the interests of more than 8,000 Chinese employees, and it is predicted that it will also become a major problem. Before the Railway Bureau plans to implement these two things, it has already started to cut Chinese laborers. The method is quite cunning. At the moment, there is a batch of Chinese laborers who are voluntarily resigning without leaving any traces of Russian repression. That is, 200 Chinese laborers in the Thirty-Six Zha were transferred to the Dieling Iron Factory to serve. The original salary of each worker was 2 yuan per day. After being transferred to the new factory, they would receive less than 8 jiao per day, and once they were transferred, the original amount of pension would be canceled. Most of the Chinese laborers have served for more than 20 or 30 years, and the amount of their pensions is not small. Naturally, they are unwilling to transfer to the new factory job and abandon their huge pensions, so they all resigned. After the Russian Director resigned the Chinese laborers, he transferred 200 Russian laborers from Hailar to fill the number. It is heard that the second and third batches of transferred Chinese laborers are being prepared. It seems that we have no words to protest this kind of passive conspiracy to reduce Chinese laborers. It is heard that since July, no less than 2,000 Red Russian employees have been added along the line. Their intentions are far-reaching. They want to gradually reduce the Chinese influence.

<p>▲ Zhu Mao's Rout to Nancheng and Shicheng</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Lu Diping, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government and concurrently Commander-in-Chief of the Ninth Route Army, has, with the successive recapture of Shanggao, Qingjiang, Xingan, Xinyu, Fenyi, and other counties by the First, Second, and Third Columns, and with Zhu Mao's forces, except for a portion entrenched in Ji'an, fleeing eastward in Jiangxi, urgently needing to be annihilated as soon as possible, led the headquarters of the Ninth Route Army and the First and Fifth Aviation Teams to Zhangshu this morning to direct operations. Accompanying him were Chief of Staff Xie Muhan, Secretary Cao Zhicai, Adjutant Tan Yinzhi, and dozens of others, as well as hundreds of members of the Provincial Government Guard and the Public Security Bureau Security Team. Lu took a Caisse aircraft to Zhangshu, and the other three aircraft also flew to Zhangshu at the same time, awaiting Lu's orders. Lu's staff and guards departed by motor vehicle on the Nanchang-Zhangshu road. It is heard that after Lu's arrival in Zhangshu, in addition to directing various units to attack Ji'an and recover the counties along the Gan River, he also plans to inspect the counties in western Jiangxi that have been afflicted by bandits. The duties of the Ninth Route Army Commander-in-Chief will be temporarily assumed by Chief of Staff Xiao, and the duties of the Provincial Government Chairman will be temporarily assumed by Committee Member and Secretary-General Yang Mianzhong.</p>
<p>Regarding the current situation of bandit suppression, after the main force of Zhu Mao moved to Chongren and Yihuang, attempting to flee to the Fujian border, the government troops also moved eastward to follow and pursue. The Gong and Luo Divisions are currently in Shanggao and Xinyu, and the Tan, Zhang, and Xu Divisions have a portion in Qingjiang and Xingan, and a portion advanced from Chongren to Fuzhou, joining forces with Deng Ying's Division. The battle lines stretch from Shanggao and Fenyi in the west, crossing the Yuan River and the Gan River in Xinyu, Qingjiang, Xiajiang, and Yongfeng, to Chongren and Yihuang in Fuzhou, a distance of several hundred miles. According to news from various sources in recent days, the main force of Peng and Huang is currently in Ji'an, Xiajiang, and Anfu, and the main force of Zhu Mao is in Chongren and Yihuang. The vanguard troops fleeing to Fujian have already reached Shicheng. Fuzhou was previously very dangerous, but after Tan's Division, Luo's Brigade, Zhang's Division, and Wang's Brigade arrived in Fuzhou from Zhangshu on the 14th, the situation has turned from danger to safety, and the bandits dare not attack Fuzhou. Currently, the troops of Deng Ying, Wang Jiejun, and Luo Shouyi are advancing towards Chongren and Yihuang to suppress them. Battles have broken out in Tangpu and Qiuxia. Firelight can be seen from Huangjiangkou, presumably due to the bandits burning houses. It is also reported that another part of the Communist bandits has reached the vicinity of Nancheng. Judging by their intentions, they will again flee from Ruijin to Tinghang. Lu has telegraphed the Fujian authorities, requesting them to quickly send troops to block them in western Fujian, to prevent them from escaping. (15th)</p>
<h3 id="e77">The General Situation of the Remaining Troops of the Jin Army <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>▲ Factional Disputes: Xu Yongchang Unable to Command</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: I traveled to Shanxi on business and stayed in Taiyuan for two days before returning to Beijing on the 12th. Along the way, I saw that the Jin Army on the Zhengtai Railway had Huolu as its front line, but only three companies were stationed there. Jingxing also had only a little over one battalion. Niangziguan had about two divisions, belonging to the Feng Pengzhu and Li Fuying units. Yangquan had about one division stationed, Shouyang had three regiments stationed, and Yuci had one regiment stationed. Inside and outside Taiyuan City, including the troops of Garrison Commander Rong Honglu and the remnants of various units that had retreated, there were at most only two or three thousand men. However, there were many military divisions, brigades, and regiments. Even those called divisions numbered more than ten. After the Jin Army's total collapse on the Henan and Shandong battlefields, in addition to those killed, wounded, and captured during the fighting, four or five out of ten deserted along the way. The number gathered in Shanxi province was generally small. However, those killed, wounded, and deserted were soldiers, not officers. Nine out of ten regimental commanders and above were unharmed. Therefore, after returning to Taiyuan, they still retained their original designations. Yan sent out twenty inspectors last month to go to various armies to inspect them. As a result, those who claimed to be an army had only several thousand men, those who claimed to be a division had only about a thousand men, and some who claimed to be a regiment had only one or two hundred men. Among them, the units that retreated from Shandong, such as Qin Shaoguan, Feng Yuxi, and Zhou Shilian, suffered the heaviest losses. After the inspectors reported back to Yan, Yan sighed and declared to the generals that their designations would remain unchanged, but military pay would be issued based on the actual number of personnel, and not based on the original designation. According to someone who spoke to me, the actual number of Shanxi troops currently existing is approximately as follows: 1. Sun Chu's unit, over five thousand men; 2. Yang Xiaou's unit, three thousand men; 3. Guan Fuan's unit, over four thousand men; 4. Wang Jingguo's unit, nine thousand men; 5. Li Fuying's unit, six thousand men; 6. Li Shengda's unit, two thousand men; 7. Feng Pengzhu's unit, four thousand men; 8. Yang Chengyuan's unit, four thousand men; 9. Yang Yaofang's unit, one thousand men; 10. Zhao Chengzhou's cavalry, five to six thousand men; 11. Zhou Dai's artillery, one thousand men; 12. Du Chunyi's guard brigade, five thousand men; 13. Other scattered remnants, totaling about three or four thousand men. Yan's remaining strength is only this much. However, Yan still wants to preserve these embers, so he pretended to retire and appointed Xu Yongchang as the commander of Jin-Sui, in order to maintain the remnant situation. However, Xu deeply knows the factional disputes within the Jin Army and has repeatedly declined, not daring to take office. When Zhang Xueliang arrived in Tianjin, Xu originally planned to go to Tianjin to meet with Zhang to discuss the aftermath, but just before his departure, many leaflets and slogans such as "Support Zhao Daiwen," "Support Fu Zuoyi," and "Down with Xu Yongchang" suddenly appeared in Taiyuan City. Xu then stopped. When Yan heard about this in Wutai, he immediately sent Gu Renfa and Shang Zhen to comfort Xu and invited Zhang Peimei to mediate, urging the generals to consider the interests of the Jin clique and cooperate with Xu. However, among the Jin figures with potential influence today, one is Zhao Daiwen, one is Wen Shouquan, and one is Shang Zhen. Zhao has his own plans and pleads illness when things happen. Wen is still in Shenyang. Shang has always been passive. If these three do not sincerely help Xu, I am afraid Zhang Peimei's mediation may not have any effect. (November 12th)</p>

<p>▲ Discussing the Reorganization of Railway Administration Issues</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Ministry of Railways believes that the vehicles of the Jinpu, Jiaoji, Longping, and Pinghan Railways were used the most during the military period and should be reorganized to improve railway administration. A few months ago, personnel were sent to conduct inspections and investigations. Now, Kang Deli, Chen Tao, Xu Changyin, Huang Lin, Tu Tang Dehua, and others have been dispatched to Xuzhou to convene a meeting of the four routes to discuss the reorganization of vehicles. Huang and Tang arrived in Xuzhou on the 8th, and Kang, Chen, and Xu also arrived in Xuzhou tonight (14th). The personnel sent by each route are: for the Jinpu Railway, Chief of the Car Management Department She Xu, Chief of the Audit Section Zhao Zonglian, Chief of the Car Section Zhang Youwei, Chief of the Locomotive Section Cheng Huating, etc.; for the Jiaoji Railway, Head of the Transportation Section of the Car Management Department Cao Changlin, staff member Cao Yi, Chief of the Locomotive Section Yang Heng, Chief of the Car Section Su Bubin, etc.; for the Longhai Railway, Chief of the Car Management Department Huang Fenggang, Deputy Section Chief of Xuzhou Xiao Xinwu, etc.; for the Pinghan Railway, Deputy Section Chief of the Car Management Department Jin Kewu, etc. They have also arrived in Xuzhou and are currently in contact with each other. It is expected that the meeting will be held on the 16th, after the Transportation Command completes its closure on the 15th. The Transportation Command has also drafted nine measures for reorganizing the vehicles of each route and submitted them to the headquarters for approval, to be proposed and discussed at the meeting.

<h3 id="e79">Anhui Provincial Government Revised Grain and Rice Tax Rates <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>▲ All Military and Other Additional Taxes Abolished ▲ Tax Payments Now Calculated Using the Decimal Yuan System</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Rice and grain are the main products of Anhui, with annual exports of no less than ten million shi. Therefore, rice tax also accounts for an important part of the Anhui provincial treasury revenue. The export rice tax rate in this province has been traditionally set at 1 fen 4 li per shi for the regular tax. After Anhui entered the military period during the National Revolutionary Army's Northern Expedition, the authorities added a temporary military fee of 5 fen per shi to the export rice tax. Although the military period has ended, this temporary additional rice tax has not been explicitly abolished. The Guangchao, Yanning, and other rice merchants stationed in Anhui, as well as the Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce, have repeatedly appealed, but have not been granted. In addition, there is an additional 1 fen 1 li 4 hao for the road debt fund, so each shi of rice exported currently requires a tax payment of 7 fen 5 li 4 hao. For other miscellaneous grains such as vegetables and wheat, the regular tax is 7 fen 5 li per shi, which, together with the road debt fund, totals 8 fen 2 li 5 hao. Although Anhui has had a bumper harvest this year, many other provinces have also had good harvests. As a result, the Guangchao, Yanning, and other merchants have not yet boldly purchased, and the rice market is sluggish, which is unprecedented. However, the prosperity and decline of various industries in Anhui have always depended on the rice market. If the rice market is weak, all industries cannot function. The newly appointed members of the provincial government, in order to take care of merchants' difficulties and revitalize the market, have recently decided at the provincial government meeting to abolish all additional taxes on rice, grain, and other miscellaneous grains. For ease of calculation, the tax will now be calculated using the decimal yuan system, based on the provincial land tax silver to yuan conversion rate, with each tael of silver converted to 1.5 yuan. The export rice tax rate is revised to 2 jiao 4 fen per shi, and the miscellaneous grain tax is 1 jiao per shi. Regardless of whether it is shipped by sail or steam, the new rates will take effect from November 11th of the 19th year of the Republic. In addition to the public announcement, the Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce has also been notified to inform all rice merchants. (14th)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Wuhu Quick Report <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>▲ Qiupu County in southern Anhui was captured by Shao Shiping's bandit gang from Jiangxi on the 5th. They searched every household, causing losses of approximately one hundred and tens of thousands of yuan throughout the city. More than twenty residents were killed. The provincial government dispatched troops to suppress them a few days ago, and they were eventually driven back, and the county seat was recovered.</p>
<p>▲ The Ministry of Finance has reassigned Yuan Jiapu, Director of the Anhui Finance Department, to concurrently serve as Anhui Finance Special Commissioner. Yuan came to Wuhu from Anqing the day before yesterday, took office on the 13th, and returned to the province today. Luo Jieqiu and Luo Peiwei have been appointed as chiefs of the second and third sections, respectively. Everything is currently being finalized, and it is planned to move the special commission to the province within a few days.</p>
<p>▲ The rent resistance movement in Wanchun Township, Wuhu, has not yet been resolved. Yesterday, the county government sent the arrested Cui Qifa and others to the province for review. It is heard that the provincial government strongly advocates strict handling of this case and has appointed Qi to come to Wuhu to handle it. The county government and the Sixth District Bandit Suppression Command have issued announcements, ordering that rent be paid at a rate of 140 catties per mu. If there is further resistance, troops will be sent to the countryside to forcibly collect rent.</p>
<p>▲ The Wuhu-Datong small steamship, which was robbed previously, suffered losses of over ten thousand yuan. The Sixth District Bandit Suppression Command cracked a bandit den in Ju Zhi'an the night before last, capturing several bandits and a pistol. This morning, a company of troops was sent on a special Wuhu-Datong steamship to Digang, capturing six male and female bandits and recovering many stolen goods. (14th)</p>

<p>Forced Divorce, Wife Killed with a Knife: Zhang Borong, a 24-year-old resident of Zhangjingqiao Township (Huai Shang Shi) in the seventh district, married Yan Aizhen, a 26-year-old, and they were very devoted after the marriage, having already had two sons. Recently, Zhang Borong suddenly became infatuated with a woman named Xiuqin from Bashiqiao, so he abandoned his old love for a new one. The day before yesterday afternoon, Zhang Borong sent someone to Yan's family in Zhaimen, falsely claiming that his wife was ill. Yan's father, Yan Xingchun, believed it to be true and rushed to Zhang's house to visit. Zhang Borong immediately forced a divorce. When Xingchun refused, Zhang rushed to the kitchen, grabbed a kitchen knife, and without asking why, suddenly slashed at his wife Yan Aizhen's head. Family members rushed forward to dissuade him, but she had already been injured in the neck, and blood was flowing profusely. Later, both sides went to the Seventh District Office for judgment.

Cai Rongsan, who sat and divided the loot, and Cai Aoda, who delivered threatening letters, were also his accomplices and were currently hiding in Caijiatang, about three li east of Zhengluqiao Township. Upon receiving the report, the branch chief, Jiao Jianping, immediately led a team of officers and police to Caijiatang to arrest them. Cai Hubao, Cai Rongsan, and Cai Aoda were all captured without resistance. After interrogation by the branch chief, Jiao confessed to having committed one kidnapping. The other bandits cunningly denied it. Yesterday (15th), a document and confession were prepared, and the arrested bandits Cai Hubao and others were sent to the county for trial.</p>

<p>17,500 Yuan in Cash Robbed En Route: The manager of the Yukang flower business in Hejiashi sent his partner Chen Mingkui to the city the day before yesterday (14th) to withdraw cash from the Bank of China. The bank conveniently handed over 17,500 yuan in banknotes. Chen Mingkui carried the money back to the village that evening on a Zhizhang ferry boat. However, Zhizhang is still several li away from Heshi. After arriving at the dock, one must disembark and walk. Unexpectedly, when Chen was walking near the Zhudian Bridge, he was suddenly surrounded by many robbers. They threatened him in every way. As a result, all the cash was robbed. Chen ran back to the store and reported the robbery to the manager. They then reported it to the fifth branch of the Public Security Bureau in the jurisdiction, requesting an investigation. The bureau has now dispatched a detective team led by Zhu Shunxiang to the countryside to investigate.</p>
<p>Bureau Chief's Gambling Raid Unsuccessful: Every year when the autumn harvest season arrives in this county, a group of idlers open gambling dens to absorb farmers' income, charging a heavy commission. The stakes are also high. Gamblers must be introduced by someone, and the dens are constantly changing locations to prevent information from being leaked. The most sophisticated gambling den is called "Lao Zuo." Recently, there have been rumors in society that certain institutions are providing subsidies. When Public Security Bureau Chief Wang Kunshan heard about this, he was very angry. The day before yesterday, he went out alone to the third garrison and led several patrolmen to Cao's house in Nanqingtang near the South Gate to raid a gambling den. (Cao's house is "Lao Zuo"). But the information was leaked long ago, and the internal structure of Cao's house was very winding. They were unable to find anything and returned in disappointment.</p>

<p>The Department Sends Someone to He to Investigate the Case: Dai Weizong, an inspector from the Department of Civil Affairs, arrived in He from the province the day before yesterday. The next day, he investigated various administrative matters with various agencies and public organizations. It is also known that Inspector Dai's major mission to He was because a certain agency in Hecheng was accused of wrongdoing. Therefore, the provincial government specially appointed Committee Member Dai to come to He to investigate each item in detail to serve as a basis for review. Therefore, Dai's whereabouts indicate that he will need to stay in He for several days. After each item has been investigated, he will immediately return to the province to report.</p>
<p>The Provincial Commission Comes to He to Urge Tax Payment: Jiaxing's past years' grain tax has been severely undercollected. Although the county government has urged officials to go to the countryside to collect taxes, the effect has been minimal. The reasons are (1) He has suffered consecutive years of famine, and the people have little savings. (2) Many businesses lease out land in exchange for grain rent. If the rent is not received, it is difficult to pay the grain tax. Due to these two reasons, grain tax collection has not improved. However, the provincial treasury urgently needs funds and has repeatedly telegraphed the county government to expedite tax collection. Zhu Zhaoping was also assigned to He yesterday to oversee the collection.</p>

<p>Zhu's Regiment Also in Charge of Suppressing Bandits in Shengzhou: The bandits in Shengzhou, eastern Zhejiang, are rampant, causing disturbances in the areas bordering Xinchang and Zhuji. Wu Zhulong, commander of the Sixth Regiment, personally led the suppression, and on the surface, they seem to have been dispersed, but they have not actually been wiped out. Therefore, the people of Xinshengzhu have sent telegrams to the central government. After receiving the report, the commander-in-chief learned that Zhu Mingtao, commander of the Third Regiment, was known for his bravery in suppressing bandits, and specially telegraphed the regiment commander to take charge of the suppression within a time limit of two months. Zhu requested instructions from the provincial government and would comply, as he had not received a telegram from the province and the defense zones had already been divided.</p>

The original notice stated: "With reference to a letter from the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee, regarding a petition from the Nanjing Municipal Executive Committee requesting the National Government to instruct the Ministry of Education to strictly prohibit religious subjects and religious ceremonies in all missionary schools to prevent cultural aggression, etc., the instruction was: 'Investigate and reply, return the original documents to the Ministry of Education.' In addition to investigating and replying to the previous case, the original petition is copied and sent to you for investigation and handling." It also attached the original petition.

If there are religious ceremonies in the school, students must not be forced or persuaded to participate. Religious ceremonies must not be held in primary schools. These regulations have been clearly stipulated in the regulations for private schools and have been repeatedly ordered and strictly enforced by the Ministry." "Local educational administrative agencies should have already strictly inspected and separately dealt with the schools established by religious organizations under their jurisdiction." "Now, with reference to the previous instructions, in addition to replying and distributing the notice, you are hereby ordered to submit a detailed report on the handling of the matter. At the same time, you should continue to supervise your subordinates and pay close attention to the propagation of religious doctrines in schools established by religious organizations.

<h3 id="e99">General Situation of Education in Baoying County <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Jin Yingyuan, an investigator from the Joint Preparatory Office for Compulsory Education in Various Counties of Jiangsu, investigated the general situation of education in Baoying. The following is an excerpt:</p>
<p>The director of education in Baoying County has been changed seven times in the past three years, which inevitably affects the entire undertaking. There are many accumulated arrears over the years. The reasons are: first, the expansion of undertakings exceeded the budget; second, there were two years of famine, resulting in a shortage of tax revenue (with the collection of 51%, the shortfall is estimated at more than 90,000 yuan). The accumulated arrears before the 15th year of the Republic were 21,550 yuan, the accumulated arrears in the 16th year were 66,000 yuan, and the accumulated arrears in the 17th and 18th years totaled approximately 91,960 yuan, totaling 179,510 yuan. The future remedial measures are: in terms of increasing revenue, starting from the 19th year, a request has been submitted to increase the general education land tax by two cents per mu, which is expected to generate 22,000 yuan. An increase in the tax quota is expected to generate 3,000 yuan, totaling 25,000 yuan. In terms of reducing expenditure, starting from the second semester of the 18th year, the budgets of various schools, museums, and administrative offices have been reduced by approximately 16,800 yuan. The budget for the 19th year has been reduced by approximately 22,800 yuan. If the two cents per mu of general education land tax that was not levied in the 19th year is collected, along with the tax quota increase and the budget reduction, the total will be 47,800 yuan. If the shortfall in tax revenue is gradually collected, the accumulated arrears can be cleared within two or three years, and the situation will improve. Director Zhou Songnan has only been in office for two months and is very enthusiastic about raising funds. He successively established the budget for the 18th year in July and the budget for the 19th year in August. New undertakings include: in terms of compulsory education, in addition to adding eight primary schools, ten classes have been added. In terms of general education, the county junior high school has added one grade, and the county No. 2 primary school has added one grade. In terms of social education, two public education centers, one simple library, one public education experimental area, and twenty-four public schools have been added. A farmers' education center is currently being prepared.</p>
<p>(1) Finances: The budget for the 19th year has greatly reduced expenditure. Regarding revenue, the surtax and collection taxes are 81,285 yuan, the surtax is 3,300 yuan, the special tax is 4,446 yuan, the miscellaneous taxes are 4,700 yuan, the property tax is 26,700 yuan, the tuition and boarding fees are 4,100 yuan, and the temporary income is 3,200 yuan, totaling 127,731 yuan. Regarding expenditure, the educational administrative expenses are 9,787 yuan, the general education expenses are 22,911 yuan, the compulsory education expenses are 43,194 yuan, the social education expenses are 22,994 yuan, the special income is 2,000 yuan, the contingency fund is 6,105 yuan, and the second contingency fund is 17,685 yuan. The county's educational expenditure was more than 3,000 yuan per month before the 16th year of the Republic. After the 16th year, the monthly expenditure suddenly increased to 8,300 yuan. In the second semester of the 18th year, the monthly expenditure was reduced to 5,500 yuan. This year, due to the increase in undertakings, the monthly expenditure is 7,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Compulsory Education: The county is divided into four school districts, with a population of 358,000. The number of school-age children enrolled is 2,270, and the number not enrolled is more than 58,000. There are 51 primary schools with 92 classes, costing 29,808 yuan. There are 620 private schools with 13,245 students. The number of students in each primary school is more than 30 for those with many students and 11 or 12 for those with fewer students, which seems to be a large difference from the number stipulated by the department. Each school also has a kindergarten class (with four rectangular tables and 12 or 16 people sitting around them). According to the investigation, most of them have reached school age and should be incorporated into the first grade for classes. As for children who have not reached school age, if there is no kindergarten to accommodate them, at a time when compulsory education funds are tight, there are as many as 50,000 school-age children in the county who are out of school, and it seems that rescuing these children who have not reached school age is still in the second step. The county's teachers include 39 graduates from normal colleges and senior high school normal departments, 22 graduates from old-style middle schools and senior high schools, 69 graduates from rural normal schools and county normal schools, 17 graduates from A and B type normal training classes, and 11 qualified testers. In the future, if funds are increased, one is to increase the land tax by two cents per mu, two is to measure school land and increase the rent, and three is to rectify miscellaneous taxes to increase the contract amount. For teacher training, it is planned to invite Yangzhou Rural Normal School to run a class every year. The survey of school-age children is still in the planning stage. The current compulsory education funds are used for consolidating old undertakings, amounting to 22,228 yuan, and for new undertakings, amounting to 9,998 yuan, with no savings. The general education land tax of 8 cents per mu has been finalized, and 6 cents has been collected. If the 2 cents that have not been collected can be realized, it seems that it should be fully retained and gradually promoted in rural education.</p>
<p>(3) General Education: There is one county junior high school in the city, with four grades (boys and girls are divided into groups in the third grade), 160 students, and 25 faculty members, with annual expenses of 9,600 yuan. The equipment for physics, chemistry, and natural sciences is very simple. The newly appointed principal has not yet taken office. There are three county primary schools with a total of 11 grades, one private Dunmu primary school with two grades, and one Lucun primary school jointly run with Yangzhou Middle School with one grade, totaling 14 grades. According to the investigation, there are many private schools in the city and countryside, and students often surpass primary school and enter high school midway. It is said that this trend has not diminished and may hinder the progress of compulsory education.</p>
<p>(4) Social Education: The county is divided into four public education zones, each with a public education center as the center. The first public education center is in the city, with 23 staff members and annual expenses of 6,876 yuan. The organization is divided into library, lecture, sports, promotion, science, art, general affairs, public reading room bi-weekly magazine editorial department, wall newspaper society, etc. There are a total of 24 active undertakings and 25 fixed undertakings. The second public education center is in Sheyang Town, divided into library and lecture departments, with monthly expenses of 82 yuan. The third public education center is in Sishui Town, divided into lecture, library, sports, and promotion departments, with an attached public library, with monthly expenses of 150 yuan. The first public library is in the city, divided into selection, cataloging, guidance, and administrative sections, with monthly expenses of 78 yuan. The number of daily visitors is very large. Other examples include the first zone of public schools with seven schools and eight grades (including women's classes), the second zone with two schools and two grades, the third zone with five schools and five grades, and the fourth zone with two schools and two grades, each school with monthly expenses of 15 yuan (once every four days). In addition, there is a joint improvement public teahouse in the north of the city. The county has all kinds of social education facilities. If it is not just an expansion of undertakings and seeks to enrich the content, it is truly good news for the future of social education. (The following is omitted)</p>

<p>▲ Request that President Li Return to the College Immediately to Preside over College Affairs</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Agricultural College of Labor University held an emergency meeting due to the resignation of President Li and professors. The following resolutions were made: (A) Request President Li to dismiss his resignation and return to the college immediately to preside over college affairs. (B) Issue a declaration clarifying that this incident was completely voluntary and was not used by others, and sternly refuting the unfounded and unreasonable insults against Fang Cheng and others. (C) Send a letter to some professors asking them to cancel their leave and come to the school to teach. (D) Request the Ministry of Education to quickly appoint a president. The meeting lasted for three hours before adjourning.</p>

<p>If the investigation proves the truth, it will not be difficult to legally punish those who make false accusations and threats. Otherwise, such acts of slander will never end. The thief had just left the victim's house, but shouted wildly to catch the thief, not knowing that he himself was the thief. The world is so dangerous and terrifying. This agricultural college dispute was caused by Mr. Li himself, and he cannot clean it up, so he uses this unfounded matter to blame others and escape. Is this the behavior of a gentleman? (3) Regarding the so-called secret agreement issue, Mr. Fang has been at home for more than three weeks and has never received any correspondence from the school. The letter states that he does not dare to respond to the students' request to announce to the students the content and evidence of the so-called secret agreement, and the student declaration states that the representatives of the student body sent a letter to Mr. Fang, which is like speaking with one voice. Is Mr. Li seeing ghosts near Sitang Bridge? When was a letter sent to Mr. Fang requesting him to announce the so-called "secret agreement"? At the last school affairs meeting, Mr. Li, Xiong Zirong, and Fang Cheng were elected to go to Nanjing to petition the government to quickly send a president and to visit Minister Jiang at the Ministry of Education's Minister's Reception Room. Mr. Li was responsible for the discussion, and Mr. Xiong assisted him. Mr. Fang only kept records, which were reviewed and signed by Minister Jiang, with eight articles in the main text and twelve articles in the appendix. These clauses have been announced in the newspaper in summary. The so-called secret agreement is a term coined by Mr. Li himself, and there is no need to re-announce it. Words are short and paper is long, and it is difficult to avoid omissions. The colleagues are not good at written disputes, but right and wrong should not be confused, and black and white should be distinguished. We respectfully express our innermost feelings and hope for your understanding. We wish you good health. Sincerely, Su Ruhuan, Chen Guorong, Wu Shuge, Zhang Lifan, Fang Cheng, Ma Shouzhen, Zhou Shili, Yi Gengfu, Zhang Nong, and 17 other department heads and professors of the Agricultural College.

<h3 id="e107">Portugal Defeats Luanhua <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Result is a Ratio of Eight to Two</p>
<p>The Luanhua and Portugal teams were at the bottom of the Westerners Association Group A standings with zero points each. Yesterday, the two teams played at the China Baseball Field. It was expected beforehand that the two sides were evenly matched and there would be a fierce battle. However, in the battle, Luanhua was clearly inferior, losing two goals in five minutes. The score was six to two in the first half. In the second half, Portugal scored two goals. As a result, Portugal won by eight to two.</p>
<h3 id="e108">▲ The Portuguese Team Fights Fiercely with Ten Players <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Ten minutes after the start of the first half, Portugal's right inside guard, Gang Shierfu, was injured and left the field. Afterwards, they fought with only ten players, but their momentum did not weaken. Luanhua not only failed to take advantage of the opportunity to win, but was scored four goals by Portugal. Luanhua only scored two goals. Before the end of the first half, Luanhua's Li Ning was injured in the face and also left the field to rest. From the beginning of the second half, each side fought with ten players, and the situation became more balanced. The lines became more disorganized and uninteresting. Before the end of the game, the audience left one after another.</p>
<h3 id="e109">▲ Luanhua Obtains a Free Kick <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Luanhua started the attack first. Portugal intercepted the attack. Right wing Xun Na rushed forward. Li Ning was about to step forward to compete when Xun Na passed to the front of the goal. The Portuguese center forward obtained the ball. Yang Renwei blocked the ball. The ball bounced to the right side. Fafanqie kicked the ball and scored the first goal. Not three minutes later, Portuguese center back Gu Shitan made a long shot from the left wing position and surprisingly scored a goal. Portugal was now winning by two goals.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Luanhua counterattacked. Portuguese right inside guard Gang Shierfu was injured and left the field. The strength of the back line was slightly weaker. Luanhua obtained a free kick next to the penalty line in front of the Portuguese goal. Li Huitang kicked the ball in. As soon as this ball went in, Portugal launched a major attack and scored another goal. After competing for a long time, Luanhua suddenly became brave. Five forwards surrounded the Portuguese goal. The Portuguese goalkeeper ran out to save the ball. A melee ensued. The ball suddenly fell in front of the goal. Wang Jihuai lightly pushed the empty goal, and the ball slowly rolled into the goal, making the score three to two.</p>
<h3 id="e110">▲ The Portuguese Team Wins the First Half with Six to Two <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>After the center kick-off, Luanhua suffered another heavy blow. Gu Shitan passed to the left wing, and then passed to the front of the Luanhua goal. Fafanqie coordinated from the middle. The right wing stepped in and kicked the ball in. The two Luanhua defenders were on the side, not stepping forward to compete, which was also a strange thing. In the next five minutes, Fafanqie scored two goals in a row. Luanhua's Li Ning was injured and left the field at this time. The first half ended immediately. Portugal won by six to two.</p>
<h3 id="e111">▲ The Lineup is Not Perfect in the Second Half <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>From the beginning of the second half, the lineups of each side were not perfect. Portugal scored one goal each by the Kolaisha brothers in the first quarter of an hour. From then on, it was messy and perfunctory until the end. Portugal won by eight to two. The referee was Jiang Xiangqing. There were about 3,000 spectators. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Portugal: Ge Tish, Maisaier, Gang Shierfu</p>

<h3 id="e117">Emerging New Japanese Tennis Players <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>▲Singles Player Sato (Naotaka) Defeats Old Sato (Taira) of the Davis Cup Three Straight</p>
<p>▲Doubles Team Sato (Taira) and Abe Eliminated Early in the Davis Cup</p>
<p>(Tokyo Correspondence) Recently, Japan held the 9th National Tennis Championship competition. More than 40 veterans and rising stars in the national tennis world participated in the competition. Among the Davis Cup players, reason for singles play and Ota were unable to participate due to matters. Sato (Taira), who served as the Davis Cup doubles player, volunteered to join the singles competition and participated in doubles with his original partner Abe.</p>
<p>Among the singles players, the most promising are naturally the veteran Sato (Taira), the Far East representative Sato (Buhei), and the 口 (name missing) who once defeated Sato (Taira). After several eliminations, the two Satos were left to hold the final battle on the 10th. As a result, the young Sato (who defeated Lin Qiu in the Far East Games) conquered the newly returned Davis Cup player, old Sato, with scores of six to four, eight to six, and six to two in three straight sets. The old Sato's serve was quite skilled, the position of the ball landing was also very good, and he was able to win with a calm attitude. It is a pity that the performance was not fully demonstrated. The young Sato is powerful, runs smoothly, and is especially capable of chasing and saving dangerous balls. He often returns the dangerous ball unexpectedly, making the enemy at a loss. If he can pay more attention to calmness, his future is limitless.</p>
<p>In the doubles, in addition to the Sato (Taira) and Abe team and the Yamagishi and Shimura team who attended the Far East Games, the Sato (Naotaka) and Kawachi team are the most promising. Unexpectedly, in the semi-finals, the Sato and Abe team was defeated by the little-known Kobe Commercial University Buhei and Kuwabara team. The latter also had smooth sailing and competed with Yamagishi and Shimura for the championship. Yamagishi and Shimura have been partners for many years, and their contact skills are very proficient, so that the enemy has no gaps to take advantage of. Buhei was originally known for his singles, and his personal technique was excellent, but Kuwabara repeatedly gave the enemy opportunities to take advantage of, and became the target of the enemy's attack, eventually leading to defeat. The result was four to six, six to four, six to three, and six to four.</p>
<p>Reporter's Note: The progress of the Japanese tennis world is extremely rapid, and new players are emerging in large numbers, with a daily changing momentum. It is hoped that our country's players will work hard to compete with them in the next Far East Games.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Party and Government Agencies Strictly Order Silk Mills to Resume Work <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Silk Mill Industry Association, Chairman Shen Huachen, Standing Committee Member Zhu Jing'an, etc., after going to the capital to request the government to issue silk industry public bonds, returned to Shanghai. Because the suspension of silk mills throughout Shanghai affected the livelihood of workers, a general meeting of all colleagues was specially convened to earnestly persuade manufacturers to find ways to resume work to maintain workers' lives. At that time, 32 companies were found who were willing to work hard to start work, but wages had to be reduced appropriately to reduce the burden. After the 11th, the factories separately convened meetings of employees to inform them of the situation of temporarily reducing wages and working hard to start work. The employees in each district understood the difficulties and were willing to cooperate sincerely. Therefore, the employees of the silk mills in each district went to work as usual without any objection. However, the nine silk mills, including Yuanfeng in the Hongkou District, announced the start of work the day before yesterday. Chen Zongxiang, an employee of Yichang, ordered all employees to sign a statement prohibiting machinists from starting fires, and threatened the factory owner. He was detained by the police and sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for detention. Personnel from the Party, government, and police agencies in the city were dispatched to find out the truth and ordered Chen Zongxiang to be detained for strict handling. At the same time, the nine silk mills were advised to resume work immediately, and the police were sent to protect them. It is now known that yesterday was Sunday, and each silk mill should have suspended work. The nine silk mills, including Yuanfeng, all prepared in accordance with the order and decided to resume work on the 19th. Yesterday, the industry association notified all employees to check. Yesterday afternoon, the East District Workers' Union held a special meeting at Changshi School to discuss ways to rescue Chen Zongxiang. The three Party, government, and police agencies in the city also jointly issued a notice yesterday and posted it in front of each factory to prevent further disturbances. The notice is copied below: Shanghai Special City Party Department Mass Training Association, Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Notice No. 4067, Joint Notice, According to the Shanghai Silk Mill Industry Association's report, the nine silk mills, including the Hongkou Yuanfeng Silk Mill, were advised by the association to start work on the 15th of this month. Unexpectedly, the Workers' Union convened the machinists and stokers of the nine silk mills in Hongkou, who are now planning to start work, and threatened them not to start fires and not to issue motive power, claiming that the twenty silk mills in Hongkou must start work at the same time, and cannot only start nine. Chen Zongxiang led many people to the home of Wu Gensheng, the foreman of the Yuanfeng Silk Mill, to prohibit him from starting a fire and forced the employees in the factory to sign a statement prohibiting work. Fortunately, the third office of the fifth district of the Public Security Bureau detained Chen Zongxiang. It was found that the employees and female workers of each factory have all understood, but the Workers' Union has come out to obstruct work, please investigate and handle it. It was found that the silk industry in this city was forced to close down due to the sluggish silk market. Now that we are working hard to find ways to open the factory, the responsible persons of the trade union should understand the difficulties and work together. But they are using this as an excuse to threaten and deter the resumption of work, which is very unreasonable. The council is deeply concerned about the sluggish silk market, which affects the suspension of silk mills and the lives of workers. For the future of the silk industry, we will take both into consideration and strive to ensure that both labor and capital get their due. I hope that you workers will accept the advice, resume work on a specific day, and if there are valid reasons, you will be allowed to submit them for verification. The overall goal is to take care of the lives of the workers and ensure that they can work with peace of mind. Anyone who obstructs work will be immediately arrested and severely punished. It is urgent to inform everyone to obey and not to disobey. This is the notice. Chen Junyi, Standing Committee Member, Yuan Liang, Director, Pan Gongzhan, Director, November 15, 19th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Petition of the National Private Electric Power Association <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>▲Government agencies must not hold provincial-run power plants again</p>
<p>The National Private Electric Power Association submitted a document to the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang to petition, saying, (omitting titles) "Respectfully reading Premier Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan, the focus of running industries is on food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Supplying household electric lights is designated as a type of residential industry. Furthermore, the outline of industrial and commercial administration states that preparing for large-scale private factories is to implement Premier Sun Yat-sen's military industry policy, but the state cannot hold private industrial and commercial enterprises that have already achieved success to avoid competing with the people for profit, etc." Electric power undertakings include electric lights, electric heating, and electric power. Electric lights and electric heating are supplied for household needs, and electric power is supplied for various motive powers, which is sufficient to improve life and increase production. Therefore, all private power plants should be maintained and promoted to promote their development. Last year, the private power plants across the country were taken over by the government one after another due to the Qi Shuyan Zhenhua Power Plant and the Hangzhou Dayouli Power Plant. Feeling a sense of imminent crisis, representatives were elected to come to Beijing to petition. The government listened to public opinion and promulgated the Regulations for the Supervision of Private Public Utilities and the Regulations on Electric Power Undertakings, the Registration Rules, etc. There are clear provisions regarding the business term and region to prevent disputes. Therefore, the maintenance of private electric power operators is complete and thorough. Unexpectedly, this year, the Guangdong Provincial Government overstepped its authority to reorganize the Guangzhou Commercial Electric Power Company, and the Zhejiang Electric Power Bureau has a plan to officially run a large power grid. The management rights, regional rights, and business rights of private companies are sufficient to cause great panic among private power plants, making them unable to operate with peace of mind. It has been repeatedly reported that official-run large power plants are actively proceeding with Gengzi indemnity and electrical public bonds. The location of their establishment is nothing more than in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang area. It is found that there are more than 100 private power plants in each province in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, which shows that the people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are leading the way and are still working hard to invest in private electricity. As long as the government provides guarantees and urges them to proceed, it is not impossible for private power plants to form a power grid, and government agencies can transfer their financial resources to other provinces that have not yet been established. Isn't it convenient for both parties? Otherwise, private operation in the front and official operation in the back is very easy to cause disputes. This year, our association sent representatives to Germany to attend the World Power Conference and investigate the electric power situation in various countries. We learned that its nature is purely private and local management. The term of the year has no time limit, or the shortest is 40 years, and the legal protection is even more thorough. As for state-owned, only the Soviet Russian government. It is found that the military affairs have come to an end, and the central government is determined to repair the internal affairs and promote industry to cultivate the national capital. Private power plants have been losing money due to years of war and commercial depression. If they are not actively maintained, it is difficult to avoid bankruptcy. Therefore, the reasons are briefly stated, and I beg you to maintain and protect the laws and regulations that have been promulgated for private electric power. I urge you to increase the term of the year to improve and expand the business as much as possible. To the area where private power plants have already been established, the country should not hold them again in the same area or nearby locations to dispel doubts. Whenever there is a need for reform, government agencies can only provide guidance or supervision on the law and cannot overstep the bounds to manage them to protect property rights. It is enough to uphold the Premier's industrial plan and conform to the main purpose of industrial and commercial administration. Presumptuously stated, I beg your judgment. The National Private Electric Power Industry Federation bows and deletes."</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Finance Bureau has received instructions from the Provincial Department to prepare for the collection of business tax registration fees, and appointed Bureau Chief Wang Li to also handle business tax registration matters. Bureau Chief Wang has already set up an office in the bureau and appointed Zhang Lingyi as the director of the office. He will start working immediately and start the work. In addition to sending a letter to the Minhang Chamber of Commerce to inform the commercial businesses to comply with the payment registration at the bureau, a notice was also issued yesterday, saying, "For the notice, it is stated in the 162nd appointment order of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance that the temporary regulations and implementation rules for the preparation of business tax collection registration fees in this province have been passed by the 340th meeting of the Jiangsu Provincial Government Committee and should be strictly implemented.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Industry Association's Committee for Maintaining Industry Regulations, because the case of requesting that all colleagues who have not joined the association should also abide by the industry regulations has been approved by the Federation of Industry and Commerce. In order to urge the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to expedite the return of the approval to handle the case, Zheng Chengqing, Luo Qinghua, Ye Jiaxing, Sun Choucheng, Yuan Hongjun, Mao Chunpu, Cheng Guichu, Ge Liangqing, Zhuang Meitang, and other nine committee members were specially recommended to go to Beijing on the 18th of this month to petition, and a temporary meeting was scheduled to be held today (the 17th) to discuss petition procedures.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Slaughtering Duck Operation, Civil Ship Repair Industry, and Soy Sauce Wine Shop Industry Associations sent a message to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday regarding the issue of industry association regulations compliance, saying, "Respectfully reading the report that the industry association regulations of the Nanjing National Government's Ministry of Industry and Commerce have been approved by the主管官廳, regardless of whether they have joined the association or not, all colleagues must abide by the case, which has been passed by the National Federation of Industry and Commerce and sent to your department for adoption and implementation. After reading it, I am very excited. Industry regulations are to adopt good habits in an industry to maintain and increase public interests and correct malpractices in business to jointly develop business. If the industry regulations cannot bind colleagues outside the association, there is an imbalance of rights and obligations in fact, and it is tantamount to announcing the dissolution of the industry organization. The associations feel the importance of the relationship of industry regulations and the urgency in fact, and they have specially sent a message to request that you adopt and implement them quickly to maintain unity and stabilize business. The urgent message cannot be waited for."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers and Employees Associations, after the expulsion of Liu Shufan, Director of the Postal Service, and the opposition to the establishment of a special bureau for postal savings and remittance, pushed to its breaking point, sent representatives to Beijing to petition together with Comrade Wu Kaixian of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department. When the central government and the supervisory, administrative, and legislative branches expressed their sincerity and accepted the representatives of the two associations, they returned to Shanghai to report and listen quietly to the central government's handling. It is now reported that the two associations have been holding meetings for a long time and have not received any instructions from the central government or information on how to handle the matter. The two associations held a meeting for many days and resolved to submit a petition to the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang to seek to implement the two major goals of expelling Liu and opposing savings. When necessary, they must continue to send representatives to the conference to make a final struggle. It is said that the petition has been drafted and will be issued today. In addition to the points mentioned in the petitions to the Central Party Department, the National Government, and the various branches of the two associations as reported in the previous newspapers, it is also stated that Liu's claim that "citing the successful methods of various countries and requesting the establishment of a special bureau for savings and remittance" is actually fabricating facts and deceiving the central government. According to the investigation by the trade union, there is no special bureau for savings and remittance in various countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Germany. The one separated in Japan is only a part of the savings, and the department has repeatedly separated and merged with the post office for 30 years. Even now, although there is a situation where the savings and deposits are too large and the establishment of a special bureau is insufficient to manage them, some people still advocate that although the post office and savings may be separated in theory, they must be merged in fact. Therefore, Liu's request to separate the special bureau for savings and remittance is only for the purpose of expanding his personal power and arranging private affairs, and there is no consideration for the future of the post office and savings and remittance.</p>

<p>The various tobacco exchange shops in Wangyun Road, Chengnei, including De Dachang, Yi Long, Fushunxiang, Wang Yongmao, Chen Defeng, etc., had previously had opinions and hung up signs to sell each tobacco at a low price, which was chaotic and unbearable. Qian Mujun, the owner of Yidahe in Zhaojiabang Road, in view of the long-term competition, loss of capital, harm to the whole, and far-reaching impact, specially invited the Tobacco Exchange Industry Association to mediate. Zhang Songji and other committee members were invited to persuade each shop separately to seek to connect feelings and avoid public anger and punishment and to conspire for public welfare. The signs were removed uniformly, and the shops have been selling in accordance with the industry association's price list.</p>

Each chamber shall send one representative, but if its average number of employees in the most recent year exceeds fifteen, it may add one representative for every fifteen additional employees. What exactly is meant by 'average number of employees in a year'?" Based on this, after investigating, the "average number of employees" mentioned in the original article should, in accordance with Article 8 of the Implementing Regulations of the Chamber of Commerce Law, the number of representatives of members of the Chamber of Commerce should be calculated by combining the total number of employees of the stores affiliated with the Chamber of Commerce. Of course, it refers to the average number of people employed by the stores affiliated with the Chamber of Commerce as a whole. For example, if the total number of people employed by ten stores affiliated with a certain Chamber of Commerce is over 150, then its average number of employees exceeds fifteen, and it can increase the number of representatives according to the regulations. If the total number of employees used by the ten stores is less than 150, then the average number of employees is below fifteen, and there is only one representative, etc. Because this matter involves explanation, it is urgently notified to all concerned.</p>

After several court hearings by Judge Huang Jie, the case was concluded and sentenced the day before yesterday. The murderer Qian Jisheng was sentenced to death for the crime of premeditated murder and deprived of his civil rights indefinitely. Zhou Wang was acquitted. After the verdict in this case, Qian Jisheng refused to accept the sentence and filed an appeal yesterday. The reason he gave was that he was indeed instigated by his lover Zhou Wang, and that's why he did it. It was not his intention at first. He met with the woman twice in Huatian and Yangmu Bridge to negotiate. The woman was an accomplice and should have been found guilty. Therefore, he was dissatisfied. After the judge Huang received the appeal from the suspect, he had already prepared the case files and sent them to the High Court for review.</p>

<p>Liu Guangcai, the live-in son-in-law of Wang Zhonglin, said that he has been living in his wife's family for a long time and has to be subject to their control. He discussed with his wife, Wang Caiyuan, about moving elsewhere. When Wang Zhonglin and his wife heard about this, they thought that this move by their son-in-law was inconsistent with their original intention of recruiting him as a live-in son-in-law, so they tried their best to stop him. Liu then filed a lawsuit with the Special Zone Local Court, claiming that his parents-in-law were obstructing his freedom and requesting permission to move elsewhere with his wife. During the hearing the other day, Wang Caiyuan testified that her husband wanted to leave her parents because he had other affairs. However, she really did not want to abandon her parents and go out with her husband. Her husband had taken away many of her clothes and accessories, and she requested that he be ordered to return them. Liu Guangcai insisted that his wife should live with him elsewhere. Judge Zhou ordered them to retire and wait for a scheduled sentence.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Xia Shaoen is the Assassin of Zhao Zheng <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Proven by Zhao Tieqiao's Wife▲Formerly a Patrol Team Soldier of the China Merchants Bureau</p>
<p>▲Dismissed Last October Due to an Incident▲The Reason for Assassinating Zhao was that He was Instigated by Someone</p>
<p>Xia Shaoen, the assassin of Zhao Tieqiao, the commissioner of the China Merchants Bureau, has been interrogated repeatedly by the County Public Security Bureau Chief Shen Jinghua after being brought back from Hefei, Anhui. His confession has been very detailed. There are now clues regarding the beginning and end of the assassination of Zhao, and it has been found that Xia Shaoen was a policeman in the Sixth District Public Security Bureau in the 17th year of the Republic of China and was changed to a soldier in the China Merchants Bureau's patrol team in the 18th year of the Republic of China. He was dismissed in October last year, but the name of Xia Shaoen still exists on the current roster of the China Merchants Bureau's patrol team. According to Xia's confession, the reason for assassinating Zhao this time was that he was instigated by someone. Director Shen took a photo of the assassin Xia to the Zhao residence on Rue Lupan yesterday. Zhao Tieqiao's wife personally identified whether he was the assassin, as Mrs. Zhao was an eyewitness at the scene of the incident. According to the results of the identification, it was indeed the assassin, and she saw him fleeing after firing the gun. Therefore, the beginning and end of the Zhao case and the content of its background should be revealed to the world in the next few days.</p>

<p>▲Open Fire if Not Given ▲Husband and Wife, Hu Yiyuan, Injured</p>
<p>Hu Yiyuan (also known as Datongyuan), a native of Ningbo, 54 years old, residing at No. 69, Jin Yang Lane, Pei Kai Er Road, Tilanqiao, has been a money exchanger at the pier and has some savings, which made him the target of bandits. Around 12:30 yesterday afternoon, two thugs, speaking the Shanghai dialect, wearing dark gray wool and cotton clothes, broke into his house and asked if Datongyuan was home. At that time, Hu was upstairs and answered. The robbers said, "The weather is getting cold, please lend us some money." After Yiyuan refused, the robbers took out a gun to threaten him. His wife, Zhou (47 years old), seeing this, shouted "robbers!" The robber then opened fire on her. Hu quickly covered her with his hand, and the bullet pierced his left arm. A stray bullet also wounded Zhou's lower body. Since it was noon, neighbors heard the gunshot and gathered. Fearing that detectives would come, the robbers fired another shot to show their power and fled. Nothing was lost in the house. Someone called the police at Station 1711, and they rushed to the scene and sent the two injured people to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Around 4 AM yesterday, an Englishman named Kincaid from the Hongkou Huishan Police Station came to the Si Hai Cafe on Broadway with a friend. After a while, three American women suddenly arrived. For unknown reasons, a dispute arose and both sides used force. As a result, people were persuaded to disperse, but they were still unwilling to let it go. Later, the patrol officer arrived and saw that Kincaid's back had been stabbed with a knife, several inches deep. The British policeman was not even aware of it, presumably because he was too angry. The policeman suspected that the Americans had done it and took the suspects back to the police station.</p>
<h3 id="e154">The Detective of the Water Police Team Acted Lawlessly <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>▲The Municipal Government Advised the Provincial Government to Move the Water Police Team Out of Shanghai</p>
<p>The Second Squad of the Third Team of the First District of the Jiangsu Water Police Team was originally stationed in the Beixinjing area of Shanghai. At the beginning of last month, He Zongyu (nicknamed "San Mazi"), who claimed to be a detective of the team, suddenly brought several people with him and handcuffed Chang Baoxian, who worked as a meal provider in the Xihua Yarn Factory, at 10 PM on the 3rd of that month. He accused him of being a communist suspect and demanded money. Chang's wife rushed to negotiate and paid 50 yuan to a Mr. Yuan, who gave it to a Mr. Feng, who then transferred it to Detective Dai of the team, before Chang was released. On the same day, Tang, Officer No. 6 of the team, sent five plainclothes detectives to the Tanjiadu Elementary School on Route Ghisi, Sixth District of Shanghai, and kidnapped teacher Cai Yiqun. Later, he entrusted someone to send a note with the address on it, asking for 300 yuan to redeem him. After the Sixth District of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau found out, they immediately met with Xie Yaozu, the captain of the Third Team of the Jiangsu Water Police, and went to the headquarters of the Second Squad of the Water Police. They indeed found a person named Cai Yiqun and asked the captain of the squad, Zhu Yanling, for the reason for the detention. According to reports, Chang and Cai were reported by Dai Guangru, a detective of the squad, based on information from informants, and were suspected of being communists, so he specially led the team. Captain Xie said that the squad leader had not reported beforehand, and the team headquarters was not aware of the matter, which was absurd. He immediately sent the squad leader Zhu Yanling to the team headquarters for inspection and took the detective Dai into custody, ordering him to hand over the informants for investigation. He also took Chang and Cai, and He Zongyu, who was accused of helping to arrest people, to the Sixth District and handed them over to the Public Security Bureau for preliminary interrogation. According to Chang and Cai, they were both arrested by the Jiangsu Water Police and extorted heavily. According to He Zongyu, he was instructed by Dai Guangru, a detective of the Second Squad of the Third Team of the First District of the Jiangsu Water Police, to arrest Chang and Cai and detain them upstairs in the squad for extortion. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau believed that Detective Dai Guangru had overstepped his authority and abused his power, which was unforgivable. The squad leader Zhu Yanling did not stop the detective from detaining residents for extortion, which was like kidnapping, and he was also guilty of harming the people and could not escape responsibility. The bureau immediately sent He Zongyu to the Shanghai Local Court for legal interrogation. It also reported to the municipal government to transfer to the Jiangsu Provincial Government that the Jiangsu Water Police Team had repeatedly arrested people in Shanghai without authorization, disturbed local residents, infringed on rights, and exceeded limits. Now that the squad leader Zhu Yanling, detective Dai Guangru, and others dared to openly kidnap people, the local public security was responsible and could not remain silent. The details were reported to the municipal government to transfer to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, ordering the team headquarters to be moved out of the Shanghai area and strictly ordering the direct superiors of the team to severely punish them to warn against illegal activities and maintain officialdom.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Zhou Yongkui Embezzled Consolation Money in the Car Accident Death Case <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>▲Du, a philanthropist, is worthy of admiration ▲Zhou Yongkui is truly insane and mad</p>
<p>At about 2 PM on the 1st of this month, a woman of about thirty years old was hit by a car near Songshan Road in the French Concession and sent to Renji Hospital, where she soon died. Her body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuantang morgue for examination. At that time, the deceased was found to be wearing a dark blue padded jacket and pants. Because there were no relatives, the mortuary coffined her, took photos, and kept her in the hall for claiming. The details were reported in the newspapers on the 2nd. Until the 3rd, after seeing the report, the family members, an old woman and a man, went to Fuyuantang to inquire. According to the old woman, her name was Chen Jin, 60 years old, from Fenghua, and currently lived at No. 223, Yuanfu Lane, Tangshan Road, Hongkou. On the morning of the 1st, her daughter-in-law, Chen Kangyuexiang, went out to collect money and never returned. She saw in the newspaper that a woman was hit by a car on Songshan Road and died, so she came to identify her. She pointed to the man who came with her, saying that he was her son, Chen Xiangzhong (34 years old), who was working as a waiter on a Citibank ship. The staff of Fuyuantang showed her the photos, and she identified that it was indeed her daughter-in-law. She immediately went to the police station. It was found that the driver of the car that caused the accident was named Yang Awu, and the car was owned by a Liu family. So, they requested justice. The driver Yang Awu said he knew a younger brother who was now working as a driver for Commander Liu Zhilu. Yang asked him to ask Commander Liu to ask Mr. Du Yuesheng to mediate. At that time, the family members consulted with relatives and friends. A friend of the same village, Mr. Jia, who worked as a tea room in the Asia Hotel on Sanma Road, heard about it and stepped forward, saying that Zhou Yongkui, a shareholder of the Asia Hotel, was very social and had a close relationship with Mr. Du. If he could be appointed to mediate, it would be resolved satisfactorily. They immediately consulted with Zhou, who readily agreed. The next day, he went to Du's residence on Avenue Haig, after submitting his card, Mr. Du, not knowing the person, asked his friend Yuan Shanbao and lawyer Jin Yu to meet him. After talking, he learned that he had come for the Chen family's matter. Mr. Du agreed to give 400 yuan as consolation money. The family members expressed their gratitude and agreed. Mr. Du entrusted this matter to lawyer Jin. The next day, Zhou Yongkui accompanied the family members to the French Concession to request cancellation of the case, then went to lawyer Jin's office to receive the consolation money. Lawyer Jin paid 400 yuan in full, and Zhou wrote a receipt as proof. Unexpectedly, after ten days, the family members did not receive a penny. They repeatedly asked Zhou, who made all kinds of excuses and even used intimidation. Fortunately, Chen had a cousin, Chen Chuanfu, who was a red gang tailor at the headquarters of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and was familiar with Mr. Qiu Zijia, a Shanghai gentleman. Knowing that Mr. Qiu was closest to Mr. Du, he asked Mr. Qiu to inquire about the situation. Mr. Du was surprised and asked Mr. Jin and Yuan. Lawyer Jin immediately showed Zhou's handwritten receipt. All three made it clear that they knew that Zhou intended to embezzle the consolation money. So, the night before, he invited Zhou to the Brahma Palace Garden Hotel and questioned him face to face. Zhou still fabricated excuses, saying that he had received the money but it was suddenly stolen on the way. Mr. Jin and Yuan were furious, saying that Zhou's attempt to embezzle the consolation money was insane and mad, and his behavior was worse than kidnapping and robbery. They called the police and arrested Zhou and took him to the police station. Lawyer Jin filed a complaint with the French Public Concession according to Article 356, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, requesting severe punishment.</p>
<h3 id="e158">The Result of the Lawsuit Involving Dalun Goods Hitting Reefs and Insurance Companies <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>▲Yu Ning Loses After Appeal▲Should Be Liable for Compensation</p>
<p>Last year, Dalun Company on Fuzhou Road, Xizhonghe Lane, delivered 30 pieces of cloth to the Pingfu steamboat to be transported to Sichuan. The goods were insured against water damage with the Asuxiulunsi Yu Ning Insurance Company on Hankou Road. Later, the Pingfu steamboat ran aground upstream of Yichang. The captain and others went ashore, and the goods on the ship were looted by local hooligans, who set fire to the boat. Afterwards, Dalun claimed the insured money from Yu Ning Company. The company believed that the incident was the same as piracy. The articles in the insurance policy clearly stipulated that piracy was not covered by insurance and refused to compensate. Dalun hired lawyer Shen Yuesheng to sue in the former Provisional Court, and the defendant lost the case. The defendant refused to accept and filed an appeal. The High Court Branch has completed the trial and concluded that the defendant's appeal was unreasonable and rejected it, and the judgment was sent to both parties. There are many concise words in the judgment, such as "This court ruled that pure piracy is not covered by the insurance scope stipulated in the insurance policy, but the looting in this case was entirely due to the steamboat running aground. In other words, if it were not for the running aground, there would be no looting. The running aground is the cause, and the looting is the result, so there is a causal relationship. The appellant should be liable for compensation for the damage."</p>

<p>Shi Mengying, a native of Changzhou, previously married Li Chundi from the same village. However, Shi had another concubine. After living together for several years, on July 1st of this year, Li and her lover Wu Linbing had a secret meeting in Room 7 of the Industry and Commerce Hotel in the French Concession, forgetting about home. Unexpectedly, their secret was discovered by Shi, who reported it to the French Concession. Detectives were ordered to arrest the adulterous couple and send them to the French Public Concession. After interrogation, they were sentenced to three months in prison. Shi also filed a lawsuit in the Special District Local Court, requesting permission to divorce, which has been judged to be allowed. All of Li's dowry was ordered to be returned. On the 11th of this month, Li's sentence was completed. After her release, she hired lawyer Lu Qi to file a lawsuit in court, requesting that Li's son Yin Cai, daughter Su Ying, and utensils and clothes be returned to the plaintiff. Yesterday, Judge Xu Wenrong opened a court to summon and interrogate. According to the defendant's agent, Shi Mengying, the defendant's brother, has passed away. One of the two children is being raised by him, and the other is being raised by his brother's concubine in the countryside. The plaintiff is a child bride and has no dowry. After mutual arguments between the lawyers of the two parties, the court ordered the debate to be concluded and set a date for pronouncement.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Widow Accuses Father-in-Law of Unequal Property Distribution <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The Cai Hongda dowry shop on Dongjie Street in Xiaodongmen, this city, is an old shop of more than 20 years. It was founded by Cai Lanzhou from Pudong, and its business is very prosperous, with very thick accumulation, and it is the leader in the dowry industry. Now Cai's eldest daughter-in-law, Cai Zhao, and her son Cai Qiyan Qian Baojing, have filed a lawsuit in the local court against her father-in-law Cai Lanzhou for unequal property distribution, concealment, and bias, requesting equal distribution according to shares. Her statement roughly stated that the plaintiff's mother and son, that is, the defendant's eldest daughter-in-law and eldest grandson, the defendant had three sons, the eldest being Jingxian, who died on the fourth day of the fifth month of last year, who was the plaintiff Zhao's husband and Guoqi's father, the second being Langxian, and the third being Chengxian. In July of the year before last, when Jingxian was still alive, due to separate living and cooking, the defendant allocated goods from the Hongda branch, about 6,000 yuan, as independent operating capital. Unfortunately, Jingxian died of illness in less than a year, causing huge losses. Hongda Jingji closed down as a result, leaving debts of about 20,000 yuan, which could not be cleared. At that time, the defendant was afraid of being implicated and proposed analysis as a preparation to resist the creditors' pursuit. Although there was a proposal to establish a basis for allocation, the assessed value of the property was too different, and many omissions were made, which was too biased, and the distribution was uneven, so the agreement was not approved and the signature was refused. The defendant had promised that once Hongda Jingji's affairs were clear, the distribution could be discussed again. Unexpectedly, creditors soon filed lawsuits one after another, and there were as many as nine civil and criminal cases, which completely sealed and sold all the property of the plaintiff's shop, and the compensation was settled. As a result, the plaintiff had no place to live, no food to eat, and life was difficult to describe. Therefore, a request was made for formal analysis according to the previous agreement. Unexpectedly, the defendant reneged on his previous words, using the previous analysis as a basis to resist and ignore it. It was found that the total amount of the defendant's own property, in addition to the capital surplus of Huatai Renji, which was about 12,000 yuan, allocated to his daughter, and the rest of the Hongda, Hongyuan, inventory, property, houses, bases, hui money, and shares, which were known to people, amounted to about 135,000 yuan, and 3,000 yuan was set aside for Chengxian's tuition. According to the original agreement, four shares were allocated, and each share should be 26,700 yuan, but the plaintiff, in addition to the previous receipt of 6,000 yuan for the inventory of Hongda Xinhao and the defendant's payment of 2,700 yuan for the case, still needed to claim 18,000 yuan, but was ignored, causing the plaintiff's mother and son to be separated and dependent on others, living with relatives, with no food or clothing, in difficult circumstances and life was difficult. The defendant, as the senior elder, and the proposer of the initiative to analyze, the plaintiff was the eldest daughter-in-law and eldest grandson, although one was a step-wife and the other was an orphan grandson, they were both juniors. How could they bully the widows and orphans alone, and embezzle the property that should be obtained, concealing and biasing, which was unfair to both reason and law, etc. The defendant Cai Lanzhou also hired lawyer Huang Han and submitted a defense, roughly stating that the plaintiff Cai Zhao had previously colluded with the creditors, hid shop goods, and fabricated 3,000 yuan in false accounts, and made unscrupulous demands on relatives, and that the shop's business was not well managed, leading to this failure, etc. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Keqian specially opened the seventh court to hear the case. The plaintiff Cai Zhao recounted the previous situation, followed by the defendant Cai Lanzhou, 68 years old, a local, with three sons, the eldest having passed away, and the third son, Chengxian, currently twelve years old, born to his second wife, while the eldest and second sons were born to his first wife. In 17 years of the Republic of China, when the eldest son Jingxian was still alive, he had already been divided, with three rooms allocated, each room receiving 8,000 yuan, but the third room received an additional 3,000 yuan as tuition fees in addition to the 8,000 yuan. (Question) How much property do you have? (Answer) Less than 30,000 yuan. I am now helping the youngest room, so I eat and use in the youngest room. (Question) Was there a basis for the allocation? (Answer) It was not established at the time, but it was established in September of the 18th year, when the eldest son had passed away. The judge obtained the statement and tried to mediate, but both parties refused, so they ordered both parties to invite relatives to mediate. If the mediation failed, they would reconvene on a scheduled basis and decide according to law.</p>

<p>A few days ago, the owner of Jiangdong Bookstore in Zhangchuan Alley, Yu Susun, reported to the Second District, First Precinct, that yesterday afternoon, he received a threatening letter sent by the post office, demanding to borrow 1,000 yuan in foreign currency, and arranged to meet at the pavilion on the sixth floor of the Little World from 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM on the 15th of this month, using umbrellas and perfume bottles as signals, etc. Because he was unable to comply, he reported for help and attached the threatening letter. After Officer Qian learned of the situation, he immediately notified Yu Susun to return to the store and continue business as usual, waiting for someone to be dispatched to accompany him to the meeting in order to arrest the suspect. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 15th), Officer Qian sent Inspector Qiang Yude, along with plainclothes officers and detectives, to coordinate with the Second Precinct of the First District to assist in the arrest. At that time, they were all disguised in plain clothes and went to the rooftop of the Little World, and sent detectives to hold umbrellas and perfume bottles, waiting specifically. Detectives were scattered everywhere. At 9:50 PM, someone walked onto the roof, as if strolling, and said to the disguised police (i.e., the one holding the umbrella and bottle), "If there is a strong wind, what are you doing here?" As the police were answering, Detective Tang Gengquan went upstairs and apprehended the person. After questioning, he claimed to be Zhang Chungui, currently residing at No. 7, Liangyi Fang. He said that he had returned to Shanghai from Hankou specifically to travel and have fun. Twenty-nine yuan in paper money and four jiao in Hubei provincial notes, a gold-cased watch, and a gold chain were found on his person. He was immediately escorted to his residence in Liangyi Fang for a search. There was only his elderly mother and younger sister at home, but his mother was out. Eighty yuan in paper money and a gold ring (engraved with his name) were found in a box. According to his sister, her brother had indeed returned to Shanghai from Hankou. At the same time, Chen Changfa came to knock on the door, asking what he was doing there so late. He said he came to visit his friend Zhang Chungui. When asked if he knew where Zhang Chungui came from, he said Hankou, but his words were evasive, and he was also taken to the precinct. Officer Qian questioned Zhang Chungui, who claimed that he had returned to Shanghai from Hankou because he had lost money in business in Hankou and came to Shanghai to find other opportunities. He said that the silver dollars in the box were given to him by his other sister, Huayuanyuan, who runs a brothel on Yunnan Road in the British Concession. He insisted that he was indeed sightseeing in the Little World and asked for a thorough investigation. Officer Wang Yufan was dispatched to Huayuanyuan's place for questioning, and it was confirmed that the statement was true, but the amount of money given did not match. However, according to Zhang Chungui, he was indeed sightseeing. Officer Qian felt that although it seemed ordinary, the timing was questionable and could not be rashly judged. It is reported that Zhang Chungui and Chen Changfa, along with the watch, have been sent to the Public Security Bureau for further investigation. It is also rumored that Zhang Chungui and Yu Susun are related by marriage.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Chop Off Index Finger Over Gambling Debt <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>▲Claims it's to Warn Himself in the Future▲Actually Intending to Extort</p>
<p>A local named Wang Gengsheng went to the Renhe Stockade in the Yangxing Street outside the Xiaodongmen in the French Concession last month to gamble, losing 50 yuan. When Wang tried to get the money back but failed, he cut off his own left index finger with a knife, repeatedly threatening. The stockade owner, Zhang Jinsheng, reported the incident, and Wang was arrested and taken to the police station. He was sent to the French Court for investigation the day before yesterday. The plaintiff, Zhang Jinsheng, recounted the previous events. When questioned, Wang Gengsheng admitted that he cut off his finger because he was desperate after losing money and wanted to warn himself against gambling in the future, denying any intention of extortion. Judge Zhu sentenced Wang to seven days of detention. Considering that his finger had already been cut off, the sentence was leniently suspended for two years.</p>

<p>▲Two Crew Members Rescued</p>
<p>Yesterday at around 10:00 AM, a sand barge was sailing through the Wusong Yunzaobang estuary when a ship from a certain company passed by, creating a large wave. The sand barge, because it was overloaded, was submerged by the wave and gradually sank. The two crew members, brothers Wang Deyun and Wang Deyou, fell into the water. Fortunately, they were rescued by the patrol boat of the Wusongkou Lifesaving Bureau and were not drowned. The sand barge has sunk to the bottom of the river and efforts are being made to salvage it.</p>

<p>▲Arrested by Detectives in Hospital Yesterday</p>
<p>Cheng Xianzhang, a 28-year-old from Xiuning, Anhui, was a clerk at the Yutai Pawnshop on Fangbang Road in the South City. It is said that the pawnshop was established by a wealthy Anhui merchant, and Cheng is a relative of the pawnshop owner, having worked there for almost five years. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 12th of this month, Cheng suddenly stole gold and pearl jewelry worth six or seven thousand yuan and fled. The pawnshop sent out detectives everywhere and reported the incident to the police station, requesting assistance in the arrest. Yesterday, Li Dingyuan, a detective from the Second Precinct of the First District of the Public Security Bureau, learned that Cheng had initially hidden in the Central Hotel on Six Horse Road after stealing the stolen goods, staying there for several days, and then moved to Room 13 of the Nanyang Hospital in the South City. Detective Li quietly went to the hospital and arrested Cheng, along with police officers Cheng Rufu and Ma Jinyuan. He was taken to the Second Precinct of the First District. After a detailed interrogation by Chief Ma, he was immediately prepared to submit the case to the court for review due to the large-scale theft.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Autopsy of Murder Case in Changan Lane <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>▲Deceased was Prostitute Li Shuangfeng</p>
<p>The female tenant of a kiosk room at No. 2 Changan Lane, next to the Weiyang Grand Theater on Annakin Road in the French Concession, was killed by her lover the day before yesterday. The murderer locked the door and fled. It was not until after 12:00 PM that the landlady's maid, Wu Wangshi, discovered the body and informed the landlady, Xie Zidan, who reported the incident to the French police. Detectives were dispatched to investigate. A prostitute's tax certificate with the name Li Shuangfeng, aged 28, was found in the deceased's short jacket pocket. The detectives took the certificate back to the police station and transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan morgue for an autopsy. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Detective Bao found that the deceased was indeed named Li Shuangfeng, 28 years old, from Liyang. She used to be a prostitute at the brothel run by Chen Yuanshi (the current landlady's daughter-in-law) at No. 69 Aige Road. Recently, she and her lover, Wang A'er, rented a kiosk room in the remaining house of the Yuan family, her old employer. Yesterday, the Criminal Section of the French Police reported the case to Judge Zhu, who arrived at the scene at 2:00 PM for an autopsy. Detective Bao explained the previous events. Chen Yuanshi also stated that she was willing to pay for the coffin and funeral arrangements. Judge Zhu ruled that the deceased, Li Shuangfeng, had indeed been stabbed to death with a knife and approved Chen Yuanshi's request to provide a coffin for the burial. The police station was instructed to investigate and photograph the body for the record. When the police were photographing the body, a sailor's knife with a deer bone handle, about two inches long and with a sharp, bloodstained blade, fell from behind the deceased's head and neck. It is believed to be the murder weapon and was taken back to the police station for safekeeping. Chen Yuanshi then prepared clothing and a coffin for the burial and temporarily placed it in the Yangzhou Guild Hall.</p>

<p>Dong Mingde, the leader of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau Detective Team in the South City, received a tip-off the day before yesterday that a group of robbers, including Fu Xiaoyu, were holding a secret meeting at No. 444 Hongfu Lane, Yongxing Road, Zhabei, plotting illegal activities. He immediately led detectives Hu Haishan, Ren Shouzhi, Yu Maolong, Lü Anpu, and Xu Yulin to the house. They apprehended six people on the spot: robbers Fu Xiaoyu, Sheng Yujun, Wang Agui, Wang Sunshun, Yuan Hezhu, and a female robber, Wang Xias. They were all taken back for questioning. Fu claimed to be 35 years old, from Ningbo, and residing at No. 4 Jiuru Lane, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. He confessed that at around 5:00 AM the day before yesterday, he and Chen Gongbao, Wang Agui, and Wang Sunshun carried pistols to the home of Wang Tongsheng at No. 23 Dachang Lane, Nanmatou, and robbed them of cash and jewelry worth approximately 800 yuan. He had sent 201 yuan of the stolen money and dozens of bullets to his second landlord, Wang, but Wang had absconded with the money upon hearing of the robbery. On another occasion, he and Wang Sunshun robbed the Xinhongyu Wine Shop at No. 13 Nanmatou of over 200 yuan and clothing. About a month ago, he and his friends Lin Geng robbed the home of Du Xian at No. 3 Runde Lane, across from the Nanshi District Court, of about 300 yuan worth of property and jewelry. Later, he and others robbed a certain family on Yuezhou Road, Yuezhou Lane, Beishi, of over 300 yuan. All of the money had been divided and spent. Wang Agui, 38 years old, from Fenghua, stated that he lived at No. 444 Hongfu Lane, Yongxing Road, Zhabei. Wang Sunshun, 44 years old, from Fenghua, and Yuan Hezhu, 32 years old, also from Fenghua and a tailor by trade, all confessed to the details provided by Fu. Sheng Yujun, 35 years old, from Ningbo, who lived at No. 8 Huachang Lane, Qiujiang Road, stated that he had only recently met Wang Agui. On the 13th of this month, he was playing mahjong with his neighbors at home when Wang Agui suddenly brought two pistols and secretly hid them in the stairwell of his house. He was initially unaware of this, but after being informed by his wife, he was shocked. He went to Wang's house that day to urge him to take them away, but was arrested instead. Wang Xia, 45 years old, from Fenghua, said that she was Wang Agui's wife and that she was the one who pawned or exchanged the jewelry and clothing obtained from their illegal activities. The police then went to Sheng Yujun's home and recovered two pistols, and to the Qinghua Silver Shop on Haining Road, where they recovered two gold bracelets and three gold rings that were part of the stolen goods. They also retrieved stolen clothing from various pawnshops. The case was submitted to the Third Section of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for investigation yesterday.</p>

<p>Mr. Xing Guangshi from Haimen County, Jiangsu Province, invented a rough draft of the spinning machine, which has been seen in this newspaper a few days ago. Now, let's introduce the details of his ten years of hard work and management as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Xing Guangshi lamented that our country's yarn industry was still young and that profits were flowing overseas. He also saw the current situation in Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces, where cotton was cheap and yarn was expensive. Therefore, he was determined to invent the most convenient spinning machine to make it easy to promote and sell throughout the country, benefit the people's livelihood, and enrich the country's economy. He then temporarily suspended the research on the invention of the Earth's gravity machine and devoted himself to the work of the spinning machine. Previously, our country already had the manufacture of this yarn machine, but all of them failed because the yarn was uneven in thickness, often broke, and the part for winding and storing cotton strips could not be solved. Mr. Xing then came up with his own ideas, only to deduce the principle of artificial yarn spinning in our country, and engaged in creation and manufacturing. He manufactured the part for winding and storing cotton strips separately. After painstakingly researching and transforming it dozens of times for seven years, he made a wooden eighty-spindle yarn strip machine and a carding machine each. However, it was still not perfect, and the family property was exhausted, and there was no ability to continue. It was suspended for one year. At that time, Huang Changding happened to meet Mr. Xing at the home of Aunt Yang, who was also Mr. Xing's maternal uncle's family, and then they met. After talking, they made a friendship. They learned that he had invented the yarn machine, and it was suspended due to economic difficulties. Huang couldn't help but regret it. At that time, Mr. Huang had something to do in Bianluo, so he resigned from his job and cooperated with him to plan the progress of the machine. Mr. Xing was responsible for manufacturing, Huang was responsible for economy, and planned everything. In the summer of the Republic of China in the seventeenth year, the Haimen area was not peaceful, and the residence was located in a remote rural area, and the transportation was blocked, which was extremely inconvenient. So he moved to Chongming near Shanghai to continue the research, and submitted an application to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for registration. The Ministry ordered the Shanghai Office to send Shou Senxiang, Chen Jingsheng, and Niu Wenyuan to Chongming to test the actual spinning, which was quite satisfactory. However, the carding machine was still in Haimen, and the whole picture was not seen. The Ministry ordered the entire machine to be remade of iron because the machine was made of wood before further processing. Mr. Xing had worked hard for seven years and achieved such results, which was not easy. How could he have the extra strength to remake it? Only because the official orders were there, he could not look forward and backward, so he disregarded the dangers ahead and took risks to proceed, invited workers to engage in remaking, shuttled between the stove fire and the file, either personally or verbally instructed. If there were any difficulties, they would try to solve them to seek improvement. Then he added an insurance mechanism to ensure that the spinning could be continuous. In the summer of the eighteenth year, it was about to be completed, but there were no drawings yet. Yuan Weiqing, a high-achieving student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Jiaotong University from the same township, was interested in studying. During the summer vacation, he was invited to Chongming to draw detailed drawings according to the size of the machine. He discussed a lot with Mr. Xing in March, and there were some modifications in between. The hot summer steamed people, and sweat was like rain. Mr. Xing attached great importance to it without rest. In terms of economy, Mr. Huang was responsible for it, but Mr. Xing was also a poor scholar who sold his fields and property to help. Even if he borrowed money from Zhou Shudian, it was still difficult to make ends meet. In order to save money, he recruited rural coppersmiths with low wages to manufacture them. The major casting parts were made by Shanghai Iron Works. Therefore, the parts were extremely crude. Even a small hook often had to be modified and remade four or five times. The parts remade in Shanghai were also out of shape, and had to be filed and padded in many ways to barely assemble them, which made Mr. Xing very anxious, fearing that it would not be able to spin yarn. Just when the yarn strip machine was about to start, the yarn tube lever was shortened by the workers due to negligence. There was no way to lengthen it with his luggage. As a result, he was mentally stimulated, and also witnessed Mr. Huang's embarrassment due to raising funds. He was given extreme unease, resulting in reduced food intake, haggard appearance, sleepless nights, and was about to collapse. The group persuaded him to save energy and rest, and then he was admitted to Shanghai Xusheng Hospital on October 8. After Chen Xusheng's meticulous treatment, his illness was slightly relieved, but his vitality was greatly depleted, his food intake was small, and he was unable to get out of bed. Just when he was celebrating his gradual recovery, he suddenly had cerebral congestion at 4 pm on October 20, which lasted until 9:15 pm. People in the whole city were shocked and mourned for it. At that time, the yarn strip machine had been assembled, but it had not been started yet. Part of the carding machine had not been assembled yet. Huang invited workers to start assembling it. Fortunately, it was successful, and the yarn strips were very uniform, clean, firm, and tough, which was beyond Mr. Xing's expectations during his lifetime. However, due to the crude parts, it was difficult to be very flexible. If all the original drawings could be followed, each part would be flexible, and the results would be even more impressive. The drawings and instructions were submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for registration. The Ministry was examined by the Industrial Products Reward Review Committee. Then, he received the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Order No. 2135, which said, "For the purpose of following the order, the supplementary payment of Guangshi Spinning Machine drawings should be handled together. It has been sent to the Industrial Products Reward Review Committee for review, and instructions have been given. According to the report of the committee, the structure of the machine is quite ingenious. However, according to the description in the manual, the cutting part is currently equipped with two knives to cut the lint. It should be ordered to modify the lint cutting part of the carding machine and then submit it for inspection." This order was issued because the lint cutting part of the carding machine had not been completed. Because the machine has been successful, but it still needs to be sorted out and improved to be perfect. In the scientific community, it should stand on a special position, and should not be registered hastily for profit. The Engineering Research Institute of the National Central Research Institute was invited to test it. The director Zhou Zijing and Wang Jitong went to test it and praised it greatly, and sent a public letter No. 167, "Sincerely, I have received your letter saying that Xing Guangshi has invented the details of the spinning machine, and please send someone to Chongming to conduct an on-site test to assess it. The director of this institute has accompanied researcher Wang Jitong and textile expert Deng Bangti to conduct a detailed examination of its working condition at the installation site on March 20 and 21, and record the important dimensions, speeds, etc. for discussion. According to the report of the two experts Wang and Deng, if we can continue to study and improve it, it can be applied to areas where cotton is produced but no yarn factories are set up. In addition to copying the original report for delivery, a corresponding letter is hereby replied. Please check it." (See the Monthly Report of the National Central Research Institute, Volume 1, No. 10) Now I heard that Mr. Huang, in order to make the machine perfect, plans to hire experts to sort it out, and contact various parties to raise funds, set up factories to manufacture and promote it, which is really the gospel of our country's industrial sector. Its office is temporarily located at No. 33, Yan Matou, Nanshi, Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e176">The Financial Gold Market Fluctuated Violently Last Week <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>▲The gold market was extremely volatile last week. On Monday, the big bank had already lowered its interest rate to 0.0625. Bank of America reduced its interest rate by 0.0125. The standard gold price was still stable in the morning. Then it was heard that Chase Manhattan had dropped as many as 6,000 cash loans. Therefore, people were mentally weak, and large households sold them, plunging more than four taels, and falling to 80 taels. By the afternoon, there seemed to be more buyers, and it was heard that the cash issued by Chase Manhattan was borrowed by Hengxing. The price was on the rise again, totaling more than 85 taels, and closing at 5 taels and 3 qian, which was 2 and a half taels higher than the previous Saturday. There was a difference of 6 taels and 2 qian on that day. The next day, the big bank only reduced the long-term interest rate by 0.0625. It was ordered not to move the previous market, and the later market suddenly changed to reduce the interest rate by half a grade. The internal market was also tight, and the industry was scrambling to settle. As for the gold market, it was firm in the morning and became stronger in the afternoon, reaching 89 taels and 5 qian, because large households were chasing in, and the exchange rate was repeatedly reported lower, especially the peers were psychologically expecting the cash ban to be relaxed. On Wednesday, it suddenly rushed out of the 90 taels mark, and people in the market were firm and bullish, probably because the deadline for the ban on cash exports had arrived, so they imagined that the ban would be lifted, and various firms such as Da Decheng Yuan Mao Yong Zhi Feng Yong and others bought in one after another, with some short covering, so the afternoon reached 92 taels. As a result, it fell sharply by 1 tael, totaling 90 taels and 9 qian, which had risen for three consecutive days, totaling 8 taels and 1 qian. However, the difference on that day was not huge, only about 4 taels, probably because the big bank slightly reduced the interest rate and the foreign exchange market seemed tight. Although the big bank lowered the interest rate the next day, the Japanese-British and Japanese-American markets were lower, so the gold market was initially suppressed, but the foreign exchange market was weak, and speculator Wu sold it. However, Yongheng covered a short position of about 3,000 for Luo, so the price was still able to stand at the 90 taels mark. After the first order and other orders were relaxed, and the sellers were not lazy, they broke the 90 taels mark. The market once looked good in the afternoon, because the bulls deliberately released air, and the swap rate should be raised to 6 or 7 taels, so the shorts did not dare to underestimate it and made some replenishments, and then coaxed it to 91 taels, but the result was again softened to 88 and a half taels, which was 2 taels and 4 qian lower than the previous day, which was the reverse direction of the three-day rise. The silver market rebounded the next day. The first order was extended by half a grade, and the internal market was also tight, so the gold market opened lower. Then it was suddenly heard that Japanese Prime Minister Hamaguchi was assassinated and seriously injured, so people were suddenly mentally weak, and large households sold it, and it plummeted to 81 taels and 2 qian. Later, according to the Osaka telegram, although Hamaguchi's injury was dangerous, there was no danger to his life, so the market situation turned peaceful again, and the swap rate was privately opened by the industry. After the authorities of the exchange persuaded him not to listen, it was raised from 4 or 5 taels to 7 taels, so the market price has been pulled up by more than 6 taels, totaling 87 taels, 5 qian and 6 qian. However, the result was still 1 tael and 2 qian lower than the target day. There were 7 taels and 4 qian changes on that day. Saturday happened to be the official swap rate, which turned from high to low. In the morning, the off-market price was initially 7 taels, and then it fell to 4 or 5 taels, and then from 5 taels to 3 taels. The Dalian gang bulls have all swapped it properly, but it is said that some firms have not swapped it all, and there is no entry or exit in December. Basically, it has been changed to the January period. However, the closing price was 80 taels and 9 qian, which was based on the January listing. Compared with the previous day, it fell by 6 taels and 4 qian, which has been falling for three consecutive days, totaling 10 taels. For half a month in January, there were 5 taels of ups and downs, which had retreated to within 80 taels. The transactions of each firm are still many, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday's London telegram said that the big bank silver had rebounded. Local Chinese and Indian buyers bought in, and the closing price was flat. The recent rebound was 0.0625, which was 16 pence and 75 cents (equivalent to 1 shilling and 7 pence and 8125 cents in British gold). The long-term rebound was also 0.0625, which was 16 pence and 625 cents. The New York telegram said that the price of American silver also increased by 0.0125, and the spot price was 26 cents and 25 cents. The British currency fell by 0.03125 against the American currency, and the American currency rebounded by 0.03125 against the British currency, both of which were 4 yuan, 8 jiao, 5 fen and 625 cents. The Japanese-American and Japanese-British markets did not move. The London-Shanghai first order was shortened by 0.0625, which was 1 shilling and 7 pence and 5625 cents. The Bombay spot price increased by 1 anna, which was 47 rupees and 14 annas.</p>

<h3 id="e179">The Bond Price of Securities Rose Sharply Last Week <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>▲The troop reduction and demobilization continuation rose by about three yuan ▲The tariff rectification of 619 tariff also rose sharply</p>
<p>The trading situation of various bonds in the securities market last week, except for Wednesday, when only 5 million and several hundred thousand was the most calm, the first two days of the week and Thursday each reached about 8 million yuan. The weekend was particularly good, and the market popularity was very active. The daily turnover reached more than 12.5 million yuan, and the total turnover for the week was 5,465,000 yuan, which was 9 million and several hundred thousand yuan less than the previous week. Among them, the entry and exit of the 19 tariff, demobilization and troop reduction were more active. The 19 tariff was 7.45 million yuan in the November period and 9.15 million yuan in the December period. The troop reduction was 4,085,000 yuan in the November period and 5,865,000 yuan in the December period. The demobilization was 4.43 million yuan in the November period and 5.35 million yuan in the December period. The 96 was still lively, with 3,755,000 yuan in the November period and 6.61 million yuan in the December period. The rectification of 6 was slightly better, with 1,445,000 yuan in the November period and 1,960,000 yuan in the December period. The others were still calm, such as the 19 year cigarette, with 890,000 yuan in the November period and 490,000 yuan in the December period. The aftermath was 745,000 yuan in the November period and 30,000 yuan in the December period. The 7 year period only had a turnover of 35,000 yuan in the November period. The financial sector only opened 25,000 yuan in the December period, and continued with 25,000 and only 5,000 yuan. There was still no transaction in the continued roll. The spot market was still sparse, with only 74,300 yuan for the whole week, including 25,500 yuan for the 19 tariff and 21,000 yuan for the demobilization. The others were only several thousand yuan. As for the trend of the price of each bond, because the situation was getting better day by day and the military affairs had entered the collection period, and the sorting out of domestic and foreign debts had been formally discussed, the credit of the bonds was more stable than before. Therefore, the interest in investing in public bonds in the market was also consciously strong, and the demand for each bond market was greater than the supply, which was more stable than the previous week. As for its changes, except that the 96 rose too much in the previous week, and a large number of sellers surged, the price fell by 1 yuan and 78 jiao on Monday, and then returned to a high price. The others were generally based on the market's needs and hovered to a high price. The trend was very uniform. The two types of domestic troop reduction and demobilization were the most collected by all parties, and the rise was also the greatest. The troop reduction futures rose by 3 yuan and 67 jiao, and the demobilization rose by about 3 yuan. The rectification of the 6 tariff and the 19 year tariff were also quite good, but the aftermath was always very sluggish. The future of the bond market is still optimistic. The statistics of the high and low rises and falls of each bond price within the past week are listed below. (Unit: Yuan)</p>

<p>▲The local scene is weak and stable···There is absolutely no motivation for real needs</p>
<p>The yarn market showed a rather uneasy state last week. In fact, there were too many bottom goods, and the 20 count Five Fortune and Shepherd goods were thicker. The demand from various spot yarn gangs was dim, and there was no activity from all parties. As a result, people's hearts were exhausted, and it was difficult to support the scattered sellers. A part of the manufacturers adopted a negative attitude and settled half of the long positions. As a result, the platform became looser, and the low peak was close to 144 taels and 2 qian in the near month and 148 taels and 1 qian in the distant month. Later, it was said that there was a short squeeze in the November raw cotton, and the market situation rose. The yarn market was brought up by it, and the profit makers covered their short positions, and each month rose again. As a result, it rose by 1 tael to 7 or 8 qian compared with the previous week. The total turnover for the week was 78,600 bales. The spot yarn gangs bought a total of 6,835 bales. The market started to fall and then rise. The number of bales bought by each gang is recorded below.</p>
<p>Gang Bale Amount Gang Bale Amount Gang Bale Amount</p>
<p>Inland 1,350 Xuzhou 150 Guangdong 1,600 Xiamen 80 Yunnan 270 Jiangxi 145 Shantou 620 Wuhu 80 Yantai 55 Qingdao 250 Hankou 165 Luzhou 205 Tianjin 250 Sichuan 1,410 Miscellaneous Gang 215 Peer 400</p>

<p>▲Each month is good for 7 or 8 qian···The current cotton consumption continues to be weak</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, the cotton market was slightly boosted because the US government's estimate was released and reduced. Unexpectedly, it suddenly fell by 35 pounds of sound the next day, and the market price suddenly fell by 4 or 5 qian. The buyers were hit again. However, because the number of transactions in this month was too large, the delivery was insufficient, so the bulls had a lot of short squeezes. The market situation gradually tightened, and the Ningbo gang and the Shanghai gang vigorously purchased in the distant month. The market atmosphere became more and more tight, and the buyers took the opportunity to raise the price. The November issue exceeded 3 taels and 1 qian at the weekend, but the foreign cotton market situation was calm. The standard cotton results rose by 7 or 8 qian each month. The total turnover for the week was 262,500 dan, but the spot cotton business in the market was quite clear. The Japanese factories did nothing, because the Indian cotton was full. The cotton market is currently too scattered, and the sources from all roads are smooth in the future. There are still huge changes in the market. The total amount purchased by each factory is 34,660 dan. The source is 8,500 bales of Yaohua and 3,100 bales of Tonghua. The American cotton fell by 5 pounds of sound compared with last week. The purchase amount of each manufacturer and firm is recorded below.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was uneven due to the bad news from Liverpool. Spot traders bought in. The futures rose and fell by one to five pounds of sound. The spot fell by five pounds of sound. The British cotton futures fell by four or five points. The spot rose by four points. The Egyptian cotton spot rose by five points. The Indian cotton market situation was sluggish. The Pingle did not move. The Aomura and Bairoxi fell by one rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 15th).</p>

<h3 id="e183">The Food Rice Market Turns to Hover <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>▲More than 30 gangs arrived in Zhabei yesterday. The market sales were not very consistent. The price of new japonica rice tended to be stable. The middle grade felt slightly firmer. The general trend did not fluctuate much. However, the cargo customers unanimously called for a higher price due to the cost. The top price opened at 15 yuan and 4 jiao, and the ordinary price was 14 yuan and 8 jiao. The situation of thin rice was peaceful. The top goods in the market were sparse, and the ordinary situation was stable. The top price opened at 14 yuan and a half. The sales of both Yangdu and Ke Xian were consistent. Although the sources were scarce, the sales were not very expanded, so the market price still opened at 13 yuan and zero, which was similar to the previous day. The Ke Xian Bu Guan Tip retail was active, and the sales market was not lonely. The market was firm. The bian yuan continued to be weak, and the top price opened at about 15 yuan. The Yin Yuan's exit was more stagnant, and the arrival of goods was very close. The high opening was 12 yuan and 2 jiao, all above the small two jiao.</p>
<p>▲More than a dozen river boats arrived in South Shanghai yesterday. The sales were very active at first, and then slightly faded. The sales of the top grade new japonica rice were uneven. The top goods were tight due to the seller's sale, and the high opening was 14 yuan and 9 jiao. The middle grade was stable due to the buyer's batch cut, and the general market high japonica rice opened at 14 yuan and a half. The buying of Su Tong white japonica rice turned into shares, and the price was good, about half a jiao. The Tong Li japonica rice opened at 12 yuan and 7 jiao. At present, the market situation of both japonica and thin rice is quite different. The trend has shown a hovering pattern, so the price of both thin and white rice in South Shanghai is still rising and falling unevenly, but the situation seems to be getting better. The top opening is 13 yuan and 6 jiao. The situation of Yang Xian Du Tip is average, and the price lacks honor and disgrace. The highest opening is 12 yuan and zero. The Yin Yuan market is extremely calm, and the sales are slightly more active. The general market opened at 12 yuan and 1 jiao, but the follow-up is still difficult to turn around.</p>
<h3 id="e184">The Sugar Market Is Quiet and the Coarse Sand Is Fatigue <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>▲The Japanese sugar price falls and turns firm</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegrams, because it was Sunday, there was no telegram. The guild market allocated the market. The buying of the 24th grade coarse sand white sugar and Dutch sugar was still quiet. The asking price was 7 taels and 7 qian. The 20th grade medium sand white sugar was 6 taels and 8 qian. The fine ground sand white sugar was 7 taels and 8 qian. The transactions were all sparse, and the market was bleak. The entry and exit of Japanese sugar were also sparse. The N mark was 7 taels and 7 qian. The J mark was 8 taels, which was still no rise or fall compared to before. The YP mark was 7 taels, 7 qian and 2 fen and a half. The YT mark was 7 taels, 6 qian and 2 fen and a half. The YRO mark was 7 taels and 1 qian and a half. The Meiji goods were 7 taels and 05 fen, which was slightly lower than before, but the sellers were still tightening their prices, so the market atmosphere turned slightly stable. There were 90 packages of domestic goods and half of the South Qing goods opened at 6 yuan and 2 qian, and the market was very tired. The foot ice has arrived, and the next market is 11 taels. A few transactions were made, and the market was still firm, probably because the market inventory was very thin.</p>

<p>▲ Total value estimated at 300,000 taels of silver</p>
<p>Woolen fabrics and broadcloths are currently selling well. Local and out-of-town merchants continue to demand them. The guild reports a very positive trend. Selling prices, both overt and covert, remain firm. Merchants throng to foreign firms daily to place orders and take delivery. It is reported that woolen fabric shipments last week totaled 500 cases, split roughly equally between those from Puxi and Pudong warehouses. Most were destined for ports such as Niuzhuang, Tianjin, Bianhan, Sichuan, and Xiamen, with fewer going to inland merchants and local businesses. Overcoats and heavier woolen fabrics accounted for half of the shipments, with the remainder consisting of "Zhizhi," broadcloth, fancy tweed, chocolate-colored cotton flannel, and 1.6-foot woolen felt. The total value is estimated at 300,000 taels of silver.</p>

<p>▲ Lyons sales stagnant...New York cables show prices declining ▲ Japanese silk price drop unabated...Shanghai mills find it difficult to sell at low prices</p>
<p>Last week, the silk market in Shanghai's foreign firms became increasingly lifeless. Since the financial crisis in Lyons and Marseille, the raw silk market has been virtually without transactions, compounded by severe flooding, which has led to increased mill closures and even weaker silk sales. While New York factories are interested in spring silk futures, the low prices of Japanese silk are fiercely competitive. Cables from China report high prices, resulting in few transactions and declining prices, particularly for Shanghai-produced silks. Economic instability is also evident in Yokohama and other locations, with approximately 60% of silk mills ceasing operations. European sales of Japanese silk have plummeted, and the price decline remains unchecked. Shanghai manufacturers universally report capital depletion. Government bond issuance is still pending. Officials are earnestly encouraging mills to resume operations to maintain employment. Currently, mills are exploring ways to resume production, but their existing silk inventory was acquired at higher costs. The current market is weak, resulting in substantial losses, making sales difficult. Transactions for Sichuan and Anhui silks are also scarce, with only about 100 bales of spot trading throughout the week. Silk exports are limited to 400 bales. Overseas Chinese silk prices have fallen sharply. The following is a list of Chinese silk prices in the U.S. and French markets at the end of last week (New York prices are in US dollars per pound; Lyons prices are in French francs per kilogram):</p>
<p>Silk Type   New York  Lyons   Silk Type   New York  Lyons</p>
<p>Superior Shanghai Silk   2.95    290   Superior Anhui Silk   2.00    173</p>

<h3 id="e189">In Memory of Aviator Li Fengxuan <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiping</p>
<p>Years ago, when I was a guest in Xiamen, Fujian, I knew two famous aviators: one was Mr. Chen Wenlin, and the other was Mr. Li Fengxuan. Chen stayed in Germany for many years. Last spring, he flew the "Xiamen" aircraft from Europe back to China, covering over 50,000 miles, setting the first long-distance flight record for a Chinese pilot. The naval authorities subsequently appointed him to the important position of director of the Xiamen Aviation Office. Li studied in the United States in his early years, mastering the art of flying. Upon returning to China, he served as an aviator in Guangdong Province. In 1926, he joined the Northern Expedition and made many outstanding contributions. When the "May 30th Incident" occurred, overseas Fujianese in the Philippines were angered by the rampant behavior of the Japanese and sought ways to serve their country and save their people. They initiated an aviation school in Xiamen to train talents for the nation, and they hired Mr. Li as an instructor. Both Chen and Li were from Xiamen, and they served their hometown together. Thus, almost all Fujianese knew of these two outstanding figures. The two gentlemen were childhood friends, and we became good friends at first sight, regretting that we had not met sooner. During our leisure time, we often went on excursions together, sharing our innermost thoughts and discussing the past and present. Our friendship was unmatched.</p>
<p>Last winter, I left Xiamen to return to my hometown. When bidding farewell, Chen held my hand and said, "I will be traveling to Fujian tomorrow. You are leaving a day earlier than me. I must write a song of farewell, otherwise, we will surely miss each other." Unfortunately, Brother Fengxuan had affairs in Zhangzhou and Longyan, soaring through the sky and working hard to suppress the communists. Knowing of your journey, he asked me to convey a word to express his regret at our parting. I said, "This gentleman is truly sentimental." We laughed together and parted. This spring, I had business in Shanghai, and my southern tour was canceled. Although we could no longer have the same joyful gatherings as before, exchanging letters was enough to ease my feelings. Last month, Li sent me a letter from Guangdong, detailing the merger of the Xiamen school into the Guangdong Aviation School this autumn and his promotion to chief instructor. He said that he trained students daily, soaring through the clouds, and his enthusiasm was greater than ever. He also said that the military order had been issued, and he would soon set sail to conquer Guangxi and eliminate the rebels. He would provide a detailed report after his triumphant return. His lingering feelings overflowed between the lines. I was celebrating this gentleman's talent and youth, when tragic news arrived. Mr. Li encountered an accident on the morning of the 4th of this month on the Dasha River in Guangzhou. At first, I did not believe it, but after receiving a quick letter from a friend in Guangdong detailing the incident, I confirmed it through news reports and finally understood. Alas, this man suffered such a fate. It can be said that an extraordinary person suffered an extraordinary disaster. How tragic was this?</p>
<p>According to the letter, the accident was due to a mechanical failure, not a lack of skill. The aircraft he was flying was the "Asia-Africa-England" No. 6, which was transferred from the Xiamen school to the Guangdong school. Mr. Li usually flew this aircraft and was extremely familiar with its operation. Who knew that when flying at an altitude of 2,000 feet, the engine suddenly broke down, and the tail cable also snapped simultaneously, causing it to be impossible to propel forward, rotating and falling down. Thus, the tragic accident happened. Is Mr. Li's death destined by fate? According to the post-mortem examination, Mr. Li and his companion, Liu Quan, were tightly fastened to the aircraft with leather belts. Therefore, when the aircraft sank to the bottom of the sea, it was difficult to escape. If they had not been wearing these belts at the beginning of the accident, they would have been able to float and survive. Perhaps Mr. Li did not pay attention to it in the panic. What is even more painful is that the aircraft could not be retrieved immediately after it sank. Four fishing boats were hired to cooperate with military electric boats to use nets to salvage it. It took two hours to lift the aircraft. The mechanical parts were not greatly damaged, but the bodies had turned color and swelled, with blood flowing from the facial features. The sight was unbearable to witness.</p>
<p>Mr. Li was upright in nature, resolute in his actions, and did not decline from hard work or complaints. He was a rare find among his peers, only thirty-five years old.</p>
<h3 id="e190">A Record of the Third Municipal Elementary School Sports Meet <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>Recently, the largest meeting in the country was the Fourth Plenary Session, and the largest meeting in Shanghai was the Third Joint Sports Meet of Municipal Elementary Schools. One is a major national event, and the other is a major event for elementary school students. Both events opened on the anniversary of the birth of Sun Yat-sen, which can be said to be a distant counterpart. In terms of the number of participants and the grandeur of the situation, the latter actually surpassed the former. However, the nature is different. The Municipal Elementary School Sports Meet is held annually, and the reporter is fortunate enough to participate each time. How fortunate it is. The anecdotes of previous sessions have been recorded in this column. Now, I will continue to present them on the left.</p>
<p>▲Comparison of Past and Present: The joint sports meet of Shanghai municipal elementary schools began in the autumn of 1928, when Wei Pengdan was the director of the bureau and Wang Zulan was the director of the second department. The president of the conference was the director of the bureau. The second session continued to do so. However, the director of the bureau has been replaced by Chen Daiqiu, and the director of the department is Ni Wenya. The leader of Shanghai education changes every year. When he delivered the opening speech, it was full of emotion. The cost of the conference was 1,000 yuan for the first session, 900 yuan for the second session, and 700 yuan for this session. Efficiency and funding are not directly proportional. 64 schools joined in the first year, 62 last year, and this year there are 61 municipal schools and 23 private schools. The most spectacular assembly exercise had 3,714 participants in the first session, 4,445 in the second session, and 4,516 in this session. The audience was twice as large as before, exceeding 20,000 each day. The Two Jiangs Women's Physical Education School suspended classes for three days to attend the conference, which shows its grand scale.</p>
<p>▲A Glimpse of the Venue: The rostrum faces south as before, with no changes compared to the past. The characters "Sports Meet" are hung in the middle of the plaque. Next to it is a couplet that says, "Boost your spirits and see who achieves true athletic success in these three days. Continue to train and strive to become healthy and strong citizens of China in ten years." The track is to the north. Each school's seats are arranged in advance, like pigeonholes, surrounding the four sides of the venue. The hawkers shouting at the top of their lungs are clustered in the gaps. Although the seats have been arranged, cuckoo nesting on magpie nests has been observed in reality. The importance of order and discipline in sports seems to have been forgotten. The rest areas are separated for men and women, and the children resting there are no different from a refugee map. The enthusiasm of these children cannot be matched by adults. Thinking of Bai Juyi's poem, "At twenty, one begins to grow up. At thirty, one begins to age. The color of peach and plum in the mirror cannot last for ten years," I feel even more emotional.</p>
<p>▲Square Table Takes Revenge for Round Chair: Before the assembly exercise, the students stand in a row, singing the Party song and the sports meet song. Zhong Zitong is invited to conduct. Mr. Zhong stands on a platform made up of three tables, singing and gesturing energetically. After the song, he is pleased with himself. He jumps from the platform to the table, and the round chair is crushed because he is too fat. The audience is filled with surprise and joy in the tense atmosphere. When Wang Huaiqi takes the stage again to perform a model exercise, one of the legs of the highest square table suddenly tilts, threatening to collapse. The situation is serious. The staff rushes forward to hold the four legs of the table, which is comical. People say it is a new-style human pyramid. The reporter says that the round chair was innocently trampled on, and the square table is taking revenge for it.</p>
<p>▲Sports Meet and Bathing: In recent years, the Songjiang Girls' High School has won the most awards in the women's division of the Jiangsu Provincial High School Sports Meet. The school's athletes, Fu Xuezhen and Lü Tianzhi, are now teaching at a certain municipal school this summer. They led the athletes, Zhu Songju and Qian Yunlan, to participate in the event, predicting that their results would be good. After all, strong generals have no weak soldiers under their command. However, the two were disheartened and said to the reporter, "China has been running new education for more than 30 years, and sports meets have also been held for more than 30 years. There are tens of millions of sports meets of all sizes across the country. However, Chinese people are still stooping and hunching, and their faces are still pale. It is still impossible to develop the habit of bathing once a day, like in England, America, and Germany. What about sports meets? What about sports meets?"</p>
<h3 id="e191">New Chrysanthemum Poetry <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Wenru</p>
<p>Why is it called "new"? Today's chrysanthemums are different from the chrysanthemums of the past. Today's people's attitude towards chrysanthemums is also different from that of the people of the past. That is, the flower is an expression of the person. Readers of my poems will not be far from understanding.</p>
<p>Adopting elegance and criticizing at will, vulgar people diligently examine the classics. Don't say that culture is truly swept away, they can still pick out flower themes. (There are still many types of chrysanthemums today. Vulgar people, showing off their culture, often add comments. The text is not related to the topic, which is ridiculous. My friend, Mr. Pan Gongzhan, also has a commentary sentence, which is quite elegant in its wording. If benevolence is superior, then learning may be the case.)</p>
<p>Born to be parasitic on fences, purple, white, yellow, and red each express their strangeness. Occupying the ninth autumn, they boast of their appearance. Laughing at when will their old age be. (What was once called cold fragrance and secluded beauty has now changed its original appearance. Try to question it with the sentence "Lonely, proud of the world, with whom to hide" in the Red Chamber. The chrysanthemum has no words to answer. Alas, things are like this, how can people bear it?)</p>
<p>Disgusted to enter the hermit's home back then, lamenting the warmth and coldness of the world in general. Hot officials and wealthy merchants arrange banquets for appreciation. This is also a rich and noble flower in the human world.</p>
<p>Grand gatherings are opened, displaying ten thousand pots. The city government calls for them, surpassing mountain villages. Don't say that the price of yellow flowers is cheap, a single look can win one yuan. (Shanghai's Nanjing Road is holding a chrysanthemum exhibition to collect famous varieties for viewing. The ticket price is one yuan. Recalling that when foreigners established this meeting a few years ago, the example was three yuan. Now it has been reduced by more than half.)</p>
<p>Silently harboring hatred, it is pitiful to be born. No wonder heaven indulges in worldly sentiments. Purity is specially taught to reside in muddy places. Knitting their brows and complaining bitterly to Tao Yuanming. (The beautiful scenery of the Eastern Fence has also changed, appreciating the praise of hot officials and wealthy merchants. If Tao Yuanming were still alive, he would also have to give up his love.)</p>
<p>Peaceful times in the Eastern Sea have many new images, while a bleak Western River reveals cracks. Asking the surviving elders, can the pine and chrysanthemum of Sang Sang still exist?</p>
<p>Discussing where to build a thatched hut, walking is too unbearable in the thorns. I have no share in picking the dew and flowers. It is difficult to find Chrysanthemum Pond to avoid Qin.</p>
<p>Who planted miscellaneous species at the door, countless autumn appearances, long for children and grandchildren. Intermingled colors openly surpass the correct color, startling to see the yellow race lost its soul.</p>

<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>The car moved southwest very slowly, stopping frequently. There were hardly any villages, all on mountain peaks, rising above the ground at an altitude of 1,700 to 1,800 feet. Looking down, the mountains were all below the car, an endless green sea. Half bamboo, half trees. If a paper mill could be built, I wonder if it would be suitable. The poem says:</p>
<p>The railway car travels south, mountains filled with bamboo forests. An endless green sea swayed, listening to the chirping birds at will.</p>
<p>Few thatched huts and wild people, tangled vines and dense trees. Knowing that it is a secluded place, the waterfall roars like a dragon's song.</p>
<p>These natural forests have no owners, all taken over by the government, so their benefits are endless. On the way, I occasionally saw men and women planting things on the mountain tops, carrying knives. In this place, one cannot defend against snakes and beasts without carrying a knife. At seven o'clock, we arrived at Namtu. Red and white Western-style houses, lit by electric lights. The mountain slopes were all flat. The mountains of northern Burma have no steep cliffs, so they are most suitable for planting. Not like the high and steep mountains of Hong Kong, which are harsh on people. Namtu is vast and wide, completely within the scope of a silver company. Only the rich have their own cars. There are no other cars to be found. Luggage is carried by porters. Initially, I thought that the Burmese in Yangon did not know how to carry things on poles, and I had not seen anyone wearing a hat. In northern Burma, they wear hats and there are many carriers. Their hats are made of large bamboo skin, beautiful and strong. Passing a large bridge, the water flowed very quickly. I stayed at the residence of Liang Jinshan, who is the famous "Old Man Liang," from Yongchang, who commanded more than 2,000 workers, contracted railway projects, and earned 100,000 to 200,000 at a time, becoming rich. He is generous, and highly respected in the labor community.</p>
<p>Zhang Dexi enthusiastically told me that six or seven stations from Namtu, and four or five stations from Lashio, in the northeast, there is the land of the Five Kalias, residing between the English and the Chinese. The area is a thousand miles, rich in silver mines, and also has gold. Wu Sangui once operated it in ancient times. Recently, the British and Americans have been coveting it. According to the mining engineer, its silver is ten times that of Namtu. The British once went to mine it, but were rejected by the Kalia people. When Chinese go to mine it, the Kalia people kill cows to welcome them. Many of its people are Muslims. It is now possible to find ways to exploit it. I agreed very much. Zhang's father made a map of all of Burma, detailing the products, especially the five metals and precious jade produced in northern Burma.</p>

<p>▲Pilgrimage to Italy Diary</p>
<p>(3) Ten Days in Rome (9)</p>
<p>Day Two—Colosseum—Arch of Constantine—Baths of Caracalla—Catacombs</p>
<p>When the Roman sun shone brightly, we left the Baths of Caracalla together, boarded a carriage, whipped the horses forward, and followed a winding path, leaning against the Esquiline Hill, turning into a grove of green trees, and then ascended a steep slope, which seemed to be a hill, neatly lined with delicate cypresses.</p>
<p>"Catacombs!" the carriage driver shouted loudly behind us. We hurriedly got off the carriage and stepped on the traces of the year 100 AD, the so-called underground chapel of the "Catacombs."</p>
<p>Entering the Church of Saint Sebastian, we saw the former tomb of Saint Sebastian, with a white stone statue of Saint Sebastian lying there. He seemed to be looking back at us, wondering how these few Chinese youths, who do not follow religion, could come from afar to pay homage. We walked back and forth in the solemn and gloomy church, circling a few times. We saw several stone carvings of the life of the Virgin, filled with clusters of lilies on the altar and in the shrine. The only impression was a clean and mysterious one: clean. It was truly a pure land, nothing else. I really couldn't imagine that prosperous Europe would also have this quiet and extinct phenomenon. In this lonely hall, only one devout pilgrim was kneeling before the ruined altar, murmuring. We stood still, lingering, somewhat hesitant. Just as a young monk came out of the room next to the tomb of Saint Sebastian, we stepped forward, bowed our hands, and asked:—</p>
<p>"Are the underground chapel and the underground tomb here?"</p>
<p>He replied, "This is it."</p>
<p>So he led us into the warehouse-like, dark gray door and gave each of us a white candle like a penholder, had us light it, and then, holding the key, we entered the catacombs and went into the so-called underground chapel of the Catacombs.</p>
<p>"This is where Saint Sebastian preached on that day. This is his statue."</p>
<p>The monk who led us held the dim candlelight in his right hand and pointed up and down with his left finger as he spoke.</p>
<p>The monk told us many legends of Saint Sebastian, the stories of all the believers being greatly suppressed and persecuted, and some myths.</p>

<h3 id="e195">A Word of Respect to the Canadian Trade Delegation (Pan Gongzhan) <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Canada and our Republic of China, located on the east and west sides of the Pacific Ocean, are both vast and rich in resources, and should be able to cooperate and benefit from trade. Therefore, when this Canadian Trade Delegation set out on its eastern tour last month, our government and business community immediately prepared to receive them sincerely. Now that all the members of the delegation arrived in Shanghai yesterday (16th), we should naturally express our warm welcome to strengthen the friendship between the two countries.</p>
<p>However, we also want to take this opportunity to express our hopes to Canadian business leaders. Trade between the two countries benefits both parties, but must be built on a foundation of equal treatment and goodwill. Last year, Canadian goods shipped to China reached US$23.5 million, while Chinese goods shipped to Canada were only worth US$3 million. Compared between the two countries, China had a trade deficit of over US$20 million. Its benefits to Canada are conceivable. This is because China's industries are not prosperous and its products are not abundant, so it can only feel ashamed. However, the Canadian government's suppression of Chinese goods and harsh treatment of Chinese immigrants are also factors. Leaving aside other matters, the Canadian government's ban on Asian immigration is already considered very unfair. In East Asia, China and Japan are of course both major powers. The Canadian government has negotiated a secret agreement with Japan, allowing 150 Japanese immigrants to enter each year, while strictly rejecting Chinese people. The harsh Article 43 of 1923 was specifically designed to oppress Chinese immigrants. Even the wives and children of Chinese immigrants are not allowed to enter Canada. Chinese immigrants returning to China must have a limited period. Import inspections are extremely harsh, and after entering the country, they are often suppressed by local governments. Despite their vows to fight to the death, Chinese immigrants have had no success. Our National Government and the business community are all familiar with these issues. Under such unequal treatment, seeking a balanced and mutually beneficial development of trade between the two countries is like climbing a tree to catch fish. Since the Canadian business leaders have come to China with the purpose of expanding trade in East Asia, they should first investigate the facts that hinder goodwill between China and Canada, and try to remove these obstacles, so that the practical benefits of trade can be achieved.</p>
<p>What the people of our Republic of China need is not that Chinese merchants or overseas Chinese have any special privileges in Canada, but only that overseas Chinese and other foreign people traveling in Canada, and Chinese goods and other foreign goods shipped to Canada, enjoy equal treatment. We deeply hope that the members of the Canadian Trade Delegation will make efforts in this regard after returning home from their tour of the East.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Situation of the Delegation's Arrival in Shanghai <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>▲ This trip is of a preparatory nature ▲ The official inspection delegation will come to China next year.</p>
<p>The Canadian Far East Trade Delegation arrived at the New Customs Wharf at 11:00 AM yesterday aboard the Empress of Japan. Representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Chen Shiguang and Liu Yunfang, representatives of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Shou Jingwei, and representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau welcomed the delegation at the wharf. After arriving in Shanghai, the delegation stayed at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund in Nanjing Road. The head of the delegation, Mr. Emery, and the secretary of the delegation, Mr. Clarke, met with our reporter yesterday and stated that the delegation inspected Japan for two weeks. This time, they came to China because they needed to rush back to their country to celebrate Christmas. Therefore, the time was very short. Moreover, this trip to China was of a preparatory nature, hoping to contact leading figures in Chinese politics and business in advance in preparation for sending an official inspection delegation to China next year to conduct a long-term study of trade conditions between the two countries. However, it is a great pity that this time they cannot stay in China for a few more days. It is now scheduled to leave Shanghai on Tuesday for Hong Kong, and then to Guangzhou, staying in Sanbu for a total of two weeks. There is no time to visit Nanjing and the North. This is our first time in Shanghai, and we feel that Shanghai is a very developed city, worthy of being the center of China's economy, finance, industry, and commerce. Shanghai's imports account for half of the country's total. Canada is also paying close attention to the Greater Shanghai Plan, which will make it a beautiful city and a center of culture and education. Shanghai goods were imported into Canada beginning in 1869, and Canadian goods were shipped to Shanghai beginning in 1871. Half of the people on the Pacific coast of Canada are of Chinese descent.</p>

<h3 id="e199">▲Reply from Delegation Leader John M. Imrie <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Delegation leader John M. Imrie gave a reply, saying, "I am deeply grateful for the hospitality extended to us this evening. I am honored to be the Vice-President of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce represents the chambers of commerce of 205 cities in Canada. I extend, on their behalf, congratulations to the Chinese government and people. Canada is only now beginning to understand the significance of China's political changes. In the past, we were confused by the various developments in China's politics and military due to a lack of understanding. Fortunately, we are now gradually understanding that these changes are not just phenomena of conflict and division, but rather precursors to major reforms and progress. China's achievements in recent decades could not be achieved in other countries in hundreds of years. China's current reforms, such as in education, society, politics, and industry, have taken our ancestors four centuries to achieve, while China has made astonishing progress in less than thirty years. This is largely due to China's experience, philosophy, and civilization of over five thousand years. This rich heritage has greatly contributed to its modern transformation. Compared to the long history of Chinese culture, the last thirty or fifty years are like a fleeting moment. This temporary transition will soon be forgotten and submerged in the greater political, economic, industrial, and social life of the future. We in Canada deeply appreciate China's historical civilization and philosophical contributions to the world. McGill University in Montreal, one of the most famous universities, has established a special department to study it. Mutual understanding between China and Canada is beneficial to both. The current Canadian trade mission has close ties to commercial and economic matters. Through personal contact, we can advance international understanding and goodwill, especially among the countries bordering the Pacific Ocean. Changes in economics and transportation are creating a new international community along the Pacific Ocean, and the center of world commerce is gradually shifting from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Old commercial practices are gradually being eliminated, and new commercial relationships are being established. This will affect not only one or two continents, but the entire world's commerce is in a vortex. Resources such as people, raw materials, sea routes, human needs, intelligence, and talent will inevitably concentrate in the Pacific, and China will play an important role in this Pacific international community because of its vast land, abundant resources, large population, long historical experience, and long-standing philosophical traditions. When China passes through its current period of transition, and its politics, finance, and commerce enter a period of stability, its transportation, trade, and commerce will greatly develop, becoming one of the world's great industrial and economic powers. It will join hands with its Pacific friends like brotherly nations to strive for a better position. Although Canada has a short history, it can also play an important role among its friendly nations because it came into contact with other countries on the Pacific relatively late and therefore has more suitable elements. Canada stretches four thousand miles from east to west. It has only been one hundred and forty years since white people traversed this continent and first discovered the direct access to the Pacific coast, and even sixty years ago, the population of western Canada was still less than one hundred thousand. Therefore, among the Pacific friendly nations, Canada has a simpler history and has never had misunderstandings or animosity with other countries, nor has it ever caused conflict or war. Canada has no political or economic ambitions towards its friendly nations other than maintaining peace and promoting mutually beneficial trade. Therefore, it is better suited to assist its older friends on the Pacific coast to jointly maintain peace in the Pacific and to seek ways to enhance it. Moreover, the Pacific friendly nations cannot form a closed community that does not engage in beneficial exchanges with the outside world. With today's rapid transportation and close trade relations, a world where remote places are like neighbors and the world is one family has been created. Canada can also make unique contributions to this larger scope of world peace because Canada is located in the middle of the Far East and the United Kingdom. It has had two hundred and fifty years of political and commercial relations with its mother country, and with China, the first voyage of the Canadian Shipping Company's ships across the Pacific was in 1888. Since then, the commercial exchanges and personal contacts between the two sides have become increasingly frequent. Therefore, Canada, contacting the United Kingdom across the Atlantic and China across the Pacific, has been doing so for many years. Can it not serve as a mediator between these two great countries, conveying the actual situation of one country to the other, in order to help maintain and promote understanding and goodwill between the two countries? Canada and the United States of America share a three-thousand-mile border. For over a hundred years, they have taken it upon themselves to convey the actual situation to each other between the United States and the United Kingdom. Can they not now take the position of conveying the truth between America and Asia? Moreover, Canada has a latent force in maintaining world peace. The people of Canada are based on the English and French ethnic groups. At the beginning of colonization, the people of the two countries lived separately. By 1760, Canada was entirely under British rule. The struggle between the two ethnic groups for leadership had been decided. Since then, they have been cooperating sincerely, trusting and working together, and both have contributed to the creation of a new national character. Therefore, Canada is not only adjacent to the Pacific friendly nations because it is located on the Pacific coast, and is politically linked to the United Kingdom, and is linked to the United States by close ties, but its ethnicity is also linked to the Latin ethnic groups of Europe."</p>

<h3 id="e202">Appeal from Overseas Chinese in Canada <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>—Telegram from Wu Ruoquan and others to representatives of the Shanghai Party, Government, Military, and Business Sectors—</p>
<p>▲Demanding Equal Treatment▲Appealing for National Assistance</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Canada, Wu Ruoquan and others, sent an express telegram saying: "To the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, Director Chen of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai, Mayor Zhang of Shanghai, and the directors of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce: The British Canadian Chamber of Commerce has initiated the organization of a Far East trade mission, which set off for China last month and will arrive in Shanghai in the coming days. However, our compatriots overseas have suffered from various harsh regulations imposed by their government in recent years, and their livelihoods are on the verge of collapse. Now that the trade mission is coming to China, we have heard that our authorities and business leaders are preparing to welcome them, but there is no avenue for the appeals of overseas Chinese in Canada. We should find ways to help them and save them. Wu Ruoquan and others have resided in Canada for many years and have witnessed the Canadian government's mistreatment of our overseas Chinese compatriots and its trade with China. The situation is extremely tragic. We will now present the facts as follows:</p>
<p>According to the Canadian government's 1929 trade report with China, Canadian goods imported into China were worth 27,007,997 yuan in national currency, while Chinese goods exported and sold in Canada were worth 4,497,796 yuan in national currency. This means that our country lost 22,510,201 yuan in national currency in trade with Canada in one year. In addition, with the losses from freight charges for Canadian ships carrying goods and passengers, the total loss to Canada in one year should be over 30 million yuan. How can we reverse this loss of over 30 million yuan each year? This is a major issue that urgently needs to be studied and addressed today. Imposing tariff policies and restricting the import of Canadian industrial products to protect the development of our domestic industries are all matters that our government should pay attention to. For example, our country's tea and silk are traditionally major export commodities, but there is a trend in Canada of using Japanese silk to replace Chinese silk and Indian tea to replace Chinese tea. Our country should improve its silk products to compete with Japan and improve its tea products to compete with India, so that Canadians will welcome our country's tea and silk, in order to increase the quantity of our tea and silk sold in Canada and thereby reverse the losses in trade with Canada. We should also imitate the example of Canadian merchants coming to China to conduct investigations and organize overseas trade missions to Canada to investigate their needs, with the aim of transporting various products other than tea and silk to Canada for sale. These are all matters that our merchants should pay attention to. The above are the key tasks that Wu Ruoquan and others sincerely hope that our government and business leaders will strive to develop in trade with Canada.</p>
<p>Alas, do the Canadians say that overseas Chinese are taking away their jobs and lowering their standard of living? Not only is Canada vast and sparsely populated, but it also needs to increase its population to develop its industries. In terms of reason, this does not match the facts. Is it that the Canadian government is only welcoming European immigrants? Recently, hundreds of thousands of European immigrants have entered Canada each year. How can they explain their welcoming one group while rejecting another? The reason why Canadians are discriminating against our overseas Chinese is not only an economic issue, but is also driven by racial prejudice. Can our government and our people bear to sit idly by as our overseas Chinese are heavily oppressed by the government and people of their place of residence without lending a helping hand? Can they accept the humiliation of foreigners treating us as an inferior race without thinking of ways to wash away this shame? The late Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that overseas Chinese are the mother of the revolution. Many of our overseas Chinese have devoted themselves to the improvement of domestic politics, economy, society, and education. Now, our overseas Chinese are in a struggle for survival, and they hope that our government and people will work together to alleviate their suffering, just as people in a severe drought hope for rain clouds. Now that the Canadian trade mission is coming to the East, it is a good opportunity for our government and people to lend a helping hand. We humbly request that government authorities and business leaders, when discussing matters with Canadian merchants, either warn them or explain the advantages and disadvantages, so that after they return to their country, they can include this in their report and urge their government to become aware and amend or cancel the various harsh regulations mentioned above, especially the amendment to the 1924 Immigration Act, which is the urgent need of overseas Chinese. For example, the requirement that overseas Chinese must return to Canada within two years of leaving should be changed to five years. Also, the requirement that merchants entering the country must have a capital of 2,500 gold yuan and are limited to engaging in import and export business should be changed to not adding any restrictions on the type of business they can engage in. Also, the restrictions on merchants' children entering the country should be removed. Also, the restriction that students must leave Canada immediately after graduation should be changed to allowing them to reside freely in Canada for practical experience. Moreover, there has been talk of establishing a Sino-Canadian commercial treaty in recent years. We especially hope that our diplomatic authorities will, at that time, adhere to the principles of equality and mutual benefit and stipulate clauses that allow overseas Chinese in Canada to enjoy the same treatment as overseas Chinese from other countries, in order to improve the situation of overseas Chinese. This is for the sake of the overseas Chinese themselves and for the sake of the national economy. This is what we overseas Chinese sincerely hope that our government and business leaders will do. The overseas Chinese are suffering and are in dire need of help. If our government authorities and business compatriots rise up to save them, not only will the overseas Chinese be grateful, but it will also be the good fortune of the nation. Overseas Chinese in Canada: Wu Ruoquan, Zeng Yangfu, Cheng Tianfang, Lai Lian, Huang Huabiao, Zhao Weiping, Li Mianchen, Guan Suren, Huang Zhongwen, Situ Langchuan, November 10, 1930.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since our country is an economically backward country, the deficit in our foreign trade relies on the wages and small profits earned by overseas Chinese residing in those countries to offset it. It is estimated that there are over 40,000 overseas Chinese residing in Canada. Assuming that each person, on average, earns 200 yuan in national currency each year after deducting expenses in Canada, the total amount remitted back to China would be over 8 million yuan in national currency. This amount is sufficient to compensate for part of the losses in trade with Canada. Our overseas Chinese drift to foreign lands for the sake of earning a living for themselves and for the sake of compensating for trade losses for the country. However, they suffer from the oppression of local governments and the rejection of the people. Their plight is unspeakable. We respectfully present this to our government authorities and business leaders in detail.</p>
<p>In recent years, anti-Chinese sentiment has permeated throughout Canada. The reasons they hold are: saving domestic workers from unemployment, maintaining high wage levels, maintaining a high standard of living, and saying that inferior Chinese cannot assimilate with them. They fabricate these inappropriate reasons and develop various harsh regulations to oppress our overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3 id="e203">(1) To Restrict Overseas Chinese from Entering the Country <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>In 1924, the Canadian government revised the Immigration Act, stipulating that all Chinese laborers are not allowed to enter the country. Merchants must have a capital of over 2,500 Canadian dollars and be solely engaged in import and export business before they are allowed to enter the country. These merchants can only enter the country alone and cannot bring their wives and daughters. Students must have the qualifications to enter university and must leave the country immediately after graduation and are not allowed to reside there. Moreover, when the Immigration Bureau implements this regulation, it interrogates those entering the country from the business and academic circles in various ways, making things difficult. If they are suspected of anything, they are rejected. Therefore, it is extremely difficult for those newly going to Canada to enter the country. The Immigration Department also registers those residing in Canada. A considerable number of people have been rejected and deported because their registration procedures are not complete. From now on, our overseas Chinese will disappear from Canada.</p>
<h3 id="e204">(2) To Exclude Chinese Laborers from Factories <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Factories employ Chinese laborers because they are hardworking and can work for long hours with extremely low wages. It is said that their treatment is already far different from that of Canadian workers. However, after the Canadian government promulgated the maximum working hours regulation, it also promulgated the minimum wage regulation. As a result, overseas Chinese have been excluded from factories one after another. Even those who remain have been forced by labor unions to dismiss them. Overseas Chinese have fallen into the misery of unemployment.</p>
<h3 id="e205">(3) To Prohibit Chinese Businesses from Employing White Women <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese in central Canada mostly run restaurants and employ white women as waitresses to attract customers and earn more profits. Canadian businessmen are very jealous of this. However, according to the principle of freedom of industry, they cannot prevent overseas Chinese from operating this business. The governments of the central provinces have therefore promulgated a regulation prohibiting Chinese restaurants from employing white women. They are restricting their business by this regulation. If this regulation is not removed, our small Chinese businessmen will not be able to survive.</p>
<h3 id="e206">(4) To Establish Separate Schools for Yellow and White Children <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>The government of British Columbia in western Canada considers the Chinese to be an inferior race and fears that Chinese children will hinder the progress of white children. Based on this reason, it has enacted regulations prohibiting Chinese children from attending white schools and establishing separate Chinese schools to accommodate Chinese children. This measure not only prevents our overseas Chinese children from receiving the same education as white children, but also insults our nation in its meaning.</p>
<p>The above four are only the major points. In addition, there are various harsh regulations such as agricultural restrictions and laundry restrictions, which are even more difficult to enumerate.</p>

<p>— Gao Wei</p>
<p>Edited by Lu Mengshu</p>
<p>Published by Wenhua Art and Book Company</p>
<p>What is film? What is film art? And what is film art supposed to express? In backward China, how many decent answers have there been to these questions? What is the state of the so-called domestic film industry? What do Chinese film audiences demand? What kind of films are needed in this era? Everything we see only evokes endless sorrow and sighing. People in the film business focus solely on making money, but what about film publications that have a guiding responsibility? They focus solely on "praising." It is truly rare to find anyone who makes a real contribution to Chinese film and Chinese film art.</p>
<p>Film is the eighth art among emerging arts, a comprehensive art that comes after literature, drama, music, dance, painting, architecture, and sculpture. We can say that film is a new art formed by the extreme development of modern human intelligence, successfully integrating various arts. Its field of development is based on three essential elements: industrial, scientific, and artistic. Without any one of them, it cannot succeed. In modern times, in all countries, it has almost occupied a great potential force. The general task it bears in the transportation of thought and in the determination of conceptual forms is becoming more and more active. It exposes the inherent national spirit and national characteristics of a nation and also promotes them. The presentation of national colors is indeed unusually clear and strong. But in reality, the importance attached to film by the general public is due to factual conditions. The incredible ability to control human behavior is cultivated through the various qualities, functions, and advantages of film. Thus, in quantity and substance, the hearts and emotions of the audience are easily lifted and engaged in unconscious appreciation. Because the expression of film is closest to the lifestyle of human beings, it directly fills the empty hearts of human beings, awakening and inspiring strong will, and forgetting all unfortunate defects from the fatigue of life. In the appreciation of the screen, one feels a new and bright force. Therefore, the formation of the universality of film has its own unique qualities.</p>
<p>But what is the situation of film when it is introduced to China? Film has only a very short history in China, but it has already flowed into a morbid and dangerously deformed development. On the surface, the Chinese people are indeed interested in film, but in essence, they still cannot shake off the old habits of the Chinese. They only see some superficial things and grasp some vague impressions. The so-called evaluation of Chinese films has nothing to say except to undermine the dignity of the national character. We simply cannot admit that those films are sufficient to represent our film industry. At the same time, it seems that there is a need to start all over again.</p>
<p>However, the reason why Chinese films have declined to this point may not be unrelated to the backwardness of Chinese literature and art, which has led to film also flowing into an unconscious state, failing to grasp the correct central idea for development. This is undeniable. Therefore, the biggest problem with Chinese films can be said to be the lack of true leaders of film art. As a result, it has been occupied by a group of shallow and boring people. Now, our literary and art circles have finally undergone a sudden and drastic change, advocating a nationalist literary and art movement that establishes the entire people as the central ideology. This will inevitably have a huge impact and form a new opportunity for film. The nationalist movement in literature and art has been generally recognized, and the national consciousness in film is also generally needed. We are just about to use the special qualities and functions of film to bear the current national mission. Similarly, in order to save the crisis of Chinese films, all those who work hard in film and are dissatisfied with the current situation of the Chinese film industry should gather in this category and jointly devote themselves to the nationalist film movement in order to fully reach the brilliant realm of Chinese films. Recently, in our film industry, the atmosphere in this regard seems to have attracted people's attention. We sincerely embrace unlimited prospects for the start of a new opportunity for Chinese films.</p>
<p>It was the "Film Magazine" that first discovered this movement and took on the responsibility of advocating it. Everyone who pays a little attention to Chinese films knows the reputation of Lu Mengshu, the editor of "Film," in the film industry. Mr. Lu deeply understands the objective and general task of film art and the trend of modern film art. Therefore, he resolutely erected the banner of the nationalist film movement. On the one hand, he followed the establishment of nationalism in literature and art, and on the other hand, he created new life by breaking through the huge crisis in the Chinese film industry. Mr. Lu's vision is truly worthy of our admiration and gratitude. Under this circumstance, we have seen the exposure of the theory of nationalist films in the previous issues one, two and three of "Film." Especially the third issue is even more distinct. But Mr. Lu still has greater ambitions, so he published the "Nationalist Film Movement Special Issue" in the fourth issue of "Film," seeking to further actively promote the power of this movement. This is a very gratifying thing for our future film</p>

<p>industry, and we cannot help but pray for it.</p>
<p>In "Our Words," we further recognize the attitude of this special issue:</p>
<p>…Although film is mistakenly regarded as one of the entertainment tools by shallow and boring people, its own artistic value and mission have not disappeared because of it. Its emergence was originally the same as literature and art, an artwork produced in the ideological form formed on the standpoint of the nation. For this reason, our colleagues also followed the nationalists in literature and art and made a national film movement, and published a special issue in this issue of this journal as the beginning of this movement...</p>
<p>We certainly dare not be complacent, and we dare not boast. We are both indignant at the boredom of those who make a living from film and feel the decline of literature and art.</p>
<p>In order to demand the improvement of the film industry, we also demand national self-determination. Therefore, we try our best to elaborate on the ideological center of film, and we strive to instill national consciousness in people.</p>
<p>We have raised the banner, we have shouted, we have moved forward, and we have done it. People, Chinese people, you are facing a great crisis. You must rise up and participate in our work.</p>
<p>What a bright and honest attitude!</p>
<p>In terms of content, most of the texts in this issue belong to theoretical construction. Originally, at the beginning of a movement, theory is indeed the most important. Based on the correct theoretical foundation, we can proceed step by step to promote it. Here, let's briefly talk about a few main articles.</p>
<p>Bao Luoduo's "China Needs Films with National Characteristics" fully explains the issue of national characteristics in film. The author believes that films in all countries have their own national characteristics expressed in them, because "the characteristics of each nation should be indicated one by one, and people in the world will not pay attention to them. For this reason, we have to come out to discuss our nationalism." As for what national characteristics Chinese films should express, the author tells us that "the national characteristics of China are in what place, which artists should search for. Successful works of art do not have the characteristics of each nation, especially modern works of art are like this," and there is also one thing, "the characteristics of each nation can be in the process of evolution from time to time, which means that we should be responsible for creating it."</p>
<p>Li Chunsen's "Construction of Nationalist Films" first explains the various special advantages and potential of film, and points out the permanent halls of the United States, England, Germany, France, Russia, Italy, and Japan, and proves that the power of film to dominate the audience in recent years is so great that it cannot be ignored. Second, it elaborates on the relationship between film and the nation, and the objective conditions of film in this era. In the current state of literature and art that establishes a national center of consciousness, it is urgent to incorporate nationalism into film, and "in order to further clearly establish national consciousness and hope for its full development, the construction of nationalist films is an important task today." Third, the author examines the qualities contained in foreign films, and judges them from a broad perspective, discovering their common points. On the one hand, there is a firm and clear national consciousness, and on the other hand, it expresses the characteristics of the nation to which it belongs, eliminates all ideas that hinder its own nation, and promotes the will of its own nation to develop upward, expressing all the struggling and tragic history of its own nation in the process of increasing its own glory. In order to make it clear, the author also said one by one the national characteristics expressed in the films of various countries. Secondly, the international nature of film is also worth noting. Generally, in the process of development, a nation must let people recognize the advantages of its own nation and occupy a position in international culture. Therefore, film has become a medium. However, in modern imperialist countries, they often like to describe the ugliness of different nations to intersperse and set off their own pride, and our Chinese nation is one of the unlucky ones. Fourth, looking back at our Chinese film industry, we found that it is full of decline. Not only is the past disappointing, but "in the current huge crisis, it is still in the ascendant. The film industry is still deeply infected with deep-rooted poison in the big drum, and does not know how to be self-conscious and self-help. They do not have the long-term vision to do realistic research, they do not have literary and artistic evaluation, so they are obviously close to being blind and standing, leaving the nation and humanity behind." Fifth, is the author's general conclusion, affirming that in the current era, only the nationalist film movement is the only way out for the Chinese film industry. As for the construction of the nationalist film base, it proposes several main outlines: 1. Organize a strong and large-scale film company. 2. Train actors. 3. Create scripts. 4. Organize a nationalist film magazine.</p>

<p>Qiu Yuan's "Nationality of Film," according to the editor, Qiu Yuan originally planned to write four or five thousand words, but unfortunately he couldn't think because of eye disease, so he reluctantly wrote this article. In the future, he will definitely write another article, so let's wait. The main purpose of this short article is that the author believes that the national color shown in the film is not only a fragment of the national color, but also the entire national spirit and national consciousness. As for the opinions of the film industry, he said, "Wait, let's first form our national consciousness about film, and then work hard to create our national film."</p>
<p>The editor himself said in the opening of "Nationalism and Chinese Film," "Film, a new artwork, is the only way out for nationalism, because it can not only give people a glimpse of the characteristics of a nation in history and personality, but also give people a glimpse of the manifestation of a national spirit in the development of personality. For this reason, we also have such an urgent need for Chinese and German films." The author also sought out the various reasons why we Chinese need nationalist films from many aspects. The author's paragraph is truly thorough.</p>
<p>Film is the newest and most powerful in literature and art. We can no longer make it deformed. We must now make it truly bear its own mission. We must now make it realize its own inherent center of consciousness—the true spirit of nationalism.</p>
<p>This true spirit of nationalism is the Western culture expressed in Western color TVs, and the love problem that is specially proposed in Western films for everyone to make a true solution, just like the masculine beauty and feminine beauty that are specially elaborated in Western films. In short, we must continue to work with the nationalism we are advocating. Gentlemen, gentlemen who make a living from film, please get up, please get up urgently, abandon the previous wrong ways, and establish the current nationalist film.</p>
<p>Tang Songgao's "China Should Have China's Emerging Films" clarifies the relationship between film and nationalism from the perspective of lifestyle, and also has unique insights on society, and is indeed a text worthy of attention. The author finally hopes, "The emergence of this new Chinese small national consciousness film art is the spiritual liberation of the weak Chinese nation."</p>
<p>In addition, there is Gao Jianhua's "Expression of the American National Spirit," which explains it with the United States as the object. Luo Baigao's "Rogue Emperor and French Nationality" uses the film Rogue Emperor to explain the state of the French nationality. Other texts are left for readers to understand by themselves.</p>
<p>The paintings in this issue are also very powerful, and most of them focus on the aspect of healthy beauty, so that our nation, which is known as the sick man, can feel something.</p>
<p>Looking at this "Film" as a whole, the contribution to our film industry is indeed not shallow. Although the text in this issue seems to be too biased towards one aspect of exploration, this kind of theoretical construction also plants the impression of basic concepts in general. I sincerely hope that "Film" will become the central publication of the nationalist film movement, and start from all aspects of theoretical script creation, film criticism, and create a youthful situation in the Chinese film industry.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that all colleagues in the Chinese film industry will quickly wake up and go to the road of the nationalist film movement, for our nation, for our films.</p>

<p>— Bin</p>
<p>The Department of Journalism at Fudan University held its first meeting at Yiyuan</p>
<p>The Department of Journalism at Fudan University has been running for less than three semesters, but it has achieved remarkable results and has long been praised by people in the community. Even in comparison with other departments in the school, it can be regarded as a wonderful flower that has emerged later. The biggest reason for this is still the cooperation between teachers and students. Director Xie's guidance is effective. We can also say that the achievements of the Department of Journalism today are by no means accidental. Moreover, the colleagues in the department are full of talents. Important positions in the school, such as the Fudan News Agency and the Five-Day Journal, are all organized by these excellent colleagues. The cooperation between teachers and students is also stronger than other departments, because Director Xie and Professor Huang Tianpeng love students as much as their own siblings and children. Therefore, Professor Huang, who is in charge of the "Newspaper Organization" course, actively plans to organize a small-scale newspaper so that students can gain experience and knowledge of running a newspaper. At the same time, they can also take this opportunity to practice and prepare for future application in major domestic newspapers. It is really rare to see such enthusiastic teaching among professors in other schools.</p>
<p>We are now studying, especially those who are studying journalism, it is not enough to concentrate on burying our heads in books. Regarding these subjects, we must go outside to find more abundant knowledge. Of course, we must often come into contact with society. In short, it is very important to work hard for knowledge outside the textbook. Director Xie had already seen this, and in the shortest period of time, he organized a weekly talk, the time is uncertain, and students in the Department of Journalism can participate at will, as long as it does not conflict with the regular class. On the one hand, it can connect the feelings between teachers and students, and on the other hand, it can get a lot of common sense in casual talks, breaking the dull and boring life of the classroom. This is much more meaningful.</p>
<p>This first weekly talk was held at Yiyuan, under the new guidance of Director Xie. More than a dozen students walked to the destination together. Really, there is another kind of fun. After entering Yiyuan, the spirit is refreshed, because the air here is fresh. The dull and boring classroom life every day really makes people feel tired. Director Xie and others found a small pavilion and gathered together to talk, and the joy was indescribable. It is not something that my unflowering pen can describe vividly.</p>
<p>Director Xie announced the purpose of setting up a weekly talk course and the importance of guiding the correct life outside the classroom. Secondly, he also talked about the need for journalists to have flexible minds and keen characteristics. When interviewing for news, it is very difficult to find out the true age of a woman. But we journalists have to use our flexible minds at this time. Director Xie said that when I was studying in Japan, a class of students was sent out to practice interviewing, and they were asked to find out the true age of a young lady. However, this young lady refused to tell them no matter what. One of the students cleverly used his flexible mind. He first asked the young lady how many years she had graduated from a higher girls' school, and how old she was when she graduated. Then he talked about other women's issues, etc., and she answered them very faithfully with great interest. Soon after, the student asked her how many years it had been since she graduated, and she quickly said it without forgetting anything. At this time, the student had already reached the goal of interviewing the young lady's true age, because the young lady's age, as long as you add the number of years she graduated from high school to the number of years she has left the school, it is equal to the current age. At that time, the students who were sitting there were enlightened by Director Xie's words.</p>
<p>At this point, Ms. Guo Zhenyi, a talented student from the department, came. She transferred here from Ginling Women's University, so she has a good grasp of academic knowledge. But Director Xie laughed and said that the secret of finding out the true age of a woman is not told to women. Everyone was delighted. However, I have now written down this method and told it to most readers, not only to make up for Ms. Guo's lack of knowledge.</p>
<p>I will not describe the scenery of Yiyuan. I think readers all know it.</p>
