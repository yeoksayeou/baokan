<p>He Jian Personally Commands; Hankou Military News: The Fourth Route Army is attacking the enemy from Western Hunan; He Jian is personally commanding, with plans to eliminate Zhang Gui's remaining forces within ten days. (Special Dispatch on the 12th) Hankou: He Yingqin Dispatches Jia Botao to Nanjing on the 11th to Report on Hunan Affairs to Chiang. (Special Dispatch on the 12th) Hankou: News from the Headquarters: (1) The main force of Zhang Gui's army is still in the vicinity of Liling,不敢前進 and dares not advance; (2) The enemy is confiscating firearms from local militias and police along the way, appointing Yan Renyi, Wang Zhendao, Li Zemin, and He Gan as division and brigade commanders. (Special Dispatch on the 12th) Nanjing: Zhang Muxian, Director of the Nanjing Office of the Fourth Route Army Headquarters, reports from Hankou: (1) Due to strategic considerations, our Fourth Route Army has completely joined forces with Chiang's and Cai's divisions, which have arrived in Hengyang, and the Central Army to encircle and suppress the rebel forces. It is expected that Zhang Gui's rebel army can be jointly expelled within about ten days; (2) According to a report from Changsha, Bai Chongxi was wounded in the left wrist in the battle of Tiehekou (i.e., western Liling) and is currently receiving treatment in a hospital; (3) The rebel enemy is currently gathering towards the Xiang River, exhibiting extreme panic and appearing to be fleeing towards Jiangxi; (4) The rebels have extorted 1.2 million from the Chamber of Commerce in Hunan.

Zhang Gui's incursion into Hunan was originally intended to lure the rebels deep in for the purpose of annihilation. Our army, in order to achieve a complete victory, has no choice but to temporarily retreat and await reinforcements for a joint suppression. If we were to block and attack the rebel forces alone, our forces would be insufficient and would be a useless sacrifice, merely devastating the homeland and potentially turning them into roaming bandits. We are currently mobilizing our troops to cooperate with friendly forces to achieve a complete encirclement. I am reporting this first to ease your concern, and I will await Muxian's arrival in Nanjing in the near future to report in person." (Special Dispatch on the 12th)</p>

<p>Yesterday Opened the Eighth Congress</p>
<p>Then Hold a Closing Ceremony Nanjing: Mongolia Congress Opened Eighth Congress at Afternoon, 12th, with 46 Representatives and 13 Observers. Wu Heling President. Report on Examination Results of the First Group Examination Committee: 1. Resolution on Land; 2. Resolution on Finance; 3. Resolution on Party Affairs (Contents have been reported). The above 3 cases have been voted. Wu Heling proposed that there are 7 remaining places for Japanese students at our country's expense. Intending to request the Ministry of Education to use these 7 places as Mongolian quota for studying in Japan. If these 7 places have been filled, please supplement them again when there are quota outputs. Until the Mongolian students reach 7. The name and method of Mongolian and Tibetan students studying abroad, which was decided by the Second Plenary Session, is still requested to be implemented in accordance with the plan. It was passed by the deliberation. The Mongolia Congress has ended here. The closing ceremony was held at 3 o'clock. After playing music and performing the ceremony, the chairman Ma Fuxiang issued a closing declaration, mainly saying that the resolutions of the conference are all based on a fair and objective attitude, and strive to meet actual needs, do not promote high opinions, do not adhere to established rules, and fully consider the special circumstances of Mongolia within the party’s doctrine, and give full consideration to the unanimous requirements of the Mongolian people. Efforts to embody the central government's doctrine and policy. The theory and facts both take into account the central and local opinions, and adopt a progressive approach as an improvement step. According to this plan, the Mongolia of the future will not be as weak as before. Moreover, Mongolia is located in the main point of invasion by the two great imperialist countries, and the environment is dangerous. It is difficult to survive by following the old ways. Only by working together, uniting with all ethnic groups in the country, and jointly participating in the national revolution led by the Chinese Kuomintang can we achieve a bright future. The central government should also support the education, economy, transportation, and industry in spirit and material. Next, the representative of the Central Party Department delivered a brief speech, saying that when the Mongolian nation was extremely strong, its power once reached Moscow. It occupied an important position in East Asian history. Later, it was oppressed by the Qing Dynasty and invaded by imperialism, not only lagging behind in culture, but also in a very dangerous situation. Now, Mongolian compatriots are fighting for freedom and equality in the Three Principles of the People together with the national nation. In a narrow sense, it is to seek liberation for Mongolia. In a broad sense, it is to seek happiness for the entire nation and to win glory for the country. The representative of the National Government, Tan Yankai, delivered a brief speech, saying that the successful results of the meeting were gratifying. The only hope for the future is to not only implement the resolutions, but also expand the propaganda after returning to Mongolia, so that all people can understand the party's key points of national construction and the government's sincerity in seeking happiness for Mongolian and Tibetan compatriots. The business that Mongolia urgently needs to develop now is education and transportation. I hope that we will work together and strive for progress in accordance with certain procedures. Next, Gesang Zeren delivered a speech, and then there was a photo opportunity, and the meeting ended. (12th Day Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e21">Rumors of Japanese Minister of Army Ugaki's Resignation <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The dismissal of the Japanese Military Ordinance Minister Kato has already caused a major dispute. Although the Minister of Finance and the Navy Minister are still calm, the Privy Council has expressed dissatisfaction with their actions, and the House of Peers has also paid serious attention to them. Therefore, the extent to which the Navy Minister's position will shake in the future, whether the military officials will no longer resist, and how the tide of disharmony in the naval community will evolve are still unknown. It is said that Minister of Army Ugaki General has also expressed his determination to resign. The resignation of the Minister of Army is due to dissatisfaction with the military budget, which is another matter, but the reason for this is the same as that of Military Ordinance Minister Kato, who is fighting for the national defense plan. According to the Japanese telegram, the opposition faction has used the resignation of Minister of Army Ugaki as a reason to launch a cabinet overthrow movement. If this is realized, the Japanese political situation can be said to be eventful. Political parties in various countries are either centered on warlords or on the economy. Japanese political parties represent the bourgeoisie, so their political储 can also be called economy-centered. However, the Japanese economy is currently in a difficult situation, and the bourgeoisie is also in constant panic. The general public is blaming the government authorities for being unable to provide relief. As far as the army and navy are concerned, the so-called warlords still have labor to be done. Now, if they want to take care of the warlords and increase military spending for national defense, they will lose the sympathy of the public. If they want to take care of the economy and temporarily postpone national defense and reduce military spending, they will not be able to quell the anger of the army and navy. This is indeed a dilemma for the Japanese government. Although countries today have this kind of dilemma, the government's ability is not seen in peaceful days. When do you want to test the government's ability? Is it at this time when it is in a dilemma? Domestic Important Telegrams Two</p>

<p>Harbin: The Soviet Russian authorities in northern Manchuria are recently quite worried about the anti-government movements of the laborers and farmers in various parts of the coastal provinces, which have been reported repeatedly. The Consul General of Harbin, Morinegov, has asked the Chinese authorities to ban the White Russian newspapers and Chinese newspapers in northern Manchuria from reporting false information. According to the talk of those who have recently returned from Vladivostok, the recent situation in that area is roughly as follows: (1) Anti-government movement: It is reported that the Kulodkov railway along the Ussuri Railway line, which was recently occupied by the White Russian 巴尔齐萨, is still unobstructed and is no different from usual. However, the situation near the斯齐亚 coal mine and乌哥利拉亚 is more tense than usual. (2) Shortage of Materials in Vladivostok: There is a general shortage of goods, especially food. White bread is not available except for Communist Party members, and even black bread is difficult to buy. However, the residents do not have unstable actions. The market is peaceful. Although it is said that personal business is absolutely prohibited, it is not entirely true. Chinese and other personal stores still exist, but the official management is strict and commerce is declining. (3) Vladivostok's Docks: The Port of Vladivostok was originally the port for exporting products from northern Manchuria and was able to compete with Dalian. Its facilities are gradually improving. Recently, there have been very few shipments of goods to Vladivostok, so foreign ships do not enter the port. The port is extremely desolate. There are currently about 2,000 Chinese and Russian laborers at the docks. Once the transportation of goods develops, the 1,000 or 2,000 laborers will not be enough.

<h3 id="e40">Brewing a Movement to Overthrow the Cabinet <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>War Minister Ugaki intends to resign.谷口氏當前之難關</p>
<p>Taniguchi's Current Predicament. The Rengo News Agency, Tokyo, 12th. The anti-government faction is dissatisfied with War Minister Ugaki's handling of the current government's austerity policies and the issue of supreme command authority. They intend to use the War Minister's resignation as a cause to launch a movement to overthrow the cabinet. Furthermore, the faction of Hiranuma Kiichiro, Vice-President of the Privy Council, is also continuing a fairly strong anti-government movement. The government side reports all important cabinet matters to War Minister Ugaki each time, making great efforts to appease him. However, it is highly questionable whether they can reverse the War Minister's intention to resign. The Rengo News Agency, Tokyo, 12th. Since re-entering the Army Medical Hospital on May 17th, War Minister Ugaki's condition has not improved, and his wound remains as before. His secretary is still handling his affairs and turning away visitors. However, military affairs such as military system reform, budget issues, and periodic army personnel changes have not been clearly handled. The investigation documents are also piling up. The army's demands and opinions have not been thoroughly communicated to the government, and it is not a long-term solution to have civilian officials managing affairs, and there are many inconveniences. Therefore, it is planned to take advantage of the fact that the preparations for the foundation of military and political reform have made some progress and retreat to a position of respect for talent. It is said that Vice-Minister of War Affairs is currently visiting Korea to visit the commander of the Korean Army, General Minami, or that he will immediately engage in negotiations to become the successor to the War Minister. A part of the Rengo News Agency believes that War Minister Ugaki's resignation will definitely be realized. The Rengo News Agency, Tokyo, 12th. It is said that General Kato is resigning as Chief of the Naval General Staff, and General Taniguchi Naosane, who will assume the position of Chief of the Naval General Staff, will arrive in Tokyo tomorrow and immediately begin compiling a supplementary national defense plan. However, since this matter was the cause of Chief Kato's resignation, it is expected that he will inevitably fall into a dilemma. If he is concerned about financial resources and reduces the plan, then the issue of troop strength will undoubtedly be criticized by the military councilors' meeting to be held soon. From the perspective of General Taniguchi's personality, this matter will inevitably cause a great deal of conflict. General Taniguchi said to people at the Kure Naval Base yesterday that he intends to conduct a detailed study after taking office as to whether he can bear responsibility for national defense within the scope stipulated by the London Treaty. I am only ordered to take office and do not want to get caught up in the vortex, but I will do my best to fulfill my duty as a soldier. General Kato Kanji, who resigned, said to people that he was unable to fulfill his responsibility to assist at the time of the return training and dispatch due to his lack of strength. He is afraid that he is inadequate. At this time of many crises, he will only do his best as a military councilor. In addition, Finance Minister Kaya said that the world has both praise and criticism for my measures, but the truth of the matter will naturally be clear after a considerable period of time. However, it is regrettable that this incident has resulted in the replacement of the important position of Chief of the Naval General Staff. I cannot speak about my own advancement or retreat. The Rengo News Agency, Seoul, 12th. In response to the resignation of Naval Chief of Staff Kato, there is also talk of Finance Minister Kaya resigning. Governor-General Saito of Korea said regarding this matter that although there is talk of Minister Kaya resigning, as far as I know, Kaya has absolutely no reason to resign. This is just a rumor, and I believe that there is no need to further expand the issue of supreme command authority in determining troop strength.</p>

The German government has protested to the Soviet government for interfering in German internal affairs through Communist propaganda. Negotiations are currently underway between the two sides, but people in political circles expect that a break will inevitably occur soon. At that time, the only option is to still propose arbitration under the conditions of German-Soviet friendship.</p>

<p>Negotiating with leaders of various parties, still maintaining a friendly policy towards France. The National News Agency, Bucharest, 11th. Today, the new Romanian King continued to negotiate with leaders of various parties to form a cabinet of talented individuals, but the hope is slim. It is expected that the result will ultimately be that former Prime Minister Maniu will form a new cabinet based on the National Peasant Party, or will add a few unattached individuals. The National News Agency, Paris, 11th. The Paris morning paper reported on its reporter's audience with the Romanian Prince, saying that the Prince first expressed his deepest gratitude for the preferential treatment he received from the French people and government during his exile in France. Then, he described in detail the welcome of the Romanian people and parliament, and the scene of visiting his father's tomb, unable to contain his joy and tears. He then recounted the scene of his and his young son appearing on the balcony of the palace, with the people welcoming and celebrating, saying that all of this left an indelible impression on his soul. He was also deeply grateful for the advice and assistance of his brother, Prince Nicholas, in helping him ascend the throne. Regarding political issues, the Romanian foreign policy has always been based on friendship with France, and will continue to follow the old path. At home, he will first reorganize finances, develop resources, and seek economic recovery. The National News Agency, Moscow, 11th. Russia is still paying close attention to the accession of former Romanian Crown Prince Carol, calling it a coup instigated by France. The government newspaper stated that if French imperialists could make the deposition of Carol a condition for obtaining Poland's entry into the war against Russia, then they might as well depose him. It also said that it has received confirmation that the French General Staff had demanded guarantees from Carol for the right to build several railways in Romania. These railways are all of strategic importance, so they facilitate Romanian-Polish transportation and consolidate the anti-Russian front. It also said that Romania must pay a considerable price to obtain the happiness of establishing a new monarch in his prime, but it is doubtful whether this kind of joy can become true happiness. Reuters, Bucharest, 11th. Romanian King Carol has been in contact with the leaders of various parties all day to form a mixed cabinet, but since it has not been successful, it is expected that the Romanian King will invite former Prime Minister Miron Cristea to reorganize the cabinet based on the National Peasant Party, and add a small number of detached politicians, including Bishop Martha.</p>

He also said that the Civil Secretary's use of the Administrative Gazette for the use of Prime Minister Strickland to publish various libelous articles about the church is regrettable.</p>

<p>Shipping serum from Paris to Cairo. Generous assistance from all sides. Achieved delivery in a surprisingly short time. The Rengo News Agency, Alexandria. A man named Youriquetz in Cairo has a four-year-old son suffering from infantile paralysis, and his condition is hopeless. The doctor told him that the disease could be cured by injecting a serum for infantile paralysis created by Dr. Bouguet in France within a week of the onset of the disease. Upon hearing this, Yu Li Quezi immediately telegraphed Paris and entrusted him to use all means to send the serum to Egypt in the shortest possible time. The fastest way to do this was to take the British Imperial Airways passenger and cargo plane between London and Alexandria. Therefore, Paris immediately used a plane to transport the serum to Vienna, Austria. It happened that the British Airways plane had already departed. The Paris plane knew that it could not delay any longer, so it immediately opened full speed to catch up and chased straight to Budapest before catching up with the British plane. When the serum was handed over, Quatz had already been waiting in Alexandria, just in time for the morning when his beloved son had been ill for a week. He received the serum from the plane, but the fast train to Cairo, which only runs once a day, had already left Alexandria a few minutes ago. If it was delayed until the next day to reach Cairo, his beloved son's life would be unsalvageable. For this reason, Quatz was anxious and crazy. Fortunately, he received the sympathy of the airline police and the railway officials, who came up with a shortcut. They ordered the fast train to make a temporary stop at Sidi Gaber station, five miles away, and sent a powerful plane to carry Quatz and the serum at full speed to catch up. The police officers also called the police officers at the station to prepare a car from the airport to the station and to clear the traffic. As a result, Quatz was able to board the fast train safely. A father's love actually defeated the disease demon with speed and saved his beloved son's life, becoming a beautiful story.</p>

<p>The 78-story New York building has just been completed, and construction of a 105-story building is about to begin. The Rengo News Agency, New York. The Chrysler Building, which is 30 feet taller than the Eiffel Tower in Paris and has 78 stories, 1,030 feet high, was completed and opened on May 27. For a time, all of New York's skyscrapers were overshadowed by it. But now, an even taller 105-story building is about to appear on Manhattan Island, taking its place as the tallest. The construction plans for each floor have not yet been completed, so the height has not yet been determined. The person planning to build this high-rise building is Louis Atura. The buildings on the island are currently only five to twelve stories. One million gold dollars has already been invested to purchase 30,000 square feet of land to build this high-rise building. The old buildings will soon be demolished and construction will begin in 1932. It is expected that the first 60 floors will be built in the ordinary architectural style, and from there upwards, it will be built in a tower style.</p>

<h3 id="e52">British Unemployment Increases <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Imports exceed exports in May. Reuters, London, 12th. In May, British imports exceeded exports by £5 million compared to the same month last year, and the number of unemployed people also increased by 5,000 last week, totaling 1,775,000 people. The newspapers are paying attention to these facts, and the fact that German steel mills have reduced wages by 7% is also alarming to Britain. However, the economic situation in Germany is not better than before. This can be seen from the report of the Reuters correspondent in Berlin. According to his estimates, the total number of unemployed people in Germany is 2,637,000, an increase of 1,250,000 people compared to the same month last year. The German newspaper Vorwärts strongly opposes the reduction in wages at steel mills and expects that a serious labor movement will soon break out in Germany.</p>

The Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry also issued a statement opposing the Labor Union Law. However, the Social Democratic Party plans to hold joint speeches to counter the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which intends to reject it.</p>

<p>Economizing on expenditures is an appropriate measure. The Rengo News Agency, Tokyo, 12th. The voices of criticism from the Seiyukai and others against the government's budget economy are loud. A reporter from the Telegraph went to ask Finance Minister Inoue for his opinion. The Finance Minister said that no one but God can predict the extent to which prices will fall now. Since the fall in prices is a real problem, it is a matter of course to economize on budget expenditures. The current budget is based on estimates based on the high prices of the past. If it is not changed, it will inevitably lead to abuse. Adding economies is the duty of the government. If prices fall again, the government will economize again and again. However, this is not strange, and the Seiyukai has attacked the government's natural measures. If the Seiyukai has other brilliant ideas, I hope that it will quickly show them in concrete cases. The Seiyukai also said that the government violated the constitution. In fact, I believe that the measures taken by the government are extremely appropriate and appropriate.</p>

<p>Believed to be insulting to Indians. The National News Agency, Bombay, 11th. Members of the Indian intellectual class are ridiculing the Simon Inquiry Report, while the general uneducated people are naturally unable to read and judge it. Nationalist newspapers said that some points are even more regressive than the Chelmsford Plan, which is considered inapplicable. The Bombay News reported that the report was insulting to Indians and quoted the report's statement that the biggest drawback in India's people is the social and economic system inherited from ancient times, but this can only be eliminated by the Indians themselves. The commentary said (There is now a new Solomon (the most holy and wise monarch of ancient Jews) coming to judge, but this Solomon, even though he is extremely wise, still insists on not giving the Indians the power to eliminate evils and create their own destiny.) In addition, the right of India and Burma to be separated is also extremely resented by Indians, so even the most peaceful liberal newspapers oppose the report. Even the officials in India who hold the views of British India are also against the report for being too radical in spirit. The National News Agency, New York, 11th. The New York Times and the World Report have favorable comments on the report of the Simon Commission on Indian affairs and said that it seems premature for Indians to criticize the report at this time.

<h3 id="e61">European Federation Issue <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>(Special Paris dispatch) The internal affairs of the European Federation, which is being rumored around the world, must attract the attention of the world. Now, a summary is given below. On May 17, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs ordered French representatives abroad to send a memorandum on the issue of organizing the European Federation to the governments of 26 European countries. The motivation for organizing the European Federation has been brewing for a long time. Politicians and writers have repeatedly advocated this view. The reason why it is particularly noteworthy this time is that the French government has officially proposed it. On September 9 of last year, taking advantage of the annual meeting of the International Federation, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Briand, invited representatives from various European benevolent societies to a luncheon. During the banquet, he delivered a speech expressing his intention to launch the organization of the European Federation. At that time, the representatives all expressed their deep sympathy and requested the French government to conduct a concrete study of the matter and distribute the results to the various governments so that they could jointly plan the implementation. The memorandum sent out by the French government this time was in response to the request of the representatives in September. May 17 was the day when the International Payments Bank officially assumed the management of Germany's war reparations debts. The post-war affairs of the European War came to an end from then on. The French Minister of Foreign Affairs specially chose this day to send out the memorandum on organizing the Federation in order to commemorate it. The organization of the European Federation is to adapt to the current situation in Europe. The French Minister of Foreign Affairs stated in the memorandum that the economic situation in Europe has not yet reached the stage of cooperation. From a political, economic, and social perspective, there is a danger that peace in Europe will be difficult to maintain. European countries have this permanent organization to promote the responsibility of the same place. The study of this issue is therefore aimed at saving the situation. European countries have this permanent organization to promote local security and the well-being of the people. It also stated that this kind of organization does not seek theoretical perfection, but first seeks to adapt to the needs of the current situation. The relationship between the European Federation and the International Federation is an important issue. Therefore, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs solemnly declared in the memorandum that it is not to create another organization of European countries outside of the International Alliance, but under the jurisdiction of the International Federation, in accordance with the spirit of the International Federation, to reconcile the interests of the European countries. The realization of the European Federation is a contribution to the International Federation, and countries outside of Europe can also benefit from it. There are several issues that European countries feel need to be resolved more directly and quickly. European countries can resolve them at the Federation Conference because of their geographic and racial relationships. It can also assist the International Federation in resolving purely European issues. This is one of the functions of the organization. The European Federation has no right to replace the responsibilities and powers stipulated in the International Federation Covenant, such as mediating disputes. This mechanism can assist the International Federation in handling everything and promote a perfect environment so that the International Federation can implement resolutions to maintain peace. In short, the organization of the European Federation should be within the scope of the International Federation, and the members of the Federation are limited to the European member states of the International Federation. The French Minister of Foreign Affairs also stated in the memorandum that the European Federation has absolutely no intention of resisting any group or country. Sometimes it is necessary to ask countries outside the Federation to assist. The European Federation first issued a general agreement with very simple content, which only stipulates the principles of cooperation among European countries. Based on experience, this agreement will be changed into a more detailed treaty in the future. As for the organizational aspect, the European Federation has regular meetings, with the Political Committee and the Secretariat as the executive bodies. All agencies are centered in Geneva. In terms of handling affairs, the French government advocates that the economy should be dominated by politics, that is, all countries, regardless of the degree of economic development, are in principle in an equal position within the Federation. The full text of the memorandum is printed in about fourteen pages. The governments of various countries should reply to the French government with their opinions on this memorandum before July 15. The attitudes of the various countries are still unknown. The positions of the various countries are different, and their views are naturally different, but it can be asserted that there will be no fundamental opposition. (Sent by Ji Mai on May 18) It should be noted that the content of the memorandum described in this article differs in detail from the reports transmitted by Reuters and other agencies, so it is kept in the important news.</p>

<p>The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at 2:00 PM on the 12th in the Second Conference Hall of the Central Party Headquarters. More than twenty reporters from various newspapers attended. Zhang Tingxiu chaired the meeting and introduced Central Committee Member Miao Peicheng, who reported on the situation of Party affairs in the North and the general public's understanding of the current war. Miao's report mainly stated that since March 20th, Party headquarters in Beiping, Tianjin, Chahar, Suiyuan, Hebei, and Shanxi had been destroyed by reactionary forces. Although they were superficially affected, actual work continued. Since the Party headquarters in the North were occupied by reactionary forces, different factions had been disputing and attacking each other for months without any results, and the situation had reached a stalemate. Reactionaries in the North still hoped that Wang Jingwei would come north, but based on general observation, even if Wang went north, there would be no way to resolve the disturbances. The people in the North believed that Yan and Feng's reckless actions this time were meaningless and only disrupted social order. Therefore, they resisted Yan and Feng's tax increases. Even the lower-level officers and soldiers under Yan and Feng felt that this war was absurd. Even the propaganda personnel did not understand the reasons for this war. Therefore, based on these observations, the North has a widespread understanding of right and wrong. Feng and Yan's regressive actions were even worse than those of the warlords, so their failure was very rapid. The meeting adjourned after the report.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Battles Occur Near Fuzhou <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>At the same time, a fire broke out in the city. A Fuzhou correspondent reports that Liu He and Ding Luxingbang's divisions have reinforced their defenses outside the northwest of the provincial capital since the 7th, contact has been made. The situation at the front and rear is described separately below. On the morning of the 5th, Liu's division learned that Lu's division had sent Chen Rongbiao's regiment to station at Xiaobeiling in the northwest center (30 li from the provincial capital), approaching the defense area of Jiang Yan's regiment of the division's Lingtou Township. A military conference was immediately convened, and it was resolved to send a telegram to Lu Xingbang requesting him to quickly withdraw the regiment to its original defense to avoid misunderstandings. By the morning of the 7th, no reply had been received. Chen's regiment continued to advance, and the two sides' outposts began contact at 11:00 AM. By 10:00 PM, the fighting gradually intensified, and the battle line gradually expanded. The northern route extended from the right side of Xiaobeiling to Ma'anshan, 10 li from the North Gate, and the western route extended from the left side of Xiaobeiling to Jinjishan, 10 li from the West Gate. Both sides occupied the mountain peaks and fired at each other with machine guns and mortars. The sound of gunfire was extremely dense in the city. At 8:00 AM on the 8th, Liu's division used heavy artillery to attack Lu's division. Lu's division retreated to Beiling on the northern route (40 li from the provincial capital). Liu's division occupied Ma'an and Jinji mountains, and the Huangdian arsenal was also recovered. The fighting subsided slightly. At 10:00 PM on the 8th, Lu's division sent reinforcements of about one regiment to attack Ma'an, returning from Beiling over Lingtou at night. Liu's division also returned fire with artillery. The sound of cannons continued all night. Looking into the distance from high ground, smoke and fire could be seen rising from the mountain peaks. At 8:00 AM on the 9th, Liu's division used a charge formation to force Lu's troops back to the Meiting and Baofu mountains on the western route (about 15 li from the provincial capital). The two armies were still fiercely fighting on the Western front but the sound of artillery fire was no longer heard in the city. The combat troops on both sides were Chen Rongbiao's regiment on the northern route and Qian Yuguang's regiment on the western route. The reserve team was Wang Tianrui's regiment, totaling about 6,000 people. The commander was Yu Bailiang, chief of staff of the division headquarters. The command post was located in Xiangzhe in the western countryside. Liu's division's Northern front regiment was Jiang Yan's regiment, the western regiment was Yan Ximin's regiment. The reserve team was Tang Lin's regiment, also with 6,000 soldiers. The commander was Brigade Commander Liu Shangzhi, and the command post was located in West Lake Park. On the 8th, Liu's division also transferred Chen Wantai's entire brigade from Quanzhou to the provincial capital, which will rotate with Liu Shangzhi and Gui Zhenyuan's brigades to the front line for combat. Furthermore, the division announced that as a result of the three days of combat on the 7th, 8th, and 9th, Lu's troops suffered more than 200 casualties and more than 500 were captured. One battalion commander was captured, and more than 20 machine guns and mortars and more than 400 rifles were seized. After the fighting broke out in Fuzhou City on the 7th, the initial situation was quite stable. Later, due to nightfall, a group of hooligans specialized in setting fires everywhere in an attempt to disrupt the rear. At about 7:00 PM, Dongmen Street and Qixunkou near the 56th Division Headquarters successively caught fire, each burning down more than ten houses. Fortunately, residents in other places discovered and immediately extinguished the fires. At the same time, all the city's electric lights went out, and the situation suddenly became tense. Shops closed one after another, and pedestrians were extremely scarce. Military and police agencies immediately dispatched teams to patrol, and fire brigades from various shops also summoned rescue workers, divided up fire-fighting equipment, and conducted patrols. On the 8th, it was discovered that some unscrupulous elements were carrying short guns and hand grenades, taking the opportunity to make trouble. Each street and alley has now set up barricades and organized joint defenses for self-protection. The Provincial Defense Command also issued a notice stating that any patrol officers or police who captured these troublemakers would be executed on the spot to serve as a warning. However, shops have been closed since the 7th, and the exchange rate for small silver coins has risen from 72 to 80 wen per coin. The price of white rice has risen from 12 yuan to 16 yuan per shi. Many wealthy families in the city have moved to the South Bank naval defense area in Taiwan to live. (June 9th)</p>

Hankou Correspondence: At 3:00 PM on the 10th, at the intersection of Paris Street and Dituomei Consulate Street in the French Concession, a Japanese Navy cargo truck without license plates, driven recklessly by Japanese sailor Nakaoshigei Masaaki, ran over Yang Ruiwen, a sergeant and orderly in the office of the Chief of Staff of the Commander-in-Chief's Traveling Headquarters, killing him instantly with a fractured skull and brains splattered out. The situation was extremely tragic. The Traveling Headquarters sent Secretary Wu Qi to negotiate with the Hankou Local Court, which dispatched Prosecutor Liao Yuan to the scene for inspection. The details of this case are described as follows: Incident Circumstances: At 2:20 PM, Sergeant Yang Ruiwen, an orderly in the office of the Chief of Staff of the Traveling Headquarters, was riding his bicycle on official business to the French Concession. He was traveling north on Paris Street and wanted to turn onto Simin Street. As he was about to turn, a Japanese Navy cargo truck without license plates was speeding east on Simin Street, wanting to turn onto Paris Street. Yang was unable to avoid it and was knocked down by the truck at the intersection of Paris Street and Dituomei Consulate Street, shattering his skull and brains. He died instantly. The French military police on duty at the scene only took the driver, Japanese Nakaoshigei Masaaki, to the French police station, while the truck was allowed to escape. Culprit's Confession: After being taken to the police station by the French patrol police, the Japanese sailor Nakaoshigei Masaaki was interrogated by the French police authorities at 3:20 PM. According to his confession, an Annamese patrol police officer in the street at the time had directed him to stop, but it was too late to prevent running over Yang Ruiwen. Yang Ruiwen, the deceased, was 19 years old and from Bengbu. The bicycle number was 923, which has also been verified. Note on Inspection: After receiving the report, Wang Jue, Chief Prosecutor of the Local Court, dispatched the duty prosecutor Liao Yuan, clerk Yan Xun, inspector Cheng Zhidao, and four French police officers to the scene for inspection. Inspector Cheng examined the body and found a total of four injuries: (1) The skull was broken into five pieces, and the brains were completely splattered out. (2) Scratches on the right shoulder. (3) Scratches on the right arm.</p>

<p>(4) Blood in the mouth and nose. The head injury was confirmed to be fatal. After the inspection, a letter was sent to the French police station requesting the extradition of the culprit to be tried according to the law. The victim's body was prepared with a coffin by the adjutant's office of the Traveling Headquarters for burial. Negotiation Process: After receiving the report, the Chief of Staff's Traveling Headquarters sent a letter to the French police station requesting that the culprit, the Japanese, be handed over to our country's court for handling. At the same time, Secretary Wu Qi and Adjutant Lai Shousong were sent to negotiate. French Consul Bostede refused to hand over the culprit, claiming that he had no authority to handle Japanese Navy personnel. After repeated negotiations by Wu and others, they argued that the Chinese government should send a letter to the Japanese Consul requesting extradition, and the French police station should not release the culprit freely. Finally, Japanese Consul Kokone came to the French police station and negotiated three times. As a result, the culprit confessed that he was a current Japanese naval seaman named Nakaoshigei Masaaki. The Japanese Consul temporarily took him away, promising to hand him over at any time if the Chinese court requested an interrogation. The French Consul also took responsibility for handing over the culprit at any time for court summons. (June 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">The Beginning and End of the Shantou Strike <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Report from the Provincial Government Inspector on the Mediation Process. Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, Shantou merchants went on strike to protest the surcharge on electricity bills for military expenses. The truth of the matter was largely unknown outside. At the time, political circles accused the merchants of disrupting finances by resisting taxes, while the merchants believed that the surcharge on electricity bills was a temporary miscellaneous tax that merchants and residents could not bear for long. Moreover, the surcharge had already been submitted to the government for cancellation, but the municipal authorities were still collecting it as before, which seemed to disregard the law. The two sides went to extremes, and on the 21st of last month, police officers clashed with the accountant of the Jiacheng Silver Store when collecting the surcharge. The accountant was detained in the police station, and all the merchants and residents of the city unanimously went on strike in protest. The situation has been briefly described in previous reports. Later, Huang Zungeng, the inspector sent by the provincial government to the Chao-Shan area, mediated between the two parties. As a result, the municipal government canceled the surcharge, and if municipal expenses were insufficient, methods would be found to raise funds from the local area. The strike ended. In order to make the truth clear to readers, we have sought and recorded Huang Zungeng's report to the provincial government on the beginning and end of the case as follows: (It has been found that the surcharge on electricity in Shantou was levied in the 15th year of the Republic of China when the revolutionary army swore to launch the Northern Expedition. Due to the lack of military funds, a 10% surcharge was levied on all electricity in the city, which was intended to be used as temporary military expenses for the Northern Expedition. Later, Mayor Xiao Guanying submitted a request to the Guangdong Finance Department, which approved the allocation of the funds to municipal expenses. The burden on the citizens was endless. Various commercial groups petitioned the city's General Chamber of Commerce and the Commercial and Civil Coordination Association to submit a request to the government for cancellation. The government approved the cancellation in consideration of the merchants' difficulties. When Mayor Xu Xiqing stated that the electricity surcharge funds had already been included in the annual budget by previous mayors and that cancellation would be difficult, he requested approval to withdraw the cancellation order and maintain the original plan for continued collection in order to support municipal administration. The government approved the request for continued implementation. Recently, the National Government issued an order that all surcharges levied for military purposes should be canceled. The merchants and residents believed that the electricity surcharge in Shantou was a type of temporary military expense for the Northern Expedition and should be included in the list of cancellations. They repeatedly requested the municipal government to cancel it, but the municipal government refused, citing the city treasury's deficit. The surcharge was originally collected by the Electricity Bureau. Later, the merchants and residents negotiated with the Electricity Bureau to reduce the price and established an Electricity Price Reduction Committee to deal with the situation. Later, the municipal government saw this situation and took back the self-management. The merchants and residents believed that electricity was a daily necessity for the people and that electricity fees could not be used as a tax standard for permanent expenses. They again requested the municipal government to allow them to cancel it, but were still not approved. The merchants and residents had a case to rely on for the cancellation and were bound to achieve the purpose of cancellation. The situation was already turbulent and imminent. As a result, on the 21st of this month, police officers from the First Police Station clashed with the accountant of the Jiacheng Silver Store when collecting the electricity surcharge. The station charged him with obstructing official duties and sent police officers to arrest and punish the accountant, Fang Changda. Thus, the electricity surcharge turmoil that had been brewing for months broke out from here. When this happened, I was in Chao investigating a case. When I returned to Shantou on the afternoon of the 22nd, I inquired from all parties to find out the truth of the turmoil. At this military period, if the turmoil were to expand, I was sincerely afraid of affecting the security of the rear. Therefore, I and Supervisor Yang Jianping tried our best to mediate and inquire about the intentions of both parties. On the side of the municipal government, if the electricity surcharge was donated to the municipal government's expenses, it could be canceled at any time. On the side of the merchants and residents, if the municipal government's expenses were not as insufficient as the number of finances were public, and the monthly expenses were really insufficient, they would naturally find ways to make up for it. I believe that the key to resolving this case lies in whether or not the political expenses have been settled, and whether or not the turmoil can be quelled lies in whether or not the surcharges can be canceled. However, in this fiery scene, we should first start with canceling the surcharges, and then move on to planning how to make up for the political expenses after the surcharges are canceled. Therefore, on this day, the merchants and residents put forward three requirements and set a compromise method. I and Supervisor Yang were responsible for signing our names as the basis for resolving this case. However, it is easy to cancel the surcharges, but difficult to make up for the political expenses. Whether this case can be completely resolved depends on how to make up for the political expenses after the surcharges are canceled. I think that the merchants and residents intend to predict that the municipal treasury will have surpluses and no deficits, while the municipal government's monthly income and expenditure are not sufficient. It seems that the municipal government might as well make the monthly income and expenditure public so that the people can understand the content of income and expenditure, which is in line with the principle of financial transparency and also demonstrates the rules of official-civil cooperation, so that the municipal treasury has no deficit and the municipal administration has the hope of progress, which would be very good. However, financial transparency cannot be based on empty talk. There should be concrete measures so that merchants and residents can have the opportunity to participate. Now, merchants and residents are requesting the National Government to establish a Shantou Municipal Financial Management Committee, referring to the example of establishing financial management bureaus in various counties. Before the government approves the establishment, it is better for the mayor to clearly and honestly express official-civil cooperation, convene representatives of the Chamber of Commerce to the government to jointly discuss the monthly income and expenditure. On the merchants' and residents' side, the surcharges have been canceled and the income and expenditure situation has been clarified, so they will naturally be happy to raise funds. In this way, the electricity surcharge turmoil, which has lasted for months and almost plunged Shantou into a dangerous situation, can also be brought to an end. All the details of the electricity surcharge turmoil in Shantou and the mediation process between me and Supervisor Yang are hereby reported to your government for review. (June 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Suqian's Hanxu is Captured by Bandits <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The County Police Force is Weak and Dare Not Advance. Xuzhou Correspondence: Banditry has recently been rampant in the southern part of Suqian. The bandit leader is Liu Rongduo, nicknamed Liu Ershui, who was captured by the county last month and escaped. He has gathered followers and joined forces with the bandit leader Wei San. On the 2nd, they broke through Hanxu, 20 li south of Suqian City. Hanxu is located between the east and west roads, with two fortified villages that are doing well in business and are a prosperous area in the south of the city. The fortified villages are large in the south and small in the north, and their strength is also strong in the south and weak in the north. The southern fortified village has 50 quick-firing guns and is usually heavily guarded, forming a strategic alliance with Yexu and Yangxu. This time, it was captured because bandits first sneaked into the fortified village. Taking advantage of the morning when farmers were busy, they fired guns inside the fortified village, and the bandits outside responded. After Hanxu's southern fortified village was captured, the northern fortified village could not be defended either. The disaster victims there fled south to the Buzi Collection and north to the city to seek safety. After looting Hanxu, the bandits occupied it and forced all the villages, large and small, in the vicinity, such as Zhao Qunqiang and Qin Qunqiang, to evacuate. It is estimated that the area within seven or eight li nearby is a bandit zone. When the county government heard the news, it sent a police brigade to join forces with the militia to suppress them, but due to their weakness, they failed to attack. The fortified villages near Hanxu have also set up defenses to protect themselves. The people are learning the Small Sword Society to protect themselves. Even though the wheat is ripe in the fields, they dare not leave the fortified villages to harvest it. The police team in the city has stepped up its defenses. The Suqian County Party Department urgently telegraphed the Zheng Committee to request that measures be taken to suppress the bandits. The telegram stated: "Bandits are rampant in the southern part of the county. We have repeatedly telegraphed the province to request that measures be taken to suppress them. In the winter, a group of bandits attacked and captured Hanxu and other important towns in the south of Suqian, burning, killing, and looting everything. Refugees have been fleeing to the city to petition, and there are several cases every day. The county team and militia are weak. We are again requesting the provincial government to quickly send heavy troops to suppress the bandits to ensure the safety of the people. Otherwise, we will have no choice but to ask to be dismissed from our posts to apologize to the people of Suqian." (10th)</p>
<h3 id="e68">Problems Arise with the Reorganization of the Anhui Provincial Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The second session of the Anhui Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation Congress has been open for five days and has held four formal meetings. The convocation of this congress to reorganize in accordance with the new Chamber of Commerce Law is also an important issue, as the ministry order stipulates that all chambers of commerce must be reorganized and established before August 15th, otherwise they will lose their qualifications. The congress was originally scheduled to hold elections on the 8th and had already telegraphed the Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government to send personnel to supervise the elections. However, yesterday, it received a reply from the Provincial Party Department stating that since the county and town chambers of commerce under the Federation had not been organized according to the new law, the Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation could not proceed with the elections immediately and should stop the process. The Provincial Government's reply has not yet been received, so yesterday's election congress was not held and continued to discuss proposals as usual. However, the representatives from various counties must complete the reorganization procedures because they came to Wuhu from afar and are currently planning to proceed. The resolutions passed at the third and fourth congresses are recorded below: Third Congress: 1. The Xiang'an Chamber of Commerce proposed the establishment of a post office in Xiang'an.

The resolution was to send a letter to the Financial Commissioner's Office ordering them to collect taxes in accordance with the regulations and not to extort extra fees. 10. The Xihe Chamber of Commerce proposed the cancellation of likin cards. The resolution was to request the Financial Commissioner's Office to order the immediate cancellation. 11.

The resolution was to submit separate requests to the National Government, the Ministry of Finance, and the Anhui Provincial Government, striving for the abolition based on the treaty. Before the regular customs is abolished, the name of the supervisor must be restored, and it must not be quickly controlled by the Customs Service by foreigners. B, requested the cancellation of Yao Fang's proposal to the Anhui Provincial Government to establish a public wharf in Anqing, allowing foreign ships to dock and lose navigation rights. The resolution was to submit separate requests to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Communications, and the Provincial Government to immediately cancel Li Fang's proposal and severely punish the proposer.

<h3 id="e69">Su Bingwen Talks About the Situation in Manchuria <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Today, Su Bingwen, commander of the Chinese Eastern Railway Defense Army in Harbin, came from Hailar. I interviewed him at the Madier Hotel. According to Su, the Russian military border commander has recently been replaced. Bulkhairyu (i.e., Galen) has been transferred back to Moscow. The main part of the Russian army is located at the Da Wuli headquarters. A small number of troops are stationed at Abahaitu on the Sino-Russian border. The sound of artillery fire can be heard from time to time, which is probably from Russian soldiers practicing. I will take the time to meet with the Russian commander in Da Wuli after my mission in Harbin is completed, because there are many things to be negotiated on the border between the two sides. The 15th Brigade and the 17th Brigade have now been replenished to full strength. Each brigade still has three regiments. One regiment of the 17th Brigade is stationed in Fularji on the Harbin-Manzhouli Line, assisting in guarding the railway. One regiment of the 15th Brigade Infantry and one regiment of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade are stationed in Manzhouli. One regiment of the 15th Brigade Infantry is stationed in the Hinggan Mountains and Hailar. The troops of the 1st Brigade Infantry are stationed from Boketu to Duiaqingshan. In addition, because Russian bandits appear from time to time on the western front, two regiments of troops are dispatched from the 2nd Cavalry Brigade to fill in, with one regiment responsible for suppressing the bandits. In Yakshi and Sanhe Town, White Russians are searched. The White Russians, numbering about one hundred and several tens, are led by Zhai Kuofu, who is pretending to be Seminof to restore the Russian Empire and is calling for the occupation of the Sanhe area and the expansion of the organization. After the 2nd Cavalry Brigade suppressed them, they have been defeated. Zhai Kuofu and his remnants, numbering about thirty or forty, have fled to the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, but these dying embers will soon be completely eliminated. A part of Mongolia is cunning and had previously planned to take advantage of the Russian turmoil to seize control of Hailar's political power. Because the Sino-Russian incident was resolved quickly, these people's plans were not realized. Recently, Inner Mongolian nobles held a joint celebration. I have tried my best to contact their princes and others and have strongly warned the Han people not to enslave the Mongolians, so the relationship between the Han and Mongolians is very harmonious. Commerce in Manzhouli is difficult to restore at the border for a while. Hailar is actively restoring to its original state, which is expected to be not far away. (June 7th) Local correspondence</p>

<p>Four People Released in Shenxiang Kidnapping Case: Bandits from the Tianmashan Area of Songjiang County. On the afternoon of the fourth, over forty bandits came to Shenxiang Town to guard the town's outskirts, wantonly searching and looting. Before leaving, they kidnapped Wu Xianglin, Liu Shouzhi, Liu Qitao, Ye Sansheng, and Cheng Musheng, a total of five people. They forced them onto the bandit ship, taking the loot and escaping. Afterwards, the losses from the kidnapping were tallied at two thousand yuan. The county government issued an order to arrest the bandits. It is now known that all the kidnapped individuals except Wu Xianglin have been released. They were confined to the bandit ship for two days and nights, with their eyes blindfolded during the day. The release point was approximately near Fengjing. Currently, the bandit side is demanding seven thousand yuan from Wu's family as ransom, instructing Liu and the others to notify their families to quickly prepare and negotiate. However, Wu Xianglin's family is not wealthy, and the family is at a loss upon hearing this.</p>
<p>Construction Bureau Seeks Labor to Demolish the Moon City: Since the First District Office in the county town began vigorously demolishing Gao Bridge, traffic has greatly improved. However, since the four city moon cities have not yet been demolished, vehicular traffic seems unable to fully pass through. Now, upon receiving an order from the provincial office, the demolition of the moon city has been approved. The Construction Bureau has prepared drawings and plans to announce and seek labor to undertake the project. Bidding is scheduled for the twentieth of this month.</p>
<p>Case of Using Old Stamps Discovered: The Jiaxing Post Office discovered that a letter from this region's Provincial Middle School, signed by Xu Ziyun, contained a method for repeatedly using old stamps. The method involved fully coating the stamp surface with paste. Although the post office had stamped it, the recipient could peel it off, soak it in hot water for a few minutes, and the stamp would fade along with the paste, allowing it to be reused. The Heju Bureau immediately reported this to the General Post Office. Yesterday, the Shanghai General Post Office sent personnel to Songjiang to meet with the Songjiang Local Post Office Director Duan to visit County Magistrate Jin and inquire at the Provincial Middle School. It is said that a student used an alias. This case will be resolved by the Shanghai General Post Office. The student has not been found since leaving the school.</p>
<p>Xu Dingpei, a First-Year Student at the County Middle School, Runs Away: Xu Dingpei of Qibao, a first-year student at the County Middle School, recently took leave after class and went out. Another teacher spotted him and criticized him for leaving the school gate without permission, marking him down with a major demerit. Upon returning to school, the student explained to the teacher that he had previously requested leave from another teacher, protesting the demerit. For some reason, another major demerit was added. The next day, the student secretly left the school and disappeared without a trace. When asked, his family also said he had not returned. Therefore, there is much speculation about the student's whereabouts. He is still nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>Four Robbers Executed by Firing Squad: On the evening of February 5th of the seventeenth year of the Republic, the No. 6 patrol boat of the 6th Platoon of the 2nd District of the Water Police stationed in the Nanshuangmiao area of the county was suddenly robbed by fourteen bandits wielding guns. Two Mauser rifles and one signal flag were looted. Subsequently, the bandits robbed two businesses in the town, Xue Lixing Rice Store and Yuanfeng Grocery Store. Last year, they also robbed the Youjiatan in Sizhang and the Xiyang Bridge area. Afterwards, police detectives successively apprehended the bandits involved in the case: Yuan Asan, Wu Xirong, Liu Fuyuan, and Wang Hongbao. They were escorted to the county for interrogation, where they all confessed to the robberies. Unexpectedly, on the night of March 26th of this year, the two criminals, Yuan Asan and Wu Xirong, colluded with five other inmates, including Li Chengguo, to break out of jail. On May 9th, Wu Zhengrong, the Chief of Political Police of the County Government, re-arrested Yuan and Wu in Shanghai and sent them back to the county for confinement. Yesterday (the twelfth), the county government received a provincial telegram instructing them to execute the four robbers, including Yuan.

Yesterday, he secretly transported them to Wuxi by car. He got off the car at the Nanqi Station outside the South Gate. Li immediately instructed his henchmen to carry them, hoping to take them back to his home. Unexpectedly, three or four hooligans found out and immediately followed them. When they reached the railway bridge, they immediately stepped forward and robbed the seven pieces of red pills and fled. Afterwards, Li Guangde knew that they were prohibited items and could only remain silent and regret his actions.</p>
<p>Tragic Accident of a Child Hit by a Train: Yesterday at around 10:00 AM, a train running on the Chang-Hu line heading downwards passed the Yangqi area west of this county's station when a Jiangbei boy, about seven or eight years old, suddenly placed a stone on the track, intending to play a game. Unexpectedly, as he was placing the stone, the train suddenly arrived, and the child was unable to dodge in time, resulting in him being hit in the head by the locomotive. He bled profusely, collapsed in extreme pain, and lost consciousness. The porters at the station spotted this, carried the child to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. It is reported that his injuries are quite serious, and there is concern for his life.</p>
<p>Resolution of Labor-Management Dispute in the Sock Industry: The labor and management sides of the sock industry in Xiyi had a dispute over the revision of the agreement, which had been unresolved for a long time. County Magistrate Sun Zuji specifically convened representatives from both sides of the sock industry, including Wen Zichen and Zhu Fuming, at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss and mediate a resolution.

<p>Faculty and Staff Meeting Discusses the 19th Fiscal Year Budget: The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education has stipulated that the standard for local education funding budgets for the 19th fiscal year should not exceed 350 yuan per grade per school year for elementary schools and 700 yuan per grade per school year for high schools. Compared with the current education and economic standards in Jiangdu, the budget for each school and grade will be reduced by almost one-third, and the number of faculty and staff will also be reduced by two-fifths. Therefore, faculty and staff at all levels are paying close attention to this matter. If the budget is allocated according to this standard, the monthly income of faculty and staff will not even be comparable to that of the first and second years of the Republic of China, let alone the fact that the cost of living today is ten times that of twenty years ago. This amount is really difficult to maintain. During this time, Director Chen of the Education Bureau has repeatedly requested the county to increase the budget appropriately when he went to the provincial capital to participate in the directors' meeting, so as to avoid being too far from the past facts. The department replied that all directors should follow the department's orders and should not express the impossibility of the situation in advance. Currently, faculty and staff at all schools believe that this matter is of utmost importance. Today (the eleventh), faculty and staff at all levels of each school were summoned to the Public Lecture Hall in Mǎshén Temple to hold an emergency meeting to discuss this matter.</p>

<p>The Lijin Bureau Detains Foreign Rice Causing Disputes: Rice merchant Xi Zhuquan specially went to Wu to purchase 200 bags of foreign rice to transport to Hefei to supply the city because the rice price in Hefei was very high. He completed the price at Dongwai, but the Lijin Bureau said that it had not been inspected at the Sanchahe Sub-card and that all of it should be confiscated. After the Rice Industry Association, the Drought Relief Association, and the County Chamber of Commerce mediated ineffectively, it aroused public indignation.

<p>Dear Sir/Madam, We have received a letter from the Honolulu Chinese Chamber of Commerce dated May 9, which states: "We read in the Shanghai Shenbao that your commission has temporarily suspended its fundraising and relief efforts due to the unstable political situation. Please confirm if this is true." Our commission has been doing its best to provide relief to the famine in the Northwest, and has spared no effort in providing relief to the provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu. Over the past two years, we have allocated 600,000 yuan to Shaanxi and over 370,000 yuan to Gansu. As for the relief grain transported, even for Shaanxi Province alone, it has reached over 2,200 tons. As for Gansu, due to transportation inconveniences, the amount of grain purchased and distributed locally is not counted. As for the Chinese and Western relief workers sent out, there have been 22 in Shaanxi, including Gao Houru and Li Liangbi, and 4 in Gansu, including An Xianling and Gao Jincheng. Currently, Mr. Baker, the relief director of our commission, is personally stationed in Shaanxi, actively supervising the distribution of emergency relief, hoping to get through the difficult time of the spring famine and then continue to carry out work relief as a permanent solution. Because Shaanxi and Gansu have been suffering from famine for years and the people are not living well, our commission has been doing its best to raise funds and has never stopped. We have always admired your newspaper's wide circulation at home and abroad, and it is enough to influence public opinion. Therefore, we are stating the facts about our commission's recent two years of relief work in Shaanxi and Gansu. If you could disclose this information in your newspaper to show the facts, it would be a favor not only to our commission. China International Famine Relief Commission, June 5, 1930</p>

<p>In order to actively promote phonetic symbols, the Ministry of Education invited Wu Zhihui to give a lecture at the Ministry of Education at 2:00 PM on the eleventh. All members of the Ministry of Education and guests, including Yang Xingfo of the Academia Sinica, attended. Minister Jiang gave a speech introducing Wu Zhihui. Wu Zhihui's lecture said that the promotion of phonetic symbols should not be seen as difficult. The intellectual class should first learn and teach, and then actively promote them. Then many people can quickly spread the ordinary teachings and promote them easily. Now, let's start with unifying the pronunciation. Add phonetic symbols next to the initial elementary Mandarin textbooks and teach them seriously. If students fail the national phonetic alphabet exam, they will not be allowed to graduate (the speech was very long, and the Ministry of Education Secretary Fang organized it). After the lecture at 3:30, the Ministry of Education invited Wu to be the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Promotion Committee (Phonetic Symbols). He then took the opportunity to hold a discussion meeting to discuss ways to promote phonetic symbols. The meeting adjourned in the evening.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education has recently approved the registration of China Public School and its College of Law and Political Science in Shanghai. However, upon review, China Public School is an independent college in nature, and is equivalent to an independent college in terms of the academic system. It should receive the same treatment as an independent college. Therefore, the school's original College of Arts and Sciences should be renamed the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Social Sciences should be renamed the College of Law and Commerce, and the College of Pre-Medical Studies should be renamed the Affiliated High School.</p>

<p>Disguised Winning of the Championship. Kobe Dispatch: The Kobe Chinese Sports Friendship Association in Japan was founded by the young merchant Mr. Wang Chongshan and his comrades for many years. Its achievements are well-known, and its basketball team is especially famous. This spring, the team also participated in the Hangzhou National Games and became famous at home and abroad. The association spares no effort in promoting sports and encouraging young overseas Chinese. The 4th Hanshin Overseas Chinese Basketball Tournament was held on June 8th at 10:00 AM at the basketball court of Tongwen School. No less than a thousand people stood around the playground to watch the games. The cheers and applause from the student cheering squad were extremely magnificent, which is a rare sight in recent times. The results of this competition are listed below: Preliminary Round: Tongwen Team A won against the Art Team 35 to 23. Yueyue Team won against Tongwen Team B 52 to 30. Semifinals: Red Team won against Yueyue Team 34 to 19. Tongwen Team A won against the China Public School 83 to 27. The championship final was between Tongwen Team A and the Red Team, which started at 4:15 PM. The Red Team was the champion of the fall tournament last year, but unfortunately, one or two players were scattered, and their strength was greatly reduced. On the other hand, Tongwen Team A was a mixed team of teachers, friends, and students, and also included Zhu Zusheng, a strong player in the Far East volleyball team. This new force strengthened their power even more. Therefore, when the silver whistle blew, the two teams were seen competing for the ball. After a while, the Red Team cleverly passed and dribbled the ball to the right corner, and Bao Minan threw it in to score the first point. Then, Tongwen used rapid connections and infinitely changing tactics. Zhu Zusheng worked hard and Su Naichun made accurate shots to score points, causing the Red Team to be at a loss. They only returned one penalty shot for three points. In the first half, Tongwen took the lead with 23 points to 7. After the lemon time, the two teams returned to the court to compete. Tongwen added points step by step, and then sent the entire student team onto the court. The connection between offense and defense was even more satisfactory. However, the Red Team's Jiao Qingyun's long-range shots were amazing, and he made every shot. However, the strength difference was too great, and Tongwen Team A eventually won the championship with 46 points to 19. Last night's women's basketball game</p>

<p>Twenty-one to nine.</p>
<p>Guangdong First Women's Normal School and Liangjiang basketball teams met at the China Basketball Room last night at 7:00 PM. After a fierce battle, Liangjiang finally won with a score of 21 to 9. Referee: Lu Zhong'en. Last night's game was so intense that there was not a single cheer. The attacks were fierce, and the shots were made at the same time. The Guangdong army has always been known for its bravery, and Liangjiang is also a brave general. When the two heroes met, they did not give way to each other. Guangdong's Li Cuiying fouled Shao Jinjing. Shao Jinjing raised her hand and made a free throw to open the scoring record. Then, Shao Jinjing scored another goal, and Li Cuiying was again judged to have fouled. Shao Jinjing took another free throw and scored again. Liangjiang suddenly took the lead with 4 to 0. The Guangdong army launched a fierce counterattack, and Wu Xiuxian scored two consecutive goals, quickly tying the score at 4 to 4. The atmosphere suddenly became very tense. The stalemate continued, and it was difficult to determine the winner. Xi Jun made a backhand shot and scored a goal. In the first half, Liangjiang won against Guangdong with 6 to 4. Guangdong's Si Cong 　 Unfortunately, he had to rest from the second quarter due to stomach pain, and the military situation was greatly reduced. Liangjiang launched a large-scale attack, attacking endlessly. Xi Jun and Shao Jinjing scored points one after another. Although the Guangdong army's defenders tried their best to resist and made frequent adjustments, it did not help the overall situation. At the end of the first half, Liangjiang won against Guangdong with 15 to 4. In the second half, the fighting between the two armies gradually weakened, and the situation was more harmonious, and fewer points were scored. The result was 21 to 9, and Liangjiang won. Looking at the overall game yesterday, Liangjiang's basketball skills can be said to have greatly improved. The coordination between the forwards and defenders was quite flexible. The Guangdong army was naturally not weak, but unfortunately, they encountered a strong team. Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School players serve as technical intruders.

<p>Has practical methods that can be used as a model for various schools. Zhongwai News Agency said that our country's athletes suffered a disastrous defeat in this Far East Games. Although there is more than one reason for this, it is difficult to deny that the backwardness of technology is a difficult matter. The National Jinan University in West Shanghai has always been known in society for its expertise in sports. After suffering this setback, the athletes who returned did not feel discouraged. They believed that there was no way to improve in technology without applying scientific methods. The school authorities believed that many of the students in the school were descendants of overseas Chinese, and their physical qualities were generally excellent. The youth with excellent physical qualities were also excellent materials. Teaching students according to their aptitude is a good opportunity and place to create sports talents. The relationship between the Far East and the country's reputation is the responsibility of every man, and there is no room for complacency. The school has already formulated a great plan to implement vigorously. The investigation is recorded as follows: (1) Hiring Germans to guide and asking Mr. Buqi, the German coach of Northeast University, to be responsible for introducing a German with high technical skills, solid theoretical knowledge, and rich teaching experience to guide the school. The school is willing to make compromises and save money in other aspects, and it will not hesitate to spend a lot of money to recruit this person. (2) Establish a sports department in order to concentrate talents, train them, and create excellent sports teachers for foreign countries. Whether the establishment of the department belongs to the Education College or is directly under the Sports Committee is still being considered. The preparation period is one year, and it is decided to open it in the summer of next year. Its characteristics lie in the use of new methods, with equal emphasis on academic and technical subjects, to correct the theoretical and technical weaknesses of other university sports departments. (3) Funding for overseas students, selecting graduates with excellent grades and good sports skills to send to Europe and the United States to study sports. After completing their studies, they must return to the school to serve for at least three years. During the service period, they will be given a reasonable salary and labor. It must be of an obligatory nature, and special chapters will be formulated separately. (4) Construction of the sports area. The school's sports area was planned long ago, but the progress was delayed due to funding issues. Since the 19th year, the school affairs meeting has decided to treat the sports fees as special accounting and not mix them with regular expenses. Now the school has allocated special funds to rush the construction of the fitness room, Tai Chi room, and swimming pool in the area, and to install a broadcast radio station, which will broadcast the sports results to the outside world at any time, so that the people of the country have instructions and warnings. (5) Conduct compulsory sports. The school does not ask for special and general standards. It now stipulates that each college must hold a sports meeting for teachers and students once each semester, and each person must participate in at least one item. Even those without a special skill must join the health competition invented by Mr. Chu Minyi. In short, the school's striving for strength and ambition is nothing more than to awaken the people of the country and lead the people of the country through sports. I hope that the people of the whole country will rise up and catch up with this spirit. Why is it difficult to wash away the shame? Please look at the Far East four years later. Who will win the championship?</p>

<p>Abolition of Lijin Committee</p>
<h3 id="e101">Soliciting Post-Abolition Measures <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The National Abolition of Lijin Conference called by the Ministry of Finance, which is mostly sponsored by consumption tax and business tax, has not yet been officially convened, but the preparatory meeting has been held several times under the chairmanship of Counselor Li. The purpose of the Ministry of Finance in calling this meeting is to plan for post-abolition measures, that is, what methods will be used to offset the national treasury income after the lijin is abolished. Therefore, opinions are currently being solicited for post-abolition measures. In recent days, many provincial financial officials and experts have proposed concrete methods, mostly advocating the implementation of special business consumption tax, business tax, income tax, and other taxes. According to some people's consideration, income tax is difficult to audit and the procedures are cumbersome, so it is temporarily inconvenient to implement. However, consumption tax and business tax will definitely become a reality in the future.</p>

<p>Jianghai Customs has previously received an order from the Ministry of Finance to investigate and prohibit the export of copper to Japan, which has been officially announced and strictly enforced. However, villains only know how to seek profit and disregard laws and regulations. In recent days, there have still been private smuggling attempts, especially in large quantities of copper coins. Therefore, starting from today, capable customs officers will be assigned to board all foreign ships sailing from Shanghai to Nagasaki to conduct strict investigations. In addition, the Chinese Consul in Nagasaki will pay close attention to the investigation. It is also reported that Japan has recently requested China to stop the shipment of copper coins. It is heard that the Nagasaki authorities have already discovered the secret shipment of Chinese copper into the country. The Japanese authorities have contacted the Chinese Consul in Nagasaki and asked us to formally issue an order prohibiting the shipment of copper to Japan.</p>

<p>There is a rumor that the Gold Exchange will temporarily close down due to the gold surge. However, Mr. Wei Gongsong, an employee of the exchange, told others that the reason for the gold surge and silver cheapness has been seen in the major newspapers in Shanghai. As for the temporary suspension here, it is not accurate. However, since the occurrence of this trend, the exchange has held several meetings to discuss rescue measures. At the same time, the chairman of the board, Mr. Xu Busun, has repeatedly consulted with Minister Song and Minister Kong on the measures. However, the exchange believes that there is a temporary need for the outside world to make such determination. If it can save the overall situation, the exchange is also happy to temporarily suspend. After all, the power to manipulate this matter lies in foreign banks. The exchange has always been a free market, and its price fluctuations must be sought from foreign exchange rates.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Survey of Rice Crop Stem Borer Damage in Various Districts <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>A Reduction of 151,900 Piculs; Total Losses Exceeding 910,000 Yuan. In recent years, stem borer damage has been severe, causing losses to rice crops. According to a survey by the Entomology Bureaus of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces, Jiangsu suffered losses of 10,000 yuan in 1929, Zhejiang suffered losses of 40,000 yuan, and Jiangxi suffered a total loss of 190,000 yuan in 1928 and 1929. The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has ordered municipal commissioners in various districts to select five locations in each area and dig up ten rice roots per location, for a total of fifty roots, to be sent to the bureau for inspection and investigation. The results of the survey show that among a total of 3,299 rice roots, 716 contained stem borers, with a damage rate of 21.7%. The number of rice roots without stem borers was 2,583, accounting for approximately 78.3%. The area of rice paddies in Shanghai is estimated to be 140,000 mu, based on 2/10 of the total area. Assuming a yield of five piculs per mu, the annual rice production would originally be 700,000 piculs. Assuming a damage rate of 21.7% due to stem borers, the reduction in yield would be 151,900 piculs. Assuming the lowest price of six yuan per picul, the total loss would reach over 910,000 yuan. According to the table below, the areas with the highest degree of damage are Yangsi, Jiangwan, Gaohang, Pusong, Yinhang, and Caojing, followed by Zhenru, Gaoqiao, Lihang, Wusong, Tangqiao, and Pengpu. The highest damage rate is 44%, and the lowest is 10%. The table below shows the comparison of stem borer damage levels in various districts of Shanghai in 1929:</p>

<h3 id="e111">County Magistrate Urges Land Registration <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government previously received instructions from the Department of Finance to conduct land registration, which was forwarded to the Finance Bureau for implementation. However, since the commencement of the process on February 10th of this year, only a small number of people in various districts have complied. The main reason is that many of the land deeds held by the public are old unregistered deeds, and they fear being fined. Therefore, they are all waiting and watching. County Magistrate Yan believes that land registration is designed to protect the property rights of the people and should be actively applied for. It is unreasonable to remain uninformed. With the deadline set by the Department of Finance in June approaching, the registration should be completed as soon as possible. Therefore, in addition to submitting the matter to the county administrative meeting for deliberation, he specially instructed the district chiefs yesterday to expedite the process and not delay further, and to report on the progress of compliance for verification.</p>

<p>Bei Jietai, the director of the Baoshan County Finance Bureau, has found that the amount of arrears in grain tax in the county is very large. With the province and department urging payment, and the local government in urgent need of funds, it is imperative to collect the arrears. Therefore, at 2 p.m. yesterday, he summoned the tax collection officials from the five districts of the county and instructed them to collect the old arrears of busy season grain and unpaid mu tax from the 1927 and 1928 years, requiring all grain handlers to clear them all within half a month. For the 1929 busy season grain, it is even more important to inform all households in arrears to go to the counter to clear them as soon as possible. For those who are stubborn, they are allowed to report the worst cases for detention and forced payment. All old arrears of busy season grain from 1927 that have been incorporated into the urban area should also be strictly pursued. A notice has been issued to urge payment, and the original tax collection officials have been instructed to be responsible for the pursuit of the arrears for disbursement. Furthermore, the Baoshan County Finance Bureau and the Eighth District Party Department of Wusong jointly issued a notice yesterday to clarify the misunderstanding regarding the exemption of the 1927 busy season grain tax.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Exchange Bureau Cracks Down on Illegal Transactions <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>A Conversation with a Certain Official of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The Guowen News Agency reports that the yarn and cloth exchange posted a notice yesterday, which stated: “The Exchange Law and its implementing regulations have been promulgated by the National Government and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and have been ordered by the National Government to take effect simultaneously from June 1st of this year. In addition to sending the law and its implementing regulations to the Brokers Association for their reference, this Exchange must clearly announce them for compliance. According to the law and its implementing regulations, all exchange brokers and commission brokers have an obligation to comply. In particular, Article 29 of the implementing regulations (the notification of a broker's buying, selling, and delivery activities on the exchange shall not take effect unless it is stamped and certified by the exchange to which the broker belongs) has a significant relationship with brokers and commission brokers, and must be given special attention. The facilities of this Exchange have always placed great importance on the status of brokers. All matters concerning the interests of brokers that are observed by this Exchange are announced in a timely manner as a precautionary measure. According to this Exchange's observation of this article, the government's intention in establishing this article is that transactions that are not stamped and certified by the Exchange are actually related to the profits and losses of the Exchange's tax revenue. Furthermore, it is feared that once a dispute arises in such transactions, there is no legal basis and no legal remedy can be obtained. Therefore, in order to prevent all disputes and maintain commercial stability, it is necessary to specifically establish this article to show sanctions. Regardless of whether this legislative intention considers social order, merchant ethics, or national tax revenue, it is also of great benefit to the status of brokers and clients. If brokers and clients can strictly abide by the provisions of this article and earnestly fulfill their obligations, not only can all dangers and malpractices in transactions be eliminated, but also the transactions they carry out will have a legal basis. Even if a dispute occurs, it is not difficult to seek legal remedies in accordance with the law. As for those who only seek petty convenience and engage in illegal activities, is the benefit or harm not clearly distinguishable? For this reason, in addition to requesting that everyone abide by the law and its implementing regulations, we also hope that special attention will be paid to this article.” In addition to notifying the Brokers Association, this announcement is hereby made. After reading it, the reporter finally understood the intention of the Exchange, which was to make it so that notifications of buying and selling parties would not take effect unless they were stamped and certified by the Exchange. However, the essence of the country's legislation was not clearly elaborated. Therefore, the reporter visited a certain official of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for further details. The official made the following statement: (hereinafter, the official's statement) “Although the former Beijing government promulgated the Securities Exchange Law and the Commodity Exchange Regulations, they were brief and riddled with loopholes, which led to abuses that violated the special permits for establishment and prevented the effectiveness of legislation from being realized. The National Government, in view of this, has re-enacted the Exchange Law and its implementing regulations. This is truly a measure by the Central Government to actively rectify industrial and commercial laws and regulations and forcefully correct past malpractices. It has been clearly promulgated and will take effect from June 1st of this year. The most important point is the strict regulation regarding the crackdown on illegal transactions, which is intended to restrict and avoid danger. In the past, the purchase and sale notification letters given by the brokers of various exchanges to the clients on both sides of the transaction (commonly known as the "deal slip") were often not stamped and certified by the exchange, which, from a fundamental point of view, violated the provisions of the current laws and regulations, which is called illegal. In fact, this can evolve into the following abuses, which is called an illegal result: (A) If the transactions made by the broker are not stamped and certified by the exchange to which they belong, then the income from their handling fees will inevitably be reduced. This, from the perspective of the exchange, is harmful and not beneficial. (B) The broker hopes to obtain the handling fee exclusively, and the transactions are not done through proper procedures. From the point of view of profit, there is the possibility of evading exchange fees. From the point of view of harm, if a dispute or loss occurs in the transaction, the client completely denies it, and there is no way to properly resolve the matter. This, from the perspective of the broker, is more harmful than beneficial. (C) If the transaction notification letter has not been legally certified, if the transaction is profitable but the broker completely embezzled it, the client has no legal procedure to prove it and no legal remedy. This, from the client's perspective, is unprofitable and harmful. (D) Since the broker evades the exchange's handling fees, the exchange's income will inevitably decrease, and the exchange tax that the state should collect will also be eroded invisibly. This has a great impact from the perspective of the country. The above four items are based on observations from all aspects, and the abuses can be seen immediately. As for other indirect impacts such as merchant ethics, commercial credit, and social stability, all have a great relationship. In order to avoid the above-mentioned abuses, it is necessary to adopt a strict doctrine and actively crack down on them, showing remedial methods and giving appropriate punishments. This is also a kind of method of the country to promote laws and regulations to eliminate malpractices. In the end, the responsibility of our people lies in following the laws and regulations, and how dare we hesitate and be complacent. We will specifically inform you of the provisions in the Exchange Law and its implementing regulations regarding the crackdown on illegal transactions: Article 50 of the Exchange Law: Those who engage in transactions outside the exchange based on the market price of the exchange and speculate on profits and losses in empty transactions shall be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year or a fine of up to three thousand yuan. Article 29 of the implementing regulations: The notification of a broker's buying, selling, and delivery activities on the exchange shall not take effect unless it is stamped and certified by the exchange to which the broker belongs. Judging from the previous article, illegal transactions without legal procedures not only have the loss of fines but also have criminal responsibility. Exchange brokers and clients on both sides of the transaction should be aware of this, even if they are not considering the country's tax collection, but only considering their own interests, and know that the notification letter must have the stamp and certification of the exchange. In the past, a certain broker in the Japanese transaction department delivered a notification letter that had not been stamped and certified by the transaction department to the client. Afterwards, the broker had accumulated huge assets and resigned from his position for more than ten years. Suddenly, the client sued him, saying that the transaction was illegal. As a result, the broker lost the lawsuit and paid 200,000 yuan in damages to the plaintiff and the transaction department. It can be seen that illegal behavior not only bears the blame at the time but can also be investigated afterwards. We must not try it.”</p>
<p>After listening to this conversation, the reporter of the Guowen News Agency asked if it could be disclosed. Fortunately, it was approved, and the reporter took his leave.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Appeal for Disaster Relief in Shaanxi and Henan <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The disaster situation in Shaanxi and Henan provinces is expanding. The Shanghai Office of the Disaster Relief Committee received a telegram yesterday from Mr. Li Zushen of the Tianjin Shaanxi Disaster Relief Association, stating that he had received a telegram from Mr. Zhu Ziqiao, reporting that the disaster areas in Shaanxi were again suffering from epidemics. Counties such as Xianyang, Xingping, and Liquan were all suffering from barren fields and villages in ruins. The disaster victims were only able to fill their hunger with a small amount of millet mixed with wild vegetables. The elderly and weak were turning to ravines, and the situation was extremely tragic. Emergency relief is currently being carried out rapidly. Although donations from Tianjin are very enthusiastic, they are a drop in the bucket and cannot make up for the loss. The Shanghai area, known as a wealthy area, has many more philanthropists. Please advocate for the rapid raising of large amounts of funds. The disaster victims will be very grateful. Another telegram was received from the Henan Provincial Relief Association, stating that the southeast of Henan was a war zone, and more than ten counties, including Gong, Deng, Qin, and Wen, had suffered from hailstorms, and the wheat harvest was wiped out, and it was difficult to plant grains again. The starving people were about to have no food to eat. They begged for special relief to be provided, and the merit would be immeasurable. It is reported that the Chairman of the Relief Committee, Xu Jingren, and the Director of the Shanghai Office, Wang Yiting, have decided to request the government to allocate funds for relief and to raise funds for emergency relief in the two provinces. All types of materials, food, and medicine are needed. It is reported that the Shanghai Office has received a lot of relief funds and combined Sharen medicinal water in the past few days.</p>

<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association has repeatedly received telegrams and letters from various agencies in Suqian County, Jiangsu Province, and from the disaster relief committees in various bandit-affected areas, including county gentry Liu Junhongyun and others, reporting that the county suffered a severe flood last year, which caused a complete loss of the wheat crop and a complete failure of the autumn harvest. The disaster situation is serious and in urgent need of rescue. The most tragic situation is that a large number of bandits fled from Suijing into the western part of Suqian, to the Yiyong Town, where they burned, killed, looted, and did everything. Dozens of villages, such as Caizhuang, Yanwan, Xixiaozhuang, and Dawangmiao, were all damaged. It is estimated that more than two hundred people were injured, one hundred and sixty people were kidnapped, and countless houses were burned down. To the south, the areas of Caiwei and Sanjietang were occupied by bandits. Although the troops attacked and suppressed the bandits, who fled, they burned and killed more than 800 households along the way. Furthermore, the whole town of Zhatang Jinzhai Town was burned down, and more than 1,000 people were killed. It was truly an unprecedented catastrophe. The poorest people who have suffered the most are exposed to the elements day and night, starving and waiting to die. The cries of women and children are unbearable to hear. They ask for speedy relief, and the merit will be immeasurable. The county has suffered both natural disasters and banditry, and the situation is truly unbearable. The Association has just completed emergency relief work in Baoying and Huaiyin counties in Jiangsu Province, but the natural disasters and banditry in Suqian have come again, and the vastness of the catastrophe is truly unthinkable.</p>

<p>After the labor strike occurred in the main, fourth, and sixth factories of the Meiya Silk Factory in this port, the City Social Bureau convened representatives of the factory and the employers yesterday for a round of mediation. Because the employers' attitude was tough, the mediation failed to make progress. The City Social Bureau had no choice but to instruct the labor representatives to return to the factory and persuade the workers to resume work first and wait for mediation. After the representatives returned to the factory, they immediately convened a meeting of all the workers and persuaded them to resume work. However, the workers believed that the employers had no sincerity in accepting mediation, and all the workers vowed not to resume work. The representatives were unable to obtain any results and had to request the City Social Bureau to send personnel for mediation again.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Recent News on the Case of the Appeal to Repair the Tang Pagodas in Western Zhejiang <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang West Tang Dynasty Baoxing Twin Pagodas, since someone hoped to demolish and sell them, have been opposed by the Pinghu fellow villagers in Shanghai and by the gentry in Beijing, Hangzhou, and the local area. Letters and telegrams have been sent to all levels of government. First, the Ministry of Interior ordered an investigation, followed by instructions from the Zhejiang Civil Affairs Department to the Pinghu County Magistrate not to demolish them without authorization. However, the County Magistrate vaguely reported to the Civil Affairs Department, claiming that they were extremely dangerous and contained other untrue statements. After receiving the report, the Zhejiang Civil Affairs Department, believing that it was unreasonable, specially sent Zhang Dinghua, a staff member of the Seventh Section, to the site to climb the pagoda and push it. However, it did not move at all, as the County Magistrate had claimed that it swayed in the wind. Therefore, he re-examined the North Temple with the County Magistrate. As a result, they advocated repairing the pagoda and made an agreement with the local people who advocated repairing the pagoda, stipulating that work must begin within two months to avoid delays. The original agreement is now recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Agreement signed by Shen Songqing and others. The reason for the agreement is that the Baoxing Twin Pagodas built in the Tang Dynasty in front of the Beisi Temple in the county seat of Pinghu have been in disrepair for many years, and the wind and rain have eroded them, posing a danger. Songqing and others, in order to preserve the antiquities, have decided to repair them and have already prepared the estimated costs for the project and submitted them to the Civil Affairs Department for approval. However, it is heard that many local people are advocating for their demolition. Now, with the approval of the committee members, Songqing has made an agreement that if the order from the Civil Affairs Department is received, work must begin to repair them within two months. If the work has not started after two months, the county government and various legal entities may discuss their demolition, and no further objections will be raised. The method of repair is agreed upon as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Songqing and others, in order to preserve the antiquities, have decided to repair the Tang Pagodas. The ruins of the North Temple are numerous and require a large amount of labor. The repair of the halls is not included.</p>
<p>(2) When repairing the twin pagodas, the county government and various legal entities must convene a meeting to discuss how to collect funds and broaden the benefits. The people who advocate repairing the pagoda are naturally the preparation committee members.</p>
<p>(3) When repairing the twin pagodas, an engineer with architectural knowledge from Shanghai must be hired to repair them using scientific methods.</p>
<p>(4) The foundation of the twin pagodas must be solidified with concrete, and the body and top of the pagodas must be supported by steel bones.</p>
<p>(5) After the twin pagodas are repaired, they must not lose their original appearance in order to preserve the original meaning of the antiquities.</p>
<p>(6) After the twin pagodas are repaired, the Civil Affairs Department should be requested to order the demolition of the two small houses next to the pagoda, which are managed by the county education association's property association, and establish a stone railing around the pagoda to enhance the appearance and protect the antiquities.</p>
<p>The agreement is true. Agreement signed by Shen Songqing, Zhang Fuhou, Ran Rongqing, Cheng Jun, Xue Zhenji, Mo Xiangji, Zhao Lin, Ge Changmei, Feng Hao, and Committee Member Zhang Dinghua on June 8th, the 19th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<p>The Fairy brand of cigarettes managed by Yongtaihe, an agent of the British American Tobacco Company in this city, has now increased by 42 yuan per case based on the original price, the British brand has increased by 15 yuan per case, and the Golden brand has increased by 10 yuan. Before the fact, the various cigarette exchange houses did not know the news in advance. By the time the new warehouse orders of the various Chinese merchant companies in Liaohua were also stopped, they were about to increase in succession. Asking for the reason, they were all affected by the gold rush, and the raw materials for tobacco leaves had increased several times. It is now heard that various colleagues have specially requested the guild to send a letter to each company stating that the price increase should be notified to the guild in advance in order to facilitate the circulation of information, and the retail prices can also be re-negotiated to avoid uneven profits and losses. After the guild accepted the request, the meeting will be convened and conducted.</p>

<p>Xiaobang Bay Head Hides the Kidnapped Victims</p>
<p>The Life and Death of Two Kidnapped Victims is Unknown</p>
<p>The Fugitive Bandits are Being Closely Pursued</p>
<p>At 9:15 last night, a Chinese police officer, number 472, of the French Concession Police was patrolling near the intersection of Avenue de la Grandiere and Rue Massenet when he suddenly saw a boy, about ten years old, wearing a willow-colored cloth short shirt and trousers, running towards him in a panic, staggering, and crying as he ran. He kept looking back as if he was afraid that someone would be chasing him from behind. The police officer was suspicious and stopped him to inquire. As soon as the child saw the police officer, he immediately stopped crying and spoke in the Wujiang dialect. He told the police officer that he had been kidnapped by bandits from Suzhou and hidden in a nearby bungalow in Shanghai for ten days. Because the bandits were all asleep, he was able to take the opportunity to escape from the bandit den and asked for help. The police officer, knowing that he was a kidnapped victim, immediately took him to the Lujiiawan Police Station. The chief of detectives was afraid that the bandits would escape upon hearing the news, so he did not have time to question the kidnapped victim. He immediately used the telephone to notify the Special Agency of Avenue Joffre to gather Chinese and foreign detectives, all wearing steel bulletproof vests and carrying weapons, and travel in cars. They first arrived at the main police station to meet the kidnapped victim and Chinese police officer number 472, and then drove straight to the Xiaobang Bay area of Avenue de la Grandiere and Rue Massenet. The kidnapped victim identified the location clearly, and the detectives rushed in and captured two people on the spot. No pistols were found. They were immediately taken into the police station. After the chief of detectives questioned them one by one, both bandits claimed to be from Anhui. According to the kidnapped victim, his name was Yuan Wenmei, twelve years old. He lived in a village about three miles away from Wujiang, Suzhou (the place name is unknown). His parents were both alive, his father's name was Zhong Sheng, and his grandfather's name was Youqing, who was already seventy-two years old. His brother's nickname was Heshang. The ancestral fields were about thirty mu. Ten days ago, at dusk, more than ten local bandits, each holding a pistol, kidnapped him (the kidnapped victim himself), his grandfather, and his cousin Wensong (twelve years old), the only son of his uncle, to a small steamer, which sailed directly to Shanghai. Upon arriving in Shanghai, the three of them were hidden separately. He was hidden in the bungalow, guarded by three men and one woman in shifts, and suffered abuse. Tonight (i.e., last night), all four bandits were extremely tired and went to sleep. He waited until they were all asleep before lightly opening the door and escaping. On the way, he was fortunate enough to meet a Chinese police officer who rescued him. However, he did not know where his grandfather and cousin were being hidden by the bandits. The chief of detectives, after hearing the confession, ordered the two bandits to be detained separately and issued an order to all detectives to strictly arrest the fugitive bandits and rescue the other two kidnapped victims.</p>
<p>Ren Kang Pawnshop on Zhabei Xinmin Road</p>
<h3 id="e131">Suffers Fire <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The entire three-section house was almost completely burned down.</p>
<p>Huge losses, fortunately no one was injured.</p>
<p>The Ren Kang Pawnshop at No. 1073, Zhabei Xinmin Road, suddenly caught fire at around 8:00 p.m. yesterday. The entire three-section, twenty-two-room house was completely burned down, causing huge losses. After the fire broke out, the fire brigades of Zhabei immediately drove to the scene and tried their best to put out the fire. However, because the area was large and the clothes and other items were easily ignited, it was not extinguished until around 10:00 p.m. It took about two hours in total. Fortunately, the neighboring houses were not affected and no one was injured.</p>
<p>Ren Kang Pawnshop was founded in the late Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty and has been in business for more than twenty years. The shareholders are Wang, Li, Hu, and others, with a total investment of 50,000 yuan. The current manager, Qian Meisheng, has been in office for many years, and is also the manager of Bao Kang Pawnshop on Gonghe Xin Road, as they are associated stores. Ren Kang house has three sections, the first and second sections have three rooms each and three floors, the last section has two rooms and two floors, for a total of twenty-two rooms. The first section downstairs is the shop, and the upstairs is the clothes room. The second section downstairs is the jewelry room and the money room, and the two floors upstairs are also clothes rooms. The last section is the kitchen and the staff dormitory. There are about twenty-two staff members, from the manager to the package handlers, ticket writers, and students. The business is usually very prosperous, and the credit is also good. It is a giant of the pawnshop industry in Zhabei. Usually, it closes at around 7:30 p.m. If there are many customers, the closing time is extended. At around 8:00 p.m. last night, about forty minutes after closing, a thick smoke suddenly filled the third floor of the front section, followed by flames that went straight to the rear section of the house. In an instant, the flames spewed out from all directions and spread up and down, out of control. All the partners, in addition to sounding the alarm and rescuing, were all pale with fear. After hearing the news, the fire brigades of all sections drove to the scene to put out the fire, but because the house was tall and there were many rooms, the water pressure could not reach effectively. The flames, like snakes, were竄ing between the doors and windows, and in an instant, like rotten wood, the buildings collapsed and all the pledged items were burned to ashes. The exact amount of the loss could not be known for a while. The Public Security Bureau of the Fourth District sent more than 20 police officers to the scene to suppress and detain a ticket clerk named Tan Zhonglin. The manager was out when the fire broke out and had not returned. The house was insured. The cause of the fire is unknown. However, recently, there have been workers working on the upper floor to repair the house, and all of them had left when the fire broke out. The house is the property of Yuanye Company and has been built for many years. Famous jockey.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Determined to Divorce <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Milna's Magic is Truly Immense</p>
<p>Hu Huilin Does Not Miss the Old Feelings at All</p>
<p>Ms. Fang Has Filed a Counterclaim</p>
<p>The Matter of Reconciliation is Almost Hopeless</p>
<p>Famous jockey Hu Huilin married Ms. Fang Wenxian, the younger sister of Yongshang Fang Jiaobai, sixteen years ago, and they have several children. Since the magician Lande Shan came to Shanghai to perform, Hu and Lande's eldest daughter, Milna, fell in love. Later, Milna went to Tianjin and then abroad with her father, and Hu followed closely behind. Recently, he sent a letter from abroad asking lawyer Wei in Shanghai to file a lawsuit with the Special District Court to allow him to divorce Fang Wenxian. After one summons, the two parties were ordered to reconcile outside of court, as reported in the previous newspaper. Although the mediation was conducted by the lawyers of both parties, it was not very effective. Ms. Fang also ordered her lawyer to file a counterclaim against Hu Huilin, demanding that Hu allocate assets worth 60,000 yuan to provide for her alimony and her children's education expenses. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Yi opened the court to continue the trial. First, Fang Wenxian's lawyer stated the reasons for the counterclaim, saying that the two had been married for sixteen years and had seven children. The reason Hu filed for divorce this time was entirely because he was infatuated with Milna. It was found that Milna was the daughter of the performer Lande Shan. Lande brought her to Shanghai in the winter of the sixteenth year to perform, and Hu began to fall in love with her. Later, Milna went to Tianjin and then abroad, and Hu also followed. At first, he still provided for the family, but after January of this year, he abandoned his wife and children and asked for a divorce in a letter. His wording was firm, saying that if Ms. Fang did not agree, he would file a criminal lawsuit and never return, which was close to blackmail. The lawyer then presented a photo of Milna and a foreign diary of Hu Huilin as evidence, stating that the photo was given to Hu Huilin by Milna and was titled "Given to My Lover" and expressed the hope that their marriage could be resolved satisfactorily. The lawyer also submitted two letters, one from Hu to Fang before he filed for divorce, expressing three points in the letter: (1) He would not hide any money if he had it (2) He would never take a concubine (3) He would never have two hearts, otherwise he would be a beast. It can be seen that the two were previously harmonious. One was a letter from Hu's sister to Ms. Fang after Hu changed his mind, blaming her brother for changing his mind so quickly, saying that "a man's heart is really unpredictable." However, since Fang's alimony was cut off, she has been living on borrowed money for several months. Now, in addition to not wanting a divorce and demanding an allocation of 60,000 yuan of property, she also asks to have Hu's Baidehua firm and shares in the China Jockey Club seized. Next, Hu Huilin's lawyer stated that the relationship between the two parties has now become irreparable, and the reason for this situation is that Fang Wenxian has made it so. Fang is extravagant and, when money is scarce, she sells Hu's awards. When Hu went abroad to do business in the autumn of last year, he left 2,000 yuan in cash at home. This year, he transferred another 3,500 yuan from Baide. Now she still claims to be living on borrowed money. Spending 5,500 yuan in a few months and still borrowing money is clear proof of extravagance. The most painful thing for Hu is the matter of hiring someone to have an abortion. It is a pity that the person has not been invited to court to prove it. As for whether the photo was titled by Milna, it has not been proven. If Hu has assets, giving 60,000 is not impossible, but Baide is not owned by Hu, and the number of shareholders in the China Jockey Club is only 8,000 and has already been mortgaged. He requested permission to divorce and rejected the counterclaim. Fang's lawyer then took out various awards won by Hu from the trunk, such as gold medals, silver shields, and silver tripods, to prove that they had not been sold. Finally, Prosecutor Xu expressed his opinion, saying that the best solution to this case is reconciliation. If one party insists on divorce, then the other party should be given more compensation for the loss. Judge Yang then announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentence to be announced on the morning of the 27th of this month. He also ordered the two parties to reconcile during this period.</p>

<p>Please Perform an Abortion in the Hope of Generous Thanks</p>
<p>Use Ingenious Tactics to Deceive and Take Away Clothing</p>
<p>In recent times, the situation is not peaceful, the world is deteriorating, petty thefts are rampant, and the tricks of deception are becoming more and more refined, making people unpredictable. Recently, it was heard that a new kind of rice seedling technique was discovered in Wusong, so that the victims willingly endured the pain without declaring it. Not only did they not dare to report to the official authorities to arrest them, but even when relatives and friends went to inquire, they were unwilling to tell the truth. They allowed the rogues to wander outside the law. Their plan was truly unsurpassed.</p>
<p>A woman surnamed Yang in the western countryside of Songjiang, over forty years old, whose husband, Jin, had passed away many years ago, leaving behind fields and houses, so that the whole family was able to live in warmth and satiety. Because Yang's mother used to work as a midwife, Yang also knew a little about midwifery surgery. The other day, a person who spoke with a Hakka accent suddenly came to Yang's house and invited her to go to a certain mansion in Shanghai to perform a private abortion. Yang, in the hope of generous thanks, did not scrutinize the matter and rashly agreed. The person, seeing that Yang had agreed, immediately used deceptive tactics, saying that robberies were quite common on the road to Shanghai, so you should take off your gold ring, gold bracelets, silk clothes, etc. and hide them at home to avoid theft. Hearing this, Yang believed it to be golden words and was extremely sincere, so she took off her silk clothes and gold jewelry and went with the person. They boarded the train, and when they arrived at Zhang Huabang Station, the person ordered Yang to get off the train, saying that they had come with a friend, so they should find the friend and return together. You wait here. Yang did not yet know that this was a trick. The person went straight to Yang's house and told Yang's daughter (seventeen years old), "Your mother listened to my words at the time and took off her clothes and jewelry. Now she thinks that Shanghai values clothes and not people, and is afraid of being looked down upon, so she specially ordered me to come and take the clothes and jewelry. If you don't believe me, you can bring the things and go with me to give them to your mother in person." Hearing this, the girl packed the gold jewelry and silk clothes (worth about a hundred yuan) that her mother had taken off into a small package and went with the person. Unexpectedly, the person led the girl to the flag station in Wusong Town and pretended to look for her mother. Before long, the person saw a train arriving and immediately said to the girl, "Your mother is on the train, bring the things here." As he spoke, he forcibly took the package of clothes. The girl was about to board the train, but the train had already started, so she had to return home. After the mother and daughter met, they realized that they had been deceived and could only regret it endlessly. Wusong Hotel.</p>

<p>Unable to Find Work, Wife and Children Flee, Forced to Take This Step</p>
<p>A traveler came to Fuchang Hotel on Songxin Road, Wusong, the previous night and opened room number five. The name written on the circulation book was Xu Ming. That night, the guest closed the door and went to bed. However, by 11:30 a.m. yesterday, he had not gotten up. The tea room was quite surprised and called out from the door, but there was no sound at all. Later, the tea room vaguely saw the guest hanging from the beam from the crack in the door and was greatly alarmed. He immediately reported to the hotel owner, Cai Wenzhi, and reported to the Seventh District Public Security Bureau. At the same time, he tried to break open the door. Fortunately, the guest had not been suicide for long and was still breathing weakly. The tea room untied him and rescued him. After a long time, he recovered. Three suicide notes were found in the drawer of the small table, one to his father, one to his cousin Xu Jiejie (who is currently the Dean of Academics at the Wusong Merchant Marine School), and one to the Fuchang Hotel. The police then took him to the Seventh District Public Security Bureau. After Xu, a staff member, interrogated him, he confessed that his name was Xu Qiutian, 28 years old, from Shaoxing. He used to work in Hangzhou and is now unemployed. He came to Shanghai but could not find work. His clothes were pawned and his wife and children fled home. He had no travel expenses. He went to Wusong the other day but did not meet his cousin Xu Jiejie. Life was so tragic that he had no choice but to take this step. There was no other reason. After hearing the confession, Xu comforted him and then sent the Fuchang owner Cai Wenru to buy him four yuan and sent him to the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to return to his hometown in Shaoxing under police escort from the Seventh District. The letter from Xu Qiutian to his parents is now copied as follows:</p>
<p>To My Dear Parents:</p>
<p>Since I have been unemployed in Hangzhou, I have been to various places to find work but have not found a job. I have been staying at Zhonglin Brother's place for a long time. Land is expensive in Shanghai and I cannot stay for long. I have run out of money. I have tried to find work at my third brother's place in Wusong several times. It was not until the 11th that he replied to me in a letter, saying that I should find another way. I don't even know where my wife and children have gone. Life has been so difficult. After thinking about it again and again, I only have one way to die and end this floating life. I hope you both take care of your health and don't worry about me. If my wife and children return home, tell them to remarry and not to keep an empty room for me. My body can be thrown into the Wusong Yi grave. There is no need to transport it back to my hometown to avoid being talked about by others. With this, I respectfully wish you good health.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Public Works Committee Meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>June 3rd, 4:30 PM, the Shanghai Municipal Council held a Public Works Committee meeting. Present: Mr. Bair, Mr. Reis Lien, Mr. Hutch, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Director of Public Works, Director of Accounting, Deputy General Manager, etc. Mr. Bair chaired the meeting. The minutes of the discussed cases are as follows: (1) Approved the minutes of the previous meeting. (2) Case of increased transportation costs for the Pingqiao stone quarry. The contractor of the Pingqiao stone quarry has requested the Council to revise the contract terms due to the increase in transportation costs. The Director of Public Works reported that the waterway through which the stone-carrying vessels pass is currently blocked due to dredging and will be closed for about eight months. During this period, all vessels must detour, which was not taken into account in the contract. Since the merchant has submitted a request, a subsidy of 5,000 taels should be given. After discussion, the case was approved by all members. (3) Case of collecting surcharges for land acquisition. Mr. Brooke, Chairman of the Land Commission for this year, wrote to the Council inquiring how the method of land purchase and pricing should be regulated, as disputes often arise on the matter at the meetings. The Deputy General Manager is in charge of the case files and debates on this issue. The main point of the debate is whether a subsidy of one-tenth of the original price should be given for compulsory land acquisition for road construction. Mr. Brooke's opinion is that since Shanghai is an international public concession, the Land Commission cannot be bound by the laws of any country, and the methods formulated by the commissioners should be based on equality. The Deputy General Manager stated that according to the case files, the method of land acquisition for road construction has been implemented since the Land Regulations of 1919, which overturned the one-tenth of a percent fee method in the Land Regulations of 1845, because this subsidy method does not exist in European and American countries. Last year, the purchase of land on North Sichuan Road from the Ye Guang Company was not given a subsidy, but the company is still demanding it. Although Mr. Brooke proposed that the Land Commission should not be controlled by the laws of any country, his proposal to adopt equality is not supported, because the Council's method of land purchase and pricing should be handled according to the Land Boundary Regulations. Therefore, the Land Commission should also base its valuation of land on the Land Boundary Regulations. The method of land purchase and pricing has always been stipulated in the Land Boundary Regulations, but the subsidy of 11% has not been noted in the regulations, so the Council has no right to pay it. Even if a subsidy is sometimes given, it is only considered an extra compensation and cannot be considered a formal regulation. Although Section B of Article 6 of the Regulations stipulates a percentage of compulsory purchase fees for land acquisition for railway construction, Section A of Article 6 does not specify this when acquiring land for public use. However, the owners often believe that this land subsidy should still be issued, but they do not know that the Council's method of pricing is based on the Land Boundary Regulations. Therefore, the Committee replied to Mr. Brooke stating that the Land Commission's method of determining land prices is based on the Land Boundary Regulations. (4) Case of widening North Suzhou Road and National Day Road. According to the width of National Day Road widened in the Chinese area, the Director of Public Works intends to purchase land from Land Registry Book No. 1, with an area of 3.16 acres and a price of 18,940 taels (including engineers' fees). Although this land is not within the designated route, the Director of Public Works is aware that the owner is very willing to change the design and sell this land so that the rest of the property can be developed. All the above discussed items have been approved. The meeting adjourned at 5:40 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Clearing of Floating Coffins in the North and South City <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Sanitary Bureau has previously sent personnel to investigate no less than several thousand cases of floating coffins in the city. With the summer approaching, they pose a major obstacle to sanitation. It is now known that Sanitary Bureau Chief Hu Hongji, together with the Public Security Bureau, has already cleared all floating coffins with or without owners within the North and South City limits. The original report submitted to the city government for filing is recorded as follows: A report is hereby submitted for the matter of reporting the case of banning floating coffins in the city. Previously, the bureau and other authorities jointly issued a proclamation ordering the coffin owners to move the coffins themselves. All ownerless coffins were to be buried by charitable organizations. A meeting was also convened with various charitable organizations to discuss and decide to start with the North and South City. Later, the Pushan Villa reported that the burial situation in the South City was slightly different from the reports of various districts. The bureau then urged them to continue to be responsible for handling the matter, and to clear the floating coffins in the North and South City as soon as possible. Order No. 4991 of the Superior Government was approved for filing. Now, according to the Pushan Villa's letter, although there are thousands of floating coffins in the South City, the coffins with owners have all been moved by themselves. All 195 ownerless coffins previously reported to have been buried have been verified by the district land guards and buried in accordance with the resolution. They have now been cleared. The above-mentioned sections are true. As for the floating coffins in other districts, they should be buried in order as soon as possible to supplement the original case. In addition to the bureau and other authorities convening another meeting of the municipal commissioners of various districts and various charitable organizations to discuss methods and actively proceed, a written report is hereby submitted for consideration and filing.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Subscription for Electric Company Shares Fully Subscribed <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Power Company recently issued 80,000 preferred shares with an interest rate of six taels, totaling 8 million taels. The company was fully subscribed within a few days of offering the shares, and there were many people who regretted not being able to subscribe. Most of the buyers were well-known Chinese and foreign banks. The company's employees only managed to purchase 20,000 shares. This is because the market is chaotic and investors are generally unwilling to try ordinary businesses. However, the electric power business in the concession is very profitable and extremely reliable.</p>

<p>The four robbers Tang Bao Bao, Wu Chang Bao, Wu Xing Gen, and Wu A Rong, who robbed the Junpu Bureau's salary and shot and killed two Chinese and Western engineers, were transferred by the Water Police Station to the Special District Court for trial. It is now known that the Chinese Local Court, in accordance with the jurisdiction of the Junpu River, believes that the court of jurisdiction for this case is the Chinese court. Therefore, the Prosecutor's Office of the Local Court appointed Prosecutor Liu Pingfan to investigate. Prosecutor Liu prepared a document and dispatched four bailiffs to the Special District Court yesterday morning to request the return of the case for trial. After Judge Xu of the Special District Court opened the court for questioning, the police were immediately handed over to bring them back for questioning. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Liu opened the court for a preliminary hearing of the defendants and ordered them to be detained for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e143">He Qiqing, Who Escaped in a Major Fraud Case, Has Been Rearrested <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<h3 id="e144">The Two Guarantors Are Relieved of a Heavy Burden <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The 630,000 major fraud case, which was originally scheduled to be sentenced on the 29th of last month after the debate was concluded, was not sentenced on the due date because He Qiqing, who was released on bail, had disappeared without a trace and a warrant was issued for his arrest. The two copper-making households who had guaranteed He were responsible for the guarantee and searched everywhere. At first, they went to He's house in Zhabei, but it had already been moved. It was not until the afternoon of the day before yesterday that they learned that he was hiding in a workshop in Yangshupu. The guarantor reported to the Xinzha Police Station, which dispatched detectives to arrest He. Yesterday afternoon, he was sent to the Special District Local Court along with Yang Shulin, the mastermind of the fraud case. Judge Sun Yuan presided over the fifth court for further trial. He's two guarantors arrived in court and requested to withdraw their guarantee. Judge Sun approved the cancellation of the guarantee, and the two were relieved of a heavy burden and happily left. Then, the Western Detective reported the details of He's arrest. Judge Sun then summoned the plaintiff Cao Youshan for questioning. According to Cao, Yang Shulin fled on the sixteenth day of the first lunar month. The next day, the clerk of his business received a letter and learned about it. Then, the tea servant of the Tongzhou Steamboat sent Yang's letter, saying that he was injured after being kidnapped and was being treated at the Weihaiwei Hospital. It was not until the tea servant of the Dongya Travel Report received a letter from Yang in Tianjin that he learned that the previous claims of being kidnapped were all lies. He then sent someone to Tianjin to persuade him to come to Shanghai and open an Anle Palace hotel to settle the accounts. However, he immediately thought of escaping and hired a car with his concubine Chen Huanxi to escape. He first pointed out his partner He Shiqing, and He confessed that Yang was hiding in the Guangdong Hotel on North Sichuan Road, so he went to arrest him. He's suffering was entirely deceived by Xie Kai, because Xie was his clerk and Yang's manager, and he always boasted that Yang's business was prosperous, which led to his being deceived. Then, Chen, a member of the Zhabei Fire Brigade, stated that the association had deposited a total of more than 8,000 yuan in the Wenji Hexing companies, involving dozens of people. Judge Sun then questioned Yang about the use of the money. Yang still claimed that it was for interest payments and business failures. He Qiqing, who was questioned, evaded the issue and hired a lawyer to request that he be allowed to be released on bail. However, the lawyer of the police station and the lawyers of the creditors all expressed their opposition. Judge Sun ordered the two defendants to be taken into custody pending sentencing on the morning of the 17th of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Private Minting of Counterfeit Coins Discovered <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Yang Ning'an, a native of Ningbo, was arrested on North Henan Road and found with 25 counterfeit Shuangjiao coins on his person. He was taken to the Huishi Police Station for investigation. According to Yang, he bought them from Zhu Zhisheng, a native of Suzhou, for 15 counterfeit Shuangjiao coins per yuan. The time of the transaction was every day at 8:00 or 9:00 AM, and the location was on the Suzhou River on North Chengdu Road. Chinese and Western detectives went to the address on the previous morning and arrested Zhu. They found more than 100 Shuangjiao coins on his person. According to Zhu, the private minting facility was located at No. 5 Rangde Lane, Baoshan Road, Zhabei. Detectives from the police station went to the facility and found 37 yuan of lead-containing silver dollars, 429 lead-containing Shuangjiao coins, two sets of molds for making fake silver dollars, nine sets of molds for fake Shuangjiao coins, two dry batteries, and white powder, as well as Chen Liansheng and Ye Mujin. They were temporarily detained at the police station. Yesterday morning, Zhu Zhisheng was sent to the Special District Local Court. Judge Sun questioned the police station lawyer and requested to prepare a document to take away the physical evidence and witnesses and postpone the trial. Zhu confessed that he had been idle for a long time, and Chen and Ye asked him to send hundreds of lead coins to the Xinzha Bridge every morning and give them to a man named Yang, who would pay him five yuan. He received a wage of six jiao per day. Judge Sun ordered Zhu to be detained and rescheduled the trial.</p>

<p>Bao Shi Visited a Friend and Was Arrested Xu Shi (44 years old), a native of Chongming, had no children and owned a small property. She was about to adopt her nephew Yunlong as her son. Yunlong was already in his teens and his mother had arranged for him to marry Wang Xiuzhen (19 years old), a fellow villager. Xiuzhen had bright eyes and white teeth and was very beautiful, and she had received a higher education. After marrying into the family, she saw that her husband was blind in one eye and had rough black skin, like a country bumpkin, and she had no affection for him. Xiuzhen was unhappy and felt sorry for herself for marrying the wrong person. A neighbor, Lu Fu, was young and handsome and loved to dress up. Seeing Xiuzhen's beauty and marrying a fool, he was unhappy and took the opportunity to seduce Xiuzhen with sweet words. Lu was a talented and gentle man, and the two fell in love. However, Xiuzhen's husband and aunt were very strict in their surveillance. Although they secretly met, they could not satisfy their desires, so they decided to elope. They agreed to secretly flee to Shanghai some time ago. Xu Shi learned that her daughter-in-law was abducted by Lu Fu, so she followed her to Shanghai and stayed at her relative's house to search for her. The day before yesterday, she met a fellow villager who told her the location of Xiuzhen's residence. She went to the Guang'an Hotel on North Zhejiang Road and asked about room 35, where Lu and Xiuzhen were staying together. Lu and his friend Bao Shi (a native of Wuxi) and Xiuzhen were in the room talking. After hearing Xu Shi's voice, Lu realized that things were not going well and immediately escaped through the back door without a trace. Xiuzhen waited for her aunt to enter the room and then pretended to be diligent and went out to pour tea, also taking the opportunity to escape. Only Lu's friend Bao Shi and Xu Shi were left in the room. Later, because Xiuzhen did not return, she knew she had escaped and called the police to take Bao to the First Section of the Fourth District. After questioning by Chief Yao, Bao Shi confessed that he was 22 years old and was a friend of Lu and did not know about the abduction of Xiuzhen. The chief of the section, believing that the case involved adultery and abduction, prepared a document yesterday and sent it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for verification.</p>

<p>Wang Nenghai, a native of Wusong and a former steward, whose residence is located at No. 2, White Sai Zhong Road, French Concession, has a second daughter, Wang Shuzhen, who is not yet married at the age of 20. This spring, she went to her sister's husband, Chen Guitang, to visit her sister, and had a relationship with her brother-in-law, Chen Guitang. She stayed for a long time and did not return. Her father, Wang Nenghai, learned about this and reported it to the police station, ordering the detectives to arrest Chen and Shuzhen and bring them to the French Public Hall. They were ordered to verify the situation, which has been reported in the previous report. Yesterday, they were again summoned for questioning. The plaintiff claimed that his daughter was so indecent that he did not want to take her back and asked to allow his younger brother to take her away. The Chinese and Western officials sentenced Chen Guitang to three months of imprisonment with a three-year suspension. Wang Shuzhen was taken back by her aunt and disciplined. The father hopes that his daughter will correct her mistakes.</p>

<p>Wu Xinglong, a 56-year-old native of Zhenjiang residing on Haixing Road in Pudong, is a barber. His son, Changgen, is 30 years old and works with his father. He left home ten years ago and did not return until February of this year. Then, he and his wife moved to the vicinity of Tuditang. His wife, Zhang, works in the British-American Tobacco Factory. Recently, Wu and Changgen often quarreled because Changgen was addicted to gambling and had not changed his ways. They fought and were taken to the Third District Police Station together, and Zhang also arrived at the same time. After questioning by the district chief, Xinglong confessed that his son Changsheng was addicted to gambling and had been warned repeatedly but did not change his ways. He left home ten years ago without saying goodbye and still had not changed his ways when he returned. His gambling had impoverished the family and requested that he be ordered to change his ways. According to Changsheng, Xinglong is not his biological father. Soon after he married, he actually committed the act of "digging ashes," having an affair with his wife Zhang. Therefore, he was extremely angry and left home ten years ago to do business and did not want to witness this scandal at home. This year, when he returned home, he saw that the two were still cohabiting, so he moved his wife to another place to sever their relationship. Now, Xinglong, seeing that he had not succeeded, accused him of interfering with gambling and instead sought trouble with him. At that time, Xinglong continued to say that Changsheng was indeed not his biological son, but he adopted him and raised him when he was eight years old. His wife Zhang was also raised in his home when she was seven years old. At that time, he treated the two as children. Later, when they grew up, he made the decision to marry them and turn them into his children and grandchildren, hoping that he would have someone to rely on when he was old. How dare he imitate the act of "digging ashes" and ruin his reputation? Zhang confessed that her husband Changgen was indeed too addicted to gambling, which caused great turmoil in the family. Her clothes were also pawned by him. If he could immediately change his ways, the family could still be harmonious as before. She also strongly denied the claim of having an affair with her father-in-law. The district chief intended to mediate and sentenced Changsheng to five days of detention to show his repentance and appease Xinglong's anger. Unexpectedly, Changgen roared loudly, claiming that he was not satisfied with the detention and would rather go to court to clarify what was good and what was evil. The district chief, seeing that the two sides could not resolve the issue peacefully, allowed both parties, along with Zhang, to be sent to the Local Court for questioning.</p>

<p>Ge Zhang, a 25-year-old woman from Taixing who lives in a shed in the Huifeng Oil Factory in West Shanghai, works in a cotton mill. Her husband, Ge, often travels with the ship because he works on the ship and only occasionally returns home. The woman is usually very frugal. Recently, Zhou Younian, a neighbor, saw that the woman was living alone at home and wanted to take advantage of her, but had no opportunity. He would occasionally make jokes, but the woman ignored him. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at about 9:00 PM, Zhou's animal instincts erupted. He entered her room while she was about to sleep and pressed her on the bed and raped her. Seeing that she was weak and could not resist, the woman shouted loudly. Zhou was afraid and fled. As soon as he went out, he was grabbed by the woman, who used all her strength, and called the police, who arrested him and brought him to the First Section of the Sixth District Police Station. After questioning by Chief Ren, the plaintiff Zhang confessed that she was 25 years old and from Taixing. The defendant Zhou Younian confessed that he was 30 years old and from Taizhou. After obtaining the confessions, Chief Ren, believing that the case involved the rape of a woman, immediately prepared a document and sent it to the court for questioning.</p>

<p>Shen Gaofu, a native of Yuyao, was driving a car on Datong Road in Zhabei yesterday at about 11:30 AM when the driver accidentally hit three pedestrians, Yin Youke, Xu Guisheng, and Xu Chen. The police took Shen to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau. Shen claimed that he was visiting his friend Yang A'quan, who runs a car business on Datong Road. Seeing a car parked on the side of the road, he thought it was driven by Yang, so he got in and tried to drive it, but accidentally injured someone. He asked for forgiveness. The district chief ordered him to be sent to the Judicial Section for verification. The injured Yin Youke is a native of Yongkang and resides at No. 25 Changan Road. He was injured in his waist, legs, and back. Xu Guisheng, 37 years old, is a native of Changshu and resides at No. 2126 Xiexing Lane, Wenjian Temple Road. He is a vendor and was injured in both feet.

<p>Ji Xingsheng, a 26-year-old shoemaker from Changzhou, was drinking tea at Qule Garden on Tangshan Road at around 2:30 PM yesterday when he was stabbed in the right waist by a foe with a sharp blade, causing four wounds. Ji called the police, and the Chinese police from the Huishan Police Station arrested the murderer, Shui Xiangsheng. Those who know the details say that Shui, 39 years old and from Jiangyin, was also a partner in Wu Shunxing's shoe shop last year. This year, he was dismissed and worked in a shoe shop in Xujiahui. His wife is 12 years younger than Shui. She came to Shanghai last week, went straight to Wu Shunxing's to find her husband, and met Ji Xingsheng and Zhou Bingsheng, who told her that her husband had been dismissed and was now working in Xujiahui. However, their words were malicious. Shui's wife wanted to see her husband, so Zhou Bingsheng accompanied her to Xujiahui to find him, but they did not meet him. Then, Zhou borrowed a dollar from a friend and led the woman to the Xihua Hotel on Huaji Road. Whether or not there was any illicit behavior between the two is unknown to outsiders. However, Shui Xiangsheng heard about this and was very angry. Yesterday afternoon, he invited Ji and Zhou to Jule Garden to drink tea and reason with them. When they disagreed, he suddenly used a blade to stab Ji, causing him to be injured. Ji is now being treated at the Tongren Hospital, and it can be said that he brought it on himself.</p>

<p>Chen Ruian and Chen Fengshan, who were arrested for causing a conflict between outsiders and workers at the factory of the Tianyi Umami Mother Food Company at No. 784 Taopeng Road, have been sent to the Special District Local Court for questioning, as reported in this newspaper. After this case occurred, Tong A'qing, the foreman of Tianyi, claimed that Zhang Shoupeng, the property manager of Jiecheng Silver Company, the landlord, had instigated the incident. He went to Zhang's house to argue with him, so Zhang hired a lawyer to sue Tong. Yesterday morning, Judge Ge questioned them and simultaneously questioned the two Chens. According to Tianyi's worker Ma Rongzhang and others, Chen Fengshan was holding an axe during the conflict and Zhang Shoupeng was actually instigating the incident. When questioned, Chen Ruian confessed that he was mistaken for a thug because he was passing by and was struck on the head. Chen Fengshan also denied participating in the attack. Then, Zhang Shoupeng confessed that he was the accounting clerk of Jiecheng's leased property. Tianyi initially only rented eight rooms and now wants to rent several more rooms. So, he tried to force the old tenants to move out and rent to Tianyi, so Tianyi agreed to give him 60 yuan every year and 20 yuan for each festival. He did not know about the fight that day. Tong A'qing, the foreman of Tianyi, gathered a crowd to look for trouble at his house after the incident. Fortunately, he escaped through the back door. Moreover, Tianyi's staff proved that the leaser of Jiecheng was the lawyer Jiang Yiping and Zhang was only a helper and now falsely claims to be the accounting clerk. Liu Baoshan, the detective in charge, stated that there were accusations of police officers crossing boundaries to make arrests and accepting bribes in Zhang Shoupeng's complaint and must charge Peng with false accusations. Judge Ge ordered the two Chens to be remanded in custody and Zhang and Peng each to pay 500 yuan in bail pending further investigation.</p>

<p>The worker Yu Henian of the Peilin Egg Factory in Yangshupu was hacked to death at the factory gate at 5:05 AM the day before yesterday by Yang Mingde and other workers from the same factory who gathered gangsters. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Guo Huaipu, the prosecutor of the Special District Court, arrived at the scene of the autopsy to examine the body. According to the witness Ye Jicai, the deceased went to A'hai's house to gamble and lost more than ten yuan. He was very unhappy and took away the dice used for gambling, which caused a rift with Yang Mingde and others, who were A'hai's companions. He was not present at the scene and could not say whether Yang was the murderer. Moreover, Yu A'long, the father of the deceased, claimed that his son had been brutally killed and demanded justice. Mr. Guo, after obtaining the confession, stated that the deceased Yu Henian had indeed been hacked to death by Yang Mingde and others with an axe before his death. He ordered the police to arrest the murderer and bring him to justice. The body was to be collected by the father of the deceased.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at approximately 9:10 AM, near the second bridge in the vicinity of the Rihui Port Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, an elderly woman, appearing to be about fifty years old and of Jiangbei origin, was walking on the bridge. The fourth express train from the South Station to Hangzhou approached, and in a moment of panic, the woman was unable to avoid it, causing her to fall into the river and drown. The station police immediately went to the rescue, recovered the body, and informed the local bailiff to report to the local court for an inquest. They also sought out the deceased's relatives to come to the station to identify the body, prepare a coffin, and arrange for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Robbery at a Cloth Firm <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Tongan Factory Cloth Firm, located at No. 2 Tongan Lane, Limalu Road in the South City, is a joint venture of the six major cloth businesses in the South City, specializing in collecting cloth from various factories and distributing it to the member businesses for sale. The business is quite large. Consequently, from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily, various factories gather to deliver goods, with quantities exceeding thousands of bolts, and expenditures amounting to thousands of dollars. The accountant position is rotated daily among the member businesses. Yesterday afternoon, at around 3:00 PM, while the firm was busy with business, four robbers suddenly appeared. One was wearing a navy blue serge long gown, and the other three robbers wore white and blue striped short shirts and trousers, and a yellow Zhongshan suit, respectively. They all spoke with a northern accent. After entering the gate, each robber drew a pistol from their chest and drove the more than twenty accountants, partners, and factory friends into a corner, forbidding them from making a sound. One of the robbers wearing a long gown guarded the front door, while one wearing a Zhongshan suit guarded the back door. The remaining two robbers entered the accounting room, opened the drawer containing silver dollars on the accounting table, and took all the $3,298 in banknotes and silver dollars (mostly from the China Industrial Bank), as well as 129 small silver coins. After taking the loot, they calmly left. The two robbers guarding the front and back doors, seeing that their goal had been achieved, also left one after another, closing the door and fleeing without a trace. According to the firm, the two robbers who seized the cash first pulled out the drawer containing the money, and after taking the banknotes and silver dollars, left without touching other places. Their actions suggest that they were quite familiar with the firm's internal affairs.</p>

Among them, 26 patients with stage III pulmonary tuberculosis underwent artificial pneumothorax surgery to collapse the cavities. Except for those with complications such as laryngeal tuberculosis or intestinal tuberculosis, most turned from danger to safety, with extremely good results. The sanatorium hopes that hospitals in the interior will adopt this method to eradicate the disease. It is reported that relatives of Zhou Yiwen of the Ministry of Railways and Lin Xiang, President of the Supreme Court, have recently undergone surgery at the sanatorium and are about to be discharged.</p>

<p>On March 24th, Huang Zhenrong, a patrolman from the First District Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, apprehended a case of smuggling opium at the 16th Pier. Subsequently, the First District Police Station transferred the opium smuggler Qian Degen and three sacks of opium to the local court for prosecution. Later, Huang Zhenrong testified in court that the person he arrested was a car driver, not Qian Degen, who resembled a vagrant. He also claimed that there was a car used to transport the opium and that there were five sacks of opium. He accused his patrol officer Wang Wencai of accepting a large bribe to release the suspect, substituting a vagrant, and embezzling the opium. At the time, Officer Wang was summoned for questioning, stating that Huang Zhenrong harbored resentment for being transferred to the Sixth District and was slandering him. After review by the Public Trial Court, it was determined that the evidence was insufficient for the time being, and if Wang Wencai had indeed engaged in illegal behavior, the prosecutor should investigate. Therefore, the Criminal Court first concluded part of the Qian Degen case without issuing a verdict. However, after the Qian Degen case was concluded, Huang Zhenrong filed a complaint with the prosecutor's office, accusing Wang Wencai of malfeasance and embezzlement. After the court approved the complaint, it ordered Huang Zhenrong to surrender himself for questioning and verification. Yesterday afternoon, after reading the approval, Huang Zhenrong surrendered himself to the prosecutor's office. Prosecutor Yang opened the court for preliminary examination and ordered him to be dismissed pending verification.</p>

<p>The forecast from the Xujiahui Observatory at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that there are southeast seasonal winds over the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea, with southerly winds to the north, and gentle, undirected winds and fog along the southern coast. The local weather is cloudy with showers. Also, in the four hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 83.1 degrees and the lowest was 68.7 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 83.7 degrees and the lowest was 70.7 degrees. Letter received.</p>
<p>Regarding the news item published in the museum on the 3rd of this month concerning the presentation of the color industry contract, lawyer Mu Ansu wrote yesterday, stating that, according to the party involved, Lihe Foreign Firm, Judge Yang of the Civil Court of the local court, at the request of lawyer Ma Shangjie, instructed the Color Association to come forward to mediate, which is inconsistent with the facts. The case should be negotiated by Ma Shangjie and Lihe Foreign Firm, and the Color Association has no right to intervene. Moreover, the Color Association should not arbitrarily comment on cases that have not been decided by the court. Lihe Foreign Firm said so. It is specially translated and recorded to correct it. The women's work in Huangyan, Zhejiang has always been dominated by weaving white cloth, straw mats, towels, and cotton socks, followed by drawing lamp cores and pasting light fans. However, the income from the above items is meager. Last year, because the wage for weaving foreign straw hats was higher, those who were quick could earn 30 cents a day. Therefore, they heard the news and rushed to abandon their old jobs and learn to weave foreign straw hats. It is said that the daily average export volume from Haimen can reach 10,000 yuan. The county's rice was eaten by insects last year, followed by the great wind and water of the seventh month of the lunar calendar, and the upper and lower seasons were almost barren. All the general farm women rely on the income from this work to fill their stomachs, otherwise, relying solely on the government's funds and local rich people's efforts to open water wheels will be of no avail, and they will inevitably die in the gullies.

<p>Dou Jun, Mr. Li Xiehe (Liejun) of Jiangxi is a founding hero of the party-state. Since leaving Beijing in the 17th year of the Republic of China and returning to Jiangxi, he has been living in seclusion in his hometown of Wuning, devoting himself to the forests and springs and forgetting about fame and wealth. If asked about party-state affairs, he would smile and talk about other things. Since the summer heat has gradually intensified, Mr. Li went to Lushan to escape the heat a month ago. Lushan is a famous mountain since ancient times. Mr. Li sojourns there, composing poems from time to time. Mr. Chen Sanli, the elder San Yuan of Yining, also came to the mountain to escape the heat. Mr. Li regarded the elder as the greatest poet of the time, treating him with the utmost hospitality and showing him the old poems he had written on a boat in the river. The elder followed the rhyme to reciprocate, and his poem is as follows: (At first, I suspected that I had arrived in Shizhou, and the shade of the pines was deep and the bamboos were tall. I tried my best to collect the soaring energy of Qianmo and connected it to the wandering of Lu Ao. Looking back at my hometown, it has become a den of thieves, so I peacefully live in the springs and rocks. The setting sun is in the clouds on the path, appearing and disappearing like an unmoored boat.) It is indeed a great event that the founding hero of the party-state and the poet of the time composed poems in a famous mountain. Mr. Li's poems have been published in various newspapers, so they are not recorded here. It is also heard that the mountain monk Master Dazhi, who is noble in virtue and proficient in Sanskrit, is also revered by the two gentlemen.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Record of a New Robbery Case in Hangzhou, Zhu Jun <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Robbery cases have been frequently heard in Hangzhou this month. First, a nunnery outside Wulin Gate was robbed of money by drugging. Then, the Hengda Tobacco Shop was robbed of money and people were killed. Fortunately, the authorities made every effort to investigate and cracked the case soon. Unexpectedly, a similar drugging robbery case occurred at Anji Temple on Jianqiao Bridge a few days ago. It is not unique but exactly the the same. It is really noteworthy that two people were victimized, one died and one fell ill. The details are recorded as follows: The Location and Current Situation of the Temple Jianqiao Street is the center of the city. There is a constant flow of traffic. Shops are adjacent to the road from the city station to the new market. The temple is located in Zhangjiaqiao on the street, and a monk and a Taoist priest live there to preside over the temple. There are two temple keepers, one named Jiang Jucai and the other named Ma Fulin, who are both law-abiding. Recently, a man from Xiaoshan named A Fu, who is 80 years old, came to the temple to stay temporarily. He is well known by the monk. The monk and the temple keepers have some savings from chanting scriptures, which has aroused the covetousness of bandits. The Circumstances of the Robbery On the evening of the 4th, the presiding monk and the temple keeper Ma went out to chant scriptures and only left the temple keeper Jiang and the old man. At about 8:00 PM, there was a loud knock on the door, claiming to be someone who had come to order scriptures. When the door was opened, four men in short clothes rushed in. They asked for two teacups and took out something similar to shortbread from their chests. They mixed it with boiling water and forced the two men to drink it. The people who came also held rosary beads and claimed that this was vegetarian food and told them to drink it with peace of mind. Leftover Poems of Noble Women</p>

<p>The high moral character of the elders cannot be climbed. The good culture and art are beyond the human world. I regret that my son has not established himself in Chengmen. My nieces and sisters are like jade bamboo. Jade-like words, dusting the whisk, accepting the gift of poetic embellishment, which is more than constant. It is difficult to talk about literature and enriching the country. I am ashamed of being unable to compare with Xiangru in the classics. In the past years, I have enjoyed nurturing talents. I have diligently planted peaches and plums with my own hands. The spring breeze is the same for children and adults. The heavens should not endow them with fewer skirts. Why don't you marry for ten years and remain chaste? The screen is full of white-haired parents. In ancient times, there was only one encounter. Who else can surround the jade ring in Beigong? Soon the two men fell unconscious one after another. The bandits used the plan to search the boxes and cabinets and robbed them of more than 200 yuan. Then they opened the back door and left calmly. The Overview of the Aftermath When the presiding monk Dao Ming and others returned to the temple in the middle of the night, they knocked for a long time without a response. They knew that something was wrong and broke in. They saw Jiang and the other two lying stiff on the ground. They called out to them but they did not wake up. They immediately reported to the police station and sent them to the Municipal Hospital for treatment. However, the old man Lai was already old and the treatment was ineffective. He died. Jiang was mentally disturbed and unable to speak. Then the local court entrusted the body of the deceased Lai to the Medical School to perform an autopsy to determine what kind of poison he had taken. A Glimpse During the Autopsy The autopsy was performed by Yang Shida, a forensic doctor from the local court. Many teachers and students from the school attended the scene. The deceased was obese and his face was life-like. There was still black liquid in his mouth. The stomach was swollen and abnormally full of the same black liquid. It was urgently preserved for chemical testing. There were no ulcers in the mouth, esophagus, or stomach wall. The heart was slightly hypertrophied with fatty degeneration. There were no other major changes. After the autopsy, the family members collected the body for burial. At that time, I inquired about Yang's forensic doctor's opinion. Based on visual observation, he generally knew what kind of poison it was. He replied that it was mostly sleeping pills. It is heard that the murderer has not yet been apprehended. It is thought that under strict investigation, he will not escape the law.</p>
<h3 id="e171">New Thoughts on Seedling Pulling, Autumn Water <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>As the weather has been getting hotter recently, when we are in the office every day, we often take off our coats and hang them on the hooks on the wall or place them randomly on the corners of chairs and tables. It can also be said that valuable items are often placed in the pockets of our coats. We sit in the office and never worry about theft within sight. The weather is getting hotter and more people are going to the office without their coats. I don’t know that a group of poor and idle people have actually seen through our habits and implemented their novel seedling pulling techniques. I quickly recorded it to punish the traitors. It is said that this kind of seedling pulling was invented by two White Russians. There have been two incidents to date to prove it. One of them was in a certain foreign firm at No. 21 Yuanmingyuan Road. At around 9:00 AM or 10:00 AM on May 30th, two Westerners, neatly dressed and with generous manners, strolled into the office of the foreign firm. One of them took off his hat and saluted the office staff (note that there was only one person working in the office at this time). The clerk saw that they were noble gentlemen and sincerely entertained them, asking what they wanted. One of the people who came asked for the address of a certain foreign firm. The clerk took out a directory of companies to search for it. I don’t know that while the clerk was concentrating on answering and flipping through the directory, the other person who came was using his quick hands. The clerk’s coat happened to be hanging on the hook behind him. The clerk was sitting in the chair facing the person who asked the question and did not pay attention. In a blink of an eye, the banknotes, numbers of coins and diary were already in the bag of the visitor, and the clerk did not know it. The person asking the question saw that it was done and then said goodbye and left together. The clerk did not know that this uninvited guest was a thief until after get off work. The other was at No. 17 Bowuyuan Road, also a Western foreign firm. The incident was very similar and was probably done by the same gang. Only after entering the room, the conversation was slightly different. It can be seen from the above two incidents that these thieves must be neatly dressed so that people will not be suspicious. The place where they operate must be a place where foreign firms and companies gather, hoping that what they get will be plentiful. The office they visit must be a place where there are very few clerks and where there are clothes hanging on the corners of the wall so that their purpose can be easily achieved without wasting their time. I hope that the readers of the newspaper will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Special Ways of Eating Chicken, Di Weng <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Chicken is a delicacy among foods. Unfortunately, ordinary cooking often results in half of the flavor being lost in the soup, and the chicken meat cannot have a particularly good taste. Since last winter, I have been invited to dine by friends and have eaten special foods twice, both of which were chicken. Now I will explain in detail the method of preparing these foods. Although they are not mountain and sea delicacies, they are different from ordinary foods. Air-Dried Chicken with Feathers Kill a young hen weighing two or three pounds, remove its stomach and fill it with salt. Do not remove the feathers and do not put it in water. Use salt on the outside and rub it against the direction of the feathers. After rubbing the salt, hang it in a ventilated place for a month before it can be eaten. When eating, first remove the feathers and then boil water to the boiling point. Then put the chicken in the boiling water and cover the pot. Do not add more fire. After half an hour, take the chicken out and boil the water again until it boils as before. Put the chicken back into the pot and take it out again after half an hour to eat it. The chicken is tender and delicious, and the taste is very different from ordinary chicken. However, this method is suitable for winter. In spring, when the weather is warm, it is easy to spoil. Mud Chicken Also use a young hen weighing two or three pounds. Kill it, remove its stomach, and also do not remove the feathers. Pour salt, wine, soy sauce, and other seasonings into the chicken belly and sew the mouth with thread. Cover it completely with muddy mud, then wrap it with wet grass paper and pile it up with rice husks and burn it with a slow fire for about four hours. When the mud is dry, the chicken is cooked. Throw the chicken away and the feathers will fall off with the mud. The taste is very usable. Wrapping it with wet grass paper can remove the smoky smell. Both methods preserve the true flavor. The latter method is dry-smoked, and although the former method puts it into boiling water, it does not continue to boil, so the true flavor does not escape. It can be used to accompany wine to remove special delicacies.</p>

<p>Chapter Twelve: Farewell Banquet and Leaving Feast, Picking Flowers to Keep Beautiful Shadows, Famous Garden Party, Tasting Tea to See Beautiful Faces. It is said that Ruiyun's wedding date is approaching. Her stepmother, the eldest aunt, has been coaxing her these days like coaxing a child. She is simply saying how good the Zhang family is, how all these things are your good fortune, no one can take it away from you. Now, which of the sisters doesn't envy you? She also said that when you go out, I will also make you some beautiful clothes. I have already made you a pink embroidered padded jacket and a pink embroidered skirt. You have never worn a skirt in your life. This is also the first time. It is also your good fortune to wear a red skirt for the first time. You must know that in the large mansion, you are not allowed to wear a red skirt as a concubine. You can only wear colored skirts unless you have a son. Only when the young master is getting married can his biological mother come out to pay her respects before she can wear a red skirt, and she must also get the consent of the wife and the permission of the master. Now I tell Young Master Zhang that he says whatever you want, anyway, I don't have a wife. If the old lady knows about it, she won't agree. It's good to keep it from her. Do you think how generous and lucky he is? Although the pink skirt is a little worse than wearing a bright red skirt, what about the new-style free marriage nowadays? You have also seen people formally getting married in civilized dramas, and the bride is also wearing that set of clothes. I made this set of brightly colored clothes for you, which also cost dozens of yuan. In fact, she was reluctant to pay for it herself. She received all 5,000 yuan and was unwilling to lose any money to make clothes for her. She cleverly requested Zhang's family to pay another sum of money. She said that now that the person is your person, even making clothes is what your people wear and is what you should do. It is also your face to wear some beautiful clothes when you go to your mansion. Since Young Master Zhang likes Ruiyun, how can he refuse? The Zhang family was originally a large family in Wujun and treated people kindly, which is not like some official families who have certain rules for taking concubines. It is said that at that time, there was a master who was also a very high official, but he had a lot of internal pets and more than a dozen concubines. Although he had so many concubines, he still wanted to prostitute. Fortunately, there are prostitutes everywhere in China. In Beijing and Tianjin, they call it "going to the kiln," and in Shanghai and Suzhou, they call it "going to the brothel." This master is very happy and doesn't put on airs when he goes to the brothel. He has the best temper and is the first to be confused.

<h3 id="e174">Gold Market: Rapid Ups and Downs <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Gold Exchange Restricts Transaction Volume: Each firm is limited to 1,000 bars. Spot goods are plentiful, and bulls are selling off. Yesterday's gold price fluctuations were erratic and unpredictable. The morning market felt quite brisk, once exceeding the 580 tael mark. The afternoon market suddenly turned downward, plummeting below the 70 tael level. The gold market was volatile, with daily price swings of twelve to thirteen taels. However, foreign exchange rates were tightening, and the internal market appeared firm. Banks had an appetite for gold. Transactions by brokers were not substantial. The exchange collectively believed that foreign exchange fluctuations had caused excessive gold price volatility. To prevent risks, starting from the 16th of this month, the daily trading and settlement balance for the August gold price for each firm would be limited to slightly over 1,000 bars. Yesterday, Zhiyongfeng, Yuanxingyong, Yu Da, Wanxing, and Shunli sold gold in large quantities, while small buyers also participated. The morning market started high, and after the foreign exchange rate rose both internally and externally, the price climbed to 81.8 taels. Subsequently, due to firms rushing to sell and people fearing a sharp decline, the price dropped by seven or eight taels. In the afternoon market, there were even more sellers, including Yuancheng, Yuanchengyong, and Tianyuyong. Spot goods were plentiful, and with the settlement date approaching, bulls were eager to sell, causing the price to plummet to below 70 taels. Exchange rates also appeared to ease, eventually settling at slightly over 69 taels. Silver prices contracted again. The opening price immediately jumped by 5 taels 9 qian, and large bars dropped by another 16.7%. The silver price fell by 1.375. The July gold price opened at 577 taels 5 qian, an increase of 5 taels 9 qian. The gross margin fell from 78 taels 5 qian to 74 taels, as large firms continued to sell. Subsequently, there were fluctuations of one or two taels. As exchange rates tightened, Zhejiang offered October British gold at 7 pence, and Sumitomo offered August at the same price. Citibank offered September at 37.8125 yuan, causing the gold price to fall. When the first announcement was made, the price rebounded by over one tael to 76 taels 2 qian. The US dollar tightened to 75, a decrease of 1.625 yuan. Gold prices increased by 5.25 points. The gold price continued to be suppressed, but due to internal tightening, it also rose, climbing by four or five taels. At 10:30, it reached 81 taels 8 qian. In September, Sanjing and Dehua mutually traded at 6 pence 8125. In June, Anda and Maccali mutually traded at 5625. Market sentiment was greatly boosted, but sellers were still reluctant, making it difficult to sustain the price. It then plummeted by over eight taels to 73 taels 5 qian at 11:45. At noon, it rebounded by four taels, closing at 77 taels. The afternoon market suddenly declined, with the closing price decreasing by 2 taels 4 qian. The afternoon market opened at 76 taels 5 qian. After fluctuating by one tael, small buyers advanced by 2.5 points, reaching 77 taels 9 qian. The price immediately dropped by two or three taels to slightly over 74 taels, as sellers were relentless. Then, it rose again by two or three points. Suddenly, the atmosphere turned negative. Foreign exchange telegraphs weakened, and the Shanghai market also saw easing in British, American, and Japanese exchange rates. People became anxious, and Yuancheng and others actively entered the market. Overall, the excessive amount of cash and the strict export ban were the causes. As for the September Citibank deal, Sanjing sold at 37.8125 yuan. The near-term British gold was at 6 pence 625, and Japanese gold was at 1 tael 3 qian 05. It suddenly plunged by 7 taels 4 points, breaking the 70 tael mark. It then rebounded by only five or six qian. However, at 4:30, the closing price was still only 569 taels 2 qian, a decrease of 2 taels 4 qian compared to the previous day. The maximum price during the day was 81 taels 8 qian, and the minimum price was 69 taels, a difference of 12 taels 8 qian. The disclosed price was changed to 636 taels 6, a decrease of over 60 taels. Registered at 77 taels, replenishing water at 77 taels. Afternoon at 69 taels. Morning opening at 76 taels 5. Noon closing at 6 taels 5. Afternoon 6 taels 2 qian. Closing market at 68 taels 5 qian. Closing 6 taels 5. Afternoon 6 taels 2 qian. Closing market at 68 taels 5 qian. All firms had no substantial transactions. Among the inter-dealer transactions, Zhiyongfeng, Yu Da, Wanxing, Shunli, Changshengyong, Yuanmaoyong, Yu Yuyong, Yuanxingyong, and others sold gold. Fuchang, Fuyu, and Xiangyu bought gold. Hengxing, Yuantai, and Taixing had occasional transactions. In the afternoon, Yuancheng, Yuanchengyong, Yu Da, Tianyuyong, Hengxing, Fuchang, Zhiyongfeng, and others mostly sold gold. Taifengcheng, Shunli, and Shunmao made slight advances. Firms' entries and exits were uncertain, but no substantial transactions were made to avoid risks. The Guangdong group sold a lot, about 1,600 bars. The Dalian group sold a total of about 1,700 bars and bought about 900 bars.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Foreign Exchange Market: Tense Atmosphere <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Silver Market Declines, Exchange Rates Tighten for Three Consecutive Sessions: Although the internal market is firm, it shows slight weakness in comparison. Yesterday, HSBC foreign exchange rates tightened in three sessions due to the decline in British, American, and silver markets. British gold tightened by 75, to 1 shilling 6 pence. American gold tightened by 1.625 yuan, to 37.375 yuan. Indian currency decreased by 4.25 yuan, to 103 rupees 75. German currency decreased by 6 yuan, to 157 marks. The exchange rate decreased by 38 yuan, to 954 Dutch guilders decreased by 3.75 yuan, to 93 guilders. French currency increased by 6 taels, to 150 taels 5 taels. Japanese gold increased by 5.25 points, reaching 1 tael 3 qian 2 fen. Hong Kong dollars remained unchanged, still at 82 taels. Internally, banks also trended towards tightness, but with occasional fluctuations. Ultimately, they remained tight. However, compared to the official exchange rates, the trend was easing. When compared to the gold price, the hedging spread was still quite far from the previous day, about 60 taels. Chinese merchants who hedged suffered significant losses. The gold price rose and fell sharply, with a swing of twelve to thirteen taels, making it difficult to predict. However, large firms were selling off, and most dealers were pessimistic. This was due to the exchange restricting the number of transactions. As for Chinese foreign exchange merchants, they were generally hedging gold. British gold transactions amounted to 300,000 pounds, resulting in a net inflow of 200,000 pounds. Zhejiang, Shiye, Sanjing, Sumitomo, Maccali, and Meifeng sold gold. Zhengjin and Sumitomo made slight advances. The banks also made transactions of 40,000 to 50,000 pounds with each other, and Citibank transacted with 100,000 yuan. Chinese merchants sold 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Shiye, Sanjing, and Sumitomo acquired gold. Sanjing sold 100,000 yuan for settlement. As for Japanese gold, the Dalian group sold several hundred thousand yuan. Sanjing and Chosen bought gold, and a small amount was for settlement, sold by Taiwan merchants for future delivery. Compared to the previous day, British gold tightened by 375, American gold tightened by 6875, and Japanese gold increased by 2.5 points. The market atmosphere remained tense. The internal market for British exchange was up 375. The swap spread remained only 0625. The quoted price for the current month was 1 shilling 6 pence 75. July 8125, August 875, September 9375.

July 1 tael 3 qian. August 1 tael 2 qian 9 fen 5. September 1 tael 2 qian 9 fen. The buying price was decreased by half a point. The noon closing price for the current month was 1 tael 3 qian 1 fen.

September 1 tael 2 qian 9 fen. The buying price was still suppressed by half a point. Therefore, hedging was not suitable, and Chinese merchants did not dare to try.</p>
<h3 id="e176">British and American Silver Markets Plunge <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Near-term and Distant Bars Plunge by 4175: American Spot Silver Plunges by 1.375: Yesterday, the London telegram reported a sudden and sharp decline in the price of bars, a reversal after two consecutive days of gains. The near-term price contracted by 4375, to 16 pence 4375. The distant price also contracted by 4375, to 16 pence 25. This was due to speculative selling and a scarcity of buyers. The New York telegram reported an even more severe decline in the price of American silver, decreasing by 125, to 4 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen 6875. American currency to British currency fell by 09375, to 4 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen 75. Japanese currency to American currency remained at 49 yuan 4375.

<h3 id="e177">Foreign Cents Reach New Low Prices <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Starting at 7 qian 1 fen and a half in the morning, silver swaps gradually declined. The market situation has been such that the silver funds released by banks have been sufficient to meet market demand, so the silver market has suddenly eased. Silver swaps have suddenly decreased, and overnight rates have been particularly relaxed. Foreign cents, due to poor sales, have continued to decline, repeatedly reaching new lows not seen this year. This is because there are many banknotes in circulation, and society dislikes the inconvenience of silver dollars, preferring to use banknotes. Therefore, there is no hope for foreign cents to increase in value. The price of cent swaps (foreign cents): In the morning market, people were tired, and the cent price continued to fall slightly to 7 qian 1 fen 5 li, a further drop of 1 li compared to the previous day's morning market, reaching a new low for the year. The noon market rebounded slightly by 3 hao 7 and a half, to 7 qian 1 fen 5 li 7 hao 3 and a half. (Silver Swaps) Since experiencing a rise some days ago, the market is now completely calm, so silver swaps have gradually declined. Yesterday morning, it was 1 qian 8 fen, a decrease of 7 fen compared to the previous morning. The noon market weakened by another 6 fen, to 1 qian 2 fen. The bank's rate was 7 fen, with an overnight rate of only 2 or 3 fen, and even overnight rates. Auxiliary currency market conditions: Jiangnan small dollars were 6 qian 3 fen 2 li in the morning market, an improvement of 3 li compared to the previous day's noon market, with 2,000 jiao traded. In the noon market, there were no transactions, and the market price did not change. Guangdong small dollars were 5 qian 9 fen 3 li and a half in the morning market, and 3 li in the noon market, with a declining trend. Transactions: 95,000 jiao in the morning market, 20,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins remained unchanged at 410 strings.

<h3 id="e180">Yarn Market Under the Cloud of Adverse Conditions <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Multiple Suppressions Make It Difficult to Break the Stalemate: The yarn market remains weak. Both overseas yarn and cotton prices are trending downward. Although exchange rates are tightening, the downward pressure remains severe. Therefore, some large firms continue to sell off in large quantities, and people are somewhat softened. Actual sales are sluggish due to the stagnant situation, and the market is trending downward. However, buyers remain firm due to the high price of raw cotton. Ruida continues to sell, and scattered buyers bid. The opening was mediocre, and Grade 3 fell sharply. Ruida continued to sell, and speculators covered their short positions, causing a rebound of one, two, three, or four qian. In the afternoon, the decline in Grade 3 was severe. Current sales are sluggish and difficult to improve, and morale is declining. Prices for all months fell by two, three, four, five, and seven qian. Throughout the day, Ruida sold a total of 2,700 bales in the morning and afternoon markets, with all purchases made by scattered buyers. Total transactions for the day were 11,150 bales. The closing prices for people's bids are recorded on the left. People's Bid Closing Prices: Month, Price, Change, Account Balance: September, 1592, down 62, 8000; June, 1557, up 1, 20250; October, 1598, 120, 700; July, 1567, 323, 700; November, 1601, 211, 1000; August, 1581, 127, 150.

<p>Exchange Rate Recovers, Gold Market Rises Again: Hankou Sellers Halt Sales, Cotton Market Stabilizes. As exchange rates tightened again, the market atmosphere became quieter, but the situation was still flat and soft. After large quantities were sold off by Hankou sellers, scattered buyers had filled their demand, and the situation had eased, with no immediate surge. However, most people believe that inventory is low and foreign exchange rates are unlikely to ease significantly in the short term, so they still hold high intentions. The situation in the American cotton market remains weak, and the trend in the cotton market is unusually complex. Hankou Bids Rise Sharply, then Rebound Slightly: The Hankou bid market opened in the morning and rose with foreign exchange rates, showing a firm trend. Prices for all months rose by 1.5 qian to 3 qian. In the afternoon, they rebounded slightly by 5 fen. As Hankou sellers did not sell, there were no large transactions in the market. Total transactions for the day were 28,300 dan. The closing prices for Hankou bids are recorded on the left. Hankou Bid Closing Prices: Month, Price, Change, Account Balance: August, 37.70, up 1, 567, 900; June, 36.60, up 1, 553, 100; October, 37.10, 2067, 400; July, 37.15, 1069, 800; November, 36.80, 1055, 100. Current Demand Remains Quiet: The current cotton business has become quiet again. All factories have no demand. The sources for the docks are 700+ bales of Tongzhou cotton and 360 bales of Yao cotton. Sales records are on the left. Yao cotton, 33.8 to 33.6, 300 bales purchased by fellow traders.

<p>Zhabei: The source market sales vary. Beigeng has large-scale exits and entries. The retail sales in the four townships are lively. The supply of high-quality Zhongguan goods is tight. However, recently, foreign rice has become popular. Common people in Dabu are shifting their attention to foreign rice because the price of geng is too high. Therefore, the sales of geng declined and prices frequently decreased last week. In reality, it is difficult to return to small quantities during this transition period. Yesterday afternoon, the market was extremely firm and slightly increased due to people's sentiments. Thin and stable sales, stable prices, and slight changes. The continued sales of Huhang white geng from Subutong were firm. Businessmen were thin, and early gains were not good. All are set on Yangxian Duzixian. Sales in the market are mainly Xigong minor. Yuan Yin Hua is still mediocre.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw rising prices in both the upper and lower markets after opening. The opening price in the front market was very soft. However, manufacturers secretly stopped selling to cover short positions, and new bulls became active again, causing prices to rise sequentially.

<h3 id="e185">Wheat Prices: Old Wheat Rises, New Wheat Flat <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Standard Returns Small: Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a flat and weak trend for all months. This was because the new wheat arrived in abundance, and everyone unanimously returned to small quantities. After this, if the arrival volume increases again, the market may temporarily stabilize. The closing prices were: June, down 2 fen; July, down 1.89 fen; September, down 3 fen; October, down 2 fen; November, down 1 fen. New wheat arrival volume was very high. The volume of old wheat was also high. However, the factory demand for high-quality old wheat was very strong. 7,000 bags of Qingjiangpu Shenwan wheat were opened at a price of 5 taels 3 qian, an increase of 5 fen. 18,000 to 9,000 bags of new wheat arrived, and 10,000 bags were sold. The market was flat. The opening prices were: Lai Kunshan wheat, 4 taels 9 qian 4 fen; Baoshan wheat, 4 taels 8 qian 7 fen; Pudong wheat, 4 taels 7 qian; Puzhen wheat, 4 taels 9 qian; Nanjing wheat, 4 taels 8 qian 2 fen.</p>

<p>Up and Down by One Jiao: Yesterday, the sales of foreign rice were more active. The total market opened with 17,000 to 8,000 bags. The market had a strong appetite, and high-quality goods were particularly sought after. Therefore, high-quality goods immediately rose by one jiao. However, the number of medium and lower-quality goods arriving was too high in recent days. Therefore, lower-quality goods decreased by one jiao. The goods sold in the general market were all purchased by the local market, with only a small number purchased by foreign markets.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silk market in this port seemed to be starting. New factories in New York have wired that the Shanghai Qianli Sanjing and other companies have invited Chinese silk merchants to negotiate. The increase in silk prices is very small. The factory is still short of silk, so it is difficult to reach an agreement. Transactions are waiting for new ones to come. Companies such as Dachang have negotiated, but the selling price is not high, and the owners do not announce it.</p>
<h3 id="e188">New York has a Total of 58,000 Bales of Raw Silk <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Since the summer, the sales of silk fabrics in the New York market have been sluggish. The factory sales of raw silk materials have decreased sharply, mostly being replaced by rayon. Imports of raw silk from various countries have decreased sharply, but the inventory is still high. According to a telegram from the New York Silk Association, New York warehouses have a total of 58,000 bales of raw silk from China, Japan, China, and France, which is sufficient for several months of demand.</p>

<p>Since Russian tea master Wu Ji Luofu arrived in Shanghai, the Chinese tea market has been in a slump. Chinese tea merchants attach great importance to the merchant's attitude. According to Russian sources, since the suspension last year, Russia does not have much tea in stock. The market is reorganizing, but the price of Qimen black tea is too expensive and does not meet sales needs. Zhuangzhen eyebrow Gongxi has considerable needs. The process will be reorganized and opened. However, the firm adheres to the principle of only buying if the price is cheap, and Gongxi with tea seeds are also rejected.</p>

<p>Up 56 Liang from Before: Xinghua Guifei is in Short Supply. Recently, due to the few arrivals, the Jiechun Zheng Er and other brands are extremely scarce. Yesterday, each line of hand goods were sold out. The price is up 56 Liang from before. It is still far from the release of new goods. The late market is preventing more tension. Lu Shangdang Yuan is now slightly looser due to the time limit, with a few cents to one or two fluctuations from the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Sugar Market: Domestic Wufubing Brand Price Increases <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Ice Flower Green Goods are in Short Supply: Yesterday's sugar market news: Cuban current sugar price is 1.4675, down 3125 from the previous telegram; New York futures sugar September 1.44, December 1.54, March next year 1.63, May 1.70, each down two points; Java current sugar price 9.125; July 8.875; August 8.75, each down 125. Although the purchase of coarse sand white from the public association is silent, the foreign exchange rate has recovered, and the output is lacking. The transaction price is 7 Liang and a half. The late market shouted high, but few received it. The market for No. 20 medium sand white is also not weak at 7 Liang 4 Qian. Since the Minghua factory and the Dali factory have opened up the market fiercely in recent days, the market has suddenly weakened, and the price has fallen sharply. Yesterday's market used the Japanese exchange rate to raise the price by 132, so the seller raised the price. The need is still alive. The transaction price rose by 5 fen. Ming</p>

<h3 id="e198">A Conversation with Athletes After Returning from the Greater East Asia Games <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Several individuals were selected as representatives for this year's Far Eastern Games and the Greater East Asia Games, including Cao Yu, Hao Chunde, Zhong Lianji, Feng Yunyou, Dai Linjing, Chen Zhenhe, and Chen Jiaqiu. These representatives returned to the country the day before yesterday and arrived safely at the school. The school authorities inquired about the reasons for the failure this time and their feelings after going to Japan. A brief record is as follows:</p>
<p>It is said that the most heartbreaking thing for our country is football, because football has always been something we were expected to win, like taking something out of a pocket. Unexpectedly, it ended in a tie, which was truly unimaginable. The main reason for the failure is that the talent is unevenly distributed and the lack of practice made it impossible to connect. For example, Uncle Gong (Feng Yunyou's nickname), who is known for his good defense, was transferred to the front line to charge into battle, which was not his strength. Also, the absence of Li Qiuwai also detracted from the team's performance. Although the Japanese are a short nation, their players are not short. Their height has a certain size and a corresponding physique, unlike our country, where it is random. The Japanese can encourage hard work, so they have made such amazing progress, which our people cannot match. The unfairness of the refereeing is also a major reason. As for the failures in other aspects such as track and field and basketball, on the one hand, there is a lack of practice, and on the other hand, some people participate in too many events and do not have the energy, resulting in nothing being achieved.</p>
<p>As for those who asked the athletes for autographs, they were overwhelmed. Not only did they want Chinese autographs, but also English ones. Some athletes were good at Chinese autographs, and some were good at English ones, but it was rare to find someone who could do both well. On the one hand, this shows the enthusiasm and curiosity of the Japanese people for sports.</p>
<p>When asked why Ms. Sun Guiyun of the健而美 team was not selected, it was said that she was too impatient and did not understand the language, which was the cause of her problem. She was disqualified only on the fourth time she violated the rules, and the judges had already given her a chance. Finally, the athletes said that they deeply understood that this failure is the mother of success. As the saying goes (Don't get angry, just remember). If the people of the country work hard and practice more, and at the same time, the government, schools, and the public strongly promote it, the future four years will be different from today. Although the statements are ordinary, they are enough to inspire the will of young people, so I have made a special record of them. (An) Yang Zeheng.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Ms. Yang Heng Won the Women's Tennis Championship at the Education College of Jinan University This Year <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>The first teachers and students' joint sports meeting of the Education College of Jinan University ended the week before last. The meeting included tennis, basketball, football, volleyball, and track and field competitions. Tennis was divided into men's and women's groups, while the rest were mixed. Ms. Yang Heng, who won the women's singles tennis championship this year, also represented the school last year in the Mandarin speech competition for all universities in Shanghai and the four universities in Jiangnan and won both first prizes. It is reported that Ms. Yang's health has been poor since returning to the country, and she has felt very weak. Therefore, she gave up her specialty of speech (it is a pity that Jinan University lost this competition because Ms. Yang was weak and did not participate) and engaged in physical education. She practices on the tennis court every morning and has achieved great results. According to those close to Ms. Yang, her health has gradually recovered and her complexion has improved since she paid attention to exercise. We hope that Ms. Yang will practice more and become not only an educator, speaker, and playwright, but also a physical education expert. (An)</p>
<h3 id="e200">Professor's Utensil <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Bland, a professor at Aurora University, is usually very popular with students. During the school's fifth-anniversary celebration, she trained some male and female students in the university to perform English plays and dances. During the training period, she was very satisfied and confident that she would not fail.</p>
<p>But on the night of the performance of the English play, the audience suddenly made a strange noise and started shouting one after another. Not only were the performers flustered, but the director was also anxious. At first, she thought the actors had made a mistake, but after careful observation, there were no mistakes at all.</p>
<p>When the dance was performed, the audience made the same strange noise. This time, she was extremely angry and returned to the dormitory where she cried to the female students, saying, "I have directed students to perform plays many times, and I have never been subjected to such stimulation. And especially in a high-level and rigorous academic institution!" After saying that, she kept crying for two nights. The female students who were trained by her had worked hard for almost a month, and not only did they not receive praise, but they also added a lot of cold ridicule from the students. They couldn't help but shed tears of sympathy with Ms. Bland. (Bi)</p>
