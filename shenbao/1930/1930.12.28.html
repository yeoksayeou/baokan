<p>時評</p>
<h3>世界之所以多事</h3>
<p>世界之所以維繫於不敝者。不外貨物現金人工三者而已。貨賴商以銷。賴工以製。賴金以賣買。而人又賴貨之暢銷以得工作。金又賴工商之運用以資流通。三者失其平均。而世界遂以多事矣。　　試觀今日之國外各消息。有一不爲此三者而擾擾乎。印度古巴與德國間糖産限制之糾紛。南洋錫礦産額限制之爭執。皆爲貨多不銷之故也。貨多不銷。則工將停。金將匱。而恐慌起矣。美國中央儲備金處報告。謂十二月分工業製品。仍見低落。失業仍增多。經濟之凋敝。仍未能稍紓。是工因貨之不銷而停滯。人工停滯。則失業之恐慌。愈無辦法矣。又美國政府財政專家聲稱。法國囤積美金二萬萬元。亦祇僅佔全世界金供給五分之。一且産金各國。時時放出存金。故不足危及金本位之國。然而金貴潮流如此。原因雖非盡由於囤積。而現金之缺乏。則已顯著。金價愈貴。銀價愈賤。而商與工俱受影響。恐金本位國。亦未見其益也。蘇俄於此。思所以打破此不平均之難關而獨行抛貨賤售之策。以冀工可不停。金可吸收。故在此各國商務皆感低跌之時。而蘇俄在英美之商務。皆以激增報告。是果其策之小效歟。然而大勢所趨。恐非此種簡單之小策所能有效。結果僅增一時之奮興。而獲紛擾之果而已。</p>

<p>綫中日各得一半、在青島之一端、由中國運用之、其在佐世保一端、則由日本運用之等字語、至該海綫在青島一端之運用事宜、我國以應日本之要求、中國政府於大東大北公司所有之電信特許權獨占期滿後、不得繼續、故在前項電信特許權未取銷以前、暫委日本代辦、即今之青佐水綫運用處是也、（現青島電報局設有運用處）惟關於財政收發及投送電報等事宜、概歸青島電報局辦理、至關於運用處一切辦法、由中日兩國派員協定、迨十三年底、始行議决、即所謂青佐水綫合同是也、至十四年二月一日起始、在青島一端之水線、由我國接收、開始通信、</p>

<p>（四）報費查青佐水綫、每月收入報費、約有二萬餘元之譜、外綫費實居大半、計每月須給與日本、但在張宗昌時代、電政當局截留支取、故積欠最多、然日本方面、亦有欠繳我國者、但爲數不多、迨濟案解决、國民政府設立山東電政管理局後、該局以此線關係國際、爲中外所屬目、亟應設法收回、故每月籌欵給付約一萬元、現時祗欠三萬餘元而已、</p>
<p>（五）收回日人之侵略山東、一欲以扶助其遼東半島之帝國主義、二欲得山東沿海半島、以鞏固其日本海之海防、三欲以達其滅我中國之迷夢、故於交通之設備、亟欲得一權利、以展施其帝國主義之目的、吾人爲革命黨、又爲國民之公役、於</p>
<p>責職上不得不急起直追、設法從速收回、以固吾圉、除於十七十八十九年每月備欵給還積欠外、現已籌足欵項、由交通部與日使交涉、定於明年一月一日收回、至水綫處所用之機器、及設備之各物、均係　自日人、我國現旣未有購置、即擬向日人一併購置、並擬於山東電政管理局增設國際電信課、派員專管青佐及烟大（烟至大連）之國際通信、以昭愼重、（二十四日）</p>

<h3>眞茹和英海軍</h3>
<p>二與二之比</p>
<p>昨日甲組賽</p>
<p>丨童榮文立二功造成和局丨</p>
<p>眞茹足球隊昨日下午又與英海軍作甲組之賽於申園足球塲、初羣以爲眞茹必佔優勝、結果則成和局、一爲二比二之比、述其原因及略况如左、</p>
<p>眞茹陣勢不同</p>
<p>眞茹連日大戰、將不勝其勞、初則高級盃、再而甲組賽、今日又將出馬戰强敵、接連三日、不可不稍蓄精銳、而交替休息昨日莊世鴻林松發二前街未未出塲、易以梁樹棠楊保森、梁未出色、楊且不佳、致稍失聯絡、羅海光則更爲童榮文、故上半時眞茹極不得意、下半時陳家球與楊保森互易聲勢一振、雖然、眞如正在鍛煉時期、未曾失敗、已可貴矣、其陣線如下、</p>
<p>梁官濂馮運佑江善敬梁樹棠陳鎭和陳保森</p>
<p>陳秉祥童榮文載麟經陳家球陳洪寳</p>
<p>海軍昨日振起</p>
<p>眞茹陣勢更動、而海軍則昨日突然振起、去盡前日萎靡之氣此亦爲和局一因、海門守門、殊能鎭靜、史密斯之左衛亦佳、而中堅中鋒又甚出色、是故能予眞茹以强烈之抗禦、卒成平手也、其陣線僅更動右翼、如後、</p>
<p>海門史密斯考克斯愛許門勞勃生亨斯敦</p>
<p>高爾克勞福惠愛脫勒許美耶爾</p>
<p>不勝則遭挫折</p>
<p>華登任裁判、鳴笛開球海軍先攻、往來攻守、無一成就、陳秉祥左方深入、孤軍力薄、廢然而返、童榮文前進、阻於敵衛、戴麟經進、陳鎭和追上攻打、又爲球門接住、梅洪寳之角球、亦然無敵、屢攻不破、似爲和局先兆、而海軍亦頻頻進攻、倍受其累、險象層出、不一而足、無不爲眞茹慮、果然不勝則敗、敵得角球、自右而左、一回顧、左翼高爾躍起頭頂、竟爲之中、眞茹乃先敗、離開賽二十五分點、眞茹反攻、圍打三四次、仍不得志、離休息時間僅三分鐘、賜患又來、敵左翼傳送至中鋒、再至右邊、右内鋒隊長勒許斜球踼去、梁小爲出界、豈意徵觸門木、擦彈進去矣、眞茹不幸、遂負二球、</p>
<p>頭頂挽回一球</p>
<p>休息將至、衆大失望、天不願眞茹敗、第二球入後、不逾一分鐘、眞茹得機大進、戴中鋒一傳至容提　　洪寳、梅起一脚、恰落門前、童榮文抬　一頂、果然挽回一半、休息時間　至、上半時於是爲一比二、</p>
<p>再進造成平手</p>
<p>下半時起敵仍攻打猛烈、駭浪時時起現、幸未失事、陳家球脚有徴傷、乃與揚何森易位、聲勢較佳、守衛亦較得力、盡力反攻時、一次童榮文得傳來之球、已至門前、可以自打、一慌亂再傳至右、以致不入可惜、時過五分鐘、三軍齊進、全師用命、矢志破敵、陳秉祥主踢角球、落點甚佳、羣皆角逐門前、童榮文靜眼以觀、乘敵軍正亂、一脚攻入網去、遂成平手、此童之第二功也、</p>
<p>猛攻不下奈何</p>
<p>和局旣成頓生希望、以冀勝歸、此後四十分鐘、眞茹出全力進取、屢破敵關、皆止於門前而返、有一時五人齊進至門前、敵陣空虚、攻去竟爲接任不進、陳鎭和猛攻、亦落門外、若是者累累、不禁爲眞茹可惜、終局時局隊仍各得二球、</p>
<p>丨夏光努力勝强敵</p>
<p>夏光　隊、在乙組一中、同居領袖地位、蓋均以長勝軍自鳴者也、昨晚之戰、有關亽乙組一之首席榮譽、作戰之烈、不言可喻、雙方實力、夏光確較優美、故在全局中、無往不占先着、惜全隊陣線、少有變化、恂爲美中不足耳、結果二十七比二十、</p>

<h3>談如醉如狂之乒乓運動王沿津</h3>
<p>予讀自由談六年未嘗一日間。談網球足球之稿件屢見矣。然罕覯談乒乓者。而近日滬上乒乒運動。　起雲湧。盛極一時不　讀書之暇。亦樂此不疲。敢將見聞所及。經騐所得拉雜記之。望海内乒乒家有以敎我。</p>
<p>乒乓運動之歷史乒乓運動。發明於英格蘭據我師梅益盛先生MASON言。乒乒之發明在一千八百八十七年係由網球之原理。推演而成當時不過盛行於倫敦其後漸次普及全國由英而法而德而遍全歐矣。其能在歐洲成爲普遍之運動。於美國之成績若何。自不待言。而不知我東方民族。亦所好焉酷嗜之深可在日本窺見。每年有數百團體。羣爭獎杯且公園旅社。皆有此項設備以供民衆演習。我上海者初僅見之於各學校。及青年會儉德會等團體今者各工會家庭均有此項運動矣。將來之發展寗有限量耶。　　乒乓運動之利益網球足球之運動。宜於體格强健之人。而乒乓則不限於强弱男女老幼無所不宜。且乒乓係室内運動天雖下雨降雪亦可照常運動。無妨於事。蓋人之運動貴在日行不間。乒</p>
<h3>羅漢無靈逐逝波厂</h3>
<p>吾鎭（平陶）之眞靜寺。爲全國僧界三養老院之一。規模宏大。頭陀衆多。有某僧者。饒於資。擬獨力爲寺中雕塑尺高之羅漢五百尊。迺於今夏購辦上等木材雇工雕刻。但雕工雇有甲乙二班。每班各雕半數。甫開工。僧即往游普陀。日前始歸。而兩班雕工均已竣事。惟甲班技術不精。致所雕之二百五十尊羅漢。頗爲　劣。因之該僧見而不悅。對甲班工頭頗多指摘。該工頭性躁氣盛。受責後。即將自雕之木偶。悉數抛入寺前之苕溪中。一時溪中浮者沉者。横者豎者。均系尊者。大有斷流之概。謔者謂若輩羅漢。上天無路。入海有門。又謂其數適爲二百五。宜其無靈而遭滅頂也當諸羅漢投水之際。寺中一般僧侣。羣至溪畔。或屈膝跪送。或和南誦經。或鼓掌狂笑。或仰面太息。五光十色。煞是可觀。最可笑者。諸尊者順流而下。沿溪居民見而訝異。於是疑神疑鬼。發生種種謠傳云。</p>
<p>乓可以如此願綜乒乓之利益不獨能流動血液增進生機即於智能上。心理上。無形中亦蒙莫大之利益。斯則在身臨其境者方能領悟得之</p>
<p>乒乓運動之一得予之開始乒乓運動。在十年以前惜中途以環境關係。屢行屢輟迄今毫無成就去冬與中國公學徐守堅君發起組織城星乒乓隊於寳山城西公園。一載以來成績尙佳並由我隊竭力宣傳。乒乓運動應民衆化是以邑中公共體育場及通俗敎育館。皆添設乒乓室。且聞將舉行全邑個人錦標賽云。夫乒乓一術。全在熟練熟練則出神入化。自趨妙境球之變化有長球短球轉球抽球殺球快球壓球之别復有抽而兼殺者謂之抽殺球快而兼殺者謂之快殺球。拍長球時用力較大。距桌較遠。　球則反之。長球緩而多抽短球快而多壓轉球分横豎横轉球板横眠而拍。球出勢緩有力。豎轉球板直立而拍球出勢急而猛抽球者抽起敵球。還攻對方殊有力。所謂殺球快壓攻人之球皆屬之。快球勢急足挫來球壓球所以應付高球者也。惟歸納乒乓球戰之狀態。僅分攻守兩種初學者宜先學守然後求攻。則收效可較速也。</p>
<h3>旅館失物爭訟賠損記旡用</h3>
<p>滬上名律師陸君去年冬爲代理上訴案件赴蘇州宿西善長巷大中旅館。入夜。所携皮袍棉襖圖章等。爲妙手空空者竊之去尋陸覺察詢諸館夥。館夥不以善言對頗有自不小心之怪辭。所謂（衣帽物件。各自當心。倘有遺失。與堂無涉）等不負責任語。殆深印腦中。藉以塞旅客口。陸不謂然。曰客投宿旅館。勢不能徹夜守物。門禁不嚴。而來盜竊。館中奚可辭咎。且旅店對於客人所携帶物品之毁損喪失應負責任。民事法理。當然如此何得諉卸陸之爲此說。欲旅館之明其責任。而表示相當歉意庶可寗息也詎旅館主爲過去之某署科長。在蘇城有一部分勢力。何物法律。寗足措意。初度。陸憤撰狀倩友某律師訴之吳縣地方法院法官傳審調查辯論終結矣。宣判日忽諭重開辯論。力勸和解遷延一年之久近經雙方律師簽訂和解契約。大中認賠欵項。由陸如數捐入隱貧會。一塲訟案于焉結束核計兩造所耗費。較初議賠損額達三倍訟則終凶而大中之初未能和氣待人。致星星燎原。事後回思。不覺啞然失笑也記者於某日宴座聞此事。特紀實以告一股旅館與旅客。</p>
<h3>南洋游記（一一四）靈花</h3>
<p>緬人建築術太不進步。不　住居。乃熱帶人之恒性。然得一大樹。在熱帶即爲其室。各小商店設於大樹下。蓋本來之房舍。即樹也。今漸進而用洋鐵爲蓋。而其房至日中甚熱。每不能居。即習慣止用一層鐵。不知加　一層木板。華人亦然。乃大缺點也。其房分三等。一方形茅蓬。二板屋加洋鐵蓋。三則有墻之建築也。至其形均正方。以一大方屋爲一家矣。住慣亦頗利便。頗似日本之板屋。再詩經秦風女子懷良人之詩云。言念君子。温其如玉。在彼板屋。亂我心曲。然則第一時代人多用板屋耶。</p>
<p>緬人慈悲柔和不殺。各地鳥不畏人。常來地上。見人不知驚避。有時婦人頭頂各食物。彼乃從上攫之而去。余昔在太原。常有鷹從天上飛下奪人手中所持物者。蓋一學理甚難過度。人愛物太甚。則禽獸逼人也。至各寳塔亦不甚潔凈。供養食物於佛。事實上亦養鳥所在耳。</p>
<p>吾細察緬人體格。與華人日本人無異。吾尙未至暹羅。聞亦與華人無異。大抵自緬甸以至日本。其人身體構造全同。種類一律。不過止有風俗語言裝飾宗敎等之差别。一去裝飾。甚難分辨。有時欲分辨緬人華人日人。殊不甚易。然若加拉人印度人南洋土人。則種不同。例諸土人之皮黑多毛。印人之身高而鼻高目深入。可證與白人爲原來同種也。惟緬甸有兩事。與中國有密切之關係。人種同。地理密邇雲南。而一事半與我異。不過印度化之純粹佛敎。我則一部分印度化而自有其文化耳。但若雲南騰越金沙江南出緬甸。順金沙江流下駛直至仰光。直通南洋海面。在國家時代亦甚便利也。此條願國民注意及之。</p>
<p>英國軍隊在緬境者甚少。因英人注意者現在不在緬甸。而全在中國邊境雲南徼外之要隘也。英人對於最可怕者。乃中國邊境軍事動靜。而對於緬甸内部已無甚防閑之需要。惟各地重要官員。則爲英人。緬人則任副者。及間散職務與執役也。</p>
<h3>無錫的新騙案烏劉</h3>
<p>世風日下盜賊蜂起。雖警衛森嚴之都市城邑竊盜案亦日有數起。人民之安樂生活、今非昔比。而新奇騙術。因近代科學昌明。更層出不窮矣。錫邑無敵牌製镁廠。日前來騙子二人。茲記其經過如下。</p>
<p>月之某日。廠中來二少年綢衣呢帽。服飾富麗、其一手提醫藥箱。進廠以行醫爲名謂（我等奉命濟世醫病給藥不取分文時廠主及職員均公出廠中僅廠主夫人汪詠霞女士及其男女公子二人。時夫人正患牙疾。左面部紅腫。騙即趨近作失驚狀曰。夫人體質虚甚不數日且有生命之危女公子織雲未經世故。聞言已恐慌萬狀。即詢以有救否。騙謂祇須在腰部用火筒抽出膿水少許即可無恙。且我等代醫。不索分文將來病愈後登報鳴謝足矣言時。火筒已自提箱中取出不待夫人允許已於其腰部將筒一按夫人憤甚。騙含笑曰夫人之病將愈矣。頃我已爲注射一針覺痛楚否抽出之膿水一杯在此言時即以火筒中之膿水傾入杯中。以示夫人。細察之。如婦人粘髮之鑤花水。知非善類乃出洋數角予之。詎騙謂夫人已打針須服人參補丸入枚否則已打針而不滋補必流血不止而死夫人故問此丸向何家藥房購辦騙謂此係秘製之品爲藥房中所不備言時又在提箱中出白丸八枚授夫人。謂每枚本須八元。現廉售六元。八枚共四十八元。至此夫人已確知其爲騙子。驚憤交集。即謂騙曰苟需人參亦决不向汝等購買。請速去爲妙騙知其計不售老羞成怒。睜目曰。打針不取費。購藥亦不願出費耶。洶洶然有動武之勢。夫人恐甚擬命公子鳴捕詎不見在側。正危急間。而公子已引警士二名入内。二騙見警至。兇威稍殺。惟口齒甚利。謂警士曰。我等係醫生因醫資而糾葛無與汝等事夫人聞言。一方謂警士曰。汝等負警衛職。爲我看管二人。一方囑其子速用電話召醫生。須臾。醫生至。疾言厲色。盤詰騙等。謂旣稱醫生。係何校卒業或從學何人。騙等瞠目無以答醫生取其所謂人參丸破而視之。則中係小蘇打粉外係蠟殼憤甚。欲送之醫藥總會懲辦。二騙始惶悚乞免醫生不允女士以未受損失力勸醫生縱之去。惟僞藥及火筒等扣留交警士取去毁滅。以免貽害他人云。</p>

<h3>美棉供給與價格之關係</h3>
<p>孟却斯德新聞載、利物浦商業學校會長兼埃及政府棉業顧問託德氏Ｊ·Ａ·ＴＯＵＤ發表原棉供給額與價格之關係云自八月一日至翌年七月三十一日、其間原棉供給量與其價格之關係、近來各國成爲議題、尤以美國爭論爲甚、然供給支配價格爲經濟學上之原則固不待論、惟在收穫價格與消費之相對關係上、若原棉可謂標本的商品矣、一季内之供給量爲一季内之收穫量及上期存貨之總和、而該供給量可以决定一季内之價格大致無甚差異、由左之統計有例外者二、其一爲一九二一二二年内所起之現象、同期受一般物價低落之影響、雖一季内供給量比較减少、而棉價均大暴落、此跌落趨勢與一般物價之下落、同其步調、第二爲最近二期内美棉價格之狀况、亦因供給雖减而棉價仍跌、或以此種原因歸咎於一般物價之跌落、然兩者間下落程度大相懸殊、若以此爲主因、不甚妥當尙有一說謂歸咎於美棉品質之劣下、殊較有根據也、最近政府所進行之棉價統制政策而爲價格之干涉、屢歸失敗、其價格依然爲供給所支配、誠不可忽視者焉、即就以上述理由爲根據、預測一九三○三一年之美棉價平均爲七便士七五、在不久的將來當可證是說之誤否（下表所列數量爲四七八磅重千包價格爲便士、）</p>

<h3>糧食米市銷呆下跌</h3>
<p>虞姬墩船擠軋斷</p>
<p>閘北　昨日各帮到船大稀、祇十號之譜、緣滬西虞姬墩貨船湧濟、交通因阻所致、但河下存度尙厚、各方買氣大呆北粳走銷尤滯高貨見疲角許、中次悉跌兩三角市况不振、薄稻銷懈市軟價短角半、羊秈到頭殊微、去路不化、行情趨疲、杜尖客胃零胃悉亦帶萎、市勢見小近角埠尖略見喊抵、高貨尙無榮辱、白元全日有三角上落、緣同一船貨、而吃户眼光不同、今市形一經告軟、出入遂多、但市情因銷呆關係而約跌角半之譜也、</p>
<p>滬南昨日河下到船不多、銷場平淡、常帮白粳由定而疲、蘇同粳交易寥落、各檔均小一兩角不等、南帮薄稻、早稻初呈定局、旋因北市及粳市之回疲而隨短角左銷路不暢、羊杜秈到銷兩淡、大勢微軟、通變陰元此間積貨不多、高者略小、中次見短角半、</p>
<h3>客秈街銷又活</h3>
<p>行情略好</p>
<p>昨日客秈市况、本街以河下到頭不多、復又注意客秈、故交易又見活潑、湖南米及南京各米均以到存兩少之故、行情均見微好、祇江西機晚因到存兩足、價反平軟、客元被厦門帮搜辦、市形亦呈佳象、今後如本客續有胃口、則客元客秈兩市當可站足矣統市開出湖南　紅米五百包價九元四角半、又中關機靖一百包、價十元○八角、南京機米一百四十包、價十元、南京糙米二百包、價八元五角九分、江西機晚一千餘包、價十一元三角二分、十一元、十元○七角、又機早三百包、價十元○五角至十元○三角、江西機元五百包、價十二元一角七分至十一元八角、湖南機元二百包、價十二元四角半至十二元三角七分、客秈統係本街搜去客元則均爲厦門帮辦裝云、</p>
<h3>廠家猛出中之粉市</h3>
<p>步步下落···遠期尤甚</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開市後逐盤趨小、步步下跌、市面幾似一　難振之象遠期粉爲廠家抛售、更比近期爲呆跌因某大廠獨家套出三十萬散廠十多萬、且因洋麥報價跌小三四角至九角之鉅、而市上更傳某洋行兜售三兩九錢之二號白麥、市上空氣愈見萎靡最後收市近期一二月份各小一分二五遠期三四五月份各小三分</p>
<h3>糖市日車糖漲後轉平</h3>
<p>昨日糖市産區電訊、古巴現糖價未變動紐約期糖僅十二月份升一分明年五月份跌一分餘無升沉爪哇期現糖亦乏升降、公會劉盤交易均靜、市氣平定、荷糖二十四號相砂白以號方向香港採辦現貨、可於年内赶緊運抵、而划本較宜</p>
<p>因是人心更虚、買氣岑寂、雖行方尙扳價九兩、奈乏問津、迄無成交、形勢已將醒醲回風矣高廿號中砂白八兩四錢、十八號中砂白八兩二錢、八號荷赤七兩七錢半、九號貨七兩八錢半、普通十號七兩九錢半、進出雖懈市尙堅定日糖存底殊薄但需要亦靜、市氣轉平、ＹＴ　九兩一錢半ＹＲＯ嘜八兩六錢二分半至八兩六錢、ＹＰ嘜九兩六錢、市均平疲、明治貨九兩六錢半、較爲俏秀太古五温糖少數略有開出、價爲十一兩一錢比前盤提高三錢、而市且俏手、號盤交易亦靜、陳貨八號荷赤、號索七兩五錢、均少問津云</p>
<h3>五福冰因産地停工而貨缺</h3>
<p>後盤勢必再升</p>
<p>厦門五福冰糖廠因國歷新年將届、已停止出品預備休息、是以來源日减、不數應第、此間總經理大來華號以申地各帮冬銷方殷、深恐該廠停工後五福冰有斷檔之虞爰於昨日電商厦廠、即日復工趕製運申、以應各帮需要、大約或加辦到、並聞末批貨已由厦裝出、數亦不多、且原料騰漲、號盤勢必再增云</p>
<h3>絲茶免稅後滬絲運湖日暢</h3>
<p>滬埠絲經運往浙湖、已奉政府核准免稅放行、一般絲織商邇來分向吳興絲織公會、請給憑單、以便將存絲運浙最近數日中、黃白絲經由滬裝往杭嘉湖各屬者、爲數不弱、昨日又有白絲經四十件、運吳興硤石等處云、</p>
<h3>茶市効形寥落</h3>
<p>本埠洋莊茶市、近來効形寥落、前數日洋行停上辦公、市面完全停頓、昨市怡和福時社德等行、對於珍眉珠茶、雖略有零星進胃但銷路不大、市價仍低、市面尙難認爲佳象至祁寗等路紅茶存底業已不多、但日來办均無人問及云、</p>
<h3>海味海帶産市回升</h3>
<p>海帶前因各檔新貨均獲豐收、産地來源又甚踴躍市盤步鬆行號手貨莫不虧本出售邇聞各地産市、均告回升、且滬存亦已逐漸化薄市氣故亦爲之一振昨行盤　售根室帶五兩五錢、浜中五兩三錢川路國后厚岸等五兩二錢、鬼莊四兩八錢、首長四兩六錢、猫足四兩二錢、二番四兩至三兩八錢、湘漢兩帮辦胃頗健、若川贛等處生意發動、而市有再漲之勢、帶絲被原料漲價市亦跟緊、刻號盤扳售廂館高貨八兩八錢、横浜貨七兩五錢、大阪貨七兩二錢少不願脫、</p>
<h3>疋頭東疋趨勢甚挺</h3>
<p>疋頭市面漲風益熾、各貨步漲不已、昨日莫干山直貢呢又漲二厘半、雙龍水浪絨亦硬彩條絨大有登峰造極之勢、秃藍條已達六兩九錢、色條須七兩二錢半、現貨尙呈絶跡之勢、考其原因、蓋滬上存底缺乏、大阪定價飛漲不已故來源斷檔、兼之嗣後適值銷令小東門一帶每日有四五件去路、故本客需求奇殷、老花直貢呢愈趨愈缺、至昨已須三錢四分半細　嘰客帮需要甚殷、湖心亭隨到隨罄行家期貨已開三錢一分、直貢緞以上身貨最硬、五路開三錢七分半八駿三錢七分、實爲從來未有之新高價惟月華絨因從前所定者陸續到滬、故依然毫無生氣、大柄曾至一錢九分二厘半、昨楊貴妃復售一錢九分中柄多數一錢八分七厘半、祇富華須一錢九分之外、黑花一錢八分二厘半云、</p>
<h3>五金東白鐵貨少價挺</h3>
<p>東白鐵到貨鮮少、惟各路客帮因趕辦年貨、需胃孔急、是以數日來成交達六七千張之鉅、惟市貨自經收辦後、益覺寥落、况東匯目下日緊、因此行情節節增加、計年張售九錢五分（六尺）、及一兩一錢五分、（七尺）、比之前市均好起二三分不等、但來日外匯依然趨昻、則標準恐亦有水漲船高之景况云、</p>
<h3>納格爾較上年漲一倍</h3>
<p>納格爾（即鎳）爲五金中繁銷品之一、但因成本高大、同業營業者較少、况天津嘆口諸帮均有</p>
<p>定貨、因此在申購辦者不多是以目下各同業對此購定者亦寡致市塲中幾流屬於冷門花色、但在下年到貨益少、而出路數倍於前、因此供不敷求、人心大好標準堅秀現市每担又估至一百六十三兩較之上春估八十五六珦、幾及一倍、而此貨漲價之速、對於外匯暴跌、亦不無若干影響也、聞近三四日來如兵工廠客帮等辦去共有一百八九十担之鉅云、</p>

<h3>美國文壇的新趨勢</h3>
<p>（四續）安平節譯</p>
<p>麥斯透是這一種活動裏的有一個詩人、在他自已所持有的天才的詩格之下、他曾經在‘‘ＴＨＥＳＰＯＯＮＲＩＶＥＲＡＮＴＢＯＬＯ’’一書裏、活活地畫出一幅在以前的美國的文壇裏所没有過的美國的鄉村印象、在那些詩裏、一個鄉鎭完全在一種灰色的、死的陰黝中存在着、</p>
<p>在這本集子裏、所有的詩、都充斥了這同樣的情感、這兒没有所謂（生命的活躍一、而祇是陰沉、憂鬱、以及充斥着一種寫實的色彩、在麥斯透先生看來、在現在這種都市發展着的年頭、鄉鎭所遭遇到便是如此、在那裏、生命根本便沉落在一種乾枯的情調裏、美的鼓舞無能存在那種環境裏、個人的靈魂、在那種情形下、也將滅亡、</p>
<p>對於别種背景、　不是關於鄉村的　的同樣的反映、在我們這個時代的詩裏、也常常存在着、桑朋曾經寫過一些關於都會的東西、正如麥斯透之寫着關於鄉村的東西一樣、他在他的ＳＭＯＫＥＡＮＤＳＴＥＥＬ裏、很咆哮地挑戰着、當在這反叛活動之初期過程中、郎特賽也曾大大的排斥恫嚇過、就是常常寫着那種平靜的農村生活的弗羅斯脫的詩、也並不因此而絶望、倘使弗羅斯脫的詩的精神是很成熟的、那並不是因爲他對於他詩裏所包涵的農村生活有一個先知的關係、在魯賓孫的詩裏、也並不缺少這種精神、在他的ＴＨＥＭＡＳＴＥＲ一詩裏、他的譏諷的句子、（店夥的年齡和價格的標準、是他對於這個時代的潮流的借譬、</p>
<p>這一切我們在ＴＨＥＳＰＯＯＮＲＩＵＥＲＡＮＴＨＥＬＯＧＹ裏所發現的、却找出了這個時代的許多小說的另一個局勢、蘇可（ＲＵＴＨＳＵＣＫＯＷ）在ＣＯＵＮＴＲＹＰＥＯＰＬＥ裏寫的農人、就如麥斯透在ＴＨＥＰＰＯＯＮＲＩＶＥＲ　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　ＡＮＴＢＯＬＯＹ裏所表現出的一機、在卡　（ＷＩＬＬＡＣＡＴＨＥＲ）的小說裏、尤其是在他的ＭＹＡＮＴＯＮＩＡ和ＴＨＥＰＲＯＦＥＳＳＯＲＳＨＵＳＯ裏、我們和那些老式農人的遭遇、和田野牧塲的腐敗正恰恰對照着、安得生在他的ＷＩＮＥＳＢＵＲＹＯＨＩＯＴＡＳＣＯＹＴＥＳＳＥＲＳＳＴＡＲＹ尤其是在他的ＰＯＯＲＷＨＩＴＳ裏搔有着同樣的問題、在這些作家的著作裏、我們就可以看出美國的農村的方面來、就其結果而言、他們都是美國的小說家、十足的美國人、那裏並没有什麽東西可以來模倣他們、安得生的ＷＩＮＥＳＢＵＲＹ和ＯＨＩＯ、正如弗羅斯脫的Ｎ。ＲＴＢＯＦＢＯＳＴＯＮ、麥斯透的ＳＰＯＯＮＲＩＶＥＡＮＴＯＬＯＧＹ或朗特賽的ＣＯＮＧＯ等一樣、完全是十足的美國貨、這些作家、不僅用着關於美國的題材來寫美國的事、並且將這些題材在一種形式或詩律下表現出來、</p>
<p>在我們現在所講的美國的新的潮流之中、没有一個能比路威士（ＳＩＮＣＬＡＩＲＬＯＷＩＳ）更卓越一些的、他的（大街）是用散文詩寫成的、路威士有着一種爲麥斯透所没有的諷刺的情調、那小城市的生活的空虚、那城市的居民的淺薄的生活、那種地方的情調等、這一些完全是一種正確的描寫、而在一種諷譏的筆法裏表現了出來、“ＢＡＢＢＩＩＴ”是一首很成功的詩、在這兒、我們重新有了一種美國的啓示、這種啓示、是爲前十九世紀所没有的、ＢＡＢＢＩＴＴ”完全是一種美國格式的東西、“ＺＥＮＩＴＨ”祇能算他一個美國的城市、ＥＩＮＥＲＧＡＮＴＲＹ祇能算作爲一美國人、就是他那種風格、那種諧謔的風格、也是美國式的、除了美國人之外、没有人能夥寫出像那種的東西、</p>
<p>在得利賽（ＴＨＥＯＤＯＴＥＤＲＥＯＳＥＲ）的小說和奥尼爾（ＥＮＧＥＮＥＯ’ＮＥＩＬＬ）的戲劇中、那種鄉村和小城市並不這樣常常表現出來、在奥尼爾的一部份早年的脚本中、也曾注意到這方面、但却並未能有何啓示、在另方面、奥尼爾也和得利賽一樣、他們却較趨向於都市和機械化一些、美國的戲劇、在奥尼爾以前、就如很早時候的美國的小說一樣、自從廿世紀以還、因爲美國的國際地位之增高、也如文字一樣、使美國的新戲劇得到一種新的力量、在巴萊（ＰＨＩＬＩＮＢＡＲＲＹ）、胡淫特（ＳＩＤＮＥＹＨＷＯＡＲＤ）葛林（ＰaulGreen）和奥尼爾等的作品裏、我們可以找出眞眞的美國戲劇、而在那些美國的戲劇家之中、尤其是奥尼爾更和美國的情調接近些、在他的“ＴＵＨＥＨＡＩＲＹＡＰＥ”“ＳＴＲＡＮＧＥＩＮＴＥＲＬＵＤＥ”Ｔ　”ＤＹＤＳＭＯ裏、對於美國環境裏的問題、的確有些表現、而非普通别的作家所能及、更有進者、他之表現美國的問題、而是用了美國本來所有的氣質的、在奥尼爾的作品之中、我們找不到一些些英國的氣息、而在另方面、他有着他自已的所特有的</p>
<p>奥尼爾的戲劇和得利賽的小說差不多、在他們的作品中、有着同樣的一種ＦＹＴＩＬＩＴＡＲＩＡＮＰＨＩＬＯＳＯＰＨＹ、雖然在奥尼爾的作品裏、爲得利賽所特别着重的（大商業）事件、不會有但對於美國的個人主義的命運的問題、也得如利賽一樣的涵有着、所有在得利賽的作品裏、在篇尾都有着一種句調丨那在近世社會上的個人的絶望的局勢、他所佔光的就是他的一種不是寫人的一優點、那個人的風度、那敏捷的靈魂、在他的筆調之下、常被毁滅了、那命運的恐　的影子、纒着他、使他失敗、這一種絶望的波浪、在得利賽和奥尼爾的任何的事件都可以看出、在那些非常情感濃鬱的脚本如“ＴＨＥＴＩＴＡＮ”‘ＴＨＥＦＩＮＡＮＣＩＥＲ”以及“ＴＨＥＡＭＥＲＩＣＡＮＴＲＡＧＣＤＹ”等裏、對於這點、完全流露了出來、而别的脚本如“ＢＥＹＯＮＤＴＨＥＨＯＲＩＺＯＮ“ＴＢＥＨＡＩＲＹ”ＡＰＥ”“ＤＯＳＩＲＥＵＮＤＥＲＨＥＦＬＮＳ”“ＳＴＲＡＵＧＥＬＮＬＯＲＬＵＤＯ”以及“ＤＹＮＡＭＯ”等裏、　然比較地不同着但也未能將這點克服過來、好比說、奥尼爾在“ＤＹＮＡＭＳ”裏、比‘ＢＥＹＯＮＤＴＨＥＴＨＯＲＩＺＯＮ”裏、還更趨沉在這一點上、在‘ＢＥＹＯＮＤＴＨＥＨＯＲＩＺＯＮ”一悲劇裏、人物却没有一定的部分、而在“ＤＹＮＯＭＯ”裏、則無論如何、那人物却有决斷的力量、在實際上、那人物、幾乎完全成爲一種玄妙的東西、一種妖魔、一種神道、個人不過是命運之奴隷、未來握在社會的全部的機搆裏、而不在他的創造者之掌中、</p>
<p>在現代的美國文學中正方興未艾的這全部的爭鬥、舉出了在這機器化的這社會中、個人生存之無能、或者、換句話說、在現在這哲學裏的個人主義之後面、仍然存在着一種社會的關係的、尤其是在和生存爭鬥中顯出自已的特質的文藝</p>
<p>家、在種種荒凉的情調裏學得有這種反感、在美國工業發達下所産生出來的美國的生活的標準、那蔓傳到藝術上去的商業主義、成爲現代美國的文藝家分别去攻擊的對象、</p>
<p>方幹民君之畫</p>
<p>是有着他的新　　　的、這文學上的新的爭論、供給了現在的批評家和文藝家以一種新鮮的戰塲、那些在巴皮脫（ＬＲＶＬＮＧＢＡＢＢＩＴＴ）和摩爾（ＰＡＵＯＡＬＭＥＲＭＯＲＯ）。指導之下的人性學家的文學家、他們和一切現代的精神叛反着、在這一個立場下、他們很明顯包涵了對於科學和這個機器時代之反抗、在他們倫理中、他們主持着他們的（善惡二元論）（ＤＵＡＬＩＳＭ）他們覺得旣要拯救個人、不能夠同時又稱頌機器、所以他們將宗敎代替了科學、來作爲一種評視價值之試金石、而不幸地、那些反對人性學家的人、不去握住那問題中的個人的關係、而祇是去攻擊那些新人性學家的宗敎意見、那二十世紀之重要的批評家門肯先生、（ＭＲＭＯＮＣＫＮ）的影響之衰落、對於這種紛難的問題上的正確的學識之供給、也無難地有着一部份原因的、</p>
<p>要是講到使美國文學成爲（美國的）他也確有了一番新的努力、在加皮爾（ＪＡＭＥＳＢＲＡＮＣＨＣＡＢＥＬＬ）或王爾豆（ＴＨＯＲＮＴＭＥＳＢＲＡＮＣＨＣＡＢＥＬＬ）或王爾豆（ＴＨＯＲＮＴＯＮＷＩＬＤＯＲ）的風樣裏、也許是不會有的、向在布哀底斯姆（ＰＯＩＣＴＥＳＭＥ）或潘羅（ＰＥＲＵ）、都集有着很大的興趣、或者、在那種作家、如派蘇斯（ＪＯＨＮＤＯＥＢＡＳＯＳ高爾特（ＭＩＣＨＡＥＬＧＯＬＤ）和漢明惠（ＥＲＮＥＬＳＨＥＭＩＮＧＷＡＹ）的作品裏、倒會在一種新的形式之下表現出來也未可知、（完）</p>

<h3>寫給包君程碧氷</h3>
<p>（四續）</p>
<p>不知從什麽地方來的、有一天我的衣袋裏竟有了二十塊洋錢、這我是感到富有的了、所以我也有了勇氣了、便託租房子爲名、和她的家庭内一位娘姨談話起來、我開口詢問（娘姨）說、</p>
<p>（你們這裏有房子召租嗎、）</p>
<p>（没有、）娘姨這樣回答人、</p>
<p>（你們這裏是一家住嗎、）</p>
<p>（是的、）</p>
<p>（你們這裏有位小姐、是嗎、）</p>
<p>（是的、）</p>
<p>（她在什麽學校裏讀書、）</p>
<p>（現在不讀書了、從前在光華大學裏　　、）</p>
<p>（唉、那末爲什麽原因她天天都跑到　　外面去呢、）</p>
<p>（跟外國人學打字、每天都要去的、</p>
<p>（她許配人家没有、）</p>
<p>（呸你這位先生不正經、）娘姨在叱　　責我、）</p>
<p>經過了這次的詢問以後、於是乎我的心内似乎感到舒服一點了、但是包君呀、仍然有不能使我滿意的是、那位娘姨爲什麽當我詢及她們小姐的婚姻問題時、便要對我施行秘密呢、難道她也知道了我在戀着她的小姐嗎、不然、那末原因又是爲的什麽呢、</p>
<p>○○</p>
<p>和娘姨分别以後、我便回到了我的亭子間裏來、但是、包君呀、身上旣然有了二十塊錢、那末怎樣我都不能夠在亭子間裏兩心坐住的呀、我覺得無論如何、我都非想法子將這二十塊錢化出去不可、可憐我平生都是没有分文的積蓄的、一旦得了二十塊錢、那得不想法子用出呢、　　走出了亭子間、我原想到咖啡店裏喫咖啡的、因爲咖啡店裏也有俄國百爵夫人的女招待、我也可以和她們談談的、在現在在我感覺到異性的飢渴的時候、</p>
<p>但是包君呀、這又是一件出乎意料之外的事、我是多麽的幸運呀、或者這是上帝在暗地裏帮忙我吧、憐我太孤單了、所以才特地裏給我一綫希望吧、</p>
<p>住在　　路一百六十一號裏的她、有一位貼身侍俾、我是認識的、她而且也曾看過我幾面的、那一天、我從亭子間裏走了出來、偏偏又在霞飛路上遇着她、我當即放了勇氣走上前去、給了她一塊洋錢、詢問她到什麽地方去、她收接了一塊洋錢之後、即回答我說、</p>
<p>（到藥舖裏去、）</p>
<p>（誰吃藥、）</p>
<p>（我們的太太、）</p>
<p>（就是你們小姐的母親嗎、）</p>
<p>（是的、）</p>
<p>（你們主人姓什麽、）</p>
<p>（姓曾、）</p>
<p>（什麽地方人、）</p>
<p>（哦、無怪乎你們小姐是這樣的美麗、廣西地方是山清水秀的呀、）</p>
<p>（閒話少說、你這位少爺問我這些話有什麽道理、）</p>
<p>（没有什麽道理、我再問你、你們老爺是做什麽營業的、）</p>
<p>（在交易所裏面、）</p>
<p>（我不相信、可以你們還說不來上海話呢、）</p>
<p>（到上海來没有多久、從前我們老爺是做師長的、自從革命失敗以後、我們老爺才改行做交易所生意的、）</p>
<p>（············）</p>
<p>唉唉、包君呀、原來她們也是和我一樣的呀、她們也是革命到了碰壁然後才到上海來的呀、唉唉、她們和我原是逃亡的同志呀、包君呀、我問明白了她們的身世、我自已又禁不住要流下眼淚來了呀、</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>第二天我寫了一封給ＭＩＳＳ曾的信、又送了那位丫頭兩塊洋錢、請那位侍婢替我轉遞過去、我便在　　路附近等待那位丫頭的回音了、</p>
<p>包君呀、你大約知道吧、這時的我的心情、是無論任何的筆墨都是不能夠形容於萬一的呀、</p>
<p>但是、包君、這又是多麽的不幸呢、可憐我在馬路上鵠候着、一點鐘、二點鐘、直等待十二點鐘的辰光、那位侍婢未見得出來、我知道受騙了、我只得　回我的亭子間裏去、可憐我的眼眶裏是噙住了淚珠的呀、</p>
<p>再等待第三天、我這才好容易找到了機會遇着了那位丫頭、我當即當面質問她、爲什麽昨天竟和我失約、她回答我說、（我們小姐看過信以後、將她駡了一頓了、）</p>
<p>（旣然這樣、那末你可以質問她、爲什麽在法國公園裏面、她要將她自己用的一魄絲手帕丢給我呢、）我也不甘示弱、所以是這樣的回答那位丫頭、</p>
<p>（這話我不好替你轉達、還是你自己親自去問她吧、）</p>
<p>（你們家裏、我不能走進去、怎麽好親自詢問她呢、）</p>
<p>（這有辦法、她每天下午三點鐘的時候、都要到馬斯南路　　號去學打字的、你候在馬路上好了、）</p>
<p>（眞的嗎、）</p>
<p>（我不騙你的、）</p>
<p>（好、謝謝你的指示、）這樣、我便又和那位丫頭分别回家來了、</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>但是、包君呀、等我第二天在馬斯南路中段會着ＭＬＩＳＳ曾的時候、我放大了勇氣、厚着臉皮招呼上去、ＭＩＳＳ曾却這樣的回答我這使我眞是不知如何答復是好呢、</p>
<p>（你的信我是看過了、我和你到現在才開始認識、連做朋友都談不上、怎麽談得上愛你呢、）</p>
<p>（那末、我們現在開始做朋友吧、ＭＩＳＳ曾、）我再懇求她、</p>
<p>（做朋友本來未嘗不可以、不過你若是抱着野心來和我交際、那末就恕我不能答應了、）</p>
<p>哦、哦、包君呀、我根本的就在愛着她呀、我不愛她、那末我又何必和她做朋友呢、可憐ＭＩＳＳ曾不諒解我、她總是要想拒絶我的愛、這我如何能忍受得住呢、這我如何能忍受得住呢、····</p>
<p>（我們由交際漸漸地開始戀愛、難道不可以嗎、）忽然我又福至心靈起來起出這話來說、</p>
<p>（那是指結果而言、成者我們將來連朋友的感情都不能維持也說不定、你若開始便抱着要和我結婚的野心、根本的錯誤了、）</p>
<p>包君呀、聽了這話以後、還能敎我回答她什麽呢、還能敎我回答她什麽呢、</p>
<p>（那末ＭＩＳＳ曾、你竟不願意和我做朋友了嗎、）終於我再想出這句問話來、</p>
<p>（我並没有說過這樣的話、）</p>
<p>唉唉、包君呀、我還是有希望的呀、我還是有希望的呀、ＭＩＳＳ曾並没有拒絶我呀○○○</p>
<p>但是、包君呀、我自從認識了她以後、我們的感情也很融洽、她對於我的爲人也能夠諒解、這我是多麽的高興呢、我覺得我的未來、正是幸福無量的呀、</p>
<p>然而、誰知這幾天來、因爲嚴厲的秋風的侵迫、她竟因之病倒了、我爲了這事、我着實担憂、我也曾到她的家庭内去打探過她的病狀、我看她這幾天的面貌委實消瘦了不少、我好像比較我自已身上的肉被人割去那樣還要痛苦、可憐蒼天總是愛捉弄人的、我的眼淚也不知爲她流了幾許了呀、</p>
<p>果如不幸、她的病症眞的醫治不好的話、那末我是决意跟蹤着　到地下去的、雖然現在我們只能說是朋友、但是我爲她而死、這在我方面、是並無絲毫的勉强的呀、</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>也曾有人勸我說、（大丈夫何患無妻）、這話本來是對的、但是、君呀、我若不得ＭＩＳＳ曾做我的妻、那末、我是感到生趣寂然的呀、我這一生都是無希望的了、我還不如用手槍打死了自已好呀、</p>
<p>因爲ＭＩＳＳ曾病了、我寫信給她看、又要累她的精神、所以我是改寫信給你了、包君我　　是不要緊的、討飯我、都不怕可是、我得不　ＭＩＳＳ曾做我的終身伴侣那末我還是去死了好呀、那末我還去死了好呀、唉、ＭＩＳＳ曾、我這封信雖然是寫給包君的、但是、你看了之後、可不知又作何種的感想呢、可不知又作何　的感想呢、唉唉、包君、你者是喜歡吃　酒的話、那末你也應當替我祈禱上帝、祝ＭＩＳＳ曾的病症早日痊愈、更應當祝我們的戀愛早日成功的、呀、再會了、我在此也祝你的身體健康、祝你的賢内助的肺病早日轉機過來、算作這是我們相互祈禱的交換條件吧、（完）</p>

<h3>The Legislative Yuan Passes the Ordinance on Amnesty for Political Prisoners</h3>
<p>To be Promulgated and Implemented on New Year's Day</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The draft Ordinance on Amnesty for Political Prisoners, having been amended and passed by the Legislative Yuan at its 1123rd meeting on the 27th, consisting of nine articles in full, will be presented to the National Government for promulgation and implementation on New Year's Day of the 20th year of the Republic of China. The contents of the ordinance are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) All political prisoners prior to December 31st of the 19th year of the Republic of China shall be pardoned, with the exception of the arch-criminals who betrayed the Party and the State, the incorrigible Communists, or those who have committed treasonous acts.</p>
<p>(2) Political prisoners refer to those who have committed the crimes of internal disorder, counter-revolution, and crimes of the same nature as internal disorder and counter-revolution as defined by laws and regulations. (Those wanted for political suspicion are regarded as political prisoners.)</p>
<p>(3) The arch-criminals who betrayed the Party and the State refer to the following criminals: 1. The arch-criminals who rebelled in Guangzhou on June 16th of the 11th year of the Republic of China. 2. The arch-criminals who rebelled in Beiping on September 9th of the 19th year of the Republic of China and organized a puppet government.</p>
<p>(4) Incorrigible Communists refer to Communists who have not confessed themselves according to the Statute for Communists to Surrender.</p>
<p>(5) Those who have committed treasonous acts refer to those who have committed crimes of foreign aggression or the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, or other crimes of the same nature as foreign aggression as defined by laws and regulations.</p>
<p>(6) If a political prisoner has incidentally committed other crimes, the other crimes will not be pardoned.</p>
<p>(7) All political prisoners who should be pardoned, whether undiscovered or previously wanted but not captured, shall be exempt from investigation. Those already apprehended, whether prosecuted or not, whether sentenced or not, shall be examined and released by a committee organized by the president of the High Court, the chief prosecutor, and two judges and one prosecutor. A form shall be filled out and submitted to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for record. If there are any doubts, the Ministry of Judicial Administration should be consulted for instructions in advance.</p>
<p>For prisoners tried by military law, a committee consisting of three military officers and two military judges from the relevant military agency shall be organized to approve the release. A form shall be filled out and submitted to the Ministry of Military Administration for record. If there are any doubts, the Ministry of Military Administration should be consulted for instructions in advance.</p>
<p>When Communists who have confessed themselves according to the Statute for Communists to Surrender are approved for release, there should also be at least two reliable guarantors who jointly provide a guarantee letter, guaranteeing that they will not commit the crimes in Articles 2 to 7 of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries again.</p>
<p>Communists who have had their sentences reduced or partially exempted due to surrender may be transferred to a repentance institute after being pardoned.</p>

<h3>Anti-Dumping Tax</h3>
<p>Three Ministers Review and Approve the Ordinance</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance, considering that China's industry is still in its infancy and exports have difficulty competing with imported foreign goods, has specifically formulated the Ordinance on Anti-Dumping Tax in order to prevent improper undercutting of imported goods, and has submitted it to the Executive Yuan for review and approval. The Yuan has ordered Ministers Kong Xiangxi, Song Ziwen, and Sun Ke to review, revise, and rename it the Ordinance on Anti-Dumping Tax. The contents are: (1) When foreign goods compete with similar domestic goods by means of dumping, an anti-dumping tax may be levied in addition to import duties. (2) The price of foreign goods when exported to China, or the wholesale price in China, after deducting transportation, insurance, and other necessary expenses, shall be considered dumping if it is A, lower than the market price in the exporting country; B, lower than the market price in any country other than China; C, lower than the manufacturing cost. (3) The Ministries of Industry and Finance shall each send three people to form a review committee, which may investigate and research either on its own initiative or in response to complaints from interested parties. (4) If, after review, the nature of dumping is confirmed, the case shall be reported to the Ministries of Finance and Industry for handling. (5) If deemed necessary based on the above report, a dumping tax may be levied. (6) The tax rate shall be limited to the difference between the export price or the wholesale price in the Chinese market (excluding expenses) and the three prices in item 2. (7) When foreign goods compete with domestic goods by directly or indirectly receiving subsidies, an anti-dumping tax not exceeding the amount of the subsidies received shall be levied.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Why the World is So Troubled</h3>
<p>What keeps the world from collapsing boils down to three things: goods, cash, and labor. Goods rely on merchants for sales, on labor for production, and on money for buying and selling. People, in turn, rely on the smooth sale of goods for employment, and money relies on the operation of commerce and industry for circulation. If these three are out of balance, the world becomes troubled.</p>
<p>Looking at today's foreign news, is there anything that isn't troubled by these three? The disputes over sugar production restrictions between India, Cuba, and Germany, and the disputes over the restriction of tin mine production in Southeast Asia, are all due to excess goods that can't be sold. If goods can't be sold, factories will shut down, money will be scarce, and panic will ensue. The U.S. Federal Reserve reported that industrial production in December remained low, unemployment continued to increase, and the economic downturn had not eased slightly. This is because labor is stagnating due to goods not being sold. If labor stagnates, the panic of unemployment becomes even more unmanageable. In addition, U.S. government financial experts claim that France's hoarding of $200 million in U.S. dollars only accounts for one-fifth of the world's gold supply, and that gold-producing countries are constantly releasing their gold reserves, so it is not enough to endanger countries on the gold standard. However, the trend of expensive gold is like this. Although the reason is not entirely due to hoarding, the lack of cash is already evident. The more expensive gold becomes, the cheaper silver becomes, and both commerce and labor are affected. Even countries on the gold standard may not see any benefit. In this situation, Soviet Russia is thinking about how to break through this difficult barrier of imbalance and adopt a policy of throwing away goods and selling them cheaply, hoping that factories can continue to operate and money can be absorbed. Therefore, at a time when businesses in various countries are feeling the decline, Soviet Russia's businesses in Britain and the United States have reported a surge. Is this a small effect of its strategy? However, given the overall trend, this kind of simple small policy may not be effective. The result is only a temporary surge of excitement and the fruit of turmoil.</p>
<p>Received Important Domestic Telegrams</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Headquarters of the Sixth Route Army telegraphed from the capital on the 26th, stating: (1) Mao's Division and Xiang's Brigade engaged in a fierce battle with more than 7,000 Communist bandits near Guangchang on the 26th for four hours, killing many bandits. The bandits retreated towards Toubeixi. Guangchang was recaptured. Tao's Brigade has advanced to the vicinity of Raoshan and is engaging in fierce battles with the bandits in the deep mountains.

<h3>Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Implement Inter-Provincial Joint Defense</h3>

<h3>Xiaocheng Under Siege</h3>
<p>Li Yong'an Asks Han Deqin for Reorganization</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) After the remnants of Li Yong'an's troops stationed in Xiao were besieged in Xiaocheng by Han Deqin's troops yesterday, Li requested reorganization. Han was stationed in Snail Village, three miles east of Xiaocheng, to command the operation, ordering the surrender of weapons. Conflicts broke out across the city walls on the morning of the 27th. Representatives from various organizations in Xiao went out of the city to ask Han's troops not to attack the city, so as to avoid affecting the people. Li also sent representatives to visit Han, willing to use his family as hostages to accept reorganization, but unwilling to surrender weapons. Negotiations are underway. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>News from the 52nd Division in Xuzhou: Han Deqin is still commanding in Xiao, besieging Xiao on all sides. Li Yong'an's troops have no way to escape. Han, in order to protect the people of Xiao, did not immediately attack the city and is negotiating the surrender of weapons. Li's troops may submit. Long-distance calls to Xiaocheng can still be made, but various agencies in the city seem to have been monitored by people sent by Li. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<h3>East River Defense is Solid</h3>
<p>Xiang's Division Has No Need to Enter Fujian</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Xiang Hanping said that the defense of the East River is solid, and the Jiangxi Communists have no ability to sneak in. The military strength in Fujian is also sufficient. This division has no need to enter Fujian. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chiang Guangnai changed his plan to go to Jiangxi after New Year's Day to supervise the suppression. Huang Yanzhen returned to the province from Shaozhou on the evening of the 26th, reporting that the Jiangxi Communists had fled to northern Guangdong and were at peace. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<h3>Situation of the Jin Army's Organization</h3>
<p>Regiment Will Be the Basic Unit</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Xueliang issued an organizational table on the 26th, which is the organizational table of the Northeast Army, with the regiment as the basic unit and no division or army organization. In the future, the titles of army commanders such as Xu, Shang, Fu, Yang, and Song may have to be cancelled. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to the resolution to reduce the number of divisions to eleven, which was made a few days ago, the Jin and Feng armies must cut two-thirds of their troops. The Jin army should cut 58 regiments, but the actual number of people is mostly insufficient, and guns are especially lacking, so the layoffs are not difficult. However, there are too many senior officers, and it will be difficult to arrange them in the future. It is now decided that none of the four people, Xu, Fu, etc., will concurrently serve as division commanders, and none of the eight division commanders will be allowed to concurrently serve as brigade commanders, in order to free up positions. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The financial problems of Jin and Sui were not discussed on the 27th. Qiu Yantian, the director of the Jin Finance Department, and the generals of the Jin Army and the Northwest Army were all in their residences on the evening of the 27th, waiting for a phone call from the headquarters to continue discussing the unfinished matters. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Gao Guizi telegraphed from Taiyuan to Tianjin, stating that his troops of 7,000 only seek to be organized into a brigade, which is sufficient. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<h3>Conference on Revoking the Submarine Cable Agreement</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Communications continued its meeting with the Pacific Commercial Submarine Cable Company on the morning of the 27th to discuss issues such as the right to collect money, the landing period, and reporting fees. The opinions of both sides were relatively close. The representative side agreed to reply on the 28th. In the afternoon, it continued its meeting with the Great Eastern and Great Northern Submarine Cable Companies to discuss the issues: (1) Our side still proposed the original proposal on the right of collection and distribution, which should be completely autonomous. The company side only agreed that the Chinese government should send an important official to serve in the company's collection and distribution office, and the rest of the staff should still be appointed by the company. Our side believes that sending only one person from the Chinese government still cannot achieve the goal of autonomy, so this issue has been disputed for a long time without any results. (2) Regarding the landing period, the company side still insisted on 18 years, which is too far from what our side recognizes. (3) Regarding the issue of land cables, our side believes that the land cables were allocated a price of so much foreign currency by the Chinese government and are the inherent property of the Chinese government and should be recovered immediately. The company side believes that the land cables were built on behalf of the company, and the cost is not just this amount. The dispute between the two sides has not yielded any results. (4) Regarding the issue of quotations, our side proposed a line fee of 60 cents, which the company side was also unwilling to accept. Finally, the company representative only agreed to consider it again and reply on the 29th. After the meeting, the telegraph and communications committee members on our side held an extraordinary meeting again at 6 o'clock to re-examine the company's insistence and the response measures. Everyone agreed that there are only a few days left until the expiration of the old contract, and the other party has repeatedly delayed without any sincerity in resolving the matter. It was decided to adopt appropriate measures to safeguard sovereignty on the one hand, and submit a report to the government for approval on the other hand. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>

<h3>The Calamity of War in Gansu is Cruel</h3>
<p>Large-Scale Massacre of Han People</p>
<p>Appeals from Gansu Natives in Beiping</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fellow Gansu natives submitted letters to newspapers in Beiping and Tianjin, appealing that Ma Tingxian, Ma Tingying, and Ma Zhongying's three units, entrenched in the Liangzhou, Dahe, and Tianshui regions, are massacring Han people on a large scale, flying the banner of the Revolutionary Army, and vigorously burning and looting. More than 4,000 people were killed in Tianshui, not including those who hanged themselves or jumped into wells. Lixian was besieged for more than a month before being captured and a city cleansing was carried out, killing an estimated 23,000 people, leaving only young women and good-looking boys, all for rape. The bandits have now occupied all 14 counties in southern Gansu. In several of the cities, due to excessive killing, there is only the stench of corpses to this day, and no human habitation. It has truly become a world of beasts. Ma and others are strictly inspecting the mail and telegraphs, so the central government is unaware of the tragic situation. We weep and implore the newspapers to publish this so that the central army can enter Gansu as soon as possible, comfort the people, punish the criminals, and protect the survivors, etc. In addition, the Beiping Post Office issued a public letter stating that Qin Prefecture in Gansu Province was captured by 40,000 (Revolutionary Army) troops. The severity of the massacre is unprecedented. The Qin Prefecture Post Office was also searched and plundered, and more than 50 bags of parcels were robbed. The post office cannot be held responsible, etc. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>

<h3>Total Amount of French Gold Reserves</h3>
<p>Exceeds 2 Billion Gold Dollars</p>
<p>Only Half of the United States' Reserves</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 26th: Government financial experts claimed today that they are not worried about French hoarding of cash. Although the total amount of gold stored in France exceeds US$2,000,000,000, it is only half of the amount stored in the United States. It is estimated that the world's total gold supply is worth US$10,000,000,000, meaning that France only accounts for one-fifth of the world's gold supply. According to the experts' statement today, when gold-producing countries constantly release their gold reserves, France's hoarding of gold is not enough to endanger the gold standard. France has received gold payments from Britain and Germany and at the same time is not borrowing foreign debt as usual, so its gold reserves are increasing.</p>
<h3>The Beginning and End of the Korean Communist Party Case</h3>
<p>Japan United News, Seoul, 27th: Starting in early June of last year, the Jongno Police Station here arrested dozens of people suspected of being communists, namely, the International Communist Party branch's conspiracy to reorganize the Korean Communist Party. Later, the Japanese authorities prohibited newspapers from publishing, and this prohibition was lifted at 11:00 a.m. on the 27th. The general outline is as follows:</p>
<p>Those arrested by the Jongno Police Station at that time were An Sang-hun and several others who entered Korea from Moscow in April of last year with the mission of reorganizing the International Communist Party branch. A total of more than eighty students were lurking in various schools in Seoul, of whom forty-six were the most suspected. On July 16th of last year, they were sent to the Gyeongseong District Court Prosecutor's Office. After the Prosecutor's Office clarified the investigation on July 26th, twenty-four people were released, and the remaining twenty-two were prosecuted and subjected to preliminary hearings for violating the Public Security Preservation Law. The "outline of the incident" is that the Korean communist movement has been divided into the ML Party, the Kayo-kai, the North Wind Society, the January Society, the Labor Association, the Labor Union, the Seoul Youth Association, the Shanghai faction, etc., each with different claims and vying for power, and have been unable to tolerate each other. At the International Communist Party Congress held in Moscow in October of the year before last, the Korean representatives who attended the congress stated the lack of unity of the Korean Communist Party. Therefore, An Sang-hun, who held the reins of the Korean Communist Youth Party, brought the decision on the Korean issue decided at the Moscow Congress in October of the year before last, carrying the mission of reorganizing the Korean Communist Party, and entered Korea in April of last year. They distributed leaflets like the ones on the left in Seoul in order to provoke the communist movement:</p>
<p>(We should abandon our past attitude, transcend party factions, and unite zealous communists in Gyeongseong. On the one hand, we should contact the Korean Communist Youth Party and reading groups and combine with the faction of Li Minyong, Li Junyeol, Zheng Heontae, and Fang Hanmin. We have held several cadre meetings in Seoul to discuss preparations for local organizations. Once the unification is completed and recognized by the Moscow International Communist Party Headquarters, we will agree to deny the Governor-General's politics, fundamentally reform the education system, with the opening of the Korean Exposition in mid-September of this year as the deadline.)</p>
<h3>Content of the International Agreement to Restrict Tin Production</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th: The chairman of the Tin Producers Association has issued a notice to members, stating the plan for an international agreement on tin mine production quotas. This agreement is currently under final consideration by the governments of the countries concerned and can be implemented if all agree. The terms are as follows: (1) The international quota must be calculated from January 1, 1931. All tin or tin ingots exported after the end of December must be included in the quota for the first quarter of 1931. (2) This agreement shall remain in effect for two years. (3) The quota can be changed at any time according to circumstances, because the purpose of this agreement is to adjust supply and demand and reduce existing inventories to normal levels, but the quota ratio must not be changed at any time. (4) The ratio is based on the production in 1929. For example, the Malayan ratio represents the amount of tin exported by Malaya in 1929 as a percentage of world production, which is 37.14%. The rest are deduced in the same way. The ratio of Bolivia, the Dutch East Indies, and Nigeria is 49.6%. The quota represents the maximum tonnage that can be exported from January 1, 1931. The amount of each quota is determined according to the total amount of tin to be exported under this agreement, determined according to the ratio. (5) This agreement stipulates that an advisory committee composed of representatives appointed by the producers and their governments will assist in handling matters arising from Article 4. It is reported that the above agreement includes 90% of the world's tin production. The Financial Times has learned that the governments of the Dutch East Indies, Bolivia, and Nigeria have expressed their agreement with this tin quota, and the governments of Malaya and others can also have no objection. As for the other aspects that account for 10% of the world's production and are not within the scope of this plan, Myanmar and Siam are the most important, but the tin ingots of these two countries are almost all transported to the Straits Settlements for refining, so they can be indirectly restricted by means of export licenses.</p>

<h3>Various Armies Stationed in Shandong Begin Downsizing</h3>
<p>Liu Yongji and Sun Enliang's Two Regiments Dismissed</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Most of the miscellaneous troops in this province are assembled from local militia groups. Their military discipline and moral conduct are not very good. Han Fuju, Commander-in-Chief of the 1st Army Corps, with the intention of reducing the burden on the people, specially presented to the Central Government and successively disarmed and dismissed Lu Xinwu's 2nd Garrison Brigade, Wang Guide's Provisional 1st Cavalry Division, and Kang Hanmin's Independent Regiment. With the recent downsizing order, the basic units of the 3rd Route Army must still be downsized, and the miscellaneous troops cannot be retained. Therefore, a telegram was sent to transfer Liu Yongji's 1st Garrison Regiment stationed in Qingzhou and Sun Enliang's 2nd Garrison Regiment stationed in Pingyuan to Jinan for training at the Xinzhuang Barracks. At 7:00 a.m. on the 25th, Han sent Lei Taiping's pistol brigade, Gu Liangmin's 22nd Division, Li Yizhi's 64th Brigade, and Ma Jingong's 29th Brigade of the 20th Division to prepare in the vicinity. He also ordered Chief of Staff Li Zongbi and Chief of the Staff Department Zhao Yizai of the General Headquarters to go to Xinzhuang to summon Liu Yongji and Sun Enliang's troops to give instructions, and then ordered the disarmament. The two troops did not resist. All firearms were handed over to Li Yizhi's 64th Brigade. A total of more than 600 rifles and more than 200 pistols were collected. All officers and soldiers were transported to Jiaodong by train for dismissal. Liu Yongji's troops were originally reorganized from the Guangrao militia, and Sun Enliang's troops were reorganized from Zhao Mingyuan's 19th Division stationed in Anqiu and Gaomi Mountain. All officers and soldiers are registered in various counties in Jiaodong, so they were transported to Jiaodong for dismissal this time. (26th)</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan 123rd Meeting</h3>
<p>Revised Draft of the Political Prisoner Amnesty Act Passed</p>
<p>The Legislative Yuan convened its 123rd meeting at 8:00 AM today (the 27th). Forty-one committee members were in attendance, including Liu Guantun, Luo Ding, Shi Shangkuan, Lu Zhonglin, Liu Ke, and Wu Shangying. Hu Hanmin presided over the meeting. The following matters were discussed: (1) The proposal to enact regulations for the management of the Red Cross Society was decided to be submitted to the Foreign Affairs and Military Affairs Committees for review. (2) The Executive Yuan's request to promptly draft a household registration law was decided to be submitted to the Autonomy Law and Civil Law drafting committees, together with committee member Hao Mingjun, to draft the law. (3) The draft of the Anti-Dumping Tax Regulations was decided to be submitted to the Economics and Finance Committees for review. (4) The Legal System Committee of the Legislative Yuan reported on the review of the draft of the Political Prisoner Amnesty Act and the list of political prisoner amnesty cases, which was decided to be amended and passed. (5) The amendment to the Internal Affairs Ministry's organizational law to add a Health Department was decided to be submitted to the Legal System Committee for review. (6) The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan reported on the review of the Nationality Law Convention and Protocol, and declared reservations on certain articles, which was decided to be passed according to the review report. Article 4 of the convention, regarding the prohibition of diplomatic protection, is based on the principle of territoriality, which is contrary to our country's principle of jus sanguinis, and particularly conflicts with the policy of protecting overseas Chinese, so it should be reserved. In addition, the protocol on military service for people with dual nationality is also inconsistent with our country's principle of jus sanguinis and is difficult to ratify. As for the remaining articles of the convention and the two protocols on statelessness, the content is generally appropriate and it is proposed to ratify them as they are. (7) The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan reported on the review of the amendment to the organizational regulations of the Chinese plenipotentiary representative office to the League of Nations, which was decided to be passed according to the review report with amendments. According to the review results, since China has not yet joined the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations, the duties of the Chinese representative office to the League of Nations are not burdensome, and there is no need to expand the organization or add a deputy representative and specialized committee members. The proposal is difficult to establish. (8) The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan reported on the review of the International Telegraph Regulations, which was decided to be passed according to the review report. The regulations were signed in Paris on October 29, 1925, based on the provisions of Article 13 of the St. Petersburg International Telegraph Convention. The revised articles were signed in Beijing on September 22, 1928, and have been signed by our country's representatives. Article 16, paragraph 3 of the St. Petersburg International Telegraph Convention of 1875 stipulates that any revisions to the convention must be approved by the governments of the participating countries before they can be implemented. It only mentions approval, not ratification. Furthermore, the regulations have been stipulated to be implemented from November 1, 1926, and the revised articles have also been stipulated to be implemented from October 1, 1929. Therefore, based on the articles and the facts, it seems that there is no need for ratification.</p>
<h3>Qingdao-Sasebo Submarine Cable to Be Recovered</h3>
<p>Liang Lieya Discusses the Past and Future</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After negotiations between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Japanese side, an agreement has been reached regarding the submarine cable between Qingdao and Sasebo, and it has been decided to hand it over. The signing will take place soon. I visited Liang Lieya, the director of the Shandong Provincial Telegraph Administration, today to inquire about the signing date of the Qingdao-Sasebo cable and its operation after the recovery. According to him, there are no problems with the negotiation of the Qingdao-Sasebo cable, but it has not yet been signed. However, the handover should be possible by January 5th or 6th of next year. Liang also discussed in detail the past history of the Qingdao-Sasebo cable and its operation after the recovery, which is described separately below: (1) History: During the German occupation of Jiaozhou Bay, after the Middle East War and the outbreak of the European War, the Japanese took the opportunity to occupy Qingdao. After the end of the European War, our country's representatives protested at the Paris Peace Conference, refusing to recognize Japan's forced occupation of all German rights in Shandong. Fortunately, with the agreement of various countries, a partial solution was reached, which the world calls the Shandong Case Agreement. The agreement has 28 articles, and the one concerning the submarine cable problem is that (Japan stated that all rights and interests of the former German submarine cables between Qingdao and Yantai and between Qingdao and Shanghai belong to China. However, a portion of these two lines is used by Japan as the submarine cable between Qingdao and Sasebo, which is not included in this case. The method for the submarine cable between Qingdao and Sasebo shall be agreed upon by the Sino-Japanese Committee), etc. According to the content of the article, the Qingdao-Sasebo cable still belongs to Japan. The mention of a separate agreement only concerns the landing and operation in Qingdao. In the autumn of the eleventh year, when China and Japan held the Shandong Case Post-Settlement Conference in Beiping, the authorities raised the issue of the Qingdao-Sasebo cable's sovereignty. Later, the solution was that China and Japan would each have half of the cable, with China operating it at the Qingdao end and Japan operating it at the Sasebo end. As for the operation of the cable at the Qingdao end, at Japan's request, the Chinese government could not continue after the expiration of the exclusive period of the telegraph concession owned by the Great Eastern and Great Northern Company. Therefore, before the cancellation of the aforementioned telegraph concession, it was temporarily entrusted to Japan for agency, which is now the Qingdao-Sasebo Submarine Cable Operation Office (currently, the Qingdao Telegraph Bureau has an operation office). However, financial receipts and disbursements and telegram delivery matters are all handled by the Qingdao Telegraph Bureau. As for all the measures of the operation office, they are to be agreed upon by China and Japan, and a resolution was reached at the end of the thirteenth year, which is the so-called Qingdao-Sasebo Submarine Cable Contract. Starting on February 1st of the fourteenth year, China took over the submarine cable at the Qingdao end and began communication.</p>
<p>(2) Situation: The Qingdao end of the Qingdao-Sasebo submarine cable is at 125 degrees 3 minutes 5 seconds east longitude and 33 degrees 58 minutes 55 seconds north latitude, with a length of 268 and 186 nautical miles, and belongs to China. The total length of the cable is approximately 536 nautical miles. If there is a line obstruction on the Chinese end, it should be repaired by China. Whenever there is damage, China often entrusts Japan for agency due to the lack of submarine cable repair ships. Each repair cost is often ten thousand gold. Now that the submarine cable concession is about to be recovered, serious attention should be paid to the repair and purchase of submarine cable ships, which cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>(3) Employees: The submarine cable office currently has one Japanese director, technician, general affairs clerk, and mechanic each, and six Japanese telegraph operators. After the recovery, the Japanese staff should be dismissed, and the vacant positions should be filled by Chinese telegraph operators who know Japanese. If negotiations with the Japanese side require some Japanese employees to be retained, at most only one mechanic should be allowed to remain, and all telegraph operators must be Chinese.</p>
<p>(4) Telegram Fees: The monthly income from telegram fees for the Qingdao-Sasebo cable is approximately more than 20,000 yuan, of which the foreign line fees account for a large portion, totaling approximately a monthly amount to be given to Japan. However, during the Zhang Zongchang era, the telegraph authorities withheld and withdrew the funds, resulting in the largest arrears. However, the Japanese side also owes our country some money, but the amount is small. After the settlement of the Jinan Incident and the establishment of the Shandong Telegraph Administration by the National Government, the administration believed that this cable was of international importance and attracted attention from both China and foreign countries, and that efforts should be made to recover it. Therefore, it raised approximately 10,000 yuan per month for payment, and currently only owes more than 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(5) Recovery: The Japanese invasion of Shandong aims to support its imperialism in the Liaodong Peninsula, to obtain the coastal peninsula of Shandong to consolidate its sea defense in the Sea of Japan, and to achieve its dream of destroying China. Therefore, it urgently wants to obtain rights in transportation facilities to expand its imperialist goals. We are revolutionaries and public servants of the people, and we must quickly catch up in our duties and try to recover them as soon as possible to strengthen our country. In addition to preparing funds to repay the arrears every month in the 17th, 18th, and 19th years, sufficient funds have now been raised, and the Ministry of Transportation is negotiating with the Japanese ambassador to recover the cable on January 1st of next year. As for the machines and equipment used in the submarine cable office, they are all purchased from the Japanese. Since our country currently has not purchased any, it intends to purchase them from the Japanese together, and intends to add an international telecommunications section to the Shandong Telegraph Administration to assign personnel to be in charge of international communications for Qingdao-Sasebo and Yantai-Dalian (Yantai to Dalian) to show caution.

<h3>Li Yongan's Troops Stationed in Xiao County Ordered to Disband</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Independent Brigade of the 8th Army, led by Li Yongan, was originally a bandit gang from Gushi that was recruited. Li's original name was Ke Bang, and he changed it to the current name after being recruited. At first, he was under the jurisdiction of Ye Kaixin and stationed in Haozhou. After the 8th Army headquarters was abolished, Li's troops were transferred to Xiao County and nominally under the command of the 52nd Division. Division Commander Han Deqin recently received a telegram order from Liu Zhi, the commander-in-chief of the 2nd Army Corps, relaying an order from Chairman Chiang, stating that Li's troops had poor military discipline and complex elements, and ordering them to be disbanded immediately. After receiving the order, Han telegraphed Li Yongan to come to Xuzhou, but Li did not respond. Therefore, on the evening of the 25th, Han sent Brigade Commander Zhang Zhongfu, leading Li Shusen's regiment of the 1st Regiment and Gan Dachao's regiment of the 3rd Regiment, to depart from the Jinpu and Longhai Railways, respectively. Zhang led the 1st Regiment south on a train from Xuzhou, got off at Sanbu, and the 3rd Regiment went west on a train from the Longhai Railway and got off at Yanglou, heading to Xiao County at the same time. At dawn today (the 26th), they arrived outside Xiao County City separately. They completely disarmed the troops stationed outside the city by Li's troops, about four or five hundred people. However, Li's brigade headquarters was located in Cangxiang in the city, and there were still a thousand troops in the city. Upon hearing the news, they immediately closed the city and refused to defend. Brigade Commander Zhang considered that the city was densely populated, so it was not convenient to enforce it by force. Therefore, he set up a team to monitor and reported to Xuzhou at the same time. After receiving the report, Commander Han immediately ordered Chief of Staff Luo Tiehua and Chief of Staff Ge Jinrong to inquire about the situation in the city from the Xiao County government by long-distance telephone. Wang Gongyu, the magistrate of Xiao County, replied that the order was still good, and Li was entrenched in the city, hoping to request reorganization, etc. Han immediately led two battalions of infantry from the 2nd Regiment and a company of the artillery battalion, and drove to Xiao County by car at 12:00 noon. The distance between Xiao and Xu is only fifty miles, and it can be reached in one hour. Now Han has ordered the troops arriving in Xiao to surround the city of Xiao, suppress it with military force, and order it to disarm today. Han himself is directing the deployment two miles away from Xiao City. At the moment, Xiao County's long-distance telephone is still open, directly to the 52nd Division headquarters, and reporting at any time. It is said that Li's troops have about a thousand guns, and other war weapons are generally lacking. It is expected to be resolved. (26th)</p>

<h3>Reactionary Suspects Arrested in Bengbu</h3>
<p>Rural Normal School Students Arrested</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: According to a secret report received by the military, police, and party affairs agencies here a few days ago, reactionary elements were secretly active in the Second Provincial Rural Normal School south of Bengbu Mountain, plotting against the law. A team was dispatched to surround the area, and various publications were found, and ten people including Hou Mengxuan, the director of teaching affairs of the school, Xie Juemin, the director of discipline, Wang Baosheng, the secretary, and students Zhu Wenhao, Tong Xiemin, Zhou Guangmo, gatekeeper Zhan Zhao, cooks Xu Zhenlun, Weng Fenglan, and Cheng Xiangfu were arrested and sent to the Public Security Bureau for strict custody. In addition, there are more than 50 teachers, students, and servants staying at the school, and special military and police personnel are assigned to guard and monitor them. The arrested people were transferred to the Anhui Northern Military Preparedness Command by the 2nd Cavalry Division, and they are temporarily detained in the Public Security Bureau. At about 11:00 a.m. on the 24th, Jiang Yangzheng, the chief of the military law office of the preparedness command, sent someone to the Public Security Bureau to bring all the Hou et al. to the headquarters. After investigation by the military judge Qu, Hou Mengxuan and Xie Juemin were released on bail, and Wang Baosheng and other eight people were still detained in the Public Security Bureau.

As for the Rural Normal School, the authorities have ordered it to be closed for vacation, and the teachers, students, and servants living in the school are allowed to return to their hometowns. However, to prevent unexpected events, the 2nd Cavalry Division and the Public Security Bureau are still sending military and police to the school to guard it. (December 25)</p>
<h3>Liang Guanying's Task in Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>To Discuss Bandit Suppression Plan with the Provincial Government</p>
<p>Liang Guanying, the commander-in-chief of the 25th Route Army, was ordered to lead his troops to Jiangbei to suppress bandits. A few days ago, he went from Qingjiang to Yangzhou to meet with Zhang Zhijiang, the pacification supervisor, to report on defense affairs. Yesterday (the 26th) morning, he came to the province from Yangzhou. Li Mingyang, the director of the Security Department, hosted him to rest in the Provincial Residence for a while, and then took a car to the Provincial Government to meet Chairman Ye to discuss specific methods for suppressing bandits. After more than an hour, he returned to the Provincial Residence with Ye for lunch. In the afternoon, Liang visited various department directors, and Chairman Ye hosted Liang and his entourage at a banquet in the Provincial Government in the evening. Liang and others stayed at the Dahua Hotel that night. I visited Liang at 11:00 p.m. last night, but Liang had already gone to bed. Secretary Liu and others received me. I asked Commander-in-Chief Liang what task he had in the province this time. Liu replied that he had discussed specific methods for suppressing bandits with Chairman Ye of the Provincial Government. I asked when Liang would return to Yangzhou, and he replied tomorrow. I asked if there would be any delays along the way, and he replied that he would inspect the troops along the way. I asked how Liang's troops were deployed, and he replied that the troops had been deployed on both sides of the Grand Canal. I asked if the cavalry team was suitable for suppressing bandits in Lixiahe, and he replied that the cavalry captain had a mortar team, and the cavalrymen could also fight like infantrymen after dismounting. I asked if the Lixiahe ports were intricate and if the cavalry team could also travel, and he replied that the cavalry team could be used west of the Grand Canal in the Xuhai area. I asked if Liang was going to Beijing, and he replied that he was not going. He must rush back to Qingjiangpu before New Year's Day next year.</p>
<h3>Russian Bandits Along the Harbin-Manzhouli Railway Line Eliminated</h3>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Harbin-Manzhouli Railway line of the East China Railway has been harassed by Russian bandits every day this year, and it was not until the middle of this month that it was eliminated. The White Russian bandit leader Zhu Guofu has fled to the Ganzhuer Temple in Inner Mongolia, and another bandit leader, Bie Shigeguofu, was killed by Cheng Zhiyuan's brigade. A group of Russian bandits with red ideology background who colluded with Soviet Russia retreated to Uligen on the border between China and Russia at the end of last month. The Harbin-Manzhouli line, which had been disturbed for a year, has temporarily stabilized. The collapse of the Russian bandits was due to the attack on the Xike and Yaokeshi stations on the western line by bandits in September this year. Su Bingwen, the brigade commander of the 15th Brigade of the Black Army, and Cheng Zhiyuan, the brigade commander of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade, were ordered to encircle and suppress them. Su and Cheng met in Hulunbuir and decided that the Russian bandits were rampant and scattered in Harbin, and specialized in harming the roadside stations with weak forces to hinder the traffic operation. It is appropriate to first deal with the Zhu Guofu group of White Russian bandits with all their strength. If the Zhu Guofu group is defeated, it will be easy to solve the others. They divided into three routes to suppress them. Tu Quansheng's regiment of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade entered the grassland to suppress Zhu Guofu, and the 38th regiment and the 43rd regiment of the 15th Brigade assisted each other. The 53rd regiment was used as a guerrilla force. Cheng Zhiyuan led the 4th regiment of cavalry from the brigade to enter Yalu and advanced to Shiwei, Sanhe, and Qigan to put pressure on a group of Russian bandits who colluded with Soviet Russia. After the departure of the three-way army, the Russian bandits fled and hid in the wild, with no place to avoid the cold, and because the wilderness was covered with snow, it was inconvenient to hide. In mid-November, Tu's regiment had killed more than a hundred Russian bandits. Zhu Guofu and his deputy leader Bie Shigeguofu were divided into two groups, Zhu fled to Hulun Lake, and Bie fled to the border of Shiwei. By the end of November, Tu's regiment chased Zhu's bandits to Hulun Lake, killing even more bandits, capturing more than 60 alive, and seizing countless guns and horses. Zhu Guofu only escaped with his life and fled to the Ganzhuer Temple area, wanting to flee to Outer Mongolia. Tu's regiment returned to Manzhouli on the 12th of this month and returned to its original defense. Brigade Commander Cheng led the 4th regiment and met the bandits several times between Yalu and Sanhe, and fought fiercely for many days. The bandits collapsed into small groups and fled to the Russian border. Their leader led more than a hundred people and retreated to Upper Ulik, leaving behind a lot of baggage and new Russian-style military equipment, all of which were captured by Cheng's brigade. On the 16th of this month, they met Bie Shigeguofu's group on the border of Shiwei. The gang was only seventy or eighty people, but they had no way to retreat, and they were still fighting like cornered beasts. After a day and night of fierce fighting, Cheng's brigade finally captured and beheaded Bie Shigeguofu. Except for more than 30 bandits who fled to Russia, all the rest were captured. (22nd)</p>

<p>Seven Families in Yuanhua District Robbed in One Night, Injuring Five or Six Owners. The Huangxiang, Shijiaqiao, and Jijiaqiao areas in Yuanhua District of this county are all along Huadang, with dense reeds and intricate ports. On this night, more than 20 bandits with mixed accents arrived, first going to Huang Yongzhen's house in Huangxiang, breaking the door with yellow stones, and swarming in. They first twisted Huang's wife, Jiang, tied her with ropes, forced her to tell them where the silver was hidden, and beat Jiang's head and body. Then they entered the room and searched at will. As a result, ornaments and cash of about 500 yuan were robbed. Fortunately, Yongzhen heard the news and escaped from the back roof, avoiding suffering. His sister-in-law, Lu, was also affected, losing 24 silver dollars, 6,000 cash, a pair of bracelets, 15 pieces of clothing, four scarves, and five buckets of white rice. The You family in Jijiaqiao was robbed of more than 200 silver dollars.

Because Wang Fusheng was involved in another case that was still under investigation in Shanghai, he could not be transferred for the time being. However, the other two robbers, Shen Caisheng and Qiang Fugou, were escorted back to Wuxi yesterday. Captain Xue interrogated them. Shen Caisheng confessed that the robbery and murder case at Yanjiadang, Nan Shuang Temple, was indeed committed by Wang Fusheng and others who gathered a crowd for robbery and shot the victim to death. Each of them received over two hundred yuan in stolen money. Qiang Fugou's confession was the same. After obtaining the confessions, Captain Xue immediately prepared a document and sent it to the Public Security Bureau for transfer to the county government for interrogation.</p>
<p>Important Meeting on Silk Industry Relief: Silk merchants from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai petitioned the government to issue 10 million yuan in public bonds to rescue the silk industry. After Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry approved it, he submitted it to the government, which appointed Vice Minister Zhang Shouyong of the Ministry of Finance to take charge. Upon appointment, Vice Minister Zhang convened a meeting of silk industry leaders from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai at the Central Bank in Shanghai the day before yesterday to discuss solutions. Representatives Qian Fenghao, He Bingruo, Xue Shou Xuan, Yang Yuchu, and Zhang Zizhen were present to discuss the matter in advance. Chairman Zhang, the Vice Minister of Finance, resolved: (1) The original bond amount of 10 million yuan has been changed to 7 million yuan, with 6 million yuan for immediate relief and 1 million yuan for fundamental solutions. The so-called immediate relief is to allocate funds to silk factories in various ports for urgent needs. The other 1 million yuan will be used to establish improved mulberry schools and breeding guidance centers as a fundamental solution. (2) Regarding the distribution of allocated bond funds, it was decided that (a) only those who have been operating since June 1 of this year are eligible to receive funds; (b) those who temporarily suspended operations due to the market downturn but have not dissolved or closed down are also eligible to receive funds; (c) those who have reported suspension of operations or dissolution due to poor business or are unable to resume operations are not eligible to receive funds. (3) The initial date for issuing the public bonds was set for New Year's Day of the 20th year of the Republic, but it still needs to be approved by the Executive Yuan and researched and revised by the Legislative Yuan. It is estimated that it cannot be done before March 1. It has been decided to issue receipts as early as January 5 and then exchange them after the bond certificates are printed, so as to implement relief to the silk market. After the above items were discussed, the representatives present believed that the government's plan to order silk factories in various ports to deliver 22,000 dan of raw silk before May of the 20th year of the Republic was a major disadvantage to the silk factories and could not be accepted. Vice Minister Zhang promised to report the situation to the government immediately and cancel this proposal.</p>

<h3>Yangzhong</h3>
<p>Resolution of Baojin Island School Rent: It is reported that the Baojin Island school field in Yangzhong has over 9,500 mu of land, which was originally jointly owned by the Zhenjiang and Yangzhong Education Bureaus and the Zhenjiang Middle School. In the past, the Yangzhong County Government appointed a rent collector, Wang Hou, to set up a bureau there to collect rent. All the revenue from the 18th year of the Republic was misappropriated by the former Director of Finance, Xi Fudan. After the Finance Bureau was abolished this year and the Finance Section was established in the county government, the three institutions repeatedly wanted to exercise their property rights and collect the rent themselves. They negotiated with the County Finance Section repeatedly but did not achieve their goal. The three institutions then each petitioned the Education and Finance Departments to implement the recovery. Recently, the two departments approved the request. However, the Finance Department instructed that the general education tax levied with the grain tax should still be collected and allocated by the county government. Seeing that the school rent problem had been resolved, the Zhenjiang County Education Bureau appointed Section Chief Xue Zhenglin, and the Zhenjiang Middle School appointed Han and others, who took a small boat to Yangzhong on the evening of the 24th. On the morning of the 25th, they met with Lu Rumo and Wang Shikun, representatives of the Yangzhong County Education Bureau, and went to the Yangzhong County Government to negotiate the handover with County Magistrate Xu. After a long debate, County Magistrate Xu finally agreed and agreed to implement the handover on the 27th of this month. It is generally hoped that this issue can be resolved from now on.</p>

<p>Important News in Education</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Education Issues a Notice to All Provinces and Cities to Review Transferred Cases in Detail</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Education issued a notice to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities, requiring them to review the transferred cases in detail in the future in order to improve administrative efficiency. According to the investigation, the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities often fail to review the various forms for the establishment or recordation of schools at all levels under their jurisdiction that should be transferred for verification in detail and submit them to the Ministry. In May of this year, the Ministry issued Instruction No. 475, notifying all departments and bureaus that all transferred forms should be sent to the Ministry for filing only after they have been reviewed and found to be correct. Recently, the Ministry has reviewed the transferred forms sent by various provinces and cities and found that some have been reviewed in detail and are correct, while others have errors and inconsistencies and have not been reviewed. In this situation, not only is there a failure to implement the Ministry's orders, but also there are repeated back-and-forth delays, and the procedures are repeated, which greatly hinders administrative efficiency. For this reason, the previous order is reiterated. In the future, all departments and bureaus should be responsible for reviewing the transferred forms. If there are any inconsistencies, the departments and bureaus should directly return them to the original sending agency and order them to be corrected. After re-verifying that there are no differences, they should be sent to the Ministry again. The forms returned by the Ministry for re-creation or the items ordered to be investigated by the Ministry should still be reviewed by the departments and bureaus and should not be transferred casually as a mere formality, so that the system will be clear and efficiency will be improved. In addition to issuing separate orders, this order is to inform the departments and bureaus to comply with it.</p>

<h3>Zhenru vs. Lingnan, Champions of the Chinese Football Association</h3>
<p>Baseball field at 3 p.m. today</p>
<p>Championship Final of the Chinese Character Group</p>
<p>Since the Chinese Football Association's Chinese Character Group (i.e., Group A) began competing, those who have been able to win every battle and be invincible are Zhenru and Lingnan. The two heroes will meet at the Chinese baseball field today at 3 p.m. There will definitely be a great battle to determine the honor of this championship. From a general point of view, it seems not difficult for Zhenru to control victory today. However, those familiar with Lingnan's inner workings believe that since Chen joined Lingnan, the spirit of the whole team has been excellent, and the practice has been even more diligent. They have fully prepared for today's battle. Victory or defeat is difficult to predict, but at least they can give Zhenru a fierce blow. Therefore, Zhenru should be very cautious in order to avoid any danger. Tickets are divided into two jiao and six jiao types, etc.</p>

<h3>Zhenru Tied British Navy</h3>
<p>A Score of Two to Two</p>
<p>Yesterday's Group A Match</p>
<p>丨Tong Rongwen's Two Contributions Created a Draw丨</p>
<p>The Zhenru Football Team played Group A against the British Navy at the Shen Garden Football Field again yesterday afternoon. At first, everyone thought that Zhenru would definitely win, but the result was a draw, a score of two to two. The reasons and a brief description are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhenru's Lineup is Different</p>
<p>Zhenru has been fighting great battles for days in a row and will not be able to overcome its fatigue. First, the Senior Cup, then the Group A match, and today they will go out to fight a strong enemy. For three consecutive days, they have to conserve their strength and rest a little. Yesterday, Zhuang Shihong and Lin Songfa did not play in the front streets and replaced them with Liang Shutang and Yang Baosen. Liang was not outstanding, and Yang was even worse, which caused a slight loss of contact. Luo Haiguang was replaced by Tong Rongwen. Therefore, Zhenru was extremely unhappy in the first half. In the second half, Chen Jiaqiu and Yang Baosen exchanged positions, and the momentum was greatly improved. Although Zhenru is in the training period and has not failed, it is already commendable. Their lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Liang Guanlian, Feng Yunyou, Jiang Shanjing, Liang Shutang, Chen Zhenhe, Chen Baosen</p>
<p>Chen Bingxiang, Tong Rongwen, Dai Linjing, Chen Jiaqiu, Chen Hongbao</p>
<p>The Navy Rallied Yesterday</p>
<p>Zhenru's lineup changed, and the Navy suddenly rallied yesterday, getting rid of the previous day's listlessness. This is also one reason for the draw. Haimen, the goalkeeper, was very calm. Smith's left defender was also good, and the center back and center forward were also very good. Therefore, they were able to give Zhenru a strong resistance and finally achieved a draw. Their lineup only changed the right wing, as follows:</p>
<p>Haimen, Smith, Cox, Ashmen, Robertson, Henston</p>
<p>Gore, Crawford, Huiai, Tuole, Ximeier</p>
<p>If They Don't Win, They Will Suffer Setbacks</p>
<p>Huaden served as the referee and whistled to start the game. The Navy attacked first. There was no achievement in attacking and defending. Chen Bingxiang went deep into the left, but his lone army was weak and returned in vain. Tong Rongwen advanced and was blocked by the enemy's defender. Dai Linjing advanced, and Chen Zhenhe chased and attacked, but it was caught by the goalkeeper. Mei Hongbao's corner kick was also invincible. Repeated attacks could not break through, which seemed to be a harbinger of a draw. The Navy also attacked frequently and was burdened by it. There were countless dangers, all of which were worried about Zhenru. As expected, if they don't win, they will lose. The enemy got a corner kick, from right to left. Looking back, the left-wing Gore jumped up and headed it in. Zhenru lost first, 25 minutes after the start of the game. Zhenru counterattacked and besieged three or four times, but still did not succeed. Only three minutes before the break, disaster struck again. The enemy's left wing passed the ball to the center forward, and then to the right side. The right inside forward captain Le Xu kicked the ball diagonally, and Liang Xiaowei went out of bounds. Unexpectedly, he touched the goalpost and went in. Zhenru was unfortunate and lost two goals.</p>
<p>A Header Recovers a Goal</p>
<p>The break was approaching, and everyone was very disappointed. God did not want Zhenru to lose. No more than a minute after the second goal was scored, Zhenru had a chance to advance greatly. Dai Center Forward passed the ball to Rong. Mei kicked it up and landed in front of the goal. Tong Rongwen raised his head and headed it in. Sure enough, he recovered half of it. The break time arrived, and the first half ended with a score of one to two.</p>
<p>Advance Again to Create a Tie</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, the enemy still attacked fiercely, and dangerous waves appeared from time to time. Fortunately, nothing happened. Chen Jiaqiu's foot was slightly injured, so he and Yang Heshen exchanged positions, and the momentum was better. The guards were also more effective. When they tried their best to counterattack, once Tong Rongwen got a pass and was already in front of the goal, he could have hit it himself. In a panic, he passed it to the right again, so he did not enter. It was a pity. After five minutes, the three armies advanced together, and the whole army used their lives and were determined to break the enemy. Chen Bingxiang took the corner kick, and the landing point was very good. Everyone competed in front of the goal. Tong Rongwen watched quietly, taking advantage of the enemy's chaos, and kicked it into the net, thus creating a tie. This was Tong's second contribution.</p>
<p>Fierce Attack Does Not Bring Success</p>
<p>Since the tie had been achieved, hope was born, in the hope of winning. In the next forty minutes, Zhenru did its best to advance, breaking through the enemy's gates repeatedly, but all stopped in front of the gate and returned. At one point, five people advanced to the front of the goal at the same time, and the enemy's formation was empty. The attack went in, but the replacement did not go in. Chen Zhenhe attacked fiercely and also fell outside the gate. There were many such cases, and Zhenru could not help but feel sorry. At the end of the game, the two teams still scored two goals each.</p>
<p>丨Xia Guang Works Hard to Defeat a Strong Enemy</p>
<p>The Xia Guang Team, in Group B-1, are co-leaders, and they are all known as always-winning troops. Last night's battle was related to the top honor of Group B-1. The fierceness of the battle can be imagined. Xia Guang's strength is indeed more superior, so in the overall situation, they always take the lead. It is a pity that the team's lineup has few changes, which is regrettable. The result was twenty-seven to twenty.</p>

<h3>The Founding Record of Libao Elementary School, by Pan An</h3>
<p>Libao Elementary School is located in Libao Town, the northeast township of Rugao County. The school building is tall and magnificent, standing above the mundane world. The painstaking management and hard work involved in its creation were considerable. At first, I was employed at Yangzheng School in the town and had rushed to help with the initial creation. Later, I wandered around, relying on Mr. Pan's arduous and outstanding efforts to complete it. Recently, I received a copy of his founding record, and I was deeply moved after reading it. I would like to introduce it to show the difficulty of the creation, so as to reveal the future. Bangdong knowledge,</p>
<p>Libao Elementary School was founded in the summer of the eleventh year of the Republic of China. At the beginning, it was a junior middle school. At that time, the Ministry promulgated the three-three system for middle schools and the four-two system for elementary schools. I was the second-generation teacher of the Jiangsu Provincial Normal School. The county education authorities asked me to prepare for the establishment of a junior middle school in the city. The construction and equipment costs were to be borne by the locals, and the operating expenses were to be borne by the county. Therefore, a middle school preparatory meeting was organized, with more than 30 attendees. Mr. Tang Baisheng was publicly elected as the preparatory leader. The city had no public funds, and there were private disputes nearby. The discussion was to complete it quickly. However, most of the people in the town did not know the importance of education. One or two wealthy families were especially waiting to see. In the hot sun, I followed the gentlemen to run around to solicit donations. Before the funds were collected, we first occupied the old site of Guanyin Temple and purchased the gap land to the southeast to start construction. Before the construction was completed, we first borrowed a house to enroll students and start school. All kinds of things were gathered together. I went out in the morning and returned at night, or did not have time to bathe for several days. In less than two months, three main gates, six rooms to the west of the gate, and one room each in the middle and rear, as well as the kitchen and other accessories, were completed one after another. The equipment and utensils were also well prepared. Suddenly, I received an order from the government to stop setting up the junior middle school. After a county education meeting, it was changed to an acting elementary school. Those who recognized the assets and contributed their efforts mostly retreated. Only more than 2,600 yuan was actually collected, and more than 4,300 yuan was actually spent. Baisheng owed more than 1,200 yuan, and I owed more than 400 yuan. The most powerful assistants were Zhong Shouqing, Zhu Zhusun, Feng Boji, Shen Yuzai, Yucheng, and Li Boliang, and then Zhang Zicheng's father and son, Ren Jinchen's brothers, and the rest cannot be counted one by one. This was the first phase. Later, Tang Hancai, at my request, donated 47 mu of inherited property in Pujiawan to the school, sold 18 mu, and also held a meeting to repay Baisheng's debt. The debt I owed was raised separately. The remaining land rent was presented to the county and set as the tuition fee for poor children in the town to go to school. In the two years of the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth years of the Republic of China, I was intent on repaying old debts and could not take care of the school. A school was set up in the west three rooms, and the area north of the main gate was all wilderness. In the fourteenth year, I dismantled nine rooms of Leizu Temple and seven old rooms and rebuilt five halls, six rooms to the east of the main gate, and four long and short corridors, costing more than 1,300 yuan. I was afraid of the difficulty of raising donations and strongly requested the county council and the city council for a subsidy of 1,020 yuan. If it was not enough, I raised it separately. Those who helped me were Zhu Zhusun and Ma Boji. This was the second phase. At this time, the school building was slightly impressive. Only the southeast of the auditorium was designated as Taiyang Nunnery. The house was dilapidated and did not meet the standards of a classroom. In the eighteenth year, I was the head of the city administration and used the public property recovered from the business to allocate more than 400 yuan, as well as the education bureau and the township people to help with the funds, and rebuilt five classrooms to the east of the auditorium, and built a storage room. This was the third phase. In summary, the above three phases took eight years, and the total amount of money used was more than 6,500 yuan. I have been accustomed to the hard work of the people. I only hope that I can hide its achievements from beginning to end. In the future, there will be more students. There is still room to build classrooms in the gap behind the auditorium. I hope that the local people with good intentions will do it. My intention is to ask the township party to advance more benevolent people, not necessarily those who are glorious. Everyone has their own ambitions. Choose the good and stick to it, not limited to education. The reason why things succeed is perseverance and perseverance. Doubt and slander are not enough to make it difficult. If future students know what to take from it and establish themselves, they will be able to use their sincerity to benefit the mulberry trees and their hometowns. It will not fail the hard work of the gentlemen's creation. Liu Xikun and Wang Jingmin, the principals of the buildings in the fourteenth and eighteenth years of the Republic of China, have worked hard in the management and are also known. Recorded by Pan Shusheng, a local in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Also, the couplet marking the completion of the school building懇禮堂 (Things are difficult to say one by one, take on grievances, the intentions of the comrades are also there) (I have thousands of words, saying quality and learning, later students work hard for it)</p>

<h3>Talking About the Intoxicated and Crazy Ping-Pong Enthusiast Wang Yan Jin</h3>
<p>I have read "Free Talk" for six years without a single day's break. Articles about tennis and football have been seen frequently. However, it is rare to see articles about ping-pong. Recently, ping-pong activities in Shanghai have surged. The popularity is unprecedented. Besides reading, I also enjoy it. I dare to record what I have seen and heard, and the experience I have gained. I hope ping-pong enthusiasts in the country can teach me.</p>
<p>The History of Ping-Pong Ping-pong was invented in England, according to my teacher, Mr. Mei Yisheng (MASON). The invention of ping-pong in 1887 was deduced from the principles of tennis. At that time, it was only popular in London. Later, it gradually spread throughout the country, from England to France to Germany, and throughout Europe. Its ability to become a popular sport in Europe goes without saying regarding its performance in the United States. I don't know if our Eastern nations also like it. The depth of their passion can be seen in Japan. Every year, there are hundreds of groups competing for trophies, and parks and hotels all have this facility for the public to practice. In Shanghai, it was only seen in schools, the YMCA, the Jiande Society, and other organizations. Now, all labor unions and families have this sport. Will the future development be limited? The Benefits of Ping-Pong Tennis and football are suitable for people with strong physiques. Ping-pong is not limited to strong or weak, men or women, old or young. Moreover, ping-pong is an indoor sport. Even if it rains or snows, it can still be played as usual. It does not hinder anything. The value of exercise is in daily persistence. Ping-pong</p>
<h3>Arhats Without Spiritual Power Drift Away with the Waves</h3>
<p>The Zhenjing Temple in our town (Pingtao) is one of the three national old-age homes for the Buddhist community. The scale is grand, and there are many ascetics. A certain monk, rich in assets, planned to sculpt five hundred Arhats, each a foot tall, for the temple at his own expense. So, this summer, he purchased high-quality wood and hired craftsmen to carve them. But there were two teams of sculptors, Team A and Team B, each carving half of the number. As soon as work started, the monk went to Putuo Mountain for a visit. He only returned a few days ago, and both teams of sculptors had already completed their work. However, Team A's technique was not refined, resulting in the two hundred and fifty Arhats they sculpted being quite inferior. As a result, the monk was displeased when he saw them and criticized Team A's foreman a lot. The foreman was impatient and short-tempered. After being reprimanded, he threw all the wooden figures he had carved into the Tiaoxi River in front of the temple. For a while, the ones floating, the ones sinking, the ones horizontal, and the ones vertical in the river were all the revered ones, almost cutting off the flow. Mockers said that these Arhats had no way to heaven but a door to the sea, and that their number was exactly two hundred and fifty, so it was fitting that they had no spiritual power and suffered drowning. When the Arhats were thrown into the water, the general monks in the temple all came to the riverbank. Some knelt down to see them off, some chanted scriptures with palms together, some clapped and laughed wildly, and some sighed looking up at the sky. The scene was colorful and quite a sight. The most ridiculous thing was that the revered ones went down the stream, and the residents along the stream were surprised when they saw it. So, they suspected ghosts and gods, and all sorts of rumors arose.</p>
<p>pong can be like this. I hope to summarize the benefits of ping-pong. It can not only circulate blood and increase vitality, but also bring great benefits to intelligence and psychology in an invisible way. This can only be understood by those who are personally involved.</p>
<p>One Gain from Ping-Pong My Start in Ping-Pong. Ten years ago, it was a pity that I stopped and started several times due to environmental reasons. So far, I have achieved nothing. Last winter, Mr. Xu Shoujian of China Public School and I initiated the organization of the Chengxing Ping-Pong Team in Baoshan Chengxi Park. The results have been good for a year. Our team has also made great efforts to promote ping-pong. Ping-pong should be popularized. Therefore, the public sports field and popular education hall in the county have added ping-pong rooms, and it is said that a county-wide individual championship will be held. The art of ping-pong is all about practice. With practice, you will become supernatural and reach a wonderful state. The changes in the ball include long ball, short ball, spin ball, draw ball, kill ball, fast ball, and press ball. There are also draw-kill balls, which are draw and kill balls, and fast-kill balls, which are fast and kill balls. When hitting a long ball, use more force and stay farther from the table. The opposite is true for short balls. Long balls are slow and more drawn. Short balls are fast and more pressed. Spin balls are divided into horizontal and vertical. For horizontal spin balls, the racket is placed horizontally and hit. The ball comes out slowly and forcefully. For vertical spin balls, the racket is upright and the ball comes out quickly and fiercely. A draw ball is used to draw up the opponent's ball and attack the opponent with great force. Kill balls are fast and press the opponent's ball. Fast balls are fast and used to defeat the incoming ball. Press balls are used to deal with high balls. However, summarizing the state of ping-pong combat, it is only divided into two types: attack and defense. Beginners should first learn to defend and then seek to attack, so that the effect can be faster.</p>
<h3>Recording a Useless Lawsuit for Loss of Items in a Hotel and Claim for Damages</h3>
<p>Mr. Lu, a famous lawyer in Shanghai, went to Suzhou last winter to handle an appeal case and stayed at the Dazhong Hotel in Xishan Chang Lane. At night, his leather robe, cotton coat, seal, etc., were stolen by a skilled thief. Lu searched and inquired with the hotel staff. The hotel staff did not respond with kind words, and even blamed him for being careless. The so-called "clothing and belongings, take care of them yourself. If there is any loss, it has nothing to do with the hall" and other irresponsible words were deeply imprinted in their minds, intending to silence the guests. Lu did not think so. He said that guests staying in the hotel cannot guard their belongings all night. The door is not strictly guarded, and thieves come in to steal. How can the hotel shirk its responsibility? Moreover, the hotel should be responsible for the damage or loss of items brought by guests. This is a natural principle of civil law. How can they shirk it? Lu said this to make the hotel clarify its responsibility and express considerable apology so that it could be settled. However, the hotel owner was a former section chief of a certain government office and had some influence in Suzhou City. He did not care about the law at all. At first, Lu angrily wrote a complaint and asked a lawyer friend to sue him in the Wuxian Local Court. The judge summoned, investigated, and debated. At the end of the trial, he suddenly ordered to reopen the debate and strongly advised mediation. It was delayed for a year. Recently, the lawyers of both parties signed a mediation agreement. Dazhong admitted to paying compensation, which Lu donated to the Hidden Poor Association in full. A lawsuit ended here. Calculating the expenses incurred by both parties, it was three times the amount of the initial compensation. Lawsuits will eventually lead to misfortune, and Dazhong initially failed to treat people with a friendly attitude, causing a small spark to start a prairie fire. Thinking about it afterwards, he could not help but smile wryly. The reporter heard about this incident at a banquet one day and recorded the facts to tell other hotels and travelers.</p>
<h3>Travelogue of the South Seas (114) Sacred Flower</h3>
<p>The Burmese are not very advanced in architecture. Not having a fixed residence is a common trait of tropical people. However, having a large tree in the tropics is like having a house. Small shops are set up under large trees. Originally, the house itself is the tree. Now, they are gradually using corrugated iron as roofs, but their houses are very hot in the middle of the day and often uninhabitable. They only know to use one layer of iron. They don't know to add another layer of wood. The Chinese are the same. This is a major drawback. Their houses are divided into three types: 1. A square thatched hut. 2. A wooden house with a corrugated iron roof. 3. A building with walls. Their shape is square. A large square house is for one family. Getting used to living there is also quite convenient. It is quite similar to Japanese wooden houses. Furthermore, in the Book of Poetry, the Qin Feng poem "A Woman Longing for Her Beloved" says, "Thinking of my lord, warm as jade. In that wooden house, my heart is troubled." Then, did people in the first era mostly use wooden houses?</p>
<p>The Burmese are compassionate and gentle and do not kill. The birds in various places are not afraid of people. They often come to the ground. They do not know to be surprised and avoid people. Sometimes women carry food on their heads. The birds then seize it from above and leave. I used to be in Taiyuan, and eagles often flew down from the sky to snatch things held in people's hands. The principle that one should not go to extremes is difficult to achieve. If people love things too much, then animals will encroach on people. Moreover, the pagodas are not very clean. Offering food to the Buddha is actually a place to feed the birds.</p>
<p>I have carefully observed that the physique of the Burmese is no different from that of the Chinese and Japanese. I have not yet been to Siam. I have heard that they are also no different from the Chinese. Generally speaking, from Burma to Japan, the physical structure of the people is the same. The race is uniform. However, there are only differences in customs, language, decoration, and religion. Once the decorations are removed, it is very difficult to distinguish them. Sometimes it is not easy to distinguish between Burmese, Chinese, and Japanese. However, if you add the Kalu people, the Indians, and the natives of the South Seas, then the race is different. For example, the natives have black skin and lots of hair. The Indians are tall with high noses and deep-set eyes. It can be proved that they are originally the same race as the whites. However, there are two things in Burma that have a close relationship with China. The race is the same, and the geography is close to Yunnan. One thing is half different from us. It is just the pure Buddhism of India. We have a part of India and our own culture. However, if the Jinsha River in Yunnan Tengyue flows south out of Burma, and flows down the Jinsha River straight to Yangon, it directly connects to the South Seas. It is also very convenient in the national era. I hope the people will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>There are very few British troops in Burma. The British are now paying attention not to Burma, but to the important passes outside Yunnan on the Chinese border. What the British fear most is the military movements on the Chinese border. There is no need for much defense inside Burma. However, important officials in various places are British. The Burmese hold the position of deputy and occasional scattered duties and servants.</p>
<h3>A New Swindle in Wuxi: Wu and Liu</h3>
<p>The world is deteriorating, and thieves are rising up. Even in cities with strict guards, several thefts occur every day. The peaceful and happy life of the people is no longer what it used to be. Moreover, new and strange scams are emerging endlessly due to the prosperity of modern science. Two swindlers came to the Wudi Magnesium Factory in Wuxi a few days ago. The following is a record of what happened.</p>
<p>On a certain day of the month, two young men in silk clothes and woolen hats, dressed luxuriously, came to the factory. One of them carried a medicine box and entered the factory under the pretext of practicing medicine, saying, "We are ordered to help the world by treating illnesses and giving medicine without taking a penny." At that time, the factory owner and employees were all out on business. Only the factory owner's wife, Ms. Wang Yongxia, and her two sons and daughters were in the factory. At that time, the lady was suffering from toothache. Her left face was swollen. The swindler approached and pretended to be surprised, saying, "Madam's physique is very weak, and in a few days, she will be in danger of life." The daughter, Zhiyun, was inexperienced and panicked when she heard this. She asked if there was any way to save her. The swindler said that he only needed to use a fire tube to draw out a little pus from the waist, and she would be fine. Moreover, they would treat the illness on behalf of the doctor and would not ask for a penny. After the illness was cured, she would thank them in the newspaper. While he was speaking, the fire tube had already been taken out of the box. Without waiting for the lady's permission, he pressed the tube on her waist. The lady was very angry. The swindler said with a smile, "Madam's illness will be cured soon. I have already injected a needle for you. Do you feel pain? The pus drawn out is in this cup." While speaking, he poured the pus from the fire tube into the cup to show the lady. Upon closer inspection, it looked like the hair oil that women use. She knew that they were not good people and gave them a few foreign coins. Unexpectedly, the swindler said, "The lady has been injected with a needle and must take ginseng pills to replenish her. Otherwise, if she is injected with a needle and not replenished, she will bleed non-stop and die." The lady deliberately asked which pharmacy she should buy these pills from. The swindler said that this was a secretly made product that was not available in pharmacies. While speaking, he took out eight white pills from the box and handed them to the lady, saying that each pill should cost eight yuan, but now they were selling them cheaply for six yuan, so eight pills cost a total of forty-eight yuan. At this point, the lady was sure that they were swindlers. She was shocked and angry. She said to the swindler, "Even if I need ginseng, I will never buy it from you. Please leave as soon as possible." The swindler knew that his plan had failed and became angry out of shame. He opened his eyes wide and said, "I don't charge for injections, and you don't want to pay for medicine?" He looked as if he was about to use force. The lady was very scared and planned to order the young master to call the police, but he was not around. Just when she was in danger, the young master led two policemen in. When the two swindlers saw the police, their fierce demeanor diminished slightly. However, they were very eloquent. They said to the policemen, "We are doctors, and there is a dispute over medical fees. It has nothing to do with you." When the lady heard this, she told the policemen, "You are responsible for guarding and watching over these two people." On the one hand, she told her son to call the doctor quickly. After a while, the doctor arrived. He questioned the swindlers sternly, asking what school they had graduated from or whom they had studied under, since they claimed to be doctors. The swindlers were dumbfounded and had nothing to say. The doctor took the so-called ginseng pill, broke it open, and saw that it was baking soda powder inside and a wax shell outside. He was very angry and wanted to send them to the medical association for punishment. The two swindlers began to beg for mercy in panic. The doctor refused. The lady persuaded the doctor to let them go since she had not suffered any losses. However, the fake medicine and fire tube were confiscated and handed over to the police to be destroyed so as not to harm others.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (3)(4)(4) Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter 16: Cui Xiu Diligently Asks for Words from the Teacher, The Heroic Woman Talks Boldly About War at a Brothel Banquet Later, old Master Xu passed the Imperial Examination and was appointed as a Magistrate, a position that was readily available in Shandong. It wasn't exactly a good post. But he came from a poor background and wasn't good at maneuvering, so the post he was appointed to wasn't a great one. He was content if he didn't lose money, which was better than making a living by teaching. After a few years, he was still penniless. He had tasted officialdom, but there was nothing particularly enjoyable about it. He was moved by the thought of autumn winds and perch, so he returned. He has now passed away, while the Wei brothers, Ziyi and Ziqian, gradually became prominent. Ziqian served as an official elsewhere, but Ziyi often stayed in Shanghai, working as a clerk and also running some business. They had a rich collection, and were close friends with Shi Guanping and others. There was also Sun Qilei, who was also a fellow villager of Zuo Shichen. He was a talented scholar in Wumen in his early years, but later came to Shanghai and made a living as a reporter. He was an old chief editor at an old newspaper, and was considered very experienced. He was also very easygoing, so both of them were invited. On that day, many guests arrived, but Sun Qilei had not yet arrived. Only a note came. It was a guest invitation from a house. On the back were two lines of sparse words, which read, "Just seated here, will arrive a bit late, please don't wait." At that time, there was a game of mahjong going on, and there were still two rounds to finish. Everyone said, "It doesn't matter if we wait a bit, we can all sit together at the table, it will be more lively." Before half an hour had passed, their game was finished, and they were about to sit down at the table when Sun Qilei hurriedly arrived. He said, "Have you not yet sat down? I was afraid that your feast here would be over, so I hurried over before finishing my seat there." He also said to Zuo Shichen, "Today, an old friend from Hankou came here and is hosting a banquet. Inadvertently, I met a great man. Who do you think this great man is? Try to guess." Zuo Shichen said, "How could I guess? Since the Wuchang Revolution of 1911, many great men have emerged. There are great great men and small great men. You have to give me a range before I can guess." Sun Qilei said, "This man is between a great great man and a small great man. If you say he is a great great man, he is not exactly someone with power after the revolution. If you say he is a small great man, but when you say his name, no one really doesn't know it. Everyone knows it. Like the Peking opera says, 'Speaking of this person, greatly famous.' I have heard of this person's great name for a long time, and today I am fortunate to meet him. It just so happened that his conversation was very lively, his mouth like a gushing river. Otherwise, I could have come here earlier. But his high-minded and eloquent arguments were unwilling to stop. The host introduced me as a newspaper reporter. When he heard this, he only spoke to me, as if the words he spoke could be immediately recorded and used as material for tomorrow's newspaper. Fortunately, another stranger came, and they were asking each other's names and exchanging pleasantries, so I took the opportunity to slip away."</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Markets in Dullness</h3>
<p>Slight Fluctuations Result in Downward Adjustments Yesterday, the Gold Exchange was open as usual. The situation of bid-up prices was abnormal and uncertain. Although there were no special major changes, there were still two or three rises and falls, and in the end, it fell slightly. With the foreign exchange rate stabilizing, the industry generally watched and waited. Because the end of the Lunar New Year was approaching, there were no major transactions in the market. For example, Taikang Run, Wanxing Shunli, etc., made purchases, while Yuanmao Yongxieyu, etc., sold positions. The overseas silver market on the 25th was slightly lower. There was no market between the previous and current day. At first, the gold market was still stable, but sellers seemed to be constantly increasing, and it suddenly turned downward, once falling to 660 taels with a fraction. Later, the buyers were excited and turned weakness into strength, surging to above 66 taels. However, people's hearts were unsettled, and they soon entered a precarious state. Afterwards, it returned to a state of withering and folding, outside 63 taels. In the afternoon, because it was Saturday and the market was closed, recalling the changes this week, it was not small, with a difference of 18 taels. The total core rose slightly by about two taels.</p>
<p>Low in the Morning, Higher Later Yesterday morning, the February opening price was 665 taels, slightly higher than the closing price by 5 qian. (The gross price was from 667 taels to 65 taels, and the sellers seemed to occupy the majority.) The 25th large strip was slightly lower by one-sixteenth, the silver price was reduced by one-quarter, and the private telegram was also reduced by one-sixteenth, to 267 taels. Because of the Christmas holiday, there was no market for two days. The US silver market did not see any continuation, so people's hearts were peaceful. However, Yuanmao Yongxieyu and others were selling vigorously, so it was suppressed by more than 4 taels, only accounting for 60 taels and 5 qian. The exchange rate was flat, and it was purchased by the Japanese Bank for one tael, four qian, one fen, one two five. Later, Taikang Run and others bought in, and it immediately appeared at the peak, immediately jumping up by more than three taels. The first announcement was at 63 taels and 89 qian, the quoted price was not changed, and then there was a slight up and down in the number of qian, around 4 taels. Suddenly, retail investors sold off, slightly less than one tael. At 9:40, it was 63 taels. Zhifeng Yong Taikang Run and others came to buy again, instantly increasing by more than 2 taels, rising to 65 taels and 78 qian in more than ten minutes. In an instant, it went downward. It seemed that British gold was loosening. Banks were mutually doing March 153125, and Yuanmao Yong and zero households also had more sales, so the price was difficult to support. From 10:00 to 11:00, it fell by several qian. However, there was a one tael fluctuation in between. Later, Zhifeng Yong, Wanxing, and goods came on the market and gradually showed a good situation. By 10:30, it reached 66 taels and 5 qian.</p>
<p>Sellers Swarmed, the Ending Was Exhausted Again The foreign exchange transactions were calm. Later, Xieyu Dadecheng and others sold one after another, and the buyer had already retreated. Therefore, it turned from sharp to withered. In less than half an hour, it had depreciated sharply by three taels and five or six qian, only accounting for 62 taels and 8 qian, and then added to three taels and eight or nine qian. The market almost became a revolving situation, which was difficult to handle. By the time the noon closing was calculated at 63 taels and 5 qian, it continued to fall by one tael compared to the 24th. The largest price in half a day was 66 and a half taels, and the smallest price was 60 taels and 5 qian, with a difference of 6 taels. The opening price of goods was 5 taels and 2 qian, and the closing price was 3 taels and 5 qian. The quoted price was still calculated at 691 taels and 2 qian, a discount of 278 taels. Later, the result of 28 taels was recorded at 61 taels to 64 taels, and the supplementary water was 61 taels.</p>
<p>The End of the Year is Urgent, Delivery is Watched The peer-to-peer transactions are normal. It is estimated that Zhifeng Yong Dadecheng and Yu Da are advancing and retreating, Yuanmao Yong, Xieyu, Hengyu, Yuantai, etc. have all sold. Bingxing first went out and then entered. Taikang Run, Shunli, Wanxing, and hedging are all entered. There are still various numbers of entries and exits, and there is no large amount. Dalian Bang bought more than 1,000 strips, and only 200-300 strips were sold. Guang Bang is still in a dull state.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Initially Stable, Then Frustrated</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was no telegram from the British Indian silver market, so the HSBC listed foreign exchange rates did not move either. Bank transactions were very idle. Because the New Year holiday was approaching, and the end of the year was related, the Chinese merchants were in a state of bystanders, and the market price was mostly peaceful. It seemed stable at first, and then slightly frustrated, but the ups and downs were minor. The gold market was said to be stable, but there were six taels of twists and turns, and in the end, it was slightly lower. When the noon</p>
<p>When the market closed, comparing the various exchanges with the closing before (24th), the British gold was reduced by 0.0625, and the US and Japanese exchanges were neither prosperous nor declining. Only Dalian Bang of Chinese merchants sold slightly, nearly 100,000 yuan of Dalian bills in the near term. The Japanese Bank absorbed slightly. British gold was only mutually operated by each bank for tens of thousands of pounds, and the US dollars were only one or two hundred thousand. In the afternoon, because it was Saturday, the market was closed.</p>
<p>The British exchange rate within the market only rose and fell by 0.0625. In the morning, the asking price for near and far terms was one shilling, five pence, two five, and the buying price was three one two five. Later, Anta and Huabi mutually traded 10,000 pounds in February, the price was three one two five. Sanjing and Meifeng paired up to do 10,000 pounds in March, the price was the same. The closing price at noon was still two five, and the buying price was three one two five.</p>
<p>The US exchange rate within the market only calculated 125 up and down. From the early morning opening, the asking price for near and far terms was 34 yuan, 9375, and the buying price was 35 yuan, 0625. Shanghai sold Zhejiang 50,000 yuan in January, the price was 35 yuan. Xingye Shanghai sold 100,000 yuan to Korea, the price was 35 yuan, 0625. Sanjing sold several yuan this month, the price was 35 yuan, which was a purchase by telegram from Little Luzon. The closing price at noon was 35 yuan, and the incoming price was 35 yuan, 125.</p>
<p>The Eastern exchange rate within the market had a slight difference. From the beginning of the early morning, the asking price for January was one tael, four qian, one fen, seven five, and for March, it was one tael, four qian, one fen, six two five. The buying price was reduced by half a point. Sumitomo Korea bought 200,000 yuan for January and the current term, the price was one tael, four qian, one fen, one two five. The closing price at noon was no different from the early market.</p>
<h3>The Weekend Money Market is Flat</h3>
<p>Completion of Transfer is Complicated</p>
<p>Yesterday, the opening and closing of banks and completion of transfers were extremely large. Because it was Saturday, only half a day of transactions were done. Various closings and transfers could not be investigated at one time. Only the early market opening price in the market was 7 qian, 2 fen, 4 li, 7 hao, half. The noon market was 7 qian, 2 fen, 5 li. The early market exchange bill payment was 1.36 million, and the noon market was 1.525 million. There were no transactions in banknotes in both markets.

Bank transactions were 700,000 in the early market and 800,000 in the noon market for inter-bank trading. As for the various silver dollar closings and transfers of banks, they are omitted because they could not be investigated. The early market for silver demolition was 6 fen, and the noon market was 3 fen. The header was still white. Small money houses traded more than 700,000 yuan, and the public single closings and transfers of money houses could not be calculated.

<h3>Special Changes in the Yarn Market Before the Holiday</h3>
<p>The yarn market is firm, mainly because the market will close for several days due to the end of the year. Moreover, the tax issue for factory production is not yet determined, causing uncertainty among people. Recently, sales of spot yarn have been brisk, leading to panic among small sellers. It is decided that business will be suspended for six days from tomorrow, reopening on the third, due to the year-end and New Year. Many fear that there may be large movements in spot yarn during these six days, and they are deeply concerned about significant changes. Therefore, general speculators can only cut their losses, resulting in a strong bullish trend. However, investigations reveal that experienced speculators are still selling at high prices. Overall, due to the large volume of spot yarn being sold, the inventory in Shanghai has slightly decreased, making it difficult to weaken the market temporarily. However, the inventory in various local areas has increased, and future progress will depend on the level of demand.</p>
<p>The forward market for yarn opened with the momentum still strong and a shortage of sellers. Prices for all months rose by 7-8 mace. The market conditions for the second and third rounds of trading remained tight, resulting in increases of 5-9 mace to 1 tael and 1 mace. The market sentiment remained strong in the afternoon. The second and third rounds of trading slightly decreased, but prices rose again at the close. Most speculators did not feel secure due to the market closure and wanted to square their positions. Near-term prices fell by 7 mace, while far-term prices rose by 26 mace. The trading volume in the forward market totaled 15,000 bales. The post-market report showed that Jifeng sold 750 bales, Heshen 500 bales, Tiancheng 2,250 bales, Dachangcheng 400 bales, Yichang 650 bales, Changfeng 1,050 bales, and Yiyu 1,100 bales. Daji bought 600 bales, Tongxing 500 bales, Guangfeng 800 bales, Changji 700 bales, Shenyu 650 bales, Tianchang 650 bales, Shengtai 1,300 bales, and Xincheng 1,800 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Closing prices for forward yarn, with increases/decreases and open interest: March 1471, up 12, 296,501; January 1445, up 02, 325,504; April 1484, 1525,900; February 145, 0835,700; May 1487, 118,400.</p>

<h3>Fierce Short Squeeze Discovered in the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>Hot Short Covering · · · Active Rise</p>
<p>Since the short squeeze in standard cotton yesterday, people's sentiment has been激動 (excited). The situation is outstanding. This morning, a dispute arose over standards, and the auction only started after two hours. The rising trend was intense. General small investors saw the environment as unfavorable and purchased at any price, leading to盘盘向上 (round after round of increases). However, the overseas cotton market remained sluggish, while the local market was extremely firm. This was due to the lack of smooth supply from Hankou and insufficient inventory, leading to a state of fear. However, once prices are high, the arrival of goods from various sources will be旺矣 (prosperous).</p>
<p>This Month's Standard Cotton Surges Four and a Half Mace, Hankou Standard Cotton Forward Market Opens. Although American Cotton Falls, the Atmosphere in the Market is Thick, and Buying is Sufficient. Prices for all rose two to three mace. In the afternoon, those who had profited sold, and those who had goods hedged, resulting in a fall of five fen to one mace. The transaction volume in the forward market was统计 (calculated) 42,100 dan. Check the sales of Jifeng 1,400 dan, Hengyi 2,100 dan, Gongtai 5,900 dan, Yichang 2,500 dan, Yuanda 2,200 dan, and the rest 1,000 dan.

<h3>Foreign Yarn and Cotton Report Another Downstream</h3>
<p>American cotton is weak, British Indian market is closed. Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to purchases by peers, but weakened due to weakness on Wall Street and profit-taking by bulls.

<h3>The Relationship Between American Cotton Supply and Price</h3>
<p>Mengqiuside News reports that J. A. TOUD, president of the Liverpool Commercial School and cotton industry advisor to the Egyptian government, published an article on the relationship between raw cotton supply and price. From August 1 to July 31 of the following year, the relationship between the supply of raw cotton and its price has recently become a topic of discussion in various countries, especially in the United States. However, the principle that supply dominates price is self-evident in economics. In the relative relationship between harvest price and consumption, raw cotton can be considered a typical commodity. The supply in a quarter is the sum of the harvest in that quarter and the inventory from the previous period, and that supply can determine the price in that quarter with little difference. There are two exceptions in the statistics below. One is the phenomenon that occurred in 1921-1922. During the same period, due to the impact of the general decline in commodity prices, although the supply in a quarter decreased relatively, cotton prices all plummeted. This downward trend kept pace with the general decline in commodity prices. The second is the situation of American cotton prices in the most recent two periods. Also because supply has decreased but cotton prices have continued to fall, some attribute this reason to the decline in general commodity prices. However, the degree of decline between the two is vastly different. It is not appropriate to consider this as the main reason. Another saying that attributes it to the inferior quality of American cotton is more well-founded. The government's recent cotton price control policy has repeatedly failed as an interference in prices. Its price is still dominated by supply, which cannot be ignored. Based on the above reasons, the average price of American cotton in 1930-31 is predicted to be 7.75 pence. It will soon be proven whether this statement is wrong. (The quantities listed in the table below are in thousands of bales weighing 478 pounds, and the prices are in pence.)</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Sales Slack and Falling</h3>
<p>Yujidun boats squeeze and break</p>
<p>Zhabei Yesterday, very few boats arrived from various groups, only about ten. The reason is that cargo ships are湧濟 (crowded) at Yujidun in Husi, causing交通 (traffic) to be阻 (blocked). However, the river has thick存度 (inventory). The buying气 (desire) from all parties is very呆 (sluggish). The sale of Northern粳 (japonica rice) is especially滞 (slow). High-quality goods are見疲 (seen as tired), and the corners are许 (allowed). Prices for medium grades all fell by two or three角 (dimes). The market condition is不振 (weak).

Now that the market is告軟 (admitting soft),出入 (arrivals and departures) are遂多 (becoming many). However, the market is約跌 (roughly fell) half a角 (dime) due to銷呆 (sluggish sales).</p>
<p>Yesterday, not many boats arrived from the river in Hunan. The sales場 (market) was平淡 (dull). Changbang白粳 (japonica rice)疲 (tired) from定 (stable).蘇同粳 (Suzhou Tong japonica rice)交易寥落 (transactions scarce), and各檔 (all grades)均小 (slightly lower) by一兩角 (one or two dimes)不等 (unequal).

The medium grade is見短角半 (seeing a short half a corner).</p>
<h3>客秈 (Guest indica rice) Street Sales Are Active Again</h3>

<h3>Factories are Vigorously Releasing 中之粉市 (Wheat Flour Market)</h3>

<h3>Wufu Ice Candy Lacks Inventory Due to Production Suspension in the Producing Area</h3>
<p>The Post-Market Trend is Bound to Rise Again</p>
<p>Xiamen Wufu Ice Candy Factory has stopped production to prepare for rest due to the upcoming Lunar New Year, so the source is decreasing day by day. Not many should be. The General Manager of Dalaihua Company here, considering that the winter sales of each gang in the Shanghai area are in full swing, fears that Wufu Ice will be out of stock after the factory stops work, so yesterday he contacted the Xiamen factory by telegram to resume work immediately and rush to ship to Shanghai to meet the needs of each gang. It is expected that more will be processed and shipped, and it is heard that the last batch of goods has already been装出 (loaded) from Xiamen, and the quantity is also small, and the raw materials are soaring, and the number plate is bound to increase again.</p>
<h3>After Tax Exemption on Silk and Tea, the Silk Transportation from Shanghai to Zhejiang is Smooth</h3>
<p>Silk in Shanghai is transported to Zhejiang and has been approved by the government for tax-free release. Recently, general silk weaving merchants have been asking the Wuxing Silk Weaving Association for certificates in order to transport stored silk to Zhejiang. In recent days, the number of yellow and white silks shipped from Shanghai to various parts of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou has been not weak. Yesterday, there were also forty pieces of white silk transported to Shixia and other places in Wuxing.</p>
<h3>The Tea Market is Dull</h3>
<p>The tea market in the foreign firms in this port has been dull recently. In the past few days,洋行 (foreign firms) have stopped辦公 (office), and the market has completely停頓 (stalled). Yesterday,怡和 (Yihe), 福時社 (Fushishe), 德等行 (German and other firms),略有 (slightly had)零星 (scattered)進胃 (appetite) for珍眉 (Zhenmei) and 珠茶 (Pearl tea), but the銷路 (sales) was不大 (not big), and the市價 (market price) is still low, and the市面 (market situation) is still difficult to認爲佳象 (recognize as a good image). The存底 (inventory) of祁寗 (Qining) and other紅茶 (black tea) is almost不多 (not much), but辦 (handled) in recent days has been無人問及 (no one asked about).</p>
<h3>The Seaweed Market Rebounds</h3>
<p>Due to the plentiful harvest of new goods and abundant supply of goods from various sources in each grade, all the merchants in Haidai were selling at a loss, and the market was easing. I recently heard that the producing markets of various places reported recovery. The inventory in Shanghai has also gradually thinned, and the market is also reinvigorated. Yesterday, the market sold Nemuro seaweed at 5 taels and 5 qian, Hamanaka at 5 taels and 3 qian, and Kawaji Kunashiri Thick Bank at 5 taels and 2 qian. Guizhuang 4 taels and 8 qian, Shoudu 4 taels and 6 qian, Maizoku 4 taels and 2 qian, Second 4 taels to 3 taels and 8 qian, Xianghan and other parties were very healthy in processing. If Sichuan and Jiangxi and other places activate the business, and the market has a potential to rise again, The cost of the seaweed silk was also tightened due to the rising price of raw materials in the market. The number board is now selling the Xiangguan high-grade goods at 8 taels and 8 qian, Yokohama goods at 7 taels and 5 qian, and Osaka goods at 7 taels and 2 qian. Those who are not willing to脱 (take off),</p>
<h3>Pitou Dong Pitou Trend is Very Strong</h3>

<h3>Hardware Dong White Iron Has Little Goods and Strong Prices</h3>
<p>Very few white iron goods arrived from the east, but various customer groups were rushing to buy New Year's goods, so the demand was very urgent. Therefore, in the past few days, transactions have reached a huge amount of six or seven thousand sheets. However, after the market goods were processed, it became more and more scarce. Moreover, the current eastern exchange rate is getting tighter every day, so the market price is increasing step by step. It is estimated that each sheet is sold for nine qian and five fen (6 chi) and one tael and one qian five fen (7 chi), which is two or three fen better than the previous market. However, if the foreign exchange rate still tends to rise in the future, then the standard may also see a situation of prices rising like the tide.</p>
<h3>The Nagel Has Doubled Compared With Last Year</h3>
<p>Nagel (i.e. nickel) is one of the most sold items in hardware, but because the cost is high, there are fewer people engaged in the same industry. In addition, various groups in Tianjin Tan have</p>
<p>Ordered, so there are not many people buying in Shanghai. Therefore, at present, there are few traders in the same industry who buy this. Therefore, almost all the categories in the market belong to the unpopular type. However, in the coming year, there will be fewer goods arriving, and the sales volume will be several times that of the past. Therefore, the supply is not enough to meet the demand, and people's hearts are very good. The standard is firm and beautiful. The current market is estimated at 163 taels per dan, which is almost one times higher than the estimate of 85.68 taels in the spring. The speed of price increase of this product also has some influence on the sharp fall in foreign exchange. It is heard that in the past three or four days, customers such as ordnance factories have purchased a total of 180-90 dan.</p>

<h3>Shigemitsu Met With Foreign Minister Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussing Sino-Japanese Nanjing Case Negotiations</p>
<p>Japanese Side Has Indicated Concessions</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Nanjing case negotiations have been repeatedly stalled due to the excessive amount of compensation demanded by the Japanese side and the lack of reliable evidence. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Aoi met with Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting at the Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai to continue discussions on the Sino-Japanese Nanjing case. Shigemitsu took his leave at 10:30. Foreign Minister Wang told our reporter yesterday that the Japanese ambassador came to discuss the Sino-Japanese Nanjing case. The Japanese side has indicated concessions, and both sides are willing to make every effort to resolve it as soon as possible. Whether it can be resolved within the year is still uncertain. The Japanese ambassador also briefly mentioned other pending issues between China and Japan, but did not mention the recovery of the Japanese concession in Hankou. Mo Hui left Moscow on the 22nd and is expected to arrive in Beijing in mid-next month. Furthermore, Wang visited Xiong Shihui at the Orthopedic Hospital around 9:00 AM yesterday and visited Yang Yongtai at Baolong Hospital at 4:00 PM. The date on which he will go to the International Radio Station to represent Chairman Jiang in a call with the Presidents of the United States and Germany has not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>Suspension of Jiangsu Business Tax</h3>
<p>Reply from Ministry of Finance to National Federation of Chambers of Commerce</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce previously received a letter from Jiangyin County stating that before the abolition of likin in Jiangsu Province, the business tax license registration was carried out without the approval of the Ministry of Finance. After forwarding the telegram to the National Government's Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday: "Your telegram is noted. This Ministry previously received a telegram from the Nanjing General Chamber of Commerce with the same information, requesting a temporary suspension of business registration. We have consulted with the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting them to report on the preparation of business tax and the collection and registration rules. Then, we received a reply stating that the business tax registration fee had been decided by the 352nd committee meeting of the government to change the original progress and temporarily not collect the tax due to the upcoming central government likin abolition. We have ordered the Department of Finance to comply accordingly. Therefore, we should inform the Chamber to notify accordingly." Sealed by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Abolition of Coal Tax on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>Additional Two-tenths Treasury Bond Surcharge Also Cancelled</p>
<p>Result of Coal Industry Representatives' Petition</p>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Association's petition representatives Lu Qisheng, Pan Yisan, and Wang Pingnan went to Beijing by night train on the 25th of this month to petition for the abolition of coal tax. According to Xinsheng News Agency in Beijing, Lu and others went to the Ministry of Finance to meet with Minister Song on the morning of the 26th and submitted a petition. After Minister Song reviewed it, he sent Director Jia Shiyi to meet them. After the coal industry representatives reported their intentions, they continued to ask whether the coal tax would be abolished simultaneously with other excessive taxes and levies on January 1st of the 20th year. Song replied that after the coal tax is collected by the mine, it can circulate throughout the country, and no more coal taxes of various names will be levied. The coal tax currently collected in Shanghai and other places can definitely be abolished at the same time as likin. The coal industry representatives also asked whether the two-tenths treasury bond surcharge collected under the coal tax this year would be abolished at the same time. Song replied that the two-tenths treasury bond surcharge collected with the tax would of course be abolished at the same time. Later, the coal industry representatives asked whether the petition could be approved within the national calendar year. Song replied that it could be approved within the year and stated that from January 1st of the 20th year, domestic coal will only have export tax, and foreign coal will only have import tax. The previous item of re-import tax on domestic coal will also be abolished. He hopes that domestic coal merchants will fully understand and pay special attention to the key points. Finally, the coal industry representatives left after their petition objective was achieved and decided to return to Shanghai today to report the progress.</p>
<h3>Xiong Shihui's Injury Gradually Improving</h3>
<p>Expected to Be Discharged After Three Months</p>
<p>Hands Can Recover and Will Not Be Disabled</p>
<p>Regarding Xiong Shihui's injury, doctors at the Orthopedic Hospital said yesterday that Xiong's spirit has gradually recovered recently. The head injury has completely healed. Today (i.e., yesterday) he began eating rice and meat dishes. The splints on his arms can be removed after two weeks, and the leg splints can be loosened after eight weeks. According to the test at 4:00 PM, his pulse was 72, his breathing was 18, and his body temperature was 97.8 degrees. It is expected that he will be discharged after three months. Both hands can fully recover and will not be disabled. However, it is still difficult to say at this time whether both feet can return to their original state. Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, Headquarters Secretary-General Shao Lizi, former Fujian Provincial Chairman Lin Sen, and Director of the Central Ordnance Department Pan Bin also visited Xiong's injury one after another yesterday. Duan Qirui, who is living in seclusion in Tianjin, specially sent Cao Junjingyuan from Tianjin to Shanghai. Yesterday, there was a handwritten comfort letter from Duan, instructing him to meet with Xiong and convey his regards. Xiong was very grateful. Cao Jun previously served as the Secretary of the Executive Government, Director of the Anhui Provincial Government Office, and Counselor of the Ministry of Interior. Since the dissolution of the government, he has lived in Tianjin, formed the Guofeng Society, and promoted elegance. He has been corresponding with Xiong in poetry, and their tacit understanding is deep. Today's meeting was extremely pleasant.</p>
<h3>Letter Requesting Crackdown on Unscrupulous Hotels in the Concessions</h3>
<p>Yingzhou and Haitongchun Deceiving Travelers</p>
<p>Yuan Liang Asks Jude to Intensify Crackdown</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Letter to the Public Concession's Chief Inspector Jude (Law No. 874): We hereby inform you that we have received a document from the Shanghai Municipal Government issuing an indictment by Yang Juchuan, Hong Shisheng, etc., against the Haitongchun Hotel on Yunnan Road for deceiving travelers. We are ordered to investigate and handle the matter. The original complaint of Yang Juchuan, etc., stated that on November 28th, they arrived in Zhenjiang from Wenzhou. When the ship landed in Shanghai, they were tricked by accomplices colluding with the Haitongchun Hotel on Yunnan Road into taking the hotel's welcoming car, claiming that the car fare was only 40 cents and the room rate was 40 cents per night, totaling 1.2 yuan, enough for one night's accommodation. Unexpectedly, the accomplice had malicious intentions. As soon as they arrived at the hotel, they colluded with more than a dozen people to extort 20 yuan for car fare and 2.8 yuan for room and board. The plaintiffs replied that they had agreed on 1.2 yuan, which was enough for accommodation. When they saw that the plaintiffs were unwilling to pay, they stripped the plaintiffs of their clothes. Seeing that they were no match for them, the plaintiffs, being new to Shanghai, were isolated and helpless. They were twisted and closed in the room, unable to move. They were forcibly searched, and 21 yuan were taken from them. Hong Shisheng's cotton robe was taken off and pawned, receiving 2 yuan, which was only returned to the plaintiffs in the form of 20 cents. The plaintiffs were like birds in a cage, their lives and deaths in their hands. They had to beg the waiter to use 20 cents to buy some snacks to fill their hunger and lie down until the next day, using their cotton quilts as travel expenses. Without the pawned luggage, the plight of the future was unimaginable. Thinking that under the blue and white flag, there is a hotel like a den of bandits, and a waiter like a jackal and a tiger. The plaintiffs only suffered for a moment, but future travelers will be harmed, and no one knows how it will end. Please investigate and punish them. There are many unscrupulous hotels in Shanghai located in the concessions. Previously, due to the case of the Yingzhou Hotel extorting traveler Chen Jian, we sent a letter to your office requesting an investigation and handling, and for other unscrupulous hotels to be strictly cracked down on record. Now, it is found that the travelers Yang Juchuan, etc., complained about the previous situation, and the Haitongchun Hotel also has similar incidents of deceiving travelers. Shanghai is a major commercial port, a place where Chinese and foreign merchants gather. If similar unscrupulous hotels are not strictly cracked down on and seriously investigated, Chinese and foreign travelers will inevitably suffer. Accordingly, we request your Chief Inspector to investigate and prosecute the case of Yang Juchuan, etc., accusing the Haitongchun Hotel on Yunnan Road of deceiving travelers. Please also investigate and handle the previous and current letters and strictly crack down on all unscrupulous hotels in the concessions to ensure the safety of Chinese and foreign travelers, and please reply. To maintain public friendship, addressed to Jude, Chief Inspector of the Shanghai Public Concession Police Department, Director Yuan Liang.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Pays Attention to Likin Abolition and New Tax Rates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, requesting that the abolition of likin from New Year's Day be effectively implemented, and proposed suggestions for the tax rates of the special consumption tax and business tax currently under discussion. It is reported that in addition to submitting to the Ministry of Finance, the Chamber of Commerce also telegraphed various provincial and municipal chambers of commerce, requesting them to make consistent proposals.</p>
<h3>Bankers' Association Letter to the Public Works Department</h3>
<p>Regarding Public Security Issues</p>
<p>Please Seek Relief Quickly</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bankers' Association's letter to the Public Works Department: We hereby inform you that in recent years, the public concession has seen a surge in banditry, with kidnapping cases occurring frequently. Although many cases have been solved, the bandits are still rampant. Recently, their activity has increased. According to newspaper reports, there have been no less than four or five cases, two of which have resulted in multiple deaths. The cruelty is truly shocking. The public concession is supposed to be a tightly guarded area, yet these bandits dare to roam freely, with insufficient respect for the law, and even commit murder. It can be said that they regard the police authorities of the concession as nothing. Given the large number of residents in the concession, if there is no fundamental solution to public security, the entire population will be in a state of panic, and there will never be a day of peace. The commercial position will inevitably be lost. In the past, various Shanghai groups have appealed to your department regarding this matter, more than once, but there has been no safe guarantee, resulting in the increasing spread of banditry. Our association, as one of the social groups, in order to learn from the past, boldly requests your department to fulfill its responsibilities, seek relief quickly, and effectively devise preventive and strict methods for apprehending bandits, and implement them to restore public security and stabilize the people's hearts. We eagerly look forward to it.</p>
<h3>Persuading Fellow Traders to Join Associations</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a letter to various trade associations yesterday, saying that on the 20th of this month, we received a letter from the Committee for the Maintenance of Trade Regulations of the various trade associations in the city, stating that the temporary representative conference on December 13th resolved to send a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau through the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that all trade members must join the trade association, and trade associations must join the Chamber of Commerce. We have recorded the case and informed you accordingly, hoping you will check and handle it. This was resolved at the 26th standing committee meeting of our association, to notify various trade associations to persuade fellow traders to join the association. We have recorded the case and informed you accordingly, hoping you will check and handle it.</p>
<h3>Customs Duties Will Be Exclusively Handled by the Central Bank</h3>
<p>The collection of various taxes and duties at the Jianghai Customs has always been handled by the Bank of China, which established a tax collection office within the Customs. Since the opening of the Central Bank, the tax collection affairs should be managed by the national bank. However, due to the initial establishment of the Central Bank, everything was not yet complete. Therefore, it formed a joint tax collection office with the Bank of China, signed a contract, and jointly managed it. The term of the previous contract will expire in February next year. The Ministry of Finance believes that the national treasury agency matters should be managed by the national bank and has ordered the China and Central Banks to comply. Later, President Zhang of the Bank of China stated that the contract period was about to expire, and it was not easy to hand over temporarily. It would be necessary to wait until the expiration of the contract in February next year to discuss whether or not to terminate the contract. He sent personnel to the Ministry of Finance to discuss the handover procedures. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance has decided to take it over and have the Central Bank handle it exclusively after the contract expires next year.</p>
<h3>Approval of the Special Regulations of the Red Cross Society</h3>
<p>Chapter and Rules Formulated by the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>Old Rules Remain Effective Until New Rules Are Promulgated</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society, as an international charitable organization, has always been directly managed by the central government, as is the case in various countries around the world. In the third year of the Republic, the Northern Government also issued an explicit document stating that it should be directly managed by the Ministry of Army and Navy and the Ministry of Interior. Recently, the Qingdao Municipal Government and other provincial and municipal governments have successively submitted requests to the Ministry of Interior, stating that the Society should be managed by the Regulations for the Supervision of Charitable Organizations. President Tan of the Yuan made an order to comply. President Wang Zhen and President Yu Hede of the Society then submitted a request to the National Government regarding the Society's position in the world, requesting that it be handled by the National Government in accordance with international law. The National Government ordered the Executive Yuan to submit it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Navy, Ministry of Military Administration, and Ministry of Health for review. As a result, it was stated that the establishment of the Society was based on treaties and had a position in the international community. The various matters handled by the Society were special matters for injured and sick soldiers of various warring countries and should not be treated in the same way as ordinary charitable organizations. It seemed appropriate to formulate special regulations for management, similar to those in Japan, in order to facilitate management. It was a proper method. Currently, local governments often have doubts about the management of the Society. It is proposed that your Yuan forward the request to the National Government and submit it to the Legislative Yuan to formulate Red Cross Society management laws and regulations for application. If these laws and regulations are approved for formulation, please specify in the articles that the establishment of the Red Cross Society should be submitted to the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Military Administration, Ministry of Navy, and Ministry of Health for approval and announcement to ensure prudence. With such regulations, management would be convenient, and it would also benefit the development of the Society. Once the newly formulated laws and regulations are promulgated, the Society will be ordered to reorganize according to the law to end the disputes permanently. Before the promulgation of these laws and regulations, the Society's affairs will still be handled according to the old rules. Whether this is appropriate, we hereby submit the original documents issued and a copy of the Japanese Red Cross Society regulations, etc., for your Yuan to review and forward for the sake of public convenience. Based on this, the Executive Yuan immediately submitted a request to the National Government for review. Later, the National Government issued an order for the Second Legislative Yuan to comply. From now on, the Regulations for the Supervision of Charitable Organizations cannot govern the Red Society.</p>
<h3>Wine Trade License Issue</h3>
<p>Trade Association Petition</p>
<p>Cancellation Effective on the Same Day</p>
<p>Li Guangzhen, Director of the Baijiu Excise Office, previously caused a strike by all wine merchants due to the addition of a time stamp on the license. As a result, Huang Zhenbo, Director of the Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Bureau of the Second District, ordered the cancellation, and the strike temporarily subsided. Recently, the office further stipulated that licenses could only be used on the day of issuance. The wine merchants believed that this limited the meaning of operation and requested the trade association to convene an emergency meeting to discuss the aftermath. The association specially held a general membership meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than 30 members of the association attended, and Zhang Guanshou was elected as chairman. The meeting was held as scheduled. The chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, and then the members spoke in succession. They all believed that the office's limitation on the license, which could only be used on the day of issuance, greatly hindered business. Fellow traders are located throughout Shanghai. Except for a few who opened in the South City, most are in the Public Concession, Xujiahui, Yangshupu, Qingyun Road, and the West Shanghai area. The farthest distance from the office is 20 miles. If the license can only be used on the day of issuance, it is not only inconsistent with the public sale regulations, but it is also tantamount to stopping the operation of most fellow traders in the morning. It was then resolved to elect representatives to petition the special commissioner, who should handle it according to the previous practice.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Held Executive Committee Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhu Wenqi Succeeds as Finance Director</p>
<p>Organization of Regulations Review Committee</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce held an executive committee temporary meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday. Committee members Ye Huijun, Pei Yunqing, Lu Fengzhu, Wang Yansong, Xu Ji[　], Luo Qinghua, and others attended. Chairman Wang Xiaolai first had Secretary Xue_sheng report on the New Year holiday and recess dates of the association, which had been resolved at the 26th standing committee meeting. The standing committee meeting on January 1st and the executive committee meeting on the 2nd will be suspended. The association will take a three-day holiday from the 1st to the 4th (note that the 4th is a Sunday). It was also decided to hold a New Year group worship ceremony at 10:00 AM on New Year's Day, notifying all executive committee members, chairmen of various trade associations, and all staff members to participate. The following items were discussed: (1) Discussion of Director Pei Yunqing of the Finance Department's resignation and proposal to have committee member Zhu Wenji succeed him. The resolution was passed. (2) Discussion of the proposal to form a Regulations Review Committee and a list of proposed committee members for public resolution. The case was submitted by the Committee for the Maintenance of Trade Regulations of various industries and was passed at the 26th standing committee meeting. The names of the proposed committee members are as follows: Luo Qinghua, Cheng Guichu, Zheng Chengqing, Mao Chunpu, Ye Jiaxing, Ge Liangqing, Zhuang Meitang, Yuan Hongjun, Zhang Dalian, Jiang Zhigang, Chen Songyuan, Zhang Hongsun, Zhu Wenqi, Ye Chunqiao, Cheng Youfu, Cai Yukun, Luo Zheng. The resolution was passed, and committee member Luo Qinghua was designated as the convener.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Construction Discussion Meeting Supplements Committee Vacancies</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Construction Discussion Committee of this city has been established for a year and a half since July last year. It has made many suggestions on the city's construction matters and has achieved remarkable results. It is learned that committee member Mr. Bei Songsun has submitted his resignation to go abroad for investigation, and Mr. Yu Fengbao has been vacant due to illness. The mayor has recently sent letters to Mr. Wu Kaixian and Mr. Fan Zhengbo to fill the vacancies. In addition, among the natural committee members, the three municipal government councilors also serve as secretary-general and director. Therefore, there are still three vacancies, which have also been filled by the mayor's letter to Mr. Zhou Jingzhai, Mr. Dong Xiujia, and Mr. Yu Fengshao yesterday. In addition to the fact that Committee Members Fan and Wu attended the 16th standing meeting on the 26th, Committee Members Zhou, Dong, and Yu will also attend and discuss at the next meeting.</p>
<h3>Zhuang Zhihuan Will Report on the Waterline Negotiation Process</h3>
<p>Zhuang Zhihuan, Director of the Telegraph Department of the Ministry of Communications, believes that the outside world does not understand the truth about the waterline negotiations and that there are many misunderstandings. It is suspected that it is currently planned to wait until the end of the waterline negotiations within a few days before making a concrete report on the process. (East China News Agency)</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Hearing that the public concession area is heavily guarded, the bandits dare to appear there, which is insufficient, and even commit murder. Under the broad daylight, it has reached this extreme. It can be asserted that the concession authorities treat those who are in charge of police affairs as nothing. However, the number of residents in the concession is the largest among other ports. If there is no fundamental public security strategy for a long time, the entire population will be at a loss, and there will never be a day of peace. It is inevitable that its commercial position will be lost. In the past, various Shanghai groups have appealed to your bureau regarding this matter, with verifiable cases more than once, but there has been no safe guarantee, resulting in the increasing spread of banditry. Our association, as one of the social groups, in order to learn from the past, boldly requests your bureau to fulfill its responsibilities, seek relief quickly, and effectively devise preventive and strict methods for apprehending bandits, and implement them to restore public security and stabilize the people's hearts. We eagerly look forward to it.</p>
<h3>Along the Longhai Railway, Various Shipping Companies Compete to Load Northwest Goods</h3>
<p>The Tonghua Incident Remains Unresolved</p>
<p>The Longhai Railway is now fully open, and goods accumulated in the northwestern provinces and Henan are being continuously shipped. A mountain of goods is stockpiled in the Haizhou area, and shipping companies in Shanghai are competing to send ships to connect. However, crew members of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Tongshan" ship at Qingkou are still detained and negotiations are underway. The following is a record of news heard yesterday, divided as follows:</p>
<p>New Regular Northern Routes to Shanghai are Operating. Only the Hezhong, Dazhen, and China Merchants Steam Navigation Companies operate regular routes to Haizhou. Now that the Longhai Railway is open, and many military-requisitioned vehicles have been returned, goods from Shaanxi, Gansu, and Henan are pouring southward. Zheng Xiaosan of the Northern Navigation Company has specially opened a new route in Haizhou, assigning four ships, Beihua, Beichang, Beijin, etc., to operate to Haizhou, specifically to load miscellaneous grains and soybeans to Shanghai. Hao Ruiting of the Yu Da Steamship Company has also decided to open a route from Haizhou, assigning the Yu Lian, Yu Ji, etc., to operate. The Shanghai route has suddenly seen prosperity, with six companies currently operating ships, exceeding 100,000 tons.</p>
<p>Land-Sea Joint Transportation: The Dazhen Company is building a railway spur line on the Longhai Railway, connecting to the Dapu Wharf, which is nearing completion. The company's land-sea joint transportation has been agreed upon with the railway bureau and will begin implementation starting in January.</p>
<p>The Tonghua Incident Remains Unresolved: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Tongshan" ship was involved in a conflict in Haizhou where workers beat sailors. As a result, sailors were removed, crew members were arrested, and a strike wave ensued. This was previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the company received a report from the Haizhou manager stating that the Tonghua conflict started when laborers tried to seize food, which the sailors refused, leading to a mutual beating. Six sailors on the ship were injured by the laborers, and eight laborers were also injured, but none were in life-threatening conditions. On the 24th, the local manager mediated and agreed to resume work. However, after incitement by the labor union, claiming that they had filed a lawsuit with Ganyu County and should not be bullied by outside sailors, the strike continued. The crew members were arrested by the county police in the Sanyang area. The stoker and sailor headmen are still being held and have not been released. The workers are still on strike, and the ship is being blocked, resulting in huge losses. The company has further telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government to order the county to release them quickly, and a reply may be received today.</p>
<p>The Labor Union Provides Assistance: Regarding the beating of the Tonghua sailors, the Shanghai Seamen's Industrial Joint Association sent a telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Provincial Party Headquarters, the Ganyu County Magistrate, and the County Party Headquarters yesterday. It stated that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tonghua ship arrived at Qingkou, Ganyu County, where dockworkers boarded the ship and forcibly entered the kitchen to seize food. The numbers of laborers were numerous, and the cook was unable to stop them, so he shouted loudly. The sailor headman heard the noise and went to help, working together to stop them. However, the dockworkers were dissatisfied and, holding cargo bars and wooden sticks, swarmed onto the ship, beating everyone. The sailors and stokers on the ship were forced to defend themselves under this violence, resulting in many being injured by the dockworkers. Instead, the stoker and sailor headmen, as well as the cook, were kidnapped ashore and falsely reported to the county government, claiming that the ship had privately hidden repeating rifles, leading to their detention. First Mate Zhang Zongyi, Second Mate Ye Jin, stoker headman Hua Aqiao, and sailor headman Li Aqiao were arrested. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's ships have never had defensive firearms, and this is a false accusation. Moreover, the troublemakers were dockworkers, and the fault lies with them. A telegram was sent to request the immediate release of those arrested and to punish the wrongdoers as a warning. The telegram was urgent. Respectfully, The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Industrial Joint Association.</p>
<h3>Record of the National Coal Production and Sales Welcome Meeting</h3>
<p>The National Coal Production and Sales Joint Association held a meeting yesterday afternoon to welcome Mr. Hong Yanbin. Those who attended included Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Sun Meitang, Fang Jiaobo, Zhang Xinfu, Sheng Pihua, Liu Yumen, Yu Shunqing, Xu Wusun, and over fifty others. A tea party was also held to discuss three points: (1) Expanding the association's site; (2) Raising funds; (3) Planning detailed rules for various departments. The meeting adjourned after 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Petition of Two Bondholder Groups</h3>
<p>Before Representatives Proceed to Beijing</p>
<p>Petitioning Chairman Jiang's Shanghai Residence</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Holders of Central Bank Temporary Exchange Certificates and National Government Ministry of Finance Treasury Certificates has repeatedly extended the registration period due to transportation difficulties in other provinces, hoping to be comprehensive and avoid exclusion. Now that Chairman Jiang has returned to Beijing, the association's petition representatives have decided to proceed to Beijing in early January next year to personally present everything to Chairman Jiang, requesting early redemption to alleviate the suffering of the bondholders. All registration of bondholders will end at the end of this year and will not be extended again. It is reported that the total amount of temporary exchange certificates issued by the Central Bank was 5 million yuan. However, the Jiangxi Provincial Government had already recovered 3 million yuan from various counties in the province between 1927 and 1928. Therefore, only 2 million yuan are now scattered among the people in various places, and there are inevitable losses due to fire, water, theft, etc., so the actual amount is less than 2 million yuan. As of yesterday, the amount registered with the association was still less than one million, a small amount, so the request for full redemption as soon as possible may achieve its purpose. The situation with Treasury Certificates is similar. The association's petition representatives have not yet been officially designated. The association heard yesterday that Chairman Jiang was coming to Shanghai and planned to recommend Mr. Wu and others to first go to Jiang's residence nearby to petition.</p>
<h3>Chinese Merchants' Factory Association Supports Imposing a Tobacco Tax to Help Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Trade Association, based on a proposal by Committee Member Wu Zhihao and others from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, proposed to impose an additional 30% tax on the newly revised unified cigarette tax, which could generate more than 60 million yuan annually, as a disaster relief bond fund to aid disaster victims in various provinces. After discussion and resolution, it was submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation, and a letter was sent to the Cigarette Factory Association for endorsement. The association immediately held a meeting to discuss, and it was unanimously agreed that the matter concerned disaster relief and should be strongly supported. They should also seek rapid progress to achieve results. A letter was sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, which stated, "Regarding your association's letter, it was reported that our association's executive committee members Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Wu Zhihao, Fang Jiaobo, Ye Huijun, Gu Xinyi, Luo Qinghua, Zhu Wenqi, and supervisory committee members Kai Lanting, Lu Qisheng, and Chen Songyuan proposed that they were seeing the devastating disaster situation across the country, with Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Liaoning, Ningxia, and other provinces being heavily affected areas, and cries of distress everywhere. The strong scattered in all directions, and the old and weak turned to ditches and gullies, digging grass and peeling trees to fill their hunger. Women sold their children to survive, with no seeds left, and spring plowing hopeless, with starvation and cold, and corpses filling the fields. If immediate relief is not provided, they will all perish together. Even if they are lucky enough to survive, they will inevitably resort to desperate measures, which has a major impact on people's livelihoods and social order. The following methods are proposed: Immediate measures: (1) Send telegrams to chambers of commerce in provinces and counties across the country, uniting various organizations to form disaster relief associations; (2) Send telegrams to overseas Chinese chambers of commerce to solicit donations. Fundamental measures: (1) Submit to the National Government and all relevant departments, allocating a certain amount as a fund to issue disaster relief bonds. Considering that cigarettes account for more than 23 million yuan in sales nationwide annually, it is proposed to add 30% to the new cigarette tax quota, which would increase tax revenue by approximately 60 million yuan annually. The government can use this revenue as a fund to issue disaster relief bonds and implement the Three Principles of the People of the Prime Minister to save compatriots in disaster areas across the country. The cigarette tax rates in various countries, such as the British tobacco industry, are taxed at three shillings per pound, and American cigarettes are taxed at three US dollars per thousand, which is roughly equivalent to 200% of the value. Japan has the highest rate at 350% of the value. Adding 30% to our country's newly revised cigarette tax is still far from the rates of other countries. Moreover, cigarette taxes, on the surface, increase tax rates, but in reality, they control consumption and improve people's livelihoods. Taking its tax revenue to save disaster victims is truly a win-win situation. If the disaster area recovers and the local area is stable, this fund can also be used for disaster prevention construction and industrial education. It is also suggested that the National Government, when discussing the increase in cigarette tax, should pay attention to the difficulties of Chinese cigarette factories and provide protection, and formulate reward measures to promote domestic goods." On the 17th of this month, at the ninth executive committee and fifth supervisory committee joint meeting of our association, it was proposed that the disaster areas in various provinces were too wide, and the disaster relief funds obtained from solicitation were merely a drop in the bucket, and could not truly help the hungry people. Recently, although the Shaanxi disaster relief had issued 8 million in bonds by the National Government, it was reported that the actual funds raised were only about 300,000 yuan, proving that if large-scale disaster relief is desired at this time, so that the hungry people can all benefit, then besides issuing a large amount of bonds with a reliable guarantee, it would be difficult to respond to a large amount of disaster relief funds, which would be like trying to satisfy hunger with a painting of a cake. Looking at cigarettes, and comparing them with the cigarette tax rates commonly used in Europe, America, and Japan, our country's current new cigarette tax indeed has room for increase. It was resolved to report the situation to the Ministry of Finance, asking it to follow suit. If there are obstacles to issuing other bonds, or to allocate a certain amount from the increased cigarette tax for disaster relief, to secure a certain amount from the increased cigarette tax for disaster relief or from the treasury bonds issued, it was decided to allocate a portion for disaster relief. In addition to submitting to the Ministry of Finance for handling, a corresponding record was made and sent to your association for your information. Upon approval, it was discussed that the matter concerned disaster relief and should be supported, and rapid progress should be sought to achieve results. We should follow your association and jointly plan progress, etc. A special reply letter is hereby sent, respectfully requesting your examination and handling.</p>
<h3>The Chinese and Foreign Relief Association Strives to Save the Northwest from Terrible Disasters</h3>
<p>Shaanxi Relief Was Originally Expected to Conclude This Winter, But Unfortunately, the Northwest Was Engulfed in Warfare Again, So That Those Who Survived the Disaster Are Still in Desperate Circumstances. The Northern Lands Are Cold, When the Year Comes to an End. It Is Sincerely Feared That the Disaster Victims in Various Parts of Henan and Shaanxi Will Not Die of Hunger But Will Die of Cold. Therefore, the Association Has No Choice But To Exert Its Efforts To Provide a Final Subsidy. In Addition to Henan Province, It Has Raised Funds to Assist with Winter Relief Efforts in Various Places. It Is Reported That It Continues to Operate Shelters in Shaanxi Province, Focusing on Caring For Orphans and Poor Disaster-Stricken Children. It Plans to Strive to Raise Funds Until the Wheat Harvest Next Year. It Has Been Decided to First Remit Ten Thousand Yuan. Concerned About the Long Time Span and Lack of Funds, It Was Fortunately Met by the Shanghai Shaanxi Disaster Relief Association, Which, In Addition to the Previous Donation of Fifty Thousand Yuan, Has Now Handed Over All of the Remaining Funds of Over One Thousand Two Hundred Yuan, Which Has Been Remitted to the Disaster Area by the Association. It Can Truly Be Said That It Is Providing Charcoal in the Snow. If All Sectors Care About the Helpless in the Northwest, At the Critical Juncture of Life and Death, Even If Efforts Are Limited, and The Effect of Saving Lives Is Even Greater.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of the Jisheng Association's Shaanxi Relief</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association recently received a telegram from Mr. Luo Hefu and Mr. Dai Zhenshan of the Xi'an branch, informing the association that the porridge factory established by the association in Wugong County is now located in the towns of Dongjue, Fengzhen, and Zhenyuan. Du Chengzhi is the director of the Dongfufeng porridge factory, Guan Liang is Han Xun, Du Zixin is the director of the Zhenyuan town porridge factory, Guan Liang is Yang Shutang, Li Yude is the director of the Youfeng Weigong town porridge factory, and Guan Liang is Zhang Zi Kuan. Wang Jishi is the general supervisor of the three factories, preparing daily and decadal reports to be reported on schedule. Currently, over 10,000 people are receiving porridge daily. Speaking of the severity of the disaster in the entire county and the large number of disaster victims, at the minimum, another factory must be added to save the lives of some people. At this time, the cold wind is piercing, the disaster victims have no clothes to cover their bodies, and due to the lack of fuel, they are tearing down houses to make do. Major problems have arisen in clothing, food, and shelter, and those who have frozen to death are unknown. All schools in the county are completely closed, but only the disaster-stricken children's education and care center run by the association still has the sound of reading. It is known that the headquarters is providing relief to various provinces and is experiencing economic difficulties, so it is hoped that it will strive to add another factory, etc. It is said that after receiving the telegram, the association, due to the severity of the disaster in the area, should add another factory for relief, but it is currently jointly handling emergency relief in Jiangxi with the Moral Society, and its economic capacity is quite difficult.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Charity Group Adds a New Porridge Factory</h3>
<p>The Zhabei Charity Group distributes porridge at the Taiyang Temple porridge factory every winter. The crowd of diners is very crowded. Last winter, directors such as Du Yuesheng and Zhang Xiaolin visited the factory and witnessed the situation of scrambling for food. They discussed adding a new factory. This year, due to the closure of silk factories, the livelihood of laborers is even more difficult, and the number of people waiting to be fed can be imagined. Wang Binyan, the director of the group, accepted the proposal of the two directors, Du and Zhang, to set up a new factory at the Zhoujia Bridge in addition to the original porridge factory at Taiyang Temple. It has been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval and is currently actively setting up equipment. The two directors, Du and Zhang, have already purchased 300 shi of white rice, and as soon as the construction is completed, they can start distributing porridge.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Bureau Will Take Over the Port Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Port Affairs Bureau has been ordered to be abolished, all matters of the bureau will be taken over by the relevant bureaus of this city. It is reported that the Public Works Bureau has decided to take over the Nanshi Wharf Management Office and the Wusong Sand Dredging Registration Office of the bureau on the 29th of this month. After taking over, the bureau plans to rename the wharf management office as the Shanghai Municipal Wharf Warehouse Management Office, which has been submitted to the municipal government for approval. As for the Wusong Sand Dredging Registration Office, it has been approved by the municipal government to be renamed the Wusong Shipping Office. As for the original staff of the Municipal Port Affairs Bureau, it is planned to reassign some of them depending on the expenses after the takeover, in order to retain skilled personnel.</p>
<h3>Candle Industry Workers Request Revision of Treatment</h3>
<p>The workers in the candle manufacturing industry in this city, in view of the need to revise the treatment conditions agreed upon by labor and management in 1927, passed a resolution at a general meeting to submit ten articles to the Civil Training Committee of the Municipal Party Department for review. The review has been completed, and the most important one is Article 3, which states that after apprentices complete their apprenticeship, wages should be increased by two yuan per month annually. Article 5 states that workers' wages should be increased by 30% on the original amount, round-trip travel expenses should be increased by four yuan, and monthly regulations should be increased by one yuan. The labor union has prepared a document and submitted it to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for handling according to law. It is reported that the bureau has approved to convene labor and management within the year to conduct training and mediation.</p>

<h3>French Concession Police Ban Reactionary Tabloids</h3>
<p>A Total of Forty Types</p>
<p>Mr. Sally, the Minister of Governance of the French Concession Police, has recently discovered that there are many tabloids within the concession, and the content contains many reactionary articles. Although notices have been repeatedly issued to ban their sale, the number has continued to increase. Yesterday, he specifically compiled a list of the names of the newspapers and ordered the political department to inform all detectives to investigate and seize them. Four people must also be specially assigned to patrol various places every day. Anyone who is found selling one of the following newspapers will have all the newspapers and the seller arrested and taken to the police station. The name, age, and place of origin of the seller will be recorded, and then the newspapers will be confiscated and the person released. If it is a repeated offense, they must be sent to the court for punishment. The names of the banned newspapers are listed below, including Soviet Pictorial, Hard News, Shanghai Daily News, China Morning Post, October Review, National Society Member, Great Evening News, Old Shanghai, Maritime Daily, World Economy, Iron News, Steel Scraps, Red Seaman, Red Flag Daily, Secret Youth, Revolutionary Worker, Quick Knife Daily, Daily News, North China Evening News, Sea Light Daily, War Drum, Shanghai News, Little Shanghai News, Da News, People's Voice Weekly, National Daily, Warrior Daily, Rising Sun Daily, Review Weekly, Shanghai Worker, Oriental Daily, Great Wind Daily, Spring and Autumn War News, Asahi Shimbun, Revolutionary Daily, Wuchang Revolution, Poor Man, Big and Small News, Mopuer, Shanghai River Daily, and so on, a total of forty types. It is also required to arrest three cases every day.</p>
<h3>The Large Number of Crimes in the Concession</h3>
<p>Fei Zhudun Blames Chinese Residents</p>
<p>Saying That Failure to Report Crimes Is Clear Evidence</p>
<p>The Ta Mei Evening News reported that the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau, requesting it to do its best to suppress recent heavy robbery cases that have been frequently reported. Today (27th), Fei Zhudun, the Director-General of the Public Works Bureau, stated that the Public Concession Police Force is no less than that of any metropolis in the world. Chinese residents should be blamed for the rampant bandits, because these people have failed to fully cooperate with the police in reporting crimes, and sometimes they do not cooperate at all. For example, wealthy merchants and businessmen often do not report kidnappings or threatening letters to the police. Moreover, kidnapping cases are common every year at the end of the year. The police are currently paying close attention to winter prevention. It is impossible to station a police officer in front of every Chinese household.</p>
<h3>Another Eighteen Bandits Captured</h3>
<p>Two Released Due to Lack of Connection</p>
<p>Four Released on Bail Due to Minor Involvement</p>
<p>Total of Thirty-Four Captured So Far</p>
<p>Lu Shaotang, a Suzhou native who made his fortune by speculating in land, was kidnapped last year but escaped. Consequently, he hired Russian bodyguards and carried weapons for protection. However, on the afternoon of the 19th of this month, at 6 PM, he was kidnapped again while traveling by car to visit friends on his way home. One of the Russian bodyguards was killed. The ferocity of the bandits is truly frightening. Afterwards, the police authorities, considering that this case occurred in a most prosperous area, indicating the extreme audacity of the bandits, strictly ordered the police personnel under their jurisdiction to solve the case within a limited time. As a result, both Chinese and foreign detectives were actively investigating. Before long, they discovered the location of the bandit hideout. Led by Chief Detective Lu Liankui, the detectives secretly went to rescue the hostage and successively apprehended eighteen men and women. Except for a ten-year-old girl, who was ordered by the Special District Court to be temporarily cared for by the Women and Children Relief Association, the rest were detained separately.</p>
<p>As previously reported in this newspaper, the case is still under investigation, so the details of the capture have not been disclosed in the newspapers. Since the police apprehended the suspects in the French Concession at 414 Route Lafayette, 55 Rue Haig, and the hideout on Hart Road, they feared that accomplices might still go to these three locations. Therefore, several Chinese and foreign detectives were specially assigned to guard each location. As expected, many people from outside broke in over the past few days and were arrested by the stationed detectives. As of last night, eighteen men had been captured. This morning, they were sent to the Special District Court. After Judge Xu questioned them one by one, the police lawyer Ru Baoyi requested that Bao Jinshi and Sun Shimin be released because no connection was found. Therefore, the two were first released. Chen Jinghua, Li Ligeng, Li Rulin, Zhang Shaonan, and others were granted bail of 500 yuan each in cash or shop guarantee because their involvement was relatively minor. The remaining twelve were ordered to be taken back to the police station for detention and will be tried jointly with the previously captured suspects at a later date. Since the incident occurred, only ten days have passed, and two arrests have already been made. Excluding those released, there have been thirty-four people captured, which is the fastest case solved in recent times.</p>
<h3>Six Pirates Captured Alive Outside Wusong Estuary</h3>
<p>Pirates Attempted to Loot Matang</p>
<p>But Were Repelled by Police and Militia</p>
<p>At Matang Port outside Wusong Estuary, at about 9 PM the night before last, a pirate ship suddenly arrived, carrying more than thirty pirates. They immediately landed at the port, hoping to loot. After the police and militia received the news, they dispatched a team to encircle them. One pirate opened fire in resistance, but quickly collapsed and fled. The police and militia took advantage of the victory to pursue them and captured six pirates on the spot: Ge Jinhua, Hu Quan, Zhuo Qin Huai, Yu Jinsheng, and Shi Chengdao. The rest escaped onto the pirate ship and fled. They were taken to the police station for legal action. Yesterday morning, the 17th team of the 4th district of the Wusong Water Police dispatched patrol boats to patrol along the coast. The pirate ship had already escaped without a trace.</p>
<h3>Jiang Youzhi Asks for Assistance from the Women's Association</h3>
<p>Dong Yu Has No Sincere Intention to Reconcile</p>
<p>The case of lawyer Dong Yu recently accusing his wife Jiang Youzhi of having lung disease and petitioning the French Concession Court for divorce has been opened for trial twice. The official instructed them to reconcile outside the court. Dong Yu offered 3,000 yuan for the living expenses of their eight-year-old daughter, but only the interest could be used, not the principal. He did not mention how to support Jiang, so Jiang felt that her life was still not guaranteed. Dong Kang, Yu's uncle, mediated without success. Yesterday, it was heard that lawyer Sheng Shengxi had visited Dong Yu again to mediate. Unexpectedly, Yu reduced the living expenses for his daughter to 2,000 yuan and showed no sincerity in reconciling. Jiang believes that since Dong Yu's affection for her has been severed, even if they reconcile and live together, she will inevitably be abused by Dong Yu again. Therefore, she requests that Yu provide sufficient living expenses for separation without divorce, but to no avail. She had no choice but to appeal to the Women's Association for assistance. Her petition is the same as the lawsuit, so it is omitted here.</p>
<h3>Grand Occasion of the Annual Meeting of the "Lan Ji"</h3>
<p>The "Lan Ji" is a type of organization for students who have studied in the United States. It was initiated by Mr. Gu Weijun while he was in the United States. After the students studying in the United States returned to China, they established branches in various parts of the country, such as Shanghai, Peiping, and Hankou. The president of the Shanghai branch is Lu Yunming, and the vice president is Wei Jingzhou. An annual meeting is held every year. Yesterday afternoon, starting at 8:30 PM, the annual meeting was held at the Wan Guo Sports Association hall on Jing'an Temple Road. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Important attendees included Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Mamoru, Minister of Railways Sun Ke and his wife, Vice Minister Huang Hanliang and his wife, consuls general from Japan, Germany, Norway, and other countries, President of the High Court Xu Weizhen, Chairman of the Municipal Council Fessenden, bankers Zhang Gongquan, Xu Xinliu, Li Fusun, General Manager of Butterfield &amp; Swire Broun, General Manager of China Electric Company Raymond, and Liu Dajun, Qian Zhiquan, and his wife, totaling more than 400 people.</p>
<p>Wonderful programs included Zhu Xingqing of the National Conservatory of Music playing the pipa, Ms. Ren Aide's piano solo, Ms. Shi Yaoying's rendition of "Su San Gets Released," Ms. Shi Xiumen's "Drumming and Cursing Cao," and Guo Shuliang's magic tricks. Among them, the most exciting was the cross-dressing dance party, which lasted until two or three in the morning before everyone dispersed in joy.</p>
<h3>Fifteen Small Newspaper Offices Jointly Warn Zhan Jifeng</h3>
<p>Wanton Insults Cause Great Outrage</p>
<p>Request a Clear Reply Within Three Days</p>
<p>The case of the female movie actress Hu Die and her fiancé Lin Xuehuai breaking off their engagement has been reported by various newspapers. On the 24th of this month, Hu Die sued Lu Yifang, the editor of the "Ling Bao," in the Special District Court for defamation. Zhan Jifeng was the lawyer representing the plaintiff. When he defended Hu Die, he said (These leaflet-style small newspapers specialize in extortion, etc., which caused public outrage in the entire Shanghai small newspaper industry. They believe that Zhan Jifeng intentionally insulted the small newspaper industry.</p>
<p>Therefore, the "Xiao Ri Bao," "Jin Gang Zuan," "Fu Er Mo Si," "Da Jing Bao," "Xian Bao," "Huang Bao," "She Hui Ri Bao," "Ke Lei Si," "Shanghai Bao," "Ping Bao," "Ling Bao," "Zheng Qi Bao," "Da Bao," "Shanghai Tan," and "Tai Yang Bao" and other fifteen newspapers, jointly sent a letter to lawyer Zhan to question and demand a public apology in the newspaper. The original letter is recorded below: To lawyer Zhan Jifeng, on the 24th of this month, your lawyer repeatedly stated in court on behalf of Hu Die suing "Ling Bao" that (These leaflet-style small newspapers specialize in extortion, etc. It was found that on that day, our colleagues from "Jin Gang Zuan," "Fu Er Mo Si," "Da Jing Bao," "Tai Yang Bao," and "Shanghai Tan Bao" all sent reporters to attend and listen. They were deeply indignant at your lawyer's insulting remarks. After they reported the details to our colleagues, everyone felt that this matter could not be kept silent. It was found that small newspapers have gained considerable status in today's society. No matter what major events occur in any sector that require the assistance of the press, small newspapers are always invited on an equal footing with major newspapers. This proves the importance that all sectors attach to small newspapers. The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau is an administrative agency of the government and has formally registered small newspapers and often sends official letters. This proves that the government has recognized small newspapers as a formal publication related to national education and culture. Lawyers are legal experts and should assist in the development of national education and cultural publications and enhance the status of small newspapers. However, your lawyer used extremely contemptuous words to wantonly insult them, saying (These leaflet-style small newspapers specialize in extortion, witnessed by all, heard by all. This kind of insult in court is extraordinary. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? People have the same heart, and hearts have the same reason. Suppose our colleagues openly wrote in the newspaper, These rogue-style lawyers specialize in extortion. Would people in the legal profession remain silent when they see it? Our colleagues have always known how to love themselves. Not only do they not engage in extortion, but they also regard the newspapers they run as supremely sacred and must be protected and cultivated with all their might. However, lawyers of the highest intellectual class still insult our colleagues in this way. Then, can our colleagues still stand in a society of ordinary intellectual class? After consultation among our colleagues, it is believed that it is necessary to ask your lawyer to point out the facts of extortion of each newspaper and explain the meaning of the three words leaflet-style. Otherwise, this kind of insult cannot be washed away. Please reply clearly within three days. Otherwise, for the sake of the future status, our colleagues have no choice but to seek redress through the law. Correspondingly, this letter is sent to lawyer Zhan Jifeng for your information.</p>

<h3>Director Yuan Warns Against Excessive Issuance of Invitation Cards</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau issued a notice to all districts and teams under its jurisdiction yesterday, stating that police officers inside and outside the bureau often issue notification letters for auspicious and inauspicious events of relatives, without any restrictions. It is close to using this as an excuse to extort money and seek profit. Strict prohibitions have been repeatedly issued, and punishments have been imposed after investigation. However, recently it has been heard that personnel belonging to the bureau are still engaging in such actions, even issuing invitations for marriage and birthdays under the guise of relatives, causing colleagues to be exhausted from socializing and making constant complaints. This is truly a lack of self-respect. It is hereby reiterated and strictly prohibited. In the future, except for major events such as weddings and funerals of direct relatives, which should be approved by the director of the bureau through the competent authorities before issuing invitations, all other invitations shall not be issued arbitrarily. If such a situation occurs again, the recipient of the invitation should immediately submit the original invitation to the director of the bureau for verification. Those who have gone through collection and distribution should also submit it together. The competent authorities should also pay attention to checking and prohibiting it at any time. Once discovered, they will be severely punished and will not be tolerated. If the recipient of the invitation conceals and does not report it, or even sends gifts as a result, and the competent authorities know but do not report it, they will also be punished separately. In addition to distribution, this order is hereby issued for compliance and to instruct subordinates to comply with it. This order.</p>

<h3>Using a Beauty Trap to Defraud Money</h3>
<p>Appeal Heard and Judgement Delivered Yesterday</p>
<p>Sun Xiangru, owner of Qianxing Glass Factory, Pushan Road, Zhabei, was arrested together with Wu You, the wife of Wu Qinglong from Yancheng, in the Huashang Inn room on Xinmin Road on the evening of October 9 this year, by the Fourth District Police Station and transferred to the District Court. Wu Qinglong claimed that Sun Xiangru had an affair with Wu You, who had absconded with his 602 yuan in silver and a gold bracelet worth 198 yuan, for a total of 800 yuan. They were caught in the inn, so he immediately went to arrest them both, etc. When asked, Sun Xiangru confessed that he went to Yancheng this year to collect debts and met Wu You, whose real name was Xiao Erzi, at the inn. She was a prostitute in that area. He had spent five yuan to redeem her and had a one-night relationship with her. This time they colluded to swindle me out of my money. I was on my way home from the North Station and passed by the Huashang Inn when I was invited by the woman to the room. She forced me inside. You can ask Wang Susheng, the owner of the inn. They set up a beauty trap to defraud me of my money, etc. The woman claimed that she also had an affair with Wu Qinglong, and the rest was the same as Wu's confession. The court ruled that Wu You was sentenced to 40 days of detention and ordered to return 800 yuan to Wu Qinglong. Sun Xiangru's part was not accepted. However, after the judgment, Wu You was not satisfied and filed an appeal. Wu also filed an appeal against Sun Xiangru's part. Yesterday, Judge Zhao opened a collegial panel to hear the case.

After the collegial panel's debate ended, it announced the judgment. The part of the original judgment that sentenced Wu You to punishment was revoked because it was an informal union, and the law does not protect the informant who has no right to sue. The appeal of Wu You and others against Sun Xiangru was still maintained in the first instance judgment, rejecting the appeal.</p>

On the evening of the day before yesterday (26th), he suddenly went insane and beat people. Another apprentice stepped forward to stop him and was bitten on the finger. Because Lin was unable to stop him, he used hemp rope to tie up Jincai's hands and feet. Then he rolled around on the ground, uttering incoherently. At that time, Lin did not report to the police station, nor did he send him to the hospital. Jincai died suddenly at one o'clock that night.

<h3>Negotiation Regarding Cargo Ship Accident</h3>
<p>Ling Hongji, a merchant from Huzhou, purchased over 20,000 taels worth of marine delicacies and cassia twigs in Shanghai to sell in Huzhou. A few days ago, he hired Zhang Amao's boat for transportation. Ling, needing to sell the goods quickly due to the winter demand, urged Zhang to travel quickly and without delay, so that the goods could arrive early. In the afternoon of the previous day, Zhang's boat was sailing with the wind when it reached the eighteen-mile stretch of the South Huangpu River. Suddenly, a foreigner's "Bai Xiang" steamboat rushed north and collided head-on with Zhang's boat.

<h3>Party and Government Organs Recommend Union Secretary Trainees</h3>
<p>Order to Prioritize Employment by Unions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party's Public Training Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Government's Bureau of Social Affairs jointly issued an order to all unions in the city, stating that although the union secretary is an employee of the union, they are responsible for bookkeeping, assisting in union affairs, and have significant responsibilities. The union secretary's suitability greatly affects the union's operations and the members' benefits. A competent union secretary benefits the union and its members, while an incompetent one hinders union affairs and harms members. The union secretary is the union's permanent staff member and often the only one. They are most familiar with and enthusiastic about union affairs. If an unsuitable person is selected as the union secretary, they may ingratiate themselves with the capitalists to betray the workers or collude with the communists to incite unrest, ultimately leading to the destruction of the workers' organization and the sacrifice of workers' interests. Recognizing this, the Bureau and Committee organized a Union Secretary Examination Committee last year to conduct examinations and tests for union secretaries. Their regulations stipulate that all levels of union secretaries within the Shanghai Special Municipality must be certified by the Union Secretary Examination Committee. This Committee also established a Union Secretary Training Institute this summer to train fifty professional secretaries, who have now graduated. They should be introduced to various unions for employment by this Committee and Bureau. From now on, any union secretary already employed who is not certified by this Committee and Bureau should be automatically dismissed by the union. Future union secretaries should be chosen primarily from graduates of the Union Secretary Training Institute, to ensure suitable personnel and mutual benefit. This order is hereby issued.</p>

<h3>New Trends in American Literary Circles</h3>
<p>(Continuation from Part Four) Translated by Anping</p>
<p>Masters is one of the poets in this movement. With his own unique poetic style, in his book "Spoon River Anthology," he vividly depicted an impression of American rural life never before seen in American literary circles. In those poems, a town exists entirely in a gray, deathly gloom.</p>
<p>In this collection, all the poems are filled with the same sentiment. There is no so-called "vitality," only gloom, melancholy, and a sense of realism. In Mr. Masters's view, this is what towns encounter in this era of urban development. There, life essentially sinks into a dry mood; the inspiration of beauty cannot exist in such an environment, and the individual soul will perish under such circumstances.</p>
<p>Similar reflections on other backgrounds—not about rural life—are also often present in the poetry of our time. Sandburg has written about cities as Masters has written about rural areas. In his "Smoke and Steel," he roars a challenge. During the early stages of this rebellious movement, Lindsay also greatly repelled and intimidated. Even the poems of Frost, who often wrote about peaceful rural life, are not without despair. If the spirit of Frost's poems is very mature, it is not because he has a prophetic relationship with the rural life contained in his poems. Robinson's poems are also not lacking in this spirit. In his poem "The Master," his satirical lines, "the age of the shopkeeper and the standard of price," are his metaphor for the trends of this era.</p>
<p>All of this that we find in "The Spoon River Anthology" reveals another situation in many novels of this era. Ruth Suckow, in "Country People," writes about farmers just as Masters portrays them in "Spoon River Anthology." In Willa Cather's novels, especially in her "My Antonia" and "The Professor's House," our encounters with those old-fashioned farmers and the decay of the fields and pastures stand in stark contrast. Anderson, in his "Winesburg, Ohio" and "Poor Whites," scratches at the same problems. In the works of these writers, we can see the rural aspects of America. As a result, they are all American novelists, thoroughly American. There is nothing there to imitate them. Anderson's "Winesburg, Ohio" is just as much "American-made" as Frost's North of Boston, Masters's Spoon River Anthology, or Lindsay's Congo. These writers not only use American themes to write about American affairs, but also express these themes in a form or poetic rhythm.</p>
<p>Among the new trends in America we are now discussing, none is more outstanding than Sinclair Lewis. His "Main Street" is written in prose poetry. Lewis has a satirical tone that Masters lacks. The emptiness of small-town life, the superficial lives of the city's residents, the local atmosphere—all of these are accurate descriptions and are expressed in a satirical style. "Babbitt" is a very successful poem. Here, we have a new American revelation, one that did not exist before the 19th century. "Babbitt" is entirely an American-style thing. "Zenith" can only be considered an American city. Elmer Gantry can only be considered an American. Even his style, that humorous style, is American. No one but an American could write something like that.</p>
<p>In the novels of Theodore Dreiser and the plays of Eugene O'Neill, rural areas and small towns are not so often portrayed. In some of O'Neill's early scripts, attention was paid to this aspect, but there was no revelation. On the other hand, O'Neill, like Dreiser, tended more towards the urban and the mechanical. American drama, before O'Neill, was like American novels in the very early days. Since the 20th century, due to the increase in America's international status, just like literature, new American drama has gained a new strength. In the works of Philip Barry, Sidney Howard, Paul Green, and O'Neill, we can find real American drama, and among those American playwrights, O'Neill is especially close to the American sentiment. In his "The Hairy Ape," "Strange Interlude," and "Dynamo," there is indeed some expression of the problems in the American environment, which cannot be matched by ordinary writers. Moreover, his expression of American problems is done with the inherent temperament of America. In O'Neill's works, we cannot find any British atmosphere, and on the other hand, he has his own unique qualities.</p>
<p>O'Neill's plays and Dreiser's novels are similar; in their works, there is the same kind of utilitarian philosophy. Although the "big business" events particularly emphasized by Dreiser are not present in O'Neill's works, the problem of the fate of American individualism is contained in the same way as in Dreiser's. In all of Dreiser's works, there is a tone at the end—the desperate situation of the individual in modern society. What he occupies is a merit of not writing about people. The person's demeanor, that agile soul, is often destroyed under his pen. The shadow of the terror of fate缠绕him, causing him to fail. This wave of despair can be seen in any of Dreiser and O'Neill's events. In those very emotionally intense scripts such as "The Titan," "The Financier," and "The American Tragedy," this point is fully revealed. Other scripts such as "Beyond the Horizon," "The Hairy Ape," "Desire Under the Elms," "Strange Interlude," and "Dynamo," although comparatively different, have also failed to overcome this point. For example, O'Neill in "Dynamo" is even more mired in this point than in "Beyond the Horizon." In the tragedy "Beyond the Horizon," the characters do not have a definite part, while in "Dynamo," the characters have decisive power in any case. In fact, the characters have almost completely become a mystical thing, a demon, a Shinto. The individual is only a slave to fate. The future is held in the entire machinery of society, not in the hands of its creators.</p>
<p>All of this struggle that is booming in modern American literature highlights the inability of individuals to survive in this mechanized society. Or, in other words, behind the individualism in this philosophy, there is still a social relationship, especially in the literature and art that shows its characteristics in the struggle for survival. In various desolate moods, one learns to have this aversion. The American standards of living produced by the developed American industry, the commercialism that spreads to art, become the targets of attack by modern American literary artists.</p>
<p>The paintings of Mr. Fang Ganmin</p>
<p>have his new 的. This new literary debate provides a fresh battlefield for contemporary critics and literary artists. Those anthropologists and literary figures under the guidance of Irving Babbitt and Paul Elmer More rebel against all modern spirits. From this standpoint, they clearly harbor resistance to science and this machine age. In their ethics, they uphold their dualism. They feel that if they want to save the individual, they cannot simultaneously praise the machine, so they replace science with religion as a touchstone for evaluating values. Unfortunately, those who oppose the humanists do not grasp the individual relationships in the problem, but only attack the religious opinions of the new humanists. The decline in the influence of Mr. H.L. Mencken, an important critic of the twentieth century, is also partly due to the lack of accurate knowledge on this difficult issue.</p>
<p>If it comes to making American literature "American," it has indeed made a new effort. In the style of James Branch Cabell or Thornton Wilder, it may not be. But in Poictesme or Peru, there is a great deal of interest. Or, in the works of writers such as John Dos Passos, Michael Gold, and Ernest Hemingway, it may be expressed in a new form. (The End)</p>

<h3>Written to Bao Juncheng Bixing</h3>
<p>(Continued from the fourth)</p>
<p>I don't know where it came from, but one day I found twenty dollars in my pocket, and I felt rich. So I also had the courage to talk to a maid in her family under the pretext of renting a house. I opened my mouth and asked (the maid),</p>
<p>(Do you have a house for rent here?)</p>
<p>(No,) the maid replied.</p>
<p>(Does only one family live here?)</p>
<p>(Yes.)</p>
<p>(Do you have a Miss here?)</p>
<p>(Yes.)</p>
<p>(What school does she attend?)</p>
<p>(She doesn't study anymore. She used to be at Guanghua University.)</p>
<p>(Ah, then why does she go outside every day?)</p>
<p>(She's learning to type with a foreigner and has to go every day.)</p>
<p>(Is she betrothed?)</p>
<p>(Tch, you're being improper, sir!) the maid scolded me.)</p>
<p>After this inquiry, my heart seemed to feel a little better. But Bao Jun, what still doesn't satisfy me is, why did that maid try to keep it a secret when I asked about her Miss's marriage? Did she also know that I was in love with her Miss? If not, then what is the reason?</p>
<p>○○</p>
<p>After parting with the maid, I returned to my garret. But, Bao Jun, now that I had twenty dollars, I couldn't stay sitting in the garret. I felt that no matter what, I had to find a way to spend these twenty dollars. It's a pity that I have never had any savings in my life. Once I got twenty dollars, how could I not find a way to spend it? Leaving the garret, I originally wanted to go to a coffee shop to have coffee because there were also Russian baroness waitresses in the coffee shop, and I could talk to them. At this time, I feel a thirst for the opposite sex.</p>
<p>But Bao Jun, this is another unexpected thing. How lucky I am! Perhaps God is secretly helping me. Pitying me for being too lonely, He specially gave me a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>She who lives at 161 Road, has a personal servant girl, whom I know, and she has also seen me a few times. That day, when I came out of the garret, I happened to meet her on Avenue Joffre. I immediately mustered my courage and walked up to her, gave her a dollar, and asked her where she was going. After she received the dollar, she replied,</p>
<p>(To the pharmacy.)</p>
<p>(Who needs medicine?)</p>
<p>(Our mistress.)</p>
<p>(You mean your Miss's mother?)</p>
<p>(Yes.)</p>
<p>(What's your master's surname?)</p>
<p>(Zeng.)</p>
<p>(Where is she from?)</p>
<p>(Oh, no wonder your Miss is so beautiful. Guangxi is a place of beautiful mountains and rivers!)</p>
<p>(Enough idle talk, young master. Why are you asking me these questions?)</p>
<p>(No reason. I'll ask you again, what kind of business does your master do?)</p>
<p>(He's in the exchange.)</p>
<p>(I don't believe it. You still can't speak Shanghainese.)</p>
<p>(We haven't been in Shanghai for long. Our master used to be a division commander. Since the revolution failed, our master changed careers to become an exchange dealer.)</p>
<p>(············)</p>
<p>Alas, Bao Jun, it turns out they are just like me! They also came to Shanghai after the revolution hit a wall! Alas, they and I are comrades in exile! Bao Jun, after I understood their background, I couldn't help but shed tears.</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>The next day, I wrote a letter to MISS Zeng and gave the maid two dollars, asking her to pass it on for me. I waited for the maid's reply near Road.</p>
<p>Bao Jun, you probably know that my mood at this time cannot be described in any way.</p>
<p>But, Bao Jun, how unfortunate! Pity me for waiting on the road for one hour, two hours, all the way up to twelve hours, but the maid was not seen. I knew I had been deceived. I had to return to my garret with tears in my eyes.</p>
<p>Waiting again for the third day, I finally found a chance to meet the maid. I immediately questioned her face-to-face, asking why she had broken our appointment yesterday. She replied, (After our Miss read the letter, she scolded her.)</p>
<p>(Since that's the case, then you can ask her why she threw her own silk handkerchief to me in the French Park?) I was not willing to show weakness, so I answered the maid like this.</p>
<p>(I can't relay this for you. You should go ask her yourself.)</p>
<p>(I can't go into your house. How can I ask her myself?)</p>
<p>(There's a way. She goes to No. Road to learn typing at three o'clock every afternoon. You can wait on the road.)</p>
<p>(Really?)</p>
<p>(I'm not lying to you.)</p>
<p>(Okay, thank you for the information.) In this way, I parted with the maid and went home again.</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>But, Bao Jun, when I met MLISS Zeng in the middle section of Road the next day, I mustered my courage and brazenly greeted her. But MISS Zeng answered me like this, which really made me not know how to respond.</p>
<p>(I've read your letter. I've only just met you. We can't even be called friends, so how can we talk about loving you?)</p>
<p>(Then, let's start by being friends, MISS Zeng,) I pleaded with her again.</p>
<p>(It's not impossible to be friends, but if you have ulterior motives in associating with me, then please forgive me for not being able to agree.)</p>
<p>Oh, oh, Bao Jun, I am fundamentally in love with her! If I don't love her, then why should I be friends with her? It's a pity that MISS Zeng doesn't understand me. She always wants to reject my love. How can I endure this? How can I endure this?····</p>
<p>(Can't we gradually start falling in love from acquaintance?) Suddenly, I had a flash of inspiration and came up with these words.</p>
<p>(That refers to the result. If it fails, we may not even be able to maintain the feelings of friendship in the future. If you start with the ulterior motive of wanting to marry me, you are fundamentally wrong.)</p>
<p>Bao Jun, after hearing these words, what else can I teach you to answer her? What else can I teach you to answer her?</p>
<p>(Then MISS Zeng, you don't even want to be friends with me?) Finally, I came up with this question again.</p>
<p>(I didn't say that.)</p>
<p>Alas, Bao Jun, I still have hope! I still have hope! MISS Zeng didn't reject me ○○○</p>
<p>But, Bao Jun, since I met her, our feelings have been very harmonious, and she can also understand my character, which makes me so happy! I feel that my future is infinitely happy.</p>
<p>However, who knew that in the past few days, due to the intrusion of the severe autumn wind, she actually fell ill because of it. I am really worried about this matter. I have also gone to her house to inquire about her condition. I see that her face has indeed thinned a lot these past few days. I feel as if the flesh on my own body has been cut off, and it is even more painful. It's a pity that the heavens always like to play tricks on people. I don't know how many tears I have shed for her.</p>
<p>If, unfortunately, her illness really cannot be cured, then I am determined to follow her to the underworld. Although we can only be said to be friends now, but I am willing to die for her, and on my part, there is no reluctance at all.</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>Someone also advised me, (A great man need not worry about not having a wife). These words are originally correct, but, Jun, if I can't get MISS Zeng to be my wife, then I feel that life is boring. My whole life is hopeless. I might as well shoot myself to death with a pistol.</p>
<p>Because MISS Zeng is sick, writing a letter to her would strain her spirit, so I changed to writing a letter to you. Bao Jun, I am not important. I am not afraid of begging for food. But, if I can't get MISS Zeng to be my lifelong companion, then I might as well go die. Then I might as well go die. Alas, MISS Zeng, although this letter is written to Bao Jun, after you read it, I don't know what kind of feelings you will have. I don't know what kind of feelings you will have. Alas, Bao Jun, if you like to drink wine, then you should also pray to God for me, wishing MISS Zeng's illness a speedy recovery, and also wishing our love an early success. Goodbye, I also wish you good health and wish your virtuous wife's lung disease an early turnaround, let's consider this an exchange condition for our mutual prayers, (End)</p>
