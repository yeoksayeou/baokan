<p>時評</p>
<h3>世界各國間之主義與利害</h3>
<p>世界各國間之聯合。大找由於利害。而不由於主義。故一國之工黨執政。未必即與他工黨國相聯。反之主義不相同。或以利害相同之故。君主國家或與民世界各國間之主義與利害國家相聯。其故蓋由於對於對於國外。主義之關係少。而利害之關係。多非若對於國内之必先以主義爲主。對於主義之相近者。易於聯合。對於主義之相反者。不能聯合也。</p>
<p>試以近日之倫敦海會證之。法意之不相容。日美之難相讓。英美日。與英法意之間。成爲問題之兩系。而此兩系者。皆爲利害之關係。非由主義之關係也。法意相離甚近。故其爭執烈。日美相離較遠。故其爭執較爲和平也。其他若歐洲各小國間之離合。尤爲顯然。</p>
<p>國際間之離合。祇爲利害。故不特不關於主義。且亦不問種族。不論遠近。不計文野。利則合之。害則離之。昔利而今害。則合而離之。昔害而今利。則離而合之。即或有歷史之關係。恩怨之關係。或久合而不離。或久離而不合。而其要點。則仍在於利害也。</p>

<p>女　　、當昨日二隊比賽、雙方男女同學均蒞場助威極盛一時　裁判員張匯蘭杜庭修　上半時、二三比十一、蘇中占先　結果四十九比十六、蘇中獲勝、</p>
<p>相持不下　蘇中孫淑銓長身玉立、中央跳球、多占優勢、開賽之初、蘇中傳遞進取、孫雙手抛去　應聲入籃、紀錄旣開　東吳大軍反開、不久、强傑亦命中一球　造成平數、其時雙方勢均力敵、相持不下、惟蘇中聯絡傳遞、高人一籌、第一節蘇中八東吳五、</p>
<p>高下漸分　第二節起、蘇中前鋒敏捷非凡、足跡所趨、令人驚畏、東吳内衛盡力抵抗、無濟於事、閃眼間、蘇中章映芬孫淑銓各中一球、此後東吳雖略有所得、但多處於對方壓迫之下、絶少發展之餘地、上半時、蘇中二十三東吳十一</p>
<p>益有精彩　第三節中、蘇中内外表演、益有精彩　擲籃獲分　如囊中取物　俯仰比是　東吳以强傑最佳、其餘頗有侷促不安之現象、此節蘇中十二東吳二</p>
<p>高占鰲頭　其時蘇中氣燄極高、精神益足、在塲同學　目覩其成功在即、莫不揚眉吐氣、唱歌呼喊　抑揚中聽、東吳忽一人罰出　無人代替、即以五人應戰、作戰成績　較前略佳、然大勢以去　無法挽回　蘇中遂以四九比一六、高占鰲頭</p>
<p>蘇州女中隊　▲東吳女生隊</p>
<p>職位　姓名　犯規得分　職位姓　名犯規得分</p>
<p>前鋒王汝珉　○次　二　前鋒郭眉馥二次　六</p>

<p>内衛孫煖貞　二次　内衛張如璞○次</p>
<p>内衛張蟾桂　一次　内衛俞　楨一次</p>
<p>總結　十三次四九　總結　十次十六</p>
<p>上半時蘇中二十三　東吳十一分</p>
<p>下半時蘇中二十六　東吳五分</p>
<p>球藝略評　蘇中前鋒之聯絡工作極佳、章映芬擲投準確、百不失一、孫淑銓人高力强、縱横一時　王汝珉靈巧活潑、往來如飛、内衛監視嚴密、應付裕如、張蟾桂尤爲此中翹楚　東吳人才、亦頗可取、而强傑郭眉馥二人、成績最佳</p>
<h3>女網球東吳獲錦標</h3>
<p>雙打一組：：東吳勝京女中</p>
<p>單打二組：：東吳京女中各勝一組</p>
<p>女子網球决賽、東吳劉煦芬張叱以六比二六比零勝京女中茅於文曹秀娥、裁判余志忠、劉與張體力大而發球有力、劉之球更好、而京女中之茅於文、接球穩妥、毫無一失、惜因曹氏過弱、雙打時、彼此不能聯絡、而曹之藝較優於張、而茅之藝實勝於劉、蓋劉之發球姿勢欠佳、甚爲美中不足、惟以劉張之藝較爲平均、茅幾以一人而抵禦之、致爲劉張所敗、</p>
<p>單打一組、東吳劉煦臧以六比三六比零勝京女中曹秀娥、又一組京女茅於文以六比二六比四勝張傑、結果二對一女網球錦標、爲東吳所得、</p>

<h3>余賀增在古巴之榮譽</h3>
<p>— 離塵</p>
<p>古巴灣京華僑有三萬餘。在商業上頗有一部分之勢力。對於祖國文藝。極力提倡。舉凡可以爲吾國揚眉吐氣者。靡不盡力羅致之。如幻術家余賀增之赴該地獻技。即其一也。</p>
<p>灣京巴黎戲院。爲著名大戲院之一。華僑某鑒於該地幻術之卑劣不足道。乃介紹余賀增前往獻技。藉以表現中國人之幻術。遠勝於古巴人士也。當余未表演之前數日。即努力宣傳。果也登臺一顯好身手。古巴人士爲之傾倒。二月二日有美商某震其名。揚言於衆曰。余君之技藝固臻上乘。然驚人之技。惜未之見。今願與余君博。有木箱一。請余君臥其中。悉密釘之。苟余君能自行跳出箱外。願以千金爲壽。否則余君之技。僅小技耳。是時華僑中有爲余君危者。余君慨然曰。是末技也。何足道。某商依議行之。密釘後。某商復向觀衆報告協議經過畢。高聲呼余君速出。其意在窘余君。孰知余君不待呼畢。已高立木箱上矣。於是觀衆咸驚嘆不置。而某商亦以千金之支票一紙獻於余君。並深致欽仰之意。</p>
<p>余君所獻各技。確足動人。惟有不能已於言者。余君獻技時。恒喜衣中國舊式蟒袍。致使外人疑中國仍以此衣爲現代之禮服也。寄語余君。其力矯之是幸。</p>
<h3>誌錯愛</h3>
<p>— 絜非</p>
<p>疇昔之夜。Ｃ君起作促膝談。爲叙其爲人錯愛一事。其中情節。頗屬離奇。因誌之。</p>
<p>Ｃ君去秋來入中大兩周後。即獲一署名ＫＹＭ君穠艷之情書。遠頒自開封。乃以Ｃ君爲娟娟弱息。語多繾綣。意尤纏綿。若有不勝其眷念與顚倒者。Ｃ君憐恨交并。然終以恨量不及憐重之故。猶以書報之。中多斥戲。未綴小妹二字於問號之上。而Ｋ君毫不爲悟。反頻頻來書。Ｃ君亦頻頻報之。惟嚴斥其誤謬耳。又書來。間附以郵花。自一元至數元不等。倩Ｃ君爲購寄新書。Ｃ君亦聽其驅遣。雖欲絶。以郵花來。終不能也。於今一年。凡爲快信掛號信十五六通。平信亦達三十通。最近且將玉照來。思得瓊瑤之報也。</p>
<p>Ｋ君近在下窪鎭郵局服務。持辭嘗不能達其意。然書法頗佳。而一往情深。尤足使人爲之哀感不置也。</p>
<p>余意Ｋ君之心目中。定有其鍾情之眞正異性者在。其致Ｃ君第一函。曾有「同試同取」之語。又告以經濟艱窘。不克來學。Ｃ君以小仁而鑄大錯。爲人受愛。亦戀愛之别開生面者矣。</p>
<p>附「關於Ｋ君姓名。不明書。從Ｃ君意也。」</p>
<h3>牛乳沐身之女子</h3>
<p>— 維</p>
<p>甘肅與青海交界處。有地曰西寗。内多土人曰薩拉圖。此種土人。男子奇醜而女子則甚妍。蠻夷土著。類多妖形怪狀。不堪一覩。而此獨不然。其女子不但美秀可愛。肌肉更細膩瑩潔逾常人。推其因。嘗見此類女子以牛乳浴其體膚。自然奇光煥發。而潔白如玉矣。</p>
<p>欲得此類女子。不須採取戀愛乞婚。或其他種種手續。祇須購馬數匹之。惟馬必擇其駿者。否則難中其選。反遭拒絶也。聞友人談及其友張君嘗至西寗。述之如此。</p>

<h3>湖上新聲</h3>
<p>— 憶紅館主</p>
<p>地有湖山美。東南第一州。此古人所以稱美杭州者也。蓋其襟江帶海。擁湖抱山。光景之窃窕。氣象之雄偉。豈第東南之最。實甲於寰區。歐之瑞士。縱堪伯仲。而半施以人工。以言天然。遜我實多。以故游客踵接於道。即海外異邦之士。靡不流連歎慕。有披圖而欣羡者。溯自吳越建國。南宋奠都。千百年來。繁盛益著。宜乎元代意大利人馬哥孛羅游記。當目爲世界繁盛之最焉。</p>
<p>杭州名勝。爲有西湖而顯。輓近物質發達。湖上建築。尤多矞麗。博覽會之大禮堂。其最著者也。堂於歲初。由政府撥歸杭州電電。充辦理用户娱樂電影院之用。凡該廠用户。均有贈送免費觀映劵之權利。蓋寓與民同樂之意耳。院中設備。力趨美善。歷來所映影片。大半係歐美最新出品。每届換片。萬人空巷。其最足令人詫異者。杭垣丘八雖多。從不敢倚勢强入。或無理取閙。致擾觀衆清興。然而維持秩序者。固爲乳臭未乾之指引童也。聞主持該院者。爲電廠業務課長陳壽蔭氏。陳於電影。經騐甚富。宜其措施有方矣。</p>
<p>劇訊　同德醫院改建新屋。聞已籌劃甚久。近經决在赫德路地點。其院中一切新設備。需欵甚巨。因擬演劇一天。以資補助。該院院長龐京周。於昨日往蘇接洽法醫班事歸滬後。曾即夕邀南北名角。商訂戲目。聞已内定荀慧生周信芳之割髮代首。高慶奎貫大元金少山之戰長沙。徐碧雲之八大鎚。李桂春白玉崑趙君玉林樹森王虎辰等之雙黄鶴樓。小楊月樓劉小衡趙如泉王芸芳等之八郎探母。蓉麗娟白牡丹周鳳琴李慧琴之四金蓮。劉漢臣王英武李祥云之大泗洲城等戲。於星期五（本月二十一日）正午在上海舞臺開演云。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（一五三）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第九回　諸名士閧笑捉迷藏　一嬌孃任情施擁護</p>
<p>明鏡俱樂部正對跑馬場。好似戲院子裏的花樓一般。又來了這許多姑娘們。粉白黛綠。花團錦簇的坐了一陽台。香風過處。笑語生春。引得對面坐在用木板搭的看台上年輕男女。時時回轉頭來看這裏。因爲看跑馬須隔開至少半點鐘。方跑一回。跑過一回以後。冷清清一片跑馬場。有什麽好看。倒不如回轉頭過來。看看那樓上的趣娘娘。（上海稱美婦人曰趣娘娘。）甚而至於看得昏了。一脚踏在空裏。因爲跌交的也有。馬路經過的馬車。也都是打扮得珠圍翠繞。樓上望着他們。他們也望着樓上。也有幾位。本來原約到明鏡俱樂部來的。後來却被客人邀了去坐馬車。不能來了。可是伊還掛念着到明鏡俱樂部來的諸姊妹。馬車經過泥城橋西首。早已仰起了頭在望着。樓上的人。見了馬車中是認識的姊姊。也便老三老四的喊着他們。他們也老五老六的答應着。因此愈加引得人都向明鏡俱樂部的陽台上望。好像明鏡俱樂部的陽台上。裝着一個絶大吸鐵石。馬路上往來行人的頭頸裏。都有一塊鐵。不知不覺的都被伊們的吸引力。吸了過去。那時候是最後的一次跳浜。各騎師都賈著餘勇。一顯他們的好身手。鄭彥修本來不喜歡看什麽賽馬。却周旋於羣雄之間。不過大家都喊着他道。七少。這裏來。有的道。七少。這裏還有一個位子。可以擠擠。鄭彥修好似法國的盧騷。常常是簇擁於羣花之間。爲伊們所歡迎。鄭彥修道。這跑馬是千篇一律。毫没有什麽變化。有什麽可看。祇不過是一個外國騎師。穿了各樣顏色的衣服。騎在一匹馬上。大家搶着先跑到的就算赢。後跑到的就算輸。跑一千趟也是這個樣子。倒不如看猴子做把戲。一頭猴子騎在一隻狗身上。兜個圈子好看得多咧。那時這位碧犀館道。七少。你來　。這一回不是那老花樣。却是跳浜呀。你來看　。說着。便輕舒玉臂。斜倚嬌軀。把個七少拉了過來。左詩晨還向鄭彥修扮了一個鬼臉。笑着道。不是老花樣。換了一個新鮮花樣。那是紅樓夢上賈璉向王熙鳳說的話咧。好在碧犀館也莫明其妙。因爲今天素君不在這裏。鄭彥修也比較的可以自由一些。也便擠到了陽台上來。</p>

<h3>棉花市狀清堅</h3>
<p>棉市尚堅、但外棉略跌、實以各路來源寥落、與標準同類之貨缺乏、漢帮將一部份現棉關緊不售、故形勢極其堅挺、棉市目前情形、尚難看小也、</p>

<h3>糧食河斛頂粳竟達念元</h3>
<p>閘北　昨日到船寥寥、祗十號左右、市上買氣仍殷、北粳因貨稀續昻一角外、市高已到二十元、倘特頂粳開出關外矣、至於中關等粳、店胃頗濃、大盤綂在十八元半至十九元之間、形勢殊有青雲直上之概、薄稻亦向上、緣存貨凋零、買户問津殷勤、價格又提角半、羊杜秈消化仍爽、市盤逐步上漲、高貨至十七元六七角、而與裏路價格相較尚不划、客埠秈則無上落、陰變等元米存到不足十號、去化活潑、行情續緊近角、</p>
<p>滬南　河下來貨益稀、本街銷塲情淡、緣倘再暢進、價必立見奇盤、因此微轉觀望常錫機粳與蘇同白粳斛數仍旺、價加一角、次貨帶定、南路青頂等薄稻、竟仍稀落、所有存積、因有各檔客帮採辦、行將告罄、是以步好角左羊秈胃鄉稍平、杜秈需要甚佳、各秈大盤綂告微升、交易稍遜于前日、白元貨枯胃貪、情况堅挺、項陰元開十五元半左右、</p>
<h3>洋米逐日狂漲</h3>
<p>内地帮盡力爭辦</p>
<p>現貨漲二角以上</p>
<p>期貨又漲錢外</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、鋒鋩愈甚、現貨路貨竟又續漲兩角、期貨又漲錢外、市面之嚴緊、爲今春第一次發見、蓋緣江浙兩省之内地帮辦興極濃、在市爭先恐後、不遺餘力、新到雖有十餘萬包、奈除去解貨外、爲數不多、盡爲内地本街等搜去、計開出現貨一號西黄一千包、價至十五元、小絞四千包、價至十四元四角半、敏黨四千包、價十五元半至十四元七角、二號一千包、價十四元七角、期米因産地阻止之故、洋行不敢再抛、回寵貨交易甚佳、開出五千噸以上、一號西貢四五月份六兩八錢半、二號三月份六兩八錢、小絞三月份六兩半、四月份六兩四錢半、路貨與現貨相近、祗相差一二角云、</p>
<h3>粉銷受時局影響</h3>
<p>客帮觀望：多空停手：市面盤旋</p>
<p>昨日粉市上下午開盤後、各月份大致呈盤旋之勢、以廠家無甚動靜、客帮則以時局之故、亦祇好暫時觀望、至一般浮空浮多、亦因前途無發展之望、大家停手、蓋就廠家之存底言、因少巨大之存粉、但銷場不起、以之應市、則覺有餘、况外埠小麥、目下仍陸續裝來、此種情形、實爲粉市難以發展之大礙也、後步須看時局如何、再定計較也、結果本月份與前日同、四月份好五釐、五月份小二釐、六月份不動、七月份好五釐、八月份好七釐半云、</p>
<h3>期麥近堅遠平</h3>
<p>現貨祇開一千包</p>
<p>昨日期麥上下午開盤後、各月份呈近堅遠平之象、本月份以距交割日近、業外空頭均須抵補、因此開價、步堅、至四月份以内地如　家　方面、聞小麥須禁止出口、以免民食之恐慌、兼之洋麥報價微好、人心亦堅、至遠期新麥、以天氣日佳、人心頗軟、雖内地帮未肯抛出、市勢終見疲懈也、結果本月份較前日漲三分、四月份好二分、六月份小二分、七月份不動、八月份小一分、現貨市面、廠胃較淡、因見交之貨、中次居多、中小廠家頗不歡迎也、開宿州麥五兩一錢、紹興麥五兩、江西麥四兩六錢二分、共開一千包云、</p>
<h3>疋頭北帮來電止辦疋頭</h3>
<p>市面不振：貨價跌多漲少</p>
<p>疋頭交易、昨益餐靜、客帮蓋以時局混沌、觀望不前、北方各埠竟有來電止辦者、川漢帮亦歸停頓、故市面又形不振、昨日存底較多之貨、俱已紛紛下落、東貨之元直貢呢又跌、莫于山獵雁慕秋開二錢五分半、長板橋二錢六分七角半、百子圖二錢二分走銷頗靜、細　嘰盤旋不定、昨寳球寳球又小二厘半、惟湖心亭·歡樂什色均開二錢七厘半、世樂鳥細布跌二分半、售七兩五錢七分半、但十四磅細布反漲五分、信號兵開八兩六錢半、月雁八兩六錢、漂布俱小、鹿鶴已售至七兩八錢、天賜黄金八兩六錢、花鳥六兩二錢、銷路昨以本街較爲活動、色子貢·印花色汀等均有相當之成交、西貨素府綢依然俏利、豐裕貨昨售四錢九分半、德記晋公子六錢二分半、七絲生羅本街續有辦進、價多數售五兩一錢半云、</p>

<h3>五金花園鉛絲銷路又旺</h3>
<p>花園鉛絲市面　昨日又現活潑氣象　蓋時局嚴重、各機關均有採辦、而客帮方面、亦多購備、故昨全市開出達五六千紥之巨、而其後之繼辦者復多人在、標準因環境所趨、漲起五錢、計每會又售至八兩六錢半、聞到貨甚寡、積存又淺、前途趨况、殊抱樂觀、</p>
<h3>白鐵湧到後市轉滯疲</h3>
<p>英美平白鐵自到源湧旺後、人心大衰、標準回落、惟出路方面、因時局不靖、各帮裹足不前、所以開出寥寥、聞二日來全市開出祗五百餘紥、購進者多屬建築帮及本街零售、客帮生意、甚屬鮮少、行情二十四號英貨十一兩二錢半、二十六號十二兩、二十八號十二兩五錢、三十一號十三兩五錢、美貨則尚少變遷云、</p>

<p>Departed from Nanjing yesterday morning: Will Arrive in Songhu Today</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang departed from Nanjing for Zhen on the morning of the 20th, accompanied by Secretary Gao Lingbai, Adjutant Zhang Zhen, and more than ten others. His itinerary is to first inspect the Xiangshan and other forts in Zhenjiang, then take the Jiangyuan warship from Zhenjiang to Shanghai to review the Fifth Division troops, and inspect the Wusong Forts. He will then go to Hangzhou, Ningbo and other places for inspection. During the inspection period, Chairman's duties will be temporarily handled by Tan Yankai. (20th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his staff in five cars, arrived in Zhenjiang at 10 a.m. on the 20th and inspected Xiangshan Fort. He then boarded the Jiangyuan warship to inspect the various fortresses of Chuishan Pass and Jiangyin. The provincial government did not receive prior notice, so there were no guards along the way. Temporary sentries were placed by the Marine Corps from the train station to the pier, and salutes were fired. Niu Yongjian, upon hearing the news, rushed to the riverbank, intending to take a boat to Jiaoshan to meet him, but Chiang had already boarded the ship. The Jiangyuan went east. Zhang Shouyong and He Yushu received the news earlier and met him briefly. (20th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Jiangyin) Chairman Chiang arrived in Cheng by the Hai Chou warship from Zhenjiang at 5 p.m. on the 20th, and landed to inspect Huangshan Fort, accompanied by his wife, Song Meiling, and the captain, adjutants and attendants, eight or nine people in total. He asked Fortress Commander Yang Yunhua about the following points: 1. The cannon positions and troop numbers of each fort; 2. The names of the local garrison troops and administrative officials; 3.

After Yan assumed office on the 18th, he telegraphed the Beiping Garrison Command to take over the Beiping General Headquarters and Field Headquarters, renaming them the United Army General Headquarters Field Headquarters. 3. Yan's military plan is to have a portion of the Shaanxi army move out of northern Hubei and another portion towards Longhai. The Jin army will be mobilized in Daming, with a portion moving south along the Pinghan Line into Henan, and then transferring the Daming garrison to Shandong to counterattack the Jinpu Line. 4. All units of the Jin army moved out on the 17th, and a large part gathered in the northern section of the Pinghan Road. 5. Locomotives, freight cars, and passenger cars on the northern sections of Longhai, Ningsi, Pinghan, and Jinpu were all detained by Yan and Feng, causing traffic on these lines to stop. Zhang Xueliang repeatedly telegraphed Jin and Yan, requesting the return of the Ningsi Road vehicles, but to no avail. (20th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is also telegraphed that the earliness or lateness of Yan's arrival in Peiping depends on the earliness or lateness of the Northwest Army's arrival in Zhengzhou. (20th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The delegation has various suggestions on political issues, with the restoration of the Second National Congress constitution as the slogan. They will invite all Guangdong members to come north to serve as consultants for the military government. (20th) (Beiping) The Luoyang Church telegraphed, saying that it is reported that the Northwest Army is continuously arriving in Shaanxi from Tong Pass. Wan Xuancai's troops here are recruiting new soldiers. (20th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Civic groups in Peiping earnestly request military and police authorities to protect the people's movements. (20th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance Su Tiren arrived in Peiping this afternoon. (20th Special Telegram)</p>

The government will be composed of three departments: General Affairs, Finance, and Foreign Affairs. Each department will be divided into three divisions. Feng's army will be renamed the Second, Third, and Fourth Army Corps of the Chinese Army. Lu Zhonglin will be appointed as the commander of the Second Army Corps, Zhang Peirong as the commander of the Third Army Corps, and the commander of the Fourth Army Corps is yet to be determined. (19th Japan United Press Telegram)</p>
<h3>Hu Hanmin's Speech</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Hu Hanmin gave a speech, saying that although Yan once upheld the Party's doctrines and served the revolution, his understanding of the revolution was too shallow, and he was also invaded by the feudal warlord traditions, leading him to repeat the mistakes of the Northern Warlords. However, the central government has always been determined to treat people with kindness, to implement a policy of peaceful unification, and to seek the implementation of the reorganization plan. Therefore, it only resorted to force to eliminate the rebels when it was impossible to salvage the situation. This kind of hardship will surely be understood by the people of the country. He also said that the rebellions were all caused by the lack of revolutionary consciousness and determination, and were dominated by historical, geographical, and traditional characteristics. Therefore, our party comrades must shoulder the heavy responsibility of the revolution, complete the revolutionary mission, and not fall behind or defect halfway. Only by paying attention to the cultivation of revolutionary consciousness and the determination of revolutionary personality, and especially by transcending the inner contradictions of reason, can we build a revolutionary personality that transcends all contradictions and bear the revolutionary responsibility of conquering contradictions.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Doctrines and Interests Among Countries of the World</h3>
<p>The union of countries in the world is mostly due to interests, and not due to doctrines. Therefore, the labor party in power in one country may not necessarily be associated with another labor party country. Conversely, countries with different doctrines may unite due to the same interests. A monarchical country may be associated with a democratic country. The reason for this is that the relationship of doctrine to foreign countries is less important, while the relationship of interests is more important. This is not the case for domestic affairs, where doctrine must first be the main consideration. Those whose doctrines are similar are easier to unite with, and those whose doctrines are opposite cannot unite.</p>
<p>The recent London Naval Conference is evidence of this. The incompatibility between France and Italy, and the difficulty of concession between Japan and the United States. The British-American-Japanese alliance, and the British-French-Italian alliance, have become two conflicting systems. These two systems are based on the relationship of interests, not on the relationship of doctrines. France and Italy are very close, so their conflict is fierce. Japan and the United States are farther apart, so their conflict is more peaceful. Other cases, such as the separation and reunion among the small countries of Europe, are even more obvious.</p>
<p>The separation and reunion between nations is only for the sake of interest. Therefore, it is not only unrelated to doctrines, but it also does not consider race, distance, civilization, or barbarity. If it is beneficial, they unite. If it is harmful, they separate. If it was beneficial in the past but is harmful now, they unite and separate. If it was harmful in the past but is beneficial now, they separate and unite. Even if there is a historical relationship, a relationship of gratitude or resentment, they may not separate after a long period of union, or they may not unite after a long period of separation. However, the main point is still the relationship of interests.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Communications Recovers Telecommunications Rights Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Communications has scheduled meetings with representatives of the other parties to discuss the recovery of telecommunications rights. A meeting with representatives of the Great Northern Telegraph Company will be held on the 26th, a meeting with representatives of the Pacific Company will be held on the 28th, and a meeting with representatives of the Great Eastern Telegraph Company will be held on April 4th. (20th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Communications is in the process of abolishing the Great Eastern and Great Northern hydroelectric contracts. It has outlined the inequality of the contract and the circumstances of its signing so that the people of the country can understand. The content briefly states that our country has been operating international telecommunications for fifty years. Its lines connect with other countries, connecting with Soviet Russia to the north, Burma to the west, Vietnam to the south, and Europe, America, and Japan to the east via sea lines. According to the 1926 national telecommunications statistics, there were only more than 1.5 million international telegrams, which is far behind other developed countries in the telecommunications industry. The main reason is that the communications authorities in the past were ignorant of the international situation, signed this unequal treaty, lost national sovereignty, and were severely restricted, making it impossible to develop foreign communications. For example, 1. Without the consent of the two companies, our country cannot sign line connection and telecommunications agreements with other foreign countries. 2. Although telegrams between our country and European and American countries can be connected and transmitted with France, England, Russia, and other countries at various borders, the price cannot be freely determined without prior consultation with the company. 3. The companies have telegraph bureaus in Shanghai, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Yantai, and other places to receive and send telegrams, so our country's telecommunications operations in these places are deeply affected. Moreover, according to the contract, if the prices of domestic telegrams in the four districts are increased, I must also seek the consent of the company. All of this is the most unequal. There is no progress to be made without breaking away from this restriction. (20th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Franco-Italian Dispute Remains Unresolved, The Naval Conference Reaches Stalemate</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th - The deadlock at the Five-Power Naval Conference remains due to the unresolved dispute between France and Italy over tonnage equality. Naval experts are now moved by the efforts of the conference chairman, MacDonald, and are working daily to find a solution. Today, a spokesman for the British delegation stated that MacDonald instructed him to declare that the reports in the press about disagreements between the British and American representatives regarding the US-Japan compromise are absolutely false. Britain has always been informed of the US-Japan talks and fully supports them. MacDonald still hopes for a Five-Power treaty, but such a treaty can only be achieved after a method is found to break the deadlock between France and Italy.</p>
<p>Anglo-American Plenipotentiary Conference</p>
<p>No Results from Discussing Total Figures</p>
<p>Dentsu, London, 19th - The Anglo-American Plenipotentiary Conference was held at St. James's Palace on the 19th. The meeting lasted for two hours. This conference discussed the total figures related to all five countries, including experts. After much discussion, no decision could be made. After the meeting, a British representative stated that the reason the discussion was prolonged for so long was because of a detailed review of the current difficult numbers of France and Italy in order to break the deadlock.</p>
<p>Italy's Strong Attitude</p>

<p>Kokumin, Rome, 19th - Italian newspapers are all critical of the pressure exerted on the Italian delegation by various parties at the London Naval Conference, stating that no matter how other parties make concessions, Italy will never abandon its demand for equality with France.

<p>Briand Returns to Paris</p>
<p>Attending the Chamber of Deputies to Discuss Diplomatic Resolutions</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th - People at the Naval Conference were greatly surprised last night to learn that the French representative, Briand, had decided to return to Paris today. The British chief delegate, MacDonald, immediately arranged to meet with Briand for lengthy discussions. It is now understood that Briand may return to London with French Premier Tardieu at the end of this week.</p>
<p>Dentsu, London, 19th - At the Anglo-American expert meeting on the 19th, the tonnage allocation for France and Italy was discussed. According to reliable sources, France was set at 600,000 tons and Italy at 500,000 tons. Upon receiving this news, the French plenipotentiary expressed a strong reaction. Plenipotentiary Briand even declared his immediate return to Paris. After this matter was announced, the situation at the meeting became even more tense.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th - A spokesman for the French delegation at the Naval Conference told a Reuters representative that Foreign Minister Briand's return to Paris this morning was due to the Cabinet requesting his presence at the Chamber of Deputies for diplomatic affairs and did not imply a breakdown of the Naval Conference. There are currently two major unresolved issues at the Naval Conference: one is the deadlock between France and Italy, which requires abandoning the equality issue and proposing a practical solution; the other is the figures between France and Britain, which can only be modified after an agreement is reached on maintaining peace in Europe. He also said that French Premier Tardieu and Briand are both willing to return to London as soon as possible, but the speed of their actions depends entirely on developments in London. Finally, he said that the four powers are now in agreement on the need to formulate a shipbuilding program, but Italy alone disagrees. This is the main difficulty.</p>
<p>Developments in US-Japan Negotiations</p>
<p>Japan Delays Instructions with Reasons</p>
<p>Domei, Tokyo, 20th - The Japanese government's instructions on a compromise proposal to the United States will be decided by the Cabinet meeting on the 22nd and then sent to Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki. The reasons for the delay are generally as follows: 1. Observing the current state of the London Conference, the parallel negotiations between Britain, the United States, and Japan and between Britain, France, and Italy have recently changed to the state of the US-Japan and British-French negotiations. The relations of the five countries have actually become inseparable. In particular, the attitude of France is of great importance to Japan. Therefore, Japan should constantly pay attention to the relations between Britain and France. Given the current relations between Britain and France, Japan does not need to rush to put forward countermeasures to the US compromise proposal. It is better to carefully observe the opinions and attitudes of Britain and France before putting forward countermeasures. 2. From a certain point of view, the current instruction proposal has an important nature in determining the success or failure of the conference. Therefore, Japan should adopt a fully cautious attitude.</p>
<p>Domei, Tokyo, 20th - Naval Chief of Staff Kato visited Prime Minister Hamaguchi at 2:00 PM yesterday to exchange views on US-Japan negotiations and stated the reasons why Japan should insist on 70% of the US demands, requesting the Prime Minister's understanding. At the meeting, Naval Chief of Staff Kato seemed to propose a final solution he had in mind, namely, to review the political agreement in the Pacific and consider ways to open up the overall situation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 20th - Many Japanese believe that the US proposals at the Naval Conference cannot be accepted without modification. A Foreign Ministry spokesman today explicitly denied that the government or any government ministry has made a decision. It is expected that the Cabinet will meet on the 22nd to decide, but the reply may not be drafted until next week. According to observers, the reply will reject the current proposals but will still leave room for continued negotiations.</p>

<p>Reuters, Borsad, 19th - Gandhi spoke to the crowds in Ras today. The authorities have not yet strictly prohibited open speeches.

Gandhi warned the obligationists to fight to the end and to know that they will not receive lenient treatment after being detained. Gandhi also said that he had heard people say that if he made salt, the salt in his hands would be taken away, but although he was weak, he wanted to see how the government would take the salt from his hands.

<h3>Funeral Held for Rivera's Remains</h3>
<p>All Cabinet Members Attended to Assist with the Coffin</p>
<p>The King Did Not Participate Alone</p>
<p>Kokumin, Madrid, 19th - The funeral of the late former dictator General Rivera was held here this morning. Public and private buildings were flying flags at half-mast.

<h3>US Senate Passes Tax on Imported Silver Bullion</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 19th - This afternoon, the Senate passed a bill to tax each ounce of silver bullion at 30 cents of gold currency by a vote of 55 to 12. Many of the leading senators, because Britain strongly imposed the gold standard on India and sold Indian silver bullion indiscriminately on the world market, changed their previous position on this issue. Senator Pittman stated that adding a tax rate of 40 to 70 cents per ounce to silver bullion would cost the film industry an additional $10 million per year. In this way, silver prices may have a slightly longer outlook. Britain's act of indiscriminately selling Indian silver bullion originated from the view that it is difficult for India to be brought into line without removing Indian silver bullion. As for China, it has already begun to remedy the harm caused by the plummeting silver prices.</p>

<h3>New Weapons of Naval Warfare</h3>
<p>Armored Submarines Hide Torpedo Tubes</p>
<p>Speed and Combat Power Far Exceed Other Types</p>
<p>Invented by a German Professor</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 19th - A German industrial school professor, Mr. Frahmu, has invented a new type of submarine. It is said that its speed and combat power exceed all existing types of submarines. Its main weapon is a type of invisible torpedo that leaves no trace. The great powers do not allow Germany to build submarines, and the professor does not have the financial resources to build a model submarine. Therefore, his invention will ultimately be a plan on paper until foreign countries pay attention to it at this time. According to Professor Frahmu, his new submarine can carry four six-inch guns and has six torpedo tubes. It can also be armored and can reach a speed of 22 knots on the surface of the water. The British Oerlen-class submarine only carries one six-inch gun, travels only 15 knots, and has no armor.</p>

<h3>Five Chief Salt Merchants of Changlu Released on Bail</h3>
<p>Detained for Fourteen and a Half Months</p>
<p>To Await Summons in Beijing, Not Allowed to Travel Elsewhere</p>
<p>The Changlu Five Chief Salt Merchants Embezzlement Case, which caused a sensation for a time, was reported, and on January 9 of last year, Guo Chunlin, Li Yushi, Wang Yibao, Li Yulin, Yang Chengzhao, and the other five chief salt merchants were escorted to Beijing by the Tianjin Public Security Bureau and held in custody at the National Government's Military Advisory Office. They have been detained for fourteen and a half months to date. The National Government specially organized a Trial Committee, chaired by Chief Justice Wang Chonghui of the Judicial Yuan, to examine the files for several months. In July of last year, Zhao Daiwen, acting chairman of the committee, interrogated them four times at the Judicial Yuan. After being returned to custody, no judgment has been made. Recently, because the five chief salt merchants were old and have been detained for more than a year, many have become ill. The entire Hebei salt merchants petitioned the Salt Transport Envoy, who forwarded the petition to the Central Government, and permission was granted to release them on bail to await summons.</p>
<p>With the permission of Chief Justice Wang, they were released on bail on the 15th and are residing at the Dahua Hotel, awaiting trial and not allowed to travel elsewhere. After being released from prison, the five chief salt merchants have been touring the Jiming Temple and other scenic spots for days. A reporter from the Daily News met with the five chief salt merchants at their hotel yesterday. According to them, the reason for their detention was that someone reported them to the Central Government, and the National Government ordered the Tianjin Public Security Bureau to summon them for questioning. The day they were detained was in mid-October of the year before last. They were detained in Tianjin for two and a half months before being escorted to Beijing and held in custody at the National Government's Military Advisory Office. It was not until July of last year that Chief Justice Zhao Daiwen opened the trial four times. The three points of embezzlement that they were accused of were all matters that happened twenty years ago. The earliest that the five of them took office was only twelve years ago. During the court hearing, a lot of evidence was collected from all sides, but there was still no evidence to support the facts of the crime. They hope that the authorities will make a judgment as soon as possible to clarify the truth. (Daily News)</p>
<h3>Preparations Underway for the National Meteorological Conference</h3>
<p>Expanding the Organization of the Chinese Meteorological Association</p>
<p>Nominating Representatives for the East Asia Meteorological Conference</p>
<p>The Meteorological Institute of the Academia Sinica, in order to connect domestic meteorological research institutions, seek uniformity of meteorological terms, and report on the progress of research, is scheduled to convene a National Meteorological Conference on April 16 at Beijige. A reporter from the Daily News met with Mr. Zhuge, the secretary of the Meteorological Institute, yesterday to inquire about the progress of the conference. According to him, meteorological scholars from all over the world held a World Meteorological Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, last summer and established the World Meteorological Association. Our country originally planned to send representatives to attend, but due to the Sino-Russian negotiations and the obstruction of the Siberian Railway, they did not go. During the conference, due to the failure to understand the meteorological conditions in East Asia, the General Assembly decided to hold the East Asia Meteorological Conference in Hong Kong in May of this year to seek contact with the meteorological community in East Asia. After receiving this notice, our country convened meteorologists from nearby areas on the Winter Solstice last year to organize the Chinese Meteorological Association and resolved to convene the National Meteorological Conference again in April of this year to expand the organization and resolve matters such as nominating representatives to attend the East Asia Meteorological Conference and reporting proposals. This matter is now being handled by the Academia Sinica, which is convening representatives from the Department of Construction of various provinces, various meteorological observatories, and relevant administrative agencies. However, because the meteorological community in our country has rarely been in contact, smaller organizations are difficult to investigate for a while, so the notification has not been fully publicized. It is hoped that domestic meteorologists will actively participate at that time in order to solve various problems in the domestic meteorological community, which is a major event in our country's academic community.

<h3>The Xiang-E Railway is Destroyed by Bandits</h3>
<p>Traffic Between Wuchang and Changsha Interrupted</p>
<p>Telegraphs Also Disrupted Due to Wire Damage</p>
<p>A dispatch from Changsha states that starting from the 15th, the Xiang-E Railway between Changsha and Wuchang suddenly ceased operations. Simultaneously, telegraph communication between Xiang and E provinces was cut off, causing deep concern among the residents of the provincial capital. I, today, made a special trip to the railway and telegraph bureaus to investigate. According to Chief Yin Doyang of the Telegraph Administration Bureau, on the 15th, over a thousand communist bandits destroyed the railway and cut the telegraph wires at Guanbuqiao, Xianning County, E Province. As a result, the train from Wuchang did not arrive that day, and passenger and freight trains from Changsha dared not proceed to E Province. The Guanbuqiao stationmaster heard reports of the attack. As for the telegraph wires, the Yuezhou Telegraph Bureau has been telegraphed to dispatch personnel to repair them. Telegraph communication between Xiang and E provinces was restored at 7 PM on the 16th, but train service has not yet resumed. Continuing the investigation at the railway bureau, the Changsha East Station stationmaster stated that bandits were rampant in the areas of Xianning, Puqi, Tongshan, Tongcheng, and Chongyang in Hubei Province. On the 15th, a band of over a thousand bandits occupied Guanbuqiao in Xianning, destroying the railway and cutting the wires. Therefore, trains from Wuchang did not arrive on both the 15th and 16th. From Changsha, all long- and short-distance passenger trains were suspended on the 15th. On the morning of the 16th, a short-distance passenger train to Yueyang (Changsha to Yueyang) was dispatched once. If there are no obstacles below Yueyang, the train could proceed directly to Wuchang when a train arrives in Yueyang from Wuchang. However, at 6 PM on the 16th, a telegram was received from Yueyang stating that no trains had arrived from Wuchang, so the train remained in Yueyang, presumably because the Guanbuqiao area was still blocked by bandits. Zhang Jiewu, acting commander of the Wuchang-Changsha-Pingxiang Garrison Command, has telegraphed the province about the rampant bandit activity and damage to the railway and telegraph lines in E Province, requesting the dispatch of troops to suppress them. The telegram describes the bandit situation in detail, stating, "According to reports from various substations and inspectors of our department, bandit activity has recently flared up again in Tongcheng, Tongshan, and the Dashanping area of Chongyang. Yesterday, a battalion of the 22nd Division engaged in a fierce battle with bandits in Shanping. Due to the battalion's limited strength, it has returned to Yangloudong, Zhaoliqiao, and other places. It is also reported that Tongshan County is now occupied by bandits, and the county magistrate has taken a train to Hankou. Many personnel from various agencies in Chongyang County have also gone to Hankou to avoid the bandits. Furthermore, according to the Daily News of the 15th, the Red Bandits have departed from Chongyang and are spreading towards Tingsiqiao, Zhonghuopu, and other places. On the 13th, a band of over a hundred armed bandits was reported twenty li from Tingsiqiao, showing exceptional rampant behavior. Moreover, according to a telegram of the 16th, Guanbuqiao has been occupied by bandits, who are behaving extremely recklessly. Because the telegraph and telephone used by the station are not working, it is difficult for trains to run in either direction. We earnestly request that the military and political officers of Xiang and E provinces quickly dispatch additional troops to suppress the bandits and restore traffic, to avoid impacting everything." After reviewing the reported bandit situation, which is all within E Province, in addition to reporting it to the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters in Hankou for review and requesting a coordinated effort to add forces for suppression, we are specially submitting this telegram for your review and requesting that you immediately order the Yueyang and Linxiang stationed troops to pay attention to blocking and intercepting, in order to maintain traffic." After receiving the telegram, the General Headquarters, since General Commander He had already departed for Liling on the 14th, immediately telegraphed him to report. Mr. He returned to Changsha at 6 PM on the 16th and immediately telegraphed Brigade Commander Wang Dongyuan of the 16th Division to dispatch a regiment of troops overnight to the Yangloudong area to block and suppress the bandits. He also telegraphed Chairman He of E Province, urging him to quickly deploy troops to strictly suppress the bandits and ensure their eradication. Today, no trains arrived from Wuchang, so no trains departed from Changsha to E Province either, greatly hindering transportation. Xie Lu, a member of the Hubei Provincial Government, has completed his official duties in Xiang, but is unable to return to E Province due to the transportation disruption. (March 17th)</p>
<h3>The Lu Court Tries the Case of Liu Yaodong</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan reports that Liu Yaodong, a former brigade commander of the Provisional 1st Brigade of the 49th Division under Ren Yingqi, whose troops were stationed in the northern part of Lu Province, was arrested by the provincial government in September of last year based on accusations from the people of Gaotang. The case was transferred from the Military Law Section to the Jinan District Court. Subsequently, the prosecutor filed a public indictment, arguing that Liu disturbed the local area with his troops without permission from his superiors, and prosecuted him according to Article 164 of the Criminal Code. Today (17th) at 2 PM, the District Court held a hearing. The presiding judge was Jin Beipeng, the prosecutor was Zhang Zuozhe, the clerk was Chai Zhen, and Liu's appointed lawyer was Zhang Fangyi. The presiding judge first asked Liu his name and background. Liu replied that he was from Gaomi and formerly served as the brigade commander of the Provisional 1st Brigade of the 49th Division of the National Revolutionary Army. He was stationed in Gaotang in August of last year. Asked who commissioned him, he replied that he was commissioned by Division Commander Zhang, and the chief of staff of Ren telegraphed him to go to Jiaodong to gather his old troops. The telegrams mentioned the distribution of military uniforms. Liu then presented eight vouchers. Asked who issued the official seals, he replied that they were issued by the 49th Division. He lost them when he disbanded his troops in Gaotang last autumn. Asked when his 1st Brigade was disbanded, he replied that it was in early August of last year. Asked who issued the unit designation and military uniforms, he replied that they were issued by the 46th Division. Liu then presented supporting documents for the military uniforms. Liu also said that he had many other documents, but since Division Commander Ren had been dismissed from his position by the central government, he could not find them. Asked when the 1st Brigade was established, he replied that it was in May of the 18th year. In February, Division Commander Ren was ordered to depart from Dezhou for Jiaodong, with three brigades and eight detachments, all of which Division Commander Ren himself recruited in Jiaodong. Later, he recruited two more brigades, one commanded by Brigade Commander Zhang Shengjiu, whose troops were later disbanded in Huangxian, and the other commanded by Brigade Commander Shi Zhongcheng (now the Jinan Garrison Commander). At that time, he was the commander. It was not until May that he was commissioned as the provisional brigade commander of the 1st Brigade in Changyi. If he had not been commissioned by the 49th Division, he would not have received the pay and military uniforms. If he had not been recognized by the central government, Chairman Chiang would not have convened a meeting with our brigade and regimental commanders in Dezhou when he went to Beiping. Asked if he had the order from Chairman Chiang, he replied that it was in the staff office and was lost when he disbanded his troops in Gaotang, but he had met with Councilor Dai, who was sent by Chairman Chiang. Asked if he had notified the neighboring areas or reported to the provincial government when he started using the official seals, he replied that the provincial government was still in Taian at that time, and transportation was difficult, but Chairman Chen later sent him telegrams. Liu then presented the telegrams and said that Chairman Chen had sent him several telegrams in August of last year, but they were all lost. However, he had published a notice in the newspaper at that time, which was enough to prove that the 1st Brigade was a unit of the 49th Division. He then presented the newspaper. At this point, the presiding judge asked lawyer Zhang Fangyi to express his opinion. Zhang stood up and said that the facts of the case had been clarified by the defendant. The reason was that in February of last year, Ren Yingqi, commander of the 49th Division, was ordered by the central government to depart from Dezhou for Jiaodong, using both suppression and pacification. Therefore, Ren recruited many irregular troops in Jiaodong. At that time, the defendant was a commander. The irregular troops were pacified and absorbed by the 49th Division. In May, they were reorganized, and the defendant was appointed as the provisional brigade commander of the 1st Brigade. He led his troops stationed in Gaotang, Qihe, Gaoyuan, and other places. In the autumn, Commander Ren was transferred south. The defendant, due to his hometown ties, did not follow him south and negotiated with the provincial authorities for reorganization, which led to this case. The prosecutor based his case on Article 164 of the Criminal Code, accusing the defendant of leading troops without the permission of his superiors. "Without the permission of his superiors" naturally refers to the superiors in charge. The defendant in this case was the provisional brigade commander of the 1st Brigade of the 49th Division, not a directly subordinate unit of the central government, and has no relationship with the central government. The only proof is whether the defendant has a relationship with the 49th Division. If there is proof, the defendant's leading of troops is legal, otherwise it is illegal. Not only has the defendant presented various evidence today, but the original complaint also stated that Liu was the brigade commander of the 1st Brigade of the 49th Division, which proves that the defendant was commissioned by the 49th Division. The defendant's evidence includes: 1. The official seal has the seal of the Provisional 1st Brigade of the 49th Division. 2. The original commissioner was the quartermaster of the 49th Division, who also issued military uniforms. 3. Chairman Chen's telegram to the defendant referred to him as brigade commander. Chairman Chen even had a telegram praising Liu's brigade for its good discipline and urging him to come to negotiate reorganization. 4. The merchants of Gaotang requested an investigation into the military uniform expenses. The provincial government approved it, also referring to Liu as brigade commander, saying that he belonged to the 49th Division. 5. On July 1st, a newspaper published a notice from the people of Gaoyuan praising the Provisional 1st Brigade of the 49th Division. The defendant also published a notice prohibiting the troops from harassing the people. Even if it was one-sided, if someone impersonated the name of the 49th Division, the 49th Division would definitely come out and question it. Furthermore, the Gaotang Finance Bureau's report and the reports from various Gaotang agencies forwarded by the provincial government all referred to the defendant as the brigade commander of the Provisional 1st Brigade of the 49th Division. All kinds of evidence prove that the defendant was indeed commissioned by the 49th Division, and the 49th Division also issued pay and clothing, which proves that the defendant did not violate Article 164 of the Criminal Code. The original complaint stated that the 49th Division did not report the 1st Brigade to the central government, but whether it was reported or not is the responsibility of the 49th Division. The defendant does not bear any responsibility and has no criminal charge. Please give the defendant another opportunity to fully investigate the evidence. The presiding judge then asked the prosecutor to express his opinion. Prosecutor Zhang Zuozhe stood up and said that the army belongs to the central government. The defendant's 1st Brigade was not reported to the central government. The evidence presented can only prove that he had a relationship with the 49th Division and cannot prove that he had a relationship with the central government. Please pay attention to this, your honor. The presiding judge then ordered Liu to do his best to search for the public letter notifying neighboring districts of the use of official seals in Changyi, and all kinds of evidence. The hearing was adjourned to a later date. (17th)</p>
<h3>The Afforestation Movement in Jinan</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan reports that the Shandong Province Afforestation Movement Propaganda Conference was held at the municipal government at 10 AM today (the 16th). Personnel from various Jinan agencies, students from various schools, and various civil organizations attended, totaling over 10,000 people. The venue was the large open space in front of the municipal government. A pine arch was erected high in front of the gate, with a cloth banner hanging on it. A high platform-style colored shed was erected inside the venue, with a portrait of the Premier in the center, crossed party and national flags, and various slogans posted. From around 8 AM, attendees arrived in an endless stream, especially crowded around 9 AM. Among them, there were not a few people in simple clothes and straw sandals, showing the true colors of farmers. At 10 AM, the meeting was officially announced to begin. After performing the rituals, Chairman He Siyuan reported the purpose of the meeting, saying that today we are holding a general assembly for the afforestation movement here. We feel that afforestation is the number one thing that should be done in China. If we go from Beiping to Nanjing, we see very few trees in the cities and forests along the way. Even the largest and most famous Mount Tai does not have many trees. In foreign countries, every large city and mountain has forests dozens of miles long. China's backwardness in forestry is evident. China has few forests, so many people suffer from lung disease. Foreign countries have many forests, so few people suffer from lung disease, showing the great relationship between forests and the survival of the nation. Currently, most of the timber used in the market is American red pine and white pine. The timber produced in our country is rarely seen. Summarizing this leakage, it amounts to over 70 million yuan per year. Now that the afforestation movement has begun, whether it is the party or the people, we must work hard to implement it. If every person in China plants one tree, we can have 400 million trees a year, and China's forestry will have great hope. However, when we plant trees, we cannot plant them today and not care about them tomorrow, because if we plant them and don't care about them, it's better not to plant them. This is the biggest problem for Chinese people and must be changed. If we plant trees this year and still plant trees next year, and if we plant them today and water them tomorrow, it will not be difficult for forestry to develop. This afforestation movement is a movement for the survival of the nation, a movement to recover our rights. We continue the Premier's legacy and should actively seek the development of forestry. Next, forestry expert Han An (now a consultant to the Qingdao Municipal Government), as well as Yu Enbo, Director of the Department of Agriculture and Mining, and Zhang Hongjian, a representative of the city's party department, gave speeches in succession. The meeting adjourned with slogans at around 11 AM.</p>
<h3>A Tragedy During the 21st Army's Aircraft Bombing Demonstration</h3>
<p>Over a Hundred Attending Trainees Injured by Bombing</p>
<p>A dispatch from Chongqing reports that in order to expand his strength, Liu Xiang, commander of the 21st Army, not only purchased large quantities of weapons and ammunition to transport to Sichuan but also sent a special envoy with a large sum of money to France to purchase several fighter planes. They were recently shipped to Chongqing. An airfield was built in Guangyangba, located forty to fifty li from Chongqing, and mechanics and craftsmen were hired to assemble them as quickly as possible. The day before yesterday (the 7th), an aircraft bombing demonstration was held at the airfield. Mr. Liu, accompanied by Lou Yousan, supervised and led over a thousand trainees, along with sixty to seventy instructors from all departments, to attend the demonstration. A battery of artillery had been sent ahead to prepare for the verification. The area of Guangyangba is about six to seven hundred meters wide. The designated bombing area was at the eastern end, and the trainees and officers of the 21st Army were at the western end, with a safe distance. At 9 AM, a German pilot hired by the army boarded Aircraft No. 2 to fly, bringing several impact-detonating bombs (each weighing about half a pound). After the plane ascended, it circled once and flew toward the bombing area. Unexpectedly, just after passing the observation line, the pilot took out a bomb, held it in his hand, preparing to drive to the bombing zone and release it. However, as soon as he turned, the wind suddenly increased, the aircraft spun around, and the aircraft fan touched the elbow, a violent pat, and the bomb was thrown down, landed four or five zhang in front of the gathering place for visiting students. Immediately there was an explosion, smoke and dust filled the air, the whole venue collapsed. After the incident, an investigation revealed that over a hundred trainees had been injured by the bombing, with about two or three seriously injured and in life-threatening condition. Mr. Liu directed the rescue of the injured trainees, who were taken to the Dingyuan steamer and transported back to a hospital in Chongqing for treatment. Because the demonstration involving trainee injury by plane-dropped bomb, all of the six-pound, aircraft bombs were not re-tested for throwing. According to a certain officer who attended the demonstration, there was real good fortune that day: the bomb landed several zhang away from the observation line and had already injured over a hundred people. Had it fallen into the crowd, the damage would have been unimaginable. It was also fortunate that the test was a mortar shell, weighing only half a pound. If it had been an aircraft bomb weighing over six pounds, the explosive force could have reached five to six hundred meters in all directions, then the entire Guangyangba would have been a dangerous area. It was also fortunate that only half of the falling shell exploded, and half was intact and did not crack. Otherwise, the casualties would have been much greater than this number. (March 9th)</p>
<h3>Harbin Merchants Request the Eastern Railway to Waive Increased Freight Charges on Soybeans</h3>
<p>Soviet Russia Wants to Increase Domestic Agricultural Products</p>
<p>Plans to Increase Soybean Export Freight Charges</p>
<p>A dispatch from Harbin reports that Soviet Russia has been experimenting with planting soybeans in the western part of the country in recent years, with excellent results. Now, many of the soybean raw materials needed by Germany, France, and other countries are purchased nearby. One of the reasons for the sluggish sales of soybeans in northern Manchuria in recent years is this. Last month, a commissioner from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce came to Harbin to investigate the situation of soybean merchants in oil workshops. He stated that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had stipulated a tax-exempt export method. The Russian side, upon learning of this, believed that it would affect the sales of agricultural products and specially ordered the Eastern Railway to increase the freight charges for soybean oil cakes, in order to hinder the export of soybeans and their products from northern Manchuria. As a result, the Road Interior and Exterior Chambers of Commerce held a meeting a few days ago and decided to send a letter to the Eastern Railway Bureau, requesting that the original freight rates be maintained. The official letter was sent out yesterday, and the content is as follows: "To the Manager: Recently, there have been reports that the Eastern Railway is planning to implement an increase in freight charges for soybeans and soybean products transported eastward. Increasing the aforementioned freight charges will not only hinder the development of industry and commerce but will also impede the Eastern Railway's own interests. Our Chamber of Commerce has stated this frankly on several occasions over the years. Not only is it inappropriate to implement an increase, but even if there is such an idea, the impact would be truly unimaginable. The market in northern Manchuria is closely related to the world. Recently, financial changes in the Americas and the industrial world in Europe are facing shocks. As Europe is experiencing economic panic, its commercial situation changes, and northern Manchuria is also affected. The banking community is afraid of being caught in a whirlpool and is unwilling to provide sufficient assistance to exporters. The business of exporters is thus in decline, and the entire market in northern Manchuria is showing signs of depression. The export of special products from northern Manchuria has always been the best in the world, but in recent years, it has greatly declined. To seek the development of the market in this situation, we must first expand the export business. The export business is expanding day by day, and the market in northern Manchuria is developing day by day, and the Eastern Railway itself can exclusively enjoy its benefits. In the current situation, European soybean prices are unusually low, and soybeans from northern Manchuria cannot be transported westward and can only be transported to Japan. Therefore, the export from northern Manchuria is entirely based on Japanese market prices. If the aforementioned proposal to increase freight charges is translated from rumor into reality, it would be tantamount to cutting off the transportation route of the Eastern Railway itself and transferring its benefits to southern Manchuria. According to the investigation by industrialists, farmers in northern Manchuria have gradually reduced their production capacity in recent years because soybeans are not profitable. This is most likely to cause unimaginable damage to the market in northern Manchuria and the Eastern Railway itself. Based on this argument, the proposal to increase freight charges on soybeans and soybean products on the Eastern Railway should be immediately abandoned. In addition to submitting separate letters, we hereby respectfully request your bureau to investigate." (15th)</p>

<p>Record of Interrogation in a Case of Murder for Money: Zhu Asan, the car driver of Huang Haoqing, the owner of the Wan Yi Warehouse outside the South Gate of this county, broke into the accounting room of the warehouse with an axe on the night of the tenth of this month, intending to rob it. When the robbery failed, he injured the head of the accountant, Jiang Futong. It is learned that yesterday the Public Security Bureau brought the suspect Zhu Asan and evidence such as the axe, hat, and bloody clothes to the county for interrogation. Jiang Futong, who had recovered from his injuries, also appeared in court to confront the suspect. The trial judge, Yu, opened the court for interrogation and ordered Shen, the coroner, to verify in court that Jiang had an axe-tip-shaped wound on the back of his head. When Zhu Asan was interrogated, the suspect's confession was cunning and he firmly denied the crime. After the interrogation, Jiang Futong was ordered to return home, and Zhu Asan was detained for further investigation.</p>
<p>Continuing the Request to Abolish River Management Fees: The Jiangsu Construction Department's collection of river management fees for inland small ferries has been strongly opposed by shipping merchants in various places, and has not yet been implemented. The case has now been submitted by the central government to the Executive Yuan for review. Shipping associations in various places sent representatives to Beijing on the 18th of last month to petition the Executive Yuan. Although the outcome was satisfactory, it has been a month and a practical solution has not yet been reached. With the reorganization of the provincial government and the change of personnel in the Construction Department, shipping associations in various places, including Shanghai, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Nantong, Wujin, and Suzhou, held a joint meeting and decided to send the previously selected representatives to the provincial government and the Construction Department for petitions next Monday (24th), and decided to gather in Zhenjiang on Sunday to proceed with the matter.</p>
<p>Water Police Arrest Robbers and Escort Them to Wuxi: The Jiton Yu South Goods Store in Dongzhu Town, Yixing, was robbed on the 29th of December last year, and the small shop owner Xu Yongkun and the shop assistant Qin Bingyuan were abducted with the intention of extorting a large sum of money. After the incident was reported by the owner, Captain Huang of the Water Police Team ordered his subordinates to track down the robbers. On January 27th of this year, it was reported that the abducted persons had escaped from the bandit's den and returned home safely. However, due to the seriousness of the case, the bandits should still be severely pursued. Subsequently, the 3rd Squad of the 2nd District of the Water Police stationed in the town discovered that the bandit Guo Chuanyou, also known as Guo San, and others were hiding in the Yangshuyuan area of Changshu County. On the 9th of this month, they went to arrest him and captured the bandit Guo. After being brought back to the team, he confessed that he had robbed with the fugitive bandits Wang and Cao, and that he was responsible for guarding the two hostages, earning eighty yuan. He also confessed that the case was led by A'da from Jiangbei, who is now hiding in Dongzhu, and that the remaining bandits had all fled. After obtaining the confession, Captain Huang immediately sent police to Dongzhu to arrest them, but A'da from Jiangbei had already fled upon hearing the news, and only two suspects, Lu Xiaojin and Sang Jinshi, were apprehended. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Second Water Police District for interrogation. In addition, Zhang Pu's home in Xukou, Wuxian, who is currently the squad leader of the Mudu Defense Regiment, was robbed on the evening of the 13th of this month. A bandit was shot and killed on the spot by the town's defense regiment. The area is under the jurisdiction of the 7th Squad of the 2nd Water Police District. After the incident, Captain Li Jianxun successively arrested three bandits, He Xi, Shi Agui, and Fang Guifu. He and Shi confessed to the robbery, but Fang Guifu is only suspected. Yesterday, police were also sent to escort them to Wuxi for interrogation by the Water Police District.</p>

<p>County Government Convenes Defense Meeting: The Wuyi County Government convened a defense meeting at 2:00 PM on the 19th, and resolved the following: 1. The accounts of all defense-related revenue and expenditure from October 14, 1929 to March 18, 1930 were reviewed and approved. 2. According to the resolution of the December 9, 1929 defense meeting, there is a current deficit of 888 yuan and some change. The Director of the Finance Bureau is responsible for raising funds for subsequent defense expenses. If this year's funding is insufficient, the Finance Bureau will temporarily advance funds from next year's defense budget.</p>
<p>Raising Relief Funds for the Disaster Victims of Majishan: Majishan in the 10th District of Wuyi County is isolated in the lake. There was a severe drought last year, and the disaster was severe. Recently, several people have died of starvation. The local people have organized a disaster relief association to raise funds. The method is that calligraphers and painters will jointly contribute 1,000 pieces of calligraphy and paintings, and sell 1,000 coupons, each worth two yuan, to be used as relief funds. Rong Desheng from Wuxi also generously donated 5,000 yuan for this purpose upon hearing the news.</p>
<p>Jiangyin</p>
<p>Director of Finance Bureau Approved to Resign: Dai Yuandu, the director of the Finance Bureau, has repeatedly resigned from his position due to various financial difficulties since taking office on July 1st of last year.

<p>Thorough Investigation of Whether Rice Merchants Have Paid Dock Dues: Lin Changzong, secretary of the county government, read in the Shanghai newspaper on the 18th about the detention of rice for payment of dues before being released. Lin stated that the Standing Committee of the Chamber of Commerce, Wang Bingchu, had previously reported that Chen Jingui was commissioned by the Nantong Dada Company to purchase 500 shi of rice in Wuxi and requested permission to pass through with the accompanying ticket and passport. The county government instructed the Public Security Bureau to investigate and respond jointly with the Chamber of Commerce. Lin believed that there was no established case of collecting any dues in the locality. The newspaper reported that the merchants had paid six jiao of local dock dues. Lin was concerned that unscrupulous people might be extorting money under false pretenses. The case was important and could not be ignored. Yesterday (19th), he presented a request to the county to send personnel for thorough investigation to prevent abuse. County Magistrate Shen immediately commissioned Director Zhang of the Public Security Bureau to conduct a thorough investigation and provide a reply for review. In addition, the Chamber of Commerce held a meeting yesterday. Regarding Zou Guozhen's trip to Wuxi to purchase rice, he did not submit his passport for verification and should be dealt with by the county. Chen Jingui's request to have the rice inspected and released has not been approved for a long time. Please expedite the release of the rice to alleviate the merchants' difficulties.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>

<p>Yangzhou</p>
<p>Restoration of the Salt Administration History Editorial Office: Zhang Jiarui, the Huaiyun Envoy, stated that the "History of the Salt Laws of Huaihe River," was previously attached to the Yunshu during the tenure of former Director Yao in the second year of the Republic, and the Salt Administration History Editorial Office was established, hiring Zhu Naigeng and others to compile and revise the book. After reporting the completed book to the ministry, the office was abolished. Now, sixteen years have passed.

He specially requested and was approved to restore the Salt Administration History Editorial Office, with a fixed budget of 4,000 yuan, to be completed in six months.

<p>County Magistrate Personally Investigates the Yanghuo Road Accident Case: Chen Nanxuan, the county magistrate of Jiangdu, followed the instructions of the Construction Department to handle the Yanghuo Road Section 5 accident case. On the morning of the 19th, he accompanied Yang Shihai, the training minister of the Consolidation Committee, and Wang Zhenyu, the standing committee member of the Agricultural Consolidation Committee, to investigate. All section chiefs, directors, and landlords who had previously come to Yangzhou to seek refuge in Jiangbei hostels to avoid trouble, as well as the five victims, including Sun, Chen, Xu, and Dong, who had their houses destroyed, also returned to their hometowns to await inquiries.</p>
<p>Acting Director Urges Payment of Donations: After Ling Fang'an, the Director of the Education Bureau, resigned, the county selected and guaranteed a candidate according to regulations and submitted it to the department for selection and appointment. However, the school and education associations discussed the candidate from various angles and demanded perfection, making it difficult for the authorities to announce the appointment. Currently, no one is responsible, and education funds are lacking. Therefore, the county commissioned Gu Peiyuan, the school inspector, to temporarily act as the director. It is now heard that because education funds are too tight, he is trying to raise funds from all sides. Therefore, the bureau sent a letter to the Buddhist Association, ordering all temples to pay the approved Jingchan donations according to regulations.</p>
<p>Nantong</p>
<p>Collapse of Wanggang Embankment: The embankment in the Wanggang area of Nantong is being eroded by high tides, with five places collapsing.

The county government, considering the flood disaster, specially convened representatives from all walks of life to discuss relief measures.</p>
<p>Deadline for Returning Excess Reclaimed Land: The Department of Agriculture and Mining ordered the Nantong County Government to order the Dayoujin Salt Reclamation Company to return 100,000 mu of excess reclaimed land within two months to open a cotton field in the reclaimed area. County Magistrate Chen has ordered the company to comply.</p>
<p>Urging the Collection of Education Taxes: The Nantong County Education Bureau stated that the surcharge and collected education taxes for the 18th year should total 151,756 yuan. Recently, only more than 123,000 yuan has been received, leaving a large shortfall. It has now submitted a request to the county government to order the Finance Bureau to collect and disburse the funds due to the need to distribute regular expenses.</p>
<p>Huzhou</p>

After some time, they found Luo's son in the outdoor haystack, tied him up, and left.</p>
<p>Jiashan</p>
<p>Change of County Magistrate: County Magistrate Wu Yingquan's handling of affairs was slow.

He has now been dismissed by the province due to a certain matter, and his vacancy has been filled by Shen Rongguang.</p>
<p>Cracking Down on Opium Dens: Li Shaoqing in Niuchang Alley in the city has been selling lamps and opium for some time.

<p>Approval of the Waterworks Bond Regulations: The second phase of the Hangzhou Waterworks Bonds has begun to be promoted. The bond regulations were submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review.

<p>Ningbo</p>
<p>Yongkang Exchange Shop Robbed: The Yongkang tobacco and paper exchange shop next to the Haishen Temple in Yong City and Quanjiawan was robbed at around 6:00 AM yesterday morning.

Fearing accidents, they asked the Lishe to send six members of the defense militia to protect the house. Unexpectedly, the militiamen were patrolling in front of Feng's house that night when eight bandits suddenly appeared. One bandit took out a wooden pistol and ordered them to surrender their weapons. The other militiamen did not dare to resist. All three wooden pistols and three quick-firing rifles were seized by the bandits. After obtaining the firearms, the bandits went to Zhangjatan, about three li away from Feng Zifan's house, and broke into Zhang's house with stones, looting extensively. It is said that more than 100 yuan in cash was robbed, and the loot was carried away. Fortunately, Feng Zifan's house was not robbed.</p>

Subsequently, the Public Security Bureau arrested the two bandits in the case, Yuan Nanzhao and Xing Jianxiong. Yuan was sentenced to death for murder, and Xing was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for joint murder. The defendants appealed, but the prosecutor of the High Court believed that the evidence against Yuan Nanzhao was clear and rejected the appeal, and he was still sentenced to death. Xing Jianxiong's appeal was found to have some justification, and his sentence was partially changed, reduced by five years, and sentenced to ten years of imprisonment. The execution will take place soon.</p>
<p>Bride Dies in Sedan Chair: The daughter of Cheng Yuanjin, a resident of Waisha, Xiaoshan, was betrothed to Ye Ade, a resident of Qibao Village outside Taipingmen, Hangzhou.

<h3>National Games Shanghai Delegation</h3>

<p>Chen Dezheng as Chief Representative</p>
<p>Jiang Xiangqing as Head Coach</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality delegation for the National Games has been organized and reported yesterday. With vigorous spirit, they are determined to win the championship. However, the position of Chief Representative is of great importance. It has been decided that Mr. Chen Dezheng, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, will take the post himself to oversee the entire operation. From now on, internal and external command will be in capable hands, and the upcoming mobilization will surely be smooth and successful. Director Chen also appointed Jiang Xiangqing as Head Coach last night to assist him.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the leaders are scheduled to hold a meeting at 5:00 PM today at the Da Zhonghua Restaurant in the Old West Gate to discuss training arrangements. Coaches, staff, general managers, office directors, secretaries, and accountants from each team are required to attend. The meeting will cover expenses, equipment, uniforms, notification letters, press releases, and departure procedures for the athletes. Jiang Xiangqing will be traveling to Hangzhou tomorrow morning on the 9:10 train to register. After that, all responsibilities related to the athletes will be delegated to the coaches and staff.</p>
<p>Awards Ceremony Details</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Games, which began on the 11th and lasted for seven days, was an unprecedented event in the city's sports scene. The awards ceremony was held at the Commercial &amp; Savings Bank yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM. Mayor Zhang and his wife, Director Chen of the Education Bureau, committee members, staff, and athletes, totaling over 600 people, attended. Mayor Zhang and Director Chen presided over the ceremony, with Yao Gengkui as the recording secretary.</p>
<p>The stage was filled with prizes. The various prizes collected for the event were extremely rich, especially the Yuejun Shield presented by Mayor Zhang, the Shanghai Shield by the Director of the Education Bureau, and the Dezheng Shield by Director Chen, which were particularly magnificent. In addition, there were no fewer than a hundred shields, flags, and display cabinets, all gilded and splendid.</p>
<p>Chairman Chen Dezheng delivered a speech. After the formal greetings, Chairman Chen Dezheng gave a speech, stating: "Distinguished officials, event staff, and athletes, the first Shanghai Municipal Games, which lasted for seven days, was well-organized and executed, delighting the Mayor and the organizers. The results were very satisfying. We must first thank the committee members, as their efforts were crucial to this success. This first Municipal Games saw the participation of many outstanding talents, and we are optimistic about the future. This event serves as a preliminary selection for the National Games, which in turn serves as preparation for the Far Eastern Games. Therefore, each athlete bears a significant responsibility. Our city's athletes are strong. After this selection, I hope you will work even harder to achieve a superior position in the National Games and, further, win glory for the nation in the Far Eastern Games. If any athletes are unable to go to Hangzhou due to schoolwork or other commitments, the Bureau will do its best to find solutions to alleviate these difficulties and work together to bring honor to our city. There are many prizes for you today, especially from the Mayor. This is a commemoration of your hard work. Please cherish them."</p>
<p>The Awards Ceremony. The distribution of awards began, including trophies for the champions and runners-up of various sports and the top four in each track and field event, presented one by one by the Mayor's wife. The atmosphere was filled with cheers. Wu Jiyi received the most awards. Other winners were listed in yesterday's newspaper and will not be repeated here.</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang's Admonitory Speech. After the awards were presented, Mayor Zhang delivered an admonitory speech, stating: "Life is a matter of decades. Occupying a position in time and space means taking on responsibilities for the country and society and fulfilling one's duties. However, whatever endeavor one undertakes, a sound body and a complete spirit are fundamental. If the foundation is not solid, the endeavor cannot go far. The purpose of the country and society promoting sports is to strengthen the people's physique and invigorate their spirit. With one part of spirit, there is one part of endeavor. With ten parts of physique, one can fulfill ten parts of responsibility. Spirit and physique are mutually causal. With a healthy body, there is a complete spirit. The apparent result of sports events is a strong physique, but in reality, a strong physique naturally leads to an invigorated spirit. However, the training of the physique and the training of the spirit must be given equal attention. One cannot be emphasized over the other, and the effects achieved will naturally be better and more perfect. Whether ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, the way to establish a nation and the process of social evolution both emphasize national physical education. For example, the militaristic democracy advocated by Germany in the past, the Japanese Bushido, and the promotion and improvement of other sports methods are constantly progressing. They not only improve the people's spirit and physique internally but can also defend against external insults. The same was true in ancient China. The Great Learning regards the investigation of things, the extension of knowledge, the sincerity of the will, the rectification of the heart, the cultivation of the personal life, the regulation of the family, the governance of the state, and the pacification of the world as a coherent pursuit, and from the Son of Heaven down to the common people, all regard the cultivation of the personal life as fundamental. What is meant by cultivating the personal life? It means cultivating the spirit and physique. If the people's spirit and physique can be given attention and cultivation, they will naturally become healthier and stronger day by day. On the negative side, it can reduce illness and suffering; on the positive side, it can enable one to undertake great endeavors. Society is composed of individual citizens, and when the individual citizens are healthy, society is naturally peaceful, and all customs are naturally perfect. The nation is based on the people, and when the people are physically strong and mentally vigorous, the nation will naturally be strong. In this era of rampant imperialism, all of us citizens should train our physique and spirit, in accordance with the ancient principles of cultivating the body and mind, to stabilize our society, strengthen our nation, wash away the shame of the former old and great empire, and alleviate the suffering of modern weak and small nations, so that the terms "old and great empire" and "weak and small nations" will no longer enter our ears. This Shanghai Municipal Games has already shown considerable results, but due to the short preparation period and the lack of funding, it has not been fully developed. However, this performance has already given the city a very good impression. Now, there are only ten days until the National Games. I hope you will practice well and prepare thoroughly so that you can shine at the National Games and leave an excellent impression on the people of the country, making a significant contribution to the health of our nation's spirit and physique. This is what I hope for and what pleases me."</p>
<p>The Mayor's Wife's Speech. She stated: "I am deeply honored to be present at the awards ceremony of the Shanghai Municipal Games today. This event is unprecedented in our city. I heard that the preparation time for the Games was short and the funding was limited, but the results after the event were excellent, which is truly gratifying. Although the Games have ended, the athletes will go to Hangzhou to compete in the National Games for our city, and then to the Far Eastern Games for the country and the nation. Therefore, the mission you bear is very important. Today's awards ceremony will leave a victory for each athlete to remember, and it also makes me feel very happy. I wish you all the best in the future." After the speech, the meeting adjourned amidst enthusiastic applause.</p>
<p>The prizes presented by various organizations to the winners of various sports were listed in yesterday's newspaper. In addition, the Republic Daily presented a "May Our Might Prevail" silver trophy to Cao Yu, the first place winner in the decathlon; the Municipal Education Bureau presented a "Heroine" silver trophy to Zhang Biru, the overall first place winner in women's track and field; and the Municipal Sports Field presented a framed picture to the Southeast Team, the runner-up in women's basketball.</p>

<p>The atmosphere was extremely lively as both sides' male and female students came to cheer on the two teams yesterday. The referees were Zhang Huilan and Du Tingxiu. In the first half, Suzhou Women's High School led 23 to 11.</p>
<p>For a while, the score was tied. Sun Shuquan of Suzhou High, tall and graceful, had the advantage in center jumps. At the beginning of the game, Suzhou High passed and attacked, and Sun threw the ball with both hands, scoring immediately. After the score was opened, Dongwu launched a counterattack. Soon, Qiang Jie also scored a goal, tying the score. At that time, the strengths of the two sides were evenly matched, and they held each other in check. However, Suzhou High's coordination and passing were superior, and Suzhou High led 8 to 5 in the first quarter.</p>
<p>The difference gradually widened. Starting from the second quarter, the forwards of Suzhou High were agile and extraordinary. Their movements were awe-inspiring. The guards of Dongwu tried their best to resist, but it was of no use. In the blink of an eye, Zhang Yingfen and Sun Shuquan of Suzhou High each scored a goal. After that, although Dongwu made some gains, they were mostly under the pressure of the opponent and had little room for development. In the first half, Suzhou High led 23 to Dongwu 11.</p>
<p>Even more exciting. In the third quarter, the internal and external performances of Suzhou High were even more exciting. Scoring was as easy as taking things out of a bag. Dongwu was at its best, while the others showed signs of unease. Suzhou High scored 12 and Dongwu scored 2 in this quarter.</p>
<p>Taking the lead. At that time, Suzhou High's momentum was extremely high and their spirits were even higher. The students at the venue witnessed their imminent success, and they all raised their eyebrows and shouted with joy. Suddenly, one player from Dongwu was fouled out and no one replaced her, so they had to fight with five players. The result was slightly better than before, but the overall situation was irreversible. Suzhou High finally won 49 to 16, taking the lead.</p>

<h3>Dongwu Wins Women's Tennis Championship</h3>
<p>Doubles: Dongwu defeats Beijing Women's High School</p>

<p>In the women's tennis final, Liu Xufen and Zhang Chi of Dongwu defeated Mao Yuwen and Cao Xiu'e of Beijing Women's High School 6-2, 6-0. The referee was Yu Zhizhong. Liu and Zhang were physically strong and had powerful serves. Liu's ball was even better. Mao Yuwen of Beijing Women's High School was steady in receiving the ball and made no mistakes. Unfortunately, Cao was too weak, and they could not coordinate in doubles. Cao's skills were superior to Zhang's, and Mao's skills were superior to Liu's. Liu's serving posture was not good and was a flaw. However, Liu and Zhang's skills were more balanced, and Mao defended almost alone, leading to their defeat by Liu and Zhang.</p>
<p>In the singles, Liu Xuzang of Dongwu defeated Cao Xiu'e of Beijing Women's High School 6-3, 6-0. In another match, Mao Yuwen of Beijing Women's High School defeated Zhang Jie 6-2, 6-4. As a result, Dongwu won the women's tennis championship 2-1.</p>

The Pittsburgh team's strength: While stationed in the Philippines, they defeated the local basketball team preparing to attend the Far Eastern Games, demonstrating their robust capabilities. Now, returning with a sense of unfulfilled potential, they have issued a formal challenge to the Chinese team, who won this year's International Basketball Championship, for a "revenge" match. Both sides have agreed to the terms of the battle, adopting a best-of-three series to determine the winner, with the Association presenting a silver cup to the victor as a trophy and encouragement.</p>

<h3>Today's Commemoration of Shanghai's Recovery</h3>
<p>Held at the City Party Headquarters at 9 AM</p>
<p>Today is the glorious anniversary of the National Revolutionary Army's recovery of Shanghai in 1927 (Republic of China Year 16), a major commemorative day for all Shanghai citizens who fought hand-to-hand against the Northern Warlords and broke free from their rule. Recalling that in July 1926 (Republic of China Year 15), our Party launched the Northern Expedition from Guangdong, despite numerous conspiracies and obstructions by the Communist Party and all other counter-revolutionary forces, we ultimately relied on the spirit of our late leader, the loyalty and bravery of Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, and the concerted efforts of our soldiers. On March 20th of the following year, our army reached Longhua, and the rebellious forces, unable to resist, retreated. Thus, Shanghai, the most important city in the country, was completely recovered by our army. This event is a great commemoration for Shanghai.

<h3>Chairman Chiang Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government, accompanied by Vice Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan and a 200-person guard, departed from Nanjing yesterday morning aboard the military vessels Chuyu and Chutai, inspecting the fortresses of Zhenjiang and Wusong, as well as the troops stationed along the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways. It is reported that Chairman Chiang is expected to arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng Scheduled to Depart for the North Today</h3>
<p>To Meet with Zhang Xueliang in Liaoning</p>
<p>Central Committee member Wu Tiecheng, on the orders of Chairman Chiang, will travel to Liaoning to meet with Zhang Xueliang and discuss all matters.

After arriving in Liaoning, he will stay for approximately two weeks before returning to Nanjing to report back.</p>
<h3>The Ordeal of Yangtze River Shipping</h3>
<p>Upstream Vessels Heavily Delayed</p>
<p>Sichuan Shipping Route Blocked: In recent years, since British and Japanese merchant ships crowded out Chinese shipping companies on the Chongqing route along the Yangtze River, foreign vessels have dominated the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Chinese ships did not resume service throughout the entire year of last year, and the route is still controlled by British, Japanese, and American shipping companies. This year, the water level on the upper reaches of the river rose in late February, and British, Japanese, and American ships resumed service along the Chongqing-Yichang route. At this time, when goods from the lower reaches were crowding into Sichuan, the river pilots on the Yichang to Chongqing routes (all Chinese) demanded a threefold increase in their salaries due to the rising cost of living. The shipping companies refused, and the pilots went on strike. The river channels of Sichuan are the most difficult to navigate, and only local people can serve as pilots. Therefore, the strike has dealt a major blow to foreign ships on the Sichuan River. Shipping to Chongqing has been completely blocked. Currently, goods shipped from Shanghai to Chongqing, Xuyong, and Luzhou can only be unloaded in Yichang and cannot be transported further upstream.</p>
<p>Difficulties for River Vessels in Yichang: Following the incident in which the Jianglun Company's upstream vessel Qiping was attacked by bandits, resulting in the deaths of six Chinese, two more incidents of river vessels being attacked have occurred recently. In one incident, a Chinese merchant ship was attacked by over 200 bandits firing guns at the ship 30 li downstream from Shashi, killing two crew members. In another incident, a Japanese river vessel was attacked, but fortunately, no one was injured. The Nissin Company in Shanghai received a telegram from the upper reaches stating that recently, ships traveling to Yichang were unable to proceed upstream due to a large number of bandits plotting harm and had to return to Hankou. Navigation on the upstream route has become difficult.</p>
<p>Chang'an and Dexing Suspended Again: The Chang'an and Dexing vessels of the Sanbei Company have been suspended for nearly five months. After repeated consultations, they were finally released to Shanghai. The Chang'an vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday and was fully loaded with cargo for shipment to Hankou. The Dexing vessel, although released, has not yet arrived in Shanghai and is scheduled to resume service next Monday. Unexpectedly, a telegram arrived in Shanghai yesterday ordering the two vessels to cease commercial service and prohibiting them from freely traveling to and from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Recent State of Trade on the Yangtze River: Trade on the Yangtze River in February was not as good as in January. According to a survey, the value of imported goods along the Yangtze River last month was 58 million yuan, while the value of exported goods was 34 million yuan. Japanese cotton yarn and cloth accounted for 28,000 pieces, and Javanese and Japanese sugar accounted for 1 million bags.</p>

<h3>Minutes of the Preparatory Meeting for the National Silk Exhibition</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, the second preparatory meeting for the National Silk Exhibition was held at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. Representatives from the silk industry and national products organizations, including Wang Xiaolai, Ye Huijun, Yang Duo, Lin Kanghou, Wang Hanqiang, Chen Yiting, Wu Zhihao, Wang Jie'an, Chen Diexian, Lu Xingzhuang, Zhang Hongsun, Shu Peizhi, Pan Dechun, Xu Dinglan, and Lin Zhimao, among dozens of others, attended. Wang Xiaolai was elected chairman, and Zhu Boyuan served as secretary. The meeting proceeded as planned. The chairman delivered an opening speech, stating that silk is related to clothing, one of the three necessities of life. Aside from natural silk, it is difficult for other fabrics and daily necessities to be entirely domestic products. Only natural silk can be called a purely domestic product, representing a true glimmer of hope. He urged everyone to pay attention to it. Yang Duo, curator of the National Products Exhibition Hall in the capital, then reported on the progress of the silk exhibition preparation, stating that the realization of the exhibition depends on the support of the silk industry representatives. The National Products Exhibition Hall will be reorganized and expanded during this period, and there are plans to purchase 300 mu of land in the capital to construct a national products manufacturer cooperative market, which will require the support of the national products industry in the future. Regarding methods of collecting exhibits, he suggested two options: 1. Directly collect exhibits from factories and transport them to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Product Exhibition Hall; 2. Indirectly have factories send representatives to deliver exhibits for display or sale. Ye Huijun, Lin Kanghou, Chen Diexian, Wu Zhihao, and others also gave speeches. The details are omitted for brevity. The following resolutions were also passed: 1. The Shanghai collection point for the National Silk Exhibition will be located at the local Product Exhibition Hall. 2. The opening date has been changed to May 5th. 3. Regulations for participating items: (A) Silk products participate in the Silk Exhibition; (B) Miscellaneous items participate in the National Products Market. 4. Standards for silk exhibition exhibits: (A) Natural silk fabrics; (B) Rayon interlaced fabrics should be clearly stated by the producers in the descriptions and labels for separate exhibition. 5. The deadline for exhibit collection is set for April 20th. 6. An executive committee will be organized. Wang Yansong, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Chen Yiting, Wang Jie'an, Wang Hanqiang, Lu Xingzhuang, Zhu Mouxian, Ye Huijun, Wang Jinchen, and Lu Zhengbing were elected as executive committee members, and Lin Zhimao was elected director of the Shanghai collection point, with Pan Dechun and Xu Dinglan as deputy directors. The meeting adjourned after refreshments and a group photo.</p>
<h3>Yang Guangshun Postpones Trip Abroad</h3>
<p>Rescheduled to Early Next Month, Itinerary Remains the Same</p>
<p>Yang Guangshun, a special commissioner dispatched by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inspect Europe and America, was originally scheduled to sail aboard the Canadian Empress ship on March 22nd to Seattle. However, Mr. Yang's official duties in previous positions have been completed, but there are still unresolved private matters, making it difficult to depart as scheduled. It is reported that he has rescheduled his departure from Shanghai to the United States for early next month, with the original itinerary to visit the United States first and then travel to various European countries for inspection remaining unchanged.</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi Returned to Native Place Yesterday to Visit Relatives</h3>
<p>Liu Xichang Travels to Belgium First to Prepare</p>
<p>Chu Minyi, our country's representative to the competition, is scheduled to depart for Belgium on April 5th. He recently attended the provincial sports meet in Zhenjiang, serving as the director of the prize department and presiding over the health exercise competition invented by the Chu family. He completed his duties and returned to Shanghai by train the day before yesterday (19th). Yesterday morning, because his father was ill at home, he returned to Keli, Huzhou, to visit his relatives. He will return to Shanghai within a few days to prepare for the competition. As for Liu Xichang, the deputy representative to the competition, he returned to Shanghai from Beiping the day before yesterday and will travel to Belgium before Chu to prepare everything.</p>
<h3>Electrical Expert Zou Fusong Scheduled to Travel to Belgium</h3>
<p>Taking Self-Made Electrotherapy Machine to the Competition</p>
<p>Plans to Set Up Factory in Shanghai for Manufacturing After Returning to China</p>
<p>Electrical expert Zou Fusong's self-made new high-density and diathermy machine can treat hundreds of diseases. On December 1st of last year, he was invited by Central Committee member Chu Minyi to conduct a trial at Mr. Chu's residence, which was very successful. He will now travel to Belgium on April 5th with Chu, taking various self-made machines to exhibit at the Belgian Exposition. Mr. Zou is a native of Meixian, Guangdong, who never attended school. At the age of fourteen, he went to Singapore in Nanyang to work in a factory, learning to repair machines. He has lived in Singapore for 25 years, and his success is truly amazing. Regardless of whether it is German, French, or British electrical machinery, Mr. Zou can repair, imitate, and improve it. He can also self-manufacture more than one hundred kinds of electrical machinery and is particularly devoted to inventing various electrical machinery for medical applications. When inventing a machine, he would contemplate for three or four days, forgetting sleep and food, only consuming a small amount of milk to relieve hunger and thirst until he fully understood it. His wife often assists him in his work. Mr. Zou has been in Shanghai for a year. The new high-density machine he is taking to Belgium is four feet high and two feet wide and long. If purchased from abroad, a machine of this type would cost more than 2,000 yuan, but Mr. Zou's machine only costs one to two hundred yuan to produce. It has been proven to be very suitable by Chinese and foreign doctors. It is reported that after returning from Belgium, Mr. Zou plans to establish a manufacturing factory in Shanghai to promote domestically produced machinery.</p>
<h3>Representatives to the World Power Conference Scheduled to Sail</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Sail from Shanghai to Germany in Mid-April</p>
<p>Mechanical engineering circles in various countries around the world have organized the World Power Conference to study the power industry in various countries and have established branches in various countries. The Chinese side also announced its establishment last summer and appointed representatives to attend the World Power Conference held in Japan last September. This year, the second conference will be held in Berlin, Germany, in June. The three special municipalities of Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hankou have jointly nominated Huang Boqiao, director of the Shanghai Municipal Government Public Works Bureau, to attend, and the Power Branch has approved it. As for the representatives of the branch, the meeting decided to jointly nominate Wang Shenshan, Wu Jian, and Wang Jitong to attend. Since Wang Jitong was unable to travel to Germany due to other commitments, one person from Wu Keyu and Zhang Kezhi will be selected to arrive in Shanghai in mid-April and sail with Mr. Huang to the conference. Before the opening of the conference, the representatives will visit Germany's seven major industrial zones. At this conference, in addition to reporting on and researching the power situation of each country, any issues related to power that have a common promotional nature will be submitted for public decision and followed unanimously to alleviate future fears about power, such as methods to alleviate the shortage of coal and oil, which are the most important energy sources. These will be the most important proposals on the agenda of the conference.</p>

<h3>The Commencement Date for Revising the Sino-American Aviation Contract is Undetermined</h3>
<p>Negotiations to be held in Shanghai in the Near Future</p>
<p>Yesterday, various newspapers reported that the Sino-American aviation contract would be revised in Shanghai yesterday. However, this reporter visited an important official at the Shanghai office of China National Aviation Corporation yesterday at 3 p.m. According to him, Mr. Poling, the representative of American Airways, has been in Shanghai for several days. However, he is just a regular representative, not the chairman of the company, and is staying at the Cathay Hotel, not the Astor House. Minister of Transportation Wei Xingfu has not yet arrived in Shanghai to meet with him, so there is no talk of a meeting. What the newspapers reported is absolutely untrue. As for when the revision of the contract will begin, it has not yet been decided. Whether the location will be in Nanjing or Shanghai is also still under discussion.</p>
<h3>All Industry and Commerce Associations Should Abide by the Newly Promulgated Public Association Law</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce Replies to the Commerce Reorganization Committee</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Merchant Organization Reorganization Committee: Regarding the existing organizations in the city, although their purposes comply with the Industry and Commerce Association Law, they were all organized according to separate regulations of other ministries at the time of their establishment. Should they be ordered to reorganize according to law, or should their validity be recognized? A telegram was sent to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for instructions. The original submission and the ministry's reply are recorded below: 1. (Original Submission) Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Nanjing: Regarding Article 14 of the Industry and Commerce Association Law, it stipulates that all existing industry and commerce associations established before the implementation of this law, regardless of whether they use the names of public offices, guilds, halls, or other names, if their purposes comply with Article 2 of this law, shall be regarded as industry associations established in accordance with this law and should be reorganized in accordance with this law within one year after the implementation of this law, etc. The regulations are very clear. However, the situation in this city is complex. There are organizations whose purposes comply with Article 2 of this law, but tracing back to their history at the time of establishment, they were organized in accordance with separate regulations promulgated by other ministries. Should these organizations be ordered to reorganize in accordance with Article 14 of the Industry and Commerce Association Law, or should the previous separate regulations be recognized, still</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Should they be allowed to continue to be valid? The applicable regulations are undoubtedly questionable. When the subordinate associations began to reorganize, there were many difficulties. This was brought up for discussion at the 39th Standing Committee meeting on the 26th of this month. It was resolved to send a telegram to the Ministry for instructions. The case is recorded and telegraphed. We respectfully request a prompt reply for compliance, which would be in the public interest. The Shanghai Special Municipality Merchant Organization Reorganization Committee. 1. (Reply from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce) The telegram has been received. The Industry and Commerce Association Law was promulgated by the National Government's clear order. All industry and commerce associations in the Republic of China should abide by it uniformly. Even if due to the nature of each industry, there are unavoidable circumstances where new and old separate regulations must be applied, it should still be determined that they do not conflict with this law. Regarding the situation mentioned in the telegram, you should comply with this instruction. This is the reply.</p>
<h3>Huang Jiahui Talks About the Opium Disaster in the Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>A Page of Blood and Tears, a Heartbreaking Reality</p>
<p>Huang Jiahui, the Secretary-General of the Chinese National Anti-Opium Association, was previously dispatched by the Executive Committee of the Association to the British and Dutch territories in Southeast Asia to promote the anti-opium movement among overseas Chinese and to investigate the opium poisoning situation among local Chinese and the opium monopoly system of the British and Dutch colonial governments. Mr. Huang returned to Shanghai on the 17th of this month, as reported in the previous newspapers. Yesterday, he reported the findings of his investigation and the progress of the anti-opium movement at the regular meeting of the Executive Department of the Association. He said that the places he visited included more than ten locations in the British and Dutch territories, such as Singapore, Surabaya, Batavia, Semarang, and Penang. The local Chinese communities welcomed Mr. Huang warmly upon his arrival. The Chinese residing in the Dutch East Indies have been living there for nearly a thousand years. According to the latest statistics, the number of people reaches 959,594. The number of opium smokers is 89,818, which accounts for about one-tenth of the entire Chinese population. In the entire year of 1928, a total of 1,200,5359 taels of opium were smoked. According to statistics, 19,552 people held licenses to smoke opium, consuming 337,011 taels and 4.9 mace of opium in the entire year. 70,266 people did not hold licenses, consuming 868,347 taels and 5.2 mace of opium. The price per tael varied depending on the location, ranging from 25 to 30 Dutch guilders. Calculating at 25 guilders per tael, the total loss reached 30,134,000 guilders. Each guilder is equivalent to more than 1.1 silver yuan in Shanghai. According to the local opium monopoly bureau, the total sales of raw opium in 1928 were 1,600,966 taels and 6.5 mace, worth 42,827,106 guilders and 8.5 cents. The amount smoked by the Chinese accounts for 75% of the total amount of raw opium, and the private smoking of private opium is not included. According to Mr. Huang's investigation, the number of smokers accounts for at least 15% of the entire Chinese population, of which 75% became addicted after arriving in the Dutch East Indies. Furthermore, the total number of indigenous people in the Dutch East Indies is 51,524,438, and the number of smokers is only 96,296, accounting for less than two people per thousand. They consume only 395,507 taels and 4.2 mace of opium. The average opium consumption per Chinese is 13 taels and 5 mace, while the average opium consumption per indigenous person is only 4 taels and 2 mace per year. The difference is so significant. It is also found that the number of Chinese opium smokers is the largest among workers. In eastern Sumatra, there are only over 110,000 Chinese, but more than 45,000 are addicted to opium. The number is truly alarming. Because these workers are mostly indentured laborers, they have contracts with the factories, and their income is not enough to cover their expenses. The foremen and factories often lend silver coins to the workers for their opium needs, causing these workers to be trapped by their addiction, numbing their nature, and being bound by debt for a long time, forever serving as slaves and beasts of burden, unable to escape and dying in foreign lands. The Dutch East Indies government has a large-scale opium factory in Batavia, established in 1901. There are currently 700 workers in the factory, and they use new-style machines to manufacture opium. The equipment is perfect and the best in the world. The factory is also equipped with railways that connect to railways in various places, making transportation fast and unprecedented. Opium is packaged in tin tubes for sale. The machines used to package the opium are similar to those used to load bullets, with different capacities depending on the size of the tube. The opium residue after smoking is collected by the factory and used as material for manufacturing opium because the residue can give the manufactured opium a good taste, making smokers addicted to it. The manufactured opium paste is stored in the factory for more than six months before being sold to avoid excessive heat that may affect the taste. The planning is so thorough. The factory usually stores enough opium paste to meet the needs of the entire territory for eight months, worth more than 30 million yuan. The authorities in Singapore and Siam are eager to imitate the establishment of this factory. Singapore has already started to imitate and improve its original opium factory. The King of Siam has also visited it in person. It is feared that this kind of opium factory will soon be established there as well. Mr. Huang believes that promoting the anti-opium movement is the only way to remedy the opium poisoning problem among the Chinese. Therefore, he contacted Chinese organizations and enthusiastic individuals wherever he went and vigorously promoted it. Currently, anti-opium associations have been organized in Medan and Bandung. Preparations are already underway in Yogyakarta and Semarang. Batavia and Surabaya are also in the process of preparing for it. Enthusiastic people in Dutch society have also established anti-opium associations in Batavia and Bandung to help the Chinese quit smoking. Chinese in Medan, Bandung, Batavia, and other places are raising funds to establish anti-opium hospitals. Chinese in Yogyakarta have already raised funds and plan to establish an anti-opium association and hospital. They have entrusted the Chinese National Anti-Opium Association to transfer funds and invite executives to preside over everything. Chinese organizations and knowledgeable people are very enthusiastic about anti-opium. When the International Far Eastern Investigation Team arrived earlier, the local Chinese expressed serious concerns, hoping that the opium ban would be implemented soon. The Chinese National Anti-Opium Association is now actively conducting overseas work to achieve the opium ban for the Chinese. The association will successively release information about the opium situation in British Southeast Asia to the people of the country. It is heard that Mr. Huang has obtained very rich materials during this trip and is currently organizing them. They will first be published in the Anti-Opium Monthly and then published as a special book.</p>
<h3>The Issuance of Disaster Relief Bonds is Expected Soon</h3>
<p>Issuing Bonds One Day Earlier: Saving Disaster Victims One Day Earlier</p>
<p>Chairman Xu Jingren of the Disaster Relief Committee and Standing Committee Member Mr. Wang Yiting believe that the disaster situation in various provinces is becoming more serious every day, and spring relief is particularly urgent. They have repeatedly requested the Executive Yuan to expedite the issuance of disaster relief bonds worth 10 million yuan. On the 19th of this month, they received instructions from the Executive Yuan that the 61st Executive Meeting resolved that the disaster relief bonds should be promptly prepared by the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance has been notified. Immediately, Xu and Wang telegraphed Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance, requesting prompt preparation and issuance. They believe that the Ministry of Finance will be able to uphold the National Government's intention to relieve disaster victims and issue the bonds on a specific date, and will not hesitate again on the grounds of the fund issue. It is heard that Mr. Xu is scheduled to enter Nanjing in the coming days to visit Chairman Jiang, President Tan, Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance, and Vice Ministers Zhang and Li again, earnestly requesting the immediate issuance of disaster relief bonds. The telegram to the Ministry of Finance is recorded below: Minister Song Ziwen, Vice Minister Zhang Yongni, and Vice Minister Li Diaoheng of the Ministry of Finance, Nanjing: Recently, instructions were received from the Executive Yuan that the disaster relief bonds have been resolved to be promptly prepared by your ministry. The spring relief in various provinces is urgent. Jiang, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, and other provinces are in dire need of relief, especially the disaster victims in Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Suiyuan, where thousands are starving to death every day. Relief telegrams and appeals from representatives are pouring in, describing the disaster situation, which is unbearable to hear. It is earnestly requested that the aforementioned disaster relief bonds be implemented by your ministry on a specific date, and please do not delay any longer. Please also allocate the outstanding 800,000 yuan of war zone relief funds in the form of compiled and organized treasury bonds first, so that they can be converted into cash and remitted to Commissioner Li Huanying of our association stationed in Henan to expedite the emergency relief in various counties of the province. Saving disaster victims is like putting out a fire. Issuing bonds one day earlier means saving disaster victims one day earlier. Respectfully pray, awaiting your favorable reply. Sincerely, Xu Shiying and Wang Zhen.</p>
<h3>Henan Government Officials Appeal for Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>The Henan government officials telegraphed the central government, saying: The Central Party Headquarters Executive and Supervisory Committees, National Government Chairman Jiang, Presidents of various Yuan, Ministers of various Ministries, Chairman Xu of the Disaster Relief Committee: Henan Province has suffered from frequent disasters and war for years. Deaths, displacements, and devastation are everywhere. The various miseries have been reported to the Disaster Relief Committee by telegram many times. However, now in Shaanxi, Luoyang, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng and other places, disaster victims are gathering, filling streets and alleys. On the Longhai Road, they are coming east in an endless stream, numbering thousands every day. There are no funds for relief, and there is no way to accommodate them. In dozens of counties such as Linbao, Jiaxian, Lu Yi, Lu Lingzhen, and Zhechuan, bandits are everywhere, and every step is fraught with thorns. Staying means waiting for death, and fleeing is impossible. For example, Shilingzhen in Yiyang was originally a bustling market town with more than 2,000 houses, but after being burned and plundered by bandits, only broken temples and several oak trees remain. Within a radius of fifty miles, everyone has fled. Now that the spring plowing season has arrived, not only are there no farming tools or seeds left, but even the shelters have long been turned to ashes. Moreover, this situation is not limited to Shilingzhen. Zhenping County suffered a devastating bandit robbery and was razed to the ground. Linruzhen was the site of a fierce battle between two armies and was completely reduced to scorched earth. Other disaster situations are equally tragic and cannot be enumerated. It is found that Henan Province was ravaged by war twice last year. South of the Yellow River, north of Wan and Shen, more than forty counties were all reduced to war zones. It is estimated that less than 20% of the winter wheat was sown. If the autumn planting season is missed again, there will be no hope for wheat seeds in the future. Disasters follow one another, and the end is feared. Zhen Zuan and others are ashamed to guard this land and have no way to save it. Witnessing the tragic situation, they cannot remain silent. It is earnestly requested that strict orders be given to the military sub-districts to suppress bandits in order to stabilize the people's homes. Quickly allocate huge sums of money to comfort the orphans and widows in order to save the people's lives. So that tens of millions of disaster victims may have hope of recovery. The telegram is urgent. We are extremely apprehensive. Wu Zhenzuan, President of the Henan Higher Court; Li Shuchun, Director of the Civil Affairs Department; Wang Xiangrong, Director of the Finance Department; Zhang Honglie, Director of the Education Department; and Zhang Fang, Director of the Construction Department, bow in unison.</p>
<h3>Construction Committee Discusses Methods for Dredging the Wusong River</h3>
<p>The Construction Committee believes that the Wusong River, which connects to the Yangtze River, is an important waterway in Jiangnan. The downstream is silted up, and merchants and farmers are suffering. Methods should be found to dredge it as soon as possible. A meeting will be held at the committee at 2 p.m. on the 25th of this month to discuss dredging methods. Letters have also been sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Shanghai Special Municipality Government, and the Shanghai Commerce Reorganization Committee, inviting them to send representatives to attend the meeting at that time. It is heard that the Municipal Government will send representatives from the Port Authority.</p>
<h3>Inland Waterway Merchants Again Request Exemption from River Management Fees</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Province Collecting Inland River Management Fees: Last year, the waterway merchants from Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Tongzhou, and Zhenjiang requested exemption, but to no avail. Now that the provincial government has been reorganized, the Zhenjiang Navigation Association plans to take the opportunity to request exemption. A letter has been sent to the Shanghai Navigation Association for leadership. The Shanghai Association sent letters to various local navigation associations yesterday, saying: Greetings. We have recently received a letter from the Zhenjiang Navigation Association, stating that the appeal for river management fees has been going on for half a year, but the Construction Department has stubbornly adhered to its own views and refused to abolish it. The Executive Yuan has not yet issued any instructions. Now that the provincial government has been reorganized and the atmosphere is new, we plan to take this opportunity to petition again. If you agree, our association will follow suit. We have received a letter from the association. It is understood that this letter is printed in ink and is a circular letter. It is believed that various associations and colleagues in various ports must have received similar letters from the Zhenjiang Association. It has already been invited to a large consultation. Our association believes that the case of petitioning for the abolition of river management fees has been carried out many times without achieving its purpose. Now that the provincial government has been reorganized, and the chairman of the provincial government and the director of the Construction Department have been replaced, it is indeed necessary to petition again at this time. Our association strongly agrees, and we believe that your association will also express its sympathy. We originally planned to schedule another joint meeting to propose methods and elect representatives, but the purpose of the petition has always been to abolish it, so there is no need to vote again. The representatives from the previous time are familiar with the situation, and there is no need to re-elect them, so as to avoid the labor of traveling back and forth for colleagues in various ports. It is now proposed that the petition representatives continue to be the ones who were previously determined. The application should be headed by the Zhenjiang Navigation Association. If it is intended to prepare a seal, it may be stamped by the leader alone (because our association has a large number of official documents every day, and there are many pieces that require the use of the seal every day, it is impossible to carry the seal for use). It can be stated in the conclusion of the application that the association will be co-signed but not sealed. Moreover, this matter should not be delayed. It is proposed that the representatives gather at the Zhenjiang Navigation Association on the 24th of this month (Monday). After contacting each other, they will go to the provincial government and the Construction Department to petition together, in order to be accommodated to present the situation in person and achieve the purpose of abolition. In addition to sending separate letters of notification, a special letter is sent to you. Please consider and handle it accordingly. This is our hope.</p>
<h3>The Songhu Road Will Be Converted to New-Style Automatic Steam Cars</h3>
<p>To Be Implemented from April 1st</p>
<p>A Reception for All Sectors to Visit on the Same Day</p>
<p>The vehicles used on the Songhu Road have always been ordinary locomotives towing passenger cars, which is very expensive and uneconomical, and the business has not been promoted. Now, in order to improve the vehicles and promote the business, the Road Bureau has specially ordered five new-style automatic steam cars from England to Shanghai. Director Liu Weichi believes that road affairs urgently need to be improved, so he ordered that the Songhu Road be converted to use this new-style automatic steam car from the first day of the next month, and the existing vehicles will be moved to other sections. This automatic steam car is being used for the first time in Shanghai. Its structure is extremely refined, the seats are comfortable, and the speed has also increased, which is much more convenient for passengers.

<h3>Peddlers and Other Small Businessmen Send Representatives to Nanjing to Petition</h3>
<p>Two Representatives Set Off Last Night</p>
<p>More than 20 groups of peddlers and other small businessmen, after the Ministry of Industry and Commerce explained the Industry and Commerce Association Law, with the explicit statement that peddlers, brokers, and mobile merchants are not allowed to organize industry associations according to law, believe that this matter concerns their own interests. They have specially organized a joint office to appeal to the Party and government authorities to allow them to organize industry associations or to separately stipulate a special regulation, so that they can unite and resolve their suffering. After the fourth emergency meeting, it was resolved to send Zhou Keqin and Qin Xieyi as representatives of small merchants and groups in the city to Nanjing to petition the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. It is heard that the representatives set off on the night express last night (20th).</p>
<h3>The Japanese Customs Director Returns Home to Report</h3>
<p>Complete Investigation in Hankou</p>
<p>Departing for Japan Tomorrow</p>
<p>Mr. Kubodera Kin, the Director of the Nagasaki Customs in Japan, was dispatched to China the day before yesterday to investigate the tax collection system and equipment conditions of customs in various parts of China, because the new tariff is about to be implemented. After visiting the main officials of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance and the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, he left Nanjing and went to Hankou to investigate the recent situation of the customs on both sides of the Yangtze River. Yesterday, he finished his official business and returned to Shanghai from Hankou. He is scheduled to return to Japan tomorrow (22nd) on the Nagasaki Maru to report. According to Mr. Kubodera, he is very satisfied with the results of this investigation. Although there are also points that should be improved in the tax collection system and procedures of customs in various places, they have made a lot of progress compared to before. He has now drafted a report and will have a detailed and precise report.</p>
<h3>Disputes Over the Monetary System on the Chaoshan Railway</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce and Industry Telegraphs to Request a Cease</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Railways and the authorities of Guangdong and Shantou yesterday, saying: The Executive Yuan Ministry of Industry and Commerce Ministry of Railways, Nanjing; the Guangdong Provincial Government Construction Department, Shantou Municipal Government: Recently, we received reports from the Executive Committee of the affiliated association, Chen Zhiying, and the representatives of the Chaozhou, Haicheng, and Rao Guilds, Huang Shaoyan and Weng Ziguang, stating that the Chaoshan Railway had requested the Construction Department to add 20% to the passenger ticket fee in the 16th year of the Republic of China. After the opposition from all sectors of Chaoshan, the Ministry of Transportation telegraphed the provincial government, ordering it to be cancelled. Now, the Ministry of Railways has sent commissioners Cui Yulin and others to set up a committee to reorganize. Several months have passed, and the vehicles, machinery, tracks, and sleepers of the railway have become extremely rotten and dangerous, and no action has been taken. Taking advantage of the government's abolition of the 20% military fee surcharge, they colluded with Commissioner Cui Yulin and obtained the approval of the Ministry of Railways to change the passenger ticket and freight fees, which were previously collected in Haoyang, to be collected in this foreign currency. The estimated annual income of more than 200,000 yuan happens to match the abolished 20% military fee surcharge, which is no different from substituting one thing for another. Now, after opposition from all sectors of Chaoshan, it has not been resolved. However, the transportation of goods has stopped, and the business has suffered major losses. It is earnestly requested that you transfer the telegrams to the Yuan, Ministry, Provincial Department, and Hall, ordering them to cancel the abolition of the order to collect the railway and change it to collect the ocean, and to separately instruct the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Guangdong Construction Department to instruct the Railway Committee to comply. It is also hoped that the Mayor of Shantou will first stop the collection. The merchants and people will be fortunate, and the transportation will be fortunate. Chairman Lin Kanghou, Standing Committee Members Su Minsheng, Zhang Yuquan, Lu Guangji, Chen Riping, Li Kuian, Peng Chuli, etc. of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, bow in unison.</p>
<h3>Telegraphing to Request the Amendment of the Name of the Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce telegraphed the National Government yesterday, saying: National Government, Nanjing: Recently, we received a letter from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Pontianak, Dutch East Indies, stating that Article 41 of the Implementing Rules of the Chamber of Commerce Law stipulates that all overseas Chinese Chambers of Commerce established before the implementation of this law shall be renamed as the Chinese Merchant Chamber of a certain port in accordance with this law. The two characters of "Shang Hui" have repeated sounds, which is inconvenient to call out verbally. It is also not obvious when inscribed on plaques. It seems that it should be changed to the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. It has been telegraphed to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government on the 2nd of February to request amendment. We are correspondingly writing to make the same request. It is found that the two characters of "Shang Hui" in the Chinese Merchant Chamber of Commerce are repeated, which is inconvenient to call out, and it is also not obvious when printed and inscribed. It is indeed a real situation. However, Articles 6 and 41 of the Chamber of Commerce Law already have regulations on the Chinese Merchant Chamber of Commerce. Articles 41 and 42 of the Implementing Rules of the Chamber of Commerce Law are based on the Chamber of Commerce Law. It is reasonable to telegraph to the Yuan for review and approval. Please allow it to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation and to amend Articles 6 and 41 of the Chamber of Commerce Law to the Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce. After the report is submitted and promulgated, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will be ordered to amend and promulgate Articles 41 and 42 of the Implementing Rules of the Chamber of Commerce Law accordingly, which would be deeply fortunate.</p>

<h3>Young Woman Sues Again for Divorce from Elderly Husband</h3>
<p>Married at 22, Husband Nearly 70</p>
<p>Mother Decided and Was Deceived by Matchmaker</p>
<p>Judge's Mediation Fails, Judgment Scheduled</p>
<p>Recognized Husband as Great-Grandfather at Wedding</p>
<p>Li Chen, a young woman from Dinghai, Zhejiang (also known as Chen Xiuying), is now 29 years old. At the age of 22, her mother arranged for her to marry Li Yongxing, a white-bearded old man of 74, as his second wife. At the time of the marriage, Li was already 67. The woman's family was deceived by the matchmaker, who falsely claimed that Li was only at the age to know his destiny (50 years old). When she first arrived at Li's house, before the wedding, she saw a white-bearded, white-haired old man, dressed impeccably. She mistakenly thought he was the great-grandfather. Only after marrying the old man did she realize he was her husband. However, what's done cannot be undone, and she could only blame herself.</p>
<p>First Divorce Suit Led to Reconciliation</p>
<p>Recently, she has been subjected to all sorts of abuse by her husband and daughter-in-law, Wang. Feeling that she could no longer endure it, she filed a lawsuit for separation with the local court in February of this year. After a court hearing, a reconciliation was reached in court. The plaintiff and defendant continued to live together. In addition to food and lodging, the defendant provided the plaintiff with 15 yuan per month for clothing and spending money. The reconciliation was established on February 8.</p>
<p>Seeks Assistance from Women's Association for Second Lawsuit</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Li Chen hired lawyer Zhu Fang to petition the local court for a divorce. Her reasons were unbearable abuse and failure to comply with the court's reconciliation record. The defendant, Li Yongxing, also hired lawyer Dai Jinghuai to present a defense, requesting cohabitation and refuting the plaintiff's claims. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Judge Ge Zhitan specially opened the second court for a hearing. Both parties, accompanied by their lawyers, were present in court. According to the plaintiff, Li Chen, she is 29 years old, from Dinghai, and currently resides at the Women's Association. The defendant, Li Yongxing, is her husband. The judge asked why she was filing a lawsuit again. She replied that she was requesting a divorce.</p>
<p>Seven Years of Marriage, Unbearable Suffering</p>
<p>The judge asked how long she had been married. She replied it had been seven years. The judge asked if she had given birth to any children. She replied that she had not. He (referring to the defendant) said she couldn't bear children, so he often beat her. For example, after leaving the court last time, upon returning home, she was beaten by the defendant as soon as she reached the gate. After someone intervened, she was taken inside, but was beaten again. Because she couldn't bear the suffering, she had to kneel on the ground and beg. Only then did the defendant let go of her, and also took the 7.4 yuan she had on her. She remembers him slapping her and not giving her food. If she lived elsewhere, he would definitely say bad things about her, so she sought help from the Women's Association. Moreover, she was deceived by the matchmaker at the time, who said he was only in his fifties. Because her father had passed away, and she only had her mother, with no older siblings and no younger siblings, her mother thought that although the defendant was older, no accidents would occur in practice, so her mother also planned to rely on the defendant to live and be supported for the rest of her life. At the time, the betrothal gift was 416 yuan. The judge asked who else was in the defendant's family. She replied that he had a daughter-in-law, Wang, who was 32 years old. It is said that his first wife and son were forced to death by him. Now he has two granddaughters and two grandsons who are adopted. The judge asked how much property he had. She replied 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, and more than 20 houses, receiving over 200 yuan in rent each month. He also had property in his hometown.</p>
<p>Old Husband Claims Wife is Immoral in Defense</p>
<p>The defendant, Li Yongxing, stated that he is 74 years old, from Dinghai, and lives at No. 1 Yongxing Lane, Hongzhen, which is his own property. He married her when she was 22 years old, and he does not beat her. She has immoral behavior with her younger sister's husband. She is good, but her mother is very bad. The judge asked if he gave her food. He replied, "How could I not give her food?" The judge asked what he thought about her wanting a divorce. He replied that he did not want it. Since marrying her, she has run away with various losses amounting to no less than 5,000 yuan. At this point, the judge ordered the defendant to leave the courtroom.</p>
<p>Judge Tries to Persuade Woman Not to Divorce</p>
<p>The judge then said to the plaintiff, "He is over seventy and has property, all of which will be yours in the future. Why not stay? I advise you not to divorce." She replied, "I must divorce. I really can't stand the suffering from him and his daughter-in-law."</p>
<p>Judge Advises Husband to Agree to Divorce</p>
<p>The judge then called the defendant back to the stand and said to him, "You are old and already have grandsons and granddaughters. Now, why not grant her wish and divorce? If you must marry again, you can choose a good one to marry." He replied, "I really cannot divorce her. My daughter-in-law is very dull and doesn't know numbers, so she manages the household affairs on weekdays."</p>
<p>Pay 20 Yuan to Calm Down</p>
<p>The judge said, "How about ordering him to pay you some money?" She replied, "I need at least 3,000 yuan." The judge said, "I will order him to pay you 20 yuan to calm down. Besides, you are old and not without money. Even if it was more, she couldn't take it out. You should let it go. Besides, the four words: wine, lust, wealth, and anger, you must eventually take lightly. If you insist on a certain amount, that is being stubborn." He replied, "She has a lover who can take it out."</p>
<p>Failure to Reconcile, Awaiting Judgment</p>
<p>Since reconciliation was not possible, the judge invited Prosecutor Li to the court to express his opinion. The plaintiff's lawyer also stated the case and claimed that the defendant had insulted the plaintiff in court, which constituted grounds for divorce. The defendant's lawyer also rose to argue. After a long time, the judge announced the end of the debate and said that judgment would be announced at 1:00 PM on the 24th. Then, the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>Watson's Manager Guo Weiyi's Extortion Case Solved</h3>
<p>Threatening Letters Extort 5,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Contact Should be a Woman</p>
<p>Holding an Umbrella as a Sign</p>
<p>Arrested After Two Attempts</p>
<p>Guo Weiyi, the Cantonese manager of Watson's Soda Factory on Jiangxi Road, has recently received threatening letters demanding 5,000 yuan. The last letter specified that the contact should be made on the 19th between 8 and 9 PM at the Dixiwei Road Bridge. The person going should be a woman, holding an umbrella as a sign. If the appointment was missed, certain measures would be taken. Guo sent the letters to the General Patrol Room for investigation. The head of the patrol assigned detectives Wang Cheng, Ying Ruiqing, and Zhao Zifang to go to the meeting place several times, but without success. Until the night before last, they went to the agreed place to lie in ambush and ordered female inspector Song Liu to stand by the bridge holding an umbrella. When the time came, a Cantonese man, Situ Shaowu (also known as Situ Hua), arrived, first scrutinized the inspector, and then approached her to speak. The detectives, who were lying in ambush nearby, immediately apprehended him and went to Situ Hua's home at No. 3620 Wulin Lane, Dongyouheng Road, where they found two sharp knives and letters. Yesterday, he was brought before Judge Zhou at the Provisional Court. According to Detective Wang, on the 4th of this month, Guo received the first letter, asking to meet near the Dongyang Garden on Dixiwei Road on the 6th. Guo reported it to the police, and they waited for a long time but did not see anyone. On the 10th, a second letter was received, asking to meet on Dongyouheng Road the next night. The person going had to be a woman, so female inspector Gao Wang was ordered to go at the appointed time. The defendant was seen wearing an overcoat and glasses, pacing the area, but there was no conversation, so it was inconvenient to arrest him. On the 14th, Guo received another letter, asking to meet behind the gate of the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital on Yalu Road. Because workers were watching nearby, the attempt failed again. Guo received another letter the next day, with harsh words. The defendant was arrested last night. He requested a postponement of the hearing. When questioned, Situ Hua claimed to work at Watson's Huishan Branch and denied sending threatening letters. Judge Zhou ordered him to write numbers, then ordered him to be taken into custody and adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3>Japanese Nurse Kyogaro Sakai of Shibata Hospital Drowns Himself in Sichuan Road</h3>
<p>Body Found Yesterday at Paotai Bay</p>
<p>Kyogaro Sakai, a Japanese nurse at the Shibata Eye Clinic at No. 1 Helin Lane, North Sichuan Road, suddenly went to the seaside of Wusong Paotai Bay the day before yesterday and drowned himself. His body was recovered from the seaside yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mental Disorder</p>
<p>Kyogaro Sakai, a 19-year-old Japanese, had been studying ophthalmology and working as a nurse at the Shibata Hospital for years. He was known to be a good friend to everyone in the hospital. Last winter, a young woman came to the hospital for eye treatment. Kyogaro fell in love with her at first sight, but the woman was completely unaware of it, leading Kyogaro to become mentally disturbed due to unrequited love, eventually developing mental illness. Initially, no one knew about it. It was only recently discovered by others.</p>
<p>Suicide by Drowning</p>
<p>At about 10 AM the day before yesterday, Kyogaro somehow had a dispute with a sick woman, and his attitude was different from usual. After 4 PM, he returned to his dormitory and wrote at his desk for two hours. Kyogaro then suddenly left the hospital. Initially, no one noticed. It was not until that evening that his colleagues found a suicide note in his dormitory. The note stated that he had gone to Wusong Paotai Bay to drown himself. Everyone in the hospital was shocked, but because it was late, there was no way to search for him. The hospital reported it to the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai for handling.</p>
<p>Body Recovered</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the Japanese Consulate General specially dispatched Patrol Chief Ti Shiro of the Foreign Affairs Department, accompanied by interpreters, in a car at 8 AM yesterday to search for Kyogaro's whereabouts along the seaside near Wusong Paotai Bay, but without any results. At about 1 PM, Ti Shiro informed the local Baojia and hired more than ten villagers to search the water along the coast, hoping to find the body. He explained that if the body was found, 40 yuan would be paid, and if the body was not found, 10 yuan would still be given. The villagers were very enthusiastic and divided up to search the sea. After an hour, a body was finally recovered from the wooden stakes on the seawall in front of the Lion Bridge of the North Fort of the Wusong Fortress. Ti Shiro confirmed that it was indeed the body of Kyogaro Sakai. However, a knife wound of about two inches long was found on the neck of the body.</p>
<p>Collecting the Body Today</p>
<p>After the body was discovered, because the scene of the incident was within the jurisdiction of the fortress and the Seventh District of the Public Security Bureau, Fortress Commander Deng Zhenquan immediately dispatched Adjutant Shen Zitian to investigate. Shortly after, Chen Youhua, the head of the Seventh District, also sent District Officer Li to the scene to inspect. Ti Shiro certified that the deceased had committed suicide due to mental illness and that there were no other circumstances, and submitted a statement to the two agencies requesting exemption from an autopsy. District Officer Li of the Seventh District reported back to the station because there were scars on the body. After Chen District Chief requested instructions from the Public Security Bureau by telephone, the Bureau replied approving the certification of the Japanese Consulate Patrol Chief Ti Shiro and sent someone to guard the body, returning to Shanghai at about 5 PM, and planned to lead the family of the deceased to Song today to collect the body for burial.</p>
<h3>Meningitis Found in Tangwan Township</h3>
<p>County Government Has Taken Measures to Prevent It</p>
<p>Meningitis has recently been discovered in Tangwan Township, which belongs to Shanghai County. It is reported that several people have died from this disease. The county government heard the report yesterday and, given that it is the time of winter and spring transition, which is prone to transmission, specially instructed the Shanghai Hospital to send specialists to the countryside to take preventive measures. On the one hand, the Public Security Bureau was ordered to conduct a detailed investigation, and any cases of the disease must be reported in the shortest possible time to prevent its spread.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Measures for Disposing of Garbage</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Gazette states that measures for disposing of garbage within the boundary have been considered by the Council several times. Now, the Director of Public Works has drafted measures and submitted them, and they have been approved by the Council for implementation. It is now planned to purchase one Balmer incinerator and one Interno smelting furnace. Each of these two furnaces can incinerate 200 tons of garbage every 24 hours. The cost of purchasing the furnaces and constructing the site is estimated at 80,000 pounds, and the Binlang Road warehouse has been designated as the location for the equipment.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Urges Completion of New Equipment at Inland Waterworks</h3>
<p>Contracting Firms Promise Completion Date</p>
<p>Bureau of Public Utilities Orders Submission of Written Guarantee</p>
<p>The quality of water at the Inland Water Company is poor, and the population of Nanshi has increased, so the water supply is also insufficient. The Bureau of Public Utilities previously urged the construction of new water pools, the cleaning of old water pools, and measures to expand the water supply. The company complied with the plan and adopted the plan of the Malcolm Engineering Office, adding rapid filtration, concrete sedimentation, and clear water pools, and purchasing several electric pumps. Recently, the Bureau noted that the company's purchase of pumps had been overdue for more than a year, and the construction of the filtration pools had been underway for almost half a year. With the summer approaching, demand would inevitably increase, and the new equipment needed to be completed quickly. The company was ordered to discuss and reply with a completion date as soon as possible. On March 9, the company invited the responsible persons of the Jiu Ji Construction Factory and the Malcolm Foreign Firm to discuss ways to expedite completion. All agreed that while full completion would still take time, the filtration pool project would be rushed day and night, and it was estimated that it could be completed and used by May of this year. Even if the summer demand increased, there would be no shortage, and each provided a letter as proof that the mechanical equipment could be completed at the same time as the filtration pool. After receiving the report, the Bureau ordered the company to separately instruct the firms to provide a written guarantee and formally report it to show seriousness.</p>
<h3>Fangbang and Jishui Road Rent Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>Both Parties Submit Guarantees to Close the Case</p>
<p>The case of a rental dispute between fruit stores such as Fucheng, Xiemao, Yonghefeng, and Jufeng and the landlord, surnamed Ye, due to the reconstruction of Fangbang and Jishui Roads in the Sixteen Puh area into Dongmen Road, was previously ordered by the Shanghai Municipal Government to be mediated jointly by the Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus. On March 18, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting. The representative of the Public Security Bureau reported that, according to the report from the First District, the landlord and tenant representatives had been summoned and a settlement had been reached. The landlord would pay each of Xiemao, Yonghefeng, and Jufeng 500 taels to relocate elsewhere, and each had submitted a guarantee to settle the case. However, Zao Cheng, one household, had not been resolved and still requested to rent five buildings. The chairman advised both parties to make concessions and decided on three buildings. Later, after further consultation and out of friendship, Fucheng voluntarily gave up one building, and the landlord was willing to compensate Fucheng 500 taels for relocation losses. Each submitted a guarantee, and the case was resolved.</p>
<h3>Wusong Electricity Dispute Resolved Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Wusong electricity dispute has been ongoing for a long time. Because the users did not achieve their goal of reducing fees, they refused to pay, which has lasted for two months. The Eighth District Party Department, fearing that the long-term suspension would cause losses to both parties, summoned Zhu Shangyi and Bao Siren, the managers of Baoming Electricity Company, and Cao Dichen, the chairman of the Electricity Users Association, to the department yesterday, presided over by Yin Gongtian and Shen Risheng, members of the Eighth District Party Committee, to discuss mediation methods. As a result, the company agreed to reduce the electricity fee by two cents per kilowatt-hour from March 1, calculated at 21 cents. The users understood the company's difficulties in developing its business and that electricity fees were difficult to calculate uniformly with the Shanghai Municipal Government's range. Now that the company had agreed to reduce it by two cents, they considered it satisfactory and formally resolved it yesterday. The company has submitted the details to the Bureau of Public Utilities for record.</p>
<h3>Shanghai South Bus Can Still Run Longhua Special Cars</h3>
<p>Airplane Will Distribute Notices Tomorrow</p>
<p>Lin Zengding, the battalion commander of the 3rd Battalion, 26th Regiment, 5th Division, currently stationed at Longhua Temple, fears that reactionary elements will take advantage of the incense season to blend into the temple as tourists increase, which would be detrimental to public safety. He specially added guard posts at the front door to show seriousness. The merchants and residents of the Longhua area have repeatedly appealed to Battalion Commander Lin to maintain their livelihoods, as the plan for the year lies in the spring. Battalion Commander Lin, who has been stationed in Longhua for years, usually combines kindness and authority. The merchants and residents have considerable faith. After this request, it is said that he has obtained permission from Battalion Commander Lin, and all legitimate tourists and pilgrims are still allowed to enter the temple for worship. The Shanghai South Bus Company, upon receiving this news, has made preparations to open special buses as scheduled. On March 22, it entrusted the airport to use an airplane to distribute notices to attract passengers.</p>
<h3>Died from Overeating</h3>
<p>Shen A Lin, a Native of Huzhou Who Came to Shanghai to Seek Work</p>
<p>Shen A Lin, a native of Huzhou, was unemployed at home. A few days ago, he was invited to Shanghai by his friend Zheng Linqing, intending to find a job. That evening, they arrived in Shanghai and went to a restaurant for a hearty meal. Seeing the rich dishes, Shen ate a large amount. After eating, he suddenly felt abdominal pain, which gradually worsened. Zheng sent him to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but he died the day before yesterday. The Xin Zha Police Station received a report and ordered detectives to transport the body to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road. Yesterday, Temporary Judge Luo arrived at the office to clarify that he had died of illness. Since there were no family members, he ordered Pushan Mountain Villa to claim the body for burial.</p>
<h3>Catching Adultery, Falling from Building, Broken Finger, Injured Body</h3>
<p>Wang Kuiwu, a native of Jintan, is currently 37 years old. He married Ms. Wu as his wife through a matchmaker in his hometown (Wang is the same age). Wang was originally a bamboo weaver, but because the income was very small, he brought his wife to Shanghai and lived together in a pavilion-style building at No. 71 Dunhou Lane, Xinmin Road, Zhabei. Ms. Wu worked in a silk factory, and Wang pulled a rickshaw for a living. Because he worked the night shift, he had to go out to pull the rickshaw every night. Ms. Wu, a middle-aged woman, was not used to sleeping alone and secretly became acquainted with a male worker from the same factory, a Ningbo native named A Tu. A Tu was only 21 years old, and the two were very fond of each other. Every time Wang went out on the night shift, A Tu would sneak in and sleep with Ms. Wu. This became a habit. After a long time, Wang found out. On the night before last, at 2 AM, he pretended to go out to pull the rickshaw and hid near the alley entrance. After a while, he saw A Tu entering the house to have a secret meeting with Ms. Wu. Wang's anger flared up, so he sneaked into the house and rushed into the pavilion-style building, seeing A Tu taking off his coat, preparing to sleep with Ms. Wu. Seeing Kuiwu entering the door, he knew things were bad and pushed Kuiwu out with force, closing the door. Kuiwu lost his footing and grabbed the door frame, causing three of his ring fingers to be crushed off. He fell from the stairs, blood flowing all over the ground, and became unconscious, lying on the ground. Later, the second landlord called the police and took the adulterer and adulteress to the First Precinct of the Fourth District. Because the case was criminal, they transferred the documents to the Local Court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Public Concession One-Way Traffic Measures</h3>
<p>Effective April 1</p>
<p>Trial Run on Hankou Road</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Vehicle Affairs Committee decided that one-way traffic should be adopted on congested streets in the concession to reduce difficulties. The Police Department has now re-examined and reported these measures, which are recorded below. The points to note for one-way traffic are: 1. There must be parallel roads in close proximity to allow vehicles to travel in the opposite direction, so as to avoid delays and facilitate avoidance. 2. At the point where one-way traffic ends and two-way traffic begins, there must be wide facilities to allow vehicles to turn easily and avoid traffic congestion. The two points on the right should be considered, but most of the car drivers in the concession do not know how to read. It is not certain whether they can understand the announcements. Otherwise, it will be necessary to add more police officers to use for command. Among the current police, this type of talent is difficult to select, because all police officers are used to prevent crime, and it will be necessary to hire traffic police separately. However, from the point of view of senior officials in the Police Department, the number of patrols for traffic management has already exceeded the quota. The legislation on one-way traffic on Sichuan Road and Jiangxi Road must be considered according to the following two points: 1. All vehicles on these two roads are two-way traffic, and they carry many passengers. 2. At the end of Jiangxi Road, all vehicles must turn and cross the Suzhou River via Sichuan Road Bridge or Zhabu Road Bridge.

At the same time, I have two points. The Party divides the revolution into three stages: military government, tutelage, and constitutional government. The first stage has already passed in Jiangsu, and the second stage is now underway. We know that the purpose of tutelage is to train the people so that they can directly exercise the four powers and prepare to transfer the entire political power to the people to form a truly democratic country. The local autonomy personnel during the tutelage period represent the government in doing this basic work to promote its realization, which is different from the autonomy personnel during the constitutional government period, who represent the people and supervise the government. You must understand this clearly, take on the mission of the times, and follow the government's plan one by one. This is the first point. Furthermore, the Party has an important slogan, which is that we go to the people. I deeply believe that this slogan is trans-temporal and trans-spatial. To put it clearly, this slogan has its value and significance at any time and in any place. You township chiefs are close to the people and deep in the grassroots. In terms of responsibility, you are the direct public servants of the people. From now on, all wills should be the will of the majority of the people, and all actions should be the actions of the majority of the people. Conversely, it is necessary to sacrifice personal wills and actions and follow the lead of the people. I hope you will strive to promote the construction of a new Shanghai in the First District. This is the second point. Furthermore, the training institute is to train qualified autonomy personnel and further study autonomy knowledge. Of course, I hope you will explore carefully," and so on. Later, Zhu Jiasheng, Jin Zuobin, Zhang Boliang, and others also gave very practical speeches (not recorded due to length). A photo was taken and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Sea Guest</p>
<p>Woman: You still don't know how high my passion for you is.</p>
<p>Man: Of course I know. But as soon as I get close to you, my money immediately melts away.</p>
<p>Man: I remember seeing you on the tram the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Woman: So you're the ticket seller on the tram?</p>
<p>Photographer: Madam. Please put your hand on your husband's shoulder. That will feel natural.</p>
<p>Man: It would feel more natural if she put her hand in my pocket.</p>
<p>A: I've been serving my boss for twenty years. B: That's not surprising. I've been serving my wife for twenty-five years. Tomorrow is my silver wedding anniversary.</p>
<p>Teacher: Child. You mustn't sign your name so carelessly.</p>

<h3>Yu He Zeng's Honor in Cuba</h3>
<p>— Li Chen</p>
<p>There are more than 30,000 overseas Chinese in Havana, Cuba. They have considerable influence in business. They actively promote the arts and culture of their motherland. They spare no effort to recruit anyone who can enhance the prestige of our country. For example, the illusionist Yu He Zeng's visit to perform there is one such example.</p>
<p>The Havana Paris Theater is one of the most famous theaters. A certain overseas Chinese, seeing that the illusionary arts there were unworthy of mention, introduced Yu He Zeng to perform, to show that the illusionary arts of the Chinese people are far superior to those of the Cuban people. In the days before Yu's performance, he worked hard to promote it. As expected, he showed his skills on stage and the Cuban people were captivated by him. On February 2nd, an American businessman, impressed by his reputation, said to the public that Yu's skills were indeed superior, but he had not seen any amazing skills. Now he would like to bet with Yu. There is a wooden box. Please have Yu lie in it and nail it tightly. If Yu can jump out of the box by himself, he is willing to pay him a thousand gold pieces as a reward. Otherwise, Yu's skills are only small tricks. At that time, some overseas Chinese were worried for Yu. Yu said generously, "These are minor skills. What's worth mentioning?" The businessman acted according to the agreement. After nailing it tightly, the businessman reported the agreement to the audience and shouted to Yu to come out quickly, intending to embarrass Yu. Who knew that Yu had already stood high on the wooden box before he finished shouting? Therefore, the audience was amazed, and the businessman also presented Yu with a check for a thousand gold pieces and expressed his admiration.</p>
<p>Yu's various skills are indeed touching. However, one thing that cannot be left unsaid is that when Yu performs, he always likes to wear an old-fashioned Chinese python robe, which makes foreigners suspect that China still uses this clothing as a modern dress. I hope Yu can correct this.</p>
<h3>Record of Mistaken Love</h3>
<p>— Jie Fei</p>
<p>The other night, Mr. C got up to have a heart-to-heart talk, recounting his experience of being mistaken for someone else's love. The details were quite bizarre, so I recorded them.</p>
<p>In the autumn when Mr. C entered Zhongda University, two weeks later, he received a passionate love letter from a Mr. KYM, signed from Kaifeng. He mistook Mr. C for a delicate young woman. The language was full of tenderness and the affection was especially lingering, as if he could not bear to miss and be fascinated by her. Mr. C felt pity and resentment at the same time. However, in the end, because the amount of hatred was not as heavy as the amount of pity, he still responded with a letter, mostly sarcastic, and did not add the words "little sister" above the question mark. But Mr. K did not understand at all. Instead, he sent letters frequently. Mr. C also responded frequently, only strictly rebuking his errors. Letters also came, sometimes with postage stamps attached, ranging from one yuan to several yuan, asking Mr. C to buy and send new books. Mr. C also listened to his requests. Although he wanted to cut off contact, he could not because the postage stamps kept coming. It has been a year now. He has sent fifteen or sixteen express registered letters and thirty ordinary letters. Recently, he even sent a photo, hoping to receive a beautiful reply.</p>
<p>Mr. K is currently working at the Xiawa Town Post Office. He often cannot express his meaning well, but his calligraphy is quite good, and his deep affection is especially touching.</p>
<p>I think Mr. K must have a real woman he loves in his heart. His first letter to Mr. C had the words "test together, get accepted together." He also told him that he was in financial difficulties and could not come to school. Mr. C made a big mistake with a small act of kindness. To be loved by someone is also a unique aspect of love.</p>
<p>Attached: "Regarding Mr. K's name, it is not clearly written. It is according to Mr. C's intention."</p>
<h3>A Woman Who Bathes in Milk</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>At the intersection of Gansu and Qinghai provinces, there is a place called Xining. There are many natives called Salatu. The men of this tribe are extremely ugly, while the women are very beautiful. Most of the uncivilized aborigines have grotesque shapes and are unbearable to look at. But this is not the case here. Their women are not only beautiful and lovely, but their muscles are also more delicate and clean than ordinary people. The reason is that these women often bathe their bodies in milk, which naturally makes them glow and be as white as jade.</p>
<p>To get this kind of woman, you don't have to adopt courtship, marriage proposals, or other procedures. You only need to buy several horses. However, the horses must be chosen to be fast, otherwise it will be difficult to be selected and you will be rejected. I heard a friend talk about his friend Mr. Zhang who had been to Xining and described it like this.</p>
<h3>Mei Lanfang's Grand Arrival in New York</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>The New York Times reported on February 9:</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilson is the leader of the support group.</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang, China's most outstanding famous actor, arrived at Central Station yesterday afternoon from Seattle. In addition to the twenty-two actors, there were several consultants and secretaries. He is scheduled to perform at the 49th Street Theater on February 17 (for two weeks). According to his translator, Mr. Mei can perform hundreds of plays. The plays he is performing in New York this time are all his masterpieces.</p>
<p>The people who came to greet him at the station yesterday were led by Xiong Chongzhi, the Chinese Consul General. Among the group representatives were the Chinese United Dunyi Association, the Moy (Mei) Clan Association, the Lenny (Liang) Clan Association, and the China-America Association.</p>
<p>Mr. Mei is thirty-six years old, of medium height, wearing Western-style underwear, a Chinese gown and mandarin jacket, and a woolen hat. He carried a cane and his attitude was extremely gentle and refined. He was especially polite and courteous when meeting and greeting people. When he got out of the car, a group of young Chinese students, each holding the national flags of China and the United States, sang a welcome song specially made for Mr. Mei and presented him with two bouquets of flowers. Mr. Mei shook hands with each of the Chinese children and thanked them with a smile.</p>
<p>Mr. Mei is staying at the Balasa Hotel. Before he had unpacked his luggage, he was surrounded by reporters and photographers for several hours. It is said that Mr. Mei is best at playing female roles and earns a lot of money every year. He has been learning opera since he was seven years old. His ancestors for three generations were all famous actors.</p>
<p>As soon as Mr. Mei arrived in New York, invitations for welcome receptions came one after another. Last night, Zhang Jia'ao, President of the Bank of China, hosted a banquet for Mr. Mei at the Ambassador Hotel. This afternoon, there were receptions at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Old Bolt at 825 Fifth Avenue and the home of Mrs. Klein at 820 Fifth Avenue. Fontaine, Ge Lien, and many other famous actors will attend the pre-meeting at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Old Bolt. Mr. Mei will go to Washington on Friday as a special guest of the Chinese Minister.</p>
<p>Mr. Mei's translator said that Mr. Mei only performs three nights a week in his country. The Chinese theater time is from 6:00 PM to 1:00 AM, and Mr. Mei's performance is about one hour. He usually goes on stage around 11:00 PM. His most famous play is Farewell My Concubine. He also brought Mr. Qi, the chief editor of the play, to the United States.</p>
<p>Before each performance by Mr. Mei in the United States, someone will give a lecture on the content of the play to make it easier to understand. The committee responsible for supporting Mr. Mei's tour of the United States is led by Mrs. Wilson and Mrs. Wu Bo Shu, and includes former Minister to China Klein, China-America Association President Dr. Monroe, Dr. Dewey, Mr. and Mrs. Kang, and Mr. Pike of the Yale Drama School.</p>
<p>When asked about his impressions of coming to the United States, Mr. Mei said that he had long had this ambition and was only now able to achieve his goal. He was very happy to see the prosperity and progress of all industries in this country, which was full of vitality. Mr. Mei will also investigate the art of American theater.</p>
<h3>Common Sense of Eating</h3>
<p>— Jun Mei</p>
<p>Melons that float in water should not be eaten.</p>
<p>A turtle that cannot stretch its feet, has sunken eyes, no skirt, and has the characters "king," "five," or "divination" on its abdomen will surely die if eaten.</p>
<p>The hearts and lungs of pigs and sheep with small holes are very toxic.</p>
<p>The blue-black contents of birds are harmful to eat.</p>
<p>Do not add Nepeta to bass when cooking, otherwise eating it will cause illness.</p>
<p>Liquor stored in tin containers will be poisonous if eaten overnight.</p>
<p>Drinking liquor with raw ginger is harmful to health. Wrasse without gills or green in color must not be eaten.</p>
<p>A male chicken that is three or four years old is very poisonous to eat.</p>
<p>Rabbits that die with their eyes closed should not be eaten.</p>
<p>Crabs should not be eaten with persimmons, as eating them will cause disease.</p>
<p>Eating too much pig suet is harmful.</p>
<p>Eggs without yolks can cause malaria if eaten.</p>
<h3>New Sounds on the Lake</h3>
<p>— Master Yi Hong Guan</p>
<p>"The land has beautiful lakes and mountains, the first state in the southeast." This is what the ancients used to praise Hangzhou. It embraces rivers and the sea, and has lakes and mountains. The beauty of the scenery and the magnificence of the atmosphere are not only the best in the southeast, but also the best in the world. Switzerland in Europe may be comparable, but half of it is man-made. Speaking of nature, it is far inferior to us. Therefore, tourists flock to the road, and even foreigners from overseas are lingering and admiring. There are those who look at the map and admire it. Since the founding of the Wu Yue Kingdom and the establishment of the Southern Song Dynasty, for thousands of years, its prosperity has become more and more obvious. It is no wonder that Marco Polo's travels in the Yuan Dynasty regarded it as the most prosperous place in the world.</p>
<p>Hangzhou's scenic spots are famous for the West Lake. In recent years, with the development of materials, there have been many beautiful buildings on the lake. The main hall of the Exposition is the most prominent. At the beginning of the year, the government allocated the hall to Hangzhou Electric Power to be used as a movie theater for users' entertainment. All users of the factory have the right to receive free movie tickets. This is to imply the meaning of sharing happiness with the people. The equipment in the theater is striving for excellence. Most of the films that have been shown over the years are the latest productions from Europe and the United States. Every time the film is changed, everyone flocks to see it. What is most surprising is that although there are many soldiers in Hangzhou, they never dare to rely on their power to force their way in, or make trouble unreasonably, causing disturbances to the audience's enjoyment. However, the one who maintains order is the young usher who is not yet dry behind the ears. It is said that the person in charge of the theater is Chen Shouyin, the business section chief of the electric power plant. Chen has a wealth of experience in film, so his measures are well-planned.</p>
<p>Theater News: It is said that Tongde Hospital has been planning to rebuild a new building for a long time. Recently, it was decided to locate it on Hart Road. The new equipment in the hospital requires a lot of money. Therefore, it is planned to perform a play for one day to provide financial assistance. Pang Jingzhou, the president of the hospital, went to Suzhou yesterday to discuss the forensic class and returned to Shanghai. That evening, he invited famous actors from the north and south to discuss the program. It is said that Xun Huisheng and Zhou Xinfang's Haircut Instead of Head, Gao Qingkui, Guan Dayuan, and Jin Shaoshan's Battle of Changsha, Xu Biyun's Eight Great Hammers, Li Guichun, Bai Yukun, Zhao Junyu, Lin Shusen, Wang Huchen, etc.'s Double Yellow Crane Tower, Xiao Yang Yuelou, Liu Xiaoheng, Zhao Ruquan, Wang Yunfang, etc.'s Eight Lang Visits His Mother, and Rong Lijuan, Bai Mudan, Zhou Fengqin, and Li Huijin's Four Golden Lotus, Liu Hanchen, Wang Yingwu, and Li Xiangyun's Great Sizhou City, etc. will be performed at the Shanghai Stage at noon on Friday (the 21st of this month).</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (153)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 9: The Gentlemen Laugh and Play Hide-and-Seek; A Charming Woman Protects with Affection</p>
<p>The Mingjing Club is directly opposite the racecourse, like a flower tower in a theater. So many girls have come again, with their white powder and black eyebrows, sitting on the balcony like a brocade of flowers. The fragrant breeze passes by, and laughter creates spring, attracting the young men and women sitting on the wooden stands opposite to turn their heads to look here from time to time. Because watching the horse race requires at least half an hour between races. After a race is over, the racecourse is deserted, so it's better to turn your head and look at the "interesting ladies" on the balcony. (In Shanghai, beautiful women are called "interesting ladies.") Some even look so dazed that they step into the air and fall. The carriages passing by on the road are also decorated with jewels. The people on the balcony look at them, and they also look at the people on the balcony. There are also a few who originally planned to come to the Mingjing Club, but were later invited by guests to sit in the carriages and couldn't come. But they were still thinking about the sisters who came to the Mingjing Club. When the carriages passed the west end of Nicheng Bridge, they had already raised their heads to look at the balcony. The people on the balcony, seeing that the sisters in the carriages were acquaintances, shouted at them. They also responded. Therefore, it attracted even more people to look at the balcony of the Mingjing Club, as if the balcony of the Mingjing Club was equipped with a huge magnet. There was a piece of iron in the necks of the pedestrians on the road, and they were unknowingly attracted by their attraction. At that time, it was the last time to jump over the barrier. Each jockey mustered their remaining courage to show off their skills. Zheng Yanxiu didn't like watching horse races, but he was among the crowd of heroes. However, everyone shouted to him, "Seventh Young Master, come here." Some said, "Seventh Young Master, there's still a seat here, you can squeeze in." Zheng Yanxiu was like Rousseau in France, often surrounded by flowers and welcomed by them. Zheng Yanxiu said, "This horse race is always the same, there's nothing new. What's there to see? It's just a foreign jockey wearing clothes of various colors, riding on a horse, and everyone vying to be the first to reach the finish line is the winner, and the last to reach the finish line is the loser. It's the same thing even if you run a thousand times. It's better to watch monkeys perform. It's much better to see a monkey riding on a dog in a circle." At that time, this Bi Xiguan said, "Seventh Young Master, come here. This time it's not the same old trick, it's jumping over the barrier. Come and see." As she spoke, she gently stretched out her jade arm and leaned her delicate body, pulling the Seventh Young Master over. Zuo Shichen also made a face at Zheng Yanxiu, smiling and saying, "It's not the same old trick, it's a new trick." That's what Jia Lian said to Wang Xifeng in Dream of the Red Chamber. Fortunately, Bi Xiguan was also clueless. Because Su Jun wasn't here today, Zheng Yanxiu was relatively more free, so he squeezed onto the balcony.</p>

<h3>Gold Soars Past the 500 Taels Mark</h3>
<p>Silver Price Weakens, Foreign Exchange Market Continues Downtrend. Yesterday, gold prices, influenced by a loosening foreign exchange market, continued their decline, albeit fluctuating by one or two taels at times, eventually breaking through the 500 taels mark. Trading among firms was sluggish. Companies such as Yu Da, Fuchang, and Yuanxingyong were sellers, while Hengxing, Wanxing, and Dadecheng were buyers. The market weakened after a large volume of silver was released early in the morning. Subsequently, due to buying activity, exchange rates remained firm. Banks showed some buying interest, causing the price to rebound by over two taels. Later, exchange rates tightened, and due to eager sellers, prices dropped by several cents per tael. Towards the end of the day, Hengxing, Fuchang, Yu Da, and others bought in larger quantities, while Shunli and Wanxing sold. However, market sentiment remained generally flat, with fluctuations limited to a few cents per tael. Foreign exchange seemed to be easing, with June British gold selling to banks at 11 pence 4375. Additionally, Japanese exchange was offered at 1 tael 04 fen. The closing price was 499 taels and some change. The price of British silver rose by 16/3, and the price of silver also rose by 8/3.</p>
<p>Morning Low Reached 98 Taels 1 Qian. The opening price for the May gold contract immediately fell by 4 qian to 500 taels 005 qian. The gross price dropped to 498 and a half taels. Due to active selling and bearish sentiment, combined with hedging purchases and Jardine Matheson's acquisition of June British gold at 11 pence 3125, the price jumped by over 2 taels to 501 taels 1 qian. The initial announcement remained unchanged at 500 taels 003 qian, followed by increases of 3-4 qian. However, the Chinese bank bought June British gold at 11 pence 375, and banks traded April US dollars at 47.25 yuan. Subsequently, they traded June British gold at 11 pence 4375. Sellers on the floor were aggressive, gradually pushing prices lower. After 10 o'clock, the price was only 98 taels 1 qian. Later, Guangdong firms and others bought in, pushing the price up by about 2 taels. After 11 o'clock, the market became increasingly stable. The rate for June Japanese exchange was offered at 1 tael 04 fen 125, causing the price to rise to 500 taels. After 11:30, the price retreated slightly by a few cents. The noon closing price was 99 taels 4 qian, with the announced price still at 517 taels 8 qian, a drop of slightly 17-18 taels.</p>
<p>Afternoon Market Flat, Closing Down 1 Taels 6 Qian. The afternoon market opened at 499 taels 4 qian. Later, sellers became more aggressive, and the exchange rate also loosened. Zhengjin bought near-term US dollars at 47.3125 yuan, and there were rumors that the Indian exchange rate had increased by over 10 yuan, weakening market sentiment, causing a drop of over 1 tael to 98 taels 1 qian. At 2:45, Fuchang and others bought in, raising the price to 499 taels 89 qian. However, Dalian firms sold some, causing a further drop of 1 tael to 98 taels 67 qian. After 3:30, banks absorbed June British gold at 11 pence 4375, which lifted the price by another 1 tael. After 4 o'clock, there were slight fluctuations of a few cents. By 4:30, the price was 499 taels 3 qian. The closing price was down 1 tael 6 qian compared to the previous day. The highest price of the day was 501 taels 1 qian, and the lowest price was 498 taels 1 qian, a difference of 3 taels. The announced price was down over 18 taels, and the book value and supplementary water were both 99 taels. The opening price for goods in the morning was 500.002 qian, the noon closing was 99 taels 3 qian, the afternoon was 9 taels 5 qian, and the closing price was 9 taels 1 qian.</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange: Chinese Merchants Tend to Sell</h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's listed foreign exchange rates showed no fluctuations, except for a 5 qian increase in Hong Kong rates in the afternoon, reaching 80 taels. Large amounts had increased, and the New York silver market was responding to Shanghai market changes. The Indian exchange rate remained at 54 rupees. Yokohama and Kobe showed no significant changes. The domestic exchange rates for British, American, and Japanese currencies in Shanghai weakened slightly. Chinese speculators were inclined to sell, but banks had limited appetite. Bearish sentiment prevailed, and gold prices had broken through the 500 taels mark. Approximately 100,000 pounds of British gold were sold. Banks such as Jardine Matheson, Sumitomo, ICBC, and HSBC absorbed some. Banks also conducted interbank transactions of 40,000-50,000 pounds. Over 200,000 US dollars were sold, with Mitsubishi, Shanghai, Zhengjin, and East Asia absorbing some. Tens of thousands of Japanese yen were sold, with Sumitomo, Banque Belge pour l'Etranger, and Zhengjin buying. However, Chinese merchants remained on the sidelines, as hedging was not profitable. The final closing prices were 125 higher for first call, 25 higher for US dollars, and 375 lower for Japanese exchange compared to the previous day.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Struggles to Break Out of Sideways Trend</h3>
<p>The yarn market is extremely weak due to numerous rumors about the current situation, putting pressure on sellers. However, the base is too small, and there has been no increase in new sellers. Despite the unfavorable environment, it is not easy to see a major drop in the short term. Moreover, although the underlying inventory is large, prices are two to three taels higher than standard prices. There is even less short selling for distant months. Overseas market conditions are firmer than before. The yarn market is likely to remain in a prolonged sideways trend between 52 and 53 taels.</p>
<p>Human Trademark Soft in the Morning, Firm at Noon. The opening of the "Human Trademark" yarn market was marked by bearish sentiment and slightly more selling due to the unfavorable situation. Prices for all months fell by 3 qian. Subsequently, there were more short covering, and prices recovered slightly. Approximately 300 bales of current month #1 were sold. However, short positions for #68 increased by only 1,000 bales. As a result, prices for all months fell by 1.35 qian. The afternoon market was tighter. There were reports of strong demand for coarse yarn from Tianjin firms, and prices for grade 3 yarn were firm, reducing the number of sellers. Prices for all months rose by 1, 2, 4, and 6 qian. Total trading volume for the day was 10,050 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Condition Firm</h3>
<p>The cotton market remains firm, but imported cotton prices have fallen slightly. This is because the supply from various regions is scarce, and there is a lack of cotton of the same quality as the standard. Han firms are holding back some of their current cotton and not selling it, making the situation very firm. It is difficult to be bearish on the current cotton market.</p>
<p>Slight Fluctuations in Han Standard. The opening of the "Han Standard" cotton market was slightly looser due to a slight drop in American cotton prices. Prices for all months fell by 5 fen.

<h3>Grain: River Rice Reaches 20 Yuan</h3>
<p>Zhabei. Few ships arrived yesterday, only about 10. The market still had strong buying interest. Northern glutinous rice continued to rise by 1 jiao due to scarcity, with market prices reaching 20 yuan. If special top-grade glutinous rice were imported from outside the customs, even higher prices could be seen. Medium-grade glutinous rice was also in high demand, trading between 18.5 and 19 yuan, indicating a strong upward trend. Thin rice also rose due to dwindling inventories and eager buyers, increasing by 1.5 jiao. Yangdu Xian rice was still selling well, with market prices gradually rising to 17.6 to 17.7 jiao. However, it was still not profitable compared to prices further inland. Prices for rice from other ports were unchanged. Inventories of Yinbian yuan rice were less than 10 shipments, and sales were active, causing prices to tighten by nearly 1 jiao.</p>
<p>Hunan (Shanghai). Goods coming down the river were increasingly scarce, and the market on this street was slow. If imports were to increase significantly, prices would immediately see unusual gains, leading to a cautious wait-and-see approach. Changxi machine-milled rice and Su Tong white rice still saw large sales volumes, with prices rising by 1 jiao. Second-grade goods saw stable demand. Qing Ding and other thin rice from the South Road were still scarce. All remaining inventories were being purchased by various out-of-town firms, soon to be depleted, leading to gradual gains of 1 jiao or so. Yang Xian rice was selling at a moderate pace, Du Xian rice was in high demand. All types of Xian rice generally saw slight increases. Transactions were slightly lower than the previous day. White yuan rice was in scarce supply and high demand, maintaining a firm position. Xiang Yin yuan rice was opening at around 15.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Imported Rice Rises Wildly Day by Day</h3>
<p>Inland Firms Vying to Procure</p>
<p>Spot Prices Up Over 2 Jiao</p>
<p>Futures Also Up Several Qian</p>
<p>Yesterday's imported rice market became even more intense. Spot prices for goods arriving by river route rose by another 2 jiao. Futures prices also rose by over several qian. The market's tightness was the most pronounced seen this spring. This was due to the extremely high demand from firms in the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, who spared no effort in vying for supplies. Although there were over 100,000 bags newly arrived, after deducting goods being cleared, the remaining quantity was small and was entirely bought up by local firms and firms in this street. Reported spot transactions included 1,000 bags of #1 West Yellow at a price of 15 yuan, 4,000 bags of small size rice at a price of 14.45 yuan, and 4,000 bags of Min Tang rice at a price of 15.5 to 14.7 yuan. 1,000 bags of #2 were priced at 14.7 yuan. Due to production area restrictions, foreign firms dared not sell off futures. Trading in cargo already in port was excellent, with reported transactions of over 5,000 tons. #1 Saigon for April and May was 6 taels 8.5 qian, #2 for March was 6 taels 8 qian, small size rice for March was 6 taels 5 qian, and for April was 6 taels 4.5 qian. River route goods and spot goods were similar in price, with a difference of only 1 or 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>Flour Sales Affected by Current Situation</h3>
<p>Out-of-Town Firms Watching: Bulls and Bears Cease Trading: Market Fluctuates</p>
<p>After the opening in the morning and afternoon yesterday, flour prices for various months generally showed a fluctuating trend. As factories showed little activity, out-of-town firms could only wait and see due to the current situation. Even speculators who went long or short also stopped trading because there was no prospect for development. In terms of factory inventories, there was no large stock of flour, but with sales weak, supplies were more than sufficient. Moreover, foreign wheat continued to arrive in succession. This situation is a major obstacle to the development of the flour market. The subsequent course will depend on the situation. As a result, the price for the current month was the same as the previous day, April was up 5 li, May was down 2 li, June was unchanged, July was up 5 li, and August was up 7.5 li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures: Near-Term Firm, Distant-Term Flat</h3>
<p>Only 1,000 Bags of Spot Wheat Offered</p>
<p>After the opening in the morning and afternoon yesterday, wheat futures for various months showed a trend of near-term firmness and distant-term flatness. As the current month was approaching the delivery date, outside short positions had to be covered, causing the opening price to be firm. For April, there were reports from inland regions of prohibiting wheat exports to prevent food shortages, and foreign wheat prices were slightly better, boosting market sentiment. For distant-term new wheat, as the weather improved, market sentiment was somewhat soft. Although firms in inland regions were unwilling to sell, the market showed signs of weakening. As a result, the price for the current month was up 3 fen from the previous day, April was up 2 fen, June was down 2 fen, July was unchanged, and August was down 1 fen. On the spot market, factory demand was weak as most of the goods available for delivery were of medium and low quality, which was not welcomed by small and medium-sized factories. 1,000 bags of Suzhou wheat were offered at 5 taels 1 qian, Shaoxing wheat at 5 taels, and Jiangxi wheat at 4 taels 6 qian 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Northern Firms Telegraph to Stop Procuring Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Sluggish Market: Prices Mostly Down, Few Up</p>
<p>Piece goods trading was even quieter yesterday. Customer firms were waiting and seeing due to the chaotic situation. Some firms in northern ports even telegraphed to stop procuring goods. Sichuan and Hubei firms also ceased trading, further depressing the market. Goods with relatively large inventories yesterday all declined in price. Yuan Zhi Gongni from East China continued to fall. Mao Yu Shan Lie Yan Mu Qiu opened at 2 qian 5 fen and a half. Changbanqiao opened at 2 qian 6 fen 7 jiao and a half. Baizitu opened at 2 qian 2 fen and sales were quite quiet. Fine Serge fluctuated.

N mark was 7 liang 8 qian, which still felt strong, but compared with the previous day's market, it fell back by 5 fen.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, and Dry Cocoons are Scarce, Factory Management is Driven Up</h3>
<p>The Stock of Dry Cocoons in Shanghai has been Insufficient for a Long Time. Last year, due to insufficient adjustments, manufacturers reduced work and stopped machines. Now that the sales of European and American silk have turned, Shanghai silk factories that continue to operate account for 50-60% of the total. However, the raw materials are not enough to reel silk until the new cocoons are on the market. The existing dry cocoons are only more than 30,000 dan. Currently, Yokohama Japanese silk prices are rising due to the government's financing of huge sums of money. Shanghai factory management has become firm and smooth, and prices have also risen sharply. Yesterday, He Xing and others imported 70 packages of Shanghai white factory silk, and the price rose by more than 10 liang.</p>

<h3>The Answer of Pierre Louÿs</h3>
<p>— Ri An</p>
<p>Pierre Louÿs of France is a newly recognized writer in China who promotes the art of hedonism. Two translations of his works have already appeared in China: one is Li Jinfa's translation of "Ancient Greek Love Songs," and the other is the collaborative translation by Sick Man and Xu Bai of "Flesh and Death" (originally titled "Aphrodite," recently retranslated by Bao Wenwei and renamed "The Sexual Life of Beauty"). Today, I bought a copy of Pierre Louÿs' "Journal Intime," which collects diary entries from 1882 to 1891. The first edition was published in October 1929. Inside, there is a section called "My Opinions," which consists of forty self-answered questions, mostly about literary and artistic matters, and is quite interesting. I have translated and recorded it below:</p>
<p>If someone were to ask me the following questions, I would answer them this way:</p>
<p>1. What is your religion?</p>

<p>Five children, three girls and two boys.</p>
<p>10. How do you explain your politics?</p>

<p>11. What kind of job would you like to do for the rest of your life?</p>
<p>Diplomat. I want to be a diplomat, and I hope to become an ambassador. I know I can do it.</p>

<p>Literary Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Lonely Spring</h3>
<p>— Miao Wu</p>
<p>There are several interesting things about the novel "The Well of Loneliness" published by Covici Friede Company in the United States. The book has been adapted into a play and premiered in Paris last autumn. The United States Post Office has completed its review of the book and deemed it morally sound, allowing it to circulate freely throughout the country. Professors at two universities recommend that students read it as a model for English composition... A woman in Ohio filed for divorce from her husband, citing as grounds the fact that her husband took away her copy of this novel... And what the publishing house is most pleased with is that the book has sold more than 80,000 copies in just a few months after publication.</p>
<p>Chronology of the Latin Poet Ovid</p>
<p>J. G. Frazer is 74 years old, but he still has enough energy to write a "Myth of the Origin of Fire" and a five-volume "Chronology of the Latin Poet Ovid" (Fasti of Ovid). Both books were published by Macmillan Press at the end of last year. The latter book includes a translation and anthropological commentary.</p>

<p>Huilo Imports Household Goods: Huilo Company on Sichuan Road and Nanjing Road announced that its hardware and porcelain department on the third floor recently imported 140 large boxes of kitchen supplies, various porcelain items, various nickel-plated utensils, and other miscellaneous household items. The boxes were opened and displayed yesterday for all to choose from. There are hundreds of different items, all of which are daily necessities for households. The cheapest of the porcelain items is a complete set of porcelain tea sets, with a total of twenty-one pieces, selling for only $6.50. A clever new-style scale costs $3.50 per piece.

<p>Preparation of Hygiene Pepper Powder Company: Pepper powder is a major ingredient in food seasonings. Usually, the stores only sell it as an accessory in pharmacies. The old method of preparation is not hygienic. Because the needs of the Chinese people are not widespread, no one has advocated improvement, resulting in the encroachment of foreign goods and the loss of rights every year. Now, more than ten Shanghai merchants, including Huang Yizhai, Huang Yuzhai, Zhu Jianshan, Xia Bingqian, and Chen Bin, have initiated the establishment of a hygiene pepper powder machine powder co., Ltd., in order to promote national goods, resist foreign products, improve food, and restore rights and interests. A preparatory office has been set up at No. 306, Meiren Lane, east end of Shilu Road, Sanma Road. Yesterday, the initiators convened the first preparatory meeting, elected Huang Yizhai as the director of the preparatory office, Xia Bingqian and Chen Bin as the deputy directors, and passed the articles of association and all preparatory procedures. Chinese medicine practitioner Chen Shimei was hired to be responsible for the refining and preparation of chemistry and products. It is said that it can be established and opened by the end of April.</p>
<p>Dog Exhibition to Open: The China Dog Breeding Association announced that this year's dog exhibition will be held at the Shanghai Racecourse on May 17. In order to arouse public interest in joining the dog race, several new styles have been added. Dogs that have never won a first prize are classified into the preliminary round. Dogs born in China, once considered difficult, can compete with those shipped from abroad, and are classified into the Chinese product category. There is also an international category, in which the race owners are divided into countries such as China, France, Germany, Britain, the United States, etc. There is also a double race category, in which the dogs must come from the same breed and belong to the same owner. The exhibition time this year is from the afternoon, hoping to facilitate the visit of the majority of guests. All booklets, registration forms, etc. are being printed and will be available in about ten days. Those who wish to join the association may register with Mr. Ge Lin of the Liqu Steel Plant, No. 8 Museum Road, Shanghai.</p>
