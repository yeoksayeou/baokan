<p>華人遠征足球隊隊長李惠堂</p>
<p>﹁焉得腰纒十萬貫領隊一試歐羅巴﹂這不是去歲在我南征日記中的希望語嗎韶光易逝轉眼不覺又一年了在這一年當中我雖然得不着腰緾十萬貫的幸福但是到了現在征歐的幻想竟演成事實了不特歐行達到了目的而且還擴而張之我們這次行程表裏面也把加拿大美利堅包括在內作環繞地球一週的壯舉</p>
<p>我月來行了最倒霉的運自全運而至於達運我素來好動的軀體却被那無情的病魔弄到我服帖帖地和枕褥做了兩個多月的良伴病愈又加上足患以致全遠兩運均不能參加病而不時眞使我萬分愧恨而自怨天差幸近來甚麼都告痊了不過在我精神未復元氣尙衰之時我的懶性實在比平時加上幾倍尤其是執起了禿筆總覺着有千幾百斤的重量但是日來報載關於這次遠征的新聞却把我的懶筋振醒了我覺著日來的記事其間微有出入尤其與論方面更含蓄著反宣傳而有破壞作用的意味在我們鼙鼓冬冬大軍將發的當兒不得著各界的贊助和鼓勵而反受著這種不如意的反響眞使我茫然索解骨鯁喉中我實在不能忍了趁未離香島之前我要向各界把遠因近果和盤地托出</p>
<p>我這次先行南下其實全係爲著私事並無甚麼公務和專責旣無專責便談不到成功和失敗破壞者日惟加緊工作大吹其某某失敗的牛皮欺人自欺庸者自擾委實使我笑不可仰</p>
<p>征歐的動機遠在三年前不過年來困於種種障礙欲行而卒於行不得者再去歲滬上名裁判李思廉因假返國因乘其便舊議重提遂得死灰復燃籌備半載各事逐漸就範從前的夢境不久便將一幕幕地由虛幻而演成事實了我在未</p>
<p>談別項之先這裏却有待解釋者三</p>
<p>㈠名稱關於這次征隊的名稱卻引起極大的問題外間人們疑惑我們因爲事事都由樂華發動和組織不難就冠以樂華二字了其實我們又何嘗有這種的意思呢不過因爲和對方接洽非有一正式機關是不行的致於出師時的名稱我們旣早有成竹預定用﹁華人遠征足球隊﹂ChineseAmatureSoccerTeam樂華範園狹而不適用我們縱愚亦不致於舍廣而就狹啊</p>
<p>㈡業餘與受薪這個資格問題也發生很扼要的研究但是照我現在所知球員每人將來所得如服裝費日用小費等等都是業餘界所許的而且最大的保障是日後班師返國之時全隊的賬目都要經過英國足球總會的會計師核准我記得一九二七年澳征之前後也有不良份子想破壞而欲加隊員以受薪的罪名但是結果却一敗塗地這番各員的待遇和那次征澳的小異大同受蔡的嫌疑可不庸熱心家的過慮</p>
<p>㈢渣華之游前幾天反宣傳者曾說這次遠征隊是極其危險的你看他們經費無着尙須至南洋方面籌措啊這種論調可笑之至我們先游渣華是有兩因㈠因爲去年樂華南征的成績優異所以華僑們特地請我們順便重游一遍㈡爲着歐洲方面球季未臨我們好趁這機會先至南洋作一番練習來研究我隊的合作未雨綢繆始可謂智反宣傳傳家啊你未免神經過敏了</p>
<p>解釋完了之後我又要一談這番遠征的益處和目的</p>
<p>但凡球隊出征異地除了得着游覺風景增廣見聞的實益外最要的還算爲國宣傳和增進球技兩種我國年來政府外交的失敗是不庸自譯的了雖則我們體育也相見絀落後千丈但是能有體育界代表出外宣傳誰也公認是比較外交家大文豪所收的效果來得迅妙兩次澳行種下的子實現在旣開着燦爛的花果了這次球隊游遍全歐而至於加美一定能一新外人尤其是小國的人對我中華的心理看罷致於增進藝術尤爲我國今日足球界的先務試想華人在港滬兩地年來的成績可謂非常超卓了但是最近的遠運竟和後進的日人秋色平分雖說這次不能全勝是有很多的原因但我們停舟中流長處國內而固步自封不特進境遲濃而且還有不淮而退的危境此番遠征各國球技優異和賽時變化必多吸收人長其將來歸國灌輸裨益眞不可以道里計</p>
<p>還有關於這次的人材如何是各界所急欲知的我們的宗旨當然是設法搜集最優秀的份子不過其中常有各種不可思議的困難以致結果不償初願據我私人的見解以爲如果沒有甚麼十分爲難的地方個人方面爲着公私兩僧兼收起見無論犧牲到甚麼田地也值得攘臂從師至於會社方面爲首互相提携爲國生材起見也應該放遠眼光設法盡量地多派能手參加以便將來返國服務爲足球界後進造福現在據我所知港方球星確有兩三不能偕行最近辦事人方面祇得力求其次因爲我們這番無論如何爲着保存信譽起見不能再延此舉手不能行則求其次次者不能行則求其再次甚至於完全無人應召時差不多趙大孫二也要補足一隊爲的是我們目的是出外採取新智識並非像孤憤生日前所說的一定要戰勝始爲榮又何况一談勝負便失了體育的眞諦呢所以遠征全體名單因着我們還要在南洋方面物色好手非待由星洲出發時不能完全定奪不過照現在隨師的球員勢力而觀最低限度也可給外人一塲良好的表演而使他們意足心滿</p>
<p>末了我很熱烈地希望我們這番遠游𫌥吸獲最深的實益能不負各個的犧牲一方面我極盼望國內的體育界因着這次遠東失敗的刺激從此後再不可以懸徵鏡來觀察事物應該從暸遠鏡頭上做工夫把爲個人爲已會的私利惡風掃除浮盡大家手挽着手來替中國改進來替體育界謀未來的幸福請了動程在即下次再談罷</p>

<p>書報介紹冷的心曲湯增歇　　宋琴心作　　詩是文藝範疇上最高形式的表現不但作者須具有熱烈的感情豐富的想像而且一句一字都要經過精練的苦心將自己整個的眞情貫注注於行間傳入於讀者愛美的心靈在無形中能夠喚發出同情悲嘆或懽笑所以詩底價值是怎樣的偉大它能陶冶讀者苦悶的心情它更能鎔化讀者固有的成性詩是多麼值得我們的歌詠尤其是感着多方面煩悶的青年因爲在真情流露的詩句裏或許可能尋找到詩人賜予我們的一點精神上的安慰雖然這安慰的分量是很細小的　　在我們中華的文藝園中說起來真個貧弱得可憐同時讀者受了性愛小說的誘惑失支了鑑賞文藝的目的與真本能以求在文藝作品中尋找一些暫時的變熊的性愛底滿足不管這書在藝術上的價值如何更不顧我們讀了能夠獲益與否衹求內容對於性愛有熱烈的描寫超越的表現便能吸引青年讀者的心而且青年讀者還承認它是一本好書假使一個真正忠實於藝術的作者用了全副精神和毅力寫下篇代表的力作對於「性」的方面很少的述及那麼我可大胆地說是决不會獲得大多數觀衆的反而遭一般讀者的吐棄在目前這是一個很顯問的事實　　至於詩根本就是被排擯之例不管是一本好的詩集或者是一本壞的詩集出版之後總是擺在書店的高架上不能引起顧客的青睞的在另一方面雖然是許多不了解文藝爲何物的作者對於「詩」底濫造使讀者失去鑑賞的重心也是一個很大的原因但泰半還是歸罪於讀者祇視文藝作品爲變熊性愛的滿足機忘去了「詩」底本來的實質是比任何作品都值得鑑賞的了　　最近一兩年來在華文藝園裏對於詩集的發現却很少真正偉大的詩集更有如「鳳毛麟角」的了這實不是好的現象大可以使國際文壇上的人物看低我國讀者的鑑賞能力的薄弱同時看輕了我國文藝的「沒落」愛好再努力文藝的人應該毫不遲疑的對藝術最高形式的表現「詩」特別用心地注重起來　　宋琴心作的這本「冷的心曲」內容雖然不能說它是成熟的東西但是能在中華寂寞詩壇上發現却是值得我們讚許的因爲現在所出版的詩集委實是太少了　　自古詩人多悲哀已成爲傳統的一個左證這本「冷的心曲」祇須看他這樣的題名便可顯然地明瞭內中所載的詩都是屬於傷感一類的毌須再細細地歌詠一首一首長短不齊的詩句了實際不然詩人雖古今中外都有悲哀的共通點但有時竟有不相同的地方這當然因爲環境的差異感觸的不一所寫固各有各的巧妙之點但整個的心總跳不出「煩惱之綱」與一「悲哀之域」老實說不到窮愁無法際也不會有真正偉大的詩情表露出來　　全書僅二十二首詩值得歌詠的實在寥寥「冷的心曲」比較算最好的一首作者顯然對於舊詩詞的過深雖然每首都是用着新形式來表現但是其中有許多詩句完全脫不掉舊詩詞的風味有的簡直竟是舊詩詞中的字句在作者又不是獨自創關一條代表自己的新路所以用這樣手腕來寫詩是很易趨於「流俗」的使讀者僅獲得一種很淺薄的印象不過不要如舊詩詞一樣的過於爲音韻所拘束反而失去了眞的感情專在用字或造句上推敲則又要犧牲掉𣝢質明白的詩底美所以在文藝範疇上詩的表現可以眞是藝術的最高峯很難表現得盡善盡美的然而自然的音節和抑揚的拍調是要稍稍顧及不能整個的棄於詩情之外「冷的心曲」的作者對於音韻自然的音節丨實在是太疎忽了有些竟不能使我們如「詩」一樣的歌記詠　　這裏面的詩最佳點是作者情緒的緊張表現力亦強例如　　你曾曾給花開欣歡的臉朧　　你曾曾給蛾蝶舞蹈的歌塲　　你曾曾給人們擈鼻的香滋　　　而今呢鮮花呵落也如斯（冷的心曲）　　村莊裏有蘆花浮盪的沉睡的河溝　　村莊裏有石欄繞邊的悄坐的片橋　　村莊裏有黃葉點綴的搖曳的枝梢　　村莊裏有牆壁殘頺的呆立的高樓　　：：：：：：：：：（朝露）　　這裏字句雖然是很整齊但還不嫌怎樣過分的雕刻所表現的情緒卻非常的緊張大有一口氣呵成之勢作者將當時威官裏的盼及的都赤裸地一筆很有力的寫下來了這樣的述景方可算得是「眞」在表情也應該注意到這點同時還要具有很豐富的聯想　　在全部詩篇裏可以看出作者是極度悲哀的一個青年詩人失了愛人的心自己淪於的孤獨的凄境這本來是一般青年人中最普遍的現象但經過詩人的描寫便格外地動人竟能使讀者同情　　孤另地幽囚在這冷清的鼓山之麓　　淒情愁緒盤據心頭無限呵哀傷　　想往昔深閨裏絮語清談　　月明夜花院中琴歌彈唱　　而今而今漂落異鄉凄度冷青苦斷心腸　　離愁萬千疊塞心頭那堪收拾　　瑟瑟的山風狂吹渡濺流　　任連砍波流也難吹流我滿懷愁絲　　我惟有把這縷縷織就情變幅幅　　寄給伊訴出我懇切的熱烈的思想（離愁）　　這首「離愁」我們讀過了之後可以窺見作者整個傷別的情緒迴憶過去撫惜今後都不竟不能抑制的要「苦斷心腸」這一點當然是值得讚賞但在現今悲哀的意識實不是一般青年所需要應該體騐到整個中華民族的意識上去要以時的形式來表現我們民族的中心思想同時也要將國際問民族優秀性的特點吸收過來貫注於詩的內容裏這詩無須說是含有偉大的生命傅留於永久在世界文壇上獲得詩的光耀無疑地即是中華民族的光耀了而且在這「離愁」的詩篇裏也可以看出作者受了量舊詩詞的影響這還不打緊最重要是在乎能急切地創關一條自己寫詩的新路有力的表現中華民族新精神要曉得現時代是不需要歌謳個人的悲哀了　　作者在過分的悲哀中有時也發奮着喚起了未來的希望但終於因爲他的自信力太弱歌謳不出一條新的光明的進路結果還是被悲哀的意識所征服仍就歌謳自己固有的舊把戲這也是作者意志薄弱的缺點不能下唯一向上的决心跑到光明的希望的大道上去　　　現在的時代處處都要促進我們青　年人向上不該淪入於悲哀之途永久不希望光明來臨的尤其是青年詩人非脫下戲傷之慢掉去悲哀之筆努力喚醒中華民族意識的詩歌才可我希望「冷的心曲」的作者也是如此上海每周論壇　　文質四川路中央大厦八號發行　　在過去書報介紹關於報的介紹工作確是很少我以爲報的介紹至低限度該和書在平行線上因爲旣然無疑的報的功能力量較書大在各方面的簡便於是銷行易廣且能易深入一般但是其益人固多翻過來說誤入者亦多那末要使社會大衆的讀者不致受騙並且也可藉此鼓勵出版界向更進步的健全路上走報的介紹是不能疏忍的　　本來上海的出版界眞夠稱得上一個瘋狂當我們跑進包羅萬象的書店幾直會不知所措起來其實不是別的不用說質即量的方面也不見多所頭痛者就是那些胖子吃巴豆粉的大量出產買了會連一遍都看不完就會藏之高閣的所謂報當然也逃不出例外上海是盛行小報攤每個小報攤整整齊齊排列的至少有數十種這其中値得供給讀者一讀的多少內容怎樣能夠不使人躊躇彷徨嗎是了開話少說總之我們很難找到一份完備的報　　「上海每週論壇」還是異軍突起的牠收集材料的範圍很廣不限於單一方面的尤其「一周新聞」供給讀者不少難於知到的消息當我細看了後實覺有介紹的必要在這「報」鬧的一團糟的時候我們的讀者或可不憂無報可看了現在且拿最新出版的第四期檢閱一下　　最近上海的文藝界似乎起了一種特別的刺戟力把「混戰」局面的文壇進入「論戰」局面的文壇了就是本月初旬民族主義文藝運動者所發表的民族主義文藝運動宣言使中國的文壇藝壇確立了一個中心的意識這未來自然引起了多方面的鷔駭好像有什麼怒潮或洪水來臨似的其實呢這是沒有什麼大不了的文藝便是一個民族的文化的最高的表　現如果我們確認民族的存在當表贊同晚近弱小民族的要求民族自决運動日趨熱烈因之在這衝要的時代越發需要發揚此時代的精神以求世界各民族一　律平等所以文藝民族意識之確立誠是不可否認的事實「每周論壇」爲留心吾國文藝者之參攷特覓得該宣言原文披露出來必然我們看了更明瞭民族主義文藝運動者的努力　　潘公展先生的「對於爭自由的認識」這裏已是二續完了中國人的壞脾氣便是好「新」不管是好是歹只要是「來路貨」便趨之若鶩然而這到還在次最不高明的莫如曲解釋誤解自由本是一個很中聽的名詞誰不想「自由」呢誰願終天終晚受到不「自由」的束縛但是「自由」是二方面的侵犯他人之自由便不是「自由」不侵犯他人之自由才是眞實的「自由」中國人却只知過「自由」二字便完了而不去研究「自由」的眞理所在這是大錯大錯第三個大錯公展先生爲駁斥那些誤解和曲解不但開發了充分的理論而且把一般不知「自由」眞諦者下以清凉劑　　現在大多數人便以爲民權就是人權了或者便是絕對的論人權於更懈涉</p>

<p>He Chengjun in Hankou convened a military conference on the 7th. Xu Yuanquan, Yang Hucheng, and Xiao Zhichu were all present. The plan has been telegraphed to Chiang Kai-shek for review. He Chengjun also telegraphed that our army had occupied Qinkou and other places on the 8th, capturing countless prisoners. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Wei Wo-wei, a brigade commander, has been promoted to deputy division commander of the 54th Division in Hankou. The appointment order was sent to Luo by the General Headquarters on the 9th, ordering him to take office immediately. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Military News from Zhumadian 1. Liu Ruming's troops were routed by our Fan Division in the Guanghua area on the 3rd and are no longer a cohesive force. According to prisoners, Xue Chengde and Li Jintian, the bandit leaders of Liu's unit, have realized their error and are willing to surrender with their remaining forces, offering to deliver Liu Ruming as a condition. 2. Sun Dianying's army secretly sent a fake chief of staff, Zhang Luan (字雅齋), to our side to incite dissension in the army.</p>
<p>Xu Yuanquan, the army commander, discovered this and placed the chief of staff under house arrest in the military headquarters, hoping he would reflect on his actions. However, Zhang Luan did not repent and even colluded with the guarding soldiers in hopes of escaping. Army Commander Xu sent the criminal to the Third Army Corps headquarters. After interrogation by Commander-in-Chief He, he confessed to colluding with the army and was executed by firing squad at the Zhumadian execution ground on the 4th. 3. The various miscellaneous troops on the Ping-Han front, unwilling to suffer the abuse of Feng Yuxiang, have all sent representatives to contact Commander-in-Chief He. It is expected that there will be a major change in the rear of the rebel army within ten days, at which time our army can take advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>and directly seize Xu Zheng. 4. Because both the Ping-Han and Long-Hai lines were lost, Feng Yuxiang resorted to his old tricks and sent Zhang to deliver an appointment and official seal to Yang Hucheng, the commander-in-chief of the 11th Route Army. After receiving it, Commander Yang personally brought it to Commander-in-Chief He in Luohe on the 5th, asking He to forward it to Commander-in-Chief Chiang. Zhang is still being held in Nanyang and will be escorted to the capital by Commander Yang in the coming days. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Representatives from Various Provinces Urgently Seek to Form a Government</p>
<p>Zhao Pilian Receives Personnel from the Japanese Embassy</p>
<p>A certain diplomat from Beiping said that the representatives of the provinces think the resolution of party affairs is too slow in forming a government, so they plan to take a more direct approach to produce a new government for foreign affairs and fundraising.</p>
<p>There is a way to do it. You must know that it is not that we do not respect the party. The party itself is in a deadlock and cannot blame us for thinking of other ways, he said. However, yesterday Zhao Pilian invited the left and right-wing party committees to receive all the personnel of the Japanese embassy at Huairentang. Zou, Xie, Chen, and Bai all said that there would be a way to resolve party affairs soon and a government would be organized in Beiping. Japanese embassy officials said that now that they have seen the left and right wings of your country gathered together, they believe that they can organize an expanded conference in the north to form a government according to Yan's proposal. At that time, it was raining heavily, and the Chinese and Japanese guests talked for three and a half hours. Zou and Xie were especially attentive. Finally, Japanese representative Yada said that he had a close personal relationship with Yan and you all, and hoped for smooth development. Then the guests cheered "Long Live the Chinese Kuomintang!" and "Long Live the Japanese Empire!" and the meeting adjourned. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing The Central Committee sent a telegram to Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, saying, "Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek of Liuhe, and all commanders and soldiers of all routes, In the four years since that day, the Central Committee has entrusted Comrade Chiang Chung-cheng with the mission of leading the troops and working with all the officers and soldiers of our National Revolutionary Army to eliminate warlords and complete unification. Over the past four years, all officers and soldiers have fought bravely and worked tirelessly to achieve today's achievements. Now, the remnants of the Yan, Feng, and Gui factions have repeatedly rebelled and disrupted peace. All the officers and soldiers of our revolution, upholding the legacy of the Prime Minister, have worked with the Central Committee to eliminate the rebels and have achieved great success. The rebels of Li, Bai, Zhang, and Huang have been defeated in Guangxi and Hunan. The rebellious armies of Yan and Feng have been repeatedly defeated in Henan and Shandong. We are deeply gratified by the frequent reports of victory. All the officers and soldiers of our revolution, who have traveled far in the hot weather, have worked hard. However, if the roots of the remaining rebels are not eradicated for a day, the responsibility of the revolution will not be relieved for a day. It is hoped that we will all embody the spirit of the Central Committee's appointment of commanders and oath to launch the expedition five years ago, and strive to annihilate the enemy and eliminate evil, so as to permanently establish a foundation of peace and unification for the country, and open up a long-term path of prosperity for the nation.

<h3 id="e12">Sharp Increase in Unemployment in Britain and the United States <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>According to Reuters, the number of unemployed in Britain exceeded 1.89 million on June 30, an increase of 75,000 from the previous week. According to the New York Newsletter, the unemployment situation in the United States is worse than last year, with 3.9 million people unemployed nationwide, but this does not include office workers and farm laborers. It can be seen that the impact of the economic recession on Britain and the United States, which are known as the most developed countries in industry and commerce, is increasing day by day. If this situation continues for several months or years, the increase in the number of unemployed in these countries will inevitably be more severe than today, and other famous industrial and commercial countries will undoubtedly be similarly affected.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a survey of Japan's trade with China in June, it decreased by 23 million yuan compared to June of the previous year. It can be seen that the sales of Japanese goods in China have invisibly declined considerably. According to foreign sources in this port, the textile industry in Shanghai is gradually declining, and rumors of wage cuts are frequent. Recently, Sanxin, a Chinese company, has stopped night shifts, and Jardine Matheson, a British company, will also stop night shifts in mid-June. There are also two or three other Chinese companies that need to implement wage cuts. After this, the production volume of Chinese and British yarn factories will decrease by 50%, and the production volume of Japanese companies will decrease by 30%. It can be seen that the impact of the economic recession is harming everywhere. Even Shanghai, which has a limited industrial development, has this phenomenon. Alas, the future of the world's economic crisis is still unknown.</p>

<p>Powerful figures in Nanjing have recently repeatedly complained that Shanghai residents are attracted to dog racing tracks and similar gambling dens, resulting in the squandering of wealth and the ruin of families. There are many such cases. The government is therefore considering whether to use the judicial power of the special district court to directly arrest and prosecute Chinese citizens for illegal gambling activities. Last year, the government seriously negotiated with the Shanghai Consular Body and the Municipal Council on this matter to crack down on dog racing tracks, but there has been no concrete result. Therefore, it is now planned to bypass diplomatic procedures and directly punish Chinese people who manage dog racing tracks and engage in gambling. According to investigations by those responsible for this matter, this kind of heinous gambling must be prohibited. It is deeply and thoroughly harmful to the economic life of the Chinese people in Shanghai, especially at a time when industry and commerce are declining. It is unacceptable to allow it to exist. It is said that once the investigation procedures are completed, reports will be made to the relevant authorities so that measures can be taken immediately to eliminate this evil demon that endangers society and the people's livelihood.

<p>▲Reuters, London, 8th The Parliament was slightly tense tonight. Members believed that several storms were brewing and would spread to the government seats tomorrow. First, the leaders of the Labour Party and the Liberal Party disagreed on the unemployment relief plan. Second, an important amendment to the budget by the Liberal Party may receive an unfavorable vote. Third, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party now suspect that the government does not want to submit the Simon Commission's report to the Indian Round Table Conference, intending to put the document on hold. The Governor of India will make a statement on this matter tomorrow. If his statement is not satisfactory to the opposition party, the budget amendment will inevitably be affected. Fourth, the House of Lords and the House of Commons have different opinions on the coal bill. It is likely that the government will abandon its plan.

<p>▲Reuters, Simla, 9th Today, Governor-General Irwin of India delivered a speech in both houses of the Legislative Council, announcing that after careful consideration, the British government has decided that the Round Table Conference to be held in London in the future to discuss the Indian issue should enjoy the full freedom contained in his message issued on November 1 last year. Therefore, the conference can proceed freely with its work, and although it is subject to great assistance, its freedom will never be restricted by the Simon Committee's report. The British government now believes that a solution that is satisfactory and acceptable to all parties involved in the conference can be reached between Britain and India. Any agreement reached at the conference can serve as the basis for the British government to submit proposals to Parliament at a later date. The British government believes that this conference is not just a meeting for discussion, but a joint meeting of British and Indian representatives. The British government hopes that all thoughtful Indians will be prepared to share the work of construction. He said that he does not believe that this conference cannot come up with a plan that will give pessimists no reason to speak. The Governor-General continued by saying that the dominion status announced in the declaration last year is the natural maturation of India's constitutional development. This book still exists today. The Simon Report can be regarded as a powerful and constructive contribution to the most difficult problem. However, the wishes and duties of the committee are not to bind the British government in the decisions of the Round Table Conference or Parliament. The Indian government has only conducted a preliminary study of this report. He believes that it is necessary to first discuss it with representatives of the non-political circles of India before making any decisions on the Simon Report. He also said that the government intends to continue to suppress the dangerous non-violent resistance movement. He is willing to advise the public in the capacity of a friend rather than the Governor of India to promote the spirit of mutual trust to eliminate all barriers. There are now two paths for this audience to choose one is to lead to confusion, division, and disappointment, and the other is to make India an honorable member of the free and democratic group. He sincerely hopes that the Indians will follow the right path. The Governor-General concluded by saying that he intends to dissolve the Council of State in a timely manner so that the elections for both houses can be held in September. He then said that the overall situation on the Northwest Frontier is improving day by day. The conflict between Nepal and Tibet has disappeared after the Indian government sent a delegation to Lhasa to have friendly exchanges with the Dalai Lama.</p>

<p>Swanson Supports Hoover's Proposal</p>
<p>Opposition Demands Review of Documents</p>
<p>▲Associated Press, Washington, 8th Senator Swanson spoke in support of President Hoover's proposal urging the Senate to pass the London Naval Treaty at the second day's special session today. He said that if the United States rejects the treaty, it will be condemned by London and Tokyo. The United States' intention to adopt imperialism and control the future of the two countries, this treaty must cost the United States a huge sum of one thousand trillion yuan. However, if this treaty is not adopted, the cost of naval support in the future will far exceed this, reaching 2,000,000,000 yuan. Shi then asked a question, saying that Japan had previously formed an alliance with Britain and then identified the Treaty of Versailles as the 1922 agreement. They have been able to abide by and maintain an open-door policy with the United States. The above points are sufficient to prove that the country's international credibility is reliable. However, since the recent London Naval Treaty case, a group of people have suddenly become fearful and worried about Japan. I really don't know the reason. Judging from the current situation, there is no possibility of a split between the United States and Japan. The US-Japan war is not only unprofitable to the US, but also harmful to Japan. The submarine rate set in the naval treaty is sufficient. Submarines are of no use at all in the vast sea. They are only useful for protecting the estuary. Therefore, in terms of the safety of the Pacific Ocean, submarines are of little use except for Manila. ▲Associated Press, Washington, 8th When the Senate was meeting today, after Shi vigorously advocated the passage of the naval treaty, Senator Johnson, a navalist, stood up and spoke in support of the proposal made by Mr. McKellar yesterday, advocating that the Senate should ask the President again to hand over all secret documents related to the naval treaty. Subsequently, the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Pola, stated that the release of some documents by Mr. Mai's proposed amendment will hinder the public interest. At the end of the statement, if the amendment cannot be agreed by the meeting, he will still support Mr. McKellar's original proposal. During the debate, Secretary of State Stimson went to the hospital to listen for days because the naval treaty was handled by himself, and his wife also came to a stop.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, London, 8th Dr. Hills, Undersecretary of the Colonial Department, stated to the representatives attending the Colonial Office Conference today the colonial policy of the Labour government, saying that democracy is a dangerous thing if it is not effective and scientifically guided. For this reason, the government urgently wants to obtain suitable talents for administrators and experts. Since taking office, the Labour Party has never issued revolutionary instructions, nor has it advocated extreme changes in the old policies, knowing that the administrative guidelines for overseas territories should not be easily changed with domestic political changes. However, any government has its policy focus, such as the forced labor of local workers and the situation of local workers, which are events to which the principles of the Labour Party should be applied. The current government not only trusts the trusteeship principle, but also trains the governed people to develop their full capabilities in all aspects, especially paying attention to the final autonomy.</p>

<p>▲New York News The President of the American Federation of Labor, Green, declared that the unemployment situation in the United States today is worse than last year. There are 3.9 million unemployed people in the country, while the investigation figures released by Commerce Minister Lamont are that there are a total of 2,298,588 unemployed workers, accounting for 2% of the total population.

Green estimates that the wages earned by American wage earners lost due to unemployment in the first six months of this year exceeded 200 million yuan.

<p>Transferring National Debt to Local Areas</p>
<p>Breaking Through Austerity Policies</p>
<p>Political Association Executives Decide to Send Teams</p>
<p>To Investigate the National Economic Situation</p>
<p>▲ From Tokyo, 9th (via Electric Communication): Since the current government took office, it has emphasized administrative economization, with the central government strictly adhering to the principle of not raising debt, boasting of a so-called [budget without borrowing]. In reality, no matter how much the government advocates austerity, there are absolutely essential public works projects that cannot be stopped. Therefore, the burden of these projects has been transferred from the central government to local budgets, allowing the issuance of local bonds to continue the projects. On the surface, the government claims that permitting local bonds is to relieve unemployment. However, these local bonds will continue to increase in the future. The so-called principle of not raising debt for the central government is essentially completely overturned; it merely shifts national debt to local debt. If the current policy continues for two or three years, the interest burden on local areas alone will reach a substantial amount. Local organizations, suffering from the government's policies, are already finding it extremely difficult to borrow money. There are signs that the deposit department of the Ministry of Finance is delaying interest payments on local bonds it has underwritten. This shows the ugliness of the government's policy of "covering its head while exposing its buttocks," and is also one of the government's cunning policy shifts.</p>
<p>▲ From Tokyo, 9th (via Electric Communication): Yesterday afternoon, the Political Association held an executive meeting at its headquarters. Secretary-General Mori reported that the Navy Ministry has decided to save 19 million yuan in this year's budget. In reality, this is not saving, but rather suspending work, leaving workers idle and unemployed. The meeting then discussed dispatching economic investigation teams to various parts of the country to investigate the truth of the economic downturn. The following decisions were made: 1. The economic investigation teams will be divided into five groups, centered on Fukuoka, Osaka, Nagoya, Sendai, and Sapporo, with ten members dispatched to each location. 2. Each team must thoroughly investigate the state of unemployment, the truth of unemployment relief, the reality of reduced income for small and medium-sized business operators, tax payment status, and the general causes of the economic downturn.</p>

<p>14th Session</p>
<h3 id="e38">Important Topics of the International Labour Conference <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva Snipe Communication)</p>
<p>This International Labour Conference was held in Geneva on June 10th of this year. There were representative delegations from as many as fifty-one countries, including eighty-six government representatives, thirty-five employer representatives, and thirty-five employee representatives (the International Labour Organization has a total of fifty-five member states), making it an unprecedentedly grand event. The important issues discussed at this session of the conference are listed below:</p>
<p>1. The problem of prohibiting forced labor</p>
<p>2. The problem of regulating the working hours of shop assistants</p>
<p>3. The problem of regulating the working hours of coal miners</p>
<p>According to reports, the first and second issues were initially discussed at the 12th International Labour Conference the previous year, after which the International Labour Office drafted initial draft convention and recommendation drafts, which were submitted to this conference for resolution. These two draft proposals have been adopted by the conference and have become formal draft conventions and recommendations. After the conference is adjourned, they will be submitted to the governments of various countries for approval in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the International Labour Office's initial draft prohibiting forced labour is to prohibit all forced labour within a certain period of time. Forced labour arising from personal interests shall be strictly limited to three years and must be abolished. The time allowed for forced labour arising from public interests is slightly longer, but within this time the draft convention provides for appropriate safeguards (according to the forced labour is a semi-slave work system in the colonies of European and American countries, which has been criticized by modern public opinion, so there is an urgent need to abolish it). Regarding the issue of working hours for shop assistants, the initial draft of the International Labour Office stipulates that working hours shall be 48 hours per week and, in principle, 8 hours per day, but may be extended to 10 hours under special circumstances (according to the draft convention regulating tiger work hours, it was passed by the first International Labour Conference in 1919, but the 1919 convention only applies to industrial workers and not to commercial shop assistants, so this conference will re-discuss this issue to the coal miners, the convention was drafted within in the above-mentioned draft agreement). Regarding the working hours of coal miners, although the convention decided by the above-mentioned first International Labour Conference already included this issue, there are no detailed provisions for the special circumstances of the mining industry, so the main purpose of this draft convention is to limit the time of each miner in the mine (including the time going up and down the mine) to no more than seven and a half hours per day and no more than forty-five hours per week, but within three years, it is specially allowed to extend the above time to seven hours and forty-five minutes per day or forty-six and a half hours per week. In addition to the above three issues, this conference also had various proposals. Although the nature of the proposals themselves does not give rise to any binding force, they can become an initial step in the discussion of a formal issue. For example, at this session, the Indian workers' representatives made a proposal requesting the conference to ask the board of directors of the International Labour Office to convene a labour conference of Asian countries in the near future, with representatives from both labour and management participating as usual. The conference would be dedicated to studying the labour problems in the East and report to the ordinary National Labour Conference in order to solve the labour problems in the Far East.</p>

<h3 id="e39">A Memorial for the Northern Expedition Oath-Taking <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>▲ July 9th marked the fourth anniversary of the Northern Expedition Oath-Taking of the National Revolutionary Army. The Central Party Headquarters held a memorial ceremony in the main hall at 9:00 AM. Above the hall hung purple and green streamers with the inscription "[Long Live the Success of the National Revolution]" in the center, flanked by slogans such as "[Emulate the Northern Expedition soldiers' noble character of distinguishing between right and wrong, placing the nation above self and the public above the private]" and "[Promote the spirit of the Northern Expedition soldiers who were not afraid of difficulties or death, sacrificing for the people and fighting for the Party]". Pine and green streamers were also tied outside the gate, with slogans displayed. Attendees included Hu Hanmin, Dai Chuanxian, Sun Ke, Gu Yingfen, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Li Wenfan, Yu Jingtang, Shao Yuanchong, Wang Chonghui, Wang Bocui, Lin Sen, Chen Zhaoying, Liu Luyin, Enke Batu, and representatives from various ministries, departments, and commissions of the government, totaling about six to seven hundred people. Hu Hanmin chaired the meeting, and the ceremony proceeded as usual.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Important News Two <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>After Chair Hu Hanmin opened the meeting, he gave a report on the course and achievements of the National Revolutionary Army's Northern Expedition Oath-Taking, stating that the Party, inheriting the General's revolutionary cause, was striving to advance the revolutionary work, eliminate the warlords who were hindering domestic unification, and achieve freedom and equality among nations. Therefore, on this day four years ago, the oath-taking ceremony was held in Guangzhou, and Comrade Chiang was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief to carry out the Northern Expedition. Chiang had a deep understanding of the Party's principles and was able to bear the Party's mission with a strong and unwavering spirit, fulfilling his duty as a revolutionary soldier. Therefore, in the shortest possible time, he laid the foundation for the Central Plains and achieved the initial success of peaceful unification. After the period of military administration came to an end, he urgently sought to construct a political tutelage and make long-term plans for the country. Therefore, a reorganization conference was convened to resolve all important issues. People such as Feng Yuxiang, Yan Xishan, Li Zongren, and Li Jishen all attended the meeting. Comrade Chiang frankly and openly expressed at the meeting that as soldiers, they should take principles as the premise and the country as the main body, and that individual positions and rights could be sacrificed. However, Feng, Yan, Li, and others fundamentally failed to understand the Party's principles. Once their individual positions were consolidated, they reverted to the original face of warlords and exposed their counter-revolutionary hearts. They believed that the reorganization implementation plan was in great conflict with feudalism and did everything possible to obstruct it at the meeting and in private conversations, making incomprehensible reasons and expressing untraceable arguments in the hope of dispelling this move. Although Wu Zhihui, He Jingzhi, and other comrades, as well as the chairman, delivered generous speeches, admonishing them with great righteousness and tirelessly imploring them, they were ultimately unable to suppress their ambitions and dispel their suspicions. As a result, this important conference that was watched by people at home and abroad not only achieved nothing but also harbored the motives for rebellion. After returning to their territories, they plotted to rebel. Comrade Chiang still treated them with calmness and forbearance, hoping to use the power of influence to eliminate them invisibly. However, by the time the Third Plenary Session opened, their rebellious actions and evidence were completely revealed. At this time, even if he wanted to appease them again, it was impossible. The north and the south are both territories of the Republic of China, and there is originally no boundary. Although our Party has a plan to develop the Northwest, it is only to seek welfare for the Northwest and not to invade the Northwest. However, they have falsely claimed that the South wants to conquer the North to incite the views of the people in the North and achieve their desire to use force and make trouble. We can only take justice as our yardstick and rely on spirit to subdue them. The villains who harm the country and the people can eventually be eliminated within a time limit, and the great revolutionary cause can be completed. After the report, the meeting adjourned at 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>▲ The National Government held a memorial ceremony for the fourth anniversary of the Northern Expedition Oath-Taking at the National Government Hall at 10:00 AM on the 9th. Attendees included Hu Hanmin, Dai Jitao, Gu Yingfen, Wang Chonghui, Lin Sen, Zeng Yangfu, Yi Peiji, Wu Siyu, Sun Bowen, Wang Zhengting, Zhang Nanxian, Zheng Hongnian, Lin Xiang, Chen Shaokuan, Niu Yongjian, Jiang Menglin, Wei Daoming, Chen Yi, Wang Boqun, Ma Fuxiang, Li Jinlun, Chen Yu, Qin Hua, and representatives from various agencies and bureaus, as well as 400 staff members from the National Government's civil affairs and military affairs departments. Chairman Hu Hanmin performed the ceremony and read the General's will. Chairman Hu Hanmin then delivered a speech, stating that today is the anniversary of the Northern Expedition Oath-Taking in Guangdong four years ago. At that time, the internal affairs of Guangdong had been completely reorganized, and the Southern warlords had also been gradually eliminated. The comrades of the Party believed that in order to achieve the revolutionary goals, it was necessary to unify the country first. If this were not done, it would not be possible to achieve internal and external goals. Therefore, in the 15th year of the Republic, the Party decided to launch the Northern Expedition and appointed Comrade Chiang as the Commander-in-Chief. Comrade Chiang took the oath of the army in Guangdong on this day four years ago. At that time, Comrade Wu Zhihui represented the Central Committee in awarding the flag and respectfully handed over the General's portrait to Comrade Chiang, taking the meaning of carrying a wooden tablet to set out on the expedition. At that time, Comrades Tan Yankai and Zhu Peide were extremely obedient to Comrade Chiang's appointment as Commander-in-Chief and recognized that the responsibility was heavy, deeply feeling that no one but Comrade Chiang could shoulder this great responsibility. This pure and unselfish mentality can be a model for ordinary comrades. In addition, when the Party launched the Northern Expedition, outsiders who did not understand the truth had many misunderstandings about the words "Northern Expedition." They did not know that the Party's Northern Expedition was not a conquest of a certain place, but aimed to eliminate the warlords, liberate the people from suffering, and enable the Chinese nation to restore independence and freedom. It was entirely a battle between those with and without principles. The recent disturbances in Hunan by the Zhang and Gui rebels have been eliminated by the Central Government, and the Shi Yusan Department has also been almost wiped out. This kind of reversal is caused by a lack of understanding of the principles. The government has initially tolerated these groups in many ways, and only when they become intolerable does it send troops to suppress them. The government's painstaking efforts are entirely for the people, so it will never resort to force unless it is absolutely necessary. As for those who are fickle and cannot recognize the principles, they certainly cannot survive. This can be asserted. Next, Dai Jitao gave a speech, stating that today is the anniversary of the Northern Expedition Oath-Taking. Chairman Hu has explained the significance of the Northern Expedition clearly, so there is no need to repeat it. The Northern Expedition was launched after the Eastern Expedition. The significance of the Eastern Expedition was to eliminate the rebels in Dongjiang and Chen Jiongming's remnants in the Hailufeng area. The significance of the Northern Expedition was to eliminate the enemies and remove the obstacles to the north of the current location. Being able to understand the significance of the Eastern Expedition means being able to understand the significance of the Northern Expedition and avoid misunderstandings. Since ancient times in China, the thoughts and ambitions of the Chinese people, through thousands of years of unremitting efforts, have been nothing more than to achieve universal harmony. What is the difference between governance and chaos? Those who destroy unity, practice hegemony, and engage in warlord reaction cause chaos in the country. Being able to eliminate those who destroy unity will lead to the rule of universal harmony. Unifying the country is governance. The purpose of the revolution is to restore national independence and national unification. The purpose is not only to seek national independence and national unification, but also to achieve universal harmony. Therefore, no revolutionary has a concept of east, west, north, and south in China. Having this concept will inevitably lead to division and contention, and the country will be chaotic. Therefore, under the guidance of the General, the National Revolutionary Army has worked hard. Unfortunately, unity has only been achieved recently, and it has been re-instigated by warlords. Therefore, everyone should stand under the banner of revolution and seek to achieve unity. I firmly believe that if we seek the unification of China with the Three Principles of the People, we will succeed. But the revolutionary task in the future is to develop towards the north and to save the most suffering people in China. Among the provinces, the most suffering are the northerners, whose lives are uncomfortable and transportation is inconvenient. Although they are diligent and thrifty, they cannot find work and value. Therefore, we should find ways to help them so that they can enjoy the benefits of civilization and their labor can have a corresponding value. Therefore, in today's commemoration of the Northern Expedition Oath-Taking, all the comrades of the Party and all the people of the government should unite as one, with the rear supporting the front, and prepare for the great plan of construction. After the speech, the meeting adjourned for photography.</p>
<p>▲ The Capital's various circles held a memorial for the Northern Expedition Oath-Taking at the Martyrs' Shrine in the First Park at 9:00 AM on the 9th. Attendees included representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters, various District Party Headquarters, District Sub-Headquarters, and all departments, ministries, and commissions below the National Government, various people's organizations, and various schools, as well as Shi Weihuan, Lou Tongsun, Hong Ludong, Fang Wenzheng, Zhan Keyu, Chen Haicheng, and Wei Youmeng, totaling over 200 people. Chairman Shi Weihuan performed the ceremony as usual. The chairman then gave an opening speech, stating that four years ago, the Party took the oath of the army in Guangzhou, and the revolutionary atmosphere in the country suddenly became tense. The revolutionary spirit also filled the country. At the same time, international oppression and domestic traitors resisted fiercely. However, the comrades of the Party, in order to fulfill the responsibility of saving the country and the people and obeying the General's teachings, ignored everything and swore to launch the Northern Expedition. After the Northern Expedition began, the Three Principles of the People were instilled in the people in the occupied areas in order to establish a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. Also, at that time, a small number of troops defeated the troops of a large number of warlords. The people sacrificed greatly, and the sacrifices of the martyrs were even greater. How should we encourage ourselves in today's commemoration of the Northern Expedition Oath-Taking? We must work tirelessly. Now that unification is almost complete, unfortunately, Yan and Feng have suddenly rebelled again. In recent months, the war has become increasingly tense. Revolutionary comrades are working hard to kill the enemy in the Yellow River basin, sweating profusely and disregarding life and death. We in the rear should work harder to find ways to comfort the soldiers at the front. Next, Wei Youmeng, representative of the Central Military Academy, reported on the war situation at the front, stating that the Central Army has changed to the method of surrounding the regiment in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. The front line of the Pinghan Line is now thirty miles away from Kaifeng. Then, Lou Tongsun and others delivered speeches, and at the end, they shouted slogans and took photos before dismissing the meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Important News from Anhui Province on Bandit Suppression <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Second Cavalry Division Defeats Bandits in Chuxian County</p>
<p>▲ The Independent Brigade Recovers Territory in Huoshan County</p>
<p>The notorious bandit Jiang Guochang (nicknamed Three Legs) in northern Anhui has been harassing various counties for more than ten years. Recently, he gathered more than 900 people and rampaged through Chuxian County, burning, killing, raping, and looting, claiming to be the commander of the New Wu Army Corps and hoping to launch a major offensive. The Central Government specially ordered Zhang Lisheng, the commander of the cavalry group stationed in Bengbu, to send troops to suppress him.</p>
<p>After receiving the order, Zhang immediately ordered Ge Wucheng, the commander of the Third Brigade of the Second Cavalry Division, to dispatch the Seventh Cavalry Regiment and the First Infantry Regiment from Zhangbaling, Shaheji, and other places to encircle and suppress the bandits. Contact was made with the bandits at Qilinshangma Place, and thirty bandits were injured on the spot, and dozens of hostages and livestock were seized. The bandit fled northeast from Daishan Zhen to Lao Jiashan, intending to resist desperately. The government troops set out from Yishanji and pursued the bandits towards Zilaiqiao, Guimuzhou, and Gengying. At the same time, the Lai'an police corps was blocking the bandits at Xishankou and fighting against them. When the Seventh Cavalry Regiment arrived at the south mountain of Gengying, the bandits stubbornly resisted again, using submachine guns to charge, but were all repelled. The pseudo-battalion commander Cheng Bingwen was killed on the spot, and dozens of bandits were injured. Zhang Lisheng believed that the bandits were unpredictable and could not be wiped out without a thorough and painful suppression. A few days ago, he went to Chu by car with Chief of Staff Sun Baoyu, Staff Officer Mo Jinlong, and Secretary Zhang Xiaochen to supervise the suppression, and also dispatched mortar and machine gun companies to cooperate with the cavalry and infantry units, and mobilized the police corps of Lai'an, Dingyuan, Tianchang, and Liuhe counties in Jiangsu to encircle and suppress the bandits in various ways. More than 150 bandits were killed in Gaoshanji and other places, and countless bandits were injured. Dozens of male and female hostages were seized. On the government side, Liu Dianlin, the major company commander of the Seventh Cavalry Regiment, and several soldiers were killed in battle. Ten platoon leaders and one soldier from the Lai'an County police team were killed in battle. After the bandits were severely suppressed, they dispersed in four directions and were in a very embarrassed situation. The two counties of Chu and Lai are no longer worried. In addition to continuing to send troops to pursue the bandits, Zhang has also telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government and Wei Lihuang, the commander of the Anhui Northern Clear Countryside, to discuss handling the clear countryside to clear the source of the bandits.</p>
<p>Huoshan County was occupied by bandits (as reported in previous newspapers, it was recovered on the 1st of this month by the Third Regiment of Pan Shanzhai's Fifth Independent Brigade). The brigade recently telegraphed the three counties of He, Shou, and Liu to report their victory, the original text of which is as follows: Our brigade sent five battalions of troops, led by Pan Shousan, the commander of the Third Regiment, to pursue and suppress the bandits in the Sanjianpu, Xia Fuqiao, and Huoshan County area, along with the local militia. The attack on the bandits, who numbered thousands, began at Qingshan. Our officers and soldiers were exceptionally brave, and the bandits retreated steadily. We successively occupied Sanjianpu, Xia Fuqiao, Hao Yuanling, Zhou Dun, Shujiamiao, and other places, and pursued them fiercely to the Dahe Factory area, where the fighting was particularly fierce. The bandits collapsed and fought to fall into the water and drowned, with hundreds of people killed. The brave team was selected to capture the mountains east of Xiangzishi. The bandits collapsed towards Huocheng, and our army took advantage of the victory to pursue them, and recovered Huoshan County at 6:00 PM on the east afternoon, and continued to advance in separate routes to suppress the bandits in Heishidu, Longmenchong, Dushan, and Mabou.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Hubei Provincial Government Allocates Huge Sum for Dyke Repair <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>▲ The province's dykes and embankments are divided into twenty sections</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou reports that the river water has risen early this summer and its momentum is very strong, which is rare in recent years. According to Fang Dazhi, Director of the Yongli Bureau of the Provincial Government, the current situation of active flood prevention is roughly as follows: "Currently, it is the summer flood season and the river water has risen sharply. After dispatching personnel to investigate, the Fankou Dyke sluice gate was found to be dilapidated due to years of disrepair and was breached by the water. The Bureau immediately allocated tens of thousands of yuan to the Dyke Engineering Bureau and ordered them to repair it day and night within a limited time to prevent further collapse. In addition, it was heard that the Sunjia Guai people's dyke in Jinjiang was dug open by the communists, causing the river water to rush in, but no formal report has been received. Personnel have been dispatched to investigate. Whether the river dyke works in the province are solid is of great importance to the people's livelihood. In the past, due to the lack of organization in the employment of dyke workers, malpractices developed and turned into opportunities for corruption and unscrupulous elements to make money. Now, personnel have been sent to repair each dyke. There is no time for further changes. Before the completion of the repair period, many are still unfinished. Therefore, the flood prevention work for this year has been carried out in advance to provide relief. The province's dykes and embankments have been divided into twenty sections, each section is equipped with a flood prevention director who is responsible for paying attention to the dangers and properly arranging protection. At the same time, the previous repair projects will be inspected and reported truthfully, and estimates will be made for the planned repair projects and the required project costs. Based on the past practice of the province sending special commissioners to survey and estimate, the flood prevention funds for this year have also been approved by the provincial government to be allocated 150,000 yuan for application. If it is insufficient in the future, it shall be submitted for additional requests based on the facts. All of the flood prevention directors employed this year are selected from graduates of engineering schools who have rich dyke construction experience to eliminate the dyke worms. Perhaps the accumulated malpractices of the past can be completely eradicated." In addition, Fang issued a circular attached below to stress this year's flood prevention work. [The case follows the Jiangxiang various main dykes. The flood prevention work for this year has been planned into sections and flood prevention directors have been assigned separately. They should immediately lead all levels of staff to the site to carry out the work within a time limit. All of the planning and protection matters should be fully responsible by the directors of each section. It is especially important to rely on the full cooperation and diligent work of all staff to ensure safety. Moreover, the river water has risen early this year and many dyke works are still unfinished. Detailed inspections, attention to dangers, and proper protection are all necessary. It is now found that most of the flood prevention personnel in various places have reported to their posts in compliance with the order, but there are still many who are watching and delaying in the province. They are ignoring their duties and are very unworthy of their appointments. In addition to ordering them separately, the director should immediately follow the investigation and report any staff members who have not reported to their posts before the 10th of this month to be dismissed and replaced. Do not conceal anything. This order is of utmost importance.] (6th)</p>

<p>million yuan. The Executive Headquarters Director He Yingqin advocated strict handling and ordered the Executive Headquarters Aide-de-Camp and Military Law Departments, the Hubei Provincial Government, the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, the Hubei Finance Special Commissioner's Office, and the Special Tax Supervision Committee to organize a review committee to conduct a strict review. The committee was established on June 14 and has held five review meetings and two temporary meetings, collecting evidence very seriously. When the Xiang Incident occurred, Director He went to Hunan to supervise the troops. He recently sent a telegram from Hunan to Hankou ordering the confiscation of the smuggled earth and ordering the review committee to expedite the review and conclude it. The Executive Headquarters received the telegram and convened various departments to organize a sales committee to conduct a public auction. The review committee held a joint meeting on the 5th and decided to conclude the case as soon as possible, roughly within a week. The main criminals in this case are active-duty soldiers Yang Xiaoxuan and Liu Fuqing. When the Yuchuan Steamer arrived in Hankou, they fled by steamer. Shen Gong Lishi, the Director of the Special Tax Office of Hubei and Hunan, who was suspected of malfeasance, was also dismissed by the Hubei Finance Special Commissioner's Office, and representatives of the Special Tax Office, Zhang Ziqin and Ma Zhaolong, were prepared to be interrogated by the review committee. The original 316 boxes of earth are still being kept under seal by officers designated by the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters. According to Ye Peng, Chief of Staff of the Garrison Headquarters, Commander Xia Douyin had repeatedly ordered a strict investigation of soldiers harboring private smuggling of opium. After this case was cracked, Commander Xia was extremely angry and immediately reported to the Executive Headquarters for legal action. He was subsequently ordered to properly preserve the smuggled earth and send personnel to participate in the review committee. In addition, the Garrison Headquarters did not interfere. The review committee is responsible and someone will be able to fairly handle the matter in the shortest possible time. The Garrison Headquarters is responsible for maintaining the public order in Wuhan and has the duty to strictly investigate soldiers harboring private smuggling of earth. It will continue to fulfill its duties and strictly investigate and arrest those involved so that no one escapes. (July 6)</p>
<h3 id="e46">Chen Guohui's Wanted Order Revoked <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>▲ Fang Shengtao Arrives in Xiamen with Plans for the Fujian Situation</p>
<p>A dispatch from Xiamen reports that Hui was originally a bandit army. When it entered Fujian, it was incorporated into the newly compiled army and then transferred to Longyan to be reorganized into the First Mixed Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army. Last year, the provincial government felt that the incorporated army had not changed its old ways and decided to thoroughly suppress it. Gu Chen's was the most powerful bandit team with ties to outside forces. At that time, the Provincial Chairman Yang Shuzhuang personally came to Xiamen to supervise the suppression of Chen in Tong'an. Chen escaped with his troops to Anxi and occupied Anxi, Yongchun, and Nan'an. The provincial government then reported to the National Government and ordered the arrest of Chen and dozens of others including Ye Dingguo. The provincial committee Lin Zhiyuan supervised the education regiment and repeatedly suppressed them, but failed due to the treacherous mountain roads. Before long, the Fujian situation changed and the military suppression of bandits in southern Fujian completely stopped. Chen supplemented his strength in the Anyong area and became stronger. Recently, the provincial government approved the request of the Fujianese fellow villagers in Shanghai and telegraphed the central government to revoke the wanted order. The National Government has approved it and the provincial government ordered the order to be forwarded to all places. [The National Government Civil Affairs Office telegraphed the order. According to the Fujian Provincial Government's telegram, the Fujianese fellow villagers association in Shanghai stated that Chen Guohui's brigade has been stationed in Anxi, Nan'an, Yongchun and other counties for several months since being pursued by your government and has been able to protect the local people. Recently, they have received messages from various townships stating that since the provincial changes, communist bandits in southern Fujian have taken the opportunity to rise up and people are in great fear. Fortunately, Chen's brigade has been suppressing them and can temporarily alleviate the current situation. However, they fear that if there is no proper solution, the local people will be in an unbearable situation if a change occurs. After careful consideration, the members of the association have earnestly requested your government to approve the revocation of the arrest warrant for the former brigade commander Chen Guohui and Chief of Staff Hong Wende, restore their original positions to test their future achievements and reassure the people. The local future will be greatly benefited and the provincial situation can also be slightly improved. It is reported that bandits and communists are rampant in southern Fujian. The telegram states that Chen Guohui and others, who were born in southern Fujian, should be able to protect the local people. It is proposed to revoke the arrest warrant for Chen Guohui and Hong Wende to give them a chance to rehabilitate themselves and contribute to the Fujian situation. Please investigate and follow the instructions. It is ordered that the order be followed and distributed to all subordinates to inform them of this order.</p>
<p>After the National Government issued the order, Fang Shengtao arrived in Xiamen from Shanghai on June 27. Hong Wende came with him. According to Hong, Chen's revocation of the wanted order and restoration to his original position means his troops now have 4,000 soldiers. It is also said that Fang's arrival in Xiamen was prompted by Fujian Chairman Yang Shuzhuang and various important figures in the central government to clean up the Fujian situation. Fang plans to first eliminate Lu Xingbang in northern Fujian. A brigade will be drawn from the newly compiled division, and all six battalions of the training corps, about 2,600 to 2,700 people, will be combined with Chen Guohui's troops and led by Fang from Yongchun through Dehua to attack Youxi from the side. Youxi is the base of Lu's troops. After Youxi is captured, Yanping will also not be able to hold. Combined with Liu Heding's frontal attack, it will not be difficult to eliminate Lu in one fell swoop. Zhang Zhen has arrived in Xiamen from Zhangzhou on the 29th to meet with Fang and discuss strategy. (4th)</p>

<p>▲ The Hangzhou Municipal Rice Stabilization Bureau is divided into five branches. Due to the shortage of rice and the upcoming harvest of new grain, General Manager Shen of the Three Warehouses is discussing with the board of directors to limit the rice sales of each branch. However, the Changqingsi branch has more poor households and still needs 25 shi per day. The original four-month term is planned to be ended early.</p>
<p>▲ The Hangzhou Power Plant has decided to build a new plant at Chankou to develop the latest electric steam business. The huge cost has been agreed upon with the Chinese Local Industry, Transportation, Agriculture, and Industry Banks to borrow 1.5 million yuan in overdraft and use public debt with a face value of 1.98 million yuan as collateral, and repay the principal and interest by June of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. The case has been approved by the Provincial Government Committee and is now being requested by the Finance and Construction Departments for guarantee and the Zhejiang Power Bureau Commerce and Trade Association for witness.</p>
<p>▲ The Hangzhou Municipal Merchants Organization Unification Committee held its ninth committee meeting yesterday afternoon and passed the following resolutions: 1) The Hangzhou Power Plant's application to the banking group for an overdraft loan is requested to be witnessed. 2) Nine people including Wang Wuquan are appointed as registration officers for the silk weaving industry. 3) Seven people including Yang Yuzhen are appointed as registration officers for the printing industry. 4) Nine people including Chen Xingwu are appointed as registration officers for the medical industry. 5) Seven people including Zheng Xijun are appointed as registration officers for the rickshaw industry. 6) Nine people including Ying Jianqing are appointed as registration officers for the Chinese medicine industry. 7) Nine people including Fang Jixiang are appointed as registration officers for the southern goods industry.</p>
<p>▲ The Zhejiang Provincial Merchants Organization Unification Committee sent a circular to the Municipal Commerce and Trade Association and the chambers of commerce of various counties, stating that Committee Member Xu Zhen suggested that the membership registration of this association should be based on the spirit of Article 1 of the Chamber of Commerce Law, which aims to promote the development of industry, commerce, and foreign trade and increase the public welfare of industry and commerce, and should be limited to national commerce. Therefore, all factories, companies, and shops, foreign firms, and their distribution offices, management offices, or branches run by foreigners should not be allowed to register and serve as members of the chamber of commerce. Please make a public decision on whether this is appropriate. The third committee meeting of this association resolved that all those who simply manage foreign businesses or foreign capital operating in the interior should be temporarily refused registration by the commerce and trade associations of various counties and cities, and should be submitted to the provincial party headquarters for referral to the central party headquarters for regulations so that there can be a basis to follow and be cautious. Record the minutes and send them to the provincial party headquarters. Please inform your association to inform the subordinate merchant groups, etc.</p>

Du Cheng, the interrogator, opened the court at 9:00 pm and interrogated Gu. The bandit's confession was very impressive. He admitted to the riot, arson, and murder. He was appointed as the pseudo-captain and the fundraising director, and kidnapping for ransom was used as a means of fundraising. He did not know how many people were kidnapped, and he could not remember how many people were killed. Then, the interrogating official summoned the family members of the victims to testify. Some pointed to Gu for killing their brothers, and some pointed to Gu for killing their father and wife. He nodded silently, his demeanor self-possessed. Next, Sun Youtang, or Xiao Pixiu, was interrogated. He admitted to more than 20 kidnappings.

<p>The Lu Kidnapping Case Solved in Shanghai A farmer named Lu Caigen, deceased, from the western half of the sixteenth map of Henan, Zhuangxing, had his nine-year-old posthumous son Zihe kidnapped. The ransom price was reduced from 20,000 to 5,000 yuan. It is reported that the bandits sent another letter two days ago threatening to tear up the ticket if the ransom was not paid in two days. Therefore, Lu's mother and her nephew went to Shanghai as scheduled yesterday to negotiate with the bandits. While they were discussing the ransom price, a member of the Zhabei Security Corps of the Shanghai Special City, surnamed Mao (from Shaoxing, formerly a security official in Zhuangxing), came to Zhuang to report that two unknown men and women had rented a front building ten days ago and acted very secretively, especially monitoring the child, which raised suspicion. Yesterday morning (7th), they took the opportunity to inquire about the child, who initially claimed to be surnamed Chen. After further investigation, he revealed that he was from the Lu family in Zhuangxing. At the same time, newspapers carried similar reports of the kidnapping of the Lu child in Zhuangxing. Fearing a misunderstanding, they came to inquire. Yang Xingsheng, the leader of the second patrol of the Zhuang garrison, verified the previous situation and found it to be accurate. Therefore, he consulted with Lu Ziyun, the clan leader of the Lu family, Shi Jinxiang, the local security guard, and led two squad leaders to Shanghai by boat last night. It is reported that the patrol leader sent someone back to report that Yang and others arrived in Shanghai this morning (8th). First, the plaintiff Lu Ziyun and the contact Mao went to a Mao's house in the American Concession of Zhabei. They looked at the bandit den on the upper floor and saw the kidnapped son being accompanied by a bandit woman. The patrol leader Yang immediately wrote a report in the name of the plaintiff Lu Ziyun and his close relatives Chen Boyi and the local security guard Shi Jinxiang, requesting the local police station to arrest them. At the same time, Mao went to the Security Corps headquarters and went to the place by car with the police station at 8:30 to surround the place. The two male and female bandits had not yet gotten up and were all captured. The Lu hostage was also rescued by Lu Ziyun, who went with them, at the risk of his life. The remaining accomplices confessed that they were living in the Jiangsu Hotel at 117 Wuma Road for the purpose of negotiating the ransom. The police station, fearing that they would escape upon hearing the news, immediately sent four people by car to</p>

<p>Failure to Mediate Labor Dispute in Silk Factories: The labor and management of local silk factories have been in dispute over a contract for a long time, and neither side is willing to compromise, leading to extreme positions. Zhang Hentian, the Standing Committee Member of the County Party Headquarters and the Civil Training Committee, convened a meeting of both parties yesterday afternoon to mediate. It is understood that the Silk Factory Trade Association (the employer side) failed to nominate representatives due to the insufficient number of attendees at repeated meetings. They specially reported the above situation to Zhang, the Standing Committee Member of the Civil Training Committee, who declared that this was the reason why yesterday's mediation failed and needed to be postponed for resolution.</p>
<p>City Property Management Committee Finalized: After the Wuxi Municipal Preparatory Office was ordered to be abolished, a City Property Management Committee was organized to manage the city-owned funds and properties.

<p>Rampant Banditry in the Western Suburbs: At midnight on the 4th, during a heavy rain, eight or nine people suddenly sought shelter from the rain at several houses near Wu Sandagezi's place, west of the West Gate's parade ground. After the rain stopped, they took out concealed weapons, tied up Wu Sandagezi and five neighbors. In Guayuan, two miles from the city, a man named Wu San was robbed by a dozen bandits on the night of the 5th, who took his belongings and kidnapped his son-in-law. In Cuijiayuan, near the suburbs, Zhang Guangyu had previously been forced by bandits to pay 200 yuan. Yesterday, more than twenty bandits came again, and the family members escaped through the back door. The bandits then looted all his grain and took his housekeeper. Also, at Cao Changsong's house, four miles from the city, more than ten bandits came after the heavy rain on the night of the 5th, kidnapped Cao's youngest grandson, and went to Cao's widow's house, kidnapping her ten-year-old orphaned son and his nephew.</p>
<p>Informant Also Killed by Bandits: Xie Yuangfu, a farmer from Xiejia Garden in Motou, had previously served the bandits by running errands.

<p>Xintan Prepares to Launch Price Stabilization: The Xintan District Office, the Public Security Bureau, and the District Property Committee, in order to prevent the occurrence of famine riots in various places, convened a meeting of rice industry representatives and wealthy households at 2:00 PM on the 4th to discuss price stabilization measures. It was decided that District Chief Xia, Public Security Bureau Chief Wang, District Property Committee Representative Yu Shaonong, Xinxianli Representative Cao Dixian, and Shicheng Temple Representative would be appointed, and Gao Xiaolan and others would be hired to form a price stabilization committee, with the City God Temple as the price stabilization location.</p>
<p>Farmers Also Kidnapped by Bandits: Cai Arong, a farmer in Hengmatou with meager assets, was kidnapped by bandits on the 4th and his whereabouts are unknown. His family is very anxious and is now sending people out to investigate.</p>
<p>Lake Bandit Accomplice Cai Arong Arrested: The 2nd Battalion of the 7th Regiment of the Provincial Security Force stationed in this city received a telegram from the Xincang Public Security Sub-bureau a few days ago that there were more than 50 bandits in the Quan Gongting area. Battalion Commander Zhao immediately dispatched soldiers led by Yuan Geng from the 4th company to suppress them. Upon arriving at Quan Gongting, they saw many people wearing straw hats and white clothes in the teahouse. When they saw the troops arrive, they panicked and fled. The soldiers immediately pursued them and captured bandit leader Cai Arong on the spot. The rest escaped by swimming. They also fired shots from across the bank in an attempt to rescue him. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the soldiers divided up and surrounded them. The bandits, unable to resist, scattered and fled. The soldiers and others then captured four suspicious individuals, including Tang Zhaohe, nearby. They were released on bail after the village committee explained and vouched for them. However, Cai Arong, the bandit leader, was the company commander of Taibao Ashu and was confirmed by various villages in Xincang and Luchuan as an important member of the bandit gang. Therefore, he was escorted to Hangzhou overnight yesterday. After interrogation by the 7th Regiment Commander, he was immediately sent to the Security Office for interrogation.</p>
<p>Ding Site's House Robbed by Bandits: Ding Site, a farmer living about two miles from Yaqian Town, was well-off and had long been coveted by bandits. On the night of the 7th, more than twenty bandits armed with rifles and iron rods stormed into his house. Ding Site was awakened from his sleep and, unable to escape, was tied up and tortured by the bandits, suffering severe injuries. They looted more than 100 silver dollars and gold jewelry, worth about 600-700 gold in total, before leaving with a whoop.</p>

<p>County Government Recovers Local Property Funds: The Great Temple in Linpu Town, Xiaoshan, has more than 3,000 yuan in property income from its houses. Although this public fund is jointly owned by the two counties of Shao and Xiao, it has been embezzled by one or two local gentry under the guise of safekeeping. The Xiaoshan County Government learned that this local public fund could be used for local public welfare. It ordered the Fourth District Chief to investigate and verify the matter. If the custodian is found to have embezzled the funds, the safekeeping will be revoked and the funds will be recovered.</p>

<p>Bloodshed Over Rice on the Niuzhuang Steamer: More than ten people, including Dong Yin Fuxian, the manager of the Taihe Rice Store, Du Lindi, the manager of the Qiantai Rice Store, and Lou Afu, the manager of the Xieshun Rice Store, were unloading rice on the Niuzhuang Steamer at the Taikoo Wharf in Jiangbei at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 7th). Lou Afu wanted to put the rice leaking from the broken bags back into the original bags, but Yan Sisi, the cargo hold manager of the steamer, refused, leading to an argument that escalated into a fight. At one point, Dong Yin Fuxian and Du Beidi from the rice store side, and Chen Huichun, You Asisi, Yao Afa, and Chen Shirenen from the cargo hold side, all joined the melee, using wooden sticks and iron hammers as weapons. The steamer's comprador, Lin Chuan, rushed to mediate, but only managed to separate them after many people had been injured. They went to the Taikoo Foreign Company to reason, and the rice store side felt dissatisfied. They reported the incident to the First Branch of the Second District Police Station, which took all the witnesses to the station for questioning. After unsuccessful persuasion, the station transferred all the people involved in the case, as well as the weapons such as wooden sticks and iron tools, to the court for review.</p>

<h3 id="e61">The Cause and Effect of This Expedition <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Li Huitang, Captain of the Chinese Expeditionary Football Team</p>
<p>"How can I get 100,000 strings of coins to try leading a team to Europe?" Isn't this the hopeful phrase in my Southern Expedition diary last year? Time flies, and in the blink of an eye, another year has passed. Although I haven't been fortunate enough to get 100,000 strings of coins this year, the fantasy of conquering Europe has now become a reality. Not only has the European trip achieved its goal, but it has also expanded. Our itinerary this time also includes Canada and the United States, making it a round-the-world feat.</p>
<p>I've had the worst luck for the past month. From the National Games to the Da Yun, my body, which has always been fond of movement, has been bedridden for more than two months by the ruthless disease demon. Recovering from the illness and then adding foot troubles has prevented me from participating in both the National and Far East Games. Being sick all the time makes me feel extremely ashamed and resentful of fate. Fortunately, everything has recovered recently, but my laziness is several times greater than usual when my spirit has not recovered and my vitality is still weak, especially when I pick up a pen, I always feel that it weighs thousands of pounds. However, the news about this expedition has awakened my lazy muscles. I feel that there are slight discrepancies in the recent reports, especially in the commentary, which contains counter-propaganda and has a destructive effect. At a time when our drums are beating and our army is about to set off, instead of receiving support and encouragement from all walks of life, we are subjected to this kind of undesirable reaction, which makes me feel at a loss. Like a bone stuck in my throat, I can't bear it. Before leaving Hong Kong, I want to tell all walks of life the cause and effect of the expedition.</p>
<p>My trip south this time is actually entirely for personal matters and has no official business or special responsibility. Since there is no special responsibility, there is no talk of success or failure. The disruptors are only intensifying their work, exaggerating the failure of so-and-so, deceiving themselves and others, and causing the incompetent to disturb themselves, which really makes me laugh.</p>
<p>The motivation for conquering Europe dates back to three years ago, but in recent years it has been troubled by various obstacles. Li Silian, a famous referee in Shanghai, returned to the country on leave last year, and took the opportunity to revive the old proposal, and after half a year of preparation, everything gradually fell into place. The dream of the past will soon be staged from illusion to reality. Before I talk about other things, there are three things to be explained here.</p>
<p>(1) Name: The name of this expeditionary force has caused a great problem. People outside suspect that we are easily crowned with the name Lehua because everything is initiated and organized by Lehua. In fact, why do we have such a meaning? However, it is not possible to contact the other party without a formal organization. As for the name of the expedition, we have already decided to use "Chinese Expeditionary Football Team" ChineseAmatureSoccerTeam, because Lehua's scope is narrow and not applicable. We are not so foolish as to abandon the broad and take the narrow.</p>
<p>(2) Amateur and Salaried: This qualification issue has also been the subject of a very important study, but as far as I know now, the players' future income, such as clothing expenses, daily expenses, etc., are all allowed by the amateur world, and the biggest guarantee is that when the team returns home in the future, the accounts of the entire team will be approved by the accountants of the English Football Association. I remember that before and after the Australian Expedition in 1927, there were also unscrupulous elements who wanted to sabotage and add the crime of being salaried to the team members, but the result was a complete failure. The treatment of the members this time is slightly different from that of the Australian Expedition, and the suspicion of being employed does not need to be overemphasized by enthusiastic people.</p>
<p>(3) Java Tour: A few days ago, counter-propagandists said that this expeditionary force is extremely dangerous. You see, their funding is not secured and they still have to raise funds in Southeast Asia. This kind of argument is extremely ridiculous. There are two reasons why we first travel to Java: (1) Because of Lehua's excellent performance in the Southern Expedition last year, the overseas Chinese specifically asked us to revisit it by the way. (2) Because the European season has not yet arrived, we can take this opportunity to practice in Southeast Asia first to study the cooperation of our team. Planning ahead can be called wisdom. Counter-propagandist, you are too nervous.</p>
<p>After the explanation, I want to talk about the benefits and purposes of this expedition.</p>
<p>Whenever a football team goes on an expedition to a foreign land, in addition to gaining the practical benefits of visiting scenery and expanding their knowledge, the most important thing is to promote the country and improve their skills. The failure of our country's government diplomacy in recent years is not something that needs to be translated. Although our sports are also inferior and thousands of miles behind, anyone will agree that the effect of sports representatives going abroad to promote the country is faster and more effective than that of diplomats and great writers. The seeds planted by the two Australian expeditions are now blooming with brilliant flowers and fruits. This time, the team will travel all over Europe and even to Canada and the United States, which will surely refresh foreigners, especially people from small countries, about the psychology of China. As for improving art, it is the first task of the football world in our country today. Just imagine that the achievements of the Chinese in Hong Kong and Shanghai in recent years can be said to be very outstanding, but the recent Far East Games were evenly divided with the Japanese, who are behind us. Although it is said that there are many reasons why we cannot win completely this time, we are stopping the boat in the middle of the stream, staying in the country and sticking to the old ways. Not only is the progress slow, but there is also a danger of not being allowed to retreat. This expedition to countries with excellent skills and many changes during the competition will definitely absorb the strengths of others. It is impossible to calculate the benefits of their future return to the country to instill them.</p>
<p>There is also the question of how to obtain these talents, which is what all walks of life want to know urgently. Our goal is of course to find the most outstanding members, but there are often various unimaginable difficulties that lead to results that do not live up to the original wish. In my personal opinion, if there is nothing too difficult, in order to achieve both public and private benefits, it is worth sacrificing to what extent to join the team. As for the associations, in order to help each other and cultivate talents for the country, they should also look far ahead and try to send as many skilled players as possible to participate so that they can serve the country and benefit the future of the football world when they return to the country. As far as I know now, there are indeed two or three Hong Kong stars who cannot go with us. Recently, the organizers have had to seek the next best thing because, in order to maintain our credibility, we cannot postpone this matter any longer. If we cannot do it with our hands, we will seek the next best thing. If the next best thing cannot be done, we will seek the next best thing, and even if no one responds at all, Zhao Da and Sun Er will almost have to make up a team. The reason is that our purpose is to go abroad to acquire new knowledge, not like the isolated and angry Sheng Riqian said that we must win to be glorious. Moreover, talking about winning or losing loses the true meaning of sports. Therefore, the complete list of the expedition is not complete until we have found good players in Southeast Asia and are about to depart from Singapore. However, judging from the strength of the players who are currently with the team, at the very least, we can give foreigners a good performance and make them satisfied.</p>
<p>Finally, I sincerely hope that we can gain the deepest practical benefits from this expedition, and that it will not disappoint everyone's sacrifices. On the one hand, I sincerely hope that the sports world in the country can learn from the stimulation of this Far East failure, and that they will no longer observe things through a magnifying glass, but should work through a long-range lens to sweep away the evil winds of self-interest for individuals and associations. Everyone should join hands to improve China and seek the future happiness of the sports world. Please, the journey is imminent, and we will talk about it next time.</p>

<p>▲ Sun Daosheng Wins Group A Final</p>
<p>▲ Lu Aibai Wins Group B Final</p>
<p>▲ Cheng Zhenhua Wins Group C Final</p>
<p>▲ Finals for Groups A, B, and C Simultaneously Tomorrow</p>
<p>The All-Shanghai Chinese Handball Singles Competition, hosted by the YMCA, has aroused the interest of the general public. The number of spectators has been increasing day by day, and latercomers have no place to stand. The semi-finals of Groups A, B, and C yesterday were full of wonderful performances. At this critical moment, those who participated were all excited and hoped to win the right to participate in the finals. As a result, Sun Daosheng in Group A, Lu Aibai in Group B, and Cheng Zhenhua in Group C won the victories and jumped into the final scene, competing for the championship with Hong Yuqiu, Hong Rulin, and Luo Shunda respectively. The referees were Zhu Kuan and Gu Yongzhao, and the record keeper was Chen Fuzhang.</p>
<p>▲ Sun Daosheng Defeats Ni Hongen (Group A): Ni's fame soared after defeating the famous general Huang Kesu. Sun, who is known for his experience, did not dare to underestimate the enemy. After the start, Sun's serves were high and fast, making them difficult to return. Sometimes, when the returns were successful, they felt weak and powerless. Sun took advantage of this to launch a killer move and succeeded. Thus, Sun took the lead with a score of 8-2. Ni then increased his score slightly, but the difference between the scores of the two sides was still far. As a result, Sun won the first game with a score of 21-9. In the second game, the two sides were closely matched and it was difficult to distinguish between them. Although Sun's ball skills were better, he lacked energy, so before the score of 11, Ni was able to maintain his balance. Afterwards, Ni plummeted and was unable to defend himself. Sun did not give up and finally won the second game with a score of 21-12, winning the right to participate in the Group A final.</p>
<p>▲ Lu Aibai Defeats Wei Guanghan (Group B): Lu's victory over Wei and winning the right to participate in the Group B final was due to Wei's own fault. In the first game, Lu won with a score of 21-2 with his agile figure and quick hands. It was reasonable. In the second game, the old general Wei was so angry that he used all kinds of tricks to make Lu exhausted. Wei had 20 points while Lu only had 15 points. However, Wei could not get the last point. Seeing Lu's progress step by step, he finally won the second game with a score of 22. If each side had won one game at that time, the outcome of the third game would have been different.</p>
<p>▲ Cheng Zhenhua Defeats Lu Mengsheng (Group C): Cheng's hopes were extremely high in the Group C championship. His skills were so good that he could have achieved good results even if he had participated in Group B. Now he has condescended to Group C, and he should be able to dominate for a while. Yesterday, in the first game, Lu Mengsheng gave Cheng a series of fierce attacks. As a result, Cheng won with a score of 21-15, but he had exhausted his energy. In the second game, Cheng suspended his hands, moving them left and right, high and low, as he pleased. As a result, he won again with a score of 21-10 and won the right to participate in the Group C final.</p>

<p>▲ Plans to Visit Japan for Competition This Fall</p>
<p>(Japan News) The Waseda University Baseball Department has successfully negotiated with the University of Chicago on a visit to Japan for an expedition. The team will take the Nippon Yusen Kaisha's new ship Hikawa Maru and arrive in Yokohama on September 2. They will compete with Waseda, Keio, Meiji and other universities in Tokyo for a total of seven times. This is the fifth time the University of Chicago has visited Japan and has had many years of contact with the Japanese baseball world. They have an excellent record and are well-trained. The general impression is that they are the most well-mannered university team. This visit to Japan is just before the autumn season of the Six University League, so the Japanese are deeply interested in and look forward to the competition between the teams.</p>

<p>Yesterday, amateur tennis competitions were held at the Municipal No. 1 Public Sports Field. There were a total of six matches in the morning and afternoon. The results and the schedule for this afternoon and tomorrow morning are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday's Results</p>
<p>Group | Players (Win/Loss) | Score | Referee</p>
<p>---|---|---|---</p>
<p>Good | Wang Zhikai Defeats Shen Zhiming | 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 | Hou Shangxiong</p>
<p>Law | Guo Qida Defeats Huang Yuanyin | 6-0, 6-0 | Zhang Longhai</p>
<p>Law | Wang Wume Defeats Liu Quanzhou | 6-2, 6-3 | Tang Zhiming</p>
<p>Xiao | Liu Xing Defeats Hu Ruishen | 6-0, 6-4 | Tang Zhiming</p>
<p>Fang | Jiang Tianpeng Defeats Hu Huaqin | 6-4, 6-2 | Zhang Longhai</p>
<p>Xiao | Wang Keyong Defeats Xu Wenlan | 6-4, 6-3 | Sun Fuxin</p>
<p>The match between Jiang Tianpeng and Hu Huaqin can be called one of the most evenly matched scenes in the competition. The balls hit by both players were all stable and balanced. Although there were no surprising or amazing moves, there were also no unexpected mistakes. Therefore, it was common for the felt ball to cross the net more than ten times before a point was decided. In the first game, the two players each won half of the first eight sets. Afterwards, Jiang won two sets in a row, taking the lead and winning the game. In the second game, Hu's spirit was slightly fatigued and he lost five sets in a row. Although he rallied and recovered two sets, it was already too late.</p>
<p>▲ Schedule for This Afternoon and Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>Group | Time | Match | Field</p>

The team's athletes did not leave the school during the summer vacation and held a friendly match with the school's summer team at Tongji University last night (the 8th at 8:00 PM). When the silver horn sounded, both sides gave their all. Zhonggong's He Yanzhang had a free throw opportunity and connected two points, taking the lead with a score of 4-0. Tongji's Hu Zhiyuan and Zhang Meiran and others quickly caught up and were very active, scoring many points. Zhonggong's center Chen Baoqiu and right guard Guo Zhihong tried their best, but still lost with a score of 33 to 23.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education has stipulated methods for university entrance preliminary examinations for graduates of unregistered private senior high schools. In addition to a public notice, a telegram was sent via express mail to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities stating that a considerable number of private senior high schools or equivalent institutions in various regions have not yet been approved for registration, and the number of their graduates is also substantial. The Ministry has now specially stipulated these preliminary examination methods for these graduates and issued a public notice for general information. A copy of Public Notice No. 13 is hereby issued, along with the principles of the preliminary examination regulations, instructing the relevant "departments" and "bureaus" to immediately comply with the instructions, formulate examination regulations, conduct examinations, and report the implementation details to the Ministry of Education. (With the official seal of Geng) Enclosed are Public Notice No. 13 and the principles of the preliminary examination regulations for graduates of unregistered private senior high schools, as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Ministry of Education Public Notice No. 13</p>
<p>It has been clearly stipulated by the Ministry that the enrollment of new students by public and registered private colleges and universities shall be limited to graduates of public or registered private senior high schools or equivalent institutions. However, recent investigations have revealed that a considerable number of private senior high schools in various regions have not yet been approved for registration, and the number of their graduates is also substantial. While it is true that many of these students are academically poor and difficult to cultivate, there are also those who are academically excellent and comparable to graduates of public or registered private senior high schools. If strict measures are taken to uniformly deny them the opportunity to further their education, it would seem that these students would be deprived of the opportunity for advanced studies, which is not in line with the fundamental purpose of the state and education in nurturing talent. Therefore, the Ministry has now specially stipulated methods for the admission of graduates of unregistered private senior high schools or equivalent institutions. First, the education authorities of each province and city shall conduct examinations, and those who pass shall be issued a certificate of admission to universities, allowing them to apply to public or registered private colleges and universities. Those who fail shall be given a certificate of transfer to a lower grade, according to their academic level. These preliminary university entrance examinations for graduates of unregistered senior high schools shall be limited to those taking place before August 31st of this year. The examination methods shall be formulated by the Ministry in accordance with the principles outlined below, and the education authorities of each province and city shall be instructed to comply with these principles and formulate their own regulations based on local conditions, in order to facilitate implementation. This is hereby announced.</p>
<p>▲ Principles of the Preliminary Examination Regulations for Graduates of Unregistered Private Senior High Schools</p>
<p>(1) An examination committee shall be established, consisting of one chairperson and six to ten members.</p>
<p>(2) The head of the provincial or municipal education authority shall be the ex officio chairperson. The members shall be appointed or employed by the provincial or municipal education authority from among current education administrators and current principals and teachers of public or registered private high schools or higher institutions. However, the number of administrative personnel shall not exceed one-third of the number of principals and teachers.</p>
<p>(3) The examination subjects shall be based on the curriculum of public senior high schools or equivalent institutions.</p>
<p>(4) The examination shall be held in the location of the provincial or municipal government.</p>
<p>(5) Those who pass the examination shall be issued a certificate of admission to universities. Those who fail shall be given a certificate of transfer to a lower grade, according to their academic level.</p>
<p>The aforementioned certificate of admission to universities shall state that "This certificate is for university admission purposes only and shall not be used for proving other qualifications." The same applies to the certificate of transfer.</p>
<p>(6) Graduates of vocational schools that accept junior high school graduates and provide three years of education shall be allowed to register for the examination.</p>

<p>[PRunning Summer Schools for Social Education&gt;</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial People's Education Institute and the Labor-Agriculture College, in order to improve the methods of implementing social education and promote its smooth implementation, are holding a summer school for social education within four weeks from the 11th of this month to the 9th of August.

<p>▲ Jia Shiyi and Zhang Fuyun Both Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday to Assist</p>
<p>▲ Application to the Central Government for Approval of Special Consumption Names</p>
<p>▲ The Issue of Personnel Collecting Taxes in Various Provinces to be Proposed Separately for Discussion</p>
<p>The National Likin Abolition Conference is scheduled to be held in Shanghai on August 15th. Four preparatory meetings have been convened successively, and representatives and proposals from various provinces have been sent or telegraphed en route. Li Hongji, who is in charge of the Likin abolition, believes that with only one month remaining until the conference, the preparation and organization of various matters cannot be delayed. He specially telegraphed Jia Shiyi, Director of the Tax Division of the Ministry of Finance, and Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Customs Administration, urging them to come to Shanghai to assist in the handling of the matter so that they can take office as soon as possible and avoid postponing the conference. Jia and others received the telegram and arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday. According to financial circles, whether the national tax replacement after the implementation of Likin abolition will follow the 1928 Five Provinces Likin Abolition Conference plan and be named Special Consumption Tax has not yet been decided and is still awaiting deliberation at the conference for submission to the Central Government for approval. As for the rate of extraction based on the types and value of goods, due to frequent disasters and poor harvests this year, the conference will consider the local conditions and the price and quality of goods, and even within luxury goods, will determine several levels and decide on the high or low ad valorem tax rate, which must also adapt to the social conditions in various places to avoid the disadvantages of excess. In addition, the issue of personnel from the collection agencies of various provinces will be raised separately for discussion at this conference and will be strictly rectified, it is said.</p>
<p>Xu Jiqing</p>
<h3 id="e74">Resolutely Resigning as Chairman of the City Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>▲ Executive Committee Meeting to be Held Today to Discuss</p>
<p>After Xu Jiqing was elected as the new chairman of the City Chamber of Commerce, he has repeatedly submitted his resignation to the City Chamber of Commerce. The details have been reported previously. Yesterday, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited Xu at the Zhejiang Industrial Bank. According to his statement, he firmly refuses to take office, and said that if the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce is not re-elected for one day, he will not go to the meeting to work. It can be seen from his tone that he must resign. Here are two letters from the four standing committee members of the City Chamber of Commerce to Xu, which also show Xu's firm intention to resign.</p>
<p>▲ Letter from Ye Huijun and Others to Xu Mr. Ye Huijun, Shi Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Yuan Ludeng and others wrote to Mr. Xu (abridged above): Huijun and others have been entrusted by the Executive Committee to temporarily act as chairman, which is not convenient for the long term. Please come to the meeting to take office before the eighth day, otherwise Huijun and others will have to resign from their acting positions to the Executive Committee. Please convene an Executive Committee meeting immediately to resolve everything (abridged below).</p>
<p>▲ Xu Jiqing's Reply Letter After receiving the letter, Xu Jiqing immediately replied in a letter (abridged above): I am afraid and have nowhere to go after being repeatedly urged in your instructions. I have repeatedly stated to you separately, and I am grateful for your understanding. Please convene another meeting of the Executive Committee in the name of acting chairman or standing committee member to elect a wise and capable person to maintain the affairs of the meeting. The reason why I dare not take the position of chairman is not out of humility, but because it is impossible to carry Mount Tai across the North Sea. After the re-election, the chairman will come to the meeting to take the position of standing committee member and apologize to you (abridged below).</p>
<p>▲ Executive Committee Meeting Today Although various parties have tried to retain Xu Jiqing after his firm resignation and refusal to take office, all have failed. The association has specially scheduled a meeting of all Executive Committee members at 1:00 pm today to discuss solutions. I think the result will definitely be resolved.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Chinese Telephone Users Strive for Sovereignty <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>▲ Telegram to the Central Government</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Users Association of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, the National Government, and the Ministry of Interior of the National Government: We have investigated that the telephone and telegraph industry in our country is clearly stipulated to be state-owned. However, this time, the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation purchased the assets of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company without the approval of our government and disregarded our national sovereignty by not obtaining an exclusive franchise from our government. Although our government has repeatedly protested and the public has opposed it, the company has ignored it and acted recklessly. The members of the association are users of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company and feel it is their duty to not remain silent. Therefore, on June 27, the Chinese Users Association of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company was established, and Li Zuyu, Hua Huizhong, Zhu Yinjiang, Cheng Zhusun, Tao Leqin, Jin Runxiang, Wang Zhiwei, Hu Fengxiang, and Zhang Yichen were publicly elected as temporary directors. The association's address is No. 4 Shanghai Hong Kong Road. It is determined that the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company is poorly managed. If our government does not actively find a way to recover and operate it independently, it will not be enough to protect national rights and safeguard the interests of merchants and civilians. The association will lead Chinese users to take effective measures and absolutely not cooperate with the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation as a backing. We hereby telegram to report and request instructions. Another telegram was sent to the Ministry of Communications with the same general idea. Another telegram was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting a serious protest. The rest were also roughly the same and are omitted.</p>
<h3 id="e77">French Concession Opposes the Two-Percent Surtax <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>▲ Letter from the French Municipal Council to the Chinese Taxpayers Association</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession is striving to abolish the two-percent extra surtax, which has attracted the attention of the French authorities and the Chinese taxpayers of the French Concession. The French Municipal Council discussed the issue of the existence or abolition of the aforementioned two-percent surtax at the regular meeting on Monday and decided to hold another meeting on Friday, inviting representatives designated by the Chinese Taxpayers Association to participate. A translated copy of the French Municipal Council's letter to the Chinese Taxpayers Association is as follows: In response to your association's letter of July 5th regarding the house tax in the French Concession, the Superintendent (Valdès himself) has already had a discussion with Mr. Zhang Xiaolin of your association and has scheduled a meeting to be held at the Municipal Council at 4:00 pm on the 11th of this month (Friday) to study this issue. Please designate several representatives from your association to attend the meeting at that time. We would be very grateful. This is a respectful message to the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession. Valdès, Superintendent of the Public Security and Municipal Affairs, informs. It is said that the association will convene a representatives' conference in the afternoon of the 11th to discuss countermeasures.</p>

<p>City Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3 id="e79">Submission of Opinions on Protecting Commerce <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>▲ Submitting a Petition for the National Government to Implement</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Chamber of Commerce took over various documents from the Commercial Consolidation Association, it has been handling each item according to the review of proposals from various industries during the Delegates' Assembly. Here, we select and record important cases as follows:</p>
<p>㈠ Regarding the case of not arbitrarily occupying guild houses without the permission of the industry, a document was submitted to the National Government's Bureau of Social Affairs, the Municipal Party Department, and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, earnestly requesting protection. The document stated: "Submitting a petition for the resolution of the Members' Delegates Assembly regarding industry guilds' houses, requesting government authorities to strictly prohibit any agency from arbitrarily occupying them without the guild's permission, in order to protect property rights. We respectfully request your review and implementation." This case was brought up on June 21st when the Shanghai Commercial Consolidation Association convened a Members' Delegates Assembly. Representatives from the silk and dried goods industries proposed that guild houses should not be arbitrarily occupied without permission. The original reason for the proposal stated: "Upon investigation, guild houses are often forcibly occupied by labor unions or recruitment committees without the guild's permission. Each industry guild has a tax obligation to the country, and the country should legally be responsible for fully protecting property rights. It is proposed that the Assembly petition the central and municipal party, political, and military authorities to strictly prohibit illegal occupation of houses without the guild's permission, in order to protect property rights," and it was resolved to be handled by the Executive Committee. After the Association was established, it conducted a detailed review and found that the claim in the original case, that labor unions and recruiters arbitrarily occupied guild houses, was a pain commonly felt by each guild. As examples, the houses of the shoe industry guild have been occupied by labor unions and have not been vacated to this day, greatly hindering the Fu Lü Hospital attached to the guild. The Yunshan Elementary School attached to the coal industry guild was occupied by a teacher-led recruitment committee, causing the school to be unable to hold classes. There are many other similar situations too numerous to mention. It is believed that Articles 765 and 767 of the Civil Code's Property Law provide very detailed regulations for the protection of ownership. If any agency can freely occupy property and public power does not stop it, then the law is no more than a written document, and property rights lose their protection. The resulting abuses will inevitably lead to social order being destroyed. Since this case has been approved by the Assembly, it should be recorded and submitted to your office for review. It is humbly requested that you order each labor union and each unit to obtain the consent of each industry guild beforehand and sign a contract approved by a higher authority before moving in if they have no choice but to borrow the houses of various industry guilds in the future. If there is no such procedure, it is clear evidence of one party's free occupation. After each guild reports it, in addition to immediately ordering them to move out, they should also be severely punished according to the circumstances, in order to reverse the trend and provide protection. This is a public benefit."</p>
<p>㈠ Regarding the case of personnel serving in party and government agencies using domestic goods, a document was submitted to the National Government, stating: "Submitting a petition for the resolution of the Delegates' Assembly that party, government, and military agencies have often failed to implement orders to use domestic goods, proposing that the National Government reiterate its sincere admonishment to serve as a warning. We respectfully request your review and implementation." This case was brought up on June 21st when the Shanghai Commercial Consolidation Association convened a Members' Delegates Assembly. According to a temporary proposal by silk industry representative Wu Xingcha, the party, government, and military agencies should comply with the National Government's order to use domestic goods. It was resolved to be approved. After the Association was established, it was transferred by the Commercial Consolidation Association. It is believed that the regulations on clothing have long been stipulated, and all materials should use domestic goods. Furthermore, your government has issued clear orders and sincere admonitions regarding the promotion of domestic goods, which should have led to a rapid transformation and subtle influence, so that domestic silk and satin would have the hope of being revived. However, after examining the actual situation, not only are domestic silk, cotton, and other products unable to reverse the trend, but they are also gradually declining and closing down one after another, to the point that they are almost unable to sustain themselves. The general public tends to follow the fashion, regarding imported goods as trendy and domestic products as shabby. And the senior officials of party, government, and military agencies, who have the responsibility of leading the public to change customs, have also failed to avoid this trend. As a result, the public is also being influenced and assimilated. This kind of frenzy will lead to hundreds of millions of farmers and workers being displaced, shaking the foundation of the country. Is the danger not small? Wei Wen Gong's cloth garments in ancient history have been praised as a beautiful story, which is sufficient to show that promoting thrift and plugging loopholes is a common principle of ancient and modern times for emerging countries. To reverse ingrained habits, it is especially important for those who have the responsibility of setting an example for the people to be able to lead by example, so that the general public will not laugh at the mention of promoting domestic goods, viewing it as a fashionable formality. This is what is meant by teaching by example. It is hereby submitted to your office for review. It is humbly requested that you reiterate your admonishment to all party, government, and military agency personnel that all clothing must be made of domestic materials. Those who disobey should be subject to reputational sanctions by the leaders of their respective agencies, so that the declining trend can be reversed and domestic production can be revived. We are eagerly awaiting orders."</p>

<h3 id="e80">Leased Location of the Resident Office in Shanghai <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>In order to facilitate contact with China, the International Labour Bureau has specially dispatched Secretary Chen Zongcheng to China to establish a branch in Nanjing and appointed Mr. Chen as the director of the bureau. Now, the bureau believes that Shanghai has the most factories, which is convenient for contact, and has decided to set up an office in Shanghai. It is learned that the bureau has leased a room on the fourth floor of the Jianghai Customs Office, formerly the Industry and Commerce Visitation Bureau, as an office. Repairs are being made these days, and they will move in and start working in the next few days.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Compensation from Shanghai Arsenal to be Paid Out <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Arsenal previously had an accident in the drug-loading room, resulting in the death and injury of more than 30 workers. The arsenal has submitted two requests to the headquarters and the Ministry of Military Administration for compensation for the bereaved families. In addition to a temporary allocation of 120 yuan for funeral expenses, it also requested 500 yuan per person for compensation. The headquarters subsequently approved only 300 yuan per person. The compensation will be paid out next Monday (i.e., the 13th). However, the arsenal believes that the drug-loading workers have been working in the factory for 20 to 30 years, and no better compensation can encourage newcomers. Therefore, it has taken out another 2,000 yuan from the arsenal's public surplus funds and raised more than 1,600 yuan from employees, expecting that each of the deceased can receive a total of 500 yuan. As for the injured, the amount of compensation will depend on the severity of the injury, generally at least 15 yuan for minor injuries and up to 150 yuan for serious injuries. Yesterday, the arsenal has sent letters to each family member, informing them to collect the money from the factory on time. The accident of the drug-loading workers in the arsenal, which has been delayed for more than a month, can be completely resolved next week.</p>
<h3 id="e82">The Association of Families of the May 30th Incident Will Be Delayed <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The Association of Families of Martyrs of the Shanghai May 30th Massacre originally scheduled to end its work after June 30th. Now, due to the newly registered injured comrades Wang Ruping, Li Yixun, Mei Zhonglin, Zhou Renlian, Wei Chunting, Liu Shaoxian, and Chen Yunqiu, who were registered by a lawyer, totaling eight or nine people, the Association of Families is actively conducting separate investigations and verifications. In addition to the two representatives Hu and Chen, the Association has only two staff members, Secretary Zhou Zaisheng and Clerk Sun Guangfu. With few people and many affairs, they are unable to complete the work in a short time. It is estimated that the two procedures of investigation and verification can be completed in the next week, and the fifth batch of condolences can be paid out at the beginning of the next week. After this batch of condolences is paid out, the winding-up work will begin. It is also learned that the Association has hired accountant Jiang Xinzhao as an accounting consultant to check all condolence payments and other accounts on its behalf, and will publicly report on them.</p>
<h3 id="e83">News of the Strike by Workers at the French Concession Water and Electricity Company Yesterday <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The various sections of the conciliation meeting held by the workers of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company have already been recorded in previous reports. Here, we explore and record the situation yesterday as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Foremen were discovered at the meeting. The workers' union held a meeting of 600 workers in the stadium on the day before yesterday. Suddenly, more than a dozen foremen were found to be attending the meeting (foremen are not workers and are not members of the union). They intended to represent the workers to contact the factory to negotiate conditions and solicit the opinions of the workers. However, all the workers believed that this action was a running dog of the capitalists and unanimously rejected it. Therefore, the foremen came with enthusiasm and returned with disappointment. However, the union side believes that the capitalists' methods of sabotage are pervasive and raised this issue for discussion at yesterday's committee meeting.</p>
<p>▲ Each labor union decided to help the union. Representatives were sent to contact each labor union to request assistance and report the facts about the French factory's unreasonable oppression and deception. It is said that each level of labor union was filled with righteous indignation. As soon as the meeting is held for discussion, the method of assistance will be announced.</p>
<p>▲ The Municipal Party Department, which is deeply worried about the delay in resolving the strike by the French electricity workers, will convene a meeting with party, government, and military representatives this afternoon to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<p>▲ A petition may be filed today. At 9:00 a.m. today, more than 600 workers of the union will go to the Municipal People's Training Association to petition. In addition to requesting assistance, the purpose is to request the speedy release of worker Song Youxing and to vigorously find ways to continue to arrest and bring to justice the saboteur Chen Qiaosong, who was previously sent to the Municipal Party Department for strict handling but has been released by the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e84">A Case of Dispute in the Western Clothing Union <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>▲ Firing Workers Without Reason</p>
<p>▲ Causing Major Negotiations</p>
<p>Five people from Ningbo, including Zhou Baomo, Tu Xinggen, Zheng Youshui, Shao Kaihuai, and Hu Akang, have been working as tailors in the fire brigade of the Public Concession on Wusong Road in this city for four years and have been getting along well. However, for some unknown reason a month ago, the fire brigade suddenly ordered the dismissal of the five workers, causing major negotiations. According to the investigation, the Western Clothing Union in this city immediately contacted the fire brigade in writing and also sent a letter to request the Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association to help urge the Industry Bureau to give preferential treatment to the workers. Because the fire brigade refused to yield, all the requests of the union were rejected. Although the Chinese Ratepayers Association claimed to have sent a request, the Industry Bureau has not made any response for many days. Therefore, the executive committee of the Western Clothing Union is holding joint meetings every day to discuss this case. It is said that it has drafted five concrete measures: ㈠ Send a letter to urge the Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association to urge the Industry Bureau to reply as soon as possible; ㈡ Submit a petition to the Municipal Party Department and the Bureau of Social Affairs to take charge and convene a labor-capital arbitration committee to resolve the issue when necessary; ㈢ Advertise to all labor unions in the city to request unanimous support to facilitate negotiations; ㈣ (Omitted); ㈤ Call on all Western clothing workers to march and demonstrate and petition the fire brigade and the Industry Bureau of the Public Concession until a satisfactory solution is reached.</p>

<p>Since the issue occurred at the Tianjin Customs, the import and export of passengers and goods have been greatly reduced. Some of the commercial ships of various countries have temporarily suspended sailing, and some have changed their routes. In recent days, because the Ministry of Finance has properly arranged the method for the Shanghai Customs to collect taxes on its behalf, the transportation of passengers and goods has returned to its former state. In recent days, the number of passengers and goods on each sea liner sailing from Shanghai to Tianjin has suddenly increased. The Shengjing Maru, which exported yesterday, carried more than 1,000 tons of various goods, including about 10,000 bundles of paper and about 1,200 bags of sugar. Other sea liners of British companies Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire also carried many goods. In addition, the Tangshan Maru, which sailed from Tianjin to Shanghai yesterday, also carried more than 1,000 tons of passengers and goods. The transportation of goods between Tianjin and Shanghai has returned to its original state.</p>

<p>▲ Shashi Can Pass Through In the past week, bandits similar to the Red Spear Society were discovered along the Yangtze River from Shishou and Gong'an in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to the Shashi area, obstructing merchant ships sailing up and down the river. Subsequently, Britain, Japan, and the United States each sent one or two warships to escort them. Yesterday, the Shanghai shipping companies received a telegram from Hankou stating that the bandits had been defeated by the army and that it was safe to sail up and down the Yangtze River from the 8th. Export goods from Shanghai to Shashi and other ports can now be loaded.</p>
<p>▲ The Japanese Wheel Maintains the Status Quo After the sharp drop in silver prices, the upstream shipping of Nissin Steamship Company has been affected by the increased expenditure on ships and has not been able to increase the water fare without authorization. Last month, the president of the company came to China from the east to inspect the ports along the Yangtze River and advocated reducing the number of shifts on the Changde, Xianghu, and Yanghe lines above Hankou to save expenses. This matter has been resolved, but recently, the company, in view of the fact that the Chinese and British shipping companies in the Yangtze River line are increasing ships and expanding, has temporarily changed its plan to cancel the contraction plan of reducing ships and shifts and maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>▲ The Wanliu Can Be Rescued The Swire Shipping Company's Wanliu Wheel ran aground 40 miles downstream of Chongqing, the hull was damaged, and the engine was also damaged. Now, a telegram from Yichang said that after the cargo in each cabin was unloaded, the hole was being repaired and temporarily coated with cement to make it float to the surface of the river. The project will be completed soon and can be towed to Shanghai for major repairs.</p>

<h3 id="e89">The Fifth Day of the Cooperative Promotion Week <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the fifth day of the cooperative movement promotion week in this city. The Preparatory Committee, together with the five district party headquarters and the first directly affiliated branch, led the people in each district to carry out various activities separately. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Jiangwan On the day before yesterday (the 8th), the Jiangwan district held a cooperative movement promotion conference. The seven district party headquarters and the municipal government committee had prepared everything beforehand. At 4:00 p.m. that afternoon, a meeting was held at the Qiujiang Elementary School behind the Dasi Temple, with a total of 300 people from various groups, branches, schools, local 保 (bao), and the public.

Then, there was a performance. Qiujiang Elementary School's dance included four sections: ㈠ Little Swallows, ㈡ Falling Flowers and Flowing Water, ㈢ Su Wu Herding Sheep, ㈣ Picking Water Chestnuts. The postures were beautiful and the singing was very pleasant, especially Ms. Zhou Lindi's (5) Jiangsheng team's comedy (Thief Catching Thief) (Laughing Play) was slippery and funny (6) The Labor University graduates' boxing skills (7) The Public Security Bureau's Beijing opera were all very pleasant to listen to. The meeting ended at seven o'clock. In terms of propaganda, in addition to the propaganda teams from the seven districts, five or six kinds of cooperative propaganda materials were distributed, which were very popular with the public.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Some People Advocate Imposing a Western Clothing Tax <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>▲ Wu Chao Gong's Letter to Wang Yansong</p>
<p>Since the Executive Committee of this city resolved to strictly prohibit party and government personnel from wearing Western clothing and recommended Wang Yansong to consult with the municipal government on handling the matter, Wang Yansong drafted a plan and sent a letter to the French Municipal Government for discussion. Now, Wu Chao Gong, a citizen living in Si Da Li, North Sichuan Road, advocates levying a Western clothing tax to incorporate the prohibition in the collection. He sent a letter to Wang Yansong yesterday. The original letter said: (Omitted above) The Municipal Party Department discussed and strictly prohibited party and government personnel from wearing Western clothing at the 22nd meeting and recommended Mr. Wang to consult with the municipal government on handling the matter. Gong is very happy that the proposer has the same heart as me and hopes that the proposal will be passed and implemented. Upon investigation, the goods imported by our country over the years are more than the exports, of which clothing items account for the majority of the imported goods. Because Chinese people regard foreigners as the supreme superiors and regard themselves as inferior and despicable, they must wear Western clothing, eat Western food, and live in Western houses. There is no need to say that the daily necessities are all fashionable from foreign countries and regard domestic products as敝屣 (discarded like old shoes). Initially, it was due to the compradors and servants of foreign firms, followed by students who imitated them, and then businessmen and even unemployed idlers who wore Western clothing as superiors. Now, there are more than a hundred times more people wearing Western clothing in Shanghai than a few years ago. If this continues for more than ten years, all people in Shanghai, from the intellectual class to the rickshaw pullers, must wear Western clothing. If the government still turns a blind eye and does not take action, I am afraid that in a few years, no one will ask about Chinese cotton cloth and silk, silver will flow out, the people will be poor and their wealth will be exhausted, there will be more unemployed people, and there will be more bandits. Recalling a few months ago, the Silk Association used all their efforts to create various advertisements to persuade Chinese people to remove Western clothing and use domestic goods. However, the speaker was sincere and the listener was indifferent and there was no effect. The intellectual middle class is willing to be a foreign slave and has no patriotism. It is difficult to achieve practical results if this kind of slavery is admonished with good words, and there is no way to do it without coercive measures. Moreover, the people in the inland areas follow the dress in Shanghai, so Shanghai can be called the model district for clothing in the country. If Shanghai does not strictly take action, it will be even more harmful to follow it in the future. Therefore, it is better to levy a Western clothing tax than to persuade them to remove Western clothing. All Chinese people who want to wear Western clothing must go to the government office to pay the Western clothing tax, charging 50 to 100 yuan per person per year. In this way, if the prohibition is incorporated into the collection, there will naturally be fewer people wearing Western clothing, and the accessories of foreign goods will also be reduced accordingly. Then domestic goods can be promoted without mentioning it, the factory will be developed, and the unemployed can also be slightly less. If only party and government personnel are banned, it will inevitably be a incomplete measure and the effect will be small. Gong Xue is ignorant and has little knowledge to help the times, but I have fulfilled my responsibilities as a citizen and dare to make humble opinions in order to seek your guidance. I only ask that you, sir, go further and teach me. I am extremely apprehensive and panicky.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Follow-up News on the Japanese Ship Crashing the Norwegian Ship <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>▲ Salvaging the Sunken Ship After the Diepputot number, a coal carrier of the 开濼 (kai po) Company, was sunk by the Japanese ship Fengtian Maru, the 开濼 company began planning yesterday for how to deal with the aftermath. The Haizhu Bay where the accident occurred is within the Beiyang shipping route, which all ships must pass through. If it is left unsalvaged, it will hinder the traffic of the waterway and endanger the ships. Therefore, it has contacted the Shanghai manager of the Tokyo Salvage Company of Japan to discuss the salvage procedure. It has now been agreed that it will begin salvaging after the shipowner Johnson returns to Shanghai and asks about the situation.</p>
<p>▲ Arbitrating Responsibility Although the Diepputot number's accident was in heavy fog, it was ultimately hit by the Fengtian Maru. The company has already made representations to Dalian Steamboat Company. It is said that the Dalian company still needs to ask the shipowner about the matter and has not agreed to take full responsibility. The two companies have decided to ask an impartial person to investigate the truth and then submit it to arbitration for public judgment. As for the Fengtian Maru, a telegram has been sent to Shanghai saying that the slight damage to the bow has been repaired and it will be allowed to sail to Shanghai on the 12th.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce LP]</p>
<h3 id="e92">Please Exempt the Export Tax on Ground Sugar <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, saying that the Sugar Trade Association previously wrote a letter stating that the customs and tax department considered it to be a local product and ordered it to pay the export tax again if they purchase and transport Javanese sugar, grind it into fine sand and sell it, which they could not afford, so they requested that it be forwarded for cancellation. The former Commercial Consolidation Association believed that Javanese sugar was imported by Dutch ships and had already paid the import tax in accordance with regulations. According to the usual practice of foreign goods, not only is the original piece packed and shipped, but also disassembled into parts, and it has never been taxed repeatedly. The reason is that although the packaging is different, the quality and composition have not changed, so it cannot be strongly pointed out that it is a local product transformed from foreign goods. The industry grinds Javanese sugar to suit the market, but the characteristics and taste remain the same, and the composition has not changed. As cited in the original letter, the imported pigments and butter are disassembled and mixed, and the Fat Tian powder exported by Bu Neimen is mixed with impurities, but they are not taxed as local goods. However, for the ground Javanese sugar, which does not change the original quality, it is ordered to pay the export tax separately as a local product, which is inevitable to make Chinese merchants feel short of breath. Moreover, it is said that the commission earned on each load of ground sugar is only a few cents, but the export tax is ordered to be 45 cents per load, so no sugar merchant is willing to lose money to operate this trade, which is tantamount to vigorously opening up sales channels for Japanese sugar. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce was telegraphed to review and request cancellation, and on May 28, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce approved the cancellation of the telegram and informed the Ministry of Finance to review and handle the matter. It is respectfully known that the telegram was ordered to be investigated and handled. On June 21, when the former Commercial Consolidation Association convened a meeting of members and representatives of various industries to establish the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Sugar Trade Association again submitted the previous situation and applied for relief. It was resolved to transfer it to our association for handling at the second executive meeting of our association on July 7. According to the previous case, we respectfully requested your department to seek the Lord. It is hereby recorded and presented for your review. It is telegraphed to request that you quickly investigate and handle it. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce requested that the method of repeatedly taxing the item of ground Javanese grain by analogy with the transformation of local goods should be cancelled, so as to maintain the business of sugar merchants and serve the public. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully kowtows.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Luo Xishun Requests Investigation into False Accusations <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Labor Union of the Pharmaceutical Industry yesterday submitted a document to the Citizen Training Council and the Social Bureau of the City, stating that the petition was made to refute malicious accusations and maintain a livelihood and reputation. It was reported that the union had received a letter from member Luo Xishun stating that he had recently read a news item in the local newspaper about Xi Changsheng's dismissal of employees and how difficult things were. He was shocked that the employer dared to fabricate such accusations under the clear blue sky, spewing venomous blood to harm people, and that the intention was so sinister that it was infuriating. The previous time, he fabricated accusations and presented them to the Municipal Social Bureau. Fortunately, the Social Bureau saw through his tricks and ordered him to reinstate the worker, but Xishun had already suffered a lot of mental pain. However, the employer was still not satisfied and falsely accused him to the trade association by fabricating facts. The shop owner, Xi Shaofeng, was inherently impatient, irritable, and unreasonable. Three years ago, he suddenly suffered from a mental disorder, which occurred and healed from time to time, several times a year. Now, he is using this to falsely accuse him, which is ridiculous. It is very common for shop employees to join or leave, so how can it cause the shop owner to have a mental disorder? Even if there is a possibility of inducing illness, the shop owner has been ill for three years, and Xishun joined the shop last fall, which are all facts. Judging from the principles of things and human feelings, discerning people can easily judge the right and wrong without Xishun's detailed defense. However, since he has used such insidious tricks, he has to report all the facts to the union so that it can handle the matter impartially. Since Xishun has been serving in the shop, he has been clean and self-respecting, cautious and devoted to his duties, and has never dared to be negligent. However, he is inherently honest and straightforward, and flattery is not his forte. The shop owner's wife has the deepest dictatorial ideas, and she does not understand the work situation of the shop employees at all. She interferes at every turn, and if things do not go as she wishes, she scolds endlessly. The other employees dare to be angry but dare not speak out. Only Xishun, for the sake of his own personality, cannot help but stand up and question when there is too much oppression. Therefore, the shop owner's wife's hatred is even deeper, which is a major reason for her repeated thoughts of falsely accusing him. Just like the previous false accusations to the Social Bureau, fortunately, the matter was resolved impartially and it was decided to reinstate him. The shop owner actually said in the petition that the dismissal failed because the union was protecting him. Does he regard the laws and regulations of the Social Bureau as worthless? He is reversing right and wrong to such an extent. However, the shop owner, Xi Shaofeng, is known for his violent nature. The shop owner's wife (the second wife) is even more tyrannical and unreasonable. Conflicts often arise between the husband and wife, leading to a mental disorder.</p>
<p>This is an undeniable fact. Unexpectedly, the shop owner's wife used this to falsely accuse Xishun. The ignorance of a woman is not enough to blame deeply, but unexpectedly, the trade association also does not understand the truth and does not ask for the truth. It rashly distributed the slanderous petition to the newspapers, deliberately destroying Xishun's reputation and the future of the workers, which is very dangerous. Xishun is only concerned with the livelihood of his whole family and endures humiliation and begs for help. The shop owner actually thinks that the weak can be bullied. He falsely accused the worker Gu Mingxing last fall, but now he falsely accuses Xishun, how can Xishun endure it? Therefore, he has specially written a document requesting the union to forward it to the higher authorities to appeal for injustice and to request the shop owner to compensate for the loss of reputation in order to warn the mischievous. The union has approved this and sent personnel to investigate, and it was reported that the accusations made by the shop owner's wife were completely fabricated and had no evidence. According to this, it is specially requested that the union (bureau) impartially criticize and approve appropriate punishment to warn the mischievous, maintain a livelihood, and protect reputation. This is the most convenient way. (Omitted below) It is heard that the employee Luo</p>
<p>Xishun has directly sent a letter to the National Pharmaceutical Industry Association, demanding a clear reply within three days and will resort to law to file a claim for damages to his reputation.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Salary Issues for Railway Employees <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The salaries of employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways have always been based on monthly salaries. Those with monthly salaries above one hundred yuan receive an annual salary increase of ten yuan per month, and those with monthly salaries above fifty yuan receive an annual salary increase of eight yuan per month. This time, the Ministry of Railways promulgated a salary scale in which those with monthly salaries above fifty yuan receive an annual salary increase of only five yuan per month, and the highest salary for section members is only one hundred and eighty yuan. All employees believe that the current prices have increased several times, but the fixed salaries are less than before, and the salary increase of only five yuan for those with more than fifty yuan is not enough to cope with the environment and maintain life. Many employees of the accounting department have submitted a request to Director Liu to consider the special circumstances of Shanghai and approve the request to the Ministry of Railways for special treatment, and to continue to follow the old rules.</p>

<p>The 12 captains of the Shanghai South District Defense Corps have received instructions from the corps headquarters, Deputy Corps Leaders Ye Wang, to suspend drills and wait for reorganization, as reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that after receiving the order, the captains ordered the military equipment and supplies departments to prepare for transfer. The corps headquarters has also made careful plans to merge the fourth, fifth, and twelfth squads into one squad, and the remaining first, second, third, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh squads will still follow the original organization method, with each squad recruiting 108 members. The position of squad leader will still be held by the original squad leader, but after the merger of the fourth, fifth, and twelfth squads, the former squad leaders were Zhu, Qian, and Tu. The corps headquarters has decided to select two of these three squad leaders to be appointed as the regular and deputy squad leaders. After this reorganization, the South Shanghai District has reorganized into nine squads in total. The members of each group have been rushing to the corps headquarters to fill out registration forms, and there are quite a few applicants. If the number of members in each squad is not full of 108, they will be recruited immediately. If there is a surplus, they will be changed to reserve members. Yesterday, Gao Ziyun, the captain of the first squad, and Feng Runsheng, the captain of the third squad, received appointment orders from the corps headquarters.</p>

<p>▲ Rescued on Meixie Road in Nanshi</p>
<p>▲ Three Male and Female Kidnappers Arrested</p>
<p>Song Ruisheng, the five-year-old son of Song Runsheng, the owner of Runchang Hardware Store at 181 Datong Road, Zhabei, disappeared while playing at the door at about 9:00 am the day before yesterday (the 7th). Unexpectedly, the kidnappers sent a letter that afternoon, demanding 300 yuan to redeem him. Song knew that his son had been kidnapped. The next day, he received another letter and reported it to the Fourth District General Administration, which immediately ordered detectives to make two arrests. This morning, they broke the case in Hexinli, Meixie Road, Nanshi, rescued the hostage, and arrested the kidnappers Chen Xiaoyun and others. The details of the case are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Family Store, Song Ruisheng, a 30-year-old man from Pudong, runs Runchang Hardware Store. It is a single storefront business that is not bad, but the economy is not wealthy enough. His wife, Tao, 32 years old, has a daughter, Gendi, 8 years old, and a young son, Yunfu, 5 years old, who are not in school. Song is quite frugal. There is only one employee in the store, who is responsible for managing accounts and other matters, while his wife and daughter assist in the store's business, making it a family store.</p>
<p>▲ Young Son Disappears, At around 9:00 am on the 7th, Song's young son, Yunfu, was playing in front of the store when a man suddenly offered him candy and gave him a few copper coins. Yunfu, without knowing anything, fell into his trap and followed him happily. At first, Song did not think much about it. When it was time for lunch and he still had not returned, he became suspicious and sent out detectives, but there was no news. His wife cried bitterly.</p>
<p>▲ Two Letters from Kidnappers, While Song and his wife were full of worry and at a loss, a letter was delivered by the post office. After opening it, it turned out to be a ransom letter from a kidnapper. It said, "Brothers,</p>
<p>We have been unemployed for a long time and are in economic difficulties. We are borrowing 300 yuan. Please wrap the money in white paper and put it in garbage can number 125 next to Shenxiutang on Xinzha Road at 3:00 am. We will send someone to pick it up. Do not be stingy or you will regret it." It was signed Xu Yongchang. After receiving the letter, Song was shocked and didn't know what to do because he didn't have such a large sum of money. He decided to ignore it. Unexpectedly, he received another letter the next day with harsh words, saying that if he didn't find a way to redeem the ticket, it would be unfavorable to his whole family. The contact point was in Peideli, Xinzha Road. The person who came must hold a newspaper. Song reported to the Fourth District General Administration for investigation because the time was tight.</p>
<p>▲ Enemy Mastermind, After receiving the report, Director Jin immediately ordered his subordinates to cooperate with Team Leader He Xiong, Detective Zhou Guicai, Li Guiqing, Yao Ziyun, Shi Yunling, Zhao Zhennan, Li Zongnian, and others from the Detective Team to secretly go to the address together with the detectives from the Xinzha Police Station, disguised as beggars, villagers, and vendors. Unexpectedly, after waiting until 3:00 am yesterday, no one came. Detective He had an idea and questioned Song about whether he had any enemies. Song suddenly remembered that Chen Xiaoyun, whom he had known recently, had come to his house to ask about the kidnapping of his son, which was suspicious. Detective He went to 48 Nanxing Road, Zhabei, and arrested Chen. After a strict interrogation, Chen confessed that he was the principal offender and that he had written the threatening letter. The hostage was currently hidden on the front floor of No. 5 Hexinli, Meixie Road, Nanshi.</p>
<p>▲ Rescuing the Hostage, After the detectives learned the location of the hostage, they notified the Second District General Administration in advance at around 9:00 am yesterday and secretly surrounded the neighborhood. They broke into house number 5 in the neighborhood and found the young hostage being held in a woman's arms. They stepped forward, snatched him away, and brought the woman, Chen Yao (22 years old, from Zhenjiang), and the second landlord, Xu Wu (from Shanghai), along with them. Director Jin asked them in detail one by one. He ordered that the principal offender, Chen Xiaoyun (23 years old, from Zhenjiang), Chen Yao, and Xu Wu be sent to the Public Security Bureau for strict handling because the case was related to kidnapping. The hostage, Song Yunfu, was handed over to his family to take back.</p>
<h3 id="e100">A Blind Man's Wife <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>▲ Has Two Lovers</p>
<p>▲ And Both Are Blind</p>
<p>▲ Triangular Blind Love</p>
<p>▲ Almost Caused a Tragedy</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 6:00 pm, a three-blind-person love affair involving one woman occurred in the jurisdiction of the Second District General Administration of Nanshi. One of them attempted suicide by opium due to unrequited love, almost causing a tragedy. The matter was quite strange. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ A Blind Man Marries a Romantic Woman, Zhang Aliu, a local blind man, 35 years old, currently residing at No. 10 Heshengli, Laoximen, Nanshi, makes a living by chanting scriptures. He married Zhang Zong, a local woman, 34 years old, who is ugly in appearance and naturally flirtatious. Seeing that her husband is blind, she often looks for new love. As a result, scandalous rumors spread far and wide.</p>
<p>▲ Co-conspires with Another Blind Man, Zong knows that she is ugly and knows that it is not appropriate, so she specializes in co-conspiring with blind people. There is a blind fortune teller from Songjiang, Hongkou, named Jin Dehai (37 years old), who is familiar with Zhang. In April of this year, he and Zong had an ambiguous relationship. Although Zhang knew about this, he acted like a fool and a deaf man, implementing the policy of the henpecked husband.</p>
<p>▲ Also Falls in Love with a Third Blind Man, After Jin had an affair with Zong, they had been living in peace. Unexpectedly, before a month had passed, Zong became tired of him again and had an affair with Xu Xingsheng (37 years old, from Wuxi), Jin's uncle, who lived at No. 94 Siheli, Lujiabang. Xu is also blind and works as a fortune teller. Before long, the matter was heard by Jin. Jin was extremely angry, but he was afraid that the matter would be leaked out, which would be unfavorable to both parties, so he kept it a secret.</p>
<p>▲ Xu Xingsheng Actually Hides, Xu Xingsheng, seeing that Zhang Jin'er was obstructing him, could not get what he wanted, so he thought of occupying her for himself. On the 28th day of the previous month, he hid Zong at No. 6 of a technique-based family in Furunli, Xinzha Road. Five days later, Zhang Aliu discovered it and immediately gathered a group of hooligans and snatched Xu and Zong back together on Xinzha Road. It was agreed that Xu would pay 30 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Losing Both Person and Money, Planning to Suicide, Xu had no money, so he discussed it with Jin, saying that if Jin was willing to pay 30 yuan, the rights would belong to Jin alone. Jin agreed, and the money was handed over to Jin the next day, and he actually lived with her. Unexpectedly, although the matter was over, she still could not forget Xu, so she quarreled with Jin all day long, looking for trouble on purpose. A few days ago, she suddenly disappeared again. Jin, seeing that he had lost both person and money, was ashamed and angry, so he secretly swallowed a full dose of opium last night at 6:00 pm.</p>
<p>▲ Neighbors Noticed and Sent to the Police Station, Fortunately, the neighbors noticed it at that time and urgently reported it to the Sanguantang Police Station of the Second District General Administration. The patrol officer rushed to the scene and sent Jin to Shanghai Hospital. Fortunately, he had not swallowed it for a long time and the poison had not erupted. After the doctor irrigated him, the poison was completely vomited out. He was then sent to the General Administration together with Zong and others. After Director Wang asked a question, Jin confessed that in April of this year, my (I refer to myself) sister gave me more than 100 yuan for my mother's funeral expenses, which were all spent on Zong. Now I think that I have lost both person and money, so I swallowed opium to commit suicide. After Director Wang took the confession, he immediately prepared a document and sent it to the General Bureau for verification.</p>

<p>▲ Kathaisin's Confession at the British Police Station</p>
<p>Da Wanbao reported that Kathaisin, an Indian doorman, was arrested at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Baoxing Road on the night of the 3rd and taken to the British Police Court for distributing inflammatory leaflets. After the first trial, the court reopened this morning (9th) for a continued hearing. Western Police Officer Watson, Special Patrol Officer Esack, and Japanese Police Officer Yamaguchi testified that they had witnessed the distribution of leaflets and the arrest. The interrogator asked the defendant if he had any confession. The defendant claimed that Indians could not receive fair treatment. This time, the patrol officer dragged him from the Chinese territory into the construction.</p>
<p>The interrogator then announced that the preliminary hearing was established and he was detained for interrogation at the Court of Justice.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Returned to Shanghai Safely After Escaping Danger in Jiangxi <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Da Wanbao reported that the British missionary couple, Mr. and Mrs. Spokeen, were kidnapped by bandits in Jiangxi on March 22nd and rescued on the 29th of last month. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday (8th) by Wuhu ship.

It is said that they will return to their country for rest after their spirits have recovered.</p>
<p>[P Rape Seed Export Issue Resolved</p>
<p>The local grain export industry's rape seeds shipped abroad to Wuhu were previously rejected by Japanese merchants on the grounds that the water content was too high and mold was found. As a result, 20,000 bags of rape seeds for export to Japan were detained and not accepted, causing huge losses after being piled up in the warehouse for many days. After repeated negotiations by the industry representatives, an agreement has been reached and shipments began yesterday. One thousand bags will be loaded per ship, and the 20,000 bags in stock should be shipped back within this month.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Dispute over the Mobilization of the Yidu Steamer's Crew <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The American Shangjiang shallow steamer Yidu, which travels along the Yangtze River in the Yichang area, recently suffered damage to its hull and came to Shanghai to enter the Qiuxin Iron Factory Shipyard for repairs. During this period, a trend of the company mobilizing the entire crew of the steamer occurred. It is estimated that dozens of people have been dismissed, from compradors and accountants to tea attendants and handymen (except for sailors and drivers). The compradores of the steamer did not know it at first. Yesterday, Mr. Zhou, the newly appointed general comprador, brought all the newly appointed crew members and a letter from the company to the captain, requesting to take over the matter. The old crew refused to hand over the matter. At the same time, the old general comprador asked the captain to take 7,000 yuan of deposit cabinet money and 450 yuan of salary, and asked the captain to sign a receipt immediately so that he could claim it from the company. The captain said that the mobilization of the crew was entirely the company's intention and he was absolutely not involved, so he did not agree. The old crew members did not hand over the ship and leave the ship, so the new crew members could not take over, which caused a long brewing. Later, the old crew's big and secondary compradores went to the company to negotiate, but they could not resolve the matter satisfactorily for a while. The captain of the steamer reported to the water patrol police station for investigation because the old crew refused to hand over the ship's affairs, which caused the ship to be stranded. Tan Huang Song was sent to investigate the ship. The old three compradores, Mr. Wang, stated the difficulty of not being able to leave the ship for a while. Tan ordered that all the old crew members on the ship must land before 12:00 noon tomorrow (today) and must not stay away again, and notified the captain to allow them to stay on the ship for one more day and expedite the handover at the same time. The old crew members requested to negotiate with the company. It is estimated that the dispute over the handover of the new and old crew members can be resolved from now on.</p>

<p>▲ Chen Guibao Died in Vain</p>
<p>Chen Guibao, a 21-year-old man from Yangzhou, lived at No. 13 Guixiangli, Linheng Road, Ximen. The day before yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 pm, he suddenly went to the Suzhou River to take off his clothes and swim because the weather was hot. Because he didn't know how to swim, his body sank to the bottom of the river. The spectators on both sides couldn't see him coming up and tried to rescue him in every possible way, but Chen's body drifted away and he couldn't be rescued, so he drowned in the river. The body had not floated up until the evening. Yesterday morning at 6:00 am, Chen Changming, a member of the corpse family, reported to the water patrol police station to pay attention to finding the body for collection. It is said that the deceased was bare-chested and wore a pair of blue cloth pants.</p>

<h3 id="e108">The Jin Chen Divorce Case Was Resolved Amicably <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Jin Axi from the county hired lawyer Shen Yong to sue his wife Chen Aer in the local court for disturbing and demanding money, requesting a divorce to prevent future troubles. The statement stated that he married the defendant as his wife in August of the Republic of China's sixth year. However, the defendant could not settle down. In the Republic of China's eighth year, the defendant fled without a trace and took his daughter Lin Xian with her. It was learned that the defendant had an affair with someone named Wang in Dachang Town and lived like a couple, giving birth to a nine-year-old son. It was also learned that Lin Xian had been sold. Now the defendant suddenly came to disturb him, but the couple had already broken up and the water was difficult to recover. Moreover, the defendant had recently been smoking opium and there was no possibility of reunion. There were four reasons for divorce: ㈠ When she fled, she took everything with her, even the incense burner, wax poles, and sundries. ㈡ It has been 12 years since she fled and there has been no news, except that she came home once in the Republic of China's eleventh year. ㈢ She sold the plaintiff's daughter Lin Xian without a trace. ㈣ She has been living with Wang Arluan and has a nine-year-old son. He requested permission to grant the divorce. Yesterday, Judge Yang Keqian opened a court hearing. The plaintiff Jin Axi stated the previous situation and questioned the defendant Chen Aer. The defendant completely denied it. The judge reconciled them in court. As a result, the plaintiff paid the defendant 50 yuan and both parties separated. The judge stated that according to the facts, there was no reason to give money, but considering the hardship, a small amount of compensation was given. Both parties expressed their willingness to reach an amicable agreement and signed the papers to leave the court.</p>
<p>Li Xingjuan's Divorce Case</p>
<h3 id="e109">Unable to Summon Her Husband <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>▲ Permission Granted to Arrest and Prosecute at Any Time</p>
<p>Li Xingjuan, a woman from Minhang, is 29 years old this year. She married Wu Baoqing (from Anhui) from the same town ten years ago through a matchmaker. However, Wu liked to wander around and did not engage in production. Therefore, all of Xingjuan's clothes and decorations were pawned shortly after she married. They lived together for three years and gave birth to a son. It was not enough to sit and eat the mountains empty. It was difficult for a clever woman to cook without rice. Forced by hunger and cold, Xingjuan had no choice but to leave home and find a place to eat. She was introduced by someone to work in a hospital and was diligent and thrifty, and was highly regarded by the hosts. She also asked someone to find Wu Baoqing a job, but Wu was lazy and soon lost his job again. With no way to make a living, he often went to Xingjuan to demand money by force. If he did not succeed, he would say rude things. Xingjuan could not bear the burden. For the sake of her lifelong happiness, she had no choice but to divorce him. Therefore, she hired lawyers Wang Zengxian and Yuan Xilian to file a petition with the local court, requesting a judgment to allow the divorce. Yesterday, Judge Du opened a court hearing. The defendant did not attend because his address was unknown and he could not be served. The plaintiff Li Xingjuan stated that she is now working as a nurse at Dr. Gong's place at No. 16 Zhenxingli, Linyin Road, Ximenwai. She married the defendant Wu Baoqing more than ten years ago. Wu is 36 years old this year and is said to still live in Minhang Town. Since she got married, the defendant has had no job and has been gambling all day long, disregarding the use of household items. The plaintiff can only find her own way to make a living. Since they separated, it has been ten years. The defendant occasionally asks the plaintiff for money to squander. Moreover, she has repeatedly recommended him for business, but he stops immediately, which shows that the defendant is bad. Now the plaintiff only earns more than ten yuan a month in salary, and her personal life is often insufficient. Where does she get the extra money to support his waste? She requested permission to divorce. The official asked if you had met the defendant recently. She replied that the defendant had sent a letter this year. At this point, lawyer Yuan stood up and presented the defendant's letter for inspection and said that our lawyer's office is a voluntary organization and does not charge fees. Because the defendant often harasses the plaintiff and cannot be reasoned with, he once advised the plaintiff that divorce is not a good thing and it would be best not to divorce, but the plaintiff insisted on the divorce, so he filed the lawsuit. The interrogator asked the plaintiff again and then stated that the defendant could not be summoned and the judgment could not be made today. Now the lawsuit in this case is suspended. If the plaintiff meets the defendant in the future, she will arrest the defendant and bring him to court for verification. The plaintiff obeyed the argument and retreated.</p>

Seeing that Zhang is quite beautiful, he tried to seduce her and soon fell in love. Su knew about it but endured it without saying anything. Zhang has a younger sister who is of age and often comes to her sister's house to play. The day before yesterday, the sister came again. It happened that Su was out for business. At around 11:00 pm, Su returned home. When he wanted to enter the room, he suddenly heard laughter coming from inside the room. He felt strange and peeked through the crack in the door. He saw his sister-in-law naked and bare, bathing in the bathtub. Shi was also teasing and performing all kinds of strange actions. Su was filled with jealousy when he saw it and became very angry. He immediately pushed the door open and twisted Shi. A big conflict arose. His sister-in-law jumped out of the bathtub, put on her clothes, and slipped away. The matter was heard by Zhang Wanxiang, a guard on duty at the 19th post. He rushed to the scene and brought the men and women to the first branch of the first district. After preliminary interrogation by the director, he ordered the men and women to be detained temporarily to await verification because they were both shameless.</p>

Li and others had originally planned to marry Zhou off to someone with the surname Wu in Wusong on the 19th of last month. Zhou only found out about this a few days prior and was very unwilling. Two days before the wedding date, Zhou secretly went out and hired a lawyer to draft a complaint against Li and Shen in the Special District Local Court, accusing them of restricting her freedom and requesting that they be punished according to Article 318 of the criminal law. The case will soon be opened for trial by the court.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Guan Chen, the madam of the Rui'an Lane No. 13, Aligre Road, French Concession, a brothel for young prostitutes, filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the French Court, stating that her establishment’s prostitute, Chen Ruifang, was forcibly abducted by a group of armed men last month. The next day, the defendant, Liu Fubao, sent someone to invite the madam to have tea at the Yile Tian Teahouse. He said that if she wanted the prostitute back, she would have to pay a reward of four hundred yuan before she could be released. At that time, the madam agreed to pay three hundred yuan, and the defendant agreed to hand over the person in seven days. Unexpectedly, the handover was repeatedly delayed. Therefore, she reported the matter and requested the arrest of Liu for investigation. Liu Fubao testified that the prostitute was the wife of a civilian friend, Wang Shengcai. He did not know how she was abducted by a gang, and there was no extortion involved. He requested a thorough investigation. The Chinese and Western officials instructed both parties to present their evidence. Liu was released on bail pending further investigation by the police and a subsequent review.</p>
