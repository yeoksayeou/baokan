<p>人增至三百萬以上金屬工人十餘萬因廠主提出减薪同盟罷工蓋經濟影響於政治而政治變動之反響復波及於經濟此種惶恐之景象蓋惟於一九二三年馬克跌落之時期内僅一見之在另一方面則歐洲各國眼見德國法西斯派之選舉勝利如夢初覺知大戰之不可避免外交之陰謀軍備之競爭遂有加而無已法意海軍談判之破裂巴爾幹局勢之緊張法國下年度軍事預算之增加多少皆受德國選舉之影響在此緊張之局勢中一般人所日夕盼念者即爲德國新國會召集後政局將如何渡過難關之一問題蓋白魯寗内閣在新國會中立脚點極不穏固苟左右兩側聯合進攻則非下臺不可但下臺以後德國政權將入何黨之手乎將出現右黨内閣乎抑將由社會民主黨重組聯立内閣乎無論向左向右皆與最近將來之國際局勢息息相關而爲吾人之急待分曉者也</p>
<p>今者此第一重難關却已打過白魯寗内閣雖僅佔國會中少數議席居然屹立而不倒此則一般人所未及意料者也自選舉結果發表以後白魯寗一方面與各黨領袖交換意見一方面則夷然自若整理財政計畫蓋德政府目前最緊急之問題爲預算之入不敷出因數月來德國工商停滯之結果國庫收入大見减削失業工人的維持費則有加無已因此本年度之預算短少自四百五十萬萬至六百萬萬馬克明年度則約短少十萬萬馬克國庫空虚羅掘無策此則任何政黨組織政府皆不免感到困難者白魯寗則主張撙節行政經費减少失業工人維持費他方面則向美銀團籌借短期外債藉以彌補一時此計畫决定以後則靜待國會之裁判</p>
<p>十月十三日新國會開幕一時人心惶惶柏林全巿無形戒嚴一百零七名之社會民主黨議員着棕色軍服偑卍字徽章（在普魯士此種制服在禁止之例惟國會内則無法取締）在議塲内呌嚣怒駡喧　不已是日午後有社會國民黨所雇打手多人在柏林商業區域内聚衆搗毁猶太人所開商舖之玻窗（社會國民黨對猶太人最烈希德婁說資本主義與共産主義皆猶太人所造之罪惡）被警察拘捕多人始漸散去當時人心惶恐彷彿革命將至至十五日國會選舉議長左右兩派競爭甚烈但最後結果歷任議長之社會民主黨議員羅白終得當選爲議長一般人視爲政府將獲勝利之前兆至十六日政府發表大政宣言歷述德國當前之危難及其救急之方策主張節流减政暫借外債以應目前之急需一方面則勸各黨暫棄黨見相安一時以渡過危急之關頭至在外交方面政府主張用平和方法求德意志民族之解放與國際待遇之平等但不主張冒險徼倖求逞於一時此政府宣言因措辭婉轉妥協頗爲中央各小黨及社會黨所贊許因此十七十八兩日國會爭辯雖非常劇烈十八日直至午夜會議始畢但社會國民黨共産黨及其他右黨提出之不信任政府案卒以三百十八票對二百三十六票之多數表决不列入議事日程國會則延會至十二月三日復開又各反對黨提出修爾凡爾賽條約案修改楊格計晝案連同政府之財政法案則均付委員會審查惟向外國銀團籌借一萬二千五百萬馬克短期外債之提案則以三百二十五對二百三十七票之多數通過</p>
<p>由是德國政局之難關可謂暫時過去此則全由於社會民主黨不願於目前倒閣之故蓋此次投票政府方面所得票數爲中央黨人民黨巴威略人民黨國家黨經濟黨所合成而社會黨獨佔一百四十餘票至反對黨方面則除社會國民黨共産黨德意志國民黨之與政府勢不兩立者外僅有農民黨加入因此政府乃竟將八十二票之多數不可謂不徼倖矣</p>
<p>至社會民主黨與中央派右傾各黨此次竭力擁護政府實因數月來德國政治經濟局勢日益危急如現政府倒墮政權不免落入極右派之手果然則政局前途將不堪設想因此各黨皆隠忍一時使現政府得安然渡過財政難關社會民主黨此舉實遭極大之犧牲蓋白魯寗内閣完全代表資産階級之利益此次發表之財政法案尤多於工人利益有損社會黨加以擁護實無異出賣社會黨所代表之工人階級但爲維持共和殘局避免右黨專政計則亦不得不有此策略也</p>
<p>但謂德國政局此後已將否極泰來則可謂適得其反蓋此次國會中之投票不過爲各黨之第一次交鋒政府雖徼倖獲得勝利然現政府之政策與國會中大多數政黨互相鑿枘十二月初國會復開時勢必有較更劇烈之爭辯現在暫時擱置之財政外交案彼時各黨各將根據自身利益而奮起力爭就吾人所見彼時白魯寗内閣必無倖免之希望果如是則德國政潮目前不過經四十餘日之休戰其終局如何則仍爲一大啞謎也</p>
<p>不寗唯是現政府雖得苟延殘喘而就此次選舉之趨勢一般人心之傾向德國外交政策必將改變面目斷不能遵循數年來之成規楊格計畫之延期支付凡爾賽條約之提議修改幾爲國會中各黨一致之要求政府自亦不能置之不問反之羅加諾協定與法德提携爲斯德萊斯曼之拿手好戲自今以後將不復爲德人所願聞夫如是則因德國選舉而造成之歐陸緊張空氣當不因此次德内閣之暫渡難關而遂得緩和也</p>
<p>總之今年冬季將爲一可注目之時期不但德國政局將於十二月間國會復開時定其進展之方向此外歐洲各主要國家亦無不然奥國現在進行選舉法西斯黨於下届國會中有大勝利之望英國工當政府尙有若干壽命將於下届議會中卜之至在法國則因德國選舉之結果右派亦逐漸抬頭此外急進黨正在進行倒閣可見二三月内歐洲各大國政局均將有重要之變化其影響於國際全局决不爲細小山雨欲來風満樓吾人其拭目俟之（十月二十日魯寄於巴黎）</p>

<p>我們就没有救中國救世界的革命原則没有中國國民黨我們就没有革命的領導機關没有中</p>
<p>華民國我們中國民族就没有脫離满淸政府的帝制壓迫因此總理的誕辰不但是中國民族的救星而且是世界一切被壓迫民族的救星總理誕辰不但中國民族應當慶祝與紀念就是全世界的人類也應當表示敬仰與紀念總理二十歲就决心革命四十年如一日精誠無間總理</p>
<p>一身自生至死可以說是一部救中國救世界的革命歷史由於總理一生的努力於是推翻了二百六十餘年根深蒂固的帝制基礎打破了帝國主義瓜分中國的迷夢樹立了中國革命成立的種子開展了世界革命的出路這些空前偉大的革命事業都是總理努力一生的表現因此中國國民革命得有今日的進展中國和平統一得有目前之樹立也都是總理偉大的精誠所感召這是我們要認淸的由於這個認識我們敢判斷一切反三民主義的反革命勢力無論是國内的閻馮汪等反革命勢力或是國外的赤白帝國主</p>
<p>義反革命勢力或是潛伏國内國外的一切反革命勢力他們將來只有出於奔潰消滅之途同時我們更敢判斷世界革命實以中國國民革命成功爲條件成功了中國革命就是成功了世界革命所以不但整個中國民族民衆要努力參加和完成國民革命就是世界一切被壓迫的民族民衆也應當努力參加和扶助中國國民革命革命的民衆們中國現在雖然已摧毁了封建軍閥的壓迫但是怎樣撫綏北方民衆安全全國民生以及一切的建設事業一樣都没有舉辦中國現在雖然已重睹和平統一的曙光但是赤白帝國主義的壓迫不平等條約的東　仍舊没有完全解除中國國民革命階毅現在已到了一個很危險很嚴重的時期在這個很危險很嚴重的時期裡面如果我們不能夠字隠的渡過那麽國民革命只有流産整個中國民族民衆的生命只有拉倒革命的民衆們革命是要求較好的生存的但是現在整個中國民族民衆不但求不到較好的生存而且固有的生存也被侵略的帝國主義者國際的經濟壓迫得動彈不得所以我們今後的革命對象就要對準帝國主義者要從帝國主義者壓迫之下掙脫出來廢除一切不平等條約同時我們更知道革命是建設的不是破壞的是爲建設而破壞的不是爲破壞而破壞的所以在和平統一重見曙光的現在我們只有努力建設事業朝　非資本主義的建設路上走我們尤其在努力促進和完成建設事業中最重要的地方自治革命的民衆們破壞難建設更難我們能不能渡過目前這個難關就看我們能不能</p>
<p>擔得起建設的重任我們能不能完成中國國民革命乃至世界革命也就看我們能不能努力完成中國最艱難最繁重的建設事業我們的口號（一）慶祝總理誕辰（二）打倒赤白帝國主義（三）廢除一切不平等條約（四）槍斃閣锡山馮玉祥汪精衛（五）擁護總司令（六）努力訓政建設（七）總理精神不死（八）中國國民黨萬歲（九）中華民國萬歲（十）國民革命成功萬歲中國國民黨上黨特别巿執行委員會</p>

<p>國民社云宣阿香案近頗爲滬人所在意茲據司法部法醫檢騐所籌備主任孫逵方君詳述檢騐眞相如次</p>
<h3 id="c127">法醫之性質與責任 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>近來滬上各報紛載宣阿香案法醫檢騐情形頗失事實眞相並關於逵方個人及法醫檢騐處有種種誤會在法醫學未甚昌明之我國傅聞失實本不足奇個人毀　亦不足辯惟念我國法醫事業方在萌芽當局銳意改良並在眞茹設立法醫研究所以期立法醫事業之基前途發展正未可量若社會對於法醫首先失其信仰則於改良司法前途關係甚大是用不憚煩瑣將此案檢騐經過詳細叙述俾通曉法醫者得予以適當之批評不明法醫者亦不致過昧於眞相凡一新學術之傅人新事業之興起每不免受相當阻力即以普通醫學而論今日西醫在國内之勢力尙遠在舊醫以下矧法醫之事傅入尤遲羣疑衆惑固無足怪所望社會人士就實在之事實作冷靜之評判勿轉爲流言浮說所動則司法改良之前途庶不致過受阻礙而我國檢騐事務不致長受洗寃錄與仵作制度之支配耳科學研究</p>
<p>首重證據法醫方法亦以身體上之證據爲主由身體上之證據可以推測死因然同一死因可由種種行爲種種方法以逹之究竟眞正致傷或致死之行爲方法爲何則須參酌身體以外之人證物證以推定之如證人所舉之行爲事實可以逹到鑒定之死因而對於身體各部份之徵象皆能說明而無矛盾則法醫可解釋其證據爲近理然亦不能必謂其絕對屬實因身體以外之證據是否眞實自有司偵查鑒定之人爲之負責非法醫主管之範圍不過如與各種徵象皆能符合自足構成極强之證據而已反之如證人所舉之情形無論如何不能構成法醫所鑒定之死因則法醫不能不設想有其他行爲以作近於情</p>
<p>理之解釋至其他行爲之有無其證據又須其一爲根據身體上之現象以斷定死因此完全爲法醫本身範圍之事其二爲以法庭上所得身體以外之證據與身體上所騐得之徵象相綜合而推定致死之行爲下一合理之解釋此則非完全屬於法醫本身之範圍因身體以外其他證據之偵查搜集並非法醫分内之事法醫不過能判别此種證據是否能與死因相連貫而下一種解釋俾法庭有一種參攷偵查有一種指針而已若初次偵查之時法庭有未知之事實因之死因不能解釋則法醫不得不揣測證據之外尙有他種行爲迨其後新事實發見可以逹到死因而同時又無其他足以構成死因之行爲以爲反證則法醫可以根據新得之事實而改其解釋但使死因不謬則法醫之鑒定不能謂之錯誤因法醫不能懸揣法庭將有新證據之發現而預先爲解釋在未有新證以前不能不作其他近情之解釋也法醫學亦有一著名案件足以釋明法醫之地位自刎與他殺之刀痕普通有明顯之區别自刎之刀痕斜行由上而下其方向爲由左傾右此普通之徵象也某次有人死於臥室其頸上之痕正與此同由法醫學之眼光觀之作自刎之解釋最爲正當因之當時之法醫先即作此鑒定嗣更經詳細偵查見刀上之指紋與死者之指紋不符而棄刀之處與屍身之距離過遠亦有可疑之處因之由偵查人員根據指紋訪緝兇手幸獲捕得詢其當時殺害之情形則被殺者方俯首蹲於前方而殺人者曲身於其身後殺之其傷痕之狀况用能完全與自殺相似於是法醫不能不改其解釋然此種前後兩歧之解釋與其謂爲有損法醫學之價値毋寧謂爲足以增高其聲價故解釋之更改不足爲病所貴者惟在死因之鑒定與現象相合耳</p>

<p>— 妍千</p>
<p>最近上海社會創見一新穎事業即靑年會之讀書運動是也昨日爲開幕之第一日有胡適之先生演講爲什麽要讀書茲將胡先生演講及趣屑略記之以餉本談讀者</p>
<p>向隅者衝鋒　作者去時爲下午三點鐘見辦事處櫃前圍满一大羣人因即上前探問始知入塲已發送一空衆方在要求通融也其時距開始演講時刻尙有兩點鐘而來者均已抱向隅之嘆亦可見其事之轟動社會與夫胡先生之號召力矣後我至者至四點三刻尙絡繹不絕因此會中職員屢屢被向隅者包圍迺卒以（待持券者坐满後再行開放以納向隅諸君）一語解圍焉然向隅者多不願久待逕欲奪門而入守門者亦力拒不放於是向隅之羣衆臨時團結相約衝鋒一時（用力啊）（衝啊）之聲不絕於耳最後竟獲勝和一閧入塲作者藉前進後推者之力亦趁勢而入其時勝利的歡笑又代努力之聲而起此或讀書界此後勇猛精進之先兆乎</p>
<p>讀書三點　五點正胡先生於唱黨歌行禮靜默等儀式畢後起立演講先致謙詞謂敎我講怎様讀書或讀什麽書倒很可講講這爲什麽要讀書却有些難了恐怕講得不好現在姑且來試試次謂關於這問題我曾經有過一回演講那稿子恰好收在胡適文存三集裏諸位先生不妨去參考參考然後入題講演大意爲讀書有三點一書本是學問智識經騐之紀錄人類之遺産讀書就是要接受這部遺産來做基礎再去發揮而光大之二是爲讀書而讀書因爲人類有讀書的必要所以才讀書讀書多則所能讀的書愈多三是爲解决困難而讀書困難當前就得去思想思想才能發生主意有了主意才好選擇一個適合的主義去解决困難如果不讀書就不會有主意多讀書主意自然會多解决困難亦就比較容易胡先生說時引證甚多大有頭頭是道水到渠成之槪故歷時甚久</p>
<p>雜貨店中半打貨　最後胡先生又說先已聲明在前講起來或許要侵到其他預定的講題現在要貢獻一點意見就是我們怎様來讀書呢我讀了三十五年的書了但這三十五年的經騐告訴我中國所有汗牛充棟的書很少是有系統有結搆的都是漫無計畫隨便集成功的所謂經史子集集是雜貨店是很明顯的然而子又何嘗不是雜貨店史與經又何嘗不是雜貨店呢因爲是雜貨店所以眞正有系統人結搆的很少至多只不過半打是夠得上前面的條件的因此我們單讀中國書就覺得不夠所以至少要學一種外國文字才可以收博覽羣集觸類旁通之效如果學者能下一年的苦功不怕麻煩查生字辨句讀一字字一句句都弄得非常淸楚就會有很好的成績再繼續不斷的用功必有一天給你在睡榻上也好看外國書不費氣力地看外國書那才是讀書之樂樂無窮𥆁至此胡先生就於掌聲四起中鞠躬而退</p>

<p>汽車改裝鐵輪　用代要人專車</p>
<p>要人進出每開專車軍事</p>
<p>時期更無論矣蓋恐時間關係致誤國家大事吾人固不能深責當局之非是也然火車開支浩大所費實屬可觀鄙意可以汽車改裝鐵輪置於鐵道之上仍用汽車引擎發動則行駛速而費省矣如每次專車所耗爲百元若改用汽車所費爲十元以此計之則可省百份之十積少成多要亦經濟之大道也</p>

<p>十一月一日表弟沈逹時君由盧晋侯博士及劉樹梅先生之介與合淝李翰章氏之孫女公子李國綺女士假大華飯店結婚晚間設宴於新酒樓重要人物紛來觀禮極一時之盛因將所見趣話錄之以實本談</p>
<p>莊嚴燦爛之禮堂　禮堂中花籃二十餘對满置兩旁中置銀屏銀盾等物後爲音樂臺前爲來賓席當舉行婚禮時禮堂承塵燈火齊明一若满天星斗燦爛可觀來賓靜坐其中不啻身入天宮矣</p>

<p>— 凌黛</p>
<p>一九三○年諾貝爾文學基金底得者已於十一月五日公布了這是誰這是美國小說家新格拉路威士（Sinclair　Lewis)</p>
<p>在前幾天在這消息未曾公布之前本年度諾貝爾文學獎金底候選人中之最有希望者據新聞紙上的報告說是美國的德蘭散（Theodore　Dreiser)和新近加入了法蘭西學士院阿加特梅　的詩哲保爾·哇拉梨（PauI　VeIery)但這回公布的消息與新聞記者的神經過敏的記戴逈不相同這位新近獲得世界文學最高榮譽的路威士不妨讓我簡單地來說一說他的來歷吧</p>
<p>諾貝爾文學獎金始於一九○○年今年却是第三十次在過去的三十次中其得到此隆高之榮譽者爲五個日耳曼人五個法蘭西人兩個英吉利人三個諾威人兩個瑞典人丹麥人意大利人西班牙人及波蘭人一個愛爾蘭人瑞士人比利時人及印度人</p>
<p>從過去三十次得獎者的國籍中我們看見只有一個是屬於所謂被壓迫的民族有色人種的那便是印度的泰谷爾在這個表計中我們不曾看見那在世界經濟並政治上擁有霸權的美國籍的文學者底獲選我們或者可以將這個事實認謂是歐洲的向來對於美國的輕視或者我們可以將它的解釋置在另一方面而以美國人的專力於物質的或機的享用底增廣而忽略於文學及藝術的素養但關於這些解釋實是不中肯的</p>
<p>其實如就文學及藝術底本身則其發展以至於繁華必伴隨以經濟的發展與繁華此我們在文學史上是很可以見到的例如伊利沙伯朝之爲英國文學史上的黄金時代其所以繁榮正因爲在那時各處新殖民地底經營使它的財富增加而有經濟的繁榮意大利的波卡旭阿西班牙的賽爾凡的斯等等都可以其時經濟的關係論定的其最特色的一點便是第一時代的經濟型狀可以决定某一時代的文學底内容與其特微例如波卡旭阿的十月談是只有在商業主義時代才會有的在商業主義未發逹以前的神官主義的封建時代是决不會發生的</p>
<p>世界經濟今日的霸權已由那以纖維工業爲基本的英國移轉到那鋼鐵工業爲基本的美國故凡在政治上英國的傅統的海上威權政策無論她的殖民地或領士是如何廣溢不得不因經濟情形底轉變而唱英美侮力平等的高調當然伴隨着這經濟局面的展開的　必有藝術與文學的展開</p>
<p>關於這歷史上的劃期我們可以羅斯福的當選爲大總統來分斷自羅斯福以後美國的經濟的及政治的權力自益繁榮同時美國亦於藝術及文學上有了新的供獻但這種政治的經濟的及文化的雄力到凡爾賽以後才逐漸引起世人的注意直到最後才將這隆高的文學獎贈與美國的小說家新格拉路威士　第一個美國文學者得到此項諾貝爾文學獎金</p>
<p>瑞典學士院之給諾貝爾文學獎金與向來被人輕視的美國文學者至少（或者神經過敏一點）具有下列的意義</p>
<p>（一）美國政治的及經濟的霸權旣日益隆起爲外交的或國際關係的考慮現在將這尊貴的文學獎金贈與美國文學者正得其時這背後是此項文學獎金的給予含有某種政治的意味（其實去年的文學獎金之所以給予湯馬斯曼（日耳曼文學者）亦可以說含有某種政治的意味的）（二）伴隨着美國經濟的展開而有的美國文學的形式·格調·與内容已被一般的注意與認可不得不承認美國在世界文學上的地位</p>
<p>現在不防讓我略爲介紹一番路威士底生平新格拉路威士是於一八八五年生在一個小小的朋尼蘇達州的城巿中從小便沈浸在美國西部的小城巿的小資産階級的零圍氣中朋尼蘇達州在美國的西北部地當密西西比河的上流氣候早寒又是一塊極大的平原故他的冷酷的筆風或者就在這種環境中養成他後來進了東方的耶魯大學於一九○七年取得了文學士的學位自他從大學畢業以後便在大學所在地紐海芬的一家報館中充當一名記者又在舊金山的報紙（蒲勃登）”BuIIetin“及聯合通信社（AssociatedPress)充當記者嗣後爲大西洋小說（TranstIanticTaIes)浮爾泰評論（VoItaReview)等雜誌編輯後又在出版家桃蘭公司（GeorgeHDoranCc)充當編輯</p>
<p>他的第一部小說是在一九一四年發行的（我們的雷恩先生）（“OurMrWrenn”)但他的出名的關鍵是那本（大街）（”MainStreet“)</p>
<p>在（大街）出版後於一九二二年又出版了“Babbitt”其後一九二七年的“EImerGantrry”更受到一般的注意在書内他更極力抨擊美國敎士們的虚僞此外其他的作品有“ArrOwsInith”“TbeMeeWhoKnewCooIidge”“Mantrap”“Dodswortb”等他也曾作過劇本他的Hobohenia於一九一九年演於紐約</p>
<p>在路威士的小說内我們可以看見他的筆風宛轉而有力陰冷酷而靈巧在美國文學中實倡出了一種新的格調足與愛倫坡威脫曼後先輝映他的小說當然是很盛行的</p>

<p>三卷十二三期</p>
<p>（草野周刋）的内容在最近出版的兩期中最顯出它底精采與充實本來積極地努力發揚民族主義文藝的創作與詩歌的在小小的一張周刋中我們唯有首推已具悠久歷史的（草野）了第十二期上所刋湯增　底比較梢些起點的詩在思想上毌須說是已緊握着民族主義的中心在詩的藝術上所表現的觀照這兩詩的全部却是異常的緊凑這就所謂詩底技巧了現在將這兩詩的内容精密的解剖一下籍此窺視出詩人所具的有力的指示</p>
<p>第一首詩是題名（來吧革命的兄弟）但是祗在看這個命名便使我們讀者感到一股雄渾激昂的氣燄大有跟隨着一般爲革命而奮門的兄弟們聚合起來衝向前去之勢這當然是爲我們整個的中華民族的爭自由而突起的一種革命的戰門</p>
<p>全詩計分十一節作者是把足以用詩的藝來發揚民族主義文藝的爲這詩的主要題材用總合法把許多値得表現的散漫不覊的形形式式附加上美底原素寫成這様一首緊凑而連貫的詩篇每一節裏大都是以鼓勵（革命的兄弟）爲中華民族的爭光榮而起一種偉大的奮門這當然應該不屈不撓的邁進簡單的說這詩底全部是以（鼓勵革命者）爲中心其次又憑着作者𤍠烈的情緖豐富的想像刻畫着許多應該洗去的有礙民族前途發展的殘痕毫不遲疑地須脫下灰色頽廢的衣裳消滅萎靡不振的哀傷尤其是要具有向上奮門的毅勇的一顆心同時又必須怎樣地衝破敵類的屏障怎樣築起我們爲國戰爭的自禦的營壘這種有力的叙述法是輔佐中心思想所表現底不足這首詩概括地說一句確具有民族主義詩學上必備的幾種條件的了現將前兩節徵引於下使讀者明白全詩底雄放而激壯的呢</p>

<p>在很短的詩句中表現得這樣的有力實屬不易以下幾節都是靈活可喜爲了本刋的篇幅關係故不一一徵引不過在努力發揚民族主義文𦿳的現今像作這�</p>
<p>樣描寫戰塲上種種情狀的詩歌我們是非常地急迫地需要多量地在（草野）上與我們愛好詩歌者相見</p>

<p>草野社出版</p>
<p>最近的中國創作界似乎漸漸地勃興而消沉了下來因爲現今各個新書業大都注意到大中學各種學科的讀本與及一般兒童的文學讀物所以長短篇的創作是很少與我們讀者見面的了然而金寛生君的（婚前小記）就在這樣似乎沉寂的中國創作界中驀然地突現於我們的眼　之前了這實是一件極可欣喜的事尤其是我們愛讀文藝作品的</p>
<p>金君這書是一種日記式的體裁文字極其自然流利我們將它每段分開來讀却是很多篇的含有永雋意味的散文如果把它連貫起來一口氣讀完的時候那麽便成爲一篇日記式的中篇創作了實際這樣的分段來記述無論在文筆上或是取意上都容易顯現出作者特具的優長來這本（婚前小記）在文章的細微處可以看出作者是眞實的描寫一點没有處飾的空的痕跡表露於字句行開</p>
<p>作者將他自巳在愛史之中的值得紀念的一頁一點也不掩飾的寫了下來作者所以訂婚實在是爲了愛憐蔣女士的身世和安慰父母的老境現在我們先來看他下面的所記</p>
<p>我年紀不小了父母的担負一些没有卸去長子二十四歲（廢歷）還没有訂親做父母的很盼望兒子娶親成人我的靑年已經過去我𤍠烈的靑春之火已將滅熄我的時代再不能愛少女了少女爲我是增愁加煩的材料少女們能誤我偉大的前程我的時代應當克苦求學修飬才能預備供獻於人類爲社會謀幸福爲國家增榮光的…我得到過幾個少女幾個少女的經過是有始有終嗎幾個少女徒然化用了過量的金錢…甜密的回憶增添了苦悶時更深一層的苦而不免在夜半捫心自省時又慚愧又自恨我答應了父母的訂婚我就有正當的歸處</p>
<p>我們看了上面的一節可以知道作者自已對於過去的愛的懺悔同時還企望着自巳的前途發揚光大所以他與蔣女士的訂婚是求正當的歸宿這些都是眞情流露的詞句下面是描寫他底未婚妻的身世</p>
<p>她的境况苦於我十一歲的時候慈母見背一直到十九歲過着學校生活幸而父親愛她不至於十分受苦…她受家庭拘束受後母白眼她没有姊妹兄弟談笑她又没有姨母可以訴苦從十九歲那年她做敎員了短小的年紀未經世故的少女伶仃狐苦獨言獨語誰是她的安慰敎員生活她是相稱而盡職的孤苦愁悶絕境中得到一綫光明</p>
<p>由此兩節也可以窺視出作者同情於未婚妻的凄凉的身世這種動人的情景作者都赤裸裸地表現在我們的眼前了</p>
<p>這册書印得很美麗實可作婚前的紀念物在内容上也有許多新的記述</p>

<h3 id="e16">The American Election <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of political warfare, the political parties of all countries must put forward the policies of their party and make every effort to promote them, saying how their policies will stabilize people's livelihoods and how to consolidate the national foundation, what financial methods there are, and how various industries will progress. Their words have never failed to be eloquent. However, once they win and hold political power, the policies they have put forward often fail to be fully realized in reality. It is true that there are those who are limited by environmental difficulties and cannot implement their policies, but the majority have already forgotten their declared responsibilities after gaining political power, and what they strive for day and night is for individuals rather than for the public, and in decoration rather than being realistic. The people see that there is no practice of their declaration, so what they hoped for turns into resentment and belief is lost. The opposing party takes advantage of it, and the political warfare is revived. No matter what kind of political warfare in the world, the cycle repeats itself, and the origin is no different. Therefore, after winning, being able to do one's best to defend one's claims, using one's loyalty and wisdom to implement one's policies, and sincerely seeking the interests of the country and removing the suffering of the people, the people will surely be enlightened that their policies are for the public and not private, for the truth and not false. What they believed in before, their belief will naturally not be replaced, and even those who did not believe in it will follow and believe in it. In general, no matter what kind of good policy, only by implementing it with a loyal and truthful heart and dealing with it with sincere and unpretentious efforts can it be permanently victorious and without defeat. This is also a common example in the world. The reason why the Democratic Party was able to rise and compete with the Republican Party in this election and is about to surpass it is also because the policies put forward by the Republican Party have failed to be realized, and the people's belief in them has gradually decreased. However, it is not yet known whether the cooperative policy announced by the Democratic Party today can be realized.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Praying for Peace: Huang Fu <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Hopes for the Fourth Plenary Session and a Review of the Washington Conference</p>
<p>The last World War ended on November 11, 1918. Therefore, since the Paris Peace Conference, every country has a commemoration on this day, called Peace Memorial Day, to record the tragedy of war and celebrate the joy of peace. Thinking of the past after pain, remembering the past to warn the future, the meaning is far-reaching. The Washington Conference was held ten years ago on November 12. The day before, the opening ceremony was the World Peace Memorial Day. The American government invited the members of the delegation of various countries participating in the Washington Conference and the important people of the countries related to the European War to hold a national funeral for anonymous heroes at the National Cemetery in the southwestern suburbs of Washington. An anonymous hero is one chosen from the battlefield to represent the spirits of all the fallen soldiers of the country. Welcomed back to the national burial, the American government sent General Perishing, the commander of the American army during the European War, to preside over the matter. This body, of course, cannot be named, so it is named anonymous hero. At that time, the reporter was able to personally participate in the event. On that day, the number of people participating inside and outside the site was more than 100,000, including women wearing black gauze and red tears in their eyes crying for their sons and husbands, which was really unbearable to look at. After the ceremony, all the important people made extremely painful speeches, generally saying that the phenomenon of national grief we see today shows that the current ray of hope for peace was exchanged for the countless losses and endless tragedies of the world directly and indirectly in the past four years. Therefore, we should cherish and maintain this ray of hope for peace and not let it be covered by haze again. Today, we choose this World Peace Memorial Day to bury our national scholars in order to remember the painful history of the past. We also choose to open the naval disarmament conference tomorrow, hoping to ensure lasting peace in the future. Only by having the extreme pain of the past can we feel the need to ensure peace in the future. Only by ensuring peace in the future can we comfort the sacrifices of the painful past. Alas, how painful the words and how profound the meaning! Therefore, throughout the period of the Washington Conference, the United States, both nationally and universally, unanimously and sincerely supported the success of the disarmament conference, and the participating countries were also able to understand this intention and abandon small differences to achieve great unity. Therefore, the Washington Conference treaty was finally completed.</p>
<p>This year, domestic wars broke out. The length of the battle line in modern world war history is incomparable except for the European War. The intensity of the war is also rare in the history of internal wars. The total number of deaths and injuries on both sides reached as many as 300,000, and the casualties and displacements of the people in the war zone should be ten times more than this. The total amount of military expenditure on both sides reached more than 200 million yuan, and the indirect losses of the people in various places should be tens of times more than this. According to experts, the railway transportation item said that the total amount of operating losses and damage losses of vehicles and tracks should be between 60 and 70 million yuan. Among agricultural products, the tobacco item said that the three provinces of Yu, Lu, and Wan were in the midst of fierce fighting during the tobacco harvest season, and the losses should be between 20 million and 30 million yuan. Other Zhongxing Coal Mine along Jinpu Line and Liuhegou Coal Mine along Pinghan Line were both due to frequent military transportation, and there were few vehicles for transporting goods for almost half a year. In addition, the front-line military affairs were urgent, and the Communist Party and bandits in the rear colluded with each other to take advantage of the opportunity to make trouble, killing, arson, slaughtering cities and looting things. The sound of looting was spread all over the place, especially in the three provinces of Xiang, E, and Gan. According to those who escaped from the dead, the situation was as tragic as the war zone, and the amount of losses was greater than the war expenses. Alas, since the end of the former Qing Dynasty, we have suffered a great blow from foreign powers in the Sino-Japanese War and the Boxer Indemnity, and have been affected by more than 20 years of intermittent civil wars. The national finance and social economy have been exhausted, and the national power has been as weak as a candle in the wind. The reason why it has not been extinguished is because it has to put down all development policies and live an extremely negative and lingering life. It is clear that the industry is backward but has no power to develop it. It is clear that education is backward but has no power to popularize it. It is clear that the land and water transportation is not ready but has no power to revitalize it. Can we still bear this great sacrifice? If we use the millions of soldiers and civilians who died, were injured and displaced due to the war to fill the labor of construction undertakings, and use the tens of thousands of financial resources directly and indirectly lost due to the war to fill the expenses of construction undertakings, I dare say that Premier Sun Yat-sen's plan for 200,000 miles of railways and the projects of the two major ports in the north and south have been realized at least by more than half. Thinking of this, I cannot but feel heartbroken and angry at those who lightly speak of starting wars and arbitrarily provoking them. Now that the military has ended and reunification has been declared, the people of the country are lightly inflicting this extreme pain. I sincerely hope that the ruling and opposition parties will jointly realize the importance of maintaining the unity of the country in order to obtain lasting peace. I especially hope that all the soldiers of the country will deeply remember Chairman Chiang's speech at the National Government Memorial Week on October 13, "This kind of major sacrifice, whether for the enemy or for us, is always the people of the Republic of China." Therefore, after the victory, there is no way to comfort the dead and the heroic souls (British Prime Minister MacDonald recently proposed not to offer flower wreaths to the tombs of anonymous heroes to increase the enemy's hatred for each other, which is a burden for international peace in the future. Then, the enemy's hatred in foreign countries must be eliminated by means, and the enemy's hatred among compatriots can be allowed to exist?), and I cannot bear to spread the banquet of triumph for the living, and the material losses of each other are all the vitality of the Republic of China, and there is no compensation for the indemnity. Therefore, the hidden pain in our hearts today should be tens of times greater than the psychology of the Allied nations after the European War. It has been reported in the newspapers for many days that the Central Government will convene the Fourth Plenary Session on the 12th of this month, which coincides with the opening day of the Washington Conference. They held the meeting for world peace after the war, and we also held the meeting for national peace after the war. The intention is completely the same. It is also recorded that Zhang Xueliang, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, will arrive in Nanjing on the day before, that is, World Peace Memorial Day, to prepare to visit the mausoleum of Premier Sun Yat-sen, which is similar to the situation of holding the national funeral for anonymous heroes the day before the opening of the Washington Conference. When we think about it, we dare to make a temporary suggestion to the officials of the authorities with the qualification of a citizen of the Republic of China, with an extremely faithful and enthusiastic attitude. Commander Chiang, Deputy Commander Zhang, and the members of the Fourth Plenary Session should visit the mausoleum of Premier Sun Yat-sen together on the 11th to report the reunification of the country and the return to peace, and vow in front of the mausoleum that the people who are the same as the Fourth Plenary Session will build the foundation of unity for the country and establish the foundation of peace forever, based on the model of Premier Sun Yat-sen's legacy of love and sincerity, and with the hardships of the people suffering from the hardships of the people. Also, it is hoped that the 11th of November every year will be designated as Double Eleven Festival, and the Central Committee members will hold a mausoleum visit ceremony, using the two phrases "Establish the foundation of unity and establish the foundation of peace forever" as the standard to make a general report on the political process of the year to comfort Premier Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven. If this kind of spirit can be cultivated to maturity and become popular throughout the country, it is expected that in the future, if there are any more people who violate unity and destroy peace, they will not only be traitors of Premier Sun Yat-sen, but also public enemies of the people. Alas, past events are not to be said, but the future can be pursued. If the country is able to be sincere for the country, no matter whether it is in power or in the opposition, we have the room to work hard everywhere. I hope that we will consider the country that is about to die and the strength of the people that is about to be exhausted, and jointly align our steps towards the path of peace and unity to move forward.</p>

<p>Nanjing: Railway Vice Minister Li Zhaohuan is scheduled to go to Shanghai on the 10th to take up the position of President of Jiaotong University. He hosted a press conference on the afternoon of the 9th and reported: (1) The railway lines have been greatly affected by the military situation, with damaged tracks and reduced revenues, resulting in considerable losses. Now that the railway rights have been unified, active reorganization is underway. The steps of reorganization will first start with debt, so that economic independence and all railway policies can be newly constructed. (2) To build railway policies, we must first cultivate talents. Jiaotong University, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Railways, is the main pivot for implementing railway policy education, and is divided into three types of education: university, middle school, and worker. The various colleges set up in Shanghai, Tangshan, and Beiping schools either study higher subjects or practice management affairs, and the equipment still needs to be expanded. Worker education should be given special attention, because the knowledge of the industry is weak and it is easy to be used by others, so we must use education to correct their concepts. In short, the transportation industry takes railway policy as the first priority, and the construction of railway policy takes talent as the foundation. This is the basic policy of the Ministry of Railways, and this is what I will strive to do after arriving at the school. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Ultimately Vetoed by the Preparatory Commission for Disarmament</p>
<p>Geneva, August 8 (National News Agency) The motion submitted by Germany to restrict the reserve forces of the army and navy was vetoed by the Preparatory Commission for Disarmament today. Among the thirty-two countries present, only Germany, China, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway and other six countries voted in favor. France, Italy, Japan, Belgium, Spain and other twelve countries voted against it, while the remaining thirteen countries including Britain, the United States, Canada and other countries abstained from voting. After the results were announced, the German representative stood up and declared that Germany regarded this motion as a touchstone for restricting armaments in the draft disarmament agreement. Now that the result is like this, no further votes will be cast on any amendments to this article. In addition, during the previous discussions, only the Russian representative Litvinov made a speech in favor of the motion. Representatives from France, Japan and Italy strongly opposed it, while the British representative Cecil only spoke briefly and did not take sides.</p>
<p>Geneva, August 8 (Reuters) The Preparatory Commission for Disarmament today rejected the amendment proposed by Germany regarding the first provision of the Disarmament Convention by a vote of twelve to six.

<p>Wushe, September 9 (Teletong) The body of Hanoka Ichiro, who hanged himself in the eastern forest of the Hogo Aboriginal Community, was discovered yesterday. He was wearing formal attire. The aboriginals' tactics are extremely clever. The day before yesterday, they actually raised a white flag and approached the Japanese army. They suddenly launched a surprise attack. The Japanese army was able to repel them because they had machine guns, but it was extremely dangerous. According to captured aboriginals, the tribal chief Manao Rudao quarreled with his wife and ordered her to commit suicide. When his wife refused, he shot her. Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, Japanese reconnaissance aircraft dropped four bombs into the Masher Creek Valley. The aboriginals emerged from the caves, covered themselves with dead grass, and lay on the small mountains, taking aim at the Japanese expeditionary force.</p>

<p>Public Panic Intensifies</p>

<p>Paris, August 8 (National News Agency) Since the Adam Bank suspended payments, panic has intensified among the French people. Rumors have spread, and all banks across the country have experienced runs on deposits. Even the major banks in the capital are not exempt. Today, tens of millions of francs were withdrawn from the Lyons Loan Bank. Three motions for inquiry have been submitted to the National Assembly. Financial leaders are now urging the government to provide prompt relief and are expected to enact legislation to merge Adam Bank with the Northern Loan Bank so that depositors can be repaid in full. Asterick Bank, which closed on Wednesday, is expected to repay 75% of its depositors. Paris, August 8 The Commercial Court today granted judicial liquidation to Asterick Bank after hearing statements from the bank's founders and chairman. The so-called judicial liquidation is an investigation of the bank's assets, debts, and proportional repayment without declaring the bank actually bankrupt.</p>

<p>Vienna, August 8 (National News Agency) The current Austrian election is one of the most important since the European War. The intensity of propaganda from all parties has never been seen before. Yesterday alone, airplanes, balloons, loudspeakers, and all sorts of imaginable methods were used, leading to very high public emotions. In the evening, many civil police conflicts occurred in various places, and even the deployment of troops was necessary to suppress them. It is still unprecedented in Austrian history for political propaganda to lead to riots. Among the fourteen parties competing in this election, the Social Democratic Party and the middle-class group led by former Prime Minister Schober and the quasi-fascist Heimwehr are the most fiercely competitive. The Heimwehr is confident that it will make a sensation this time like the National Socialist Party of Germany. Its leader, the current Minister of the Interior, Prince Starhemberg, has even repeatedly stated that regardless of the election results, the party will never relinquish political power. Currently, the group is shouting slogans everywhere to overthrow Marxism, while the opposing Social Democratic Party is shouting slogans to overthrow fascism and is confident that it can also win a major victory.</p>

It is expected that at least three seats will be changed, namely Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden, First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander, and Secretary of State for India Benn, who are all accused of reactionary tendencies and opposing borrowing to relieve unemployment.</p>

<p>Tension at the Opening of the National Assembly</p>
<p>The Brüning Government Barely Survives</p>
<p>The National Assembly is Postponed Until Early December</p>
<p>This Winter Will Be an Eventful Season</p>
<p>Special European Correspondent The German political situation after the election and its impact on world politics have already been described in my previous communication. Since the results of the German election were announced, the mood in all European countries has been anxious and unsettled. On the one hand, the internal economic panic in Germany has reached its extreme. Due to fears of sudden changes in the political situation, the financial community has transferred capital to foreign countries to seek safety. Stock market prices have plummeted, and the number of unemployed workers has increased to more than three million. More than 100,000 metal workers have gone on strike because factory owners have proposed wage cuts. The economic impact on politics and the repercussions of political changes have once again affected the economy. This kind of panic scene was only seen once before during the period of the mark's fall in 1923. On the other hand, the victory of the German fascists in the election was like a dream for European countries, who suddenly realized that war was inevitable. Diplomatic conspiracies and competition for armaments have increased without end. The breakdown of the French-Italian naval negotiations, the tense situation in the Balkans, and the increase in France's military budget for the next year were all influenced by the German election to some extent. In this tense situation, what people are hoping for day and night is the question of how the political situation will get through the difficulties after the convocation of the new German National Assembly. The Brüning cabinet has an extremely unstable foothold in the new National Assembly. If the left and right sides jointly attack, it will inevitably fall. But after the fall, into whose hands will German power fall? Will a right-wing cabinet appear, or will the Social Democratic Party reorganize the joint cabinet? Whether it leans to the left or the right is closely related to the international situation in the near future and is what we urgently need to understand.</p>
<p>Now, this first difficult hurdle has been overcome. Although the Brüning cabinet occupies only a minority of seats in the National Assembly, it actually stands firmly without falling. This is something that people did not expect. Since the announcement of the election results, Brüning has exchanged views with the leaders of various parties on the one hand, and has calmly reorganized the financial plan on the other. The most urgent problem for the German government at present is the deficit in the budget. As a result of the stagnation of German industry and commerce in recent months, the national treasury's income has greatly decreased, while the maintenance costs for unemployed workers have increased. Therefore, the budget shortage for this year ranges from 4.5 billion to 6 billion marks, and for the next year, it will be about 1 billion marks. The national treasury is empty and there is no way to raise funds. Any political party forming a government will inevitably feel this difficulty. Brüning advocates economizing on administrative expenses and reducing maintenance costs for unemployed workers. On the other hand, he is borrowing short-term foreign debt from American banking groups in order to make up for it temporarily. After this plan is decided, we will wait quietly for the National Assembly's verdict.</p>
<p>On October 13, the new National Assembly opened. The people were alarmed for a time. Berlin was under intangible martial law throughout the city. One hundred and seven Social Democratic Party members wearing brown uniforms with swastika badges (this kind of uniform is prohibited in Prussia, but there is no way to ban it inside the National Assembly) were clamoring and shouting endlessly in the assembly hall. On the afternoon of that day, many thugs hired by the Social National Party gathered in the commercial area of Berlin and smashed the glass windows of shops opened by Jews (the Social National Party is the most violent against Jews. Hitler said that both capitalism and communism are crimes created by Jews). Many people were arrested by the police before they gradually dispersed. At that time, the people were panicked, as if a revolution was about to break out. On the 15th, when the National Assembly elected the speaker, the left and right factions competed fiercely, but in the end, Luo Bai, a Social Democratic Party member who had served as speaker for many years, was finally elected as speaker. People generally regarded this as a harbinger of the government's victory. On the 16th, the government issued a policy declaration, outlining the current difficulties in Germany and its emergency relief measures, advocating streamlining and reducing administration, and temporarily borrowing foreign debt to meet the current urgent needs. On the other hand, it urged the various parties to temporarily abandon their partisan views and get along with each other for a while in order to get through the crisis. As for foreign affairs, the government advocated using peaceful methods to seek the liberation of the German nation and equal international treatment, but did not advocate taking risks to seek temporary success. This government declaration was praised by the central small parties and the Social Party because of its euphemistic and compromising wording. Therefore, although the debate in the National Assembly on the 17th and 18th was very fierce, the meeting on the 18th did not end until midnight, but the motion of no confidence in the government proposed by the Social National Party, the Communist Party, and other right-wing parties was ultimately voted down by a majority of 318 votes to 236 votes and was not included on the agenda. The National Assembly was postponed until December 3. The financial bills of the Anti-Versailles Treaty proposed by various opposition parties and the amended Young Plan were all submitted to the committee for review. Only the proposal to borrow 125 million marks of short-term foreign debt from foreign banking groups was passed by a majority of 325 votes to 237 votes.</p>
<p>Therefore, the difficult hurdle in the German political situation can be said to have passed temporarily. This is entirely due to the Social Democratic Party's unwillingness to bring down the cabinet at present. The number of votes obtained by the government side in this vote was made up of the Central Party, the People's Party, the Bavarian People's Party, the National Party, and the Economic Party, while the Social Party alone occupied more than 140 votes. As for the opposition parties, in addition to the Social National Party, the Communist Party, and the German National People's Party, which are irreconcilable with the government, only the Farmers' Party joined in. Therefore, the government actually managed to get a majority of 82 votes, which can be said to be fortunate.</p>
<p>The reason why the Social Democratic Party and the central right-leaning parties are making every effort to support the government this time is because the political and economic situation in Germany has become increasingly critical in recent months. If the current government falls, political power will inevitably fall into the hands of the extreme right. If this is the case, the future of the political situation will be unimaginable. Therefore, the various parties are all enduring for the time being so that the current government can safely get through the financial crisis. The Social Democratic Party has made a great sacrifice in this move. The financial bill issued by the Brüning cabinet this time completely represents the interests of the bourgeoisie and is especially harmful to the interests of the workers. It is no different from the Social Party betraying the working class it represents by supporting it, but in order to maintain the remnant of the republic and avoid the dictatorship of the right, it has to adopt this strategy.</p>
<p>But it would be a complete misrepresentation to say that the German political situation will turn from bad to good from now on. The voting in the National Assembly this time was only the first confrontation between the various parties. Although the government managed to win by luck, the current government's policies and the majority of political parties in the National Assembly are mutually exclusive. When the National Assembly reopens in early December, there will inevitably be a more intense debate. The financial and diplomatic cases that are temporarily shelved now will be contested by the various parties based on their own interests. As far as we can see, the Brüning cabinet will have no hope of escaping at that time. If so, the current political tide in Germany is only a ceasefire for more than forty days. What the end will be is still a big mystery.</p>
<p>The only thing that is certain is that although the current government has managed to survive, the general trend of the people's hearts and minds in this election and the direction of German foreign policy will inevitably change and will not be able to follow the established rules of the past few years. The postponement of payments under the Young Plan and the proposal to amend the Treaty of Versailles are almost the unanimous demands of all parties in the National Assembly. The government itself cannot ignore them. On the contrary, the Locarno Treaty and the Franco-German cooperation were the masterpieces of Stresemann and will no longer be heard by the Germans from now on. If this is the case, the tense atmosphere in Europe caused by the German election will not be eased by the temporary passage of the current German cabinet through the crisis.</p>
<p>In short, this winter will be a period to watch. Not only will the German political situation determine its direction of development when the National Assembly reopens in December, but the same is true of the major European countries. Austria is currently holding elections, and the Fascist Party is expected to have a great victory in the next National Assembly. The British Labor government still has a certain lifespan, which will be determined in the next parliament. As for France, the right wing is also gradually rising due to the results of the German election. In addition, the Radical Party is carrying out a vote of no confidence in the cabinet. It can be seen that the political situation in the major European countries will undergo significant changes in February and March. Its impact on the overall international situation will not be a minor event. The mountain rain is about to come, and the wind is filling the building. We will wait and see.

<p>Washington, August 8 (Reuters) The United States has fully recognized the new Brazilian government. This news was suddenly announced by Secretary of State Stimson. Before this, the Secretary of State and President Hoover had consulted for a long time and jointly considered detailed reports on the Brazilian political situation. The reason why the State Department took this resolute action was clearly to eliminate the diplomatic ill will caused by the United States' refusal to deal with the Brazilian revolutionary army's military supplies. The State Department also knows that if Britain recognizes the new government first, the United States' good market in Brazil will definitely be endangered. The United Kingdom is the most formidable enemy of the United States in this market.</p>

<p>Cao Fulin's Resolution of Gao Guizi's Troops (Jinan Correspondence) The news of the previous issue has been recorded. It is now heard that the resolution this time is the newly reorganized Shandong Garrison Second Brigade of Lu Xinwu, the remaining troops of Gao Guizi. The unit was originally stationed in the Rizhao Zhucheng area. A few days ago, Han Fuju ordered the unit to be transferred to Jinan for inspection and training. After the unit arrived in Gaomi, it stayed there and refused to move. Han then ordered Cao Fulin to lead Tang Yaoxun's 65th Brigade, the 14th Army Cavalry Artillery Pistol Team, and the Taishan and Shandong armored vehicles to the Jiaozhou Gaomi area to jointly deal with it with the 73rd Division of Zhan Shutang, and at the same time transferred Lu Xinwu to Jinan to discuss the suppression of bandits. Lu arrived in Jinan on the 4th, and Han immediately ordered him not to return to defense for the time being. On the same day, Zhan Shutang hosted a banquet in Gaomi City for the regiment commanders, battalion commanders, company commanders, and other officers of the unit. As soon as the officers arrived at the headquarters, they were detained. At this time, Lu's troops in the ancient city north of the city were surrounded and disarmed by Zhan Shutang, Tang Yaoxun's troops, the 14th Army Cavalry Artillery Pistol Team, and others, and completely resolved. There were more than 1,100 people in total, and more than 900 guns were seized. Zhan Shutang's division obtained 600 guns, and Tang Yaoxun's brigade obtained 300 guns. The regiment, battalion, company commanders, and other officers have been escorted to Jinan, and the soldiers have been retained for preferential use. The rest will be dismissed. (November 7</p>

<p>Lu Xingbang Appointed Commander of Bandit Suppression in Western Fujian</p>
<p>Four Provincial Committee Members Resumed Duties on the 3rd</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Chairman Yang, with the Fourth Plenary Session about to open, in addition to compiling and sending provincial proposals for deliberation, also departed for Beijing at 7:00 AM on the 5th, accompanied by Lin Sen, Zheng Baojing, Xu Xianshi, various provincial committee members, Chen Peikun, Lin Jinan, Jiang Pingfan, He Gonggan, Commander-in-Chief of the Land and Naval Forces Chen Jiliang, Division Commander of the 56th Division Liu Heding, and members of the Provincial Party Steering Committee, all of whom saw him off at the riverbank. The duties of the Chairman of the Provincial Government are temporarily managed by Chen Peikun, and the duties of the Director of the Civil Affairs Department are temporarily managed by Zheng Xiaocheng, the chief secretary of the department. Important matters are reported to Chen Peikun for handling, and military affairs are handled by Chen Jiliang. Lin Zhiyuan was originally scheduled to travel with Yang, but Yang ordered him to consult with Fang Shengtao and Sun Benrong to finalize some unfinished procedures, so he will depart tomorrow morning with Fang Shengtao for Shanghai, then to Beijing. Sun Benrong will remain in the province to negotiate the reorganization of Lu's forces.</p>
<p>Regarding military and political issues in the province, Chairman Yang convened Fang Shengtao and others at the headquarters a few days ago to conduct detailed discussions on matters such as pay, provisions, and defense areas. The entire province will be limited to ten regiments, divided into five brigades, with Qian Yuguang, Xiao Shuxuan, Chen Guohui, Zhang Ziming, and others serving as brigade commanders. The remaining brigade will be decided after Lu's forces have been fully incorporated. However, Lu Fang requested that the remnants of his forces be organized into two brigades and one independent regiment. After further discussion, it was decided that if Lu is willing to repent, he should be allowed to atone for his sins. Although organizing the remnants of his forces into two brigades and one independent regiment is somewhat excessive, if he can make efforts for the Party and the nation, his request may be granted. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Lu Xingbang is appointed as the Commander of the Bandit Suppression Front in Western Fujian. (2) All of Lu Fang's troops will withdraw from Youxi and Yanping, and concentrate in Qingliu and Ninghua. (3) After Lu's troops are concentrated in Qingliu and Ninghua, they will advance towards Western Fujian and eliminate the local bandits in Western Fujian within one month. (4) The defense areas of upstream Yanping and Youxi will be filled by troops dispatched by Liu's division, and Jian'ou and Shaowu will be filled by two brigades from the Land and Naval Forces. (5) The garrison locations of Lu's troops will initially be in Ninghua, Qingliu, and Guihua. Garrison locations will be allocated when the local bandits in Western Fujian are eliminated. (6) For the selection of brigade and regimental commanders for Lu's forces, Lu Xingming is proposed for the first brigade, Zhou Zhiqun is proposed for the second brigade, and Lu Xinming is proposed for the independent regiment. After the resolutions were passed, the entire case was handed over to Lu's representative, Lin Shaoqi, to telegraph Lu Xingbang for compliance. The formal appointment of Lu Xingbang as the Commander of Bandit Suppression in Western Fujian will be announced after being submitted to the central government for approval.</p>
<p>Another report says that when Lu Xingbang returned Zheng Baojing and the other five, he sent his nephew, Lin Shaoqi, who is currently the Chief of the Logistics Department of the Division, to the province with Sun Benrong to surrender to Yang Shuzhuang. After arriving in the province, Lin visited Yang several times and strongly argued that the recent unrest was entirely due to the instigation of Yang Yugu and his group, and requested that Lu be leniently treated. Yang discussed this with Liu Heding, Fang Shengtao, Chen Jiliang, and other generals who advocated suppressing Lu, and decided that since Lu had repented, he should show his sincerity. Lin Shaoqi then stated that Lu was willing to lead his troops to assist in suppressing the communist bandits in Western Fujian to atone for his sins. Yang then temporarily gave Lu the title of Commander of Bandit Suppression in Western Fujian, reorganized his troops into two brigades and one regiment, and transferred them to the Western Fujian Ting Prefecture to take on the task of suppressing the communists. However, because both Lu and Zhou were wanted by the National Government, Yang Shuzhuang requested Chairman Chiang to first revoke the arrest warrants when he went to Beijing, and then the provincial government would announce the appointments. Lu Xingming is currently being held in Zhejiang. It is hoped that he will be released after Yang contacts the National Government. Lin Shaoqi returned to Youxi to report after completing his mission one day after Yang Shuzhuang left the province. Currently, ships traveling between the upstream and the provincial capital have completely resumed, restoring the pre-war state. Furthermore, the telegraph poles between Fuzhou, northern Fujian, and Shanghai, which were cut down by Lu's troops after the outbreak of the war, are also being repaired by the Telecommunications Administration and will be restored soon. The military campaign against Lu in Fujian Province will thus come to an end.</p>
<p>The issue of the resumption of duties of the Provincial Government Committee members Zheng Baojing, Lin Zhiyuan, Xu Xianshi, and Cheng Shikui is still awaiting a reply from the National Government, but no reply has been received to date. Yang Shuzhuang was also eager to go to Beijing and could not wait any longer, so a compromise was reached on the 3rd, and the provincial government ordered the four to temporarily resume their duties. On the 4th, a provincial affairs meeting was convened, with all committee members in attendance, and Zheng Baojing was ordered to return to his position as Secretary-General. More than sixty important matters handled by the provincial government during the ten months since the provincial affairs meeting was suspended on January 6th were presented for separate ratification. The meeting began at 9:00 AM and ended at 4:00 PM. In addition, Zheng Baojing and the other three temporarily proposed a case for the commendation of Chen Naiyuan. Three resolutions were passed: (1) A monument will be built at a suitable location in the provincial capital. (2) The surviving family members will be given generous pensions in one lump sum. (3) Tuition fees will be subsidized for their children until they complete their education. Furthermore, regarding the property of Yang Yugu and Wu Xuan, the masterminds of the January 6th Incident, the Civil Affairs Department was ordered to seal it off together with the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Yang Shuzhuang, having completed the arrangements for the Fujian affair, departed for Beijing on the 5th. (November 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Shen Honglie Arrives in Qingdao from Weihai <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Northeast Naval Commander-in-Chief Shen Honglie, after arriving in Weihai from Changshan Island on the 22nd of last month, has been planning and arranging the defense of Weihai for days, and this has now been completed. At 7:30 AM on the 6th, he arrived in Qingdao on the Zhenhai warship and disembarked at the Qianhai pier. Those who welcomed him included Huang Xuyu, Director of the Naval Office in Qingdao, Hu Jiafeng, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, and various bureau chiefs. After Shen exchanged greetings with the welcoming personnel, he took a car to the naval headquarters to rest. It is reported that those who came with Shen also included Zhu Shiquan, Ge Zukong, Fang Zobao, and other three members of the Weihai reception committee. Zhu and others transferred to the Fengtian Maru and left for Shanghai at noon. I went to the naval headquarters at 4:00 PM to pay my respects to Shen. Because Shen was busy, he specially sent Director Huang Xuyu to meet with me. I asked about the security situation after Weihai was taken over. Huang replied that the order in Weihai was completely maintained by the marines and was currently safe and secure. In addition, the Jiangli warship will be stationed in Weihai to assist in defense. I asked about the damage to the Chuyu warship in the recent storm. He replied that the Chuyu warship encountered a storm at Chengshantou and suffered minor damage to its internal machinery. The ship is still anchored in its original location and has not moved. The Zhengji Company has chartered two ships to rescue it. It can be sailed after minor repairs. I asked if there were rumors that the marines stationed in Weihai had a slight misunderstanding with Liu Zhennian's army. He replied that the relationship between the navy stationed in Weihai and Liu's army was very good and the rumors of conflict were purely rumors. I asked about Shen's plan to establish a naval academy in Qingdao to train specialized personnel and its internal organization. He replied that the soldiers on each warship must be constantly trained, and the dining hall on the warship will be used as a lecture hall for training when on the water. Because most of the warships stationed in Qingdao are saving money, a school has been established in Laoshan, with the officers of each warship serving as instructors to facilitate the training of the soldiers on each warship, and no special school will be established. I asked about Shen's mission in Qingdao this time. He replied that Shen had been away from Qingdao for a long time and needed to plan and inspect the defense of Qingdao and the training of the First Fleet to achieve perfection. Furthermore, with the winter defense period approaching and the bandits in western Shandong not yet suppressed, we must also seek a way to pacify the people. Shen is currently meeting with the captains and commanders of the warships and has had considerable discussions on the above issues in order to implement them. At this point, I excused myself and left. (November 6th)</p>

<p>Qingdao Correspondence: During the international sports meeting held in Qingdao this month, Japanese middle school students, angry and ashamed of their failure in the basketball championship, insulted and beat students of Tiezhong and injured a police officer. After this case occurred, the Jiaoji Railway Administration Committee and the Qingdao Municipal Party Steering Committee sent letters to the Municipal Government one after another, requesting serious negotiations. The Public Security Bureau also submitted a list of the Japanese troublemakers and the injuries of the beaten police officers and students to the Municipal Government. After receiving the letters from all parties, the Municipal Government immediately sent personnel to make serious representations to the Japanese Consul in Qingdao. The Japanese Consul Kawagoe also stated that the fault for this conflict lay with the Japanese side and that the relationship between the two countries was very important. In order to seek understanding, he sent separate letters to the Municipal Government and the Jiaoji Railway Administration Committee a few days ago to express his apologies and declared that the troublemaking students had been severely warned and that such incidents would not occur again in the future. This case is likely to come to an end. (November 6th)</p>
<p>Recent Bandit Suppression Situation in Anhui Province</p>
<h3 id="e69">Each District is Responsible for Suppressing Bandits by Garrison Troops <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Since Wei Lihuang divided Anhui Province into districts to suppress bandits, the bandit atmosphere in each district has been slightly reduced compared to before due to the responsibility of the garrison troops. The Provincial Bandit Suppression Headquarters originally limited the period to October 10th, but because it had not been completely suppressed by the deadline, it continued to be suppressed. The recent bandit suppression situation in the seven districts is briefly described below: In the first district, the bandit gang of Jiang Guochang previously roamed the counties of Chuxian, Lai'an, Wuhe, and Sixian, and was very rampant. After the Bandit Suppression Commander of the district, Ge Wucheng, led the Third Cavalry Brigade under his command to track and pursue, it had already disintegrated. However, recently, there are still sporadic remnants of bandits looting near Gucheng and Dushan at the junction of Lai'an and Wuhe. Ge's brigade is currently searching for them. In the second district, the Henan bandit gang of Zhang Laoliu, which窜来阜阳境内 last month, has recently been repelled by the Bandit Suppression Commander of the district, Liu Zixin, in conjunction with the militia. There are still gangs of Henan bandits in the northwest of Suxian County, but it is difficult to annihilate them temporarily because they are entrenched in the mountains. In the third district, the bandits at the junction of Hefei, Dingyuan, and Shouxian have been greatly defeated by the Bandit Suppression Commander of the district, Song Shike, leading the Third Detachment under his command. However, bandits have recently sprung up again in the western countryside of Dingyuan. Song has sent troops to suppress them. The fourth district, which borders Henan, is the most rampant area for communist bandits. The Bandit Suppression Commander of the district, Pan Shanzhai, led the newly編 Fifth Brigade under his command to suppress them for half a year. Since the recapture of Yingshan, the communist bandits have fled back to Henan Province. Recently, Li Mingzhong, Commander of the Border Bandit Suppression of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, has specifically designated Jinjiazai in Liuan as the area for the bandit suppression of Ji Hongchang's army under his command. Li also telegraphed Wei Lihuang, requesting the dispatch of troops to assist in the suppression of the communist bandits when they窜境. However, after the Third Regiment of Pan's brigade was transferred from Huoshan to Qishui in eastern Hubei to block the communist bandits, it was heard that the entire unit would be transferred to Hubei Province under the control of He Chengjun. The Bandit Suppression Commander of the fifth district was originally兼任 by Tang Yunshan, Commander of the 15th Independent Brigade. After Tang's brigade was奉調 to Kaifeng last month, Wei Lihuang immediately appointed Yan Heling, Commander of the 57th Division, to take over. Yan took office in Anqing on the 5th. Today (the 6th), the Provincial Bandit Suppression Headquarters received a telegram from Yan Wei (the 5th), which briefly stated that because more than 2,000 bandits from Hubei had急窜宿松, he decided to lead two battalions and a machine gun company from Dongliu to宿防 suppress the bandits. The Bandit Suppression Commander of the sixth district was originally 兼任 by Lü Xueshu, Commander of the Capital Garrison Regiment. After Lü's regiment was调回 Nanjing, Wei Lihuang appointed Xu Guoting, Commander of the 57th Division, to take over. Xu took office in Wuhu on the first day of this month. The Provincial Bandit Suppression Headquarters has received電报 from Xu for days reporting that communist bandits have recently been discovered in Yaocun, the southern countryside of Langxi County, which borders Guangde. In addition to dispatching營長 Yan to lead two companies of soldiers from Guangde to suppress the bandits, two more battalions of troops carrying machine guns and mortars have been dispatched to suppress them in order to prevent them from spreading. The Bandit Suppression Commander of the seventh district was previously 兼任 by Liang Hanming, Commander of the First Regiment of the Anhui Provincial Security Office. Since Liang's regiment奉命 改編, the position of commander has not yet been委任. The district is currently the防地 of Yue Shengxuan's unit of the 57th Division. Yue had previously電卫 Lihuang that only three regiments of his unit had opened皖南 and that干部 personnel would be遴选 and派充 to the district after the majority had arrived. It is闻 that Zhang will still电 委任 by the术氏. (November 6th)</p>

Since田赋 has been划归省税, the previous items are no longer applicable. This year, Zhejiang Province公布征收地丁抵補金章程 has separately修正 the地丁銀, with each两以 one yuan and eight jiao as the正税 and the抵補金, with each石以 three yuan and three jiao as the正税. The 省税 items under the原有地丁项下 and the三角糧捐抵補金项下 must自十九年份新糧起 be取消一律 to comply with the legal system. In the future, each县报解地丁抵補金 of nineteen年份 shall按 one yuan and eight jiao and three yuan and three jiao列款分解统称 as the正税, and must not再列粮捐省税名目. 其各县在这个通令以前已解粮捐省税 of nineteen年份 will be查明 by the厅 and改收 as正税,用昭劃一. However, the 粮捐 under the 盐税项下 should still be专门报解 and is not included in this limit. 地丁抵補金 of the previous十八年份 should also follow旧贯按正省税粮捐 and is报解分款以清年限. In addition to sending this令separately,合行令仰该县长 and immediately遵照办理.</p>

<p>Total Losses in the Town Reach Tens of Millions</p>
<p>Jingzhen Correspondence: Jingdezhen in Jiangxi is a famous porcelain producing area and is known as one of the four major towns in China. Its commercial prosperity and important position surpass those of other counties in Jiangxi. On the morning of July 6th, communist bandits led by Fang Zhimin from Leping suddenly drove straight into the town with hundreds of bandits. The county police, due to lax defenses, had more than 300 guns confiscated. Fang immediately established a伪 Soviet government. Tens of thousands of workers in Jingzhen, all with shallow knowledge and easily susceptible to bandits'麻醉, immediately formed a general工会. The communist bandits also instigated the workers to arbitrarily抢夺勒令 stores to donate款没收庆泰典铺, and killed巿黨監委, causing panic among the people. Later, it was heard that省军 was about to莅镇, and Fang匪 withdrew on the night of the 9th, but the losses to local shops amounted to more than three million. On the 17th, the省府委派张团长 to the town, and the people's hearts were slightly settled. However, after a few days, the团奉令 returned to省. On September 8th,邵匪式平周匪建屏又乘虚窜至 from Hukou, numbering thousands of bandits, resulting in the second陷落 of Jingzhen. When the匪共入镇, they鸣枪示威. The people heard the sound and were失措, and the shops closed their doors one after another. After the匪入镇, they established a Soviet government at the县府委任磁工詹锦坤 as the General 工会常委. The general亡命工人流氓地痞莫不趨之若鶩, and羣起加入. In less than half a day, more than a hundred大大小小工会 were established, and a大举掠劫 was carried out. Those at the通关要隘 were daily派匪兵看守, traffic was断绝, and the people欲逃不得. The匪徒鸣锣令 ordered the shops to一律开市 within two hours, otherwise they would be没收. The商民 were抵抗无力 and祇得开门. Then the匪 immediately ordered the workers to實行暴动,携带刀枪武器 to each商铺 to search for资本, and then绑去千余人 to龙珠阁 to be用粗蔴绳綑绑 and then用尖刀刺颈. The杀人 as hemp,屍横遍野,诚属惨无人道. Later, it was heard that the谭道源部岳旅 was about to 来景镇. The匪遂于21日逸去, and when臨行时, the former商会会长陈仲西 and在会办事人员二十余人,另肉票数十人, were掳去 and索赎十万元. The statistic景镇loss was no less than five million. The乃岳旅驻镇仅一日 and奉令 returned to省, and the匪徒 then于10月2日捲士重来, numbering more than ten thousand. The people were惊弓之鸟, and闻风丧胆. When the匪 had not抵境, the 先行隻身逃亡者 was not计其数. The 匪共三次到镇 was赤焰较前尤炽. In addition to设立工会, they成立农民协会 and指令农民工人 to use千余辆车 to搬运货物 to各商店. All大大小小商店 and 人民住宅 were被抢夺殆尽,十室十空. Those在逃者 were mostly赤身裸足,栖身无所,家破人亡. Those who were未逃者 were勒入工会, and if there was违抗, they were immediately处死,致使良民亦被迫为匪. To date, the匪共 has盘踞 for more than twenty days and has not退. The瓷厂 has停顿, and the商业 has亦伤. In summary, the三次损失约达数千余万, and the fame of 中外素称瓷产之名区 is恐从兹不易复振,誠 is空前未有之浩劫. (October 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Villagers of Longjing Come to Shenyang to Petition <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Since the conflict between Chinese and Japanese military police in Longjing Village, Yanbian, the situation has become increasingly serious recently. At noon on the 3rd of this month, Fu Qiyang, the supervisor of the Daxing Electric Light Company in Longjing Village, came to Shenyang on behalf of the local people to request assistance from the National Diplomacy Association. According to Fu's account, the market has been extremely panicked since this case occurred. Initially, there were 400 Japanese police officers in various counties in Yanbian, setting up posts along the streets and alleys in Longjing Village. Recently, the number has increased to 800, and they are checking pedestrians at night, causing the merchants and residents to be shocked several times a night. The local officials fear that accidents will occur again, and the Japanese have repeatedly sought to cause provocation, so they ordered the military police not to enter the streets. Fortunately, no further accidents have occurred. This trip to Shenyang is purely to request the support of the people of Liaoning and the Diplomacy Association and to telegram the National Government to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese side so that the people of Yanbian can rest easy. It is闻 that after the Diplomacy Association received Fu's report, it telegraphed the Nanjing Foreign Ministry to seriously negotiate the Longjing Village incident so that the people of Yanbian could安枕.

<p>After the Four-Way Joint Transportation</p>
<h3 id="e73">Eastern Province Tries Out the Beilong Through Train <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Directly From Beiping to Heilongjiang</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Since the successful joint transportation of the Northeast Four Routes by the Beining Railway, it has been planned to operate the Northeast-West Four Routes in joint transportation. The vehicles used are still prepared by the Beining Railway, with six sets of undercarriages prepared for daily operation. A trial run has been carried out recently. Because the hooks of the passenger cars are different from the hook dimensions of the Taoang and other railways, it is inconvenient to replace them. The Beining Railway Bureau has ordered the Tangshan Machine Factory to speed up the transformation, and it will be put into operation after the transformation. It is expected to be realized in November. The train is called the Beilong Through Train, and the route passes through the Beining, Sitao, Taoang, and Qike Railways. The travel time is about 41 hours. Major stations include Tongliao, Zhengjiatun, Taonan, Angangxi, etc., directly reaching Qiqihar, the capital of Heilongjiang Province, which is extremely convenient for passengers. The Northeast authorities have long had a plan to form a railway network with the Beining as the center. Now that the Pingji and Beilong through trains have been opened one after another, this plan can be initially completed. It is闻 that the timetable for the Beilong through train has been agreed upon by the Beining and other four railway bureaus. However, the method of the through train is different from that of the Pingji through train. The through train vehicles are attached to the original passenger cars of each road and then operate, so the vehicle numbers used on each road are not uniform. The attached train schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Beiping to Longjiang (Beining Railway) Train No. 105 departs from Beiping at 11:10 AM and arrives at Dahushan at 6:06 AM. Train No. 703 departs from Dahushan at 7:40 AM and arrives at Tongliao at 6:10 PM. (Sitao Railway) Train No. 8 departs from Tongliao at 7:50 PM and arrives at Zhengjiatun at 11:40 PM. Train No. 3 departs from Zhengjiatun at 0:25 AM and arrives at Taonan at 7:30 AM. (Taoang Qike Railway) Train No. 1 departs from Taonan at 8:40 AM and arrives at Longjiang at 4:55 PM.</p>
<p>(2) Longjiang to Beiping (Taoang Qike Railway) Train No. 2 departs from Longjiang at 8:10 AM and arrives at Taonan at 4:20 PM. (Sitao Railway) Train No. 4 departs from Taonan at 5:45 PM and arrives at Zhengjiatun at 1:40 AM. Train No. 7 departs from Zhengjiatun at 2:10 AM and arrives at Tongliao at 6:00 AM. (Beining Railway) Train No. 704 departs from Tongliao at 7:10 AM and arrives at Dahushan at 5:58 PM. Train No. 106 departs from Dahushan at 6:30 PM and arrives at Beiping at 2:15 PM.

<p>Kidnapping Case in Lianrong Town: Ransom Victims Escape Danger. It is already reported in this newspaper that on the evening of the 6th, the home of Hua Jinhan, a wealthy household in the Dongjie of Beiqi Fang, Lianrong Town (Qingcheng City), 15th District, was robbed and Hua's concubine, Ms. Wu, and his eldest daughter, Xiangying, were kidnapped, with a ransom of 20,000 yuan demanded. It is now learned that on the night of the incident, the robbers kidnapped Hua's concubine, Ms. Wu, and Hua Xiangying. They covered the eyes of each of them with black cloth, carried them to Zhangcunbang, and forced them into a bandit boat. The boat sailed to the vicinity of Huangqiao, Jiangyin County, more than ten miles away from Beiqi Fang, and stopped. The bandits removed the black cloth covering their eyes and ordered them to disembark to a dilapidated house. The house consisted of three rooms with a single entrance. Inside, there were straw mats and a few worn-out items. The bandits cooked dinner and offered it to the two ransom victims. After dinner, it was already late at night, and they waited until dawn. The next day (the 7th), one of the bandits, who resembled a ringleader (some say it was an old woman), suddenly said to Ms. Wu and her daughter, "Today, we have decided to send you two home. However, the Tiandan stolen from your home (calculated to be 320 mu, which Hua Jinhan gave to his concubine and daughter in half) must remain here. Your family must prepare the ransom to redeem it. After you return home, do not publicize it. If you report it to the authorities for investigation or fail to redeem the Tiandan, we will send people to set fire to your houses within a short period of time." They then sent bandits to escort Ms. Hua and her daughter to the riverbank, where they boarded a boat and sent them back. At about 8 o'clock that evening, the boat arrived at Xiehe, a place bordering Wuxi (about three miles from Beiqi Fang). They ordered the two to disembark and return home. Ms. Hua and her daughter, because it was already dark, did not recognize the way and wandered for a long time. Later, a fishing boat passed by, and they immediately hired the boat to return home quickly. After arriving home, Hua Jinhan and his son and relatives were overjoyed. Ms. Wu of the Hua family said that one of the robbers in the case had a pockmarked face and looked familiar.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>It resembled a certain Jia who frequently entered and exited the Xun family. Moreover, the accents of the robbers were all from Jiangyin, so there were clues to be found.</p>
<p>Murder Case: Clues Obtained. It is learned that Zeng Haishan, a local merchant residing at No. 12 Junzi Workshop, Beiqi Kou, in the county, and his concubine, Yao Laoer, were living upstairs when they were suddenly attacked by thugs with knives the night before last, suffering more than twenty wounds to the head, face, hands, ears, and other parts. Afterward, they were admitted to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. It is now learned that Zeng Haishan's condition gradually improved yesterday, but he still could not eat. His first wife, Ms. Zhang, received the news from Suzhou and returned to Wuxi to visit the hospital. She also learned that Yao Laoer was suspected of knowing about the attempted murder of Zeng. Ms. Zhang reported this to the Sixth Sub-Bureau of Public Security in charge and requested that Yao Laoer be arrested. Sub-Bureau Chief Duan, after receiving the report, immediately dispatched police to arrest Yao Laoer and brought her to the bureau for interrogation. She was then transferred to the County Government for questioning.</p>
<p>Shen Yaozu Induces and Abducts Four Female Workers. Shen Yaozu, a young owner of a tofu shop outside the South Gate of the county, is currently working as a clerk in the Yongyu Silk Factory in Yangyao. He is naturally cunning and fond of seeking pleasure. Usually, he specializes in seeking out women, and it is unknown how many respectable girls have been defiled by him. On the afternoon of the 31st of last month, he induced four female workers from the factory, Yu Axin (18 years old), Zhu Aer (19 years old), Feng Hongying (20 years old), and Lu Hexiu (18 years old), to take a car to Shanghai and spend a sweet time together in a rented room. However, the good dream did not last long. Feng Hongying's husband, Feng Wenwei, found out and was very angry. He immediately negotiated with Shen. Shen, realizing that things were not good, returned to Wuxi with Feng Hongying and Lu Hexiu the day before yesterday and stayed at the Railway Hotel. Feng Wenwei also tracked them to Wuxi and reported to the Sixth Sub-Bureau of Public Security. Sub-Bureau Chief Duan, after receiving the report, dispatched police to the Railway Hotel and arrested Shen Yaozu, Feng Hongying, and Lu Hexiu. At the same time, the families of Yu and Zhu heard that their daughters had been induced and abducted to Shanghai by Shen Yaozu and had not returned, fearing that they had been trafficked. Yesterday, they also reported to the Sixth Sub-Bureau and requested an investigation. Sub-Bureau Chief Duan, considering that the case involved inducement, abduction, and trafficking, immediately prepared a document and submitted it to the Main Bureau for transfer to the County Government for handling.</p>

<p>Kidnapping Case in Nansong Village. The night before last, six bandits in plain clothes, each carrying firearms, suddenly came to Nansong Village in the county. They first went to the home of farmer Ge Cailin and tied up Ge and his wife. They used fire to burn them and tortured them to reveal the location of their hidden silver. Ge cried out in pain and revealed everything. It is reported that clothes and silver dollars were stolen, causing great losses. Afterward, they went to the homes of Tang Yonggao and Song Shangpin, where they searched extensively. Before leaving, they left two threatening letters, one demanding 15,000 yuan from the village and the other demanding 20,000 yuan from the nearby Lin Family Village.

<p>All Sectors Express Opinions on the Handling of Banditry Cases by the Court. On the 8th, the district chiefs of all eighteen districts in Nantong County and representatives of various groups and organizations jointly telegraphed the Provincial Government, stating that Nantong County had repeatedly suffered from the disasters of communist bandits killing, plundering, and burning. Fortunately, the provincial and county police and the security regiment cooperated in suppressing and suppressing them, which brought a little peace. However, the communist bandits captured alive and sent to the court were often given lenient sentences based on one-sided statements. Communist bandits who were killed on the spot or attempted to escape were often buried, and the court often granted the requests of their families without first investigating. On the contrary, the teams and regiments that suppressed the bandits were often blamed for this. The bandits became more rampant, and the people became more fearful.</p>
<p>They earnestly requested that the High Court be consulted to strictly order the County Court to pay strict attention to uphold justice and maintain local stability.</p>
<p>Crackdown on Counterfeit Money Selling Organization. A large amount of counterfeit money was discovered in Jinsha District. The main culprit, Zhang Shunyuan, has been arrested. The counterfeit currency amounted to 200,000 yuan. Jinsha is the general distribution center for Jiangbei. The witnesses and evidence have been sent to the County Court for questioning.</p>
<p>Arrest of Murderer at the Morgue. Zhang Jinsheng and Wang Jinsheng, both 17 years old, workers in the fine yarn room of Dasheng Deputy Factory in Chengnan, were laughing with each other when Wang Jinsheng laughed loudly, resulting in Zhang Jinsheng injuring Wang Jinsheng in the waist with a wooden leg, causing him to die. The County Court Prosecutor Zhu went to examine the body and, because the injury was not critical, did not fill out an injury report, causing a great uproar among the local people, women, and children. As a result, a re-examination was conducted and a report was filled out. The prosecutor's office has arrested the murderer, Wang Jinsheng, and the coffin has not yet been nailed shut, as there are still questions.</p>

<p>Banditry Cases Occur Frequently in the Western Countryside. The rampant banditry in the Changxing County border of Huzhou is unparalleled. Recently, there have been frequent kidnappings and robberies near the outer city. Ai Qilong, a tenant farmer from outside the Changxing West Gate, relies on farming for a living. Unexpectedly, at about 6:00 PM on the 6th, seven or eight bandits speaking with a Henan accent suddenly broke into his house, ransacked everything, and kidnapped Ai Qilong's daughter, leaving a letter demanding a large sum of money. Furthermore, the family of Chen Xixing, a resident of Qiliting outside the West Gate, was well-to-do. Seeing the rampant banditry in recent years, they moved to the city last year, leaving only workers in the countryside. Unexpectedly, at about 7:00 PM on the 5th of this month, seven bandits with Henan accents, each carrying a wooden-cased gun, rushed to their house, placed a letter of extortion on the table in the middle hall, and fired several shots into the air. The workers in the house had already fled. The bandits entered the house and, finding nothing to take, set fire to Chen's straw pile in the rice field. It is now reported that the extortion letter demanded 26,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Population Survey of Hangzhou City. In recent years, the population of Hangzhou City has been increasing day by day, and prices have also been rising accordingly. However, the most obvious is the price of housing, which has increased more than five times since the founding of the Republic of China. It is unknown how the life of Hangzhou City will change in ten years. The accurate figures recently obtained by the Public Security Bureau are recorded below. The city has a total of 97,316 households, with 301,678 males and 194,938 females, for a total of 496,616 people. This is an increase of more than 2,000 people compared to the previous survey. The number of births is 488, and the mortality rate is 685.</p>
<p>Handling Food Inspection and Registration. The Municipal Government received an order from the Provincial Government yesterday to issue regulations for the inspection and registration of rice entering, exiting, and transiting. According to Article 1, Hangzhou City also has a customs port and should establish an agency to handle the matter so that the central government can statistically analyze surpluses and deficits and allocate resources appropriately. Mayor Cai believes that the matter concerns the ministry's order and that establishing a separate agency for civilian food will incur unnecessary expenses and cause difficulties in implementation. He specifically ordered the departments to comply and establish the agency as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Wei Beitao Suffers from Nerve Disorder in Prison. Wei Beitao, the former chief of the First Section of the Finance Department, was dismissed by the Provincial Government and handed over to the Hangzhou County Local Court for trial on charges of accepting bribes in the Jiasu Shaxian donation case. He was sentenced to five years in prison but appealed. He was detained in the detention center. Recently, Wei suddenly suffered from a nerve disorder, similar to Zhu Zhijue's words. The case was originally scheduled to be continued yesterday (the 9th) by the First Criminal Court. After receiving the report, a forensic doctor was ordered to diagnose and treat him, and it seems difficult to question him for the time being.</p>

<p>Ningbo City Continues to Exist. The village and neighborhood committees and citizens of Ningbo City believe that since the establishment of Ningbo City more than three years ago, it has wasted more than 2 million yuan of public funds and has achieved nothing. The gains do not outweigh the losses. Moreover, the population of Ningbo City is less than 200,000, which is not in line with the regulations for organizing a city government. They have repeatedly petitioned the Provincial Government and forwarded it to the Central Government, requesting the abolition of Ningbo City in order to reduce the burden on the citizens. In the past three or four months, they have loudly called for this movement. After Chairman Chiang returned to Fenghua, the various committees and citizens also elected representatives twice to go to Fenghua and submit petitions to Chairman Chiang. It is now learned that the National Government decided yesterday that Ningbo City should continue to be established due to its special historical relationship. The outcry to abolish the city will gradually subside.</p>
<p>Pirates Invade Ligang for the Second Time. More than ninety pirates, on the 30th of last month, seeing that there was no news of a ransom for the kidnapped victims and that the Haijing warship sent to the area by the Water Police Bureau had left, banded together again with seventy or eighty people and went to Ligang on the afternoon of the 4th to intimidate and demonstrate. The residents fled again upon hearing the news, and no one dared to stay overnight. Mr. Wang and other gentry in the village, believing that the livelihood of the people would be unbearable in the long run, jointly went to the city yesterday to request troops to be stationed there.</p>

<h3 id="e87">The Ministry of Education Does Not Allow Winter Vacation Again <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that the Ministry of Education recently issued an order to all levels of schools across the country prohibiting them from having winter vacations again. The original order is recorded below:</p>
<p>It has been found that the winter vacation for schools is actually a disguised form of the lunar New Year holiday. The Ministry has previously followed the National Government's repeated promotion of the national calendar and the prohibition of the lunar calendar, and has decided to abolish it. Since the 19th year, all levels of schools across the country must not have winter vacations again. The date of the national New Year holiday has been extended to three weeks. The regulations on the school year, semester, and holiday dates have been revised and submitted to the National Government for approval and filing, and an order was issued on March 22 of this year to all for compliance. Now that the date of the national New Year holiday is approaching, the Ministry is deeply concerned that at the beginning of the reform, schools may be insincere in their compliance. It is reiterated that since the 19th year, all levels of schools across the country, except for Guangdong Province, which is allowed to reduce the New Year holiday by one week and move it to the summer vacation due to its proximity to the tropics, should strictly comply with the revised regulations on the school year, semester, and holiday dates and have a three-week national New Year holiday. They must not have winter vacations outside of the national New Year holiday, and they must not reduce the number of New Year holiday days without authorization or exceed the restrictions on the number of days for the start of the semester and arbitrarily increase the number of days for disguised winter vacations in order to comply with the purpose of promoting the national calendar. You are hereby instructed to comply and instruct your subordinates to comply with this order.</p>
<p>Suzhou Agricultural School Announces the Course of the Disturbance</p>
<h3 id="e88">Pan Tianjue, Director of Training, Is Indeed Suspected of Instigating It <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Suzhou Agricultural School, regarding the disturbance among pre-college students, issued a statement to all sectors: The school was unfortunately involved in a disturbance by a small number of pre-college students on October 31, who used the reason that the porridge contained bean husks to beat teachers and hold them hostage for a strike. The beginning and end of the situation are hereby presented to all sectors. After the school was reorganized in the 16th year of the Republic of China and the academic atmosphere was rampant, it followed the party's program and made a decision to implement strict training. Therefore, in order to implement strict training, the pre-college students should be taught in separate schools so that they can be given appropriate training separately. Therefore, in the summer of the 17th year of the Republic of China, the pre-college students were separately set up in Liuyuan Road to strictly train the party.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Illegal Meeting of the Student Union <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The dispute over the principal issue has now been resolved. The University Student Union, citing Liu Shichao and others' violation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's "Preliminary of People's Rights" by arbitrarily implementing illegal proposals after a quorum shortage at the general assembly, had petitioned the Beijing Municipal Party Headquarters to prevent it. Now, Beijing Municipal Party Headquarters' Twelfth Approval states: "Received the petition, and after investigation, this headquarters also received a petition from the Eighth District Executive Committee. This headquarters' 66th meeting resolved that the student union's assembly had not been reported to this headquarters in accordance with the law, and the establishment of a special committee is particularly inappropriate. In addition to ordering the Eighth District Reporting Committee, you are hereby notified."</p>
<p>Mr. Dai Qixiang is requested to be the director, taking full responsibility for all pre-college professors. For three years, the academic atmosphere has been orderly, and students have greatly admired and harmoniously coexisted with Mr. Dai without any conflicts. This demonstrates that Mr. Dai's management of the pre-college program is appropriately strict and lenient. This semester, because Mr. Dai's teaching hours are relatively numerous and his duties in the academic affairs are heavy, the newly appointed Dean of Students and Party Ideology teacher, Pan Tianjue, will be stationed at the Second Academy as a fundamental training measure, taking full responsibility for discipline and dormitory affairs. For the convenience of operation, Li Fengming was introduced by Mr. Pan as the dormitory staff member of the Second Academy. Only two months after taking office, Mr. Pan was deemed too irresponsible in terms of management and discipline, and students were entering and leaving freely, violating the school's regulations. Therefore, the school principal instructed Mr. Pan to transfer to the First Academy on November 1st. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 31st, students used the pretext that there were bean shells mixed in the porridge, smashed dozens of bowls, and without asking about the situation, swarmed into Director Dai's bedroom, severely beating him and driving him out of the school, locking the main gate. Other teachers, hearing the alarm, gathered and saw that Mr. Dai was not fully dressed and had suffered many injuries. They immediately called for medical treatment and gathered for a lecture, earnestly admonishing and instructing them to attend classes as usual. Most students expressed acceptance, but a few students obstructed them, creating a wait-and-see situation. In less than half an hour, declarations and slogans had spread throughout the school. The order of the dining hall and the quality of the food are the responsibility of the Dean of Students and the dormitory staff. It is suspicious that students did not inquire of Mr. Pan and Mr. Li, but instead made a scene with Mr. Dai. Moreover, when students swarmed to Mr. Dai's residence, it was 6:15 in the morning, only fifteen minutes after the wake-up bell, and before breakfast time, students took action. Therefore, most students did not eat breakfast that day. After the upheaval broke out, teachers and staff gathered to discuss how to deal with the aftermath, but Mr. Pan and Mr. Li were still in bed. Students filled the school with declarations and slogans within half an hour of the upheaval, indicating that they had prepared in advance. Mr. Pan and Mr. Li were in charge of discipline and dormitory affairs, so why did they have no precautions and why did they behave ambiguously after the fact, as if they were indifferent? Moreover, they told the school principal that students had not overstepped their bounds and had no background. From the perspective of the party, they did not feel that there was any violation. The best solution now is to fully accommodate the students' demands. Subsequently, the principal lectured repeatedly, and the teachers and staff repeatedly persuaded, but Mr. Pan and others never said a word. This is the real situation before and after the upheaval. After the upheaval broke out, the school principal, seeing that the relationship between Director Dai and the students had broken down, approved Director Dai's resignation. Then, the students' goal had been achieved, and it seemed that they should resume classes immediately. However, the students became even more arrogant, rushing to the undergraduate department to disrupt order on the 1st, and obstructing the undergraduate memorial week and beating the undergraduate dormitory staff member Zhu Zhihua on the 3rd. Their actions became increasingly absurd. On the 4th, they received a telegram from the Ministry of Education ordering a thorough investigation and proper handling to maintain academic discipline. Therefore, the principal convened a school affairs meeting to discuss solutions. After a four-hour meeting, it was unanimously agreed that the students who led the beating of teachers, held hostage, and boycotted classes were defying the law and beyond the reach of school education. Only by selecting and punishing them could academic discipline be maintained. Therefore, on the morning of the 5th, the leading troublemakers, Sun Cuifu, Zang Zhongchun, Jing Zhichang, Xiang Xuehai, Zhang Da, Zhou Jun, Shen Ruilin, Wu Xixiang, Zhao Chuanxu, Sheng Hua, He Senni, Zhang Shu, Zhou Zhiang, Zeng Yuanpei, Wang Hanxiong, and other fifteen students were expelled and escorted out of the campus. Those whose circumstances were lighter were given demerits, including Wu Tingchen, Pan Xikang, Li Hongxun, Hua Younian, Song Fengzhai, Chu Fusheng, Zhu Jingyuan, Xu Zhengshi, Jin Fa, Ye Haoquan, Zhang Hancai, Shao Jinpeng, Jiang Yintang, Wang Qinghao, Fu Zhengfu, Zhang Guoji, Zhao Peishou, Fang Zhenzhong, Xie Jingyuan, Yang Bosong, and other twenty people. At that time, Mr. Pan, who instigated the upheaval, had abandoned his post and left the school on the afternoon of the 3rd. Therefore, the students no longer insisted and signed their names, willing to resume classes immediately. Therefore, the order was restored from 10:00 a.m., and students who left the school have been notified to return to school by newspaper and letter. This is the real situation of handling the upheaval.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the current upheaval has been quelled with the assistance of party headquarters at all levels and local agencies, as well as the upholding of public opinion by the media. On the 5th, a lecture was convened, and classes were resumed as usual. On the morning of the 6th, Secretary Huang Shaohong, a representative of the Ministry of Education, came to the school to earnestly lecture the students. The students expressed their remorse on the spot, saying that they would never overstep their bounds again. Therefore, the upheaval was completely resolved. However, after the pain subsides, thinking about the endless disturbances and the days of students' time and studies being unnecessarily sacrificed, the minority's conspiracy to trap the whole situation in destruction fills the heart with unspeakable guilt. Respectfully summarizing the main points and sincerely reporting them, I humbly request your judgment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that Secretary Huang Shaohong was previously sent by the provincial government to Suzhou to investigate and believed that the school's handling of the upheaval was extremely appropriate. The previous evening, the Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee sent Comrade Song Yufeng to Suzhou to investigate. Yesterday afternoon, accompanied by Mr. Yan and Mr. Jiang from the County Party Headquarters, they went to the school for a detailed six-hour investigation, believing that Pan Tianjue was indeed suspected of instigating the upheaval and will report the findings to the province for review.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 9th - The Capital Women's Law College had previously submitted a request to the Municipal Education Bureau to forward to the Ministry of Education for record-keeping. It has now received an order from the Ministry approving its establishment. The college held an inauguration meeting at the Women's Political and Legal Training Institute on the 9th.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Refusal of Song Binggong by Education Sector in Fengxian, Via Telegram <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Since the provincial government's 345th meeting appointed Song Binggong as the director of the Fengxian County Education Bureau, the entire county's education sector has been outraged and unanimously opposed. The telegram to the provincial government is recorded below:</p>
<p>Submitted for Review: It was recently reported with shock and dismay that the provincial government meeting has approved the appointment of Song Binggong to replace Zhan Song as the director of the County Education Bureau. The entire sector is bewildered. Article 17 of the revised County Organization Law promulgated by the National Government in July of this year stipulates that each bureau of the county government shall have one director, to be selected by the county magistrate from among qualified candidates who have passed the examination and submitted to the provincial government for approval. If there is a real need to change the director of the County Education Bureau, it should be handled in accordance with the law. However, the provincial government directly appointed him without going through the county magistrate's selection process, which means that the promulgated County Organization Law is not being treated as a mere formality. Moreover, it is heard that Song Binggong is affiliated with Nantong and is completely unfamiliar with the situation in the county. It is inappropriate for him to come to lead education as the people and place are not suitable. The county does not lack qualified personnel, so why borrow talent from other places? The sector believes that the issue of the director's selection is of great importance to the future of education and in order to respect the law, it is impossible to recognize the education director who has not been produced in accordance with the County Organization Law. We especially request the Honorable Department to investigate and promptly forward this to the provincial government to withdraw the appointment and order the Fengxian County government to select and submit a candidate for approval in accordance with the law, so as to comply with the law and emphasize education. We are awaiting orders with extreme urgency. Respectfully submitted to Chen, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Yu Youren Takes Office as Principal of China Public School Today <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Two Announcements Issued Yesterday</p>
<p>(National Society) Yu Youren, the newly appointed principal of Wusong China Public School, is scheduled to arrive at the school today (the 10th) to take office. Various details have been noted in previous reports. It is now known that yesterday afternoon (the 9th) at 2:00 PM, Principal Yu sent two personally written announcements to the school to be posted. The original text of the two announcements are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) To the students of China Public School: Yu Youren has been recuperating at sea. Previously, when the board of directors of China Public School recommended me as principal, I strongly declined to Chairman Cai because my mental and physical strength and time were insufficient to handle the job and would be regrettable to hinder it. However, with the thought that if the school affairs were not decided for even a day, the students' studies would be a pity, I requested the board of directors to recommend other capable people to preside over the school. Before a replacement is recommended, Yu Youren will temporarily maintain it. This is my sincere intention. I hope that all will understand. Yu Youren, November 9th.</p>
<p>(2) I will arrive at the school tomorrow at 2:00 PM to announce my intention to maintain the school. Addressed to the students of China Public School. Yu Youren, November 9th.</p>
<p>Welcome from the Eighth District Party Headquarters: The Eighth District Party Headquarters sent a telegram to Central Committee member Yu Youren to welcome him as the new principal of China Public School. Translated by Shanghai newspapers to Mr. Yu Youren: Having read the report that the China Public School Council has resolved to approve Mr. Ma Junwu's resignation and re-elected you as principal, and scheduled to arrive at the school on the 10th to assume office, we are extremely delighted upon hearing this news. We secretly investigated that the student body of China Public School is known to be complex. Former Principal Ma Junwu had ulterior motives and deliberately sheltered the reactionary elements, and the reactionary elements are becoming more and more arrogant. Members of our district party headquarters who study at the school often suffer unreasonable oppression in case of disputes, which is painful to say. Mr. Yu, a pillar of the party and the country and a celebrity in the academic circle, must have many good strategies to eliminate the scum. We can foresee that China Public School will make great progress, and the students are eagerly awaiting it. Our district department is especially hoping for it. We respectfully send this telegram to welcome you with earnest anticipation. Shanghai Special City Eighth District Party Headquarters Executive Committee.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Opposition to Dean Li Lianggong <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Request for Removal by the School Affairs Meeting</p>
<p>More than two months have passed since the former president of Labor University was relieved of his concurrent post. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government had discussed three measures with the school's founders Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, and Cai Yuanpei. These measures have been disclosed in this newspaper several times. The faculty, staff, and students of the school have expressed great satisfaction with the three measures ordered by Chairman Chiang and eagerly hope that the president will be announced as soon as possible so that someone can preside over the school affairs and the students can study with peace of mind. According to news from the school's secretariat, Li Lianggong, the dean of the Agricultural College, is conspiring for power and coveting the position of president. He is instigating unrest and attacking colleagues with his extreme ability to provoke and alienate. This conspiracy has now been discovered by the college's professors and students. All department heads and professors have implemented a strike to oppose Li Lianggong's actions and have also published a statement to the students, detailing Li Lianggong's conspiracy to covet the position of president and the baseness of his character.</p>

<p>Zhenru Lost to Shanghai</p>
<p>Two to Three :: First Half One to One</p>
<p>The Westerners' Club Group A Championship match between the Zhenru Football Team and the Shanghai Westerners' Team was held at Shen Garden yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. After ninety minutes of fierce fighting, Zhenru lost 2-3. The referee was Maxwell, and the linesmen were Liang Guocai for Zhenru and Irwin for Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Inconvenience of Marching in the Mud <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Due to continuous heavy rain, the roads are muddy and all the football fields have become swamps. The athletes' football shoes are hung high, suffering from being unable to display their skills. Fortunately, the weather cleared up yesterday, and the game was held. However, the green field was saturated with water, and it was difficult to run, with falls and tumbles occurring at any time. The ball became heavier and harder to use. The Westerners had strong physical strength and occupied a lot of ground. However, after being exhausted in battle, they were not as agile as the Chinese.</p>
<h3 id="e98">No Hope of Victory Without the Center Forward <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Zhenru's strength is not below that of Shanghai. Initially, they were troubled by not being good at fighting in wet conditions, but after a long time, they gained the essence of it and saw themselves on par, with a fierce aggression that was astonishing. But heaven did not bless Zhenru, causing their main forward general Dai Linjing to be injured and unable to play. Otherwise, the outcome of the victory or defeat would not be predictable. Chen Zhenhe is the bravest of the three armies, a versatile talent on the football field. He can still be considered competent in defense, but the forward connection is not pure, and the inside and outside cannot communicate in one breath, which is his major problem. The most outstanding talent in the Shanghai team is the left inside forward Cole. The performance of the left winger Henry is also good. Inside players Stoke and Monroe can also be active and productive. The victory came mostly from hand-to-hand combat, as they can make good use of their innate physical strength.</p>
<h3 id="e99">(3) The Lineup of the Two Teams <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Team: Gray Rook, Stoke, Fabin, Sumner, Monroe, Sheffer, Henry, Cole, Sinclair, Bowden, Bright</p>
<p>Zhenru Team: Liang Guanlian, Feng Yunyou, Jiang Shanjing, Lin Songfa, Chen Zhenhe, Zhuang Shihong, Chen Bingxiang, Fu Hexuan, Dai Linjing, Chen Jiaqiu, Mei Hongbao</p>
<h3 id="e100">(4) A Misstep Almost Became an Eternal Regret <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The bell rang three times, and the battle began. Shanghai rushed in like a tide, and a dangerous situation immediately appeared. The left winger Henry passed the ball accurately, and center forward Sinclair advanced quickly, but the goalkeeper rushed out to save and they stumbled and fell to the ground, narrowly missing the goal. The momentum reversed, and Dai charged straight in. Suddenly, he passed to the right to Mei, who quickly picked up the ball, and the enemy formation became chaotic. Fu leaped forward to meet the ball, but was unable to stop in time, and his full of hope turned into smoke. Shanghai's right wing rose up again, and the hand-to-hand combat gradually approached the hinterland. Goalkeeper Liang looked flustered and did not know what to do. A ball from the right went through the empty goal, and the right winger Henry kicked it with a thunderous applause, seeming to predict its success, but the ball did not follow his heart and flew high.</p>
<h3 id="e101">(5) Each Side Scored a Goal in Ten Minutes <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai continued to attack with strong momentum. Bowden made a horizontal attack, and the ball happened to be intercepted by Chen Zhenhe, who was offside, and it rolled into the goal. It was truly a case of "shooting oneself in the foot." After conceding a goal, Zhenru tried to recover, and the five forwards used low and near passes, advancing step by step. When they reached the city, the left and right encirclement had formed. Although the enemy was stubborn, they felt it difficult to take care of both sides. In the moment of decision, the goalkeeper saved the ball and fell to the ground, and Fu Hexuan touched the ground and rolled into the net. Both sides scored a goal, with the time before and after being within ten minutes. After this fifteen minutes, the strength was equal and it was difficult to distinguish the victory or defeat. The first half ended with a score of one to one.</p>
<h3 id="e102">(6) Lost the Goal Again and the General Was Injured <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The whistle blew, and the Shanghai team advanced in five ways with unstoppable momentum. Zhenru's front and rear defense lines were lost. The enemy filled the front of the goal and fought to the death without retreating. Finally, Henry received Bowden's ball and shot it into the goal while falling to the ground. At that time, Dai was leading the forwards to counterattack and the situation was serious, but he suffered an injury to his leg and it was difficult to move, so he had to leave the field for rest. Since then, Zhenru lacked a general, and the strength of the eleven against ten was not as good as before. Chen Zhenhe held the important position of the center back and always took the lead in battle. Once, he took advantage of the enemy's emptiness to directly attack the goal, but after a moment of hesitation, he was pushed out by the goalkeeper.</p>
<h3 id="e103">(7) Outnumbered and Outflanked <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Five minutes later, Chen Zhenhe executed a free kick 30 yards from the goal, and the ball went straight into the enemy's goal and over the goal, missing by only an inch. Shanghai Stoke kicked a free kick in the center of the field and landed in front of the goal. Cole crossed arms with Zhu of Chen Bingxiang and made a surprising move, carrying the ball out of his own formation and rushing all the way without any obstacles. Unexpectedly, the two inside defenders of Shanghai chased from behind to stop him and prevent him from kicking, and the whole effort was in vain. In the blink of an eye, Shanghai launched another attack on the goal, and Bowden passed a ball horizontally. Cole calmly shot and Shanghai took a 3-1 lead.</p>
<h3 id="e104">(8) Showing Skills and Winning Back a Goal <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>In this critical situation, Zhenru used all its strength, and although they were at a disadvantage, their offense was stronger than the enemy's. Chen Zhenhe tried his best in the front and was quite active. At 4:25, Mei Hongbao passed from the right to the middle, Chen Zhenhe chased and collided with the goalkeeper and fell to the ground. The ball rebounded and Mei kicked it into the empty goal, making it 2-3. Zhenru was still behind by one goal. At this time, Shanghai's situation was reversed and became dangerous. The injured goalkeeper could not perform his duties and was replaced by Sinclair. Zhenru completely went from being attacked to being in the position of attacking. Shanghai could only retreat completely to maintain the winning situation. When the goalkeeper came out again, it was difficult for Shanghai to restore its military appearance. As a result, Shanghai still won 3-2, which can be said to be fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Western Football Club Group A Results <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The interest in the Western Football Club this year does not seem to be as good as in previous years. One is that the strength of Lehua has been greatly hit, and Chinese spectators feel quite disappointed. However, the rising star Zhenru team's football skills are still worthy of being happy and can compete with the Western strong teams. Although there is no outstanding achievement, it is enough to prove the progress of the Chinese football community. Portugal still has no improvement. The British Navy has postponed all recent games because there are no large ships in Shanghai at present. In this session, the Huashi are determined to maintain the championship. The strength of the Western Capture team is particularly strong, having overwhelmed Huasais 4-0. The Shanghai Westerners and Lacks teams are not weak. The recent results of each team are as follows:</p>
<p>Team Name, Games Played, Wins, Losses, Draws, Goals For, Goals Against, Points</p>
<p>Huashi, 3, 3, 0, 0, 18, 1, 6</p>

<p>The Chinese Football Club has been playing for a month since the start of the competition. There were originally ten teams in the Middle Character Group. Initially, the Fudan and Tongji teams successively requested to withdraw, leaving eight existing teams. However, it is said that the Baota team has also withdrawn and has been approved. Each team has only played six games one after another. The past two weeks have been suspended due to rain, which is really unfortunate. The Lingnan team has always been known for its reputation. This time, the famous general Chen Pu has joined, which makes it even more outstanding. The strength of Zhenru is known to be strong. The Youyou team, last year's runner-up, seems to have been inferior this year. The Qingnian team has not yet played, so there is no way to know how strong it is. The current results of each team are listed on the left. Team Name, Games Played, Wins, Losses, Draws, Goals For, Goals Against, Points Lingnan, 2, 2, 0, 0, 27, 3, 4 Zhenru, 1, 1, 0, 0, 12, 0, 2 Fudan, 1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 2, 2 Three-One, 2, 1, 1, 0, 14, 5, 2 Youyou, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 12, 2 Baota, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 7, 0 Le-One, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 33, 0 Qingnian, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0</p>

<p>Yesterday was the third week of the Municipal First Public Stadium Small Football Competition. After a long rain, the field was dust-free and the spirits were doubled for the battle. The results are recorded as a sign of excitement.</p>
<p>Group, Winning Team, Score, Referee</p>
<p>Light-A, Small Friend Shiguang, Victory against Light-B, 1-0, Zhang Longhai</p>
<p>Healthy Children, Chao Wei, Tied with Black-E, 2-2, Jia Jiliang</p>

<p>Healthy Children, Middle-C, Victory against Tonghui, 1-0, Zhang Longhai</p>
<p>World-C, Victory against Chenguang, 4-1, Zhang Longhai</p>
<p>First Song and Health are the two heroes of the Youth Group. Yesterday, they met, and they all regarded the championship as the key to success. The three armies before and after worked hard, with the intention of fighting to the death, but the ball was suddenly east and west, and the change was uncertain, showing the appearance of equal strength. Looking at the approaching quarter of an hour, First Song had the opportunity for the right forward Bao Daming to dribble the ball forward. The Health inside guard flew to block the way. Bao lightly kicked the ball to the left forward Xiao Xintian. Xiao was quick-eyed and quick-footed and kicked the ball into the net. During the middle serve, Duren refused to go out. The center forward Zhang Guanxiang took the ball and directly attacked the enemy alone. He turned over and kicked it accurately. In the first half, First Song won two goals. In the second half, Health held the determination to break the boat and attacked desperately, rushing horizontally and vertically like a swift wind and rain, and the ball often wandered within the First Song position. Relying on the central defender Du Renlin and the left guard Lin Shouye to resist, although the dangerous situation was endless, they finally maintained their defense and still won the final victory with a score of 2-0.</p>

It is estimated that he will arrive in Shanghai at about 6:00 AM this morning, but because the Fourth Plenary Session is about to open, he may sail directly to Beijing without stopping in Shanghai. The guard captain Wang Shihe led a team of 140 people and first took the Xin Ning Shao wheel the night before and arrived at the 16th Pier wharf at 7:00 AM yesterday morning.

<h3 id="e114">Captured in Xiadian Village, Hefei County, Anhui <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Brought Back by Shen Jinghua, the County Public Security Bureau Chief</p>
<p>Zhao Tieqiao, former commissioner of the China Merchants Bureau, was assassinated in June of this year. The murderer had been at large and had not been apprehended. Recently, Shen Jinghua, the chief of the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau, received a tip-off detailing that the murderer fled to his ancestral home in Xiadian Village, Hefei County, Anhui, after assassinating Zhao. He then dispatched detectives to investigate and confirm the information before personally going to Anhui to make the arrest. Yesterday, Chief Shen and detectives Gu Xingzhou, Chen Yibing, Lü Hailong, and Hou Guicong escorted the captured murderer, Xia Shaoen, back to Shanghai. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Brief Biography of the Murderer: The murderer, Xia Shaoen, is 30 years old, from Xiadian Village, 30 li east of Hefei County, Anhui Province. He was a farmer. His father died early, and he has a grandmother over 80 years old, a mother over 60 years old, and a wife, Qian, who is 29 years old. In the spring of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), she came to Shanghai with Xia and gave birth to a daughter, who is now five years old and is being cared for by Xia's mother at home. According to Xia, after arriving in Shanghai in the spring of the 17th year of the Republic, he lived at a certain address on a certain road (the exact address will not be announced for the time being) and made a small business selling face cream. After the incident, he stayed in Shanghai for more than a month to listen to the news. Later, due to the news of the reward for his arrest, the news became more urgent, so he left Shanghai alone and returned to his ancestral home in Anhui. His wife still resides in Shanghai to listen to the news from Shanghai and communicate from time to time.</p>
<p>Details of the Capture: Shen Jinghua, the chief of the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau, believed that although the Zhao case occurred in the concession, he, as a member of the Public Security Bureau, should arrest the true culprit and bring him to justice to fulfill the duties of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau and to prevent the false accusation of others. Therefore, he sent detectives to investigate and learned that Xia Shaoen was the real culprit in the Zhao case and had fled to Hefei. Therefore, on October 18, the county government issued an order to the Public Security Bureau to prepare passports and ordered county detectives Gu Xingzhou, Chen Yibing, and Lü Hailong to take the case passports and a pistol to Hefei to investigate and arrest the suspect. However, after the three men arrived in Hefei, their pistols were exposed in a small teahouse, and the third branch of the Hefei County Public Security Bureau and the Chamber of Commerce Security Corps suspected them of being villains and arrested them. After each of them produced their passports to prove their identity, the Hefei Public Security Bureau telegraphed the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau for confirmation, and the three detectives were released and Xia was arrested. However, due to the remote road of thousands of miles and the difficulty of extraditing prisoners from another province, Chief Shen personally went to Hefei on October 30 with detective Hou Guicong to bring Xia back.</p>
<p>The Situation Along the Way: After Chief Shen arrived in Hefei, he contacted all parties and began escorting the suspect Xia Shaoen by long-distance bus to Wuhu on the night of the 4th of this month with the four detectives who had gone there earlier. On the afternoon of the 7th, they took the Jiang'an steamship of the China Merchants Bureau downstream to Zhenjiang. At 3:30 a.m. on the 8th, Chief Shen transferred to the Beijing-Shanghai train in Zhenjiang and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. He went directly to the China Merchants Wharf on the Bund to explain the reason for bringing the prisoner to the police on duty to prevent any unexpected incidents. At 7:10 a.m., the Jiang'an steamship arrived at the shore. Four detectives, Gu Xingzhou, Chen Bingyi, Lü Hailong, and Hou Guicong, escorted Xia to the shore. Chief Shen led the way to the county government and detained him in the Public Security Bureau. Although the murderer has been arrested, the travel expenses and other expenses of Chief Shen and the detectives amount to more than 800 yuan. The fact that Gu, Chen, and Lü were previously detained and tortured by the Third Branch of the Hefei Public Security Bureau still needs to be negotiated after the case is closed.</p>
<p>Appearance of the Murderer: After the murderer Xia Shaoen entered the county Public Security Bureau, Chief Shen ordered him to be detained in the patrol room in the west room downstairs and rented a cotton quilt and blanket for him to keep warm. The reporter of the Daily News wanted to see the appearance of Xia, so he led the secretary and patrol leader of the Public Security Bureau to visit Xia. Xia's face was plump and did not look like a small business owner. His hair was flat-topped, but the hair was long and seemed to be uncut. He wore a blue cloth wrapped around his head, imitating the appearance of a farmer in Anhui Province. He wore a dark blue cotton jacket and pants, which were old and dirty. His eyes showed fierceness and his face was red, indicating that he was uneasy.</p>

If no measures are taken to restrict this, they will all perish together. Please request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to stop issuing passports to that port. As for the overseas Chinese shops and households already in that port who wish to come from their home country, they must have their passports stamped by the Association and request your Ministry to inform them to reissue their passports.' The Ministry has replied and requested you to check and handle the matter. Temporarily stop issuing passports to Denearara. Please comply with this order."

<h3 id="e117">Letter to All Citizens of the City <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Issued in Commemoration of the Premier's Birthday</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters, in view of the Premier's upcoming birthday, in addition to stipulating measures to actively prepare for the celebration, also issued a letter to all citizens of the city as follows:</p>
<p>Revolutionary Citizens, the Premier is the Father of the Republic of China, the creator of the Chinese Kuomintang, the inventor of the Three People's Principles, and the mentor of the world revolution. Conversely, if there were no Premier, there would be no Republic of China, no Chinese Kuomintang, no Three People's Principles, no mentor of the world revolution. Without the mentor of the world revolution, the weak and small nations of the world would have lost a guiding light. Without the Three People's Principles,</p>
<p>we would not have the revolutionary principles of saving China and saving the world. Without the Chinese Kuomintang, we would not have the leading revolutionary organization. Without the Republic of China, our Chinese nation would not have escaped the oppression of the imperial system of the Qing Dynasty. Therefore, the Premier's birthday is not only the savior of the Chinese nation, but also the savior of all oppressed nations in the world. The Premier's birthday should be celebrated and commemorated not only by the Chinese nation, but also by all of humanity. The Premier was determined to make revolution at the age of twenty, and for forty years, his sincerity was unwavering.</p>
<p>The Premier himself, from birth to death, can be said to be a revolutionary history of saving China and saving the world. Due to the Premier's lifelong efforts, the deep-rooted foundation of the imperial system for more than two hundred and sixty years was overthrown, the illusion of the imperialist division of China was shattered, the seeds of the establishment of the Chinese revolution were planted, and the way out for the world revolution was opened up. These unprecedented great revolutionary undertakings are all the manifestations of the Premier's lifelong efforts. Therefore, the progress of the Chinese National Revolution today and the establishment of China's peaceful reunification are all inspired by the Premier's great sincerity. This is what we must recognize. Due to this recognition, we dare to judge that all anti-Three People's Principles and counter-revolutionary forces, whether they are domestic counter-revolutionary forces such as Yan, Feng, and Wang, or foreign red and white imperialist</p>
<p>counter-revolutionary forces, or all counter-revolutionary forces lurking at home and abroad, will only end up in collapse and annihilation. At the same time, we dare to judge that the world revolution takes the success of the Chinese National Revolution as a condition. The success of the Chinese revolution is the success of the world revolution. Therefore, not only the entire Chinese nation and people must strive to participate in and complete the National Revolution, but also all oppressed nations and people in the world should strive to participate in and support the Chinese National Revolution. Revolutionary citizens, although China has now destroyed the oppression of the feudal warlords, how to appease the people in the north, ensure the safety of the people's livelihood throughout the country, and all construction projects have not been carried out. Although China has now regained the dawn of peaceful reunification, the oppression of red and white imperialism and the remnants of unequal treaties have still not been completely eliminated. The Chinese National Revolution is now at a very dangerous and serious stage. If we cannot overcome this very dangerous and serious period, then the National Revolution will only be aborted, and the lives of the entire Chinese nation and people will only be pulled down. Revolutionary citizens, revolution demands a better survival, but now the entire Chinese nation and people not only cannot seek a better survival, but also the inherent survival is oppressed by the aggressive imperialists and international economic forces so that it cannot move. Therefore, our future revolutionary target should be aimed at the imperialists, and we must break free from the oppression of the imperialists and abolish all unequal treaties. At the same time, we also know that revolution is construction, not destruction, and it is to destroy for construction, not to destroy for destruction. Therefore, now that the dawn of peaceful reunification has been seen again, we can only strive to promote construction projects and move towards the path of non-capitalist construction. We especially strive to promote and complete the most important local autonomy in construction projects. Revolutionary citizens, destruction is difficult, and construction is even more difficult. Whether we can overcome the current difficulties depends on whether we can</p>
<p>bear the responsibility of construction. Whether we can complete the Chinese National Revolution and even the world revolution also depends on whether we can strive to complete China's most difficult and arduous construction projects. Our slogans are: (1) Celebrate the Premier's birthday (2) Overthrow red and white imperialism (3) Abolish all unequal treaties (4) Shoot Yan Xishan, Feng Yuxiang, and Wang Jingwei (5) Support the Commander-in-Chief (6) Strive for political tutelage and construction (7) The Premier's spirit is immortal (8) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang (9) Long live the Republic of China (10) Long live the success of the National Revolution The Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang</p>

<h3 id="e121">Telegraphed for Methods to Relieve the Fishing Industry <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>

<p>Negotiating Japanese Vessels' Encroachment on Fishing</p>
<h3 id="e122">Safeguarding Fishermen's Livelihoods <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Nanjing. A letter from member Jin Chuxiang states: "Millions of people in the coastal provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong rely entirely on fishing for a living. In recent years, piracy has been rampant, customs duties are not good, and anti-smuggling is extorting. Fishermen are suffering from oppression, and millions have lost their jobs. The strong take risks and join bandits, while the weak sit and wait for death, all becoming starving corpses. Although the government is thinking of providing relief, there are no proper methods. Strong powers such as Japan and the United States are taking the opportunity to transport large quantities of fish to China, such as Japanese and Russian salmon and American blue mackerel, etc., amounting to tens of millions of dan per year. Residents find them easy to sell due to their low prices. Domestic fish are subject to heavy taxes and bandit disturbances, so the fishing industry has no possibility of development. This is the indirect killing of our fishermen by imperialists. There are also those who directly kill our fishermen, that is, Japanese fishing vessels that catch fish in the seas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang and transport them to Shanghai for sale at very low prices. There are dozens of such fishing vessels, and they transport very quickly. Merchants are benefiting from the commission, but they do not know that the price of sailboat fish cannot be sold, and the livelihoods of fishermen are exhausted. Six methods are proposed below: (1) Please have the Ministry of Foreign Affairs negotiate with Japan to prevent Japanese vessels from fishing across the sea. (2) Please order the National Government to prohibit fish merchants across the country from selling Japanese vessel fish. (3) Improve salt tax (4) Severely punish smuggling extortion (5) Jointly suppress pirates by land, sea, and air forces (6) Dispatch officials to help fishermen's livelihood and emphasize national rights," etc. The original letter states that the encroachment of Japanese vessels on fishing was initially limited to Zhili and later extended to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. When our country negotiated with them, they claimed that the area covered by the fishing vessels was within the scope of the high seas and did not encroach on China's territorial waters. Therefore, after several years, there has been no result, and the interests of our country's fishing industry are being lost day by day. According to the old international law, the width of territorial waters was three nautical miles. Later, with the advancement of firearms, various countries had different opinions on the three-nautical-mile rule and could not strictly abide by it. The Hague Peace Conference convened to compile the League of Nations Law Conference, and there were many disputes about the width of territorial waters, which have not been resolved. The Navy Department believes that the three-nautical-mile rule is sufficient to gain an advantage based on our country's topography, but it has not fully considered the interests of our country's territorial waters and fishing industry or the recent encroachment by the Japanese. It should be requested that the Navy Department be consulted again for a long-term discussion. As for whether the area encroached on by the Japanese over the years is within the scope of the high seas or involves our country's territorial waters, why should we take the word of the Japanese? It should be requested that the Navy Department be consulted to send warships to patrol regularly during the fishing season. If there are Japanese vessels crossing the border, they should be expelled to prevent the sprout of spying. As for the rampant piracy, it is reported in the newspapers every day, and the government should be aware of it without the need for further description. Officials raising soldiers has become a problem of the heart and stomach, and the people along the coast are suffering every day. It should be requested that the Ministry present the case to the court and transfer it to the government to dispatch land, sea, and air forces to conduct a thorough search and suppression to ensure that the roots are completely eradicated and expelled from the country. In this way, the sea frontier will be pacified, and the fishing industry will be blessed. Also, regarding the improvement of the salt tax, according to common practice, the tax rate for industrial salt should be lighter than that for edible salt. Our country has not been able to handle this type of salt separately. Recently, the soy sauce industry has been feeling the burden of the salt tax, and business is increasingly declining. It should be requested that the Ministry of Finance be consulted to re-examine and determine the tax rates for various industrial salts and reduce the collection separately. As for the difficulties in smuggling mentioned in the original letter, the fishing salt used by fishing boats is taxed and issued by the fishing factory, and the ships are distributed according to the certificate. The fish factory transports the certificate back to the official salt ship for cancellation. Therefore, each fishing boat has no certificate to carry, and there have always been precedents for official agencies to check it. In recent years, the Anti-Smuggling Bureau has repeatedly detained fishing boats. Even if the fishing boats are released after citing precedents, the losses of the fishing boats are still considerable. It should be requested that the Ministry of Finance order the anti-smuggling officials to strictly warn that all these situations were not mentioned in the original letter. Adding more explanations is reasonable, and it is appropriate to telegraph and request the Ministry to examine and approve them separately for implementation to maintain the fishing industry for public benefit.

<p>Silk Factory Representatives Return to Shanghai</p>
<h3 id="e123">Meeting to Report Progress Tomorrow <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The silk factory owners in this port are unable to maintain their business due to the sluggish sales and losses of silk factories and have announced shutdowns by public agreement. It was resolved to request the government to issue 10 million yuan of public bonds for the silk industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai to relieve the silk market. Five representatives, including Shen Huachen, Wang Xiaolai, Huang Jinchen, Zhu Jing'an, and Huang Jinfan, were elected to go to Beijing with representatives from Wuxi and other places in Zhejiang to petition. However, more than 20 factories, including Ruilun, which had not stopped work, were unable to support the increasingly sluggish European sales and were shut down at the end of last month. The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Silk Factory Association, in view of the increasingly serious problem of the shutdown of silk factories in Shanghai, immediately telegraphed the Chairman Shen and others who had gone to Beijing to petition, requesting them to return to Shanghai as soon as possible after the matter was completed. Chairman Shen and others arrived in Shanghai at 5:00 a.m. yesterday by special express train from Beijing. It is now scheduled to convene a meeting of all silk factory owners in Shanghai at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow (Tuesday, the 11th) to report on the progress of the petition and to discuss the issue of starting work as soon as possible. A notice has already been issued yesterday.</p>
<p>Various Trade Unions</p>
<h3 id="e124">Safeguard the Lives of Workers <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Order Factories and Shops</p>
<p>Improve Fire Prevention</p>
<p>The various trade unions of Shanghai submitted a document to the Municipal Social Bureau, requesting to seriously</p>
<p>crack down on all factories and shops in the city that do not have adequate fire prevention equipment, and to order each employer to be responsible for protecting the safety of the employees before the equipment is improved, in order to maintain life and prevent danger. The unions have seen the tragic deaths of many workers in the Huakang Road Fuchang Military Clothing Factory and the Tiande Road Rongchangxiang Military Clothing Factory, which did not have adequate fire prevention equipment. The suffering of the victims is deeply felt by those who have witnessed it. It is deeply felt that employees in factories and shops with inadequate fire prevention equipment are everywhere at risk of death. It cannot be denied that all factories in the city are simplifying fire prevention due to their simple and crude conditions, and there are even more people who disregard the lives of their workers for the sake of saving money and have no preparations at all. Once a fire occurs, it cannot be stopped, and it is bound to cause all the workers to be buried in the fire. Even in stores, after closing the market, they must tightly lock the traffic doors and windows, and the key is in the hands of one person. The employer believes that this is enough to prevent theft and prevent employees from going out. If a sudden change occurs, the key holder may lose consciousness due to shock, or be the first to be harmed and lose the key. The door cannot be opened, and there is no way to escape. The lives of those living together will inevitably perish together. Thinking of this, I cannot help but shudder. Therefore, I venture to represent the workers and ask for instructions from the Bureau, requesting that you have mercy and severely crack down on the above-mentioned factories and shops, ordering them to improve. Before complying with the order to improve, order each employer to be responsible for protecting the safety of the employees, in order to maintain life and prevent danger.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Re-examination and Reduction of Import Tax on Cowhide</p>
<h3 id="e125">Telegram to the Ministry of Finance Requesting Maintenance of Overseas Chinese Livelihoods <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the import tax on red tanned cowhide, the Chamber of Commerce has twice requested a reduction, as reported in various newspapers. However, after a considerable time, no definitive announcement has been received from the Ministry of Finance. The Chamber of Commerce believes that the increase or decrease of this tax rate is related to the livelihoods of overseas Chinese and has therefore submitted another petition to the Ministry of Finance, stating: "To the esteemed Nanjing Ministry of Finance: This association, based on the second request from the local Red Tanned Cowhide Trade Association, telegraphed your ministry on September 25th, requesting that the import tax rate on red tanned cowhide from Southeast Asia be promptly reduced. On October 13th, your ministry responded with notification number 11139, acknowledging receipt of the telegram and stating that the matter concerned the revision of tariff regulations, and had previously been forwarded to the National Tariff Commission for consideration. Now that the period for revising import tariffs has arrived, amendments should be awaited as the commission comprehensively considers and finalizes them. The request for prompt reduction is difficult to comply with, etc. After the association recorded this response, it was forwarded. On the 5th of this month, a letter was received from the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce stating: 'Red tanned cowhide is a crucial business for overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. In recent years, due to the sudden increase in import tax rates by our national customs, which is unfair, sales have been rejected by European and American goods, resulting in significant losses. Many leather factories have already declared closure. Not only are many overseas Chinese merchants unemployed, but even more overseas Chinese laborers are out of work. At a time when rubber and tin mining in our port have repeatedly failed and all industries are declining, how can we further add to the unemployment caused by red tanned cowhide? The unemployment in this industry will not only lead to the decline of the leather industry in our port but also cause our counterparts in your port to suffer the same hardship. To maintain domestic and foreign trade, our chamber has submitted a petition through the resident Tang Consul in Singapore to the national government to revise the import tax rate on red tanned cowhide. Now, according to a letter from your Red Tanned Cowhide Trade Association, we are grateful for your concern for commerce and deep consideration for overseas Chinese affairs, and have already jointly petitioned the Ministry of Finance to revise the tax rate, etc. Upon hearing this, we are filled with admiration. Our chamber, on behalf of all manufacturers in our port's red tanned cowhide industry, expresses our sincere gratitude to your association. Aside from sending a letter requesting your Red Tanned Cowhide Trade Association to prepare samples and submit them to the Jianghai Customs for examination, we believe that if the tax rate is not revised, the leather factories in our port will not be able to resume operations for even a single day, and your leather industry counterparts in your port will also suffer losses every day. This situation greatly impacts domestic and foreign trade. We hope your association will sympathize with overseas Chinese and make a thorough effort to urge our national government to approve the revision of the import tax rate on red tanned cowhide in the shortest possible time so that the leather factories in our port and your leather industry counterparts can resume operations. This is our earnest hope, etc.' Considering that in British Singapore, following the restriction of rubber and tin mining production, countless overseas Chinese businesses have gone bankrupt, and the number of overseas Chinese laborers returning to China is increasing daily, while British territories have restrictions on immigration, our country, which has always relied on the islands of Southeast Asia as an overseas colony, is now on the verge of failure. The chamber's urgent request to reduce the import tax rate on red tanned cowhide to allow the factories to resume operations is indeed a crucial plan to maintain the livelihoods of overseas Chinese. Using the import of silkworm cocoons as an example, the Ministry of Finance reduced the import tariff rate from 12.5% to 7.5% with a ministerial order informing the customs to implement it, without first submitting it to the National Tariff Commission for review. Therefore, there is precedent for the chamber's request for a swift revision. Moreover, the National Tariff Commission's draft for revising import tariffs is rumored to have been prepared long ago and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for passage, lacking only the formality of being promulgated by the National Government. The ministry's instruction, stating that it has already been forwarded to the National Tariff Commission, leaves doubt as to whether the commission has adopted the industry's suggestions and included them in the draft submitted to the Legislative Yuan, as no clear announcement has been made. Based on the aforementioned circumstances, we jointly telegraphed your ministry again to request your careful review and swift remedial measures, providing a detailed reply to alleviate the industry's dire situation, for the public good."</p>
<p>Sun Kui-fang Provides a Detailed Account of the Examination Process in the Xuan A-xiang Case</p>
<h3 id="e126">No Negligence in Self-Adjustment of Duties <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>According to the Guomin She, the Xuan A-xiang case has recently attracted considerable attention in Shanghai. Here, Mr. Sun Kui-fang, Director of the Preparatory Office of the Forensic Examination Institute of the Ministry of Justice, provides a detailed account of the true facts of the examination as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e127">The Nature and Responsibility of Forensic Medicine <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Recently, various newspapers in Shanghai have published reports on the forensic examination in the Xuan A-xiang case that are largely inaccurate. There are also various misunderstandings about Mr. Kui-fang personally and the Forensic Examination Office. In our country, where forensic medicine is not yet well-developed, inaccurate reports are not surprising, and personal defamation is not worth arguing about. However, I believe that the development of forensic medicine in our country is just beginning. The authorities are determined to improve it and are establishing a forensic research institute in Zhenru to lay the foundation for the future development of forensic medicine. If society loses faith in forensic medicine from the outset, it will have a significant impact on the future of judicial reform. Therefore, I do not hesitate to be tedious in providing a detailed account of the examination process in this case so that those who understand forensic medicine can make appropriate criticisms, and those who do not understand forensic medicine will not be too ignorant of the truth. The transmission of a new academic discipline and the rise of a new career inevitably face considerable resistance. Even in the case of ordinary medicine, the influence of Western medicine in the country today is still far below that of traditional medicine. Furthermore, the introduction of forensic medicine has been even more delayed, and it is not surprising that there are many doubts and confusions. It is hoped that members of society will make calm judgments based on factual evidence and not be swayed by rumors and gossip so that the future of judicial reform will not be excessively hindered, and our country's examination affairs will not be dominated by the "Washed Grievances" and the coroner system for a long time. Scientific research places the utmost importance on evidence.</p>
<p>Forensic methods also focus on physical evidence. From physical evidence, the cause of death can be inferred. However, the same cause of death can be achieved through various actions and methods. What is the true act or method that caused the injury or death? It is necessary to refer to the testimony of witnesses and material evidence outside the body to determine this. For example, if the actions and facts presented by the witness can lead to the cause of death determined by the appraisal and can explain the characteristics of each part of the body without contradiction, the forensic doctor can explain that the evidence is reasonable. However, it cannot be said to be absolutely true because the truthfulness of evidence outside the body is the responsibility of the person in charge of investigation and appraisal and is not within the scope of the forensic doctor's jurisdiction. However, if it is consistent with various characteristics, it is sufficient to constitute extremely strong evidence. Conversely, if the circumstances presented by the witness cannot constitute the cause of death identified by the forensic doctor, the forensic doctor must assume that there are other actions to make a reasonable explanation. As for the existence or absence of other actions, the evidence must be based on: first, the phenomena on the body to determine the cause of death, which is entirely within the scope of the forensic doctor; and second, the integration of evidence outside the body obtained in court with the characteristics examined on the body to infer a reasonable explanation for the cause of death. This is not entirely within the scope of the forensic doctor because the investigation and collection of other evidence outside the body are not within the forensic doctor's duties. The forensic doctor can only determine whether this evidence can be connected with the cause of death and provide an explanation to provide the court with a reference and the investigation with a guideline. If there are unknown facts in the initial investigation of the court, and therefore the cause of death cannot be explained, the forensic doctor has no choice but to speculate that there are other actions besides the evidence. When new facts are discovered that can lead to the cause of death and there are no other actions sufficient to constitute the cause of death as evidence to the contrary, the forensic doctor can change his explanation based on the newly obtained facts. However, as long as the cause of death is not mistaken, the forensic doctor's appraisal cannot be said to be wrong because the forensic doctor cannot anticipate the discovery of new evidence by the court and provide an explanation in advance. Before there is new evidence, it is necessary to make other reasonable explanations. There is also a famous case in forensic medicine that is sufficient to clarify the position of forensic medicine. The knife marks of suicide and homicide usually have obvious distinctions. Suicide knife marks are oblique, running from top to bottom, with the direction being from left to right. This is a common characteristic. Someone once died in a bedroom. The mark on his neck was exactly the same as this. From the perspective of forensic medicine, it is most appropriate to interpret it as suicide. Therefore, the forensic doctor at the time made this appraisal first. After further detailed investigation, it was found that the fingerprints on the knife did not match the deceased's fingerprints, and the distance between the knife and the body was too far, which was also suspicious. Therefore, the investigators, based on the fingerprints, investigated the murderer and were fortunate enough to capture him. When asked about the circumstances of the murder, it turned out that the victim was bowing his head in front, and the murderer bent over behind him to kill him. The state of the injury was completely similar to suicide. Therefore, the forensic doctor had to change his explanation. However, this kind of two-way explanation before and after would not damage the value of forensic medicine but rather increase its reputation. Therefore, the change of explanation is not a problem. The only thing that matters is that the appraisal of the cause of death is consistent with the phenomenon.</p>
<h3 id="e128">The Examination and Process of the Xuan A-xiang Case <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Now that the nature of forensic medicine and its responsibilities are clear, we can proceed to describe the examination process in the Xuan A-xiang case. However, before describing these facts, there are still some procedures that must be briefly mentioned. During foreign forensic examinations, the court submits the records of the prosecutor's investigation and witness statements to the forensic doctor so that the physical evidence can be compared with this evidence to determine the cause of death and identify whether other evidence is reliable. Because the Shanghai Special District Local Court did not have its own examination site and because of time constraints, it could not be handled in this way. The daily procedure was that in the morning, each police station sent the application forms for court examination to the court. The prosecutor and forensic doctor reviewed the forms one by one and then went to the Yishi Institute of the Public Concession on Fielun Road to examine the bodies. Because of time constraints, after the prosecutor briefly inspected the body, he held a court session to question the witnesses, while the forensic doctor stayed in the examination room to examine the body. Therefore, the forensic doctor's preliminary appraisal was based on the body as physical evidence. As for other circumstances, he could only tentatively rely on the information reported by the police station. The examination of the Xuan A-xiang case was no exception to this procedure. First, the original text of the police station report is recorded below: (Xuan A-xiang, an 18-year-old female, died suddenly at 1:40 pm on September 19, 1930. Zhang Xiao-gui, who lives at 421 Taopeng Road, reported that his niece A-xiang died suddenly at 711 Yangshupu Road with her husband Xu A-san.) Note that this is a false report by Qian A-cai Police Station. ) The report claimed that there was a verbal argument on September 18th at 7 PM when her husband hit her head several times. The next morning, her husband said that his wife (the deceased) was ill and then sent her to Yangshupu Hospital by car. She died before arriving at the hospital. The body was sent to the examination center to await examination. September 20th, Huishan Police Station) The above is the evidence outside the body. Now let's talk about the examination of the body. (1) External examination: Initially, the external examination immediately noted a bloodstain on the left cheekbone of Qian Xuan, with two ridges imprinted on it. However, this was not sufficient to cause death. The prosecutor asked the witness whether she had taken opium. Whether the deceased died from taking opium or whether there was another cause of death could not be determined by external examination and could not be clarified without an autopsy. Therefore, an autopsy was performed. (2) Autopsy: The autopsy originally focused on opium poisoning. Unexpectedly, after opening the chest and abdomen, multiple bleeding spots were found on the lower part of the front of the left and right lungs, which were signs of suffocation. Therefore, suspicion began. The two lungs were taken out one after the other, and the bleeding spots on the lower part of the back were more numerous than those on the front. There were also multiple bleeding spots on the pleura. The heart was opened, and several bleeding spots were found in it, and there was a blood clot in the heart. These bleeding spots, also known as Tardieu's spots, are a unique phenomenon caused by death due to suffocation. The causes of death due to suffocation are mostly due to blockage of the throat tube, except for several diseases. After the phenomenon of suffocation was discovered, the neck had to be searched. After opening the neck skin, blood clots were also found in the muscles of the two major neck tendons, but the outer skin was not injured. Therefore, these blood clots could not but be suspected of being caused by a soft, thick object wrapped around the neck and pressed hard, resulting in internal injury. After opening the scalp, there were round and square bruises inside the scalp. These bruises were also injuries sustained before death. Combining the above external examination and internal autopsy results, there were the following points: (1) There were bloodstains on the face with ridges imprinted on them. (2) The head was injured before death with bruises inside. (3) There were obvious signs of death due to suffocation inside the heart and lungs. (4) There were also bleeding spots in the muscles inside the neck. Combining these points with the information reported by the police station, it could not but be suspected that the deceased was pressed on a table or bed by someone, with her head wrapped in something, and her neck was forcibly suppressed, resulting in death due to suffocation. At the same time, blood vessel dilation and bleeding of the inner lining of the stomach were also found in the stomach (this phenomenon is the same as that found in those who take opium), and the witness also testified that she had taken opium when the prosecutor questioned her. Therefore, the contents of the stomach had to be chemically examined to complete the examination procedure. However, our country's courts do not have drug testing equipment and have to rely on the Public Concession Health Department for chemical examination. What was requested from the Public Concession Health Department was the result of chemical examination, not an opinion on the cause of death, because no one who has not seen the entire examination can determine that death was necessarily caused by the presence of toxic substances in the stomach. It should be noted that the various signs of suffocation mentioned above were not all caused by ordinary opium poisoning, but were entirely signs of suffocation. Even without the ingestion of opium, this suffocation would undoubtedly be sufficient to constitute the cause of death. Since the above cause of death was determined, the Public Concession Health Department was commissioned to test for poison for reference, and the cause of death was explained first. This is the text of the explanation in the first examination report (the bloodstains on her left cheekbone) were caused by someone pressing hard on the back of her head, injuring her face. Her face also touched objects with sharp edges (bed boards or edges), so there were ridge imprints. The bruises on the left side of her hairline and to the left were caused by rectangular blunt objects and punches. The blood clots in the muscles on both sides of her neck (sternocleidomastoid muscles) (i.e., the two major neck tendons) were caused by the perpetrator pressing on both sides of her neck with his hands. There was something padded on the outside (such as a blanket), so there were no injuries on the outer skin, but there were blood clots inside. The bleeding spots on her lungs, heart, and other organs were a unique phenomenon caused by death due to suffocation. According to the above situation, it seems that the perpetrator wrapped the victim's head and body with something like a blanket and also used blunt objects and punches on her head, pressing hard on the back of the victim's head, causing a large bloodstain on the left cheekbone of her upper part, and the ridge of the padding penetrated the skin. There were multiple blood clots in the sternocleidomastoid muscles of her neck, indicating that the perpetrator had pressed hard on the victim's neck, causing the trachea to be blocked, and the victim died due to suffocation. Therefore, there were bleeding spots on her lungs, heart, and other organs. Furthermore, it should be added that Mr. Kui-fang's task in Shanghai was to establish a forensic research institute (formerly the Forensic Examination Office) under the order of the Ministry. To examine cases of body examinations and injuries for the special district local court was to act under commission. Preparing for this required traveling back and forth between Beijing and Shanghai, which took a considerable amount of time, and the local court had to deal with many cases of body examinations and injuries every day. Therefore, although every effort was made to deliver the examination reports quickly, there were occasional delays due to other matters. However, there were never any delays that went unexamined, as reported in the newspapers. (3) Drug testing results: Although the above explanation can explain the cause of death, since there was drug use, a drug test had to be performed at the same time to complete the procedure. Therefore, the stomach was taken out, along with several small pieces of other internal organs and urine, and entrusted to the Public Concession Health Department for examination. The task of the department in this matter was only to report on the results on the certificate and could not express an opinion on the cause of death. Since the entire examination was not known, only finding that there was opium poison could not be used to determine the cause of death, and they were never entrusted to make this assessment. Moreover, determining whether there was poison or not does not require any profound technology, but the Health Department has this equipment. Later, the Health Department's drug testing form only stated that opium poison was found in the stomach and urine. When this form was sent over, Mr. Kui-fang happened to be in Beijing for business, and his colleague in the forensic laboratory sent the testing form to the Prosecutor's Office. After Mr. Kui-fang returned to Shanghai, Judge Feng Shi-de asked whether it could be explained as death due to drug use, as the testing form stated that the stomach and urine contained opium. Mr. Kui-fang replied that although the chemical testing results showed the presence of opium poison, death solely from drug use would not cause the bruises and bleeding spots on the face, head, and internal organs. Before the opium poison took effect, the deceased may have been injured by someone. Therefore, unless there is other evidence sufficient to explain the various phenomena mentioned above, from the forensic point of view, it still cannot be said to be solely death due to drug use. (4) New evidence and second explanation: Judge Feng then stated that, according to the witness's testimony, Xuan A-xiang had been lying on the table since the evening of the 19th until the next morning, and that she was still lying on the table (this statement was not mentioned when the prosecutor questioned her before). Moreover, no other evidence was obtained in court to prove that the deceased died of forcible suffocation. The court could not obtain evidence for the first speculative explanation from afar, but the fact that she was lying on the table could provide a reasonable explanation for the marks on her face and the phenomenon of death due to suffocation. Therefore, based on the circumstances, a second explanation was made as follows: (hereinafter the original text) According to the drug testing certificate issued by the Public Concession Health Department, the stomach fluid and urine of Xuan A-xiang contained a large amount of opium. According to the statements of the witness and the defendant, Xuan A-xiang had an argument with her husband the day before her death, and when she returned home that night, she lay on the table until dawn. Therefore, according to the report of the Public Concession and the statements of the witness and the defendant, the injuries and cause of death described in the examination report of September 25 should be explained separately. The bloodstains on her left cheekbone were caused by the deceased gradually losing her self-control after taking opium, which caused her to rub her face against the table, thus injuring her cheekbone, and the edge of the table penetrated the skin. The blood clots in the sternocleidomastoid muscles of her neck were caused by her head tilting from side to side after losing her self-control, which caused the muscles to stretch beyond their limit, thus there was bleeding in the muscles. The state of death due to suffocation internally was also caused by her covering her mouth and nose with her sleeves after losing her self-control, and she eventually died of suffocation, so there were bleeding spots in the internal organs and lungs. As for the wounds on her head, they were still caused by others before her death. From the above process, it can be seen that the explanations before and after are based on the same cause of death. The first explanation was because the fact that she was lying on the table was unknown, and death solely from drug use could not have caused the aforementioned phenomena. Moreover, the deceased died due to marital discord, so the most recent speculation had to be made, suspecting that there was forcible suffocation. The second explanation was because the forensic doctor did not obtain actual evidence for the first speculation, and the fact that she was lying on the table could explain the phenomena on the body, so it was okay to change it. The difference between the explanations before and after came from evidence outside the body and was not caused by errors in the body examination. The scope of the forensic doctor's responsibilities is limited to showing the court the direction for searching for evidence based on the phenomena of the body, and seeking an understandable explanation by referring to the evidence obtained by the court and the condition of the body. The forensic doctor's responsibilities are limited to this, and it is not within the forensic doctor's jurisdiction to investigate how to search for external evidence and whether it is true or false, detailed or rough. Moreover, in the special circumstances in which Mr. Kui-fang was in, he had no time to ask about it. However, because his first explanation was able to come up with the fact that she was lying on the table, he was fortunate that he had not made any major negligence in his duties. In short, the spirit of forensic medicine is to obtain results from empirical evidence. It cannot prematurely predict facts, nor can it recklessly determine the cause of death regardless of evidence. Although the deceased took opium, if her special posture at the time of death was not sufficient to explain the evidence obtained, a conclusion could not be drawn rashly. All scientific progress is based on the spirit of seeking evidence, and forensic medicine cannot be an exception. As for whether society can understand this, it depends on how well society understands this spirit.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two other matters involving individuals recorded in the newspapers. One is the case of the mentally ill Gua Hu Zhang. This matter is due to the difference between criminal appraisal and ordinary appraisal. I still believe that the appraisal made has never been wrong. Since it involves expertise, it is not necessary to argue about it here. I plan to comment on it in court. What I hope from the people of the country is not to regard the appraisal of the Public Concession as too important and to regard the appraisal of the people of our country as too unimportant. This kind of mentality seems to be temporarily difficult to change in our country, especially in Shanghai, but in the future, there may eventually be a time when they realize their mistake. There is also a matter that Mr. Kui-fang received a large amount of money to travel abroad, and the Shanghai Forensic Examination Office disappeared without a trace. The truth or falsehood of these rumors can be verified by facts, and it is not necessary to argue about them deeply. I only wish to point out that my trip abroad was under the order of the Ministry, and the temporary relocation of the Forensic Examination Preparation Office to Nanjing was also based on the order of the Ministry. The reason for the delay in replying to the newspaper reports this time was that I was preparing for departure procedures in Beijing. Fortunately, I have not started my journey yet, and I can still have the opportunity to answer these rumors. However, as I am about to leave for the West, if there are any more criticisms against individuals, I will have to wait until I return to defend myself. I hereby declare this to avoid misunderstandings.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Yellow Croaker Case Trial Record <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Plaintiff Received Anonymous Letter</p>
<p>Threatening That a Peaceful Settlement Is Required</p>
<p>There Was a Contract for Selling Yellow Croaker</p>
<p>The Debate Concluded, Awaiting Judgment</p>
<p>Wang Fucai from Ningbo, an employee of the American merchant ship *SS Chefoo*, invited his colleague Li Zaichen to Room 13 of the Ningbo Hotel on Dongxinqiao Street in the French Concession on the evening of the 30th of last month, where he demanded 4,000 yuan from Li under false pretenses. The case was uncovered and Wang, along with a suspect named Xu Lihui from Ningbo, was arrested by Chinese detectives Liu Junjie, Shen Dehui, Feng Qi, etc., from the Hongkou Police Station and sent to the Special District Court for questioning. Wang was remanded in custody, and Xu was released on bail of 1,000 yuan pending further investigation. This newspaper reported on this case the day before yesterday. Presiding Judge Ge Zhitian held a continued hearing in court. According to Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police station, during the adjournment, the plaintiff received an anonymous letter stating that the case must be settled peacefully, otherwise there would be unfavorable consequences. The letter was submitted as evidence. The defendant's representative, lawyer Fan Gang, also submitted a contract, stating that the contract was between the plaintiff and the now-defunct heads Zhao Xiuqing and Yang Fucai, for a joint venture of smuggling yellow croaker, which could prove that the plaintiff was accustomed to doing this kind of thing. The plaintiff, Li Zaichen, testified that the contract was not written by him. In March, the former cook heads Yang Fugui, Wang Fucai, and four others smuggled a batch of yellow croaker and asked for my help. The passenger disembarked in Singapore, but was discovered by customs officers at the Italian Wharf and deported ashore. After the ship returned to Shanghai, Yang was dismissed by the Western shipowner, and Wang took over. This time, 18 yellow croakers were smuggled, and I did not receive a single penny, so I reported the arrest and detained the two defendants. Judge Ge had Li write a paper based on the wording of the contract, carefully examined the handwriting, and kept it on file. Xia Shunlai testified that he was the general manager of Chinese affairs for the *SS Chefoo* company. Li Zaichen and Wang Fucai were both hired by me on behalf of the company as heads on the ship. On the 30th of last month, I was in Room 99 of the Dadong Hotel on Nanjing Road because I was ordered by the Western shipowner to replace all the heads, workers, and servants on the ship, a total of more than 30 people, with new ones. Li Zaichen and Wang Fucai arrived one after the other, and soon left. I didn't know anything about their going to the Ningbo Hotel to settle the yellow croaker account. Yang Ahua testified that he helped Wang Fucai as a stoker. This time, the private smuggling of yellow croaker was a joint venture by the plaintiff Li Zaichen, Wang Fucai, and Zhao Xiuqing, totaling US$1,450. This time, Li was the leader, and he said that the distribution of the profits to us assistants would be at their discretion. Questioned, Wang Fucai insisted that the plaintiff and Zhao Xiuqing, Yang Fugui, etc., had signed a contract for private smuggling of yellow croaker, saying that they would share the blessings and share the burdens, but he did not know who wrote the contract. He only knew that he and the plaintiff were actually in the Ningbo Hotel to settle the account for the American yellow croaker they smuggled together. This time, no contract was signed, and the money would be distributed to more than 30 colleagues on the ship after it was obtained. He pointed to the plaintiff and said, "You swallowed this money, your conscience is too black. If you want to prosecute me again, I will report it to your children and grandchildren." When questioned, Xu Lihui firmly denied demanding money from the plaintiff and did not know anything about the yellow croaker smuggling, asking for an investigation. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stood up again and said that according to the special provisions of the US immigration law, although there is no imprisonment, there should be a fine. Because the cost of living in that country is quite high, an American worker's daily wage must be US$4 or 5. If a Chinese person goes to the US, he is willing to accept US$1 or 2 per day, so the US authorities established an immigration bureau to help the country's unemployed workers. Each Chinese is sent back to his country. According to the defendants, the cost of sending each person back is US$1,450, so the plaintiff should get more than 38,000 yuan. Judge Ge ordered the lawyers on both sides to begin the debate. After a while, he ordered the defendant Wang Fucai to be remanded in custody, and Xu Lihui to continue to be released on bail pending the scheduled judgment.</p>
<p>Yu Yunqing Sues</p>
<h3 id="e133">Wife Fled, Unbearable Cohabitation <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Yu is 59 Years Old</p>
<p>His Wife is 42 Years Old</p>
<p>The Children Have Grown Up</p>
<p>But He Firmly Requests a Divorce</p>
<p>Yu Yunqing from Songjiang has filed a lawsuit in the local court against his wife, Ms. Shen, for deserting him and living away from home for a long time, making cohabitation unbearable. He requests a divorce. His statement is roughly as follows: The plaintiff is 59 years old, a native of Songjiang, and currently lives at No. 43 Fumin Road, Dananmen. He married Ms. Shen (42 years old this year) in the 34th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. At first, they lived peacefully and had one son and one daughter each (son named Deng'ao, 18 years old, daughter named Yingu, 22 years old), who are both of marriageable age. Since the 7th year of the Republic of China, the defendant has been degenerating, often associating with hooligans. In the 12th year of the Republic of China, she fled without a trace, taking away a pair of gold bracelets and a suitcase. At that time, a report was filed with the police, but there was no progress. The defendant took advantage of the plaintiff's service in the store and brought four or five hooligans into the plaintiff's home and took away a leather suitcase, clothes, silver dollars, etc., totaling more than a thousand gold. The defendant is unwilling to be a couple with the plaintiff and has been gone for seven years, abandoning the plaintiff as if he were a stranger. Is her intention still questionable? If a formal divorce is not declared, I am afraid of being entangled endlessly. Judge Dong Tong held a hearing and the plaintiff testified to the previous situation, saying that he had now remarried a woman named Li from Hangzhou, because Ms. Shen did not observe the virtues of a woman and had an affair with my cousin, and soon became acquainted with others. The defendant's address is unknown, so she could not be served with a summons and did not appear. The specially appointed lawyer Chen Kuitang appeared in court to object, saying that since the children have grown up, they should come to court to testify. The official instructed the plaintiff to bring his children to court next time to be questioned. Yesterday, the court convened again at 10 a.m. and was presided over by Judge Tong Shenglu in the Ninth Tribunal. The plaintiff Yu Yunqing gave a brief account of the previous situation. When questioned, Yu Deng'ao testified that my mother left around the 9th or 10th year of the Republic of China. Lawyer Chen stated that the plaintiff's complaint stated that the defendant fled in the 12th year of the Republic of China, but his son said that it was around the 9th or 10th year. There is an obvious discrepancy in the details. The defendant may be in Shanghai, but the plaintiff has not conducted a thorough investigation. Moreover, the children born to the defendant have all grown up. If the defendant has committed the seven grounds for divorce, there are still three reasons for not divorcing. Either she has seen the parents-in-law through their old age and burial, or she has nowhere else to go. He asked the court to pay attention. The presiding judge ordered that the matter be verified and handled.</p>
<p>Aunt Sues Widow</p>
<h3 id="e134">Seeking Separation of Family Relationship <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Daughter-in-Law Was Caught in Adultery</p>
<p>During the Trial, the Daughter-in-Law Insisted That She Was Framed</p>
<p>Debate Concluded, Judgment on the 11th</p>
<p>Gao Caijun from Taixian, who opened a rice store at No. 27 Taiyangmiao, Zhabei, died in the 15th year of the Republic of China, leaving behind his wife, Gao Zhang (29 years old), who observed the virtues of a woman. In September of this year, she brought her lover, Feng Yutang, to her home for a secret meeting, when she was reported to the police by Gao Caibei (the husband's younger brother). Feng and Ms. Gao were arrested and taken to the prosecutor's office of the District Court. After the prosecutor questioned them, he dismissed the case and released Feng on bail. Ms. Gao Zhang was also released. After being released, Gao Zhang filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the District Court, demanding that her husband's younger brother, Gao Caibei, distribute the property (about 10,000 gold, divided into two shares). After hearing the case, it was rejected. Now, Gao Lu, the aunt of Gao Zhang, has hired lawyer Ye Fukang to file a lawsuit in the District Court, requesting to separate from her daughter-in-law Gao Zhang. Her statement is roughly as follows: The defendant Gao Zhang has committed adultery, which has damaged the reputation of the family. The defendant is the plaintiff's daughter-in-law. Since her son's death, she has been restless, and people have been gossiping. At first, there was no evidence, but on the night of the 18th of September of this year, at 1:00 a.m., Feng Yutang blatantly broke into the daughter-in-law's room for a secret meeting. The plaintiff's second son, Caibei, suddenly heard a loud noise coming from the defendant's room, so he reported it to the police, who broke in and arrested the defendant and Feng together and transferred them to the Fourth District Bureau, which then transferred them to your court's prosecutor's office. After investigating, the defendant's adultery has harmed public morals. Therefore, I request to separate from her. The defendant Gao Zhang also hired lawyer Yan Lunkui to present a defense, saying that the plaintiff's complaint has no basis and that a news report in the newspaper is the only reliable evidence. The defendant is completely pure and self-respecting and has never had any improper behavior. Even if she had improper behavior, as the plaintiff said, she had an affair with Feng Yutang. Can a newspaper report be used as evidence? The defendant was brought to the Gao family as a child bride by her father, Zhang Buhua, when she was eight years old. When she grew up, she married Gao Caijun, the eldest son of Gao Lu. Caijun died at the age of 26. It has been four years since then. If the defendant is really a born slut and can sleep with anyone, then the scandal should have spread long ago. Moreover, Feng Yutang is a close friend of her husband's younger brother, Gao Caibei, and is also the godfather of Caibei's daughter, Xiaomaotou. Therefore, Feng once confessed that he was actually instigated by Caibei to seduce the defendant and force her to marry him. In the plaintiff's original complaint, she said that a chaste widow is legally entitled to inherit her husband's share, which means that she has no regard for the son of the deceased (the son of the deceased is five years old) and only recognizes that the widow has the right to inherit her husband's share. Is it not enough to slander her with adultery to seize the widow's share of the property? If she can harm an adult widow today, it is hard to guarantee that she will not harm a minor orphan in the future. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Keqian opened the Fourth Tribunal to hear the case. Both parties came with their lawyers. The plaintiff Gao Lu gave an account of the matter. (Question) Have you ever reconciled outside of court? (Answer) I agreed to give 300 yuan, but the defendant wanted 700 yuan, so it was not resolved. The judge ordered the defendant Gao Zhang to deny the adultery in the case. The judge said, "If you didn't have an affair with Feng Yutang, how could you have Feng's clothes in your room?" The former prosecutor did not prosecute because your husband was dead, so adultery was not established. The defendant insisted that she was framed. "My husband had a share of the family property, and I want to live with my son. I never said I wanted 700 yuan. The plaintiff asked someone to say to me to give me 800 yuan, but I didn't agree." At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer stood up and said that Feng Yutang was caught naked at the time and confessed that he had been having an affair for three years. The defendant said that the plaintiff had a great intention to plot for money. Then the debate began, and the judge considered the conclusion to be set for judgment at 2:00 p.m. on the 11th of this month.</p>
<p>Various Fellow Associations</p>
<h3 id="e135">Publish Declaration on the Xin Case <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>*Riri News* reports that various fellow provincial associations in Shanghai yesterday issued a declaration on the case of Xin Dingxiang, stating: (In recent years, our Chinese people have often been slaughtered by imperialists. The major cases include the Shaji Massacre, the Wanzhou Incident, the May Thirtieth Movement, and the May Third Incident. The humiliation and shame are deeply known to the Chinese people. As for the individuals who have been slaughtered, they either endure it in silence or are not valued by the Chinese people. However, counting on our fingers, there are countless cases that are obvious to everyone. If we have any spirit, we must think about it calmly and feel angry and indignant. Although the reasons for causing these tragic cases are what? In a word, it is the lack of diplomacy in a weak country. The imperialists use unequal treaties as a talisman and treat the Chinese people as if they are invisible, especially the working-class friends who earn their living by their own labor. They are regarded as sacrifices under the iron hooves. Not only do they treat us as subordinate colonies, but they also treat the people of our dignified Republic of China as inferior to grass and dogs. The old humiliation has not yet been washed away, and new humiliation is being added. The recent case of French sailors killing our compatriot Xin Dingxiang is particularly hateful. This kind of brutal behavior is actually done by people who claim to be civilized countries, which is a blatant exposure of their hideous faces. We should know that the occurrence of the Xin case is not only a personal problem, but a matter of life and death for the entire nation. The more we come into contact with imperialists, the more we are in danger of losing our lives. A rabbit dies, and a fox mourns; things hurt their own kind. How can we stand idly by when it involves the national system? Our associations are deeply indignant about this tragic case for the sake of humanity and the survival of the nation. After a joint meeting, a consensus was reached to fight to awaken the imperialists and to be pioneers in popular diplomacy. The minimum requirements must be achieved: punish the murderers, compensate, apologize, and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again. The police officers who privately released the murderers must be severely punished, and the foreign troops stationed in China must be withdrawn, the unequal treaties must be abolished, and the concessions must be recovered without delay. We will fight to the end and will never give up until we achieve our goals. We dare to lead the fellow villagers in Shanghai to provide strong support for the Xin case, and we hope that the people of the country will rise up to help. The country is fortunate, and the nation is fortunate. This is our declaration.

<p>The Concubine of the Accountant of Yihonglou</p>
<h3 id="e138">Request to Separate Cohabitation Relationship <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Debate Concluded, Awaiting Judgment</p>
<p>Sheng Xiankang from Ningbo, the accountant of Yihonglou Restaurant on Guangxi Road, recently had his concubine, Sheng Lin, hire lawyer Wang Shizong to file a lawsuit in the Special District Court, requesting to separate their cohabitation relationship. Her reasons are roughly as follows: In the 10th year of the Republic of China, she was tricked by the defendant, who said that he had no wife and wanted to marry her. She believed him to be true and cohabited with him. It was not until the following year that she learned that the defendant already had a wife. However, what was done could not be undone. Over the past ten years, she has given birth to two daughters and one son, but only a six-year-old daughter, Meiying, is still alive, and the others have died prematurely. Unexpectedly, since January of last year, all expenses at home have suddenly been cut off, and she has not been paid. Her requests for support have been met with beatings. She has no choice but to file a lawsuit with your court, requesting permission to separate their cohabitation relationship and to order the defendant to pay the living expenses of 50 yuan per month, totaling 900 yuan, from January of last year to June of this year, and 1,000 yuan for the education and other expenses of her young daughter in the future. The previous morning, Judge Yang Yi summoned them and the plaintiff's lawyer, Wang, stated that the defendant had a wife who suffered from neurological symptoms and could not have children, so he married the plaintiff. However, although the plaintiff gave birth to a son, he soon died prematurely. The defendant's wife has now given birth to two daughters and one son, so he has achieved his purpose of having a son and has abandoned the plaintiff. Therefore, he should be allowed to separate. The defendant hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him, saying that the defendant could not agree to the plaintiff's request to separate and requested that they continue to cohabit. The plaintiff previously suffered from an epidemic in the hospital and saw hope that the plaintiff would not be seduced by others, resulting in a muddled heart and wanting to separate from her husband. However, nowadays, there are young idlers who specialize in seducing wealthy women, and when the women's money is exhausted, they are discarded like worn-out shoes, and it is too late to regret it. Therefore, he hopes that the plaintiff will turn back as soon as possible. Sheng Lin denied what lawyer Fan said and insisted on separating. Then, after the debate began, Judge Yang ordered that the debate in this case be concluded and a date be set for judgment.</p>
<p>Husband Has Syphilis, Wife Requests Divorce</p>
<p>Ms. Bi Xin, a woman from Ningbo, recently filed a petition with the Special District Court, requesting a divorce from her husband, Bi Liangen. Her petition states that in the 11th year of the Republic of China, she married the defendant through a matchmaker. The couple's relationship was still harmonious. However, after a few years, the defendant's temperament suddenly changed, and he wandered around all day, neglecting his business. Moreover, he contracted syphilis, which was extremely serious. His lower body had become incomplete. After contracting the disease, the children born to her all died within a few months due to the residual poison. She felt deeply painful and found it difficult to bear the burden of cohabitation. Moreover, the defendant gambled and squandered money without restraint. His parents-in-law could not stop him, and her advice was ineffective. Her clothes and other items were all pawned by the defendant. She worked as a female worker in a cigarette factory and earned about 20 yuan a month, which was also forcibly taken away by the defendant. If she did not give it, she would be beaten. Such abuse is difficult to describe in writing. Now, the situation has become more serious. Her unlined clothes are stolen and pawned for spending money if she is not careful. Every time she asks, she is beaten. The defendant's syphilis has become an undeniable fact. For the sake of her lifelong happiness, she has no possibility of cohabiting with him. Therefore, she has filed this petition for divorce and asks that all her dowry be returned. The day before yesterday, Presiding Judge Ying summoned the plaintiff, who explained the previous situation, and said that the defendant was also addicted to opium. The defendant admitted to smoking opium occasionally but denied being addicted to it. He hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. Judge Ying verified the report and ordered that the debate be concluded and a date be set for judgment.</p>
<p>Widow Died Tragically After Abortion</p>
<h3 id="e139">Placenta Ascended, Could Not Be Saved <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Ni Xia (also known as Tianmei), a young woman from Changzhou living on a boat in Puhuitang Port, Hongqiao Town, west of Shanghai, is 28 years old this year. Her husband, Ni Gengsheng, died of illness in the spring of the 16th year of the Republic of China, leaving behind one son and one daughter. The son, Sanlin, is seven years old, and the daughter, A Duo, is only five years old. Her aunt, Ms. Zhang, and her husband's younger brother, Haisheng, live separately on the boat and do not interact with each other. Tianmei grew up in Hongqiao and usually transported vegetables, soybeans, wheat, and oil cakes for people. The business was quite good. After Ni Gengsheng died, Tianmei's younger brother, Tianfa, took care of the boat. However, Tianmei was unwilling to sleep alone and often had affairs with Wu, Shen, and others. Recently, she had a love affair with Chu Gengsheng, a vegetable vendor from Zhou Shen Lane. They were very close and acted like husband and wife, resulting in a pregnancy. At the end of last month, Gengsheng entrusted Ding Ada to accompany Tianmei to Fahua to have an abortion. Because she was a widow and no one was responsible, they returned to Hongqiao. Later, she entrusted Chen Chen, the wife of Chen Yatou from Shang'ao Pond, to buy medicine. Unexpectedly, after taking the medicine, the fetus was safely delivered. Because it was premature, it died immediately after being born. The placenta suddenly ascended and could not descend. Life was hanging by a thread. Chu Gengsheng was so anxious that he hired Gu Axin and others to hire Gong Jisheng's wife (a midwife) from Gongjia Bang to diagnose and treat her on the boat. According to her, the placenta had ascended and could not be saved. She died at 11 p.m. the night before last. Afterwards, Xia Tianfa reported to the police station in charge, and Patrolman Pan ordered the local guarantor Gu Yuyuan to investigate the truth of the matter based on the fact that the woman's death was strange for verification.</p>
<p>Woman Requests Property Division</p>
<h3 id="e140">Not Yet of Legal Age <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Should Accompany Mother to Court Next Time</p>
<p>Zhu Xiulan, a local woman, lives in the Nantou area of Pudong. Her father, Zhu Ziqing, died in the 17th year of the Republic of China, and her mother is still alive. There are five siblings: the eldest sister is named Zhang Ying, the second brother is Zengxiang, the third brother is Qingxiang, the fourth sister is Cailan, and the fifth is Xiulan. Now, Xiulan has suddenly hired lawyer Wang Youlin to draft a statement to the District Court, suing her brothers Zengxiang and Qingxiang for seizing the property and not dividing it, and requesting a division of the inheritance. Her intention to sue is that her two brothers have married and her two sisters have married, so all of her late father Ziqing's inheritance should be divided into three shares. Yesterday morning, Judge Tong Shenglu opened a court hearing. The defendants Zhu Zengxiang and Zhu Qingxiang did not attend and instead appointed lawyer Qu Jinwei to represent them. The plaintiff Zhu Xiulan came with lawyer Wang and stated that she was a 20-year-old Shanghainese. (Question) When is your birthday? (Answer) The ninth day of the fourth month, at night. I don't know when I was born. (Question) Have you ever been married? (Answer) No. (Question) Is your mother still alive? (Answer) My father has passed away, but my mother, Zhu Yan, is still alive. The official said, "You are not of legal age to sue. Your mother should come out to make a claim. According to the law, you must be 20 years old, but you will not be 20 years old until the ninth day of the fourth month of next year, after your birthday." At this point, the defendant's lawyer stood up and said, "After investigating, this inheritance has already been divided and the relatives were present at the scene. 3 mu, 6 li, and 7 hao of land in the 24th Bao and 15th Tu of Shangyi have been distributed to the plaintiff. This time, the plaintiff's lawsuit has no basis and should be dismissed." The judge then said to the plaintiff, "You should accompany your mother to court next time. It would be best to reconcile out of court to avoid hurting the feelings between siblings." After the order, the court adjourned.</p>

<p>The Guests Were Also Greatly Disappointed</p>
<p>Mo Rongsheng, a native of Shengqiao Township in western Shanghai, is a mechanic at a yarn factory in Yangshupu, Shanghai. The 5th of this month was the date of Mo's wedding, so he distributed invitations and invited relatives and friends to the banquet. More than a dozen people from Shanghai went. At night, after the wedding was completed, the groom and bride were sent to the bridal chamber. Unexpectedly, in the middle of the night, more than a dozen robbers armed with weapons and torches broke down the door and entered. They first went to the bridal chamber to rob. The two newlyweds heard the noise and shouted for help. The robbers beat the groom and opened the box. All the bride's gold jewelry and soft clothing were robbed. Then they went to other rooms to search. A female relative who had gone from Shanghai had her bracelets and more than a hundred yuan robbed. Fortunately, a neighbor heard the noise and sounded the gong for help. The robbers stopped robbing when they heard the noise and fled with the stolen goods. Mo was beaten and injured in the back by the robbers. Yesterday, he asked a doctor to treat him and reported the case to the police in the area, requesting them to arrest the robbers.</p>
<p>Murder Case in Qujiaqiao, Luodian, Baoshan</p>
<h3 id="e142">The Murderer Qian Xingsheng Was Sentenced to Death <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Wife of the Deceased, Zhang Wang, Was Acquitted</p>
<p>Zhou Wang (also known as Zhang Wang, 29 years old), a farmer from Qujiaqiao, Luodian, Baoshan, was a widow. In the spring of this year, she had an affair with Qian Xingsheng (22 years old), a local fisherman. Soon after, Yu Ahua, an ant matchmaker, sold her to the deceased Zhang Shengrong to be his wife. Unexpectedly, on the seventh day after arriving at Zhang's house, Qian Xingsheng, hating Zhang Shengrong for occupying his lover, took a sharp knife on the night of the 16th of last month and climbed down from the roof of Zhang's house. He sneaked into Zhang's bedroom and, taking advantage of Zhang and Wang sleeping soundly, stabbed Zhang in the throat and right under the throat with the sharp knife, penetrating about seven inches. Zhang died instantly. Qian then fled. When Wang woke up, she touched her clothes in the dark and found that they were very wet and smelled of blood. She called out to Zhang, but there was no response. Then, she woke up Zhang Ajin, the uncle who lived with them, and lit a fire to see that Zhang had already died. Then, she informed Zhang's father, Tingjue, of the situation and immediately went to the third sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau to report the incident. After Bureau Chief Gao Xitian repeatedly questioned Wang about the identity of the murderer, she said that she suspected it was her former lover, Qian Xingsheng. After receiving the report, the bureau immediately sent police officers to arrest Qian. Qian Xingsheng refused to be arrested and fled. In the end, he was not caught due to the darkness. The next day, the bureau prepared a document and reported it to the General Bureau, which then reported it to the county government for an autopsy. Subsequently, the Public Security Bureau arrested the murderer Qian Xingsheng and sent him to the county government. County Chief Qiu Mingjiu repeatedly sent the investigating officer Huang Jie to hold a court hearing. Qian Xingsheng confessed to the murder, but said that Wang had asked him to kill Zhang Shengrong in the fields on the afternoon of the 22nd and at Yangmuqiao on the morning of the 23rd so that they could resume their old relationship. Wang坚决否认有教唆及帮杀情事继据尸叔张阿金供称该两日均在家中未曾外出等语末据尸父张亭爵供称其子被杀之后系王氏喊醒张阿金由张阿金之子阿宝通知等语是案发生后宝山各界人士大为注意业经审理终结宣判钱杏生预谋杀人一罪处死刑褫夺公权无期周王氏无罪开释 Wang firmly denied that she had instigated or helped with the murder. Zhang Ajin, the uncle of the deceased, testified that he was at home on both of those days and did not go out. Finally, Zhang Tingjue, the father of the deceased, testified that after his son was killed, Wang woke up Zhang Ajin, and Zhang Ajin's son, Abao, notified him. After the case occurred, all sectors of Baoshan paid great attention to it. After the trial was concluded, Qian Xingsheng was sentenced to death for premeditated murder and deprived of his political rights for life. Zhou Wang was acquitted.</p>

<p>The military band of the Songhu Garrison Command brought up the rear. There were a total of about seventy cars in the funeral procession, with Yunfei Company cars accounting for fifty of them. Each car was decorated with a black ribbon bow, and the uniform color of the cars added to the extremely quiet and solemn atmosphere. Behind the funeral cars was the company's road-clearing vehicle, taking care of the order along the way. Spectators praised the scene incessantly. When the procession passed through Nanjing Road, north-south traffic on Xizang Road, Zhejiang Road, Fujian Road, Henan Road, and other streets was disrupted for about ten minutes before returning to normal. It is said that among Chinese people whose funerals have been able to pass through Nanjing Road, the first was Sheng Xingzun, the second was Zhu Bao San, and now Mr. Wu ranks third.</p>

People immediately transported him to Tongren Hospital and then to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road for an autopsy.</p>

<p>The Zhendan Chicken Ball Brand Powder Fire Extinguisher, invented by Xue Zhenxiang, owner of Zhendan Machinery Factory, was summoned to the capital on the first of this month by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for a demonstration. It received high praise from the representatives of various provinces attending the industrial and commercial conferences. The factory also responded to a request from a major local factory and gave a demonstration yesterday afternoon at 3:00 in the Zhabei Charity Hall. Three fires of varying sizes were started, all extremely fierce. To be on the safe side, the Zhabei Fire Brigade dispatched two vehicles to the scene in advance. However, while the fire was raging fiercely, the Zhendan Powder Fire Extinguisher was deployed, and in less than a minute, the fire was extinguished and the smoke cleared. Guests such as Lu Jinlin, head of general affairs of the Shanghai South District Fire Brigade Association, the Zhabei First and Second District Chiefs, and other important officials, as well as Mr. Wang Bin Yan of the Commercial Press, Mr. Shi of the Kenye Bank, Mr. Wang Dafu, president of the Rice Industry Association, Mr. Fan Hesheng, and others, about six or seven hundred people in total, applauded and praised the extinguisher.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Mr. Hu and the Reading Movement <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Qian</p>
<p>Recently, a novel undertaking has emerged in Shanghai society, namely the youth association's reading movement. Yesterday was the first day of the opening, with Mr. Hu Shih giving a lecture on "Why Read?" I will briefly record Mr. Hu's lecture and some interesting details to share with readers of this column.</p>
<p>Those Who Came Late Rushed In When the author arrived at 3:00 p.m., I saw a large crowd gathered in front of the office counter. I went forward to inquire and learned that all the tickets had been distributed and everyone was demanding accommodation. At that time, there were still two hours before the start of the lecture, and those who came were already expressing regret. This shows the sensational nature of the event and the appeal of Mr. Hu. After I arrived, more people continued to arrive until 4:30, so the staff in the meeting were repeatedly surrounded by latecomers. Finally, they defused the situation with the phrase (wait until those with tickets are seated before opening the doors to accommodate the gentlemen who came late). However, many of those who came late were unwilling to wait for a long time and wanted to force their way in. The gatekeepers also firmly refused to let them in, so the crowd of latecomers temporarily united and agreed to charge. For a while, the sounds of (push!) (charge!) never stopped. In the end, they were victorious and rushed into the meeting. Taking advantage of the force of those pushing in front and behind, the author also took the opportunity to enter. At that time, the laughter of victory replaced the sound of effort. This may be a harbinger of the future courage and progress of the reading community.</p>
<p>Three Points on Reading At 5:00, after the singing of the party song, the ceremony, and the silence, Mr. Hu stood up to give his lecture. He first expressed humility, saying that teaching me how to read or what to read is very easy to talk about, but why read is a bit difficult, and I am afraid I will not speak well. Now I will try it. He then said that he had given a lecture on this question once before, and the manuscript happened to be collected in the third volume of Hu Shih's essays. Gentlemen, you may wish to refer to it. Then he entered the subject and said that there are three points in reading: first, books are a record of knowledge, wisdom, and experience, and the heritage of mankind. Reading is to accept this heritage and use it as a foundation to develop and expand it. The second is to read for the sake of reading, because mankind has a need to read, so we read. The more we read, the more books we can read. The third is to read to solve difficulties. When difficulties are present, we must think, and thinking can generate ideas. With ideas, it is good to choose a suitable doctrine to solve the difficulties. If you do not read, you will not have ideas. The more you read, the more ideas you will naturally have, and it will be easier to solve the difficulties. Mr. Hu cited many examples when he spoke, and he was very eloquent, so it took a long time.</p>
<p>Half a Dozen Goods in a Grocery Store Finally, Mr. Hu said again that he had already stated in advance that speaking may encroach on other scheduled topics. Now I want to contribute a little opinion, that is, how do we read? I have read books for 35 years, but these 35 years of experience tell me that very few of the many books in China are systematic and structured. They are all unplanned, casually compiled successes. The so-called Classics, History, Philosophy, and Collections are obviously grocery stores. However, is Philosophy not also a grocery store? Are History and Classics not also grocery stores? Because it is a grocery store, there are very few that are truly systematic and structured. At most, only half a dozen are up to the previous conditions. Therefore, we only read Chinese books and feel that it is not enough, so we must learn at least one foreign language in order to achieve the effect of extensive reading, extensive collection, and analogy. If scholars can put in a year of hard work, not afraid of trouble, look up unfamiliar words, identify sentences, and understand each word and sentence very clearly, they will have good results. If they continue to work hard, there will be a day when you can read foreign books in bed without effort. That is the joy of reading, and the joy is endless. At this point, Mr. Hu bowed and retired in the midst of applause.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Small Suggestions on the Railroad <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Qing</p>
<p>Modify Cars with Iron Wheels Use Instead of Special Trains</p>
<p>Every time important people go in and out, special trains are opened. Military</p>
<p>It goes without saying during the period. It is probably because of time constraints that it will delay national affairs. We cannot deeply criticize the authorities for their mistakes. However, the cost of trains is huge and the expenses are considerable. In my opinion, cars can be modified with iron wheels and placed on the railroad, still using the car engine to start. It will run fast and save money. If the cost of each special train is 100 yuan, and the cost of using a car is 10 yuan, this can save 10%. Accumulating a little can also be a major economic avenue.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Record of Shen Li's Marriage <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>On November 1st, my cousin Shen Dashi, introduced by Dr. Lu Jinhou and Mr. Liu Shumei, married Ms. Li Guoqi, the granddaughter of Li Hanzhang of Hefei, at the Dahua Hotel. A banquet was held at the Xin Xin Restaurant in the evening, and important people came to watch, which was a great event at the time. I will record the interesting things I saw to share with readers of this column.</p>
<p>Solemn and Brilliant Hall More than twenty pairs of flower baskets filled the hall, with silver screens, silver shields, and other objects in the middle. Behind was the music stage, and in front was the guest seating area. When the wedding ceremony was held, the ceiling lights in the hall were all lit up, as if the sky was full of stars, brilliant and spectacular. The guests sat quietly in it, as if they were in a heavenly palace.</p>
<p>The Groom Forgot the Ring The emcee, Zhou Shang, gave a loud Qin music sound, and the music on the music stage started. The groom entered the seat before the bride. After a short while, the bride entered the hall slowly led by three pairs of bridesmaids. The guests clapped and greeted her. The bride wore a white dress and a veil about two or three feet long. When the emcee sang about exchanging ornaments, the bride took off the ring on her hand and gave it to the groom. The groom also planned to take off the ring in order to exchange it, but he forgot to bring it in a hurry, which caused a temporary laugh.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai's Wonderful Words The marriage witness, Mr. Cai Yuanpei, gave a very mysterious speech, roughly saying that what we people in the world need most now is science and art. Now the groom, Mr. Shen, is studying economics overseas, and the bride, Ms. Li, is studying music at the National Conservatory of Music. Combining science and art in one furnace, the marriage of Shen and Li will definitely form a good family.</p>
<p>A Hall Full of Doctors and Masters The groom, Mr. Shen, once studied at Northwestern University in the United States, so most of the guests who came to watch that day were overseas scholars. There were quite a few doctors and masters. It was a grand and unprecedented occasion. Important figures such as Zhang Fuyun, the director of the Customs Department, and Dr. Zhang Zhongdao, the director of the Nanjing City Education Bureau, also came to watch. The groomsmen were Dr. Ma Zhichao, etc.</p>
<p>Unmarried Couples Accompanying the Hall In the evening, the two families of the man and woman held a banquet at the Xin Xin Restaurant. The seat in the middle was occupied by the groom and bride, and most of those accompanying the new couple were female guests. The unmarried sister-in-law of the bride was also in the seat. When the banquet was half over, the bride's brother was escorted by the guests and also moved to the groom's seat to drink side by side with his fiancée. As a result, a group of relatives and friends toasted the newlyweds on the one hand, and on the other hand, they asked the unmarried couple to raise their glasses and intensify their work. It was also a particularly interesting event.</p>
<p>The Bride's Alcohol Tolerance Is Better Than the Groom's After the new couple finished toasting the guests, Director Zhang Zhongdao and Mr. Ge Gongzhen, recommended by the guests, set the record for toasting the new couple. As a result, a hundred people responded to the call, and male and female relatives and friends came with wine pots and surrounded the new couple. The groom had a very small alcohol tolerance and felt dizzy after drinking only a few glasses. The bride had a very high alcohol tolerance. At first, she drank everything, but later she had to find a way to decline because there were too many people toasting. The banquet ended near midnight.</p>

<p>— Hui Jian</p>
<p>After lunch, I proposed to visit Longjing and buy good tea, so I returned to the boat to Tongji Bridge in Yishanbu. I disembarked and the boatman sought a sedan chair for me, supplemented by a rickshaw. The three of us took turns riding in it and went west along the mountain road. At that time, the scorching sun was shining on our backs and it was very warm. Halfway through, Banxia told me that there were two hungry monks in front of Liu Zhuang's shore, clasping their hands together to ask for money. They were all five or six years old. I remembered Mr. Chen San Yuan's poem: "The setting sun is on the misty shore of the temple, knowing that there are hungry monks who will not return." It was like writing the scene at this time. Everyone sighed. After walking for a few miles, we arrived at Hupao first and then at Dinghui Temple to see its very grand mountain gate. The Jizu Pagoda Courtyard on the right was connected to it like a temple. When we arrived, there was a Westerner and a Chinese sitting in front of the door painting oil paintings with the mountain gate as the background. The green willows shaded the scenery and the interest was great. Entering the temple to Hupao Spring, I saw that the water quality was very light and clear. I tried throwing a copper coin into it, and it turned and fell down like the meaning of Wuxi Spring. After a short visit to the spring, we went out and turned east into a fork in the road. The car could not enter, so Banxia abandoned it. After walking about three or four miles, we arrived at Daren Temple. The abbot of the temple, Tique, was a friend of Banxia. I originally planned to stay overnight at the temple, but he happened to be in the city. A monk guided me and others to visit the so-called Shiwu Cave, which was a cave that could accommodate several square feet of space. It was shaped like a studio. When I entered, I felt a sense of coldness that forced people's hearts to palpitate. Dozens of small Buddhas were engraved on the walls, and the techniques were all worth seeing. After passing Daren Temple, we continued to walk through several villages, where children chased away guests and fat dogs barked at people. Entering the mountains was already very deep. Arriving at Shuile Cave, a monk held a lantern and waited at the entrance of the cave, asking to guide us. The cave was about twenty feet deep, and the height did not touch the head. The monk stopped at a water hole and said that he was afraid of suffocation if he went forward, so he blocked it with rocks. We tried to turn off the lights and indeed felt suffocated and unbearable. Banxia scooped up the water and drank it, saying that it was very sweet. After passing Shuile Cave, we arrived at Yanxia Cave about a mile away. The mountain trees were ferocious here, and all we could see was chaotic clouds. Walking in the mountains was even more difficult. It was already halfway up Nan Gao Peak. I originally planned to visit Lian Temple via the Yangmeiling branch road and visit the Nine Streams and Eighteen Caves. Lao Lan and Banxia both insisted that it was late and they could not do it, so they took another road to Longjing. As soon as we reached the entrance of the village, we saw a tea shop shouting for guests to come in and view it. The best quality tea was called Shifeng Yacha. It was a flag, not a spear. The color was slightly green and the smell was clear and fragrant. The price was one yuan per tael, which was the highest price among Longjing teas. Banxia and I suspected that it was not entirely reliable and abandoned it. When we went out, there was another good tea that could be sold. When we arrived, it was still a tea shop, and the price could not be lowered. Then we were willing to give an extra tael outside of five taels. I and others bought a few taels each as a souvenir of this trip. The shopkeeper quickly led us to visit the well in front of the door, which was Longjing. Most of those who sell tea here have the surname Weng. The mountain is called Wengjiashan, which is three miles away from here and is Xinlongjing. It is said that the tea quality is better than this and the planting is also more effective. Looking at the time, it was already half past five. Banxia and Lao Lan were unwilling to go, so we returned to Tongji Bridge and took the Qianzhou boat back east. It was already dusk. Banxia recited my old poem "The Great Moon Turns Green and Yellow, and All Things Are Like Paintings."</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Fifteen: Tears Fall All Around for Sad Red Romance, Hearts are Captured by Lingering Green Thoughts</p>
<p>Ling Zhixiang is a grand educator in the world of flowers. In Shanghai's prostitute society, there is a saying that he is a "garbage wagon." The meaning of "garbage wagon" is that he accepts everything, good or bad, beautiful or ugly, without discrimination, just like a garbage wagon on the road that takes in all kinds of dirty and filthy things. That is a madam's way of cursing someone, but the person being cursed does not take offense. Long Ziyun is the opposite of Ling Zhixiang. He does not advocate calling in every madam and singer, like Han Xin commanding troops, the more the better. Instead, he advocates continuing to call on a family once he is acquainted with them. Especially, the ones he calls on are established families in the Shanghai prostitution world. Now he is calling on the Bao family in Puqing Lane. The family has a military background and is known as a warlord family. At this time, there are several families in the northern part of Shanghai that can be called prostitution warlords, such as the Bao family. The so-called Bao family's five clouds have generations of successors, and those who come out seem to each have their own style. All kinds of strange and extravagant costumes are not allowed, nor are they allowed to be too simple and frugal, with an intention to suit both the present and the past. That day, they arrived at a Beijing restaurant on Shilu Road called Yuebinlou. This restaurant was newly built, and the old store was reopening. In Shanghai, whenever a new store opens, everyone wants to make a fuss, as it is human nature to like the new and dislike the old. Moreover, everyone wants to try a new restaurant or bar. New things gradually become old, so the old ones are renovated. The new can also cause a stir for a while, like a restoration era in a country. Chinese merchants used to have a kind of conservatism, believing that the older the signboard, the more valuable it was. Even if the pillars were blackened by smoke and the walls were mottled, they would never repair them, as if repairing them would have a great impact on business. Like the restaurants in the alleys of Shanghai and the small restaurants outside Qianmen in Beijing, they were all like that. Although the cooking was very exquisite, the place was really too difficult. Sometimes it was steamed by various oil fumes, and sometimes the tables and chairs were covered with grease. Moreover, the place was small and not enough to turn around. When there were more customers, their backs touched each other and their clothes brushed against each other. But the more crowded it was, the more prosperous the business became. The shop owners had a kind of superstition, believing that such prosperous business must be due to good feng shui. If they repaired and rebuilt, it would hinder the feng shui. But when it was really dilapidated and there was no room to stand, that feng shui superstition would be broken. Because in the Shanghai concessions, houses had a certain number of years before they had to be demolished and rebuilt. After rebuilding, the house would naturally be brand new, and the rent would also be increased. At that time, the land price would also rise. The shop owners who lived in new houses and paid higher rents might have to add some capital to reorganize their business. So they added a lot of new furniture, opened new sources of income, and even installed a neon sign to illuminate the entrance like daylight. Yuebinlou is also an old store reopening this time. Originally, their food was not bad, so it caused a stir again.</p>

<p>The changing power is moderate, and the transaction volume is not large. The gold market situation last week was still considered mild, but there was no lack of circling. Only three or four taels were reviewed every day. It coincided with the Western merchants' autumn competition period. From Monday to Wednesday, it was customary for the market to be open for half a day, and colleagues had no large amount of receipts and payments. In fact, the swap period was approaching, and the confrontation between the long and short sides had become a stalemate. Since Tuesday (November 4), the prices of British and American silver have both been reported to be long, and the London shilling has risen sharply by 3.125. The shilling was then quoted half a gear higher. As a result, the gold price had broken through the 80 taels mark, and suddenly it was 74 taels and 9 mace. At that time, large households such as Zhifeng, Yongnei, Xingyuan, Yongyongchengchang, etc. tended to sell off. However, by Thursday, the silver market saw a contraction and the exchange rate contracted by half a gear. Large groups and arbitrageurs in the market scrambled to buy, and the price trended upwards, reaching 85 taels and 8 mace. After that, there was a slight accumulation, but the intentions of the industry were confused and at a loss, as if there was news. The price suddenly showed an unnecessary change. It was found that the total for this week was 10 taels and 0.9 mace. If the result was delayed until Saturday, it was 82 taels and 8 mace, a drop of only 3 mace compared to the previous Saturday. As for the overseas silver market, large bars were long by 1.875 to 1.25, and the price of American silver was long by 2.5. HSBC's listing of shillings had no changes, only long and then short, and the transaction price of the bank was also peaceful. Arbitrageurs in the gold industry sometimes engaged in padding, but the amount was not large. The closing price was initially pressed within 40 taels, then 34-5 taels, and finally 37 taels. The spot red bar trend was not smooth, and the price seemed to be downstream. The term bid only added 12 taels to 11 taels. The general situation of the week is described below:</p>
<p>The swap message is approaching, and the long and short sides are watching. Since Monday, the large bar of silver has not moved, but American silver has been long by 2.5, and the shilling has not moved. The domestic market has also not changed. Guangbang has slightly padded. As for the gold bid, the initial opening for December was 81 taels and 3 mace. Because of the activity of buyers, it was calculated at 82 taels, so the shilling seemed loose and the sellers exceeded the constant, and the price dropped by more than 3 taels, breaking the 80 taels mark. The closing price at noon was 79 taels and a half. In the afternoon, due to the autumn competition holiday, the next day, the buying exceeded the selling and the exchange market loosened. The large bar was long again. At the beginning of the morning, it was tired, but then suddenly it was 74 taels and 9 mace, but it immediately returned to 1-2 taels, and finally it was flat, calculated at 77 taels. It fell for three consecutive days, a total of 7 taels and 2 mace. The gold market on Wednesday had a rebounding trend and once escaped the 80 taels mark, but the large bar continued to be long and the silver price was not good. The market was still flat in the early morning, but later, because the buyers were strong and the bars were particularly lacking, there was a rush of more than 4 taels. The closing price at noon reached 82 taels and 3 mace. From morning to noon, there was a review of 5 taels and 1 mace, an increase of 5 taels and 3 mace compared to the previous day. The next day, the large bar and the silver price both contracted, and the shilling also contracted by half a gear. The gold market has resumed full-day business because the autumn competition has passed. The initial opening rose by 1 tael and 9 mace. Later, Yuanheng, Shunli, Taikang, Run, etc. scrambled to buy, and it was discovered that it had reached 85 taels and 8 mace. However, after noon, it retreated by 2-3 taels, and Zhifeng, Yongyongfeng, etc. sold off. The afternoon was flat, only with an increase of 2 taels. The final calculation was 83 taels and 1 mace, a continued increase of 8 mace. But the market situation was mild, and the difference for the whole day was only 3 taels. On Friday, the large bar returned long and the silver price did not move. The gold market situation was very flat, only with a circling of 2 taels, and the price stood between 83 and 4 taels. There were few transactions, but the closing price was 84 taels, an increase for three consecutive days compared to the previous day. The increase on this day was only 9 mace. On Saturday, the silver market and the exchange ticket department did not change. The gold market seemed to be latent. It had already risen repeatedly and then reversed. The initial price was around 84 taels. By noon, Taiheng, Yuan, Yuanmao, Yongzhifengyong, etc. had suddenly sold off. People's hearts were easily empty, and the market atmosphere was weakened as a result. The result was 82 taels and 8 mace, a drop of 1 tael and 2 mace and a half. The rise and fall during the day were only 2-3 mace. After the closing price, it was heavily suppressed to around 2 taels. The high and low prices of British, American, and Indian silver markets, exchange tickets, and gold are listed below:</p>

<p>Securities Market: Bond Market Turned Bullish Sharply Last Week</p>
<h3 id="e163">Turnover Exceeded 63.8 Million <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>19 Customs and 96 Increased Significantly, the Rest were also Firm</p>
<p>During the past week, the public bond market in this port's securities market had futures transactions that far exceeded those of the previous week, and trading was very active. Except for Tuesday and Wednesday, which were slightly calm, with only more than 7 million yuan each day, Friday and Sunday were the most lively, with turnover of about 15.4 million yuan. The first day of the week also had more than 12 million yuan, and each day was above 10 million yuan. The total reached 63,870,000 yuan, exceeding the previous week by 30 million yuan. Among them, the 19 Customs and 96 were extremely prosperous. The 19 Customs tax was calculated at 12,685,000 yuan for the November period and 13,365,000 yuan for the December period. The 96 public bond was 3,880,000 yuan for the November period and 7,040,000 yuan for the December period. Demobilization and Reorganization were also very smooth, with demobilization at 5,625,000 yuan for the November period and 5,610,000 yuan for the December period. Reorganization was 4,840,000 yuan for the November period and 3,385,000 yuan for the December period. However, the others were quite calm, such as the Customs tax, which was 2,675,000 yuan for the November period and 1,365,000 yuan for the December period. The 19 Cigarette was 935,000 yuan for the November period and 400,500 yuan for the December period. The whole 6-fen was 865,000 yuan for the November period and 285,000 yuan for the December period. Rehabilitation was calculated at 410,000 yuan for the November period and 300,000 yuan for the December period. Finance was only 185,000 yuan and 7 years was 15,000 yuan. Continued 2/5 and continued cigarettes still had no transactions. The spot market was as sparse as before. The total for the week was 92,500 yuan, including 30,000 yuan for the 19 Customs tax, 25,000 yuan for Demobilization, about 20,000 yuan for the 19 Cigarette, and 10,000 yuan for the whole 6-fen. The others were only several thousand yuan. As for the changes in bond prices, the situation was stable and the general meeting of commerce and industry opened. It was generally believed that the national economy could gradually get on track from now on, so the bond market environment was good, people's hearts were optimistic, and investment purchases and trading activities were active. Bond prices all trended upward, with the 96 and 19 Customs having the greatest changes. The 96 had previously been rumored to be reorganized and jumped to 16 or 17 yuan, but later it returned to calm. During the past week, because the reorganization of the 96 could be expected to become a reality, people's hearts were excited and they rushed to buy, and the price rose sharply. The biggest increases were on Thursday and Friday, with Thursday rising about 2 yuan. On Friday, the near-term rose sharply and stopped bidding, and the remote term reached a maximum of almost 25 yuan. However, because the price rose too much and the news of reorganization was expected, but the method had not yet been heard, people's hearts turned empty, and the weekend fell back by 1 yuan and 67 jiao. The 19 Customs had the biggest increase on Monday, rising by 2 yuan and several jiao, and on Tuesday, rising by 1 yuan and 4 jiao. The rest were peaceful, and the 96 rose by 5 yuan, the 19 Customs rose by 4 yuan, and the Demobilization and Reorganization each rose by 1 yuan and 3 or 4 jiao compared to the previous week. The other ups and downs were peaceful. A statistic of the high and low rises and falls of each bond price during the past week is listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Slack Last Week</p>
<h3 id="e164">Spot Demand Stagnant... Bottom Goods Increased... Speculation Rampant <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market situation was very weak last week, and the bearish sentiment became increasingly intense. Because the spot yarn sales were weak, all the gangs were lifeless, resulting in an increase in bottom goods. The sales of 20-count Fu Shepherd's stagnant goods became more and more sluggish, so the Chao gang's idea of ​​selling short was very deep, and there was no intention to cover shorts. There was a sharp drop in the middle, but a certain manufacturer purchased 145 taels to maintain the limit for this month, so people's hearts were slightly shaken and rose back by 1-2 taels. In short, the demand for spot yarn from all parties was not smooth, and the freezing period was approaching in a blink of an eye. The peak sales season was gradually delayed from this, so most people were bearish. The standard yarn price was down 1-2 taels from last week.</p>
<p>Cotton Market Trended Weak Last Week</p>
<h3 id="e165">Hankou Standard Fell 3-4 Mace... Spot Cotton Consumption Weak <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market was still good at the beginning of last week, but before long, the sentiment softened due to the decline in American cotton. Japanese merchants sold to close out, and the price fell again. However, buyers believed that the source of Hankou road was not smooth, and the purchase price from the local heads was high, and the rural farmers were stubborn, so the number of shipments was not prosperous and the arrival was very thin. Therefore, some people's minds of watching the high have always been unresolved. Later, because American cotton fell again by 1 jiao and 1 fen, retail households within the customs closed out, and the price fell by 3-5 mace. The low peak saw 31 taels and 5 mace. On Thursday and Friday, the Shenxin and Huesheng factories purchased large quantities of Indian cotton at cheap prices, and foreign cotton took the opportunity to infiltrate the market. Most people were bearish, but at present, because the arrival of goods from various villages is declining, there is a saying that the market will be squeezed in recent months, and the situation is very firm. However, various factories in China and foreign countries have purchased a lot of foreign cotton. If the arrival of goods is crowded at the time of arrival, there will be great changes. The demand for spot cotton in various factories in a week is very small. The standard flower price is down 3-4 mace from last week, but it is estimated that American cotton has been reduced by more than 30,000 bales, and the price will rise by 2-3 mace tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e166">American, British, and Indian Cotton All Rose Back <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially tired due to bad news from Liverpool, and then it was firm because the government report was beneficial to buyers, and finally it was soft again because some bulls closed out. The futures price rose by 13 to 22 pounds, and the spot price rose by 20 pounds. British cotton futures rose by 10 to 11 points, and the spot price rose by 1 point. Egyptian cotton spot price did not move. Indian cotton initially rose with American cotton, but later it fell back due to selling by local shorts. The average price of Pingguoer and Aomula did not move, and Bairoxi rose by 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 8th):</p>

<h3 id="e168">Grain: Rice Market Suddenly Plunged <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday's domestic telegram arrived, the market turned bullish, because after the rice price in this port soared, the cargo owners on the inside roads all embraced the principle of quick sales, so the arrival of more than 50 ships was also achieved, and the sales of all stalls were uniformly stagnant. Workshops and hoisting workshops all tended to wait and see, so the new japonica rice plunged by as much as 6-7 jiao. The high-priced goods in the market opened at about 15.5 yuan. The speed of the return wind was expected. The yangxian rice also fell by 7-8 jiao, and the special top was only between 12.8-9 yuan, a small sum of more than one yuan in two days. The dujian rice was the same, and the large short rice was violently dumped by 6-7 jiao, and the high price opened at 13.2-3 yuan. The kejian and the port apex only returned 2-4 jiao, because of the retail activity. The zheng and yang rice were both scarce in kejian's stomach all day long, and the source was also successively caused to present a sharp downward trend. Baiyuan rice also plunged, and the special top opened at 16 yuan, and the market high was only 15.7-8 yuan, a small sum of more than half a yuan.</p>
<p>The river in the southern part of Shanghai arrived slightly yesterday, and the changbang new japonica rice initially felt stable, and then turned soft. The large high-priced goods still opened at 15.3 yuan, and the special top market was extremely deserted, so the transaction was flat. The sutong baijing rice who needed top rice opened at 14.6-7 yuan, and the general trend was also weakening due to the sluggishness in Zhabei. The Nanbang's various lian rice, white rice, and late rice all stood firm first and then leveled off. The buying was stagnant, and the price had an increase and decrease of 2 jiao. The yangxian rice was stagnant and the transaction was very weak. The market was sluggish in the afternoon, two or three jiao. The dujian rice initially reacted and shouted tightly, and then the downstream opened at about 13 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Oil Market: Macheng Oil Suddenly Rose Sharply Yesterday <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tung oil market suddenly rose sharply. In the early morning, a telegram from the Han market increased by 6 mace. In the afternoon, a telegram was sent again to increase by 6 mace. The Macheng oil was sold to 17 taels and 6 mace. It was found that the current inventory of Jinjing has been sold out in full. The Macheng oil in the Han market only has 5-600 pieces. The oil stored in this market is even more scarce. At this time, the new goods have not yet entered the market, and the old goods have been cut off, presenting a situation where the new and old are not connected. It is predicted that the oil price will still tend to rise in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Ashen Tung Oil Price Varies <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The rise and fall depend on the quality of the goods.</p>
<p>The white tung oil market has already shown a large drop and a small rebound. Although the price of full-degree oil is 27 yuan and 7 jiao according to the production market, the Shenxing wholesale market not only does not follow the increase, but also reduces it slightly. Yesterday, the colleagues reported that it was still around 27 yuan. The price of ashen tung oil has never had a standard. At this time when the market is turbulent, the asking price is even more uneven. The high transaction price will depend on the quality of the goods.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Seafood: New Scallops Arrived with Prosperous and Cheap Prices <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The source of new goods of thousand scallops has gradually become prosperous recently, and the production price is also reported to be low. Moreover, the demand from the kèbāng [客幫, lit. guest gangs, referring to non-Shanghainese merchants] has not moved much, resulting in a gradual increase in the inventory in Shanghai. The market price of the firms has loosened all at once. Yesterday, the hángpán [行盤, lit. market price, a specific price offered by trading firms] was touting medium-sized new guāng [光, lit. bright; top-quality] goods for 160 taels, old color for 157-8 taels, large-sized for 155 taels, triangular for 142 taels, and broken grains for 136 taels. The Qing Mori goods were 130 taels, the small-sized grains were 115 taels, the domestic Yantai goods were 128 taels, and the wilted ones were 112 taels, but there were few inquiries.</p>

<p>Recently, there are very few 200-pound Huisi iron goods on the market, and there are many purchases from various gangs. As a result, the market goods are generally in short supply, and the standard price has risen sharply. Judging from the trend, there is a great potential for soaring. The price is currently sold at 22 taels and 7 mace and a half, which is another increase of 2 mace and a half compared to before. It is heard that the overseas price is also rising at the moment. As a result, the holders of goods in this port have even firmer thoughts, and the market situation is even more prosperous.</p>

<p>Because the raw materials of Mapai and Elephant Cement have been expensive recently, various companies have news of price increases. However, the date of implementation is still under discussion, so the transactions of construction gangs have been very active recently.</p>

<h3 id="e206">About Sinclair Lewis <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Dai</p>
<p>The winner of the 1930 Nobel Prize in Literature was announced on November 5th. It is Sinclair Lewis, an American novelist.</p>
<p>In the days leading up to this announcement, before the news was released, the most promising candidate for this year's Nobel Prize in Literature, according to newspaper reports, was the American Theodore Dreiser and the newly added member of the French Academy, the poetic philosopher Paul Valéry. However, the announced news differs greatly from the oversensitive reports of newspaper reporters. Let me briefly introduce Sinclair Lewis, the recent recipient of the highest honor in world literature.</p>
<p>The Nobel Prize in Literature began in 1900, and this year marks the thirtieth time it has been awarded. In the past thirty times, those who have received this high honor include five Germans, five French, two English, three Norwegians, two Swedes, and one each from Denmark, Italy, Spain, Poland, Ireland, Switzerland, Belgium, and India.</p>
<p>From the nationalities of the past thirty winners, we see that only one belongs to a so-called oppressed ethnic group, a person of color, namely the Indian Tagore. In this tabulation, we do not see the selection of a literary figure of American nationality, which holds hegemony in the world's economy and politics. We might attribute this fact to Europe's longstanding disdain for the United States, or we can place its explanation on the other hand, in the Americans' focus on material or mechanical enjoyment and neglect of literary and artistic cultivation. But these explanations are not to the point.</p>
<p>In fact, in terms of literature and art themselves, their development and prosperity must accompany economic development and prosperity. This is very evident in literary history. For example, the Elizabethan era was the golden age of English literature, and its prosperity was precisely because the operation of new colonies everywhere increased its wealth and led to economic prosperity. The relationships between Boccaccio of Italy, Cervantes of Spain, and others can be determined by the economic circumstances of their time. The most characteristic point is that the economic form of the early era can determine the content and characteristics of the literature of a certain era. For example, Boccaccio's "Decameron" could only exist in the era of commercialism, and would never have occurred in the feudal era of theocracy before the development of commercialism.</p>
<p>Today, the hegemony of the world economy has shifted from England, based on the textile industry, to the United States, based on the steel industry. Therefore, in politics, England's traditional maritime power policy, no matter how vast its colonies or territories, has to advocate equality of Anglo-American power due to changes in economic circumstances. Of course, the development of art and literature is bound to accompany this unfolding economic situation.</p>
<p>Regarding this historical demarcation, we can divide it with the election of Roosevelt as President. Since Roosevelt, the economic and political power of the United States has become increasingly prosperous. At the same time, the United States has also made new contributions in art and literature. However, this kind of political, economic, and cultural strength gradually attracted the world's attention after Versailles, and finally, this high literary prize was awarded to the American novelist Sinclair Lewis, the first American literary figure to receive this Nobel Prize in Literature.</p>
<p>The Swedish Academy's awarding of the Nobel Prize in Literature to an American literary figure who has been looked down upon, at least (or perhaps oversensitively) has the following significance:</p>
<p>(1) As the political and economic hegemony of the United States rises daily, and for considerations of diplomacy or international relations, it is timely to award this prestigious literary prize to an American literary figure. Behind this, the awarding of this literary prize contains a certain political meaning (in fact, the reason why last year's literary prize was given to Thomas Mann, a German literary figure, can also be said to contain a certain political meaning). (2) The form, style, and content of American literature, which has accompanied the development of the American economy, have been generally noticed and recognized, and the status of the United States in world literature must be acknowledged.</p>
<p>Now let me briefly introduce Lewis's life. Sinclair Lewis was born in 1885 in a small town in Minnesota. From an early age, he was immersed in the environment of the petty bourgeoisie of small towns in the American West. Minnesota is in the northwestern United States, located in the upper reaches of the Mississippi River. The climate is cold early, and it is also a very large plain, so his cold writing style may have been cultivated in this environment. Later, he entered Yale University in the East and obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1907. After graduating from university, he worked as a reporter for a newspaper in New Haven, where the university was located, and also worked as a reporter for the "Bulletin" newspaper and the Associated Press in San Francisco. Later, he was the editor of magazines such as "Transatlantic Tales" and "Volta Review". Later, he was an editor at the publishing house George H. Doran Co.</p>
<p>His first novel was published in 1914 ("Our Mr. Wrenn"), but the key to his fame was "Main Street".</p>
<p>After the publication of "Main Street", he published "Babbitt" in 1922. Later, "Elmer Gantry" in 1927 received even more general attention. In the book, he more forcefully criticized the hypocrisy of American clergymen. In addition, other works include "Arrowsmith", "The Man Who Knew Coolidge", "Mantrap", "Dodsworth", etc. He also wrote plays. His Hobohenia was performed in New York in 1919.</p>
<p>In Lewis's novels, we can see that his writing style is euphemistic and powerful, cold and clever. In American literature, he has indeed pioneered a new style, which can shine brightly with Edgar Allan Poe and Walt Whitman, one after the other. His novels are of course very popular.</p>

<h3 id="e208">In Xuzhou <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Moye</p>
<p>Tongshan Correspondence</p>
<p>Xuzhou is an important strategic point for the rear defense of the Central Army, located at the intersection of the Jinpu and Longhai Railways. Its military significance is self-evident. However, when the troops under Yan and Feng were fighting, although they took this as their destination, they were not actually subjected to military panic. However, most of the wounded soldiers transported back from the front line were left here, so the market could not avoid being disturbed. Now that most of the wounded soldiers have returned to their teams, and the Xuzhou Headquarters has also been withdrawn last week, the various military facilities have disappeared. After arriving in Xuzhou, the reporter's first goal was to investigate the number of wounded soldiers and those who returned to their teams after recovery, in order to observe the content and strength of the army. The second was to investigate the wartime layout and deployment. Now, the findings of the investigation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>1. Brief Statistics on Wounded Soldiers and Returns to Duty: The total number of wounded soldiers in the Central Army exists in the Health Department of the General Headquarters. The exact number is still unavailable. According to a more reliable investigation, it should be over 50,000. The total number of returns to duty is also difficult to know in detail. However, taking Xuzhou as an example, in the past four months, the number of officers and soldiers who recovered from their injuries and returned to their units was only 11,871. The total number of wounded soldiers accommodated in Xuzhou in the seven hospitals before and after was more than 30,000.</p>
<p>The distribution of wounded soldiers returning to duty in Xuzhou in the past four months is approximately as follows: From June 9th to July 27th, a total of 3,046 officers and soldiers. From July 27th to August 31st, a total of 1,925 officers and soldiers. From September 1st to October 1st, a total of 550 officers and soldiers. From October 1st to October 20th, a total of 1,350 officers and soldiers. The above numbers are the survey data of the Xuzhou Wounded Soldier Inspection Office and are very accurate. Furthermore, observing the eighth month after the establishment of the office on June 9th, the investigation of wounded soldiers leaving the hospital is approximately as follows: 6,409 admitted, 5,651 discharged, 2,309 returned to duty, 2,015 transferred, 168 deaths, 1 dismissed, and 164 deserted. Furthermore, observing the number of officers and soldiers returning to duty in each unit based on the army as a standard, from June 9th to July 7th, the number of officers who returned to duty due to injury was: 59 from the 1st Division, 26 from the 2nd Division, 24 from the 3rd Division, 21 from the 11th Division, 26 from the 64th Division, and the remaining units with less than 20 people were not listed. As for soldiers, 705 from the 1st Division, 485 from the 2nd Division, 395 from the 3rd Division, 115 from the 9th Division, 409 from the 11th Division, and 217 from the 64th Division. Those with less than 200 people were generally omitted. In total, there were 200 officers and 2,846 soldiers. The above is for the month of July. Furthermore, in August, the number of officers who returned to duty due to injury was 70 from the 1st Division, 19 from the 2nd Division, and 20 from the 3rd Division, totaling 170. The number of soldiers was 657 from the 1st Division, 133 from the 2nd Division, 158 from the 3rd Division, 157 from the 11th Division, and 173 from the 9th Division, totaling 1,759. The numbers of officers and soldiers from each unit that were less than 20 and 200 respectively were omitted. Note that the above numbers only refer to the Xuzhou area and cannot be generalized to the entire matter. However, Xuzhou is the center of the rear hospitals, and the number of people is also the largest. Officers and soldiers on the Jinpu and Longhai lines are all present, so it is still a material for inference and reference. Readers should know that the units of the Central Army that participated in the war are as follows: three teaching divisions (1st, 2nd, and 3rd divisions), and the National Revolutionary Army's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 46th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 21st, 23rd, 26th, 41st, 42nd, 45th, 47th, 52nd, 54th, 55th, 60th, 63rd, 64th, 65th, and 66th divisions, totaling twenty-one direct armies. In addition, there were also teaching regiments, guard brigades, the 2nd Army Corps, the 1st Route Cavalry Brigade, independent brigades, the 15th Independent Brigade, the Shandong Garrison, the Joint Army Convoy, the 15th Route Headquarters, the 12th Route Headquarters, the 11th Route Headquarters, the 6th Independent Brigade, the Independent Artillery Regiment, the Cavalry Brigade, and the Central Military Academy Headquarters, etc., which were added to the front line one after another. According to the previous table, it can be known that the divisions with the largest number of wounded soldiers and officers are the 1st Division of Liu Zhi, the 2nd Division of Gu Zhutong, the 3rd Division of Chen Jicheng, and the 11th Division of Chen Cheng. Among them, the losses suffered by the units of Liu Zhi, Chen Cheng, and Chen Jicheng were the largest. The larger number of officers and soldiers returning to duty can prove their bravery in combat and strict discipline.</p>
<p>2. Wartime Deployment: Xuzhou is the throat of Nanjing, and the Central Army is bound to defend it to the death. However, because it is far from the front line, the deployment is not urgent. There was a period when the Jin Army bypassed Gunzhou and intended to spy on Tongshan. The Central Government moved the trenches in the Haozhou area, extending them to the north of Tongshan and the shores of Weihu Lake for a total of four to five hundred li. Even within the territory of Tongshan County, the digging and excavation circled for more than a hundred li. Tens of thousands of soldiers were stationed to the west of the station. The reporter once visited and saw that it was about eight feet deep and wide, which was far superior to the five ditches in the Guide area. In addition, the wartime equipment that is commendable is the airfield, which is also located to the west of the station and is the base camp of the Longhai Air Force team. On the first day the reporter came to Xuzhou, he saw red-tailed, blue-winged planes soaring above, transmitting orders to various departments, and they no longer frightened the residents.</p>
<p>Since He Yaozu returned to Beijing and the Xuzhou Headquarters was abolished, Xuzhou seems to have returned to a state of peace. However, in reality, the inns are still occupied by the army, and the cost of living is extremely high. The room rate in ordinary hotels is more than two yuan, which is not comparable to the eight-corner rooms in Pingpu. The prices of all daily necessities and rickshaws are also high. The reason is that on the one hand, the transient officers in the army raised prices, and on the other hand, the sellers, due to the impact of the war, were eager to make up for the losses after the restoration of order. Recently, because the garrison commander Song Runtian followed Chen Tiaoyuan's team to take up a new post in Anhui, the business community was busy preparing a farewell party. At the same time, the 52nd Division of Ye Kaixin, which took over the defense of Xuzhou, has arrived, and its deputy commander Han Deqin came first.</p>

<p>Book Review</p>
<h3 id="e209">Grassland Weekly <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Nan Xin</p>
<p>Volume 3, Issues 12 &amp; 13</p>
<p>The content of (Grassland Weekly) has been particularly brilliant and substantial in the most recently published two issues. Originally, it actively strived to promote nationalist literature and poetry. Among the small weekly publications, we must first recommend (Grassland), which already has a long history. The poems published by Tang Zeng on Issue 12, though starting from a slightly lower point, undoubtedly firmly grasp the core of nationalism in their ideology. The observation expressed in the artistic presentation of the poems as a whole is exceptionally compact. This is what is meant by poetic skill. Now, let's dissect the content of these two poems meticulously, thereby glimpsing the powerful guidance possessed by the poet.</p>
<p>The first poem is titled (Come, Revolutionary Brothers). Just seeing this title makes us readers feel a surge of heroic and passionate spirit, as if we are about to gather with brothers who are fighting for the revolution and rush forward. This is, of course, a revolutionary battle arising for the freedom of our entire Chinese nation.</p>
<p>The entire poem is divided into eleven sections. The author uses poetry to promote nationalist literature as the main theme. Using synthesis, many worthy expressions of scattered and unrestrained forms are appended with elements of beauty, forming a compact and coherent poem. Each section mostly encourages (Revolutionary Brothers) to strive greatly for the glory of the Chinese nation. This, of course, should be advanced unyieldingly. Simply put, the entire poem centers on (encouraging revolutionaries). Secondly, relying on the author's intense emotions and rich imagination, it depicts many remnants that should be washed away and hinder the development of the nation's future. Without hesitation, the gray, decadent clothes must be taken off, and the listless sorrow must be eliminated. In particular, one must have a heart of upward striving courage. At the same time, how to break through the barriers of the enemy and how to build our own defense fortifications for the war for the country. This powerful narrative method supplements the shortcomings of the expressed central idea. To summarize this poem, it undoubtedly possesses several necessary conditions for nationalist poetics. Now, let's quote the first two sections to make the reader understand the poem's heroic and impassioned nature.</p>
<p>Come, Revolutionary Brothers</p>
<p>Come, Revolutionary Brothers</p>
<p>Drink a glass of fine grape wine to the fullest</p>
<p>Chew a piece of bright red meat with heroic abandon</p>
<p>This contains the blood of martyrs</p>
<p>This shines with the iron of the nation</p>
<p>Drink, rush to the forefront of fighting for the country's glory</p>
<p>Drink, rush to the forefront of fighting for the country's glory</p>
<p>Come, Revolutionary Brothers</p>
<p>Come, Revolutionary Brothers</p>
<p>Lie drunk on the battlefield, admiring the beautiful moon in the blue sky</p>
<p>Walk barefoot by the sea, anticipating the night scene amidst the sounds of war</p>
<p>This leaps with the light of hope</p>
<p>This reveals intense passion</p>
<p>Look, reflecting the tragic image of national victory</p>
<p>Look, reflecting the tragic image of national victory</p>
<p>In terms of form, this poem has broken the old conventions and created a new style. The second poem is (The Brilliant Light of Iron and Blood Intertwines). This title contains an unparalleled deep meaning. The entire poem completely depicts the leaping of (iron and blood) on the battlefield, the spirit and feats of martyrs, the ferocious faces of imperialists, etc., all powerfully portrayed. The entire poem is even more intense than the previous one, and the style has also been changed. It has indeed opened a new path in Chinese poetry. For example:</p>
<p>Quickly spur your horse and whip it forward</p>
<p>Relying on iron hooves</p>
<p>Trample through the waning moon for thousands of miles</p>
<p>Relying on a steel-forged head</p>
<p>Break through the stone walls of ten thousand mountains</p>
<p>Sing a thread of golden melody</p>
<p>Run forward</p>
<p>Drink the blood of the barbarian with pain</p>
<p>Run forward</p>
<p>Execute the tyrant</p>
<p>It is truly not easy to express such power in very short lines. The following sections are all lively and delightful. Due to the limited space of this publication, they will not be cited one by one. However, in the present time of striving to promote nationalist literature and art, poems describing the various situations on the battlefield like this</p>
<p>are very urgently needed, and we hope to see them often on (Grassland) with those who love poetry.</p>
<p>The thirteenth issue contains Huang Yuruo's creation (Comrades on the Same Road), which depicts the (May Thirtieth) massacre incident, completely centered on nationalism. For such a major historical fact of the Chinese nation's battle with imperialism, we need to re-evaluate it. This can awaken our compatriots and prevent foreigners from mocking us Chinese for only having five minutes of passion. We have read many of Huang's works on (Grassland), and this one is particularly powerful because the author is exceptionally skilled in technique.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Prenuptial Notes <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Nan Xin</p>
<p>Published by the Grassland Society</p>
<p>The recent Chinese creative world seems to have gradually flourished and then declined. This is because various new bookstores nowadays mostly pay attention to textbooks for various subjects in universities and middle schools, as well as general children's literature. Therefore, short and long creative works are rarely seen by our readers. However, Jin Kuansheng's (Prenuptial Notes) suddenly appeared before our eyes in such a seemingly quiet Chinese creative world. This is truly a very gratifying thing, especially for those of us who love to read literary works.</p>
<p>Jin's book is a kind of diary-style writing, and the language is extremely natural and fluent. When we read each paragraph separately, they are many essays with lasting meaning. If we read them continuously in one breath, then it becomes a diary-style novella. In fact, describing in this way, whether in writing style or meaning, easily reveals the author's unique strengths. In the subtle parts of this (Prenuptial Notes), it can be seen that the author is truthfully depicting it, with no traces of empty embellishment revealed in the words and lines.</p>
<p>The author wrote down a memorable page of his own love history without any concealment. The reason why the author got engaged was really to cherish Ms. Jiang's life experience and comfort his parents' old age. Now let's first look at what he recorded below:</p>
<p>I am not young anymore. I have not relieved my parents of any of their burdens. The eldest son is twenty-four years old (lunar calendar) and has not yet been engaged. Parents very much hope that their son will marry and become an adult. My youth has passed, and the fire of my passionate youth has almost been extinguished. My time can no longer love young girls. Young girls are materials that increase sorrow and trouble for me. Young girls can mislead my great future. My time should be spent studying hard and cultivating myself in order to prepare to contribute to mankind, seek happiness for society, and add glory to the country... I have had several young girls. Have the experiences with several young girls been from beginning to end? Several young girls have wasted excessive amounts of money in vain... Sweet memories add another layer of bitterness to the bitterness. When I examine myself in the middle of the night, I am both ashamed and regretful. I agreed to my parents' engagement, and I will have a proper place to return.</p>
<p>After reading the above section, we can know that the author himself is repenting of his past loves, and at the same time, he is also hoping that his future will be glorious. Therefore, his engagement with Ms. Jiang is seeking a proper destination. These are all words of true feelings. Below is a description of the life experience of his fiancée:</p>
<p>Her situation is bitter. When she was eleven years old, her loving mother passed away. Until she was nineteen years old, she lived a school life. Fortunately, her father loved her so that she did not suffer too much... She was restricted by her family and treated coldly by her stepmother. She had no sisters or brothers to talk and laugh with, and she had no aunts to confide in. From the year she was nineteen, she worked as a teacher. A young girl who had not experienced the world was lonely and bitter, talking to herself. Who was her comfort? The teacher's life was suitable and devoted to her. She found a glimmer of light in the lonely, melancholy, and desperate situation.</p>
<p>From these two sections, we can also glimpse the author's sympathy for his fiancée's desolate life experience. The author nakedly presents these moving scenes before our eyes.</p>
<p>This book is beautifully printed and can truly be used as a prenuptial memento. There are also many new descriptions in the content.</p>
