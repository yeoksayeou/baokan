<p>日本今日選舉已竣。爲各政黨競選閉幕之日。日人之關心於政局者必曰民政黨。勝乎。政友。會勝乎。吾則謂投票之勝負不必問。祇問其競選。之手段。民政黨優乎政友會優乎。蓋政黨最後之勝負不在選舉當選之多寡。而在選手段之優劣。苟其。手段卑劣、一時投票。雖獲多數之勝利。而將來於政治上必歸失敗也。記者對於日本兩黨競選之手段。曾揭其兩劣點。一爲以暴力妨害他派之選舉。一爲公開演說。祇揭人短而揚已長。然此。兩點猶非選舉最大罪惡也選舉最大之罪。惡。在以金錢買收日政黨中非不注意及此對於資財豐富選舉費優厚之黨。亦嘗加以。嚴重監視。	然此種非法行動豈有公然爲之而授人以柄者。雖監視又將何用。不觀其上次之選舉乎。在選舉當時。何嘗發現一賄選案。迨至田。中内閣將倒所謂。疑獄。所謂賄案。始陸續發覺究期用途多關於買收議員。非買收不易揭發之明證。乎。田中挾政友會多數黨之勢力操縱政局。至造成貪汚黑暗之局面而倒。又非買收手段必歸失敗。政治競爭。不在多數之明證乎。　　此次競選兩黨首領濱口犬養奔走演說。日無暇晷。至於形疲口唖。不及趕回投票。自身反失投票資格。言之亦甚可笑。然亦可見其競選之劇烈矣。競選手段。當亦必無所不用其極。民政黨以此次必勝自誇。惟吾人甚望其勿採用買收手段。致蹈政友内閣之覆轍。政友會亦應以前度失敗爲鑒。而力除此種卑劣手段。各以正道競選。始有勝負可言不然。今日選舉上之勝利。必不敵將來政治上之失敗也。</p>

<h3 id="c77">殷墟古物之重要發現 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>最古雕刻··彩粙磁器</p>
<p>銅模銅器··麒麟頭骨</p>
<p>北平全國歷史語言研究所主任李濟博士、爲哈佛大學卒業生、美國斯密森學社社員、近頃在河南安陽、用科學方法、從事發掘、發現殷代古物甚富、性質頗爲重要、茲篇係北平英文導報主筆洪德Ｍｒ·ＡｄｗａｒｄＨｕｎｔｅｒ根據李君談話所撰、特譯述如次、以饗閱者、</p>
<p>（近頃在河南發現之古蹟、其價値足可令中國美術文化社會史之數頁、勢必重行編定、茲將重要發現、攝要臚列於下、　　一·發現中國最古雕刻、較尋常擬議者約早一千五百年、</p>
<p>二·發現上粙之彩繪磁器、無疑爲商代（西曆紀元前一七六六至一一二二年）收藏之品、此項古物製成期、仍在商代以　前、由此可證明上粙磁器之發明、較尋常擬議者早一千年以外、</p>
<p>三·發現商代銅模與白銅器、此爲第一次發現之商代銅模、</p>
<p>由上項發現、足證明三千年前、中國人民已有古玩癖好、與今日鑑賞家之好古無異、此外並由骨質上所刻文字、證明神話中盛傳之麒麟、確有其物、乃爲一獨角之兇、此外並發現刻字之龜甲牛骨等數百件、係當時用以占卜者、</p>
<p>發掘地點、在曩隸彰德之安陽縣小村鎭、是間爲殷商故都所在、當中原擾攘之秋、發掘工作、迄未中輟、近頃因時局匪禍以及當地人民違信風水之種種原因、工作暫行停頓、按殷墟首先發現年代在已亥年、（前清光緒二十五年）曾在彼掘得骨刻數具、自是以來、發掘工作、時作時輟、但古物被摧殘者、較諸能保存者爲多、蓋當時發掘多附近蠢蠢無知之村農、與古董商販、是輩均無科學知識、當時祇知搜求一二骨刻、轉鬻外人、以供博物院之陳設、是種文字爲四千年以外之物、在中國爲最古、至晚近數年、始用詳細發掘工作、而主要品、則在近數月來方始發現、大部分現存北海歷史研究所中、茲將重要發現詳述如次、</p>
<p>（一）雕刻此項雕刻、係由李濟君發現、已折爲三段、凑集一處尙爲可觀、此器作一人蹲踞狀、祇有自腰至脛一小部存在、器高數英尺、雙手握腿部、雙臂一部分仍在、據李君稱、此器無疑爲商代之物、其發現在偏僻地點、未經後人擾及、雕刻臂上鏤有花紋、係爲古制、此器古色古香、的爲商代之品、其年代至少在三千二百年前、校現時所知之中國古代雕刻、早一千五百年、較諸在商代以前之巴比倫與埃及式樣、逈不相侔、</p>
<p>（二）磁器此項磁器上附有磁釉、亦爲此次之一大發現、此磁器决非商代之物、因其與商磁絶異、或爲他處携來之品、據李君揣測、或係當時好古家所藏、其製成年代、當在商以前約一千年、磁器發現地曾遭洪水、境頗荒僻、當年曾爲黄河流經之處、但河流已多變遷、據地質學家言、該地曾遭洪水四次、古磁發現磁釉一事、頗佔重要、蓋尋常以爲磁釉發明係在漢代（紀元前二百年起）也、</p>
<p>（三）銅模與白銅器、此亦爲一驚人之發現、前此頗有人主張商代已有白銅器、今屆始首次獲得確證、銅模爲商代發明、並且發現商代玉器、據現時得知、周代（紀元前一一二二年至二五五年）雖發明新社會制度、而對於美術、則頗承襲殷制、（四）龜甲與牛骨、發現之龜甲與牛骨、上有小孔、係由木炭製成、微露裂痕、此即占卜時之問答、此外去秋發現品有銅碗箭鏃銅槍頭等、均係商代之物、並有石刻、與周代玉器相類、殆周人襲取商之遺制歟、尙有鏤刻石丸多具、青玉斧一柄、至爲美觀、並另有商代白玉數事、</p>
<p>（五）麒麟此外無意中發現獸顱一具、上刻文字、可證明麒麟在古時確有其物、乃係一獨角之兇、馬哥孛羅書中述及麒麟、亦作此說、大槪可信爲確鑿也、</p>

<p>子曹子名家達。字頴甫。江陰人。性疏懶。拙於治家人生產。讀翁文端詩。有不信營巢拙似鳩語。喟然曰。斯言類我。因以拙巢爲號。少從吳茂才夢庚游。始學爲詩。然碌碌無所表見。旣游庠。從陳子服門下十二年。學制舉。頗刻勵。會嘉定秦芍舲敎諭是邑。賞其才。日夕與讑經史。始嶄然露頭角。壬寅舉孝廉、詣芍舲。芍舲曰。以子之才。用子之學。僕果知子之必選也。而發言最犯時忌奈何。未幾。芍舲以咸豐知縣去江陰。曹子漠然無所向。旣而以揀選知縣赴山東。亦無所合。困而歸。而國變起矣。子曹子貎清癯。行無矩步。積垢頸項。墨痕沾襟袖殆遍。性梗直。理有不可。雖稠人廣坐中。面折人過不肯匿。或憾之。亦莫如何。與儲花鋤南强。張雄伯家鎭。蔣竹莊維喬。金松岑天羽。丁仲祜福保輩同學。僉呼曹戆而不名。於學無不通。尤長於詩。嗣響漁洋。五七古直欲駕而上之。國變後蓄髮不薙。僑寓雲間。授徒以自給。絶口不談世事。家無隔宿糧。風雨中吟聲淵淵出金石。怡然得天趣。工長短句。清麗近白石道人。癸亥冬。伯未與子曹子步城西。觀古木寒鴉。歸時倚案挑燈。塡滿江紅詞。伯未先成。有句云。近黄昏殘照一絲絲。增嗚咽。子曹子見之曰。是使我擱筆也。竟不終篇。工墨梅。瓣香冬心。萼枝宛約。細柔輕圓。或三年不獲一幅。或一日畫數十幅。人莫測其藴。平居不嗜酒。飲蕉葉許輒醉。醉則起舞。嗚嗚歌崑曲。然坐次瓦甑玻瓶。縱横若列宿。掇桂英。市檸檬玫瑰漬之。備辛甘酸五味。遇酒客覓杯晋曰。此盥孚酒也。此伯未酒也。又酌曰。此吾之所喜也。蓋以盥孚好辛。余好甘。而本人則惟酸是嗜云。性愛花。小庭中磚石隙處遍植之。又常曳盥孚往郊外捋野菊。跳躍荒墳蔓草間。</p>
<p>以爲樂。又愛茹齊菜。藏小刃。提藤筐。四出覓之。新雨初過。匐伏徑畦。泥濘沾衣靴不惜。其疏狂之態。非常人所有也。故人多顯貴。子曹子未嘗有所干謁。或諷之。怫然曰。我苟稍屈節。早踞要津矣。何尙侘傺若是。餓死溝　。我甘之。露朝星晚。</p>
<p>時與吳昌碩俊卿相唱酬。顧嘗謂知曹子之深者。莫盥孚伯未若也。</p>

<p>— 湯筆花</p>
<p>清早起來。到麵館裏去吃麵。最爲合算。因爲早上的麵。比較不論什麽時候要來得多。一過九點鐘。吃起麵來。就要少去許多。不信。一試便知。</p>
<p>落雨天走在路上。遇着汽車駛過。泥土四濺。很覺討厭。倘將傘柄横斜。拿傘頂抵抗。那麽泥水都濺在傘上。</p>
<p>托外埠親友向郵向郵局匯欵。最好請對方在匯票上寫明離開自已很近的郵局。即某某路郵局等字樣。拿起欵來。可以便當許多。否則不論遠近。總要跑到總局裏去。多麻煩呀。</p>
<h3 id="c109">雀牌記趣 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— 顏也</p>
<p>雀牌一物。已成爲國人普遍之嗜好。城市中無論矣。山野之目不識丁者。亦多知中發東西也。一昨與友人談雀。中有不少趣事。爰錄一二。以付自由談。</p>
<p>浦東某地。於雀牌中之二萬。每呼之曰敏華。詢其故。則此中有滄桑焉。當遜清末葉。該地有曰敏榮者。本極寒微。不料於某年忽得窖金達兩萬。於是窶人子頓爲富翁矣。敏榮以富而無人知。猶衣錦夜行。爰即日鳩工庀材。大興第宅。歷時半載。耗金八千。華厦始成。鄉人之，過者。皆嘖嘖羨之。顧敏華以旣富矣。猶未貴也。又拆鉅金捐得一官。於是門置旗牌。居然宦第。奴僕如雲。頣指氣使。旣富且貴。彼願償矣。庸詎知好景不常。忽武昌舉義。清社捐棄。敏榮之貴。遂不爲人重。而數載浪費。囊中亦金盡。依舊貧且賤矣。今日彼地之年屆而立者。均目擊之。以彼之二萬金揮之甚易。故羣名雀牌中之二萬曰敏華。無人不呼二萬爲敏榮。無人不知敏榮即二萬。嗚呼敏榮。亦足以豪矣。</p>
<p>昔日江蘇省立第二師範學校。有一美婦敎授英文。一日於上課時。忽謂學生曰。貴國之麻雀牌。有組織。有變化。吾甚好之。爾等亦多擅此乎。衆對曰。麻雀牌爲下等社會人之游戲品。知識階級者不屑爲也。美婦曰。此言吾不信。吾固常見貴國之達官鉅富以及敎師學生等皆好此。豈若輩亦皆下流社會中人乎。然則貴國人民俱爲下流矣。衆生爲其一語道破。咸面紅無以答。</p>
<p>無錫東亭鎭某茶室中有一雀戰聯。甚趣。辭爲（一局旣成。中發白碰出三元。恰逢海底裏取寳。八圈未終。洞索萬做得一色。更遇崗頭上開花。）胡雀興者見之。其亦手癢難熬乎。</p>
<p>有某縣長在其治下厲行禁賭。人多賢之。一日縣長以事入京。朋輩相見。以雀戰遣深宵。忽數警入。俱執去。縣長急改姓字。並有承曰商人。警署以其服禦非寒酸。嚴判罰百金。縣長囊中固充盈。急繳納而出。人聞之。咸謂縣長素捉賭罰人者。今爲人捉。爲人詞。是以其人之道還治其人之身也。</p>
<h3 id="c110">紀交大之新宿舍 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 志政</p>
<p>滬西交通大學。自孫黎二氏長校以後。校務方面。頗多進展。客歲當局鑒于學生宿舍不敷應用。復有新宿舍之建。鳩工以來。凡歷半載。迄今春而工竣。其中設備之精良。建築之别致、有得而述者。因略記之。</p>
<p>新宿舍之基地。位于體育館之後方。蓋前凌竹銘長校時所購置者也。舍作Ｕ字形。凡三層。計一百餘間。樓下設大室二。一曰閱報室。陳列書報甚多。一曰交誼室。爲集會之用。佈置皆極澹雅。每臥室二人。内有洋木衣櫉一。左角一巨鏡。備整衣之用。桌椅書架與櫉同色。皆購自新新公司者。床爲新式鋼絲墊。柔軟舒適兼而有之。四壁作淡黄。頂則爲白色。一窗至巨。故室中空氣光線均佳。各室同學。喬遷至此。莫不爭妍鬥艶。將室内佈置一新。壁間或懸彩畫。或掛字屏。中西方式。皆饒有藝術思想。餘若盥洗室則冷熱水管滿列壁上。便所則悉仿歐式。置身其中。如入一偉大之旅社。國内大學中。殆以此爲首屈一指矣。舍前新築一大道。繞舍而過。直達校外。惟刻猶未蕆事也。舍外有廣場。其左翠柏成林。空氣之佳。實罕倫比。聞春假期間。該校將正式舉行開幕典禮。同時並邀外界參觀。逆料屆時必有一番盛况也。</p>
<h3 id="c111">續怕妻隨筆 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— 夢綺</p>
<p>日前看見本談上蘭莤君的怕妻隨筆。雖是一個小問題。却也有研究的價値。而且饒有神秘的意味。不憚辭費。也來談談。</p>
<p>我覺得常有許多人以爲男子爲什麽怕妻。照男女平等的原則上說。固然不應當怕。即使妻子蠻不講理。也不會無法對付。其實這種見解是謬誤的。怕的動機。根本上是由於愛。所以這種怕。和怕父母師長的怕是截然不同的。因爲愛。於是事事便不免隨便縱容。結果不論妻的話是否對不對。妻的要求是否合理。無一不容納。到了這時。便達到怕的程度了。</p>
<p>還有些人說。其實也無所謂怕呀。不過女子氣量小。遇事過於認眞。拂了伊的意思。每每哭哭啼啼。閙得家庭不安。萬一氣出病來。更是因小失大。所以不如讓步些。這種見解。確有理由。但歸根結局。依然還是愛的原動力。</p>
<p>新婚或是未婚而有了愛人的朋友說。怕妻是極有趣味的喜劇。試想當你愛人</p>
<p>向你要求一件事時。即使無理到萬分。但看了伊的樣兒。已足使你沈醉了。如果不允許。那麽伊撒嬌撒痴。嗚嗚的哭起來。無論如何。也终要忍痛接受。到底屈服。事雖近於滑稽。但也着實有些味兒。這一種的怕。自然更是愛的表現。</p>
<p>根據以上的幾點。我們可以得到一個結論。就是凡是怕妻的。一定是愛情十分濃厚的。我希望大家都怕妻吧。</p>
<p>以上是談的怕妻原因。再談怕妻的結果。誠然。有些人因爲内務部閫令森嚴。行動不能自由。引爲苦事。但我以爲一個人如果怕妻時。那麽。他總可以少有些陷於罪惡的機會。錢少用些。道德也不致於墮落。脾氣也可好得多。讀者不信我的話嗎。我且介紹美國小說家華盛頓歐文的一句名句。他說。（那些在外面待人接物和藹可親的男子。一定是在家裏受過悍妻的訓練過的。）是嗎。</p>

<p>第九回諸名士閙笑捉迷藏一嬌娘任情施擁護</p>
<p>而且這不但於婦女們的心理不合。。也實在與大衆的心理背道而馳。。無論那種事物。。大而政治社會。。小至極瑣屑的事。。總盼望時時刻刻換點新鮮花樣。。况且婦女的衣飾。。尙在變換。。往往上半年所做的衣服。。到了下半年已不流行。。甚至於無可翻騰。。依舊重流行古代衣冠。。現在大阿姨開出箱子來。。滿滿的一箱子。。都是蕊雲的阿姊遺留下來的。。有的還似剪刀口裏新做出來的一般。。但是第一是式樣。。第二是花色。。完全是個過去時代的東西。。可憐那些衣服。。好似一個人髣髴。。還没有出過風頭。。已經是做了落伍者了。。大阿姨要騙蕊雲穿那種衣服。。便哄小孩子似的。。說那衣服。。做的時候花了許多錢。。蕊雲也知道這話是確實的。。無奈伊是一天到晚在那裏出當唱的。。看見人家穿了各色各樣爭奇鬭妍的衣服。。自已却穿了那種老古董衣服。。怎樣的失色。。十五歲的小姑娘。。正想什麽都要勝過人的時候。。自然滿肚皮的不起勁。。後來還是阿金說了。。伊說阿囡現在堂唱這樣的多。。走到檯面上。。也要幾件好看點的衣棠。。這種衣服是不大時行的了。。大阿姨那總没法。。呌阿金明天陪了阿囡自已到老介福去剪。。現在做小先生。。只好委屈點。。將來怕没有頂好的衣服穿嗎。。大阿姨的意思。。以爲堂子裏姑娘的衣飾。。總是靠在客人身上的。。那纔阿金陪了伊去剪了一套衣服。。可是大阿姨吩咐只可以做單的。。這套衣服。。便做了掛出朝衣。。裏面無論是皮的棉的夾的。。却把新做的那套衣服。。在外面一罩。。不拘什麽古董衣服。。都罩在裏面了。。有人說伊（金玉其外。。敗絮其中。。）其實敗絮也不是敗絮。。好像是中國一班名士。。古舊冬烘的頭腦。。却把那些新學問做了一點皮毛。。目空一切。。而且也就是那套衣服。。冬天也是他。。春天也是他。。人家打趣伊。。說人那套衣服。。可穿秋冬春三季。。除却夏天。。其餘都可以穿。。可以呌做三季衣服。。蕊雲氣得哭了好幾塲。。伊在家裏穿了拖了片。。掛一塊的破棉襖。。却跳出跳進。。自得其樂。。從來没有爲了没有衣服穿而哭過。。現在因爲自已的衣服略爲有些不時式而慟哭。。這可見時代不同。。環境不同。。但要改換了人生。。但蕊雲是個天眞漫爛的女孩子。。一回兒心裏不高興。。哭了一塲。。一回兒又在那裏嬉笑了。。</p>

<h3 id="c210">最近的捷克斯拉夫文壇 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>在大多數的非斯拉夫人看起來、現代捷克斯拉夫文學底代表就是南格爾（FｒａｎｔｉｓｅｋＬａｎｇｅｒ）和　卜貝克</p>
<p>（ＫａｒｌＣａｐｅｋ）兩人、但其實並不是這樣、從個人方面看起來、他們確是現代捷克文壇底俊傑、但是對於現代捷克的文學運動、他們的勢力却是小得很、卡貝克自從前次發表了他的（創造者亞當）那部劇本、而得到冷淡的歡迎以後、到現在只出過一部短篇小說集、而且他的時間一大半都用在種花自娱、和每天替Ｌｉｄｏｖｅｎｏｖｉｎｙ（捷克最好的報纸之一）寫一篇談人物事件的文章、至於南格爾呢、他最近的喜劇（劈司脫底轉變）確是得到很大的成功、能夠用詼諧的筆墨寫出一個旅館底門房如保因了一位救世軍姑娘底勸說而成爲宗敎信徒、但是這部劇本並不是十分偉大的作品、是不及他的傑作（拜列番利）（Ｐｅｒｉｐｈｅｒｉｅ）的、所以這兩人都不是最近捷克文壇底重要人物、除了他們以外、捷克還有好些重要的小說家詩人和戲劇家呢、可惜因爲他們的作品没有被人譯成外國文的缘故、他們在外國没有什麽人知道、</p>
<p>捷克斯拉夫文學、和捷克斯拉夫那個國度一樣、現在正經過一個（轉變的時期、）一直到現在、他在生活·商業·文學·藝術·建築等等方面、都還是吸收着外國文化、而没有替自已創造、書籍的市塲是正充盈着各國底翻譯作品、英美法德俄北歐底現代傑著、戰前底那種反抗文學已經失去了存在的理由、而没有立　足的餘地、至於新的民族文藝派呢、至今還没有站穏、雖然現在已經有幾個主張鮮明的集團、用一種修正的形式、進行着民族精神的創作、這些集團底最主要的一個、就是那軍隊派、）Ｌｅｇｉｏｎｒｉｅｓ）這一派之所以如此稱呌者、是因爲内中的作家、在歐戰的時候、差不多每次打仗、都是在前綫、</p>
<p>戰爭</p>
<p>一直是、而且至今還是、捷克小說家底主要題材、不過他們所寫的戰事、並不是抽象的、都是捷克軍隊在俄羅斯塞爾比亞底經歷底寫實的叙述、這一派之中底最重要的作家是</p>
<p>考泊打</p>
<p>（ＪａｏｓｅｐｈＫｏｐｔａ）和克拉托支維爾（ＪａｉｏｓｌａｖＫｒａｔｏｃｈｖｉｌ）考泊打新近剛做完他那三部曲底第三部、這個三部曲、頭兩部是描寫捷克人和赤俄的可怕的戰鬥、以及經過西伯利亞進軍到海參崴的悲劇的、現在這部第三卷、名叫ＦｒｅｔｉＲｏｔａＤｏｍａ（第三營回國）、則是寫的捷軍回到他們那獲得自由的新國度之後的幻滅的情態、考泊打底這部作品寫得很是眞實、他確是兵士們底喉舌、克拉托支維爾和他却不同了、他是偏於藝術家和事件解釋者那方面的、他的ＣｅｓｔａＲｅｖｏｌｕｃｅ（革命之道）、是寫西伯利亞戰爭的悲劇、他現在正在著一部小說、亦是以西伯利亞做背景、還没有完全發表出來、不過就已發表的一小部份看起來、這部作品是很可以成爲一部眞正偉大的捷克小說的、</p>
<p>我們如果要了解現代捷克斯拉夫底多方面的情况、我們就不可不研究研究、</p>
<p>杜列支</p>
<p>（ＪａｒｏｓｌａｖＤｅｒｙｃｂ）底個性、不可不讀一讀他的詩歌、戲曲、小說、論文、和小册子等等、因爲從這些我們可以看出他那種多方面的個性、這位信奉羅馬天主敎的（天眞直率的孩子）（Ｅｎｌａｎｔｔｅｒｒｉｂｌｅｏ）是一個大量生產的作家、他新近出了詩集Ｐｅｎｉｎｋｙ（鄉下姑娘）、長篇小說ＮａＨｒａｃｈ（在高處）以後、接着又出了一部三大卷的傳記小說Ｂｌｏｄｅｎｉ（錯誤）、這是對於三十年戰爭底名將華倫斯丹因伯爵ＣｏｕｎｔＷａｌｌｅｎｓｔｅｉｎ的續密的研究、</p>
<p>班奈斯</p>
<p>）Ｋ·ＪＢｅｎｅｓ）底小說）赤夏）（ＲｕｄｅＬｅｔｏ）是一套寫一個整個時代的巨著底第一部、這部巨著底目的是在於把戰後的捷克社會完全描寫出來、（赤夏）寫到一九二零年底夏季、鮑爾昔維克威逼捷境的時候、當時捷克社會底慌張惶亂的狀態、我們可以在這部小說裏看到、此外、伐采克（ＥｍｉｌＶａｃｈｅｋ）也是一個作品豐富的作家、藝術家和新聞家、他是一個很出名的自然主義者、最擅長那種描寫最下層社會生活的寫實小說、他新近的那部小說（寄生蟲）、詳盡地描畫出社會中寄生蟲階級底戰後生活、馬利亞（ｌａｒｏｓｌａｖＭａｒｉ）也是寫社會生活的、不過他所寫的都是現社會底悲觀的、病理的研究、這是從他那部三卷的長篇小說ＯｒｌｏｖｅａＳｔｒｉｚｌｉｃｉ（鷹與鷦）裏可以看出來的、郎根（Ａ、Ｌｏｎｇｅｎ）底小說Ｈｅｒｅｃｋａ（一女伶對於注意捷克藝術生活和劇塲生活的人很有價値、因爲他這部小說寫的是他的妻底生活、而他的妻是現代派的一個女伶、這些都是較重要的小說家、至於　　文學批評</p>
<p>尤其是那種學者態度的文學批評、捷克是一點也不缺乏、自從捷克最偉大的詩人伯利率那（ＯｔａｋａｒＢｒｅｚｉｎａ）去世以後、捷克的批評界頓形熱閙起來、關於這位大詩人的研究賞鑒的書出了許多、最値得注意的那兩本Ｈｏｖ发ｏｒｙ　ｓ　Ｏｔａｋａｒｅｍ　Ｂｒｅｚｉｎｏ（和利率那的對話）一本是壁可伐·沙特可伐夫人（Ｐｊｃｋｏｖａ，Ｓａｕｐｋｏｖａ）所作、這位夫人是伯利率那底最好的德文翻譯者底老婆、一本是丹姆爾（ＪａｋｕｂＤｅｍｌ做的、丹姆爾是捷克天主敎復興的重要人物之一、詩人詩摯友、他們所紀的詩人底談話都很有趣味和表現的力量、在目前的評壇、</p>
<p>戈哀茲</p>
<p>（ＦｒａｎｔｉｓｅｋＧｏｅｔｚ）是捷克青年底最重要的代表、他不久要出版一部題名ＴｖａｒＳｔｏｌｅｔｅ（當代面目）的批評論集、講到當代作家底主要的傾向、此外、體奇（ＫａｒＴｉｅｇｅ）是文學藝術上極端現代派底最伶俐聰明的理論家、他有兩部新著Ｏｎｕｍｏｒｕ，Ｃｌｏｗｎｅｃｚ，ａ　ｄａｄｉｓｔｅｃｈ（論幽默小丑及霴霴主義者）和Ｍｏｄｅｉｎｉ　ａｒｃｂｉｌｅｃｔｕｒｅ　ｖ　ｃｅｓｋｏｓｌｏｖｅｎｓｈｕ（現代捷克彫刻）</p>
<p>近代的詩歌</p>
<p>是全然抒情的、而且都是一班青年人在幹着、戰前那一代老輩作家不是死了就是停筆了、在捷克詩裏法國的影響是很顯明的、青年詩人中没有十分偉大的、比較起來、奈干伐（Ｖｉｔｅｚｓｌａｖ　Ｎｅｚｖａｌ）西女爾（Ｊａｒｏｓｌａｖ　Ｓｅｉｆｅｒｔ）和霍拉（Ｈｏｒａ）最爲重要、</p>
<h3 id="c211">刺戟美與破調美 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 日葵</p>
<p>（各種的時代、各種的階級都在牠的歷史的發達的各階段中發見又創造了各種的（美）、有時候所發見的是人間裡形之美、靜物之美、更有時候是悲壯之美、色情之美、妖怪之美、而這些美、有些跟時代一同消失、有些跟時代一同變了姿態、而到現在那是大都會和機械的美、俱各反映在近代藝術中、）</p>
<p>以上是日本無產階級文藝理論介紹專家藏原惟人民在（新藝術形式的探求一一文中的一段議論、現在借引在這裏、當作本文的冒頭語、以指示美的基準是其有移動性的、特别是近代的文藝作品中、除了謳歌都會的美與機械的美以外、輓近又新發見了刺戟美、破調美、野蠻美以及黑人文明的美｀｀｀｀｀等等、關於（野蠻美）與（黑人文明美）等暫且不說、我們先來檢討一下（刺戟美）與（破調美）的問題、</p>
<p>美的基準是具有活動性而非固定不移的、或徐緩、或急激、雖其推移不同、但要而言之、絶對固定的美之基準是没有的、</p>
<p>以大體而論、美可分兩大典型、一爲動的美、一爲靜的美、前者是憑藉着現存的生活而進取、後者則僅受支配於人的頭腦與心臓、在動的美一方面、最生動活躍的莫過於刺戟美、其强度至高烈、實爲近代美中最頂點的一種、</p>
<p>東方人的生活與思想、向來好求安定平靜、所以在文藝上所表現的、都拘囿於靜的美一方面、西方人的生活與思想、都承繼希臘藝術文化的道統、所以一切都是追求狂熱與動搖、他們的生活美、就是極度的動搖與不安、他們的藝術美、就是銳敏的感受與潑刺的刺戟、</p>
<p>現在撇開抽像空洞的講義式文字、</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>拿出現實的證據、來示刺戟美影響於近代人生的一班、</p>
<p>打開每天的報紙來看、三分之一都是影戲院大幅的廣告、统計上海三十多家戲院開映的影片、那一家不是榜着（浪漫肉感）（誘惑刺戟）一類的號召標語、本來看影戲就是代表近代刺戟生活的一種、化少許金錢的代價、在一二小時内、可以看到許多可歌可泣、悲歡離合或是滑稽突梯的人生縮影、試問仰首坐在銀幕前的一般觀客、那一個不是爲了求精神上的興奮、神經上的刺戟而去的呢、</p>
<p>再就輓近盛行的足球呀、賽馬呀、跑狗呀、這許多點綴都會生活的狂熱運動、那一種不是可以使人得到刺戟快感的遊戲嗎、</p>
<p>咖啡店與跳舞塲的林立、不用說得、都是强烈的刺戟塲所、園林式的幽雅茶館、彈詞唱曲的書塲、都將漸渐的成爲淘汰的東西、現在流行的、是由妙齡女郎招待的ＣａｆｅｅｔＲｅｓｔａｕｒａｎｔ奏演速力旋律的Ｊａｚｚａ音樂、與活潑颿風騒的舞女明星｀｀｀｀｀｀總之一切的生活享受、那一件不是動的美與刺戟美的表現呢、</p>
<p>現在再說幾句關於（破調美）的問題過去的藝術、與美的基準、是傾嚮於（調和）與（均齊）二大特徵、自從封建主義崩壈以後、古典派的藝術也跟着破產、近代的藝術家們都不能享受安定的生活秩序、大家都没有餘暇去琢磨（調和）與（均齊）的作品、於是（破調美）的藝術就應時產生了、</p>
<p>藝術文化到了爛熟的時期、漸次傾向於破調方面、原來是歷史上進化移進所應有的現象、</p>
<p>古典派音樂的要素、就是（諧和）、近代的音樂、却轉換了一大方嚮、流行雜亂的狂噪曲、破棄傳统的作曲規範、導入刺戟的野蠻民謠、這是（破調美）佔居近代藝術的一大徵象、</p>
<p>又繪畫方面、廢除了洗煉性的色彩、傾向到單純的原色、赤·青·黄·白·黑等最富於强烈刺戟性的色彩、都爲近代一般畫家所樂用、在女性裝飾方面、更可以覘見單純原色的澎漲勢力、黑鳥絨的旗袍、肉色的絲襪、其他若蒼白的美容粉、眉黑·日紅等等、都是表露單純化刺戟化的（破調美）、</p>
<p>在女性裝飾方面最顯明的破調美、莫過於剪髮·裸脚·及冬季風靡一時的半统襪套這三件流行時髦了、</p>
<p>研究近代藝術的、對於（刺戟美）與（破調美）這兩大傾向、無論如何、是不應該疏忽的、</p>

<p>最近出版界、以傳述偉人名士之經</p>
<p>歷勳績之作品、在一般讀物中、發生最受歡迎之傾向、其次如談論父親、讚美丈夫、或紹介其妻子之半面生活之一般新聞雜誌上所記誌之趣味讀物、亦爲人喜閱、現代著名之大實業家大政治家如愛迪生、華乃美克、福特、慕索里尼等之自叙傳及評傳等等、出版甚夥、而讀者亦日盛、最近如預約出版巴魯達克之英雄傳之計劃、及杉森孝次郎氏之論新時代英雄崇拜論之社會的意義等等、均爲現代民衆崇拜英雄熱之鐵證、</p>
<p>傳記文學之特點、在其能立脚於各人物之現實生活狀况上、如欲紹介某種狀况人物時、即將某人物之產生時代及其精神、傳述詳盡、故讀古今中外偉人豪俊之傳記、即能明瞭世界之歷史、反之、能貫通世界之歷史時、則於偉人奇士之勳績、亦可瞭如指掌、少年時代能於傳記文學中感覺興味者、以其能因此而可通曉社會上之豐富知識、與能涵養多分高尙之情操故耳、歐美各國所有關於世界大戰之政治家軍人等之軼事、彚而成書、且附以戰爭之原因及印象、以傳記文學性質、公諸於世、曾被戰爭蹂躍之國土、其社會之改造、產業之振興、在在俱需人民之努力、自覺之民衆、對於此等偉人傑士等之傳記、其心身所受之刺戟、自不難設想、在一切均爲民衆化集團化之近世、忽一變爲崇拜英雄熱、驟睹之、幾有疑爲時代錯誤之舉、然一觀及多數民衆正準備以過去之偉人傑士之思想功績爲開拓新生活之目標時、則又宜爽然自釋矣、</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Central Government’s Attitude toward the Current Situation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Publicity Department Hosts Press Reception; Sun Ke Attends to Report</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 2 p.m. on the twentieth, the Publicity Department hosted a reception for the press, chaired by Ye Chucang, and specially invited Central Committee member Sun Ke to report on the Central Government’s attitude toward the current situation. Sun Ke’s report was as follows:</p>
<p>He began by noting that a slogan has recently circulated domestically and abroad: “Party affairs are for party members to resolve; national affairs are for citizens to resolve.” This is quite inappropriate. He recalled that several years ago the Premier, at a reception in Guangzhou for party comrades, delivered a speech stating that since the founding of the Republic by overthrowing the Qing, the revolutionary work has not yet been completed because many ordinary party members were misled by two phrases—“revolutionary army by reactionaries” and “dissolve the party”—which delayed the Chinese revolution by more than ten years. When the Northern Expedition army reached Hebei the year before last, another slogan appeared in the north: “Party troops lovable; party members killable,” intended to buy the goodwill of armed comrades and collude with them to rebel against our party.</p>
<p>Mr. Yan’s current stance is derived entirely from that same thinking. He fails to recognize that without the party there would be no revolutionary army and no revolutionary military force. History over the past decade proves that without our party’s efforts and struggle, the country could never achieve peace. The fundamental elements of a nation are territory and popular sovereignty. If the Central Government’s orders are not obeyed nationwide, it cannot exercise sovereignty internally, much less externally. At this time of national reconstruction, if one rejects the party and leaves state affairs to an armed class, claiming that a few powerful individuals represent all the people, Mr. Yan’s view is gravely mistaken.</p>
<p>He also speaks of “courteous deference for the nation” and “responsibility in opposition.” Resigning from office may still allow one to bear responsibility, which is baffling. If, upon leaving office, one could still be responsible, then for opposition elites interfering in politics, would there exist a supreme government above the government? Outside our party, is there another force to control everything? Such a notion would not stop turmoil but create it.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, revolutionary forces reached the north. After nominal unification, most military leaders holding power did not fully grasp the present goal: concentrating military authority in the center and making the army the nation’s army. At the slightest central reorganization, they construed it as an encroachment on their power and sought to eliminate it, rebelling against the Center at every opportunity. Mr. Yan’s talk of courtesy is essentially a strategy of retreat to advance—outwardly passive, inwardly active. Recently he telegraphed the government saying that if the government were dissatisfied, there was no need for large-scale operations; a single order would suffice. Yet he has redeployed troops, detained trains, closed newspapers, and monitored central government agencies in the capital. Are these courteous gestures? Would a single order be truly obeyed?</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, if the Center were a corrupt bureaucratic government, it could have let things slide. But now it is a revolutionary government, still fighting the Northern Expedition in Guangzhou to eliminate northern warlords. This is the Central Government now recognized by the nation and the world. Would it remain courteous to Mr. Yan alone? If Mr. Yan fails to awaken, the Center will of course fulfill its revolutionary mission fully: when it speaks, it will act; if it must strike, it will strike. However, the government does not lightly favor mass mobilization, nor is this about contesting personal views or minority rights. It concerns the nation’s survival. At present, only the Kuomintang and the Three Principles of the People can unify China. Therefore our party will never shirk its responsibility. Anyone who raises troops to rebel will naturally be suppressed by force.</p>
<p>Recently many say China seeks peaceful unification. But if peace cannot unify, why not use force? No nation secures its sovereignty except by force. Moreover, our party wields principled force, different from the warlords’ unprincipled might. The claim that force cannot unify refers only to unprincipled force; principled force is the opposite. Most military comrades now are awakened; few respond to Mr. Yan’s call. The first person Mr. Yan sought to align with was Zhang Hanqing in the Northeast, who, understanding righteousness, not only refused but also sent a loyal telegram urging Mr. Yan to repent.</p>
<p>Although China’s future faces many dangers, thanks to such patriotic military men the overall picture is quite optimistic. China will not be crippled by one man’s delusions. Abroad, there may be much alarm, but the future is promising. We are very near true unification and soon will realize the people’s hopes. (Exclusive cable, 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Chen Guofu Urges Zhao Daiwen to Return to the Capital <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Guofu sent a telegram to Director Zhao Daiwen at Taiyuan and Mr. Ci in Long, confidential: I have received your Yangzhou telegram and am pleased to learn your departure for the capital is scheduled for mid-month and that the Supervisory Yuan’s establishment has a set date, which is most gratifying. However, you have not yet arrived past the deadline. I have been eagerly awaiting and heard you sent a telegram to Mr. Yang Gongjie stating your delay was only to mediate peace. This confirms your loyalty. Yet if you truly seek peace, the first step is to rectify discipline and enforce the rule of law; then schemers will be deterred. Had the Supervisory Yuan been established earlier, central appointees would have been under its strict oversight, and instigators would have dared not transgress. I appreciate your earnest efforts, yet fear they may not achieve peace. Our Yuan, burdened with great responsibility, cannot delay again and disappoint public expectations or the Center’s resolve. The Center has decided to set a firm deadline for establishment; it must be inaugurated as scheduled, without further delay. All preparations await your leadership. I therefore request your immediate departure south to advance this cause. I cannot express how eagerly I await you. Your younger brother, Chen Guofu. (Exclusive cable, 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Statement by Hu Hanmin <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Hope Yan Continues to Work for Party and Nation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the recent situation, Hu Hanmin said: Although Yan once adhered to party principles and served the revolution, for nineteen years he remained in Shanxi, witnessing the rise and fall of Beiyang warlords and lax northern governance. He could not help feeling pleased, seeing feudalism as natural and order as troublesome. But today Yan should clearly recognize the separation of central and local authority and his own position; he must not be blinded by old loyalties when proposing “courteous deference for the nation” and uniting the first three terms of Party leadership to resolve state affairs. These ideas treat the party and nation as personal property and assume the right to establish a dynastic rule. This is astonishing. Even if his intentions are benign, he gives the impression of threatening to use armed force to dominate central control. As an official appointed by the Center to serve local interests, such arrogance contravenes national law and Party discipline. How will he justify himself?</p>
<p>To the Center, he is a Central Committee member; to the government, an executive. If he has constructive proposals on party or national affairs, he should submit them to the Center. If he still wishes to travel abroad but truly aims to serve the party and nation, he may resign and depart quietly. Yet instead he spreads these incongruous statements. Since Tang Shengzhi’s defeat and Zhang Fakui’s failure, the country has returned to stability. Military men who support the Center and fully embrace the revolution should obey Central guidance and focus on revolutionary construction. Mr. Yan holds heavy responsibilities entrusted by the Center; every action of his impacts the larger picture. He should consolidate central authority, assist governance, and not trouble himself over trifles or produce shocking theories that disturb a settled situation. As the Buddha said, “Put down the butcher’s knife and become a Buddha on the spot.” We hope Yan will finally awaken and continue to work for party and nation with his original revolutionary zeal. We ask ourselves with a forgiving heart and no harsh demands: do not be fooled by disgruntled politicians who think they can deceive everyone. Neglecting to mend the pen after a sheep’s escape, or refusing to rein in a runaway horse above a cliff, sacrificing others while becoming their puppet, will only lead to disgrace, ruin, and global ridicule. This would be a true pity. (Exclusive cable, 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e17">On the Conduct and Outcome of Japan’s Election <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Japan’s elections concluded today, marking the end of campaigning by each political party. Of those concerned with the political situation, one might ask: Which will prevail, the Minseito or the Seiyūkai? I would argue that victory in voting is not the point; we should examine the campaign methods. Whether the Minseito or Seiyūkai is superior, the ultimate success of a party does not rest on the number of seats won, but on the quality of its methods. If a party employs unscrupulous tactics, winning a temporary majority, it will inevitably fail politically later. Journalists have already exposed two notorious shortcomings in both parties’ campaigns: first, use of violence to disrupt opponents; second, public speeches that attack others’ faults while praising their own merits. Yet these are not the greatest evils. The worst corruption is buying votes with money. Party strategists, aware of this, have monitored parties with ample funds for lavish spending. But how can such illegal actions be publicly restrained if allowed? Consider the previous election: at the time, no bribery cases were detected. Only later, when the Tanaka Cabinet fell over a bribery scandal, did bribery cases emerge—proof that buying votes is not easily discovered. Tanaka, leveraging Seiyūkai’s majority to manipulate politics, created an atmosphere of corruption and darkness, ultimately fell because of bribery. Thus, in political competition, it is not majority seats but legitimacy of methods that determines success.</p>
<p>In this campaign, both parties’ leaders, Hamaguchi and Inukai, crisscrossed the country nonstop making speeches to the point of exhaustion and even missing the voting period themselves. This is laughable, but it shows how fierce the campaign was; no doubt they deployed every extreme method. The Minseito confidently claims victory this time, but we hope it will avoid vote buying and repeating the Seiyūkai’s errors. The Seiyūkai should learn from its past failure and rigorously eliminate such despicable methods. Only by competing on the proper path can there be a real contest of victory and defeat; otherwise, a victory at the polls today will be political failure tomorrow.</p>

<p>Begins Boycott of American Cigarettes and Shows Signs of Expansion; 3,000 Students Strike in Protest; Local Communists Take Advantage of the Opportunity</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Manila on the 19th reports that American exclusion of Filipinos has stirred surprise over hopes for Philippine independence, leading to numerous incidents in Manila over the past two days, causing concern. Filipinos have begun secretly boycotting American cigarettes; anyone spotted smoking American brands is beaten. In the past 24 hours, there have been at least thirty reported injuries. Organizers plan to expand the boycott. Shops now dare not display American cigarettes. In northern Manila, 3,000 university students have struck, demanding the dismissal of an American teacher accused of insulting them; he denies the charges. The education superintendent has formed a committee to investigate. The city council is also convening to discuss the matter. Students carried banners in a citywide procession today. The Communist Party, taking advantage of the strike, distributed a pamphlet encouraging students, criticizing Philippine leaders, and urging Filipino youth to organize—signed the Anti‑Imperialist Youth League. Authorities remain calm. A large independence meeting is scheduled for Saturday, which has fueled public sentiment. The Manila Times—the oldest American newspaper in the Philippines—will suspend publication on March 15. While many speculate this is related to recent events, it is said to be coincidental.</p>

<p>London Meeting Suspended for One Week Under Influence of French Political Turmoil</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 19th reports Italy today issued a memorandum concerning the Five‑Power Naval Conference, stating it is willing to accept limitations on capital ships at the minimum level, provided no other continental power exceeds them. Though France is not explicitly named, it is clear Italy seeks parity with France. The memo also asserts Italy’s naval policy does not intend to compete with other nations’ armaments. After its release, Viscount Graniti told reporters there is nothing new in it—merely statements of faith, hope, equality, and disarmament—and he has not lost hope for the conference’s success. Today’s bulletin revealed that negotiations among the conference delegates have been suspended until February 26, while the expert subcommittee will complete its work on special warships. The submarine issue remains pending.</p>
<p>A Dentsu dispatch from London on the 19th quotes U.S. plenipotentiary Senator Robinson at a luncheon of the Associated Press that, regarding capital ship limitations, Washington Treaty extensions have debated the supplemental restrictions on cruisers, destroyers, and submarines. Efforts continue to establish a three‑way relationship among the U.S., U.K., and Japan equal to that of capital ships. He expressed high expectations. Observers say this effectively signals U.S. agreement to about 70% of Japan’s demands.</p>

<p>Nationwide Election Frenzy Concludes; Results to Be Known by the 23rd; Both Party Leaders Lose Voting Rights; Inukai Likely to Top the Polls</p>
<p>A Rengo dispatch from Tokyo on the 20th reports that Japan’s political campaign has concluded. Cabinet ministers who canvassed throughout the country will return to Tokyo within a day or two. By noon on the 23rd, election results will be known. Accordingly, the government has scheduled an extraordinary cabinet meeting for that day, inviting party‑affiliated ministers to discuss key strategies for the future government based on the election outcomes. They will consider three scenarios: (1) a party wins an absolute majority; (2) a party places first; (3) the governing party risks defeat. Based on these, they will decide the government’s stance, the timing of a special Diet session, and its agenda.</p>
<p>The Rengo dispatch reports that the second round of general election voting is held today from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. nationwide. Voters across the country head to the polls, exercising their civic right. By 11 a.m., over 500,000 votes had been cast, a significant drop from previous elections.</p>
<p>A Dentsu dispatch states that party president Inukai returned to Tokyo too late to vote; Prime Minister Hamaguchi also lost his voting eligibility due to insufficient intervening time after transferring his residence.</p>
<p>The Dentsu dispatch adds that in Okayama Prefecture, the Seiyūkai stronghold was nearly jeopardized as Minseitō leaders canvassed vigorously. Inukai rushed there to bolster his base, turning the tide. Now he is poised to be elected with the highest vote count. In Kagoshima, Takeshirō Tokoshimi, despite some doubts, is also expected to secure the top spot due to his popularity. By contrast, Shigeo Iwakiri will need a last‑ditch effort to win.</p>
<p>The Rengo dispatch quotes the Criminal Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Justice announcing that by the 19th, 625 cases of election law violations had been prosecuted.</p>

<p>A Reuters dispatch from Ahmedabad on the 20th reports that National Congress leader Gandhi published an article in his Young India newspaper stating: “The only danger in nonviolent resistance is the outbreak of violence. Should violence occur, I know how to handle it, unlike during the Bardoli affair (when rioters killed several police officers). Our nonviolent war of freedom will continue until not one representative of tyranny remains alive.” Asked whether he ultimately intends to resort to force against the British, Gandhi replied: “I hold nonviolence above all things worldly or spiritual. My pursuit of this movement stems from my love for Indians and even for the British. I am willing to endure suffering to change the hearts of the English, not to harm them.”</p>

<p>A Reuters dispatch from Paris on the 19th states Tardieu spent an hour at the Élysée today, and while he offered his opinions, he believes the prime minister should be chosen from among the parties that secured a majority in the Chamber on February 17 when they toppled the government. However, the president is concerned with maintaining France’s position and continuing negotiations at the London Naval Conference. Therefore, Tardieu remains undecided about forming a cabinet and cannot yet be considered resolute.</p>

<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 19th reports that the First Lord of the Admiralty, Mr. Alexander, told the House of Commons today that after April 1, the Royal Navy must cease supplying armed guards for merchant ships. However, Indian watchmen chosen from the Hong Kong police who distinguished themselves on the Haching ship may continue to be employed on merchant vessels after April 1 to guard against piracy. Conservative MP Haldane asked the Under‑Secretary for the Colonies, Mr. Hills, about a colonial office notice that Chinese in Hong Kong can sit for the examinations for ship’s master, mate, and chief engineer on the same terms as British subjects. Hills replied that Chinese cannot obtain certificates, only letters from the examiners attesting to their passing; holders of such letters do not gain certificate rights. This measure by the Hong Kong authorities had the British government’s approval. Foreign Secretary Henderson stated that negotiations on consular jurisdiction are ongoing; he could not disclose the instructions sent to Minister Sir John Jordan in Peking. He reaffirmed that any treaty must be submitted to the House of Commons for debate before ratification.</p>

<p>Plans to Begin with Fundraising; Already a Party; Contains Considerable Envy</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 19th reports that Sir Alfred Harmsworth, founder of the United Empire Party, stated their first step is to establish branch offices in each district; the second is to raise £100,000 for campaign funds, appointing former Prime Minister McKenna and chair of the American Tobacco Company Owen as treasurers. Sir Harmsworth is actively fundraising and declared that all party activities will be done openly. However, conventional politicians and the press have gradually made their attitudes clear: it is doubtful whether the founder can sway enough voters to fundamentally alter party politics. Party leaders remain silent; the Liberal and Labour parties refuse to dignify the new party with comment, while the Conservatives mockingly predict many will defect to the new party but sneer that free trade within the empire has long been a Conservative aim deemed impractical. They say the emergence of a Fourth Party merely weakens Conservative electoral strength against their common opponents. The Morning Post refused to publish the founder’s notice, accusing Harmsworth and Rosebery of political skulduggery. Canada is closely watching the new party’s formation, but commentary remains neutral.</p>

<p>Telegrams from Liu Zhi in Xuzhou, to all press agencies:</p>
<p>“To the Deputy Commander of the Taiyuan Garrison: The Premier’s instruction is that revolutionists have liberty, but party members have no freedom. Once a comrade accepts a party order, every word and deed—where one goes, what one says, one’s advances and withdrawals—must follow it as a model, with no room for hesitation. There is talk of courteous deferral toward General Guo, injudiciously elevated to senior positions, with invitations to rest and take on far‑reaching posts. I believe this is wrong. Our leaders devoted themselves to the party and country, sharing arduous tasks; they are not individuals, thus have no personal freedom. One cannot leave without central approval. What about party discipline and responsibility? Courteous deferral was once a virtue, but in a revolution not yet won, it is misplaced. Revolutionaries have the duty to secure the nation’s survival and the people’s welfare, with full commitment, struggle, and sacrifice to achieve final victory. One must not shirk responsibility or abandon the cause halfway. I admonish against courting courtesy and excuse‑making that mislead and harm the country. Recall the Premier’s selfless cession of power to President Yuan, which the nation celebrated, but Yuan’s betrayal broke unity and nearly shattered national sovereignty. Thus, idle talk of courtesy can produce lamentable outcomes. Now, internal strife continues, foreign powers encircle us, the people suffer, and national plans remain unsettled. Advocating deferral now abandons national security. Comrades must maintain discipline, share responsibility, support the center, implement principles, and strive actively without shirking or creating schisms that confuse public opinion. That is true party responsibility. I, with my long experience and clear sight, humbly submit these words in blunt sincerity, hoping for careful consideration—an honor for party and country. Respectfully, Liu Zhi.”</p>
<p>Telegrams from Liu Zhi et al. in Xuzhou, to all press agencies:</p>
<p>“Having read the joint telegraph from the heads of the five ministries—which is bitter medicine but sincere counsel—I am deeply moved. Military comrades especially feel compelled to strive. Our founding principle has always been that the world belongs to all, our party’s ultimate goal peace. This was the late Premier’s dying injunction and has guided Chairman Chiang and the central leaders: lead the nation, unify by the Northern Expedition, establish tutelage, reorganize and strengthen national defense—all for peace, party, and people. Yet some of our military officers still disregard principle and public will, clinging to old warlord tactics, hypocritically betraying party history and their own character, undermining reorganization, and rebelling against the center—painful indeed. Although thanks to party influence, we quelled reactionaries within a year and eliminated principal culprits, the damage to the nation’s vitality is incalculable. Veterans who joined the revolution know the hardships of nation‑building, and the shame of internal strife weighs heavily on us. I fervently hope our military leaders appreciate that the army is the nation’s force and the people’s protection, and will absolutely accept the directives of the five ministers, unwaveringly support the center, complete the reorganization, realize unification, avoid betraying history or becoming new spoilers. Let us, with fearless spirit, adopt an uncompromising stance, lead party comrades and the entire nation in unwavering pursuit of peaceful unification, fighting to the end. Anyone mustering troops to rebel, undermine unity, or crush the nation’s vitality will be abandoned by all the people. I respectfully submit this, hoping for careful consideration. Liu Zhi, Gu Zhutong, Jiang Dingwen, Xia Douyin, Chen Cheng, Chen Jicheng, Zhao Guantao, Xu Tingyao.”</p>

<p>The Central Propaganda Department today (the 20th) issued the following Address to Our Fellow Countrymen:</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen have long been sunk in a hellish quagmire, living a fate worse than that of beasts, drawn, haggard, moaning, and unable to extricate yourselves. Ever since last year’s recovery of Pingjin, all hoped to break these shackles and rejoice in freedom; the revolutionary banners and drums were just raised when the remnants of feudalism gathered, outwardly submissive but secretly looting, extorting, and oppressing, draining us of blood and flesh. They have cut off central government decrees so that our people cannot benefit from its policies, while shamelessly blaming the center for forgetting the people’s suffering. As days turn to months our anxiety deepens. Thus, our people hear the revolution’s call but see no real benefits, breeding doubt toward the Party and resentment against the center, unaware that they are already ensnared by reactionaries, abandoned in their plight. The feudal forces, having devised schemes of control, now openly conspire to break national unity, coerce the center, and plunge the country into chaos, causing unprecedented devastation across North China. Meanwhile, foreign invaders press daily, the people’s livelihood cries out for relief, and the feudal powers strive to sustain the last days of their dying authority, standing as enemies to our toiling, grief-stricken masses. If our countrymen desire survival and liberation, they must awaken at once and devise self-rescue plans, support a government that truly belongs to the people, and join in the struggle to reclaim our sacred freedom and pursue the path to happiness. The time is urgent; there can be no idle watching. We hereby proclaim to our beloved countrymen the central aims of maintaining peace, unifying the nation, and seeking rest and recovery:</p>
<p>In a unified state, command and training of the armed forces must be absolutely under the center; only when military power belongs to the nation can we repel foreign insults, quell internal disorder, and serve as the fortress of national welfare and the guarantee of our people’s survival. Since declaring political tutelage to unify the country, our Party has earnestly pursued this work: convening disarmament meetings time and again, reducing troop numbers, yet feudal warlords remain in their delusions, absurdly regarding armed forces—financed by the people—as personal talismans, to dominate localities, exploit the populace, and leave border defenses perilously weak. If this continues, how can the nation stand? The annihilation of the rebels Gui, Feng, Zhang, and Tang was the result of the people’s verdict. Still, some say the center should not use force to unify the nation, preferring to argue over personal rights, not knowing that the center’s military power is that of the people. Those who privately instigate disorder or oppress the people are the people’s mortal enemies; the center must, in accordance with the people’s will, suppress rebellion and punish traitors—this is its duty, not to be shirked. As for those who accept central orders yet refuse to guarantee national unity, who misappropriate part of the people’s forces to seize territory and wreak havoc, how will our countrymen judge them?

<h3 id="e70">Second Route Commander Liu Zhi Arrives in Xuzhou <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou dispatch—By order Liu Zhi, Second Route Commander, led his units to Xuzhou. Troops of the Second Route had already been arriving in Xuzhou and along the Tianjin–Pukou line. This morning (the 18th) Liu Zhi led the Second Route headquarters from the capital to Xuzhou. Upon receiving word, local authorities notified all sectors to welcome him at the station. At about 8:00 a.m., Gu Zhutong, Xu Tingyao, Chen Jicheng, Hu Zongnan, Tang Junde, Li Yutang, Li Sigu, and various regiment commanders and officers, as well as Longhai Railway Director Qian Zongze, arrived bearing welcome banners in enthusiastic greeting. The headquarters staff traveled north in two separate trains—the first carrying most staff, the second the Special Service Battalion. Liu Zhi himself, with a few aides, journeyed by through car on the Pukou line, departing Pubei at 7:00 p.m. last night and reaching Xuzhou at 10:00 a.m. today. After disembarking and exchanging greetings, he and Gu Zhutong boarded cars into the city to rest at the Garden Hotel. Reporters visited him there at noon. Dressed in a gray wool uniform and looking as vigorous as ever, he spoke as follows:</p>
<p>“I have been away from Xuzhou for a year. During that time I led campaigns against Gui, Feng, and Tang, often recalling the old garrison here. Now that I return, besides military affairs, I will strive to continue local reconstruction and complete unfinished tasks. However, the situation remains volatile, with hidden reactionaries stirring discord and some still clinging to feudal mindsets, seeking to exploit the moment for their own ends. This has prevented full social and national stability. Be aware that the center’s commitment to peaceful unification is unwavering. We only resorted to arms out of necessity, and past campaigns were all concluded swiftly. Those who betray the center will find no refuge. The press must uphold this justice, guide the people onto the path of peaceful unification, and thus secure the Party and nation and bring relief to the populace.”</p>
<p>The Second Route headquarters is now located in the former Tao-shu office. Liu Zhi arrived this afternoon to assume command. Already in Xuzhou are the 1st Section Chief Li Guosheng, 2nd Section Chief Zhang Xizhi, and 3rd Section Chief Zhou Xianshi; Section Chief Liu Yaoyang has not yet arrived; Deputy Adjutant Director Wang Zunwu is present; Military Justice Director Fang Qidao is still en route. The headquarters comprises only the General Staff, Adjutant, and Military Justice sections. The Special Service Battalion led by Chen Keping has likewise continued arriving to station with headquarters; the Military Police Company under Peng Zhongkuang and the Engineer Company under Pang Guojun arrived two days ago and are now encamped in Xuzhou.

<p>Liu Zhi Passes Bengbu en Route to Xuzhou</p>
<p>Bengbu dispatch—Since the arrival of the Central Army’s 1st and 3rd Divisions in Xuzhou for cantonment, the 11th Army under Ma Hongkui has been reassigned to southern Anhui, while the 49th Division under Ren Yingqi has moved to northern Anhui. Central Army units stationed along the Tianjin–Pukou and Longhai lines have now been unified. Over the past ten days troop movements and transportation between Xuzhou, Suzhou, Bengbu, and Pukou have been extremely busy. However, due to a shortage of locomotives and rolling stock on the Pukou line, troop transports have not yet become overcrowded. The cavalry sent to southern Anhui has completed departure; infantry divisions still under embarkation are heading to guard the areas of Guoyang, Mengcheng, Zhengyang, Huoqiu, and Shouzhou. That division has a transport office in Bengbu, which for days has shipped large quantities of military supplies westward via Bengbu. The 26th Division under Chen Yaohan—formerly reorganized from the Independent 1st Brigade—stationed around Huaiyuan and Shouzhou, has been ordered to Xuzhou under the command of 1st Army Commander Gu Zhutong. Yesterday (the 17th) at 3:00 p.m., the 1st Regiment departed Huaiyuan by rail; today (the 18th) at 3:00 p.m., the 1st Regiment also departed by rail, with further units to follow. Gu Zhutong’s 3rd Division in Bengbu was ordered to guard the Suzhou–Bengbu line; under Staff Officer Zou Wenhua it dispatched the 4th Regiment south to Suzhou for garrison and left two regiments in Bengbu; the division headquarters and directly attached troops moved to Sucheng. Due to vehicle shortages, troops marched on foot, departing in three waves from the 16th to complete the movement. On the 16th the 4th Brigade’s 7th Regiment under Hou Kesheng, the 8th Regiment under Zhao Qianghua, and the 9th Regiment under Wang Jingjiu reached Su County. Yesterday the artillery battalion under Chen Ruihe, the engineer battalion under Qiu Qingquan, the transport battalion under Li Zhenhe, the cavalry company under Fang Dianwu, and the 10th Regiment under Bai Tianmin’s 6th Brigade continued their departure. Remaining in Bengbu are the 11th Regiment under Wang Zhonglian, the 12th Regiment under Li Jingnan, the brigade headquarters, division staff, quartermaster, military justice, medical, and special service units under Li Yuan. At 10:00 a.m. today, Staff Officer Zou led these into Su County, while each unit left a small guard detachment in Bengbu. Second Route Commander Liu Zhi, needing to inspect defenses in Xuzhou for his units along the Tianjin–Pukou and Longhai lines, traveled from Hankou by steamer to the capital, then at 4:00 a.m. this morning arrived in Bengbu by special train. At the station he was welcomed by Cavalry 2nd Division Commander Zhang Lisheng, 2nd Division 6th Brigade Commander Bai Tianmin, City Public Security Bureau Director Lu Xu, Changhu Waterborne Public Security Director Zhou Qixian, and the military police band. After brief exchanges he boarded his train northward.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, by order the 3rd Army’s 7th Division under Wang Jun, newly stationed at Luohe and then assigned to defend Bengbu, upon reaching Hankou was embarked in batches to Pukou. Today at 2:00 p.m., the 41st Regiment under Li Wenbin’s 21st Brigade arrived in Bengbu by rail; upon disembarking they moved into barracks. The 42nd Regiment under Chen Xueshun is scheduled to arrive tomorrow. The 19th Brigade under Zeng Wanzhong, the 20th Brigade under Zhu Gaoru, and directly attached troops will follow in succession. The 44th Division under Yang Shengzhi also departed from Hankou and is en route; it too will reach Bengbu within days. (February 18)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Provincial Capital of Jiangsu Promotes Domestic Goods Movement <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Propaganda Committee, noting the recent surge in gold prices and plunge in silver prices, saw a prime opportunity to encourage compatriots to purchase domestic goods and refuse foreign wares. Accordingly, it designated the period from the 17th to the 22nd of this month as Domestic Goods Movement Propaganda Week, and appointed delegations to travel to Shanghai to liaise with the Shanghai Domestic Goods Promotion Association, requesting that they send representatives with samples to exhibit at local markets to stimulate public enthusiasm for domestic products. Details of activities are as follows:</p>
<p>Speeches by Distinguished Figures</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00, the Propaganda Committee invited Zhang Daofan, Ye Xiufeng, Zhu Jianbai, Niu Yongjian, He Yushu, Miao Bin, and others to deliver public speeches at the Park Public Lecture Hall. Representatives from the Police Academy, the District Training Institute, and the Provincial Industry and Commerce Rectification Committee were on hand to receive and host the speakers.</p>
<p>Open-Air Speeches</p>
<p>The Zhenjiang County Party Branch was appointed as the lead department for open-air speeches. In recent days teams from each district party branch conducted speeches according to the prescribed schedule and topics outlined in the propaganda guidelines, delivering passionate addresses.</p>
<p>Domestic Goods Exhibit</p>
<p>At the request of the provincial committee, the Shanghai Domestic Goods Promotion Association dispatched representatives with samples to Jiangsu. Exhibits are on display at the All-Zhejiang Association in Zhenjiang for public viewing. Additional domestic goods are expected to arrive soon; due to space constraints the Association is seeking alternative venues and plans to sell samples at minimal prices.</p>
<p>Movement Assembly</p>
<p>The Propaganda Committee decided to hold a Domestic Goods Movement Assembly at 9:00 on the 22nd at the Public Stadium. All government bodies, organizations, schools, and the public have been invited to participate. Zhang Daofan, Ye Xiufeng, Zhu Jianbai, Niu Yongjian, Miao Bin, Chen Sibai, and Shi Liang have been appointed to the assembly presidium.</p>
<p>Recreation Gala</p>

<h3 id="e74">Cheng Tianfang Departs for Beijing to Resign as Acting Chairman <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Anqing dispatch—Following the resignation of Wang Jinyu as Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, rumors circulated that Ma Fuxiang would succeed him, but this did not come to pass. A recent central decree appointed Education Department Director Cheng Tianfang to concurrently serve as Civil Affairs Department Director and Acting Provincial Chairman. On the 15th Cheng received the telegram, stating that due to the political turbulence in Anhui, the chairmanship would be fraught with conflict and difficult to assume; that same evening he departed by steamer for Beijing to tender his resignation to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for both the acting chairmanship and the civil affairs directorship. Whether his request will be approved remains uncertain. Meanwhile, the original Acting Chairman and Civil Affairs Director, Wu Xingya, having been reassigned by the center as Civil Affairs Director of Hubei, received repeated summons from Hubei Chairman He Chengjun to assume his new post. He repeatedly urged the center to promptly announce a new chairman. Although Cheng Tianfang was temporarily appointed Acting Chairman, he has already departed for Beijing to resign, and Wu is eager to depart. Accordingly, arrangements were made to both urge Cheng to accept the post promptly and to instruct subordinates to accelerate handover procedures. Yesterday (the 16th), despite it being a weekly holiday, Wu convened the secretariat, the Civil Affairs Department, and the section heads of the Self-Government Preparatory Office in the provincial government to hold a closing meeting. It was decided that from today (the 17th) onward the handover process would commence. (February 17)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Fan Xiji Departs for Jining to Inspect Defense <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Jinan dispatch—In recent days many rumors have circulated in the Caozhou area. County magistrates from various counties under Caozhou have come to Jinan to report to the provincial government. Provincial Chairman Chen Diaoyuan, noting that Jining alone has sufficient garrison to control Caozhou—where heavy troops are already stationed—dispatches 26th Army Commander and 46th Division Commander Fan Xiji to Jining to inspect defense affairs and to confer with 55th Division Commander Ruan Zhaochang stationed in Yanzhou. Fan departed this morning (the 17th) at 10:00 a.m. by special train southbound. Chief of Staff Li Erkang, Adjutant Director Bai Yushan, and all brigade and regiment commanders saw him off at the station. At the station Fan remarked that this trip to Jining is to review the troops and inspect defenses; he will return to Jinan tomorrow. The majority of provincial troops stationed in Jining suffice to secure the province’s southwestern defenses, so no troops are garrisoned in Caozhou. He then departed south. (February 17)</p>

<h3 id="e77">Significant Discoveries of Ancient Relics at the Yin Ruins <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Earliest Sculpture … Polychrome Glazed Pottery</p>
<p>Bronze Molds and Vessels … Qilin Skull</p>
<p>Dr. Li Ji, Director of the National Institute of History and Philology in Beiping, a Harvard graduate and member of the Smithsonian Institution, has recently conducted scientific excavations in Anyang County, Henan, uncovering a rich array of Shang dynasty artifacts of considerable importance. The following article, penned by Mr. Edward Hunter, principal writer for the Peking English Guide based on Dr. Li’s remarks, is translated here for readers:</p>
<p>“Recent discoveries in Henan are of such value that several pages of China’s art, culture, and social history must be rewritten. The major finds are summarized below:</p>
<p>1. The discovery of China’s oldest sculpture, approximately 1,500 years earlier than previously estimated.</p>
<p>2. The unearthing of Shang dynasty polychrome glazed pottery (dating to 1766–1122 B.C.), with manufacture predating the Shang by at least 1,000 years, conclusively proving the earlier invention of glazed ceramics.</p>
<p>3. The first-ever discovery of Shang dynasty bronze molds and white bronze vessels, confirming that bronze mold technology was already in use during the Shang.</p>
<p>These findings demonstrate that 3,000 years ago the Chinese had a penchant for antiquities akin to modern connoisseurs. In addition, several hundred inscribed tortoise shells and ox scapulae used for divination were found, and inscriptions on bone fragments confirm that the mythical Qilin once existed as a single‑horned beast of formidable nature.</p>
<p>Excavation took place in a small township of Anyang County, formerly under Zhangde Prefecture, site of the ancient Shang capital. Despite unrest in the Central Plains, work continued uninterrupted until recently, when bandit raids and local villagers’ disregard for Feng Shui temporarily halted operations. The ruins were first discovered in 1899 (Guangxu year 25), yielding several inscribed bones. Since then excavations have been sporadic, but most artifacts suffered damage due to the unscientific efforts of local farmers and antique dealers seeking a few bone fragments for sale to foreign museums. These inscriptions, over 4,000 years old, are China’s earliest script. Only in the past few years have detailed excavations been undertaken, and most major finds have emerged in the last several months. The principal artifacts are now housed at the Beihai History Research Institute. Detailed important discoveries follow:</p>
<p>(1) Sculpture: Discovered by Dr. Li Ji, the piece—broken into three sections but largely intact when reassembled—depicts a crouching human figure. Only the torso to lower legs survive. The figure stands several feet tall, the hands clasping the legs, with floral patterns carved on the arms in an ancient style. Its patina is characteristic of Shang craftsmanship, dating at least 3,200 years ago. This predates any known Chinese sculpture by 1,500 years and is unlike Babylonian or Egyptian works predating the Shang.</p>
<p>(2) Ceramics: One vessel is coated with a vitreous glaze—an extraordinary find. It is clearly not Shang in style, suggesting it may have been brought from elsewhere. Dr. Li speculates it belonged to an antiquities collector of the period, dating roughly 1,000 years before the Shang. The discovery site lies in a floodplain that was once part of the Yellow River’s course; geologists identify four major floods there. Early glaze technology of this age is significant, as glaze invention is generally attributed to the Han dynasty (from ca. 200 B.C.).</p>
<p>(3) Bronze Molds and White Bronze Vessels: An astonishing discovery. While some scholars had speculated the Shang used white bronze, this provides the first solid evidence. The bronze molds, invented in the Shang, and Shang jade artifacts were also found. Although the Zhou dynasty (1122–255 B.C.) introduced a new social order, its artistic traditions largely continued Shang practices.</p>
<p>(4) Tortoise Plastrons and Ox Scapulae: These bones exhibit small drill holes and charcoal traces, indicating their use in oracle bone divination. Last autumn’s finds also included bronze bowls, arrowheads, and spearheads—all Shang artifacts—alongside stone carvings resembling Zhou jade, suggesting Zhou artisans inherited Shang designs. Many carved stone balls and a finely crafted jade axe were recovered, as well as additional white jade objects from the Shang.</p>
<p>(5) Qilin: An animal skull bearing inscriptions unexpectedly confirmed that the Qilin once existed as a one‑horned beast. Marco Polo’s descriptions of the Qilin align with these findings, lending credence to his accounts.”</p>

<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>The Songjiang Chinese Medical Association held its re‑election earlier in January, producing seven executive committee members: Zhu Wenqing, Jiang Anren, Zha Gongfu, Yang Yunquan, Zhou Chungku, Han Fengjiu, and Nie Yufang. On the fifteenth of this month, they met again to elect the standing committee from among themselves, resulting in Jiang Anren’s selection. At an extraordinary meeting yesterday, they formally assumed their duties.</p>
<p>In the Zhoujia Grass area just outside the county’s North Gate near Longxing Bridge, some people from north of the river have been dismantling tomb enclosures and excavating graves. The other day, they uncovered a tomb and found several stone slabs engraved with inscriptions. After local scholars washed and rubbed them clean, they realized it was the Song Dynasty tomb of Zhou Tong; these slabs form his tomb epitaph. Locals immediately halted the excavation, and the slabs are now being prepared for preservation. According to records, Zhou Tong was the teacher of General Yue Fei, and the book “Yue’s Biography” contains many accounts of his deeds.</p>
<p>The Civil Affairs Department has dispatched Commissioner Huang Chao (a native of Chuxiong, Zhejiang) to Songjiang. He arrived today, immediately called on County Magistrate Jin, and met with local commerce leaders, who indicated they are still conducting a covert inquiry into the case of Wu Qinian’s disruption of the marketplace.</p>
<p>Qingpu</p>
<p>Grandmother Despairs After Granddaughter’s Disappearance. Behind the Bieyoutian Teahouse on Matou Street resides Ms. Jiang Zhu, over sixty years old. She has one son whose wife, Ms. Wang, bore a single daughter, now seventeen, named A‑Xiu. Last autumn, a matchmaker arranged for A‑Xiu to become a son‑in‑law (through purchase) to Ji Bosheng of Nanxiang, who works as a partner in a local distillery. Upon entering the family, he took the name Jiang Baisun. The couple became fond of each other and pressed for an early wedding, but A‑Xiu’s family lacked funds and deferred the marriage for three years or until Ji secured 300 yuan abroad. Impatient and penniless, Ji assaulted his fiancée and fled to Nanxiang. Since A‑Xiu’s disappearance, Ms. Jiang has hired searchers to no avail, weeping day and night. At dusk the other day, she attempted suicide but was discovered by her son and rescued before losing her life.</p>
<p>Bandits Raid Zhou De’s Farmhouse. In Chenqiaojiang Village, Qingpu County, farming couple Zhou De and his wife were attacked around noon yesterday by a large group of bandits who forced open their door. When asked, “Where is your rifle?” they replied they had sold it; asked “Where is your son?” they feigned ignorance. The bandits bound the couple to the bed, covered their faces with bedclothes, and then spoke in a local accent, revealing themselves as villagers. After killing them, they drank at the scene until three o’clock, then escaped southward. They stole 154 silver dollars, over eighty bolts of small cloth, and numerous pieces of jewelry and clothing.</p>

<p>Rewards and Punishments in the Eastern Office Jailbreak Case. The county prison under the Eastern Office holds over two hundred inmates, including court‑held prisoners. On February 5, the chief suspects in the Communist bandits’ murder of former township head Zhang Peilin took advantage of guards shouting and drinking to tunnel through the rear wall and slither out. More than ten attempted flight north toward Nanhui but were spotted at the North Gate by police sentry Zang Xuezhi. He arrested them on the spot and delivered them safely to headquarters. Prefect Hong has officially commended Squad Leader Jin Zhenzhong and promoted Patrol Officer Zang to acting sergeant. Prison warden Lu, blamed for lax security and failure to investigate, has been dismissed pending High Court discipline. Duty guards have also been referred for prosecution, and the escapees, including Gu Futang, have been ordered by the High Court to be executed.</p>
<p>Exposure of a Communist Cell. In the Fourth District’s Jinjia Qigan area, Zhang Sandì—former cadre of the banned Communist branch “Dawn Light Middle School”—frequently met with teacher Liu Qinzai and held clandestine meetings at his home. County Police Captain Ding Zhiyan, with Squad Leader Tu Qinfang and others, arrested Zhang Sandì and his son, along with comrades Kang Musheng and Zhu Guijiang. All four confessed to Communist activity with Liu. The county has placed Liu Qinzai on the provincial wanted list, and the four suspects will be sent to the High Court for trial.</p>
<p>Jiading</p>
<p>Refugees Arrested Across the Border Injured. Fifteen members of Chen Ayou’s party from Luoyang Township—arrested by Shanghai Special Municipal Public Security Bureau, District 3, across the border—were returned to the county. On the afternoon of the eighteenth, Presiding Magistrate Zhang held a hearing. They all testified that Luoyang Village is far from the incident site; that at night they heard gongs, police broke in, dragged them from their beds, and beat them along the way and at the station. Qian Fangchu immediately vomited blood; Qian Nairong and others were injured and feverish. Medical examinations showed wounds of varying severity; the six most serious, including Qian Fangchu, were sent to Sun Yat‑sen Hospital, while the other nine remain detained awaiting further medical inspection.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Armed Robbery at Qiantai Cheng Lumber Store Outside Xumen Gate. At No. 47 Zaoshi Street, Qiantai Cheng’s wood shop was thriving. Around 8:30 pm on the nineteenth, just after dinner, two bandits burst in—one in a long satin robe and velvet cap carrying a flashlight, the other in a short jacket with a pistol. They barred the door, forced partners and apprentices into one room, then pried open the cash chest, stealing 435 yuan in bills, 161 yuan in counterfeit notes, 335 silver dollars, and 5.4 yuan in small silver. Partner Wang Xi’an hid and slipped out to alert the Seventh Precinct. Inspector Wang notified the Min Police Department and led a two‑pronged pursuit. The robbers fled west, dividing the loot en route, crossed Zaoshi Bridge, and turned east, encountering the Rapid Response Team. At Taixing Bridge, the robber in the long robe evaded capture, eluding officers even before the Seventh Precinct. Inspector Wang chased him to Dahrigh Bridge, where the robber discarded his pistol into the river and hid in a nearby thatch hut. Sergeant Liu Jun’s flashlight revealed one shoe, leading to the robber’s capture. On him were recovered 313 yuan in genuine notes, all 161 yuan in counterfeit, 13 silver dollars, a cigarette case, a gold watch chain (about six qian), a watch, and a three‑inch bronze Buddha—verified by Qiantai Cheng’s partners as stolen goods. Detective Captain Zhou Hongjiang and precinct sergeants then brought the robber to the district office. Commissioner Zhang’s interrogation yielded no confession until further questioning by Captain Zhou, when he admitted the robbery and implicated another accomplice surnamed Jia at the Tongrenchang factory. Officers escorted the robber back to the district office overnight and were dispatched to arrest the fugitive, but so far without success. The suspect was returned to the station at 9 am yesterday for processing. Meanwhile, Inspector Wang also arrested three suspects—Gao Jinju, Zhao Youbi, and Zhu Hongfu—at a thatch shelter south of the Xumen Gate Taixiang Bridge, seizing a coded slip, a passport, and promissory notes; they were sent to the district office for related questioning.</p>
<p>Another Batch of Refugees Arrives in Suzhou. Yesterday (20th) at 9 am, over one hundred refugees from Pizhou County, sent from the Wujiang area, arrived in Suzhou. The precinct reported to the commissioner, and Director Zou of the Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched officers to facilitate their onward departure.</p>
<p>Military Servants Collude in Theft and Escape. Paymaster Qian Dajun of the Wuchang Military Officer School recently cashed his salary of 2,600 yuan. His servants Si Huagui and Huang Rong colluded to steal the money and abscond. Si Huagui was captured by Hankou Special Police agents. Huang Rong, residing at No. 18 Shipihe Lane in Suzhou, was named by Qian in a telegram to the Suzhou Public Security Bureau. Director Zou ordered the detective squad yesterday (20th) to arrest Huang’s brother, Huang Daxing, and bring him in for questioning.</p>
<p>Charitable Donations Used to Launch Initiatives. In Wu County, following charitable donations, the county was ordered to allocate funds to education. Yesterday (20th), the Education Bureau sent a letter requesting the county government to issue registration forms for temples as a reference to proceed with the programs.</p>
<p>Temporary Suspension of Posthumous Bone Cleansing for Ms. Han. In Wu County Local Court, regarding the exhumation and bone‑boiling in the case of Ms. Han—whose body has not yet decomposed—and given that her stomach and intestines have been sent to Shanghai for toxicological examination, the court has decided to suspend the bone‑cleansing process for now.</p>

<p>Suspected Fence Voluntarily Surrenders. In the administrative jurisdiction’s Huai Shi Market, at Mr. You Jisheng’s home in Chen Lane, thieves Ma Fushou, Qian Ada, and two others were captured last winter by Political‑Public Security Officer Tang Yushun. They confessed to the theft and were each sentenced to life imprisonment. Recently, You Jisheng’s nephew, You Genrong, reported to the Seventh District office that on the 13th Tang Yushun and Chen Ada summoned him to the home of local protector Qian Xubao and extorted 300 yuan, later reduced to 60 yuan to be paid within 20 days. District Chief Zhao immediately reported the matter to the county government. The county summoned You Genrong, Tang Yushun, Chen Ada, and Qian Xubao for questioning. At yesterday’s hearing, You Genrong reiterated his claim. Tang Yushun contended that Genrong had masterminded the original theft, recruiting Ma Fushou and Qian Ada to seize the 3,000 yuan hidden under the floorboards, and fearing they would expose him, voluntarily gave them 50 yuan without coercion. Qian Xubao confirmed that Genrong sent 50 yuan afterward and warned them not to speak. After verification, the court ordered Genrong detained, while Tang Yushun and the others were released on bail pending further investigation.</p>
<p>River Transport Representatives from Jiangsu Petition in Beijing. Faced with the Ministry of Construction’s plan to levy a new inland‑river packet‑boat river‑management fee, the river transport guilds of Jiangsu counties held joint meetings and resolved to send representatives to petition the central ministries and provincial government. Although the Ministry of Communications initially approved withdrawing the plan, the provincial government—citing its prior Provincial Affairs Council decision and the urgent need to dredge waterways—reinstated the levy effective January 1. Local operators vehemently opposed this and resolved to dispatch representatives to the Executive Yuan. On the 19th, six delegates from Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Nantong, and Wujin arrived in Nanjing, assembled at the Nanjing River Transport Guild, and at 10 am presented their petition to Secretary‑General Liu Yongkai at the Executive Yuan. Liu acknowledged their hardships, said he would forward the petition to the Premier, and instruct the Ministry of Communications and the provincial government to handle it impartially. The delegates expressed satisfaction and departed.</p>
<p>Civil Affairs Department Section Chief Goes to Province. Qian Sunqing, chairman of the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce and of the River Transport Guild, was recently appointed by the Jiangsu provincial government as Section Chief of the First Section of the Civil Affairs Department. Qian is scheduled to arrive at the department on the 21st to assume his post.</p>

<p>Police Raid Gambling Den. On the afternoon of the 18th, under county magistrate’s orders, Police Captain Chen Gang of Wuyi led a 26‑officer team by boat to the Sanxing Teahouse at Qishuyan to crack down on gambling. Having been tipped off, the gambling suspects had already scattered. The owner Chen Bujin and partner Wu Shousheng were found packing up marked mahjong tiles, playing cards, dominoes, and gambling funds. Captain Chen seized these and arrested Wu Shousheng and others, delivering them to the county on the 19th for questioning.</p>

<p>Interrogation in the Hongxingsha Assassination Case. North of town at Hongxingsha, a man surnamed Tan was shot to death. Following autopsy, with the killer at large, County Police Chief Jin Chuyun was ordered to investigate. On the 18th, they arrested Yun Hongzhang of Yangjiaqiao, Jingjiang, suspected of involvement, and brought him in for questioning. Yun said he now works at a lace factory on Gordon Road in Shanghai and knew Tan from school. He had planned to return to Jingjiang on the 17th but learned aboard the boat at Jiangyin from Wang Yongcai of Yitai Clothing Store that Tan was dead, allegedly killed by Cai Yihua, and that Tan’s fiancée might be implicated. Witnesses including Tan’s parents, store partner Wang Yongcai, matchmaker Ji Dongshi, brother‑in‑law Bao Xingcai, mother‑in‑law Bao Shi, and fiancée Tan Bao all gave conflicting and bizarre accounts demanding justice. The court ordered Yun Hongzhang, Bao Xingcai, Bao Shi, and Ji Dongshi each held separately pending further investigation.</p>
<p>Uncertain Death of Fan Taoyuan. Within ten days, two homicides occurred in District Two at Wenqiao Town’s Dayuandi. Fan Taoyuan, married to Zhang Xiaomei but also involved with another woman, Zhang Wenbao, married the latter’s niece on the 14th day of the lunar New Year. Enraged, Zhang Xiaomei confronted him and had three acres of his land seized. Only then did Fan calm down. On the morning of the 18th, his body was found hanging from a small tree behind the back gate of Wang Ziting. Close examination showed a thick rope and blood on the knees, indicating the body had been moved postmortem. Wang Ziting reported this to the county for autopsy.</p>

<p>Villagers Petition to Stop Competition from Yao’s Boat Service. In Shunjiang Township, local merchants Wu Meiqiao, Wang Xiaobo, and others, running the Su–Datong river route, competed so fiercely that the Benniu steamer boiler exploded, causing unprecedented disaster. Realizing the danger, the companies briefly ceased operations—but soon Datong, Litong, and Yongda each launched services simultaneously, cutting fares and increasing speed to prove superiority. Fearing a repeat of the Benniu tragedy, yesterday the county wrote to the River Transport Guild urging humane regulation and an even distribution of daily departures to avoid risk.</p>
<p>Provincial Police Corps Reassigns Commanders. The Jiangsu Provincial Police Corps has reassigned its artillery police leadership: Captain Wang Xuehong of Artillery Police First Unit has been replaced by Second Lieutenant Inspector Ding Tingcan of the Second Unit.

After nightfall, bandits probed with flashlights. The vessel’s police disembarked, challenged the group in the darkness, and, receiving no password response, fired two warning shots. The bandits returned fire with box guns. The River Police lay prone and returned fire, exchanging shots for over ten minutes before routing the bandits.</p>

<p>Local Woman Attempts Suicide Over Broken Romance. Ms. Shi of Zhujiaqiao, Xiaoshan—formerly a student in Hangzhou—fell in love last year with Mr. Shen of Shaoxing. In January of this year, Shen suddenly married another woman. Upon hearing this, Ms. Shi attempted to drown herself in brine but was noticed by bystanders and sent to Hangzhou Daxing Hospital for treatment; her survival remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Shortfall in Education Funding to Be Supplemented. Xiaoshan’s education budget has long been insufficient. With the expansion of rural primary schools, higher primary schools, and vocational education, the new budget is short by several ten‑thousand yuan. The magistrate proposed that, effective this year, an additional four jiao per liang be levied—a proposal approved by the provincial finance departments.</p>

<p>In the case of fraud involving the May Thirtieth Massacre relief funds: the relief payments for the families of victims of the May Thirtieth Massacre, after years of negotiation by the Support Association, were only resolved at the end of last year. One of the townsmen who perished then was Shi Songs­heng; his mother was instructed by the Association at the end of the lunar year to travel to Shanghai to receive two thousand yuan in relief. Upon arriving and unfamiliar with the city, she applied to the Shangyu Association in Shanghai for assistance. The Association dispatched staff member Zhang Jieshou to accompany her. Under the Association’s name, a receipt was signed by Shi’s mother to collect the funds. However, Zhang immediately deducted 150 yuan for travel expenses, 200 yuan for entertainment, and over 1,600 yuan for other charges, leaving Shi Songs­heng’s mother with only 300 yuan. Swallowing her indignation, she returned to Shangyu. She now intends to sue Zhang for fraud in the county government and has sent a petition to the Shanghai District Court requesting his arrest, severe punishment, and restitution of the misappropriated funds.</p>
<p>A tragic episode of irresponsible romance: Xu Shangchuan, former board member of Donghai Primary School in Shangxu Village, Dongxiang, last spring, driven by rampant banditry, hid his young son in the school. The boy’s sleeping quarters were in the same room as teacher Shen Changyan. Since Shen routinely left early and returned late, this arrangement was taken for granted. The boy, barely toddling, needed help each morning dressing, a task performed by his sister Qiuj­u (aged fifteen and a student at the school). Before long, she was seduced by Changyan and became pregnant, her abdomen swelling over time. Fearing ridicule, she continued to wear a lined cheongsam in the bitter winter to conceal her condition. When the winter vacation ended, Changyan, fearing implication, made an excuse and silently fled, disappearing without a trace. On the night of the lunar calendar’s twelfth month, twenty‑eighth, Qiuj­u was seized by severe labor pains. Her parents and sister‑in‑law, enraged, refused to let her give birth at home and forced her outdoors to deliver in the open air amid heavy snowfall. She cried out in agony; nearby villagers covered their ears and dared not approach. She gave birth to a son, then collapsed. The newborn froze to death in the cold. Though villagers attempted to aid Qiuj­u, the ordeal was too great; she died the next morning. When this matter came to the attention of the education authorities, they were outraged and intend to issue a decree to all county schools that Shen Changyan shall never again be employed.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Central Academy Excavates the Yin Ruins at Anyang; National Government Orders Henan Province to Heighten Protection <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>(Central News) Yesterday, to ensure the protection of the Central Academy’s excavation work at the Yin ruins in Anyang, the National Government issued a special instruction to the Henan Provincial Government. According to a report by Cai Yuanpei, President of the National Central Academy, concerning the excavation methods for the Anyang Yin ruins, approval is requested for the proposed arrangements. The Henan Provincial Government is directed to pay close attention to safeguarding the Academy’s work.</p>
<p>Previously, the Academy had been excavating the ancient Yin Dynasty site in Anyang County, Henan, with the Province’s gracious consent for over a year, yielding significant results. However, in October of last year, He Richang, Director of the Henan Provincial Library, claimed under provincial orders the right to excavate, issuing notices banning other parties from excavation, causing the Academy’s work to be suspended. The Academy, focusing on scholarly rather than proprietary aims, sees no precedent for such conflict. Two years of preparation have secured needed experts and modern archaeological tools, attracting domestic and foreign scholars who regard the site as a new epoch in Chinese antiquarian studies. The Academy is confident it will not disturb stratigraphy or destroy historical remains and feels a strong sense of responsibility. On October 30 last year, it petitioned the National Government to oversee the work; the Chairman approved and ordered the Henan Provincial Government to resume protection of the Central Academy’s excavation, and to halt any unauthorized activities by He Richang. Concurrently, the Academy dispatched its Institute of History and Philology Director, Chuan Si, to negotiate in person, emphasizing sincere consultation. Thanks to the Chairman’s oversight and in the spirit of harmony between central academic bodies and local authorities for the advancement of scholarship, Chuan Si won the sympathy of local dignitaries. After five weeks, on December 28, the Henan Provincial Government issued five measures for resolution, hereby submitted for your review. If approved by Your Excellency, we respectfully request authorization and formation of the record, and that the Henan Provincial Government be notified.</p>

<p>Mr. Yan Yuye’s Guangyu Company—including its public ironworks and textile mill departments—recently donated 500 yuan to Mr. X. Upon his polite refusal, the donation was redirected to the China Vocational School, to establish a loan‑fund for students in engineering disciplines from impoverished but talented families, encouraging them to diligently practice mechanical work and become useful talent.</p>

<p>Zhengfeng Literary Institute, located at 345 Jing’an Temple Road, has been operating for over two years as a specialized academy for classical Chinese studies. This term it has added eminent literature professors such as Hu Puan, Yao Minghui, Zhu Xiangwan, Zhang Yanchang, Qi Fanniu, and Bao Dujiu. Enrollment has surged. Last year the Institute secured nine acres of vacant land at the end of North Sichuan Road near Gaotalu Road. Terms have been agreed, and new campus construction will commence this year, with completion expected by the autumn term. The currently rented premises will serve only as temporary classrooms. Plans for formal registration will be submitted to the Ministry once construction is completed.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Funds for Participation in the Far Eastern Championship: Chairman Chiang Instructs the Executive Yuan to Handle <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Ninth Far Eastern Championship Games are scheduled for May 24 to 31 in Tokyo, Japan. Both the Japanese and Philippine governments have allocated substantial funds, making significant preparations to secure victory and international prestige. Our country, however, currently has no funding sources for participation. The governing body, the All‑China Sports Promotion Association, previously resolved at a board meeting that the standard requirement is eighty thousand yuan, of which forty thousand yuan shall be raised by the Association and forty thousand yuan requested from the National Government, to bolster morale. We also request that the Government appoint a representative to attend the Games. The Association has received a reply from the Government’s Secretariat indicating that Chairman Chiang has instructed the Executive Yuan to handle the matter. The original official letter reads: “To the All‑China Sports Promotion Association: Your request for Government subsidy of forty thousand yuan for participation in the Ninth Far Eastern Championship Games in Tokyo from May 24 and for the dispatch of Government representatives has been referred to the Executive Yuan for approval.” Considering that when the Games were held in our country, the Japanese and Philippine governments each contributed one hundred thousand yuan and even dispatched warships as escorts, demonstrating meticulous attention to international sports, our request of only forty thousand yuan is modest. The Government is expected to grant our application to enable our delegation to proceed.</p>

<p>For the Shanghai Special Municipality’s citywide sports meet, in addition to soliciting prizes from all sectors, a specially designed medal has been created featuring an eagle clutching a cup in its beak, symbolizing heroic victory. This model was produced by sculptor Mr. Brans, introduced to Shanghai by expatriate artist Mr. Philip, who came from Belgium. Brans is one of the foremost figures in modern art; he once crafted portraits of the Belgian crown prince’s newly married couple and received a special honor. While in Shanghai, he is staying at the Bund’s Sassoon House and will soon depart for Japan. Keen to leave a work in China as a memento, he thus created this unique medal for the sports meet, sure to invigorate the athletes’ spirits.</p>

<p>Ten Matches, Ten Victories</p>
<p>Fudan University Experimental High School’s basketball team, possessing formidable strength, once led all Shanghai secondary schools in basketball in 1929. Their agility in play and rapid passing have long been praised by Shanghai residents. This time, tasked with fundraising publicity for the school and with the aim of strengthening ties with top South China teams, the squad departed on the morning of January 11 aboard the Russian ship Queen of Russia and returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong on February 9. They stopped in Guangzhou for ten days, playing four matches, and in Hong Kong for ten days, playing six matches. In total they played ten matches against powerful opponents, winning every game. They have now returned to Shanghai with outstanding results. Match scores are as follows:</p>

<p>Far Eastern Games Bound, Decided to Return to Compete</p>
<p>Lin, Wang, and Su Also Plan to Return to China</p>
<p>Tennis stars Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai have been preparing in Hong Kong to travel to the Philippines for the Carnival tennis tournament, set to begin on February 12. They decided to depart Hong Kong on February 1. Recently it was reported that Japanese Davis Cup representatives Harada and Sato will pass through Hong Kong on February 7. A local sports figure visited Lin and Qiu to ask if they intended to stay in Hong Kong to challenge Harada, but they replied that since the Far Eastern Games are approaching and their ship tickets are already booked, they must leave as scheduled. Reporters visiting their residence first asked whether they would compete in both singles and doubles at the Carnival, and whether they had decided to return to represent China at the Ninth Far Eastern Championship Games. Both answered yes, vowing to work together to defend China’s Far Eastern championship title. When asked if Lin Wang and Su would also return, they said they intend to; Singapore is actively preparing to send teams to the National Games, and even if the football team cannot go, at least several swimmers will return to contest titles. Overseas Chinese sports enthusiasts show such patriotism that China’s performance at the Far Eastern Games may well surpass that of the previous event.</p>

<p>Wife: “My love, I’ve just found a letter you sent me before we were married. It has a line that says, ‘Even if a gentle breeze brushes against your face, I shall be jealous, because it has caressed your lovely cheeks.’ How sweet that is.”</p>
<p>Husband: “Oh? That’s because every time I come see you you open the window wide, and I can’t stand the cold breeze—so I wrote that.”</p>

<h3 id="e107">Anecdotes of Cao Zhuochao <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Cao Zhuochao, given name Jiada, style name Yingfu, was a native of Jiangyin. By nature he was indolent and unskilled at household management or production. Reading Wang Wenduan’s poetry, he could not believe the line that cuckoos are inept at building nests much like their speech, sighed, “These words fit me,” and adopted “Zhuochao” as his pseudonym. In youth he studied with Wu Maocai at Menggeng You and began writing poetry, though with little distinction. After enrolling in the academy, he studied under Chen Zifu for twelve years, diligently preparing for the imperial examinations. When Qin Shaoling served as prefectural instructor of Jiading, he praised Cao’s talent and discussed classics and histories with him day and night, finally revealing Cao’s promise. In the renyin year Cao was recommended as Filial and Incorrupt and reported to Shaoling, who said, “With your talent and learning, I knew you would be chosen, yet your outspoken nature often breaks taboos—what can be done?” Soon Shaoling left Jiangyin and Cao waited in vain. Later appointed magistrate in Shandong, Cao found no fit and returned home, just as national upheaval began.</p>
<p>Cao was thin and unkempt, his garments and sleeves stained with ink. Honest to a fault, he would not conceal anyone’s error even before a crowded hall; some resented him but none dared act. With classmates Chu Huachou, Zhang Xiongbo, Jiang Zhuzhuang, Jin Songcen, Ding Zhonghu, and others, all nicknamed him “Cao the Simple.” Expert in all studies, he excelled especially in poetry. After the turmoil, he let his hair grow long and did not shave, lodging in Yunjian and teaching to support himself, never speaking of worldly affairs. With no food stored for the night, he would still chant amid wind and rain, his voice resonant as metal and stone, delighting in nature’s inspiration. Skilled in short lyrics, his clarity approached that of the Daoist Bai. In the winter of guihai, when the author and Cao walked west of the city to observe ancient trees and lone crows, upon their return Cao filled an entire “A River Red” lyric by lamplight. The author had completed his first draft, which included the line, “Near dusk, the remnant sunlight threads through like tattered silk,” adding a sobbing note. Cao said, “That makes me put down my pen,” and never finished the piece.</p>
<p>Cao also excelled in ink‑plum paintings: petals fragrant as winter’s heart, branches slender and elegant, delicate and graceful. Sometimes three years passed without a work; other times he painted dozens in a single day. None could fathom his depths. Normally he disliked wine, yet a little banana‑leaf brew soon made him tipsy. When drunk he danced and sang Kunqu. At his seat, arrangements of tile jars and glass bottles formed a constellation; he plucked cassia blossoms and pickled lemons and roses, concocting every taste from pungent to sweet to sour. To guests he’d say, “This is my Guanfusi wine; this is Boshi’s wine,” and pour, “This is what I fancy,” for his friend loved pungency, he loved sweetness, and Cao himself delighted in sour. He adored flowers, planting them in every crack of his small courtyard. He often led his Guanfusi friend to the countryside to gather wild chrysanthemums among ancient graves, calling it pleasure. He also hunted edible greens with a small knife and wicker basket, crawling along muddy paths without care for stains. His wild abandon was unlike ordinary folk. Though many acquaintances were eminent, he never sought them. When teased, he’d frown, “Had I bent my integrity even a little, I’d hold high office long ago. Why remain in squalor? Better to starve in a ditch; I am pleased to wake with dew and sleep under stars.”</p>
<p>He exchanged verses with Wu Changshuo and Junqing; it was said no one understood Cao’s depths more than Guanfusi Boshi.</p>

<p>• Getting up early to eat noodles at a noodle shop is the best deal, because morning servings are more generous at any time. After nine o’clock, portions shrink considerably. Don’t believe it? Try it once.</p>
<p>• On a rainy day, when a car splashes mud as it passes, hold your umbrella handle sideways and tilt the canopy to block the spray—then the mud will strike the umbrella instead.</p>
<p>• When asking friends outside town to send you a money order via the post office, have them specify the nearest branch on the order—e.g. “___ Road Post Office.” Collecting it then becomes much more convenient. Otherwise, whether nearby or far, you must always go to the main post office, which is a great hassle.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Interesting Notes on Mahjong <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Ye</p>
<p>Mahjong has become a national pastime. In cities, everyone plays; even illiterate villagers know how to “zhong‑fa‑dong‑xi.” The other day I discussed mahjong with a friend and noted some amusing stories; here are a couple.</p>
<p>In a certain part of Pudong, the “Two of Myriads” tile is commonly called “Minhua.” The story goes that at the end of the Qing, a man named Minrong was extremely poor until he unexpectedly discovered twenty thousand in a buried cache, instantly becoming wealthy. With his riches but no status, he felt like a man wearing brocade in the dark. He then spent eight thousand over six months to build a grand mansion, earning villagers’ envy. Still lacking rank, he donated a huge sum to secure an official post, hung banners at his gate, and lived richly with servants galore. But fortunes reversed with the Wuchang Uprising: his donations were confiscated, his rank was lost, and after years of waste his money ran out—he was once again poor and lowly. Those now thirty have all witnessed this, so spending twenty thousand was once so easy for him that players call the “Two of Myriads” tile “Minhua.” Everyone knows “Minrong” means twenty thousand. Alas, Minrong’s story remains a grand tale.</p>
<p>Years ago at the Jiangsu Provincial Second Normal School, a beautiful English teacher once told her students in class, “Your country’s mahjong has its organization and variety; I enjoy it greatly. Do many of you excel at it?” The students replied, “Mahjong is a game of the lower classes; the educated disdain it.” She retorted, “I don’t believe that. I often see your high officials, wealthy magnates, teachers, and students all enjoy it. Are they all from the lower classes? Then your entire people must be lowly.” Her remark silenced them.</p>
<p>In a tea house in Dongting Town, Wuxi, a mahjong league chanted a verse:</p>
<p>“After one hand’s done, with chow, pung, and kong align</p>
<p>Three Dragons hit—just draw the last tile divine</p>
<p>Before eight rounds end, losing the meld yields one pure suit</p>
<p>Then on the Kong you draw Blossom—what a loot!”</p>
<p>Mahjong enthusiasts hearing this must itch to join in.</p>
<p>A certain county magistrate rigorously banned gambling, earning widespread praise. One night he traveled to Beijing, and friends arranged a late mahjong session for him. Suddenly police burst in and arrested everyone. The magistrate hastily gave a false name, claiming to be a merchant. Because their attire was fine, the police fined them a hundred gold taels. The magistrate paid and was released. People joked that the man who once fined others for gambling was now arrested and fined himself—what goes around comes around.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Record of the New Dormitory at Jiaotong University <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Zheng</p>
<p>At Shanghai West Jiaotong University, since the tenures of Presidents Sun and Li, school affairs have advanced considerably. Last year the administration, seeing student housing inadequate, commenced a new dormitory. After six months of work, it was completed this spring. Its exquisite facilities and distinctive architecture merit description.</p>
<p>The new dormitory sits behind the gymnasium, on land acquired under President Ling Zhuoming. The U‑shaped, three‑story building contains over one hundred rooms. On the ground floor are two large halls: one a reading room with an extensive collection of books and newspapers, the other a common room for gatherings, both tastefully arranged. Two students share each room, which includes a Western‑style wooden wardrobe and, in the left corner, a full‑height mirror for dressing. Matching desks, chairs, and bookshelves—purchased from XinXin Company—accompany new‑style spring‑mattress beds that are both soft and firm. The walls are painted light yellow, the ceilings white. Each room features a large window, providing excellent air and light. Students eagerly moved in and vied to decorate: some hung colored paintings, others calligraphy screens, blending Chinese and Western artistic elements. The washrooms have both hot and cold water piping, and the toilets are modeled after European style—standing inside feels like entering a grand hotel. Among domestic universities, this dormitory likely ranks first. In front, a broad avenue circles the building and leads directly off campus, though paving is not yet complete. Outside the dorm is a plaza bordered by cypress groves—air quality is superb and rarely matched. We hear that during the spring break the school will hold an official opening ceremony and invite the public to visit, which promises to be a grand occasion.</p>
<h3 id="e111">More Notes on Being Afraid of One’s Wife <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Qi</p>
<p>I recently read Ms. Lanxiu’s notes on “fear of one’s wife” in this column. Although a minor issue, it holds research value and a certain mystery. I will also discuss it here.</p>
<p>Many believe that, by principles of gender equality, a husband should not fear his wife—if she becomes unreasonable, he can handle her. This view is wrong. The fear arises from love; it differs entirely from fearing parents or teachers. Because of love, one indulges everything, accepting all her words and demands, whether right or wrong, reaching the point of genuine fear.</p>
<p>Others say it matters not: women are narrow‑minded and earnest. If their wishes are thwarted, they cry and disturb household harmony; if illness follows, the loss is greater. Better to yield. This view has merit, yet its root remains love.</p>
<p>Friends newly married or engaged say that fearing one’s wife is a delightful comedy. Imagine your beloved demands something—no matter how unreasonable—her expression enchants you. If you refuse, she pouts and cries, and you will, in pain, relent. Though near farce, it has true flavor. Such fear is surely an expression of love.</p>
<p>From these points we conclude that any man who fears his wife must love her deeply. I hope everyone fears their wife.</p>
<p>As for results: some men chafe under strict domestic rules and find it burdensome. But I believe a man who fears his wife has fewer chances to sin, spends less money, preserves his morals, and improves his temper. Don’t believe me? Consider American novelist Washington Irving’s famous line: “Men who are courteous and kind to everyone outside the home have surely endured a shrew at home.” Isn’t it so?</p>
<h3 id="e112">Heartfelt Warmth (No. 133) <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>In the ninth installment, famed scholars play hide‑and‑seek, and a fair maiden freely offers embraces.</p>
<p>Moreover, this not only unsettles women’s psychology but contradicts the public’s expectations. From grand political matters to trifles, we always yearn for fresh novelties. Women’s fashions also change continually: clothes made in the first half of the year often fall out of favor by the second, sometimes beyond alteration, forcing a return to ancient styles. Now the eldest aunt opens a trunk full of garments left by elder sister Ruiyun—some look as if just cut and sewn, yet in both style and pattern they belong to a bygone era. Poor clothes—like a person who has never stepped into the limelight, already outdated. The aunt tried to coax Ruiyun into wearing them, praising their cost. Ruiyun knew it true but, performing daily onstage, felt embarrassed seeing others in colorful costumes while she wore antiques. At fifteen, keen to outshine others, she naturally grew gloomy. Eventually Ajin said, “Today so many girls perform onstage. You need a few good outfits. That style isn’t in fashion now.” The aunt had no choice but to agree: “Tomorrow Ajin will take you to the old tailors on Laojiefu Street for fittings.” Now as a young master, one must yield—better to secure top clothing for the future. Ajin accompanied her, fitting a new suit, but the aunt instructed, “Only make the outer robe. Inside, whether leather, cotton, or padded, simply cover the new suit with the outer robe—no matter what old garments underneath.” Some joked of Ruiyun: “Gold on the outside, rotten cotton within.” Yet the cotton was not rotten—like a circle of scholars with archaic minds who adopted a veneer of modern learning and scorn all else. That suit became her staple for autumn, winter, and spring—people teased, “That’s a three‑season suit, just not for summer.” Ruiyun wept many times; at home in a patched old coat, she leaped about delighted. Never before had she cried for lack of clothes, yet now, because her garments were slightly unfashionable, she wept bitterly. This shows times and environments change, life must adapt. Ruiyun, a naturally carefree girl, one moment cried, the next laughed and played.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Financial Market: Interest Rates Turning Around, Liquidity as Before <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview</p>
<p>Yesterday’s foreign‑currency interest market was brisk, with banks actively buying and money exchanges and peers engaging in mutual supply and demand. The momentum was strong, and the morning session’s conditions were not weaker than the usual two sessions combined. This indicates that market sentiment now carries hopes of a turnaround. Accordingly, interest rates rose with the trend; though not skyrocketing, they climb step by step daily—a positive sign for the market’s prospects. As for liquidity, with ample upfront reserves but persistent mismatches in supply and demand, improvement remains difficult.</p>
<p>Interest‑Rate Swaps</p>
<p>In the morning, due to very active foreign‑exchange transactions, swap rates rose to 0.719625%. Compared with the previous day’s increase of 0.0625%, they have risen by over one percentage point between the two markets. Interbank silver and account transfers remain conducted on white‑letter credit; no “water” charges or bank quotations were in evidence.</p>
<p>Sub‑Coin Market</p>
<p>Jiangnan small silver coins rose by 1 point from the previous day to 6.275%, with trading volume of 3,500 taels. Guangdong small silver coins also gained 1 point to 5.97%, with 85,000 taels traded. At midday, trading had not yet begun, so no market price was available. In the copper coin bulk market, prices rose by 500 cash to 402,500 cash per string, with trading exceeding 31,000 strings.</p>
<p>Foreign‑Currency Inflows and Outflows (Silver Drafts)</p>
<p>Banking Sector: Yesterday’s market was slightly busier. Chinese merchants collected drafts totaling over 1.70 million taels, foreign merchants 1.56 million, and Japanese merchants over 4 million. Various trade remittances, miscellaneous fees, telegraphic advances, and other items totaled over 10 million. Outflows included 800,000 taels by Chinese merchants, 500,000 by foreign merchants, and 300,000 by Japanese merchants into vaults. Qianzhuang and silver‑trading firms collected over 28 million in draft receipts (being pre‑due), telegraphic drafts collected over 3.5 million, other remittances over 700,000, and cash receipts were weak at 1 million.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Gold Price Exceeds Ninety Taels <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Efforts to cover short positions and reverse long positions converged, and on the 20th the standard gold price rose with increasing fervor. Market sentiment reached optimism, and prices moved beyond the 490-tael mark for foreign transactions—likely because buying outpaced selling. Exchange drafts also tightened. Traders scrambled to settle accounts; confidence remained high. Firms such as Hengxing, Yuda, Yuanmaoyong, Fuxingyong, Jin’an, and others had already purchased, while some covered shorts and reversed long positions. Sellers including Fuchang, Yuanheng, Zhifengyong, and others liquidated holdings. Prices fluctuated unpredictably, with daily swings totaling over four taels. In the early session, large-unit quotes narrowed, immediately rising by over two taels, but then oscillated within two taels. By midday the market had reached a peak, briefly surpassing ninety-two taels. Exchange bills strengthened further; the current London gold settlement stood at only one shilling eleven and five‑eighth pence, and Japanese gold required 102.5 fen per tael. Later, the price leaped to ninety-three taels as buyers grew active. When exchange liquidity eased, it fell two taels, then recovered by more than one tael to ninety‑one taels and sixty‑seven cents. London silver bars recently contracted by 1.25 for spot and 1.875 for forward, while silver prices dropped three‑eighths and exchange rates eased slightly.</p>
<p>Open trades leapt, with the April gold contract opening stronger by two taels at 490 taels and 4 cents. Unsettled positions fell from 90 taels and 9 cents to 88 taels and 6 cents, but bids from Guangdong Bank and Yuda, among others, supported prices. Sumitomo covered Japanese gold at 101.9375 per tael, so when the shilling was declared it equated to 89 taels and 67 cents. Despite Japanese gold ticking down by 1.25, it held firm, later rising to 91 taels and 4 cents. Meanwhile, Hua &amp; McCallum offered June sterling at 11.8125 pence; HSBC also offered May at the same rate. With small accounts selling, prices dropped over two taels to 88 taels and 8 cents by 10:45. In the afternoon, April sterling traded around 11.75 pence; June by China &amp; Eastern at 11.75; and Hua Shang Bank sold Japanese gold at 102.225 per tael. After 11, the market tightened step by step, buyers remained active, and the price jumped over three taels to 92 taels and 4 cents at midday.</p>
<p>At close the spot gold price rose by three taels and three cents. The afternoon opening was at 92 taels, briefly dipping to 92 taels and 2 cents, but with strong buying by Jin’an, Hengxing, and others, and a steady exchange market, Mitsui bought Japanese gold at 102.375, and HSBC offered US dollars for April at 48 yuan. All banks sold sterling around 11.6875 pence. By 2:30 the price stood at 93 taels, but Yuanheng and others favored selling, and market sentiment soured, pushing it down over two taels. It fluctuated within one tael and a few cents, then by around 4 o’clock dipped to 90 taels and 6 cents. Minor accounts bought, and though foreign exchange remained balanced, gold was pulled up by over a tael to 92 taels, closing at 4:20 at 91 taels and 7 cents—an increase of three taels and three cents over the 19th.</p>
<p>Ornamental gold reached seventy yuan per tael. In one day the highest price was 93 taels and the lowest 88 taels and 6 cents, a swing of 4 taels and 4 cents. The quoted rate was revised to 498 taels and 6 cents, given Japanese gold marking down by 1.25. Early market withheld by nine taels; by midday it only withheld by six taels. Ledger quotes ranged from 92 taels to 91 taels; replenishment at 92 taels. Afternoon replenishment was also at 92 taels. Quoted suppression at 67 taels. Commodity gold opened at 90 taels and 4 cents, fell 2 taels and 6 cents by midday, 2 taels and 1 cent in the afternoon, and closed down 1 tael and 7 cents. Jewelry shops raised ornamental gold by half a yuan per tael to seventy yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday HSBC quoted foreign exchange: Japanese exchange fell by 1.25 to 103.25 per tael; other rates unchanged. Large bills narrowed and exchange rates softened slightly. Overseas telegrams reported the Indian rupee up by 3.75 to 47.3125. Yokohama sterling was slightly firm; the yen‑dollar unchanged; Kobe unchanged. Locally both foreign and domestic exchange markets tightened; from early morning they were firm, then wavered, then firmed again in the afternoon. Spot gold once again exceeded ninety taels, lifting sentiment and linking to exchange demand. Chinese merchant speculators continued short‑covering: Fuchang, Shengda, and others bought £200,000; banks including HSBC, McCallum, Hua &amp; Co., Zhengjin, and Mitsui all sold. Jewish firms sold several tens of thousands of pounds to Sumitomo and Mitsui, but Shengda et al. also sold £200,000–300,000. Mitsui absorbed, and banks inter‑transacted £60,000–70,000. They also cross‑dealt over $100,000. Chinese firms bought $100,000. The yen‑dollar market was quiet, only ¥1,000,000 exchanged; Mitsui and Sumitomo marginally bought; Industry and Commerce Bank sold; Sumitomo also slightly sold. By afternoon close vs. the previous noon, sterling narrowed by 1.25, the dollar by 3.125; yen‑dollar added 0.625; market sentiment still firm.</p>

By midday offers matched the open. In the afternoon Zhengjin offered May £10,000 and June £10,000; Shanghai &amp; Co., China &amp; Eastern, and Mitsui offered June £20,000; Mitsui and Sumitomo bought 2 March £20,000; McCallum, the Korean Bank, and Mitsui offered June £20,000.

Later April could settle at 48.25, but trading was quiet. Midday rates matched open. In the afternoon HSBC and Sumitomo cross‑dealt April $50,000 at 48.00; China &amp; Eastern offered May $25,000 at 48.00. At close March offered 47.8125, April/May 47.9375, June 48.0625; bids added 0.125.</p>
<p>The yen interbank early firmed, then peaked, then steadied in the afternoon, with a range of 0.625 for the day. Chinese merchants traded little, as forward‑cover mismatches made profitable arbitrage impossible. From early morning near/forward quotes were 102.375 bid, 102.25 offered. Soon Mitsui and Sumitomo bought May ¥100,000 at 101.9375, and Sumitomo offered April ¥100,000 at 102.25; Industry &amp; Commerce offered June ¥50,000 at the same.

<p>In yesterday’s local securities market, bond trading was sparse both in spot and futures, with prices overall steady and no large volumes. Supply and demand showed little change. Early morning saw few fluctuations, but later small accounts sold actively, causing prices to oscillate downward, though the trend remained moderate. The 96 bond, Financial, and Zhenglu lost only tenths. The seven‑year and the 25 continued to rise, while Shanhou, Xujuan, and Customs futures fell by fifty to sixty cents. Total spot turnover was only 120,000 yuan; futures opened 5.2 million yuan, with domestic Customs taking over 2.3 million, Xujuan 1.2 million, Shanhou 1.0 million, the 25 under 1.0 million, Zhenglu 430,000, and the seven‑year and 96 bonds extremely light: the seven‑year at 780,000, the 96 at 300,000; markets remained dull.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Yarn and Cotton Yarn Markets Suffering Intense Declines <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is deeply weakened with severe declines, due to weak overseas demand and poor news. Buyers remain cautious, actual sales are light, and abundant stock creates panic. The outlook is pessimistic as public sentiment favors sellers, renewing calls for fifty taels. Looking back on last year’s situation, one cannot help but reflect on dramatic change.</p>
<p>Spot combed yarn plunged over two taels. At the Exchange, Morning Standard Yarn opened with American cotton weakening, down three to four cents. Soon “No. 3” yarn fell sharply, with thin sales and abundant seller supply. New sellers entered; the market suddenly turned, falling 1 tael 5 mace 6 cents. In the afternoon it remained very soft, continuing losses of seven cents to 1 tael 3 cents per month, with distant months dropping past four taels. Total turnover was 23,950 bales. Closing prices of standard yarn:</p>
<p>• May: 1532, down 26; volume 24,000</p>
<p>• June: 1533, down 23; volume 16,700</p>
<p>• March: 1539, down 29; volume 41,250</p>
<p>• April: 1535, down 24; volume 37,000</p>
<p>• February: 1558, down 20; volume 23,100</p>
<p>• July: 1534, down 22; volume 10,800</p>
<p>Spot sales were even thinner, as futures collapsed, prompting suspensions and slight purchases by mills. Total day’s spot turnover was 885 bales, with declines of five cents to over one tael. Among customer districts: 220 bales from the interior, 40 from Changsha, 62 from Qingdao, 10 from Ningbo, 45 from Xuzhou, 30 from Wuhu, 50 from Jiangxi, 35 from Sichuan, 10 from Qinhuangdao, 18 from Fujian, 15 from Niuzhuang, 15 from Xiamen, 25 from Nanyang, 25 from Shantou; traders took 275 bales.</p>

<p>American cotton continues downward; the yarn market’s tragedy dampens sentiment. Spot trading stalls; market confidence weakens. Holders remain steady, so the cotton market is less drastic than yarn. Demand is passive; occasional Indian cotton deals offer little morale. The market remains stuck.</p>
<p>Standard cotton followed overseas declines. At the Wuhan Exchange, morning U.S. cotton falls and weak yarn markets softened sentiment; losses of three to four cents across months. In the afternoon, buyers held firm, preventing proportional declines; each month recovered five to ten cents. Total turnover was 41,700 piculs. Closing standard cotton prices:</p>
<p>• February: 348.5, down 20; volume 34,800</p>
<p>• May: 534.5, down 30; volume 68,300</p>
<p>• March: 343.0, down 30; volume 65,300</p>
<p>• April: 341.5, down 30; volume 70,400</p>

<p>• July: 342.0, down 40; volume 30,200</p>
<p>Spot cotton trading was muted. On the pier, Xingxing delivered 500 cases at 34 taels 5 cents through the Shenxin mill; goods consigned to the factory.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Overseas Yarn Market Declines Again <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>

<h3 id="e123">Grain Flour Prices Continue to Decline with Foreign Wheat <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Slight recovery before close.</p>
<p>In yesterday’s flour market, after the morning opening, there was a sudden sharp fall in line with foreign wheat quotes which retreated by one yuan. Speculators believed foreign wheat was tipping, reversing the old pattern of larger falls and smaller rises, making foreign wheat arrivals to China seem possible. This shook confidence and led to sharp declines at opening, which for domestic conditions was welcome news for the poor. In the afternoon, however, after floating positions covered shorts and some mills bought, the market stabilized slightly and began to recover. Ultimately, compared with the previous day’s close, this month’s contract was down only 1.5 cents; March/April down 1.5 cents; May down 1.25 cents; June down 5 cents; with July unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Wheat Market Hard to Rally Further <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Foreign wheat frequently down slightly; spot arrivals flood; futures collapse.</p>
<p>Yesterday spot wheat plunged uniformly after foreign wheat quotes fell by one yuan, triggering a wave of liquidations. Recent attempts to rally by external interests failed as the environment turned adverse. Domestic wheat prices, now high, encouraged holders to offer for sale, leading to heavy arrivals from various sources—the primary cause of the wheat market’s weakness. The month’s contract bottomed at 5 taels 1.7 cents, recovered 1 cent at close but was still down 4 cents from the previous day. March down 6 cents; April down 5 cents; June and July roughly even. The spot market is saturated by stocks; mills lack appetite, thus prices must fall further to resume activity.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Rice Market: Northern Steady, Southern Firm <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>In Zhabei yesterday, various shipments arrived, totaling around thirty vessels; retail sales lacked the previous day’s vigor. Northern high‑grade japonica remained firm; second‑grade, after consecutive rises, saw buyers cautious, anticipating corrections. But sellers, mindful of costs, refused to lower, so transactions decreased. Standard indica needs were light; though supplies were scant, prices lagged slightly. Yangdu indica remained firm; sellers attempted to corner, keeping the market steady. Local mixed indica sales proceeded; river shipments were few, prices similar to the last close. Southern Shanghai imports were scarce, but with northern demand firm, they rose neatly.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Foreign Rice Futures Mixed <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>In yesterday’s foreign rice market, only small Cochin broken rice—3,000 bags—was quoted; other grades were unavailable due to scarcity. Futures trading was good, but small broken rice spot had two months of supply and heavy selling, so futures softened and spot was weak. Only Saigon rice attracted inquiries, but with scarce supplies, firms refused to sell, pushing futures up another four to five cents. Thai broken rice also sold off, depressing the market. Totals: spot small broken 3,000 bags traded at 13.60–13.20 yuan. Futures: No. 1 Saigon Feb 50 tons at 6.268; Apr/May 2,000 bags at 6.3424; No. 2 Mar 1,000 bags at 6.220; small broken Feb 1,000 bags at 6.014; Mitsubishi sold small broken Mar 3,000 tons at 5.093, big broken Mar 1,000 tons at 5.078, Thai broken Mar 1,700 tons at 6.03.</p>

<p>Frost damage from snow likely to sharply reduce output.</p>
<p>(A Feb 14 dispatch from Wuyuan) Anhui’s key tea counties—Wuyuan, Qimen, Xiuning, Shexian, and Qiupu—produce famed Qimen black and Wuyuan green teas, prized by British, American, and French merchants. Annual output exceeds 400,000 chests, 40% of China’s total. Shanghai market swings depend on Anhui tea performance, so any shortfall draws attention. This winter’s extreme cold and heavy snow have long‑pressed tea trees, causing frost damage: red leaves falling, and with lingering cold into spring, an estimated one‑fifth of the tea trees have wilted—unprecedented in thirty years. Locals estimate spring growth will be far weaker and yields significantly lower. Even with intensive fertilization and care, output might not exceed 70% of normal.</p>

<p>In yesterday’s local foreign silk market, conditions were firm and smooth. European firms, seeing overseas raw silk sales rising sharply and stocks low, grew optimistic. Silk supplies are limited, bolstering sentiment. Yesterday, Hua Tong and others bought thirty bales of Shanghai White Factory silk; Xinfu and others bought twenty bales of Sichuan Huang Factory silk; Xiangli and others bought sixteen bales of cotton‑reeled silk, all at firm prices.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting had originally planned to arrive in Shanghai yesterday to attend the Red Cross Society’s welcome assembly for Vice President Yu Qiaqing’s assumption of duties. Due to pressing matters preventing him from freeing himself, he instead came last night by night train with Sun Ke, Song Ziwen, and Wei Daoming, arriving at the port at seven this morning. At eight this evening, he will entertain the newly appointed Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Li Jinlun, and his wife at his private residence on Guba Road. Because Mr. Wang must return to Nanjing on the evening of the 23rd in order to present his credentials to the Norwegian envoy in Beijing on the 24th, he will depart promptly that night.</p>
<h3 id="e131">River and Sea Shipping News <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, a local steamship company here received a report from Nanjing stating that a Yangtze River steamer, having passed Huangshi Harbor eastbound below Hankou, was suddenly fired upon from both riverbanks. Fortunately the vessel had increased speed and no crew were injured, and since there were no passengers aboard at the time, there was no loss. Incidents of sporadic rifle fire along the route have resumed in recent days. To ensure safety, operators of all river steamers have agreed to install steel plates outside the engine rooms on vessels traveling upriver, so as to avoid danger.</p>
<p>Railway materials for the Longhai Railway have all been purchased abroad and unloaded here in Shanghai. Last winter, the royal shipping company of that country arranged eight commercial steamers specifically to transport rolling stock and steel rails for the Longhai line; three of these have already arrived, each fully laden with Longhai Railway cargo. As usual, they unloaded at Pukou before forwarding to Zhengzhou and other destinations. This latest shipment includes four locomotives and over two thousand tons of railway materials, which have just arrived. After discussion yesterday, it was decided to unload these at Wusong and await the opening of the Longhai line before transferring them onward.</p>
<p>Outbound cargo for Haizhou has sharply declined. Most of the goods shipped from Shanghai to Haizhou are transshipments bound for Kaifeng, Luoyang, Shaanxi, and Gansu. Three steamers now serve that route, but this month each has made only a single voyage, and outbound cargo has been scant. Recently, due to the unsettled situation, all Haizhou transshipment cargo destined for Kaifeng, Luoyang, Shaanxi, and Gansu has been halted. Whether the Haizhou steamers can resume voyages after returning to Shanghai this time remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Suspension and Resumption of Chinese Steamers. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company’s Guangli steamer, returning from Guangdong to Shanghai via Amoy, was reported yesterday to have been requisitioned at Xiamen for troop transport to Quanzhou, making it difficult to sail to Shanghai for the time being. As for the trade steamers Gongping and Guangda, which had been scheduled to depart for Beijing from Shanghai upon arrival, the Navigation Department yesterday notified that they need not make the voyage to the capital. Consequently, the Merchants Bureau plans to reassign those two vessels to the South and North China coastal lines to meet passenger and cargo transport needs.</p>

<p>Over eighty groups—including the Southern Goods Subcommittee, Dental Articles Subcommittee, Silk and Satin Subcommittee, Poultry and Vegetable Stall Subcommittee, Fresh Sausage Subcommittee, Duck Vendor Subcommittee, and others under the Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce—sent telegrams yesterday to President Chiang Kai-shek and Deputy Commander Yan Xishan of the National Government, appealing for peace.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Municipal Executive Committee Sends Another Telegram of Earnest Advice to Yan Xishan <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee previously sent a telegram on the 15th to Yan Xishan requesting clarification of the true situation, but received no reply. Yesterday (the 20th), they sent another earnest advisory telegram stating: “The nation is in crisis and summons you to return immediately. Comrade Yan Baichuan in Taiyuan, please take note: from the moment your telegram was sent, the entire country was alarmed, interpreting your call for courtesy and yielding as a breach of discipline. Should you stray from the path and not return, you will surely precipitate renewed internal strife. Since we had not yet seen the original message, we hesitated to believe it. We respectfully inquire again and trust you will examine this carefully. Now the newspapers report extensive exchanges of telegrams, your statements grow ever more extraordinary, and your positions ever more erroneous. Our committee, holding fast to the Supreme Leader’s teachings of loyalty and sincerity, earnestly hopes you will not, for political expediency, follow in the footsteps of Feng Tang or Zhang Gui, thereby undermining your own revolutionary record. We therefore dare to summarize the essential principles and offer this renewed counsel:</p>
<p>“A revolutionary party member must embody the character of revolution, and a revolutionary soldier must uphold revolutionary morality. The revolutionary cause exists to benefit others, not oneself. Thus, the success of the revolution depends entirely on whether the nation and the people have been saved, without regard to personal considerations. By this standard, the so‑called ‘revolutionary character and morality’ means: 1) Serving the people without seeking shortcuts or personal comfort—not about courtesy, yielding, or resting—but about sacrificing for the nation, unafraid of hardship and unyielding, not compromise or hedging. 2) Uniting and obeying under the party’s principles, not opportunism, deception, or disciplinary breaches—definitely not intrigue or clandestine maneuvering. Our party, following the Supreme Leader’s final instructions, has struggled steadfastly for years, never yielding. There is now a fragile opportunity for peaceful unification that could serve as the basis for our tutelage and reconstruction. Comrade Chiang Kai-shek, entrusted by the party and the nation with heavy responsibilities, works ceaselessly; how could he tolerate being overthrown? Your pretext of courtesy and yielding as a condition for resignation is mere opportunism and a refusal to revolutionize. You even propose entrapping Comrade Chiang to deprive the revolution of its leader—this is a grave error. The party has a history and an organizational system: three terms of Central Committee, unanimously elected at the Third National Congress with the trust of all party comrades, exercising authority without reproach. If, as you propose, the three-term plenary, senior leaders, or even founding elders each voice conflicting dreams, the system will collapse, regulations be rendered meaningless, and our governance perish. Cooperation or hedging may be tolerable; calling it loyalty to the revolution is not. These are two serious mistakes. In a successful revolution, party members have no personal liberty: the Supreme Leader’s final teachings remain clear. Comrades, could you really forget that our warlords have only just been swept away and rebellion nearly extinguished? At this critical juncture, if one seeks to save the nation by abandoning party adherence and the rule of law, there is no alternative path. To speak of ‘respecting the party’ requires defending the Central Authority; to speak of ‘upholding the law’ requires obedience to orders. Your Taiyuan pledge of allegiance and Zhengzhou support of the central army remain fresh, yet you now call the suppression of rebellion a ‘civil war’ intended to stop disorder and threaten the Central Authority, arrogantly opposing the National Government, wielding troops in territorial fiefdoms. Such defiance shows contempt for central orders and free action—where is your unity? If your heart is not set on opportunism or deception, you would not commit illegal or disorderly acts. These are three errors. Our committee deeply remembers your past contributions and cannot bear to see you destroy your own standing, bringing pain to friends and joy to foes. We propose three courses:</p>
<p>“First, if you repent, you should clearly seek national rest by first preserving unity—upholding the central authority. You might emulate the great statesmen of Japan who relinquished military power, entered Tokyo to serve, supported the central government, and facilitated tutelage. Second, if you still wish to remain in the North, you must lead your troops in obedience, diligently pursue governance, and stabilize civilian life. Third, if not, you must immediately resign and return state affairs to the Central Committee, fulfilling your promise of yielding, even if it means sacrificing personal liberty, yet remaining a man of integrity.</p>
<p>“Should you fail to do so and persist in erroneous arguments and frightening rhetoric, confusing right and wrong, betraying discipline, pressuring responsible central officials, and shielding those who defy orders, you will inevitably tread the path of counter‑revolution and become the author of renewed internal chaos—a fate our comrades cannot bear. You must choose your course wisely.”</p>

<h3 id="e134">Red Cross Society Held Meeting Yesterday to Welcome Yu Qiaqing’s Assumption of Duties <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Accounts of the Relief Fund Department Thoroughly Audited</p>
<p>Bylaw Revisions for the Red Cross Society Decided</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society held a welcome assembly at Yipinxiang yesterday at three o’clock in the afternoon to honor Vice President Yu Qiaqing’s assumption of duties. Dozens of attendees included Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Shiguang, and representatives from various branch societies. President Yan Huiqing also sent a representative. Vice President Wang Zhengting was unable to attend due to pressing governmental affairs and specially telegrammed Chen Shiguang to represent him. Chairman of the General Assembly Wang Yiting delivered the opening address, after which Yu Qiaqing stood to speak. He said briefly: “I am truly unworthy of your warm welcome. Until now, the Vice Presidents in Shanghai have been responsible for the Society’s work. As the Red Cross has an international character and carries significant weight in national and diplomatic matters, and because the Society holds over one hundred thousand yuan in cash and assets worth hundreds of thousands more, the future prospects for our work are bright. My previous sudden resignation was due to my objection to the Relief Fund Department being established within the Red Cross Society. While I do not oppose relief work, embedding the Relief Fund Department in the Red Cross has led to all annual Society revenues being diverted to relief expenditures, causing a surge in spending and depletion of income sources. Our hundreds of thousands in funds could be exhausted in a few years, forcing the Red Cross to effectively collapse. Since the Relief Fund Department was approved by the Standing Council, I felt compelled by the gravity of the situation and the danger ahead to resign and to halt further allocations to relief, to prevent the Society’s foundations from being shaken. The Standing Council then formed a provisional executive committee to reorganize and revise the bylaws. The Departments of Diplomacy, Internal Affairs, and Health also dispatched personnel to Shanghai to investigate the Society’s operations, concluding that the bylaws must be amended as soon as possible. I fully support the establishment of an executive committee, for the Red Cross is an international enterprise that cannot be monopolized by a few individuals. Without bylaw revisions, there can be no solution, so I could only resign.”</p>
<p>Discussion then turned to proposals from the branches to request that the President conduct a thorough audit of the Relief Fund Department’s accounts, publishing detailed expenditures. The Chairman will report on this. The Relief Fund Department is now concluding its work; in future the Economic Board will examine the accounts in detail, followed by an auditor’s verification. The meeting adjourned at six. It was learned that on April 20 in Shanghai the Third General Assembly of all members will convene to discuss the bylaw revisions and elect officers. Yu Qiaqing’s vice‑presidential role will last only until that assembly.</p>

<p>In the ongoing Sino-Japanese treaty revision, the two countries’ diplomatic authorities have gone back and forth several times, and tariff issues have been negotiated to agreement. It was planned that other matters would be discussed in detail this week when the Japanese chargé d’affaires Kōkō—a shorthand for Reijun Shigemitsu—arrived in Beijing to continue consultations. However, in recent days the chargé has repeatedly postponed his departure and made no firm preparations to travel to the capital. While Japan is undergoing elections and its political situation is unsettled, the Foreign Ministry has used China’s internal turbulence as a pretext for delay, which is the main reason for the postponements. The Japanese, having no genuine intent to relinquish navigation, judicial, or tariff rights, must resist treaty changes, hence their continual stalling. From recent Japanese attitudes, a breakdown has indeed occurred and negotiations seem likely to stall indefinitely.</p>

<p>The Silk and Satin Subcommittee of the Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce and the China Domestic Silk Shanghai Relief Association jointly telegrammed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, requesting that in the upcoming Sino-Japanese treaty the silk tariff rates between the two countries be set on the principle of equal reciprocity. Their telegram reads: “To Minister Wang of the MFA: We understand that Korea is a major consumer of silk, and Chinese silk exports there once totaled two million yuan annually—of great importance to our national economy and people’s livelihood. Since 1923, Japan’s protectionist policy has restricted Chinese silk, imposing punitive duties as high as 100%. Over the past six or seven years all sales to Korea have ceased, causing unbearable hardship for our industry and unemployment. Despite repeated appeals by our silk associations and protests to the diplomatic authorities, nothing has changed. Now that a new treaty is imminent, although the Japanese have acknowledged our tariff autonomy, they demand a Most‑Favored‑Nation rate on dozens of varieties. They continue to exact punitive duties and unjustly coerce us. How can this be called equal reciprocity? We therefore petition your honorable ministry: when the new treaty is formally signed this autumn, silk tariff rates between our two countries must adhere to equal reciprocity—if they do not lower theirs, we will not lower ours. We will vigorously defend our position without concession, to protect our silk industry and uphold national dignity. We await your kind attention.”</p>

<p>After the resignation of Plant Manager Hu Shuhua, his successor has not yet assumed office, and the mill’s funds have been exhausted. On the 17th, Hu went to Beijing to seek guidance from the Ministry of Military Affairs. He returned to Shanghai yesterday morning and, finding no solution to the funding problem and with the unsettled situation making financing especially difficult, decided to suspend operations temporarily. Yesterday afternoon, upon arriving at the Gaochang Temple mill site, he issued a notice stating: “Due to blocked product sales and financial difficulties, we applied for emergency funds on the 13th, and on the 14th received a telegram from the Arsenal Administration that no funds were available. If operations cannot be sustained, temporary suspension is authorized.” After Hu personally went to Beijing for confirmation, the Department head verbally approved the suspension, pending the arrival of new Plant Manager Zhou to assess conditions and determine further measures. Accordingly, operations will be suspended from the 21st of this month until Manager Zhou arrives to decide on next steps. This is hereby announced.</p>

<p>In a letter from the MFA’s Shanghai office reporting correspondence from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ Zhejiang Negotiator Zhao Wenrui, it was stated that upon the closure of the provincial negotiation office at the end of the 18th year, all case files not related to foreign affairs were handed to the Hangzhou Municipal Government per the third article of the post‑closure procedures. The remaining case files to be sent to the Ministry had been presented in three old volumes plus one new register for inspection by the MFA. By Directive No. 17 of the MFA, all new and old files, being of great importance, were to be dispatched immediately to the Shanghai office for inspection and safekeeping. Accordingly, beyond sending those boxed files to Shanghai, the office requested confirmation of whether all four registers had been forwarded. If not, the Shanghai office should remind the Ministry to dispatch them so that personnel could proceed at once to Shanghai to verify and receive them.</p>
<p>Upon receipt, the Shanghai office wrote to the MFA’s General Affairs Department to request these registers. Negotiator Zhao Wenrui has already sealed eight large boxes of the new and old files, handed them to the Hangzhou Datong Transport Company for shipment to Shanghai, and they arrived yesterday afternoon at the MFA’s Shanghai office at Maplewood Bridge. Once the registers are issued from Nanjing, Zhao will send staff to Shanghai to unseal and verify them against the lists.</p>

Damuqiao Road—conveniently located between Longhua Road and Xietu Road not far from the Municipal Government—was chosen as the planting site. To raise public awareness, the committee will solicit articles from forestry experts, publish special supplements in major newspapers, and engage the Party Education Bureau and public speakers for popular lectures. A simple explanatory pamphlet will be printed and distributed to all sectors, and films will be shown to increase interest. During the Campaign Week, ten thousand seedlings—both ornamental and practical species—will be prepared for distribution to district Party branches, schools, rural areas, and citizens. Selection of seedling species will be handled by committee members Mei Chengzhang and Chen Jixi in coordination with the Social Affairs Bureau’s Campaign Week office.

<h3 id="e147">Ministry of Agriculture and Mining Approves Interim Measures for Inspection of Plant Diseases and Pests <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>(Interim Measures for the Inspection of Plant Diseases and Pests by the Agricultural Produce Inspection Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining) Approved by the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining on February 15, Year 19 of the Republic, to be promulgated and implemented by the Ministry.</p>

The sequence of inspections for these categories shall be subject to Ministry approval upon proposal by the Inspection Office.</p>
<p>(Article 4) Anyone transporting the products listed in the preceding article must complete the inspection application form prescribed by the Inspection Office, and present it along with the shipping manifest, inspection fee, and license fee at the designated inspection office.

<p>(Article 8) Specimens of pathogens or pests imported for academic research must first obtain a permit from the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, and upon arrival must be reported to the Inspection Office and found error‑free before entry is permitted.</p>
<p>(Article 9) Even if products pass inspection, they must be re‑inspected if re‑packaged or combined; re‑inspection fees shall be waived.</p>
<p>(Article 10) For inspections, the Inspection Office shall temporarily reduce the fee prescribed by Article 4 of the Agricultural Produce Inspection Regulations from 2% to 1%. The license fee shall be one national currency yuan per certificate in accordance with Article 6 of the Regulations.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Cargo Vessel Registration Extension <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Until the end of March</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau is responsible for registering and inspecting cargo vessels. By previous announcement, the deadline had been extended through February 20. As of yesterday, statistics show that over 7,000 vessels have been registered and inspected. However, the total number of cargo vessels in the city exceeds 20,000, which clearly cannot all be inspected within such a short period. Therefore, we have again submitted to the Municipal Government a request to extend the deadline to the end of March. All unregistered cargo vessels must without exception report for inspection by the deadline. Do not adopt a wait‑and‑see approach.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Municipal Government Orders Civil Servants to Use Domestic Products <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Our nation’s industries lag behind, and foreign goods flood the markets. In clothing and accessories, imported items compete to showcase novelty, and our citizens eagerly purchase them. According to customs reports, in the seventeenth fiscal year imports of foreign goods totaled 1,195,969,000 taels. Among these, silk, hemp, cotton, wool, and leather products alone amounted to more than 360,957,400 taels, demonstrating that spending on clothing and accessories is a major reason for our trade deficit. Recently, to alleviate the financial situation, the Ministry of Commerce petitioned the National Government to issue a clear order requiring all civil and military officials, within and outside the capital, to strictly use domestic products from the date of promulgation in order to stem the outflow of funds. The National Government has issued this directive for nationwide compliance. Upon receipt of this order, the Municipal Government immediately instructed all its civil servants to comply fully.</p>
<h3 id="e150">News from the Swiss Industrial Exhibition in Shanghai <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Exhibition Period: April 26 to May 6</p>
<p>Location: Still in Basel</p>
<p>Swiss industry, whether producing large machinery or small watches, pursues excellence in every aspect. Its industrial progress is remarkable. Exports include power-driven machines, electrical appliances, instruments, clocks and watches, gemstones, chemical and pharmaceutical products, silk and woolen textiles, embroidered goods, boots and shoes, chocolate, condensed milk, and butter. All these items share superior material and craftsmanship. Since Switzerland must import its raw materials, its global competitiveness relies entirely on the refinement of its manufactured goods.</p>
<p>Since the fifteenth century, Basel has held an annual industrial exhibition. The upcoming 14th exhibition runs from April 26 to May 6 this year, again at its traditional venue. Reorganized in 1917, the exhibition’s reputation has grown. Basel, on the Rhine River, is a hub of railways and shipping lines, and a center of finance and industry, making it an ideal location. The exhibition is noted for its complete facilities and exquisite displays, praised by the international business community. Visitors can, within a few hours, view the full range of Swiss products.</p>
<p>All exhibits are Swiss-made and presented by dozens of firms, serving as a forum for exchanging industrial and commercial knowledge and fostering progress. Originally intended for domestic participants, the exhibition’s strategic location has made it an international trade center, attracting over 300,000 visitors. As a purely commercial event, its aim is to expand the market for Switzerland’s refined yet affordable goods and cultivate international trade relations.</p>
<p>From 1923 to 1927, ten trillion Swiss francs were allocated to build a dedicated exhibition hall and equipment. At the exhibition, staff extend every convenience to foreign visitors seeking to purchase goods or tour the exhibits. A special office handles facility rentals; typists and interpreters are available; telephone and telegraph services are especially convenient. A permanent inquiry desk answers questions about Swiss products at any time, without charge. Attendees may also tour Switzerland’s famous mountains, rivers, and scenic sites.</p>
<p>The Swiss Consulate General in Shanghai, at No. 1415 Xiamei Road, is pleased to provide information at any time regarding exhibition details, lodging, and transport.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Municipal Land Bureau Announcement on Survey and Certificate Issuance <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Certificates to Be Issued for Diagrams 5 and 9 in Hunan District 59</p>
<p>Yesterday the Land Bureau issued a notice stating that upon completion of its surveys, land use certificates must be issued for Diagram 5 of Bao 25 and Diagram 9 in Hunan District. Owners of these diagrams are requested, from February 21 and within one month, to submit their land registers, grain quotas, and other evidence for verification. Once confirmed valid, the original land registers will be canceled and retained by the bureau, and owners will receive receipts to present when obtaining their land use certificates. This notice is issued for general awareness among the owners.</p>
<p>Surveys Completed in Caoying, Yangsi, and Other Areas of Hunan District</p>
<p>The Land Bureau has completed surveys of plots in Caoying, Yangsi, and a third area in Hunan District. The names of all plot owners are now being entered on topographical maps based on the survey registers. Since completion, changes of ownership through sale have resulted in occasional name changes. To secure property rights, when contracts for land sales are executed in these diagrams, the transferee must submit the purchased land register and grain quota when paying taxes. They will then exchange these for a land use certificate.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Borrowing Funds to Build Housing for Commoners <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Submitted to the Construction Discussion Council by Mayoral Order</p>
<p>In order to build housing for commoners, the Committee for Planning Commoners’ Housing previously deliberated on borrowing methods, construction, and repayment with interest, and submitted a proposal to the Mayor for review. We report that throughout the city—east, west, north, and south—grass huts stand densely side by side, visible everywhere, totaling approximately 22,000 households. Most residents are laborers and porters. These huts are extremely fire-prone, and any disaster can easily burn hundreds of homes, causing unimaginable suffering. Additionally, the low living standards and poor sanitation among residents, especially in summer and autumn, breed epidemics. Unemployed vagrants also congregate, and with no household registration or street numbers, police patrols are difficult. This is a serious public security issue and tarnishes the city’s image at a critical stage of municipal development.</p>
<p>In advanced industrial countries, factory owners often provide adequate housing for workers. Our industry is nascent and factory capital insufficient to care for commoners’ livelihoods. At this initial stage of municipal construction, the government must urgently build housing for commoners and eliminate the grass huts. However, the scale of this undertaking is immense. To build over one hundred housing units and a large assembly hall will require more than 20,000 yuan. Given the current municipal treasury’s deficit, we cannot address this urgent need without securing substantial additional funds. Therefore, we propose two methods: borrowing from the financial sector and charitable organizations, and requesting the treasury to allocate annual appropriations.</p>
<p>We plan to borrow 500,000 yuan from various sectors and request the treasury to provide 100,000 yuan, to build 3,000 housing units. The borrowed funds will bear an annual interest rate to be paid from rental income, with the principal to be repaid by the treasury over five or ten years, at 100,000 yuan or 50,000 yuan per year. For these reasons, it is appropriate to draft a schedule for borrowing, repayment, and interest, and submit it for approval. If approved, a joint proposal will then be presented to the Construction Discussion Council for decision, so that commoners’ housing can be implemented in stages. Whether this is advisable, we respectfully request your judgment.</p>
<p>After review, the Mayor found the plan sound in principle but noted the treasury’s deficit and the difficulty of borrowing—especially at a time of bond issuance—and instructed that proposals related to the livelihood of commoners be submitted to the Construction Discussion Council for deliberation.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Wang Leping and Others Were Encoffined Yesterday <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Wang Leping, a former member of the second Central Executive Committee, together with his friend Pan Xingjian and their servant Kang Ruizhai, were assassinated at 11:30 p.m. on the 18th while at the salon located at No. 314, Xiamen Lane, on Ma Road in the French Concession. Details were reported in our two previous issues. Yesterday afternoon, the bodies of the three men, as well as another body found on the road, were taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall mortuary. Following inspection by Chinese and French officials, all families were notified that the bodies could only be received for encoffining upon telephone notice from the police detention office. At about 3 p.m. yesterday, police agents were ordered to return for a second photography session, and relatives personally completed the encoffining. Upon request by the families of Wang and Pan, photography was not permitted by the police. After encoffining, more than twenty relatives accompanied the two coffins onto funeral carts for placement in the association’s mortuary. The encoffining of the servant Kang and the man found roadside is expected to occur today.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Designated Loading and Unloading Areas for Wusong Bamboo and Timber Rafts <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Regulations by the Port Authority</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Port Authority has regulated the northern bank of the Wusong (Suzhou) River, from the vicinity of Xinjialaji Bridge on Guangfu Road westward to the Guangzhao Villa area. The thoroughfare is busy, the river channel narrow, and vessel traffic congested. Along the riverbank, bamboo and timber dealers have erected rafts and arbitrarily scattered them across the water, obstructing navigation and causing silt accumulation. Immediate enforcement is necessary to maintain traffic.</p>
<p>Based on the Regulations for the Control of Bamboo and Timber Rafts and practical conditions, the authority has formulated these measures: each dealer’s loading and unloading area may not exceed 100 Shanghai feet in length and 20 Shanghai feet in width. For each delivery, the Port Authority will provide a report form for dealers to complete and submit. Officers will inspect and set specific loading and unloading dates. All rafts must be completely removed by those dates. Outside the permitted dates, no materials may be piled on the riverbank. Violators will be fined. These measures have been approved by the Municipal Government and publicly announced. On the 21st of this month, officers will inspect the riverbank areas along the Wusong River to enforce the designated zones. After this cleanup, navigation will be greatly facilitated.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Processes Accountant Registrations <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The Accountant Regulations were enacted and promulgated some time ago. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has received instructions from the Municipal Government to enforce these regulations. Article 2 stipulates that accountants operate under the supervision of the Ministry of Commerce, but provincial or non‑provincial municipal commerce authorities, within the scope of the Ministry’s directives, may also exercise supervisory powers. Article 8 requires that, before beginning their duties, accountants must submit an application letter and credentials to the local commerce authority for verification, after which they are to be entered in the Register of Accountants. Article 10 mandates that provincial or non‑provincial municipal commerce authorities report all accountant registrations and cancellations to the Ministry of Commerce and notify all courts in their jurisdiction. Accordingly, the bureau has processed registrations in compliance with the regulations. To date, many practitioners have registered with the bureau, which has forwarded the records to the Ministry of Commerce and notified the courts, approving them to practice in the city.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Sensational News in Shanghai: Kidnapping on the Huangpu River <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Yangsi Township Municipal Committee Member Chen Tianxi</p>
<p>At dusk, encountered bandits in mid-stream</p>
<p>Passengers were forced into the water</p>
<p>The Shen large ferry’s whereabouts unknown</p>
<p>At about 6 p.m. yesterday, midway between Dongjiadu in the southern part of the city and Zhoujiadu in Pudong on the Huangpu River, a violent hijacking and abduction occurred aboard a ferry. Here are the details:</p>
<p>Chen Tianxi, a municipal political committee member of Yangsi Township in Pudong—styled Zixin and from a well-established family—frequently crossed to Puxi due to his official duties. Last night, while on the ferry, he was noticed by bandits and abducted.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Chen had driven by automobile from his home to Zhoujiadu. After a brief rest, at about 6 p.m. he boarded the large ferry that shuttles between Zhoujiadu and Dongjiadu. When the ferry reached midstream, six bandits armed with handguns appeared. Two of them kept watch over Chen, while the others forced all passengers into the water. Simultaneously, they threatened the ferry’s pilot at the bow, demanding he steer northward. With no choice, the pilot obeyed and steered the vessel north.</p>
<p>Passengers who had dived into the river swam to shore and reported the incident. Many Pudong residents living along the riverbank are skilled swimmers, so they reached land and rushed to inform the Sanqu District Third Police Post in Tangqiao Town. The post commander immediately notified the District 3 General Office, which in turn telephoned the Municipal Headquarters. The Headquarters alerted all Pudong police stations and the river patrol unit to be on alert for interception. It is reported that many passengers were forced into the water, and there are likely casualties.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the alert, the police in each district dispatched officers—many armed with rifles—to patrol the riverbanks. The Headquarters also wired Minhang and Songjiang checkpoints to join the search. At the time of this report’s publication, the ferry had not been located. It is unclear whether the bandits sailed it through Minhang or Songjiang or disembarked at a secluded riverside location. Our newspaper, upon hearing the news, telephoned each police district to confirm the identity of the abducted official. They confirmed that it was indeed Chen, the municipal committee member of Yangsi Township in Pudong, without doubt.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Case of Steamed-Bone Examination: Corpse Bones Dismembered Inch by Inch <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Mrs. Chen Sun’s corpse had not fully decomposed</p>
<p>The steaming and bone-examining procedure was quite complex</p>
<p>The removal of skin and flesh was unbearable to behold</p>
<p>The deceased’s left shinbone bore a hooked protrusion.</p>
<p>In the case concerning Mrs. Chen Sun, daughter-in-law of the late “Northern King” Chen Shuangxi—who had operated the Qinglian Pavilion teahouse at Suzhou’s Chang Gate and the Chen Wanxing lime shop at Yadanqiao—and suspected of having died under suspicious circumstances, the Shanghai District Court conducted a steamed-bone examination, details of which were reported yesterday. It has now been ascertained that the alleged incident occurred on the 17th day of the third lunar month last year, while Chen Shuangxi himself fell ill and died on the 18th. On that same day, the Wuxian District Court dispatched personnel to inspect the body and found minor non-fatal injuries on the head, at the corners of the eyes, and on the legs. The cause of death was determined to be suicide by hanging. The Wuxian Court fined the deceased’s stepmother, Mrs. Chen Li, 200 silver dollars for improper custody of the body, and decided not to prosecute in the matter of suicide. However, the deceased’s father, Sun Zhengwen, was dissatisfied and filed an appeal, which the Higher Court promptly dismissed based on the autopsy report. Sun then appealed to the Supreme Court, requesting a steamed-bone examination to uncover the truth. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the Higher Court, which in turn transferred jurisdiction to the Shanghai District Court and ordered it to handle the matter.</p>
<p>Sun Zhengwen named five defendants in his suit. Besides the corpse-porter Chen Xuebǎo, they included the stepmother Mrs. Chen Li and the sister-in-law Mrs. Chen Chang (wife of Chen Ajin). The chief offender was alleged to be the paternal aunt, Mrs. Chen Li, who—though not deeply involved in household affairs—harbored dislike for the deceased, sowed discord, and caused the young couple to live apart for more than three months until the time of death. The aunt was even said to have advocated murder by strangulation. The defendants vehemently denied these charges, insisting that the deceased died at about 4 p.m. entirely by her own hanging and that no one would dare commit murder in broad daylight. Chen Xuebǎo, age twenty-eight, came from Baoying in Jiangbei; the deceased, age twenty-six (twenty-five at the time of death last year), was from Xinghua. She had married into the Chen family on December 18 at age twenty-three and died on the 17th of the third month at twenty-five—just over a year later.</p>
<p>Yesterday at 10 a.m., plaintiffs Sun Zhengwen and his wife, together with defendants Chen Xuebǎo, Mrs. Chen Li, and her son, all reported to the court. They were escorted by Prosecutor Yang Wenjun along with examiners Shen Xiqing, Xuan Yifang, Xuan Zhiming, and others to the forensic examination office. In the presence of both parties, the coffin was opened and the body removed. The outer burial garments were a red silk blanket; beneath were layers of sky-blue satin underskirt, red silk cotton jacket, blue silk padded jacket, white silk-linen shirt; on the lower body were red silk split trousers and white silk-linen underpants, plus an embroidered red skirt; the head wore a lotus-flower hat, and the feet small red shoes. When stripped, the skin and flesh had not decomposed, though the eyes and nose on the face were rotted. Examiners Shen and Xuan then cut away the skin and flesh from the entire body, scraping out the bones and slicing them inch by inch—a sight too gruesome to behold. The complicated procedure continued until after 4 p.m., when they finally declared the examination complete. Each bone was labeled with its name on a bamboo tag and laid out on a mat in the shape of a human form. The removed skin and flesh were placed back into the coffin. Judge Yang ordered that the bones be wrapped in white cloth and also placed into the coffin. The coffin was sealed all around in the presence of both parties, and the ground beside it and the lid were stamped with the lime seal of the Jiangsu–Shanghai District Court to underscore the solemnity. The forensic office’s doors and windows were sealed as well. At 7 a.m. the next day—today—the bones were to be washed and then subjected to a second steam-bone examination in eight steamer baskets. Judicial police were assigned to stand guard in shifts overnight. Judge Yang instructed all parties not to leave. During the initial scraping, it was noted that the deceased had certain bone anomalies: the head of the left tibia bore a hook-like growth, and the third and fourth left ribs were joined in a Y-shaped fork. Examiners Xuan reported that such bone structures had never been seen before.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Chinese Policeman Won’t Yield to Western Constable <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Western police head offers apology first</p>
<p>Kong Zhaocun receives official commendation</p>
<p>Yesterday the Shanghai Special Municipal Police Bureau issued a directive to all its precincts, stating that according to the report of Captain Tao Guangqu of the Fifth District Station No. 2, on February 8 at about 5 p.m., at the corner of North Sichuan Road and Guangdong Street, station guard Kong Zhaocun reported that a Western constable had stepped forward and barred the sidewalk on the city side at the sluice-gate. Kong asserted that his post lay within Chinese jurisdiction and told the constable he had not crossed any boundary. The constable, however, showed a fierce manner and demanded the guard’s badge number. When Kong replied that he had none, the constable examined him closely and found his number to be 187. Because Kong refused to yield, the constable walked away uttering words about requesting reprimand. The matter was under review when the next morning Captain Odo of the Diswei Road Precinct arrived and stated that the newly appointed Western constable No. 187 had reported that the Chinese guard had overstepped the boundary line, leading to a slight verbal clash when he questioned the guard. The precinct insisted that its border guards were all seasoned veterans who would not stand outside the line. It was found that constable No. 187, being new, was unfamiliar with the boundary and had interfered without cause. He was sternly admonished and ordered not to repeat the offense. The precinct expressed deep regret, offered an apology to the patrol station, and requested that the matter not be reported to higher authorities to avoid friction. The local station commander immediately agreed not to report it. It was noted that the station’s border guards were chosen for their seniority and experience so as to handle such incidents without undermining police authority or national territory. The Western constable was already reprimanded by his precinct commander upon his apology. It was therefore decided that no further action be taken against him. Guard Kong Zhaocun, who firmly asserted sovereign rights without yielding, richly deserved commendation and was to be officially praised. This order was to be communicated to all district commanders.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Murder During New Year’s Eve Feast <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Sentenced to life imprisonment</p>
<p>Pan Quanyou, a resident of Ningbo, dragged home his wife, surnamed Jiao, because she refused to attend the New Year’s Eve dinner at relatives’ house, stabbed her to death, and was arrested by the Huishan Precinct. His case was transferred to the Temporary Court for inquiry. Yesterday morning, Presiding Officer Ge opened the hearing and pronounced sentence: Pan Quanyou was given life imprisonment, and the murder weapon was confiscated. The bailiffs were ordered to take him to the western jail to await execution of the sentence.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Man Found Hanged on Rooftop Terrace <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Second landlord suspected</p>
<p>Both plaintiffs could not be summoned</p>
<p>On the rooftop terrace of the house at No. 697 Yunhe Lane, East Yalu Road, a man’s body was found hanged on the 27th of last month. The local precinct identified the deceased as Wu Shunren and sent the body to the forensic office on Felun Road, requesting the Temporary Court to conduct an autopsy and prepare for burial. At that time, the sub-landlord Guan Tiren was summoned for questioning and released for lack of involvement. Recently, two men claiming to be the deceased’s brothers, Wu Dazhi and Wu Jianyin of No. 22 Helin Lane, North Sichuan Road, jointly filed a petition with the Temporary Court, alleging suspicion on the part of the sub-landlord and requesting exhumation and examination. Presiding Officer Gao soon issued summonses for both petitioners to appear at a hearing yesterday morning at 9 a.m., when Guan and the tenants were to testify. Neither Wu Dazhi nor Wu Jianyin appeared. According to a report by Chinese Constable No. 1308 of the Harbin Precinct, summonses were served at Helin Lane but no such lane name existed; the closest address was No. 22 Renzhili, where no Wu by those names were found. Unable to effect service, the summonses were returned. Presiding Officer Gao then ruled that since the accuser Guan Tiren had already been questioned at the forensic office and no other credible evidence had emerged, and because the petitioners could not be summoned, the court could not proceed to reopen the coffin for further examination. The case was postponed pending further notice and the petitioners’ legal representatives would be informed.</p>

<p>Over 2,000 liang of opium seized</p>
<p>Value not less than 6,000 silver dollars</p>
<p>Yesterday at 3:30 p.m., a rickshaw driver, Zhang Fengxian of Jiangbei, was seen on Tiantong Road heading west with a heavily laden little cart. The No. 607 Chinese patrol officers suspected foul play, ordered him to stop for inspection, but the group escorting the cart menaced the officers. Fearing coercion, the patrol officers sounded an alarm whistle and displayed their sidearms, scattering the would-be obstructers. Nearby constables Nos. 1293 and 1299 arrived to assist, captured the escort Zhang Guiqing and Zhang Fengxian, and unloaded one of two wicker baskets on the cart, revealing opium earth in the other. The two were taken to the Hongkou Precinct, and the substance—2,160 liang—was weighed. At a market rate of three yuan per liang, its value was no less than 6,000 silver dollars. Yesterday morning, the two Zhangs and part of the contraband were sent to the Temporary Court for a hearing by Presiding Officer Wang Jianzu. According to the precinct captain, this vast quantity of opium earth belonged to an opium distributor. Their practice provided that any agent caught by authorities would, after serving his term, receive one yuan per day from the distributing company. The captain urged severe punishment as a deterrent. Under questioning, the Zhangs gave evasive answers, and Zhang Guiqing sought counsel. Presiding Officer Wang, after reviewing the testimony, sentenced Zhang Guiqing to two months’ imprisonment and a fine of 1,000 yuan, and Zhang Fengxian to two months’ imprisonment; the opium earth was confiscated.</p>

<p>Aftermath measures decided</p>
<p>At about 8 a.m. yesterday, a sudden fire broke out in the women’s dormitory of Guanghua University on Daxi Road. The blaze was fierce. University authorities urgently telegraphed the fire brigade for assistance, but due to the distance, by the time engines arrived around 10 a.m. the fire had already spread uncontrollably. Though firefighters worked vigorously, they made little headway until after 10 a.m. When the fire began, most students were in class and no lives were lost, but, with nobody on-site to salvage belongings, all furnishings were destroyed. The loss is estimated at 20,000–30,000 yuan. Afterwards, the university convened an emergency meeting and decided to vacate some classrooms to serve as temporary dormitories for the women students, relocate faculty members from their quarters, and convert those into dormitories for the remainder of the term. All classes—male and female—will resume as normal next Monday. Meanwhile, additional funds have been allocated for the construction of a new women’s dormitory.</p>

<p>According to the National News Agency, following a notice two years ago from the City Temple Firewood Industry Office increasing standard commissions by one fen, wood dealers at Xujiahui, Maple Forest Bridge, Panjiawood Bridge, and Rihui Bridge implemented the increase. However, dealers along Luban Bridge on Xielu Road, led by Wu Fuxing, charged commissions of five to seven fen. They recently cited rising expenses and higher living costs as justification for matching the official increase, though they still charged eight fen on rice straw. This was said to balance costs while showing consideration for customers. Unexpectedly, a dealer named Miao on Rihui Road sought to expand operations toward Luban Bridge, encouraging boatmen to oppose the nine-member coalition led by Wu Fuxing to raise commissions. The coalition immediately ceased supply in protest, reported the matter to the Second District Public Security Bureau, which detained Miao and ordered him to relocate his branch to avoid further disputes. It was noted that the increased commission did not exceed regulations, so their adjustment was permitted.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Report on Bandit Suppression off Wusongkou <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Naval and water-police vessels set out to rescue the Zhejiang Fisheries Bureau patrol boat Haiying—which had been seized by pirates—patrolled the East China Sea about two hundred li east of Wusongkou, but the vastness of the waters made pursuit difficult. The water police then returned to patrol near Shengshan. Meanwhile, the naval gunboat Yongsheng remained in the East China Sea in pursuit. Yesterday at about 5 p.m., five or six large sailing junks loaded with pirates were spotted in Shengshan harbor, where they were looting several fishing vessels. The Water Police Fourth District Guerrilla Unit’s patrol boat Huhan happened upon them. Its commander Wang Qingfu ordered his crew to open fire, and the pirates returned fire. After more than an hour’s engagement, several cannon shots struck the pirate vessels, which abandoned the captured fishing boats and fled separately toward the East China Sea. The chase is ongoing. In the action, the Huhan patrol boat sustained several hits and six water police officers were wounded. Shengshan’s wireless station received the news and immediately relayed it to the Wusong Fort and Coastal Defense Office. Director Wu received the report and has dispatched vessels to assist in the suppression.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Debate in the Fraud Case of Tang Zhongze of the China Fuan Life Insurance Company <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>In the Temporary Court, Tang Zhongze, Chief Supervisor of the China Fuan Life Insurance Company, is charged with embezzlement. After multiple inquiries, Presiding Officer Gao reopened the hearing in Courtroom 14 yesterday. Several new plaintiffs, including Jiang Heshou, joined, represented by counsel Fei Guodao. After a concise statement by counsel, Judge Gao questioned the defendant briefly and proceedings moved to debate. Plaintiff’s counsel He Xianzhang argued that the Shanghai branch of China Fuan had no capital of its own and no paid-in stock. Since its parent, Hong Kong Fuan, suffered losses and could not continue life-insurance operations, its insurance business was transferred to the shell entity China Fuan to exploit the Hong Kong company’s license, Shanghai address, and existing staff, deceiving policyholders. In August of the sixteenth year, the Hong Kong head office announced a liquidation in Hong Kong newspapers, but Shanghai kept collecting premiums in secret until March of the eighteenth year, when it made a public liquidation announcement while claiming that China Fuan would continue operations. Internally, the two companies were one and the same, but externally both collected premiums; any claims were attributed to the purportedly liquidated Hong Kong company, which refused to pay. Counsel Fei added that after “liquidation,” all company assets and liabilities should have been turned over to the liquidator Yi Maoli. However, in August the defendant placed a notice in the paper declaring that his duties ended with liquidation, after which he privately sold company property for over 120,000 yuan and absconded with the funds. The company’s books for the seventeenth year show that on March 27, Tang Zhongze received 95,967 liang of spare funds and repaid himself 55,967 liang—indicating embezzlement. Premium collection and disbursement entries were all in his name, with no dealings with the Hong Kong company. Thus the Shanghai entity was a sham run by the defendant to defraud policyholders. Plaintiff’s counsel Yao Jiancha, Ren Weiyu, and others also spoke. Defense counsel Wang Shang countered that there was only one company; liquidating the Hong Kong parent while not liquidating the Shanghai branch was akin to the old Northern Exchange note suspension outside Beijing, with some branches still honoring notes. Recently the Hankou branch did the same. Hence Hong Kong Fuan’s liquidation was not illegal and could not form a criminal case. If the court deemed an audit necessary, it could refer the matter to a civil tribunal, to which he had no objection. The debate lasted about three hours and was unfinished when time ran out; it was adjourned to continue on the afternoon of the 27th, with a counterclaim also under investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Judgment in the Impersonation Suit against the Zhou Huchen Brush Shop <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Wang Chunjian expresses dissatisfaction</p>
<p>Official order allows appeal by law</p>
<p>In the sixteenth year of the Republic, Yangzhou native Wang Chunjian leased the trade name of the Jiangxi branch of the Zhou Huchen Brush Shop and set up a business in Xiangfen Alley off North Stone Road in Shanghai. His brushes bore the signature “Zhou Huchen Zhengji” in addition to the shop name. In the following January, the proprietor of the original Zhou Huchen shop in Xingsheng Street, Zhou Jinyun, sued him in the Temporary Court for impersonation. Wang voluntarily abandoned his claim and closed his shop, ending the lawsuit. Last winter, Wang’s brother Wang Chunhua carried the remaining brushes to a friend’s place but was seen by Wan En from Hongkou, who confiscated them and confronted Wang on grounds of impersonation. Wang resisted and both were taken to the Second District police station, then transferred to the District Court. After preliminary examination by Prosecutor Zhu and failure to reconcile, Wan filed criminal charges for impersonation and business obstruction, while Wang defended himself in multiple hearings. Wan first submitted four brushes made by Zhou Jinyun, then two imitation order forms, claiming they were found with the brushes. Wang argued that if the forms were found simultaneously, why were they not submitted earlier, only at trial, and that they were forged. After debate concluded the day before yesterday, the court sentenced Wang to two months’ imprisonment and a fine of 100 yuan. Wang immediately expressed dissatisfaction, and the official order permits him to appeal according to law.</p>

<p>Wife’s conduct too improper</p>
<p>Yuan uses excuse to slash her five times</p>
<p>Yuan Chaoxian, age thirty-nine, a tenant on the upper floor of Lin Yongmao’s firewood shop in Yangjiashi Bridge, Zhabei, formerly ran a flower-garden business and now idled at home. His wife, Miss Fan, age thirty-four and also from Yangzhou, known for her beauty, felt embarrassed by her husband’s humble appearance and sought an illicit liaison with a fellow townsman to obtain money. Yuan discovered the affair. Yesterday at 3:30 p.m., he demanded money from his wife; when she refused, he flew into a rage, seized a kitchen knife, and slashed her lower body five times. Only one cut to her right ankle reached about one inch deep, but it bled profusely. The station guard and constables arrived and arrested Yuan and nine others, taking them to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau for processing. After a preliminary hearing by the district chief, Yuan was transferred to the judicial division for severe punishment. The injured wife was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e178">A Woman with Two Paramours <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Madame Huang Wang, a thirty-seven-year-old woman from Yancheng, claimed there was no such thing as jealousy over infidelity. Two years ago last spring, because of her husband, she came to Shanghai with her nine-year-old son Daqing and found work in a silk factory in Zhabei to make a living. Although she was no longer young, she still possessed elegant charm and could not get used to sleeping alone. She therefore entered into an affair with her fellow townsman Wu Jizhou and established their nest in Pavilion No. 7 in Chongzhen Lane off Huasheng Road on Gonghe New Road. They shared the same bed as if husband and wife. After Madame Huang began her liaison with Wu, she abandoned her silk-factory work. All her daily expenses were provided by Wu, who worked as a partner in a sauce plantation in Zhabei and earned very little each month. Madame Huang often expressed dissatisfaction, and soon she also took up with Li Along, a fellow from Changshu who was partner in a tobacco shop. Without letting either man know of the other, she went back and forth between them; for over a year they never met face to face and all was quiet. At nine o’clock one morning, Li and Madame Huang were entwined in each other’s arms asleep when Wu suddenly returned home. Bursting into the room, he lifted the curtain and was shocked to see Madame Huang lying side by side with Li. Burning with fury, he grabbed the two of them, intending to take them outside to report them to the police. But Madame Huang threw herself between him and his captives, seized his hands, and declared that both men were her paramours, that there was no issue of jealousy over infidelity, and that they could talk it over. Wu’s anger only grew upon hearing this. He then seized Li and brutally beat him. Madame Huang rushed to Li’s aid and joined in beating Wu. Overpowered by two against his one, Wu released his hold and fled outside to report the matter to the relevant police station, requesting their arrest and interrogation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Shen and Mrs. Zhang Seduce a Maiden</p>
<p>Xu Abao’s Vanity Leads to Loss of Virtue</p>
<p>Xu Shen, a forty-six-year-old woman from Songjiang, had a daughter named Abao, now eighteen years old, whose appearance was not unattractive. The previous year, they lived in their hometown, but two springs ago Madame Xu brought her daughter to Shanghai and they both worked as domestic help for a family on Shengyi Lane, No. 4 in the South City. Because the work was extremely busy, mother and daughter resigned together and later Madame Xu went to work for the Shen family on Dandongmen Tangjia Lane. But Abao, temporarily without an employer, was entrusted to a matchmaker surnamed Zhu on Huay Street to find work. One afternoon while waiting in Zhu’s shop, she was approached by her acquaintance Mrs. Shen Zhang from Pinghu, who, under the pretext of taking supper, invited Abao and two other women out to visit the Little World amusement park. There they encountered three men known to Mrs. Shen. In the course of conversation, one man surnamed Zhao became particularly intimate with Abao. After their tour ended, the group of seven went to lodge at a hotel in the North City. During that time, Zhao privately told Abao that her life as domestic help was too hard, and she would be better off living with him. He said he was employed by a foreign firm with a hefty monthly income; if she agreed, she would never worry about food or clothing again. He even promised to buy her a fashionable qipao the next day. Abao, a country girl new to Shanghai, was flattered and moved by his words and fell into his scheme. That night she shared his bed and was raped. Madame Shen slept with another man, while the remaining two women shared a bed with the third man. After the night passed, Abao and the three men arranged to meet again later and then parted. Madame Shen accompanied Abao back to the matchmaker’s shop. The matchmaker, alarmed that Abao had been out all night and had not returned, immediately notified Xu Shen, who came to the shop to question her. At first Abao, ashamed, remained silent, but after her mother pressed her repeatedly she disclosed the details. On hearing of her daughter’s prior betrothal to a man in her hometown and how she had been lured out and defiled by Mrs. Shen, Xu Shen was furious. She immediately took Abao to capture Mrs. Shen and summoned Watchman Liu Shaoqing of the Seventh Post to bring her to the First District Substation. Under preliminary questioning by the superintendent, orders were given to detain them pending further investigation.</p>

<p>Yan Lamei, a seventeen-year-old girl from Pudong, was lured and abducted to the home of An Shiqing in South Nanyang Lane, French Concession vegetable market street, where she was forcibly raped and kept. An then conspired with Song Jialin to try to sell her. The detective Wang Dongwan of the French Police Station learned of the incident and arrested An and Song. Yan Lamei was taken together into custody and brought before the French magistrate’s court for prosecution. Under interrogation, Yan Lamei stated that she had been living as a daughter-in-law in a certain household but had fled due to cruel treatment by her mother-in-law. On the road she met An, who tricked her into his home and raped her several times before conspiring with Song to sell her. Upon questioning, An Shiqing admitted to the abduction and rape but denied any intent to sell. Song Jialin testified that recently a civilian passing by An’s door had been invited inside, and at that moment the detective arrived to arrest them; he gave evasive answers to other questions. The French magistrate sentenced An Shiqing to five years in the Western jail, Song Jialin to one year as a warning to others, and ordered Yan Lamei sent to a relief shelter to await family claim.</p>

<p>Lu Baosheng, a man from Pudong working as a clerk at Changtai Rice Shop on Dou Market Street in the South City, lived at Cangqiao. His son, nicknamed Azhi, aged twenty-two, had apprenticed in the rice business but had been idle since the shop closed two years ago. He associated with ruffians and secretly pawned household items for his own use. His father repeatedly admonished him to no avail and was met with insults. Recently, Azhi began demanding money from his father and beating him when his demands were not met. Relatives, unable to bear his conduct, expelled him from the house. But Azhi continued to extort his father outside. Lu, upon receiving an apology from Azhi for his behavior, was enraged and contemplated drowning himself to avoid further burdening his family. Relatives dissuaded him. He now intends to file a formal statement with the authorities to sever all relations with his son.</p>

<p>Jiang Wenbing, a thirty-eight-year-old Zhejiang native living at No. 201 Tongqing Lane on Yuezhou Road, had formerly worked as a manager at the CSSC Jinliyuan Wharf warehouse with a substantial monthly income. During the May Third Movement sit-down strikes, he ceased working and in the ensuing years fell into financial distress. He had repeatedly contemplated suicide but was rescued each time. Recently, through a friend’s introduction he joined the Dalai Company in Pudong as a dockworker but earned very little, struggling to make ends meet. Plagued by constant worry, he secretly ingested an entire bottle of hydrogen peroxide yesterday around 5 p.m. Colleagues discovered him and immediately arranged a boat to send him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he died at 9:30 p.m. that night.</p>

<p>Hongji Rice Merchant in Shanghai, having recently purchased five hundred dan of polished rice at Wujiang Lili in the interior, hired two boats—Bao Bao and Chen As Five—to transport it to Shanghai. Chen As Five, however, was a native riverboat unfamiliar with Shanghai’s waterways, so it followed the Bao boat. Two days ago, both boats set sail with fair winds and approached the South Huangpu docks. When the wind suddenly turned strong, the Bao boat skillfully turned its rudder and sped ahead, separating by about a li from the Chen boat. Within moments, the Chen boat disappeared from view. Fearing the Chen crew’s unfamiliarity with the route, the Bao crew anchored and waited, but by sunset the Chen boat had not reappeared. At dawn the next day, they returned to the docks but found no trace of the Chen boat. Inquiring of other moored vessels, they learned that a cargo boat had capsized in Liuhang Bank due to careless navigation and wind-driven waves, and the hull could be seen just protruding above the waterline. They recognized it as the Chen boat and, as the crew on shore called for help, anchored nearby and inquired about what had happened. They were told that a delayed rudder turn amid the sudden emergency had caused the boat to capsize. Two of Chen’s crew fell into the water and were missing; another crew member was battered by the waves onto a sandbank but was rescued by a passing vessel and brought to shore, where his clothes were changed. The Bao crew took their injured colleague back aboard their boat; both were severely hurt and could not walk. The Bao boat then took them by motorcar to Shanghai for medical treatment. It was reported that Chen’s boat carried 180 dan of rice, and the loss was substantial. Salvage operations for the sunken cargo are underway.</p>

<p>Dr. Maspei, a sixty-four-year-old German dentist with over thirty years’ practice and considerable reputation in Shanghai, was famed for his fondness of drinking, often spending his days in a tipsy haze like a European Liu Ling. His residence was at No. 350 Weihaiwei Road in the Western Concession. At around 9 p.m. on the 15th of this month, the inebriated dentist left a drinking house in Hongkou and, as he made his way home on Tongfu Road, lost consciousness and strength, collapsing beside the road. Officers from the Xinzha Police Station (No. 1,263) found him, too drunk to speak, stinking of alcohol. They summoned a carriage to take him to Gongji Hospital for treatment, where he died on the afternoon of the 18th. Since his residence fell under the jurisdiction of the Jing’an Temple Police Station, that station ordered his body taken to the forensic institute on Philbin Road. Yesterday morning, Judge Luo Renji of the Provisional Court examined the body and, after convening a hearing, ruled the death a natural demise due to mental illness. Witnesses linked to the police stated that the deceased had been old and had a history of mental disorder, having fallen twice before. From his admittance to the hospital until his death, he did not speak a word. The police had no suspicion of foul play. As Dr. Maspei had no family in Shanghai, the station notified the German consulate to have his remains collected and buried by consular staff.</p>

<p>At about 3 p.m. two days ago, Municipal Bureau garbage truck No. 5552 on Beinanhe Road Bridge struck and killed a boy of about sixteen or seventeen. Yesterday the corpse was removed to the forensic institute on Philbin Road by police from the Customs House Station, and the Provisional Court appointed Judge Luo Renji to investigate. He determined the boy was run over and fatally injured by the truck. According to testimony by Inspector Zhong Lawen, the truck was traveling north when the boy dashed across the road east–west in front of it. The driver saw him, stopped the engine, but the front of the truck then hit a telegraph pole and the rear wheels ran over the boy. Witness Mei Guangfu, a clerk at Wantai Lumber, said he heard a loud noise and saw the truck hit the pole, then saw a person knocked down. The driver, Zhou Songgui, testified he was carrying garbage north from the Henan Road Bridge when the boy ran from west to east. The road was narrow and he applied the brake but could not avoid striking the pole, and the wheels then ran over the victim. He pleaded for understanding. A woman, Mrs. Chen Wang of No. 98, Lane 9, Guangyu Circle on Tiantong Road, reported that the deceased was her husband Chen Agen’s apprentice, nicknamed Little Chongming, seventeen years old; his father works at a sauce factory on Chongming Road. She could not decide on the matter and asked his father to handle it. Judge Luo ordered the body to remain at the forensic institute for three days pending relatives’ identification. If no one appears, the body will be delivered to the Pu Shan Shan Zhuang for burial. As the driver’s negligence could not be conclusively proven, he was released. Because the victim was poor, the court advised the Municipal Bureau to grant compensation.</p>

<p>Five Arrested in the French Concession</p>
<p>All Three Bandits Have Confessed</p>
<p>Near the western end of Zhangchuan Lane in the South City’s Little World area, at around 9 p.m. on the 11th of this month, a highway robbery occurred in which the victim Wang Nengwei was shot and wounded by the thieves. After the incident, Chief Qian of Precinct One in District Two immediately ordered his subordinates to intensify the search and ensure the perpetrators were apprehended. On the 17th, a tip from an informant reported that the main suspects were hiding in Room 25 of the Chunjiang Hotel at No. 309 Caishi Street in the French Concession. Acting on the tip, Chief Qian dispatched Inspectors Jiang and Qiang, along with several officers and informants. They first obtained authorization from the French Police Station to carry out the arrest. The station head then sent detectives to accompany them to the address, where they indeed arrested the suspects—three men and two women—and seized one pistol, two bullets, fourteen promissory notes, and an IOU beneath a table. They were taken to the station for temporary detention. Yesterday, Inspector Jiang presented the five suspects, along with the weapon and other items, at the French magistrate’s court. Under questioning by Chief Qian, one confessed to being named Pan Amao, 25, from Pudong, living at Yangjiazhai; another admitted to being Ai Guizhong, 31, from Zhenjiang, residing at 109 Rongsheng Lane, Xinzhaqiao; a third, Yang Chang—31, from Changzhou, residing at No. 14 Qiao Lane; and the woman identified herself as Zhang Xiaowan, 23, from Pudong, working at Lin’s. Another suspect, 31-year-old from Nanjing living at No. 21 Zhangjiabang, also confessed. All five have unequivocally admitted their crimes.</p>

<p>Chief Qian’s statements were recorded and forwarded to the judicial department for further prosecution yesterday.</p>

<p>Notice from the Social Affairs Bureau to the Pharmaceutical Industry Association</p>
<p>The city’s pharmaceutical workers petitioned the Civilian Training Conference to instruct employers to hire unemployed members of the union. The conference sent a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau, which yesterday ordered the Pharmaceutical Association to notify all drugstores to employ the unemployed workers as soon as possible in accordance with the law, and provided a list of unemployed members. The directive states: “In compliance with the Municipal Party Committee’s Civilian Training Committee letter requesting employers in the pharmaceutical industry to promptly hire unemployed union members who have passed party and government vetting, all firms should give priority to such members, in keeping with legal requirements.”</p>
<h3 id="e190">Minister Wang Advocates "Shuowen Gulin" <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Wang Gongxi, minister to Japan, is a passionate student of Chinese studies, especially philology and phonology. Having recently read Mr. Ding Fubao’s compilation "Shuowen Gulin" from Wuxi, he published an essay recommending it to scholars of philology. He notes that "Shuowen" is the oldest and most comprehensive Chinese dictionary; anyone wishing to understand character formation, ancient pronunciations, and meanings should study it. In recent Qing scholarship, textual criticism has flourished. Confucian scholars regard exegesis as the gateway to moral cultivation and therefore hold works on "Shuowen" in as high esteem as classics. Those specializing in "Shuowen" have produced countless volumes, but few could read them all. The minister had long aspired to compile a concise commentary on "Shuowen" by selecting essentials from Qing scholars, but could not complete it. Now, upon reading Mr. Ding Zhonghu’s "Shuowen Gulin," which gathers 180 works across more than 1,000 volumes from Xiao Xu to Qing scholars like Zang Yulin, and organizes and annotates every entry with cross-references, he realized his dream fulfilled by Mr. Ding’s thirty years of effort. Future scholars will greatly benefit from this compendium, saving enormous time and labor. The minister urges all with interest in classical studies to seek out this book.</p>

<p>Jurisdictional Issue Concerning Ling Runxiang</p>
<p>Hearing Postponed, Witnesses to Be Resummoned</p>
<p>After the collapse of Huamin Tobacco Company, owing substantial debts, the company engaged Lawyer Wu Chengyu to settle affairs. On March 25 last year, Wu convened a creditors’ meeting and voted to pay half of the debts in full settlement. However, Greater China Printing Company, owed 4,513 yuan, received nothing. Lawyer Yang Guoshu was retained to sue Huamin and its shareholders, including Ling Runxiang and Rong Jieqing, at the Provisional Court for full repayment. The plaintiff’s investigation located Ling at No. 158 Taihua Lane on Beijiangxi Road, but Rong’s address was unknown. The court issued summons; on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, court officers, accompanied by Lawyer Yang, went to serve Ling. A young woman inside said her husband Ling Runxiang was away. Yesterday the case was heard by Judge Ye. Ling, represented by Attorney Yan, raised a jurisdictional objection, arguing he now worked for the Public Security Bureau and resided in the Concession, so the case should be transferred. A Guangdong youth surnamed Zheng testified that the property had been transferred to Ling in November last year. Under cross-examination, Zheng’s statements proved unreliable. Judge Ye ordered the hearing postponed pending further summons of witnesses, including Ling himself, whose current address is confirmed at Beijiangxi Road where he serves in the Public Security Bureau.</p>

<p>"The Lady of the Camellias," the famous love story by Alexandre Dumas fils, has delighted readers worldwide. After Lin Qinnan’s Chinese translation, a local poet lamented "the lamentable Camellias, destroying every Chinese playboy’s soul." Unfortunately, Lin’s version was abridged and altered, losing much of the original’s charm. Last year, Mr. Xia Kangneng produced a new translation faithful to the original in fluent, elegant prose, creating a sensation among readers. A deluxe reprint is now selling briskly. "Manon Lescaut," another celebrated French romance—whose screen adaptation "Manon Lescaut" draws on it—will also soon be reprinted. Both books are published by the Spring Tide Bookstore in the Central Market on Malu Road.</p>

The boy was kidnapped onto a boat by a woman and found by sailors who reported the incident; the woman then fled.

<p>"Yin-Yang Vine," the miraculous remedy for pulmonary tuberculosis, is produced by the Eastern Pharmaceutical Company at No. 64 Songshan Road. Since its release, it has cured many lives.

If it fails, the company offers double the refund. As a result, business has been booming along Shanyin Road, with demand far outstripping supply. The price is $2 per dose or $20 per catty, and major pharmacies outside the concession also offer it on consignment.</p>

<p>Luo Yunyan</p>
<p>The League of Nations has appointed a committee to investigate and report on opium suppression in the Far East. Their mandate includes: (1) the status of opium smoking in each country consenting to this investigation; (2) each government’s performance in implementing Chapter II of the 1912 Hague Opium Convention and the 1925 Geneva Opium Convention; (3) the conditions of opium smuggling in Far Eastern countries, the difficulties of prohibition, and plans for future enforcement.</p>
<p>According to Article II of the 1925 Convention, exporting nations must first prohibit the export of raw opium to prevent the spread of opium‑related harm to consuming countries; secondly, they must intensify domestic suppression of opium smoking, aiming for total abolition within fifteen years of the final resolution of the League’s Advisory Committee on the Traffic in Opium and Other Dangerous Drugs. By this measure, the success or failure of opium suppression policies in the Far East depends almost entirely on the Committee. Hence, the Committee’s mission is both weighty and important.</p>
<p>However, we cannot help but raise doubts about the formation of this Committee and cannot but oppose its intentions. We therefore present the following points for the public’s information. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e210">The Recent Czechoslovak Literary Scene <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>In the view of most non‑Slavic peoples, the representatives of modern Czechoslovak literature are František Langer and Karel Čapek. In fact, however, this is not the case. Individually, they are indeed outstanding figures in modern Czech letters, but their influence on the broader Czech literary movement is quite limited. Since Čapek’s last play, “The Creator Adam,” received a lukewarm reception, he has only published one short‑story collection and spends most of his time gardening for amusement and writing a daily column on personalities and events for Lidové noviny (one of the Czech Republic’s leading newspapers). As for Langer, his recent comedy, “Štěpánkovy Proměny” (“The Transformation of Private Štěpánek”), has achieved considerable success, humorously portraying a hotel porter converted into a Salvation Army believer by a Salvation Army lass. Yet this play is not a truly significant work and does not match his masterpiece, “The Periphery.” Therefore, neither is a central figure on today’s Czech literary scene. Beyond them, many important Czech novelists, poets, and dramatists remain little known abroad due to the lack of translations of their works.</p>
<p>Czechoslovak literature, like the country itself, is in a period of transition. In life, commerce, literature, art, and architecture, it continues to absorb foreign cultures without yet creating its own. The book market overflows with translations of major modern works from England, America, France, Germany, Russia, and the Nordic countries. The prewar protest literature movement has lost all justification and standing. As for the new national literary movement, it has not yet taken firm root, though several clearly defined groups are creating in a modified nationalist vein. The most prominent of these is the Legionary faction, so called because its writers all served on the front lines during the Great War.</p>
<p>War has always been—and remains—a primary theme for Czech novelists. Their war narratives are not abstract but realistic accounts of the Czech army’s experiences in Russia and Serbia. The leading writers in this faction are Joseph Kopta and Jaroslav Kratochvíl. Kopta has just completed the third volume of his trilogy; the first two depict the Czechs’ harrowing battles against the Bolsheviks and their tragic march through Siberia to Vladivostok. The third volume, titled “The Third Regiment’s Return Home,” portrays the disillusionment of the troops upon returning to their newly freed homeland. Kopta’s work is highly authentic; he truly voices the soldiers. Kratochvíl, by contrast, leans more toward the artist and interpreter of events: his “The Path of Revolution” is a tragedy of the Siberian campaign. He is now writing a novel also set in Siberia, not yet fully published, but from the released portions it promises to become a truly great Czech novel.</p>
<p>To understand the multifaceted state of modern Czechoslovak literature, one must examine the personality of Jaroslav Durych. His poems, dramas, novels, essays, and pamphlets reveal his diverse nature. This Roman Catholic “enfant terrible” is a prolific writer. Having recently published the poetry collection “Peninky” (“Country Maidens”) and the novel “Na Hrach” (“On the Heights”), he followed with the three‑volume biographical novel “Bloudení” (“Error”), a detailed study of Count Wallenstein, the famed general of the Thirty Years’ War.</p>
<p>Karel J. Beneš’s novel “Rudé Léto” (“Red Summer”) is the first installment of an epic work depicting an entire era, aimed at portraying postwar Czech society in its entirety. “Red Summer” reaches up to the summer of 1920, when the Bolsheviks threatened the Czechoslovak border; the panic and confusion in Czech society at that time are vividly portrayed. Emil Vachek is also a prolific author, artist, and journalist, renowned as a naturalist best at writing gritty realist novels about life at society’s lowest levels. His recent novel “Parasites” provides a detailed portrayal of the lives of postwar social parasites. Jaroslav Maria likewise writes about social life, focusing on pessimistic and pathological studies, evident in his three‑volume novel “Orlové a Stržílci” (“The Eagle and the Wren”). A. Longen’s novel “Herečka” (“Actress”) is of great value to those interested in Czech art and theater life, as it tells the story of his wife, a modernist actress. These are all important novelists.</p>
<p>As for literary criticism—especially of the scholarly variety—Czechoslovakia is by no means lacking. Since the death of the country’s greatest poet, Otakar Březina, Czech criticism has become lively. Many books have been published studying and appreciating this great poet. The two most noteworthy are “Conversations on Otakar Březina,” one by Mrs. Pjickova Saupkova, Březina’s best German translator and wife, and the other by Jakub Deml, a key figure in the Czech Catholic revival and close friend to poets. The recorded conversations of these poets are full of interest and expressive power. In the current critical arena, František Goetz is the most important representative of the Czech youth; he will soon publish a collection of critiques titled “Tvar Století” (“The Face of the Age”) discussing the main tendencies of contemporary writers. Karl Tiege is the sharpest and most intelligent theorist of the radical modernist movement in literature and art; he has two new works: “On Humor, Clowns, and Dadaists” and “Modern Architecture in Czechoslovakia.”</p>
<p>Modern poetry is wholly lyrical, and is being pursued entirely by a group of young writers. Prewar veterans have either died or ceased writing. In Czech poetry the French influence is very evident. Among the younger poets there are no truly great figures; comparatively, Vítězslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert, and Hora are the most important.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Stimulation Beauty and Dissonance Beauty <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Ri Kui</p>
<p>(In every era and every social stratum, at each stage of its historical development, people have discovered and created various forms of beauty. Sometimes what they unearthed was the beauty of the human figure, the beauty of still life; at other times it was the beauty of heroic tragedy, erotic beauty, even the beauty of the monstrous. Some of these beauties vanished with their era; others transformed their appearance. Today, the beauties of the metropolis and of machinery are reflected in modern art.)</p>
<p>(The above passage is quoted from a discussion in “The Search for New Artistic Forms,” by the Japanese expert on proletarian literary theory, Kura Hara Koreto (藏原惟人). It is introduced here as this article’s opening statement, to indicate that the criterion of beauty lies in its mobility. Especially in modern literary and artistic works, beyond extolling the beauties of city life and machinery, we have lately discovered stimulation beauty, dissonance beauty, barbaric beauty, and even the beauty of Black civilization, and so forth. Putting aside for the moment the “beauty of barbarism” and the “beauty of Black civilization,” let us first examine the issues of stimulation beauty and dissonance beauty.)</p>
<p>The standard of beauty is dynamism rather than fixed immutability. Whether its shifts are gradual or precipitous, in sum there is no absolutely fixed criterion of beauty.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, beauty may be divided into two main types: active beauty and static beauty. The former advances by engaging with existing life; the latter is governed solely by the human mind and heart. Among active beauties, none is more vivid and vigorous than stimulation beauty. Its intensity is the most fiery, truly the apex of modern beauty.</p>
<p>Eastern life and thought have always valued stability and tranquility; thus in their arts they have confined themselves to static beauty. Western life and thought inherit the traditions of Greek art and culture; hence everything strives toward fervor and upheaval. Their aesthetic ideal of life is extreme fluctuation and unrest; their art’s beauty is keen sensitivity and stimulating sharpness.</p>
<p>Putting aside now the abstract, hollow lecturing-style text,</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>we turn to concrete evidence demonstrating how stimulation beauty affects modern life.</p>
<p>Open any daily newspaper and one third of it is taken up by full‑page cinema advertisements. A survey of the films showing at Shanghai’s more than thirty theaters finds that not a single one fails to tout slogans like “Romantic Carnality” or “Alluring Stimulation.” After all, going to the movies represents a type of modern stimulating life: for a modest sum, in one or two hours you can witness countless stirring, tragic, hilarious or poignant life tableaux. Tell me, of the audience seated before the silver screen, who does not go in search of spiritual excitement and neural stimulation?</p>
<p>Consider too the wildly popular football matches, horse races, and dog races—these frenzied sports that embellish metropolitan life. Which of them does not offer its own thrilling stimulus?</p>
<p>With coffeehouses and dance halls mushrooming everywhere, it need hardly be said that they are all intensely stimulating venues. Garden‑style tea salons and halls for storytelling accompanied by singing will gradually be phased out. What is now in vogue is the Café‑Restaurant, where charming young women serve and Jazz music delivers rapid, forceful melodies, accompanied by lively, wind‑swept dance stars. In short, every enjoyment in life today expresses active beauty and stimulation beauty.</p>
<p>Now a few words on dissonance beauty. Past art and aesthetic standards favored harmony and equilibrium as their two great characteristics. Since the collapse of feudalism, classical‑school art has likewise become bankrupt. Modern artists cannot enjoy an ordered, stable life; none have leisure to labor over works of harmony and balance. Thus dissonance beauty emerged in art at just the right moment.</p>
<p>When an artistic culture reaches full ripeness, it gradually leans toward dissonance—this is a natural phenomenon in historical progress.</p>
<p>Classical music’s essence is harmony; modern music has taken a different course, favoring chaotic cacophonies. It casts aside traditional compositional rules and introduces the savage, stimulating strains of folk melodies. This is one of the chief manifestations of dissonance beauty in modern art.</p>
<p>In painting, refined color palettes have been abandoned in favor of pure primary hues—crimson, azure, yellow, white, black—colors rich with intense stimulation, eagerly used by contemporary painters. In women’s fashion, too, we see the surging power of pure, stimulating hues: black velvet cheongsams, flesh‑colored stockings, pale foundation powders, dark brows, vivid rouges—all reveal a trend toward simplification, stimulation, and thus dissonance beauty.</p>
<p>The most conspicuous examples of dissonance beauty in women’s adornment are three fashionable trends: bobbed hair, bare feet, and the half‑stocking craze that swept the winter season.</p>
<p>Those who study modern art must in no way overlook these two great tendencies of stimulation beauty and dissonance beauty.</p>
<p>This is the conclusion of this essay.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Biography Literature in Demand <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>

<p>Recent Trends in Publishing</p>
<p>Lately the publishing world has seen a strong preference among general readers for works recounting the experiences and merits of great figures and celebrities. Next in popularity are light‑interest pieces in general news magazines—discussions of fathers, tributes to husbands, introductions to a wife’s half‑concealed life. Autobiographies and critical biographies of modern famous industrial magnates and politicians—such as Edison, Wanamaker, Ford, and Mussolini—are published in abundance, and their readership grows daily. Recent plans to reserve publication space for Baroudack’s heroic biographies, and Mr. Sugimori Kōjirō’s manuscript on the social significance of hero worship in the new era, are ironclad proof of the modern public’s hero‑worship fervor.</p>
<p>The distinctive feature of biographical literature is its grounding in the real life circumstances of its subjects. When introducing a certain type of figure, it fully recounts the era and spirit from which that person arose. Thus, by reading biographies of great and heroic individuals from ancient times to the present, one can gain insight into world history. Conversely, having a grasp of world history allows one to understand fully the deeds of these great worthies. Young readers who find biographies engaging do so because they help them master a wealth of social knowledge and cultivate elevated sentiments. In Europe and America, collections of anecdotes about statesmen and soldiers from the World War, supplemented with causes of the war and impressions, are published as biographical literature. In lands ravaged by war, reconstruction of society and the revival of industry everywhere demand the efforts of a conscious populace. The emotional and intellectual stimulus that readers receive from biographies of these great personages is not hard to imagine. In our recent age of democratically minded crowds and group consciousness, the sudden surge in hero worship may seem, at first glance, like a chronological misstep. Yet seeing that many of the populace prepare to adopt the thoughts and achievements of past heroes as the guiding lights for forging a new life, one can readily understand this phenomenon with a clear conscience.</p>
<p>Moreover, as everyone’s life becomes more mechanized and ordinary, their psychological longing for heroic achievements grows ever more unbreakable. Consider the United States, which achieved independence not long ago and seeks to excel in everything; this is but another aspect of the foregoing psychology.</p>

<p>Chapter 37: Victorian‑Era Poetry</p>
<p>Looking back at Victorian poetry, we are astonished at its richness—even before we have named specific works. Yet without the greater siblings who ennobled literature—those poets better known as humorists than as poets, who wrote only three or four complete songs; poets like Thomas Hood; those who introduced Celtic magic, such as the Irish “Dark Rosaline” poet Mangan; poets like Clough, a friend of Arnold, who wrote sparse but truly lyrical poems; Covendry Patmore, author of tear‑jerking “Toy”‑like verses; Sidney Dobell, who wrote a beautiful vesper hymn before the advent of “free verse”; longer poems often in dialect, and short lyric pieces in classical English that, in thought, feeling, originality of courage, and melodic structure, were notable, such as those by island poet Thomas Edward Brown; and the brisk verse writers Landor and Dobson, among others.</p>
<p>From the late nineteenth century into the early twentieth century, there arose young poets who maintained the great tradition of English balladry while clearly adding individual tunes of life and death. To enumerate all their names is impossible. Among them were Oscar Wilde, author of the powerful “Ballad of Reading Gaol”; John Davidson, confirmed writer of robust folk songs; William B. Yeats, gifted with Celtic enchantment; A. E. Housman, whose “To an Athlete Dying Young” offers proof that a poet’s greatness cannot be measured by volume alone; John Masefield, master of lyric verse and adventure tales; W. B. Yeats; and others. The glory of English poetry persists not only in great solo voices but also in the chorus of smaller songsters—each a soloist—since poets are not choristers. Even in this brief outline, though unnamed, their works could form a fine anthology of beautiful poems.</p>
<p>There is consensus among living poets that the name Francis Thompson stands as the crowning peak of nineteenth‑century verse. He is not the last great English poet—there is no such thing here and there ought not to be—but we may, if not on critical grounds then on poetic grounds, regard him as a magnificent sunset and place the rich illusions of his “Sunset Hymn” upon his own brow:</p>
<p>Ah, you exiled sun,</p>
<p>Withdrawing each day your splendor!</p>
<p>How grand was your oriental rising!</p>
<p>Now you set in more august beauty,</p>
<p>Your peal resounds in heaven’s tumult,</p>
<p>Your cymbals thunder the western sky ablaze.</p>
<p>How composedly you die!</p>
<p>I but see your brass‑bright horns resound.</p>

<p>The films of comedic king Harold Lloyd have long delighted Shanghai audiences, but a talking picture has been lacking—until now. By sparing no expense, the Paramount Company in America has shipped “Laughing in the Face of Death,” Lloyd’s first full‑dialogue release, to our shores. He plays a youthful botanist turned amateur detective, whose mishaps are uproariously comic and whose resourceful agility astonishes as he darts about like a dragon flying with precision.

<p>World News Agency, Washington—The Atlantic shipping lanes long dominated by Britain and Germany have, over recent years, seen the U.S. actively expand its maritime power to compete with the Anglo‑German United Mail Steamship Company. A major shipbuilding plan has just been announced: two liners of over 50,000 tons each, 962 feet in length, and capable of 28 km/h—unmatched by any current vessels. Each will cost about US$30 million, and their internal appointments will rival the finest ocean‑liners for luxury, approaching land‑based hotel standards. Most noteworthy is their war‑ship–style construction, allowing rapid conversion into fully equipped warships if needed. Britain’s naval supremacy rests not on sheer quantity of warships but on its fleet of merchant vessels convertible to warships. Now the U.S. pursues the same strategy with these new liners—no mystery as to their purpose.</p>
<h3 id="e218">New York’s Tallest Buildings <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>New York’s tallest and most solidly built structure is the Chrysler Building, with seventy‑five floors and 850 feet in height. Yet the Empire State Building under construction on the old site of the Waldorf‑Astoria Hotel will be greater and taller: eighty‑five floors, about 970 feet high. In a few months, work will begin on The National City Bank &amp; Farmers Trust Co. Building, a seventy‑one‑story, 925‑foot tower. Meanwhile, Metro‑Bolton Life Insurance Company plans a 100‑story tower near Madison Square, though its final height remains undecided. Finally, the Lefcourt Building, destined to be New York’s next tallest, is planned for Times Square at 1,050 feet.</p>
<p>Many engineers have opined that buildings should not exceed forty stories, yet today seventy‑ and eighty‑story structures are no novelty. In the coming years, a new record of one‑hundred‑story buildings may well be set; decades hence, towers over a hundred stories could become commonplace.</p>
<p>This is an undeniable fact: the drive to build taller stems not from engineering convenience but from economic factors. In New York City, land costs over US$200 per square foot—an astounding figure.</p>

<p>Amid rising gold prices, the world’s monetary situation warrants close attention, especially that of the United States, deemed the world’s wealthiest nation. By the end of September 1929, its national banks held US$4,008 million—an astonishing sum by Chinese standards. China’s economy lies largely in foreign hands, and in 1929 imports of raw silver reached 13.667 million ounces, driving domestic silver prices to a disastrous low. To assess whether China’s silver slump resulted from over‑production, we consult the latest seventeen‑year comparison report from the U.S. Mint on gold and silver coinage.</p>
<p>According to the Mint’s January 15 report, the seventeen-year comparison of gold coinage:</p>
<p>1929: US$43,990,200</p>
<p>1928: US$46,165,400</p>
<p>1927: US$45,418,600</p>
<p>1926: US$49,860,200</p>
<p>1925: US$52,277,000</p>
<p>1924: US$51,734,000</p>
<p>1923: US$48,849,200</p>
<p>1922: US$50,067,200</p>
<p>1921: US$51,186,900</p>
<p>1920: US$60,333,400</p>
<p>1919: US$68,646,700</p>
<p>1918: US$83,750,070</p>
<p>1917: US$93,509,030</p>
<p>1916: US$101,033,700</p>
<p>1915: US$94,531,800</p>
<p>1914: US$88,884,400</p>
<p>1913: US$93,345,150</p>
<p>1912: US$93,509,030</p>
<p>From this seventeen‑year span, 1929’s output was the lowest, and 1915’s the highest.</p>
<p>The seventeen‑year comparison of silver coinage:</p>
<p>1929: US$33,540,678</p>
<p>1928: US$34,200,567</p>
<p>1927: US$34,263,328</p>
<p>1926: US$39,136,496</p>
<p>1925: US$45,911,864</p>
<p>1924: US$43,822,814</p>
<p>1923: US$60,134,839</p>
<p>1922: US$38,206,114</p>
<p>1921: US$33,485,109</p>
<p>1920: US$60,801,955</p>
<p>1919: US$63,533,652</p>
<p>1918: US$66,485,529</p>
<p>1917: US$59,078,100</p>
<p>1916: US$48,953,000</p>
<p>1915: US$37,397,300</p>
<p>1914: US$40,067,770</p>
<p>1913: US$40,348,100</p>
<p>1912: US$39,197,500</p>
<p>Over the seventeen years, silver output in 1929 was also the lowest, with only 60.937 million ounces of pure silver coined. Thus the contraction in U.S. gold and silver coinage significantly impacts national wealth.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Both Russia and Italy Pay Attention to Sericulture <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>The Soviet government, in order to prepare for the revitalization of the silk industry, recently sent Mr. Khupykhaer, director of the Turkestan State Silk Industry Corporation, to Japan to investigate sericulture. It is reported that in that country the silk industry in southern Russia shows more promise, with annual cocoon outputs of 8,000,000 kg in the Caucasus, 2,000,000 kg in Ukraine, and 15,000,000 kg in Turkestan, totaling 35,000,000 kg. Of this, about 6,000,000 kg are exported to Italy. It is now planned to adopt Japanese-style rearing methods in southern Russia, organized as the Kashmir government in India has done: the government distributes silkworm eggs to farmers, who may purchase them at a very low fixed price, thereby reducing production costs. The aim is to capture the Central European market and become the world’s second‑largest sericulture nation.</p>
<p>From Rome it is reported that, in order to increase domestic wheat yields and expand the silk industry, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, in view of the Soviet plan mentioned above, is expected to formulate incentive measures rewarding anyone producing as much as 58 kg of cocoons, thereby setting a new national record for sericulture. Cocoon output last year increased by 1,000,000 kg over the previous year. Going forward, it is intended to rear silkworms also in summer and autumn, with the aim of increasing output by 10,000,000 kg. The achievements of recent years are as follows (unit: kilograms):</p>
<p>1929</p>
<p>Cocoons: 53,348,835</p>
<p>Raw silk: 4,830,000</p>
<p>1926</p>
<p>Cocoons: 4,231,000</p>
<p>Raw silk: 3,885,000</p>
<h3 id="e221">Intelligence Testing of Cats and Dogs <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Students in the Animal Psychology Department of Columbia University have conducted intelligence tests on cats. This year the university will open a spacious new experimental laboratory in Schermerhorn Hall, comprising nine rooms and equipped with an experimental zoo housing dogs, cats, mice, birds, monkeys, and other animals for testing purposes. According to the laboratory’s director, Professor Wharton, intelligence tests on kittens will continue, and it is hoped that the experimental work will be intensified this year.</p>
<p>The results of the feline intelligence tests indicate that wild cats are more intelligent than pet domestic cats. The testing method employs two specially made wire cages, one large and one small, with the small cage placed inside the larger. Milk is placed in the small cage, and to obtain it the cat in the large cage must overcome the obstacle between them. Some cats learn to go around the barrier, while others do not; some are faster, others slower, and their differences in intelligence are judged by their speed.</p>
<p>In addition to this test, more difficult experiments are underway. When comparing the intelligence of various animals, Wharton says that the dogs tested in France by Mr. Xuefu are the most intelligent animals. Dogs can learn many tricks and perform complex sequences of actions, which other species cannot. (Rhyme)</p>
