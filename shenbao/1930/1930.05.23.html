<h3>自己肅清之運動</h3>
<p>甘地致美國書。謂此次之運動。非抵抗之運動。乃自己肅清之運動。如禁酒則先自戒飲。並從檢查酒店入手。抵制外布。則先自不外布。並從推廣土布入。手。此種自己肅清之運動。出乎各人之本心。基乎各人之自由。非他種任何外力所能干涉而阻制。此誠世界最强大之力量。而亦無論何國人所同具者也。惟各國之人。雖具此力量。而每自放棄之。即有人激於一時之憤慨。偶然覺悟非用此自己肅清之策劃不可。然而人心不能齊一。精神不能團結。氣力不能持久。則肅清之效未見而先自不能支持。外力未加壓迫。而自己先巳畏退。此自己肅清之運動。所以終於無成也。今印度人之從事此項運動可謂歷久不衰。先施於鹽。次及於其他各類。凡我自身分内能力所及者。無不本此偉大之精神。以實施此肅清自巳之工作。雖屢經重大之壓抑與阻撓。而其運動。旣不出乎自巳範圍以外。則人亦將莫可如何。是故自巳肅清運動之意義。較之非武力抵抗之意義。尤爲明確而正大也。</p>
<p>世界無論何事。肅清自巳之一步爲最難。即極小之事。尙且不易。况乎獨立運動之所謂肅清。包括若是之鉅哉。印人之責任。亦甚重大矣。</p>

<h3>一得之言·秋·水</h3>
<p>雖然一個男子巳由衷地把他心的　匙給了一個女子。而和伊結了婚了。可是他仍希望伊把他的心門開後。不要隨手關閉。</p>
<p>有幾種丈夫。眞好像某種舊樣的飾品棄之可惜。劉之無用。女人們不知要怎樣的去處置他才好。只有照舊的把這種舊樣飾品戴了起來。這不是他的價值可貴。只因爲對他曾有一度深的感情之故。</p>
<p>情塲如戰塲。而情塲的變幻。却更比戰塲爲甚。當一個男子自誓不願再見伊而惘惘然深夜返家之後。他的心裏京很明白。呼呼地睡去了。可是一到第二天的早晨醒來了以後。却又在記念着伊爲什麽竟沒有電話來問訽。</p>
<p>男子們常是這樣予盾。十分鐘前他自誓不再和别的女人發生關係。而十分鐘以後。却又顧影自憐。覺得獨身之寂寞哩　　已入情網中的男子。不能吃不能睡也不能工作。除非等到他有一天的早晨忽然自己警覺巳經愛上的一個女子。而决定抛棄了他的愛的競爭的時候。</p>
<p>女子的性格。可以算得是世界上之最柔和者了。但是當伊聽見了伊的舊戀結婚後很不滿意的消息的時候。倒也不能自制伊心裏所感覺着的一點兒滿足和得意。</p>
<h3>顧鶴逸·覺·迷</h3>
<p>吳門顧鶴逸氏。於本月十七日逝世矣鶴逸蓋爲當代一大畫手。畫家之中。去年喪一吳觀岱。今又喪一顧鶴逸。噩耗傳來。不勝歎息。爲作小史。刋之本談。</p>
<p>鶴逸。姓顧氏。名麟士。字西津。鶴逸爲其别字。吳門人。元畫家黄子久别號一峯山人。鶴逸取此故事。别號一峯亭長。其畫無所師承。而能登峯造極者。則由其家藏豐富。臨摹工深所致也。蓋顧氏爲吳中望族。昔年吳門大紳顧紫珊者。即爲其祖。紫珊豪於資財。酷好金石書畫。收藏之富。冠絶一時。其藏名人書畫之箑。至有萬柄。築萬箑樓以藏之。其他亦可想而知矣。且紫珊雅好賓客。於閶門護龍街。就前明人吳匏菴宅舊址。築爲怡園。延納名公鉅卿。評量金石書畫。當時大金石家如吳清卿輩。大書畫家如吳昌碩陸廉夫輩。每每流連其間。至以怡園爲評量金石書畫之地。因之紫珊蓄藏金石書畫。多由吳清卿輩爲之審定。所蓄藏書畫。著錄於烟雲過眼錄者。不特富絶一時。抑且精絶一時。而當時各地書畫家之至吳門者。紫珊每相延納。居停怡園之中。近代畫家如顧若波。如胡三橋。如吳秋農。如倪墨耕。如山陰諸任。蓋俱黨時怡園門客鶴逸旣與當代各畫家爲友。互相切磋。又以前代諸畫家爲師。日相規橅。故畫無帥承。能於畫理心領神會。窮極奥妙。昔年吳漁山得一黄子久畫幅。奉之爲師。至成清初一代大家。鶴逸家藏畫幅。旣於宋元諸家。無家不備。無家不精。是亦無怪其成爲當代一大畫手矣。鶴逸之畫曩與陸廉夫齊名。廉夫於山水花卉人物仕女。無所不擅。其於山水花卉尤所擅長。鶴逸則專畫山水。論者謂廉夫花卉。實得南田嫡派。一時無與抗手。鶴逸山水。則俐南宋眞傳。蓋亦無與抗手。余所觀得鶴逸之畫。其撫宋元諸家。無不得其神似。誠爲一大畫手。廉夫沒已多年。鶴逸今又云亡。可勝惜哉。</p>
<h3>垃圾島·嵇·覲</h3>
<p>紐約密西西必河之南。有一小島。面積約數十里。名曰喬克辣斯。相傳係垃圾堆積而成。緣河面廣闊两岸均爲紐市繁盛之區。一年傾入之垃圾。多至一萬四千餘噸。乃自一八九一年以迄今日。層積累疊。漸露水面。草木生之。禽獸居之。幾與平常島嶼無一。見者莫不嘖嘖稱奇。</p>
<p>考島之成因。半屬地理上發生重大之變化。成爲海水所侵蝕。或爲土地所昇降。從未有由人工之構造者。即如珊瑚蟲類。善在海底營生。銜沙運土。逐漸隆起而爲島嶼。南洋有之。亦不多見。惟此島面積雖不甚大。然歷年增加。謂可與陸地相接。且其土用肥沃内含琉硝甚富。所植之物易以滋長。此亦足見世無棄物而地有餘利者也。</p>
<h3>醫院放毒之案中案·璧·人</h3>
<p>邇日廣州喧傳一醫院女僕被人下毒謀殺一案。事頗離奇。極爲當局所注意。緣有順德人名黄孟彞者。在廣大路四十七號自辦青春醫院。營西醫事業。只門診而無留醫。闔家祗黄與妻馮氏及女僕三人。</p>
<p>本月二日。女僕阿二早餐後。忽在廚房倒地。面青白。口吐鮮血。呼吸停止。黄即疑爲中毒。遂着手查騐。該寓約七八丈深。後通壬癸坊。左有空地在建築中。窗户常開。貫以鐵枝。黄與妻住第三房。女僕等則居於最後一房。後察覺黄所居之房内帳枕。有水痕。似從窗外射入。遂將帳枕煎水化騐。騐得含有毒藥名藍酸。毒性最烈。</p>
<p>該事發生後黄遂被傳赴公安局。當局質詢之下。黄以無仇人對。乃有一事。最可疑者。當此案未發生之前一夜十二時及三時。有人連次敲門。請看急症。問爲何人介紹。病狀若何。地址何在。均支吾以對。黄却之。翌晨遂發生是案焉。</p>
<p>中毒女僕。年二十三。略具姿色。而未字人。在黄處巳七八年。平日頗謹愼從事。今忽中毒。殊爲可惜云。聞數日前。該院亦有一貓同樣暴斃。刻當局以事屬離奇。案中有案。着令長警嚴查云。</p>
<h3>大千之投筆紀念展覽會·賀·天·健</h3>
<p>今日海上之有二張。不亞昔日洛陽之有二陸。二妙千古。輝光相映。此畫苑之盛事也。善孖世號虎痴。以善畫虎稱。其實山水人物以及花卉草蟲無所不精。大千有石濤再生之號。蓋一落筆。風雷挾走。非石濤不足擬。石濤乎。大千乎。撲朔迷離。未可識别也。此日大千何以以投筆聞。其間蓋有由矣。大千自以書畫問世以來。踵門求墨者。幾無日無之。所謂鐵限爲穿。誠非虚語。惟大千賦性洒落。疎俟不覊。興之所至。涉律成畫。而求之者每以尺度篇幅限之。大千頗以爲苦。蓋有時欲作大畫。而必限之以小。有時欲作小畫。而必限之以大。大小固不足拘而左右擁積。畫債成臺由是興爲之限而趣爲之殺矣。故大千常與余語曰。大丈夫何事不可爲。必奴隸我於筆墨問乎。蓋欲投筆者屢矣。當去年大千浮海東遊。北往瀋陽大連朝鮮北平而歸。而其家中索畫之件。巳有百十之數。所幸者山川眼前。風雲腕底。造化粉本。性靈抒寫。適亦盈篋。經年畫債。足以相抵。於是而奮然曰。吾復忍爲楮筆奴隸乎。投筆之事乃實現矣。其師曾丈農髯聞而與語曰。子名已成。一旦投筆。不可無紀念於是乎有紀念展覽會之舉。事聞於吾。慨然而言曰世方以不得名爲苦。而大千旣得名。乃望望然而去之。大千其將何爲乎。楮墨奴隸。固非吾男兒事也。然而敝屣名利。大千誠非常人所及矣聞會址在寗波同鄉會。展覽之件可百餘幅。善孖與大千合作扇面及所作十二金釵等妙品。亦並參列。於二十一日開始展覽。吾畫界自有歷史以來。成名而去者。鮮有所見。大千此舉。蓋空前之事矣。豈可不紀念哉。爰作此文以紀之。</p>
<h3>截髮旗袍之西洋美人·履·冰</h3>
<p>前日余以事由下關入城在半邊街口。覩前面有黄包車二乘。飛馳而來。佇立路旁。以待其過。始見坐車上者。非我國人及西洋婦女也。婦之一。年事約四十餘。面目慈藹。似宣敎中人。所異者挽髮作髻。並御灰色綢製大襟之衣。下圍玄裙。粗望之似難辨别。但面目膚色。固處處顯露其爲外籍也。偶舉以詢友人。謂此婦京人知之頗審。來華傳敎十餘年。爲女牧師中之前輩。能操華語絶流利。喜中裝之舒適。故平居恒見其不穿西服云。並據友談。近來玄武湖邊。清凉山畔。好游覽者。徘徊其間。每遇若干西洋少婦。雙瞳蔚碧。膚色白皙。效時下裝束。截髮旗袍。式樣窈窕。别具風韻。客有向其作劉楨之平視者。伊亦落落大方。絶無羞澀神態。或傳西婦中裝。類多留學生眷屬。奉職首都。故伴夫偕來。以居華久。耳濡目染。遂亦華化。斯實不足爲奇。不過西洋女子之旅華者。確有漸嗜我國女裝之傾向。誌之。要亦一時佳話也。</p>
<h3>洪都别載徐·澄·宇</h3>
<p>各省皆有地諱。江相則號曰老表。而臘鷄之名尤古。明李時嘗以「臘鷄獨擅江西味」戲夏貴溪。貴溪立應曰「響馬能空冀北羣」。蓋李北平人。響馬其地諱也。嚴分宜當權日。逢初度。其鄉人往致賀。分宜固魁梧。長身聳立。諸人俯身趨謁。高中玄旁睨而笑。分宜問故。中玄曰。偶憶韓昌黎詩。大鷄昻然來。小鷄竦而待。以失笑耳。衆亦哄堂。然俚語相沿。不知何始。贛人某元夕燈詞云。瓔珞繽紛五色迷。看燈人到十三齊。鄉人相見頻相問。何故吾鄉號臘鷄。</p>
<p>江右有租妻之風。富室之無子者。輒向貧民租一能産婦。期以年月。計時出資。時至不問産子與否。即隨本夫歸去。略無留戀之色或以産子爲期。子産即去。或貧民無以爲生。輒率其妻求租於富室之子。或迫於債。即使其妻從債主去。及期而還。近年雖由省縣嚴禁。而僻陋之鄉。未能絶也。</p>

<p>原來一個人傷風感冒而咳嗽。這是常有之事。。不足爲奇。。咳嗽或是咳得很厲害。。因受寒而起。。過一回兒就好了。。但是柳星叔的咳嗽。是一種不徹底的咳嗽。。只一種輕聲而隨便的咳嗽。。俗語謂之「半聲頭咳嗽。。」那種咳嗽。。便是肺病的現象。。這必定是他的肺裏有了故障。。然後發出這個咳嗽聲音。。他的肺裏覺着有些兒作癢。。或者帶毛。。他纔喉管裏發出這個咳嗽聲來。。自己往往不大覺得。。人家却聽得很清楚。。左詩晨看看柳星叔的两腮帶赤。。他想星叔的肺病很深。。只怕巳到了第二三期了。。但是他自己還是天天到書局。。天天到報館。。决不曠一天課。。左詩晨也不好說什麽。。惟有勸他自己葆養身體。。有節勞的地方。。還是自己節勞爲宜。。古云。。留得青山在。。不怕無柴燒。。太勞苦了。。却是有傷軀體。。柳星叔道。。你的話。。我深爲感激。。我也未嘗不想節勞。。無如我的環境不許我節勞。。這也是沒法事。。停了一回兒道。。我想一個人是賤的。。有一年。。我曾經三個月不做事。。只隨便拿一本書看看。。却也就這樣頺廢下去。。那時身體反覺得懶洋洋。。悶昏昏。。也不見得比現在怎樣好。。此刻一日到夜。。一點兒沒有空閑的時刻。。也便這樣一天天過去了。。有人說。。人的腦筋。。也和機器一般。。要每日開動的。。倘然廢棄不用。。那腦筋也似機器一樣的要生銹了。。又笑着向左詩晨道。。我的偵探小說。。已譯成了百分之九十了。。再有十天。。便可以殺青了。。這一千塊錢。。却是意外的。。從天外飛來的。。雖然熬了這許多夜。。可是由我自己力作所得的。。好似一個工匠。。製成了一樣東西。。自己似乎很得意呢。。這一千塊錢的用途。。我巳支配好了。。這本是在預算之外的。。我想全用在購買一些首飾之類。。凡是年輕的女人。。都是喜歡珍寳作裝飾品。。這也是愛好天然。。最普通的事。。况且他們方家的小姐。。出來雖然不能說怎樣的珠圍翠繞。。也得有幾樣過得去的裝飾品。。現在的娶夫人。。又和從前不同了。。從前討了一位夫人。。藏在家裏。。可以永遠不露面。。不給人家看見。。現在可不成了。。人家請客。。往往把夫人一同請了。。不能不帶了夫人一同去。。那末許多的夫人在那裏比賽。。漂亮的夫人。。人人注目。。好像做丈夫的與有榮施。。不漂亮的夫人。。老實不客氣。。便比下去了。</p>

<h3>棉市頺勢難挽</h3>
<p>昨日美棉來電漲跌互見、本埠棉市疲軟形勢平淡無神、本月份日商交貨、收户缺乏、故形勢愈虚、跌風益熾、惟漢帮及散户拉緊遠期、始終不肯放鬆、惟某廠商對於十月份依然抛賣做空、且包額殊巨、現棉生意、則頗形清淡也、</p>
<p>近期交貨充斥漢標前市開盤、以買方拉緊而堅、惟本月份交貨者充斥於市塲、疲跌五分遠月漲一錢、午後市氣驟鬆、買户缺乏、跌五分至一錢、全日成交統計二萬七千五百担茲將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>絲茶武進西鄉新繭巳上市</h3>
<p>武進各市鄉、今歲地方萑苻不靖、農民對於春繭不敢多育、西鄉繭事較東鄉益形遜色、更兼天時惡劣、早晚繭咸受影響西鄉新繭已上市、東鄉亦已上簇、潞城·三河口厚餘·孟河·奔牛一帶繭行、定今日開秤東鄉二十四五日亦當見新、繭價看高六十元、攺良種優繭酌加、預計武邑今歲繭産、統扯至多不過四五成云、</p>
<h3>提高抑低之洋莊茶市</h3>
<p>祁茶暴漲念兩···成交二千七百餘箱昨日本埠洋莊茶市、英莊怡和·恊和·天裕、錦隆等行、對於祁門高莊紅茶進意益趨濃厚、所到之貨、幾無停留、市勢頗有扶搖直上之概、全市成交共達二千七百四十七箱、市價開至二百二十五兩、貨價平均比較照前日又漲二三十兩、惟温州、河口等路低莊紅茶及路莊土莊綠茶、洋茶商極少問及、提高抑低之茶市、已成自然之趨勢云、</p>
<h3>祁浮三字茶市價傾下</h3>
<p>祁浮紅茶、頭二字均經各號進辦、不虞滯銷三字茶山户亦齊帮採製、上莊對售、奈茶號現洋缺乏、不能多進自浮屬榴口匪刧茶欵案最生多不敢赴景辦洋、河口茶司未到之號、大半臨時收塲、茶銷因之滯减、兼之祁門米價飛漲、每元四升半、各號茶司工人、均苦無食度日、故多縮短時期、咸主少進、近日祁浮三字紅茶、市價巳傾跌二十元、尤鮮人問津、茶市前途、頓見黯淡云、</p>
<h3>糧食米市銷胃略活</h3>
<p>大盤以鮮貨最堅</p>
<p>閘北昨日裏路來源不滿十號、市銷轉活、緣天宮稍晴、各店亟須略進、北粳買氣趨爽、但須新鮮之粳最佳、行情好起角許、宿粳無榮辱之可言、薄稻到稀存微、頂貨達二十元關左、羊杜尖脚地極硬、交易雖稀、市尙穩秀、通變高貨、去路略俏、中次仍不開展故價有一元上落高在十八元半次降一元、全日走銷祇客帮微動、故市乏升降、</p>
<p>滬南河下到貨不旺、本街走銷不一、　錫北粳巳有在二十元關外者、但大多數交易均祗十九元六七角之貨、市而較前日微堅、蘇同機粳、走銷平平、通崇帮因運輸關係略有視望故祇零拆勉動、高貨價十八元關左、南帮練塘·青角等薄早稻此間近亦枯薄、存到均淡貨客因此扳售行情帶緊以半角左右、羊尖等貨若隱若現、交易寥寥、市形仍無準的變陰元依然平庸客帮進胃清淡價無上落、高開十八元之譜、</p>
<h3>粉市漲勢緩和</h3>
<p>空户已補···勢難再拾</p>
<p>昨日粉市呈盤旋之象本月份自激漲以來、大部份之業外空頭、巳經逐步忍痛補進而軋空者之目標、因此亦稍稍放鬆、至就客銷而言天津報價、雖仍在三元七角八分左右、惟目下申粉巳不合算、故存底雖薄需求並不甚切也、至遠期各月份形勢、六月份因半屬陳粉、大廠家恐須繼續擯住、未來之市面、恐一時不能轉小、至七月份已爲完全新粉如麥收果豐、廠家亦不能再擯、蓋一年之計、似不能再作自殺之方略也、結果本月份較前日微好二厘半、六月份不動、七月份小五厘八月份小二厘半、九月份好五厘、十月份好二厘半云</p>
<h3>現麥做開四千包</h3>
<p>標準多頭出籠···略形軟化</p>
<p>昨日期麥上午開盤後、各月份市面、以洋麥報價又小二四角不等、天時雖仍未佳、雨則止故人心頗呈軟象、兼之浮多見獲利已豐、均有俟機脫售之意、故六七八九月份較前日頂盤小二分左右、迨至下午開盤、六月份以補空頗勁市稍回振、其餘月份、大致盤旋、觀此種景象似須新麥收成確有把握時方有較巨之上落也、結果六月份不動、七月份小一分八月份小二分、九月份大一分、十月份上午小一分、下午未開、現麥市面以陳麥巳將落令、客户似難久擯、故呈平穩之勢、開清江浦麥南宿州麥徐州麥蚌埠麥五兩一錢七分、紹興麥五兩一錢二分、共開四千包、由福新辦去多數云</p>
<h3>南北貨泉州大泡圓到缺市平</h3>

<p>厦桔餅、前因實銷不暢、存積巳久、地頭有鑒於斯、故早停製、邇者買客·因感來源稀少、進胃略濃、聞號盤日前皆經開出、價仍十五兩、市勢穩秀云、</p>
<h3>疋頭細布逐步向上</h3>
<p>邇來趨勢堅定實銷尙寂、細布大有欣欣向榮之勢、彩球陽鶴等牌、昨續高二分半、實以染色布去路復動、川帮成交陰丹士林及海昌藍細布有二百餘件、牛莊天津二帮復搜羅現貨故執貨者人心向上、細斜走銷亦暢、藍雙魚汕頭帮成交五十件、陽鶴廣帮復有採辦、惟粗布重磅布逐步下落、九磅布又小二分半、毛貓聚寳盆祗開四兩零七分半</p>
<h3>油市桕油存薄轉堅</h3>
<p>桕油銷塲燭淘本巳落令、而皂廠用度適當其時、本埠兩大皂廠、開年來巳辦千噸以上、市塲所謂洋莊交易者、並非出口、其實由洋行經辦而已、惟售價總不若出口生意之易於獲利、因洋行辦貨亦較前爲精明、故解貨時、油色之高低、鑒别極嚴、非如初辦時江西油可充作麻城油而解也、今年行家初時執有三四百噸、旋價格見漲、均須虧本、近日各皂廠需貨仍殷、而客貨如江西太湖等油、均巳無到、所賴于挹注者、惟漢上之麻城耳、聞連日漢函所詳、麻城油亦巳仍售至十三兩八錢、欲即加十四兩、大概係各産地存積不厚所致、而名重荆須十四兩二錢、三恒重荆亦十四兩、枝重十三两八錢、平荆十三兩五六錢、津市十三兩二三錢、較旬日前巳漲起二三錢矣、存底旣薄且漲、恐不易回鬆也、</p>

<p>一去不返前晚十時餘、劉贊臣收得印子錢後與愛妻沽酒歡聚適周熟明·周濟和·昆仲來訪、劉乃相與週旋、喜氣盈室狀殊愉快、嗣以香烟吸罄、劉即出門購買、而周等亦跟隨往外、詎知劉一去不返李陸氏久候不見劉歸、以精疲力倦、先行就寢、孰意一幕慘劇、於斯生矣　　慘屍一瞥昨晨九時餘、閘北四區總署太陽廟派出所巡長郭振岐、率警巡邏至金陵路華康路口之厠所内發現一槍殺男屍彈由頭部後右邊擊入前左太陽穴穿出身材魁梧、穿黑布褂褲、黄皮鞋黑襪、身畔有油布雨傘一頂、倒臥地上、血流滿地、厥狀甚慘、乃即回報總署、</p>

<h3>西哈諾的角色問題·雋</h3>
<p>復旦劇社排演西哈諾的消息、宣傳已久、一般愛好戲劇藝術的朋友們、不知渴望了多少日子、但是至今還見他們未有確實公演日期表示、於是外間種種猜測、不一而足、據我最近所知的關於西哈諾的消息、巳和從前稍爲有些變動、茲據實報告如後、以慰一般在期待着西哈諾的朋友們、</p>
<p>該劇中西哈諾一角、是全劇中最吃重的角色、本由該社的排演洪深君自己擔任的、戲也已經排過一幕了、後來洪君因自己對於全劇的責任極爲重大、再兼演主角、惟恐有顧此失彼的地方、怡巧這時該校舊同學馬彦祥君新由廣東返滬、洪君便决定把西哈諾一角讓給馬君擔任、馬君努力中國戲劇運動已久、且富於演劇經騐、對於這角色定能使我們滿意的、　　又該劇女主角霍克桑一角、在去年决定排演時、聞係由馬彦祥夫人陳沉櫻女士擔任的、後來陳女士離滬、遂攺請以演「寄生草」名聞一時的金衷愉女士、而金女士又以某種關係未能應命、於是最後决定由梁培曙女士任之、外間有傳云郁釗碧女士擔任者、空氣作用也、</p>

<p>在本刋上面時常讀到各校的生活新聞、惟我們晏摩氏女學獨付關如、說起來眞是慚愧啊、我現在不怕我底文字淺陋、大胆地寫點東西貢獻給諸位讀者、</p>
<p>今天我們底籃球隊、實力確很雄厚、後衛有中西轉來的運動家陳香衛女士、她是一位十八般武藝沒一件不精的健將、網球又是冠軍、在校裏的人那一個不認識她呢、還有一位便是凌憲場君令妹凌安娜女士、充籃球隊後衛、前幾天和崇德女學比賽勝了、也倚賴她們二位呢、</p>
<p>我們這裏也有吵客和大亨、她們椰揄敎員底手段比了男同學們還來得厲害、尤其是初出茅廬底敎員、有一次上數學課、那敎員聽說是素負盛名的S大學畢業生、他進課堂底時候、神氣得很、但等他一開口、幾乎把我們都笑了、因爲他說話底聲音低、眼睛不敢朝我們望、我們見他這樣、越是要望他、弄得他面孔漲紅、坐立不安、好容易才聽見鈴響、他便三步併二步跑出課堂、於是我們又嘻嘻哈哈了一陣、（琼）</p>
<h3>戀愛惹起筆戰</h3>
<p>C大學的社會科學院、是去年由W埠遷到閘北來的、牠的宿舍、恰爲N女校通學生必經的途徑、在這春光明媚春情易動的艶陽天氣、當然免不掉兩校學生由眉目間的傳情、漸到魚雁的往來、而達到所謂戀愛的結果、</p>
<p>起初、的確祇有C大學的密司脫L與N女校的密司L發生過摰熱的情愛、不過半年的光景吧、居然現在有一打半愛人之多、據我個人的調查、眞的、戀愛的傳染性恰如上海時髦的傳染性一樣的發展、祗恨阿拉沒有到那邊宿舍去住得、不然、或者也有對象吧、</p>
<p>在N女校的校長的眼中、當然、這是有損校風、爲着杜防兩校學生戀愛狂的傳染起見、特地致函N大校、略云「···敝校校風、素聞滬上、自貴校遷來以後、即發生許多戀愛之事、似由貴校訓育不嚴所致、應請貴校即日遷移以雙方···」等語、</p>
<p>C大學的當局、特將此事、提到校務會議討論、决議這樣的回答、「···敝校學生、向在W埠嚴肅是守、自與貴校毘連以後、始行發生此等不幸之事、顯係貴校應負其咎、特請貴校從速遷移、免損雙方學生學業···」</p>
<p>此信去後、N女校聞又回一詞句更形嚴厲之函、C大學準以合法手續對付、若不早日解决、恐將風潮擴大、至於究應誰遷、固然這是上海法院的事、但法律沒有明文、又無舊例可援、我倒替法官有點爲難、還是希望不到法庭上去解决吧、（馬芳齋）</p>
<h3>大學電影熱·微·茵</h3>
<p>電影、這新興的第八藝術、這銀色的享樂、這日日的夢幻、在我們的大學裏、是受了同學們極熱烈的歡迎的、</p>
<p>剛一看過璇宮艶史後、珍妮麥唐爾做了男同學信仰的中心、裏面的March成爲同學們中最通行的歌曲「早安、我后陛下」、這句富有誘惑性的句子成爲同學中互相道安問好的調頭、</p>
<p>明眼的同學、捉住了大學生的這個缺點、特地到上海去租了片子來、在校裏的體育館開映、賣價只有兩毛小洋、自然是會吸收到很多的觀衆了、</p>
<p>這次開映的片子曾在都市裏轟動一時的｜</p>
<p>『紅髮女郎』</p>
<p>這個熱的女郎降臨到大學中來了、她那美而健的體格、她那個嬌憨的姿態、她那個活潑的表情、她那個討氣的樣子、呌一班「女人歌與血」的大學生羣集在平常爲一班健兒們所佔據的健身房中來、　　一對對的情侶、在晚飯後携手來到了門口、目光注視着廣告板上誘人廣告圖畫、自然而然地便雙雙走進了體育館中、並肓坐在人叢之内、喁喁地談着衷心的情話、走過身旁的同學狠命地釘着他倆、眼光中充滿了妒嫉的毒燄、</p>
<p>敎哲學的袁博士偕着他的年青的妹妹也來了、他仍然是擺着哲學家的面龐、神聖不可侵犯地扳起了臉、身旁像花蝴蝶一樣地女同學、都呆看着他在暗笑、</p>
<p>燈終於暗了、電影一幕幕地在進行、裏面的情節由鬆懈而緊張、同學們的心靈也跟着不斷地變化、</p>
<p>遇到銀幕上有接吻的表情時、池子裏的男同學便怪聲呌好而女同學則羞紅了臉、而嘘嘘的聲音乃夾着嘴吻翕張的聲浪轉了開來、</p>
<p>燈又亮了、銀幕上映出了再見的字樣、大學生才由極度的疲倦中拖着懶惰身子回進宿舍、晚上還做了一個極甜的蜜的香夢、</p>
<p>大學電影熱、這眞是青春的跳躍呢、</p>
<h3>學生軍兵變·西</h3>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Movement of Self-Purification</h3>
<p>Gandhi, in a letter to the United States, stated that this movement is not a movement of resistance but a movement of self-purification. For example, in banning alcohol, one must first abstain from drinking and then begin by inspecting hotels. In boycotting foreign cloth, one must first not use foreign cloth and then begin by promoting domestic cloth. This movement of self-purification originates from the conscience of each individual and is based on the freedom of each individual. It cannot be interfered with or obstructed by any external force. This is truly the most powerful force in the world and is possessed by people of every country. However, people of every country, although possessing this power, often give it up. Even if someone is moved by a moment of anger and suddenly realizes that this strategy of self-purification must be used, the hearts of the people cannot be united, the spirit cannot be cohesive, and the energy cannot be sustained. Thus, before the effect of purification is seen, they are unable to maintain it. Before external forces exert pressure, they themselves retreat in fear. This is why the movement of self-purification ultimately fails. Today, the Indian people's engagement in this movement can be said to be long-lasting and unfailing. They first applied it to salt and then to other categories. Whatever is within the scope of our own ability, we all use this great spirit to carry out this work of purifying ourselves. Although we have repeatedly experienced great suppression and obstruction, since the movement does not go beyond the scope of our own affairs, people will be unable to do anything. Therefore, the meaning of the movement of self-purification is even clearer and more righteous than the meaning of non-violent resistance.</p>
<p>In the world, no matter what the matter, the step of purifying oneself is the most difficult. Even extremely small things are not easy, let alone the so-called purification of the independence movement, which includes so much. The responsibility of the Indian people is also very heavy.</p>

Jiang still ordered him to be untied and sent Shao Lizi to comfort Wan. When Wan saw Shao, he knelt down and begged for leniency. He is still being held in a train at the headquarters, and his daily life is being taken care of well. Wan is 29 years old and from Luoyang. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>Central Executive Committee Sends Telegram</p>
<h3>Commending Commander-in-Chief Jiang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Executive Committee decided at its 93rd Standing Committee meeting this morning to send a special telegram of commendation to Commander-in-Chief Jiang and the anti-rebel generals and soldiers. The original telegram stated, "To Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Jiang Zhongzheng and to all the generals and soldiers of the anti-rebel armies and divisions on the front lines: Yan and Feng, clinging to feudal habits and deceived by scheming scoundrels, betrayed the country and harmed the people, willingly becoming ringleaders of the rebellion. Our party, upholding the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and following the expectations of the people, during the period of political tutelage and reconstruction, suddenly faced this act of undermining unity and peace. We offered advice and warnings, but they were unable to restrain their ferocity and stubbornness. Therefore, we authorized our comrades to take on the responsibility of suppressing the rebellion, directing generals and soldiers to work hard to eliminate them, to stop the chaos and eliminate the evil, so that the disturbers will stop the disturbance and the evildoers will be forbidden from evil. Since the start, thanks to the proper command of our comrades and the energetic efforts of the generals and soldiers, the army has been invincible wherever it goes, proving that an army with a just cause is invincible, and the rebels will eventually not be able to survive. Now that the rebellious army's wild assault is collapsing, sweeping away the gloom is expected to be soon. Comrades and all the generals and soldiers, your contributions to stabilizing the party and the country and eliminating the fierce and brutal are deeply commendable. We especially hope that you will take advantage of the momentum to pursue the fleeing enemy, advance and eliminate them, sweep away the smoke of war in Yan and Ji, wash away the traces of rebellion in He and Fen, deliver the people from fire and water, and strengthen the foundation of the country. It is hoped that the foundation of the revolution will be strengthened and peaceful construction can be expected. We send this special telegram of commendation, awaiting complete success. Printed by the Central Executive Committee. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>British House of Commons</h3>
<p>Escalating Unemployment Issue</p>
<p>Mosley Announces Reasons for Resignation</p>
<p>Parliament May Face Dissolution</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st - Resigned cabinet member Mosley announced his reasons for resignation in the House of Commons today and read aloud a letter to the Prime Minister, stating that the cabinet committee chaired by Snowden completely rejected his memorandum submitted on January 1st requesting changes to the government's unemployment policy. Subsequent discussions only served to further highlight the differences in opinion. He felt it was a matter of honor and had to resign. He remains a loyal member of the Labour Party in his votes and actions, but he is free to request the Labour Party to adopt a policy that is more in line with the promises made during the election than the current method. Labour Party members of Parliament gathered today to study the reasons for Mosley's resignation, but Minister for Unemployment Thomas did not attend, so the meeting adjourned after a brief discussion. Tomorrow's Labour Party MP meeting may have extremely important results. Mosley has issued a notice stating that he will propose a motion of no confidence in the government's unemployment policy. It is expected that Prime Minister MacDonald will demand a vote of confidence. If a vote of confidence is not passed, and Mosley does not withdraw his proposal, he will immediately request the King to dissolve Parliament.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd - Conservative MPs have decided to demand a re-debate on the unemployment issue in the House of Commons on the 28th of this month. At that time, the Conservative Party will again propose reducing the salary of Minister for Unemployment Thomas. The Conservative Party had already made this proposal on Monday, but the government defeated it by a majority of fifteen votes. It is feared that more Labour and Liberal MPs will abstain from voting than on Monday, and the government may inevitably fail.</p>

Therefore, Chief Delegate Stimson, who attended the meeting that day, had temporarily agreed to exchange declarations with Britain and Japan. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Borah also stated today that the committee's review of the treaty is in progress and is preparing to complete the case during this session.</p>
<h3>British Industrial Rationalization Plan</h3>

These two major corporations are the result of a merger of five well-known companies.</p>
<h3>Polish Government Opens New Port</h3>
<p>Danzig Files Protest with the League of Nations</p>
<p>National News Agency, Danzig, 21st - The Free City of Danzig has strongly protested to the League of Nations against the increasingly blatant attitude of the Polish government in excluding the Port of Danzig after opening the Qinji port in the national territory. It claims that Danzig was separated from Germany at the Versailles Conference solely because Poland wanted a good outlet to the sea, and presents various evidence of the increasingly serious situation in the city's economic circles to support this claim.</p>
<p>Note: Danzig is located on the Baltic Sea, at the throat of Poland's maritime transportation. It was not operated by the Germans for many years, and a military port was built to prevent the westward invasion of the Russians. After the European War, it was changed to a free city, protected by the League of Nations, while Poland still holds ordinary economic privileges.</p>

<h3>Opinions on Revising the League of Nations Charter</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st - Foreign Minister Henderson stated in the House of Commons today that he is currently paying serious attention to various incidents regarding communist propaganda, and also stated that the Charter of the League of Nations should be revised to be in line with Paris. The British government believes that the League Committee's proposal on this matter can be satisfactory, but still reserves the right to propose revisions to the details. It is still difficult to determine whether the government's obligations will be expanded due to the revision. In reality, there may be a slight expansion, but overall, the revision of the Charter will make war less likely to occur.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Inspection Trip to Guide City</h3>
<p>Central Army Takes Guide City</p>
<p>The Traffic Between Xuzhou and Guide Has Been Quickly Restored</p>
<p>Xuzhou dispatch: After the Central Army captured Guide City, Chiang Kai-shek took a special train west at 3 PM on the 18th, accompanied by all the personnel of the headquarters train. He arrived at Guide Station at 12 AM that night, where Liu Zhi, Yang Jie, Jiang Chuoou, and others welcomed him and reported on the situation. Chiang Kai-shek stayed on the train overnight, and at 9 AM the next morning, he, along with Liu Zhi and the staff and guards of the headquarters, traveled by car to inspect Guide City. He returned to the train at 12 PM and headed east, arriving in Xuzhou at 5 PM that evening.</p>
<p>During the attack on Guide City, the 35th Division of the defending Wan Army, overwhelmed by the intense artillery fire of the Central Army on the 16th and 17th, Division Commander Wan Dianzun led two regiments of his command out of the west gate at midnight on the 17th, intending to go to Xiaoba Town to join his nephew Wan Xuancai's troops in Lanfeng. The Central 11th Division and the 1st Training Division immediately pursued and also notified the 1st and 3rd Divisions to intercept them. Wan Dianzun, seeing that more than half of his troops were killed or wounded, disguised himself as a civilian, but was eventually captured by cavalry. Initially, they did not know he was the division commander, but people noticed that he was fair-skinned and unusual. Upon questioning the prisoners, he admitted his identity. Many brigade and regimental commanders were also captured. The defending soldiers raised a white flag on the morning of the 18th, but negotiations were unsuccessful. The besieging troops launched another major offensive. The assault team of the Training Division, under the cover of the artillery, advanced bravely. Street fighting continued until 2 PM, when the entire city was finally cleared. In addition to Wan's entire division and a regiment drawn from Wan Xuancai's troops, more than 400 students from Sun Dianying's military academy and other attached units were captured, totaling no less than 5,000 people. Over 4,000 rifles, 12 machine guns, and 8 mountain guns and mortars each were seized. After being captured, Wan Dianzun was held in the headquarters of the 2nd Army Corps. Liu Zhi has now dispatched Jiang Shan, the adjutant of the 1st Training Division, to escort Wan from Guide through Xuzhou to Beijing.</p>
<p>The battle of Xiaoba was the fiercest battle on the Longhai Railway line. Wan Xuancai's troops, with the 38th and 65th Divisions and the Independent 9th Brigade as the main force, and with the addition of approximately three divisions of Sun Chu's former troops advancing eastward from Liuhe to reinforce, were engaged by the Central forces with the 1st Division as the main force, along with a portion of the 11th and 3rd Divisions, advancing fiercely along both sides of the railway. The area was open plain with no defensive features, so the Wan Army collapsed as soon as contact was made. According to the telegraphic report from the Commander of the 1st Division, Xu Tingyao, a total of 17,000 to 18,000 people were captured in this battle, including enemy brigade commanders Li Wanru and Song Zhaokui, and dozens of regimental and battalion commanders. Countless weapons, ammunition, and supplies were seized and are now being used to press toward Libaji. All captured personnel have now been sent to Guide Station to be held by the headquarters of the 2nd Army Corps. Aside from those who were discharged and sent back to their hometowns, more than 10,000 captured soldiers volunteered to join the army. 6,000 of these were organized into a transportation corps, and the rest were handed over to the Prisoner of War Management Office for disposition.</p>
<p>Erlang Mountain, north of Liouquan and south of Liguo Station, north of Xuzhou, is a vital point on the northern border of Xuzhou. There are barracks built there by Chen Yi in the past. Chiang Kai-shek went to inspect it today (the 20th). He set off at 10 AM, inspected Erlang Mountain, and then returned to Xuzhou.</p>
<p>Westward transportation has long been restored. Currently, the direct telegraph line between Xuzhou and Guide has also been repaired and is open. However, the route west of Guide has not yet been repaired. Qian Zongze went to Guide on the 19th to supervise the repairs, and ordered Wang Gengyu, the director of the transportation branch office stationed in Dangshan, to move to Guide Station to facilitate military transportation. After returning to Xuzhou from the front, Yu Feipeng, the Quartermaster General, also transported a large number of supplies to Guide on the 19th to establish a branch station. Li Longjun, a special commissioner from the Ministry of Communications, appointed Chen Fangchun to manage the Guide Telegraph Bureau due to a lack of personnel, and transferred the Dangshan express machine to Guide for operation. He also dispatched Dou Ruihua west to repair the telegraph lines west of Guide, in order to fully restore transportation as soon as possible. (20th)</p>
<h3>He Chengjun Goes to Luohe Again</h3>
<p>Headquarters of the 3rd Army Corps Will Move to Luohe Within Days</p>
<p>Hankou dispatch: He Chengjun, the commander-in-chief of the 3rd Army Corps, moved the headquarters of the 3rd Army Corps to Zhumadian. He once went to Luohe for inspection. Now, with the general attack order issued and the fighting raging on the front lines, he urgently needs to go to the front to command in order to facilitate military operations. Therefore, on the morning of the 20th, he went from Zhumadian to Luohe, arriving on the same day. He immediately summoned the generals in Luohe to inquire about the combat situation in recent days and held a military conference to decide on the offensive strategy. After the meeting, the generals led their troops forward step by step. It is reported that the divisions of Shangguan, Hao, Zhao, etc., which were encircling the remnants of the enemy in LinYing, have been attacking successfully in recent days. The officers of the Fan's troops have repeatedly sent personnel to negotiate surrender and should be completely resolved within days. The troops that have crossed LinYing are attacking Xuchang along Pingning City, Aicheng River, and Wunudian. As for the left wing, there are still remnants of Zhang Weixi's troops in Lushan and Yexian. Xu Yuanquan has ordered Xu Jiwu and Liu Peixu's two brigades of the 48th Division to be responsible for suppressing them. Xu will advance directly north with Xiao Zhichu's division. This time, the battle on the Ping-Han Railway started later but was quite fierce. Xu Yuanquan, Wang Jinyu, and other senior generals are personally commanding on the front lines. He Chengjun also plans to return to Zhumadian temporarily on the 21st and move the headquarters of the 3rd Army Corps to Luohe within the 22nd and 23rd to supervise the advance of the various armies and launch a major attack on Zhengzhou. It is expected that the date of the major battle is not far away. (May 21st)</p>

<h3>Quiet News from Caozhou Battlefront</h3>
<p>Jinan dispatch: Today, news from the Caozhou area is unusually quiet. It is said that Han Fuju and Ma Hongkui are still commanding military operations in Yuncheng. Ma's troops have been completely concentrated in Yuncheng from Tai'an, pushing forward on the northwest and west sides of Yuncheng, first clearing the south bank of the Yellow River, and then crossing the river northward. Chen Tiaoyuan is still in Juye. Fan Xiji's 46th Division and Ruan Zhaochang's 55th Division are currently near Heze and Dingtao, intercepting Shi Yousan's troops. Shi himself seems to be in the Heze area. Jiang Bocheng, the chief advisor of the headquarters, originally planned to go to Yuncheng to meet with Han Fuju, but Han telegraphed that he would return to Jinan within days, so Jiang stopped his trip. There is no fighting in the Yucheng area in northern Shandong. However, since the outbreak of the military conflict, all boats on the Yellow River have been ordered to dock to prevent the enemy from crossing, which has created problems for the livelihood of boatmen. Today, the provincial government's standing committee decided that boatmen stranded in various places will be given a living allowance of one jiao per person per day by the local county government.</p>
<p>The boatmen in Luokou will be paid by the Jinan Municipal Government after receiving funds from the Department of Finance. (May 20th)</p>
<h3>High Court Judgment on the Gao Ying Case</h3>
<p>After the Jiangsu High Court rendered a judgment on the Gao Ying appeal case on the 17th of this month, the full text of the judgment was delivered today (the 22nd). It is transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>"Criminal Judgment of the Jiangsu High Court, (19th Year Su Zi No. 376) Appellant: Jiangning District Court Prosecutor; Appellant: Gao Ying, male, 35 years old, from Changle County, Fujian Province, residing at Hefeng Lane, Jiaozhou Road, Shanghai; Former Vice Consul of the Consulate General of San Francisco, Gao Liao Shi, female, 24 years old, from Huiyang County, Guangdong Province, residing at the same address; Appointed Defense Attorneys: Wang Youling, Attorney-at-Law, Liu Shifang, Attorney-at-Law; Defendant: Sun Yuan, male, 40 years old, from Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, residing in San Francisco, USA, former Chief Clerk of the Consulate General of San Francisco; Appointed Defense Attorneys: Li Zongqian, Attorney-at-Law, Hu Zhen, Attorney-at-Law. The above-listed appellants, Gao Ying et al., filed an appeal against the first-instance judgment of the Jiangning District Court on November 11, 18th year of the Republic of China, in the case of Gao Ying et al. concerning opium and dereliction of duty. After hearing the appeal, this court renders the following judgment: The original judgment is reversed. Gao Ying is sentenced to five years of imprisonment and a fine of 5,000 yuan for the crime of attempted assistance in opium trafficking, and three years of imprisonment and a fine of 3,000 yuan for the crime of soliciting bribes in connection with his official duties. The sentences of imprisonment shall be executed for a total of six years, and the total fine shall be 6,000 yuan. Gao Liao Shi is sentenced to four years of imprisonment and a fine of 4,000 yuan for the crime of attempted assistance in opium trafficking. Sun Yuan is sentenced to five years of imprisonment and a fine of 5,000 yuan for the crime of attempted assistance in opium trafficking. The number of days of detention before the judgment becomes final shall be deducted from the term of imprisonment at a rate of two days for each day of imprisonment. If the fine is not paid in full, each three yuan shall be converted into one day of imprisonment, but the term of imprisonment shall not exceed one year. The two cans of opium are confiscated and destroyed by burning.</p>
<p>The facts are that Gao Ying (also known as Gao Qianzhai) served as the Vice Consul at the Chinese Consulate General in San Francisco, USA. Sun Yuan, the Chief Clerk of the consulate, was aware of the international practice that the luggage of consulate personnel and their families could be exempted from inspection upon entry. Taking advantage of this opportunity, he colluded with unscrupulous overseas Chinese Shou Nan Ruoyun and unscrupulous merchants Shen Guang Wen Yuxian in Hong Kong, and in the 18th year of the Republic of China, had Gao Ying's wife, Gao Liao Shi (also known as Gao Liao Chengsu), return to China and travel to Hong Kong to transport 2,299 cans of opium divided into eleven boxes, each bearing the seals of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government and the signature of the Consulate General of the Republic of China in San Francisco, as her own luggage. Sun Yuan then transferred the opium to the consignees Shou Nan (also known as Fushou, Ruoyun, etc.) in exchange for a large reward. However, when Gao Liao Shi arrived in San Francisco on the Tianyang Maru on July 5th of that year, the U.S. Customs had already detected the previous situation and detained the luggage Gao Liao Shi had brought. On July 8th of the same month, the boxes were opened and inspected, and the aforementioned opium and letters from Shen Guang Wen Yuxian to Sun Yuan Ruoyun Shou Nan were found. The U.S. court arrested Gao Ying and his wife and Sun Yuan and released them on bail pending trial. After repeated negotiations by Minister Wu in the United States, Gao Ying and the other two people, along with two cans of opium, photographs of the letters, and certificates from U.S. Customs officials, were sent back to China and handed over to the Jiangning District Court Prosecutor for investigation. It was also discovered that in April of the 17th year of the Republic of China, Gao Ying, at the request of Chen Yi, admitted to receiving four Chinese laborers, Mei Guang, Mei Geng, Wu Zhuo, and Lu Huan, who were going to the United States. They agreed to a reward of US$2,400 to US$3,000. On June 8th of the same year, Mei Guang et al. arrived at the port on the Siberia. Gao Ying boarded the ship to receive them and discovered that the passports had been forged and the name of the Mexican Consulate had been abused. Knowing that it was not feasible, he sent Mei Guang et al. back. The former Minister Shi in the United States reported the matter to the National Government for the record. The case was investigated together and transferred to the criminal court for trial and judgment. In addition to sentencing Gao Ying and Gao Liao Shi to respective criminal punishments, Sun Yuan was found not guilty. Gao Ying and Gao Liao Shi disagreed and filed an appeal. The original prosecutor also disagreed with the part of the judgment that found Sun Yuan not guilty and appealed.</p>
<p>The reasons are that the facts of the crime in this case can be roughly divided into two parts: one is the opium part, and the other is the dereliction of duty part. These will be explained separately below. (A) Regarding the opium part, it was found that during Gao Liao Shi's trip from China to the United States, U.S. Customs inspected the luggage and found 2,299 cans of opium paste in the eleven boxes she was carrying. These facts are not only proven by certificates issued by U.S. Customs inspectors Harris and Smith, but also not denied by Gao Liao Shi, Gao Ying, Sun Yuan, and others. What should be investigated now is who owns the opium, whether it was transported to the United States for sale, and if it was transported on behalf of someone, whether Gao Liao Shi was aware of it and whether Gao Ying and Sun Yuan were involved. All of these are issues that should be resolved in this case and will be explained separately below. First, who owns the opium? It was found that there were a total of four letters found by U.S. Customs in Gao Liao Shi's own boxes. One was a letter jointly signed by Wen Yuxian and Shen Guang to Shou Nan, which stated, "Now the bearer is bringing two foreign boxes," and "These goods are all from Brother Shen Guang." The second was a letter solely signed by Shen Guang to Ruoyun, which stated, "Now Mr. Gao is bringing nine foreign boxes." The third was a letter jointly signed by Wen Yuxian and Shen Guang to Sun Yuan, which stated, "Please, brother, distribute the foreign boxes according to the letter to Brother Ruoyun and Shou Nan for receipt." The fourth was a letter solely signed by Wen Yuxian to Sun Yuan, with a similar meaning. It is certain that the opium was sent to the American overseas Chinese Shou Nan and Ruoyun by the unscrupulous Chinese merchants Wen Yuxian and Shen Guang. It was entrusted to Gao Liao Shi to carry it on their behalf and was not owned by Gao Liao Shi herself, which can be determined. Gao Liao Shi's claim that it was entrusted to her by Mr. and Mrs. Chen is not credible. Second, was it transported to the United States for sale? The letter from Wen Yuxian and Shen Guang to Shou Nan stated, "Now the bearer is bringing two foreign boxes, containing a certain number of K-branded Korean ginseng, with a cost of 85 yuan per branch and a carrying fee of 10 yuan per branch; a certain number of Chang-branded Korean ginseng, with a cost of 70 yuan per branch and a carrying fee of 5 yuan per branch." The fact that the seized opium cans had both K and Chang brands shows that the so-called Korean ginseng was clearly a euphemism for opium. Since the cost and carrying fee were indicated, it is clear evidence of sale. The letter also stated, "Please telegraph peace and the price as soon as the goods are received," and "If you remit silver, please send it to Guangdong Bank for Brother Shen Guang to receive it." The opium was transported to the United States for sale, which is undeniable. Third, was Gao Liao Shi aware that she was carrying the opium? Although Gao Liao Shi has consistently argued that the boxes containing opium were entrusted to her by Mr. and Mrs. Chen, and that she did not know that they contained opium, the boxes were originally sent by Wen Yuxian and Shen Guang to Ruoyun, as mentioned above. Gao Liao Shi claimed that they were entrusted to her by Mr. and Mrs. Chen, and could not provide the exact address of Mr. and Mrs. Chen. Her attempts to deceive are obvious. According to the letter from Shen Guang to Ruoyun, "Now Mr. Gao is bringing nine foreign boxes." The letter from Yuxian and Shen Guang to Shou Nan stated, "Now the bearer is bringing two foreign boxes." The so-called "Mr. Gao" and the so-called "bearer" both refer to Gao Liao Shi. The letter also stated, "The cost per branch is a certain amount of yuan, and the carrying fee per branch is a certain amount of yuan," and "Please pay the carrying fee according to the letter and do not overpay." The so-called carrying fee refers to the reward for carrying and transporting. The letter ended with "This carrying fee was agreed upon face-to-face between my brother and him." The "him" here clearly refers to the person carrying the opium, that is, Gao Liao Shi. Since she had personally contacted Wen Yuxian, Shen Guang, and others who were selling opium, and agreed on a reward before carrying and transporting it, how could she not know that it contained opium? She was greedy for the reward and provided direct and important assistance to Wen Yuxian and others in selling opium, which is beyond doubt. The boxes were affixed with the seals of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government and the signatures of the Consulate General of the Republic of China in San Francisco (as seen in the photographs of the boxes obtained from U.S. Customs), and Gao Liao Shi filled out the baggage declaration according to regulations as her own baggage (as admitted by Gao Liao Shi) in order to avoid inspection. The key to the box and the letters from Wen Yuxian, Shen Guang, and others were stored in her own box (as seen in the certificate from U.S. Customs officials). Gao Liao Shi's assisting behavior can be described as meticulous. To claim that she was unaware of the situation is a deception. Fourth, was Gao Ying involved in this opium case? The responsibility under criminal law can only be borne by the actor and cannot be imposed on someone other than the actor. Therefore, if Gao Ying was unaware that Gao Liao Shi was carrying opium for others, he cannot be held jointly liable solely because of the relationship between husband and wife. However, after reviewing the circumstances of this case, there are differences. Gao Ying was the Vice Consul, and his wife, Gao Liao Shi, was not an ignorant woman. If Gao Ying had not known about and condoned it in advance, she would not have done such an illegal and humiliating thing as the wife of a consul. Furthermore, the boxes carried by Gao Liao Shi were affixed with the Consulate's signature and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' seal. Since these seals and signatures were important conditions for carrying opium, if Gao Ying had not colluded in advance and issued them in advance, where would Gao Liao Shi have obtained them? Moreover, as soon as Gao Liao Shi's luggage was detained by U.S. Customs, Gao Ying immediately telegraphed Minister Wu, requesting negotiations for exemption from inspection and release. The telegram stated, "The box contains a small amount of drugs, which my wife was asked to bring by someone. For the sake of preserving the national integrity, it is absolutely forbidden to open it for inspection," (Telegram of July 5th). Before opening the box for inspection, Gao Ying sent another telegram to Minister Wu, urging him to negotiate. One said, "If it is opened for inspection, the national integrity will be completely lost. Please negotiate to have it destroyed." (Another telegram was sent in the name of Gao Liao Shi on July 7th, and two more telegrams were sent on July 8th). His panicked state had already been revealed in his words. After the opium was discovered after the inspection, Minister Wu ordered Consul General Gong Anqing to investigate. According to his reply, "Vice Consul Gao and his wife firmly refused to reveal the names of the people who contacted them in China and San Francisco, saying that they were afraid of unexpected retaliation." This is sufficient to show that there were people who contacted Gao Ying in China and San Francisco. According to the aforementioned seized letters, the people who contacted him in China were Shen Guang and Wen Yuxian, and the people who contacted him in San Francisco were Shou Nan and Ruoyun. The reason why Gao Ying and his wife were unwilling to announce their names at the time was that U.S. Customs had not yet announced the letters found in Gao Liao Shi's boxes, and they were afraid of unexpected retaliation if they announced them in advance. From the above-mentioned circumstances, comprehensively observed, it is very clear that Gao Ying used the opportunity of being a consul, colluded with his wife, and provided direct and important assistance to merchants selling opium. Fifth, was Sun Yuan involved in this opium case? Although Sun Yuan claimed that he knew nothing about Gao Liao Shi's carrying of opium, and that he did not know Wen Yuxian, Shen Guang, Shou Nan, Ruoyun, and others, the letters found in Gao Liao Shi's luggage to be handed over to Sun Yuan included one jointly signed by Yuxian and Shen Guang, which stated, "Now the bearer is bringing foreign boxes No. 1 to No. 9, a total of nine boxes, to Brother Ruoyun for receipt, and two foreign boxes to Brother Shou Nan for receipt. When they arrive at the port, please distribute the foreign boxes according to the letter to Brother Ruoyun and Brother Shou Nan. After handing over the foreign boxes, please telegraph peace." The other was solely signed by Wen Yuxian, which stated, "Please open the foreign boxes in person and check that boxes No. 2 and No. 11 are handed over to Brother Shou Nan for receipt, and the rest should be handed over to Brother Fu." Although the opium was carried to the United States by Gao Liao Shi, it still had to be transferred by Sun Yuan. According to the wording of the letters, it was not polite at all, not only entrusting him to transfer it, but also requesting a telegram reply, which is sufficient to show that both parties granting and receiving had extremely close relations with Sun Yuan, and even more sufficient to show that they had contacted him beforehand. Otherwise, why would Wen Yuxian, Shen Guang, and others rashly entrust a stranger with opium worth millions to transfer? Moreover, since the address of the consignee was not specified in the letter, if Sun Yuan did not know Ruoyun and Shou Nan, how could the opium be transferred separately? Moreover, since the opium had been carried to the United States by Gao Liao Shi, if it had nothing to do with Sun Yuan, it could have been delivered directly by Gao Liao Shi or Gao Ying, which would have achieved its purpose. Why would it necessarily need to be transferred by Sun Yuan? From the situation of this transfer that must be delivered by transshipment, it can be proven that Sun Yuan was one of the intermediaries in the contact. Although the original letter did not contain any words of prior contact, judging from the tone of the entire article, it is extremely clear that there was prior contact. Or it can be said that since the opium was detained as soon as it arrived in the United States, Sun Yuan's transfer behavior could not be realized, that is, his behavior of assisting in the sale had not yet begun. However, there is considerable evidence of Sun Yuan's prior contact and introduction. This behavior cannot be said to be non-assisting behavior merely because the opium was seized and could not be transferred afterwards. Based on the above explanation, Gao Ying, Gao Liao Shi, and Sun Yuan all had prior contact with Wen Yuxian and others in the sale of opium, and they all used international practices to provide direct and important assistance to unscrupulous merchants selling opium as consular personnel. Some carried it to the country for them, and others made plans in the United States to respond. They divided the work and cooperated, and their uses were equal. Those who acted and those who stayed were equally guilty. However, because it was discovered midway, and Wen Yuxian and others did not achieve the purpose of selling, Gao Ying, Gao Liao Shi, Sun Yuan, and others only committed the crime of attempted assistance in opium trafficking.

<h3>Jiangxi Bandit Suppression Headquarters Moves to Nanxun Road</h3>
<p>From Zhangshu to Tujiapu</p>
<p>Nanchang dispatch: Since Jiangxi Province was divided into two major bandit suppression defense zones, two brigades of the 18th Division, one brigade of Cheng Guangyao, and Chen Lei's regiment have moved to northern and western Jiangxi. The 12th Division and the newly formed 13th Division have moved to southern and eastern Jiangxi, and are carrying out suppression according to plan. However, the General Headquarters for Bandit Suppression of the entire province was originally stationed in Zhangshu Town. This place can take care of southern and western Jiangxi, but it is beyond its reach for northern Jiangxi. Now, Zhang Huizan believes that Nanxun Road in northern Jiangxi is the throat of transportation in the province. Recently, it has been repeatedly cut off and destroyed by bandits, and Xiushui and Ruichang have also been captured by bandits. He urgently needs to supervise the suppression in person to consolidate the province's gateway. Therefore, yesterday he led the entire staff of the headquarters from Zhangshu to the province, and today took the Nanxun Road train to Tujiapu, which is located in the middle of the Nanxun Road (within Yongxiu). The command is also very convenient. Currently, the 103rd Regiment and the Engineer Battalion have been stationed along the Nanxun Road. Zhu Yaohua's brigade is also stationed in the Tongwan area, and Xiushui has been recaptured. Chen Lei's regiment is stationed in the Wurui area, suppressing the bandits in Ruichang. After the Bandit Suppression Headquarters is deployed in Tupu, Zhang Huizan plans to go to various places in northern Jiangxi to inspect the defenses. As for the defense of Zhangshu, it is temporarily the responsibility of Deng Ying of the New 13th Division. (20th)</p>

<p>Harbin Correspondence: After the ice melted on the Songhua, Heilong, and Ussuri Rivers this year, in addition to the regular boat service from Fujin to Harbin on the Songhua River, the Sino-Russian disputes over the Eastern Railway last year led both countries to lay mines at the Three Rivers Estuary. Before the mines were cleared, merchant ships were naturally hesitant. Therefore, since navigation began in late April, no ships had ventured on the Black River and Ussuri River. Recently, the River Defense Fleet Command dispatched Fan Xishen, the former captain of the Jiang'an warship, with over twenty naval personnel, on a Northeast Shipping Bureau ship to inspect the waterways at the Three Rivers Estuary and observe Russian activities. Aside from two Russian warships stationed near Xu'erwei, there was no significant activity. Realizing that navigation on the Black River and Ussuri River might proceed without incident, he supervised the naval personnel in removing the mines inside and outside the Three Rivers Estuary. He also telegraphed the Northeast Shipping Bureau in Harbin, which relayed the information to the various shipping companies. Upon receiving the news, the companies prepared to operate ship services on the Black River and Ussuri River. The Black River route will temporarily terminate at Heihe, and the Ussuri River route will terminate at Hulin. It was decided that the Northeast Shipping Bureau's Suzhou ship would conduct a test voyage on the 16th of this month. After the Suzhou ship sets sail, several other merchant ships will follow, maintaining a distance of two days' voyage. If the Suzhou ship encounters misfortune, the subsequent ships will be able to stop sailing. The Naval River Defense Command has also ordered the river defense ships Lishui, Jiangqing, and Liji to anchor between Fujin and Tongjiang to provide assistance in case of emergency. According to the shipping industry, the only concern for merchant ships venturing out of the Three Rivers Estuary is the risk of uncleared mines. The Sino-Russian negotiations on navigation rights only involve the long-pending issue of Chinese ships navigating out to sea via Nikolayevsk-on-Amur (a treaty port), with no other problems. The Black and Ussuri Rivers are jointly owned by China and Russia. According to international law and the new and old Sino-Russian treaties, both countries have freedom of navigation and neither should hinder or interfere. The publicly applicable navigation regulations were also established as early as 1928 by Zhang Shouzeng, the supervisor of the Hunchun Customs, and Mo Yumeide, the Russian consul in Heihe, along with relevant personnel from both sides, with the permission of both governments. They jointly organized the Sino-Russian Waterway Committee and stipulated ninety-six articles, which have long been implemented. Although Russia took various irregular actions last year during the Sino-Russian dispute, these were after the severance of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Now that diplomatic relations are gradually being restored, and an agreement has been reached to restore the peaceful state of the Sino-Soviet border as a prerequisite, the eastern and western routes have long been as peaceful as usual. Jointly owned rivers are still open to navigation, and there is no further question about it. However, the Sino-Soviet conference is currently being held in Moscow, and it is anticipated that the voyage of our merchant ships on the Black River and Ussuri River will not be dangerous.

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Detailed Account of the Robbery at Shengzi Temple Town in Punan, Under the Jurisdiction of the County: Shengzi Temple Town in Punan, under the jurisdiction of the county, is located at the intersection of Songjiang and Fengxian, about six li away from Tinglin and Yexie. The commercial market is not prosperous, with only small-scale shops. There is a police station with six police officers, led by one patrol chief, under the jurisdiction of the First Branch Bureau of Tinglin. On that day (the 20th) afternoon, a gasoline boat towed two Wujiang boats was docked outside the town at San Cha Yang. The people on the boats looked like villagers. When the Songshan steamboat passed by, people on the Wujiang boats peeked and looked around, which was very suspicious. The townspeople warned each other. Unexpectedly, a robbery and police-killing incident occurred that night. It has been learned that there were about thirty to forty robbers who entered the town, each holding flashlights, box guns, pistols, and other weapons. Patrol Chief Cheng Ruyao of the police station, upon hearing the news, immediately led the police to resist. However, the robbers were numerous, and the police were few, and their weapons were not as sophisticated as those of the robbers. After a brief clash, Patrolman Xu Bin was shot and killed on the spot. Patrol Chief Cheng Ruyao was shot in the chest and flanks, wounded, and retreated. The robbers then split up and searched for valuables. They first entered the Nanhuo shop opened by the Sheng family and robbed it, then proceeded to rob other houses, lasting for two hours, carrying away the stolen goods with shouts. The town chief Sheng Huanzhang's house was also broken into by the robbers. It is estimated that seven families, including Yin Mengkui, Zhuang Ruizhi, Zhang Youliang, Hu Shaokang, Li Musheng, and Sheng Shaoyu, suffered losses, including rice shops, Nanhuo shops, and meat shops, with an estimated total loss of over a thousand yuan. Yesterday morning (the 21st), Pan Yongqiang, the director of the Tinglin Public Security Branch Bureau, reported to County Magistrate Jin by long-distance telephone and immediately appointed Team Leader Chen, Secretary Wang, Examination Official Tao, and other seven people to go to the countryside for investigation. They inspected the robbed households and examined the body of the slain patrolman Xu Bin. It was confirmed that Patrol Chief Cheng Ruyao was shot, with injuries to the chest and waist, and was seriously injured. Today he was taken to the Ruose Hospital in Songjiang for treatment. According to the doctor's diagnosis, his life is in grave danger. Team Leader Chen, Secretary Wang, and others returned to Songjiang after completing their duties and have reported the details to the county government. It is reported that the robbers fled southeast into Fengxian County after the robbery, and they came from this route as well. It is feared that they are from the Tai Bao Ah Xu's troops, who are staying in the Qianjiawei area. Now the military and police in Tinglin, Yexie, Shanyang, and Caojing are all on high alert.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Discovery of a Large Gang of Bandits in Nanxu Town: The area of Nanxu Hengjing in Wujiang County is located on the shores of Taihu Lake and has always been a haunt for lake bandits. The former Taihu Bandit Suppression Headquarters was established in Suzhou and ordered the bandit suppression army, navy, police, and other forces to be stationed at various key points. They repeatedly engaged in fierce battles with the bandits and dispersed them. Therefore, bandit activity in Nanxu and other places disappeared. In almost a month, the local area was able to enjoy peace. Unexpectedly, after the bandit suppression army was withdrawn, the bandits regrouped and formed a large gang. On the 21st, they gathered in the Nanxu Hengjing area of Wujiang County, with about three hundred bandits and more than twenty boats, fully equipped with guns and weapons. They also sent bandit scouts to secretly land and investigate the local situation. They also threatened to loot the towns along the lake. The Nanxu and other public security branch bureaus immediately reported to the Wujiang County Government and discussed with the Third Battalion of the Fifth Regiment of the Second Central Training Brigade stationed in Wujiang to request the dispatch of a team to advance and suppress the bandits, in order to avoid disturbing the local area. After receiving the report, Battalion Commander Ma immediately telegraphed Brigade Commander Luo stationed in Suzhou for instructions. After receiving the telegram, Brigade Commander Luo telegraphed the battalion commander yesterday (the 22nd), instructing him to immediately dispatch a team to patrol and suppress the bandits. If they encounter bandits, they should strike hard and not allow any to escape.</p>
<p>County Government Takes Over the Sheng Family's Estate: Due to the merger of the county and city, the secretariat of the city government has not yet been closed and handed over. It was completely closed yesterday (the 22nd), and all files were transferred to the county government for takeover. All the Sheng family's property held by the city government has also been transferred one by one. The county government specially appointed Director Qiao of the Social Affairs Bureau to take over the Liuyuan Garden property. After the takeover, it will still be allowed to remain open.</p>
<p>Bandits Rob and Injure People in Lishu Township: In Shujingqiao, Lishu Township, under the jurisdiction of the county, at about 3:00 AM the day before (the 21st), a bandit boat suddenly arrived with more than ten bandits. They immediately landed and robbed several families, including Zhou Renshan, Zhou Xiaomao, Zhou Changda, and Zhou Shuiquan. During the robbery, Zhou Renshan's wife was stabbed by the bandits with a knife. The bandits then fled. After receiving the report, Huang Xiongxiang, the head of the public security branch bureau in charge, came to the city yesterday (the 22nd) to report to the county government and request an arrest.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Hu Battalion Achieves a Great Victory in Bandit Suppression in Yudong: After Yudong was repeatedly robbed by large groups of bandits, the Hu Battalion of the Fifth Division stationed in Erjia Town went to intercept them. The bandits fled to Huolong Town. The Hu Battalion's troops divided into three routes to encircle and suppress them. The artillery fire on both sides was very fierce. Over a hundred bandits were killed, and over two hundred surrendered. Three soldiers of the Hu Battalion were killed and two were wounded. The surrendered bandits were temporarily held at Sijia Dam. Battalion Commander Hu arrived in the city on the 21st to discuss follow-up measures with the county government and then went to Yudong to supervise the troops in pursuing the fleeing bandits.</p>
<p>County Government Requests Instructions on Handling Bandit Cases: County Magistrate Zhang stated that since the county court has been established, the county government no longer handles judicial matters. However, recently, bandit disturbances have occurred in the eastern townships, and the provincial and county police teams and the National Army have captured bandits and handed them over to the county government. He has specially submitted a report to the provincial government requesting instructions on how to handle the bandit cases.</p>
<p>Eastern Township Telephone Lines Temporarily Difficult to Repair: The eastern township long-distance telephone lines, extending as far east as Lusi Seaport, have had fifty telephone poles sawn down by bandits. Local military and political circles are raising funds to send craftsmen to repair them, and the work is currently underway. However, the telephone exchanges in Yudong and other districts have been completely destroyed, and it will be difficult to repair them in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Provincial Order to Inspect Mail: The provincial government, in accordance with a letter from the Provincial Rectification Committee, ordered the county government to increase the inspection of mail due to the rampant reactionary forces in the area and appointed Lin Kai as the director of mail inspection.</p>
<p>Sea Bandits Loot Ships on the Sea: The sea area of Tonghai, Chongming, and Hai'an counties is again turbulent. Sea bandits are looting merchant ships and fishing boats in the Lusi Pengjiatao area. It is reported that over forty ships have been looted. Zhu, the district chief of the Wusong Maritime Public Security Team, telegraphed the county magistrates of Tonghai and Chongming to send teams to cooperate in the suppression.</p>
<h3>Tongshan</h3>
<p>Zhang Xun's Rebel Ancestral Hall Ordered to be Used as a School Site: In this county, there is the ancestral hall of Zhang Xun, the leader of the restoration, the former residence of which is the site of the Provincial Xuzhou Women's Middle School Experimental Primary School, and the rear residence is the site of the Red Swastika Society. Last month, the principal of the school submitted a request to the Education Department to permanently use the former and rear residences of the rebel ancestral hall as the school site. The Education Department then submitted it to the Provincial Government Committee for discussion. It has been resolved to permanently use it as the school site. Today (the 21st), the Tongshan County Government was instructed to notify the Red Swastika Society to move out and report.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Re-survey of the Yichang Provincial Road Route: The Yichang Provincial Road is formed by the combination of the Xiyi Road (from Wuxi to Yixing) and the Xichang Road (from Wuxi to Changshu). The entire route starts from Yixing in the west, traverses this county, and ends in Changshu in the east. Since the general route was determined, it has been surveyed four or five times. The Construction Bureau of the Wuxi County Government originally planned to start recruiting labor to build the Xichang section in April of this year. However, due to the silkworm and farming seasons, the villagers along the route did not have time to respond to the recruitment. Therefore, County Magistrate Sun obtained approval from the Construction Department to postpone it until after the autumn harvest. Currently, the construction of bridge and culvert projects is planned first. Recently, Director Sun of the Construction Department believed that recruiting labor to build roads is a major construction project and that there are still many places that need to be re-surveyed on the route. He sent Jiang Housheng, the leader of the Provincial Highway Bureau's survey team, as the director of the Yichang Provincial Road re-survey. He came to Wuxi by car from the province the day before with three surveyors and eight laborers to carry out the re-survey. After arriving in Wuxi, he immediately contacted the Construction Bureau and will depart today or tomorrow to survey each section. In addition, the northern route of the Xiyi section of the Yichang Road is planned to utilize the Kaiyuan North Road from the city to Outang Bridge. Recently, Feng Genfu, Bian Zhenqing, and other residents of the Outang Bridge section and the Yangshuyuan section initiated the construction of a highway from Outang Bridge to Yangshuyuan as a branch road of the northern route of the Xiyi section. The route is eight li long, and the required funds are to be raised by the initiators. Once the funds are collected, they will submit a request to the county government for protection to facilitate transportation.</p>

<h3>President Prince Chichibu Attends</h3>
<p>22nd [of the month] - Tokyo Special Dispatch from This Newspaper: The Ninth Far Eastern Games will open tomorrow, Saturday. Approximately 600 athletes from the four participating countries will be present. Indian athletes are joining for the first time this year, participating in three sports. At noon on the opening day, Prince Chichibu, the president of the Games, will officiate the opening ceremony. Prime Minister Hamaguchi and other important figures will also attend. The ceremony will commence with twelve bell rings. The staff of the sports delegations from the four countries, led by a military band, will parade from the main gate to the venue, circling once around the field, and lining up in front of the command platform. Each team will have a flag bearer carrying their national flag. After the band plays the Japanese national anthem, Prince Chichibu will deliver an address, followed by the reading of a message from the Minister of Education. Next, Kishiseiichi will deliver the opening speech, and Prime Minister Hamaguchi will give a welcome speech. Finally, representatives from the four countries, including Zhang Boling, will deliver response speeches. The Games flag will then be raised on the main flagpole, completing the ceremony. The Emperor will not be in attendance.</p>
<h3>Must Visit Shizuoka Prefecture on Tour</h3>
<p>22nd [of the month] - Special Dispatch from This Newspaper: The Japan Athletic Association requested the Emperor's attendance at the Games. However, the Emperor is scheduled to tour Shizuoka Prefecture during the Games period, and preparations for his travel are already underway. Therefore, he will be unable to attend the venue.</p>
<p>British Embassy</p>
<p>Does Not Allow the Hanging of the Indian Flag</p>
<h3>Only the Flag of the Governor-General of India May Be Displayed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Indian Athletes Strongly Opposed, Resulting in Neither Flag Being Hung</p>
<p>22nd [of the month] - Reuters Tokyo: The Indian athletes at the Far Eastern Games are lodging at the YMCA with the Chinese and Philippine athletes. The Chinese and Japanese national flags, as well as the Philippine government flag, are flying high on the flagpole of the building. In addition, the eye-catching red, green, and white flag of the Indian National Congress was also displayed. After two days, Japanese sports authorities consulted with the British Embassy. They received a reply stating that the flag of the Governor-General of India was the proper emblem. Therefore, the tricolor flag was taken down and replaced with the flag of the Governor-General of India. The Indian athletes strongly opposed this, and so the Governor-General's flag was also taken down. Today, the flagpole only displays the flags of China, Japan, and the Philippines, with one pole left empty, representing India. The Indian athletes stated that during the opening ceremony on Saturday, they would rather enter the venue without a flag than display the British flag.</p>
<p>22nd [of the month] - Tokyo Special Dispatch from This Newspaper: Regarding the dispute over the Indian flag, the Japanese authorities, after consulting with the British Embassy, decided to hoist the British flag. After the Indian representatives arrived, they protested, demanding that the Indian revolutionary flag be displayed. The Japanese authorities were greatly embarrassed. Negotiations are currently underway to take down the British flag in order to appease the Indian athletes. The public is eagerly awaiting a decision.</p>
<p>Practice of the Japanese Volleyball Team</p>
<h3>China Has High Hopes</h3>
<p>Can Win the Championships in Football, Volleyball, and Basketball</p>
<p>The Baseball Team is Feared by the Japanese</p>
<p>Qiu Lin's Tennis Skills Are Also Excellent</p>
<p>20th [of the month] - Tokyo Special Dispatch from This Newspaper: Japan is quite confident in winning the championships in athletics, the all-around event, and swimming, three of the eight competitions at the Far Eastern Games. As for tennis, Japan's top players, such as Harada, Ota, Abe, and Sato (the elder), have already been dispatched to Europe and the West to compete in the Davis Cup. Therefore, this year, Japan's representatives will still have to rely on the second-tier players Sato (the younger) and Bui. The two were previously defeated in Shanghai, and the tennis championship was won by our country. However, this year's championship is the most difficult to predict. Although Bui previously defeated Lin Baohua in Southeast Asia, the Japanese are quite wary of Qiu Feihai's skills. In baseball, Japan's Oda, who excels in the triple jump at the All-Japan Athletics Championships, is on the team, but the Japanese dare not say they are confident, because our country's team cannot be underestimated. Our country has the best chance of winning the championships in football, basketball, and volleyball. At this Games, our country can win at least three championships, as can Japan. If the two countries are equal, then the number of silver medals won will determine the victor. At the last Games, China and Japan each won three championships, but the Japanese also won three silver medals in football, tennis, and swimming, while our country only won two silver medals in baseball and basketball, so we failed. Our country has great hopes for this Games and a good opportunity to avenge our defeat. The Philippines will likely not be optimistic this time. The life-or-death battle belongs to China and Japan.</p>

<p>(Jointly recorded by Dong Shouyi, Wang Xiliang, and Sun Sijing on the Ocean Maru)</p>
<p>Athletes Vie to Get a Glimpse of Moji Port</p>
<p>May 16</p>
<p>In the morning, after washing and dressing, the athletes went out. In no time, the deck became another colony for the athletes. They lined up and gazed around the ship. Suddenly, they heard a bell, indicating that breakfast was ready. Before long, they respectfully entered the dining hall from the high ground. Over a hundred people dined at the same time, solemnly and neatly, which was truly commendable. The Japanese servants attending to the guests praised them endlessly, exchanging greetings. After the meal, the athletes rested and enjoyed themselves, which was very pleasant. At noon, because the sea was as smooth as a mirror, many people came out of their cabins to gaze into the distance. They saw huge fish emerging and disappearing from the water. At this point, the athletes hastened to get a better look. At eleven o'clock, the Executive Committee of the Chinese Delegation to the Far Eastern Games held a meeting. Zhang Boling was elected as the Executive Chairman, and seven committee members were elected, including Hao Boyang, Ma Yuehan, Rong Qizhao, Qiu Jixiang, Dong Shouyi, Mo Yinggui, and Xu Zhendong. The committee will be fully responsible for external negotiations and all important internal affairs related to this Games. At the same time, the secretary-general informed us that the ship will arrive in Kobe at around 4 pm tomorrow (the 17th). A notice was posted regarding matters after disembarkation, in order to remind all athletes. The text is as follows: Attention Chinese Team Members (1) Arrive in Kobe at approximately 4 pm tomorrow (the 17th). (2) Dinner will be served at 6 pm (the dining location will be announced later). (3) Take the 8 pm night train to Tokyo on the 17th, arriving in Tokyo at around 9 am on the 18th. (4) Report the number of luggage pieces to each team leader so that luggage can be urgently shipped by luggage car. (5) Small pieces of luggage can be managed by yourselves. (Secretary-General Rong Qizhao, Deputy Secretary-General Xu Zhendong) After tea in the afternoon, the athletes of each team did some light exercises to stretch their muscles and bones. In the ship's main hall, the film "Lilacs Blooming Everywhere" by "Kemur" was shown. The content was set against the backdrop of the European War, depicting the conditions of the trenches during wartime and the happy ending of lovers. It was said to be a very beautiful story. By the time it was over, it was already eleven o'clock. As the athletes were about to return to their rooms to sleep, they suddenly heard a whistle. Looking into the distance, they saw brilliant smoke. They asked the captain and learned that Moji Port was in sight. The athletes eagerly rushed to get a better look, but at this time, coach Shu Hong repeatedly urged the athletes to return to their rooms, as it was time to rest.</p>
<p>Newly Built Swimming Pool</p>
<p>Track, swimming, baseball, tennis, volleyball, football, basketball and other items. Since the last Shanghai Games, track and field has been divided into two championships. The one that is independent of track and field is called the all-around event, or mixed competition, which includes five events, ten events, and 800-meter and 1600-meter relays. Since the creation of the all-around event, the Games have been divided into eight championships. The country with the most championships is the victor, ranking first. The method of determining the winners of each competition is as follows: In track and field and swimming, four athletes are selected for each event. First place gets five points, second place gets three points, third place gets two points, and fourth place gets one point. However, in the swimming relay race, first place gets ten points, second place gets six points, and third place gets four points. If only two countries participate in this competition, then there is no third place. Only the first and second places are selected. The scores are added up to determine the winner. In baseball, volleyball, and basketball, each country plays a round-robin tournament twice. In football, each country plays once to determine the winner. Tennis follows the Davis Cup regulations. Each country plays four singles and doubles matches. The country that wins three matches wins the championship. At the last Games, our country won all four matches. Therefore, this year, Japan and the Philippines must compete first. The winner of the Japan-Philippines match will then play our country in the final. The scoring of the all-around event is the same as that of the swimming relay. In the five-event, ten-event, and 800-meter and 1600-meter relays, four athletes are selected. First place gets ten points, second place gets six points, third place gets four points, and fourth place gets two points. The scores of the athletes selected from each country are combined and tallied to determine the winner. The country that wins the most of the eight championships will be awarded the Taisho Emperor Cup and will retain it permanently if it wins three consecutive times. (Ruan Weicun)</p>

<h3>Hangzhou Municipal Government Plans to Build a Public Stadium</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou Municipal Government believes that the physical fitness of its citizens is weak, and that the promotion of physical education is an urgent matter at the present time. It has been found that the city has only three sports fields: the Provincial Public Stadium, the Municipal Children's Stadium, and the newly built National Stadium. However, the city area is vast, and the number of citizens is increasing. Therefore, there should be more places for the public to exercise. The city government plans to build a municipal public stadium in a suitable location in the city to promote public amateur sports and reduce the bad habits of citizens. This project will be organized by the Education Department of the Municipal Government to facilitate its progress.</p>

<p>Secondary School League Basketball Game</p>
<h3>Nanyang Business School Defeats Shanghai Again</h3>
<p>The Nanyang Business School basketball team, after defeating Lida a few days ago, competed against Shanghai yesterday for the championship at the school's gymnasium. Both teams are famous and strong teams on the sea, and once they meet, they engage in a fierce battle, with many highlights. However, the Nanyang team has a more balanced talent pool, and all of them are experts in this field. Although Shanghai has famous generals such as Huang Yunli playing, they can only cry helplessly when faced with such a strong enemy. The result was 33 to 32, with Nanyang winning by only one point.</p>

<h3>Suzhou Education Uprising Expands</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Director, Following the Teachers and Staff, Resigns En Masse</p>
<p>The teachers and staff of Suzhou City had previously presented a mass resignation due to three months of unpaid education fees and the lack of a responsible statement from the competent authority. All school affairs were maintained solely by the principals. Now the situation has escalated. Although the County Education Bureau has taken over the Municipal Education, it has only promised to allocate the unpaid salaries gradually, and cannot determine a date for repayment in the shortest possible time. Although Yang Zhiting, who was appointed by the Provincial Education Department, is still in Suzhou, he has not made a responsible statement. The forty-odd principals of the city then resolved at a meeting on the evening of the 21st to resign en masse and return all appointment letters to the County Education Bureau, requesting that personnel be dispatched to take over each school immediately. At this point, the schools in Suzhou are completely in a state of anarchy. The outgoing principals' association held another meeting yesterday morning and resolved: (1) To issue a declaration to the public, explaining the difficulties of not being able to maintain the situation any longer, (2) To send telegrams to the provincial authorities to report the situation. The current Education Bureau has also telegraphed the provincial authorities to ask for instructions on how to handle the situation. However, after this trend expanded, both sides are moving to extremes, and it may be difficult to resolve the situation in the short term. Ten thousand students will be deprived of education, and the problem of students graduating in the summer will be affected.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Revises</p>

Regarding the members of the Ministry of Education's Phonetic Symbol Promotion Committee, of the nine previously appointed or delegated, two have now been added. Appointment letters were sent on the 21st. The list of committee members is as follows: Wu Zhihui, Zhao Yuanren, Lu Yiyan, Zhang Shiyi, Liu Luyin, Huang Zunzhou, Guo Youshou, Wu Yan'yin, Peng Baichuan, Dai Yingguan, Wang Ruichang.</p>
<h3>Educational Institutions to Adopt Uniform Official Document Format</h3>
<p>In order to reform the format of official documents, the Ministry of Education has formulated a set of measures for a uniform format of official documents for educational institutions (the document is lengthy, but the main points are to eliminate various conventional clichés in official documents, use new-style punctuation, and simplify the process). The Ministry of Education itself has implemented this since May 1st. Now, it has issued this set of measures to the educational administrative organs of all provinces and cities, instructing them to uniformly implement it starting from July 1st. The order reads: "The measures for a uniform format of official documents for educational institutions have been formulated by the Ministry and issued to the Shanghai China Book Company for publication and distribution. They should be implemented according to a set schedule. It is hereby determined that July 1st of this year will be the date for the implementation of these measures. All official documents exchanged by educational institutions from that date onwards shall be handled in accordance with these measures. In addition to separate orders, a copy of the measures and five special discount coupons are enclosed herewith. You are hereby ordered to comply and to instruct your subordinates to comply with these measures." This order.</p>

<h3>Five Chinese Directors of the Municipal Council Express Support for</h3>
<p>Recovering Educational Rights in the Concessions</p>
<p>The principals of four municipal schools, including Feihong, He'an, Bide, and Shuji, previously sent a letter to the five Chinese directors, including Yuan Ludeng, regarding the recovery of educational rights in the concessions, which has been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the five Chinese directors have expressed their support for the four municipal schools' proposal. Yesterday, they replied to the four school principals, stating: "We received your letter regarding the issue of Chinese children's education in the concessions and are deeply moved by your earnest concern. As directors of the Municipal Council, we are aware of our limited abilities and heavy responsibilities, and we fear that we may fail to live up to expectations. We are grateful for your elegant words and deeply touched by your sentiments. We share your concerns and will do our utmost within our power to gradually resolve the issue. We hope that you will continue to provide your wise counsel to correct our shortcomings." Addressed to Feihong Primary School, He'an Primary School, Bide Primary School, and Shuji Primary School. Signed by Yuan Ludeng, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinlu, Bei Songsun, and Liu Hongsheng on May 21st. It is reported that these schools believe there are still many misunderstandings abroad regarding the recovery of educational rights. They will issue a clear statement soon to address the criticisms in yesterday's Shanghai Taimes newspaper and have contacted various schools in the concession to organize groups for sustained efforts.</p>
<p>Municipal Education Bureau Investigates the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts</p>
<h3>and Notifies All Schools Not to Admit Expelled Students</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, stating: "Regarding compliance with orders, on the 16th of this month, the academy reported that students Sun Shoumin and others opposed Professor Liu Zhiping, assaulted General Affairs Director Ding and other faculty members, and passed a resolution to expel all faculty members, forcing General Affairs Director Ding to sign and hand over school administration, demanding their departure within a limited time. Representatives were dispatched to investigate, along with representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters. The students' assault and humiliation of teachers is an outrageous act that should be severely punished. The academy has reported the expulsion of twelve students, including Sun Shoumin. These expelled students should not be admitted to other schools to maintain academic integrity. General Affairs Director Ding Yuan and faculty member Liu Zhiping, holding important positions, failed to provide proper guidance and should also be suspended from their duties and replaced starting from the next semester. In addition to ordering all schools not to admit the offending students, you are hereby ordered to comply. After the end of this semester, Ding Yuan and Liu Zhiping should be suspended from their duties and replaced." This order.</p>

<h3>A Thought · Autumn · Water</h3>
<p>Even if a man has sincerely given the key to his heart to a woman and married her, he still hopes that after she opens the door to his heart, she will not shut it carelessly.</p>
<p>There are some husbands who are like certain old-fashioned ornaments: too precious to discard, but useless to keep. Women don't know how to dispose of them, so they simply put them back on. This is not because of their inherent value, but because of the deep affection they once felt for them.</p>
<p>The field of love is like a battlefield, and its changes are even more dramatic. When a man swears he never wants to see her again and returns home late at night, feeling lost, he understands it in his heart and falls soundly asleep. But when he wakes up the next morning, he wonders why she hasn't called to check on him.</p>
<p>Men are often so contradictory. Ten minutes ago, he swore he would never have anything to do with another woman, but ten minutes later, he pities himself, feeling the loneliness of being single. A man in love cannot eat, sleep, or work unless he suddenly realizes one morning that he is already in love with a woman and decides to abandon his pursuit of her.</p>
<p>A woman's character can be considered the gentlest in the world. But when she hears that her old love is unhappy after marrying, she cannot help but feel a little bit of satisfaction and pride in her heart.</p>
<h3>Gu Heyi · Awakening · Bewilderment</h3>
<p>Wu-men's Gu Heyi passed away on the 17th of this month. Heyi can be considered a great painter of our time. Among painters, we lost Wu Guandai last year, and now we have lost Gu Heyi. The bad news arrived, and I cannot help but sigh. I have written a small biography to publish in this column.</p>
<p>Heyi's surname is Gu, his given name is Linshi, his style name is Xijin, and Heyi is his alias. He was from Wu-men. The Yuan Dynasty painter Huang Zijiu had the alias Yifeng Shanren. Heyi adopted this story and took the alias Yifeng Tingzhang. His paintings did not have a specific teacher but were able to reach the pinnacle of artistry because of his family's rich collection and his deep dedication to copying. The Gu family was a prominent clan in Wu-zhong. Gu Zishan, a prominent gentleman of Wu-men, was his grandfather. Zishan was wealthy and had a great love for bronze inscriptions, calligraphy, and painting. His collection was unmatched in his time. He had as many as ten thousand fans with calligraphy and paintings by famous artists, which he stored in the Wan-shan Lou. Other items can also be imagined. Zishan also enjoyed hosting guests. He built the Yi Garden on the old site of Wu Bao'an's residence in the Hulong Street of Chang-men, inviting prominent officials and dignitaries to evaluate bronze inscriptions, calligraphy, and painting. At that time, great experts in bronze inscriptions, such as Wu Qingqing, and great calligraphers and painters, such as Wu Changshuo and Lu Lianfu, often lingered there, using the Yi Garden as a place to evaluate bronze inscriptions, calligraphy, and painting. As a result, Zishan's collection of bronze inscriptions, calligraphy, and painting was not only the richest of the time but also the most exquisite. When calligraphers and painters from various places came to Wu-men, Zishan would invite them to stay at the Yi Garden. Modern painters such as Gu Ruobo, Hu Sanqiao, Wu Qiunong, Ni Mogeng, and the Zhu Ren from Shanyin were all guests of the Yi Garden at that time. Heyi was friends with various contemporary painters, learning from each other, and he also took previous generations of painters as his teachers, constantly studying their works. Therefore, his paintings did not have a specific teacher, but he was able to understand the principles of painting in his heart and grasp the deepest mysteries. In the past, Wu Yushan obtained a painting by Huang Zijiu and treated it as his teacher, eventually becoming a great master of the early Qing Dynasty. Heyi's family collection of paintings included works from the Song and Yuan dynasties, with nothing lacking and everything exquisite. It is no wonder that he became a great painter of our time. Heyi's paintings were once as famous as Lu Lianfu's. Lianfu excelled in landscapes, flowers, figures, and ladies, especially landscapes and flowers. Heyi specialized in landscapes. Commentators said that Lianfu's flowers truly captured the essence of the Nan-tian School, unmatched at the time. Heyi's landscapes were a true transmission of the Southern Song Dynasty, also unmatched. From what I have seen of Heyi's paintings, his imitations of the various masters of the Song and Yuan dynasties all captured their spirit. He was truly a great painter. Lianfu passed away many years ago, and now Heyi has also departed. It is truly a pity.</p>
<h3>Garbage Island · Ji · Jin</h3>
<p>South of the Mississippi River in New York, there is a small island, about dozens of miles in area, called Chuckras. According to legend, it was formed by the accumulation of garbage. Because the river is wide and both banks are prosperous areas of New York City, the amount of garbage dumped into it each year reaches more than 14,000 tons. From 1891 to the present, it has gradually emerged from the water as layers accumulate and overlap. Grass and trees grow on it, and animals live on it, almost no different from ordinary islands. Those who see it cannot help but marvel.</p>
<p>The formation of the island is mostly due to major geographical changes, such as erosion by seawater or the rising and falling of land. There has never been one formed by artificial construction. Even coral, which is good at living on the seabed, carrying sand and transporting soil, gradually rises to become an island. This exists in the South Pacific, but it is rare. Although this island is not very large, it has been increasing in area over the years. It is said that it can be connected to the mainland, and the soil is fertile and rich in sulfur and saltpeter, making it easy to grow things. This also shows that there is no waste in the world and the land has surplus benefits.</p>
<h3>The Hospital Poisoning Case Within a Case · Bi · Ren</h3>
<p>Recently, a case of a hospital maid being poisoned to death has been widely reported in Guangzhou. The matter is quite bizarre and has attracted the attention of the authorities. There is a person from Shunde named Huang Mengyi who runs the Qingchun Hospital at No. 47 Guangda Road, practicing Western medicine. He only provides outpatient services and does not have inpatient care. The family consists of Huang, his wife Ms. Feng, and three maids.</p>
<p>On the 2nd of this month, the maid A'er suddenly collapsed in the kitchen after breakfast. Her face was pale, and she was vomiting blood. Her breathing stopped. Huang suspected poisoning and began investigating. The residence is about seven or eight zhang deep and connects to Renkui Fang in the back. There is an open space under construction on the left, and the windows are often open, secured with iron bars. Huang and his wife live in the third room, while the maids live in the last room. Later, water stains were found on the pillows in Huang's room, as if they had been shot in from outside the window. The pillows were boiled and tested, and they were found to contain a highly poisonous substance called hydrocyanic acid.</p>
<p>After the incident, Huang was summoned to the Public Security Bureau. Under questioning, Huang stated that he had no enemies. However, there was one suspicious incident. Before the case occurred, at 12:00 AM and 3:00 AM the night before, someone knocked on the door repeatedly, asking for emergency treatment. When asked who had recommended them, what the symptoms were, and what the address was, they were evasive. Huang refused them. The next morning, the case occurred.</p>
<p>The poisoned maid was 23 years old and had some beauty but was not married. She had worked for Huang for seven or eight years and was usually very careful. It is a pity that she was suddenly poisoned. It is reported that a cat in the hospital also died suddenly a few days ago. The authorities believe that the matter is bizarre and that there is a case within a case, so they have ordered the police to investigate thoroughly.</p>
<h3>Daqian's Exhibition Commemorating the Laying Down of His Brush · He · Tian · Jian</h3>
<p>Today, there are two Zhangs in Shanghai, no less than the two Lus in Luoyang in the past. Their talent is timeless, and their brilliance reflects each other. This is a grand event in the art world. Shanzai is known as the Tiger Madman because he is good at painting tigers. In fact, he is proficient in landscapes, figures, and flowers and insects. Daqian has the reputation of being Shitao reborn. Once he puts down his brush, the wind and thunder accompany him. Only Shitao is worthy of comparison. Is it Shitao or Daqian? It is difficult to distinguish. Why is Daqian known for laying down his brush today? There is a reason for this. Since Daqian made his name with calligraphy and painting, there has been almost no day without people coming to his door seeking his work. The saying that "the threshold is worn through" is no exaggeration. However, Daqian is naturally unrestrained and does not adhere to conventions. He paints whenever he is in the mood. Those who seek his work often limit him by size and format. Daqian finds this very difficult. Sometimes he wants to create a large painting but is forced to make it small, and sometimes he wants to create a small painting but is forced to make it large. Size is not enough to restrain him, and the accumulation of painting debts has killed his interest. Therefore, Daqian often says to me, "What is a great man incapable of doing? Must I be enslaved by brush and ink?" He has wanted to lay down his brush many times. Last year, Daqian traveled east by sea, going to Shenyang, Dalian, Korea, and Beiping before returning. There were already hundreds of requests for paintings in his home. Fortunately, the mountains and rivers were before his eyes, the wind and clouds were under his wrist, and nature provided the drafts. His inspiration was abundant. He managed to offset the painting debts accumulated over the year. So he declared, "How can I bear to be a slave to paper and brush?" The act of laying down his brush was realized. His teacher, Zeng Nongran, heard about it and said to him, "Your name is already established. Once you lay down your brush, there must be a commemoration." Hence, there was the exhibition commemorating the laying down of his brush. When I heard about it, I said with emotion, "The world is suffering because it cannot gain fame, but Daqian, having already gained fame, looks away and abandons it. What will Daqian do? Being a slave to paper and ink is not the business of a man. However, Daqian's contempt for fame and fortune is beyond the reach of ordinary people." It is reported that the exhibition is held at the Ningbo Fellow Association. There are more than a hundred pieces on display. The collaborative fan paintings and twelve golden hairpins made by Shanzai and Daqian are also on display. The exhibition begins on the 21st. Since the beginning of the history of our art world, there have been few instances of someone becoming famous and then leaving. Daqian's actions are unprecedented. How can we not commemorate it? Therefore, I have written this article to record it.</p>
<h3>A Western Beauty with Bobbed Hair and Cheongsam · Lu · Bing</h3>
<p>The other day, I went from Xiaguan into the city for business and saw two rickshaws speeding towards me at the intersection of Banbian Street. I stood on the side of the road to wait for them to pass. I then saw that the passengers were not Chinese but Western women. One of the women was about forty years old, with a kind face, like a missionary. What was different was that her hair was tied in a bun, and she was wearing a gray silk cheongsam with a dark skirt. At first glance, it was difficult to tell. But her facial features and skin color revealed that she was a foreigner. I asked a friend about it, and he said that people in Beijing knew her quite well. She had been in China for more than ten years, and she was a senior female pastor. She could speak fluent Chinese and liked the comfort of Chinese clothing, so she was often seen not wearing Western clothes. According to my friend, near Xuanwu Lake and Qingliang Mountain, many Western young women who like to stroll around can be seen. Their eyes are blue, and their skin is fair. They imitate the current fashion, with bobbed hair and cheongsams, and their styles are graceful and charming. Some people look at them with the same gaze as Liu Zhen, and they are also generous and have no shyness. It is rumored that many of the Western women wearing Chinese clothes are family members of students studying abroad. They are stationed in the capital, so they accompany their husbands here. Having lived in China for a long time, they have been influenced by what they have seen and heard, and they have become Sinicized. This is not surprising. However, Western women who travel to China do have a growing tendency to like Chinese women's clothing. I have recorded this as a temporary anecdote.</p>
<h3>Other Records of Hongdu · Xu · Chengyu</h3>
<p>Each province has its own local taboo. People from Jiangxi are called "old acquaintances," while the name "wax chicken" is even older. During the Ming Dynasty, Li Shi once teased Xia Guixi with "Wax chicken alone has the taste of Jiangxi." Guixi immediately responded with "Horse bandits can empty the Hebei crowd." Li was from Beiping, and horse bandits were the local taboo there. When Yan Fenyi was in power, his fellow villagers went to congratulate him on his birthday. Fenyi was tall and imposing, and he stood tall. The people bowed and paid their respects. Gao Zhongxuan glanced sideways and laughed. Fenyi asked why. Zhongxuan said, "I just remembered Han Changli's poem, 'The big rooster comes proudly, and the little rooster waits respectfully,' which made me laugh." The crowd also laughed loudly. However, the origin of the colloquialism is unknown. A man from Jiangxi wrote a lantern poem on the Lantern Festival, saying: "Tassels are colorful and dazzling, and people come to see the lanterns on the thirteenth. Villagers meet and ask each other, why is our hometown called wax chicken?"</p>
<p>Jiangxi has a custom of renting wives. Wealthy families who have no sons often rent a fertile woman from poor families for a period of time. They pay according to the time. When the time comes, regardless of whether a son is born, she returns to her husband without any reluctance. Sometimes, the period is until a son is born. As soon as a son is born, she leaves. Sometimes, poor people have no way to make a living, so they lead their wives to seek rentals from wealthy families. Or, due to debt, they even have their wives go to the creditors. They return when the period is up. In recent years, although provinces and counties have strictly prohibited this, it has not been completely eradicated in remote areas.</p>

<p>Originally, it is common to catch a cold and cough. There is nothing strange about it. Coughing can be very severe due to catching a cold, and it will get better after a while. However, Liu Xing-shu's cough is an incomplete cough, just a light and casual cough. It is commonly called a "half-sound cough." That kind of cough is a symptom of lung disease. It must be that there is something wrong with his lungs, and then this cough sound is produced. His lungs feel a little itchy or furry, and then he makes this cough sound in his throat. He often doesn't notice it himself, but others hear it very clearly. Zuo Shi-chen sees that Liu Xing-shu's cheeks are flushed, and he thinks that Xing-shu's lung disease is very deep, perhaps already in the second or third stage. However, he still goes to the bookstore every day and to the newspaper office every day, never missing a day of class. Zuo Shi-chen doesn't know what to say, but he advises him to take care of his body and to rest when he can. There is an old saying: "As long as the green hills remain, there will always be firewood to burn." It is harmful to the body to overwork. Liu Xing-shu said, "I am very grateful for your words. I also want to rest, but my circumstances do not allow me to rest. There is nothing I can do about it." After a pause, he said, "I think a person is cheap. One year, I didn't work for three months, just casually read a book, and I became decadent. At that time, my body felt lazy and dull, and it wasn't any better than now. Now, from morning till night, I don't have a moment of free time, and the days pass like this. Some people say that a person's brain is like a machine, it needs to be running every day. If it is abandoned and not used, the brain will rust like a machine." He smiled and said to Zuo Shi-chen, "I have translated ninety percent of my detective novel. In ten more days, I can finish it. This thousand dollars is unexpected, it came from out of the blue. Although I have stayed up so many nights, it is earned by my own hard work, like a craftsman making something. I seem to be very proud of myself." "I have already decided how to use this thousand dollars. This was not in the budget. I want to use it all to buy some jewelry. All young women like jewelry as decorations. This is also a natural and common thing. Moreover, their family's daughter, although she can't be said to be dripping with jewels, must have a few decent decorations. Marrying a wife now is different from before. Before, you married a wife and hid her at home, and she would never show her face or be seen by others. Now that is not possible. People often invite the wife along with the husband to parties. You have to take your wife with you. There are so many wives competing there. The beautiful wife attracts everyone's attention, as if the husband is glorified. The not-so-beautiful wife is, frankly speaking, overshadowed."</p>

<h3>The Elusive Gold Market</h3>
<p>Fluctuations Remain Large ·· Result: Drop of 1.6 Taels</p>
<p>Silver Tax Issue Unresolved. Yesterday's gold market was still in a state of chaotic uncertainty, advancing and retreating, making it difficult to predict. The morning market was turbulent, with a change of as much as nine taels. The afternoon market calmed down slightly, with a difference of only a few cents per tael, but the trend was downward. The foreign exchange rate was reduced by half a point, but internally it seemed loose, with banks continuing to sell. Trading among firms varied, with Zhi Feng Yong, Fu Chang, Shun Li, and Wan Xing selling, while Yuan Mao Yong and hedging firms were buying. However, the psychology of all firms remained apprehensive and uneasy. From the early morning, there was a large-scale pullback, and due to the silver tax case not having any developments, the market opened high. Afterwards, sellers were very active, gradually moving downstream, rapidly falling to a low peak, plummeting by a large margin of eight or nine taels. This was due to the situation where exchange rates were effectively being loosened covertly. From 524 taels, it suddenly fell to within 516 taels, and then buyers rushed in, immediately pushing it back up three or four taels. However, the environment was confusing, and weakness reappeared. In the afternoon market, Heng Xing and Sheng Da sold, while buyers were scattered, and the market stabilized, with fluctuations only amounting to a few cents per tael. Later, it hovered around 517 taels.</p>
<p>The market opened with a jump of 3.5 taels. British silver fell by 3/16, while silver prices only decreased by 1/8. The opening price for July futures was 522 taels, an increase of 3.5 taels. The gross market initially strengthened but then weakened, retreating from 24.5 taels to around 21 taels. Initial notices were posted, with reductions of 1.25 for foreign exchange, 2.5 jiao for US dollars, and an increase of 0.625 for Japanese silver, then at 21.3 taels, which then decreased to 20.8 taels. Internal exchange rates remained stable. June's interbank trading was at 9 pence 8125, which increased to 22.1 taels after a few minutes, then suddenly weakened. Large firms leaned towards selling, mainly because exchange rates had loosened. June's interbank trading was at 9 pence 9375, and Japanese silver could be settled at 1.11375 taels, and the gold market seemed to be declining rapidly, plunging by six taels. At 10:30, it was only at 15.5 taels, then firms rushed to buy, jumping up four taels in just over twenty minutes, reaching 19.34 taels at 11:00. At noon, the downward trend returned, and sellers were tireless, reaching 17.2 taels at noon. After the market closed, it fell slightly more than one tael, which was quite chaotic and difficult to predict.</p>
<p>The afternoon market gradually became sluggish. The afternoon market opened with a drop of 1 tael and zero cents, at 516 taels, followed by 15.3 taels, due to the lower opening of goods. Shortly after, it gradually rose by more than two taels, reaching 17.89 taels at 2:45, with some buying activity. Mitsui bought nearby Japanese silver futures at 1.116875 taels, while British silver futures were traded nearby at 9 pence 875. Afterwards, it suddenly became sluggish, as sellers appeared strong on the trading floor. HSBC sold September British silver futures at 10 pence 125, and June Japanese silver futures were settled at 1.11625 taels, resulting in a drop of one or two taels. However, there were fluctuations of around one tael. At 4:00, it was at 16.12 taels, and then Wan Xing, Shun Li, and others bought in, returning to a high of over one tael, at 17.8 taels. However, hedging papers were being sold, so it was difficult to gain a foothold, and it fell to 16.5 taels, and finally to 17.1 taels. At the closing time of 4:30, it was at 16.9 taels, continuing to fall by 1.6 taels compared to the previous day. The maximum price in both the morning and afternoon markets was 24.5 taels, and the minimum price was 15.3 taels, a difference of 9.2 taels. Looking back, it had already been changed to 544.8 taels, reduced by 27 taels, and later reduced by 21 taels. Adding the ledger registration fee was a total of 17 taels. Goods opened at 23.5 taels in the morning, closed at 16.4 taels at noon, and 15.9 taels in the afternoon, with a closing price of 16.2 taels.</p>
<p>Different Intentions Among Traders. Transactions by various firms included Zhi Feng Yong, Fu Chang, Yuan Sheng, Yuan Da, Yuan Cheng Yong, and Yuan Yu Yong, who all sold. Da De Cheng, Yang Chang, Yu Da, and Fu Xing Yong traded with inconsistent movements. Shun Li and Wan Xing sold more than they bought. Cheng Feng Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Chun Fa Yong, Sen Chang Yong, and Fu Yu all bought. In the afternoon, Heng Xing, Sheng Da, Yuan Tai, Zhi Feng Yong, and Yi Yu all sold, while Shun Li, Wan Xing, Xie Da, and Fu Chang bought. Tai Xing Yu Da and Kun He had occasional movements in and out. The Dalian gang bought 500 articles and sold 1,500-1,600 in the morning. In the afternoon, they bought 1,000 articles and sold only several dozen. The Guangdong gang sold about 2,000 articles, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Rates Reduced by Half a Point</h3>
<p>British and American Exchange Rates Tighten and Then Loosen</p>
<p>Japanese Exchange Rates Vary by Half a Cent</p>
<p>Yesterday, both British and American silver markets reduced rates. Foreign buying and selling were inconsistent. Yokohama and Kobe remained quiet. HSBC's foreign exchange listings have all been reduced by half a point, with British silver reduced by 0.125 to 1 shilling 9 pence 625, setting a new record. US dollars were reduced by 0.25 to 43.75 yuan. French francs were reduced by 5 yuan to 1,117 yuan. Indian rupees were reduced by 0.75 to 121 rupees. The Japanese-Western currency was reduced by 0.75 to 108.75 shield. Singapore increased by 0.75 to 128.5 taels. German currency decreased by 1 yuan to 183.5 marks. Japanese silver increased by 0.625 to 1.112875 taels. Hong Kong remained unchanged at 80.75 taels. Internally, silver prices were tight and then loosened. The afternoon was stable, but the situation was one of covert reduction and a lack of strengthening. Yesterday, there were company ships exporting, and foreign merchants were shipping many goods abroad, so they needed to sell exchange bills, and banks were eager to sell. However, Japanese silver remained firm, but the buying and selling prices differed greatly and were chaotic and inconsistent, not following the price of silver, and almost becoming proportional. The gold market was still confused, with twists and turns of nine taels throughout the day. The result was lower, so the closing price of the shilling was higher by 0.0625 compared to the noon price of the previous day, and the US dollar was higher by 0.125. Japanese silver was actually higher by 0.375, but there was no formal market situation. Transactions of British silver totaled over 200,000 pounds, with Chinese merchants buying 40%. Banks such as Shanghai, Sino-French, Chase, and HSBC all sold. The banks had traded over 100,000 pounds among themselves. HSBC, Mackrow, Oliphant, and Chase sold positions, but Mitsui's appetite for buying was strong. The Guangdong gang and Sheng Da sold, and Chinese banks absorbed them. US dollar transactions were light, and Japanese silver had settled over 1 million yuan, sold by Mitsui and the Mainland, and absorbed by Shanghai. The market atmosphere seemed to be hovering, it is said.</p>
<p>The internal British exchange rate fluctuated by about 0.1875. In the morning, the asking price for May was 1 shilling 9 pence 6875, June 75, July 8125, and August 875. The buying price was increased by 0.0625. At noon, the asking price for May was 9 pence 8125, with June, July, and August each increased by 0.0625. The afternoon was the same as the noon.</p>
<p>The internal US exchange rate fluctuated by half a yuan. In the morning, the asking price for May was 43.875 yuan, June 44 yuan, July 44.125 yuan, and August 25. The buying price was increased by 0.125. Transactions were rarely seen. At noon, the asking price for May was 44.3125 yuan, June 4.4375, July 5625, and August 6875. The buying price was still increased by 0.125. The afternoon was the same as the noon.</p>
<p>The internal exchange rate for East Asian currencies was chaotic and inconsistent, with a difference of as much as half a cent between buying and selling prices. Chinese merchants slightly inclined towards settlement. From the early market, the asking price for this month was 1 tael 1 qian 2 fen, and the buying price was 1 tael 1 qian 1 fen and a half. June was 1 fen 75, July was 1 fen 375, and August was 1 fen 125. At noon, the asking price for May was 1 fen 625, June was 375, July was 1 fen, and August was 075. The buying price was reduced by half a cent. The afternoon closing price for this month was 1 fen 875, June was 625, July was 25, and August was 0875. The buying price was still reduced by half a cent, it is said.</p>
<h3>Bar Silver Frequently Shows New Low Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to the London telegraph, bar silver turned downward again, with the trend not diminishing compared to before, and showing new records that had never been seen before. The near term decreased by 0.1875, to 18 pence 625 (equivalent to 1 shilling 10 pence), and the far term also decreased by 0.1875, to 18 pence 5625. Both sellers in India and China were present in the market, and then Indian speculators bought in at low prices. Buyers were satisfied, and the market closed calmly. Furthermore, the New York telegraph indicated that US silver prices continued to fall and saw new low prices, with the spot price falling by 0.125, to 4 jiao 0125. The British to US dollar exchange rate increased by 0.09375, and the US to British pound exchange rate increased by 0.125, both to 4 dollars 8 jiao 6 fen 125. The Japanese to US dollar exchange rate remained at 49 dollars 4375, and the British to Japanese yen exchange rate remained at 2 shillings 040625. The British-Shanghai shilling returned, shortening by 0.1875, to 1 shilling 10 pence. The spot price in Bombay increased by 1 ounce, to 53 rupees. Furthermore, the Reuters telegram that arrived on that day did not have any noteworthy developments, and the telegram from the news agency also did not have any changes, it is said.</p>
<h3>Securities Trading Flat, "96" Bonds Recover Slightly</h3>
<p>(Beiping) In the morning market, "96" bond spot trading was at 16.55, closing at 16.35, with 130,000 units sold. "7 Long" spot trading was at 8.37, with 5,000 units sold.

<h3>Reorganization Bonds Rise Significantly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local securities market, only reorganization bonds saw buying and selling in the spot market, and charitable bonds once opened in the afternoon market, but there were no other transactions. The total volume was 31,000 yuan. The futures market continued to be extremely lively, with transactions reaching over 12.8 million yuan in the morning and afternoon. As for the trend of bond prices, only reorganization bonds fluctuated greatly. In the first round in the morning, demand was very strong in the market, but large firms did not sell large amounts at once. The current month futures rose to 62.2 yuan, and the June futures reached 62 yuan, continuing to rise by over 2 yuan compared to the previous day. Afterwards, due to the price rising too high, it triggered large firms to sell, and the price gradually loosened. However, the afternoon trend was still quite strong. As a result, spot prices rose by 2 yuan compared to the previous day, and futures also rose by 1.56 yuan. Other than the military reduction next month, which saw a greater rise in the morning market, the rest were hovering, with very slight fluctuations, it is said.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Sales Improve Greatly</h3>
<p>Large-Scale Purchases by Sichuan and Guangdong Gangs</p>
<p>The yarn market initially strengthened and then weakened. The sales of current yarn were smooth, with large-scale purchases by the Sichuan and Guangdong gangs. Selling prices remained stable, but Japanese yarn rose slightly, so the market trend did not fully strengthen. If various gangs could continue to purchase continuously, yarn prices would have a chance to rise. However, stagnant goods were not selling, and the global cotton market was not performing well. Although "Three Goods" yarn fell due to exchange rates, the decline was too severe. In the afternoon, Heng Da factories suddenly sold this month's yarn, and the market atmosphere suddenly loosened, leading to weakness in distant months.</p>
<p>Heng Da Factory Sold Futures Yarn in Batches This Month In the morning market for futures yarn, the sentiment was still tight. The issue of increased factory taxes caused buyers to follow each other, and all months rose by 1, 2, 3, or 4 cents. The current month was unchanged. In the afternoon, it was heard that current sales were good, and the situation was still tight, rising by 1 cent. In the second and third rounds, there was a sudden fall, with Heng Da factories selling 100 bales of yarn per round this month, and many long positions also closed out. The market fell by 2, 3, 4, or 5 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 9,100 bales. The closing prices for the marked tenders are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>(Table: Marked Tender Closing Prices, Change, Account Balance)</p>
<p>| Month | Price   | Change | Account Balance |</p>
<p>| ----- | ------- | ------ | --------------- |</p>
<p>| August  | 153.2 | Down 1.2 | 1,450          |</p>
<p>| May   | 152.5 | Down 2.2 | 28,050        |</p>
<p>| September | 153.9 |       | 12,300        |</p>
<p>| June  | 152.6 |       | 23,060        |</p>
<p>| October | 154.3 |       | 37,550        |</p>
<p>| July  | 152.8 |       | 12,640        |</p>
<p>Current Yarn Opened at 6,000 Bales Sales Improved Greatly The Guangdong gang purchased quite smoothly. The total amount of current goods purchased by various gangs throughout the day was 3,935 bales. Sichuan advanced futures 1,500 bales, and peers advanced 550 bales. The market was flat. The most purchases by customer gangs were from the Guangdong gang, totaling 1,840 bales. In addition, Sichuan advanced 1,510 bales, Xiamen advanced 45 bales, the interior advanced 85 bales, Qinhuangdao advanced 45 bales, Shantou advanced 135 bales, Qingdao advanced 85 bales, Niuzhuang advanced 50 bales, Yunnan advanced 72 bales, and other miscellaneous gangs advanced 70 bales. The majority of goods purchased by the Sichuan and Guangdong gangs were opened by factories, it is said.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Downtrend Difficult to Reverse</h3>
<p>Yesterday, telegraphs from the US regarding cotton showed mixed ups and downs. The local cotton market was soft and unremarkable. Japanese merchants were delivering this month's goods, and recipients were lacking, so the situation became more illusory, and the downtrend intensified. However, the Hubei gang and retail investors held on to distant futures, refusing to loosen. However, a certain manufacturer continued to sell short for October, and the number of bales was quite large. The current cotton business was quite quiet.</p>
<p>The Market Was Flooded with Recent Deliveries of Hubei Cotton The morning market opened with a strong position due to buyers holding tight. However, those delivering this month's goods flooded the market, falling by 5 cents, and distant months rose by 1 cent. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere suddenly loosened, and buyers were lacking, falling by 5 cents to 1 cent. The total transaction volume for the day was 27,500 dan. The closing prices for the Hubei cotton benchmark are recorded on the left:</p>

<p>Actual Sales Became More Silent The current cotton business was depressed, but conditions in producing areas differed, and prices were not easily loosened, so sellers did not show excessive willingness to concede. The source was only 20 bales of Yao cotton, with 90 pieces of Shaanxi cotton opened, advanced by Sanrenji, at a price of 35.35 taels, delivered at the current goods warehouse.</p>

<h3>Silk, Tea: New Cocoons from Wujin and West Town Have Entered the Market</h3>
<p>In various cities and towns of Wujin, there has been unrest this year, and farmers have been hesitant to raise silkworms in spring. The cocoon affairs in the west town are even worse than in the east town. Furthermore, due to unfavorable weather, both early and late cocoons have been affected. New cocoons from the west town have entered the market, and those from the east town have also begun clustering. Cocoon merchants in areas such as Lucheng, Sanhekou, Houyu, Menghe, and Benniu will set the scales today. New cocoons from the east town will also be seen in 24-25 days. Cocoon prices are expected to be as high as 60 yuan, with slight increases for improved varieties of high-quality cocoons. It is estimated that the cocoon production in Wujin this year will be at most 40-50% of the usual level.</p>
<h3>The "Raise High, Lower Low" Tea Market of Foreign Firms</h3>
<p>Qi Tea Rose Sharply to "Nian Liang" ·· Over 2,700 Chests Traded Yesterday, in the local tea market of foreign firms, British firms such as Jardine Matheson, Union Insurance, Tianyu, and Jinlong were increasingly eager to buy high-end Keemun black teas. Nearly all arriving goods were quickly sold, and the market situation was trending upwards. The total trading volume for the city reached 2,747 chests, and the market price opened at 225 taels, with the average price rising by another 20-30 taels compared to the previous day. However, foreign tea merchants rarely inquired about low-end black teas such as those from Wenzhou and He Kou, as well as green teas from local tea growers. The tea market of "raising high and lowering low" has become a natural trend, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Market Price of Qi Floating "Three Character" Tea Is Plummeting</h3>
<p>Keemun floating black tea, the top two grades have been purchased by various firms and there are no concerns about unsold goods. The third grade tea mountain households are also preparing batches for sale, but tea firms lack cash and cannot purchase in large quantities. Since the tea money robbery case in Liukou, many have been afraid to go to Jingdezhen to purchase tea. Most firms that have not arrived at the He Kou tea office have temporarily closed their warehouses, and tea sales have therefore been reduced and stagnant. In addition, the price of rice in Keemun has skyrocketed, at four and a half sheng per yuan. Workers at various tea firms are struggling to feed themselves, so they have shortened their periods and focused on purchasing fewer goods. Recently, the market price of Keemun floating "three character" black tea has fallen by 20 yuan, and few people are inquiring about it. The future of the tea market seems bleak, it is said.</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market Sales Become Slightly More Active</h3>
<p>Fresh Goods Are the Firmest</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were fewer than ten boats arriving at the Zhabei dock, and market sales became more active. As the weather cleared up slightly, various stores urgently needed to purchase small amounts. The demand for northern japonica rice was strong, but only fresh japonica rice was desirable. Prices rose slightly, but there was nothing noteworthy about old rice. Thin rice was scarce and only a small amount was available, with top-grade rice reaching 20 yuan in Guanwai. The sheep du and pointed foot variety was extremely firm, and although transactions were rare, the market was stable. The sales of high-grade "Tongbian" rice were slightly better, while mid-range rice was still sluggish, so the price fluctuated by one yuan, with high-grade at 18.5 yuan and mid-range falling by one yuan. The only movement in sales throughout the day was from customer gangs, so the market lacked ups and downs.</p>
<p>Shipments arriving at the Shanghai South River were not strong, and sales in the main street were inconsistent. Some "Xibei" japonica rice was already priced above 20 yuan, but most transactions were only for goods priced at 19.67 yuan, and the market was slightly firmer than the previous day. The sales of "Su Tong Ji" japonica rice were average. The "Tongchong" gang had slight expectations due to transportation issues, so sales were only moved marginally. The high-grade price was around 18 yuan. The early thin rice varieties such as "Lian Tang" and "Qing Jiao" from the South gang were also scarce here, and both supply and demand were low, so buyers raised prices, with行情帶緊 about half a角. Goods such as sheep tips were appearing and disappearing, with few transactions. The market shape was still uncertain, and the "變陰元" remained mediocre, with customer gang purchases quiet and prices unchanged, opening high around 18 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Rise Moderates</h3>
<p>Short Positions Have Been Covered ·· Momentum Is Difficult to Regain</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market presented a hovering appearance. Since the sharp rise this month, most of the non-industry shorts have gradually painfully covered their positions, and the target of those squeezing shorts has therefore relaxed slightly. In terms of customer sales, although Tianjin quotes were still around 3.78 yuan, current Shanghai flour was no longer worthwhile, so although inventories were low, demand was not very urgent. The situation in distant months, especially June, was still tight, as manufacturers feared they would have to continue to hold firm as half of the batch would be old flour, and the market in the future, was feared not to be able to convert small in the short term. By July, it would all be new flour, and if the wheat harvest was fruitful, manufacturers would no longer be able to hold firm, as their planning for the year could no longer use strategies that were suicidal. As a result, this month was slightly better than the previous day by 0.0025 yuan, June was unchanged, July was down 0.005 yuan, August was down 0.0025 yuan, September was up 0.005 yuan, and October was up 0.0025 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Current Wheat Opened at 4,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Standard Longs Released ·· Slightly Softened</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, the market for each month, wheat prices were again small by二四角 and the weather, but stopped the rains and therefore people were softer, and floating more seen profit has been abundant, and they have a good opportunity to sell, the June July August September smaller than the previous day on a fraction, the open of the afternoon session as June was 补空 quite劲 market, each the other months, probably the market is circling, and this may be that until a new wheat harvest is actually obtained and they have confidence that there are major上落, the result of June, July is smaller by one cent. Aug is smaller by two cents, September is up by a cent. Current wheat is Chen wheat is the last order, customers seem hard to last擯, and therefore, the market is stable, Clear River Wheat and South Xuzhou wheat Xu wheat and Bengbu wheat opened at five taels and one qian and seven fen, Shaoxing wheat opened at five taels and one qian and two fen and a total of 4,000 were sold by福新, it is said.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Quanzhou Large "Pao Yuan" Reached a Short Market</h3>
<p>Xiamen Candied Orange Slices Have Resumed Sales</p>
<p>Quanzhou "Pao Yuan" local goods were indeed scarce, so shipments arrived slightly, but sales in Shanghai have been sluggish recently due to the impact of the times, and as the mold season is not far away, most buyers are waiting and watching, and the trend is very ordinary, it is said.</p>
<p>Xiamen candied orange slices were previously stocked for a long time due to poor sales, and local producers stopped manufacturing early due to this. More recently, buyers felt that sources were scarce, and胃 slightly dense and 号盘 all经开 out, the price remained 15 taels.The market appeared stable, it is said.</p>
<h3>Gray-White Cloth Gradually Improving</h3>
<p>The recent firm trend in actual sales is still slow. The彩球阳鹤and other trademarks continued to gain2 1/2 yuan yesterday as the colored and dyedcloth reengaged the market. The Sichuan Gang traded Yindanshi Blue and Haichang Blue Gray-White Cloth (200+ pieces) and the Niuzhuang and Tianjin gang searched the existing supply in the market. This has created a bullish mentality for those holding the goods. Sales of細斜 were smooth. The Lantou Gang (廣帮) has already bought 50 pieces of 蓝双鱼 and陽鶴. However, coarse布重磅is falling. Nine Pound Cloth again 小二分半, Mao Mao聚寶盆 only opened at four taels零七分半.</p>

<h3>Grain Commission</h3>
<p>Please Exempt Rice Tax First</p>
<p>Resolution of the Standing Committee Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Grain Commission held its fifteenth standing committee meeting the other day. Xu Shuji, Huang Gutong, and commissioners from various bureaus and industries attended. Feng Liutang proposed that the price of rice is high and the people's food is difficult to obtain, and that various taxes on rice should be exempted to provide relief. It was considered that the price of rice is expensive, and the government should be requested to exempt taxes to protect the people's food. Moreover, checkpoints along the way often require tickets, which hinder transportation and cause great harm. After discussion, everyone agreed that the government has already made a determination to abolish the tax, and it is scheduled to be implemented on October 10th. At this time of high grain prices, the advance exemption of rice tax has limited losses and great benefits. It was resolved to submit a request for instructions. Furthermore, in view of the abundance of foreign rice, if no attention is paid to this year's rice crop, the future food shortage will be even more worrying. The various committees of the association also plan to submit their opinions to the municipal government for review.</p>
<h3>Letter Requesting Adoption</h3>
<p>Legitimate Aspirations of Chinese People</p>
<p>Letter from the Chinese Taxpayers' Association to Mr. Feitang</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to Mr. Feitang, consultant of the Public Works Bureau, yesterday. The letter is quoted below: "To the esteemed Mr. Feitang, Our association sent letters to various organizations on April 9th to solicit opinions on the Shanghai issue. Now, the received replies are attached for your review. The opinions expressed in the letters are all legitimate aspirations of the Chinese people and should be adopted as much as possible. If there are other replies in the future, they will continue to be sent."</p>
<h3>Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>Studying the Sino-Japanese Agreement</p>
<p>Request to Announce the Negotiating Policy</p>
<p>After the Sino-Japanese treaty was signed by Foreign Minister Wang Rutang, although the Legislative Yuan was somewhat dissatisfied and raised questions, the storm quickly subsided after the Foreign Minister's personal explanation. Yesterday, the Shanghai Shipping Association and the Chinese Merchant Mariners Association, two groups, expressed doubts about the content of the new treaty. They submitted a request to announce the future negotiating policy of the shipping treaty, with many warnings. The document states: "Since the Daoguang and Xianfeng periods of the late Qing Dynasty, our country has repeatedly been forced to sign treaties that humiliate the country and infringe upon its rights. In addition to ceding land and paying indemnities, national taxes have been restricted, and foreign ships have been allowed to navigate inland. Even the tonnage tax on merchant ships has been unified. As a result, various countries have relied on this talisman, with their strong economies and surplus commodities, to compete with our country. Our country's industry and commerce, from the beginning to the present, have not escaped the status of handicrafts and small-scale machine industry. How can they compete with advanced countries? Therefore, foreign goods are becoming more and more abundant, and the hope for the development of domestic industry and commerce is becoming less and less. If industry and commerce are not developed, how can shipping be revitalized? Moreover, since the foreign goods of various countries are selling well, their economic power is becoming more inflated. Therefore, they have turned their attention to competition in the shipping industry, such as building new ships, reducing transportation costs, and engaging in competition in every way. Our government has no tax laws to protect merchants, and the ports are wide open. The economy and ships of the Chinese people are insufficient. Even if they want to compete, it is difficult to do so. The situation has already been formed, and even a great sage can do nothing. Alas, the Chinese people have been bound and moaning, exploited and oppressed, by such unequal treaties for more than eighty years. Anyone with a little knowledge and a little blood will be heartbroken and sigh with regret, vowing to make up for it. Does not the late Premier, on the verge of death, repeatedly and earnestly exhort us to abolish unequal treaties as his legacy? His sincerity is enough to move gods and open metal and stone. Our association and others either engage in shipping as merchants or rely on navigation as their sole means of livelihood. We earnestly hope that the late Premier's legacy will be realized. How so? If these unequal treaties are not fundamentally abolished for one day, and coastal navigation rights are not actually recovered for one day, then our country's shipping industry will have no reason to develop for one day, and our association and others will be in deep despair for one day. Although our association and others consider themselves insignificant, we can say that we have thought deeply and planned carefully about this issue of our own survival and extinction. What we cannot do is that the merchant ships of various countries have penetrated deep into our hinterland and are flooding the coast. It is as if they have seized our throat and poisoned our brains. Even if we want to rise up and fight, we cannot. Fortunately, the Japanese treaty has expired, which is the only opportunity to correct the humiliation and loss of rights. Therefore, our association and others do not hesitate to appeal to our government to take care of the remaining vitality of the shipping industry, and strive to actually recover coastal navigation rights when signing the commercial treaty this time, so that shipping merchants will not go bankrupt and sailors will not lose their jobs. We have not yet received a clear indication. Upon reading the full text of the Sino-Japanese Customs Agreement signed on the 6th of this month, although the navigation treaty has not been agreed upon, the second article states that "the treatment given to the government or its people of that country in respect of ship taxes and all matters related to the above, shall not be less favorable than the treatment now or in the future given to its own people or any other foreign government and its people. Also, ships of China or Japan shall, within the territory of the other country, receive treatment in respect of ship taxes and all matters relating to ship taxes not less favorable than that now or in the future received by ships of any other country." This is tantamount to implicitly permitting Japanese ships to continue to have the right to sail and carry goods in our country's coastal and inland waters in the future. The efforts of the people to abolish the unequal treaties are still as they were. Then what hope do our associations have? Although this does not include specific provisions for navigation, since there is a provision that is no less favorable than any other country now or in the future, then the existing treaties of various countries have not yet expired. Even if the treaty expires in the future, if any other country has an excuse not to abandon the navigation rights it has plundered, then we cannot treat Japan differently. With each other interacting in turn, is it not possible that navigation rights will never be recovered? However, our associations deeply hope that this view is inaccurate. Therefore, we venture to present this request to our wise diplomatic authorities, and clearly announce the policy for the future navigation treaty and the practical steps for recovering navigation rights. As the saying goes, "If you are prepared, you will have no worries." Since shipping is related to the circulation of goods, if navigation rights are recovered, and Japan cancels its ships in our coastal and Yangtze River waters, it will inevitably lead to fewer ships and more goods, and the stagnation of goods. How should our country increase ships, or how should we buy their ships and docks, etc.? There should be prior planning for everything, so that there will be no panic when the time comes. This really depends on the strategy and regulations of our government, and then merchants can easily arrange things. The opportunity is pressing, so why does the government still have no indication? Does the department only seek equality in the text of the treaty, and the mutual inland navigation is not mutually beneficial, and the responsibility for competition rests with the merchants? If so, then our associations dare to solemnly tell the diplomatic authorities who inherit the spirit of the late Premier's uncompromising spirit, that this is another suicidal treaty! The rate of progress of material civilization is like a parabola, accelerating downwards. Therefore, Japan can complete the restoration of the entire city of Tokyo in six and a half years, while our country may not be able to build a road in three years. There is no other reason, but industry, commerce, economy, science, and talent are all lagging behind. In fact, it is like this, but we still want to comfort ourselves with equality and reciprocity in the text. Is it reciprocity? Or is it unique? It is not up to the wise to decide. Try to be more practical. Japanese ships are said to be 5 million tons, while our country is less than 300,000 tons. The age of Japanese ships is mostly under 20 years, while our country's are over 30 years. One in a hundred of our ships go to Japan. Japanese ships import more than ours. In fact, it is like this, even if we want to comfort ourselves, can we? Therefore, if our diplomatic authorities conclude a treaty with Japan this time, if they do not observe the true situation of our country's shipping industry, and do not actually cancel Japan's right to navigate and carry goods in our coastal and inland waters, and only seek the splendor of the surface, it is the government's intention to abandon our sailors. Then our associations will have no choice but to stop working, stop shipping, and die in the East China Sea. How can we bear to still be trampled on and slaughtered under the clear sky and white sun? Everyone loves life, who is not like me? It is also shameful to live shamefully. Forced to this point, we make this cry of sorrow, and we only hope that our government will appreciate our foolish sincerity, forgive our excitement, and quickly announce the negotiating policy and the practical steps for recovering navigation rights, so as to comfort our expectations and facilitate preparations. The country is fortunate, and our associations are very fortunate.</p>
<h3>Japanese Invasion of Navigation Rights</h3>
<p>Preventing Chinese Ships from Going to Japan from Dalian</p>
<p>Shanghai Shipping Association Submits a Request to the Ministry to Argue</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association submitted a document to the Ministry of Communications yesterday, stating, "We are reporting the details of the Chinese ships in Dalian that did not load goods and went to Japan, and we ask for your review and implementation. According to the Ministry's Order No. 1616, it was stated that the Dalian Japanese Maritime Bureau prevented Chinese ships from loading goods to Japan in Dalian. The association previously sent a telegram on behalf of the company and has already telegraphed the Dalian Customs to earnestly negotiate and approve the record. Now, according to the Dalian Customs Commissioner, the Chinese ships left for Japan on May 10 without loading goods. The details have been informed to the Shanghai Shipping Association by Zhengji Company and forwarded to the Ministry, etc., according to this situation, it is appropriate to order to inform and report the details, etc., according to this order, the association previously received a report from member Zhengji Company, and received a telegram from Dalian, the Chinese ships of the Yingkou Overseas Trade Company, which represents the company, planned to load the goods scheduled to go to Japan in Dalian, but were suddenly stopped by the Dalian Japanese Maritime Bureau. Please report the matter to the association by telegram for negotiation, etc., according to the situation, the Ministry was informed by telegram, and the Dalian Customs was telegraphed to earnestly negotiate, etc., according to the record, Zhengji Company then sent a letter saying that the Chinese ships were prevented from loading goods in Dalian by the Japanese Maritime Bureau. Now, a letter from Dalian says, "The ship is scheduled to load a full ship of coal to Japan. The contract states that it will first be loaded in Yingkou to the extent that it can sail out (calculated to be 4,500 tons of coal loaded in Yingkou), and the remaining empty space will be added in Dalian (there is still 4,000 tons of empty space). According to the investigation, our ship used to load goods from Dalian to Japan, which is a normal thing, and there has never been any hindrance. Up to now, many Western ships have also transported goods from Dalian to Japan, and there has never been any hindrance. Unexpectedly, this time, the Chinese ships were actually prohibited from loading and transporting by the Dalian Maritime Bureau. According to the director of the bureau, Dalian is a Japanese port and foreign ships are not allowed to load goods to Japan, etc. However, foreign ships are not prohibited, and only our Chinese ships are discriminated against. After repeated negotiations, they were not allowed to accommodate. In this situation, if we wait for a long time, the loss will be huge. We were forced to abandon the 4,000 tons of empty space and sail to Yokohama. This move is not small for the loss of a Chinese ship and the future shipping relations of Chinese ships. Please ask the association to urge the department to seriously negotiate to maintain navigation rights, etc." According to the association's investigation, Dalian is our country's territory, and Japan is a friendly country. There is no precedent for prohibiting merchant ships from transporting goods. Now, the Japanese Maritime Bureau in the port suddenly prevented our country's merchant ships from transporting goods from Dalian to Japan, which is not only wantonly destroying our country's shipping industry, but is actually intentionally infringing on our country's sovereignty. The matter is of great importance and cannot be tolerated. We urge the department to consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to seriously negotiate to prevent aggression and protect sovereignty. We cannot wait."</p>

<h3>President Tan</h3>
<p>Urging Foreign Minister Wang to Return to Beijing After His Leave</p>
<p>Handwritten Letter Entrusted to Fan Guang to Deliver to Shanghai</p>
<p>After Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting came to Shanghai the other day, he took a leave of absence from the Executive Yuan for two weeks due to physical discomfort and recuperation at his Shanghai residence on Gubalu Road. He entrusted Counselor Fan Guang of the ministry to carry the documents to Beijing. After President Tan received the report, he believed that the ministry's affairs were busy and depended on him to preside over them, so he approved a leave of absence for one week and wrote a handwritten letter urging him to return to Beijing after his leave, entrusting Counselor Fan to deliver it to Shanghai. Mr. Fan came to Shanghai by car the night before and went to Mr. Wang's residence immediately after arriving at the North Station yesterday morning.

<h3>Yunnan Customs Changes Tax Collection Method</h3>
<p>Yunnan Chamber of Commerce Cables Shanghai to Ask the Central Government to Postpone Implementation</p>
<p>Yunnan's finances are chaotic, and paper money is rampant. Each yuan of paper money is only worth 30% of the common silver dollar, but customs duties can be fully paid in paper money. It is now heard that Yunnan Province Customs has been ordered to increase cash collection, or to pay the actual price in paper money. Yunnan merchants and people have already had weak purchasing power and poor business due to chaotic finances. Now, the burden has suddenly increased, and it is impossible to pay for a while. A few days ago, the General Chamber of Commerce of Yunnan Province and other groups sent a telegram to the Yunnan Fellow Association in Shanghai, requesting the Central Government to temporarily postpone the implementation and temporarily stop redeeming goods. The telegram and the association's reply are recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram from Yunnan Chamber of Commerce and various groups to Mr. Zhang Rongxi and other gentlemen of the Yunnan Fellow Association in Fanwang Palace: "The Yunnan Customs has increased the water content by 10 times, and the postage stamps have increased by 5 times. The Central Government originally decided to increase the collection after Yunnan's finances were restored. We have repeatedly telegraphed the Central Government to ask for consideration of the increasing chaos in Yunnan's finances and postpone the implementation, but we have not received a reply. The Customs authorities insist on implementation, resulting in imports and exports being suspended due to waiting for the reply. We urge you to ask the Central Government to immediately telegraph the Customs authorities to temporarily postpone the implementation to alleviate the people's difficulties and maintain the merchants' difficulties. We look forward to your reply. The Yunnan General Chamber of Commerce and various groups kowtow." The Yunnan Fellow Association in Shanghai replied to the Yunnan General Chamber of Commerce and various groups: "We have received your telegram and will follow your instructions to strive for the support of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Ministry of Industry. We hope that you will telegraph the Central Government again and ask the provincial government to strive for support. The Yunnan Fellow Association in Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Ministry Approves Changes to Crackdown on Superstitious Objects</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Foil Industry Association received a document from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, No. 61, stating, "The Shanghai Special Foil Industry Association, represented by Chen Yongnian, the standing committee member, submitted a document on the method of cracking down on businesses dealing with superstitious objects. The tin foil industry is of great importance to the people's livelihood and public security. Before a large-scale factory is planned, please postpone the crackdown." We have received your telegram. This case was previously approved by the Executive Yuan Secretariat and forwarded by the Zhejiang Provincial Government for discussion and was combined for review. It is now approved by the Executive Yuan's order from the National Government to change the handling. You are hereby informed. The association has informed the industry to check and follow."</p>
<h3>Supervision by the Municipal Supervisory Committee</h3>
<p>Handling of Compensation for the May 30th Massacre</p>
<p>Letter Received from the Central Secretariat Yesterday</p>
<p>City Government to Collect and Forward</p>
<p>The issue of compensation for the families of those who died in the May 30th Massacre has been negotiated many times. The Public Concession eventually agreed to pay 150,000 yuan in compensation to be distributed to the families of the victims. However, the representatives of the May 30th Massacre Family Association, such as Hu Changsheng, did not follow proper procedures when distributing the compensation, resulting in the fraudulent receipt of compensation. As a result, Luo Chenshi and Luo Wenlin and others filed a lawsuit in court against Hu Changsheng and others, and Hu Changsheng sued Wang Zhaohua and others for embezzling compensation. The Standing Committee of the Central Party Headquarters was concerned about the dispute caused by this case and instructed the Municipal Party Supervisory Committee to supervise and handle it quickly. The original letter stated, "Recently, the Standing Committee issued a statement that the 150,000 yuan in compensation from the British Public Works Bureau for the May 30th Massacre should be collected and forwarded to the families of the deceased by the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, and the Municipal Supervisory Committee should be instructed to supervise the distribution and report it." After receiving the letter, the association resolved at the Fifth Standing Committee meeting yesterday (22nd) to appoint Comrade Zhu Yingpeng to handle the matter jointly with the municipal government.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>Promoting Domestic Goods with New Initiatives</p>
<p>Organizing Basic Production and Sales Cooperatives for Domestic Goods</p>
<p>Since the sharp decline in silver prices, the national economy has experienced extreme panic. Frugality to save the crisis has become the center of public opinion at the moment. Promoting domestic goods is the first priority in the cry for frugality. The Shanghai Municipal Council had a resolution to promote domestic goods by organizing basic family groups, which was handed over to the Social Affairs Bureau to formulate specific measures and report to the council for discussion. It is now heard that the Social Affairs Bureau has drafted a charter for the Basic Production and Sales Cooperatives for Domestic Goods, consisting of 20 articles, and submitted it to the municipal government for review and implementation. Because the charter is closely related to the future of the industry, it is specifically scheduled to be discussed in detail at 2:00 pm on the 29th of this month in the bureau to solicit public opinions for reference by the municipal government during the review. The original text of the document submitted by the Social Affairs Bureau to the municipal government and the draft charter are recorded below for those who are concerned about the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Submits Document to the Municipal Government for Reporting</h3>
<p>According to the Ministry's Order No. 3639, "It is hereby ordered that the proposal to promote domestic goods by organizing basic family groups has been resolved at the 151st Municipal Council meeting. "The Social Affairs Bureau shall formulate specific measures and report to the council for discussion, etc." The Social Affairs Bureau shall comply with this order immediately. I believe that it is difficult to develop based solely on the unity of consumers without considerable connection with the production side. Therefore, the basic family group is proposed as a group of consumers (referred to as Class A members), and domestic goods factories or sellers are a group of production suppliers (referred to as Class B members). There are two groups that are connected to each other, so it is difficult to name the charter. It is named the Basic Production and Sales Cooperative for Domestic Goods, which is still not satisfactory. The mutually beneficial relationship between the two groups is detailed in the section on the rights and obligations of Class A and Class B members of the charter. I believe that our country is a country with backward industry and commerce, and it is also a country that is most severely affected by foreign economic aggression. The power of foreign goods is overwhelming, and the people are accustomed to using them without discernment, which is not easy to correct. Moreover, domestic goods are not manufactured as well and are not sold as cheaply. Years of promotion have not been very effective. This is partly the reason. In order to encourage those who use domestic goods to participate enthusiastically, it seems appropriate to have considerable encouragement to arouse them. Therefore, it is stipulated that the products of Class B members must be purchased by Class A members, and they also have the right to enjoy special discounts. Class B members have this large group of customers and are supported by the government, such as free proof, free advertising, tax exemption inspection fee reduction, etc., so it should be reasonable for them to be happy to join the association. As for the progress of the association's affairs, it is planned to entrust the Domestic Goods Exhibition Hall under the jurisdiction of the bureau to preside over it to save expenses. The association's income will be used to develop the association's affairs. Due to the previous orders, we have drafted a draft charter for the Basic Production and Sales Cooperative for Domestic Goods, consisting of 20 articles, and respectfully submit it to your Excellency for review and guidance. It is for the public good."</p>

<h3>Tax Exemption for National Goods Advertisements</h3>
<p>The Provisional Measures Drafted by the Three Bureaus of Finance, Social Affairs, and Public Utilities Have Been Approved by the Municipal Government and Ordered to Be Implemented Immediately. The three bureaus of finance, social affairs, and public utilities of this municipality, regarding the tax exemption for national goods advertisements, previously resolved two measures at the 153rd Municipal Affairs Meeting: (A) Those who post advertisements on public advertisement sites built by the Municipal Government shall only pay rent, and the national goods advertisement tax shall be completely exempted; (B) The goods sold in the advertisement shall first submit certification documents from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce or the former Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce to the Social Affairs Bureau for inspection to confirm that they are indeed national goods before the above measures can be applied. The advertising management rules of this municipality should be reviewed and revised accordingly. However, before the revision, in order to facilitate implementation, several provisional measures have been specially drafted for compliance. If there are no obstacles during implementation in the future, the rules will be revised in accordance with these measures. It is reported that the provisional measures were approved by the Municipal Government yesterday and ordered to be implemented immediately. The articles are excerpted as follows: (1) Advertisements displaying the name and image of legitimate national goods, or the name of merchants solely manufacturing and selling legitimate national goods, shall be exempt from advertising tax; (2) Advertisements for legitimate national goods must first submit certification documents from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce or the former Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to the Advertising Management Office of the Public Utilities Bureau for inspection to confirm that they are legitimate national goods before they can be exempted from tax; (3) A handling fee shall be charged for all legitimate national goods advertisements to subsidize expenses such as surveying, registration, stamping, and licensing. The amount shall be calculated at 20% of the tax rate for each type of advertisement as stipulated in the original Shanghai Municipal Advertising Management Rules, except for paper advertisements, which are subject to the original regulations; (4) Advertisements for national goods luxury goods and entertainment items shall be calculated at 80% of the original tax rate stipulated in the Shanghai Municipal Advertising Management Rules; (5) Temporary advertisements (i.e., paper advertisements) shall be charged a handling fee in accordance with the original regulations, and rent for public advertisement sites shall also be charged, with the amount calculated at 40% of the tax rate stipulated in the Shanghai Municipal Advertising Management Rules; (6) The procedures for posting tax-exempt advertisements shall still be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Shanghai Municipal Advertising Management Rules.</p>
<h3>Order Issued by the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>Regulations for the Management of Prepared Medicines</p>
<p>Separate Orders to the Three Bureaus of Public Safety, Health, and Social Affairs for Compliance The Municipal Government yesterday approved a consultation from the Ministry of Health, stating that prepared medicines are products that can be freely purchased and taken by the public without the instructions of a physician for the purpose of treating diseases. If the preparation is improper, the drawbacks are quite worrying. Moreover, there are a few unscrupulous merchants who only know how to profit and disregard the interests of others. The various prepared medicines they sell are either imported from abroad or deliberately fabricated, relying on false and exaggerated advertisements as a tool to promote sales, claiming that one medicine can cure hundreds of diseases, enticing people to buy and take them. Patients, greedy for convenience, lightly try them. Not only are the effects completely absent, but they are also sufficient to delay their treatment period. In the past, the government had no specific regulations for the management of these prepared medicines, nor any legal chemical testing. Therefore, whether the preparation method is appropriate, whether the raw materials are excellent, and whether the advertisements and leaflets have the disadvantages of exaggeration are all impossible to assess, which is not a serious way to treat people's lives. The Ministry, in view of this, has already drafted a draft of regulations for the management of prepared medicines and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval. In addition to separate consultations, a copy of the regulations for the management of prepared medicines is attached, hoping that they will be reviewed and ordered to be followed by the subordinate units. It is reported that the Municipal Government has instructed the three bureaus of public safety, health, and social affairs to follow the regulations accordingly.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau</h3>
<p>Research on Raw Silk Grading Standards</p>
<p>Organize the Raw Silk Grading Committee</p>
<p>The Raw Silk Inspection Department of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau believes that the work of the department is not only limited to inspection but also to the research of raw silk quality so that the raw silk exported can be gradually improved and foreign trade developed. Therefore, it has specially formulated research work to be carried out step by step, and the plan is of particular importance. Because there is no unified grading standard for Chinese silk, and there are no regulations for each grade, the silk firms in Shanghai have to list the silk brands of various factories into several grades for the convenience of trade. However, this grading has no standard, and the manufacturers do not know which grade their products can be classified into. The brands at the top level are not necessarily perfect, and those at the lower level are not necessarily inferior. Medium-sized manufacturers know that their brands are not well-known, and even if they have good products, it is difficult to get a good price. The quality of goods is ignored. On the contrary, if Chinese raw silk has unified grades and each grade has a specified standard, American silk factories can choose a grade according to their needs, sign a contract to purchase, and manufacturers can produce according to their abilities. If they can improve the quality of goods, they can get a higher price. Therefore, in order to improve the quality of raw silk and facilitate foreign trade, it is urgent to stipulate raw silk grading standards. Now, in addition to hiring experts to be responsible for the work, the department has also sent letters to the Shanghai Silk Merchants Association and the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Silk Cocoon General Office to recommend personnel to jointly organize the Raw Silk Grading Committee to solve the grading problem. The procedure is: (1) Collect Chinese factory silk from the aspects of uniformity, cleanliness, cleanness, evenness, tensile strength, and other quality aspects to engage in testing. Send the test results to the Raw Silk Grading Committee for discussion, and the committee will formulate the grades and standards for each grade; (2) After the grade standards are formulated, the committee will report to the representative agencies for approval and submit them to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for record; (3) After the record is made, the selected grades and standards should be adopted as the Chinese raw silk grading standards in conjunction with the silk industry groups.</p>

<h3>Instructions on Investigating and Resolving Backlog Cases</h3>
<p>Yuan Liang's Order to All Districts</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Public Security Bureau instructed all districts to: for the matter of issuing a notice, the First Division presented a list of kidnapping cases in each district, which has been read. The responsibility of the police is to maintain public security and protect the lives and property of the people. This city is a mixed place with waterways in all directions, and it is adjacent to the concession, which is a hiding place for criminals. Therefore, major kidnapping cases occur from time to time. The residents of the whole territory are uneasy day and night, and they rely on strict arrests to ensure that all cases are solved and all criminals are punished, so that the law can establish its authority and the bandits can know to retreat. Since the director took office, he has been working hard on the arrest of criminals, and he has been sparing no effort. Whenever there is a major case solved, he has not been stingy with heavy rewards of thousands of gold and promotions beyond the grade. All requests from each district to add police and weapons, to the extent possible, are all approved immediately. In addition, detectives are assigned to facilitate command and given detective fees to facilitate activities. The salaries and allowances of the detectives are also increased, and they are given considerable power without any conditions. The intention is to encourage colleagues to be loyal and strive to achieve the goal of cleaning up the whole territory and making a pre-emptive move to recover the concession. Previously, due to the large number of backlog cases, repeated orders were issued to clear them up and resolve them within a time limit. After reviewing the list in detail, from February 27 to the 6th of this month, there are still more than 30 unsolved cases. The number of backlog cases in each district is as high as six, and as few as two, three, or four. It seems that such arbitrary delays are really unacceptable. The director of this bureau is in charge of the important task of introspection, and he cannot sleep well and eat well. The captains of the districts are responsible for their respective districts, but they are sitting idly by and allowing the stacking of cases, the swallowing of boats, the escape of criminals, and the looting of goods, and the victims are suing without a door. The salaries you receive are the people's wealth, and you do not feel guilty in the clear night. For this reason, a copy of the list is sent to all districts. The captains of each district should immediately check the cases in their respective districts on the list, urge their subordinates to strengthen the investigation and arrest within a time limit, and make sure to capture the real culprits and bring them to justice to quell the banditry and appease the people. The district chiefs should also be fully responsible for the cases in their respective districts and supervise the police officers and detectives to investigate and arrest them according to the severity of the cases, offer rewards to purchase information, divide the work and cooperate closely, and conduct strict investigation. The district officers, patrol officers, chiefs, and police officers have their own responsibilities and cannot shirk them. All detectives are especially responsible for their duties. Within one month, the district chiefs should find out the details of each case in their respective districts listed in the list, as well as kidnapping incidents that occur later, and report them with details of the investigation process, indicating whether they have been solved or not. For the officers and policemen under their jurisdiction, they should also find out the arrest achievements, fill out the facts and comments separately, and choose the best to recommend and impeach. The director of this bureau will personally review them and give severe punishments and rewards to show the intention of eliminating violence and appeasing the people and comprehensively reviewing the facts. Be careful. This order is attached with the list of kidnapping cases in each district presented by the First Division. May 17, 1930, Director Yuan Liang.</p>

<h3>Public Concession Tram Workers</h3>
<p>Welcoming Fellow Workers Released from Prison</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 22nd) at 10:00 AM, all the tram workers from the new and old factories in the Public Concession, acting on a resolution of the Labor Club, began a slowdown. At 10:30 AM, over eighty trams simultaneously gathered at locations like the Hongqiao and Lunjiji Bridge, moving at a walking pace, almost coming to a complete standstill. The ticket selling was also very slow. On the other hand, several dozen workers were sent to the Special District Court to welcome the arrested fellow workers upon their release from prison. At around 1:00 PM, representatives hired two cars to first transport the released workers to the old factory on Hart Road, to receive the welcome of the workers there. Upon arriving at the factory gate, firecrackers were set off for about half an hour. All the coppersmiths stopped working, and over a hundred workers waiting for shifts to start and those selling tickets crowded around the eight released workers, who were ushered into the factory for a meeting. Both sides delivered enthusiastic speeches. Outside the factory, as many as two thousand onlookers showed extreme excitement, applauding to express their welcome. They then boarded the original cars and proceeded to the Huishan Beikaier West Factory, where they received the same expressions of welcome. All the workers from the new and old factories decided to hold a welcoming rally tomorrow (today) at 6:00 PM at the open ground on Dalian Bay Road, while supporting their return to work. The Labor Club will also invite various organizations to participate, which is sure to generate an even more enthusiastic display.</p>
<h3>Tram Company</h3>
<p>Requesting Probation for Workers</p>
<p>Sincere Cooperation with Workers</p>
<p>On the 14th of this month, at 11:00 AM, when the tram workers' strike had not been resolved, a tram on a certain route, traveling from Yangjingbang to Jing'an Temple, was stopped at the intersection of Avenue Edouard VII and Hart Road by dozens of striking coppersmiths. They damaged the machinery and beat the ticket seller and driver. The driver, Li San'shan, was injured. The police arrested eight people, including Qi Heshang, and sent them to the Special District Local Court for investigation and trial. Now that the labor dispute has been peacefully resolved, the company, hoping that labor and management can sincerely cooperate from now on, also advocates a peaceful resolution for the detained workers. Therefore, when Judge Sun Yuan of the Special District Local Court tried the case yesterday morning, the company sent a Western employee, Mr. Mill, to the court. After Li San'shan and others testified that the defendants had committed violence, he translated that if the judge found the defendants guilty and had to punish them according to the law, he requested leniency and probation. The police lawyer, Bo Liang, also agreed to the Western employee's request. Without defense from the defendants' lawyer, Fan Gang, Judge Sun announced the verdict: Qi Heshang was fined fifty yuan for the crime of obstructing rights and forty yuan for the crime of damage, with the total amount set at sixty yuan. If he could not pay, he would be imprisoned for thirty days. Xu Jinfu, Xu Chunrong, Lin Xingji, Lin Chengshao, Zhang Fushun, Qi Jinsheng, and Zhang Zhikui were each fined forty yuan for the crime of jointly obstructing rights and thirty yuan for the crime of jointly damaging property, with the total amount set at fifty yuan each. The number of days of detention before the judgment was confirmed would be deducted. After the judgment, it was announced that the seven defendants from Xu Jinfu onwards were granted probation for two years.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Assassination Case</h3>
<p>Liu Zanchen, a Moneylender,</p>
<p>Shot Dead in the Toilet</p>
<p>Four Suspects Arrested</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 1:00 AM, a man was shot dead in a toilet pit on Jinling Road, Huakang Road, Zhabei. Because the location was remote and the time was late at night, no one knew about it. It was not until 6:40 AM that the patrol leader of the Taiyangmiao Police Station of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau discovered it during a patrol. Afterwards, the deceased was identified as Liu Zanchen. The case is very complex, but the main reasons are nothing more than adultery, rivalry, and revenge. Four suspects have now been arrested. The full details are as follows:</p>
<p>A Lecherous Woman: Li Lu'shi, a woman from Yancheng, is forty-six years old and rather plain in appearance. She has always been lecherous. Her late husband, Zhang, passed away almost twenty years ago. Before a month had passed, Lu'shi became acquainted with Zheng Decai, a Funing native who lives at No. 18 Deshunli, Changan Road, and runs a small business (Zheng is also known as Xiao Dezi, fifty-three years old). At first, they were very close and had three sons: the eldest, Shiyi, is thirteen years old; the second, Xiao Erzi, is ten years old; and the youngest, Xiao Sanzi, is also ten years old. However, Li Lu'shi's wild nature was difficult to tame. Over time, her relationship with Zheng gradually faded, eventually abandoning Zheng and forming an inextricable bond with Liu Zanchen.</p>
<p>Cohabiting for Six Years: Liu Zanchen, a native of Beiping, forty-seven years old, resides at No. 96 Jinling Road, Huakang Road, making a living by lending money at high interest rates and is financially well-off. Lu'shi is quite content in his home. Time flies, and it has been six years since they met. Liu pampers her, but he views her former lover, Zheng Decai, as a jealous enemy, and Zheng is filled with hatred, with no opportunity to vent it.</p>
<p>The Reason for Suspicion: Liu has three fellow Yancheng natives living with him: Zhou Shuming, thirty-four years old; Zhou Jihe, thirty-two years old; and Zhou Qicai, thirty years old. They usually get along harmoniously. Qicai's wife, Zhang, is in the prime of her life and has some beauty. The couple is inseparable. Unexpectedly, Qicai suddenly committed a theft last month and was sentenced to five years of forced labor. Zhang, with her husband in prison and struggling to make a living, often relies on Liu for support, leading to jealousy from his peers. They discussed with Zheng, wanting to get rid of Liu to their satisfaction.</p>
<p>Never to Return: The previous night, after Liu Zanchen collected the high-interest money, he gathered with his beloved wife to drink and celebrate. Zhou Shuming and Zhou Jihe, brothers, came to visit. Liu then socialized with them, and the room was filled with joy. Later, when they ran out of cigarettes, Liu went out to buy them, and Zhou and others also followed him out. Who knew that Liu would never return? Li Lu'shi waited for a long time and did not see Liu return. Feeling exhausted, she went to bed first. Little did she know that a tragic scene was about to unfold. A Glimpse of the Gruesome Corpse: Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, Guo Zhenqi, the patrol leader of the Taiyangmiao Police Station of the Fourth District Headquarters in Zhabei, led a patrol to the toilet at the intersection of Jinling Road and Huakang Road and discovered the body of a man shot dead. The bullet entered from the back right side of his head and exited from the front left temple. The man was tall and strong, wearing a black cloth jacket and trousers, yellow leather shoes, and black socks. Beside him was a waterproof oilcloth umbrella. He was lying on the ground, with blood flowing everywhere, a very gruesome sight. He immediately reported back to the headquarters.</p>
<p>Adultery and Murder: Jin, the head of the Fourth District Headquarters, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered the police chief to cooperate with detectives to investigate and arrest the suspects. They learned that the deceased was named Liu Zanchen and brought Liu's lover, Li Lu'shi, to the station to inquire about the situation. Zheng and others were highly suspected. Zheng Decai, Zhou Shuming, and Zhou Jihe were arrested one after another and interrogated strictly, but all denied the crime. Li Lu'shi swore that Zheng and others committed the murder out of jealousy and adultery. The case was to be investigated and resolved. The body was reported to the Special District Local Court by the local headman at 2:00 PM yesterday. A prosecutor was appointed to conduct an autopsy, confirming that the death was caused by a gunshot wound. The family was instructed to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>Deputy Comprador of Banque de l'Indochine</h3>
<p>Flees with a Huge Sum of Money</p>
<p>Carrying Away 150,000 Taels of Silver</p>
<p>Sends a Letter Promising to Raise Enough Funds for Repayment</p>
<p>Zhu Jixing, a Ningbo native who was the deputy comprador of the Banque de l'Indochine at No. 26, the Bund, Beijing Road, suddenly fled with 150,000 taels of silver the day before yesterday without saying goodbye. By yesterday, Ling, the head comprador of the Banque de l'Indochine, inspected the silver and found a shortage of 150,000 taels of Jiuba standard silver, which greatly surprised him. The deputy comprador, Zhu Jixing, had not arrived at the bank to work by noon. Ling was quite suspicious, so he telephoned Zhu's residence. According to his family, he had not returned home the previous night. The Banque de l'Indochine then went to Zhu's residence at No. 1 Ruihuali to search, but he was long gone. In the afternoon, the bank received a letter in Zhu's own handwriting, stating that although he had taken the money, it was due to temporary financial difficulties and he had no choice. He would return it as soon as he had raised enough funds. It is now reported that the bank, because Zhu had taken such a large sum of money, reported the case to the General Inspectorate of Police for investigation and arrest at 7:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<h3>Pirates Break into Songkou</h3>
<p>Plundering a Fresh Fish Boat</p>
<p>The Ningbo fishing boat Jin Shunli, loaded with fresh yellow croaker of Xie Alai's fresh fish business from Ningbo, arrived in Wusong the day before yesterday (the 19th) and was docked at the Pudong beach opposite the Jianghai Customs House. Xie immediately went ashore to report to the Jellyfish Guild for assistance in selling the fresh fish. However, due to price issues, they were unable to open the hold and sell the goods. He then went to Shanghai to inquire about market prices. When he returned to Song the next morning to sell the goods, the fresh fish boat was gone. Xie suspected that the boat owner, Jin Shunli, had taken the boat to Shanghai to sell the goods, so he rushed to Shanghai to investigate, but to no avail. In great distress, he returned to Song to inquire. According to boatmen docked there, at around 1:00 AM the previous night, they saw more than a dozen people in a small boat row to the fresh fish boat, then raise the sail and head out to sea. However, it was unknown whether these people were pirates or not. Xie now realized that the pirates were extremely bold and dared to break into Songkou and plunder the fishing boat. Yesterday, the Jellyfish Guild submitted a report to the Fourth District Water Police Department, requesting that a warship be dispatched to pursue and rescue the fresh fish boat and the boat owner Jin Shunli and all eight or nine crew members. According to reports, where the fresh fish boat was docked, dozens of merchant ships often docked overnight. Furthermore, the Shui Jing Junhe, Ce Dian, and Pingyang warships had also been docked there in recent days. Across the street, there was also the Fourth Detachment of the Water Patrol. The pirates seemed to disregard all of this, which can be described as extremely rampant. It is said that three fresh fishing boats sailed out at the same time that night. Other than the Jin Shunli, which has been confirmed, the other two boats cannot be confirmed, and it is possible that they were also pirate ships.</p>
<h3>Court Continues Hearing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Six Hundred Thousand Yuan Fraud Case</p>
<p>Still Three to Four Hundred Spectators</p>
<p>Besides Lending at High Interest Rates,</p>
<p>The Remaining Sum Was Used for Deposit Interest</p>
<p>He Qiqing Granted Bail to Manage Affairs</p>
<p>Yang Shulin, formerly the patrol chief of the Fourth District of Zhabei, a native of Tianjin, established Wenji Hexing and other companies to specialize in lending money at high interest rates and attracting deposits from all walks of life with high interest rates. Many who coveted ill-gotten gains fell into his trap. Over four or five years, Yang obtained more than 630,000 yuan. To strengthen the depositors' faith, he falsely claimed to start industries and established several shops. By the spring, Yang's fraudulent methods were exposed, and he fled to Tianjin. The depositors sent people to accompany him back to Shanghai and ordered him to settle the accounts. Because Yang wanted to escape again, he was reported to the police, and Yang and his messenger He Qiqing were arrested and sent to the Special District Local Court for interrogation and detention. These events have been reported repeatedly in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the continued hearing of this case. The number of male and female depositors attending the hearing was still three to four hundred. At around 3:00 PM, Judge Sun ascended the bench and interrogated the managers or accountants of Yang's Prida Steel Factory, Hexing Gold Shop, and Wenji Beekeeping Company, one by one, asking about the capital, business conditions, and profits and losses of each shop. He then interrogated the defendant Yang Shulin about what he had done with the huge sum of money. According to Yang, there were still 100,100 yuan of high-interest loans issued by Wenji and 40,000 yuan issued by Hexing, as well as more than 20,000 yuan that could be recovered from associations. The rest was used to pay interest to the depositors, and there were accounts to prove it. The court then asked who handled the high-interest loans. Yang replied that they were all issued by the messengers he hired, of which there were twenty-six. He then reported the names of each person one by one. After mutual arguments by the lawyers of both sides, Judge Sun ordered the defendant He Qiqing to post a bail of 1,000 yuan to manage the accounting affairs outside of detention. Yang Shulin was remanded in custody to await sentencing.</p>
<h3>Forged Zhuang Piao</h3>
<p>57,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Cannot Escape the Eyes of the Siming Bank</p>
<p>Blank Checks Found on His Person</p>
<p>The Sugar Shop is Already Empty</p>
<p>Zheng Hekang, a native of Yong, was a debt collector at the Deji Sugar Shop at No. 2, Xiang'anli, Rue du Consulat, in the French Concession. The day before yesterday, he presented a Zhuang Piao from the Yifeng Money Shop at No. 26 Ningo Road, worth 57,000 yuan, and three other Zhuang Piao, worth 1,990 yuan, to the Siming Bank for deposit. The bank staff found that one of the Yifeng Zhuang Piao was doubtful, but the rest were genuine. They immediately ordered a clerk to go to the Yifeng Money Shop to verify the authenticity. According to the staff of the money shop, the Zhuang Piao was forged. The bank then detained Zheng and reported the case to the General Inspectorate of Police. Detective Ma Xiaozhi was ordered to arrest Zheng and bring him back to the police station. Three Siming Bank checks were found in Zheng's pocket: (1) silver 31,416 taels, (2) silver 17,700 taels, (3) 3,000 taels, totaling 52,116 taels. The checks were dated for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of the month. After investigation, Detective Ma found that Zheng was instigated by the owner of the Deji Sugar Shop to deposit the forged Zhuang Piao and withdraw the money with the three checks. He then went to the Deji Sugar Shop with the French Concession police detectives to arrest the accomplices. Unexpectedly, when they arrived at the shop, they found no one inside, and the bedding was rolled up. The account box was also empty. He returned to report to the police chief, who ordered Zheng to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Chief Judge Xu Jiashi and Chief Prosecutor Zhou Xianjue ascended the bench for the trial. The police lawyer, Gan Jingxian, presented the case, stating that the defendant was accused of fraud under Article 363 of the Criminal Law and requested prosecution. He then presented the forged Zhuang Piao as evidence. Detective Ma and the representatives of the Yifeng Money Shop, Shi Huiting, and the Siming Bank, Tong Xueyin, successively submitted all the details. When questioned, the defendant confessed that he was instructed by his master, Zhu, and did not know that the Zhuang Piao was forged. After Judge Xu verified the confession, he ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Goods Ordered and Goods Not Ordered</h3>
<p>Sandalwood Prices Differ</p>
<p>The Difference in Price Between</p>
<p>Ordered Goods and Non-Ordered Goods is Four Taels</p>
<p>The Point of Contention is Whether It Was a One-Time Purchase</p>
<p>In June of the previous year, Chen Maotang ordered 30 tons of sandalwood from the Sino-Australian Trading Company at No. 24 Sijing Road. Not long after, the goods arrived, totaling 47 tons and 13.5 dans. Chen purchased them all and made a considerable profit after selling them. The company then claimed that Chen had only ordered 30 tons, which should be calculated at the agreed price of 16 taels and 5 qian. The remaining 17 tons and 13.5 dans should be calculated at the market price of 20 taels and 5 qian. Therefore, they demanded that Chen return 1,612 taels of silver. Chen argued that although he had said he would order 30 tons, he had immediately agreed to the company's request to purchase all 47 tons and settled the account in one transaction. How could it be divided into two matters? Therefore, he sternly refused the company's request to return the money. The Sino-Australian Company then, in the name of a British merchant, hired a lawyer to sue Chen in the former Provisional Court for not paying the money. At that time, the court had not yet been reorganized, and foreign consuls could sit on the bench for cases involving Chinese and foreigners. Unexpectedly, the case was not concluded before the Special District Local Court was reorganized, and the consular jury system was abolished. Lawsuits, regardless of Chinese or foreign, were treated equally. Those who relied on foreign merchants as protection lost their effectiveness. The Sino-Australian Trading Company then authorized the comprador, Zhou Rulin, to hire a Chinese lawyer to participate in the lawsuit. The reason was that Zhou and Chen were involved in the transaction and Zhou was aware of all the circumstances. Therefore, he was participating to assist the plaintiff. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Wenyong opened the court for the trial. Only the participant of the plaintiff, the British Sino-Australian Trading Company, was present. The defendant hired lawyer Wang Fushang to defend him. Lawyer Wang first stated the reason why the plaintiff company was now represented by its comprador, saying that it was due to the change in the court system and the fact that consuls could no longer sit on the bench. He then explained the conflict in the case, arguing that the goods were actually purchased in one transaction and that the plaintiff was forcing a division into two batches and needed to provide evidence to prove it. The lawyer of the plaintiff participant then stated that the defendant had only ordered 30 tons and was in partnership with Zhou Weixin. The remaining 17 tons and 13.5 dans, because they arrived at the same time as the 30</p>

<p>The Republic of China, May 23, 1920 (Shen Bao, Fourth Page) Friday (16)</p>
<p>tons, were also sold to the defendant. Since they were not within the ordered quantity, the price should not be the same as the ordered price. Now, the prices of the two batches of goods are combined, and after deducting the money received, 1,612 taels are owed, requesting a judgment for repayment and overdue interest. Judge Xu, because the plaintiff had not arrived in court, ordered a postponement and summons for the Western plaintiff to continue the trial.</p>
<h3>A Fierce Wife Abuses Her Elders</h3>
<p>Xu Longchui Requests a Divorce</p>
<p>Four Witnesses All Testify to Her Ferocity</p>
<p>Xu Longsheng, a farmer from Xijiao, the 30th Bao, 3rd Tu, Xujiazhai Township, complained that his wife, Xu Zhang, was extremely ferocious, even to the point of abusing his elders, which he could no longer tolerate. He recently hired lawyer Chen Wenxiang to file a petition in the Local Court, requesting a divorce. Yesterday morning, Judge Du Xian opened the court for questioning. The plaintiff, Xu Longsheng, testified that he was twenty-five years old, a native of Shanghai, and made a living by farming. He had married the defendant, Zhang, but she was ferocious and quarrelsome, often picking fights and twisting and beating him. His mother tried to intervene and was slapped in the face. Under these circumstances, it was difficult to live together, and he requested that a divorce be granted. The defendant, Xu Zhang, testified that she was twenty-seven years old and had been married for eight years. She had a mother and elder brother at home. The court asked why she beat her husband and mother-in-law. She replied, "I didn't beat him. They were beating me. My sister-in-law from next door came to break it up." The court ordered (1) witness Xu Ziting to testify. He was thirty-five years old. The court ordered the defendant to identify who Xu was. She replied, "He is my uncle." The court asked Xu Ziting why they were in court. He replied, "On March 13th of this year, Longsheng went fishing, and the defendant wouldn't let him, leading to a dispute. I saw the defendant beat the plaintiff. Because the plaintiff is usually afraid of the defendant, the defendant's ferocity has become more and more intense." The court then ordered (2) witness Zhou Fangyu to testify. The defendant identified him as her uncle-in-law. Zhou testified that the defendant had beaten her husband more than once. Because the plaintiff is gentle and timid, he was beaten by the defendant. His aunt tried to intervene and was even beaten. The court also ordered (2) witness Xu Xiaomao to testify. The defendant identified him as her uncle. Xu testified that he and the plaintiff lived in the same house. The couple often quarreled and fought, and the defendant even beat her mother-in-law. The court also ordered (4) witness Chen Deshun to testify, stating that the plaintiff was his nephew and his testimony was the same as above. Xu Zhang, fifty-five years old, testified that the defendant, Xu Zhang, was her daughter-in-law. They were not on good terms. At night, her son tried to sleep in the room, but the daughter-in-law locked the door first, not allowing her son to sleep in the room. She tried to persuade her, but she scolded her and even slapped her. She was really having a hard time. If she didn't beat her, she wouldn't bother the magistrate. Her son was a good man and was used to being bullied by her. Beating and scolding were not uncommon. The court questioned and then questioned the defendant, with the witnesses present all saying she was bad. Had she ever beaten her mother-in-law? She replied, "No." The court then ordered both parties to withdraw and wait for the defendant's mother and elder brother to be summoned to court for further trial.</p>
<h3>A Woman Accuses Her Husband of Abandonment</h3>
<p>An Appeal Causes Problems</p>
<p>The Plaintiff Failed to Appear on Time</p>
<p>The Initial Judgment Was Dismissed</p>
<p>Restoration to the Original State is Impossible</p>
<p>The Court Ordered Further Investigation Before Retrial</p>
<p>Niu Qu, a local woman residing at No. 802 Dahaili, Yuezhou Road, hired lawyer Lu Qi to file a criminal complaint in the Special District Local Court against her husband, Niu Shanqing, for abandonment. The gist of her complaint was that the plaintiff married the defendant in September of the 16th year of the Republic [1927], and they were initially on good terms. However, because the defendant repeatedly asked her to borrow money from her mother's family and was unsuccessful, their relationship deteriorated. The defendant squandered almost all of the plaintiff's dowry. Last spring, the defendant had other plans and left without saying goodbye, leaving the plaintiff's livelihood uncared for and resorting to sinister means. On March 23rd of last year, he went to the defendant's former mother-in-law, Ding Jin, to demand living expenses from the defendant. Unexpectedly, upon meeting, he insulted and scolded the plaintiff. He then agreed to give the plaintiff (hereinafter referred to as "the plaintiff") 30 yuan per month as living expenses, but a contract had to be signed, with no increases in the future. The plaintiff unknowingly agreed, and the defendant wrote two copies of the contract, forcing her to sign. Later, the plaintiff showed the contract to others and realized that it was not a contract for monthly payments but a divorce document. From then on, the defendant never met her again. The plaintiff had no choice but to complain to the Women's Association and hire a lawyer to publish a denial in the newspaper and issue a warning, ordering the return of the forged document within a time limit to avoid litigation. However, the defendant ignored it. Therefore, the plaintiff filed a lawsuit requesting the defendant be punished under Articles 224, 310, and 318 of the Criminal Law. This case was tried twice by the court. During the second hearing, Niu Qu was absent without reason. The presiding judge ruled that the case was dismissed, and the defendant was ordered to return. The plaintiff, dissatisfied with the judgment, filed an appeal. Yesterday afternoon, Song Yuan, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the High Court, Du Fuyao, Ye Zaizhou, and Chief Prosecutor Wang Zhennan held a joint hearing. The appellee, Niu Shanqing, was absent. The appellant's lawyer, Lu Qi, stated the reasons for disagreeing with the initial judgment, saying that when the Special Court held the second hearing on April 23rd, Niu Qu received the summons but, because the word "court" on the summons was unclear, she went to the Fifth Court to wait for the hearing. Unexpectedly, the case was being heard in the Third Court. After the lawyer found her, he accompanied her to the Third Court at 2:20 PM, but the case had already been decided by the judge. The lawyer immediately requested restoration to the original state, but the presiding judge refused and ordered an appeal for remedy. Therefore, the appeal was filed. He then presented the summons as evidence. Judge Song then reviewed the initial trial records and declared that there was no record of the lawyer's request for restoration to the original state in the records. Therefore, it would be better for the lawyer to withdraw the appeal and request the initial court to restore the original state. Lawyer Lu replied that the lawyer had indeed made the request at the time, but whether it was recorded or not was up to the court, and the deadline for requesting restoration to the original state was seven days. If the court's suggestion was followed, the deadline would have passed. What should be done? Judge Song then ordered a postponement for further investigation before retrial.</p>
<h3>Son Goes Mad, Livelihood Cut Off</h3>
<p>Old Woman Attempts Suicide by Drowning</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, an elderly woman over fifty years old boarded a ferry at the Jiangtian Wharf in the Sixteenth Block to cross the river. When the boat reached the middle of the river, the woman suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide. After her body sank, it suddenly floated back up. The ferry crew rescued her and took her to Pudong, where she was handed over to the police, who took her to the Third District Public Security Bureau. She identified herself as Zhang Zhang, fifty-two years old, from Qingjiang, residing at No. 2 Derunli, Shanghai Ning Station. She had a married son and a six-year-old grandson. Her son, Shaoqi, twenty-eight years old, was a driver for the Huashang Tram Company, earning a monthly salary of only twenty yuan, which barely provided for the family. Unfortunately, Shaoqi recently became mentally ill, lost his normalcy, and was unable to work. He is now being treated in a hospital. As a result, the family's livelihood was cut off, and she was starving to death. Therefore, she did not want to linger in the world and would rather drown herself. Having made up her mind, she left home alone at 3:00 PM today while her daughter-in-law was out washing clothes. She originally intended to drown herself in the Suzhou Creek, but because the water was shallow, she feared she would not die. Therefore, she changed her mind and sought death in the Huangpu River. Chief Zhang, upon hearing her statement and seeing her pitiful condition, ordered that relatives be found and notified to claim her.</p>

<p>The Health Campaign Exhibition jointly organized by the Shanghai YMCA and YWCA opened yesterday. The venue was filled with many exhibits.

Women, infants, and members of various groups enthusiastically came to have their physical examinations. The original speaker, Dr. Zhu Hengbi, was unable to attend due to other commitments, so Dr. Xu Naili spoke on infant health issues. The lecture hall was packed, with almost no room to move. The other games were also very meaningful. It is estimated that around three to four thousand people visited yesterday.</p>

<h3>City Government</h3>
<p>Commendation for Mother and Daughter Who Died Saving Aunt</p>
<p>Exemplary Filial Piety of the Zhang Family</p>
<p>Shanghai Special Municipality Branch Security Bureau Chief Yuan Liang, previously reported a case where three members of a household, including a woman named Zhang Wangshi, were burned to death due to negligence at No. 4 Ankang Lane, Second District, Second Precinct. After receiving the phone report from the precinct, he immediately ordered an investigation into the ages, origins, and circumstances of the victims before submitting a report for review. Now, according to the report submitted by Precinct Chief Meng Quansun, Zhang Wangshi and her daughter, Cuifeng, were downstairs when the fire broke out. Because their aunt, Zhang Liushi, was bedridden due to paralysis, the mother and daughter rushed upstairs to rescue her, resulting in the three of them, grandmother, granddaughter, and daughter-in-law, perishing in the flames. Firefighters discovered their bodies together in a corner, a truly tragic sight. It was also learned that Zhang Liushi was in her sixties and had been paralyzed for many years. Her son, Zhang Bochen, was a businessman in Tianjin, and Zhang Wangshi was responsible for all household affairs, serving her mother-in-law with filial piety, which was universally praised. Most notably, despite Zhang Liushi's paralysis for years, Zhang Wangshi consistently cared for her, administering medicine and tending to her needs, which was highly commended by the neighbors. Her daughter, Cuifeng, had attended Qingzhen Girls' Elementary School and was not only raised by her mother's teachings but also influenced by her teachers, enabling her to deeply understand righteousness. She followed her mother to rescue her grandmother, resulting in their simultaneous death. The three bodies were carried downstairs by the firefighters and were fortunately mostly intact, with only slight scorching on the fingers and toes. Their relative, Wangshi, had already purchased coffins and arranged for their temporary storage at the Jingjiang Public Hall. Zhang Liushi was sixty years old, Zhang Wangshi was thirty-nine years old, and Zhang Cuifeng was seventeen years old, all registered in Shanghai. After reviewing the report, Yuan noted that Zhang Wangshi had already been downstairs before the fire and was in a safe location. However, out of concern for her sick aunt, she disregarded the dangerous flames and rushed back to save her. Her daughter, Cuifeng, eagerly joined her, their actions motivated by deep affection and disregard for their own safety, resulting in their tragic demise. Their deeds were worthy of special recognition and encouragement. Therefore, he first presented them with a plaque inscribed with the four characters "Exemplary Filial Piety" for immediate display. He also submitted a report to the municipal government, requesting a generous commendation to inspire moral behavior and comfort the souls of the departed. Mayor Zhang Qun, after reviewing the report, approved the granting of a plaque inscribed with the four characters "Teach Filial Piety and Encourage Moral Customs" as a commendation.</p>
<h3>Water Police</h3>
<p>Capture of Pirate Leader Shen Qinggang</p>
<p>Large numbers of pirates have repeatedly appeared in the waters off Wusongkou and the counties of Chongming and Qiqi, landing to loot residents' property. Zhu Bingzheng, the Fourth District Chief of the Wusong Water Police, dispatched a large team of water police to suppress them. However, the pirate ships had already fled upon hearing the news. Subsequently, Zhu Fukuan, the Squad Leader of the Seventeenth Platoon of the district, learned that the pirate leader, Shen Qinggang, was hiding in the Xin'an Town area. He secretly went to the location around 4 PM the previous afternoon and apprehended Shen, taking him to the Seventeenth Platoon headquarters. Under questioning by Platoon Leader Gong Jinqin, Shen confessed that he was thirty-five years old, from Haizhou, and had over a hundred followers and many sailing ships. He stated that all the robberies were planned and directed by him and that his second-in-command, Lu Qinglang, was currently in charge of everything on the pirate ships, whereabouts unknown. He also admitted that the recent robberies of merchant ships, such as the Dachangli and Fengxiang, were also orchestrated by him. After receiving the confession, Platoon Leader Gong immediately telegraphed District Chief Zhu for approval and transferred Shen to the Chongming County government for trial.</p>
<h3>Dispute Among Tea Servers on the New Jiangtian Steamer</h3>
<p>The Reason: A Dispute Over Rooms</p>
<p>The two hundred-plus tea servers on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's New Jiangtian steamer, which operates between Shanghai and Ningbo, have long had disagreements. They are divided into two factions: one affiliated with the Seamen's Union and the other with the Anli Union (now renamed the Shanghai-Ningbo Union). Recently, the opinions of both sides have become increasingly extreme, stemming from a dispute over rooms. All the rooms on the steamer are assigned by the business director, with no inherent bias. However, the Shanghai-Ningbo faction intentionally made things difficult for the other faction (Seamen's Union). A fight broke out between the two sides in Ningbo the day before yesterday. Yesterday, after the steamer arrived in Shanghai, a dispute erupted again around 4 PM between the Shanghai-Ningbo factions. The steamer director tried to dissuade them to no avail, and they even attempted to assault him. The police were notified and arrived to arrest several dozen people from both sides. Around 5 PM, someone named Jin mediated a resolution, and the situation was diffused. The steamer's departure was reportedly delayed by about an hour.</p>
<h3>Nephew Accused of Seizing Inheritance</h3>
<p>Two Daughters Grown Up and Suing for Return of Property</p>
<p>Li Guisong, a villager from He Wangzhai in the Jiangwan District, passed away due to illness on October 29, 1926. His wife also died on December 16 of the same year. Li had no sons, only three daughters. The second daughter was adopted by another family. Now, only two daughters remain: the eldest, Lin Nan, and the youngest, Yin Nan, both of whom were young children at the time. Their inheritance was managed by their nephew, Jiang Shisheng (son of Li Guisong's older sister). Now that Lin Nan and Yin Nan have grown up, they requested a division of the inheritance, but Jiang refused. Lin Nan and Yin Nan hired lawyer Qu Yue to sue Jiang Shisheng in the district court for seizing the inheritance and refusing to return it. The lawsuit stated that after their father, Li Guisong, passed away, he left behind twenty-one mu of fertile land, five houses, over twenty dan of cotton, and fifteen dan of wheat, totaling approximately seven to eight thousand yuan. They requested that, as biological daughters, they be returned all of the inheritance to manage it themselves. Yesterday morning, Judge Tong Shenglü held a hearing. The plaintiffs, Li Lin Nan, Li Yin Nan, Sun Bingfa (as Yin Nan's representative), and the lawyer Qu Yue hired by the plaintiffs, all appeared in court. The plaintiffs testified about the previous events. The judge, noting the defendant's absence, did not open the debate and ordered that the defendant be summoned to court again for a joint review.</p>
<h3>Hotel Owner Accused of Fraud</h3>
<p>Even When the Hotel Could Not Be Maintained, He Still Collected Deposits From Tea Servers</p>
<p>The Plaintiffs Wept Bitterly</p>
<p>Ji Zhongwen, the owner of the Huizhong Hotel in Tong'an Lane on Hankou Road, was recently sued in the Special District Court by the entire staff, Cao Zhongyun, Xu Quangen, Du Atao, Xu Aquan, Ling Jinlin, and twenty others, who hired a lawyer to file criminal charges against Ji for fraud. After being sued, Ji also hired a lawyer to sue Du, Xu, and Ling for illegally detaining his son, Shen　, using violence and infringing on his freedom. The two cases were previously summoned once, but were postponed due to the hope of a settlement. However, Ji Zhongwen had no sincere intention of settling, leading to a breakdown. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Cheng Shangfeng of the Special District Court continued the hearing in the fifth courtroom. In the case against Ji Zhongwen, thirteen plaintiffs appeared, electing Cao Zhongxue as their representative. Cao stated that he was over sixty years old and worked as an accountant with Xu Quangen. The rest were tea servers who had collectively paid deposits of 3,530 yuan to Ji. However, Ji did not hand over the money to the accountant but secretly took it home for his own use. The hotel was owned solely by Ji, who had leased it from someone for 6,000 yuan in early February last year, with a monthly rent of 430 yuan. The hotel was now sealed because it owed the landlord, Hartung, seven months' rent, totaling 3,000 yuan. All of their clothes and belongings were locked inside, leaving them without food or shelter. He expressed feeling oppressed by the landlord's power, speaking with tears in his eyes, a truly pitiful sight. Judge Cheng asked Cao why they didn't try to maintain the business. Cao replied that although the hotel's assets were worth 6,000 yuan, they had once discussed having someone named Yao continue the business, agreeing to pay the 3,000 yuan rent. However, the landlord demanded a large commission, and after repeated pleading, they reduced it to 900 yuan. Yao paid 900 yuan in cash and issued a check for 3,000 yuan. However, the landlord insisted on cash, and the deal fell through. The plaintiff's lawyer argued that Ji continued to collect deposits even when he could not maintain the business, constituting fraudulent behavior. Now that Ji has fled, they requested an arrest warrant. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Cheng ruled that the case of Ji Zhongwen suing Du, Xu, and Ling was not accepted. The case against Ji Zhongwen was postponed for seven days for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Russian Upset Over Death of a Dog</h3>
<p>Cross-Border Police Car Crushes a Puppy</p>
<p>Russian Could Not Bear It and Stepped Forward to Beat</p>
<p>The Cross-Border Police No. 223 of the French Concession was driving a car at around 6 PM the previous afternoon. When passing Avenue du Père Huc by Avenue Joffre, it almost hit a puppy on the side of the road. A Russian named Garmen, witnessing this and feeling indignant, stepped forward and, without asking what happened, struck the Cross-Border Police in the face with the musical instrument he was carrying, causing him to bleed. A patrolman arrived and took the Russian into custody at the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the French Court for questioning. The plaintiff first complained about the beating. A witness named Zhao Wanjin testified that he saw the defendant commit the assault. The defendant, represented by lawyer Mutiyi, argued that the defendant was genuinely upset by what he saw and acted out of momentary anger, therefore he stepped forward to intervene. The defendant was usually well-behaved and had never argued with anyone. This was his first offense, and he requested leniency. The Chinese and Western judge ruled that the defendant should not have committed the assault and fined him ten yuan, with a one-year suspended sentence, and ordered him to compensate the plaintiff for ten taels of silver.</p>
<p>Public Concession</p>
<h3>Problem of House Numbering</h3>
<p>New Style Numbering Method</p>
<p>Adopting a Gradual Approach</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Gazette stated that the Council had previously appointed Mr. Barker, Mr. Zhou Pingxian (transliteration), Mr. Pant, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Allen to form a special committee to discuss adopting a new house numbering method for new and old roads within the concession that needed renumbering. After several meetings, and a detailed review of the current methods and reports from various offices of the Council and other parties, the results of the deliberations are detailed below:</p>
<p>The committee felt that there was a need to improve the current numbering method, but it did not advocate for a complete overhaul immediately, as this would lead to a huge increase in expenses and cause various inconveniences to the residents. Moreover, address information on various communication documents, insurance policies, name registers, etc., would need to be changed, and various public and private organizations would face unnecessary work. In several roads within the concession, house numbers were not in order due to the frequent renovations or additions of buildings. The committee believed that it was necessary to change these, but only when absolutely necessary. However, roads such as Jing'an Temple Road, Tongfu Road, Medhurst Road, Jiangxi Road, and Ningbo Road, which had extremely disorganized house numbers, needed to be changed immediately. The committee strongly supported adopting the Council's previously proposed method of odd-even numbering. This method involved placing odd and even numbers in close proximity, facing each other, with a spacing of twelve feet per number being the most appropriate. In the future, when buildings were added alongside the roads, there would be no need for further changes. Numbering the numerous and disorganized alleys within the concession was particularly difficult. The best solution was to assign each alley a number, with the numbers continuing sequentially from the adjacent buildings. The houses within the alleys would be assigned additional numbers, with even numbers on the right and odd numbers on the left, to ensure clarity. The current method of adding letters was best suited for houses in alleys. According to the above methods, postal communication could be addressed on main roads as "Mr. So-and-so, So-and-so Road, So-and-so Road," and within alleys as "Mr. So-and-so, So-and-so Lane, So-and-so Number, So-and-so Road." The committee also felt that it would be more appropriate to call alleys "branch roads" rather than "lanes." The practice of having separate numbering systems for Western-style and Chinese-style buildings on roads within the concession should be abolished. The house numbering method should be consistent across all roads, with north-south roads numbered from the south end, with odd numbers on the east side and even numbers on the west side. East-west roads should be numbered from the east end, with odd numbers on the south side and even numbers on the north side. However, the numbering system for roads in the eastern district of the concession should be an exception, with numbering progressing from west to east, as the numbering of houses on all roads generally expanded outward from the center of the city. Mr. Baker had previously submitted opinions on the house numbering method, and the committee asked him to explain everything. Mr. Baker attended the meeting on April 10 and delivered a very long speech. The committee members only reviewed it in detail. In summary, the committee believed that all the proposals were suitable for the current situation. It was proposed that this method be used as a guide for the future, as each number would occupy twelve feet of space and would be permanent, without the need for further changes. However, this method should be implemented first on roads where renumbering was necessary, with the rest being implemented gradually. A full implementation should take several years to minimize inconvenience to the residents.</p>
<h3>Wall Collapse During Demolition</h3>
<p>House Collapses</p>
<p>Around 4 PM yesterday, during the demolition of the high wall on the west side of the old site of the Great Southeast Tobacco Company in Taihe Lane, Nan Chujiaqiao, Avenue de la Marne, French Concession, the wall suddenly collapsed due to incomplete procedures, causing part of the houses and piled firewood of the Laoganyan firewood and charcoal depot at No. 167 Rue Glocque to collapse. Fortunately, an old clerk at the depot escaped quickly, avoiding disaster. Upon hearing the news, the Grande Cloche Fire Brigade immediately rushed to the scene.

<h3>Under Despotic Marriage</h3>
<p>Chen Lindi Commits Suicide by Taking Opium</p>
<p>Fiancé of Inferior Talent and Appearance</p>
<p>Father Kills Daughter's Life</p>
<p>Chen Lifeng, residing at No. 5 and a half Guangxi Road, is over forty years old and works at a certain cinema. He has a daughter named Lindi, who is twenty-nine years old and still unmarried. Chen was eager to fulfill his long-held wish without consulting his daughter and hastily arranged a marriage with a certain son. Upon learning of this and discovering that her fiancé was of inferior talent and appearance and suffered from poverty, she was constantly worried. Chen remained unaware. As the wedding date approached, he specially prepared wedding attire for her. As time was running out and she could not change the situation, Lindi had a death wish. Early the previous morning, she secretly swallowed opium paste. When discovered, she was rushed to Guangren Hospital for treatment, but the poisoning was too severe. She died at 9 PM that night. The Zhabei police station received a report and sent detectives to transport the body to the Fielun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, they reported to the Special District Court and requested that Prosecutor Guo come to the morgue for an examination. He sat in the public position and questioned the deceased's parents before ordering Chen Lifeng to sign a statement and claim the body for coffin burial.</p>

<p>Establishment of National Jinan University Bank</p>
<p>The original school bank of National Jinan University was established, but its scale was small, and its finances were confused with those of the university, leading to many malpractices. Therefore, President Zheng strived to improve it. In addition to handing over all the university's finances to accountant Pan Xulun for management, he also hired several other committee members to prepare for the establishment of the Jinan University Bank. It is completely independent, separated from the university's finances, and its business scope and procedures are exactly the same as ordinary commercial banks. All kinds of trust, remittance, current, and fixed deposits and loans are within the scope of its business. Not only teachers and students of the university can do business with the bank, but all villagers in the Zhenru area are sincerely welcome to do business with the bank. Among the staff, the general manager is Ye Yuanjun, and the directors are President Zheng, Vice President Hong, Dean Yang, and a dozen or so giants from Shanghai banks. It is reported that the capital is prepared to raise 500,000 yuan, and 200,000 to 300,000 yuan has already been raised. The bank is located within Jinan University, and students from the Jinan University Business School can practice in the bank every day. The bank can hire fewer employees and save expenses, while students can gain more experience and be better prepared for future work. It is truly a win-win situation. The bank opened yesterday, and Manager Ye prepared tea and refreshments to welcome guests to visit and report on the organization process. He also welcomed the villagers of Zhenru to understand the meaning of saving, not to waste money, to save surplus money, and to deposit it in the bank for emergencies. It is said that the villagers of Zhenru, under the guidance of the students of the university, have more knowledge than other villagers and have always trusted the university very much. They will definitely transfer their trust in the university to the bank, and the development of the bank is just beginning. (Mu Bu Jing)</p>
<h3>The Problem of the Role of Cyrano · Jun</h3>
<p>The news of the Fudan Drama Society's rehearsal of Cyrano has been publicized for a long time, and many friends who love drama and art have been looking forward to it for many days. However, they have not yet announced a definite date for the public performance, so there are various speculations from the outside world. According to the latest news I know about Cyrano, there have been some changes from before. I will truthfully report it as follows to comfort the friends who are waiting for Cyrano.</p>
<p>The role of Cyrano in the play is the most important role in the entire play. It was originally played by Hong Shen, the director of the society, himself. The play has already been rehearsed for one act. Later, because Hong Jun felt that his responsibility for the entire play was extremely important, and he also played the lead role, he was afraid of neglecting one thing or another. Coincidentally, Ma Yanxiang, an old classmate of the school, had just returned to Shanghai from Guangdong. Hong Jun decided to let Ma Jun play the role of Cyrano. Ma Jun has been engaged in the Chinese drama movement for a long time and is rich in acting experience. He will definitely make us satisfied with this role. In addition, the role of Roxane, the female lead in the play, was reportedly played by Chen Chenying, the wife of Ma Yanxiang, when the play was decided to be rehearsed last year. Later, Ms. Chen left Shanghai, so Jin Zhongyu, who was famous for playing "Parasitic Grass," was invited to replace her. However, Ms. Jin was unable to accept the role for some reason, so it was finally decided that Liang Peishu would play the role. There are rumors that Yu Zhaobi will play the role, but that is just speculation.</p>
<p>The play is now being rehearsed day and night in the Zibin Academy of the school. According to Hong Shen, the director of the society, it is expected to be performed around June 10.</p>
<h3>School News of Annie Morrill Smith School for Girls</h3>
<p>We often read about the life news of various schools in this publication, but our Annie Morrill Smith School for Girls is uniquely silent. It is truly shameful to say the least. I am not afraid of my shallow writing now, and boldly write something to contribute to the readers.</p>
<p>Today, our basketball team is indeed very strong. The defender is Ms. Chen Xiangwei, an athlete who transferred from Zhongxi. She is an all-rounder who is proficient in everything. She is also a champion in tennis. Who in the school does not know her? There is also Ms. Ling Anna, the younger sister of Ling Xianchang, who plays defender on the basketball team. They relied on the two of them to win the game against Chongde Girls' School a few days ago.</p>
<p>We also have pranksters and tycoons here. Their methods of teasing teachers are even more powerful than those of the male students, especially for novice teachers. Once, in a mathematics class, the teacher was said to be a graduate of the prestigious S University. When he entered the classroom, he looked very proud. But as soon as he opened his mouth, almost all of us laughed because he spoke in a low voice and did not dare to look at us. When we saw him like this, we wanted to look at him even more, making his face flushed and restless. It was not easy to hear the bell ring, and he ran out of the classroom in three steps, and then we giggled for a while. (Qiong)</p>
<h3>Love Causes a War of Words</h3>
<p>The School of Social Sciences of C University moved to Zhabei from W last year. Its dormitory is located on the only route for students commuting to N Girls' School. In this sunny weather with bright spring and easily moved spring feelings, it is of course inevitable that students from the two schools will convey their feelings through eye contact, gradually to correspondence, and achieve the so-called result of love.</p>
<p>At first, only Mr. L of C University and Ms. L of N Girls' School had a passionate love. However, in just half a year, there are now more than a dozen lovers. According to my personal investigation, it is true that the infectiousness of love is just like the infectiousness of Shanghai fashion. I only regret that Ala did not live in that dormitory, otherwise, maybe there would be an object too.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the principal of N Girls' School, of course, this is detrimental to the school spirit. In order to prevent the spread of the love craze among students of the two schools, she specifically wrote a letter to the president of N University, saying in brief, "...The school spirit of our school has always been well-known in Shanghai. Since your school moved here, many love affairs have occurred, which seems to be caused by the lax discipline of your school. Your school should be relocated immediately to benefit both parties..."</p>
<p>The authorities of C University specifically brought this matter up for discussion at the school affairs meeting and decided to answer like this, "...Our school's students have always strictly abided by the rules in W. Only after being adjacent to your school did such unfortunate events occur, which clearly your school should be blamed for. Your school is specially requested to relocate as soon as possible to avoid harming the studies of students from both sides..."</p>
<p>After this letter was sent, N Girls' School reportedly replied with a letter with even more severe wording. C University is preparing to deal with it through legal procedures. If it is not resolved soon, it is feared that the turmoil will escalate. As for who should move, this is of course a matter for the Shanghai court, but there is no explicit provision in the law and no precedent to follow. I am a bit embarrassed for the judge. I still hope that it will not be resolved in court. (Ma Fangzhai)</p>
<h3>University Movie Fever · Wei · Yin</h3>
<p>Movies, this emerging eighth art, this silver enjoyment, this daily dream, are extremely warmly welcomed by students in our universities.</p>
<p>After just watching The Merry Widow, Jeanette MacDonald became the center of faith for male students. March in it became the most popular song among students, "Good morning, Your Majesty." This seductive sentence became the greeting between students.</p>
<p>A discerning student caught the shortcoming of the university students and specially rented a film from Shanghai to screen it in the school's gymnasium. The price was only 20 cents, so it naturally attracted a lot of audiences.</p>
<p>The film screened this time was a sensation in the city |</p>
<p>'Red-Headed Woman'</p>
<p>This hot woman has descended upon the university. Her beautiful and healthy body, her charming posture, her lively expression, and her annoying appearance, called a group of "women, songs, and blood" university students to gather in the gymnasium, which is usually occupied by a group of athletes. Couples came hand in hand after dinner, their eyes focused on the tempting advertising pictures on the billboard, and naturally walked into the gymnasium together, sitting among the crowd and talking heartfelt love words. The classmates passing by glared at them fiercely, their eyes filled with the poisonous flames of jealousy.</p>
<p>Dr. Yuan, who teaches philosophy, also came with his young sister. He still put on the face of a philosopher, inviolably raising his face. The female classmates next to him, like butterflies, were staring at him and laughing secretly.</p>
<p>The lights finally dimmed, and the movie progressed scene by scene. The plot was relaxed and tense, and the students' minds changed constantly.</p>
<p>When there was a kissing expression on the screen, the male students in the pool shouted good, while the female students blushed, and the sound of hissing was mixed with the sound of mouth kissing.</p>
<p>The lights came on again, and the words "Goodbye" were projected on the screen. The university students dragged their lazy bodies back to the dormitory from extreme exhaustion and had a very sweet dream that night.</p>
<p>University movie fever, this is really the leap of youth.</p>
<h3>Student Soldiers Mutiny · Xi</h3>
<p>Who doesn't know that the Fudan Student Army was established before the May 3rd Massacre? Who doesn't know that the Fudan Student Army went to Hangzhou twice to show off? The regiment commander, Dong Yuanqing, was indeed very enthusiastic, and the coach, Zhou Jiada, was indeed very serious. When Minister Shi Zhaoji came to inspect last year, he thought he was very satisfied and praised him greatly. This year, the training of new recruits continued as before, and the spirit was very good, but unexpectedly, a mutiny occurred a few days ago. The reason was that the dew on the grass in the morning was not dry, and they had to kneel down to aim during training. This day, they knelt on the grass for a full half an hour, and Qiu Jiu's military trousers were all wet, which caused a mutiny. Regiment Commander Dong believed that the soldiers were unwilling to serve, and resigned to the president in anger.</p>
<h3>The Story of World Literature (I) (V) (IX) Translated by Hu Zhongchi, written by John Macy of America</h3>
<p>Chapter 40: The Classical Age of German Literature</p>
<p>Just like Arnold and Emerson and Morley, whether we know it ourselves or not, we are all disciples of Goethe. Any liberal person who comes into contact with this master will understand that becoming his disciple is inevitable. Rather than moral formalism, it is to unite the moral energy; rather than international antagonism, it is to unite the world; and in literature, life, politics, and thought, it is to cultivate the essence of things in the face of the value of myth. Anyone can draw infinite inspiration and strength and light from this one person's life, model, writing, or even the letters and short satires he wrote occasionally.</p>
<p>Goethe is a great poet, but he is far more than that. Some of his formal works, such as the novels "Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship" and "Elective Affinities," and some of his dramas, are not the easiest reads in today's world. What compensates for this fact is that he is infinitely more than a poet.</p>
<p>When Goethe was young, he was a student of Gottsched and the French style in Leipzig and wrote the love poems of the Anacreontic style that were customary at the time. He went from Leipzig to Strasbourg, where he met Herder, who enlightened him about the treasures of folk poetry. Almost overnight, he became a first-class lyric poet. Then came the Shakespeare worship craze, the age of decadence and the romantic sorrow of "Storm and Stress." This was manifested by the novel "The Sorrows of Young Werther," which swept across Europe and earned Goethe international fame at the age of twenty-four.</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>May 23, 1920 (Shen Bao Edition)</p>
<p>This promising young man was invited to the court of Weimar. There, although there were short intervals from time to time, he spent his long life. He took the draft of the first part of "Faust" to Weimar. He completed the second part there sixty-five years later. Then came busy and annoying years, a retreat to Italy, and the classical age. During this time, he wrote the dramas "Iphigenia," "Torquato Tasso," etc., the gorgeous Venetian-style satires, and the delicate pastoral poem "Hermann and Dorothea." His middle age and old age until extreme old age were devoted to politics, the development of the theater, physical and biological science, the writing of autobiographies, and the completion of "Faust." However, in all periods of his life, there was an uninterrupted stream of lyric poetry. This stream, in scope, passion, wisdom, and music, has not been surpassed by any other poet.</p>
<p>No matter what he was doing, he never forgot "Faust." He started writing the drama when he was twenty-three and completed it when he was eighty-three. It is filled with the incomparable spiritual inspiration and wisdom of his mind. The story is extremely simple. Faust is a scholar who yearns for life. He knows that salvation lies not in theory but in experience. Under the guidance of Mephistopheles, the spirit of negation and evil, he throws himself into the world of living experience. He tries wild pleasure, carnal love, power, and assimilation with classical antiquity. All these experiences still do not give him satisfaction. He finds ultimate satisfaction in the most simple and practical service to his fellow men. However, this is only a stage in his pursuit; it is not the goal. The path itself is the goal. Life is its own purpose and must be justified from within. Completion is beyond the realm we can reach. We do not know what it is, but in fact, to the human mind, it is very similar to stagnation and death. From this point of view, our highest achievement is noble effort, a tireless creative life. It is that which saves Faust and defeats Mephistopheles, and it is the affirmation of that truth that welcomes Faust into the eternal army.</p>
