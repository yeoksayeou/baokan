<p>時評</p>
<h3>日議議會開始</h3>
<p>在議會制度之下。而曰無爭。未之聞也。不過於爭之中。而能兼顧國家大局。不固執私意。如近日英自由黨與工黨合作。以避海海會危險。德國權黨贊助政府黨。以免陷紛亂。已爲難能可貴之政黨矣。其他則每不肯犧牲成見。政府黨則專以壓迫在野黨。使不能發抒政見爲快。在野黨則專以攻擊政府黨。使必達推倒目的爲能。此政局之所以常紛擾而不定也。</p>
<p>日本自大選舉告成後。各方面所蘊積之種種困難問題。均將於今日之會議一洩之。如軍縮協定。金解禁善後。義務敎育。農村對案。工人失業等問題。已難解决。而臨時又加以東京市電氣工人空前大罷工之風潮。更予政府以大打擊。且反對方面。除與政府黨敵對之政友會外。尙有貴族派軍人派無產派等政見不合之議員。窺伺於後。故說者謂此次之會議。實爲日政府之一大難關。然吾謂此難關之是否眞成難關。要亦視雙方之用心與手段何如耳。若政府與黨。不能放大眼光。而仍欲挾其多數黨之勢力。壓伏一切。以謀獨占正副長委員長等重要位置。擴張權威。爲制勝工具。以嚴限議議會時間。使反對黨無從發言。爲戒備要策。則愈激反對黨之忿怒。今日之會議。縱幸免破裂。而日後危機正多。此下策中之又下策也。若反對政府黨。不能堂堂正正。從國計民生上着想。糾正政府之誤謬。設法解除環境之困難。以安人民。而專乘間尋𨻶。以事報復。以攻政府。以恢復以前權勢爲惟一目的。則非特未必能如願以償。即幸而政權仍還我手中。亦豈能有補於國家。此亦失策之甚者也。故吾謂日政局安危之前途。不在今日問題之難易。而在雙方之能否覺悟</p>

<h3>全國敎育會議第七日</h3>
<p>昨日舉行第四次大會</p>
<p>通過識字運動臨時案</p>
<p>議畢初中社敎三計劃</p>
<p>今晨續開第五次大會</p>
<p>明晨大會後下午閉幕</p>
<p>昨第四次大會情形</p>
<p>全國敎育會議、昨爲第七日、開第四次大會、及舉行敎費審查會、茲將情形錄下、</p>
<h3>開會情形</h3>
<p>下午二點鐘振鈴開會、主席仍爲副議長陳和銑、先恭讀總囑、全體肅立、次開議吳稚暉等臨時提議之擬請敎育部在最短期内積極的提倡識字運動一案、</p>
<h3>議識字運動案</h3>
<p>▲衆無異議通過</p>
<p>劉湛恩起立謂、如無異議、本案即作爲通過、主席發問、大衆並無異議、作爲通過</p>
<h3>討論初敎計劃</h3>
<p>｜議决｜</p>
<p>（一）幼稚園應皆華人辦理</p>
<p>（二）衛生敎育應特殊訓練</p>
<p>（三）訓育與課程須分開</p>
<p>（四）小學幼稚園以不收費</p>
<p>爲原則</p>
<p>（五）各省得設特殊學校</p>
<p>▲設置</p>
<p>熊夢飛謂、客查報告、將設置項下第六條删除任何國家之初等敎育、應由國人辦理、萬不能令外人可以任意辦理、所以應第六條保留、有陳德徵黎照寰等附議、</p>
<p>衛挺生謂、此點須考慮、他取消治外法權如不許外人設立小學、則外國僑民子弟之讀書問題、將發生恐慌、故無保留之必要、我人祇須發揮本國之義務敎育、使中國子弟不入外國學校、</p>
<p>劉湛恩謂、現今中國境内之大中小學、原由外人辦理者、現均國人主持、衹須不違背中國敎育定章、儘可令彼設立、在提倡敎育普及之時、尤須使此等學校存在爲推行義敎之助、</p>
<p>陶玄謂、衛先生之以爲六條一删、則外國人欲敎育自己子弟將不得設立小學、此點實爲過慮、小學及幼稚園爲基本敎育、應由國人辦理、實有保之必要、</p>
<p>黃建中謂、設置項下、第六條爲本計劃之最重要一問題、本席以爲實有保留之必要、其理由已由熊陶兩先生述之、且外國信仰宗敎之家庭、即在幼時薰陶、故幼時之敎育、實爲染黃染蒼之時期、不可不愼、若不如是、則三民主義之精神、將因之喪失、</p>
<p>謝樹英謂、基督敎之所辦敎育、有六千八百九十所、</p>
<p>討論多時主張維持原方案（原案即「非中人民或非完全中國人民組織的團體、不得設置小學幼稚園、小學爲幼稚園的敎員職員、均以完全籍隸於中華民國的人民爲限」）者、以多數通過、</p>
<p>▲課程</p>
<p>金寳善謂、第九條醫生兼負衛生敎育之責任、實難昨其人、世界上現僅二三人、故應有特殊訓練、俾養成適當人才、金即以鉛印韋慤附金寳善之議、以爲三民主義之敎育、須注意康健敎育、俞子夷附、將意見書送大會編纂科修訂條文、</p>
<p>▲訓育</p>
<p>陳德徵謂、以訓育併人課程、本席反對、在三民主義之下、須特别注意訓育、故宜仍留訓育一項陳鶴琴謂、初敎育與中學大學相異、故宜併訓育敎務爲一、以便實施整個敎育、萬不能以訓育與敎務分家、</p>
<p>陳德徵謂、訓育課程之分例、並非示絶對分開、其怕以另立者、爲表示注重黨的精神、</p>
<p>陳鶴琴謂、非訓育應三民主義化、課程亦應三民主義化、故今併爲課程一章、無害於黨的精神、俞子夷謂、草案爲分開、審查會則合併爲一組、照審查會合併爲課條文有不妥處、故附陳德徵之議、贊成分立、主席付表决、贊成訓育分立者、以多數通過、</p>
<p>▲費用</p>
<p>陳德徵謂、審查會定「每學期至多不得過二元、」可否改爲「小學幼稚園以不收費爲原則、地方生活富裕之處、得斟量收費、由各市縣就各小學幼稚園所在地方生活狀况、分别規定、呈請上級敎育行政機關、核准施行、」得多數通過、</p>
<p>鄭洪年提議費用第三條應删去、少數·未通過、</p>
<p>▲學級編制</p>
<p>陳劍脩謂、修正條文第四條應删去、因設立特殊兒童學校與社會敎育相混、故可删去、得孟憲承附議、汪懋祖謂、低能敎育在各國慣例、列入社會敎育、至天才敎育、則列入普通小學之中、其條文如下、各省應酌量地方需要及經濟能力設置特殊學校、如天才學校等、各市縣酌設特殊兒童班、</p>

<p>（一）中等學校訓育綱要、</p>
<p>（二）中學優秀生提升辦法、</p>
<p>（三）中學貧寒學生之獎且辦法、</p>
<h3>討論中等敎育</h3>
<p>｜議决｜</p>
<p>（一）高中普師商家科與農工</p>
<p>高中之比例</p>
<p>（二）私中立案四年得津貼</p>
<p>（三）其他除經費項保留外均</p>
<p>通過</p>
<p>韋慤謂審查報告大體甚善、惟關於職業指導敎育指導略形缺乏、故應請中等敎育組注意、</p>
<p>趙迺傳謂、比二項實應事補充、</p>
<p>▲規定中學的設置</p>
<p>莊澤宣謂中等普通科之限制、所以謀中學生之求職業訓練、便利、本席以爲普通科與農二科各占半數之規定、不甚妥當、「丙項第一條、」應改爲一與三之比例、即普通科一所、農工科三所是「丙項第二條」則可仍歡</p>
<p>汪懋祖、謂辦農工科甚難、普通科亦不可不注意、例如陜西省有西北大學、而無高中、故學生升舉困難、須至他省、高中後、方得考升大學、就江蘇論、中學共二十一所、如須十四所改辦農工科高中、則設備等費、須數百萬元、事實上、恐甚困難、</p>
<p>唐世承謂、方案中所謂普通科已包商科師範科及京事科等、故各占半數之比例、乃與農工科之比例、請大家注意、且農工科之校數與普通科各半、在各省論已須改辦若干校、故數量上、已與普通科接近、</p>
<p>歐元懷謂、商科不應列入普通科中、宜亦視爲職業科、故本席以爲普通科高中與農工商之高中、占一與三之比例、</p>
<p>黎照宸附歐元懷之議、其理由有二、（一）大學有農工商學院、中學亦應有農工商科、（二）爲小商店養成職員計、當有中學商科之設、</p>
<p>趙迺傳謂商科之列入普通科、就經費着眼、以商科設備較農工科爲簡單也、非就職業方面着眼、以農工爲職學敎育而不以商科爲職學敎育、</p>
<p>劉湛恩贊成商業與農工合爲一列、</p>
<p>陳布雷謂、中等敎育組、非不承商科爲職業敎育、所以農工兩科之提出、無非爲訓政時期、謀增進國民生產計也、</p>
<p>朱經農謂、不應以商農工等分大淸、民生主義之敎育、均因有職業化、故農工之分列、無非對於經費着眼、</p>
<p>孟憲承謂、本節内項、並改爲高級中學普通科師範科商科家事科與農工高中之比例、得多數能過、</p>
<p>▲整頓私立中學</p>
<p>陳德徵提謂、本節第三條甲項、應取消、</p>
<p>趙迺傳謂審查組改辦理七年、係指新立學校而言、所以須定七年者、必視其畢業生之成績也、陳德徵謂、初中畢業祇三年、毋須規定七年、如私立中學限制太嚴、則無異以爲公立中學必優良、而私立中學必不良、故宜删去、以爲熱心辦學者勸、</p>
<p>趙迺傳謂、原案本爲四年、審查組則改爲七年、陳德徵提議謂、第三節甲項必須取消、得鄭洪年之附議、</p>
<p>朱經農謂、本案可分應否删否及七年四年三種一表决主席付表决、應否删去及七年、均以少數未通過、其結果、維持原方案爲私中案四年以上得津貼、</p>
<p>▲規定中學與大學小學銜</p>
<p>接辦法</p>
<p>黃建中謂、大學一切設施、如根據高中、恐有弊病、因大學程度不能提高也、又本節中、對於專科學校未注意、可否删去、</p>
<p>趙迺傳謂、審查會文字將修正、分發諸位、故現在可不必拘泥字裏行間、</p>
<p>▲經費預算</p>
<p>俞慶棠謂、本章除經費保留外、其餘可付通過、衆無異議、主席即宣告、休息十分鐘、</p>

<p>大學重學理、專校重應用、此種觀念、近來雖已打破、而東西各國仍多專校與大學並列、吾國高等敎育、向分大學與專門兩種、民國十二年全國分私立專門以上學校共一百二十五除大學爲三十五外、專門學校凡九十、迨十四年專門學校减爲八十五、（以上據中華敎育改進社歷年統計）十五年减爲六十二、（據前北京敎育部全國專門以上學校一覽）現則合新設國立專科學校計之僅爲五十、而限期結朿之公私立法醫兩種專門學校約有二十、蓋自民國十三年以後專門學校多改爲大學、漸有偏廢之趨勢矣、向來專門學校之流弊、亦有可得而言者、淸季預備立憲、各省紛紛設立法政學校、民國初年、此風未衰、於是所謂專門學校、以屬於法政者、爲最多且濫、專憑講義、不備圖書、甚或學生平日不上課、届期可以畢業、農工商醫等專門學校、雖屬彼善於此、而課程空泛、不重實習、其弊亦甚、醫專年限短促、尤屬非宜、敎育部鑒於法與醫之關係社會生存民族生命至鉅、特於十八年七月明令公私立法醫兩種專門學校、只准辦至現有學生畢業爲止、自十八年度起、即不得再招新生、其餘各省立公立及已立案之私立農工商水產、圖書館各專門學校則令依照專科學校組織法及規程變更名稱組織、同時並咨請各省市政府就近考察地方情形、有無增設專科學校之必要、如有必要、究以何者爲最急、除吉林黑龍江新疆三省咨復無增設之必要、及山東河北福建三省已飭敎育廳核議尙未明白見復外、已經咨復者計有十八處、應設專科學校有三十五種之多、其中如森林農藝製革水產土木工程機械工程統計造紙礦冶畜牧蠶桑造船各專科學校、各省市尤認爲有及早設立之必要、（注一）而各機關法團之請求設立專校者、亦實繁有徒焉、（注二）</p>
<p>高等敎育在歐美雖多屬諸大學、而技術人材又多藉專科學校以養成之、各國學制不同、有形似專科而實大學者、如美國柯羅内托礦冶學校、以養成完全工程師自豪、修業年限四年、得授予學位、實爲大學性質、與吾國現制大學獨立學院相等、在法瑞德意尤多有名之專科學校、修業年限爲三年、功課極認眞、學生畢業後、國家社會全數任用、往往專科學校畢業生、較大學畢業生更受社會之歡迎、至於英國高等敎育、幾爲各有名大學所包辦、而各大學包含十餘以上之學校、或學院散處各地、學位文憑兩者並給、大學修業年限、大槪三年、專修科有一年二年之别、因之專科學校與大學之界限不易分、獨立之專科學校較占省數、</p>
<p>吾國幅員廣大、工業急宜發展、然每創辦一較大工廠必須外國工程師之籌畫及專門家之管理、出資旣巨、且所用機器每以所聘工程師之國籍爲轉移、美國人則主用美製、英國人則主用英製、····不論是項機器是否爲最新發明、徒以所𨽻國籍爲取舍標準、吾國此時所急需者爲可作工頭、技師工程師之各種人材、職業學校養成工頭大學養成工程師、專科學校則養成技師、實介乎工頭與工程師之間、初由專科學校畢業之學生、應使從工頭做起、漸升技師以至工程師、國家必先有此一般健全之技術專家爲中堅、乃能談實業革命、</p>
<p>或謂大學得設專修科、其人學資格、修業年限均與專科學校同、似無重設專科學校之必要、不知專科學校只限於應用科學及藝術、不似大學專修科之可涉及社會科學、大學所在之地如尚無專科學校、自可酌設與專科學校性質相類之專修科、其未有大學地方及有大學而無某科某系者、即應就地方之需要、籌設某種專科學校、况專科學校種類頗多、範圍甚小、因地制宜需欵有限、將來所造人材、正合訓政以後物質建設之用、除各省市應自籌經費開辦省立市立專科學校外、爰擬定籌設國立專科學校計畫如左、</p>
<p>第一國立森林專科學校　總理惓懷民生、曾將建造中國北部及中部森林一事、列爲實業計畫要目、近年水旱頻仍、民食不足、造林所以防災、亦所以增進糧食產量、故國立森林專科學校之設立、實爲當務之急、惟國立專校、注重培養造林專門人材、分配各地、是項學校設立之地點、宜求適中、廬山居中國中部、交通便利、牯嶺又爲中外人士遊憇之所、於此處造成模範林、旣壯觀瞻、亦便實習、安東靑島亦爲適當地點、將來應由遼寧省另設省立森林專科學校、靑島特别市另設市立森林專科學校、</p>
<p>第二國立紡織專科學校　就絲業論、中國產絲年約三百萬擔、江浙兩省較居大半、以較言之、江南所產之絲、其十分之九、織成綢緞、供國人之用、十公之一爲吾國之出口貨第一大宗、每年出口在十萬擔左右、（約價七千萬餘兩）由上海輸出者佔五分之三、又就棉業論長江下流爲吾國產棉最盛之區、南通常熟太倉嘉定上海均極有名、品質最佳、適於紡紗、而鄭州亦爲棉市中心、民國十一年、全國紗廠七十三家、上海最多佔二十八家、工人達三十萬、惜歐戰後、絲紗兩業均日漸衰敗、不能與外人工廠相抗衡、推其失敗原因、專家太少實其一端、茲爲利用敎育、以圖挽回利權起見、擬於無錫或鄭州、設一國立紡織專科學校、特别注重人造絲之研究、旣爲學生實習便利計、且以供該地方之需要也、（以上訓政時期第一年完成）</p>
<p>第三國立造紙專科學校　總理實業計畫中之第五計畫、其第五部即爲印刷工業内言、「現今中國報紙所用紙張、皆自外國輸入、紙爲傳達文化之重要工具、中國所有製紙原料不少、如西北天然森林揚子江附近蘆葦、皆可爲最良之紙料、」湖北諶家磯舊有造紙廠、國立造紙專科學校應即設於此地</p>
<p>第四國立礦冶專科學校　礦冶爲基本工業、亦即物質文明與經濟進步之最大主因、我國礦產西南最饒、雲南尤爲銅鐵銀錫等礦豐富之區、應即於昆明設一國立礦冶專科學校、（以上訓政時期第二年完成）</p>
<p>第五國立造船專科學校　總理實業計畫中之第三計畫其第五部、即爲創設造船廠内言、「以中國人價廉之勞工兵材料、固當比外國爲吾人所建所費較廉、且除航海隊以外、吾人尙須建造大隊内河淺水船及漁船、以船載此等小船、遠涉重洋、實際不易、故外國船廠不能爲吾造此等船隻、則中國於此際必須自備其船廠、自建其淺水船漁船船隊矣、」上海如國際貿易巨埠、長江通航門户、且已設有造船廠、可供學生之實習、故擬於該處設立國立船專科學校、</p>
<p>第六國立飛機製造專科校　法將福煦之言曰、「他日世界大戰必决於空中、」總理亦有航空救國之詔示、則航空事業之關係於國防、其重要可想、其在交通方面、飛機有火車輪船之效用、而其速力則較火車輪船超過十倍、靈通消息、經濟時間、均屬重要、吾國航空事業、現始萌芽、逐漸推廣飛機之需要必多、故擬於浦口設一飛機製造專科學校、並附設汽車製造科、（以上訓政時期第三年完成）</p>
<p>第七國立懇植專科學校　殖民蒙古新疆、爲總理實業第一計畫之第三部内言、「假能以科學之方法行吾人之殖民政策、則其收效將無倫比、」西北邊地荒昧、亟待開發、應先就地設立高中、程度之懇植學校、以爲殖民倡導、至國立懇殖專科學校、則以設在迪化爲最適宜、</p>
<p>第八國立畜牧專科學校　蒙古所產牛羊駝馬等家畜、種類旣優、數量亦巨、近查内蒙熱察綏三省、產駝絨四十八萬四千五百觔、羊毛二十六萬一千觔、牛皮二萬七千零二十張、馬皮一萬零九百一十張、羊皮七萬二千八百張、此外尙產山羊絨六七萬觔、狐毛十餘萬觔、凡此皆爲毛織製革之原料、而綏遠正有開辦毛革工廠之計畫、但欲發展毛革事業、須對於畜牧事業謀根本之改良、倘能利用自然牧塲、與以科學上之指導、則吾國畜牧事業、不難與美澳並駕齊驅、故擬於綏遠設一國立畜牧專科學校、並附設毛織班、製革班、（以上訓政時期第四年完成）</p>
<p>第九國立水產專科學校　吾國領海、除產蝦蟹江瑤柱蟶乾魚翅海參淡菜蜥皮鮑魚及各種魚鼈外、兼產殊貝玳琄等珍品、惜捕取未得法、遂令沿海漁業爲日人所操縱、吾國漁民以缺乏智識、故浸至朿手待斃、總理實業計畫、凡中國海岸起於高麗界之安東、止於近越南界之欽州、須設漁業港三十有一、平均每海岸線百英里、而得一港、中國这漁業計畫、於是始完成、欲振興水產敎育造就漁業人材、徒恃固有之水產職業學校、似尙不足、應於靑島設一國立水產專科學校、（訓政時期第五年完成）</p>
<p>第十國立工業專科學校　物質建設、端賴機械、非設一完全工業等科學校、不克自造機械瑞士幅員狹小、入口不過數百萬、尙有一著名也界之完全工業專科學校、設於楚玉息内、分建築土木工程、機械電氣化學、藥學森林、農業農村工程、數理師範自然科學軍事學十一科另有普通選修科、甲項爲文學歷史哲學經濟學、乙項爲數學自然科學工程學、及軍事學各科、並分設德法文班或意大利文班、吾國應於重慶設一與此相似之完全工業專科學校、特學科不必如是之廣泛複雜耳、（訓政時期第六年完成）</p>
<h3>余對全敎會之希望（盧紹稷）</h3>
<p>吾國此次全國敎育會議所討論之各種敎育方案、係遵照中國國民黨第三次全國代表大會所議决之中華民國敎育宗旨、「中華民國之敎育、根據三民主義、以充實人民活、扶植社會生存、發展國民生計、延續民族生命爲目的、務期民族獨立、民權普遍、民生發展、以促進世界於大同」　　孫貴定博士</p>
<p>、吾人可謂此與一九二三年、美國全國敎育聯合會所發起之「世界敎育會議」（Ｔｈｅ　Ｗｏｒｌｄ　Ｅｄｕｃａｔｉｏｎａｌ　Ｃｏｎｆｅｒｅｎｃｅ）之宗旨相同、蓋世界敎育會議宗旨、「謀國際敎育事業之合作、傳佈各國敎育消息、與促進各國親善、增進世界和平」、亦在謀世界之大同、</p>
<p>但余作本文之目的、不在將此次全國敎育會議與世界敎育會議、作一種比較、乃對此次全國敎育會議有三種希望、</p>
<p>（一）吾國此次全敎會議旣與世界敎育會議之宗旨相同、則此次會議似有對内對外兩方面、不僅須設法改善中國敎育、并須促進世界敎育、故希望與會諸敎育專家對於下列各點加以注意焉、</p>
<p>（一）如何能與各國敎育機關及敎育專家、互換敎育書報及論文、</p>
<p>（二）如何能與各國互換敎師、又津貼留學國外之學生的辦法應若何、</p>
<p>（三）是否應以學校敎科傳佈各國之國情與理想、</p>
<p>（四）是否宜倡設「國際敎育學院」、藉以聯合世界敎育、</p>
<p>五是否應與各國共同組織一「世界親善會」、專爲促進國際間之友好事宜、</p>
<p>東南女體專之表演</p>
<p>南京光華攝</p>
<p>（二）我國以三民主義建國、今雖已至訓政時期、然西方人士與我表同情者尙屬少數、其故蓋在國人向外宣傳不努力、又關於黨義書籍全爲中文、外人不能閱讀、余於此不能不希望我國敎育當局速將商務印書館出版之「英文三民主義」（Ｓａｎ　Ｍｉｎ　Ｃｈｕ　Ｉ）即畢範字（Ｆ·Ｗ·Ｐｒｉｃｅ）氏與何炳松先生所譯者、贈送各國政府、敎育機關（如各國敎育行政機關·大學圖書館等）及敎育專家等若干册、使西方人士不諳中文者、亦得知孫中山先生所創之主義、而與我表同情、</p>
<p>（三）外人現在對於我國消息、旣屬隔膜、（僅知我有軍事活動而已）故希望我國、敎育當局將此次全國敎育會議議决案、譯成英文或他國文字後、除贈送各國敎育機關及敎育專家等若干本外、並於下届世界敎育會議開會時、我國代表須帶去在議塲中宣讀、冀求三民主義敎育之普及於世界、與「世界大同」主張之實現、</p>
<p>敎育界諸領袖乎、其亦以一得之愚爲可採否乎、</p>

<h3>米商操縱洋米</h3>
<p>▲社會局禁做期貨</p>
<p>近日洋米市價、仍在繼長增高、其原因有爲局外人所未悉者、爰將調查所得、詳誌於下、以供留心民食者之注意、</p>
<p>▲洋米期貨買賣　本埠華商雜糧油餅交易所、本擬於今春起、開拍洋米期貨、後因未得工商部批准、乃改在雜糧公會議市、其形式上雖無拍板情事、實則雙方買賣、宛如新開之洋米交易所、社會局初未注意、任其自由營業、遂致一般商人、挾其偉大之經濟勢力、大買特買、譬如買洋米百噸、祇須預付保證金一千兩、越數月米價高漲、即行割去、計可凈餘一千兩、故業外人亦莫不認爲發財㨗徑、再見飛漲不已、則趁早購進、作爲囤積、待價而沽、有以低價購進之貨、已認爲心滿意足、絡續了結、已可致富、數月來、華人均做多頭、賣方盡爲洋商、因華商購買力强大、價格步步上漲、但公會市場、洋米期貨買賣、並不因價高而减色、但一客買户用途、全係囤積性質、並非眞實銷路、米市爲買空關係、竟至飛皇騰達、頭號本米、最高價曾達二十二元、因此平民叫苦、而投機米商、則大獲其利矣、</p>
<p>▲社會局之禁令　茲聞社會局查悉雜糧公會、確有操欵壟斷洋米市面之嫌欵、特於昨日、今該公會即日起停做期貨新買賣、茲錄令文如下、爲令遵事、查近來洋米市價、仍在繼長增高、影響平民生計、殊非淺鮮、業由本局長面囑平價委員會商整會代表葉惠鈞君、轉告各該同業暫停洋米期貨轉賣、以免紊亂市面、合亟令仰該公會、切實誥誡同業遵辦、不得再有期貨洋米轉賣情事、致干嚴懲、并須設法平準市價、以维民食、仰即將遵辦情形具報候核、是爲至要、此令、云云、一般素依洋米爲生之商人、聞此莫不憂形於色、惟該公會三樓洋米現貨、當然照常交易、關於期貨買賣、聞暗中仍在續做、不過爲數較小、至現貨市面、已因此帶疲矣</p>

<h3>浙江第一批移民明日出關</h3>
<p>▲計八百餘人</p>
<p>浙江移民赴東北開墾荒地　經省政府派員來滬、與各輪公司商定輪送辦法、第一批移民出關、原定本月底送到遼寗、先有三百餘名到滬、此事已屢誌本報、茲將續聞種種分誌如下、</p>
<p>▲廣利赴溫運載　此次浙省往東北移民、以浙東温州·臨海·永嘉等縣居多、近據各縣報到者、多在温州取齊、現已陸續到達、昨日滬上承辦此事之上海市政府委員周柏桐君、已接得温州電告、謂移民到全、囑即派輪往載、周氏即與招商局磋商、經該局營業科轉電由粵回滬之廣利輪、於今日兼灣温州、載運該批移民至上海、約計明日可以抵申、</p>
<p>▲首批同關名額　浙政府初定首批移送一千五百名、故招商本擬專派一船到温州、直接裝送到營口上陸、茲據電告、各縣報到之數、照原定之額、僅有十分之六、除已來之三百餘人外、明日從温州續運至滬者、僅五百名左右、兩共合計、祇八百餘名出關、預計本月二十七日可到營口、浙省府已經電達遼寗省政府、請届時派員照料矣、</p>
<p>▲移民明日離滬　招商局派定載送該移民赴營口之華陽輪、原定今日開出、昨因廣利輪所載之五百餘人、本日不及來滬、遂展遲一天結關、在滬守候、准於二十三日、過載各移民上船後、即和地直放營口、此次招商局承載移民赴遼、因浙省府之經濟支絀、對於移民乘船、船票槪行免費、祇收各人之火食費一部、另外請浙省府、酌貼輪船之煤費一部、此事已經商妥照辦矣、</p>

<p>▲四綁匪忿怒放槍　四綁匪預知湯必於此時出門、故假裝行人、徘徊弄口、斯時見潘洪才來言、東家已至、匪等早已劍拔弩張、準備綁架、旣見車夫陸永林撥機欲遁、自思一塊肥肉、行將上嘴、豈具輕易放過、遂於千鈞一髮之際、均各兇眉怒目、袖出手槍、二匪用槍監視湯之行動、并標其聲張、二匪則對準陸之腦部射來、陸見彈無情、立時將頭低垂、彈從頭上飛過、幸未命中、然有一匪見子彈被其避去、亦即開放一槍、正射陸之左肩、彈穿背部、</p>

<h3>海上聞琴記</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>僻居淞湄。如逃空虚。難得一二素心人。相與傾談今古。以解窮悉。忽錢子化佛折柬邀與覺林之筵。謂已約得琴友畫侶佛家若干輩。爲一夕之歡。予聞之忻然而往。化佛有南游。謁釋迦侔尼之墓之壯舉。種種計畫。爲述綦詳。旣而張聿光。王陶民。袁希濓。趙蘭亭諸先生翩然蒞止。相與入席。淸蔬數品。自饒眞味。希濓爲法學家。然邇來躭於禪悅。所談多佛家語。謂吾人入世出世。各有因緣。惟宜處處不忘菩提心。斯爲善耳。洵屬名言。化佛｀出一扇形册子。有荀慧生之山水。梅蘭亭之花卉。山水墨韻酣足。花奔爲十姊妹。設色嫵媚。尤爲佳構。陶氏固名畫家。因論及古人之設色。有輕重之分。輕者娟逸。重者沉著。往往有正面設色。而再染之於反面以襯托者。有旣色而拂去。重設再三以見其厚者。今人無此功夫也。陶民又撫琴。據云。琴非百年前物不可彈。蓋其音澀悶。不若舊者之瞭亮也。漆易坼裂。以梅花斷爲最。蛇腹斷次之。牛毛斷又次之。惜此調不彈已久。有朱絃塵封之槪。緩當理之。雖不甘自居伯牙。還當屈諸子爲種子期也。蘭亭聆之。忽躍然曰。我有琴友林素園者。閩中人也。性好游。笠屐南北。輒以焦桐自隨。茲來滬寓大中華飯店。左鄰舞塲。蠻樂琤瑽作繁響。而君閉户蕭然。撫琴自遣。忘其身在軟紅十丈中。眞高土也。盍往訪之。饜飫之餘。聿光陶民尙有别約。怱怱即去。吾儕乃同趨西藏路。希濓曰。諺有對牛彈琴之語。吾儕不解音律。其爲牛乎。相與大笑。旣至。則癯貎秀髯者。林君素園也。案横一琴。方事拂拭。紹介寒喧畢。視其琴。古氣盎然。乃朱明故物。鐫有銘云。作于古。修於今。復以見天地之心。請之奏。君謙抑者再。始爲操歸去來二折。其音細如蟲之咽泣。遠如水之紆餘。急如夏雨之驟至而颯然生風也。凝神以聽。雜慮俱蠲。所以昔人有琴者禁也之說。洵非虚謬。琴聲止而餘韻猶若撩繞於指間。使人悠然起遐想。時已子夜。遂辭别而歸。記之以爲鴻爪。</p>
<h3>貓撳電鈴之奇聞</h3>
<p>— 淺</p>
<p>去余家數十武。爲同學劉君住宅。劉君有愛貓癖。畜貓三十餘頭。日耗魚腥無算。中有玳貓二。係姊示行。最婉變可人意。劉君伉儷。愛之若掌上珠。不但寢食與俱。具嚴戒僕媼。不得稍傷毫髮。曾有一僕。因誤觸貓耳。爲劉君所斥。一時傳爲笑話。</p>
<p>去歲臘月中。此玳瑁貓之一。名「金絲」者。忽杳如黃鶴。劉君四出偵尋。終不能得。爲之懊喪。而玳瑁貓之二。名「銀絲」者。因其姊失踪。驟失伴侶。致悲鳴終日。不肯進食。劉君見之。益覺踧踖不寗。</p>
<p>有告以尋貓秘法。並自矜至爲靈騐。劉君明知爲迷信舉動。以愛貓故。姑依法試之。法以水碗一隻。置竈上。滿盛淸水。並以秤桿一枝。連秤錘秤鈎。架碗口上。别無他異。劉君照辦後。事閱月餘。卒無踪影。遂淡然忘之。</p>
<p>前日。時在深夜。劉君伉儷。正擁衾高臥。忽聞電鈐聲大作。震耳欲聾。劉君因之驚醒。念在此夜闌人靜。胡來不速之客。殆盜匪之流。不覺不寒而慄。正躊躇間。電鈴聲又大作。且雜以貓鳴。聲至熟諗。劉君乃披衣而起。至門畔。一視究竟。詎門方啓。鈐聲又作。而人踪杳然。寒風拂拂。吹火欲滅。劉君見門外闃無一人。幾驚極而呼。</p>
<p>此時貓之悲鳴。又斷斷續續。作於咫尺之間。劉君尋聲凝視之。則瞥見失去之愛貓「金絲」。正高伏門際。舉爪撳鈴。狀頗滑稽。劉君大喜。捧貓於懷。閉門歸室。告夫人曰。金絲歸矣。金絲歸矣。夫人亦歡忭逾恒。與金絲接一甜蜜之吻。</p>
<p>一昨。余値劉君於途。劉君欣然告余失貓復得事。余笑曰。金絲不攀屋而入。竟異想天開。撳鈴作祟。君不咎其擾人淸夢之罪。而反引爲笑樂。愛之更摯。殆亦狸奴轉世歟。劉君頷首大笑。</p>
<p>金絲安然歸來。余亦受惠不淺。蓋余家畜鴿數十。爲野貓垂涎。金絲曁其妹銀絲。時來巡護。去歲曾在余家花園中。與二野貓作殊死戰。雖頸部微傷。卒將二貓打退。余鴿得以倖免云。</p>
<h3>大上提燈記</h3>
<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>國慶紀念。革命紀念。各地之開慶祝會也。恒有提燈之舉。提燈會常行於夜間。燈火萬千。舉國歡騰。吾人每於各地見之。但提燈之游行。從未聞能有在空中者。今將吾友趙君啓昌空中提燈之事。紀之以證吾說。</p>
<p>春光駘蕩。萬奔爭妍。當此艷陽天氣。兒童好弄。爭放風箏。公輸子作森鳶。韻事流傳。此種玩物。已流行至數千年之久。友人趙君啓昌。性亦愛之。每至春二三月。鈎心鬥角。製爲種種蟲魚鳥獸之形。放於天空。日前異想天開。用玻璃紙糊成燈籠數十。每個以綫連之。另用乾電筒嵌於其内。入夜。電筒捩明。數十燈籠。携於郊外而放之。飆風一陣。皆乘風而上。此時每個燈籠。相離咫尺。玻璃紙外。電炬通明。夭矯天空。頓成長蛇之陣。驟視之。踵接前行。與地上提燈會之遊行無異。秩序井然。且或過之。此誠風箏潮中異想天開之新玩法也。世有風箏癖者。曷一倣行之。</p>
<h3>西人產析記</h3>
<p>— 絜廬</p>
<p>海上某洋行主人。英吉利人也。五十餘年前。隻身來滬上。以微資經營地產。奮鬭數十年。積忺至三千數百萬。雖猶不及哈同之富。其眼光之銳敏。經營之成功。洵足與哈同媲美矣。初雅片戰爭以後。中外互市。夷場十里。　露藍樓。固無有今日之繁庶。主人擅計然殖產之道。以賤値貨得沮洳荒蕪之田。經之營之。至今俱爲海上繁華之區。畝値數十萬金。宜夫面團團爲富家翁焉。然主人有奇癖。擁海上極巨之地產。而己則賃數椽以居。出入亦無汽車。有時每步當車。宴如也。磋夫。海上人士。摩托飛駛。一若莫不富有者。實則古人所謂「車澤人瘁。」比比皆是。以視主人。得毋媿死。然則主人之儉嗇如是。得毋成守錢奴乎。則又不然。主人自知年邁。乃立遺囑。斥其半助入敎育事業。吾華人久服務其洋行中者。亦皆分得數萬金不等。可謂豪已。嗟夫。遺產之毒。國人中之最深。今日兄弟姊妹因爭產而興訟者甚衆。豈匪遺產制之流毒歟。安得以某西人模範之。鳴呼。可以風巳。</p>
<h3>南洋游記（十五）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>二十日晨即到新嘉坡。但到坡頗非易事。須二條件。一爲騐護照。二爲騐疫。遇一切碼頭。此二條爲鐵律也。夫到坡前。先經停泊以待潮。潮至乃入港。英人之騐護照。較法人爲自由。英殖民地。所以能成功於海上者。有寬大自由之號也。英人一騐即蓋戳而已。法人則經許多時間。寫許多字據。徒形容其狹小苛刻耳。此外則騐病醫生權甚大。只有一小輪開來騐疫。騐疫船上懸。一黃旗。此旗不下落。商船不許進口。須看此旗下落。客船乃得自由入港也。吾不能不認西人動輒藉口衛生。似視生命頗重。奈何其十天以内。歐洲立可調動員兩千萬人以互殺。其命又何賤耶。眞顚倒矣。於此有應知者。坐法郵船本甚淸潔。余等但見騐疫船來。未見其騐客人之疫。若英船在四等以下者。聞須脫衣檢身。有疫者則不能登岸。另有一小島。安置彼處。以琉璜薰衣。有米須自採柴而燒飯。經過一七二七之後。病愈方許入口云。吾常爲人言。天下事多難解。如盧信君所著不澈底原理。今歐美爲富人政治。故貧即是罪惡。貧人身上即是疫蟲之所。其實貧人身體。反較富人强健者。如癆症傳染。乃富人爲多。涉在俄國。則適得其反。彼乃窮人政治。富人便是罪惡也。日近長安遠。吾人安能斷定其是非乎。不過若以吾中國中和文化。平心衡之。則均失其平。罪惡自是罪惡。不應從貧富上判斷。鳴呼。吾爲此發憤。所以决心與東方新文化以救濟全球也。世人遠識之士能助余乎。</p>
<p>到岸有南洋大酒店接客者。彼即呌一汽車。將行李直至該店。其接客極有本領。操各方言。在碼頭有印度人來索錢。彼不與一文。亦未受檢查。駕車直到店。店中共算三元二角。若自己與碼頭人交涉。則費不貲也。</p>
<p>余住一房。每日三元。飯不在内。寬大淸潔矣。此間三元。合上海五元。</p>
<p>下午往訪佛敎會陳麗墀。王止菴君乃知王於月前已死。其爲佛敎上重要人物。余曾接其一信。甚懇摯。今竟死矣。陳君即導余訪天福宮方丈轉道老和尙留宿該寺。</p>
<p>二十一晨。道師囑陳君接余住龍山寺花園樓上。其棧房之費。均由陳君支付。此間佛會人。且怨我不早打電來。使彼等預備歡迎也。</p>

<h3>糧食　米市依然呆滯</h3>
<p>▲閘北　昨日各帮到十餘號、市銷呆定、常錫白粳、趨勢益形为振、頂粳米尙在二十元關内外、未見升降、市高粳則續有修削、中次節節批降、各貨在評價上喝短近角之譜、惟店胃貪進者似覺穏立、大部份約有半角出入、粳米在目前殊無回好之望、薄稻到銷兩滯、行情仍疲、而頂貨尙可在十九元關外也、羊秈買户不弱、奈來貨凋零如故、交易因仍式微、杜尖亦然、大盤悉覺堅定、白元呆而欠佳、市價與前日相彷、</p>
<p>▲滬南　河下到船續稀、北粳高貨少、中次爲主、本街銷路、始終平庸、價格明定暗疲、蘇同機粳雖因貨薄崦而微緊、然買客亦無暢進之胃、祇少數零拆交易而已、盤面在十八元左右、南路角里·泗涇等稻、一律呆定、且寗胃甚微、市難向榮、羊秈·杜子秈竟不旺到、而南路貨去路亦不俏式、行情尙屬堅穏、變元陰化滯而交少、步趨下游、</p>
<h3>黃荳期疲現定</h3>
<p>昨日近期連豆殊不振、大連產電雖平、然本月份因買方陸續脫售了結而見疲、至於賣方、因現銷欠暢而備解、故標準回至五兩三錢七分、須小去三四分、而現豆則仍告平定、高貨須四錢左右、中關則開三錢六七分、市銷以本街小磨爲主、内地帮因不划觀望、刻下荳市已呈呆懈之象</p>
<h3>期洋米價高銷滯</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况、由漲轉定、因在前日午後繼續鋒漲角外後、各帮均停頓不辦、故昨日上午極形疲滯、但行情跌小後、怱引起溫州帮與本街及平糶去路、統市開出二萬以上、市面乃得站定、售開一號西貢十五元九角、二號十五元、小絞十五元二角、大絞敏黨均十五元一角、比前日最高價、小去角許、期洋米產地報漲、洋行擯守、回籠貨喊價甚高、但恐市面擾亂、大都觀望不出、故統市極少成交云、</p>
<h3>天晴粉市轉跌</h3>
<p>昨日麵粉各月份市面、均一致疲落、因日來天氣逐步良好、前以兩故、人心望高、而日來内地帮、以麥苗之滋長、甚形順遂、蓋以氣候適合、於麥之發育、極將其宜、若此種景象、未有急遽之變化、未來之麥收、當有豐收之望、人心之轉軟、或即根據於此也、旋以津帮對近遠期均有一部份回出、諒以新粉到此檔口、認爲過昂、故隨人心不振之時、從事抛賣、實銷帮之觀察如是、不知熱中之内地帮、曾否感動也、結果本月份較前週小五厘、五月份小一分二厘半、六月份小一分半、七月份小一分二厘半、八月份小一分、九月份小五厘云、</p>
<h3>期麥近跌遠平</h3>
<p>昨日期麥各月份市面、呈近跌遠平之象、本月份因多頭回出、廠方未動、兼之交割已將接近、浮多均趁勢出檔、至存底而言、因靑黃時節、到源反未湧旺、投機之未敢居爲奇貨、此爲最大之主因也、六月份以天色甚佳、麥苗均報秀發、因此人心略軟、七八九月份、一部分之無錫帮、曾有少數回出、然另一部分、仍有吸進、故呈互擯之象、觀此後之天氣不變、恐將逐步軟弱矣、結果本月份較前週小四分、六月份小二分、七月份小一分、八月份大一分、九月份不動、現麥市面、高貨因廠胃甚健、價尙平穏、中次則呈低疲之象、開淸江浦宿州徐州蚌埠等麥五兩一錢、沙市麥四兩七錢半、共開一萬八千包、由福新辦一萬四千包、阜豐辦四千包云、</p>

<h3>公園裏的碎響　·時·鐸</h3>
<p>吃過午飯後、便怱怱踏出寓所、走向Ｊｅｓｓ　Ｆｉｅｌｄ　Ｐａｒｋ裏去、在途中、我就忖量着如何在那着消度這春風沉醉的午晌、打算進了園門後、就先繞園週遊一圈、然後揀着很寂靜的一角、在綠葉環繞中、靜靜的坐下來、細心閱讀一本葇盾著的虹、高興的話、就不回去吃晚飯也好、在那裏等着月亮升上來、好將不堪回首的往事、在淸和的夜氣中、細細的回憶、我想到這裏、就有一股輕鬆的感覺通過我的胸膛、似乎呼吸也暢快多了、</p>
<p>走到了園門、迎面來了一位園警、我本能地往裏袋搜索、預備將Ｓｅａｓｏｎ　Ｔｉｃｋｅｔ拿出來給他檢騐、那知滿身都搜遍了却依然搜不着、這纔把我記起自己的一張門票是放在另一件衣袋内、不曾帶來、我懊喪着臉紅了一陣又一陣、只好掏出二角錢來、回頭走到賣票處去、「眞倒霉多出這寃枉的錢、」當着我把門票接到手時、我暗暗的這樣想着、</p>
<p>一進園門、前面的一簇叢林、就與我心靈上的一種壓迫、當我走到牠的底下、竟爾悽然小立許久、左顧右盼、好像此地於我是很生疏的、實則不然、當我小立時、就有一種特異的感覺憑空襲來、我覺得這裏的一葉一木、都非常可愛、還有那枝頭跳躍着的鳥兒、從葉𨻶裏漏出一片嬌嫩的唱聲、更令我陶然沉醉、半晌、我纔戀戀不捨地走過、</p>
<p>一忽兒、我從園角穿出、走到園中特有的一度石橋、見着一羣人靠着橋攔、正在津津有味的俯視橋下、大家的視線、都集中在一隻翻斛斗的老鼠身上笑聲和銅鑼聲混成一片、我不經意的從這裏走過、踏前約有十幾步、園中心的熱閙的情况就開展在我的眼前、小的老的高的矮的紅的綠的、往來交錯着、凑成一幅繁榮底春的圖畫、當下我就覺得這園裏異樣了、往日給孤寂幽靜鎖住的境况、而今是只能在記憶上去找了、我這樣想着、就走到了位在園中部的一泓湖水旁邊、這時湖畔立着七八個外籍小孩、露着膝、衫袖捲得高高的、在那裏玩弄他們的小帆船、岸上站着看熱鬧的人、也一堆一堆的擁擠着、似乎他們來此的目的、就是爲看這把戲似的、</p>
<p>我由此復往園角裏鑽、在綠蔭庇護之下、我一步一頓的徐徐走着、春風徐徐吹來、驅散了我身上的悶氣、我感着幾分快意、想就近找一個舒適的坐位、靜靜的坐下來看書、然而、環顧左右、所有的坐位都給㨗足者佔據了、我失望着、只好依舊向前走去、走不上十幾步、便可以從綠叢的間𨻶處、隠隠窺見幾部汽車在園外停着、同時汽車的嗚聲、也接二連三的頻頻傳來、原來前面就是東首的大門了、此時游客如潮湧般的從大門進來、一個一個的都兜着勁兒、飛快的往園中走去、</p>
<p>我站在樹下惘然望着、心裏忽然陰暗起來了、這一簇閑情逸致的人物、只給我一種窒息的悲感、我覺到了人生灰色的一面、我也覺到了人生榮華的一角、呵、人生可詛咒的都市的人生、我源源地噓了口悶氣、隨轉身往西走、猛覺眼前襲來一道霞光、原來西邊樹梢高頭已經掛着一輪火球似的落日、將園裏的一切景物都染成絳赤了、</p>
<p>在園裏亂跑了一回、仍是脫不了一種莫名其妙的積悶、那挽着手的戀人、那魅人的軟笑、那樸索的嘈雜、這些一切、都能使我慊惡、最後我走到園角叢林間坐下、滿擬從此靜靜的歇息一趟、然而、坐不上幾秒鐘、那充滿了全空間的嗡嗡然的碎響、已把我驅到園外去了、</p>
<h3>神秘的東島　·梁·雄·萬</h3>
<p>美國賓夕法尼亞大學的科學家共十二人、將於明春出發東島、一塊南太平洋中最神秘的地方、此行或能將二百年來科學家對這荒島、所認爲神秘莫解處、加以圓滿的解决、</p>
<p>這個荒島的面積旣是很小、所以土人之住在該處者、也就不多、沿着這曲折岸邊、排列着無數墓碑、那是早給人忘記的民族的遺物呵、現在没有人知道這些墓碑、是那一種民族築的、或是那一個時代的建築物、</p>
<p>東島是一三角式的火山地、面積祇有四十五平方哩、他的隣島（約距似連Ｃｈｉｌｅａｎ岸二千哩、西距東島一千哩）是地球上荒蕪僻遠、絶無人烟的地方、</p>
<p>東島距運輸的航路、很是僻遠、所以在一九二二年的時候、一艘西班牙探險船尋覓失敗、同年這島發生過一次地震後、費了好幾個月才能改正船主的報告｜｜死人島已失見了、祇有幾個探險家到過那裏、他們在那處發見的東西、是世界上最有趣味而還未解决的神秘之一種、</p>
<p>最有趣味的是巍大的古墓、共有二百六十座、其中有長三百呎、高一五呎者前面有一百呎寬的祭壇、備人們祭祀祖先之用、島中共有六百餘高大的半身石像、現在還没有人尋出這些石像到底是那一個人從火山石刻出來的、或者他們爲什麽要這樣刻的、</p>
<p>這種面貎嚴肅的石像　（最大的是三十呎高、四十噸至二百五十噸重）的位置、不是固定的、聽說這許多石像用作墳墓的裝飾品、墓下有卵形石片襯托着、百五十年前、有一漁人到過那裏、他看見沿岸都立着無數的石偶、背向着海裏、他就奇怪起來、對這些東西感着不少的趣味、</p>
<p>這些奇形怪狀的石隅、總在二千年至五千年以上、可能的、他們的年齡還可以高一點、他們是否是偶像、供人們拜禱的神像、或是古代英雄豪傑的像、或是祖先的像、對於這些問題還没有圓滿的答覆、</p>
<p>島中共有火山口三處、火山口旁的巖石、是早給人家忘記的民族所用來刻石偶的原料、在拉拉苦火山口旁、還有許多未完工的石偶放在該處、但我們這裏有點懷擬、在上古時代或是中古時代、機器旣没有發明、石匠們是到底用甚麽方法、將這已成的石偶、從火山口搬到山下來呢、這是我們所不解之處、現在山坡和火山口旁、有許多粗重的器具被我們發見了、這顯然是幾百年前工人們的遺物、而且在火山口旁的石像、大半未曾完工、這更可以顯得出當時的工作、一定爲某種魔力所停止了、</p>
<p>這惡魔是不是戰爭·疫癘·饑饉·還是一塲特殊的天災、將這般工人一齊掃盡呢、没有人知道這些事情、雖則是揣測之說紛起、有人說這是地震和火山爆發所使然、但他不能拿出地理上的證據、去確定他的說數、假若地震眞要發生、火山眞要爆發、那石像和祭壇等遺物、一定老早化爲碎片、即不碎裂、就會爲火山鎔石覆没了、</p>
<p>爲的是要打破東島的種種神秘、賓夕法尼亞大學這次的探險、就須費長時</p>
<p>間去預備一切、一艘値一百五十萬美金的特製的馬達船、將於最近的將來完成、以作這次探險之用、船已定名「加路連」、計長二百五十呎、係愛爾迭約翰生所捐助的、他是賓夕法尼亞大學的校董、同時又是維多留聲機公司的經理、他將和探險隊同船出發東島、</p>
<p>這次探險隊所負最重要的使命、是要解决東島土人的本源、這些島中的民族從那處來的、他們怎樣會到這荒僻島去呢、他們是不是從南美洲的「智利」或「　　張　善　孖　畫　虎　圖</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>秘　」移居於此、　是從　阿摩　島　居於地呢、</p>
<p>現有二百不　的夏威夷人住在島上、他們對於他們自己祖鄕的神秘墓地、不大懂得的、而且也不去關心它、他們也許是這島嶼的原始居民的遺族、但我們不能確實地這樣說、因爲他們没有傳統的文化給我們參考呀、此次探險隊一定對我們有很多的貢獻、請拭着眼兒去等候它吧、</p>

<h3>Liu Ruiheng and Others Were Sworn in Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Health Minister Liu Ruiheng, Acting Minister of Judicial Administration Zhu Lühe, and Capital Police Commissioner Wu Siyu held their swearing-in ceremony on the morning of the 21st after the National Government Memorial Week. Those present included Chiang Kai-shek, Tan Yankai, Wang Chonghui, Gu Yingfen, Zhu Peide, Chen Yi, Yang Jie, Lin Xiang, Jiang Menglin, Wang Zhengting, Zhang Wohua, Li Jinlun, Wei Daoming, Enhe Batu, Shao Yuanchong, Jiao Yitang, and over three hundred staff members from the two offices of the National Government and representatives from various agencies. After Chairman Chiang finished the ceremony, he first held the ceremony of conferring the seals, with Chiang Kai-shek conferring the seals to Liu Ruiheng, Zhu Lühe, and Wu Siyu, respectively. Then, the oath of office was taken, with Wang Chonghui representing the central government as the oath supervisor. After the oath, Wang Chonghui delivered an instructive speech, roughly saying, "An ancient saying goes, 'Prevention beforehand is better than remedy afterward.'" The Ministry of Health should prevent epidemics in advance. Comrade Liu has profound research in the field of health, and in the future, he will surely work hard to develop health undertakings to live up to the government's expectations. Judicial administration must be able to reduce the number of criminals, without waiting until after the crime to seek remedies. Comrade Zhu has served in the judiciary for many years and will surely work hard. Comrade Wu, as police commissioner, must prevent local security incidents in advance to consolidate the security of the capital. Although the duties of the three are different, I believe their spirit is the same. Next, Chairman Chiang delivered an instructive speech, roughly saying, I have a word I want to tell you all, that the problem with Chinese politics is using useless people. Therefore, to rectify everything in the future, we must start by not using useless people. I hope the three of you pay attention to this point. Finally, Liu, Zhu, and Wu replied separately, and the meeting adjourned with music. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) A telegram from Beiping on the 20th stated: (1) The people of Shaanxi, Gansu, Han, and Hui are deeply concerned that Feng Yuxiang's troops will harass the local area, so they have united with local bandits and militias to clash with Gao Shuxun's troops stationed there from time to time. (2) Gao Shuxun, under Feng Yuxiang, telegraphed Feng Yuxiang, saying that bandits are rising everywhere in Shaanxi and Gansu, making it difficult to control the situation. Our troops are greatly inconvenienced in their movements, and we lack both food and pay. If no measures are taken to maintain the situation, there is really no way to cope. (3) Chen and Wang have all arrived in Zhengzhou and once visited Lu Zhonglin to ask him to first telegraph Feng Yuxiang in advance to prepare for their arrival. According to a certain staff officer of Lu Zhonglin, Lu said that they only saw destruction but not construction, only paying attention to extravagance but not contributing to the situation. He advised Feng to take Yan as a warning. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Opening of the Japanese Diet</h3>
<p>Under the parliamentary system, it is unheard of to have no disputes. However, to be able to consider the overall national situation amidst disputes and not stubbornly adhere to personal opinions is commendable. The cooperation between the British Liberal Party and the Labour Party to avoid the dangers of the naval conference and the German Right-wing Party supporting the government party to avoid chaos are valuable examples of political parties. Other parties often refuse to sacrifice their prejudices, with the government party focusing on suppressing the opposition party to prevent them from expressing their views, and the opposition party focusing on attacking the government party to achieve their goal of overthrowing them. This is why the political situation is often turbulent and unstable.</p>
<p>Since the general election in Japan, the various accumulated difficult problems will be released in today's meeting, such as the arms reduction agreement, the aftermath of the gold standard, compulsory education, rural countermeasures, worker unemployment, and other problems that are difficult to solve. In addition, the unprecedented large-scale strike of Tokyo electricity workers has dealt a major blow to the government. Moreover, besides the Seiyukai party, which is opposed to the government party, there are also members of the nobility, military, and proletarian factions with conflicting political views watching from behind. Therefore, some say that this meeting is a major challenge for the Japanese government. However, I believe whether this challenge becomes a real obstacle depends on the intentions and methods of both sides. If the government and the party cannot broaden their horizons and still want to rely on the power of the majority party to suppress everything in order to monopolize important positions such as the speaker and deputy speaker, expand their authority as a tool for victory, and strictly limit the time of the meeting to prevent the opposition party from speaking, then they will only further provoke the opposition party. Even if today's meeting manages to avoid a breakdown, there will be many crises in the future. This is the worst of the worst strategies. If the opposition government party cannot act with integrity, consider the national welfare and people's livelihood, correct the government's errors, and find ways to alleviate the difficulties of the environment to appease the people, but instead take advantage of opportunities to seek revenge, attack the government, and restore their previous power as their sole purpose, then they may not be able to achieve their goals. Even if the power is returned to their hands, how can it benefit the country? This is also a major miscalculation. Therefore, I believe that the future of the Japanese political situation does not lie in the difficulty of today's problems but in whether both sides can realize</p>

<h3>Wang Zhengting Reports on the Process of Signing the Weihai Treaty</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 21st, during the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Memorial Week, Wang Zhengting reported on the signing of the agreement with the British envoy last Friday to recover the Weihaiwei leased territory. The full text will be announced after agreeing on a publication date with the British envoy. This move can wash away a portion of the humiliation. We still hope to recover other lost sovereign rights one by one in the shortest possible time. The foreign policy established by the National Government two years ago: (1) The issue of tariff autonomy: eleven countries have already signed treaties one after another, and the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement has also been completed recently and will be formally signed soon, which can be considered the end of a stage. (2) The issue of restoring legal rights: can also be concluded in the shortest possible time. (3) The issue of returning concessions and leased territories: This time, the United Kingdom has implemented the proposals of the Washington Conference and resolutely returned Weihaiwei, which can serve as a good start. Although draft agreements were made in 1924 and 1925, it was not until today that they could be signed. The crux of the matter was the issue of borrowing a portion of the houses on Liugong Island for British sailors to live in during the summer for a period of ten years, but the period could be extended, and the Chinese government stated that it could not refuse without reason. I think this is inappropriate and believe that there is no need to sign such a contract. Following a five-year period, no consensus was reached, which is a shortcoming. However, although the period is ten years, the right to continue the loan is entirely in our hands, which is far different from the previously proposed draft agreement. Returning Weihaiwei is one thing, and borrowing houses is another, and the two should not be confused. This negotiation will discuss everything separately. The signed agreement is for an unconditional return, including all equipment built by the British government, such as water lines, electrical wires, electrical lights, land houses, and water buoys. It is found that a part of Weihaiwei was originally a market and a part was a military port. After this agreement is signed, it not only means that sovereignty can be recovered, but it can also be said that our country has a good military port. Because both parties have agreed that our country can completely convert it into a military port at any time. At that time, all foreign merchants will have to move. I sincerely hope that our country's navy will work hard to reorganize and increase tonnage to take advantage of this good military port, and I also hope that other leased territories will also be actively recovered. At the same time, the issue of recovering concessions is also considered the most important work of this ministry this year. I hope that colleagues will work hard in this spirit to complete the victory of the national revolution diplomacy. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>▲Domei, Tokyo, 21st: The extraordinary session of the Parliament following the second round of general elections will convene on the 21st.

The House of Peers also convened its consultative body. In the House of Representatives, the Minseito, the ruling party, holds an overwhelming majority with 271 members, decisively overpowering the Seiyukai with 173 members. However, the financial turmoil after the lifting of the gold embargo, issues of disciplinary rectification, naval disarmament, etc., do not allow the ruling party to be optimistic. In particular, the unprecedented strike by tens of thousands of Tokyo transportation workers seems poised to become a matter of the authorities' responsibility.

They will do their utmost to help the Indian people realize their aspirations whenever the opportunity arises.

Although 2,700 temporary car operators mobilized in an emergency continued to operate trams and city buses yesterday, tram revenue was halved, while bus revenue saw only a slight increase. The most prosperous were the subway and various company buses, especially in the Asakusa area, where city buses stopped work earlier, resulting in extreme crowding. The strike is expected to continue for several months, and neither side is yielding an inch. The strike group frequently changes its resting places to avoid being appeased by the authorities. No unfortunate incidents have occurred as of yesterday. The Electricity Bureau fired 26 strike leaders, one of whom was indicted while consulting with Yokohama streetcar workers. Three cadres from the Otsuka depot were also indicted for inciting unrest. Although the Metropolitan Police Department is working hard to prevent the strike from becoming violent, Police Commissioner Maruyama has decided to maintain his previous declaration of not mediating. Because many vehicles are stopped, many buses from outside Tokyo are coming to the city to provide support. Trucks were also hastily converted into buses, and approximately 800 permits were issued for these vehicles yesterday.</p>
<p>▲Denstu, Tokyo, 21st: Due to the Tokyo streetcar strike, the temporary car operators who were urgently supplemented are unfamiliar with the recent complex streetcar system, leading to collisions and other accidents occurring one after another. More than 20 people were injured yesterday alone, and temporary conductors also fell and were injured.</p>
<p>▲Denstu, Osaka, 21st: An unstable situation has arisen among Kobe city streetcar workers since yesterday. The cause is the sudden dismissal of a car operator who went to Tokyo to observe the streetcar dispute. Furthermore, there is also a proletarian movement behind the scenes, and the future situation is not optimistic.</p>
<p>▲Denstu, Tokyo, 21st: Various proletarian factions issued a joint declaration last night regarding the streetcar dispute, stating their support for the dispute. A joint struggle committee among the proletarian factions has been established, and the streetcar dispute has become cleverly organized.</p>
<p>▲Denstu, Tokyo, 21st: Ooyama Ikuo, the leader of the Labour-Farmer Party, who is currently touring the Sanin region, was indicted at a rally in Shuji City the other day because his speech touched upon the authorities' taboos. This telegram arrived at the Labour-Farmer Party headquarters tomorrow, just as the party was discussing parliamentary countermeasures regarding the Tokyo streetcar strike, causing great indignation among the party and various proletarian factions. Proletarian members of parliament will severely protest to Interior Minister Adachi in tomorrow's parliament.</p>
<h3>Philippine Storm Uproots Trees and Collapses Houses</h3>
<p>Wind Speed at Fifty Miles Per Hour</p>
<p>Thirteen Towns Transformed into Rubble Fields</p>
<p>▲Associated Press, Manila, 21st: According to today's telegram, the first storm of the season has occurred in Leyte Province, destroying over ninety homes and killing two people. More deaths are feared after transportation is restored. The barracks of the Philippine Constabulary were blown down by the wind, and other houses, both large and small, were either completely collapsed or partially damaged. It is reported that the area of crop destruction is very wide and difficult to determine at the moment. Continued reports indicate that thirteen towns in the province have been turned into rubble fields, and no less than a thousand cocoa trees have been broken by the wind. The storm's speed is estimated at fifty miles per hour. The most severely affected area is the town of Tolosa, where almost no houses are intact. Flooding followed the storm.</p>
<h3>Ukrainian Anti-Government Case</h3>
<p>The Grand Theater Temporarily Converted into a Court</p>
<p>Thirty-Seven Defendants Sentenced to Imprisonment</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Riga, 20th: The Grand Theater in Kharkov was converted into a court today to try forty-five members of the Ukrainian Liberation League who were accused of conspiring to overthrow the Soviet rule in Ukraine. The audience was very large, as the defendants are quite prominent in society. Thirty-seven of the defendants were ultimately sentenced to imprisonment ranging from ten to three years, while the rest were expelled from Ukraine.</p>
<h3>Silver Prices Affect International Trade</h3>
<p>American Silver Producers Association Is Conducting Research</p>
<p>▲Associated Press, Salt Lake City, 20th: Farley, president of the American Silver Producers Association, said today that an international conference will be held by various countries to study the relationship between silver and international trade, especially in China and Mexico. If the price of silver does not have a fixed standard and continues to fluctuate, trade between Europe and the United States with silver-using countries will inevitably be adversely affected. The association has now organized a committee to specialize in research, including the chairman of the British Smelting Company, the chairman of the Anaconda Copper Mining Company, and the vice chairman of the American Smelting and Refining Company, who are all serving as committee members. If China and Mexico request a formal international conference, the committee's research can prepare for further work.</p>
<h3>American Unemployed to Hold Massive Demonstrations on May Day</h3>
<p>Authorities Have Prepared in Advance</p>
<p>▲Associated Press, New York, 20th: Radical leaders said today that the number of unemployed in the United States has been increasing recently, and there are signs of unrest everywhere. It is anticipated that there will be a massive demonstration on May 1st, the largest since the end of the European War. Although the detailed plans for the demonstration are being kept strictly secret, demonstrations in major cities and towns are unavoidable. The purpose of the demonstration will be to first call on the authorities to increase job opportunities, adopt a policy of no overtime in factories, and demand that unemployed people not be evicted from their homes when they are unable to pay rent. It is reported that most of the demonstration groups will express sympathy with Soviet Russia. At the same time, foreign war veterans are determined to investigate the communist movement to see what results can be achieved, in order to emulate it, and have already submitted an application to the authorities to march in groups on May 1st and to hold joint meetings in the union square where unemployed people gather. In view of the fact that conflicts between officials and civilians have occurred in previous weeks due to demonstrations, resulting in tragedies, authorities plan to be extra prepared this time and impose special martial law temporarily in major cities such as New York.</p>

<h3>Commemorative Week of the Central Government and National Government</h3>
<p>▲Central Party Headquarters: At 9 AM on the 21st, the Central Party Headquarters held the 56th Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week in the auditorium. Approximately five or six hundred people attended, including central committee members, officials from various departments and commissions, and guests. Dai Chuanxian chaired the meeting. After the ceremony, the chairman reported, stating briefly that there were several particularly important events recently: (1) The Central Government convened a National Training Conference. (2) The Capital Construction Committee held its first plenary meeting. (3) The Second National Education Conference was convened. (4) The National Games were held in Hangzhou. (5) The National Boy Scout General Review was held. The above matters are all related to the fundamental plans of the party and the nation. I will now highlight their essentials as a contribution, hoping that all comrades will pay attention. (1) The responsibility for training work is extremely important, but in fact, there are various difficulties and it has not been fully carried out. The biggest reason is that the scope specified for the work in the past was too complex and too detailed, making it easy to lose focus and reducing efficiency. The key points decided at this training conference are, on the one hand, to concentrate talent and strength, and on the other hand, for the future work policy, the Central Government will only provide the outlines and use new training methods to unify the will of the nation. The trivial matters will be handled by lower-level agencies in accordance with the circumstances, so that there is room for activity, which will be sufficient to facilitate progress. (2) The capital construction is not a local problem in Nanjing, but an overall national problem. Everyone should have a concept of national construction and bear it together with full force, so that it can be carried out step by step. However, all localities only know about the provinces and cities, and have not paid attention to the nation, so that the construction of the capital has lacked a grand plan for two years. In the future, propaganda should be widely disseminated to promote respect for the capital in all directions, to understand the importance of construction, and to cooperate in its progress. (3) The Second National Education Conference is a major key to improving education in the future. The advantage of the plan set at the First National Education Conference is that the declaration of the conference to implement the Three Principles of the People's Education is in line with modern trends and is not limited by old Confucian prejudices. The disadvantage is that most of the various proposals are empty, and very few practical main measures are specified. This conference is based on the education policies set by the Fourth and Fifth Plenary Sessions of the Second Central Committee and the Third National Congress, and uses the plan of the First National Education Conference as a reference. I believe that most of the participants are famous figures in the education field, and they will certainly be able to make magnificent plans and create a systematic law to open a new era for education and establish a fundamental plan for the country. (4) Regarding the National Games, 21 units of provinces, cities, and overseas Chinese groups participated. The rapid progress of the results is enough to create a new record in the history of Chinese sports. Compared with the results of the World Games, it is still inevitably behind. In the future, we should continue to strive for excellence, so that the next National Games will have even more outstanding achievements. All the referees of this conference were Chinese, and no foreigners participated, and representatives and athletes from all sides were able to obey consistently, which is a good phenomenon. (5) The purpose of holding the Boy Scout General Review is to concentrate the spirit of each group, complete the organization, popularize the training, increase experience, and develop skills. It can also make the people of the whole country pay attention to military and national education, know what to observe and feel, and be determined to revitalize it. It is also a major manifestation of the party's training work. As for the comrades working in the Central Government, I have proposed that the Central Party Headquarters open a sports field and set up a library and club to exercise their bodies, increase their talents, and liven up their spirits. I hope this matter can be realized as soon as possible. The meeting adjourned after the report.</p>
<p>▲National Government: At 10 AM on the same morning, the National Government held the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. Over three hundred people attended, including Chiang Kai-shek, Tan Yankai, Wang Chonghui, Gu Yingfen, Zhu Peide, Wu Siyu, Chen Yi, Yang Jie, Lin Xiang, Wei Daoming, Zhu Luhe, Liu Ruiheng, Wang Zhengting, Zhang Wohua, Li Jinlun, Enhe Batu, Shao Yuanchong, Li Zhonggong, Jiao Yitang, and officials from the National Government's civil and military affairs departments. Chiang Kai-shek chaired the meeting and gave the following political report: "Comrades, there have been no major changes in the military situation in the past week. It is said that Feng Yuxiang arrived in Zhengzhou the day before yesterday. Yan Xishan sent Xu Yongchang and Yang Aiyuan to Zhengzhou to meet with Feng to discuss military plans. It is reported that Yan Xishan has not issued a single cent of the military expenses promised to the various armies for the past month, except for giving Feng Yuxiang 500,000 yuan. Therefore, the various armies will naturally resent Yan's favoritism. However, Yan Xishan still wants them to attack the Central Government. We also hope that they will attack, so that they can throw themselves into the net and the military situation can be quickly concluded. Because if they do not attack, the military situation will be prolonged by one day, which is one more day of suffering for the people. Now we not only have enough defense, but also have preparations to wipe them out in one fell swoop. There are currently no major problems in the Zhengzhou area. As for Laohekou, Junxian, and Yunyang in northern Hubei, all the Northwest Army has been completely wiped out, but the newspapers in Tianjin and Beijing are arbitrarily spreading rumors, saying that Laohekou and other places have been occupied by them. In fact, they are trying to deceive Yan Xishan. They also say that Sun Dianying has contacted the Central Government's Third Division, and that the Third Division has failed. This is completely slander. In fact, the sentries of the two sides are still hundreds of miles apart. They are just exaggerating one more time to ask Yan Xishan for more money. Now the rift between Yan and Feng is growing day by day, and they are deceiving each other. Feng said that the Northwest Army has arrived in Zhengzhou, but in fact, most of them are still in Xi'an, trying to attack Taiyuan. These facts have already clearly told us that Yan and Feng will soon split. As for the reorganizationists and the Western Hills faction being unable to cooperate, that is also what we expected. Now we just need to concentrate on rectifying the interior and wait for them to attack. Regarding the political aspect, our government colleagues feel that they cannot measure whether they are progressing or regressing, but when we look back at what we have done in the past month, we have made progress compared to the past. In terms of the National Movement, the National Games have been held and have achieved very good results. The results of the National Boy Scout Review have also been unprecedented. Now the National Education Conference is being held, and there are more practical proposals being carried out. Such achievements have not been made in a single month since the beginning of the Republic of China. From this, on the one hand, the spirit of the people can be expressed, and on the other hand, it is also political progress. This matter has a huge impact, increasing our spirit several times, which is greater than any power. When foreigners see that the warlords on the other side are acting so recklessly, while we are working so hard on construction, it also shocks them. We can be very gratified in our hearts about this. It can be seen that everything is more organized and orderly than before, and the foundation of the revolution is gradually being consolidated. In terms of diplomacy, there has been much progress recently. The treaty for the recovery of Weihaiwei has been signed. Most countries have signed the autonomous tariff treaty, except for Japan. Now the Japanese Privy Council has passed it, and it should be signed soon. In this light, our hope for tariff autonomy has been completely realized. After this goal is achieved, the national economic foundation will naturally be consolidated, and the national economy will inevitably develop accordingly. Therefore, although the reactionaries are trying their best to slander the Central Government, saying that it cannot abolish the unequal treaties, now it seems that we can abolish the unequal treaties. No matter how the reactionaries spread rumors, they cannot erase the facts. We believe that if all comrades and the people of the whole country work together, and the government can do things step by step, the independence of China can certainly be achieved. Therefore, for the revolution, the rebellion of Yan and Feng has instead increased our infinite strength and courage. We feel very optimistic about the future of the revolution. In addition, there are a few words that I have long wanted to say to you, the newspaper reporters, but I have not had a suitable opportunity. The last time I reviewed the troops in Shanghai, I said to Commander Xiong that regarding the censorship of news, there is no need to delete a paragraph or a word from what is published in the newspapers, as long as they do not publish military actions. Therefore, recently all news has been allowed to be published by the newspapers, so it is inevitable that there will be inaccuracies, especially in what is published in the Shishi Xinbao. Newspapers are originally intended to lead the people and be national teachers, especially for political matters, they must be careful when publishing. Often, the news obtained by reporters has not been verified, and they use it to attack others in the hope of raising their own status. This is not the attitude that newspaper reporters should have. Therefore, many party members are dissatisfied with the attitude of several newspapers in Shanghai recently, because now the people of the whole country clearly recognize the Central Government and the rebels, but the Shanghai newspapers mostly publish news from the north in the front of the newspaper, while news from the Central Government is placed in the back. Who are the rebels, who are the revolutionaries, what is right and wrong, and what is true and false are not distinguished. If the journalistic community is so unclear about right and wrong, what value does it have? How the newspapers publish is absolutely not interfered with by the government, but the news must be accurate. Usually, the opinions of the newspapers do not matter much, but in this critical period, to attack the government for no reason is to be regarded as reactionary speech and speech that aids the rebels. If the journalistic community cannot distinguish between right and wrong, it cannot be free. I hope that newspaper reporters will pay attention. In the future, reporters can freely express their opinions except on military matters, but they must not attack the government with one or two inaccurate words to increase the power of the reactionaries. If they criticize the government, as long as it is factual and justified, that is what they should do; otherwise, they are aiding the rebels. What is the difference between a newspaper that aids the rebels and an army that aids the rebels? I will be going to Wuhan for a review in a few days, and I should be back in Nanjing in about one or two weeks. During this time, I hope that everyone will work harder to make full preparations in all political and economic aspects so that we can resolve the situation with swift means. This is what I deeply hope for."</p>
<h3>Han Fuqu Arrives in Jinan</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Han Fuqu, the General Commander of the First Army Corps, set off north early on the 18th. When he arrived at Mount Tai, he gave a speech to the garrisoned troops there. At 10:00 AM, the armored train "Taian" arrived in Jinan. At 10:30 AM, Han's special train entered the station. Near the station, a company of infantry dispatched by the Jinan Garrison Headquarters was responsible for temporary security. Shandong Chairman Chen Diaoyuan, 20th Army Commander Fan Xiji, Jinan Mayor Zhao Jingshi, and Garrison Commander Shi Zhongcheng, among others, all arrived at the station to welcome him. After Han got off the train and shook hands with the welcoming party, Chen Diaoyuan immediately invited Han to the headquarters of the First General Reserve Army Corps. Accompanying Han were Chief of Staff Li Zongbi and a battalion of guards. (Evening of the 18th)</p>
<h3>Bandits Rampant Near Jiaozhou Bay</h3>
<p>▲ Qingdao Police and Warships Rushed to Suppress Them</p>
<p>▲ Bandits Fled to Jiaojing After Looting Lingshanwei</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The area around Dazhu Mountain and Xiaozhu Mountain near Jiaozhou Bay has long been a den of bandits. Recently, bandit leaders Wang Zicheng and Li Xiaoqi and others have gathered their followers and established strongholds, engaging in robbery from time to time. These bandits have about 500 followers and more than 200 rifles. They are recruiting vagrants and their ambitions are not small. In addition to robbing in Jiaoxian County, Wang Zicheng's gang recently invaded the Qingdao municipal jurisdiction. The Municipal Public Security Bureau reported that Haixi is close to Qingdao and its security is of great importance to Qingdao and Jiaozhou Bay. The Third Branch Bureau Chief Chen was dispatched a few days ago, leading more than 100 police officers and security team members, together with the Haixi garrison police, to take the "Flying Whale" small steamer to suppress the bandits. The Northeast Naval Headquarters also dispatched the warship "Yongxiang" with a detachment of marines to assist in suppressing the bandits south of Dazhu Mountain. Hearing the news, the bandits fled from Xuejiadao (Qingdao City) to Lingshanwei to avoid conflict with the military and police. After arriving in Lingshanwei, they looted the entire town and kidnapped more than 30 people, fleeing northwest. Lingshanwei is a major town in Jiaonan, with developed commerce and a reputation for prosperity. After this tragic robbery, its vitality has been greatly damaged. The Qingdao police and navy, because the bandits had fled the Qingdao municipal jurisdiction, have reorganized and returned to Qingdao. (April 19)</p>
<h3>Jinan City Area Delineated</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Jinan was changed to a city last May when the provincial government moved to Jinan. Regarding the city area issue, the municipal government advocated expansion to protect the city's security. Licheng County, however, believed that the city area was too large, and the county area would inevitably shrink. The county government and various agencies rose up to argue, and several meetings were held in the municipal government without a resolution. Mayor Zhao Jingshi then submitted the reasons for the necessary expansion of the city area to the Department of Civil Affairs for referral to the provincial government for review. The provincial government's standing committee resolved to appoint members such as Yu Enbo to review the matter. The results of the review were reported to the provincial government. Yesterday, the provincial government's 80th committee meeting approved the review plan. The city area is approximately 30 li long in each direction, east, west, north, and south. The boundary lines of its jurisdiction are as follows: (1) The eastern boundary line extends from Xiaojie, passing through Hongjiayuan, Taipingzhuang, Bajianpu, Xianjianzhuang, and Xiheling, to Laoshigou. (2) The southern boundary line extends from Foyulongdong, passing through Daling Xinglongzhuang, and Fenshuiling, to Wenzhuang. (3) The western boundary line extends from Huangshangling, passing through Renjiashankou, Dayangjiazhuang, Yinmazhuang, and Xishawangzhuang, to Luzhuang. (4) The northern boundary line is the Yellow River. (19th)</p>
<h3>Xie Bin's Troops May Be Resolved Peacefully</h3>
<p>▲ Representatives Sent to Apologize and Seek Peace</p>
<p>▲ He Jian Orders Them to Go to Western Hubei</p>
<p>▲ The Disaster of War in Western Hunan Has Been Fortunately Avoided</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Since the assassination of Chen Hanzhang, the commander of the Independent Eighth Brigade, the Li Guojun Regiment of the brigade took the opportunity to mutiny and engaged in war with the Chen Wo Department, the acting Brigade Commander. The newly formed 10th Division, Xie Bin's Department, immediately advanced from Tianzhu, Guizhou, and stationed in Hunan to assist the Li Regiment in attacking the Chen Department. They fought across the river in Qianyang for nine days and nights. Chen Wo's troops were weak and only defended Qianyang City to protect themselves, resulting in the occupation of Hongjiang and a serious situation. He Jian repeatedly telegraphed urging them to leave the province, but Xie and others ignored him. He then decided on a large-scale suppression plan, in addition to telegraphing Mao Guangxiang, Chairman of Guizhou Province, to send Wang Jialie's troops into Hunan to assist in the suppression, he also recalled the Peng Weiren Brigade, and also dispatched a regiment each from Dai Douyuan's Chen Quzhen Department, and He Jian's Li Xuan Regiment, as rebel suppression troops, with Luo Fanying, commander of the 16th Division, as commander. Luo had returned to Changsha from Quanzhou on the 15th, and telegraphed the Peng Brigade and Li Regiment to concentrate in Wugang Baoqing, awaiting orders to advance. Luo himself was scheduled to go to Bao from the province on the 18th to arrange everything. The war clouds in western Hunan momentarily filled the air. Xie Bin, Li Guojun and others were quite alarmed upon hearing this news. Also, because they had been attacking Qianyang for a long time without success, and Mao of Qianyang had sent Deputy Brigade Commander Deng Zhiting to lead the Hou and Liu Regiments to attack them from both sides in Hunan, Chen Wo took the opportunity to counterattack, and Li Guojun suffered heavy losses. Therefore, on the 14th, they abandoned Hongjiang, and also lifted the siege of Qianyang, and retreated to Zhijiang for a meeting. Knowing that the future was difficult to achieve, they sent representatives to Hongjiang to express their willingness to make peace, and telegraphed the province to explain the misunderstanding, and requested instructions on the route to Hubei. At this point, the military situation between Hunan and Guizhou has a hope of reconciliation. Here are two telegrams from Chen Wo and Xiang Chengzu, the senator who went to Hongjiang to investigate, (Telegram 1) Report of Victory, 1. According to a telegram from Hongjiang, the rebels from Qianyang City crossed the river at dawn, and were severely attacked by our troops head-on, sinking two rebel ships, killing rebel Battalion Commander Li Guojun and dozens of officers and soldiers. At that time, the Hou and Liu Regiments of Mao's troops in Qianyang also provided assistance from the front, and the rebels were greatly defeated and fled in disarray. Our brigade headquarters has now advanced to Ganxiping. 2. Chen Dongsheng (Wo) led his troops and the local defense entered Hong on the cold day, and the Liu Zhuming (Xie Bin Regiment Commander) rebel troops retreated to Ruoshui. The brothers are allowed to go to Hong on the Xiao day. Your brother Xiang Chengzu respectfully deletes the Hai seal, (Telegram 2) The Li rebels colluded with two regiments of the Xie Division, and attacked Qian in separate ways. After the official supervised the team to stop them, from the slight beginning to the cold end, fortunately the troops of Mao's department in Qianyang went to the rescue, and the soldiers used their lives. The Battle of Niutoushan was enough to frighten the enemy. Because Xie felt that it was difficult to violate the great righteousness, he specially sent a representative, Li Jianzhong, to come to apologize and seek peace, and promised to move to western Hubei immediately, and said that he had strictly investigated the troublemaking regiments. Now a part of the army has retreated to Yuanzhou (that is, Zhijiang) City, and Li rebels are stationed outside the city. A part retreated to Huitong, and our army is tracking and pursuing. On the Zhijiang side, it has reached Tiedunpo, and on the Huitong side, it is also making progress. May I ask if you can specify the route and order Xie's troops to move to western Hubei, and wait for instructions. I respectfully telegraph this report, Chen Wo respectfully bows the Xian Wu seal.</p>
<p>He Jian believed that since Xie had agreed to go to western Hubei, there would be no problem. He immediately replied to Xie with a telegram, ordering him to leave Hunan according to the specified route. The text said, "Urgent, Commander Xie Xun of Chenzhou and Yuanzhou, sent by Tan, each telegram has been read, the Chen Brigade and Li Regiment rebelled, and are being investigated and dealt with. The Liu Regiment of your department helped the rebels to make trouble, and repeatedly occupied Hongjiang, and has repeatedly reported to Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Chief Supervisor He to stop it. Yesterday, Regiment Commander Zhu Ming of Liu sent a telegram from Hongjiang saying that Zhu Ming was ordered to go to Hubei and came to Hong by the way, and asked the Chen Brigade to withdraw quickly, and as soon as the Qianbian merchants arrive in Hong, they will continue to advance, etc. It has been confirmed that the 55th and 56th Regiments of your department are stationed in Hongjiang and Denglong Bridge and Baima Pavilion across the river from Qianyang, and have been attacking the Chen Brigade for days, and Acting Brigade Commander Chen has been besieged. It is obvious that he intends to help the rebels. There is no reason for a revolutionary to take a stand. According to the previous telegram, you should immediately go through Zhijiang, Mayang, Qiancheng, and Yongshun, and quickly open to western Hubei to maintain the prestige of the central government, otherwise, for the sake of the security of Hunan Province, it will also be detrimental to your department. Especially reply, your brother He Jian bows", At the same time, Chen Chen Quzhen was notified by telegram that Xie's troops were allowed to take the Maqian Yong route to Hubei, and to monitor their departure from the country properly. Therefore, Luo Fanying's trip to Bao has also been postponed.</p>
<h3>Longyan Communist Bandits Re-Occupy Xipuying</h3>
<p>▲ Zhan Diaoyuan's Family Kidnapped</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence, 19th: Since Longyan organized the Western Fujian Soviet, the flames of communism in Western Fujian have been rekindled. After the communist leader Deng Zihui led 2,000 bandits to capture Yongfu, the Zhangzhou garrison was heavily guarded in Nan Jing and Huaan, and they did not dare to go south. They then fled eastward, sending their false second Regiment Commander Deng Gangyi to lead more than 1,000 bandits to spy on Zhangping. They captured Yuntan Town on the 15th. The local militia Chen Naiwu was outnumbered and had dozens of firearms seized. Liu Liebo retreated to the Liancheng border. After Yuntan was captured, Xipuying was in imminent danger. Xipuying is an important town in eastern Longyan, connected to Zhangping. After Yuntan was captured, Liu Liebo and others all retreated first, leaving only 60 or 70 men from the local militia Zhan Jifu's Department. Zhan is the younger brother of the provincial commissioner Zhan Diaoyuan and a prominent local family. Knowing that the situation was critical, they were on guard day and night. From the 6th to the 13th, there was no movement. At dawn on the 14th, Deng Gangyi suddenly led 1,000 bandits to attack, surrounding Xipuying. They first disarmed the militia sentries, then broke into the fortified buildings, and kidnapped all the militiamen and able-bodied men, women and children of the Zhan family inside the buildings, totaling more than 30 members of Zhan Diaoyuan's family. Zhan Jifu was also among them. The Zhan family's fortified building, named Jinmin, was built in the late Ming Dynasty and could accommodate 400 people. It was the largest fortress in Xipuying. After the bandits broke into the building, they looted all the property and set fire to the building. There was also Zhan Bi, a wealthy man in Xipuying, with more than 100,000 yuan in assets, who was also kidnapped and taken to Longyan. Xipuying is the richest area in eastern Longyan, 20 li from Yuntan and 20 li from Zhangpu County. This capture was more devastating than the loss of Yongfu Baisha, with approximately 80 firearms lost. After Xipuying was captured, communist bandits were also spotted as sentries in Jitai, 60 li from Zhangping. There is no garrison in Zhangping, only Chen Guohua and Lin Weibang's security team of one or two hundred men. Hearing the news, they did not dare to defend the city and retreated to Heshun Township, 20 li from the city. Stores in the city have been closed, and those with a little property have fled to Zhangzhou. The newly formed 1st Division stationed in Zhangzhou heard that it would transfer a battalion of Huang's Regiment from the Huaan garrison to assist, but Huaan is close to Yongfu, and the defense is also very tight, so it is not known whether it can be transferred.</p>
<h3>Xiamen Convenience Steamer Sinking Case</h3>
<p>▲ Tong'an County Has Interrogated Relevant Personnel Once</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: After the "Convenience" steamer sank, the ship's crew was unharmed. Except for the helmsman Su Qili, who escaped, the engineer Huang Dianzhong and the sailors Li Shuishi and Xu Renyu were all arrested by the Wudian Tong'an Public Security Bureau Branch and sent to the Tong'an County Government. A court hearing has been held, and their testimonies are as follows: Li Shuishi testified that he is from Hui'an, 24 years old, and works as a sailor and cook on the "Convenience" motorboat for a monthly salary of 14 yuan. He has been on the ship for six or seven months. The ship usually carries about 120 passengers, most of whom buy connecting tickets from Shuitou to Meiren Palace. Wang Antong from Oucuo sells tickets at sea. He runs the Kaiyuanli grocery store in Aotou. The helmsman Su Qili is from Aotou. There are six people on the ship. Wang Antong takes care of the affairs on the ship. If Wang is not on the ship, the helmsman Su Qili is in charge. The motorboat was bought from Taiwan by the Quanmu Company in Xiamen and is four or five years old. This time, the sailors explained to the stationmaster of Wang Antong station that the ship body was damaged and needed to be repaired. The stationmaster, named Bao Ying but the surname is unknown, said that the Xiujiang motorboat repair was not finished and had to run. There are two motorboats running in this place, one is Xiujiang, which is under repair, leaving only the Convenience. On this day, it sailed from Aotou to Banyuan, and the wind and waves were too large, and it was激沉没. Wang Antong was not on the ship this time, Su Qili was on the ship, and his life and death are unpredictable. It is also said that the old chief inspector of Quan He Company, Lin Tianshou, the new chief inspector, is a Cantonese whose surname is unknown. Xu Renyu testified that he is from Dadeng, Jinmen County, 23 years old, and has parents at home. He joined the ship on the tenth day of the second month of the lunar calendar this year, working as a sailor for a monthly salary of 14 yuan, the same as Li Shuishi. The number of passengers carried at Aotou is notified to the Wutong Station by raising a flag, and the car is sent to pick them up. This time, the sailors notified the stationmaster Bao Ying of the Wutong Station that the ship body was damaged and needed to be repaired. According to the station, only this ship is left and must be run. Wang Antong is on board to take care of the affairs of the ship at sea, and the salary and foreign water is about sixty or seventy yuan per month. The old manager of Quan He Company's surname is Huang. This time, the new manager Chen Youcai was replaced. The previous chief inspector, Lin Tianshou, was familiar with the situation. The new chief inspector is not skilled, causing the ship to have broken spaces, overload, water flooded into the ship, unable to pump water, passengers panicked, and the ship tilted and sank. The ocean from Aotou to Wutong is about ten miles, and it takes half an hour to drive. The ship sailed at half past four o'clock, and it sank at about five o'clock. The Convenience ship has been damaged for more than ten days. Because the Xiujiang motorboat repair has not been completed, the rest of the testimony is the same as Li Shuishi's. Huang Dianzhong testified that he is from Nankang, Minhou, 25 years old, and joined the ship in September of the lunar calendar last year, serving as a driver for a monthly salary of 35 yuan. The ship was bought from Taiwan four or five years ago, and the machine is not damaged. The ship body has leaks. At that time, the customs signed the name, and only 85 passengers were allowed. This time, there were about 100 passengers. Wang Antong was not on the ship and opened the Kaiyuanli grocery store in Aotou. This time the ship leaked, and everyone has notified Bao Ying. According to the answer, the Xiujiang is not finished repairing and must drive. This time there were too many passengers, the wind and waves were too big, the water flooded into the boat, causing it to sink. The rest of the testimony is the same as Li Shuishi and Xu Renyu. Qiu Jun, the county magistrate of Tong'an, believed that the case was of great importance, so he sent a commissioner Ge Minghao on the 16th with three official letters, one to the Siming County Government, one to the Xiamen Maritime Public Security Bureau, and one to the Siming District Court, to discuss the handling of the case. Deng Jian, President of the Siming District Court, believed that the incident occurred in the jurisdiction of Tong'an, and should be handled by Tong'an County. The Tong'an County Magistrate believed that the defendant, Jinhe Company's Automobile Company, was located in the Siming County border, and should be jointly tried by the judicial authorities of the two counties in a special court. However, the Procuratorate of the Siming District Court believed that most of the parties involved were under its jurisdiction and could not be ignored. Therefore, on the 16th, the relatives of the victims Fang Tianxi, Fang Youzhi, Fang Fuquan, and Fang Fulian, and the defendant, Chen, the manager of Quanhe Automobile Company, were summoned to court for questioning. The defendant did not arrive. The trial was resumed on the 17th, and the defendant still did not appear. An arrest warrant has now been issued.</p>
<h3>Northeast Mongolian Banner Representatives Arrive in Shenyang</h3>
<p>▲ Preparatory Meeting to Be Held ▲ Re-Determine the Date of Departure to Beijing</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: In order to plan for the construction of Mongolia and Tibet, the central government resolved that Mongolian and Tibetan conferences would be held in the capital in April and May of this year. Last October, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission was responsible for preparing everything, and set the Mongolian conference to be held from April 10 to April 30, and set a deadline of March 30 for all representatives to gather in Beiping, where the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission's office in Beiping would receive them and go to Beijing. At that time, they would attend the meeting. After the representatives of each league and banner were selected according to the schedule, they were waiting to depart. However, the situation suddenly changed. The representatives of the leagues and banners in the northwest, although some had arrived in Beiping or were on the way, have already returned one after another. The three leagues, one part, and three banners in the northeast, with 46 representatives, had responded to Zhang Xueliang's call in advance. The delegation consisted of 34 people, (including Bao Yaqing, Zhao Fuyue, Yi Sachun, Zhao Jingshen, Bao Fengming, Jin Yucai, Bao Fuhuan, Yang Yin'cun, Wang Xinzhi, and Han Shuxuan, ten representatives from the Zhaowuda League; Du Shunqing, Dai Xiquan, Guo Yating, Zhang Shaoting, Bai Fusan, Chen Zishan, Tong Shuren, Li Fangna, Damuda, and Hasaoqi, ten representatives from the Zhuosotu League; Su Yushu, Zhao Huichen, Wu Shoushan, Wu Fengming, Bai Futing, Bai Ziming, Bai Xiuquan, Chang Ziyan, Ge Mingge, and Dusiqi, ten representatives from the Jerim League; Su Guiting and De Rongxuan, two representatives from the East Butha Banner; Dun Yating and Du Guochen, two representatives from the West Butha Banner,) had arrived in Shenyang in advance, and the Mongolian Banner Office of the Northeast Political Affairs Committee sent people to receive them. The daily reception fee is about 150 yuan. According to the representatives of Hulunbuir, they can also arrive within a week. However, the meeting called by the central government has passed the scheduled date. Even if it is held, whether 46 representatives are enough to meet the legal quorum. Therefore, the Political Committee telegraphed the central government to inquire whether the delegation should go to Beijing or not. They then received a reply, instructing the entire delegation to go to Beijing immediately. It has now been decided here that after the Hulunbuir representatives arrive in Shenyang, a preparatory meeting will be held in Shenyang before the date of departure to Beijing is re-determined.</p>
<h3>Harbin Communist Leader Dai Haizhou Arrested</h3>
<p>▲ Director of the Special Education Department Replaced</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence, 15th: After the "International Coordination News" was smashed, the activities of the Communist Party in Harbin received extreme attention from the Northeast authorities. Liao Fang had received a secret report that, in addition to Wang Lifeng and Yu Ergui, the other major communist leaders were Dai Haizhou and Zhang Baosi. Zhang Baosi was arrested, and Wang Lifeng and Yu Ergui had fled without a trace. Dai Haizhou was hiding in the port, moving several times a day, secretly plotting to incite a strike among the 36 shed railway workers. The railway worker leader Li Zhenqi originally colluded with Dai. Li was previously arrested by the police and sent to Shenyang. Dai was at large. On the 10th of this month, the Northeast Political Affairs Committee telegraphed the Special Police Department, setting a deadline of three days to arrest Dai and send him to Liaoning. Bao Wenyou, director of the Special Police Department, secretly ordered the detective team, the investigation bureau, and the heads of each department to arrest Dai within three days and offered a reward of 1,000 yuan. Yesterday, the 14th, the detective team leader Zhu Baoshan discovered that Dai was hiding in the home of a Russian in Qinjiagang West Ba Zha City. At 9:00 PM that night, he led several police officers to arrest him and found a work plan on his body, which detailed the plan to carry out agitation of the labor movement and burn down important government offices. After being arrested, he was interrogated overnight and sent to Liaoning at 10:40 PM on the 15th. The police feared that his accomplices would gather to make trouble, so they forbade the newspapers from publishing this news. The newspapers' defense against the Communist Party has not yet been lifted. Printing factories are equipped with wooden sticks and iron pestles for use in the event of an attack by thugs. There are quite a few dangerous elements among the students of secondary schools in the Special Zone. Recently, they have also organized groups such as the Anti-Imperialist Great Alliance and the Freedom Alliance, sending declarations to the newspapers and forcing them to publish them. The newspapers have all refused. These people have threatened to destroy all the newspapers in the port and burn them down in the next few days, and have organized a suicide squad to attack the newspaper factories. Therefore, the police authorities ordered the security team to be dispatched day and night to prevent any unexpected events. The Liao authorities believed that the thinking of students in the special zone was deteriorating day by day, and decided to take the opportunity to actively eliminate it before it spread. Therefore, they specially transferred Zhang Guozhen, the director of the Department of Education, back to the Border Defense Commander's Office to serve as a secretary, and sent another capable person to Harbin to rectify it. However, it has not yet been announced. It is heard that the Third International's Red Internationalization of the Northeast has already planned the steps. The first step is to use money to buy Chinese youths who are not determined and carry out a terrorist plan. Therefore, the authorities are strictly preventing it and are also trying their best to be thorough.</p>

Not only was it difficult for the rich to live in peace, but even middle-class families were uneasy. Recently, the Dada Liner, which runs from Yancheng to Shaobo, has been robbed a total of five times since the beginning of February this year. The Dasheng Liner, which runs from Yancheng to Taizhou, was also patronized by bandits once. All kinds of disturbances are too difficult to describe.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>Monks Arrested and Religious Processions Prohibited: At Dongyue Temple and Qilaoye Temple in Xitang Town, religious processions are held on the 29th day of the lunar March every year. The town's party department, due to the unstable situation and frequent robberies, requested the county government to strictly prohibit them, and arrested the monks Bao Cheng and De Jing living in the temple and detained them in the county bureau. It also sent people to Xitang to persuade the stores to stop the religious procession. As for the detained monks, they will only be released after the religious procession is over.</p>
<p>County Government Convenes District Division Meeting: County Magistrate Shen Guangxiong convened a district division meeting in the county on the afternoon of the 19th. It was decided that the first district is the urban area of Yong'an Ganqiao, with district chief Li Bingzong, the second district is Fengjing Zhanghui Dayun Temple, with district chief Zhang Xingeng, the third district is Xitang Yuyao Dingzha, with district chief Lu Baozhi, and the fourth district is Taozhuang Tianren Hongjiawan Yangmiao, with district chief Fu Jinkui. It was unanimously approved.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Examination for County Magistrate Passes Physical Examination: For this third examination for county magistrates in this province, the local people who registered for the examination were Gao Chichang, the first section chief of the county government, Zhu Zhilai, and the secretary Li Guangye. According to Hangzhou News, a physical examination was held on the 18th. A total of 268 people passed the examination. It is said that Mr. Gao and Section Chief Zhu also passed the examination. It is scheduled to hold a written examination in the auditorium of the provincial government starting on the morning of the 20th.</p>
<p>Bandit Traces Found in Qingyanghui: At about 8:00 AM on the 18th, twenty-eight bandit boats came from the Xin Kaihe River to Qingyanghui in Xindai, carrying about 200 bandits, all of whom were armed and had several cannons, and went to Mingzhu'an. They had lunch at Yuqitang and then went from Hengmatou to Shantang. It seemed that they were going to Liujiayan Bridge. The Provincial Security Team stationed in Chenghuang Temple heard the news and transported them to Xincang on the Jiufeng Small Wheel to suppress the bandits.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Two Towns in Xixiang Robbed and Plundered by Bandits: Xiaoxikou in Changxing, which belongs to Huzhou, has many wealthy merchants and people, so it is coveted by bandits. At 12:00 PM on the night of the 18th, several bandit boats suddenly came, with fifty or sixty bandits, each holding wooden shell guns, swarming ashore and rushing into the market. Dozens of shots were fired. The firearms of the local security group had been robbed by bandits a few days ago, so there was no resistance. The bandits robbed and plundered at will. More than half of the seventy stores in the town were robbed. It seemed that thirty stores, such as Jingcheng Cloth Store, Hengyuan Dong Sauce Garden, and Wu Dachang, were robbed. The loss was about 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. At about 10:00 PM on the night of the 18th at Xucang Bridge, more than thirty bandits suddenly came, traveling on two Wushan boats and several Jiangbei civilian boats. After landing, several bandits guarded the east and west entrances of the town, and the remaining bandits searched the stores. Stores such as Aoxi Chengjing Goods Store, Jisheng Store, Yu Hengtai, and Chen Dingfeng, as well as more than ten residents such as Wu Manting, were not spared. The loss was nearly 10,000 yuan. However, Wu Manting, a gentry in Xucang Bridge, had a son who was a teacher in a primary school in Changxing. Manting hired a boat to Changxing to see his son on the morning of the 17th. When passing through Hengtang Ferry, six bandits suddenly stood on the shore with guns and threatened to stop the boat. The bandits got off the boat and tied up Wu Manting. There is still no news of him. Suddenly, the next day, his family was robbed by bandits, and all the more than fifty dan of rice and clothes were looted.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Hiring Debt Raising Committee Members: The Zhejiang Provincial Government started raising construction bonds, and yesterday specially hired 40 members of the debt raising committee, mostly well-known figures in the economic circles of the province and other provinces, such as Jin Baishun, Zhang Renfu, Zhang Xuren, Wang Xiangquan, Wang Zhuqi, Mi Tingfang, and the presidents of the Jiaxing Wuxing Shaoxing Ningbo Chambers of Commerce, were all among those hired.</p>
<p>Regulations on the Proportion of Sugar Donations in the Province: The sugar donation in Zhejiang Province is implemented as a provincial office, and the director has been ordered to set up an office at the Sanqiao Zhizhixia to collect taxes. The proportion of donations was stipulated by the provincial government yesterday, with an annual amount of 544,800 yuan. The collection fee is set at 36,000 yuan, and the average monthly allocation is limited to 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Dahua Slider Allowed Exclusive Operation: The Zhejiang Construction Department, according to Dahua Slider Company's presentation, researched successfully and requested exclusive operation for ten years, and specially formulated five protection laws, and forwarded them to the provincial government for resolution, allowing exclusive operation for ten years.</p>
<p>Regulations on Short-Term Loans for the Qianye Industry: The Hangzhou Qianye industry held a meeting of colleagues in Liucui Jingxiang yesterday to discuss the matter of granting six pairs of long-term loans. It was decided that the loan granting date should be from April 28 to November 19 of the lunar calendar this year, which has a leap month, and one pair should be granted according to the regulations, for a total of seven pairs and nineteen days. The price of each large dish is ten yuan and five jiao per thousand yuan, totaling seventy-three yuan and five jiao per thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>County Government's Request for Loan Repayment: Xiaoshan borrowed 10,000 yuan from various commercial firms in the city to handle land reports last fall due to lack of funds. It was to be paid in three installments, and also to be repaid in three installments. Later, the commercial firms were in urgent need of the last installment at the end of the year and were unable to raise the funds, so they borrowed the tenth and eleventh installments, totaling 6,375 yuan. The installment due at the end of January was used to offset the installment due at the end of December, and the remaining two installments should be repaid on time. Unexpectedly, the deadline has long passed, and the government has not heard from them. The commercial firms jointly submitted a petition to the County Chamber of Commerce and forwarded it to the County Government, requesting prompt repayment to alleviate the difficulties of the merchants.</p>
<p>Loan and Property Committee Recovers Fish Pond Donations: Many fish farmers in Xiaoshan have not yet paid the fish pond education rent and donations from last year. Now it is the season for rice planting in the spring of this year. Since last year's rent and donations have not been paid, this year's rent and donations must be continued. Yesterday, the Public Loan and Public Property Acceptance Committee specially sent a letter to the County Government requesting that the police be sent to the rural areas to strictly urge payment from household to household in order to close the case.</p>
<p>Three Deaths from Eating White Turtle: The family of Fu Jingchun, a fisherman from Chen Yuhu in the Hutou area of Xixiang, Xiaoshan, caught a white turtle weighing about one catty and fourteen taels in Baima Lake on the 18th. He cooked it and ate it at home. At midnight, his wife and daughter, a total of three people, were poisoned and died.</p>

<h3>The Seventh Day of the National Education Conference</h3>
<p>The Fourth General Meeting was Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Temporary Proposal on Literacy Campaign Passed</p>
<p>Three Plans for Junior High School Social Education Discussed</p>
<p>The Fifth General Meeting will Continue this Morning</p>
<p>Closing Ceremony in the Afternoon after the General Meeting Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>The Situation of the Fourth General Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday was the seventh day of the National Education Conference, and the fourth general meeting was held, as well as a meeting to review education expenses. The situation is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Opening Situation</h3>
<p>The bell rang at 2:00 PM to open the meeting. The chairman was still Vice President Chen Hexian. First, he respectfully read the General's Instructions. All stood in silence. Next, the case of Wu Zhihui and others' temporary proposal to request the Ministry of Education to actively promote the literacy campaign in the shortest possible time was opened for discussion.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Literacy Campaign Proposal</h3>
<p>▲Passed without Dissent</p>
<p>Liu Zhanen stood up and said that if there was no dissent, this case would be considered passed. The chairman asked, and the public had no dissent, so it was considered passed.</p>
<h3>Discussion of Elementary Education Plan</h3>
<p>｜Resolutions｜</p>
<p>(1) Kindergartens should all be run by Chinese people.</p>
<p>(2) Health education should involve special training.</p>
<p>(3) Moral education and curriculum must be separated.</p>
<p>(4) Elementary schools and kindergartens should, as a principle, be free of charge.</p>
<p>(5) Each province may establish special schools.</p>
<p>▲Establishment</p>
<p>Xiong Mengfei said that, after reviewing the report, the sixth item under the establishment section, that elementary education in any country should be run by nationals, and that foreigners absolutely cannot be allowed to run it arbitrarily, should be retained. Chen Dezheng, Li Zhaohuan, and others seconded the motion.</p>
<p>Wei Tingsheng said that this point must be considered. If the abolition of extraterritoriality does not allow foreigners to establish elementary schools, then the problem of education for the children of foreign nationals will cause panic. Therefore, there is no need to retain this item. We only need to develop our national compulsory education so that Chinese children do not enter foreign schools.</p>
<p>Liu Zhan'en said that currently, the large, medium, and small schools within China that were originally run by foreigners are now all presided over by Chinese people. As long as they do not violate the Chinese education regulations, they can be allowed to establish schools. At a time when promoting universal education, it is especially necessary to allow these schools to exist to help promote compulsory education.</p>
<p>Tao Xuan said that Mr. Wei's concern that if item six is deleted, foreigners who want to educate their own children will not be able to establish elementary schools is an overestimation. Elementary schools and kindergartens are basic education, and it is necessary to ensure that they are run by nationals.</p>
<p>Huang Jianzhong said that item six under the establishment section is the most important issue in this plan. This representative believes that it is necessary to retain it. The reasons have already been stated by Mr. Xiong and Mr. Tao. Moreover, foreign religious families instill their beliefs from a young age. Therefore, education in early childhood is a critical period for shaping character, and caution must be exercised. If this is not done, the spirit of the Three Principles of the People will be lost.</p>
<p>Xie Shuying said that Christian-run education has 6,890 institutions.</p>
<p>After a long discussion, the majority passed a motion to maintain the original plan (the original plan was "Non-Chinese people or organizations not entirely composed of Chinese people shall not establish elementary schools or kindergartens. Teachers and staff of elementary schools and kindergartens shall be limited to people who are entirely citizens of the Republic of China.")</p>
<p>▲Curriculum</p>
<p>Jin Baoshan said that it is difficult for doctors to be responsible for health education under item nine. There are only two or three such people in the world, so there should be special training to cultivate suitable talents. Jin then used a mimeographed paper to attach Wei Que's proposal to Jin Baoshan's proposal, believing that the education of the Three Principles of the People must pay attention to health education. Yu Ziyi seconded the motion and sent the written opinion to the drafting section of the assembly to revise the articles.</p>
<p>▲Moral Education</p>
<p>Chen Dezheng said that he opposes incorporating moral education into the curriculum. Under the Three Principles of the People, special attention must be paid to moral education. Therefore, it is appropriate to retain moral education as a separate item. Chen Heqin said that elementary education is different from middle school and university education. Therefore, it is appropriate to combine moral education and academic affairs into one to implement holistic education. Moral education and academic affairs cannot be separated.</p>
<p>Chen Dezheng said that the division of moral education and curriculum is not meant to be an absolute separation. The fear of establishing it separately is to show the importance of the spirit of the party.</p>
<p>Chen Heqin said that not only should moral education be based on the Three Principles of the People, but the curriculum should also be based on the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, combining them into one chapter of the curriculum does not harm the spirit of the party. Yu Ziyi said that the draft was separated, but the review committee merged them into one group. If the articles are merged according to the review committee, there will be inappropriate places. Therefore, he seconded Chen Dezheng's proposal and agreed to separate them. The chairman put it to a vote. The majority voted in favor of separating moral education.</p>
<p>▲Expenses</p>
<p>Chen Dezheng said that the review committee stipulated "no more than two yuan per semester." Can it be changed to "Elementary schools and kindergartens should, as a principle, be free of charge. In places with affluent local economies, fees may be charged at the discretion of the local authorities. Each city and county shall formulate regulations based on the local economic conditions of each elementary school and kindergarten, and submit them to the higher-level education administrative organs for approval and implementation." The majority passed the motion.</p>
<p>Zheng Hongnian proposed that the third item on expenses should be deleted. A minority did not pass the motion.</p>
<p>▲School Grade System</p>
<p>Chen Jianxiu said that the fourth item of the revised articles should be deleted because the establishment of special schools for children is mixed with social education. Therefore, it can be deleted. Meng Xiancheng seconded the motion. Wang Maozu said that education for the disabled is, according to international practice, included in social education. As for education for geniuses, it is included in ordinary elementary schools. The item is as follows: Each province should establish special schools, such as schools for geniuses, according to local needs and economic capabilities. Each city and county should establish special classes for children at their discretion.</p>
<h3>Report from the Secondary Education Group</h3>
<p>After the discussion on elementary education was completed, Chairman Liao Shicheng, on behalf of the Secondary Education Group, reported.</p>
<p>Section 3, Regulations for the Establishment of Secondary Schools,</p>
<p>Second Measure,</p>
<p>A. Change "shall not add" to "temporarily postpone adding", and add "except for provinces with annual education expenditures of more than 2 million yuan or only have one senior high school".</p>

<p>C. Change to "Ratio of the number of general high schools and agricultural and industrial high schools in a province".</p>
<p>(1) The senior high school general department and the agricultural and industrial departments should each account for half of the total number of schools in principle.</p>
<p>(2) If the number of general high schools and agricultural and industrial high schools exceeds a ratio of three to one, at least the general high schools exceeding the ratio should be converted into agricultural or industrial departments during the political tutelage period.</p>
<p>J. Change "should be established in provinces that have not yet established" to "establish two high schools in each province, for a total of twenty schools. Except for eleven general departments, with one school in each province, the remaining schools will be seven agricultural departments and three industrial departments (the years and number of schools established for each department are detailed in the first and second budget tables listed below). The education departments of each province shall formulate school establishment plans based on the circumstances and submit them to the Ministry of Education for approval and implementation."</p>
<p>(D) Add an item under the (D) item, (E) which states that provinces with only one high school should add another one during the political tutelage period, so that each province has at least one general high school and one agricultural or industrial high school by the end of the political tutelage period. The education departments of each province shall formulate school establishment plans and submit them to the Ministry of Education for approval and implementation (not listed in the budget). The original (E) is moved to (F).</p>
<p>3. ) (A) Standards for the Establishment of General Department Senior High Schools, (1) Change 1 million yuan to 600,000 yuan, (2) Change 500 students to 300 students, (3) Change 20% to 25%.</p>
<p>(B) (1) Change 1 million yuan to 600,000 yuan, (2) Change 400 students to 250 students, (3) Change 10% to 25%.</p>

<p>The following explanation should be added after item C:</p>

<p>Third, (A) Change "four years" to "seven years"</p>
<p>The group believes that all other items are practical and easy to implement and are passed unanimously. However, the group agrees to send the amended text to the editorial office for subsequent distribution. The group also believes that the following three items should be added to the overall plan, and the Ministry of Education will formulate detailed methods:</p>
<p>(1) Outline of Moral Education for Secondary Schools,</p>
<p>(2) Methods for Promoting Outstanding Students in Middle Schools,</p>
<p>(3) Scholarship and Assistance Methods for Impoverished Students in Middle Schools.</p>
<h3>Discussion of Secondary Education</h3>
<p>｜Resolutions｜</p>
<p>(1) Ratio of general, teacher training, commercial, and agricultural/industrial high schools.</p>
<p>(2) Private schools can receive subsidies after four years of registration.</p>
<p>(3) Other items passed except for the budget item which is reserved.</p>
<p>Wei Que said that the review report is generally very good, but it lacks guidance on vocational guidance and educational guidance, so the Secondary Education Group should pay attention.</p>
<p>Zhao Naichuan said that these two items should be supplemented.</p>
<p>▲Regulations for the Establishment of Secondary Schools</p>
<p>Zhuang Zexuan said that the restriction on general secondary schools is to seek vocational training for middle school students to facilitate their employment. This representative believes that the regulation that the general department and the agricultural and industrial departments each account for half of the total number of schools is not appropriate. "Item C, first item" should be changed to a ratio of one to three, that is, one general department and three agricultural and industrial departments. "Item C, second item" can remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Wang Maozu said that it is very difficult to run agricultural and industrial departments, and general departments should also be given attention. For example, Shaanxi Province has Northwest University but no high school, so it is difficult for students to get promoted. They must go to other provinces. After high school, they can take the university entrance exam. In Jiangsu, there are a total of twenty-one middle schools. If fourteen of them need to be converted into agricultural and industrial high schools, the equipment and other costs will be several million yuan. In reality, it may be very difficult.</p>
<p>Tang Shicheng said that the so-called general department in the plan includes commercial, teacher training, and clerical departments, so the ratio of each accounting for half is the ratio with the agricultural and industrial departments. Please pay attention to everyone. Moreover, the number of agricultural and industrial departments and general departments is half each, which already requires several schools to be converted in each province. Therefore, the number is already close to the general department.</p>
<p>Ou Yuanhuai said that the commercial department should not be included in the general department, but should also be regarded as a vocational department. Therefore, this representative believes that the high school general department and the high school agricultural, industrial, and commercial departments should account for a ratio of one to three.</p>
<p>Li Zhaochen seconded Ou Yuanhuai's proposal, with two reasons: (1) Universities have agricultural, industrial, and commercial colleges, and middle schools should also have agricultural, industrial, and commercial departments; (2) For the purpose of training staff for small shops, there should be middle school commercial departments.</p>
<p>Zhao Naichuan said that the inclusion of the commercial department in the general department is from the perspective of funding, because commercial department equipment is simpler than agricultural and industrial department equipment, and not from the perspective of vocational training, because agriculture and industry are vocational education and commerce is not.</p>
<p>Liu Zhan'en agreed to combine commerce and agriculture and industry into one category.</p>
<p>Chen Bulei said that the Secondary Education Group does not deny that the commercial department is vocational education. The reason for proposing the agricultural and industrial departments is nothing more than to increase national production during the period of political tutelage.</p>
<p>Zhu Jingnong said that agriculture, commerce, and industry should not be divided into large categories. The education of the Principle of People's Livelihood is vocationalized. Therefore, the separate listing of agriculture and industry is nothing more than from the perspective of funding.</p>
<p>Meng Xiancheng said that the items in this section can be changed to the ratio of senior high school general department, teacher training department, commercial department, domestic science department, and agricultural/industrial high schools. The majority passed the motion.</p>
<p>▲Rectify Private Middle Schools</p>
<p>Chen Dezheng proposed that item A of the third article of this section should be cancelled.</p>
<p>Zhao Naichuan said that the review group changed the period to seven years, which refers to newly established schools. The reason for setting it at seven years is to look at the performance of their graduates. Chen Dezheng said that junior high school graduation is only three years, so there is no need to set it at seven years. If the restrictions on private middle schools are too strict, it is tantamount to saying that public middle schools must be excellent and private middle schools must be bad. Therefore, it should be deleted to encourage those who are enthusiastic about running schools.</p>
<p>Zhao Naichuan said that the original plan was four years, but the review group changed it to seven years. Chen Dezheng proposed that the first item of the third section must be cancelled. Zheng Hongnian seconded the motion.</p>
<p>Zhu Jingnong said that this case can be voted on whether to delete it or not, and for seven years or four years. The chairman put it to a vote. The majority did not pass the deletion or seven years. As a result, the original plan was maintained that private middle schools can receive subsidies after four years.</p>
<p>▲Regulations for Connecting Middle Schools with Universities and Elementary Schools</p>
<p>Huang Jianzhong said that if all university facilities are based on high schools, there may be problems because the level of universities cannot be improved. Also, this section does not pay attention to vocational schools. Can it be deleted?</p>
<p>Zhao Naichuan said that the review committee will revise the text and distribute it to everyone, so there is no need to be confined to the wording.</p>
<p>▲Budget</p>
<p>Yu Qingtang said that except for the budget, the rest of this chapter can be passed. There was no objection from the public. The chairman then announced a ten-minute break.</p>
<h3>Report from the Social Education Group</h3>
<p>The meeting continued at 4:10 PM. Lei Peihong, chairman of the Social Education Group, reported the results of the review.</p>
<h3>Summary of the Social Group's Review Results</h3>
<p>(Detailed report, already recorded in yesterday's newspaper)</p>
<p>(1) In addition to the various articles stipulated in the principles of the implementation outline, it is proposed to specially use phonetic symbols as a medium for literacy within all activities in the scope of social education, so item G is added.</p>
<p>(2) It is proposed to industrialize the staff engaged in social education work, so the fifth article of the implementation outline has been revised.</p>
<p>(3) The main social education institutions sponsored by the central government are proposed to be prepared and established at the same time, but it is still proposed to set a time limit for their establishment separately, so the order and content stipulated in the original plan have been revised.</p>
<p>(4) It is proposed to popularize the social education industry sponsored by local governments, so the eighth and ninth items are added under the outline of "planning and promoting various main social education institutions".</p>
<p>(5) It is proposed to pay considerable attention to the education of the mentally and physically disabled, so some additions and changes have been made to "planning the establishment of special education and reformatory education methods".</p>
<p>(6) Civic training is an important task during the political period, and both school education and social education should share responsibility, so some additions and changes have been made to the cooperation methods between the two sides stipulated in the original plan.</p>
<h3>Discussion of the Social Education Plan</h3>
<p>｜Resolutions After Full Discussion by the Audience｜</p>
<p>(1) Each provincial education department and special city may establish social and mass education teacher training institutions.</p>
<p>(2) The preparatory office for the public theater should select foreign art talents familiar with foreign languages to study abroad.</p>
<p>(3) Other review reports passed except for the budget point which is reserved.</p>
<p>When discussing the improvement of the social education plan, Li Zheng proposed that if there is no objection to the review plan except for the budget point, it can be regarded as approved. Huang Shiheng said that the farmers' education center can be included in the mass education center, and there is no need to list the farmers' education center as a separate item. Chen Bulei said that some provinces have already established farmers' education centers, so there is no need to delete them. A bracket can be added to let each province do as they please. Huang Jianzhong said that in the fifth second line of the implementation outline, setting up social education departments in normal universities and various university education colleges is in accordance with the university regulations. As for the establishment of social education colleges or mass education colleges, there is no place for them in the university regulations, so there is no need to establish them separately. For the sake of cultivating talents, equivalent classes can be set up in universities or other schools in each province to proceed. Therefore, the first paragraph should be deleted. Sun Guiding agreed with Huang Jianzhong's proposal that there is no need to establish a separate social education college. It is only necessary to set up a social education department in the education college. Yu Qingtang said that in light of the situation of education in China, it is necessary to establish a social education college separately. Huang Jianzhong said that compulsory education and social education are equally important. Now the compulsory education college has been cancelled because it does not comply with the regulations, so there is no need to establish a social education college separately. Chen Dezheng said that it is better to change it to a social education training course or a mass education training course, which will not conflict with the university regulations and can take into account the fact that various provinces have already established this type of school. Chen Jianxiu said that the resolutions of this meeting do not have to adhere to the regulations, and for the sake of facts, each province has established them, so it is better to let each province do as they please. Tang Maoru said that the teachers of social education have a more complex target audience, including adults, youth, men, and women, etc., and are not compulsory education teachers, whose target audience is children, which is relatively simple. This must be paid attention to. As for the requirements of the facts, during the six-year period of political tutelage, the teachers must be trained by special organic institutions. This must be paid attention to. Therefore, he advocated retaining the original text of the review committee. Chen Dezheng said that a special city education bureau should be added under the education department of each province. Ou Yuanhuai said that the name should be changed to a social education or mass education teacher training institution for each province to choose from. Xie Shuying said that undertakings and knowledge develop from simple to complex. The basic department of the mass education college is the same as the education college, so there is no need to establish it separately and it should be cancelled. The chairman put it to a vote to change Ou Yuanhuai's proposal to each provincial education department and special city can establish a social education or mass education teacher training institution, and the majority passed the motion. Xie Shuying proposed that the preparatory office of the public theater should select graduates from specialist schools or above who are proficient in foreign languages and have artistic talents to go to various countries to study and conduct specialized research, and that except for the budget, it will be passed if there is no objection.</p>

<h3>Zhu Jingnong Temporarily Proposed Drafting a General Assembly Declaration</h3>
<p>▲Nominate Chen Bulei and Other Five Committee Members</p>
<p>▲Zhang Mojun Asks to Pay Attention to Two Points</p>
<p>Next, Zhu Jingnong temporarily moved that the General Assembly declaration urgently needs to nominate commissioners to engage in drafting and asked to put it to a vote.

<h3>Hu Hanmin's Speech This Morning</h3>
<p>▲Absent Yesterday</p>
<p>The General Assembly originally asked Hu Hanmin to attend and give a speech at yesterday's meeting, but this has been changed to a speech at today's morning meeting.</p>
<h3>Closing Ceremony Tomorrow Afternoon</h3>
<p>▲The Sixth General Assembly Will Be Held in the Morning</p>
<p>The sixth general assembly will be held on the morning of the 23rd, and the closing ceremony will be held in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Public Banquet Tomorrow Night</h3>
<p>▲The Education Fees Group Will Meet This Afternoon</p>

<h3>Flexible Implementation of Plans Allowed</h3>
<p>▲Zhang Honglie and Others Proposed Today</p>
<p>Member Zhang Honglie and others will propose to the General Assembly on the 22nd to add an article to the end of the resolutions of this meeting: "If special circumstances arise in a certain region during the implementation of this plan, the local provincial and municipal education administrative authorities may submit a plan to the Ministry of Education for flexible implementation." However, the majority of members believe that the plan resolved at this General Assembly has already paid special attention to local circumstances and has considerable flexibility. If another plan is stipulated, the implementation may be flexible at any time, and there are fears that the plan will be fundamentally shaken. It is questionable whether the plan will be established.</p>
<h3>Proposed Ban on Students Joining the YMCA</h3>
<p>▲Xiao Jishan, Chen Dezheng, and Others Are Drafting It</p>
<p>Xiao Jishan, Chen Dezheng, and others plan to propose to the General Assembly to ban young students nationwide from joining the YMCA and are currently drafting it.</p>
<h3>Ouyang Yuanhuai and Others Propose a Resolution to Aid Education in Fujian</h3>
<p>Members Ouyang Yuanhuai, Xu Shoushang, Wang Maozu, Tang Maoru, Zhuang Zexuan, Yu Qingtang, Jiang Li, Sun Zuosu, Chen Dezheng, Chen Heqin, Liu Zhanen, Wang Qiuhang, Jin Baoshan, Qiu Zhenzhong, Xu Jijie, Hou Hongjian, Zhuang Kuizhang, and others, proposed to the assembly a resolution to aid education in Fujian.</p>
<p>(Facts) According to the report by representatives Hou Hongjian and Zhuang Kuizhang, since Commissioner Cheng took office in Fujian's education department, he increased educational funding, reorganized primary and secondary schools, delineated public and private boundaries, and expanded educational endeavors. In over a year, the plans were being realized and were expected to yield results. However, the coup d'état on the 6th of this year led to Commissioner Cheng's arrest, initially detained in Yanping, and now in Youxi. His personal situation, mental state, and physical form are suffering. In the education department, not only are educational funds being withheld by various parties, preventing the implementation of various necessary measures, but also, due to the resulting influence, it is not uncommon to see education bureau chiefs and supervisors in various counties being beaten and expelled by local figures. School disturbances occur frequently, and the decline in academic atmosphere is beyond repair. With the provincial government in a state of anarchy, there is little hope for education. Although this National Education Conference is limited to discussing proposals, given the recent situation in Fujian as described above, what should our sentiments be? This report is a brief overview of the situation, and we must devise methods to aid the educational situation in Fujian.</p>
<p>(Reasons) Fujian is an important province in the South. According to the report, various chaotic states have plunged it into anarchy. The Education Commissioner has been unjustly arrested due to political changes. For three to four months, the central government has not resolved the issues in Fujian, and the Ministry of Education has not implemented any measures for the province's education. Although this conference has limitations on the scope of discussion, the colleagues believe it would be regrettable to ignore and not discuss such a significant matter concerning Fujian. We must devise methods to aid the situation. Therefore, a temporary motion is proposed to the assembly for discussion, petitioning the Ministry of Education to take action. Whether this is feasible should be decided by public vote.</p>
<h3>Fujian People's Association for National Salvation Requests Assistance with Cheng's Case</h3>
<p>The Fujian People's Association for National Salvation telegraphed the entire Education Conference on the 20th, stating that Lu Xingbang, the commander of the newly formed Second Division of Fujian, has detained Education Commissioner Cheng Shikui and others for over three months. They requested that a special case be submitted to the central government for handling.</p>
<h3>Administrative Discussion Conference to be Held After the Closing of the General Assembly</h3>
<p>▲ The 24th and 25th</p>
<p>▲ The conference is changed to a discussion</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education had originally planned to hold a National Education Administrative Conference after the closing of the General Education Conference. However, to avoid various disputes and discussions, the Ministry has decided to change the Administrative Conference into an Administrative Discussion Conference. The attendees are to be representatives from each province at the level of Education Commissioner or section chief and above, as well as the Education Bureau Chiefs of special municipalities. The conference is scheduled for the 24th and 25th. The cases that the Ministry of Education had planned to propose have now been canceled and replaced with a discussion format to exchange ideas.</p>

<h3>Various Aspects of the General Assembly</h3>
<p>▲ Jiangsu Education Department Sends Education Overview</p>
<p>▲ The content is divided into six parts...totaling hundreds of thousands of words</p>
<p>Jiangsu Education Commissioner Chen Hexian believes that this National Education Conference brings together education personnel from across the country, an opportunity not to be missed. To introduce the current state of education in Jiangsu Province, he specially instructed the department to compile and print a book titled "Recent Educational Overview of Jiangsu Province." The content is divided into six parts: educational administration, higher education, secondary education, elementary education, social education, and educational funding, totaling several hundred thousand words. A thick volume has been bound and was sent to the reception of the National Education Conference yesterday for distribution.</p>
<p>▲ Vocational Education Society Welcomes Attending Members</p>
<p>The China Vocational Education Society will welcome members from all provinces attending the National Education Conference in Shanghai. Yesterday, the society sent letters to its members, stating, "We respectfully acknowledge your hard work during these days of meetings. Our society has been established for thirteen years, and thanks to the support of various parties, it has some facilities. However, we believe that our colleagues bear heavy responsibilities, but their talents and abilities are limited, and all improvement matters still require guidance from those with expertise. We are delighted to hear that you are coming to the capital and are eager to seek advice from experts, but we are afraid of disturbing you due to the importance of the conference affairs. We plan to welcome you in Shanghai after the closing of the General Assembly to respectfully listen to your instructions. Here is a copy of the China Vocational Education Society in the Republic of China, year 18, for your review, and we hope you will kindly point out any errors."</p>
<p>▲ Jiangsu People's Education Hall Welcomes Members</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial People's Education Hall will hold an expanded propaganda week for people's education in Zhenjiang County Hall from the 22nd to the 28th, divided into display and propaganda. The exhibits related to people's education, such as books, forms, and tools, are very rich. In addition to inviting people to give speeches, there will also be performances by artists in the evening. It is reported that the colleagues preparing the People's Education Propaganda Week are wholeheartedly welcoming all members of the National Education Conference to visit and provide guidance.</p>
<h3>Interesting Anecdotes from the Conference</h3>
<p>▲ Member's Arm Exhibition</p>
<p>When the conference voted, adopting the method of raising hands, the members had some raise their right hands high, some raise their left hands high, and some raise their fists high. The forms were inconsistent, and the darkness, lightness, thickness, and thinness of the arms were of considerable value.</p>
<p>▲ Small Test of Gender and Occupational Psychology</p>
<p>When the amendment of the middle school group was submitted to the conference for discussion, there was much debate about the separation or joint operation of vocational and general courses. The members specifically proposed that among vocational courses, there were agriculture, industry, and commerce, but only domestic science was missing, which was considered incomplete. A female member was to be added, and most of the male members looked at each other and smiled, probably silently acknowledging that the men had neglected this point.</p>
<p>▲ Member Speech Statistics</p>
<p>At the fourth general meeting on the 21st, when discussing the three education plans of elementary, secondary, and social education, the statistics of the number of member speeches were: Chen Dezheng 9 times, Huang Jianzhong 7 times, Chen Jianshu 6 times, Zhao Naichuan 5 times, Zhu Jingnong, Yu Qingtang, and Wang Maozu 4 times each, Chen Heqin and Xie Shuying 3 times each, Chen Bulei, Wei Que, Liu Zhanen, Zheng Hongnian, Ouyang Yuanhuai, Yu Ziyi, Liao Shicheng, and Zhuang Zexuan 2 times each, Tang Maoru, Meng Xiancheng, Tai Mengfei, Mei Zhengyuan, Li Zhaohuan, Li Zheng, Wei Tingsheng, Hu Huahua, Duanmu Kai, Tao Xuan, Zhang Honglie, Huang Zhongheng, and Jin Baoshan once each.</p>
<h3>Plans for the Establishment of National Vocational Schools by Huang Jianzhong</h3>
<p>In the Higher Education Group's plan, many proposals were entirely removed during the final compilation, including the plan to establish national vocational schools. (We have found the original text drafted by Huang Jianzhong and record it as follows for reference.)</p>
<p>Universities emphasize theory, while vocational schools emphasize application. Although this concept has been challenged in recent times, many countries, both Eastern and Western, still have vocational schools and universities existing side by side. Higher education in our country has traditionally been divided into universities and specialized schools. In the twelfth year of the Republic [1923], there were a total of 125 private specialized schools and universities nationwide, with universities accounting for 35 and specialized schools numbering 90. By the fourteenth year [1925], the number of specialized schools had decreased to 85 (according to statistics from the China Education Improvement Association over the years). In the fifteenth year [1926], the number further decreased to 62 (according to a survey of national specialized schools and above by the former Beijing Education Ministry). Currently, including newly established national vocational schools, there are only 50. Moreover, there are approximately 20 public and private law and medical specialized schools scheduled to close. Since the thirteenth year of the Republic [1924], many specialized schools have been transformed into universities, leading to a trend of neglect. The drawbacks of specialized schools in the past are also worth noting. During the late Qing dynasty's preparations for constitutionalism, provinces established numerous law and political science schools. This trend continued into the early Republic, resulting in a plethora of so-called specialized schools, particularly in law and political science, which were often poorly run. They relied solely on lecture notes, lacked libraries, and students could graduate without attending classes regularly. Although specialized schools in agriculture, industry, commerce, and medicine were comparatively better, their curricula were often superficial and lacked practical training. The short duration of medical schools was especially inappropriate. Recognizing the immense importance of law and medicine to social survival and national life, the Ministry of Education issued a clear order in July of the eighteenth year [1929], stipulating that public and private law and medical specialized schools could only continue until their existing students graduated and were prohibited from recruiting new students from the eighteenth academic year onward. Other provincial, public, and registered private vocational schools in agriculture, industry, commerce, fisheries, library science, etc., were instructed to change their names and organizations in accordance with the "Vocational School Organization Law and Regulations." At the same time, provincial and municipal governments were consulted to assess local conditions and determine the necessity of establishing additional vocational schools, and if so, which were most urgent. Except for the provinces of Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Xinjiang, which responded that there was no need to establish additional schools, and Shandong, Hebei, and Fujian, which had instructed their education departments to review the matter but had not yet provided a clear response, eighteen other locations had responded, suggesting the establishment of as many as thirty-five different types of vocational schools. Among them, vocational schools specializing in forestry, agronomy, leather manufacturing, fisheries, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, statistics, papermaking, mining and metallurgy, animal husbandry, sericulture, and shipbuilding were considered particularly urgent for establishment by various provinces and cities (Note 1). The requests from various organizations and legal entities to establish vocational schools were also numerous (Note 2).</p>
<p>Although higher education in Europe and America is mostly concentrated in universities, technical personnel are often trained in vocational schools. Educational systems vary from country to country. Some institutions resemble vocational schools but are actually universities. For example, the Colorado School of Mines in the United States prides itself on training fully qualified engineers. Its program lasts four years and confers degrees, making it essentially a university, equivalent to an independent college in our current system. In France, Switzerland, and Italy, there are many renowned vocational schools with a three-year program that emphasizes rigorous coursework. Graduates are employed by the state and society, and vocational school graduates are often more welcomed by society than university graduates. In Britain, higher education is largely dominated by famous universities, each comprising more than ten schools or colleges scattered throughout the country, granting both degrees and diplomas. University programs generally last three years, while specialized courses vary between one and two years. Therefore, the boundary between vocational schools and universities is difficult to define, and independent vocational schools are relatively few.</p>
<p>Our country has a vast territory, and the development of industry is urgently needed. However, the establishment of any large factory requires the planning of foreign engineers and the management of specialists. This incurs significant costs, and the equipment used often reflects the nationality of the hired engineers. Americans tend to favor American-made equipment, while the British favor British-made equipment, regardless of whether the equipment is the latest invention. The sole criterion for selection is the engineer's nationality. What our country urgently needs now is various types of personnel who can serve as foremen, technicians, and engineers. Vocational schools train foremen, universities train engineers, and vocational schools train technicians, who are intermediate between foremen and engineers. Graduates of vocational schools should start as foremen, gradually advance to technicians, and eventually become engineers. The state must first have a solid core of technical experts before it can talk about an industrial revolution.</p>
<p>Some argue that universities can establish specialized courses with the same entrance requirements and duration as vocational schools, making it unnecessary to re-establish vocational schools. However, vocational schools are limited to applied sciences and arts, unlike university specialized courses, which can involve social sciences. If a university is located in an area without a vocational school, it may establish specialized courses similar in nature to vocational schools. In areas without universities or where a university lacks a specific department, a specific type of vocational school should be established based on local needs. Moreover, vocational schools come in many types with small scope, limited funding needed based on local conditions, and the talent they cultivate will be ideally suited for material construction after the period of political tutelage. In addition to provinces and cities raising their own funds to establish provincial and municipal vocational schools, a plan to establish national vocational schools is outlined below.</p>
<p>First National Forestry Vocational School: Dr. Sun Yat-sen cared deeply about the people's livelihood and listed the construction of forests in northern and central China as a key objective in his industrial plan. In recent years, floods and droughts have been frequent, and food shortages have been prevalent. Afforestation can prevent disasters and increase food production. Therefore, the establishment of a national forestry vocational school is a matter of urgency. National vocational schools should focus on cultivating specialized afforestation personnel to be deployed throughout the country. The location of this school should be convenient. Lushan is located in central China with convenient transportation. Guling is a resort for Chinese and foreigners. Creating a model forest here would not only be visually impressive but also facilitate practical training. An Dong and Qingdao are also suitable locations. In the future, Liaoning Province should establish a provincial forestry vocational school, and Qingdao Municipality should establish a municipal forestry vocational school.</p>
<p>Second National Textile Vocational School: Regarding the silk industry, China produces approximately three million dan of silk annually, with Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces accounting for the majority. Of this, about nine-tenths of the silk produced in the Jiangnan region is woven into silk fabrics for domestic consumption, while one-tenth is our country's largest export commodity, with annual exports of around 100,000 dan (worth approximately 70 million taels), of which Shanghai accounts for three-fifths. Regarding the cotton industry, the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are the most productive cotton-growing region in our country. Nantong, Changshu, Taicang, Jiading, and Shanghai are all famous for producing cotton of the highest quality, suitable for spinning. Zhengzhou is also a cotton market center. In the eleventh year of the Republic [1922], there were 73 yarn mills nationwide, with Shanghai having the most at 28, employing 300,000 workers. Unfortunately, after the European War, both the silk and yarn industries have declined, unable to compete with foreign factories. One of the reasons for this failure is the lack of specialists. To utilize education to recover our rights and interests, it is proposed to establish a National Textile Vocational School in Wuxi or Zhengzhou, with special emphasis on the research of rayon. This would facilitate student practice and meet the needs of the local area (to be completed in the first year of the period of political tutelage).</p>
<p>Third National Paper-Making Vocational School: The fifth plan in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan, specifically the section on the printing industry, states: "Currently, the paper used by Chinese newspapers is all imported from foreign countries. Paper is an important tool for disseminating culture. China has many raw materials for paper making, such as the natural forests in the northwest and the reeds near the Yangtze River, which can all be used as excellent paper materials." There was a former paper mill in Chenjiaji, Hubei. The National Paper-Making Vocational School should be established there.</p>
<p>Fourth National Mining and Metallurgy Vocational School: Mining and metallurgy are fundamental industries and the primary drivers of material civilization and economic progress. Our country is richest in mineral resources in the southwest, with Yunnan being particularly abundant in copper, iron, silver, and tin. A National Mining and Metallurgy Vocational School should be established in Kunming (to be completed in the second year of the period of political tutelage).</p>
<p>Fifth National Shipbuilding Vocational School: The third plan in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan, specifically the section on establishing shipyards, states: "With China's cheap labor and abundant materials, construction should be cheaper than in foreign countries. Besides the naval fleet, we also need to build a large fleet of inland river shallow-water vessels and fishing boats. It is not easy to transport such small boats across the ocean on ships. Therefore, foreign shipyards cannot build these types of vessels for us. China must at this time have its own shipyards to build its own shallow-water vessels and fishing fleets." Shanghai is a major international trading port and the gateway to the Yangtze River. It already has shipyards available for student practice. Therefore, it is proposed to establish a National Shipbuilding Vocational School there.</p>
<p>Sixth National Aircraft Manufacturing Vocational School: French General Foch stated, "The world wars of the future will be decided in the air." Dr. Sun Yat-sen also issued a decree on national salvation through aviation, highlighting the importance of the aviation industry to national defense. In terms of transportation, airplanes have the same functions as trains and ships, but their speed is ten times faster. Facilitating communication and saving time are both important. Our country's aviation industry is just beginning to emerge, and the demand for airplanes will increase as it gradually expands. Therefore, it is proposed to establish an Aircraft Manufacturing Vocational School in Pukou, with an attached automobile manufacturing department (to be completed in the third year of the period of political tutelage).</p>
<p>Seventh National Reclamation and Colonization Vocational School: Colonizing Mongolia and Xinjiang is mentioned in the third section of the first plan in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan: "If we can implement our colonization policy using scientific methods, the results will be unparalleled." The northwest frontier is desolate and in urgent need of development. High schools specializing in reclamation and colonization should be established locally as a pioneering effort for colonization. A National Reclamation and Colonization Vocational School would be most suitable for establishment in Dihua.</p>
<p>Eighth National Animal Husbandry Vocational School: The livestock produced in Mongolia, such as cattle, sheep, camels, and horses, are of excellent quality and in large quantities. A recent survey of the three provinces of Inner Mongolia, Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan shows that they produce 484,500 jin of camel wool, 260,100 jin of sheep wool, 27,020 cow hides, 10,910 horse hides, and 72,800 sheep skins. In addition, they also produce 60,000-70,000 jin of cashmere and over 100,000 jin of fox fur. All of these are raw materials for the wool textile and leather industries, and Suiyuan has plans to establish wool and leather factories. However, to develop the wool and leather industries, fundamental improvements in the animal husbandry industry are needed. If natural pastures can be utilized and scientific guidance can be provided, our country's animal husbandry industry can easily compete with the United States and Australia. Therefore, it is proposed to establish a National Animal Husbandry Vocational School in Suiyuan, with attached wool weaving and leather making classes (to be completed in the fourth year of the period of political tutelage).</p>
<p>Ninth National Fisheries Vocational School: Our country's territorial waters, in addition to producing shrimp, crabs, scallops, dried razor clams, shark fins, sea cucumbers, mussels, lizard skin, abalone, and various fish and turtles, also produce precious items such as conch shells and tortoiseshells. Unfortunately, ineffective fishing methods have allowed Japanese fishermen to dominate coastal fisheries. Our fishermen lack knowledge and are facing a dire situation. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan calls for the establishment of 31 fishing ports along the Chinese coast, from Andong near the Korean border to Qinzhou near the Vietnamese border, averaging one port every 100 miles of coastline. This would complete China's fisheries plan. To revitalize fisheries education and cultivate fisheries talent, relying solely on existing fisheries vocational schools is insufficient. A National Fisheries Vocational School should be established in Qingdao (to be completed in the fifth year of the period of political tutelage).</p>
<p>Tenth National Industrial Vocational School: Material construction depends on machinery. A complete industrial vocational school must be established to manufacture machinery independently. Switzerland, with a small area and a population of only a few million, has a renowned complete industrial vocational school in Zurich. It is divided into eleven departments: architecture and civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, chemistry, pharmacy, forestry, agriculture and rural engineering, mathematics and science teacher training, natural sciences, and military science. There are also optional general courses: Category A includes literature, history, philosophy, economics; Category B includes mathematics, natural sciences, engineering, and military science. German, French, or Italian language classes are also offered. Our country should establish a similar complete industrial vocational school in Chongqing, although the departments need not be as extensive and complex (to be completed in the sixth year of the period of political tutelage).</p>
<h3>My Hope for the Entire Church (Lu Shaoji)</h3>
<p>The various educational plans discussed at this National Education Conference in our country are in accordance with the educational aims of the Republic of China, as resolved by the Third National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang: "The education of the Republic of China, based on the Three Principles of the People, aims to enrich the people's lives, support social survival, develop the national economy, and perpetuate the nation's life, striving for national independence, universal civil rights, and economic development, to promote world harmony." - Dr. Sun Guiding.</p>
<p>We can say that this is similar to the aims of the "World Education Conference" initiated by the National Education Association of the United States in 1923. The aims of the World Education Conference are "to seek cooperation in international education, disseminate educational information from various countries, promote goodwill among nations, and enhance world peace," also seeking world harmony.</p>
<p>However, the purpose of my writing this article is not to compare this National Education Conference with the World Education Conference, but to express three hopes for this National Education Conference:</p>
<p>(1) Since the aims of this National Education Conference in our country are the same as those of the World Education Conference, this conference seems to have both internal and external aspects. It must not only find ways to improve Chinese education but also promote world education. Therefore, I hope that the education experts attending the conference will pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>(1) How can we exchange educational books, newspapers, and dissertations with educational institutions and experts in various countries?</p>
<p>(2) How can we exchange teachers with various countries, and what should be the methods for subsidizing students studying abroad?</p>
<p>(3) Should we use school textbooks to disseminate the national conditions and ideals of various countries?</p>
<p>(4) Should we advocate the establishment of an "International Education Institute" to unite world education?</p>
<p>(5) Should we jointly organize a "World Goodwill Association" with various countries, dedicated to promoting friendly relations among nations?</p>
<p>Performance by the Southeast Women's Physical Education School</p>
<p>Photographed by Guanghua, Nanjing</p>
<p>(2) Our country was founded on the Three Principles of the People. Although we are now in the period of political tutelage, there are still few Westerners who sympathize with us. The reason for this is that our people have not worked hard to promote our ideas abroad, and all books about Party doctrines are in Chinese, which foreigners cannot read. Therefore, I cannot help but hope that our country's education authorities will quickly send several copies of the "English San Min Chu I" (San Min Chu I), published by the Commercial Press and translated by Mr. F.W. Price and Mr. He Bingsong, to foreign governments, educational institutions (such as educational administrative bodies and university libraries in various countries), and education experts, so that Westerners who do not know Chinese can also learn about the doctrines created by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and sympathize with us.</p>
<p>(3) Foreigners are currently isolated from news about our country (only knowing that we have military activities). Therefore, I hope that our country's education authorities will translate the resolutions of this National Education Conference into English or other languages and, in addition to sending several copies to educational institutions and experts in various countries, our representatives must bring them to the next World Education Conference and read them in the conference hall, hoping to popularize the education of the Three Principles of the People in the world and realize the advocacy of "World Harmony."</p>
<p>Leaders of the education community, will you consider my humble opinion as acceptable?</p>
<h3>Fourth Day of the National Scout General Review</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Paying Respects at the Mausoleum... Today, Closing Ceremony</p>
<p>▲ All Scouts Pay Respects at the Mausoleum</p>
<p>The Line Extended Over Four Li</p>
<p>Presided Over by Dai Jitao</p>
<p>At 7:00 AM, all scouts departed from the military officer training camp, and it took until 8:00 AM for the departure to be completed. They walked along Zhongshan Road, with the line extending over four li. By 10:30 AM, all had arrived at the mausoleum. The heads of each troop, staff members, and scout service personnel were arranged in twelve lines in the memorial hall. The scouts from each troop were arranged in front of the memorial platform to pay their respects. The ceremony was presided over by Dai Jitao, Minister of the Central Training Department, with Zhao Genyao as the master of ceremonies. The Liangjiang Girls' Scouts and the Poor Children's Home orchestra played music and sang the Party song. The presiding official presented a wreath, and all saluted Dr. Sun Yat-sen's portrait with the highest respect. The presiding official reverently read Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, and all read it aloud in unison, followed by twenty-three minutes of silence. They sang the Scout song, and then Dai Jitao, Liu Luyin, Zhang Daofan, and Shi Weihuan, the director of the office, led all in viewing the remains. The viewing was completed around 1:00 PM. Finally, Dai Jitao summoned the service personnel from each troop in front of the tomb and delivered a very sincere speech.</p>
<p>▲ Commemoration Week Held</p>
<p>| Dai Jitao's Report |</p>
<p>Encouraging Aspiration to Build a Strong Nation</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM on the 20th, after paying respects at the mausoleum, the scouts gathered in front of the memorial platform to hold a commemoration week. Chairman Dai delivered a report, stating in essence: "Today, we have gathered scouts from all over the country to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum. We all sincerely and unanimously commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen. You must know that our China, our Chinese nation, has been unfortunate for many years. In the past century, we have suffered great oppression and bullying from imperialists. It was Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution that overthrew the oppressive Manchu government and created the Republic of China, a national state for all Chinese people. Our country is still under construction. All social organization, training, and material construction must be created from now on, like steps, stepping up one by one to achieve excellence. To complete an excellent country, we need all the people to be united, and each generation must be stronger than the last. Only through continuous efforts over ten or a hundred years can we create a glorious and brilliant nation and an excellent national culture. This responsibility rests entirely on you, little sisters and brothers. Your new responsibility is very important. You must unite, train well in all aspects of spirit, physical strength, intelligence, and morality, so that when you go out into society, no matter what occupation you are in, whether agriculture, industry, or commerce, you will be leaders of those who have not had the opportunity to receive education, and only then can you achieve your goals. Today, as we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen here, we must aspire to be a truly strong nation." After speaking, he led all in shouting slogans, took photos, and dispersed.</p>

<h3>Establishment of the Chinese Textile Institute</h3>
<p>▲ Aim: To Seek Progress in Technology and Management</p>
<p>The Chinese Textile Institute, organized by textile experts from across the country, held its inaugural meeting at No. 80 Avenue Édouard VII, Shanghai, on the afternoon of the 20th of this month, after three months of preparation. More than 120 members from Shanghai, Nantong, Haimen, Wuxi, Changzhou, Jiujiang, Hankou, and other places attended. The Municipal Training Association specially sent Mr. Xu Yefu to attend and provide guidance. Mr. Zhu Xianfang, the chairman, presided over the meeting, and after formal opening rites, the chairman delivered an opening speech, stating that China's modern textile industry has a history of 43 years. However, imports of foreign textile products continue to increase year by year, which is a deep shame for those of us engaged in the textile industry. The reason why China's textile industry lags behind to this extent is that technical personnel have never been united, and there have been few opportunities for research and discussion. Now, driven by our conscience, we have gathered loyal individuals to form this institute to seek progress in technology and management. We hope that all members will work together with one heart and one mind to plan progress, bearing obligations without rights, and that we can reap satisfactory results in the future. Next, Mr. Zhang Diesheng, a member of the preparatory committee, reported on the preparatory process. Afterwards, Mr. Xu Yefu, the representative of the Party Department, and Mr. Qian Yongli, the representative of the textile department of Nantong University, delivered speeches, mostly offering words of encouragement. At this point, the constitution was discussed and resolutions were made article by article, and a declaration was issued, stating the institute's mission. Subsequently, Zhu Xianfang, Zhu Gongquan, Wang Fuli, Zhang Diesheng, Huang Bingkui, Lu Shaoyun, Wu Xiangzhi, Huang Yunqiu, Su Jiquan, Gong Yinshan, Ren Liqing, Chen Zhongjie, Qian Changshi, Yang Yutian, and Si Zuozhou, fifteen people in total, were elected as executive committee members. Wang Zisu, Shen Yanmou, Chen Shouyi, Yuan Zhongqi, and Liu Daoqiu, five people, were elected as alternate committee members. The representative of the Party Department then administered the oath and announced their assumption of office. A group photo was taken and a meal was held in commemoration. This was truly the first grand gathering of textile experts from across the country.</p>

<p>(2) Japan Encourages the US and Australia to Join</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Games Rules Committee held a meeting at 7:00 PM on the 16th of this month at the Association's office in the Yaesu Hotel in Tokyo. Dr. Kish Kiyoshi, the president, chaired the meeting. Committee members Yamamoto, Noguchi, Sawada, Takashima, Yakushiji, and others attended. All the rules of the Games were discussed in detail. Seeing the gradual development of sports in China, Japan, and the Philippines, it was decided to expand the scope of the Games in the future and try to encourage the United States and Australia to join at the next Games. The name "Far Eastern Games" may not be practical in the future and should be changed to "Pan-Pacific Games." Japan decided to propose this suggestion at the upcoming tripartite meeting.</p>
<p>(3) Increased Strength of the Japanese Football Team</p>
<p>The strength of the Japanese football team has indeed greatly increased. Previously, they defeated the British warship HMS Woolwich (transliteration) of the Royal Navy 2-1 in Shanghai. This time, it cruised to Japan and docked in Yokohama. The Japanese football representatives participating in the Games, wanting to know the strength of our country, challenged the victorious British warship. The match was held at the Yokohama High School of Commerce ground at 1:00 PM on the 16th of this month. As a result, they drew 1-1. Japan is very proud of this, claiming that the British warship that defeated China could not defeat Japan. Through indirect comparison between China and Japan in football, Japan is superior to China.</p>
<p>(4) Holding a Japanese Traditional Swimming Competition</p>
<p>The Japan Swimming Federation has decided to add a public competition of Japanese traditional swimming to this Games. Therefore, it has hired many masters of traditional swimming schools. Those who have agreed to perform include the Mito Shinpa, Kobori, Mukai, Noshima, Iwakura, Tanouchi, and Kankai schools, eight schools in total. They will give public performances for thirty minutes every day from May 18th to May 31st. This type of sport will also be included in the program.</p>
<p>(5) Shortage of Baseball and Tennis Athletes in the Philippines</p>
<p>According to news from the Philippines, the representatives of the Philippine Islands for this Far Eastern Games were selected through the Carnival Athletics Meet in February of this year. Now that the Games are approaching, athletes from all over are gathering in Manila to prepare for intense training. Unexpectedly, there are difficulties in the baseball and tennis events due to the issue of participation. In early March, the Philippine Athletic Federation conducted a detailed review of the athletes in each event and then announced the names and teams of the representatives in the local newspapers. Two teams were selected as baseball representatives: the University of the Philippines and the Manila Student Association. Although these two teams are champions in the Philippines, their strength is too poor. Although our country's baseball is still immature, the Philippines' baseball is even worse than ours. Therefore, in every Games, the Philippine Islands are always defeated by our country. These two teams lack strong players, and recently many team members have requested leave. In addition, there is a shortage of coaching talent. Knowing that the outcome is important, the two teams jointly issued a statement to the Philippine Athletic Federation stating that they could not participate in the Games. It is said that there is still no solution to this matter, and the future is difficult to predict. Also, the tennis athletes who participated in the previous Games were the Holucson brothers. This year, the Holucson brothers were selected again. Both of them work for the railway bureau. Whether they can participate at that time depends on whether the railway bureau can grant permission. After these two incidents occurred, the Philippines was deeply worried, which is a sign of an unfortunate future. The reason is that the Philippines' selection of athletes is different from that of China and Japan. Except for track and field athletes, who are all students, the other athletes are not limited to professions. Therefore, the athletes selected this time are mostly employees of companies or shops, including Americans and Spaniards. (April 17th)</p>
<p>(6) Top Filipino Swimmer Breaks Off</p>
<p>The Philippine swimming representatives, a total of forty-nine candidates, had a final selection last week. Nine Moros were selected as official athletes because their performance was the best, excelling in the 50-meter, 100-meter, 400-meter, and 1500-meter freestyle. During the competition, the Filipinos' judging was unfair to them. Therefore, they sent a protest letter to the Philippine Athletic Federation, requesting the Athletic Federation to apologize, but it was rejected. The nine were enraged and announced their withdrawal from the Philippine delegation and could not participate in the Games. The Philippine Islands lost these nine top swimmers. Japan will dominate the swimming championships.</p>

<h3>Results of the Courage Group in the Shanghai Municipal No. 1 Sports Field Industrial and Commercial Amateur Football League</h3>
<p>▲ Finals Between Huxi and Asia on the 26th</p>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Amateur Football League, sponsored by the Shanghai Municipal No. 1 Public Sports Field, has been holding group matches for two months. Among them, the Courage Group, with the strongest fighting power, has completed a round-robin competition as of the 20th of this month. According to the accumulated results, Huxi and Asia are the best, each scoring fifteen points. According to the rules, they should have a final to determine the championship. The final will be held at 3:40 PM on the 26th of this month. When the two meet again, there will be a fierce battle. As for the spirit of the group competition, Lianhua is the best. Although they have been defeated repeatedly, they are always on time. Moreover, the team members live in the Yangshupu area, which is far from the field. They are never late for the 7:30 AM matches, which is particularly admirable. The French Electric team won the Industrial Group championship in the first competition last year. This year, they did not show amazing skills. Later, they forfeited due to circumstances, which is a pity. The Lingnan team also forfeited twice. At first, most team members could not spare time due to business reasons. Then, all the team members went to the Chinese Football Field to watch another group of players play against the strong team Qianghua. The amateur team has complete talent and has hope for the championship. However, when they fought against the strong enemy Huxi, the key players were absent, and they suffered a disastrous defeat, losing all their previous efforts. Later, they also forfeited once due to circumstances. The results of each team in the group are recorded below.</p>

<h3>Changshu's Ban on Rice Exports Hinders the Food Supply of Shanghai Citizens</h3>
<p>▲ The Municipal Government Cables the Jiangsu Provincial Government to Order the Lifting of the Ban</p>
<p>The Changshu County Government, under the pretext of a rice shortage, has banned the export of rice. The Joint Association of Rice Merchants in the Ningbo-Shanghai Cities and Counties of Jiangsu Province believes that this affects the source of rice for the city and has requested the municipal authorities to cable the Jiangsu Provincial Government to order the county to immediately lift the ban to maintain the people's food supply. Yesterday, it was learned that the municipal government has sent a cable to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to order the county to immediately abolish the measures banning rice exports. The original cable stated: "To the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Zhenjiang: According to the report of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Joint Association of Rice Merchants in the Ningbo-Shanghai Cities and Counties of Jiangsu Province, including Ye Huijun, has reported that Changshu has banned the export of rice, obstructing the source of rice for the city, and requested that the report be forwarded to the Municipal Government, which would then forward it to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to order the lifting of the ban to maintain the people's food supply. It is noted that this year's rice production is poor, and there is fear of a food shortage. Shanghai is not a rice-producing area and relies on neighboring counties to help each other in times of urgency to stabilize the rice market and avoid social unrest. According to a letter from the Changshu Rice Merchants Association, a member of the association, the county government, under the name of relieving the rice shortage, has decided to ban the export of rice, and those who violate the ban will be intercepted and punished. If this resolution is implemented, not only will rice merchants in the county have no business to do, but the city's food supply will also be affected. If other counties follow suit, the source will be cut off, and how can the people survive? Looking ahead, we cannot help but shudder. Therefore, we specially request your review and forwarding to the Municipal Government, which would then forward it to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to order the county government to lift the ban immediately to maintain the people's food supply. According to this, it is noted that maintaining the circulation of grain within the country and prohibiting the hoarding of grain in domestic producing areas have long been ordered by the National Government to be followed by the provincial and municipal governments. According to your government's instruction No. 4040, in accordance with the order of the Executive Yuan, the Central People's Food Committee has replied to the review, and the problem of the people's food supply during the period of food scarcity in the city this year is also treated as a temporary measure, which is nothing more than circulating domestic grain to increase its source and prohibiting the export of grain overseas to curb its flow. If the local governments can strictly follow the two points of prohibiting hoarding and prohibiting private exports overseas, the food supply of Shanghai citizens will gradually increase. Now, the Changshu County Government, under the name of relieving the rice shortage, has banned the export of rice, which is in conflict with the central laws and regulations and greatly affects the city's food supply. Therefore, we specially request your Excellency to promptly cable the Jiangsu Provincial Government to order the Changshu County Government to immediately abolish the measures banning rice exports to maintain the food supply of the city, and we hope for a cable reply. We await with anticipation." The Shanghai Special Municipal Government (seal).</p>
<h3>Rice Merchants Manipulating Imported Rice</h3>
<p>▲ The Social Affairs Bureau Forbids Futures Trading</p>
<p>Recently, the market price of imported rice has continued to rise. The reasons for this are unknown to outsiders. Therefore, the findings of the investigation are recorded in detail below for the attention of those who are concerned about the people's food supply.</p>
<p>▲ Imported Rice Futures Trading The Shanghai Chinese Miscellaneous Grains, Oils, and Cakes Exchange originally planned to open trading in imported rice futures this spring, but because it did not obtain the approval of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, it changed to trading in the Miscellaneous Grains Association Market. Although there was no official auction in form, the buying and selling between the two parties was like a newly opened imported rice exchange. The Social Affairs Bureau did not pay attention at first and allowed it to operate freely, which led to general merchants, relying on their great economic power, buying in large quantities. For example, if you buy 100 tons of imported rice, you only need to pay a deposit of 1,000 taels. After a few months, the price of rice rises, and you can sell it off, netting 1,000 taels. Therefore, people outside the industry also believe that it is a shortcut to get rich. Seeing the continued soaring prices, they buy in early, hoard it, and wait for the price to rise. Those who have bought goods at low prices are already satisfied and have made a fortune by settling the transactions one after another. In recent months, the Chinese have all been long-term buyers, and the sellers have all been foreign merchants. Because the purchasing power of Chinese merchants is strong, prices have been rising steadily. However, the futures trading of imported rice in the public market has not decreased due to high prices. However, the use of a customer's purchase is entirely hoarding, not real sales. The rice market is a short-selling relationship, and it has soared. The highest price of No. 1 native rice has reached 22 yuan. As a result, the common people are suffering, while speculative rice merchants are making huge profits.</p>
<p>▲ The Prohibition Order of the Social Affairs Bureau It is now heard that the Social Affairs Bureau has found that the Miscellaneous Grains Association is suspected of manipulating and monopolizing the imported rice market. Therefore, yesterday, the association was ordered to stop new futures trading from today. The order is recorded below: "Order to comply. It is noted that the market price of imported rice has continued to rise recently, which has a significant impact on the livelihood of the common people. The director of this bureau has instructed Mr. Ye Huijun, the representative of the Equal Price Committee, to inform all his colleagues to temporarily suspend the resale of imported rice futures in order to avoid disrupting the market. It is hereby ordered that the association must earnestly warn its colleagues to comply and not to resell imported rice futures again, otherwise they will be severely punished. It is also necessary to find ways to stabilize the market price in order to maintain the people's food supply. You must report the compliance to be reviewed. This is of utmost importance." The merchants who depend on imported rice for their livelihood are worried. However, the spot goods of imported rice on the third floor of the association are naturally trading as usual. Regarding futures trading, it is heard that it is still being done secretly, but in smaller quantities. The spot market has been sluggish as a result.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Long-Distance Telephone</h3>
<p>▲ Trial Call Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Business to Begin Within Days</p>
<p>The long-distance telephone line between Shanghai and Hangzhou, built by the Ministry of Communications, started construction last winter and has been completed as of yesterday. In addition to the two pairs of copper telephone lines, two direct telegraph lines have also been added. In the future, communication between Shanghai and Hangzhou will be more convenient than before. Yesterday, engineers from the Hangzhou Telegraph Bureau and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau conducted a trial call, and the sound was very clear. It is heard that business will begin within one or two days. The long-distance telephone exchange is located in the Hangzhou Telegraph Bureau. The price list is as follows:</p>
<p>To Hangzhou</p>
<p>Chang'an 35 cents</p>
<p>Jiaxing 40 cents 65 cents</p>
<p>Songjiang 40 cents 70 cents 95 cents</p>
<p>Shanghai 35 cents 65 cents 95 cents 1.10 yuan</p>
<p>Shanghai Concession 5 cents 40 cents 70 cents 1.00 yuan 1.20 yuan</p>
<p>Nanxiang 10 cents 5 cents 40 cents 70 cents 1.00 yuan 1.20 yuan</p>
<p>Wusong 15 cents 15 cents 10 cents 45 cents 75 cents 1.05 yuan 1.25 yuan</p>
<p>This is the provisional price list for the Shanghai-Hangzhou long-distance telephone. The prices for Xiashi and Jiashan have not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang's First Group of Immigrants to Leave Tomorrow</h3>
<p>▲ Approximately 800 People</p>
<p>Zhejiang Immigrants Head to Northeast to Cultivate Wasteland: The Zhejiang provincial government sent personnel to Shanghai to negotiate shipping arrangements with various shipping companies. The first group of immigrants is scheduled to depart for the Northeast, with the original plan to have them arrive in Liaoning by the end of this month. Over 300 people have already arrived in Shanghai. This matter has been reported repeatedly in this newspaper. Now, further details are provided below:</p>
<p>▲ Guangli to Go to Wenzhou for Transport: Most of the immigrants from Zhejiang province heading to the Northeast are from Wenzhou, Linhai, Yongjia, and other counties in eastern Zhejiang. According to reports from various counties, most are gathering in Wenzhou and have been arriving in succession. Yesterday, Zhou Botong, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Government responsible for this matter in Shanghai, received a telegram from Wenzhou stating that all the immigrants had arrived and requesting that a ship be sent immediately to transport them. Zhou then consulted with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The company's business department relayed a telegram to the Guangli vessel, which was returning to Shanghai from Guangdong, instructing it to also call at Wenzhou today to transport this group of immigrants to Shanghai. It is estimated that they will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow.</p>
<p>▲ Initial Group's Number of Passengers: The Zhejiang government initially planned to send 1,500 people in the first batch. Therefore, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company originally intended to dispatch a dedicated ship to Wenzhou to directly load them and transport them to Yingkou for disembarkation. However, according to the telegram, the number of people reported from various counties only amounts to 60% of the original quota. In addition to the over 300 people who have already arrived, only about 500 more will be transported from Wenzhou to Shanghai tomorrow. The total will be only about 800 people leaving for the Northeast. It is expected that they will arrive in Yingkou on the 27th of this month. The Zhejiang provincial government has already telegraphed the Liaoning provincial government, requesting them to send personnel to take care of them upon arrival.</p>
<p>▲ Immigrants Leave Shanghai Tomorrow: The Huayang vessel, designated by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to transport the immigrants to Yingkou, was originally scheduled to depart today. However, because the over 500 people carried by the Guangli vessel will not arrive in Shanghai today, the departure has been postponed for one day. They will wait in Shanghai, and once the immigrants are loaded onto the ship on the 23rd, they will sail directly to Yingkou. As the Zhejiang provincial government is facing economic difficulties, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is offering free ship tickets for the immigrants traveling to Liaoning. Only a portion of the food expenses for each person will be collected. Additionally, the Zhejiang provincial government is requested to provide a partial subsidy for the ship's coal expenses. This matter has been agreed upon and will be handled accordingly.</p>
<h3>Another Large Group of Chinese Citizens in Japan Expelled</h3>
<p>The Japanese Consulate in Shanghai previously stated that Japan had no intention of excluding Chinese citizens. However, in recent days, numerous groups of Chinese laborers and merchants going to Japan have been expelled and sent back to China, totaling over 20 people. Among them are Cai Yuting, Ling Hansheng, Chen Lifa, and Cheng Keming, who were in the restaurant business and were heading to Kobe. However, they were stopped by the Japanese Maritime Police because they did not have entry permits. They were detained overnight and then sent back to Shanghai on the original ship. There are also He Xuanzhou, Chen Jinhe, Lin Youxiang, Hua Xinfu, and others who were detained in Osaka and sent back to Shanghai. Furthermore, Lin Jingshi, Chen Changji, and others were stopped in Nagoya and sent back to Shanghai. Even more, Huang Liudu, Wei Dongsong, Guo Zhoufu, Lin Songyuan, Xu Yindong, Weng Rengui, Zhang Dezheng, Lin Kongyin, and thirteen others were sent back from Tokyo. Moreover, two Fujianese people, Weng Youtian and Wang Jiajian, who secretly went to Japan, were discovered by the Japanese police in Nagasaki and also escorted to Shanghai. According to the Japanese side, Weng and Wang allegedly set up schemes in China to defraud Chinese people of money, claiming they could guarantee the entry of Chinese people into Japan. Many people were deceived and paid protection fees. After obtaining these funds, Weng and others secretly fled to Japan, but were unexpectedly discovered by the Japanese police. However, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of this information, as it comes from the Japanese.</p>
<h3>German Industrial Delegation Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ To Visit Hangzhou Soon</p>
<p>The German industrial inspection delegation, which recently went from Shanghai to Beijing for sightseeing and to inspect various industries, departed Beijing on the 19th for Zhenjiang to visit Guanyinge. They were fully hosted by the Jiangsu provincial government. That evening, they took a train to Wuxi, toured various scenic spots, and inspected the silk and yarn industries. Yesterday (the 21st), they took an early express train from Wuxi to Qishuyan, visited the electric light factory and the Huacheng Yarn Factory, and then took the express train from Beijing to Shanghai at 5:20 PM, arriving at the North Station at 9:25 PM. All members of the delegation are staying at the Cathay Hotel. They are expected to travel from Shanghai to Hangzhou for sightseeing in the next few days.</p>
<h3>Special Meeting of Foreigners</h3>
<p>▲ To Be Held at 5:30 PM on May 2nd</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Council Officially Announces the Gathering Today</p>
<p>A previous report stated that influential foreigners in this port, in order to correct the rejection of the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors on the Municipal Council at last Wednesday's annual meeting of Western taxpayers, scheduled a special meeting. According to reliable sources on the foreign side, the special meeting has now been officially decided to be held at 5:30 PM on May 2nd (next Friday) in the Municipal Hall. The petition to convene the special meeting, led by the chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Marshall, and co-signed by sixty-one foreigners, has been submitted to Mr. Cunningham, the American Consul-General and Senior Consul. After another meeting of the Consular Body and the completion of formalities, it will be handed over to the Municipal Council for official announcement. It is rumored that the Municipal Council will announce the notice to foreigners today. It is said that there will be no problem meeting the quorum for the meeting on May 2nd. The proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors on the Municipal Council from three to five will be put forward by the chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Marshall, and its passage at that time can be predicted.</p>
<h3>Cooperation Between Chinese and French Police</h3>
<p>▲ To Facilitate Arrests</p>
<p>The Da Wan Bao reports that detectives from the Public Security Bureau of the Special Municipality will have more freedom to work in the French Concession in the future when arresting criminals. This was decided at a joint meeting between the heads of the Public Security Bureau and the officers of the French Concession's police station. The results of the meeting have not yet been announced, but it is said that both sides agreed to cooperate and facilitate each other in pursuing kidnappers and armed robbers in the future. As for searching the residences of bandits, a simple phone call for assistance will suffice, and there is no need to go to the police station or the Public Security Bureau to apply, in order to be swift and beneficial to police work.</p>

<h3>Military and Police Defense in May</h3>
<p>In view of the large number of commemorative days in May, the military and police authorities in this port believe that it is necessary to plan ahead for prevention. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters convened a meeting of the heads of military and police organizations yesterday to discuss defense measures. The general idea is to divide the responsibilities by period, increase the number of military and police personnel, maintain public security, and organize a secret service team by the Public Security Bureau, assisted by armed soldiers dispatched by the Garrison Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Customs Superintendent Liu Jiwen Assumed Office Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>▲ Inauguration Ceremony to Be Scheduled Separately</p>
<p>The newly appointed Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, Liu Jiwen, went to the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office on Xinzha Road at 10:00 AM yesterday morning (the 21st) to take over the duties. A separate inauguration ceremony will be held at a later date, with invitations sent to various sectors to attend. The details of yesterday's events are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Taking Over the Duties: Yesterday morning, Liu, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Xu Shuzhen, and former Secretary-General of the Nanjing Special Municipal Government, Qian Hong, Secretaries Yu Xijiu, Xu Tigang, and Long Gonglai, arrived at the office at around 9:00 AM. At 10:00 AM, they took over the duties in the main hall. The ceremony was very simple, and the former official delivered a speech, mainly encouraging all staff members and instructing them to work with peace of mind.</p>
<p>▲ Handing Over the Work: After taking over the duties, Liu supervised the four sections within the office—General Affairs, Accounting and Statistics, Taxation, and Navigation Administration—as well as the five offices of Inspection, Single Ticket, Accounting, Affairs, and Dispatch, to expedite the handover of work with the former official. He was extremely busy throughout the day.</p>

<h3>Japan and the United States Compete for Pacific Aviation Rights</h3>
<p>▲ Continue to Work Hard</p>
<p>▲ Six Osaka Ships Assigned: In order to compete in the Sino-US shipping industry, the Japanese Osaka Company built six new 9,000-ton oil-powered ships and assigned them to the Shanghai-New York route. The engine power of these six ships is extremely large. From Shanghai to New York, they can arrive within 35 days. The first ship will start its maiden voyage within August of this year and is currently being equipped with passenger seats. The six ships are named Di Hai Maru, Sanyo Maru, Kanto Maru, Kansai Maru, and the first one to start the route is Kinai Maru. Recently, the company has been planning to expand its export cargo business to the United States in Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other ports.</p>
<p>▲ Kawasaki Joins the Association: The current shipping competition in the Pacific is due to Japanese Kawasaki and other ships not joining the freight association. Therefore, they arbitrarily lower freight rates and are not bound by the association, causing lake silk freight rates to fall to one yuan per piece. Other goods are also reduced at will. British and American shipping companies in this port held several meetings to discuss countermeasures. It was agreed that the most appropriate fundamental solution was to persuade the Japanese company to join the association. However, after contacting them four times, there was no effect. It was confirmed yesterday that Kawasaki, after the fifth persuasion from British and American shipping companies, has agreed to join the Pacific Freight Association as a member. The company has 12 ships operating on the Pacific route. From now on, the company's freight rates cannot be increased or decreased freely and must be decided by the association through public discussion.</p>
<p>▲ The United States Increases New Ships: Since Nippon Yusen increased seven new ships in the Pacific this year, the US Maritime Commission believes that aviation rights are at stake and must be contested. It has been agreed that in the route from San Francisco to Shanghai, Qingdao, and other places, in addition to the original ships, it will add two more merchant ships that can travel at 14 knots per hour and carry 8,000 tons of cargo to expand to 17 trips per year. Also, in the route from San Francisco to Shanghai, including southern China, it will also speed up with two more merchant ships that can travel at 14 knots and carry 9,000 tons of cargo to expand to 19 trips per year and not allow the Japanese to gain exclusive advantages in transportation rights. Each new ship will be implemented starting next month.</p>
<p>▲ Latest News on Dollar's New Ships: In order to compete with British and Japanese shipping companies in the Sino-US shipping industry, American Dollar Steamship Lines built two large postal ships of 31,000 tons with 16 million US dollars. Construction began long ago, and one ship will be launched in August next year, specializing in the Shanghai-San Francisco route. The speed, cabin space, carrying capacity, etc. of each ship will exceed the three new ships of Nippon Yusen, such as Fushimi Maru. Each of the two ships is 653 feet long, 81 feet wide, and has a draft of 52 feet. It has 320 first-class rooms, 135 special-class rooms, and 800 third-class rooms. They are unprecedentedly large ships in the Pacific. The speed can reach 21 knots per hour. Two aircraft are also stationed on the ship for picking up and dropping off mail and passengers. The scale and beauty of the layout rank first among postal ships in the Far East.</p>
<h3>Jing'an Carries Navy Cadets to Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ Ninety-seven Qualified</p>
<p>▲ Scheduled to Depart for Fuzhou on the 23rd</p>
<p>The naval transport ship Jing'an arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Beijing, carrying ninety-seven naval cadets who are being sent to the Fuzhou Naval Academy for study. The ship arrived at the port at 6:00 PM yesterday and docked at the Wusongkou. According to a certain adjutant surnamed Zhang who came to Shanghai on the same ship, speaking to the Daily News reporter, the naval recruitment examination in Beijing this time attracted approximately one hundred and sixty candidates for naval navigation and machinery, recommended by various provinces, cities, and overseas Chinese. After the physical examination by the recruitment committee, a total of one hundred and fourteen candidates were deemed qualified. Last week, they completed examinations in subjects such as Chinese, English, and arithmetic. After the examination, the recruitment committee sealed the students' examination papers and submitted them for evaluation. Acting Minister Chen convened all committee members, including Zeng Yiding, Li Shijia, and Wu Zhennan, for a plenary meeting to assess and determine the qualified students, totaling ninety-seven. In addition to announcements in newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai, Acting Minister Chen specially convened the admitted cadets the day before yesterday for a speech in the auditorium of the ministry, offering many words of encouragement. The cadets, led by Jing'an ship captain Ouyang Ji, boarded the ship. Yesterday morning, they set sail from Beijing to Shanghai. Tomorrow morning (i.e., this morning), Captain Ouyang will lead them ashore to visit the Shanghai Naval Shipyard at Gaochang Temple in the Nanshi, inspecting various factories, including the casting machinery factory, repair factory, and various dry docks, providing guidance. They will also briefly point out the main points of casting at the nearby arsenal and gun factory. Without much delay in Shanghai, they are scheduled to be sent to the Fuzhou Naval Academy for five years of study on the original ship tomorrow (the 23rd). After graduation, they will be sent to Europe and the United States for further studies to deepen their expertise. The future of talent in the naval sector of our country is immeasurable.</p>
<h3>New Kang Ship Lawsuit Filed</h3>
<p>After the merchant ship New Kang was sunk by a Japanese ship, negotiations have been ongoing for a long time without a resolution. The bureau submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications, which was approved. After filing a lawsuit in the Shanghai Special District Local Court, the bureau immediately entrusted a lawyer to submit a petition to the court, initiating legal proceedings and demanding that the defendant, the Japanese Mail Steamship Company, compensate for a loss of one million yuan. This lawsuit was not accepted previously due to the reorganization of the court. Now, it has been formally accepted and approved for trial. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will notify the Japanese ambassador, ordering the company to appear in court for trial. The plaintiff has prepaid the litigation costs, which are guaranteed by Yu Qiaqing of the shipping association.</p>
<h3>Land Survey of Zhabei District Commences</h3>
<p>▲ Land Bureau Issues Notice to Landowners, Noting Four Points</p>
<p>The Municipal Land Bureau issued a notice yesterday, stating: "For the purpose of notification, the bureau is now beginning a land survey of households in the eleventh map of the twenty-seventh bao in the Zhabei District. Landowners should pay attention to the following items: (1) The land guarantor will distribute reporting forms to landowners. Landowners should truthfully fill them out within ten days of receiving the form, and the land guarantor will collect them and submit them to the Zhabei Survey Office of the bureau at the Xiajia Guanyintang on Qiujiang Road. (2) If the reporting form cannot be distributed due to the landowner's address being unknown, they can directly submit the filled form to the bureau or the survey office themselves. (3) If the landowner's land is mortgaged or pawned and they cannot fill in the name and acreage, they should promptly copy the information from the mortgagee or pawnbroker and not refuse to do so. (4) When the land of each household is measured, the landowner must, together with the land guarantor, clearly indicate the boundaries to the surveyor or measurement staff, or entrust a representative in advance to point out the boundaries on-site. Otherwise, the bureau will only rely on the land guarantor's instructions, and the landowner will be responsible for any errors or disputes that may arise in the future. The above four items are related to the consolidation of property rights for landowners and should be given special attention." This notice.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Cautious in Selecting Postal Personnel</h3>
<p>The Directorate General of Posts and the Directorate General of Postal Savings and Remittances received Instruction No. 1055 from the Ministry of Communications yesterday, stating: "For compliance, it is noted that postal affairs and postal savings and remittance affairs are now managed separately by publicly established directorates general in accordance with the methods of various countries. The postal commissioners, assistant postal commissioners, deputy postal commissioners, chief accountants, and directors of first-class post offices in each district bear significant responsibility for postal and postal savings and remittance affairs. Therefore, their performance should be evaluated by both parties to ensure thoroughness. Hereafter, the performance evaluation of these personnel should be handled conscientiously by both directorates general. Any promotions, advancements, transfers, appointments, acting positions, or dismissals must be submitted to the ministry for approval by both directorates general. Furthermore, postal savings and remittance affairs are now being vigorously expanded, and the responsibilities of the postal commissioners and deputy postal commissioners are particularly significant. Therefore, when postal personnel are promoted to postal commissioners or deputy postal commissioners, careful selection of talent is essential to ensure they can perform their duties satisfactorily. Hereafter, both directorates general should conduct detailed assessments and submit a list of names to the ministry for approval before any promotions can be made. As for the current postal commissioners, assistant postal commissioners, deputy postal commissioners, chief accountants, and directors of first-class post offices in each district who also handle savings and remittance affairs, both directorates general should submit a list of names to the ministry for review and additional appointment with specific responsibilities. In addition to separate orders, you are to comply accordingly and instruct all subordinates to comply as well."</p>
<h3>National Postal Union Petitions in Beijing</h3>
<p>▲ Seeking Central Government Clarification on Four Key Points</p>
<p>Lu Jingshi, Zhao Shusheng, Wang Shufan, and Wang Yisheng, standing committee members of the National Postal Workers' Union, believing that the central government has misunderstandings regarding the union's organizational process and future work direction, and that the explicit order to temporarily suspend the union's activities is detrimental to postal affairs, traveled to Beijing the day before yesterday to petition the Central Training Department for clarification. They presented four key points: (1) Due to the uniformity of treatment systems and other matters for postal workers nationwide, the organization of a National Postal Workers' Union is necessary to avoid local disputes and ensure unified management. (2) In accordance with the special union organization regulations resolved by the 154th session of the Second Central Executive Committee, a preparatory committee was established on December 1, 1929. Due to the urgency of time, the union was unable to register with the central government. A request for registration has been submitted, and it is hoped that the central government will understand and approve the registration. (3) The Seamen's General Union has already been established. Postal workers also belong to the transportation sector and should be allowed to organize by analogy. (4) The preparatory committee's attitude is open and its purpose is pure. The central government should provide support to prevent reactionary elements from seizing the opportunity and causing unexpected disputes. It is reported that the committee members' petition in Beijing was very successful and will be resolved soon.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Negotiates Against Heavy Tax on Parasols</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Jiangsu Finance Commissioner's Office and the Special Tax Bureau to negotiate against the heavy tax on parasols, stating: "Dear Sirs, On the 18th of this month, we received a letter from the Shanghai Special City Parasol Industry Consolidation Committee stating that the Huali Parasol Factory, a member of our committee, reported that at 5:00 PM on the 15th of this month, they shipped twenty dozen parasols to the Nanshi, intending to transport them to Haiyan. In accordance with past practice, they obtained a half-tax ticket from the Jiangsu Finance Department's Foreign Goods and Local Products Tax Bureau and a half-tax supplementary ticket from the Shanghai Tax Bureau's Nanshi Collection Office, which stated that the goods and ticket had been checked and verified by various tax offices and that an inspection certificate had been issued, exempting them from further taxation. However, the Cotton Special Tax Bureau, also under the Jiangsu Finance Department, suddenly sent people to seize the factory's parasols and refused to issue a receipt, demanding a fine of two yuan per dozen, totaling forty yuan. Our factory operates on a small scale and cannot afford this burden. This violates the principle of 'one item, one tax.' Considering that parasol raw materials include copper, iron, cotton, and wood, if each material is analyzed and taxed individually, domestic parasols will only face immediate bankruptcy. This runs counter to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood and the National Government's advocacy of industry. Therefore, we urgently submit this appeal and request that you forward it to the superior authorities for assistance in negotiating the return of the seized parasols and the cancellation of this overlapping tax to save the parasol industry from danger. This would be most fortunate. The document and tax ticket are enclosed. Based on this, we have investigated the tax payment method for domestic parasols transported from this city to other locations. In the past, they have obtained a half-tax ticket from the Jiangsu Finance Department's Foreign Goods and Local Products Tax Bureau and a half-tax supplementary ticket from the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau's Collection Office. After passing through various tax offices, they have been issued an inspection certificate and exempted from further taxation. This has been the established practice. Now that the Huali Parasol Factory has followed the established procedure, it should not be taxed again. Furthermore, the raw materials for parasols are made of cloth, iron, wood, etc., and taxes have already been paid at the Foreign Goods and Local Products Tax Bureau and the Goods Tax Collection Office. If they are also required to pay the cotton special tax, it would indeed be three or four taxes on one item, as the factory stated, leading to immediate bankruptcy. Taxing the only remaining domestic parasol industry with multiple taxes runs contrary to the purpose of protecting it. Moreover, the cotton special tax should apply to cotton textiles. If the parasols are taxed based solely on the cloth portion, then the fabric must have already been taxed by the piece goods merchant when it was woven and transported. There is no reason to pay the cotton special tax twice for the same cotton textile. If it is argued that parasols are a different type of item after being manufactured and cannot be compared to simple cotton textiles, then since parasols are not within the scope of the Goods Tax Office, there is no doubt that they are not under the jurisdiction of the Special Tax Bureau. Goods reported to the tax office are no longer subject to special taxes. This is a clear principle. Accordingly, we respectfully request that your office investigate and order the exemption from further taxation and the return of the twenty dozen seized parasols as soon as possible to protect domestic goods and relieve commercial difficulties. We eagerly await your response. Sincerely, To the Jiangsu Finance Commissioner's Office, the Jiangsu Special Tax Bureau's Cotton Special Tax Group."</p>

<h3>Kidnappers Use Guns in Broad Daylight</h3>
<p>▲ In the Busy Area of Xinza Road</p>
<p>▲ Kidnappers Abduct Tang Zairu</p>
<p>▲ Chauffeur Shot Twice While Protecting Master</p>
<p>▲ Mrs. Tang Terrified, Attempts to Jump from Building</p>
<p>Yesterday at 9:30 AM, near the intersection of Xinza Road, Kader Road, and Xifukang Lane in the French Concession, four kidnappers shot and wounded chauffeur Lu Yonglin and abducted his master, Tang Zairu from Huzhou. The kidnappers took both the person and the car. The details obtained from the investigation are described below.</p>
<p>▲ Tang Zairu Kidnapped Upon Leaving Home: Tang Zairu, also known as Tang Ji, is a forty-two-year-old native of Huzhou residing at No. 1, Alley 5, Xifukang Lane, Xinza Road, with the house number being 617 and a half. He goes out on business every day and is very busy. He owns a car, with the Concession Permit number 4514, driven by Lu Yonglin from Changzhou. Yesterday morning at 9:30 AM, it was time for Tang to go out for business, but he was unexpectedly met by kidnappers upon leaving his home.</p>
<p>▲ Chauffeur Attempts to Drive Away in Emergency: Tang's chauffeur, Lu Yonglin, has been driving for Tang for a long time. Every day at 9:00 AM, he cleans the car and parks it at the entrance of Xifukang Lane, ready for his master's business trips. Yesterday, he parked as usual. At 9:30 AM, chauffeur's assistant Pan Hongcai came out to inform him that the master was about to leave and to prepare the car. Lu agreed, opened the car door, and started the engine. At this moment, Tang came out and boarded the car. Unexpectedly, four people jumped out from the alley entrance, shouting for them to stop. One of the kidnappers pulled out a gun, scaring chauffeur's assistant Pan Hongcai to the ground. Seeing the situation was bad, Lu Yonglin engaged the gear, trying to drive away from the dangerous situation.</p>
<p>▲ Kidnappers Angrily Fire Guns: The four kidnappers knew Tang would leave at this time, so they pretended to be pedestrians and lingered at the alley entrance. When they saw Pan Hongcai announce that the master had arrived, the kidnappers were already prepared and ready to abduct him. Seeing chauffeur Lu Yonglin engage the gear and try to escape, they thought they would be easily given up on a piece of fat meat about to enter their mouths. In this critical moment, they glared fiercely, pulled out their guns, two of the kidnappers used their guns to monitor Tang's actions, and stopped him from making any noise. The other two aimed at Lu's head and fired. Seeing the bullets, Lu immediately lowered his head, and the bullets flew over his head, fortunately missing him. However, one of the kidnappers, seeing that the bullet was avoided, fired another shot, hitting Lu's left shoulder. The bullet passed through his back.</p>
<p>▲ Kidnappers Shout "Kidnapping" and Flee with Person and Car: The Xifukang Lane area is lined with shops and is adjacent to the Kader Road Triangle Market. Every morning, vendors and shoppers with baskets pass by, resembling the bustling scene of Shanyin Road. Pedestrians heard two gunshots and were wondering what was happening when they suddenly heard shouts of "Catch the kidnappers," with strained voices. Amidst the noise, the kidnappers forced the chauffeur into the middle seat and drove away quickly, heading east. Onlookers shouted "Kidnapping" and followed to the Kader Road intersection, where they saw the car head south and turn onto Rue Amiral Courbet, heading west. It is believed they fled to western Shanghai. At that time, the chauffeur's assistant saw that the kidnappers had gone far and dared to report to Tang's wife.</p>
<p>▲ Injured Man Abandoned in Wasteland: After the kidnappers took the person and car, chauffeur Lu Yonglin, although shot in the back, remained conscious but could not bear the pain and shouted for help. The kidnappers, fearing something would happen on the way, covered his mouth to prevent him from speaking. The hostage, Tang Zairu, was also squeezed tightly by two kidnappers, wearing dark glasses, and was not allowed to make any noise, otherwise he would be killed immediately. When the car reached the western part of Route Doumer, near Jing'an Temple, the area became desolate, with green trees and few pedestrians. The four kidnappers abandoned Lu Yonglin on the wasteland, got back in the car, and sped away.</p>
<p>▲ Sent to Hospital, Life in Danger: Chauffeur Lu Yonglin, after being abandoned on the wasteland of Route Doumer, shouted for help with all his might. However, due to his serious injuries, he could not walk. Later, a villager heard the sound and reported to the nearby patrol, who sent him to the Red Cross Hospital on Route Haig. Doctors performed surgery to remove the bullet. According to the doctor, his condition is quite dangerous. If there are no changes in two or three days, his life can be saved. The detectives from the Route Tenant de la Tour Police Station obtained a brief statement from him when he regained consciousness and learned about the kidnapping. They then telephoned the Gorden Road Police Station to conduct a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>▲ Mrs. Tang Suffers a Nervous Breakdown: When reporters arrived at Tang's residence to inquire, the family asked them not to make any noise because Mrs. Tang had suffered a nervous breakdown upon hearing the news, fearing she would jump out the window. According to the family, there were no prior threats or letters before Tang's kidnapping. He has no savings in his life, and others mistakenly believe he is wealthy because he owns a car, but the car was given to him by a friend. The family of four relies on him for their livelihood. His eldest daughter, age twenty-one, is studying at the Nanyang Girls' High School. His second daughter, age fourteen, is also studying with her sister. His son, age six, is still playing. His wife, surnamed Jiang, is thirty-seven years old and is suffering from a nervous breakdown.</p>
<p>▲ Empty Car Found in the French Concession: After Tang was kidnapped, the Gorden Road Police Station dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to conduct a detailed investigation. They also notified all police stations and the North and South Public Security Bureaus to pay attention to the car with the number 4514. At 5:30 PM, the French police telephoned the Gorden Road Police Station, saying that the empty car had been found on Rue Pére Froc. The car body was not damaged.</p>
<h3>Assistant Drives Car Without Permission, Leading to Uncontrollable Consequences</h3>
<p>Detailed Report on Automobile Accident Resulting in Six Deaths and Injuries</p>
<p>▲ Assistant Had No Driver's License</p>
<p>▲ Speeding Without Honking Horn</p>
<p>▲ A Major Tragedy Unfolds in an Instant</p>
<p>▲ Attempt to Abandon Car and Flee After the Accident</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported on a car accident resulting in multiple deaths and injuries. The following is a continuation of the detailed report on the accident and the court's interrogation yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ Tan Xinzhen's Car: After the reorganization of the Provisional Court, former Judge Tan Xinzhen has resumed his career as a lawyer. The afternoon before yesterday, as his eldest son's wedding was approaching, Tan hired his own car, number 3867, to go to the Yipinxiang Hotel on Tibet Road to book a room for the auspicious occasion. Upon arriving at the hotel, Tan got out of the car and went inside, instructing his chauffeur, Chen Xiaosi, to drive the car home.</p>
<p>▲ Car Becomes Uncontrollable: Chen drove the car to Zhejiang Road and got out to buy shoes, parking the car at the intersection of Tianjin Road, instructing his assistant, Zhang Cheng, to watch over it. Unexpectedly, Zhang drove off on his own, speeding excessively. As he drove along Tianjin Road and Guizhou Road, people scattered out of the way. Zhang had no driving experience, leading to uncontrollable consequences.</p>
<p>▲ Indeed, a Major Disaster Occurred: As a result of the speeding, one person, Jiang Bainian, was killed, and five people were injured: Zhu Peiyuan, Cai Shunheng, Jiang Changlin, Tang Desheng, and Cai's wife, Cai Abao. The Laozha Police Station sent detectives to arrest the culprit, Zhang Cheng, and the chauffeur, Chen Xiaosi, and took them to the police station. Jiang Bainian's body was taken to the coroner's office on Fielun Road.</p>
<p>▲ Life and Death Uncertain: Zhu Peiyuan and the others were sent to the hospital for treatment. After examination and medication by the doctors, Jiang Changlin's injuries were minor, and he was discharged from the hospital soon after. The remaining four suffered serious injuries. According to the doctors, it is difficult to predict whether there is any danger to their lives and must wait until Saturday of this week to be certain.</p>
<p>▲ Prosecution According to Criminal Law: Yesterday morning, the police, along with Jiang Changlin, escorted Zhang and Chen to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Sun Yuan presided over the first hearing. The police lawyer, Gan, presented the facts and charged them with causing death by injury under Article 291 of the Criminal Law and with injury under Articles 293 and 295. Zhang Cheng was also charged with violating Article 34 of the Municipal Council's regulations for driving without a license.</p>
<p>▲ Statement of the Chinese Constable: Subsequently, Chinese Constable No. 1103 reported the situation at the time, stating that he was on duty near the scene of the accident when he suddenly heard a crash and saw the defendant, Zhang Cheng, abandoning the car and fleeing from north to south, whom he caught.</p>
<p>▲ Speeding Without Warning Signal: Witness Zhao Boyi testified that he worked at a cigarette paper shop behind the Xian Shi Company and saw the car speeding from the north, knocking down a man, a woman, and a child in succession. Witness Hong Zaiyu testified that he was passing by and saw the defendant, Zhang Cheng, driving the car at high speed without honking the horn. In an instant, three people were knocked down.</p>
<p>▲ Report of the Western Constable: Western Constable No. 309 stated that yesterday afternoon at 4:40, he came out of the police station and passed by the area, where he saw a person trapped under the car, as well as an old man and a young man who were injured. Upon investigation, in addition to these three, two more people were injured, and one person was killed. The car had no driver in it at the time of the accident.</p>
<p>▲ Let It Go Where It Will: Judge Sun interrogated Chen Xiaosi, who confessed that he was from Jiangbei and worked as a chauffeur for the Tan Residence. Zhang Cheng was previously an apprentice and is now learning to be a driver with him and that this has lasted for three months. Zhang Cheng confessed that he was from Shandong and drove the car on Tianjin Road at 4:50 PM on the 20th. The car was originally driven by Chen, but since Chen stopped there, he slightly adjusted the machinery and unexpectedly the car drove off and he was unable to stop it, so he let it go where it will, feeling very flustered and causing the accident. He had not obtained a driver's license. Chen and Zhang both hired lawyers Fan Gang and Liang Bohua for their defense. Judge Sun then ordered Chen Xiaosi to provide a guarantee of 500 yuan from a reputable shop and remanded Zhang Cheng in custody, scheduling another hearing in seven days.</p>
<p>▲ Coroner's Examination of the Deceased: After ten o'clock, Court Inspector Guo visited the scene to examine Jiang Bainian's body. He interviewed the Western constable and Jiang Changlin, son of the deceased and injured at the same time, and inquired about the situation. He instructed Jiang to collect the body and make funeral arrangements. Accidents involving cars in Shanghai occur every day, so they are common sight, but an incident resulting in six deaths and injuries in a row is rare.</p>
<h3>Young Man Commits Suicide by Poisoning, Claiming Economic Oppression</h3>
<p>▲ Deceased Worked at Paris Dance Hall</p>
<p>▲ Fired for Embezzling Over a Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>▲ Lodged at the Oriental Hotel Before Death</p>
<p>▲ Visited by Prostitute</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, a suicide occurred at the Oriental Hotel on Tibet Road. The deceased was named Chen Kepei. On the morning of the 18th, Chen went alone to the Oriental Hotel and checked into Room 307, with no possessions. Later, a female guest visited him. According to the hotel attendant, she saw the female guest, whose appearance and behavior were very much like that of a prostitute. Chen and the female guest left together, and Chen returned alone in the afternoon. In the evening, before going to bed, there was nothing unusual. At 9:00 AM the next morning, the attendant entered Room 307 to clean and saw Chen lying stiffly on the bed, no longer breathing. He reported to the Laozha Police Station, who sent a detective to investigate. Two letters were found near the deceased, one addressed to Mao Yongchang, manager of the Paris Dance Hall, referring to Mao as "Master," and the other addressed to his parents. The letter stated that the suicide was entirely due to environmental and economic pressures. In addition, one yuan in silver, two dimes, and a gold watch, cigarette case, and other items were left behind. The detective took the body to the morgue on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, the Special District Local Court was requested to send Court Inspector Guo to the morgue to examine the body. It was not possible to determine what poison Chen Kepei had taken to cause his death. Mao Yongchang and others were summoned by the police. According to Mao, Chen was his student and was recently suspended due to embezzling more than a thousand yuan, while the details of the embezzlement were being investigated. He said that Chen's suicide was the result of his recklessness. Later, the Oriental Hotel attendant testified about Chen's lodging, and Wu Zhiwen arrived to state that the deceased was his cousin. Finally, the Western constable presented the letters, the gold watch, two yuan, and three empty opium boxes found near the deceased. Court Inspector Guo ordered the investigation to continue next Tuesday (today).</p>
<h3>Open-Air Meeting of Sixty or Seventy People on Vacant Land</h3>
<p>▲ Patrolmen Arrived and They Scattered in All Directions</p>
<p>▲ Six People Were Arrested and Leaflets Were Seized</p>
<p>▲ A Tram Window Was Smashed</p>
<p>▲ Interrogation Yesterday by the Higher Branch Court</p>
<p>In the vacant lot in front of the Sanxing Cotton Mill at 87 Yangshupu Road, at 9 a.m. the day before yesterday, a group resembling workers held an open-air meeting. The Municipal Public Security Bureau had received a report beforehand. As the location was in the foreign concession, they specifically notified the political department of the Chief Inspector's Office by telephone to take precautions to prevent reactionary elements from taking the opportunity to incite trouble. The Chief Political Department dispatched Western Detective Arok, along with Chinese Detective Zhang Yunjian, to investigate. Upon arrival, they saw sixty or seventy people gathered. Several people in Western suits and long gowns were leading them. As soon as these people saw the Chinese and Western detectives, they scattered in all directions and many fled. The detectives immediately arrested He Qingxiang from Sichuan, Yao Guanghua from Anhui, Li Longzhi from Beiping, Chen Jiaxing from Zhejiang, Yan Zhaotang from Ningbo, and Song Chaowei from the local area, a total of six people. They seized a bundle of leaflets filled with reactionary text and took them to the police station for detention. Because the case involved counter-revolution, they were specifically sent to the Second Tribunal of the Higher Branch Court yesterday morning, where Judge Ye Zaizhou opened a preliminary hearing. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated first that they could be prosecuted under Articles 103, 157, and 160, etc., of the Criminal Code. However, after the defendants were arrested, the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent a representative to the police station, requesting that they be transferred to the Public Security Bureau. The power to transfer rested with the court, so they were specifically brought to the court for review. No representative from the Public Security Bureau was present in court today. However, the case occurred and the arrests took place within the foreign concession, so the court had jurisdiction. Moreover, except for Yao Guanghua, who resided on Jiangxi Road, the rest lived in the Chinese area, so the inland authorities could also handle the case. If they insisted on taking them away, they should be handed over to the inland judicial authorities for a joint trial. Next, Western Detective Arok reported the circumstances of the defendants' arrest, stating that at 9:05 a.m. yesterday morning, they received a telephone report that communists were holding a meeting in front of the Sanxing Cotton Mill. He and the Chinese detectives rushed there and saw sixty or seventy people gathered on the vacant lot, holding a meeting. When the defendants Li Longzhi and the three people in Western suits saw them, they fled towards Lan Road. He gave chase for a long time and finally caught Li on Huaxing Road. The three men in Western suits had escaped towards the Chinese area. The other five defendants were arrested by the Chinese detectives. At 9:30 a.m., they received a telephone report from the British-American Tramway Company that a tram, which had passed in front of the Sanxing Cotton Mill before 9:30 a.m., had one of its window panes broken by the crowd with violence. The company had sent a representative to the case and could testify. Judge Ye then interrogated each of the defendants separately. They all denied the accusations. Later, a Westerner from the tram company made a few statements. The court ordered the defendants to be remanded to custody and rescheduled the hearing for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Gun and Ammunition Discovered by Chance</h3>
<p>▲ Due to Carrying a Large Sum of Money</p>
<p>▲ The One-Legged Bandit Was Alarmed by a Half-Price Ticket</p>
<p>On the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway express train from Shanghai to Hangzhou, at around 9 a.m., when soldiers were about to inspect passenger tickets at Longhua Station, they suddenly discovered a large sum of yarn tickets and military ammunition. The following is a summary of what was seen:</p>
<p>▲ Oil Factory Accountant Carrying a Large Sum of Money Yesterday, when the Shanghai-Hangzhou express train departed from Shanghai, an oil factory employee came to Shanghai and collected more than 4,000 yuan in cash. He boarded the train to return to Zhejiang. Unexpectedly, two bandits secretly carried two new-style pistols, each one foot and two inches long, and more than six hundred bullets, and boarded the same train.</p>
<p>▲ Child's Ticket Caused Alarm After the express train left Longhua Station, the ticket inspector proceeded to check passenger tickets one by one. When he reached the bandits who were carrying firearms, because the bandit was accompanied by a child over ten years old who had not purchased a ticket, the inspector instructed him to buy a supplementary ticket. One of the bandits suddenly became alarmed. The inspecting soldiers carried out a search and found a pistol and bullets on the one-legged bandit's waist (the bandit had only one leg and used a wooden crutch for support). After the two bandits were arrested, it was learned that they were following the person carrying the money.</p>
<p>▲ Bundles of Cash Wrapped Around the Waist The inspecting soldiers then summoned the person carrying the large sum of money and asked him to take the money out of the pouch around his waist. The person claimed to be an accounting employee of an oil mill, who came to Shanghai to collect accounts and was returning. However, he did not know the railway regulations and could not carry so much cash, etc. Therefore, the inspecting soldiers took the two arrested bandits, along with the person carrying the money, and all the seized military ammunition, to the authorities for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co. Initiates a Far East Travel School</h3>

<h3>Reconstruction of the Seeker Lighthouse at the Wusong Fortress</h3>
<p>Deng Zhenquan, the commander of the Wusong Fortress, considering that the original seeker lighthouse had low horsepower and insufficient range, and that it might not be effective during searches, ordered a new 25-horsepower German engine and transported it to the fortress. He then ordered the lighthouse to be rebuilt. It is now learned that the project is nearing completion. Yesterday afternoon, Commander Deng, accompanied by Chief of Staff Teng, went to inspect the site to review whether there were any improper installations, and ordered the project to be completed soon so that it could be tested.</p>
<h3>Approval of Priority Right of Way for Motor Vehicles on the Beihui Road</h3>

Hayashi Yūkich and Saito delivered congratulatory speeches. The meeting adjourned at 2 p.m.</p>
<h3>Women's Sightseeing Tour Group from Weiting Mountain Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Improving rural life requires improving peasant families as a key measure. The rural service department of the Weiting Mountain Youth Association, in view of this, specially organized a women's sightseeing tour group of fifteen people. They obtained a half-price discount from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Led by secretary Chen Ruzhen, they came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to sightsee, to increase their knowledge, invigorate their spirits, and enable them to innovate in everything after returning to their hometown. In addition to visiting scenic spots, the group specifically went to Pudong to visit the Youth Association's model worker village. The villagers prepared meals to welcome them. Yesterday, Mrs. Zheng Wei, a director of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, hosted a dinner to entertain them. Mr. Huang Chujiu also gifted them free tickets to visit the Great World, allowing them to enjoy the sights to their hearts' content. Today, they plan to visit a chicken farm and other places in Jiangwan.</p>
<h3>Dr. Bando Visits Shanghai-Hangzhou Leprosy Hospitals</h3>
<p>Dr. Bando, head of the leprosy section of the Health Department of the League of Nations, arrived in Shanghai on the President Cleveland on the morning of the 18th of this month from Tokyo. The afternoon before yesterday, Li Yuanxin, president of the China Leprosy Relief Association, Vice President Diao Xinde, Executive Secretary Wu Zhijian, and others invited him to visit the leprosy clinic at 173 Linping Road in the Hongkou Public Society, which the association had recently taken over. Dr. Bando expressed his approval of the clinic and said that such clinics are excellent tools for eliminating leprosy. However, Shanghai still needs a new-style leprosy hospital to provide accommodation. Dr. Bando visited the Guangji Leprosy Hospital in Hangzhou yesterday and returned to Shanghai immediately. He took the 11 o'clock overnight express train to Beijing to visit Minister of Health Dr. Liu Ruiheng and senior government officials, urging them to find ways to eliminate leprosy in China as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Reactionary Crimes and Robbery Crimes</h3>
<p>▲ The Cases of Each Defendant Will Be Tried Separately</p>
<p>Since the reactionary organization at 1132 Tongchun Lane, Gongping Road, was raided by the Hongkou police, and forged seals and forged letters of appointment were seized, and Lin Jinhan, a native of Tongzhou, was arrested, nine male and female accomplices have been arrested one after another. However, most of them are related to the robbery case. Except for Yu San, who escaped while being led by detectives to the Bao Yu Lane in the French Concession to recover stolen goods, there are still eight people remaining. They are being detained at the police station awaiting investigation and interrogation. This has been reported in this newspaper repeatedly. The day before yesterday, another local named Wu Asan was arrested by the Chinese and Western detectives handling the case. Yesterday morning, Lin Jinhan, Zhao Jiaying, Zhang Bingsheng, Zhang Wangshi, Nie Changfu, Bao Yongchang, Wu Rongsheng, Lin Qiaoyun, and other eight male and female defendants who were in custody were sent to the Second Tribunal of the Higher Branch Court. Judge Ye Zaizhou took the bench and ordered that the defendants, except Wu Rongsheng, Lin Qiaoyun, and Wu Asan, be brought forward for a further preliminary hearing. Because the parts of the charges against Lin Shuanghan and Zhao Jiaying that relate to internal disorder still need to be investigated, it was ordered that they be remanded to custody along with Zhang Bingsheng and Zhang Wangshi. Yan Changfu and Bao Yongchang were charged with robbery and it was ordered that they be transferred to the Special District Local Court for trial. After the order was given, the court recessed. Then, Judge Gao Junxiang took the bench and ordered Wu Rongsheng, Wu Asan, and the woman Lin Qiaoyun to be brought to the case for preliminary trial. They did not belong to the jurisdiction of the Higher Branch Court, and it was ordered that they be transferred to the Special District Local Court for trial. After the order was given, he also left the bench, and the defendants were still detained separately.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Fishing Boats Arrived in Wusong Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ More Than Five Hundred Pirates on the High Seas</p>
<p>▲ Fishing Boats Severely Harassed</p>
<p>The northern yellow croaker fishing boats from Wusong, after the Chen Shunxing boat from Cuisheng Fish Company arrived the day before yesterday (the 18th), all the fish companies thought that the other boats would arrive in Wusong continuously, and they all eagerly awaited them. It was not until the night before last that ten fishing boats, Wang Zengxing, Wang Heshun, Xu Liantai, Xu Fulong, Xu Wantai, Zhang Jixing, Jin Xulong, Xu Hefeng, Zuo Zengmao, and Chu Changlong, sold by Baofeng Fish Company, arrived in Wusong. Yesterday morning, more than ten boats, including Xu Hetai and Peng Jinfa, arrived. In one day, a total of twenty-five or six fishing boats arrived. Baofeng opened the market at nine catties per share. However, because the southern yellow croaker market has been crowded in recent days and the market has been sluggish, each customer demanded to increase it to nine and a half catties. Therefore, the hatch could not be opened in the morning. The customers from both upstream and downstream argued fiercely. It was not until the afternoon that they agreed on nine and a half catties, and each customer began to unload their boats and sell their goods. However, according to people in the fishing boats, more than five hundred pirates were discovered on the fishing waters this year. They demanded fees from each fishing boat, eighty yuan per boat. Those who had cash on board were allowed to fish after paying the fee. If they did not have cash, they would have their fish or cargo robbed after they caught the fish, or they would share it with the pirates. Therefore, none of the arriving boats were full of fish. Each boat owner complained incessantly about the difficulties of doing business. Two boats, Quan Tongchang and others, each caught two holds of spring fish, and all of their cargo was looted. Businessmen generally hope that the authorities will take measures to stop this, so as to help the merchants who are struggling to maintain the fishing industry.</p>
<h3>Farmers Tormented by Foul Odor</h3>
<p>▲ Collapsed on the Grave Mountain All Night</p>
<p>▲ Discovered Yesterday Morning by Passersby</p>
<p>Su Yixiang, a farmer from Sujiazhai, northwest of Wusong, 34 years old, left his home at about 3 p.m. the day before yesterday to collect club funds from his relative, Zhang's, home. Su's family waited until about 12 o'clock the night before last, but Su still had not returned home. Su's house was three miles away from Zhang's house. Fearing that Su might have encountered thieves on the way, they immediately sent many people to Zhang's house to inquire. According to Zhang's, Su arrived at Zhang's house, but at about 8 p.m., the club funds were not yet complete, so Su said that he would go to collect the money again the next morning, and then walked home. Su's family heard this and were very surprised, so they split up and went to visit relatives and friends everywhere to find him. However, there was no trace of him. It was not until about 6 a.m. yesterday morning that a farmer, Chen Xiaodi, went to the town market and saw Su collapsed on the side of the road on the grave mountain. Because he was familiar with him, he stepped forward to look at him and found that Su was groaning non-stop, as if he was sick. He immediately went to Su's house to report. Su's family went and carried Su back, and gave him ginger soup and other things to drink. It was not until about 9 a.m. that Su's mind gradually became clear. The family asked him why he was lying on the grave. Su said that after leaving Zhang's house the night before, it was already dark. He was walking on the road when he suddenly smelled an indescribable foul odor in his nose, and his mind suddenly became blurred. He did not know how he collapsed in the graves. Now, Su's spirit has returned to normal, and there are no signs of illness. Since this incident occurred, the farmers in the vicinity of the area believe that there must be a poisonous substance at work. Yesterday afternoon, they invited many people to go to the area near where Su collapsed to search, but no poisonous substance was found.</p>
<h3>Inquiries About Water Connection in the Fahua District</h3>
<p>The residents of Yangcun, Fahua District, West Shanghai, have always obtained their drinking water from the Shangao Pond. Last year, citizens Shi Zongtang and He Lanqing, etc., complained that the pond water was dirty and unsuitable for drinking. They planned to unite the villagers and raise funds to purchase water pipes and faucets to connect to the Hongqiao Road water pipes and temporarily purchase water from the Shanghai Waterworks Company. The municipal committee of the Fahua District reported the information to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau for review. After consideration, the bureau believed that it would harm sovereignty for citizens to directly use the foreign concession's tap water. In order to avoid future disputes, it did not approve the request. The bureau has now established limited measures for Chinese residents requesting access to the foreign concession's water and electricity, stipulating that temporary access will be permitted, but a written statement must be provided, stating that when the Chinese water and electricity lines arrive in the future, they will immediately switch to the Chinese water and electricity. The written statement has been sent to the committee member. If citizen Shi Zongtang and others still need to connect to tap water, the committee member can instruct them to fill out the written statement for verification.</p>
<h3>Change of Detention Order for Zhang Wenzheng in the Bigamy Case Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhang Wenzheng (also known as Zhang Yunqing), a compradore of the insurance department of the Arnhold, Karberg &amp; Co. from Nanxiang, was criminally charged with bigamy and abandonment by his wife Zhang Luoqingfen. The Special District Local Court had previously opened a hearing, but the defendant did not appear. It was ordered that the plaintiff lead the bailiffs to point out the defendant for another interrogation. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi opened a hearing, but the defendant still did not appear. The co-defendants Luo Cuiyun and Li Qitang also did not appear despite being summoned. According to the report from the Chinese bailiffs who went to serve the summons, they went to 1112 Xinping Lane, Longmen Road, the day before yesterday to summon Li Qitang, but his family claimed that Zhang Wenzheng did not live there, so Zhang could not be reached. Then, Li Qitang's son, Li Changyi, stated that although Zhang Wenzheng was his uncle-in-law, he really did not know his address. However, his aunt lived in Nanxiang, and his father could not appear in court today due to illness. After hearing Li's son's statement, the plaintiff, Luo Qingfen, claimed that Zhang Wenzheng was definitely living with Li. The lawyer for the plaintiff also claimed that Zhang and Li were both compradores at Arnhold, Karberg &amp; Co. and definitely lived together, which clearly showed that they were intentionally avoiding the summons. She requested detention. The court granted the request, and the case was adjourned again.</p>
<h3>Barber Castrated Himself in Anger</h3>
<p>▲ A Quarrel with His Mistress Led Him to This Act</p>
<p>Bian Jinkui, from Yangzhou, 45 years old, worked as a barber. His wife had passed away, and he lived with his mistress, Gao, at 3 Zixiang Lane, Denver Road. Gao, 36 years old, was also from Yangzhou. Yesterday, she had a quarrel with Bian Jinkui, and neither would give in. Bian, in a moment of anger, used a razor to cut off his own genitals while drunk. He collapsed in extreme pain. Gao immediately reported to the First Branch of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau and sent Bian to the hospital for treatment. Fortunately, his testicles were not affected, and his life was not in danger.</p>
<h3>Husband and Wife Sued Each Other</h3>
<p>▲ Wife Sued Husband for Abuse and Requested Divorce</p>
<p>▲ Husband Sued Wife for Adultery and Absconding</p>
<p>The woman, Wei Suqin, hired lawyer E. Sen to file a civil lawsuit in the Special District Local Court against her husband, Cheng Youren, for abuse and abandonment, requesting a divorce. After receiving the complaint, the court ordered the bailiffs to serve the summons. The defendant, Cheng Youren, appeared in court on time and hired lawyer Wu Chengyu. In addition to submitting a written defense and counterclaim, he also filed a criminal complaint against his wife, Wei Suqin, for committing adultery and absconding. It is now learned that the criminal case filed by Cheng has been summoned by the court to the defendant, Wei Suqin, to appear in court on the 23rd of this month to await trial. The divorce case filed by Wei was opened by Judge Yang Yi of the Civil Court yesterday morning. After briefly questioning the lawyers of both parties about the case, because Cheng had filed a separate criminal lawsuit against his wife, the divorce case should be postponed pending the outcome of the criminal case. The lawyers and parties on both sides heard the order and left.</p>
<h3>Mistress Kills Paramour</h3>
<p>▲ The Murderer Fled ▲ Implicated the Husband</p>
<p>Yuan, the wife of Cao Erlang, a native of Chongming, who lived in the Lu Xuejia House in the Chinese area of West Shanghai, Whitelee Road, was naturally promiscuous. She first had an affair with Xue Arong, who lived in the same house. At first, their relationship was quite harmonious, but later, she had an affair with Tang Agen, and they were very intimate, going out and traveling together without any scruples. Xue saw them several times and was consumed by anger, which led to the tragedy due to jealousy. The day before yesterday, Xue Arong carried a sharp axe, found Zhao, and chopped him with the axe. Zhao was chopped several times on the head and body, and blood flowed into a ditch. Zhao collapsed in a pool of blood. Xue saw that his goal had been achieved and fled without a trace. Later, the police arrived and sent Zhao to the nearby Chinese Red Cross Hospital on Hager Road for treatment. Unfortunately, he was seriously injured and could not be saved. He died soon after. The local court has been notified to send someone to examine the body. The police have detained Cao Erlang and Yuan, the husband and wife, and sent them to the court for investigation, and they are tracking down the murderer Xue Arong to bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law Appeared in Court</h3>
<p>▲ Mother-in-Law Sued Daughter-in-Law for Assault</p>
<p>▲ Aftermath of the Dispute Over Five Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>The woman, Xu Chen, previously sued her mother-in-law, Yan Cao, in the Shanghai Local Court for not paying a deposit of five hundred yuan. Yan Cao submitted a defense, stating that the deposit belonged to her daughter, Xu Yan (i.e., Xu Chen's daughter-in-law), so she refused to pay it. A judgment was then issued, determining that Yan Cao had lost the case. Therefore, Xu Chen hired a lawyer and also filed a separate lawsuit with the court, stating that her husband, Xu Jialong, had died in 1915, leaving a son, named Xiliang, who was only three years old. She had a private savings of 1,900 yuan, which she deposited in her mother's home in 1922 to earn interest for living expenses. Last October, she returned to Ningbo for some reason, and her savings passbook was taken away by her aunt, Xu Chen. Now, after continuous withdrawals, there is still 500 yuan left in the deposit. She intends to use it to marry a daughter-in-law. She requested that it be awarded to her so that she could withdraw it. As a result, the deposit was allowed to be withdrawn by Xu Yan. At noon on February 27 of this year, after the court hearing, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, Xu Chen and Xu Yan, left the court. A conflict arose on the way. The next day, Xu Chen went to the prosecutor's office of the Local Court to criminally sue her daughter-in-law, Xu Yan, for assaulting her. After investigation, the criminal court was convened and requested a public trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Deng opened a hearing. The plaintiff, Xu Chen, hired lawyer Sha Xunyi to appear in court and make a statement, while the defendant, Xu Yan, also hired lawyer Ma Junshuo to defend her. The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law appeared in court. Xu Chen stated first that after leaving the court on February 27, her daughter-in-law, Xu Yan, twisted her arm with her hand. When they returned home to the Jiuxiaochang, Dong Kaiqi came to her house and committed assault. She asked for investigation. Xu Yan stated that the former civil litigation led to a situation where, after leaving the court, the mother-in-law grabbed her and demanded the 500 yuan deposit. She bit her own arm and falsely accused her of hitting her. She asked for a review. She was asked what Dong Kaiqi was to her and answered that he was a relative of her sister. Dong Kaiqi claimed to be in the porcelain business. He was passing by Jiuxiaochang that day and saw Xu Yan's son, Xiliang, crying at the door. He asked and learned that there was a dispute between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, Xu Chen and Xu Yan. He entered to mediate and did not commit any assault. Xu Xiliang claimed to be seventeen years old. Xu Chen was his grandmother and Xu Yan was his mother. He testified that his mother did not hit his grandmother. After the lawyers on both sides argued, it was ordered that the debate be concluded and that they wait for the verdict. They then left the court.</p>
<h3>A Child Arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing</h3>
<p>▲ Boarded a Ship in Nanjing to Play</p>
<p>▲ Unexpectedly Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>The day before yesterday evening, a boy of about ten years old was lost at the Swire &amp; Co. pier in Pudong and was wandering around crying. Jiang Jiming, the resident officer, saw him and took him in. He was sent to the Third District yesterday. According to the boy, his name was Hu Shibao, he was eleven years old, and he was from Anhui. His father had passed away, but his mother was still alive. A few days ago, he went to play on the Wuchang ferry at Xiaguan, Nanjing. Unexpectedly, the ship suddenly set sail and went all the way to Shanghai. The ship docked and he went ashore, but he had nowhere to go. The district chief decided to send him to the Public Security Bureau to wait for someone to claim him.</p>

<h3>Ji Sheng Hui's Zhang Xianqing to Depart for Shaanxi Today to Handle Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Qing, director of the China Ji Sheng Hui's Shaanxi relief efforts, previously returned to Shanghai from Xi'an to raise funds and personally reported on the severity of the disaster to Lu, stating that it was a critical period between harvests when people could not survive without rice. He personally witnessed the tragic situation, which was reported in newspapers. He originally intended to return to Shaanxi Province immediately to plan relief efforts, but was delayed due to road obstacles and various other reasons. Now, Director Zhang believes that the Shaanxi disaster must be addressed, or else the opportunity will be lost, with unimaginable consequences. He has vowed to go, even though raising relief funds is not easy. However, the association will do its best as a matter of benevolence. He will endure long journeys, undeterred by thorns and braving dangers. He is scheduled to depart on the 22nd day of the fourth month of the national calendar, accompanied by several relief workers, aboard the Taikoo's Shuntian轮船, taking a detour via Beiping to Shaanxi. He will handle spring relief efforts and discuss the implementation of resettlement programs for disaster victims in Henan and Shaanxi. Director Zhang and the relief workers, at a time when a major disaster awaits relief and the local area is unsettled, are traveling thousands of miles to carry out relief work in Shaanxi. Their enthusiasm and determination are commendable. Hopefully, the disaster victims in Shaanxi and Henan can have their suffering slightly reduced.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Businesses Retain Director Ni</h3>
<p>Ni Zhecheng, director of the first district of the fourth precinct of the Municipal Police Bureau, received instructions from Director Yuan on the 20th of this month to transfer to the Inspection Department. Upon hearing the news, businesses in Zhabei gathered at the former site of the Zhabei Eleventh Road Business Association at 10:00 AM yesterday to discuss and petition for his retention and reinstatement. Over a hundred businesses from areas like Mongolia Road, Xinjiang Road, Guangfu Road, Manchuria Road, Datong Road, Huasheng Road, Jucheng, Renhe, Tongsheng, and Yifeng attended. Mr. She Guanting, owner of Yifeng Lumber Mill, chaired the meeting. All agreed that Director Ni had served in Zhabei for over a decade, providing meticulous service in maintaining local order and protecting commerce. He has consistently performed well and has been recognized by his superiors and the current Director Yuan as a rare and virtuous police officer. A unanimous decision was made to retain him. A document was drafted, led by Mr. Wang Binyan, a local notable from Zhabei, with all the businesses affixing their seals. The document was submitted to Mayor Zhang of the Municipal Government and Director Yuan of the Public Security Bureau, requesting that they heed the public's plea, revoke the transfer order, and immediately reinstate him as director to satisfy public expectations.</p>
<h3>Russian Automobile Accident</h3>
<p>▲ Driving Across Boundaries and Hitting a Girl</p>
<p>Zhou, a resident of No. 65 Xiaoyou Lane, Xujiahui, Shanghai, has a daughter named Xingzhen, who is ten years old. Yesterday at 2:10 PM, while returning home after shopping on the street, she was passing in front of Xu Ge Cheng's hat shop on Haig Road at the boundary, when suddenly a French Concession police officer No. 140, Russian Bao Baofu (transliteration), along with his brother and girlfriend, drove his own car (license number 7883) from north to south, entering the Chinese territory road and hitting Zou Xingzhen, knocking her to the ground. The Russian, realizing he had caused an accident, immediately tried to escape. Fortunately, Xie Yongzhang, a police officer from the third post in the area, noticed and pursued him, stopping the car. Unexpectedly, the Russian woman was extremely fierce and tried to assault Officer Xie. As the crowd grew, they voiced their disapproval. Luckily, the Public Security Bureau was nearby. Director Xu, hearing the commotion, realized there was an incident and immediately sent Inspector Xu Tao and Patrol Leader Wang Zhentang with police officers to disperse the crowd and prevent violence. He also advised the Russian to drive the car to the station to prevent further incidents. However, the Russian woman, unable to communicate, arbitrarily cursed and shouted for assistance from the French soldiers stationed there. Fortunately, the French soldiers knew the incident occurred in Chinese territory and ignored her. Patrol Leader Wang, seeing the situation was not good and fearing they would escape to the Concession, pushed the car, along with the three Russians, to the station for detention. He also sent the injured girl to the Aurora Hospital on Rue Père Robert for treatment. It is reported that she suffered serious head, face, and waist injuries, and her life may be in danger. The driver who caused the accident (i.e., police officer Bao Baofu) and the other two Russians were temporarily handed over to French Concession detectives Ge Lai'er for questioning. All losses and violations will be the responsibility of the French Concession.</p>
<h3>Lu Chunshan Falls into Water and Cannot be Found</h3>
<p>Lu Chunshan's flower-clothed boat, carrying 200 bales of Longhe's flower clothing, was anchored in Rihui Port yesterday. Due to the rapid rising tide and the heavy load, over sixty bales of flower clothing on the boat's surface were swept away by waves. Lu cried for help upon seeing this and accidentally fell into the water. His fellow crew members were unable to rescue him. The Life Saving Bureau has been notified and has dispatched a patrol boat to search for him.</p>
<h3>Fire Incident Report</h3>
<p>▲Shiqing Road: Gu Tiansheng Cotton Warehouse, No. 8 Shiqing Road, within the jurisdiction of the First Office of the Fifth District of the Zhabei Public Security Bureau, caught fire unintentionally around 3:00 AM yesterday. Five warehouses and many bales of old flower clothing were burned down. Fire brigades from various sections of Zhabei rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire. Zhu Ada, a Shanghainese man who was watching over the warehouse, was detained by the police for questioning.</p>
<p>▲Mongolia Road: At 1:25 PM yesterday, a careless accident occurred in the kitchen of Xinglong Tea Garden, No. 119 Mongolia Road, Zhabei. The fire brigade arrived at the scene and extinguished the fire. The loss was minor.</p>
<h3>Deaf-Mute Girl Lost</h3>
<p>Yesterday around 12:00 PM, Tian Wenzhuo, a sentinel from the 26th post of the First Precinct of the First District of the Nanshi Police, found a girl, about ten years old, crying on the road near Qiuxin Bridge. When asked about her origin, the child only gestured with her hands and feet and spoke unintelligibly. It was then realized that she was a deaf-mute. Judging from her appearance, it seemed that she had lost her way. She was immediately taken to the station. After questioning by the director, her identity remained unknown. An official document was prepared and sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau requesting for her to be taken care of. The girl's clothing is as follows: wearing a blue floral qipao, white socks and blue cloth shoes, and her hair has been cut short.</p>
<h3>Meeting Record of the Women's Suffrage Association</h3>
<p>The Chinese Women's Suffrage Association held its second spring meeting yesterday at No. 23 Yuanmingyuan Road. More than ten people attended, including Xu Huang Danzhi and Mao Wang Ruizhu. Ms. Liu Wang Liming chaired the meeting, and each department reported on recent work. The following resolutions were discussed and decided: (1) The Shanghai International Women's Federation is an organization established by women's groups from various countries, and the Suffrage Association is one of its fundamental members. Seeing that the International Women's Federation will hold a speech and discussion meeting at the American Women's Association on the 29th, Zheng Yuxiu, Lin Huizhen, Liu Jichen, Fang Huiqiu, Liu Wang Liming, Zheng Huichen, Mao Wang Ruizhu, and Xu Jiang Shaoying were appointed to represent the association.

<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory issued the following weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday: The sky will be mostly cloudy along the coast of the country and in the Yangtze River basin. There will be northeast to southeast winds over the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea. Winds in the Yangtze River basin will be directionless. The weather in the Xisha Islands is poor. The reason is that Xu is moving westward. Also, before 3:00 PM yesterday, within the hour, the highest temperature in the city was 69.1 degrees and the lowest was 52.4 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest temperature was 65.2 degrees and the lowest was 41.4 degrees.</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor</p>

At that time, the order of the event was jointly maintained by our corps members and patrol officers from our precinct, and no conflict occurred. What your newspaper published is likely based on inaccurate rumors. We are specifically requesting a correction to clarify the truth. Respectfully, Baoshan County First District Security Corps, Baoshan County Public Security Bureau Directly Subordinate First Police Precinct, April 19th.</p>

<p>▲A: Why did Napoleon say that a pen is mightier than ten thousand Mausers? What power does the pen have after all?</p>

<h3>A Record of Hearing Qin Music at Sea</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Living in a remote area of Songjiang, I feel a sense of emptiness. It is difficult to find one or two kindred spirits to converse with about the past and present to alleviate my poverty. Suddenly, Qian Zihua sent me a letter inviting me to a feast at Jue Lin's place, saying that he had invited several qin music friends, painting companions, and Buddhists for an evening of enjoyment. I was delighted to hear this and went. Zihua had a grand plan to travel south and visit the tomb of Sakyamuni. He described the details in great detail. Later, Mr. Zhang Yuguang, Wang Taomin, Yuan Xilian, Zhao Lanting and others arrived gracefully. We all took our seats. The few vegetarian dishes were delicious. Xilian is a legal scholar, but recently he has been devoted to Zen Buddhism. His conversation was mostly about Buddhist terms, saying that we all have our own karma for entering and leaving the world. The only thing to do is to always keep the Bodhi mind in mind, which is a good thing. This is indeed a famous saying. Zihua took out a fan-shaped booklet with Xun Huisheng's landscape painting and Mei Lanfang's flower paintings. The landscape painting was full of ink charm, and the flower painting was a painting of the Ten Sisters, with beautiful colors, which was especially exquisite. Tao is a famous painter. He talked about the coloring of ancient people. There are light and heavy colors. The lighter ones are delicate, and the heavier ones are calm. Often, the front is colored, and then the back is dyed to set it off. Some are colored and then brushed off, and then reset repeatedly to see its thickness. Modern people do not have this skill. Tao Min also played the qin. According to him, the qin must be more than a hundred years old to be played. Its sound is dull and dull, not as bright as the old one. The paint is easy to crack. The plum blossom crack is the most common, followed by the snake belly crack, and then the ox hair crack. It is a pity that this tune has not been played for a long time. There is a sense of dust on the Zhu string. It should be taken care of slowly. Although he is not willing to live in Boya, he should also ask the scholars to be Zhong Ziqi. Lanting listened to it and suddenly jumped up and said. I have a qin friend, Lin Suyuan, who is from Fujian. He likes to travel. He always carries Jiao Tong with him when he travels north and south. He has come to Shanghai and lives in the Grand China Hotel. The dance floor is next door, and the barbarian music is noisy. However, he closed the door quietly, playing the qin to relieve his boredom, forgetting that he was in the midst of a soft red world. He is a true noble man. Why don't we visit him? After eating, Yuguang and Taomin still had other appointments, so they left in a hurry. We then went to Tibet Road together. Xilian said. There is a saying that playing the qin to a cow. We do not understand the rhythm, is it a cow? We all laughed. When we arrived, Lin Junsuyuan, who was thin and had a beautiful beard, was there. There was a qin on the table, and he was dusting it. After the introduction, I looked at the qin. It was full of ancient charm. It was an old object from the Zhu Ming Dynasty. It was engraved with the inscription. It was made in ancient times and repaired in modern times. It also shows the heart of heaven and earth. I asked him to play it. Jun was humble again and again. He began to play the second part of Gui Qulai. The sound was as fine as the weeping of insects, as far as the winding of water, as rapid as the sudden arrival of summer rain and the sudden wind. Listening intently, all thoughts were eliminated. Therefore, the saying that those who play the qin are forbidden in the past is not false. The sound of the qin stopped, but the remaining sound still lingered between the fingers, making people feel far away. It was already midnight. So I said goodbye and returned. I wrote it down as Hong Zhao.</p>
<h3>The Strange Story of a Cat Ringing the Doorbell</h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>A few dozen steps from my house is the residence of my classmate Mr. Liu. Mr. Liu has a passion for cats. He keeps more than thirty cats, which consume countless fish. Among them are two tortoiseshell cats, given by his sister. They are the most gentle and pleasing. Mr. and Mrs. Liu love them like the apples of their eyes. Not only do they share their meals and sleep with them, but they also strictly forbid servants from harming a single hair on them. Once, a servant accidentally touched a cat's ear and was scolded by Mr. Liu. This was a laughing matter for a while.</p>
<p>In the twelfth month of last year, one of these tortoiseshell cats, named "Jin Si", suddenly disappeared without a trace. Mr. Liu searched for her everywhere, but to no avail. He was very frustrated. The second tortoiseshell cat, named "Yin Si," lost its partner due to its sister's disappearance, and cried all day long, refusing to eat. Mr. Liu felt even more uneasy when he saw this.</p>
<p>Someone told him a secret method for finding cats, boasting that it was extremely effective. Mr. Liu knew that this was a superstitious act, but out of love for his cat, he tried it anyway. The method involved placing a bowl of water on the stove, filling it with clear water, and placing a weighing pole with a weighing hammer and hook on the mouth of the bowl. There was nothing else different. Mr. Liu did as he was told. After more than a month, there was still no trace of the cat, so he gradually forgot about it.</p>
<p>The other day, late at night, Mr. and Mrs. Liu were sleeping soundly under their quilts when they suddenly heard the doorbell ringing loudly, deafeningly. Mr. Liu was awakened by this and thought that at this late hour, who would be an unwelcome guest? Probably a gang of thieves. He couldn't help but feel a chill down his spine. While he was hesitating, the doorbell rang again, even louder, mixed with the sound of a cat meowing. The sound was very familiar. Mr. Liu got out of bed, put on his clothes, and went to the door to see what was going on. As soon as he opened the door, the bell rang again, but there was no one there. The cold wind was blowing, threatening to extinguish the fire. Mr. Liu saw that there was no one outside the door and almost cried out in alarm.</p>
<p>At this time, the cat's mournful cry was heard intermittently, close at hand. Mr. Liu looked around and caught sight of his lost cat "Jin Si," crouching high on the doorstep, ringing the doorbell with its paw, looking quite comical. Mr. Liu was overjoyed. He held the cat in his arms, closed the door, and returned to his room. He told his wife, "Jin Si is back! Jin Si is back!" His wife was also overjoyed and gave Jin Si a sweet kiss.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I ran into Mr. Liu on the road. Mr. Liu happily told me about the cat's recovery. I smiled and said, "Jin Si didn't climb into the house through the roof, but came up with the idea of ringing the doorbell. You don't blame her for disturbing your dreams, but instead find it funny and love her even more. Is she a reincarnation of a raccoon dog?" Mr. Liu nodded and laughed loudly.</p>
<p>Jin Si returned safely, and I also benefited greatly. My house keeps dozens of pigeons, which are coveted by wild cats. Jin Si and her sister Yin Si often come to guard them. Last year, they fought a deadly battle with two wild cats in my garden. Although they suffered minor neck injuries, they finally drove the two cats away, and my pigeons were spared.</p>
<h3>A Record of a Large Lantern in the Sky</h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>For national day celebrations and revolutionary anniversaries, celebrations are held everywhere, and lantern parades are always held. Lantern parades are usually held at night. The lights are bright and the country is happy. We see them everywhere. However, I have never heard of a lantern parade being held in the sky. I will now record the story of my friend Mr. Zhao Qichang's lantern in the sky to prove my point.</p>
<p>The spring is bright and beautiful, and all things are competing for beauty. In this beautiful sunny weather, children like to play and compete to fly kites. Gongshuzi made Sen Yuan. Rhyme stories are spread. This kind of toy has been popular for thousands of years. My friend Zhao Qichang also loves it. Every year in February and March, he racked his brains to make various shapes of insects, fish, birds and animals and put them in the sky. A few days ago, he had a whimsical idea. He used cellophane to paste dozens of lanterns. Each one was connected by a line. Another dry flashlight was embedded inside. At night, the flashlight was turned on. Dozens of lanterns were carried to the suburbs and released. A gust of wind. They all rose into the wind. At this time, each lantern was a foot away from each other. Outside the cellophane, the electric light was bright. It swayed in the sky and suddenly formed a long snake formation. At first glance, it was walking heel to toe. It was no different from the lantern parade on the ground. The order was well maintained and perhaps even exceeded it. This is truly a new way to play in the kite craze with a whimsical idea. Those who have a kite addiction, why not imitate it?</p>
<h3>A Record of a Westerner's Estate Analysis</h3>
<p>— Jie Lu</p>
<p>The owner of a certain foreign firm at sea is an Englishman. More than fifty years ago, he came to Shanghai alone and operated real estate with a small amount of capital. After decades of hard work, he accumulated three to four million yuan. Although he is not as rich as Hardoon, his keen vision and successful operation can be compared with Hardoon. After the Opium War, Chinese and foreign trade was carried out. The foreign concession was only ten miles long. There was no such prosperity as today. The owner was good at planning and multiplying wealth. He bought cheap, barren land. After managing it, it is now a prosperous area on the sea. The value per mu is hundreds of thousands of gold. It is appropriate for a fat-faced man to be a wealthy man. However, the owner has a strange hobby. He owns extremely large real estate at sea, but he rents a few rooms to live in. He does not travel by car. Sometimes he walks as a car. He is happy. Alas, people at sea drive motorcycles and fly around, as if everyone is rich. In fact, as the ancients said, "The car is dazzling and the people are exhausted." They are everywhere. Compared with the owner, how can they not be ashamed to death? However, the owner is so frugal, could it be that he has become a money-grubber? But it is not. The owner knows that he is old, so he made a will. Half of his fortune will be used to help the education business. The Chinese who have served in his foreign firm for a long time will also receive tens of thousands of gold. It can be said to be generous. Alas, the poison of inheritance is the deepest among Chinese people. Today, there are many brothers and sisters who file lawsuits over inheritance disputes. Isn't it the evil of the inheritance system? How can we take a certain Westerner as a model? Alas, it can be customized.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes in Southeast Asia (15)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>I arrived in Singapore on the morning of the 20th. But it is not easy to get to Singapore. There are two conditions. One is to check the passport. The second is to check the epidemic. This is the iron law at all docks. It is not easy to get to Singapore. The English are more liberal in checking passports than the French. The British colony has been able to succeed at sea because it has a reputation for generosity and freedom. The English just check and stamp it. The French spend a lot of time writing a lot of documents, which is just a description of their narrowness and harshness. In addition, the doctor who checks the disease has great power. There is only one small boat that comes to check the epidemic. A yellow flag is hung on the epidemic checking boat. If this flag does not fall, merchant ships are not allowed to enter the port. You must watch this flag fall before passenger ships are allowed to enter the port freely. I can't help but admit that Westerners often use hygiene as an excuse. It seems that they value life very much. Why can they mobilize 20 million people in Europe to kill each other within ten days? How cheap is their life? It is really upside down. What we should know here is that the French postal ship is very clean. We only saw the epidemic checking boat come, but we did not see it checking the guests for the epidemic. If the British ship is in the fourth class or below, it is said that they must take off their clothes and check their bodies. Those who have the epidemic cannot land. There is another small island. They are placed there. Their clothes are fumigated with sulfur. They must collect firewood and cook rice themselves. After going through 1727, they can enter the port after they recover from the disease. I often tell people that there are many difficult things in the world to understand, such as the Thorough Principle written by Lu Xinjun. Today, Europe and the United States are politics of the rich, so poverty is a crime. The bodies of the poor are the homes of epidemic insects. In fact, the bodies of the poor are healthier than those of the rich. For example, tuberculosis is more common among the rich. If we are involved in Russia, it is the opposite. They are politics of the poor. The rich are a crime. The sun is near and Chang'an is far away. How can we determine what is right and wrong? However, if we use the Chinese culture of neutrality to measure it fairly, it is not fair. Sin is sin and should not be judged based on wealth. Alas, I am indignant about this, so I am determined to use the new Eastern culture to save the world. Can people of far-sightedness in the world help me?</p>
<p>When I arrived at the dock, there was a hotel in Southeast Asia to pick up guests. They called a car and took my luggage directly to the hotel. They are very skilled at picking up guests. They speak all kinds of dialects. There were Indians at the dock asking for money. They did not give them a penny. They were not checked either. They drove straight to the hotel. The total cost was three yuan and two corners. If you negotiate with the people at the dock yourself, it will cost a lot of money.</p>
<p>I stayed in a room for three yuan a day. The food was not included. It was spacious and clean. Three yuan here is equal to five yuan in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I visited Chen Lizhi of the Buddhist Association. Wang Zhi'an told me that Wang had died a month ago. He was an important figure in Buddhism. I had received a letter from him. It was very sincere. Now he is dead. Chen took me to visit the Abbot of Tianfu Palace, Zhuan Dao, and stayed at the temple.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 21st, Dao Master asked Chen to take me to the Longshan Temple Garden Building. Chen paid for the accommodation. The people of the Buddhist Association here complained that I did not call earlier so that they could prepare to welcome me.</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart (176)</h3>

<p>Chapter 10: Red Flames Rise to the Sky, the Brothel Reveres Filial Piety; At the Banquet, Meeting the Famous Courtesan Hong Nu Shutie</p>
<p>After this fire, Wen Guizhi had no place to live. She had to stay in a hotel nearby. At that time, one person told ten people, and ten people told a hundred people. People in the brothel, especially, liked to talk about right and wrong. Everyone said that Wen Guizhi was really a filial grandson. If it weren't for her, this old lady would have gone with the Fire God Bodhisattva. That Lord Yan knew about this and came to see her the next day. It just so happened that this day, a friend invited him to drink wine with courtesans. He called Wen Guizhi to the stage. Everyone surrounded her and asked about the fire yesterday. Many courtesans in the brothel used Wen Guizhi's desperate attempt to save her grandmother from the fire as a topic of conversation. That Lord Yan was also a literary figure. Many of his friends were not only dignitaries, but also literati. Some people even wrote poems to praise Wen Guizhi. Once praised, her reputation increased tenfold. Many friends urged Lord Yan, saying that you have such a good person, not only is her appearance good, but her temperament and morality are also so top-notch. Why haven't you hidden her in a golden house? Isn't this a missed opportunity? Lord Yan originally liked Wen Guizhi very much. Every time he called for her to sing, he would call for her. Sometimes when he was happy, he would call for her three or four times a day. If she was a little late, he would stretch his neck and look for her. Now, he couldn't stand the praise from everyone. And she, in fact, had such an anecdote that was enough to make people amazed and praised. There was no happier thing in the world than to have one's lover praised by others. So today, Lord Yan's face was radiant. He opened his mouth wide and just laughed, like a wooden fish that had been knocked open. But he asked Wen Guizhi, "Then have all your things been burned? Your loss this time is not small." Wen Guizhi also honestly said, "I don't have many jewelry to begin with. Fortunately, I wore them all on my body when I went to your brothel yesterday. Lord Yan, you also know my temper. I don't like to wear them when I rent them at a high price. But the clothes, regardless of leather, cotton, or single, have all been burned, because those clothes boxes were all piled up in my grandmother's room." Lord Yan immediately wanted to comfort her, "Clothes are limited after all. Don't take it to heart. I will compensate you for how many clothes were burned." Everyone present clapped their hands in agreement, saying, "That's right, that's right. Lord Yan should compensate immediately. Burn the old ones and let Lord Yan make new ones. It's not just compensation, but it should also be a reward." Another friend joked, "This is all because you two are too enthusiastic. Because you're too hot, you caused this fire."</p>

<h3>Bond Market: More Gains Than Losses</h3>
<p>▲ Trading Volume Exceeds 570,000</p>
<p>Yesterday's bond market saw a relatively active futures market in the morning session, with a trading volume of over 3.8 million yuan between the two sessions. The afternoon market was quiet, with a trading volume of less than 2 million yuan. The total trading volume reached over 5.7 million yuan, with customs bonds accounting for the largest share at about 2 million yuan, followed by rehabilitation bonds at over 800,000 yuan, demobilization bonds at nearly 800,000 yuan, and continued "Entire 6" bonds at around 700,000 yuan. Other bonds saw very little activity, especially the seven-year financial bonds. Spot trading was also scarce, with a total trading volume of only 10,000 yuan for the entire day. As for price movements, the market was calm, and supply and demand were balanced, so prices remained stable. As a result, compared to the previous weekend, demobilization bonds experienced mixed gains and losses, while disarmament and financial "96" bonds remained unchanged. Other bonds saw buyers take a more advantageous position, with prices rebounding by 0.2-0.3 yuan to 0.6-0.7 yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Stalemated Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market was sluggish and uninteresting. Both bulls and bears were manufacturers with strong capabilities and fierce competition. Overall, the unstable situation, stagnant spot sales, and relatively thick inventories made the general trend soften. Outsiders were hesitant to take action given this situation, resulting in small fluctuations. New deliveries were scarce, and long-term trading was minimal, with many short selling orders. However, the situation for this month was still serious. Rumors spread that sellers had taken delivery of about 2,000-3,000 bales of 20-count Five Blessings and Shepherd yarns. This news weakened market sentiment and caused a decline.</p>
<p>▲ Mixed Trends in Yarn Futures In the morning session, the bull side held firm, and rumors of labor unrest led some retail investors to buy in. Near-term contracts rose by 0.6-0.7 yuan. News that the labor unrest was untrue caused a sudden drop in the market. At the same time, the Osaka Sampin Exchange (Sanshin) telegraph also reported a small decline, loosening the market. As a result, the current month contract fell by 0.03 yuan, while long-term contracts rose by 0.013 yuan. In the afternoon, sellers prepared to deliver, further weakening the market. The current month contract fell by 0.05 yuan, and long-term contracts fell by 0.01-0.03 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 10,800 bales. The closing prices for Renbiao (cotton yarn exchange) are recorded below:</p>
<p>| Contract | Closing Price | Change | Inventory | Contract | Closing Price | Change | Inventory |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| April | 1522 | Down 8 | 33,500 | July | 1524 | Down 2 | 25,950 |</p>
<p>| May | 1518 | Down 1 | 40,800 | August | 1527 | Down 2 | 20,350 |</p>
<p>| June | 1524 | Up 2 | 32,450 | September | 1532 | Down 3 | 8,500 |</p>
<p>▲ Good Sales of Spot Yarn  Various trading groups bought a total of 1,500 bales, with fellow traders taking 400 bales. Prices were stable. Traders from Sichuan bought the most, accounting for 540 bales, followed by Anqing traders with 260 bales, Jinan with 85 bales, Shantou with 100 bales, inland traders with 270 bales, Wuhu with 40 bales, Fujian with 60 bales, Ningbo with 30 bales, Jiangxi with 50 bales, and miscellaneous traders with 60 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Quiet and Stagnant</h3>
<p>The cotton market was slightly flat, but the trend remained firm. Due to the shortage of inventories in local warehouses and the reluctance of new sellers to take action, the local cotton market was unlikely to decline unless there was a significant drop in foreign cotton prices. Furthermore, the Han traders were bullish and refused to let go, while the East cotton traders intended to squeeze shorts in this month. Given these factors, it was impossible to be overly pessimistic.</p>
<p>▲ Near-Term Strength, Long-Term Weakness in Cotton Futures In the morning session, the Hanbiao (cotton exchange) market opened with a firm tone, rebounding by 0.05 yuan. Subsequently, at the second and third trading plates, some traders took profits, causing a slight dip. As a result, it fell by 0.05-0.10 yuan. In the afternoon, the Osaka Sampin yarn market declined, and there was a potential for a decline in US cotton prices, leaving the market sentiment flat. As a result, there were no significant fluctuations in any of the contract months. The total trading volume for the day was 21,900 dan. The closing prices for Hanbiao are recorded below:</p>
<p>| Contract | Closing Price | Change | Inventory | Contract | Closing Price | Change | Inventory |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| June | 3545 | Down 5 | 72,500 |    |    |    |    |</p>
<p>| April | 3630 |  ... | 51,100 | July | 3535 | Down 10 | 68,500 |</p>
<p>| May | 3560 | Down 10 | 81,000 | August | 3535 | Down 10 | 56,800 |</p>
<p>▲ Quiet Spot Cotton Market All factories maintained a wait-and-see attitude. As for the sources from the docks, Yao cotton arrivals totaled 1,100 bales, and Tong cotton totaled 1,500 bales. The sales record is below:</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 37.25, sold to Hongzhang Factory, 200 pieces, spot delivery to the factory.</p>
<p>Also, 37.75, also sold to Hongzhang Factory, 100 pieces, also, also.</p>

<h3>Grains: Rice Market Remains Sluggish</h3>
<p>▲ Zhabei Yesterday, over ten trading groups arrived, but sales were sluggish. Changshu and Xichang white japonica rice continued to weaken. Top-grade japonica rice remained around 20 yuan inside and outside the customs, with no rise or fall. High-grade japonica rice continued to decline, with medium and lower grades being reduced in price. The difference in price between grades was nearly a jiao. However, retailers seemed to be holding steady, with a difference of about half a jiao. Japonica rice is unlikely to improve in the near future. Thin indica rice saw both arrivals and sales stagnate, and prices remained weak. However, top-grade rice was still available at 19 yuan outside the customs. There was steady demand for Xiang indica rice, but arrivals remained scarce, so trading was still weak. Dujian rice was also similar. The overall market felt firm. Baiyuan rice was sluggish and poor, with prices similar to the previous day.</p>
<p>▲ South Shanghai  Arriving boats from Hexia continued to be scarce. There was little high-grade northern japonica rice, with medium and lower grades being the main offerings. Sales in the street remained mediocre, with prices clearly defined but secretly weakening. Although Suzhou-Tong machine-milled rice was slightly tight due to the limited supply, buyers were not eager to purchase, with only a few retail transactions taking place. The market price was around 18 yuan. Southern road, Jiaoli, and Sijing indica rice were all stagnant, and demand was very weak, making it difficult for the market to flourish. There were no strong arrivals of Xiang or Duzi Xiang indica rice, and the sales of southern road rice were also lackluster. Prices remained stable. Bianyuan rice was negatively impacted by sluggishness and low trading volume, trending downwards.</p>
<h3>Soybean Futures Weak, Spot Prices Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, near-term continuous soybeans were weak. Although the telegraph from Dalian was flat, the current month weakened due to buyers gradually selling to close positions. As for sellers, they were preparing to deliver due to weak spot sales. As a result, the standard price returned to 5 taels, 3 qian, and 7 fen, a decrease of 0.03-0.04 yuan. Spot soybean prices remained stable, with high-grade soybeans at around 0.04 yuan and medium-grade soybeans at 0.036-0.037 yuan. Sales were mainly for local small-scale mills. Traders from inland regions were observing due to low profitability. The soybean market was currently stagnant.</p>
<h3>High Rice Futures Prices, Stagnant Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market turned from rising to stable. After the sharp rise of 0.1 yuan and more in the afternoon of the previous day, various trading groups stopped buying, leading to extreme sluggishness yesterday morning. However, after a small price drop, the Wenzhou trading group, local traders, and low-priced outlets began to open the market, with a total of over 20,000. This allowed the market to stabilize. No. 1 Saigon was offered at 15.9 yuan, No. 2 at 15 yuan, small broken rice at 15.2 yuan, and big broken Min Dang rice at 15.1 yuan, a slight decrease of 0.1 yuan compared to the highest price of the previous day. Overseas rice futures prices were reported to be rising, and foreign firms were adhering to their positions. The prices for returned goods were very high, but due to concerns about market disruption, most were observing and not selling. Therefore, overall market transactions were very limited.</p>
<h3>Sunny Weather Causes Flour Market to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the prices for all months of flour fell across the board. Due to the gradually improving weather in recent days, people had expected higher prices. However, traders from inland regions reported that wheat seedlings were growing very well, as the climate was suitable for wheat development. If this situation did not change drastically, a good harvest could be expected in the future, causing market sentiment to soften. Subsequently, traders from Tianjin sold some near-term and long-term contracts, believing that the prices were too high given the arrival of new flour. Therefore, they sold as market sentiment weakened. This was the observation of spot sales groups. It is unknown whether traders from inland regions were moved by this. As a result, the price for this month fell by 0.005 yuan compared to the previous week, May fell by 0.0125 yuan, June fell by 0.015 yuan, July fell by 0.0125 yuan, August fell by 0.01 yuan, and September fell by 0.005 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures: Near-Term Decline, Long-Term Stability</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures market for wheat showed a near-term decline and long-term stability. The current month saw declines due to bulls selling, while factories remained unmoved. In addition, as the delivery date approached, speculative long positions took the opportunity to close out. As for inventories, the arrival of new supplies was not as strong as expected due to the time of year when new crops were emerging. Speculators dared not hoard goods. This was the biggest reason for the decline. Due to the excellent weather, wheat seedlings were reported to be growing well, causing market sentiment to soften slightly in June. In July, August, and September, some traders from Wuxi sold some contracts, while others continued to buy, resulting in a state of mutual rejection. If the weather remains unchanged, the market may gradually weaken. As a result, the price for this month fell by 0.04 yuan compared to the previous week, June fell by 0.02 yuan, July fell by 0.01 yuan, August rose by 0.01 yuan, and September remained unchanged. In the spot wheat market, high-grade wheat prices remained stable due to strong factory demand, while medium-grade wheat prices were low and weak. Qingjiangpu, Suzhou, Xuzhou, and Bengbu wheat were offered at 5 taels and 1 qian; Shashi wheat was offered at 4 taels and 7.5 qian, with a total of 18,000 bags. Fuxin handled 14,000 bags, and Fufeng handled 4,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Foreign Firms Closed for Holiday, No Market for Silk</h3>
<p>▲ Regular Business to Resume Today</p>
<p>Yesterday, local foreign firms observed a holiday for Christmas, customs were closed, and there was no market for foreign exchange. The silk market remained closed. Today (the 22nd), foreign firms will resume business, and the silk market will return to normal.</p>
<h3>Recent News on Anhui and Jiangxi Tea</h3>
<p>▲ Qimen Black Tea Gardens Have Opened The weather has warmed up in the past ten days, with frequent rainfall, causing the tea buds to develop rapidly. The earliest gardens can be opened recently. Local farmers are concerned that the tea will grow too quickly and that they will not be able to pick and process it in time. Fortunately, the weather turned cold yesterday, slowing down the growth of the tea leaves and preventing them from becoming too mature. Currently, Wufuqi tea firms in Jingzhen are purchasing rice, but the city has banned its export, preventing its shipment. This has caused the firms to be stranded in Jingzhen and extremely anxious. They are urgently requesting that the city's Party Committee and the Fuliang County government provide assistance, as the tea picking and processing season is approaching and cannot be delayed. It is reported that the county government has agreed to find a solution, and as soon as permission to transport is granted, they will be able to enter the mountains and start production.</p>
<p>▲ Anren Tea Expected to Open for Sale Soon Anren is an important tea-producing area in Jiangxi Province, with a production volume comparable to Yushan and Dexing. The tea leaves in this area sprout after the spring and summer harvests, and can be picked and sold three or four times until the fall. Tea firms from Dexing, Hekou, Yushan, and Yangzhuang often send personnel to Anren to purchase tea. In recent years, due to poor export sales, the sales of Yangzhuang firms have decreased. Although domestic stores and firms still have strong demand, the low selling price has not benefited the farmers much. This year, the tea leaves in this area have developed quite early. Farmers are rushing to pick and process the tender buds. A few gardens have already opened. Tea stores and vendors from this province have been sending their employees to the mountains to search for and buy tea. It is expected that sales will begin in about a week. (13th)</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Active Procurement in the Street</h3>
<p>▲ Over 200 Pieces of Eastern Goods Sold Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Hangzhou to Collect Special Tax in Advance, Accelerating Shipments</p>
<p>The past few days have been Western holidays, and most firms have stopped business, resulting in a very dull piece goods market. Although firms resumed business yesterday, banks remained closed, so only goods in stock at local warehouses could be shipped. Transactions involving bank transfers were still suspended. On the customer sales side, activity was slightly higher due to the lack of arrivals in recent days. Slightly more members of the Cotton Cloth Association arrived yesterday. Over 200 pieces of eastern goods were sold in the street, most of which were transported to Hangzhou due to the upcoming special tax in that area. As a result, shipments were accelerated. Printed linen yarn was shipped in large quantities, with San Ma Tou (brand) at 2 qian, 2 fen, and 7.5 li, Xiang Meiren (brand) at 2 qian and 2.5 fen, and Yang Guifei (brand) at 2 qian and 1.5 fen. Raw foreign yarn continued to fall. Dian Qiuxiang (brand) opened at 8 taels and 3.5 qian, and Tang Taizong (brand) at 8 taels and 2.5 qian, and they were slightly easier to sell. Redyed goods from local factories sold for around 6 taels. Blue-striped serge sold quite well, with Zijinshan (brand) at 1 qian and 6.5 fen, Ersunfu (brand) at 1 qian, 6 fen, and 2.5 li, and Xiaojie Tu (brand) at 1 qian, 7 fen, and 2.5 li. Over 100 pieces were sold, mostly purchased by local traders. However, customers from other regions were still lifeless. There were no additional purchases from the Yangtze River region, except for a few replenishments from Ningbo traders.</p>

<h3>Group News</h3>
<p>▲ The Jiande Savings Association announced that the Hangzhou tour organized by the association departed on the express train on the 17th. About 150 people joined, some staying at the association's branch in Hangzhou and others staying in hotels. Most people were divided into small groups for independent tours. The tour group arrived safely at the North Station last night at around 9:00 PM.

The company is well-organized and specializes in collecting difficult debts for all businesses. The fees are lower than those charged by debt collection agencies established by foreigners. There are two types of contracts: annual and temporary. If litigation is involved, the company will also fully bear the lawyer's fees, litigation fees, and all other fees, in order to demonstrate its commitment to protecting the interests of merchants. Shanghai's commerce is thriving, and there are many debts. Since the company's opening, there has been a surge in the number of people entrusting it with business.</p>
<p>▲ Rongchangxiang of Nanjing Road announced that it is holding a one-month price reduction to benefit Western suit customers. The store anticipated the sharp rise in gold prices last year and purchased a large batch of woolens and ordered a large quantity of new goods from well-known foreign woolen mills. Therefore, its cost is 70-80% cheaper than current market prices. Due to the store's large inventory and low purchase prices, it is taking this opportunity to hold a special three-week sale. Yesterday was the first day of the store's price reduction, and customers were extremely crowded. The most popular items were the French wool suits for 26 yuan and the fancy wool suits for 32 yuan. Other items, such as woolen hats and miscellaneous items, were discounted by 20-10%.</p>
<p>▲ The Zhongbiao Advertising Painting Agency announced that since its establishment, its business has been developing rapidly, and it has been receiving so many orders for various types of paintings that it is overwhelmed.

<p>▲ The Paris Grand Theatre announced that the long-awaited epic film "The Cossacks," based on Tolstoy's immortal masterpiece and starring the two major stars John Gilbert and Renee Adoree in their first major contribution since "The Big Parade," with thousands of troops, a magnificent scale, and beautiful scenery, is a must-see film during this pleasant spring season.

<p>▲ The Xifan Film Company announced that its new film "The Three Knights-Errant" is a martial arts and love drama directed by the martial arts director Hu Junzongli. The film's lead actress, Wang Feijuan, plays the female knight Xia Gu, who is able to sacrifice love and help her father to be enemies with her lover, and then kill her father. The so-called father is not her biological father, but her sworn enemy. The strangeness of the plot can be seen from this.

<h3>Publishing News</h3>
<p>▲ The China Child Welfare Association announced that, during the Child Welfare Games held by the association last year, Mrs. Tao Aider, the representative of the American Child Welfare Cause, was sent to China to specially promote the Early Motherhood Group. The purpose was to organize young women to study the responsibilities of motherhood, not only to know the way to health, but also to know how to raise children in the future, which is contrary to the Chinese Eastern Ethics of "no one learns to raise children before marrying." Dr. Booker Joseph of the United States, with 20 years of experience, wrote the book "Early Motherhood Group," which, in addition to various methods for organizing the group, details the three major questions of why, how, and what should be the responsibilities of raising children.

<h3>The Whispers in the Park · Shi Duo</h3>
<p>After lunch, I hurried out of my residence and headed towards Jess Field Park. On the way, I was contemplating how to spend this intoxicating spring afternoon. I planned to take a stroll around the park first, then find a quiet corner, sit down quietly surrounded by greenery, and carefully read a rainbow-colored shield. If I felt like it, I wouldn't even go back for dinner, but wait there for the moon to rise, so that I could reminisce about the unbearable past in the serene night air. Thinking of this, a feeling of ease passed through my chest, and even my breathing seemed smoother.</p>
<p>Arriving at the park gate, I was met by a park guard. Instinctively, I reached into my pocket, preparing to take out my Season Ticket for him to inspect. But after searching all over, I still couldn't find it. Only then did I remember that my ticket was in another coat pocket and I hadn't brought it. Embarrassed, my face flushed repeatedly. I had no choice but to take out twenty cents and walk back to the ticket booth. "What bad luck, wasting this money," I thought to myself as I received the ticket.</p>
<p>As soon as I entered the park gate, a cluster of trees in front of me created a kind of pressure on my mind. When I walked beneath them, I stood there sadly for a long time, looking left and right, as if this place was unfamiliar to me. But that wasn't the case. As I stood there, a unique feeling suddenly came over me. I felt that every leaf and tree here was very lovely. And the birds jumping on the branches, leaking a delicate song from the leaves, made me even more intoxicated. After a long while, I reluctantly walked past.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I emerged from a corner of the park and walked to a unique stone bridge in the park. I saw a group of people leaning on the bridge railing, intently looking down below. Everyone's eyes were focused on a somersaulting mouse, and laughter and the sound of gongs mingled together. I casually walked past, taking about a dozen steps forward, and the lively scene in the center of the park unfolded before my eyes. Small, old, tall, short, red, and green, people crisscrossed, forming a picture of a thriving spring. At that moment, I felt that this park was different. The situation of loneliness and tranquility that had been locked up in the past could only be found in memory now. Thinking this, I walked to a pool of lake water in the middle of the park. At this time, seven or eight foreign children were standing by the lake, exposing their knees, with their sleeves rolled up high, playing with their small sailboats. Groups of people were also crowding on the shore, as if their purpose in coming here was to watch this show.</p>
<p>From there, I went back into the corner of the park. Under the protection of the greenery, I walked slowly, step by step. The spring breeze blew gently, dispelling the stuffiness from my body. I felt a little happy and wanted to find a comfortable seat nearby to sit down quietly and read. However, looking around, all the seats had been occupied by those who were quick on their feet. Disappointed, I had no choice but to continue walking forward. After walking a dozen steps, I could faintly see several cars parked outside the park through the gaps in the greenery. At the same time, the sound of car horns was constantly coming one after another. It turned out that the main gate on the east side was ahead. At this time, tourists poured in from the main gate like a tide, each one bracing themselves and walking quickly into the park.</p>
<p>I stood under a tree, staring blankly. Suddenly, my heart darkened. This group of leisurely people only gave me a suffocating sadness. I felt the gray side of life, and I also felt the glorious corner of life. Ah, life, the cursed urban life. I sighed deeply and turned to walk west. Suddenly, I felt a ray of light coming towards me. It turned out that a fiery sun was already hanging high in the treetops to the west, dyeing everything in the park crimson red.</p>
<p>After running around in the park for a while, I still couldn't get rid of a kind of inexplicable accumulated depression. The lovers holding hands, the charming soft laughter, the simple and noisy commotion—all of these made me resentful. Finally, I walked to a grove of trees in the corner of the park and sat down, intending to rest quietly from then on. However, after sitting for only a few seconds, the buzzing sound that filled the entire space drove me out of the park.</p>
<h3>The Mysterious Eastern Island · Liang Xiong Wan</h3>
<p>Twelve scientists from the University of Pennsylvania in the United States will depart next spring for Eastern Island, one of the most mysterious places in the South Pacific. This trip may be able to provide a satisfactory solution to the mysteries that scientists have considered inexplicable on this desolate island for two hundred years.</p>
<p>The area of ​​this desolate island is very small, so there are not many indigenous people living there. Along the winding shore are countless tombstones, relics of a long-forgotten people. No one now knows what kind of people built these tombstones, or what era they were built in.</p>
<p>Eastern Island is a triangular volcanic area with an area of ​​only forty-five square miles. Its neighboring islands (approximately two thousand miles from the Chilean coast and one thousand miles west of Eastern Island) are desolate and remote places on earth, uninhabited by anyone.</p>
<p>Eastern Island is very remote from transportation routes, so in 1922, a Spanish exploration ship failed to find it. In the same year, after an earthquake occurred on the island, it took several months to correct the shipowner's report—the island of the dead was lost. Only a few explorers have been there. What they found there is one of the most interesting and unresolved mysteries in the world.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing is the magnificent ancient tombs, of which there are two hundred and sixty, some of which are three hundred feet long and fifteen feet high, with an altar one hundred feet wide in front for people to worship their ancestors. There are more than six hundred tall half-body stone statues on the island. No one has yet found out who carved these stone statues from volcanic rock, or why they carved them like this.</p>
<p>The location of these solemn-faced stone statues (the largest of which are thirty feet high and weigh forty to two hundred and fifty tons) is not fixed. It is said that these many stone statues were used as decorations for tombs, with oval stone slabs lining the tombs. A fisherman who had been there one hundred and fifty years ago saw countless stone idols standing along the shore, facing away from the sea. He was surprised and felt a lot of interest in these things.</p>
<p>These strange-shaped stone corners are generally more than two thousand to five thousand years old. It is possible that their age could be even higher. Are they idols, images of gods for people to pray to, or images of ancient heroes, or images of ancestors? There are no satisfactory answers to these questions.</p>
<p>There are three volcanic craters on the island. The rocks next to the volcanic craters are the raw materials used by the long-forgotten people to carve stone idols. Next to the Lara Ku volcanic crater, there are still many unfinished stone idols placed there. But we are a little skeptical here. In ancient times or the Middle Ages, when machines had not been invented, how did the stonemasons move the completed stone idols from the volcanic crater to the foot of the mountain? This is what we do not understand. Now, many heavy tools have been found on the mountainside and next to the volcanic crater. This is obviously the remains of the workers hundreds of years ago. Moreover, most of the stone statues next to the volcanic crater have not been completed. This can further show that the work at that time must have been stopped by some kind of magic.</p>
<p>Was this demon war, plague, famine, or a special natural disaster that wiped out all these workers? No one knows these things. Although there are many speculations, some people say that this was caused by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, but he cannot provide geographical evidence to confirm his statement. If an earthquake were to really occur and a volcano were to really erupt, the stone statues and altars and other relics would have long been reduced to pieces, or if they were not broken, they would have been covered by volcanic lava.</p>
<p>In order to break the various mysteries of Eastern Island, the University of Pennsylvania's expedition this time will take a long time to prepare everything. A specially made motor ship worth US$1.5 million will be completed in the near future for this expedition. The ship has been named "Caroline" and is two hundred and fifty feet long. It was donated by Earl Dyer Johnson, a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania and manager of the Victoria Phonograph Company. He will depart for Eastern Island on the same ship as the expedition team.</p>
<p>The most important mission of this expedition is to solve the origin of the Eastern Island natives. Where did these island people come from? How did they get to this remote island? Did they migrate here from "Chile" in South America or "</p>
<p>[Note: There is a break in the text here with partially visible Chinese characters which cannot be translated.]</p>
<p>"Secret"? Or did they live on Amo Island?</p>
<p>There are currently two hundred native Hawaiians living on the island. They do not understand much about the mysterious cemetery of their ancestors, nor do they care about it. They may be the descendants of the original inhabitants of this island, but we cannot say that for sure, because they do not have traditional culture for us to refer to. This expedition will definitely make many contributions to us. Please wait and see with your eyes wide open.</p>
