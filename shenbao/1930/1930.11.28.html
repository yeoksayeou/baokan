<h3>打破經濟難局</h3>
<p>今日各强國謀所以打破經濟難局者。目的不外乎推廣國外之市塲。使壅塞停滯之商業得以向外發展而其向外發展之目的。又皆不外乎遠東之中國。然而中國在此民窮財盡之情勢下。購買力巳甚薄弱。使各强國皆以對華貿易爲目的。　聚各貨物於中國之一市塲。　以互相角逐爭吸中國人之資財。則中國之市塲必坍。中國之市塲坍。華商固不能立足。而外商又有何利。故今日爲外商計。不能祗圖救己國之難關。祇知謀片面之利益。而當謀所以兩利之道。以共渡此經濟上之難關蓋須知中國之市塲。自以中國人之商業爲主要。中國人經濟之盈虚爲消息。各國外商之欲向中國發展。須先明白與中國商業有共存共榮之必要。能先從相互之利害上。研究所以相維相繫之方法。使華商有共同發展之機會。而後市塲乃得伴以發展。若外商祇圖巳國貿易之發達。而不代謀華商之便利甚者非特不代謀便利且出種種手段。以壓迫而妨害焉。則華商固將無力與之競爭而倒。而長袖善舞之外商。亦安能獨存於中國之市塲。是故今日所謂經濟難關。爲各國同處之難關。欲打破此難關。惟有同力合作之一法。若一國欲倖逃此難關。而不恤使他國之難關愈陷愈深。此必非正當之法也。竊願世之言打破難關者。其知所注意焉。</p>

<p>自何應欽氏任訓練總監後。頒令高中以上學生須受二年軍事訓練。我民立中學。積極實行。成績卓著。軍事敎官劉鳳麟。敎練主嚴格而重實行。爰於月之二十一日。率赴浦東楊思橋野外演習。特購爆竹五十元。作僞子彈。是日。天高氣爽。風和日麗。上午八時三連健兒。即整列塲上。精神煥發。第一連咸荷槍戎裝。第二三兩連。則負水瓶乾糧袋等。袋内儲麵包水果。以供午餐旌旗獵獵。軍樂洋洋聲中。劉敎官率領出發軍樂隊首列前行。沿途軍容壯嚴。步伐整齊。令人肅然起敬。洎至高昌廟江邊碼頭。乃買棹渡江共舵舟七艘。蕩漾江心。極目四眺。兩岸景物。一覽無餘。水聲潺潺。與風聲颯颯相應答。沿岸軍艦輪舟。停泊櫛比總理誕日下水之逸仙艦。亦泊於此。遙見該艦　漆鮮麗。殊爲雄壯無何。巳抵浦東周家渡。舍舟登陸。向楊思橋進發。步行二里許。劉敎官即令第一連第一排爲前衛隊。單行前進。以探前方敵人有無埋伏並派步哨二人。鵠立土丘以資守望。後方隊伍。則分領爆竹。準備野戰。各班均置號兵一人。爲司號當前衛兵將引誘旗招搖時步哨即馳回報告發現敵人。劉敎官遂指揮各排長。率領部下散兵於鐵路二旁墳墓高處。各班士兵。均埋伏於後。燃點爆竹開始射擊。一時砰訇之聲。如霆如雷。烟霧迷漫不啻置身於槍林彈雨之塲。忽聞進軍號。各班士兵。亦影響鼓吹。我軍傴僂執槍。奮勇衝鋒。殺聲震天。勢如脫兎。約數百武。仍擇地隱伏。繼續射擊約二十分鐘。及歸隊軍號大作。乃掩旗息鼓。歸隊集合。衆皆泥汚遍身。演習巳畢。逕往楊思橋楊思小學内休息。各出所携麵包聊爲午餐。小息一時餘。遂整隊點名。由劉敎官訓話。嘉勉有加。歸途仍精神奕奕。毫無倦容。返校。巳夕陽西下矣。</p>

<h3>個展紀趣</h3>
<p>— 俞劍華</p>
<p>不才近年來。以家庭劇變。環境壓迫。舉一切苦惱悲憤。無可告訴者。畢洩之于畫。抑鬱不平之氣爲之稍舒。而畫亦因之稍有進境。不過藝海汪洋。鼷鼠飲之。能有幾何。一得之愚。深願就正有道。故將近作百件。公開展覽。並特開預展。恭請海上名家指正。俾資遵循。謬蒙賞讚。藻飾過當。且爭訂出品。瞬息爲之一空。致使在開會時無以饜觀者之望。不得巳乃舉行第二次展覽會出品預定。以免向隅。不料未及二日。預定者巳超過百件。第二次開會之期定於陰歷十二月二十二十一兩天。爲期甚近。殊不敢貪多務得。草率從事以負雅意。乃將預定提前停止。第三日預定者不得不待者來年。而一日之間又預定至六十餘件。不才素以出品迅速見稱于儕輩。至此巳疲于應付。計開會三日。除出品百件。全數售罄外。更預定一百七十件之多。而參觀者竟達三千餘人。即前輩名家如程瑤笙氏亦且破格降臨。深恐才疏學淺。筆拙墨劣。無以符各界期望之殷惟有益自奮勉。殊不敢以此自滿也。此次出品中之三十三號南山翠屏與八十六號之秋江晚渡預定者爲最多。第一日各定至十四人。第二日三十三號增至十八人而八十六號增至二十四人。第三日三十三號增至二十九人。而八十六號竟增至四十五人。紅籤自軸至頂並排兩行至不能容。友人戲爲兩畫頗似賽馬中之大香賓。三十三號日人山田謙吉定一幅。八十六號則德人方哈樂定一幅。亦遙遙相對。次之則爲六十五號之松齋讀易十九人。號外第一江上三峯十人。而此四幅之原定者兩爲張善孖兄一爲張大千兄一爲黃賓虹社長。三人者又同居一宅。可謂奇矣。名家法眼。畢竟不凡。第二日之晨。方布置就緒。來觀者不過兩三人。而台上非賣品之册頁侍母集巳不翼而飛。大索不得。第三日友人自古玩茶會上來云。昨日有人持册頁兜售。索借兩百元。此公　篋之術。不讓妙手空空兒。惜余畫不値多金。未免錯用牛刀耳。</p>
<h3>梅蘭芳登臺先聲</h3>
<p>— 膽瓶室主</p>
<p>此來變更方針多唱舊劇</p>
<p>梅蘭芳去年演劇北歸後。曾有從此不再現色相之宣言。滬上好曲之士。聞此消息。無不意興索然。今則佳音傳來。梅氏又將蒞滬歌唱。與滬人士作最後之周旋則此次梅氏之登臺。更値得使吾人有興奮之價値矣。聞梅氏此來。擬變更方針。多唱舊劇而少演新戲。如宇宙鋒全本雪杯緣玉堂春女起解四郎探母霸王别姬祭江十三妹貴妃醉酒諸劇。將依次排演。以應各界之需求。（蓓開公司有梅之探母宇宙鋒女起解剌湯别姬諸片。銷路奇旺。於此可證顧曲界對於舊劇之歡迎矣。）至自排之全部楊貴妃一劇。取材正大。編制得宜。在平津一帶。每次出演。必售滿座。其魔力並不見弱於舊劇。故此來亦擬從事排演。俾愛觀新劇者。亦不至有向隅之憾云。（梅在蓓開所灌三本楊貴妃。有白有唱。結構極佳。二黃奪板腔調新穎。爲全部楊貴妃最有精采之一段）</p>
<h3>遣妾記</h3>
<p>— 顏也</p>
<p>海上寓公。有張某者。某年曾綰軍符。汗馬之餘。能草露布。尤工詩雍雍有儒將之稱。今旣解職。益以詩酒自娛。暮境至足樂也。張有兩妾係姊妹花。乃當年其友購自倡門中以獻之者。深得張之寵幸。焚茗添香。不離左右。出亦挾以俱行。春秋佳日。吾蘇浙之名由勝水間。時有彼輩足跡。望之若仙侶也。今歲秋。張又携兩妾至西子湖頭。寓其友人家。數日之間。踏遍南北高峯某日至靈隱。周覽旣竟。將出。一僧忽趨前合十曰。大人西湖之游樂乎、湖濱往來。有女同車。水上容與。載得西子。誠神仙中人也。張爲之愕然。注視久之。似曾相識。曰汝其某乎。今何僧也。僧曰然。余固大人某日部下之團長也。來此巳三易寒暑矣。詢其緣何入空門。則笑而不言。惟轉詢張之居處。張悵悵返寓。自此游興大殺。蟄居三日。忽綠衣人來。致張一函。展視之寥寥數字。閲竟。擊案怒。繼而啞然。終且揮淚。隨以書付諸火。即匆匆率兩妾歸海上。人咸爲之驚異不止。張返滬後。夜出不歸。翌晨歸來。探懷出二千金置兩女前令各取半曰。今别矣。若曹携去。其同返故里。有此鄉居。一生足矣。世界花花。留戀無益。倡門中更是地獄。毌再墮落也。二女不欲行。泣下如雨張絶無憐惜意。反厲色促首途。二女知不可留。即各携所需細軟偕哭去。及門猶返首。張則目笑送之。連呼解脫解脫。二女旣去。張終日書空咄咄。不十日。别家人出迄今兩月。不知所之。余聞之。曰此奇事也。因記之。</p>
<h3>南洋游記（八五）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>七月二日雨。欲遊動物園。不通土語。尋不着而返。楊江水君來。願率往。乃與同去。出二十二條支那街。上白塔路。電車每人二枚銅元。仰光電車不如日本上海電車中人之擁擠。賣票人亦老成。招待客人亦從容。我中國國民程度莫言如暹邏。尙在緬甸人以下耳。不信試于開電車工人而比較知之。路經英女皇維多利亞所辦佛敎男學校。此外尙有維皇所辦佛敎女校。此亦　縻緬人之一法與。到大金塔下車。再坐一小馬車。兩人三安拿士。凡十二枚銅元。即到動物園。道路甚淸潔。森林大湖繞園旁。但余初無指導人。咫尺地不能尋得。一汽車索余兩盾之價。每盾値中國一元三角也。嗚呼。大道妙境。只在目前。得人指導則易人。無人辭摸。則迷途。于此可悟世界非有大導師不可矣。入門票二安拿。每安四枚也。此園爲東亞名園。規模頗可觀。建築有異點。與北京之萬牲園大異。彼雖有多數動植物。但此地建築管理大可參考。願將來遊人注意之。因住動物不易得飼養。管理建築術大要研究也。但其地點雖大。而動物品類不多耳。</p>
<p>入園先見數獅蒼灰色。牝牡之大小亦略等。次則數老虎。人言虎頭有王字。信然。此間房舍一切。皆下面留空以避濕氣。虎舍亦然。居于地板上。遺糞須工人掃而洗之。工人欲人虎舍。先以鐵棍騙衆虎入内室。虎入後。其室内鐵關忽然自上落下。工人乃得入而掃糞。但此法頗不靈巧。似須另想較好之法也。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（三二三）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十六回　殷勤問字翠袖謁先生　慷慨談兵靑樓宴女傑</p>
<p>那班以文字爲生涯的人。大半都是患着胃病的。再要吃了那種包飯。更敎人不舒服了。若是家裏吃了夜飯出來。時間上又夠不到。回去得遲。肚子裏可不要打饑荒。雖然偶爾也有應酬。或有人請報館裏的先生們吃夜飯。這是特别難得的事。因爲從前一般社會中人。對於報界。也沒有現在那般重視。政界中人。目之爲斯文敗類。一般普通人。也說他們在那裏瞎三話四。並不知道新聞紙是個宣傳機關。請報館先生吃一頓飯。有多大的效力。而從前的新聞記者。倒也不肯輕易吃人家的飯。好像吃了人家的飯。糊了自己的嘴。必須有人介紹。明白事實。决不肯招之即來。揮之不去。倒要搭一點松香架子。有些崖岸自高的樣子。却沒有像現在那般和易近人。更有兩位先生。絶對不向外界應酬。寗可在斗室中。燒洋火爐。吃茶泡飯。絶不願以新聞記者的名義。招搖過市的。所以爲了這吃夜飯問題。最好是二三知交。把酒談心。好在上海的館子旣多。今晚吃這家。明晚又吃那家。所費不多。每晚又可以換換口味。這也算是友朋之樂了。只是左詩晨這一連幾夜的夜飯吃下來。無一天不和綠意見面。人到了一熟以後。所有羞澀之態。也驅除凈盡了。從前堂唱來了。總是默坐一傍。俯首弄伊的手帕。你向伊看看。伊也向你笑笑。問伊一句話。伊也至多回答你一句。有時伊那回答你的一句話。縮成了兩個字。一個字。再問下去。索性沒有字了。或者點一點頭。或者搖一搖頭。以表示伊的是與非了。好容易這五六晚的工夫。似好古家的盤弄古玉一般。漸漸兒有些盤熟了。到了檯面上。也漸漸有說有笑。加着有個阿素在傍邊。似音樂家伴奏似的。因爲綠意還有一個缺點。是不大會唱的。伊雖然也能哼幾句。但自以爲唱得不好。就有點兒怕唱。這却和左詩晨的脾氣相合。左詩晨說。我就是不懂唱的。不懂就是不懂。何必充什麽假内行。有時來了一個善於唱的。也能抑揚頓挫。四座擊節。自然是很好的了。聽的人旣覺有味兒。唱的人也加添了興緻。要是那種不大能唱的人。却敎伊勉爲其難。弄得面紅頸赤。力竭聲嘶。而唱出來的曲子。還是有點兒不入調。那不如自己藏拙點就是咯。</p>

<h3>糧食米市天陰轉穩</h3>
<p>閘北昨各路到船約計四五十號、惟市銷因天陰而活動各方買氣極佳常帮白粳見昻角許特頂又將達十五元關口、普通等交易甚佳、但至午間銷胃巳淡大勢殊不易向上、薄稻到接銷淡價因粳穏而站立、羊秈去化極殷、行情趨緊角半杜尖客埠尖悉提一角統市零胃甚爽、故情况俏俐、變元因上兩市堅漲、酒胃等反覺不振、價格遂小兩角、陰元仍開十三元左右、</p>
<p>滬南昨日河下到船三十餘號、本街走銷在晨間因天陰大爽、各價悉行上漲、午間晴正又轉平定、白粳因此有角半之上落、結果與上日相同、餘如蘇同等白粳初亦極俏、旋即呈呆、南帮薄稻甬銷與店銷微動、但喝盤殊緊、目下特頂祗開十二元之譜羊杜各尖據内地消息市形漸堅申銷雖不開展、大勢則不易過跌、頂杜尖仍須十二元零耳、通變此間極形凋零、市甚寂靜、陰化到源較接、各胃不一、盤面無甚上落、</p>
<h3>客元北銷甚佳</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、仍居平勢、到貨逐有小票到下、去路昨市稍佳、統市開出江西機早五百包、價十元○二角七分至十元○五分、南京糙米四百包、價八元九角至八元六角四分、江西機元五百十包、價十四元二角半至十四元○五分贛元盡係北洋帮辦去、機早爲本街與厦門帮分去、糙米亦爲本街辦去、以本客均有辦胃、市形似看佳象但均吃價甚緊、行情依然未有轉好也、</p>
<h3>粉市近固遠懈</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、在盤旋之中、微呈近穏遠軟之象、本月份雖近交割、惟各大廠家之現貨始終未見湧積、故交割數量、將來恐屬無幾市勢之盤穏殖即此故、至還期各月份、雖洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、互有一二角上落但以買氣甚寂、人心轉懈、觀此後局面、因廠家之抛貨巳少、此　市况、暫須停頓也、結果本月份較前日微好七厘半十二月份好二厘半、正·二月份小五厘三月份小二厘半、四月份小七厘半云、</p>
<h3>麥市閑散</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市頉上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致均趨停頓因洋麥報價、互有出人、致各月份之交易巳轉冷淡市面亦鮮出入觀此後如洋麥無劇殊之變動此後之標準行情、或可告一段落也結果十二月份較前日回好二分、正二月份不動、三月份小一分四月份未動、現麥市面以洋麥步步進口、各廠進胃甚覺懈怠、故全市又無做開云、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白跌後轉挺</h3>
<p>昨日糖市產區電訊、古巴現糖價爲一·四○六二五、比前電回跌三一二五、紐約期糖十二月份價一·二九、跌一分、明年三月份價一·四二、五月份一·五○九月份一·六三、均跌三分、爪哇現糖價七·八七五、期糖十二月及正月份價均七·八七五、比前仍乏升降、公會粗砂白出貨頗湧、而買氣亦活、成交價爲七兩四錢半、高貨七兩四錢七分半、路貨明後日可到者、劃七兩四錢、交易頗盛、磨細砂白七兩五錢半、二十號中砂白六兩六錢七分半、進出稍懈、東糖交易亦轉活潑、Ｎ嘜七兩六錢半ＹＰ嘜七兩八錢二分半、明治貨七兩八錢七分半、ＹＰＯ嘜六兩九錢、明華貨七兩ＴＭ嘜七兩零二分半、ＹＴ嘜七兩四錢七分半、均見穏秀號盤有錦發號開出現貨粗砂白一千袋、價七兩四錢半、市氣尙濃、旋即售通、本廠氷自上海廠開跌一錢後昨日南陽及中華二廠出品今將亦見跟落、中字冰十兩零七錢、華字十兩零六錢、銷路尙覺活潑云、</p>
<h3>絲茶皖秋繭價難上漲</h3>
<p>滬市各絲廠因遵官廳之勸告、巳有一部份勉力復工、而原料無着、所有抵押與銀行之乾繭、均因工潮之可慮、相戒不敢交廠繅製、是以開工之絲廠祗得在市補購原料奈絲市不振、繭價仍難上漲、昨日閘北某廠進皖秋繭三百五十擔、七百四十斤繅折、價祗七十九兩絲本淨扯巳須六百兩弱、外加繅工、廠方仍須虧本數十兩云、</p>
<h3>茶市續趨沉靜</h3>
<p>昨日路莊土莊兩路之珍眉綠茶、仍無大宗銷路、上星期發出電報多數未見回音、貢熙綠茶、俄莊進意亦轉淸淡、日來多有過磅惟俄國協助會對於茶價、旣極苛緊、扣除樣欠、又復過鉅、頗爲華茶商所不滿、此外祁寗紅茶、英俄莊亦均觀望、市况殊形寥落云、</p>
<h3>疋頭呢絨内地帮交易暢旺</h3>
<p>呢羢毛貨、日來走銷甚廣而以首都·蕪湖·鎭江·蘇州·無錫·杭州·寗波等内地小客帮交易爲最暢、其號主親自蒞滬選配及快函囑購者日有數起、如毡呢尺六絨大衣呢華特呢花呢之類俱有需要、大半均現欵交易、惜除大衣呢外、其他一無原箱胃口、蓋國歷年關將近人心多數不敢盡量再進、但雖拆疋零剪生意、然其𤍠閙忙碌則非昔比矣</p>
<h3>油市柏油市氣秀麗</h3>
<p>蔴城新貨尙未上市…川占漢盤緊俏</p>
<p>柏油市仍堅挺名重枝售價巳至十八兩、藏城油產區地隣漢　、往歲斯時新油陸續可到今歲亦因匪勢甚熾、產區行客類率遠遷、致新貨尙未登場、查近年柏油洋銷日衰、而内銷皂廠需要激增、情况適呈背馳、惟内銷交易、不若洋莊恒有整數買賣、故市面尙平、</p>
<p>川占交易尙暢、廣帮續有談判、行盤仍須一百十兩、漢市正米售至一百廿三兩至一百十九兩、慶申永牌一百零五兩至零三兩、</p>

<h3>交大之游泳運動</h3>
<p>交大對於游泳運動之設備、非常完善、本年游泳競賽、敗於曁南後、益覺非努力練習、難以雪恥、於是有𤍠化游泳池之計劃、其法往游泳池底、裝置𤍠水管、使池中水溫度常在攝氏十五度左右、在嚴冬時、池之四圍、復須裝電爐、是以雖在極冷時候、猶可練習不斷、該校游泳隊、旣得有此種特别設備後、益形努力、特規定每星期一三五爲隊員練習時期、屆時由隊長點名、凡一學期不缺席者、由體育主任奬勵、凡缺席一次者、由隊長口頭警告、兩次者書面警告、三次以上由隊長請體育主任書面警告、若再不理、則以退出該隊論、而該生之體育分數、即以不及格論矣、隊員均能遵守章程、努力練習、二月以來、未嘗有缺席者、因此成績大有進步、茲將各該隊員之成績述之如後、</p>
<p>葉氏昆仲　葉杭爲兄、葉梧爲弟、二葉練習之勤、爲各隊員冠、大葉二百米之Crawl巳可在江大紀錄之時間内游到、且姿勢極佳、假以時日、定可有驚人之紀錄、小葉係長距離游泳、現經該校主何授以美國最新採用之Long　Distance　Crawl法、葉氏練習純熟、日有進步、三千米可在三十三分鐘内游到、與江大紀錄相差無幾、</p>
<p>凌崇舉君　凌君係該校前校長現隴海鐵路工程局長凌鴻勳之猶子、天在游泳巧技、復生長廣東、日江海爲伴、自被選爲隊員後、亦甚形努力、二百米蛙式能在一分二十七杪游到、打破江大紀錄、</p>
<p>以上三君、爲該校游泳隊之皎皎者、現均有指定講師之指導、並聞該校體育堂商、以爲游泳運動、尤在體力充實、爲充實隊員體力計、特請校醫定出隊員起居飲食規則十條、以資遵守、規則大意、爲起居爲定時、飲食如何節制等、又該隊隊員之膳食、亦由學校當局借給、以資營養豐富云、</p>
<h3>復旦出版物一瞥</h3>
<p>— 彬</p>
<p>復旦的同學、男女不下千餘人、研究文藝素有著績者實有不少、所以、在過去兩年中、傾重文藝的小刋物、曾經風行於一時、如「現代文藝、」「朝日、」「幽默、」「當代文藝」等、在出版當初、頗得海上文壇的注目、畢竟因爲經濟的關係、出版數期之後、都先後的停刋了、但是它底著績、在出版界的史蹟上、我們是不能全部埋默、不過問世不久便停刋、這實是很値得嘆惜的事、現在、關於文藝及其它的出版物、又如雨後春荀般的突起來了、因爲出版期短、或許外界尙有不知者、現在將它底内容略寫梗槪、以供同好、</p>
<p>甲、洪流　這是攻擊普羅文學最烈的一種、雖然祇出版了創刋號、但是頗引起同學及外界的注目、因爲其中有幾篇論普羅文學的沒落的文章、統是很合於情理、將過去一般普羅刋物作全部的批判、顯然含有深沉的眼光、對於現今的出版界是異常的熟悉、决非謾駡的偶然產生的作品可比、有一篇批評「文藝講座」的文章、將其中每篇都提出作客觀的批判、當然指示出百般的錯誤、因爲所謂馬克思的論著、祇有欺朦一般盲從的靑年、稍有深刻學識者、决不致受彼等的狂呔所誘惑、所以在劃淸思想的現今、像這類的批判文字、是非常需要它底產生、至少、它底力量、是可以指示愛好文藝的靑年們一條正確思想的進路、同時、該刋對於民族主義文藝亦表示贊同、不過他們的態度、未有明澈的顯露、一個出版物、總有它所主張的目標、决不能含糊的從事、僅以這一點、我們引以爲缺憾、</p>
<p>乙、火伴這是一種純文藝刋物、内容包括小說、詩歌、散文之類、每篇作品、都具有向上的意識、對於普羅文學、亦抱着不滿的旨趣、不過他們沒有整個批判文章發表、但僅出版一期、或以後有此項文字發現、同時、這也是我們所企望的、</p>
<p>丙、社會學系半月刋這是社會學系系友會出版部所主編的半月刋、巳出版兩期、内容極形豐富、撰稿者由師生合作、研究社會科學者、此刋極可參考、這一二兩期的要目摘錄於下、一、應成一的「何謂眞理、」蕭遠的「團體衝突原理、」陳浴春的「本能習慣與智慧之關係、」王在勤的「動物社會學、」李洪聲的「現代社會文化現象論、」陳培森的「同盟罷工研究、」毛起　的「復旦大學調查上海黃包車夫收入計劃、」每篇文章、立論大都精密正確、難能可貴、在這樣的小刋物中、能夠讀到强有力的論著、是很値得欣喜的、聞第三期不日亦可出版、内有應成一先生的「社會進化說之正誤」一文、是很可使我們注意的、</p>
<p>丁、新聞敎育之重要及其實施這是新聞學系謝主任的近作、由新聞學會印行、内容係說新聞敎育的重要、尤其在我國、此項敎育實有提倡的必要、其實施方面、則以本校新聞學系所主辦的學程爲歸依、並徵引各國新聞學系的設施、互相比較、這完全係謝主任將經騐所得、加以詳盡的發揮、國大學倘若開設新聞系者、此書實可作參考之助、因爲此類作品、在國内出版物中尙未發現、定價亦甚低廉、研究新聞或敎育學者亦可購閲、實能在其中取得相當的助益、</p>
<p>其它在籌備中的刋物、尙有多種、容後再將告與讀者、總之、像復旦這樣廣多的出版物、實堪引起外人的注目、即以上數種、在内容上、都屬於精采的一面、這也是値得我們讚頌的呢、</p>

<p>書報介紹</p>
<h3>前鋒月刊第二期</h3>
<p>— 高偉</p>
<p>現代書局發行</p>
<p>自從「前鋒月刋創刋號」出版以後、於是中國文壇的活躍更形深進了、這是必然的結果、固無足驚訝、在今日、一般愛好天藝的靑年轉而傾向於民族主義的文藝運動、實屬事實的客觀的條件所形成、所以羣相爭讀而接受、現在第二期巳出版了、内容要目有、傅彥長的「以民族意識爲中心的文藝運動」、陳抱一的「日本洋畫發展的槪况」、朱應鵬的「中國的繪畫與民族主義」、楊民威的「中國的陶瓷與民族主義」、李贊華的短篇創作「變動」、爭波的長篇創作「秀兒」（續）、及倜然的短篇譯作「守夜人」、李金髮的長篇譯作、「北京的未日」、都是些强有力的作品、</p>
<p>傅彥長的「以民族意識爲中心的文藝運動」、雖僅是一篇千來字的短文、但很切於恰當而說人所未說過的、作者衝砲就說、「以民族意識爲中心思想的文藝作品、在世界上最沒有地位的不得不推於們中國人爲第一了、我們中國人在常識上、最缺乏的也就是這個民族意識」、這是多麽對的、中國人如果有了民族意識的話、也决不至於被譏屑爲一盤散沙了、因爲有了民族意識、就會有激昻的集團行動、集團行動永遠是𤍠情的、於民族有利的、在目前、我們中國的文藝就是缺少了這一點、那傳統思想的包圍、實使我們痛心的、因之、我們要是想宣傳一種有力量的、於中國人有利益的思想、給一般民衆、那末、這思想一定要它是傳統思想的反面、才能集中起來爲民族作一致的行動、</p>
<p>……思想不問其深奥、只要是可以利用的、就是好的、我們中國人現在所需要的思想、只不過是可以利用的民族意識、</p>
<p>在我們這一羣的意見、文藝作品應該是集團之下的生活表現、决不是個人有福獨享的單獨行動、中國人的文藝作品、應該爲全體中國人所利用、决不客許衆人皆濁而唯我獨淸的自由思想、有人說、只要是中國人的文藝作品、沒有不傾向於民族主義的——我說、只要一看傳統的文學、就曉得這是不對的、現在中國文壇上正充滿了反民族主義的傳統思想的以個人爲中心思想的文藝作品、受了宣傳的中國民衆、因此這是一盤散沙、還是一堆不可利用的垃圾、中國民衆沒有集團的力理、在國際上、沒有地位、都是文藝作品口所宣傳出來的結果、</p>
<p>起來、宣傳、我們從事文藝作品的人請以民族意識爲中心思想而向上去努力吧、</p>
<p>陳抱一的「日本洋畫發展的槪况」、是寫日本洋畫壇的歷史及其現狀、作者寫此文的動機、是看到我國的洋畫運動雖有好幾年的歷史、却直到如今還是亭滯於有形無形之中、以與日本相比擬、誠不可同日而語了、因之、作者在開首很詳盡的把中國洋畫壇的情形指斥了一番、並從各方而的探索、認爲一爲着我們的社會、爲着我們的文化、似手應得不絶地圖藝術的向上、不絶地從事藝術的創作、以期現出廣大的效果來、爲要如此、我們全體上便應有互相的理解、在個人方面當求各自的向上、似平是自然的了、藝術之個人的向上、當然也成爲全體協力之一、雖然現在正是實際困難的時代、但是若果我們持有眞摯的心情、和明晣的認識、則到了幾時或許會突破種困難也未可知、當此之際、我們應當如何努力鍜成自己、如何共同努力以建成、中國的洋畫壇而增大我們新生的文化之光輝」、次而述及日本的洋畫的發展史和現狀、乃發現同是東方的民族、他們的顯赫、而我們的景象如何、能不内慚而反省、他們在請多困難中堅毅地作美術事業的建設、這種情形作爲民族性看也見有何等顯赫的優趣之點、至於作者在史實的叙述上、很是詳細、實足作爲我們的參考、</p>
<p>但繪畫旣亦屬藝術之一、抱一君所說的還少理論的闡明和對於實際工作的指呈、究竟中國的繪畫與民族主義有什麽關係呢、這我們接着便讀到朱應鵬的「中國的繪畫與民族主義」了、這是値得我們注意的、尤其一般研究藝術的人們、關於中國繪畫、籠統地說、固自有特殊　型式、特殊的技巧、特殊的材料、和世界各民族的繪畫都不同、是獨樹一幟的、因此、在一般觀念籠統的人們看來、便會以爲這些就是我們的民族藝術了、祗要加上民族主義的幌子、便算我們民族主義的繪畫了、作者對於這點就表示着、「這種籠統的觀念、正是民族主義文藝運動當前的荆棘、」所以、先把先决的原則確定了、然後討論到中國固有的繪畫、是不是從民族的立塲所形成的生活意識裏產生的呢、是不是對於自己民族意識地負起了「爲民族」的使命的呢、於是分二方面來研究、其一是思想問題、其二是技巧與型式問題、思想又可分爲二種、一種是封建思想、一種出世思想、封建思想的繪畫理論、可以陸士衡、曹植、謝赫、張彥遠、顧炎武……等爲代表、他們根本是封建政治的產物、出世思想的繪畫理論、則可以郭照、王微、張懷、蘇軾、倪瓚、董其昌、石濤等爲代表、其次、討論到技巧和型式、大槪在藝術中思想總是占了主要點的繪畫也一樣、思想可以產生技巧和型式、換言之技巧型式不過是一種表現的工具而巳、這些我們何都可以拿德意志的表現主義、法蘭西的純粹主義、意大利的未來主義、俄羅斯的原始主義等證明、因之、中國固有繪畫的技巧與型式就爲了封建思想和出世思想的關係、遂成爲裝飾風的和寫意的、這兩種傳統思想和它們所產生的技巧與型式所支配的中國固有的繪畫、絶對不能認爲民族的藝術、作者又從阻礙民族進展方面看、認爲中國固有的繪畫、對於人生的表現、毫不講求、那些畫家經這二種統思想所征服、對於人生便絶對不負責任、自命爲高尙的寫意的畫家、决不肯放棄了玩世不恭的態度、也决不會爲民衆的生活去打算盤了、因之、根據「民族主義文藝運動宣言」、應該起來努力排除、同時今後的中國繪畫、「不應該再在墮落的舊繪畫上求生路、而應該有新的認識與創造、在根本上應該確認藝術與人生必須打成一片、更應該從爲民族底目的裏迸出㶷烈的火花、洶湧的泉流」、而在表現上、則應該特别注里於、甲、民族的恥辱與苦難、乙、民族的原始的傳說、丙、民族奮鬭的歷史、丁、民族的實際生活、戊、物質文明的贊揚、這也可說是中圖繪畫的使命了、「我們對於繪畫需要有新的理解、新的情緒、新的思想、同時需要有新的材料、新的技巧與型式來作爲一切表現的工具、這種新的技巧與型式、應該是由畫家的努力創造、」呵、一般從事於繪畫國人們、不要單在陳舊的死路上瞎鑽了吧、請利用你們的創造力呢、來了、作者並確立我們繪畫的技巧型式底最低限度的原則、（一）以寫生爲基礎、（二）以發育健全爲人體標準美、（三）構圖須嚴整、（四）以刻意經營的態度去製作、（五）用色以光明𤍠烈爲主、（六）注重線條、（七）注重動的表現、</p>
<p>楊民威的「中國的陶瓷與民族主義先說明陶瓷與中華民族的關係、次而叙述中國陶資史的簡閲、從原始時代的土器、以至漢之陶磁、晋之縹瓷……元之陶磁、明之陶磁、淸之陶磁、非常詳明、末後討論到中華民族對於陶瓷應有的努力這問題、要挽救日前陶瓷業的頹風、第一整理全國的舊　、第二集中精神與力量、「這樣一來、則中國的陶瓷器的挽救、就是等於挽救中華民族的自己、於是中華民族的陶瓷器的創造、是有主義的創造、是民族主義的陶瓷的創造、中華民族的陶瓷的藝術是有主義的藝術、是民族主義的陶瓷的藝術、中華民族的陶瓷器有了民族主義和民族主義的藝術爲中心的原動力量、則一定可以在最近的將來能夠恢復陶瓷器的光榮史、不僅能夠恢復、而且可以創造的、這一種重大的使命、應該由中華民族自己起來負擔的、」</p>
<p>「變動」是一篇李贊華的站在　　主</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>義文藝的立塲上的創作、故事的頂點是寫一個村莊所遭遇的共匪的恐怖、婦孺老幼逃難於號哭聲中、本來很安靜的各幹着事業、却竟發生了殺人放大毫不憐憫的大刦難、使無辜的村民嘗到、「夜是這樣的黑暗、山路是這樣的崎嶇、到即裏去呢、一行列的人呆住了、」的痛苦、這算是什麽一種幸福呢、作者把筆着重於臘梅阿娘和臘阿娘欄裏的猪、臘梅阿娘所日夜關心的猪、身上、想到這是一筆過年的費用、早安排好的、可是竟因逃難而捨離了、而且當回顧自己的家、巳爲血紅的火光所包圍、這種本能的悲傷、該是怎樣、於是由臘梅阿娘的反映、便充分地表現一種深刻的意識之潛在了、在枝巧方面、這篇創作確是很顧到的、很自然、並沒有絲毫做作、而且那農民生活的狀况、描寫得麽有力、至於結構的嚴緊誠難找出鬆懈的地方、在民族主義文藝的創作上、這篇「變動」可說是有力的表現了、</p>
<p>「守夜人」是亞美利亞阿哈龍尼安的原著、據作者的介紹、阿哈龍尼安是二十世紀的最著名的亞美尼亞小說家丨也是爲民族求自由求安全的不倦的戰士、我們在這篇中可找出阿哈龍尼安的沉鬱激昻的風格、他的内在的意識將賜予讀者以怎樣的感動、守夜人是一個反命運者、對於命運絶對不承認、如果人類是有了命運這東西、那無異說、人類是沒有奮鬥意老的、但他怎樣有這獨特的意識呢、那他有着他的故事丨他告訴了在咖啡店裏的人了、那是他自己同命運奮鬥過來、而巳克服命運戰勝命運、他在暴力者丨敵人丨的手裏、因强烈的反命運的感覺、竟反把暴力者致於死亡、他當時有了這樣的覺悟、他看見鶴起初喙了蛇、後來竟反爲蛇所盤繞死的一回事、但也許作者所設的譬方吧、「蛇和鸛的鬥爭也在我心裏起了一種改變、我從來沒有聽人說過一條蛇能夠扼死一隻鸛、鸛本來是蛇爲死敵、是蛇底命運之神底化身、然而、在今天、它的命運之神却怎麽令不能夠制了它呢、難這上帝連一條毒蛇他都不許它成鸛底、不公平的肉食的、含許我們的命運被這個克爾特人解决了麽、不我對自己說、我以前的念頭是錯了、一個人必須要努力尋一條出路、」後來、他把他自己的故事說完了、使全房間的人都不禁波動「在許多在家中的聲音裏、人們聽到了爲自由而奮鬥的呼聲、」全篇很緊張、我們可以說是一篇成功的短篇小說、</p>
<p>「北京的末日」是法國羅蒂的原著、寫八國聯軍的悲劇、使我讀了委實驚心動魄、想到我們民族之被異民族蹂躪、而且種種侮篾、能不憤慨、而反省、冀挽救了我們民族的危機、同時在一般文藝作家、似乎也該認識、像這樣的材料、我們自己未有利用、而外人却巳先我們利用了、不羞慚嗎、唉、北京的未日、恐也是象徵中國的未日吧、本篇本期尙未載完、</p>
<p>綜觀這期的「前鋒月刋、」我們是可以認爲是充實的、不過决不要因此至懈怠起來呵、仍須遵着前進的「號聲」積極往前衝呢、我的介紹想到此截止、至於尙有很多精髓的地方、請讀者再自己去分析着吧、</p>
<h3>滿蒙問題</h3>
<p>— 南心</p>
<p>華企雲編</p>
<p>滿蒙在我們中國佔有重要的位置、它雖然處於邊陲、但是關於實業者則至深且鉅、然而此點、反被外人所重視、即如日本人之對於我國滿蒙、祗要這方面偶有一新的問題發生、其報紙上必大書特書、加倍宣傳、是企冀全國人士引起分外的注意、而激發他們研究的興趣、使一般閲者能與報紙同起一種重視的作用於是、爲這滿蒙問題而有萸集史乘以考察它底由來的、有作爲文字以批評它底現狀的、有設爲懸揣而推測它底將來的、不久、關於這類新的問題文字、便遍傳於全國了、這是就其一般的人士而言、至於其政府方面、則有每年派遣專員實地前往滿蒙考察實業的、有調查富源的、在其所派遣的人數、實不下數十百人之夥、由此、足見他們之注意於滿蒙却膀於我國人士、但是關於滿蒙一類的書籍、在日本更可算是汪牛充棟、在我們中國眞個是寥若晨星、不爲人們所重視、那麽、華君最近編著此書的出版、實具有相當的意義與價値、</p>

<p>滿蒙之經濟、係綜合述之、一、滿蒙之農業、甲、滿蒙之耕地及農產、乙、大豆高梁穀子粟麥及雜穀、丙、棉花烟葉甜菜及花生、丁、果櫉、戊、柞蠶業、二、滿蒙之礦業、甲、滿蒙礦產之豐富、乙、煤礦、丙、鐵礦、丁、金礦、戊、其它礦物、三、滿蒙之林業、四、滿蒙之牧畜業、五、滿蒙之水產業、六、滿蒙之貨幣、七、滿蒙之交通、八、滿蒙之貿易、作者在每一節中、均有說明及圖表、分條不紊、實爲述其經濟範圍最完備之一章、</p>
<p>滿蒙之外交、計分爲上、中、下三篇、上篇爲中俄與滿蒙、一、自俄國之東侵以至中日之戰、二、中日之戰以至俄國革命、三、自俄國革命以至俄協定之成立、四、自中俄協定成立以至現在、中篇爲中日與滿蒙、一自中日之戰以至歐戰勃發、二、自對德宣戰以至日本田中内閣之成立、三、自日本田中内閣成立以至現在、下篇爲列强與滿蒙、此篇較前兩篇更爲重要、使我們讀之、可以明白今日滿蒙危迫情形之所以來由、能引起國人的惕厲、而共同謀挽回這頹局的策略、同時、此三國所有的連帶關係的、亦可一目瞭然、附錄四篇、尤足參考、</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Breaking Through the Economic Crisis</h3>
<p>Today, various powerful nations are seeking ways to break through the economic crisis. The purpose is none other than to expand overseas markets, allowing stagnant commerce to develop outwards, and the purpose of this outward development is none other than the Far East's China. However, under the current circumstances of poverty and depleted wealth, China's purchasing power is already very weak. If various powerful nations all aim for trade with China, gathering their goods in China's market to compete and absorb the Chinese people's wealth, then China's market will collapse. If China's market collapses, Chinese merchants will not be able to stand their ground, and what benefit will foreign merchants have? Therefore, today, for the sake of foreign merchants, they cannot only seek to save their own country's difficulties, only know how to seek one-sided benefits, but should seek ways to benefit both sides, to overcome this economic crisis together. It must be understood that the Chinese market primarily relies on Chinese commerce, and the rise and fall of the Chinese economy. If foreign merchants wish to develop in China, they must first understand that there is a necessity for co-existence and co-prosperity with Chinese commerce. They should first study methods of mutual support and connection from the perspective of mutual interests, giving Chinese merchants the opportunity to develop together, and then the market can develop alongside them. If foreign merchants only seek the development of their own country's trade and do not help to facilitate Chinese merchants, or even worse, not only do they not help to facilitate but also use various means to oppress and hinder them, then Chinese merchants will inevitably be unable to compete with them and will collapse. Foreign merchants with long sleeves and good dancing will also be unable to survive alone in the Chinese market. Therefore, the so-called economic crisis of today is a crisis shared by all nations. To break through this crisis, there is only one method: cooperation. If one country seeks to escape this crisis without caring that the difficulties of other countries are deepening, this is certainly not the right method. I humbly hope that those who speak of breaking through the crisis will pay attention to this.</p>

<h3>Strong Aftershocks Continue in the Mishima Region of Japan</h3>
<p>Those Who Survived the Disaster Feel Even More Anxious</p>
<p>Bitter Cold Winds and Rain Increase the Desolation</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th, Dentsu Dispatch: According to observations from the Mishima Branch of the Central Meteorological Observatory, since the strong earthquake yesterday morning, there have been a total of 850 aftershocks that can be felt by the human body up to this morning, including 15 strong earthquakes and 2 weak earthquakes.</p>
<p>Mishima, 27th, Dentsu Dispatch: The disaster victims in the Izu and Suruga regions are threatened by aftershocks. They spent the night in the suburbs amidst cold winds and heavy rain. The soldiers and firefighters on alert did not close their eyes all night, their hands and feet were swollen from frostbite, and they were extremely exhausted. There were strong aftershocks at 6 PM and 10 PM on the 26th. The disaster victims dared not enter their houses this morning and are still cooking outdoors. The cries of women and children shake the earth. The misery of the damage is beyond imagination. Reuters, Tokyo, 27th: The areas affected by this earthquake are all agricultural regions, so the impact on industry and commerce is minimal. As for the losses, apart from private property and road traffic, the most significant are the Shimizu Port and the Tanna Tunnel. The new project for Shimizu Port will cost 1 million Japanese yen. The construction of the Tanna Tunnel has been underway for several years and connects Atami and Numazu. It will cost 20 million Japanese yen. According to experts, this earthquake was partly due to the Tanna Tunnel project, as the epicenter seems to be near that location. This project has encountered great difficulties from the beginning. Workers are often troubled by hot springs and constantly feel the ground shaking. Therefore, many believe that the intensity of this earthquake may be due to the tunnel project.</p>
<p>The Cause of the Violent Earthquake</p>
<p>Technician Kunitomi Issues Statement</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo: Regarding the cause of yesterday's major earthquake in the Izu and Suruga regions, Central Meteorological Observatory technician Kunitomi officially stated: "The area of violent tremors extends from the southern end of Mount Hakone, through the Tanna Basin, to the area along the fault line of Ukihashi Town. The cause is the activity of the large Tanna Fault, which has experienced frequent small earthquakes since the beginning of this month. In the future, there may still be considerable larger aftershocks." Survey of Damage</p>
<p>Hot Springs Completely Destroyed, Kano River Embankment Breached</p>
<p>Nichi-Ren, Tokyo: According to the confirmed damage announced by the Shizuoka Police Department at noon today, the figures are as follows: 255 dead, 345 injured, 22,658 houses completely destroyed, and 5,562 houses partially destroyed. Nichi-Ren, Tokyo: The extent of the damage in the epicenter of this earthquake has gradually become clear this morning. Within the line of Yugawara, Hakone, Mishima, and Ito, the areas of strong earthquakes are Susono, Nikkozan, Nakazato Village, Nagaoka, Ohito, Ukihashi, Tsunahika, and Atami. The Niyama area is particularly severe. The loss of life in this earthquake is relatively small because the epicenter is in the most sparsely populated Okuizu. Dentsu Dispatch: The most tragic aspect of yesterday morning's Izu and Suruga earthquake was the hot spring town of Hakone on the shores of Lake Ashi. Of the 96 households in the entire town, 71 households, including the Hakone Ryokan, were completely destroyed, and the rest were partially destroyed. The original form of the town no longer exists, creating an extremely desolate and tragic scene. During the earthquake, Lake Ashi, which was usually as smooth as a mirror, also experienced raging waves that surged onto the shore. Furthermore, the Nagaoka Onsen and Kona Onsen were completely destroyed. Hot spring guests wandered around in confusion, lost their way, and were scalded by hot springs that were erupting everywhere, making them unapproachable. As a result, many were injured. Even more tragic was that the embankment of the Kano River collapsed during the earthquake, and 30 households were washed away in Naka-Kano Village, drowning 15 villagers. The village has become a swamp. Inspection of the Disaster Area</p>
<p>Ground Cracked, Roof Tiles Gone</p>
<p>Dentsu, Mishima, 26th: This reporter (i.e., a Dentsu reporter) who was specially dispatched to inspect the actual situation of the major earthquake in the Izu area, entered the earthquake zone from Numazu. Upon arriving in Numazu, all that could be seen were chimneys bent into curved shapes, and not a single roof tile remained. It was reminiscent of the Kanto earthquake in previous years. When disembarking in Numazu, the passengers all intended to go to Mishima via the Sunto Railway, but the rails were curved and the ground cracked, so it was impossible to drive the train. Therefore, they advanced through rice paddies with no roads to travel on. Because the winding roads were also blocked by cracks or collapsed buildings, it was impossible to pass. Upon reaching Mishima, the situation was even more tragic. Especially in the Futukamachi area, there was not a single completely intact house. The town was littered with fallen boxes and baskets, with hardly any place to set foot. All that could be seen were soldiers and firefighters demolishing collapsed houses and rescuing survivors who were trapped under roofs or telephone poles. At one point, the body of a woman was excavated from a collapsed house, and I averted my eyes as I passed. Arriving at Mishima Myojin, there were over 500 disaster victims receiving surgery for their injuries. There, I asked the authorities about the actual situation of the damage. Then I went near Niyama. The cracks along the way were like huge snakes lying on the ground. The area of devastation started at the northern end of Mishima and extended 7 or 8 li along the Shonan area. The most tragic was Niyama, with 69 deaths, and the area 2 li south of Mishima. In Minami-Jo, all 53 households collapsed, and 19 people died. The Shimoda Highway was sunken in many places, and the mulberry fields on both sides were also cracked and incomplete. When I traveled on the Shimoda Highway, I saw the bodies of fathers and sons crushed to death, and the corpses of families who had died tragically, everywhere. There were also the bodies of mothers and children lying on top of doors. Then I changed direction and went to Nagaoka. Houses collapsed along the way, and it was impossible to proceed. I only saw disaster victims going back and forth, and the rescue work of soldiers and youth groups was very busy and chaotic. Upon reaching Kona Onsen, all the houses had collapsed, and hot springs were gushing out from the edge of the cliff, with extremely high temperatures. Moving further ahead to Nagaoka, the Chitose Bridge had fallen, making it impossible to cross. So I took off my clothes and went barefoot, wading through the water. All I saw were fallen roofs, not a single complete house. The only building that hadn't collapsed was the Suruga Bank branch. Due to the earthquake, the hot springs were gushing out in an unprecedented manner, and hot water was overflowing onto the ground.</p>
<p>Nichi-Ren Dispatch: The Central Meteorological Observatory announced the results of its inspection of the Izu earthquake area as follows: "This earthquake was centered on Tanna and extended from Moto-Hakone in the north to Ukihashi in the south. About 26 faults have been discovered. The extension line of the fault is currently under investigation." According to the latest report, there are large cracks of about 15 cho in the Tanna Basin. In Niyama, there is a sunken area every 30 ken, for a total of 4 places. Among them are large stones that have fallen, and landslides are everywhere. The Tagata District, near the epicenter, has suffered extremely severe damage. Houses have collapsed, and roads and fields are cracked.</p>
<p>Aerial View by Airplane</p>
<p>Hakone and Ito Suffered the Most Damage</p>
<p>Nichi-Ren Dispatch, Tokyo: According to reports from Japanese Airlines airplanes that flew to the Izu area yesterday to inspect the situation, 100,000 tsubo of land between Mount Kurakake in Hakone and Tanna has completely sunk.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo: Due to the destruction of transportation facilities, the damage in many places is still unclear. Among them, the disaster situation in the Hakone area is even more severe. Captain Ogawa, who inspected the disaster area from the air on an airplane today, told people that it is only possible to walk from Yamanaka-Shinden to Hakone. Transportation between Lake Ashi, Hakone, and Miyanoshita-Yumoto is cut off. Two-thirds of the houses in the entire village of Hakone have collapsed. The Hakone Hotel, which is a landmark from the air, has also been completely destroyed. The devastation along the coastline from Shonan to Atami, centered on Izu, is more tragic than the earthquake in Tokyo. The embers have not yet died out in the two locations of Matsuzaki on the west coast and Matsubara on the east coast. There is also a hazy smoke in Ito Town, obscuring the air above 300 meters. There are many sunken places between Shimoda and Shuzenji. The reservoir in the mountains of Shuzenji collapsed, causing flooding, and the hot springs are gone. Not a single school in Shimoda remains. Smoke is still rising from the collapsed houses in the market of Oba.</p>
<p>Post-Earthquake Measures</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo: The Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance held an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon. Because the damage from this earthquake is very great, it was decided to exempt taxes and postpone tax collection as follows: (1) This year's land rent, business profit tax, income tax, and Class B income tax, which are due for tax exemption after the earthquake, will all be exempted. (2) The collection of various taxes due before the earthquake will be postponed. (3) The four types of taxes mentioned above will be reduced from the next year onwards, surtaxes will be exempted, and other special measures will be taken.</p>
<p>Nichi-Ren, Tokyo: The Ministry of Home Affairs will decide on post-earthquake measures once the reports from the authorities of the affected prefectures of Shizuoka and Kanagawa and the special envoys arrive. The prefectural authorities will do their utmost to fully implement emergency measures such as general relief and medical treatment. If the prefectural authorities are unable to implement them, the Ministry of Home Affairs will provide direct assistance. Civil engineering work in the affected areas will be planned and restored by the prefectures, cities, and villages. The expenses will be paid by the national treasury, with an amount of approximately 4 million yen.</p>
<p>Nichi-Ren, Tokyo: The Ministry of Railways has decided to transport all kinds of relief supplies to the earthquake areas in Izu free of charge, for a period of one month from the 26th. Building materials will be reduced by 50%, for a period of two months.</p>
<h3>Continued Trial of the Soviet Anti-Revolutionary Case</h3>
<p>Confession Reveals Anglo-French Conspiracy</p>
<p>French Declaration Denies</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 27th: The anti-revolutionary conspiracy case continued its trial yesterday. The confession of the first defendant, Rakovsky, has now been printed into a booklet and sold to the public. Sales are excellent, and a second edition of 500,000 copies is being printed. Rakovsky read his confession, which lasted seven hours. He detailed the work he had done in the conspiracy to undermine the Soviet Russian Five-Year Plan for industrialization and to incite foreign armed intervention. The confession implicates prominent French figures such as Poincaré and French Foreign Minister Briand, former British Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer Churchill, and British oil magnate Deterding. According to the official communications agency, defendant Professor Larychev admitted during the trial that all the points mentioned in Rakovsky's confession were true. He also mentioned the plan to seize the Baku and Grozny oil regions, saying that the Nobel family directed this work through the agency of the Englishman Deterding.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 27th: Poincaré and Briand have both issued statements denying all the points confessed by Rakovsky.</p>
<p>Reuters, Riga, 27th: The Soviet authorities are now organizing large-scale public demonstrations to oppose those accused in the conspiracy case. They are also organizing marches in major Russian cities and having representatives of various groups express to the judges the public's desire for the accused to be sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th: During questioning in the House of Commons today, MPs Lord and Knox said that during the Moscow anti-revolutionary conspiracy trial, there were remarks opposing Britain. They asked whether the government would, like France, formally protest to Russia. Foreign Secretary Henderson replied that the documents disclosed by the Russian newspapers contained private confessions with baseless slanders against the British people and the British government, mostly concerning matters in 1927 and 1928. As for the abstract signed by the prosecutor, it contained implications of another foreign country, but did not mention the British government or the British people, so there was no reason to protest. Knox said that the Russian newspaper Pravda had indeed recently made records involving the British government. The Foreign Secretary replied that he had not seen this newspaper. If he could be shown it, he could consider it.</p>

<p>Foreign Urgent Dispatches Two</p>
<h3>Turkish Foreign Minister Arrives in Milan</h3>
<p>Following the Russian Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Consulting on Important Issues</p>
<p>Komintern, Rome, 26th: Turkish Foreign Minister Shtet arrived in Milan from Geneva today. He will go to Rome to meet with the Italian Prime Minister and the Italian Foreign Minister to discuss important international issues. This visit by the Turkish Foreign Minister comes after the meeting of diplomats from Italy and Russia in Milan, so it has attracted much attention from the outside world. It is generally expected that the talks between the Italian Foreign Minister and the Soviet People's Commissar will not focus solely on economic issues, as the trade agreement between the two countries has just been concluded and is operating smoothly. There is currently no major issue that requires the diplomatic authorities of the two countries to travel far to Milan to meet. Economic issues will of course be discussed, such as Italy agreeing to build merchant ships, submarines, and light cruisers for Russia, with part of the payment to be made by the Russians in grain and goods. This is one example. However, it is expected that such issues will only account for a small part of the discussion. With the arrival of the Turkish Foreign Minister, it is even more certain that there will be other important discussions on the issues of the three countries.</p>
<h3>Revolution Breaks Out Again in Peru</h3>
<p>Associated Press, New York, 27th: It is reported that a fierce battle, a precursor to revolution, has broken out in Lima. However, due to the strict censorship of news throughout Peru, the truth is still difficult to ascertain.</p>

If 4.5 billion francs are withdrawn to meet the needs of economic reform, it will have no impact on domestic finance.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Inquires About Chinese Affairs</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th: Today, Foreign Secretary Henderson replied in the House of Commons to questions about extraterritoriality in China. He said that when Chinese Foreign Minister Wang spoke with British Minister Lampson on November 20, he made some criticisms of the British draft. An answer is expected soon. He knew of the unrest in China, but said that stopping negotiations would not be beneficial. Labour MP Day asked whether replies had been received from the major powers concerned. Henderson replied that this question required a more cautious answer. The Foreign Secretary also replied to a question from an MP, saying that when the British Minister discussed the matter with the Chinese government in Nanjing, he made detailed inquiries about the consideration of British creditors' rights. The British Minister stated that any solution proposed by the Chinese government must have provisions for the prompt and full repayment of valid debts to British people.</p>
<h3>Italian Missionary Murdered in China, Italian Government Protests</h3>

<h3>Tense Situation in Spain</h3>
<p>Komintern, Madrid, 26th: After the escape of Spanish aviator Lieutenant Franco from prison, two of his close friends were arrested today and charged with aiding his escape. Security is very tight in the capital. Large teams of security guards and police patrol the streets at night, and machine guns have been installed at various strategic points. As a result, rumors are rampant, and the situation has become tense again. A bloody tragedy occurred in the Tarifa area outside the capital. Police opened fire on protesting civilians, killing three and seriously injuring more than 20. However, this action was of an economic nature.</p>
<h3>Preparatory Committee for Disarmament Approves Clauses of the Disarmament Draft Treaty</h3>

<p>Reuters, Geneva, 26th: The Disarmament Committee today approved a clause in the 1927 Draft Treaty, providing for the establishment of a permanent Disarmament Committee in Geneva to monitor the implementation of this convention.

<h3>Tariff Truce Conference Ends</h3>
<p>Deadline for Ratification of the Convention Extended</p>
<p>Komintern, Geneva, 26th: The Second International Economic Conference (i.e., the Tariff Truce Conference) ended today. Due to the fact that only eight countries, including Britain, have ratified the convention on extending the validity of trade agreements, it was decided to extend the deadline to January 25 next year. After the deadline has passed, a third economic conference will be convened as soon as possible to discuss the implementation of the convention.</p>
<h3>Old American Aircraft Sold to Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 26th: US Assistant Secretary of War Davison said today that it has recently been reported that many American-made aircraft, all equipped with Liberty engines, are being transported to Soviet Russia. There is some truth to this statement, as the US military recently sold many outdated aircraft to private individuals. The aircraft transported to Russia may be this batch. The engines of these aircraft are all old and have no military use other than for training. The acquisition of these aircraft by Soviet Russia has no military value to speak of. According to the deputy manager of the Soviet Russian-American Trading Corporation, Amito, who testified before the House of Representatives Finance Committee today, the United States did indeed sell many aircraft to the Soviet Russian government through illegal means.</p>
<h3>Poland Mistreating Ethnic Minorities</h3>

<h3>Yan Xishan Will Definitely Come to Japan</h3>
<p>Ma Boyuan Comes to Japan to Prepare Dormitory for Yan</p>
<p>400,000 Yuan Remitted to the American Bank in Kobe</p>
<p>Osaka Correspondence: Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang, having no foothold in the country, have decided, after consultation, to flee to Japan in the near future. They first sent Ma Boyuan and Ke Yi to Japan to prepare everything. The two arrived in Japan on the 19th of this month aboard the merchant ship Chang'an Maru from Tianjin, and arrived in Moji on the morning of the 23rd. They went to Kobe and then took a ship directly to Tokyo. They rented the villa of Mr. Yamamoto in Daita, outside Osaka, as a dormitory for Yan. As for Yan's travel expenses, 400,000 yuan in Chinese currency has been remitted from Tianjin to the Kobe branch of the American New York Bank. After arriving in Tokyo, Ma Boyuan, residing in Kami-Ochiai, made the following statement to reporters: "Feng Yuxiang will take his chief of staff, Liu Qi, from Jinci to Gansu for a while, with only a dozen subordinates. He says that he will no longer engage in political activities, but will only study calligraphy and tour scenic spots, and then decide on his next move. Since it is difficult to maintain Yan and Feng after their failure, both military and political affairs have been handed over to their subordinates to be dealt with by the central government. The rumor that Feng will go to Russia is not true. Feng may also flee to Japan in the future. He is currently learning Japanese and will be able to understand ordinary conversation after six months. After arriving in Japan, he will focus on the study of labor and social issues. Feng's wife, Li Dequan, has arrived in Tianjin and is ready to leave. Her residence has been rented in Kura, on the outskirts of Tokyo. Yan's residence is in Daita, along the Hanshin line. In the future, Feng may be able to live with Yan there, but they cannot come to Japan at the same time. Yan will be accompanied by Zhao Daiwen and Zhao Pilian, and Feng will be accompanied by Liu Qi. Wang Zhaoming is still hiding in Tianjin. It is not certain whether he will come to Japan with Yan and Feng." (November 24)</p>
<h3>Third Phase of Bandit Suppression Conference in Ji'an</h3>

<p>Chiang and Cai's Divisions Advance South Along the Hunan-Jiangxi Border</p>
<p>The Provincial Government Actively Provides Relief to Ji'an Counties</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Lu Diping, the commander-in-chief of the Ninth Route Army, led the Ninth Route Army headquarters and the 15th and 2nd Aviation Squadrons to Ji'an on the 20th of this month, and immediately ordered the Zhang, Tan, Xu, Gong, and Luo divisions to clear the remaining bandits and communists in the newly recovered 13 counties including Ji'an and Yongfeng, and to handle local rehabilitation. On the one hand, he plans to advance and suppress the remaining bandits in Nanfeng, Ningdu, and Taihe, so as to eradicate the roots. According to a telegram from Ji'an, Lu's original plan to meet in Ji'an has been completed. In the future, the encirclement and suppression policy urgently needs to be planned in a comprehensive manner in order to achieve the effect of complete annihilation. Therefore, on the morning of the 24th, he convened a military conference at the Ji'an headquarters. The attendees were division commanders Luo Lin, Gong Bingfan, Zhang Huizan, Tan Daoyuan, Xu Kexiang, and brigade commander Liu Yi, etc. After the division commanders reported on the course of the battle and the current situation of the bandits and communists, various proposals were discussed in detail. As a result, the third phase of the suppression plan was decided, which was immediately submitted to Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Director He for review. Once approved, the entire army will be mobilized again to carry out the planned joint suppression.</p>
<p>According to intelligence reports from various sources, the Fourth and Twelfth Armies of Zhu De's pseudo-First Army Corps are in the Nanfeng and Lichuan area, the Fifth and Eighth Armies of Peng Dehuai's pseudo-Second Army Corps are fleeing to Ningdu and Xingguo, Mao Zedong's pseudo-Twentieth Army is escaping to Wan'an and Taihe, and Huang Gonglue, Chen Yi, and others' pseudo-Twenty-Second Army are not far from the Anfu area. Because Chiang Kuang-nai and Cai Tingkai's two divisions are still stationed in Pingxiang, these bandits do not dare to flee back to Jinggang on the Hunan-Jiangxi border, and mostly move towards the Min-Guang border in southeastern Jiangxi. Huang and Mao's bandits have a tendency to invade Ganzhou from Taihe. Zhu's bandits want to escape to Tingzhou and Hangchuan in Fujian again, so Ganzhou is now in great danger. The Ganzhou County Party Department and Public Security Corps have repeatedly telegraphed for help. As for the suppression troops, the Gong, Luo, Xu, Deng, Zhang, Tan, and other divisions are all searching for the remaining bandits in various counties, attacking the bandit dens in Donggu and Nanbo, and arranging deployments. Mao Bingwen's division is actively departing for Fuzhou to take on the task of blocking the Fujian border. The Xiang brigade of that division has all arrived in Fuzhou. Cai and Jiang's two divisions will advance south from Pingxiang along the Hunan-Jiangxi border through Lianhua, Yongxin, Suichuan, and Chongyi to coordinate with the Guangxi-Guangdong border to protect Ganzhou. The third general offensive order will be issued only after Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek arrives in Jiangxi. In addition, Fang Zhimin in eastern Jiangxi has been harassing more than 20 counties in the Yi, De, Rao, and Xin regions. Lu has requested Chiang and He to designate the area east of the Nanxun Railway and north of the Guangxin River (the northeastern Jiangxi region, including Shangrao, Raozhou, Jingzhen, Pengze, Hukou, Duchang, Yongxiu) to be the responsibility of the Ruan Zhaochang of the 55th Division of Anhui and the Hu Zuyu brigade of Jiujiang. Hu's troops are moving from south to west, and Ruan's troops are moving from north to south, currently carrying out a joint suppression. Jingzhen will soon be recovered.</p>
<p>At this time when the large army is progressing in the bandit suppression, local rehabilitation is very important. The provincial government has approved the rehabilitation measures for the bandit areas drafted by the Civil Affairs Department, such as gathering refugees, and is implementing them separately. Yesterday's provincial affairs conference decided to recommend Education Director Jiang Ji to tour northeastern Jiangxi and Civil Affairs Director Wang Yinxi to tour southwestern Jiangxi to inspect the disaster situation, comfort the refugees, and handle rehabilitation. Wang departed from the province yesterday for Ji'an. However, the recently recovered counties of Ji'an and Jishui have been emptied by the bandits, leaving only empty cities. Oil, salt, firewood, and rice are all gone. The army has no supplies, and the people are about to starve to death. Commander-in-Chief Lu first restored traffic on the Gan River from the province to Ji'an, and then telegraphed Finance Director Chen Jiadong and Deputy Quartermaster Cao to quickly order the provincial merchants to purchase large quantities of oil, salt, firewood, and rice and transport them to Ji'an for emergency relief. According to the report from the Security Office to Lu, 600 salt permits have been dispatched, and oil is also being purchased. Rice is being purchased from Xiajiang and other areas. Tens of thousands of silver dollars are being shipped from the province and will arrive in Ji'an soon. (November 25)</p>
<h3>The Fujian Students Association in Beijing Asks Zhu Shaoliang to Simultaneously Suppress Bandits in Fujian</h3>
<p>The Suffering in Fujian is No Less Than in Jiangxi, Please Take Care of Both</p>
<p>The Fujian Students Association in Beijing specially sent Zhang Duo, Wang Xiunan, Lin Hao, and Wu Zizhong to meet with Zhu Shaoliang, the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in Fujian and Jiangxi, at the Central Hotel. Zhu personally received them. The representatives successively described the youth of various schools in Beijing representing Fujian, welcoming Commander-in-Chief Zhu to enter Fujian, thoroughly punish Lu, and suppress the bandits and communists. However, it was recently heard that the central government is focusing on the Jiangxi side, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu will soon go to Jiangxi. It has not yet been decided whether to enter Fujian. However, the suffering of the bandits and communists in Fujian is deep and the people are in dire straits, eagerly awaiting rescue and suffering greatly, no less than in Jiangxi. Only because Fujian Province is farther from Beijing, there are very few newspaper reports, and the truth of the disaster is not known to the outside world. They earnestly requested the commander-in-chief to comprehensively plan and take care of both the bandit suppression in Jiangxi and Fujian, so as to suppress the bandits and communists in Fujian in the shortest possible time, restore order, and start political construction. Zhu replied that the central government is planning for the political and military affairs of Fujian Province, and there will be a solution in the near future. Jiangxi and Fujian must be given equal importance. The central government shares the hope of everyone. There must be a plan for priority and urgency, and your wishes will be achieved soon. I will follow the central government's intentions and carry out the suppression of bandits and communists in Jiangxi and Fujian. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>

<h3>The Recovery of Taihu County, Anhui Province</h3>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Taihu County, Anhui Province, was previously captured by bandits and communists but was soon recovered by the troops of Yan Heling, commander of the 339th Regiment of the 57th Division. Yue Shengxuan, commander of the 57th Division, telegraphed the provincial government yesterday, reporting the recovery process, stating, "I have just received a telegram from Liang, Brigade Commander of my division, relaying a report from Yan Heling, Commander of the 339th Regiment. The report states that I led my troops to advance from Susong to Taihu. At 9 a.m., we arrived at Liangting River and discovered that there were about 2,000 bandits and communists who had captured Taihu at 4 p.m. on the [missing character] day and refused to leave. I then led my troops to continue to advance rapidly. At 11 a.m., we arrived at Maoerling and received a report that the bandits and communists, upon hearing of our army's arrival, were exiting the north gate and fleeing towards Yingshan. At that time, in addition to sending a unit to attack the county via Xiaxia Pass, I led the main force across the mountains via Xiaxia Pass and Jingjie Ridge, bypassing to Lidudian, 20 li northwest of Taihu, to intercept them. We arrived at 8 p.m., but the bandits had already fled. Due to the darkness, it was not convenient to pursue them. I led my troops back to Taihu County to maintain order, etc. In addition to having telegraphed the regiment to remain temporarily in Taihu pending the arrival of Cai's brigade, I respectfully submit this telegram for your information. Yue Shengxuan, Commander of the 57th Division, Hao Wu Can Yin [time notation]." (November 24th)</p>
<h3>Transportation in Shandong Province After the War</h3>
<p>Actively Restoring Long-Distance Buses and Telephones</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Before the major war this year, Shandong's construction endeavors, such as long-distance buses, were already taking shape. Unfortunately, after the war, all buses were taken away by the military, and the roads were severely damaged. Zhang Honglie, the director of the Construction Department, is actively preparing to restore them. However, although the budget for construction expenses and regular expenses in the 19th fiscal year lists 5,209,600 yuan, the provincial government's finances are difficult, and it can only issue administrative expenses monthly. Business expenses cannot be allocated according to the budget, causing great difficulties for construction projects. Therefore, they have no choice but to start with road administration, requesting and receiving approval from the provincial government to order 25 buses from Shanghai的和記 Company. Once they arrive in early December, they can be distributed to various routes. Currently, the Li-He (Lijin to Heze), De-Lin (Dezhou to Linqing), and Cao-Ji (Caoxian to Jining) routes can still operate. The Dong-Wu (Dongchang to Wuding) route can only be opened after repairs. The Yan-Wei bus route has the largest scale and has not been affected by military activities. However, in fact, this route is controlled by the Yantai area. The remaining routes, such as Jiao-Sha (Jiaozhou to Shazikou) and Ji-Qi (Jinan to Jidong), are all commercially operated. An-Wei (Anqiu to Weixian) is also commercially operated. The province's long-distance telephone system is easier to build because of existing old materials. Eight counties, including Heze, Jiaxiang, Yuncheng, Shanxian, Chengwu, Jinxiang, Juye, and Jining, have been able to make calls and send and receive commercial telegrams since the 15th of this month. The call fee is 2 jiao per 100 li per 5 minutes. The telephone line from Changqing to Feicheng is also about to be completed. Currently, the line from Jinan to Zhangqiu is being installed, and it can be extended to various counties in Jiaodong in the future. As for the Xiaqing River, the only waterway in the province, the Construction Department is also planning to dredge it to allow small steamers to pass. Due to financial difficulties, it is proposed to ask Chairman Han to allocate the Third Route Engineering Corps to assist in order to expedite the process. (November 26th)</p>
<h3>Chen Jitang's Winter Defense Conference After Returning to Guangdong</h3>
<p>Six Concrete Measures for Winter Defense Decided</p>
<p>The city is divided and assigned to military police and police</p>
<p>Scheduled to be implemented on December 15th</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Winter defense is approaching, and the provincial and municipal authorities are paying close attention to this issue. Chen Jitang, commander-in-chief of the Eighth Route Army, returned to Guangdong this time not only to discuss Zhang Gui's surrender but also to arrange winter defense matters in the province. On the evening of the 20th of this month, Chen convened a winter defense conference at the headquarters to discuss winter defense arrangements. In Guangzhou, the execution is entrusted to the military police and the Public Security Bureau, while in other areas, it is jointly responsible by the defense army county soldiers, and local militias. The navy will send fleets to patrol each river section for defense. The suburbs of Guangzhou City will be defended by He Fangbin's troops of the 126th Brigade. After receiving the order, He's troops have been preparing for days to move the entire four battalions to Xiaogang, Sanyuanli, Tangxi, Tangxia, Tangyong, and other places north of the city, selecting sites for stationing. The military police headquarters has formed a special patrol team, dividing the urban area into segments for patrols day and night. The Public Security Bureau also drafted six winter defense measures on the 19th and distributed them to each Public Security Bureau branch for implementation. The specific measures are: (1) Order the Detective Section to select capable detectives to be stationed in each branch to assist in investigating petty thieves on a regular basis, with two assigned to each bureau. (2) Order each branch to suspend police drills during the winter defense period to focus on duty. (3) Issue a notice to increase the number of off-duty police officers to organize armed police patrol teams, all equipped with rifles, ready to patrol the streets at any time. (4) Resume inspection of gun permits. Each branch will set its own time to send police teams to important locations on each street to check pedestrians and vehicles to prevent petty thieves from mingling. (5) Search suspicious households. For mixed-residence areas and suspicious households where many strangers enter and exit within each branch's jurisdiction, the police should be sent to search at any time. If it is found that the population does not match the household registration, they should be detained for questioning. (6) Order the Haizhu, Nantoutou, and Etan branches to carefully inspect boats anchored in the provincial river and prohibit sand boats from lodging guests. After the above measures are implemented, the security of the suburbs will be jointly defended by the bureau in conjunction with the Nanfan County guard team. The authorities have scheduled the winter defense measures to be implemented by military and police agencies starting on December 15th. (November 22nd)</p>
<h3>Through Train from Beijing to Liaoning Starts from Shenyang</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Ministry of Railways has ordered the Jinpu and Beining Railway Bureaus to be responsible for preparing for the through train from Beijing to Liaoning, which is scheduled to start operating on the 24th of this month. The two bureaus have reached a compromise and will each provide a train set. Every Monday and Thursday, trains will depart from Pukou to Shenyang. Every Monday and Friday, trains will depart from Shenyang to Pukou. There will be a total of four round trips per week. The journey time is approximately 65 hours. The first train departed from Shenyang at 0:10 a.m. today (the 24th). Before the opening of the train service, the Tianjin General Bureau of the Beining Railway assigned the train, with a total of 13 cars including the locomotive. In addition to the baggage car and guard car allocated by the HuangguTun car factory, the remaining nine cars were attached to Pan on the 22nd and 23rd. The Shenyang office was notified to prepare the vehicles by noon on the 24th. In order to facilitate the transportation of mail, the Liaoning Postal Administration also began to scan the train service times on the same day. All express mail destined for the Jinpu Line and transferred from Jinpu to other places will be transported by the Beijing-Liaoning through train, with a special mail car attached to the rear of the train. Before 10 p.m. on the 23rd, the train drove from HuangguTun to Shenyang City Station to wait for the departure time. Because it was the first train, few people knew about it, so the train was not very crowded. (November 24th)</p>
<h3>Yanbian Requests to Increase Police</h3>
<p>Korean Bandits Rampant</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Yanji Federation of Agriculture, Industry, Commerce, and Education previously sent an express mail telegram to the Northeast officials requesting more police. The telegram read as follows: "Yanbian is unfortunately on the Japanese chopping block, suffering unspeakable pain. Recently, we requested the withdrawal of the police, which was unanimously agreed upon nationwide, and the Japanese could hardly refuse. However, on the 4th, all the police were withdrawn in the middle of the night. Korean bandits took the opportunity to become rampant, disrupting the area. The hard work of Yanbian farmers over the years has been reduced to ashes. Life and property are precarious. If we do not take measures to stop them, I am afraid that not only will the border people suffer, but it will also give people an excuse [to interfere]. If you do not consider the border people to be uncivilized, I implore you to increase the police as soon as possible to suppress the chaos." At the same time, the Liaoning National Diplomacy Association also received an appeal from the Yanji agricultural, industrial, commercial, and educational groups, requesting support. In addition to sending a telegram to the Northeast Political Affairs Committee and the Jilin Provincial Government to plead for Yanji, the association's entire committee also met with Zhang Zuoxiang, chairman of Jilin Province and acting chairman of the Political Affairs Committee, to promote the implementation. The telegram stated, "We have just received a telegram from the Yanji Federation of Agriculture, Industry, Commerce, and Education stating that since the Japanese freely increased the police last month, the border people have suffered unspeakable pain. Although they have now been withdrawn, Korean bandits are rampant, killing and setting fires, disrupting the area, and the lives and property of the border people are precarious. They have no choice but to send a telegram to the Northeast officials requesting more police. We hope you will assist in implementing this. Yanji is the throat of the Northeast and an important national defense area. The mixing of Chinese and foreigners makes the situation even more complicated. If more police are not deployed, not only will the residents of the area not have security, but governance will also fall into the hands of foreigners. We implore your committee to quickly raise funds and increase the number of police by a specific date to protect the people and defend the country."</p>

Yesterday (27th), a district affairs meeting was convened to discuss the budget for this year. It was said that the estimated income from land rent seemed too large and was slightly reduced. The annual calculation book was reviewed item by item according to the vouchers. All expenses were found to be legitimate.

<p>Fellow Townsmen in Yangzhou Request the Pursuit of Former Magistrate Wen's Debt There are still many Songjiang County public funds that were owed by the former county magistrate due to unclearly handed over responsibilities, especially the 150,000 owed by Wen Shaoliang during the Luqi War in the thirteenth year, which is the largest amount. Now, An Shisui, Wang Zihou, Wang Wei, Sun Shiheng, Xu Weiji, and other fellow townsmen from Songjiang residing in Yangzhou, upon seeing the news that the Zhejiang Provincial Government was planning to re-employ him, telegraphed Beijing and the province the day before yesterday, stating, "Wen Shaoliang, the former county magistrate of Songjiang County, owed public funds and failed to hand them over. The Provincial Government's 292nd meeting has already decided to issue a warrant for his arrest to maintain official discipline and clear the backlog of cases. However, we have seen reports that Wen Shaoliang has recently been appointed as the county magistrate by the Zhejiang Provincial Government. The Zhejiang Provincial Government may not be aware of the Jiangsu Province's arrest warrant for Wen, and Wen is greedy and insatiable. The future of the party and the country is extremely worrying. We, Shisui, etc., are heartbroken and cannot remain silent. We request that you transfer the case to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and immediately remove the newly appointed County Magistrate Wen Shaoliang from office, place him under supervision, and hand him over for strict punishment. The future of the party and the country depends on this."</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Danger of Infectious Diseases in the Third Prison of Xiaoliuzhen Lane The Third Prison of Jiangsu, originally an old prison, has a fixed quota of 500 prisoners, but the number has now more than doubled, with more than 1,300 prisoners. Recently, in November, dysentery and infectious diseases were suddenly discovered among the prisoners. More than 30 people have died this month alone. Lin, President of the Higher Court, fearing the spread of infectious diseases among the prisoners, which would be uncontrollable, and concerned about the lives of the prisoners, specially appointed Jail Division Chief Yao Guozhang on the afternoon of the 26th to go to the prison to investigate the cause of the prisoners' illness and find ways to remedy it. Fortunately, when Yao went to investigate, a prisoner had just died. It was found that as many as 49 prisoners in the entire prison were suffering from this infectious disease, including five who were most in danger and likely to die. Yao immediately ordered Warden Cai to call Chinese and Western doctors to the prison for diagnosis and treatment, ordering them to find ways to isolate the patients and return to the court to report. After receiving the report, Lin was very anxious and prepared to submit a report to the Ministry of Justice, requesting the Ministry to transfer it to the court for review and approval of the method of pardoning prisoners based on the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session at the New Year's Day of the 20th year of the Republic of China in order to relieve prison overcrowding and benefit the lives of the prisoners.</p>

<p>Robbers Shot and Killed Farmers Residents of Changsha Village, Shiba Du, San Tu, Xiangshan Township, in the county, Yu [missing character]bao's house, was suddenly robbed by seven or eight robbers the day before yesterday, suffering heavy losses.

Afterwards, the victim reported the incident to the Second Resident Station of the Ninth Branch for investigation.</p>
<p>Local Ruffians Extort Villagers Chen Jinyuan, a villager from Shiqian Village, Chenmu Township, in the county, had a love affair with the widow Gu Wang. Liao Hongyi, a ruffian in the town, colluded with Town Chief Wang Songyan to extort 746 yuan from Chen and gave 150 yuan to a certain organization in the town.

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Robbery and Murder on a Boat, Shooting of a Villager:</p>
<p>At the junction of Wuxi and Changshu, near Xueyan Bridge, in the Minjiaqiao area, a villager named Gao Chanlin, over sixty years old, went to the city with a fellow villager (some say his son) the day before yesterday. They rented an open boat, intending to transport thatch to the city for sale. Yesterday, around eleven o'clock, as the boat was sailing in the Shaotangying area (about twelve or thirteen li from Xueyan Bridge), three bandits suddenly appeared on the shore. They spoke with a northern accent, wore tattered uniforms, and carried two rifles. The lead bandit ordered them to stop the boat. Chanlin was sitting at the bow, smoking a cigarette, when the bandits, without asking questions, aimed their rifles at the flickering cigarette and fired. With a loud bang, Chanlin was shot and fell, dying instantly. The bullet entered through Chanlin's eye socket and exited from the back of his head. His companion, witnessing the scene, was terrified and, fearing for his life, docked the boat. The three bandits jumped aboard, searched the boat thoroughly, and found nothing. They then robbed Chanlin's companion of fifteen silver dollars, which he had hidden, and fled. Afterwards, the local villagers reported the incident to the county, requesting an investigation. It is also reported that the Seventeenth District Office, together with the Fourteenth Branch Bureau police, have apprehended three bandits.</p>
<p>Request to Postpone the Issuance of Construction Bonds:</p>
<p>The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce believes that the Jiangsu Provincial Government's issuance of the first phase of construction bonds, totaling four million yuan, with Wuxi being allocated two hundred thousand yuan, is disproportionately high. In recent years, various industries have been repeatedly ordered to raise funds for various bonds, leaving them utterly depleted. Bonds, paid at ninety-eight percent of their face value, often only fetch fifty to sixty percent of their original value in the Shanghai market, resulting in hidden losses borne by merchants. This construction bond is specifically designated to be repaid with funds from the real estate deed tax, but this year, due to low grain prices harming farmers and reduced land sales, except in a few cities, income has greatly decreased, taxes have doubled, prices have fallen daily, and there are few transactions. Whether the deed tax will continue to be robust in the future is questionable. Furthermore, the silk market is declining, causing a sharp drop in the market, and with the year-end closing approaching, many businesses rely on relief and find it extremely difficult to meet their obligations. Yesterday, a telegram was sent to the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Provincial Government Finance Department, and Construction Department of the National Government in Nanjing, requesting them to consider the people's hardship and temporarily postpone the issuance of Jiangsu's construction bonds to ease the burden on the people.</p>
<p>Shen Changyuan Rice Shop Nearly Bankrupt:</p>
<p>The Qingyang Shen Changyuan Rice Shop in Jiangyin County, which has been established for many years and has an excellent reputation, is in danger of bankruptcy. The owner, Shen Jinqing, once served as a court official in the township but faced accusations of embezzlement due to financial issues. Shen is skilled in maneuvering. During the time when the old warlord Qi Xieyuan served as the Jiangsu military governor, Shen became acquainted with Qi's quartermaster. All military rice purchases for Qi's troops were handled solely by Shen, resulting in significant profits. Shen Jinqing's son, Wenhua, opened the Wenji Gold Shop in Shanghai with Liu Tichen, a fellow townsman, last year. However, managing gold was not their forte, and they suffered heavy losses, amounting to over two hundred seventy thousand yuan, forcing them to close the gold shop. The large sums of money owed by Wenhua were mostly dragged from Shanghai and Suzhou banks. Consequently, his father's Shen Changyuan Rice Shop also nearly went bankrupt. The Shanghai and Suzhou financial circles have also been greatly affected. It is rumored that the Shui Hengfeng Bank in this city lost about fifty to sixty thousand gold, and the Rui Yingrun Bank also lost more than thirty thousand yuan.</p>

<p>Successive Extortion Letters from Bandits:</p>
<p>Recently, robberies have become rampant in the surrounding villages. Although the authorities have been working hard to apprehend the bandits, it has been difficult to eradicate them completely. Recently, Shen Jinhua, the owner of Demao Sen Silk Shop outside the North Gate, received a threatening letter from bandits demanding fifty thousand yuan. The other day, Zhang Heqing, the owner of Kunhe Tin Shop on Beida Street, suddenly received a threatening letter, stating that because the army lacks funds, they were borrowing three thousand silver dollars for their use. After reading the letter, Zhang Heqing ignored it.</p>

They also seized seals, appointment certificates, symbols, and more from previous years. It is said that the brigade headquarters had previously issued a notice prohibiting the recruitment of soldiers, but Yan Zhaofeng dared to impersonate a brigade commander, appoint personnel, and recruit bandits, plotting illegal activities, which is a violation of the law.

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>President Zhu Jiahua of Zhongda Returns to Guangdong Yesterday</h3>
<p>To Handle Matters at Sun Yat-sen University</p>
<p>Will Return to Beijing in Three Weeks to Take Office</p>
<p>Nanjing, 27th - Zhu Jiahua told reporters that he has been in charge of Sun Yat-sen University for a short time. The school's projects are well underway, and the salaries of the colleagues are relatively low. They were invited based on personal relationships and are willing to sacrifice for the cause. He heard nothing about his transfer to Zhongda beforehand. Since it has been announced, it is not appropriate to refuse, as it would break administrative faith. He is leaving for Guangdong tonight to handle the handover and explain everything to his colleagues so that they can be at ease with their duties. When asked about his plans to improve Zhongda, Zhu replied that he is not yet familiar with Zhongda's internal situation and organization, so he cannot talk about improvement plans at this time.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Education Funds Should Be Planned Quickly</h3>
<p>Letter from the Education Funds Management Office to the Education Funds Committee</p>
<p>Income and Expenses Fall Short by More Than 1.58 Million Yuan</p>
<p>A letter from the Jiangsu Education Funds Management Office to the Jiangsu Education Funds Committee stated:</p>
<p>Respectfully, in the past, in order to raise and distribute funds to various schools, our office first borrowed winter grain from various counties, and then borrowed cash from banks. We even moved and appropriated slaughter tax deposits, almost exhausting our resources. We have previously written to your committee, requesting you to quickly convene a meeting to discuss relief methods and open up new taxes, so that our office can have something to follow. Currently, the funds for the various schools for September and October have been decided by the Audit Committee. Funds for September have been allocated to the counties, and funds for half a month have been allocated for October. There are few reserves in the current treasury, and we must also raise funds for the winter study abroad expenses for various countries. Beyond this, we will have nothing to borrow and nothing to raise. Even when the counties have a prosperous harvest season, the grain tax has already been spent in advance. The schools require monthly expenses that cannot be intermittent. At this critical moment, we are on the verge of bankruptcy. If we do not quickly find a way to provide relief, how can we face the education of the entire province and look forward to the future without feeling terrified? Your committee is responsible for coordinating the education funds of the entire province, so how can you bear to sit idly by? Our office is responsible for management, so how dare we remain silent? Therefore, we are compelled to bother you again and again, and present to you in detail the situation of the shortfall in income and expenses for this year. According to the budget of 4,896,552 yuan for this year, our office estimates the revenue from various taxes to be 3,700,000 yuan, assuming the most prosperous harvest year. Currently, from the beginning of the year, July 1st to November 15th, the revenue from various taxes is 815,324.34 yuan, the amount borrowed from the grain tax is 313,273.36 yuan, and the amount borrowed from the bank is 120,000 yuan, totaling 1,248,597.7 yuan. Furthermore, 339,837.62 yuan has been allocated to the counties for school expenses, and 71,337.7 yuan in expenses have been issued but not transferred from the previous year, totaling 1,659,772.39 yuan. It is estimated that by the end of the year, in addition to the borrowed and allocated funds mentioned above, we can still collect 2,040,227.61 yuan from various taxes, plus 171,980 yuan in school administrative revenue, totaling 2,212,270.61 yuan. On the expenditure side, in addition to the surplus of 90,528.37 yuan from the previous year, 410,101.27 yuan has been taken from this year's revenue, and 1,233,504.35 yuan in expenses have already been spent in the first half of the year from July to October. According to the full-year budget, we still need 3,660,347.65 yuan to balance the budget by next June. This leaves a shortfall of 1,458,840.4 yuan. Adding the 135,000 yuan borrowed from the slaughter tax deposit from the previous year, the total shortfall is 1,585,840.4 yuan. Even if the subsidies from the Ministry of Finance and the Department of Finance listed in the budget are received in full, it will still be insufficient, and there is no certainty of that. The numbers listed above are all based on actual calculations, and cannot be glossed over with empty words. We urge your committee to investigate the previous cases, quickly convene an emergency meeting to discuss relief measures, and we are extremely anxious to await your orders. Furthermore, the Provincial Department of Finance subsidizes 300,000 yuan, and the Provincial Government decided to allocate 25,000 yuan per month, but so far only 10,000 yuan has been received for July. Also, an order to pay 15,000 yuan has been repeatedly negotiated with the bank, but has not yet been received. As for the other months, we have repeatedly requested in vain. As for the 200,000 yuan from the Ministry of Finance, our office has no basis for it. We are attaching this information for your reference. This is to the Jiangsu Education Funds Committee.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Holds Review Meeting for Agricultural Courses in Senior High Schools</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Ministry of Education held a review meeting for the curriculum standards for agricultural courses in senior high schools. Chen Zongyi, Fu Huangguang, Gu Shusen, and others attended.

The chairman respectfully read the will and announced the opening of the meeting. 1. Proposal to increase land purchases and expand equipment. Resolution: The school's campus is narrow, and the current state of development cannot meet its needs. It is indeed necessary to increase purchases and expansion. President Li and the standing committee members should formulate a plan and actively proceed with the board. The board appointed Director Qian Xinzhi to be responsible for the liaison. 2. President Li's resignation. Resolution: President Li has made great contributions to the school's management and creation. His morality and knowledge have long been respected. The request to resign is difficult to approve. A letter of retention should be sent immediately, and Directors Zhang Tinghao and Jiang Yiping should be appointed to represent the board and convey their sincerity. 3. Secretary-General Jin's resignation. Resolution: The board will send a letter to President Li, who will forward it to Secretary-General Jin to earnestly persuade him to stay. The attending directors will also send letters in their personal capacity to urge him to return to the school immediately. 4. Director of the Experimental Middle School. Resolution: Whether the agreement signed between Fudan and the Experimental Middle School on May 17, 1929, still needs to exist should be requested from President Li and the faculty and staff of the Experimental Middle School with reasons, to be decided at the next board meeting. President Li and the faculty and staff of the Experimental Middle School should each recommend three candidates for the position of director of the Experimental Middle School, and the board will decide on one person to be appointed by President Li.</p>
<p>Another report says that yesterday, President Li of the school said that since the board of directors can wholeheartedly support the economic aspects and take full responsibility for fundraising, it will be very easy to purchase more land and expand equipment to seek the development of the school. Although he is old, he is also willing to sacrifice his energy and follow the gentlemen of the board of directors to cultivate talents for the party and the country, and immediately dispelled his intention to resign.</p>
<p>Also, Yu Youren, a director of the school, personally wrote a letter to President Li, saying: Mr. Deng, I am very concerned about the school affairs and have been exhausting your virtuous labor. Who recites your letter and admires your humility? The school has been entrusted to you for a long time. I cannot belong to anyone else but you. The 25th anniversary is the time for the school to develop, not the day for you to retire. Your instructions are sincere and truly private. God bless our school, please continue for another 25 years, it should be put to vote at this moment. This is not the time. I respectfully bow and hope you will understand. Yu Youren respectfully, 12th day.</p>

<h3>Jiangwan and Zhenru Win West Youth Basketball Games Last Night</h3>
<p>| Eagle Team Wins Jiyong (Group B) |</p>
<p>26 to 23</p>
<p>| Jiangwan Wins Zhonggong (Group A) |</p>
<p>31 to 21</p>
<p>| Zhenru Wins Huadong (Group A) |</p>
<p>40 to 34</p>
<p>Last night, the West Youth Basketball Association held a total of three games. The results were: (1) Eagle Team defeated Jiyong (Group B), 26 to 23; (2) Jiangwan defeated Zhonggong (Group A), 31 to 21; (3) Zhenru defeated Huadong (Group A), 40 to 34. The last game was the most intense and exciting.</p>
<p>(1) Eagle Team Wins Jiyong (B1)</p>
<p>This was a Group B game. The strength of the two teams was very close, and the competition was very fierce. Jiyong was one of Guanghua's teams. The situation was very good in the first half, winning 12 to 10. Unfortunately, the Eagle Team caught up quickly in the second half, and the Eagle Team won 26 to 23. Hu Zhikang, the left forward of the Eagle Team, scored 14 points alone.</p>
<p>(2) Jiangwan Defeats Zhonggong (Group A)</p>
<p>Jiangwan shows its power this time Jiangwan (Fudan athletes) has a very strong strength, and it seems easy to defeat Zhonggong yesterday, and Zhonggong's failure to throw the basket may also be due to bad luck. At first, Zhang Jinxiang from Jiangwan opened the scoring, and Guan Yi from Zhonggong returned it. Mo Mingquan, the center of Jiangwan, raised his hand for a long shot and took the lead. Mo and Wu Shuqian continued to make contributions, but Zhonggong was unable to do anything. The first half was 13 to 6, and Jiangwan won.</p>
<p>Zhonggong's setback Zhonggong's defenders seem to be stronger than the forwards, but defending against Fudan's three forwards is very difficult. Mo Mingquan is a famous player with a majestic demeanor, scoring one after another with lively and agile skills. There is no comparison at one time. Zhonggong was badly hurt in the first half, and although He Yanzhang succeeded in a long shot, it was quite difficult to recover. Jiangwan finally defeated it by 31 to 21.</p>
<p>Jiangwan</p>
<p>Name, position, shots made, free throws, fouls, score: Wu Shuqian, right forward, 3 times, 1 time, 2 times, 7; Guan Jinlin, left forward, 0 times, 0 times, 0 times, 0; Mo Mingquan, center, 9 times, 0 times, 2 times, 18; Zhang Jinxiang, right guard, 2 times, 0 times, 0 times, 4; Chen Mingjue, left guard, 1 time, 0 times, 1 time, 2; Total 15, 1, 5, 31.</p>
<p>Zhonggong</p>
<p>He Yanzhang, right forward, 4 times, 1 time, 1 time, 9; Wei Zuohan, left forward, 1 time, 0 times, 0 times, 2; Zhu Kaiming, left forward, 1 time, 0 times, 0 times, 2; Chen Baoqiu, center, 2 times, 0 times, 2 times, 4; Guan Yi, right guard, 1 time, 1 time, 2 times, 3; Liao Lie, left guard, 0 times, 1 time, 1 time, 1; Total 9, 3, 6, 21. First half Jiangwan 13 points Zhonggong 6 points. Second half Jiangwan 18 points Zhonggong 15 points.</p>
<p>(2) Zhenru Defeats Huadong (Group A)</p>
<p>Smooth sailing Zhenru is also a strong team, and it is difficult to say who is better than Huadong. As soon as the two armies met, Liang Guoquan grabbed the ball and failed to shoot, while Zhenru Chen Zhenhe made a successful shot and opened the scoring first. Since then, it has been smooth sailing, and Zhenru is far ahead with 12 to 2.</p>
<p>Changing the strategy Huadong changed its front in the face of unpromising progress, adding Wang Weishen and replacing Ling Xianyuan and Chuanchuan Wuqiao as the right forwards. Huadong gradually caught up, and the first half was 20 to 15, with Zhenru taking the lead.</p>
<p>Sneak attack successfully In the second half, Huadong's momentum suddenly increased. Liang Guoquan scored nine points in a row with his exquisite skills, resulting in a 25-point tie. The whole game suddenly became tense. Lu Zhongen succeeded in a sneak attack under the basket and suddenly took the lead with 27 to 25.</p>
<p>Long shots repeatedly made The victory of Zhenru over Huadong can be said to be due to the accuracy of their shooting. Huang Li can be called a pair of heroes, and their repeated long shots are the fatal injury of Huadong. After the score was tied at 30-30, Zhenru repeatedly shot and made, and finally won 40-34. The referee was Belle Si.</p>
<p>Name One position made shot free throw foul foul score Huang Zhaolin right front eight second two times eighteen Cai Rongrui left front four times times three times eight Li Chengyuan center five times times two times ten Chen Zhenhe right guard one times times three times two Zhang Qiying left guard one times times times two Total nineteen second nine times forty</p>

<h3>Second Day of the China Liangjiang Sports Meet</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the joint sports meet of the China Liangjiang Men's and Women's Physical Education Schools. The program was purely track and field events, which started at 2 PM. There were 52 Chinese athletes and 242 Liangjiang athletes. About 6,000 to 7,000 guests visited the venue. The order of the venue was still maintained by the Shanghai Boy Scouts. The athletes actively participated and competed to be the first to achieve good results. Chen Xueru's long jump and Zhu Wencheng's high jump in Liangjiang both broke the national records for this year. It is not easy for the China Sports School to achieve this result in less than three months after its resumption. The results of yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>China Sports School</p>
<p>Event 1st Place 2nd Place 3rd Place 4th Place Result Long Jump Chen Xueru Yang Tingsheng Zhou Zengmei Yang Shigen 6.07 meters High Jump Chen Lie Xu Dongshan 1.5 meters Lin Xi Zhang Xiaoshi 0 meters 110 Meters Cao Runyu Chen Lie Yan Zi Dong Ji'an 20 seconds High Hurdles 1500 Meters Zheng Xueru Shi Guanqing Zhu Zazhi Xi Shengxiu 4 minutes 400 meters 7.6 seconds</p>
<p>Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School</p>
<p>High Jump Zhu Wencheng Sheng Weiying Ma Wu Qian Weizhen 1.25 meters Javelin Ma Wu Xiang Dawei Fan Ruimei Wang Wanhua 14.35 meters Also, due to the large number of athletes from the two schools, the preliminary round took time, and all the events have not yet been completed, so today's competition will be held early, starting at 9 AM. The location is still the China Track and Field Stadium.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Table Tennis Association Holds Staff Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Table Tennis Association will hold a staff meeting at the Ping Pong Room of the Jiande Society on Fusheng Road at 10 AM on the 30th to prepare for the United Cup competition and the China-Japan Championship of the Count Arima Cup in Japan. Mr. Yu Binqi, Zou Guxin, Lu Xiulu, Lu Zhongqiu, Yang Xiqing and others are required to attend.</p>
<h3>Champagne Cup Table Tennis Finals Location</h3>
<p>At the Ningbo Association</p>
<p>The Champagne Cup table tennis tournament, which has been fought for hundreds of times in a round robin by twenty-four teams at sea, has largely determined the situation of each team, and only the championship remains to be decided. The finalists are still the Tianma team and the Jiande team (the first champion was the Tianma team, and the second champion was the Jiande team), who have each won repeatedly with their magical power (according to the first champion was the Tianma team, the second champion was the Jiande team). Although the strong enemy Guangdong Table Tennis Association participated in the competition, it was still eliminated by the championship team that had won once each, so the situation of the Tianma and Jiande teams is again in the position of confrontation.</p>
<p>It is reported that the staff of the cup competition is now planning to rent the Ningbo Association on Xizang Road to hold the finals. The date is approaching, about this time. Once it is set, it will be announced immediately.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Sea Guest</p>
<p>Father—Child, you've already eaten three bowls of rice today. Your stomach must be full. Why do you want to add more?</p>
<p>Son—I still don't feel full. Besides, the dishes are so good today.</p>
<p>Father—You're so greedy. If people see you, they might say you're a little pig. Do you know what a little pig is?</p>
<p>Son—I know. A little pig is the son of an old pig, isn't it?</p>
<p>Doctor (after eating a meal in a restaurant, asks the waiter)—How much is it altogether?</p>
<p>Waiter—Altogether it's one dollar and twenty cents.</p>
<p>Doctor (fumbling around)—Oh dear. I only brought one dollar with me today. What should I do? Ah, I have an idea. Let me take a look at your tongue and check your pulse.</p>
<p>Waiter—What's that supposed to be?</p>
<p>Doctor—I think you might be sick. Consider the twenty cents a special, discounted consultation fee.</p>
<p>Woman A—Mr. C wrote to me this time to propose marriage. His words in the letter were unusually sincere, saying he'd rather die than not marry me. But I returned it to him. He didn't seem to mind. What's the reason for that?</p>
<p>Woman B—Ah. He's originally a novelist. When he submits manuscripts to bookstores, nine out of ten get returned. So, he's used to it.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Field Drill in Pudong</h3>
<p>— Wang Naixiu</p>
<p>Since Mr. He Yingqin took office as Director-General of Training, he issued an order that students above high school level must receive two years of military training. Our Minli Middle School actively implemented it with outstanding results. Military instructor Liu Fenglin's instruction emphasized strictness and practicality. Therefore, on the 21st of this month, he led the healthy soldiers to the field drill at Yangsi Bridge in Pudong, and specially purchased fifty dollars of firecrackers to use as imitation bullets. On that day, the sky was high and clear, and the wind was gentle and sunny. At 8 a.m., the three companies of healthy soldiers were lined up on the field, full of energy. The first company was fully armed with rifles. The second and third companies carried water bottles and food bags, etc. The bags contained bread and fruit for lunch. Under the fluttering flags and the sound of military music, instructor Liu led the departure. The military band marched at the head of the line, and the military appearance along the way was solemn and the pace was neat, which was awe-inspiring. When we arrived at the Gaochangmiao riverside pier, we bought seven boats to cross the river. Swaying in the heart of the river, we could see the scenery on both sides at a glance. The sound of the water was gurgling, and the sound of the wind rustling responded to each other. Warships and wheel boats were parked in a row along the coast. The Yixian ship, which was launched on the birthday of the President, was also berthed here. From a distance, the ship was freshly painted and very majestic. Before long, we arrived at Zhoujiadu in Pudong. We disembarked and proceeded to Yangsi Bridge. After walking for two li, instructor Liu ordered the first platoon of the first company to be the vanguard, advancing alone to scout whether there were enemy ambushes ahead, and sent two sentries to stand guard on the mounds. The rear teams divided up the firecrackers and prepared for the field battle. Each class had a bugler to signal. When the vanguard soldiers waved the lure flag, the sentries would rush back to report the discovery of the enemy. Instructor Liu then directed the platoon leaders to lead their subordinates to disperse and skirmish on the tombs on both sides of the railway. The soldiers of each class were ambushed in the rear, lit the firecrackers and began shooting. For a time, the sound of explosions was like thunder, and the smoke filled the air as if they were in a rain of bullets. Suddenly, the sound of a march was heard, and the soldiers of each class also echoed the drums. Our army crouched and held guns, bravely charging forward, killing sounds were shaking the sky, like rabbits escaping. After about hundreds of paces, they still chose a place to hide and continue shooting for about twenty minutes. When the return signal sounded loudly, they lowered their flags and silenced their drums, returned to the team, and assembled. Everyone was covered in mud. The drill was over. They went straight to Yangsi Primary School in Yangsi Bridge to rest. Each took out the bread they carried for lunch. After a short rest, they lined up and called the roll. Instructor Liu gave a speech, commending them for their hard work. On the way back, they were still full of energy and without any fatigue. By the time they returned to school, the sun had already set.</p>
<h3>Various Kinds of Crabs</h3>
<p>— Yang Yixiao</p>
<p>The taste of crab is the freshest, so everyone likes to eat it. In addition to fresh cooking, there are also methods such as quick marinating, drunken marinating, and paste marinating. Crab lovers should know how to choose.</p>
<p>Quick-Marinated Crab: Take the crab, wash it, and put it in a jar. Add scallions, ginger, and good soy sauce, and seal it tightly for three days. After the soy sauce has penetrated, it can be opened and eaten.</p>
<p>Drunken Crab: First put the crab in a jar and pour in two catties of old wine. Seal it tightly. The so-called jade marrow and golden paste are deeply brewed.</p>
<p>Paste Crab: Use live crabs, fermented rice wine, and fresh paste. The paste and meat are tender and delicious, like fresh paste eggs. It should be eaten within two or three days after opening.</p>
<p>Soybean Paste Crab: Choose small round-navel crabs. Put them in a jar and steam them over water until cooked. After taking them out, spread the shells with soybean paste and put them in a large bowl and mix well. It can be eaten in three days.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from a Solo Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>This untalented individual, in recent years, due to family upheavals and environmental pressures, having no one to confide in about all the suffering, grief, and indignation, has poured it all into painting. This has slightly alleviated the pent-up resentment, and my painting has also made some progress as a result. However, the sea of art is vast, and a vole can only drink so much. How much can I achieve? With my meager understanding, I earnestly wish to seek guidance from those who are knowledgeable, so I am publicly exhibiting nearly a hundred recent works and have specially arranged a preview, respectfully inviting renowned artists in Shanghai to offer their corrections, so that I may follow them. I have been wrongly showered with praise, excessively adorned, and people have competed to order my works, which were instantly sold out. This has resulted in those who came to the opening unable to satisfy their viewing desires. I had no choice but to hold a second exhibition for pre-orders, to avoid disappointment. Unexpectedly, in less than two days, pre-orders exceeded a hundred pieces. The date for the second opening was set for the twentieth and twenty-first days of the twelfth lunar month, which is very soon. I dare not be greedy for more and act hastily, disappointing those with refined tastes. Therefore, I stopped pre-orders ahead of schedule. Those who wished to pre-order on the third day had to wait until next year, and yet, another sixty or so pieces were pre-ordered in a single day. I have always been known among my peers for the speed of my production, but even I am now exhausted from keeping up. It is estimated that in the three days of the exhibition, in addition to the hundred exhibited pieces being completely sold out, more than a hundred and seventy pieces were pre-ordered. And the number of visitors reached more than three thousand. Even senior masters like Cheng Yaosheng graced us with their presence, breaking protocol. I am deeply concerned that my talent is limited, my knowledge is shallow, my brush is clumsy, and my ink is inferior, and that I will not be able to meet the earnest expectations of all circles. I can only strive to improve myself and dare not be complacent about this. Among the exhibited works, No. 33, "Southern Mountain Green Screen," and No. 86, "Autumn River Evening Ferry," received the most pre-orders. On the first day, fourteen people each ordered them. On the second day, No. 33 increased to eighteen people, and No. 86 increased to twenty-four people. On the third day, No. 33 increased to twenty-nine people, and No. 86 actually increased to forty-five people. Red stickers were lined up in two rows from the axis to the top, with no room to spare. A friend jokingly said that the two paintings were quite like the "Grand Champion" in horse racing. A Japanese person, Yamada Kenkichi, ordered one of No. 33, and a German person, Fang Haler, ordered one of No. 86, also distantly facing each other. Next were No. 65, "Reading the Yi in a Pine Studio," with nineteen people, and No. 1, "Three Peaks on the River," with ten people. And the original orderers of these four paintings were Zhang Shanzi, Zhang Daqian, and Huang Binhong, the president of the painting society, two brothers, and one person, all living in the same house, which is quite remarkable. The discerning eyes of famous artists are indeed extraordinary. On the morning of the second day, as soon as the arrangement was completed, only two or three visitors came, and the album of pages, "Serving Mother," which was not for sale, had mysteriously disappeared. A thorough search yielded nothing. On the third day, a friend came from an antique tea party and said, "Yesterday, someone was selling an album of pages, asking for a loan of two hundred yuan." This gentleman's technique of opening boxes does not concede to the legendary thief "Amazing Hands Empty." It is a pity that my paintings are not worth much money; it is a bit of a waste of a great talent.</p>
<h3>Mei Lanfang's Upcoming Performance</h3>
<p>— Master of the Vase Studio</p>
<p>Changing strategy to perform more old plays</p>
<p>After returning north from performing last year, Mei Lanfang declared that he would no longer appear on stage. The connoisseurs of Shanghai, upon hearing this news, were all disappointed. Now, good news has arrived: Mei Lanfang will come to Shanghai to sing again, to bid a final farewell to the people of Shanghai. Therefore, this performance by Mei Lanfang is even more worthy of our excitement. It is said that Mei Lanfang plans to change his strategy this time, performing more old plays and fewer new ones. Such as "The Mad Woman" (Cosmic Rhyme), the complete version, "Snow Cup Edge," "Yu Tang Chun," "Woman Escorted," "Four Lang Visits His Mother," "Farewell My Concubine," "Sacrificing to the River," "Thirteen Sisters," "The Drunken Concubine," and other plays, will be performed in order to meet the needs of all circles. (The Beka Company has the films of Mei's "Visiting Mother," "Cosmic Rhyme," "Woman Escorted," and "Farewell to Tang Dynasty," and sales are surprisingly strong. This proves the popularity of old plays in the musical theater world.) As for the full-length play "Yang Guifei," which he arranged himself, the subject matter is righteous and the arrangement is appropriate. In the areas of Tianjin and Peking, every performance is sold out. Its charm is not weaker than that of the old plays. Therefore, he also plans to perform it this time, so that those who love to watch new plays will not have the regret of missing out. (Mei's three "Yang Guifei" recordings at Beka, with dialogue and singing, are extremely well-structured. The "Erh Huang Duoban" melody is novel and is one of the most brilliant parts of the complete "Yang Guifei.")</p>
<h3>Record of Dismissing a Concubine</h3>
<p>— Yan Ye</p>
<p>There is a Mr. Zhang, a guest in Shanghai. In a certain year, he once held a military command, and after much hard work, he was able to write proclamations. He was especially skilled in poetry and had the reputation of being a refined general. Now that he has resigned, he enjoys poetry and wine all the more. His later years are extremely joyful. Zhang has two concubines, who are sisters, who were bought from a brothel by his friend and presented to him many years ago. They are deeply favored by Zhang, burning incense and adding tea, never leaving his side. When he goes out, he also takes them with him. In the beautiful days of spring and autumn, in the famous scenic areas of Suzhou and Zhejiang, there are often traces of them. They look like celestial couples. This autumn, Zhang took his two concubines to the West Lake again, staying at his friend's house. In a few days, they had traveled all over the North and South Peaks. One day, they went to Lingyin Temple. After touring around, as they were about to leave, a monk suddenly stepped forward, put his palms together, and said, "Sir, are you enjoying your tour of West Lake? Traveling by the lake, with women in the carriage, leisurely on the water, carrying the West Lake with you, you are truly like a celestial being." Zhang was stunned. He stared at him for a long time, as if he recognized him. He said, "Are you so-and-so? Why are you a monk now?" The monk said, "Yes. I was your commander in a certain regiment under you. I have been here for three years." When asked why he entered the monastery, he smiled and said nothing. He only asked about Zhang's residence. Zhang returned to his residence, feeling disappointed. He stayed indoors for three days. Suddenly, a messenger came, delivering a letter to Zhang. He opened it and saw a few words. After reading it, he slammed the table in anger, then became silent, and finally shed tears. He then threw the letter into the fire. He hastily led his two concubines back to Shanghai. People were very surprised. After Zhang returned to Shanghai, he went out at night and did not return. When he returned the next morning, he took out two thousand gold coins from his pocket and placed them in front of the two women, ordering each to take half, saying, "Now we part. Take this with you and return to your hometown. Having this, you can live in the countryside for the rest of your life. The world is colorful, but it is useless to linger. Brothels are even more of a hell. Do not fall into it again." The two women did not want to leave, and tears fell like rain. Zhang had no pity and urged them to leave quickly. The two women knew they could not stay, so they each took their belongings and left crying. As they reached the door, they still turned their heads. Zhang smiled and waved them goodbye, repeatedly shouting, "Relief! Relief!" After the two women left, Zhang spent all day writing in the air, grumbling to himself. Ten days later, he left his family and has been gone for two months. No one knows where he is. I heard about this and said it was a strange thing. So I recorded it.</p>
<h3>Travelogue to Southeast Asia (85)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>July 2nd, rain. Wanted to visit the zoo, but couldn't understand the local language and returned without finding it. Mr. Yang Jiangshui came and offered to take me. So I went with him. Exited 22nd Chinatown, went on White Pagoda Road. The tram costs two copper coins per person. The trams in Rangoon are not as crowded as those in Japan and Shanghai. The ticket seller is also experienced and treats customers calmly. The level of our Chinese citizens is not even as good as that of Siam, and still below that of the Burmese. If you don't believe it, try comparing it with the tram drivers. Passed the Buddhist boys' school established by Queen Victoria of England. There is also a Buddhist girls' school established by Queen Victoria. Is this also a way to appease the Burmese? Got off the tram at the Great Golden Pagoda. Then took a small horse-drawn carriage. Three annas for two people, a total of twelve copper coins. Then arrived at the zoo. The road is very clean. Forests and lakes surround the park. But I had no guide at first. Couldn't find my way around a small area. A car asked for two shields from me. Each shield is worth one yuan and three cents in Chinese currency. Alas. The wonderful realm of the Great Dao is right in front of us. With a guide, it is easy to find. Without a guide, one is lost. From this, we can understand that the world cannot be without a great teacher. The entrance ticket is two annas, each anna being four copper coins. This park is a famous park in East Asia. The scale is quite impressive. The architecture has different points. It is very different from the Beijing Zoo. Although the latter has a large number of animals and plants, the architecture and management of this place are worth learning from. I hope that future visitors will pay attention to it. Because it is not easy to keep animals in a zoo, the technology of feeding, management, and architecture needs to be studied. But although its location is large, there are not many types of animals.</p>
<p>Upon entering the park, I first saw several lions, grayish-blue in color. The sizes of the males and females were also roughly equal. Next were several tigers. People say that there is the character "king" on the tiger's head. It's true. All the houses here have a space below to avoid moisture. The tiger sheds are also like this, living on the floor. The excrement must be swept and washed by workers. When workers want to enter the tiger's shed, they first use iron rods to trick the tigers into the inner room. After the tigers enter, the iron gate in the room suddenly falls from above. The workers can then enter and sweep the excrement. But this method is quite clumsy. It seems that a better method needs to be devised.</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart (323)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Cui Xiu Diligently Asks the Teacher for Writing Advice; Generously Discussing Military Affairs, the Heroine Parties in a Brothel</p>
<p>Most of those who make a living through writing suffer from stomach problems. And eating that kind of packed lunch makes people even more uncomfortable. If you come out after having dinner at home, the time isn't right. Going back late means you'll be hungry. Although there are occasional social gatherings, or someone invites the reporters from the newspaper to have dinner, this is a particularly rare occurrence. Because in the past, society in general didn't value the press as much as it does now. People in political circles regarded them as the scum of intellectuals. Ordinary people also said that they were just talking nonsense, and didn't know that newspapers were a propaganda machine. Inviting a reporter to dinner has little effect. And the reporters of the past were unwilling to eat other people's food easily, as if eating their food would shut their mouths. There had to be an introduction and a clear understanding of the facts. They wouldn't just come when beckoned and leave when dismissed. They had to maintain a certain aloofness, a bit of an arrogant attitude, unlike the approachability they have now. There were even two reporters who absolutely wouldn't attend outside social functions, preferring to burn a kerosene stove and eat rice soaked in tea in their small rooms, unwilling to parade around in the name of a reporter. Therefore, when it came to the dinner problem, it was best to have two or three close friends, drink wine, and talk. Fortunately, there are many restaurants in Shanghai. Eating at this one tonight, and that one tomorrow. It doesn't cost much, and you can change the flavor every night. This can be considered a joy among friends. It's just that these consecutive nights of dinners for Zuo Shichen all involved meeting with Green Intent. Once people become familiar, all shyness disappears. Before, when a lady came to sing, she would always sit quietly to the side, looking down and fiddling with her handkerchief. If you looked at her, she would smile back at you. If you asked her a question, she would at most answer you with one sentence. Sometimes that one sentence would be shortened to two words, one word. If you asked further, there would be no words at all. Or she would nod or shake her head to indicate her agreement or disagreement. It took five or six nights, like a connoisseur playing with an antique jade, gradually getting familiar. On stage, she would gradually talk and laugh. Plus, there was Ah Su by her side, like a musician accompanying. Because Green Intent had a shortcoming: she couldn't sing very well. Although she could hum a few lines, she thought she sang poorly and was afraid to sing. This suited Zuo Shichen's temperament. Zuo Shichen said, "I just don't understand singing. If I don't understand, I don't understand. Why pretend to be an expert?" Sometimes, if someone who was good at singing came along, they could sing with proper rhythm and inflection, and everyone would clap in time, which was naturally very good. The listeners would find it enjoyable, and the singer would add to the excitement. But if someone who wasn't very good at singing was forced to sing, they would turn red in the face and neck, exhaust themselves, and the song they sang would still be a bit out of tune. It's better to hide your clumsiness.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Prices Plunge Sharply</h3>
<p>Bulls Exit, Bears Increase Positions. Yesterday, the price of gold continued to weaken, and the downward trend became even more severe, breaking the 590 tael mark, with a sharp drop of more than nine taels. There were fluctuations of five taels throughout the day, but the waves were turbulent and extremely chaotic. Both the official and unofficial exchange rates for foreign currency loosened. The listed price has lengthened by half a grade. Banks were mostly absorbing, but there were also sales at times. Overseas silver markets were mediocre. The fact that the earthquake in Japan has been confirmed has caused panic in the market. Major players such as Yifengyong, Yufengyong, Yuanmaoyong, Chengfengyong, and Yuda are selling vigorously. Bulls are eager to exit. Some bears are adding to their positions. However, Fuchang, Tongtaichang, Wanxing, and Shunli are all buying. The desire to buy goods is especially strong, but the market price opened low and then weakened further, with a sharp drop of eight taels, suddenly falling below eighty-five taels. Afterwards, due to different buyers and sellers, the situation varied, with fluctuations of two taels at times. Later, the selling pressure increased, with Dadecheng, Yuda, and Yuanxingyong all selling. However, the Dalian gang continued to buy, causing the market to weaken further and the downward trend to be unstoppable. It ended at a little over eighty-three taels. In the past two days, there has been a drastic drop of more than ten taels, which is truly unexpected.</p>
<p>The morning opened with a sharp drop of four taels and five qian. The opening price for the January contract in the morning was 588 taels and three qian, a drop of four taels and five qian. The raw silver price initially was from ninety-two taels to two and a half qian, dropping sharply by more than four qian in an instant, due to Yuanchengyong, Yifengyong, Yuanmaoyong, and others selling first. However, the large bars remained unchanged. Subsequently, due to Yuanchengyong, Yifengyong, Chengfengyong, and others leaning towards selling, market sentiment weakened further, and prices fell another four taels, to only eighty-four taels and four qian. Then, Zhejiang bought December English gold at 17125, and Mitsui bought March at 1875. After entering, Zhifengyong, Yuanmaoyong, and others dragged it up, suddenly jumping up three or four taels, to eighty-eight taels. Then, the sellers became aggressive, returning one tael and zero qian. The initial announcement was already one or two five longer, US gold was two five longer, and Japanese gold dropped by one point. At that time, it was eighty-six taels. Then there was a fluctuation of one tael. Zhengjin Bank ate January English gold at 17125, Datong and Zhengjin did the current month's Citibank at 38 yuan and 625, and Tongtaichang, Shunli, Wanxing, and others chased after it, adding more than one tael, reaching eighty-seven taels and six seven qian at 10 o'clock. Subsequently, Yifengyong, Yuanchengyong, Yuda, Yuanmao, Yong, and others continued to sell, suddenly dropping another two taels. In just ten minutes, it dropped to five taels and six seven qian, then immediately returned one tael and seven eight qian, to seven taels and three four qian. In short, income and expenditure were different, and people's hearts were confused, so it rose and fell suddenly, feeling very at a loss. After 10:30, there was another rise and fall of more than one tael, hovering between eighty-seven taels and five taels. After 11 o'clock, it was good for another two taels. Banks absorbed January English gold from 171875 to 125. At 11:10, it was seven taels and two qian, then it shed another two taels or so. Zhifengyong and retail investors sold, and at 11:45, it was four taels and eight nine qian. In an instant, it pulled up more than one tael, to six taels and two three qian. Fuchang and hedgers bought. By noon, the market closed at six taels, and the listed price had been changed to 627 taels. Because Japanese gold was listed down by a small point, the calculation was pressed at around 40 taels to 41 or 2 taels.</p>
<p>The ending continued to fall eight taels and nine qian. The afternoon market opened at six taels and four qian (the raw silver price was from six taels and two three qian to six taels and a half). Later, because the Indian exchange rate was seen to rise by two annas, it fell to eighty-five taels and two qian. Then, because Zhifengyong and Fuchang bought, it rose by one tael and zero qian. At 2:45, it was six taels and a half. Then, Sumitomo ate January English gold at 171875, and Wheat Bank issued March at the same price. Then, it bought January again, still at 171875. After this, the selling pressure in the market suddenly increased. Yuanheng, Yuanxingyong, Yuancheng, Yuanchengyong, Yufayong, Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, and others leaned towards selling, but the Dalian gang bought, and the price plummeted by more than three taels, to eighty-three taels and three qian at 3:30. At that time, Tongtaichang and Fuchang bought, suddenly pulling up several qian again, to four taels and one qian around 4 o'clock. However, Dadecheng and others still spat it out. Then, Wheat Bank issued January English gold at 17125, which was bought by Yifengyong, so the bars were hedged, and it was cut down by another one tael, to eighty-three taels and two qian at 4:20. By 4:30, the market closed at eighty-three taels and nine qian, a drop of eight taels and nine qian compared to the day before. After that, it was still flat, with no more than one or two qian up or down, and the maximum price for the day was eight taels and four qian, and the minimum price was three taels and two qian, a fluctuation of five taels and two qian. Calculated according to the listed price, the listed price was pressed at between forty taels and forty-three taels. The December account was 89 taels, and the January account was 86 taels. Supplementary water was from 93 taels to 91 taels. The early market for goods was eight taels and two qian, the noon close was six taels and three qian, the afternoon was six taels and three qian, and the closing price was four taels.</p>
<p>Transactions were quite prosperous for a while. Peer-to-peer transactions were quite smooth. It is estimated that Zhifengyong, Yuancheng, Shunli, Wanxing, Fuchang, etc. all bought. The goods actually bought six or seven thousand bars. Hedgers also bought, so they sold exchange drafts. Chengfengyong, Yuda, Yifengyong, Yuanmaoyong, etc. bought a large number of bulls, totaling more than 10,000 bars. Yufengyong issued more than 1,000 bars. Yuanchengyong, Fuxingyong Hongli, Xinxing, Xieyu, Yufayong, etc. also sold. In the afternoon, Tongtaichang, Shunli, Fuchang, Zhifengyong, and Wanxing all bought, but they also sold at times. In summary, purchases exceeded sales. Yuancheng, Yuanchengyong, Yuanxingyong, Chengfengyong, Yuanmaoyong, Yuda, Yifengyong, Hongli, etc. all sold. Dadecheng issued about 1,000 bars. The income and expenditure of goods varied. There were also various numbers, with income and expenditure being unpredictable. In short, the major bulls did not sell, and were about to turn into bears. The Dalian gang bought five or six thousand bars and sold one thousand several hundred bars. The Guangdong gang still had no large transactions.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Raw Cotton Market Shows Little Fluctuation</h3>
<p>The yarn market is stable. 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd brand yarn from Taiyuan is piling up, and the sales of this yarn are becoming more sluggish. The demand for yarn among merchant guilds is also becoming more quiet. Moreover, with the New Year approaching, most people are psychologically inclined to expect a drop in prices. However, due to settlement considerations, there may be a slight upward trend in the near future, which is also unknown.</p>
<p>The raw cotton auction is stable. The opening price of the raw cotton auction market was still weak because of the continuous drop in American cotton prices, and the trading atmosphere in the market was not strong, and prices decreased by two cents each. After two or three rounds of price changes, the market was generally stable. The afternoon market conditions were slightly stronger because of the problem of factory tax, and there were fewer sellers. Prices for each month rose by two or three cents, and the total transaction volume for the day was 8,500 bales. It was found that Hengyi sold 1,200 bales, Changfeng sold 400 bales, Dafeng sold 650 bales, and Shenchang sold 550 bales, and the remaining bales sold were between 200-400 bales each. Yichang bought 400 bales, Yuanxing bought 300 bales, Yudai bought 450 bales, and Meiji bought 700 bales, and the remaining bales bought were between 100-400 bales each.

<h3>Cotton Market Weak in the Morning, Rebounds in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The cotton market was weak in the morning and firm in the afternoon. American cotton continued to trend downward. Most Shanghai merchant guilds tended to buy and go long. However, due to the obstruction of sources from Hankou, they were unable to actively pursue this strategy. Rural farmers resisted and did not sell. However, the sales of raw cotton completely stalled. Some people took the opportunity to short sell when prices rose. Their attitude was also calm. Judging from the overall situation, the market will not break out of its sideways trend.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Cotton Meanders. The opening price of the Hankou standard cotton market was slightly weak because of the continuous drop in American cotton prices for several days, and prices decreased by five cents to one cent each.

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Cloudy, Turns Stable</h3>
<p>In Zhabei, about forty or fifty boats arrived yesterday from various routes, but market sales were active due to the cloudy weather. The purchasing power of all parties was extremely good, and the common Jiangsu white japonica rice saw an increase, with the specially top-grade rice about to reach the 15 yuan mark. The trading of ordinary grades was very good. However, by noon, the sales appetite had faded, and the overall trend was not easy to move upward. The price of Bo rice was stable because the price of japonica rice was stable. The sales of Yangxian rice was very active, and the market trend was tight. The price of Du rice and Jian rice were increased by half, and the wholesale prices of Ke rice and Bu rice were very refreshing. Therefore, the situation was brisk. The price of Bian Yuan was not as strong as the two previous markets, and the prices were slightly decreased by two jiao, and the price of Yin Yuan was still around 13 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than 30 ships arrived at the river in South Shanghai. The sales in the street were very brisk in the morning due to the cloudy weather, and all prices rose. At noon, the weather cleared up and turned flat again. White japonica rice therefore had a fluctuation of one and a half jiao, and the result was the same as the previous day. The initial sales of white japonica rice from Suzhou and Tongzhou were also very brisk, but soon became stagnant. The sales of Nanbang Bo rice to Yongbo and stores moved slightly, but the demand was tight. At present, the price of the specially top-grade rice is only 12 yuan. According to the news from the inland areas, the market situation of Yang Du rice and Jian rice is gradually becoming firm. Although sales in Shanghai are not developing, the overall trend is not easy to fall too much, and the price of top-grade Du rice and Jian rice is still just over 12 yuan. The price of Tong Bian in the market is extremely desolate and very quiet. The source of Yin Hua is relatively tight. The markets are different, and there is not much fluctuation in the market.</p>
<h3>Customer Yuan Sales in North China Very Good</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market situation for Ke Xian rice remained stable. Small batches of goods arrived one after another. The sales in the market were slightly better yesterday. The wholesale price of Jiangxi Ji Zao rice was 10 yuan and 0.27 to 10 yuan and 0.05 for 500 bags. The price of Nanjing brown rice was 8 yuan and 0.09 to 8 yuan and 0.064 for 400 bags. The price of Jiangxi Ji Yuan was 14 yuan and 0.025 to 14 yuan and 0.005 for 510 bags. Gan Yuan was all handled by the Beiyang merchant guild. Ji Zao was divided by the street and the Xiamen merchant guild. Brown rice was also handled by the street. Because both customers have marketing appetite, the market situation seems to be looking good, but they are all eating prices very tightly, and the market has still not turned better.</p>
<h3>Flour Market is Firm in the Near Term, Sluggish in the Far Term</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday morning and afternoon, the market in each month was in a state of hovering, showing a slight trend of being firm in the near term and soft in the far term. Although this month is close to settlement, the spot goods of major manufacturers have not been surging, so the amount of settlement in the future may be few. This is the reason for the stability of the market situation. As for the futures months, although the quotations of foreign wheat, Chicago and Canada, fluctuate by one or two jiao each, the purchase sentiment is very quiet, and people's hearts are turning lazy. Seeing this situation, because the manufacturer's selling is less, this market situation will have to stop for the time being. As a result, this month was 0.075 better than the previous day, December was 0.025 better, January/February was down 0.05, March was down 0.025, and April was down 0.075.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Desolate</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market after the opening of each month in the morning and afternoon, the market situation of each month generally tended to stagnate. Because the quotations of foreign wheat each had different price changes, the transactions of each month had turned cold, and the market had also lacked changes. Looking at this situation, if there is no dramatic change in foreign wheat, the standard market situation from now on may come to an end. As a result, December was 0.02 better than the previous day, January/February was unchanged, March was down 0.01, and April was unchanged. The market for spot wheat is that foreign wheat is imported step by step, and the manufacturers' appetite for intake is very lazy, so the whole city has no trading, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Crude and White Sugar Falls, then Rebounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegram, the price of Cuban spot sugar was 1.40625, down 0.03125 from the previous telegram. The price of New York futures sugar in December was 1.29, down 0.01, the price in March next year was 1.42, the price in May was 1.50, and the price in September was 1.63, all down 0.03. The price of Java spot sugar was 7.875, and the prices of futures sugar in December and January were both 7.875, without any increase or decrease compared to the previous. The wholesale of crude and white sugar from the Association was quite surging, and the purchasing sentiment was also active. The transaction price was 7 taels and 4 qian and a half, and the price of high-quality goods was 7 taels and 4 qian and 7.5, and the price of goods that will arrive tomorrow and the day after tomorrow was 7 taels and 4 qian, and the transactions were quite high. The price of ground fine white sugar was 7 taels and 5 qian and a half, and the price of No. 20 medium white sugar was 6 taels and 6 qian and 7.5, and the purchase and sale were slightly lax. The transaction of Dongtang also became active. The price of N-marked goods was 7 taels and 6 qian and a half, the price of YP-marked goods was 7 taels and 8 qian and 0.025, the price of Meiji goods was 7 taels and 8 qian and 7.5, the price of YPO-marked goods was 6 taels and 9 qian, the price of Minghua goods was 7 taels and the price of TM-marked goods was 7 taels and 0.025, and the price of YT-marked goods was 7 taels and 4 qian and 7.5, all of which were steady and beautiful. The Xiuxiu brand opened a spot of 1,000 bags of crude white sand, and the price was 7 taels and 4 qian and a half, and the market was still strong and then sold through. This factory’s ice made by the Shanghai factory opened down 1 qian, and the products of the Nanyang and Zhonghua factories will also see a fall today. The price of Zhongzi ice was 10 taels and 7 qian, and the price of Huazi was 10 taels and 6 qian, and the sales were still active.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Anhui Autumn Cocoon Price Difficult to Rise</h3>
<p>The silk mills in Shanghai have resumed work with some effort because they followed the advice of the government, but there are no raw materials, and all the dry cocoons mortgaged to the banks are wary of delivering them to the factories for silk reeling because of the concern of labor unrest. Therefore, the silk mills that have started work have to purchase raw materials in the market, but the silk market is not prosperous, and the price of cocoons is still difficult to rise. Yesterday, a factory in Zhabei entered 350 dan of Anhui autumn cocoons, 740 jin of silk reeling discount, the price was only 79 taels, and the net pull of silk capital had to be nearly 600 taels, plus the silk reeling labor, the factory still had to lose dozens of taels.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Continues to Be Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Zhenmei green tea on both the road and soil routes still had no large-scale sales. Most of the telegrams sent last week had no response. Gongxi green tea, Russian bank also changed to be light. In recent days, there have been many weighings, but the Russian Aid Association is extremely harsh on tea prices, and the deduction of sample debts is too large, which is quite dissatisfied with Chinese tea merchants. In addition, Qi Ning black tea, British and Russian banks are also waiting and seeing, and the market situation is very desolate.</p>
<h3>Broadcloth and Woolen Fabric Inland Merchant Transactions Are Booming</h3>
<p>Broadcloth and woolen goods have been selling very widely recently, and the transactions of small merchants in the inland areas such as the capital, Wuhu, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, and Ningbo are the most prosperous. There are several cases of shop owners personally visiting Shanghai to select and match goods and quick letters requesting purchases every day, such as felt cloth, six-foot velvet overcoat cloth, velvet cloth, Huate cloth, and printed cloth, all of which are needed. Most of them are trading in cash. It is a pity that except for the overcoat cloth, there is no original box taste for the other items. The national New Year is approaching, and most people dare not enter too much again, but although it is a business of splitting and cutting pieces, the bustling and busy scene is not what it used to be.</p>
<h3>Oil Market Asphalt Market is Beautiful</h3>
<p>New Sesame City Goods Have Not Been Marketed Yet... Sichuan Occupies the Han Market with Tight Supplies</p>
<p>The asphalt market is still firm. The selling price of Famous Heavy Branch has reached 18 taels. The asphalt production area in Tibet is adjacent to Hanzhong. In the past, new oil could arrive one after another at this time. This year, because the bandit situation is very fierce, the merchants in the production area have mostly moved away, so the new goods have not yet appeared on the market. In recent years, the foreign sales of asphalt have declined daily, and the demand for soap factories in domestic sales has increased sharply. The situation is in opposition. However, domestic sales transactions are not as constant as foreign companies, so the market is still flat.</p>
<p>Sichuan's occupation of transactions is still smooth, and Guangbang continues to negotiate. The market still requires 110 taels. Zheng Mi in the Han market is sold to 123 taels to 119 taels. Qing Shen Yong brand is 105 taels to 03 taels.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Banking Community's Announcement Regarding the Reorganization of Domestic Debt Yesterday</h3>
<p>Representatives of the Tianjin banking community have been determined.</p>
<p>A creditor group can be established within ten days.</p>
<p>The Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin banking communities initiated the organization of a Chinese domestic debt creditor group to register group accounts and request reorganization. According to yesterday's news, in addition to the representatives of the Shanghai and Beiping banking communities' creditor groups, the Tianjin banking community also telegraphed back to the local banking association yesterday, saying that Sun Zhongshan, the manager of Tianjin Dazhong Bank, Ding Wenchao, the manager of Huiye Bank, and Zhu Yusheng, the manager of Yanye Bank, have been determined as representatives, and they will leave for Shanghai immediately to participate. The representatives of Beijing and Tianjin are expected to arrive in Shanghai within a week. After the representatives of Beijing and Tianjin arrive in Shanghai, the representatives in Shanghai will first have an informal agreement, and then officially meet to establish a creditor group of the banking sector. Matters such as the registration and detailed investigation of creditors nationwide, the names and amount statistics of various new and old domestic debts, and the reorganization plan will also be discussed at this meeting. Because the majority of the debt amount of the national new and old domestic debts is owed, the creditor group must be initiated first to obtain a thorough reorganization.</p>
<h3>Leftover News from the Support Xiao and Anti-Dutch Conference</h3>
<p>The Diplomatic Support Association will convene soon.</p>
<p>The situation of the public support Xiao and anti-Dutch conference held by all sectors at the City Chamber of Commerce the day before yesterday has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper, but because the meeting was adjourned too late, the details of the meeting were not covered by various newspapers, so the leftover news is added as follows.</p>
<p>Worker donations. At the end of the meeting, Chairman Xu Jigong reported to the public that the Greater China Record Company donated 100 yuan for the conference and the Diplomatic Support Association. The crowd applauded greatly. It is heard that the company was founded by overseas Chinese, so its workers are particularly familiar.</p>
<p>The representative is determined to petition. The representative, Xu Jigong and other five people, were publicly recommended by the public, and it was agreed to set off that night to rush to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to urge the issuance of electricity to the Dutch side as soon as possible to abolish the unequal "Sino-Dutch Consular Treaty" and negotiate the correction of the unequal regulations in the Dutch Charter that "Chinese are assimilated to the natives" and cancel the Dutch Parliament's resolution on increasing the entry tax for overseas Chinese to 150 guilders per person and the pier tax for continued residence of Chinese workers to 75 guilders per person. If the goal is not achieved, they will not leave the Ministry.</p>
<p>The Support Association. The name and brief of this association have been discussed for a long time. Finally, it was decided that all the 21 groups that initiated the convocation, such as the Overseas Chinese Federation, would be ex officio members, and all the groups that attended the meeting that day would join the organization, and the Overseas Chinese Federation would be publicly recommended to convene the first meeting.</p>
<p>Continue to send telegrams. (1) "Telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, please seriously negotiate the case according to the main points decided by the conference, and ask to replace the stubborn and shameless Consul General Zhang." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jun Jian, our country's female teacher Xiao Xin'an was brutally raped by the Dutch second mate of the Zhawagongsi轮船芝巴德号 in turn. Anyone with blood could not help but feel indignant. Therefore, on the 26th of this month, all sectors of Shanghai were convened at the Chamber of Commerce in this city to publicly support Xiao and oppose the Dutch conference. More than 100 groups and thousands of representatives arrived and immediately discussed and decided on several minimum requirements for the Xiao case, (1) The Dutch government must formally apologize to our government and guarantee that the same facts will never happen again in the future, (2) Zhawagongsi must publish in all Chinese and Western newspapers in all places where overseas Chinese reside, apologize to our entire nation and Ms. Xiao, and guarantee that the same facts will never happen again in the future, (3) Severely punish the Dutch first mate Lan Anqi and the second mate Lei Dima Kai, who took turns raping on the Zhawagongsi轮船芝巴德号, and must not only be dismissed or demoted, (4) Permanently remove the shipowner of the Zhawagongsi输船亚尔氏 and the ship doctor 白林古, who were in the same evil, and must not only be demoted, (5) Zhawagongsi will compensate Ms. Xiao Xin'an for the loss of 100,000 taels. We sincerely request that the Ministry obey public opinion and seriously negotiate. If the Dutch side does not accommodate, our country's boycott of Dutch ships and all anti-Dutch movements will never stop. Recently, I heard that Consul General Zhang in Java telegraphed the Ministry, saying that the Zhawagongsi in Batavia claimed that the first mate and second mate had been demoted and were being tried by the court, and asked the Xiamen and Shanghai municipal governments to stop the boycott, etc. If the Consul General really had this telegram, he was insane. Whether Ms. Xiao is a member of our nation, despising and raping Ms. Xiao is equivalent to despising and raping our entire nation. Even if the Consul General privately and forcibly expelled Ms. Xiao from the Chinese nation, even if only a personal rape lawsuit would never be settled by demotion. May I ask Consul General Zhang, if overseas Chinese rape Dutch women, can the Consul General guarantee that overseas Chinese will not be subject to other penalties besides being demoted? As for the court trial, it is only a perfunctory means. There is absolutely no value for consideration before the sentence is imposed. The Consul General dared to speak for the enemy without arguing according to reason. Please ask the Ministry to immediately remove the Consul General to show the determination to love the country and overseas Chinese and to warn the stubborn and shameless people. A telegram of grief and indignation is sent, and the clear order is expected. The Support Xiao and Anti-Dutch Conference of all sectors in Shanghai bows down. (2) "Telegram to the Fujian Provincial Government, please stop the Xiamen authorities (banning the boycott of Zhawa ships) from issuing chaotic orders." The Fujian Provincial Government, Jun Jian, our country's female teacher Xiao Xin'an was brutally raped by the Dutch second mate of the Zhawagongsi轮船芝巴德号, and the whole world was indignant. In addition, the Dutch government has massacred tens of thousands of our compatriots over the years, imprisoned and expelled countless party reporters and teachers, and levied tens of millions of yuan in head tax and wartime income tax on our people. In its governing Dutch charter, it publicly stipulates that Chinese people are an inferior nation and are in the same category as the natives, which is even more unbearable. Therefore, the whole country has risen up and unanimously boycotted Zhawa ships as a diplomatic backing. The Xiamen Support Xiao Case Committee has organized a patrol team to boycott Dutch ships, which is enough to represent the public opinion of the whole body. The Xiamen Garrison Command and the Siming County Government, under the movement of Zhawagongsi, dared to be flattering to foreigners and excluding Chinese people, and deceivingly requested a ban, which is a public enemy of the people. The general manager of Zhawagongsi in Shanghai, at the beginning of advocating the boycott in our port, immediately sent a representative, Qian Chongfu, to apologize to the Overseas Chinese Federation, willing to publish in the name of Zhawagongsi in Chinese and Western newspapers in all places where overseas Chinese reside, apologize to the entire Chinese nation and Ms. Xiao, and guarantee that the same facts will never happen again in the future. The Overseas Chinese Federation considers the anti-Dutch movement to be a public affair of the whole of China, not a private matter of a single entity, and any institution or entity shall not privately settle with the enemy, and those who violate it will be traitors, so it firmly rejected it. The manager could not sell it in Shanghai and turned to Xiamen. Unexpectedly, the Xiamen authorities regarded the Dutch as the Emperor of Heaven, and considered it an honor to be soft-spoken and be directed by them and suppressed our people. This is really intolerable by heaven and earth and angered by gods and people. If your government does not quickly stop it, it will also be blamed for it. The people are like water, and water can carry a boat and overturn it. The commander and county magistrate deserve to suffer, but it is regrettable that your government is groundlessly accused. Gentlemen love people with virtue, and our association humbly asks your government for orders with sincerity, and we hope that your government will teach them. The Support Xiao and Anti-Dutch Conference of all sectors in Shanghai bows down.</p>

<h3>Mu Ouchu's Letter Congratulating Zhang Zhijiang</h3>
<p>Mu Ouchu's congratulatory letter to Jiangsu Pacification Governor Zhang Zhijiang said, Brother Zhijiang, Superintendent of Meritorious Deeds, I am honored to be appointed as the Superintendent of Patrol and to establish a tooth in Weiyang, controlling the land and water. In this country of turmoil, there is a worry that it is difficult to change the disease. Brother Su, I am also a Su person. If the Su bandits are not cleared, the people's livelihood will be in vain.

Creating achievements in the homeland, I also bow to the grace of the skin. From then on, the river is clear and the sea is calm, and the whole 閶兴 sings the song of five trousers. The prosperity of commerce and the benefit of workers will be a thousand years of wisdom. Special Xiao congratulatory message, only wishing you a safe life, Brother Mu Xiangyue, November 26.</p>
<h3>Belgian Consulate Celebrates National Day Yesterday</h3>

Wang invited the diplomatic missions and consular corps in Shanghai and the leaders of local agencies to attend, and prepared champagne and refreshments for the guests.

<h3>American Overseas Celebrates Thanksgiving Day Yesterday</h3>
<p>Pray and have a feast</p>
<p>Yesterday was the American Thanksgiving Day, which is to celebrate the harvest and thank God for the abundance of the five grains, just like the ancient Chinese La sacrifice. Since 1621, the United States has stipulated it as a law and has been following it every year. Every year in late November, the President chooses a Thursday to hold it, and prepares a prayer text to be promulgated throughout the country. At that time, the officials will read it respectfully to show their piety. The American overseas and soldiers and students in this port also gathered at the Grand Chapel of Sanma Road at 11:00 a.m. to make a grand prayer. The American Consul General, Qin Jintu, read the President's blessing. In the evening, every family held a celebration banquet, and the Marine Corps and warships were also given a day off to set up a feast. Items such as turkey and American fruits were essential items on the table that day.</p>
<h3>Chen Mingshu Meets with Representatives of the Industrial Association</h3>
<p>Zhong Lingjun, a student studying in France, usually pays attention to craftsmanship and has no contact with comrades in France. In order to avoid losing the research, the Republic of China</p>

<p>In the fourteenth year (of the Republic, i.e., 1925), the Society of Arts and Crafts Research was established in Paris. At that time, Gao Muhong, Xu Kuangwu, Zhong Yu, and others jointly organized dozens of Chinese students studying arts and crafts in France to join, researching together as a group. After returning to China, they dispersed to various places, maintaining infrequent communication. Zhong Ling and others believed that it was necessary to establish the Society in Shanghai. In October of this year, they sent circulars to former members, convening a general meeting at No. 44 Huang Lu Road, dedicated to studying the needs of Chinese industry and encouraging each other. On the 27th of this month, Chairman Chen Mingshu of the Guangdong Provincial Government arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing. The Society members, having always admired Chairman Chen's respect for industry, sent representatives Zhong Nan, Gao Muhong, Xu Kuangwu, and Zhong Yu to pay their respects and offer many contributions regarding the future of Chinese industry. Chairman Chen expressed great sympathy for the Society representatives and promised appropriate assistance in the future. The representatives were overjoyed and requested a group photograph to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<h3>Mr. Ohtani Flew to Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Four Organizations Scheduled a Banquet</p>
<p>Mr. Raizo Ohtani, head of Da Lai (Ohtani Kisen Co.), came to Shanghai from the United States this time to develop Far East shipping and to inaugurate new routes to the inner parts of Luzon, and he attended the inaugural ceremony. He once told people that Pacific shipping this year has reached a situation of too many ships and not enough cargo, resulting in overcapacity. The shipment of goods from China to the United States is particularly sluggish. Ohtani Kisen has a total of seventeen ships traveling between China and the United States. In this period of shipping decline, it is necessary to find ways to remedy the situation. In addition to the two giant ships being built for the Sino-American line, which will be launched next month and in January of next year, there are currently few excellent passenger ships sailing in the inner parts of Luzon. The company has specially built a new passenger ship at a cost of 4 million pesos, dedicated to operating between the islands of Manila. It was launched this month and will be sufficient in future business to compensate for the inadequacy of the Sino-American line. The war in China has ended, and construction is just beginning. In the future, trade between the two countries will surely flourish, and Sino-American shipping will soon be able to recover. After returning to Shanghai from Luzon via Guangzhou, Mr. Ohtani felt slightly unwell due to exposure to the elements, but he recovered yesterday. Since he must return to the United States via the Pacific next week, he took advantage of his remaining free time to go to the capital. This trip is to meet with important officials of the National Government. He originally planned to go to Nanjing by train, but because it would take longer, he went to Hongqiao Airport yesterday morning with Mr. Steding, the Shanghai manager, and Secretary Gibson, and flew to Nanjing together. He will visit President Chiang Kai-shek and will have to return to Shanghai in about one or two days.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Banking Association, the Money Trade Association, and the Shipping Association have specifically scheduled a banquet for Mr. Ohtani on the second of next month to strengthen their friendship. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has already sent out invitations, inviting leaders of the city's industry and commerce to attend.</p>
<h3>Various Organizations Prepare to Welcome British Economic Mission</h3>

<h3>Process of Allocating and Handling Public Security Funds in Shanghai County</h3>
<p>Magistrate Yan reported at the county administration meeting the other day that the Shanghai County public security funds were cut off by the municipal government in June of last year, leaving no source of income. As of January 15 of this year, salaries were paid by submitting a request to the Department of Finance for appropriation, with the arrears of land tax from the 16th year (of the Republic, i.e., 1927) being the main source, and with the approval of borrowing from each district to cover one month's salaries for each branch bureau. The rest was made up by former Magistrate Lu by exhausting all county taxes. At this point, all resources were exhausted, and there was nothing left to borrow. During the tenure of former Magistrate Leng, he continued to request the Department of Finance to allocate 2,000 yuan, and the Property Management Office borrowed 2,000 yuan from the money shops on behalf of the county. Apart from these, the remaining revenue from house taxes and fines for violating regulations, which had always been reserved for clothing expenses, were all diverted to subsidize the food expenses of the police force. Otherwise, there were only arrears, and large debts were owed to each district for rice and temporary loans. In May of this year, the current magistrate again requested the Department of Finance to allocate 2,000 yuan, which was only enough to temporarily maintain the food expenses of the police force. However, the accumulated arrears of salaries were already more than three months. Considering that the lack of funds would undermine public security and affect all facilities, he was deeply worried and sought a solution. After careful consideration of the situation and reviewing the documents, he repeatedly submitted requests to the provincial and municipal authorities for approval and guidance. On the one hand, he settled the accounts with the municipal government for allocation, and on the other hand, he consulted with the municipal government to allocate the county public security funds first. After repeatedly traveling to the province and city, he explained the situation in detail in person. Finally, in June, the municipal government agreed to allocate half of the funds on a monthly basis. However, the monthly expenditure was still far from sufficient. Therefore, he had to temporarily plan for a reduction in staff and provide reduced salaries to maintain operations. However, the previous accumulated debt of more than ten thousand</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>several thousand yuan remained unsettled. During the staff reduction, the arrears of salaries were even more urgent to be paid. In desperation, he again appealed to the provincial authorities to consider the difficult situation and allocate funds to pay the arrears. Recently, approval was granted to allocate 5,000 yuan, but the fundamental solution still depends on the settlement of accounts between the province and the city. This is a summary of the difficult financial situation of the public security funds over the past year and a half. Now, I will separately explain the main points of planning for the allocation of the 5,000 yuan allocated by the province to pay various arrears and related matters, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) General Overview of Arrears (as of November): (1) Total arrears of salaries and wages for public security from January 16 to the end of June: 11,594.342 yuan. According to the above calculation of five and a half months, the monthly expenditure is 3,921.315 yuan, totaling 21,567.15 yuan. The following has been allocated and paid: The Department of Finance allocated funds in advance, totaling 40 yuan. The Property Management Office borrowed 2,000 yuan on behalf of the county. The Municipal Finance Bureau allocated half of the June funds, totaling 1,960.65 yuan. House taxes from each district from January to June totaled 967.15 yuan. 1,028 yuan was diverted from the fines from February to June. The Finance Bureau overspent by 17.008 yuan. The total amount allocated and paid is 9,972.808 yuan. After deducting the amount already allocated and paid, the remaining arrears are as stated above. (2) Advances: Approximately 1,259.578 yuan. According to the above calculation, 1. Balance of summer clothing: 209.12 yuan; 2. Spring clothing, etc.: 288 yuan; 3. Travel expenses for police cadets: 53.47 yuan; 4. Salaries for the remaining police officers for five days in July: 108.988 yuan; 5. Shortfall after staff reduction until this month: approximately 600 yuan. The total is as stated above (Item 2 has not yet been submitted for approval). Item 5 is an estimated amount reported by the Public Security Bureau. (3) Diverted Fines for Violations: Approximately 2,000 yuan. According to the above, the actual revenue from January to June was 1,028 yuan. The actual revenue from July to November has not yet been fully reported. Based on previous estimates, the total is as stated above. The substantial expenses required for clothing in the autumn and winter seasons will be paid from this fund. (4) 2,000 yuan borrowed on behalf of the county by the Property Management Office. (5) 2,288 yuan borrowed from each district in the previous year to cover the expenses of each branch bureau in October. The total of the above arrears is 17,510.386 yuan. This is an approximate amount obtained from reviewing the case files. There are some discrepancies between the amounts allocated by the Public Security Bureau and the former Finance Bureau, which need to be investigated.</p>
<p>(2) Method of Allocation: Except for the expenses borrowed from each district in the previous year to cover the salaries of each branch bureau in October and the loan borrowed on behalf of the county by the Property Management Office, these will be temporarily postponed because the amount allocated this time is too small. 1,500 yuan will be used for the clothing expenses for the autumn and winter seasons, and 3,500 yuan will be used to pay the arrears. 20% of the advances will be paid, the salary for the remaining police officers for five days will be fully paid, and 20% of the remaining advances will also be paid. The arrears of salaries for the branch bureaus in each county will be paid on average by approximately 30%, detailed as follows: A. Portion for Paying Arrears: Total 3,500 yuan. 1. 20% of the advances to Zhu: 144 yuan; 2. Full payment of salaries for the remaining police officers for five days: 108.988 yuan; 3. 20% of other advances: 230.118 yuan; 4. Total payment of arrears to county branch bureaus: 3,027.894 yuan. It should be further stipulated in the above fourth item: (1) 50% of the Zhu advances should be paid, totaling 1,170 yuan; (2) 50% of the temporary loans from each district should be paid, totaling 279 yuan. The remaining 1,538.894 yuan will be received by the bureau and allocated to the county branch bureaus for the payment of police salaries, prioritizing the most urgent needs. B. Portion for Clothing: Total 1,500 yuan. The above is the return of the fines for violations. Because the amount received this time is not large, it cannot be fully returned. Only the clothing needs are met first as stated above. Regarding the above allocation, it needs to be explained that it is difficult to fully repay the loan borrowed on behalf of the county by the Property Management Office. If it is repaid on a pro rata basis, it is also not feasible, so it is planned to postpone it temporarily. The unpaid rice payments from each district are due to the arrearage of salaries. Therefore, more arrearage payments must be made. On the one hand, the hardships of the merchants are also taken into account, reducing the responsibility of each district to bear the burden. Therefore, 50% is paid. Also, because the loans borrowed by each district in the previous year are difficult to repay at this time, 50% of the remaining temporary loans are also paid. However, the listed amounts are based on the reports from the Public Security Bureau. If there are increases or decreases, the allocation should be made according to these figures to avoid repeated allocations and further difficulties. 3. Key Points of Government Planning and Handling: For the past year and a half, the funds have been stopped by the municipal government, and there has been no source of funds. The situation is critical, and the impact on governance is self-evident. Forced by the circumstances, planning and handling have been extremely difficult. In order to maintain the status quo, the government decided to implement staff reductions as soon as the municipal government agreed to allocate half of the funds first. Although it is inevitable to be constrained and simplified, the aim is to avoid the receipt of funds without actual revenue. All personnel serving in public security can work with peace of mind and prevent the arrears of salaries from increasing. This is one aspect. Although there are many accumulated arrears from the past, the provincial government allocated 5,000 yuan during the provincial treasury's difficult times, which is not a small amount. In the past, there was no source of funds, and even maintaining food expenses was difficult. It was out of the question to clear the accumulated arrears. Although the regular expenses are still insufficient, they have been received on a monthly basis. The province has also allocated funds to pay the arrears, so it is necessary to plan comprehensively and allocate them according to the urgency and importance of each item, bringing it to a conclusion. From now on, unless the provincial and municipal authorities settle the allocation and the municipal government allocates the arrears, it will be difficult to raise a large amount of money again in the short term. Therefore, the procedures that have not been cleared for more than a year should be sorted out at this time to avoid making it more difficult to clear them later and to prevent being disturbed by the arrears of salaries in the future, so that they can focus on their duties. This is another aspect. Even after the staff reduction, there is still a monthly shortfall, which means there are still monthly arrears. Fortunately, it has not been long and the amount is not large. This situation should be rectified immediately by tightening the budget again with the funds allocated by the municipal government and the revenue from house taxes, and by reorganizing the budget. The fines must be deposited into the Finance Bureau on a monthly basis according to the regulations, to be used as temporary and clothing expenses. It is hoped that the budget will be appropriate and orderly, waiting for the municipal funds to be allocated according to regulations before restoring the original situation. This is yet another aspect. In short, the difficulties the government has faced in the past with the public security funding issue, the pain experienced by the public security personnel, the difficulties and burdens on all related parties, and the resulting reduction in the efficiency of public security administration, are all evidenced by many facts. If we do not address this now, we will be derelict in our duties. Therefore, after the preliminary plan has been determined, I am presenting this report with the hope that we can all understand the spirit of this and work together towards it.</p>
<h3>Savings of Dredging Bureau Transferred to National Bank</h3>
<p>Since the founding of the Republic, the dredging expenses of the Dredging Bureau have been funded by the three percent dredging tax collected by the Customs. In recent years, due to the sharp increase in customs duties, the dredging tax has also become abundant. After deducting expenses, the accumulated savings over the years amount to over one million taels. In the past, these funds were placed in fixed-term and current accounts at banks such as HSBC, Mercantile Bank, and British Bank. Since Director Song Ziliang took office, he has found that the bureau's remaining funds are all deposited in foreign banks, which is a loss of national rights. It is heard that he has proposed at the bureau's administrative meeting that since the bureau is a national river dredging agency, all remaining funds should be deposited in a national bank. It has been resolved that the current account savings have already been transferred to the Central Bank for expenses, and that the remaining fixed-term deposits will be transferred to a national bank as soon as they mature.</p>
<h3>Various Public Organizations in Baoshan County Telegraph Request to Be Exempted from Construction Bonds</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Province has recently issued construction bonds worth 7 million yuan, with the first tranche of 4 million yuan being issued first. It was previously resolved at the provincial government meeting that each county would be allocated a quota to purchase. Baoshan County's quota is 50,000 yuan. It is now known that the various public organizations in the county believe that the years have been lean and the people's resources are truly insufficient. The Public Funds and Property Management Office and various district offices have jointly telegraphed the provincial authorities, requesting exemption from the allocation. The text of the telegram is recorded below: To Ye, Chairman of the Zhenjiang Provincial Government; Sun, Director of the Department of Construction; Chen, Director of the Department of Finance; and Qiu, Magistrate of this county: It has been reported that Jiangsu Province is issuing construction bonds and Baoshan County has been allocated 50,000 yuan to purchase. This county is barren and the people are poor. The financial resources are exhausted. Since the separation of the city and county, the area has been reduced, making it even more difficult. In addition, the autumn harvest has been poor, and the households have little savings. We have already requested a reduction in taxes and truly have no surplus to purchase the bonds. We humbly request that you consider the special circumstances of this county and exempt it from the allocation to alleviate the people's hardship. We are waiting for your orders with utmost respect. Respectfully, Gu Hongchuan, Director of the Public Funds and Property Management Office of Baoshan County; and Lu Fengpu, Wang Qingtao, Yang Weixiong, Shen Buyin, Yan Guangen, etc., district chiefs of various districts.</p>
<h3>Two Railway Bureaus Cancel Rice Subsidies</h3>
<p>Previously, due to the soaring rice prices, low-paid employees of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways requested the railway bureaus to provide subsidies to help them. The Ministry of Railways approved that those with a monthly salary of more than 30 yuan would receive a rice subsidy of 1.5 yuan, and those with a monthly salary of less than 50 yuan would receive a rice subsidy of 1 yuan. It is now known that the subsidies have been cancelled because the rice prices have now become more stable and the postal service has already implemented the cancellation. Therefore, the railway bureaus have also issued a notice to all departments on the other day that the rice subsidies will be cancelled from December.</p>
<h3>Wusong Camp Area Under the Jurisdiction of the Fortress</h3>
<p>Military Affairs Ministry's Instruction to Commander Deng</p>
<p>The Wusong Fortress area has a wide camp area, but due to its long history, it is impossible to ascertain the exact number of land acres. As a result, many of them have been occupied by residents as their own. The Ministry of Military Affairs specially sent Hu Qin from the Camp Property Investigation Office to Wusong for an on-site inspection. The inspection has now been completed, and a total of 417 cases have been found, which will be taken back and leased out by the Wusong Fortress to restore property rights. In addition, the old Prince's Mansion in the fortress area was originally built during the late Qing Dynasty and was prepared as a review station for the princes. It was burned down during the Qi-Lu war, leaving only the empty frame. Also, several old barracks such as the Lion Forest have been more than half collapsed. No one has been assigned to manage them, and they have been taken by nearby vagrants, which is not in line with the intention of preserving public property. The Ministry of Military Affairs has instructed the Wusong Fortress Commander to assign personnel nearby to protect the property and emphasize public property. It has also formulated measures for the leasing of camp properties in the Wusong Fortress and ordered Commander Deng to comply. Commander Deng issued an announcement on the other day and put the measures into effect.</p>

<h3>Yangtze River Water Levels Rise and Freight Rates Increase</h3>
<p>50% Increase Above Wuhu</p>
<p>50% Increase Above Hankou</p>
<p>Six companies including Shanghai's Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Nisshin, China Merchants, and San Peh held a meeting yesterday. Due to the daily decrease in river water levels, making navigation difficult and requiring more fuel, they resolved to increase shallow water freight rates. It was agreed at the time that, except for areas below Wuhu where the river is not yet shallow, other ports such as Jiujiang and Hankou would increase export freight rates by 15% of the original price starting from December 1. It was also decided that ports above Hankou, such as Shashi and Yichang, where the water levels are even shallower, would increase freight rates by 50% starting from the first of the month. Notice has already been given to all customers for implementation on schedule. In addition, the shipping companies in North China have also agreed to increase the export freight rates by 10% across the board starting from December 1.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ships Expand Shipping Industry to China</h3>
<p>Dalian, Guangzhou and Guangdong Lines: Japanese Dalian Steamship Company has been making steady progress in its shipping business to China in recent years. It has added three ships, Fengtian, Changchun, and Dalian, to the Shanghai-Dalian line, and has also opened a special passenger line between Shanghai and Tianjin. In the spring and summer of this year, it built four more cargo ships of 3,500 tons each, namely Kunshan Maru, Qianshan Maru, and Yushan Maru, to operate between Yingkou and Shanghai. Currently, the company is further expanding its operations and has decided to add ships to compete in the Yangtze River shipping industry in China. As for Guangzhou, Xiamen, and Shantou in South China, where the company has no routes, it has also decided to open them at the same time. It will first send two ships to the Yangtze River line and two ships to the Guangzhou line. The company has also commissioned Mitsubishi Shipyard to build four new ships of 4,500 tons each for the development of the Yangtze River and South China shipping business.</p>
<p>Yamashita Expands India-America Line: The Yamashita Company has always had foreign triangular routes, namely those operating to India, North America, and Australia. Recently, due to the sluggish shipping business in the near seas, it has shifted its focus to the ocean. It is heard that it has decided to increase new ships for the India-America lines in the triangular routes in order to compete with various companies for the transportation of timber, cotton, Indian hemp, etc., to the Far East. It is already in the planning stage and will be launched next month.</p>
<p>Kawasaki Opens China-Korea Line: Kawasaki Kisen Co. opened the Yangtze River route and Wenzhou line in Shanghai earlier this year, and then opened the North China route.

<h3>Northwest Districts' Silk Factory Women Workers Continue to Demand Equal Pay for Men and Women</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Plans to Convene Mediation Talks</p>
<p>The Eastern District Labor Union Issues a Notice to Comply with Labor-Management Terms</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Silk Factory strike was mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau, a total of forty-two silk factories have reopened, and most male and female workers are able to work with peace of mind. However, the female workers are dissatisfied with the post-mediation wage cuts, believing that they are not being treated equally with male workers. The female workers of the Eastern District Labor Union took the lead in submitting a petition to the Social Affairs Bureau with certain demands. At that time, the authorities instructed the female workers' representatives to negotiate with the factory management themselves. It is said that the factory management did not agree. Yesterday, the female workers' labor unions in the Northwest districts also submitted the same request to the Social Affairs Bureau. It is said that the Social Affairs Bureau also plans to convene mediation talks at a later date. In other news, the Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Shanghai Eastern District Labor Union Council issued a notice yesterday to its affiliated labor unions regarding the announcement of the Social Affairs Bureau's order No. 4062, which states that the wage reduction dispute in the silk factory industry has been resolved through the Bureau convening representatives from both labor and management to reach an agreement. In addition to instructing the Silk Factory Trade Association and issuing a copy of the settlement record to the relevant parties, it is also instructed to forward it to all workers to comply with. Due to this order, the six articles of the settlement record are listed below for all branch members to be aware of. The union also believes that the silk industry is in decline, and it is implementing painful wage cuts in the hope of labor-management cooperation. It is hoped that members of each factory will not neglect their duties due to the small wage cuts. This announcement must not be violated: (1) The wages of all silk factory workers in Shanghai shall be temporarily calculated at 85% of the original amount across all factories. (2) The silkworm moth subsidy that workers are entitled to shall still be issued at 45% of the original salary. (3) The wage increases and other benefits that workers are entitled to shall remain the same as before. (4) When the factory's business improves, the labor side may request the restoration of the original wages, but the wage reduction period will last until the end of May next year. (5) The treatment of workers in double cocoon factories is different from that in single cocoon factories, and any changes must be submitted to the government for approval. (6) This agreement shall take effect from November 1st.</p>
<h3>Goldsmiths' Outworkers Demand Improved Treatment</h3>
<p>Mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau Fails</p>
<p>The Labor Side Has Applied for Arbitration</p>
<p>The goldsmiths' outworkers in this city demanded that the employers improve their treatment. The executive committee of the labor union passed thirteen conditions and submitted them to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation after being reviewed and approved by the Citizens' Training Association. The most important of these was the second condition, which stipulated that the wage rate for contract workers should be increased by 36% plus 30% of the employers' price list. The third condition stipulated that the wages of long-term workers should be increased by 30% of the original wages. The tenth condition stipulated that all tools used by the workers should be purchased by the employers. The twelfth condition stipulated that the meal allowance for contract workers should be six yuan per month. The Social Affairs Bureau convened several meetings, but the mediation could not proceed because both parties insisted on their positions. It was concluded that the mediation had failed. Later, the labor union sent representatives to negotiate with the employers, but to no avail. Therefore, yesterday, they submitted a petition to the Social Affairs Bureau to be forwarded to the Municipal Government, requesting arbitration.</p>

The deadline has now passed, and countless people have not renewed their licenses due to the impact of the war. It was proposed that the government extend the deadline. It was resolved to pass the original proposal and request the government to implement it. Various important cases were then discussed, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3>Three Robbers Shot Dead on the Spot During a Robbery in Zhoujiazui Road</h3>
<p>Six Robbers Commit Robbery, Three Dead, Two Injured</p>
<p>Bullets Fly, Detective Injured</p>
<p>Stray Bullets Injure a Woman and a Child</p>
<p>The Qian family at No. 375 Fuxing Lane, Zhoujiazui Road, was suddenly robbed yesterday morning at around 9:00 a.m. After receiving the news, the Harbin Road Police Station immediately dispatched armed Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene to surround and arrest the robbers. At that time, four robbers had already fled to the road and opened fire to resist arrest. The detectives returned fire, and the two sides exchanged more than forty shots. As a result, three robbers were shot dead on the spot. One foreign detective and one Chinese detective from the police station were injured, and two passers-by were also injured by stray bullets. Fortunately, they were not seriously injured. Afterwards, the detectives arrested two robbers in the house of the victim and took them to the police station for questioning.</p>
<p>Six Robbers Invade and Commit Robbery Qian Zugen, a Ningbo native, also known as Qizhang, jointly invested with others to open the Hecheng Tobacco Company on Oujia Road and served as the accountant. He lived at No. 375 Fuxing Lane, Zhoujiazui Road. Yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m., Qian had left for Ningbo on business. Suddenly, six robbers broke in through the front door. Two robbers stood guard downstairs, and the remaining robbers rushed upstairs. At that time, only Qian's wife, Chen, was in the room. She was shocked to see this situation, but had no way to resist. She had no choice but to let the robbers search and rob her, and the loss was about one hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Detectives Rush to Arrest Robbers Fuxing Lane is a private lane with only two Shikumen gates. Qian's residence is across from his neighbor's, and they can see each other. Therefore, the lane is very quiet. Passers-by did not know that the robbers were committing a robbery inside. Fortunately, two Chinese detectives from the Harbin Road Police Station were patrolling outside Fuxing Lane. Suddenly, they saw a woman running out of the lane and reporting to the police. The two detectives immediately summoned nearby patrol officers. One detective ran to the police booth and reported to the Harbin Road Police Station by telephone. Immediately, many armed Chinese and foreign detectives rushed to Fuxing Lane to arrest the robbers.</p>
<p>Three Robbers Killed on the Spot In an instant, the situation near Fuxing Lane suddenly became serious. Because four robbers had already rushed out of the lane gate and fled before the detectives arrived, they ran and opened fire on the detectives. The Chinese and foreign detectives also returned fire. For a time, gunshots crackled and sounded like a string of pearls. However, the guns fired by the robbers were mostly inaccurate and difficult to dodge. As a result, three robbers were shot in vital parts by the detectives and died on the road one after another. The places where the two robbers fell were not far from Fuxing Lane. One had already turned the corner and fled, but he could not escape death.</p>
<p>Detectives Shot and Injured When detectives and robbers exchanged fire, foreign detective Beinaite was shot in the right arm, and Chinese detective No. 2427 was also slightly injured. After being injured, foreign detective Beinaite was sent to Gongji Hospital for treatment and was not seriously injured. When Beinaite was not injured, he fired three shots and hit a robber. Another foreign detective, Shengtufute, also fired and hit a robber. The rest were shot and killed by Chinese detectives.</p>
<p>Stray Bullets Injure Two People Two people were also injured by stray bullets. One was Zhao Jiaxian, a fifteen-year-old apprentice at Lihua Sewing Company at No. 289 Zhoujiazui Road, a Ningbo native. He heard gunshots and went out through the back door to watch. A bullet flew and hit his left foot. The other was Chen Xia, a twenty-eight-year-old Yangzhou native and housewife of the tiger stove owner at No. 318 on the same road. She was watching idly at the door when a bullet hit her left leg. Both were sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment by a police car and were not seriously injured.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Measures for Self-Defense by Merchants and Residents</h3>
<p>Yuan Liang's Concern for Defense</p>
<p>Yuan Liang, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, pays special attention to winter defense. He has now drafted supplementary measures for self-defense by merchants and residents, which have been distributed to the heads of all districts and then forwarded to commercial organizations for distribution to all residents and businesses in the city. The supplementary measures are listed below: "Supplementary Measures for Self-Defense by Merchants and Residents": (1) In Shanghai, it is customary for residents to enter and exit through the back door. In the morning or evening, maids often leave the door ajar when going out to fetch water or buy groceries, which provides an opportunity for robbers to break in. Once they break in, they close the door, pull out weapons such as pistols, and prevent anyone from making a sound. They can only be allowed to rob and escape with the loot. Only then can the district office be notified, but the robbers have already fled far away. It is best to install foreign locks on the back doors. People leaving the house should close the door behind them and lock it themselves. When returning, they should use the key to open it. This is very simple and reduces the chance of robbers breaking in. It is indeed the best way to prevent them. (2) Most robberies occur around 7:00, 8:00, or 9:00 p.m. This is because it is customary for shops to close at this time and collect the day's sales at the accounting table to count and settle accounts. This provides an opportunity for robbers to break in and rob. If the shops close the door and settle accounts after closing, or if they can gradually store the day's sales upstairs during the day, the robbers will find it more difficult to climb the stairs and rob. (3) Installing an alarm bell is the most convenient way to report a crime. However, smaller shops may find it too expensive. If several shops can jointly set up one (such as the electric bell in a hotel that calls the tea room to drop the number plate), the cost to each shop will be reduced, and the effect will be great. (4) Robbers must scout the area for two or three days before committing a crime to see if there are any police officers nearby and how many people there are in the shops and residences. They carefully consider the escape route after the robbery before taking action. They never act rashly. If the shops and residents are attentive and observant, if they see any suspicious behavior, they should immediately report it to the district office so that they can pay attention. If a case occurs, it will be easier to catch them. (5) Residents and shops in Shanghai are accustomed to minding their own business and ignoring what is happening around them. Therefore, when robbers commit a robbery, they know that the neighbors only seek their own safety and will not help or report the crime. Only then do they dare to rob safely. If residents in the streets and neighborhoods can help each other and report the crime for each other, the robbers will have more concerns and will find it difficult to use their tricks. (6) Recently, many street robbery cases have occurred. The reason for this is that the money carried is not kept very securely and is seen by the robbers, resulting in losses. From now on, when shops send people to collect money, they should be carefully instructed to carry it discreetly along the way and not show it to the robbers. This can prevent the risk of being robbed.</p>
<h3>Winter Defense Meeting of the Songbao Authorities</h3>
<p>Qiu Minggu, the magistrate of Baoshan County, convened a special winter defense meeting at 1:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, attended by Shi Guanxi, the commander of the Lion Forest Fort of the Fortress Command, Zhang Han, the director of the Fourth District of the Wusong Water Police, and Wang Qingtao, Lu Fengpu, Yang Weixiong, the chiefs of the local defense corps, Qian Tianpeng, the director of the Construction Bureau, Wang Chuan, the section chief of the county government, Xue Ying, etc. The meeting was chaired by Qiu Minggu, and the following resolutions were immediately made: (1) The winter defense period will be from now until February 20th of the twentieth year. If necessary, it may be extended. (2) The joint defense measures for winter defense will be decided, and the implementation will be approved at the next meeting. (3) The Fourth District of the Water Police will assign additional police officers and deploy patrol boats to patrol various sand islands outside Songkou, such as Changxing Ruifeng Stone Island. (4) Strict household registration investigations will be implemented, and attention will be paid to the straw sheds in Jiangbei to prevent villains from mingling. In addition, there are several other proposals that will be submitted for discussion and public resolution at the next meeting.</p>
<h3>Disputes over Water Charges After the Water Rate Increase</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Waterworks Company increased its rates in September, the matter has not been resolved due to the opposition of various groups. However, the company insists on charging according to the increased amount, so the dispute is still raging. For example, Dou Yaoji Real Estate Company received a letter from the Shanghai Waterworks Company stating that it should send the bills for the six-percent water fee for the two locations on Beikai Road and Yangshupu in September so that it could be verified; otherwise, the water would be cut off on the 30th of this month. (The letter was printed with the words "Six-Percent Water Fee for Chinese Houses.") The company immediately prepared the water fee bills and the water fee bills for Aiduya Road and Longmen Road managed by it, and sent the six-percent water fee due along with the bills to the Shanghai Waterworks Company as usual. However, the Shanghai Waterworks Company actually returned the bills and the water fee and added the amount of the water fee increase on the bills. The company believes that the 30th day for cutting off the water is approaching, and the issue of the rate increase has not been resolved. If the Shanghai Waterworks Company actually cuts off the water at that time, causing various losses in life and property to the company's owners and tenants, it will hold the Shanghai Waterworks Company fully responsible. The company has already sent letters to the Shanghai Waterworks Company and the Chinese Ratepayers Association separately to inquire and appeal for support.</p>
<h3>Wang Huiru Detained Again</h3>
<p>Commits Two Cases in the French Concession</p>
<p>Judge Xu Approves the Transfer</p>
<p>Wang Huiru (also known as Wang Laowu), a twenty-nine-year-old Anhui native residing at No. 6 Xudong Lane, Tongfu Road, Huxi, was known for his wealth. Two years ago, he was involved in a kidnapping case and was arrested by the Xinzha Police Station. He was sentenced to eleven months in prison by the Provisional Court. Wang refused to accept the sentence and appealed, but the original judgment was upheld, and he was sent to the Xilao Prison in Tilanqiao to serve his sentence. He was released after his term expired last year. On the night before last at 9:30 p.m., Wang was arrested again for another case. At that time, Wang was passing through Nanjing Road when he was seen by a Chinese detective from the No. 38 French Concession Police Station, who reported to the No. 608 Indian sentry at that location, stating that the French police had recently captured kidnappers who had implicated Wang. Wang was detained and taken to the Laozha Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Xu Jiashi presided over the first criminal court for interrogation. Prosecutor Xu Mu also attended the court to perform prosecutorial duties. After Judge Xu asked Wang about his age, place of origin, and address, the police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the case, saying that Wang had been arrested by detectives from the French Police Station at the Laozha Police Station last night. According to the detectives, Wang committed the crimes of attempted murder and supplying firearms to robbers in the French Concession. Therefore, the French Police Station requested the French Public Concession to issue an arrest warrant to transfer him. Upon investigation, the arrest warrant issued by the French Public Concession must be signed by the French Consul to be valid. However, the arrest warrant for Wang Huiru held by the French Police Station's foreign detective Lailier did not have the French Consul's signature or the Public Concession's seal. Therefore, it was not convenient to hand him over that night. Should Wang be allowed to be taken away now? Please let the judge decide. Now, the police station has brought the criminals who implicated Wang to court for questioning. Then, Gielier translated that the French Police Station had recently captured nine robbers, including Lu Lansheng, Duan Adi, and Lan Dagou. It had been found that these people had committed two robbery cases: (1) the robbery of property from the resident of No. 44 Lu Mei Road at 7:00 p.m. on September 30th; (2) the robbery of a pawnshop on Julai Road, during which the owner was shot in the right chest. According to the three robbers Lu, Duan, and Lan, the two pistols they used were borrowed from Wang Huiru. Therefore, the French Public Concession was requested to issue a warrant to arrest Wang. However, it was already late at that time, and the French Consul was not at the Public Concession, so the warrant could not be signed by the French Consul. Today is also a holiday for the French Public Concession. Although the warrant has been signed by the French Consul, the legal seal has not been affixed. Please allow the transfer. Then, according to Chinese detective No. 38, it was learned yesterday that Wang had opened room No. 438 at the Dongya Hotel on Nanjing Road. He went to investigate and saw that the guest in that room was registered as a Shi. Then, he saw Wang leaving the room and arrested him on the way. According to Lu Lansheng, he and Wang Laowu met in the Xilao Prison in Tilanqiao, introduced by a fellow prisoner Cao Guisheng. On the ninth day of August this year, Cao and others planned to rob Lu Mei Road. Because they did not have firearms, Cao suggested borrowing them from Wang. He and Jin Sheng went to Wang's house. At that time, Cao told Wang that he was fighting with someone and lacked pistols, so he came to borrow them. Wang went upstairs and brought out two pistols and handed them over. Cao took them out and went to rob Lu Mei Road. He fired one shot. Afterwards, he withdrew two hundred yuan from the account as a reward for borrowing the guns. According to Lan Dagou, he met Wang through Cao Guisheng's introduction in the Xilao Prison. When questioned, Wang Huiru said that he was only one wall away from Cao in prison, so he knew each other. Old prisoners in prison must bully new prisoners. After I got out of prison, I met Lan Dagou on Nanjing Road and was even borrowed ten yuan. This time, they must have been coerced by the French police to make false accusations. I have a lot of assets, so how could I do this illegal thing for two hundred yuan? If I had hidden weapons, there would be more than just two pistols. The police can search my house. The foreign detective of the French Police Station absolutely denied Wang's statement of being coerced and said that all the prisoners were there and could be questioned. Lan Dagou also claimed that his confession at the French Police Station was voluntary. Judge Xu then instructed that Wang Huiru be allowed to be handed over to the detectives of the French Police Station to be brought back and investigated.</p>
<h3>Zhou Changshun Escapes Kidnapping and is Injured</h3>
<p>Escapes by Climbing Over a Wall, Shot in the Right Shoulder</p>
<p>Surgery is Postponed, Hoping for No Changes</p>
<p>Zhou Changshun, courtesy name Changshan, the grandson of the late merchant Zhou Liantang, was kidnapped by bandits at the Jiangwan Racecourse on the morning of the 18th of last month. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, he took the opportunity to climb over a wall and escape. After being discovered by the bandits, they chased after him and fired at him, shooting Zhou in the right shoulder. At that time, Zhou ignored everything, fled for his life in pain, and was fortunate to meet Gao Yinguang and other patrol officers from the Third Section of the Sixth District, who learned the whole story. Director Liu immediately sent a police car to the Red Cross for treatment. The details have been reported in the newspapers. It is now known that yesterday Zhou was in the hospital. After the doctor examined him, he found that Zhou was mentally exhausted, and the surgery was postponed. Therefore, the bullet has not yet been removed. His temperature is over 38 degrees, and his pulse is slightly lower than when he arrived at the hospital. Fortunately, he is still conscious. The doctor has strictly forbidden him to talk too much and has declined visits from relatives and friends. Only his wife and a nurse are in the ward. According to the doctor, Zhou's condition is still unpredictable. It will not be safe to determine until after the operation and there are no changes.</p>

<h3>Ten Suspects Who Extorted Jiang Fusheng</h3>
<p>Taken Over by the Special District Court</p>
<p>Jiang Fusheng, a Suzhou native residing at No. 580 Zhonghua Road, Nanshi, is a storyteller by trade. He recently received threatening letters demanding money and scheduled a meeting at room No. 15 of the Yunzhou Hotel on Beihai Road at 4:30 p.m. the day before yesterday. Jiang sent the letter to the Laozha Police Station and requested an investigation. The police station sent Chinese and foreign detectives to the hotel and arrested ten people: Lin Junyi, Yang Jiaqing, Chen Fengxiang, Zhao Jinbiao, Ke Hengyou, Han Youtang, Wang Jinhe, Lu Wencai, Xie Gengsheng, and Liu Zhenggui, all from Yangzhou. Yesterday, they were sent to the Special District Local Court for investigation. The Municipal Public Security Bureau stated that the plaintiff's address was in the Chinese area and sent detectives to the court, requesting that the defendants be transferred. However, the police lawyer stated that the arrest location was in the concession and that most of the defendants were veterans without fixed addresses, so the Special District Court could also hear the case. Judge Xu immediately ruled that both the Shanghai Local Court and the Special District Court could hear the case. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi then declared that he was prosecuting Lin and the other ten under Article 370, paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law for attempted extortion. After interrogation, the judge instructed that the defendants be remanded in custody for another hearing.</p>
<h3>The Sad Words of a Fourteen-Year-Old Girl</h3>
<p>Guo Xiaofeng Rescued After Attempting Suicide</p>
<p>At dawn the day before yesterday, a young woman was seen floating in a river in the jurisdiction of the Fourth District, Third Section, Zhenru. A local woman who was passing by bravely stepped forward and managed to rescue her. She was handed over to the police station. After questioning by the director, she identified herself as Guo Xiaofeng, fourteen years old, from Jiangbei. Her parents are alive. Her father's name is Da Bing, who works as a night-soil carrier and is very kind to me. Unexpectedly, in February of this year, I was tricked and abducted to Shanghai by an unknown old woman and sold to a certain family in Wusong as a child bride for one hundred yuan. I am often abused by my in-laws, not warmly clothed, not fed, and treated like a slave. Recently, I have been forced to get married. Because I am still young, I vowed not to agree, which led to beatings. I took the opportunity to escape the day before yesterday. Thinking that there was no point in living, I angrily threw myself into the river to commit suicide. The director, seeing that the girl was young and easily took her own life, felt pity for her and sent her to the judicial section for disposition.</p>
<h3>One Accusation of Illegal Imprisonment, One Accusation of Kidnapping a Prostitute</h3>
<p>Yang Jiabao and Wu Qiuxiang</p>
<p>Both Originally Released on Bail Pending Investigation</p>
<p>Yang Youshan, residing in the Yangshupu area, accompanied by a lawyer, reported to the French Concession Police Station on the 12th of this month, stating that the plaintiff's son, Yang Jiabao, 18 years old this year, went out for a stroll with his friend Lü A'gen on the 11th. Unexpectedly, Wu Qiuxiang (also known as Cuixiang Lao Wu), a madam who runs a brothel on Simalu (Fourth Avenue), illegally imprisoned him in the house of Ye Zhongheng at No. 32 Baoyu Lane, demanding money. He requested that the case be investigated. The detective agreed and immediately ordered patrol officers to arrest Ye and Lao Wu together and bring them to the police station. After interrogation, they were ordered to be released on bail pending investigation. Yesterday, they were summoned to the French Court for interrogation. The plaintiff, Yang Jiabao, accompanied by a lawyer, appeared in court, reiterating the previous circumstances and stating that his friend, Lü A'gen, had taken the defendant Wu Qiuxiang's prostitute, Yuzhen, to see a play at the Weiyang Grand Theatre in his jurisdiction. Taking advantage of the opportunity, A'gen led the prostitute away. The defendant then detained the plaintiff, Yang Jiabao, accusing him of colluding in the kidnapping, and successively imprisoned him in the Fuxing Hotel and No. 32 Baoyu Lane, as well as a certain hotel in the British Concession, constantly threatening him and attempting to extort 600 yuan, but failed. The defendants have committed the crime of infringing on freedom under Article 316 of the Criminal Law, and he requested a strict investigation. The defendant, Wu Qiuxiang, represented by lawyer Jin Yu and assistant lawyer Li Yuan, argued that on the 11th of this month, the plaintiff, together with his friend Lü A'gen (also known as "Flower Butterfly A'gen"), came to take the defendant's prostitute, Yuzhen, to see a play at the Weiyang Grand Theatre. Unexpectedly, A'gen led Yuzhen away and escaped in a rickshaw. However, the defendant's maid, Ms. So-and-so, who had accompanied them to the play, saw Yuzhen being kidnapped and immediately grabbed Yang Jiabao. She then called for the defendant. The plaintiff agreed to find a way to find the bond and the prostitute, so they went together to No. 32 Baoyu Lane. Yang Jiabao sent someone to invite his father to No. 32 to discuss ways to find them. This is the truth, and there was no intimidation or extortion. In short, the defendant's prostitute was kidnapped by the plaintiff in collusion, which is a fact. As for the plaintiff's allegations, there is no evidence. He requested that the case be dismissed.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Yang Jiabao testified that he was a worker at the Tongxing Cotton Mill. On that day, Lü A'gen invited him to the defendant's place to take the prostitute to see a play. Unexpectedly, A'gen took the prostitute away while he was relieving himself. Therefore, the maid detained him and called for the madam, Lao Wu, who illegally imprisoned him in the hotel for eleven hours. But he was indeed deceived beforehand and did not dare to collude in the kidnapping. Wu Qiuxiang testified that the plaintiff, Yang Jiabao, had come with A'gen several times. This time, he dared to collude in the kidnapping. She did ask him about it at the time, which was true, and she did not dare to extort money. She asked for an investigation. Ye Zhongheng testified that he had known Qiuxiang for a long time. That evening, they came to his place to discuss ways to find them, and he did not dare to collude in extortion. Judge Zhu Cheng ordered the plaintiff and defendant to be released on bail pending judgment.</p>
<h3>Naked Man and Woman</h3>
<p>The Sister-in-law Was Too Ruthless</p>
<p>The Father Forced Her Too Urgently</p>
<p>Xu Zhu, a woman from Suqian, 33 years old, lived in a flat behind the Huayuan Stone Bridge on Lan Nidu in Pudong. Her husband had worked as a dock coolie and had passed away six or seven years ago. Ms. Song initially vowed to remain a widow, relying on her husband's brother for support. However, her sister-in-law, Ge (32 years old), was very narrow-minded and often argued with Zhu. Zhu found the sarcasm and cold remarks unbearable, so she separated from her brother and sister-in-law in March of this year according to the lunar calendar, and went to the Longmao Warehouse to pick floral clothes to make a living. However, her wages were only four or five hundred cash per day, which was difficult to survive on. Forced to change her mind, she became intimate with Li Rongqing, a fellow villager. Li was 31 years old and worked as a cook. The two of them formed a small family at the east end of Xiaoyangjing Temple. But good things are often hard to come by. Zhu's father came to Shanghai from his hometown a few days ago and did not see his daughter's whereabouts, immediately arousing suspicion. He strongly accused her sister-in-law, Ge, of selling her off for a price, complaining incessantly. Ge, feeling wronged, was extremely angry. At three o'clock yesterday morning, she gathered many people and, without making a sound, broke into Zhu's bedroom, dragged Li Rongqing out of the bed, and tied up both him and Zhu with ropes, completely naked. Li shouted for help. Fortunately, a patrol officer from the Third District of the Public Security Bureau was passing by and went forward to inquire. The helpers scattered like birds and beasts. The two were untied, ordered to put on their clothes, and taken to the district along with Ge. Zhu's father, upon hearing this news, considered it a matter of face and immediately fled far away. After the district chief investigated the circumstances of catching the adulterers, he ruled that Ge should not have resorted to such base means and ordered her to be transferred to the court for disposal.</p>
<h3>National Products Association Sends Telegram Requesting Exemption from National Product Advertising Tax</h3>
<p>The China National Products Maintenance Association recently sent a telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, stating, "Respectfully to Chairman Ye of the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Zhenjiang: Respectfully reporting, we have recently received a letter from Cheng Ganqing, director of the Zhenchangxisu branch of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, stating: 'Respectfully reporting, we have investigated the Provincial Government Gazette of this year, March 15th, Issue No. 387, which published the approval of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's consultation, based on the Shanghai National Products Factory Association's request for exemption from the national product advertising tax. The Central Executive Committee approved the deliberation by the Ministries of Industry and Commerce, Finance, and Internal Affairs, deciding that all national product advertisements should be exempt from taxation, and consulted the provincial government to instruct its subordinate financial departments to investigate national product advertisements. If there are bureaus that collect taxes, they must be ordered to stop collecting them immediately to promote national products and conform to the decision. This is a case approved by the ministry and an order issued by the provincial government. Subordinate agencies should earnestly implement it. Our company's products are also a type of national product. Posting advertisements should be free of charge without any doubt. Both Jiangsu and Changzhou have already complied, but resistance has arisen in Wuxi and Zhenjiang, obstructing and resisting, disregarding the ministry's deliberation and the provincial order. Repeatedly arguing with reason has yielded no results, greatly hindering the promotion of national products and causing concern for the future of the industry. Compelled by circumstances, we have no choice but to petition your association to request the provincial government to investigate the established case and promptly order the counties of Wuxi and Dantu to no longer obstruct our company's national product advertisements. This would be greatly beneficial to the public.' Based on this, we respectfully note that promoting national products is an important policy of the party and the country. All things that benefit national products are earnestly implemented to achieve practical results. Now, the exemption of the national product advertising tax has been deliberated, approved, and ordered by the Ministries of Internal Affairs, Finance, and Industry, and published in the Provincial Government Gazette No. 387 of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Jiangsu and Changzhou have already complied, but Zhenjiang and Wuxi are the only ones that do not comply with the laws and regulations and arbitrarily collect taxes, not only hindering the sales of national products but also affecting the credibility of the ministries and provinces. Our association, as a national product group, specially reports the situation by telegram. We respectfully request that your office investigate the established case and promptly order the counties of Wuxi and Dantu to comply with the order to exempt the national product advertising tax and no longer obstruct it, so that national products can be sold smoothly. We are eagerly anticipating this. Respectfully, Wang Jie'an, Wang Xingyi, and Wang Hanqiang, Standing Committee Members of the China National Products Maintenance Association, respectfully kowtow, with seal."</p>

<h3>A Barber Dies from Drunkenness</h3>

His colleagues helped him to the back door to let the cool breeze sober him up. Unexpectedly, he collapsed and died shortly after. Someone reported it to the Yangshupu Police Station, which ordered Detective Chen Xikang to investigate. The body was moved to the Fei Lun Road autopsy station. Yesterday morning, Guo Huaipu, a prosecutor from the Special District Local Court, and a forensic doctor went to the station to conduct an autopsy. After taking the stand, he immediately accepted the complaint from the shop owner, Liu Chunlin, that Qiao Changbao had no family and that he would provide the coffin and burial. Mr. Guo then ruled that Qiao Changbao had died from excessive drinking and that the body could be buried by Liu Chunlin with a written guarantee.</p>
<h3>Zhang Sang, a Woman Involved in a Robbery Case, Dies</h3>
<p>Zhang Sang, a woman from Dongtai, was arrested by the Harbin Police Department and brought to the Special District Local Court for being involved in a robbery gang last summer. After interrogation, she was sentenced to three years in prison and sent to the women's prison. Recently, she suddenly suffered from stomach disease and weakness. She was sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, but she died at 3 AM yesterday morning. The body was sent to the Fei Lun Road autopsy station.

As no relatives were found, the Putuo Benevolent Hall was ordered to provide the coffin and burial.</p>
<h3>Old Li from Jiangbei Freezes to Death</h3>
<p>This is a Gift of the Red Pill</p>
<p>In a shack at the Zhou family's residence at No. 63 Huatuan, Zhabei, there lies a dwelling of humble origin. However, those who dwell within were originally from wealthy families. Later, because of their involvement in the underworld, followed by the addiction to "red pills," their family property was reduced to nothing, and their bodies became weak. Those addicted to "red pills" inevitably die within three years, their blood dried up and their bones rotten. However, the individuals in this humble dwelling, according to the local security chief, are even more bizarre. They indulge in opium smoking daily on the straw mats in the shack. Because, apart from the opium pipe and lamp, they have nothing else of value. Clothes can be dispensed with, food can be foregone, but the opium must not be abandoned. These people are akin to those beyond the pale of civilization, and the authorities can do nothing about them. Recently, with the weather turning colder, lacking clothes and bedding, the underworld ghosts in the humble dwelling could not resist the wrath of heaven. Thus, yesterday, an old Li from Jiangbei, about 30 years old, froze and starved to death, his whole body turning yellow, a testament to the harm of opium addiction. However, as he had no family, the police station ordered the local security chief, Yan Liugen, to report the death to the Local Court for autopsy. Prosecutor Li and others arrived at the scene to conduct the autopsy, which confirmed the cause of death. The court ordered the benevolent hall to provide the burial.</p>
<h3>Hu San's New Lawsuit for Stealing Land Outside of the Tan Mei Case</h3>
<p>Hu Yongji (aka Hu San), who was accused of defrauding Tan Meiying (梅影) of a land deed in the case against Mei Fei (梅妃, i.e., Chen Junxia), has fled. Recently, he has been accused of illegally selling land belonging to Qian Guanquan, a villager. The villager has retained lawyers Zhang Chongding and Li Yuan to file a criminal lawsuit, requesting the Shanghai Special District Local Court to arrest Hu Yongji and the people currently building fences on the land for interrogation. The court approved the request and ordered the summons of the defendant Hu San, who has not yet appeared. The court session was held the other day, and the plaintiff's lawyers and the plaintiff Qian Guanquan were present in court awaiting instructions. Judge Ge Zhitan conducted the interrogation, but no debate was opened. As a result, witnesses must be summoned to court, and another court date will be set for further summons and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Discharged Soldier Collapses and Dies</h3>
<p>A discharged soldier collapsed and died inside the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) Railway North Station yesterday. He was Feng Jinshan, over 30 years old, from the 27th Regiment of the 14th Brigade of the Fifth Division. He had a travel permit. The railway police ordered the local security chief, Yan Fugen, to report the death to the Local Court for autopsy.

<h3>Zhong Wuliu Goes Missing, Search Underway</h3>
<p>Zhong Wuliu (绍兴人之俗禮其父五十六歲養此子者名曰五六), a 14-year-old apprentice from Rongtaixiang Shop in Xue Alley, Huajinpailou, within the city walls, went missing at around 7 PM the other night. The next day, people were sent out to search for him, but he has not been found. Yesterday, the apprentice's appearance and the clothes he was wearing when he went missing were printed on leaflets with rewards. In addition to reporting the matter to the police station in charge, requesting that they keep an eye out for the apprentice's whereabouts, leaflets have been distributed to the public, requesting that they pay attention and look for him.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Owner Robbed</h3>
<p>At the corner of Baoshan Road and Zhongxing Road in Zhabei, there is a place with a public weighing scale. Every morning, those who have a license for the weighing scale (commonly known as "vegetable owners") bring a scale to weigh and buy vegetables from the villagers in the open air and then resell them to vegetable vendors, deducting a commission. However, the vegetable owners must advance capital, so they must carry a certain amount of cash every morning to advance the money. Yao A'gen, the owner of the weighing scale in that area, is very successful. Every morning, he must advance more than one hundred yuan for the vegetable capital, which attracts the covetousness of bandits. Yesterday morning (the 27th), just before dawn, when Yao was carrying cash to weigh and buy vegetables at the place, two bandits suddenly came, each holding a handgun, threatening Yao and others to be silent. They forcibly grabbed Yao's cash and paper money in his coat pocket, totaling more than one hundred yuan, and fled northward.</p>
<h3>County Police Chief Transferred to Qingpu</h3>

In the future, if any of the aforementioned dilapidated houses are found, a report should first be submitted to this Bureau to request the Public Works Bureau to send personnel to conduct a clear inspection before handling it. In addition to the distribution, this notice is issued to the district chiefs for compliance and to instruct their subordinates to be informed."</p>
<h3>Family of Deceased Sailor Zhou Jinquan Receives Money</h3>
<p>For many years, when sailors and passengers on various Chinese and foreign ships died en route, their remains were thrown into the sea for burial at sea, as the ships did not have coffins and mortuaries. In addition, the journey was long, so burial at sea was the only option to prevent stench and affect the health of those on board. Later, the Tung Wah Hospital in Hong Kong, with charity in mind, donated five or more coffins to each Chinese and foreign merchant ship. Then, donation boxes were set up on each ship, allowing passengers to freely donate and put money into the boxes to recover costs. Chinese and foreign passengers and crew members were very grateful, and many freely donated. However, in recent years, the same measures have not been taken on various Chinese and foreign cargo ships. Therefore, cargo ship crew members who die en route are still buried at sea. The China Seamen's Union has recently received a report from the family of Zhou Jinquan, a manager on the Guanghua Petroleum Company's ship柯派柯尔, stating that Jinquan died of illness near the "Shambit" oil field while the ship was traveling, and was buried at sea. They described the tragedy and requested that his estate be collected. In addition to the Seamen's Union assisting in collecting Zhou Jinquan's estate from the consulate, they deeply feel that the burial at sea of cargo ship crew members who die of illness is closely related to humanitarianism and the future. They have recently decided to contact the Tung Wah Hospital again, requesting that all Chinese and foreign cargo ships be treated in the same way as merchant ships. The following is a record of the Hong Kong Seamen's Association's report to the Seamen's Union and the committee's collection of Zhou Jinquan's estate: (1) The Hong Kong Seamen's Association reported, "Reporting matter: According to the report from the family of Zhou Jinquan, a manager on the Guanghua Petroleum Company's ship柯派柯尔, Zhou Jinquan died of illness near the Shambit oil field in September of this year and was buried at sea. However, he left behind unpaid wages and loans totaling more than ten pounds. The ship owner sent them to the local consul, who sealed and sent them to the US Consul in China, and there was also a letter from fellow workers such as Chen Huafen informing them to go to the consulate to collect the money. However, the deceased member's wife is young and his children are young and do not have the procedures. It is proposed that your association send someone to go with them to collect the money. Respectfully reporting for inspection and handling. Respectfully to the Union, Qiu Yaokuan, Committee of the Preparatory Office of the Hong Kong Branch." (2) The report of the Seamen's Union sending someone to collect the money on behalf of the family, "In accordance with the letter No. Zhengzi 4855, I was ordered to go to the British Consulate Maritime Affairs Office in this port at 2 PM on the 19th of this month with the deceased worker Zhou Jinquan's wife, Zhou Yang, and his father, Yang. I met Consul Beiyue, and I personally guaranteed that Zhou Yang was indeed Zhou Jinquan's wife. I then handed over the total cash estate of 346.7 yuan in national currency, and Zhou Yang signed for it. Respectfully reporting for inspection and filing. Li Zuyao, Secretary of the Seamen's Union, respectfully."</p>
<h3>Minxin Bank Scheduled to Open</h3>

<h3>Tuition Fees of the Faculty of Law and Politics</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Faculty of Law and Politics on Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession, when Xu Qian was the principal, borrowed 85,000 yuan from a certain capitalist due to insufficient funds for building the school. Later, due to changes in the political situation, Xu Qian went abroad, and the principal was replaced several times. The creditor has repeatedly sought repayment of the loan from the current principal and school board, and the matter has been delayed until now without a solution. Therefore, the creditor has retained Lawyer Pan to submit a document to the Ministry of Education of the National Government, requesting that the school be ordered to settle the debt by the end of 1930. Because the creditor is in urgent need of funds, he has recently continued to request Lawyer Pan to draft another document to the Ministry of Education, requesting the revocation of the school's registration and permission to liquidate the school site to repay the debt if the matter is further delayed. It is unknown how the Ministry of Education will handle this matter.</p>
<h3>ABC Underwear Factory Opens New Machines</h3>

The workers wear工衣自製 (self-made work clothes) of the factory, which is especially neat and uniform. The other day, the factory convened the third savings group to visit the factory, and they all praised it greatly. The savers believe that the factory uses savings to assist industry and uses industry to guarantee savings, so they are happy to invest in savings.</p>

The Tianfa Fur Bureau in Paqiuchang has been a well-known large fur store in Shanghai for a long time. It has traveled to various ports over the years to purchase valuable furs and sell them at low prices. It is now heard that the two stores, in order to help all sectors of society solve the problem of winter clothing, have specially agreed to hold a joint silk and fur grand price reduction starting on November 29th. They are currently preparing, and it will soon be announced in the newspapers. This joint price reduction measure is still a pioneering effort in Shanghai, and it is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>Worker Injured by Car</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 6 PM, Jin Wenqi, an obstetrician, was driving his own car when a man resembling a worker, about 30 years old, wearing a blue cloth shirt and trousers, suddenly ran out from Nan Shi Da Ma Tou (Great Wharf). Although the driver caught a glimpse of him, it was too late to stop, and the car hit him, causing him to fall to the ground. The wheels then ran over his head, causing injury, brains splashed, and was extremely miserable. The patrol police heard about it and rushed to the scene, immediately detained the car, and sent the injured man to the Shanghai Hospital for treatment.

<h3>Mutual Accusations Between Men and Women in a Sordid Society</h3>
<p>Ms. Zhang Wei and Xu Songlin</p>
<p>Zhang Wei, a 29-year-old woman from Taizhou, yesterday, along with her cohabitant Xue Zhou, brought Xu Songlin to the Fourth District General Office to file a complaint. Director Jin interrogated the plaintiff, Ms. Zhang, who stated that her husband runs a wine shop at No. 6, Le'anfang, Mongol Road, and that around 10 PM the night before, she went out to fetch water. While passing by an alley, she was suddenly accosted by the defendant, Xu Songlin, who, along with two others, brandished weapons and threatened her. Xu held a knife to her chest, while the other two stripped off her original-colored woolen qipao, and together they robbed her of thirty dollars in banknotes, several small silver coins, and over ten copper coins she had on her. They then fled in different directions. She saw Xu escape into the Jinxi Inn nearby, but as it was already late at night, she didn't pursue them. Instead, she returned home to sleep and reported the incident to the police this morning, who arrested Xu and brought him to the office for investigation. Xue Zhou stated that Ms. Zhang was her tenant and that she was unaware of the robbery of clothes and money the night before. The defendant, Xu, a 32-year-old from Baoshan, who lives at the Jin Chang Inn on Mongol Road, stated that he had become acquainted with Ms. Zhang through Zhou's introduction in August of this year. He had spent a considerable amount of money on her, but Ms. Zhang turned out to be fickle and had recently found another lover. He was so angry that he took back the clothes he had given her, but he denied taking any money. The Director, after reviewing the testimonies, noted that the case involved robbery with weapons, and the testimonies differed. He ordered that the case be transferred to the bureau for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: In a news item published in your newspaper's local news column on the 17th of this month, it stated that Cheng Zhang, a staff member of the Yutai Pawnshop on Fangbang Road, absconded with gold jewelry worth six or seven thousand dollars, and after the pawnshop reported the incident to the Second Branch of the First District of the Public Security Bureau, it was discovered that he was hiding in the Nanyang Hospital in Xiaonanmen, Nanshi. The director of the branch ordered detectives Li Dingyuan and police officer Cheng Rufu to arrest him. We were shocked to read this. The total value of the ornaments lost from our pawnshop was only slightly more than three thousand. Rufu was also present at the time as one of the representatives of the pawnshop, so he was also at the scene. Now your newspaper mistakenly identifies him as a police officer, which is inconsistent with the original facts. We are afraid that the outside world will misunderstand the truth, causing misunderstandings. We are writing to inform you and ask you to investigate and publish a letter to correct this matter. Sincerely, Cheng Rufu, Yutai Pawnshop, November 20th. To the Editor: I have read the news item in your newspaper's local news column on the 26th about welcoming Mr. Chu Minyi. There are some minor errors, so I am writing to correct them as follows: (1) Shao Ru-xin is mistakenly written as Shao Ru-sheng. (2) The Huzhou fellow villagers' separate banquet is mistakenly written as the Huzhou Fellow Villagers Association's separate banquet. Please publish this letter in the letter column to clarify the facts. Thank you very much. Sincerely, the Shanghai Preparatory Office for Welcoming Mr. Chu, the representative of the National Government participating in the Belgian Exposition, November 27th.</p>

<h3>Jiaotong University's Swimming Program</h3>
<p>Jiaotong University has very well-equipped swimming facilities. After losing the swimming competition to Jinan University this year, they felt that it would be difficult to wash away the shame without making an effort to practice. Therefore, there is a plan to heat the swimming pool. The method is to install hot water pipes at the bottom of the swimming pool to keep the water temperature in the pool at around 15 degrees Celsius. In the cold winter, electric heaters must be installed around the pool, so that even in extremely cold weather, practice can continue without interruption. After the school's swimming team has obtained this special equipment, it has become even more diligent. It is specifically stipulated that Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays are the team members' practice periods. At that time, the captain will call the roll. Those who are not absent for a semester will be rewarded by the director of physical education. Those who are absent once will be given a verbal warning by the captain, twice a written warning, and three or more times, the captain will ask the director of physical education to issue a written warning. If they still ignore it, they will be deemed to have withdrawn from the team, and the student's physical education score will be deemed failing. The team members are able to abide by the regulations and work hard. Since February, there has never been an absentee, so the results have greatly improved. The achievements of each team member are described below:</p>
<p>The Ye Brothers: Ye Hang is the elder brother, and Ye Wu is the younger brother. The two Ye brothers are the most diligent in practice among all the team members. The elder Ye's 200-meter crawl can already be swum within the time of the Jiangda record, and the posture is excellent. Given time, there will be amazing records. The younger Ye is a long-distance swimmer. Now the school's Master He has taught him the latest Long Distance Crawl method used in the United States. The Ye brothers practice purely and are making progress every day. The 3,000 meters can be swum in 33 minutes, which is almost the same as the Jiangda record.</p>
<p>Mr. Ling Chongju: Mr. Ling is the nephew of Ling Hongxun, the former president of the school and current director of the Longhai Railway Engineering Bureau. He is naturally skilled in swimming, and he grew up in Guangdong, accompanied by rivers and seas. Since being selected as a team member, he has also worked very hard. The 200-meter breaststroke can be swum in one minute and twenty-seven seconds, breaking the Jiangda record.</p>
<p>The above three gentlemen are the brightest members of the school's swimming team. They are now under the guidance of designated lecturers, and it is also heard that the school's physical education department believes that swimming is especially important in physical strength. In order to strengthen the team members' physical strength, the school doctor has been specially invited to formulate ten rules for the team members' daily life and diet to be followed. The general idea of the rules is to set the time for daily life, how to control the diet, etc. In addition, the team members' meals are also borrowed by the school authorities to provide rich nutrition.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Fudan Publications</h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>There are no fewer than a thousand students, male and female, at Fudan University. There are indeed many who have made achievements in literary research. Therefore, in the past two years, small publications that focus on literature and art have been popular for a while, such as "Modern Literature," "Asahi," "Humor," and "Contemporary Literature." At the beginning of their publication, they attracted the attention of the Shanghai literary world. After all, due to economic reasons, they were discontinued one after another after publishing a few issues. However, its achievements, in the history of the publishing world, cannot be completely buried. However, it is a pity that it was discontinued soon after it was published. Now, publications on literature and art and other topics have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain. Because the publication period is short, perhaps outsiders are still unaware of them. Now I will briefly describe their content for the benefit of fellow enthusiasts.</p>
<p>A. Hongliu This is the most violent attack on Proletarian literature. Although only the inaugural issue has been published, it has attracted the attention of students and the outside world, because some of the articles in it are very logical in discussing the decline of Proletarian literature. It makes a complete criticism of past general Proletarian publications, and obviously contains deep insights. It is extremely familiar with the current publishing world and is by no means a casually produced work of scolding. An article criticizing "Literature Lectures" objectively criticizes each article in it, and of course points out hundreds of mistakes, because the so-called Marxist writings only deceive the blindly following youth. Those with a little deep knowledge will never be tempted by their mad rantings. Therefore, in today's era of clearing up thoughts, such critical texts are very necessary for their production. At least, its power can point out a correct ideological path for young people who love literature and art. At the same time, the publication also expresses its approval of nationalist literature, but their attitude has not been clearly revealed. A publication always has its own goals, and it must not engage in ambiguity. Only with this point, we consider it a regret.</p>
<p>B. Huoban This is a purely literary publication, including novels, poems, essays, etc. Each work has an upward consciousness and holds a dissatisfied aim for Proletarian literature, but they have not published a complete critical article, but only one issue. Or if this article is found later, at the same time, this is also what we hope for.</p>
<p>C. Journal of the Department of Sociology This is a bimonthly publication edited by the publishing department of the Alumni Association of the Department of Sociology. Two issues have been published. The content is extremely rich. Writers are students and teachers working together. This publication is highly recommended for those who study social sciences. The main points of these two issues are excerpted below: 1. Ying Chengyi's "What is Truth?" Xiao Yuan's "Principles of Group Conflict," Chen Yuchun's "Relationship between Instinct, Habit, and Wisdom," Wang Zaiqin's "Animal Sociology," Li Hongsheng's "On Modern Social and Cultural Phenomena," Chen Peisen's "Research on Allied Strikes," Mao Qi's "Fudan University's Plan to Investigate the Income of Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers." The arguments in each article are mostly precise and correct, which is commendable. It is very gratifying to be able to read powerful treatises in such a small publication. It is heard that the third issue may also be published soon, including an article by Mr. Ying Chengyi, "The Truth and Falsehood of the Theory of Social Evolution," which is very noteworthy for us.</p>
<p>D. The Importance and Implementation of Journalism Education This is the recent work of Director Xie of the Department of Journalism, published by the Journalism Society. The content discusses the importance of journalism education, especially in our country. It is really necessary to promote this education. The implementation focuses on the curriculum organized by the Department of Journalism of this school, and cites the facilities of journalism departments in various countries for comparison. This is entirely Director Xie's detailed development of his experience. If national universities were to open journalism departments, this book could be used as a reference, because such works have not yet been found in domestic publications. The pricing is also very low. Scholars who study journalism or education can also purchase and read it, and can really obtain considerable help from it.</p>
<p>There are many other publications in preparation, which will be reported to readers later. In short, such a wide range of publications as Fudan University is worthy of attracting the attention of outsiders. That is to say, the above types belong to the brilliant side in terms of content, which is also worthy of our praise.</p>

<h3>The Second Issue of Vanguard Monthly</h3>
<p>— Gao Wei</p>
<p>Published by Modern Bookstore</p>
<p>Since the publication of the "Inaugural Issue of Vanguard Monthly," the activity in the Chinese literary scene has become even more profound. This is an inevitable result and nothing to be surprised about. Today, the inclination of young people who love the arts towards the nationalist literary movement is a fact formed by objective conditions. Therefore, they are eagerly reading and accepting it. Now the second issue has been published, and the table of contents includes: Fu Yanchang's "The Literary Movement Centered on National Consciousness," Chen Baoyi's "An Overview of the Development of Western Painting in Japan," Zhu Yingpeng's "Chinese Painting and Nationalism," Yang Minwei's "Chinese Ceramics and Nationalism," Li Zanhua's short story "Change," Zheng Bo's novel "Xiuer" (continued), and Tiran's short translation "The Night Watchman," and Li Jinfa's novel translation, "The End of Beijing," are all powerful works.</p>
<p>Fu Yanchang's "The Literary Movement Centered on National Consciousness," although only a short article of about a thousand words, is very pertinent and says what others have not said. The author bluntly states, "The literary works with national consciousness as the central idea, the most without status in the world, have to be pushed to us Chinese as the first. What we Chinese lack most in common sense is this national consciousness." This is so true. If Chinese people had national consciousness, they would never be ridiculed as a heap of loose sand. Because with national consciousness, there will be激昂 group action. Group action is always𤍠情的 and beneficial to the nation. At present, what our Chinese literature lacks is this point. The encirclement of traditional thought really makes us feel sad. Therefore, if we want to promote a powerful idea that benefits the Chinese people to the general public, then this idea must be the opposite of traditional thought in order to gather together for a unified action for the nation.</p>
<p>...It doesn't matter how profound the thought is, as long as it can be utilized, it is good. What we Chinese people need now is just a national consciousness that can be utilized.</p>
<p>In our group's opinion, literary works should be a manifestation of life under the group, and definitely not a separate action for individuals to enjoy alone. Chinese literary works should be used by all Chinese people, and we will definitely not allow the free thought of everyone being muddy while I alone am clear. Someone said that as long as it is a Chinese literary work, it will inevitably tend towards nationalism - I say, just look at traditional literature and you will know this is wrong. The Chinese literary scene is now full of anti-nationalist traditional thought and literary works with individual-centered thought. The Chinese people who have been propagandized are therefore a heap of loose sand, or a pile of unusable garbage. The Chinese people have no group strength and no status in the international community. These are all the results of the propaganda promoted by literary works.</p>
<p>Arise, propagandize, let us engage in literary works and strive upwards with national consciousness as the central idea.</p>
<p>Chen Baoyi's "An Overview of the Development of Western Painting in Japan" is a history and current situation of the Japanese Western painting scene. The author's motivation for writing this article is seeing that although the Western painting movement in our country has a history of several years, it is still stagnant in tangible and intangible ways. Compared with Japan, it is truly incomparable. Therefore, at the beginning, the author pointed out the situation of the Chinese Western painting scene in detail, and explored from all aspects, believing that for our society and for our culture, it seems that we should not stop the upward trend of art, and should not stop engaging in artistic creation, in order to show a broad effect. In order to do this, we should all have mutual understanding, and individuals should seek their own upward progress, which seems natural. The individual upward progress of art will naturally become one of the cooperation of the whole. Although now is a time of practical difficulties, if we hold a sincere heart and a clear understanding, then when the time comes, we may break through various difficulties. At this time, we should work hard to forge ourselves, and work together to build, the Chinese Western painting scene and increase the brilliance of our new culture." Next, it mentions the development history and current situation of Western painting in Japan, and discovers that they are both Eastern nations, how brilliant they are, and what our situation is like. Can we not feel ashamed and reflect? They are steadfastly building art careers in many difficulties. This situation, seen as a national characteristic, also has outstanding advantages. As for the author's narrative of historical facts, it is very detailed and can be used as our reference.</p>
<p>But since painting is also one of the arts, what Baoyi said lacks theoretical elaboration and guidance on practical work. What is the relationship between Chinese painting and nationalism? Then we read Zhu Yingpeng's "Chinese Painting and Nationalism." This is worthy of our attention, especially for people who generally study art. Generally speaking, Chinese painting has its own special style, special techniques, special materials, and is different from the painting of all nations in the world. It is unique. Therefore, in the eyes of people with general concepts, they will think that these are our national art. Just add the banner of nationalism, and it will be considered our nationalist painting. The author expresses that "this general concept is the current thorn in the nationalist literary and art movement." Therefore, first determine the prerequisite principle, and then discuss whether the inherent Chinese painting is produced from the living consciousness formed from the standpoint of the nation, and whether it has assumed the mission of "for the nation" for its own national consciousness. Therefore, it is studied in two aspects, one is the issue of thought, and the other is the issue of technique and style. Thought can be divided into two types, one is feudal thought, and the other is world-weary thought. The painting theory of feudal thought can be represented by Lu Shiheng, Cao Zhi, Xie He, Zhang Yanyuan, Gu Yanwu...etc. They are fundamentally products of feudal politics. The painting theory of world-weary thought can be represented by Guo Zhao, Wang Wei, Zhang Huai, Su Shi, Ni Zan, Dong Qichang, Shi Tao, etc. Secondly, discuss the techniques and styles. Generally speaking, thought always occupies the main point in art, and painting is the same. Thought can produce techniques and styles. In other words, techniques and styles are just a tool of expression. We can prove this with German expressionism, French purism, Italian futurism, and Russian primitivism. Therefore, the techniques and styles of inherent Chinese painting have become decorative and freehand due to the relationship between feudal thought and world-weary thought. These two traditional thoughts and the inherent Chinese painting dominated by the techniques and styles they produce cannot be recognized as national art. The author also sees from the aspect of hindering national progress that inherent Chinese painting does not pay attention to the performance of life. Those painters are conquered by these two kinds of unified thoughts and are absolutely not responsible for life. The self-proclaimed noble freehand painters will never give up their cynical attitude, and will never plan for the lives of the people. Therefore, according to the "Manifesto of the Nationalist Literary and Art Movement," we should rise up and work hard to eliminate it. At the same time, future Chinese painting "should no longer seek a way to survive in the degenerate old painting, but should have new understanding and creation. Fundamentally, it should be confirmed that art and life must be integrated, and even more should burst out with blazing sparks and surging springs from the national purpose." And in the performance, special attention should be paid to: A. National shame and suffering, B. National primitive legends, C. National struggle history, D. National actual life, E. Praise of material civilization. This can also be said to be the mission of Chinese painting. "We need new understanding, new emotions, and new thoughts for painting, and at the same time we need new materials, new techniques, and new styles as tools for all expressions. These new techniques and styles should be created by the painter's efforts." Ah, people who are generally engaged in painting, don't just blindly drill on the old dead road. Please use your creativity. The author also establishes the minimum principles of our painting techniques and styles: (1) Take sketching as the basis, (2) Take healthy development as the standard of human beauty, (3) The composition must be rigorous, (4) Make with a deliberate attitude, (5) The color is mainly bright and𤍠烈, (6) Pay attention to lines, (7) Pay attention to the expression of movement.</p>
<p>Yang Minwei's "Chinese Ceramics and Nationalism" first explains the relationship between ceramics and the Chinese nation, and then narrates a brief reading of the history of Chinese ceramics, from the earthenware of the primitive era to the ceramics of the Han Dynasty, the celadon porcelain of the Jin Dynasty... the ceramics of the Yuan Dynasty, the ceramics of the Ming Dynasty, and the ceramics of the Qing Dynasty, which is very detailed. Finally, it discusses the efforts that the Chinese nation should make for ceramics. To save the declining trend of the ceramic industry, first reorganize the old factories across the country, and second, concentrate the spirit and strength. "In this way, the salvation of Chinese ceramics is equal to saving the Chinese nation itself. Therefore, the creation of ceramics by the Chinese nation is a creation with doctrine, a creation of nationalist ceramics. The art of ceramics of the Chinese nation is an art with doctrine, an art of nationalist ceramics. The ceramics of the Chinese nation have the original driving force centered on nationalism and nationalist art, and they will definitely be able to restore the glorious history of ceramics in the near future, not only to restore, but also to create. This major mission should be borne by the Chinese nation itself."</p>
<p>"Change" is a work by Li Zanhua standing on the主</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>righteous literary and artistic standpoint. The climax of the story is the terror of the communists encountered by a village. Women, children, and the elderly flee in cries. Originally, they were all doing their business quietly, but there was a big robbery of killing and arson without mercy, making innocent villagers taste the pain of, "The night is so dark, the mountain road is so rugged, where to go, the line of people is stunned." What kind of happiness is this? The author focuses on the mother of Wax Plum and the pig in the Wax Plum's pen. The pig that the mother of Wax Plum cares about day and night, thinking that this is a sum of money for the New Year, which has been arranged long ago, but she has to give it up because of the escape. And when she looks back at her home, it has been surrounded by a blood-red fire. What should be this kind of instinctive sadness? Therefore, from the reflection of the mother of Wax Plum, it fully expresses a profound sense of potential. In terms of branch skills, this creation is indeed very considerate, very natural, and there is no trace of artificiality. Moreover, the situation of the farmer's life is depicted very powerfully. As for the tightness of the structure, it is difficult to find loose places. In the creation of nationalist literature and art, this "Change" can be said to be a powerful expression.</p>
<p>"The Night Watchman" is the original work of Amelia Aharonian. According to the author's introduction, Aharonian is the most famous Armenian novelist of the twentieth century, and also a tireless warrior for the freedom and security of the nation. We can find Aharonian's melancholy and激昂 style in this article. What kind of feeling will his inner consciousness give the reader? The night watchman is a rebel against fate. He absolutely does not admit fate. If human beings have such a thing as fate, it is tantamount to saying that human beings have no intention of struggling. But how does he have this unique consciousness? He has his story. He told the people in the coffee shop that he had struggled with fate himself, and had overcome fate and defeated fate. In the hands of the violent, the enemy, because of the strong feeling of anti-fate, he even turned the violent to death. He had such an awareness at that time. He saw that the crane first pecked the snake, and then turned around and was entangled to death by the snake. But maybe it was the author's parable, "The struggle between the snake and the stork also caused a change in my heart. I have never heard anyone say that a snake can strangle a stork. The stork was originally the snake's mortal enemy, the incarnation of the snake's god of fate. However, today, how can its god of fate not be able to control it? Is it difficult for God to allow even a poisonous snake to become a stork's, unfair carnivorous, allow our fate to be solved by this Celt? No, I said to myself, my previous thoughts were wrong. A person must work hard to find a way out." Later, he finished telling his own story, and made the whole room people could not help but fluctuate "In many voices in the home, people heard the call for freedom," the whole article is very tense, we can say that it is a successful short story.</p>
<p>"The End of Beijing" is the original work of Pierre Loti of France, writing the tragedy of the Eight-Nation Alliance, which made me feel really thrilling after reading it, thinking of our nation being trampled on by foreign nations, and all kinds of insults, can not be indignant, and reflect, hoping to save the crisis of our nation. At the same time, general literary and art writers should also realize that we have not used such materials ourselves, but foreigners have already used them before us. Are you not ashamed? Alas, the end of Beijing is probably also a symbol of the end of China. This article has not been completed in this issue.</p>
<p>Looking at this issue of "Vanguard Monthly," we can think that it is substantial, but don't be complacent because of this. We still need to follow the "call" of progress and actively rush forward. My introduction ends here, as for the many essences, please readers analyze it themselves.</p>
<h3>The Manchuria-Mongolia Question</h3>
<p>— Nanxin</p>
<p>Compiled by Hua Qiyun</p>
<p>Manchuria and Mongolia occupy an important position in our China. Although they are located on the periphery, they are profound and significant for industrialists. However, this point has been valued by foreigners, that is, the Japanese's attention to our Manchuria and Mongolia, as long as there is a new problem in this area, their newspapers will definitely write about it greatly and promote it doubly, hoping to arouse the extra attention of people across the country and stimulate their interest in research, so that general readers can have a kind of attention role with the newspaper. Therefore, there are those who collect history books to examine the origin of this Manchuria-Mongolia question, those who write articles to criticize its current situation, and those who set it as speculation to predict its future. Soon, articles on this type of new question spread throughout the country. This is in terms of its general people, as for its government, there are those who send special commissioners to Manchuria and Mongolia every year to investigate the industry, and those who investigate the rich resources. The number of people they send is really no less than dozens of hundreds. From this, it can be seen that they pay attention to Manchuria and Mongolia, but it is close to our people. However, books on Manchuria and Mongolia can be regarded as abundant in Japan, and in our China they are really as rare as morning stars, and not valued by people. Then, the publication of this book recently compiled by Mr. Hua has considerable significance and value.</p>
<p>The whole book is about more than 100,000 words, and it can be regarded as the most abundant masterpiece for studying the Manchuria-Mongolia question. The content is divided into three chapters: 1. Geography of Manchuria and Mongolia, 2. Economy of Manchuria and Mongolia, 3. Diplomacy of Manchuria and Mongolia. Manchuria and Mongolia originally refer to the three northeastern provinces and Mongolia, because of the natural situation and artificial reasons, there are often special names such as South Manchuria, North Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, and Outer Mongolia. This has a close relationship with diplomacy. Based on this point, the author starts by explaining the geography of Manchuria and Mongolia. Everyone can know that Manchuria and Mongolia have vast land and sparse population, but the products are the richest and the transportation is the most developed, especially the prosperous trade. This, the author has a chapter on the economy of Manchuria and Mongolia, and at the same time, it can make us understand the development of Manchuria and Mongolia today. Of course, the diplomacy of Manchuria and Mongolia is even more important. There is an emphasis on the relationship between the two countries, such as China and Russia, and China and Japan, and there is a common relationship with the countries, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Germany. Therefore, the author divides the chapter on the diplomacy of Manchuria and Mongolia into three chapters: China and Russia and Manchuria and Mongolia, China and Japan and Manchuria and Mongolia, and the countries and Manchuria and Mongolia, to add detailed descriptions, so that we can understand the truth more easily after reading it.</p>
<p>The geography of Manchuria and Mongolia is described in two chapters, (1) Geography of Manchuria, which explains the location and name of Manchuria, "Manchuria is bounded by the mouth of the Ussuri River, the Songacha River, and Lake Khanka to the Russian Maritime Province in the east, by the Tumen and Yalu Rivers to the Japanese Korean peninsula in the south, by the Heilongjiang River to the Russian Amur Province in the north, by the Ergun River to the Russian Transbaikal Province in the northwest, and by the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea in the southwest. The total area is about 373,700 square miles." Although this describes the border and area of Manchuria, it can make us understand the relationship between Japan and Russia in Manchuria. At the same time, it has such a vast area. If our people never operate it, what kind of crisis will the future contain? In other words, the Japanese's attention to our Manchuria can show a glimpse of their ambition. (2) South Manchuria and North Manchuria. This is divided into two major parts according to the natural situation of Manchuria. North Manchuria has a vast area and a sparse population. The mountains and fields have the most trees. South Manchuria has a small area, but is rich in cultivated land. The population is large and the soil is fertile. However, after the Russo-Japanese War of Jia Chen, the two sides concluded the "Treaty of Portsmouth", and then stipulated that the Manchurian Railway south of Changchun was ceded to Japan. By the first year of the Republic of China, Japan and Russia concluded the second secret agreement, then dividing Manchuria south of Changchun as Japanese and Manchuria north of Changchun as Russian. Here, the sphere of influence of the two countries can be seen. Like this kind of historical fact, we need to know it in detail. (3) Kwantung State is also an important territory in the area, occupying the southern part of the Liaodong Peninsula and the nearby islands. Therefore, the author specially puts forward a separate discussion. The geography of Mongolia first explains the location and name of Mongolia, and then describes Inner Mongolia and Outer Mongolia, and lists detailed tables of their district names, tribe names, number of banners, and provinces included, so that readers can easily understand. Again, it describes eastern Mongolia and eastern Inner Mongolia, quoting Lin Daoyuan's "Study of the Situation of Eastern Mongolia" to explain its area in more detail.</p>
<p>The economy of Manchuria and Mongolia is described comprehensively. 1. Agriculture of Manchuria and Mongolia, A. Cultivated land and agricultural products of Manchuria and Mongolia, B. Soybeans, sorghum, millet, millet, wheat and miscellaneous grains, C. Cotton, tobacco leaves, sugar beet and peanuts, D. Orchards, E. Tussah silkworm industry, 2. Mining of Manchuria and Mongolia, A. Rich mineral products of Manchuria and Mongolia, B. Coal mines, C. Iron mines, D. Gold mines, E. Other minerals, 3. Forestry of Manchuria and Mongolia, 4. Animal husbandry of Manchuria and Mongolia, 5. Fisheries of Manchuria and Mongolia, 6. Currency of Manchuria and Mongolia, 7. Transportation of Manchuria and Mongolia, 8. Trade of Manchuria and Mongolia. The author has explanations and charts in each section, and the sub-sections are well-organized, which is one of the most complete chapters describing its economic scope.</p>
<p>The diplomacy of Manchuria and Mongolia is divided into three parts, upper, middle and lower. The upper part is China and Russia and Manchuria and Mongolia, 1. From Russia's eastward invasion to the Sino-Japanese War, 2. From the Sino-Japanese War to the Russian Revolution, 3. From the Russian Revolution to the establishment of the Russian Association, 4. From the establishment of the Sino-Russian Association to the present, the middle part is China and Japan and Manchuria and Mongolia, 1 From the Sino-Japanese War to the outbreak of the European War, 2. From the declaration of war against Germany to the establishment of the Japanese Tanaka Cabinet, 3. From the establishment of the Japanese Tanaka Cabinet to the present, the lower part is the powers and Manchuria and Mongolia. This part is more important than the previous two parts, so that we can understand the origin of the current precarious situation in Manchuria and Mongolia, and can arouse the vigilance of the people of the country and jointly seek strategies to save this declining situation. At the same time, the related relationship of these three countries can also be seen at a glance. The four appendices are especially for reference.</p>
<p>Mr. Hua's book is detailed in the preparation of Manchuria and Mongolia, which is worthy of attention.</p>
