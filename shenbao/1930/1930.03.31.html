<h3 id="c8">德新内閣成立 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>德内閣之新總理。已磪定爲加索里黨之白魯寗博士。加索里黨即主張宗敎主義之中央黨。屬右傾。以表面上言。此後之新政府。必將回復右傾。而據報載則謂白已變更主張。僅遴選志同道合者之共事。不復以各黨爲援。則將來政局。不致有何變動。亦未可知。倘若報載之言不磪。仍欲恢復右派得势时馬克思内閣之狀態。則糾紛可以立見。不難以從前經過之德政局證明之。</p>
<p>德自戰敗後名爲成立共和國。實宖人心思萬。民主主義。並未深入。萬萬派仍繼續活動。至一九二四年。左右兩黨。竸爭始烈。然選學結果。極右左兩方面均未得势。獨屬於右傾之中央黨。势力大増。至一九二七年馬克思出組内閣。以中央黨國權黨人民黨巴威人民黨等不相容之分子。聯立而成。馬本右傾。於是右派势力。始復興盛。其时因國權黨之專橫。中央黨宣布宗敎主張。又與人</p>
<p>民黨主張政敎分離者相爭。馬所標榜之聯立政策。完全不能實行。馬克思内</p>
<p>閣。即呈瓦解之势。延至一九二八年之初。德政局益形混亂。而左翼各黨。則結合漸固故是年總選壆之結果。右翼各黨。完全失敗。於是社會民主黨。起而代興。黨魁穆勒氏出組内閣。一變前内阁政策。其宣布行政方針中。主張對外以國際協調爲目標。反對一切危險觀念。爲最博内外之同情。由是左派用大占勝利。此雖由於右派内部之自起分裂。然亦爲世界潮流所必至。今者扼於一</p>
<p>時之財政問題而倒。但左翼势力。並未稍殺。。故白魯寗氏繼起組閣。中央黨果能覺悟以前六張之不相宜。國權黨之穩健者。果能覺悟舊分子之不相容而幡然變計。白氏果能自知積極傾右之不合於潮流所宣布之新方針。能取光明下大態度而不产以武斷政策。組織所謂有類奥意之强固有力政府。如此則白氏新内閣。或能相安而無事。否則政局糾紛。即將由斯而起。其關於德國命運之前途。蓋亦非細矣。</p>

<p>北平通信、此次河北礦務整理委員會在平開會、對於保障商礦辦法、於第二次大會時、議决由農礦廳擬具草案提交大會討論、旋經該廳擬具辦法四項、内分（一）救濟災礦、（二）減輕運費、（三）保護礦權、（四）擴充運路、提出第四次大會議决通過、轉呈省府核辦茲錄辦法如下、</p>
<p>（一）救濟災礦　河北省各商礦、比年因受戰事影響、採探工作、屢作屢輟疲敝不堪、查各省水旱爲災、向有缓徴或豁免丁漕成例、農産礦産、事屬相同、際茲訓政伊始、政尙寛大、允宜對於災礦酌加救濟、擬請將全省各礦、除現在出煤足以維持者外、凡曽直接受軍事影響現在停頓營業者、由農礦廳呈明省政府、分别情節、准予緩徵、或豁免區税一年至三年、並將原定採探期限、量予寛展、以示與民更始之意、</p>
<p>（二）減輕運費　查鐵路用煤定章、在民國十二年以前、每噸每公时運費○·○○六四二五銀元、（運章一百零二欵）自十四年以後改訂運章、即按新章第三十二欵收費、以平漢路由石家莊到鴨鴿營一叚而論、計程五十八公里、若照舊章計算、每噸運費合銀三角九分六釐、新章應收銀元一元零四分、　十八年九月調查是年平漢運費、較前増加約二倍有半、北寗路十五年以後、每公里亦改訂爲一分三釐七、較舊章加至二倍、據各礦商報告、各　自　費以善、　南路　本重　　、每年　額　形減少、鐵路收入亦隨減少、似此路礦交病、甚無謂也、擬請省政府商請主管部、將煤運收費量予減輕、以蘇商困、</p>
<p>（三）保護礦權　已領部照之礦、即係取得法律上之物權、地方政府即負保護之責、其業務之執行、礦權之行使、應予以充分之便制、如未違背現行法令、任何機關不得强利處分、或取銷其礦業權、至於私採小礦、最近損害一般礦商之利益、并應厲行禁止、擬請由政府明令佈告、以昭鄭重、</p>
<p>（四）擴充運路　河北省境内鐵路、平浦北寗偏東、平綏偏西、平漢一綫雖貫南北、但中部南部尙缺東西聯絡之綫、故井陘臨城磁縣三大礦區煤産銷路不廣、營業不振、連年軍運頻繁、平漢行車未能暢達</p>
<p>、正豐怡立中和各商礦銷路日蹙、賠累不堪、現當訓政時期、首重建設、以前倡辦之滄石順濟两路、均應即行興修、俾井陘磁數大煤田、可儘量開採、而各商礦之産額、亦必増加、本省税收自亦因而激増、擬請省政府催促主管部、將以上两路早日興工、若中央一時未能顧及、應由省集資先行開辦、</p>

<p>東京通信、日本自本年一月一日金解禁實施、社會上經濟上受莫大的影響、蓋金輸出旣得自由、金本位制度始能完成作用、而所謂金解禁之影響、即由此作用而起、例如貿易輸入超過、對外匯兑巿價低落、欲維持其不越過兑現點、必有大量正貨之流出、正貨之準備减少、通貨因以收縮、而物價必隨之下跌、物價旣落、則足以抑止輸入而促進輸出、如此經過相當時日、則對外匯率增高、而得以恢復平準的狀態、此金融之常道也、惟其間變動速度、不易一致、畸零偏倚、經濟上自不免發生衝動、並且恢復平準、惟生産豐裕的國家、得以運用自如、若物資貧困的日本、殊難辦到、故解禁之後、日本事前雖有節約預算、信用設定等相當的準備、仍不免要受重大的打擊、</p>
<p>據一般觀察、金解禁後之影響、不外輸入减少·正貨流出·通貨收縮·物價低落·巿况衰頽·數端茲將日本金解禁後之影響、槪述如次、（一）對外貿易、本年一月以降、日本對外貿易之輸出額、爲三億一千二百零七千元、輸入額爲三億九千四百六十七萬二千元、雖有八千二百七十四萬五千元之輸入超過、若與去年同期之入超額一億六千三百八十五萬四千元相較、却减少了八千一百十一萬元、並且三月上旬之入超、僅四百古七萬元、若準此推算、則日本本年度之貿易入超、只爲去年之半額、是金解禁及於貿易上之影響固不甚惡劣也、（二）正貨及通貨、解禁之後、因外國銀行紛紛收回在日本之資金、内地兑匯銀行、因在外正貨缺乏、而陸續兑現、截至二月十五日止、日本銀行之正貨準備、减爲十億萬元、二十日日本銀行結賬、僅有九億八千八百五十七萬元之現存正貨、爲最近十年來所未有之低額、兑換劵之發行額十一億五百九十八萬八千元、亦爲大正五年以來的最低記錄、綜合算之、自一月十一日兑換開始後、正貨之兑現額、逹一億六千四百萬元、以三井信託會社及三井三菱住友等銀行所兑出者爲大宗、内地兑現額之外、還有撥讓之在外正貨約七千萬元、是自金解禁後、僅及两月共失去正貨二億三千餘元、實出人預想之外、日本銀行兑換劵之發行已失其彈性、其統制金融之能力、殊屬可疑、這實在是金解禁後難以彌縫之破綻（三）巿况、金解禁後、社會一般經濟狀况、大呈衰頽氣象即日人所謂之「不景氣」、今春總選舉時、「景氣不景氣」、曾成爲政戰言論之主題、此「不景氣」之實質、可由民間一般存欵之增减證明之、依金融機關之統計、金解禁之後、民間存欵减少二倍、五千萬元、而各儲蓄機關皆設法以互相爭奪存欵、前此拒絶同業存欵者、今皆變爲歡迎、前此由同業定禁止行員勸誘存欵者、今皆秘密復活、其他各種股票、據東京證劵交易所之報告、皆大跌落、巿况之「不景氣」、甚形彰著、（四）物價、金解禁两月以來、巿面之扔價、因商人之把持與解禁前尙無大差、而農作生産品之價格、則大跌落、其中最露骨的爲絲價之暴跌、生絲爲日本輸出品之大宗、從事於其原料「繭」之生產者、達三百萬户、全係小農工階級、所以蠶絲在日本、國際貿易及國民經濟上、皆占有重要的位置、現在毎捆（百斤）降至千一百元、爲十年來未曾有之慘落、當局者以此是搖撼全　　界、施行補價損失補價法、决定　調　　價爲百九十元、融資額爲千二百元、此千二二百元之數、高出巿價百餘元、然比之生産原價、尙差一成、且該項補償法之規定、原是由昭和四年九月一日起、五年間之補償額、限定三千萬元、本届若補償二千萬元之損失、則嗣後四年之長期内、僅餘一千萬元、殊非安全之方法、</p>
<p>總之日本金解禁後、正貨流出·通貨收縮·人民之購買力减低·巿况呈衰頽之象、物價低落、生産者深蒙其害、凡事前預料的金解禁後之苦境皆不幸而中、由以上各節綜合觀之、日本金解禁後之影響、實屬惡劣、此種不良的結果、自然不能完全歸咎於金解禁、而其他原因尙多、例如美國財界之沉悶、印度關税之提高、中國銀價之暴跌等、「不景氣」已成爲國際的共通現象、惟日本之産業資本、係畸形的發逹、金解禁後、少數大資本家雖可獲一時之利、多數窮苦人民、則蒙莫大之害、加之日本原料之資源旣甚薄、貨物之販路又日促、通盤籌算、終是入不敷出、長此以往、前途深堪危懼、再者國内失業人數、逹三十餘萬窮苦的勞動者居其大半、至於智識階級之失業、尤爲可驚、計去年之求職者八萬二千三百人、僅八千四百餘人就職、失業者竟占十分之九、此實社會之病根、所謂「經濟國難」「思想國難」皆基於此、金解禁之後、更進一層的深刻化了、此種危機、其救濟之道、全在於當局者之誠意與努力、</p>

<h3 id="c90">本法草案及理由書大要 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>中國急不容緩之幣制改革、及在以全國統一之幣制、替代現今紊亂之通貨及採用金本位二者、一國之幣制紊亂、則於貿易及國家之發展興榮、均大有阻碍、今世界以銀爲本位之重要國家、厥唯中國、此項本位更予中國以莫大之打繫、尤以使其國外貿易及政府財政受害最大、國外貿易因以銀爲本位、遂易起紛擾、而政府全部之收入幾盡爲銀、然有一大部之支付則以金計算、故其財政之清理、遂以困難、</p>
<h3 id="c91">本金位之建議 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>本草案乃規定逐漸採用一種合宜之金匯兑本位制、並設法使現行種種貨幣永遠收回、而使中國有全國統一之金幣制、新幣制之單位、擬定名爲「孫」（Sun）、含純金六○·一八六六公毫、其價值及等於美金四○仙（二·五○孫幣等於美金一·○○元）、英金一仙令七·七二六五便士、日金○·八○二五圓、此項單位之擇定、大都因其在實際上以金爲計算、可與中國許多地方今日通行之銀幣同值、使現行銀單位改爲大槪價值相等之金單位、則物價工資及借貸關係均不致起擾動、即有擾動、亦至徴末、假如個人依現今標準、毎月收入爲一百元、則其人依改用之金標準計算、大槪仍爲一百孫、又一種物品在今日值一元者、在將來亦大槪值一孫、</p>
<p>本草案規定鑄造一孫、五角、二角等銀幣、一角五分等錢幣、一分、半分、二釐等銅幣、惟最小之銅幣、非有迫切之需要、則不鑄造、本草案於金幣之鑄造未予規定者、良以金本位無鑄造或流行金幣之必要、而今日多數金本位國家、亦無有以金幣作活動之流通者、惟本草案規定維持各種貨幣、與一固定金貨幣單位之平價、</p>
<p>並照下文所述、規定一種機械作用、使貨幣流通數量之增減、可與美英等國貨幣流通數量、因金貨實際輸出輸入之結果、而有增減者相同、因之此種制度、遂可具金本位之主要特質、而不必鑄造或流通金幣矣、</p>
<h3 id="c92">可以匯票兑回之信用貨幣 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>所有貨幣、包括孫幣在内、均爲信用貨幣、而由政府决擇以向各金本位國家之匯票或以金條、作無限制之兑回、以維持其與金幣之平價、本草案雖予政府以金條爲兑回之决擇權、惟此種兑回方式恐不能常見使用、</p>
<p>信用貨幣之兑回、尋常大槪用在紐約或倫敦支付之匯票、匯票之金額、應爲二千或二千以上之孫幣、毎次匯票須按由出票之中國城巿輸運金貨至受票之外國城巿所需費用、而徴收其匯水、假如中國有金幣流通而匯兑率逹於金貨輸出點、則輸出現金者亦須擔負與此項匯水相等之費用、凡用此種方法兑回之貨幣、實際停止流通、儼若離開國境、與有金幣流通之金本位國家情形相同、</p>
<p>在他方面、則規定一種等於現金輸入中國之辦法、而使在外國充中國代理處之某某銀行、出售以金本位貨幣在中國支付之匯票、其徴收之匯水、則與運現金至中國所需之運費相等、於是中國貨幣之增加、其成效乃與現金輸入中國相同、其匯兑之漲落、亦類有金貨幣流通之金本位贈家而止於金貨之輸出輸入點（ｇｏｌｄｐｏｉｎｔｓ）、藎中國常準備以外國金匯票交換其本國貨幣、又付出此項貨幣、以交換外國出售之外國金幣、而其交換率則與金貨輸出輸入點所定者相同也、此處所謂金貨輸出輸入點乃指在美英諸國、其匯兑率逹此點時、則輸出或輸入現金爲有利、</p>
<p>按照前述辦法、以兑回中國貨幣、及在國外出售以中國貨幣支付之匯票、須設立一金本位信託基金、此項基金、至少須逹流通貨幣價值百分之三十五、並分之爲二部、第一部基金包括現金及可付現金之外國匯票、第二部乃包括中國境内流通之金本位貨幣、及爲造幣目的所購之金屬、第一部基金存於二三外國金融中心、在開始時大槪僅存於紐約及倫敦、此項存欵之利息、歸中國政府所有、惟此部基金乃專供前述藉匯票以兑回中國貨幣之用、</p>
<p>第二部基金、包括中國貨幣、及供造幣廠目的之金屬、在有需要時、則用之爲新貨之來源、在通貨充斥應以匯票兑回時、則用之以收回通貨、因此第二部基金乃成爲一種緩衝基金能自動調整中國貨幣之供給、使合於貿易變遷之需要、第一部基金耗竭過多時、可因中國通貨之收縮而自動制止、兑回之中國貨幣、則劃入第二部基金内、而不發出、</p>
<p>基金及金本位由財政部幣制處管理、基金得由上海三種銀行公會、上海中國商會或中央銀行隨時審查、</p>
<h3 id="c93">造幣權利益 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>本草案規定之貨幣、均爲信用貨幣、故其所含金屬之數量、較其面值爲低、而政府鑄造貨幣、遂可得巨額造幣權利益、在金本位國家、除金貨幣外一切他種貨幣之實值與面值須相差頗鉅、否則銀銅等整之金價高漲時、其實值將較面值爲高、而有銷鎔以生銀銅出售之傾向、故貨幣之鞏固、遂以搖動、且有他種弊端發生、今</p>
<h3 id="c94">續嗣聖藥　男子九醜丸 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>

<p>以銀之現在價格爲基礎（一九二九年爲月）、規定一銀孫幣實值與面值之差約十三分之一、小貨幣之差則更大、尤以銀幣銅幣爲然、</p>
<p>假定中國毎人流通之銀幣等於美金一·八○元、又其流通之銀幣銅幣等於美金二六仙、則鑄造此等貨幣之造幣權利益、約可逹美金三三○·○○○·○○○元之鉅、若毎人之流通額較此爲大或小、則此項歸政府所得之造幣權利益亦隨之而大或小、據最近估計、印度毎人流通銀盧比之額、約等於美金三·五一元、而輔助貨幣或紙幣尙未包括在内、惟紙幣在印度較在中國爲重要、故吾人假定美金一·八○元爲中國毎人之流通額、似尙穏妥也、　　　　　　　　　　　　　（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c108">日本對遠東會田徑預測 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>可操必勝之劵······目空一切</p>
<p>織田幹雄譚話······國人請聽</p>
<p>二十三日東京通訊、日本早稻田大學田徑賽主將織田幹雄氏是日本田徑賽第一流選手、遠東大會中得第一位最鑫的第一名是菲律賓的加得倫氏、共得九次、織田氏就是第二名共得六次、他得跳遠第一二次、成績是七米○七○·三级跳遠二次、成績是十五米三五五、十項一次、成績是五五○四點、這都是遠東大會的記錄、</p>
<p>織田氏對於此次大會田徑賽有很詳細的談話、對於日本的實力磪有些根據、有許多足供吾人參考者、理面是織田氏的談話、</p>
<p>遠東運動會舉行以來、日本一年一年的進步、自第八次在上海獲得田徑錦標後、（指日本）强手更是倍出對於此次大會絶對樂觀、錦標全無問題、可是要包辦各項霸權、也還未可能、就實力説、歷届都很可觀、但有幾項却未曾得過一次優勝如短距離、跳高低欄、跳高是、這次定可别開生面、大槪的人才如下、</p>
<h3 id="c109">百米 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>短距離兢走自前年以來、雖有異常的進步、但此次仍免不了苦戰、百米最有希望的應推南部忠平氏、去年日德兢技時、以德國的强豪爲對手竟能獲得地位、不能不算是日本當今短距離中的第一人、其他大澤、阿武、西、吉岡、相澤、矢野諸氏、雖也是此中能手、却都難磪保十秒的記錄、若與菲軍相抗、終恐難有磪實的勝利、所以此項霸權此次或者仍得讓諸他人、</p>
<h3 id="c110">二百米 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>提到二百米、眞是濟濟多士、如大澤、中島、阿武、吉岡、西、矢野、相澤諸氏、他們都有二十二秒或更速的記錄、有這些能手、優勝可操左劵、而其中最有把握的是大澤、吉岡、中島三氏、大澤氏去年曾有二次逹到二十一秒六的記錄、吉岡、中島两氏同有奇妙的跑法、吉岡以百戰磨鍊的工夫、較中島君略勝一籌、两氏年事皆輕、爲日本效力的時候還多呢、</p>
<h3 id="c111">四百米 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>大阪的大會時納户氏曾獲過此項的優勝、他離去後、四百米一項就缺乏良才、及至昨年、才有中島氏得到近夫納户的記錄、可説四百米的進步、未免太弱了、中島氏若能逹到五十秒的記錄、四百米的優勝方有希望、可是現在還無把握、中島以外不少五十一秒的選手、但他們都無若何希望、</p>
<h3 id="c112">八百米 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>日本是中距離跑的常勝者、此次可不遇抵抗的獲得優勝、八百米第一流選手有朝鮮的久富氏满洲和濱田及國内的岡田、矢柴、高西諸氏、還有堪稱仲伯的藤木、倉西、木内等、大會此項的好記錄不多、因此更可望新進的出現、以上選手在日法、日德對抗兢技得了許多經騐、表現亦好、所以八百米的霸權、一定不能讓人、</p>
<h3 id="c113">千五百米 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>現在到底誰是此項兢技的第一人、很難判定、因爲實力相差很有限、從昨年的記錄看來、先可以把津田、北本、西、諸人舉出來、隨着有藤本、角谷、久富、西浦等、有這許多好手可預想日本的全勝、並待新記錄的産生了、</p>
<p>[P　&gt;一萬米</p>
<p>此項也是日本一向全勝的、此次自無問題、北本津田、森本、北角、楠諸人中誰是勝者、誰也不敢預説、永谷氏是此項記錄的保持者、將來他再突破自己的記錄是很有興味的一件事、</p>
<h3 id="c114">高攔 <a href="#c114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>高攔如短距離跑一樣、一向是失敗的、可是今年應另目相視了、歐洲的霸者德國尙不能破的三木氏、一定能將榮冠拿到日本來、比三木氏雖大遜、但是隨着的還有黄島、鶴岡、岩永等人、不待三木出塲、這班好手的活躍、已可有很好的成績、</p>
<h3 id="c115">低欄 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>二百米低欄有從今年起改爲四百米的消息、所以對於此項的預想是難的、日本的選手長谷川、黄拍木田中真山木諸氏採用此種競技的日子尙淺很有些不利、這可説是過渡時期難免的現象、</p>
<h3 id="c116">跳高 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>跳高是全兢技中最須苦戰并努力的一種、因爲菲軍的多利比阿氏很是可怕、他在和闌的世界大會曾以四等當選、且有一米九五的記錄、木村氏雖有一米九四的記錄、實力也在多利比阿氏以上、可是却被他赢過两次不免有此心怯能、木村此次旣有家鄉的地利、自然抱必勝的决心去苦鬥、可是對方也要死守着他原有的地位、這两雄的爭霸是大會唯一有趣的可注目的、两人中無論誰勝、大槪一定會産生世界的記錄、隨此两雄之後、有小野能勢人、至能越過一米八○的人爲數更多、再看小野氏在日德兢技的奮鬥、無論如何是無問題的、</p>
<h3 id="c117">跳遠 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>南部氏在此項的奮鬥、恐怕不是爲東洋霸權之爭、實在説起來他是全世界的第二位、卑成一位世界選手了、隨着這位世界選手的、雖然有些貧</p>
<h3 id="c118">上海女籃球選手梁麗芳與體育協進會總幹事郝伯陽請託　　（林澤民君攝） <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p></p>
<p>弱樣子、但也還有富山、大島、中島、西村等氏曾憶在上海大會時此項被一位没有想到的選手爭了第二、若是以上諸氏果能現出實力作一鳴驚人舉之、全勝也不是不可能的、</p>
<h3 id="c119">撑高跳 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>日本今年在此項的勝利是確定的、西田氏的跳要漸與世界記錄爭霸了、越過二米七○的高度就有全勝的可能性、望月、金盛、山本、淺井、森諸人的奮鬥、將給日本以莫大的光榮、</p>
<h3 id="c120">三級跳遠 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>此項兢技的優勝早已不成問題了、老資格的有南部、大島、富山、柴田諸氏、再從現來漸露頭角的木村、西田两人中、無論選出誰來、就可成全勝的局面、居第一位的除去南部氏外、自然是木村、西田两氏、</p>
<h3 id="c121">鉛球 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>日本鉛球的獲勝是毫無疑議的、投手高田氏的實力已是萬人所認的、這自然是他長久苦心的報酬、鉛球的重量將由十二磅增爲十六磅、隨著高田以下、就有齋藤、青野、内田、石田諸氏、菲軍的實力雖不得而知、至少也是相當的、若要在此項得到地位　必逹到十三米的記錄方有希望、</p>
<h3 id="c122">鐵餅 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>板橋、齋藤氏雖確能超過四十米的遠度、冲田、富田、黑田、久内、關田等也有突破四十米的可能前年來日的一位軀幹短小的法國選手能投四十六米、日本選手也有此種可能、</p>
<h3 id="c123">標槍 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>此項兢技、日本有全勝的可能性、第一位當推住吉氏更有管沼、伊藤、山本、家永、阿部、宇佐美、西村等人、須有五十五米以上記錄的人才有</p>
<h3 id="c124">昨晨上海女選手（右）王大樂（左）蕭嘉珍啟程時、在北站報到、　（林澤民君攝） <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>資格來與他們對抗、在上海大會時、住吉氏雖獲勝、但其他諸人却都落選了、這是日本不甘心的、日本若能有超過六十米者四人、那就不但爲遠東的霸者也可也出而爭雄世界、</p>
<h3 id="c125">五項運動 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>遠東大會的規則是五項、十項及結力賽跑合算爲</p>
<p>一錦　、其餘的田徑賽又爲一錦標、所以對於五項、十項兢技是不能忽視過去的、在五項運動活躍的人才有昨年初次出塲而獲勝的住吉氏、其他有藤口、黑田石橋諸氏、此項兢技每國可有六人出塲、可是日本在以上四氏外、現在找不出别人來、早大的家永伊藤、慶大的板橋諸氏、若是在千五百米一項再强一點、加入五項、一定能成功、</p>
<h3 id="c126">十項運動 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>十項同五項一様、大槪勝利都歸日本的、齊、西田、小山、衣川、山縣諸氏最有希望、在上海大會也得了一二位、何况此次更有地利、所以夢想全勝也不是不能的事、特别西田的活躍將來定居日本第一位無疑、</p>
<h3 id="c127">八百米接力 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>短距離的人才旣多、結力跑就可確得優勝、關於八百米結力跑、預定是日本優勝、並可望新記錄的産生大澤、吉岡、中島、西、阿武、南部、矢野是此項的中堅、最令人生憾的是村山氏病後不能出塲、他曾將阿武、西等强豪離開五米的距離而作十秒六的高記錄、若有他出塲、二百米一項的優勝也很容易到手、</p>
<h3 id="c128">千六百米接力 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>在這種兢技、日本僅有四百米選手的中島氏的一人、所以不免要苦戰一番、可是接力跑不是單靠速度能預定勝利的、必有「人和」才有勝利、雖然如此説、就上次上海的敗看來、此次大槪仍是别人的勝利、</p>
<p>記者按織田前因兢技、致足部受傷、現已日就痊愈、此次或能出席大會、他的拿手是跳遠三級跳遠、三級跳遠十項運動、在以上他提到的選手外、自然要加上他自己、</p>

<p>— 羽盦</p>
<p>吾國幅員至廣。凡二十餘行省。縣治則幾逹二千以上。殆無人能一一舉其縣名也惟三國時代之地名。則雖三尺童子。但能讀三國演義。或竟目不識丁。僅熟觀三國時代之京戲者。亦必知之。如湖北之當陽縣。以長板坡一劇而著。湖南之長沙縣。以關羽戰黄忠而著。四川之綿竹縣。以諸葛瞻死節而著。又劍閣縣。以張邰中伏而著。他如閬中天水華容公安各縣。無不爲國人津津樂道。方之今日。則猶浙江之奉化溪口。雖爲一小鎭巿。知者極尠。因産生蔣介石之故。名乃大彰。蓋即所謂地以人傳也。今愚所記耒陽。亦爲三國時代有名之一地。與當陽長沙同爲膾炙人口。歷千萬𥜥而不衰者。</p>
<p>耒陽。漢所置。至元升爲州。明仍爲縣。清屬湖南衡州府。民國三年袁府之内務部重定行政區域。改屬湖南衡陽道。今則道制廢。直接爲湖南之一縣矣。其能膾炙於人口者。則以三國時代龐統曾宰是邑。又得張桓侯一度蒞臨之故。至今耒陽猶留有龐張遺跡。保存不朽。最著者爲鳳雛亭（龐號鳳雛）及石鑿馬槽。亭在縣政府之後。已歷千數百年。漸就傾圯。民國十三年陳梓嘉君任該縣知事。慮其湮没。特捐廉修葺之。始復舊觀。有聯云。百里原非棲鳳所。一時權作臥龍岡。頗工整貼切。馬槽則爲桓侯遺物。相傳龐至縣不理事。先主怒。遣桓侯視察。即鑿槽飼其代步焉。槽長四尺許。寛尺五。深祇尺餘。雕有花紋甚細。春旁並建一碑。刻曰。邈矣桓侯。志秉千秋。石槽飼馬。遺愛猶留。忠貞不朽。神與物侔。曠懹古代。遐想悠悠。又洗馬池一。與馬槽及鳳雛亭成虯鼎足式。則爲當時桓侯洗馬之所也。吾友某君爲愚談吉此。某君蓋曾親履其地者。夷考正史。龐統爲三國蜀漢襄陽人。字士元。司馬徽稱爲南州士之冠冕。先主使守耒陽。不治。魯肅曰。士元非百里才。使處治中别駕之任。始得展其驥足耳。先主召爲治中從事。從入蜀。爲流矢所中。卒。演義稍異。謂統蒞縣數月。但飮酒。醉則高臥。桓侯來。猶衣冠不整。扶醉而見。桓侯責其有辱君命。幾不免。龐乃於數小時内處理積案。曲直分明。無一冤者。桓侯驚服。史則直書其不治。不管爲南轅而北轍也。雖然。其曾宰耒陽。非如其他歷史遺跡之大都無稽。則可斷然確定矣。</p>
<h3 id="c144">陳嘉庚軼事 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— 黄寄萍</p>
<p>南洋華僑陳嘉庚氏。爲當代最熱心敎育者。亦僑胞在海外投資最雄厚之實業家也。陳氏昔以橡皮事業起家。擁資數千萬。彼不願效世所鄙棄之守財奴。爲子孫積孽財。亦不忍祖國敎育事業之衰頽。而文化益落後。遂倡「敎育救國」之説。願斥私産。爲祖國文化努力焉。余居厦數載。關於陳氏之言行。耳聞目擊。知之甚稔。摭述一二。以實自由談。</p>
<p>陳氏旣抱「敎育救國」之决心。二十年來。未嘗稍懈。今日名聞全國之集美學校。厦門大學。即其理想中成功史之一頁也。集美爲幼稚院·小學·幼稚師範·男女中學·農·商·水産等八校集合體之總稱。崇樓大厦。黌舍櫛比。已成優美之學村。厦門大學内分文·理·敎·法·商五學院。名流碩産。薈集於此。設備建築。俱臻上乘。綜計該两校所費。已近千萬。内祗僑胞慨助三十餘萬耳。夫閩南華僑之擁巨資如陳嘉庚者。何止數十。其能慨解義囊。樹百年大計者。陳氏一人而已。</p>
<p>或有詢陳以辦學之本旨者。則曰「平生素願。别無希求。蓋錢由我來。亦當由我去。」語重心長。深足玩味。年來樹膠跌價。其所營事業。不如往昔之盛。目前每月贏餘祗十萬。而提半數爲两校常費。吁。可謂豪矣。憶當年厦大發生學潮。遷延不决。陳　氏鄭重表示曰。「合則留。不合則去。焉用强求。厦大雖留一生一徒。亦當照常進行。决不因此而阻余辦學之心志。」卒至一部分敎授與學生。自動離校。學潮平靜。生徒鋭減。而該校進行如故。</p>
<p>陳氏秉性慈祥。前年其星洲總廠之一部。被燬於火。失業工人千餘。衣食不濟。陳氏特准照常支薪。歷四月始恢復。未嘗有吝色。其總廠各部工員逾五千。陳身任總理。而終年辛勤。無異工人。且自命爲工頭。每晨八時進廠。巡視各部。舉凡機械之原理與運用。率皆諳熟。晩至六時始返寓。人謂其先工人入。後工人出。莫不憚勞。不畏難之精神。殊堪敬佩也。</p>
<p>星洲一埠。陳氏所營實業至夥。橡皮·糖果·藥材·鞋帽·其尤著者。陳嘉庚公司遍設全球。計共四十八處云。</p>

<p>自西雅圖起程。沿途鐵路派員蘐送。并特加一車。毎日皆有路員請吃飯。車　中屢</p>
<p>接各方慰問歡迎之電報。抵芝加哥時。鐵路公司總理華商總會梅氏公记各報館記者均來歡迎。並欲挽留一日。婉辭始已。當即轉車赴紐約。到站有總領事華商總會及各公會各團體代表在站歡迎。又有華僑小學校學生數百人。齊唱特製歡迎之歌。各報館派來攝影者凡十餘家。時站台觀衆逹數千人之多。特闢一路。以繩界之。派巡警六人護送。甫出月台。　門即閻。直至各人歡送登車後。方再啟門。以免擁擠也。巡警沿途照料。送登總領事汽車。收到所贈鮮花六十餘束。車上插中美國旗。睕華乘之。至巴拉薩飯店。Ｐｌａｓａ　Ｈｏｔｅｌ報館訪員撮影記者一時蝟集。梅氏代表十餘人來。照料一切。纷擾移時。始獲休息。</p>
<p>自抵此間。有各團體各大名角邀往觀劇。或觀排演。皆極表歡迎。拜辣斯魯君Ｂｏｌａｓｒｏ乃劇界泰斗。時因患病。特由病院中來信歡迎。極表崇拜之意。其餘各城名伶來信亦甚多。劇界中有數人願盡義務帮忙者。如卡瓦爾君Ｅａｔｌ　Ｃａｗｒｌｌ係一大戲園主。特來安置燈光。毫不受酬。如此種種殊難枚舉。盛意固可感。亦於以見美人歡迎之狂熱也。</p>
<p>自睕華前日出台後。觀衆無一不满意者。第一齣汾河灣。只演進窰後一段。演完後衆大鼓掌。呌籠Ｃｕｒｔａｉｎ　Ｃａｌｌ到五次。第二齣青石山。朱桂芬與　連榮合演。朱演畢下塲。亦頗受歡迎。第三齣盜盒。睕華僅舞劍一段。呌簾五次。因又演一段。休息十分鐘後。梅與連榮演剌虎。尤受歡迎。呌簾至十五次之多。洵爲劇塲罕見之盛况。贈花籃者數十處。此次以汾河灣剌虎二劇奏偉大之成功。實爲快事。蓋中國固有忠貞義勇之美德。略備於斯。尤足顯中劇之眞精神也。尤有可注意者。台下對於中國音樂皆極稱讚。次日各報皆有好評。如泰晤士報Ｔｉｍｅｓ向不注意戲劇者。此次忽標評論。竟占两大行之多。又如紐約世界報Ｎｏｗ　Ｙｏｒｋ　Ｗｏｒｌｄ云。梅氏之劇我只能了解其百分之五。就其所知者言之。尙不敢認爲無誤。然甫觀三分鐘後。則已極满意云云。</p>

<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>安特萊竇朗Ａｎｄｕｅ　Ｄｅｒａｉｎ（Ｄ）</p>
<p>「所有一切埃及的。希臘的。意大利文藝復興期的作品都「是」的。値得我崇拜的。近代的成千成萬的作品却不是了。至於我們同時代的作品。暫不論。</p>
<p>最初。大家都不原諒竇朗的古典的寫實主義。這種古典的寫實主義。不外是對於自然的愛。他一生探求自然的秘義。努力畫那綠奥的眞相。莫奈的畫風景。裹面祗看見蒙着日光的花草。竇朗畫風景便是那自然自身的根本表白。他的畫靜物。第一印象是結構堅實的感情。我們對着他的果實。瓦鉢。一片破布。都不但是種描想藉寫却像那建築房屋一樣正確的。科學的組織起來—那裹只是物質的美。他想藉着「面」的對比底配合而在畫面上顯出立體之感來。以二十世紀的最初的二十五年的舊學理所從出的批評。埋怨他侮蔑了一輩大師。摹擬一種原始的作風。但是他的返原的意見只是和那優柔的藝術的陳腐下去的形式—那一切模倣性的趨於遊移無定的感情相衝突。總之野獸派和立體派對於美學的感覺。彼此都是象徵主義的。這種象徵主義初在文學上發現。隨後也走到繪畫上來了。以前畫家主張的是對於自然外霰的類似。等價和隱喻。這種空泛的智力主義。因爲過於主觀和抽象。或者更將增加繪畫界的紊亂。</p>
<p>竇朗爲恢復繪畫中已經喪失了的客觀性。把純粹的繪畫的傳統再行接合起來。這種傳統是逐漸被裝飾的奇幻所消滅殆盡的。</p>
<p>凡是滯在巴黎研究文藝的人們。無論是維。總要着眼於竇朗的生涯。他是於一千八百八十年。六月十日生於霞渡Ｃｈａｒｏｕ。幼年時受過一切很完全的敎育之後。再預備投攷高等工藝學校。想將來成就一個工程師。但是用數學來解析時間與空間這一類的抽象東西。很不適合於氣質太過人質的竇朗。終於他就爲繪畫甩吸引了。他也如一切天才一樣。早慧得可驚。十五歲已經創作了許多畫。他是很傲視一切的。後來野獸派和立體派的問題發生之時。他曾經挺起身子説過：「我曾經較之别人理是立體······」</p>
<p>是的。他二十年前的作品。在巴黎到處還可以看到。的確是立體的。比别人更是立···但是在於他。從没有—從自由製作上奪去生命。使成了硬化的立體的敎義。在現代歐洲的藝壇的大人物。能夠承傳塞尙的眞義。而開出新的出發點。做藝術史上正系的詛師的。大槪就是竇朗能。</p>
<p>因爲他住霞渡。所以在少年時期就認識了佛拉孟克。佛拉孟克是他的隣人。也就變成了他最相契的畫家了。有一個時竇朗曾經常常在迦利哀Ｃａｒｒｉｅｒｅ的畫室。有時還有些地方含着迦利哀的秘密。後來認識了Ｍａｔｉｓｓｅ，　Ｍａｒｑｕｅｔ，　Ｂｒａｑｕｅ　Ｄｕｆｇ，　Ｆｒｌｅｇｅ等。結合起來組織了野獸派以反</p>
<p>抗印象主義的繪畫現代歐洲美上一切的新　　都是本着「反印象主義」的精神發生出來的。</p>

<p>島國相逢恨晚　有台灣女子林阿寳者、現洋廿三歲、出自名門、十餘歲時以家境貧困、隨鄰婦出走東灜、居於大阪、後因環境不良、淪爲妓女、難欲自振人格、奈以身入平康、無緣而遇恩客、終日鬱鬰、無非自嘆薄命而已、曾去年有張良卿者、人爲甬産、經商日本某熱水瓶廠、張姓謀業他鄉、絶少知己、因之涉足花叢、遂與阿寳邂逅、異國相逢、一見如故、頗恨晤面之晚也、</p>
<p>鴛鴦各自分飛　林阿寳旣遇張良卿後、两情繾綣、擬訂白首之約、如是者數年於茲、感情甚洽、後阿寳以家事關係　、别張而赴台灣、張亦無意在異鄉營業、及歸故國、詎料野合鴛鴦、此後各自分飛、林女於居家數月、復歸日本、不見情人踪跡、心頗詫異、自思張或懷我、恐有台灣之行、遂又束裝而返故居、豈知人影杳然、徒呼負負、</p>
<p>携細軟而來滬　張良卿旣歸故國後、卜居南巿九畝地、念及戀人林阿寳、不無滄桑之感、遂至函電紛飛、頻向日本問訊、林得張函後、喜其情人已有着落、所謂踏破鐵鞋無覓處、提來全不費工夫、立刻携其私蓄千餘元、束裝來滬、并有行囊三件、一爲皮包一及舗蓋、其一則係籐籃也、</p>
<p>旅邸重叙幽情　林于廿五日來滬後、寄寓六馬路跑馬廳某大飯店五樓五二七唬、來時衣服華麗、舉止端莊、髪作西洋式、身御短旗袍、足登高跟革履、視之一儼然贵貴族婦人、闢室之後、手持紙條、即飭該店茶房往九畝地某處呼張姓客來、正在此時、而所謂張良卿者、衣服亦頗入時、昂然而入、久别重逢、益爲歡洽　、</p>
<p>愛情頓現破裂　林張闢室之後、愛情異常濃厚、茶房等時見其两人携手而去、並肩而歸、態度甚爲鎭靜、及至二十七日、因嫌室小、復移至五三六號房間、不料移室之後愛情頓現破裂、室中時起爭吵之聲、侍者等以其形同夫婦、漫不注意、然其爭吵之點、以隔窗聞之、不外乎金錢两字、實不知三日之間、即有慘不忍睹之事發生矣、</p>
<p>黑夜赤足跳樓　林阿寳以張良卿、時有不情之舉、深悔不該遠道而來、並願終身相許、張因家有前妻、不敢犯此重婚罪名、完全拒絶其請、聲言昔在日本之時、曾於阿寳身上、化去洋蛈千元、此次携欵來滬畢還、前晚十時、俩即閉門而臥、亦無何種舉動、不料昨晨二時零十分、林阿寳不知何故、僅披單衣、赤足而赴洋台、氣憤跳樓、黑夜迷濛中、竟有此等慘事、</p>
<p>美人香消玉殞　林女由五樓洋台墜下、高至六丈、以其玉膚粉肌、豈能受此重創、而五三六號之洋台、面臨雲南路、此時人聲寂寂、途上頓現凄凉之景、林阿寳墜樓之後、鼻已削去其半、渾身粉碎、腸肺立斷、血肉糢糊、慘不忍觀、後由崗捕車送仁濟醫院、延至昨日上午十時、遂香消玉殞、</p>
<p>捕房調查眞相　老閘捕房得該店司事報告後、以此案事出離奇、大有研究價值、立飭探員趕往該店五樓五三六號房間、入内見張良卿正在好夢方圓、推其蘇醒、竟不知所云、捕房因其嫌疑頗大、恐有謀財害命之舉、將其拘押捕房、定今晨解送法院候審、聞張良卿在滬已别有所眷、香檳旅館中有一甬妓、與張亦情好異常、並訂嫁娶、張亦爽約、該妓憤而吞烟、雖未慘死、要亦最近之事也、</p>

<h3 id="c226">青春的悲哀 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 時鐸</p>
<p>當着這個感覺提到我的腦海裹時、我不知怎地就非常難過、心頭猶如刀刺一般、雖然我的境遇並不太幸福、可也不會不舒服、在日間、我曾忘情地大笑着、然而一到夜裹、我的心情就會頽萎、夜的沉默引我到幻想的國土裹去、「青春將要離你而去了、這幾年裹頭、過去的是否你</p>
<p>均覺到满意、你你曾做下些什麽加厚生命的事體、要知道過去是將來發展的基礎啊、你要耐心地把它捉住、也許前途的渺茫可因之减輕一分、」不知好幾回我曾惘然地想着、然而、這様想着有什麽結果呢、除了當時得到一個哀感外、還有什麽呢、我不能回答了、</p>
<p>我不怨天、我也不尤人、委實生命所</p>
<p>給與我的創傷、並没有多過許多旁人、何况還有幾次它很體貼地撫慰過我照理、我應該沉醉在於歡樂之谷、謳歌着青春的榮華、然而我偏不能、我偏要自尋煩惱、偏要投入悲哀的深谷裹、原因是我生性喜深思遠慮、思慮的結果、便是樂趣少而苦惱多、據有經騐者談、這様思慮若得以夢想來調劑、便可以馳神騁志、自覺愉快無倫、因爲思想太痛苦了、夢　想乃减少此中的枯燥生活、然而、這是可能嗎、當你瞥見眼前的一片黑漆、和將來的渺茫、你正憂慮不暇、何有心情來夢想呢、唉、可憐的現代的人生、更可憐的是青春的早年、就連夢想也没有暇晷了、</p>
<p>所以在現在、我只覺得眼前的悲哀、與預見將來的暗礁而擔憂、</p>
<p>説來連我自己也莫明其妙、竟不知從什麽時候起、我竟每晚非到十二點鐘以後就不瞌眼、而且每夜都免不了要失眠、當着我從酣睡中驚醒時、靜聽着四周前後的夜的沉寂、和一两聲凄厲的從工廠裹發出來的哀叫、的賣點心的呼喚、愈使我感到孤獨、愈沉入深沉的悲哀中了、唉、青春雖足留戀、可也足使人凄然悲哀「永久满足的人生、實在不可得了、」原來是如此啊、</p>
<p>在我這様晦暗的心情中、顯然的還有一種勢力把我纏住、這個是鄉愁、原來一個人爲了前途的奔浪、或者其他的勾當、不惜離鄉背井、來走到人生生疎的地方去作客、在這時期、要是衣豐食足、長是歡樂榮華的日子、平日固然不會發生什麽愁、但是如果遭逢了其麽不如意的事實、或者本人是有幾分悲觀色彩的、</p>
<p>那就難免要顧影自憐、當着深夜人睡後、舉頭凝望天上的雲和月、那有不凄然涙下、悠然沉醉於鄉愁之谷的、啊、這個Ｎｏｓｔａｌｇｉｄ是具有多麽大的魔力呀、我近日的心境、從青春的悲哀之外、又飄飄然跌入愁鄉裹了、</p>
<p>顯然的、只要那琴聲刺入我的耳朶、我便想着鄉裹的一切、我爲雙親的一片苦心而落涙、我爲姊姊的死亡而悲傷、更有那···一切的、一切的、我不忍説了、總之、我現在是爲愁苦所包圍中了、</p>
<p>唉、神秘的夜去了、又是現實的白盡、耀眼的陽光去了、又是神秘的夜、這樣往後循環着、我不知在幾時才可以跳出眼前的悲哀、現在、和煦的春風開始吹彿了、連綿的春雨也將降臨了、只可憐我還是在那裹悲哀、</p>
<h3 id="c227">校内學術團體組織的新趨勢 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>講到學術團體的一様東西、在她的組織、方面、自然應當處處地顧念着、如何地組織才可便於學術的研究、而她的工作方面、尤其是更應謀事實上的學術探討、因爲感覺着學業無窮、人壽有限、即一人專心致志、盡畢生之精力去研究一門學術、在事實上也來不及、所以就不得不求聯合志同道合的同志們、來組織一個學術團體、共同研究、相互報告、想在較短的時期内、收較大的成績、因之就有學術團體組織的發紉、面羣起採用、這種組織的雛形、以在大學及專門學校中爲更多、每每踏進一個學校、在許多的告白中、我們至少總可以找得到一两　張學術團體的佈告、政治學會啊、經濟學會啊、敎育研究會啊、以及ＸＸ文藝社啊、各色俱備不勝列舉、的確是熱閙、</p>
<p>但因太熱閙了、就被一般野心家、一般想出風頭的同學們看中、以爲假使做了這些團體的職員的話、那自然可藐視一切、大可完成其風頭思想而一般野心家、含有色彩背景的同學們、更看清了學術團體是能引起同學的同情、而隨便來參加、就可達他們的目的、騙得純粹的同學加入了他們的圈套、這様一來、就漸漸地漸漸地純潔的學術團體名義及組織、也弄得烏烟瘴氣、一變而爲衆目所屬的風頭舞臺、甚至名爲文藝社、而一查其實、則係某派小組的變相、</p>
<p>我們的発學校——大夏大學内的學術團體的組織、何能逃出例外、據我曉得的如有相當歷史的某某文藝社、何常不是某某份子小組的變相、新近發起的某某文藝社、何常不是某某同鄉會的換形、他如某某學會啊、被某某派所把持包辦着、此外我還曉得一件有趣的事實、某人因没有當選某學會的職員、致不能達到他的風頭機會、他竟老羞成怒、要退出該會、總而言之、統而言之、所有學術團體的組織、差不多都成了各黨各派的營寨、風頭主義者的目的物、在每次的改選中、也都各盡所能、竭力地豎起各自的旗幟、碰命爭奪、而事實上旣是如是、自然就早把學術探討的表面宗旨、也抛到九霄雲外去了、外表上充满着學術團體的空氣的學府、但身在其中者、祇覺得不知所之、澈底的説一句、實在是不亞於一國之内的政黨、幸而新近得到一個差强人意的趨向、我校的負責人員及較爲清醒的一部份同學、都瞭解了校内已有之學術團體的内容及其弊害、也知道已有之學術團體的主持者的用意、所以就感覺得要眞正地做到些學術研究的實際、就不得不先來　廢除形式上的組織、打破野心家的迷夢、什麽委員啊、主席啊、一槪廢之不用、自然就没有風頭可給他們出、機會可給他們利用了、此種組織的新趨向、在夏中已在進行者、有社會學會和經濟學會两個、牠們是絶無職員的推選、負責人是輸流擔任的、召集的方式、是彼此負責、以口頭相告、在這次的會議中、共同來决定下次的日期和地點、并决定研究的題目及負責報告者、這两個團體的實現、時間雖則是不久、雖也不能把牠的成續、報告出一些來、但至少可足自傲的一點、其中組織的份子、關於抱着風頭思想而參加的、以及想利用團體而行其目的的、完成其目的的一般野心家、總算是不拒而絶了、這種方法的是否完善、是否能收得差强人意的結果、自然還得看將來的事實、總之、這是一種新的趨向、新的趨向是值得注意的、是值得費心去栽培的、也是值得報告出、作學術團體的組織的參考、</p>

<p>交大自開女禁、已有三年的歷史了、男女同學的界限、雖然不能説完全打破、可是在斜陽西下的時候、草塲上也常常有男女同學在一處、或是拍網球、或是打排球、華燈初上的時候、女生宿舍的會客室裹、也常常有男同學和女生坐在長桌的两旁、或是研究功課、或是談談笑笑、這两個的例子、就可以證明他和她們、並不是十分隔閡的了、</p>
<p>向來祇有男生到女宿舍來找他的朋友、没有女生到男宿舍找她的男友的、而且他到女宿舍、祇要在十一點熄燈以前、隨便什麽時候、都可以的、絲毫不受舍監干涉的、現在訓育處因爲女生宿舍會客室太小、讀書的人過多、人聲嘈雜、不能專心研究課本、所以規定晚間八時以後、男生不可再至女宿舍、倘然在八時以前、已　在那處、那末時鐘一鳴八下、女舍監就跑到會客室來、用着逐客的眼光、來射到他們身上、跑來跑去、跑了好幾次、雖然他們不願走、受了她可怕的眼光、也不得不走了、</p>

<p>「喬治克里蒙梭」、他的朋友回答他、</p>

<p>(Hangzhou) Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, arrived in Ningbo at 3:30 AM by the Yin-Feng train, then transferred by boat. At 10:35 AM, Jiang Qian, Zhang Chengjiang, Shen Shiyuan, Zhu Jia'ao, Chen Bulei, Zhou Xiangxian, and others went to welcome him. He boarded a car and went directly to Chiang's villa for rest. In the evening, Zhang held a banquet at Laiyin Villa. Chiang stayed at Chiang's villa. Dai Jitao and Yang Xingfo also arrived. (30th Dispatch) Ningbo Chairman Chiang and Soong Mei-ling arrived in Ningbo from Fenghua at 9 AM this morning and took a special train to Hangzhou. They plan to inspect the training corps at Wufu. The Chu Tai and Jian Kang warships left Ningbo for Shanghai on the same day. (30th Dispatch) Shaoxing Chairman Chiang reviewed the troops at Wufu on the 30th.

He Yingqin originally planned to go to Hangzhou to attend the opening ceremony of the National Games, but this has been canceled due to Chairman Chiang's delayed return to Nanjing.

<h3 id="e2">Central Propaganda Department Sends Telegram to Party Headquarters in Various Locations <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Stating the Central Government's Attitude Toward Yan and Feng</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the matter of Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang, the Central Propaganda Department telegraphed party headquarters in various locations on the 30th, stating: Previously, Yan Xishan repeatedly issued circular telegrams filled with fallacies, which were refuted by comrades in party headquarters at home and abroad and criticized by national leaders. He realized that the public will of the people could not be defied and his own selfish desires could not be satisfied. Therefore, in order to ease the atmosphere, he declared his resignation and intention to go abroad, in order to divert the attention of the people. However, in secret, he prepared for military action, accumulated wealth and provisions, purchased weapons and ammunition, and colluded with reactionary forces in the hope of undermining peace and unity, inflicting even greater wounds on our hard-working and exhausted people. This is evidenced by the news that he released Feng Yuxiang on the 8th of this month, allowing him to return to Shaanxi to command the Northwest Army in an attempt to rebel. His ruthless ambition is even more exposed. Yan Xishan's insidiousness and deceit, disregarding good faith, have long been abandoned by the people. His military strength is also very weak. Knowing that he is not capable of causing chaos and that rebellion is difficult, he did not hesitate to trick Feng Yuxiang into joining him, in order to increase his reactionary momentum. Yan recently claimed that he and Feng Yuxiang would go abroad together, but this is merely a cover-up of what has been heard. However, while Yan is cunning, Feng is even more so than Yan. Yan wants to use Feng to help him, but Feng wants to use Yan as a sacrifice. They have different dreams in the same bed, how can they unite? Moreover, their old grievances and new grudges are intertwined and accumulated. The emotional rift may be insignificant, but the conflict of interests is inevitable. Since their respective backgrounds and motivations are different, there is no possibility of cooperation. This is from the standpoint of Feng and Yan as feudal warlords. They will certainly not truly unite. Even if they do unite, they will inevitably end in mutual destruction, eliminating the remaining poison of feudal ideology. Therefore, our party believes that their rebellion is actually beneficial to the future of the revolution. We hope that their rebellious actions will be revealed as soon as possible, so that they can be eradicated as early as possible. At present, the Central Government still adheres to its original intention of peace and an attitude of magnanimity, hoping that Yan and Feng will be moved to reform. If they do not know how to repent and continue to raise troops and make trouble, intentionally invading, then the Central Government, in order to implement the policy of peaceful reunification and to stop internal strife to ensure the security of the party and the country, will naturally carry out a punitive expedition to resolve the issue entirely. It is hoped that party headquarters in various locations will understand this intention and engage in propaganda. (30th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e6">Yan and Feng Are Not Very Harmonious <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Peiping Garrison Headquarters telegraphed from Peiping on the 30th: (1) Yan telegraphed to urge Feng to take the false position of Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, but Feng has not yet expressed his position. The Northwest Army generals still refer to Feng by the title of Commander-in-Chief. (2) Yan is taking advantage of the discord between Feng and Shi You'san to try to win over Shi's troops, so that they will firmly defend the key passes north of the Yellow River to prevent Feng from invading Hebei. (3) Zhang Yinwu, commander of the 4th Route Army of the Jin Army, commanded the three divisions of Feng Pengzhu, Wang Jingguo, and Li Fuying, and moved from Peiping to the Zhengding and Shunde area to concentrate, seemingly preparing for Feng's ambiguous attitude. (4) Sun Chu is now using Shi You'san against Yan, but there is no clear indication, fearing that Shi will take advantage of it. Therefore, Sun's troops have not dared to launch a joint attack with Shi's troops. (30th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e8">Establishment of the New German Cabinet <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The new premier of the German cabinet has been confirmed as Dr. Brüning of the Catholic Centre Party. The Catholic Centre Party advocates religious principles and leans to the right. Superficially, the new government will definitely revert to the right wing. However, reports say that Brüning has changed his position and will only select like-minded individuals to work with him, without relying on various parties. In that case, the future political situation may not change much. If the reports are inaccurate and he still wants to restore the situation of the Marx cabinet when the right-wing was in power, then disputes can be seen immediately. This can be proven by the past experiences of the German political situation.</p>
<p>Since its defeat in the war, Germany has been nominally a republic, but in reality, people's hearts are restless. Democracy has not taken root. The monarchist factions continue to be active. By 1924, the competition between the left and right parties became fierce. However, the election results showed that neither the extreme right nor the extreme left gained power. Only the Centre Party, which leans to the right, greatly increased its strength. In 1927, Marx came out to form a cabinet, composed of incompatible elements such as the Centre Party, the Nationalist Party, the People's Party, and the Bavarian People's Party. Marx himself leaned to the right, and the right-wing forces began to revive. At that time, due to the tyranny of the Nationalist Party, the Centre Party announced its religious principles, and also clashed with the People's Party, which advocated the separation of politics and religion. The coalition policy advocated by Marx was completely unable to be implemented. The Marx cabinet was on the verge of collapse. By the beginning of 1928, the German political situation was becoming increasingly chaotic, while the left-wing parties were gradually consolidating. Therefore, the results of the general election that year showed that the right-wing parties completely failed. As a result, the Social Democratic Party rose to power. Party leader Müller came out to form a cabinet and changed the policies of the previous cabinet. In his announcement of administrative guidelines, he advocated international coordination as the goal of foreign policy and opposed all dangerous ideas, which won the broadest sympathy at home and abroad. As a result, the left wing achieved a great victory. Although this was due to the internal division of the right wing, it was also inevitable due to the global trend. Now it has collapsed due to a temporary financial problem, but the strength of the left wing has not diminished slightly. Therefore, Brüning succeeded in forming a cabinet. If the Centre Party can realize the incompatibility of the previous six-party coalition and the moderates of the Nationalist Party can realize the incompatibility of the old elements and change their plans, and if Brüning can realize that actively leaning to the right is not in line with the trend and announce new policies that are open and aboveboard without resorting to arbitrary policies, then he can organize a strong and powerful government similar to the Austrian model. If so, Brüning's new cabinet may be able to coexist peacefully. Otherwise, political disputes will arise from this. Its impact on the future of Germany is not insignificant.</p>

<p>Zhang Qixiong's Brigade Recaptures Yuanzhou</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Zhi telegraphed Chairman Chiang, stating that after investigation, five or six out of ten counties in western Jiangxi have fallen. Prolonging the time will only deepen the poisoning. If we do not save them now, it will be incurable later. From a global perspective, Yan and Feng are colluding and secretly plotting rebellion, which is undoubtedly an imminent crisis. However, the communist bandits in Jiangxi Province are spreading day by day, which is even more of a threat to the Central Government's heartland. Weighing the urgency, it is proposed to consider both and increase the number of capable troops, unify command, and assign responsibility for vigorous suppression to ensure domestic and foreign security. (30th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Jiangxi telegram: Zhu and Mao previously attacked Ganzhou, but due to the movement of Jin's troops to the east and the advance of the 18th Division's Yu Regiment and the 50th Division's Peng Regiment to Taihe, they fled south again.

From Zhengzhou to Shijiazhuang, they saw that the most troops were stationed along the way in Xinxiang, Cizhou, Shunde, Shijiazhuang, and Yuanshi, in addition to Zhengzhou. The troops in the Xinxiang area are Shi You'san's troops. Shi's 13th Route Army Headquarters was originally moved from Zhengzhou to Xinxiang. On the 27th, it was moved from Xinxiang to Daokou. The 13th Route Transportation Headquarters is still in Xinxiang. Sun Chu's troops are still in the Shunde area. Sun's trains have not yet departed. (30th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the negotiations to recover the property rights of the Great Eastern Telegraph Line, the Ministry of Communications has investigated and found that there are three contracts that expire at the end of 1930, and one contract that expired in 1925 but has not been abolished. It has been decided that when the two sides meet on April 4, they will separately propose the abolition of these contracts. The contents of the contracts are: (1) The company's Shanghai-Hong Kong telegraph line lands at Yangzijiao and connects with the land line at Yangzijiao. (2) The company's telegraph line lands at Chuanshi Mountain in Fujian and establishes a telegraph office. (3) The company borrows the land line of Nantai in Chuanshi Mountain. (4) The company borrows lines in Pinggu. All of these are detrimental to sovereignty and restrict our country's international business and pricing regulations, which is very unfair.

<p>Reuters, London, 29th The delegates to the Naval Conference will not hold meetings before Sunday, but according to newspaper reports, the points related to Articles 11 and 16 of the League of Nations Covenant have been submitted by the delegates to experts for study. The main aim of this study is to determine whether a formula can be established that can provide France with some guarantees to satisfy its prerequisite for reducing naval tonnage, while not binding Britain to military obligations. In addition to the League of Nations Covenant, the experts are studying the Locarno Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The British government believes that the current London Conference, without the participation of several countries related to the Mediterranean, cannot resolve the Mediterranean Pact issue. It is widely speculated that when the plenary session opens next Friday, the U.S. representatives will take this opportunity to explain the U.S. attitude toward the commercial blockade agreement, as the newspapers seem to have some doubts about this. According to news from The Times and other sources, the current situation is roughly as follows: the U.S. representatives are unwilling to consider participating in the commercial blockade agreement until the European countries have reached an agreement on the Mediterranean issue and the Five-Power Naval Limitation Treaty has been signed.</p>

<p>The World Society reports that according to a recent survey by the Social Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs, the disputes in the Showa 4 fiscal year (April of Showa 4 to March of Showa 5) both in quantity, with 600 disputes, and in participating personnel, with 78,000, exceeded the previous ten-year high of 497 cases and 63,137 people. The reasons are as follows: (1) extreme economic depression in the business world, low labor conditions, and non-payment of wages; (2) the impact of industrial rationalization, the merger and reorganization of various businesses, and the use of machinery; (3) due to the government's austerity policy before and after the lifting of the gold embargo, business owners actively reorganized and scaled down their businesses; (4) since the abolition of night work for women and children from the first day of last month, it has led to a shortening of working hours, a decrease in production costs, an increase in labor, and a reduction in wages, resulting in layoffs; (5) before the ban on night work, labor unions used large-scale disputes in the textile industry as a restraining tactic; (6) since the crackdown on the Communist Party, the extreme suppression of leftist labor unions and the tripartite struggle of the General Federation of Labor Unions, the Council of Labor Unions, and the Labor Union Alliance have disintegrated, and the Labor Union Alliance and the General Federation of Labor Unions have become two hegemons confronting each other, leading to an expansion of the power of the union movement. Moreover, in terms of quality, emotional and reckless disputes have almost disappeared, and most disputes are passive. The demands are also mostly passive, such as opposing wage cuts, opposing layoffs, and opposing the deterioration of labor conditions, with fewer active demands such as shortening working hours, demanding welfare facilities, and increasing wages.</p>

No other personnel have been changed yet. Duan Maolan also went to the Telephone Bureau at 5 p.m. yesterday to meet with Director Chen Tang 　 and 　　　　　. (6) Most of the main personnel of each department had already left work and could not complete the handover, so they handed over the seal first and agreed to officially hand over the next day. At 8 a.m. today, Duan Chen went to the bureau to complete the handover procedures. Duan also appointed Zhou Chunbo as section chief of the affairs department and Zou Zhongyu as chief of general affairs and cashier. At 11 a.m., he convened all employees and held an inauguration ceremony.</p>
<p>Zhang Fengqi went to the Commodity Inspection Bureau at 4 p.m. to meet with Director Fei and took over immediately. According to Zhang, the Inspection Bureau was only established last year by the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce sending personnel to Tianjin, with a monthly income of about ten thousand yuan. There is also a commodity inspection office in Beijing, and he plans to go there to take over within days.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, because of military transport needs, Fu Zuoyi sent Lin Dexi to the Tianjin office of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to supervise everything. Lin then regarded himself as the future director. When the takeover order was issued, he led 20 members of the Garrison Headquarters' special task force in cars at 5 p.m. that afternoon, surrounded the office, and prohibited personnel from entering or leaving. However, it was already evening, and the staff had already left work, so it was impossible to take over. Lin immediately ordered the plainclothes task force to monitor Director Gao Hengru. Gao had no choice but to notify the personnel of each department to come to the office today, even though it was Sunday, to complete the handover. After Lin took over, he planned to make sweeping changes to the personnel. This was heard by the railway union, which elected representatives to petition, (1) The salaries of the staff of this office depend on the railway revenue. Please maintain the traffic conditions in the northern section and do not divert it for other purposes. (2) The staff of this office have been serving for one or two decades. Please do not replace them with novices. Although Lin expressed his acceptance of this, the Garrison Headquarters felt that his handling was inappropriate and telegraphed to guarantee that Liu Weizhou would be the director of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Administration. A management bureau may soon be organized in Tianjin.</p>
<p>When He Dizong went to the North China Water Conservancy Commission, because Chairman Xu Junti had been absent from his post for a long time and Acting Chairman Li Shutian was in Beijing, no one was responsible. He sealed off all offices. It is said that Li will return to Tianjin in the next few days to complete the handover.</p>
<p>The Cigarette Consolidated Tax Bureau is also an agency directly under the Ministry of Finance. Ten days ago, Yan Xishan telegraphed Gao Huai, director of the Zhangjiakou Public Security Bureau, to Tianjin to prepare for the takeover. It was not until 2 p.m. yesterday that Gao officially went to the bureau to take over. However, the handover of all accounts and books will take time, and it will probably take another day or two to complete the takeover. A large number of personnel in the bureau will be changed.</p>
<p>In addition, Sun Bi, director of the Jilu District Flour Special Tax Bureau, a central government agency, has been appointed by Yan, and the radio station has long been under the management of the municipal government and does not need to be changed. The Tianjin branch of the Hebei Stamp Tax Bureau will also be taken over by officials from the provincial government in the coming days. As for Ge Jingyou, superintendent of the Tianjin Customs, Lu Jinli, salt commissioner of Changlu, Yang Shiyi, director of the Parcel Consolidated Tax Bureau, and Bo Yizhong, supervisor of the mint, who are all close associates of Jin Yan, they will all be commissioned.</p>
<p>Because of the environment, the work of the Tianjin Municipal Party Headquarters had already been suspended. However, at 9 p.m. yesterday, more than 20 representatives from the joint associations of various district party headquarters suddenly arrived at the Municipal Party Headquarters with seals, paste, slogans, and other items, intending to seal it off. They were stopped by the police who were protecting it. Zhou Lechun, director of the fifth district's third branch, also arrived after hearing the news, and immediately telephoned the Public Security Bureau for instructions. The Public Security Bureau then asked the Garrison Headquarters for instructions. After consultation between the military and police authorities until 11 p.m., permission was granted to seal off the headquarters. The representatives then entered and sealed off the secretariat, the organization department, the propaganda department, the training department, the civil training committee, and the administrative accounting departments, posting various slogans and ordering the staff of each department to completely evacuate the dormitory within three days.

<h3 id="e69">Hebei Province's Measures to Protect Commerce and Mining <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Communication At the meeting of the Hebei Mining Reorganization Committee in Beijing, regarding the measures to protect commerce and mining, it was resolved at the second meeting that the Department of Agriculture and Mining would draft a plan and submit it to the meeting for discussion. The department then drafted four measures, divided into (1) Relief for Disaster-Stricken Mines, (2) Reduction of Transportation Costs, (3) Protection of Mining Rights, (4) Expansion of Transportation Routes, and submitted them to the fourth meeting, which resolved to pass them and forward them to the provincial government for approval. The measures are recorded below.</p>
<p>(1) Relief for Disaster-Stricken Mines The commerce and mining of Hebei Province have repeatedly been interrupted and exhausted due to the impact of war in recent years. Examining the precedents of various provinces providing relief for water and drought disasters by postponing or exempting land taxes, agricultural and mineral products are similar in nature. At the beginning of political tutelage, the government is still lenient, and it is appropriate to provide appropriate relief to disaster-stricken mines. It is proposed that all mines in the province, except those that are currently producing enough coal to maintain operations, and those that have been directly affected by military affairs and are currently suspended, should be reported by the Department of Agriculture and Mining to the provincial government, and depending on the circumstances, be granted a postponement or exemption of district tax for one to three years, and the original mining exploration period should be appropriately extended to show the intention of starting anew with the people.</p>
<p>(2) Reduction of Transportation Costs According to the regulations on coal transportation by railway, before 1923, the freight rate was 0.006425 silver dollars per ton per kilometer (Article 102 of the Transportation Regulations). Since 1925, the transportation regulations have been revised and the fees are charged according to Article 32 of the new regulations. Taking the section from Shijiazhuang to Yageying on the Ping-Han Railway as an example, the distance is 58 kilometers. If calculated according to the old regulations, the freight rate per ton is 39.6 cents in silver. The new regulations should charge 1.04 silver dollars. A survey in September 1929 showed that the Ping-Han freight rate for that year had increased by about two and a half times compared to before. On the Beining Railway, the rate per kilometer has also been revised to 1.37 cents since 1926, which is twice the old rate. According to reports from various mine owners, each 　 has used their own funds to improve, 　 the southern route's capital is heavy 　, and the annual amount has decreased in shape, and the railway revenue has also decreased accordingly. Such a mutual sickness of roads and mines is very meaningless. It is proposed that the provincial government consult with the competent ministry to appropriately reduce coal transportation fees to alleviate the difficulties of merchants.</p>
<p>(3) Protection of Mining Rights Mines that have obtained a license from the ministry have obtained legal property rights, and the local government has the responsibility to protect them. Their business operations and the exercise of mining rights should be given full convenience. If they do not violate current laws and regulations, no agency may forcibly dispose of them or revoke their mining rights. As for private small-scale mining, which has recently damaged the interests of general mine owners, it should be strictly prohibited. It is proposed that the government issue a clear announcement to show solemnity.</p>
<p>(4) Expansion of Transportation Routes The railways within Hebei Province, Pingpu and Beining are biased to the east, and Pingsui is biased to the west. Although the Ping-Han line runs north-south, the central and southern parts still lack east-west connecting lines. Therefore, the coal production and sales of the Jingxing, Lincheng, and Cixian three major mining areas are not widespread, and their business is not thriving. The frequent military transport in recent years has made it impossible for the Ping-Han line to operate smoothly.</p>
<p>The sales of Zhengfeng, Yili, Zhonghe, and other commercial mines are declining day by day, and they are suffering from losses. Now is the period of political tutelage, and construction is the top priority. The two roads, Cangshi and Shunjizi, which were advocated in the past, should be repaired immediately so that the large coalfields of Jingxing and Cixian can be mined as much as possible, and the output of various commercial mines will also increase, and the province's tax revenue will also increase accordingly. It is proposed that the provincial government urge the competent ministry to start construction on the above two roads as soon as possible. If the central government cannot take care of it for the time being, the province should raise funds to start construction first.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Beiping Seizes a Case of Japanese Merchants Smuggling a Large Quantity of Poisons <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Communication Yesterday (23rd) night at around 12 o'clock, a fast train on the Beining Railway arrived from Tianjin. Before reaching the Beiping Qianmen East Station, more than 20 boxes of medicines were brought by the Dongdan San Tiao Gu Shui Foreign Firm. At that time, the clerks of the foreign firm wanted to move them out of the station immediately so that they could be sent to the firm for storage. Just as the inspector of the East Station of the Public Security Bureau, Wei Jialu, arrived with policemen, he said that the items in the wooden boxes must be inspected to prove what kind of medicines were loaded in them. The managers of the foreign firm refused to open them. Later, the inspector, together with the military and police stationed at the station, forcibly executed the order and opened each of the wooden boxes for inspection. It was found that the wooden boxes contained all milk sugar and other items used to prepare heroin, totaling more than 20 boxes, weighing about 7,400 pounds. Inspector Wei Jialu believed that the Japanese merchants were smuggling this poisonous substance under the guise of transporting medicines, which was a violation of the ban. He immediately took the more than 20 boxes of milk sugar and other items, along with the managers of the foreign firm, to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. The Japanese police station in Dongjiaominxiang heard about this and sent personnel to the Public Security Bureau at 4 p.m. today to meet with Pu Zhizhong, the chief of the third section of the bureau, to negotiate everything. The outcome is still unknown. It is said that the Public Security Bureau received a telegram from the Tianjin Anti-Drug Association and the Public Security Bureau of that city a few days ago, saying that a Japanese merchant had transported a large quantity of heroin from Dalian on a Japanese ship, worth about 100,000 yuan. After arriving in Tianjin, it would be transported to Beiping. They requested that the authorities be instructed to pay attention to the investigation together. After receiving the telegram, the Public Security Bureau immediately instructed its subordinates to step up the investigation. It is still unknown whether the Gu Shui Foreign Firm's milk sugar case at the East Station last night was the poisonous substance mentioned by the Tianjin Public Security Bureau. However, it can be seen from this that the Japanese are smuggling huge quantities of poisons to harm our people. (March 24)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Shandong Department of Construction's Views on Resolving the Fengyu Waterway Issue <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Communication Shandong Yutai County, which borders Jiangsu County, has frequent waterway disputes. The reason is that Yutai is low-lying, while Feng County is higher. The water from Feng County must pass through Yutai into Nanyang Lake, which often floods. Therefore, the people of Yu advocate building dikes to block the water, while the people of Feng advocate digging rivers to smooth the water, which often leads to disputes. At the National Construction Committee meeting held in Beijing this time, Chen Luanshu, director of the Shandong Department of Construction, proposed that the two provinces of Jiangsu and Shandong jointly send personnel to investigate and resolve the dispute. This has been passed by the conference, and the Construction Committee will send personnel to investigate and handle it jointly with the construction departments of the two provinces. This move is of great importance to the water conservancy of the two provinces. The original proposal of Chen Luanshu is recorded below: "Investigating the terrain of Feng County, it was originally low in the east and high in the west. The slope water from Shan, Yu, Dang and other counties all flowed into Zhaoyang and Weishan Lakes through the Shundi River. There was an old Taihang Dike, which ran east-west, to prevent the southward water from invading northward and forcing the water into the lake. The river was under the dike, hence the name Shundi River. At that time, there were no floods in Feng and Yu counties, and no waterway disputes occurred. The Bian Ditch was built by Prince Senggelinqin of the Qing Dynasty to prevent bandits. A dike was built on the flat ground, and the soil was taken to form a river, which became the boundary between the two counties, extending to the riverbank. Yutai is low-lying, almost like a basin. Even without water coming from the south, floods have been rampant. The people can only grow wheat once a year, and the autumn harvest is often poor. The area is very poor. Since the Yellow River (at that time, the Yellow River still entered the sea in Jiangsu) was decided twice, the Yellow River flooded north, encroaching on the canal (at that time, the canal was still west of the current canal, and the riverbed was low and easily flooded by the Yellow River. The one in the north of the Lu territory is the Zhao Wang River, and the one in the Su territory is the Jingshan Bridge River). The canal was silted up, and the Nanyang Lakes were also silted up. To avoid the dangers of the Yellow River Lüliang, it was proposed to move the canal east (that is, the current canal), raise the riverbed, and build a dam at the Linjiashan, the lower mouth of the Weihu Lake, to block the water and transport it. The bottom of the lake was silted up, and the water surface was raised. At that time, no less than thousands of acres of good land were submerged. At the same time, the Shundi River in Feng County was also silted up. The people of Feng proposed to dig the Taihang Dike and open north-south branch rivers, entering the Zhaoyang and Nanyang lakes through Yu territory. At that time, the people of Yu opposed it, but they did not get their wish. As a result, the floods in Yu territory were even more severe. The people of Yu along the border built side dikes to 　 prevent the water from the south, while the people of Feng dug rivers to smooth the water to the north. The disputes were the fiercest, and armed clashes occurred repeatedly. In the third year of Tongzhi, the two governors of Jiangsu and Shandong sent personnel to investigate and determine that Feng would not dig rivers and Yu would not build dikes, allowing them to be leveled, and this became a final decision. Later, the side dikes gradually became flat, and the Bian Ditch and the east and west branch rivers were all silted up. Both Feng and Yu counties suffered from floods. In 1928, Feng County privately dug the Taihang Dike and dug a new river on the west branch river, leading the water from Dang, Yu, Shan, and Feng counties into the Yu territory. The people of Yu did not agree in advance, and the work was completed quickly. Once the precedent was broken, the disputes arose again. The construction departments of Jiangsu and Shandong provinces had sent personnel to investigate and originally planned to connect and dig the east and west branch rivers, entering the Zhaoyang and Nanyang lakes, and dredge the Zhao Wang River and Jingshan Bridge River, which would be dredged separately by Jiangsu and Shandong provinces. Later, because this was related to the drainage and transportation of Huai in Jiangsu Province, it was delayed for more than a year and was not resolved in the end. If Lu Province connects and digs the west branch river, the Nanyang Lakes have been silted up for a long time and have limited water capacity. If the water from several counties is concentrated in Yutai, which is low-lying, it will inevitably become a swamp. There is no way to solve the problem without seeking a way to discharge water downstream. If Feng County does not dig the Taihang Dike, the water will converge in the middle and the way to enter the lake eastward through the Shundi River is blocked, and the terrain is also higher. If the Taihang Dike is blocked and the Shundi River is dug, so that the water can be taken eastward into the lake, although the river line is only 20 miles long, the people of Feng are absolutely unwilling to dig rivers on the plains again, and they are especially unwilling for the people of Yu to build side dikes to prevent water from coming north. Therefore, it has been delayed for a long time and has not been resolved. However, the new river in Feng County has been completed, and the people of Yu are extremely angry. Armed clashes occur frequently along the border. If measures are not taken quickly, a tragic conflict caused by floods will definitely be inevitable. If we want to dredge the Zhaowei Lakes, Jiangsu is using excuses to oppose it. This kind of thing is of great importance to the water conservancy of the two provinces. How should it be handled? Please make a public decision. Proposer Chen Luanshu."</p>
<h3 id="e72">Quanzhou Strictly Enforces the Eradication of Opium Poppy Seedlings <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Villagers in various villages outside the South Gate of Quanzhou have been privately planting opium poppies this year. Recently, the plants have grown to several feet tall, flowered, and borne fruit, and are about to be harvested. The Jinjiang County Party Department recently sent a letter to the county government and Commander Liu, requesting them to send troops to eradicate them. The original letter stated, "According to reports from villagers, opium poppy seedlings are everywhere in Shangzhai Village, Maping Village, Shangshan Village, Xiadian Village, Xiabaocuo, Zengcuo, Sucuo, Sizhizhu, Qiankeng, Xidian Taibai Mountain, and other places in the southern countryside outside the South Gate of Quanzhou, as well as Shang'an, Qinbingshe, Tanhu, Xikeng, Shidou, and Yingdai villages near Anhai, and are about to mature. The scourge of opium, in its mildest form, leads to loss of life and bankruptcy, and in its worst form, national extinction. It has long been strictly prohibited. The ignorant people have no respect for the law, which is deeply regrettable. We hereby request that you investigate and, within the shortest possible time, strictly order the villagers in these villages to eradicate the seedlings themselves. If they do not comply, please coordinate with the garrison troops to seriously deal with the matter to maintain the prohibition." After receiving the letter, County Magistrate Chen Tingheng immediately issued a notice ordering the villagers to eradicate the seedlings themselves within three days. On the 13th, he led a regiment of Commander Liu's troops to the villages to supervise the eradication personally. Later, because the regiment was transferred back, Brigadier Chen has reassigned a battalion to supervise the eradication. (March 20th)</p>

<p>Bengbu Dispatch: The Traffic Corps of the Land, Naval, and Air Force Headquarters, under the command of Qiu Wei, has recently been ordered to build a light railway from Suxian to Xiangcheng to facilitate transportation. Recently, a certain deputy commander of the corps arrived in Su from the capital by train with the entire unit. After disembarking, they set up camp at Yiji Wood Factory in Dongguan. They then sent surveyors to survey westward from the Suxian Railway Station. The route crosses the Hui River, the North Fei River, the Wo River, the Qingshui River, and the Shangshui River, requiring the construction of five bridge. The river bodies are not very wide, so there is no need for large-scale construction. The route passes through Mengcheng, Guoyang, Taihe, Shenqiu, and other places in Suxian, all the way to Xiangcheng, totaling more than 600 li. It is said that the project is scheduled to be completed in three months. In addition to using military engineers for construction, the corps also plans to hire civilians, paying them 15 yuan per month, with food provided by themselves. (March 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Fierce Battle Between Police and Bandits in Yangcheng Lake <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>One Bandit Ship Captured, Fourteen Hostages Rescued</p>
<p>Suzhou Dispatch: Due to the rampant banditry in Yangcheng Lake, the First Squad of the Second Company of the Wuxian Police Team was stationed at Taiping Bridge in Xiangcheng to prevent them. On the morning of the 28th of this month, several bandit ships suddenly appeared in Wangxiang, about a li away from Taiping Bridge. After learning of this, Squad Leader Shen Gang ordered the officers to deploy at various checkpoints to surround and attack the bandits after they landed, hoping to wipe them out in one fell swoop. However, the bandits learned of the plan and immediately fled. The next day (29th), Squad Leader Shen ordered Patrol Sergeant Lu Hanzhou to lead five policemen to search the area along Yangcheng Lake. At that time, several vessels resembling bandit ships were approaching. Sergeant Lu ordered them to approach the shore, but the bandits, seeing the weak police force, opened fire to resist arrest. A firefight ensued. After learning that Sergeant Lu had engaged the bandits, Squad Leader Shen ordered Special Agent Li Peijie to lead police reinforcements. At the same time, Squad Leader Shen also divided the police into two groups to attack the bandits from the rear. The bandits, seeing the increased police force, made a final desperate struggle. Squad Leader Shen then used a submachine gun to fire, killing five bandits. The bandits, unable to withstand the attack, collapsed and fled. The police team captured one bandit ship, inside which were hidden fourteen male and female hostages. Squad Leader Shen ordered the police team to continue to suppress the fleeing bandits, and today (30th) escorted the hostages to the headquarters of the Second Company of the County Police Team and reported to the brigade headquarters. The rescued hostages include Zhang Yunhong and Zhang Yilai (kidnapped on a Jiaxing shuttle boat on March 11), Dang Zhuanmen Hu (kidnapped on a mountain goods boat in Yangcheng Lake on the 28th of this month), Fei Cao (who came to Suzhou for medical treatment due to illness and was kidnapped on a Li shuttle boat), Mei Xingsheng (kidnapped on December 24th of last year when a large gang of lake bandits robbed him), Ding Wu, Pan Shangdi, Zhu A'da, Jiang A'da, Ge Sanbao, Zhang Zhushi, and others, totaling fourteen people. Of the above hostages, the eight female hostages were bailed out by relatives and temporarily stayed at the Yuandong Hotel for questioning, while the eight male hostages stayed at the team headquarters. According to Mei Xingsheng, a hostage from Luxu, the bandits either tied red and green cloths to their guns or wore them on their clothes. The guns were all Mauser pistols. The bandits often hid in the Yangcheng Lake area and had an office in the Yang'ertai Temple. The bandit leader was Hong Taiye, and the junior leader was Zhang Laochan. Two hostages from Zhangpu Town were shot and killed by the Hong bandits for attempting to escape, their heads were cut off and hung up, and their abdomens were cut open to remove their hearts and livers, which were cooked and eaten. There were two accountants who were kidnapped hostages. Because they could write, the bandits ordered them to specialize in contacting the hostages' families. The bandits drilled on shore every two or three days. They were originally from the Haizhou gang, with nine bandit ships. After robbing Zhangpu Town, they joined forces with gangs from Pudong and Anhui, totaling more than thirty bandit ships, all of which were fishing boats. The bandits numbered more than two hundred and had considerable strength.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Impact of the Lifting of the Gold Embargo in Japan <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch: Since Japan implemented the lifting of the gold embargo on January 1st of this year, it has had a tremendous impact on society and the economy. With the freedom to export gold, the gold standard system can finally function. The impact of the so-called lifting of the gold embargo stems from this function. For example, if imports exceed exports, the exchange rate will fall. To prevent it from exceeding the cash settlement point, a large outflow of specie is necessary. The specie reserve decreases, causing currency contraction and a drop in prices. A drop in prices will restrain imports and promote exports. After a period of time, the exchange rate will increase, allowing it to return to a balanced state. This is the normal way of finance. However, the speed of change is not always consistent, and imbalances inevitably cause economic shocks. Moreover, restoring the balanced state is easier for countries with abundant production. It is particularly difficult for Japan, which lacks resources. Therefore, after the lifting of the embargo, Japan, despite making considerable preparations such as economizing the budget and setting up credit, inevitably suffered a major blow.</p>
<p>According to general observations, the impact of the gold embargo lifting is nothing more than reduced imports, outflow of specie, currency contraction, drop in prices, and market decline. The impact of Japan's gold embargo lifting is summarized as follows: (1) Foreign trade: Since January of this year, Japan's exports amounted to 312,070,000 yuan, while imports amounted to 394,672,000 yuan. Although there was an import surplus of 82,745,000 yuan, it decreased by 81,110,000 yuan compared with the import surplus of 163,854,000 yuan in the same period last year. Furthermore, the import surplus in early March was only 4,070,000 yuan. If this is used as a basis for calculation, Japan's trade import surplus for this year will only be half of last year's. Therefore, the impact of the gold embargo lifting on trade is not very bad. (2) Specie and currency: After the lifting of the embargo, foreign banks withdrew their funds from Japan one after another, and domestic exchange banks continuously cashed in specie due to the lack of specie abroad. As of February 15, the Bank of Japan's specie reserve had decreased to 1 billion yuan. The Bank of Japan's balance sheet on the 20th showed only 988,570,000 yuan of existing specie, the lowest in the past decade. The amount of banknotes issued was 1,105,988,000 yuan, the lowest since 1916. Taken together, since the start of cash settlement on January 11, the amount of specie cashed in has reached 164 million yuan, mainly cashed out by Mitsui Trust, Mitsui Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo Banks. In addition to the domestic cash settlement amount, there was also approximately 70 million yuan of specie allocated abroad. Therefore, since the lifting of the gold embargo, a total of more than 230 million yuan of specie has been lost in just two months, far beyond expectations. The Bank of Japan's banknote issuance has lost its flexibility, and its ability to control finance is questionable. This is truly an irreparable flaw after the lifting of the gold embargo. (3) Market conditions: After the lifting of the gold embargo, the general economic situation of society has shown a decline, what the Japanese call "recession." During this spring's general election, "prosperity or recession" became the theme of political warfare. The reality of this "recession" can be proven by the increase or decrease in general private savings. According to statistics from financial institutions, private savings have decreased twofold, or 50 million yuan, after the lifting of the gold embargo, and all savings institutions are trying to compete for savings. Those who previously refused savings from fellow institutions are now welcoming them. Those who previously prohibited employees from soliciting savings are now secretly reviving. According to the Tokyo Stock Exchange's report, the prices of various other stocks have also fallen sharply. The "recession" in the market is very obvious. (4) Prices: In the two months since the lifting of the gold embargo, commodity prices on the market have not differed greatly from those before the lifting of the embargo due to merchants' control. However, the prices of agricultural products have fallen sharply. The most obvious is the sharp drop in silk prices. Raw silk is a major export product of Japan, and 3 million households are engaged in the production of its raw material, "cocoons." These are all small farmers and workers. Therefore, silk occupies an important position in Japan's international trade and national economy. Currently, each bundle (100 catties) has fallen to 1,100 yuan, a disastrous drop not seen in the past decade. The authorities believe that this is shaking the entire world and are implementing a price compensation loss compensation method, deciding to adjust the price to 190 yuan, with a financing amount of 1,200 yuan. This amount of 1,200 yuan is more than 100 yuan higher than the market price, but it is still 10% lower than the production cost. Furthermore, the regulations for this compensation method originally stipulated that the compensation amount for the five years from September 1, 1929, was limited to 30 million yuan. If this session compensates for a loss of 20 million yuan, then only 10 million yuan will remain for the long term of the next four years, which is not a safe method.</p>
<p>In short, after the lifting of the gold embargo in Japan, specie has flowed out, currency has contracted, people's purchasing power has decreased, the market has shown a decline, prices have fallen, and producers have suffered greatly. All the hardships predicted before the lifting of the gold embargo have unfortunately come true. Judging from the above, the impact of Japan's gold embargo lifting is truly bad. These adverse consequences cannot be entirely attributed to the gold embargo lifting. There are many other reasons, such as the stagnation of the US financial world, the increase in Indian tariffs, and the sharp drop in the price of silver in China. "Recession" has become a common international phenomenon. However, Japan's industrial capital is abnormally developed. After the lifting of the gold embargo, a small number of large capitalists may gain temporary benefits, but the majority of poor people suffer great harm. In addition, Japan's resources are very scarce, and the sales channels for goods are increasingly restricted. Overall, income cannot cover expenditures. If this continues, the future is worrying. Furthermore, the number of unemployed people in the country has reached more than 300,000, the majority of whom are poor workers. The unemployment of the intellectual class is particularly alarming. It is estimated that 82,300 people sought jobs last year, but only 8,400 were employed, with the unemployed accounting for 90%. This is truly the root of society's problems. The so-called "economic national crisis" and "ideological national crisis" are all based on this. After the lifting of the gold embargo, it has become even more profound. The way to remedy this crisis lies entirely in the sincerity and effort of the authorities.</p>

<p>Uncertain Bandit Alarm: Yesterday, reports spread that large bandit ships were discovered in Ye Xie and other places bordering Songjiang and Fengxian. Ding Zhiyan of the County Police Team was ordered to rush there overnight to prepare for a fierce attack and returned to the team today (28th). According to him, the whole thing was a rumor, and no bandit ships had passed through the area. There were no traces of lingering in Zhangjiatang, Wujiaqiao, or the surrounding area. When asked about the source of the intelligence at the time, it was said that it was a verbal report to the Eighth Public Security Bureau by a villager.

<p>Zhang Zhujiang Kidnapped, Still Missing: The town of Tianma Mountain in the county had just stopped large-scale gambling. The next night (10th), local security officer Zhang Yuxing and his nephew Zhang Zhujiang were kidnapped by bandits. Family members searched everywhere but found no trace of them. Recently, it was reported that the family received a letter from the bandits demanding a ransom of 3,000 yuan for Zhujiang and 200 yuan for Yuxing. They were scheduled to negotiate next month, but the letter did not mention the location of the negotiation, so the family is still not optimistic.</p>
<p>Victim Seriously Injured in Tianma Mountain Robbery: Wang Ziyun (previously mistakenly written as Qin), son of the head of the Wu family village in Tianma Mountain, was suddenly robbed of rice by bandits on the evening of the 27th. The case has been reported to the local police station and forwarded to the county government for investigation. According to reports, the bandits were all armed with sharp knives. After entering the house, they monitored the victim's actions and searched for cash and clothing. The bandits were not satisfied and forced Ziyun to reveal the location of his hidden silver. When he refused, he was slashed three times, seriously injuring him. He immediately bled profusely and fainted to the ground. The bandits then robbed all 30 shi of white rice and loaded it onto the Wang family's boat to transport it away. Ziyun's serious injuries have been treated, but his life may be in danger. It is also reported that 28 shi of the stolen white rice have been sold to a rice shop in the city.</p>
<p>Antiquities Missing from Shiyingtang: Shiyingtang, formerly located in front of the old Deputy Office, was once renovated during the era of warlords and the popularity of Taoist temples. It enshrined statues of Guan Yu and Yue Fei, as well as many statues of ancient and modern generals, making it a place for worshiping Guan Yu and Yue Fei. In recent years, the military's stationing has been unstable and no one is managing the temple, and it has gradually fallen into disrepair. Beggars have been secretly peeling off the gold plating on the statues. The temple has lost its former solemnity. However, it is reported that the ancient bronze bell from the Han Dynasty, the intricately carved offering table, and the exquisite rockery have all disappeared. The authorities are secretly investigating the names of those who stole and sold the items to pursue the matter.</p>

<p>Branch Secretary Forcibly Occupies Meat Industry's Public Property: The Qingpu County Party Affairs Reorganization Committee held its sixth regular meeting yesterday. The Training Department reported that ten members of the Meat Industry Merchants' First Branch, including Shen Jingtao, accused the branch secretary Yu Yangbo of manipulating branch affairs and forcibly occupying the meat industry's public property, requesting his dismissal. After investigation by the headquarters, the charges were found to be true.

Furthermore, Zhang Ye, a citizen of the First District, submitted a petition stating that her husband did not provide support and requested assistance. It was resolved that a letter should be sent to the Provincial Women's Association Reorganization Committee for nearby handling.</p>
<p>A Playful Remark Nearly Caused a Major Disaster: An official of the First Public Security Bureau of Xujing Town, Seventh District of Qingpu County, usually acts improperly. One day, while passing through a road construction site, a group of workers asked him for cigarettes. He jokingly said, "I have a cigar, do you want it?" At that time, there were many women working there, and they carefully distinguished his words and seemed to detect insulting behavior. They were all indignant. Seeing that things were not going well, he immediately ran away. Before long, seven or eight hundred road construction workers gathered, making a commotion and swarming to the public security bureau, wanting to make things difficult for him. Knowing that he was in the wrong, he avoided meeting them. That day, the police inspector was away on business, and there was no one to mediate. However, the workers gathered and refused to leave, saying that if they did not get satisfaction today, they would destroy the police bureau. Afterwards, Kim, the assistant administrator of the district office, fearing a major disaster, temporarily hung up a sign dismissing the official on his behalf. The workers then dispersed.</p>

<p>Letter from Xia Muren of Jinling University</p>
<p>Dear Sir, Recent reports in the newspapers of Nanjing and Shanghai regarding the showing of a film by yours truly at a general meeting of the youth members of Jinling University on the evening of the 22nd of this month, which has caused external criticism, have caused me deep unease. Upon investigation, one reel of the film shown by yours truly that evening was self-made and contained depictions of the actual living conditions of Chinese farmers and the poor. The motivation for its production was to serve as material and reference for social science students studying Chinese social problems. There was absolutely no intention to promote it externally, nor was there any intention to insult the Chinese people. Moreover, when the Jinling University YMCA initially contacted me to show the film, the original intention was to show a film that had just been ordered from Shanghai. Unexpectedly, that film failed to arrive on time, and yours truly's self-made film was used as a temporary substitute, which led to the misunderstanding at the time. This was truly not the original intention. Yours truly has not been here for long, and there are inevitably some gaps in my understanding of Chinese customs and habits. I deeply regret this incident and would like to express my apologies to the Chinese people. I respectfully hope for your understanding and earnestly request that this letter be published in your newspaper's letter section. I would be eternally grateful. Sincerely, Xia Muren, Professor of Sociology at Private Jinling University, March 29th.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Summary of the Draft Law and Explanatory Memorandum <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>China's currency system reform is urgently needed, and both the replacement of the current chaotic currency with a nationally unified currency system and the adoption of the gold standard are critical. A chaotic currency system in a country greatly hinders trade and national development and prosperity. China is now the only major country in the world with silver as its standard. This standard greatly harms China, especially its foreign trade and government finances. Foreign trade is prone to disputes because of the silver standard, and almost all of the government's revenue is in silver, but a large portion of its payments are calculated in gold, making it difficult to settle its finances.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Recommendations for the Gold Standard <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>This draft law provides for the gradual adoption of a suitable gold exchange standard and seeks to permanently withdraw the various existing currencies, so that China will have a nationally unified gold currency system. The unit of the new currency system is proposed to be named "Sun," containing 0.0601866 grams of pure gold, with a value equal to 40 US cents (2.50 Sun equals US$1.00), 1 shilling and 7.7265 pence, and 0.8025 Japanese yen. The choice of this unit is largely due to the fact that, in practice, it is calculated in gold and is equal in value to the silver coins currently circulating in many parts of China. If the current silver unit is changed to a gold unit of approximately equal value, then prices, wages, and lending relationships will not be disrupted, or if there are any disturbances, they will be minimal. For example, if a person's monthly income is 100 yuan under the current standard, then that person's income will still be approximately 100 Sun when calculated under the changed gold standard. Also, an item that costs one yuan today will cost about one Sun in the future.</p>
<p>This draft law provides for the minting of silver coins of one Sun, five jiao, and two jiao, and copper coins of one jiao, five fen, one fen, half a fen, and two li. However, the smallest copper coins will not be minted unless there is an urgent need. This draft law does not provide for the minting of gold coins, because there is no need to mint or circulate gold coins under the gold standard, and most gold standard countries today do not use gold coins as active currency. However, this draft law provides for maintaining the par value of various currencies with a fixed gold currency unit and, as described below, provides for a mechanism that allows the increase or decrease in the amount of currency in circulation to be the same as the increase or decrease in the amount of currency in circulation in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom as a result of the actual export and import of gold. As a result, this system can have the main characteristics of the gold standard without minting or circulating gold coins.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Credit Currency Convertible into Drafts <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>All currencies, including the Sun, are credit currencies and are maintained at par with gold by giving the government the option of unlimited conversion into drafts on various gold standard countries or into gold bars. Although this draft law gives the government the option of conversion into gold bars, this type of conversion is unlikely to be used frequently.</p>
<p>The conversion of credit currency is usually done with drafts payable in New York or London. The amount of the draft should be 2,000 Sun or more, and each draft must be subject to an exchange fee based on the cost of transporting gold from the Chinese city where the draft is issued to the foreign city where the draft is paid. If gold coins are circulating in China and the exchange rate reaches the gold export point, then exporters of cash must also bear the same fees as this exchange fee. Currency converted in this way effectively ceases to circulate, as if it has left the country, which is the same as in gold standard countries where gold coins are circulating.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a method equivalent to the import of cash into China is provided, whereby a certain bank acting as China's agent in a foreign country sells drafts payable in China in gold standard currency. The exchange fee charged is equal to the cost of transporting cash to China. Thus, the increase in Chinese currency has the same effect as the import of cash into China, and the rise and fall of the exchange rate is similar to that of a gold standard country with gold currency circulating, stopping at the gold export and import points. China is always prepared to exchange its domestic currency for foreign gold drafts and to pay this currency to exchange for foreign gold coins sold abroad, and its exchange rate is the same as that set by the gold export and import points. The so-called gold export and import points here refer to the point in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom where the exchange rate reaches the point where it is profitable to export or import cash.</p>
<p>According to the aforementioned method, a gold standard trust fund must be established to convert Chinese currency and sell drafts payable in Chinese currency abroad. This fund must be at least 35% of the value of the circulating currency and be divided into two parts. The first part of the fund includes cash and foreign drafts payable in cash. The second part includes gold standard currency circulating within China and metals purchased for minting purposes. The first part of the fund is deposited in two or three foreign financial centers, and at the beginning, it is probably only deposited in New York and London. The interest on this deposit belongs to the Chinese government, but this part of the fund is exclusively for the aforementioned purpose of converting Chinese currency by means of drafts.</p>
<p>The second part of the fund, which includes Chinese currency and metals for minting purposes, is used as a source of new currency when needed and to withdraw currency when there is an excess of currency by converting it into drafts. Therefore, the second part of the fund becomes a buffer fund that can automatically adjust the supply of Chinese currency to meet the needs of trade changes. When the first part of the fund is depleted too much, it can be automatically stopped by the contraction of Chinese currency. The converted Chinese currency is transferred to the second part of the fund and is not issued.</p>
<p>The fund and the gold standard are managed by the Currency System Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. The fund may be audited at any time by the Shanghai Banking Association, the Shanghai Chinese Chamber of Commerce, or the Central Bank.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Seigniorage Profits <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The currencies provided for in this draft law are all credit currencies, so the amount of metal they contain is lower than their face value, and the government can obtain huge seigniorage profits from minting currencies. In gold standard countries, the actual value and face value of all currencies other than gold currency must be very different; otherwise, if the gold price of silver, copper, etc., rises, their actual value will be higher than their face value, and there will be a tendency to melt them down to sell silver and copper. Therefore, the consolidation of currencies will be shaken, and other disadvantages will occur. Now</p>

<p>Based on the current price of silver (as of the month in 1929), the difference between the actual value and the face value of a silver Sun coin is about one-thirteenth. The difference for small currencies is even greater, especially for silver and copper coins.</p>
<p>Assuming that the amount of silver coins circulating per person in China is equal to US$1.80, and that the amount of silver and copper coins circulating is equal to US$0.26, then the seigniorage profit from minting these currencies is about US$330,000,000. If the amount circulating per person is greater or smaller than this, then the seigniorage profit obtained by the government will also be greater or smaller accordingly. According to recent estimates, the amount of silver rupees circulating per person in India is about US$3.51, and subsidiary currencies or paper currencies are not included. However, paper currency is more important in India than in China, so it seems prudent for us to assume that US$1.80 is the amount circulating per person in China. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e104">Facilities for Entertaining Athletes <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The preparatory office of the National Games has been meticulous in its entertainment and arrangements for the athletes participating in this congress, setting up a cash storage room for athletes, a merchandise sales department, and now preparing to set up a reading room, information desk, suggestion box, reception room, and rest room. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reading Room: The reading room has been established. More than ten major newspapers from Shanghai and Hangzhou, two Western newspapers, and more than forty kinds of Shanghai tabloids, as well as sports weekly magazines, are purchased daily. The propaganda team dispatches staff to replace them daily, so that athletes from all over can read various news from various places after exercise, slightly ease their homesickness, and feel comfortable physically and mentally.</p>
<p>Information Desk: The setting up of the information desk is originally for the convenience of athletes. If there is anything unclear about various affairs and competition matters, they can directly go to the information desk to inquire about everything so as to understand and avoid estrangement. It has already been organized and established by the General Affairs and Competition Sections, who have dispatched staff.</p>
<p>Suggestion Box: More than two thousand athletes participated in this congress. The association fears that athletes may have opinions or reports of dissatisfaction with the congress, which can be submitted to the box. Three boxes have now been placed in the athlete dormitories, each with one, so that the congress can adopt or reform.</p>
<p>Reception Room: The association believes that athletes from all over the world will have friends and former colleagues coming to visit Hangzhou. However, since there are many people in the dormitory, entry and exit are extremely inconvenient. A reception room has been specially opened for athletes to meet guests.</p>
<p>Rest Room: Outside the reception room, it is prepared for athletes to rest. The arrangement has already begun. The reading room is attached to the room, and a post and telegraph office is also added for athletes to receive and send telegrams and express letters.</p>
<p>Other: As for laundry matters, the Xu Lixin Laundry Company has been contracted to handle it. The reception team has prepared bamboo sticks (about 4,000 sticks, two per number). Athletes should tie the clothes to be washed together and attach a bamboo stick with their bed number, and open a separate list so that the laundry factory can check the list and avoid errors. Other things include setting up a notice board and a report board outside the athlete dormitories. If there are any matters, they can be written on it. A report board is also set up in the dining hall to report the names of the dishes. Skylights have been added to the toilets, as well as cleanliness slogans and regulations.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Japanese Predictions for the Far Eastern Games Athletics <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Certain Victory... Disregarding Everything</p>
<p>Mr. Oda Mikio's Talk... Please Listen, Countrymen</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch, 23rd: Oda Mikio, the leading athlete in the track and field competition at Waseda University in Japan, is a first-class athlete in Japanese track and field. The most successful athlete in the Far Eastern Games was Mr. Gaderon of the Philippines, who won a total of nine times. Mr. Oda was second with a total of six wins. He won the long jump twice with a score of 7.070 meters, the triple jump twice with a score of 15.355 meters, and the decathlon once with a score of 5504 points. These are all Far Eastern Games records.</p>
<p>Mr. Oda has a very detailed talk about the athletics competition at this congress. His statements about Japan's strength are quite reliable and offer much for us to consider. What follows is Mr. Oda's talk:</p>
<p>Since the Far Eastern Games began, Japan has been progressing year by year. Since winning the athletics championship at the eighth games in Shanghai, (referring to Japan) strong players have doubled. We are absolutely optimistic about this congress, and the championship is not in question. However, it is not yet possible to monopolize all events. In terms of strength, all previous sessions have been remarkable, but there are several events in which we have never won, such as short distance, high jump low hurdles, and the high jump. This time, we will definitely open a new chapter. The talents in general are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e110">100 Meters <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Although there has been exceptional progress in short-distance running since the previous year, we will inevitably face a tough battle this time. The most promising for the 100 meters should be Mr. Nambu Chuhei. Last year, in the Japan-Germany competition, he was able to win against the powerful German athletes, which is undeniable proof that he is the number one short-distance runner in Japan today. Although Ozawa, Abu, Nishi, Yoshioka, Aizawa, and Yano are also skilled in this area, it is difficult to guarantee a record of ten seconds. If we compete against the Philippine army, it is feared that it will be difficult to have a certain victory. Therefore, the championship for this event may still be given to others this time.</p>
<h3 id="e111">200 Meters <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Speaking of the 200 meters, there are truly many talents, such as Ozawa, Nakajima, Abu, Yoshioka, Nishi, Yano, and Aizawa. They all have records of 22 seconds or faster. With these talents, the victory is assured. Among them, the most confident are Ozawa, Yoshioka, and Nakajima. Mr. Ozawa reached a record of 21.6 seconds twice last year. Yoshioka and Nakajima both have wonderful running styles. Yoshioka is slightly better than Nakajima with his skills honed from a hundred battles. Both are young and will have more opportunities to serve Japan in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e112">400 Meters <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Nado won the championship for this event at the Osaka Games. After he left, there was a lack of talent in the 400 meters. It was not until last year that Mr. Nakajima achieved a record close to Nado's. It can be said that the progress of the 400 meters has been too weak. If Mr. Nakajima can reach a record of 50 seconds, there is hope for victory in the 400 meters. However, there is no certainty now. In addition to Nakajima, there are many athletes who can run 51 seconds, but they have no hope.</p>
<h3 id="e113">800 Meters <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Japan is the perennial winner in middle-distance running. This time, we can win the championship without resistance. The first-class athletes in the 800 meters are Mr. Hisatomi from Korea, Hamada from Manchuria, and Okada, Yashiba, and Takanishi from the country. There are also Fujiki, Kuranishi, and Kinouchi, who can be considered equals. There are not many good records in this congress, so the emergence of newcomers is expected. The above athletes have gained a lot of experience in the Japan-France and Japan-Germany confrontation competitions, and their performances are also good. Therefore, the championship of the 800 meters must not be given to others.</p>
<h3 id="e114">1500 Meters <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>It is difficult to determine who is the number one in this competition now, because the strengths are very similar. Judging from last year's records, we can first mention Tsuda, Kitamoto, and Nishi. Then there are Fujimoto, Kakutani, Hisatomi, and Nishiura. With so many good players, we can foresee Japan's complete victory and wait for the emergence of a new record.</p>
<h3 id="e115">10,000 Meters <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Japan has always won this event, and there is no question this time. Among Kitamoto, Tsuda, Morimoto, Kitakado, and Kusunoki, no one dares to predict who will win. Mr. Nagatani is the record holder for this event. It is very interesting to see if he will break his own record in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e116">High Hurdles <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Like short-distance running, the high hurdles have always been a failure. But this year, we should look at it differently. Mr. Miki, whom the European champion Germany could not break, will definitely bring the crown to Japan. Although much inferior to Mr. Miki, there are also Kijima, Tsuruoka, and Iwanaga. Before Miki takes the field, the activity of this group of good players can already have good results.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Low Hurdles <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>There is news that the 200-meter low hurdles will be changed to 400 meters this year, so it is difficult to predict this event. Japanese athletes Hasegawa, Kihakuki, Tanaka, Mayama, and Ki are new to this type of competition, which is somewhat unfavorable. This can be said to be an inevitable phenomenon in the transitional period.</p>
<h3 id="e118">High Jump <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The high jump is the most strenuous and hard-working of all competitions, because Mr. Toribio of the Philippines is very scary. He was elected fourth in the World Congress of the Netherlands and has a record of 1.95 meters. Although Mr. Kimura has a record of 1.94 meters, his strength is above Mr. Toribio's, but he has been defeated by him twice, inevitably making him feel timid. Kimura now has the advantage of being at home, and naturally has the determination to fight hard for victory. But the other party must also defend his original position. This battle between the two heroes is the only interesting and noteworthy event in the congress. No matter who wins, a world record will probably be produced. Following these two heroes, there are Ono, Nose, and more who can jump over 1.80 meters. Looking at Mr. Ono's struggle in the Japan-Germany competition, there is no problem in any case.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Long Jump <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Nambu's struggle in this event is probably not for the sake of the East Asian championship, but to become the second best in the world, a world-class athlete. Following this world-class athlete, although there are some poor</p>
<h3 id="e120">Shanghai women's basketball player Liang Lifang and the general secretary of the Sports Association Hao Boyang asked for help (Photo by Mr. Lin Zemin) <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>weak figures, there are also Toyama, Oshima, Nakajima, and Nishimura. I recall that at the Shanghai Congress, this event was won by an unexpected athlete who took second place. If the above players can show their strength and make a splash, complete victory is not impossible.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Pole Vault <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Japan's victory in this event is certain this year. Mr. Nishida's jump is gradually competing for the world record. The possibility of complete victory exists if he exceeds a height of 2.70 meters. The struggles of Mochizuki, Kanamori, Yamamoto, Asai, and Mori will bring great glory to Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Triple Jump <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The victory in this competition has long been a foregone conclusion. There are veteran players such as Nambu, Oshima, Toyama, and Shibata. If either Kimura or Nishida, who are gradually emerging, is selected, a complete victory can be achieved. Apart from Mr. Nambu, the first place naturally belongs to Mr. Kimura and Mr. Nishida.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Shot Put <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Japan's victory in the shot put is beyond doubt. The strength of pitcher Takada is recognized by everyone. This is naturally the reward for his long-term hard work. The weight of the shot put will be increased from 12 pounds to 16 pounds. Following Takada, there are Saito, Aono, Uchida, and Ishida. The strength of the Philippine army is unknown, but it is at least considerable. If you want to get a position in this event, you must reach a record of 13 meters to have hope.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Discus <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Although Itabashi and Saito can indeed exceed 40 meters, Okita, Tomita, Kuroda, Kunai, and Sekida also have the potential to break through 40 meters. A short-bodied French athlete who came to Japan the year before was able to throw 46 meters. Japanese athletes also have this possibility.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Javelin <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>In this competition, Japan has the possibility of complete victory. The first place should be given to Mr. Sumiyoshi, and there are also Kanzuma, Ito, Yamamoto, Ienaga, Abe, Usami, and Nishimura. Only those who have a record of more than 55 meters have</p>
<h3 id="e126">Yesterday morning, Shanghai female athletes (right) Wang Dale (left) Xiao Jiazhen reported at the North Station when they departed (Photo by Mr. Lin Zemin) <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>qualifications to compete against them. At the Shanghai Congress, although Mr. Sumiyoshi won, the others were not selected. This is something Japan is not happy about. If Japan can have four people who exceed 60 meters, then it can not only be the champion of the Far East, but also compete with the world.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Pentathlon <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The rules of the Far Eastern Games are that the pentathlon, decathlon, and relay race are combined into</p>
<p>one championship, and the remaining athletics competitions are another championship, so the pentathlon and decathlon competitions cannot be ignored. The active people in the pentathlon are Sumiyoshi, who won last year when he first appeared, and there are also Fujiguchi, Kuroda, and Ishibashi. Each country can have six people participate in this competition, but Japan cannot find anyone other than the above four. If Ienaga and Ito of Waseda University, and Itabashi of Keio University, are a little stronger in the 1,500-meter event and join the pentathlon, they will definitely succeed.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Decathlon <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Like the pentathlon, victory in the decathlon is generally attributed to Japan. Qi, Nishida, Koyama, Ikawa, and Yamagata are the most hopeful. They also won first and second place at the Shanghai Congress. Moreover, they now have the advantage of being at home, so dreaming of a complete victory is not impossible. In particular, Nishida's activity will undoubtedly occupy the first place in Japan in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e129">800-Meter Relay <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Since there are many talents in short distances, the relay race can definitely be won. It is expected that Japan will win the 800-meter relay and a new record will be produced. Ozawa, Yoshioka, Nakajima, Nishi, Abu, Nambu, and Yano are the backbone of this event. The most regrettable thing is that Mr. Murayama cannot participate due to illness. He once recorded 10.6 seconds, leaving the strong players such as Abu and Nishi five meters away. If he participated, victory in the 200-meter event would also be easy.</p>
<h3 id="e130">1600-Meter Relay <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>In this competition, Japan has only Mr. Nakajima, a 400-meter athlete, so we will inevitably face a tough battle. However, the relay race cannot be won solely by speed. Victory must have "harmony." Having said that, judging from the defeat in Shanghai last time, the victory this time will probably still belong to others.</p>
<p>The reporter noted that Oda's foot was injured due to competition, but it has now recovered. He may be able to attend the congress this time. His forte is the long jump and triple jump. Naturally, he should be added to the athletes he mentioned above in the triple jump and decathlon.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Overview of Education Expenditure by Various Countries <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Joint Office for the Preparation of Compulsory Education in various counties of Jiangsu Province has compiled statistics on the education expenditure borne by various countries. This serves as a reference for our country's promotion of compulsory education without allocated funding. The excerpt is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Germany: Previously, the central government provided 500 marks annually for each primary school principal and 300 marks annually for each primary school teacher. In 1895, the central government spent 82.2 million marks on primary school teachers' salaries alone, not including other various subsidies. After the European War, the central government took full responsibility for compulsory education expenses, spending approximately 400 million marks annually. Germany is only the size of a few provinces in China, yet the central government bears such a large burden, demonstrating its emphasis on compulsory education.</p>
<p>(2) England: The central government's contribution to compulsory education was 20,000 pounds in 1832. In 1839, it increased subsidies for various primary schools. In 1891, it contributed an average of ten shillings for each enrolled child. In 1895, the total contribution was 1,911,823 pounds, while the total expenditure for primary schools was only 11,371,052 pounds, demonstrating the substantial contribution from the central government. After the European War, the system was changed to a 50/50 split between the central and local governments, with the central government bearing an even greater burden.</p>
<p>(3) France: Since 1881, the salaries of primary school teachers have been subsidized with substantial funds allocated by the central</p>
<h3 id="e139">(Above) Rong Qiguang, Shanghai Municipal Athletics Overall Education (Below) Huang, Propaganda Committee Member of the General Assembly (Photograph by Mr. Lin Hanmin of the News Department of the Photographic Society) <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>government. After the enactment of the compulsory education law in 1882, the salaries of primary school teachers were entirely the responsibility of the central government. Local governments were only responsible for sporadic expenses such as school repairs and student supplies. In 1892, the central government's total contribution was 160,470,540 francs.</p>
<p>(4) Japan: Since the implementation of education in the fifth year of the Meiji era, the central government has borne the burden of subsidies annually, with increasing amounts each year. After the end of the European War, in response to the global trend, the central government's burden has increased even further. Starting from the seventh year of the Taisho era, the central government allocated 10 million yen annually. From the twelfth year, it allocated 40 million yen annually. (5) Russia: Compulsory education was not very developed in the past, but the central government's contribution was still considerable. After the revolution, the central government took full responsibility.</p>
<p>(6) United States: The contribution from state governments varies from 20% to 60%. The central government also provides a large amount of public land to local areas to be used as compulsory education funds.</p>
<p>(7) Denmark: The expenses for compulsory education in villages are entirely borne by the central government. The central government has also been responsible for the annual salary increases of primary school teachers for decades.</p>
<p>(8) Switzerland: Expenses are shared between local provinces and the central government. However, in addition to half of the regular salaries of primary school teachers, the central government is also responsible for annual salary increases.</p>
<p>(9) Netherlands: Originally, the central government was only responsible for pensions and survivor's benefits. However, since 1921, the central government has been responsible for the full amount of primary school teachers' salaries.</p>
<p>(10) Italy: In impoverished areas, the central government bears the full cost of primary school teachers' regular salaries and provides additional subsidies. The central government is fully responsible for pensions.</p>
<p>(11) Austria, Hungary, and Serbia: The central governments of these three countries bear the full amount of pensions, survivor's benefits, and child support for primary school teachers.</p>
<p>(12) Sweden: The central government is responsible for two-thirds of the regular salaries of primary school teachers and the full amount of pensions and survivor's benefits.</p>
<p>(13) Norway: The central government is responsible for one-half of the regular salaries of primary school teachers and the full amount of various subsidies.</p>
<p>(14) Finland: The central government bears the full amount of primary school teachers' base salaries and pensions.</p>
<p>(15) Spain and Portugal: The central governments bear the cost of various subsidies.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Construction of the National Central Research Institute <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Part of the institute's site has been surveyed at Qintian Mountain. The president is preparing for construction and has no intention of going north.</p>
<p>According to Guowenshe, news from the National Central Research Institute in this city indicates that the institute's sites in the capital were originally planned for Zijin Mountain, Beiji Pavilion, and Qingliang Mountain. The Astronomical Research Institute and Observatory are located on the third peak of Zijin Mountain (Tianbao City), and work on the mountain road has already begun and will be completed soon. The Meteorological Research Institute and Observatory are located at Qintian Mountain, Beiji Pavilion, and were built a year ago. Expansion is now being decided, with the construction of a library and seismograph room. The remaining major construction was originally planned for Qingliang Mountain, but due to budget limitations, it could not be realized earlier. Since receiving the order from the National Government to relocate to Beijing in its entirety, the institute has been actively proceeding, requesting the Capital Municipal Government to allocate land on Qingliang Mountain for sequential planning. However, due to the complexity of investigating private land and verifying deeds, transfer could not be completed immediately. As the institute was eager to begin construction, it had to proceed with a portion of the site on the eastern slope of Qintian Mountain, Beiji Pavilion. It is heard that President Cai Yuanpei has hired a famous Shanghai architect to go to Beijing to design with General Secretary Yang Xingfo. The first phase of road construction and leveling work has been surveyed and will be put out for tender soon. The entire construction project should be completed by autumn. President Cai of the institute has recently been involved in planning construction and relocation matters and has no intention of traveling north. Reports of him going to Ping are completely inaccurate.</p>

<p>The Joint Association of Teachers and Staff of Jiangsu Provincial Middle Schools issued a telegram stating: "To all newspapers in Shanghai and colleagues in the education sector throughout the province, we have recently learned that the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office, after discussion by the education, finance, commerce, and industry departments, has been renamed the Beijing-Shanghai-Jiangsu Provincial and Municipal Education Funding Management Office. It has also been decided to transfer Shanghai Provincial Middle School to the jurisdiction of Shanghai Special Municipality, undermining the independence of Jiangsu's education funds, encroaching on provincial education institutions, and hindering the overall development of provincial education.

Therefore, the Department of Library Administration will be launched first, with lectures prepared by executive committee member Chen Bokui and others.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Love Remains, Remember Leiyang <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Yu'an</p>
<p>Our country has a vast territory, with more than twenty provinces. There are nearly two thousand county seats. Almost no one can list the names of each county. However, place names from the Three Kingdoms period are known even by three-foot-tall children who can read Romance of the Three Kingdoms, or even by those who are illiterate but familiar with Beijing opera from the Three Kingdoms period. For example, Dangyang County in Hubei Province is famous for the play "The Battle of Changban Slope." Changsha County in Hunan Province is famous for Guan Yu's battle with Huang Zhong. Mianzhu County in Sichuan Province is famous for Zhuge Zhan's martyrdom. Also, Jiange County is famous for Zhang He's ambush. Other counties such as Langzhong, Tianshui, Huarong, and Gongan are all talked about by the Chinese people. In comparison to today, Fenghua Xikou in Zhejiang Province, although a small town, was known by very few people until Jiang Jieshi came from there, and its name became well-known. This is what is known as "a place is known through its people." Today, the Leiyang I am writing about is also a famous place from the Three Kingdoms period, as popular as Dangyang and Changsha, enduring for tens of thousands of years.</p>
<p>Leiyang was established in the Han Dynasty. It was promoted to a prefecture in the Yuan Dynasty. It remained a county in the Ming Dynasty. In the Qing Dynasty, it belonged to Hengzhou Prefecture in Hunan. In the third year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Interior of Yuan Shikai's government redefined administrative regions and reassigned it to Hengyang Circuit in Hunan. Today, the circuit system has been abolished, and it is directly a county in Hunan. Its popularity is due to the fact that Pang Tong once governed this county during the Three Kingdoms period, and Zhang Huanhou (Zhang Fei) once visited it. To this day, Leiyang still retains the relics of Pang and Zhang, preserved and immortal. The most famous are the Phoenix Chick Pavilion (Pang's nickname was Phoenix Chick) and the stone-carved horse trough. The pavilion is behind the county government and has gradually become dilapidated over the past thousand years. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Chen Zijia, the county magistrate, fearing its oblivion, donated his own funds to renovate it, restoring it to its former appearance. There is a couplet that reads, "A hundred miles was not originally a place for the Phoenix to dwell, but temporarily served as Crouching Dragon Ridge." It is quite well-written and apt. The horse trough is a relic of Huanhou. It is said that when Pang arrived in the county, he did not handle any affairs. The First Lord (Liu Bei) was angry and sent Huanhou to inspect. Huanhou carved the trough to feed his steed. The trough is about four feet long, one and a half feet wide, and a little over a foot deep. It is carved with very fine patterns. A stele was erected next to it, inscribed with the words: "Distant Huanhou, with a spirit that endures for eternity. The stone trough feeds the horse, leaving behind love. Loyalty and integrity are immortal, and his spirit is equal to the gods. Cherishing the past, our thoughts wander." There is also the Horse Washing Pond, which, together with the horse trough and the Phoenix Chick Pavilion, forms a tripod. It was where Huanhou washed his horse at the time. A friend of mine, Mr. Mou, told me about this. Mr. Mou had personally visited the place. Examining the official history, Pang Tong was from Xiangyang, Shu Han, in the Three Kingdoms period. His courtesy name was Shiyuan. Sima Hui called him the crown of scholars in Nanzhou. The First Lord sent him to govern Leiyang, but he did not govern. Lu Su said, "Shiyuan is not a talent for a hundred-mile post. He should be placed in the position of administrative assistant." The First Lord summoned him to serve as an adjutant and followed him into Shu. He was struck by a stray arrow and died. The Romance is slightly different, saying that Tong governed the county for several months, only drinking wine. When drunk, he would sleep. When Huanhou came, he was still untidy and met him while still drunk. Huanhou rebuked him for disgracing his mission, almost to the point of punishment. Pang then handled the accumulated cases in a few hours, distinguishing right from wrong, with no one wronged. Huanhou was amazed and impressed. The historical record directly states that he did not govern, regardless of whether it was going south by driving the chariot north. However, the fact that he once governed Leiyang, unlike most other historical relics that are largely unfounded, can be definitively confirmed.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Anecdotes of Chen Jiageng <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiping</p>
<p>Chen Jiageng, an overseas Chinese in Nanyang, is the most enthusiastic educator of our time and also the most substantial industrialist among overseas Chinese investors. Mr. Chen started his business with rubber and amassed tens of millions of dollars. He did not want to imitate the miserly hoarders despised by the world, accumulating wealth for his descendants, nor could he bear the decline of education in his motherland and the increasing cultural backwardness. Therefore, he advocated the theory of "saving the country through education" and was willing to spend his private property to work hard for the culture of his motherland. I lived in Xiamen for several years and heard and saw a lot about Mr. Chen's words and deeds. I will recount one or two things to fill the Free Talk.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Chen embraced the determination to "save the country through education," he has never slackened in the past twenty years. Today's nationally renowned Jimei Schools and Xiamen University are successful stories in his ideal. Jimei is a collective term for eight schools, including a kindergarten, primary school, kindergarten normal school, boys' and girls' middle schools, agriculture, commerce, and fisheries. The tall buildings and schools are lined up neatly, forming a beautiful school village. Xiamen University is divided into five colleges: literature, science, education, law, and commerce. Famous scholars and talents gather here. The equipment and buildings are all top-notch. In total, the two schools have cost nearly ten million dollars, of which overseas Chinese have only generously donated more than 300,000. Among the overseas Chinese in southern Fujian who possess huge wealth like Chen Jiageng, there are more than just a few dozen. However, only Mr. Chen is able to generously donate and make plans for a century.</p>
<p>When asked by some about the purpose of running schools, Mr. Chen said, "My lifelong wish is nothing else. The money comes from me, and it should also go from me." His words were weighty and worthy of savoring. In recent years, the price of rubber has fallen, and his business is not as prosperous as it used to be. Currently, his monthly profit is only 100,000, and he sets aside half of it for the regular expenses of the two schools. Alas, how generous! I remember when a student strike occurred at Xiamen University, and it dragged on unresolved. Mr. Chen solemnly stated, "If we agree, we stay. If we don't agree, we leave. Why force it? Even if Xiamen University has only one teacher and one student, it will continue as usual. I will never let this hinder my determination to run schools." Eventually, some professors and students voluntarily left the school, and the strike subsided. The school continued as before.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen has a kind nature. The year before last, one of his main factories in Singapore was destroyed by fire, and more than a thousand workers lost their jobs and had no food or clothing. Mr. Chen specially allowed them to continue to receive their salaries as usual. It took four months to recover, and he never showed any reluctance. There are over five thousand workers in the various departments of his main factory. Mr. Chen himself serves as the general manager, but he works hard all year round, no different from the workers. He even calls himself a foreman. He enters the factory every morning at eight o'clock, inspecting each department. He is familiar with the principles and operation of all the machinery. He does not return home until six o'clock in the evening. People say that he enters before the workers and leaves after the workers, showing a spirit of not fearing hardship or difficulty, which is truly admirable.</p>
<p>In Singapore, Mr. Chen operates numerous industries, including rubber, candy, medicine, shoes, and hats. His most famous business is the Chen Jiageng Company, which has branches all over the world, totaling forty-eight, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e148">A Record of the Painting Banquet at Shi Shizhai <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— He Tianjian</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Renbai, the host of Shi Shizhai, held a banquet for the members of the Honeybee Society at Shi Shizhai yesterday. All the members arrived by 7 p.m. The host's hospitality was very generous. After entering the banquet, the conversation turned to the origins of Western painting in Shanghai. Wang Shizi said that his teacher, Zhou Xiangshi, was its pioneer, about twenty years ago. Zhou founded the Art and Book School in Shanghai. At that time, Liu Haisu and others were all students of the school. Shizi was also one of them. Sun Xueni continued, saying that Zhou Xiang is currently in Jiangwan, in a very difficult situation. He once created a very fine painting of a hundred children, seeking to sell it to a certain company for a price of one hundred gold. The company offered fifty, but he refused. In his distress, he sought to sell it again. The company deliberately suppressed the price, lowering it to thirty. He refused. In his distress, he sought to sell it again. The company suppressed the price to fifteen gold. Helpless, he sold it. Those who heard this all lamented for him. Mr. Zhou was truly a meritorious person in introducing Western treasures to Jiyuan, but now he has lost both fame and fortune, living in obscurity. Isn't it frightening? After the banquet was cleared, the host set out painting tools in preparation. A large canvas was unfurled. Daqian first painted a person, and Shanzai painted a tiger, crouching beside the person. Shizi painted a book on the tiger's forehead. Its meaning is profound. Yutie painted a futon. I added a precarious wall. Zheng Bai added a stone slope. Wuchang added distant peaks. Xueni added lingzhi. The members also wanted me to write a poem. The poem reads, "Entering the market, I fear becoming a fox in power. Living in the mountains, I can accompany myself in song. My companions each have their own merits. When the divine brush comes, there is no need to fear spring." It was a hasty work, barely passable. I then painted two portraits of officials. Shanzai, Xueni, Wuchang, Zheng Bai, and Weixin added scenery. Fellow member Mr. Liu painted a painting of chicks. Xueni, Wuchang, Shizi, and Weixin each made fan albums and hand scrolls, all of which were exquisite works. It was already midnight when it was finished.</p>

<p>— Lai</p>
<p>Starting from Seattle, railway staff accompanied and escorted me along the way. A special car was added. Railway staff treated me to meals every day. During the journey, I repeatedly received telegrams from various parties expressing their regards and welcoming me. Upon arrival in Chicago, the general manager of the railway company, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the reporters from May's Public Records, and various newspaper reporters came to welcome me. They also wanted me to stay for a day, but I politely declined. I immediately transferred to a train to New York. At the station, the Consul General, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and representatives from various associations and organizations were there to welcome me. There were also hundreds of students from Chinese overseas primary schools singing specially made welcome songs. More than ten newspaper reporters were sent to take photos. There were thousands of spectators on the platform. A special path was created and roped off. Six police officers were dispatched to escort me. As soon as I left the platform, the doors were closed until everyone had seen me off and boarded the car. The police took care of me along the way and escorted me to the Consul General's car. I received more than sixty bouquets of flowers. The car was decorated with both Chinese and American flags. Yunhua rode in it to the Palasa Hotel. At the Plaza Hotel, reporters and photographers gathered at once. More than ten representatives from May's came to take care of everything. After much commotion, I was finally able to rest.</p>
<p>Since arriving here, I have been invited by various organizations and famous actors to watch plays or rehearsals. They have all expressed their warm welcome. Mr. Bolasro, a leading figure in the theater world, was ill at the time but sent a letter of welcome from the hospital, expressing his admiration. Many other famous actors from various cities also sent letters. Several people in the theater world are willing to help without pay. For example, Mr. Eatl Cawrll, the owner of a large theater, came to arrange the lighting without accepting any compensation. Such examples are too numerous to list. Their kindness is truly appreciated, and it shows the enthusiasm with which the Americans welcome me.</p>
<p>Since Yunhua's performance the day before yesterday, the audience has been unanimously satisfied. In the first play, "Fen River Bend," only the section after entering the kiln was performed. After the performance, the audience applauded loudly, calling for a curtain call five times. In the second play, "Green Stone Mountain," Zhu Guifen and Yun Lianrong performed together. Zhu was also well-received after the performance. In the third play, "Stealing the Box," Yunhua only performed the sword dance section. They called for a curtain five times, so she performed another section. After a ten-minute break, May and Lianrong performed "Assassinating the Tiger," which was especially well-received. The curtain was called up to fifteen times, a rare event in the theater. Dozens of flower baskets were presented. The great success of the two plays, "Fen River Bend" and "Assassinating the Tiger," is truly gratifying. They briefly embody the inherent Chinese virtues of loyalty, integrity, courage, and righteousness. They also fully demonstrate the true spirit of Chinese drama. It is also worth noting that the audience highly praised Chinese music. The next day, all the newspapers gave positive reviews. For example, the Times, which usually does not pay attention to drama, suddenly published a review, occupying two large columns. The New York World wrote, "I can only understand five percent of May's play. As far as I know, I dare not say that it is error-free. However, after watching it for only three minutes, I was very satisfied."</p>

<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>André Derain (D)</p>
<p>"All Egyptian, Greek, and Italian Renaissance works are worthy of my admiration. But thousands and thousands of modern works are not. As for the works of our contemporaries, let's not discuss them for now."</p>
<p>Initially, everyone was unforgiving of Derain's classical realism. This classical realism is nothing more than a love for nature. He spent his life exploring the mysteries of nature, striving to paint the true image of green. Monet's paintings of landscapes only show flowers and plants covered in sunlight. Derain's paintings of landscapes are the fundamental expression of nature itself. His still life paintings give the first impression of solid structure and emotion. When we look at his fruits, pots, and rags, they are not only depictions, but also organized as accurately and scientifically as building a house—there is only the beauty of matter. He wants to create a sense of three-dimensionality on the canvas through the contrast and coordination of "planes." Critics, coming from the old doctrines of the first twenty-five years of the twentieth century, complained that he was insulting a generation of masters, imitating a primitive style. But his return to origins was only in conflict with the decadent forms of soft art—all imitative tendencies towards shifting and indefinite emotions. In short, both Fauvism and Cubism are symbolic in their aesthetic sense. This symbolism was first discovered in literature and then spread to painting. Previously, painters advocated for the similarity, equivalence, and metaphor of natural appearances. This empty intellectualism, because it is too subjective and abstract, will only increase the chaos in the art world.</p>
<p>Derain, in order to restore the objectivity that had been lost in painting, reconnected with the tradition of pure painting. This tradition was gradually being destroyed by decorative fantasy.</p>
<p>All those who stay in Paris to study literature and art, whether or not they agree, must focus on Derain's life. He was born in Charou on June 10, 1880. After receiving a very complete education in his youth, he prepared to apply to the École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures, hoping to become an engineer in the future. But analyzing abstract things like time and space with mathematics was not suitable for Derain, who had too much talent. Eventually, he was attracted to painting. Like all geniuses, he was surprisingly precocious. At the age of fifteen, he had already created many paintings. He was very dismissive of everything. When the issues of Fauvism and Cubism arose, he once stood up and said, "I have been more Cubist than others..."</p>
<p>Yes, his works from twenty years ago can still be seen everywhere in Paris. They are indeed Cubist, even more so than others... But for him, it never took away life from free creation and turned it into hardened Cubist dogma. Among the great figures in the modern European art world, the one who can inherit Cézanne's true meaning and open up new starting points, becoming the legitimate teacher in the history of art, is probably Derain.</p>
<p>Because he lived in Charou, he met Vlaminck in his youth. Vlaminck was his neighbor and became his closest painter. At one time, Derain was often in Carrière's studio. Some places still contained Carrière's secrets. Later, he met Matisse, Marquet, Braque, Dufy, Friege, etc. They united to form Fauvism to rebel</p>
<p>against Impressionist painting. All the new things in modern European aesthetics were born out of the spirit of "anti-Impressionism."</p>

<p>Customs Duty Consolidation Continues to Rise Significantly, Other Bonds Also Remain Strong</p>
<p>Market Conditions Remain Good, Total Weekly Transactions Exceed 35 Million</p>
<p>Last week, the bond market situation in the local securities market saw slight activity in spot trading. A total of 221,500 yuan was opened for the week, including 97,000 yuan for Consolidation, 44,000 yuan for Continued, 26,000 yuan for Customs Duty (Continued 251,900 yuan), 15,000 yuan for Finance, 14,500 yuan for Rehabilitation, and only a few thousand yuan for the Seven-Year Consolidation 6. There were still no transactions for 96. Futures trading remained active. Despite being before and after the end-of-month settlement, various parties entered and exited the market briskly. Except for Friday, when trading was suspended for settlement, 8 million yuan was opened on Monday and Saturday, and 6.8 to 6.9 million yuan was opened on Wednesday and Thursday. Only 5.7 million yuan was opened on Tuesday. Statistics show that 35.05 million yuan was traded, a decrease of 5 million yuan compared to the previous week. Among them, Customs Duty was the most active in the market, accounting for 14.8 million yuan, divided into 1.095 million yuan for the March term, 10.41 million yuan for the April term, and 3.035 million yuan for the May term. Rehabilitation and Continued were the next most active. Rehabilitation accounted for 1.18 million yuan for the March term, 4.03 million yuan for the April term, and 1.995 million yuan for the May term. Continued accounted for 1.035 million yuan for the March term, 3.35 million yuan for the April term, and 665,000 yuan for the May term. Consolidation trading gradually became active, accounting for 100,500 yuan for the March term, 2.9005 million yuan for the April term, and 565,000 yuan for the May term. The Six-Percent Consolidation accounted for 450,000 yuan for the March term, 1.645 million yuan for the April term, and 490,000 yuan for the May term. The market situation for Continued 25 was far inferior to before, accounting for 400,000 yuan for the March term, 1.15 million yuan for the April term, and 155,000 yuan for the May term. Other bonds were very quiet, such as Seven-Year bonds at only 280,000 yuan, Finance at 355,000 yuan, and 96 at only 655,000 yuan. As for the changes in the various bonds during the past week, although the market situation was good in the first two days of the week, the supply and demand forces were very balanced, and prices saw both increases and decreases. The trend was still peaceful. On Wednesday, the March term was suspended to prepare for settlement, but the market's demand for Consolidation and Customs Duty was very strong, and investment buying was very strong. The price of Consolidation futures rose nearly 3 yuan, and the spot prices of Consolidation and Customs Duty also rose by about 2 yuan. Other bonds, except for the fixed prices of 96 and Finance, all rose by 70 to 80 cents to several yuan. After the settlement on Thursday, the May term of futures was opened for trading, and the market was slightly flat. Bond prices saw both increases and decreases, with small amounts. However, after the settlement on Friday, the buying sentiment in the market turned smooth again. Consolidation rebounded sharply by 2 yuan, Customs Duty continued to rise by about 1 yuan, and other bonds also rose by 50 to 60 cents. Only 96 and Seven-Year bonds were sluggish and did not see major changes. As a result, the prices of all bonds continued to rise across the board compared to the previous week. Among them, the spot and futures prices of Consolidation and the futures and spot prices of Customs Duty for Rehabilitation saw the largest gains. The others all rose by 1 yuan to 1.6 to 1.7 yuan. 96 and Finance saw almost no changes. The statistics of the high, low, and fluctuations of the prices of various bonds during the week are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton The Yarn Market Trended Down Last Week</p>
<p>Yarn Fell by 2.23 Taels This Month, Spot Yarn Price Fell by 1 Tael or More.</p>
<p>The yarn market showed a significant decline last week. As the inventory of basic goods gradually thickened, with 30-count Five Blessings Shepherd yarn accumulating to 15,000 to 16,000 bales, buyers viewed the overall situation as unfavorable and the political situation as chaotic. Sellers, on the other hand, were well prepared and had to painfully close out positions. As a result, the market atmosphere suddenly changed. 客帮 (merchant groups) reduced their purchasing volume because farmers in various rural areas were about to be busy with field work, and they were also discouraged by the poor performance of yarn futures. Fortunately, the overseas flower yarn market was still firm. However, based on actual estimates, there was too much inventory and insufficient demand, making it difficult for prices to rise significantly at present. Among the 客帮, those from Guangdong, Qingdao, and Xuzhou bought the most, while others were flat. Statistics show that the total number of bales bought by all 客帮 on a single day was only 6,805 bales, with 2,400 bales bought by fellow traders. Market prices fell by 1 tael or more. The futures market for yarn was trending down due to the thick accumulation of basic goods and the lack of interest from buyers in taking delivery. The near month fell below the 50 tael mark. As a result, this month's prices fell by 2.23 taels compared to the previous week, and the distant month fell by 1 tael or more. The total weekly trading volume was 95,600 bales. Osaka's three yarn products rose by 3 to 4 yuan. The purchase amounts of each 客帮 are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e154">Cotton Market Remained Stable Last Week <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The overall trend of the cotton market remained firm, mainly because American cotton was stable, the inventory of local cotton was relatively thin, and the supply from various sources was lacking. The attitude of the Hankou merchants was strong, pulling in goods without releasing them. Fortunately, the current demand for cotton from various factories was not strong, so the market prices did not trend upwards. However, the sluggish yarn market inevitably had a slight impact on the cotton market. The prices of label cotton for each month fell by 3 to 4 cents compared to last week. The total weekly trading volume was 159,100 dan. The supply at the wharf included 1,000 bales of Yao cotton and 3,900 bales of common cotton. Manufacturers purchased 14,980 dan, and trading firms purchased 538 dan. American cotton rose by 15 points compared to the previous week. The purchase amounts of manufacturers and trading firms are listed below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton rose due to favorable news from Liverpool. Later, the market became more expensive due to purchases by spot merchants and short covering. Futures prices rose by 10 to 12 points, and spot prices rose by 10 points. British cotton futures rose by 6 to 7 points, and spot prices rose by 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. Indian cotton was weak due to sales by brokers. 平果爾(Pingguoer) futures remained unchanged, while奥姆辣(Aomula) and 白羅溪(Bailuoxi) near and far futures both fell by 1 rupee.

<h3 id="e156">Worthy of Great Attention The Soviet Cotton Planting Movement <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Soviet Russia has been vigorously promoting cotton planting, and it is expected that cotton production will be sufficient for its own use in two years and that there will be the possibility of exporting and selling in five years. According to the US-Russian Chamber of Commerce monthly report in November last year, the Russian Labor Conference ordered that the cotton fields under contract in 1930 should be 3.65 million acres, an increase of 489,500 acres compared to 1929, and should produce 1.953 million bales of cotton. It also ordered the Ministry of Agriculture to supply 2,200 tractors to various cotton-planting areas before February 1, 1930, and to transport 410,000 tons of grain to various areas for the needs of farmers. The conference also ordered the Cotton Trust to pay attention to supplying farmers with the best available cotton seeds, and especially to pay attention to the organization of government and public cotton fields. It also purchased sufficient mineral fertilizers for the needs of 750,000 acres in Central Asia and 140,000 acres in the Caucasus. It also ordered agricultural implement factories to allocate 42,000 cotton hoes, 18,500 plows, and 15,000 seeders before February 1, 1930, for distribution. At least 820 tons each of Egyptian cotton seeds and American cotton seeds must be transported out. Cotton ginning factories must work for at least 10 months each year, and cottonseed oil factories must work for 360 days each year. In 1930, 5 large-scale cotton ginning factories, 5 cotton farmer ginning factories, 2 cottonseed oil factories, and 3 baling factories must be established. 280 experimental fields must be set up in Central Asia, and 47 experimental fields must be set up in the Transcaucasus. The total area of ​​cotton fields to be opened in each field for experimentation is 90,000 acres, and 240 cotton planting experts will be assigned to provide guidance separately. A special school must be opened in Tashkent to enroll 3,000 students to teach cotton planting knowledge. The operating expenses are US$26 million, plus US$10 million for training expenses. It is also said that the regional members dispatched by the headquarters of the Russian Cotton Trust, investigating the cotton planting areas in Ukraine, have determined that Guleson, Wadessa, and Nikolaevsk are suitable for cotton. The Ministry of Agriculture will open 6,300 acres of cotton land in Ukraine for trial planting in the next season. The committee investigating the possibility of expanding cotton planting in Central Asia has determined that the number of acres of cotton land planned in the five-year planting plan can be easily realized, as long as the agency designated to implement this plan actively carries it out. It also advocates that all cotton-planting areas must be provided with financial good seeds, flour, and utensils. In addition, an organization of 37,500 acres of cooperative cotton planting has been established in 境外曼(Jingwai Man) in Krasnodar. The government promised to supply the necessary equipment and be responsible for maintenance and repair, etc. From this, it can be seen that Russia is actively engaged in the cotton planting movement. The leader of the world cotton market will have another layer [of competition].</p>
<h3 id="e157">Grain Market River Lower Rice Market Stockpile Getting Scarce <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, there were fewer than ten ships from the River Lower (region), and the inventory was only enough for dozens more. Moreover, half of them were small, bottom-laden boats, so the actual quantity was very small. Buyers' appetite remained sluggish, while sellers were completely focused on selling. Transactions of Northern Japonica rice were extremely small. The market price was similar to the previous session at 20 yuan, and there was no possibility of a rebound in the near future. If the supply from the River Lower remains scarce, the people's food supply will definitely be affected. Sales of thin indica rice were flat with no increase or decrease. The inventory of Yangdu indica rice was also exhausted, and transactions were quiet with prices remaining firm. Bianyuan (rice from 揚州 Yangzhou) has also felt a decline recently, and sales are brisk. There is a severe shortage of high-quality rice on the market. Top-quality and mid-quality rice reached 17.7 to 17.8 yuan, and the situation is quite good.</p>
<p>沪南 (South Shanghai): The number of ships from the River Lower was also scarce, and the inventory of each store was not strong, although it was thicker than that of Zhabei. Each store with Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Tongxiang Japonica rice, transactions were acceptable, and the market price was stable. However, mid-quality and second-quality rice has already risen to the status of ordinary rice. This is also a clear and definite tightening of the market. The thin indica rice from Chonggu and Qingjiao in 南路 (South Road), as well as the early indica rice from Tinglin and Feilai Feng, were also sold as soon as they arrived, and the number of shi increased sharply. Most of the transactions were in mid-quality goods, and high-quality goods did not seem to be worthwhile and were also extremely scarce. The situation was stable. The route for 羊秈(Yang indica) and 埠秈(Bu indica) rice was smooth, and the supply of northern goods remained scarce. Southern goods were very popular with buyers, and prices were slightly firm. It seems that they will not follow the trend of 洋米 (imported rice) due to the current shortage of goods, and the authorities are investigating strictly, so it is difficult to raise prices. The trend of 通變陰元(Tongbian Yinyuan, kind of rice) turned bullish, due to the small amount of arrival, and the alcohol appetite continued to move. The market was tight due to the need for use.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Silk and Tea Last Week, Factory Business Was Very Brisk <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Existing Cocoons Unable to Continue to New, Current Silk Supply Not Meeting Demand</p>
<p>Last week, the Shanghai silk market continued to be firm, stemming from the fact that since the lifting of the gold embargo in Japan, Yokohama Japanese silk has repeatedly plummeted. The Japanese government, fearing that it would affect international trade, allocated 5 to 6 million to facilitate funds, protect silk prices, and expand silk storage. It has been more than half a month since the implementation. The gold market has risen more than it has fallen, and Japanese silk prices have risen higher and higher. European and American stores still find Japanese silk prices expensive and lack sufficient appetite for purchases. With the calculated price of Chinese silk, factory purchasing intentions are stronger. The silk telegram to Shanghai was not weak during the week. However, the estimated cocoon storage in Shanghai warehouses is only enough for silk reeling until the end of April. The current silk supply cannot meet demand, and market prices are even more brisk. Total weekly trading volume was 600 to 700 bales. Chinese silk exports were extremely smooth. As the inspection period of April 1 was approaching, all existing silk was actively loaded out. A total of more than 2,500 pieces were shipped to Europe, America, and France throughout the week. Overseas Chinese silk generally trended upwards. The market prices of Chinese silk in the overseas market at the end of last week are listed below (New York price per pound, unit: gold dollar; Lyon price per kilogram, unit: franc):</p>
<p>Silk Category 	New York 	Lyon 	Silk Category 	New York 	Lyon</p>
<p>High Quality Shanghai Silk	5.62	363	High Quality Dried Silk 	3.55	214</p>
<p>High Quality Flowing Silk 	5.23	308	Medium Quality Dried Silk 	3.05	179</p>

<p>祁門紅茶(Qimen black tea) and 浮梁紅茶(Fuliang black tea): In the blink of an eye, the Qingming Festival is approaching. According to the usual practice, each company enters the mountains at this time to open the market. Many original companies this year are taking a wait-and-see attitude because they suffered heavy losses last year. In addition, since the Shanghai 乾記茶棧(Qianji Tea Shop) was shut down, credit has been extremely tight. Companies lacking sufficient capital have inevitably been stranded due to this influence. Companies that do not rely on advance payments from 乾記茶棧(Qianji Tea Shop) are optimistic. If the tea shops do not loosen the exchange rates in the future, and the number of tea companies decreases, the mountain expenses this year may be reduced compared to the past, and there will be no competitive price increases. Currently, the 洲園茶(Zhouyuan tea) in both areas has already revealed the leaf tips. If the weather is sunny and the rainfall is even, it can be picked after the Qingming Festival.</p>

<p>Farewell Between Japanese Consul and Judge Sun Yuan</p>
<p>The Consular Observation System Will Be Abolished From Tomorrow</p>
<p>Today is Monday. The Provisional Court still has consuls attending court for observation. From tomorrow (April 1), the court will be reorganized into a Special District Local Court, and this consular observation system will be abolished from now on. Among the consuls attending, Japanese Consul Mr. Hasegawa often co-attended with Judge Sun Yuan. Therefore, his relationship with Judge Sun was especially close. During the year or more of observation, no differences of opinion occurred between the two sides. Recently, as the end of the consular observation system was approaching, and as he himself would be taking leave to return home for a trip, the Japanese consul specially took advantage of the Xinghualou Restaurant on the 4th Avenue to invite Judge Sun to a farewell dinner. Lawyer Ru Baoyi and translator Jiang Baoliang from the Detective Bureau were also invited to the banquet. There were many farewell speeches during the dinner. An ancient person said that the only thing that made one feel downhearted was farewell. This could be transferred to the occasion. On the afternoon of the 28th, Mr. Hasegawa was on his last day of observation. After leaving the court, he returned to the rest room to say goodbye to Mr. Sun, with a great deal of reluctance. It is expected that after the other consuls attend court for observation today, they will also have a sense of farewell from now on.</p>

<p>The Japanese First Fleet's Torpedo Squadron, departed from Sasebo around 6:00 AM yesterday, arriving at Wusong. None of the ships docked; they proceeded directly to Shanghai. The arriving ships included the destroyers of the 13th Division: *Warabi*, *Wutake*, *Wakatake*, *Sanae*; the 15th Division: *Hagi*, *Kuzu*, *Susuki*, *Fuji*; the 16th Division: *Yugao*, *Kari*, *Asagao*, *Fuyo*; and the 27th Division: *Hish*, *Tsuga*, *Saki*, totaling fifteen vessels. At 9:15 AM, the flagship *Naka* arrived, led by Rear Admiral Goto Akira. After arriving at Wusong, our country's Hai Rong warship, stationed in the Three Gorges, fired a salute in welcome. The *Naka* returned the salute. The ships then arrived in Shanghai at 11:00 AM. All of the ships are docked in the Huangpu River.

<p>The Fifth District Party Headquarters of this city issued a declaration yesterday opposing Japanese warships coming to China, stating: "The sixteen ships of the First Torpedo Squadron of the Japanese First Fleet, including the warship *Naka*, were ordered by the Japanese government to sail from Sasebo Naval Port to China the day before yesterday. They are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today (the 30th). The fleet carries 2,800 officers and soldiers, and its purpose is to practice navigating the Yangtze River. Therefore, after arriving in Shanghai, they will sail into the Yangtze River on the first day of next month, passing Nanjing, Daye, Hankou, and other places along the river. In the local newspapers of this port on the 30th, this startling news suddenly appeared. It is already a great humiliation for foreign ships to be allowed to navigate freely in our country's inland rivers. Now, the Japanese government is going even further, ordering a large number of warships and a large number of troops to sail into the Yangtze River region of our country, calling it 'practicing navigation,' but in reality, it is exploring our country's military situation and defenses in order to achieve its aggressive purposes. Otherwise, why would they use more than ten warships and more than two thousand armed soldiers to enter our country in a grandiose manner? Their contempt for our country's sovereignty is an obvious fact. If this is tolerable, what is not tolerable? Moreover, at this time, when the central government is making its final decisive battle with reactionary warlords like Yan Xishan, how important are national defense and military intelligence? How can we allow the armed forces of imperialism to penetrate deep into our country to carry out reconnaissance and demonstrations, thus compounding the disaster for the Party and the country? All of us Chinese people vow to resist. We must know that our people are no longer the ignorant and unconscious people of the past. Today's people deeply understand the meaning of revolution and will resolutely resist any unreasonable oppression by imperialism in order to seek their own liberation. This association dares to represent the people of the entire district and solemnly declares that it will resolutely oppose the arrival of a large number of Japanese warships to China this time. We will never give up until Japan automatically withdraws its warships. It is hoped that all circles will rise up and respond, expand their strength, and urge the government to lodge a serious protest. The Party and the country are fortunate! This is our declaration."</p>

<h3 id="e172">Negotiations to Lift the British Ban on the Import of Chinese Lard <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Commodity Inspection Bureau Sends Letter to British Government Requesting Lifting of the Ban</p>
<p>Lard is one of China's export products, with annual sales to the United Kingdom exceeding 2 million yuan. However, in recent years, the United Kingdom has banned its import, citing that Chinese lard has not been inspected. The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau believes that this matter affects China's foreign trade and should be remedied as soon as possible. Previously, it sent a letter to the British Minister of Health, informing him that China had established a Commodity Inspection Bureau, and that all export commodities must be inspected before being allowed to be exported. The Ministry forwarded the letter to the British Embassy in China, which sent Commercial Counsellor Jameson to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to investigate everything. Director Zou led him to inspect the entire bureau and sent personnel to accompany him to the Health Bureau, slaughterhouses, and lard factories to conduct on-site inspections, which were very satisfactory. Now, the bureau has sent another letter to Counsellor Jameson, emphatically stating that lard exported in Shanghai has undergone pre-slaughter and post-slaughter inspections by the Shanghai Municipal Government and that veterinarians commissioned by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau perform the final inspection during oil production and export, strictly adhering to the British regulations for lard imports in every aspect. The British government should urgently lift this ban to enhance friendship. It is expected that a satisfactory reply will be received within two months.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Stamp Tax Branch to Conduct Inspections Tomorrow <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Letter Sent to Public Security Bureau Requesting Assistance</p>
<p>Zhao Zuzhang, Director of the Shangbao Stamp Tax Branch, has observed that the sales of Shangbao stamp tax tickets have recently been flourishing, indicating that the business community is happy to purchase and affix them for national taxes. However, under-stamping or failure to stamp may still occur. Therefore, the director has decided to implement inspections starting on April 1st. He has already printed a large number of notices, posted them on thoroughfares to inform various businesses to purchase and affix sufficient stamps on all books, records, and discounts. At the same time, he sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau, requesting that it order the heads of each district to dispatch police officers to assist during the stamp tax inspections. The letter stated, "To instruct compliance: It is hereby ordered that the supervisors of the various districts comply with the following matter. According to a letter from the Jianghai Customs Supervisory Office, received from Director of Customs Mei, the Customs has seized thirty loads, eighty-two catties and ten taels of confiscated opium in the 278th term. In addition, there are morphine pills and other items, estimated to be worth 324.58 silver dollars, and opium lamps, estimated to be worth 246.50 silver dollars. It is scheduled to burn the aforementioned opium, etc., at the kiln in Lujiazui, Pudong, on April 4th at 9:00 AM. We have enclosed a list and ask you to forward it to various agencies and dispatch members to supervise on site and military police to guard the site. Please also reply to us." It is hereby instructed that the district chief comply immediately and go to supervise the burning at the designated time and send officers to maintain order. The police officer's meals are still self-supplied. This is the order.</p>

<p>The Shanghai French Concession Municipal Council, in order to prevent the occurrence of epidemic meningitis, issued a notice yesterday stating: "Upon investigation, meningitis has reappeared in Shanghai. Dr. Anhe, the head of the Health Department of this concession, has requested that the methods for preventing this epidemic disease and the symptoms of the disease be republished to allow families to recognize the disease, for patients to know their own diagnosis, and to seek treatment early for a full recovery. 'Prevention Methods': (1) Gargle with disinfectant mouthwash, and use oil or commercially available Vaseline or teal oil and drop it into the nostrils once every other day to kill germs. (2) Do not go to public gathering places, theaters, and cinemas. (3) Get vaccinated against smallpox. (4) Isolate patients with meningitis. (5) Report any cases of the disease immediately to the Health Department; students should report to the school authorities. The houses occupied by patients and the utensils used should be disinfected. 'Symptoms': Headache, vomiting, chills and fever, stiff occiput, constipation, and occasional delirium, convulsions, etc. Changes in cerebrospinal fluid must be tested for microorganisms. The above-mentioned symptoms may be acute or slow and vary depending on the circumstances. They all start with a cold or sore throat. Although meningitis can be contracted by someone who has already been infected, it can be contracted again. 'Special Treatment': Inject meningitis serum. The earlier the injection, the more certain the cure. The two concession municipal councils and various hospitals have large quantities of serum in stock for public use." In accordance with this, we specially notify the citizens to be fully aware of this notice.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Petition to Extend Long-Distance Telephone Lines in the County <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Construction Bureau is currently preparing to lay long-distance telephone lines from Beiqiao to Maqiao to facilitate transportation. It has already prepared a budget and submitted it to the County Government for forwarding to the Jiangsu Construction Department for approval. As soon as the department's approval is received, construction will begin. However, Yang Fulin, the District Chief of the Third District, submitted a request to the County Government to extend the long-distance telephone lines to Zhuanqiao. County Magistrate Leng instructed the Construction Bureau to investigate and handle the matter. The original request from the district is recorded as follows: "Request for Recording of the Extension of Long-Distance Telephone Lines to Zhuanqiao, for Your Review and Implementation. As approved on March 9th, the Fourth Joint Meeting of the Party and Government in the district proposed that the Construction Bureau has already arranged the first phase of long-distance telephone construction. Should we request that the lines be extended to Zhuanqiao to facilitate communication? Resolved: Submit to the County Magistrate to be handled by the Construction Bureau. Upon investigation, the district originally consisted of the merger of Beiqiao and Zhuanqiao townships. Although the district office is located in Beiqiao, a temporary office is also located in Zhuanqiao. Therefore, the district government's operations especially need to be well-informed. This is the first reason why long-distance telephone lines should be laid to Zhuanqiao. In addition, the Zhuanqiao Security Regiment of the Third District has a police station. Defense matters should also strive for well-informed communications. This is the second reason why long-distance telephone lines should be laid to Zhuanqiao. Furthermore, the Second Branch Bureau of the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau directly governs the three towns of Beiqiao, Zhuanqiao, and Maqiao. Now that the Construction Bureau is planning long-distance telephone lines, the first phase of the project will lay lines from Beiqiao to Maqiao. The branch bureau's communications for Beiqiao will naturally be well-informed, but what about Zhuanqiao? This is the third reason why long-distance telephone lines should be laid to Zhuanqiao. If it is said that due to limited funds, the two cannot be carried out at the same time, the poles of the Shanghai-Minhang Motor Road can be used for Beiqiao to Zhuanqiao, and another line can be hung. The cost is not high, but the benefits are truly significant. In accordance with the aforementioned proposal, it is appropriate to record the resolved case and submit it for your review and approval. Please order the County Construction Bureau to investigate and handle the matter, which would be of great public benefit."</p>

<p>Municipal Government Orders Port Authority to Comply</p>
<p>The siltation of the Wusong River is becoming increasingly serious. If it is not dredged, its impact on commerce and transportation will be significant. It is reported that the Capital Construction Committee believes that the river has a great relationship with Jiangsu Province and the Shanghai Special Municipality. Therefore, it has sent a letter to the two governments and the local Commercial Reorganization Committee, requesting them to send representatives to Beijing on a scheduled date to discuss dredging measures. After receiving the letter, the Municipal Government immediately forwarded it to the Port Authority for compliance and delegated a representative to attend the meeting.</p>

<p>Founding General Meeting to Be Held on April 15th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Factory Association, in order to comply with the Ministry's order to reorganize into the Shanghai Special Municipality Silk Factory Trade Association, held a preparatory reorganization meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. All Shanghai silk factories sent representatives to the meeting, totaling more than 100 people. Wang Xiaolai, a Standing Committee member of the Commercial Reorganization Committee, attended to provide guidance. Shen Huachen was elected as chairman. After the ritual was performed, the chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that on the 15th of this month, the Commercial Reorganization Committee received an order from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to reorganize according to law. A preparatory committee was immediately organized to draft 25 articles of association for the trade association. On March 24th, the articles were passed by the committee. Today, a general meeting is specially convened to ask for public discussion. The chairman then presented the draft articles of association, article by article, for voting. The public believed that Articles 8 and 9 should be merged into one article, for a total of 24 articles, which were unanimously passed. Next, the issue of the abolition of the six silk factory consultation offices in Zhabei, Hongkou, Binbei, Huxi, Tiantong'an, and Hujiamuqiao was discussed. It was resolved that they should be abolished immediately, and all welfare affairs already handled by the offices, such as hospitals and schools, should be handled by the trade association. Then, Committee Member Huang Jinfan proposed that the spring silkworm season in the interior is approaching, and new cocoons will soon be on the market. All the cocoon taxes collected at various checkpoints, such as export taxes for fresh goods, are unusually cumbersome and should be forwarded by the trade association to the government to vigorously request their abolition to reduce the burden. This was passed. Next, Committee Member Zhu Jing'an proposed a date for the founding general meeting of the Shanghai Special Municipality Silk Factory Trade Association. It was resolved that the founding general meeting would be held on April 15th, and the staff would be elected by all members voting. The name Shanghai Silk Factory Association will be abolished immediately. During this transition period, a reorganization committee will be organized, with all executive committee members serving as members to handle association affairs. Finally, Wang Xiaolai, the guiding committee member of the Commercial Reorganization Committee, stated that in the future, all members should attend and participate in the meetings on time to avoid wasting time. All staff members should also carry out their duties diligently and work hard to promote the welfare of the industry. After the discussion, the meeting was adjourned, and it was already 6:30 PM.</p>

<p>Proposal of the Grain Association</p>
<p>The Grain Association, in view of the rising market price of foreign rice and the fact that most transactions each day involve purchases, convened a meeting of the industry in order to maintain the credit of the industry. As the market is constantly changing, it is necessary to maintain business credit. It was agreed that a guarantee deposit of 500 taels must be paid by both the buyer and the seller for every 100 tons of foreign rice transacted, whether for near or distant terms, with similar calculations for larger quantities, in order to have assurance and maintain credit. It will be implemented on April 1st.</p>

<p>From Hujiamuqiao to Hongzhen</p>
<p>Yuan, Director of the Shanghai Special Municipal Public Security Bureau, convened a discussion meeting on the afternoon of the 28th at 10 pm in the building of this bureau with the directors of the fire brigades in Zhabei and representatives of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, in order to rectify fire control affairs in Zhabei. Those present included Yao Xiang-sheng, director of Section 1, Feng Bing-jun, a staff member of Section 2, Liu Rong-tai, director of Section 3, Jin Shi-ru, a staff member of the Zhabei Fire Brigade Federation, and Weng You-san, director of the business department of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant. Zhu, a section chief of the Public Works Bureau, was also in attendance. Yu Qiao, Chairman, announced the purpose of the meeting. Attendees stated that Zhabei district was vast and hydrants were too few. Every time there was a fire it was difficult to put out due to this, so more should be added. Afterwards, Zhu, section chief of the Public Works Bureau, claimed that an investigation of the Zhabei area showed thirty-seven hydrants should be added there, while the fire brigade side claimed that twenty-five should be added in the most important places of each sector. After discussions, it was decided that at 3:00 PM next Tuesday, all representatives would gather at the Zhabei Section 3 Fire Brigade to conduct a factual survey of the area and then decide how many hydrants to add. The installation fee for each hydrant, because it would be set up by the public sector, was set at 50 taels of silver (private installations require 200 taels). The meeting adjourned and it was already 4:30 PM. Also, Zhang Peishen, director of the Hujiamuqiao Fire Brigade, added that because he was ordered by the Municipal Public Security Bureau to install more hydrants to facilitate fire alarms, he immediately sent personnel to conduct a detailed survey in all directions. It was found that thirty-two hydrants should be added from Hujiamuqiao to Yinxianggang Water Temple, Hongzhen, etc. However, the cost is very high. It is now planned to submit a request to the Municipal Government to allocate funds for the installation of ten hydrants, and the rest will be donated and installed by public-spirited businesses in the area. The request has now been submitted to Mayor Zhang for review and implementation.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Accumulation Company's Defense (Continued from Yesterday) <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Before the Board of Directors of the China Merchants Bureau was legally established, the chairman, acting as the Board of Directors (refer to Evidence No. 3, Article 1), should, after registration with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, belong to the future elected Board of Directors. This is based on regular legal principles and is beyond doubt. Even during the transitional period (i.e., from the implementation of the Supervision Regulations to the completion of registration), the defendant only accepted the appointment of the supervisor, and only the supervisor exercised the actual power of appointment. However, the appointee was still the chairman of the China Merchants Bureau, not the defendant personally (refer to Evidence No. 4), which is not comparable to a regular independent appointment. This is also evident. (5) Zhao Tieqiao's Position and Powers: Zhao Tieqiao was appointed by the supervisor and hired by the defendant as the General Manager of the General Administration of the China Merchants Bureau. He should handle affairs under the supervision of the supervisor and be responsible for executing the resolutions of the Board of Directors (refer to Evidence No. 10, Article 11, first paragraph, and Article 13). He should report the handled matters to the supervisors and the Board of Directors for verification at the end of each month (refer to Evidence No. 3, Article 12). The Board of Directors also had the power to appoint assistants to help the General Manager handle affairs (refer to Evidence No. 3, Article 11, second paragraph). The Accumulation Company, together with the Renjihe Insurance Company, was listed in the temporary rules of the China Merchants Bureau as an affiliated business to be handled by the General Administration (refer to Evidence No. 3, Article 14, Item 8, Second Paragraph). According to the same rules, all section chiefs, bureau chiefs, and heads of affiliated institutions were to be nominated by the General Manager and submitted to the supervisor for approval and appointment. However, the General Manager had no power to submit nominations independently or to appoint independently without informing the supervisor. Moreover, because the position of assistant has not yet been realized, section chiefs and bureau chiefs are all exclusively nominated by the General Manager. However, the selection of managers for Renjihe and the Accumulation Company, which are entrusted to the Board of Directors for agency, is still handled directly by the Board of Directors in consultation with the supervisor and has nothing to do with the General Manager of the General Administration (the original files of the Supervision Office's appointment of the two companies can be consulted). Ouyang Rongzhi, the manager of Renjihe Insurance Company, was hired by the defendant and requested the supervisor to add the appointment (can be questioned). After the company was registered and licensed, it convened a shareholders' meeting, elected directors and supervisors, and operated independently, completely separating from the Supervision Office and the China Merchants Bureau. The Accumulation Company is the same, and both are joint-stock companies approved for registration and licensing and ordered to convene a shareholders' meeting to elect directors and supervisors. Its legal status has nothing to do with the China Merchants Bureau Company and has nothing to do with Zhao Tieqiao. As for Zhao Tieqiao's continued mission as a specialist for the reorganization of the China Merchants Bureau, it specifically refers to the China Merchants Bureau Company and does not include the Accumulation Company, as evidenced by the resolution of the Second Plenary Session (the full text of the resolution of the Second Plenary Session is listed as Evidence No. 14), which cannot be misinterpreted. (The Attitude of the Supervision Office of the Ministry of Communications: Supervisor Wang Boqun of the Supervision Office of the Ministry of Communications, who actually appointed the manager of the Accumulation Company, has always maintained a strict and law-abiding attitude towards the Accumulation Company, which has been approved for registration and licensing. As for Zhao Tieqiao, the General Manager of the General Administration, on December 18 of the 18th year, abused his power and ordered the defendant to suspend his duties and appointed the plaintiff to replace him. There was no paperwork or transfer of the Accumulation Company manager, and there was no official document ordering the defendant to hand over to the plaintiff. Moreover, on January 18 of the 19th year, he instructed Lin Shi, an agent of the Postal Bureau, to sign a contract with the defendant in the name of the General Administration of Posts of the Ministry of Communications to lease the Accumulation Company's premises (a copy of the contract is listed as Evidence No. 15). On February 8 of the 19th year, he sent personnel to the Accumulation Company to inspect the accounts and ordered the defendant to instruct the主管人员 to submit the accounts to be inspected at any time (a copy of the instruction is listed as Evidence No. 16). The plaintiff, who was originally the deputy manager of the Accumulation Company, was also appointed by the Supervision Office of the Ministry of Communications, and his position has not changed since he was ordered. (7) The Plaintiff's Position in the Accumulation Company: The plaintiff was the deputy manager of the Accumulation Company and was appointed by the supervisor. After accepting Zhao Tieqiao's appointment on December 18 of the 18th year, he still received the salary of the deputy manager on January 2 of the 19th year. His family is not a shareholder, and the manager of the Accumulation Company he wants to take over was neither elected by the shareholders or directors of the Accumulation Company, nor appointed by the Board of Directors of the China Merchants Bureau, nor appointed by the Supervision Office that had been appointed. Only by relying on the abuse of power of Zhao Tieqiao, the General Manager of the General Administration of the China Merchants Bureau, which has nothing to do with the Accumulation Company, can it not take effect. (8) Conclusion: Based on the aforementioned facts and arguments, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) The Accumulation Industry Co., Ltd., which has been approved for registration and licensing, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. are two completely different matters and are not legally related. (2) The only people who have the right to dispose of the affairs of the Accumulation Company are the shareholders who hold the shares of the Accumulation Company and the agencies or employees they elect or entrust. Zhao Tieqiao is the General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau Company and acts as the specialist for the reorganization of the China Merchants Bureau Company. He has nothing to do with the Accumulation Company and has no right to interfere with the Accumulation Company. (3) The defendant has a historical, legal, and mandatory responsibility for the Accumulation Company that cannot be shirked. (4) The plaintiff, appointed by Zhao Tieqiao, who has no right to interfere, wants to seize the property of the Accumulation Company. The defendant and shareholders who hold shares, who are responsible, certainly cannot accept it. For this reason, I beseech your court to reject the plaintiff's lawsuit and order him to bear the litigation costs. The right to demand that the plaintiff compensate the Accumulation Company for the losses incurred in this lawsuit is temporarily declared reserved. It is for the public convenience. This is a petition to the Shanghai Concession Provisional Court. Petitioner: Li Guojie, Agent: Li Shirui, March 24 of the 19th year,</p>
<h3 id="e189">Judgment in the Deng Zhongze Lawsuit (Continued) <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>(Reasoning) The plaintiff in this case claims that the defendant Deng Zhongze is guilty of fraud, and the only evidence is the establishment of the fictitious China Fuan Company, which is proven by the following five points: (1) The China Fuan Life Insurance Company independently issued its articles of association, which clearly stated that the head office was located in Shanghai. (2) The office of the China Fuan Company was located in the same place as the Shanghai branch of the Hong Kong Fuan Company. (3) Deng Zhongze, the General Supervisor of the Hong Kong Fuan Company, was the General Director of the China Fuan Company. (4) Premium receipts were issued sometimes in the name of China Fuan and sometimes in the name of Hong Kong Fuan. (5) After the Hong Kong Fuan Company announced its liquidation in August of the 17th year of the Republic of China, the China Fuan Company still published a statement in March of the 18th year stating that it would continue to operate. Based on these points, the plaintiff believes that the China Fuan Company is an independent company, but without shareholder capital, it is naturally a fictitious company. However, according to this court, the establishment of the crime of fraud requires that the perpetrator engage in deceptive behavior with the intention of illegally obtaining property, as a constituent element of the crime. Therefore, in this case, to investigate whether Deng Zhongze committed a crime, it should be determined whether the China Fuan Company he established was a kind of deceptive behavior with the intention of illegally obtaining property. Regarding this point, it should first be inquired whether the guarantee of the Hong Kong Fuan Company to the policyholders of the Shanghai China Fuan Company still exists, and whether it is not responsible to the policyholders because it has divided out the life insurance business. If Deng Zhongze uses the establishment of the China Fuan Company as a method of defrauding money, he must make the Hong Kong Fuan Company use the excuse that it has already divided out the life insurance and is not responsible. If the Hong Kong Fuan Company is still responsible, and the China Fuan Company is only in an agency position, as in the case of the Hong Kong Fuan Company, and fulfills the obligations such as compensation in the insurance business according to the articles of association, then no matter whether the China Fuan Company superficially resembles an independent company, Deng Zhongze does not obtain illegal benefits from it, and it is clear that Deng Zhongze has no intention of fraud. Now, it is found that when the Hong Kong Fuan Company was first established, it deposited a guarantee deposit of 22,000 pounds (approximately 250,000 yuan in our national currency) with the Hong Kong government according to its articles of association. Later, when the life insurance business was not developing well, it was transferred to the Shanghai China Fuan for handling. This guarantee deposit still exists. Until the announcement of liquidation in the 17th year of the Republic of China, the Hong Kong Fuan Company tried to retrieve this guarantee deposit from the British government for the purpose of compensating policyholders. It has been stated in detail in the official letter from Luo Zusheng, the liquidator of the Hong Kong Fuan Company, to this court on January 18 of this year, and the accountant Yi Maoli has also testified that after the guarantee deposit was recovered, all the branches and policyholders, including the general policyholders of the China Fuan Company, were treated equally without discrimination. From this point of view, whether the China Fuan Company is a branch of the Hong Kong Fuan Company, the guarantee deposit has not been withdrawn, and it is still willing to bear the responsibility of compensation to the policyholders of the China Fuan Company. It can be seen that the transfer of the life insurance business by the Hong Kong Fuan Company to the Shanghai China Company is purely a matter of factual convenience, so that the old policyholders can continue to pay fees to the Shanghai Fuan Company, and the new policyholders are collected by the Shanghai China Fuan Company. Since there is no impact on the interests of the policyholders, it is difficult for Deng Zhongze to use this to carry out his fraud. Furthermore, it is found that the Shanghai China Fuan Company, after accepting the entrustment of the Hong Kong Fuan Company as an agent to collect premiums one year later, stopped collecting policyholders in December of the 15th year of the Republic of China because the business was not developing well. It can be believed that there are no policyholders from the 16th year or later in the policy submitted by the plaintiff. From the 14th year of the Republic of China to the date of liquidation, the Shanghai China Fuan Company fulfilled the responsibility of returning orders and compensating losses, amounting to more than 200,000 yuan. After the liquidation, more than 6,000 yuan of premiums collected were handed over to the accountant Yi Maoli, which were not denied by the plaintiff. It is even more obvious that Deng Zhongze did not have the intention of illegally obtaining property by establishing the China Fuan Company. Moreover, from the facts that the plaintiff does not dispute, the office of the China Fuan Company and the office of the Hong Kong Fuan Shanghai branch are in the same place, and Deng Zhongze is in charge of both, with the same license, the same staff, and the premium receipts are used by both companies, and the account books are not separated. All of these are sufficient to prove the so-called China Fuan Company is in fact inseparable from the Hong Kong Fuan Company. Since they are factually inseparable, and the general policyholders have not fallen into error because of this and made the delivery of property, the plaintiff's statement that the China Fuan Company is privately established by Deng Zhongze, without shareholders and without capital, is inconsistent with the facts. As for the plaintiff's claim that the Hong Kong Fuan Company was liquidated by the shareholders' meeting in August of the 17th year of the Republic of China, and the Shanghai China Fuan Company still published a statement in January of the 18th year that it was operating as usual, it is naturally a fraudulent act, etc. However, this court finds that the China Fuan Company had already stopped receiving new policyholders at the end of the 15th year of the Republic of China, as mentioned above. Then the so-called business naturally only refers to the unfinished matters such as returning orders and compensating losses. Moreover, since the plaintiffs did not express any erroneous intention because Deng Zhongze published this advertisement, even if this advertisement is erroneous, it does not constitute a deceptive act. As for Deng Zhongze, and the part of the lawsuit against Deng Wenhai, Wu Hanzhou, and Wu Shutang for false accusations, this court finds that Deng Wenhai's lawsuit against Deng Zhongze is purely based on the suspicion that Deng Zhongze established the China Fuan Company to receive the life insurance business of the Hong Kong Fuan Company, and did not fabricate facts. The lawsuit against Deng Zhongze is purely based on the suspicion that Deng Zhongze established the China Fuan Company to receive the life insurance business of the Hong Kong Fuan Company, and did not fabricate facts, and Wu Hanzhou and Wu Shutang's lawsuit based on the policy, regardless of whether the expired payment of the policy is valid, and belongs to the internal problem between the company and the policyholder, should not be considered as a false accusation. Based on the above arguments, it should be ruled that Deng Zhongze, Deng Wenhai, Wu Hanzhou, and Wu Shutang are not guilty in accordance with the latter half of Article 316 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The part of the private prosecution attached to the civil lawsuit is transferred to the civil court of this court for trial in accordance with Article 511 of the same law. The judgment is hereby made as the main text. Gao Junxiang, Judge of the Criminal Court of the Shanghai Concession Provisional Court, pronounced on March 6 of the 19th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3 id="e194">The Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) Cares About Female and Child Laborers <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Female workers in major factories in this port work for about eleven hours a day, so they have no time to pursue the knowledge and entertainment that life should have. The factories also do not have the facilities to improve the lives of the workers. The YWCA, seeing this, has set up a labor department and built branch halls in the areas where major factories are located. There are day and night schools and various organizations to improve the lives of female workers, so that all female workers can enjoy them at will. There are four places that have been established in recent years. The branch hall established for tobacco female workers in the Model Village of Pudong is not only the oldest but also the most developed. Last year, a new labor division was set up near the cotton mill in Xiaoshadu. All the workers in the cotton mill are divided into day and night shifts, which are rotated every week, so the students in the school are sometimes day students and sometimes night students. Although the nearby vagrants often harass the classroom or tease them on the road, the students have never slacked off because of this, which shows the workers' eagerness to learn. In recent years, the YWCA's enthusiastic work has been to cultivate leading talents, and after the female workers have been nurtured, they can also hold meetings, discuss, study, and seek entertainment on their own. In the future, they will surely benefit the industry a lot. The problem of child labor is the most important thing to pay attention to in modern times. Child laborers who work for eleven hours a day in factories not only have no way to study, but also have no opportunity to develop physically. Therefore, the YWCA is now doing its best to create public opinion and engage in reforms. In the future, major cities may be affected by it.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Joint Investigation of Tax Evasion and Bribery <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The owner of the Zhan Huanmo Ink Shop in Shanghai, the other day, entrusted Li Shichun, a greeter at the Ping An Hotel, with 20 packages of black ink and 4 pieces of sundries, disguised as luggage, without declaring or paying taxes, intending to send them to the Zhangjiabang Wharf in Pudong on the Japanese ship Huashan Maru, privately for tax evasion export. When Li hired a boat to cross Pudong at the Company Wharf in the French Concession, he was spotted by Huabao No. 15 of the Water Patrol Room. Li was so guilty that he took out two silver dollars from his bag and gave them to the patrol, hoping to bribe them for release. The patrol became even more angry and took the people, boats, tax-evading goods, and the two bribery silver dollars to the police station. After questioning by the police chief, in addition to confiscating the tax-evading goods to the customs warehouse, Li Shichun was also detained on bribery charges and sent to the local court for investigation today.</p>

<h3 id="e197">The Guo Ju'an Shop False Accusation Case <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Guo Shuopeng, a native of Chaoyang, Guangdong, and his friend co-opened the Ju'an grocery store on Yangxing Street in the French Concession. In February of last year, Zhang Songzhou, a Chinese comprador from the Datong Bank, suddenly sent a notification letter, stating that Tongde Company had ordered goods from abroad and had booked a foreign exchange at the bank, pointing to Guo as the guarantor and asking him to prepare the price for redemption. Guo himself considered that he had not guaranteed Tongde Company and had never met Zhang, so how could he receive this letter? He immediately sent someone to Datong to inquire. Zhang Songzhou showed ten foreign language order forms, with two small wooden stamps of Guo Ju'an on the front and eight on the back. At that time, the back was completely blank. He also asked He Shizhen and He Shimei to go to the inspection again. Xu Maike, the 大班 of the 大　大 通 Bank, showed the aforementioned order forms, the eight with the back completely blank had been typed on the wooden stamps with the typewriter, "If Tongde Company cannot fulfill the payment when the draft expires, we are willing to be responsible for the repayment and pay when the ship arrives in Shanghai." The other two wooden stamps were stamped on the front, and the words "Pay on Delivery" and "Guarantor" were added due to the cramped space between the original text and the seal. Lawyer He knew that it was forged and denied it on behalf of Guo Ju'an. For self-defense, Guo filed a lawsuit with the Provisional Court on May 10 of last year, accusing Zhang Songzhou of forging guarantee documents and requesting an investigation and revocation. When Datong Bank learned that its Chinese comprador had been sued, it filed a counterclaim on the 5th of the same month. Later, the court ruled that Guo was not a shareholder of Tongde, but that Guo was the guarantor of Tongde, and ordered him to pay off the control number on his behalf. Guo refused to accept this, because according to Shanghai customs, a shop guarantee must be in writing and illustrated to be valid. Therefore, he immediately filed an appeal, which has not yet been resolved. As for the case of Guo's lawsuit against Zhang, it will be tried in the Provisional Court soon. The lawsuit is recorded as follows: "For falsely claiming guarantee documents and seeking to implicate, I humbly request revocation. I, the plaintiff, received a letter from Datong Bank on February 15 of the 17th year of the Republic of China, roughly stating that according to its comprador, I had guaranteed the payment of kerosene ordered by Tongde Company in the name of Ju'an, but had not fulfilled the agreement. Zhang Songzhou also sent a letter on October 9 of the same year, insisting that I was indeed the guarantor, etc. However, I, the plaintiff, and Ju'an have never guaranteed anything to the bank. How can the defendant falsely claim the fact of guarantee, causing the bank and related parties to harass me repeatedly, almost to the point where I had to pay immediately? Furthermore, Lin Bangji, Lin Yingjie, Guo Bohan, and Lin Boren of Tongde Company once asked me to witness the English order form printed by the bank when Lin Bangji represented them for ordering goods. At that time, I only stamped my seal on one paper in the position of witness. Now, I heard Zhang Songzhou say that it was the guarantee, which is obviously fabricated in collusion. What doubt is there? Because this matter has not been resolved, the business of Ju'an, which I manage, has been increasingly disturbed. Therefore, I have specially filed a lawsuit, humbly requesting your court to summon the defendants for interrogation, order them to hand over the so-called guarantee, and revoke it to avoid implication. Please bear the litigation costs of this case." (Xinmin News Agency)</p>

<p>The bandit Ge Xingsheng, in the winter month of last year, led a gang to rob clothes, ornaments, cash, etc., from the Zhongyu Inn on Minguo Road in the French Concession and fled. Now, Bao Detective Guo Shaorong and others of the French Police Room have detected it, arrested Ge, and brought him into the police room for custody. He was sent to the French Public Hall for investigation the other day. First, the plaintiff filed a complaint about the robbery, stating that the merchant and the defendant knew each other. There were three people in total that day, one盗　guarded the wind, and two盗 went upstairs to rummage through the boxes. He was robbed of jewelry and other items of great value. Now that he is under arrest, he requests a heavy sentence. When questioned, Ge Xingsheng confessed that he was 25 years old, a native of Pudong, and used to run a麻袋店. Because business was bad, he was inspired by the people to rob. However, at that time, the people only held fake handguns, not real handguns. The rest of his供词 was evasive. The Chinese and Western officials sentenced Ge to five years in the Western Prison. After the term expired, he was permanently expelled from the concession.</p>
<h3 id="e199">News from Various Labor Unions <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>The Labor Unions of Eastern Shanghai and Zhabei issued a declaration yesterday regarding support for the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, stating that, unfortunately, when the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union initially demanded that employers arrange positions for unemployed workers, the employers not only refused but also insisted on being stubborn, disregarding the pain of unemployed workers, leading to public anger. Compelled by circumstances, the workers had no choice but to painfully strike, hoping to prompt employers to realize the situation. Mediation by party and government authorities resulted in a decision that all unemployed workers would be placed by various stores. However, the pharmaceutical workers, in compliance with higher-level orders, unanimously resumed work. Unexpectedly, the employers continued to refuse, preventing unemployed workers from entering stores to work. Such behavior is a disregard for party discipline and the law. The workers' second strike is not what they desire. The Unions consider themselves in the same boat and are heartbroken by what they have witnessed, finding it difficult to remain silent. Even at the cost of sacrifice, they are willing to do anything. In addition to calling on all city workers to deal with the evil employers, they are mobilizing one hundred thousand workers to provide support. They hope that the pharmaceutical workers will continue to maintain their fearless spirit, work hard, and not stop until their goals are achieved. This declaration is made by the Commercial Press Labor Union, Huacheng Tobacco Labor Union, Sanyou Society Labor Union, All Shanghai Silk Factory Workers' Union, Pawnshop Workers' Union, Sino-Foreign Printing Labor Union, Western-style Binding Labor Union, Tiancheng Silk Weaving Labor Union, Xiangchang Silk Weaving Labor Union, Meiwen Silk Weaving Labor Union, Xiangda Silk Weaving Labor Union, Western-style Woodworking Labor Union, Pattern Chair Labor Union, Hongzhang Cotton Mill Labor Union, Hongzhang Dyeing and Weaving Labor Union, Tea Production Labor Union, Renhe Cigar Tobacco Labor Union, and more than thirty other labor unions.</p>
<p>The Tea Workers' Union held its first executive committee meeting the night before last. The meeting was chaired by Hu Zhaotai, head of the organization section, and proceeded with formalities. The following issues were discussed: (1) Cao Gansheng's letter of resignation. Resolved: Approved. Wu Zilin was nominated as his replacement. (2) Deadline for promoting the small group leader nomination. Resolved: Divide into five districts for implementation. The South City is the first district, with Cao Ludao, Hu Xianqin, Ye Zhenda, Wang Haiyang, and Wu Zilin serving as the responsible persons. The French Concession is the second district, with Wu Shenfu, Wu Huaxuan, Feng Lifu, and Hu Zaiyin serving as the responsible persons. The British Concession is the third district, with Wu Rongqing, Hong Guanzheng, Wang Jinggao, and Xu Bingqing serving as the responsible persons. Zhabei is the fourth district, with Jiang Mingdao and Cai Xiaohe serving as the responsible persons. Hongkou is the fifth district, with Hong Weigui and Hu Zhaotai serving as the responsible persons. The deadline for completion is set for two weeks. (3) How to proceed with the investigation of unemployed workers. Resolved: Implement according to the second resolution by dividing into districts. (4) Guangda, Yufengtai, and other companies employing non-members. Resolved: (A) Send a letter of warning to immediately cease the practice. (B) Investigate the introducer, and if they are a member of this Union, they should be punished as a warning. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>The Silk Finishing and Dyeing Workers' Union held its 7th joint executive committee meeting yesterday, with more than sixty people in attendance. The meeting proceeded as usual, and Gu Yongquan was elected as chairman. The resolutions are as follows: (1) Yonghe Factory violated the conditions by hiring inexperienced workers, and representatives should be sent for serious negotiations to stop their work and supplement with unemployed members of the needlework trade. (2) The second registration of unemployed members totaled thirty-one. They are responsible for introducing work within ten days. If they are unable to introduce work by the end of the period, the union will provide travel expenses to temporarily send them back to their hometown to avoid displacement. (3) Unemployed members of Xinda Factory wrote anonymous letters scolding the standing committee members, which is inappropriate. The entire body of unemployed members should be given three days to identify the letter writer, otherwise, introduction for the entire body of unemployed members will be suspended until the truth is found, then work will be reintroduced. (4) Union committee members attending the joint Labor-Management Committee for Reorganizing Dye Prices should be subsidized by the Union for transportation and meals to ensure fairness. (5) There are many unemployed members, and all staff should intensify their work. The secretary is instructed to notify them for compliance. Those who deliberately violate or neglect their duties will be fined or dismissed, depending on the severity. (6) (Omitted).</p>
<p>The Construction Workers' Union of the Special District held its third standing committee meeting yesterday. Chairman Fan Zhong (A) reported on the progress of work in the past week.

<p>Local News 2: An Unexpected Disaster from the Sky: A Madman Kills</p>
<h3 id="e201">Tragic Incident in Xiaonanmen Yesterday: Madman Brandishing a Large Knife Wildly Attacks, Woman Walking on the Street is Killed, Two Children Seriously Injured, One Already Dead <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:35 PM, a madman with a knife killed two people and injured one at the entrance of Tianfu Lane, north of Xiaonanmen, opposite the Qunxue Society on Zhonghua Road in the South City. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>The Madman's Family Background: The madman is named Zhang Jiazhen, 27 years old, from Yaojiaqiao, Zhenjiang. He used to be a tobacco cutter in a water pipe shop in his hometown. He came to Shanghai after losing his job last winter. Zhang has an older brother, Jiayu, who is currently employed at Zhongfa Sock Factory in Jiqingfang, Fangxie Road, as a silk weigher. He also has an older sister, Fan Zhangshi, 37 years old, who is married to Fan Zesheng and lives at 132 Fumin Road, south of Tashui Bridge. Fan is engaged in the telegraph business. The relationship between the siblings is usually normal. After Zhang Jiazhen came to Shanghai, his sister did not take him in because Fan's family was struggling financially and the house was very small. Therefore, Zhang borrowed a shop space from Yao Siqi's Faji Clothing Store at 20 Matianxing Lane, Zhonghua Road, outside the Great East Gate. Zhang has some literacy. After coming to Shanghai, because he had nothing to do, he set up a fortune-telling stall along Zhonghua Road, occasionally peddling puffed rice on various ships to make a meager living.</p>
<p>Brandishing a Large Knife: Yesterday afternoon around 1:00 PM, Zhang Jiazhen was holding a long, rectangular knife used for cutting tobacco (about nine inches long, about one foot two inches long including the wooden handle, about three and a half inches wide, about two catties in weight, extremely sharp) and loitering at the entrance of Tianfu Lane, north of Xiaonanmen. At that time, two women happened to walk by.</p>
<p>Two Women Walking Arm-in-Arm: One was Wu Zhoushi, 28 years old, the wife of Wu Shaotang (also known as Wu Si), residing at 22 Xiaoshiqiao, near the location. Wu is involved in small business and is from Huai'an. Wu's eldest brother, Wu Ganquan, is said to be a messenger in the National Government, and his third brother, Wu Kunquan, is a messenger in the Capital Police Department. Wu Shaotang lives in Shanghai with his mother. The woman is relatively attractive and wears her hair short with a cheongsam, in a fashionable style. She works in a sock factory in Mianjin Lane, Great East Gate. Although the family is poor, they are quite comfortable. The other woman was named Jiu Mei, the daughter of a butcher shop owner outside Xiaonanmen. After lunch at home, the two women were returning to the sock factory to work, walking arm-in-arm and chatting.</p>
<p>Suddenly Kills a Woman: Unexpectedly, Zhang Jiazhen suddenly rushed up and blocked their path. First, he grabbed Jiu Mei, who was terrified and struggled to break free. Zhang then grabbed Wu Zhoushi and violently slashed the back of her head. The woman tried to block with her hands, resulting in her fingers being severed. The woman fell to the ground in extreme pain, and Zhang continued to slash wildly with the knife. As a result, she received two cuts to the back of her head, one to her back, and her head was nearly severed, connected only by a thin layer of skin. Blood spurted out, and she died instantly.</p>
<p>Injures Two More Children: Zhang continued to wave the knife wildly and slashed the back of the head of a 13-year-old child named Leng Caibao, who also collapsed to the ground in extreme pain. He also injured the back of the head and fingers of a 9-year-old child named Hu Hongliang.</p>
<p>Gunfire Fails to Deter: The incident was witnessed by Kang Jiadong, a patrolman from the 28th post, who rushed to apprehend him. Seeing Zhang brandishing a large knife, he fired a shot into the air, fearing danger, intending to make him drop the murder weapon. However, Zhang did not discard the knife. Instead, he raised the knife and rushed forward, attempting to resist and attack.</p>
<p>Shot But Still Runs: The policeman, seeing that the situation was critical and that he would be at a disadvantage if he did not fire, fired a shot in self-defense, hitting Zhang in the left thigh. But Zhang, despite being injured, was still able to run after the policeman. The policeman then fired a second shot, hitting Zhang in the right calf. Zhang was still able to run.</p>
<p>Three Shots to Fall: At this point, the policeman had no choice but to fire a third shot, hitting Zhang in the abdomen, entering from the right side and exiting on the left side. Zhang finally fell to the ground. At that moment, Jin Dianyuan, the director of the 1st District, 3rd Precinct, and Inspector Shi Jiyan, heard the news and arrived with Chief Wang and all the patrolmen, armed and ready. They apprehended Zhang and took him and the murder weapon to the station. They also found another similar large knife in Zhang's left trouser pocket. The knife had a round defect about an inch below the blade, the size of a longan, where the police officer's bullet had hit. This showed the power of his rifle.</p>
<p>Patrolman Hit by Stray Bullet: A stray bullet also injured the left leg of patrolman Li Jieshan from the station. Officer Li was stationed at the entrance of the Port Authority at the location and rushed over upon hearing the alarm, and was hit by a stray bullet. Director Jin immediately sent Li to Shanghai Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Unable to Record Confession: Director Jin instructed that the two injured children be rushed to Nanyang Hospital in Dongwangjia Lane, Xiaonanmen. He then returned to the station to question Zhang, but because his answers were irrelevant, they were unable to record a confession. They ordered Zhang to be sent to Xin Puyu Hall for treatment.</p>
<p>One Injured Child Dies: After Leng Caibao and Hu Hongliang were sent to Nanyang Hospital, Leng Caibao died in the hospital before treatment could be administered. Leng Caibao was 13 years old, from Zhenjiang, and lived at 44 Meijia Lane in the city. He was a student at Cangji Primary School near the scene. His father, Leng Zixiang, had died three years ago and was an investigator for the Firefighting Union. The child's mother and two brothers arrived at the hospital upon hearing the news and mourned over his body. They said that because it was Sunday, the school was closed, so he and his classmates planned to go to the popular cinema to watch a movie, but they didn't know how this tragedy occurred. Autopsy of the Deceased At around 2:00 PM, Lu Yongde, the head of the 16th precinct, summoned by Director Jin, was ordered to report to the local court and request an autopsy. Subsequently, Prosecutor Yang and inspectors arrived at the scene and determined that Wu Zhoushi had died from knife wounds. They issued an order for the body to be collected. The judge then went to Nanyang Hospital and determined that Leng Caibao had also died from knife wounds to vital areas. He ordered the family to collect the body and agreed to the mother's request to seek justice for the deceased. The judge agreed.</p>
<p>Fingers Severed: They then inspected the injured child, Hu Hongliang, before returning to the hospital for further review. The injured child, Hu Hongliang, is 9 years old and from Anhui. He lives at 1 Lanyin Lane, west of the Great South Gate on Zhonghua Road. Both parents are deceased and he has three older brothers and three older sisters. He attends Meixi School. Yesterday was a Sunday holiday. After lunch, he originally intended to go to the popular cinema with his 11-year-old brother, Hu Hongchang, but because Hongliang ate a little late, Hongchang went to the cinema first, and Hongliang followed behind to the location, where he suffered this tragedy. It was determined that the injured areas of Hu Hongliang included his right thumb bone being broken, and his little finger and ring finger being cut off at the joint. The middle of his left hand was cut with a knife, so the bones of his little finger, ring finger, and middle finger were all cut off. The back of his head was slightly cut. According to the doctor, the injury is serious and a decision must be made in a week. Even if he recovers, he will likely suffer permanent disability.</p>
<p>Summoning Persons Involved: Director Jin ordered Yao Siqi, Zhang Jiazhen's sublessee, Zhang's sister, Fan Zhangshi, and Zhang's brother-in-law, Fan Zesheng, to come to the station for questioning. According to Yao Siqi, 43 years old, from Zhenjiang, who runs Faji Clothing Store at 20 Matianxing Lane, he said that last winter, a cousin of his, who used to work as a clerk in a water pipe shop, was friends with Zhang, so his cousin introduced Zhang to temporarily stay at his place, but he didn't charge rent. He doesn't know how he caused this disaster today. Please investigate. Fan Zhangshi, 37 years old, said that Zhang Jiazhen is her younger brother and has a history of mental illness, sometimes it flares up and sometimes it gets better. However, he hadn't flared up since coming to Shanghai last year. Please investigate. Fan Zesheng's statement was the same as above. Director Jin ordered them to be released on bail pending further instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Taiwanese Prostitute Falls to Her Death at Sea <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>An Inevitable Marriage in an Island Country</p>
<p>Separated for a Year, Letters and Telegrams Fly</p>
<p>Man's Infidelity, Loving Someone Else</p>
<p>Returned for a Few Days, A Tragic Incident Occurs</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 2:00 AM, a Taiwanese woman named Lin Abao fell to her death from the streetside balcony on the fifth floor of a certain hotel on Racecourse Road, Sixth Avenue, due to a romantic dispute with her lover, Zhang Liangqing. The situation was quite bizarre and the scene was very tragic. The details are explored below.</p>
<p>Meeting Late in an Island Country: A Taiwanese woman named Lin Abao, currently 23 years old, comes from a distinguished family. When she was over ten years old, due to poverty, she followed a neighbor to Dongying, residing in Osaka. Later, due to poor circumstances, she became a prostitute, unable to uplift herself. Helpless, entering the brothel, without a benefactor to meet, she was depressed all day, lamenting her misfortune. Last year, a man named Zhang Liangqing, from Ningbo, was doing business in a Japanese thermos factory. Zhang, pursuing his career in a foreign land, had few confidants. Therefore, he frequented brothels and met Abao. They met in a foreign country and hit it off immediately, regretting that they hadn't met sooner.</p>
<p>Lovebirds Fly Separately: After Lin Abao met Zhang Liangqing, they fell deeply in love and made a lifelong commitment. Their relationship was very close for several years. Later, Abao, due to family matters, left Zhang and went to Taiwan. Zhang also had no intention of doing business in a foreign land and returned to his home country. Unexpectedly, the lovebirds were separated, and Lin returned to Japan after several months at home, but she didn't find any trace of her lover. She was very surprised, thinking that Zhang might miss her and would travel to Taiwan, so she packed up and returned to her hometown again, but there was no sign of him.</p>
<p>Bringing Personal Belongings to Shanghai: After Zhang Liangqing returned to his home country, he settled in Nan Shi, Jiumu. Thinking of his lover Lin Abao, he couldn't help but feel the vicissitudes of life. Therefore, letters and telegrams flew frequently, inquiring about her in Japan. After Lin received Zhang's letter, she was happy that her lover had settled down. "There's no place to find when you break your iron shoes, but it takes no effort to bring them back." She immediately packed up her savings of over a thousand dollars and came to Shanghai, bringing three pieces of luggage: a leather bag, bedding, and a rattan basket.</p>
<p>Reunited in a Hotel: After Lin arrived in Shanghai on the 25th, she stayed in room 527 on the fifth floor of a hotel on Racecourse Road, Sixth Avenue. When she arrived, she was dressed gorgeously, behaved elegantly, wore her hair in a Western style, wore a short cheongsam, and wore high-heeled leather shoes. She looked like a noblewoman. After opening the room, she held a piece of paper and instructed the waiter to call a Zhang from a certain place in Jiumu. At this moment, the so-called Zhang Liangqing, also dressed fashionably, walked in with his head held high. Reunited after a long separation, they were even more delighted.</p>
<p>Love Suddenly Breaks Down: After Lin and Zhang opened the room, their love was extraordinarily strong. The waiters often saw them holding hands and walking away, and returning side by side. Their attitude was very calm. On the 27th, because they thought the room was too small, they moved to room 536. Unexpectedly, after moving the room, their love suddenly broke down. There were often arguments in the room. The servants thought they were like a couple, so they didn't pay attention. However, hearing through the window, the argument was all about money. Little did they know that in three days, an unbearable event would occur.</p>
<p>Barefoot Jumps from Building in Dark Night: Because Zhang Liangqing often had unfeeling actions, Lin Abao regretted that she shouldn't have come from afar, and wanted to promise herself for life. Because Zhang had a former wife at home, he didn't dare to commit bigamy and completely refused her request, claiming that in Japan, he spent a thousand dollars on Abao, and this time she brought money to Shanghai to repay it. At 10 PM the night before, they closed the door and went to bed without any action. Unexpectedly, at 2:10 AM yesterday morning, Lin Abao, for some unknown reason, only wore a single layer of clothing and went barefoot to the balcony and jumped off in anger. Such a tragedy occurred in the dark night.</p>
<p>Beauty's Life Expires: Lin fell from the balcony on the fifth floor, which was six zhang high. How could her fair skin endure such a heavy blow? The balcony of room 536 faced Yunnan Road. At this time, it was quiet, and a desolate scene suddenly appeared on the road. After Lin Abao fell from the building, her nose was half gone, her whole body was crushed, her intestines and lungs were broken, and the blood and flesh were blurred. It was unbearable to watch. The car sent to Renji Hospital for treatment was delayed until 10 AM yesterday morning, when she died.</p>
<p>Police Investigation of the Truth: After the Lao Zha Police Department received a report from the hotel's employee, they believed that the case was bizarre and had great research value. They immediately instructed detectives to rush to room 536 on the fifth floor of the hotel. Inside, they saw Zhang Liangqing in the middle of a good dream. They pushed him awake, but he didn't know what to say. The police believed that he was highly suspicious and might have committed murder for money, so they detained him in the police station. He will be sent to court this morning for trial. It is said that Zhang Liangqing has already fallen for someone else in Shanghai. There is a Ningbo prostitute in the Champagne Hotel who also has a very unusual relationship with Zhang and has made a marriage agreement. Zhang also broke his promise. The prostitute was so angry that she swallowed smoke, but she didn't die, which was also a recent event.</p>

<p>Wife and Daughter Are Forcibly Occupied by Neighbors</p>
<p>Entering the House to Inquire, He Was Chased Out</p>
<p>Forced to Seek Legal Remedies</p>
<p>Cao Longsheng, who lives at 706 Gordon Road, and his wife, Ms. Chen, have been married for 16 years and have three children. Last year, Cao worked in the Housheng Cotton Mill and only returned home once or twice a month. A neighbor, Zhao Quanlin, often came to Cao's house to seduce his wife. Soon after, he had a relationship with Ms. Chen. Zhao then took it a step further, abducting Ms. Chen and her two daughters, as well as taking away all the furniture. When Cao returned, he realized that his family was gone. He learned later that Zhao had abducted them. When he negotiated with him, Zhao promised to give Cao a large sum of money and keep Ms. Chen and her daughters for himself. Cao was unwilling to accept these terms, but he was distressed that he didn't know where his wife and daughters were being held. It wasn't until noon on February 23rd of this year, when Cao was walking past 20 Sanyuli, Cishi Road, in the French Concession, that he inadvertently looked up and saw his wife, Ms. Chen, hanging clothes on the upstairs balcony. He immediately entered the house and grabbed her, intending to send her to the police station. However, the second landlord of the house, Jin, snatched Ms. Chen away, claiming that she was Zhao's wife and chased Cao out. Cao couldn't reason with him. Later, he learned that his eldest daughter had been forced into a brothel as a prostitute. Therefore, he hired a lawyer a few days ago to file a complaint with the Provisional Court against Zhao Quanlin for abduction and theft, requesting punishment and demanding the recovery of his embezzled savings of seven or eight thousand dollars. The court has approved the complaint and summoned him to court for trial.</p>

<p>Wang Bizhen from Hubei runs Xiangji Cigarette Paper Shop, an affiliate of Ping'an Hotel at 15 Zhubao Road in the French Concession, and also manages Hubei province exchange matters. His shop was coveted by bandits. Yesterday morning at about 10:00 AM, the shop sent senior clerk Bian Yushan from Zhenjiang, carrying $2,200 in banknotes and over $400 in cash, intending to send it to Yikang Money Exchange on nearby Catholic Church Street. Just as he left the shop, about to board the shop's private car, number 2603, six bandits suddenly emerged from the roadside. Some wielded Mauser pistols and others held handguns, ordering Bian to be silent. They robbed all the banknotes, but did not take any of the cash because it was too heavy. After the bandits obtained the loot, they dispersed to the north and south to escape. Two robbers carrying the loot fled toward the Common Concession via Avenue Edward VII. The remaining robbers fled south. When they reached Avenue Dubail, they saw a Vietnamese police officer, so the robbers fired two shots into the sky as a warning before fleeing without a trace. Afterwards, the victim reported the situation to the police station, requesting apprehension.</p>

<p>The Japanese coal merchant ship Sumaura Maru entered Shanghai the day before yesterday and was unloading cargo between buoys 10 and 11 at the Balianjing Customs. It hired a rowboat owned by the brothers Wang Erxiao and Wang Sanxiao from Jiangbei, which was used to ferry crew members to and from the shore. At about 1:00 PM, the rowboat was alongside the right side of the Sumaura. Four Japanese crew members wanted to take the rowboat to Puxi. Two Japanese peddlers also wanted to borrow a ride ashore. Wang Erxiao loudly refused, saying that the rowboat was not allowed to carry unauthorized passengers. The two peddlers were dissatisfied and boarded the boat, untying the rope. At that time, the tide was rising rapidly, and the Erxiao brothers were unprepared. The boat was unable to maintain its course and drifted south, colliding with the bow of a coal ship. The rowboat was impacted and immediately capsized. The six Japanese and the two Wang brothers all fell into the river. Except for five Japanese and Wang Sanxiao, who were rescued by a salvage boat, a Japanese (a crew member of the coal ship) named Takajo, and Wang Erxiao both sank to the bottom of the river. The Japanese man was about 37 or 38 years old, wearing a black Western suit, with a yellow broadcloth coat over it, and black leather shoes. Yuasa Masakazu, an official from the Japanese consulate, has reported the incident to the water patrol police. Wang Erxiao, 20 years old, from Jiangbei, was also reported to the water patrol police by his younger brother, Sanxiao, that night for the purpose of recovering his body.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special City Public Security Bureau issued an order to the district offices yesterday, stating that the survey tables of street, lane, and alley names submitted by the district chiefs have been compiled and printed after collection and classification, in addition to being distributed. However, because road names may have changed or been omitted, the printed road name register, along with blank pages, is being sent to two offices. The district chiefs are ordered to carefully compare, adding the house numbers under the street, lane, and alley names within their jurisdiction, from which number to which number, or if there are any road names that have been omitted or changed, add and change them on the original register according to the writing style. In addition to each district keeping a copy for future reference, the other copy should be checked, filled out, and submitted to Shanghai within half a month of receiving the order, so that it can be recompiled and made accurate. There should be no delays.</p>

<p>Li Chenghua and Wang Shuxiu, patrol officers of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Water Patrol Team, along with patrol leader Wu Minshen and others, patrolled the Huangpu River on a motorboat yesterday morning around 1:00 AM. They observed two foreigners on a ship belonging to the French company Datuo Ning (transliteration) near the China Merchants Bureau's Zhongzhan pier. The foreigners appeared flustered upon seeing the police and quickly prepared to disembark. Suspecting their behavior, the officers moved to inspect them. Unexpectedly, the foreigners began throwing coal chunks from the ship to prevent the police from approaching. The officers bravely pressed forward and detained one foreigner named Sisko (transliteration). They discovered eleven Browning handguns and seven hundred rounds of ammunition on his person. They then apprehended another foreigner. At that moment, the foreigners on the ship, relying on their foreign status, attempted to forcibly retrieve the detained foreigner. However, the detained foreigner seized the opportunity to remove his overcoat and escape. The officers could do nothing but take the first detained foreigner, Sisko, along with the guns and ammunition, back to their station. After preliminary questioning by Director Xu, it was determined that, given the recent occurrences of foreigners illegally trafficking firearms in the Huangpu River, exploiting the fact that foreign ships are not subject to inspection by Chinese police, the police's inspection was met with disrespect and violence by the foreigners, which was extremely illegal. Director Xu ordered a formal document to be prepared and the foreigner, along with the seized guns and ammunition, to be transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Third Division for further investigation.</p>

<p>Around 7:00 PM last night, in front of the Chang'e Dance Hall on Tianzhutang Street in the French Concession, a pedestrian named Song Derong, 34 years old and a local resident, was passing by when he encountered a foreign sailor, identified as Sailor A, who was staggering in the road due to excessive drinking. The sailor became enraged and drew a bayonet, stabbing Song in the left waist, causing a wound about an inch deep. Zhou Fugen, a barber from the Overseas Chinese Barber Shop (located on the upper level of the Chang'e Dance Hall), witnessed the incident and intervened, also being stabbed in the left hand by the sailor. Two Chinese constables, numbers 392 and 496, arrived at the scene and transported the two injured individuals to Renji Hospital for treatment. The sailor was detained at the police station for investigation.</p>

<p>Lawyer Fees Cause Dispute - Awaiting Scheduled Judgment</p>
<p>The Japanese merchant ship Atsuta Maru previously collided with and sank the Chinese merchant ship New Da Ming. After years of negotiations, an arbitration committee consisting of representatives from China, Britain, the United States, and Japan was formed last year to conduct a fair arbitration. The committee ruled that the Japanese side should compensate the Datong Shipping Company, the owner of the New Da Ming, 165,000 yuan. One of the lawyers hired by the New Da Ming, an American lawyer named Roger, subsequently demanded a fee equivalent to one-quarter of the compensation from Yang Zaitian, the manager of the Datong Company, amounting to 47,500 yuan. Yang was only willing to pay 40,000 yuan, which Roger refused. In April of last year, Roger filed a lawsuit in the Provisional Court. Yang hired lawyers such as Zhan Jifeng to argue that the original contract stipulated a fee of one-fifth of the compensation. They further argued that the plaintiff, Roger, had taken advantage of a critical moment in the case to coerce a new contract with a fee of one-fifth plus five percent, which was legally invalid. Moreover, the arbitration ruling could not be enforced until the defendant intervened to facilitate the process, which resulted in the favorable judgment. Witness Shen Zhigong could attest to this. Roger argued that handling the case was not easy, involving dozens of appearances and the submission of seven legal documents. He claimed that the requested fee was not excessive and that the defendant would likely not have received any compensation without his efforts. Judge Guo ordered the debate to conclude and scheduled a date for the verdict. Later, lawyer Zhan and others requested that Shen Zhigong, a key witness to the mediation, had not appeared and requested a summons.</p>
<p>The court granted their request and reopened the debate on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, still presided over by Judge Guo, who informed both parties that he had received a letter from witness Shen Zhigong detailing the mediation process. Upon hearing this, the lawyers for both parties commenced a new round of debate. The court then announced that it would schedule a date for the verdict.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Hongchang Hardware Store Sues for Losses Due to Relocation <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Seeking Compensation of 16,000 Yuan - Extensive Evidence of Various Losses</p>
<p>The owner of properties in the Nan Fuxing Li and Bei Fuxing Li areas in Zhejiang Province, Xi Ehua, leased the properties to Huang Chu Jiu for a period of twenty years. Huang Chu Jiu then notified all tenants to relocate by a certain date to facilitate demolition and reconstruction. The tenants filed a lawsuit, and the Provisional Court ordered the landlord not to demolish the old houses before the lawsuit was resolved. However, Xi Ehua defied the order and forcibly demolished the houses in early September of last year. The court issued a warrant for Xi's arrest for contempt of court. Subsequently, the Merchants' Groups Consolidation Committee members Wang Yansong, Wang Xiaolai, Wu Zhihao, and others intervened to mediate the situation. As a result, the landlord compensated the tenants for relocation losses totaling over 60,000 yuan. The thirty-eight tenants then requested and were granted the withdrawal of the lawsuit, allowing the reconstruction to proceed as planned. Now, the houses in the area have been rebuilt and completed. However, Hongchang Hardware Store, one of the former tenants, claims that it did not receive any of the compensation and has suffered significant losses due to the relocation. Recently, it hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Xi Ehua in the Provisional Court, seeking damages. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, Judge Luo Chongtai opened the court to hear the case. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the amount of each loss: (1) Damage to goods due to demolition, subsequently sold at a low price, resulting in a loss of 9,095.8 yuan; (2) Loss of renovation costs of 2,000 yuan; (3) Comparing business volume in the ninety-two months after relocation to the business volume in the seven or eight months before relocation, reduced sales of over 11,000 yuan, resulting in a loss of 2,216 yuan based on interest at two percent; (4) Loss of 1,000 yuan for moving goods and business equipment; (5) Loss of 2,000 yuan for rental dig fees and lost rent from the new shop. The total of the above five losses is over 16,300 yuan. After voluntarily waiving a small amount, the plaintiff requests compensation of 16,000 yuan. The plaintiff also stated that documents such as renovation invoices have been lost due to the passage of time. Also, the dig fees never had receipts. Therefore, the plaintiff has no documentary evidence for such losses, but can prove the other losses. They also stated that dig fees were paid when they originally leased the property from the defendant, but are not seeking to recover that amount at this time. The defendant, Xi Ehua, hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to appear in court and argue that the property was completely leased to Huang Chu Jiu for a period of twenty years, starting from August 1 of last year. Since that date, Huang has managed the property and been responsible for all actions. The plaintiff was well aware of this, and Clause 1 of the lease agreement between Xi and Huang stipulates that Huang is responsible for compensating former tenants for relocation costs. Therefore, the compensation of over 60,000 yuan given to the tenants through the Merchants' Groups Consolidation Committee was actually paid by Huang Chu Jiu. However, Xi acted as a liaison to give the money to Merchants' Groups Consolidation Committee members Wang Yansong and others to pass on to Feng, Qian, and Mo, the representatives of the tenants' association. The plaintiff, being one of the tenants, can only negotiate loss issues with the three representatives they elected. Judge Luo then stated that, in law, if the tenants authorized the compromise representatives, the plaintiff is bound by their actions. Otherwise, different considerations apply. Lawyer Jiang continued, based on the interpretation of the compromise agreement, it applies to all tenants. The court should summon Wang Yansong and others to the court to inquire about the compromise situation for clarification. The plaintiff's lawyer replied, stating that the plaintiff did not participate in the compromise and did not authorize Feng and others to represent or sign on behalf of the plaintiff. Judge Luo then adjourned the case for further investigation.</p>

<p>Situ Shaowu (also known as Situ Hua), a Cantonese worker at Watson's Soda Factory, repeatedly sent threatening letters to the factory manager, Guo Weiyi, demanding 5,000 yuan. Guo reported the case, and the worker was arrested and detained in the Provisional Court for investigation. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, Judge Zhou conducted the trial. The police lawyer presented the defendant's confession from the police station. Guo also testified that the defendant had repeatedly sent letters and that he had witnessed the defendant signing the confession at the police station. When questioned, the defendant admitted to writing the threatening letters and that the statements in the confession were his own free admissions. After the trial, Judge Zhou sentenced Situ Shaowu to five years of imprisonment, and the seized knife and threatening letters were confiscated.</p>

<p>Zhu Shengjing, a carpenter, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the French Court, stating that a Russian man named Li Haike had hired the plaintiff to make all the equipment for a wine bar. After completion, the defendant gave the plaintiff a check, but when the check was presented for payment, it bounced. Despite repeated demands, the defendant ignored them. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit, stating that the defendant's actions constituted fraud and requesting an investigation and the recovery of the debt. The defendant, also represented by a lawyer, argued that he had funds in a certain bank and that he had no intention of defrauding the plaintiff, requesting that the case be dismissed. The judge adjourned the case for further investigation.</p>

<p>Good-For-Nothings Take the Money, Villagers Get Nothing</p>
<p>The Yongxing Real Estate Company, formed by Texaco, recently purchased over two hundred acres of sandy land in Laoshu Sha to build oil tanks for storing gasoline and kerosene. However, this sandy land was formerly owned by a certain military and political official in Shanghai, and the current sale price of over four hundred yuan caused objections from the original local villagers. Yongxing Company learned of this and, fearing complications, hosted a banquet. Afterwards, they distributed 60 yuan or 40 or 50 yuan to each person, nominally as "drinking fees." However, these fees were taken by loafers and idlers, while the villagers received nothing. When the sand residents learned of this, they became agitated and mobilized about two hundred people, who waited at the pier every day for the Yongxing Company manager to arrive on the sand to demand the money. Yesterday, they also crowded into the warehouse to inquire about the truth of the matter. At that time, their momentum was tumultuous and unreasonable.

<p>Public Bus No. 102 of Route 3, operated by the Public Bus Company of the Public Concession (license number 15102), was traveling from Caojiadu to Beixinjing in western Shanghai around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The driver, No. 257, was speeding eastward on Bailinan Road near the Yipin Brick Factory in Zhoujiaqiao when he inadvertently collided with a cyclist in front. The cyclist fell forward, causing a head injury and bleeding profusely. The cyclist lost consciousness. A nearby police officer saw the incident and immediately helped the injured person into the bus. Patrol Officer Wei from the local sub-station arrived at the scene to investigate. Because the injured person was seriously injured, the patrol officer transported the injured person along with the bus to the Sixth District. Unexpectedly, as the bus was traveling along Zhongshan Road in Fanhuangdu Qiaotou, it encountered scaffolding being erected for bridge construction. A rope was tied across the road. The driver did not see the rope and drove straight through it, dragging the rope and causing the large wooden scaffolding to collapse, hitting a pedestrian named Tang Youming, causing a head injury and body injuries. Several panes of glass on the bus were also shattered. Patrol Officer Wei ordered the police to help the injured Tang Youming into the bus and transport both injured people to the Sixth District Police Station. The District Chief then dispatched police to transport the two injured people to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road for treatment, pending further investigation.

<h3 id="e220">Woman Sues Husband for Abuse and Abandonment <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>A woman named Hou from Suzhou married Yu Mingxiang as a concubine at the age of twenty-one. In the winter of the 14th year of the Republic (1925), her husband fell ill and, knowing that he would not recover, gave her 3,000 yuan. He died shortly after. Hou deposited the money in the Fan Tongyu Bean and Rice Shop, owned by her sister, Fan Hou, to earn interest. In the winter of the following year, Madame Chen Si'a acted as a matchmaker and persuaded Hou to remarry to Wu Zhirong, a local man, as his third concubine. Wu owned shops such as Ding Shunxin Soy Sauce Shop and Tong Fuyong Wine Shop. His home was located at No. 1849 Jinjiazhai, Zhengjiabang, Aiwenyi Road, and he was considered to be well-off. Wu is now fifty-seven years old, while Hou is thirty-three. Hou recently hired lawyer Ni Qiong to sue Wu in the Provisional Court for abandonment and other charges. According to her statement, Wu Zhirong and his second concubine, Li, were both addicted to opium and forced her to serve as an opium-smoking attendant, which she did day and night without rest. Later, after learning that she had 3,000 yuan in cash deposited with her sister, Wu forced her to withdraw the money and combine it with 2,000 yuan from the sale of jewelry, and deposit it all in Ding Shunxin Soy Sauce Shop, in exchange for giving her the Tong Fuyong Wine Shop. Towards the end of last year, when she went to collect the profits from the wine shop and the interest on the deposit, she incurred Wu's wrath. From then on, he arbitrarily picked quarrels, first verbally abusing her and then physically assaulting her. She fell ill with worry, but Wu not only refused to provide medical care but also forced her to continue serving as an opium-smoking attendant while ill. Forced to sell her clothes for medical expenses, she temporarily returned to her mother's home and hired a lawyer to negotiate with Wu, but Wu made no concrete offers. His actions constitute abandonment, a criminal offense, and should be punished by law and ordered to return the deposit, she stated. The court subpoenaed Wu on the day before yesterday, but the defendant did not appear. The judge ordered a warrant to be issued for his arrest and further hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e228">The Sorrow of Youth <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Duo</p>
<p>When this feeling came to my mind, I felt extremely sad, as if stabbed by a knife in my heart. Although my circumstances are not very fortunate, they are not uncomfortable either. During the day, I laughed heartily, forgetting myself. However, at night, my mood would become depressed. The silence of the night led me to the land of fantasy. "Youth is about to leave you. In these few years, have you felt satisfied with the past? Have you done anything to enrich your life? You must know that the past is the foundation for future development. You must patiently grasp it, and perhaps the uncertainty of the future can be reduced by a fraction." I have thought about this blankly many times, but what is the result of thinking like this? Besides an emotional feeling at that time, what else is there? I cannot answer.</p>
<p>I do not blame Heaven, nor do I resent others. Indeed, the wounds that life has given me are not more than those of many others. Moreover, there have been several times when it has considerately comforted me. Logically, I should be immersed in the valley of joy, singing the glories of youth. However, I cannot. I insist on seeking trouble for myself, insist on plunging into the deep valley of sorrow. The reason is that I am by nature fond of deep thought and long-term consideration. The result of thinking is that there is less joy and more sorrow. According to experienced people, if such thinking can be tempered by dreams, then one can let one's mind wander and feel unparalleled joy, because thinking is too painful, and dreams reduce the monotony of life. However, is this possible? When you glimpse the blackness before your eyes and the uncertainty of the future, you are already preoccupied with worries, how can you have the mood to dream? Alas, the pity of modern life, and even more pitiable is the early years of youth, when there is not even time for dreams.</p>
<p>So now, I only feel the sorrow before my eyes and worry about the reefs that I foresee in the future.</p>
<p>It's strange, even to myself, that I don't know when I started staying up until after twelve o'clock every night, and I inevitably suffer from insomnia every night. When I wake up startled from a deep sleep, listening quietly to the silence of the night all around, and the one or two miserable cries coming from the factories, the calls of those selling snacks, it makes me feel even more lonely, even more immersed in deep sorrow. Alas, although youth is worth cherishing, it is also enough to make one feel sad and sorrowful. "A life of permanent satisfaction is truly unattainable." So that's how it is.</p>
<p>In my dark mood, there is also a force that binds me, and that is homesickness. Originally, a person, for the sake of pursuing a future or other pursuits, does not hesitate to leave their hometown and go to a strange place to live as a guest. During this period, if one is well-fed and clothed and has days of joy and glory, one will not usually have any sorrow. But if one encounters any unsatisfactory realities, or if one has a somewhat pessimistic outlook,</p>
<p>then one cannot help but feel sorry for oneself. When one lies awake at night, looking up at the clouds and the moon in the sky, how can one not shed tears sadly, immersed in the valley of nostalgia? Ah, this Nostalgia has such great magic. My current mood, in addition to the sorrow of youth, has drifted into homesickness.</p>
<p>Clearly, as long as the sound of the zither pierces my ears, I think of everything in my hometown. I shed tears for the parents' hardship. I grieve for my sister's death, and even more for... everything. I cannot bear to say it. In short, I am now surrounded by sorrow.</p>
<p>Alas, the mysterious night is gone, and it is again the realistic day. The dazzling sunlight is gone, and it is again the mysterious night. Cycling like this, I don't know when I can jump out of the sorrow before my eyes. Now, the warm spring breeze has begun to blow, and the continuous spring rain will also fall. It's just a pity that I am still there in sorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e229">New Trends in the Organization of Academic Groups on Campus <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>When it comes to academic groups, their organization should naturally consider how to facilitate academic research in every aspect. Their work should focus on practical academic exploration. We feel that academic pursuits are endless, while life is finite. Even if a person dedicates their entire life to studying a field, it is practically insufficient. Therefore, it is necessary to unite like-minded comrades to form an academic group for collaborative research and mutual reporting, aiming to achieve greater results in a shorter period. This led to the initiation and widespread adoption of academic group organizations. The prototypes of such organizations are more prevalent in universities and specialized schools. Whenever we step into a school, among the numerous announcements, we can always find at least one or two notices for academic groups such as political science societies, economics societies, education research associations, and XX literary societies—a variety too numerous to list. Indeed, it is bustling.</p>
<p>However, because it is too bustling, it has been noticed by some ambitious individuals and students who want to show off. They believe that if they become officers of these groups, they can naturally look down on everything and fulfill their desire for the limelight. Some ambitious individuals and students with colored backgrounds understand that academic groups can evoke students' sympathy, so they casually join to achieve their goals, tricking pure students into their traps. As a result, the pure name and organization of academic groups have gradually become chaotic, transforming into a stage for exhibitionism in the eyes of everyone. Some are even called literary societies, but upon closer inspection, they are disguised factions of small groups.</p>
<p>Our school, Datong University, cannot escape this exception in the organization of academic groups. As far as I know, certain literary societies with considerable history are often disguised factions of certain individuals. Recently established literary societies are often transformations of certain hometown associations. Other academic societies are controlled and monopolized by certain factions. Furthermore, I am aware of an interesting fact: someone was unable to achieve their opportunity to show off because they were not elected as an officer of a certain academic society. They were so embarrassed and angry that they wanted to withdraw from the society. In short, the organizations of all academic groups have almost become strongholds for various parties and factions, objects for those seeking the limelight. In each re-election, they all do their best to erect their respective flags and compete fiercely. In fact, since things are as they are, the superficial purpose of academic exploration has long been cast to the four winds. The academic institutions outwardly are full of the atmosphere of academic groups, but those who are in them feel lost. To put it bluntly, it is no less than political parties within a country. Fortunately, there is a recent and somewhat satisfactory trend. The responsible personnel of our school and a relatively clear-headed group of students have understood the content and drawbacks of the existing academic groups on campus, and they also know the intentions of those who preside over the existing academic groups. Therefore, they feel that in order to truly achieve some practical academic research, they must first abolish the formal organization and shatter the dreams of ambitious individuals. All committees and chairpersons are abolished, so there is naturally no limelight for them to show off and no opportunities for them to exploit. This new trend of organization is being implemented in Xia Zhong by the Sociology Society and the Economics Society. They have absolutely no officer elections, and the responsible persons are assigned in turns. The method of convening is mutual responsibility, informing each other verbally. In this meeting, they jointly decide the date and location of the next meeting, and they also decide the research topics and those responsible for reporting. Although the implementation of these two groups has not been long, it is not possible to report any of their achievements, but at least one point can be proudly claimed: the members of the organization are generally rejecting those who join with the idea of showing off, as well as those ambitious individuals who want to exploit the group to achieve their goals and fulfill their purposes. Whether this method is perfect and whether it can achieve satisfactory results naturally remains to be seen in the future. In short, this is a new trend, a new trend that is worth noting, worth cultivating, and worth reporting as a reference for the organization of academic groups.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Jiaotong University Tightens Curfew for Female Dormitories <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>By Z Yan</p>
<p>It has been three years since Jiaotong University opened its female dormitories. Although the boundaries between male and female students cannot be said to be completely broken, male and female students are often seen together on the grass field in the setting sun, either playing tennis or volleyball. When the lights are lit at night, male students and female students often sit on both sides of the long table in the female dormitory's reception room, either studying or chatting and laughing. These two examples prove that they are not completely segregated.</p>
<p>In the past, only male students came to the female dormitory to find their friends, and no female students went to the male dormitory to find their boyfriends. Moreover, he could go to the female dormitory at any time before the lights were turned off at eleven o'clock, without any interference from the dormitory supervisor. Now, the Office of Student Affairs has stipulated that male students are not allowed to go to the female dormitory after 8:00 p.m. because the reception room in the female dormitory is too small, there are too many people studying, and the noise makes it impossible to concentrate on studying. If one is already there before 8:00 p.m., then as soon as the clock strikes eight, the female dormitory supervisor runs to the reception room and shoots them with an expelling gaze, running back and forth several times. Although they are unwilling to leave, they have no choice but to leave under her terrible gaze.</p>

<h3 id="e239">Hugo and Clemenceau <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>In 1870, Hugo returned to Paris from the Isle of Jersey in a very disheveled state. Although he had spent some years in exile on the island, it only increased the sympathy of his admirers. Therefore, when he arrived in Paris, the welcoming scene was almost the same as welcoming Napoleon.</p>
<p>After he moved into the Weili Hotel, many people came to visit him. There was a small town near Paris, and the mayor of that town was one of those who visited him. He was a young man of about thirty years old. His cheekbones were so high that people were almost afraid of them. He had already grown a small mustache above his lips. After Hugo talked to him for a few words, he immediately went up and embraced this mayor whom he had met for the first time, and then calmly asked another friend, "What is the mayor's surname?"</p>
<p>"George Clemenceau," his friend replied.</p>
<p>This fact is excerpted from the Hugo biography written by Remon Sheguo Nan. He also carefully recorded the month and day when Hugo and Clemenceau met, saying that it happened on the evening of September 5, 1870. At that time, Clemenceau had avoided going to New York because of political differences, but at the same time, he was thinking of a seat in the Senate for Hugo. Because after that embrace, the friendship between the two of them became even stronger.</p>
<p>Hugo was a pioneer of French Romanticism. His friends, such as the novelist Merimee (1803-1870), the poet Musset (1810-1857), the poet Lamartine (1760-1869), and the novelist Gautier (1811-1872), all raised the banner of Romanticism together. His position in French literature, according to Remon Sheguo Nan, who wrote his biography, is comparable to Dante, Shakespeare, and Goethe. His biography describes Hugo's private life in great detail. He said that Hugo's youth was very similar to Marius in his famous novel Les Miserables. He also said how Hugo and his friend Saint-Bouve, a famous French literary critic (1804-1869), became estranged, because Saint-Bouve fell in love with Hugo's wife, and Hugo, who was never very angry, greatly broke up with Saint-Bouve because of the fire of love.

<h3 id="e240">Who is the Author of Odyssey? <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>The ancient poem Odyssey has already been a household name. A few years ago, Columbia University President Butler advocated that this poem was written by a woman, and many people regarded it as heresy at the time. However, recently, B. Farrington, a lecturer in ancient books at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, published a book called Butler and the Odyssey, which is the first time he has agreed with this view and has presented new evidence.

<h3 id="e241">King George's Favorite Writer <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>The British current King George V's favorite writers in his youth were Jules Verne and Captain Marryat. He remembered most of their works completely. In 1909, when he was still the Crown Prince, he returned to England from Canada on the warship Indomitanle. A certain captain thought this was a rare opportunity and wanted to set a new record. To help him achieve this, the Crown Prince brought a few attendants to work as stokers. One day, while he was chiseling coal and adding fire, his clothes slipped to his waist. He said to someone beside him, "This reminds me of hineas Fogg wanting to travel around the world in eight days." None of the people in the coal bunker recognized that this was from Jules Verne's ideal novel, except for one stoker, because he had a good memory, and the future emperor rewarded him with a gold pound. He still likes adventure novels now, and he rarely cites other novels.</p>
