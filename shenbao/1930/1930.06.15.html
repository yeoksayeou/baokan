<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本之不景氣</h3>
<p>日人用語常有所謂不景氣者蓋即不穩定之意也日本各閣員以今日因經濟界空前之不景氣而致影響於政界之不景氣於是多主張將緊縮政策轉換於積極發展方面以挽救此不景氣而濱口則謂若捨棄緊縮政策將使商業更加衰落而愈陷於不景氣因之欲挽救不景氣方策遂趨於極端相反之兩途矣</p>
<p>竊謂世界事變之來襲必有其原此次日本經濟界之不景氣當然以受世界不景氣侵襲之影響爲多而此次世界不景氣之原因則又與歐戰後之不景氣大異歐戰後之世界經濟可謂不景氣之極然而其原僅由於一時之戰亂暫時脫離正常軌道故經各國盡力整理猛烈發展工商業不數年果收積極政策之效經濟頓然復歸於穩定然而因積極發展之結果又種生産與貿易發展不均衡之病根夫生産與消費同樣增進方能維持穩定之局若一方工廠之生産激增一方巿塲之購買力銳减則當然因生産過剩而發生變動今日經濟界之不穩定即食此發展不均衡之影響如仍欲以救濟歐戰後不穩定之積極方法救濟今日不穩定之潮流恐其結果非徒無益而有害若捨振興工業政策而别有所謂積極之途徑則吾人實未發見之也</p>
<p>夫世界之經濟斷無常在此不穩定之中或則漸上正常軌道回復以前穩定之狀態或則離去正常軌道愈遠竟由不穩定而墮入於混亂不可收拾之境則全視各國政府中操大權有大力者之如何應付是誠今日之大問題也</p>

<h3>中華籃球隊失敗之研究</h3>
<p>（許民輝）</p>
<p>全隊弱點和盤托出</p>
<p>日菲戰法詳細討論</p>
<p>丨願我中華隊員及練習籃球者細讀之丨</p>
<p>出席第九屆遠東運動會之中華籃球隊以南開五虎爲根本彼等早已名旋全國曾一度擊敗菲島名隊再加以北平三傑上梅天津之陸姚國人莫不以爲此次遠東錦標必有把握豈料初敗于日再敗於菲四戰四比眞是一敗塗地誠出吾人之所料亦開我籃球隊自有遠東運動會以來無限恥辱了其所以失敗之原因雖甚複雜兹就鄙見所及者貢獻于熟心籃球諸君亦所以望于各隊員領袖有則改之無則加勉之意也兹特分别論之</p>
<p>（甲）前鋒</p>
<p>中鋒劉建常善跳其跳球時常得球惟屢次將球拍向一處爲敵人察覺故球亦往往落于敵人之手劉本一員猛將惜其球術有意到與不到之分有時可以出神入化有時則躉無精采連戰四仗均未見其一顯神通其弊在跳球後即退居保守地位其進取遲慢有時得指導員或隊員之興奮劑則其球術頗有可觀然不久即又依然如故</p>
<p>右鋒唐寶堃活潑敏捷人所共許惟慣球至籃底然後投射日菲深知此人之技早已派員監視故無術可施同隊者亦爲他人看守乃不得已而用遠射法惟其平日對于遠射甚少練習故多不命中指導員及隊員莫不以其爲奸出風頭因而怨責而唐則以爲在此種情形之下旣無傳球之可能而敵隊又堅守城池除遠射外實無别法故各執一是聯絡工去因而大差故隊員精神亦因之不可唐雖不能免于批評然實則訓練方法不良有以至之也唐之對於體育精神平素甚奸惟在我國第二次與日比寶時曾二三次不顧球而用隂謀傷人此雖因日評判屢次無故罰球有以激憤之然未始于其人格上有美中不足之憾也</p>
<p>左鋒姚恩漢長于籃底提射惟此次日人監視森嚴不能稍近而其身體甚短又自知其遠射不　故得分之機會甚少往往將球向後傳亦出於不得已也</p>
<p>左鋒魏蓬雲原是候補員各次比賽加入甚少第二次與日本再賽時憤評判之不公球出界時得球後竟向檢察員面部擲去第一次爲其避去不旋踵第一次則乘其不備再擲之中其腔部檢察員欲與之理論停觀者以足踢之回頭時不知是誰所爲幸將完塲否則恐不免發生糾紛評判員之不公無人不憤若以隊員而有如此舉動大失其代表吾堂堂中國人格</p>
<h3>（乙）後衛</h3>
<p>我隊後衛注重保守距籃下十五尺以内之地惟菲日投射大多數在二十尺至三十尺之間而我隊所用五人聯防法前鋒三人約在中線上菲日前鋒一破我第一防線即施行遠射且其命中者不少故我後衛不能不出而奪之於是籃下空虚敵人有隙可乘故亦不行後衛進退維谷陣勢大亂雖有李國琛劉冠軍亦莫能禦及易以陸鐘恩則善於種鋒屢有建樹惟聯絡工夫欠惟數人　攻大這往往回救不及故得不償失中菲第一次戰本有極好機會分數常不相上下及至最後數分鐘時我後衛兩次侵人犯規球均入籃且被罰二次亦均命中共失八分否則我隊早已獲勝矣</p>
<h3>（丙）全隊</h3>
<p>以全隊而論五人聯防工夫尚須改良並宜練習純熟其第一度防線宜退後數尺第二度防線宜進前一二尺使敵人雖攻破第一防線亦不至陷於危險地位且敵隊第三人濳人第一防線時前鋒必須有一人隨後監視之第四人濳人時第二前鋒監視之及其五人進攻則第五人亦需監視之庶可無虞若第三四人旣穿過第一防線而仍死守前方則敵衆我寡未有不敗者以遠東四戰而論我隊左右二前鋒均無近籃投射之機會故第一二三次之戰唐姚二將並無成績可紀其第四次唐寶堃所以能擲中九球者大多　皆由於遠射之功故遠射練習不可輕看倘遇敵人閉關自守之時亦不得不一用也我隊第二次與日本再戰上半時我隊以二十一與十一之比大敗下半時乃改換陣線全用候補員與之比賽而分數反續漸增加其最接近時不過相差兩球卒又將正隊完全換入終以二十一比三十七敗於日此更足以證明其正隊進攻之不得法也唐姚二人善於短傳及籃下投射迨至進無可進傳亦四顧無人可傳然後遠射在此轉瞬間敵人早已回防或爲人奪去或爲人所　故不能人籃副隊則未受嚴格訓練聯絡工夫大不如正隊然其乘機遠射則較正隊速而準此雖個人表演爲多然以日隊陣法論其弱點正如我故用遠攻法頗得手若以球藝論副隊實不如正隊然在第二次與日比賽時副隊所用方法可謂適中肯要而正隊則以中將劉建常之進退遲速爲標準賴劉進速則得分之機會多劉進遲則得分之機會少若劉退守則幾無得分之希望惟此君往逗留於後方吾隊焉得不敗哉</p>
<p>又觀吾隊四戰結果</p>
<p>（中丨日）</p>
<p>第一次二十四丨三十九</p>
<p>第二次二十一丨三十七</p>
<p>（中丨菲）</p>
<p>第一次二十四丨三十九</p>
<p>第二次四十三丨四十八</p>
<p>則知日人注重防守其後衛二人不輕出戰吾隊所得分數不過二十四與二十一而已菲隊則不然其進攻也或以四人或以五人故其内部稍空吾　之短　及　底投射法機會　多故其成續亦較奸乃有三十四與四十三分最後一次幾敗菲隊此可見吾隊人材不弱惜知已而不知彼得一種方法則自滿自足以露操必勝之劵不願再加詳細研究置敵隊於不　所謂滿招損者誠可爲吾籃球隊鑑也噫往者已矣來者可追五人聯防陣法破之者尚有　身短傳法等深願吾籃球隊諸君若仍用此法防守則以須撤底研究使敵人無隙可　而我之進攻法亦必力求精到使敵雖有鐵壁銅墻亦莫能　夫如是不特可以雄據東亞即歐美列强亦不難稱　是所厚望者焉</p>

<h3>一個犧牲於游泳之大學生</h3>
<p>履冰</p>
<p>南京金陵大學學生夏進平爲該校農科學生不久即可卒業夏君爲體育健將於上星期前約同學三人往通濟門外河中練習游泳迨縱身入水不數分鐘間即遭滅頂一時聞者莫不惋惜余居停粤人與夏君爲同鄕言之頗詳兹擇報紙所未載者述之亦體育界之哀音也</p>
<p>夏君幼年在粤即喜游泳迨入大學以我國運動瞠乎人後深以爲恥精研愈力平居節衣縮食以購體育書籍其未死前一日尚持海外寄來之游泳專書力讀不釋前年夏季夏君赴香港曾一度在輪埠上失足落水以諳水性得不死今竟死於首都意者此中殆有數歟</p>
<p>通濟門外之河並不深廣而羅君以久練之身奮體一躍即沉而不起迨援者拽之上岸腹部並未鼓脹内中亦無吞水醫生斷爲氣閉謂爲不救若然則熟習游泳者固不可不加以注意斯亦體育界應研究之一問題也</p>
<p>君軀幹堅實體力亦强曾於某次語其同鄕謂願以畢生精力從事游泳俾他日可於國際連動塲上佔一席地否則雖死亦不瞑目其言甚壯而今竟死君之目殆未瞑也因誌此以爲之悼</p>

<h3>紫蘭女士個展時的感相陳抱一</h3>
<p>看人家的畫時我總覺得欣悅一在觀畫的興味一在研究之點尤其是看到愉快的畫便會興奮起來這當然也不僅我如此恐怕凡愛作畫看畫的人大都會有如此感</p>
<p>然一面也想到看畫對於畫的理解及愛好固然也因人而異便在作家方面也有對於與自已的畫風趣味思想不同的畫往往不純樸地感受或便指爲非的情形尚且難免何况不是作家的觀賞家呢但世間原是非常複雜這種情形却是自然尤其在我們的没有怎樣長久歷史而且常受困迫致發育不良的洋畫界這種情形更屬自然</p>
<p>我們的洋畫界從全體看向來總似乎在混沌裏面但到最近也幸賴諸同志的努力我們的洋畫界竟也漸顯眉目了一方面到外國留學研究美術的人也漸多了一方面能學悟只依照自已的感覺去追求而只求從自已的内部發揮的人也漸見有了這兩方面情形雖略似不同然而在我們的廣大的藝術界都却是必要的而且爲着我們全體的進展都是可感爲欣幸的</p>
<p>再想到我們藝術園即全體藝術界的情形不論現在日漸生發的萌芽多少不論藝術思潮也漸見何等複雜起來我覺得在藝術研究發展的立塲看則對於藝術萌芽的發生成長却是有心於藝術的人們所熱望着的吧如果這藝術園裏將見有很好的萌芽發生出來不但在這大地期望享受「藝術的花」的人們應將怎樣去愛護培植才好呵便在同是萌芽的我們作家自已也爲着園裏的繁榮應將感到怎樣的欣悅呵總之我覺得美飾我們大地的「藝術的花」的不絶的成長開放却是有益於我們人類生活的事情所以我熱望着我們的藝術園裏將見有各種的健實的萌芽盡各自的發生力去成長</p>
<p>關紫蘭女士的藝術也是我們所知道乃由其健實的萌芽發生過來的</p>
<p>對於好的藝術的成長我在好幾年前已有常見的機會我見得好一直在好自已的成長中自然地成長過來的現在也是成長着今後成長到如何地步則非我現在可能預量</p>
<p>我當見好的畫那明郎的爽快的傳彩那簡朴的率直的手法都感到是由一種異常的力量發出的好的作品能給與我們深印象的我覺得不僅是由於好的單純的自由的直覺的處理所表出的純全的表現在這以上我們還可感得有好的美妙的音韻的振動我覺得在看了好的畫之後仍然反響着在心裏的却就是這種美音的除韻我覺得這些在好的藝術的發展裏都是何等可寶貴的素質</p>
<p>我又覺得好向來在好許多同伴或先進中也未嘗不見到各種畫風然這裏在不好的意味說好些亳不受到誘惑而只在好自已的觀感裏悠然地成長着這確可見得好自已的表現意識何等深强却比之從外界的感染還更是她自發的原力來得大</p>
<p>從這次展覽會的許多作品上我們可見好向藝術追求的進境踏來的種種徵跡同時也没有不能從這些作品上感到有其發展着的濳力</p>
<p>我覺得現在這些作品决不是限止其成長的性質的對於好今後藝術的進展却是們我同道者所欣悅地期望着的女士的作品除了前數年曾在上海出過數次展覽會及日本方面也曾出品過以外這次好的個展在上海方面却是第一回</p>
<p>原來展覽會之舉行在作家方面看來是很麻煩的事尤其於現在我們的藝術界裏却有種種不方便但想到我國現在的情形而從美術與社會相接之點想來則展覽會却是很直接而有益的工具對於女士只欲在這時期發表好一些作品請同志們評覽並給大多數人觀賞的意義我們同志數人都認爲美舉而極表贊意的</p>
<h3>法蘭西新畫壇華賓</h3>
<p>在現代巴黎最有銳氣的成爲中堅的主要的繪畫運動大别之有野獸主義立體主義搆成派寫實主義新寫實主義自然主義等</p>
<p>野獸主義（Ｅauvisme）這運動占着現畫壇的重要的地位其代表作家如馬諦斯（Ｍatisse）勞爾（Ｒaoul）特郎（Deran）等</p>
<p>馬諦斯是最具有野獸主義的精神的從一九○二年以來就作了很好的作品在一九一○年前後出來的西班牙的「舞女」「金魚」「靜物」以及黑色基調的三姊妹圖及一九一九年的「白羽毛帽子的婦人像」等最爲傑出其後漸漸一反昔日的赤裸裸的感激而趨向於精練的手法他在最近巴黎的畫商中是最流行的大家的一人</p>
<p>勞爾「Ｒoarl」不是像焉諦斯那樣一般的但是他那表現的强和深在畫壇上是最重要的作家</p>
<p>特郎他的野獸派活動中的作品有很多的傑作以後受了野獸主義的洗禮他所獨得的古典主義的作品同爲現畫代所重視他是現代流行兒的一人</p>
<p>立體主義（Ｆauvism）這種勢力現在還是很盛在許多作家的思想根底上可以看得出來辟卡蘇和勃拉克是這派的創始者而且是最可以代表的作家</p>
<p>辟卡蘇（Ｐicasso）他的才氣縱横一時無出其右他的不覊的天才使他作出種種不同的作品如辟卡蘇夫人像是新古典主義的極作最近他的作品又可以看出入於新寫實主義的範圍了但結局他是被人視爲立體主義的最代表的作家和勃拉克同是占着重要的位置</p>
<p>構成派（Ｃonstructionion）羅托（Ｌeoult）是目下這一派最代表的作家　　寫實主義（Ｒealism）凡拉芒克（Ｖlamink）是這派現代最代表的作家</p>
<p>凡拉芒克最初和特郎一同加入野獸的運動目下爲寫實主義的第一人表示那强烈的作風經過柯爾培Ｃoubel的寫實主義到了他便留意到物質的描寫初期野獸活動中的作品頗似俗訶（Ｇogh）的氣魄和動調到歐洲大戰之後便漸漸以物體實在觀念爲主很多學塞尚（Ｌizanne）的地方其後他的色彩成爲黑白的二大分别般的生出他獨得的力强的寫實但最近他的作品已稍稍的顯出色彩的了</p>
<p>自然主義（Ｎaturalism）這個名稱放在此處稍爲有點不適當的樣子但便宜上把幽德里羅和弗利愛兹歸在這裏</p>
<p>幽德里羅（Ｕtlico）他是一種街景詩人的畫家在他那素直的氣魄和力强的描寫上是很有價值的最近他的作品色調變爲明快但没有像舊作的那樣有素直的魁力了</p>
<p>弗利愛兹（Ｆriesz）他被列於寫實主義的作　是有相當的根據如舊作的「老詩人」「弗利愛兹夫人」及一九二五年的秋沙龍所出品的「二裸婦」等都是十分可以看出他的寫實的力量的但其後所作的許多風景畫單只是近於自然主義的寫生圖最近許多畫商都在運動抬高他的價值</p>
<p>新寫實主義原這一派和野獸主義表現主義或者所謂未來主義相接近是一種自由混淆的西葛爾（Ｃhagal）是這一派代表的作家</p>
<p>雪葛爾他受着立體主義的洗禮漸漸趨向於情緒的純藝術陶醉的成爲新寫實實主義和野獸主義的中間的表現法色調及感覺極爲新鮮在巴黎畫壇上是一個特殊的畫家</p>
<p>又同一作家同時畫着種種的畫派如僻迦蘇是一個最可注意的人物</p>
<p>又如Ｄufy是着重裝飾的效果的作家在現畫壇上也是值得注意的他曾一度受野獸主義的洗禮他那近代的藝術才能的豐富和官能的敏捷使繪畫上有極强力的新鮮的趣味是有特色的作家的一人</p>
<p>此外畫家如蒲那爾（Ｂonnard）他追隨印像派系統系統的色調他那繪畫陶醉的氣分和官能的敏捷在巴黎畫壇上佔有重要的位置</p>
<p>司龔若克（Ｓegonzac）他自從在一九二二年的秋河龍出品二點繪着在樹下兩對男女的大作以來便有了相當的聲譽目下已占了現畫壇的重位他的深沈和重的力量使他的作品極有價值這樣的傾向繼續了許多年直到最近色調漸漸變爲明快表示出法蘭西人的精練的氣風</p>
<p>這些作家之外還有一羣依着秋沙龍和獨立沙龍而活動着的青年作家中的優秀分子把巴黎書壇弄得非常熱閙這種青年作家的眞實和熱烈的心在將來實在是很有希望的</p>

<h3>音樂底敎育者可華</h3>
<p>聽王瑞嫻音樂館試奏後</p>
<p>音樂的偉大底價值是古今中外的學者共通地承認的莎士比亞說「無音樂即無以爲民族」魯斯金說「音樂是最直接最有秩序最完全的身心的快慰也是能給各時代人同樣的帮助的僅有的一個」爲什麽各時代學者對於音樂這樣的看重呢拿一句話來說因爲音樂有左右民族性的偉大底力量</p>
<p>在中國却視爲「末技小道」有的呢雖然因爲西洋文化的輸入從而學習音樂然而多數的目的祇是閒時的消遣或是說得激烈一些小姐們以會演奏拿來作滿足虚榮的工具（但並不是一概而論因爲否則就不能有下文）其餘的人呢都承認所謂音樂却是「無用之學」</p>
<p>雖然近年來國中音樂的園地已經漸漸的滋長了拿事實來證明國人自已的演奏會也多了在最近也有了差强人意的專門爲了音樂而設立的國立學校了這個功勞我們該感謝我所提及的第二類人中的幾位少數的例外者因爲這些例外者的事業是值得我們肅然起敬的在這裏我將特别提出的是董王瑞嫻女士王瑞嫻女士從美國回來後即從事於她的偉大的事業丨音樂底敎育令我們所感佩的以美國檢定音樂敎師的資格曾在各學校及國立音樂院當過音樂敎授現在除了自已設立了王瑞嫻音樂館外仍在曁南等校任敎因爲好是獻身於音樂底敎育的我不必作詳細的介紹因爲從好所培植的人才上我們可以理會她的一切這是顯而易見的</p>
<p>當我聽了好們第一次鋼琴演奏會的試奏以後更發現了王女士的事業的偉大因爲好不祇從事於音樂的普通敎育而更注重於音樂的兒童敎育演奏會的第一部份全數被兒童佔去了從六歲起到十一歲的兒童一個個都是天眞而活潑潑地而她們的天才却更值得讚嘆那兒童節奏樂隊的演奏的齊整便我更想起訓練的不容易然而我們那位循循善誘底獻身者絶没有疲倦因爲好是感到十分興趣的她喜歡兒童</p>
<p>她深信兒童是將來的主人翁她深信從音樂可以使兒童走進美麗的世界表現他特殊的個性嗜到創造的樂味擴大他的同情發展他的智念撫慰並提清他的精神並且增加他身心的美德</p>
<p>在這裏我不能完全提及讓我們看幾個特出的人才吧因爲就是這幾個已經夠人咋舌的了</p>
<p>李素心（七歲）好祗是起始學琴然而好那純熟的演奏已能表現她十足的天才這句話你們必得相信因爲到現在她還祇學了兩個足月的琴咧</p>
<p>王佩玉（七歲）我喜歡好演奏時那活潑天眞的姿態好像眞的置身於好所奏的「第一個華而資」裏面了全演奏會從頭到底我覺得好的姿態　是最可人意的因此更相信音樂那個偉大的力</p>
<p>董光光（六歲）光光是瑞嫻女士的女公子祇這一句話已是不言可喻了她祗六歲的年紀而已經彈Ｓonatina（模範小曲）這當然是從母親那裏襲得的先天的作用你祇要按鋼琴上的某一黑鍵她從聲音上就可以告訴你這是Ｃ高半音或是Ｂ低半音了</p>
<p>吳樂懿（十一歲）樂懿在兒童中算是最大的一個所以她的演奏也是　好然而拿她的年齡來平均的和成人比較他是十足可以當神童之名而無愧的因爲她已經彈成人的樂曲了她奏韋伯的「波蘭大舞」我不知道她那小小的十個指頭有什麽魔法她是十足的一個Ｖirtuoso（精於演奏者）然而我希望他及早學習理論因爲我們眞的希冀一個東方的女性莫扎爾德</p>
<p>在第二部份的成人演奏我不能詳細地說總之都是肯吃苦的音樂愛好者徐維明夫人說是祗學了半年琴已有這樣的成績其餘劉慧嫻馬虚若李玉華包可珍諸女士的演奏都是固有的才能加着勤懇的練習的結果這些無處不表現她們的敎師的功能</p>
<p>最後安置着作爲殿軍的董悅麗女士我不能不特别提起她那「」Ａ低半音大調山歌」眞是感動了人她的手指所落的地方所發的旋律和和弦的每一個活動都是表現着十足的情感的她雖然因爲不尚虚榮的緣故不爲人所知道然而她的技術却是夠和祇以誇耀爲事的小姐們較量的她的可貴之點因爲她不是所謂「千金」而是個職業的婦女在業餘的少量底暇時還拼命的習音樂希奇得很她們之間多數是從事於敎育事業的人同時又都醉心於音樂眞是有其師必有其生了</p>
<p>她們的演奏會於六月十四日（星期六）晚八時三刻在光陸大戲院後面的天安堂俱樂部舉行到那時聽衆的掌聲將驚動蘇州河邊的行人是毫無疑義的</p>

<h3>大夏劇團底公演靜</h3>
<p>這兩年來戲劇運動的空氣可謂澎漲到極點了而學校的戲劇運動更有個特殊的進展我們大夏大學處在這種緊張的空氣中一些對於戲劇有興趣的同學自然也不免捲入這個高潮而校中雖没有特設戲劇系專聘戲劇敎授來指導和提倡但是經一部分愛好戲劇的同學們數年來的努力在整個的戲劇運動中竟然也占了相當的地位在社會上也得了相當的聲譽</p>
<p>談到大夏劇團凡是愛好戲劇關心大夏劇團的人們總能記得去年大夏劇團公演底「子見南子」吧大夏劇團從公演了子見南子」後它就得了許多的聲譽社會上愛好戲劇的人們也就認識了該團的精神表示了無限的希望</p>
<p>努力的結果又在本月十一日假座大夏禮堂公演了是晚搬上舞臺的有三個劇本即「到明天」「月亮上升」「賊」都是獨幕劇它的劇惰恕不介紹吧我祇感到他們的思想底急進似乎也在追趕著所謂「時髦」吧</p>
<p>我固然不懂得什麽是學校戲劇運動的意義也不曉得學校戲劇運動對於劇本選擇的應有的認識但我至少是感覺得在現代中國的學校裏似乎還用不着暗示階級鬥爭吧當前的危機似乎不是社會的不均而是氏族意識的消沈吧現在中華民族正是要求自强時代我們要爲整個民族的前途而奮門這是時代的需要大概不能否認的吧</p>
<p>我們覺悟了一般青年民族意識的缺乏意志的萎靡我們不是隨處可以看到一般青年受外來思想的麻醉忘記了自已是中華民族的一份子做人家的工具而不自覺嗎又不是隨處可以看到世紀病的青年所在皆是他們祇知呻吟得到小小底不幸就挫志退却一味底消沉下去嗎因之我們學校的戲劇運動應該對症下藥應該抓住這點癓結來做我們學校戲劇運動的目標肩起亭個應盡的使命來喚起青年認識自已的民族底應該愛護來喚起青年底勇往直前的志氣認識人生光明的大道</p>
<p>其次卜來談到這次舞臺上的事實看了這次大夏劇團的公演使我們得到的也祗是失望和慨嘆除了「到明天」一劇是摩登社諸人的扮演外其餘的兩劇在表演的時候祇聽到台下觀衆嘘嘘呵呵的聲浪這大概都是表示他們的贊美吧第二劇「月亮上升」的一幕内這個「人」的演來扭腰歪頭油腔百出顯然很像舊劇中的丑角但究其劇情而告訴我們的說是一個革命的領導者大概他們所謂革命領導者的態度是這樣的吧此次在佈置方面的潦草對白的模糊而且連劇詞的也未純熟碰到了台下嘘嘘和喝彩之聲又弄得心慌意亂在「賊」的一幕中竟然把劇中的情節和劇詞都忘記了許多這實在使觀衆們太滿意了質之大夏劇團諸君以爲何如</p>
<h3>只怕不努力</h3>
<p>曁大設暑期田徑賽訓練班</p>
<p>這次遠東運動會我國失敗以後大家都知道了中國人是飯桶是不能和人家比的一比馬上出醜就相形見絀了難怪從前外人說我國人都是病夫幸而現在已高了一等變作飯桶了丨在遠東大會中我華人吃飯本領最大别國都趕不上我們丨眞是羞恥慚愧和丢臉自經過這次的惹大的剌激以後只要永久地不忘努力加油總有一天是比人家好</p>
<p>中國的青年是很有剌激性的也很有好勝性的我相信將來一定有突飛猛進出類拔萃的人才和成績</p>
<p>現在曁大的同學們鑒於已往的失敗所以在暑假裏有暑期田徑賽訓練班的設立請吳邦偉先生指導把暑期的二月時問來努力訓練「不怕熱不怕死只要努力」這是他們的目的</p>
<p>倘若每個公私大學個個都能這樣這次失敗的恥辱馬上就可恢復同時也可得到旁的許多好處只要我們摩登青年都有「努力」兩字在心頭（安）</p>

<h3>Discussing Party Affairs Issues</h3>
<p>Drafting a Declaration for the Enlarged Meeting</p>
<p>Zou and Xie Issue a Formal Declaration</p>
<p>Beijing: At 11:00 PM last night, Chen Gongbo, Chuan Rulin, and Zhao Pilian arrived in Tianjin to meet with Guo Taiqi, Hu Zongduo, Tan Zhen, and others, hoping to issue the declaration for the enlarged meeting. As Zou and Xie already agreed with Yan's advisor on a monthly salary of 500, and Wang Faqin and Bai Yunti advocated that Wang preside over party affairs after his arrival, they did not go to Tianjin. Chuan Rulin will go from Tianjin to Pingyin to meet Yan and report. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beijing: Zhao Pilian will depart for Liaoning from Tianjin within the next few days. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beijing: News from the Party indicates that the War Zone Affairs Committee in Hong Kong will move to Tianjin when Wang leaves Hong Kong. Originally, the committee had dozens of members, with Wang as the chairman and Chen Gongbo and others as members. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beijing: Fu Rulin went to northern Shandong to meet Yan and requested him to sign a reply telegram to Wang. After the meeting at Hu Zongduo's residence in Tianjin last night, a draft general declaration for the enlarged meeting was prepared. Chen Gongbo, Tan Zhen, and Mao Zuquan all signed it. Zou and Xie telegraphed Wang, questioning him, so they agreed to consider it slightly. Someone advised Xie and Zou that their names could be listed in the general declaration and that in the future, there would be room for them to prevent the leftists from manipulating party and government matters. They were urged not to take the topic too seriously. Feng Yuxiang, Lu Zhonglin, and Xue Dubi telegraphed, entrusting a representative to sign for them. Zhao Daiwen and Shang Zhen entrusted Zhao Pilian to sign. It is planned to establish the enlarged meeting in July, at which time the personnel for the political meeting will be selected. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beijing: Today, Xie and Zou formally declared that although Zhao Pilian and Fu Rulin had recently consulted on party matters, they only mentioned issuing a declaration and did not involve Wang's eastern telegram. They also did not submit any drafts for review. Regarding Wang's eastern telegram regarding the establishment of the enlarged meeting with the second Guangdong session as the main body, they already considered it inappropriate and sent a questioning telegram. If Wang Jingwei and Chen Gongbo do not create further complications, the declaration can be issued without any problems. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Zhao Pilian arrived in Tianjin on the evening of the 13th. Chen Gongbo arrived in Tianjin at noon on the 14th and consulted with Hu Zongduo and others again on party affairs issues. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Surrounding Jin Army in Pingyin</h3>

The rebel commander Zhang Huizhao led a crowd of twelve regiments, attempting to launch a night attack on Pingyin, but was met head-on by my Wan brigade and retreated in disarray. Our army's Division Commander Sun Tongxuan had already gone to the front to oversee the troops. Based on the enemy's situation, it is clear that they have no ability to attack again. Jiyuan is as peaceful as usual. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beijing Yishibao: Last night's telegram from Jinan stated that fighting in Qihe has ceased for two days, and there has been no sound of artillery in Luokou for three days. It is rumored that the Jin army, due to foreign relations, has been ordered to cease its advance. It was previously reported that Tang Shengzhi left Tianjin for Shanghai on a Japanese warship to go to Hunan, but no agreement has been reached. Tang is still in the Japanese concession in Tianjin, awaiting Wang's instructions on where to go. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beijing: Zhang Huizhao came from northern Shandong and then went to Dezhou. After Pan Yizhi arrived in Ping, he went to Tianjin. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle in Northern Xuchang</h3>
<p>Feng's Army About to Abandon Heshangqiao</p>
<p>Wei Fenglou's Counterattack Repelled</p>
<p>Nanjing: Telegram from Luohe on the 14th: (1) From the 9th to the 13th, the fighting north of Xuchang has been fierce, rarely seen recently. The majority of Feng's army has retreated to Heshangqiao, relying on the perilous terrain for defense. Xiao Zhichu has captured three of their battalion commanders. According to prisoner Regiment Commander Li Shisheng, Feng's army has indeed been fully deployed, leaving Shaanxi empty. Bandits are rampant, and Jing Yueshu's troops have been heard near Xi'an, with an unclear attitude. Feng has secretly instructed Shi Jingting to return to Shaanxi to arrange for rear area affairs and is extremely fearful about the issue of Fengtian sending troops, saying that it is Yan's responsibility. (2) The enemy Wei Fenglou launched a counterattack against me on the morning of the 13th with the strength of two divisions but was bravely repelled by my 90th and 2nd armies. The enemy suffered approximately 3,000 casualties, and we also suffered some casualties. The front line is solid, and the more the enemy counterattacks, the faster they will collapse. (3) The bullets captured from Feng's army at the front are still mostly of Russian manufacture, which can serve as evidence of Feng's connection to Red Russia. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Japan's Economic Recession</h3>
<p>The Japanese often use the term "economic recession," which essentially means "instability." Japanese cabinet members believe that the current unprecedented economic recession is affecting the political sphere, leading many to advocate for shifting from austerity policies to active development to rescue the recession. However, Hamaguchi argues that abandoning austerity policies would further weaken commerce and lead to a deeper recession. Consequently, the strategies to rescue the recession are diverging into two extremely opposite paths.</p>
<p>It is believed that the arrival of world events must have its origin. The current economic recession in Japan is certainly influenced by the global recession. However, the cause of this global recession is very different from the recession after the European War. The global economy after the European War can be said to be extremely recessionary, but its origin was only due to temporary wartime disruptions that temporarily deviated from the normal track. Therefore, after countries made efforts to reorganize and vigorously develop industry and commerce, the effect of active policies was achieved in just a few years, and the economy suddenly returned to stability. However, as a result of active development, the seeds of imbalanced development of production and trade were planted. Only when production and consumption increase equally can a stable situation be maintained. If factory production increases sharply on one side, and the purchasing power of the market sharply decreases on the other side, then changes will naturally occur due to overproduction. Today's economic instability is eating the influence of this unbalanced development. If we still want to use the active methods of rescuing the instability after the European War to rescue today's unstable trend, I am afraid that the result will not only be useless but also harmful. If we abandon the policy of revitalizing industry and have other so-called active paths, then we have not yet discovered it.</p>
<p>The world economy will never be stable. It is either gradually returning to the normal track and returning to its previous stable state, or it is moving farther and farther away from the normal track and eventually falling into an unmanageable state of chaos from instability. It all depends on how those in power and with great power in the governments of various countries deal with it. This is truly a major issue today.</p>

<p>Nanjing: Military news - Feng's troops in eastern Xuchang, after being fiercely attacked by the Shangguan Yunxiang and Hao Menglin divisions, retreated in disarray. In Heshangqiao, there is the 12th Division, and to the south is the Fourth Division, all of which have built solid fortifications. Now, a part of our 7th Army and Xiao Zhichu's vanguard have crossed the location of those fortifications. The rebel troops in the northwest are being attacked from both sides and are in an extremely awkward position, likely to abandon Heshangqiao. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Compilation of Military Reports from Various Sides</h3>
<p>Nanjing: The Garrison Headquarters announced military information on the 14th: (1) The rebel enemy in Qingcheng Shuangtangzhen was fiercely attacked by us and collapsed to the northeast, and the rebel enemy in the Majia Xin Zhuang area also withdrew to Yangjiakou, but most of the enemy retreated to Qinghezhen. (2) The rebel enemy in Dong'e was thrown bombs by our planes and was very chaotic, preparing to escape. (3) The rebel enemy's artillery fire on the Luokou front was suppressed by our army's fierce artillery fire and has been silent in recent days, not daring to return fire. (4) Since the rebel troops have been repeatedly defeated by our army, they have suffered heavy losses and their supplies have been cut off. Although they are now relying on fortresses to wait for reinforcements, there are no more troops in the rear to be reinforced. They have no choice but to dig deep trenches and build high walls, awaiting their demise. Our army decided to strategically transfer the battlefield and separately deploy to fight the enemy. On the days of Zhengzhen and other days, our various units have reached the predetermined position. The enemy, without further investigation, actually exhausted their remaining strength to pounce on us. Our troops on the front line immediately defended the terrain to attack, and at the same time, our assembled fresh troops from the rear unexpectedly launched a flank attack and violently suppressed the rebel enemy. The rebel enemy was caught off guard, lost their advance and retreat, and the entire line swayed, becoming extremely chaotic. For a time, they fled in all directions, and corpses lay everywhere. It is estimated that the number of enemy troops injured and killed in this battle was at least 6,000. Among those captured, the Song Zheyuan's detachment alone had 5,000 people. The rest are still under investigation. From this point on, the main force of Feng's rebel army was almost completely annihilated. It is heard that Song has been seriously injured. Our army is now pursuing and clearing out the remaining enemy. (5) The rebel enemy Zhang Weixi's troops have been completely defeated by us for days. Feng, fearing that his rear would be cut off, urgently transferred Sun Lianzhong, Wei Fenglou, and others to support him, but they could only hold on to the stronghold and could not counterattack us. It is expected that they can be annihilated in one fell swoop within days. (6) The rebel enemy's armored car was destroyed by our army on the side of the railway, and many were captured. The morale of our army is extremely high. If the rebel enemy resists again, they will be unable to withstand an attack. (7) A part of our army has occupied the Hengshan Zhuting Nanyue area and cut off the rebel enemy's retreat. (8) The rebel Li Zongren led his remnant troops to Yongyang Baoqing in disarray.

<p>Valuation of the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<h3>Widely Divergent Chinese and Russian Claims</h3>
<p>Harbin: Regarding the issue of China's purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER), China estimates the railway's assets to be 500 million yuan. As the railway is a joint venture between China and Russia, China only needs to pay half of the total amount, or 250 million yuan, to achieve its long-standing goal. However, Russia claims that its investment in the CER amounts to 500 million yuan, and if the 30 years of interest are added, the total reaches 1.5 billion yuan. However, China believes that if Russia insists on this, China can use the Russian imperial note from the time the CER was built to purchase it, without using cash. According to Russia's calculation, the investment amount for the CER is: 365,649,541.17 yuan for construction costs in 1896, 27,207,648.37 yuan for improvement costs, and 178,579,617.95 yuan for loss compensation up to 1914, totaling 571,436,907.49 yuan. Furthermore, Russia's estimated value of the CER's assets is 1.6 billion yuan, while China's estimate is 500 million yuan, a difference of 1.1 billion yuan. (14th Telecommunications News)</p>

<h3>Agency Expenditures Temporarily Follow Past Practice</h3>
<p>Nanjing: The National Government's Financial Committee previously planned to separately compile the FY19 budget and the budget and final account procedures for FY18 and earlier and submit them for promulgation. However, due to the current situation, central and provincial local agencies are facing difficulties and have largely failed to implement them. Since the military expenses have been disbursed on a monthly basis without a fixed standard since the outbreak of military operations, it is particularly difficult for the Ministry of Military Affairs to prepare the aforementioned budget. The Ministry of Finance has sent the FY19 budgets of its affiliated financial agencies to the Central Political Council for review. After discussions by the Political and Financial Groups, it was believed that this was a partial matter and that the Ministry of Finance should still compile the entire budget and send it to the Council for approval. Now that FY19 is about to begin, it is heard that after discussions with the Audit Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, a method has been agreed upon. The expenditures of various agencies will be temporarily issued in accordance with the amount disbursed in the same month of the previous fiscal year as an expedient measure.

<p>The List of Cabinet Members Has Been Approved by the New King</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania, National News Agency, 13th. The Romanian government has been formed by Dr. Mironescu, the leader of the National Farmers' Party.

The Minister of Foreign Affairs remains Mironescu, while the Minister of Public Works is Carol's close friend, Manorescu.

<p>US Senate</p>
<h3>Passes New Tariff Act</h3>
<p>To Be Submitted to the President for Approval After Passage by the House of Representatives</p>
<p>Opponents Say It Will Increase the Burden on the Public</p>
<p>Washington, National News Agency, 13th. The Senate today passed the tariff act by a vote of 44 to 42. The bill is now awaiting passage by the House of Representatives and submission to President Hoover for approval. Although there are rumors that Hoover will veto it, it is expected that the procedures can be completed within a few days. When the Senate voted today, the audience was packed with famous politicians and large merchants. Senator Smoot, chairman of the Tariff Committee, estimates that the bill will increase the Treasury's annual revenue by US$1,070,000,000. However, Democratic opponents claim that after the implementation of the new tariffs, both imported foreign goods and domestically produced goods in the United States will increase in price, and the American public will spend an additional US$1,000,000,000 each year. They also claim that other countries are also increasing taxes to counteract the United States, making it more difficult to sell American goods abroad in the future. The overproduction in the United States will worsen, and the number of unemployed will inevitably increase.</p>

<h3>Disaster in British Motorboat Race</h3>
<p>Sir Henry Seagrave Dies</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 13th. Sir Henry Seagrave, who set a new world motorcar speed record last March in the United States by driving the British motorcar Golden Arrow at a speed of 231.36 miles per hour, died this afternoon in a motorboat speed trial on Lake Windermere in the United Kingdom. The boat he was driving, named Miss England II, completed three laps. The speed of the first lap was 96.1 miles per hour, the second lap was 101.11 miles per hour, and the average was 98.76 miles per hour, surpassing the record of 96.25 miles per hour set by the American Wood in the American motorboat Miss America. The speed was even greater on the third lap, and the sound of its 4,000-horsepower engine shook both banks. Unexpectedly, the boat suddenly disappeared into the water. Spectators screamed. After a few seconds, the boat surfaced, but the bottom was up with a large hole. Other boats rushed to rescue. Seagrave was rescued but had suffered serious injuries and was unconscious. He was immediately sent to the west bank and three doctors were urgently summoned. It was found that one arm and one leg had been severed, and the ribs had pierced the lungs. There was no hope of recovery, and he died at 5:00 PM, at the age of 34. Two other people were on board. One was the First Mate, Wilcox, who was also rescued with a severed leg. The other was the Mechanic, Halley, who has not yet been recovered and is presumed to have drowned. Miss England II sank to the bottom of the lake within half an hour after the accident.</p>
<h3>French Parliament Debates Vietnam Case</h3>
<p>Paris, National News Agency, 13th. The debate on the unrest in Vietnam has now concluded in the French parliament. There were intense debates at times, especially on Friday afternoon when the Minister of Colonies replied to the criticism of the opposition party. When he attributed the responsibility for inciting simple-minded scholars to resist the government to the Communist Party, the debate was at its most intense. At that time, the Communist Party criticized the autocracy and monopolization of power by the Vietnamese Governor-General and the French government, which did not allow the Vietnamese to participate in politics, as the main cause of the unrest. Furthermore, the Minister of Finance firmly refused to disclose the use of the French government's misappropriation of 600 million francs of national currency, only vaguely revealing that it was transferred to national emergency expenses. From this, it can be seen that the previous assumption that it was allocated to secret military expenses that the parliament had not approved was not a mere conjecture. The French newspapers are all keeping silent on this matter, and it is expected that the parliament will also shelve the issue. Many members of parliament said that in view of Mussolini's recent speech and the resulting tensions on the southeastern border, the government should take extraordinary measures.</p>
<p>Paris, Reuters, 13th. The French Minister of Colonies stated in the Chamber of Deputies today that the recent disturbances in Vietnam were undoubtedly due to the Communist Party's propaganda. The Communist Party's organization has sufficient financial resources and strict discipline. It is heard that this organization is working in conjunction with the Communist Party headquarters in Guangzhou. The government will definitely eliminate the Communist Party's activities in the colonies. The government's policy is to severely punish the leaders of the party and treat the people with leniency. He also stated that France's position in Vietnam has not been shaken in the slightest.</p>

<h3>Estimated Amount of Savings in Various Japanese Provinces</h3>
<p>All Sent to the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Tokyo, Electric Communication Society, 14th. The estimated amount of savings in each province that will implement the budget for the 5th year of the Showa era was all sent to the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance yesterday. Except for the Ministry of Finance, the amount of savings extracted by each province was less than expected. The Ministry of Finance plans to request the provinces to extract more financial resources. However, among the 30 million yuan allocated to the Ministry of the Navy for material expenses, 20 million yuan is for shipbuilding expenses, which is impossible to reduce. There is no other way than to extract 5 million yuan from other parts.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>Third Reading of the Land Law Passed</p>
<p>To Be Submitted to the National Government for Promulgation</p>
<p>The Legislative Yuan held its 95th meeting at 8:00 AM today (the 14th). Twenty-eight members, including Lyu Zhiyi, Shi Shangkuan, Jiao Yitang, Chen Zhaoying, and Lin Bin, attended. Chairman Hu Hanmin brought up the Land Law for third reading after the meeting began. After detailed study of each article and clause by the members, it was unanimously agreed that this law was important and no word, however small, should be taken lightly. The original law consisted of 405 articles. After discussion and revision, the original articles were merged into 397 articles and fully passed. It will be submitted to the National Government for promulgation today.</p>
<h3>Dispute over Water Conservancy Jurisdiction between Ministries and Commissions</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan Orders the Construction Committee to Submit a Review for Handling</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan yesterday instructed the Construction Committee regarding discrepancies between its handling of water conservancy matters and the original plan, stating, "According to the Ministry of Interior's report, matters related to water conservancy administration originally fall under the jurisdiction of this Ministry, while the Construction Committee also has a Water Conservancy Department that handles all water conservancy construction matters. It is naturally necessary to concentrate technical personnel to promote the development of water conservancy projects nationwide. However, since the jurisdictions have not been clearly defined, there may be difficulties in handling matters. The previous table of work distribution during the period of political tutelage, drafted by the ministries and commissions, was submitted to the Central Political Conference for review, and conflicts arose from the listing of various water conservancy items. After consultation between the ministries and commissions, it was agreed that the Construction Committee would consult with the Ministry on matters related to the jurisdiction of this Ministry when handling water conservancy projects. In March of this year, a joint letter was sent to the Political Reporting Group of the Political Conference for reference. This time, the proposal of the Construction Committee to unify water conservancy administration for the sake of streamlining authority and promoting progress was issued. Item 3 of the original plan listed methods for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work with this Committee to recover the management of various foreign-managed agencies. The Committee had previously requested the recovery of the foreign-managed Haihe River Engineering Bureau, and the request was issued to this Ministry and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to handle in conjunction with the Committee. The Committee did not include this Ministry in the proposal. The Committee's submission of the Hunan-Hubei Lake and River Water Conservancy Survey Plan is a matter related to the jurisdiction of this Ministry and was not consulted with this Ministry in advance. This situation is generally inconsistent with the original agreement between the ministries and commissions and hinders the progress of this Ministry's work. A document is prepared and submitted to request your review and approval of how to clearly define the jurisdictions to assign responsibilities and facilitate progress. After reviewing the Ministry's report, it is determined that the report's claims that it is inconsistent with the original agreement between the ministries and commissions concerns the jurisdiction of ministries and commissions. In addition to instructions, the Committee is ordered to thoroughly review the case and submit a reply for verification and handling."</p>
<h3>Transportation Ministry Submits Opinions on the Authority of Navigation Administration</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation previously drafted an organizational regulation for the Bureau of Navigation Administration and submitted it to the Legislative Yuan for review. After repeated reviews by the Legislative Yuan's Legislative Committee, it was determined that the duties of the Bureau of Navigation Administration, the current customs' acting management, and matters that should be under local management required clear demarcation of authority. A request was made to the Executive Yuan for a preliminary resolution before further deliberation. The Executive Yuan then instructed the Ministry of Transportation to draft a detailed statement of opinions on the duties and authority of the Bureau of Navigation Administration for reference. The ministry immediately complied and submitted this statement to the Executive Yuan yesterday, stating in brief: Since the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee resolved and confirmed the jurisdiction of administrative matters, the third item stipulates that maritime affairs are under the management of the Ministry of the Navy and navigation affairs are under the management of the Ministry of Transportation. Subsequently, the 35th meeting of the Executive Yuan decided to delineate the scope of maritime and navigation affairs and submitted it to the Central Political Council for approval, which was then forwarded to the Legislative Yuan to amend and promulgate the organizational laws of the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of the Navy separately. The scope of navigation affairs under the Ministry of Transportation was thus determined. The current draft of the organizational regulation for the Bureau of Navigation Administration is based on the provision in Article 5 of the ministry's organizational law that allows for the establishment of various navigation administration bureaus. Articles 4, 5, and 6 of the regulation list the duties of the Bureau of Navigation Administration based on the various matters under the jurisdiction of the Navigation Affairs Department in Article 10 of the ministry's organizational law. Regarding the demarcation of authority for matters under customs' acting management, local management, and the self-established navigation administration bureaus in various provinces, further explanation is provided: (1) Matters under customs' acting management: The resolution of the Central Political Council states that various parts currently under customs' acting management shall temporarily remain as is. The phrase "acting management" indicates that it is not primary management, and "temporarily remain as is" indicates that it is not permanent. Furthermore, when the Ministry of Finance proposed the delineation of maritime and navigation affairs last year, it expressed strong support for the various items within the scope of navigation affairs. However, it suggested that the two matters of navigation route markers and pilotage of vessels should remain under the jurisdiction of the customs for better management. Other matters, such as supervising shipping, inspecting ships, dredging navigation routes, managing ports, and examining ship personnel, should all be under the management of the Ministry of Transportation. The organizational regulation for the Bureau of Navigation Administration does not include provisions for pilotage of vessels, and the terms "supervising" or "managing" in the provisions for navigation route markers are intended to exercise supervisory authority over matters handled by the customs and to assume management responsibility for matters not handled by the customs. This is in accordance with the proposal of the Ministry of Finance to facilitate flexible handling. The phrase "or managing" in Article 6, Paragraph 1 of the regulation will now be deleted to clarify responsibilities and authority. (2) Matters under local management: The resolution of the Central Political Council last year stipulated that port affairs such as docks, warehouses, navigation markers within ports, and shipyards are under local management, but should still be subject to the direction and supervision of the central competent authority. Thus, although port affairs such as docks and warehouses may be managed by local authorities, they cannot be free from central supervision. The only local agency managing port affairs is the Port Authority under the municipal government. The organizational laws of provincial and county governments do not explicitly provide for the management of port affairs. Moreover, docks and warehouses are common to all ports, but not all ports have municipal governments, and not all municipal governments have port authorities (Article 15 of the Municipal Organization Law stipulates that the municipal government may, with the approval of the superior agency, establish the following bureaus as needed: 1. Education Bureau, 2. Health Bureau, 3. Land Bureau, 4. Public Works Bureau, 5. Port Authority). Currently, the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Port Authority has been suspended by order of the Executive Yuan, and the Tianjin Municipal Port Authority has also been abolished. The Hankou Municipal Port Authority has not yet been established. Since the Ministry of Transportation is responsible for directing and supervising port affairs related to navigation administration, the Bureau of Navigation Administration, under the Ministry of Transportation, will exercise supervisory authority over localities with established port authorities and must assume management responsibility for localities without established port authorities. The meaning of "supervising" or "managing" in Article 5, Paragraph 2 of the organizational regulation is consistent with the spirit of the Central Political Council's resolution and can achieve flexibility and maximize benefits. Furthermore, the second item of the 205th meeting of the Central Political Council resolved that the authority of the central and local governments in navigation affairs and the authority among the central ministries and commissions should be stipulated by the Legislative Yuan in the navigation administration laws and regulations. The organizational regulation for the Bureau of Navigation Administration is one of the navigation administration laws and regulations. How this authority should be stipulated to be appropriate should be considered and handled by the Legislative Yuan. (3) Matters concerning the self-established navigation administration bureaus in various provinces: Various provinces have many criticisms of customs' acting management of navigation administration, and the central competent authority does not have a dedicated bureau for management. Therefore, provinces such as Guangdong and Hubei have established their own navigation administration bureaus. Other provinces have established ship management offices or inspection offices to issue ship licenses and collect fees without reporting to the central competent authority for approval. The methods of self-administration in the provinces are inconsistent, and the establishment of navigation administration bureaus in various provinces has no basis in the organizational laws of the provincial governments. Therefore, there is no objection to the establishment of bureaus by the Ministry, and some have even expressed their support in official correspondence. In the future, when the Ministry establishes bureaus in accordance with the law, the bureaus established by the various provinces should be merged into the central government to emphasize legal authority and maintain political unity. Moreover, various shipping associations and chambers of commerce in various localities have repeatedly petitioned, stating that the provincial governments or municipal governments have arbitrarily established bureaus to handle navigation administration with inconsistent policies, leaving them at a loss. They urge the Ministry to find a way to abolish these bureaus and quickly establish a unified navigation administration agency for direct management to centralize authority and avoid disputes. These petitions have accumulated into a pile of documents, indicating that the self-established navigation administration bureaus in various provinces not only frequently cause disputes but also violate public opinion. The above-mentioned points are all closely related to the duties and authority of the Bureau of Navigation Administration. Since the Ministry has its own views, it should explain them in detail to avoid creating doubts.</p>

<h3>Indictment Filed in the Case of Murdering a Chinese</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The case of Ono Inosuke and Hirose Takeshi, crew members of the Daikichi steamer of the Nisshin Company of Japan, who jointly stabbed and killed the Chinese worker Wang Hailin with knives at the company's wharf in Wuxue on January 4 of this year, has now been concluded by the Hankou District Court's investigation and prosecution was initiated on the 12th of this month. It is noted that after the National Government announced the abolition of foreign extraterritoriality in China, the Hankou District Court has handled Chinese-foreign cases. Apart from the case of He Dingkang, which has already been prosecuted, this is the second case. The indictment is recorded below: "Defendants: Ono Inosuke, Japanese nationality, not yet arrived; Hirose Takeshi, Japanese nationality, not yet arrived. The aforementioned defendants are charged with intentional injury resulting in death in Case No. 729 of the 19th year of the Republic of China. This office has concluded the investigation and deems it necessary to initiate a public prosecution. The facts of the crime, the reasons for prosecution, and the legal articles violated by the defendants are listed as follows: The Nisshin Company's merchant steamer Daikichi Maru was moored at the wharf in Wuxue on January 4 of this year. When worker Wang Hailin boarded the ship to purchase smuggled salt for delivery, crew members Ono Inosuke and Hirose Takeshi discovered and stopped him, leading to a conflict. Ono Inosuke and others then rushed back to the third floor to find knives to confront him. Wang Hailin followed closely behind, and as soon as he reached the stairs, he was stabbed by Ono Inosuke and others, instantly causing a hole in his abdomen with intestines protruding and blood flowing. After the incident, the crowd was in an uproar. Finally, the shipowner Sato Nobuji signed a certificate and took Wang Hailin to the Hankou Tongren Hospital for treatment. He died on the 6th of the same month. The victim's family member Wang Chen reported the incident for an examination. This office went to conduct the examination and confirmed the facts, filling out the form and attaching it to the file. Instructions were requested from the higher court to investigate and prosecute. According to Article 2 of the Measures for Handling Post-Abolition of the Diplomatic Bureau, all matters involving foreigners after the abolition of the Diplomatic Bureau shall be handled in the same manner as Chinese citizens, except as restricted by laws and regulations. Furthermore, on December 28, 1929, the National Government ordered that foreigners enjoying consular jurisdiction shall abide by Chinese laws from January 1, 1930. In this case, Ono Inosuke and Hirose Takeshi jointly injured worker Wang Hailin's intestines, and he died of his injuries before receiving treatment. This office has conducted an examination in accordance with the law and confirmed the facts, and there is a certificate from the shipowner of the Daikichi Maru, Sato Nobuji, which can serve as the sole evidence in this case. Although Ono Inosuke and Hirose Takeshi are of Japanese nationality, the facts of the crime occurred after the National Government explicitly abolished consular jurisdiction, and the incident took place within the territory of our country. Ono Inosuke and others should be subject to the sanctions and trials of our country's laws without any doubt. Ono Inosuke and Hirose Takeshi committed the crime of Article 296 of the Criminal Law of the Republic of China. Therefore, in accordance with Article 253, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, they are respectfully sent for public trial. To the Criminal Division of the same court, Prosecutor Wang Jue of the Hankou District Court." (June 13)</p>

<h3>Tragic Explosion at Changsha Ammunition Depot</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The Changsha Ammunition Depot was originally located in Lotus Pond. Due to carelessness in the early years of the Republic, it was burned down, causing extremely tragic deaths and injuries, and the entire building was destroyed. It was then moved to Sanguan Temple, where it has been for more than ten years. It stores a large amount of gunpowder, shells, bullets, percussion shells, hand grenades, rifles, and discarded cannons. When He Jian was in the province, the Fourth Route Army Headquarters Ordnance Department was also located here. Due to the rapid retreat, the ammunition stored in the depot could not be moved in time. After the Guangxi Army arrived in Changsha, its 24th Division Headquarters and the 3rd Brigade Headquarters were located in the depot. The division commander was Wang Xitao from Xiangxiang. The division headquarters was stationed with a special company and a battalion of new recruits. At 7:00 PM on the 10th, new recruits accidentally dropped a hand grenade while moving it, causing it to explode immediately. A ball of red fire ignited the gunpowder. With a loud bang, the roof tiles shook. While residents in the northern part of the city were still in a state of shock and suspicion, the fire inside the depot ignited various types of ammunition, causing an uncontrollable situation. Shells were flying in all directions, and roof tiles were scattered everywhere. Members of the division headquarters, such as the special company, were unable to escape because they were living upstairs and were all killed except for those who were away. The other companies of new recruits also suffered heavy casualties. Nearby residents immediately helped the elderly and the young to escape in all directions, and the sound of crying was deafening. The entire city's fire brigades and firefighting teams rushed to put out the fire, but the sound of exploding shells and cannons was deafening, and various types of bullets were also flying around, injuring people. All water hoses could only be prepared for rescue around Sanguan Temple and dared not move forward. The military police sent by Li Zongren and Feng Tianzhu could only maintain order and rescue refugees in the vicinity and could not approach to put out the fire. They had to let it burn. At that time, the entire city was declared under martial law, traffic was cut off, and the air became tense. The fire blazed into the sky, and the sound of cannons rumbled for seven hours. It was not until 1:00 AM on the 11th that the three rows of houses in the ammunition depot were burned down, and the sound of guns and cannons gradually subsided. The water hoses from all directions began to pour water to extinguish the fire, but it had spread extensively, and there were many sources of fire that were difficult to extinguish. It was not extinguished until 7:00 AM on the 11th. The entire area of Sanguan Temple, Sima Lane, and Sima Bridge was reduced to scorched earth. Dozens of houses were burned down, and hundreds of people were killed or injured. The detailed numbers could not be investigated because traffic was cut off in the fire area until noon on the 11th. It can be said to be a tragic calamity. Furthermore, at 11:00 PM on the 10th, inmates in the Changsha District Court Detention Center took advantage of the loud sound of cannons to break out of prison. The guard military police opened fire to stop them. The sound of gunfire erupted around the court. Although no prisoners escaped after the incident, nearby residents were terrified. (June 11)</p>

<h3>Rampant Banditry in Jiaoxian County</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Jiaoxian County is located in a remote coastal area and has always been a haven for bandits. The county originally had a 300-man security team with complete firearms, stationed in urban and rural areas, which slightly suppressed banditry. However, last autumn, the security team was reorganized into the provincial defense army by Liu Guanru, who took away the firearms, leaving the defense empty. Banditry became rampant. Later, thanks to the dispatch of troops by Fan Xiji's unit, the bandits fled at the sound of the wind and dared not openly commit crimes. When the situation changed, Fan's unit withdrew, and the western section of the Jiaozhou-Jinan Railway was taken over by Han Fuqu's unit. The eastern section near Jiaozhou Bay was taken over by the Marine Corps. However, Han's unit only deployed to Gaomi, and the Marine Corps only deployed to Chengyang. The entire area between Chengyang and Gaomi is under the jurisdiction of Jiaoxian County. There were no troops stationed, and the security inside the city was weak. Bandits took the opportunity to rise up in various places, and kidnapping and looting occurred daily. The gentry and merchants of the county, seeing the increasing banditry, sent representatives to Qingdao and Jinan to request troops for protection, but without results. This led to today's banditry. In total, the bandit leaders in the southern countryside are Sun Baoshan, Li Xiaoqi, and Zhu Daheshang, with about 500 to 600 bandits. They are entrenched in Lizhu and Liujiatun. Residents in the area have fled, and no fewer than hundreds of families have been affected. The bandit leaders in the eastern countryside are Feng Shaowu, Sun Fenglin, and Shang Hongsheng, entrenched in Madian and Zhazi. They extort supplies from nearby villages and send bandits to contact small groups of bandits to increase their strength. Yesterday, the county magistrate of Jiaoxian County, Ye Zhongying, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, Wang Zaitian, and representatives of various agencies in the county came to Qingdao again to request the navy to send troops to suppress the bandits.

<p>Hankou Correspondence: In recent days, due to the rumors of Zhang Guijun's army invading Hunan, the General Headquarters Wuhan Camp and the Garrison Headquarters in the three towns of Wuhan, for the sake of reassuring the people, executed Cai Guobao, who was privately transporting bullets to support the reactionaries, by firing squad on the afternoon of the 11th. At noon on the 12th, Deng Guowu, Yuan Zhusheng, and Li Ziqi, workers at the Hanyang Arsenal and squad leaders of the guard, were executed by firing squad by the camp. On the same afternoon, at 4:00 PM, four more prisoners were escorted to the open space on Jisheng Sanmalu by soldiers sent by the camp and executed by firing squad, without announcing their names or crimes. It is reported that Li Ziqi, who had already been executed, was a Hunan worker who was instigated by reactionaries to collude with Deng Guowu and Yuan Zhusheng, squad leaders of the guard at the Hanyang Arsenal, to plot a riot. Deng and Yuan had already received letters of appointment from the reactionaries and agreed on a date to start the uprising. After the 3rd Regiment of Military Police thoroughly investigated and arrested them, they were transferred to the camp for execution. After the execution, some people went to burn paper money and collect the bodies in coffins. In addition to holding a security meeting recently to decide to strengthen water and land inspections, protect prisoners in various prisons, strictly check mail, deploy troops to deal with reactionaries, and other measures, the Garrison Headquarters also posted a second proclamation on the 13th, stating that those who spread rumors and confuse the public will be executed. As a result, the rumors have subsided slightly, and people's hearts have gradually calmed down. (June 13)</p>
<h3>Military and Financial Situation in Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>Aircraft Go to the Hunan-Jiangxi Border for Reconnaissance</p>
<p>The Provincial Government Decides to Maintain the Circulation Notes</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Jiangxi and Hunan are adjacent to each other, sharing a close relationship. In order to investigate the situation between Hunan and Jiangxi, Lu Diping, the Ninth Route Army Commander-in-Chief, ordered the air force to fly to the western Jiangxi-Hunan border every day for reconnaissance. After receiving the order, Jiang, the section chief of the Aviation Administration, accompanied by technicians Zhao and Tang, flew to western Jiangxi on the "Shanghai-Chengdu" aircraft on the morning of the 8th and inspected the people of various counties under Ruizhou Prefecture. They were very peaceful. They then flew to Pingxiang, which was also as peaceful as usual. They flew to Zhuzhou and Liling in Hunan and returned to the province at 12:00 noon. Jiang immediately went to the provincial government to report everything to Lu. At 7:00 AM this morning, they flew along the Gan River to Ganzhou and various places in southern Jiangxi for reconnaissance. It was also very peaceful. However, Fenyi in western Jiangxi was again captured by the communist bandit Peng Dehuai. The New 13th Division is heading there to suppress them and it will not be difficult to quell them. On the military front, Lu is taking care of both suppressing the rebellion and suppressing the bandits, so the various troops have been somewhat redeployed. During this troop deployment, the issue of military pay has been addressed. Lu has submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance, and Minister Song ordered Special Commissioner Liu to quickly raise one month's salary. Special Commissioner Liu has already distributed more than 200,000 yuan of national taxes collected by tax collection agencies to various divisions and borrowed 80,000 yuan from the business community to make up the amount to facilitate military needs. However, at this time of military affairs, rumors are rampant, causing the circulation notes issued by the Department of Finance to be somewhat affected, falling to 85%. The provincial government is paying close attention to this and decided at yesterday's provincial affairs meeting to redeem the circulation notes for May and June immediately. The business community also sent representatives from the financial sector to visit Finance Director Chen to ask for ways to maintain the unexpired circulation notes so that the lowest discount should not fall below 95%. As a result, the price of these notes has rebounded slightly to 90%. (9th)</p>

As for the ship encountering a hurricane, sinking, and drowning over a hundred people, this is entirely untrue. The Yangchang passenger ship has been traveling back and forth several times. This concerns our reputation, and we are obligated to inform you of the truth to clarify the facts. Sincerely, Shaobo Litong Company, June 11th.</p>

<p>Headquarters Announced Yesterday</p>
<p>Navigation Industry Complies and Suspends Operations</p>
<p>Since the remnants of Zhang Guizhi's forces have fled to various locations, the Central Army is now planning to encircle and suppress them. Yesterday, the headquarters sent a public telegram to Shanghai, ordering the Shanghai navigation industry to announce this matter. The Central Government has adopted appropriate measures to block the mouth of the Xiang River, allowing Chinese and foreign ships to avoid danger and prevent merchants from transporting goods to Hunan in vain. The details of this matter are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Order to Stop Navigation in Xiang River: The telegram from the headquarters stated: "The remnants of Zhang Guizhi's forces have fled into Hunan. The Central Government has dispatched a large army to encircle and eliminate them. The mouth of the Xiang River is a vital waterway, and to prevent their escape, the navy has been ordered to implement a blockade, prohibiting Chinese and foreign merchant ships and other vessels from passing through the area to ensure caution." All companies are ordered to take note.</p>
<p>Six Companies Suspend Runs: There are six shipping companies operating between Hankou and Changsha in Hubei and Hunan. Foreign companies such as Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Nissin have been formally notified by the diplomatic authorities to inform their respective consulates. Chinese companies such as China Merchants and Sanbei have first suspended the runs of the Changsha passenger ships Lijian, Hongyuan, and Hongheng. Foreign ships from Britain and Japan are also said to have complied. The route to Changsha is completely blocked and impassable.</p>
<p>Negotiate Standard Prices: After the blockade order was issued, foreign merchants requested that China allow one ship to pass through each week to maintain the convenience of waterway transportation between Hunan and Hubei for passengers and goods. This matter is likely to be approved. This plan will be implemented jointly by the six companies. Chinese and foreign shipping companies are negotiating to formulate standard prices for passenger and cargo transportation after the river blockade to ensure compliance. The headquarters also stated that once the rebel forces are eliminated, the river blockade order will be lifted and the original state will be restored.</p>
<h3>Artillery Shell Lands in Residence</h3>
<p>One Woman Killed by Explosion</p>
<p>Two Rooms Destroyed</p>
<p>At about 11:30 AM yesterday, a shell suddenly fell from the sky into the home of Chen Fenglai, a farmer in Gujiazhai, Shidongkou, outside the North Gate of Baoshan, destroying two tiled rooms. At that time, Chen Fenglai's mother, Chen Yinshi, was working at home and was tragically killed. Chen's mother, 41 years old, suffered injuries to her shoulder, chest, and other areas, with flesh and blood blurred. After the incident, Chen Fenglai returned home upon hearing the news and mourned over the body. He immediately reported to the Baoshan First District Public Office. It was later learned that the shell came from the Shanghai Arsenal, which had sent over ten people to the north end of the Wusong Pao Taiwan coast around 9:00 AM yesterday to test-fire several mortars. The shells were supposed to fall into the river, but one of them was launched particularly far and mistakenly penetrated the Chen family's house, causing the tragedy. The adjutant of the arsenal went to the Baoshan County Government to explain the circumstances of the shell's misfire. Chen Fenglai, along with the First District Chief Sun, also reported to the county government, stating that his mother had died unnaturally and requesting 300 yuan for her funeral. However, the arsenal's adjutant only agreed to pay 40 yuan. The county government temporarily advanced 60 yuan, making a total of 100 yuan, and handed it over to Chen Fenglai for the deceased's coffin and funeral expenses. It will also submit a request for compensation and bereavement money. Qiu, the county magistrate of Baoshan, has dispatched trial officer Zhang to inspect the body and investigate the circumstances in order to review and approve the case.</p>

<p>Industry and Commerce Conference</p>
<h3>Preparatory Office Established in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Third National Industry and Commerce Conference is scheduled to be held in early September this year. Industry and Commerce Minister Kong Xiangxi believes that it is necessary to gather experts and industry leaders from all over the country to discuss relief measures at a time when gold is expensive and silver is cheap, and industry and commerce are in decline. With the conference approaching, he has prepared a budget and regulations and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for record, and instructed the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds. He has also distributed notices so that representatives and experts from various provinces can prepare adequately in advance, and remote provinces can also arrive on time. Considering that Shanghai is a major port in East Asia and a hub of industry and commerce, he has first established a preparatory office in Shanghai to ensure that all preparatory matters are carried out smoothly. The ministry has instructed the Director of the Commerce Department to come to Shanghai to preside over the office. The address is temporarily at the National Products Bank.</p>
<h3>Silver Reserves in This Port Increase Again</h3>
<p>Actual Reserves of 230 Million Taels</p>
<p>Silver reserves in this port exceed demand, leading to a sharp drop in silver prices. According to a survey yesterday, as of this week (14th), the actual silver reserves in this port, including silver ingots and standard silver, totaled 113,675,000 taels, a decrease of 577,000 taels compared to last week. Silver dollars totaled 160,460,000 yuan, an actual increase of 3,330,000 yuan, equivalent to an increase of 1,921,000 taels.</p>
<h3>Commodity Prices Continue to Rise Unabated</h3>
<p>Since last month, commodity prices in this port have risen by several times due to the impact of gold and silver prices. Recently, the prices of various goods imported from overseas have risen by several times again. The price of gasoline has more than doubled, and the cost of car rentals has also increased by one-third. The prices of various manufactured goods and transportation services that require gasoline have all increased. The price of cigarettes has also increased by dozens of yuan per case, and Chinese cigarettes have also increased in price accordingly. The average price of foreign paper has increased by about 35%, and the price of printing supplies has increased by one-third to one-half. The prices of other foods and sundries have also increased. Based on the current situation, it is feared that prices will continue to rise, which will have a significant impact on society and people's livelihoods.</p>

<h3>Wakatsuki Leaves Shanghai for Home Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wakatsuki, the representative of the Japanese Naval Disarmament Conference, his son, and his entourage left Shanghai to return to Japan yesterday. Yesterday morning, he hosted guests from all walks of life at the Japanese Consulate for farewells.

At around 10:00 AM, he accompanied his son and the entire entourage to the original ship Kitano Maru. The acting Japanese ambassador Shigemitsu, military attachés from the Navy and Army, officials from the Japanese Consulate, and military police escorted him to the ship, which sailed at 11:00 AM. Many Chinese and Japanese officials and gentry saw him off. Director Chen from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also came to the wharf to see him off. Before departing, Wakatsuki expressed his gratitude to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the mayor of Hangzhou, Zhou, for their warm hospitality and asked Shigemitsu to convey his thanks on his behalf.</p>
<h3>The Italian Consul-General, Mr. Gallarati, Transferred</h3>
<p>Mr. Cortese Sclocic Succeeds Him</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the Italian Consulate-General in this port received a telegram from Italy yesterday (the 13th), stating that the current Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Gallarati, has been transferred back to the Foreign Ministry to serve. The vacant position has been filled by the appointment of Count Cortese Sclocic, the eldest son-in-law of Prime Minister Mussolini. He is expected to arrive in Shanghai to take up his new post in early September. Count Cortese is the son of the current Minister of Transportation and is only twenty-seven years old. Because his father has been elevated to nobility by the Italian King, he has inherited the title of Count. He initially worked in journalism and later entered the diplomatic service, serving in the Italian Embassy in China for many years. He is not only fluent in Chinese but also deeply familiar with Chinese customs and traditions. A talented young man, he was chosen by Mussolini to be his son-in-law and married his eldest daughter on April 24th in Rome.</p>
<h3>Protest Against the American Consulate's Arrest of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Lawyer Wu Chengyu of this port sent a letter to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of Wu Shihua, a returned overseas Chinese from Taishan, Guangdong, who wrote to me stating that he married Lattie Wah in New York City, New York State, in March 24th, 1926, and on May 6th, 1928, they had a son named Wu Sheng, who is now three years old and still in his infancy. On May 3rd of this year, they boarded the President McKinley ship in Seattle and arrived in Shanghai on the morning of May 20th. Unexpectedly, upon arrival, the American Consul in Shanghai arrested the father and son. The consulate prosecutor interrogated and detained them for four hours (from 10 AM to 2 PM), only releasing the father and detaining the son, Wu Sheng, in the consulate. On the next day (May 21st), they instructed him to go to the consulate to await a reply from New York, but he went three times and received no information. He requests legal protection, etc. Upon investigation, Wu Shihua is a Chinese citizen. If the consul believes he has committed any illegal acts, he should legally issue a warrant to the Shanghai Special District Court for arrest. Moreover, this is within the legal jurisdiction of the Concession Special District Court, and the consular jurisdiction only covers cases where Chinese citizens sue foreigners. How can they overstep their authority to try cases where foreigners sue Chinese citizens and violate our country's legal rights? Furthermore, according to Wu Shihua, the Western woman has already married a Chinese man. According to both Chinese and American laws, the wife follows the husband's nationality. Therefore, the consul cannot represent her to assert such actions. This matter may seem small concerning Wu Shihua personally, but it is significant concerning national legal rights. I fear that such actions will be emulated, and Chinese in the Concession will have no legal protection. The consequences are dire. This lawyer believes this case concerns national rights. In addition to sending letters to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and the American Consulate in Shanghai, I request that your office promptly negotiate with the consulate for a proper resolution, as Wu Sheng is a three-year-old child, and his life is at stake. This is to ensure that overseas Chinese know that the government is earnestly protecting them and to maintain friendly relations." The letter to the American Consul is largely the same, requesting the prompt release of Wu Sheng.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Standing Committee Meeting of the Municipal Executive Committee</h3>
<p>The 23rd Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee held its 23rd Standing Committee meeting yesterday, chaired by Fan Zhengbo. Excerpts from the resolutions are as follows: (1) It has been found that there are many corrupt private universities (commonly known as "Wild Chicken Universities") in this municipality. These schools are solely for profit, and their curriculum and management are extremely lax. The laxity of their curriculum causes students to go astray. The military and political authorities in this municipality have recently arrested communists and various reactionaries, most of whom, apart from a few idle intellectuals and workers, are students from these "Wild Chicken Universities." The facts are undeniable. It is clear that these schools are breeding grounds for reactionaries. In order to get to the root of the problem, we are submitting a proposal with reasons for review. (Resolution) Submitted to the Central Government. (2) The Second District Party Headquarters submitted a request from its 27th Sub-Branch to launch a memorial service for Comrade Fan Zheng'luo to honor the martyrs and console their spirits. (Resolution) Passed and handed over to the Civil Training Committee to prepare. The date is set for July 15th. (3) Comrade Zhu Yingpeng submitted a letter resigning from the Labor Education Committee. Request for approval. (Resolution) Persuade him to stay.

Requesting approval for implementation. (Resolution) A letter should be sent to the Municipal Government to earnestly negotiate the recovery of the roads built beyond the boundary and inform the Fourth District. (5) The Civil Training Committee raised the issue of foreign merchants establishing match factories and implementing economic aggression, endangering the livelihoods of millions of match workers across China.

(6) The Civil Training Committee raised the issue based on the request from the British-American Tobacco Factory Union to allocate the housing in Lan Ni Du, Pudong, as a workers' school when the Ministry of Railways seals off the assets of the traitor Wang Weizhou. This is not appropriate to decide independently. Requesting review and resolution. (Resolution) Transferred to the Central Government. (7) The Organization Department submitted 96 preliminary party member forms with complete procedures and a list of names for review and approval. (Resolution) Passed.</p>

<h3>Preparations for the Industrial and Commercial Management Association</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Industrial and Commercial Management Association previously held a meeting and resolved to change its name to the Chinese Scientific Management Association and drafted a concise constitution. This was reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the Preparatory Committee has recently received letters from industrial and commercial leaders advocating changing the name to the Chinese Business and Scientific Management Association or the Chinese Industrial and Commercial Scientific Management Association. Therefore, the final decision will be discussed in detail at the inaugural meeting on the 29th of this month. Regarding the association's future activities, it is currently seeking opinions from all parties. The following proposals have been submitted: (1) Pan Xulun's proposal to improve the accounting system for industrial organizations. (2) Liu Hongsheng's proposal to pilot cost accounting. (3) Qian Chengxu's proposal to hire efficiency engineers. (4) Li SheSong's proposal for Chinese factories to collectively purchase industrial raw materials to save waste and promote cooperation. Experts in industrial and commercial management who have recently returned from Europe and the United States believe that the establishment of this organization is urgently needed. They also stated that the adoption of scientific management methods in industry and commerce is widespread in various countries. Therefore, they plan to compile and translate a series of scientific management books for reference by industrial and commercial circles.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Bureau Limits Boat Licenses</h3>
<p>Boat Registration Ends at the End of This Month</p>
<p>Boats are simply constructed and can only navigate inland rivers. On the Huangpu River, they are dangerous when carrying passengers and cannot handle cargo. They have no fixed business and are cheap to operate, leading many unemployed and homeless people to use them for illegal activities, which has long been criticized by travelers on the Huangpu River, especially for transporting contraband, which endangers public security. The Public Utilities Bureau's registration, inspection, and licensing of these boats aims to gradually eliminate them. Therefore, it consulted with the Municipal Finance Bureau to exempt them from taxes. It is now learned that the total number of registered boats has reached 1,308. To limit the number of licenses, the Public Utilities Bureau plans to end boat registration on June 30th. From July 1st onwards, only transfers and returns of licenses will be allowed; no new licenses will be issued.</p>
<h3>Land Bureau Clears Up Household Land in South Shanghai</h3>
<p>Districts 12 and 13 of the 25th Ward in the South Shanghai Area</p>
<p>The Municipal Land Bureau announced that in Districts 12 and 13 of the 25th Ward in the South Shanghai area (east to the Huangpu River, south to Wangda Port, Bansongyuan Road, Chenjia Port, Shenjia Port, Tang Port, Yuque Port, west to Rihui Port, north to Youche Wharf Street, Xuejia Port Road, Fusantang Street, Jiangyin Street, and Zhaojiabang), many households have not registered their individual ownership since the Shanghai County Land Survey Bureau measured the land several years ago. Moreover, there have been many changes in the names of current owners due to transfers and sales, and many old sites have been lost due to the reconstruction of houses and the construction of roads. It is urgent to clear these issues up in order to reissue land ownership certificates. In addition to sending personnel to conduct investigations and respond to inquiries, the owners of the two districts are hereby notified to promptly obtain investigation forms from the bureau's enquiry office, fill in the required information, and submit them to the bureau as soon as possible. If they delay and miss the opportunity, the bureau will find it difficult to handle any disputes that may arise in the future.</p>
<h3>Disputes Over the Establishment of a Municipal Bank in North Shanghai</h3>
<p>A Letter from the North Shanghai Tax Collection Office</p>
<p>The Municipal Government plans to establish a municipal bank on Baoshan Road in Zhabei. It is reported that the Shi Ruiji Shoe Store at No. 181-187 Baoshan Road has been involved in disputes over relocation and has appealed to the mayor and the Occupational Guild. Yesterday, the North Shanghai Tax Collection Office sent a letter to the Occupational Guild. The original letter is copied below: "Regarding the matter of the Director of the Finance Bureau's instructions to use the four buildings at No. 181, 183, 185, and 187, south of the Zidetang Pharmacy on Baoshan Road, for the North Shanghai Branch of the Municipal Bank, and the proposal to grant a relocation fee of 290 yuan per building. This office sent a letter to the Wenxiao Company to persuade the tenants to relocate without any coercion or forced eviction. The report in the People's Republic Daily by your guild is inconsistent with the facts. The establishment of the Municipal Bank by the Municipal Government is for the purpose of circulating finances for the people and is for public use. There is no contradiction. The recovery of the property is the right of the owner, and the grant of relocation fees to persuade the tenants to move is not coercion. Your guild's report of forced eviction and request for assistance is based on one-sided information and a lack of understanding of the facts and is close to inciting trouble. Should the misunderstanding lead to a disturbance, who will be responsible? Therefore, we are disclosing the actual situation to clarify the truth." Addressed to: The Occupational Guild of North Shanghai Tax Collection Office, June 14th.</p>
<h3>Association of Chinese Cigarette Manufacturers Scheduled to Petition in Beijing</h3>
<p>On the 23rd of This Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Manufacturers Association has been experiencing various difficulties in its business, threatening its very survival. It convened an emergency meeting of all members and resolved to prepare a petition to Beijing in the hope of receiving relief. Preparations have been completed, and they are scheduled to depart for Beijing on the 23rd after the Guangdong petitioners arrive in Shanghai. It is learned that the association has received a reply from the Municipal Party Headquarters approving the transfer of the request to the Central Government for information. The Association of Merchants also sent a letter stating that it had received a request to send representatives to the capital to petition for relaxed price limits and changes in tax rates. After being referred to the Standing Committee for discussion, it was resolved at the 54th Standing Committee meeting to send committee members Yu Qiaqing and Wang Xiaolai to petition Finance Minister Song when he visits Shanghai, striving to alleviate the difficulties of the merchants. Sending representatives to the capital is not necessary at this time. In addition to notifying Yu and Wang, this letter is being sent to the association for your information. It is hoped that your association's representatives will consult with Yu and Wang.</p>
<h3>Suspension of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company</h3>
<p>A Report from the Social Affairs Bureau to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau reported to the Municipal Government yesterday that the reasons given by the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company for requesting the revocation of Instruction No. 2249 were insufficient. The report stated: "Regarding the matter of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's consultation on the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company's request for maintenance, along with the sub-report, contract receipt, and film, ordering an investigation and reply, this bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters agreed on four measures to be followed by both labor and management, and the details were reported on May 2nd. Before instructions were received, it was impossible to review the matter. On the 4th of this month, we received Instruction No. 5665 from the Municipal Government, ordering the revocation of Instruction No. 2249 issued by this bureau to the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company and ordering both labor and management to comply, etc. In accordance with this, we should comply. However, it still needs to be discussed as there are reasons that must be stated. The Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company claims to be one of the largest domestic enterprises, yet it abruptly suspended operations without following legal procedures, disregarding the livelihoods of thousands of workers. If other factories follow suit and disregard regulations and act arbitrarily, this bureau will be overwhelmed with difficulties. Regarding the submission of appeals to higher levels, which is not permitted by government regulations, and criticisms and rejections frequently seen in official documents, if we consider the four measures agreed upon by this bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters to be inappropriate, it should also be appealed to the direct supervisory authorities of this bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters for correction. The company disregards this, acts unilaterally, and defies the law. It is undeniable. In memory of the late Premier's legacy of supporting labor, witnessing the destruction of thousands of workers and their unemployment, we are deeply saddened. We have selected the flaws in the reasons given by the company and respectfully submit them to your excellency. (1) The company's payment of severance pay is based solely on the contract signed with labor on February 5th of this year. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce believes that this contract naturally has legal effect, and third parties cannot deny it. According to the establishment of a contract, the two parties should express consistent intentions. When one party has several people, its representative should first obtain full power of attorney in accordance with legal procedures before expressing its intentions to be valid. Workers have shallow knowledge and are easily deceived. Therefore, those engaged in the labor movement in various countries pay close attention to the production of worker representatives when signing labor agreements. It is not known how the labor representatives attending the contract signed by the company with labor on February 5th were produced. According to Article 1 of the treatment conditions negotiated by the company with labor on August 13th, 1927, the company's labor union is the legal representative of labor. Although the organization of employees may have changed afterward, the system has continued without any legal union officials responsible. If we assume that the representatives were temporarily elected by all employees, then according to the regulations for public gatherings of people in this city, where and when was the general meeting of thousands of employees held? Were party and government agencies sent to guide the meeting? Were there reports submitted afterward? It is impossible to investigate. The qualifications of the so-called labor representatives cannot represent the whole. It is not known whether the contract has legal effect in law. It remains to be studied, even from the perspective of the establishment of a settlement agreement. After the establishment, third parties cannot deny it, but the government is in a supervisory position, which is different from ordinary third parties. If the government can retreat to a third-party position in labor-management disputes and allow the two parties to freely negotiate contracts, regardless of whether they violate the law, then the labor force, which is not united and has weak intelligence, will inevitably be subject to inducement and coercion and will have no guarantee. If the factory law is implemented in the future, the capital side will also use its old tricks to sign contracts with a few self-proclaimed worker representatives, voluntarily giving up their rights under the factory law. Will the government also recognize that the two parties have signed a contract that third parties cannot deny and then stand by and watch? If so, it seems to be inconsistent with the party's meaning of protecting the interests of labor. It is rumored that a number of workers who acted as representatives at the time were colluded by the capital side, but there is no evidence, so it is difficult to believe. However, in order to prevent the capital side from coercion and enticement, the government must add appropriate intervention. Moreover, the qualifications of one party are already flawed, which is sufficient to prove that the contract is not in compliance, and it seems inappropriate to ignore the content of the contract that violates regulations. (2) The company also used the excuse of following the provisions of Article 1 under the B item of treatment in the labor-management agreement signed in 1927 for the payment of severance pay. Upon investigation, the company and labor signed treatment conditions on August 13th, 1927, with a footnote under the treatment item stating, "The above eleven articles concerning treatment conditions are temporary measures. After the National Government's labor law is promulgated, regardless of whether it is higher or lower, it shall be handled in accordance with the government's labor law." The company should comply with the labor laws and regulations of this city within the scope of this city. The interim measures for retirement treatment for employees in this city were promulgated on November 3rd, 1928, and were approved by the National Government. It is not known why the company did not comply with the procedures stipulated in the regulations for temporary suspension of business and insisted on the conditions negotiated by labor and capital. What a contradiction! (3) The company said that it was inconvenient to notify the labor side in advance for fear of causing disputes. How could it not report to the competent administrative authorities in advance in accordance with the regulations? If it did not report in advance and then made excuses, it was even more disrespectful to the government and defied the law. (4) Regarding the company's difficulties such as workers' arrogance and high tobacco taxes, the bureau has always considered the difficulties mentioned by the company. Although the issue of reducing tobacco taxes is beyond the authority of the bureau, it did submit a request to the Ministry for instructions. Regarding the management of workers, the bureau has also repeatedly comforted them. If workers are indeed arrogant, the company is allowed to establish management rules to ensure that they are on track. In short, the difficulties mentioned by the company cannot be resolved from the beginning. The company does not know the methods of business competition and only knows how to covet cheap wages. It has never valued the labor of thousands of employees over the years. Once, they are abandoned innocently, making them all unemployed. How can anyone with a heart bear to do this? Moreover, the cigarettes produced by entrusting other factories to produce them still have to pay tobacco tax. According to the company, each box of Da Lianzhu brand sells for 200 yuan. After implementing the 32.5% tax, each box must be taxed 53.6 yuan. Each box only has a wage of 26-27 yuan. The tax rate accounts for 26.8% of the selling price of each box, and the wage only accounts for 10.35% of the selling price of each box. The government is urgently planning to raise funds to establish a cause to relieve unemployed workers. According to this ratio, even if the wages are not paid at all, the benefits are less than half of the tax paid. Now the company is entrusting other factories to produce cigarettes. Even if, as it claims, it can reduce the wages of each box by more than ten yuan, it is equal to the difference between the 2.5% tax and the 32.5% tax. Is the difficulty of returning the sick tobacco the same for Chinese manufacturers and foreign manufacturers? If they are treated fairly, the company may not be the only one to suffer. In short, if the company tells the truth to the central competent authorities and earnestly requests a slight reduction in the tax rate or the issuance of bonuses to offset it, and at the same time improves the method of returning sick tobacco, it can maintain the company's business and relieve thousands of unemployed workers. The central government is sympathetic to the unemployed and is anxious about the situation. This is a task that can be done with a little effort, and who knows that it will not be approved. The company must resolutely cause thousands of workers to suddenly become unemployed, what is its intention? The statement that the work of entrusting other factories to produce cigarettes still belongs to domestic workers is especially revealing of its capitalist face. At this time of labor surplus, if the capital side is allowed to take or leave workers at will, and the government does not provide any guarantee or restrictions, then it seems that labor policy and labor movement will be greatly hampered. The company is arbitrarily and recklessly acting. It is in the midst of verification. We received letter No. 271 from the Municipal Civil Training Committee, stating that it had received a secret order No. 8366 from the Central Executive Committee, ordering that the case be handled fairly. If the factory cannot prepare for the opening date in time, it also ordered the Municipal Government to consult and extend the deadline. The first and third of the original measures determined by the bureau should be taken care of in both sides. It seems that the Central Government has already ordered the Municipal Party Department to handle this case fairly, but the principle of the bureau's previous order to consult with the Municipal Party Department and then order the factory to resume operations has not changed. Then, in addition to waiting for the Municipal Government to verify, the bureau seems to be difficult to revoke Instruction No. 2249 to the company. It should be treated in this way. The Municipal Civil Training Committee's letter is attached for your excellency's review and guidance. Sincerely, Municipal Zhang</p>
<h3>Suqian Representatives Come to Shanghai to Beg for Relief</h3>
<p>The Relief Association Will Hold a Meeting to Discuss</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Zhifu, a representative from Suqian seeking relief, arrived in Shanghai yesterday and, together with Mr. Liu Shulun, a respected figure from the county, went to the Jiangsu Temporary Relief Association, the China Jihsheng Association, and the Sino-Foreign Relief Association to seek assistance. According to them, a large number of bandits suddenly entered the southwestern villages of the county this month, burning, killing, and looting along the way, sparing nothing. In dozens of villages such as Caizhuang, Yanwan, Dawangmiao, Sanjietang, and Yewei, thousands of families were devastated, hundreds of people were kidnapped, over a thousand people were killed, and countless houses were burned down. It was an unprecedented catastrophe. The injured and dead were lying on top of each other, a sight too horrible to bear. Those who survived the banditry but escaped were also homeless, exposed to the sun and sleeping in the open, with not a grain of rice to eat, waiting to die with their hands tied. The cries of women and children were unbearable. Mr. Xu further stated that the northeastern villages of the county were also hit by floods, with no harvest of wheat or barley. There were also two thousand starving people. It is reported that the Jiangsu Temporary Relief Association specially invited important figures yesterday to discuss the disaster situation in the county.</p>
<h3>Jihsheng Association Completes Spring Relief in Chuxian</h3>
<p>Report by Xia Fuyi, Director of Relief Operations</p>
<p>The China Jihsheng Association received a letter from Xia Fuyi, Director of Relief Operations in Chuxian, stating that the Chuxian area in northern Anhui has been repeatedly harassed by bandits, and the severe drought last year resulted in no harvest of seeds or grass. The disaster situation is extremely serious, and there are countless starving people. He immediately went to the most severely affected areas in and outside the city and in the northern and southern villages, districts 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8, with friends Ma Jintao, Xia Zexian, Chen Ruilin, Ge Zhongzi, Xiao Xiaochen, Zheng Liangfu, Xia Meiren, Zhang Hongyuan, and Fan Yicheng. A total of 4,554 households were investigated, and a total of 13,213.904 yuan was allocated for relief. According to the disaster situation in Chuxian, this relief effort is only one-tenth or one-twelfth of what is needed. Knowing that it is difficult for the association to raise funds, we dare not ask for more. However, at this time when the harvest is coming, the recipients are all grateful for the great kindness. At this time, disasters are everywhere, and relief is not enough. The relief in Chuxian is just a drop in the bucket, just a decoration. If we talk about universal relief, even Yao and Shun would be sick of it. Thinking about it, we can sigh with the disaster victims.</p>

<h3>Flower Association King Gao A'gen's Wife Dies Tragically</h3>
<p>Returning Home Late at Night After Visiting Her Sick Sister-in-Law</p>
<p>A Thug Darts Out of the Dark Alley</p>
<p>Shot Three Times and Dies Instantly</p>
<p>The Jewelry and Clothing Beside Her Were Not Taken</p>
<p>Gao Zhangshi, wife of Gao A'gen (nicknamed Ma Pi A'gen), a Shaoxing native and flower association king residing at No. 26, Lane 5, Ximen Road, French Concession, was shot dead by an enemy at the corner of Wangzhi Road at 1:03 AM yesterday while returning home after visiting her sick sister-in-law at No. 3, West Lane, Daodeli, Beile Road. The detailed account of the incident is recorded below.</p>
<p>Her husband is the leader of the flower association. The gambling style of the flower association in Shanghai is getting worse day by day. After the two great kings, Liu Lianghong and Zheng Meitang, were assassinated one after another, the successors to Liu and Zheng were Gao A'gen, a Shaoxing native. Although Gao is not yet thirty years old (29), he is quite capable. He now runs Anle Hotel in Taiyuan Lane, East Zilaihuo Street, and has more than a thousand disciples. He lost his father at a young age. His mother, Wang, is 56 years old this year. Gao has married three wives, one living next to the Mali teacher's bathhouse, one living in Zhilan Lane, Kaizier Road, and one living at No. 26, Lane 5, Ximen Road, named Zhangshi Laoqi, who is the same age as Gao.</p>
<p>His wife also lends money. It is said that Zhang has been married to Gao for more than ten years and has two children, a seven-year-old daughter named Zhao and a two-year-old son named Xiaomaotou, who is still in swaddling clothes. Zhang is also capable and handles affairs no less than her husband. She also lends money privately with her savings, so Gao cherishes her the most, and she is very filial to Gao's mother, Wang. Wang used to live at No. 2, Longmen Road, and only moved to No. 3, West Lane, Daodeli, Beile Road, on the sixth day of the ninth lunar month of last year. Gao's brother, Gao A'shun, has a wife and concubine, and also rents houses in the lane at No. 3 and No. 11.</p>
<p>Visiting her sick sister-in-law until midnight. Gao, being bored at home for a long time, suddenly took a boat to Hankou for a tour on the 7th of this month. Before leaving, he specially told Zhang that if there was nothing to do at home, she could go to his mother (Wang) and sister-in-law's place to relax. But only two days after Gao left, Wang suddenly fell ill and her condition became very serious, so Zhang had to visit her every day until late at night before returning. The night before, Zhang finished dinner and went to Daodeli alone, then accompanied her sister-in-law to see a movie at the Nanjing Grand Theater at the intersection of Edward Road, McGillivary Road. After the show, she accompanied Wang back to her residence and chatted until 1:00 AM.</p>
<p>Cars and chartered cars are available. Zhang was chatting with Wang and others when she suddenly heard the clock on the wall strike once and quickly said goodbye to return to her residence. Before leaving, she ordered the Jiangyin chef, Zhang Shenglang, to accompany her home. Gao's family has cars and chartered cars. In the past, she would return to her residence by car or chartered car. But the car was suddenly borrowed by a manager surnamed Zhang from a large company at No. 2, Hezhongli, Caishi Street, a few days ago, and the tires of the chartered car suddenly burst at the same time, so she had to call the chef to accompany her home. The two went out of the lane and walked south, with Shenglang in front and Zhang behind.</p>
<p>Thugs sniper and kill instantly. The two were walking slowly and had reached No. 381, Beile Road, at the entrance of Lane 5. Zhang intended to take a shortcut to the back door of No. 26, because she saw that the alley was unusually dark, she told Shenglang to be careful. Zhang had just taken a step into the alley when a thug in a blue gown suddenly darted out of the darkness and pointed a gun at her back. He fired four or five shots and Zhang was hit by three bullets. One bullet hit her head and pierced through the back of her head, causing her brain to burst out of her forehead and the left corner of her eyebrow. She fell to the ground and died instantly.</p>
<p>The chef was in a panic. Zhang Shenglang, who was accompanying her at the time, suddenly heard a gunshot and saw his mistress fall to the ground. He was immediately frightened and his limbs softened. He squatted on the ground with his hands on his head. The murderer pointed his gun and told him to leave quickly and not look back. Shenglang woke up as if from a dream and ran away madly, shouting for help along the way. But the place was extremely remote and no one came to help. The murderer, seeing that his purpose had been achieved, ran away without a trace. Zhang Shenglang went straight to the Songshan Road police station to report and then returned to report to the master. Gao's brother and sister-in-law heard the news and rushed to the police station. The police had sent detectives to the scene to investigate.</p>
<p>Bad news flew to her husband. The police sent detectives to the scene to investigate in detail. They found several bullet casings next to the body and took them back to the police station to report to the head of the police. They also carried the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for an autopsy. At 3:45 AM, Gao A'shun sent an urgent telegram to Hankou urging the corpse's husband to come to Shanghai overnight to handle the funeral. It is expected that Gao will come to Shanghai by plane after hearing the news. However, it is heard that flights will be suspended on Saturday and Sunday, so there is absolutely no time. The corpse's family will wait until tomorrow afternoon. If Gao still does not arrive in Shanghai, they will take care of the funeral on his behalf.</p>
<p>The corpse has been autopsied. Yesterday morning, the French police criminal department reported to the French Public Hall. Judge Zhu Chengshen arrived at 11:00 AM to examine the corpse. According to the bao tan's report, the corpse's relative, Gao A'shun, the dead woman's brother, arrived to request the arrest of the murderer and to seek justice. According to the witness Zhang Shenglang's testimony, Judge Zhu ruled that Gao Zhangshi died due to gunshot wounds to the head. The corpse's husband, Gao A'shun, prepared a coffin for burial. The police were ordered to arrest the murderer for questioning and to take photos of the corpse for record. The family has received a telegram from the corpse's husband saying that he will return to Shanghai immediately. It is also heard that the deceased was usually kind to others. When the incident occurred, the gold chain, platinum watch, and cash worth about 300 yuan that the deceased was wearing were not lost. According to the circumstances, it seems to be a vendetta.</p>
<p>In the Extortion Case</p>
<h3>The Ripple of Gunfire</h3>
<p>A Policeman on Xiaozha Bridge Scares and Extorts Robbers</p>
<p>Li Zhonghua is Shot and Wounded</p>
<p>A Public Prosecution is Filed for Murder</p>
<p>The Civil Defense Corps Member Also Has Reason</p>
<p>Chen Liangyu's family outside Xiaonanmen received threatening letters in March and April of this year, demanding huge sums of money and specifying the location for handing over the money: on the red wood pavement in front of the Zhengde School on Xiaozha Bridge outside Xiaonanmen, using a newspaper for identification and placing the money on the newspaper. The deadline was 10:00 PM on April 21st. After receiving the letter, Chen secretly reported to the 7th Detachment of the South City Civil Defense Corps, requesting them to send personnel to arrest the perpetrators. When the time came, the detachment leader, Ma Wenda, ordered platoon leader Jin Shunchang to lead corps members Gu Guoan and others to disguise themselves and go to the address to lie in ambush. Before long, Li Zhonghua arrived and placed the newspaper. Seeing this, the corps members rushed up and ordered him to stop. Seeing that Li was about to fire a gun, the corps members fired a shot as a precaution, hitting Li in the stone arm. He was then sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. After he recovered from his injuries, he was thoroughly investigated. It has been reported before that Li Zhonghua, who was injured in this case, felt very unwilling because he had never engaged in any illegal activities and was shot by corps members for no reason. He filed a petition with the local court to verify the injuries and ordered Jin Shunchang and Gu Guoan to be brought to the case. After questioning by Prosecutor Xu Heling, he filed a public prosecution, alleging that Gu Guoan and Jin Shunchang had committed murder under Section 2 of Article 282 of the criminal law. Li Zhonghua's injuries were about to heal and he had been discharged from the hospital. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Wu Zhen specially opened the third courtroom for the trial. The audience was crowded, with most of them being members of various corps. The defendants hired two lawyers, Tang Yingsong and Pan Cheng'e, to appear in court for them. After the judge took the bench, he first summoned Jin Shunchang to the case to testify. Jin Shunchang testified that he was 25 years old, a local, residing at No. 76, Jiangyin Street, and serving as a platoon leader in the 7th Detachment of the Civil Defense Corps. (Question) Did you shoot Li Zhonghua? (Answer) No, it was Gu Guoan who shot him. (Question) Were you together? (Answer) Yes, I was on the left and Gu on the right. (Question) When? (Answer) Around 10:00 PM on April 21st. (Question) How did the shooting happen? (Answer) Because I saw Li Zhonghua raise his right hand, I shot him. (Question) Where? (Answer) In front of Zhengde School. (Question) Was it with a handgun? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Why did you shoot? (Answer) Because I saw a gun-like gesture. (Question) Was there a light there? (Answer) Although there was a light, it was far away. The threatening letter stated that a newspaper would be used for identification. Now I saw Li Zhonghua putting a newspaper on the red wood in front of Zhengde School with a brick on it. His every move matched the threatening letter. I rushed out and ordered him to stop, but he didn't respond and ran away, so Gu Guoan shot him. (Question) Did Li Zhonghua have a handgun? (Answer) No. I saw him raise his hand in a gun-like gesture. When he was injured in his right arm, the object in his hand fell to the ground and turned out to be a money bag rolled up like a gun. (Question) Why didn't you go with the police? (Answer) We were ordered by the detachment leader to go and lie in ambush. The detachment leader sent someone else to notify the police station. After we arrived at the destination, we saw Li Zhonghua coming out of Erwu Lane to urinate on the roadside. (Question) How far was the shooting location from the newspaper placement location? (Answer) About three storefronts. (Question) Did you chase him out? (Answer) Yes, it was official business. Gu Guoan testified that he was 37 years old, a local, residing at No. 19, Santai Wharf, working at Yongxing Foreign Firm and serving as a member of the 7th Detachment of the Civil Defense Corps. (Question) When did the incident happen? (Answer) At 10:00 PM on April 21st on Xiaozha Bridge Street. (Question) Who ordered you? (Answer) I was ordered by Platoon Leader Jin to gather comrades and go to Zhengde School to lie in ambush. At about 10:00 PM, we saw Li Zhonghua walking over, first urinating and then taking out a newspaper. Then he sat on the red wood. So Platoon Leader Jin said to me that this person's actions were the same as in the threatening letter. We quickly prepared ourselves. Unexpectedly, Li Zhonghua heard our voices and immediately got up and ran. I chased him out and ordered him to stop. He turned around and raised his hand in a gun-like gesture. In a hurry, for legitimate self-defense, I had to shoot. (Question) Was his hand still raised when you shot? (Answer) I shot when he raised his hand. (Question) Did the police go? (Answer) No. (Question) Why didn't you cooperate with the police? (Answer) The detachment leader sent someone else to notify. (Question) How far was the place where you shot from the place where the newspaper was placed? (Answer) About two storefronts, etc. Ma Wenda testified that he was 30 years old, a local, working at the Shangnan Long-Distance Bus Company and serving as the leader of the 7th Detachment of the Civil Defense Corps. That night, I sent them to lie in ambush. (Question) Did the police cooperate? (Answer) I sent Corps Member Lin Jinxian to report to Section Chief Jin of the First District, Third Branch. Corps Member Lin was setting up at the destination. When he was about to go to the bureau to report, he heard gunshots and turned back to the scene to assist, etc. Li Zhonghua testified that he was 37 years old, a Zhili native, and a yellow mud worker. That night, I was returning after collecting guild fees and saw a newspaper on the road. I picked it up to wrap copper coins. Unexpectedly, six or seven plainclothes men rushed up and grabbed my hands. (Question) Who did you collect money from? (Answer) From Xu Shuanghui at Cangqiaotou and a used clothes seller named Ji Sheng who borrowed 10 yuan from me. I collected more than 1,000 cash. Also from someone surnamed Wang, Wangji, who lives in Xiaojiuhua. I collected 2 jiao of small money. Also from Shen Fugen. (Question) Why didn't you collect it during the day? (Answer) They are out doing business during the day and go home at night, so I went to collect it at night. (Question) Did you touch this newspaper? (Answer) The newspaper was half on the red wood and half on the ground. I picked it up. (Question) Is this newspaper broken? (Answer) No, I took two or three steps and they rushed up and grabbed me. There were six or seven of them. One grabbed my right hand and one grabbed my left hand and then shot me. (Question) Did you have your money bag? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Did you raise your hand? (Answer) They grabbed both of my hands, how could I raise them? (Question) They said you put the newspaper on the red wood, did you? (Answer) No. (Question) Have you been to the police station? (Answer) Yes, the police station did not accept me. The interrogator asked Jin Shunchang again, "Did you shoot after you grabbed Li?" (Answer) "How could we shoot after we grabbed someone? If we shot, we would definitely hit our comrades." The interrogator asked Gu Guoan again, and Gu's testimony was the same as Jin Shunchang's. Li Wangshi, 36 years old, a Zhili native, testified, "Li Zhonghua is my husband." The interrogator asked, "Do you have anything to say?" She answered, "No." The interrogator ordered her to step down. At this point, the defendant's lawyer, Tang Yingsong, presented a small booklet and a party letter used for printing usurious loans, stating that the booklet was written by Li Zhonghua.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>The interrogator compared the handwriting and found that it was very similar to the handwriting on the threatening letter. After reading it, the interrogator asked Li Zhonghua, "Is this booklet yours?"</p>
<p>(Answer) "No." At this point, lawyer Pan Cheng'e stated that the booklet was indeed used by Li Zhonghua to make usurious loans and requested the court to investigate immediately to clarify the truth. Furthermore, the people who borrowed money could all come to court to testify, etc. The interrogator ordered Li Zhonghua to write down the addresses of the households where he collected money on the night of April 21st. Li replied that his wound had not healed and he could not hold a pen. The interrogator said, "Can you write with your left hand?" Li replied, "I can't write." (Question) "Where did you go first that night?" (Answer) "To Xu Shuanghui's house at No. 15 Xishua Lane, then to Wangji's house in Cangqiao Lane, then to Shen Fugen's house at No. 17 Cangqiao, and Ji Sheng also lives in Cangqiao, I don't know the house number, but after I filed the lawsuit, they all paid me back the money they owed me." The interrogator obtained the testimony and did not open the debate, but waited for further investigation to determine the truth and then scheduled another hearing. The court was then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Inside Story of the Zhang Taijie Case</h3>
<p>Zhang Claims He Was Not Legally Dismissed as the Reason</p>
<p>Suffering the Crime Rather Than Handing Over Evidence</p>
<p>The case of Zhang Taijie, general manager of the Chuanlu Company, being accused by Zeng Xianzhi and others in the local court of embezzling millions of dollars under false pretenses was publicly tried once on the 3rd of this month after being prosecuted by the court. He was not given a final ruling and was told to wait for another summons. It is now learned that the criminal court has scheduled another debate on the 25th of this month. The content of the case is said to be that the Chuanlu Company had already set up an office in Hankou and had already changed hands, while Zhang Taijie had established an office in Shanghai. All the evidence was still in Zhang's hands, so he was sued for embezzling public funds. However, Zhang claimed that he had not been legally dismissed as a reason to resist and pointed out that Zeng Xianzhi and others had no right to sue. Therefore, the court repeatedly ordered him to hand over the evidence, but Zhang would rather suffer the crime than hand it over, it is said.</p>

He then adopted a son named Liugen. However, Wu and his wife were saddened by the deaths of their two sons and soon fell ill and died one after another. Wu's father, Wenhua, was still alive and the grandparents relied on each other for their livelihood. When the orphan grew up, Cao Fuquan, through the persuasion of Xu's adopted brother surnamed Zeng, married into the Wu family with the eldest daughter, Fengquan, and changed his surname to Wu. Soon after, Lin Baochen, following Cao's example and with Shen Guochang, Wenhua's son-in-law, acting as an intermediary, also married into the Wu family with the second daughter, Fuyuan, and changed his surname to Wu. In June of the year before last, Wenhua died of illness. The houses at No. 13, 14, and 15 Hartung Road and the two mu of land on Xishi Road, one mu of land on Mijiaqiao, four fen of land behind the Zhonghua Book Company, and the existing cash and clothing left by Wu Maosheng and his wife were all obtained by the two uxorilocal husbands. Wu's third, fourth, and fifth daughters, Lindingen, Fudi, and Linfudi, did not receive any share. The three daughters, because they were often oppressed by Cao Fuquan and Lin Baochen through their elder sisters, and because they were weak and lonely and afraid of living and cooking together, had no choice but to avoid their edge and temporarily reside at No. 17, Meiren Lane, Beidi Alley, French Concession. They hired lawyers Jiang Baoli and Baolian to file a lawsuit against Cao Fuquan, Lin Baochen, and the elder sisters, Wu Fengquan and Wu Fuyuan, for the division of the inheritance, requesting that the land, houses, existing cash, clothing, and various properties be divided into six shares, so that the five sisters and Liugen each receive one share. Yesterday morning, Judge Chuan Daren of the Special District Local Court summoned the plaintiffs Wu Lindi and the other two, but they did not arrive. Lawyer Jiang stated the reasons for the lawsuit. According to the defendant Lin Baochen, he did not know about the four fen of land, and the one mu of land had been sold by his grandfather during his lifetime. The two mu of land had also been mortgaged to others by his grandfather. His grandfather had a will stating that the property should be divided among them and that Lindingen and the other three should be given 500 yuan each for their dowries when they married, etc. Cao's testimony mostly stated that he did not know. The defendant's lawyer then presented a photo of the will. Lawyer Jiang stated that the format of the will was different from other wills and requested that the defendant present the original. The defendant's lawyer stated that the original was kept at Shen Guochang's place. Judge Zhou questioned Fengquan and Fuyuan and ordered them to be summoned again to supplement their testimony and ordered the plaintiffs to be present on July 2nd at 8:00 AM to continue the hearing.</p>
<h3>Tobacco Dealers Promote Chinese Tobacco</h3>
<p>Recent Situation of British and American Tobacco Price Increases</p>
<p>The Shanghai tobacco exchange industry has been affected by foreign exchange rates, and the cost of cigarette raw materials has increased repeatedly.

After receiving the letter, the association first printed a temporary door-to-door price list, which has been distributed to various road dealers yesterday. It is heard that Qiu Tanglin, Chai Yasheng, Tang Shixiang, Ye Yinfang, and Shen Ruifang are responsible for the distribution in the South City. A draft declaration promoting domestic cigarettes will also be published in the newspaper.</p>

<p>First District Party Headquarters Petitions Higher Authorities for Investigation</p>
<p>An incident of military and police mutual assault occurred in Minhang Town, the First District of Shanghai County, on the afternoon of the 13th. The situation was quickly quelled, but at around 9 p.m. that evening, soldiers from the water police detachment stationed in Minhang went to the Public Security Bureau and destroyed the doors, windows, lights, and equipment, and assaulted six police officers, two of whom were seriously injured. Residents were terrified and closed their doors. After the incident, the First District Party Headquarters and other organizations investigated the situation and reported it to the County Restructuring Committee, requesting that it be forwarded to higher authorities for strict investigation.

<p>Petition regarding the mutual assault of military and police stationed in Minhang, the destruction of the Public Security Bureau, and the assault on police officers. Requesting that it be forwarded to the Provincial Restructuring Committee and then to the Provincial Government for strict investigation and handling to uphold military discipline. It is reported that at approximately 9 p.m. on the 13th of this month, numerous members of the public reported to the headquarters that soldiers from the water police detachment were in conflict with the Public Security Bureau, and that a large number of soldiers were attacking the Public Security Bureau. Local people were greatly alarmed, fearing that it would lead to a major disaster and harm local security, requesting that they intervene to mediate and maintain local order. Based on this, a letter was immediately sent to the security corps requesting that they maintain local order. At the same time, the district chief of the First District, Wu Jingqing, the chairman of the chamber of commerce, Chen Lujun, and others went to persuade them. At that time, the soldiers of the water police detachment had already returned to their unit, so they immediately investigated the truth and learned that a few police officers had a disagreement with the water police officers in the city that day and had a mutual assault. At around 9 p.m., a number of water police officers suddenly rushed to the Public Security Bureau with sticks, bamboo canes, and wooden blocks. As soon as they arrived at the door, they beat the guard Shen Yizhi and stormed into the gate, demolishing the lights and glass windows of the surrounding duty room and the patrol leader's office, and brutally beat the police officers, causing the third-class patrol officer Liang Ligong to be injured in the head and Long Shengquan to be injured in the abdomen. At the same time, the guard Lang Yihu was beaten in the head near the Huangpu Beach Minnan Shipping Bureau, and patrol leader Yang Lecheng was also beaten while patrolling the city, but was fortunately not injured. Third-class patrol officer Liu Guiyan was also beaten and injured in the head on his way back to the bureau from the bathroom. In total, six police officers were injured, with the injuries of Liu and Lang being the most serious. The police officers were carried by the Public Security Bureau to the Minhang Police Hospital for treatment. It is believed that both the water and land police have the duty to protect the peace and the people, and should cooperate to maintain local order. Unexpectedly, they violated the law and discipline and engaged in self-defeating assaults, causing panic and unease among the residents. At this time of unrest and martial law in Shanghai, they disregarded local security. Although security is now temporarily maintained by security corps personnel, such excessive actions should be thoroughly investigated in order to uphold military discipline and deter illegal activities. Therefore, a special document is prepared and submitted to your committee for review and forwarding to the Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee and then to the Provincial Government for investigation of the truth and strict investigation in order to show punishment and uphold military discipline.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Bureau Reorganizes City's Power Plants</h3>
<p>Preliminary Plan Completed</p>
<p>Baoming Plant to Receive Power from Zhabei</p>
<p>The Wusong Baoming Electric Company supplies electricity to Wusong Town and the surrounding areas of Baoshan County. Its equipment capacity is extremely small. In addition to an old steam generator that has long been out of use, the two diesel generators currently in use have a total capacity of only about 230 kilowatts. Recently, electricity consumption has gradually increased, and the peak load has reached about 200 kilowatts, which is almost insufficient. Therefore, it is planned to expand the equipment to meet the needs. The Public Utilities Bureau, in view of the fact that small power plants generate their own electricity, which is not as economical as purchasing electricity from large power plants for resale, and that the new power plant of Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, the Jiangsong Bridge, is about to be completed and is very close to the company, making it very convenient to connect power lines, ordered the company to stop expanding and follow the example of Xianghua, Zhiru, Pudong, and other companies to purchase electricity from Zhabei Huashang two companies. It is reported that the conditions for consultation between the two parties have been agreed upon, and a contract will be signed and implemented soon. The preliminary plan of the Public Utilities Bureau to unify the city's power plants can be said to be completed.</p>

<p>Two Copper Coins Lose a Rice Bowl</p>
<p>The Road Transportation Office previously received a letter from passenger Ma Youxian stating that on June 7th, he traveled from Shanghai to Jiangwan and there were discrepancies in the ticket prices between Shanghai Station and Jiangwan Station.

<h3>Meat Industry Strike in Pudong Unresolved</h3>
<p>Meat merchants in areas such as Lan Ni Du and Lao Bai Duqiao in Pudong have repeatedly requested the establishment of a slaughterhouse in Yangjiadu, a central location, because it is too far and inconvenient to travel to Yangjing Slaughterhouse, and the Bureau of Health ordered slaughtering in Tangqiao, but the Tangqiao slaughterhouse has not yet been established and there are various inconveniences. Veterinary doctors wanted to save themselves the trouble of running around and did not stamp the meat, resulting in a suspension of business for more than forty days and huge losses.

The time is from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on the 29th (Sunday), and each person will be issued a certificate with a photo of themselves attached. The salary will be paid upon signing. After learning of this, all the workers of the Junpu Branches in Wusong and Zhanghuabang unanimously agreed that the revised salary payment method was not only cumbersome in terms of procedures, but also inconvenient due to the need to travel back and forth. The workers believed that Sunday was a regular day off and that this method was exploiting their interests, so they unanimously decided to oppose it and continue to follow the old rules. They submitted a request to Bureau Chief Song Ziliang, asking him to withdraw the order to show compassion. At the same time, they sent representatives to Shanghai yesterday to petition Director Song.</p>

After our marriage, we first lived in Wuhu. On April 18th, the defendant returned to her mother's home. She did not return until August. In October, her mother came to take her away, but I did not know where she went. I later learned that she was in Anqing. I went to visit her, but she said that she had a job and would return home in about two weeks. I waited until December but did not see her come. I went to look for her again but could not find her. Later, I received a letter from her from the Art University, but she noted in the letter that she would be going to Japan to study after sending the letter. I sent a letter to Japan scolding her for running away privately, but her reply was not concrete. Furthermore, she spent money arbitrarily, so I am requesting a divorce." The court ordered a postponement for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Dispute After Maid Ran Away</h3>
<p>The Broker Says She Was Sold</p>
<p>A Loud Demand for the Maid</p>
<p>Zhao Zicheng, a 41-year-old from Guizhou Province, residing at No. 32, Yong'an Lane, Lujiazai, Pudong, worked in the printing department of the British-American Tobacco Company in Lujiazui. Last month, his wife became ill and there was no one to take care of her. He wanted to hire a maid to take care of the patient. Chen Pinshan, a Ningbo native living at No. 42, Wufu Lane, nearby, learned about it and told Zhao that he had a woman who was willing to be introduced as a maid. Zhao agreed. On the 19th of last month, Chen brought the woman, named Lin Wang, to Zhao's house. She was from Ningbo and a middle-aged woman. After working as a maid in Zhao's house for only four days, she ran away with four sets of Zhao's single-layer clothes. Zhao negotiated with the broker, Chen Pinshan, to claim compensation for the loss, but failed. He had to shout and complain endlessly. Unexpectedly, a month later, Wang Jialu, who claimed to be Wang's elder brother, suddenly arrived at Zhao's house with the original recommender Chen Pinshan and more than ten strong men to demand the maid. Zhao was greatly frightened and secretly reported to the fourth team of the police, who sent police to the scene and arrested Wang, Chen, and another person named Ren Xinfa, and brought them to the team first. According to the plaintiff's statement, Wang Jialu claimed to be a 33-year-old Ningbo native residing at No. 66, Fuhui Lane, Hujia Wood Bridge, Pudong. He was a bamboo craftsman. He said that his younger sister was sold to Zhao, so he was demanding her. He had no other demands. Chen Pinshan admitted that he was the original recommender. Ren Xinfa said that Jialu's sister lived in his house for two days before Chen Pinshan recommended her to Zhao's house to work as a maid. Captain Zhu believed that these people were like releasing white pigeons, so he transferred the four defendants to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation through the third district.</p>
<h3>Collision Between Cargo Ship and Rice Boat</h3>
<p>The rice boat Zhou Baosheng, a native of Wu Jiang, recently loaded 170 stones of white rice to ship to Shanghai and entrusted a rice merchant to sell it, who dispatched a friend to escort it to Shanghai. The incident occurred the afternoon before yesterday, when the boat was sailing near the Huangpu River in Maohe. The sky was getting dark and the boat wanted to stop for the night and continue to Shanghai the next day. However, the friend who was escorting the boat said that the principal had informed him to rush to Shanghai, and the rice merchant had sent a letter reporting that the prices in Shanghai had risen and that there was little stock in the market, and asked him to quickly load the goods onto the Shanghai market for sale, where he could make a large profit. Therefore, he asked Zhou not to stop. Zhou said that there were many northeastern bends in the Maohe River, and it was especially dangerous to travel at night, so he refused to travel. The friend insisted that Zhou travel no matter what, and rush to Minhang to dock so that he could take a long-distance bus to Shanghai to inform the rice merchant so that he could sample the goods to various firms the next morning. Zhou, seeing that the friend was forcing him, had to travel as usual. Unexpectedly, when he was sailing near Desheng, a Songjiang cargo ship sailing from Shanghai suddenly came sailing with the wind at a rapid pace. The two ships collided violently, with the cargo ship being unable to avoid it. Zhou's boat was small and heavily loaded, so the bow of the boat was broken and the tide flowed in. The crew member Liu Sheng, who was steering the boat, was knocked into the water. Zhou saw that the boat was about to sink and called for help. The cargo ship then lowered its sail and returned to rescue him, trying to drag Zhou's boat to the beach and drop it off. The cargo ship also lowered a small sampan to salvage Zhou's crew member Liu Sheng, but it was difficult to find him at night. After two or three hours of salvaging, he was still not found. Yesterday, Zhou came to Shanghai to report to the rice merchant, who hired a boat to unload the rice so that he could sell the wet rice to the sugar factory. However, the rice in the front cabin was completely soaked away, and the remaining rice in the middle cabin was also wet. The cargo ship has now been detained for negotiation and compensation for losses, and the search for Liu Sheng's corpse is still in progress. It is said that both sides have their own reasons, and it is unknown how it will be resolved.</p>
<h3>Flour Boat Capsizes Due to Tidal Surge</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 1:00 a.m., the Shanghai Qingrui Customs Brokerage hired a wharf boat owned by Chen Alin to transport 300 bags of flour and 500 bags of bran in the Suzhou Creek to sail out. At that time, there was a high tide, so the boat sailed south along the Puxi side. When it reached the vicinity of the Yangjingbang River, it planned to detour to Pudong to unload the goods. When it reached the center of the river, the stern of a British warship was affected by the rapid tidal surge, causing it to temporarily lose its autonomy, and it crashed into the warship's stern. The warship's hull was strong and unharmed, but the boat was capsized by the impact, and the cargo was completely lost. At the same time, a sampan at the rear of the warship was also sunk. Fortunately, there were no casualties. It is said that the losses were huge, but the cargo was insured with the Baolong Insurance Company and had a considerable amount of water insurance.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ship Crushes Five Boats</h3>
<p>Losses Estimated at 1,000 Gold</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 7:00 a.m., the Nissin Company's Meikou Maru Japanese ship was sailing into the port and was about to dock at the company's wharf in Zhangjiabang, Pudong. The helmsman was careless, causing the ship's stern to simultaneously crush five empty wharf boats that were docked at the wharf. The first boat had its stern corner and sluice gate damaged, with losses estimated at 50 yuan. The second boat had its stern corner, sluice gate, and railing damaged, with losses estimated at 500 yuan. The third boat had its rear railing damaged, with losses estimated at 30 yuan.

The police then arrested Zhou Zihe, an employee of the company and a native of Shaoxing, and allowed him to post bail while awaiting trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Ge Zhitan of the Special District Local Court opened a trial to summon the Ningfeng Company, which sent lawyer Wang Fuchang to the court to request that the case be handled according to law, and also filed a civil lawsuit ordering the return of the original goods or compensation for the price of 3,600 yuan. The company's manager, Zhou Xiangyu, testified that the defendant Zhou Zihe received the stolen goods and could not be allowed to evade his responsibility. According to Zhu Wenxian's confession, he was a foreign goods broker. Zhang came to him with a sample of artificial silk and asked him to sell it. Zhang said that he had bought it at an auction. He then approached Luo, the manager of the Dachang Customs Brokerage, and offered it for 140 yuan per case. Zhou Zihe was also present during the conversation. According to Zhou Zihe's testimony, he worked at Dachang and the goods were purchased by the former manager Luo, which had nothing to do with him. Luo had left Shanghai and Dachang had been transferred to Yan. He also hired lawyer Ye Fokang to defend him. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Zhou sentenced Zhu Wenxian to a fine of 500 yuan. If he was unable to pay, he would be allowed to offset the fine with imprisonment at a rate of 2 yuan per day. Zhou Zihe was found not guilty. The civil lawsuit should be transferred to the civil court for trial. Zhou remained on bail, while Zhu posted 4,100 yuan in bail.</p>
<h3>Man Rescued After Jumping into River</h3>
<p>At around 6:00 p.m. the night before last, a middle-aged man in a very disheveled state hired a rowing boat at the Company Wharf in the French Concession, claiming that he wanted to cross the river to Pudong. However, shortly after leaving the wharf, the man suddenly threw a packet of medicine and a paper that looked like a suicide note into the cabin, and then jumped into the Huangpu River from the bow of the boat to commit suicide. Fortunately, a water patrol officer from No. 15 nearby saw him and rushed over to help the boatman rescue him from the water. As it was late, his life was temporarily saved. The officer took him to the water patrol station for interrogation. He said that his name was Zhu Sanzi, 31 years old, from Gaoyou. He rented a shop at No. 6, Zhen'an Lane, Huanghe Road, behind the cattle slaughtering company in the French Concession. The nightly accommodation fee was only 120 copper coins, which was even cheaper than a small inn. He relied on collecting waste paper to make a living. Due to a serious illness for more than a month, he had spent all his money, and his wife had also run away. He was also in debt for a lot of rent, so he did not want to prolong his life in this world. The contents of his suicide note were full of misspellings and were quite laughable. Here are a few sentences excerpted below: (Da Guozi's boss lady treated me badly, always robbed me, Ziqing treated me badly, and the second landlord treated me very well, Liu Jinrong, please inquire and seek justice for me, etc.). The police officers, seeing his pitiful state, generously gave him some living expenses and ordered the detectives to send him ashore to leave.</p>
<h3>Penalties for Not Affixing Revenue Stamps</h3>
<p>Yingchunfang Yuebinlou Restaurant, Tiema Road, Lao Yongxiang Silk and Cloth Store, and Zhenghesheng Xiji Wine Shop on North Henan Road, etc., were accused by the Public Works Bureau's lawyers of not affixing revenue stamps on their invoices. Jin Di in Fuyu Lane, Le Fengjun in Xin'an, Hong Juan in Qunyu Lane, Li Qing on Shantou Road, etc., were accused of not affixing revenue stamps on their bureau tickets. The Special District Local Court held a joint hearing before Judge Luo Renji yesterday (the 14th) at 9:00 AM. According to the prostitute Jin Di and others, they claimed that they did not know that bureau tickets required revenue stamps and that it was a genuine mistake. Judge Luo ruled that the three shops, Yuebinlou, etc., be fined 30 yuan each for not affixing revenue stamps on their invoices. Jin Di and the others were exempt from punishment, but were still instructed to ensure that customers affix revenue stamps before issuing bureau tickets on their behalf and not to violate the rules in the future.</p>
<h3>Worker Dies of Heart Failure</h3>
<p>At 7:00 PM the other day, a person resembling a worker collapsed near No. 2034 North Suzhou Road. A Chinese patrolman discovered him and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, the man had heart failure and his recovery was unlikely. He soon died, and the hospital reported it to the police station. A Chinese detective was sent to investigate and the body was taken to the Féron Road mortuary. Yesterday, the Special District Local Court appointed Prosecutor Guo to examine the body. The western police chief stated that no family members of the deceased had come forward and requested that the body be handed over to the Pushan Cemetery for burial. Mr. Guo then ruled that the deceased had indeed died of illness and that the body should be handed over to the Pushan Cemetery for burial.</p>
<h3>Lost Unnamed Girl Waiting to Be Claimed</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau reported yesterday that the First Station of the Second District sent over an unnamed lost girl who was found on Jiucang Street. When asked about her name, age, birthplace, and family situation, she was unable to answer. The child is approximately four or five years old, with a fair, round face, short hair, wearing a white twill cloth jacket, red striped cloth pants, purple thread socks, and embroidered satin shoes. The child is temporarily being cared for at the Xinbing Nursery awaiting to be claimed.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I am writing in response to the news item in your newspaper on the 14th of this month regarding the dispute over the shortage of rice in a rice store. Our business has always been based on integrity and we have never intentionally shorted anyone's weight. The transaction with Chunyuan Pig Store was a misunderstanding due to an accident on the road involving the deliveryman. The two parties have already reached an understanding and are conducting business as usual. This matter concerns the reputation of our small business. We hereby request a correction. Sincerely, Tong Dexiang Rice Store, South City, June 14th.</p>

<h3>Preliminary Free Education Measures</h3>
<p>Submitted to the Provincial Government for Approval</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Education Department submitted a document to the Provincial Government stating that it was for drafting preliminary temporary measures for compulsory education to be reviewed and approved. It secretly investigated that the Second National Education Conference decided on a compulsory education plan, which stated that the organization for training teachers across the country should be completed within five years, and at the same time, 1,500 experimental areas for compulsory education should be established in cities and villages so that all important counties in the country can start small-scale experiments, and then gradually promote to the end of the twentieth year to implement four years of compulsory education across the country, etc. The original plan is very detailed in terms of teacher training, increasing classrooms, and budget for funds. The department carefully considered that the total number of out-of-school children in the province currently accounts for about 80% or more. Although small-scale compulsory education experimental areas may be gradually realized, it is not easy to establish them due to a lack of teachers and funds. Moreover, the number of children outside the experimental areas is more than double. If we must wait until the whole country implements four years of compulsory education uniformly after 20 years, the loss of all knowledge in the 20 years will be irreplaceable. It is planned to refer to the United States and Japan to implement compulsory education for two hours of instruction per day, and to first try out preliminary compulsory education for two hours of instruction per day. After three years, it will be the end of the compulsory education period, and then the length of study will be gradually increased. By the end of the twentieth year, the implementation of four years of compulsory education will make the age of this school equal to that of the four-year formal primary school. Since it does not violate the laws and regulations, it is easier to handle. The department had previously raised this opinion when opening the Second Compulsory Education Committee, and it was unanimously approved after discussion. Now, based on this intention, a temporary measure is drafted as in Yu Tiao. Is it appropriate to combine the original proposal and method into a document and submit it for review and instruction? Respectfully presented to the Jiangsu Provincial Government Committee Chairman, Ye Ji, presented one copy of the proposal and method. Chen Hexian, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department.</p>
<p>Temporary Measures for the Trial Implementation of Preliminary Compulsory Education in Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>(1) For the purpose of trying out preliminary compulsory education, each county shall divide areas with dense populations and conduct pilot projects first. (2) After the pilot area is designated as described in the preceding paragraph, the Education Department shall investigate children of compulsory school age and submit an annual plan for establishing schools and adding grades, along with a budget, to the county government for submission to the Education Department for approval. (3) Schools that conduct pilot preliminary compulsory education as described in the preceding paragraph shall be temporarily named Simple Primary Schools. (4) Simple Primary Schools shall enroll children around the age of ten who cannot enter formal primary schools. (5) The main subjects of Simple Primary Schools shall be the four types of Party Ideology, Chinese Language, Arithmetic, and Common Sense. (6) Simple Primary Schools shall provide two hours of instruction per grade per day, totaling 500 hours per year (30,000 minutes). (7) Children who enter Simple Primary Schools shall be deemed to have completed compulsory education if they can complete 1,500 hours (90,000 minutes). (8) The number of children in each grade in Simple Primary Schools shall be 50 as a standard. (9) Each teacher in Simple Primary Schools shall be responsible for three grades in principle. (10) Classrooms in Simple Primary Schools shall adopt the tiered system. (11) School buildings in Simple Primary Schools shall utilize temples, ancestral halls, and all public places. (12) For children in the pilot area, the Education Bureau shall notify the children's parents to promote enrollment before the start of the school year in conjunction with the Public Security Bureau. (13) If the parents of children who receive the notice described in the preceding paragraph still fail to comply by the start of the school year, the school shall notify the Public Security Bureau to go to the head of the district to persuade them. (14) Those who are persuaded but still do not enroll shall be reported by the Education Bureau to the county magistrate for strict admonishment and compulsory enrollment of the parents. (15) These measures shall be decided and promulgated by the Jiangsu Provincial Government Committee for implementation and reported to the Ministry of Education for record.</p>
<h3>Attention College Applicants</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently published statistics on universities that have been approved for establishment and those that have been ordered to close, so that college applicants during the summer vacation can choose wisely and avoid making mistakes. The following is a record of the Ministry of Education's announcement:</p>
<p>It is noted that Article 28 of the Regulations for Private Schools stipulates that (Students and graduates of private schools that have not been approved for establishment in accordance with these regulations shall not receive the same treatment as students of schools that have been established). Whether a school is established is of great importance to the personal interests of students, especially in universities. Students should choose schools carefully. Last year, the Ministry issued a cordial announcement in May. Recently, it has been found that students from unestablished schools who have not graduated often have no way to transfer schools and drop out midway. Those who have graduated are often rejected due to their illegal graduation qualifications regarding civil servant examinations, lawyer qualifications, doctor's business licenses, etc., and often regret it. As the summer vacation is approaching, the list of private universities and colleges that have been approved for establishment and those that have been ordered to close is published for public knowledge. Students should carefully consider when applying and should not make mistakes. This is hereby announced. The private universities and colleges that have been approved for establishment are as follows: (Xiamen) Xiamen University (Nanjing) Jinling University (Shanghai) Datong University, Fudan University, Hujiang University, Guanghua University, Daxia University, Shanghai College of Political Science and Law, China Public School (Beijing) Yenching University, Peking Union Medical College (Tianjin) Nankai University (Suzhou) Soochow University (Wuchang) Wuchang Zhonghua University. The private universities and colleges that have been ordered to close are as follows: (Shanghai) East Asia University, Huaguo University, Guangming University, Construction University, Xinmin University, Shanghai College of Literature and Law, Shanghai Art University, China Art University, Qunzhi University.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Inspects Nantong University</h3>
<p>The board of directors of the private Nantong University has submitted an application for establishment, which has been approved by the Ministry of Education. However, whether the school can be established must be determined after an assessment. The Ministry of Education has recently hired Wang Shanjian, Dean of the College of Agriculture of Central University, Chen Qingtang, Professor of Zhejiang University, and Jin Baoshan, Member of the Medical Education Committee of the Ministry of Education, to go to inspect the private Nantong University together with Shen Qingchi, an employee of the Ministry. They are expected to leave soon.</p>
<h3>Details of the Fire at Nanzhong</h3>
<p>At about 8:00 PM the other night, a fire broke out in the dormitory of the Second Branch of Nanjing Middle School in Bafutang due to a short circuit in an electric light. The flames blazed immediately and were impossible to approach. Principal Zhang and all the faculty and staff of the school immediately arrived at the scene to maintain order and telegraphed the Fourth Precinct of the Fourth Police Bureau to report the incident. Fire brigades from various roads quickly arrived to put out the fire. More than 200 students were in self-study time and were not caught off guard. Faculty, staff, and students from the First Branch also rushed to participate in the firefighting efforts. Fortunately, the rescue was swift and only 16 bungalows were destroyed. After about an hour, order was completely restored. Principal Zhang convened an emergency school affairs meeting that night and formulated specific follow-up measures. Classes resumed as usual the next day.</p>
<h3>Wuhan University Establishes Science Lecture</h3>
<p>The China Education and Culture Fund Board of Directors believes that the management of National Wuhan University is still relatively complete. Last year, three lectures in physics, chemistry, and botany were set up at the school, respectively, by Professors Pan Zuwu, Wang Xinggong, and Ye Yage. The Cultural Fund has again sent a letter to the school asking it to add a biological lecture from August of this year. The professor's salary and equipment will be provided by the association. After receiving the letter, Principal Wang Shijie of Wuhan University has agreed to have Professor He Dingjie of Zoology in charge. It is heard that Dr. He's resume has been sent to the Cultural Fund for review and hiring.</p>
<h3>Director Cheng of the Anhui Provincial Education Department Inspects in Bengbu</h3>

Yesterday, there was also a telegram to Secretary Wang saying that he had gone to Bengbu to inspect the site of the rural normal school and would return to the province on the 14th and 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Recent News from Zhoupu School in Nanhui</h3>
<p>Since Mr. Sheng Jianhong became the principal of Zhoupu Primary School in Nanhui County, he has participated in various grand competitions for primary and secondary schools in the county. He won the first prize in the school administration competition last summer and in the Chang exhibition last month. Last week, in the county-wide Mandarin speech competition, it was heard that Gu Longgen, a student from the school, won first place, and Ma Jintao won fourth place.

<h3>Ministry of Education Commends Shanghai Municipal Joint Examination</h3>
<p>Method Slightly Revised</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Education Bureau, in order to be prudent in the graduation examination, sent personnel to supervise the high school graduation examination during this session and held a joint examination for junior high school and primary school. It had reported this supervision and joint examination method to the Ministry of Education. Yesterday, the Ministry of Education instructed the bureau, saying that all the documents submitted were known. The bureau intended to stipulate supervision and joint examination methods for primary and secondary schools in the urban area to examine students' graduation achievements, which was very intentional. However, after reviewing the various methods, there were still some places that needed to be revised. (1) In addition to the three subjects of Chinese, English, and Mathematics, all three subjects of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology should be supervised in the graduation examination of ordinary high schools to show attention to natural science and avoid neglecting it as always. (2) The subjects supervised in the graduation examination of vocational schools (including sports schools) should be the subjects they specialize in. (3) The percentage of importance of natural science in the joint examination subjects of junior high schools seems to be too light. The percentage of importance of each subject is tentatively set as follows:</p>
<p>比Four four eight nine nine ○ six ○</p>
<p>分 Two one Two one ○</p>
<p>百</p>
<p>目 Right text language history science science however</p>
<p>科 Party Country English Calendar Land Calculation From Together</p>
<p>(4) The primary school joint examination is limited to senior primary school graduates who have completed six years of study. The examination method should adopt more measurement-style tests. (5) Private primary and secondary schools that have not been established may be allowed to participate in the joint examination of this session, but at the same time, each school should be urged to register in accordance with the regulations, otherwise graduates of the next session will not be allowed to participate in the joint examination. The above points should be followed and corrected. This order is on file.</p>
<p>Junior High School</p>

<h3>The Opening of a National Defense Chemistry Specialty at Fudan University</h3>
<p>Considered to Easily Breed Abuses</p>
<p>Shanghai's Fudan University has always been enthusiastic about promoting science. The establishment of the Psychology Institute has become famous overseas, opening a new era in the history of education in our country. Now, because the great powers are all preparing for poison gas warfare, military chemical research is becoming increasingly sophisticated, and the use of poisonous weapons is increasing endlessly. Drawing from the successful models of Europe and America, and responding to domestic needs, the university has planned a summer national defense chemistry specialty program. Experienced scholars will be hired to teach, with the aim of solidifying border defenses, resisting maritime insults, and creating talent for self-defense to prepare for external threats. The university has put much effort into this. Since various newspapers in Shanghai, Guangdong, and Tianjin disclosed this news, it has attracted the attention of various sectors at home and abroad. Over a hundred letters have been sent to the university expressing fervent sympathy and admiration. Dozens of people have also expressed their willingness to study this science. The university is deeply grateful for the support from all sides and has thus become more determined. In addition to reporting to the ministry for record, it is also actively preparing with all its might, purchasing various instruments and equipment from abroad, which have been successively transported to the university for use when the time comes. Recently, the Municipal Education Bureau issued an order stating that it had received an order from the Ministry of Education stating that the establishment of a national defense chemistry specialty would easily breed abuses and should be canceled immediately. The university, suffering this unexpected blow, had no choice but to temporarily suspend the enthusiastically prepared and painstaking summer national defense chemistry specialty program due to the Ministry's authoritative order.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at nine o'clock, the East Asia Physical Education School, located on Lutang Street, Caotang Street, Lujiawan in this city, held a completion ceremony for its new school building and a graduation ceremony for the 20th graduating class of the undergraduate program.

After Chairman Chen Mengyu finished his report, Director Chen delivered a speech, strongly criticizing the common problems committed by various schools and those engaged in physical education, pointing out the proper path and placing the responsibility of wiping away the national humiliation of the Far Eastern Games on the graduating students. His words were earnest and forthright. Next, Mr. Wu Bokang, representative of the Municipal Party Department, delivered a speech, mainly saying that there were a hundred things to be done in Chinese sports, just like barren land waiting to be cultivated. He hoped that the graduating students would embrace the spirit of sacrifice and go to cultivate it. Then, school board director Zhang Zhijiang delivered a speech, recounting what he had learned and felt from visiting the Far Eastern Games in Japan, to encourage the graduating students to strive to promote sports, especially paying attention to national martial arts and long-distance running, to achieve good results in the next Games. After the performance speeches, Director Chen issued graduation certificates, and school board director Zhang issued award flags to Mr. Deng Zhiming. Mr. Deng participated in the National Games and won the 800-meter championship with a record performance, so the school principal awarded him a flag in recognition.

<h3>Research on the Failure of the Chinese Basketball Team</h3>
<p>(Xu Minhui)</p>
<p>Exposing the Weaknesses of the Entire Team</p>
<p>Detailed Discussion of Japanese and Philippine Tactics</p>
<p>丨I hope that all members of the Chinese team and those who practice basketball will read it carefully丨</p>
<p>The Chinese basketball team that attended the 9th Far Eastern Games was based on the Nankai Five Tigers. They had long been famous throughout the country and had once defeated the famous Philippine team. With the addition of the Three Heroes of Peiping, Shangmei, and the Tianjin duo of Lu and Yao, all Chinese people believed that this Far Eastern championship would surely be secured. Unexpectedly, they lost to Japan first and then to the Philippines, losing all four games in a row, which was truly a complete defeat. This was beyond our expectations and opened up an unprecedented humiliation for our basketball team since the Far Eastern Games began. Although the reasons for the failure are very complex, I would like to offer my humble opinions to the gentlemen who are familiar with basketball, and I also hope that the team members and leaders will correct what they have and encourage what they do not have. I will discuss it separately below.</p>
<p>(A) Forwards</p>
<p>Center Liu Jianchang is good at jumping, and he often gets the ball during the jump ball. However, he often shoots the ball to one place, which is noticed by the enemy, so the ball often falls into the hands of the enemy. Liu was originally a fierce general, but unfortunately, his ball skills are sometimes intentional and sometimes unintentional. Sometimes he can be wonderfully creative, and sometimes he is completely uninspired. In the four consecutive battles, he never showed his magic. The problem is that after jumping the ball, he retreats to a conservative position. His advancement is slow. Sometimes he gets stimulants from the instructor or teammates, and his ball skills are quite impressive, but soon he returns to the same old way.</p>
<p>Right forward Tang Baokun is lively and agile, which is recognized by everyone. However, he is accustomed to dribbling the ball to the bottom of the basket and then shooting. The Japanese and Filipinos know this person's skills well and have already sent people to monitor him, so there is no way to use it. The teammates are also watched by others, so they have no choice but to use long-range shooting, but he rarely practices long-range shooting on weekdays, so most of them do not hit. The instructor and teammates all think that he is deliberately showing off, so they complain and blame him, but Tang thinks that in this situation, there is no possibility of passing the ball, and the enemy team is firmly guarding the city, so there is no other way but to shoot from a distance, so each insists on his own opinion, and the coordination work goes wrong, and the team spirit is also affected. Although Tang cannot be exempted from criticism, in fact, the poor training methods have contributed to this. Tang's attitude towards sportsmanship has always been critical. Only in the second game with Japan, he used conspiracies to injure people two or three times, regardless of the ball. Although this was caused by the Japanese referees repeatedly penalizing the ball for no reason, it is still regrettable that there are shortcomings in his personality.</p>
<p>Left forward Yao Enhan is good at shooting from the bottom of the basket, but this time the Japanese are strictly monitoring him and cannot get close, and his body is very short, and he also knows that his long-range shooting is not accurate, so there are few opportunities to score, and he often passes the ball back, which is also out of necessity.</p>
<p>Left forward Wei Pengyun was originally a substitute and participated in very few games. In the second game with Japan, he was angry with the referee's unfairness. When the ball went out of bounds, he got the ball and threw it at the examiner's face. The first time he avoided it, but soon the first time, he took advantage of his unpreparedness and threw it again, hitting his chest. The examiner wanted to reason with him, and the viewers kicked him in the feet, but he didn't know who did it. Fortunately, the game was over, otherwise, there might have been a dispute. Everyone was angry with the referee's unfairness. If a team member has such actions, it is a great loss to his personality as a representative of our dignified China.</p>
<h3>(B) Guards</h3>
<p>Our team's guards focus on defending within fifteen feet of the basket. However, most of the Filipino and Japanese shots are between twenty and thirty feet, and our team uses a five-man zone defense. The three forwards are about on the center line. The Filipinos and Japanese forwards break through our first line of defense and immediately use long-range shots, and many of them hit. Therefore, our guards have to go out to grab it, and the basket is empty, and the enemy has a chance to take advantage of it, so the guards have difficulty advancing and retreating, and the formation is greatly disrupted. Even with Li Guochen and Liu Guanjun, they cannot defend against it. If Lu Zhongen is replaced, he is good at cutting into the front, and he has made many achievements, but the coordination work is lacking. Several people attack together, but often they cannot save it in time, so the gains do not outweigh the losses. In the first game against the Philippines, there was a very good opportunity, and the scores were often close. However, in the last few minutes, our guards committed two personal fouls, and the balls went into the basket and were penalized twice, and both hit, losing eight points in total. Otherwise, our team would have won long ago.</p>
<h3>(C) The Whole Team</h3>
<p>In terms of the whole team, the five-man zone defense still needs to be improved and should be practiced purely and skillfully. The first line of defense should be moved back a few feet, and the second line of defense should be moved forward one or two feet so that even if the enemy breaks through the first line of defense, it will not be in a dangerous position. When the enemy's third person sneaks into the first line of defense, one of the forwards must follow and monitor him. When the fourth person sneaks in, the second forward monitors him, and when all five people attack, the fifth person also needs to monitor him so that there is no need to worry. If the third and fourth people have passed through the first line of defense and are still defending the front, then there are more enemies than us, and there is no way not to lose. In terms of the four games in the Far East, our team's left and right forwards have no opportunity to shoot near the basket, so in the first, second, and third games, the two generals Tang and Yao have no results to record. The reason why Tang Baokun was able to score nine goals in the fourth game was mostly due to the effectiveness of long-range shots, so long-range shooting practice should not be taken lightly. If you encounter an enemy who closes the door and defends himself, you have to use it. Our team played against Japan for the second time. In the first half, our team was defeated by a score of 21 to 11. In the second half, we changed the lineup and used all substitutes to compete with them, and the score continued to increase. The closest difference was only two goals. Finally, the regular team was completely replaced and lost to Japan by a score of 21 to 37. This is enough to prove that the regular team's offense is not effective. Tang and Yao are good at short passes and shooting under the basket. When there is no way to advance and no one to pass to, they shoot from a distance. In this instant, the enemy has already returned to defense or has been robbed or grabbed, so they cannot enter the basket. The vice team has not received strict training, and the coordination work is far inferior to the regular team, but their opportunistic long-range shots are faster and more accurate than the regular team. Although this is mostly personal performance, in terms of the Japanese team's formation, its weaknesses are just like ours, so using the long-range attack method is quite successful. If you talk about ball skills, the vice team is not as good as the regular team. However, in the second game against Japan, the method used by the vice team can be said to be appropriate and pertinent, while the regular team uses the speed of advance and retreat of the midfielder Liu Jianchang as the standard. If Liu advances quickly, there are more opportunities to score. If Liu advances slowly, there are fewer opportunities to score. If Liu retreats to defend, there is almost no hope of scoring. Only this gentleman stays in the back, how can our team not be defeated?</p>
<p>Looking at the results of our team's four games:</p>
<p>(China 丨 Japan)</p>
<p>First time 24 丨 39</p>
<p>Second time 21 丨 37</p>
<p>(China 丨 Philippines)</p>
<p>First time 24 丨 39</p>
<p>Second time 43 丨 48</p>
<p>Then you know that the Japanese pay attention to defense, and their two guards do not easily go out to fight. The score obtained by our team is only 24 and 21. The Philippine team is not the same. Their attack is either with four people or five people, so their interior is slightly empty, and our opportunities for short passes and bottom shooting methods are many, so their results are also better, and they almost defeated the Philippine team for the last time. This shows that our team's talent is not weak, but it is a pity that they know themselves but do not know the other. Once they get a method, they are complacent and self-satisfied, revealing a sure-win ticket and unwilling to study in detail. It is said that pride brings loss. It is indeed a lesson for our basketball team. Alas, the past is gone, the future can be pursued. There are still ways to break the five-man zone defense, such as the short pass method. I sincerely hope that the gentlemen of our basketball team, if you still use this method to defend, you must thoroughly study it so that the enemy has no chance to take advantage of it, and our offensive method must also strive to be sophisticated so that even if the enemy has an iron wall and copper wall, they cannot defend against it. If this is the case, it is not only possible to dominate East Asia, but it is also not difficult to be called the best in Europe and America. This is what is hoped for.</p>

<h3>In Memory of Gu Daoqiu and Chen Boying</h3>
<p>Gu Wujiu, style name Daoqiu, sobriquet Lingyun, also known as Fumei, also used the pen name Shenzhou Jiudai, was from Lili Town, Wujiang County, Jiangsu Province. He was skilled in poetry, especially Ci poetry, inheriting the legacy of the "Among the Flowers" school. His wife, Ms. Xu, name Lan, sobriquet Lao Lan, was also skilled in poetry. Years ago, the Southern Society was a haven for elegance in the Southeast, and the society was full of talented people, and Gu was especially known as a strong one. His poems were elegant and charming, close to the style of Wen Tingyun and Li Shangyin. His calligraphy was very light, like silk fluttering, and he was pleased with himself. He was a man with revolutionary ideas and once engraved a small seal that said "Little Soldier Before the Revolutionary Army," which he often used. He looked like Zhang Liang. In Lili, he once dressed up and performed new plays, playing a woman, confusing people so they couldn't tell who he was. He also liked to wear a sleeveless jacket all year round. He was good at playing the Xiao flute, and after the rain, the sound of the flute would be like jade, uneven, making a weeping sound, as if complaining or appealing, and listeners would often feel lost. At home, when he had free time, Lao Lan would sing and Gu would accompany her with the Xiao. The pleasures of the boudoir could be compared to those of immortals. He considered himself invincible when it came to drinking, but he would only drink when he was about to get drunk. Every time he drank, he would use flying flowers as an order. Once, after a drinking party, he suddenly realized that the jadeite ring he was wearing was lost. He was greatly frightened and cried, telling his friend: "This ring belongs to Lao Lan. If I lose it, how can I face Lao Lan when I go home? Besides, I didn't want to drink today, but you dragged me to go, so this change happened. You must find this thing for me, otherwise, I will break off relations with you!" Although he broke off relations, he would still blame his friend for not being able to compensate him. His friend was very panicked, knowing that the way home was about a mile away, and he didn't know where he lost it, so how could he find any trace of it? So he comforted him with kind words and promised to compensate him. But Gu's crying became more and more vertical. He accidentally reached into his inner pocket and felt something. He pulled it out and it was indeed the jadeite ring. His friend was overjoyed and teased him. Gu didn't remember when he put it in. His drunkenness was mostly like this. Gu passed away last year, at the age of thirty-four. It is regrettable that he was not long-lived. An ancient poem says: "The eulogy was written by the wife of the deceased, and the posthumous manuscripts returned to the friends who died later." If you move it to Gu, the first sentence is accurate. The posthumous collection of Manshu has been published at home and abroad. How can Gu's talent be inferior to Manshu? Who is the person who declined his manuscripts? It is the responsibility of those who knew Gu. My friend, the owner of the Qiufeiqiu Hall, has dozens of Gu's small letters, saying that if anyone wants to compile a collection of Gu Daoqiu's posthumous works, they can borrow them.</p>
<h3>A Record of a Pleasant Banquet in Paris Xu Shiqi</h3>
<p>When I arrived in Paris with Mr. Minyi, the Minister to France, Gao Shuqing, sent a letter inviting us to a banquet with colleagues at the embassy. The chef from Fujian prepared delicious dishes. After eating Western food for a long time, I felt very uncomfortable. Suddenly, I got the precious delicacies of my home country, which made me enjoy them very much. The embassy is located on Babylone Street, in the 7th arrondissement of Paris, which is a very quiet place with no noise from traffic. Entering the door, there are rows of sculptures, and the electric lights are high up, shining brightly, solemn and gorgeous, fully expressing the beautiful characteristics of French architecture. In the hall, there is a half-length stone statue of Prime Minister Chen, surrounded by small portraits of famous people in the party and the country, and photos of Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum. In addition, there are Chinese halls, lounges, dining rooms, etc., which are exquisitely decorated and all beautiful. It is a pity that the embassy was not built by our country itself, but leased to the French. It is said that the monthly rent is about 10,000 francs.</p>
<p>In addition to Mr. Chu, those present included Admiral Du Xigui, former Deputy Foreign Minister Wu Shaoyou, Financial Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance Guo Jiezhi, and Yuan Shikai's son-in-law Yang Qishan, etc. There were five or six women present, none of whom I knew well. Ms. Zhang Yanan, an embassy staff member, has been traveling in Europe for ten years, and she and my wife, Manhua, both belong to Sichuan and talked very congenially. There were more than twenty people at the banquet, and the wine glasses were exchanged, which was very prosperous for a time. Minister Shuqing Gao is a senior member of the French alumni community, who studied astronomy and mathematics and was famous at the time. He also engaged in the study of geology and made many contributions. Now, he is even more engaged in diplomatic affairs and holds the position of foreign minister. It is said that he has been running around between heaven and earth, China and foreign countries, and has worked hard and made great contributions. Gao's son, Yangzhi, once worked with me in the Ministry of Health. He is proficient in medicine and resigned because of something. He went to France and this spring, he was hired by the Health Department of the International League of Nations to go to various European countries to investigate school health and infant care methods. In half a year, he traveled all over England, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Denmark, the Czech Republic, etc. When I arrived in the French capital, he had just returned from his guest trip. As an old friend overseas, his words were even more cordial. I relied on his guidance to wander around Paris. I scribbled this record to leave a trace of my visit.</p>
<h3>A University Student Who Sacrificed Himself While Swimming</h3>
<p>Lü Bing</p>
<p>Xia Jinping, a student at Jinling University in Nanjing, was a student in the university's Department of Agriculture and was about to graduate soon. Mr. Xia was a sports enthusiast. About a week ago, he invited three classmates to practice swimming in the river outside Tongji Gate. After jumping into the water, he drowned in just a few minutes. Everyone who heard about it expressed their regret. My landlord from Guangdong is from the same hometown as Mr. Xia and spoke about it in detail. I will select what is not mentioned in the newspapers and describe it as a lament for the sports world.</p>
<p>Mr. Xia liked swimming since he was a child in Guangdong. When he entered university, he was deeply ashamed that our country's sports were lagging behind, so he studied hard. He usually saved money on food and clothing to buy sports books. The day before his death, he was still holding a swimming book sent from overseas and reading it hard. In the summer of the year before last, Mr. Xia went to Hong Kong and once lost his footing on the pier and fell into the water. He was able to survive because he was familiar with swimming. Now he has died in the capital. It is likely that there are several reasons for this.</p>
<p>The river outside Tongji Gate is not deep or wide, and Mr. Luo, with his long practice, jumped in and sank immediately. When the rescuers pulled him ashore, his abdomen was not swollen and there was no water in it. The doctor diagnosed it as gas embolism, saying it was incurable. If so, then those who are familiar with swimming should pay attention to it, and this is also a problem that the sports world should study.</p>
<p>Mr. Xia's body was solid and his physical strength was also strong. Once he said to his fellow villagers that he was willing to devote his life to swimming so that he could one day occupy a seat on the international sports field. Otherwise, even if he died, he would not rest in peace. His words were very strong, but now he has died. Mr. Xia's eyes are probably not closed. Therefore, I record this to mourn him.</p>
<h3>Remembering Cyrano of Fudan University Yu Jianhua</h3>
<p>Last year, my female disciple Lu Yaqian used "Cyrano" as an analogy and praised it vigorously. I was too busy to read it, so I put it in my box. It wasn't until this year when Student Lu came to ask for it back that I read it. It was excellent. The plot is lively, the structure is extraordinary, the writing is excellent, and the thoughts are novel, which truly makes people admire it. The protagonist, Cyrano, is a martial artist, swordsman, and poet, but his nose is particularly large and his appearance is ugly, which makes his arrogant nature turn into stubborn and unkind. Anyone who offends his nose will be humiliated, even to the point of bloodshed. He loves his cousin Roxane, but Roxane loves the handsome but talentless guardsman Christian. Cyrano uses his eloquence and energy to write for Christian, and the two eventually marry. The play has five acts and is very long, with hundreds of actors. The Fudan Drama Society has always been famous. Professor Hong Shen has been diligently and assiduously devoting himself to the rehearsal of this play. When I first heard about it, I laughed and thought that it would be difficult to achieve. Now it has been rehearsed and will be performed at Fudan on the evening of the 10th. I really want to see what happens. It just so happens that my female disciple Li Qinqian is also in the play and sincerely invited me, so I went to watch it. Unfortunately, I only watched two acts, and it was already late, so I reluctantly returned home. There were many spectators that day. The students of the school were already crowded by six o'clock. Many male students brought three or four books and rushed to be the first to put the books on the seats to occupy them, and then looked forward to it. It was for their girlfriends. The one who plays Cyrano is Mr. Ma Yanxiang. His attitude is calm, his words are clear, and his actions are lively, adding a lot of color to the play. His particularly prominent big nose is made of the dregs of chewing gum eaten by dozens of people. The one who plays Roxane is Ms. Liang Peishu. Her face is beautiful, her words are gentle, and her expression is delicate. The rest of the cast has more than seventy people. Some of them have words that are not very clear, but in general, they can express the plot without much regret, which can be said to be very successful. Although Mr. Hong Shen has put in a lot of effort, he can also be proud of himself.</p>
<h3>Gourd Snakes and Snake Gourds by Zheng Yimei</h3>
<p>In Wusu, there is a Huangdi-school physician named Xu Hanqing. A patient suddenly arrived at his clinic the other day, severely ill and unable to move, carried in by others. Upon examination, his left foot was swollen and painful, appearing bluish-black. Due to the swelling, its size was twice that of his right foot; when he stood, it was almost unrecognizable as his own limb. Hanqing, observing his condition, knew he was engaged in farming and said, "Were you not bitten by a gourd snake?" The patient replied, "Yes." It turned out the patient was a farmhand, what is commonly called a "long-term worker." Returning at night under a beautiful moonlight, he passed by a melon patch where the tendrils clung to newly ripened gourds. He suddenly felt a gourd wriggling. As he was wondering, the snake-shaped gourd bit his foot, catching him completely off guard. Hanqing said, "The gourd snake is very poisonous. Fortunately, you sought treatment early; otherwise, if the swelling had spread past your knee, even Bian Que reborn could not have saved you. Now, no medicine is needed, or if you take medicine it will be useless. After you return home, pick a tender gourd, mash it into a thick juice, and apply it to the bite, and you will be healed." The patient did as he was told, and it worked indeed. That a snake resembles a gourd is already rare, but that a gourd resembles a snake is truly an unbelievable wonder of the world. I recall that a certain great dignitary from our country went to Japan. The Japanese hosted a grand banquet in his honor, inviting geishas. Then, attendants brought in a basket of snake gourds. The dignitary, repulsed by their frightening shape, dared not taste them. Everyone else at the table savored them, praising their sweet, crisp fragrance beyond compare. One of the geishas, who grew up on the Thousand Islands, said, "This is a local specialty of my hometown, very difficult to cultivate. Too much rain, they rot; too much sun, they wither, so they are not easily obtained. Those who get them consider them precious. I heard that when Li Hongzhang came to our country, he once tasted it and praised it endlessly."</p>

<h3>Eastern Travel Correspondence (7) by Wu Xiaohou</h3>
<p>An Overview of Tokyo City Finance: Tokyo's urban culture has advanced, and various projects have increased dramatically. Both before the Great Kanto Earthquake in September of Taisho 12 (1923) and during the urgent reconstruction efforts after the earthquake, the increase in its budget cannot be measured by ordinary standards. In Meiji 21 (1888), Tokyo's annual expenditure was only 3,355,340 yen. Now, after more than twenty years of continuous growth, the pure annual expenditure for Showa 4 (1929), when I went to Tokyo for research, has reached 213,478,833 yen, a massive increase of more than sixty-three times. I will discuss Tokyo's economy, annual income and expenditure, city assets, city debt, and ward budgets in five sections.</p>
<p>(1) City Economy: The city economy is divided into ordinary and special categories. Ordinary economy covers general income and expenditure, including general administrative expenses, education, civil engineering, sanitation, parks, cemeteries, social services, urban projects, reconstruction, and restoration projects. Special economy is more complex than ordinary economy, broadly divided into eighteen categories: (1) Water supply economy; (2) Public cafeteria expenses economy; (3) Pawnshop expenses economy; (4) Labor wage advance and job travel expense loan fund economy; (5) Employee loan fund economy; (6) Public bond repayment economy; (7) Fire mutual aid fund economy; (8) Supplies and factory economy; (9) Reconstruction construction loan fund economy; (10) Ten district division consolidation settlement fund economy; (11) Orphanage economy; (12) Electric railway vehicle industry expenses economy; (13) Electric supply enterprise expenses economy; (14) Passenger automobile enterprise expenses economy; (15) Elevated railway enterprise expenses economy; (16) Electric enterprise debt reduction fund economy; (17) Electric enterprise factory accounting and storage item expenses economy; (18) Electric research institute economy.</p>
<p>(2) City Income and Expenditure: The total annual expenditure for Showa 4 (1929) was 308,679,026 yen, with a net expenditure of 213,478,833 yen. Of this, the ordinary economy accounted for 79,920,891 yen, and the special economy accounted for 133,557,942 yen. The total annual income was 315,977,325 yen, with a net income of 210,840,317 yen.</p>
<p>(3) City Assets: City assets are divided into city-owned assets and accumulated funds. (1) The total amount of city-owned assets is currently over 561,660,000 yen, including about 14 million yen in cash. The rest is a general estimate of auxiliary products, land, works, and buildings. (2) Accumulated funds are divided into twenty-three types: (1) Basic property; (2) Education basic property; (3) Tsukiji Hospital basic property; (4) Fixed funds; (5) Social service basic property; (6) Disaster relief basic property; (7) Neighborhood mutual aid basic property; (8) Retirement allowance and bereaved family support fund; (9) Park reserve fund; (10) Cemetery reserve fund; (11) 50th anniversary of the capital commemoration project reserve fund; (12) Water supply preparation reserve fund; (13) Public debt repayment fund; (14) Public cafeteria reserve fund; (15) Orphanage basic property; (16) Electric railway enterprise preparation reserve fund; (17) Electric railway enterprise impairment compensation fund; (18) Electric supply enterprise preparation reserve fund; (19) Electric supply enterprise impairment compensation fund; (20) Passenger automobile enterprise preparation reserve fund; (21) Passenger automobile enterprise impairment compensation fund; (22) Electric research institute preparation reserve fund; (23) Electric research institute impairment compensation fund. The total amount of the above twenty-three types is over 19,120,000 yen.</p>
<p>(4) City Debt: Due to the urgent progress of the capital's reconstruction and restoration projects, Tokyo has had to issue municipal bonds in addition to annual income. According to the budget for Showa 4 (1929) alone, the total amount of debt raised was over 74,682,000 yen. The total amount of municipal bonds borrowed over the years, as of the end of March in Showa 4 (1929), was over 741,280,000 yen. Excluding the amount already repaid, the current outstanding debt is over 485,753,000 yen. Averaging this across the entire population of Tokyo, each person owes 226 yen and 65 sen. While owing more than 220 yen of municipal debt per person is not a small amount, most of the debt raised is used for local education, public welfare, and production projects. It is said that "what is taken from the people is used for the people," so the citizens are happy to bear it.</p>
<p>(5) Ward Budgets: Wards are independent autonomous entities. Having acquired corporate status, the ward's finances are also worthy of study. Tokyo is divided into fifteen wards. The total amount of annual income for the ordinary economy is 7,873,494 yen. The regular part of annual expenditure is 3,296,089 yen, and the temporary part of annual expenditure is 4,577,405 yen. The total annual expenditure is 7,873,494 yen, so income and expenditure are balanced. The special economy has an annual income of 173,993 yen and an expenditure of 172,397 yen. Income exceeds expenditure, leaving a surplus for activities. As I was drafting this, sitting idly in my lonely hotel room, I suddenly received a poem from Chen Shaojun, a comrade from the Capital News Reporters Association, who sent me a farewell poem from Jiao Mountain in China, with linked rhymes: "The speed of the ring is unbroken is Jiao Mountain, together we go to Jiao Mountain to admire the sacred face, making Buddhas and immortals, the original fantasy, how can we bear the sorrow on our brows." He also attached a poem inspired by climbing Jiao Mountain: "The long sky is vast, the water flows east, the sails and waves draw visitors' sorrow. If heaven has feelings, it creates all things; the landscape is unharmed, inviting leisurely游. Slowly say the dust sea waves are bad; after the calamity, the body is like a seagull on the river. Worries are not quelled, sorrow is not over; revenge remains in the heart." Reading it again and again, my vexations were completely washed away, as if I had taken a dose of cooling medicine.</p>

<p>Gold Market Continues to Advance</p>
<p>With clear and peaceful conditions, the gold price continued to rise yesterday, the 14th. The market atmosphere was quite peaceful. The morning market experienced only minor fluctuations of around two taels. Foreign exchange was already quoted a notch lower, and internal tensions were high. Banks sold slightly, and trading by various firms was mostly sluggish, such as Hengxing, Yuancheng, Yongzhi, Feng, Yongfu, Chang, Wanxing, etc., whose receipts and disbursements were irregular. However, the sentiment among traders was one of latent bullishness. But calculating based on drafts, the price was pressed down to over 70 taels. As the silver market opened low in the morning, it immediately opened high, and buying seemed strong, making the market seem even firmer. It reached 577 taels. Afterwards, it became slightly chaotic, hovering around 75 taels. At noon, it closed between 76 taels, and the image of strong drafts continued. As for the British silver, without any change, the silver price fell by 25.</p>
<p>The July gold price initially opened at 573 taels and 7 mace, an increase of 2 taels and 6 mace. The gross price rose from 73 taels and 6 mace to 77 taels, showing that buyers were active. Recently, British gold was traded between banks at 6 1/2 pence to a shilling. Quotations had already decreased by 250 US cents. Japanese gold increased by 1.875 cents. However, the gold price was soft and weak, which was due to Zhifengyong and others selling off. At that time, it was 75 taels, and then it immediately increased by 5 or 6 mace. In an instant, it fell back about 2 taels, calculating to be 73 taels and 8 mace. This was due to hedgers settling British gold and selling drafts. In September, Sumitomo sold off at 6 1/2 pence. Before long, it seemed to be rising, at 8 mace. Sanjing sold British gold in August at 6.4375 pence. The positions bought on the table were slightly more numerous, so they incrementally increased by over 2 taels. However, from 10:00 to 11:00, there were mutual declines of 2 taels, and foreign exchange was consistently sharp. At 11:12, it was 76 taels, 3 or 4 mace. Afterwards, Fuyu, Tianyu, Yong and others sold slightly, and HSBC sold British gold for September at 6 1/2 pence, resulting in a fall of 1 tael, 5 or 6 mace. At noon, it was 74 taels and 8 mace. Immediately, some short sellers covered their positions, and it rebounded by several mace. British gold for this month was not easily settled at 6.3125 pence. Japanese gold was being sought at 1 tael, 3 mace, 3 cents. The forward price was 1 tael, 3 mace, 1 cent, 8.75 mils. By noon, the closing price was 575 taels and 3 mace, an increase of 4 taels and 2 mace compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The discounted price was 70 taels. The highest price in half a day was 77 taels, and the lowest price was 73 taels and 6 mace, a difference of 3 taels and 4 mace. The quoted price had changed to 645 taels and 6 mace, a discount of over 70 taels. The registration surcharge was also 75 taels. The spot market opened at 73 taels and closed at 75 taels, which was lower than the Bund price, so it was a discounted market.</p>
<p>Still Lacking Large Transactions: Trading by various firms was still not large. Chunfa, Yongtaixing, and Dadecheng all made small entries. Hengxing, Zhifengyong, Yongfuchang, Yuancheng, and Yongwanxing Yuan Tai, etc., had mixed entries and exits. Yuanmao, Yongtai, Fengrun, Chunyuan, Yutai, Yongyuan, Cheng Fuyu, etc., mostly sold. The receipts and disbursements of various firms were still irregular. There were entries and exits of hedging drafts, but not many. The Dalian gang sold a total of 1,000 drafts and entered 700 to 800 drafts. The Cantonese gang had a small number of entries and exits, appearing balanced. The afternoon was due to the usual weekend holiday. The exchange will start switching weeks on Monday, the 16th, so the market will open at 8:00 in the morning, etc.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Quoted a Notch Lower</h3>
<p>Internal market is particularly tight due to settlement of accounts.</p>

<h3>Weekend Silver De-facto Oddly Loose</h3>
<p>Heavy Drawers, Extremely Out of Line</p>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday, the number six was a holiday for banks in the afternoon. There was an unusually large amount of withdrawal from the morning. The number of heavy drawer backers was suddenly large, and the market for chips was suddenly flooded. The result of this influence was that, because no one was accepting them, the large number of heavy drawer backers had no choice but to transfer to buying foreign money or sending it to the warehouse to prepare for Monday's dragon appearance. This market was rarely seen in the first half of the year. It is usually sparse during this summer season. This year, due to the overall relationship with the market, there have been repeated changes, so the discovery came later.</p>
<p>The Price of Funds "Foreign Cent" in the early market was 7 cents, 1 cent and 6 mils, a small drop of half a mil compared to the previous day's afternoon market. The situation was inherently weak. In the afternoon market, some people suddenly started buying, which offset the foreign account holders, so the cent price was considered to be a bit firm. The result was an improvement of 2 haos and 5 sis compared to the early market, at 7 cents, 1 cent, 6 mils and 2 haos and 5 sis. "Silver Funds" the trading market and money in the early morning were 1 cent and 4 sis, roughly the same as the big picture of the previous day. The early market was suddenly oddly loose, and the listed price of 5 cents could be seen as a sign of a very loose market. Until the heavy drawers were not added with water and there were no white drawers, there was no one who wanted them, and it was even more lax. Of course, there were no problems in the small general meeting. The banks' listed price was 6 cents.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Situation: The Jiangnan small foreign currency in the early market was 6 cents, 3 sis and 4 mils, an increase of 2 sis and a half compared to the previous day's afternoon market. The afternoon market did not move. Trading was done like the early market at 5,000 jiao. Guangdong small foreign currency in the early market was 5 cents, 9 sis, 2 mils, 8 haos, 7 mils and a half. The afternoon market was 5 cents, 9 sis, 3 mils and 2 haos and a half. Transactions done in the early market were 195,000 jiao. The afternoon market was limited to only 50,000 jiao. Copper coins have not changed for a long time. Yesterday it was still 410 strings.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Entries and Exits: "Silver Funds" yesterday were rare because of the Saturday settlement. Only special withdrawals and telegraphic transfers poured in, so the situation was not very light. Chinese merchants collected 2.1 million silver, foreign merchants collected 1.4 million, withdrawals and other withdrawals were more than 2 million, telegraphic transfers were more than 1 million, various freight charges and taxes collected 7.67 million, collateral withdrawals and redemptions were more than 1 million, and 1.7 million were withdrawn from the warehouse.

Money changers and silver public single collection was more than 25 million, the heavy drawer withdrawal was more than 2.8 million, and various road remittances were 890,000.

Afternoon Market 10,000. Foreign banknotes Early Market 138,000. Afternoon 155,000. Bank side buying and selling in the early and afternoon market, each six hundred thousand.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Turning Bright</h3>
<p>Entirely Pulled Tight by Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Overseas cotton yarn is consistently downstream. The local market has not been affected. The exchange rate is stable, so although overseas market conditions have fallen, it is no less than an explicit or implicit rise when calculated. The buying party's attitude is strong, and most tend to be bullish. Rui Da Co. continues to sell 3,000 bales, but there is no impact, it can be said.</p>
<p>The public price of Rui Da is unique at 3,000 bales. The public price initially opened flat. As foreign cotton fell by 23 cents, the market turned bullish, especially due to those taking empty positions due to a slight contraction in the exchange market. As a result, the monthly price increased by 1 cent. In the afternoon, individual buyers entered, and the months firmed up. All months increased by 2, 3, 5 cents. It was found that Rui Da Co. had sold a total of more than 3,000 bales in the previous two markets. Statistics on the total transactions for the whole day totaled 9,050 bales. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Public Price Closing Price, Increase/Decrease, Inventory, September 15.89, Up 3, 21,500</p>
<p>June 15.55, Up 4, 19,150 October 15.97, 322,000</p>
<p>July 15.65, Up 5, 21,850 November 16.00, 213,250</p>
<p>August 15.77, 227,000</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Demand Weak: The spot yarn market is dull. It was found that all the gangs bought a total of 450 bales, and 110 bales entered the same industry. The market is mediocre. Among the various gangs, Niuzhuang entered 100 bales, the Mainland 65 bales, Nanyang 55 bales, Xuzhou 45 bales, Tianjin 40 bales, Ningbo 30 bales, Hankou 45 bales, Guangdong 30 bales, Xiamen 25 bales, and Qinhuangdao 15 bales, etc.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Situation Stable</h3>
<p>American cotton's falling wind is quite strong. Distant months are breaking the 4-cent mark. However, the local market can still be maintained. The bottom goods are depleted. The exchange market is still firm. Although the price has fallen, there is still an implicit rise. Bullish thinking is still strong. However, the Han gang sells when the price rises. There are also many who look favorably on new cotton in distant months. The future is still difficult to predict temporarily.</p>
<p>The Han standard is good for 1 cent. The Han standard initially opened and fell by 1 cent with the American cotton. In the second market, the market rose again due to the sharp contraction in the exchange rate. Each month increased by 5 cents. In the afternoon, individual buyers entered, and the situation was still tight. However, the Han gang sold 2,000 dan. Each month increased by 5 cents to 1 cent. Statistics on the total transactions for the whole day totaled 26,300 dan. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Han Standard Closing Price, Increase/Decrease, Inventory, August 37.50, Up 5, 679,000</p>

<p>July 36.90, Up 5, 677,000 November 36.75, 1,552,200</p>
<p>Factory Demand Completely Halted: The spot cotton business is cold. Factory demand has again come to a halt. The source is estimated to be 300 bales of Tonghua and 1,020 bales of Yaohua, etc.</p>
<h3>Foreign Yarn and Cotton Prices Drop Across the Board</h3>
<p>American Cotton Continues to Fall 30 Points: Yesterday, American cotton futures initially strengthened due to speculative buying, but later weakened due to western sales and good harvests.

<h3>American Cotton Situation Remains Depressed</h3>
<p>Expanded Talk of Cotton Mills Reducing Work</p>
<p>Cotton Goods Transactions Remain Sluggish</p>
<p>Government to Maintain with 50 Million</p>
<p>New York, 13th, telegraphs the cotton market situation for the past week, saying that the week's weather and cotton crop news are all favorable to the short side, so New York cotton prices have fallen. However, the bulls, considering the approaching date of the first announcement, are liquidating July contracts, which is also a reason for instability in sentiment. Registered cotton stocks stored at designated delivery ports and Savannah currently total about 700,000 bales, of which 576,000 bales are owned by cooperatives. It is heard that the Department of Agriculture will lend 50 million yuan to the cotton industry maintenance society so that it can receive the old cotton accumulated in the market from the cooperatives before the new cotton is listed. It is estimated that the cooperatives hold at least 150,000 bales and up to 200,000 bales of July contracts. Showers this week seem quite favorable to new cotton, but the estimated reduction in cotton fields is only about 2 percent. Cotton goods transactions remain sluggish, and manufacturers are currently planning to continue reducing work and are even considering increasing the degree of reduction.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that the July bulls are continuously liquidating. Representatives of the cooperatives stated that the society has not sold spot goods. Demand is poor, and cotton cloth trade is slow. Domestic cotton consumption in May was 180,000 bales less than the same month last year. New cotton crops are progressing as usual. The weekend statistics are attached below (unit: 10 bales):</p>

<h3>Grain Futures and Spot Prices See Unprecedented Wild Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Instant Noodles Jump to 2 Taels 6 Qian 6</p>
<p>Spot Prices Call for as High as 2 Taels 8</p>
<p>Yesterday, the noodle market opened with prices rising sharply, and people's hearts were stirred by the heavy rain. Market conditions and buying interest were equally high. In the afternoon, the first session saw an even stronger surge, with long-term prices reaching 2 taels 6 qian 5 or 6 fen, soaring more than 1 qian from the previous day, and short-term prices also rising by 6 fen and a half to 9 fen 75. Factories do not have abundant stock, and prices are also as high as 2 taels 7 qian and a half to 2 taels 8 qian. Both spot and futures noodle prices are at unprecedented levels. This is because there is a lack of rice and grain in the country, and people hoped that foreign aid would be provided, but this major foreign aid has been cut off. After the surge, some bulls returned, and prices leveled off. The final closing prices were: June, up 4 fen 25; July, up 8 fen; August, up 8 fen and a half; September and October, up 7 fen and a half each; November, up 7 fen 25. Before closing, the Social Bureau also stopped the surge. The opening price next week may be slightly lower, which is not surprising.</p>
<h3>Wheat Prices Jump Wildly by More Than 1 Qian Due to Rain</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the wheat market opened, prices for all months rose sharply due to the rain and expectations of a large crop. Bulls continued to buy, and the noodle market surged wildly. People's hearts and market prices soared. August rose by more than 1 qian and a half, and other months rose by about 1 qian. At closing, the bulls sold off, and prices leveled off slightly. June closed up 7 fen; July, up 8 fen; August, up 1 qian 9; September, October, and November, each up 6 fen. New wheat arrivals are very abundant, and factories are particularly greedy. The opening prices were: old wheat, 2,000 packs at 5 taels and 3 fen; new wheat, 22,000 packs at high 5 taels 05 fen, medium 4 taels 9 qian, and low 4 taels 7 or 8 qian. Old wheat was at 5 taels 3 qian 3 fen. Each rose 3-5 fen.</p>
<h3>Hexia Rice Market Rises</h3>
<p>Top Grade Japonica Reaches 22 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the supply from Zhabei was still scarce, with only the No. 10 batch arriving. Total inventory in the river was more than 10,000 stones, and sales were quite active. White japonica saw a rise of 1 or 2 jiao. Special top-grade japonica even reached 22 yuan. Currently, Zhongguan japonica is also at 20 yuan. Prices for Guanwai old rice are increasing steadily, and the supply is becoming increasingly scarce. Although the purchase price in this street is average, the price is still 1 jiao higher. Special top-grade goods require around 21 yuan. Retail sales of pointed rice are excellent. Because the Yangdu pointed rice sold here recently is mostly replaced by foreign rice, the standard price of this local pointed rice should be between 19 yuan and a half and 20 yuan. The price is slightly rising. Buying interest is not high, but due to the scarce supply, the situation is turning tight. Top-grade yuan opens at 18 yuan 2 jiao.</p>
<p>The arrival of river rice in South Shanghai is very scarce, and street sales are quite active. Changshu, Wuxi, Suzhou, and other machine-milled white japonica are scarce due to the inverted prices between the production area and the Shanghai market, coupled with the impact of rain on the source of supply. The reason is that machine mills still have a very small inventory. Currently, the sales in rural areas are very good, and prices are rising. The actual price for high-quality goods is about 21 yuan. Even middle-grade japonica from Tongli County requires about 19 yuan and a half. The arrival of early-season rice from Nanbang is even more scarce, with a slight increase of about 1 jiao. Turnover is showing a negative trend, and sales are booming. Diao Fang is preventing a shortage of later arrivals, and the intention to purchase is increasing. Therefore, top-grade yuan is seeing a tightening of 1 jiao and a half, opening at 18 yuan.</p>
<h3>More Than 20,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Traded</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice sales were strong and prices were rising. Because noodle and wheat prices were affected by rain, people's sentiment rose again and again. There were only a small number of transactions along the Yangtze River, but both local and inland buyers in this street had great interest. Total market transactions may exceed 20,000, and prices immediately rose by more than 1 jiao. Afterwards, transshipment and sales became active, and the market situation still needs to be looked at optimistically. It is estimated that 3,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon were traded at prices ranging from 16 yuan 3 jiao to 15 yuan 9 jiao 2 fen; 5,000 bags of No. 2 were traded at 15 yuan 2 jiao and a half; 5,000 bags of Xiao Jiao were traded at 15 yuan 4 jiao; 6,500 bags of Da Jiao were traded at 15 yuan 1 jiao; 1,000 bags of Min Dang were traded at 15 yuan 8 jiao and a half; and 1,000 bags of road goods were traded at 15 yuan 7 jiao. Min Dang coarse rice was traded for 1,000 bags at 14 yuan 4 jiao, and Xiao Jiao coarse rice was traded for 700 bags at 13 yuan 8 jiao and a half.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea New Factories Transferred to Shanghai via American Telegraph</h3>
<p>Japanese Silk Prices Rise, Market Prices Expected to Rise by 10-20 Taels: Yesterday, in the local foreign silk market, new factories were gradually launched for sales through the United States. Yokohama Japanese silk telegram reported a price increase. New York silk telegram to Shanghai was not weak, and silk prices are expected to rise by 10-20 taels. Yesterday, Qianli and others priced B-grade new factories at 90 bags, fetching 1,156 taels. British and French prices remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Summer Cocoons Begin to Hatch</h3>
<p>The weather is too cold, and the silkworm season is not good. Most farmers in the silkworm-raising areas of Hangzhou and Shaoxing in Zhejiang Province are raising summer cocoons to make up for the losses from the spring silkworms this year. The amount of mulberry leaves fed in areas such as Linping, Yuhang, Xiaoshan, Xinchang, Chang'an, and Haining is still considerable. Unfortunately, the weather is too cold, and the development of the silkworms after receiving the flowers is slow. In addition, the continuous wind and rain have made the silkworm season unfavorable, and silkworm farmers are generally pessimistic.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Continues to Be Weak and Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of 772 boxes of green tea such as Zhenmei, Zhenmei, and Mawei, as well as Qimen black tea, were traded. There were no price increases or decreases in the market. However, the current key to the market depends entirely on the smooth sales of Russian merchants. Yesterday, it was heard that Mr. Kosulov, the manager of the Russian Cooperative Association, will arrive in Shanghai soon to start business, which is not far away. There seems to be no activity in British and French sales at present.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods and Vermicelli are Scarce and Prices are Soaring</h3>
<p>Recently, vermicelli has been selling well due to extremely low inventory in the market. Although goods are arriving one after another, the quantity is not large, and there are even fewer top-quality goods. Since the opening of the Tongshou goods last month, the price of over 100 packs has risen from 8 taels and 8 qian to 8 taels and 9 qian. Yesterday, dozens of packs opened at 9 taels, and the top-quality Hongfa brand opened at 50 packs at 9 taels and 2 qian, which were all very popular. According to production news, prices still need to rise, which is why there has been such a wild surge due to the lack of continuous supply.</p>
<h3>Sea Powder is Devalued Due to Mold</h3>
<p>Sea powder has not arrived for a long time. It is found that there is also little stock on the market. It is even rarer for those with fresh green color. However, now is the season of yellow mold, and this thing is extremely prone to discoloration when exposed to moisture. Therefore, although there is not much stock in the current market, the selling price is seeing a decline. Yesterday, the market price had fallen by about two and a half, and the stock in Ningbo market was thicker and the price was also lower.</p>

<h3>Chen Baoyi's Impressions of Ms. Zilan's Solo Exhibition</h3>
<p>When I look at other people's paintings, I always feel happy, partly because of the interest in viewing the paintings and partly because of the points of study. Especially when I see pleasant paintings, I get excited. Of course, this is not just me; I am afraid that anyone who loves painting and looking at paintings will feel the same.</p>
<p>However, on the one hand, I also think that the understanding and love of paintings vary from person to person. Even among artists, there are those who often do not purely feel the paintings that are different from their own painting style, taste, and ideas, or even dismiss them as wrong. How much more so for viewers who are not artists? But the world is very complicated, and this situation is natural. Especially in our Western painting circles, which do not have a long history and are often trapped and underdeveloped, this situation is even more natural.</p>
<p>Looking at our Western painting circles as a whole, they have always seemed to be in chaos. But recently, thanks to the efforts of many comrades, our Western painting circles have gradually shown signs of progress. On the one hand, more and more people are going abroad to study and research art. On the other hand, more and more people are able to learn and pursue art according to their own feelings and only seek to develop from within themselves. Although these two aspects seem slightly different, they are both necessary in our broad art world, and they are gratifying for the overall progress of us all.</p>
<p>Thinking further about the situation in our art garden, that is, the entire art world, no matter how many buds are gradually emerging now, no matter how complex the art trends are becoming, I feel that from the standpoint of art research and development, the emergence and growth of art buds are what people who are interested in art are eagerly hoping for. If good buds are about to emerge in this art garden, not only should those who expect to enjoy "art flowers" on this land think about how to love and cultivate them, but we artists, who are also buds, should feel happy about the prosperity of the garden. In short, I feel that the continuous growth and blooming of "art flowers" that adorn our land are beneficial to the lives of us humans. Therefore, I eagerly hope that various healthy buds will grow in our art garden, each exerting its own generative power.</p>
<p>Ms. Guan Zilan's art is also something we know that has come from its healthy buds.</p>
<p>I have had frequent opportunities to see the growth of good art for several years. I have seen that Guan has been growing naturally in her own good growth, and is still growing. How far she will grow in the future is something I cannot foresee now.</p>
<p>When I saw Guan's paintings, I felt that the bright and cheerful colors and the simple and straightforward techniques were all emitted by an extraordinary power. I feel that what gives us a deep impression is not only the pure and complete expression expressed by good, simple, free, and intuitive handling. Above this, we can also feel good, wonderful, and rhythmic vibrations. I feel that what still resonates in my heart after seeing good paintings is this kind of beautiful musical rhyme. I feel that these are all precious qualities in the development of good art.</p>
<p>I also feel that Guan has never seen various painting styles among many companions or predecessors, but in a good sense, Guan has not been tempted at all and has only been growing leisurely in her own feelings. This clearly shows how deep Guan's own expressive consciousness is, which is even greater than the original power of her self-development from external infection.</p>
<p>From the many works in this exhibition, we can see the various signs of Guan's progress in pursuing art. At the same time, we can also feel the potential of her development from these works.</p>
<p>I feel that these works are by no means limited to the nature of her growth. Her artistic progress is what we fellow artists are happily expecting. Apart from the several exhibitions that Ms. Guan's works have been in Shanghai and Japan in previous years, this is the first solo exhibition of her works in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Originally, holding an exhibition is a very troublesome thing for artists. Especially in our art world today, there are various inconveniences. But thinking about the current situation in our country and from the point of contact between art and society, exhibitions are a very direct and beneficial tool. We comrades all believe that Ms. Guan's intention to publish some of her works during this period for her colleagues to evaluate and for most people to appreciate is a beautiful thing and we greatly approve of it.</p>
<h3>Hua Bin of the New French Painting Scene</h3>
<p>The main painting movements that are most vigorous and have become the backbone of modern Paris can be roughly divided into Fauvism, Cubism, Constructionism, Realism, New Realism, and Naturalism.</p>
<p>Fauvism This movement occupies an important position in the current painting scene. Its representative artists include Matisse, Raoul, and Derain.</p>
<p>Matisse is the most representative of the Fauvist spirit. He has been making excellent works since 1902. His Spanish "Dancer," "Goldfish," "Still Life," and the black-toned Three Sisters painting, as well as the 1919 "Woman with a White Feather Hat," which came out around 1910, are the most outstanding. Afterwards, he gradually reversed his naked emotions of the past and moved towards refined techniques. He is one of the most popular figures among art dealers in Paris today.</p>
<p>Raoul is not as ordinary as Matisse, but his strong and deep expression is the most important artist in the painting scene.</p>
<p>Derain has many masterpieces from his Fauvist activities. After being baptized by Fauvism, his unique classical works are equally valued by contemporary art. He is one of the popular figures in modern times.</p>
<p>Cubism This force is still very strong, and it can be seen in the ideological foundations of many artists. Picasso and Braque are the founders of this school and the most representative artists.</p>
<p>Picasso His talent is unparalleled for a time. His unruly genius has allowed him to create a variety of different works, such as the Portrait of Picasso's Wife, which is the ultimate work of Neoclassicism. Recently, his works can also be seen to fall within the scope of New Realism, but in the end he is regarded as the most representative artist of Cubism and occupies an important position together with Braque.</p>
<p>Constructionism Leoult is currently the most representative artist of this school.</p>
<p>Realism Vlaminck is the most representative modern artist of this school.</p>
<p>Vlaminck initially joined the Fauvist movement with Derain. He is currently the number one figure in Realism, expressing that strong style. After Courbet's Realism, he paid attention to the description of materials. The works in the early Fauvist activities were quite similar to the spirit and movement of Gogh. After the European War, he gradually focused on the concept of material reality, and there were many places to learn from Cézanne. Later, his colors became like a dichotomy of black and white, producing his unique and powerful realism. However, recently his works have shown a slight color.</p>
<p>Naturalism This name is a bit inappropriate to put here, but for the sake of convenience, Utrico and Friesz are classified here.</p>
<p>Utlico He is a painter of street scene poets. His simple spirit and powerful depiction are very valuable. Recently, the color tone of his works has become brighter, but it does not have the simple charm of his old works.</p>
<p>Friesz His placement among the Realist artists is quite justified. For example, his old works "Old Poet," "Mrs. Friesz," and the "Two Nudes" exhibited at the 1925 Autumn Salon all show his realistic power. But many of the landscape paintings he has made since then are simply sketches close to Naturalism. Recently, many art dealers have been working to raise his value.</p>
<p>New Realism This school is close to Fauvism, Expressionism, or so-called Futurism. It is a kind of free and chaotic style. Chagal is a representative artist of this school.</p>
<p>Chagal He was influenced by Cubism and gradually moved towards the pure art of emotion and intoxication, becoming an expression of the middle between New Realism and Fauvism. The color and feeling are extremely fresh, and he is a special painter in the Paris art scene.</p>
<p>Also, the same artist paints in a variety of painting styles at the same time. Picasso is the most noteworthy figure.</p>
<p>Also, Dufy is an artist who emphasizes decorative effects. He is also noteworthy in the current painting scene. He was once baptized by Fauvism. His rich modern artistic talent and agility of senses make his paintings have a very strong and fresh interest, and he is a distinctive artist.</p>
<p>In addition, painters such as Bonnard, who followed the impressionistic system of color tones, and his painting intoxicated atmosphere and agility of senses occupy an important position in the Paris art scene.</p>
<p>Segonzac He has had a considerable reputation since he produced two large works depicting couples under trees at the 1922 Autumn Salon. He has now occupied an important position in the current painting scene. His deep and heavy power makes his works extremely valuable. This tendency has continued for many years until recently, when the color tones have gradually become brighter, showing the refined air of the French.</p>
<p>In addition to these artists, there is a group of excellent young artists who are active in the Autumn Salon and the Independent Salon, making the Paris art scene very lively. The truth and enthusiasm of these young artists are really promising in the future.</p>

His natural state is both soft and relaxed. The plot of *Starting Out* tells the story of an ignorant young man who, having just started out in the world, has a beautiful wife at home but doesn't want her, instead risking his life to pursue a famous thief. The scenes of robbing prisons and fighting are both astonishing and hilarious, and it is undoubtedly the best of all comedy films, and so on.</p>
<p>The Central Grand Theater announces that since Charlie Chaplin changed his career to directing, he has not been quick to appear on the screen. Those who love to watch Chaplin's starring films are all eagerly waiting. Knowing that the public's expectations are high, Chaplin made an exception to star in *Step High*. This film is full of Chaplin's spirit, so those who love to watch Chaplin's works cannot help but laugh heartily when they see this film. This film will be shown at the Central Grand Theater starting today, with the same ticket prices and times as before, and so on.</p>
<p>The Paris Grand Theater announces that our theater will premiere today (Saturday) historical romance films set in the French court starring Dorothy Dwan and others, *Du Barry, Woman of Passion*. This film depicts the story of Madame du Barry, a favorite concubine during the reign of King Louis XV of France, who indulges in her own way, only posing and flirting, and falling in love with a painter. Their love is deep and they cannot bear to be apart for a moment. The people of the country dare to be angry but dare not speak out. The obscurity, mystery, passion, and joy of the story cannot be described by words, and so on.</p>
<p>The Odeon Theater on North Sichuan Road announces that our theater was dissatisfied with the original sound equipment's slightly turbid sound. We purchased the newest, most complete, and most excellent sound equipment from Western Electric at a high price and installed it separately, dismantling the old equipment and not using it. The new machine was installed and tested once the day before yesterday, and the clarity and beauty of the sound more than compensated for the shortcomings of the film and was unprecedented in Shanghai. Therefore, we will start using the new machine today and screen the Paramount Company's famous and expensive talkie, *The Love Parade*, as a commemoration. The new films and new equipment will surely be appreciated by the people of Shanghai, and so on.</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Xin Xin Cultural Troupe announces that the fourth preparatory meeting was held at the troupe's preparation office in Danfeng Lane, Avenue Edward VII. Zhu Weiqing, Zhu Tianyi, Ge Shouchong, Li Xulun, Li Mei, Wang Zhaosong, Cheng Jishi, Cai Fuyu, and other 37 people attended. Zhu Weiqing chaired the meeting, and the following resolutions were discussed and passed: (1) It was decided to appoint Zhu Weiqing, Zhu Tianyi, and Cheng Jishi as preparatory committee members stationed in Shanghai, with Zhu Weiqing as the standing member. (2) Report the preparatory situation to the Propaganda Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Consolidation Committee and file the seal for record. (3) Apply to the relevant authorities in Shanghai for recordation. (4) Prepare to hold a recreational performance. (5) Request the Provincial Consolidation Committee to send personnel to participate and guide the inaugural meeting. (6) Entrust Comrade Zhu Tianyi to contact the troupe's affairs along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line to facilitate performances.</p>
<p>The Tianyi Film Company announces that our company's production, *Yang Naiwu and Xiaobaicai*, is scheduled to be released at the Central Grand Theater starting on the 20th of this month. The drama is one of the forty strange stories in the unofficial history of the Qing Dynasty, with a tragic and moving plot. It stars Chen Yumei in a new masterpiece directed by the famous director Qiu Qixiang, with excellent results. At the time of the premiere, Chen Yumei and other 30-plus people will perform Yang Naiwu Beijing opera on stage, accompanied by a nine-tone ensemble.</p>

Now there are a few words to tell to the gentlemen from all walks of life who love to watch old operas at our theater. Our theater does not dare to boast, but everyone praises our theater so much, saying that our theater has the most famous actors. Moreover, all the famous actors, such as Kylin Tong, Little Yang Yuelou, Liu Hanchen, Yang Ruiting, etc., are particular about picking a good supporting cast. Since joining our theater one after another, our theater will not sing old operas. If we sing old operas, the show is simply as good as a joint performance by several troupes. It is indeed the reason. There will be an old opera during the day on the 15th. Please come and test it out, and so on.</p>

This scene of ascending the altar and becoming Prime Minister is arranged very solemnly, with a brand new imperial carriage, a brand new background, a brand new costume, a brand new attire, all new and special, nothing is not new.

<h3>A Worthy Educator of Music: Ke Hua</h3>
<p>After listening to a rehearsal at the Wang Ruixian Music Studio</p>
<p>The great value of music is universally acknowledged by scholars of all ages and countries. Shakespeare said, "Without music, there is no nation." Ruskin said, "Music is the most direct, most orderly, and most complete physical and mental pleasure, and it is the only one that can provide the same help to people of all ages." Why do scholars of all ages value music so much? In a word, it is because music has a great power to influence national character.</p>
<p>In China, it is regarded as a "minor skill and trivial pursuit." Some, though learning music due to the introduction of Western culture, mostly aim for leisurely pastimes, or, to put it more bluntly, young ladies use their ability to play to satisfy their vanity (but this is not a generalization, because otherwise there would be no following text). The rest all acknowledge that so-called music is a "useless subject."</p>
<p>Although in recent years, the field of music in the country has gradually grown. In fact, there are more concerts of native-born musicians. Most recently, there are some specialized national schools solely devoted to music, that are barely satisfactory. We should thank some of the few exceptions among the second category of people I mentioned for this achievement, because the careers of these exceptions are worthy of our respect. Here, I will specifically mention Ms. Dong Wang Ruixian. After returning from the United States, Ms. Wang Ruixian has been engaged in her great career: music education. What we admire is that she is a certified music teacher in the United States and has served as a music professor in various schools and the National Conservatory of Music. Now, in addition to establishing her own Wang Ruixian Music Studio, she is still teaching at Jinan and other schools. Because she is dedicated to music education, I don't need to introduce her in detail, because from the talents she has cultivated, we can understand everything about her. This is obvious.</p>
<p>After listening to her first piano concert rehearsal, I further discovered the greatness of Ms. Wang's career, because she is not only engaged in general music education but also pays more attention to children's music education. The first part of the concert was entirely occupied by children, from six to eleven years old, each one innocent and lively, and their talent is even more worthy of praise. The neatness of the children's rhythm orchestra's performance made me think of the difficulty of training. However, our patient and dedicated person is not tired, because she feels very interested. She likes children.</p>
<p>She firmly believes that children are the masters of the future. She firmly believes that music can lead children into a beautiful world, express their unique personality, love the taste of creation, expand their sympathy, develop their wisdom, and comfort and purify their spirit, and increase the beauty of their body and mind.</p>
<p>Here, I cannot mention everything completely. Let's look at a few outstanding talents, because just these few are enough to amaze people.</p>
<p>Li Suxin (seven years old), she is just starting to learn the piano, but her skillful performance has already shown her full talent. You must believe this, because she has only been learning the piano for two full months.</p>
<p>Wang Peiyu (seven years old), I like her lively and innocent posture when she plays, as if she is really in the "First Waltz" that she is playing. Throughout the entire concert, I felt that her posture was the most charming, and thus I believed even more in the great power of music.</p>
<p>Dong Guangguang (six years old), Guangguang is Ms. Ruixian's daughter, just this sentence is self-evident. She is only six years old and has already played Sonatina. This is of course inherited from her mother's innate effect. You only need to press a certain black key on the piano, and she can tell you from the sound that this is C sharp or B flat.</p>
<p>Wu Leyi (eleven years old), Leyi is considered the largest among the children, so her performance is also very good. However, comparing her age to the average adult, she is fully worthy of the name of prodigy, because she has already played adult music. She played Weber's "Polonaise." I don't know what magic her little ten fingers have. She is fully a Virtuoso. However, I hope she will study theory as soon as possible, because we really hope for an Eastern female Mozart.</p>
<p>In the second part of the adult performance, I cannot say in detail. In short, they are all hardworking music lovers. Mrs. Xu Weiming said that she has only been learning the piano for half a year and has already achieved such results. The performances of the other ladies, Liu Huixian, Ma Xuruo, Li Yuhua, and Bao Kezhen, are all the result of inherent talent and diligent practice. These everywhere show the functions of their teachers.</p>
<p>Finally, Ms. Dong Yueli, who served as the rear guard, I cannot help but mention her ""A Flat Major Folk Song,"" which really moved people. Every movement of her fingers, every melody and chord that she played, expressed full emotion. Although she is not known because she does not pursue vanity, her skills are enough to compete with young ladies who only boast. Her precious point is because she is not a so-called "golden girl" but a working woman who desperately learns music in her spare time. Strangely enough, most of them are engaged in education and are also fascinated by music. There must be a life if there is a teacher.</p>
<p>Their concert will be held at 8:45 PM on Saturday, June 14th, at the Tian'an Church Club behind the Guanglu Grand Theater. At that time, the audience's applause will surely alarm the pedestrians on the Suzhou Creek.</p>
<p>The Drama Society Reruns</p>
<h3>The Merchant of Venice</h3>
<p>The Drama Society's performance of Shakespeare's famous play *The Merchant of Venice* last month won unanimous praise from the outside world, because its plot is tortuous, the scenery is magnificent, and the actors are all experienced veterans. All items such as lighting and props are perfect and all directed by the famous director Ying Yunwei, which is a perfect match. Although the location of the last performance was relatively remote, the audience did not give up because of this. It is heard that the society has scheduled to perform again on the 21st and 22nd of this month at the Dan Gui No. 1 Stage on the Fourth Road, both day and night.</p>
<p>Law School</p>
<h3>Law Research Society Gathering</h3>
<p>Regarding the news of the Law School Law Research Society, a considerable introduction has been made in this publication the day before yesterday. Of course, it can make all the students of the school have a deeper understanding of the society, and even in the minds of readers, at least a subtle impression must be left. It is not necessary to elaborate here. It is learned that the association held a gathering at 2 PM yesterday in the sixth classroom of the school. At the same time, the last general meeting of members of this semester was held, and the work plan for the next semester was discussed and decided on the spot, such as organizing special committees, lecture meetings, discussion meetings (political, legal, economic), etc.</p>
<p>The members were so organized that no one was absent. On the guest side, there were more than ten people including Ms. Liu, Ms. Zhao, Mr. Zhu, and Mr. Li. Zhang Mingjun served as the chairman of the meeting, and Zeng Zhaoji served as the recorder. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, saying that today is the day of the association's gathering, and it is also the last day of the association this semester. There are three more important points to report to you: (1) Although the association has been established for nearly a month, the work is not very remarkable, but it is worthwhile for the semester to have a meeting of all members in one hall to make a more detailed report to you. (2) The summer vacation is approaching, and we are bound to travel to various places. Although it is only a separation of more than two months, it is always human nature to cherish separation. Therefore, we have this meeting today, which is also a small commemoration for us. (3) Our daily life seems too dry except for burying ourselves in the case and working hard. Everyone rarely has the opportunity to get together, and since we are all wanderers in a vast foreign land, we feel that we should have this gathering today, which is also worth commemorating. Following this, Mr. Feng, a guest, gave a speech, which was so moving that it was shocking. Then, Mr. Wang Yuming, Ms. Jin Guangmei, and others spoke in succession. Ms. Jin's words were witty and sincere, truly "pearls of wisdom." Tea and refreshments began, and then there were more than ten kinds of entertainment performances, which were not prepared in advance, but reached more than ten kinds temporarily, which was not easy. The performances included Ms. Jin Guangmei's Peking opera, Ms. Lu Meifen's Kunqu opera, Ms. Liu Suxia's Peking opera, Mr. Zhou Yiwu's Peking opera, Ms. Wang Zhicheng's English song, Mr. Shen Deji and Mr. Zhang Ming</p>
<h2>Page 32</h2>
<p>Mr.'s Xiao and flute ensemble, Ms. Zhao Xiuhua's presentation, Ms. Han Jinxia's dialect performance, and Mr. Wen Yuegao's ventriloquism. Finally, Ms. Jin Guangmei and others sang and danced, which was extremely grand and lasted until 6:30 PM before the meeting was adjourned (Zhiyuan).</p>
<h3>The Public Performance of the Great Xia Drama Troupe Is Silent</h3>
<p>In the past two years, the atmosphere of the theatrical movement can be said to have expanded to the extreme, and the theatrical movement in schools has made special progress. Our Great Xia University is in this tense atmosphere, and some students who are interested in drama are naturally caught up in this climax. Although the school does not have a special drama department and does not hire drama professors to guide and promote it, thanks to the efforts of a group of drama-loving students for several years, it has occupied a considerable position in the entire drama movement and has gained considerable reputation in society.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Great Xia Drama Troupe, all those who love drama and care about the Great Xia Drama Troupe can always remember the Great Xia Drama Troupe's public performance of "Zi Jian Nan Zi" last year. After the Great Xia Drama Troupe performed "Zi Jian Nan Zi," it gained a lot of reputation, and people in society who loved drama also recognized the spirit of the troupe and expressed infinite hope.</p>
<p>As a result of their efforts, on the eleventh of this month, three plays were performed in the Great Xia Auditorium, namely "Until Tomorrow," "The Moon Rises," and "Thief," all of which were one-act plays. I will not introduce their plots. I only feel that their radical ideas seem to be chasing the so-called "fashion."</p>
<p>I certainly don't understand what the significance of the school drama movement is, nor do I know the due understanding of the selection of scripts for the school drama movement, but I at least feel that in modern Chinese schools, there seems to be no need to imply class struggle. The current crisis seems not to be social inequality, but the decline of clan consciousness. Now, the Chinese nation is precisely demanding an era of self-improvement. We must strive for the future of the entire nation. This is the need of the times, which is probably undeniable.</p>
<p>We are aware of the lack of national consciousness and the wilting of will of the general youth. Can't we see everywhere that the general youth are anesthetized by foreign ideas, forgetting that they are part of the Chinese nation, and acting as tools for others without realizing it? And can't we see everywhere the young people with the sickness of the century, who only know how to moan and lose heart when they encounter a little misfortune, and sink into a state of depression? Therefore, our school's drama movement should prescribe the right medicine, should seize this crux to make the goal of our school's drama movement, shoulder the due mission, and awaken the youth to recognize their nation and should cherish it, and awaken the youth's courage to move forward and recognize the bright path of life.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about the facts on the stage this time. After watching this public performance of the Great Xia Drama Troupe, what we got was only disappointment and sigh. Except for the play "Until Tomorrow," which was performed by the people of the Modern Society, during the performance of the remaining two plays, we only heard boos and giggles from the audience under the stage. This is probably to express their praise. In a scene of the second play, "The Moon Rises," the performance of this "person" was full of swaying hips and crooked heads, and full of oily tones, which was obviously like a clown in old dramas. However, in terms of the plot, what it tells us is that he is a revolutionary leader. I guess their so-called attitude of a revolutionary leader is like this. This time, the layout was hasty, the dialogue was vague, and even the lines were not proficient. When they encountered boos and cheers from the stage, they were flustered. In a scene of "Thief," they even forgot many of the plots and lines in the play. This really satisfied the audience too much. What do you, gentlemen of the Great Xia Drama Troupe, think?</p>
<h3>Only Afraid of Not Working Hard</h3>
<p>Jinan University Establishes Summer Athletics Training Class</p>
<p>After our country's failure in this Far Eastern Games, everyone knows that Chinese people are rice buckets and cannot be compared with others. As soon as they are compared, they are immediately embarrassed and pale in comparison. No wonder foreigners used to say that our people were all sick men. Fortunately, they are now one level higher and have become rice buckets. In the Far Eastern Games, our Chinese people have the greatest ability to eat, and other countries cannot catch up with us. It is really shameful, ashamed, and embarrassing. After this huge stimulation, as long as we never forget to work hard and refuel, one day we will be better than others.</p>
<p>Chinese youth are very stimulating and very competitive. I believe that in the future, there will be people with rapid progress and outstanding talents and achievements.</p>
<p>Now, the students of Jinan University, in view of the past failures, have established a summer athletics training class during the summer vacation and invited Mr. Wu Bangwei to guide them. They will spend the two months of the summer vacation to work hard and train. "Not afraid of heat, not afraid of death, just work hard" is their purpose.</p>
<p>If every public and private university can do this, the shame of this failure can be recovered immediately, and many other benefits can be obtained at the same time. As long as our modern youth have the two words "hard work" in their hearts. (An)</p>

Also, the Nanhai Party, on the grounds that Ciano and Mussolini are related by marriage through their daughters, requested the King of Italy to order Ciano to continue to hold political power.

<p>Zhenjiang Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Factory by Wen Daguan</p>
<p>(1) Factory Director Ge Jingzhong graduated from a French school. His wife also graduated from Suzhou Silkworm School. The couple is happy and tireless and willing to spend their lives here.</p>
<p>The China United Silkworm Improvement Association established a silkworm seed manufacturing factory in Zhenjiang in 1927. The area is mostly high hills, and the five grains do not grow well. It is most suitable for planting mulberry trees. To the east is Danyang, and to the west is the capital. There are no less than six million mu of uncultivated barren mountains. The association has purchased more than 3,000 mu, and the construction cost has reached more than 100,000 yuan. The total amount of spring and autumn silkworm seeds produced by the factory and branch factories has reached 200,000 sheets. The factory has an attached junior high school for girls. In the 19th year, with the assistance of the country and the province, a vocational school will be added to cultivate leading talents. Japanese public and private organizations that visit Zhenjiang every year are numerous. Seeing the fertile soil, the cheap land prices, and the comprehensive equipment, they are amazed. After returning to their country, they wrote in publications, "Terrifying Zhenjiang" to warn their people. However, our people have rarely paid attention to it. Our country was originally a pioneer in silk production, but due to the failure of human affairs, the production is less than one-tenth of that of Japan. How important is it to the people's livelihood? Now I will introduce the general situation of the factory to the people of the country. I hope that they can continue to work hard to restore China's lost silk industry status. (Bao Mingshu) (2) The Yonghe and Qimin factories affiliated to the general factory have capital of more than 100,000 each and are completely privately operated. They were just completed this spring and have now begun to produce seeds. Next to them is a blockhouse to prevent emergencies due to the unstable situation. (3) A part of the panoramic view of the factory site. The entire factory is built in a valley with lush trees, and the scenery is excellent with Wuzhou Mountain as the screen. It is 9 li away from the city, and a new road has been opened with public buses directly to it. (4) This year, the factory's spring silkworm ants weighed 48 taels and were divided into autumn seeds and original seeds, which can produce more than 50,000 sheets of seeds. This is a photo of female students picking cocoons and sending them to the seed production room. (5) The original seeds are raised separately in circles. This is a photo of the selection after the cocoons are formed. (6) A photo of the students of the vocational girls' middle school affiliated to the factory managing the mulberry fields.</p>
