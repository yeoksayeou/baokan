<p>時評</p>
<h3>軍縮籌委會又將開幕</h3>
<p>世界事表面與底裏不符。未有能獲良果者。如今日各國。一方盛倡縮軍。主張和平。一方則又實行擴張軍備。作反和平之運動。所謂表面與底裏不符。未有甚於此事者也。</p>
<p>然其所以不符之故。果如意相墨索里尼所謂人類僞善之表現。一切縮軍和平等口號。皆爲虚詐乎。則又非也。時勢與事實所驅迫。不能不出此兩歧之現象也。各國之財政困難。旣同出一轍。而黨政相爭。政局不安。又爲普通現象。處此困境。非特無人敢稍生好戰之野心。且恐他人有好戰而急思所以消弭之。</p>
<p>故今日之議减軍倡和平者。必皆出於眞心誠意者也。然而就事實論。自倡議軍縮以來。迭次會議。皆以環境之牽制而無所成就。最近倫敦會議。裂痕愈顯。國聯會議。又無合作機會。猜疑顧忌之心益甚。則擴張軍備之念。愈不能免。故今日各國滿布反和平空氣。亦係事實而非虚言也。</p>
<p>在此兩相矛盾之形勢中。懼戰之念。恐終不敵事實之壓迫。和平將愈陷於危險。此軍縮籌委會之所以又亟謀進行也。但此次之軍縮籌委會。包括陸空軍在内。較倫敦會議之僅議海軍者。關係更鉅。糾紛更多。倘於事實上仍不能得一深切之諒解。則縮軍之會議。終將成爲擴軍而已。其於和平有奚益哉。</p>

<h3>十九年國慶紀念感言（陳銘樞）</h3>
<p>先總理手創之中華民國、於今又到十九週年了、在總理和烈士們、費了多少的心血、經歷了多久的時間、才使我中華民族解放於滿清專制之下、而建立了五族統一的共和國家、及後由總理之領導、國人之奮鬥、又經歷偌大之犧牲、方才能保持國命與國體以至於今日、吾人當茲莊嚴燦爛之紀念、首當以至誠至敬之心、對先總理和烈士們之豐功偉烈、加以深切的認識和景念、同時又對於我堂皇簇新之民國、革命策源之廣東、又當如何的表示歡喜與愛重、</p>
<p>國人每有兩種相反的心理、有痛心過去而樂觀現在者、有悲觀現在而慕念過去者、際茲十九年來政變之頻繁、戰禍之連延、民生之憔悴、國勢之不振、其懷第二種心理者、甚至有謂新國不如勝朝、革命不如守舊、此蓋昧於歷史演進與國家情勢之淺論、要知我中華民族、由數千年之專制與閉關、忽然開放門户、推倒帝制、乃爲國史上至激烈之變化、亦爲一至艱鉅之變化、於此至激烈至艱鉅之變化、自不免更須忍受相當之苦痛、才能獲得較美滿之幸福、而此苦痛與幸福之替換、要在我國人努力之爲如何耳、</p>
<p>即以十九年之經過而論、以國人之不能克盡其國民之職責、故致有袁氏之帝制自爲、以國人之不能克盡其國民之職責、故致有軍閥之專政、中期雖經歐戰之機會、而工商業亦不得隨日本以俱進、在農業且趨於衰落之景象、中期雖值世界普遍之要求解放、而不平等條約、仍不得廢除、在日本更肆其獨佔之野心、此十餘年來所受殘餘封建勢力與帝國主義者之禍害、在其背景與環境、固多惡劣之障碍、然溯其要因、亦由於我國人放任被動之態度、因襲舊日望治承恩之心理、不能自主自助、羣策羣力、有以致之也、</p>
<p>迨至民國十三年以來、一般人民、始漸漸感動於總理爲國之誠、認識總理謀國之志、相率信服總理之主義、接受總理之方略、我國民革命軍、爲主義爲革命以戰、肅清廣東、北伐軍閥、自我國民政府、建立粤中、遷都南京、凡此匪特創我國歷史上所未有之局面、抑亦爲民國存亡中興復振之關鍵、幸而卒以人民之贊助、將士之奮勇、舉凡北洋軍閥之頑敵、共產黨徒之叛亂、皆得以掃蕩廓清、而再見民國一統之盛况、</p>
<p>然自三年前統一以還、結束軍事、開始訓政、理應循序漸進、計日程功、又何至比年以來、戰事愈演而愈激、叛亂此伏而彼起、災祲疊見、萑苻遍地、重以金貴銀賤之影響、物價騰貴、民生彫敝、致令吾人民陷於不能忍受之苦境、考其禍因、厥爲殘餘封建勢力之大敵、彼馮閻唐桂張諸逆、因襲軍閥之謬念、復受政客之潘弄、甘爲戎首、破壞統一、使旣定之局、轉爲危亂、待蘇之民、重陷溝壑、諸逆背叛革命、其所禍害於黨國者爲何如哉、</p>
<p>夫建國之方、總理所昭示於吾人者、至爲詳確、匪經濟建設、無以植國基、匪政治建設、無以定國勢、政治之建設、首在鞏固國家之統一、保持國家之和平、庶然後循法守制納於正軌、庶然後訓民以政、確立基礎、此法治與民主之政治、固爲我國人現在所急欲求得之者、然而民主不能與軍閥並立、法治不能與私人之武力同存、必先使武力爲國家之武力、然後始有法治之可言、必先使人民不受軍閥之宰割、然後方見民主之力量、故統一之基本條件、即在武力不爲私人之所有、和平之基本條件、即在國無軍閥之倡亂、二者蓋相互聯貫、一而二二而一者也、</p>
<p>幸而當茲十九年國慶日之紀念、彼破壞統一與和平之叛逆已見其日趨於消滅矣、我民國之豐年亦已見朕兆之來臨矣、目前急待解决之問題、應如何肅清各地匪患、以使民安居樂業、社會得安定之日子、應如何編遣軍隊、以减輕國家之負擔、財政得整理之機會、應如何防止反動、以保長久之治安、國家得建設之進展、吾人固期望中央之善能因時利導、濟難政治、然尙須我國人一致奮起、羣策羣力、以共圖之共享之者也、</p>

<h3>此番遠征擱淺的遠因近果（一）余衡之</h3>
<p>揚着「遠征」的旗號和抱着環遊歐美的壯志那艘輪船、現在已中途擱淺了、將來能否把他從險戯的灘上拖了出來、繼續他未了的航程、完成他未達的志願、却是大大的一個疑問、</p>
<p>我是遠征主動者之一、對於遠征的經過情形、是比較他人明瞭得多、這次擱淺的原因、當然也瞭若觀掌、不過、在初我以爲此番的事實、多由李君惠堂的日記和其他文字裏披露了出來、重複的解釋是可免則免、所以我起首還抱着噤若寒蟬、徐圖後策的宗旨、</p>
<p>但是、最近遠征隊返滬後、却引起了各界的非常注意、兼且扯起了無限的是非、三兩日前、還勞動了熱心體育的徐振東君說了一大篇似是而非的話、因此、爲免着擁護體育界的人們疑雲滿腹起見、和求着眞是非的流露無遺、我現在索性從首至尾、把這番的事實和盤托出、</p>
<p>欲求各界明瞭一點、我於是先從過征的動機開始說起、</p>
<p>我記得從前也曾給外界知過了、遠征的動機、是遠在四年前的、那駐滬的軍醫隊裏有一位哈利士先生、他同時也是出席上海足球總會的代表、他和樂華的感情也非常容洽、後來他奉調歸國了、適值那年一九二八樂華的成績非常優異、獲了甲組常年盾和甲級杯的兩項冠軍、所以他老人家在臨别之際、曾說過一定設法使樂華有遊歐的機會、（請閱者注者、是樂華遊歐而非中國隊、）</p>
<p>他果然在英國活動起來了、他而且和英倫足球總會的幹事窩路爵士合作、在英倫方面四處幹旋、最後還到歐洲各國去奔走、直到了去年、各事漸漸有些眉目了、富樂華初征爪哇、師出泗濱之時、他居然發電來邀、並且說首次比賽、已定在奥京維也納了、後來我們商議在那忽忙的當兒、甚麽事都未有充分的預備、想從那裏出征歐洲、是萬萬不能的一件事、結果、我們覆電婉辭、並聲明我們的理由、最後且答應他返滬後即事籌備、預備來年出發、</p>
<p>素和中國足球界有關係的李思廉先生、今春適從英國假遊返申、伊在英因着樂華的事件、曾和哈利士商酌了很多的辦法、所以後此的來往的電信、總是從伊經手、延至今年四月、雙方接洽到很滿意的田地、英國和歐洲方面、已答應每塲有相當的保證金、照我們的預算計起了、如果有三十塲的比賽、保證金之數、便可和費用之數相抵、</p>
<p>最大的經濟問題解决了、於是我們馬上籌備其他的事、在初、我們原想純粹用樂華實力去對付、後來覺得實力上總有弱點、同時港報也有懇切的評論說論要加厚戰鬥力方爲上策、於是我們遂决意採取最優等人材、而把樂華的名字、改作華人遠征足球隊、（並非中國代表隊、望勿誤會、）</p>
<p>華人球隊外征、想各界早知已有先行者了、我們本着有例可循的宗旨做去、照舊的和各個球員私人接洽、很簡單而合理的待遇、也由樂華會内酌定和一九二七年征澳隊的辦法一樣、我們和球員私人接洽、是憑着兩個理解、（甲）前時澳行也是私人的接洽、澳行順遂、自應循例爲妙、（乙）我們覺着在本國的球員、統是業餘運動家、他們的行動是有自由權、是不受任何會社所轄制的、（未完）</p>

<h3>國貨運動大會閉幕花絮錄</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>上海市第三届國貨運動會。因九日舉行之時裝展覽會。偏重女界。未能盡顯國綢之優點。故又羅致全國精美綢緞。於月之十三日行閉幕禮時。復借市商會陳列展覽。不用門票。任人參觀。詳情業誌本報。茲將花絮補誌於後。</p>
<p>上海市商會大門口。黨國旗成交叉形。懸有紅綢金字横額。文曰「上海市第三届國貨運動週國產綢緞展覽會」旁立保衛團及巡士各四人。全副武裝。精神煥發。甬道兩旁。遍貼圖畫標語。有畫火車道。分生路與絶路任人自擇者。有書洋貨輸入其禍等於洪水。并繪數人陷入水内而垂斃者。閱之令人觸目驚心。石梯旁設簽到處。來賓簽名後。均分送宣傳印刷品多種。議事廳前曁三層樓各走廊。陳列各廠出品。并標以某廠出品。每尺價值。及綢緞名稱等令人一望而知。會塲内來賓座位。分樓上樓下兩處。台上懸源源衣莊所製之國產綢緞禮服兩套。男左女右。一則藍袍黑褂。一則綉花衫褲。咸支以竹架。如衣莊之招牌然。開會時。直立總理遺像下之主席團。均穿簇新藍袍玄褂而胸佩大紅徽章。如新郎然。上海市綢緞業同業公會曁中華國產綢緞上海救濟會。將民國十八年四月十六日國民政府公佈之中華民國服制條例。全文三章九條。刋成傳單。上冠三寸見方之「衣」字。并註不用國貨。便要亡國等語。分送來賓。可謂别開生面。先達勝達緯綸三駱駝絨廠。亦聯合印有紅字宣言。附有國產嗶嘰樣品一方。在塲分送。潘公展致開會詞時。除勸來賓服用國貨外。并希望到會者咸負宣傳任務。謂散會後。諸君如遇親友。請勸其以後衣料。槪購國貨。王延松代表綢緞業報告。以國貨與外貨。比擬親生子與他人兒。謂不用國貨而購外貨。不啻不愛自己所生子女而反愛鄰人之子女。語淺近而透澈。人皆頷首。范爭波演說。以提倡國貨之責任。商家最重。如一致不進外貨。則人民欲購洋貨亦無由購處。是亦釜底抽薪之一法。王曉籟演說。直立台口。雙手背負。一種鐵面無私之態度。如唱黑頭戲之包公然。聲若洪鐘。聽者動容。葉惠鈞演說。向以滑稽著名。是日仍操浦東語。謂中國人民佔全地球四分之一。如能一德一心。抱定外國人以洋貨奉送而不發脚錢。則三年後不國富民强者。鄙人可擔負賠償損失之責任。并謂倘仍購用外貨。利權外溢。恐外人非特不知感激。且將以中國人爲蠟燭。（滬人駡人語。）令人捧腹。五時後。將各廠所贈衣料等品。編列號碼。陳列於三樓常會室。在門房内售劵。每劵半元。每人限購一劵。均有贈品。抽籤室設於三樓會客廳。因來賓二千餘劵。僅四百三十。不敷分配。故擁擠不堪。最後殿以陸嘯梧張冶兒易方朔王無能等游藝。突梯滑稽中。能將提倡國貨意旨。包含在内。頗有深意。潘公展始終坐於台上。笑逐顏開。甚形得意。張振遠在台上照料。手持傳音筒。大聲疾呼。報告節目而兼維秩序。甚爲忙碌。散會時。已萬家燈火矣。</p>
<h3>秋訊</h3>
<p>— 鄭曼青</p>
<p>余自去冬與同人　創辦中國藝專學校於楓林橋畔。苦爲校務嬰人。以致良朋契闊。海内舊交。責余過於稽懶者。積書盈篋。同居海上而不相晤者。亦動輙數月。或疑余遠涉重洋。或疑余入林已密。而不知余研朱殺粉。歲月長忘。無何明月撩人。秋光又半。一尊獨酌。萬感叢生。人言酒可消愁。未解愁能勸酒。嘯歌中夜。大半懵騰。忽於不知不覺中。翫月忘倦。閒翻舊籍。得一小箋。余驚視之。乃昔年陳飛公詞宗。贈玉霜簃遺詩八首。玉霜簃者。今名伶程艶秋之别字也。飛公於癸亥冬入燕京。見余詩畫。頗承稱賞。余或有疑義處質之。未有不析者。時余友羅　公爲艶秋譜曲。遭余於畹華座間。識艶秋不多時。艶秋幽靜少言。舉止有度。初見之。似不信其善爲歌舞。惟飛公每一道及。必贊嘆不置。厥後余與飛公同往聽劇。翩婉龍鴻。鏗鏘珠玉。始信名下果無虚士。今艶秋重來滬。而羅陳二公俱已長逝。嗚呼。癭公乃艶秋知己。飛公亦可謂艶秋之知己者矣。夫以飛公之才之豐。而乃嗇於遇。浮沈宦海數十年。鬱鬱不得志。日流連於歌舞之塲。借詩酒以自遣。觀其贈玉霜簃之詩。其哀艶沈痛之意。溢於言表。其殆古之傷心人歟。今者艶秋來。而其詩偶然發見。何若是其巧也。豈非飛公之精靈不泯乎。余故亟作秋訊一篇。以介海上慕艶秋之名者。不可不知艶秋之實。故略序其梗槪云爾。其詩曰。絶代風神絶代歌。美男今覺勝嬌娥。非因曲筆伶官傳。王謝家兒自足多。玉骨天然霜下杰。風流顚倒盡時賢。爲傾地老天荒淚。一箇俠佳美少年。（有人謂玉霜曰。飛公頗動宦情。玉霜笑曰。飛公十三年。不曾作官。但好禪佛。此行此來。或專爲佛事來耶。嗚呼。玉霜可謂知言。）囊佩傳家小印雙。青門爲庶亦尋常。風花易感興亡痛。鴉亂觚稜又夕陽。凝碧何心奏管弦。當歌隨分使人憐。是兒獨得江山俊。風義還應領後賢。（癭公死後。貧不能舉喪。玉霜哭之痛。力任之。）略遣恩讐到酒邊。婉歌嬌舞竟通禪。迴鐙更反桃花淚。花外天魔已悟玄玉霜演紅拂傳。武夫列觀者甚多。有一尊者獨拭淚。）退席摩登費慧思。殘梅蘦落牡丹遲。霜天秦月空霄凈。獨見黃花玉一枝。海上周郎有俊哀。（謂梅泉）徵歌譽汝一奇才。山陽聞笛思羅隱。（謂癭公）不見驚鴻照水來。終是陶家秋色艶。疎籬芳潔義熙花。拈花笑擬閒情賦。一任龍天八部譁。</p>
<h3>八堡雙潮</h3>
<p>— 劉恨我自杭寄</p>
<p>秋潮澎湃。夙著之江。惟觀衆之目標。多舍此而羣趨海寗。一飽眼福。多嘆觀止。不知尙有八堡在。東南雙潮。更爲大觀。然距海寗之東約二十里之遙。地猶偏僻。寂然無聞。中國旅行社杭州分社有鑒於斯。今歲特組八堡觀潮團。以是萬千觀衆多歸之。社友婁薇紅。曾先往一探。驚而相告。吾亟願一覩爲快。中秋後三日。方擬約慕潔君同行未果。又以額滿見遺。幸商諸該社經理李鏡如君。慇懃讓坐。始附車往。觀衆四百餘。車發五十輛。前後相接。貫若長蛇。杭海道上。沿途地勢較高。風景歷歷在目。銀塘白帆。霜楓紅葉。盡收眼底。如展畫圖。十一時達目的地。曼步海塘。縱目四矚。陽光普照。鱗影波心。潮未湧。人先潮湧矣。迨十二時二十分。人聲鼎沸。翹首凝神。遙見東南白芒。悠悠而起。線合如弧。銀濤滾滾。由遠而近。厥聲如千軍萬馬。南潮乍退。湍流競逐。東潮繼至。接觸奮壓。抨擊激盪。洶湧奔騰。恰若羣虎撲人之勢。潮衝石塘。排奮而上。繼又狂翻。凌空掀天。如雪山傾瀉。銀崖崩潰。約有三丈之高。觀衆爲之寒心。紛相走避。稍一落後。衣履盡濕。予冒險急攝一影。僅沾餘波。亦云幸矣。目送洪濤。萬里回流。興闌歸途。擁擠塞道。潮聲人影。瞬息而逝。又將期諸明年今日矣。</p>

<h3>心上温馨（二九五）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十四回　翠竹淚斑伊人腸斷　紅蓮香褪有女魂離</p>
<p>自傭人們而漸漸及到家裏帳房先生。自帳房先生而及到大少爺二少爺。因爲那種事。最足資人談助。無論那一個故事。無論那一齣戲文裏。只要有個女人在裏面。平添了多少的興趣。老爺在外面討了姨太太。借了小公館。這是何等香艶而驚人的新聞呢。所以家人們常常以此作爲題材。算一種討論的資料。單只瞞過了雌老虎一人。因爲家中人没有一個不怕伊。倘然被伊知道了。便要掀起絶大風波。誰擔這個責任呢。因此凡是他們喞喞噥噥。正在談起這件事的當兒。忽然看見太太來了。連忙大家屏息無聲。太太却也不免有些起疑了。爲什麽正在談論一件事的時候。見了我來。就停止了呢。這事一定有些蹊蹻。莫不是要瞞我的嗎。旣然稱伊爲雌老虎。自然是妒心很重的。妒心很重的人。也就是疑心很重的。伊疑心到他們總是在講伊的壞話。不過也始終没有偵探到是什麽事。不過也覺得老爺近來的行止不對。有一天。太太下午要出去買東西。預先給老爺說了。說你出去以後。把馬車放回來。我要去買一點東西。老爺自然不敢違背。到了自己的號裏。便吩咐根生把馬車放回去。太太要去買東西咧。根生到了家裏。格外討好。走到太太外房。見了阿金。忘其所以。便道。老爺呌我把馬車放回來。說大太太要出去買物事咧。這一句話根生出自無心。却被太太在房裏聽得了。連忙趕出來說道。根生。你說什麽。那裏有個什麽大太太要出去買物事。根生道。不是。我說太太要出去買物事。太太道。你不用抵賴。分明說是大太太。就呌我大太太。又有什麽要緊呢。可是你的馬脚。今天露出來了。原來這位殷老爺。把蓮香討在外面。要想見好於蓮香。凡蓮香自己所用的人。並不稱呼姨太太。一槪稱爲太太。像馬車夫根生之類。是大公館小公館兩面跑的人。也一槪稱爲太太。似乎無所區别。於是他自出心裁。將大公館裏的太太。稱之爲大太太。小公館裏的太太。稱之爲二太太。就這樣的呌呌。倒也呌順了口咧。可是你這種稱呼。只可以在背後叫叫。到了當面。却不能憑你自己的心思。加上那種銜頭。他却呌順了口。在無意之中。無大不大的加上了一個大字。露出了那個馬脚來了。</p>

<h3>外匯市略見秀象</h3>
<p>昨海外銀市復低、匯兌則升、匯豐掛牌、各匯槪無變更、惟内盤似乎見緊、但無過於生色、自早趨鋒、以後則鬆、因金市回挫故耳、午後尙屬平穩、金市雖漲、然不爲所動、因銀行方面、賣意不怠、殆逢標金掉期、而十二月份上場矣、匯票似乎異趣焉、迨結果比較前天計英金略縮零六二五、美金縮一二五、日金加六二五、華商金業中前抛後扒、交易尙多、計英金成交廿餘萬鎊、前市由大通匯豐有利安達等買進、後市華比三井麥加利住友等均有售出、係恒興等購進套回條子也、又各行互做數萬鎊、又美金亦對做廿萬元、恒興等扒結二十萬元、運通華比住友等賣出也、惟朝鮮稍進、又日金交易、仍屬淡漠、僅少數結進、而三井則售出、綜之匯市尙可站定、或有盤旋之局云、</p>

<h3>江河日下之洋厘</h3>
<p>▲市場槪况　昨日洋市殊疲、而早午間市價因之遞次低落、據業中推測、照目前軟勢、一時難望轉機、雖有花米需求、然因時勢惡劣、途次運輸危險、故一般内地商賈多有彼此劃賬者、對於洋欵之需要、當然難殷、且現在軍事已告結束、軍需亦乃中輟、宜其有回落之氣象耳、</p>
<p>▲厘拆價格　（洋厘）早市爲七錢二分六厘、較前日午市之低盤又小六毫二忽半、午市更疲、結果又跌六毫二忽半、爲七錢二分五厘三毫七忽半、照此情形、大有江河日下之勢、（銀拆）早午兩市皆開五分、較前日亦小一分、劃頭加水由二三分而至白劃、亦與前日相埓、銀行掛牌仍無市價、</p>
<p>▲輔幣市情　江南小洋早午市同爲六錢四分五厘、而交易早市六千角、午市四千角、廣東小洋早市爲六錢三分六厘、午市爲六錢三分五厘半、做出交易早市十七萬五千角、午市七萬角、客路來源五六萬角、銅元驟長三千五百文、爲三百九十三千五百文、</p>

<h3>證劵公債市清閒靜定</h3>

<h3>紗花紗市陡呈緊張勢</h3>

<h3>棉市無多大起色</h3>
<p>棉市平靜、趨勢仍弱、實以世界棉市不佳、各廠印美兩棉大量吃飽、華棉交易杜絶、據漢訊紗市花價跌一元外、標準貨來滬合價、則須三十兩左右、故一部份漢帮套賣期貨、惟内地帮吸進、仍不放鬆、日商仍係做空、但東棉洋行忽扒忽抛、捉摸不定云、</p>

<h3>糧食米市跌勢又烈</h3>
<p>▲閘北　昨日各帮來源四十餘號、市銷一蹶不振、新粳市形又跌、普通貨計短半元左右、眞眞特别頂粳現開十六元三角、情况仍須再跌耳、薄稱到旺銷呆、回落三四角、高貨十四元五六角、羊秈去化益不發展、兼之河存漸厚、買氣沉寂、杜尖到源陸續、零拆稍有問津、產訊續告軟化、以上價格悉跌三四角、市况極疲、埠尖價較底廉、故店胃尙殷、情形微軟而已、客尖小去一角、交易不多、惟來源似手轉稀也、白元陳貨銷淡欠佳、兼有新貨軋脚、因此跌去兩角許、新變元各銷活動、但貨屬零星、行情開十五元零、新陰元到貨日旺、價格回小三四角、高貨開十四元一角、</p>
<p>▲滬南　昨日河到三十餘號、本街走銷不一、新粳回風漸烈、常帮頂貨開十六元關口、大盤約小三角之譜、蘇同帮貨因受日米之軋脚、人心極軟、按抵申之日米、貨品與同里米相彷而售、價聞祗十元左右、是洋銷場不化、價格續短兩三角、南帮窰種百哥等稻到頭陸續、各方進胃清淡、價隨大勢下游一兩角不等、羊杜尖走銷帶爽、交易略旺、但行情則須疲去角左也、廠機尖高貨開十元零七八角、市况平庸、變元此間存到均少、故尙盤旋於十六元左右耳、</p>
<h3>粉市仍在狂瀉中</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份依然一致狂落、以洋麥報價、雖見微好二三角、惟市塲人心、仍虚弱異常、因本月份客帮旣無巨大胃口、廠家之籌碼、自然順從環境、愈加愈多、更以前月份之一部份棧單、决須回籠交出、客户又未接受、人心之疲、自覺更甚、至遠期局面、亦以大廠家因再堅擯、連日暢出、所傳之澳洲麥、聞已有一批定成、（外間則傳係俄國麥說亦相近）致外行多頭、紛紛脫手、故市勢亦步落不已也、結果本月份較前日跌三分二厘半、十一十二月份跌三分、正二三月份跌二分七厘半云、</p>
<h3>遠月麥再告暴跌</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份呈近平遠跌之態、本月份因日來到源轉寂、市上所有之貨、低次居多、與交易所之標準身分、均不相合、故多頭尙能站住、至遠期各月份、以洋麥之現貨行市、步步合划、且因過剩之餘、紛紛謀輸出、致各月份之内地多頭、祗好割愛了結、未願再檳、又此遂又暴落不已、結果本月份較前日小一分、十一月份跌九分、十二月份跌六分、正月份跌七分、二三月跌八分、現麥市面、依然沉寂、惟高貨甚少、低次亦跟蹤標準、步落甚銳、昨開明光·管店麥均爲四兩一錢、計一千包、由阜豐辦去云、</p>

<h3>復興内河航輪第一聲</h3>
<p>近二年來、本埠内河航輪、可爲衰落已極、停班休航者紛紛、自八月分經浙江建設廳航政局接管招商内河輪局後、由處長陳順通等積極整理、兩月以來、停者復業、無者添班、外則擴張營業、内又刷新制度、久無生氣之内河輪、頓現蓬勃之象、茲將新組織及其擴展情形、分記如下、</p>
<p>▲改定名稱　浙建廳接管該局之始、原名航政局、承租招商内河輪、嗣以範圍太狹、由航政局議定、將承租二字廢除、改爲浙江航政局内河輪局管理處、同時又加一招商内河輪局營業處、用此兩種名義、業經呈准浙省政府備案、而各局牌號、亦已更定矣、</p>
<p>▲内部組織　新局組織、由處長陳順通、會同航政局長孫云霄訂定、總局内設總理經理、直轄業務股·會計股·總務股·各分局·各包綫·及各船、業務股下設客票·裝貨·報關·稽查·及棧務五室、總務股下·設文牘·物料·航務·機務·四室、會計股下、設出納·簿記·覆核·統計·四室、從十月分起、新組織已成立矣、</p>

<p>▲代客報稅　内河輪之蘇申一路、全賴運貨、蘇貨裝申、以茶葉毛骨最多、向來每件綠茶、須納稅一兩二錢半、毛骨納五兩餘、現爲發展土貨計、由局向蘇關交涉、茶稅統减納六錢二分半、毛骨納一兩五、即其他各貨稅、亦由局代辦、客家以成本减輕、手續又簡、故紛紛向該局請裝、申蘇一路之營業、已占第一位矣、</p>

<p>▲慘遭滅頂　李秀寳所登臨者、係第三號礬水池、深約六尺、李旣入水、因不諳游泳、片時間即沉入池底、該廠職員立命工人入水撈救、以池深、逾十分鐘始行救起、已奄奄一息、不省人事、施以人工呼吸、亦未見效、乃車送上海醫院多方施救、毫無挽回之餘地、在院畢命、死者年祇十五歲、南京人、平時品性馴良、勤攻學業、故同級學生得其死耗後、莫不感傷異常、擬擇期開會追悼、</p>

<p>書報介紹</p>
<h3>前鋒月刊</h3>
<p>— 高偉</p>
<p>創刋號</p>
<p>前鋒月刋社編輯　現代書局出版</p>
<p>我們企望的「前鋒月刋」終於在雙十節日出版了、這又是民族主義文藝運動的一枝生力軍、</p>
<p>自民族主義文藝運動在本年六月一日發動了後、民族主義的文藝刋物、最初出版的是「前鋒周報」、發行以來、差不多已有兩三個月的歷史了、他們爲擴充而增厚這運動的力量的表現和謀更進一層的深入、就增加了這「前鋒月刋」、所以這「前鋒月刋」的誕生、也可以說即是形成民族主義文藝之潛勢力的推進、而一步步爲民族主義文藝建築着鞏固的基礎、</p>
<p>這期「前鋒月刋」創刋號的文字、大槪可歸納爲二類、就是理論和小說、這裏想擇其主要的約略來介紹、</p>
<p>第一、關於理論的、</p>
<p>大槪的民族主義文藝的理論、已散見在「前鋒周報」、最近又彚集成「民族主義文藝論」、這裏的幾篇大都是屬於旁徵這一方面、</p>
<p>要知道、「前鋒月刋」之所以在十月十日出版、也是有深切的意義的、華興的「認識我們的十月十日」、就是解說給我們了、十月十日在歷史上的價值、是我們中華民族全體民衆翻身的紀念、所以我們對國慶日之所以鼓舞歡欣、熱烈的慶祝、是說明中國民衆已經表示出民族運動的認識和從幾千年專制政下得到解放的愉快、但是雖經過了民國元年的十月十日、而一直下來、封建勢力却依然囂張、造成軍閥統治的局面、阻礙民族運動的進展、這我們可以明白、民族主義的運動是和封建的制度思想、形成水火不相容的仇敵的、在民族主義所要求的、封建的制度思想却正相反、因之民族主義的要求、完全給封建的制度思想破壞了、於是十月十日的偉大的意義與價值爲封建的制度思想摧殘了、其次、中國民衆的心理與習慣、因爲幾千年專制政體的關係、至今還包含着濃厚的封建的色彩、因之家族主義至今還支配了全中國、因爲家族主義勝利、於是民衆只要維持家族的安全、就不再關心民族前途的一切問題、所以十月十日旣是從家族主義大大地踏前一步到民族主義的紀念節、被家族主義所包圍的民衆對於十月十日當然不能有深刻的認識了、「但是我們應該知道現在這個時代不是從前的閉關時代、閉關時代是國内家族與家族的競爭、現在這個時代、是世界上民族與民族的競爭、……所以現在這個這個時代、家族主義已不夠作我們生活的中心、我們不得不以民族主義做我們生活的中心的了、旣欲以民族主義做我們的生活的中心、那末我們對於民族主義運動開始成功的十月十日、應當格外認識清楚、格外尊重、我們每逢這十月十日、要查察我們自己的力量、要運用我們的力量、來完成我們偉大的民族主義的運動、」也就是每逢十月十日、我們要查察我們的民族主義文藝運動所造成的潛勢力的影響、尤其這誕生於雙十節的「前鋒月刋」、</p>
<p>五卅慘案是帝國主義者對於中華民族的空前的大屠殺、凡是稍有血性的、對着這中華民族空前的民族運動、全中國民衆發揮民族主義的第一聲、莫不如醉如痴般狂熱、這種一致起來反抗帝國主義的大運動、但當時在文藝上的影響如何呢、這裏李猛的「五卅慘案在文藝上的影響及其批判」便是討論這問題的「自然像五卅這麽一個空前的大屠殺、……我們的文學界必然要受着極强烈的影響的、不論我們的文學者是怎樣地逍遙於象牙之塔、怎樣地卑陋無聊、上海的一般文士、住在這個慘案的發生地的文士、雖則没有目覩當日慘殺的情景至少他們是看見民衆如何狂吼的、人情如何激昻的、他們受着的刺激與影響、當然更爲强烈、他們所以也如學生工人一樣、憤怒的感情立時就會爆發起來了、」作又都一一指出那些文人所發表着的作品、最後判斷地說、「這些是屢於作品的表現、當的關於文藝的中心意識、也有人意識地想爲中國文藝找一條出路、有的把忸怩的所關宏旨的杼情詩反對了、而要求壯烈的文學、有的意識地提倡國民文學、可惜找來的這些出路、不是坦蕩蕩的大道、郤是羊腸曲徑、以致中國的混亂文藝界、直到現在還是混亂、這實在是非常可惜的、可惜我們的文藝者旣没有看清五卅的本體、又没有探索文藝的使命與史實、趁一時的情感來創作、來唱導理論、結果當然一無所得、混亂可悲的文藝界、仍然是個混亂可悲的文藝界、坐使一個提倡的族主義文藝的良機飛去、直到現在、還須從頭做起民族主義的文藝運動來、」</p>
<p>葉秋原的「世界民族藝術之發展、」是把現代世界民族文藝思潮的傾向加以總和、作者首將各國現代藝術的主潮詳細地分析、如法蘭西的立體主義及其後的純粹主義、日耳曼的表現主義、意大利的未來主義、俄羅斯的原始主義、此外如勾牙利、英吉利、巨哥斯拉夫等而發現在這些潮流的背後、我們都看見有整個民族的站立、現代藝術之所以爲民族藝術、作者說得非常的透闢詳明、</p>
<p>楊民威的「中國的建築與民族主義一文、」很是值得注意的、建築是一種外形的藝術、因之建築物的構成、的確與民族精神有莫大的關係、我們要研究建築史、便不得不承認民族精神的發揚、便是建築的進展、建築作風的進展與特創、實有賴於民族精神和主義、這裏作者舉「薩那遜建築」爲例而證實之、並且及將世界上各民族的建築物、闡明與民族精神的關係、接着作者討論到中國的建築物、而寫成第二節的「中國建築史的鳥瞰」從有巢氏構木爲巢說起、凡是歷代的建築、都收集來了、第三節便歸入到「民族主義與中國的建築的將來」、作者對於目下的全歐化半歐化不歐化這三派建築物都表示反對、而要以民族主義及民族精神爲中心、爲中國的建築物開闢一條出路、作者並將民族主義建築物的材料、條件、原則都有具體的規定、是值得我們去仔細探討的、</p>
<p>第二、屬於小說的、</p>
<p>這期的小說共有四篇、一篇是譯作、一二篇是短篇創作、一篇是長篇創作、爭波的「秀兒」據說是十多萬字的長篇、本期僅載一二兩節、故且等登完了再說、</p>
<p>和辻哲郎的「德漠斯呐司的没落」、用筆很清新、且爲獨具風格的、這是描寫政治上的行動的故事、用演說的體制宣達以來、譯者陳抱一、譯筆非常明潔、</p>
<p>心因的「野玫瑰」、在大體上是收到部份的成功的、這是寫諸曁農民消滅孫傳芳隊伍的故事、以革命爲經、戀愛爲緯、以野玫瑰的三角戀愛的激動來完成他們革命的勝利、是喜劇同時是悲劇、</p>
<p>野玫瑰是一個卡門式的女子、她不喜歡荏弱的男子、「…你自己没有胆量、你自己應該曉得、你要曉得、阿玫所愛的男子、只有是强健的、大胆的、勇敢的、這是她的性格、誰也不能勉强她、從前、牠愛阿榮、她是因爲他很强健、很大胆、很勇敢的一個男子、但是、現在這一個夢她已經打破了、打破得乾乾凈凈」、這或許即是我們所要發揚的民族性、我們相信戀愛絶對是有條件的、而這條件就應該像阿玫那樣、</p>
<p>易康的「勝利的死」是寫他的父親的事跡、使我們讀了不啻喝着興奮劑、不但知道西藏西康一帶漢族和蠻族的情况、並且知道帝國主義者在那裏是那樣地挑撥煽動着和想染指侵略的野心、其次、也可知道在邊疆的兵士和長官是那樣沉湎昏庸、他的父親是優秀的份子、以小小一個營長、竟爲民族而犧牲、獲得他底勝利之死、</p>
<p>這二篇創作的思想都是能把握了民族主義的武器的、描寫都非常有力、在這時候能有這樣有力的創作、眞是難能可貴的、</p>
<p>此外尙有易康的「黑人詩歌中民族意識之表現」、也很值得一讀的、尤其研究民族詩歌的人、關於民族運動的文字有鄭行巽「最近印度民族革命運動」、和柯蓬洲的「安南民族獨立運動的過去與現在」、餘如曼如的「曼克斯蘭民族詩人湯麥斯白朗誕生百年紀念」和倜然的「最近的世界文壇」、内容都充實、</p>
<p>本期尙有一特點、就是圖畫、那幀朱應鵬氏的「后羿射日」實是生色不少、編者爲使我們知道得清楚、在前附誌介紹詞云、</p>
<p>新藝術的創造、思想爲主要點、技術與型式是次要的、因爲技術與型式不過是表現思想的工具而已、中國繪畫的思想、素來沉浸在出世觀念中、與民族毫無關係、這非加改革不可、</p>
<p>中國民族主義的繪畫、是人生的藝術、應該注重人生的表現、不應該再在山水仙佛的窠臼中做工夫了、我們一方面要取中國的民間傳說、故事等等、來做題材、而這種傳說與故事、須含有創造的、向上的、奮鬥的、熱烈的精神的、另一方面要取材於民族運動的歷史和人物、</p>
<p>后羿射日是中國古代傳說的一種、后羿是一個最勇猛的男子、他的妻子——嫦娥——是一個最美麗的女子、這是我們古代男女性模型、顯示出民族性應該勇健而熱烈的、射日的故事、是古代人類心理中征服自然的一種憧憬的象徵、這充分地顯示出前進與奮鬥與精神、</p>
<p>這幀畫眞使我愛得不忍釋手、希望以後時有像這樣的有力的作品發表、也即是努力於民族主義的繪畫呵、</p>

<h3>北遊印象</h3>
<p>— 蘇靈</p>
<p>（十五）蘇娜</p>
<p>蘇娜是我的芳鄰、我因跟她的姊姊麗蔗學俄文而得認識她、雖說認識她、但和她没有連續談過二十句話、這有什麽法子呢、我不會說俄國話和她不會說中國一樣、</p>
<p>她並不什麽美麗、如其她俄國少女一樣、她有很發育的體格、所以能做許多男人們做的事、她有老年的父母、非常和善的俄羅斯人、她有一個很用功念書的妹妹、和兩個姊姊、二姊姊就是敎我俄文的麗蔗、大姊姊是一個女牙醫生、但她有如讀淫婦一樣蕩人的微笑、她最都市代、所以她不常在家、第一次她見着我的時候、她就向我說不完備的英國話、</p>
<p>「你是一個Engiish　man…………」、我報她一輕蔑的微笑、因我並没有英國紳士的服裝、</p>
<p>「No.　But　are　you　a　Gip　y　girl………」</p>
<p>蘇娜、她純然是一個北歐的鄉村的處女、她没有裝飾、淡黃色的短髮垂在盾上、没有脂粉的嫩白的膚色、鹽色的眼睛有着素朴的光輝、而她全體有着彫像般的結實的肉、</p>
<p>她常常我由她的熱情的眼睛看出她是想和我說話、無奈言語的不通限制了、</p>
<p>我每天晚上和宋同去她家裏讀俄文、她看見我們來了、停止一切的工作、也坐到我們一起來、</p>
<p>一次、我回答不出她姊姊問我俄文的練習了、她偷偷地在我耳邊告訴我、</p>
<p>當我第一次知道她的名字的時候、我對她說、</p>
<p>「你的名字正和我的妹妹一樣呢、」也呌蘇娜、你的妹妹、」</p>
<p>「是呢、蘇娜、Shoora、不是差不多嗎、」</p>
<p>於是她高興的笑了、這時我已能勉强說幾句俄語、</p>
<p>一回晚上、她姊姊出外了、她展給我她收藏的畫片看、她能作精緻的圖案、在那畫片夾上我看到、她有三個哥哥、現在只剩一個了、兩個中一個被赤俄打死、而一個却是因爲是赤黨而被白俄殺了、她取出一張三個青年的合影照片給我看、第一次我看到她傷感、</p>
<p>後來、我因或種關係中止了讀俄文、所以我也不到她家裏去了、但她屢屢詢問宋、</p>
<p>「他、蘇靈爲什麽不來呢、」</p>
<p>接着、我領學生旅行到吉林去了三星期、從吉林回來後、天氣已經熱起來了、公園裏的游人也多了起來、</p>
<p>幾次夜裏、我掽見蘇娜挽着一個男子在黑暗的林間慢步、</p>
<h3>復大的壁報</h3>
<p>— 和致</p>
<p>復旦的壁報、最近眞可算是洛陽紙貴、風行全校的了、在每一期壁報發刋的時候、同學們總是擁擠得人山人海、並且還有幾位專探消息的東宫公主們、也很有興味地挨進了人叢中、含羞地望望有没有關於東宫的消息、她們尤其是注意到那阿枋的大著、因爲阿枋是東宫的「私探、」最喜歡寫出一切東宫的秘史、所以、她們一看阿枋又把東宫秘史披露時、一定紅着臉、低着頭、嚕囌了幾聲跑回了東宫去、報告其她怕看壁報的公主們、由此可見她們對阿枋是十二分地重視了、最近公主們對於阿枋有一個可笑的提議、「誰把這猢狲關在籠裏、（猢狲是阿枋自稱）就舉誰爲宫主」（即皇后之美稱）但是終究没有這樣力大的公主能夠擔任了這樣重職、那老猢狲仍就繼續不　地去寫東宫的秘史、這樣我到代幾位公主們着急呢、不錯我看還是寫一張徵文給男同學吧、可以這樣、說「誰把阿枋關在籠裏、推誰爲我們的皇帝、」那嗎、我想一定會有併性窮命的男同學、去把這弱猢狲關上、東宫的秘史從此也可告一段落罷、</p>

<h3>同濟學生組織的活躍</h3>
<p>青年是人生黃金的時代、青春的火熖在青年的生命中燃燒着、沸騰的熱血在青年的周身流動着、整個的生命全是活躍而有生氣、並且青年是不甘於困守在悶鬱的氣氛中、消沉下去、因此青年遂成爲一切組織活動的中心、尤其是到了現在、青年的組織更形活躍、各大學的壁報刋物、日益繁多、琳瑯滿目、幾使我們如入　陰道土、目不暇接了、</p>
<p>然而我們的同濟大學、同學　有幾百人、但同學的組織、却寥若晨星、已成者止有一「新波社、」因此同學之間的感情、爲了缺少聯絡的關係、於是極形散漫與隔閡、校中的空氣、充滿了憂鬱與沉悶、然而熱血的青年、終不能甘於這樣消沉下去、加以終日孜孜於科學的鑽研、生活未免枯燥乏味、於是就有幾位同學發起了一個「青」社、以謀同學間感情的聯絡學術的探討、生活的改造、該社業以籌備就緒、共分五股、出版股（壁報）、事務股、文書股、游藝股、交際股、每股各設股長一人、並定於下星期二（二十二日）開正式成立大會、并舉出籌備委員五人、分向各科徵求社員、而充實牠的力量、聞此次發起及籌備諸人、皆是熱心辦事的同學、故該社的前途、定能爲學校開放一朶光明燦爛的奇葩云、（明）</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Disarmament Preparatory Committee is About to Convene Again</h3>
<p>The surface of world affairs does not match what lies beneath. There is no one who can obtain good results. As is the case with countries today, on the one hand, they strongly advocate disarmament and peace, while on the other hand, they are expanding their armaments and engaging in anti-peace movements. There is nothing more contradictory than this.</p>
<p>However, is the reason for this discrepancy really, as Italian Mussolini said, a manifestation of human hypocrisy, and are all slogans such as disarmament and peace just false pretenses? That is not the case. It is the pressure of the situation and the facts that inevitably lead to this ambiguous phenomenon. The financial difficulties of various countries are uniformly the same, and the struggle between political parties and the instability of the political situation are also common phenomena. In this predicament, not only does no one dare to harbor aggressive ambitions, but they are also afraid that others have aggressive intentions and are eager to eliminate them.</p>
<p>Therefore, those who propose disarmament and advocate peace today must all be doing so with sincerity and genuine intention. However, in reality, since the proposal for disarmament, successive conferences have failed to achieve anything due to environmental constraints. The recent London Conference revealed increasing rifts, and there is no opportunity for cooperation at the League of Nations Conference. The suspicion and apprehension are increasing, and the idea of expanding armaments cannot be avoided. Therefore, the fact that various countries are filled with an anti-peace atmosphere is also a fact and not a false statement.</p>
<p>In this contradictory situation, the fear of war may not ultimately withstand the pressure of reality, and peace will become increasingly dangerous. This is why the Disarmament Preparatory Committee is seeking to proceed again urgently. However, this Disarmament Preparatory Committee, including land and air forces, is of greater importance and has more disputes than the London Conference, which only discussed the navy. If a deep understanding cannot be achieved in fact, the disarmament conference will ultimately become an arms expansion conference. What benefit is there for peace?</p>

<h3>Lu Diping Talks About the Recent Situation of Communist Bandits in Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>Lu Arrived in Nanjing by Plane Yesterday to Mourn Tan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Lu Diping, Commander-in-Chief of the 9th Route Army, arrived in Nanjing yesterday afternoon with his Adjutant General Cao Xinbiao and others by Minsheng Airlines plane from Xun. He immediately went to mourn the late President Tan and participate in the relocation ceremony on the 17th. According to Lu, regarding the communist bandits in Jiangxi Province, the central government has now transferred more than six divisions of troops to return to Jiangxi for encirclement and suppression. Currently, Gong Bingfan is stationed in the Gaoan area, Li Jue's division and Luo Lin's division are defending Pingxiang and Yuanzhou, Deng Ying is stationed in Fuzhou, the 50th Division has completely arrived in Nanchang, the 18th Division has advanced towards the Xintu area, and Xu Kexiang's troops have also sailed from Beijing. With the current strength of the troops, the communist bandits have been surrounded by our army. According to investigation reports, Zhu and Mao's main force is currently based in Ji'an, and Peng Dehuai is based in Xinyu. Since hearing of the transfer of a large army to Jiangxi, they have automatically withdrawn the bandit army from counties such as Xintu and Qingjiang. Currently, there are no bandit troops on the east bank of the Gan River. They are probably planning to retreat to the Fujian border, and our army is strictly encircling and suppressing them, so as to prevent them from escaping to the Fujian border and causing future trouble.

<h3>Re-election of Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the German Reichstag</h3>
<p>Social Democratic Leader Still Elected</p>
<p>Order in the Chamber Maintained Throughout</p>
<p>Misunderstanding Arises from Broadcast Tragedy</p>
<p>Metalworkers' Strike Does Not Affect Political Situation</p>
<p>Surge in Export Trade Boosts Stock Market</p>
<p>Party Member Assaulted for Criticizing the Party</p>
<p>A Strange Tale Amidst Political Tension</p>
<p>▲ Berlin, 15th (National News Agency) - Today, the Reichstag elected its speaker, and Social Democratic leader, Löbe, was once again elected. Since Germany adopted the republican system, Löbe has been the speaker for almost every term. His election this time was largely due to the support of the Center Party. The right-wing parties, from the German National People's Party to the National Socialist Party, jointly nominated German National People's Party leader Dr. Schultze as their candidate. The far-left Communist Party also nominated its own candidate. As a result, no one received the required number of votes in the first round. In the second decisive vote, Löbe received 269 votes and was elected, while Schultze received 209 votes. The Communist Party members abstained from voting. When the results were announced, the government party members cheered and congratulated each other. When the defeated Schultze sincerely congratulated Löbe, the cheers grew even louder, as this gesture was seen as the government's first victory in the Reichstag. Subsequently, the Deputy Speakers were elected: Stöhr of the National Socialist Party, Esse of the Center Party, and Grae of the German National People's Party. Today, National Socialist Party members all attended the Reichstag in civilian attire, and order was maintained throughout the chamber.</p>
<p>▲ Berlin, 15th (National News Agency) - The fear that the metalworkers' strike would have a negative impact on the political situation has fortunately not materialized so far. Although 276 factories and workshops have been shut down, no serious incidents have occurred. Well-known electrical material factories have been affected, but only half of the workers at the Siemens factory have disobeyed the strike order and are continuing to work as usual. The authorities have deployed special police near the factory for protection. The Minister of Labor is making every effort to mediate to prevent the strike from dragging on and affecting other industries. A special feature of this labor unrest is that the "cudgel" National Socialist Party has also declared its complete sympathy for the workers and promised to provide them with substantial assistance.</p>
<p>▲ Berlin Correspondence, September 28th (Pacific News Agency) - Yesterday afternoon, during a radio broadcast program by the broadcasting company, a tragedy was aired, titled "The Minister is Assassinated," which was written about former Foreign Minister Hartung. The audience's misunderstanding at the time was quite peculiar, reflecting the extreme political emotions and the tense political situation. According to the play's script, the Foreign Minister returned from Geneva and was unfortunately assassinated at the station at 8:30 PM. When people in Germany and abroad heard this, most Germans mistook it for a breaking news announcement and rushed into the streets, spreading all kinds of alarming rumors. Anti-fascist demonstrations also broke out in various working-class areas. As a result, the National Socialist Party suffered a great deal of abuse and was in a very embarrassing situation, which did not subside until midnight. At the same time, foreign reporters stationed in Berlin received telegrams from their respective newspapers, inquiring about the details of the assassination. Even the German government received numerous telegrams, expressing condolences or offering to help maintain order, which was quite bizarre.</p>

<h3>British Conservative Party Announces Seven Policies</h3>
<p>MacDonald Calls Them...</p>
<p>A Grotesque Mixture</p>
<p>▲ London, 15th (Reuters) - Conservative Party leader Baldwin wrote a letter to the chairman of the party organization, outlining the policies the Conservative Party will pursue when it regains power. His statement was quite lengthy, with the main points being: (1) Striving for thrift; (2) Reducing taxes; (3) Thoroughly reforming the unemployment insurance system; (4) Immediately adopting emergency tariffs to effectively protect British manufacturing and counter foreign competition; (5) Guaranteeing the price of British-grown wheat and preventing the cheap dumping of foreign agricultural products; (6) Developing a sound plan to secure an effective market for wheat produced in the country and the empire; (7) Harmonizing actions with overseas dominions to promote economic unity within the empire. Baldwin also stated that the Conservative Party agrees in principle with Canadian Prime Minister Bennett's proposal for a ten-percent preferential tariff within the empire.</p>
<p>▲ London, 16th (Reuters) - British Prime Minister MacDonald criticized the policies announced by Baldwin, saying that everyone benefits from them except the working class. He called these policies a grotesque mixture, adding that Baldwin now wants to mix all the contentious issues he previously fought against into his party. He said it would be very appropriate to send him the message, "I'm waving the flag!" The Daily Express stated that Baldwin's remarks represent the Conservative Party's plan to levy taxes on everything.</p>
<h3>Continuous Decline of Spanish Currency Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>More Worrying Than Labor Unrest</p>
<p>▲ Madrid, 15th (National News Agency) - Spanish Prime Minister General Primo de Rivera issued a statement saying that the government's troops are fully capable of dealing with labor unrest. However, the continued decline of the Spanish currency exchange rate is the most worrying issue at present. He said that this decline does not correspond to the actual situation in the country, and the government will soon formulate strict measures to curb it. The members of the government's special financial committee have gone abroad to consult with international banks and major European banks in order to stabilize the price of the Spanish currency.</p>
<h3>Japan's Air Force Expansion Plan</h3>
<p>▲ Tokyo, 16th (Denstu News Agency) - The content of the Navy's proposed supplemental plan for expanding the air force is to increase the number of land-based air squadrons by seventeen, bringing the total to thirty-two. The number of aircraft will be increased by 256 for land-based use and 300 for ship-based use. This plan is based on the assumption that the US air force will have 1,200 aircraft capable of crossing the Pacific Ocean by 1936, and the goal is to provide a minimum level of defense equivalent to one-third of that force. The Navy is concerned that it will be difficult to achieve even this number due to the current scarcity of funds.</p>
<h3>Total Amount of Japanese National Debt</h3>

<p>▲ London, 15th (Reuters) - The Indian government's six-percent public debt of 12 million pounds, redeemable from 1935 to 1937, closed for subscription at 10:00 AM this morning.</p>
<p>▲ Bombay, 16th (Reuters) - Another 250 people were arrested today. The total number of people arrested since yesterday morning has reached 430.

After the Indian National Congress's offices were searched yesterday, the Congress headquarters have now been moved back to the Muslim quarter.</p>
<h3>Japan's Representatives to the League of Nations Disarmament Preparatory Committee Decided</h3>
<p>▲ Tokyo, 16th (Japan United Press) - The League of Nations Disarmament Preparatory Committee, scheduled to open in Geneva on November 6th, will be attended not only by League members but also by non-League members such as the United States, Russia, Turkey, and Brazil. Japan's plenipotentiary representative and staff have been decided as follows: "Plenipotentiary Representative": Naotake Satō, Director of the League of Nations Japanese Affairs Bureau; "Staff": Nobushi Itō, Embassy Counselor; Mizuno Itamoto, Secretary; "Army Representative": Major General Toshio Tani; Major Katsumi Ōta, Artillery; "Navy Representative": Colonel Ichirō Satō; Lieutenant Commander Sadatoshi Tomioka; Lieutenant Tatsuyoshi Miyoshi.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union's Efforts to Promote Industrialization</h3>
<p>Unemployment Benefits Canceled</p>
<p>▲ Moscow, 15th (National News Agency) - The Russian government's official newspaper reported that although the Five-Year Industrial Plan is being actively implemented, it has encountered many difficulties and has not yet been implemented according to the original plan. During this period, special efforts will be made to accelerate progress, with the goal of increasing production by 46% compared to the previous period, with a value of 55 billion rubles. However, the new capital needed for state-owned industries will also reach 10 billion rubles. The result of this rapid progress will not only make up for previous delays but also prevent future delays. The Soviet Union's fiscal year begins on October 1st each year.</p>
<p>▲ Riga, 15th (Pacific News Agency) - The Soviet government has decided to cancel unemployment benefits. Workers who want to stop working must have a doctor's certificate confirming their illness. Regardless of the type of work, workers who become unemployed can be forced to work in other jobs.</p>
<h3>Canadian Prime Minister's Proposal</h3>
<p>Preferential Trade within the Domestic Market</p>
<p>▲ London, 15th (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Bennett issued a radio message today, announcing his proposal to exchange ten-percent preferential tariffs with Britain and other imperial markets. He stated that this proposal must be either accepted or rejected, and there is no other option. However, this decision is extremely important, so his responsibility is to say that if this opportunity to strengthen imperial economic relations is missed now, it will never come again. This is not a scare tactic, but a prediction based on fundamental changes in the world trade situation. These fundamental changes are the industrialization and intense competition that are already taking place.</p>

<h3>Central Propaganda Department's Talk</h3>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department held a talk with newspaper reporters at 2:00 PM on the 16th in the Central Second Conference Hall. More than 20 reporters from various newspapers attended. Secretary Zhu Yunguang presided over the meeting and reported on observations of the recent defeat of the Northern warlords. He briefly stated that he arrived in Tianjin on March 9th, at the time when Yan Xishan had telegraphed his resignation. The general opinion in the North was that the people of Shanxi hated Yan to the bone and hoped he would leave quickly. Later, after meeting with responsible figures in politics and the military, it was also said that Yan had been preparing in Shanxi for 20 years, with meticulous planning and stockpiling of grain and weapons, and it was feared that he might not actually fulfill his so-called resignation. From April onwards, they gathered fugitives and clearly rebelled, calling on the masses to "protect the party and save the country." Thus, they cobbled together the Western Hills Conference faction, the Reorganization faction, and the remnants of Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan into one group. However, the Western Hills and Reorganization factions were fundamentally incompatible, each aiming for Tianjin and Beijing. Later, the Western Hills faction relied on Yan, and the Reorganization faction relied on Feng, so Yan and Feng also clearly split. The so-called Expanded Conference members also knew that it could not succeed and would at most muddle through for a few months as a mere embellishment. At a time when Yan's desire for leadership was burgeoning, he knew that the Expanded Conference could not succeed, but he still used it to boost his own ego. When Yan and Feng first planned their rebellion, they agreed that Feng would be responsible for military affairs and Yan would be responsible for political affairs. When Yan's army made some progress on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, Yan considered Feng useless. When the Central Army recovered Jinan, the Shanxi army fled in a panic, with many falling into the Yellow River from their vehicles. At the same time, Yan prepared to abandon Tianjin and Beijing. At that time, Feng advocated that the Tianjin-Pukou Shanxi army be reorganized and transferred to the Longhai Railway, but Yan did not agree. In reality, even if the Tianjin-Pukou Shanxi army were reorganized, it would amount to no more than 30,000 men. When Feng's army was in dire straits on the Longhai Railway, Feng repeatedly telegraphed Yan, urging him to send reinforcements, but the Shanxi army never agreed. Later, because of the problem with Ma Tingfu at Shanhaiguan, they sent Jia Jingde and Xue Dubi to Beidaihe to meet with Zhang Xueliang. Only after Zhang issued his clever telegram did they realize that Zhang had always supported the Central Government and did not approve of Yan and Feng's attitude. The actions of the so-called party, government, and military figures in the North were so childish that one can imagine how ridiculous they were, and it can be absolutely concluded that they were doomed to fail. As for the newspapers in the North during Yan and Feng's reactionary period, apart from the newspapers run by Yan and Feng, the remaining newspapers were able to uphold justice under pressure, for which we are deeply grateful. The meeting adjourned after the report was completed.</p>

<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the Jin army withdrew from Shandong, the defense of northern Shandong has been the responsibility of Zhao Xinde's Brigade under Sun Tongxuan's Twelfth Army. However, when the Jin army was about to withdraw, there were still scattered troops that had not withdrawn due to the haste of the time. Han Fuju, the Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Corps, believed that these routed soldiers should be accepted and comforted, so he specially appointed Mei Jun as the Commander of the Provisional First Army of the First Army Corps to carry out the acceptance and comforting, with the aim of forming a strong army. Yesterday, on the 7th, Mei had already issued a notice of his assumption of office from Dezhou. At the same time, he was sworn into office at the Dezhou military station. According to Mei's talk about the current situation of the army and its future mission, he briefly stated that he had received the appointment from Commander Han on September 4th, but for the sake of prudence, he did not announce it at that time. He is currently only reorganizing three brigades, and the rest are still being negotiated. The purpose is to purely accept the disbanded troops from the Jin side. Bandits will be suppressed and not incorporated. Zhang Haiquan and other troops in Ling County, except for Zhang Haoran's troops, the remaining Zhang Haiquan and Yan's troops are not in harmony with the local area, and Zhao's Brigade of the Twelfth Army has already gone to suppress them severely, which is also not a problem. In addition, there are quite a few people who voluntarily join from the local people in various counties. The ones that have recently been formed are Zhang Haoran, Li Shirong, and Zhou Tong, totaling three brigades. The number of people in each brigade may not be accurate in their reports, so in addition to sending appropriate personnel to thoroughly investigate, he must personally verify them. All those with complex backgrounds or addicted to drugs will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Regarding bandit suppression and village cleansing matters, it is said that the most important tasks are the reorganization of the militia and the suppression of bandits and village cleansing. Reorganizing the militia and suppressing bandits is the first step, and village cleansing is the second step. Since bandit suppression must be carried out jointly by the army and the militia in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort, they are given equal importance. After the commanders of the militia in each district are announced, the first step is to convene a militia conference. The militia conference in eastern Shandong has now concluded, and the militia are about to be dispatched to assist the army in suppressing bandits. The coordination of the militia in southern Shandong has also been completed. The militia in western Shandong are also being coordinated. Zhao Renquan, the commander of the militia in northern Shandong, is scheduled to convene a militia conference within the next few days. As for the stationed troops in various places, they have already been dispatched separately to suppress bandits on a large scale in order to eliminate the problem once and for all. In addition to those originally in various places, the entire Eighty-seventh Brigade of Rong Guangxing was sent to Dongchang and Guantao to assist Ma Jingong's Brigade in surrounding and suppressing the bandit gang Wang Jinfang, starting from the 11th. It is expected that the banditry in Shandong can be completely eliminated in two months. (12th)</p>
<h3>Resumption of Direct Jinpu Railway Service Imminent</h3>
<p>▲ Direct Service Method Agreed Upon</p>
<p>▲ Current Status of Northern Section Revenue</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Due to the failure to unify the railway rights of the Tianjin and Pukou Railway Administrations, direct train service between Tianjin and Pukou has not yet been established. Both passenger and freight transport are inconvenienced. She Xu, Chief of the Transportation Department of the Pukou Railway Administration, recently went to Tianjin to discuss the resumption of train service. Wang Ruiting, Chief of the Transportation Department of the Tianjin Railway Administration, also arrived in Jinan on the 9th to discuss all matters. According to Wang, the purpose of his visit is twofold: first, to inspect the conditions along the route; and second, to connect with railway personnel here, so that direct train service between Tianjin and Pukou can be restored as soon as possible, thereby maintaining railway administration. Although there are currently two railway administrations on the Jinpu Railway, we absolutely do not divide boundaries in order to promote railway development. Concrete measures for resuming the first and second direct trains between Tianjin and Pukou have already been discussed with Chief She in Tianjin. The Tianjin Railway Administration can provide one passenger train, and the Pukou Railway Administration can provide three passenger trains, totaling four trains. If there is no shortage of locomotives, the first and second trains between Tianjin and Pukou can run daily. This matter will be finalized with Chief She after I return to Tianjin tomorrow (the 13th), and direct train service between Tianjin and Pukou can be restored. Currently, the Tianjin Railway Administration has five usable locomotives, one under repair, and one shunting locomotive, as well as more than forty passenger and freight cars. The Tianjin Railway Administration manages up to Sangyuan, while the Pukou Railway Administration manages up to Dezhou. Revenue from both administrations is temporarily divided at Sangyuan. Because the locomotives in the northern section are too large, they cannot cross the Yellow River Bridge, so locomotives are exchanged in Dezhou. There are currently two passenger-freight mixed trains daily between Tianjin and Dezhou, the 13th and 14th. Between Jinan and Tianjin, there are two passenger-freight mixed trains daily, the 9th and 10th. The daily revenue of the Tianjin Railway Administration is approximately six to seven thousand yuan, while monthly employee salaries require approximately 140,000 yuan, and materials and coal require approximately 20,000 yuan, totaling less than 170,000 yuan. However, the monthly revenue is at least 190,000 yuan, which is sufficient to cover expenses with a surplus. If direct train service between Tianjin and Pukou is restored, revenue will inevitably increase sharply, and the future of this railway is promising. This year, due to the Jinpu Railway being closed, the fare for ships between Qingdao and Shanghai has increased from eight yuan to fifteen yuan per person, all on Japanese ships. Such losses are truly regrettable. (12th)</p>
<h3>Inauguration of Direct Train Service to Pingji</h3>
<p>▲ Opening Ceremony Held on Double Tenth Festival</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The North-Ning Railway's third and fourth express trains have been changed to direct trains to Pingji, departing from Ping for the first time on the morning of the Double Tenth Festival. At 6:50 AM on the 11th, they entered the Shenhai Railway, passing through the Jihai Railway and heading directly to Jilin. According to the original schedule, they will arrive at 8:45 PM on the 11th. They will return on the morning of the 12th at 7:00 AM, arriving back in Beiping at 7:15 PM on the 13th. The round trip takes 82 hours and 50 minutes, and excluding the 10 hours of stopover in Jilin, it only takes 72 hours. Communication between Ping and Ji is more convenient than before, marking a new era in the joint operation of railways in the Northeast. To commemorate the occasion, the North-Ning Railway Administration held an opening ceremony at the East Station on the 10th. In addition to erecting a decorated archway in front of the station, with the words "Universal Rail Gauge" formed by electric lights in the center, the words "Commemoration of Direct Train Service to Pingji" were inlaid in gold below. Opposite the ticket office, there was a notice stating, "The 3rd train on October 10th goes directly to Jilin, hereby announced." The price list was also clearly listed in chalk on the notice board. The train is still the same vehicle used for the North-Ning Railway's 3rd train, with only the original sign "From Beiping to Shenyang" on the outside of the car door replaced with "From Beiping to Jilin." There are no other changes. However, the "191" locomotive pulling the train was decorated with Songhua knots all around, and a shield-shaped pattern was painted on the front, with the words "Congratulations" written in the center. The entire train consists of one postal guard car and mixed car, three postal first-class sleeping cars, one first-second class mixed car, two second-class cars, and four third-class cars. After arriving in Shenyang, the postal car will be removed, and two first-second class cars will also be unloaded. The remaining seven cars will continue to Jilin. It is said that this is due to the fact that the rails on the Shenji Railway cannot bear heavy loads. According to the Deputy Stationmaster of Qianmen, before the Pingji line was opened, it was necessary to travel through the South Manchuria Railway to get from Beiping to Jilin. Now that direct train service is available, it is no longer necessary to transfer on Japanese railways. From now on, travel from Ping to Ji will be entirely on our national railways and railways operated by Chinese merchants. After departing from Ping, the train will pass through Fengtai, Tianjin, Tanggu, Tangshan, Changli, Qinhuangdao, Shanhaiguan, Lianshan, Jin County, Goubangzi, Dahushan, Xinmin County, and arrive in Shenyang. It will then transfer to the Shenhai Railway, pass through stations such as Shanchengzhen and arrive at Hailong. It will then transfer to the Jihai Railway, pass through Chaoyangzhen, Panshi, and Yantongshan, and arrive in Jilin. It only takes thirty-six hours to arrive. First-class tickets cost 59 yuan, second-class tickets cost 38 yuan and 85 cents, and third-class tickets cost 20 yuan and 4 cents and 5 cents. This is also a sign of the progress of transportation in our country, and passengers are all pleased. (October 12th)</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Duan Heng Case of Unauthorized Killing of a County Magistrate</h3>
<p>▲ He Jian Deeply Appreciates Duan's Meritorious Service</p>
<p>▲ Permission Granted for the Official to Atone for His Crime Through Future Service</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Duan Heng, Commander of the Hunan Southern Garrison and Brigade Commander of the 55th Brigade of the 19th Division, killed Luo Cheng, the Magistrate of Leiyang County, without authorization on September 28th. Subsequently, Cao Bowen, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, presented to the Provincial Government, through the Fourth Route Headquarters, that Duan's actions disrupted the Hunan administrative system and requested strict punishment. At the same time, public opinion in Changsha believed that such military autocracy not only made county magistrates feel insecure but also completely undermined the administrative system and advocated strict punishment. In addition, Luo Cheng's family argued that Luo was shot and killed by Duan inside the county government office, which showed that he did not abandon his post, and demanded that the government vindicate him. He Jian believed that, according to the law, a severe punishment should be imposed to uphold justice. However, when Duan Yong, Tang Shengming, and others fought bravely and repelled the joint attack on Hengzhou by the communist bandits Zhu Mao and others, he made great contributions. Furthermore, the local security of more than twenty counties in southern Hunan in the future still relies on Duan's troops to maintain it. Punishing him according to the law would likely harm the overall situation in southern Hunan, while not punishing him according to the law would not appease public anger in Hunan. Therefore, in the absence of a feasible solution, Duan Heng was dismissed from his post but allowed to temporarily retain all his concurrent positions and atone for his crime through future service. This case was thus resolved. He Jian has already reported this to the National Government and replied to the Hunan Provincial Government.</p>
<p>▲ Document Presented to the National Government: Regarding the case of Duan Heng, Commander of the Hunan Southern Garrison under our command, executing Luo Cheng, the Magistrate of Leiyang County, we respectfully request your review and instructions. According to the telegram received on the 29th of last month from Duan Heng, Commander of the Hunan Southern Garrison, (omitted)... Therefore, we have investigated that the communist bandits were rampant and previously attacked Changsha again. After being fiercely attacked by our forces, they failed to succeed and dispersed into smaller groups, scattering into the border areas of various counties, causing intolerable disturbances. We ordered our troops to pursue them and strictly ordered all counties to rectify their local defense forces and block key points. However, the Magistrate of Leiyang County, Luo Cheng, did not wait for the bandits to arrive, even though the bandits were entrenched in Anren, which was far away, and abandoned his post without authorization, causing the people to flee and the order to be disrupted. According to the law, this dereliction of duty and disruption of the rear should be severely punished. However, he is an administrative official and has his own competent authority. The commander did not submit a request to our department for review before the event and dared to execute him without authorization, which is inappropriate and should be severely punished to warn those who act recklessly. Considering that when the communist bandits Zhu Mao, Peng Huang, and others joined forces to attack the province, and the rebel Tang Yan and others took the opportunity to invade Qihang, the situation was extremely critical. The commander led his new troops and the local defense forces under his command, drove the rebels Tang Yan and others out of Hunan, and blocked the communist bandits who were causing disturbances in Cha'an, allowing the people of more than twenty counties in southern Hunan to live in peace. His meritorious service is significant. Therefore, we leniently granted him dismissal but allowed him to temporarily retain all his concurrent positions to show punishment. We will continue to observe him at any time. If the official renders any further meritorious service, we will request the withdrawal of the punishment. Whether this is appropriate, we hereby submit this document to your government for review and instructions. This is in the public interest. Respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>▲ Reply Letter to the Hunan Provincial Government: Sir, we have received your government's letter regarding the case of Duan Heng, Commander of the Hunan Southern Garrison, executing Luo Cheng, the Magistrate of Leiyang County. Apart from the full text of the case on file, which should be omitted, please review and discuss the matter, and order all subordinates to ensure that such incidents do not occur again with regard to administrative officials in this province in the future, in order to clarify the system, etc. Upon examination, this case was previously reported to the department by the commander in a telegram, and we were preparing to impose a severe punishment. However, considering that the commander executed an administrative official without authorization, which is a violation of the law, and that when the communist bandits attacked Changsha, Tang Shengming took the opportunity to attempt to seize Hengyong, the commander bravely defeated them and sent troops to block the communist bandits, protecting southern Hunan, his meritorious service is significant. Therefore, we leniently granted him dismissal but temporarily allowed him to retain all his concurrent positions, ordering him to atone for his crime through future service to show punishment. In addition to ordering the commander to comply and reporting to the Central National Government, and issuing orders to various troops, we hereby reply to your government for review.

<h3>Grand Celebration of the Double Tenth Festival in Beiping</h3>
<p>▲ Diplomatic Building Hosts Foreign Guests</p>
<p>Beiping News: The 10th was the National Day commemoration day, and all agencies, organizations, and schools in Beiping took a day off. Merchants also hung flags to celebrate. The Municipal Government and the Public Security Bureau held celebrations separately in the morning. Acting Mayor Wang Tao also hosted foreign guests at the Diplomatic Building. On this day, most tourist attractions offered discounted admission. Especially the Palace Museum and the Ancient Artifacts Exhibition Hall were crowded with tourists. In addition, entertainment venues were also very crowded. In the evening, the colored arches in front of the east and west train stations, in front of various agency gates, and on major thoroughfares were brightly lit, almost like a sleepless city. The desolate capital suddenly became lively. The situation in various aspects is recorded below:</p>
<p>Acting Mayor Wang Tao, First Army Commander Yu Xuezhong, Director of the Diplomatic Archives Preservation Office Qi Dapeng, and Public Security Bureau Chief Bao Yulin hosted foreign guests at the Diplomatic Building at 11:00 AM on the Double Tenth Festival. Attendees included American Minister Johnson, British Minister Lampson, German Minister Borche, Danish Minister Kauffmann, Dutch Minister Oudendijk, French Minister Wilden, Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Yano Makoto, and ministers from Sweden, Spain, Portugal, and Brazil, as well as the Italian-Belgian Chargé d'Affaires. Chinese attendees included Hu Weide, Dai Chenlin, Chen Lu, Tang Zaifu, Xia Yiting, and several others.

Mayor Wang Tao presided over the meeting and first stood up to give a speech, saying, "Today is the 19th National Day commemoration of our country, and we are deeply honored to have the ministers and representatives of various countries present. We wish your countries prosperity and wish you all good health." Then he raised his glass for a toast. Subsequently, Minister Oudendijk, the leader of the diplomatic corps, delivered a reply, saying, "Today we have the honor to celebrate your country's National Day and are honored to be invited to celebrate. We wish your country lasting peace and prosperity and wish your Mayor and gentlemen good health." Finally, everyone took a photo together in the West Building dormitory as a memento. The guests and hosts parted in joy at twelve o'clock.</p>
<p>The Beiping Municipal Government held a celebration ceremony at the Zhongshan Memorial Hall at 9:00 AM on the Double Tenth Festival. Attendees included Acting Mayor Wang Tao, Secretary-General Wu Chengqi, various section chiefs and staff members, and employees of the Finance Bureau, totaling more than two hundred people. Wang Tao presided over the meeting, and Secretary Deng Yao reported on the Wuchang Uprising. Finally, the chairman gave a speech, saying, "Today is the National Day commemoration of the 19th year of the Republic of China, and I am very happy to gather here with you to celebrate. Recalling the past nineteen years, wars have occurred from time to time, the people have been displaced, and have suffered deeply. The municipal policy has not fully implemented the teachings of the Premier. Therefore, on this grand ceremony today, thinking about the past, I am filled with shame. However, the current military situation is quite good. The Central Army has reached Zhengzhou, and the Northeast Army is deployed throughout Hebei. It is expected to end soon. By then, the whole country will be unified, and we should continue to work hard and earnestly to alleviate the suffering of the people. Then, on this day next year, there will definitely be achievements to show. Although I dare not say that we will have a peaceful and prosperous life, at least we must make the people live in peace. From then on, step by step construction will reduce poverty day by day, and the prosperity of the city can be expected. This will not only benefit the country, but also bring honor to us." The meeting adjourned at ten o'clock. The Public Security Bureau held a National Day ceremony in the auditorium of the bureau at 8:00 AM on the 10th, convening the chiefs of various district offices and all employees of the bureau. The director, Bao Yulin, presided over the meeting and explained the significance of the National Day commemoration, and encouraged all subordinates to work hard in their duties. It adjourned at nine o'clock and continued to convene the staff of the various public schools and students over the age of ten in the gymnasium for the National Day commemorative meeting. About thirty schools, totaling about two thousand people, attended. The meeting began at 10:15 AM. Bao Yulin temporarily could not attend because of attending the foreign guest reception at the Diplomatic Building. He sent Section Chief Wu to represent him. Li Jingtian, the principal of each public school, presided over the meeting. Li gave a speech, saying that the Republic of China was born from today nineteen years ago. To date, politics has not been put on the right track. We will not talk about the major policies of the party and government. Education in the war zone has not been going smoothly, and it is difficult to proceed smoothly in non-war zones. I hope that in the future the country will devote all its efforts to education, especially public education. No matter what country in the world, they all take education as their foundation. I hope that all students will not take themselves too lightly. Who knows that the future rulers are not the students of today's public schools. And I hope that all teachers will not teach in reverse, do not exceed the times, and instill in the students the knowledge to adapt to the environment and time. Then they can progress day by day. Then Section Chief Wu gave a speech on behalf of the director. Then each teacher gave a speech. The meeting adjourned at eleven o'clock.</p>

However, County Magistrate Li and others telegraphed to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to request his retention, and asked Chief Judge Lin to withdraw the order. The order has already been issued, allowing Yang to remain in his post. The position of Assessment Officer in Jingjiang County will be filled by Liang Wei (from Jiangdu), currently serving as Assessment Officer of Yu County. Liang has already arrived in Jingjiang to take office.</p>

<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Gaoxing's Granddaughter in Lijia Lane Kidnapped: In Lijia Lane, Changxing County, a farmer named Gao Guaijiao supports himself by farming. Last month, he received a letter from bandits demanding a large ransom. Because Gao had no spare money, he did not contact the bandits. The bandits, believing that Gao was deliberately ignoring them, held a grudge. On the night of the 11th, more than a dozen bandits suddenly came, speaking with a Hakka accent and each holding a wooden-cased gun. They broke into his house, looted all his clothes and belongings, and kidnapped Gao's granddaughter before leaving. They left a letter demanding that he contact them at a certain place within five days, or they would tear up the ransom note and burn down the house.</p>
<p>All Circles in Nanxun Reject Mao Ying's Appointment: All village and neighborhood committees and public organization representatives in Nanxun Town, Huzhou, are concerned about the provincial government's rumored appointment of Mao Ying as the chief of the town's Public Security Sub-bureau. On the morning of the 12th of this month, they held a meeting to discuss the matter. They unanimously agreed that Mao Ying had served as the head of the town's police substation ten years ago, engaging in gambling and opium dens without restraint. His past misdeeds are well known to the elders. If he comes again this time, he will inevitably repeat his past mistakes. They decided to send telegrams to the provincial government, strongly rejecting his appointment.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Shanyang Passenger Boat Robbed by Bandits: A passenger boat traveling from this county to Shanyang set sail from Shanyang on the 15th. At around 11:00 AM, while passing the ice factory west of Jinsiniang Bridge (the border between Jiangsu and Zhejiang), over thirty bandits suddenly appeared, armed with rifles. They first fired shots as a warning, then tied up the boat owner, Yougen, and conducted a thorough search, looting silver dollars, banknotes, and various valuables. The total loss is estimated to be over 4,000 yuan, with over 3,000 yuan belonging to a cotton firm and intended for remittances to Pinghu. After the robbery, the bandits marched in formation towards the southeast.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Young Girl Raped by Bandits: Yesterday, detectives from the Provincial Public Security Bureau saw a strong man walking with a young girl in the Daxuechang area. Suspecting their behavior, they questioned them. The man's answers were evasive, indicating that he was not a good person. They took them to the Public Security Bureau for preliminary interrogation. The details were quite complicated, so they were sent to the court for pretrial. The girl claimed that her name was Du Xiaoyatou, and she was 15 years old. She was from Tongcheng, Bao'ying. On the 13th day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar, hundreds of bandits came to Tongcheng to rob and kidnapped many women, including her. She suffered rape by the bandits. Eventually, Gao Xueyuan took her to his home in Xihu. Gao's mother told her to marry his son as his wife. Later, because the merchant corps suppressed bandits, Gao took her to Zhenjiang and lived at Wang Ziyun's house. Gao Xueyuan claimed that he was 23 years old and from Xuyi. On the 6th day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar, four to five hundred bandits asked him to flee with them. Considering that his maternal uncle was killed by bandits for not fleeing, he had no choice but to comply. He took her to Tongcheng, Bao'ying. The bandits instructed him to look after her as she was kidnapped, that is Du Xiaoyatou. They abandoned her because Du's family could not pay the ransom. He took her back, and his mother told him to keep her as his wife. Because the merchant corps caught bandits, he arrived in Zhenjiang. He was going to Changzhou to find work, and Wang Ziyun asked him to take Du with him. He was unable to support her, so he wrote a divorce letter to Wang. After obtaining the confession, the Public Security Bureau recorded the entire situation and transferred Gao Xueyuan, Du Xiaoyatou, and others to the court for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Detailed Account of the Bandit Looting of Shagou Town: Shagou Town in Yancheng County is connected to Linze Town in Gaoyou. It has over a thousand households and a very developed commerce, making it a well-known major town in Jiangbei. It was previously burned and looted by bandits, causing a loss of over 200,000 yuan. In less than two months, local people, believing that the stationed troops were not strong enough, voluntarily organized a militia and purchased a large number of firearms. They strictly questioned anyone with suspicious behavior. Therefore, for a month, it was quite peaceful. This time, the town was looted by bandits because Ma Yuren harassed Yancheng and other counties. Li Mingyang, the bandit suppression commander of Jiangsu Province, led the 3rd Regiment Commander of the Security Department, Li Changjiang, and the 133rd Brigade Commander, Liu Hansheng, to suppress him fiercely and destroyed Ma Yuren's lair, Shajiazhuang. Ma led his subordinates to occupy the Ludang marshes. Another group of over 2,000 bandits fled towards Shagou. The bandits arrived at Sha at 4:00 AM on the 8th. A small number of bandits took four or five boats to the tax bureau, attempting to enter the town through the wooden gate. The stationed soldiers there, seeing their suspicious behavior, refused to let them pass. The bandits used axes to destroy the wooden gate. The soldiers opened fire, killing several bandits. Then, they exchanged fire. Stationed soldiers and militia in the town heard the alarm and came to rescue. However, 2,000 bandits surrounded them. After two hours of fierce fighting, both sides suffered twenty to thirty casualties. The stationed soldiers and militia were outnumbered and retreated outside the town. The bandits entered the town and went to the home of the elder Zhao Yusheng, kidnapping the entire Zhao family. Then, they set fire and looted everywhere, burning down over a hundred houses, shooting over twenty townspeople, and kidnapping 136 men and women. The next morning, they left Sha and occupied Wangjiazhuang nearby. Li Mingyang has sent the 3rd Regiment Commander, Li Changjiang, from Yancheng, along with the military police of Yancheng, Xinghua, Gaoyou, and Baoying counties, to encircle and suppress them. It is reported that the bandits have fled northeast.</p>

<p>Navy to Send Warships to Protect the Sea: Fishermen and merchants in coastal counties of Zhejiang have suffered greatly due to rampant piracy, with fishing boats being repeatedly plundered when venturing out to sea. Therefore, Dinghai, Xiangshan, Lingwen, and other counties sent representatives to Beijing to petition the central government. The representatives have returned to their respective counties. As a result of the petition, Chen Shaokuan, Vice Minister of the Navy, agreed to send three warships to protect the Zhejiang waters. The Ministry of Interior also plans to take appropriate measures.</p>
<p>Kidnappings Frequent in Fenghua: Since the jailbreak incident in Fenghua, kidnappings have been frequent. It is now known that over twenty bandits suddenly appeared in Shimen Village in the western district of the county yesterday, kidnapping Mao Helin, Mao Xiangchao, and Mao Niangzi, residents of the village. They also shot and killed Mao Meide's wife. Panic spread, and people are filled with fear.</p>
<p>Special Item</p>
<h3>Reflections on the National Day Commemoration of the Nineteenth Year (Chen Mingshu)</h3>
<p>The Republic of China, founded by the late Premier, has now reached its nineteenth year. How much effort did the Premier and the martyrs expend, how long did it take, to liberate our Chinese nation from the autocratic Qing Dynasty and establish a republic unifying five ethnicities? Afterwards, under the leadership of the Premier and the striving of the people, and through immense sacrifice, we were able to maintain the nation's destiny and its form until today. As we solemnly and splendidly commemorate this occasion, we must first deeply understand and admire the great achievements of the late Premier and the martyrs with the utmost sincerity and respect. At the same time, regarding our magnificent and renewed Republic of China, and Guangdong, the birthplace of the revolution, how should we express our joy and love?</p>
<p>The Chinese people often have two opposing mentalities: some are saddened by the past but optimistic about the present, while others are pessimistic about the present but yearn for the past. Considering the frequent political changes, continuous warfare, economic hardship, and national decline of the past nineteen years, those who hold the second mentality may even say that the new nation is inferior to the preceding dynasty, and that revolution is inferior to conservatism. This is a superficial argument that fails to grasp the historical evolution and national situation. It must be understood that our Chinese nation, after thousands of years of autocracy and isolation, suddenly opened its doors and overthrew the imperial system. This was the most drastic change in our national history, as well as the most difficult. In this extremely drastic and difficult change, it is inevitable that we must endure considerable suffering in order to obtain greater happiness. The substitution of this suffering for happiness depends on how hard we Chinese people work.</p>
<p>Taking the past nineteen years as an example, it was because the Chinese people failed to fully fulfill their responsibilities as citizens that Yuan Shikai dared to declare himself emperor. It was because the Chinese people failed to fully fulfill their responsibilities as citizens that warlords were able to exercise autocratic rule. Although there was the opportunity of the European war in the middle period, industry and commerce could not progress alongside Japan. Moreover, agriculture tended towards a state of decline. Although the world generally demanded liberation during the middle period, unequal treaties could not be abolished, and Japan even intensified its ambition to monopolize. The harm caused by the remaining feudal forces and imperialists in the past ten years was due to the many adverse obstacles in their background and environment. However, tracing the root cause, it was also due to the laissez-faire and passive attitude of our Chinese people, inheriting the old mentality of hoping for governance and receiving grace, and failing to be self-reliant and self-sufficient, and to work together with concerted effort.</p>
<p>It was not until the thirteenth year of the Republic of China that the general public gradually became moved by the Premier's sincerity for the country, recognized the Premier's ambition for the nation, and came to believe in the Premier's principles and accept the Premier's strategies. Our National Revolutionary Army fought for the principles and for the revolution, pacified Guangdong, and conducted the Northern Expedition against the warlords. Our National Government was established in central Guangdong and moved the capital to Nanjing. All of this not only created an unprecedented situation in our national history, but was also the key to the survival, revival, and revitalization of the Republic of China. Fortunately, with the support of the people and the bravery of the soldiers, the stubborn enemies of the Northern Warlords and the rebellion of the communist bandits were swept away, and we saw again the prosperity of a unified Republic of China.</p>
<p>However, since the unification three years ago, with the end of military affairs and the beginning of political tutelage, we should have progressed step by step, planning our success on a daily basis. Why have the wars intensified year after year, rebellions arisen one after another, disasters occurred repeatedly, and bandits spread everywhere? Adding to this the impact of the high price of gold and the low price of silver, commodity prices have soared and the people's livelihood has been devastated, causing our people to fall into unbearable suffering. Examining the cause of this disaster, it is the great enemy of the remaining feudal forces. Those rebels like Feng, Yan, Tang, Gui, and Zhang, inherited the erroneous ideas of the warlords, and were manipulated by politicians, willingly acting as leaders of the rebellion, destroying unification, and turning a settled situation into chaos. The people awaiting relief have fallen back into the abyss. How much have these rebels harmed the party and the country by betraying the revolution?</p>
<p>The methods of nation-building that the Premier demonstrated to us are extremely clear and precise. Without economic construction, there is no way to establish the foundation of the nation. Without political construction, there is no way to stabilize the nation's situation. The construction of politics must first consolidate the unity of the country and maintain the peace of the country, so that we can then follow the law and abide by the system, and then educate the people with politics and establish a foundation. This rule of law and democratic politics is what our people urgently desire to obtain now. However, democracy cannot coexist with warlords, and the rule of law cannot coexist with private military forces. We must first make the military force the military force of the country, and then there can be talk of the rule of law. We must first ensure that the people are not subject to the warlords' exploitation, and then we can see the power of democracy. Therefore, the basic condition for unity is that military force is not privately owned, and the basic condition for peace is that there are no warlords causing chaos in the country. The two are interconnected, one and two, two and one.</p>
<p>Fortunately, as we commemorate the National Day of the nineteenth year, those rebels who are destroying unity and peace are already seeing their day of gradual extinction. The signs of a prosperous year for our Republic of China have also appeared. The urgent problems to be solved at present are: how to eliminate banditry in various places so that the people can live and work in peace and the society can have days of stability; how to reorganize the army to reduce the burden on the country and give finance an opportunity to be consolidated; how to prevent reactionaries in order to maintain long-term security and allow the country to make progress in construction. We certainly hope that the central government can skillfully guide the situation in accordance with the times and help with difficult politics, but we still need our Chinese people to rise up together with concerted efforts to plan and share it together.</p>
<p>But Mingshu still has something to say. Given the vastness of our country's land, the complexity of its history, the backwardness of its economy, the intricacy of its international relations, and the weakness and unevenness of the people's political awareness, all of these are sufficient to affect the unity and peace of the country. Moreover, in recent years, although the progress of the national revolution and the suppression of rebellions and reactionaries have relied on the support of the people, it is the revolutionary army that has been the main force. Furthermore, the extent to which the troops across the country adhere to the principles and are determined to revolutionize is not universally equal. All of these undeniable facts are issues that we must not overlook when studying the current political process. Military affairs are essentially tools of politics. There has never been a case where military affairs were the foundation and politics the end, and the country could be managed well. Nor has there ever been a case where military affairs were the foundation and politics the end, and the military did not fall into ruin. Tracing the progress and obstacles of our country's revolution in recent years, we have relied on the struggle of the core forces of the revolutionary army. Therefore, after the obstacles have been removed, we should establish the core forces of politics to consolidate its foundation. But how to establish the core forces of politics to consolidate its foundation? To sum up, one is the relationship between military and political affairs, and the other is politics itself. In terms of the relationship between military and political affairs, it is nothing more than the separation of military and political affairs, and the division of military districts and political regions must not be mixed. If political officials are added to the bodies of active military personnel, and the provinces are governed as rewards for military achievements, Mingshu has repeatedly appealed to the central government, bitterly pointing out its advantages and disadvantages. Even for Mingshu personally, in the past, I have repeatedly declined to accept the position of chairman of Guangdong Province. Later, although I was grateful to the central government for allowing me to relinquish my military command and devote myself solely to provincial administration, I am constantly vigilant about this day and night. It is true that the army is the vanguard of the revolution and the mainstay of the country, responsible for protecting the country and defending the people. If they abandon this to engage in politics, the superiors will follow suit, and the military will inevitably become corrupt and unusable. Moreover, politics is the management of the affairs of the multitude, which is extremely complex and constantly changing. Military personnel may not all have this training and patience. Because of its complexity and constant change, everyone's views and actions will inevitably have differences of opinion. If the debate over right and wrong is resolved by the victory or defeat of military force, then the danger is indescribable. Therefore, the principle that military officers must not concurrently hold civil posts and that military personnel must not interfere in politics has always been regarded as the golden rule of politics in ancient and modern times. Moreover, our country is now suffering from the evil influence of warlord autocracy, and even in various parts of the country today, there are still undeniable remnants. We must learn from the past and be careful in the future, and learn from the past to know the future. The principle of the separation of military and political affairs is a crucial plan that we must not delay in the future. Although there is no shortage of talented people among the active military personnel in the country who deeply understand the national system, the central government should also relieve them of their military duties, and then appoint them to political positions, eliminating abuses and assigning responsibilities. As for the revolutionary army officers and soldiers who adhere to the principles and are most determined to revolutionize, they should set an example and establish a model to correct the customs of the world, sacrificing the small and temporary interests of the moment to seek the long-term interests of the country. The military force that saves the people and the country should always be used as a tool to defend the country and quell chaos. As for the division of military districts and administrative regions that must not be mixed, the principle is very clear. Originally, the division of military districts in a country must be based on the needs of national power and national defense, while the division of administrative regions is based on administrative convenience and historical habits. The two must not be mixed, otherwise using the military to govern politics will still follow the old path of warlords, creating individual territorial forces and forming a situation of feudal separatism. Not only will the political authority of the central government have no way to be established, but also the life of local politics will be destroyed. Examining the extent of its abuses, tax revenue is controlled by them, officials are manipulated by them, and the judiciary is arbitrarily decided by them. Even the supply, training, and deployment of the army cannot be thoroughly managed and supervised by the central government. Gradually, it will inevitably lead to a situation where there is no politics to speak of in the country, and there is no army to use. Therefore, military districts and political regions must be divided separately and not mixed. The army receives supplies from the central government, strictly investigates military needs, and forms the country's military force, contributing every drop to the public treasury. The army is subject to the central government's control, transferring defenses and conscripting, in order to fulfill its fundamental duty of protecting the country and quelling chaos, and to prevent the evils of interfering in administration. As for maintaining the usual local security, the local governments at all levels are ordered to set up corresponding security teams and directly command them to respond to emergencies. It is necessary to concentrate military power first, and then there can be talk of the expansion of politics. It is necessary to fix military power first, and then there is the possibility of establishing political power. This is the subtle meaning of the separation of military and political affairs and the division of military districts and administrative regions that must not be mixed.</p>
<p>How can we talk about politics itself? The establishment of the core forces of politics in itself, externally, should eliminate the obstacles left by military actions in the historical process of peace and revolution. However, in politics itself, we must establish the prestige of politics and demonstrate the effectiveness of politics. Without effectiveness, there is no prestige. Without prestige, there is no effectiveness. Without effectiveness and prestige, the people cannot build faith, and the authority of the government is difficult to exercise. The essence of political tutelage is nothing more than the two aspects of the rule of law and democracy. In recent years, the central government has formulated laws and regulations and promulgated them one after another, which has already taken on a rough scale. If governments at all levels can implement them unremittingly, they can easily be guided into the right track of the rule of law, and eliminate the bad habits of disorder, emptiness, and corruption. Although the laws and regulations are already slightly prepared, the newly established laws value implementation first. There must be the sincerity to abide by the law and the courage to enforce the law, so that the effect of the new law can be seen. The agencies and officials that enforce the law should especially seek to be sound and agile. Therefore, the agencies must seek to be simple, and the powers must seek to be specialized. Set up an agency, then seek the use of an agency, do not set up redundant and useless agencies because of people, and do not hinder the progress of the cause because of agencies. Establish an agency, then give it specialized powers, do not add extra-legal constraints because of people, and do not cause one thing to be impossible to do because of extra-legal constraints. Only then can each agency be equal to a part of the entire organism, each fulfilling its responsibilities, each benefiting its use, like the arm directing the hand, and the hand directing the finger. As for the appointment of officials, public examinations and performance-based assessments are certainly the only way. However, the use of examinations can only test academic knowledge. As for their talent, experience, and morality, it is not something that can be known in one examination. Therefore, even if those who pass the examination should be required to learn and use it for inspection, and then they should be promoted to lower positions and promoted step by step. In addition to examinations, we should also select the virtuous and appoint the capable to help them. Our governments at all levels have always advertised themselves as being honest and upright. Corruption is indeed a major problem of our past governments. However, even if we can only achieve the two words of honesty now, if we have no talent and no courage, and we cannot do one thing well, and we do not seek to do one thing well, then how can we have done all the government can do? Therefore, the talents who implement the new laws and new policies must be appointed by people who are knowledgeable and capable, and who are aware of shame and self-discipline. Only then can the new laws and new policies have hope of being implemented. In addition, given the lack of talents in the country and the frequent political changes in the past, it also seems that we should widen the doors to officialdom. If their talents are usable, and the people are not the chief rebels, in accordance with the Premier's spirit of serving the public, we should diligently search for and generously give them a chance to reform themselves to assist in governance, not only limited to party members and those close to important figures. As for the promotion of democracy, this is the foundation of political tutelage, and it is also the only way for our country to change its politics in the future. The Premier took the county as the unit of autonomy, not only wanting to realize the realization of civil rights, but also wanting to eliminate the root of the disease that has been from top to bottom for thousands of years, which is easy to become feudal, to protect the foundation of county governance, to consolidate the use of civil rights, to prevent the abuse of excessive provincial rights, and to create a new era in our country's politics. However, although the autonomy of county governance is a crucial system, according to the habits and psychology of the people and the administrative steps of the country, it is not something that can be achieved overnight. Negatively speaking, we should not allow obstacles to governing politics with the military, officials who disregard the law and harm the people, and neglect their duties and disrupt politics, and bandits who harass the villages, rob wealth, and injure lives. However, positively speaking, there must also be various preparatory work such as clearing up household registration, measuring land, and compulsory literacy. There must also be sound county governments and staff who can enlighten and assist the people's ability to govern themselves. Otherwise, good people will not want to interfere in other people's affairs, while local tyrants, evil gentry, rioters, and rogues will take the opportunity of autonomy to wreak havoc in the meantime. There is no practical benefit of autonomy, but the good name of autonomy is ruined. Moreover, what the Premier showed us is that the construction of politics and economy must go hand in hand. Without the construction of people's livelihood and society, there is no foundation for a democratic society. Therefore, how to equalize land rights so that tillers can have their fields, and how to reward agriculture and industry so that people's lives can have the possibility of improvement are all important plans for political tutelage. As for the protection of the people's legal freedom and rights, it is the most urgent task of political tutelage. If the people do not have legal freedom and rights, then people are no longer people, and what civil rights and people's livelihood can be said? People all know the loveliness of private freedom and rights, but why do people often sacrifice the freedom and rights of others regardless? This is especially hoped that our central government will formulate great laws and strictly order military and political officials at all levels to implement them faithfully, and also hope that the people of the whole country will be able to understand and cherish them. In short, the above-mentioned two aspects of the rule of law and democracy are related to the prestige and effectiveness of politics itself, and are also what the people of the whole country urgently desire. Without this, the core forces of politics cannot be established. If we do not urgently establish the core forces of politics, we cannot promote the unity and construction of the country. As the saying goes, if the superiors have laws, the inferiors have rules. This cannot but be hoped that our central government will set an example to be a model, and properly plan good strategies to assist in implementation. Historically, the reactionaries who reversed the situation have no real power in themselves. They often use the failure of the authorities' politics as their precursor. It is said that it collapses from within rather than from external forces.</p>
<p>There is still one word for my Cantonese people. Mingshu has been appointed as chairman of the government since November of the seventeenth year, and it has been almost two years now. Speaking of the relationship between military and political affairs, fortunately, the generals and soldiers of the Eighth Route Army are public-spirited and patriotic. Not only is there no suspicion of governing politics with the military, but they often benefit from the division of labor and cooperation. As for politics itself, I feel worried and pained every day. Tracing the location of the root cause, it is the entanglement in promoting unification, which has led to financial exhaustion and the difficulty of doing everything. The Gui system warlords, based in their nests, have repeatedly invaded our Guangdong. In April of the eighteenth year, there was the attack of the Gui system and the obstruction of Xu. By September, Zhang and Gui joined forces and invaded with all their strength. Our generals and soldiers of the Eighth Route Army have been fighting and chasing them to this day, without rest. Mingshu thought about the meaning of promoting unification, defending the territory, and securing the people, and almost every moment, I used all my political power to help the progress of the military. It is true that if we want to seek the unification of the country, it is difficult to sit idly by and watch the Gui system and Zhang's rebellion. If we want to protect the security of Guangdong, it is difficult to tolerate the invasion of the warlords of neighboring provinces. We do not want to occupy anything in Gui Province, or to exploit anything from the people of Gui. We are doing this for the sake of the country, for the sake of our Guangdong, and for the sake of the interests of the people of Gui Province. However, due to the frequency of military campaigns, the finance has become difficult. According to the Guangdong Province's total net income of national and provincial affairs in the seventeenth year, it was about 80.5 million yuan, and the total net expenditure was about 74.7 million yuan. At that time, the income was more than it is now, and the expenditure was less than it is now. However, in the seventeenth year, in terms of the total number of regular and miscellaneous receipts and expenditures, there was already a state of not being able to make ends meet. Since February of the eighteenth year, the monthly income of the two-five surtax and the kerosene special tax was estimated to be about 1.3 million yuan. It was "assigned to the customs to handle concurrently, and included in the customs surplus, directly remitted to the central government." In March, the national and provincial treasuries were divided. At first, only five kinds of taxes, namely salt, regular customs, stamp, tobacco and alcohol, and cigarette unified tax, were set as national taxes, with a monthly income of about 1.2 million yuan. In June, four kinds of taxes, namely Lijin (including parcel post tax), sugar tax, tobacco prohibition income, and explosive income, were added to the national treasury, with a monthly income estimated to be about 1.5 million yuan, and the military, cultural, and party expenses that should be borne by the state, as well as the financial reorganization fund, were entrusted to the national treasury to bear. Therefore, the net income of the provincial treasury in the eighteenth year was only about 36 million yuan, while the net income of the national treasury was 32 million yuan. However, the net expenditure of the provincial treasury was only 16.4 million yuan, while the net expenditure of the national treasury was about 51.8 million yuan. This is because, due to the suppression of the rebellion in one year, in the eighteenth year, the average monthly amount of military expenditure alone was more than 4.1 million yuan, exceeding the net income of the national treasury by about 17.3 million yuan. The amount of the national treasury's deficit was borrowed from the provincial treasury. From March to September of the eighteenth year, more than 11.8 million yuan had been borrowed. From October of the eighteenth year to the first half of September of the nineteenth year, another more than 21.14 million yuan was borrowed. The provincial treasury was still in deficit, so it came to pre-collecting land taxes and Lijin taxes, issuing military treasury bonds, and organizing industrial land leases. Almost all methods that could raise money were used. With such a burdened finance, how can we expect the creation of active undertakings? I must mention all the difficulties of suppressing the rebellion and finance to the Cantonese people. As for other affairs, tracing back to the beginning of Mingshu's tenure, I once encouraged the members of the provincial government to abide by the law and be open, selfless, and unreserved. In the past two years, in terms of civil affairs, people were selected and appointed using examinations. There was no way to obtain an official position through bribery, and no way to receive a position through power and private affection. All officials who have achieved a little success have respected their positions and made them last in their positions, and they have been promoted from simple vacancies to busy vacancies. If a corrupt official is encountered, once discovered, they will be severely dismissed and punished, with no favoritism. In terms of finance, monthly receipts and expenditures are announced, no new taxes have been introduced, and the taxes and Lijin on wheat flour, silkworm cocoons, and native cloth, the soil platform, the paper handle and other platform Lijin, and the additional donations on railways, electric lights, and hotels have been reduced and exempted one after another. Compared with the seventeenth year, the monthly receipt is reduced by about 200,000 yuan. As for the construction funds, about highways, agriculture, industry, and fishing industries, and cement plants, the expenditure in the eighteenth year also increased by about 2 million yuan compared with the previous year. The education expenditure also increased by about 400,000 yuan. Although there is no great goodness to be mentioned, I have tried my best to relieve the difficulties of rescuing and eliminating abuses, and to express my intention to promote industry and encourage education. We must learn from the past and be careful in the future, and study the direction of future governance. How to increase the funding for county governance and organize local autonomy, how to formulate budgets and reorganize taxes, how to reorganize land and implement Lijin, how to complete highways and promote literacy, how to eliminate banditry and consolidate security, and how to implement gambling bans and eliminate bad habits are certainly the responsibilities of the government, but I also hope that the people of the whole province will plan together to support it. It is important to know that the wealth of the people of Guangdong Province mostly relies on the remittances of overseas Chinese, the government's income is often taken from troublesome tax items, the harm of bandits is often due to the proliferation of private robberies, and the difficulties of the local area are often easily seen in the oppression of local bullies. If this is not governed, it cannot be a province. The first problem to be solved is the strict division of provincial and national taxes, the separate burden of political and military expenses, and the clear division of powers and responsibilities between the central and local governments. This is the urgent plan for provincial governance at present. Other things, such as promoting the completion of the Yuehan Railway, helping the construction of Zhongshan Port, using the available capital of overseas Chinese, establishing a scale of economic construction, making the first step in political tutelage, and seeking a model for construction, will greatly and permanently benefit the country and society. This is especially hoped that the wisdom and ambition of the people of the whole province and overseas Chinese will plan together to achieve it.</p>
<p>As we commemorate the National Day, let us think about the difficulty of building the Republic of China and the urgent need for the construction of the Republic of China. I have listed several points to serve as a basis for discussion. There is no success that can be achieved by luck, and there is no hope that can be too extravagant. What I hope is that our compatriots will be self-reliant, and will plan together and work together to share the responsibility and share the success. The blessings of the Premier and the martyrs, the expectations of people around the world, and the future of generations to come all depend on our efforts to seek self-improvement today, all depend on our efforts to seek self-improvement today.

<p>Important News on Education</p>
<h3>Central University Students' Movement to Improve School Affairs</h3>
<p>▲ Letter to Faculty and Students</p>
<p>▲ Proposing Measures to Improve School Affairs</p>
<p>▲ President Agrees to Consider in Detail</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Central University students Tu Juyao, Yu Daonan, Zou Huai, and over two hundred and ninety others, citing the school's recent internal corruption and disorganization in school affairs, jointly addressed a letter to all faculty and students today, detailing various major problems that have recently occurred: (1) Dean Issues: Out of the eight colleges, the deans of the Colleges of Arts, Sciences, Law, and Education have all resigned. Although the deans of the Colleges of Agriculture and Engineering have been appointed, they have not officially arrived at the school to take office. Only the Colleges of Medicine and Commerce in Shanghai have formal deans. (2) The College of Science, known for its excellent performance, has collectively decided to strike due to dissatisfaction with the school's measures. (3) All faculty members of the Department of Botany have resigned due to various difficulties. To date, the department head only agrees to teach in a private capacity. (4) The new Secretary-General, Lu Shusen, resigned shortly after taking office because all reform plans could not be implemented. (5) The Biology Building, built with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, has not been accepted by the project audit committee due to improper measures by those in charge, and so on. They then proposed specific improvement plans as follows: (1) Secretary-General Zhang Zuoshi should be immediately dismissed for deceiving the President, controlling the school, abusing administrative and economic power, insulting professors, and engaging in embezzlement and bribery. (2) The Secretary's Office has excessive power, often overstepping its authority. Universities of similar size to Central University, such as Sun Yat-sen University and Peking University, do not have this organization, and it should be abolished immediately. (3) Administrative staff occupy two-thirds of the school affairs meeting, while professor representatives only occupy one-third, which violates the principle of professors governing the school. The school's internal disorganization stems from this. (4) According to the resolutions of the National Education Conference, school administrative expenses should not exceed 5% to 10% of the total expenses. Currently, the school's administrative expenses total 313,000 yuan, nearly 17% of the total expenses, which not only sets an unprecedented example for national universities but also violates the resolutions of the National Education Conference. It should be reduced immediately, and the funds should be increased for library equipment. (5) Each college's funding should be independent to avoid being controlled by the General Affairs Department and increasing opportunities for corruption. (6) School finances should be effectively disclosed after the General Affairs and Accounting Departments' many shady dealings, in order to live up to the state's intention to cultivate the school. (7) Sun Yat-sen University, Peking University, Wuhan University, and other universities have two to three times as many full-time professors as Central University. More full-time professors should be hired to avoid students frequently feeling regret that they want to learn but have no way to do so. (8) Wuhan University and Peking University do not charge dormitory fees or lecture fees, and Central University should follow suit. Furthermore, it is reported that National Central University has eight colleges: Arts, Sciences, Law, Education, Engineering, Agriculture, Commerce, and Medicine. Except for the Colleges of Commerce and Medicine located in Shanghai, which have deans, the six colleges in Nanjing only have the Dean of the College of Engineering, Chen Maojie, and the Dean of the College of Agriculture, Zou Bingwen, who both hold other important positions concurrently and rarely come to the school to work. The deans of the remaining four colleges—Arts, Sciences, Law, and Education—have not been appointed to this day. (Although the school authorities have asked Ai Wei to serve as acting Dean of the College of Education and Liu Shuqi to serve as acting Dean of the College of Science, both Ai and Liu have firmly declined.) Furthermore, due to the school's financial difficulties, faculty and staff salaries have only been paid up to the first half of August. Senior students Tu Juyao and others, seeing the school's decline, specially issued a declaration to improve school affairs yesterday (the 15th), which was about 4,000 words long. It fully described the school's recent situation and strongly criticized Secretary-General Zhang Hengzhi for improperly monopolizing all administrative power of the school. As a result, Zhang resigned from his position as Secretary-General but not from his position as Secretary, taking responsibility for his actions. Yesterday, President Zhang earnestly tried to persuade Secretary Zhang to stay. The school's disputes are currently surging.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 16th Telegram: Central University President Zhang Naiyan has agreed to carefully consider the measures to improve school affairs proposed by students Xu Juyao and others.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Telegraphs to Retain Luo Jialun</h3>
<p>▲ Zhou Binglin Acts as President of Tsinghua University</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education telegraphed both Peking and Wuhan to retain Luo Jialun, the President of Tsinghua University. The two telegrams are recorded below: (1) To the Tsinghua University School Affairs Meeting and Professor Zhou Binglin, Peking: President Luo is temporarily unable to return to the school. Professor Zhou Binglin is hereby appointed to act as President. Seal of the Ministry of Education. (2) To Wuhan National Wuhan University, forwarding to Tsinghua University President Luo: The President's management of Tsinghua University has been remarkably effective and should continue to be strived for. However, since he is temporarily unable to return to the school, Professor Zhou Binglin is temporarily appointed by the Ministry to act as President. It is still hoped that he will return to Peking as soon as possible to preside over everything. Seal of the Ministry of Education.</p>

<h3>Xu Peihuang Takes Office as Acting Director of the Municipal Education Bureau</h3>
<p>▲ Arrived at the Bureau at 10:00 AM Yesterday</p>
<p>The Daily News reports that Chen Dezheng, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, has been detained in Peking due to a case and has not yet been released. Mayor Zhang believes that municipal education is extremely important and cannot be without a leader for a single day. The day before yesterday, he specially appointed Xu Peihuang, a City Government Advisor, to temporarily act as Director of the Bureau. Yesterday morning, Xu arrived at the Bureau to take office. The Daily News reporter paid a special visit to interview him. Xu said briefly, "Yesterday (the 15th) at around 3:00 PM, I suddenly received an order from Mayor Zhang to act as Director of this position. Therefore, I have not yet prepared any plans for the improvement of municipal education. However, the Mayor attaches great importance to municipal education. After receiving the order, I could not delay taking office, so as not to violate the Mayor's emphasis on education. Therefore, I arrived at the Bureau at 10:00 AM this morning and had a brief conversation with the staff at 11:00 AM. The staff will remain as they are, with absolutely no changes. However, one thing I can tell you is that the city government's annual revenue totals six million yuan, and the annual allocation for education is over one million yuan, accounting for about one-quarter. This is clear evidence of Mayor Zhang's emphasis on education. My intention is that the citizens spend over one million yuan on education annually, and there must be results worth over one million yuan in return. That is, every penny spent on education must yield a penny's worth of results. Only in this way can we live up to the citizens of Shanghai and the city government's great intention to promote education."</p>
<p>Another report: Xu Junye arrived at the Bureau at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 16th) to take over. He immediately summoned all Bureau staff for a speech, stating briefly that the Director's issue had arisen suddenly. The city government's appointment of his brother to act as Director was also a temporary measure. Therefore, his brother came here alone today, hoping that everyone would work with peace of mind. It is said that Xu Jun only brought one seal custodian with him to the Bureau.</p>

<h3>A Record of the First Day of Fudan University's 25th Anniversary Celebration</h3>
<p>▲ Yesterday's Exhibition and Ball Games</p>
<p>▲ Grand Ceremony Today</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 16th) was the first day of Fudan University's 25th anniversary celebration in Jiangwan, Shanghai. In the morning, there was an exhibition of achievements, and in the afternoon, there were basketball, volleyball, and soccer games. On this day, the school's front and back gates, Zibin Court, Jian Gong Hall, Library, Gymnasium, and various dormitories were decorated with lanterns and colored streamers, creating a magnificent and splendid scene. Being in it made people feel as if they were in a unique and grand setting. The most important aspects are briefly recorded below. The library's upstairs display included the school's awards, flags, trophies, and other items won over the past 25 years, totaling dozens of types. The downstairs display included various specimens from the Commercial Museum and photographic achievements from the Photography Society. The third floor of Zibin Court displayed various specimens, instruments, medicines, and animal and mineral models from the Department of Biology. The second floor displayed various comparative tables of the strength of various toxic gases, diagrams of toxic gas manufacturing machinery, tables of injuries suffered by soldiers of various countries during the European War, and various anti-gas equipment, totaling more than a dozen items. The downstairs was a reception room for guests. From morning to evening, there was an endless stream of visitors, totaling more than three thousand people. In the evening, Peking opera was performed. The actors were extraordinary, and the audience applauded enthusiastically. The gymnasium was packed with people, with hardly any room to stand. It did not close until 2:00 AM.</p>
<p>Today (the 17th) morning, guests and alumni from all walks of life were invited and the following five publications were distributed: 1. 25th Anniversary Commemorative Album, 2. Special Issue Celebrating the 25th Anniversary, 3. 1930 Graduation Commemorative Publication, 4. 25th Anniversary Commemorative Publication of the Business Society, 5. News World published by the Department of Journalism. Those traveling to the school from Shanghai North Station or Gongyuan Bazichang today can take the China Merchants Public Bus to Xuzhi Company and transfer to the school's own special bus, which will take them directly to the school gate. At 9:00 AM, the school's student army held a review ceremony. They were armed with real guns and had a disciplined military appearance. The ceremony was extremely grand. At noon, there was a gathering for lunch at the school's own consumer cooperative. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, a commemorative ceremony was held. It was presided over by Ma Xiangbo, the 91-year-old founder, and honorary degrees were awarded. Yu Youren, Shao Lizi, Qian Xinzhi, Sun Wenben, Wang Yunwu, Zhu Yingpeng, and Xi Yushu all went to participate. Administrative officials from Peking and Shanghai, as well as representatives from various institutions, also attended the ceremony. After the ceremony, there was a national defense chemistry performance. According to this performance, there were originally many programs, but they were strictly deleted to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world. The remaining items were a candle-style smoke screen and tear gas. (1) Candle-style smoke screen: A large number of smoke candles were arranged in a row and ignited simultaneously, so that the smoke produced connected to form a screen. This is called a candle-style smoke screen. The candle is made of iron sheet and contains zinc powder, vaporized gas, and potassium carbonate. Pulling the mechanism on the top of the candle immediately ignites it. After about a minute, a large amount of dense white smoke is produced. The military uses it to avoid the enemy's line of sight, so that it can advance and retreat freely. This performance used a total of forty devices, and it is expected that the white smoke will last for at least thirty minutes. (2) Tear gas: Poison gas is too dangerous and inconvenient to perform. Tear gas is relatively safe. In the usual dangerous concentration of poison gas, it does not cause much harm to the human body except for the eyes. The performance used bromoketone, which is usually made in poison gas class. A dog was tested, and its eyes immediately teared up. Ordinary chemistry performances were also continued. The purpose was to instill a kind of chemical knowledge in society and at the same time have a magical quality to increase the audience's interest. In the evening, there was a musical concert. The main programs included the Coronation March from Le Prophète, Russian folk songs, and The Beautiful Maiden of the White Silk Region, totaling more than a dozen pieces, as well as a new drama performance. Tomorrow afternoon, there will be an amusement fair with many programs and twelve kinds of colorful fireworks to be lit in the evening.</p>
<h3>Completion Ceremony of the New Building of Fudan University Affiliated High School</h3>
<p>▲ Ma Xiangbo, Zhu Yingpeng, and Others Give Speeches</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 16th) was the day of the completion ceremony of the new building of Fudan University Affiliated High School in Shanghai. The bells rang nine times. The attendees included Ma Xiangbo, graduate alumni Tang Boqi, Zhang Xihe, Zhu Yingpeng, Zhang Tinghao, Liu Bainian, Cao Liangxia, Hu Dunfu, and professors from the university department of the school, including Zhang Yousan, Jin Tongyin, Yu Nanqiu, Qian Zuling, Wen Chongxin, and others, totaling seven or eight hundred people. The ceremony was presided over by Mao Xibi, a teacher at the school. Bao Huaibai respectfully read the will. After completing the formalities, Chairman Ma Xiangbo stood up and gave an opening speech, stating briefly, "Fudan has a history of twenty-five years since its founding. The school was originally located in Wusong, but it was moved because it was used by the Shanghai-Wusong authorities. It was moved to the Li Gong Ancestral Hall on Haige Road. It is very appropriate to run education on public land. The students are in this good environment of fresh air and elegant scenery, and it is also the occasion of the completion of the new building. They should know how to encourage themselves. Looking at the Germans' occupation of Qingdao for no more than thirty years, all the streets and houses were solemn and splendid. The precision of their construction may have exceeded that of Shanghai. After the Japanese forcibly seized it, its municipal administration was also quite impressive. However, since our country took over the administration, the results have been regressing. This is because one has the spirit of perseverance and creation, and the other does not. Since the twenty-second year of Daoguang (1842 AD) until today, our country has been in a state of internal and external troubles. After human disasters, there have been natural disasters. Since I founded Shen Bao, I have read it every year and there is no year without news of disasters and famines. China, which has always been known as an agricultural country, has recently had tens of thousands of stones of Japanese rice imported into the market. It is very painful to say this. The aggression of the imperialists has been going on for a long time, causing the beautiful rivers and mountains to be eroded day by day. But our people have only awakened from their dreams today. This is probably like a mediocre and incompetent householder who waits until the thieves have emptied the boxes and chests and left before shouting loudly that he has been robbed and catching thieves. Isn't it too late? Fudan has a difficult history of twenty-five years of construction. In this bad environment of increasingly deteriorating national affairs, the students should work hard and emulate the German spirit of creation to transform society and save the country, so as not to betray our expectations." Then, Yin Yiwen, the director of the school, reported on the process of building the new building. Then, the guest Zhu Yingpeng gave a speech, stating briefly, "The purpose of studying should be to transform society and the country. The method of transformation must have collective morality and cultivate the habit of being organized, disciplined, and able to find a way out for the nation. I hope that you can pay attention to this during your studies, so that you can talk about transforming society and the country." Finally, Zhang Tinghao, Zhang Yousan, Tang Boqi, Zhang Xihe, Cao Liangxia, and others gave speeches.</p>

<h3>Order of Events for the Municipal First Public Stadium Athletic Meet</h3>
<p>For the athletic meet to be held at the Municipal First Public Stadium on the 19th, one-third of the athletes went to collect their number cloths yesterday. Tonight, they should be able to collect them all. At 6:00 PM, a referees' meeting will be held to arrange the order of events. It was also resolved that the 1,500-meter race with 69 participants and the 3,000-meter race with 56 participants were too crowded and narrow, and that without a preliminary round, the running would be crowded and dangerous, and it would be extremely difficult to referee. If a preliminary round were added, the long-distance runners would have to run several times in one day, which may not be within their physical capabilities. If the preliminary round were held a day earlier, most athletes would not be able to attend due to their occupations. Therefore, they were divided into three groups for the final. The times of the top four in each group were recorded, and the four with the highest scores out of the twelve were selected. This is also a method of adapting to the circumstances. The order of events is recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ Starting at 8:00 AM</p>
<p>(1) 100-meter preliminary and semi-final (2) 800-meter preliminary (3) Shot put (4) 200-meter preliminary and semi-final (5) 1,500-meter final (6) 110-meter low hurdle preliminary (7) High jump (8) 400-meter preliminary</p>

<h3>The Remote Causes and Immediate Effects of This Overseas Expedition’s Stranding (1) by Yu Hengzhi</h3>
<p>That ship, flying the banner of "overseas expedition" and cherishing the lofty ambition of touring Europe and America, has now run aground midway. Whether it can be dragged off the dangerous shoal and continue its unfinished voyage, fulfilling its unrealized aspirations, is a big question.</p>
<p>I am one of the initiators of this expedition. I am much more aware of the details of the expedition than others. The reasons for this stranding are of course as clear as the palm of my hand. However, at first, I thought that the facts of this matter had mostly been revealed in Mr. Li Huitang's diary and other writings. Repetitive explanations could be avoided if possible, so I initially adopted the principle of keeping silent and slowly planning my next move.</p>
<p>However, recently, after the expedition team returned to Shanghai, it attracted a great deal of attention from all walks of life, and also stirred up endless disputes. A few days ago, Mr. Xu Zhendong, a keen supporter of sports, even made a long speech that seemed right but was not quite. Therefore, in order to avoid filling the people who support the sports community with doubts, and to seek the complete exposure of true right and wrong, I now simply reveal the facts of this matter from beginning to end.</p>
<p>To seek clarity from all walks of life, I will first start with the motivation for the expedition.</p>
<p>I remember that I had previously informed the outside world that the motivation for the expedition was as early as four years ago. In the military medical team stationed in Shanghai, there was a Mr. Harris, who was also a representative attending the Shanghai Football Association. His relationship with Lihua was also very harmonious. Later, he was transferred back to his country. It happened that in 1928, Lihua's performance was very outstanding, winning both the annual shield for Group A and the Group A cup. Therefore, when he was about to leave, he said that he would definitely find a way to give Lihua the opportunity to tour Europe (please note, readers, that it was Lihua touring Europe, not the Chinese team).</p>
<p>He did indeed start working in England. Moreover, he cooperated with Sir Wollu, the secretary of the English Football Association, and lobbied everywhere in England. Finally, he went to various European countries to work. Until last year, things gradually showed some signs of progress. When Fulehua first征爪哇 (Unable to Translate: first expedition to Java) and departed from Surabaya, he actually sent a telegram to invite them, saying that the first match had been scheduled in Vienna, Austria. Later, we discussed that in that hurried moment, we were not fully prepared for anything. It was impossible to depart for Europe from there. As a result, we replied politely and stated our reasons. Finally, we promised him that we would prepare immediately after returning to Shanghai and prepare to depart next year.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Silian, who has always had a relationship with the Chinese football community, happened to return to Shen from England this spring for a vacation. Because of the Lihua incident, he had discussed many methods with Harris in England. Therefore, all subsequent telegrams were handled through him. Until April this year, both parties reached a very satisfactory agreement. The British and European sides had agreed to a considerable guarantee fee for each match. According to our budget, if there were thirty matches, the amount of the guarantee fee could offset the amount of expenses.</p>
<p>With the biggest economic problem solved, we immediately prepared for other things. At first, we originally wanted to deal with it purely with Lihua's strength. Later, we felt that there were always weaknesses in strength. At the same time, Hong Kong newspapers also had sincere comments saying that it would be best to increase combat power. Therefore, we decided to adopt the best talents and change Lihua's name to the Chinese Overseas Expedition Football Team (not the Chinese national team, please do not misunderstand).</p>
<p>The overseas expedition of Chinese football teams has long been known to all walks of life to have predecessors. We proceeded with the aim of following precedents, and contacted each player privately as before. Simple and reasonable treatment was also decided by the Lihua Association and was the same as the method of the 1927 Australian expedition team. We contacted the players privately based on two understandings: (A) The previous trip to Australia was also a private contact, and the trip to Australia went smoothly, so it should be best to follow the example; (B) We feel that the players in our country are all amateur athletes, and their actions are free and are not subject to any association's jurisdiction (to be continued)</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>▲Son (returning from school, asks his mother.)—Mother. Today we read zoology. According to the teacher, humans are descended from monkeys. So am I a descendant of monkeys?</p>
<p>Mother—I don't know. I have never met your father's ancestors. Wait a while for your father to come back and ask him.</p>
<p>▲A (very proudly to his friend.)—I have so many lovers. Any woman will fall in love with me at first sight.</p>
<p>B—That's all because your face is so beautiful.</p>
<p>A—I don't know why, but they often give me gifts. Look, this cigarette case is so exquisite. This is a gift from my latest lover. (Shows his friend a cigarette case.)</p>
<p>B—Really. It couldn't be more exquisite. Your lover is also very thoughtful. Your portrait is also engraved on the lid of the box. Look, isn't this clearly a small golden turtle?</p>
<p>▲A—My friend. Do you know? When good luck comes, it will often knock on your door.</p>
<p>B—Yes. He also knocked on my door once. It just so happened that I was not at home and did not invite him in. The next day he sent his younger brother to see me.</p>
<p>A—That's strange. Does good luck have a younger brother?</p>
<p>B—Yes. His younger brother is bad luck.</p>
<h3>Closing Ceremony Highlights of the National Goods Movement Conference</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The Shanghai Third National Goods Movement Conference. Because the fashion exhibition held on the 9th focused on the female community. It failed to fully demonstrate the advantages of national silk. Therefore, it gathered exquisite silks from all over the country. At the closing ceremony on the 13th of the month. It was also displayed in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. No tickets required. Open to all visitors. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Here are some highlights.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. The Party and national flags are crossed. A red silk banner with gold lettering hangs. The text reads "Shanghai Third National Goods Movement Week National Silk Exhibition". Next to it stand four members of the security team and four patrol officers. Fully armed. Full of energy. On both sides of the aisle. Pictures and slogans are posted everywhere. Some are pictures of train tracks. There are roads to life and roads to death for people to choose from. Some write that the disaster of importing foreign goods is equal to floods. And paint several people falling into the water and dying. Reading it is shocking. A registration desk is set up next to the stone steps. After signing in, guests are given a variety of publicity printed materials. The products of each factory are displayed in front of the conference hall and on the corridors of the three floors. And marked with the factory's products. The value per foot. And the name of the silk, etc., so that people can know it at a glance. The guest seats in the venue. Divided into upstairs and downstairs. Two sets of national silk formal wear made by Yuanyuan Clothing Store are hung on the stage. Male on the left and female on the right. One is a blue robe and black coat. One is an embroidered shirt and pants. All supported by bamboo frames. Like the signboard of a clothing store. At the opening ceremony. The presidium standing under the portrait of the President. All wore brand-new blue robes and black jackets with bright red badges on their chests. Like the groom. The Shanghai Silk Industry Association and the China National Silk Shanghai Relief Association. The "Regulations on the Clothing System of the Republic of China" promulgated by the National Government on April 16, 1929. The full text of three chapters and nine articles. Printed into leaflets. A three-inch square "clothing" character is crowned on the top. And it is noted that if you do not use national goods, you will perish, etc. Distributed to guests. It can be said to be unique. Xianda Shenda Weilon Three Camel Down Factory. Also jointly printed a red letter declaration. Attached with a sample of national Serge. Distributed on the spot. When Pan Gongzhan delivered the opening speech. In addition to advising guests to use national goods. And hope that the attendees will bear the publicity mission. It is said that after the meeting. If you meet relatives and friends. Please advise them to purchase national goods for clothing materials in the future. Wang Yansong reported on behalf of the silk industry. Comparing national goods with foreign goods. Likening it to biological children and other people's children. It is said that not using national goods but buying foreign goods. It is no different from not loving one's own children but loving the children of neighbors. The language is simple and thorough. Everyone nodded. Fan Zhengbo's speech. The responsibility of promoting national goods. Merchants are the most important. If they unanimously do not import foreign goods. Then the people will have no way to buy foreign goods. This is also a way to draw firewood from under the pot. Wang Xiaolai's speech. Standing upright at the entrance of the stage. Hands behind his back. A kind of selfless attitude. Like Bao Gong in the black-headed opera. The voice is like a bell. The listeners are moved. Ye Huijun's speech. Always famous for being funny. On this day, he still spoke the Pudong language. It is said that the Chinese people account for one-quarter of the entire earth. If you can be of one mind and one heart. Hold on to the fact that foreigners offer foreign goods without paying travel expenses. Then, if the country is not rich and the people are strong after three years. I can be responsible for compensating the losses. And it is said that if you still buy and use foreign goods. Loss of rights and interests. I am afraid that foreigners will not only not be grateful. And will regard the Chinese as candles. (Shanghai people scold people.) It's hilarious. After five o'clock. The clothing and other items donated by various factories. Numbered. Displayed in the Changhui room on the third floor. Tickets are sold in the gatehouse. Half a dollar per ticket. Each person is limited to one ticket. All have gifts. The lottery room is located in the reception room on the third floor. Because there are more than 2,000 guests. Only four hundred and thirty. Insufficient distribution. Therefore, it is very crowded. Finally, Lu Xiaowu, Zhang Yeye, Yi Fangshuo, Wang Wuneng and others performed. In the midst of abruptness and humor. Can incorporate the purpose of promoting national goods. Quite meaningful. Pan Gongzhan sat on the stage from beginning to end. Smiling. Very proud. Zhang Zhenyuan took care of it on the stage. Holding a megaphone. Shouting loudly. Reporting the program and maintaining order. Very busy. When the meeting adjourned. It was already dark.</p>
<h3>Autumn News</h3>
<p>— Zheng Manqing</p>
<p>Since last winter, I and my colleagues founded the China Art College on the banks of Fenglin Bridge. I am suffering from school affairs. So that good friends are separated. Old friends in the country. Those who blame me for being too lazy. Books are piled up in boxes. Those who live on the sea but do not meet each other. Also move in a few months. Some suspect that I have traveled far across the ocean. Some suspect that I have entered the forest and have become dense. And I do not know that I study vermilion and kill powder. Years long forget. However, the bright moon teases people. Autumn is half over. A bottle of wine alone. All kinds of feelings arise. People say that wine can relieve sorrow. I don't understand how sorrow can persuade wine. Whistling and singing in the middle of the night. Mostly dazed. Suddenly, unconsciously. Playing with the moon and forgetting tiredness. Leisurely flipping through old books. Get a small note. I looked at it in surprise. It was Chen Feigong's poetry collection from the past. Eight poems dedicated to Yushuang Pavilion. Yushuang Pavilion is the alias of the famous actor Cheng Yanqiu. Feigong entered Yanjing in the winter of Guihai. See my poems and paintings. I am very grateful for your appreciation. If I have any doubts, I will ask them. There is nothing that is not analyzed. At that time, my friend Luo Gong composed music for Yanqiu. I met Yanqiu in Wanhua's seat. I didn't know Yanqiu for long. Yanqiu is quiet and taciturn. There is a degree of behavior. At first glance. It doesn't seem to believe that he is good at singing and dancing. Only Feigong will praise it every time he mentions it. Later, I went to the theater with Feigong. Graceful Dragon Hong. Kengqiang pearls and jade. I began to believe that there were no false scholars under the name. Now Yanqiu is back in Shanghai. And Luo and Chen have both passed away. Alas. Yinggong is Yanqiu's confidant. Feigong can also be said to be Yanqiu's confidant. Husband to Feigong's talent is abundant. But it is stingy in meeting. Floating and sinking in the official sea for decades. Frustrated. Day lingers in the singing and dancing hall. Borrow poetry and wine to express yourself. Viewing his poems dedicated to Yushuang Pavilion. His sad and painful meaning. Overflowing with words. Is it the sad man of ancient times? Now Yanqiu is here. And his poems are accidentally discovered. Why is it so clever? Is it not the spirit of Feigong immortal? Therefore, I hastily wrote an autumn news. In order to introduce those who admire Yanqiu's name on the sea. You must not know Yanqiu's reality. Therefore, I briefly describe its outline. His poems say. The beauty of the generation is unparalleled in singing. I feel that the beautiful man is better than the charming woman. Not because of the distorted pen of the actor. Wang Xie's children are enough to have more. Jade bones are naturally outstanding under the frost. Romance has turned all the sages upside down. In order to pour out the tears of the earth and the sky. A chivalrous and beautiful young man. (Some people said to Yushuang that Feigong was quite moved by his official feelings. Yushuang smiled and said that Feigong had not been an official for thirteen years. But he likes Zen Buddhism. This trip may be specially for Buddhist affairs. Alas. Yushuang can be said to be a confidant.) The bag is decorated with small family seals. It is common for Qingmen to be commoners. Wind flowers are easy to feel the pain of rise and fall. The crows disturb the ridges and the setting sun. Why does Ningbi play the flute? Singing makes people pity. This child is uniquely talented in Jiangshan. Fengyi should also lead future sages. (After Yinggong's death, he was too poor to hold a funeral. Yushuang cried painfully and took the responsibility.) Slightly send gratitude and hatred to the wine side. The gentle singing and delicate dance actually communicate Zen. Turning the lamp over and back to the tears of peach blossoms. The heavenly demon outside the flower has already realized the mystery of Yushuang performing the Legend of Hongfu. Many martial artists watched. A venerable person wipes his tears alone.) Retreating from the seat is a waste of wisdom. The remaining plums are withered and the peonies are late. The frost is clear and the Qin moon is empty. Only see the golden flowers and a jade branch. The handsome Zhou Lang on the sea has sorrow. (Speaking of Meiquan) Zheng Ge praises you as a strange genius. Shanyang heard the flute and thought of Luo Yin. (Speaking of Yinggong) I don't see the startling swan reflecting on the water. In the end, the autumn color of the Tao family is beautiful. Sparse fence is fragrant and clean Yixi flowers. Smiling and imitating the idle love Fu. Let Longtian eight parts be noisy.</p>
<h3>Double Tide at Bapu</h3>
<p>— Liu Henwo寄自杭 (Unable to Translate: Sent from Hangzhou)</p>
<p>Autumn tides are surging. Long famous in Zhejiang. However, the target of the audience. Most abandon this and flock to Haining. A feast for the eyes. Mostly sighing in admiration. I don't know that there is still Bapu. Double tides in the southeast. Even more spectacular. However, it is about twenty miles east of Haining. The location is still remote. Silent and unknown. China Travel Service Hangzhou Branch has taken note of this. This year, a special Bapu tide watching tour was organized. Because of this, thousands of spectators have returned. A colleague, Lou Weihong. Had previously explored. Surprised and told. I am eager to see it for myself. Three days after the Mid-Autumn Festival. Fang intends to ask Mu Jiejun to go with him but fails. And was abandoned because it was full. Fortunately, I consulted with the manager of the company, Mr. Li Jingru. Courteous seat. Beginning to join the car. There are more than 400 spectators. Fifty cars were dispatched. Connected one after another. Like a long snake. On the Hangzhou Haidao Road. The terrain along the way is relatively high. The scenery is vivid. Silver ponds and white sails. Frost maple red leaves. All in sight. Like an exhibition of paintings. Reached the destination at eleven o'clock. Walked on the seawall. Gazing around. The sun is shining. Scales reflected in the waves. Before the tide comes, people are already surging. Until 12:20. People are boiling. Stretching necks and concentrating. From afar, I saw the white awns in the southeast. Slowly rising. The lines meet like arcs. Silver waves rolling. From far to near. Its sound is like thousands of troops and horses. The south tide suddenly recedes. Turbulent currents compete. The east tide follows. Contact and struggle. Attack and agitation. Surging. Just like the momentum of a group of tigers pouncing on people. The tide hits the stone embankment. Struggling upwards. Then madly turned over. Soaring into the sky. Like a snow mountain pouring down. A silver cliff collapsed. About three feet high. The audience was chilled. They ran away from each other. If you lag behind a little. Clothes and shoes are all wet. I risked taking a photo. Only沾餘波 (Unable to Translate: only沾餘波). It's also lucky. Watching the great waves. Thousands of miles backflow. The interest is exhausted on the way home. Crowded and congested roads. The sound of the tide and the shadows of people. Fleeting. I will look forward to today next year again.</p>

<h3>Warmth in the Heart (295)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14 Cui Zhu's Tears Blotch, Yi Ren's Heartbreak, Hong Lian's Fragrance Fades, a Girl's Soul Leaves</p>
<p>From the servants gradually to the accountant in the family. From the accountant to the eldest young master and the second young master. Because that kind of thing. It is most useful for people to talk about. No matter what story. No matter what play. As long as there is a woman in it. Added a lot of interest. The master took a concubine outside. Borrowed a small mansion. What fragrant and shocking news is this. Therefore, the family members often use this as a topic. Count as a kind of discussion material. Only the female tiger was deceived alone. Because no one in the family is not afraid of her. If she knew about it. It will set off a great storm. Who will take this responsibility. Therefore, whenever they are squeaking and mumbling. Just when they were talking about this matter. Suddenly seeing the wife coming. Everyone quickly held their breath and remained silent. The wife couldn't help but be a little suspicious. Why is it that when I was discussing something. When I saw me coming. Just stopped. There must be something strange about this. Could it be that they are trying to hide it from me? Since she is called a female tiger. Naturally, she is very jealous. A very jealous person. Is also a very suspicious person. She suspected that they were always talking bad about her. But she has never detected what it is. But I also feel that the master's recent behavior is not right. One day. The wife went out to buy something in the afternoon. Told the master in advance. Said that after you go out. Send the carriage back. I want to buy something. The master naturally dared not disobey. When he arrived at his shop. He ordered Gensheng to send the carriage back. The wife is going to buy something. Gensheng arrived home. Especially pleasing. Walking to the wife's outer room. Seeing Ajin. Forgot himself. Then he said. The master told me to send the carriage back. Said the big wife is going out to buy things. These words came from Gensheng unintentionally. But the wife heard it in the room. He hurriedly came out and said. Gensheng. What did you say. Where is there a big wife going out to buy things. Gensheng said. No. I said the wife is going out to buy things. The wife said. You don't have to deny it. Clearly said big wife. Just call me big wife. What's the matter. But your horse's foot. Is revealed today. It turns out that this Master Yin. Lianxiang was taken outside. I want to see Lianxiang well. All the people Lianxiang uses herself. Do not call the concubine. All are called wife. Like the coachman Gensheng and the like. Are people who run on both sides of the big mansion and the small mansion. All are called wife. It seems that there is no difference. So he came up with his own ideas. The wife in the big mansion. Is called the big wife. The wife in the small mansion. Is called the second wife. Just call it like that. It is also easy to call it. But you can only call this kind of title behind your back. When you get to the front. But you can't add that kind of title according to your own thoughts. He called it smoothly. Unintentionally. Added a big word without big or small. Revealed that horse's foot.</p>

<h3>Gold Swap Date: Gold Market Superior</h3>
<p>▲ Most Have Been Swapped</p>
<p>▲ Bulls Adding at Over Nine Taels</p>
<p>▲ Market Volatile. The gold market on the 16th continued its upward trend, but with constant changes and unpredictable fluctuations. The exchange started swapping ahead of schedule, opening an hour early at 8 o'clock. Swap transactions had already begun outside the exchange, initially estimated at a little over seven taels to over nine taels. Subsequently, based on the listed price, nine taels and three mace were added by the bulls. Afterward, it surged to nine taels and seven or eight mace, mainly due to the bulls pushing the price higher, forcing the shorts to accept losses. The afternoon market weakened slightly, estimated at nine taels. It is rumored that Fuchang and others had not yet finished swapping, but a small portion of fellow traders had completed their swaps the day before yesterday. The Ningbo group had completely swapped their positions. The November contract totaled approximately forty thousand taels, with about 40% still remaining to be swapped. All November contracts, as usual, were halted, and transactions mainly shifted to December contracts, opening at 573.1 taels and closing at 568.4 taels, a decrease of 1.2 taels compared to the day before yesterday, based on the December listing price. Afternoon listing was canceled. As for December contracts, they had already entered the market, and transactions by various firms were not bad, but fluctuations were frequent, with a daily range of eight taels. Exchange rates remained stable, with banks absorbing and then releasing. Yuansheng, Yuanxing, Yongfu, Shunli, and others were taking in, while Hengxing, Taixing, Dadecheng, and others had sold out. Initially, the overseas silver market was low, and swapping had pushed the price higher, resulting in significant profits. Subsequently, it seemed to enter a consolidation phase. Furthermore, major players such as Zhifeng and Yongyu began to sell, causing a sharp drop of over six taels. Exchange rates also loosened. Later, Yuancheng, Xinxing, Jin'an, and others competed to buy, improving market sentiment significantly, leading to a rapid surge that far exceeded the morning market, reaching 565.8 taels, while exchange rates remained stable. Finally, it slightly declined by two taels, and traders felt uneasy, with large contracts potentially continuing to decline.</p>
<p>▲ Repeated Fluctuations. The initial opening price for December was 563.8 taels, similar to the raw market, with limited trading.

<p>▲ Resurgence and Stabilization. The afternoon market opened up 2.4 taels, at 61.8 taels, followed by 62.03 taels. It was rumored that Indian exchange rates were slightly lower at Anbang. Suddenly, Hengxing and Yu Da sold, correcting by two taels, to 60.3 taels at 2:15. Later, Yuancheng, Xinxing, Taixing, and others vigorously advanced, with Zhengjin absorbing December British gold at 7 5/8 pence. Sumitomo Huabi sold December US dollars at $39.5 to .3125, which was taken in by Hengxing, and the gold price gradually rose by more than five taels. At 3 o'clock, buying was particularly strong, and by 3:15, it had jumped to 65.8 taels, with extremely lively market sentiment and short sellers greatly stimulated. However, the prime rate was not very strong, and wheat firms and others sold. December was at 175, and January Korean Huabi traded at 175625. Korea also bought January US dollars at $39.5625, and the gold price fluctuated slightly by one tael from 3:20 to 3:50, with a range of seven or eight mace, reaching 63.5 taels at 4 o'clock, due to retail investors and exchange rate hedgers selling.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Market Shows Slight Improvement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver market fell again, while exchange rates rose. HSBC's listed prices showed no changes in any exchange rates. However, the domestic market seemed tight, but not overly impressive. It tended to be strong early on, but then loosened due to the decline in the gold market. The afternoon remained stable. Although the gold market rose, it was not affected because banks were still willing to sell. Almost as gold swapping and December contracts came into play, the exchange rate seemed to take a different turn. Comparing the results with the day before yesterday, British gold decreased slightly by .0625, US dollars decreased by .125, and Japanese gold increased by .0625. Chinese merchant gold firms initially sold and then bought back, with many transactions. About 200,000 pounds of British gold were traded, with Datong, HSBC, Youli, and Anda buying in the morning, and Huabi, Mitsui, Macgalli, Sumitomo, and others selling in the afternoon, with Hengxing and others buying back contracts. Various banks also traded tens of thousands of pounds among themselves. 200,000 US dollars were also traded, with Hengxing and others settling 200,000 dollars, while Yuntong, Huabi, and Sumitomo sold. However, Korea made slight advances. Japanese gold transactions remained weak, with only a few settlements, and Mitsui sold. Overall, the exchange rate market could still stabilize, or enter a consolidation phase.</p>
<h3>Overseas Silver Market Falls Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to London dispatches, large tael silver futures for both near and far terms fell by .125, totaling 16 5/8 pence (equivalent to 1 shilling and 7 3/4 pence for British gold). Chinese merchants sold off in limited quantities, with a calm market and speculative sellers emerging after closing, leading to a dull market. Additionally, according to New York dispatches, the US silver price also dropped by .125 to 3.6 dollars. British dollars increased by .0625 to $4.85875, while US dollars against British dollars increased by .09375 to $4.859375. Japanese dollars against US dollars increased by .0625 to $49.625. British dollars against Japanese dollars remained at $49.625. British Shanghai shillings shortened by .125 to 1 shilling and 7 3/4 pence. No dispatches from Bombay. Furthermore, Reuters at 10:30 AM and the Telegraph Agency at 9:20 AM, noon, and 2:30 PM repeatedly reported no changes.</p>
<h3>Decreasing Foreign Silver Cents</h3>
<p>▲ General Market Situation. Yesterday, the foreign silver cent market was particularly weak, and market prices decreased sequentially between morning and afternoon. Industry speculation suggests that, given the current weak trend, a turnaround is unlikely in the short term. Although there is demand for high-quality rice, transportation is dangerous due to poor market conditions, so most inland merchants are settling accounts with each other, naturally reducing the need for foreign silver. Additionally, the military operations have ended, and military demand has ceased, which should lead to a decline.</p>
<p>▲ Cent Exchange Rates. (Foreign Silver Cents) The morning market was at 7 mace 2 fen and 6 li, a decrease of .625 hao compared to the previous day's afternoon market. The afternoon market was even weaker, falling another .625 hao to 7 mace 2 fen 5 li 3 hao 7 hu 5 si. Given this situation, there is a clear downward trend. (Silver Exchange) Both the morning and afternoon markets opened at 5 fen, also a decrease of 1 fen compared to the previous day. The commission rate ranged from 2-3 fen to zero, similar to the previous day. Bank postings still had no market price.</p>
<p>▲ Subsidiary Currency Market. Jiangnan small silver dollars were at 6 mace 4 fen and 5 li in both the morning and afternoon markets, with 6,000 jiao traded in the morning and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon. Guangdong small silver dollars were at 6 mace 3 fen and 6 li in the morning and 6 mace 3 fen and 5.5 li in the afternoon, with 175,000 jiao traded in the morning and 70,000 jiao in the afternoon, and a customer source of 50,000-60,000 jiao. Copper coins suddenly increased by 3,500 wen, to 393,500 wen.</p>
<p>▲ Silver and Foreign Silver Inflow and Outflow. (Silver) Yesterday's bank settlement news: Chinese merchants settled over 2.4 million in bills, foreign merchants settled over 1.3 million in bills, various goods, exchange taxes, and payments settled 7.89 million, special payments settled over 2 million, outflow was 1 million. Japanese banks settled over 3.1 million in various payments, inflow was 300,000. Money shops and silver firms settled over 37.7 million in individual payments, commission rate payments settled over 4.3 million, various exchange payments settled over 700,000, and cash receipts were tens of thousands. (Foreign Silver) Exchange bill payments were 1.275 million in the morning and 945,000 in the afternoon. Banknotes were 10,000 in the morning and 45,000 in the afternoon. Off-market banknotes were 145,000 in the morning and 95,000 in the afternoon. Bank checks were over 300,000. Bank foreign silver trading was 600,000 in the morning and 400,000 in the afternoon. Interbank foreign silver transactions totaled over 1.8 million, with banknote inflows and outflows of 1.7-1.8 million. Money shops and foreign firms settled over 5.2 million in individual payments, foreign exchange commission rate payments settled over 1.5 million, foreign silver borrowing settlements totaled over 1.2 million. Small peers traded over 600,000 in banknotes, exchange rates, and new currency, and a customer source of over 300,000. 240,000 in Hangzhou new currency arrived, but the destination is unknown.</p>
<h3>Securities and Government Bonds Market Quiet and Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, only 14,000 yuan of government bonds were traded in the spot market throughout the day. The futures market was better in the morning, with over 4 million yuan traded in two sessions, but the afternoon market was extremely quiet, and sentiment was unusually calm, with only 1.5 million yuan traded, totaling 5.65 million. The 1919 Customs bonds accounted for the most, at 1.85 million. Demobilization bonds were only about 1.4 million, downsizing bonds were 900,000, and 1996 Customs bonds were over 500,000 each. Other bonds were extremely quiet. Bond prices were flat due to major players being hesitant, with the trend increasingly stable. The results showed more declines than increases compared to the previous day, mostly only around .2-.3 yuan. Without new changes in the overall situation, there should not be any major increases or decreases in the short term.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market Suddenly Tense</h3>
<p>The yarn market suddenly rose because manufacturers aggressively bought in. Retail investors, seeing the tense situation, also followed suit, making the market less liquid. Buyers seized the opportunity to push prices higher, causing a sudden increase. However, actual sales in the market were quite clear. Business for various groups was not smooth. The Chaozhou group remained calm, with no intention to buy in. In terms of global trends, optimism is unwarranted.</p>
<p>▲ Manufacturers Aggressively Buy Standard Yarn. The pre-market opening price in the public auction was higher due to manufacturers buying in the previous day, tightening market sentiment. Retail investors covered their positions, and sellers were scarce. Prices for all months rose by one, two, three, and four mace. The afternoon public auction yarn market remained firm, but actual sales were not high. Prices for all months rose by one and two mace. The total daily turnover was 25,650 bales. Xinhua sold 1,800 bales, Tianlong 1,800 bales, Jifeng 750 bales, Tianchang 900 bales, and the remaining 4-600 bales. Tiancheng bought 1,800 bales, Yiyu 1,750 bales, Hengyi 1,350 bales, Dachangcheng 1,250 bales, Gongtai 900 bales, Yuda 800 bales, and the remaining 3-400 bales. The closing prices for the public auction are recorded below.</p>
<p>| Public Auction Price | Change | Inventory | Public Auction Price | Change | Inventory |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| October 1516 | Up 17 | 23,900 | January 1502 | Up 15 | 56,400 |</p>
<p>| November 1505 | Up 18 | 38,700 | February 1505 | Up 12 | 29,100 |</p>
<p>| December 1502 | Up 16 | 41,250 | March 1510 | Up 14 | 101,50 |</p>
<p>▲ Spot Sales Slightly Improve. Spot yarn sales were better. Total purchases by various groups throughout the day were 1,195 bales. Fellow traders bought 60 bales, Guangdong customers bought 200 bales, Shantou bought 95 bales, Xiamen bought 65 bales, mainland China bought 155 bales, Hankou bought 300 bales, Yunnan bought 270 bales, and miscellaneous groups bought 100 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Shows Little Improvement</h3>
<p>The cotton market was calm, and the trend remained weak. The global cotton market was not good, and factories were full of Indian and American cotton. Transactions of Chinese cotton were cut off. According to Hankou news, cotton prices fell by more than one yuan. The combined price of standard goods coming to Shanghai was about 30 taels. A portion of the Hankou group sold futures short, but the inland groups continued to buy in. Japanese firms continued to short, but Dongmian Foreign Firm sometimes bought and sometimes sold, making it difficult to predict.</p>
<p>▲ Hankou Public Auction Recovers Half a Fen. The Hankou public auction opened in the morning with calm market sentiment. The yarn price rose, bringing up the cotton market, and prices rose by one and two fen. The afternoon opening was still tight, but due to a lack of spot sales, sentiment loosened again, and prices fell by five fen. Total daily turnover was 47,100 dan. Lichang sold 6,000 dan, Hengyi 2,300 dan, Daji 2,200 dan, Minghua 2,900 dan, Rongxing 1,500 dan, and the remaining 1,3-400 dan. Gengfeng bought 2,900 dan, Yuande 2,000 dan, and the remaining 1,2-300 dan. The closing prices are recorded below.</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Declines Sharply Again</h3>
<p>▲ Zhabei. Yesterday, there were over 40 sources from various groups. The market was depressed. The new japonica market fell again, with ordinary goods down by about half a yuan. The Zhenzhen brand special top-quality japonica was currently opening at 16.3 yuan, and the situation still required further decline. Thin rice arrived during peak sales, but then slowed, falling back by .3-.4 yuan. High-quality goods were at 14.5-14.6 yuan. Yangxian rice sales were not developing well, and river inventories were gradually increasing. Buying sentiment was subdued. Dujian rice arrived in succession. Zero-lot sales were slightly inquired about. Production news continued to be soft. The above prices all fell by .3-.4 yuan, and the market situation was extremely weak. The port price was cheaper than the bottom price, so shops were still full, but the situation was slightly soft. Guest-brand sharp rice fell slightly by .1 yuan, with few transactions, but sources seemed to be turning scarce. White yuan old goods sales were sluggish and poor, and new goods were encroaching, causing a drop of about .2 yuan. Sales of new variant yuan were active, but goods were scattered, and prices opened at 15 yuan and change. New yinyuan rice arrivals were booming, and prices recovered by a small .3-.4 yuan, with high-quality goods opening at 14.1 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai South. Yesterday, there were over 30 arrivals. Sales on this street were inconsistent. The new japonica recovery wind was gradually intensifying. The top goods of the regular group opened at the 16 yuan mark, down about .3 yuan on average. Due to the encroachment of Japanese rice, sentiment in the Suzhou-Tong group was extremely soft. Japanese rice arriving and landing in Shanghai was similar in quality to Tongli rice but sold at a price of around 10 yuan. As the foreign sales market was not active, prices continued to fall by .2-.3 yuan. The Nantong group's kiln-grown baige and other rice varieties arrived in succession. Purchases from all sides were sluggish, and prices followed the overall downward trend by .1-.2 yuan. Yangdujian rice sales were refreshing, and transactions were slightly more active, but sentiment had to weaken by about .1 yuan. High-quality factory-machine sharp rice opened at 10.7-.8 yuan, and the market situation was mediocre. Variant yuan rice was in short supply here, so it still hovered around 16 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Still in a Free Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, prices for all months consistently fell sharply. Although foreign wheat quotations showed a slight improvement of .2-.3 yuan, market sentiment remained extremely weak. As guest groups had no huge appetite this month, the factories' chips naturally followed the environment and increased. Moreover, a portion of the warehouse receipts from previous months had to be returned and handed over, but customers had not accepted them, making people feel even more exhausted. The longer-term situation was also one of repeated strong rejections and continuous releases by major factories. Rumors of a batch of Australian wheat having been confirmed (with external rumors also suggesting Russian wheat), led many non-industry bulls to sell, causing the market to continue to fall. As a result, the current month fell by .325 fen compared to the previous day, November and December fell by .3 fen, and January, February, and March fell by .275 fen.</p>
<h3>Distant-Month Wheat Declines Sharply Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the daytime wheat market showed a trend of near-month stability and distant-month declines for all months after opening in the morning and afternoon. The current month was relatively quiet due to a lack of arrivals, and most of the goods in the market were of low quality, which did not match the standard quality of the exchange. Therefore, bulls were still able to hold their ground. As spot prices for foreign wheat for the distant months were gradually becoming attractive, and due to the surplus, they were seeking to export, the inland bulls in each month had to reluctantly close their positions and were unwilling to hold on further. This led to a further sharp drop. As a result, the current month fell by a small .1 fen compared to the previous day, November fell by .9 fen, December fell by .6 fen, January fell by .7 fen, and February and March fell by .8 fen. The spot wheat market remained quiet, but there was very little high-quality wheat, and low-quality wheat also followed the standard and fell sharply. Yesterday, it was announced that 1,000 bags of Minguang and Guandian wheat were priced at 4 taels and 1 mace, and were handled by Fufeng.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Minghua Factory's Raw Sugar Has Arrived</h3>
<p>▲ Dumping of Goods: Dutch Red Sugar Opens at 3,000 Tons</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received a telegram from the producing areas stating that the current price of Cuban sugar was still 1.3125, the price of New York futures sugar for December was 1.35, up three points from the previous telegram, the price for March next year was 1.46, May was 1.53, and September was 1.67, each up four points. The current price of Java sugar was 8.125, a slight decrease of 0.0625 from the previous day. The futures price for November was 8.00, and December was 7.875, with no rise or fall. The Association's market quoted Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse grain white new goods at seven taels, nine qian, two fen and a half, with transactions still sparse. The price of medium grain white sugar in the market saw a decline, with No. 20 priced at seven taels, and the market situation was relatively flat. After the factory's opening of Japanese sugar, more than 40,000 bags of raw sugar from the Minghua factory have been transported in and will soon be refined and shipped. This is even more valuable in a time of sluggish sales, so the market atmosphere is calm and transactions are sparse. YRO mark is seven taels four qian and a half, YT mark is seven taels seven qian and a half, YP mark is eight taels, J mark is eight taels and five fen, all markets show weakness. The exchange board had Desheng Hao offering 150 bags of ice flower green at a price of seven taels six qian per yuan. In terms of dumping Dutch sugar, Huaxin Hao sold 3,000 tons of Dutch red sugar shipped in November, with No. 8 goods priced at 4.8 yuan in Dutch currency and No. 10 at 5 yuan, with new taxes added. The scale of the transaction is truly rare in recent times.</p>
<h3>Raw Silk and Tea: Inland Double Cocoon Shipments to Shanghai Are Not Weak</h3>
<p>▲ Factory Imports Unrelenting… Over 1,000 Dan Arrived Recently</p>
<p>This year, the spring, summer, and autumn silkworm cocoon harvests in various regions of Jiangsu and Zhejiang were poor, with poor quality and mostly double cocoons. However, Shanghai's double cocoon silk factories have strong demand from inland silk factories for double cocoon silk, so they are all working as usual. In order to reel silk for future orders, they cannot join the alliance of silk factories that have suspended operations. Double cocoon factory imports have not slackened, and various cocoon merchants have been taking the opportunity to ship double cocoons stored inland to Shanghai to meet market demand. In the most recent ten days, 480 packages of double cocoons from various regions of Hangzhou and Shaoxing have been transported in, and it is said that a total of 735 packages have also been transported from Wuxi, Changzhou, and Yixing.</p>
<h3>Precious Eyebrow Green Tea Transactions Turn Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the precious eyebrow green tea from Lulai Zhuang's sources saw a turnaround in trade, with the Russian merchant cooperative having already purchased hundreds of boxes of precious eyebrow tea from Sui'an. The Xiehe Foreign Firm has also followed suit with acquisitions, and other merchants have sent out many telegrams. At this point, the market for medium and low-grade precious eyebrow tea shows a glimmer of hope. For shrimp eye pearl tea, Jardine Matheson, Tianjin-Shanghai Trading Co., Doder and other firms have considerable appetite, but the selling price is still low. Although Russian merchants intend to handle Qining black tea, sales to England remain sluggish, and the market has no way to develop.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Han Merchants Search for Zhigong Woolen Cloth</h3>
<p>Piece goods trade has revived and become active again. Sichuan, Hankou, Changsha and other merchant groups are actively purchasing, especially the Hankou group which has the strongest demand. Transactions for Zhigong woolen cloth have reached more than 200 pieces, causing the prices offered by various brands to rise sharply by two and a half li. Sijunzi is sold for two qian eight fen and a half, Luh He (Deer and Crane) two qian nine fen, Shuangtonglu (Double Child Deer) two qian nine fen and a half, Changbanqiao Yipin Fugui (Long Plank Bridge First Rank Wealth) is completely out of stock. Fine Biji (serge) is popular again. Forty pieces arrived at Huxinting (Lake Heart Pavilion) yesterday and were completely bought up by the local merchants at a price of three qian. Seventy-five pieces of Sanyou Tu Yuan (Three Friends Bald Yuan) arrived and were sold out yesterday, also at a price of three qian. Twenty-five pieces of Gucheng Hui (Ancient City Meeting) arrived, offered at three qian three fen and a half, and were completely dispatched by colleagues. The stock of ball Luo Se (silk crepe) on the market is almost exhausted. Yuehua Rong (velvet) has risen by two and a half li.

<h3>Hardware: Galvanized Iron Sheets Prosper and Soar</h3>
<p>The trade in galvanized iron sheets has recently seen a boom like bamboo shoots after a rain. The addition of building merchant groups and the acquisition by Tianjin merchant groups have created a kind of tightness that is unmatched by other hardware products. As for the market price, it has prospered and soared due to insufficient supply. Currently, the market price for No. 22 is twelve taels two qian and a half per dan, No. 24 is eleven taels eight qian, No. 26 is thirteen taels two qian and a half, and No. 28 is fourteen taels two qian and a half, which is two or three qian higher than the previous day.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Executive Committee Sends Telegram of Congratulations to Zhang Xueliang on Assuming Office</h3>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department, having received a congratulatory telegram from Zhang Xueliang on assuming the position of Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, was greatly pleased. Yesterday, it sent a reply telegram to Zhang, expressing congratulations. The text reads: "National Emergency, Respectfully addressed to Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang of Shenyang. We have just received your auspicious telegram, respectfully noting that Comrade [Zhang] honorably assumed the position of Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force on the ninth of this month. The good news has reached far and wide, admired by all. We extend our heartfelt congratulations and admiration. Since the founding of the Republic of China nineteen years ago, turmoil has continued, and there have been no peaceful years. The people have been displaced, industry and commerce have declined, wounds are everywhere, and the country is on the verge of collapse. Therefore, all patriotic individuals share the same desire for order. At this moment, when warlords are beginning to fall and reactionaries have not yet been quelled, to complete the task of unification and peace, we must establish a foundation for long-term stability and security. Comrade [Zhang] is young and strong, publicly loyal and resolute. Having taken on the important responsibility of border defense, you are now assisting the highest military authority. Rescuing the nation from peril and leading the people to prosperity, establishing principles for the Party and the nation, and setting an example for all officials, we still rely on your grand plans to build the nation. We urge you to stay true to your original intentions and fully assist, in order to overcome difficulties and satisfy expectations. We hereby send this telegram in reply, respectfully conveying our congratulations and best wishes for your distinguished career. We hope for your understanding. The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department of the Chinese Kuomintang, Xian."</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Going to the Central Bank to Work as Usual</p>
<p>▲Rumors of Resignation are Not True</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Song Ziwen arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 7:00 AM on the overnight express train from Nanjing. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, he went to the Central Bank building to work as usual, and met with various bankers to discuss financial issues. Rumors of his resignation are not true. A reporter from this newspaper met with a certain banker yesterday and inquired about the issue of Song Ziwen's resignation. According to him, it was not mentioned at all during the meeting with Minister Song today (yesterday), which proves that it is not true. From the current situation, this rumor is premature, he said. Song took the overnight train to Nanjing last night.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Decides to Issue Navigation Industry Public Bonds</h3>
<p>▲The fund will be allocated from increased tariffs</p>
<p>▲Establishment of the Navigation Industry Bank is Expected after One Month</p>
<p>The Navigation Industry Association, in order to organize the Navigation Industry Bank and request the issuance of 10 million yuan in navigation industry public bonds to provide operating capital for the bank, convened a special general meeting, resolved to proceed, and decided that each shipping company would subscribe to shares according to the tonnage of their ships, with a deadline of this Monday. It is reported that the subscriptions have not yet been fully paid, but there are no problems with any of the companies. According to a letter from Cai Ziping, Director of the Navigation Affairs Department of the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Finance has decided to issue the public bonds, and the funds will be allocated from increased tariffs. The Ministry of Finance has already consulted with the Ministry of Communications, which has also agreed, and it has been decided that the two ministries will jointly submit a request to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Ministry of Finance is drafting the document, so the issuance of the public bonds is only awaiting approval and the completion of legislative procedures. The Navigation Industry Bank is expected to be established in one month. How the Ministry of Finance will allocate the public bonds to the Navigation Industry Association, and whether the bank will adopt a board system or a management system, has not yet been decided. The bank has already decided to be located at the original site of the Wing On Insurance Company on Guangdong Road, it is said.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Association Actively Opposes Directly Increasing Water Prices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "Respectfully, upon reading the newspaper, we learned that your esteemed association, before the completion of the audit of the Shanghai Waterworks Company and considering that it should increase prices, boldly issued water bills at the original price plus one-quarter, considering this a disregard for public opinion and legal principles, and returned the bills to the company. Our association is deeply impressed. Because the leaders of the financial association and the assembled merchants have raised their voices, even the stubborn and cowardly are standing up. All those responsible for paying water fees must have a burst of conscience, taking your esteemed association as an example, and proceeding together. Our association is grateful, and this is engraved in our hearts. We are writing to express our admiration, and hope that you will investigate. Sincerely, Shanghai Real Estate Association, October 16th."</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association also sent a letter to various real estate owners yesterday, stating, "Respectfully, regarding the water prices this time, the Shanghai Waterworks Company has arbitrarily increased prices by 25%. Our association is actively opposing this in accordance with the overall opinion. The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Shanghai Settlements, representing the interests of all residents, has lodged a serious protest with the Municipal Council, which approved the price increase. The Chinese Directors are also strongly contesting this. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and others have unanimously advocated that the company, knowing that public opinion is difficult to achieve, has automatically complied with the instructions of the Municipal Council and invited the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association and our association to send representatives to audit the accounts. The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association immediately wrote to the company stating that before the completion of the audit and considering that it should increase prices, all water prices should be charged at the original rate (i.e., 6%). Our association has already notified all parties in the case. However, the company is delaying the submission of the profit and loss statements and balance sheets for the first half of this year for investigation, as a delaying tactic. At the same time, it is calculating all water prices at the previously increased rate of 25%. Such a tyrannical approach is legally unacceptable and arouses public indignation. In addition to publishing a notice in the newspaper, we are issuing this special letter to request that you investigate. If your property is leased through a foreign firm and the water bill is also paid on your behalf, please immediately inform the foreign firm to pay the water bill as before, without adding any additional amount, otherwise it will not be recognized as satisfactory."</p>

<p>After 18,300 shi of Japanese rice, shipped from the Mitsui &amp; Co. to Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai and was stored in the Linghua Warehouse, Chinese rice merchants, attracted by its low price and high profits, flocked to place orders. This matter was brought to the attention of the Municipal Social Bureau, which, considering that it concerns the livelihood of farmers and the market price of rice, raised it at a bureau meeting for serious discussion. A method of prohibiting the purchase has been decided. The bureau has sternly warned all Chinese rice merchants not to purchase the above-mentioned Japanese rice, and will severely punish any violations. Starting yesterday, most rice merchants have been hesitant to proceed, so there was no news of any sales yesterday, it is said.</p>
<h3>Rice Milling Association Notifies Members to Refuse to Sell Japanese Rice</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Milling Association yesterday notified its members, stating, "Regarding the notification of matters, we have received Instruction No. 3068 from the Shanghai Social Bureau, which states, (Original text omitted). Therefore, upon investigation, Japanese merchants are shipping rice to China for sale, and the goods have already arrived in Shanghai. This Japanese rice is not supplied during times of domestic harvest failure, but is shipped after a year of domestic harvest. Their ambition to invade the Far Eastern market and harm our country's farmers' economy is obvious. In recent years, there has been a domestic shortage, and we have been forced to purchase foreign rice, with more than 100 million [currency unit omitted] flowing out, damaging the nation's vitality and bankrupting the national economy. Fortunately, there is a good autumn harvest this year in various regions, and we are waiting to recuperate and recover. We must not allow foreign invasions to disrupt the market and harm the people's livelihood. Based on the aforementioned instruction, we are hereby notifying all members to comply, refuse to sell Japanese rice, and not to mill or sell it, lest you be investigated. This is of utmost importance. This is a special notice."</p>

<h3>The First Sound of the Revival of Inland River Shipping</h3>
<p>In the past two years, the inland river shipping in this port has been in extreme decline, with frequent suspensions and closures of routes. Since the Zhejiang Construction Department's Shipping Administration Bureau took over the China Merchants Inland River Shipping Bureau in August, Director Chen Shuntong and others have actively reorganized it. In the past two months, those that had stopped have resumed operations, and new routes have been added. Externally, business has been expanded, and internally, the system has been updated. The long lifeless inland river shipping has suddenly shown signs of vitality. The new organization and its expansion are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Revised Name The Bureau was originally named the Shipping Administration Bureau when the Zhejiang Construction Department took over the Bureau. Later, the scope was deemed too narrow. The Shipping Administration Bureau decided to abolish the words "leasing" and change the name to the Management Office of the Inland River Shipping Bureau of the Zhejiang Shipping Administration Bureau. At the same time, a Business Office of the China Merchants Inland River Shipping Bureau was added. Both names have been submitted to the Zhejiang Provincial Government for filing. The bureau signs have also been changed.</p>
<p>▲Internal Organization The new bureau organization was determined by Director Chen Shuntong in conjunction with Sun Yunxiao, Director of the Shipping Administration Bureau. The general bureau has a general manager and manager, directly under which are the business division, accounting division, general affairs division, each branch bureau, each contracted route, and each ship. The business division has five sections: passenger tickets, loading, customs declaration, inspection, and wharf affairs. The general affairs division has four sections: documents, materials, navigation, and mechanical affairs. The accounting division has four sections: cashier, bookkeeping, review, and statistics. The new organization has been established since October.</p>
<p>▲Improvement in Business There are currently 22 routes, divided into four classes of bureaus. First-class bureaus have a turnover of over 20,000 yuan, second-class bureaus have a turnover of over 10,000 yuan, third-class bureaus have a turnover of over 4,000 yuan, and fourth-class bureaus have a turnover of 1,000 yuan. Those with an annual turnover of less than 1,000 yuan are collectively named agencies. The main routes of the bureau are Shanghai-Hangzhou, Shanghai-Huzhou, Zhongshan-Suzhou, and Linghu. When the bureau had not yet taken over, the freight charges for the Shanghai-Suzhou route were only 30 to 40 yuan per trip. Now, the average freight can be collected at 350 yuan per trip. In September, the Shanghai-Hangzhou route earned 1,559 yuan, the Shanghai-Huzhou route earned 2,250 yuan, the Shanghai-Suzhou route earned 2,199 yuan, and the Linghu route earned 1,086 yuan, an increase of five to six times compared to before.</p>
<p>▲Tangqi Silk Transport Tangqi, Zhejiang, transports silk to Shanghai every year, but there has never been a direct small boat. In the past, due to tax relations, direct silk ships to Tangqi will soon be operating. The Tangqi transport silk to Shanghai is now entirely contracted by the bureau.</p>
<p>▲Tax Declaration on Behalf of Customers The Suzhou-Shanghai route of the inland river ships relies entirely on freight. The most common goods shipped from Suzhou to Shanghai are tea and raw silk. In the past, each piece of green tea had to pay a tax of 1 tael and 2.5 mace, and raw silk paid more than 5 taels. Now, in order to develop local goods, the bureau has negotiated with the Suzhou Customs to reduce the tea tax to 6.25 mace and raw silk to 1 tael and 5. The bureau also handles other taxes on behalf of customers. Customers have reduced costs and simplified procedures, so they have flocked to the bureau to load goods. The business of the Shanghai-Suzhou route has become the first.</p>
<p>▲Opening of Yuhang Route The bureau plans to open six upstream routes in Zhejiang, and it has now been decided to open the Hangzhou-Yuhang route first. Director Chen Shuntong went to inspect the route in person and has now returned to Shanghai. He is discussing with Zhang Shusheng, Director of the Shanghai Bureau, and Sun Yunxiao, Director of the Shipping Administration Bureau, on adding ships, opening routes, and setting up branch bureaus.</p>
<h3>Special News on Sino-European Shipping</h3>
<p>▲First Sino-Australian Freight Transport The Australian Eastern Shipping Company created the first direct Sino-Australian route. The first ship, "Niree," has arrived in Shanghai, carrying 10,000 bags of Australian wheat. A large number of export goods were transported from Shanghai to Australia for the first time, carrying 1,700 boxes of Chinese tea, 3,000 bags of sesame, and more than 100 tons of miscellaneous goods. The freight revenue totaled more than 15,600 taels, which is a very good result. The second ship, "Saint Elphin," will arrive in Shanghai in early next month.</p>
<p>▲Phythian Transporting Chinese Goods The number of people purchasing Chinese goods in West Africa has gradually increased recently. In the past, because there were no ships going to West Africa from Shanghai, goods destined for West Africa were not loaded. Now, the European Freight Association has specifically discussed increasing new prices. Yesterday, it was decided that (1) Shanghai to Saint-Denis flour, 40 shillings per ton; (2) to Milela raw peanuts, 82 shillings per ton; (3) to Tae Kwon raw peanuts, 75 shillings and 6 pence; (4) to Sasse tea, 81 shillings per ton; (5) to Dakangspurg, 53 shillings and 6 pence per ton. All shipping companies have been notified yesterday to transfer goods to the relevant ports in Marseille, France.</p>
<p>▲Reduction in European Freight Rates Yesterday, the Pingzhun Foreign Company announced that among the goods shipped from Shanghai to Europe, (1) sesame seeds to the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands, originally 50 shillings per ton, have been reduced to 42 shillings; (2) cottonseed meal per ton has been reduced from 45 shillings to 41 shillings; (3) oysters per ton have fallen from 20 shillings to 18 shillings. European shipping companies have already implemented the reduction yesterday.</p>
<h3>Italian Shipping Company Resumes Far East Routes</h3>
<p>▲First Ship Exported from Shanghai Yesterday</p>

With the assistance of the Italian government, Italian shipping companies have recently restored their old state and started resuming routes from this month. Starting yesterday, the first ship has been declared for export, traveling to various ports in the Far East.

It is now heard that eight ships are scheduled to start operating in succession, four for passengers and four for cargo.</p>
<h3>Port Authority Builds City Ferry in Nanshi</h3>
<p>▲City Bank Allocates 60,000 Yuan for Construction</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Government Port Authority took over the wharves in southern Shanghai, it has signed lease contracts with Ning Shao, Sanbei, Daxing, and other shipping companies. On the one hand, it is planning to build new wharves and expand the riverfront construction. At the same time, it is preparing to establish a city ferry to facilitate the travel of people from Pudong to Shanghai. Yesterday, a meeting with the Director of the Land Bureau and others was specifically convened for this matter to carry out construction methods. The information learned is recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Restricting Foreign Merchants from Extending into the Riverfront The Pudong Laiyi Ferry and the section of the Bund at No. 16 have been surveyed by the Port Authority as the location for the construction of the city ferry. It has been found that the Jardine Matheson Wharf, a British merchant, extends into the river, not only hindering the operation of the ferry and the traffic on the water, but also affecting sovereignty. It has been decided to submit a request to the Municipal Government to order the Land Bureau to stop the foreign merchant. The wharves of Ning Shao and Sanbei near the area and on the Puxi side also extend into the river, obstructing the ferry. The Land Bureau will send personnel to survey the area and then reduce the size.</p>
<p>▲Discussing the Contract Price and Allocating Funds for Construction The construction of the city ferry, including landfilling, ditches, berths, and gravel, is estimated to cost 60,000 yuan. Director Xi of the Port Authority has negotiated with the City Bank to allocate the funds for construction, which has been approved by the Mayor.</p>
<h3>The Livelihood Problems of Ferry Operators and Ferry Households</h3>
<p>▲The Municipal Government Explains the Lan Ni Du Case</p>
<p>Li Qinghua and Lu Shanshan, representatives of the Lan Ni Du ferry households in Pudong, previously petitioned the Fifth District Party Department of this city because the Municipal Public Utility Bureau changed the ferry to a municipal ferry. The District Party Department received a reply from the Municipal Government stating that, "The Municipal Secretariat's letter No. 1469 stated, 'The Municipal Government's letter approved the Fifth District Party Department's report, stating that the Lan Ni Du will be changed to a ferry, and the ferry owners will lose their jobs. Please transfer the case to discuss appropriate measures,' and forwarded two attached reports to the government. After investigation, the case has been reported to the government by the ferry owners Lu Shanshan and Li Qinghua, and it was deemed inconsistent with the Administrative Appeal Law and was not accepted. According to the regulations on ferry matters in the city, the principle of municipal operation has been stated in the Rules for Commercial Operation of Ferries promulgated by this government on September 1, 1928. Subsequently, citizen Huang Zihe applied for the operation of the Dongjia Du and Lan Ni Du ferries. The ferry households of the two ferries firmly opposed it and expressed their willingness to have the government take over the municipal operation. It was approved in December 1928 to change the Dongjia Du and Lan Ni Du ferries to municipal operation for reorganization. Therefore, the municipal operation of the two ferry ports has been determined long ago, and this government has stated that when the municipal ferry is realized in the future, the original ferry will still be allowed to operate. If the business declines and cannot be maintained, the original ferry workers can be employed as much as possible to serve on the ferry to maintain their livelihoods. In this way, the ferry households have no fear of losing their jobs. Furthermore, the area of Lan Ni Du is very wide. The current location of the municipal Lan Ni Du ferry is between Dongmen Road on the west bank of the Huangpu River and Dongchang Ferry on the east bank. The ferry route operated by Lu Shanshan and others is between Jiangtian Wharf on the Puxi side and Yuanyi Wharf on the Pudong side, which is a very long distance. The routes are different and unrelated. Even if other ferry ports on the same route are established in the future, it is planned to leave enough space on the wharf for the original ferry to use, which is not in conflict with the original intentions of the ferry households. Now, the previous reasons are approved, and a letter is replied accordingly. Please investigate and handle the matter.' This is how it was approved. It is hereby recorded in the case and sent for your information."</p>
<h3>Chen Junyi, Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Citizens Training Association, Did Not Resign</h3>
<p>The Secretariat of the Municipal Party Department issued a correction, stating that the news report that Chen Junyi, a Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Party Department's Citizens Training Association, had resigned was not true.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Residents Oppose Datong University's Encirclement and Purchase of Civil Land</h3>
<p>The private Datong University in this port purchased more than 60 mu of land in the 28th Bao 4th Tu and 10th Bao 11th Tu areas of Zhongshan Road, Puzong District last year to build new school buildings. The atmosphere is magnificent and quite developed. However, recently, some unscrupulous people, under the guise of the university's name, colluded with local despots to forcibly encircle more than 200 mu of civil land, and privately established white contracts without following legal procedures, only giving 300 to 500 yuan of land price, in order to profit from it. The villagers were all angry but dared not speak out. Recently, Zhu and other villagers had their allocated firewood pond land forcibly purchased by the treacherous people. Unable to bear it any longer, they surrounded and requested the four Tudong to report to Municipal Commissioner Chen Yafu, and prepare a document to the Municipal Land Bureau to strictly investigate and deal with it according to law.</p>
<h3>Payment of Land Price for North Huilu Road Issued</h3>
<p>Director Wu of the Shanghai County Construction Bureau sent a letter to the district heads of the 3rd and 6th districts yesterday stating that, "Regarding the case of issuing the first phase of land price for North Huilu Road, the method has been previously discussed and agreed upon with your district heads. The application form for the issuance of land price has now been printed by the Finance Bureau separately. The total land price to be issued for the land used in the 3rd and 6th districts should be transferred by your office to the respective owners for collection according to the previously agreed method. Please prepare the seal and send personnel to the bureau to collect and transfer the payment in order to comply with the procedures.</p>
<h3>Customs Collects Escrow Tax on Exported Chinese Tea</h3>
<p>▲Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables to Request Exemption</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce urged the tea merchants to request exemption from the escrow tax on exported Chinese tea, and specifically cabled the Ministry of Finance stating, "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, according to the foreign firm tea industry association, the Ministry's order to pay escrow tax in advance for Chinese tea that is transshipped for foreign sales has not been approved. Now, the Shanghai Customs has implemented the collection, and a telegram from Hankou has been received stating that foreign merchants have transported a large batch of tea boxes to Shanghai, but they were unable to pay the escrow tax in advance, resulting in the suspension of transportation. Although the tea was ordered by foreign merchants, the payment has not been made and is still owned by the Chinese. As a result, the payment is delayed, and all the tea merchants in Shanghai and Hankou are shocked. The Ministry's order to pay the escrow tax in advance is for the purpose of preventing tax arrears. However, the association has repeatedly stated to the Ministry that it is responsible for ensuring that there will be no loss of national tax. It is requested to exempt the advance payment of taxes and immediately telegraph the General Taxation Department to transfer the order to the Shanghai, Hankou, and Xunyang Customs to stop the implementation, in order to relieve the tea merchants' stress. We earnestly await your instructions. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully bows."</p>
<h3>Eurasia Aviation to Start Operations Next Year</h3>

There is no need to hold a board of directors meeting at this time. The Eurasia Aviation Moscow line is still under negotiation because the Russian side has not fully agreed.</p>
<h3>Two Types of Company Names for Guild Member Representatives</h3>
<p>▲Consulting the Judicial Yuan for Interpretation</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Silk and Satin Trade Association yesterday stating, "Regarding the case of whether to restrict guild member representatives from having two types of company names, an application for interpretation was made. We have received Municipal Social Bureau Order No. 2602, which states, "Municipal Government Instruction No. 5868 stated that, 'The bureau reported that the Silk and Satin Industry Reorganization Committee inquired whether to restrict guild member representatives from having two types of company names, and requested to consult the Ministry for instructions.' The Ministry of Industry and Commerce replied, and the report was transferred to the Executive Yuan to consult the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. The bureau has been ordered to comply. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce replied, 'The Executive Yuan instructed that, "The report has been noted, and the situation has been transferred to the Judicial Yuan for investigation and interpretation before a reply is sent. Further instructions will be issued after the reply is received by the Yuan." You are hereby informed.' This order has been received, and it is hereby instructed that the matter be known and that further instructions be followed. This order is received, and it is hereby sent to your attention."</p>
<h3>Recent Disaster Situation in Henan Province</h3>
<p>▲Report from the Jisheng Society</p>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society recently received a telegram from Chairman Zhang Wei, acting Governor of Henan Province, stating, "The war in Henan Province is coming to an end, and the suffering of the people is truly unbearable. According to successive reports from investigators in the disaster area, whenever they arrive at a place, the villagers kneel down and weep, begging for urgent relief. The central government has promised to allocate 100,000, which is like a drop in the bucket. In total, the most severely affected areas currently include Shangqiu, Minquan, Ningling, Sui County, Kaifeng, Lanfeng, Luyi, Zhecheng, Qi County, Taikang, Tongxu, Fugou, Yanling, Weishi, Chenliu, Youchuan, Kaifeng, Linying, Xuchang, Xinxiang, and Zheng County, no fewer than twenty counties. The dead are buried hastily, the wounded moan everywhere, the huts are burned, and the food is exhausted. Alas, what is the hope for the people of Henan? We earnestly request your compassion and generosity, or raise large sums of money, or transport food, for continuous relief. We are extremely grateful and urgently await your orders." It goes without saying that the disaster area in Henan Province after the war is in a tragic state. The society has already transported three hundred thousand bottles of newly manufactured epidemic golden pills and Jisheng pills to various counties twice from Tianjin and Ping for initial relief. As funds for relief are currently strained and the roads are not yet directly accessible, it is impossible to do anything with a lack of both personnel and funds. The only thing to do is to sigh. However, Henan Province has been the area where the society has been providing relief for many years, and it is difficult to remain indifferent after this catastrophe. We hope that all philanthropists in the country will provide food and clothing to those in need, as there is no time to delay.</p>

This decree is to be known.</p>

The fees are also inexpensive. Recently, it was heard that new-style electrotherapy equipment such as X-ray machines and sunlamps have also been shipped from Germany and newly installed. The number of outpatients and inpatients has been endless in recent days, which is a great blessing for those with lung diseases at sea. It is learned that the hospital is currently urgently preparing for the second and third hospitals to meet the needs of the many patients. Once everything is established, a formal opening will be held.</p>

The Committee also issued a written reply to Zhou Zhanglin and other workers at the mill, stating: "We have received your petition. Upon investigation, the standards for labor union organization in this city are still being drafted. Your request is temporarily difficult to approve. You are hereby notified."</p>
<p>▲ Steamboat Woodworkers' Union - The seventh executive and supervisory meeting was held yesterday, with Ye Xianggao as chairman. After customary procedures, the chairman reported on the reasons for the previous adjourned meeting and the progress of work. A report was then given regarding Sun Zushun, the owner and foreman of Sun Shun Chang Factory in Chedaijiao, who suddenly shortchanged the wages that were already being processed on the 5th of this month, causing the factory workers to be unjustly exploited. Therefore, the workers spontaneously went on strike on the morning of the 6th. Wang Qin and others then reported the matter to the union. The union then petitioned the Social Bureau to send Comrade Wang Bing to negotiate with the factory owner. However, after several attempts, there were no significant results due to the great distance between the parties. Furthermore, according to the workers, it was decided that the factory should be responsible for compensating for the losses incurred during the strike. Ying Xiusheng and Chen Binwu were appointed to specifically handle the strike in Chedaijiao. The proposal for Standing Committee member Comrade Ye to resign was temporarily put on hold.</p>

<h3>Female Student from Wanzhu School Drowns in a Pool</h3>
<p>▲ Grade Six Study of Water</p>
<p>▲ Visit to the Waterworks Company</p>
<p>▲ Li Xiubao Accidentally Falls</p>
<p>▲ All Attempts to Rescue Fail</p>
<p>Li Xiubao, a sixth-grade student from the Wanzhu Primary School in the Nine Acres area, accidentally fell into a pool while visiting the Shanghai Inland Waterworks Company at Gaochang Temple the day before yesterday. Despite attempts to rescue her, she tragically drowned. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Study of Water - The Municipal Wanzhu Primary School has been established for nineteen years. Due to excellent management, the student body has flourished. Currently, the boys' and girls' schools have been merged, and the curriculum is taught equally to both genders. For older students in natural science, regardless of gender, teachers lead them on visits to various places to observe and corroborate what is written in textbooks. Last week, the sixth grade studied "Water Research," and the students expressed a desire to visit the waterworks. To ensure safety, two teachers visited the waterworks beforehand to examine the various water-related facilities. Finding many useful reference points, over thirty boys from the autumn sixth-grade class went by car on Monday, where the teacher provided practical explanations, benefiting the students greatly. Consequently, the girls from the autumn sixth-grade class also made the same request. On the day before yesterday, at approximately 2:00 PM, five teachers led the girls to visit the facility, following the previous method.</p>
<p>▲ Girl Falls into Water - Upon arriving at the Inland Waterworks, Mr. Dong, an employee of the waterworks, guided them to view the engine room, reservoir, and laboratory, which took about an hour. Finally, they visited the sand filtration pool. The pool was being filled with sand and had no water in it. The students were watching beside the pool when Li Xiubao noticed a high spot nearby that resembled a mound. Her curiosity piqued, she climbed up on her own. However, it was a water pool used for water filtration. Unaware of this, she was overjoyed upon seeing the water and clapped her hands, calling other students to come and see. Three or four girls heard her voice and followed her. In a split second, Li Xiubao had slipped and fallen into the pool.</p>
<p>▲ Tragically Drowned - Li Xiubao had climbed onto the No. 3 water pool, which was about six feet deep. After falling into the water, she could not swim and quickly sank to the bottom. The factory staff immediately ordered workers to enter the water to rescue her. Due to the depth of the pool, it took more than ten minutes to pull her out. She was barely alive and unconscious. Artificial respiration was administered, but it was ineffective. She was taken to Shanghai Hospital for various treatments, but nothing could be done to save her. She died in the hospital. The deceased was only fifteen years old, from Nanjing. She was usually well-behaved and diligent in her studies. Her classmates were extremely saddened by her death and plan to hold a memorial service soon.</p>
<h3>Large Fire on Mingguo Road Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>▲ One Man Burned to Death</p>
<p>▲ Nine Buildings Destroyed</p>
<p>At approximately 4:10 AM yesterday, a fire broke out suddenly across from the Siming Guild Hall at the Beisanjiao intersection on Mingguo Road in the Chinese district, resulting in the tragic death of one man. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Circumstances of the Fire - The area was filled with woodware and furniture shops, and all the shop employees were fast asleep. Suddenly, the patrol officer on duty there noticed thick smoke billowing from the upper floor of a building on Mingguo Road. Realizing there was a fire, he immediately pounded on the door. The shopkeepers woke up in alarm, only to find the fire already piercing through the roof. The officer quickly reported to the police station and telegraphed the fire departments.</p>
<p>▲ Intense Fire - At that time, the wind was very strong, and all the items were made of wood, making it easy to burn. As a result, the fire became extremely intense and spread to neighboring buildings on both sides. The sky was lit up by the flames, and the electrical wires along the road were also on fire. Firefighters from various branches arrived and put out the blaze. It took over an hour of intense firefighting before the fire was extinguished.</p>
<p>▲ Buildings Burned - One room on the upper floor of Shengchang Ironworks at No. 927 Mingguo Road, Wang Faji Furniture Store (a two-story building) at No. 929, Gongli Woodware Branch (one building) at No. 931, Juxinglong Gunny Sack Store (one building) at No. 933, two rooms on the upper floor of Wu Anji Pawnshop at No. 935 (the lower floor was also slightly affected), one building of Wang Qingji Used Woodwork at No. 1 Beisanjiao Street, and two large rooms on the upper floor of Gongli Woodware Main Store at No. 3 – a total of nine buildings were destroyed.</p>
<p>▲ Fatal Tragedy - At the time, most of the shop owners and employees lived in the shops with their families. When the police sirens sounded, they were startled awake from their dreams and rushed to escape, disoriented. Cries of alarm and shouting filled the air. Tragically, Cao Tianfu, a 22-year-old clerk from Donggou, Pudong, who worked at Gongli Woodware, was sleeping on the upper floor of the branch. When he woke up in alarm, he was surrounded by flames, and the staircase had already been burned through, leading to his death in the fire. It was not until 3:00 PM yesterday that his body was found in the burnt remains by his colleagues. His entire body was charred like charcoal, a horrific sight. The local bailiff then reported the incident to the local court for an examination.</p>
<p>▲ Investigating the Cause of the Fire - Qian, the head of the Second District, First Precinct, immediately led patrol officers and other officers to the scene upon hearing the alarm to maintain order. Yesterday morning, police officers were sent to investigate the cause of the fire. However, no one was aware of the cause, and each shop blamed the others. Neighbors also claimed they did not witness anything. The head officer then resent police officers to summon the alleged fire starter for questioning.</p>
<h3>Newlyweds Arrested</h3>
<p>▲ Cohabitation Due to Free Love</p>
<p>▲ Had Gone Through Marriage Procedures</p>
<p>▲ But the Woman's Father Resolutely Disapproved</p>
<p>▲ Both Have Been Sent to Court</p>
<p>Lan Lianchen, who works at the Holland Trading Company, lives at No. 1 Huajin Fang, Huajin Pailou, in the city. He has a daughter named Lan Xufang, who is in her early twenties and has beautiful features. She was studying at the Aiqun Girls' School on Penglai Road. Last year, her father betrothed her to Wen Sheng from Nanxun. However, Xufang had already fallen in love with her neighbor, Chen Mingqi, and they had secretly made a marriage agreement. Therefore, upon hearing that her father had promised her to Wen, she immediately expressed her opposition and requested to break off the engagement. Her father refused. On October 27th last year, Xufang left home and abandoned her studies, seeking help from the Women's Association. She lived in the Association for a long time, up to October of this year, but there was no resolution. Xufang then disregarded everything and placed an advertisement in the newspaper, stating that she had reached the age of marital autonomy and would choose her own husband for the sake of her own happiness, and her family could not control her. After the advertisement was published, Xufang met with Chen and rented No. 1 Daqing Fang, Ximen Road, in the French Concession. On October 9th, they held a free marriage ceremony, also with a banquet for guests and a marriage witness, but neither of their parents attended. After the marriage, they believed they would live happily ever after. Unexpectedly, Lan Lianchen found out. He asked people at the Women's Association, but Xufang had left on her own, so there was no solution. Lan then sent out detectives to locate them. At 7:00 AM yesterday, he reported to the French police, who sent detectives to arrest Chen and Xufang. Chen was wearing a handsome Western suit and had good looks. Xufang was dressed in a beautiful cheongsam and shoes. The two attractive figures were arrested together during their honeymoon. As this case falls under the jurisdiction of the Chinese authorities, they were immediately sent to the Second District Police Station for questioning. According to Lan Lianchen, his daughter left last October and stayed at the Women's Association, requesting to break off the engagement with Wen. However, he believed that Wen was better than Chen Mingqi in terms of talent and appearance. When he asked her why she wanted to break off the engagement, she could not give a reason, so he did not agree. She then ran away and claimed she could marry freely by simply publishing an advertisement. If that was the case, she could just publish another advertisement to divorce freely, without anyone else's consent. Her freedom was excessive. Chen had married last August. If he loved his daughter, why did he marry someone else? It was clearly a case of seduction and demanded punishment. Chen Mingqi stated that he was 20 years old, from Yuyao, and worked in the insurance business. His parents were both in his hometown. His love for Xufang began when he was sixteen. He first proposed marriage, but her father refused and betrothed her to Wen. This time, Xufang brought the newspaper to him, explaining that she had the ability to make her own decisions, so they married freely. As for his marriage to Ms. Xu (a student at the Minli Girls' School) at the age of sixteen, they had divorced last year by mutual agreement due to each having their own partners, and it was not seduction. Lan Xufang's statement was the same as before, and she expressed her determination to break ties with her father. The district planned to transfer the case to the local court for interrogation in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>French Concession Court Hears Case of Car Accident Killing Vietnamese Constable</h3>
<p>▲ Vietnamese Constable Died Tragically</p>
<p>▲ Two Drivers Have Their Reasons</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's car No. 1873, driven by Yu Xingui, collided with car No. 2377, driven by Sun Zulin, the driver of municipal councilor Sun Baorong, at the intersection of Rue Paul Beau and Avenue Sapey in the French Concession last month. The collision knocked down Vietnamese constable No. 398, who was on duty, causing injuries that led to his death. The police arrested both parties and sent them to the French Concession Court for questioning. The court ordered an on-site investigation and further review. The case was resumed yesterday. The lawyer representing the wife of the deceased Vietnamese constable No. 398 stated that the case was a tragic result of the defendants' failure to follow police instructions. The court's on-site investigation had made this clear. Vietnamese constable No. 398 died in the line of duty, which was regrettable. A car belonging to a certain Frenchman took him to the hospital, and the constable knew he was dying for his duty. He did not leave a will, but he had elderly parents in Tokyo, Japan, as well as a young widow and a four-year-old daughter in Shanghai. The whole family depended on the deceased for their livelihood. The constable was usually diligent and conscientious in his service at the police station. Now, in a second, he was killed by the negligence of the defendants. The defendants' negligence of duty and disregard for human life were unlawful in the extreme and should be punished with imprisonment for more than three years under Article 291, Clause 2 of the criminal law. For the private claim, a loss of 20,000 taels should be sought, to be borne jointly by the car owner and the driver. Sun Zulin, the defendant, was defended by lawyer Bahe, who said that the constable’s death was tragic, but it needed to be proven whose fault it was. Yu Xingui, driving car No. 1873, was the one who directly killed the constable. Sun Zulin, the speaker’s client, was driving car No. 2377 and crashed into the back of car No. 1873. Sun Zulin had only been fined once by the police station for not using his tail lights. Yu Xingui had been fined seven times since he started driving, and once he let someone who didn't know how to drive the car drive it and got caught by the police station, which shows that he was usually negligent in his duties. The constable asked my client's car to pass, but at the crossroads, Yu Xingui's car sped up, causing the tragedy. Yu Xingui should bear the responsibility. Yu Xingui was defended by lawyer Tibaik, who said that he shouldn’t be responsible according to the circumstances. He hadn’t committed any violations for seven or eight years. For example, even if a person has committed theft before, he can correct his mistakes and start anew. It is not right to assume that he must be at fault now because he committed a crime before. According to Article 13 of the Municipal Council’s regulations for cars, the car traveling from east to west should allow the cars traveling from east to west to pass first. Regardless, the north-south cars must wait for the east-west cars to pass before they can travel. The constable must have instructed the east-west cars to go first. Yu’s car had already passed the crossroads and was hit from the rear by Sun Zulin’s speeding car, causing Yu’s car to hit the constable. Sun Zulin is responsible for this. The Chinese and Western officials said they had heard the arguments from both sides. The Westerner was sent to ask both sides about the accident and report everything so it could be examined.</p>
<h3>Three Women Arrested for Extortion</h3>
<p>▲ Paper Package Taken from Behind Electric Pole</p>
<p>▲ Detectives Ambush and Apprehend</p>
<p>Zhou Shiliang (also known as Zhou Shangen), the owner of Zhou Caiji Construction Factory in Siwen Li, Datong Road, received a threatening letter from gangsters on the 26th of last month, demanding 10,000 dollars. The letter said that if he wanted to negotiate, he had to put red characters at the entrance of the alley as a mark. Zhou reported the letter to the Xinzha Police Station. The police chief ordered him to do as he was told. From that day until the 14th of this month, Zhou continued to receive five threatening letters, instructing him to wrap the money in newspaper and hang it behind the electric pole next to No. 131 in Siwen Li. Someone would come to take it. Zhou reported this to the police station. Chinese detective Zhang Jinlong, Chinese detective Bao Yanrong, Chinese detective Yang Peizhang, and Western detective Kainaidi, and others were sent to lie in wait. At one o'clock in the morning the day before yesterday, they saw Ningbo women Yao Achen, Shen Gushi, and Wang Huangshi emerge from No. 163, examine the electric pole, and then leave the alley. They soon returned to the house and emerged again. Yao Achen went to the electric pole and took the paper package. The other two women stood beside her. Chinese and Western detectives used flashlights to arrest the three women and take them and the paper package to the police station, where they were taken into custody. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court of the Special District Court. According to police lawyer Wang Yaotang, the investigation procedures were not yet complete, and a seven-day extension was requested. The threatening letter was presented as evidence. A report from the Chinese and Western detectives described the circumstances of the arrest. Zhou Shiliang, the plaintiff, stated that he had reported the threatening letter to the police and, following instructions, he had pasted red paper at the entrance of the alley. He had witnessed the defendant Yao Achen looking at the red paper at the entrance of the alley. When questioned, Yao Achen claimed that she lived in Caojiadu and had gone to Wang Huangshi's house in Siwen Li to collect membership fees. After a mahjong game, she went out to buy cigarettes and saw a paper package behind the electric pole, which she took. She was unaware of any threats or extortion. Shen Gushi also stated that after the mahjong game, she was hungry and went out to buy leek cakes and was arrested. Wang Huangshi claimed to run a catering business and knew nothing about the threatening letter. She requested a clear investigation. Judge Sun Yuan reviewed the statements and ordered the three defendants to be detained and questioned again in seven days after further investigation.</p>

<h3>Shanghai South Public Bus Line 3</h3>
<p>▲ Runs on Mingguo Road in the French Concession</p>
<p>Shanghai South Public Bus Line 3 originally ran from Laoximen to Bansongyuan. Later, due to poor business, it was changed to run on Zhonghua Road. To facilitate passengers, it was extended to run on Mingguo Road, making it a circular line. It began operating in mid-January of this year. The company also negotiated with the French Tramway and Electric Light Company, which also operates public buses in the French Concession, regarding the operation of the downtown section of the southbound bus on Mingguo Road, which belongs to the French Concession. An agreement was reached long ago, but the strike by the French company's employees caused it to be put on hold. Recently, a draft contract has been agreed upon and submitted to the Public Utilities Bureau for review by the municipal government. The Bureau has ordered the Shanghai South Company to sign the contract as soon as possible in preparation for opening the route.</p>
<h3>Girl Run Over and Killed by Car</h3>
<p>▲ Mother Witnessed the Tragedy</p>
<p>▲ Shouting for Help Nearby</p>
<p>At approximately 7:00 AM yesterday, a car with license plate number 1871 was speeding on Wenmiao Road in the city. The driver was careless and knocked down a three-year-old girl named Xu Abao who was walking on the road, crushing her skull. She died instantly. Her mother, Xu Li, witnessed the tragedy and shouted for help. The patrol officer arrested the driver, Zhu Wenbin, and the car and took them to the Second District, Second Precinct. The neighborhood chief of the Twentieth Ward, Jin Qiren, reported the incident to the local court for an examination. Prosecutor Wang and others examined the body and took it away for burial.</p>
<h3>Wusong Water Police District 4 Chief Patrols Offshore Waters</h3>
<p>Zhang Han, the chief of the Fourth District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police, ordered his subordinate detachments to earnestly suppress the rampant pirates who had been looting merchant ships and kidnapping people for ransom off the coast of Wusong. In addition, yesterday he took a naval ship to patrol Chongming, Qidong, Haimen, Nantong, Rugao, Changshu, and other county ports, as well as the waters off Sijiao, Shengshan, Huanglong, and Shishou Islands, to inspect the defense situation of the three major detachments 16, 17, and 18, and the defense conditions of each sub-detachment stationed there. He also checked and inspected the firearms, clothing, patrol boats, and other items to thoroughly reorganize them. The estimated trip will take about two weeks before he can return to Songjiang. All daily public affairs of the district headquarters have been entrusted to Wu Gengyang, the chief of the Second Section, to temporarily act as his agent. A report has been submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs for review.</p>
<h3>County's Second District Rectifies House Tax</h3>
<p>Shanghai County has been forced to reduce police funding and administration due to a lack of police funds, so it must also reorganize revenue. The county issued a notice to all districts to rectify the house tax to maintain police funding. It is reported that the towns in the Second District have received letters from the Third Sub-Bureau requesting the commune to notify the towns to jointly reorganize. This has now been completed one after another, with each town increasing the number of houses taxed by more than half of the original amount. Even Wujing Chegou and other places that had not been taxed before have been taxed appropriately to increase police funding and maintain security. Merchants and businesses are also deeply aware of the difficulty in funding the police and are generally willing to increase the tax.</p>
<h3>French Concession Court Punishes Stores Not Affixing Stamps</h3>
<p>Stamp tax in the Shanghai Concession has been implemented for a long time in the Public Concession. Most people consistently affix stamps, but sometimes stores fail to do so. Once discovered, Directors Huang Jiyan and Guan Jiongzhi would send a letter to the police station at any time to prosecute and fine the stores. As a result, progress has been rapid, and tax revenues have been steadily increasing. On the French Concession side, Directors Huang and Guan sent Liu Chunpu and Shen Rulin as stamp tax commissioners to the French Concession, which began operating on April 1. Liu and Shen actively promoted and initially adopted a peaceful approach, sending letters to the French General Police Station to warn and inform stores that had been found to be concealing stamps. This has been going on for several months. Recently, four stores, namely Cheng Maoxing Coal Store on Xujiahui Road, Qian Guang Sauce Garden in Baxianqiao, Dingshengxin Foil Shop on Lumei Road, and Yanchang Coal Shop on Julai Road, have been found to have failed to affix stamps more than once. Therefore, the Shanghai Stamp Tax Office submitted a letter to the French General Police Station, following the precedent set by the Public Concession, summoning the employees of the four stores Chen Erchang, Huang Fusheng, Chen Guoxian, and Chen Zhihong to the French Concession Court for prosecution yesterday. Commissioner Liu Chunpu personally testified in court. Judge Zhu Hui ruled that the stores had violated Article 5 of the Stamp Tax Regulations and fined Chen Erchang and two others ten dollars each. Chen Guoxian of the Dingshengxin Foil Shop was fined fifteen dollars due to the more serious nature of the violation. He warned that stricter penalties would be imposed in the future if any further violations were found.</p>
<h3>Rescuing a Helmsman Who Fell Overboard</h3>
<p>▲ Anchors Aweigh to Set Sail</p>
<p>▲ Suddenly Spotting a Person Clinging to the Anchor Chain</p>
<p>The Ningbo small fishing boat "Wanxing," loaded with salted crabs from Yong, arrived in Shanghai to sell its wares. It docked at Wusong in front of the fourth team of the Public Security Bureau's water patrol on the Pujiang riverfront. While waiting for customs clearance and inspection, a small boat from the Zhanghuabang Customs mooring station arrived. A foreign officer stated that the crab boat was parked in the shipping lane and ordered it to move elsewhere immediately. The crab boat's helmsman, Jiang A'ang, upon hearing this, was startled and hastily tried to raise the anchor and move the boat. In his haste, he accidentally lost his footing and fell into the river, disappearing instantly. Fellow crew members, alerted by the commotion, tried to rescue him, but to no avail. They presumed he had become one with the water.</p>
<p>More than an hour later, another crab boat, about a mile away, was raising its anchor to set sail. As they were pulling up the anchor, they suddenly saw a person clinging to the anchor chain. The anchor pullers were astonished. Just then, Lu Guanfu and Li A'er, who were rowing a sampan, spotted the person and immediately rushed over to rescue him. Upon closer inspection, it was the helmsman who had fallen into the water. He had been in the water for a long time, causing his body to become ice-cold, his face pale, and he was barely breathing. Lu and Li did everything they could to help, using ginger soup to revive him. Eventually, he gradually regained consciousness and was saved. He was then sent back to his boat. His survival was entirely due to the timely departure of the other crab boat. Had they delayed for another half hour, it would have been difficult to save his life. It was indeed fortunate within misfortune.</p>
<h3>Complex Reasons Behind Man's Murder</h3>
<p>Yesterday's report mentioned the case of a man murdered with an axe on Yangjiazhai Road in Pudong. It is now known that the deceased was Wang Zicheng, only nineteen years old, from Shanyang. He lived at 19 Tongxing Street. He used to work in a cigarette factory but was currently unemployed. The reason for his death is complex. Yesterday, Xie A'long, the local official from the 24th district, reported the case to the local court. Prosecutor Wang and others arrived at the scene to investigate and confirmed that the death was due to injuries. The deceased's mother, Wang Ji, 42 years old, claimed that her son had been murdered and requested justice. The official ordered the body to be prepared for burial and ordered the arrest and investigation of the perpetrator.</p>
<h3>Pirates Resist the Pingyang Warship Outside Wusong Port</h3>
<p>Around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, seven large sailing ships, fully loaded with hundreds of pirates, were spotted on the waters off Yemaokou outside Wusong Port, attempting to intercept merchant ships passing by. Captain Gong Jinqin of the water police brigade happened to be patrolling the area on the Pingyang warship and encountered the pirate ships. He immediately ordered the ship to open fire and suppress them. Unexpectedly, the pirate ships were fully equipped with firearms and resisted arrest by returning fire. Gunfire erupted on the sea, and merchant ships took the opportunity to escape into the inner harbor to avoid being looted.</p>
<p>After about half an hour of fighting between the police and the pirates, the leader of the pirate ship ordered the other pirate ships to spread out and encircle the Pingyang warship. Seeing this, Captain Gong ordered the warship to fire more than ten cannons, hitting two pirate ships. The pirates could no longer withstand the attack and scattered, hoisting their sails and fleeing. More than ten pirates were hit by the cannons and fell onto the ships, their conditions unknown. There were no casualties on the Pingyang warship, but several holes were punched through the iron plates on the deck by the pirates' bullets.</p>
<h3>Attempting Suicide Over Nine Dollars, Thirty-Six Cents</h3>
<p>▲ Tang Quanqing is indeed pitiable</p>
<p>Around 9:00 AM yesterday, a man, estimated to be in his forties, suddenly jumped into the Pujiang River and attempted suicide at the Xianshi wharf on the 16th pier. His body floated on the surface of the water without sinking. Two Chinese constables from the 11th and 72nd water patrol stations spotted him and immediately managed to rescue him and bring him to the police station. After questioning, the chief constable learned that his name was Tang Quanqing, 45 years old, from Zhenhai, and currently worked as an employee at the Dingmaohe Wild Game Store on Zhilan Street in the French Concession. On the eighth of this month, he had a transaction with Shengda Fish Company for nine dollars and thirty-six cents. He had already paid the amount, but the fish company had come to collect the money again in the past two days. Because of this, the store owner suspected him of embezzlement. He felt he had no face to show anyone, so he attempted suicide. The chief constable verified his statement and sent detective Ge Changsheng to summon the manager of the wild game store, Pan A'rong, to the station. Tang was released on bail.</p>
<h3>The He Residence's Car Accidentally Enters the Chinese Territory</h3>
<p>▲ Permission was granted on the spot to retrieve it</p>
<p>He Yaozu, a military advisor to the National Government residing at 4 Huanlong Road in the French Concession, owns a Buick sedan with license plate number 6602. Around 6:15 PM last night, He's eldest daughter and a relative surnamed Liu were returning to their residence by car. While passing near Nanyang Bridge, they mistakenly entered the Chinese territory. Because the car did not have a Chinese territory license, it was stopped by the patrol police there. Both the car and the driver were taken to the Second District Headquarters. He's daughter and the relative surnamed Liu first took a rickshaw back to their residence. Soon after, Director Yuan of the Public Security Bureau heard about the incident and immediately called the Second District Headquarters to inquire. Considering that there was only one police booth separating the area from the French Concession, the situation was understandable. He then ordered the driver, Liu Xiaodi, to retrieve the car with He's business card.</p>
<h3>Old Boat Carrying Oil Broken by Waves</h3>
<p>Hengtai Oil Workshop in Yangshupu recently purchased 140 barrels of soybean oil from Shen Hongji Oil Cart Workshop in Wujiang. It hired the Ye Minxing boat to transport the oil to Shanghai. The day before yesterday, the Ye boat sailed to the Liuhuo River area in South Huangpu. The wind was very strong and the waves were crashing. The Ye boat was old, and the hull was damaged by the shaking. Ye did not realize this and continued to sail quickly. Suddenly, a wave crashed onto the deck, causing the bow of the boat to break off by about two feet. Ye saw this and immediately lowered the sails and stopped. He then turned the rudder to steer towards the shore. However, the wind was still strong, and he was unable to lower the sails in time. As a result, the boat sailed straight towards the shore and crashed into the rocks. The bottom of the boat was smashed, and the tide rushed in. Ye and one of his crew members were knocked into the water. The crew members were unable to rescue them. Most of the oil barrels were shattered, and oil spilled all over the river. The boat was stranded on the shore. Yesterday, Hengtai learned of the incident and hired a boat to go there. Only about twenty barrels of oil on the Ye boat were undamaged. The rest were just empty barrels. The losses were significant. However, neither Hengtai nor Hongji was willing to take responsibility, and it was said that the Ye boat could not be repaired.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Frightened by Robbers</h3>
<p>Ma Jincai, a sixteen-year-old apprentice at the Xiemao Fruit Store on the 16th pier in the French Concession, was instructed by the store owner to collect more than three hundred silver dollars in payment on Biande Road at 9:30 PM last night. Unfortunately, the sight of the silver dollars attracted the attention of robbers. He had only walked a few steps out the door when three or four people blocked his path, brandishing guns and threatening him. They robbed him of the silver dollars in his possession and fled. Because Ma was so young, he was terrified by the robbery and became speechless and like a wooden chicken. After several minutes, he hired a rickshaw to return to the store. The store owner interrogated him, but he was already mentally confused and spoke incoherently. He was immediately sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, Ma was likely to have suffered severe trauma, which would cause changes in his nervous system.</p>
<h3>Reaction to Selling a Daughter-in-Law</h3>
<p>Xu Haihe, a carpenter residing in Sun Genglang, South of the Hongqiao Town in Western Shanghai, used to run a workshop in the Xujiahui Town West Street. He has a daughter named Suzhen, currently twenty-three years old, with exceptional beauty. In the winter of the 13th year of the Republic of China, she married Zhang A'nan, a farmer in the vicinity, through a matchmaker. After the marriage, the couple's relationship was still harmonious. However, there have been no children in the six years since. The aunt, Gong, is extraordinarily fierce, and the neighborhood is filled with the title of "Tiger." Recently, there has been constant scolding in the family, and Gong has been aiding the evildoers, even beating and starving her, causing Suzhen to be covered in scars and skinny. She encountered a bad husband. Her happiness in life is completely lost.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the husband's uncle (that is, Gong's younger brother) Gong Zongfa secretly instigated his sister Zhang Gong and nephew Zhang A'nan to secretly destroy the nephew's wife Zhang Xu (that is, Suzhen), saying she did not obey women's morals and should sell her to another family to get a virtuous and capable wife to assist. Zhang Gong, who was old and confused, was lured and agreed to sell her daughter-in-law Xu to someone else as a wife. On the morning of the 3rd of this month, at about 5 AM, Gong deceived her daughter-in-law Suzhen, claiming she was going to Fangjiaqiao on Hongqiao Road to buy cotton. When she arrived, Zongfa had already parked a car waiting there. He put Suzhen in the car and drove east quickly. It has been more than ten days. Afterwards, there was a lot of discussion outside, and it reached Haihe's ears. He went to the Zhang family to inquire about his daughter, but A'nan instead mocked his father-in-law, saying that Suzhen had run away with someone else and that he should find her for him. Haihe knew that his daughter had been sold, and the matter was confirmed. He inquired in many ways, and until the day before, he finally learned that his daughter Suzhen had been sold to a certain family in Chen's house in the southern end of the Jing'an Temple Road garden as a wife. He then went to the local Public Security Bureau and requested the strict arrest of Zhang Gong and Zhang A'nan, as well as the ant matchmaker Gong Zongfa, and requested a trial. He also hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint with the court.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Interior Approves Labor Hospital for Record</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Labor Hospital on Xiaoshadu Road in Shanghai has been operating for nearly a year. The total number of cured patients is no less than 10,000. The management is conscientious, and the results are remarkable, which has won the trust of the general public and workers in Shanghai. Now, in addition to striving for perfection in various internal settings, the hospital has also completed registration with various legal entities in Shanghai in order to show seriousness. It is said that the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau and the Social Bureau have already approved the record. Yesterday, the hospital received a document from the Municipal Social Bureau forwarded to the National Government's Ministry of Interior Min Zi No. 1355, approving the record.</p>
<h3>The Wonderful Use of Hengji Family Movie Projector</h3>
<p>▲ Let's Give it a Try in the Domestic Goods Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation yesterday sent a letter to the factories participating in the Nanyang Islands inspection team, saying, "Dear Sirs, We recently received a letter from Hengji Photographic Film Material Store, saying that after reading the newspaper, we learned that your association has an organization of the Nanyang Islands inspection team for the purpose of seeking the development of industry and studying the export of national goods. On the one hand, it can promote national goods, and on the other hand, it can investigate the commercial situation in Nanyang. It is a win-win situation, and we admire your careful planning. However, it is very inconvenient to carry samples when going there, especially those with larger areas. Although it can be replaced with photographs, photographs are dull. For example, a machine, its structure, its assembly, and the speed of its machine starting and working, etc., if they are replaced with photographs one by one, it will lack cohesion and be lifeless. It will be difficult for readers to understand. Now our store has a family movie projector that can shoot small films of forty feet long at a time. The shooting procedure is simple, and the projector is cleverly designed and convenient to carry. Moreover, this small movie film only sells for eight yuan and two corners for every forty feet. If it is shot into four hundred feet, it can be shown for about twenty minutes. The audience will not feel bored or lonely, and the entire factory and work situation will be deeply imprinted in the reader's mind. Compared with photography, the effect is very different. Therefore, I think that even if there are samples that can be brought for display, the entire factory and the work situation should also be filmed and brought for screening. It will definitely be welcomed by overseas Chinese in the country, and it will definitely have a huge effect on the development of national goods. Our store is thinking about the decline of our country's industry and admires the good organization of the Nanyang inspection team. We are very willing to do our best and do our best to protect national goods. Therefore, if Shanghai's Chinese merchant factories need to make small movie films, they can make an appointment with our store, and our store will send someone to make them for them. Only the price of the film will be charged (eight yuan and two corners for every forty feet). All procedures such as shooting, developing, and washing are free of charge. You can continue to work as usual when shooting, without any interference. After a few hours, you can finish the work. In addition, the members of the inspection team, who are going to Nanyang to inspect the industry, should also prepare a small movie projector and take it to various factories in the area to film, so that they can contribute to the national business community when they come back, learn from their strengths to make up for our shortcomings. The benefits are not small, and it is more detailed and vivid than ordinary written records. Fifteen copies of the instruction manual are attached, please consult the opinions of various factories to proceed as early as possible, etc. A corresponding letter is sent, and a copy of the instruction manual is attached. Please check it out. If you want to make a film, please contact the store in Xiangyuli, Catholic Church Street, French Concession as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>Further Acquisition of Accomplices</h3>
<p>▲ Gu Ziqing is not Gu Aqing</p>
<p>▲ The police station has no evidence to present</p>
<p>On the 11th of this month, Chief Inspector Xie Shuiquan of the General Patrol Room and others arrested six kidnappers from Pudong, Yang Hua, Qin Heshang, Hua Jinrui, Shen Laiyi, Hu Shaoqing from Suzhou, and Wang A'er from Shanghai, at 99 Shaoqing Lane, Lafayette Road, and Zhongxin Tea House, Haikou Road in the French Concession. They seized one box cannon pistol and thirty-nine bullets, which were handed over to the Special District Court for interrogation and detention. As reported in this newspaper, the night before last, the captured Wang A'er confessed that a Yong man named Gu Aqing was also an accomplice and had a major relationship with the attempted kidnapping of Jiang Baozhen in Chunzai Lane, Xinzha Road, and was currently hiding on Zhejiang Road. After obtaining the confession, detectives Ma Xiaozhi, Bao Tan Jinguanya, and West Inspector Mei Sheng went to the address at 2:45 AM yesterday morning and arrested Gu, bringing him to the police station. Immediately at 9:00 AM, he was sent to the Criminal First Division of the Special Court. The police station's lawyer Ru Baoyi requested an extension of the trial and to interrogate Gu together with Yang Hua and others. Detective Ma then reported the circumstances of the defendant's capture. Wang A'er was then brought to the case. Wang suddenly completely overturned the confession to the police station, only claiming to know Gu. He said that in July, he had opened room 414 in the Hong Kong Hotel for Gu, but he did not know about the kidnapping. When questioned, Gu confessed that his name was Gu Ziqing, not Gu Aqing. He did not know Wang, and he hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to argue that the defendant was a respectable businessman, a shareholder of Jiudahai Seafood Company, a shareholder of Fucheng Silk Factory, the manager of Daming Glasses Company, and had shares of 20,000 yuan in Shenzhou Hotel. He also pointed out that the police station's evidence was insufficient. Upon hearing this, the police station's lawyer Ru Baoyi said that the police station had only arrested Gu at 2:45 AM this morning and sent him to the court at 8:30 AM. The time of detention at the police station was only a few hours. Even if there was sufficient evidence, it would not be possible to present it. Moreover, the police station had repeatedly arrested kidnappers in the past, all of whom were businessmen, but the results all proved their guilt and were punished. Therefore, he asked the defendant's lawyer to understand the difficulty of the police station's work and not to focus on this. Judge Xu Jiashi verified the confession and then ordered the case to be postponed and tried together. The defendant was sent back to prison, and the police station's lawyer Ru was instructed that if he found that Wang A'er's confession was inaccurate during the postponement, he should withdraw the complaint from the court at any time. Lawyer Ru agreed.</p>

<p>▲ Business is handled by Shanghai</p>

Yesterday, it sent letters to various silver and money industries for reference.</p>
<h3>Intercepting Suspicious Pedestrians</h3>
<p>▲ Firearms were found on his body</p>
<p>Sun Shaokun, a Chinese detective from the Harbin Police Station, and two Chinese constables, No. 1421 and No. 1766, were inspecting pedestrians in the Wuzhou Road area around 8:00 PM the night before last when they found a certain person suspicious. They stopped him and Sun found a loaded pistol and six bullets on the man's waist. He was taken to the police station, where he identified himself as Shi A'lun from Wuxi. The chief constable ordered him to be detained and sent to the Special District Court yesterday morning. The police station's lawyer Li Zhishan stated the case, presented the gun and bullets to the court, and questioned the defendant. He confessed that he used to serve as a water policeman in the 12th team of the 3rd District of Kunshan Longwang Temple. He took leave to come to Shanghai and stayed at the Xu family's house in Zhujiaqiao, Zhabei. The pistol was given to me by a friend surnamed Zhang last night when he asked me to have dinner at the Fuxing Garden Hotel on Oujia Road. Later, he put the gun in my bag and asked me to wait near the bridge on that road to be arrested. The rest of his confession was vague. Judge Ge ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and the case to be investigated and interrogated again at a later date.</p>

<h3>Chen Sanbao Died of Addiction</h3>
<p>Chen Sanbao, a native of Ningbo, around thirty-seven or eight years old, used to work as a porter at the pier in Pudong. Several years ago, he became addicted to opium, resulting in extreme poverty. He sold his son for money, which greatly angered his wife, who separated from him. Afterwards, Chen still did not think about improving, and his opium addiction was not eliminated. In recent years, he had no money to buy and smoke opium, and his addiction became unbearable. Therefore, he bought red pills at a low price to relieve his addiction (that is, nicotine pills that are loaded on the gun, which are extremely poisonous and are a weapon for killing people). As a result, his face became thinner and thinner every day, and his appearance was ghostly. He begged for food on the ship for three meals a day, and slept in the teahouse at night, barely surviving. The day before yesterday, Chen was penniless and suddenly asked his long-separated wife for money but was refused. At 8:00 PM, he planned to go to the ship to beg for food, but he had no money to buy red pills for a day. When he walked to the side of Yihe Lane, Lanmudong, his addiction broke out and he collapsed and died. No one claimed the body. Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau of the Third District ordered the local security officer Xie A'long to report to the local court for an autopsy. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Wang arrived to conduct an inspection and ordered the body to be collected and inspected in a coffin in the hall.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Upon reading your esteemed newspaper's local news section, there was a report on the resolution of the coal-carrying dispute yesterday. While the facts are generally correct, there is a slight error regarding the price. The foremen and others subcontracted with Mr. Liu Yunzhang for 38 cents per ton, not 33 cents as reported yesterday. This is likely a misunderstanding from hearsay. As the price is a crucial matter, we fear it may cause unnecessary complications. Therefore, we specially request you publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section to clarify the truth. We respectfully request the esteemed chief editor of the Shen Bao to take note. Respectfully, Foremen Sun Lishan and Wu Shouyin.</p>
<p>To the esteemed editor of the Shen Bao, greetings. Today's local news section in your newspaper published an item titled "Hong Kong Bank News Update." However, there is no Hong Kong Bank in this city; only our bank, named the Hong Kong National Bank Shanghai Branch. As a result, many customers have been inquiring after seeing your report. We wish to inform you that our Hong Kong head office and all branches in various cities are operating as usual. We hereby request that your newspaper correct the news item to avoid confusion among the public. This is of utmost importance. With best wishes, Hong Kong National Bank Shanghai Branch, October 16th.</p>

<h3>Vanguard Monthly</h3>
<p>— Gao Wei</p>
<p>Inaugural Issue</p>
<p>Edited by Vanguard Monthly Society, Published by Modern Bookstore</p>
<p>Our eagerly awaited "Vanguard Monthly" has finally been published on Double Ten Day. This is yet another fresh force in the nationalistic literary movement.</p>
<p>Since the nationalistic literary movement was launched on June 1st of this year, the first nationalistic literary publication was the "Vanguard Weekly." It has been in circulation for almost two or three months. To expand and deepen the strength of this movement, and to pursue further in-depth exploration, they have added this "Vanguard Monthly." Therefore, the birth of this "Vanguard Monthly" can also be said to be a promotion of the potential strength of nationalistic literature, gradually building a solid foundation for nationalistic literature.</p>
<p>The writings in this inaugural issue of "Vanguard Monthly" can generally be categorized into two types: theory and fiction. Here, I would like to select some of the main ones for a brief introduction.</p>
<p>First, regarding theory:</p>
<p>General theories of nationalistic literature have already been scattered throughout the "Vanguard Weekly" and recently compiled into "On Nationalistic Literature." The articles here mostly pertain to elaborating on this aspect.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the reason why "Vanguard Monthly" is published on October 10th is also of profound significance. Hua Xing's "Understanding Our October 10th" explains this to us. The historical value of October 10th is the anniversary of the liberation of all Chinese people. Therefore, our excitement and enthusiastic celebration of National Day demonstrate that the Chinese people have shown recognition of the national movement and the joy of being liberated from thousands of years of autocratic rule. However, even after October 10th of the first year of the Republic, feudal forces remained rampant, creating a situation of warlord rule and hindering the progress of the national movement. We can understand that the nationalistic movement and feudal systems of thought are irreconcilable enemies. What nationalism demands is precisely the opposite of feudal systems of thought. Therefore, the demands of nationalism were completely undermined by feudal systems of thought. Thus, the great significance and value of October 10th were destroyed by feudal systems of thought. Secondly, the mentality and habits of the Chinese people still contain a strong feudal color due to thousands of years of autocratic rule. Therefore, familism still dominates all of China. Because familism is victorious, the people only care about maintaining the safety of their families and no longer concern themselves with all the issues of the nation's future. Therefore, since October 10th is a commemorative day that took a big step forward from familism to nationalism, the people surrounded by familism naturally cannot have a deep understanding of October 10th. "But we should know that this era is not the closed-door era of the past. The closed-door era was a competition between families within the country. This era is a competition between nations in the world... Therefore, in this era, familism is no longer sufficient as the center of our lives. We have to make nationalism the center of our lives. If we want to make nationalism the center of our lives, then we should have a particularly clear and respectful understanding of October 10th, the day when the nationalistic movement began to succeed. Every time we encounter this October 10th, we must examine our own strength, and we must use our strength to complete our great nationalistic movement." That is, every time we encounter October 10th, we must examine the impact of the potential strength created by our nationalistic literary movement, especially this "Vanguard Monthly," which was born on Double Ten Day.</p>
<p>The May Thirtieth Massacre was an unprecedented massacre of the Chinese nation by imperialists. All those with a little bit of spirit were as if intoxicated and fanatical about this unprecedented national movement of the Chinese nation, the first voice of nationalism expressed by the Chinese people. What was the impact of this united movement to resist imperialism on literature and art at that time? Li Meng's "The Impact of the May Thirtieth Massacre on Literature and Art and its Critique" discusses this issue. "Naturally, with such an unprecedented massacre as the May Thirtieth Massacre... our literary world must have been strongly affected. No matter how carefree our literary scholars are in their ivory towers, or how base and boring they are, the general literati of Shanghai, the literati living in the place where the massacre occurred, even if they did not witness the scene of the massacre that day, at least they saw how the people roared and how the emotions were surging. The stimulation and impact they received was, of course, even stronger. Therefore, they, like the students and workers, immediately burst out with angry feelings." The author also pointed out one by one the works published by those literati, and finally judged: "These are repeatedly expressed in the works, and are related to the central consciousness of literature and art. Some people consciously wanted to find a way out for Chinese literature and art. Some people opposed the affected, insignificant, and lyrical poems, and demanded heroic literature. Some people consciously advocated national literature. Unfortunately, these ways out that were found were not broad avenues, but narrow paths. As a result, China's chaotic literary world is still chaotic. This is really very regrettable. It is regrettable that our literary artists did not see the essence of May Thirtieth, nor did they explore the mission and history of literature and art. They created and advocated theories based on temporary emotions. As a result, they naturally gained nothing. The chaotic and sad literary world is still a chaotic and sad literary world, causing a good opportunity to promote nationalistic literature to fly away. Until now, we still have to start the nationalistic literary movement from scratch."</p>
<p>Ye Qiuyuan's "The Development of World National Art" summarizes the trends of modern world national literary and artistic thought. The author first analyzes in detail the main trends of modern art in various countries, such as Cubism and its subsequent Purism in France, Expressionism in Germany, Futurism in Italy, and Primitivism in Russia. In addition, countries such as Hungary, England, and Yugoslavia are also mentioned. Behind these trends, we all see the standing of entire nations. The author explains very thoroughly and clearly why modern art is national art.</p>
<p>Yang Minwei's "China's Architecture and Nationalism" is very noteworthy. Architecture is a form of external art. Therefore, the structure of buildings is indeed greatly related to the national spirit. If we want to study architectural history, we have to admit that the development of the national spirit is the progress of architecture. The progress and unique creation of architectural styles rely on the national spirit and ideology. Here, the author uses "Sasanian architecture" as an example to confirm this, and also explains the relationship between the buildings of various nations in the world and the national spirit. Then, the author discusses Chinese architecture and writes the second section, "A Bird's-Eye View of Chinese Architectural History," starting from the construction of nests by Youchao Shi. All the architecture of past dynasties has been collected. The third section then falls into "Nationalism and the Future of Chinese Architecture." The author expresses opposition to the current three schools of architecture: complete Europeanization, semi-Europeanization, and non-Europeanization. Instead, the author wants to take nationalism and the national spirit as the center and open up a way out for Chinese architecture. The author also has concrete stipulations for the materials, conditions, and principles of nationalistic architecture, which are worthy of our careful exploration.</p>
<p>Second, regarding fiction:</p>
<p>There are four stories in this issue: one is a translation, two are short stories, and one is a long story. Zheng Bo's "Xiuer" is said to be a long story of more than 100,000 words. This issue only contains the first and second sections, so let's wait until it is finished before discussing it.</p>
<p>Watsuji Tetsuro's "The Fall of Demosthenes" is written in a very fresh style and is unique. This is a story depicting political action, delivered in the form of a speech. The translator, Chen Baoyi, translates very clearly.</p>
<p>Xin Yin's "Wild Rose" is largely successful. This is a story about the peasants of Zhuji eliminating Sun Chuanfang's troops, with revolution as the warp and love as the weft. The excitement of the love triangle of the wild rose is used to complete their revolutionary victory. It is both a comedy and a tragedy.</p>
<p>Wild Rose is a Carmen-like woman. She does not like weak men. "...You yourself have no courage, you should know. You must know that the man A Mei loves is only a strong, bold, and brave man. This is her character, and no one can force her. In the past, she loved A Rong because he was a very strong, bold, and brave man. But now, this dream has been shattered by her, shattered cleanly." Perhaps this is the national character that we want to promote. We believe that love is absolutely conditional, and these conditions should be like those of A Mei.</p>
<p>Yi Kang's "Victorious Death" is about the deeds of his father, which makes us feel as if we are drinking stimulants. We not only know the situation of the Han and barbarian peoples in the Xikang area of ​​Tibet, but also know how the imperialists are instigating and inciting there, and their ambition to get involved in aggression. Secondly, we can also know how the soldiers and officials on the frontier are so immersed in ignorance and incompetence. His father was an excellent member, and as a small battalion commander, he sacrificed himself for the nation and won his victorious death.</p>
<p>The ideas of these two creations are both able to grasp the weapon of nationalism, and the descriptions are very powerful. It is truly commendable to have such powerful creations at this time.</p>
<p>In addition, Yi Kang's "The Expression of National Consciousness in Black Poetry" is also worth reading, especially for those who study national poetry. Regarding the texts of the national movement, there are Zheng Xinxun's "Recent Indian National Revolutionary Movement" and Ke Pengzhou's "The Past and Present of the Annamese National Independence Movement." Others include Man Ru's "Centennial Memorial of Manxland National Poet Thomas Brown" and Tiran's "The Recent World Literary Scene," all of which are full of content.</p>
<p>This issue also has a special feature, which is painting. That painting by Zhu Yingpeng, "Hou Yi Shooting the Sun," really adds a lot of color. In order to make us know it clearly, the editor attached an introduction at the front, saying,</p>
<p>The creation of new art, thought is the main point, and technique and style are secondary, because technique and style are only tools for expressing thought. The thought of Chinese painting has always been immersed in other-worldly concepts and has nothing to do with the nation. This must be reformed.</p>
<p>Chinese nationalistic painting is the art of life, which should focus on the expression of life, and should no longer work in the framework of landscapes, immortals, and Buddhas. On the one hand, we must take Chinese folk tales, stories, etc. as subjects, and these legends and stories must contain creative, upward, fighting, and enthusiastic spirits. On the other hand, we must draw materials from the history and figures of the national movement.</p>
<p>Hou Yi Shooting the Sun is a kind of ancient Chinese legend. Hou Yi is the bravest man, and his wife—Chang'e—is the most beautiful woman. These are our ancient male and female models, showing that the national character should be brave and enthusiastic. The story of shooting the sun is a symbol of the ancient human psychological desire to conquer nature. This fully shows the spirit of advancement, struggle, and spirit.</p>
<p>This painting really makes me love it and reluctant to let it go. I hope that there will be more powerful works like this published in the future, that is, working hard on nationalistic painting.</p>

<p>(15) Suna</p>
<p>Suna is my neighbor. I got to know her because I was learning Russian from her sister, Lizhe. Although I say I know her, I have never spoken twenty consecutive sentences with her. What can I do? I can't speak Russian, and she can't speak Chinese.</p>
<p>She is not very beautiful. Like other Russian girls, she has a very developed physique, so she can do many things that men do. She has elderly parents, very kind Russians. She has a very hard-working younger sister, and two older sisters. The second sister is Lizhe, who teaches me Russian. The eldest sister is a female dentist, but she has a seductive smile like a prostitute. She is the most metropolitan, so she is not often at home. The first time she saw me, she spoke to me in broken English.</p>
<p>"You are an Engiish man..." I responded with a contemptuous smile, because I didn't have the attire of an English gentleman.</p>
<p>"No. But are you a Gip y girl..."</p>
<p>Suna is purely a virgin from a northern European village. She has no decorations, her short light yellow hair hangs on her shield, her fair skin is without powder, her salt-colored eyes have a simple brilliance, and her whole body has statue-like solid flesh.</p>
<p>I often see from her passionate eyes that she wants to talk to me, but the lack of language restricts her.</p>
<p>Every night, Song and I go to her house to read Russian. When she sees us coming, she stops all her work and sits down with us.</p>
<p>Once, I couldn't answer her sister's question about my Russian practice, and she secretly told me in my ear.</p>
<p>When I first learned her name, I said to her,</p>
<p>"Your name is the same as my sister's," also called Suna, your sister."</p>
<p>"Yes, Suna, Shoora, isn't it almost the same?"</p>
<p>Then she laughed happily. At this time, I could barely say a few words in Russian.</p>
<p>One night, her sister went out. She showed me her collection of pictures. She can make exquisite patterns. On that picture clip, I saw that she had three older brothers, and now there is only one left. One of the two was killed by the Red Russians, and one was killed by the White Russians because he was a Red Party member. She took out a group photo of three young men for me to see. It was the first time I saw her sad.</p>
<p>Later, I stopped reading Russian for various reasons, so I didn't go to her house anymore. But she repeatedly asked Song,</p>
<p>"Why doesn't he, Su Ling, come?"</p>
<p>Then, I led the students on a trip to Jilin for three weeks. When I returned from Jilin, the weather had already warmed up, and there were more tourists in the park.</p>
<p>Several times at night, I met Suna walking slowly in the dark woods with a man.</p>
<h3>Fudan University's Wall Newspaper</h3>
<p>— He Zhi</p>
<p>Fudan's wall newspaper has recently become very popular, you could say paper is as valuable as in Luoyang. Whenever a new issue of the wall newspaper is published, students always crowd around like a sea of people, and there are also several Eastern Palace Princesses who are especially interested in finding out news, timidly squeezing into the crowd, looking shyly to see if there is any news about the Eastern Palace. They especially pay attention to Ah Fang's great works, because Ah Fang is the Eastern Palace's "private detective," who likes to write out all the secret history of the Eastern Palace. Therefore, when they see that Ah Fang has revealed the secret history of the Eastern Palace again, they must blush, lower their heads, mutter a few words, and run back to the Eastern Palace to report to the other princesses who are afraid to read the wall newspaper. From this, it can be seen that they attach twelve points of importance to Ah Fang. Recently, the princesses had a ridiculous proposal for Ah Fang, "Whoever puts this monkey in a cage (monkey is what Ah Fang calls himself) will be elected as the Palace Mistress" (a beautiful name for Empress). But in the end, no princess with such great strength was able to take on such an important position. The old monkey still continues to write the secret history of the Eastern Palace unrestrainedly. I am worried about the princesses. It would be better to write an essay for the male students, saying, "Whoever puts Ah Fang in a cage will be promoted to our emperor." Then, I think there will definitely be male students who are desperate to put this weak monkey in a cage, and the secret history of the Eastern Palace can come to an end.</p>
<p>The above is just talking about the wall newspaper's news about the Eastern Palace. Now, let's take a look at the types of wall newspapers at Fudan. Fudan's wall newspapers can be considered the most numerous compared to other schools. Recently, there are already seven kinds: "Xi Sheng," "Fan Chen," "Can Lan," "Shortwave Radio," "Purple Pigeon," "Xin Xian," and "Chen Zhong." Recently, Shizhong also published a "Long Tongue," which is said to have the mission of new youth, takes pure literature as its position, and aims to awaken the disciples and grandchildren of the general proletarian writers in Shizhong. However, not long after the inaugural issue was published, it was unfortunately torn off by those who were old and ashamed. This naturally aroused a sensational comment in the Fudan wall newspaper world. Some said, "This must have been torn off by the disciples and grandchildren of the proletarian writers." Some said, "The tricks commonly used by proletarian writers." Still others said, "The proletarian writers are really afraid that a third party will come to uncover their inside secrets, darkness, and dismantle their peep show." However, in this way, all the students of Fudan saw through the true face and methods of the dignified proletarian writers. However, the comrades who run "Long Tongue" hold the spirit of perseverance and continue to publish issue after issue, issue two, issue three... Now the third issue has been published. In the opening remarks, they issued such a fierce warning, roughly saying, "You can tear it down issue after issue, but we will write it issue after issue. In short, we have the mission of exposing the proletarian writers' peep show and all the dark secrets. This is the mission that our new youth should have." Indeed, from this point of view, the comrades who run "Long Tongue" have the main force to lead Shizhong. In this mixed literary world of China, they unhesitatingly exposed the black secrets of the proletarian writers and dismantled all the conspiracies, and at the same time pointed out the wrong path taken by the youth. Such a wall newspaper has a great power and significance for the youth world. On the other hand, they also discussed the future of the school, the funding, etc. "...There are 23,000 yuan in gold, deposited in a certain bank. Later, it was suddenly heard that the bank was about to close. Those who knew told X, but X only withdrew 15,000 yuan. How strange! There are still 8,000 yuan left, perhaps X thinks that the bank's closing is pitiful and intends to donate it." This kind of peculiar news really makes the readers confused. I think where the 8,000 yuan has gone will be known sooner or later. The above paragraph is about the news about Shizhong's "Long Tongue." Next, let's talk about the wall newspapers of the university.</p>
<p>Among the wall newspapers of the university, the most powerful ones are "Fan Chen" and "Xi Sheng." In this issue of "Fan Chen," there is a "Last Strategy of the Proletarian Disciples: Tearing" by Zhiyan Jun. According to the content, the comments after the tearing of Shizhong's "Long Tongue" are narrated. In addition, there is an article "Stepping Down" by Mu Jia Jun, which has considerable criticism of China's modern society, art, and politics. He said, "Of course, if Proletarianism always exists in China, China will not have a peaceful day." That's right, in today's society, who doesn't recognize Proletarianism as their only enemy, as harmful to China? The two words "stepping down" written by Mu Jia Jun are of course written after the "stepping down" of the proletarian writers.</p>
<p>"Xi Sheng" (using indigenous thoughts) faithfully writes out all the inside stories and personalities of the proletarian writers. There is an article by an enthusiastic person in the inside, the content roughly saying, "I really didn't know that he was really a red political conspiracy means, a sharp head for business, and a master of love." The facts are known to the world, and I don't need to repeat them. In short, the tricks of the proletarian are revealed page by page in Fudan's wall newspapers. If there is any peculiar news about the proletarian writers in the future, I will tell the readers. Finished.</p>
<h3>The Activity of the Student Organizations of Tongji University</h3>
<p>Youth is the golden age of life. The flame of youth burns in the life of youth, and boiling hot blood flows in the body of youth. The whole life is active and energetic. Moreover, youth is not willing to be trapped in a dull atmosphere and sink down. Therefore, youth has become the center of all organizational activities. Especially now, the youth organization is becoming more active. The wall newspapers and publications of various universities are becoming more and more numerous, and they are dazzling, making us feel like we are in a dark channel and unable to take it all in.</p>
<p>However, there are hundreds of students in our Tongji University, but the student organization is as rare as the morning star. There is only one "Xinbo Society." Therefore, the feelings between the students, due to the lack of contact, are extremely scattered and alienated. The atmosphere in the school is full of depression and dullness. However, the hot-blooded youth cannot bear to sink down like this, and in addition, they are constantly engaged in scientific research, and life is inevitably boring. Therefore, several students initiated a "Qing" society to seek contact with the students, academic discussion, and transformation of life. The society has been prepared, and is divided into five shares: publication share (wall newspaper), affairs share, document share, recreational share, and social share. Each share has one director, and the official establishment meeting will be held on Tuesday (22nd) next week, and five members of the preparatory committee will be elected to solicit members from each department to enrich its strength. It is heard that all the people who initiated and prepared are enthusiastic students, so the future of the society will definitely open a bright and splendid flower for the school. (Ming)</p>
<h3>Tongji Medical College General Membership Meeting</h3>
<p>At 10:00 a.m. the other day, the Tongji Medical College held a general membership meeting at the school. More than 200 people attended. First, Chairman Wang Jifu reported the reasons for the meeting, and Hu Shuhua, the president of the school, gave a speech. Then, Jiang Yisheng, Pang Jingzhou, and others spoke successively. Next, the proposals were discussed. The important proposals included submitting a request to the Ministry of Education to add a president of the Medical College and to increase funding. Finally, the executive committee was elected by vote. The elected members were Liu Pei, Luo Zehong, Wang Qi, and other 13 people. After tea and snacks, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
