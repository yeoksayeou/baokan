<h3>德波邊境戍兵衝突問題</h3>
<p>德波邊境戍兵衝突問題波蘭政府已接受德政府提議兩國合組委員會共同審查今日即開第一次會議此亦德波糾紛中一重大問題也</p>
<p>此問題之眞相現尙未悉惟據德人方面消息謂侵入德境之波兵携帶槍械顯抱侵略態度波方報告不符事實則其事之因爭疆界問題而起已可概見查波蘭因人種語言之複雜舊疆域本莫可稽考復國以後巴黎和會祇能將被占於德奥等國之波蘭土地規定一種辦法如波森省一部分西普魯士中一部分及丹齊等之區域則皆從德國方面劃歸波蘭者在波德疆界劃定時德國人頗表示不滿謂此和約犧牲幾百萬之德國人民而波蘭人則以爲尙有許多要求未能如願亦未認爲滿足因之德波之疆界問題雖經和會解决然其實則無法劃清此所以至今尙多糾紛也</p>
<p>波蘭人經過亡國極大之苦痛從前所受種種壓迫於人者今尙未忘力思所以自奮而不肯稍有所委曲德國亦深慮之故對於此次戍兵之衝突極爲重視認波蘭爲有意侵略而波人則以德國之軍事準進步甚速且時欲擺脫和約之束縛亦懼其野心復熾故對德亦有戒心形勢之緊張職是故耳此次邊境衝突委員會能得公平解决則爲波德兩國人民之幸否則相持不下意見愈深糾紛恐將由斯而益甚矣</p>

<p>男子足球錦標</p>
<p>中華足球不幸與日平手</p>
<p>結果三對三打成和局</p>
<p>上半時各一下半各二</p>
<p>裁判員旣不公又違章</p>
<p>中華力爭續賽日不允</p>
<h3>錦標保留至下屆解决</h3>
<p>本報二十九日東電中日足球决賽中日各得三球戰成和局上半時一對一下半時二對二當時偏面不公之裁判以致中華選手豪興頽唐全塲觀衆趣味减色華僑嘖嘖不平之聲溢揚空中中之不勝日之不敗此其故矣</p>
<h3>錦標保留</h3>
<p>中日是球賽畢成一和局時日方隊員登時退塲我方隊員十一人皆竚立塲中以待延長比賽時間時則諸人　集評詆裁判員之不公歷二十分鐘許忽接消息謂不再比賽請諸君歸寓休息記者即問有關係各方面奔走探詢旋悉雙方職員將開緊急會議討論此事嗣走訪我方足球敎練李瀚淦據稱按照足球規則爲雙方平手則應延長戰時以决勝負今日時間尙早大可續戰乃日員竟宣布罷戰實出我人意料我方總敎練馬約翰即向日本裁判委員會提出抗議晚間七時左右雙方在青年會舉行會議我方代表聲明願繼續比賽並詆責裁判員之違章中華足球隊王開攝</p>
<p>請釋明其理由但與會者關於規則之解釋意見不一激辯兩小時許日方代表堅持其强硬態度嗣通過决議案聲明無續賽之必要足球錦標保留至下屆運動會再定吾人對此固不能同意但事勢如此亦無可奈何也</p>
<h3>華僑助威</h3>
<p>中日决戰之訉遍傳全市蒞塲觀衆不可數計華橋到者尤多蓋此係中華唯一穩得之錦標歷日垂頭喪氣此時可揚眉吐氣焉中華學生數百人組織啦啦隊白衫紅帽相映成趣手執小國旗臨風飄摇彩色特目九十分鐘内歡呼之聲時起時落狂熱之情逹於極點</p>
<h3>風平浪靜</h3>
<p>大戰令下中日兩軍開始衝突幾度往返無甚緊要三分鐘後日本先下强手野澤手島互傳進展深入脚地左翼春山猛力攻門射之過野日人圍攻之勢仍盛依然壓迫卒以周賢言身手矯健李天生八面威風未幾即風平浪靜</p>
<h3>過眼烟雲</h3>
<p>中華内部旣平靜無事前鋒五將遂一擁前進歷破關塞勢如破足閃眼敵門在望曹桂成心急如火遂失之燥急良好機會恍如過眼烟雲</p>
<h3>吹毛求疵</h3>
<p>我軍前鋒迅速非凡日人稍一不愼即被我軍衝破陣綫三番四次我軍正擬長驅直入痛飲黄龍乃裁判竹内吹毛求疵横加越位之罪暗解日人之圍不法舉動貽笑大方一次陳家球盤球前進日内衛後藤以不合法之行動阻礙之差在後藤而罰加諸陳氏此其一端也餘可推見矣</p>
<h3>城門失守</h3>
<p>二十五分鐘時形勢急轉直下日人五鋒如長蛇陣首尾齊進我軍内部一時措手不及顧此失彼前後防綫土崩再裂右翼春山挑送中央中鋒手島大刀闊斧攻入門内日人首開紀錄全塲呼聲大起</p>
<h3>敵人膽寒</h3>
<p>我軍攻多於守惟每被裁判加以横阻豪興頽唐徒呼奈何一次日人在被攻之後手島親領前鋒孤單深入周賢言獨擋一面突然趨前迎之幸而敝人膽寒射之不中</p>
<h3>宣稱無效</h3>
<p>三十分時葉北華代陳家球作戰一枝生力軍大有精彩我軍包圍敵門死攻不已葉累次猛力射擊先後咸被守門齋藤救出戴麟徑曾打入一球不料裁判謂其越位宣稱無效至時觀衆懊傷選手失色權在裁判無可奈何</p>
<h3>得意之舉</h3>
<p>惟是我軍聲勢之盛無以復加十分鐘後日人漸形不支左内孫錦順出其生平絕技穿過敵陣前後衛相顧失色神足提起應聲入網中日乃各獲一球日人又來一度攻打不利而退我軍據勢直入孫錦順將再施身手乃守門齋藤先孫而到及時挽救上半時一對一和局</p>
<h3>出死入生</h3>
<p>下半時起日人乘風破浪大舉入攻非野即斜良機屢失守門周賢言目光銳利手足輕便最後仆地救球一舉誠有出死入生之功</p>
<h3>一驚一喜</h3>
<p>此後互相捕擊各逞身手戴麟徑得左來之球射之未中繼又直攻敵門又被竹内所截十三分鐘時右翼高山挑中周仆地挽救不料手島篠島雙管齊下打入門内日人又以二對一點先二分鐘之内我軍大顯神通長驅直入敵人退避三舍防綫齊破陳光耀如飛而至守門措手不及陳遂造成二對二和局二分鐘左右一驚一喜極滄桑之慨矣</p>
<h3>吉人天相</h3>
<p>雙方猛烈之攻擊至堪驚人二軍各有累次深入之機會但步少準確之射擊往返數次都無成績一次黄端華犯規罰十二碼日人大喜過望抱有必獲觀念乃一球蹴出高越門後吉人天相斯之謂也</p>
<h3>大禍光臨</h3>
<p>日人强横氣燄一時無兩又得裁判無形之恊助益覺可畏顧一再攻打均爲我所擋而我軍回攻之勢亦令人驚駭然屢爲不公之裁判所阻進展不暢日人反攻之機會因此益多中華怱而大禍光臨失去第三球此球之失裁判員己含笛在口將吹笛宣稱越位乃突見日人攻入作爲未見我軍提出抗議置之不理</p>
<h3>保住光榮</h3>
<p>我軍居於種種不利環境之下依然顯我大無畏之民族精神奮　不已足跡所趨敵人披靡黄瑞華遠送一球戴麟經乘勢射入成二對三保住不敗之光榮</p>
<h3>餘勇可賈</h3>
<p>最後十五分鐘中華不絕攻擊日人惟力圖死守保住相等球數其時孫鍾順陳光耀戴麟經均身先士卒奮勇直前然多置之失當不勝惋惜最後曹桂成有絕妙之挑送仍無成效結果三對三和局</p>
<h3>不平則鳴</h3>
<p>今日足球比賽旣罷中華隊員莫不憤懑隊長孫錦語記者裁判員之不公有目共覩我方隊員今日作戰極力而時時受不公允之裁判以故艱困迥異尋常如第三球裁判員方將聲明越圍已含笛在口旋見彼方隊員擁入遂宣布有效我方守門初以爲敵人越圍故遂整暇而不防日人竟乘機踢入也又如雙方作戰時限旣届而勝負不分按照常例應延畏時間即不延長亦應通知我方乃竟任令我方留場久待此種行動實大背規則又中國委員會中負責任者之一曾語記者足球規則本由國際規定遠東運動會之足球規則雖微有不同但今日裁判員違章之行動實足留一笑柄足球委員會之决議亦使人難明其眞意所在又我方因病不能參加之隊員李惠堂語記者今日之失敗其主因在裁判員之不公次爲我前方戰將缺乏指導人才作敏捷之攻勢致陣法微亂失去莫大之機會數次</p>

<h3>大會中之鬥拳</h3>
<p>（瞿荆洲自東京寄）</p>
<p>日菲二國注重鬥拳競技</p>
<p>我華提倡不難稱雄東亞</p>
<p>鬥拳在西洋雖爲最流行的技藝之一而遠東運動會中却向無此一項目自本届大會起日本體育恊會已承認其爲公開競技且有正式列爲大會項目之消息是亦留心運動之士所宜注意者也先是日本曾向我國反菲律賓非正式的交涉擬將鬥拳列入大會項目中因未得到確定的答覆遂作罷論第九次世界運動會在荷蘭開會時日本曾派代表兩名參加因羽毛未豐毫無建白掩旗息鼓而歸今年第九次遠東大會適在東京舉行日本鬥拳之志士向日本體育恊會提議請以鬥拳爲公開競技當得該體育恊會之承認旋又向我國及菲力濱徵求同意我國以係臨時提議前無成案未置可否</p>
<p>菲力濱之於鬥拳有二十年之歷史其選手危勒氏曾一度奪得世界之錦標其他以拳術名家的爲數甚夥惟技術較高强者多流爲職業的鬥拳家其普通選手之實力反不十分雄厚但鬥拳之風氣因受美國之暄染較盛於我國及日本本屆亦曾派有選手五名隨着出席遠東大會之運動員來日與日本比賽且爲參加一九一二年在美國舉行的國際大會之準備</p>
<p>鬥拳在競賽上有一種特性即以選手之體重分等級是也（例如分百一十二磅以下百十八磅以下百二十六磅以下百三十五磅以下百四十七磅以下等五級）日本人種天然矮小其在他種運動上如籃球足球等每因體格短小而吃虧有說有出之苦衷獨幸鬥拳一項以體重相同者爲對手可以補救日人天然之缺陷故日人提倡甚力其中堅選手有村上徐五十嵐牟田加屋山本山崎海老澤等七人</p>
<p>我國對於拳術造詣極深所謂武當少林等派早已噲炙人口其性雖與西洋鬥拳不同而我國人之擅長拳術天才殊堪自信近來張之江褚民誼諸先生提倡國術不遺餘力若鑒於本届遠東大會之情勢對於鬥拳一道加以研究則將來當不難稱雄於東亞也</p>

<h3>大會瑣聞</h3>
<p>（良自東京寄）</p>
<p>肚裏明白會宿的日本青年館裏除了中菲日三國選手之外印度阿三哥們也同住在裏面照理語言不通有口難說可是看他們恰都毫不感覺困難有一次見幾個來玩的日本小朋友同幾個菲律濱人談天菲律濱人祗說一聲（華太細）（日語我之意）就提起手來東點西劃點點頭碰碰眼做了好一套小朋友們看他們做一邊說着也斯或諾諾得不對再也斯也斯錯了又改諾跟着也舉起小手來形容了一泡菲律濱人看了還要點頭笑笑眞是妙哉妙哉兩邊說些什麽旁觀者永遠不清祇有他們自己肚裏明白</p>
<p>開放門戶遠東運動會原來祗有中菲日三國的競爭今年阿三哥加了進去多了一個聽說從下回起凡是居住在東方的各國人都可以加入這樣一來選手們不但紅黄赤黑白各自的色彩很濃像上面這樣的通話法大家做起手勢來開一個遠東手勢大會恐怕倒很有意思的</p>
<p>談雲落帽自從全國大會產生了一個孫桂雲女士後無論誰都知道不談運動則已愤</p>
<p>一談就是孫桂雲甲說孫桂雲不知怎樣一個想起來總很不錯乙說孫桂雲不過是個孫桂雲何令人之景慕至此丙說孫桂雲是個運動家日本的女運動家不是你們都見了嗎還不是相彷彿丁說這樣的嗎等大會開幕了大家都跳起來說（孫桂雲眞有這樣的孫桂雲嗎原來那個就是孫桂雲怪不得有人說（身不願爲總司令但願一識孫桂雲了哈哈）說話之間不禁手之足之舞之蹈之起來旁邊有個朋友拿着望遠鏡正在看得起勁一忽兒帽子同腦袋脫離了關係唉奇怪不奇怪</p>
<p>失眠統計說起來林會前夜是很重要們不必說了其餘職員以及扯客們也應養精蓄銳以待明朝了那知實際恰相白愈想早睏着愈是睏不着肚裏打盤算眼睛白閉着眞眞是寢而不寐其意云何自己也莫明其妙所以這夜的臨失眠者時間長短不計大概算來至少有十萬八千</p>
<h3>花花絮絮</h3>
<p>（林澤蒼）</p>
<p>（東京通訉）遠東運動會已於本月二十四日正午開幕記者與俞秉祺等乘車偕往典禮嚴重詳情已記本報茲特將是日會塲中有趣新聞集看台前萬頭攢助</p>
<p>錦於下庶國人　可知其盛况之一般也</p>
<p>（一）鶴立鷄羣之張伯苓</p>
<p>主席裏上日本重要職員七八人均短小而具東洋國風吾國總代表張伯苓獨高出衆首爲人所注目雖印度代表亦屈居於下固有鶴立鷄羣之概</p>
<p>（二）中國女選手漂亮過人</p>
<p>全體環游會塲中以吾國女選手之服裝最爲漂亮精神煥發田徑女選手全體衣白綢衫黑短褲（極短將近股）全裸腿部與足部頭上更圍以白巾均（毛斷）（日人指剪髮）故異常動觀華橋尤鼓掌不絕</p>
<p>（三男女平等之中國宣誓）</p>
<p>日菲印三國執旗宣誓概由三四男子擔任獨中國首創男女平等由兩男執旗兩女護旗一人宣誓聲音響亮十分裏爽深具運動員仁俠氣概也</p>
<p>（四）中國後援隊之助威</p>
<p>留日學生特組（中國後援隊）備大小國旗多面分乘汽車蒞塲助威均戴紅藍兩色帽是日中國勝菲棒球未始非（中國後援隊）喊呐之功也</p>
<h3>九屆遠東運動會詳記（二）</h3>
<p>大會之糾紛（錢華）</p>
<p>印度選手團不願懸英國旗</p>

<p>其次爲關於大會會長岸清一博士開罪我國代理公使江洪杰問題初駐日中國公使館於二十二日接奉外交部長王正廷來電派江代理公使於開幕日出席大會代表外王讀祝詞江奉電後即日下午用電話向日體恊會接洽負責人均不在遂於翌晨（即二十三日）親至日本青年館找岸清一至青年館後岸適赴繪畫館乃由青年會幹事張永敬君偕往晤岸在繪畫館前雙方立談岸謂這種重大事你僅用電話商量今晨秩序單業已印就此事辦不到云云辭頗强硬無理江怒巷云到日外務省說去遂無結果而散是日下午江訪我國代表團主幹郝伯陽君謂岸某如此侮辱代表團應正式提出抗議限他們明晨（即二十四日止）八時半前要有正式答覆第一次道歉第二外王祝詞正式列入秩序單否則我們可以全體退度不出塲郝即與日體恊會主事交涉雙方奔走調停直至晚間十二時始告解决日體恊會道歉及將外王祝詞列入秩序單各項均承認風波始告平息此又一事也其餘關於本屆大會採用規則問題亦曾發生爭執初日體恊會以岸清一會長名義電我國體育恊進會允許仍採用遠東規則但我選手團到日後日本陸上競技聨盟會又提出改用萬國規則問題經張伯苓竭力反對且以岸電爲證日始無辭轉而遷怒於岸清一遂由日陸上競技會名義發宣言謂岸過於專斷本屆大會所得之紀錄將不爲萬國所承認云聞此事係日體恊内部之衝突云</p>

<h3>蕭伯納最近談話茉莉</h3>
<p>他的奇異性情的暴露</p>
<p>想做强盜</p>
<p>寫劇本要像培一朶花</p>
<p>英人厚德生Ｊ·Ｌ·Ｈndson有（與蕭伯納談話）一文爲譯如下</p>
<p>蕭伯納的天才與他的富有現世差不多全知道的可是他也曾經過長時間的辛勤經過九年的寫作才得到今日的成功我有一天去訪他他對我說（我有九年的完全失敗）是的據我想來在他那一方面或許還要覺着不止九年呢因爲在我們談話的中間他對我說他已經是七十六歲了然而從許多參考書上看起來他却祗有七十三歲</p>
<p>在五十年以前他寫了一本小說（没有成熟）（Immaturity）但是一直没有出版的機會今年他預備把它印行這是怎樣令人一椿驚訝的事情呀蕭伯納他本不是一位小說的專家他最得意的是戲劇但他爲什麽不寫新的戲本呢雖則他覺得他是應該寫一些的他現在所做的事情却是辦公室裏小厮Officeboy'swork的職務自己在那裏搜集所有的作品來出一本全集他說這些事情祗有我這一個小厮能夠做他人是不能夠來帮忙的</p>
<p>這一次的談話是我到聖羅林土（St.Lawrence在蕭伯納鄕居的時候）去因爲他並没有嫌惡我的表示所以我才絮叨叨地問的他說你爲什麽不掀鈴呌我起來呢）他說這句話的時候是很寫寫意意的坐在椅子裏那一副鋼邊的眼鏡架在鼻樑上顯出十分安適的樣子他穿的是一件棕色的短絨衣他那雪白的鬍閙比我想像中的要多得多了他說話時候所特有的愛爾蘭士腔並不像在電話裏那麽一樣</p>
<p>（我想你或許要說我是魯莽罷（能挿了一句（你大概有些魯莽））然而我是已經來了你要不和我見面那也是很容易的否則呢我就要細細地觀察你了）我這幾句話好像使他感覺興趣他的灰色的眼珠在那参差的眉毛下一閃一閃地轉來轉去</p>
<p>我問他的一生文學事業他說（我生平從來没有轉過方向我是一直向前的）</p>
<p>（當你在做小孩的時候你已經决意要做一個著作家嗎那時你可明白你要成功一個戲劇家）</p>
<p>（哎呀我全没有那種心思你不要信口胡說我當初曾經想做一個畫家一個强盜或者一個車上司機人我們寫文章是因我能夠做的事祗有這一種但在開始的九年我是差不多完全失敗的我寫了五篇小說没有一篇值得出版家一顧的那時候喬治梅列笛斯（GeorgeMeredith　1828　1909英國小說家及詩人齋巧替查甫門寳兒書局校訂書藉他就是許多拒絕我著作人當中的一個</p>
<p>（我已經忘記你曾經寫過小說的）（是呀没有那一個曉得我所做的事情實則從一八七九到一八八三這四年當中我寫的小說最多我一天寫個不停像特羅洛浦（Jrollope　1815　1832英國小說家）樣有些是全没有登載的後來也有幾篇送到社會主義的雜誌裏去因爲那主筆先生在缺稿的時候倒很需要的我又從寫小說的經騐上知道怎樣地去寫其他的文章）</p>
<p>（我的小說在美國已經被刦了有幾種全是在美國書版的但是（没有成熟）這一篇今年却要從原稿上直接付印和我現在正在預備的全集一同出版</p>
<p>然而我仍舊懷疑蕭伯納的性格是否已經轉變因爲他的事業已經顯然地改換了他和我談話的態度是多麽謙和多麽懇切多麽愉快絕對不像一般人心目中所想像的那麽一個激烈慷慨富於革命性的人</p>
<p>他後來談談談秷他的全集上去他說（如果把所有的材料全部搜集攏來這本書是怎樣的偉大他會像福耳特耳）Yoltaire法國戲劇家１６９４１７７８）的著作一般可以塡滿三個書架本來我以前的作品是并不一定要付印的無奈我所寫的人物都在二十年以後所以現在看起來竟好像當時寫的一般</p>
<p>我們談到戲劇我問他在没有動筆以前是否很細密地把全部結搆計畫出來他說他并没有（如果在動筆以前就謹愼地計畫那就好像去創造一把鋸曲綫的鋸子造的人雖則自己感覺興趣看的人祇覺得迷惑罷了當我開始寫（聖喬（Ｓt　Joan的時候他的格式我自己是不大清楚的又當我開始寫（醫生的兩難）（The　Doctor's　Diiemma）雖則是隨筆寫寫但我曉得應該說幾句關於胚胎的笑話在寫（蘋果車）（Ａpple　Cart)的時候我的起頭是起錯了我本想寫有兩個獻體的黨然而我祇能夠寫國王與内閣我曾經一度想把開塲一節兩個秘書的談話删去然而我仔細一想如果果眞删去了全戲的生命也就要没有了</p>
<p>（你一定要承認一齣戲本是要像花一般的滋生）他又繼續着說（你讓他自然的生長然後他才生長要這樣他的結搆然後才可以完全他的完全就是因爲這一朶花没有人去折弄呀</p>
<p>我說我聽見你有一天曾經去聽過有聲電影Drliss是一個有天才的人但是我要去看的主因是要查查他們技術上的進步是怎樣吧了但這裏有一個問題就是在舞台上已經滿意了但上了電影就要閙着一個奇異的笑話）</p>
<p>說到這裏他秃着頭跑到門外去指導那個汽車夫他想了一想又對我說（我可以拿一本印就的開車指南給你我打開一看約莫有三百五十多個字這本書把從倫敦到他家裏的路由開得詳詳細細像到那裏轉灣到那裏一直去就到蕭伯納的大門之類都有</p>
<p>我們他别了他站在門口對我揚手我回壴頭望着他祇見一個頎長的身影一個有顔色的柔軟的領帶在胸前飄拂那雙老厚的羊毛襪和那雙灰色的長靴還是站着</p>

<h3>文舅舅仍常</h3>
<p>柴霍甫五大名劇之一</p>
<p>辛酉劇轉於三十一日復演</p>
<p>本劇發生底</p>
<p>時期是俄國革命前十九世紀末葉底一個秩天</p>
<p>地點是俄國的某鄕僻的小村落裏本劇裏面底主角不是韋逸文（文舅舅）也不是素妮更不是趙醫生或海蘭牠是丨人烟稀少的僻壤的氛圍氣底憂鬱和沉悶</p>
<p>本劇底内容是無所謂情節不過零碎摭拾些事實來反映出這時代的精神吧了</p>
<p>所有的人物是</p>
<p>哀愁憤怒是文舅舅</p>
<p>爲非文化的俄國生活所苦惱底趙醫生</p>
<p>窮途潦倒的史敎授</p>
<p>含辛茹苦底優婉的素姑娘</p>
<p>受盡煎熬的蘭太太</p>
<p>文舅舅中之素妮</p>
<p>心善命乖的三不像</p>
<p>靜穆的老奶媽</p>
<p>手不釋卷底迂俗的韋老太</p>
<p>總而言之他們都是些在荒凉岑寂中輾轉掙扎着底負了傷的小鳥</p>
<p>某村底一個莊子裏面住着一夥人渾渾噩噩地過着雖然沉鬱却也平靜忽然那莊子底主人大學敎授從都市裏退休回來了於是打破了那沈靜那敎授心緒惡劣害着痛風症要大家都爲他忙着那敎授太太海蘭底顔色眩惑了許多男人這樣那莊子裏底生活彷彿都給攬翻了那敎授底前妻底兄弟韋逸文一向替他管理那莊子底現在覺悟了自己是被蹂躪了的省識了自己從前的愚蠢跟那敎授閙起來了因此再爲着種種的逼迫敎授和太太不得不離開這村子而他去了一塲風波平靜下來了這莊子裏又重歸於沉寂了本劇裏底事實不過如此</p>
<p>作者底眞理是借趙醫生和素妮底嘴文舅舅</p>
<p>裏說出來的他說（我勤苦做事這村子裏没有第二個人這樣勤苦的了若是一千年之後人類能有幸福那麽我也曾對於他們的幸福略效棉薄的了要等到我們的後代的子孫或許會代到一點幸福的門路吧他又說（人有天賦的理智和創造的權能使他可以去擴展那上帝留下底世界）他是這樣地努力着這樣地憧憬着素妮呢埋頭工作口無怨言當他的舅舅向她說（我是這樣地愁悶你會不會知道我是這樣地愁悶呀）底時候她答道（我們有什麽法子呢我們總得過我們的日子我們要過下去呢我們要過那一大串後來的迢迢的長日和漫漫的長夜我們要耐心忍受那命裏註定的刦難我們要趁現在就是將來我們老了底時候也照樣要一刻不停地辛苦爲人家做事等到我們的大數到來我們要靜靜地死去）她對於人生是肯定的她覺得人生的痛苦底安慰者不是消極的頽廢而是積極的工作這種勇敢的態度獻身的精神是全劇底主旨</p>
<p>記得託爾斯泰批評他說（柴霍甫之文具有印象派文人之所有似的自己獨特的樣式他的文章怡如毫不選擇任取身邊的顔料塗抹起來塗抹了的綫又仿佛毫不互相聨絡但略略走遠一看便發生可驚的感觸成着出色的圖畫就有這樣的趣致）這樣的圖畫竟在上海的中央大會堂（辛酉劇團公演的地點）當大衆之前展開了</p>
<h3>大夏大學添辦女子幼稚師範學校</h3>
<p>大夏大學當局近感於中國幼稚敎育之重要及幼稚園師資之缺乏爰經第七十三次校務會議議决自下學期起在新校舍添辦女子幼稚師範學校聘請幼稚敎育專家擔任敎授造就幼稚園師資人才以應國内需求現正積極籌備并已舉出該校副校長歐元懷敎務長魯繼曾敎育學院院長陳選善高師科主任黄敬思敎授董任堅等爲幼稚師範學校籌備委員云（季光）</p>
<h3>中國之地質研究概况</h3>
<p>中央研究院地質研究員葉良輔</p>
<p>我未講中國之地質研究概况以前先要說明地質學是一種什麽科學我們究竟要否研究牠</p>
<p>在十八世紀將完的時候歐洲有幾位學者注意到各種石層的排列和生長在石</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>層裏的生物遺跡如介殻之類把牠描寫記者比較并推究牠們的成因以後研究旣詳知識有了系統就成功一種專門研究地球歷史和地球上生物變遷的科學叫做地質學所以地質學的年紀才不過一百五十歲</p>
<p>我國人當初不講究科學的現在知道要研究科學了因爲國家窮的原故不能多設研究機關或是爲個人謀事易與不易就要問這科學是有用或没用說到這一層從地質兩字的字面上看來已可想得到這是對於礦業農業上木工程化學工程多很有關係的一種科學但是我們不能就拿應用範圍爲己足因爲不論那種科學要澈底解决和牠有關的應用問題總要對這科學有深切之知識和技能才行所以要研究中國的地質目標還是要在中國的地史如是可以包括一切在内一方面可拿牠應用到的一生事業一方面可增進世界的文化</p>
<p>外國人來中國研究地質的六十四年以來常常有人現在更多我們暫時不去說他至於中國人自己正式研究地質才從民國五年起現在我分研究機關實際　獻研究人才三項大致說說</p>
<p>（一）研究機關</p>
<p>民國一五年起北京政府的農商部設了個地質調查局後來改爲所於是每年春冬二季派人出去調查地質起初注重於煤鐵礦後來注重於地質的各方面以及礦產礦業的統計并且預備編製全國一百萬分之一的地質圖分張出版每張包括經度六度緯度四度直到如今一共出了三幅他們經費起初定爲每月三五千元自歸入國民政府農礦部以後擬增至一萬但十餘年來向未如數領到全靠辦事人的努力和各大礦公司及中華敎育文化基金委員會的協助在那裏進行除地質圖以外共出彙報十三期專報十三種又古生物誌四十種古生物誌這部書全世界的地質學者多要用到牠各本的作家有許多是外國著名學者所以名譽很好</p>
<p>民國八年江蘇實業廳請兩位專家調查全省地質礦產約有三年之久製成了五十萬分之一全圖一張二十五萬分之一分圖四幅報告一册</p>
<p>民國十一年中國地質學會成立所有中國地質學者和旅華的外國地質家多是會員這是討論學術的機關自己並無工作不過每年會誌一卷把會員送來的文章印成内中大多是重要新穎的貢獻同時北京大學地質學的敎授學生也常有研究結果發表民國十五年湖南設地質調查所經費雖有限但成績還好至今已共出報告八種</p>
<p>十六年兩廣地質調查所成立每月經費有一萬元可惜廣東氣候濕熱且地方不平靖羅致人才比較的困難論理這個地質調查所非常重要因爲西南的地質太不明瞭地方偏僻别地的人派去很不容易自從該所成立以後兩廣的地質逐漸明白他們出版過廿多本的臨時報告四種特别報告一卷正式年報第二卷年報已經付印不久也可見面了</p>
<p>十七年起中央研究院設立地質研究所於是研究中國地質的力量又增加一分不過這研究所的進行方針和全國或各省的地質調查所不很一樣他們想按照研究員的各人所長認定題目做些精細的研究凡歐美各學者最近所趨縱的研究方法和學理想把牠澈底的了解并且來做同類的研究因爲創辦以來才三年爲籌備已費去許多時間所以成績不多雖出版過集刋八種對於國内地質知識增加些貢獻但並不因此類工作而滿意</p>
<p>此外還有浙江建設廳的礦產調查所江西地質調查所多在萌芽時期（河南曾經也設過地質調查所）總之就過去來講中國地質研究的成績可說薈聚在北平凡游歷北平的人們值得去參觀他們的地質陳列館呢</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Issue of Border Clash between German and Polish Soldiers</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of the border clash between German and Polish soldiers, the Polish government has accepted the German government's proposal for the two countries to jointly form a committee to review the matter. The first meeting will be held today. This is also a major issue in the German-Polish dispute.</p>
<p>The truth of this matter is not yet fully known. However, according to German sources, the Polish soldiers who entered German territory were carrying firearms, clearly with aggressive intentions. The Polish report does not match the facts. It can be generally seen that the matter arose due to the issue of disputed borders. Poland's complex ethnic and linguistic composition makes it impossible to verify its old boundaries. After its restoration, the Paris Peace Conference could only provide a solution for the Polish territories occupied by Germany, Austria, and other countries. For example, parts of Posen Province, parts of West Prussia, and the Danzig area were all transferred from Germany to Poland. During the demarcation of the German-Polish border, the Germans expressed dissatisfaction, saying that the treaty sacrificed millions of German people. The Poles, on the other hand, felt that many demands had not been met and were not satisfied. Therefore, although the German-Polish border issue was resolved by the Peace Conference, in reality, it could not be clearly defined. This is why there are still many disputes today.</p>
<p>The Polish people have suffered greatly from national subjugation. They have not forgotten the various oppressions they suffered in the past and are striving to become strong and unwilling to compromise in the slightest. Germany is also deeply concerned about this. Therefore, it attaches great importance to this soldier clash, believing that Poland intends to invade. The Polish people also believe that Germany's military is advancing rapidly and is always trying to break free from the shackles of the treaty. They are also afraid that Germany's ambitions will be revived. Therefore, they are wary of Germany. The tense situation is for this reason. If the Border Clash Committee can reach a fair resolution, it will be fortunate for the people of both Germany and Poland. Otherwise, if the deadlock continues and opinions become deeper, the dispute may escalate further.</p>
<p>Important Domestic Telegrams Two</p>
<h3>Mutually Beneficial Military and Road Administration Measures</h3>
<p>Nanjing: Advisor to the General Headquarters, Pigeer, stated that the reason for the corruption of Chinese road administration is not the lack of well-educated and experienced road administrators, but the lack of systematic maintenance and political instability in engineering. He proposed a method for rectification and submitted it to the General Headquarters. The General Headquarters advocated three methods: A) If the road bureau is a military agency manufacturing or modifying various projects, it can first record the accounts, and the military agency will pay the full amount in the future. B) Military transportation should have specially stipulated freight rates and be recorded by the road bureau first, but the military agency must be responsible for paying it back. C) For various projects damaged by military action, part of the repair costs, after the amount is estimated, should be borne by the military agency. If these conditions can be followed, the good results obtained will not only benefit the national economy but also benefit the military. The General Headquarters' Staff Department has forwarded the proposal to the Ministry of Railways. After review, the Ministry believes that the reasons for the road administration's illness are quite relevant, but it can only be implemented with the support of military agencies. It has specially sent a letter to the General Headquarters to first decide on a method, and then the Ministry will convene a meeting to stipulate the details to facilitate both road administration and military affairs.

<p>Nanjing: The Ministry of Finance ordered the appointment of Li Xibai, inspector of the Salt Affairs Bureau, as the supervisor of the Jiangsu Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau, and Xiong Guanying as the supervisor of the Shandong Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wireless Electricity Conference Temporarily Postponed</h3>
<p>Nanjing: The Academia Sinica requested the government and the Executive Yuan to convene a conference of wireless electricity experts to stipulate the use of various wavelengths to avoid mutual interference of airborne radio waves. The Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Communications to handle the matter. The Ministry of Communications believed that the wireless electricity industry was originally under its jurisdiction. Previously, various military and political agencies and local governments had built radio stations without following the telecommunications regulations, and many had violated the various rules and wavelength allocation methods stipulated in the International Wireless Electricity Convention. It had planned to convene a meeting of relevant agencies to discuss the allocation of radio waves, stipulate call signs, and manage personnel. However, the suppression of the rebellion has begun, and many troops are using wireless electricity to transmit military messages. The number of radio stations has increased sharply, and radio wave interference has become very severe. It has decided to postpone the conference until the end of the military operations and then send letters to the relevant agencies to send personnel to discuss the matter together.

It is now stipulated that all equipment for chambers of commerce in inland counties and cities that should be distributed will be sent directly by the Ministry to the provincial agencies in charge of industry and commerce to find ways to forward them.

<p>Important Domestic Telegrams Three</p>
<h3>Zhao Pilian Mediates Opinions of Various Factions</h3>
<p>Beijing: The New Morning Post reports that Zhao Pilian is working hard to mediate party affairs and reach a compromise. A broad conference is expected to be established tomorrow. Whether the date will be changed depends on Wang Jingwei's reply telegram. However, the Reorganization Faction believes that the name of the broad conference should be changed to the Enlarged Meeting of the Second Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beijing: Hundreds of people visited Zhao's residence in Xiwa Factory yesterday and today, mostly unemployed officials. It is said that the organization of the Secretariat has been internally decided to be: Zhao Pilian, Tan Zhen, and Chen Gongbo as standing committee members, and few employees will be hired. Xie Jishi is receiving a stack of letters of recommendation. Recently, members of the Datong League have received funding, and the Sun Yat-senism Society has also received funding from the Western Hills Faction. However, the financial situation of the Reorganization Faction is slightly worse. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beijing: Today, Chen Gongbo used the Shanghai Second Congress Declaration to explain his foothold in the party, focusing on the special committees for clearing the party and opposing communism in Huanlong Road, etc. He believes that he is too aggressive and makes things difficult for the left-wing faction with the party system of the Second Congress in Guangdong, so he hopes to take into account the slightly. Today, Zhao Pilian mediated again. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beijing: Yu met Wang Faqin, Bai Yunti, and Chen Gongbo's wife in the park. According to them, the rumor that a declaration will be issued at the meeting tomorrow is not true. Most of those who signed the declaration are not in the north. Because the declaration states that it cannot be approved casually without the consent of the individual, if it is approved and the individual declares that they did not agree or need to modify or reserve a point, then the declaration will inevitably be invalid. Therefore, things must be done practically. We will send a telegram to Mr. Wang about Zhao Pilian's mediation process and the signatories of the declaration these days. It is unlikely to be replied immediately. The expanded meeting scheduled for tomorrow must be delayed slightly. In short, party affairs can only be decided by Mr. Wang's arrival. At this moment, mediation based on intention is not really reliable. Now, Tan Zhen told me that Zhao Zhiqing's efforts to mediate these days are very thorough, but the left-wing faction is unwilling to sacrifice the party system, which caused me to be blamed by a certain gentleman. I am really wronged. As for the Shanghai Second Congress Declaration, I have already drafted it, and my side has multiple positions. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>British House of Commons Debates Unemployment Issue, Conservative Motion Defeated</h3>
<p>London, Associated Press, 28th - Today in the House of Commons, Conservative leader Baldwin initiated a debate on the motion to censure Thomas's handling of unemployment, making the atmosphere in the House as tense as if charged with electricity. The members' seats and the gallery were filled to capacity. Both the government party and the Conservative Party had previously instructed their members to attend in full force to increase momentum. During Baldwin's speech, Conservative members repeatedly applauded and cheered, while the government party responded with jeers. The content generally stated that the increase in the number of unemployed was due to the Coal Mines Act, which increased the cost of coal, and other industries feared that the government would interfere with their operations in the same way. The fact that Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden refused to pay attention to tariffs was also a reason. The final victory can be regarded as clear evidence that domestic support for protective tariffs and imperial tariffs is increasing, etc. MacDonald's rebuttal strongly stated that protective tariffs cannot alleviate unemployment, and the fact that the United States and Germany adopted protective taxes but the number of unemployed did not decrease can be a clear proof. He also said that the Conservative Party's victory in the Nottingham election cannot be regarded as a sign that support for protective taxes is increasing. According to this case, although it shook for a while, its results are not difficult to foresee because the Liberal Party will abandon voting, so the government party can control victory.</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 28th - Today, the House of Commons, by a vote of 270 to 241, rejected the motion proposed by Conservative Baldwin to reduce the salary of Minister Thomas, who is in charge of unemployment affairs. Baldwin cited guaranteeing industries as the only solution to unemployment. Prime Minister MacDonald asked all parties to cooperate in reducing unemployment, and said that the government intends to convene meetings of municipal councils across the country to promote public works. Mosley, who resigned and withdrew from the cabinet a few days ago due to disagreements with the cabinet, suggested establishing an unemployment office under the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister. Thomas said that the government relies on construction, reorganization, rationalization, and rectification of factories so that British manufacturers can compete in the world export market in a fair and just manner. During the vote, Liberal Party members and six left-wing members of the Labour Party did not vote.</p>

<h3>Central Propaganda Department Hosts Press Conference</h3>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference in the Central Second Conference Hall at 2 PM on the 29th, with more than 20 reporters from various newspapers attending. Liu Luyin, the chairman, reported the following: (1) The Central Propaganda Department recently discussed the method of promoting the Gregorian calendar with various departments of the National Government and has agreed on several specific measures. It will instruct party branches and governments in various places to work hard to promote it so that the Gregorian calendar will be uniformly implemented nationwide starting from January 1 next year. (2) After Yan Xishan's rebellion, the Beiping Daobao was taken over, and Xin Bosen was appointed to preside over the newspaper. Xin was a strong advocate of the monarchy during Yuan Shikai's time. After taking over the newspaper, he made many fallacies. The Shanghai Millard's Review has strongly refuted it. Yan's intention to use Xin is to use Xin's power to collude with imperialism so that he can gain the sympathy of Britain and the United States. However, since Yan organized the Beiping Diplomatic Office and appointed Zhu Hexiang as the director, he has repeatedly contacted the diplomatic corps without any results. Therefore, Yan's attempt is expected to be ineffective. (3) Today, according to reports, Xuchang was captured by our army the night before. The enemy troops on the Longhai and Jinpu Railways have also completely collapsed. In the future, the war will focus on Zhengzhou. Once our army attacks, it can be resolved in a short period of time. (4) The Mongolian Conference officially opened today. The Central Government has great hopes for the conference. After the report was completed, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Central Army Attacks Xinzheng</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou states that after the recovery of Linying, Fancheng, Xiangcheng, and Yexian were also captured in succession. The Central Army has made significant progress. At the same time, areas north of Linying along the east and west sides of the railway, as well as Zhuanggou, Zhangwangmengji, Dashiqiao, and Jiangliji, were also occupied by the Central Army one after another. Xuchang is thus surrounded. On the 27th, the Central Army launched a major northward advance and completely recovered Xuchang Railway Station and nearby important areas. They immediately launched a fierce attack on Xuchang. The entire air force and the 5th Armored Train Team, as well as the Pingmin and Minsheng, also participated in the attack. The intensity of the artillery fire and bombs was unprecedented. The enemy troops besieged in Xuchang, in addition to the remnants of Fan Zhongxiu's troops, also included a part of Pang Bingxun's troops. Fan's troops had been defeated repeatedly and their morale was low. Fan himself was seriously injured in the battle of Linying and could not personally supervise the battle. Therefore, the defense of the city was entirely the responsibility of Pang's troops. However, Pang's troops in Xuchang were originally very weak. Under the threat of Central Army bombs and artillery fire, there were many casualties, and Xinzheng was in critical condition. The enemy had no reinforcements to go south. It is expected that it will be completely captured in a day or two. He Chengjun and Xu Yuanquan believed that the remnants of the enemy in Xuchang could be resolved and that it was only necessary to send troops to monitor them without having to concentrate all their forces to besiege them. They specially directed the main force to continue to advance and were reportedly approaching Xinzheng. Once Xinzheng is recovered, Zhengzhou will also be easily resolved. It has been verified that the ones fighting against the Central Army this time, in addition to Zhang Weixi and others from Feng's troops in the Lushan and Yexian area, are Fan Zhongxiu and Ren Yingqi's troops on the Pinghan front. Fan and Ren's troops have been more than half resolved in the battle of Linying. In the future, the main force of Feng's army will be involved in combat. The following is a copy of Xu Yuanquan's telegram of victory received by the headquarters: (1) The 48th Division's Zhang Zhenhan Brigade surrounded and attacked the enemy in Linying on the morning of the 25th. The rebels Fan Zhongxiu and Ren Yingqi personally led the main force to attack our Qilitou positions from the Zhouxiangzhai and Wulihe Yinchang line. After our officers and soldiers bravely defeated them, the rebels Fan and Ren retreated to the Zhouxiangzhai position. The enemy in Wulihe Yinchang retreated to the city and still attempted to counterattack from time to time. After the addition of the Han Brigade and Dong Regiment of our department, and ordering the Zhang Brigade to exert its full strength on the night of the 25th, after the enemy's defeat, they exerted their utmost efforts to attack from the west, south, and north gates. At the same time, they selected more than 200 brave teams to surpass the city walls in the area south of the city. At about 1 AM on the 26th, the Linying County was completely occupied by our brave teams. After many hours of street fighting, the enemy began to collapse from the east gate and fled to the outside of the city. Our troops outside the city intercepted and attacked, and the enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties. Many prisoners were captured and are being interrogated. According to the prisoners, the rebel Fan Zhongxiu was seriously injured and disappeared. The rebel army in the city was bombed by our planes for several days, and more than half were killed or injured. Zhang Brigade has been ordered to guard Linying County, and the rest of the Han Changjun Brigade will cooperate with our 9th Army to advance towards Xuchang, and Xiao Division will attack Yingqiao Jiyuan area, and then turn to Xinzheng. At 10 AM this morning, the vanguard of our 9th Army had arrived at the Qiumei Zhai Zhang Temple line. The Zhang Han Brigade had arrived near the Qidang Zhai railway line, and the enemy in the Zhang Pan Street area was collapsing towards the area north of Xuchang. Our army can occupy Xuchang tonight. Xu Yuanquan Ma Dengying kowtow (2) The Han Changjun Brigade of our army's 48th Division and Xiao Zhichu Division launched a courageous attack on the enemy in the Chen Ce Store, Chahe, Yan Maixu, and Huo Yan Town areas east of Xiangcheng at dawn on the 24th. After a day of fierce fighting, they defeated the enemy and occupied Chen Ce Store and Chahe, while the Xiao Division occupied Huo Yan Town. On the 25th, the Han Brigade continued to advance along the west side of the railway, defeating the main force near Fancheng south of Xuchang and occupying Fancheng. The Xiao Division is fiercely attacking the enemy east of Xiangcheng and can be captured sooner or later. On the 26th, the two armies planned to attack Xuchang. Our morale is very high, and Xuchang will be captured soon. Also, the enemy Fan Zhongxiu's troops in Linying are currently being surrounded by the Zhang Zhenhan Brigade of our army, and it is expected that all will be disarmed. In the past two days, more than 300 enemy troops have been killed, and many prisoners have been captured. Xu Yuanquan Ma Dengying kowtow (May 28)</p>
<h3>Han's Troops Repel Jin Army in Northern Shandong</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan states that Fu Zuoyi's troops attacked Luokou early on the 25th and were repelled by Han Fuju's troops. They are still building fortifications nearby in an attempt to resist. It was not until last night that they were completely repelled by Han's troops. The plainclothes team of enemy troops near Qingcheng was also repelled. The front line on the railway is still facing off near Yucheng. Han Fuju returned to Jinan from the front on the afternoon of the 25th and immediately held a military meeting with Ma Hongkui and Jiang Bocheng. At 2 AM this morning, He Yaozu, Chief of Staff of the National Government, and Zhang Yue, Chief of Staff of the First Army, returned to Jinan by special train and personally gave Han and Ma the Central Government's plans for the military affairs in northern Shandong. The following is a copy of the telegram of victory released by the First Army Corps today: (1) Around Qingcheng, 200 to 300 enemy plainclothes team were found. After checking, they were not troops but Huimin County Militia that were being used by the enemy. A regiment of infantry has been dispatched to counterattack them head-on and will not be difficult to eliminate. Enemy troops were found in Anren Street and Zhang Li Store, about 40 miles northwest of Yancheng. They were repelled by our Tang Brigade, which occupied the area. Currently, our army is confronting the enemy north of Yucheng. (2) Fu Zuoyi's troops, the 28th and 29th Divisions, consisting of four infantry regiments attached to the cavalry artillery, invaded Luokou at dawn on the 25th. After our Qiao Brigade counterattacked head-on from the vicinity of Queshan, they collapsed towards Zhao Jia Zhuang and Jiao Jia Ji and built fortifications in an attempt to resist stubbornly. After our Rong Brigade advanced from Sangzidian Yancheng to Sunjiazhuang Chenji, attacking the enemy's rear, the enemy began to collapse towards Fengjiazhuang Xinji and Xiakou Town. More than 300 enemy officers and soldiers were killed in this battle, more than 100 were captured alive, dozens of rifles were seized, and one enemy regimental commander was killed. (3) At 2 PM on the 25th, the Tang Brigade on the left wing drove out the enemy in Anren Street, killing dozens of them and capturing more than a dozen horses. The enemy in the rear has been completely suppressed. (4) From 3 PM on the 25th, the enemy launched several attacks on our positions in Yucheng and the railway station and were repelled by our army each time. Hundreds of enemies were killed on the spot.

<h3>Financial Reorganization in Heilongjiang Province (Continued)</h3>
<p>After the provincial government approved Yu Youren's proposal, it immediately instructed the Department of Finance to notify and handle it and telegraphed to various counties to comply with it. When the Department of Finance received the instruction, it immediately convened people from all walks of life and the banking group to the Guangxin Company and sealed the ticket printing machine. The Director of the Department, Pang Zuoping, reported on the financial situation of Heilongjiang Province, saying that in the past, the province's finances were always in deficit, and the Guangxin Company subsidized 4 million yuan each year, not including the money used by the military headquarters. Since the fiscal year of the Republic of China 17 (July 1, 1928 to June 30, 1929 is a fiscal year), the province's finances have been vigorously reorganized and more than 1.2 million yuan in harsh and detailed taxes have been reduced and exempted. Not only is the revenue and expenditure suitable, but there is also some surplus. It is estimated that the revenue for this fiscal year is more than 21 million yuan and the expenditure is about 19 million yuan. The revenue and expenditure are roughly 2 million yuan. In addition, special donation revenue is about 5 million yuan. When the 18th fiscal year began, the estimated expenditure was about 22 million yuan, and the revenue could also be offset, and the tax rate and harsh and detailed taxes were reduced and exempted by another 2 million yuan. However, shortly thereafter, the Russian incident occurred, and the tax revenue of various items was inevitably reduced. Fortunately, after trying to reorganize it, the seat tax revenue for this year reached about 21 million yuan, which can still be suitable for expenditure. In addition, special donation revenue is also about 6 million yuan. The defense expenses for the Russian anti-aggression was the appropriation of 11 million yuan from special donations in the 17th and 18th fiscal years. Therefore, in the past two years, the provincial government has not been padded a single cent by the Guangxin Company, and there is still 5 million yuan of treasury funds in the company. As for the military headquarters, since Commander Wan arrived in Jiang, all expenses have been allocated by the provincial treasury, and they have never taken a penny from the Guangxin Company. The true financial situation of the province in the past two years is like this, and I believe everyone understands it. The reason for the current shortage of money tickets and rough money is actually that it has been gradually issued for more than ten years and has already been oversupplied. In stable years, it can still pass safely, but once there is an accident, it will inevitably have an impact. For example, in the summer of the 17th year, it once reached more than 300 yuan per string. Later, due to the stable political situation and the efforts of the authorities, it gradually increased and reached the level of more than 230 yuan per string last year. Unfortunately, the Russian incident occurred, and the market fluctuated again. After all parties made every effort to maintain it, although it did not change suddenly, most of the current money in the province was remitted abroad due to the urgency of the Russian incident, resulting in a sudden financial shortage in the local area. All money ticket adjustments are difficult, so there is the recent phenomenon. The company authorities are very anxious about this situation and have proposed sealing the printer and stopping the printing of new tickets. However, in order to be prudent, the Department of Finance proposed it to the provincial government for a meeting and passed it. The provincial chairman instructed to implement it, etc.</p>

<h3>Formal Opening of the Mongolian Conference</h3>
<p>The Mongolian Conference held its opening ceremony at 9 a.m. on the 29th in the auditorium of the Lizi Society. A large number of representatives from the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, ministers of various courts, and representatives from various agencies attended. Chairman Ma Fuxiang described the opening situation as follows:</p>
<p>The venue was decorated with a presidium seat and seats for representatives of the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and ministers of various courts on the altar, and representative seats below, divided into three rows of twenty seats each. The venue was covered with slogans and various pictures such as "Support small and weak ethnic groups, relieve the suffering of the people, complete autonomy, unite against foreign countries, and suggest to the central government with overall interests."</p>
<p>Opening Order (1) Meeting (2) All stand at attention (3) Play music (4) Sing the Party song (5) Bow three times to the portrait of the Premier and the Party and national flags (6) Read the Premier's will respectfully (7) Three minutes of silence (8) Chairman's opening speech (9) Instruction (10) Speech (11) Reply (12) Play music (13) Ceremony complete (14) Photography. Representatives of each league and banner attended the meeting: Representatives of Jerim League: Su Baolin, Uertu Nasutu, Amin Wuertu, Chong Abaladan, Sengge, Ge Mingge, Na Da Mude, Boyan Mandu Chaoge, Boyan Dugar Zhabu, Zosotu League representatives: Li Fang, Guo Wentian, Dai Qinglian, Wu Heling, Na Da Mude, Enhe Amur, Chen Xiaoliang, Tong Jizhong, Bai Guizhang, Chen Mongolian Conference formally opened.</p>
<p>If you are selfish or hesitant, or stubborn and unchanging, you will miss a good opportunity, and you will inevitably regret it too late. This is something that must be carefully considered. The task of this conference is to study the actual situation in Mongolia and promote political tutelage and construction. All matters that should be promoted or reformed should be discussed one by one during the meeting within this scope. However, I, as chairman, must say something to all members first, that is, the central and local representatives are requested to put aside their inherent prejudices when discussing everything and take an objective attitude as the standard for solving problems. The central representatives must fully consider the special circumstances of Mongolia within the possible scope of not violating the party's doctrine, and must not be biased towards radicalism. The Mongolian representatives should also take the party's doctrine and the world trend as the basis for preserving the inherent good system, and strive to understand the central government's painstaking efforts to make overall plans and take care of everything, and must not be biased towards conservatism. In this way, internal and external coordination and mutual understanding between the old and the new will not only avoid the criticism of playing music on a glued pillar, but also avoid the criticism of cutting feet to fit shoes, and can achieve a perfect result. I hope that all my wise members will learn from and accept this humble sincerity.</p>
<p>Instruction from the Central Representative Then, Tan Yankai, the representative of the Central Party Headquarters, gave an instruction, saying briefly that the representatives climbed mountains and sailed across the sea, traveling with difficulty to Beijing to participate in the conference. Their courageous spirit is admirable. The colleagues of the Central Committee follow the Premier's Greater China Nationalism to seek freedom and equality among ethnic groups, and then seek freedom and equality in the international arena. Therefore, the Mongolian Conference was convened to imitate the Fan Zhao. Representatives of Udat League: Alaten Eqier, Zhao Fuyue, Zhao Jingshen, Bao Fuhuan, Yang Xiuchun, Gong Shou, Fu Changling, Jin Youcai, Yang Yincun, Chang Wenkui, Representatives of Hulunbuir: Fuling, Peng Chuke Da, Mengda, Wu Shuanghai, Puerbu, Chunde Yikeming Anqi representatives: Hakin Surong Mende Bayar, representatives of East and West Butha: Guo Wenxing, Du Shuangshou, Dehong Suxingbao, representatives of Liaoning Province: Yuan Qingen, representatives of Jilin Province: Li Fangchun, representatives of Heilongjiang Province: Xu Lin, representatives of Rehe Province: Wang Shiren.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech After the opening ceremony and salutations, Chairman Ma Fuxiang delivered an opening speech, briefly saying that the establishment of this conference was based on the resolution of the second plenary session of the third Central Executive Committee on June 17, 18th year. The convening period was originally scheduled before March of the 19th year, but due to various difficulties such as remote roads, changes in the situation, and traffic obstructions, the committee has repeatedly requested and approved postponements until today, when the purpose of the meeting has been achieved. It is indeed a fortunate event. During the preparation period, the various courts and ministries sent important personnel to cooperate with the committee and work together to formulate progress, which shows that our central government attaches importance to the border areas and is far from being comparable to the perfunctory and irrelevant behavior of the former imperial military閥時代. If we who are involved in this conference can fulfill the responsibility of building a new Mongolia and devote our wisdom and sincerity to seeking long-term happiness for the people of all Mongolia, then we can live up to the central government's earnest efforts to govern and comfort the Mongolian people's expectations for governance. This achievement will stand immortal with the Inner and Outer Hinggan Mountains. On the contrary, if we respond perfunctorily, break the previous bad system, and unite all Mongolian people under the guidance of the Three People's Principles to enjoy various political benefits and complete an extremely powerful and consolidated country, the Mongolian compatriots account for the majority of the entire Chinese nation. Due to the mistakes of the Manchu Qing government's policy of appeasement and deception, progress has been inevitably obstructed. Now the central government has decided to adopt the public opinion of the majority on Mongolian politics and reverse the previous bad policies. The representatives should also be aware that the country is in the midst of seeking governance and work together to assist the great unity and construction during the period of political tutelage, express the spirit of the great Chinese nation, and make politics increasingly prosperous. Instruction from the representative of the National Government Then, Kong Xiangxi, the representative of the National Government, gave an instruction, saying briefly that the biggest goal of the central government's construction of politics is to reform all bad systems, seek the happiness of the entire nation, resist imperialist aggression, and realize the freedom and equality of the country. The establishment of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission was originally a political agency representing Mongolia and Tibet, but in order to solve the entire political problem, it was necessary to convene a general conference. What the central government hopes from the representatives is: (1) Abstractly contribute the advantages and disadvantages of Mongolian politics to the government; (2) Convey to the leagues and banners the difference between the policies adopted by the central government towards Mongolia and the autocratic government, so that all the Mongolian people can understand; (3) The resolutions of each case must be discussed from a practical perspective and not involve empty talk; (4) Use all your strength to help the country's construction, so that the Mongolian nation and the Chinese nation can both achieve great happiness.</p>
<p>Speeches by Guests The speakers included Ma Hetian, the representative of the Examination Yuan, Zhang Fengjiu, the representative of the Legislative Yuan, and Wu Heling, the director of the Mongolian Affairs Office. Wu's speech mainly said that the Mongolian people have a sincere understanding of the central government. Although the representatives have not all arrived, the spirit of the various Mongolian leagues and banners has been fully expressed. The environment in which Inner Mongolia is located is extremely bad, and although it is oppressed by white imperialism, it is not moved. Considering that during the Sino-Russian incident last year, Hulunbuir was temporarily turbulent, but the maintenance of Mongolian officials was effective and order was soon restored. In short, the Mongolian nation is a part of the Chinese nation and should of course unanimously support the central government and assume the responsibility of construction to ensure that everything in Mongolia is in line with the trend of party rule. At the same time, it is also hoped that the central government and Mongolia will merge into one and strive to promote it forward.</p>
<p>Reply by Representatives After the speeches, Yang Yincun was pushed to give a reply, saying: "The representatives are honored to participate in this grand event and are extremely happy. I would like to express a few words to express my sincerity. I believe that our Premier is a world pioneer who supports the weak and gives sincere guidance. He is a teacher and protector to our people. The instructions of the authorities are precious. The unification has been completed, and the people of the border areas of Mongolia and Tibet are happily looking forward to it. The unprecedented grand meeting is inspiring and joyful. Thousands of miles of the desert will be renewed every day. The representatives are honored to be involved in this grand event and deeply regret their lack of talent and fear of failing their mission. Fortunately, all the participants are advanced. I hope that the leaders will instruct us with great care. Before the opening of the Mongolian Affairs Conference, I respectfully offer my sincerity and pray that the great achievements will be passed down from generation to generation and that our party and country will last for hundreds of millions of years." After the speech, photography and adjournment were held. It is heard that the first general meeting will be held at the Lizi Society at 3 pm tomorrow (30th).</p>
<h3>Wuhu Quick Mail</h3>
<p>The 3rd Battalion of the Capital Garrison Regiment stationed in Wuhu, which was sent to Guangde to suppress bandits, recently sent a telegram to the regiment headquarters reporting that the battalion had broken up a group of bandits in the Dushan area the day before, killing more than 20 bandits and capturing two bandit leaders alive, who were executed on the spot, and seized more than a dozen long and short guns. Yesterday, the well-known bandit leader Li Xiaokuaizi's group was completely wiped out, killing about 40 bandits and seizing more than 30 rifles. Li Xiaokuaizi was also beheaded and his head was displayed to the public. The main group of bandits in the entire territory of Guangde has been wiped out. After receiving the report, the regimental headquarters telegraphed to order Battalion Commander Feng to lead two companies to Guangde to suppress the town.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance stipulates that Anhui Province must still report 1.6 million yuan to the central government after the abolition of the Likin tax. The Anhui Finance Special Commissioner's Office has specially organized a Special Consumption Tax Committee. However, since the special tax revenue is only 600,000 yuan per year, which is still 1 million yuan short, it is planned to hold an inland consumption tax to offset it. The Anhui Provincial Chamber of Commerce and the Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce held a joint meeting this afternoon to discuss the results. The joint meeting decided that the inland consumption tax is no different from Likin, which is difficult to approve. It was decided to jointly send a letter to the Special Commissioner's Office to express their opposition.</p>
<p>Yu Mingxun, the director of the Wuhu Municipal Public Security Bureau, said that after the bandit disaster in southern Anhui was searched and suppressed by the troops sent by the Garrison Regiment to various counties, it has been mostly wiped out and the local area is gradually becoming peaceful. The Public Security Brigade, which was jointly organized by the Public Security Bureau, the Self-Defense Regiment, and the Chamber of Commerce, is no longer necessary to exist. It was specially announced yesterday that it would be abolished.</p>
<p>Wuhu rice shortage There are four Pingtiao Bureaus in the urban area. The near four villages have also repeatedly petitioned the county government and the People's Food Maintenance Association to add Pingtiao Bureaus at appropriate locations in the four villages to provide relief. The county government has ordered the gentry and directors of the four villages to investigate the actual number of accumulated grains so as to prepare for the establishment. (27th)</p>
<p>Local Communication</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>A false alarm about a bandit ship in the eastern suburbs Yesterday (28th) in the evening, two Jiangbei boats came and were docked in the Guozixiangkou area outside the east gate to cook. A certain rice store there saw that their behavior was suspicious and reported to the fourth sub-station to drive them away. It was rumored that the bandit ship was plotting to loot. For a time, the market was panicked. The district patrol officer reported to the General Bureau and asked the county police team to rush to arrest them. Three Jiangbei people, Xu Ada, Wang Asan, and Wang Asi, were detained on the boat and escorted to the bureau. There were also seven children, three women, two bags of white rice, and worn-out clothes and bedding on the boat. That night, they were detained in the Public Security Bureau and ordered the city to be strictly guarded for emergencies. According to Xu Ada and others, they did not admit that they were bandits or resisted arrest. The reason was that the report from the sub-station in the district to the Public Security Bureau stated that when they went to arrest them, they saw a person carrying a gun ashore and escaping. The police fired a gun and he also returned fire, and claimed that there were a total of six boats, and four boats also escaped. However, according to Xu and others, there were only three men and two boats, and no one carrying a gun landed and escaped or fired back. People in the eastern suburbs said that they were initially alarmed by rumors, but later saw that the detainees had no contraband and had not heard any gunshots, which was inevitably exaggerated.</p>
<p>Director Zhu recently went to Guozixiang to investigate and found no traces of bandit counterattacks or resistance as reported. The items on the boat were not evidence of bandits, so the official office will conduct a serious investigation and review after clarifying the facts.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Replacement of the head of the anti-smuggling team After Lou Ziyun, the head of the 6th Anti-Smuggling Brigade in Suzhou, was dismissed and replaced by Chi Tingxian, Song Huaiqing, the head of the 6th Anti-Smuggling Gate Water Patrol Team, was ordered by the Jiangsu Anti-Smuggling Bureau to be transferred to the 6th Brigade Headquarters as a special agent yesterday (29th). The vacancy was filled by Shen Junxian.</p>
<p>The water police arrested bandits and sent them to the court. Water police detectives Yu Zibin and others arrested the bandit Cai Jinfu (also known as Chen Jinfu) at the Panru Lane intersection of Lindun the day before (28th). After being reviewed by Director Gong, he confessed that he had gathered a crowd to rob the families of Yan Rushan and Zhang Jingao, villagers of Xiaobaitang, Yangshuhang, Lu Cemetery, outside the Qimen on April 1st. At that time, he divided four liters of rice. After Director Gong confessed, he prepared a document and sent it to the local court for handling.</p>
<p>Reorganization of the Chamber of Commerce The Suzhou General Chamber of Commerce specially prepared to reorganize because the term of office of the committee members had expired. The County Party Department believed that the Chamber of Commerce had not been authorized by the Party Department and could not reorganize without authorization. It was decided to send a letter to the county government to inform the General Chamber of Commerce to stop the reorganization.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Resumption of Fire Fighting The president of the Zhongsan District Fire Brigade, Guo Linshan, was unfortunately detained due to a conflict between the fire brigades in each district and the members of the Public Security Bureau. Each fireman stopped fighting fires for four months, which was not a blessing for the local area. A general meeting of all members was specially convened in the association at 2 pm on the 28th to discuss the resumption of fire fighting measures. After discussion, it was decided that from now on, when a fire occurs, they will still fight fires as usual to fulfill their duties.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Retired patrol officer commits suicide after investigation Gu Lie, a patrol officer of the 10th sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau in Houqiao Town, Beishang Township, 9th District (40 years old, from Wenzhou), was recently ordered by Director Huang to be transferred to the bureau for appointment. The vacancy was filled by Yuan Mingqian. After receiving the order, Gu handed over his duties immediately, but due to extreme economic difficulties and the difficulty of maintaining the livelihood of a family of three, he was severely stimulated mentally and developed the idea of ​​being tired of the world. The afternoon before, Gu accompanied the petition delegation representatives Pu Yongbin and Pu Xiaogu, etc. who were retained by the director of the district Jiang, and took a steamer to the city and stayed in Room 73 of the Qitai Inn on Tongyun Road. After the petition delegation arrived in the city, they took the opportunity to petition Director Huang of the Public Security Bureau to retain Inspector Gu. As a result, they did not get the point. That night, Gu hosted a banquet for the petition delegation representatives at the Xinju Feng restaurant in Xicheng Jiao. After the banquet was over, Gu returned to his residence and suddenly went out to a pharmacy to buy two bottles of Babbittong sedative pills (ten pills in total). He took them back to his residence and swallowed all the sedative pills at about 1:00 am in the middle of the night, covered himself with a quilt and went to bed. At 1:00 pm yesterday morning, the waiter Sun Asi did not see Gu getting up and became suspicious. He immediately opened the door and went inside to see him. He saw Gu lying stiffly on the bed, calling him but he didn't respond, and pushing him but he didn't move. At that time, the petition delegation representatives heard the news and came to visit, and were shocked. They immediately hired someone to carry Gu to the Brothers Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Because he had taken too many drugs, there was a danger to his life. Afterwards, the petition representatives also found a suicide note in Gu's residence, addressed to Director Jiang, which roughly meant that he had no face to return to his hometown and could only commit suicide. After his death, please send his family back and do not examine the body. At the end of the letter, he also asked the hotel not to report to the authorities. Two empty bottles of sleeping pills were also found beside the pillow, so they were reported to the county government for investigation and handling. At the same time, his family was notified to come to the city to take care of the matter.</p>
<p>The giant bandit of Xinghua was arrested in Xixi. Liang Bi, the county magistrate of Xinghua, reported the day before that the police team stationed in Nanyao She in the county was surrounded by the giant bandit Liu Kunshan (also known as Liu Sanye) and resisted the enemy, killing eight policemen. It was learned that the bandit had sneaked into Xixi and was hiding in Yingbai Bridge outside the west gate. He specially sent a letter to the local county magistrate Sun to order the police to arrest him. After receiving the letter, County Magistrate Sun immediately ordered Huang Zhenbai, the director of the Public Security Bureau, to transfer Xue Furui, the captain of the detective team, and Wang Jinbiao, the deputy captain, and team member Chen Renbo to go to the address for arrest. Yesterday at noon, the giant bandit Liu Kunshan was seen walking towards him in front of the Xinju Fengyuan restaurant at Beicheng Jiao, and he was arrested immediately. He was immediately taken to the bureau and transferred to the county government for interrogation, detained, and informed the Xinghua County to send police to Xixi to escort him back for legal action.</p>
<p>The police team arrested thieves and sent them to the county. Recently, the headquarters of the county police brigade received a secret report that the thief Wang Yongquan (also known as Xiao Wangquan) was hiding on a cocoon boat in Sanliqiao outside the north gate. The suspect and the escaped prisoner Yuan Asan had committed crimes together. Please send the police to arrest him quickly. After receiving the report, Brigade Commander Zhu immediately ordered Liao Dajin, the leader of the detective team, to lead the detectives to the cocoon boat, where they arrested Wang. They immediately took the team to transfer him to the county government. Yesterday afternoon, Cheng, the reviewing officer of Yu, opened a court to interrogate the thief Wang Yongquan, who confessed that he and six accomplices had robbed a sailing ship from Qianwang Town to Changzhou in August last year and divided the spoils. Cheng immediately ordered him to be shackled and detained for verification. The third sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau outside the south gate arrested a suspected thief, Wang Ji, near Shangpailou yesterday. He was immediately taken to the bureau and interrogated by Director Zhu of the sub-bureau. After the interrogation, he prepared a document and sent it to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>The Tangjiaba robbery case The police of Wuyi Public Security 5th Sub-bureau has arrested the bandits who robbed Shi Xingda, a farmer in Tangjiaba, which is under the jurisdiction of the fifth sub-bureau. Shi Xingda's wife, Liu, was shot and killed on the night of March 26th this year. After the case was reported, it was being investigated. On the 27th of this month, the plaintiff Shi Xingda suddenly met a person named Gu Binglin on the way, who was definitely the murderer who shot and killed his wife Liu. He immediately handed him over to the Public Security 5th Sub-bureau for investigation. After preliminary interrogation by Director Gu, he was sent to the county court for trial on the 28th.</p>
<p>News about the cocoon market in the weighing Middle cocoon In Wuyi, the cocoon shops in the northeastern village and others first weighed cocoons on the 28th and 29th, while the southwestern village was slightly delayed by one or two days. The amount of fresh cocoons collected by each shop was only 40% of that of last year, and the cocoons were not very good. Approximately three loads and one to twenty catties of fresh cocoons are needed to dry one load of cocoons. The cocoon merchants hope that the silk market may pick up in the future due to the shortage of goods this year. Regarding Qishuyan, each cocoon shop collected more than 1,000 loads on the 27th, which was the most prosperous market. On the 28th, the situation had become dilapidated and each shop only collected 200 loads, with the market price being around 60 yuan. The scale was stopped in the afternoon of the 29th.

The scale was stopped about one or two days later.</p>

<p>Strict defense in the four villages The bandit disaster in Tongyi is urgent. Representatives from military, political, police, party, and local communities jointly formed a provisional defense committee. The second meeting was held on the 28th to discuss important defense and suppression cases. It was decided that (1) each district should hold a group defense to supplement the original number of guns to at least 200. The bandit districts should quickly purchase them, and the non-bandit districts and the neighboring bandit districts should complete them within one month. (2) Each district should establish a district defense committee with a fixed number of 9 to 13 members to be established soon. (3) The defenses in Jinsha and other places are tight. Three forts have been built and electric nets have been set up at the key points.</p>

The county government is unable to cope with it and has submitted it to the province for approval. The current instruction is to temporarily follow the old rules until the budget is slightly improved and then discuss the change method. A bandit leader was shot. The garrison in Jinsha arrested a bandit leader, Sheng Miaokun, in Sanle Village. He confessed without denial and was shot on the spot.</p>

<p>Dingfengyong Silk Factory Faces Another Dispute: After the Zhenjiang Dingfengyong Silk Factory started work, the County Industrial Consolidation Association sent a letter to factory owner Zhang Shaoqin, based on the requirements of the silk reeling trade union, to arrange a meeting to discuss and sign an agreement. However, Zhang did not attend and fired the leader of the silk reeling trade union's group. Wang Siniang, a member of the standing committee of the silk reeling trade union, stepped forward to negotiate, but the factory accused Wang Siniang of inciting a strike and fired her. The public was indignant, and all trade unions expressed their sympathy. The County Industrial Consolidation Association, not wanting the dispute to escalate, personally visited manager Zhang Shaoqin the day before yesterday in the hope of a quick resolution, but he refused to meet. Yesterday afternoon, he replied, but there was still no news by the evening. The workers were furious and went on strike. The Industrial Consolidation Association advised the workers to wait patiently for a solution, and sent another letter to the factory asking them to meet sincerely. However, the factory still adhered to its uncooperative stance. The Industrial Consolidation Association considered the capital's stubbornness and planned to report it to the provincial party headquarters for handling.</p>

<p>Qixian Refugees Come to Yangzhou to Raise Funds: One hundred and eighty-four refugees from Qixian County, Henan Province, carrying passports from the county government, came to Yangzhou and sent representatives, including Deng, to solicit donations from shops. On the afternoon of the 28th, while soliciting donations near the Ximen Chenggen area, they forcibly demanded more money from Yang Shaoqing, the chief secretary of the Luge Office. Yang reported this to the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau, which sent eight police officers to accompany the representatives along the streets to solicit donations to prevent them from arbitrarily extorting money from the shops and causing conflicts.</p>
<p>Prelude to Small Wheel Competition: The Inland Dada Company is launching Zhen Tai routes due to Li Tong's breach of contract (Dada does not operate Zhen routes, and Li Tong and others do not operate Tai Tong and other ports, as previously agreed). A ferry to Zhenjiang and Tongzhou will be added and is scheduled to begin operations on June 10. The Zhen Tong Company has also chartered a small ferry and will soon open a route from Zhenjiang to Taizhou. All of Dada's salt transport routes will be temporarily suspended due to banditry.</p>
<p>Fishing Boat Robbed in Broad Daylight: This morning (28th) at 10:00 AM, a fisherman surnamed Fu sold fish for over fifty yuan inside the fish market outside Benyi Gate in this county.

The two bandits immediately boarded the boat and robbed all the money from the fish sales.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Homicide in Zhongdai Township: At the back of the Guanyintang Temple in Xiaxiang, Zhongdai Town, Jiaxing, a thug suddenly appeared at the home of Ma Xinfu the other day. The thug pulled out a pistol and shot Ma Xinfu on the spot, killing Ma's daughter-in-law, Xu, and Xu's son, Wen Zhao (aged 14). The murderer fled immediately. Afterwards, Xinfu was sent to Jiaxing Gospel Hospital for treatment. The local branch was notified and sent personnel to inspect. Ma Xu and Ma Wenzhao both died from fatal injuries from the bullets. Ma Xinfu's injuries were examined by a forensic doctor at the hospital. Although the injuries were severe, the bullet had been removed by the hospital and his life may be saved. The case was investigated by the water police second district detective chief, who discovered that Ma Shengrong was the murderer (Shengrong is Xinfu's nephew. When Xinfu entered the hospital, Shengrong escorted him to the hospital and accompanied and served him). Cao Laosi of Shuangxi Town is an accomplice. The two were arrested and sent to the district headquarters for interrogation, and then transferred to the branch for interrogation. Transfer of Land and Acreage in the County: Jiaxing's land reports have long been completed separately. All 264 villages in the county have reported 1,302,902.98 mu of private land, 3,615.727 mu of public land, 1,200.2 mu of wasteland, 70 mu of mountain land, 1,833 mu of railway land, 48,702 mu of lakes, 4,885 mu of roads, and 2,490 mu of rivers, totaling 1,365,698.907 mu.

However, the above acreage and prices are based on reports from the owners or investigations by the village committees. Errors and omissions are expected. It is now learned that the county government, in addition to reporting to the Civil Affairs Department for record, plans to carefully plan and try out land surveys in accordance with the provincial land survey outline in order to ensure accuracy.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>Settlement of Stamp Inspection Case: Wang Rixin Rice Shop outside Ximen previously had a conflict with the Pingjia Stamp Tea Tax Bureau due to stamp inspection.

<p>Sugar Storage Tax Case Resolved: The Zhejiang Finance Department received a personal visit from Lin Qinxiang, chairman of the Ningbo General Chamber of Commerce, to the province to discuss the issue of the Ningbo Sugar Tax Bureau's supplementary tax on stored sugar imported before April, which had already been taxed, causing disputes among sugar merchants. The department has now ordered the Sugar Tax Bureau to instruct the Ningbo branch that this stored sugar must not be taxed again.</p>
<p>Implementation of Increased Tax on Ham and Salted Meat: The Zhejiang Province's tax rate for ham and salted meat has been revised by the Finance Department to (1) 15 cents for each ham, plus 7.5 cents for Zhejiang West Water Conservancy expenses for those passing through Zhejiang West; (2) 15 cents for every ten catties of salted meat, plus 7.5 cents for Zhejiang West Water Conservancy expenses for those passing through Zhejiang West. The department ordered all unified tax bureaus to implement it from June 1.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Gengyu and Tongkang Bankrupt: Gengyu, a large traditional bank in Ningbo Jiangxia, and Tongkang, a small traditional bank, went bankrupt yesterday because the major shareholder, He Gengxing, lost too much money in speculative trading and could not make up for it, so he absconded, causing the two banks to be implicated. Gengyu's total receipts and payments were about 800,000 yuan, and Tongkang's were about 300,000 yuan. It is said that the loans released in Shanghai are not included. In addition, three large banks, Ruifeng and Tongshen, and fourteen small banks, Tongtai and Baohe, were also affected due to their joint shareholder relationship. The financial community in the city was greatly panicked. The Money Trade Association convened an emergency meeting of managers of large and small banks at the Jianchuan Shipyard Money Trade Association at around 10:00 AM yesterday morning. For all large and small banks with a shareholder relationship with He Gengxing, the managers of each related bank, together with other shareholders, were responsible for making up the accounts owed by Gengyu and Tongkang. Accounts settled on the 5th were considered valid, and those settled on the 6th were rejected as invalid. For Gengyu and Tongkang, relationships with upstream banks were handled according to common practice.</p>
<p>Former Dinghai County Magistrate Sentenced for Extorting Confessions: Feng Zhongjun, the former Dinghai County Magistrate, and Xu Zhenbo, the former Dinghai Public Security Bureau Chief, held a welcoming festival in Baiquan Township on April 11, 1929. Feng Zhongjun ordered Xu Zhenbo to take the police to stop it. Zhang Ayong and others in Baiquan Township refused and injured the police, besieging Bureau Chief Xu Zhenbo, who fled to Xie Sheng shop to hide and reported to the county government by phone. Feng Zhongjun and others immediately led a detective team to rescue. That night, they arrested Zhang Ayong, Zhang Dehe, Yu Lianggan, Fei Dongsheng and other ten people. They were taken to the county the next day. That night, Feng Zhongjun and Xu Zhenbo interrogated Zhang Ayong and others at the Public Security Bureau. Zhang Ayong and others refused to admit that they had beaten the police. Feng Zhongjun and Xu Zhenbo ordered the police to use torture, first beating Zhang Ayong's palms and then hitting him with rattan canes. Zhang Ayong still refused to confess. Feng Zhongjun ordered the police to use the training exercise board to torture Zhang Dehe. Fei Dongsheng was also beaten on the palms. Min Riyi transferred the case to the county government. During the trial by adjudicator Zhu Zhaodan, Feng Zhongjun ordered the police to beat Zhang Ayong and Geng Lianggan with rattan canes. Afterwards, Zhang Ayong and others successively petitioned the Zhejiang Civil Affairs Department for review. The Civil Affairs Department sent a letter to the Chief Prosecutor of the Zhejiang High Court for investigation and transferred it to the Hang County District Court. Criminal Judge Chen requested Prosecutor Xu Tigan to come to court to perform his duties and summoned the defendants and victims to court for trial. Based on the victims' statements and the court's verification, it was confirmed that Feng Zhongjun, with a common intention, continuously used violence and coercion to obtain confessions, and was sentenced to one year and four months of imprisonment with a two-year suspended sentence in accordance with the law. Xu Zhenbo's trial was suspended.</p>

<h3>Letter from the Central Anti-Opium Committee</h3>
<p>Sir, regarding the case of the strange ship transporting soil from the east, before it was published by Reuters, our committee had repeatedly received confidential reports from Europe with details. We have formulated measures and telegraphed the relevant supervisory agencies to strictly investigate. Recently, I read the news (Anti-Opium Committee Investigates Soil Transporting Vessel) in the domestic news column of your newspaper on the 27th of this month. The information is slightly different from the facts. I am writing to you to request a correction to clarify the facts. Central Anti-Opium Committee, May 28th.</p>

<h3>Various Japanese Circles Commemorate the Martyrs of the May 30th Incident</h3>
<p>Grand Meeting at the Penglai Grand Theater in Nanshi</p>
<p>Public Memorial Service at the Fangjiaqiao Cemetery in Zhabei</p>
<p>Today is the fifth anniversary of the May 30th Massacre. The Preparatory Committee for the May Revolution Memorial Day of Various Japanese Circles in this city will hold a memorial meeting at the Penglai Grand Theater in Nanshi at 9:00 AM and a public memorial service at the May 30th Martyrs Cemetery in Fangjia Muqiao Bridge, Zhabei, at 10:30 AM. All levels of party headquarters, institutions, and organizations must send four representatives to participate to express their condolences. The Municipal Executive Committee and the party headquarters of various districts will also issue letters to the public and comrades, as follows:</p>
<p>Municipal Executive Committee's Letter to the Public: Revolutionary people, the most painful and humiliating May 30th Massacre anniversary is here again. When we recall that day five years ago, the gunshots of the old Zhabei Police Station on Nanjing Road, the blood and flesh, that tragic scene is still lingering in our minds, giving us a very deep lesson. From then on, we have all recognized the hideous face of imperialism. After the Shanghai Massacre, people in various places rose up to fight, and British imperialism, disregarding humanity, carried out massacres. The same tragic incidents occurred in Nanjing, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Jiujiang, and other places. This action is enough to prove the imminent collapse of the imperialists, because the imperialists are very anxious when they see the Chinese people becoming aware. In this panicked situation, they do not choose methods or consider public morals and humanity, but only use the massacre policy to maintain their remaining breath. But in fact, our national revolution movement was oppressed by this evil force, but as a result, it has progressed day by day. Therefore, when we commemorate the May 30th Massacre, we must work hard to overthrow imperialism, recover concessions, abolish unequal treaties, and at the same time, continue the spirit of the May 30th martyrs, eliminate the Communist Party that betrays the nation, eradicate the warlords of Yan Feng, who harm the country and the people, support the central government, and complete the revolutionary China. Chinese Kuomintang Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee</p>
<p>Municipal Executive Committee's Letter to Comrades: Comrades of the whole city, the May 30th Massacre is now five years ago. For five years, our comrades have been living in pain and humiliation every day, and have been trying to avenge the dead compatriots. The bullets of imperialism, our flesh and blood, were born for the revolution and died for the revolution. Our comrades will never forget. However, why can we only commemorate it once a year and not avenge it? This is what we should introspect to pursue the root cause. After May 30th, the people's understanding of national humiliation is not limited to one corner. From Beiping all the way to Guangdong, from Shanghai all the way to Sichuan and Yunnan, from big cities all the way to small villages, there is no place that does not know about May 30th. In the past, only one class participated in the revolution, but the May 30th Movement had merchants, students, workers, and farmers at the same time. This movement also realized a kind of organized alliance of people from all walks of life. In the past, Chinese people simply did not know what imperialism was, so there was only blind xenophobia. After May 30th, the slogan of anti-imperialism became concrete demands such as abolishing consular jurisdiction, withdrawing the Chinese Navy and Marine Corps, recovering concessions, recovering the Joint Court, and opposing the construction of roads beyond the boundary. This kind of clear goal can be regarded as a product after May 30th. At this time, if we can work hard to rejuvenate ourselves, the liberation of the nation is just around the corner. However, the Beiping puppet government is high above, on the one hand, recognizing thieves as fathers and colluding with imperialists at all costs, and at the same time, oppressing the people and recklessly destroying the vigorous patriotic movement of the people. After the success of the Northern Expedition, although the Beiping puppet government fell with the decline of the warlords, the rebellion of the Gui faction and the current rebellion of Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan followed one after another, making it impossible for the revolutionary central government to fight the imperialists with all its strength. The chaos of the Communist Party made the social order precarious, so that the central authorities devoted all their efforts to the domestic relief. The reason why national humiliation cannot be avenged lies in this. Therefore, if the warlords and the Communist Party are not eliminated one day, imperialism cannot be overthrown, and the country cannot survive one day. For the current plan, revolutionary comrades should recognize the relationship of the entire society and work hard on the following tasks to comfort the dead martyrs: Follow the party's program and urge the diplomatic authorities to work hard to abolish unequal treaties, use the power of the people to recover concessions to overthrow imperialist cases, improve the factory system, improve the lives of farmers, such as expanding production power and equalizing consumption and distribution to solve the unemployment problem in cities and the economic collapse in rural areas, improve the lives of laborers, so that the Communist Party loses its opportunity to promote incitement. Especially for the current final rebellion of the two warlords, Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan, our comrades should, on the one hand, publicize the crimes and inevitable collapse of the two warlords Feng and Yan, and at the same time, train the people so that they will not be misled by reactionary rumors, support the central government so that the national revolution can be completed and the unified situation can be completed as soon as possible. We must know that only by defeating the two warlords Feng and Yan can peace and unity be realized, and only after the realization of peace and unity can we concentrate our strength and make a final decision with the imperialists. Dear comrades, remember, the guns of the imperialists will never conquer our own self-confidence. The national revival and glory will emit a ten-thousand-zhang light with our unanimous unity. Work hard, dear comrades, Chinese Kuomintang Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee</p>
<h3>Public Memorial Text of the Cemetery Board of Directors</h3>
<p>The Cemetery Board of Directors of May 30th will hold a public memorial service at the Fangjia Muqiao Bridge Cemetery in Zhabei at 9:00 AM today. The memorial text has been drafted, saying that on May 13th of the 19th year of the Republic of China, for the fifth anniversary of the May 30th Massacre, the Chairman of the Cemetery Board of Directors, Yu Qiaqing and Wang Xiaolai, and all the directors solemnly offer flowers and clear water to the spirits of the May 30th Martyrs. Alas, the martyrs went to the disaster for national rights and people's lives. It is the meaning of the gentleman not forgetting to lose his yuan. The martyrs went to justice for equality and freedom. It is the courage to not care about life and death. Death is either heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather. Death for private purposes may gain mourning, but its glory will not last long. Death for public purposes may not gain mourning, but death will last longer and its glory will be more obvious and eternal. The martyrs died for public purposes, not for private purposes. When they died, their bodies were brutally borrowed and gradually obtained a floating burial. Now the cemetery is magnificent and will surely exist forever in the north of Shanghai. The so-called lasting fame for generations? I still hope to enjoy it.</p>
<p>Family Members Association Will Go to the Cemetery for Public Memorial Today: The Shanghai May 30th Massacre Victims Family Members Association is organized by the families of the 25 May 30th martyrs and the comrades who were injured on May 30th. The association commemorates the martyrs' sacrifice for the country and their struggle for the nation. Their spirit of martyrdom is extremely tragic and sad. It is specifically determined to go to the May 30th Martyrs Cemetery at the end of Beibao Xing Road, Fangjia Muqiao Bridge, Zhabei at 10:00 AM today for a public memorial service. Everything has been prepared yesterday and wreaths have been purchased for today's memorial.</p>
<h3>Increased Defense Today</h3>
<p>Today, the Chinese community is commemorating the May 30th Massacre. The military and police agencies in this city have strengthened the defense of the north and south cities since yesterday. The Municipal Public Security Bureau has sent police to inspect pedestrians at the Zhabei Xinzha Bridge and the Fangbang Bridge tram station in Nanshi during the day. Even those taking street charter cars must be stopped and searched appropriately. Yesterday, the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent a letter to each branch, saying that for the sake of strictly maintaining public order, double posts will be set up at all the main traffic routes today.</p>
<p>The Public Concession's Bureau of Public Works Police Department issued a special order to all subordinate police stations yesterday, ordering them to increase the number of detectives in their respective jurisdictions for careful patrols, and especially to focus on the middle section of Nanjing Road, the source of the massacre. The Old Zhabei Police Station will add temporary posts in the Nanjing Road area from this morning to prevent them.</p>
<p>The authorities of the French Concession Police Station issued an order to all police stations yesterday, ordering all detectives to gather at the police station. They will all be on duty from 7:00 AM this morning. The iron fences at the junction of the Chinese and French Concessions will be closed as appropriate. All entertainment venues (such as the Great World and various cinemas) in the concession will be closed for one day.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Soared Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Highest 536 and a half taels</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies were strong and there were many people who wanted to buy US dollars and pounds, but there were few sellers, so the general acceptance of silver prices gradually fell, and the bank's US dollar selling price opened to 340 Mexican dollars per 100 US dollars, which was unprecedented. The opening price of HSBC gold standard was 8 pence and 375 thousandths of a pound and 41.25 US dollars. At that time, there were many buyers and no sellers. Afterwards, due to no transactions, the disk price changed little. The opening price of gold standard was 528 taels and eight qian, the closing price at noon was 534 taels and six qian, and the opening price in the afternoon was as high as 536 taels and five qian, and closed at 530 taels and six qian.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Executive Committee Telegraphed the Whole Country to Strictly Prevent Cultural Aggression</h3>
<p>Seven measures decided</p>
<p>Hope for unanimous advocacy</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee telegraphed the whole country yesterday to prevent the cultural aggression of imperialism, please advocate unanimously. The telegram said to all newspapers and periodicals to forward it to all levels of party headquarters, mass organizations, government agencies, and schools across the country. Cultural aggression is the vanguard of imperialism's aggression against China. It hinders the development of our nation and harms the survival of our nation. It is far more serious than political aggression and economic aggression. The Committee has decided on seven measures in view of this, as a remedy after losing the sheep. First, non-citizens of the Republic of China or organizations not entirely composed of citizens of the Republic of China shall not establish elementary schools, kindergartens, or normal schools for educating Chinese people. All teachers and staff of elementary schools or kindergartens shall be limited to citizens of the Republic of China. Second, from the 19th year onwards, graduates of church schools that have not been approved by Chinese government agencies shall not receive the same treatment as graduates of registered schools. Church schools that set up religious subjects or hold religious ceremonies on campus shall not be allowed to register. All church schools that have been rejected for registration or have not applied for registration within the deadline shall be ordered to close. Third, church schools that apply for registration shall be investigated in detail by the Provincial Education Department or the Municipal and County Education Bureaus. After being transferred and approved for registration, the original investigating agency shall be responsible for inspecting at any time whether there are any private religious propaganda activities. If there are any violations of regulations, they shall be dealt with at any time. For church schools that have been approved for registration, the principal shall be directly appointed by the Chinese government agency in charge, but the board of directors shall have the power of supervision. If the principal is not competent, the board of directors shall be allowed to apply to the Chinese government agency in charge for investigation and another appointment. Fourth, all religious organizations shall not use the names of preaching halls and seminaries to gather Chinese children to teach religious subjects. If they are actually organizations that study religion, they shall not be allowed to participate by underage citizens of the Republic of China. Violators shall be closed down immediately. Fifth, although the YMCA in various parts of the country ostensibly promotes the four educations of morality, intelligence, physical fitness, and group, in fact, it promotes Christian doctrines and tempts young people. It is obviously a cultural aggression agency of imperialists and should be taken over and managed by Chinese educational institutions. Sixth, all organizations with religious characteristics must be organized in accordance with the organizational plan of people's organizations promulgated by the Party Central Committee. All publications published by church schools or organizations shall be submitted to the local highest party headquarters for review on a regular basis. Seventh, foreigners who take the opportunity to investigate culture and go to China's national territory to develop antiquities without authorization shall be deported in addition to confiscating all their possessions. I hope that we can advocate unanimously to curb the evil flames of imperialism and save the sovereignty of the Republic of China. Chinese Kuomintang Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee</p>

<h3>Money Trade Agrees on Summer and Autumn Festival Days</h3>
<p>Closed for one day each on the 1st and 11th of June</p>
<p>The money trade market at the entrance of Longqing Lane, Ningbo Road, holds gatherings twice a day, morning and afternoon, to conduct transactions and evaluate market prices. It only takes one hour before the market closes. Yesterday morning at 8 o'clock, the gathering proceeded as usual, but even at 11 o'clock at noon, the noise was still deafening and the market had not dispersed. Traditionally, the money trade only closes for a few days a year, such as the Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, Double Tenth, Gregorian New Year's Day, and Lunar New Year's Day. Even on weekly holidays or customs closures, business is not suspended. This year, the committee announced that it would follow the orders of the National Government and switch to the Gregorian calendar, meaning that the abolished festivals of custom and tradition are all subject to elimination. All employees of the money trade believed that since the money trade does not stop on Sundays, the abolished festivals should still be days of rest. They requested the money trade committee to allow them to take a day off on June 1st (i.e., the lunar Dragon Boat Festival) as usual, otherwise, all employees would go on strike this morning to achieve their goal. Therefore, all employees in the market did not disperse and did not conduct any transactions. After the committee learned of this, it sent representative Xie Taofu to mediate, but this only provoked the anger of the employees. The situation was very tense for a time, and the market had not dispersed even at 11 o'clock at noon. Later, Jiang, an employee of the Shanghai Bank, took on the responsibility of a peacemaker and promised to communicate with the committee on behalf of the employees to achieve their goal. At 3 PM, the Money Trade Association immediately convened an emergency meeting of the executive committee. It was resolved that from now on, June 1st and October 1st each year would be designated as summer and autumn festival days, and would be closed for one day each. The abolished festivals of the Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival would be eliminated.</p>

<h3>Chen Shaokuan and Others Will Attend the International Disarmament and Security Conference</h3>
<p>The International Disarmament and Security Committee is scheduled to meet in Germany. It sent a prior telegram inviting our country to send representatives to attend. The National Government immediately appointed Chiang Tso-pin, Minister to Germany, Chen Shaokuan, Vice Minister of the Navy, Zhang Jingyu, Aviation Association, and Huang Musong, Military Officer School, as representatives to attend. Of the representatives, only Chiang Tso-pin is in Germany. The rest are constrained by official duties and have no time to depart. Because the meeting date is near, Minister to Germany Chiang Tso-pin specifically telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, asking Chen, Zhang, and Huang to come to Europe quickly to attend so that they can discuss the proposals to be submitted to the conference by our country. It is now learned that the National Government has approved the plan for Chen Shaokuan and others to pack their bags and set off for Europe immediately. At the same time, it ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to handle passport matters on their behalf. The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has consulted with the German consulate in Shanghai on matters related to Chen and others leaving the country. Director Chen has already consulted with the German consulate in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Talking About the Internal Reorganization of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau is more complex than inland telephone bureaus in terms of both Chinese and foreign affairs. Since Zhao Chuanyu's reorganization, the improvement of telephone sets, the strict management, and the speed of connection have all been carried out in an orderly manner with remarkable results. The recent two weeks of internal management reorganization are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Abolishing Office Staff: The Shanghai Telephone Bureau, due to the vastness of its jurisdiction, has its main bureau in South City, Zhonghua Road, while two branch bureaus are established in Zhabei. Jiangwan, Wusong, and Longhua also have their own branch bureaus with two or three hundred telephone numbers each. In addition to drivers and foremen, each department has an office worker in each of the main and branch bureaus who specializes in managing branch bureau affairs and recording Chinese and foreign telephone interconnections and accounts. Zhao has now completely replaced almost all personnel in the bureau, from department heads to tea servants. It is said that only six of all employees have retained their positions, and the rest have been replaced with new people. Director Zhao, in order to save expenses, ordered the complete abolition of office workers in the five branch bureaus, which can save three or four hundred yuan per month. The duties left behind are concurrently performed by the deputy foremen, which has already been implemented.</p>
<p>Promoting Women's Livelihood: Zhao believes that women's employment should be promoted and that women are often more careful and cautious in managing affairs than male employees. Therefore, all department heads of the cashier department in the main bureau are women, and female employees are also added to other document departments. Furthermore, due to the increasing number of Chinese and foreign telephone calls interconnected with the concession every day in the main and branch bureaus, a batch of female office workers has been specially added to specialize in recording, accounting, and verifying the number of Chinese and foreign telephone calls. If female office work can achieve excellent results, it is decided to add more in the future.</p>
<p>Establishing a Driver School: Now, there are more and more female switchboard operators in the five bureaus, already numbering one hundred and several tens. Director Zhao believes that female operators have the possibility of being promoted to regular and deputy foremen, and must have a considerable degree of English, mathematics, and Chinese. Therefore, in order to train female operators in the bureau in advanced academic skills, a large building has been rented opposite the main bureau on Zhonghua Road to establish a school. Teachers are concurrently held by staff members of various departments in the bureau, specializing in training off-duty female operators. It is currently being decorated and will open soon to teach classes.</p>
<p>Establishing Clubs in Various Departments: Zhao had already set up a club for switchboard operators in the Suzhou bureau and formed a football team (because Suzhou has male operators) for proper leisure after work. After taking over the main bureau in South City, Zhao has already established a club, divided into music, reading, and ball-playing activities. Because the bureau site on Gonghe Xin Road in the Zhabei branch bureau is about to be completed, Zhao personally inspected it yesterday and instructed the layout of the club. Other bureaus such as Jiangwan and Wusong are also increasing their efforts to ensure that the lives of telephone operators are not monotonous.</p>
<p>Saving Various Extraneous Expenses: Although the business of the Shanghai bureau is developed, the expenses of each bureau are too large, making it difficult to have a surplus. The most important thing is the cost of materials. Because electrical materials are all purchased from abroad, after the gold price rose, the goods all followed suit and rose in price. In order to gradually achieve a surplus in revenue and expenditure, Director Zhao first reduced the various expenses of the main and branch bureaus. For example, the electric lights used by each bureau, which used to be 32-candlepower lights, are now limited to 10-candlepower lights. Other non-urgent expenses are also reduced.</p>

<h3>Patrolman Donations Should Be Based on Rent</h3>
<p>Taxpayer Association Responds to Lawyer Qian's Letter</p>
<p>Lawyer Qian Chengxu stated that the Dalong Iron Factory rents the house at No. 2 Dalian Bay and pays patrolman donations according to the rent on the house ticket every month. The Public Works Department then notified that the house price was too low and needed to be one-third higher. Lawyer Qian then sent a letter to the Shanghai Concession Taxpayer Association asking two questions: (1) Is the payment of patrolman donations in the concession based on the house ticket? (2) If the rent is low due to the friendly relations between the two parties and the landlord is willing to accept less, does the Public Works Department Committee have the right to set a price to increase the patrolman donations and cancel the effect of the house ticket? The Shanghai Concession Taxpayer Association specially replied yesterday: In response to the letter of May 28, asking whether the patrolman donations of the Public Works Department are based on the actual rent or the estimated price, it is found that the calculation of patrolman donations should be based on the actual rent (i.e., what is recorded on the house ticket) and cannot be calculated based on the estimated price. There have been two cases due to disputes over the calculation, and the results were handled in this way. Correspondingly, please check.</p>
<h3>The Public Discussion of Silk Trade in Prefecture is about Carefully Releasing Funds</h3>
<p>Every time the mountain cocoons in Henan Province are on the market, the silk industry in this prefecture must remit funds to the silk shops in various counties (with Nanyang and Xuzhou as the main hubs) to respond to the weaving households purchasing silk cocoons for future delivery and settlement. The amount must be three or four million. At this time, the time to release funds is during the war. If the method of previous years is followed, it is feared that, as in the previous few years, the weaving households will escape due to the impact of the war, resulting in losses of more than one million, causing certain shops to close down due to losses. Not releasing the funds will have a great impact on the future of the business. Therefore, the association discussed countermeasures yesterday afternoon. It was generally believed that the war could be remedied if it could be resolved as soon as possible. At present, the release of funds is mainly cautious in order to avoid repeating the mistakes of previous years.</p>

<p>A Huge Amount of Military Supplies was Found by the Pudong Customs in the Chaqi Port</p>
<p>Mr. Wang is Truly Omnipotent</p>
<p>Military Supplies were Removed from the Customs</p>
<p>Eight Gunny Sacks of Pistols and Bullets were Seized</p>
<p>Thirteen More Boxes were Secretly Shipped Out</p>
<p>They were Privately Smuggled into Shanghai by a German Ship</p>
<p>Five Relevant Persons have been Detained One After Another</p>
<p>At about 11:00 last night, Chinese detectives from the Water Police Station searched a ship in the Chaqi Port of the Pudong Customs and seized a large number of guns and bullets. Five relevant persons were detained one after another, along with two wooden boats, and taken to the police station for interrogation. The details are divided as follows:</p>
<p>Pistols and Bullets Pile Up: The Pudong Lujiazui Water Police Station has been dispatching armed Chinese detectives on gasoline boats to patrol the Huangpu River from time to time in order to protect the water. The police station dispatched Chinese detectives Huang Zhenlin, Ge Changsheng, Cheng Yongnian, and Sun Agui, together with Chinese police officers Wang Songsan and Huang Songsheng, and Western police officers, all armed, to patrol by boat again last night. At 11:20 PM, while passing through the Chaqi Port of the Lujiazui Customs in Pudong, they shone a flashlight inside and saw a pier boat parked in the port. A person on it was looking around suspiciously. They immediately drove the boat into the port and parked it next to the pier boat. The detectives got on the boat to interrogate the person standing on the boat, but the person gave evasive answers and seemed very flustered. The detectives immediately moved the cabin floorboards. The cabin was empty. The detectives, fearing that there were mechanisms, opened the mezzanine floorboards and saw several burlap sacks inside. They took the burlap sacks together and found that there were eight sacks in total. The sacks were unusually heavy. They examined them one by one and found that they were all guns, bullets, and other military supplies. The number was very large. They immediately took the people and boats along with the loot to the police station. After the police station personnel checked the seized military supplies one by one, they found a total of 135 No. 32 pistols, 21,380 pistol bullets, 57 bullet shells, and 41 wooden shells.</p>
<p>Removed from Inside the Customs: The police chief He Dafu ordered the detained persons to be brought to the case for preliminary interrogation. According to the interrogation, the person's name is Liang Caiyou, also known as Liang Sannian, 48 years old, from Yancheng, and he is a boat rocker. On the 14th of this month, a stranger named Wang hired my boat to load goods in Pudong. I saw that there was business, so I rocked the boat to the location designated by Wang in the Chaqi Port of the Lujiazui Customs in Pudong and parked there. At 2 PM that afternoon, Wang removed Mauser guns and bullets, etc., a total of thirteen boxes, from the customs warehouse and loaded them onto my boat, which was hidden in the boat. The boat stayed in the port for three days. On the 16th, following Wang's instructions, I untied the cable and rocked the boat to the south side of the Sichuan Road Bridge in Suzhou Creek and parked it. At 11 PM that night, one of Zhu Xiaosanzi's empty pier boats, hired by Wang, came to transfer three boxes of military supplies to the empty boat and transport them away. On the evening of the 17th, Xiaosanzi's boat came again to transfer two boxes of military supplies. There were eight boxes left on the boat. The boat was parked in Suzhou Creek for nine days. On the morning of the 25th, Wang suddenly called me from the Sichuan Road Bridge and told me to rock the boat to the side of the manure pier in the Chaqi Port of the Pudong Customs. On the afternoon of the 27th, I changed the boat to the side of the customs warehouse pier. On the evening of the 28th (i.e., the day before), Zhu Xiaosanzi sent eight burlap sacks, all of which were military supplies, which were divided and hidden in the mezzanine floorboards of the cabin. After Zhu and others left, they were seized, etc. According to the interrogation, the police chief sentenced Liang to be detained in the detention center for further interrogation.</p>
<p>Three People were Apprehended at Chaqi Port: Police Chief He, considering the importance of the case and that there were clues to follow, ordered the detectives to take a boat back to the Chaqi Port to wait. Before long (at about 3 AM), a pier boat came rocking from outside to the port and was about to rock into the port when the detectives ordered the boat to stop. The detectives searched the boat cabin and found two empty wicker clips. They immediately stopped the three people on the boat and took them to the police station. After the police chief interrogated the three one by one, one confessed that his name was Zhu Xiaosanzi, 31 years old, from Yancheng, and he was a boat rocker. I worked as the boss on Wang's boat for about a month, with a monthly salary of fifteen yuan. Two weeks ago, at 4 PM, my boat was parked at the customs warehouse pier in the Chaqi Port of the Pudong Customs. At that time, Wang called me to load four boxes of bullets. I saw the coolies in the warehouse carrying the bullets down and loaded them. I immediately rocked the boat to the Hongkou port outside the Hongqiao and parked it. The next day at about 7 AM, Wang hired a car to transport the bullets, etc., away. Three days later, my boat returned to Chaqi Port. Then, at about 11 PM that night, Wang called me to transfer three boxes of military supplies from Liang San (i.e., Liang Caiyou)'s boat and rocked them to the Yangsongban Pier north of the Xinzha Bridge in Suzhou Creek. Wang hired a car to load the three boxes of military supplies away. After another two or three days, Wang called me to rock the boat from the Chaqi Port to Liang San's boat under the Sichuan Road Bridge in Suzhou Creek to transfer two boxes of military supplies. I still rocked them to the north bank of the Xinzha Bridge and Wang hired a car to load them away. On the afternoon of the 27th of this month, Wang told me to rock the boat to the outer barrier of the German ship at the Gonghexiang Pier in Hongkou and park at the four bridges. On the 28th (i.e., the day before), at 3 AM, the ship unloaded eight burlap sacks of military supplies. After the matter was completed, they were transported to the Chaqi Port in Pudong. At 6 PM that afternoon, eight sacks of military supplies were transferred to Liang San's boat and secretly hidden. At 10 PM that night, one box of bullets was transported from Liang San's boat to the north bank of the Xinzha Bridge in Suzhou Creek and handed over to Wang's hired car. When I came back, I parked at the Dongyang Company Pier in Hongkou. On the 29th (i.e., yesterday) morning, Wang sent two empty wicker clips and told me to drive the boat back to Chaqi Port and park it with Liang San's boat. Unexpectedly, as soon as I entered the port, I was arrested, etc. The police chief also questioned the other two, one named Wang Xiaoxizi, 31 years old, from Yancheng, and the other named Xiao Wansan, 36 years old, from Yancheng. They both confessed to being partners on Zhu Xiaosanzi's boat. The rest was roughly the same as Zhu's confession.</p>
<p>Wang Guangyu was Subsequently Detained: After reviewing the case, the police chief found inconsistencies in the confessions of Zhu and Liang. He urgently needed to apprehend and interrogate Wang, who was mentioned in the confession. When Liang Caiyou was brought forward again for interrogation, he asked where Wang lived, and Liang replied that he did not know, but he could ask the customs warehouse personnel. The police chief ordered detectives to bring Wu Linsheng, the head of the customs warehouse coolies, to the case. Wu said that Wang's name was Guangyu and he lived at No. 55 Heqing Lane, Shanhai Pass Road. After dawn, the police chief still ordered the original detectives to go to the address and arrest Wang and escort him to the Xinzha Police Station. After a brief trial by the Special Zone District Court, he was handed over to the original detectives to be taken back to the Water Police Station. After the police chief interrogated him, Wang confessed that his name was Guangyu, 34 years old, from Anhui. He worked as a broker at the German Tianlai Company at No. 22 Boyuan Road. Therefore, he often went to the customs warehouse in Lujiazui, Pudong, to deposit and withdraw goods. Therefore, the personnel in the customs and the boat rockers all knew each other well. I did not know anything about the large amount of guns and bullets that were seized and had nothing to do with me. I am afraid that there is another person named Wang who handled the matter and mistakenly identified me as the handler. I was mistakenly detained, etc. The police chief, considering the importance of the case, did not dare to act arbitrarily and ordered Wang to sit in the writing room to await instructions.</p>
<p>The Police Station Paid Serious Attention: After the case was cracked, the police chief ordered the two pier boats that had been apprehended to be impounded together with the police station. The eight burlap sacks of guns and bullets that were seized were also escorted to the Jianghai Customs by detectives dispatched by the police chief yesterday. However, Police Chief He believes that the source of the large number of bullets, according to the confession of Zhu Xiaosanzi and others, was transported from a German ship. Since there was no passport, no matter where they were transported from, they were all smuggled. Moreover, before the seizure of the eight burlap sacks of military supplies, thirteen boxes of bullets were removed from the customs warehouse by Wang. It is not known what kind of procedures were used to remove them from the customs, although the customs warehouse personnel were also surprised when asked. It is also unclear where and what kind of use they were intended for after they were shipped out. Moreover, the amount was so large that it was shocking. Therefore, the police chief believes that it is necessary to investigate all of the above situations. As for Liang Caiyou, Zhu Xiaosanzi, Wang Xiaoxizi, Xiao Wansan, Wang Guangyu, and the other five who were apprehended one after another, they were all detained in the police station yesterday to await interrogation by the District Court today.</p>

<p>Plus, a Large Quantity of Gold Jewelry Demanded</p>
<p>It was reported yesterday that a large band of pirates had attacked and looted seven sand ships off the coast of Sheshan Port outside Wusong. It has now been learned that, except for the Gao Changmao and Fu Changmao, the remaining five ships were redeemed by their owners after they prepared the ransom money. However, at approximately 5 AM yesterday, seven Shandong sand ships, including the Ding Dexing, Jin Zengxiang, Jin Lisheng, Ye Tongsheng, Jin Fusheng, Xu Fuyuan, and Huang Changxing, were also robbed by the same group of pirates in the Sheshan Hong Port area. Together with the Gao Changmao and Fu Changmao, which were robbed earlier and not yet redeemed, they were forced to sail to the vicinity of Haimen, Ningbo, and anchored at the foot of the mountain. At that time, eleven crew members were released and sent to Shanghai to report the incident and demand a ransom. The bandit leader, Xu Jinlong, issued a detailed ransom note and handed it to the crew members to bring back. The note demanded a total of 51,000 yuan for the ships and the 24 hostages on board. In addition, they demanded 70 gold rings, each weighing four mace, six gold bracelets, each weighing six taels, and six gold chains, each weighing two taels or more. All items must be prepared within one week and taken to the mountain fortress for redemption before the hostages will be released.</p>
<h3>Movie Star Commits Suicide in Central Hotel</h3>
<p>Unable to Survive the Upcoming Dragon Boat Festival</p>
<p>Suicide in Hotel Leads to Dangerous Situation</p>
<p>A young traveler checked into room 625 of the Central Hotel on Zhengfeng Street, Wuma Road, on the day before yesterday at noon. He registered under the name Zheng Yingfei, age 20, from Huzhou, working in the film industry. After closing the room, he went out and returned late at night, showing no unusual behavior. However, at approximately 7 PM yesterday afternoon, a loud "ouch" sound was heard from the room. The hotel staff, knowing something was wrong, pried open the door and found Zheng Yingfei barely breathing with a packet of raw opium beside him. Knowing that he had taken poison, the staff of room 88 reported the incident to the Lao Zha station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. No suicide note was found. He was immediately sent to the Xizang Road Epidemic Hospital for treatment. It is said that the poison was potent, and his life may be in danger. According to an investigation by reporters with his friends, Zheng Yingfei was once a movie star in a certain film company and also worked as a staff member at the Empire Theatre in the French Concession's Baxianqiao. This suicide is believed to be due to the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival. Because of his usual romantic lifestyle, he accumulated heavy debts and could not overcome this difficult situation, so he resorted to this desperate measure.</p>
<h3>Madman Fears Police and Falls into Huangpu River</h3>

<p>Duty Police Investigate Zhou Maomao</p>
<p>Zhou Fugen, age 16, the son of Zhou Maomao, a villager from Nanxiang, Laobaidu, Pudong, suffers from mental illness and often causes trouble outside, which his parents cannot control. The afternoon before last, at 3 PM, he went to the Tongchunfu Foreign Firm Pier. Seeing women washing clothes on the water bridge, Fugen went to tease and harass them. A patrolman noticed and tried to drive him away. Unexpectedly, Zhou Fugen feared the police like a tiger. As soon as he saw the police coming, he jumped onto a boat in the river. Turning around and seeing that the patrolman had not left, he tried to escape again, causing him to lose his footing and fall into the river. He was immediately rescued, but it was not until yesterday morning that he was found, already drowned. The First Section of the Third District investigated and summoned his father, Zhou Maomao, to the station for questioning.

<h3>Sick Woman Dies Halfway</h3>
<p>Rogue Lang Qing Abandons Her After Seduction</p>
<p>Friend A'fu Carries Dead Body and Attempts to Abandon it</p>
<p>An old woman named Cao Zhangshi, residing at number 33 Caiyang Lane outside Xiaonanmen in Chuansha, had a daughter, Gan Cao, who married a local man, Gansheng Ru, at the age of seventeen, now 22 years old. The couple originally lived on Sangyuan Street. However, Gansheng Ru suddenly left home three years ago, abandoning his wife. Gan Cao had no choice but to live with her husband's sister in Lujiabang. She was also disliked by her aunt, making it impossible to live peacefully. She had to return to Ning, but her mother, Cao Zhangshi, was a poor vegetable seller who could not support her daughter. Therefore, she recommended her as a tea-picking worker to earn a living. This year, a rogue named Lang Qing saw the young woman and began to seduce her. Because her husband had been unfaithful and left, and she had no means of support, Gan Cao was swayed by Lang Qing and began an illicit relationship. On April 20th of this year, Lang Qing took her away and hid her in the Shuxing Inn on Qianxin Street in the French Concession. At first, they lived in bliss, but Lang was an unemployed vagrant and could not afford the expenses, leading to a lack of food and clothing. Gan Cao became weak and ill, and without money for treatment, she became emaciated. Yesterday morning, when she was barely breathing, Lang, fearing involvement with the authorities, discussed the matter with his accomplices, Fang A'fu and A'yue. They hired a rickshaw from Hongguo and had Fang A'fu carry her onto the rickshaw, with Lang and others following behind, to send her back to Cao Zhangshi's home, hoping to absolve themselves of responsibility. However, when they reached the vicinity of Xiaonanmen, Gan Cao's body slumped onto the footboard. The rickshaw driver felt the increased weight and realized she was dead. Lang and the others ordered the rickshaw to Caiyang Lane. While the driver was turning the rickshaw, Lang and others took the opportunity to escape, leaving only Fang A'fu holding a dead person in the rickshaw. When Cao Zhangshi saw that her daughter was dead, she refused to accept the body and questioned Fang A'fu about what had happened. Fang, in great panic, revealed the truth. Cao Zhangshi ordered the rickshaw to return to the original place to look for Lang Qing and the others, but they were not found until they reached Fuyoumen. The police saw them and detained them at the Second Section of the First District. The case involved a human life, and the two parties and the corpse were transferred to the local court for investigation. Prosecutor Li ordered the body to be taken to the autopsy room. The autopsy confirmed that she had died of tuberculosis and ordered the family to collect the body for burial. Her mother immediately claimed she could not afford a coffin. The court then ordered the Baozhang to report to the hall for collection and burial.</p>
<h3>Memoir of a Dancer Losing Her Virginity</h3>
<p>Yan Xiangguan Accused of Enticement</p>
<p>Demanding 30,000 Yuan for Support</p>
<p>Through the Mediation of Relatives and Friends</p>
<p>Yan Paid 2,000 Yuan to Settle the Matter</p>
<p>Yan Xiangyi, residing in the Fu Li on Ai'erjin Road, is the son of the wealthy Ningbo merchant Yan Kangmao. Recently, Ye Sanmei, a Cantonese dancer from the Yuegong Dance Hall on North Sichuan Road, and her sister Zhang Ye filed a criminal complaint with the Special District Local Court, accusing him of enticement. According to the original complaint, Yan Xiangguan frequented the Yuegong Dance Hall and met Sanmei. The dancer, at the prime age of 19, had a beautiful appearance that pleased Xiangguan. On January 4th of this year, Sanmei was enticed by him to board the Ningxing steamer to Ningbo. On the boat, he used sweet words, saying that he would definitely marry Sanmei after arriving in Ningbo. Upon reaching his hometown, Xiangguan hid her in a separate room and repeatedly raped her for three months. She was completely deprived of her freedom. It was not until a certain day in April that she found a gap and escaped back to Shanghai alone to seek help from her sister. She originally intended to commit suicide, but her sister repeatedly persuaded her to endure the humiliation and live on. Later, she learned that Xiangguan was already married and that he had designed to entice and rape a young girl. She was deeply wronged and filed a complaint, requesting punishment under Articles 244 and 257 of the criminal law, and filed an accompanying private prosecution requesting the payment of 30,000 yuan for support to maintain her livelihood. The defendant, Yan Xiangguan, also hired lawyer Yuan Hanyun to submit a defense statement. The court originally scheduled a hearing yesterday afternoon. However, through the mediation of relatives and friends from both sides, Yan gave the dancer 2,000 yuan to settle the matter. The plaintiff's lawyer then filed a request to withdraw the complaint, which was approved by Judge Sun.</p>
<h3>Prohibiting Car Horns Between Midnight and Early Morning</h3>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, regarding the ban on indiscriminate car horn use to reduce noise pollution in the city, reliable sources say that the French Concession Police are willing to cooperate with the Public Concession Police and have provisionally decided to adopt the methods proposed by the Public Concession Police.

<h3>Businesses in the Public Concession Accused of Not Affixing Stamp Duty</h3>
<p>Each Fined 20 Yuan</p>
<p>Businesses in the Public Concession are required to affix stamp duty to their account books and invoices, as repeatedly announced by the Concession Court and the Stamp Duty Bureau. However, while many stores have purchased and affixed stamps to their account books, they regard various invoices as unimportant and do not purchase and affix stamp duty. The Stamp Duty Bureau believes that the businesses are outwardly compliant but inwardly defiant, which seriously hinders tax collection. Therefore, they sent personnel to inspect. Those who do not comply with the regulations will be investigated according to law. The inspections revealed that seven businesses, including Anlu Cotton Weaving Factory on Fujian Road, Zhongnan Socks Factory on Hubei Road, Nanyang Socks Factory on Guangdong Road, Zikang Foreign Goods Store on Hubei Road, Lulong Sheng Hardware Store on Changsha Road, Xin Zha, Yuchang Pawnshop on Henan Road, and Jinkang Pawnshop, had all failed to affix stamp duty. The relevant police stations were notified to verify the facts, and the police stations filed a public prosecution with the Special District Local Court. Yesterday morning, the court issued summons to the defendants. Xu Jinkang Pawnshop failed to appear and will be summoned again. The others appeared in court, each represented by their manager or representative. Judge Luo Renji questioned them one by one and, considering it was their first offense, leniently fined them 20 yuan each. The defendants paid the fines and were released. This is the first time that the Industrial Bureau has assisted the Stamp Duty Bureau in filing a public prosecution against businesses in the Concession for failing to affix Chinese government stamp duty. This shows that foreigners also know that stamp duty is indeed a good tax, and Chinese merchants cannot use the Concession as a shield to resist the Chinese government's tax laws. Therefore, they should request the court to impose sanctions to avoid emulation, which shows the ability of foreigners to respect our national laws.</p>
<h3>Li Li Shouts "Thief," Shot Dead</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 8:30 AM, four thieves broke into the home of Li Li, resident of 1107 Xinzha Road, Shanghai West. Three of the thieves were armed with handguns. At the time, Li's maid was getting up and heard someone knocking on the back door. When she opened the door to look, the three thieves rushed in. Li Li, who lived in the lower side room, heard the noise and came out to see what was happening. He saw that they were all strangers and immediately asked what they wanted. The thieves pointed their guns at him. Li, unafraid, shouted, "Thieves!" Seeing that things were going badly, the bandits fired a shot that hit Li in the left hip. Another shot entered his abdomen. Li, enduring the pain, still wanted to go upstairs, but he fell down on the stairs and died. Seeing the disaster, the thieves fled from the back door. Although Li's family suffered no losses, he died for his efforts. His family reported the incident to the police, who investigated and requested the arrest of the criminals. The body was taken to the autopsy room on Faelun Road for an autopsy tomorrow. It was learned that Li Li had previously served as a secretary to the magistrate of Nanhui County. His death by robbers' guns was also unexpected.</p>
<h3>600,000 Yuan Swindle Case Not Adjudicated Yesterday</h3>
<p>Further Debate Required</p>
<p>Yang Shulin, a Tianjin native formerly a patrol leader at the Zhabei Fourth District Police Station, used high interest rates as bait to absorb cash from greedy people and re-lend it to others, exploiting them for heavy profits. Over three to five years, he swindled more than 600,000 yuan. This time, various creditor firms discovered his secret and filed a complaint. The Special District Local Court brought Yang and his employee He Qiqing to trial. The court ordered He to be released on bail and Yang to be detained pending sentencing. The various details have been previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning was originally scheduled for the announcement of the verdict in this case. Male and female creditors arrived at the Third Criminal Court of the Special District Court at 9 AM to listen, and the audience was still very large. However, He Qiqing, who had previously been released on 1,000 yuan bail, did not appear. Judge Sun Yuan then took the bench and ordered Yang Shulin to be brought to the court. He immediately declared that the content of the case still needed to be studied further and that there was no time to announce the verdict today. Further debate was still necessary. He then ordered both parties to schedule a new debate for the afternoon of June 11th, and Yang Shulin was returned to the police station for detention.</p>

The captured bandits were handed over to the Special District Local Court for trial.

<h3>Dispute Over Cross-Border Vehicle Inspection</h3>
<p>Jiaotong University Professor Beaten</p>
<p>Western Police Chief Apologizes to Settle Matter</p>
<p>Haige Road in Shanghai West was built by foreigners beyond the concession boundary in the 24th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty. Xu Yan, the director of the Second Section of the Sixth District of the Xujiahui Town Public Security Bureau, considering that the loss of national sovereignty was due to the foreigners' overstepping and that the exercise of his official duties was greatly hindered, repeatedly negotiated with the foreigners through the authorities and set up the third and fifteenth posts on the southern end of the road for more than a year, and no incidents had occurred. However, on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (27th) at about 2 PM, two Chinese detectives from the French Concession, 497 and 96, were inspecting vehicle licenses in front of the Catholic Church garden on Haige Road at the southern end of Hongqiao Road. The rickshaw puller refused, and a conflict broke out between the two sides. The rickshaw puller A was beaten and kicked. At that time, Jiang Ruzhou, a professor at Jiaotong University from Haimen, passed by and tried to mediate and stated that the road belonged to the Chinese boundary and should not be inspected across the boundary. The two Chinese detectives, hearing this, roared and said that they were ordered to inspect and that who was he to stop them, so they abandoned the rickshaw puller and made things difficult for Jiang. They disagreed and were beaten on the head, face, and waist. As they were about to be taken to the police station, the onlookers gathered more and more people, all indignant. Many people wanted to make things difficult for the detectives, but they saw that the situation was not good and called for help. Xie Yongnian, the police officer on duty at the third post, heard the alarm and arrived, only to realize that the detectives were inspecting vehicle licenses and insulting the people at the junction, which was inappropriate. He planned to take the two Chinese detectives and Jiang Ruzhou back to the station, but the Chinese detectives fled back to the Concession. He copied the detectives' numbers and reported them to Director Xu for verification. Unexpectedly, after the Chinese detectives escaped, they arrested the rickshaw puller Liang Xiaotao at the junction of Betang Road and the Chinese Concession and violently beat him at the French Concession police station. Director Xu was informed and immediately sent patrol officer Xu Tao to the Shanzhong Road police station to negotiate. The Western police chief Malkam (transliteration) detained the two Chinese detectives involved and released the rickshaw puller Liang Xiaotao. He also guaranteed that there would never be a similar incident again. All losses and medical expenses of Mr. Jiang would be borne by the police station, and he expressed his apologies in person. Patrol Officer Xu reported the situation back to Director Xu and transferred it to Director Yuan for instructions. The injured Jiang Ruzhou was treated at the Xusheng Hospital on Xizang Road. Fortunately, the injury was not serious and he was discharged after bandaging. It is heard that the matter will not be expanded and will be resolved well.</p>

After the incident, the Signal Platoon reported it to the police station, which reported it to the Wusong Rescue Bureau. The Wusong Rescue Bureau sent a patrol boat to search for the body. It was not until about 10 AM yesterday that the soldier's body was recovered by the patrol boat at the mouth of the Yunzaobang River. A number 34 symbol was found on the soldier's uniform, proving that it was Yan's body. The body was immediately taken back to the Rescue Bureau wharf, and the bureau filled out the corpse form, took a photo, and sent it to the hall for coffin storage, waiting for the family to claim it.</p>

<h3>Japanese Haiyang Company Salvages Sunken Ship Kangtai</h3>
<p>The Chinese merchant ship Kang, loaded with materials for making matches, sank in the Sanjia Shuikou of Wusong last year while sailing to Shanghai. It has not been salvaged to this day. The Jianghai Customs River Patrol Envoy believes that the sunken ship is located at the mouth of the Yangtze River, the Nanpu coast, which is an important channel for ship berthing and navigation. To remove the waterway obstacle, it is urgent to salvage the sunken ship or open a water cannon to bury it so that ship berthing and traffic can be safe. Mi Yada, a Japanese national from Haiyang Company specializing in underwater work, and dozens of Chinese and Japanese workers familiar with swimming methods came to Song yesterday to try to salvage the ship. Several straw sheds were built outside the Customs flag at the Paotaiwan as an engineering office, and various materials and various machines, ropes, and handcarts used for salvaging the ship were piled up. The company is currently arranging and will begin salvaging as soon as preparations are completed.</p>
<h3>Tree crushes Worker to Death</h3>

<h3>Woman with Syphilitic Sores Throws Herself into the River</h3>
<p>No Way Out, Life is Exhausted</p>
<p>At around 8 PM the night before last, the Gaochang Temple Branch of the Second District General Office in Nanshi rescued a woman who had thrown herself into the river. Her face was covered in sores, resembling syphilis. She was immediately taken to the office and questioned by police officer Niu. She stated that her name was Gong Xinbao, 24 years old, from Nanhui. Her family was poor, and she lost her parents at a young age, relying on her brother for a living. Unfortunately, she contracted syphilitic sores and was expelled by her brother. Thinking that there was no way out and life was exhausted, she threw herself into the river to avoid future suffering. According to the statement, Officer Niu transferred her to Wang Quanchang, the chief of the Second District, yesterday, who then transferred her to the General Office for shelter.</p>
<h3>Uncle Controls Brother's Wife</h3>
<p>Li Wuzhou Acts as Husband for his Younger Brother</p>
<p>Li Jin Brings Complaint to her Father</p>
<p>Li Jin, the daughter of Jin Yongfa, a farmer from Yinhang Township in Shanghai East, is 22 years old and married to Li Wusheng, a fellow villager. Their relationship is usually peaceful. However, Wusheng's elder brother, Wuzhou, is violent and rude. He scolds and beats anyone who angers him, using all means possible. Li Jin is often ridiculed, so she has a deep grudge against him. Recently, Li Jin returned to her parents' home, and Li Wusheng, who has the authority of a husband, allowed his wife freedom. However, Li Wuzhou limited his brother's wife to only two nights of stay. After Li Jin returned to her parents' home, she stayed one more night after her mother's insistent request. When she returned, Li Wuzhou severely beat his brother's wife, locking her in the room. When Wusheng returned home, he was ordered by his brother to beat his wife and confine her for four days, so she was not free. She was so angry that she swallowed two silver coins to commit suicide. On the fifth day, after Li Jin regained her freedom, she was ordered to work in the field. She then escaped to her mother's home and told her father, Jin Yongfa, who was greatly alarmed. He rushed his daughter to the hospital for treatment. Fortunately, her life was not in danger and she recovered immediately. However, Jin, believing that Li Wuzhou and Li Wusheng abused his daughter, filed a complaint with the Seventh District Police Station and had the Li brothers arrested together. They were handed over to the Local Court for interrogation yesterday.</p>
<h3>Death Due to Alcohol Abuse</h3>
<p>Wang Jinbiao, a small worker from Jiangbei, 44 years old, lived in a bungalow on Longjiang Road, Yangshupu. The night before last, Wang went out alone to buy alcohol and returned drunk. The next morning, at 9 AM, he had not yet gotten up. His wife called him, but he did not respond. She went to touch him and found that he had died. She hurriedly reported it to the police station, which ordered two Chinese police officers to come. The body was then taken to Tongren Hospital and transferred to the autopsy room for autopsy.</p>
<h3>Zhou Chen, a Woman Who is Open to All</h3>
<p>Zhou Chen, a woman from Suzhou, is 36 years old and still has a beautiful appearance, but her nature is extremely amorous. She was betrothed to Zhou Baoquan, a fellow villager surnamed Zhou, from a young age. She was raised in his home as a child bride. When they grew up, they got married. The relationship between the couple was initially good, but soon they had a son who died shortly after. Zhou was a farmer and lived by farming. However, Chen was lazy and did not care about household chores. Although Zhou repeatedly advised her, it had no effect. As a result, the feelings between the two became increasingly strained, and there were frequent quarrels. Chen could not bear it, so she secretly escaped to Shanghai on April 17 of the 17th year of the Republic. However, the cost of living in Shanghai was very high, and she, a lonely woman, lacked the ability to earn a living. She became increasingly impoverished and had no one to rely on. She then began an affair with Tang Jinquan, a local man. After only a year, they had a disagreement, so she secretly escaped again on April 29 of the 18th year of the Republic. She then met a friend who introduced her to Zhou Delin (34 years old), a Yangzhou native who lived at number 37, Yangjiadu, Pudong, and began living together. At that time, Zhou gave her more than 40 yuan. However, after six months, she disliked that Zhou was a ribbon weaver and his monthly income was very small. Given this situation, working as a prostitute was not a good strategy, so she decided to escape for the third time. She immediately rolled up her clothes and other items and took the opportunity to escape. She then secretly met Chen Jinsheng, a fruit seller, and lived together at number 19, Wangjia Lane, Xiaonanmen, living like a married couple. However, after the woman left, Zhou Delin was heartbroken. He immediately searched everywhere, but there was no news. Until yesterday afternoon at about 2 PM, Zhou was passing by Xiaonanmen when he happened to meet her. He immediately rushed forward and grabbed her, wanting to force her to return home. The woman refused to do so and spoke obscenely and abused him at will, angering Zhou and causing a big conflict. There were many people around trying to persuade them. At that time, Wang Hongquan, a Pudong native who lived in the same house as the woman, saw this and suspected that Zhou was deliberately teasing her along the way. He went forward to intervene as a neighbor, helping the woman add to the violence. In the midst of the chaos, Qiao Maojing, the guard at the 18th post, heard about it and came to bring the three people back to the First Section, Third Branch, where Director Jin conducted a preliminary hearing. Because it was too shameless, he ordered them to prepare a document and transfer the men and women to the Shanghai Local Court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Woman Files Lawsuit to Live with Husband</h3>
<p>The woman, Wang Zhushi, recently hired lawyer E Sen to file a petition with the local court, requesting to live with her husband, Wang Jinfu. The petition stated that she married and lived together in the winter of the fifth year of the Republic. Later, she learned that the defendant still had a legitimate wife. The plaintiff was only able to blame herself for what was already done. Since marrying into the family, she has given birth to three children: an eleven-year-old son, a nine-year-old daughter, and an eight-year-old daughter. Recently, the defendant has not provided support, so she has specifically filed a petition requesting a ruling to live together. The defendant, Wang Jinfu, also hired lawyer Wu Zhiping to prepare a response and filed a counterclaim requesting a divorce. Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, Judge Tong Shenglie opened the court for trial. The plaintiff, Wang Zhushi, stated that she was 32 years old, a Suzhou native, and lived in Zhabei. She requested to live with the defendant. In December of the fifth year of the Republic, matchmaker Gu Jianshan introduced her to the defendant as a wife. At that time, the defendant's father was seriously ill, and he begged the plaintiff to marry into the family to bring good luck. However, the plaintiff was hastily married into the defendant's home, and it was not until she returned home to sweep the tombs during the Qingming Festival the following year that she learned that he still had a legitimate wife. On January 24th of this year, I went to my sister's home, but the defendant ignored me. At the time of the betrothal, there was only 200 yuan of tea money. This time, because the neighbor's daughter was lost, the plaintiff was implicated. Fortunately, the investigation proved that she had been falsely accused and released. Now, she does not want to divorce and requests to live together. The defendant, Wang Jinfu, stated that he was 44 years old, a local native, and that the plaintiff was indeed his concubine. His legitimate wife, Zhang, was married when he was 18 years old and has been married for more than 20 years. The plaintiff has irregular behavior and cannot live together. He requested permission for a divorce. The witness Zhu stated that the plaintiff was his younger sister. Because she lost her father at a young age, he raised her. In the past, because my sister's father-in-law was ill, the matchmaker came to inform me and invited my sister to go to bring good luck. At that time, she was taken away in a carriage, but I never thought that she would be married as soon as she was taken there. At this point in the interrogation, the two lawyers made their statements to each other. The judge then announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict to be announced at 2 PM on the 31st.</p>
<h3>A Tragic Incident of Money Borrowing and Non-Repayment</h3>
<p>Ji Qing, a shop owner at No. 22 Hankou Road in the British Concession, knew Jin Hu, a music teacher, well. Jin frequently borrowed money from Wang (Ji Qing), and this had happened several times. However, he never repaid the loans. Unexpectedly, Jin approached Wang Ji Qing again the other day to borrow money. This enraged Wang, who hid a kitchen knife on his person and lured Jin, under the pretext of going to Xujiahui to collect money. While passing through a secluded spot on Route Ghisi in the French Concession, Wang suddenly pulled out the kitchen knife and slashed Jin's head, shoulders, and other areas more than ten times, causing Jin to fall to the ground, covered in blood and unconscious. A patrolman happened to arrive and arrested Wang, along with the murder weapon, and took them to the police station. Jin was immediately taken to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday, the police sent Wang to the French Court for interrogation. The police chief reported to the court that the plaintiff's injuries were severe and that he was still receiving treatment at the hospital, so he was not present. The murder weapon was presented for inspection. Wang Ji Qing confessed that he committed the crime because the plaintiff had repeatedly borrowed money from him without repayment, which caused him to harbor resentment. The Chinese and Western judges ordered Wang to be remanded in custody, pending the plaintiff's recovery for further interrogation.</p>
<p>An elderly Russian man accused someone of theft, but the evidence was insufficient. The Russian man, Yemelyan Avramov, eighty-nine years old and in good spirits, brought Qin Duofu, also Russian, to the French police station the other day, claiming, "I was taking a tram on the Bund to near Songshan Road when a gold watch and chain, worth more than four hundred yuan, that I was carrying suddenly disappeared. The defendant was the only person next to me at the time, and I saw him hand a bundle wrapped in a handkerchief to another Russian before getting off the tram. Therefore, it is obvious that the gold watch was stolen by the defendant." When questioned, the defendant's statement was evasive. The police chief ordered him to be detained and sent to the French Court for interrogation yesterday. According to the plaintiff's complaint about the theft, the defendant, represented by lawyer Delavet, argued that the defendant had a legitimate occupation and, although he rode the tram with the plaintiff that day, he did not commit any theft. The plaintiff's accusation was without evidence, and the case should be dismissed. After examining the statements, the Chinese and Western judges determined that the evidence presented by the plaintiff was insufficient, the case was dismissed, and the defendant was released.</p>
<h3>A Beggar Kills Another Beggar</h3>
<p>A Strange Incident by the Xiao Garbage Bridge</p>
<p>Xiao Erbao's Excessive Eating Causes Jealousy</p>
<p>Two Young Beggars Commit Murder and Face Imprisonment</p>
<p>At the new garbage bridge on North Xizang Road, a group of beggars help push carts across the bridge and beg along the way. Their daily income is not bad. However, they have rules and regulations, and in the evening, they divide the earnings equally in the alley. However, Xiao Erbao, a native of Ningbo, twenty-four years old, has been wandering in Shanghai for many years. Recently, he joined the group, but because he ate more than the others and did not follow the rules, he was disliked by his companions. Yesterday evening, at around ten o'clock, he was beaten on the head by two young beggars, and he died on the spot. Subsequently, officers from the Huisi Police Station, number 2533, arrived and arrested the two murderers and took them to the police station. This morning, they were sent to the court for questioning. The body was sent to the Tongren Hospital for an autopsy.</p>
<h3>The County Public Security Bureau Dismisses Detectives</h3>
<p>Shen Jinghua, the head of the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau, dismissed four detectives from the bureau, Zhang Quanzhou, Xu Yulin, Ren Xiangyun, and Jiang Qiaosheng, for ineffective case handling and causing trouble outside. Their licenses were also revoked.</p>
<h3>The Business Reorganization Committee Collects New Members</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Business Reorganization Committee has been instructed to reorganize various commercial groups and provide guidance. According to the regulations, it should be reorganized into a formal chamber of commerce. It has already been approved by the party and government authorities. In addition to the original members of the three old chambers of commerce, representatives from various industries and new members representing companies, firms, and shops are being recruited to reorganize and elect officials. A large-scale recruitment notice was issued yesterday.</p>
<h3>Police Salaries for May Paid Yesterday</h3>
<p>The salaries for the Shanghai Special Municipality Public Security Bureau officers and police for May were originally scheduled to be paid today. However, because today is the anniversary of the May 30th Incident and security is important, Mayor Zhang ordered the Finance Bureau to allocate the funds early. Yesterday morning, Director Yuan informed the heads of each district and team to collect the funds, and in the afternoon, personnel were dispatched to each district and team to supervise the roll call and distribution.</p>
<h3>Reiteration of the Method for Using Goods Receipts as Collateral</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Transportation Office sent a letter to the Transportation Association yesterday, informing all companies that the directors of the two railway lines had investigated that in May of the Republic of China year fourteen, to facilitate merchants using goods receipts as collateral from banks, regulations for using the two railway lines' goods receipts as collateral for loans were established and implemented starting June 1st of that year. According to the regulations, if merchants use goods receipts to obtain loans from banks, if the goods are mortgaged to the bank at the time of consignment, the consignor must indicate on the receipt (This goods has been mortgaged to the bank). At the same time, the stationmaster should also add a note and sign it. The bank holding the receipt should also declare to the arrival stationmaster to request a transfer. At the same time, the consignee must also make the same note, sign, and stamp to comply with the procedures and avoid mistakes. However, it has been found that recently, in order to save procedures, the regulations are not followed, and goods are directly mortgaged to banks. The mortgagors do not indicate on the goods receipt, and the banks also do not declare to the stationmaster for transfer according to regulations. Once the mortgagors repay the debt, they directly hand over the original bill to pick up the goods, making it impossible to investigate. If any disputes occur, it will be very troublesome. Continuing this way is not appropriate. Therefore, this letter is sent to your association, hoping that you will inform all companies that in the future, they must follow the established regulations. Otherwise, any disputes or errors will be the responsibility of the carrier company. Please investigate and reply.</p>
<h3>Circular on Exemption from Storage Fees</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Transportation Association sent a letter to the Railway Bureau Transportation Office yesterday requesting exemption from storage fees. According to letters from various transportation companies, the goods stored in the warehouses at Maigen Road and Rihui Port stations have exceeded the free period and require payment of storage fees. However, the export goods at these two stations often cannot be loaded and shipped upon arrival due to a lack of vehicles, resulting in long-term storage. Please forward this difficulty to the Railway Bureau for approval to exempt the overdue storage fees, etc. The association has verified that the matter is true and has prepared a letter requesting exemption. After receiving the letter, the Railway Bureau Transportation Office approved the request and replied that if the goods stored at the station are indeed overdue due to a lack of vehicles, the storage fees should be waived. However, each transportation company should submit a letter from the stationmaster to this office for verification. This letter is hereby replied.</p>
<h3>The Anderson Factory Strike Was Interrogated Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to news from the Anderson Electric Light Factory, workers have been on strike for three days due to the factory's oppression. Various sectors have been visiting the strike committee to express their sympathy. When party and government agencies went to the factory to investigate, the factory claimed that no one was there and refused to meet them. However, the factory has a lot of inventory, which the factory's trucks, along with equipment and documents, are transporting to the concession's office. They are selling the goods and hiring new people to continue operating as usual, preparing for a long-term shutdown. They want to put economic pressure on the workers and make their lives unstable, causing them to disperse on their own. Then the factory can do whatever it wants.</p>
<h3>A New Port Was Discovered Near Haizhou</h3>
<p>The place name is Daizikou</p>
<p>China has never had its own sea charts, so it only uses sea charts published by Britain and Japan. However, these charts are often inaccurate for surveying China's coast, especially the section from north of Sheshan to south of Qingdao, which is the most rudimentary. Therefore, navigators find it very difficult. According to news from the General Association of Chinese Merchant Ship Drivers, the association recently received a report from its member Shi Junjunpei that his ship, the Huayu, recently discovered an anchorage between Dapugang and Chenjiagang where goods can be loaded and unloaded. The place name is Daizikou, located approximately at 34 degrees 31 minutes north latitude and 119 degrees 43 minutes east longitude. The harbor bottom is sandy and muddy. As far as is known, there are no reefs. The surrounding area is flat like a basin. At high tide, the area is about six or seven hundred feet wide and twenty-three or four feet deep. At half tide, it is about two hundred feet wide and sixteen or seventeen feet deep. At low tide, it is about sixty or seventy feet wide and about ten feet deep. Outside the mouth, there is a sandbar, which is hard and about one and a half miles long. It divides the water in the middle of the mouth into two and is very winding, so the locals call it "Crotch Sand." The water on the beach is five or six feet shallower than inside the mouth, making navigation very inconvenient. It is urgent to survey it and add markers for convenient passage. In the past, this mouth produced a lot of salt, about two million dan per year, which was transported out of the mouth by sailboats to be loaded onto ships. However, there is a lot of rain in summer and a lot of wind in autumn and winter, so on average, only four or five months of the year are available for transportation. Inconvenient transportation has led to a sharp decline in production. In the future, if this mouth can be slightly reorganized and used for ship transportation, salt production will definitely increase greatly, which will greatly benefit the local people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Fire Alarm on Yongxing Road Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Xiangtai Cigarette and Paper Shop on Yongxing Road in Zhabei, owned by Ye Keyu, a native of Ningbo, suddenly caught fire at around 5:55 yesterday morning for unknown reasons. The first, second, and third sections of the Zhabei Fire Brigade rushed to put out the fire. However, the fire was fierce, and it took the firefighters until 7:30 to completely extinguish it. Three houses were destroyed. The cause of the fire is being disputed between the carelessness and the neighboring tiger stove. Subsequently, the patrol police arrived and arrested the fire starter and turned them over to the Eighty-Fifth District Public Security Bureau for investigation and handling.</p>

<h3>The Fruit and Produce Trade Association Established</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Fruit and Produce Trade Association held its inaugural meeting at the Maojia Lane Fruit Association Hall in Dadongmen yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM.

Lin Meishu, representative of the City Party Department, Sheng Juncai, representative of the Social Bureau, and Lu Wenshao, representative of the Business Rectification Committee, as well as other guests, such as lawyer Chen Wenzhao, totaling over one hundred and thirty people, attended. After the meeting, the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting and the preparations. Then the articles of association were discussed. The full text of the articles of association contained twenty-nine articles, which were read one by one and passed.

<h3>The Issue of Second Place in the Games</h3>
<p>Competed for by China and the Philippines</p>
<p>It has been determined that Japan has won the overall championship for this year's games. However, the issue of second place will be decided by today's China-Philippines volleyball final and the Philippines-Japan basketball final. If the Philippines wins all today, they will win two championships, and the second place in this year's games will belong to the Philippines. If they lose all, the Philippines will completely fail to win any championships in this year's games. Although China has won one volleyball championship, it can still get second place. If the Philippines wins against Japan in basketball but loses to China in volleyball, China and the Philippines will each get one championship. However, the Philippines has won more second places in other sports than China, so the second place in the games will still belong to the Philippines. If yesterday's football match gave China the opportunity to continue the match and win the championship, then if China continues to win the volleyball championship today, it can win the second place in the games. Therefore, not giving China the opportunity to continue the football match yesterday and reserving the football championship for the next games is greatly related to China.</p>
<h3>Japanese Sports Organizations</h3>
<p>Disputes Arise</p>
<p>Track and Field Association to Withdraw from Sports Association</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 29th: The track and field events of the Far Eastern Games concluded on the 28th. That evening, the Japan Amateur Athletic Federation held a committee meeting to discuss whether the Federation should withdraw from the Japan Sports Association, or plan to reorganize the Association's content and organization, due to a dispute with the Japan Sports Association over rule issues before the Games. The details of the discussion were kept strictly confidential and could not be fully learned. However, it is generally believed that the argument for severing ties is the strongest. After the Games conclude, this dispute will inevitably surface and become a major issue in the sports world. Its future development is worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Men's Football Championship</p>
<p>Chinese Football Unlucky to Tie with Japan</p>
<p>Result: 3-3 Draw</p>
<p>Each Scored Once in the First Half, Twice in the Second</p>
<p>Referee Was Unfair and Violated Rules</p>
<p>China Argues for a Replay, Japan Refuses</p>
<h3>Championship Reserved for Resolution at the Next Session</h3>
<p>Our newspaper, Tokyo, 29th: In the China-Japan football final, both teams scored three goals, resulting in a tie. Each side scored once in the first half, and twice in the second. The biased and unfair refereeing caused disappointment among the Chinese players and diminished the enjoyment of the spectators. Overseas Chinese expressed their dissatisfaction loudly. China's failure to win and Japan's failure to lose were due to this reason.</p>
<h3>Championship Reserved</h3>
<p>When the China-Japan football match ended in a tie, the Japanese team immediately left the field, while the eleven Chinese players stood in the field waiting for extra time. At that time, everyone gathered to criticize the unfair refereeing for about twenty minutes. Suddenly, news came that there would be no further match, and they were asked to return to their residences. The reporter immediately inquired with all related parties and learned that officials from both sides would hold an emergency meeting to discuss the matter. Subsequently, a visit was made to Li Hangan, the Chinese football coach, who said that according to the football rules, if the score is tied, extra time should be played to determine the winner. As there was still plenty of time today, the match could continue. However, the Japanese staff unexpectedly announced the end of the match, which was beyond our expectations. The Chinese head coach, Ma Yuehan, immediately protested to the Japanese Referee Committee. Around 7 pm, both sides held a meeting at the YMCA. The Chinese representatives stated their willingness to continue the match and criticized the referee's violation of the rules. Wang Kaishe of the Chinese football team asked for an explanation of the reasons, but the participants had differing opinions on the interpretation of the rules, leading to a heated debate for over two hours. The Japanese representatives insisted on their tough stance and passed a resolution stating that there was no need for a replay. The football championship will be reserved until the next Games to be determined. We cannot agree to this, but the situation is such that there is nothing we can do.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Cheer</h3>
<p>The news of the China-Japan final spread throughout the city, and countless spectators attended the match. Many overseas Chinese came, as this was China's only guaranteed championship. After being crestfallen for days, they could finally raise their eyebrows in triumph. Hundreds of Chinese students organized a cheering squad, with white shirts and red hats complementing each other. They held small national flags that fluttered in the wind, creating a colorful spectacle. Throughout the ninety minutes, cheers rose and fell, with the fervor reaching its peak.</p>
<h3>Calm and Quiet</h3>
<p>As the battle began, the Chinese and Japanese armies clashed, with several back-and-forth movements but nothing critical. After three minutes, Japan took the lead. Nozawa and Teshima passed to each other, advancing deeply into the area. Haruyama on the left wing vigorously attacked and shot. The Japanese continued their siege, still pressing hard. Finally, Zhou Xianyan showed his agility, and Li Tiansheng demonstrated his all-around prowess. Before long, everything became calm and quiet.</p>
<h3>Fleeting Moment</h3>
<p>With the Chinese interior calm and quiet, the five forwards advanced together, breaking through barriers with ease. In the blink of an eye, the enemy's goal was in sight. Cao Guicheng, anxious and impatient, lost his composure. A good opportunity vanished like a fleeting moment.</p>
<h3>Nitpicking</h3>
<p>The Chinese forwards were swift and extraordinary. The Japanese, with a little carelessness, were broken through the line. The referee Takeuchi nitpicked and arbitrarily called an offside, secretly relieving the Japanese encirclement. This illegal action was ridiculous. Once, when Chen Jiaqiu dribbled the ball forward, the Japanese inside defender Goto illegally obstructed him, but the penalty was imposed on Chen instead of Goto. This is just one example. The rest can be inferred.</p>
<h3>City Gate Falls</h3>
<p>At 25 minutes, the situation took a sharp turn. The five Japanese forwards advanced like a long snake, heads and tails moving together. The Chinese interior was caught off guard and overwhelmed. The front and rear defense lines crumbled. Haruyama on the right wing crossed to the center, and center forward Teshima attacked the goal with great force. The Japanese scored the first goal, and cheers erupted throughout the stadium.</p>
<h3>Enemies Terrified</h3>
<p>The Chinese army attacked more than it defended, but it was often obstructed by the referee, causing morale to decline. In vain did they call out helplessly. Once, after being attacked, Teshima personally led the forwards deep into the area. Zhou Xianyan stood alone, suddenly rushing forward to meet him. Fortunately, Teshima was terrified and missed the shot.</p>
<h3>Declared Invalid</h3>
<p>At 30 minutes, Ye Beihua replaced Chen Jiaqiu in the battle, creating a fresh force with great brilliance. The Chinese army surrounded the enemy's goal and attacked relentlessly. Ye repeatedly shot hard, but all were saved by goalkeeper Saito. Dai Linjing once scored a goal, but the referee said he was offside and declared it invalid. The spectators were saddened and the players lost their color. The power was in the referee, and there was nothing they could do.</p>
<h3>Triumphant Move</h3>
<p>However, the Chinese army's momentum was overwhelming. After ten minutes, the Japanese gradually became unable to withstand it. Sun Jinshun on the left wing showed his lifelong unique skills, passing through the enemy lines. The front and rear defenders looked at each other in dismay. His divine foot rose, and the ball went into the net. China and Japan each scored one goal. The Japanese attacked once again but were unsuccessful. The Chinese army took advantage of the situation and went straight in. Sun Jinshun was about to use his skills again, but goalkeeper Saito arrived before Sun and saved it in time. The first half ended in a 1-1 draw.</p>
<h3>Death and Rebirth</h3>
<p>At the start of the second half, the Japanese took advantage of the wind and waves, launching a large-scale attack. Feyenoord and oblique good opportunities are often lost. Goalkeeper Zhou Xianyan's eyes were sharp, his hands and feet were light. He prostrated himself to save the ball, a truly courageous act of death and rebirth.</p>
<h3>A Surprise and a Joy</h3>
<p>After this, they attacked each other, each showing their skills. Dai Linjing received the ball from the left and shot it, but missed. Then he attacked the enemy's goal directly, but was intercepted by Takeuchi. At the 13th minute, Takayama on the right wing crossed the ball. Zhou prostrated to save it, but Teshima and Shinoshima both shot the ball into the goal. The Japanese then led 2-1. Within two minutes, the Chinese army showed great prowess, driving straight in and the enemy retreated, breaking through the line. Chen Guangyao arrived like lightning, catching the goalkeeper off guard. Chen then made it a 2-2 draw. Within two minutes, there was a surprise and a joy, a truly great change.</p>
<h3>Good Fortune</h3>
<p>The fierce attacks by both sides were astonishing. Both armies had repeated opportunities to go deep, but the shots were inaccurate, and there were no results after several back and forth movements. Once, Huang Duanhua committed a foul and a penalty kick was awarded. The Japanese were overjoyed, believing they would definitely score. But the ball was kicked high over the goal. This is what is meant by good fortune.</p>
<h3>Disaster Strikes</h3>
<p>The Japanese were arrogant and overbearing for a time, and with the invisible assistance of the referee, they felt even more formidable. They attacked repeatedly but were blocked by us, and the Chinese army's counterattack was also astonishing. However, they were repeatedly blocked by the unfair referee, and their progress was not smooth. The Japanese had more opportunities to counterattack as a result. Disaster struck the Chinese suddenly, losing their third goal. Before the loss of this goal, the referee already had the whistle in his mouth, ready to blow and declare an offside. But he suddenly saw the Japanese attacking and acted as if he hadn't seen it. Our army protested but was ignored.</p>
<h3>Preserve Glory</h3>
<p>Under all sorts of unfavorable conditions, the Chinese army still showed the fearless national spirit of our people, fighting tirelessly. Wherever their feet went, the enemy was defeated. Huang Ruihua sent a long ball, and Dai Linjing took the opportunity to shoot, making it 2-3, preserving the glory of remaining undefeated.</p>
<h3>Remaining Bravery</h3>
<p>In the last fifteen minutes, the Chinese attacked incessantly. The Japanese only tried to defend desperately to maintain an equal score. At that time, Sun Zhongshun, Chen Guangyao, and Dai Linjing all took the lead, fighting bravely. However, they often misplaced the ball, which was a pity. Finally, Cao Guicheng had a wonderful cross, but it was still unsuccessful. The result was a 3-3 draw.</p>
<h3>Discontent Must Be Expressed</h3>
<p>After the football match today, all the Chinese team members were indignant. Captain Sun Jin spoke to the reporter about the referee's obvious unfairness. Our team members fought with all their might today, but they were constantly subjected to unfair refereeing, making it extraordinarily difficult. For example, before the third goal, the referee was about to declare an offside, already with the whistle in his mouth. But when he saw the other side's players rushing in, he declared it valid. Our goalkeeper initially thought the enemy was offside, so he was relaxed and unprepared. The Japanese took the opportunity to kick in. Also, when the time limit for the match had expired and the winner had not been determined, extra time should have been given according to usual practice. If the time was not extended, our side should have been notified. This kind of action was a major violation of the rules. One of the responsible persons in the Chinese Committee also told the reporter that the football rules are originally stipulated internationally. Although the football rules of the Far Eastern Games are slightly different, the referee's illegal actions today are truly a laughing stock. The decision of the Football Committee also makes it difficult to understand its true meaning. Li Huitang, a team member who could not participate due to illness, told the reporter that the main reason for today's failure was the referee's unfairness. The secondary reason was the lack of guiding talent for our forward warriors to make agile attacks, causing the formation to be slightly chaotic, losing a great opportunity several times.</p>
<h3>Match Summary</h3>
<p>China: 3 corner kicks, 4 free kicks, 29 shots on goal, 1 penalty kick.</p>

As a result, the first set was 21-18, and the second set was 21-19. Our country then defeated Japan 2-0. In the first set, the three great generals, Qiu Guangshuang, Xie Liying, and Chen Xibing, made skillful spikes to win. In the second set, Xing Guirong replaced Xu Heng. After the start, Zhu Zucheng softly returned the ball, confusing the enemy and making them unsure of what to do. In addition, the strong pressure from Qiu Guangshuang, Cao Tingzan, and Chen Xibing left the Japanese with no space to maneuver. Li Lianying's gentle spike also won a lot of applause.</p>

<p>Opinions of Philippine Players</p>

<h3>Talk from Dong Shouyi of China</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 29th: Mr. Dong Shouyi, the instructor of the Chinese basketball team at the Far Eastern Games, told reporters that the reasons for China's defeat to the Philippines need not be said much. The Philippines team is indeed more powerful than China. In the game, our team fought with a dignified attitude. It had the upper hand in the first half, but due to failures in the battle in the second half, the Chinese team was in a bitter battle and lost as a result. We are not satisfied with today's performance. However, the referee seems to be doing too many jump balls.</p>
<h3>Opinions of Philippine Players</h3>
<p>Whalen Naiwa, a basketball player for the Philippine team, told reporters that our team only won after a bitter battle. The Chinese team this time is truly strong and fierce. Although the Japanese team's skills are skillful, their tactics are always the same. Our team has studied this point thoroughly. However, the Chinese team's tactics often change, making them more threatening compared to the Japanese team.</p>

After selecting the players into the room, staff members Lin Zecang and Yu Binqi announced a curfew to rest and recuperate. Staff member Lin Zecang, Yu Binqi and the Japanese representative Shanghu have been drawing up the list of individual championship list these past few days as follows:</p>

At that time, because Ma Jun could not make the trip, Guo Fuhai was elected to accompany the team to Japan. It is said that the conference deeply regretted Luo and Ma's regrettable situation.</p>

<p>China Wins Against the Philippines in the Women's Volleyball Exhibition</p>
<h3>Boxing in the Games</h3>
<p>(Qu Jingzhou from Tokyo)</p>
<p>Japan and the Philippines Emphasize Boxing Competition</p>
<p>If China Promotes It, It Would Not Be Difficult to Become Dominant in East Asia</p>
<p>Although boxing is one of the most popular skills in the West, there has never been such an item in the Far Eastern Games. From this Games onward, the Japan Sports Association has recognized it as an open competition, and there is news that it will be officially listed as a Games item. This is also something that those who are interested in sports should pay attention to. Previously, Japan had unofficially negotiated with China and the Philippines, proposing to include boxing in the Games, but because a definite response was not received, the matter was dropped. When the Ninth World Games were held in the Netherlands, Japan sent two representatives to participate, but because their feathers were not yet full and they had no proposals, they retreated silently. This year, the Ninth Far Eastern Games were held in Tokyo. Japanese boxing enthusiasts proposed to the Japan Sports Association to include boxing as an open competition, and it was recognized by the Sports Association. They then sought the consent of China and the Philippines. Because China was a temporary proposal and there was no precedent, they did not comment.</p>
<p>Boxing has a history of twenty years in the Philippines. Its athletes have won the world championship once, and there are many famous boxers. However, the more skilled fighters are mostly professional boxers, and the strength of ordinary players is not very strong. However, the trend of boxing has been more popular in China and Japan due to the influence of the United States. This year, they also sent five athletes with the athletes who attended the Far Eastern Games to Japan to compete with Japan and to prepare for the International Games held in the United States in 1912.</p>
<p>Boxing has a characteristic in competition: it is classified by the weight of the athletes (for example, 112 pounds or less, 118 pounds or less, 126 pounds or less, 135 pounds or less, 147 pounds or less, etc.). Japanese people are naturally short, and they suffer in other sports such as basketball and football due to their small size. Fortunately, in boxing, opponents of the same weight compete, which can make up for the natural deficiencies of the Japanese. Therefore, the Japanese promote it very vigorously. The core athletes include Murakami Xu, Igarashi Muta, Kaya Yamamoto, Yamazaki, and Ebizawa.</p>
<p>China has a deep understanding of boxing. The so-called Wudang Shaolin schools have long been well-known. Although their nature is different from Western boxing, Chinese people are naturally talented in boxing and are very confident. Recently, Mr. Zhang Zhijiang, Chu Minyi and other gentlemen have been promoting national art without sparing effort. If we study boxing in light of the current situation of the Far Eastern Games, it will not be difficult to become dominant in East Asia in the future.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes from the Games</h3>
<p>(Liang Zi, from Tokyo)</p>
<p>The Japanese Youth Hall, where the athletes are staying, is home to not only athletes from China, the Philippines, and Japan, but also Indian "A San" (a derogatory term for Indians). Logically, with language barriers, it should be hard to communicate, but they don't seem to have any trouble at all. Once, I saw some Japanese children talking to some Filipinos. The Filipinos only said "华太细" (Huatai xi - a transliteration of "Watashi," meaning "I" in Japanese), and then started pointing and gesturing, nodding and winking. The children watched and responded with "Yes" or "No," correcting themselves when wrong. They also raised their little hands to imitate. The Filipinos kept nodding and smiling. It was truly wonderful! Only they understood what they were saying.</p>
<p>Opening the doors, the Far Eastern Games used to be a competition only among China, the Philippines, and Japan. This year, the "A San" joined, adding another country. I hear that from now on, anyone living in the East can join. This way, the athletes will have more diverse colors of red, yellow, black, and white. If everyone starts using gestures to communicate, a "Far Eastern Gesture Conference" might be quite interesting.</p>
<p>Talking about Yun and losing his hat: Ever since the National Games produced Ms. Sun Guiyun, everyone knows that if you don't talk about sports, then fine.</p>
<p>But once you do, it's all about Sun Guiyun. Person A says, "I wonder what Sun Guiyun is like. I always think she's great." Person B says, "Sun Guiyun is just Sun Guiyun. Why are people so infatuated?" Person C says, "Sun Guiyun is an athlete. Haven't you seen the Japanese female athletes? They're similar." Person D says, "Is that so?" When the games opened, everyone jumped up and said, "Sun Guiyun is really like that? So that's Sun Guiyun! No wonder someone said, 'I don't want to be the Commander-in-Chief, I just want to meet Sun Guiyun! Haha!'" While speaking, they couldn't help but move their hands and feet. A friend next to them, looking through binoculars, suddenly lost his hat. Strange, isn't it?</p>
<p>Insomnia Statistics: The night before the games is very important. The athletes need to rest, but the other staff and those there to support should also be prepared. But in reality, the more you want to sleep, the harder it is. Thinking it over, you close your eyes, but you can't sleep. The reason is unclear. So, the insomniacs that night, no matter how long, probably numbered at least one hundred and eight thousand.</p>
<h3>Random Notes</h3>
<p>(Lin Zecang)</p>
<p>(Tokyo Correspondence) The Far Eastern Games officially opened at noon on the 24th of this month. The reporter and Yu Bingqi and others traveled by car. The solemn ceremony has been reported in this newspaper. Now, I will record interesting news from the venue on that day. Thousands of people gathered in front of the stands.</p>
<p>Like brocade among the masses. One can imagine the grand scale of the event.</p>
<p>(1) Zhang Boling Standing Out</p>
<p>Among the chairmen were seven or eight important Japanese officials, all short and with Eastern features. Only Zhang Boling, the chief representative of China, stood out. Even the Indian representative was shorter. He truly stood out like a crane among chickens.</p>
<p>(2) Chinese Female Athletes Exceptionally Beautiful</p>
<p>Among all the teams parading around the venue, the Chinese female athletes had the most beautiful outfits and vibrant spirits. The female track and field athletes all wore white silk shirts and black shorts (very short, almost exposing the thighs), with bare legs and feet. They also wore white headscarves and had short haircuts (as the Japanese pointed out). They were a sight to behold, and the overseas Chinese applauded enthusiastically.</p>
<p>(3) Gender Equality in the Chinese Oath</p>
<p>The oath-taking ceremony for Japan, the Philippines, and India was performed by three or four men. Only China pioneered gender equality, with two men holding the flag and two women guarding the flag. One person recited the oath in a loud and clear voice, demonstrating the chivalrous spirit of athletes.</p>
<p>(4) Cheerleading by the Chinese Supporters</p>
<p>Chinese students in Japan formed a special "Chinese Cheerleading Squad" with many large and small national flags. They arrived at the venue in cars to cheer on the team, wearing red and blue hats. China's victory over the Philippines in baseball was partly due to the cheers of the "Chinese Cheerleading Squad."</p>
<h3>Detailed Records of the 9th Far Eastern Games (2)</h3>
<p>Disputes at the Games (Qian Hua)</p>
<p>Indian Athletes Refuse to Fly the British Flag</p>
<p>Kishi Seiichi Offends the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires</p>
<p>(Tokyo Correspondence) The 9th Far Eastern Games officially opened at noon on the 24th.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony was held at 12 o'clock. Before that, there were frequent disturbances, but fortunately, they all passed peacefully. The reporter recounts the events, which are quite interesting.</p>
<p>Initially, after the Indian delegation of four people arrived in Japan, the issue of hanging the national flag arose. The Japanese Athletic Association contacted the British Embassy, insisting on flying the British flag at the venue. By the morning of the 22nd, the venues were all set up, and the national flags of China, Japan, the United States, and Britain were hung everywhere. The Indian delegation formally protested, expressing their willingness to withdraw from the Games. To calm the situation, the Japanese Athletic Association sent personnel to contact the British Embassy again, and the British Embassy finally agreed to hang the Indian territory flag instead. This matter was resolved, but all the Indians living in Japan still expressed great dissatisfaction, unanimously refusing to recognize that the four Indian athletes had the right to represent India.</p>
<p>Secondly, there was the issue of Dr. Kishi Seiichi, the president of the Games, offending Mr. Jiang Hongjie, the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires in Japan. Initially, the Chinese Embassy in Japan received a telegram from Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, appointing Chargé d'Affaires Jiang to attend the opening ceremony on behalf of the government and read the congratulatory message. After receiving the telegram, Jiang contacted the Japanese Athletic Association by telephone that afternoon, but the responsible person was not available. So, the next morning (the 23rd), he personally went to the Japanese Youth Hall to find Kishi Seiichi. Kishi happened to be at the Painting Hall, so the secretary of the Youth Hall, Mr. Zhang Yongjing, accompanied him to meet Kishi. Kishi said in front of the Painting Hall that such a major event should not be discussed by telephone. The order of ceremony had already been printed, and this matter could not be done. His words were quite forceful and unreasonable. Jiang angrily said he would go to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, and there was no result. That afternoon, Jiang visited Mr. Hao Boyang, the head of the Chinese delegation, saying that Kishi was insulting the delegation. They should formally protest and demand a formal apology by 8:30 a.m. the next morning (the 24th), and that Foreign Minister Wang's congratulatory message be officially included in the order of ceremony. Otherwise, they could all withdraw and not attend the ceremony. Hao immediately negotiated with the head of the Japanese Athletic Association. Both sides ran around to mediate, and the matter was not resolved until 12 o'clock that night. The Japanese Athletic Association apologized and agreed to include Foreign Minister Wang's congratulatory message in the order of ceremony, and the storm finally subsided. This is another matter. There were also disputes regarding the rules adopted for this year's Games. Initially, the Japanese Athletic Association, in the name of President Kishi Seiichi, telegraphed the Chinese Athletic Association, agreeing to continue using the Far Eastern rules. However, after the Chinese delegation arrived in Japan, the Japanese Track and Field Federation proposed changing to international rules. Zhang Boling strongly opposed this, citing Kishi's telegram as proof. Japan then turned its anger towards Kishi Seiichi and issued a statement in the name of the Japanese Track and Field Association, saying that Kishi was too arbitrary and that the records of this year's Games would not be recognized by the international community. It is said that this matter was an internal conflict within the Japanese Athletic Association.</p>

Yesterday, at 2 p.m. on the 27th, the Examination Committee held its second plenary meeting at the Jiangsu Province Party Headquarters. Chairman Chen Hexian presided over the meeting as scheduled.

It was resolved that the examination would be held concurrently with the provincial Examination Committee on July 10th and 11th.

<h3>Understanding Karma, Xiong Peng</h3>
<p>Liaoyuan is the reception monk of Tianning Temple in Yizheng. He is short, fat, bald, with long eyebrows, and often walks along the road with an iron shovel to remove rubble for passersby. The villagers all call him "Old Monk," but they really don't know how old he is. He looks like he's fifty-something, but he's strong and agile, not like his age. He once said that he had cremated the abbot of Baofang Temple for more than ten generations. If so, then his age should be over a hundred years old. It can be seen that the monk's actions are different, but not evil, so it is worth recording.</p>
<p>No one knows since when Liaoyuan lived in Tianning Temple, because Liaoyuan was already there when the monks arrived. He looks kind and solemn, and doesn't like to chat. If someone asks him how old he is, he always pretends to be deaf and doesn't answer. There is nothing in his residence except a table and a wide couch. The wide couch is used to store traveling monks, and the table is used for his meals. His clothes are very simple, a black robe that hasn't been changed for several years, but it's not shabby. When the abbot gives him new clothes, he puts them on the couch. Sometimes, traveling monks steal them. Liaoyuan waits for them to leave and says with a smile, "It's great that you took them. From now on, I don't have to dry them in the sun, and I don't have to worry about rats gnawing on them." His humorous state can be seen in this. But his voice is strong and firm, and the rats can't help but fear him. A traveling monk from the countryside was very violent. Liaoyuan put his hand on his shoulder and said that monks should not be like this. The monk immediately covered his head and ran away. He likes cleanliness and often smiles and says to people when he removes weeds in the temple, "With me here, I won't let these things get ahead." He often talks to the children in the town in a gentle tone. If someone asks about his life, he pretends to be deaf and leaves. His chest is flat and has no indentation. When asked why, he always says, "All my money is hidden here, unlike the rich people who are always worried." A local notable wanted to see his skills, but Liaoyuan firmly refused, saying that the carter on Tianning Bridge was killed by a military officer with just a bang. "You still want to see martial arts for what?" His voice is clear and never sighing, perhaps it is the cultivation of Buddhism. Now, the abbots in the temple have changed several times, but Liaoyuan is still strong. Some say that he was a great thief in the past. That statement is also quite credible, because not growing old and not declining is very strange. But he is strange but not evil, so I am passing on the information.</p>
<h3>Interesting Advertisements, Li Shuping</h3>
<p>Advertising has become the most vigorous driving force in the modern business world, which is universally recognized. The key point of advertising, whether it is text or traditional Chinese painting, is to easily attract attention. A large Japanese printing house recently released an interesting new advertisement that has been highly praised by the business world. Here is a translation:</p>
<p>Gentlemen, if you go to our library to buy books, you can get the following benefits: (1) The price is cheap, like buying a lottery ticket (a profitable investment); (2) The book decoration is as beautiful as a song and dance star; (3) The writer's penmanship is as clear as crystal; (4) The paper material is as strong and smooth as elephant skin; (5) The book delivery is as fast as a cannonball; (6) Protecting the parcel is as attentive as a husband cherishing his beloved wife.</p>
<h3>Interesting Events in Sihui, Wang Yanjin</h3>
<p>In the afternoon of May 24th, I first visited the calligraphy and painting exhibition of the Wenyuan Art School and the health sports meet of the YMCA. Then, I joined the competition of the Qixin Ping Pong Team and the banquet of the Caoye Society. I expressed all the sorrow of the past six days. So I recorded the interesting events and stories I encountered with my pen.</p>
<p>My home is full of ancient and modern paintings. This morning, my friend Li Yuzeng called me and asked me to visit the calligraphy and painting exhibition of the teachers and students of the Wenyuan Art School at the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai. When I arrived, Mr. Li was already there before me. Mr. Junzhang is a new writer and also roughly understands calligraphy and painting. Reading Xie Gongzhan's flowers and Ma Gongyu's seal characters, he exclaimed in admiration. And I had already admired the flowers and birds of Mr. Qi Weixin in the Lingbian Student Literature Series. Today, I saw his works again, which are more refined than before. It can be seen that his progress is rapid. Others, such as Zhang Qilin's essays and Zhang Yuying's seals, are also quite remarkable.</p>
<p>"Let me get a shot, and feel relieved." After the meeting, I walked to the YMCA on Sichuan Road to visit the Health Sports Meet. Although the venue was not very large, it was well-arranged. Around the venue were posters and slogans of the Medical Department, such as advising people to beware of cholera and pay attention to public hygiene, which were very eye-catching. In the middle of the venue, the Health Bureau displayed health specimens on a large vegetable table, which had everything that should be there. At one corner of the venue, three or four women gently persuaded people to get vaccinated. Quite a few people were moved to get the shot. There was a worker who stepped forward and asked for a shot. The woman said to him, "You may feel a slight pain after the shot." The worker replied, "If you give me a shot and make me very happy, how can I say it hurts?" Those who heard it couldn't help but smile.</p>
<p>"Sweating profusely, destroying the strong enemy." After the meeting, I hadn't walked a few steps when I met Mr. Chen of the Qixin Ping Pong Team, who invited me to go to Avenue Joffre for a friendly match with the Qingyi Team. I followed him. I was the first to take the field. My opponent was Mr. Sun, the captain of the Qingyi Team, who had excellent ping pong skills. At first, I thought I couldn't beat him. But during the warm-up, I found that Mr. Sun was not good at short balls, and that every time he hit the ball at his left corner, he would return a high ball. Taking advantage of his high ball, I repeatedly hit short, fast balls to his left three or four times, and I would be sure to win. In the first two games, I was badly defeated. My Qixin comrades were disappointed, and the members of the Qingyi Team applauded endlessly. This greatly boosted my spirits. I carefully responded to the attack and won three consecutive games, turning defeat into victory. I was very lucky. During the battle, I was sweating profusely and my clothes were soaked. I took a shower and went to the banquet of the Caoye Society. It was already six forty-five.</p>
<p>"The revolution succeeded in China." When I arrived at the banquet location, the comrades were already gathered in the room. At the banquet, my uncle Tiehua introduced me to Mr. Zhang Ruogu. Mr. Zhang knew that I had studied at the Tongwen Academy and knew a little Japanese, so he said to me, "I can only say (Wa Taiku Xi, Wa Anata Toku Aishi Mus - I love you) in Japanese." Mr. Zhang flaunts his romantic nature, so it's no wonder he pays attention to such words. That night, my friend Kim Ki-yeo from Korea, a revolutionary exile in China holding an important position in the Revolutionary Party, said that the success of the Korean revolution depended entirely on the assistance of our country. He said that today's East Asia is in great danger. Japanese imperialism and white imperialism are attacking very rapidly. If we do not find ways to resist, our country, as well as India, Korea, Annam, Taiwan, etc., will be wiped out. His words are worth pondering deeply.</p>
<h3>The Engagement of Photographer Mr. Lang Jingshan at Xuyuan, Xin San Records the Grand Event</h3>
<p>Mr. Lang Jingshan is a well-known photographer at home and abroad. His love for photography is so great that he even forgets to eat and sleep in his work.</p>
<p>After proposing a divorce, he spent several years as a widower, working on his photography and indulging in nature. Who knew that his second partner would be gradually introduced through the camera and become a good match! It turned out that there was a female accountant, Ms. Lei Peizhi, in the Shanghai Yingming Photo Studio, who was not only skilled in accounting but also good at photography. Because Mr. Lang was busy with his affairs, he often entrusted the studio to develop and print his photographs. As a result, he and Ms. Lei developed a friendship from acquaintance, and from friendship, love blossomed, and they announced their engagement. Now, I will record the grand event of their engagement separately.</p>
<p>I, an uninvited guest, represented Dr. Huang Jingwan, the social expert, after seeing Mr. Lang and explaining that Huang could not accompany him because the company was holding a shareholders' meeting, only saw many photographers such as Hu Boxiang, Bozhou and Huang Bohui's brothers, Zhang Zhenhou, Tang Seng, Ding Song, Zhu Shouren, Cai Renbao, Lu Zengqi and other gentlemen, as well as Shen Bao reporter Ge Gongzhen, Zhou Shoujuan, Shanghai cartoonist Zhang Guangyu and other gentlemen successively came to add color to this Xuyuan. Especially this kind of gathering is rare!</p>
<p>I heard that Mr. Lang's partner likes boxing and is good at horse riding, but on this day, with a light makeup and jade face, she lowered her head shyly and walked with a smile, supported by her sisters, Miss Peili. Like a weak boudoir girl, she arrived at the auditorium. Mr. Shen Zhuowu was publicly recommended as the master of ceremonies to hold the engagement ceremony temporarily formulated by the friends. After forcing the groom to report the origin of the marriage, the master of ceremonies sang loudly, "The bride and groom kiss!" Mr. Lang showed a shy state. Finally, he was pushed and pulled by several good friends, and kissed the bride. Finally, during the "bride shakes hands with the guests," Mr. Hu Bozhou introduced the guests one by one to shake hands. After the ceremony, everyone went to a large hall to eat tea and snacks. Fifty or sixty guests were at the same time scooping up glasses and dishes in a mess, talking, laughing, eating and drinking, each with their own posture. At this moment, several photographers took several rounds of film and several photos, and on a blank fan, Mr. Hu Boxiang started writing "On the auspicious day of May 25th, the 19th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Lang Jingshan and Ms. Lei Peizhi held a wedding ceremony in Xuyuan, Shanghai. It is worth celebrating that the couple will work together to create a new beginning. On that day, the weather was clear, and relatives and friends were all present. Mr. Jingshan held a fan with the same heart and asked the observers to sign their names, and ordered me to add a few words to the end of it." So the observers all signed their names as souvenirs. After the banquet, Mr. Lang stood up and gave a speech, inviting the guests and hosts to take a photo together to leave as a souvenir. So men and women, old and young, all gathered together on the green grass. A monk Tang (nickname), a master photographer who was indifferent to fame and wealth, took two photos before everyone dispersed happily. I heard that the wedding will be held at the Dahua Hotel on June 8th, and the time is set at 11 am, which will also be a unique event.</p>

<h3>Warmth in My Heart (203)</h3>
<p>Chapter Eleven: Verdant Adornments and Pearly Hairpins, a Beauty Returns Home; a Fine Scholar and Crimson Tent, a Famous Courtesan Marries into a Prominent Family</p>
<p>At that time, Zhu Feng also said that before a girl from the hall marries, before it's announced, it's like a mix of truth and falsehood, just like officials before their appointments are announced, they don't want people to know, as if afraid of divulging heavenly secrets. However, even though we live in the same place, it's not easy to know the real news. The reason is that this Third Young Master Wu also often comes here. Because of this matter, they held meetings in my room, so I knew. It is said that they bargained for one thousand dollars, because the eldest aunt insisted on five thousand dollars, but Third Young Master Wu was only willing to offer four thousand dollars, so it wasn't settled yet. Later, because there were too many ears and eyes, they didn't hold meetings in my room, and I didn't know. At that time, I asked Zhu Feng, "Does this Third Young Master Wu have money?" She said, "He has money. He also owns two pawnshops. I heard that my father was once a high-ranking official." I said, "Since he has money and is fond of her, he should just pay the extra thousand dollars." Zhu Feng said, "That's what I think too, but rich people probably don't think that way. They feel that giving five thousand when four thousand is enough is a big difference. They have their own way of seeing things and their own way of calculating prices. They think that paying more money is like being a fool, a sucker. They say that they don't care about paying a few more dollars, but the name of being a fool or a sucker is unacceptable. Once that name gets out, people will always treat them as fools or suckers." I asked, "How old is that Third Young Master Wu?" She said, "He's not very old, probably in his thirties. I heard he's also a scholar." I said, "That's very good." When it was time for the feast, I called Ruiyun over to sing. Looking at her, she seemed a bit unenthusiastic. Usually, she's always talking and laughing, but today she sat beside me without saying a word. At that time, I wanted to ask her, but then I thought I didn't need to. I hesitated for a long time, but I couldn't resist asking her because Zhu Feng's place was in Ruiyun's own home, so no one followed me. This was a good opportunity, so I softly asked her, "After the festival, I heard we're going to celebrate your wedding." Ruiyun opened her eyes wide when she heard this and said, "Who did you hear that from?" I smiled and said, "Don't ask me who I heard it from, just tell me if what I said is true or not." Ruiyun leaned close to my ear and said, "Come to my place in a little while, and I'll tell you. It's not good to talk about it here." I also asked her, "Do you think people don't know? Actually, everyone is talking about it. But some people say you're marrying someone named Zhao, and some say you're marrying someone named Wu. What's his surname?" Ruiyun shook her head and said, "That's not right, but there's some truth to it. Anyway, come to me in a little while, and I'll tell you." I said, "There are many people in your room, it's not good to talk there, right?" She said, "It doesn't matter. The eldest aunt is sick today and didn't come out."</p>

<h3>Gold Market in a Violent Storm</h3>
<p>Foreign Exchange Rates Rise Sharply, Hedging Is Greatly Affected</p>
<p>Rose and Fell by More Than Eight Taels, Resulting in a Rebound of 4.2 Taels</p>
<p>The Overall Market Was Highly Volatile: The rising trend in gold prices intensified yesterday, but the market was extremely volatile, with fluctuations of several taels being commonplace. This was due to people being bewildered and lacking direction, reacting to the atmosphere. Throughout the day, prices fluctuated by more than eight taels. However, new peaks were reached, breaking through the 530 tael barrier. The foreign exchange market was exceptionally strong, with posted rates shrinking by another half a point and repeatedly setting new records. There was some activity in the gold industry, but gold prices did not follow suit, with the difference becoming even more pronounced, resulting in hedging being severely affected. Transactions among industry players were chaotic and erratic, but the volume of large transactions was generally stable to avoid danger. The market opened high from the morning, mainly because of the shrinkage of large bars. The afternoon market continued to rise, maintaining a brisk pace. Subsequently, the market retreated from its peak, once surging to 536.5 taels. Buyers poured in, but it was short-lived, and the market quickly turned downward due to rumors of a proposed silver tax and the rejection of imports. The market panicked, and large holders aggressively sold, resulting in a violent and rapid decline of seven or eight taels, breaking through the 30 tael barrier and ultimately settling at 28 taels. However, it ended with slightly above 30 taels.</p>
<p>Opened High in the Morning and Continued to Rise, with British Silver Shrinking by One-Quarter and Silver Prices Decreasing by One-Half: The opening price for July gold was 2.4 yuan higher, at 528.8 yuan. The gross market price reached 31 yuan. The buying side was active. The initial sterling opening price shrank by 375, with the US dollar at 75. The price of gold for delivery in 7 days increased by 2.25 fen, then increased again to 31.4 yuan. Internal exchange rates were firm. Interbank trading of British gold for June was at 8 pence 375, and Mitsui absorbed it for 8 pence 5 in July. Subsequently, due to sales by small holders, it returned to around 29 taels. After 10 o'clock, it gradually rose, maintaining a steady pace, retreating only by one tael and then breaking through the 30 tael barrier. Chinese banks offered Japanese gold for September at 1 yuan, 1 qian, 9 fen, 125, and then offered British gold for September at 8 pence 4375. Later, interbank trading for December was at 8 pence 4375. The market was extremely tight, with prices surging by four or five taels. The afternoon closing price was 34.6 yuan.</p>
<p>Opened at a Peak of 36.5 Taels in the Afternoon: The market opened at a high price in the afternoon, reaching an unprecedented price of 536.5 yuan. Suddenly, the announcement of news that the customs had rejected the import of silver caused panic among industry players, who sold off their holdings en masse. Prices suddenly fell to 30 taels, and subsequently fluctuated by just over two taels. At 3 o'clock, the market calmed down, and prices were estimated at 32 taels and 7 or 8 qian. Half an hour later, the storm returned, and prices suddenly fell to 28 taels. Inquiries with industry players failed to reveal the truth. It was said that the market had risen from the ashes and was unpredictable. Exchange rates were also chaotic, but still tight, rising to 22.2 yuan at 4 o'clock, and then suddenly falling to 29.8 or 9 qian. At the 4:30 PM close, the price was 30.06 yuan, an increase of 4.2 yuan compared to the previous day. Overall, it was not as sharp as the rise in exchange rates.</p>
<p>Quoted prices were suppressed by 48 taels. A daily high of 36.5 taels and a low of 28 taels were recorded, a difference of 8.5 taels. The initial quoted price was 578.4 taels, but it was suppressed by 48 or 9 taels to 44 or 5 taels. The final quoted price was suppressed by 48 taels, an unprecedented situation. The book price was 35 taels, with a water supplement of 35 taels. The morning price for goods was 28.6 qian, and the afternoon closing price was 35.4 qian. The afternoon closing price was 36.1 qian, and the closing price was 30.03 qian.</p>
<p>Industry Trading Was Highly Unpredictable: The trading volume of Great Bing, Xing Heng, Tian Yu, Yong Yuan, Tai Yong Feng, Jun Jin, Fu Yu, Yi Yu, Yuan Xing, Yong Yuan Cheng, Yong Yuan Yu, and Yong Jun was recorded. Da De Cheng, Yuan Mao, Yong Wan Xing, Shun Li, Zhi Feng, Yong Heng Xing, and Fu Chang were mostly involved in both buying and selling. In the afternoon, Zhi Feng, Yong Bing, Xing Heng, etc., bought in, while Wan Xing, Shun Li, Fu Chang, Yuan Cheng, Yong Chun Yuan, Yong Tai Xing, etc., generally sold out. Each firm behaved differently, without any clear direction. The Dalian group sold 1,200 to 1,300 bars and bought 1,300 bars in the morning session, roughly breaking even. In the afternoon session, they sold over 3,000 bars and bought 800 to 900 bars. The Guangdong group maintained a balance of buying and selling in the morning, with a small amount of buying in the afternoon. However, there were no large transactions in the market.</p>

The domestic exchange market was particularly tight, with a large volume of imports being settled. However, gold prices did not rise sharply, with hedging differing by more than 50 taels. As a result, those who had previously sold sterling were now facing a great loss. Chinese speculators did not seek supplies in large quantities. Sterling transactions amounted to over 300,000 pounds, with Chinese merchants selling over 100,000 pounds. Mitsui, Mackinnon, Zhengjin, and Hua Bi absorbed tens of thousands of pounds. Zhongxing, Xingye, and Mitsui sold. Banks traded 100,000 pounds among themselves and also traded over 100,000 US dollars. Chinese merchants sold slightly, with Mackinnon absorbing. Japanese yen was bought for tens of thousands of yuan. North Korea, Sanlin, Zhongxing, and Mitsui sold. At the close of the market, sterling had shrunk by 875 compared to the previous day, the US dollar had shrunk by 1.8125, and the Japanese yen had risen by 6.375, a rare and strange rise. However, people were extremely apprehensive, and importers were severely affected.</p>
<p>The domestic market for sterling was exceptionally tight, with significant fluctuations. The June price in the morning was one shilling and eight pence 6875 for buying, and 75 for selling.

<h3>Silver Prices Repeatedly Set New Records</h3>
<p>Recent at 18 Pence, Long-Term at 18 Pence Upon Entry</p>

The recent contract decreased by 25 to 18 pence, and the long-term contract also decreased by 25, falling into the 18 pence barrier, to 17 pence 9375.

<h3>Public Debt Settlement of 18.7 Million</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities trading was suspended for the settlement of public debt due in May. The total settlement amount reached 18.7 million, a huge sum unprecedented in previous years. In addition to the transfer of over 10 million yuan completed on Tuesday, 8.55 million yuan was settled yesterday. Among them, customs duties and personnel reduction had the largest settlement amounts. Customs duties accounted for 4.9 million, and personnel reduction accounted for over 4.33 million. The others were mostly between 1 and 2 million. Since the securities exchange adopted bank custody receipts, this practice has now been implemented for the collection and disbursement of public debt spot goods, which is said to be quite convenient. The following is a breakdown of the public debt settlement and transfer amounts (in yuan):</p>
<p>Debt Type, Transfer Amount, Settlement Amount, Total Settlement</p>
<p>Regular Six, 1,100,000, 460,000, 1,960,000</p>
<p>Seven Years, 185,000, 255,000, 440,000</p>
<p>Continued Major, 370,000, 665,000, 1,055,000</p>

<p>Total, 10,150,000, 8,550,000, 18,700,000</p>
<h3>Handling of Public Debt Settlement</h3>
<p>Due to the volatile market prices, the trading volume of public debt this month was unusually high. The recent continuous price increases have resulted in many long positions not being unloaded, making this settlement particularly large. According to financial sources, the total amount of bank loans and money shop external lines absorbed by various stock companies reached 7 or 8 million, with personnel reduction accounting for a large amount of this. Therefore, the demand for agency fees and foreign exchange head fees yesterday was particularly high, all in preparation for absorbing these spot goods. According to investigations, banks accounted for over 4 million and money shops also had about 2 million. The rest was absorbed and stored by external lines and securities firms, waiting for a good price to sell.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Suffered from External Impact</h3>
<p>However, Raw Cotton is Firm, So It Will Not Fall</p>
<p>The Yarn Market is Turning Flat, but the Trend is Very Weak: Due to the many rumors and strong speculation in the financial world, the sales of yarn have become sluggish. Some is being sold off, but the Bao Li Chang Company has been restocking in large quantities. In addition, the sharp shrinkage of exchange rates has caused the price of raw cotton to rise sharply, pulling up the yarn market. Therefore, short sellers remain calm. Due to some bottom goods still having poor sales, the situation is temporarily stable.</p>
<p>Forward Yarn is Weak in the Near Term and Strong in the Long Term: Before the exchange market opened, those who were short-covering due to the tense situation with raw cotton poured in, and prices for each month rose by one or two qian, or two or three pieces. Due to the unfavorable news, the situation suddenly became weak, and the price fell again, resulting in a drop of one, two, or four qian for each month. In the afternoon, the situation was flat, and Li Chang purchased 2,200 bales in large quantities, while Company 50 sold 1,450 bales. The price of long-term contracts increased by 135 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 18,000 bales. The closing prices for each contract are recorded below:</p>
<p>Exchange Closing Price, Rise/Fall, Open Interest, August, 1558, Down 124, 4,850</p>
<p>June, 1545, Down 23, 1,700, June, 1567, Up 2, 1,150</p>
<p>July, 1549, 12, 4300, October, 1569, 12, 060</p>
<p>Sales of Spot Yarn are Still Good: The total amount purchased by various groups throughout the day was 1,320 bales. Fellow traders purchased 150 bales. The market was flat. Local groups purchased 425 bales. In addition, the Guangdong group purchased 335 bales, Yantai purchased 50 bales, Shantou purchased 55 bales, Sichuan purchased 250 bales, Xuzhou purchased 70 bales, and miscellaneous groups purchased 125 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Amid Soaring Gold Prices</h3>
<p>Foreign Cotton Prices are High, and Han Groups are Holding Tight</p>
<p>The Long-Brewing Cotton Market, Suppressed by Japanese Merchants, Has Now Been Revolving Due to Rising Gold Prices and Drastic Shrinkage of Exchange Rates. Foreign Cotton Prices are High, and Han Groups are Holding Tight, So Sellers are Showing Panic. The Situation is Very Sharp. However, Han Groups Have Continuously Released a Lot Recently. Most of Those Who Have Purchased Are Retail Investors Going Long. However, it is Difficult to Fall Sharply Because the Bottom Goods are Running Out. However, the Rising Price Trend is Too Fast and Actual Sales are Stagnant. It is Possible That Han Groups Selling May Have a Reaction.</p>
<p>Han Biao's Trend Remains Good: The Exchange's Han Biao's Opening Price in the Morning Was Sharp, and There Was a Lack of Buyers. As a Result, Each Rose by One Qian to Three and a Half Qian. The Rising Trend in the Afternoon Opening Remained Fierce. The Han Group Concluded Two or Three Rounds and Turned Loose, Falling by One Qian Five Fen. The Total Daily Turnover Statistics are 22,700 Dan. The Closing Price of Han Biao is Recorded on the Left</p>

<h3>Overseas Yarn and Cotton Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Only Cotton is Strong in the Near Term and Weak in the Long Term Among the Three Products</p>
<p>US Cotton Short Accounts Cover: Yesterday, US cotton was calm and firm due to poor forecasts in the west, and short-covering reduced sellers. Futures rose by 5 to 8 pounds, and spot goods were unchanged. UK cotton futures rose by 6 points and spot goods rose by 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods were unchanged. Indian cotton was weak due to speculators selling, with Pingguo Er rising by 3 rupees, Aomu La rising by 1 rupee, and Bai Luo Xi unchanged. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 27th).</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Continues to be Stable</h3>

<h3>The Market about to Expire</h3>
<p>Small and Medium-Sized Factories Prepare to Deliver Goods, So the Market Air is Sharply Falling Recently</p>
<p>After the opening of the powder market in the upper and lower afternoons of yesterday, each month showed a mutual rise and fall. In the early part of this month, it was still firm, but because there was no more competition from the selling side, because some of the small and medium-sized manufacturers had prepared to deliver the goods (yesterday, a thousand bags of recycled military ships were returned with two thousand bags of green wheat roots delivered), it was heard that there was still a stack of one or two thousand individual slips when officially delivered, and therefore the sharpness was much worse, and it could not be raised again. Because the manufacturers had a slight shipment in June, the market was tired of seeing the situation. The external lines below July were repeatedly purchasing again, and the market air was reversed and better, because the difference in degree from June was too huge, so people saw that the original intention was better. This month has ended, and it must be a market scene on the second of next month. If the weather is still good, or it will be a little more tiring. The result is that this month is smaller than the previous day and five cents. The seven cents is larger, one cent and the eighth month is larger, one cent and the ninth month is larger, one cent and the tenth month is larger, and two cents and a half are larger</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Rises with Gold Prices</h3>
<p>Factory Needs are Active, and Buyers are Enthusiastic</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market yesterday, it was initially in a flat image, followed by domestic manufacturers inquiring about foreign wheat, and the price of foreign wheat was quoted again, which was caused by the rise in gold, which caused the buyers' interest, and the market price was immediately seen to be on display. The next afternoon's step was good. The July was a three-minute point, and the October was two and six points in August. The spot goods were in good condition, so the mouth of Fuxin Fufeng was excellent, so even though the new wheat was not listed for sale one day, the cargo owners were like the original. The three or so thousand of Bengbu Suizhou Qingjiangpu wheat were opened out by the tong market for five or two yuan and a half. Shaoxing wheat was priced at five or two yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Sand White Sugar and Foreign Exchange Rise Together</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market production area telegraphic dispatch: Cuban spot sugar price remained at 1.375, New York futures sugar price for September was 1.48, a drop of four points compared to the previous dispatch; December was 1.59, a drop of two points; next year's March price was 1.66, also a drop of three points. Java spot sugar price was 9.75. July price was 9.375, with only June falling by .125 compared to the previous, and no increase otherwise. The association market allocated and traded Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white sugar, with the Dutch exchange rate shrinking. Sellers were even more reluctant to offer, with bids at 7 taels, 1 mace, and 5 candareens, and tightening. Initially, buyers were mostly waiting and watching, with slightly lower bids, but ultimately, there was no stock to be had, so the final transaction price was 7 taels, 1 mace, and 5 candareens, up 5 fen from the previous day, and the market shape felt rather charming. No. 20 medium sand white sugar traded less frequently at 7 taels and 0.05, and the market was also firm. Japanese sugar also followed suit, with N mark priced at 7 taels, 6 mace, and 2.5 candareens, YT mark at 7 taels, 5 mace, and 2.5 candareens, ER mark at 7 taels, 9 mace, J mark at 8 taels, 1 mace, and 5 candareens, and YP mark at 7 taels, 7 mace, and 5 candareens. Although transactions remained sporadic and sales were not yet smooth, the market shape was quite robust. The reason is attributed to the outflow of foreign exchange.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea New Factory Management Still Difficult to Progress</h3>
<p>Exchange Rate Fluctuations Remain Severe, European Firms Watch and Remain Still</p>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm silk market was even more difficult to progress. The fluctuation of foreign exchange was still severe, and it shrank again and again. European and American silk dispatches rarely turned to Shanghai. Various European firms watched and the market atmosphere was clear and firm. Yesterday, only Ganli and others took in 50 packs of new factory silk. The price was still firm.</p>
<h3>Wuxi New Cocoon Crop Failure, Price Increases</h3>
<p>Market Arrivals are Not Prosperous, Superior Cocoons are Few, Foreign Varieties Already at 80 Yuan</p>
<p>This year, silkworm ants in various cities and villages in Wuxi suffered from weather damage, and many were lost. The new cocoon crop failed, and the overall yield was less than 40%. The cocoon market has been open for four or five days, and arrivals on the market are not prosperous, and there are few superior cocoons. Various firms are not receiving goods smoothly and are vying to raise prices. In Luoshe, Yangshu Garden, Daqiangmen, and Qianzhou, Yuqi, Lishe and other places, the price of foreign varieties has been released to 80 yuan, and the price of local varieties is 64 or 5 yuan. The market still needs to see price increases. It is heard that a certain firm in the southern countryside has released foreign variety cocoons to 85 or 6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yixing Cocoon Production Not Bountiful</h3>
<p>Improved Variety Cocoons Still Thick, Cocoon Firms Release Prices and Compete to Purchase</p>
<p>This year, the amount of silkworm ants raised in various cities and villages in Yixing has been reduced, and the weather has been unfavorable. The cocoon production is poor. The cocoon market has been open for six days, and the amount of goods received is not smooth, but the improved variety cocoons are still thick. Various firms are releasing prices and competing to purchase. Yesterday, the highest price on the market had opened at 70 yuan, and local varieties at 60 yuan.</p>
<p>Green Tea: Dangerous Situation Arises</p>
<p>More Arrivals Daily, European Sales Immobile</p>
<p>Since the new tea came on the market, the amount of green tea produced by local firm tea factories is no less than 6,000 boxes. The amount of green tea arriving from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and Suian is no less than 10,000 boxes. In the past few weeks, the sales volume has been no more than 1,000 or 2,000 boxes. The new samples released recently have not been inquired about. According to news from foreigners, there are still more than 70,000 boxes of Zhenmei tea in the French Moroccan market, and there are also 20,000 boxes of green tea in Shanghai that have not been exported. In order to preserve their capital and clear their inventory, foreign tea merchants plan to postpone the new goods until August or September before starting business. Furthermore, the resumption of business by Russian firms is nowhere in sight. The future is truly dangerous.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Items</h3>
<p>Hakodate telegram: Due to demand and shortage, the price of kelp has fallen to 150 yuan per 100 stones.</p>
<p>Ningbo telegram: 47 more pieces of new rice were delivered yesterday and sold for 40 yuan and 5 cents.</p>
<p>Longkou vermicelli: 30 packs were opened yesterday at a price of 18 taels.</p>
<p>Arrivals of foreign rice are scarce. Jiangbei, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang routes and the stomach of this street are still healthy. The owners are selling firmly, so the price continues to rise by five or six cents.</p>
<p>Futures soybean cake is in the peak season for sales, and the market is very firm. Near-term prices rose a bit. The closing price for the end of May was 1 tael, 8 mace, and 3.5 candareens. Far-term prices for June and July also rose half a fen.</p>

<h3>George Bernard Shaw's Recent Conversation: Morley</h3>
<p>Exposure of His Strange Temperament</p>
<p>Wants to Be a Bandit</p>
<p>Writing a Play is Like Cultivating a Flower</p>
<p>An article by the Englishman J.L. Hudson, "Conversation with George Bernard Shaw," is translated as follows:</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw's talent and wealth are almost universally known, but he also went through a long period of hard work, spending nine years writing before achieving his current success. One day I went to visit him, and he said to me, "I had nine years of complete failure." Yes, as I thought about it, on his part, he might have felt it was more than nine years, because in the middle of our conversation, he told me he was already seventy-six years old, but according to many reference books, he is only seventy-three years old.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, he wrote a novel, "Immaturity," but never had the opportunity to publish it. This year, he is preparing to publish it, which is quite surprising. George Bernard Shaw is not an expert in novels. He is most proud of his plays, but why doesn't he write new plays? Although he feels he should write some, what he is doing now is the job of an office boy, collecting all his works to publish a complete collection. He says that only he, this office boy, can do these things, and others cannot help.</p>
<p>This conversation took place when I went to St. Lawrence (where George Bernard Shaw's country home is). Because he didn't show any dislike for me, I asked him naggingly, "Why didn't you ring the bell and call me up?" He said this very casually, sitting in a chair with his steel-rimmed glasses perched comfortably on his nose. He was wearing a brown corduroy jacket, and his snow-white beard was much fuller than I had imagined. His characteristic Irish accent was not as strong as it was on the phone.</p>
<p>"I think you might say I'm reckless," I interjected, "You're probably a bit reckless, but I've already come. It would have been easy for you not to see me. Otherwise, I'll observe you carefully." These words seemed to interest him. His gray eyes twinkled under his ragged eyebrows.</p>
<p>I asked him about his lifelong literary career. He said, "I have never changed direction in my life. I have always moved forward."</p>
<p>"When you were a child, did you already decide to become a writer? Did you know then that you would succeed as a playwright?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I never had that kind of thought. Don't talk nonsense. I originally wanted to be a painter, a bandit, or a car driver. We write articles because this is the only thing I can do, but in the first nine years, I was almost completely unsuccessful. I wrote five novels, none of which were worth a publisher's attention. At that time, George Meredith (1828-1909, British novelist and poet, who happened to be proofreading books for Chapman &amp; Hall) was one of the many people who rejected my works.</p>
<p>"I have forgotten that you once wrote novels." "Yes, no one knows what I was doing. In fact, from 1879 to 1883, I wrote the most novels. I wrote non-stop, like Trollope (1815-1882, British novelist). Some were never published at all. Later, a few were sent to socialist magazines, because the editor needed them when he was short of articles. I also learned from my experience writing novels how to write other articles."</p>
<p>"My novels have been pirated in the United States. Several editions have been published in the United States, but "Immaturity" will be printed directly from the original manuscript this year and published together with the complete collection I am currently preparing.</p>
<p>However, I still doubt whether George Bernard Shaw's personality has changed, because his career has clearly changed. His attitude towards me in the conversation was so humble, so sincere, and so pleasant, absolutely unlike the intense, generous, and revolutionary person that people generally imagine.</p>
<p>Later, he talked about his complete collection. He said, "If all the materials are collected, how great this book will be. It will be like Voltaire's (French playwright, 1694-1778) works, which can fill three bookshelves. Originally, my previous works did not necessarily have to be printed, but the characters I wrote are all from twenty years ago, so they now look like they were written at the time."</p>
<p>We talked about drama. I asked him if he meticulously planned the entire structure before starting to write. He said he didn't. "If you plan carefully before starting to write, it's like creating a saw that cuts curves. Although the person who makes it feels interested, the person who sees it only feels confused. When I started writing 'Saint Joan,' I didn't really understand its format. Also, when I started writing 'The Doctor's Dilemma,' although I wrote it casually, I knew I should say a few jokes about embryos. When writing 'Apple Cart,' I started wrong. I originally wanted to write about two sacrificial parties, but I could only write about the King and the Cabinet. I once wanted to delete the opening section, the conversation between the two secretaries, but after thinking carefully, if I really deleted it, the life of the whole play would be gone."</p>
<p>"You must admit that a play should grow like a flower," he continued. "You let it grow naturally, and then it will grow. It has to be like this for its structure to be complete. Its completeness is because no one has touched this flower."</p>
<p>I said, "I heard that you once went to listen to a sound film. Drliss is a talented person, but the main reason I went to see it was to check how their technology has progressed. But there is a problem, which is that what is already satisfactory on the stage becomes a strange joke when it goes on film."</p>
<p>At this point, he ran out the door with his bald head to instruct the chauffeur. He thought for a while and said to me, "I can give you a printed driving guide. I opened it and there were about 350 words. This book describes the route from London to his house in detail, like where to turn and where to go straight to get to George Bernard Shaw's door."</p>
<p>We said goodbye to him. He stood at the door and waved to me. I turned my head and looked at him, and saw only a tall figure, a colorful, soft tie fluttering on his chest, and the pair of old, thick wool socks and the pair of gray boots were still standing there.</p>

<h3>Business News</h3>
<p>The Jing'an Temple Road branch of the Shanghai Bank announced that the bank had not published a notice due to a lack of telephone lines, fearing that difficulties would arise in contacting the bank. However, many depositors have come after hearing about it. At present, the telephone has been installed, and all services are prompt and thoughtful. In addition to handling banking business, the branch also sells train tickets and boat tickets, and specially appoints the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the Wireless Radio General Station to set up a reporting office there. Since the publication of the notice, depositors have flocked to the bank and business has been extremely prosperous. The residents of the western district have said that it is convenient.</p>
<p>The Zhongling printing machine, a new product of Hanli Company, has been greatly improved after the improvement of the steam pressure, and the printing is extremely perfect. The purchases from all walks of life are more than the supply, but there is still a surgical relationship in the plate making. The company is sincerely afraid that the guest will not fully understand, resulting in imperfect printing. Every day, the deputy director of the business department, Chen Nansun, and Zheng Yingqi, are sent to the homes of various customers to inspect in detail whether the printing is perfect. If there is anything that is not fully understood, they will immediately direct it to ensure that the procedures are perfect and there is no problem before stopping. It is heard that all the customers who have purchased printing machines from the company recently are extremely happy.</p>
<p>The Lihua Company on Nanjing Road announced that during the discount period, the company will further cut prices on the most suitable gifts, such as various silk fabrics, canned biscuits, cigars, cigarettes, various national wines, cosmetics, fragrances, red and green fragrant teas, and Western clothing products, all of which are discounted. In addition, the gift voucher department specially prints five-color gift vouchers ranging from one yuan to one thousand yuan, which can be used to purchase goods at any department of the company at any time without any deduction. It is a very convenient and sincere gift.</p>
<p>Yanhua Restaurant, opposite Dan Gui No. 1 on Simalu, is also selling them.</p>
<p>The Shuangdao brand stinky water factory announced that Shuangdao brand stinky water has long been a leader in domestic hygiene products for its low price and high quality. The canned type used to be white iron cans with paper stickers. Shuangdao brand stinky water factory has been increasingly trusted by society and its business has been booming. Therefore, it has been improving the quality of its products to live up to the reputation of hygiene.</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>This summer, it has been changed to a finely printed paint hall, which is clean, beautiful, and stylish. Purchasers have a refreshing feeling. This reform is to commemorate the success of the product improvement. In addition, the factory issued the certificate for the first time by the Shanghai Chemical Experiment Room, a well-known chemical engineer, Mr. Baker Leclaire, to prove that it has the effect of sterilization and epidemic prevention. Since then, it has been more realistic and has been greatly improved. This year, the Industrial Goods Experiment Institute of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs proved that Shuangdao brand stinky water does have the ability to sterilize and gave it a chemical experiment certificate. If the product does not really have special effects, how could it achieve this? The general hygienists' belief in the product has become more firm, which goes without saying.</p>
<p>The Trust Department of the China National Products Bank announced that the government issues many types of treasury bonds, and the number of principal repayments each month is different. It takes a lot of effort to calculate the discounts. The Trust Department of the China National Products Bank on Simalu has compiled a "Market Price and Par Value Discount Table of Various Domestic Treasury Bonds". Readers can check the market price of various treasury bonds traded on the exchange every day and know the discount for a certain treasury bond. The current month and the next month can be compared at the same time. The compilation is excellent and the seekers are crowded.</p>
<h3>Medical News</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhou Wenxin, an employee of the Inland Tap Water Company, announced that his son, Zhou, was only three years old when he contracted a febrile disease. He sought medical treatment, but the illness became more severe day by day. Measles and rashes broke out, and there were convulsions and spasms. He consulted many doctors, all of whom diagnosed that he was incurable. He fainted for a whole day and night, and his hands and feet were ice-cold. He had no pulse. All the funeral arrangements were prepared. Fortunately, his colleague, Mr. Lu Mengqin, invited Dr. Qian Jiping, an expert in internal medicine at No. 1 Peifuli, Huanghe Road, behind the Slaughterhouse Company in the French Concession, to examine his wife. After Mr. Lu told Dr. Qian in detail about the child's condition and asked about the reason for the incurable disease, Dr. Qian carefully examined the child and said that he could still be saved. He instructed Mr. Zhou to remove the cotton clothes that the child had been wearing all his life, grind half a pill with boiling water, and pour it down the child's throat. Before long, he slowly woke up and was resurrected. Afterwards, he took several doses of decoction and was completely cured. Dr. Qian is a fellow villager of Mr. Lu Mengqin, so he knows Dr. Qian's resume in detail. It is said that Dr. Qian is the son of Wang Xiaoyuan, a famous doctor in Yushan, and a highly respected student of Mr. Ruoshan. He has studied medicine extensively and has a deep understanding of the past. Since he started practicing medicine, he has saved countless lives. Everyone calls him the reincarnation of Zhongjing in the field of typhoid fever. Now, seeing this event, it is truly not an exaggeration. Therefore, I specially record it so that patients can choose a doctor for treatment and avoid being misled by incompetent doctors.</p>
<p>The famous doctor Wang Cheng has long been renowned in Lanxi, eastern Zhejiang. Last year, he came to Shanghai to attend the National Federation of Chinese Medicine Organizations. His fellow villagers in Shanghai, who knew of Mr. Wang's rich experience, immediately retained him in Shanghai to practice medicine. He now has a clinic at No. 48 Ximenli, Ximen Road, in the French Concession. The consultation fee is one yuan, and the home visit fee is four yuan. The poor and sick are not charged.</p>
<p>The famous doctor Ms. Shi Feibi passed away at her home in Shanghai at 2:00 PM yesterday. Ms. Shi was a medical doctor from Johns Hopkins University in the United States. After returning to China, she served as the director of the Jiujiang Women's and Children's Hospital and the director of the Shanghai Bethel Hospital for more than ten years. She saved hundreds of thousands of lives, overworked herself, and died at the age of only forty. It is heard that the funeral will be held at Bethel Hospital at 3:00 PM on the 31st of this month.</p>
<p>Medical Doctor Fei Kunian announced that he graduated from the University of Würzburg and the University of Giessen in Germany and returned to China at the end of March this year. He is currently setting up a clinic at No. 9 Parker Road, at the intersection of Baike Road in this city. He has been a doctor in Berlin, Hamburg, Giessen, and Vienna, Austria, for many years and has rich experience. He specializes in internal and surgical medicine, as well as obstetrics, gynecology, venereal diseases, and dermatology. He has more experience in the treatment of lung diseases and new electrotherapy.</p>

<h3>Uncle Vanya Still Often</h3>
<p>One of Chekhov's Five Great Plays</p>
<p>The "Xin You" Drama Troupe to Revive Performances on the 31st</p>
<p>The Background of This Play</p>
<p>Is set in a remote village in Russia at the end of the 19th century, before the Russian Revolution. The main character in this play is not Vanya (Uncle Vanya), nor Sonya, nor Doctor Astrov, nor Helena. It is the melancholy and oppressive atmosphere of a sparsely populated, isolated place.</p>
<p>The content of this play has no particular plot, but rather gathers fragments of facts to reflect the spirit of that era.</p>
<p>The characters are:</p>
<p>Vanya, who is sorrowful and angry.</p>
<p>Doctor Astrov, who is troubled by the uncultured Russian life.</p>
<p>Professor Serebryakov, who is down on his luck.</p>
<p>The gentle Sonya, who endures hardship.</p>
<p>Helena, the Professor’s wife, who suffers torment.</p>
<p>Sonya in "Uncle Vanya".</p>
<p>An ambivalent character, kind-hearted but with a bad fate.</p>
<p>The quiet old nanny.</p>
<p>The pedantic and out-of-touch old Mrs. Voinitskaya, always with a book in her hands.</p>
<p>In short, they are all wounded little birds struggling in desolation and loneliness.</p>
<p>A group of people lives on an estate in a certain village, passing their days in a muddled fashion, though depressed, yet peaceful. Suddenly, the owner of the estate, a university professor, returns from the city after retirement, thus breaking the silence. The professor is in a bad mood, suffering from gout, and wants everyone to be busy for him. His wife, Helena, dazzles many men with her beauty. Thus, the life on the estate seems to be overturned. Vanya, the brother of the professor's first wife, who has always managed the estate for him, now realizes that he has been trampled upon and recognizes his former foolishness, so he quarrels with the professor. Because of various pressures, the professor and his wife have to leave the village. After the storm passes, the estate returns to silence. The facts of this play are simply this.</p>
<p>The author's truth is spoken through the mouths of Doctor Astrov, Sonya, and Vanya. He says, "I work diligently. No one else in this village works as diligently as I do. If a thousand years later mankind can be happy, then I will have contributed a little to their happiness. We will have to wait for our descendants, perhaps they will find a way to happiness." He also says, "Man has the innate intelligence and creative power to expand the world left by God." He is working hard and yearning in this way. Sonya buries herself in work and does not complain. When her uncle says to her, "I am so sad, will you know how sad I am?" she replies, "What can we do? We must live our lives. We must go on. We must live through the long days and long nights that follow. We must patiently endure the tribulations destined in our fate. We must seize the present, and in the future, when we are old, we will still have to work hard for others without stopping. When our time comes, we will die quietly." She has an affirmative attitude towards life. She feels that the comforter of life's pain is not passive decadence but active work. This courageous attitude and spirit of dedication are the main theme of the whole play.</p>
<p>Remember that Tolstoy criticized him, saying, "Chekhov's writing has its own unique style, like that of an Impressionist writer. His writing is like casually picking up colors from around him and applying them. The lines he paints seem to have no connection with each other, but when you step back a little, you will feel an amazing touch and create an excellent picture. It has such an interesting flavor." Such a picture is unfolded before the public in the Central Auditorium of Shanghai (the venue for the Xin You Drama Troupe's performance).</p>
<h3>Great China University to Add Women's Kindergarten Normal School</h3>
<p>The authorities of Great China University recently felt the importance of early childhood education in China and the lack of kindergarten teachers. The 73rd school affairs meeting decided to add a women's kindergarten normal school in the new campus from the next semester. Experts in early childhood education will be hired as professors to train kindergarten teacher talents to meet domestic needs. They are now actively preparing and have elected Ou Yuanhuai, Vice President of the University, Lu Jizeng, Dean of Academic Affairs, Chen Xuanshan, Dean of the School of Education, Huang Jingsi, Director of the Higher Normal Department, and Professor Dong Renjian as preparatory committee members for the kindergarten normal school.

<h3>Overview of Geological Research in China</h3>
<p>Ye Liangfu, Researcher at the Institute of Geology, Academia Sinica</p>
<p>Before I talk about the overview of geological research in China, I must first explain what kind of science geology is and whether we should study it.</p>
<p>At the end of the 18th century, some scholars in Europe noticed the arrangement and growth of various rock layers, and the biological remains in the rock</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>layers, such as shells. After describing, recording, comparing, and investigating their causes, the research became detailed and the knowledge became systematic, and a science specializing in the history of the earth and the changes of organisms on the earth was successfully established, called geology. Therefore, geology is only about one hundred and fifty years old.</p>
<p>Chinese people did not pay attention to science at first, but now they know that they should study science. Because the country is poor, it cannot set up many research institutions, or it is easy or difficult to seek personal affairs. You have to ask whether this science is useful or useless. Speaking of this, judging from the words "geology," it is conceivable that this is a science that is very related to mining, agriculture, civil engineering, and chemical engineering. However, we cannot just take the scope of application as sufficient, because no matter what kind of science, to thoroughly solve the application problems related to it, we must have in-depth knowledge and skills of this science. Therefore, the goal of studying geology in China is still to study the geological history of China, which can include everything. On the one hand, it can be applied to a lifelong career, and on the other hand, it can increase the culture of the world.</p>
<p>Since foreigners came to China to study geology for sixty-four years, there have often been people, and now there are more. We will not talk about them for the time being. As for the Chinese people themselves, they only started to formally study geology from the fifth year of the Republic of China. Now I will roughly talk about the three aspects of research institutions, practical contributions, and research talents.</p>
<p>(1) Research Institutions</p>
<p>In the 15th year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce of the Beijing government established a geological survey bureau, which was later changed to an institute. Every spring and winter, people were sent out to investigate geology. At first, the focus was on coal and iron mines, and later the focus was on all aspects of geology and the statistics of mineral production and mining. It also prepared to compile and publish a national geological map with a scale of 1:1,000,000, divided into sheets, each covering 6 degrees of longitude and 4 degrees of latitude. Until now, a total of three sheets have been published. The initial funding was set at 3,000 to 5,000 yuan per month. Since it was incorporated into the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining of the National Government, it was planned to increase it to 10,000 yuan, but it has not been fully received for more than ten years. All rely on the efforts of the staff and the assistance of major mining companies and the China Education and Culture Foundation Committee. In addition to geological maps, a total of 13 issues of reports and 13 special reports have been published, as well as 40 volumes of Paleontologia Sinica. Geologists all over the world use this book, Paleontologia Sinica. Many of the authors of each book are famous foreign scholars, so the reputation is very good.</p>
<p>In the 8th year of the Republic of China, the Jiangsu Industrial Department hired two experts to investigate the geology and mineral resources of the province for about three years, and produced a 1:500,000 full map, four 1:250,000 partial maps, and one report.</p>
<p>In the 11th year of the Republic of China, the Geological Society of China was established. Most of the Chinese geologists and foreign geologists in China are members. This is an academic discussion institution and has no work of its own. However, a volume of the journal is published every year, and the articles sent by members are printed in it. Most of them are important and novel contributions. At the same time, the professors and students of the Department of Geology of Peking University often publish research results. In the 15th year of the Republic of China, Hunan established a geological survey institute. Although the funding was limited, the results were still good. So far, a total of 8 reports have been published.</p>
<p>In the 16th year, the Guangdong-Guangxi Geological Survey Institute was established with a monthly funding of 10,000 yuan. Unfortunately, the climate in Guangdong is humid and hot, and the area is unstable, making it relatively difficult to recruit talents. Theoretically, this geological survey institute is very important, because the geology of the southwest is too unclear, and it is very difficult for people from other places to be sent there. Since the establishment of the institute, the geology of Guangdong and Guangxi has gradually become clear. They have published more than 20 temporary reports, 4 special reports, and the second volume of the official annual report. The annual report has been sent to the press and will be available soon.</p>
<p>Since the 17th year, the Institute of Geology of Academia Sinica has been established, and the strength of geological research in China has increased. However, the operating policy of this institute is not the same as that of the national or provincial geological survey institutes. They want to determine the topic according to the strengths of the researchers and do some detailed research. All the research methods and academic ideals that European and American scholars have recently pursued should be thoroughly understood and similar research should be done. Because only three years have passed since its establishment, much time has been spent on preparation, so there are not many results. Although 8 volumes of collected works have been published, they have contributed to increasing domestic geological knowledge, but they are not satisfied with such work.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also the Mineral Resources Survey Institute of the Zhejiang Construction Department and the Jiangxi Geological Survey Institute, which are mostly in their infancy (Henan also established a geological survey institute). In short, in the past, the achievements of geological research in China can be said to be concentrated in Beiping. People who travel to Beiping should visit their geological exhibition hall.</p>
