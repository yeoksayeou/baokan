<p>馬來由擬限制膠産</p>
<h3>荷屬不予同意</h3>
<p>金文泰赴荷屬之經過情形</p>
<p>荷屬不能合作之四大理由</p>
<p>馬來由華商華工益陷悲境</p>
<p>南洋特訊自五月停割樹膠一月結果不特未能挽起膠價而出産反見增多價格反以暴跌馬來由膠商奔走呼號力主懇請産膠地之政府採取一致行動制定法例實行强迫限制生産以圖挽救膠業之危機七月十九日馬來由東亞人種植總會開特别大會議定二大原則（一）請政府通過法例限制樹膠出産規定某某時期爲停割時期或再行引用舊時之「史蒂芬遜」限制計劃而略加改良但此種法例須待荷屬東印度及錫蘭兩政府頒佈同樣效力之法例後方可實行（二）請求政府與荷屬東印度錫蘭及其他有樹膠出産之英屬政府一齊進行在若干年間不許發給新地爲種植樹膠之用自此二大原則公佈後馬來由各地膠商如新嘉坡·柔佛·怡保等均願擁護故請政府限制樹膠生産停止發給種膠新地實馬來膠商目睹膠業凋敝擬運用政治力量以挽殘局之唯一要求也蓋此項主張得馬來由樹膠墾植協會同意認爲藉此可以節减樹膠之生産額使膠價得以恢復原狀惟馬來由膠商雖要求政府限制生産但若荷屬政府不予同意則馬來由單獨進行亦難生效現在限制呼聲雖已揚溢馬來由而荷屬膠商毫未有具體表示則此項主張能否得荷屬政府之同意尙一疑問也</p>
<p>八月二十日馬來由東亞種植總會在吉隆坡開各色人聯合會議（不論何種何國膠商有膠園即可列席）對請荷政府同意限制引起極大之論辯種植總會會長陳禎祿且有「荷屬不同意限制吾人必與之拚命」之憤語可知其爭辯之烈矣八月二十五日海峽殖民地立法會議中主張限制者與反對者又起劇烈之爭辯坡督金文泰則表示須俟赴荷得悉荷屬政府態度後方可定救濟樹膠政策因坡督定於八月二十七赴荷故也</p>
<p>八月二十七日晨七時新嘉坡總督金文泰爵士偕其私人秘書海特氏乘飛機離星洲飛赴爪哇至十時五十三分抵巨港稍休息即飛赴巴達維亞將近爪哇時荷屬軍用飛機六架騰空歡迎下午二時三十分抵巴城即晚與荷督各要人宴會二十八日與荷屬東印度總督格黎夫談論限制樹膠事宜并用長途電話（係前年建築）與英國倫敦殖民大臣巴斯菲爾爵士談論此次赴荷屬及商洽樹膠事件後游覽荷屬各名勝至二日飛返星洲</p>
<p>金文泰旣以赴荷探詢東印度對限制樹膠之意見自任并信於回叻時即有良策公佈故引起各方人士之注意良以膠業久在病中莫不盻望得一良方以謀療治乃不料金督返叻後並不即將消息宣佈人心已惶惑不安遲至六日始由輔政司公署秘書巴特利氏用書函答復種植總會及樹膠生産公會表示政府不干涉膠業於是膠商乃大失望矣其函略云「目前之所需要者爲應採取經濟法則之舉動以鞏固樹膠價格總督奉行政局之諭認到在馬來由採取單獨之行動不惟無補於實際抑且將使此種情勢愈趨於惡劣因此之故總督决定應聽經濟法則之自然途徑始克使鞏固樹膠價格之希望得奏成功則樹膠事業將進於就範時期而供求兩方將達於彼此幾近相等之地位」其所謂聽經濟法則之自然途徑以鞏固樹膠價格者即不干涉樹膠事業繁華衰敗任其自然而已換言之即荷屬不同意限制樹膠生産馬來由膠商應自謀救濟耳夫世界存膠旣將達五十萬噸而全世界用膠毎月僅六萬三千五百噸屯積之膠旣没法銷售新産之膠又無法限制生産愈多屯積愈大膠價愈跌此必然之理也當此危機其資本宏大之樹膠園主固尙可勉力維持而小資本膠園則在在有破産之慮際此膠價狂跌之時胼手胝足得有數百畝膠園之華僑其苦况更不堪設想矣（未完）</p>

<h3>上海絹絲廠勞資糾紛</h3>
<p>社會局昨日調解無結果</p>
<p>曹家渡日商上海絹絲廠開設以來已二十餘年營業甚爲發達廠務亦逐步展進乃本月十七日該廠勞資雙方忽發生爭端致釀成怠工風潮迭經黨政機關從事調解資方態度均屬强硬異常致迄難接近旋　於决裂最近則資方自知停業之非計故自行致函社會局請重行調解當由社會局召集雙方談話並經一度調解昨日下午二時又召集第二次調解會義茲特彙誌於後</p>
<p>糾紛原因此次該廠勞資雙方糾紛之起因係因該廠無故將工人工資减低事先亦未經黨政兩方之批准故該廠女工羣表示不服謂際此生活程度日益高昻之秋别家工廠俱均加給工資該廠非惟不加反欲减低並查數年以來該廠减低工資已有四次最初毎一疋之工資爲一元一角今則已經减爲三角六分七工人輩均隠忍不言茲復欲從三角六分七内减去十之四祗得二角二分之數乃羣起表示反對而廠方則態度强硬始終無退步之表示</p>
<p>事後調解該廠勞資雙方旣有糾紛發生該處六區公安局長任履平·恐事端擴大迭次召集雙方調解均不就緒女工等則自上月十七日起一致表示怠工旋社會局方面亦派員前往調解因資方絲毫無誠意之表示故此項糾紛成爲懸案惟今則資方自行覺悟故再由市社會局續行調解以期早日解决</p>
<p>勞方條件至於勞方此次風潮純爲資方無故减低工資所致故認爲責任方面應由資方負担其所提條件（一）恨復原有毎疋工資之數目（二）罷工期内工資照給（三）不得無故開除工人（四）放工以前應許盥洗（五）不得濫罰工資（六）補足一月已扣之工資（七）允許組織工會（八）原料低劣之貨品工資須照毎日工發給（九）開除走狗陳秀珍</p>
<p>出席人員昨日出席之人員行政官署方面爲社會局徐直公安局代表王或賢·記錄王志欽·勞方代表唐金英·顧金妹·朱　英·王茂貞·資方代表日人天野　八十郋井上新平翻譯華人陳仁林</p>
<p>調解情形昨日調解係用隔别詢問方法先由市兩局代表向資方反覆開導資方允將原减工資十之四内增加三之一對於其他各條如罷工期内工資照給等則堅决不允並聲明如勞方必須增加則寗可聽其關廠</p>
<p>勞方讓步官方兩代表當將資方態度向勞方申說勞方則堅持前議惟對於减低工資則表示讓步惟至少仍須毎疋三角否則堅持到底决不爲資方所屈伏</p>
<p>會議結果雙方態度旣如是不能接近官方兩代表乃鄭重宣告兩方旣如是不能接近則勢有提交市府仲裁乃日人一聞此言則又聲明願重行攷慮終則由日人自願召集勞方代表直接討論而後呈報社會局並向社會局代表詢問關廠之如何辦法當由徐君告以如欲關廠則須依照工會法則視工人任職年月之多少一年應給退職金一月十年以上毎一年爲半月如係暫時停閉則至多不得過兩月並須發給毎一工人三之一之工資至於廠方向勞力直接譚判則工人代表須有七十人以上方爲合法終由資方約以星期一予以答覆始行散去</p>

<p>第一盤比賽原定二時半開始因林寶華到場較遲開始接戰已鐘鳴三下時林匆匆到場未能舒適筋骨以致表演大爲減色而邱飛海竟亦受其影響連失三盤觀衆大爲不滿幸自此以後精神略振協力工作不遺餘力瞬息間亦得三局造成平手此後雙方競形吃緊美軍先聲奪人國軍步武於後相提並進各不相讓自五比五後林之攔網奇巧百出邱則應接後方陣線十分鞏固使對方無懈可擊結果林邱以七比五勝</p>
<p>第二盤是盤起林邱恢復原色各種擊法俱有得心應手之妙反見對手愴惶失措失分頻呈一刹那間連勝四局史卜二人努力反攻奪回一局林邱繼續又勝二局結果以六比一再勝</p>
<p>第三盤林邱先勝首局而後史卜以二比一占優林邱加上兩局又以三比二占優史卜国力圖掙扎僅追上一局結果林邱以六比三勝結果遵成三比零林邱奪得錦標旋由草地網球會長霍華特給奬兩只大銀分贈於林邱保存一年刻兩人之姓名於上作有歷史上之紀念</p>

<h3>長沙浩刧雜記（中）</h3>
<p>— 唳天</p>
<p>記得草潮門某街有一個開糖坊的兩父子營業有年被人告密說他家財甚富紅軍司及部派人將這位父親捉去勒索一萬二千元這位兒子急得無法可設計算若能將舖面令田産全部變賣亦祗能得四千餘元且當時誰又要買這些不動産於是乎哭哭啼啼的跑到紅軍司令部去說明自願將全部財産交來求將父親放歸紅軍不肯他竟自願以身贖其父親紅軍始終不肯過了兩天將這位六十幾歲的老頭子殺了</p>
<p>梭鏢隊殺人更爲兇惡因爲他們並不是痛痛快快的一下子將人殺死而是隨隨便便的刺入幾梭鏢梭鏢又有幾種不同的形狀其中最利害的要算帶鈎的梭鏢了這種梭鏢刺進了胸腹部將心肝五臟都扯了出來可憐頭在頸上一時那裡會斷氣凡被用梭鏢殺的至少要拖延到數小時以至十幾點鐘才死中山馬路上就是這樣的殺死一個抱着小孩子的中年婦人小孩子被梭鏢隊搶去了這位婦人在馬路上痛呌了半日方才氣絶</p>
<p>凡退職的文武官員以及稍有財産的人們都在被搜殺之列這種搜殺除一些很著名的外就要靠地痞流氓的告密了其中尋仇報復的固然是不少但無辜而全家被抄殺的更多最使人不解的恐怕要算湖南大名鼎鼎的某公館了他這所房子很大并且是人人皆知的而這次共匪不獨没有焚刦這所唯一的大公館而且大門上貼了一張告示「如有人燒刼此屋者斬紅軍第三軍」</p>

<h3>糧食米市跌風稍戢</h3>
<p>各價微小兩三角</p>
<p>閘北昨日到船三十餘號走銷已漸活緣各店胃因産訉轉定及米客虧耗太鉅因此落手添購惟進數不多防市價再大跌也故市上買氣雖活而價則仍有修削但大勢已覺稍定計西新粳頂貨疲去角半開出十六元一二角普通小去兩三角大盤祗十五元三四角東新粳亦小二角特頂十四元七角浦東市高十四元三角交易寥寥羊尖開十二元半杜尖十二元八角以上均續小兩三角而客尖見到特頂貨數百石行情開十一元半市高仍祗十元零八角埠尖高做十二元市無上落茲照收市情形似乎有趨定之態白元亦告平穏開十七元五六角</p>

<h3>近期粉尙屬俏麗</h3>
<p>昨日粉市開市後近遠各月份均居盤旋之局惟現粉尙有北方零戸去化而某大廠亦有自裝北方出售故本月份市面亦被帶好更因各廠多數减車出數不多而某廠又有軋空痕跡以致本月份逐盤上漲收市價大至二兩四錢七分二五反比前日收市價較大一分二五十月份亦帶起五厘遠期初亦帶好繼被廠方套售又復回落結果十一月·正·二月均與前日收市相同十二月反小二五云</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Turkish Cabinet</h3>
<p>Since its rise, Turkey has eliminated the oppression of the powers and worked hard on domestic affairs. The reason why it has been able to proceed smoothly and achieve results that are praised by the world is that under the leadership of President Kemal, the members of parliament all belong to the Nationalist Party and have consistent political views, so they can operate freely. Unexpectedly, a New Liberal Party was organized in this parliament with one-party rule, and at the beginning of the organization, it was said that it had obtained Kemal's support, and it was said that Prime Minister Ismet had lost the president's trust and the cabinet was about to shake. Many commentators also worried that the Turkish political situation would become troublesome from now on. Now that Ismet has submitted his resignation, according to the situation, the responsibility of forming a cabinet should naturally be entrusted to Bai, the leader of the newly formed opposition party. However, Kemal insisted on entrusting it to Ismet and ordered him to reorganize the new cabinet. The inside story is mysterious and incomprehensible. If the Turkish president supports the policies of the new party, why would he still order the former prime minister to form a cabinet and show an unwillingness to yield? If he does not support the policies of the new party, why would he tacitly agree with the new party to secretly force the former prime minister to resign? The saying has been repeatedly seen in newspapers. Or it is said that the Turkish president firmly supports the new party's cabinet formation, but for the sake of appeasing the old party and the face of the former prime minister, he will first order a reorganization to test it. If that is the case, although Ismet has reorganized the new cabinet today, the result may still not be able to stabilize the political situation. Why? This time it is called a reorganization, but in fact all the important officials are still preserved. The opposing new party has only won a few minor seats and has not been able to develop its policies. Isn't the reorganization a superfluous move? Therefore, I say that the solution to the Turkish political situation will definitely not be so simple, and the freely operating Turkish president may be trapped in thorns from now on.</p>

<h3>Minister of Interior Formulated Bandit Suppression and Communist Eradication Measures</h3>

He has specially drafted measures to suppress bandits and eradicate communism on a symptomatic basis and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for review and implementation. The measures are: (1) The power of the communists in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces is so great that it can shake the overall situation. The Central Government should appoint senior officials to lead a large army to be responsible for suppressing them. (2) The communists appear and disappear unpredictably and often break out and collapse. The responsible officials of each province should direct the defense army to cooperate in encircling and suppressing them without being confined to the established ideas of this territory and that boundary. (3) The communists should be encircled and suppressed without stopping until they are completely annihilated, and they should not be allowed to escape or slip through the net. (4) The nature of bandits is constantly changing. Reorganizing the bandits is extremely dangerous. A clear order should be issued to prohibit reorganization and adopt only pacification to achieve permanent peace. (5) Vigorously implement village cleansing, compile household registrations, and obtain joint liability bonds to make it impossible for bandits and communists to find a place to hide. Anyone who protects bandits or shields bandits will be treated the same as bandits. (6) Rewards and punishments must be clear. Any territorial officials who are responsible for defending the city and the city is captured by the bandits, or the army's suppression of the bandits is ineffective, or there is a situation of condoning the bandits, will be severely punished. Those who have made outstanding achievements in handling village cleansing and quickly annihilated the bandits to stabilize the local area should be rewarded. Other performance evaluation regulations for the army and county magistrates in investigating and arresting bandits must be strictly implemented. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Inside Story of Piłsudski's Return to Power</h3>
<p>Economic Conditions May Improve</p>
<p>A Last Gamble to Predict Fate</p>
<p>Opposition Leader Arrested at the Border</p>
<p>Silesian Parliament Ordered to Dissolve</p>
<p>Warsaw - General Piłsudski's return to power was initially regarded as peculiar by various parties. According to reliable sources, Piłsudski's public return as Prime Minister was actually due to the advice of his close followers. For the past year and a half, Poland's economic situation has been deteriorating, reaching its peak at present. Piłsudski and his confidants believe that there will be a turning point and gradual improvement from now on. Piłsudski has always been a powerful figure since Poland's founding because of his familiarity with all aspects of politics. If his economic advisors believed that the country's situation would continue to deteriorate, he would definitely not take office. In other words, Piłsudski's rise to power this time is a gamble, betting everything on the improvement of the economic situation in the future. If so, in the next general election, Piłsudski's followers will be able to declare to the public that since Piłsudski overthrew the old cabinet and personally took power, the country has been making steady progress, and his influence will naturally increase. Therefore, it is believed that the new government will strive to borrow foreign debt, even if it is not a large amount, to implement tax cuts before the general election in order to win the favor of general merchants. At the same time, it is hoped that the Eastern European Farmers' Conference currently being held in Warsaw will at least provide some assistance to Poland's agriculture. Poland's economic situation often improves during the agricultural season, and Piłsudski's appearance at this time is probably due to this. According to neutral observations, the government will wage a desperate battle with the opposition party in the next general election. To hope for success, it will find ways to change the election law to favor those who lean towards Piłsudski's party. However, judging from the current situation, no matter what unconstitutional methods the government uses to suppress the opposition party, it will ultimately be difficult to obtain an absolute majority in parliament.</p>

<p>Malaya Plans to Restrict Rubber Production</p>
<h3>Dutch Possessions Do Not Agree</h3>
<p>Kimberley's Visit to the Dutch Possessions</p>
<p>Four Major Reasons for Dutch Inability to Cooperate</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants and Workers in Malaya Fall into Misery</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Nanyang - Since the one-month rubber tapping suspension in May, not only has it failed to raise rubber prices, but production has increased and prices have plummeted. Rubber merchants in Malaya have been appealing for the governments of rubber-producing regions to take concerted action and enact laws to implement mandatory production restrictions in order to save the rubber industry from crisis. On July 19th, the Malayan East Asian Planters Association held a special general meeting and decided on two major principles: (1) Request the government to pass legislation to restrict rubber production, stipulating a certain period as a suspension period, or to re-apply the old "Stevenson" restriction plan with slight improvements, but such legislation must be implemented only after the governments of the Dutch East Indies and Ceylon have promulgated similarly effective laws. (2) Request the government to work with the Dutch East Indies, Ceylon, and other British territories that produce rubber to prohibit the issuance of new land for rubber planting for several years. Since the announcement of these two major principles, rubber merchants in various parts of Malaya, such as Singapore, Johor, and Ipoh, have been willing to support them. Therefore, requesting the government to restrict rubber production and stop issuing new land for rubber planting is the only request of Malayan rubber merchants who have witnessed the decline of the rubber industry and intend to use political power to salvage the situation. This proposal has been agreed upon by the Malayan Rubber Planters Association, which believes that it can reduce rubber production and restore rubber prices to their original state. However, although Malayan rubber merchants have requested the government to restrict production, if the Dutch government does not agree, it will be difficult for Malaya to proceed alone. Although the call for restrictions has spread throughout Malaya, Dutch rubber merchants have not made any concrete expressions, so it is still questionable whether this proposal will be agreed upon by the Dutch government.</p>
<p>On August 20th, the Malayan East Asian Planters Association held a joint meeting of all races (rubber merchants of any race or country who own rubber plantations could attend) in Kuala Lumpur. The issue of asking the Dutch government to agree to restrictions caused great debate. Chen Zhenlu, the president of the Planters Association, even uttered the angry words, "If the Dutch possessions do not agree to restrictions, we will fight them to the death!" It can be seen how fierce the debate was. On August 25th, in the Straits Settlements Legislative Council, those who advocated restrictions and those who opposed them engaged in another fierce debate. Governor Clementi stated that he would have to wait until he went to the Netherlands to learn about the attitude of the Dutch government before he could determine the rubber relief policy, because Governor Clementi was scheduled to go to the Netherlands on August 27th.</p>
<p>At 7:00 AM on August 27th, Singapore Governor Sir Cecil Clementi and his private secretary, Mr. Height, left Singapore by plane and flew to Java. At 10:53 AM, they arrived in Palembang. After a short rest, they flew to Batavia. As they approached Java, six Dutch military aircraft took off to welcome them. At 2:30 PM, they arrived in Batavia and attended a banquet with Dutch officials that evening. On the 28th, they discussed rubber restrictions with Dutch East Indies Governor-General Graf, and used a long-distance telephone (built last year) to talk with British Colonial Secretary Lord Passfield about this visit to the Dutch possessions and rubber negotiations. Afterwards, they toured various scenic spots in the Dutch possessions and flew back to Singapore on the 2nd.</p>
<p>Clementi took it upon himself to inquire about the Dutch East Indies' opinion on rubber restrictions and believed that he would have good strategies to announce upon his return to Singapore, which attracted the attention of various people. Because the rubber industry had been ill for a long time, everyone hoped to get a good prescription to treat it. However, to everyone's surprise, Governor Clementi did not immediately announce the news after returning to Singapore, and people were already anxious. It was not until the 6th that Mr. Batley, the secretary of the Colonial Secretary's Office, replied to the Planters Association and the Rubber Producers Association by letter, stating that the government would not interfere in the rubber industry. As a result, rubber merchants were greatly disappointed. The letter stated in part, "What is needed at present is to take actions based on economic principles to consolidate rubber prices. The Governor, on the advice of the Executive Council, believes that taking unilateral action in Malaya will not only not help the actual situation, but will also make the situation worse. Therefore, the Governor has decided to listen to the natural path of economic principles in order to make the hope of consolidating rubber prices a success, so that the rubber industry will enter a conformable period and supply and demand will reach a nearly equal level." What he meant by listening to the natural path of economic principles to consolidate rubber prices was that he would not interfere in the prosperity and decline of the rubber industry and let it take its natural course. In other words, since the Dutch possessions do not agree to restrict rubber production, Malayan rubber merchants should seek their own relief. The world's existing rubber reserves will reach 500,000 tons, while the world's rubber consumption is only 63,500 tons per month. There is no way to sell the stockpiled rubber, and there is no way to restrict the production of new rubber. The more production, the larger the stockpile, and the lower the rubber price. This is inevitable. During this crisis, large-capital rubber plantation owners can still barely maintain, but small-capital rubber plantations are in danger of bankruptcy everywhere. At this time of plummeting rubber prices, the plight of overseas Chinese who have worked hard to obtain hundreds of acres of rubber plantations is even more unbearable. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Reuters, Leipzig, 26th - At today's resumption of the trial of three junior officers charged with treason, witness Lieutenant Colonel Wenset testified that he and another officer had met with the defendant, Lieutenant Rudeen, in Hanover. At that time, Rudeen was willing to introduce them to a leader of the National Socialist Party, but Rudeen stated that events that could cause conflict between the army and patriotic groups must be avoided. It was also heard from Lieutenant Colonel Lüberlin that he had contacted the leaders of the South German Party to seek cooperation between the party and the army. It is necessary to have close contact between the National Socialist Party and the army, and officers should instruct their soldiers with this intention. Lüberlin only asked them to test the opinions of other officers, but did not plan to oppose the national constitution in the near future.</p>
<h3>Japanese People Welcome the US Ambassador to Japan</h3>
<p>Electric Communication Society, Tokyo, 27th - Last night, various circles held a grand welcome dinner at the Huazu Hall for the new US Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Forbes. The ambassador gave a speech at the banquet, the gist of which was that he hoped that the relationship of mutual trust and friendship between Japan and the United States would continue to grow. Japan and the United States should cooperate and help each other to achieve the common goal of developing the Pacific region. The United States does not want to monopolize special rights in trade, but hopes to coexist and prosper. As for the immigration issue, it is a matter for the parliament and cannot be stated explicitly. However, the Pacific coastal states greatly appreciate the diligence of the Japanese and are very grateful. In short, the greatest interest of both countries lies in increasing mutual legitimate interests.</p>

<h3>Guide the Huai River Committee Asks for Appropriations</h3>
<p>National Government Orders the Ministry of Finance to Investigate and Allocate Funds</p>
<p>The National Government issued instructions to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "According to the report of the Guide the Huai River Committee, the engineering expenses of the Committee are huge and difficult to raise. The Ministry of Finance has determined that the monthly operating expenses for the 18th year should be 30,000 yuan and has repeatedly requested that they be allocated according to the budget. However, the Ministry of Finance has not allocated them to date due to the exhaustion of funds. Since the establishment of the Committee in July of last year, it has been necessary to set up an office in Huaiyin, open a training class for engineering personnel, organize design, surveying, and mapping departments, and organize reconnaissance teams, survey teams, and hydrological stations for engineering matters such as hiring German consulting engineer Fang Xius to work in China. The expenses are huge and urgent. The Committee has been forced to borrow a total of 325,000 yuan from the General Headquarters Accounting Office from July of last year to August of this year. In addition to repaying 25,000 yuan to the office on August 6th of last year, the actual loan is 300,000 yuan. It has been stated that it will be repaid as soon as the funds from the Ministry of Finance are received. Now that the accounting year has long ended, this amount should be settled clearly to clear the boundaries. It has been found that the Ministry of Finance should allocate 30,000 yuan per month for the Committee's operating expenses. In addition to the insufficient funds for July and August, which will be requested separately, the amount to be received from September of last year to June of this year is a total of 300,000 yuan, which is equal to the number of the Committee's debts and can be used to offset them. Please order the Ministry of Finance to raise funds in the same amount to facilitate repayment and clear the account. It is reasonable to open a clear fold and submit it with a document for your approval and instructions." Therefore, in addition to the instructions, a copy of the attached fold is issued to the Ministry to investigate and allocate the funds as necessary.</p>
<h3>Gan Party and Government Representatives Go to Hankou to Request Troops</h3>
<p>The Bandits of Yuanzhou Have Been Repelled</p>
<p>Gong and Luo Divisions Enter Gan in Separate Routes</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang's bandit gangs, divided from Xiang into three routes, fled to Gan's border area of Pingxiang and Wanzai, bordering Yichun. Yichun, in western Gan, was recently captured by scattered bandits, echoing Zhu and Mao. Lu Dipin received a telegram from Zhangshu stating, "Lu Jun, Commander-in-Chief in Nanchang, be advised that intelligence reports indicate the communist bandits in Yuanzhou have not yet withdrawn from the county seat. However, the county magistrate has led over ten thousand members of the security corps and the public to encircle the bandits on all sides, and they should be able to retake it today. Zhang Zhenqing, Chief of the Zhangshu Public Security Bureau, respectfully reports." The Yichun County natives living in the province also arrived at the provincial government yesterday to petition. Lu told the representatives that he had ordered Dai's brigade in Shanggao to suppress the bandits. Furthermore, according to military sources, Yuanzhou has already been recovered, and the Dai, Zhu, Wang, and Luo brigades of the 18th and 50th Divisions are guarding the area along Yifeng, Shanggao, Gaoan, and Xinyu, forming an arc-shaped defensive line towards the Xiang border. The arrangement is extremely tight, awaiting the arrival of Xiang and E troops at appropriate locations before launching a large-scale encirclement and suppression. Furthermore, Lu received a telegram from Yang Duo, the liaison staff of the 9th Route Army stationed in Wuhan, stating that He Yingqin has ordered the Gong and Luo Divisions to enter Gan in separate routes to bolster troop strength and dispatched a water plane to Gan, arriving in Nanchang within three days for use in coordinating with the Cather and Moth aircraft to bomb the bandits.</p>
<p>For the sake of suppressing the communist bandits, Lu Dipin convened a discussion meeting of various committee members at the provincial government yesterday morning, designating Wang Yinxi to go to Hankou to report on the bandit situation in the province, request instructions on everything, and urge friendly troops to quickly enter Gan to assist in the suppression. The provincial party headquarters also held an emergency meeting yesterday, designating Liu Zhenqun to accompany Wang Yinxi to Hankou to request He to quickly dispatch a large army into Gan to encircle and suppress Zhu and Mao. The two representatives left the province for Xun last night (the 25th) and will take an airline plane to Hankou this morning.</p>
<p>Although the authorities' precautions against the bandit disaster are very strict, the scattered bandits in various places have not been quelled. Yudu in southern Gan has always been a den of communist bandits, and the county was captured by bandits on the 12th of this month. Corpses with severed heads and bodies were everywhere, shocking the eye. On the 14th, the bandits kidnapped over a hundred small and medium-sized merchants, and their fate is unknown. Hundreds of rooms in the Liao family ancestral hall outside the West Gate and dozens of rooms in the earthen enclosure several miles from the city were burned down. The cruelty is unprecedented. The natives of the county living in the province came to the provincial government today to petition. Lu agreed to send a telegram ordering Ma's brigade to suppress the bandits. As for Fang Zhiyu, who occupied Jingzhen, since entering the town on the 28th of last month, he ordered all workers in the town to stop work and join his ranks, looting the shops and leaving them empty. Many people were killed, and those who asked to be shot were spared the pain. The bandits angrily scolded, "My bullet is worth much more than your life!" Fang initially intended to install a power grid around the town and dig trenches, desperately defending it. However, seeing that Yue's army had arrived, he feared being surrounded and retreated to the Anhui border on the 21st.</p>
<p>Regarding the above situations, Commander-in-Chief Zhang also briefly reported, stating, "According to intelligence reports, Zhu and Mao's main force retreated towards Pingxiang and Liling, and Peng and Huang's main force retreated towards Liuyang. A small group retreated towards You County. The communists' intentions are difficult to determine at this time, but in Jiangxi, we have sufficient strength to prevent them from infiltrating. Behind the bandits, there are six or seven divisions chasing them. In any case, we can ensure that there is no danger." (September 26)</p>
<h3>Mass Execution of Communists in Wuhan</h3>
<p>Totaling Forty-Four Men and Women</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Wuhan Garrison Command executed forty-four male and female communists next to the First Prison in Wuchang on the 26th. It is found that the largest number of communists executed in Wuhan was during the Hu Tao era, when twenty-six people were executed at one time. It is the first time that more than forty people have been executed. The published charges are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Charge One: In accordance with the instruction No. 563 of the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and the telegram from the National Government, you are directed to instruct the President of the Hubei Higher Court to transfer the convicted communists to military organs for separate handling, etc. In addition to separate orders, you are hereby ordered to comply with the above instructions. Upon receipt of this order, the Hubei Higher Court submitted forty-nine individuals including Zhao Min, along with the case files, requesting compliance with the above instructions. After reviewing the original files in detail, except for twenty-three individuals including Tang Yingjin who are being handled in separate cases, the twenty-six individuals including Zhao Min were confirmed to have joined the Communist Party and were responsible for their work. Zhao Min, Li Zhengguo, Xu Wei, and three others convened meetings to conspire to endanger the Party and the country. Chang Renqing, Wan Chunguan, Zhang Jiucheng, Feng Zhanao, Li Sanlao, Wei Heshang, Yi Yuanqing, Lin Bishun, Ma Lingzhou, Fu Jian, Fu Xiang, Xiang Jing, Huang Zicai, and Li Liushi, and fourteen others privately established organs and planned riots.

Chang Weihan, Liu Chuming, Wang Xinli, and Song Xirun, and four others helped the bandits and spied on military intelligence. All of them provided conclusive evidence that their crimes were unforgivable. According to confidential reports, after the prisoners were imprisoned, they continued to spread the communist ideology without any restraint. Fu Jian and Zhang Jiucheng were responsible for communicating with the executed bandit leader He Kong in secret to organize riots. Such tigers and rhinos in cages still have the potential to erupt at any time. They have the hearts of owls and jackals and have no hope of repentance. All of them should be sentenced to death in accordance with the National Government's Secret Order No. 10 to serve as a warning. In addition to signing and executing the aforementioned prisoners in the execution ground, a public announcement is hereby made. The list is as follows: Zhao Min, 29 years old, from Hankou; Li Zhengguo, 24 years old, from Hankou; Xu Wei (also known as Xu Daohuan), 30 years old, from Daye County; Chang Renqing, 41 years old, from Jianli County; Wan Chunguan, 34 years old, from Xiaogan; Zhang Jiucheng, 34 years old, from Huanggang County; Feng Zhanao, 36 years old, from Wuchang; Li Sanlao (also known as Li Yunqing), 28 years old, from Wuchang County; Wei Heshang, 21 years old, from Tianmen County; Yi Yuanqing, 22 years old, from Huanggang County; Lin Bishun, 26 years old, from Wuchang; Ma Lingzhou, 28 years old, from Wuchang; Fu Jian, 24 years old, from Mayang, Hunan; Fu Xiang, 20 years old, same as above; Xiang Jing, 22 years old, from Hengshan County, Hunan; Huang Zicai, 22 years old, from Changde, Hunan; Li Liushi (also known as Liu Yingmei), 27 years old, from Changsha, Hunan; Lin Qianbing, 27 years old, from Jianli County; Cai Jixiang, 20 years old, from Huanggang County; Wu Zukang, 33 years old, from Huanggang County; Li Jinwen, 30 years old, from Daye County; Jiang Changhao, 37 years old, from Macheng; Chang Weihan, 35 years old, from Jianli; Liu Chuming, 25 years old, from Echeng County; Wang Xinli, 23 years old, from Macheng; Zhu Xirun, 35 years old, from Macheng.</p>
<p>Charge Two: Approved by the Hubei Higher Court for the continued submission of five communist criminals including Wan Jinbo, along with the relevant case files, requesting compliance with the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Order No. 563. The department conducted a hearing and, based on a detailed review of the submitted case files, proved that Wan Jinbo joined the Communist Party, transmitted letters, and was responsible for transportation; Hu Chunjie joined the Communist Party and served as the branch secretary and cadre; Liu Shao'e colluded with Communist Party leader Liu Hongxuan to kidnap Wang Shengdian's younger brother and extorted 400 yuan.

<p>Charge Three: Regarding the case of the Hubei Higher Court's submission of forty-nine communist criminals including Zhao Min, requesting compliance with the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Order No. 563, after a detailed review of the original case files, except for the fact that twenty-six individuals including Zhao Min have already been sentenced to death and executed, and that the cases of ten individuals including Wang Yueqiu should be handled separately, Tang Yingjin confessed to joining the Communist Party and secretly plotting a riot in the Shashi area; Weng Shijing, Qin Xuzhao, and Tang Liangrong confessed to organizing a Red Army to commit arson and murder; Zhu Yulin confessed to secretly plotting a riot; Liu Yimin, Cao Shuwen, Hu Tianjing, Wang Shoushan, and Huang Chuxia confessed to holding important positions in the Communist Party and spreading reactionary ideas in prison; Bai Yanlao, Wu Yanxing, and Tang Tanqing confessed to holding secret meetings to incite strikes.

<h3>Zhejiang Province Temporarily Postpones Cancellation of Subsidy Tax</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government previously instructed the Finance Department to review the resolution of the Third Zhejiang Provincial Representative Conference, requesting the Central Government to order the cancellation of the Zhejiang Provincial Subsidy Tax to alleviate the people's plight. After receiving the order, the Finance Department believed that the land in Zhejiang Province was being reorganized. When the new tax law is implemented in the future, the old land tax system will naturally be abolished. However, in the current transitional era, it is necessary to maintain the status quo. A report was submitted to the provincial government, requesting a temporary postponement of the change. The original report is excerpted as follows: "The collection of subsidy tax under the land tax item in Zhejiang Province was established by the Zhejiang Provincial Provisional Assembly in the Land Tax Collection Law in the first year of the Republic of China. It was stipulated that the tribute rice and military rice collected in the past would be abolished. Later, due to the exhaustion of government funds, this large amount of income could not be compensated for in other ways. The Central Senate decided to change the collection to a subsidy, which was still collected at the original tax rate and discounted. This is how the subsidy tax was collected under the land tax item in Zhejiang Province. According to the original rice quota, the annual actual collection of the subsidy tax is about 500,000 shi, with a provincial tax of three yuan and three jiao, totaling a real income of about 1.3 million silver dollars. This is a large item in the provincial treasury's income, and many provincial and county local surcharges are levied under the subsidy tax item based on the shi quota. The expenditures are all necessary for local construction and are not only impossible to reduce, but also often short of funds. The budget is in place and can be restored. According to the original proposal, the subsidy tax belongs to Zhejiang, while neighboring Jiangsu Province also collects tribute grain outside of the land tax, although the name is different, the nature is the same, and the discount is even higher than that of Zhejiang. It is said that the rent reduction in Zhejiang Province has been implemented, and the tax should be reduced along with the rent, which is to take care of the interests of the owners. The Land Tax Law has been promulgated by the Central Government, and the national land tax is being revised in accordance with it. The land reorganization in Zhejiang Province has long been planned and is in progress. In the future, when the reorganization is completed, the new tax law must be implemented, and the old land tax system will be abolished to eliminate the accumulation of historical biases and establish fair, simple, and good regulations to start anew with the people. The current time is a transitional period, and the status quo must be maintained in order to maintain the overall situation. It is proposed to temporarily postpone the change in order to maintain the overall situation."</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Zhao from Hujiaqiao Kidnapped for the Second Time: Zhao Xichang, who previously opened an oil mill in Hujiaqiao Town, was kidnapped by bandits last year and spent a lot of money to redeem himself, and had no intention of doing business. Unexpectedly, at 7:00 a.m. the day before yesterday (the 25th), his mother, Qin, and his younger sister, Ergou, hired a boat to Songjiang to purchase clothes and other items for a happy event. At around 11:00 a.m., when the boat passed the Majingqiao area near Huan'an, it was suddenly encountered by two bandit boats. The bandits claimed to be searching and forced the boat to stop. More than a dozen burly men, all wearing Zhongshan suits and carrying box guns, boarded the boat, kidnapped Qin and her daughter, and looted their luggage and silver dollars, then sailed south. Their whereabouts are unknown. Upon receiving the report, their family immediately sent people to the police and government agencies to request rescue.</p>
<p>Review of the Irregularities in the Rice Price Stabilization Case: The county government ordered the Rice Price Stabilization Bureau to submit a report for review regarding the alleged irregularities in the rice price stabilization in the ninth district of this county. In order to be cautious, the bureau convened a meeting on the 26th to review the accounts of the rice price stabilization in the district. It was reported that the review revealed that the district sold only 780 bags of rice for more than 4,000 yuan, which seemed too much. According to the report, the number of rice purchases and the invoices from the rice shops did not match. The district office announced on the 25th that the funds were exhausted and the rice was gone, but on the 26th, it reported the purchase of 360 bags of rice, which was even more conspicuous. An item for wine expenses was listed in the accounts, which was inconsistent with the purpose of rice price stabilization. It was decided to report the seven items to the county government and request that they be transferred to the judiciary for thorough investigation. Furthermore, Sun, the director of a certain rice distribution point in the district, privately sold four bags of rice for price stabilization to the Beihuitong Rice Shop in this city. The district itself investigated and reported the facts to the county government for review.</p>
<p>Dianshan Town Robbed by Bandits: Dianshan Town, located at the junction of Punan, Songjiang, and Jinshan, was robbed by sixteen or seventeen bandits, all carrying guns, on the night of the 26th.

<p>Appeal Judgment in the Case of Burying a Brother Alive: Guan Maoda, the 13-year-old son of Guan Liukun, a villager in Zeziwan, Minong Township, Baoshan County, was premeditatedly killed by his cousin Hou Genbao on the eighth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar this year. Hou buried the corpse in the small earth embankment near the Tanziwan tomb mountain to destroy the evidence. After the case was discovered, the Shanghai Jiaotong Road Police Precinct arrested Hou and sent him to the Shanghai Local Court. On June 21, he was sentenced to death. Hou refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the High Court. On the previous (23rd) day, Judge Huang Bingdao of the Third Criminal Tribunal concluded the trial. Yesterday (27th) afternoon, he came to the court to announce the judgment. The original judgment regarding the crime was revoked. Hou Genbao was sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime of premeditated murder, deprived of public rights for life, and iron hammers and wooden hammers were confiscated. After hearing the judgment, Hou Genbao declared in court that he did not accept it and would appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Yang Huiru Died from Burns: Yang Huiru, a graduate of the Female Sericulture School in Huguan, 20 years old, from Wuxi, was working at the Dayou Seed Breeding Farm. On the previous (24th) day, when she was measuring silkworm seeds, she accidentally left a fire seed in the fire wine, which burned her whole body and destroyed all her clothes. She was sent to Boxi Hospital in Tiancizhuang and died of serious injuries the night before (26th).</p>
<p>Bandit Intrusion in Wujiang County: Bandits are rampant in the Binhu area of the tenth district of Wujiang County, and residents cannot sleep peacefully at night. Middle-class families have moved away one after another, and those who remain in the countryside can only be slaughtered like fish and meat. The roads are full of thorns, and there is no way to complain, which is regrettable. Tracing the reasons, the collusion and enticement of local ruffians is the biggest problem. It is said that among the six or seven miles of the most famous areas in the vicinity of Lujiabang and Wulu along the lake are Wu Xuqian, Dwarf Da, Fan Asan, a fisherman from Shuangtaqiao, and a wooden figure carver from Xiaoyanggang, all of whom have joined the gang. In addition, Shi Aru and Shi Baolin from Lujiagang, Laoqiezi from Caishen Pavilion, Mao Erbao from Tingzigang, Ni Dabao from Nijiagang, Blind Shen Shusheng from Wulu, and Tang San, a monk from Wujieting, usually gather to gamble, sell cigarettes, and hide bandits. These people communicate with each other, with titles such as "resident scout" and "errand runner." Because these people are all locals, they know who can be kidnapped and who can be robbed, and they have long planned it out. They act as accomplices for the bandits, secretly guiding them. After the event is completed, they divide the spoils and live a carefree life. The local residents value their lives and property, so they can only keep silent. Recently, on the night of the 13th of this month, Sheng Zhusheng from Wujieting and the Chen family who opened a bow shop in Nijiadun were robbed, and it is said that they were all related to these people. What is even more serious is that it is said that the hostages kidnapped in Lüjiawan, Zhejiang, were hidden in Mao Erbao's house in Tingzigang, where they ate, drank, gambled, and spoke without restraint. When the Suzhou Water Police Patrol team arrived at Wulu and heard about the matter, they arrested Mao and sent him to the Damiaogang Public Security Bureau for detention pending transfer to the county. However, a certain principal of a certain elementary school publicly vouched for him, so Mao Erbao was able to escape. Although public outrage was aroused and public opinion was boiling for a time, no one dared to do anything.</p>

<p>Jiangyin Property Bureau Appeals for the People: The Jiangsu Finance Department issued a notice to all counties a month ago, ordering them to continue to levy an additional two yuan per shi when collecting the winter tax this year, according to the method of the 16th year of the Republic of China. The Wuxi County Finance Bureau has already received the order to comply. However, various groups and institutions in Jiangyin believe that the taxes in Jiangsu counties are the heaviest in the country, and coupled with years of disasters and banditry, the people are struggling to survive and cannot bear the burden of additional tax. After a joint meeting, it was decided to jointly appeal to the provincial government and the Finance Department by the Property Bureau and various groups, requesting them to withdraw the order. Yesterday, they also forwarded a letter to the Wuxi County Government and neighboring counties, requesting them to proceed in unison.</p>

They found a jar of poisonous pills with about 100 pills near a boy about thirteen or fourteen years old. The pills were larger than red pills and were made of earth skin. The boy and the poisonous pills were sent to the county for questioning. At the same time, Hang Xienan and Zhang Yunxuan, who purchased the poisonous pills, were also sent by the Public Security Bureau. Zhou Chengshen, a member of the staff, opened a court to question Hang and Zhang. Hang and Zhang confessed that the pills could treat stomach gas pain and epidemic diseases, so they went to purchase them and did not know that they were poisonous pills. The boy confessed that his name was Zheng Chenxun and that the poisonous pills were made by his father, and that there were many shareholders, but he did not know the names of the shareholders. After the questioning, Zheng Chenxun was ordered to be detained, and Hang Xienan and Zhang Yunxuan were released on bail.</p>

First, two bandits used a large stone to break open Jia Axing's gate, and then let the bandits in to loot. The bandits were not satisfied and continued to break into the houses of Jia Wangshi and Jia Rongkui next door to loot. After an hour, they left with the loot and a shout. When the bandits were robbing, Jia Axing's wife, Tu, and Jia Wangshi rushed to the ninth branch of the Public Security Bureau in charge and asked them to send police to pursue the stolen goods. After receiving the report, the branch chief sent a police officer to pursue them. When they arrived at the Huishan Branch Road, they suddenly met two bandits wearing short clothes and carrying packages on their backs. They immediately stepped forward to arrest them and took them to the bureau. Branch Chief Liu opened a court to question them. The bandits confessed that their names were Gu A'er, from Jiangyin, and currently living in the Jinji Silk Factory workshop. When asked, Lu Baolin confessed that he was from Jiangyin, and the stolen goods were wrapped in packages and placed in the mulberry fields on Yusang Lane, and that there were several accomplices hiding somewhere. After receiving the confession, the branch chief is now sending detectives to arrest them and is also sending police to accompany the bandit Lu Baolin to recover the stolen goods. The loss suffered by Jia et al. in this robbery is valued at about 200 yuan.</p>

<p>Educational Institutions Should Pay Attention to the Thoughts of Young People: The County Party Rectification Committee, in view of the fact that the Communist Party often uses cultural institutions as places for latent propaganda, and that young men and women are often seduced and harmed, believes that this is a serious matter. Therefore, it specially submitted a request to the Provincial Party Rectification Committee to consult the Education Department and order the educational institutions in each county to pay attention to the thoughts and actions of young students to see if there are any improper behaviors. If they are minor, they should be guided at any time to correct their tendencies. If they are major, they should immediately report to the highest party and government organs in the county for investigation and punishment. If there are communist members lurking inside and concealing the report, the responsible person of the institution will be questioned. In this way, the communist members will have no chance to lurk, the young people will be able to study with peace of mind, and the country and society will be able to enjoy long-term peace and stability.</p>

<p>All Prisoners Must Keep Their Hair on Top of Their Heads</p>
<p>The Wuxing Local Court and County Prison in this city received an order yesterday from the Provincial Local Court stating that, in light of the recent cases of prison escapes, it is due to the negligence of the responsible officers and the lack of special identification of the prisoners. According to regulations, prisoners serving sentences of imprisonment or detention have traditionally kept their hair on top of their heads in a circular, inch-long style in order to identify them and prevent abuses. Recently, new and old prisons have not uniformly kept the aforementioned hair style for identification purposes. In addition to distributing this order, the court urgently orders the prison director and others to comply with it.

<p>The Dispute Over Feng Erguan's Drowning Death</p>
<p>A male corpse was found floating in the Zhongshi River in Wangdian Town, Jiaxing, at around 6 PM the day before yesterday. Later, Feng Zhitin and others from Xishi recognized the corpse as that of his clan brother, Feng Erguan, who had gone missing on the afternoon of the 22nd after selling three sheep at Zhang Yongyuan's sheep market on the Nantang shore for 20 yuan.

On the 25th, Prosecutor Liu, accompanied by coroner Guan, went to the town to conduct an examination. The examination confirmed that he had drowned before death. The clan members of the deceased suspect that Feng Erguan had a feud with a certain person, and that he was seen walking with that person on the day he disappeared, leading to Feng Erguan's disappearance. It was not until the 24th that his corpse was found in the river. Therefore, there is suspicion as to whether he was pushed into the river or accidentally fell into the river. It is learned that Madam Feng Zhang filed a petition on the 27th, requesting the court to summon witnesses and arrest the murderers in order to clarify the situation.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Requests Subscription to Customs Treasury Bonds</h3>
<p>Separate Letters Sent to Various Groups and Industry Leaders</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has issued 50 million yuan of short-term customs treasury bonds for the 19th year of the Republic of China, which has been approved by the National Government. Fund raising has begun in August of this year. The principal and interest of the fund are guaranteed by increased customs revenue. Yesterday, Minister Song, Deputy Ministers Zhang and Li of the Ministry of Finance, and the Bond Fundraising Committee of the Ministry of Finance sent separate letters to various commercial groups and industry leaders in the city, requesting them to actively subscribe. The two letters are transcribed below:</p>
<p>Minister Song's Letter: Respectfully, I am writing to inform you that the Ministry has issued 50 million yuan of short-term customs treasury bonds for the 19th year of the Republic of China in order to adjust financial finance. The National Government has promulgated the regulations for this matter. These treasury bonds have an monthly interest rate of eight per cent, and the principal will be repaid starting in August of this year. The principal and interest to be repaid are specifically designated to be allocated from the increased customs revenue. The Director-General of Customs is specifically ordered to allocate funds monthly according to the principal and interest repayment schedule and deposit them in the Central Bank for the Jianghai Customs Two-Five Surtax Treasury Bond Fund Management Committee to act as custodian for payment. The fund is extremely stable, the interest rate is very favorable, and the principal is repaid monthly within a very short period, making it very convenient for the bondholder. In the past, the Ministry has issued various bonds, and we have always been grateful for your willingness to subscribe and your patriotic fervor, which we have long admired. The government has always fulfilled its obligations to repay the principal and interest on bonds issued to the public on schedule. For example, the Jianghai Customs Two-Five Surtax Treasury Bonds were fully repaid in December, and the first batch of cigarette tax treasury bonds will also be fully repaid by November of this year. We strive to ensure the stability of the fund, so the prices of various bonds circulating in the market are rising daily, and the credibility is evident. It is conceivable that the issuance of short-term customs treasury bonds now depends even more on your strong support to help us achieve this great undertaking. Therefore, after careful consideration of the situation, we have divided the subscriptions into different levels and plan to request you to subscribe to a certain amount of these treasury bonds and remit the funds on time to meet our urgent needs. The amount set is particularly reduced compared to previous amounts, and we hope that you will comply. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Song Ziwen, Zhang Shouyong, Li TiaoSheng, Sincerely.</p>
<p>Letter from the Fundraising Committee: Dear Sir, With reference to the Ministry of Finance's letter entrusting your committee to solicit subscriptions for the short-term customs treasury bonds for the 19th year of the Republic of China, we have received your letter of September 11th in response, which states that you have convened a meeting to discuss the methods of implementation, etc., which demonstrates your deep sincerity and support, for which we are deeply grateful. The Ministry has issued various bonds in the past, such as the Jianghai Customs Two-Five Surtax Treasury Bonds, which were fully repaid in February of the 18th year, and the subsequent Two-Five Surtax Treasury Bonds, which were repaid with principal and interest on schedule. The first batch of cigarette tax treasury bonds and interest will be fully repaid by November of this year, and the subsequent cigarette tax treasury bonds have also been repaid by more than half. Other bonds, such as the customs treasury bonds for the 18th year of the Republic of China, the demobilization treasury bonds, and the cigarette treasury bonds for the 19th year, are also being repaid on schedule. All public bonds are also being repaid by lottery on schedule according to the principal and interest repayment schedule. The reason for this is that the principal and interest of the bonds are related to the rights of the bondholders and the financial stability of the society. The government upholds national credibility and cares for the livelihood of the people, ensuring the stability of the fund and never delaying repayment, thereby establishing a good reputation and demonstrating great credibility. This is the Ministry's commitment to maintaining the credibility of the bonds it issues, which should be well known to all Chinese people. The interest rate of this short-term customs treasury bond is favorable and the term is short, and it is guaranteed by increased customs revenue, making it extremely stable. All commercial groups in Shanghai and wealthy patriotic citizens have always been eager to subscribe to each bond issued and have achieved excellent results, for which the Ministry has given separate awards to show encouragement. Therefore, after carefully considering your financial resources, we have divided the subscriptions into different levels and prepared letters to urge you to subscribe. We still ask your committee to strongly guide us so that we can achieve great results and remit the funds to the Ministry as soon as possible to meet our urgent needs. This matter concerns the important policies of the party and the country, and we hope that you will make every effort to do so without any delay. We are deeply grateful.</p>

<p>The Citizens' Association issued the following declaration yesterday based on the resolution of the expert committee: The Public Concession Water Company's unprovoked increase of one-fourth of the price has been approved by the Public Works Department, and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association and the Real Estate Association have protested and strongly demanded the cancellation. The water company has only sent a letter requesting the two associations to send representatives to investigate the accounts, but has not expressed any intention to cancel the price increase. This association, as a group of citizens of the special zone, is in a leading position and is dedicated to relieving the suffering of the people. The result of this water rate increase will directly affect the millions of residents of the special zone, and the harm is indescribable. After discussion by the expert committee of this association, the means to deal with the water company are considered unsatisfactory. It was resolved that regardless of the results of the audit, this association will always insist on the original proposal to oppose the price increase. Furthermore, we propose that the price of water must have a fixed standard and must not be calculated based on the amount of rent. The water fee revenue has exceeded several times the increase in rent over the years. From the perspective of social justice, all public utilities must not be for profit, and the price reduction should be implemented to a reasonably low rate to reduce the burden on our citizens, which is fair. Therefore, this case is recorded and announced. The benefit of this matter concerns the personal interests of the citizens of the special zone. We hope that everyone will unite and persist to the end. This association vows to follow this step and strive to be at the forefront for the citizens and to be the support for the two associations, hoping to achieve final victory and seek permanent happiness. This declaration is hereby made.</p>
<h3>Comfort Items Transported to Beijing Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Echoes of the Qiaodian from the Northeast</h3>
<p>A Brief List of Telegraph Headings from the Two Party Departments (Jun Jian): We recently sent a telegram to Deputy Commander Zhang of Shenyang, which reads: "Urgent telegram to Deputy Commander Zhang of Shenyang: We have read Qiao's telegram advocating peace and national salvation, which is beneficial to the people. Your benevolent words are widely praised and celebrated throughout the country. Since Feng and Yan waged war and disrupted unification, the chaotic situation has caused turmoil among the people. The central government's expedition to quell the rebellion was not a matter of choice. Your support of the central government and your joint efforts to punish the rebels have extinguished the flames of rebellion. We hope that you will resolutely uphold your advocacy, thoroughly implement your policy of suppressing the rebels, eliminate the source of the disaster as soon as possible, and complete unification to ensure the stability of the country. The future of the party and the nation depends on it. We are sending this telegram to express our hopes." The Standing Committee of the Executive Committee of the Special Party Department of the Kuomintang Jinghu Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, Min Luona, respectfully thanks you.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Preparatory Committee of the Cigarette Industry Workers' Federation (above omitted): We have read the Qiao telegram and have seen your compassion and loyalty to the country. We are extremely respectful. Yan, Feng, and other rebels rebelled and waged war, which the people have long despised and which the national law cannot tolerate. Today, their remaining breath is scorned by the world and rejected by our people. Your service to the central government and your sincere support are a blessing for the country and the people. We hope that you will remain steadfast and give our people the opportunity to love you for a long time, and urge Yan and Feng to step down so that your painstaking efforts will be revealed to the world. We are sending this telegram to express our hopes. (below omitted)</p>

Thinking of the future, we are all deeply grieved. We respectfully send this telegram of condolence to express our sorrow." (Titles omitted).</p>

<h3>Li Zhonggong Cables Zhang Qun Urging Him to Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>To Assume Position as Commissioner of Reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</p>
<p>Li Zhonggong, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, telegraphed Mayor Zhang of Shenyang yesterday, saying: "To Mayor Zhang Yuejun of Shenyang: I am honored to learn that the National Government has dispatched personnel to reorganize the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and I am fortunate to be among them. I was just hoping to have your leadership when the news of your resignation came, with complicated words and a deteriorating environment. It is known that reorganizing the precarious China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is not easy. However, precisely because it is not easy, it is worth our efforts. Since the Party and the country have entrusted the responsibility to you, how can you bear to sit idly by? Since Tieqiao has died in the line of duty, we should continue to struggle. I hope you will strive to undertake this arduous task and return quickly to take charge. I, though unworthy, will certainly risk sacrifice and follow you to save the shipping industry and repay the Party and the country. Please let me know when you will be leaving. I, Li Zhonggong, await your instructions with gratitude."</p>
<h3>Letter of Appointment for Reorganization Commissioner of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Has Been Issued</h3>

The official letter of appointment was also issued by the National Government's Office of Civil Affairs yesterday. It is reported that Chairman Zhang Qun has resigned, and the National Government is now trying to retain him. Regarding the issue of convening a meeting of the reorganization committee, the commissioners in Shanghai all advocate waiting for Chairman Zhang to return to Shanghai before setting a date for convening the meeting and announcing the assumption of office.</p>
<h3>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Actively Proceeds with Reorganization</h3>
<p>Board Meeting: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company held its first board meeting at 3 p.m. yesterday. Those present included General Manager Li Zhonggong, Secretary-General Song Shuqiao, Secretaries Chen Zizhen, Zhou Shian, Yu Zhiming, Business Section Chief Shen Zhongyi, Deputy Managers Li Yunliang, He Molin, Shipping Section Chief Huang Penghao, Singapore Manager Cao Renze, Managers of the Four Warehouses Li Gufan, Deputy Manager Li Jingxiang, Industrial Section Chief Fu Jucun, Accounting Section Chief Kong Xiangyu, Deputy Manager Deng Xieren, Administrative Section Chief Lu Qinghai, Treasury Director Wang Yujun, and Recorder Zhang Shoufeng.

Then, the heads of each section verbally reported on the general situation of their respective sections. Subsequently, the meeting discussed the agenda items: (1) Confirming the procedure for implementing the National Government's Regulations on the Reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Contents: (A) From the date of promulgation and implementation of the National Government's Regulations on the Reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the original regulations of the company should be amended in accordance with the regulations. It was resolved to organize a drafting committee for the regulations of the General Management Office to formulate them. Before all regulations are revised, the existing regulations shall still apply, except for those that fundamentally conflict with the reorganization</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Regulations. (B) The General Management Office shall announce that from the date of implementation of the National Government's Provisional Regulations on the Reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the regulations, the commissioners of the office have full power to represent the company externally and to execute company affairs. Any external contract or act concluded in the name of the company, or the content of the contract involves the company's assets or other rights, shall not take effect unless signed by the commissioners of the office. However, the office will continue to be responsible for and recognize any contracts legally concluded by the company in the past before the implementation of the regulations. (2) Regarding the cleaning up of share rights and safeguarding investment matters, it was resolved to establish a share rights cleaning up committee. (3) Regarding debt reorganization matters, it was resolved to establish a debt reorganization committee to reorganize debts and consolidate credit. (4) Since there are no fixed regulations for the salaries of crew members, it was resolved that the shipping section should consider the situation and formulate methods to be submitted for approval. (5) Regarding the rectification of coal consumption and materials for each ship, it was resolved that the shipping and administrative sections should jointly formulate rectification methods. (6) Regarding the bulk purchase of coal for stockpiling, it was resolved that it should be handled in advance if funds are sufficient.

(10) Regarding the rental of ships for military service, it was resolved that the business, administrative, and accounting sections should jointly handle it. (11) Regarding internal audit matters within the company, in principle, the audit should be independent. Details shall be formulated by the drafting committee. The meeting adjourned at around 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Military Transportation Transferred to the Administrative Section: Because military transportation requires the requisition of commercial ships, this matter is the responsibility of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in this port. In the past, the task of scheduling and responding to the requisition of ships was the responsibility of Cao Renze, an employee of the business section. Over the past year, Mr. Cao has made considerable contributions. Now that Cao has been promoted to deputy chief of the shipping section, the new general manager, Li Zhonggong, issued an order yesterday stating that the business section has a lot of work, and the two section chiefs, Shen and Li, are already extremely busy handling official business. Now that the ships on the Yangtze River and the sea are officially resuming operations, the responsibilities of the section are even heavier. Therefore, the task of scheduling ships requisitioned by the Ministry of Transportation will be taken over by the administrative section from today to facilitate coordination. The order has been issued for compliance, and the business section is already in the process of handing over.</p>
<p>Resumption of Operations of Sea Vessels: The company's North and South Pacific routes have not been running regular schedules for over a year. This time, with the approval of General Manager Li and the Ministry of Transportation, the sea vessels with passenger cabins will be released back to Shanghai first, with plans to resume regular schedules on the North and South Pacific routes simultaneously. It has been decided that from October 1, the Xin Feng and Xin Ming will be assigned to the North Pacific route, and the Guangli will be assigned to the South Pacific route. The three ships for Fuzhou and Wenzhou will continue to operate, while the routes to Qingdao and Dalian will resume after the Gongping, Yushun, etc., are released to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Dispatching Soldiers for Escort: There are currently six ships sailing on the Yangtze River, and one express ship has also been opened upstream. In order to prevent disturbances by bandits along the way, which hinder travel, the company requested the Capital Garrison Headquarters to increase the number of armed constables on each ship to four to protect them. Negotiations have been ongoing for a long time but have not been implemented. With General Manager Li's telegram request yesterday, the Capital Garrison Commander Gu Zhengtong agreed to allow five fully armed constables to be stationed on each ship to provide protection. The escort will be implemented from today's upstream ships, with a total of 45 soldiers assigned to each ship.</p>
<p>Ship Repair: Among the ships damaged on the Yangtze River and awaiting repair, the Jiangda ship has already been ordered to submit a bid and enter the dock for construction. The Jiangyu ship, which was damaged in Anhui, was towed by the Jianghua ship yesterday and has also arrived in Shanghai and will enter the factory for major repairs immediately. The Emei, which has been repaired, is planned to be sent to the Sichuan River once.</p>
<h3>Memorial Service for Mr. Yuan Guanlan Today</h3>
<p>The memorial service for Mr. Yuan Guanlan will be held at 2 p.m. today at the Zhonghua Vocational School outside the Upper West Gate. The following is an excerpt from Huang Yanpei's eulogy for Mr. Yuan: "Mr. Yuan's given name was Xishou, and he was from Baoshan, Jiangsu. As a student, he studied at the Longmen Academy in Shanghai, broadly studying classical Chinese culture and also astronomy, geography, and natural history. However, his family became increasingly poor. He often carried books and wore shabby clothes, walking between Songjiang and Shanghai. In the Dingyou year of the Guangxu reign (1897), he passed the imperial examination and became a juren. He served as a professor at the Guang Fangyan Academy, further studying new knowledge and returning to education. In the Gui Mao year (1903), he founded the Baoshan County School. In the Jia Chen year (1904), he and other students from Longmen jointly proposed to transform it into a normal school. In the autumn, he went to Japan to conduct research. The following year, the school was completed, and Mr. Yuan served as its principal. He also planned to establish Fudan Public School and the Taicang County Middle School. He was appointed as the Jiangsu Education Affairs Councilor and the Shanghai General Engineering Bureau Councilor. Subsequently, he accepted the invitation of the Zhili</p>
<p>Yuan Guanlan's Portrait</p>
<p>Education Commissioner to serve as the head of the General Affairs Section and the head of the Library Section of the Education Department. In the first year of the Republic of China, he was summoned by Cai Yuanpei, the Minister of Education, to serve as the director of the General Education Department of the Ministry of Education. He advocated for national higher normal schools and personally went to the provinces to inspect and plan for them. Later, he was reassigned as an inspector. Mr. Zhang Yiqing and Mr. Fan Yuanlian successively served as Ministers of Education and both appointed Mr. Yuan as Vice Minister. For six years, during the declaration of war against Germany, as Vice Minister, he served on the Wartime International Affairs Committee. With Mr. Yuan's efforts, the Shanghai Tongji Medical University was maintained without collapsing. In the seventh year, he resigned and traveled to Europe and America, visiting more than ten countries. He was particularly interested in compulsory education. Upon his return, he promoted it through writing and speaking, and was appointed as the president of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association and the president of the Jiangsu Compulsory Education Promotion Association. He intended to implement his ideals in one province, but was unable to do so. Therefore, he implemented them in one county and one township. The revision of the national education system and the investigation of the Gengzi indemnity were based on his detailed research and used as</p>
<p>proposals for provincial and county education, as well as important administration. Mr. Yuan treated people with sincerity and was diligent and hardworking in his self-discipline. He was broad-minded and generous in dealing with affairs. His scholarship was unique and rigorous. His demeanor was natural and unrestrained, and his character was lofty. On August 29th, in the 19th year of the Republic of China, he died of illness in Shanghai at the age of sixty-five. In his last two years, he was the director of the Renwenshe (Humanities Society), compiling books. His work was not completed before his death. Therefore, I paint this portrait of Mr. Yuan and write this eulogy: He planned but did not succeed, but he thought for others. His arguments were clear, and his aspirations were high. His contributions to the community were abundant. He called out but was not heard in one country, one province, one village, or one well. However, his teachings were successful. May Mr. Yuan rest in peace."</p>
<h3>Increased Cotton Yarn Exports to India</h3>
<p>Opportunity to Expand Trade with India</p>
<p>According to a survey yesterday, since the non-violent resistance movement in India, the export and sale of Chinese goods to India has developed considerably. Among them, the progress of cotton yarn is the fastest. Statistics show that over 3,000 bales of cotton yarn exported from this port and sold to India this month. This number has set a new record in history. However, it is expected that the export volume will increase next month. According to the yarn industry, the imported cotton yarn is mainly 42 count, 40 count, and 32 count, and the main import locations are Mumbai and Rangoon, which is a good opportunity for our country's trade with India.</p>

<h3>Anti-Opium Association Expands Anti-Opium Publicity</h3>
<p>Letter Requesting All National Newspapers</p>
<p>To Publish a Special Issue</p>
<p>The 7th National Anti-Opium Movement Week is scheduled to be held from October 1st to 7th. Preparations have been very busy recently. The association believes that this time coincides with the International Anti-Narcotics Conference to be held in Geneva in a few months. The domestic anti-opium publicity should be more effortful than before. Therefore, it has contacted the news media in major ports across the country in advance to jointly publish a special anti-opium issue during the movement period to facilitate publicity. It is reported that nearly a dozen places in the near provinces, such as the Capital Central Daily News, Zhenjiang Jiangji Daily, Hangzhou Republic Daily, and Wujin Shan Daily, have agreed to publish special issues one after another. Distant provinces such as Tianjin, Hong Kong, Jinan, and Hankou have also sent letters agreeing and have sent the manuscripts in advance. The association believes that this matter should be popularized throughout the country. Yesterday, it sent a special letter to all newspapers, large and small, requesting them to publish special issues during Anti-Opium Week.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Inspection Institute Inspects Local Wheat</h3>
<p>Implementation to Begin on October 1st</p>
<p>The Shanghai Flour Mill Association requested that measures be taken to ban the long-standing problem of mixing cement and other impurities into wheat. In order to improve the quality of agricultural products and protect public health, the Shanghai Agricultural Products Inspection Institute has reported the situation to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines for approval and will implement inspections in stages to eliminate the long-standing malpractice of fraud. Since the counties north of the Yangtze River are the richest wheat-producing areas, the Gongbei branch office was first ordered to conduct inspections to clear the source of malpractices. Although it has not been long since the Jiangbei branch office inspected wheat in Gaoyou, Guazhou, and Huojiaqiao, the malpractice of wheat fraud has been reduced. The Agricultural Inspection Institute believes that Shanghai is a central location for transportation and sales. The wheat produced in various provinces and counties in the Yangtze River Basin is transported to Shanghai. The malpractice of fraud becomes even more serious during long-distance transportation. If inspections are not implemented uniformly, it will not be enough to prevent long-standing malpractices, which will have a significant impact on wheat quality, agricultural product credibility, public health, and the interests of manufacturers. In view of the above-mentioned circumstances, the Agricultural Inspection Institute has drafted provisional measures for inspecting wheat and submitted them to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines for approval. The inspection and sale of wheat in Shanghai is actively preparing various inspection equipment. It is reported that the institute has ordered various wheat inspection instruments from Japan and the United States, and the preparation procedures are already underway. It has been decided to start inspecting wheat in Shanghai on October 1st. It is also reported that in order to facilitate the inspection of wheat for merchants, in addition to setting up an inspection general office at the institute on Tiantong Road, inspection branch offices will also be set up in Zhabei and the South City. Yesterday, the institute notified the above-mentioned sections to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Flour Mills Association, Miscellaneous Grains Association, and Miscellaneous Grains Exchange and other organizations to instruct their respective wheat firms and dealers to report inspections in accordance with regulations.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute Case of the Steamboat and Wood Industry Union</h3>
<p>Arbitration Rescheduled to October 2nd</p>
<p>The labor dispute case in this city where the steamboat and wood industry union demanded that the foremen improve their treatment and revise the conditions was previously submitted to the municipal government for arbitration. The meetings were scheduled repeatedly. At first, the capitalists refused to send representatives, so the arbitration could not be made.</p>
<p>Later, due to a legal interpretation, the municipal government forwarded the request to the central government for interpretation. It has been several months since then. The industry union has repeatedly requested a prompt arbitration so that the workers can work with peace of mind. The arbitration committee scheduled a meeting for the 25th of this month. However, on that day, in addition to the municipal government representative Guo Shen, the municipal party representative Yang Qingyuan, the special district court representative Pang Shurong, and the Shanghai local court representative Wang Qufei, the municipal chamber of commerce representative Zhang Dalian and the civilian training association's labor representative Wu Xiangyun did not attend, and the meeting could not be held. The meeting has been rescheduled for 1 p.m. on October 2nd, and the parties concerned have been notified and the committee members have been informed to attend at that time.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Explains Reasons for Collecting Handling Fees for Cases</h3>
<p>To Urge the Organization of Trade Associations</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Yong'an Textile Company yesterday explaining the reason for charging handling fees for entrusted matters from non-members, saying, "In reply to your letter of September 26th, the Chamber of Commerce has registered before and instructed you to join the Chamber of Commerce as a store member. Now, you suddenly treat Chamber of Commerce members as requiring a handling fee of 30 yuan per case for requested matters. You are wondering whether you can continue to join the association. We have investigated that Article 2 of the revised Implementing Rules for the Trade Association Law of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, ordered on July 25th of this year, stipulates that when there are seven or more companies in the same industry in the same region, they must organize an association in accordance with this law. The number of textile companies in this city is more than seven, so they should organize a trade association in accordance with the law and cannot join the association alone as a store member. As for the Chamber of Commerce's previous letter requesting that you be handled as a member of the Chamber of Commerce, this was because the joint organization of industries above one region had not yet been discussed and decided by the Legislative Yuan, so it was still regarded as not having a trade association. Now, the Law on Trade Associations has been discussed and decided by the Legislative Yuan. According to Article 14 of the Amendment, if two or more trade associations</p>
<p>are agreed by more than two-thirds of their members to organize a joint association, then your company is a member of the Chinese Textile Factory Joint Association. However, the organization of a joint association should first organize a trade association in the city where it is located, and then contact other trade associations in various places to organize a joint association to be legal. Now, it has been found that there is no organization of a Chinese Textile Industry Trade Association in this city, and there is only a Chinese Textile Factory Joint Association, which has no legal basis. Based on the above reasons, your company's business is in the same urban area and the number exceeds seven, so you should naturally organize an association and cannot join the Chamber of Commerce as a member. The Chinese Textile Factory Joint Association, which you have joined, cannot join the Chamber of Commerce for the time being because its organization has not been legalized.

<h3>Jisheng Society Investigates Liaoxi Flood</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society has already remitted 10,000 yuan to Suizhong to set up porridge factories and actively provide relief for the flood in Liaoning Province. Yesterday, Mr. Yang Zigong, chairman of the charity associations of the four provinces of Fengtian, Jilin, Rehe, and Heilongjiang, entrusted by General Zhu Ziqiao and Qian Junren, the co-organizers of the relief office, came to Shanghai to report on the disaster. He went to investigate the disaster situation in person and found it to be extremely pitiful. The most severely affected counties and the number of disaster victims he personally investigated are listed below: In Suizhong County, the land is divided into six districts, and more than 30,000 houses were washed away. More than 1,300 people were washed away in the city, and 30,000 houses were collapsed in the four villages. 30,000 mu of farmland were flooded, and there were 70,000 disaster victims. In Jin County, more than 10,000 houses were washed away in Xiguan, and sand flooded and submerged 50,000 disaster victims. In Panshan County, the land is divided into eight districts, and six districts were flooded. More than 20,000 houses were washed away, and there is no hope for the autumn harvest. The water has not receded yet, and there are 120,000 disaster victims. In Xinmin County, the land is divided into eight districts, and six and a half districts were flooded, with 120,000 disaster victims. In Zhaonan County, the entire territory was flooded, with 120,000 disaster victims. In Yi County, two districts were destroyed, with more than 3,000 disaster victims and 200-300 deaths. In Heishan County, there were 3,000 disaster victims. In Chaoyang County, there were more than 10,000 disaster victims. In Zhangwu County, there were 50,000 disaster victims. In Haicheng County, there were more than 4,000 disaster victims. The total number of disaster victims is approximately 6 million. The houses washed away in each county were extremely numerous. Wherever the water reached, the farmland was covered with sand and could not be cultivated. Even the prosperous areas in cities and villages were also covered with sand. The highest place was covered with sand up to one zhang (approximately 3.3 meters), and the lowest place was also 5 chi (approximately 1.67 meters). The urgent relief method requires a huge amount of funds, and the fundamental relief of removing sand from the fields cannot be done without raising huge funds. Now, the disaster victims have no clothes or food, and the situation is even more tragic with the impending cold weather. The magnitude of the disaster and the number of disaster victims are rare in history. We hope that people all over the world will understand this and provide relief and save this catastrophe.</p>

<h3>Two Cars Collide, Crossing Arrest Right in the Way</h3>
<p>Died Without Timely Treatment</p>
<p>Song Shuqiao's and Sun Baorong's Cars</p>
<p>Collide Suddenly on Avenue Dubail</p>
<p>Two Coachmen Shirk Responsibility</p>
<p>Police Are Drawing Diagrams to Study the Matter</p>
<p>At 8:15 a.m. yesterday, the cars of Song Shuqiao, Secretary-General of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Sun Baorong, Advisor to the Municipal Government, collided at the intersection of Avenue Dubail and Rue Pupier in the French Concession, fatally injuring a crossing guard No. 398 standing there. Song, currently residing at No. 47 Wanjian Lane, Rue Luber, owns a private car No. 1873 (Municipal No. 5230). Sun resides at No. 230 Avenue Dubail and his private car number is 2377. At the time, Song's car was heading north and Sun's car was heading west. The crossing guard was standing on the fixed post made of elliptical cement (with two black and white wooden posts about three feet high on the post) facing east. As Song's car approached from the south, he quickly raised the baton he was holding. At the same time, Sun's car sped from the east directly into the center of the road. Seeing this, Song's driver was unable to brake in time and hurriedly turned the front of the car west in an attempt to avoid the danger of a collision, but it was too late and the car directly struck the crossing guard. The guard suffered severe injuries to his legs and waist and immediately fell to the ground without speaking. The elliptical cement and wooden posts were completely smashed. Other guards noticed and went forward to detain the car and reported to the police station. The crossing guard was first sent to Guangci Hospital, but his injuries were too severe and he died less than an hour after arriving at the hospital. The coachman was temporarily detained at the police station. After questioning by the police chief, Song's coachman stated his name was Yu Jingui, from Ningbo, 31 years old. Sun's coachman stated his name was Sun Zulin, from Ningbo, 33 years old. The two men each described the circumstances of the accident and shirked responsibility to each other. Then, personnel from the car department were dispatched to the scene to draw diagrams for future reference. After the crossing guard's body is examined, a review will be conducted.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Two Kidnappers Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>Ma Qiyuan Didn't Want the Police to Lose Face</p>
<p>Asked Newspapers Not to Disclose His Number</p>
<p>Before Execution, the Two Criminals Sobbed Together</p>
<p>Ma Qiyuan (aka Ma Jiyuan), a Henan native who previously served as a police officer, was only twenty-eight years old. Around the years of seventeen and eighteen, he colluded with Liu Fuxing (thirty-four years old) from Suzhou and others to repeatedly kidnap people for ransom. Victims included Ye Daming, Xu Fusun, Xu Wusheng, Chen Xiaofu, etc., who were successively kidnapped. Ye was even shot dead by the kidnappers. Ma and others were involved in all these cases. Later, the Jing'an Temple police station arrested them. At the same time, Wang Liangui, Li Afu, Rong Zhengchang, and Shen Shaoqing were also arrested. The former Provisional Court interrogated and sentenced all six criminals to death and reported to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for approval. The Special District Local Court received a reply from the Provincial Government ordering the execution of Ma and Liu by firing squad. At nine o'clock yesterday morning, Cheng Shangfeng, the execution judge of the Special Court, opened the court and ordered the police to bring Ma and Liu from the West Prison to the court. He announced that the execution was to be carried out today and asked if they had any last words. According to Ma, "I am indeed wronged, but since I have been sentenced to death, I am happy to be executed today. However, as I was a police officer, my execution will inevitably be reported in the newspapers. I request that the reporter not publish my number when I was a police officer in the newspapers so that my colleagues will not lose face because of me." Apart from this, there were no other words. After finishing his statement, he begged for food and drink. Liu Fuxing requested that a letter be sent to Fan Jiantou at No. 251, opposite the Xiaocai Market on Ermalu, asking him to collect the money he had lent out and give it to his mother for her needs. Judge Cheng immediately granted the request. He then ordered an officer to withdraw two yuan from public funds from the accounting department to buy wine and food for Ma and Liu to eat together. After they were drunk and full, the escort detectives escorted the two criminals onto the prisoner car and drove to the Caohejing Jiangsu Second Prison execution ground. The Shanghai Local Court was notified in advance to appoint Prosecutor Wu Shixin as the supervising officer. Then, Police Chief Yang Deshan, Police Inspector Chen Xihui, Supervising Police Wang Jianqing, Xu Guoguang, etc., were ordered to rush to the Caohejing Second Prison execution ground. After the judge took his seat, the two criminals were brought before the court for interrogation. The two criminals sobbed together. The judge immediately ordered the execution. Police Chief Yang commanded the executioner police Gu Hanqing, Yin Daoxu, Xue Bingzhang, etc., to take the criminals down for execution by firing squad. The bodies were collected by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Carpenter's Bestial Act</h3>
<p>Forcibly Defiling a Thirteen-Year-Old Girl</p>
<p>Then Intimidating Her to Prevent Disclosure</p>
<p>Upon Discovery, When Seeking an Explanation</p>
<p>He Had Already Fled Without a Trace</p>
<p>Wang Zhang, a Nanjing woman, lives in the loft on the second floor of No. 19, Zhonghua Lane, Zhengjia Muqiao, in the French Concession. She is thirty-eight years old. Her husband has passed away, leaving her with only one daughter, named Acai, who is only thirteen years old. She is petite and exquisite, with a beautiful appearance. The mother and daughter are dependent on each other, earning a living by washing clothes for others every day. A neighbor, Mr. Jia, is a carpenter and lives on the third-floor sundeck. The other day (the twenty-first), around six or seven in the evening, Ms. Wang happened to be cooking downstairs and ordered Acai to collect clothes from the sundeck. Jia saw that Acai was charming and moving, and he was immediately overcome with bestial lust. He immediately rushed forward and pressed Acai down on the bed, took off her clothes, and stuffed her mouth, committing an inhuman act. Acai was young and weak and could not resist. She had to let him do as he pleased. Before long, he finished and then threatened her with an axe, forbidding her from mentioning a word of it to her mother. But Acai was not yet fully developed, and after being ravaged in this way, she suffered from alternating chills and fever the next morning, and her lower body was swollen and painful. On the twenty-third and twenty-fourth, she was confined to bed, moaning incessantly. Her mother, Zhang, thought it was just a common cold caused by overwork and paid little attention to it. It was not until dinner on the twenty-fifth that Acai could not bear the pain and told her mother about the rape. Ms. Zhang was stunned when she heard this and rushed upstairs to look for Mr. Jia, but he had not returned for two days. Later, the second landlord paid two yuan to hire a car to send her to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The hospital notified the Dada Mingzhong police station and ordered detectives to investigate. After reporting to the police chief, he ordered the pursuit of the lewd scoundrel for investigation.</p>

Yesterday at noon, Mr. and Mrs. Zhang were not at home, leaving their seven-year-old daughter, Zhang Gendi, alone to guard the door. Unexpectedly, Qian Youfa, seeing that there was no one around, was overcome with bestial lust and pinned the child down on a stool, attempting to rape her. Zhang happened to return home and caught him in the act. She immediately grabbed Qian, called the police, and detained him at the Second Branch of the Second District. The case involves offenses against public morals. He was immediately sent to the Local Court for punishment.</p>

<h3>Nitric Acid Spilled, Three Rickshaw Pullers Injured</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at about 3:00 PM, a small cart loaded with several large boxes of nitric acid overturned on the ground at the entrance of Xinguansimen on Sichuan Road. The acid splashed everywhere. Three rickshaws happened to be coming from behind and could not stop in time, slipping to the ground.

<h3>Woman Pretends to Be Pregnant</h3>
<p>Hiding 23,000 Red Pills Inside</p>
<p>At about 9:00 AM yesterday, at the Shanghai South Railway Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, a slow train, No. 6, for second, third, and fourth class passengers was about to depart for Hangzhou. A woman about twenty years old, wearing a cheongsam, came to the station to buy a ticket to Hangzhou. The female inspector of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and Inspector Hu saw that the woman's behavior was suspicious, as she seemed to be faking a pregnancy. The female inspector, together with Patrol Chief Liu Xueli of the Chenjiaqiao branch of the Second District General Office, went forward to inspect her. As expected, she was faking a pregnancy, and the outside was wrapped in cloth and cotton, with 23,000 red pills hidden inside. The person and the contraband were immediately detained and taken to the Gaochang Temple police station. Officer Gao briefly interrogated her, and she claimed to be Shi Xu, 28 years old, from Lanxi, Zhejiang. After the interrogation, a document was prepared and a police officer was sent to the Second District General Office for transfer to the court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Fire on a Japanese Ship in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>The Japanese ship "Wusong Maru" caught fire last night due to carelessness, causing the cotton loaded in the ship to burn for a long time. Because the ship was docked in the Yangshupu River, although the East District Fire Brigade tried their best to put out the fire, it was difficult to succeed. It is said that the loss was very heavy.</p>
<h3>Selling Narcotics Privately and Extorting Good Citizens</h3>
<p>Wang Shutao, a native of Yangzhou, 32 years old, is a small businessman. He recently came to Shanghai from Jiujiang on the Nissin Company's "Xiangyang Maru" steamship, bringing five dou of white rice. After the ship anchored at the Pudong Wharf, he carried the rice ashore and sold it for six yuan and two jiao. Yesterday morning, while walking in a small alley in Lan Nid渡, several hooligans suddenly used the excuse of inviting Wang to tea and dragged him to the home of Wu Youfu, a native of Yangzhou, at No. 29, Changsheng Lane (people generally call it "Stripping Pavilion" because Wu specializes in selling red pills to opium addicts. If poor people who are addicted to opium do not have money to buy it, they can take off their clothes and exchange them for red pills to relieve their cravings). They threatened Wang in every way, claiming that the rice he was carrying was stolen from the ship. They searched him and took away the thirty yuan he had hidden on his person. Still not satisfied, they demanded an additional four yuan before they would let him go. Wang, in a moment of desperation, pretended that the money was elsewhere and that he could go and get it with them. A man named Wang Miaosheng believed him and went out with Wang. Halfway there, Wang Shutao grabbed Wang Miaosheng and handed him over to the police on duty, who took him to the Third District. After a brief interrogation by the District Chief, it was determined that Wu Youfu was privately selling narcotics and that Wang Miaosheng and others were extorting good citizens. The District Chief immediately sent police to Wu's house and arrested Wu and a woman named Xiao Jinfeng. Subsequently, two accomplices, Su Kui and Liao Xiaowanzi, were arrested. It was found out that there were two other accomplices, Ma Xiaosan and Ma Xiaojiu, who were at large. In addition to ordering a strict search for them, all those arrested were sentenced to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Another Record of Cruel Teacher Abusing Apprentice</h3>
<p>The Body Was Not Yet Examined Yesterday</p>
<p>The Children's Welfare Association Sent a Letter Requesting Strict Action</p>
<p>Mo Xianggan, a native of Shaoxing, took Zhao Sangen, a thirteen-year-old apprentice, who was severely abused by Mo, resulting in death due to injuries. Neighbors complained and demanded a thorough investigation. This case was reported yesterday. It is now heard that the Shanghai Local Court has appointed a prosecutor and an examiner to come for examination. After the examination, a coffin should be prepared for burial. However, the body was delayed until 4:00 PM yesterday before being coffined and buried, causing a stir among the people far and near who came to watch in an endless stream. It is said that the corpse's eyes suddenly protruded, and white foam kept flowing from his mouth, which was very miserable. However, his family is far away in Shaoxing, and they had not yet come to Shanghai by yesterday evening. The Chinese Children's Welfare Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Local Court regarding this matter. The original letter is as follows: Respectfully, on September 26, according to a telephone report, Mo Xianggan, a resident of No. 1, Lane 88, Yujia Lane, Xiaonanmen, Nanshi, privately tortured his apprentice Zhao Sangen to death. Please submit a complaint on our behalf, etc. We sent Wang Guanyi, a member of the Security Department, to investigate. It is said that the body of Zhao Sangen, the apprentice who had been tortured to death, was found lying supine, about to be put into a coffin. He was wearing clothes, and no injuries were visible. However, his face was thin and emaciated, and there were two wounds on his head, with bloodstains still present. When asked, the neighbors said that Mo Xianggan was a silversmith by trade and was cruel by nature. He often used iron hammers for hitting silver to strike his apprentices' heads and used very heavy objects to press them down so that they could not move. He also used very thick ropes to tighten their throats so that they could not shout and often forbade them from eating while still making them work as usual. Zhao Sangen's death was definitely caused by being beaten, and his face was emaciated because he was definitely starved. The wounds on his head were definitely struck by an iron hammer. There were also his close neighbors Zhao Gensheng, Zhou Nanrong, Dong Rongxiang, Dong Rongsheng, Wu Fugao, Wu Shangkui, etc., who jointly submitted a report to the First Branch of the First District, requesting a thorough investigation. Jin, the chief of the branch, prepared a document requesting your court to examine the case and issue a burial permit for the injured who died. Based on this investigation, Shanghai is a commercial center, with shops lined up and factories like forests. The number of child laborers and apprentices is very large. Such inhumanity cannot be tolerated. Since your court has accepted the case, you should apply the appropriate articles of the law. For the sake of protecting children, our association dares to seek redress for the deceased and beg for the lives of the living. We earnestly request your court to handle the matter seriously and make it public as a warning. Our association will represent the children of the whole country and kneel and cry out for justice. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Local Court, Chinese Children's Welfare Association.</p>
<h3>Pitiful Child Pulling a Rickshaw</h3>
<p>Child pulling a rickshaw is strictly prohibited. Recently, the Municipal Public Security Bureau issued an order to its subordinates to strictly crack down on this. It is now found that in the Huxi area, such as Zhoujiaqiao, Beixinjing, and Caojiadu, only damaged rickshaws licensed by the Chinese authorities are still being pulled by Jiangbei children who are only thirteen or fourteen years old and less than three feet tall. Because of their weakness, they are unable to carry passengers, which has caused many dangers. Yesterday afternoon at about 6:00 PM, near Fanhua渡 in Huxi, a child about ten years old was pulling a rickshaw carrying a country woman (about thirty years old) and running. His head was covered in sweat, and he was panting like a bull. Unexpectedly, he accidentally lost his footing and overturned the rickshaw. The country woman in the rickshaw crashed directly into a tree on the side of the road, smashing her head and legs. Bloodstains were everywhere, and her cloth pants were also slightly torn. The child's hand was also slightly injured. Although the woman was very angry and grabbed the child, fortunately, passersby saw that the child was in tears and looked very poor. They persuaded the woman not to give him the fare before letting him go. The woman then walked away reluctantly.</p>

<h3>Sentence Announced in the Case of Selling Daughter into Prostitution</h3>
<p>Each Person Sentenced to Separate Penalties</p>
<p>Xu Feng, a native of Changshu, formerly residing at No. 20, Bing'an Lane, Ailai格 Road, French Concession, had previously promised her twenty-year-old biological daughter, Xu Cizhen, to the couple Ling Boyou and Ling Wu as a child bride. But last month, she colluded with Shen Bingsheng and Li Zhongwen to take Xu Cizhen out and sell her to Zhu Zhang at No. 14, Hongyun Lane, Huage聂 Road, as a prostitute, for a price of 300 yuan, which they divided among themselves. The matter was learned by the French Concession police detectives Hang Guangfu and Ding Wensheng, who considered that Feng and others selling a good woman into prostitution violated the criminal law. They arrested all the above people and took them to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the French Concession Court for investigation. The Western detective chief first reported the previous situation and questioned Xu Feng, who admitted to selling her daughter without denying it. Ling Boyou and Ling Wu confessed that Feng had sold her daughter into prostitution and that they knew about it beforehand and had shared 50 yuan. Shen Bingsheng and Li Zhongwen confessed that they acted as intermediaries for the people and shared dozens of yuan. Zhu Zhang admitted that she had bought the woman to be a prostitute. The Chinese and Western judges ruled that Xu Feng had violated Article 249 of the criminal law and sentenced her to two years in the women's prison. Zhu Zhang was also sentenced to two years. Shen Bingsheng and Li Zhongwen were each sentenced to four months in the Western prison. The Ling Boyou and Ling Wu couple were each sentenced to three months as a warning. Xu Cizhen was ordered to be sent to the Jiliang Institute for matchmaking and was allowed to sever ties with her parents.</p>
<h3>Using Counterfeit Money to Rent a Car</h3>
<p>Zhao Bingxian Carried it Out for a Long Time and Was Exposed</p>
<p>Zhao Bingxian, a native of Zhenjiang, liked to hire cars. He often accompanied two or three young men to car rental companies, giving them ten-yuan banknotes from the Bank of China as payment for the car. The car rental company employees saw that he was dressed in a Western suit and behaved luxuriously, and they did not suspect that he was using counterfeit money. Therefore, they did not carefully check the banknotes he gave them. Even after they discovered the counterfeit money later, there was no way to recover it. Recently, the Donghai Car Company on Pingliang Road was fooled by him several times. It was not until the twenty-fifth that they discovered it on the spot and called the police to arrest Zhao. Detective Jin Yangwu of the Yangshupu police station found out that, in addition to the Donghai Car Company, the Huali on Yangshupu Road, the Gongping on Broadway, the Huishan on Shanxi Road, and the Xinhuishan Car Company had all received counterfeit money from Zhao as car fares. Because Zhao's home was located at the intersection of Pingliang Road and the French Concession, Detective Jin went to search his house, but no counterfeit money was found. Yesterday, he was sent to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Feng interrogated him about the origin of the counterfeit money. However, Zhao completely denied using counterfeit money. However, the employees of each car company all stated that the counterfeit money was indeed paid by the defendant. Judge Feng ordered the defendant to be detained pending further investigation and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Dispute Arising from the Cancellation of an Engagement</h3>
<p>The Bride's Age is Unreliable</p>
<p>The Groom's Family Wants to Cancel the Engagement</p>
<p>Zhou Zhang, a woman from Changshu, is 35 years old and lives in the Rihua Textile Factory workshop in Hefeng Lane, Lujiazui, Pudong. She has a daughter who is 29 years old and works in the Rihua Textile Factory and has not yet been engaged. A neighbor and fellow villager, Ji Wangsheng, and his wife, Ji, acted as matchmakers and promised her daughter to the second son of Lu Shao, who lives nearby. Lu's son is 22 years old, also from Changshu. Both parties were quite satisfied and agreed on an engagement gift of 90 yuan, gold jewelry worth 30 yuan, and various gifts worth 60 yuan. They chose an auspicious day for the "Pan," or engagement ceremony. However, the groom's family recently learned that Zhang's daughter was only 16 years old and that the Eight Characters of her birth were unreliable. They feared that the marriage would not be harmonious and would be detrimental to the family. Therefore, on the afternoon of the other day, they proposed to the original matchmaker to cancel the engagement. However, Ji Wangsheng and his wife firmly refused, saying that the matter had failed before it could be completed. They declared that if they wanted to cancel the engagement, they (referring to the Shao family) should talk to the other party themselves. This caused a major conflict between the two sides. The men and women fought in a group. Shao, who had a pre-existing illness, was pushed to the ground by Ji and could not move. The factory police arrived on the scene and detained the matchmaker Ji Wangsheng and his wife, the girl's mother Zhou Zhang, and the injured Lu Shao. The District Chief of the Third District, considering that the case involved a marital dispute, sent them to the Local Court for questioning yesterday.</p>

It was now found that there were dozens of acres of land in Dachang and other places that were still suitable. It was resolved to purchase them at a reasonable price. Also, as the transportation of coffins to and from the north and south was very busy recently, it was resolved to purchase a new car to facilitate transportation. (2) It was resolved that the temporary plague treatment center attached to the Pushan Villa Pushan Hospital should be closed in the autumn as usual. It was originally planned to close at the end of the month, but due to the frequent occurrence of unrest, the closing date was extended to October 10. If there were any further outbreaks, the treatment would continue. (3) It was proposed that burial in the inland areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang was most important. Last year, the charitable group entrusted Mr. Wang Junsheng to handle the matter, and he was enthusiastic and effective. Mr. Wang worked hard and did not complain. It was requested that he continue to do so. The financial difficulties were also a reality. Everyone should support each other to achieve success. Everyone agreed and passed the proposal unanimously. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>
<h3>YMCA Establishes Huxi Commune</h3>
<p>The Labor Department of the Shanghai YMCA previously established a Labor New Village in Pudong to serve workers. Since its establishment, it has been quite successful. Considering that there are numerous factories and densely populated workers in the Xiaoshadu area of Huxi, with an estimated population of over 40,000, the association has decided to establish a Huxi Commune based on the experience of the Pudong Labor New Village. The project is planned and managed by Mr. Luo Chuanhua, the director of the Labor Department of the association. Land has now been rented at the intersection of Laobosen Road and Xiaoshadu Road to build houses, which will be completed soon. The commune's facilities will focus on worker education and worker health. The Pudong New Village's experience will be used to operate the Huxi Commune smoothly. The future results cannot be measured.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at approximately 2:30 AM, Chen A-long and other detectives from the Songhu Anti-Smuggling Camp discovered a large group of Jiangbei workers carrying a large quantity of steel bars near the Dayang Bridge in the western part of Shanghai. The steel bars were needed for building construction. The workers appeared flustered and secretive. Suspecting that they were carrying the steel late at night for dubious reasons, Chen and his team ordered them to stop for questioning. However, the workers immediately opened fire to resist arrest and abandoned the steel bars as they fled. Chen and his team, outnumbered and facing gunfire (two shots were fired, fortunately missing them), dared not pursue them. They seized the abandoned steel, estimated to weigh over twenty dan. Later, it was discovered that the steel bars were for the construction of buildings inside the Toyota Factory and had been stolen from the nearby Fuxingchang workshop where they were stored.

<h3>Silk Factories Oppose Public Measurement Inspection</h3>
<p>Meeting to be Held Tomorrow to Discuss</p>
<p>Silk factories in the city have been suffering losses due to public measurement since it was introduced. They suffer many losses such as devaluation and being unable to ship on time. They are firmly opposed to it, and the Shanghai Silk Factories Association has sent a letter to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau requesting that the Raw Silk Inspection Office be ordered to stop the public measurement inspection from October 1st, when the trial period ends, in order to protect the silk industry. The Silk Factories Association received a reply from the Commodity Inspection Bureau yesterday, which was immediately communicated to all manufacturers. They all feel that the bureau is disregarding the difficulties of the merchants. Now that the sale of factory silk to Europe has plummeted and the silk industry is facing a crisis of survival, they cannot afford to suffer this unexpected loss. The public is outraged and appeals to the Silk Factories Association to convene a general meeting of all members immediately to discuss further measures to achieve the goal of cancellation. The executive committee of the association has scheduled an emergency meeting of all members for 3 PM on the 29th of this month (tomorrow). A notice has already been issued.</p>
<h3>Famous Russian Cyclist Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>National Competition with Zheng Longfei at Weile Garden Today</p>
<p>Russian cyclist Semashko arrived in Shanghai recently. Today, he will compete against Zheng Longfei, a famous Chinese cyclist, in a national competition at Weile Garden on Dige Road. The competition will consist of two sessions, one during the day and one at night. Both sides are highly skilled and deserve attention. Details of the competition are as follows: "Russian Champion" Semashko holds the Russian and Harbin championship records. He has won countless prizes, both large and small. His life as a cyclist and his outstanding achievements are admirable. He is here in Shanghai during his travels, and he will show his skills at Weile Garden. Sports enthusiasts should not miss this opportunity. "Zheng's Art" Zheng Longfei is a leading cyclist in China and a pillar of Weile Garden. Although he has only been training for five or six months, and it may be difficult to compete with the veteran Russian champion who has accumulated years of experience, he will at least put up a fierce fight against Semashko. "National Competition" The day session will start at 3 PM, and the night session will start at 9 PM. The competition between Semashko and Zheng can be considered a national competition between China and Russia. The excitement and splendor are extraordinary. In addition, there will be various long and short distance cycling races, motorcycle races, and pacing races. There are more than ten events in total. "Student Discounts" Since the arrival of the famous Russian cyclist, students from various schools have wanted to see him in person. They have written to Weile Garden requesting group discount tickets. The staff of the garden, considering the economic situation of the students, have approved that for every Sunday competition, students who present a letter of proof from their school can purchase tickets for 20 cents each, as a gesture of goodwill. However, this is limited to groups. Many students who are interested in practicing cycling are organizing amateur sports classes. The garden will provide free guidance to promote amateur sports and will also give prizes when amateur class competitions are held in the future.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at Shanghai Silk Factory</h3>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau's Mediation Yesterday Yields No Result</p>
<p>The Japanese-owned Shanghai Silk Factory in Caojiadu has been operating for over twenty years and has been very successful. The factory's operations have also gradually expanded. However, on the 17th of this month, a dispute suddenly arose between labor and management, leading to a work slowdown. Party and government agencies have been mediating, but the management's attitude has been extremely tough, making it difficult to reach an agreement. The negotiations eventually broke down. Recently, the management realized that the shutdown was not a good idea and wrote to the Social Affairs Bureau asking them to mediate again. The Social Affairs Bureau summoned both parties for talks and held a mediation session. Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, the second mediation meeting was held. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Causes of the Dispute: The cause of the dispute between labor and management was the factory's unwarranted reduction of workers' wages, without prior approval from the Party and government. The female workers expressed their dissatisfaction, stating that at a time when the cost of living is rising, other factories are increasing wages. This factory not only does not increase wages, but also wants to reduce them. It has been found that the factory has reduced wages four times in the past few years. The initial wage for each piece of silk was 1 yuan and 10 cents, but it has now been reduced to 36.7 cents. The workers have been silently enduring this, but now the factory wants to reduce it by another 40%, leaving only 22 cents. This has led to widespread opposition, while the factory's attitude remains tough and shows no sign of retreat.</p>
<p>Post-Dispute Mediation: After the labor dispute occurred, Ren Luping, the director of the Sixth District Public Security Bureau, feared that the incident would escalate and repeatedly summoned both parties for mediation, but to no avail. The female workers unanimously expressed their work slowdown starting on the 17th of last month. The Social Affairs Bureau also sent personnel to mediate, but the management showed no sincerity, and the dispute became unresolved. However, the management has now realized the situation and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is continuing to mediate in order to resolve the matter as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Labor's Demands: The labor unrest was purely caused by management's unwarranted wage reduction. Therefore, labor feels that management should bear the responsibility, and the conditions put forward are: (1) Restore the original wage per piece of silk; (2) Wages should be paid as usual during the strike; (3) Workers should not be dismissed without reason; (4) Workers should be allowed to wash before leaving work; (5) Wages should not be arbitrarily fined; (6) Make up for the wages deducted for one month; (7) Allow the organization of a labor union; (8) Wages for substandard raw materials should be paid according to the daily wage; (9) Dismiss the stooge Chen Xiuzhen.</p>
<p>Attendees: The attendees yesterday included Xu Zhi from the Social Affairs Bureau, Wang or Xian, representing the Public Security Bureau, Wang Zhixin, as the recorder, Tang Jinying, Gu Jinmei, Zhu Ying, and Wang Maozhen representing the labor side, and Amano, a Japanese national, Ya Shishuo, Inoue Shinpei, and Chen Renlin, a Chinese translator, representing management.</p>
<p>Mediation Process: Yesterday's mediation used a separate consultation method. Representatives from the two municipal bureaus repeatedly enlightened the management, and the management agreed to increase the original wage reduction of 40% by one-third. However, they firmly refused other items such as paying wages during the strike and stated that if the labor side insisted on an increase, they would rather close the factory.</p>
<p>Labor's Concessions: The two representatives of the government informed the labor side of the management's attitude. The labor side insisted on the previous demands but expressed a willingness to compromise on the wage reduction, but insisted that it must still be at least 30 cents per piece. Otherwise, they would insist to the end and would never be subdued by the management.</p>
<p>Meeting Results: Since the attitudes of both parties were so irreconcilable, the two representatives of the government solemnly declared that since the two parties were so irreconcilable, the matter would have to be submitted to the municipal government for arbitration. Upon hearing this, the Japanese national stated that he was willing to reconsider. In the end, the Japanese national volunteered to convene labor representatives for direct discussion and then report to the Social Affairs Bureau. He also inquired with the Social Affairs Bureau representatives about the procedures for closing the factory. Mr. Xu informed him that if he wanted to close the factory, he would have to follow the labor union law and pay severance pay to the workers based on their years of service, one month's salary for each year of service, and half a month's salary for each year of service for those with more than ten years of service. If the factory is temporarily closed, it should not exceed two months at most and should pay each worker one-third of their wages. As for the direct negotiations between the factory and the labor force, the labor representative must have more than seventy people to be legal. Finally, the management agreed to reply on Monday before dispersing.</p>
<h3>Explanation of Interest on Shareholders' Dividends</h3>
<p>No Interest Paid if Not Claimed After Notification</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Hatters Association yesterday, stating in response to the previous letter inquiring whether interest should be paid on dividends due to shareholders of commercial firms if they are not claimed in a timely manner. After a detailed investigation by designated personnel, it has been found that it is customary in this city that shareholders of commercial firms are entitled to receive dividends as soon as they receive the dividend statement or notification slip. If they delay claiming the dividends, it means that they have voluntarily given up their rights, and there is no possibility of paying interest. Moreover, after the commercial firm has allocated dividends, the funds are stored in cash to await payment and cannot be used for other purposes, nor can there be any possibility of doing business. A corresponding letter is hereby issued in reply, for your reference.</p>

Recently, the branch submitted the reply from the Party Department and a copy of the original report from the bureau to the China Seamen's Union for forwarding to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, urgently requesting the ministry to send a special commissioner to inspect Xiang, E, Chuan, Wan, and Gan and the Hankou Municipal Government to seriously negotiate with the American consul in Hankou in accordance with the post-settlement methods of abolishing the negotiation bureau, in order to obtain punishment for the murderer and compensation for the deceased.

<p>The organizing committee of the Cigarette Industry Union League corrected the fact that the seventh standing committee meeting the day before yesterday was chaired by Gu Ruofeng and was due to the deletion of the words "attending for guidance" when the publication was made, which was wrongly taken as Zhang Yaoming being the chairman.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, I have read the report in the local news section of your newspaper on the 26th of this month that Li Zhen, the assistant engineer of the Jiangsu Electric Power Management Office of the Construction Department, came to the county on the 21st of this month to inspect the long-distance telephone in the North Ma section. This is not true. The telephone in the North Ma section of the county was inspected by personnel from the Construction Department on August 21st, not on the 21st of this month. I am afraid that this is a false rumor. I hereby declare this and hope that it will be published in the letters column to show the truth. Shanghai County Construction Bureau September 26</p>

<p>Principals of Primary and Secondary Schools in Jiangsu Province</p>
<h3>Petition for Collective Resignation</h3>
<p>Regarding the Assistance of the Abduction of the Principal of Suqian Middle School</p>
<p>Ren Zhongmin, Xie Jizeng, and forty other principals of provincial middle and primary schools in Jiangsu Province, regarding the case of Xiao Mingqin, the principal of Suqian Middle School, being unreasonably beaten and robbed by the garrison troops, for more than a month, the military and political authorities have not yet taken any considerable measures of punishment. They feel that principals have no protection when performing their duties, and everyone is in danger. Therefore, a few days ago, all the principals held a meeting in Zhenjiang and decided to resign collectively to express their support and to urge the military and political authorities to severely punish the officers and soldiers who committed the crime as soon as possible to uphold justice. Yesterday, the letter of resignation was sent to the Department of Education after being signed and sealed by all forty principals. The original letter is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The petition is regarding the arbitrary looting of public funds and property by garrison troops, and the harming of public officials. Afterwards, there is no progress in punishment, and instead, there is retaliation. With power prevailing and justice not upheld, people feel endangered and education has no protection. We cannot maintain our positions and respectfully request approval to resign and the appointment of capable individuals. According to the case investigation, on August 19th, Xiao Mingqin, the principal of Suqian Middle School, was returning to school from the provincial capital on official business and was intercepted in Qingjiangpu by troops under Huang Meixing, the head of the 266th Regiment of the 133rd Brigade of the garrison. He was falsely accused of being a bandit, severely beaten, and paraded through the streets, losing the school seal and more than a thousand yuan of school funds. A petition had already been submitted to your department for forwarding to the provincial government and a detailed report to the military authorities, requesting a thorough investigation, severe punishment of the perpetrators, and compensation, as well as strict orders to all troops in the province to provide real protection for public officials in order to respect education and uphold the law. Afterwards, Principal Xiao repeatedly received instructions from your department and resolutions from the provincial government to order the brigade to punish the perpetrators and provide compensation separately. However, Liu Hanzhen, the brigade commander, according to the report of Huang Meixing, the regimental commander, completely denied the past facts of the case, falsely accusing Principal Xiao of beating soldiers and embezzling public funds, fabricating facts and defaming his reputation. The regimental commander even disregarded the law, giving the chairman of the provincial government one week to summon the parties for confrontation, or else he would take appropriate measures. The brigade commander also immediately forwarded the document and stated, "Confirmation by telegram is accurate," without any hesitation. The provincial government, regarding the reports from both sides, issued instructions to your department for a thorough investigation, but did not order the responsible military authorities to take responsibility. It is heard that your department has ordered the magistrate of Huaiyin County to investigate, but the county magistrate is facing many obstacles under the coercion of the regiment. How can he conduct a thorough investigation? At the same time, it is also heard that the regimental commander in Huaiyin has already intimidated all those who rescued Principal Xiao on that day and those who were identified as witnesses in Principal Xiao's submission, forcing them to testify against Principal Xiao and falsely claim that the entire incident was fabricated. If all these rumors are true, it is unknown what kind of effective measures the provincial government and your department will take regarding this case. It has been more than a month since the incident occurred. Principal Xiao has been recuperating from his injuries in the province and is gradually recovering, but the brain injury is too severe and it is uncertain whether he will fully recover. Because Suqian is close to the bandit suppression area of the regiment, and the regiment is unpredictable and tyrannical, there is no protection for personal safety once one enters the area. Therefore, while being concerned about the school, with the start of the school year and numerous affairs awaiting management, it is impossible to return to the school to perform duties. Even Huaiyin Middle School, Agricultural School, and other schools in Jiangbei, within or near the sphere of influence of the brigade and regiment, are constantly wary of this ferocious force and feel personally endangered, unable to serve with peace of mind. The fact that public officials are traveling on official business within the province, carrying public funds and property, is a common occurrence in all schools. Since the brigade and regiment belong to the National Revolutionary Army, where is the Heavenly duty to the people? How should their behavior and actions be different from bandits? After the incident, in terms of solving people's difficulties and upholding the law, what should be the difference between the situation in the revolutionary era and the situation in the warlord era? Considering the current situation, it is difficult to achieve any results in this case. The lives of public officials in the education sector of the entire province have no protection. We cannot maintain our positions and respectfully request approval to resign and the appointment of capable individuals. Respectfully presented to Chen, the Director of the Department of Education.</p>
<h3>Explanation by the Ministry of Education on the Differences in Registration of Universities, Middle Schools, and Elementary Schools</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, according to a report from the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education, stated that the Ministry had issued an order stating that school operators in various regions were neglecting regulations, resulting in many errors. Therefore, the key points of various regulations were selected and announced to the public for compliance to avoid errors. The announcement was issued to the Department for compliance and to inform the relevant departments for compliance and reporting for inspection. Upon investigation, the first section of the announcement, the procedure for reporting schools at all levels, item three, stated that after the board of directors has been approved for registration, it should immediately refer to the regulations, specifically Articles 20 and 24, and according to the level of the school established, follow the procedures listed in the regulations to submit an application for the establishment of the school, an application for the opening of the school, and an application for the registration of the school three years after the opening. However, the procedures stipulated in Article 20 of the Regulations for Private Schools are limited to private universities, independent colleges, and specialized schools. The procedures stipulated in Article 24 are limited to private secondary schools and higher schools. The statement in item three of the first section of the announcement, "Apply for school registration three years after opening," seems to encompass both Article 20 and Article 24 of the regulations, but it does not clearly distinguish between the three-year registration period for private universities, etc., and the one-year registration period for higher schools. As a result, many private middle and primary schools in various regions mistakenly believe that middle and primary schools must also wait for three years after opening before applying for registration. How should this be clearly explained or modified to avoid misguidance in handling? A document has been prepared to submit to your department for review and instructions for compliance. The Ministry of Education instructed the department, stating that the six characters "three years after opening" in item three of the first section of Announcement No. 3 of the Ministry refer specifically to private universities, independent colleges, and specialized schools. Because the original text regarding the registration period for private middle and primary schools was not explained and was easily confusing, the six characters "three years after opening" in this announcement were deleted in the compilation of the "Current Important Educational Laws and Regulations" published by the Ministry, page 160 of the General Rules. The registration period for private schools of all types should be handled in accordance with Articles 20 and 24 of the Regulations for Private Schools. You are hereby informed and instructed to inform all subordinates accordingly.</p>
<h3>President of Wuhan University Resigns as Legislator</h3>
<p>Since the National Government decided that one could not hold dual positions, important figures such as Jiang Menglin, Cai Yuanpei, and Dai Chuanxian have successively resigned from their concurrent positions as university presidents. Zheng Hongnian, Vice Minister of Industry and Commerce, resigned as Vice Minister to dedicate himself to his position as President of Jinan University. Recently, Wang Shijie, President of Wuhan University, has repeatedly telegraphed Dean Hu Zhantang to resign from his concurrent position as a member of the Legislative Yuan to dedicate himself to his position as university president. Under these circumstances, since dual positions are not allowed, it is heard that Tao Xuan, President of Zhonghua School in Nanjing and concurrent member of the Legislative Yuan, will also resign from one of his positions to dedicate himself to the other.</p>

<h3>Sports Promotion Association Should Apply for Registration with the Municipal Education Bureau</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, the Ministry of Education instructed the bureau, stating that the submission and attachments had been reviewed. Article 1 of the Measures for the Education Administrative Organs to Manage Academic Groups stipulates that "an academic group shall, in addition to complying with the provisions of the General Principles of the Civil Law and other laws and regulations, handle matters in accordance with these measures." Furthermore, the supplementary item of Article 7 of Section 3 of the Revised Scheme for the Organization of People's Groups stipulates that "Social groups shall comply with the provisions of special laws and regulations if there are special laws and regulations." Since the China National Sports Promotion Association is an academic group in nature, it should apply for registration with the bureau in accordance with the Measures for the Education Administrative Organs to Manage Academic Groups, in addition to fulfilling other required procedures. The request to forward the inquiry to the Ministry of Interior Affairs should not be discussed.</p>

<h3>Chinese Win Two Championships at the Grass Court Tennis Tournament</h3>
<p>Lin Qiu win Men's Doubles | Li Xinghua wins Women's Singles |</p>
<h3>(1) Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai Win Doubles Championship</h3>
<p>Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai defeated Smith and Buddy yesterday at the French Club. The final result of the Shanghai Open Grass Court Doubles Tennis Championship was 7-5, 6-1, 6-3. Lin and Qiu won the championship. The umpire was Mr. White.</p>
<h3>| Match Details |</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Grass Court Doubles Championship began in 1911 and has been held for twenty years. In recent years, Chinese players have participated, but have failed to win the championship. This year, with the addition of Lin and Qiu, they have been invincible from the beginning and won the championship, bringing glory to the Chinese tennis world. Yesterday's final victory was quite easy.</p>
<p>The first set of the match was originally scheduled to begin at 2:30 PM, but because Lin Baohua arrived late, the match began at 3:00 PM. Lin arrived in a hurry and was unable to warm up comfortably, resulting in a significant reduction in his performance. Qiu Feihai was also affected by this and lost three consecutive games, causing dissatisfaction among the audience. Fortunately, from then on, their spirits were slightly revived, and they worked together wholeheartedly, leveling the score in an instant. After that, both sides competed tensely. The American team took the lead, and the Chinese team followed closely, keeping pace and refusing to give in. After 5-5, Lin's net play was ingenious and varied, and Qiu responded by consolidating the rear defense, making it impossible for the opponent to find any flaws. As a result, Lin and Qiu won 7-5.</p>
<p>In the second set, Lin and Qiu regained their original form, and all kinds of hitting techniques were skillful. In contrast, the opponents were flustered and frequently lost points. In an instant, they won four consecutive games. Smith and Buddy tried hard to counterattack and won back one game. Lin and Qiu continued to win two more games, and as a result, they won again 6-1.</p>
<p>In the third set, Lin and Qiu won the first game, and then Smith and Buddy took a 2-1 lead. Lin and Qiu added two games to take a 3-2 lead. Smith then struggled to catch up, only to tie the score. As a result, Lin and Qiu won 6-3. The final result was 3-0, and Lin and Qiu won the championship. Afterwards, Howard, the president of the Grass Court Tennis Club, presented two large silver trophies to Lin and Qiu, which they will keep for one year. The names of the two people are engraved on it as a historical commemoration.</p>

<h3>(2) Li Xinghua Wins Women's Singles Championship</h3>
<p>Unprecedented in the Shanghai Chinese Women's Tennis World</p>
<p>Defeated Feisi yesterday with a score of 6-4, 4-6, 7-5</p>
<p>In the final of the Shanghai Grass Court Tennis Club's Women's Open Singles Championship, our country's Li Xinghua played against Feisi at the French Club yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. As a result, Xinghua defeated Fei with a score of 6-4, 4-6, 7-5, winning the Grass Court Tennis Club's Women's Singles Championship.</p>

<p>Siezed the Championship, creating a new era in the Shanghai Chinese women's tennis world, and also a new record in the Grass Court Women's Singles Championship in eighteen years.</p>
<h3>| Li and Fei's Skills |</h3>
<p>Looking at the two players' skills, there is really no great difference. Xinghua is known for her agility and calmness, while Feisi wins with strength, and can use various hitting methods. Xinghua's backhand stroke is slightly weak, but her forehand stroke and chop shot are quite confident. The two fought fiercely. Xinghua was repeatedly in danger, but it was not easy to calmly and painstakingly turn the situation around. The more than three hundred spectators present were initially terrified for Ms. Li in the midst of the storm, but were finally able to celebrate her victory, which was even more gratifying and commendable. The umpire was Lin Baohua.</p>
<p>In the first set, Li Xinghua served first. The two returned the ball from the baseline, cautiously and without letting go. Xinghua took the lead, being agile and extraordinary, winning three consecutive games and creating an excellent opportunity. Feisi was unwilling to be outdone and quickly caught up. Xinghua also kept pace. The two had their own achievements, comparing from 3-0 to 5-3 and then to 5-4. Xinghua always had the upper hand, but Feisi's counter-attack was also very strong. The result of this set was Xinghua winning 6-4.</p>
<p>In the second set, Xinghua served and still won the first game. Feisi also added one game. In the third game, the two volleyed at the net, fighting bravely. After 2-2, Feisi's momentum suddenly increased, with her strokes to the left and right being very effective, causing Xinghua to run around and create a return with Feisi in the lead. Xinghua carefully fought back, like a piece of beef jerky. Feisi could not stand the battle and repeatedly extinguished her own power with improper force. Xinghua then caught up with two games, making it four each. At that time, Xinghua's ball momentum was very good, with a feeling of accomplishing everything in one breath. Unexpectedly, she lost the next game due to carelessness, resulting in a loss of 4-5. At this important juncture, Xinghua was extremely persistent and determined to retaliate. In the tenth game, Xinghua repeatedly faced dangerous situations, but was finally able to maintain a balanced situation. This game was fought for a total of 26 points before the victory was decided, with a score of 14-12 going to Feisi. As a result, the victory of this set also went to Feisi with a score of 6-4.</p>
<p>With the sets tied, the third set became a life-and-death decisive battle. The competition was fierce and the situation was tense. Xinghua still served first and won the first game. Feisi won two consecutive games to take a 2-1 lead. Xinghua also added two games. Feisi won again, becoming 4-3, and then 4-4. Xinghua followed closely behind. Suddenly, Feisi was about to win again with 5-4. In the next game, Xinghua was at a disadvantage with a score of 1-3. With only one point left, she was about to lose the whole game. At this critical moment, Xinghua suffered and persevered, escaping death and making it 5-5. The audience held their breath and broke out in a sweat. Afterwards, Xinghua seemed to see the sun after a rainstorm and her spirits were greatly boosted. On the contrary, Feisi seemed to be something in a bag that was taken away by others, feeling extremely frustrated. Xinghua took this opportunity to win two consecutive games and win the final victory with 7-5. After the match, the trophies were still presented by Howard, who said that Ms. Li's victory in this championship was truly a new era for Chinese women's tennis and was very commendable. Then, the silver cup was presented to Xinghua, and there was thunderous applause for a while. Xinghua shook hands with Lin Baohua, Qiu Feihai, and the Westerner Mr. White, and they all congratulated her.</p>

However, Guo Qida was courageous and skilled, and his running and parrying were meticulous. With shrewd fighting, he won two consecutive games, resulting in a score of 7-5 and winning a set. From the second set onwards, Tang and Gong continued to shoot from afar, and Guo and Lu responded with attacks from the front and back, each showing their full skills and maintaining a stalemate.

<h3>Kang Youwei's Discussion on Foot Binding</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>Mr. Kang Youwei of Nanhai was outstanding in his articles, economic insight, and knowledge. He died in frustration because his reform failed. Occasionally reading his disciples' collected drafts of the 1898 reform, although only a dozen articles were collected, the novelty of his thoughts and the fluency of his arguments were enough to shock the ignorant. I once saw his memorial requesting the prohibition of women's foot binding, in which he described the suffering of women's foot binding in great detail. It said, "As soon as they are weaned and their hair has not dried, their muscles have not grown, and their bones have not hardened, their weak feet are bound horizontally with three feet of cloth and seven feet of ribbon. They bend their fingers to make them walk, break their bones to make them bend, and walk timidly and crouchingly on the ground. The young girls suffer and cry day and night, and some add medicine water to fumigate them day and night with narrow socks and small shoes that cannot be taken off at night, so as to make them bend without stretching and slender without strengthening. They get up by leaning on the bed and walk by leaning against the wall. The rich suffer from it, and the poor suffer even more. They personally operate the well and hold the mortar, take care of the weak children, and serve the sick mother-in-law. They come and go to report and run without stopping. When they go to deep places and climb high places, they sigh and sigh with sorrow and cover their faces with tears. Some fall to their deaths because of climbing ladders, and some are injured because of illness. As for water and fire, when there is chaos and they have to flee for their lives, carrying their husbands, holding their children, and carrying things and clothes, it is impossible to cross the streams and difficult to climb the high peaks. The roads are blocked by chaotic rocks and the clothes are hooked by thorns. Many hang themselves from trees and abandon their lives or fall from buildings and die." The description is so detailed and meticulous, truly the work of a genius.</p>
<h3>Random Jottings from the Xuyuan Garden</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>Last Sunday, Little Butterfly was not back from Hangzhou, so I attended the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Factory on her behalf and had some thoughts. I will try to describe them below. Since the import of foreign goods, our country's native cloth has been overshadowed and has no place to stand. Many people have lost their jobs, which has had a regrettable impact on society. Now, if people in various villages and counties raise three to five thousand taels of silver to specialize in buying native cloth and transport it to Shanghai for artistic printing and dyeing, then its sales and uses will certainly not be inferior to Russian chintz. Although the texture is extremely rough, once it is printed and dyed, it can be transformed from ugliness to beauty, and it is durable. The cost of printing and dyeing each foot is only about one cent, which can be said to be extremely cheap. However, in terms of printing and dyeing, the machines run very fast, and they can print and dye about 300,000 feet per day. However, it takes a lot of time to change a printing plate, so it is most cost-effective to print 3,000 bolts of ten feet each. Otherwise, at least 600 bolts must be printed at a time. However, if it is distributed by counties, it can be matched evenly. For example, if sixty counties buy native cloth and specialize in this printed fabric business, they can gather in one factory for printing and dyeing, and the factory can be asked to match the colors. If each county has 600 bolts, the total number of sixty counties is 36,000 bolts, which can be printed and dyed in just half a month. The average distribution of each color means that each county can get 60 kinds of colors, with only ten bolts of each kind, to supply half a month of sales. The daily sales volume is only 40 bolts, which is about 4,000 feet in terms of feet. If the amount needed per person is ten feet, it can only supply the needs of 400 people. Assuming a year of durability, the county's population of 140,000 to 150,000 is enough to meet the demand, without having to seek external supply. The amount of native cloth sold and used in the local area each year can reach about 14,000 to 15,000 bolts. If we assume that each foot earns a profit of five li, then each bolt can earn a profit of five jiao, and the annual surplus profit can be more than 7,000 yuan. With a capital of three to five thousand yuan, such a surplus profit can be obtained. Even if money is borrowed for business, the monthly interest on 5,000 yuan is only 600 yuan. The remaining profit is still 6,000 yuan, which can be paid off in one year, which is quite easy. It would be even more appropriate to prepare new-style wooden machines and distribute them to weaving households to obtain uniform products. As for the bleaching and refining project, the printing and dyeing factory is responsible for its associated responsibility, so there is no need to seek self-reliance. In the past, when I tried to run the Butterfly Clothing Printed Silk Factory on a small scale, many counties sent letters asking to print native cloth, but the printing costs were not cost-effective, so I could not fulfill their wishes. Thinking about it now, the above plan can become a reality. There is no shortage of people in various counties who care about industry and are anxious to take action for the livelihood of women in their hometowns. Moreover, the printed colors can be guaranteed not to fade, and simple dyeing or bleaching or extracting white flowers from the entire surface is even simpler. It is best to print native cloth as willow crepe or wool-like, slightly like the newly released Freedom Cloth from the Sanyou Society, so that all the blemishes are covered by the colors, and it is suitable for both Chinese and Western clothing. Alternatively, it can be printed as the flower chintz style used on furniture and woodenware, taking its durability and beauty to replace coarse twill cloth, so that its sales will also be wide and will surely be welcomed by society. The factory is currently printing and dyeing machine-woven products and has not yet touched native cloth. I have this feeling, but I am afraid that there will be many people who are eager for quick success and few who sympathize.</p>
<h3>Minor Recipes</h3>
<p>— Yang Yixiao</p>
<p>Grape Balls: Take fresh grapes, remove the pits, dry them in the sun, mix them with flour, and fry them in oil until golden brown on both sides. They are sweet and sour and delicious.</p>
<p>Pomegranate Zongzi: Open the pomegranate, remove the skin, take the seeds, wrap them with glutinous rice in reed leaves. Pomegranates are a symbol of having many children. Wrapping this zongzi is most suitable for sending to the wedding of a Qian family.</p>
<p>Lily Crisps: Put lilies in a pottery pot, stew them on a charcoal stove until they are well cooked, then stir-fry them with dry flour and lard, mix them well, add a little white sugar and dried fruit, and knead them into crisps. They are exceptionally soft and loose.</p>
<p>Banana Rice: Peel the bananas, put them in a stone mortar, and mash them with a pestle. Take glutinous rice and lard, put them in a large bowl, steam them until cooked, and then add longan meat and other ingredients on the outside. The flavor is quite beautiful.</p>
<h3>A Record of Visiting Chen's Farming and Reading Garden</h3>
<p>— Li Shi</p>
<p>I have heard the name of Chen's Farming and Reading Garden for a long time and have wanted to visit it, but I have not been able to find a companion. On the seventh day of this month, I was invited by Mr. Chen Cuiheng and Mr. Xu Juying, so I went with Mr. Chen Junjie, Zhifen, and more than 20 members of the Youth Federation.</p>
<p>The garden is located in Jiangwan, thirty miles north of Shanghai, far from the city and isolated from the noise. The gate faces a small stream, the water of which is clear and can reflect objects. The garden has many mountains, and the mountains have many trees of different kinds. The garden has many ponds, and the ponds are full of blooming water chestnuts and lotus, which are splendid and dazzling. When the breeze comes, the flowers and leaves sway, and the ripples ripple. One can relax and enjoy oneself while traveling in it. Mr. Chen farms and reads here and has found his place. Then, after going around the garden, we rested under a pavilion. There were many stones around the pavilion, and the stones were stacked to form a mountain, which was towering and high. Some of my companions sat on the top of the mountain, some lay under the pavilion, some got up and ran races, and some leaned and sang songs. The forms were different, and the attitudes were different. Later, Mr. Chen Hongguang initiated a game of placing forty kinds of miscellaneous objects on the table, each person was limited to observing them for two minutes, and after reading, they wrote down what they had read one by one, limited to fifteen minutes to turn in the papers. The one who remembered the most kinds without errors would get an apple and a pear. In the end, Mr. Chen Gunian won the prize with 30 kinds. Immediately, laughter and applause rose one after another. It was noon, so we took out the fruits we had brought and shared them together. After eating, we strolled on the lawn, which was as green as a carpet. Occasionally, we heard the melodious music and the mournful sound of insects, which had a special meaning. Suddenly, the sound of the bugle was made in succession, so we went back to our seats together. Mr. Chen Suikang suggested making a humorous question and answer. If the answer matched the answer in the question, a banana would be awarded. The fun was unconstrained, and the imagination was wonderful. After that, he initiated a competition to take notes from each other. For example, four people, A, B, C, and D, stood at a distance of about two zhang (approximately 20 ft) from each other. An impartial person took a section of an article and read it aloud twice. A heard it and told it to B, B told it to C, C told it to D, and D recorded it one by one and handed it over to the impartial person. The winner was determined by the speed of the time and the number of typos. This kind of mutual transmission of notes can be said to be a wonderful way to pass the time. Then, the sun set in the west, and our pleasure came to an end, so we returned. After returning, my heart lingered, as if I was still attached to the beauty of the mountains, rivers, forests, and valleys, and I could not let go for several days, so I wrote this down with a pen.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on the Great Catastrophe in Changsha (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Litian</p>
<p>I remember that there was a candy shop run by a father and son in a street in Caichao Gate. They had been in business for many years, but someone reported that they were very wealthy. The Red Army Division and Department sent people to arrest the father and extort 12,000 yuan. The son was so anxious that he could not think of any way. He calculated that if he could sell all the shops and land, he could only get more than 4,000 yuan, and who would want to buy these real properties at that time? So, crying, he ran to the Red Army Headquarters to explain that he was willing to hand over all his property and ask to release his father. The Red Army refused. He even volunteered to redeem his father with his own body, but the Red Army still refused. Two days later, they killed the old man in his sixties.</p>
<p>The spear squad was even more ferocious in killing people because they did not kill people quickly and happily in one fell swoop, but stabbed a few spears casually. There were also several different shapes of spears, and the most deadly was the spear with a hook. When this kind of spear was stabbed into the chest and abdomen, the heart, liver, and internal organs would be torn out. It was pitiful that the head was on the neck and could not be out of breath for a while. Those who were killed with spears had to be delayed for at least several hours or even more than ten hours before they died. On Zhongshan Road, a middle-aged woman holding a child was killed in this way. The child was snatched away by the spear squad, and the woman screamed in pain on the road for half a day before she died.</p>
<p>All retired civil and military officials and people with some property were among those who were searched and killed. These searches and killings, except for some very famous ones, relied on the denunciation of local thugs. Among them, there were indeed many who sought revenge, but even more innocent people had their entire families searched and killed. The most incomprehensible thing was probably the mansion of a certain public figure who was very famous in Hunan. His house was very large and known to everyone, but this time the communists not only did not burn or loot this only large mansion, but also posted a notice on the door: "Anyone who burns or robs this house will be executed by the Third Army of the Red Army."</p>
<p>Commander-in-chief Peng Dehuai" It is said that this notice was very responsible, and indeed the mansion of a certain public figure stood alone.</p>
<h3>Brief Biographies of Overseas Chinese in San Francisco (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Kang Kang</p>
<p>Within ten steps, there must be fragrant grass; in a village of ten households, there must be loyal and trustworthy people. Moreover, there are more than 20,000 overseas Chinese in San Francisco, who have multiplied and thrived for three or four generations, and talented people emerge in large numbers, making it difficult to count them all. However, most of them return to their motherland or are distributed to various countries. Here, I will only briefly mention a few people who live in the overseas Chinese area for a long time and are quite prestigious, just to give a glimpse of an example.</p>
<p>Tang Bang: Those who travel in the overseas Chinese area of San Francisco cannot but take Shenfa Company as the center of their destination. Shenfa is the earliest and largest bone and Su department store here. Its architecture slightly imitates the Chinese style and has the beauty of tall pavilions and flying eaves. The owner is Tang Bang from Taishan County. He is over seventy years old, obese and hunched over. His crown and shoes are simple and plain. Those who see him do not know that he is a millionaire. The store sells Chinese goods of all sizes, but in recent years, it has also mixed in Japanese goods. There are dozens of young girls as receptionists, wearing gorgeous Chinese costumes that illuminate the wayfarers. His daughters and granddaughters, more than a dozen of them, are all stunning beauties. Last year, due to international love issues, the newspapers advertised and the court litigated, and it is still unresolved. It is said that Mr. Tang, although he is extremely frugal in his own lifestyle, has many internal pets, and there are many illegitimate children who are raised and nourished, filling the family. The property disputes in the future should be even more intense.</p>
<p>Zhou Song: Among the new generation of capitalists in the overseas Chinese community, Zhou Song from Xiangshan should be regarded as the best. Fifteen years ago, he was still an employee in a clothing store. He established a Yiyuan Company, specializing in selling men's and women's clothing and supplies, with a value of no more than one yuan. He started his business with this and became rich. Now he has established more than a hundred branches in California, and there are agents, brokers, factories, and stores in various western provinces. A total of 7,000 Chinese men and women are employed, all of whom are from Xiangshan. Westerners also call him Zhou. He is only in his forties, generous, and likes to give alms. He is generous in donating to public welfare and private friendships. Those who know him and those who do not know him praise him a lot.</p>
<p>Lin Huayao: The most progressive group in the overseas Chinese community is the Tongyuan Association, which is the general agency for Chinese Americans. The one who has been in charge of it from beginning to end is Mr. Lin Huayao. He grew up in this country and has never attended school, but he is fluent in both Chinese and English. In the past twenty years, the Tongyuan Association has leaped to occupy a leading commercial position in the United States and internationally. Mr. Lin has contributed a lot. At present, the Tongyuan Association has a self-built auditorium, which is magnificent and worth 100,000 yuan. It has a Chinese newspaper, the Jinshan Times, which has the most fair comments and the widest circulation. It has Chinese American lawyers who specialize in handling cases involving Chinese and American citizens. Recently, it has won the right for the wives and children of citizens to enter the country freely from Washington. It has also passed a motion to establish an overseas Chinese library and compile textbooks for overseas Chinese public schools. The future is bright and the business is booming.</p>
<p>Deng Zuyin: Mr. Deng is the general manager of the Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce here. He studied at Peking University, so he can speak Mandarin. He is young and talented, and his heroic spirit is compelling. He participates in all overseas Chinese affairs. He is good at communication and has a long mouth. All parties are courteous and thorough. This year, in order to expand the Tung Wah Hospital, he plans to hold an overseas Chinese carnival on the Double Tenth Festival. The plan is unprecedentedly grand. If his proposal can be implemented, the publicity effect will be greater than that of the overseas Chinese area, and the commercial impact should be good.</p>
<p>Wu Panzhao: Mr. Wu came to the United States as a child laborer fifty years ago, working in a church and selling newspapers. He was talented and gradually became proficient in Chinese and Western languages. He was especially good at oral communication. In his middle age, he started his own small newspaper, was appointed as a teacher, and gradually rose to his current position as the owner and general manager of the Chinese and Western Daily. He is also the only English orator in the overseas Chinese community. He is a specially appointed speaker for American speaking groups, traveling around the provinces once a year, with an income of no less than 10,000 yuan. Mr. Wu is the most humorous. His speech does not rely on learning or knowledge, but specializes in amusement, and is extremely popular with the audience. He is a person of the same type as Chunyu Dongfang. His sons and daughters, several of whom have graduated from university and obtained higher degrees, have become richer and richer, and their prospects are bright, all of which have been obtained from their tongues. It is due to talent and also to good luck.</p>
<p>Wu Xianzi: The World Daily, a constitutionalist party organ here, has openly opposed the Kuomintang and the current government from beginning to end. Its editor-in-chief is Wu Xianzi, whose real name is Zhuang, and whose hao is Mengdie. He is a top student of Kang Nanhai. His arguments are lively, and his writing is sharp. He can write ten thousand words a day. Those who oppose him avoid him. His purpose is another matter. If we talk about the article from the perspective of the article, there is really no enemy in the overseas Chinese newspaper industry. Mr. Wu has a good understanding of Chinese classics and adheres to the doctrines of the modern classics school. In addition to newspaper essays and writing, he is also very rich in writing. His energy is extraordinary, which is rare outside of Liang Rengong.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>The Rise in Financial and Gold Markets Has Stopped</h3>
<p>With slight changes, it was once sharp. The bidding market on the 27th had some changes. It was weak in the morning and flat at noon. It was once sharp, but there was only a difference of one or two taels. The difference between the high and low ends of the market was more than six taels. Foreign exchange seemed to be tight. Banks traded with each other willingly, and there were not few. The market was weak and buying and selling among peers was not weak. However, it was uncertain and the transactions were divergent, and people's hearts were floating. Yuan Mao Yong Yu, Da Zhi Feng Yong Chun Fa Yong, etc. had inconsistent receipts and payments. Yuan Xing Yong Shunli Xie Yu, etc. all bought in. The large bars of silver in the early market only fell by one-eighth and were not moved. The gold price opened low. After that, buyers followed one after another, and the foreign exchange also looked good. Therefore, it rose sharply, and it was estimated that it rose by more than six taels. At noon, sellers suddenly rose, and the exchange rate seemed to be letting go, so it turned sharply downstream, falling by three or four taels. Later, because it was Saturday, the market was closed according to the usual practice.</p>
<p>The morning opened low and fell by nine qian to November. The opening price in the early market was 552 taels and one qian, a drop of nine qian. It was because the silver price fell slightly. The European market seemed to be hard, and the United States still had the psychology of rescuing the silver price, so the closing was very firm. Moreover, those who teamed up with Tai Chang Zhi Feng Yong sold only 50 taels and six qian. Moreover, the bank bought recent British gold at 7 pence and 6875, which has already increased by more than two shillings. The revealed price was 53 taels. After a while, there was a difference of one or two taels up and down. Because Shunli Wanxing Yuan Cheng Yong Zhi Feng Yong and others were competing to buy, the price gradually rose. Because Zhenggin bought January British gold at 7 pence and 8125, and then 75 was sold by Zhonghang to Maihang at 7 pence and 625, so after 10 o'clock, it rose to 56 taels and three or four qian.</p>
<p>After being high and flat, it fell slightly by one qian and retreated to 5 taels and two or three qian. The banks did each other, and October U.S. dollars were 39 yuan and 625. Shanghai Zhenggin did January British gold at 7 pence and 75. At 10:30, it jumped to 57 taels. Afterwards, Yu Da Yu Fa Yong and retail investors tended to sell, causing the market atmosphere to gradually soften. However, there was a difference of one or two taels. At 11:30, it was estimated to be 53 taels and six or seven qian. Fuchang and others came to buy and were lifted up by more than one tael to 55 taels. Afterwards, sellers continued to sell, and Yu Da continued to sell off. The exchange rate also turned flat. December British gold could be settled at 7 pence and 75, and the gold price was reduced by two taels. At noon, the closing price was 52 taels and nine qian, only one qian lower than the previous day. It had been rising for four consecutive days, and only now has it subsided.</p>
<p>The closing price was 52 taels. The maximum price for half a day was 57 taels, and the minimum price was 50 taels and six qian. The difference was 6 taels and 4 qian. The revealed price was still 605 taels and 4 qian, and the discount was 512 taels. The ledger shows 65 taels for this month, 57 taels for June, 52 taels for November, and 65 taels for water replenishment. The spot red gold has been falling frequently. The current bidding price is only 20 taels or so higher. The goods opened at 2 taels and 2 qian in the early morning and closed at 2 taels and 2 qian at noon.</p>
<p>The entries and exits in the industry are extremely inconsistent. The transaction numbers are Yuan Mao Yong Zhi Feng Yong Yu Da Da Decheng Yuan Da Yong Cheng Feng Yong Yi Feng Yong Chun Yuan Yong Yong Cheng Chang, etc. The changes are sharp and disorderly. Yuan Xing Yong Wan Xing Xie Yu Tai Kang Run, etc. are all entering Yuan Cheng Yong Tong Tai Chang are leaving and entering Jin An Yu Fa Yong Tai Feng Cheng Fu Yu Chang Sheng Yong Yuan Mao, etc. all have sales. There are still different numbers entering and leaving, but there is no large amount. The Dalian gang bought 2,000 bars and sold 1,000 bars to cover Dalian drafts. The Guangdong gang still has no large amount of receipts and payments.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Inner Market is Tight and Elegant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver market continued to decline, but not by much. The market was also firm because the United States still has the wind of rescuing the silver shortage. The exchange rates between the British and the American dollars were small, and the exchange rates in Yokohama and Kobe were unchanged. The rupee rate in India fell slightly. The exchange rates listed by HSBC were the same as those changed in the afternoon of the previous day. However, the inner market seemed tight. It was still flat in the early morning, but then it was upright. At noon, it turned flat. The result was 0.0625 for British gold, 0.1875 for U.S. dollars, and 0.25 for Japanese gold compared to the 26th. It may be that the bidding price of gold has stopped rising. It was soft at first, and then it rose once. At noon, it returned to the flat position. However, the high and low prices also have a difference of more than six taels. Looking back, the final price is not different from the previous day, but people's hearts are restless. Because it was the weekend in the afternoon, the exchange was closed according to the usual practice, and the business transactions were not very prosperous. The entries and exits were inconsistent, but the banks did each other, which was quite different. It is estimated that more than 100,000 pounds of British gold was done with each other. The most active ones were Mai Jiali and Holan. The gold industry only had tens of thousands of pounds of Basa. U.S. dollars were sold by Meifeng to Japanese banks, etc. for 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Japanese gold was still stagnant. Only Korean was dealing with the exit and entry of tens of thousands of yuan of Dalian notes. The market situation was potentially stable.</p>
<p>The British exchange inner market had a difference of 125 for half a day. In the early market, the price for September and October was 1 shilling 7 pence 6875, the buying price was 75. The price for November was 75, the price for December was 8125, and the buying price for January was 9375. The closing price for September and October was 7 pence 625, the price for November was 6875, the price for December was 75, and the buying price for January was 8125, and the buying price was increased by 0.0625.</p>
<p>The U.S. exchange inner market had a difference of 25 for the morning. The price for September and October was 39 yuan 875, the price for November was 40 yuan, the price for December was 40 yuan 0125, and the price for January was 40 yuan 025. The buying price was increased by 125. Zhongxing sold 50,000 yuan to Mai Jiali in January at a price of 40 yuan 0125. Meifeng and Korea did each other for 50,000 yuan this month at a price of 39 yuan 75. They also did 50,000 yuan with Mitsui in October at a price of 625, so the gold price increased to more than 6 taels. Hua Bi and Korea did each other at the same price for 50,000 yuan. At noon, the price for September and October was 39 yuan 625, the price for November was 75, the price for December was 875, and the price for January was 40 yuan. The buying price was 40 yuan 0125. The East exchange inner market had a difference of about half a cent from morning to noon. The Chinese businessmen did not bother with transactions. The initial price for the current period was 1 tael 2 qian 4 fen 50 in October, 4 fen 25 in November, 3 fen 75 in December, and 3 fen 25 in the buying price, which was discounted by a small half cent. Korea entered the current Dalian period for 100,000 yuan in the morning at a price of 4 fen and a half. After 10 o'clock, it sold 100,000 yuan in October at a price of 4 fen and a half. Afterwards, it sold 50,000 yuan this month for 1 tael 2 qian 4 fen 75. At noon, the price for the current period was 1 tael 2 qian 4 fen and a half, which was the same as in the early morning. The prices for the following months were also the same. Speculators were calm.</p>
<h3>The Overseas Silver Market is Weak and Spiritless</h3>
<p>China Sells and the U.S. Maintains</p>
<p>According to the London telegram, China sold out, so large bars of silver continued to shrink, and the market situation was calm. After the market closed, Citibank maintained the market, so it was still firm. The near and far periods were reduced by 125 to 16 pence 75 (equivalent to 1 shilling 7 pence 8125). The American silver price was also reduced by 125 to 3.653125. The British dollar fell by 0.0625 to 4 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen 9375. The American dollar rose by 0.0625 to 4 yuan 8 jiao 6 fen 03125.

The entry and exit price of the British dollar was 2 shillings 034375 to 40625.</p>
<h3>The Weekend Li Discount Market is Peaceful</h3>
<p>Yesterday, it was Saturday, and the banks were closed in the afternoon according to the usual practice. The financial market was calm because of this. The discount price in the market was 7 qian 3 fen 3 li half in the early market and 7 qian 3 fen 3 li 7 hao half in the afternoon market. The result was the same as the previous afternoon. The silver discount was 1 qian in the early market and only 6 fen in the afternoon, which was 45 fen smaller than the previous day. From beginning to end, the white drawing, the bank listed 4 fen, and the market traded. The remittance of tickets was 1.79 million in the early market and 1.225 million in the afternoon market.

<h3>The Bond Market Situation Before Securities Delivery</h3>
<p>The November Period Has Already Opened and Various Prices Have Fallen Slightly</p>
<p>The Securities Exchange Will Be Closed Next Monday for Futures Delivery</p>
<p>The situation of the various public bonds yesterday was that the November period of futures had already opened for trading. The market situation was slightly more prosperous than before. The entry and exit of troop reduction, dismissal, and tariff were not lonely. The situation of after-rehabilitation and the sixth integration had slightly opened. The spot goods only had two types of transactions, dismissal and troop reduction. The other goods had no market. As far as the trends of the various bonds are concerned, although the buying and selling transactions were slightly more prosperous than before, the bond market environment was calm, so although the price continued to fall slightly than the previous day, the trend was always stable, and the front and rear markets fluctuated by only a few cents. The sluggish situation continued to be the same as the previous day. It is estimated that the total spot transaction for the whole day was only 10,000 yuan, and the futures opened out to more than 5.2 million in the morning and 2.7 million in the afternoon, totaling about 8 million. Among them, troop reduction accounted for more than 4.1 million, and dismissal tariff was also good. The other bonds were all very leisurely. Next Monday, because of handling the September futures delivery, the securities exchange will be closed for one day.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Flower Yarn Market in Stable Condition</h3>
<p>The yarn market is firm, but the world cotton industry is trending downwards. However, the local market situation is unusually strong due to several manufacturers purchasing with strong momentum, causing the market to be quite tight. However, most retail investors view the overall situation as unfavorable and are uniformly selling off. The Chaozhou (Teochew) merchant group's attitude remains calm, with most being slightly bearish, but manufacturers have uniquely high confidence. Japanese firms are covering their short positions on Xincheng Hao (a company name), turning from short to long positions, hence the firm market sentiment.</p>
<p>In recent months, yarn prices have risen by one or two person-biao (a unit of measure used in bidding). The pre-market opening saw American cotton grade three trending downwards, and selling pressure was relatively high, with prices falling by five qian. In the second and third rounds, major players vigorously purchased, causing prices to rise by one, two, three, or four qian. In the afternoon, bidding yarn was tight again due to dry conditions on the trading floor. However, grade three yarn fell by two or three yuan, while prices for each month rose by six or seven qian. Total transactions for the day were statistically 19,000 bales. Yiyu sold 1,000 bales, Maoji 1,000 bales, Yichang 1,200 bales, Lichang 1,700 bales, Yongfeng 650 bales, Changfeng 500 bales, and the rest 350 to 450 bales. Xincheng purchased 2,850 bales, Yiyu 2,650 bales, Ruidong 2,000 bales, Meiji 1,050 bales, Yuda 600 bales, and the rest 250 to 350 bales. The closing prices of the person-biao are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Person-Biao Price | Rise/Fall | Balance | Closing Price | Rise/Fall | Balance</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>October | 1540 | Up 1 | 033000 | January | 1537 | Up 6 | 31.800</p>
<p>November | 1540 | 1043100 | February | 1539 | Up 9 | 21850</p>
<p>December | 1537 | Up 9 | 37100</p>
<p>Customer sales to Guangdong (Cantonese) are relatively healthy, and yarn sales are still good. Statistically, the various merchant groups purchased a total of 2,025 bales for the day, with fellow merchants taking in 230 bales. The market is firm and rising. Among the customer groups, Guangdong took in 1,240 bales, Hankou 180 bales, Sichuan 320 bales, Tianjin 105 bales, and miscellaneous groups 120 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Shows Promising Signs in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The cotton market was flat in the morning but firm in the afternoon. However, the American cotton market is showing a clear downward trend. Yet, the local cotton situation is still firm because the farmers in various regions are unwilling to release their cotton. A large number of domestic merchants are buying up cotton, believing that the local harvest will be poor. The amount of cotton being taken in remains consistently high, hence the tight market. However, due to political unrest in India, yarn factories have stopped work, causing a surplus of raw materials, which are being aggressively sold abroad at reduced prices. As a result, various factories are buying large amounts of Indian cotton, completely encroaching on the position of Chinese cotton.</p>
<p>The Han-biao (cotton bidding market) was boosted by the person-biao. The pre-market opening of the Han-biao saw heavy selling pressure due to poor performance of American and Indian cotton, with prices falling by two qian. Later, a portion of the market was bought up, causing it to firm up. As a result, prices fell by only five fen to one qian. In the afternoon, due to good yarn performance, the cotton market was boosted, and prices for each month rose by five fen to one qian. Total transactions for the day were statistically 30,400 dan (a unit of weight). Xincheng sold 1,800 dan, Shengtail 1,000 dan, Tianchang 1,900 dan, Lichang 2,800 dan, Yongfeng 1,500 dan, and the rest 900 to 1,100 dan. Yuchang purchased 1,600 dan, Yuande 1,800 dan, Shenyu 1,800 dan, Yuda 1,400 dan, Rongxing 1,300 dan, and others 900 to 1,000 dan. The closing prices of the Han-biao are recorded on the left.</p>

<h3>Overseas Flower and Yarn Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>American cotton is heavily shorted. Yesterday, due to heavy short selling, Wall Street was fatigued, and long positions were closed, causing the market to soften significantly. Futures fell by 11 to 19 points, and spot prices fell by 20 points. British cotton futures fell by 8 to 9 points, and spot prices fell by 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 10 points.

<h3>Heavy Short Selling of Southern American Cotton Last Week</h3>
<p>Market Prices Frequently Declined</p>
<p>A New York telegram on the 26th reported on the cotton market for the week, stating that the cotton market fell due to increased short selling in the South and renewed closing of long positions in the near term. As of yesterday, the amount of deliverable cotton reached 32,000 bales. Traders continued to buy when prices fell, but their strength could not withstand the short selling. According to official sources, the Cotton Maintenance Association has accumulated a total of 1.3 million bales of cotton. Unless the value reaches or exceeds the cost, it will not be released this season. The Federal Trust Bank announced that it will provide loans to help cotton farmers hoard their raw cotton to wait for market stability. The weekend statistics are listed on the left (unit: thousand bales).</p>

<h3>The Downtrend in Grain and Rice Markets Slightly Subsides</h3>
<p>Prices Rise Slightly by Two or Three Jiao (Dimes)</p>
<p>More than 30 boats arrived in Zhabei yesterday, and sales have gradually become active. Because various stores' appetites have turned stable due to production information and rice merchants have suffered too many losses, they are adding to their purchases. However, the amount taken in is not large, preventing the market price from falling further. Therefore, although the buying interest in the market is active, the price is still subject to some reduction, but the overall trend has felt stable. The top grade of Western New Japonica rice has weakened by half a jiao, opening at 16 yuan and 1.2 jiao. Ordinary grades are down by two or three jiao, with large orders at only 15 yuan and 3.4 jiao. Eastern New Japonica rice is also down slightly by two jiao, with the special top grade at 14 yuan and 7 jiao. Pudong market is high at 14 yuan and 3 jiao, with few transactions. Yangjian opens at 12 yuan and 5 jiao, Dujian at 12 yuan and 8 jiao or more, all continuing to fall slightly by two or three jiao. The top grade cargo of Kejian sees hundreds of stones, with prices opening at 11 yuan and 5 jiao, but the market is still only at 10 yuan and 8 jiao. Bujian is doing high at 12 yuan, with no rise or fall in the market. From the closing situation, it seems to be trending towards stability. Baiyuan (white rice) is also calm, opening at 17 yuan and 5.6 jiao.</p>
<p>More than 40 boats arrived at South Shanghai River, but the appetite of stores in this street is not developing. Fortunately, the situation in the North Shanghai market has turned flat, and various stalls have been able to stabilize slightly. Broken Japonica rice is still sparsely arriving, opening at 20 yuan. New Japonica high-grade cargo is suddenly scarce, with all transactions concentrated in the range of 13 yuan and 7.8 jiao, down by about two jiao. Southern Xiang Japonica rice is seeing high at 14 yuan. This cargo once reached a peak of 20 yuan and a half during its peak, which has fallen by more than 6 yuan and 5 jiao compared to the current market price. Jiaobaijian opens at 12 yuan and 8 jiao, Dujian at 12 yuan, Yangjian at 11 yuan and 8.7 jiao or more, all of which are high-grade cargo, and the market has fallen by about half to three jiao.</p>
<h3>Recent Flour Market Remains Attractive</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday, both near-term and far-term months remained in a revolving situation. Only spot flour from the North is still being cleared by retail stores, and a major factory is also selling its own cargo from the North. Therefore, the market this month has also been boosted. Furthermore, most factories have reduced production, and a factory has also left tracks of shorting, causing the spot for the month to rise steadily. The closing price was as high as 2 yuan, 4 jiao, 7 fen, and 2.5 li, which is significantly higher by 1 fen and 2.5 li compared to the previous day's closing price. The price of October also rose by 5 li. The price of the forward date was also initially good, then returned to its decline as the factory sold the short, and the final price of November, Positive November, and February was the same as the closing price the previous day, and that of December was down by 2.5 li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Continue to Fall by Two Fen</h3>
<p>This Month's Deliveries Were Clear, With Only Huafeng Taking in Four Cars</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market yesterday, it continued the weakening trend of the previous day, and prices for all months fell by 3.4 fen. Then, because the flour market reported a rise, sentiment turned positive, and prices for all months rose by 2.3 fen. However, the actual sales of spot wheat were still very sluggish, and there were large shipments of foreign wheat, and there was no real sales activity of flour and wheat, so it was difficult for the market price to stand. As a result, the prices of October fell by 2 fen, those of November by 2 fen, those of December by 1 fen, that of January was unchanged, and that of February fell by 1 fen. The current month's deliveries have been completely delivered, and there are many reports of verification and release of goods. Due to the lack of receiving households, only Huafeng Factory took in four cars, and the rest were settled at a price to offset the price. The spot wheat market is still sluggish. Yesterday, the transaction price for a car of high-grade wheat was 4 yuan and 7 jiao, and the price for 2,000 bags of Shashi wheat was 4 yuan, 1 jiao, 4 fen, and 5 li, and the price of Shashi wheat was slightly higher by 1 qian, 3 fen, and 4 li compared to the previous opening price.</p>
<h3>Foreign Wheat Fell by Two or Three Jiao According to Yesterday's Telegram</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Tongxun Agency's 8:45 telegram reported that Chicago's September wheat futures were 7 yuan, 6 jiao, and 6.25 fen, the same as the previous day; the December contract was 8 yuan and 3.75 fen, down 2 jiao and 6.25 fen from the previous day; the March contract was 8 yuan, 6 jiao, and 7.5 fen, down 3 jiao and 5 li. Also, Canadian wheat futures for September were 7 yuan, 2 jiao, and 1.25 fen, also down 2 jiao and 3.75 li from the previous day; December was 7 yuan, 4 jiao, and 6.25 fen, down 2 jiao and 6.25 fen; and March was 8 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2.5 fen, down 2 jiao and a half.</p>
<h3>Yellow Beans Fell, Sesame Seeds Remained Weak</h3>
<p>After the price of yesterday's standard Liaodou (soybeans from Liaoning) dropped sharply by 1 qian from the previous day, customer appetites became slightly active. In the afternoon, after receiving a telegram from the Lian Electric Company reporting flatness, the situation became more stable. Therefore, the December contract still opened at 4 yuan, 9 qian, and 3 fen, and the January contract at 4 yuan and 9 qian. The market has a sign of a short-term recovery. The source of spot beans from the Yangtze River has gradually arrived from various locations. Initially, due to the standard being extremely small, people were watching. Then, due to the sale by cargo customers, the market became stable. As a result, there was not much rise or fall in the market price from the previous day. It is estimated that 1,200 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan, 200 bags of Jiujiang Chidou (late beans), 150 bags of Jiang Qiaozi, and 350 bags of Hankou Zaohuang (early yellow beans) were sold.</p>
<p>The sesame seed market has remained flat in recent days. Because the harvest in the inland has been abundant, shipments to Shanghai have been very frequent, and the accumulation in the city has gradually increased. Foreign firms have little business, except for slight movement in Europe and the United States, and Japan is even wanting to reduce sales, leading to few transactions. Prices have remained relatively stable. Shashi, Hankou, and other white sesame seeds are still around 8 yuan and 3 jiao and a half. Jiujiang milk sesame, Yuan sesame, and Xue sesame are only between 7 yuan and 7 jiao and 7 yuan and 4 jiao. A total of 950 bags were sold for the day.</p>
<h3>Reduced Arrivals of Customer Xian Rice, Temporarily Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of customer Xian rice was scarce. The appetite of both local and country merchants has been good, and the market has been temporarily stable. However, the number of Du rice entering the market is increasing, and Xian rice from all locations has been launched onto the market. Xian rice from various ports above Nanjing is waiting to be loaded down south, and the harvest in Jiangxi, Anhui, and Hunan provinces has been good. Although it has not seen very robust arrivals now, arrivals from Shen (Shanghai) are eventually expected in the future. Furthermore, there are also confirmed orders for foreign rice arriving in port, and people are still bearish as a result. Although the arrival of customer Xian rice was scarce and sales were active yesterday, the market price remained stable, but there is still no good outlook for the future market. 1,000 bags of Jiangxi machine early (rice) were sold, priced at 11 yuan, 2 jiao, and 4 fen to 10 yuan and 6 jiao, 100 bags of early brown rice were priced at 8 yuan per jiao, and 300 bags of Wuhu machine rice were priced at 10 yuan, 6 jiao, and a half to 10 yuan and 1 jiao.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Cotton Lake Red Sugar Still Thinly Inventoried, Market Still Attractive</h3>
<p>Price Setting and Transactions Quiet, Market Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's place of origin (Cuba) telegraphed that the current price of Cuban sugar was 1.09375, which had fallen 3125. The price of New York's December sugar futures was 1.06, down 5 points; the price of next year's March sugar futures was 1.16, and the price of May's was 1.23, each also down 6 points. The Association's market had a setting price on Dutch sugar #24 coarse granulated white, but purchasing interest was still scarce, and transactions were even quieter because it was Saturday. New cargo was transacted slightly at 8 yuan and 5 fen. Chen cargo (old cargo) was rare at 7 yuan and 7 qian, and the demand for Shouzhong (hand selected) granulated white was also quiet at 7 yuan and 9 qian. Nissho N mark was 8 yuan and 1 qian, J mark was 8 yuan, 2 qian, and 2.5 fen, Minghua YT mark was 7 yuan and 9 qian, YRO mark was 7 yuan, 8 qian, and 2.5 fen, and TM mark was 7 yuan, 7 qian, and 2.5 fen. Imports and exports were also sparse, and the market shape still felt weak. Haopan (listing of sellers) had domestic unified hand rock sugar listed for dozens of boxes, priced at 1 yuan and 6 liang, and the market saw flatness and weakness. Cotton Lake red sugar continued to be listed for 40 bags, priced at 1 yuan and 8 liang and 5 qian. Because the market inventory was particularly thin, the market was still attractive.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods Hainan Dried Longan (Guiyuanrou) Haopan (Listing of Sellers) Fell Again</h3>
<p>Since the new Guiyuanrou product came out this year, the price has frequently declined because the go-around market has been flat. Hainan Yuanrou has been the most numerous for cargo out, so the price fall has also been the greatest. The previous listing was as low as 26 liang, then it rose to 27.8 liang. Because the arriving source was prosperous again, this unusual trend was rekindled. It was previously heard that 400+ pieces were listed, with higher-grade goods priced at 26 liang and 2 qian, and ordinary goods priced at 25 liang and 7 qian, all of which require losses to costs. Shengshai (sun-dried) Yuanrou also fell one or two liang up and down, but Shijie (stone boundary) Shengshai Yuanrou has a small number of arrivals, so the price is still stable.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Factory Silk European Sales are Unmoving</h3>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Firm's Silk Sales Still Have No Life. Inspecting European and American Silk Weaving Factories, to Reduce Expenses For Raw Materials, Outside Of Artifical Silk and Low-Priced Japanese Silk, Italian Silk and Two Countries Silk were deemed too expensive, with no purchasing power. European Sales of Silk Factory is Completely Stopped. Yesterday, Boxingsheng entered Hehua brand top #28-30 sliver head, Pot Wash Yellow Silk Reeling with 8 packages priced at 651 liang, and Gaobei entered Earth Brand Top #2 Washing with polluted yellow coarse silk with 10 packages priced at 285 liang.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Future Rises, Current is Flat</h3>
<p>Artificial silk sales have been booming recently. Many domestic manufacturers need large number of artificial silk. Transactions are very frequent. 150 count goods from Germany, France, Italy are sold specially well. According to information from foreign bank, artificial silk company fixed price are hard, and stock price has been reduced more than 20% compared to last month. Based on current prices, the cost of artificial fiber is much more expensive than the last month. However, the artificial silk sales is must be booked early to prepare for silk spinning early next spring, but vendors insist on delivery in future, but will accommodate prices for spot goods. This has caused the market to rise. Prices for each hundred pound has risen between two liang to five/six liang. Manufacturers only trade in Futures, because Autumn silk already spun, artificial silk will not be mixed for winter goods production. Spot trades are slow, and Futures trades are active, and Futures trades are popular, with the largest amount traded around December to prepare silk cloth for weaving of silk "hua si ge", crepe, zhongshan crepe and early spring silk cloths.</p>
<h3>Lakes and Rivers Region Autumn Cocoon, 3000 packages, Transported to Shanghai via waterway</h3>
<p>The lakes region, Wu Xing, Changxing, Deqing and other counties have kept their Autumn Silkworm capacity, however there was damage due to the weather being unfavorable. Production is expected to be only 30-40%. Silk merchant shops that are open are only 40%. Not enough production for the Shanghai factories, so factories are now requesting waterways and small boats. Estimated amount 3000 packages or so to be transported to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>China Tea Russian Sales Will Be Revived</h3>
<p>Notice of starting a Tea program next week</p>
<p>Since Russian stores and Association have stopped business, Shanghai Tea market has been desolate. From reliable source, Russian traders who had been working in Hankou are now free to the Shanghai bank Association for Gongxi Green tea and Ningzhou Red Tea. It's been decided to start business next week, with plans announced for Zhenmei Green Tea and Morocco sales still sluggish. Market is still not doing well.</p>
