<h3 id="c16">匃牙利復辟重提 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>匈牙利復辟之謡。不得已發生若干次矣。雖其政府時加否認。然而赫伯斯堡王室之陰謀活動。則爲彰彰不可掩之事實。且其蓄有復辟之决心已久雖屢遇挫折而不悔也。惟其問題而果實現者則其關係實大。而非僅匃牙利一國之問題矣。蓋匃牙利在戰後。雖與奥國同受特里亞農條約之限制。似已無能力以侵略人國。然而其周圍各小國。如捷克羅馬尼亞南斯拉夫等。旣因人種之不同對匃時生猜忌。復懼其勢力之侵大。而常欲加以遏止。故對於匈牙利政府一舉一動至今仍極注意。前此小協約之成立。本含有防禦匈牙利活動之意。且相約如赫伯斯堡王室復活。則雖與匈開戰而不恤。故加爾二次圖謀復辟。各小協約國均以極嚴厲手段對付。卒將加爾廢位。並禁錮荒島而止。近頃復辟運動復起後。羅馬尼亞首相與捷克社會黨。均已有反對表示。見於報紙。則今日復辟之説而果實現者。能不引起邦交上之大糾紛乎。吾故謂此問題實關中歐大局。而非。僅僅匈牙利一國之問題也</p>

<p>上半時二比零下半時一比零施高塔杯初賽</p>
<p>眞茹足球隊昨在施高塔杯初賽中、以三比零兩敗樂華隊於逸園足球場、觀者約四五千人、樂華李惠堂調任中堅、表演極佳、裡應外合、無不得心應手、惟守門員瞿鴻德稍見疏失、前鋒陣線、於昨報所載者、略有出入、蓋以楊人偉楊星岩等未能到場臨時請人替代、仍未見鞏固、陸鍾恩之中鋒、實欠軟弱、眞茹依然奮鬥上半時勝兩、球下半時機會雖多、僅獲一球、兩隊陣線如下、</p>
<h3 id="c95">眞茹 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>

<h3 id="c97">樂華逞威 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>下令動員、樂華先攻開始、在眞茹區内盤旋多時、高大韓傳球中央、在眞茹門前落下、扎掙多時、李惠堂舉脚射門、梁守門救出、眞茹前、乃引兵進攻、半途折回樂華再度襲進、陸鍾恩打門未中、</p>
<h3 id="c98">眞茹告捷 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>眞茹患難旣去、乃興兵入寇、聲勢兇兇、樂華門前、屢逞不安、瞿守門兩次退敵、眞茹不甘示弱、鍾連基見左邊高球飛來、向前迎接、同時瞿守門亦跑出搶奪、各無所得、戴麟經在二十碼處得球、對門遠踼、斯時瞿鴻德跑出未及趕追、李寗見勢不佳、即退守門中、不料一球飛來、李不敢用手、脚踼未着、球遂應聲入網、眞茹乃首開紀錄、離開賽不到二十分鐘、</p>
<h3 id="c99">相持不下 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>樂華陣線、内部尙稱堅固前鋒　　散亂、林炳文兩次傳中、均頗得法但中路缺乏應援、頻失良機、有一次爲陸鍾恩以手觸球而失、至於眞茹方面、軍容極振、聯絡美洲、秉祥匹馬沿邊進兵、直逹無人之境、大有前飲黃龍之概李寗見勢不佳火速趕上、從橫裡殺到臥地阻攔、秉祥卒無可奈何、入後秉祥一次傳中、連基迎面衝上威風凛凛、但脚頭太高未能命中、</p>
<h3 id="c100">眞茹再勝 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>斯時雙方門前、互有險境約四十分鐘許、眞茹戴中鋒在樂華門前十二碼處得球、盤左盤右幸被打開去路、對門力射、球由右角穿進、瞿守門手擋未能搭牢、眞茹乃勝二球、戰不滿三分鐘、上半時於焉告終、</p>
<h3 id="c101">再戰聲起 <a href="#c101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>樂華聲勢忽盛、球在眞茹區内盤旋者多時、曾連獲兩次角球、惜無建樹、久而久之、樂華又陷危境、陳家球代踼角球、挑選極佳、沿門柱掠左、俱未截住　之陳鎭和在樂華門前三十碼處踼任意球、對　　射、瞿守門擊而失手、幸觸門柱未進、眞茹童榮文、適候在門邊、正擬轉身打門、但以越位被罰樂華不負此球、可謂僥倖</p>
<h3 id="c102">連中三元 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>未畿、眞茹五前鋒如生龍活虎、互相呼應極盡聯絡之能事直取樂門、一路無阻因中路三將、短兵相接、樂華守門瞿君、勢成孤單、援助乏人、冒險向前阻攔、童榮文乘機一脚、鵠的命中、而成三與零之比、</p>
<h3 id="c103">樂華死守 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>此後樂華已成强弩之末、眞茹氣焰不衰、戴中鋒從中接濟、陳秉祥得其援助、向邊種進、比逹樂華門前、瞿守門向有爭奪、直趨左角地位、門中頓現空虚、瞿守門幾忘自已職位、一時盍座轟然、傳爲笑柄、此後戴麟經兩次射門、瞿守門均接而復失、幸無入衝上否則殆矣、比賽終了、眞茹以三比零勝、樂華遂致淘汰、</p>

<h3 id="c116">論出口商家宜自動組織中國輸出貿易恊會　壽景偉 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>近年以來、談吾國經濟問題者、莫不注意於輸出貿易之發展、在現今商戰潮流彌漫全球情形之下、各國無不極力提倡本國之出口貿易、以取得貿易平衡之順差、如戰後關税制度之趨向保護、人口税率之普遍提高、國貨運動之盡务提倡出口貿易之極端奬勵、均爲近年來所發生之普遍現象吾國處此種潮流之下尤其在金貴銀賤時期中、欲謀國民經濟之救濟洵非自鼓勵輸出貿易上着手不爲功、唯自海通以還吾國數十年來之出口貿易實有不容吾人樂觀者在長時期之入超、洋商勢力之膨漲、買辦制度之壓迫、出口商家資本之缺乏及組織之不健全、無不顯著吾國國際貿易上之病態自入超方面言自有海關册六十六年以來、所有出超不過六年、而入超則有六十年之長久、出超合計不過二千七百餘萬兩、（海關兩）而入超合計則逹四十七萬萬餘兩兩者相較相差四十六萬兩之鉅出超不過占入超十分方弱、此項長時期鉅數目之入超、即吾國無從抵補之漏巵亦即國民經濟不健全狀態之一端也自重要出口商品之消長上言、則吾國素負盛名之絲茶蛋産品等項、無一非逐年衰落而衰落之程度乃有出吾人意外者、生絲擁天然之便利、攸遠之歷史、近年來雖數量及價値上略有增加、而與全國貿易之百分比則由百分之三十二（一八六九）减至百分之十四（一九二八）至與全世界生絲消費比較其百分數之下落、更不可以道里計矣、而年來日本絲業之發展競爭、尤足與華商以極大之壓迫、美國絲銷早爲日絲所充斥、最近絲銷停頓絲價慘落、即素以樂銷華絲著名之里昻絲市、亦或將拱手讓人絲業前途、不堪設想華茶貿易更可悲觀前淸同光年間華茶行銷幾遍全球、光緖初年毎年輸出二百餘萬担光緖十五年以後、即逐漸下落、民國初年尙有一百四五十担民國七年驟落至四十萬擔九年更落至三十萬担至於與全國貿易之百分比、則由百分之五十五（一八七○）落至百分之四弱（一九二八）而年來以印錫茶葉之競爭俄銷停滯幾無日不在掙扎呼籲中下落之程度、旣可　人、而前途情形尤屬岌岌可危、蛋産品毎年出口居吾國出口貿易中之第三四位與絲茶並稱、歐美及日本銷塲原屬甚大近年來旣受各國提倡蛋類增加本産之影響、復受提高關税限制入口之壓迫、亦與日俱减、了無生氣、他如主要出口商品如　油生仁火腿等項、非各國自謀種植减少入口、即藉口多端、設法限制亦無不在日趨衰落之情形之下此就吾國一部份重要出口商品上實際情形觀察可知吾國出口貿易衰敗之象徵實無可諱言者也自金銀輸出入情形言則歷年來亦以入超爲最多、十七年銀貨入超凈額爲一萬○六百萬兩十八年、爲八千八百萬兩、一方面貿易入超、同時金銀輸出入亦爲入超此爲吾國特種現象、亦國民經濟不健全所表現之一端也、故自各方面觀察、吾國出口貿易之極應提倡實不容或緩者也」、提倡國際貿易之方法、論者多所論列歸納之不外政府方面之提倡及商人自動之改進二端、關於政府方面者約有數點</p>
<p>一、國際貿易局之設立國際貿易局爲政府補助貿易發展之主要機關、一方面調查國外市塲情形搜集貿易統計資料一方面對於出口商家作專門的建議及有力之援助同時對於交易上糾紛金融上之活動、均有調解提携之義務英國之海外貿易局（創始於一九一七年、爲報告海外工商情形之中樞機關）市場開拓局、（創始於一九二一年爲輸出貿易之助長機關除總局外、並設有地方事務所、協同事務所海外商務官）、法國之貿易局、（創立於一九○六年）專任調查商情）均屬此種制度、此種機關之特點、第一可以調查國外市塲情形以供本國商人之參考、第二可以轉助商人解决貿易上之種種問題、第三派遣各地商務官及通信員、</p>
<p>二、輸出信用保險制度輸出信用保險制度、爲促進貿易之金融上一種設施英國之一九二○年之海外貿易法、及一九二六年之新輸出信用保險制度、即由政府及保證局保谕證輸出商發行之買主付欵匯票之支付信用、給以保證及金融上之便利、法國輸出貿易之主要設施亦爲輸出信用保險制度、於一九二八年七月實施其目的亦在於助長本國之輸出商人、德國對俄輸出、亦採此種信用保證制度、</p>
<p>三輸出奬勵金制度此爲各國施行最普遍之一種、對於某種輸出品至一定重量時、與以一定之資金或用退税之辦法以優待本國商人、如英國之絲退税汽車退税等、是也、</p>
<p>四保護税制度輸出獎勵金爲供給國内商人以驅逐勁敵之工具、自國内商人奬勵着手、而保護税、則爲直接排斥競爭者之方法、</p>
<p>五各種輔助貿易機關之提倡如銀行保險運輸等事業、均爲輔助出口貿易必要之設施、</p>
<p>六、各種鼓勵貿易之組織如商品陳列館展覧會等均屬之、</p>
<p>關於商家自動改進者、亦有數禍</p>
<p>㈠出口商組織之健全</p>
<p>㈡出口商資本之充裕</p>
<p>㈢出口商品質上之改良</p>
<p>以上爲公私方面發展貿易之方策、各國已行之有效、惟吾人以爲根本之圖、尤在於出口商人之聯合組織、而此種聯合組織、即所謂一種輸出貿易協會是也、輸出貿易協會、不僅促成出口商人之健全組織、充足資本、改良品質、即對於海外市塲之調查出口貿易之指導、亦無不網羅在内、其組織之要端、可分别言之如左、</p>
<p>㈠輸出貿易協會宜以出口商爲組織主體也吾國輸出貿易失敗最大之原因、即爲缺乏聯絡之組織、無論何種事務、均各自爲政、甚且互相排斥、對内則旣不能免除同業之競爭、對外更無共禦外侮之圑結、以致上人侵略勢力、尙未臨境、本國商人、即早已無力支持此種情形、因不獨出口商家爲然、而於出口事業尢爲重要、欲求出口商品之有在海外市塲上占一地位、非本國出口商家有一共同堅固圑結之組織不可、此出口貿易協會之組成、須以出口商家爲主體也、</p>
<p>㈡輸出貿易協會宜以促進直接貿易爲最大目標也談吾國出口貿易者、無不知吾國貿易權之旁落、完全操於外人手中、所謂國際貿易者、乃一種洋行貿易、或爲對買辦貿易、凡國内土貨出洋、向例由洋行包辦、華商以貨交入洋行、即視爲已盡出口貿易之能事、甚且只須貨件收到、出口與否、即任洋行處置、從不過問、以致貿易完全爲洋行所操縱、國外市塲情形、賣主不得而知、除隨時向洋行探聽收買消息及交易訂貨外、了無他法、絲茶等項、即受此種操縱之最烈者、此種情形、雖洋商有種種特權足以限制華商、然華商亦不能辭因循苟且之咎數年前、頗有商家數人、自立小機關、直接送貨至美銷售者、惜組織太小、收效甚微、吾國有識商家、非不知此種貿易之爲害甚大、實以資本人才、均感缺乏、而組織不固、尤不能脫離與洋行交易範圍也、故輸出貿易協會之成立、宜以促進直接貿易爲最要目標、以出口商家共同之組織、資本魄力、兩臻雄厚、而專門人才亦能羅致、旣可免除洋商抑勒壓迫之損失、復可堅固外人之信仰心、對於直接貿易之成功、絶非難事、在現今各國極力避免被動貿易與間接貿易中、而吾國貿易乃被動又被動間接又間接、吾人其不有以自警惕耶、</p>
<p>㈢輸出貿易協會宜注重於海外市塲之調查也歐西各國、對於輸出貿易之發展、其主要前題、即爲海外市塲之調查蓋海外市塲需求情形與商品出口有密切關係故輸出貿易協會之主要職務、須就海外經濟狀况市場情形以及特别之貿易問題、予以澈底之調查將調查所得彙集統計隨時刋布以作出口商家及國内工商界之參考其應進行者一調查一般經濟狀况一報告市塲交易及需求情形三彙集主要市塲之生産輸出入收獲、商品價格等項統計四報告關於税新航線鐵路運輸率電報郵政等等變更情形、五彙集外國政府所發表之各種報告年表貿易雜誌等項</p>
<p>㈣輸出貿易協會宜以改良品質杜絶弊端爲職責也品質不良爲國際貿易失敗之最要原因、吾國輸出商品品質方面之最爲人指摘者即爲品質之龐雜及等級之不分例如絲茶、牌號不下數十百種而毎種牌號之規定均不能代表一定之品質、有同一種絲而兩年牌號互異者此種情形爲商品對外出口之最大妨碍他如墨守陳法不知改良尤爲品質上之缺點此外尙有攙雜作僞之弊如棉花之攙水攙雜凡此弊端輸出貿易協會、以處於同等利害之關係極宜設法改良剷除積弊方能保持國際間商品之信用也、</p>
<p>㈤輸出貿易協會家兼注意於貿易經營方法及輸出技術之研究也貿易之發展與否系於貿易經營方法及輸出技術之良否者甚大吾國對於此種經營方法及技術毫不注意而此又爲對外貿易之要圖如出口商品之精密研究報關出口之手續、對外航運之情形對外保險之辦法出口貨之檢查手續海外市塲之特别習慣海外銷售方法之研究海外金融機關之聯絡與匯欵辦法等均所謂輸出技術者是也此種技術非有專門人才之精密研究不爲功其研究所得之效果亦非僅限於一出口商故此種進行亦爲輸出貿易協會所必需注意者也</p>
<p>總之輸出貿易協會之組織在歐美各國、早已收效甚巨在吾國此種貿易情形之下、實爲不可或緩之圖非特可以促進直接貿易之成功且可防禦國外之屯併手段、ＤumpnigPolicy如最近日本生絲售價减低奪取美法市場即屯併政策之表現設吾國出口商家有强固健全之組織可以直接向外推銷則以吾國天然人工之優美、何患無法與之抗衡此不侫所由深望我國出口商家能互相聯合而積極向外發展也、</p>

<p>— 顔也</p>
<p>有人自杭州來者言該地最近發生三奇事奇物足資譚助爰急誌之以付本談。</p>
<p>天目山畔有鄉民孫某。於某日傍晚閒眺溪畔。瞥見一龜由水登陸。其首與鷹相若異之急捕之至家於燈光下細視。則其口銳而下曲雙目炯炯。絶似鷹首。甲黑若漆光可鑑人。其他足也尾也背紋也則與常龜無異孫某視爲至寳。愛護周至翌晨黎明時室中忽有啼聲。初駭此聲之何由繼出窺之覺聲出龜所。潛往聽之乃龜長鳴也益爲驚異。風聲所播遠的咸來觀賞。杭垣某古玩店主人近以重價易之歸視若古玩杭。人之往索觀者門庭若市。莫不嘆爲世間奇物也。余前月撰龜異篇刋諸本談所述均稀世之龜今得此龜覺前所言者。又不足爲異矣。</p>
<p>杭垣在兩月前有一六十四歲之老媼。嫁與年約四旬之楊某。一時社會資爲笑談。近又有六旬老婦生子之奇聞婦居距杭不遠之某鎭。夫已古稀之年。家富有。惟門衰祚薄僅兩老相依爲命蓋彼夫婦同居四十年初無一次之弄璋與弄瓦也故兩老之所慮者。亦惟此伯道無兒。詎料事有大奇者去歲之冬婦忽孕。今春腹漸隆起兩老均疑爲疾。歷訪諸醫則皆曰此孕也可喜也。兩老則將信將疑。亦驚亦喜。自夏之秋腹已若五石瓢。日前果臨盆。一聲驚啼。視之雄也。枯楊生梯。一脈以傳血食。老婦樂而不知産後之痛楚。老夫更老興勃發笑口常開。三朝之日。即大會賓客。舉湯餅之筵親朋族黨莫不詫爲奇事皆大歡喜。而所不樂者。即預定承嗣兩老之族中某甲也。</p>

<p>市集之制自古相沿。現尙盛行於歐陸。納丁漢城之鵝市及其他各地之帚市皮市縱多著名。然尙不及德國福蘭克佛脫城所舉行之蟲市。爲更熱閙而富奇趣斯市年有定期。屆時世界各地有蟲癖者。莫不遠道而來。選購佳種。所出代價。即高逾尋常亦所不惜。市内陳列之品舉凡蝴蝶·飛蛾甲蟲·蠅類·蚱蜢·蟋蟀·以及其他草蟲應有盡有。分門别類。藉供顧客之採擇。然亦有若干兜售之徒並無樣品在塲而用定期交貨辦法。其售蟲專藉口頭接洽。祗須主顧説明其種類即可預定成交一如美國游行販畜者貨物之運來乃在數千里外也。此種人大都對於奇蟲名稱。何處可以搜捕。熟如指掌。苟遇需求即市會之期。斯蟲尙未出世。彼亦可向買客立一保單。按期交付。蟲類之貿易。竟如此之盛。斯亦好新奇者所不可不知也。</p>

<p>— 王梅璩</p>
<p>星期三（十月二十九日）午後陰雲如磐。密雨震瓦。枯坐西樓。方苦吟得斷名云「人間刦運更陽九。天上猶吹落帽風」忽聞鈴語傳來。許厪父先生招赴淸風明月廬作持螯小飲之樂。即冒風雨驅車而往。酒冽蟹肥。絮語皆雋誌之如左。</p>
<p>無獨有偶　厪父倒屣。入室笑語。不佞屈指計厪父伉儷生朝伊邇。將謀一醉夫人曰。生朝飲啖殊爲無謂。因指其如嫂夫人與其寄女。謂此二人者皆不自知其生之月日。蓋如夫人幼遭匪掠。而其寄女則失哺哀雛。父爲名士。惟知悼亡。不復記愛女何日生。不佞曰。眞無獨而有偶矣</p>
<p>快人快語　蟹旣登盤。或尖或圑。各擇所嗜。有先食蟹斗而後持螯者。有細拈八跪。以蟹斗爲後勁者。申公石伽搜剔細緻。如夫人笑之曰。若是其瑣瑣也曷若生呑活剝之爲快。衆皆軒渠。視如夫人樽前。八跪雙螯。皆連壳帶肉大嚼狂吐。不减舞陽侯生啖　肩風度。如此快人。安得不有此快語。</p>
<p>壇玷風高　鍾子吉宇後至。拾殘蟹。棄蟹斗。獨啖　跪。蓋羊棗有僻嗜也。余曰如此風雨。何處游遨。乃至蹈防風覆轍。吉宇且啖且告曰。　君言。固將爲君告。吾師厪父子年宦兩粤執敎鞭。返滬後海内外企慕盛名爭列門牆。後徇衆意登報廣招。數逹三千君所知也。近年厓岸稍高。不復延納而私淑者。以爲觖望。余與馮若梅陳建子何止靑諸人。尤感時雨之化憐宮牆之外望。請壇玷之復張。今日正與諸同門共立章程議組織法。非防風氏之比也。余按厪父門下衆多。此數子者。固已升堂入室。蜚聲藝苑。近日女弟子中如乇髮華𩭨雲姊。妹不佞均奉爲畏友亦可見壇玷風高矣。</p>
<p>興復不淺　酒闌人醉。兩夫人以薑汁和冰雪糖餉客。厪父憑夫人肩喁喁私語。夫人頻摇其首。含笑而無言。余適見之厪父曰。君勿笑。愚夫婦人已中年。固不妨對客調情。余曰。老子興復不淺。不畏無腸公子祟耶。夫人方欲答辯吉宇忽自後房來向余言。吾師招生新定章程。煩爲徧逹遐邇凡附郵票一分。即可索詳章於淸風明月廬。言已即出。並未聞余等雅謔。誠服之心。有若此者。</p>

<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>前晚風雨交作。予悶懷無可自遣。橫臥榻上。聊以憩息忽有大漢二人不速登樓。逕入余定呼荊人走。予大訝詫。大漢旣見予。亦屬聲呼余下。予莫解其故。立叱斥之。旣而又有數人拾級而上。攘袂助虐予始知爲匪。且雞肋不足以當老拳。祇能帖服就範。聽其揮令。旋驅予夫婦至樓下廂房中。時同居男女均已被迫列坐。匪徒立門口。執手槍相對命吾儕男子面壁。不許觀視。餘匪再登樓倒篋翻箱。肄意剽刦荊人膽怯見手槍。戰慄縮仆於榻。匪徒誤以爲有所珍藏。再三搜索得雙毫銀幣二。手上金約指一枚并取攫之絶有趣者。匪徒向同居婦勒索金銀細軟同居婦未解其語。加之惶急失措。即取桁上所懸之西裝領帶與匪徒匪徒怒　之。傭婦御一金絲環匪徒取之去傭婦哀求。向之叩頭無算。匪徒竟惻焉心動而奉還之强盜發善心。洵屬難得旣而匪徒呼嘯遠颺。同居固各有損失。予略加檢點。除零星飾物銀幣外失一大皮篋均爲荊人之衣服。蓋日前鄰近失愼。荊人特將較爲完美之飾物。併置大皮篋中。以防不測而便取携也。茲爲匪徒所掠有。則豈始料所及哉。其他破書殘稿爲予之至寳。反未埀匪徒之靑睞。而原封不動則予之喜慰可知夫予以文丐資格。而得蒙匪徒貴趾之光降。是亦足以自豪矣。一笑。</p>

<p>左詩晨道。那末你也淌眼淚了。翠筠道我是不。説誑話小手巾濕透了三。塊第一。我給蓮香是要好的小姊妹。伊死了我也没有去弔伊一弔。現在當戲台上的洪蓮香。是眞的洪蓮香。看伊一個溫柔美麗的女子。被人家生生糟塌死了。那一副眼淚。是爲了伊淌的。第二。我自已的身世。也和蓮香差不多。我也曾經幾次要尋死。可恨自已没有蓮香那般决心。現在我想想。倒是死的好。還有人可憐伊。給伊同情下淚。我們不死的。眞是活現世。活受罪。翠筠本來洗好了臉了對着大鏡子。用鉛筆在畫一條眉毛。傍邊是一張大沙發椅。説到那裏。好像身子無力似的。便向沙發上一躺。把面孔伏在沙發的靠手上。只見伊兩肩的起伏不定。把滿房間的人都嚇呆了。左詩晨也剛洗好了手。猛可裏聽伊不講下去了。一回頭。見了這情狀。便道。咦怎麽樣。連忙過來。扳伊的肩頭。説道。都是我不好。儀管敎你講下去。講下去。招出你自已的傷心來了。你瞧。剛剛洗好了的臉。又是淚眼糢糊了。可不是擦了一個臉。人家的堂唱。眞等得心焦死了。亂着呌房間裏的人。再打面湯水來。翠筠方纔歏了幾口氣。從新揩了一個面。臨走的時候。再三關照左詩晨不要去。等着伊回來。一兩個堂唱。那是很快的。洪蓮香的事。我還没有講完咧。左詩晨明知道這是一句騙他的話。人已死了。事實也没有了。本來做戲那件事。已經是餘波了。還有什麽可講的呢。不過因爲這一席話的反招出伊的傷心來。却是很爲不安。好在伊的堂唱不多。一刻兒工夫就回來了。也可以解勸解勸伊。人生意味。也不過如此。凡事看得開一點。他可以省一點煩惱。不過那些話。也是一種浮廓落落的話。那裏可以解得一個浮沈塵世。心醉虚榮的娼門女子的心胸。果然不一刻兒。翠筠回來了。還是那樣高興健談的樣子。因説吃了蟹不吃飯是不好的。點幾樣菜來吃飯吧。左詩晨道。飯是吃不下了。買一點稀飯來吃吧。翠筠便吩咐去配幾樣吃粥小菜。左詩晨問伊道。你剛纔説有關於洪蓮香的話。到底是什麽話。翠筠道。那是騙騙你的。還有什麽話呢。那齣戲後來殷家花了一點錢。也不再做了。洪蓮香的棺材。在蘇州鄉下買了一塊地葬了。只怕現在靑草都已生滿了。</p>

<p>世界各國棉紡自歐戰停止後、迅速進步、至近所以世界一般物價之低落、呈生産過剩之趨勢迨最近而益爲顯著、尤以歐美爲甚、亞洲方面則比較的爲進步、茲將最近十年之世界紡織機及原棉銷費統計、列表如下、（單位爲千）</p>

<p>觀上表一九三零年之紡綻較之一九二七年爲少、可見棉紡業之趨向頽疲、查今年比去年總數减少僅九萬一千枚、其中歐洲比减四十萬零五千枚、美洲减七十二萬枚、惟亞洲則增九十七萬二千枚、其他亦增六萬二千枚、可見歐美紡業頽風之盛也、亞洲方面以種種關係反得進展其中印度增十九萬八千枚、日本增五十四萬二千枚中國增二十二萬七千枚、惟印席自三月起以革命空氣之澎漲棉廠工作亦减日本以金解禁與金價高漲呈不景氣象、獨中國以外貨輸入减少工作狀况尙比較的良好、</p>
<p>原棉銷用因棉製品貿易之不利、亦隨之减少、其中以美棉减少獨巨、他如印度棉等則反見增加、蓋銷用美棉主要之美洲、其棉業之不振狀態爲最顯著更以低級品之增加致較廉之印棉有代用之傾向、而其他各地方努力植棉亦足以减少美棉之用途也、茲將最近十年之各種棉花銷費表　如下、（單位五百镑重千包）</p>

<p>百餘工人泰半灼傷</p>
<p>燒死者約有四五人</p>
<p>廠屋軍衣機器咸付一炬</p>
<p>閘北共和路福昌軍衣第三廠、昨日下午三時五十分突然失愼、廠工百餘人、大半爲火灼傷、因而喪失生命者、約四五人、其一時無數可稽者、尙不在内、全廠損失材料·軍服·機器·及房屋等、約在三萬元左右、自三時五十分起火、燒至五時半始已、樓房十幢、平房五間、均付一炬、</p>
<p>專製軍衣福昌軍衣第三廠、係由公共租界百老匯路外虹橋堍福昌號所分設、原營呢絨疋頭、其後改業軍裝、近來因營業發逹、乃於本年八月底、在閘北山陽路及共和路分設一二兩廠、專製軍服、其共和路之第三廠、雖係臨時性質、而雇用工人甚多、翻製棉軍衣第一批、計四萬套、最近又向南京總司令部投標、承接大批軍服、於是總號及一二分廠、均日夜開工、趕製新服、</p>
<p>突然失火昨日失愼之第三分廠、在閘北共和路華康路口二百零九號、最初係織布廠、其後由飽林設棉花廠租得、本年八月底、轉租於福昌、廠屋共計樓房十幢、平屋五間、福昌軍衣廠所租者、計靠共和路之平屋五間、及樓房五椽、其餘則爲鮑林記廢花廠所自用、尙有永亭·錦泰·兩家、亦分設其内、福昌軍衣廠所雇之工人、都係女工、數約百餘人、男工祇十餘人、昨日下午三時五十分許、忽聞翻花間中一片呼喊、大呼火警、各工人聞警之下、莫不驚惶失色、奪門逃生、</p>
<p>火勢甚熾棉花原係易燃之物、况軍衣中所用者、均已加以飛彈輕鬆乾燥、尤易着火、故处自樓下翻花間中失愼後、片刻間上下蔓延、火舌四竄、全廠房屋、均爲烟氣火熖所迷漫、頓時間秩序大亂、女工等呼救狂喊、毫無辦法、加以大多人均在樓上、一聞火警、莫不爭先恐後、奪梯逃生、人多梯小、欲下不能、於是被火灼傷者、乃不計其數、</p>
<p>灌救不易火起後、閘北各段救火會均驅車到塲灌救、一段救火會到塲尤早、救火機車到塲者、不下十餘輛、竭力施救、無如廠内所儲之棉花、有二百五十包之多、製就之軍服、又有七八十件左右、着火後、花絮到處飛舞、連環燒燃、馴至無往而非火種、雖有飛泉百道、亦難挽救、且廠屋建築、亦已陳舊、摧朽拉枯、一觸即倒、故一面施以射水、一面又須救護廠工、頗屬不易、</p>
<p>大半灼傷該廠工人十之九、係女工作之時、尤多携帶兒女前往游玩、故廠中孩童亦多、起火後、母尋其女、父覓其子、哭聲震天、除在樓下及年富力强者、得以就近奪門逃生者外、十之七八、均遭火熖灼傷、幸經救火員竭力施救、將濃熖逐漸撲滅、一面令工人奪路而出、然被火灼傷及跌撲受傷者、已在六七十人之多、</p>
<p>哭臨醫院女工被火灼傷者、一時狂喊呼痛、手足無措、幸新民路普善醫院所在不遠、於是尙能步行者、均負傷呼喊、哭臨普善醫院求救、該院醫生、其初見到院者、不過六七人而已、以爲火勢尙輕、孰知正在包紥施治間、其後三四成羣、狼狽而入者、不計其數、且呼且哭、煞是可憐、於是由朱醫生等督率助手看護等次第施治、前後不下六十餘人、</p>
<p>死傷一斑火至五時半左右火始熄滅、被火燒死及灼斃者、一時尙無從調查、惟除投普善醫院求治之六十餘人外、其餘由公安局救火會等分送紅十字會醫院、寳隆醫院、仁濟醫院、及廣仁醫院等等救治、已知之死者如下、計普善醫院二人、紅十字會醫院一人、寳隆醫院陳卡氏及王彩林、住院者、仁濟醫院朱順之甬人、十二歲、寳隆醫院王采林、江北、十四歲、普善醫院顧兪氏、三十三歲、孟河人、李胡氏、三十二歲、徐州人、葉兪氏、四十三歲、甬人、袁朱氏、四十六歲、紹興人、其女五歲、又有四人送往謙益傷科醫院、均係婦女、</p>
<p>警士彈壓火起時、該管四區公安局派有警士多人、前往火塲彈壓、並將有關係之福昌軍衣廠監工張財華、稽查梁有方、及鮑林紀、廢花廠余端甫、鮑國漢、等拘入區署候訊、福昌軍衣廠之經理、係奉化人鄔德生、開設鮑林記者、則爲甬人鮑林樹、火起時、不在塲、兩廠祗有一部份保有火險、</p>
<p>火場一瞥被燒之處、佔地並不甚廣、在共和路華康路口、即閘北四區分安局舊址之隔壁、記者於火熄後、前往觀看、時有棉花被焚之焦臭氣味、衝入鼻觀、救火員等莫不忙於工作、靠街之短垣竹籬、均已傾倒燒燬、磚瓦枯木、堆滿地上、棉花軍衣、蕩焉無存、惟圍而觀者甚衆、再廠門口有硝磺間一所、火起時、幸未波及、否則損失之巨、爲災之烈、更不堪設想矣</p>

<p>The rumor of the restoration of Hungary has been going on several times. Although its government has repeatedly denied it. However, the conspiratorial activities of the Habsburg royal family are obvious and cannot be concealed. Moreover, it has long harbored the determination to restore, even though it has encountered repeated setbacks and does not regret it. Only, if its problem is truly realized, then its relationship is really big. And it's not just a problem for Hungary alone. Because Hungary after the war. Although it is restricted by the Treaty of Trianon like Austria, it seems to have no ability to invade other countries. However, its surrounding small countries. Such as the Czech Republic, Romania, Yugoslavia, etc. They are suspicious of Hungary due to different races. They are afraid of the expansion of its power. And often want to stop it. Therefore, the actions of the Hungarian government are still extremely important to this day. The establishment of the Little Entente before. It originally contained the intention of defending against Hungarian activities. And agreed that if the Habsburg royal family is resurrected. Then even if they go to war with Hungary, they will not care. Therefore, when Karl tried to restore the throne for the second time. The Little Entente countries all dealt with it with extremely harsh means. Finally, Karl was deposed. And imprisoned on a deserted island. After the recent restoration movement rose again. The Prime Minister of Romania and the Czech Social Democratic Party. Both have expressed opposition. Seen in the newspaper. Then today's theory of restoration, if it is truly realized. Can it not cause a major dispute in diplomacy? Therefore, I say that this issue is actually related to the overall situation in Central Europe. Instead of. It's just a problem for Hungary alone</p>

<p>Report from National Society in Copenhagen on the 1st: This place suddenly encountered a severe earthquake this morning, which Danes have never seen before. When the houses suddenly shook, the residents were extremely panicked and ran to the streets. The inland sea and southern Sweden also experienced the same earthquake. Although there were no major losses this time, northern Europe has rarely seen earthquakes, and recently Danes have heard of the tragic disasters of major earthquakes elsewhere, so the people are extremely panicked. Another telegram stated that after the sudden earthquake here this morning, fortunately, it did not continue. However, the residents everywhere are talking about earthquakes with fear.

<p>Electric Communication, Wushe, 2nd: As a result of the Japanese army's general attack on the aborigines on the 1st, the aborigines suffered heavy losses, and the Japanese army also suffered some deaths and injuries. The Japanese army launched an attack on three routes on the 2nd, namely the main force of the suppression team, Major Matsui, with the police team and Takai's cavalry team as the main battle team, attacking the Maheho community from the right after turning at Tawan. In addition, the Hualien Port team and the West River team attacked the back of the Maheho Valley. The Hualien Port team, which attacked from Bualun, launched a general attack from the front, intending to pursue the aborigines to the Maheho Valley and annihilate them.</p>
<p>Japanese United News Agency, Pulixi, 1st: The army unit from Hualien Port attacked the aboriginal area and fought fiercely for four hours. The aborigines could not hold out and fled into the mountains. Two soldiers were killed and seven were injured.

<h3 id="e52">South American Revolutionary Tide <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Uruguay, Ecuador, and Paraguay All Unstable</p>
<p>Only Colombia and Venezuela Spared</p>
<p>Economic Instability</p>
<p>Is the Main Cause of Revolution</p>
<p>Argentine Capital Dispatch: In recent months, various countries in Central and South America have been affected by the global economic downturn, leading to widespread hardship among the people. Revolutionary events have sprung up as a result. In the past three months, the governments of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru have been overthrown in succession. Now, Uruguay also shows signs of instability, while Ecuador and Paraguay are brewing chronic revolutions. Currently, only Colombia and Venezuela have not been affected. The direct cause of these revolutions in various countries is, in fact, nothing more than global overproduction. However, the revolutionary leaders will, under no circumstances, admit this. The United States of America, with its vast territory and strong power, has a natural method of resisting global overproduction: raising import rates. South American countries, with their small territories and weak power, lack the means to resist the economic invasion of other powerful countries. The people direct their grievances at the government, which is then forced to fall. This is why Argentina's Irigoyen, Peru's Leguía, and Bolivia's Siles were ultimately overthrown. The Argentine revolution was due to the world's overproduction of grains, the Bolivian and Peruvian revolutions were due to the world's overproduction of metals, and the Brazilian revolution was due to too much coffee – all undeniable facts. The old governments of these four countries have already been overthrown. What about the countries that are about to fall or have not yet fallen? Uruguay is currently suffering from a surplus of wool, while Paraguay is suffering from a surplus of oranges, with prices falling lower and lower. Small farmers are suffering more and more. Ecuador's situation is slightly different. Ecuador is mostly mountainous, and its people can be divided into those who live in the mountains and those who live in the plains. The current unrest is due to the mutual infighting between these two groups. President Ayora is leaning towards the mountain dwellers, intending to move the capital from Guayaquil on the plains to Quito in the mountains, greatly angering the people of the plains, creating the risk of a revolution. This is a major cause. Economically, Ecuador is also inevitably affected by the same adverse effects as other countries. Therefore, as long as the world's economic situation remains unstable, the revolutions in South American countries will continue to rise and fall. Only after economic stability can political problems gradually stabilize. (World)</p>

<p>Opinions of the Former Speaker of the Indian Legislative Assembly</p>
<p>Authorities Should Release Detained Revolutionary Leaders</p>
<p>Calcutta Dispatch: The former Speaker of the Indian Legislative Assembly, Yakub (an Indian), recently expressed his views on the upcoming Round Table Conference on Indian constitutional affairs to be held in London. He believes that the selection of Indian representatives, in the current situation where the All-India Congress Party firmly refuses to send representatives to participate in the conference, is already within the possible range to represent all aspects. While he highly approves of the Round Table Conference, he believes that opening it at this time is not as good as postponing it to May of next year. Since the leaders of the All-India Congress Party are still in detention, it would be best for the authorities to release these people and then discuss all peaceful solutions to achieve a just and satisfactory resolution. Perhaps these leaders, after being released from prison, might change their stubborn minds and be willing to join the Round Table Conference. Furthermore, if the Round Table Conference were to open at this time, the time would be very short, and it might not be successful. It should be especially noted that the reason why the negotiations between Gandhi and other revolutionary leaders and the representatives of the Indian authorities ultimately broke down was partly because these negotiations were conducted in prison, where the psychological and physiological conditions could incline the detainees towards extremism. Therefore, he believes that if Gandhi and others could be released from prison immediately, they might change their opinions after breathing fresh air. In his opinion, Gandhi, Patel, the Nehru father and son, Mrs. Naidu, etc., should all be released immediately to meet and exchange views with the other Indian leaders who have already been appointed as representatives to the Round Table Conference. However, the Governor-General of India should not participate in these talks.</p>

<p>Greatly Different from the Ministry of Finance's Review</p>
<p>Japanese United Press, Tokyo, 2nd: As a result of yesterday's meeting of the Ministry of the Navy, the naval replenishment plan has been largely finalized as follows. Navy Minister Abo plans to request the understanding of Chief of the Naval General Staff Taniguchi in the next day or two, and then begin negotiations with Finance Minister Inoue. The total amount of the plan is 430 million yuan. 1. "Naval Vessel Replenishment Expenses": 160 million yuan for the construction of vessels within the limitations, and 80 million yuan for the construction of vessels outside the limitations. 2. "Aircraft Replenishment Expenses": 49 million yuan for the establishment of 14 additional air squadrons, 50 million yuan for their maintenance, 7 million yuan for the manufacture of 70 carrier-based aircraft, and 3.5 million yuan for their maintenance. 3. "Substantial Content Expenses": 70 million yuan for the improvement of battleships, 5.5 million yuan for the establishment of an aircraft research institute, and 5 million yuan for improving education and training fees, fuel fees, etc.</p>
<p>The above plan differs from the Ministry of Finance's review of 320 million yuan by 90 million yuan. However, the Ministry of the Navy is determined not to concede, and the government, based on the spirit of the naval disarmament treaty and its promise to the people, plans to resolutely implement a tax reduction of 180 million yuan. The conflicting opinions are brewing a major crisis in the formation of the budget for the next fiscal year. Finance Minister Inoue is extremely worried about this issue and will soon discuss a solution with Navy Minister Abo.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Rubber and Tin Industries Decline, Central Malaya Studies Grain Planting <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Shifting the Core Industry of Malaya</p>
<p>Developing Malaya's Food Self-Sufficiency</p>
<p>Special South Seas Dispatch: It is universally known that rice is an essential food for the people. Although Malaya is an area rich in agricultural products, the rice and grain that are related to daily consumption must rely on the supply of foreign rice, which is indeed a shortcoming of Malaya. The reason why rice planting in Malaya has not been developed is said to be due to the hot weather, abundant rainfall, and the fact that wasteland is overgrown with weeds, making it a laborious task to cultivate fields for rice planting. However, the most important reason is that the people's habits are focused on planting rubber trees. Planting rice requires cultivation and irrigation, while planting rubber trees only requires removing weeds to ensure the lush growth of the trees. Moreover, planting rubber trees allows for harvesting for more than ten years without exhaustion, which cannot be compared to the annual harvest of rice once or twice a year. The planting area of rubber in Malaya has increased rapidly since 1923, which is a general manifestation of the people's enthusiasm for planting rubber. However, times have changed, and the two native products of rubber and tin that have created Malaya's prosperity have fallen in price due to the imbalance between production and consumption, and the price drop is now equivalent to waste. Those who previously opened up rubber plantations in order to make huge profits have today tasted the bitterness of expensive rice due to the fall in rubber prices. Looking back on the past and thinking about the future, how can we not urgently plan good strategies to improve the situation? Malaya's dependence on foreign rice is so great that the amount is astonishing. Taking Penang as an example, in January of this year, the rice imported from various parts of Yangon amounted to 127,037 bags of white rice, and about 170,000 bags of broken rice and brown rice. Due to the labor unrest in Yangon in April and May, the amount of rice imported decreased slightly, but on average, about 250,000 bags of rice are imported from abroad every month in the first six months of this year. Penang's reliance on foreign rice is so great, and other places are self-evident. Therefore, since the price of rubber has fallen day by day, the study of planting rice and grain to achieve Malaya's food self-sufficiency has become increasingly active. The strongest advocate for rice planting is the Governor of Singapore, Clementi. Clementi believes that relying on the two industries of rubber and tin to obtain future happiness is unreliable, and that this rubber and tin failure is a good opportunity to develop other industries. It is especially urgent to plant rice and other grains widely in Malaya. Clementi spoke earnestly about the study of rice planting in the Colonial Legislative Council on September 29, the Federal Council on October 8, and the audience of the Malay monarchs on October 11, which shows Clementi's deep and far-sightedness. Since rubber and tin cannot be eaten and the supply of foreign rice is not abundant, the people of Malaya will inevitably sigh that there is no rice to eat. At the Malayan Federal Council on October 8, in order to develop Malaya's rice self-sufficiency, a member advocated giving wasteland to the natives to plant rice without paying land tax, and prohibiting the leasing of wasteland to the people for planting rubber trees. The government also acknowledged that "the government is now making every effort to encourage the planting of rice in this country, and at the same time prevent the planting of rubber in Malaya. The former is to hope that Malaya will achieve rice self-sufficiency in the future, and the latter is for the sake of the future of the rubber industry." The agreement of the federal governments to plant rice is as clear as watching fire. Governor Clementi also requested economic assistance from the Minister of the Colonial Office in London for the rice planting matter, and sent experts to conduct actual surveys in Kelantan and other places to plan good strategies to develop rice fields. The Colonial Minister has agreed to this matter. It is expected that Clementi's trip to the UK on the 17th will include the discussion of rice planting to shift Malaya's industry. Clementi has also formed a committee in Malaya to focus on studying this matter. The hope of planting rice will be realized one day. Then, how will the hardworking overseas Chinese have a long-term vision to compete with others for survival? (Posted by Xiaohui on October 16)</p>

<p>National News Agency, Paris, 1st: US Ambassador and Chief Representative to the Geneva Disarmament Conference Gibson is still in Rome today, contacting Italian government officials on disarmament matters. Italian newspapers have not yet commented on this, but French newspapers have predicted that there will be no results. It is generally believed that Gibson's trip is inevitably filled with maximal optimism and minimal real news. French newspapers also report that it is certain that if French security clauses are approved, allowing France to build new ships beyond the original tonnage to maintain the current tonnage of French ships exceeding Italian ships, the French government will soon ratify the London Naval Treaty in order to break the current stalemate and at least show, in principle, that France has the sincerity to disarm. According to the views of the French navy and political circles, the current tonnage of French ships exceeding Italian ships is absolutely necessary to guarantee security.</p>

<p>Associated Press, Walker, Oklahoma, 1st: A new oil well here suddenly spilled oil. Experts estimate that the daily oil consumption and loss amounts to 100,000 yuan, and there is no way to stop the spill at this time. Today, the accumulated oil no more than a dozen paces away from the oil well suddenly caught fire. Instantly, all places with oil were affected, and the surface of the Michigan River turned into a fiery dragon. Although more than a thousand public and private personnel and soldiers were engaged in firefighting and prevention work, the fire was still extremely fierce and spreading rapidly. It is said that the oil well cannot be salvaged. Later, only the surrounding houses were blown up, and the fire began to subside slightly. The dangerous period is considered to have passed. At the same time, an economic company in this state, in order to divert the oil flow, has opened all five of its nearby wells. Because several wells are not far apart, it is believed that their oil sources are connected. The release of these five wells will increase the daily oil production by at least 330,000 barrels. The sudden increase in supply in the market will inevitably lead to a sharp drop in market prices, which will not be without impact. The oil well continues to spill oil to this day, with the area within four miles around it being the most dangerous. Outside the four miles, the oil spill is less, and the danger is lighter. Residents in the vicinity, fearing ignition, avoid using all kinds of fire.</p>

<p>Geneva Dispatch: The League of Nations' Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Poisonous Gas, Bacteria, and Chemical Weapons in Wartime has recently been ratified and signed by the Irish Free State. Including Ireland, there are already 27 signatory countries to the convention. The initiation and drafting of this convention dates back to 1925, when the United States put in a lot of effort. However, the United States has still not become a signatory country, which is quite strange. According to the 27 signatory countries to this agreement, they are China, Ireland, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, England, Canada, India, South Africa, New Zealand, Spain, Finland, France, Italy, Liberia, the Netherlands, Persia, Romania, Sweden, Turkey, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Russian Federation, Australia, and Venezuela. Since this convention is most closely related to Europe, most of the more important European countries have joined and approved it. (World)</p>

<p>US Naval Personnel Willing to Sponsor</p>
<p>Repeal the Helium Export Ban</p>
<p>National News Agency, Friedrichshafen, 1st: The world's largest aircraft, Duke, which is currently docked in the floating shed on the shores of Lake Constance, has been test-flown repeatedly and is ready to begin its first transatlantic flight tomorrow morning. It will first fly along the Rhine for about five hours, arriving in Amsterdam, Netherlands. There are 12 crew members on board, and the flight director is Captain Christensen. At this time, the only passengers are the owner and designer of the aircraft, Dornier, and his brother. After arriving in Amsterdam, it will carry 40 to 50 passengers, passing through Southampton, England, Le Havre, France, and arriving in Lisbon, Portugal. When departing from Lisbon for the transatlantic flight, it will still only carry a few journalists and a large amount of mail. The remaining tonnage will be used to load 20 tons of spare fuel in case of emergency. During the journey, it will land on the Azores and the Bermuda Islands to add fuel. The aircraft has 12 engines with a total of 7,200 horsepower, consuming 400 gallons of fuel per hour and achieving a speed of 200 miles. According to Dornier, this will be the last test flight. If the results are satisfactory, a company will be jointly established by German and American merchants next year to try to use heavier-than-air flying vehicles to open a regular transatlantic air route.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, October 12: US government aviation experts have not shaken their confidence in the ultimate success of airships for ocean transport due to the tragedy of the British airship R-101. However, they feel that light gas is not suitable for such airships. The US law prohibiting the export of helium may be repealed as a result of the R-101 accident. Representative Beery Dalton, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, has indicated that he intends to sponsor a bill to repeal this ban. Rear Admiral Muffet also publicly stated on the day of the R-101 accident that this ban should be repealed immediately to benefit all countries, especially the UK and Germany, which have done a great deal to develop lighter-than-air airships. When the US Congressional Committee reviewed the naval appropriation bill in the previous session, a representative of the Louisville Helium Company stated that someone had previously requested permission to export 1.2 million cubic feet of helium between November 1, 1929, and October 1, 1930, but was rejected by the US Secretary of Commerce. According to the Bureau of Mines, the production of helium ammonia in the year ending June 30 this year was unprecedented. However, the government factory in Amarillo, Texas, although its equipment can produce 24 million cubic feet, only produced about 10 million cubic feet in view of the needs of the US Army and Navy. However, according to Carl Jules, Deputy Secretary of the Navy in charge of aviation affairs, the authorities have not yet formally considered the possibility of exporting helium because no foreign country has requested to purchase this non-flammable gas. However, in peacetime, there is no reason to oppose exports. In view of the R-101 accident and the loss of many lives, it is felt that the use of helium in airships is cost-effective and greatly beneficial. It is said that the manufacturing cost of helium has been greatly reduced this year, with each thousand cubic feet costing US$11.18, compared to the previous US$34,000 per thousand cubic feet, which is truly incomparable.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Achievements of Naval Vessels in Suppressing Bandits <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of the Navy issued its work report for October yesterday, in which the situation of various vessels eradicating bandit communists was described in great detail. The following is specially recorded:</p>
<p>The Yangtze River bandit atmosphere has been rampant in recent months. Fortunately, naval vessels have diligently eradicated them, and the riverbanks have gradually become safer. Chen Shaokuan, Acting Minister of the Ministry, has made extremely meticulous arrangements for deploying vessels and patrolling important ports. Recently, the bandits in various parts of Jinghe, after being dispatched to fight against them, have been subdued and dare not act rashly. Among them, only the bandits in Shangxiache Bay still take the opportunity to cause trouble, and their strength is not weak. Vessels go shallow to fight against them, which is very difficult. The Desheng warship was ordered to fight against them. On the 18th, when patrolling the area, it encountered a small number of bandits who were caught off guard by the arrival of the warship and tried to escape. The warship fired machine guns, and the bandits also fired earth cannons, bombarding the warship. The Desheng warship then returned fire fiercely, annihilating many bandits. The bandits began to be subdued and dared not cause trouble for a week. As the river became shallower and the bandits found that the warship's movements were more difficult, they showed no restraint and began to move rashly again. On the 27th, the Desheng warship sailed to fight against them and fought fiercely with the bandits for a long time. Only because of the terrain, it was unable to carry out a thorough search and annihilation. On the same day, the Jiangkun warship also fought and defeated the bandits in Tanjiachou and other places. Now the situation in this area has gradually eased, and the warships are densely concentrated. Once the army arrives, they can work together to recover Jianli. This is in the Jinghe area. Between Jinwu, bandit communists have always been lurking. After the navy dispatched warships to fight against them repeatedly, the bandits were slightly subdued. At the beginning of the month, Tianjiazhen was besieged by bandits, and the situation was very critical. The navy, hearing the alarm, urgently dispatched the Chutai warship to provide assistance. When the warship approached Tianjiazhen, it fired artillery unexpectedly, and finally defeated the bandits. Tianjiazhen was relieved of the siege. After the warship stabilized the area, it returned to its original defense in Wuxue and patrolled every day. The bandits who were plotting to cross the river south did not dare to succeed. In addition, the Yongsheng and other warships patrolled and searched back and forth from time to time, and the bandits dared not come out again. This is in the Jinwu area. In Changyue and its vicinity, the river water has become shallower in recent days. The vessels still travel back and forth in shallow water with great difficulty. At the beginning of the month, the Chuguan warship sailed from Yuezhou to the Bailuozhou area to patrol and bombarded many bandit ships, killing countless bandits. Since then, it has patrolled back and forth in the Yuezhou Chenglinji Linxiang County area. When the warship patrolled Jing Shanao Bailuoji, it found many ships on the riverbank. Looking into the harbor from afar, bandits were gathering. After firing artillery and guns, the bandits were repelled and many bandit ships were sunk. At that time, there was an alarm that Luoluo had fallen into the hands of bandits. The Naval Command specially transferred the Shunsheng warship to Xiangyin for strict alert to curb the banditry. The warship was ordered to arrive at the Xiangyin River on October 7, and the river defense was consolidated at once. The bandits, because of the arrival of the warship, gradually subdued and dared not invade Xiangyin. The bandits in Yanglinshan on the opposite bank of Linxiang also gathered a hundred ships and plotted to cross the river. The Jiangzhen warship sank countless of them, and the bandits fled far away. The Xianning warship patrolled back and forth between Changsha and Hankou at the beginning of the month and escorted He Jian, the commander-in-chief of the Fourth Army, from Changsha to Hankou to attend the bandit suppression conference in the three provinces. Starting from the 14th, the warship patrolled from Changsha again and did not move to Hankou until the 19th. The Yongsheng warship has been patrolling back and forth in the Yuezhou Xindi area for a long time, and only recently began patrolling Yuegan and came to Beijing for exercises. This is in the Xiangjiang area. The bandit communists in Poyang Lake have been rampant in recent months and have become more rampant. After repeated naval battles, they have been slightly suppressed. The bandits in Pengze were repeatedly defeated by the Navy Lianjing and Chengsheng warships on the 18th and 19th of October. The bandits could not support them and fled from Pengze on the same day. Their whereabouts are now in the Huangtupo Xingling area. They are now being thoroughly searched. At the same time, because the situation in Madang is also very tense, the ministry has specially dispatched the Jiangzhen warship to patrol. The lake bandits were even more frightened. When General Commander Jiang heard the news, he sent a special telegram to the Ministry of the Navy on the 27th, ordering them to commend the warships. At the same time, Zouchang was besieged by bandits, and the situation was very critical. Acting Minister Chen heard the alarm and urgently dispatched the Jiangxi warship to provide assistance. After receiving the order, the warship immediately sailed from Wucheng in the early morning of the 20th and forced an attack. The bandits were already shocked and at a loss when they saw the warship. They were also fiercely attacked by the Xi warship with guns and artillery. The bandits could not support it and fled the city. The siege of Duchang was thus lifted. It is reported that the bandits withdrew from Duchang, about thirty miles away. This is in the Poyang Lake area. In addition, the Tonghai and Rong Yingrui warships stationed in the area dispatched soldiers to the shore at the beginning of the month to patrol and suppress the wounded soldiers who were causing trouble, which was stabilized. In addition, pirates robbed fishing boats in Zhejiang. After dispatching many warships to fight against them, several pirate ships were captured by the Haigu gunboat, and the pirates fled. Currently, Yisheng Haou and other boats patrol back and forth in Wenzhou Haimen and Kanmen Foutoushan, and the guards are very strict.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Preparations for the Great Eastern Port <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Interview with Authorities of the Construction Commission</p>
<p>The Great Eastern Port is one of the important construction projects in Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited the authorities of the Construction Commission yesterday to inquire about the progress of preparatory work in recent years. According to them, "The Construction Commission considers opening the Great Eastern Port as its responsibility. In the spring of the 18th year, it specially dispatched Chen Maojie, the head of the Water Conservancy Department, and Chen Zhanen, the head of the Examination Section, to Zhapu, Haiyan, and Ganpu in Zhejiang to conduct on-the-spot surveys and prepare reports. Subsequently, instruments were purchased and a survey team was organized to collect basic materials as the basis for future port construction design. However, due to the country's financial difficulties, the Great Eastern Port Preparatory Office Survey Team was first established to conduct triangulation and leveling surveys in the port area. Water gauge stations were set up in Zhapu, Haiyan, Ganpu inland rivers, and other places in the port area to observe the high and low water levels of the sea and inland rivers. A climate testing institute was also established in Haiyan to observe changes in the weather. The survey team completed preparations at the end of April of that year and departed in May. By January of the 19th year, the triangulation network and precise leveling survey were completed. The entire line is more than 70 kilometers long, starting from Dushan in Zhapu in the east and reaching Jiu Cang in Haining in the west. All triangulation points and leveling markers are made of concrete to ensure permanence. By February of the 19th year, a climate testing institute was installed in Haining to investigate the economic situation near the port site. At the same time, the triangulation was rectified and advanced surveying was carried out. In April, various calculations and arrangements were completed. In May, the survey of the railway line from the Great Eastern Port to Dongxia was carried out and completed in June. The survey team returned to Haiyan to engage in sorting out all charts and graphs in preparation for port construction. This is the progress of the Great Eastern Port's work in the past year."</p>
<h3 id="e67">Hubei Cotton Merchants Petition in Beijing <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Opinions on Cotton Inspection</p>
<p>In recent years, Hubei's cotton production has progressed very rapidly. The Shanghai market uses Hankou cotton as the standard. The annual trade value often exceeds 100 million taels. Profits and losses are closely related to all industries. Since the establishment of the Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureau by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, government and</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>merchants are inevitably estranged, and disputes arise from time to time. In the autumn of this year, the ministry sent Yang Duo to investigate the truth and confirmed that there were areas that needed to be reformed. The ministry then ordered the bureau to thoroughly rectify. Now that the Industrial and Commercial Conference has opened, Mei Huanhou, the chairman of the Hankou Cotton Export Merchants Association, has specially flown to Beijing. According to an interview with the reporter yesterday, cotton inspection is originally an important national policy, and exporters are all buying in. They are eager to purchase high-quality cotton. How can they resist? However, what the bureau has not recognized is that the Export Merchants Association is the outlet of Hankou, not foreign trade. If we want to promote cotton textile raw materials, we are willing to inspect both domestic and foreign trade uniformly. The ministry's original order clearly stated that no buying or selling is allowed without inspection, but the treatment is unfair. Cotton from local Chinese and foreign yarn factories can be inspected or not at will. Flowers handled by various provinces in Hankou are also not inspected. Only cotton transported to Shanghai is subject to particularly strict inspection. As a result, unscrupulous merchants can still take advantage of the situation. The cost is different, which is enough to make the Shanghai cotton industry fail. Now, the Hankou Import Merchants Association (formerly known as Huang Bang) also advocates joint inspection of imports and exports in order to respect the country's intention to improve production. The malpractice of adulterating cotton is due to the counties. If imports and exports must be inspected, then inferior goods cannot gain a foothold in the market, and the counties will also have to realize it. The Import Merchants Association has expressed this, which shows that merchants have thoroughly understood the government's purpose. At the same time, they also requested that cotton purchased by yarn factories and various provinces should be inspected uniformly, so that the inspection fees they bear are not biased. The Hankou cotton industry will definitely be able to restore its old situation. As for cotton exporters, they cannot export without inspection vouchers, which seems to be impossible to restrict imports. However, the bureau only needs to issue a notice to exporters that all cotton for inspection must be submitted with the import inspection voucher, otherwise no inspection will be allowed, so there is no need to worry. Mr. Mei also said that the association and the Import Merchants Association have jointly suggested to the Industrial and Commercial Conference, and Zhou Xingtang and Liu Shaoyan have introduced it. The main points are (1) universal inspection (no buying or selling is allowed without inspection), (2) please reduce inspection fees, (3) waive re-inspection fees, (4) return sample cotton, (5) the standard should be moderate, (6) open inspection. The market conditions of Hankou cotton are not only related to the cotton textile industry, but also have a close impact on the promotion of cotton fields in Hubei Province. It is believed that the Industrial and Commercial Conference will not neglect it.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Negotiations on the Construction of Forts in the French Concession in Hankou <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Writes to the French Consulate Requesting Removal</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The French Concession in Hankou recently built many command posts resembling fortresses on the street, with tunnels inside and gun holes outside, seemingly preparing for war. The Hankou Municipal Party Department believes that the construction is likely to cause misunderstandings among the people, so it wrote to the Municipal Government to negotiate with the French Consulate for removal. On the 1st of this month, the Municipal Government wrote to French Consul Luergen, requesting its removal to avoid misunderstandings. The original letter said, "To whom it may concern: The letter from the Hankou Special Municipal Party Department Temporary Arrangement Committee stated, according to the report from the Third District Party Department, the proposal by Committee Member Ke Tinggen regarding the construction of fortress-style command posts in the French Concession of this city, which sullies our national character, was discussed in detail at the Tenth Executive Committee Meeting of the district. It was unanimously agreed that the command posts on ordinary roads are used to raise the police's foothold, enlarge the target, and facilitate the command of vehicles and pedestrians, with the purpose of organizing traffic. The command post is only a simple tool for traffic. There is also this equipment on Zhongshan Road in this city. However, the command posts recently built in the French Concession have tunnels inside and gun holes outside, with sand-covered iron bones and a very strong structure. Transportation and defense are extremely convenient. Even front-line projects are not as good as this. Its intention is not only to command traffic, but also seems to be preparing for war. At this time when unification is about to be realized and revolutionary diplomacy is being vigorously implemented, the French Consul disregards national friendship and despises our national sovereignty, openly planning for war within the territory of the Republic of China. This kind of command post is the same as the gunboat policy in intimidating our people and bullying our country. Moreover, the concession is adjacent to ten offices above and eleven offices below, with the river in front and the eighth and ninth offices behind. The military and police are everywhere, and the defense is also complete. It is even more difficult to excuse it for preventing bandits. Why build such a fortified wall and snore in front of the couch? It is really heartbreaking. After discussion, it was decided to submit to the superior Party Department and forward the letter to the Municipal Government for serious negotiations and</p>
<p>return to the concession, recorded on file, which should be recorded on file and submitted to your committee for review and handling, which is convenient for the Party to come forward. After investigating the suggested section, there is still some insight. Correspondingly, I write to your government to inform you of the situation, and ask you to check and handle it, etc. After investigating the command post, the building is magnificent, just like a fortress, or it may be a temporary expedient measure for joint prevention during the military emergency period when the bandits and communists were lurking in Wuhan. The citizens can still understand it together. Now that the military affairs have ended and the bandits have gradually disappeared, and the land and water areas have also been lifted from the military emergency period, this kind of wartime architectural structure is really unnecessary to set up. It should be requested to be removed to avoid misunderstandings among the citizens and to complete the friendship between the two countries. In addition to replying to the letter, I hereby write to your consul, and ask you to check and handle the reply. (November 1st)"</p>
<h3 id="e69">Hunan Legal Representatives Request Troops to Suppress Communists <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Provincial Party Department Committee Members Go to Beijing and Hankou to Petition</p>
<p>Representatives of Various Groups Go to Hankou to Plead for Assistance</p>
<p>Determined Not to Return to Hunan Until the Goal Is Achieved</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The troops of the suppression of bandits in Hubei and Jiangxi provinces have been transferred from the front one after another. Together with the original troops of the suppression of bandits, there are more than ten divisions. However, the troops of the suppression of bandits in Hunan are only part of the Fourth Route Army. Although they are called four divisions, the actual number is probably less than three divisions. In addition, the 19th Division of Li Jue, which is known as the elite of the Fourth Route Army, has also entered Pingxiang and Yuanzhou in Jiangxi to assist the bandit suppression in Jiangxi. Therefore, the bandit suppression force in Hunan is the weakest compared with Hubei and Jiangxi provinces. The usual trick of the Communist bandits is to avoid the real and attack the empty. As a result, the two bandits, He Long and Kuang Jixun, invaded Hunan from Honghu, Hubei, and occupied Nanhua and other counties. There is also news that the two bandits, Peng Dehuai and He Changgeng, have returned to their old nest in Pingliu, Hunan, from Shanggao and Wanzai in Jiangxi. Moreover, part of Huang Gonglue's troops has invaded Chayou in Xiangdong. In addition, the bandit forces along the Changyue Zhuli Railway are growing day by day, and the tracks are often damaged. If the troops of Hubei and Jiangxi provinces continue to press on the Communist bandits, the Communist bandits will inevitably take advantage of the emptiness and flee to Hunan again. It is no different from using Hunan as a ditch. Therefore, the general people of Hunan are extremely frightened. He Jian knows that his military strength is insufficient, so he has telegraphed to Director He in Hankou to send two more divisions to Hunan for assistance, but he has not yet seen them. Because the situation is urgent, the Hunan Provincial Party Department specially dispatched Committee Member Wang Qi to Beijing and Hankou to request the rapid dispatch of three or four divisions of troops to Hunan. At the same time, the Hunan Rehabilitation Committee also sent Huang Zhenyuan as a representative, the Provincial Education Association sent Cheng Xiwu as a representative, and the General Chamber of Commerce sent Wang Yinheng as a representative. On the 30th, they went to Hankou together to ask He Cheng𤀹 to send more than four divisions of elite troops to Hunan to suppress the bandits and save the people of Hunan. It was decided not to return to Hunan until the goal was achieved. The following is the letter from the three groups of the Rehabilitation Committee, the Provincial Education Association, and the General Chamber of Commerce to Director He: "Stealing the province's bandit disaster, before the combination of Zhu, Mao, Peng, Huang and other shares, harassed Changsha, at the beginning it was already陷落, and then it was in danger. Fortunately, the two divisions of Gong (Bingfan) and Luo (Lin) went to the rescue one after another, and the bandits fled to Jiangxi in various ways. However, the remaining bandits scattered in various counties in Xiangdong are still rampant and abnormal. The situation between Xiangyin and Yueyang is particularly fierce. Therefore, the stations in Luotao Forest and other places were burned down. However, it can still be said that the large shares have fled far away, and only the remnants remain, which can be gradually suppressed. However, since the army was divided into Jiangxi and Hubei to suppress the bandits, the bandits have returned to Xiang. Yin Yue, which had not been cleaned up before, is becoming more and more rampant, while Ping Liu, which has been陷落 for a long time, is becoming more and more rampant. Moreover, in the northwest, Huarong Nanhua county was lost at the same time, and in the southeast, You County Chaling reported the alarm one after another. From the perspective of the topography of the province, the bandits of Nanhua can support the bandits of Yin Yue, and the bandits of Chayou can enter Changsha from Zhuli. Now the bandits in Nanhua are huge, and the provincial army should be rushed to suppress them, while the area of Zhuli is still empty. Moreover, according to investigation,</p>
<p>County Guitong has been бандит, surrounded by chaos, taking Xiang as a ditch. If you do not ask for help urgently, you will definitely have no people. I think that your seat is in charge of the bandit suppression affairs in the three provinces, and the Party and the country are relying on you as a dry city, and the people are relying on you as a guarantee. We hope that you will implement the overall planning and suppression. In addition to sending representatives Huang Zhenyuan, Wang Yinheng, and Cheng Xiwu to Chenwai in detail, I hereby ask you to examine and approve, and quickly send more than four divisions of elite troops to Hunan to suppress the bandits day and night, and ask you to send planes and warships to偵擊 in advance to put out the chaos and solve the倒懸, no one can 任屏營待命之至."

If the telephone company fails to repay the debt by then, the court will enforce it compulsorily. Japanese lawyer Mou Shaozhou feared that the telephone company's assets would change, so he submitted the company's asset list to the court as a guarantee and applied to the court to prohibit the telephone company from registering assets in the future to avoid transfer. It is heard that the Japanese side really intends to seize the Jinan Telephone Company and manipulate the city's traffic, so Governor Han Fuju of Shandong Province is paying special attention to this case. The telephone company's telephone union has also issued a telegram, appealing to all sectors of the city. The following is the Jinan Telephone Company's petition to the court for revocation of provisional execution: "Stealing the company and Japanese Kagawa Masakazu debt litigation, has been declared dissatisfaction within the statutory period in the case, in addition to the letter of reason for the debt part is submitted in another case, first of all, the reason for the dissatisfaction with the provisional execution part is submitted to request a ruling, ㈠ Reason, the original judgment contains, and then check Article 463 of the Civil Procedure Regulations contains that if the creditor clarifies that it will be difficult to compensate or calculate the damage if the execution is not performed before the judgment is confirmed, the court shall declare provisional execution according to its application, etc., carefully check the amount of debt in this case is 420,000 Japanese yen, together with interest, no less than 600,000 Japanese yen, compared with the current gold price, it is about more than 1 million silver coins, and the economic situation in the society, the gold price rises and falls uncertainly, the company's assets, in addition to the machines, only a few sections of land, Jinan Boshan real estate one place, machines and other things have been used for a long time, the price is overdue, if the execution is waited until the judgment is confirmed, it is really difficult, and it is difficult to calculate the worry, the plaintiff has clarified this reason, requesting provisional execution, the reason is naturally correct, should be declared provisional execution according to the application, etc., check the company in Boshan and no real estate, the original trial yamen did not investigate with its authority, and quickly identified it, there is a major error in fact, money debt, there is no reason not to calculate, regardless of the wealth of the horse officer and the monk, that is, the company, the original assets of more than 1.6 million yuan, when the accountant checked and estimated can be proved, this year, more than 360,000 yuan was continued, totaling more than 2 million yuan, although there are other debts of hundreds of thousands of yuan, after all, it still exceeds the amount of debt of the appellant, although the machines and other things have been worn down, they can not be seen to fall sharply, and it is impossible to say that the layer is difficult to compensate, and the original judgment is even more lacking in legal points, ㈡ Purpose, request to make a judgment first, revoke the provisional execution part of the original judgment, so as to meet the fairness, respectfully present to the Jinan District Court, and forward it to the Shandong High Court," (31st)</p>

<h3 id="e72">Shanxi Currency Still Has No Solution <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: In addition to arranging military affairs, Yan Xishan has been busy rectifying Shanxi's financial problems. In recent days, he has summoned Qiu Yang𤀹, the director of the Civil Affairs Department, Li Shangren, the director of the Industry and Commerce Department, Wang Mingxun, the director of the Construction Department, Geng Guiting, the director of the Agriculture and Mining Department, and Meng Yuanda, the director of the Finance Department, to the headquarters to hold meetings to discuss and prepare a thorough solution. Therefore, three or four days ago, the citizens were shocked by the atmosphere of the headquarters' continuous discussion of maintaining the provincial currency method, and the price of provincial banknotes rose sharply, from every yuan of silver can be exchanged for four yuan of paper money, to every yuan of silver can be exchanged for one yuan and eight corners of provincial currency. The group said that the authorities should not be difficult to prepare a solution for cash exchange. However, after several days of consultation, there is still no concrete plan. The general people are disappointed again due to suspicion. Until today, the price of provincial currency is low again, and every yuan of silver can be exchanged for two yuan and eight corners of provincial currency. The prices of various goods continue to rise. The official issued a notice yesterday, ordering all merchants to automatically reduce the value of goods with the provincial currency, but the merchants ignored it because the price of provincial currency rose and fell uncertainly, and there was no standard.</p>
<p>The Taiyuan General Chamber of Commerce obtained the consent of the authorities at 1:00 pm yesterday (23rd) (because it has been forbidden to hold meetings and societies), summoned the directors of 20 business firms in the city to hold a financial meeting. At that time, all the directors attended. First, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Wang Zhaotai, reported the purpose of the meeting, and then began to discuss and consult for a long time before passing the following three measures: ㈠ After the winter standard, from November 20th, the city's business firms will sell and buy goods, all using silver or National Bank banknotes as the transaction standard, ㈡ All commercial and civilian debts will be repaid with provincial banknotes at the end of the solar year. From January 1, 20th year, all must be repaid with silver, ㈢ Please the provincial government to lend 1 million yuan of silver to the Taiyuan City Chamber of Commerce, guaranteed by the Taiyuan General Chamber of Commerce, with a period of one year for repayment. On the one hand, the National Bank will issue 1 million yuan of banknotes, which will be stamped by the General Chamber of Commerce and circulated in the market as cash. No discounts will be allowed, and they will be exchanged at any time, and will be recovered in one year. After the three measures were discussed and decided, Chairman Wang presented them to Yan for review and handling. Whether they can be implemented in this way is still unknown. (October 24th)</p>

<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The newly appointed Chairman of Anhui, Chen Tiaoyuan, has been in Shanghai visiting his mother for more than half a month. He was urged by Chairman Chiang to go to Anhui a few days ago. It is heard that he has not yet started his journey, and he will probably return to Beijing in a few days and go directly to Anqing to take office.

<p>The Twists and Turns of Inspecting Wheat: In order to improve agricultural products, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines specially established a wheat inspection office in Shanghai and appointed Jin Wensi as the director. At the same time, Gu Leshan was appointed by the office to come to Wuxi to organize a wheat inspection station to be responsible for inspecting wheat. The Wuxi Rice and Bean Trade Association believes that this matter is closely related to the vital interests of the trade and must be carefully considered. Therefore, a general meeting of all members was held at Yu Tang at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss the measures. More than a hundred executive committee members and representatives of various trades attended. After a collective discussion, it was unanimously agreed that the nature of this county is completely different from that of Shanghai, so there is no need to establish a wheat inspection station. The entire meeting unanimously opposed it and immediately elected Zhao Zixin, Chen Boxian, Feng Yunxiang, Yin Zhujun, Tao Yin fu, Zou Shaoping, Qian Nianxiu, and seven others as representatives. If the inspection station sends someone to come to negotiate, the seven representatives will be responsible for the negotiations, and seven wheat inspection methods will be discussed and presented to the inspection station by the representatives.</p>

They then recruited a licentious monk named Yu to be the abbot of the temple. Later, the monk had an affair with a nun and was caught in the act and sent to the county jail. Residents of the area, such as Zhang Jinyun, believe that the actions of these rascals, such as Jin Rongxuan, are extremely illegal. Therefore, they jointly sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan requesting the county to investigate and deal with the matter. The Executive Yuan has instructed the Jiangsu Provincial Government to investigate and handle the matter in accordance with the allegations in the original petition.

<p>The Tragic Conflict Between the New and Old County Magistrates: The former county magistrate of Dingyuan, Xu Yongxiu, was accused of collecting a tobacco seedling tax. At the same time, a provincial inspector also reported the same to the province. The province dismissed Xu on September 18th and appointed Fang Shaozhou to act in his place on a trial basis. Fang was from Dingyuan. After being appointed, he quietly arrived in Dingyuan on the 7th of this month. Xu refused to hand over his duties and sent police to guard Fang and restrict his freedom. Then he forced him to leave the country. Fang felt humiliated and wanted to avenge himself. The Yongkang Town People's Self-Defense Corps in the county had a bad relationship with Xu. Fang instigated them to seize the county seal by force to avenge Fang. The tragedy was born from this. On the 16th of last month, Fang led more than 200 members of the Yongkang Self-Defense Corps to break into the city, seized the firearms of the sentry police along the way, and stormed into the county government, clashing with the guards. The two sides opened fire on each other, with bullets and guns flying, as if facing a major enemy. At that time, the truth was unclear and it was suspected that bandits had captured the city and were under attack from outside. They could not hold out and retreated. An investigation later revealed that twenty-one people were killed inside and outside the city, and the corpses were scattered, which was a terrible sight. The province has now ordered both sides to refrain from further actions and await a resolution. The post of county magistrate will be filled by Wu Shusheng, the county magistrate of Huaining.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Chairman Chiang's Attitude Towards the NTU Crisis <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Moral of Study is Decayed, the Principal Should Take Full Responsibility</p>
<p>The Highest Institution of Learning, the Government Cannot Stand By</p>
<p>Especially Should Realize That Harm to Youth Education</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from a certain newspaper visited Chairman Chiang in his hometown of Xikou. During the meeting, they discussed the NTU crisis. Chiang said that the National Taiwan University was lax in its discipline, and that Nationalists, reorganizationists, and communists were mixed up among them. He had heard of this from his own investigations over the past two years, and it was not based on the report of Minister Chiang. Principal Zhang should take full responsibility for the poor academic atmosphere of the university. However, he saw no need to reply to the letter of resignation submitted to him personally. The university president is appointed by the government, so the letter of resignation should be formally submitted to the government with respect to the organizational system. In short, the university is a place to cultivate specialized talents, and students' thinking should be guided properly. As the highest institution of learning in the capital, NTU is of utmost importance, and the government cannot sit idly by and allow its school affairs to be delayed and its academic atmosphere to be rampant, so as not to harm young people. Educators are role models for young people and should especially have a responsible sense of awareness, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Exhaustion of Jiangsu Province's Education Funds <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Correspondence Between the Education Bureau and the Management Office</p>
<p>Explaining the Reason for Short Payments of Two Months' Expenses</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Expense Management Office and the Education Bureau have been exchanging correspondence regarding the issue of accumulated unpaid expenses. The following is a transcription:</p>
<p>Letter from the Education Bureau to the Management Office:</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Office:</p>
<p>According to the report submitted by principals such as Zhang Tong of provincial middle and primary schools, it was noted that after the principals took their oaths on September 22nd, the director convened a discussion meeting where the principals expressed the dire economic situation of their schools and requested relief measures. At the time, they were informed that planning was underway and that practical solutions would be available soon. Subsequently, it was learned that the Finance Committee had also convened a meeting and resolved several important matters. There was hope that the suffering of the schools would soon be alleviated. However, up to now, the regular expenses of the schools are still in arrears for two and a half months, and the outstanding temporary expenses from the previous year have not been paid at all. This situation is no different from before the discussion meeting and the Finance Committee meeting. It is extremely perplexing. Schools that have income from tuition and boarding fees have exhausted these funds after covering expenses for two and a half months. Schools without such income have exhausted their borrowing and credit. Teachers' salaries, student meals, and other unavoidable expenses are causing daily despair, reaching a point of helplessness. Principals are busy all day, but what are they doing? Nothing but borrowing and raising funds to deal with debts. This is far from education and deeply disheartening. In total, regarding the regular and temporary expenses of the schools, there are currently five urgent needs that the Bureau must address and manage. These are presented one by one:</p>
<p>(1) The regular expenses for each month from August of this year onward must not be allowed to remain in arrears for two and a half or three months for long. It should not become customary without efforts to rectify and settle the situation. When will the Management Office be able to restore the previous practice of paying regular expenses monthly? The Bureau should strictly inquire and urge until the goal is achieved.</p>
<p>(2) The Finance Committee resolved that the Management Office should raise 60,000 yuan within three days of the meeting to be distributed to the schools for emergency relief, and borrow 300,000 yuan within ten days to pay off the expenses for August. However, the Office has ignored this resolution, failing to comply. The Bureau should strictly question whether the resolutions of the Finance Committee are considered valid by the Office, whether there is an obligation to comply, and how to ensure that the Office improves its performance. If the Office fails to implement the resolutions of the Finance Committee, the Finance Committee should be convened to discuss and deal with the matter.</p>
<p>(3) The provincial government has allocated the first batch of treasury bonds worth 100,000 yuan for the temporary expenses of the 18th year, which can be used to borrow about 70,000 to 80,000 yuan in cash. The schools are eagerly awaiting these temporary expenses like a long-awaited rain during a drought. The Bureau should allocate and distribute this amount of 70,000 to 80,000 yuan to the schools in advance, issuing a list for the Management Office to follow, so that the schools can repay part of their accumulated debts and supplement their recent economic activities.</p>
<p>(4) The provincial government has also allocated 10,000 yuan to the Management Office for the temporary expenses of the 19th year. The Bureau should expedite the fair allocation of the entire budget and specify the percentage to be distributed in installments, so that the Management Office can follow the plan.</p>
<p>(5) All special project expenses in the new budget for the 19th year have been announced. The schools have complied with various projects, relying on the funding stipulated in the original budget for maintenance. The Bureau must immediately inform the Management Office to implement the payments and avoid further changes to prevent significant difficulties in the schools' operations.</p>
<p>The above five points represent the universal economic needs of the schools and their common hopes for the Bureau. The unique situations of individual schools are not included in this list. If these five points can be realized, the maintenance of the schools will not be a problem. However, if the Bureau is unable to address the Management Office's sluggishness or if the approved budget is changed or shelved, the principals will be at their wit's end and unable to cope. In due course, the schools will be like dried fish in a fish market. This is hereby reported, hoping for your review and instructions.</p>
<p>Accordingly, it has been found that the expenses of the provincial schools have been in arrears for several months, and the temporary expenses for the 18th year are still awaiting allocation. The difficulties mentioned are indeed real. Prompt allocation is necessary to provide relief. In addition to issuing instructions, Xue Qin is hereby appointed to discuss the matter in person. It is hoped that you will promptly arrange a meeting.</p>
<p>Letter from the Management Office in Reply to the Education Bureau:</p>
<p>Regarding your esteemed letter, it states that according to the reports of various schools, there are arrears in regular and temporary expenses, and therefore, please urgently find ways to provide relief and appoint personnel for face-to-face discussions and promptly arrange a meeting. Upon review, the five points mentioned in the report by principals such as Zhang Tong of provincial middle and primary schools contain harsh wording regarding our inability to pay regular and temporary expenses monthly, implying that we are deliberately withholding funds. This is extremely alarming. However, the exhaustion of funds and the difficulties in handling affairs must be clearly explained.</p>
<p>In the past, the expenses of the schools were paid monthly without arrears. This was due to prosperous years with smooth tax collection and a relatively balanced budget, allowing for ample arrangements without any financial strain. However, since last year, natural disasters and banditry have struck, making it impossible to rectify the situation, leading to a sharp decline in tax revenue. The total income for the 18th year was only 3,003,900 yuan, while the expenditures, based on the budget, totaled 3,905,600 yuan for regular and temporary expenses. This resulted in a shortfall of 901,700 yuan. Fortunately, there was a surplus of 356,600 yuan from the 17th year to supplement the funds, still leaving a deficit of 545,100 yuan. This amount was either borrowed from banks or allocated by various counties, and the income from July and August of this year was also used to cover the expenses, finally bringing the expenses of the schools for the 18th year to a conclusion. However, this has already encroached on the income of 545,100 yuan for the 19th year. Therefore, at the beginning of this year, we were in a desperate situation with no way out, and the budget was further increased. It is already difficult to cope with the present, and a major crisis is imminent, with the risk of bankruptcy. We dared not agree with the budget proposal because we anticipated the current difficulties.</p>
<p>We are well aware of the urgent need for funds by the schools. Therefore, we have sent personnel to various counties to borrow funds, barely managing to issue the expenses for July. Currently, all the remaining funds in the treasury have been allocated, and we have arranged for a loan of 32,000 yuan from the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China to issue the first half of the expenses for August. Regarding borrowing from banks, we previously invited managers from various banks to a meeting at the Central Hotel, and the Director of the Bureau was also present, providing guidance. We also sent a letter to the Director of the Bureau requesting assistance, but there were no practical solutions. Therefore, Yong Jian personally went to Shanghai twice to negotiate with the banks, and there is some hope that about 100,000 yuan can be borrowed, although it is difficult to reach the target of 200,000 yuan. Once the loan is secured, we will manage to issue the second half of the expenses for August.</p>
<p>We have asked ourselves whether we have spared no effort in raising funds for the expenses of the schools. However, the principals accuse us of ignoring the resolutions and request strict questioning. Furthermore, they state that if we fail to implement the resolutions, we should be dealt with. They do not understand the difficulties of the authorities and do not ask about the difficulties of raising funds, making arbitrary criticisms. Why is there so little understanding? The intention is probably to suspect that we have funds but refuse to release them, accusing us of sluggishness. We welcome an audit by an accountant. The Republican government places great importance on integrity, and all institutions, large and small, should have transparent finances. However, this has not yet been implemented. We are willing to be the first to set an example. Our various account books and receipts are complete. We request that the Bureau promptly send an accountant to audit the accounts to determine whether the income and expenditures are accurate and whether there are any remaining funds. This can be announced not only to the education sector of Jiangsu Province but also to the education sector of the entire country. The budget lists administrative income, but the schools have not yet reported it. We can deduct this amount from the expenses to be issued. We also request that the Bureau send an accountant to audit this as well, so that the financial transparency of Jiangsu's education can set a precedent for the entire country. This is our sincere intention.</p>
<p>In conclusion, all the special education funds received by our office are used for education expenses. Unlike other financial institutions, we do not divert funds for other needs. The methods for raising funds are limited. If we had funds, why would we delay payment? If we do not have funds, it is not easy to find a solution. We dare to lay our hearts bare, hoping for understanding.</p>

<p>Discovery of Coal Dust and Millipedes in Breakfast Sparks Uproar</p>
<p>The Suzhou Agricultural School, a provincial institution, comprises two divisions with a total of 240 students. On the morning of the 31st, students in the second division discovered coal dust and millipedes in their breakfast. They questioned Dai Qixiang, the staff member in charge of catering, but his response was deemed partial by the students. Consequently, the entire student body decided to strike. This action soon spread to the first division. Currently, students from both divisions have issued a declaration demanding the expulsion of instructor Dai. The school principal, Liao Jianan, was unsuccessful in dissuading the students and has reported the incident to the Education Bureau for review. It is rumored that the incident is not solely due to this event and that there are underlying issues.</p>

<p>First Half Two to Zero, Second Half One to Zero in the Scocata Cup Preliminary</p>
<p>The Zhenru football team defeated the Lehua team by a score of three to zero in the Scocata Cup preliminary match yesterday at the Yiyuan football field. Approximately four to five thousand spectators watched the game. Lehua's Li Huitang was reassigned to center back and performed excellently, coordinating well both inside and outside. However, goalkeeper Qu Hongde showed some lapses. The forward line differed slightly from what was reported in yesterday's newspaper, as Yang Renwei and Yang Xingyan were unable to attend and were replaced by substitutes, which did not strengthen the line. Lu Zhongen's center forward position was weak. Zhenru continued to fight hard, winning two goals in the first half and only one goal in the second half despite many opportunities. The lineups of the two teams were as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e95">Zhenru <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>

<h3 id="e97">Lehua Shows Strength <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Lehua initiated the attack, circling within Zhenru's territory for a long time. Gao Dahan passed the ball to the center, which landed in front of Zhenru's goal. After a long struggle, Li Huitang kicked the ball, but goalkeeper Liang saved it. Zhenru then launched an attack, but retreated halfway, and Lehua attacked again. Lu Zhongen's shot missed the goal.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Zhenru Scores <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>After overcoming difficulties, Zhenru launched an invasion with fierce momentum. Lehua's goal was repeatedly in danger. Goalkeeper Qu repelled the attacks twice. Zhenru refused to be outdone. Zhong Lianji saw a high ball coming from the left and rushed forward to meet it. At the same time, goalkeeper Qu also ran out to grab it, but neither succeeded. Dai Linjing got the ball at the 20-yard mark and kicked it towards the goal. At that time, Qu Hongde had run out and failed to catch up. Li Ning saw that the situation was not good and retreated to defend the goal. Unexpectedly, a ball flew in, and Li dared not use his hands. He kicked it with his foot but missed, and the ball went into the net. Zhenru opened the scoring, less than 20 minutes into the game.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Stalemate <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Lehua's line was solid internally, but the forwards were scattered. Lin Bingwen's two crosses were effective, but the central road lacked support, resulting in frequent loss of good opportunities. Once, Lu Zhongen lost the ball by touching it with his hand. As for Zhenru, the army's morale was greatly boosted. The connection was good and Bingxiang advanced along the edge on horseback to an unmanned area, as if to conquer. Seeing that the situation was not good, Li Ning quickly caught up, slashing from the side to block him. Bingxiang was helpless. Later, Bingxiang crossed the ball, and Lianji rushed up to meet it with great power, but his foot was too high and he failed to hit it.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Zhenru Scores Again <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>At that time, both sides faced danger in front of their goals. After about 40 minutes, Zhenru's center forward Dai got the ball 12 yards in front of Lehua's goal, dribbled left and right, and fortunately found a way to go. He shot powerfully towards the goal, and the ball went in from the right corner. Goalkeeper Qu managed to touch the ball but failed to hold it firmly. Zhenru won two goals. The first half ended in less than three minutes.</p>
<h3 id="e101">The Battle Resumes <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Lehua's momentum suddenly increased, and the ball circled in Zhenru's area for a long time. They won two corner kicks in a row, but failed to score. Over time, Lehua fell into danger again. Chen Jiaqiu kicked the corner kick, choosing an excellent angle, and swept to the left along the goalpost, but no one intercepted it. Chen Zhenhe kicked a free kick 30 yards in front of Lehua's goal, shooting towards the goal. Goalkeeper Qu deflected the ball but missed, and it hit the goalpost. Zhenru's Tong Rongwen, who happened to be waiting near the goal, was about to turn around and score, but was penalized for being offside. Lehua was lucky to escape this goal.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Scoring a Hat-Trick <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Before long, Zhenru's five forwards were like dragons and tigers, echoing each other and making full use of their connection to directly attack Lehua's goal, without obstruction. Because the three generals in the middle were engaged in close combat, Lehua's goalkeeper Qu was isolated and without support. He recklessly rushed forward to block, and Tong Rongwen took the opportunity to shoot a goal, making the score three to zero.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Lehua Defends to the Death <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>After that, Lehua was at the end of its strength, and Zhenru's momentum did not wane. Center forward Dai provided support from the middle, and Chen Bingxiang got his help and advanced to the edge, reaching Lehua's goal. Goalkeeper Qu tried to compete, heading straight for the left corner, leaving the goal empty. Goalkeeper Qu almost forgot his position, and the crowd roared with laughter. Later, Dai Linjing shot twice, and Qu saved the ball both times but lost his grip. Fortunately, no one rushed forward, otherwise it would have been over. At the end of the match, Zhenru won three to zero, and Lehua was eliminated.</p>

<h3 id="e116">On the Necessity for Export Merchants to Voluntarily Organize a China Export Trade Association by Shou Jingwei <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, those who discuss China's economic problems have all paid attention to the development of export trade. In the current situation where commercial warfare pervades the globe, all countries are striving to promote their own export trade in order to achieve a trade balance surplus. Such as the post-war tariff system's trend towards protection, the general increase in population tax rates, the utmost promotion of the national goods movement, and the extreme encouragement of export trade, all are widespread phenomena that have occurred in recent years. China, under this trend, especially during the period of expensive gold and cheap silver, to seek relief for the national economy, it is truly not enough to start from encouraging export trade. However, since the opening of trade, China's export trade for several decades has not been optimistic. The long-term trade deficit, the expansion of foreign merchant power, the oppression of the comprador system, the lack of capital of export merchants, and the unsound organization have all manifested the pathological state of China's international trade. From the perspective of the trade deficit, since the Customs records of sixty-six years, there have been no more than six years of trade surplus, while the trade deficit has lasted for sixty years. The total trade surplus is only over 27 million taels (Customs taels), while the total trade deficit has reached over 470 million taels. Comparing the two, the difference is a huge 460 million taels. The trade surplus accounts for only a weak tenth of the trade deficit. This long-term, huge amount of trade deficit is an irreparable loss for China, and it is also one aspect of the unsound state of the national economy. From the perspective of the rise and fall of important export commodities, China's famous silk, tea, egg products, etc., are all declining year by year, and the degree of decline is beyond our expectations. Raw silk has natural advantages and a long history. Although the quantity and value have slightly increased in recent years, the percentage of the total trade has decreased from 32% (1869) to 14% (1928). Comparing with the world's raw silk consumption, the decline in its percentage cannot be measured by miles. The development and competition of the Japanese silk industry in recent years has put great pressure on Chinese merchants. American silk sales have long been filled with Japanese silk. Recently, silk sales have stagnated and silk prices have plummeted. Even the Lyon silk market, which is famous for selling Chinese silk, may hand it over to others. The future of the silk industry is unimaginable. The Chinese tea trade is even more pessimistic. During the Tongzhi and Guangxu years of the Qing Dynasty, Chinese tea was sold almost all over the world. In the early years of Guangxu, the annual export was more than 2 million dan. After the fifteenth year of Guangxu, it gradually declined. In the early years of the Republic of China, there were still 140,000 to 150,000 dan. In the seventh year of the Republic of China, it plummeted to 400,000 dan. In the ninth year, it fell further to 300,000 dan. As for the percentage of the total trade, it fell from 55% (1870) to less than 4% (1928). In recent years, the competition of Indian and Ceylon tea, the stagnation of Russian sales, and the decline in struggle and appeal almost every day are both regrettable and the future situation is precarious. Egg products are exported every year, ranking third or fourth in China's export trade, and are known as silk and tea. The European, American and Japanese sales markets were originally very large. In recent years, they have been affected by the promotion of egg production in various countries and the pressure of increasing tariffs to restrict imports, and they are also decreasing day by day, with no vitality. Other major export commodities such as tung oil, peanuts, and ham are either reducing imports by seeking planting in various countries, or restricting them by various excuses, and they are all declining. This is the actual situation of some important export commodities in China. It can be seen that the symbol of the decline of China's export trade is undeniable. From the perspective of gold and silver imports and exports, imports have been the most in recent years. In the seventeenth year, the net surplus of silver imports was 10.6 million taels, and in the eighteenth year, it was 88 million taels. On the one hand, there is a trade deficit, and at the same time, gold and silver imports and exports are also imports. This is a special phenomenon in China, and it is also one aspect of the unsound national economy. Therefore, from all aspects, the extreme promotion of China's export trade is urgent and cannot be delayed. There are many discussions on the methods of promoting international trade, which can be summarized into two aspects: the government's promotion and the merchant's automatic improvement. Regarding the government's aspects, there are several points:</p>
<p>1. Establishment of the International Trade Bureau. The International Trade Bureau is the main government agency for subsidizing trade development. On the one hand, it investigates the situation of foreign markets and collects trade statistical data. On the other hand, it provides specialized suggestions and strong assistance to export merchants. At the same time, it has the obligation to mediate and promote trade disputes and financial activities. The British Overseas Trade Bureau (founded in 1917, is the central agency for reporting overseas industrial and commercial information), the Market Development Bureau (founded in 1921, is an organization to promote export trade, in addition to the headquarters, there are also local offices, cooperative offices, and overseas commercial officers), and the French Trade Bureau (founded in 1906, specializes in investigating business information) all belong to this system. The characteristics of this kind of organization are: first, it can investigate the situation of foreign markets for the reference of domestic merchants; second, it can help merchants solve various trade problems; third, it can dispatch commercial officers and correspondents in various places.</p>
<p>2. Export credit insurance system. The export credit insurance system is a financial facility to promote trade. The British Overseas Trade Act of 1920 and the new export credit insurance system of 1926 are guaranteed by the government and the guarantee bureau to guarantee the payment credit of the buyer's bill of exchange issued by the exporter, and provide guarantee and financial convenience. The main facility of French export trade is also the export credit insurance system, which was implemented in July 1928. Its purpose is also to help domestic export merchants. Germany also adopts this credit guarantee system for exports to Russia.</p>
<p>3. Export subsidy system. This is one of the most common practices in various countries. When a certain export product reaches a certain weight, it is given a certain amount of funds or a tax refund method to treat domestic merchants favorably, such as the British silk tax refund and car tax refund.</p>
<p>4. Protective tariff system. Export subsidies are a tool for domestic merchants to drive away strong enemies, starting with the encouragement of domestic merchants, while protective tariffs are a direct method of excluding competitors.</p>
<p>5. Promotion of various trade auxiliary organizations. Businesses such as banks, insurance, and transportation are necessary facilities to assist export trade.</p>
<p>6. Various organizations that encourage trade, such as commodity display halls and exhibitions, all belong to this category.</p>
<p>Regarding the automatic improvement of merchants, there are also several disasters:</p>
<p>(1) The soundness of the export merchant organization</p>
<p>(2) The abundance of export merchant capital</p>
<p>(3) The improvement of the quality of export commodities</p>
<p>The above are the strategies for developing trade in both the public and private sectors, which have been effectively implemented in various countries. However, we believe that the fundamental plan lies in the joint organization of export merchants, and this joint organization is what is called an export trade association. The export trade association not only promotes the sound organization, sufficient capital, and improved quality of export merchants, but also includes the investigation of overseas markets and the guidance of export trade. The key points of its organization can be discussed separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The export trade association should take export merchants as the main body of the organization. The biggest reason for the failure of China's export trade is the lack of contact organizations. No matter what kind of affairs, they are all governed by their own. Even mutually exclusive. Internally, it is impossible to avoid competition among the same industry, and externally, there is no solidarity to resist foreign insults. As a result, the power of aggression has not yet come, and domestic merchants have long been unable to support this situation. This is not only the case for export merchants, but it is especially important for export business. To seek the position of export commodities in overseas markets, there must be a common and solid organization of domestic export merchants. The composition of this export trade association must take export merchants as the main body.</p>
<p>(2) The export trade association should take promoting direct trade as the biggest goal. Those who talk about China's export trade know that the trade rights of our country have fallen into the hands of foreigners. The so-called international trade is a kind of foreign trade, or a comprador trade. All domestic native products are exported abroad, and are usually handled by foreign firms. Chinese merchants hand over the goods to foreign firms, and they are regarded as having done their best in export trade. Even if the goods are received, whether they are exported or not, they are left to the foreign firms to handle, and they never ask. As a result, trade is completely controlled by foreign firms. Sellers cannot know the situation of foreign markets. In addition to inquiring about and buying news and ordering goods from foreign firms at any time, there is no other way. Silk and tea are the most severely controlled by this kind of control. Although foreign merchants have various privileges to restrict Chinese merchants, Chinese merchants cannot resign from the blame for following the old ways. Several years ago, several merchants established small organizations to directly send goods to the United States for sales. Unfortunately, the organization was too small and the results were minimal. Knowledgeable merchants in China know that this kind of trade is very harmful. In fact, they feel a lack of capital and talent, and the organization is not solid, so they cannot get rid of the scope of trading with foreign firms. Therefore, the establishment of an export trade association should take promoting direct trade as the most important goal, so that the common organization, capital, and courage of export merchants can be strengthened, and specialized talents can also be recruited. It can not only avoid the loss of foreign merchants' oppression, but also strengthen the faith of foreigners. The success of direct trade is by no means difficult. In today's world, countries are trying their best to avoid passive trade and indirect trade, but China's trade is passive and passive, indirect and indirect. Should we not be self-vigilant?</p>
<p>(3) The export trade association should focus on the investigation of overseas markets. The main premise for the development of export trade in European and American countries is the investigation of overseas markets. The demand situation in overseas markets is closely related to commodity exports. Therefore, the main duty of the export trade association is to conduct a thorough investigation of the economic situation, market situation, and special trade issues overseas. The investigation results should be collected and statistically published at any time for the reference of export merchants and domestic industrial and commercial circles. The items that should be carried out are: 1. Investigate the general economic situation; 2. Report the market transactions and demand situation; 3. Collect statistics on production, import and export, harvest, and commodity prices in major markets; 4. Report on changes in tax, new routes, railway transportation rates, telegrams, and postal services; 5. Collect various reports, yearbooks, and trade magazines published by foreign governments.</p>
<p>(4) The export trade association should take improving quality and eliminating malpractices as its responsibility. Poor quality is the most important reason for the failure of international trade. The most criticized aspect of the quality of China's export commodities is the complexity of the quality and the lack of grading. For example, silk and tea have no less than dozens or hundreds of brands, and the regulations for each brand cannot represent a certain quality. There are the same kinds of silk with different brands in two years. This situation is the biggest obstacle to the export of commodities. In addition, sticking to old methods and not knowing how to improve is a shortcoming in quality. In addition, there are malpractices such as adulteration and counterfeiting, such as adding water to cotton. All these malpractices of the export trade association, with the same interests at stake, are very suitable to find ways to improve and eliminate the long-standing malpractices, so as to maintain the credit of commodities in the international market.</p>
<p>(5) The export trade association also pays attention to the research on trade management methods and export technology. Whether trade develops depends on the quality of trade management methods and export technology. China does not pay attention to this kind of management methods and technology, and this is the key to foreign trade. For example, the precise research of export commodities, the procedures for customs declaration and export, the situation of foreign shipping, the methods of foreign insurance, the inspection procedures of export goods, the special habits of overseas markets, the research on overseas sales methods, the contact and remittance methods of overseas financial institutions, etc. are all so-called export technology. This kind of technology cannot be achieved without the precise research of specialized talents. The effect of the research is not limited to one exporter. Therefore, this kind of progress is also what the export trade association must pay attention to.</p>
<p>In short, the organization of export trade associations has long been very effective in European and American countries. Under this kind of trade situation in China, it is a plan that cannot be delayed. It can not only promote the success of direct trade, but also prevent foreign means of consolidation and DumpnigPolicy. For example, the recent reduction in the selling price of Japanese raw silk to seize the American and French markets is a manifestation of the consolidation policy. If Chinese export merchants have a strong and sound organization that can directly sell to foreign countries, then with the natural and artificial beauty of China, why worry about not being able to compete with it? This is why I deeply hope that Chinese export merchants can unite with each other and actively develop abroad.</p>

<p>(First category) Consultation matters. All proposals whose main purpose belongs to the administrative aspects of implementation procedures, are summarized by the group and made into simple reports. It seems that there is no need to go through the general meeting for discussion. In the future, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will consult the competent authority for verification based on the group's separate consultation. The original proposal numbers are as follows: 15, 28, 29, 19, 5, 14, 4, 4, 62, 63, 38, 39, (Second category) Abolition of Likin. All proposals belonging to the statement of Likin malpractices belong to this category. However, the abolition of Likin has already been clearly ordered by the National Government to be implemented on a regular basis. In principle, there is no need for discussion. The group believes that it is only necessary to make a simple report of this desire to abolish Likin, and request the meeting to forward it to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to inform the National Government to implement it as soon as possible. The original proposal numbers are as follows: 59, 64, 271, 30, 34, 37. The second group will continue to meet tomorrow. Meetings were held in the morning and afternoon of the 2nd to review. As a result, the group's 31 proposals on international trade and transportation were divided into three categories for review.

<p>Nanjing, 2nd Telegram. The fifth group had review meetings in the morning and afternoon today. The morning was a full review meeting, and the afternoon was a subcommittee review meeting. Now I have found the subcommittee review meeting report and recorded the original case. A. Basic Industry Group, (1) Review of the report on the proposal to reward basic industries. It is found that there are a total of 50 proposals in the fifth group, divided into six categories: 20 proposals in the first category, 18 proposals in the second category, 18 proposals in the third category, proposals in the fourth category, 3 proposals in the fifth category, and 7 proposals in the sixth category.

Determine the sales channels for steel, and the government should order all agencies in the country to give priority to purchasing domestic goods, D. Stipulate protective tariffs and preferential freight rates, E. Restrict iron sand, scrap iron, and metal raw materials needed for steel smelting, B. What group does the review report of the fourth proposal belong to? Not detailed. (1) According to the various factories and arsenals in the country mentioned in this proposal, the daily demand for steel is already more than 15 tons. Since the sales channels have been determined, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce should consult with the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs to prepare. C. What group does the review report belong to? Not detailed. (1) Please the government order the fuel research agency to conduct research on oil production from inferior coal. At the same time, the Guangdong Provincial Government should conduct its own research nearby. After results are achieved, prepare again. D. The basic industry and industrial raw materials will be combined for review, divided into five major parts: (1) Policies to reward basic industries, (2) Coal, iron, and steel, (3) Acids, alkalis, and salts, (4) Sugar, paper, and rayon, (5) Machinery. E. What group does the combined review report of the first, thirteenth, and fourteenth proposals belong to? Not detailed. It is found that the content of these three proposals is consistent, but there is a distinction between simple and sufficient. The reasons are very sufficient. The sections mentioned in the first proposal are more detailed and should be based on this proposal. Please the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to consider and implement it. F. What group does the combined review report of the fifth and sixty-eighth proposals belong to? Not detailed. It is found that in the first method in the fifth proposal, the meaning is unclear, and it is feared that it will affect the original loan. In the second method, the chief engineer and chief accountant have the right to be recommended by investors, which is not in our hands. It seems inappropriate. Other technical and accounting personnel can be recommended by the chief engineer and chief accountant, and the right to use them all will inevitably be in the hands of others, which is even more inappropriate. In the third method, the addition of gold for early repayment has not been specified. It is also inappropriate. According to the above and other reasons, it is proposed to adopt the sixty-sixth proposal for combined discussion. Is it appropriate? Please decide publicly. G. What group does the combined review report of the seventeenth and fortieth proposals belong to? Not detailed. It is found that the sections mentioned in the seventeenth proposal are quite insightful. The Academia Sinica and the Industrial Testing Institute of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce have long been established. However, the members of the provinces and cities still need the shadow (photographed by Nanjing Guanghua)</p>
<p>Expand gradually to comfort the desires of the original proposers. It can be said that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is proceeding quickly. Also, the main purpose of the fortieth proposal is to request the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to encourage various domestic industries to set up their own research institutions as the key plan. Now, those with aspirations in the Shanghai industrial and commercial circles have already established this kind of research institute. This proposal should be passed twice, and the ministry should consider it. However, it is feared that it will be difficult to handle the funding in practice. As for the research results, the ministry should give separate rewards.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Speech by Hu Mai, Representative of the Executive Yuan <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Hu Mai, representative of the Executive Yuan, said briefly, "Now, the industry and commerce of various countries in the world are developing rapidly. Looking back at the industry and commerce of our country, we are lagging behind by not a small margin. Moreover, years of internal strife have made everything incomparable to others. Now, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is convening a National Industrial and Commercial Conference, which coincides with the time of the suppression of the rebellion. It is a good time for our country's industry and commerce to seek development. I sincerely hope that the colleagues of the Industrial and Commercial Conference will express their opinions and deliberate on the general outline of industrial and commercial development in this conference, so that the whole country can follow it for implementation. Hu Mai, on behalf of the Executive Yuan, expresses his infinite congratulations."</p>
<h3 id="e128">Speech by Member Yang Xingfo <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yang Xingfo briefly said, "The Industrial and Commercial Conference can be called the Industrial and Commercial Group Conference of the National Conference. The National Government has already held group meetings for education, Mongolian and Tibetan affairs, internal affairs, finance, etc. ㈠ We represent the people and come here, not a joint meeting of various industries. We should not argue based on the interests of various industries. We should start from the perspective of the national economy to solve the current industrial and commercial promotion methods. ㈡ Members cannot be fully satisfied before the meeting, leading to disappointment after the meeting. Some people regard the meeting as omnipotent, and use the meeting to resolve matters that cannot be resolved. In fact, it is not. On the one hand, the government must vigorously implement its resolutions, but members should not expect too much. The realization of the plan cannot be realized by government orders alone. It must be brought to the community and earnestly implemented by all of you present to truly realize the spirit of the meeting."</p>
<h3 id="e129">Speech by Guest Chen Yi <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Chen Yi said in his speech that he had about two points of thought: ㈠ The timing of the meeting is excellent. Today's meeting coincides with the aftermath of the suppression of the rebellion. ㈡ The development of industry and commerce must rely on psychological stability. In the future, we can use the meaning of stability to achieve the development of economy and industry and commerce.</p>

If it were a matter of time, it could have been closed, but members from remote provinces who may not have been able to mail them in advance due to inconvenient transportation are still accepted.

<p>Hu Shuhua has specific suggestions for developing industry, etc.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd. Hu Shuhua, chairman of the first group review, hopes that this conference can have specific and practical plans for developing domestic industry, resisting foreign goods, and relieving unemployment, and suggests that the ministry actively implement them. The group's afternoon meeting on the 2nd failed to take place and will continue at 8:30 AM on the 3rd. The entire case of the group was originally divided into six groups according to nature. Now, the two groups of basic industry and industrial raw materials are fully merged for review, and divided into five major categories. The review report has been detailed.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Zhang Xinwu Talks <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The materials for this session's proposals are richer than ever before</p>
<p>However, all industrial and commercial undertakings end with economics.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd. Member Zhang Xinwu said that the richness of the materials for the proposals from all parties at this session is unprecedented and sufficient for long-term research. However, no matter how industry and commerce are created, promoted, and improved, they all end with economics. If the national economy and the national economy can find a way, all plans can be implemented. Therefore, this conference should pay special attention to the national economic construction problem and seek a satisfactory solution, so that the Principle of People's Livelihood can be implemented after a certain period of time, then the conference will not be in vain.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Various Aspects of the General Assembly <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Negotiations for Interviews by Reporters from Beijing and Shanghai</p>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd. In the afternoon of the 2nd, reporters from various newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai went to the Industrial and Commercial Conference to interview for news and obtained the consent of Hu Shuhua, chairman of the fifth review group, to copy the review results of the group. Suddenly, Xu Shanxiang, a technical supervisor of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, sternly forbade the reporters from copying and snatched the copied manuscript from the reporters' hands, saying that it should not be published, making Hu Shuhua and the reporters embarrassed. The reporters felt that copying news after the meeting and with the chairman's consent did not hinder order and the procedures were not in violation. While they were stating their reasons, a staff member of the conference, Xiong, and others followed Xu's instructions and became increasingly angry. The reporters, unable to reason, gathered at the Central Hotel to hold a meeting and decided that the news of the Industrial and Commercial Conference was important and they would continue to interview together and submit Xu Shanxiang for public discussion by the reporters' union.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Cases Submitted for Review Today <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>

<h3 id="e141">A Glimpse of the Proposals <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Proposal from the Shanghai Cosmetics Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cosmetics Industry Association, in view of the impact of imported goods on the industry in recent years, and the soaring raw material prices due to the rise in gold prices, and the slump in business, especially proposed to the National Industrial and Commercial Conference, requesting the government to exempt raw material tax and domestic product tax to reduce costs, increase import taxes on finished goods and maintain domestic goods. The original text is as follows: It is for suggestion, I respectfully read Dr. Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan, which says that there are three major wars, one is international war, the second is commercial war, and the third is class war. For us who are in business, commercial war has no ethnic distinction or national boundary limitation. Since the European War, foreign goods have become more and more abundant in our country. The imperialists have changed their military war to commercial war. The people in the market do not understand the advantages and disadvantages, and selling foreign goods is no different from helping the tiger to abuse, causing the domestic production to decline and they then monopolize the market. Their methods are cruel, and the losses to our people are no less than the iron and blood war with strong oppression. Take the cosmetics industry as an example. The import of imported goods has exceeded 4.3 million, and the production of domestic goods is less than one-tenth, the annual outflow of rights and interests is unbearable. Thinking of this, it is really regrettable that the association cannot keep silent. Therefore, there is a proposal to exempt raw material tax and domestic product tax to reduce costs, increase import taxes on finished goods and maintain domestic goods. I have inquired about the raw materials needed by the industry, in addition to domestic ones, such as Essenticloilg pure essential oil and Suthetic Chemical containing fragrance, medicinal compound Oils mixed essential raw materials, there are three types that must rely on foreign countries. It is because our country's civilization has degenerated and science is backward. It is not that the industry enjoys using foreign goods. The import tax on the above three categories is 17.5%, which is 5% higher than the export tax of European and American countries. The authorities regard the import of foreign goods as a good intention to prohibit them, but we must know that our country still lacks the possibility of producing the above three categories of raw materials, and there are no substitutes. In recent years, the rise in gold prices has affected the industry even more. Larger factories can barely maintain, and smaller factories are closed at any time. If we do not remedy this for a long time, we will all perish. At this critical moment, how can we sit and wait for death? Therefore, we request the authorities to exempt all raw material taxes that the industry needs and has to rely on foreign countries. It can be hoped that the cost of domestic production will be lighter and it will be easier to promote. At the same time, we still need to implore the authorities to vigorously maintain and exempt domestic product tax and increase import taxes on finished goods, which is enough to promote and gradually develop. Otherwise, the raw materials are taxed first, and the products are taxed later, and all costs have exceeded those of imported goods. Hoping that it can sell well and compete with foreign goods is like climbing a tree to catch fish. The association believes that cosmetics in European and American countries can be recognized as daily necessities, and domestic cosmetics are in the infancy stage. The exemption of raw material tax and domestic product tax and the increase of import taxes on finished goods are necessary to support them. I dare to state the various sections to save the cosmetics industry, which is the only key to commercial warfare. As far as I can see, I respectfully contribute my opinions. I am waiting for the public decision. Suggested by Shanghai Cosmetics Industry Association, Chairman Ma Sheng, duty committee member Mou Yueqiu, Li Heyun, Zhang Shuliang</p>

<p>—Hai Ke</p>
<p>Man—My dear, please believe me, I only love you. If my body is not by your side, I will miss you all the time. Those jet-black eyes and cloud-like hair.</p>
<p>Woman—Enough, enough, you are used to saying flattering words, I know you will say the same to other lovers.</p>
<p>Man—I only say these words to you, because my other lover is American, she has blue eyes and blonde hair.</p>
<p>A—You look happy today. Why are you so happy?</p>
<p>B—I dropped a full-page (newspaper size) in the downtown area and couldn't find it after searching everywhere.</p>
<p>A—Then you lost a full-page for nothing. What's there to be happy about?</p>
<p>B—But I couldn't find that full-page, but I found a big silver dollar.</p>
<p>A—I was extremely angry today. I almost burst my stomach with anger.</p>
<p>B—What happened?</p>
<p>A—Old Bing next door is preparing to entertain guests and wants to borrow the carpet in my living room. For the sake of good neighborliness, I generously lent it to him. Who knew that after a while, he brought it back, saying that the pattern was not good and the goods were too old to be laid on the ground and did not match their furniture. He wants me to lend them one hundred yuan to buy a new carpet.</p>
<p>Master (asking his servant)—Ah San, did you see a five-yuan bill on the ground when you swept the floor today?</p>
<p>Servant—Thank you, master. I have already put it away.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Three Oddities in Hangzhou <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>—Yan Ye</p>
<p>Someone came from Hangzhou and said that three odd things have happened in the area recently. Odd things are enough to talk about and help, so I hurriedly recorded them and paid them for this talk.</p>
<p>Sun, a villager near Tianmu Mountain, was casually looking at the riverbank one evening when he saw a turtle coming ashore from the water. Its head resembled that of an eagle. He was surprised and quickly captured it. When he looked at it closely under the light at home, its mouth was sharp and curved downwards, and its eyes were piercing, just like an eagle's head. The shell was as black as lacquer and could reflect light. Other feet, tail, and back patterns were no different from ordinary turtles. Sun regarded it as a treasure and took care of it carefully. The next morning at dawn, there was a crying sound in the room. At first, he was shocked by where the sound came from, and then he realized that the sound came from the turtle. He sneaked over to listen to it, and it was the turtle crowing, which was even more surprising. The news spread far and wide, and everyone came to watch. A certain antique shop owner in Hangzhou recently bought it at a high price and treated it as an antique. People from Hangzhou came to ask for a viewing, and the door was like a market. Everyone sighed that it was a strange thing in the world. I wrote a tortoise essay last month and published it in this talk. All the tortoises mentioned are rare tortoises. Now that I have this tortoise, I feel that what I said before is not strange enough.</p>
<p>In Hangzhou two months ago, a 64-year-old woman married a Yang man who was about 40 years old. For a time, the society laughed. Recently, there has been a strange story of a 60-year-old woman giving birth to a child. The woman lives in a certain town not far from Hangzhou. Her husband is already in his twilight years. The family is wealthy, but the door is weak and thin, and only two old people depend on each other. The couple has been living together for forty years without a single birth of a son or daughter, so the two old people are worried about the fact that there is no child to inherit. Unexpectedly, something very strange happened. Last winter, the woman suddenly became pregnant. This spring, her belly gradually bulged, and the two old people suspected it was a disease. After visiting many doctors, they all said that this pregnancy was gratifying. The two old people were dubious, surprised and happy. From summer to autumn, her belly was like a five-stone gourd. A few days ago, she gave birth. At the first cry, she was a boy. The withered Poplar produced a ladder, and a lineage was passed down. The old woman was so happy that she did not feel the pain after childbirth. The old man was even more excited and smiled. On the third day, he held a grand banquet and held a Tangbing feast. Relatives and friends all marveled at the strange thing and were very happy. The only unhappy person was a certain Jia in the clan who was scheduled to inherit the two old people.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Antiquities Preservation Association in Hubin collects antiquities, which are all rare treasures. Recently, two plum blossoms have been obtained. They are ancient and elegant. In this autumn, the East Fence is still blooming, but these two plum blossoms are catching up and competing with each other. They wither after the cold, and do not fight with pine and bamboo. They bloom before the end of winter and are like chrysanthemums proudly blooming in autumn. They are strange. The plum blossoms are not very tall, with more than ten colors, ancient and clean, elegant and lovely. The people in Hangzhou all sighed that they were blessed.</p>
<h3 id="e144">German Insect Market <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>The system of markets has been passed down from ancient times. It is still prevalent in Europe. The Nottingham goose market and the broom and fur markets in other places are numerous and famous. However, they are not as lively and interesting as the insect market held in Frankfurt, Germany. This city has a regular schedule every year. When the time comes, insect enthusiasts from all over the world come from afar to select and purchase good species, and they do not hesitate to pay even higher prices than usual. The items displayed in the market include butterflies, moths, beetles, flies, grasshoppers, crickets, and other grass insects of all kinds. They are categorized for customers to choose from. However, there are also some peddlers who do not have samples on-site but use a fixed-term delivery method. Their insect sales rely solely on verbal contact. Customers only need to specify the type, and they can make a reservation, just like American itinerant livestock traders whose goods are shipped from thousands of miles away. These people are very familiar with the names of rare insects and where to find them. If there is a demand during the market period and the insect has not yet emerged, they can also issue a guarantee to the buyer and deliver it on schedule. The trade of insects is so prosperous. This is something that those who love novelty should know.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Trivial Talks While Holding Crabs <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Meiqu</p>
<p>On Wednesday (October 29th) afternoon, the dark clouds hung heavy and the rain beat fiercely on the tiles. I sat idly in the west chamber, struggling to compose a verse ending with "In the human calamity, the world is turned upside down; in the heavens, the wind still blows off hats." Suddenly, I heard the sound of a bell, and Mr. Xu Jianfu invited me to Qingfeng Mingyue Lodge for a crab-eating and wine-drinking pleasure. I braved the wind and rain and drove there. The wine was strong and the crabs were plump. The trivial talks were all noteworthy, as recorded below.</p>
<p>Rare Coincidence: Jianfu greeted me warmly. Entering the room, we laughed and chatted. I counted on my fingers that Jianfu's and his wife's birthdays were approaching, and I planned a drinking celebration. His wife said, "Birthday feasting is meaningless." Then she pointed to her sister-in-law and her adopted daughter, saying that these two did not know the month and day of their birth. It turned out that Madam Xu was kidnapped by bandits when she was young, and her adopted daughter was an abandoned infant. Her father was a famous scholar who only knew how to mourn his deceased wife and no longer remembered the date of his beloved daughter's birth. I said, "Truly, there is a rare coincidence."</p>
<p>Quick Words from a Quick Mind: Once the crabs were on the plate, some were pointed and some were round. Everyone chose their favorite. Some ate the crab shell first and then held the claws, while others nibbled at the eight legs, saving the crab shell for last. Shen Gongshijia carefully picked and scraped the crab. Madam Xu laughed at him, saying, "If you are so meticulous, why not just swallow it whole for a quick pleasure?" Everyone laughed loudly. Seeing Madam Xu in front of the wine cup, she chewed and spat out the shell and meat of the eight legs and two claws, no less than Wu Yanghou's wild eating style. Such a quick-witted person is bound to have such quick words.</p>
<p>The Reputation of the Altar is High: Zhong Ziji arrived late. He picked up the remaining crab and discarded the crab shell, only eating the legs. It turned out that he had a peculiar fondness for sheep dates. I said, "In such wind and rain, where have you been traveling? Are you going to repeat the mistake of Fangfeng?" Ziji ate and replied, "Your words are about to be announced to you. My teacher, Jianfu, served as an official and educator in Guangdong for many years. After returning to Shanghai, his fame attracted eager students from home and abroad who competed to join his school. Later, he followed the public's opinion and advertised widely in the newspaper, reaching as many as three thousand. In recent years, he has become more selective and no longer accepts students, which makes those who secretly admire him feel disappointed. I, Feng Ruomei, Chen Jianzi, and others, especially feel the transforming power of timely rain and pity those who yearn outside the walls of the school. We ask for the revival of the altar. Today, we are working with fellow students to establish bylaws and discuss organizational laws, which is not comparable to the Fangfeng clan." I noted that Jianfu had many disciples. These few had already entered the hall and ascended the room, making a name for themselves in the art world. Recently, among the female disciples, sisters such as Tuo Fa Hua and Yu Yun, I treat them as respected friends, which shows that the reputation of the altar is high.</p>
<p>Not a Shallow Revival: As the wine waned and people grew drunk, the two Madams served the guests ginger juice mixed with sugar and crushed ice. Jianfu leaned on his wife's shoulder and whispered privately. His wife shook her head repeatedly, smiling but not speaking. I happened to see it, and Jianfu said, "Don't laugh, we old couple are already middle-aged, so it doesn't hurt to flirt in front of guests." I said, "The old man's revival is not shallow. Are you not afraid of the ghost of the gutless fellow?" Just as his wife was about to reply, Ziji suddenly came from the back room and said to me, "My teacher has newly established rules for enrolling students. Please spread the word far and wide that anyone who attaches a one-cent stamp can request detailed information from Qingfeng Mingyue Lodge." After saying this, he left immediately, without hearing our banter. His sincerity was like this.</p>

<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The night before last, the wind and rain were raging. I was feeling depressed and had no way to relieve myself, so I lay on the couch to rest. Suddenly, two burly men unexpectedly came upstairs and entered my room directly, shouting for the servant to come. I was very surprised. The burly men, seeing me, also loudly ordered me to come downstairs. I couldn't understand why and scolded them. Then several more people came up the stairs, rolling up their sleeves to help the abuse. I realized that they were bandits. My weak strength was no match for their fists, so I could only submit and obey their orders. They drove my wife and me to the side room downstairs. At that time, the men and women living together had already been forced to sit in a row. The bandits stood at the door, holding guns and facing each other, ordering us men to face the wall and not look. The other bandits went upstairs again, overturning chests and boxes, plundering at will. The servant was timid and, seeing the guns, trembled and collapsed on the couch. The bandits mistakenly thought she had something precious hidden and searched repeatedly, obtaining two silver coins and a gold ring on her hand, which they snatched away. What was most interesting was that the bandits demanded gold, silver, and jewelry from the women living together. The women didn't understand their language and, in a panic, took a Western-style tie hanging on the beam and gave it to the bandits. The bandits were furious. A maid wore a gold ring, and the bandits took it away. The maid begged and kowtowed to them countless times. The bandits were unexpectedly moved and returned it. It was truly rare for robbers to have compassion. Then the bandits shouted and left. The residents all suffered losses. I checked briefly and found that, in addition to some scattered ornaments and silver coins, I had lost a large leather suitcase, which contained the servant's clothes. It turned out that the neighbors had been careless a few days ago, so the servant had specially placed the more valuable ornaments in a large leather suitcase to prevent accidents and make it easier to carry. Now it had been looted by the bandits, which was completely unexpected. Other broken books and incomplete drafts were my treasures, but they did not attract the bandits' attention and remained untouched, so my joy and comfort can be imagined. As a beggar of literature, I was honored by the visit of the noble robbers. A smile.</p>

<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>I am based in Shanghai, toiling over documents. I have a fondness for drama, but I have no time to study it. Recently, I was impressed by the art of Xue Yanqin, a famous female impersonator on the Tiansheng Stage. I thought of feasting my eyes. So, on the evening of October 25th, I took my relatives to watch. At that time, Yanqin was performing the full version of her signature piece, "Yutang Chun." Yanqin herself played Su San, paired with Mr. Zhao Yu's Wang Gongzi. Their performance was very wonderful. The lingering love in the brothel and temple, and the righteousness in giving money. The most wonderful part was the scene where Su San was deceived and wronged, and the yamen runners escorted her. The allegro performance was vivid and moving, like the cry of a crane in the middle of the night, making people weep. When she was tried in the three halls, a strand of fragrant heart contained resentment and pleaded her case. Her singing was even more outstanding. The audience's spirits were lifted, and the whole audience applauded continuously. Watching the whole play, from the brothel to the grand reunion, there was no flaw. Her great reputation truly lived up to her name. Returning home, I wrote this down.</p>
<p>Acknowledgement and Introduction: Mr. Wang Daren, a famous amateur performer from the sea, has been studying cosmetics for many years. He has a Daren Company in Zhoupu Town. Recently, based on his experience, he invented a kind of "Celebrity Cream." It has a fragrant scent and is as clear as snow. It is wonderful to apply it to the face. Yesterday, I received two bottles as a gift, so I would like to express my gratitude and introduce it to everyone.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Warmth in the Heart (307) <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Fifteen: Tears Fall in All Directions, Sorrowful Red Feelings; All Hearts are Captivated, Lingering Green Intentions</p>
<p>Zuo Shichen said, "So you're shedding tears too?" Cuiyun said, "I'm not. I'm lying, my little handkerchief is soaked through three times. First, Lianxiang was my good little sister. I didn't even go to mourn her when she died. Now, the Hong Lianxiang on the stage is the real Hong Lianxiang. Seeing such a gentle and beautiful woman being ruined alive by others, those tears are shed for her. Second, my own life is similar to Lianxiang's. I wanted to die several times. It's hateful that I don't have Lianxiang's determination. Now I think about it, it would be good to die. People would pity her and shed tears of sympathy. We who don't die are truly living a life of torment and suffering." Cuiyun had originally washed her face and was drawing an eyebrow with a pencil in front of the large mirror. Next to her was a large sofa chair. Saying that, it seemed as if she had no strength, so she lay down on the sofa and buried her face in the armrest. Only her shoulders were seen rising and falling, which startled everyone in the room. Zuo Shichen had just washed his hands. Suddenly hearing her stop speaking, he turned around and saw this situation. He said, "Eh? What's wrong?" He quickly came over and turned her shoulder, saying, "It's all my fault. I shouldn't have let you keep talking, keep talking, and reveal your own sadness. Look, your face, which you just washed, is tear-stained again. The others are really waiting anxiously for your turn to sing." He hurriedly called for someone in the room to bring more hot water to wash her face. Cuiyun only sighed a few times and washed her face again. When she left, she repeatedly told Zuo Shichen not to go, but to wait for her to come back. "One or two turns to sing is very quick. I haven't finished telling you about Hong Lianxiang." Zuo Shichen knew that this was a lie. The person was already dead, and the facts were gone. The play was already the aftermath. What else was there to say? However, he felt very uneasy because this conversation had inadvertently revealed her sadness. Fortunately, she didn't have many turns to sing, and she came back in a moment. He could also comfort her. The meaning of life is just like this. If you see everything clearly, you can save a lot of trouble. However, those words are just empty words. How can they resolve the heart of a courtesan who is drifting in the world and infatuated with vain glory? Sure enough, in a short while, Cuiyun came back. She was still as happy and talkative as before. She said that it was not good to eat crabs without eating rice, so let's order some dishes to eat. Zuo Shichen said, "I can't eat rice. Let's buy some porridge to eat." Cuiyun ordered someone to prepare some side dishes for eating with porridge. Zuo Shichen asked her, "You just said you had something to say about Hong Lianxiang. What was it?" Cuiyun said, "That was just to trick you. What else is there to say? After that play, the Yin family spent some money and didn't perform it anymore. Hong Lianxiang's coffin was buried in a piece of land in the countryside of Suzhou. I'm afraid the green grass is already full of it."</p>

<h3 id="e149">Finance: The Gold Market Experienced Frequent Turmoil Last Week <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Jewish Merchants' Bullish Positions Surged, Reaching Approximately Seven or Eight Thousand Contracts</p>
<p>Small-Sized Short-Term Gold Bars Saw Premiums of Thirteen to Fourteen Taels</p>
<p>As the Autumn Racing Season Approached, Bull and Bear Positions Were Squaring Off, Resulting in Sideways Trading</p>
<p>The silver market, foreign exchange restrictions, and banknotes all saw rising trends. Last week, the state of the gold market was one of sideways trading, with alternating rises and falls and aimless fluctuations. In particular, the industry lacked firm resolve, mainly due to the mutual control exerted by both bull and bear factions. While the silver market and foreign exchange saw slight increases, the gold market ultimately weakened. There were slight shifts from the beginning of the week, but the daily difference reached as high as seven or eight taels. Large bullish positions emerged from Xinheng, the Luo brothers, and others, but signs of weakness were soon revealed, and there seemed to be a potential stabilization towards the weekend, with a difference of four or five taels. Looking back, from Tuesday morning, active sellers suddenly drove the price down to 579 taels. By the next day, due to large players such as Yuansheng and arbitrageurs covering short positions, the price briefly broke through the 590 taels mark, reaching 90 taels and 0.02 yuan. Later, the market became unpredictable and chaotic, with frequent turmoil. Until Saturday, the result was a decline of 2.6 taels compared to the previous Saturday. However, there was also a fluctuation of 11.2 taels during the week. The overall rise in the price of large silver bars was 0.0625, with a range of 0.125. The price of American silver rose 0.125, fluctuating by 0.025 in both directions, while the forward rate rose slightly by half a point, totaling 0.125. The Japanese exchange rate fell by a total of 0.75. The price of bank transactions also loosened, with the forward rate diverging from the spot rate by about 20 taels. It is observed that, as the Southwest Autumn Racing Season approaches, there may be no major changes in the gold market. The general situation over the past week is described in detail below:</p>
<p>Fluctuations of 11 Taels Over the Entire Week: On Monday (October 27), the price of large silver bars contracted, and the exchange rate remained unchanged. The domestic market seemed firm, but Jewish merchants Qiao Rifu and others were selling forward sterling, and the opening gold price was low, at 584.9 taels. Later, due to purchases by Fuchang Yuanheng, Yuanxing Yong, Dadecheng, and others, it reached 87.9 taels. Then, Yuancheng, Jinan, Yu Da, and others tended to sell, suppressing the price by three or four taels. After a flat opening in the afternoon, the market weakened, and the result was 81.7 yuan, a decrease of four taels compared to the previous Saturday. This was due to heavy selling by large players, with a total of about seven or eight thousand short contracts. The next day, the gold market showed improvement. Although the price of large silver bars did not change, the price of silver rose slightly, and the exchange rate trended upwards. Large players squared off positions, and the gold price increased due to bullish leverage. However, the price briefly broke through 80 taels in the morning due to Yu Da, Yuanxing Yong, and others tending to sell. However, large players resumed buying shortly after, and the price turned upwards, reaching 88.7 taels in the afternoon before falling back by three taels. The closing price was 83.5 taels, a decrease of 2.3 taels compared to the previous day. On Wednesday morning, the price increased again. Although the price of large silver bars increased, news of Citibank tending to sell came out, and people's hearts turned upward. There were large players chasing purchases, and the exchange rate was also favorable, soaring to 90.02 taels. Active sellers appeared in the afternoon, and the price fell back by five or six taels. The closing price was 83.5 taels, a decrease of 2.3 taels compared to the previous day. The next day, the silver market did not change, but the exchange rate loosened, and the gold price seemed to weaken, hovering around 84 taels. On Friday, the price of large silver bars did not change, the price of silver rose slightly, and the forward rate rose by half a point. However, the domestic market was flat, with the gold price fluctuating by only four taels, trading little, and fluctuating between 85 taels and 81 taels. On Saturday morning, the price of large silver bars increased, fortunately with good support. The American sale caused the gold market to open high. Then, due to the rush of various firms, it reached 87 taels. Later, sellers became prevalent, and as the Western merchants' autumn racing season next Monday approached, bull and bear positions were largely squared off, so there was only a fluctuation of four taels. However, the market continued to trade sideways, and in the afternoon, it was only at 83.1 yuan, a decrease of 1.1 yuan compared to the previous day. As for the spot price of small-sized gold bars, it seemed to be small, with the short-term price increasing by about thirteen or fourteen taels. However, sales were brisk. The high and low prices for the British, American, and Indian silver markets and foreign exchange prices are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e153">Securities: The Bond Market Remained Quiet and Stable Last Week <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Bond Prices Saw Slight Increases, with an Extremely Peaceful Trend</p>
<p>Market Conditions Were Dull, with Trading of Over 30 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Last week, trading in the bond market was scattered, and market conditions were relatively quiet. The trading volume was low as major buyers and sellers remained on the sidelines during the period around the month-end settlement. Excluding Thursday, when the market was closed for settlement, the trading volume was approximately 9.5 million yuan on Friday, 8.5 million yuan on Monday, and approximately 6 million yuan on Wednesday and the weekend. On Tuesday, as the October contracts had expired and the December contracts had not yet opened, only the November contracts were trading, with a volume of approximately 3.5 million yuan. The total trading volume was 33.87 million yuan, a decrease of over 14 million yuan compared to the previous week. The market was muted because it was the month-end settlement period, and the bond market environment was sluggish. People remained cautious, and there was more reverse arbitrage. Therefore, demand and supply were balanced, and bond prices were sluggish, with minimal daily fluctuations. For example, the price of the 19 Series bonds only increased by one yuan and several jiao on Monday. After that, the price fluctuated by only a few jiao each day. The rally was stronger for both demobilization bonds on Monday and Friday, while the remaining days were stable. The 19 Customs bonds rose by one yuan and several jiao on Friday alone, while the remaining days were sluggish. The 96 bonds gradually loosened in recent weeks, but on Friday, demand temporarily exceeded supply, and the price rose by approximately two yuan at most. Other bonds remained sluggish as before, with no slight changes. The results were slight increases overall. A statistical table of the high, low, and fluctuations of each bond over the past week is listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>The Market Process Showed Prosperity and Then Decline</p>
<p>The Current Demand Was Sluggish</p>
<p>Last week, the silk market initially rose due to the upward trend in the American cotton market and the sharp increase in raw cotton prices. The sentiment was good, and the prices of the first and second grades rose slightly. Before long, due to sluggish actual sales, various groups lacked vitality, and the inventory of 20-count Five Blessings Mutton yarn was too large, and the price did not move. The Chaozhou group's short positions remained unchanged, and their attitude was calm. As a result, the market situation took a sharp turn downwards. At the end of the week, American cotton prices fell back, causing morale to scatter. The prices of various monthly marks increased by one or two taels to five or six jiao in the near term compared to the previous week. The total trading volume for the week was 90,850 bales. The spot yarn transactions of the guest group were particularly deserted. The amount of yarn purchased by each group totaled 8,026 bales, and the market was weak. The amounts purchased by each group are listed below:</p>
<p>Group	Bales	Group	Bales	Group	Bales</p>
<p>Sichuan	2,155	Guangdong	1,745	Inland	850</p>

<p>The Weekend Slightly Shifted to Mildness</p>
<p>Current Cotton Demand Not Yet Smooth</p>
<p>The cotton market's situation at the beginning of last week was firm, with an unstoppable upward momentum. This was because American cotton prices had risen, with each increase reaching one corner and one fen outside the customs. As a result, people's hearts soared, and the Ningbo and Japanese merchants purchased vigorously. The market surged, and prices in various local areas were high and supplies were not abundant. Hankou was affected by the Shanghai market, rising by one or two taels with this news. In the market, there were only buyers and a lack of sellers. Standard cotton once reached a high of 30 taels, eight or nine qian. Over the weekend, American cotton fell by thirty to forty points, and at the same time, the Ningbo bulls settled their positions, and the market shifted to mildness. As a result, the prices of standard cotton for each month were five or six qian higher than last week. The total transaction volume for the entire week was 363,800 piculs. The sales of spot cotton in the market have not been very smooth. The source calculations include 12,070 bales of Yao cotton and 2,401 bales of Tong cotton. Various factories purchased 34,885 piculs, and trading firms took in 5,040 piculs. American cotton was similar to the previous week. The amounts purchased by various factories and trading firms are recorded below:</p>
<p>Factory Purchases  Highest Price  Lowest Price  Transaction Volume  Term</p>
<p>Ping Jia Er  30.00  :::  300 pieces  Spot goods delivered to the factory</p>

<h3 id="e157">The State of the World Cotton Industry in the Last Ten Years <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Decline in Europe and America, Progress in Asia</p>
<p>Since the end of the European War, the cotton spinning industry in various countries around the world has rapidly progressed. Recently, the general decline in world prices has presented a trend of overproduction, which has become increasingly evident recently, especially in Europe and America. Asia, on the other hand, has relatively progressed. The following is a table of the world's spinning machines and raw cotton consumption statistics for the last ten years (unit: thousands):</p>
<p>Year  Spinning Spindles  Looms  Average Consumption per Thousand Spindles  Cotton  American Cotton (bales)</p>
<p>1913  144,615  2,857  23,000  156</p>
<p>1921  152,317  2,810  17,595  116</p>
<p>1922  154,555  2,831  21,167  137</p>
<p>1923  156,353  2,922  22,143  141</p>
<p>1924  158,462  3,086  20,430  128</p>
<p>1925  161,363  3,111  23,294  144</p>
<p>1926  163,723  3,184  24,681  151</p>
<p>1927  164,597  3,243  25,881  157</p>
<p>1928  165,102  3,278  25,540  155</p>
<p>1929  164,211  3,115  25,882  158</p>
<p>1930  164,120  3,000  25,209  153</p>
<p>Observing the above table, the number of spinning spindles in 1930 was less than in 1927, which shows the declining trend of the cotton spinning industry. It is found that the total number decreased by only 91,000 spindles this year compared to last year, of which Europe decreased by 400,500 spindles and America decreased by 720,000 spindles. However, Asia increased by 972,000 spindles, and other regions also increased by 62,000 spindles, which shows the prevalence of the decline in the European and American spinning industries. Due to various reasons, Asia has made progress. Among them, India increased by 198,000 spindles, Japan increased by 542,000 spindles, and China increased by 227,000 spindles. However, since March, the surge of revolutionary sentiment in India has reduced the work in cotton mills. Japan, due to the lifting of the gold ban and the rise in gold prices, has presented a state of economic recession. Only China, with a decrease in the import of foreign goods, has a relatively good working situation.</p>
<p>The consumption of raw cotton has also decreased due to the unfavorable trade of cotton products. Among them, the decrease in American cotton is particularly large. Other cottons, such as Indian cotton, have seen an increase. The main reason for the consumption of American cotton is that the cotton industry in the Americas is in the most obvious state of decline, and the increase in low-grade products has led to a tendency to substitute cheaper Indian cotton. The efforts of other regions to plant cotton are also sufficient to reduce the use of American cotton. The following is a table of the consumption of various cottons in the last ten years (unit: thousands of 500-pound bales):</p>
<p>Year  Total  American Cotton  Indian Cotton  Egyptian Cotton  Other</p>
<p>1920  23,000  14,630  3,977  946  3,447</p>
<p>1921  17,595  10,030  4,399  509  2,557</p>
<p>1922  21,167  12,757  5,192  748  2,736</p>
<p>1923  22,143  12,666  5,402  898  3,177</p>
<p>1924  20,430  11,107  5,409  1,028  2,887</p>
<p>1925  23,294  13,256  5,521  970  2,547</p>
<p>1926  24,681  13,731  5,512  921  4,518</p>
<p>1927  25,881  15,780  5,196  1,005  3,900</p>
<p>1928  25,540  15,407  4,523  956  4,654</p>
<p>1929  25,882  15,076  5,178  989  4,139</p>
<p>1930  25,208  12,023  6,087  937  5,162</p>
<p>The consumption of American cotton in 1930 was very pessimistic, being the lowest figure since 1924. The high consumption of Indian cotton was unprecedented, and the consumption of other cottons was also optimistic. The increased use of domestically grown cotton in China and Russia and the expansion of cotton planting in various countries have resulted in the declining trend of American cotton prices this year. Although this is due to the general decline in prices, the decrease in consumption is actually a major factor. The production of 14 million bales of American cotton is quite appropriate under normal circumstances, but under the current state, it is felt to be too much. And various countries are still working hard to plant cotton. In the future, the dominance of American cotton in the cotton markets of various countries may not be as superior as in the past. Although the government authorities are absorbing new cotton on one hand and advising cotton farmers to reduce planting on the other, in order to increase cotton prices, the general prices are still falling, and cotton farmers will have nowhere to adapt. The low rate of wheat prices has now exceeded cotton prices. It is feared that the effect of farmers abandoning relatively high-priced cotton and switching to cheaper wheat crops will be minimal. The reason for creating this situation is the international economic changes rather than local problems. Only by hoping for the recovery of the economic situation and causing an increase in consumption can the decline in market prices be resolved. According to the estimation of the Lancashire Cotton Corporation, the low point of American cotton prices in 1930-1931 may exceed that of 1929-1930. The following is an estimate of the supply, demand, and market price of American cotton, which is intended to provide a glimpse of future changes.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was weak first due to a lack of major buyers and Southern hedging sales, and then slightly recovered due to the covering of some short positions. Futures fell by two to two points, and spot prices fell by five points. British cotton futures fell by three to four points, and spot prices fell by five points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by five points. The Indian cotton market was quiet, with Ping Gu Er falling by four rupees, and Cantonese Mule and White Luo Xi falling by three rupees.

<p>Mr. Chen Yingshi, a martyr of the Kuomintang, tirelessly campaigned for the revolution at the time, and his contribution to the restoration of Shanghai and the Republic of China was truly significant. To establish a permanent memorial to commemorate his achievements, a stone monument was erected outside the Old West Gate on Minguo Road in the Chinese area of this city. After several months of construction, it was completed last month. The towering monument is very majestic. It is scheduled to be inaugurated on the morning of November 3rd (today), and people from all walks of life are invited to attend the opening ceremony. Yesterday, the area around the monument was decorated with colorful flowers, pine trees, and cypresses, which were bright and eye-catching. The entire arrangement was quite spectacular. There should be a lively and grand occasion today.</p>

<p>To Be Collected and Distributed by the Municipal Government on Their Behalf</p>
<p>The Zhaoeh Uprising was a major event in the revolutionary process. Regarding the issue of honoring and compensating the martyrs who died in this battle, Mr. Yang Xiaotian, the leader who personally participated in the battle, submitted a request to the National Government for granting official ranks to each martyr and providing preferential treatment to their families. However, the procedures for the family members to receive the compensation were extremely complicated, and it was very difficult for those living in Shanghai to wait. Mayor Zhang of this city, who had followed the late martyr Chen Yingshi in the revolutionary work, was concerned about this and generously took on the responsibility of collecting and distributing the compensation on their behalf. It is reported that the municipal government will directly contact the relevant departments of the central government to ensure that the procedures are expedited and the families of the martyrs are benefited. Upon hearing the news, all the family members were overjoyed.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Yesterday's Public Memorial for Tian Tong <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Tian Ziqin of Hubei passed away at sea due to worrying about national affairs, and the whole country mourned. Recently, his younger brother, Jiweijun, and comrades from various provinces in Shanghai, set up a spirit hall at the Chongfa Zen Temple on Gulou Road yesterday to hold a memorial service. More than 1,300 elegiac couplets from the National Government, Chairman Chiang, Hu Zhantang, Li Xiehe, Zhang Yuejun, Zhang Taiyan, Ju Juesheng, and other comrades were hung in front of the spirit hall. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>The guests who came to the memorial service included Li Xiehe, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, Zhang Yuejun, a representative of the National Government, and representatives of various legal groups, totaling more than 1,000 people. Mrs. Ju Juesheng, because her husband and Mr. Tian worked together for the party and the country, and now one is dead and one is imprisoned, felt particularly sad and distraught when receiving the guests.</p>
<p>The scene of the public memorial service: At around 11 o'clock, Zhang Yuejun, the mayor of Shanghai, offered a sacrifice on behalf of the National Government, with Xi Chulin, the director of the Department of Customs and Rituals of the Ministry of Interior, assisting in the ceremony, and Xiao Qin, the aide-de-camp of the National Government, reading the eulogy. The eulogy read: "On November 2nd, the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, the National Government sent Zhang Qun, the mayor of Shanghai, to offer a eulogy to the spirit of Mr. Tian Ziqin, a former member of the National Government, saying, 'Alas, Mr. Tian, why did you die so suddenly? Recalling your meritorious deeds, my heart is filled with sorrow. In the old Qing Dynasty, the government was disorganized, and eagles and tigers were watching around. You, at a young age, went to study in Wuchang, spoke boldly about the revolution, and vowed to be generous. You were soon detected and arrested, and fled east to Japan. You were determined to defeat the enemy, and your attitude was激昂. You met heroes, and poured out your heart. You met Sun Yat-sen, and were overjoyed. You joined the Tongmenghui, and planned the Kuang Fu. The wind and clouds rose, and the sea looked forward. You returned to join the righteous army, and your spirit swallowed Hunan. Your extraordinary plan failed, and you stumbled in Pingxiang. You tried again and again, and never rested. You were summoned from ten thousand miles away, and rushed to the coast at night. You were like a trapped phoenix, soaring in the sky. You went north to Yanjing, and traveled south to Nanyang. You vigorously refuted heresies, and our way was彰显. You widely proclaimed the 木铎, and the motherland复光. In the Xinhai Revolution, the Yangtze River was浩浩荡荡, who could resist the fierce enemy? You and 克强. People said you were a scholar, but you were a strategist. Whether you won or lost, you shared the joys and sorrows. You created the Republic of China, and sat in the parliament. You had a pen and a tongue, and your arguments were brilliant. Yuan Shikai's claim to the throne destroyed the great defense. You raised troops on the Huai River, and our martial spirit was扬. Heaven did not regret the disaster, and the atmosphere of bandits was rampant. Great thieves stole the power, and clowns jumped around, following each other, causing disaster to the people. The people's livelihood was ruined, and the public's will was divided. The lofty Sun Yat-sen was great and just, recruiting many talents, and opening the government in Guangzhou. The scale was grand, and the doctrine was正皇. After several dangers, the years passed. Alas, Mr. Tian, you were determined to follow, participating in confidential matters, and supporting the纲常. The righteous army pointed north, sweeping away the tigers and wolves. The benevolent are invincible, and no one dared to resist. The people celebrated the arrival of the army, and the people welcomed them with food and pots. The blue sky and white sun shone with ten thousand feet of light. The capital was in Chongqing, and the government was expanded. You offered advice and assisted the central government. Alas, Mr. Tian, your ambition was pure, your conduct was virtuous, your demeanor was upright, and your mind was vast. You possessed morality, and expressed it in writing. Your voice was loud and substantial, and your voice启蒙. You analyzed the essence and swept away the chaff. You were a teacher for the world, and a 吉祥 for the country. Why did you die so early? The heavens and the earth are vast. Remembering the past, my tears flowed down. Let sincerity be clean, and shine in all directions. May your soul be aware, and I offer this cup of wine. Alas, alas, may you rest in peace.' When the comrades read the eulogy, their voices were sad and mournful, and the guests in the hall were all sorrowful. When Mayor Zhang performed the ceremony, he was touched by the scene and missed his friend, and could not help but feel sad and tearful. From 2 pm, comrades from various provinces and relatives performed public sacrifices in turn, which lasted until late at night."</p>
<p>The Telegram from the National Government: Yesterday, the Tian residence received a telegram from the National Government saying, "Mr. Tian Jiweijun, upon the order of the chairman, the National Government's former member, Mr. Tian Ziqin, will be memorialized in Shanghai on November 2nd. Mayor Zhang Qun of Shanghai is appointed to offer sacrifices on behalf of the government. A separate telegram has been sent to Mayor Zhang. The National Government deeply cherishes the elders, and Mr. Tian's contribution to the party and the country is evident."</p>

<p>Chairman's Report: Comrades, today is the day we hold the final of the first Shanghai City Party Member Training Competition. Why are we holding this party member training competition? We know that for a party member, cultivation of party ethics, promotion of work, understanding of party principles, and adherence to party discipline are all very important. Currently, we feel that some comrades are gradually neglecting these issues. As a result, when our party comrades go into society and into public groups, they are not making a good impression. To remedy this crisis, we must intensify our training efforts. We have noted that the current party member training work, in addition to holding party congresses, discussions, and lectures, simply has no other methods. Therefore, we often think about how to encourage the spirit of party members and arouse their interest. Only by solving this problem can we hold party member training competitions. We believe that this competition can greatly help train party members in understanding party principles, abiding by discipline, promoting work, and cultivating party ethics. Now, our first final is being held today. The topics set for the first final are all about party ethics because we are preparing to hold three competitions. The purpose of the first competition is to awaken comrades to the cultivation of party ethics. The purpose of the second competition is to promote comrades' understanding of party principles. The purpose of the third competition is to invigorate comrades' spirit for work and instruct them in work methods. Because the meaning is so important, we also strive to be solemn in handling it. All the details have been published in Shanghai newspapers, so there is no need to repeat them. All of you contestants present today are winners from each district and should be fully prepared. However, there are a few points to keep in mind when speaking: 1. The topic of your speech must be selected within the scope specified by the department and must not be determined on your own. 2. The speech time is set at five minutes and must not exceed seven minutes at most. 3. The winners of the final must submit a 2.5-inch portrait photo and a copy of their speech to the department within five days so that they can be compiled into a separate publication for future commemoration. 4. The order of speeches will be based on the order of registration. 5. The competition will be divided into three categories: meaning, eloquence, and demeanor, but slightly more attention will be paid to the meaning aspect, and so on.</p>
<p>Representative's Address: City Executive Committee Representative Comrade Zhu Yingpeng said in his address, "Chairman, comrades, today is the day of the first final of the Shanghai City Party Member Training Competition. The meaning of holding the party member training competition has just been explained in detail by the chairman. We know that the topic of this competition focuses on party ethics because the cultivation of party ethics is indeed the most needed and worthy of attention at present. We see that the discipline and spirit of our party during the period of secret work were better than now. After the party became public, we look at the discipline of our party and the revolutionary personality of our party members. The facts tell us that some party members have gradually neglected the observance of discipline and the cultivation of personality, thinking that being a party member is a special class. This situation is the greatest danger facing our party at present. If this continues, party members will become corrupt day by day, and the discipline of the party will naturally become more and more lax. The training department of this association has recognized this and believes that in order to continue the unfinished mission of the revolution and remedy the current crisis, the first thing to do is to enable all party members to have a very clear understanding of the cultivation of party ethics. We all know very well that we are now in the period of political tutelage, and its work is more serious and difficult than in the military government period. If we ourselves are not sound, how can we gain the trust of the people and how can we realize our principles to complete the national revolution? Therefore, our country believes that this competition can not only stimulate the interest of party members throughout the city in studying party principles but also awaken the attention of party members throughout the city to cultivating party ethics and continuing the new life of our party. All of you comrades are winners of the semi-finals in each district. I hope that today you will give full play to your abilities and encourage each other. I have high hopes for you."</p>

<h3 id="e173">Reason for Shangguan Yunxiang's Resignation <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Due to Brain Illness Requiring Long-Term Recuperation</p>
<p>Shangguan Yunxiang, commander of the Ninth Army of the Anti-Rebel Army, commander of the Forty-Seventh Division, and commander of the Pinghan Railway Garrison, made great contributions in the recent campaign to suppress Yan Feng, especially in the advance at Qingxiangji and the victories against the odds at Heti Ridge, Libaji, and the first occupation of Zhengzhou. Recently, it was suddenly heard that his resignation had been approved, which surprised people in society. According to a senior officer at the headquarters, Shangguan had been fighting on the Pinghan and Longhai lines for half a year, with remarkable achievements. However, due to overwork, he suffered a brain injury. After arriving in Zhengzhou, he asked the commander-in-chief for a long vacation, which was not approved. After Chiang returned to Beijing, Shangguan again asked Director He Yingqin for a month's sick leave to recuperate in Hangzhou. The affairs of the army and division headquarters were temporarily handled by Vice Commander Hao Mengling and Chief of Staff Gan Fang. After Shangguan arrived in Hangzhou, doctors diagnosed that he needed long-term recuperation. Following the doctor's advice, he insisted on resigning to Chiang. Chiang could not retain him any longer and had to transfer Shangguan to the position of General Counselor. Wang Jinyu was appointed to fill the vacancy, and Chief of Staff Gan Fang also requested to resign to Chiang at the same time. He has been transferred to the position of Lieutenant General Counselor. Chairman Chiang also instructed the two men to recuperate in peace, and after they recovered, they would be rewarded with important positions.</p>
<p>Gan Jicang, Chief of Staff of the Ninth Army of the Anti-Rebel Army, went to Fenghua to meet Chiang the day before yesterday and presented important official matters in person. Chiang did not receive any guests during this return to Fenghua. However, after Gan arrived in Xikou, Chiang met with him for about an hour before sending him back to Ningbo in a special car. It is said that Gan's trip was to report on internal affairs of the army. According to a close friend of Gan, Gan's trip to Fenghua was because the commander of the army, Shangguan Yunxiang, had a deep brain illness. The doctor told him that he needed a long time to recuperate, Shangguan didn't want to go back to the Ninth Army and entrusted Gan to ask Chiang for leave.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Shanghai-based Hunanese Associations and Relief Societies Jointly Petition <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Listing Four Key Points</p>
<p>Petition representatives from Hunan in Beijing and Shanghai, because the bandits and communists in Hunan Province are becoming more rampant, and have recaptured Pingliu and Southern China and other counties, are no longer trying to find a fundamental solution. The people of Hunan in deep water and fire will have no survivors. They gathered representatives in Beijing yesterday morning to petition the central government. The text is as follows: "Presenting this to prevent future troubles, we respectfully request the dismissal of He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Four Routes, to stabilize Hunan Province and consolidate the foundation of the country. We believe that He Jian is greedy, stubborn, false, and reckless, causing repeated disasters. The fellow villagers' associations in the subordinate provinces, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, and Hubei have repeatedly stated his crimes of harming the country and harming the people, and pleaded for punishment to seek a good aftermath. It has already been meticulously documented. Our Central Government is broad-minded and wants to observe the results later, and it also happens to be the time when the campaign against rebellion is urgent, and it is difficult to transfer divisions and brigades. Now that the glory has been restored and the troops are returning south, it is not difficult to quell the banditry by encircling and searching. However, the joy of peace is not only relying on military power to succeed, and the addition of great responsibilities is definitely not something that mediocre people like He Jian can handle. Now, based on what the representatives of various groups in Hunan Province hope for in the joint meeting resolution, we want to use the intention of punishing the past to prevent future troubles to seek a timely way to manage the country. We dare not bother you, but only list the items for our Lord to respectfully present to you. 1. Please punish He Jian to maintain discipline. It has been found that He Jian has long been accustomed to the deception of the rebel Tang Shengzhi. His possession of his current position originally came from secretly colluding with the Gui faction to squeeze out the former post, fearing punishment and surrendering, which was added with the elimination and aid. When Tang rebelled in Zheng, He Jian harbored two ambitions and dared to advocate the maintenance of the territory and the people under the great unification. He was feudal, arbitrary, independent, and unscrupulous, inherited the bad habits of the warlord era, and would have made the party and the country more chaotic if Heaven had not hastened Tang's demise. This year, Yan Feng rebelled together, Zhang Guiheng was connected, He Jian gathered representatives from the north and south in Changsha, and there were secret telegram exchanges almost every day. He cared about the cloud man in the sky, and he was infatuated with the flying wild goose. He did not know the corruption of his subordinates, and he did not see the prevalence of bandits, which led to the capture of both Gui and bandits, and the disasters were overwhelming. Xianyang was half burned, the Guanzhong area was depleted, Wuhan was shaken, and the overall situation was swaying. To this day, bandits and robbers are still rampant in various parts of eastern Hunan, trapped in water and fire, and He Jian can't come up with a solution. He only reports falsely and embellishes his achievements after the bandits retreat. The foundation of the country, discipline is the first priority. If the central government still shows extraordinary tolerance to such a person who is self-interested in owning troops and is fickle and unpredictable, it will make those who are loyal to the party and the country feel discouraged, and those who seize the opportunity to seek profit will become more and more self-centered. Punishing He Jian is what all the people of Hunan Province, regardless of their wisdom, old age, or youth, are earnestly striving for. 2. Please improve the organization of the Hunan Provincial Government. It has been found that the Hunan Provincial Government has suffered from various shortcomings in its organization due to He Jian's incompetence. We dare not make specific accusations here, but we must learn from the past. Therefore, we must seek appropriate people to succeed him. The power to employ people is in the hands of the central government and is not something that the people should interfere with. However, the virtue of talents is related to the governance of the country, and it is also related to the well-being of the people. They are all connected, and they cannot help but hope to get people. We believe that the selection of the chairman should not be a soldier in active service. The Hunan situation has repeatedly arisen from He Jian's control of military power, not to wholeheartedly defend the people, but to monopolize power. Recently, Chen Mingshu, chairman of Guangdong, wrote an article saying that military and political affairs should be separated and should not be given to soldiers in active service, and that the governance of the province should be rewarded to military mediocre. This has always been regarded as the golden rule of politics in ancient history and in the present world. Moreover, our country is now inheriting the bad habit of warlord autocracy. How great are the words, the trajectory of peace. However, in the autumn of chaos and harmony, there are also difficult places to integrate. At this time, the country is in trouble, and the mountains are full of thieves. How easy is it to disarm and repair literature? Today's military knowledge must belong to those who are familiar with research. Then, it is not a soldier in active service, but he must have the ability to command military affairs to be able to cope with the current environment, which is also a necessary condition. However, in our Hunan government, in addition to the chairman, almost half of the provincial committees are soldiers in active service, and many of them are remote and do not hold positions. This is why it is difficult to govern. To govern, we must understand politics. However, He Jian, who has been in power for two years, has no achievements to mention. It is difficult to record his party and government. We must also have a political mind and the determination to clarify official administration, rectify finances, and eliminate bandits. After the great disaster in Hunan, everything is chaotic. How can we seek peace and stability, how can we recuperate, and how can we clear up? If we are not familiar with the situation, we will inevitably have the feeling of closing the door and building a car. As for whether the person is trusted by the central government, admired by the people of Hunan, expands the party's principles, and has a deep historical understanding of the revolutionary process, it is a common qualification. He Jian's heart is rebellious, and our central government is tired of driving, which is why he lacks this qualification. 3. Please thoroughly eliminate bandits and communists. He Jian has spent huge sums of money on cleaning up the countryside, but he has ended up with the disaster of burning and killing. Tracing back to the cause, one is due to embellishment and perfunctory, and the other is due to ignoring the people's groups. Now that the great disaster has been quelled, our central government has a large-scale bandit suppression plan to save our people from the disaster. This is like a accumulated tumor. Military force can only cut and treat it, and disinfection and muscle growth depend on the government to treat bandits and improve local defense, and promote autonomy. This is an urgent task. However, rectifying the officialdom, clarifying the administration, maintaining the wealth of the people, and transforming people's hearts are necessary conditions for thorough elimination. This has the closest relationship with renewing the organization of the provincial government and is what our people are praying for day and night. 4. Please order He Jian to cancel illegal surcharges and reduce the burden on the people. We have found that the Hunan Province's annual income and expenditure in the 18th year can be offset. He Jian used the excuse of rehabilitation, and the military committee decided to collect a rehabilitation donation of 8 million yuan. There are three types of donations: 1. field rent donation and lake field mu donation, 2. business capital donation, 3. county town and urban area house donation. Special commissioners were sent to various counties to urge the collection, which was as urgent as a starfire. This surcharge on the people was neither reported to the government for approval nor decided by the provincial government meeting.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>It is in great conflict with Articles 2 and 5 of the Provincial Government Organization Law promulgated by the government, as well as the repeated orders to cancel surcharges and taxes. His contempt for the law and disregard for the central government have reached such an extent that he should be ordered to cancel He Jian immediately to comply with the orders. Then the people of Hunan will be grateful. 5. Set up a method to help the victims of the disaster. The areas that have been repeatedly affected by bandits are even worse than the battlefield. Burning and destruction are everywhere, and deaths are common. The chickens and dogs in the villages have been destroyed. The boundaries of the fields have also been lost. They are displaced on the roads and ditches. Families are broken, and there is nowhere to rely on. Therefore, I don’t know how many people have died of hunger and disease. Now, the winter solstice is approaching, which will add to the killing cold. He Jian does not seek to save them, but still imposes his surcharges and miscellaneous taxes on our people, as if he is afraid that the people will not be difficult enough, and to increase the current number. Our central government is diligent in consoling the people and is currently trying to provide relief in the battlefield. It has also approved 100,000 yuan for our Hunan. The people of Hunan are deeply grateful. We should ask to issue it as soon as possible or send someone to comfort them, or hand it over to the gentry of Hunan Province to handle it. It is heard that dozens of refugees die every day in the Lushan area, and there are even more scattered. This is an urgent policy to be implemented. He Jian can't be waited for, so we have to look up to the central government. Although what has been presented above belongs to standard governance, it is actually the capital affair. I hope that the Lord will humbly listen and carefully examine the opinions of the people. He will use his natural virtue to benefit the people and create happiness for the people of Hunan. The decisive policy is to punish He Jian first. I am fortunate to have the thought of going out of office and waiting for the order. I am frightened and prolong my eagerness. Republic of China, Year 19.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Yancheng and Funing Fellow Villagers Association Urges to Save the Countryside <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Submitting a Document to the Provincial Government</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Yancheng and Funing Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, because the two counties of Yancheng and Funing have been severely hit by bandits, and the people are in dire straits, sent a document to the provincial government yesterday, asking for the government's (hall) attention to the situation and to quickly clean up the countryside and find a way to provide relief. "We repeatedly saw reports and received letters and telegrams from our hometown, knowing that my Yancheng and Funing have been hit by the disaster of bandit Ma Yuren, who burned, looted, and scattered the tombs and mounds. The strong were scattered in all directions, and the old and weak turned into ditches. The villages were scorched earth, and there was no place to live. Those who saw it were sad, and those who heard it were also sad. Although there are provincial police teams to fight them hard, they are only hiding and ambushing, which is not a thorough solution. If you want to cut grass and remove roots, one, you must quickly clean up the countryside, just like the overturning of the nest does not leave its eggs, so that you can permanently eliminate bandits. Second, you must restore the people's regiments, especially the joint defense, so that bandits can be wiped out at any time and are not easy to produce. Third, the guns captured by the provincial police team are the ones that Ma Yuren and the people robbed from the people, because the people's regiments cannot be in joint defense, so it is difficult for the few to fight against the many. For the sake of the present, the guns will be returned to the people's regiments, and they will be strictly trained and united with the group. The bandits will also be frightened. The above are all about eliminating the disaster. As for the relief part, four, such as quickly allocating provincial funds to relieve the old and young in Yancheng and Funing from the plight of being displaced, hungry and cold, if you do not quickly set up a method, then the dead will die and the survivors will also die. This is indeed a matter that cannot be delayed for a moment. Fifth, please exempt this year's winter transportation, because the officials come from the people and the people come from the soil. Now, the people who rely on the soil for their livelihood have been trampled on. Although you want to dig and dig, you can't get it in the end, so you have to exempt the winter transportation. Sixth, please investigate and seal Ma Yuren's rebellious property as soon as possible and use it for local charity needs, such as using the profits to make small businesses, such as relief centers or vocational training centers, so that the helpless poor people will not end up starving to death, and then gradually restore the vitality of my Yancheng and Funing. The above are all about relieving the poor. We are deeply saddened by our hometowns and appeal to you. I think that you will take the heart of hunger and drown and follow the footsteps of benevolence and righteousness. I sincerely hope that you will examine and implement it, which is a virtue. I am respectfully presenting this to Ye, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Hu, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Various Industries in Minhang Actively Prepare for Associations <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>After Lu Juefei was appointed by the Training Department of the Shanghai County Consolidation Committee as the organizational instructor for the Minhang Industry and Commerce Association, he immediately met with Provincial Instructor Zhang Renjie and others, went to the Minhang Chamber of Commerce, discussed with Chairman Chen Lujun, and convened important figures from the town's business community for talks. As a result, it was estimated that the entire town of Minhang could organize seven industry associations, including rice, dried goods, used clothing, meat, barbering, and restaurants. It was immediately decided that each industry would nominate three or five preparatory members and submit them to the Training Department of the Shanghai County Party Department for approval, after which preparation could begin.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Declaration of the Tea Industry Association <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Our country's tea, due to its excellent quality and taste, has always been praised by the world. Therefore, it occupies an important position in foreign markets. During the most prosperous era, the annual export value was as high as over 50 million customs taels. However, due to tea merchants adhering to old methods and not knowing how to improve, foreign markets have been almost entirely occupied by new tea-producing countries such as England and Japan in recent years, resulting in a gradual decline in export volume. In addition, the right to foreign trade is entirely controlled by foreign merchants, who manipulate prices and engage in various forms of extortion, causing tea merchants to suffer losses and go bankrupt, which is common. Recently, tea merchants Li Jingming, Dan Shoufu, Hu Songpu, Cheng Baozhang, Yu Jin, Wang Sipu, and others initiated an industry association to discuss methods of maintaining the industry. The declaration of the association is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Declaration: Chinese tea is a natural specialty. The tea produced in Anhui is particularly excellent in flavor and aroma, surpassing all others in the world. Unfortunately, operators in this industry have no solidarity and cannot directly export to foreign countries, resulting in repeated failures. Today, the situation has become irreversible. Historically, Russian merchants were the largest consumers. They used to buy directly from our country. Russians, knowing the quality of our products, did not hesitate to pay high prices for transportation. In the past, "Xichun" teas were valued at 100 taels. Since the breakdown of relations between China and Russia, trade has stopped. Our tea merchants did not think of finding ways to change production or find new outlets, leading to the abandonment of the teas and financial losses. This has led people to believe that "Xichun" teas have no other market, encouraging price manipulation. Therefore, the [unclear] association [unclear] intentionally suppresses prices. Initially, first grade "Xichun" teas were still priced at 80-90 taels, and second grade at 50-60 taels. Later, due to the government suspecting Russian merchants of communist tendencies and detaining them in Hankou, trade was temporarily suspended. Our tea merchants were frightened, and the Russians became deeply aware of this. In reality, Russian consumption did not decrease as a result. It only strengthened the resolve to manipulate prices. Recently, they have even lowered the price to over 20 taels. Where can one operate under these conditions? The [Russian] assistance association is the most difficult for our tea industry to deal with. The British, French, and other countries arbitrarily cut prices, even delaying weighing and slow to pay, using false defaults to extort, which is common. There is no reason for the delays, and the unexpected suffering is unbearable. If we do not take immediate action to remedy the situation, not only will our tea firms have no income, but tea farmers will also face ruin. Furthermore, with banditry rampant in the interior, transportation is obstructed, and the tea-producing areas are scattered, making it impossible to transport tea-making materials. Whether we can operate next year is a major problem. We have thought long and hard and decided to conduct a thorough investigation of existing stocks. If this year's stocks are estimated for next year, we will separate the remaining teas according to quality, estimate the price fairly, and determine the lowest level. If foreign firms still want to reduce the price, we must not agree. We will wait for guarantees to be issued next year and promote to the tea-producing areas the production of Mao Feng, Yuqian, and Hong Qing teas for sale to local stores. Next year, we will prepare to suspend foreign trade and wait for opportunities. At the same time, we will petition the government to find other relief measures. If the government cannot provide relief, we will have no choice but to cease operations. This year's market price has fallen to such a low level. Based on this market price as the standard for tea operations, there is no way to operate next year. Moreover, according to recent estimates, the price has fallen again and again. Not to mention the cost of tea production, even the transportation costs are insufficient. For example, "Xiumei" teas are estimated at 9 or 10 taels. As for "Xichun" teas, they are estimated at over 40 taels. "Tuzhuang Zhenmei" teas are estimated at over 30 taels, and "Luzhuang Zhenmei" teas are 10 or 20-30 taels lower. The price of Qining black tea is even lower. These figures are alarming. If prices are further reduced, with "Xichun" teas at 20 taels and "Zhenmei" teas falling another 10 or 20 taels, the firm's capital will certainly be lost, and the pawnshops will also suffer. This is true for those with weak capital. Those with strong capital may also be wiped out. In short, if we cannot obtain a reasonable price for this year's teas and sell them gradually, then we must not collect scraps next year and try our luck. One attempt will lead to a flood of new and old stock, inevitably repeating the current mistakes. Since we are suffering today, let us not sacrifice ourselves next year. We hope that our tea merchants will wake up, maintain our existing strengths, and develop solidarity for future growth. This will be enough to remedy the situation. We are currently investigating the number of Luzhuang teas imported this year and the estimated number. The remaining Zhenmei, Xichun, and other teas are not sufficient to meet next year's sales volume, so there is no fear of being suppressed due to excess goods. Furthermore, we will let foreign merchants know that we are prepared and will not be suppressed again. We are now offering our humble opinion to our colleagues and have scheduled a general meeting for all members on November 9 at the Foreign Trade Association. This matter concerns the overall situation and still requires public discussion. If anyone has a great idea, please express it on the spot and let the public vote. This is an announcement.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Municipal Chinese Medicine Association Held General Meeting the Night Before Last <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Discussing the Issue of Full Merger of Three Organizations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chinese Medicine Association held a general meeting at its new association located at 275 Zhejiang Road, Yizhong Company, on the second floor the night before last. Preparatory committee members present included Xue Wenyuan, Ding Zhongying, Zhu Shaowu, Yu Hongsun, Cheng Diren, and nineteen others. Xie Liheng was publicly elected chairman, and Jiang Wenfang recorded the proceedings. The chairman first reported that 1) membership in the association had reached 1,237 people in the past two months, and the general membership meeting was scheduled for the 10th of this month; 2) member [unclear] Xiaoyan was wrongly accused. The association's certification had already led the Health Bureau to return his license and the Provisional Court to dismiss the prosecution; 3) member [unclear] Yuting reported being obstructed in his business, and the association had investigated and the offending person had provided a written apology; 4) the association had jointly hosted Mr. Fairbairn with various organizations, and he had expressed satisfaction with the Chinese Medical College established by the association; 5) the [People's] Council had issued a clear order for the Shenzhou, Zhonghua, and Chinese Medicine three organizations to cease activities and merge into the association. The attendees were asked to report on the opinions of the various organizations. Jiang Wenfang stated that Shanghai's Chinese medicine community has historically had the organization of three bodies. Continuing that they have felt the need for concentrated unification, they formed this association, while the three groups still engaged in the same objectives and duties. They avoided power and rights, so the strength of the group reduced invisible. The enterprise of Chinese medicine was not easy to progress, resulting in suppression of the Ministry of Civil Affairs. It can be especially regreted now that most of the groups members are in favor of the merger, to avoid duplicated efforts. Bao Shibing said that Chinese medicine community groups were formed solely to seek public service development. Merger would have a strong power. As the initiator of Shenzhou, the presiding over association affairs for the longest time, he knew the Shenzhou commission would be aware of the implications. Chuan Yongyan said that a union is effective, a separation is ineffective. Zhu Hegao said that in the past few days, he had investigated the opinions of 150 members of each organization and found that the Zhonghua Chinese Medicine and other groups did not hold a single meeting throughout the year and were controlled by one or two people. The membership was thus extremely eager to merge. The funds held by each organization amounted to over 20,000 yuan, but most of them were lost and difficult to close. Zhang Zanchen said that the committee members of this association were mostly committee members of the three organizations, so why separate and create more committee titles, which cost more membership money. Xia Zhongguang said that from the standpoint of a party member, organizations that did not comply with orders could not establish committees, and members who did not comply with party orders could not engage in group activities and would be subject to punishment. Next, the discussion of the proposals began. Proposal 1: Should we welcome the merger of the three Chinese medicine organizations into this association? 1. The Chinese Medicine Club established by the association will invite committee members from the three organizations to hold a joint meeting on the afternoon of the 5th at 5:00 PM. 2. Members of each organization who join this association before the general meeting will be exempt from membership fees. 3. Extend the date of the general meeting so that new members have voting rights. 4. The employees hired by the three organizations have served the Chinese medicine community for a long time. Now that activities have ceased, this association should send a letter of invitation to join the work of this association. Proposal 2: The association should immediately notify the members who serve the work of the three organizations to cease activities to avoid violating party orders. Resolved: Passed. Proposal 3: The association should immediately notify all Chinese medicine practitioners in the city to clarify the truth. Resolved: The association's editorial committee will handle. Proposal 4: How should the association handle the merger issue of the three Chinese medicine organizations? Resolved: Each organization should first close down on its own. That evening, 28 committee members from the three organizations, including Shen Xinjiu, Huang Baozhong, Xu Shoupeng, and others, gathered at the Chinese Medicine Club and unanimously signed a statement urging the standing committees of the three organizations to expedite the closure. It was later learned that the six standing committee members of the three organizations were holding a meeting at a certain medical residence in Beining [unclear] Bridge and decided that the chairman [unclear] would send a letter urging them to comply with the order to merge and not to act rashly, lest they make repeated mistakes, respect public opinion, and maintain the overall situation together.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Coal Industry Petitions the Ministry of Railways to Promptly Order Railway Bureaus to Protect Domestic Coal <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Maintain the Reduced Coal Transportation Rates on the Jiaoji Railway</p>
<p>The Coal Industry Association petitions the Ministry of Railways to request the maintenance of the reduced coal transportation rates on the Jiaoji Railway: Because the Jiaoji Railway Bureau has cancelled the original reduced coal transportation rates, which is confirmed to hinder the development of domestic coal and promote the sale of foreign coal, we respectfully present the reasons and request your review and approval to maintain the old rules and allocate more coal transportation vehicles to alleviate the coal shortage and protect domestic production. The areas along the Jiaoji Railway, such as Boshan and Zichuan in Shandong Province, are all coal-producing areas. In addition to supplying the province for consumption, a large amount is transported and exported annually by the Jiaoji Railway. Currently, the import of foreign coal is increasing daily, and domestic coal is hindered by the war and transportation is stagnant. Only Boshan and Zichuan can load and export from Qingdao, which is only a slight resistance. Examining the Shanghai Customs import trade register, the item of foreign coal reaches tens of millions of yuan annually. Such outflow of profits is not trivial. Blocking the leak is the urgent task of our country today. The original regulations of the Jiaoji Railway stipulated that export transportation costs for domestic coal would be reduced by half. This method is a major plan to promote domestic coal and resist foreign goods. The law is good and the intention is beautiful, which is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. However, it has not had a huge effect because 1) the methods of mining and coal mining have not been improved, resulting in excessive costs and the inability to compete with foreign coal, and 2) there is a lack of vehicles, which cannot fully meet the transportation needs. The coal from Boshan transported to other ports relies entirely on the halved transportation costs, so that producers and merchants can survive. If the reduced rates are abolished, the cost of domestic coal will increase suddenly. Not only will coal merchants be deterred, but the mined coal will inevitably pile up on the mountains, and the completed mines will inevitably be shut down. The livelihood of hundreds of thousands of workers will also be cut off as a result. The opportunity for foreign coal to invade will expand. The harm to the national economy and the people's livelihood cannot be described in words. If the railway authorities want to increase revenue, they should prepare more vehicles for transportation, which is the best policy. If the original reduced rates are abolished, the transportation rate will inevitably decrease revenue and retreat, and the desire to benefit will turn to loss. Now that the military affairs have been pacified, the original state has gradually recovered, and the mines and coal can be mined as much as possible. In addition to supplying domestic needs, it can be exported in large quantities to resist foreign coal. This is the common hope of the people, to block the leak and expand rights, and to seek national wealth and promote people's livelihood. The National Railway has the obligation to facilitate domestic goods and support domestic coal. Reading Dr. Sun Yat-sen's National Construction Strategy and industrial policy, the development of domestic coal is listed as an important plan. Our government will maintain and support it. How can we abolish the benefit transportation method? It seems to conflict with the party's righteousness and government orders. Therefore, we dare to express our foolish sincerity and petition your ministry to review and promptly order the railway bureau to maintain the old rules, support domestic coal, increase the number of vehicles, and transport as much as possible to benefit the country and the people. We feel the danger and dare not be silent. We dare to express our humble words and hope for your understanding and approval to implement, which is for the public good.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector of the Public Concession Bureau of Public Works, in view of the increasingly cold weather in recent days, the petty thieves and bandits will inevitably take advantage of the situation to steal and rob. In order to strictly prevent this, he has issued a special order to all police stations and headmen to pay close attention. Therefore, the police stations have been particularly thorough in their prevention during the morning and evening hours in recent days. Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, areas such as Edward Road on the border of the British and French Concessions and Bailinan Road in western Shanghai were patrolled by one European police officer and eight Indian police officers, conducting thorough inspections along the way. Anyone with suspicious behavior was interrogated and searched. They followed and checked, which was quite thorough, until around 9:00 AM, when they were all withdrawn.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter Requesting Admonition of Loan Rent Collectors <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Recent Housing Donation Tickets Should Be Used as the Standard</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Municipal Finance Bureau stating that it received a letter from the local blacksmith association on the 20th of this month, stating that the loan rent collectors came to the meeting yesterday to collect rent for the month of January, saying that the assessed rent was 60 yuan. [The blacksmith association] immediately replied that the assessed rent did not match, but the collector insisted on collecting the full amount on the 31st of this month. [The Municipal Chamber of Commerce] examined the quarterly housing donation ticket which indicated the rent was 45 silver yuan per month. It has since submitted the autumn housing donation ticket and request a reply from the Finance Bureau with transfer to the collection office for loaning the monthly rent of 45 yuan, as stated in the donation ticket. Enclosed is the donation ticket. Article 7 of the Shanghai Revenue Short-Term Treasury Bill Loan Rent Regulations states that the rent for each household should be based on the amount listed on the most recent housing donation ticket. The autumn housing donation receipt of the association, Huangzi No. 15249 in the southern district, clearly states the monthly rent is 45 silver yuan. The landlord must pay an autumn donation of 6 yuan and 75 cents. The rent collector should collect a fixed amount of 45 yuan per month, but he arbitrarily increased the price to 60 yuan, which is a violation of the regulations and is akin to illegal collection. The association previously reported that the paint industry association reported that the collectors in the district also did not follow the amount on the donation ticket and arbitrarily increased the price for collection. A letter was sent on the 27th of this month to request investigation and obstruction. Up to the point of another report by the public association of a former situation, the assessment suggests the collectors in each district are not able to act by law. As a response, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce submits a letter and requests to notify this district to act in accordance with the law. On the other hand, it asks that there be a strict admonition for all district collectors.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Zhabei Military Garment Factory Fire: Over a Hundred Workers' Cries Shook the Heavens <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Most of the Hundred-Plus Workers Were Burned</p>
<p>Approximately Four or Five People Died in the Fire</p>
<p>Factory Buildings, Military Garments, and Machinery Were Reduced to Ashes</p>
<p>The Third Factory of Fuchang Military Garments, located on Gonghe Road in Zhabei, suddenly caught fire due to carelessness at 3:50 PM yesterday. Over a hundred workers in the factory were mostly burned, and approximately four or five lost their lives. The number of those temporarily unaccounted for is not included. The total loss of materials, military uniforms, machinery, and buildings is estimated to be around 30,000 yuan. The fire started at 3:50 PM and was extinguished by 5:30 PM. Ten multi-story buildings and five single-story buildings were all reduced to ashes.</p>
<p>The Fuchang Military Garment Third Factory, specializing in manufacturing military uniforms, is a branch established by the Fuchang Company on the Hongqiao pier outside the Broadway Road in the Public Concession. It originally dealt in woolen fabrics but later switched to military uniforms. Recently, due to business development, it established Factories One and Two on Shanyang Road and Gonghe Road in Zhabei at the end of August this year, specializing in military uniforms. Although the Third Factory on Gonghe Road is temporary, it employs a large number of workers. The first batch of cotton military uniforms was 40,000 sets. Recently, it also bid to the Nanjing General Headquarters and undertook a large number of military uniforms. Therefore, the main factory and the first and second branches all started working day and night to rush the new uniforms.</p>
<p>Sudden Fire: The Third Branch, which caught fire yesterday due to carelessness, is located at No. 209 at the intersection of Gonghe Road and Huakang Road in Zhabei. It was originally a weaving factory, later rented by Baolin to establish a cotton factory. At the end of August this year, it was subleased to Fuchang. The factory building consists of ten multi-story buildings and five single-story buildings. Fuchang Military Garment Factory rented five single-story buildings and five bays of the multi-story buildings along Gonghe Road. The rest was used by Baolin's waste cotton factory. Yongting and Jintai also set up within. The workers employed by the Fuchang Military Garment Factory are all female workers, about a hundred people, and only more than ten male workers. Yesterday at around 3:50 PM, a shout was suddenly heard in the cotton fluffing room, shouting fire alarm. Hearing the alarm, all the workers were frightened and ran for their lives.</p>
<p>The Fire Was Very Fierce: Cotton is originally flammable, and the cotton used in military uniforms has been treated to be light, loose, and dry, making it even more flammable. Therefore, after carelessness in the cotton fluffing room downstairs, it spread up and down in a moment, and the fire tongues spread in all directions. The entire factory building was filled with smoke and flames. In an instant, order was in great chaos, and the female workers were calling for help and shouting wildly, with no solution. In addition, most people were upstairs. Hearing the fire alarm, they all rushed to escape down the stairs. There were too many people and the stairs were small, unable to descend. Therefore, countless people were burned.</p>
<p>Difficult to Extinguish: After the fire broke out, the fire brigades from various sections of Zhabei drove to the scene to extinguish the fire. The fire brigade of Section One arrived at the scene especially early. No less than a dozen fire engines arrived at the scene, trying their best to put out the fire. However, there were as many as 250 bales of cotton stored in the factory, and there were also about seventy or eighty military uniforms that had been made. After the fire, cotton wool was flying everywhere, chain burning, so that there was fire everywhere. Even with a hundred jets of water, it was difficult to save. Moreover, the building of the factory was also old, decayed and withered, and would fall down at a touch. Therefore, it was not easy to spray water on the one hand and rescue the factory workers on the other.</p>
<p>Mostly Burned: Nine out of ten workers in the factory are female workers. When they worked, they often brought their children to play. Therefore, there were also many children in the factory. After the fire, mothers looked for their daughters, fathers looked for their sons, and the cries shook the sky. Except for those who were downstairs and strong, who were able to escape through the door nearby, seventy or eighty percent were burned by the flames. Fortunately, the firefighters tried their best to put out the thick flames gradually, and on the one hand, ordered the workers to break out of the fire, but sixty or seventy people had been burned and fell and injured.</p>
<p>Crying to the Hospital: The female workers who were burned by the fire shouted and screamed in pain for a while, at a loss. Fortunately, the Xinmin Road Pushan Hospital was not far away. Therefore, those who could still walk all shouted and cried with injuries to the Pushan Hospital for help. The doctors in the hospital initially saw only six or seven people arriving and thought that the fire was still light. Who knew that during the bandaging and treatment, three or four groups later came in disarray, countless, crying and crying, which was very pitiful. Therefore, Dr. Zhu and others supervised the assistants to take care of the treatment in order, no less than sixty people before and after.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Deaths and Injuries: The fire was extinguished around 5:30 PM. The number of those burned to death and scorched to death was temporarily impossible to investigate. However, in addition to the more than sixty people who went to Pushan Hospital for treatment, the rest were sent by the Public Security Bureau Fire Brigade and other hospitals to the Red Cross Hospital, Baolong Hospital, Renji Hospital, and Guangren Hospital for treatment. The known deaths are as follows: two in Pushan Hospital, one in the Red Cross Hospital, Chen Kashi and Wang Cailin in Baolong Hospital. The hospitalized: Zhu Shunzhi, Yong person, twelve years old in Renji Hospital, Wang Cailin, Jiangbei, fourteen years old in Baolong Hospital, Gu Yu Shi, thirty-three years old, Menghe person, Li Hu Shi, thirty-two years old, Xuzhou person, Ye Yu Shi, forty-three years old, Yong person, Yuan Zhu Shi, forty-six years old, Shaoxing person, her daughter five years old, and four others were sent to Qianyi Trauma Hospital, all women.</p>
<p>Police Suppression: When the fire broke out, the police from the Fourth District Public Security Bureau dispatched many police officers to the fire scene to suppress it, and arrested Zhang Caihua, supervisor of the related Fuchang Military Garment Factory, Liang Youfang, inspector, and Yu Duanfu and Bao Guohan of Baolinji Waste Cotton Factory and other factory management personnel to the district office for interrogation. The manager of Fuchang Military Garment Factory is Wu Desheng from Fenghua, and the founder of Baolinji is Bao Linshu from Yong. When the fire broke out, they were not at the scene. Only part of the two factories has fire insurance.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Fire Scene: The burned area is not very wide, at the intersection of Gonghe Road and Huakang Road, next to the old site of the Fourth District Branch Security Bureau in Zhabei. The reporter went to watch after the fire was extinguished. At that time, the smell of burned cotton rushed into the nose. The firefighters were all busy working. The short walls and bamboo fences along the street had all collapsed and were burned. Bricks and tiles and withered wood were piled on the ground. Cotton and military uniforms were all gone. Only a gunpowder room at the entrance of the factory was fortunately not affected when the fire broke out, otherwise the huge loss and the intensity of the disaster would be unimaginable.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Smuggling Chinese into America, Commonly Known as "Hiding Yellow Fish" <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Li Zaichen Had "Hiding Yellow Fish" Behavior</p>
<p>Extorted 4,000 Yuan by Thugs</p>
<p>Li Zaichen, a Ningbo person and steward of the American merchant ship "Xuefupai" (transliteration), was coerced by Wang Fucai, the head of the sailors on the ship, using threats at 8:00 AM on the 30th of last month. Wang, with his gang, took Li to Room 13 of the Ningbo Hotel at No. 19 Dongxinqiao Street in the French Concession, extorting 4,000 yuan on false pretenses. After the case was exposed, the Chinese detectives Feng Qi, Liu Junjie, and Shen Dehui from the Hongkou Police Station arrested Wang Fucai and his accomplice, Xu Lihui, a Ningbo person, at the Taiping Wharf outside Hongqiao on Broadway Road at around 10:00 AM the next morning. The former morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the Special Zone Court. According to the statement of the case by Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the police station, according to American law, all Chinese who want to study or do business in the United States must obtain a passport from the US Consulate before they can land, otherwise they will be rejected. If they land secretly, they must be dealt with in accordance with the Immigration Law. After the term expires, the Chinese will be sent back to their home country. The plaintiff privately took many Chinese to the United States, without ship fees and without passports, secretly landing and obtaining a lot of money. This kind of behavior is commonly known as "hiding yellow fish", and the defendant Wang Fucai knew this and used this "hiding yellow fish" as a reason to extort the plaintiff. If the plaintiff really had such a thing, then he would also violate the immigration law of the country. Later, Chinese detectives Liu Junjie and others stated one after another that when arresting Wang Fucai, they saw many thugs gathered there. Later, the plaintiff pointed out that Xu Lihui was also present at the Ningbo Hotel when he was defrauded, so he was arrested and other words. According to the plaintiff Li Zaichen, he was a steward on the American ship Xuefupai, and the defendant Wang Fucai was a colleague. The ship arrived in Shanghai at 2:00 PM on the 30th of last month. After unloading the goods, I went ashore at 5:00 PM and went to the Hua general manager's office in Room 99 of the Dadong Hotel to report everything. After a while, Wang Fucai came and invited me out for dinner. Just out of the hotel door, I was coerced by him with many thugs to the Ningbo Hotel in the French Concession and extorted 10,000 yuan. His accomplice, Zhu Heshang, took out a pistol to threaten me, saying at least 4,000 yuan, otherwise he would dig out my eyes. I had no choice but to agree. I paid 200 yuan first, and made a note for the balance, and agreed to pay the money at the Taiping Wharf on Broadway Road the next morning. After I escaped, I went to the Hongkou Police Station to report and send detectives to arrest him and so on. Wang Fucai claimed that the plaintiff had asked him to go to Huashunlai Law Firm at No. 20 Jiya Lane, Daigou Bridge at about 7:00 PM on that day to negotiate. When he went there to wait for the plaintiff, he did not meet him. At about 8:00 PM, he received a phone call saying that he was in Room 99 of the Dadong Hotel. I went there and talked a few words with him, and went to Zhu Heshang's place in Room 13 of the Ningbo Hotel in the French Concession to settle the yellow fish money. Because the plaintiff had brought a total of 18 Cantonese people to the United States to work before leaving Shanghai, and when the ship arrived at the American wharf, he arranged for 8 people to land. The remaining 10 people could not get their wish and were brought back to Shanghai. I know that he made a lot of money. Each person who landed was 1,450 yuan, totaling more than 10,000 yuan. I partnered with him in this yellow fish business. When the ship returned to Shanghai, he was on the ship and had already promised to give me 4,000 yuan, so I settled the account with him at the Ningbo Hotel, and there was no extortion with thugs. The 200 yuan mentioned by the plaintiff was also not received, and Zhu Heshang did not threaten with a pistol, etc. Xu Lihui's statement was ambiguous. The plaintiff Li Zaichen denied privately taking 18 Cantonese people to the United States. However, there were indeed 10 Chinese people brought back when the ship arrived in Shanghai this time. The 10 people were detained by the US Immigration Bureau and had no passports, so they were sent back to their country. After I was suspected of this, I have already resigned to the shipping company. The defendant's agent, lawyer Fan Gang, stated that the two parties were actually arguing over the yellow fish fee, not extortion. Therefore, he requested that the defendant be allowed to be released on bail pending trial. Judge Ge Zhiqin verified the confession and ordered the defendant Wang Fucai to be remanded, Xu Lihui to pay 1,000 yuan bail, and reschedule the hearing for further verification.</p>

<p>Three People Arrested</p>
<p>Tang Jihua, alias Yujun, a Ningbo person from Zhejiang, was a staff member of the First Section of the Qingdao Municipal Government. He asked for leave to return home. After finishing his business, he took the Xin Ningshao steamboat to Shanghai in Ningbo. Yesterday morning at about 7:00 AM, after the boat arrived in port, Tang took a number of luggages and prepared to hire a carriage when suddenly a number of people looking like rickshaw pullers rushed forward, surrounding him. They started by arguing about the fare, then suddenly said sternly, you're a solo traveler with lots of luggage, do you know the rules around here? If you know what's good for you, you better hand over five dollars as a toll, or don't even think about moving an inch. And if you don't have cash, you can leave your clothes as collateral. Seeing that the gang was strong and violent, and unable to fight back, Tang decided to negotiate. In the end, he paid one dollar and two jiao as the toll. The gang then dispersed. After Tang got away, he reported the incident to the patrol officer. Three leaders were arrested: Han Changzhou, Zhao Jinshan, Yang Lianchenzi, all from Yancheng. They were then taken to the First District Main Office, waiting to be investigated by the district chief.</p>

<p>Jiang A'er Was Noncommittal</p>
<p>The Guo Father and Son Re-Litigate</p>
<p>Jiang A'er, a woman from Wuzhen, Zhejiang, is 24 years old. A'er was furious because she was beaten and abused by her husband at home. On June 15 of the old calendar this year, she ran away alone to Shanghai and hid near Pengjiazhai in Pudong. Soon after, she met Jin Qiaojian, a woman from Huzhou who lived near the police station road. Qiaojian claimed that her husband's name was Qu Achun, who opened a recommendation shop, and ordered A'er to stay at her home to introduce people to be maids. A'er listened to the words and believed it was true, and immediately agreed. Long Cai, the son of Guo Wenzhi, a Haimen person living in Pengjiazhai, is now 25 years old and works as a boatman. Because his family is very poor, he has not yet married. Coincidentally, Qiaojian knew Guo well and knew that Guo had no wife, so she secretly discussed with her husband Achun to sell Jiang A'er to Guo as his wife to make a profit. After the plan was decided, they persuaded Guo, claiming that A'er was her sister, only 22 years old, and had not yet been betrothed to anyone, and she was willing to act as a matchmaker to make a good thing happen. Guo saw that A'er looked good and expressed satisfaction. Qiaojian then demanded a gift of 200 yuan, and later reduced it by 25 yuan, and settled at 175 yuan after both parties agreed. On the auspicious day of July 3 of the old calendar, A'er was sent to Guo's house to get married. A'er did not know the inside story, only knew that she was recommended by the shop owner to Guo's house to help work. Unexpectedly, when she arrived at the Guo's door, firecrackers were set off, and the house was full of incense and candles. At the same time, A'er was also pushed into the room and slightly decorated, and then she and Guo worshiped each other in front of the ceremony table. At this time, A'er was like falling into a fog, letting it be done. After spending the night with Guo, she asked about the details and told Guo that she was already a married woman and not Qiaojian's sister. Guo knew he had been fooled, and the next day he and his father Wenzhi prepared a statement requesting the local court to file the case, and lived with A'er in a perfunctory manner, just like a couple. Recently, the Guo father and son were afraid that A'er's original husband would find out after a long time, causing disputes, so they filed a statement with the local court accusing the Qiaojian couple of fraud and demanding the gift money. Yesterday, the court sent a document to the Pudong Third District Public Security Bureau to send the police to arrest the defendants Jin Qiaojian and her husband Qu Achun, and summoned the plaintiff Guo father and son and the person involved, Jiang A'er, to interrogate them one by one. The verdict was that they should be sent to the court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Should be Separated</p>
<p>No Need for Alimony</p>
<p>Nie Yongfu, also known as Xiao Dezi, lived in front of Meixielu. His wife, Tang, was called Aipangzi because she was short and fat. Xiao Dezi and Aipangzi were originally an illegitimate union. At first, they were very affectionate and got along very well for five or six years. In April of this year, Nie returned to his hometown of Yancheng, and Tang stayed in Shanghai and fell in love with Lin Dajuzi, who was a partner of Yang Chunshan, who lent money at high interest rates. In August, Nie returned to Shanghai and found out about it and beat Aipangzi, who then escaped. Nie then negotiated with Lin Dajuzi. Yang Chunshan was also present. At that time, there was a conflict, and as a result of jealousy, Nie and a friend were stabbed, and Yang Chunshan on Lin Dajuzi's side died, so Nie was detained. Fortunately, the court verified that Yang died of a chronic disease, so Nie was released on bail, but he had been in prison for a month. Unexpectedly, Aipangzi recently petitioned the civil court of the local court, accusing Nie of abuse, and used up the money left by her ex-husband, requesting a divorce and giving considerable alimony. The afternoon before yesterday, Judge Wang opened a court to hear the case. Nie filed a counterclaim, saying that after he returned to his hometown, his wife pawned two Zhigongni gowns, two gold rings, a gold bracelet, and 47 yuan in cash, all for the use of her lover, which could be investigated. The woman said that it was her pawned items before and should not be returned. It was immediately considered that the debate was over. Now it has been ruled that due to the illegitimate union, there is no contract and the relationship should be separated. Since it is an illegitimate union, there is no need for alimony and it is rejected. However, Tang should return the counterclaim filed by Nie.</p>

The district ordered the police to investigate, but the defendant was not at home, so Zhou was taken to the district for interrogation. According to the interrogation, because her husband Hongqiu was outside, prostituting and gambling, and being absurd and unruly, she knew Li Sanpin and lived together in Pudong on August 18 of the old calendar. She was willing to live with Li and refused to return home. The district chief repeatedly persuaded her, and Zhou suddenly understood. As a result, the district chief allowed Shan to take his wife home and reunite a good dream.</p>

<p>Wang Mingda Has No Right to Interfere</p>
<p>Xu Xue, a woman from Danyang, is now 29 years old. Her husband went out to do business three years ago and his whereabouts are unknown. The family has nothing but empty walls and no constant property. Because of the difficult life at home, she brought her nine-year-old daughter Ai Di to Shanghai this spring to work in a yarn factory and stayed at the Zhao family, a fellow villager in Yangshupu. Zhao entrusted someone to recommend her to work in the coarse yarn room of the Yihe Yarn Factory. She is slightly beautiful, and although she is a middle-aged woman, she still has charm. Before long, she had an affair with Wang Mingda, a Zhenjiang person living nearby. Wang works as a tailor and is now 28 years old. Since the affair, she could not be blatant because she was staying at the Zhao family. So this summer, she moved out of the Zhao family on the pretext of returning home, and moved to the back building of a tailor shop on Lafayette Road in the French Concession with Wang to live together, just like a couple. She immediately led her daughter to a nearby cigarette factory to pack cigarettes. However, Wang's work was light in the summer and his monthly income was very small. He relied entirely on the wages earned by her to make up for the long-term expenses. She inevitably complained, so they often quarreled. She felt that Wang was difficult to grow old with, and she knew Cai Xiaoxiang, a street runner of the cigarette company, and built another love nest on the upper floor of the Fengtai small cigarette paper shop in Liangzhuqiaojia. She often went there with Cai for secret meetings. After a long time, Wang found out. At 8:00 PM the night before last, she was in the adulterous place with Cai, and Wang gathered thugs to catch the adulterers, and arrested her and Cai. After questioning by the head of the police station, Wang and she were not formal couples and had no right to interfere, and he refused to deal with it. The vinegar storm dispersed.</p>

As a result, Cao argued that there was a wrongly stamped copper coin and argued with Zhang. Zhang refused to agree. Cao returned the cigarettes and the change to the store. Zhang refused to accept it. The two sides argued and then fought. Zhang Wenjin broke Cao Guisheng's head with an abacus, causing blood to flow. Cao was injured and fell to the ground and shouted for help. The onlookers gathered and criticized Cheng for not violently assaulting the customer. They reported to the patrol police, who arrested him and sentenced him to fifteen days as a warning. The injured Cao Guisheng went to the hospital for treatment.</p>

The other day in the morning, she went to Cheng Guanyun, a man from Pudong who runs a tofu stall at No. 7 Meixie Road, to buy tofu worth eighteen copper coins. Cheng, seeing her beauty, began to flirt with her, angering Yuan Xu Shi. She threw the tofu she had bought and overturned Cheng's tofu stall, causing Cheng Guanyun to become enraged. He then attacked Yuan Xu Shi with fists and feet. According to Yuan Xu Shi, she was kicked in the lower abdomen, affecting her two-month pregnancy, causing unbearable pain. She returned home clutching her stomach and told her husband, Yuan Fa. Yuan then invited some local toughs to reason with Cheng Guanyun. The matter was settled peacefully the next day. However, at 9:50 AM yesterday, Yuan again invited Xu Haiquan, who runs a teahouse, to reason with Cheng Guanyun, claiming that his wife had miscarried and was bleeding, and demanded a large sum of money. Cheng Guanyun, outnumbered, found an axe and intended to fight. As they were fighting, Dou Zhijie, a watchman from the 22nd post of the Second Precinct's Second Division, arrived and arrested Cheng, Yuan, and Xu. After questioning them, Chief Guo learned the details and had Yuan Xu Shi brought in. She testified that she had been harassed while buying tofu and kicked in the lower abdomen, causing abdominal pain and miscarriage. It was determined that Cheng Guanyun had injured Yuan Fa's wife, Xu Shi, and that Yuan Fa, along with the hooligan Xu Haiquan, had engaged in extortion. Both were illegal. The case was deemed criminal and they were sent to the local court for trial.</p>

<p>Since the new landlord, Chengyu Company, announced the demolition of the houses in Tedenham Lee, Nanyang Bridge, in the French Concession, the tenants have been alarmed. They organized a tenants' association to negotiate with the landlord. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, all the tenants convened a second meeting at the Nanyang Bridge Business Association. All the tenants were present and elected Lin Zhengtang as chairman. He reported that the association had followed the previous resolution to send five representatives to demand that the landlord cancel the demolition plan. The association also sent a letter in the name of the tenants' association to request that the demolition be stopped. However, several rounds of negotiation were rejected. The landlord of Chengyu Company is Xing Dingcheng, a comprador of Sassoon &amp; Co. The case of the houses in Qingyun Lane, Hongkou, remains unresolved. Now, he is forcing the tenants of Tedenham Lee to move out. How should we deal with this? Please discuss, he asked. The tenants expressed their opinions and unanimously advocated firm opposition. It was resolved to implement the following measures: (1) Gather all efforts to resist to the death. No matter what, we will never move. (2) The tenants' association will issue a declaration detailing the age of the houses and the illegal oppression and forced eviction by the landlord, and inform all citizens of the city to rise up and overthrow the housing barons. (3) Make slogans and distribute them to each tenant to post to show the spirit of unity. (4) Submit petitions to the Chinese and French authorities requesting measures to stop the demolition.

<p>The Yongkang Lane area on North Sichuan Road has a total of fifty buildings. In the past, the Yongkang Company leased land to build houses for a term of twenty years. There are only three years left until the lease expires. Now, the company has sold these houses to Wanfu Company and plans to demolish them immediately, ordering all tenants to move out. The tenants are greatly alarmed because the land lease for these houses will expire soon and there is no need to demolish them. It has also been found that the company will take back the houses, make some repairs, and increase the rent from 16 yuan per month to 35 yuan. Therefore, they jointly hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit with the local court to prevent the relocation. The case has been heard several times without a resolution, and a settlement has been ordered. Yesterday, the Yongkang Lane Tenants' Association held a meeting to discuss the situation. Chairman Zheng Guogan reported on the settlement situation in court by Judge Zhao. Then, Executive Committee member Ouyang Hengyi spoke up, saying that a Mr. Zhou had come to see him the other day, claiming to be a representative of the landlord, and offered 1,400 yuan to have the tenants move out, which the Executive Committee member rejected. The crowd discussed it for a long time before adjourning the meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e221">A Retrospective and Prospective View of the Chinese Children's Welfare Association (Continued) Wu Weide <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>In the area of social education, our association, in order to promote child welfare work, popularize child welfare knowledge, and facilitate the child welfare movement, held a grand child welfare movement conference for four days starting from the 7th of December in the 18th year of the Republic, at the Martyr's Hall of the Shanghai YMCA. The aim was to arouse social sympathy and promote the success of child welfare undertakings. A total of 86 cooperating organizations, 530 cooperating personnel, and over 40,000 guests attended the conference, distributing over 70,000 copies of publications. Exhibits came from twelve provinces and regions within the country. Children from neighboring countries such as Japan, Russia, France, England, and the United States also enthusiastically participated in the performances, truly making it an unprecedented grand event. Furthermore, in the Zhabei area of Shanghai, there are many poor households. Due to the public's lack of hygiene knowledge, diseases are rampant, especially with the most infant deaths. Therefore, in June of this year, our association specifically held a hygiene movement conference for two days starting from the 18th at the address of our association's Child Welfare Education and Rearing Institute, with the aim of arousing the awareness of local residents and promoting fundamental remedies. A total of 37 cooperating organizations participated, with 88 people receiving physical examinations, 200 people receiving extended medical treatment and model bathing, 1,166 people receiving cholera vaccinations, over 1,000 primary school students participating in the parade, over 10,000 people visiting the hygiene exhibition, and over 40,000 people watching the hygiene education film. It can also be said to be a grand event.</p>
<p>China's child welfare undertakings originated very early. During the Southern Song Dynasty, the government established the Bureau of Child Welfare. So-called infant asylums, orphanages, relief homes for orphans, and homes for poor children can be found in any large city. Although the number is still insufficient, because they are each independently managed and do not communicate with each other, the spirit is extremely loose and isolated. It is difficult to expect the effect of mutual learning, observation, and unified progress. Our association is the only organization in China that coordinates the welfare of all children. Naturally, we should find ways to remedy and gradually improve the situation, and we believe that this is our inescapable and undeniable duty. Therefore, we are now working to connect child welfare organizations across the country, starting with investigating the current situation, hoping to unite these scattered and unconnected child welfare organizations into a whole, systematic large child welfare body. Then, we will concentrate the strength of this large child welfare body to promote the happiness of Chinese children and realize the ideals of the child welfare movement. This certainly cannot be regarded as anything less than a great work. In addition, we are eagerly seeking comrades to establish child welfare branches throughout the country, hoping to build our China into a China centered on the happiness of children. What is our goal? According to the International Child Welfare Association of the League of Nations, it has established several principles regarding the protection of children's rights, and notified governments of all countries to follow them uniformly. What are the principles of the so-called Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child? The contents of these principles are listed below: First, children should enjoy all kinds of material and spiritual rights in order to fully achieve their proper development. Second, the principle of treating children is to feed them when they are hungry, care for them when they are sick, influence them when they are misled, uplift them when they are lagging behind, and provide relief when they are destitute. Third, save children first when encountering danger. Fourth, children should have opportunities to earn a living and should receive appropriate protection. Fifth, we should teach children to realize from an early age that they have a responsibility to serve society to the best of their ability. Now that we know what the standards of children's rights are, let us compare them with the living conditions of Chinese children and see how they compare. Have Chinese children enjoyed the rights they should enjoy?</p>
<p>The target of the Chinese Child Welfare Association is 120 million children, a number equal to the entire population of the United States. Our country's infant mortality rate is the highest in the world, except for India. This is completely a waste. In New Zealand, the infant mortality rate is less than 40 per thousand, while in our country, even according to the lowest estimate, out of every thousand children, 250 die before their first birthday. Every year, our country loses about 10 million young citizens. If children could have their safety planned for and relief implemented, how could it be like this? According to the Ministry of Education's survey, our country has a total of 43 million school-age children, but in reality, only 6.5 million of them enjoy the right to attend school. The remaining more than 80% of children are completely out of school, wasting their golden years. In several provinces in the Northwest, there are famines, and about 5,000 people die of cold and hunger every day. What could be more tragic than this? Nationwide, there are now no fewer than 200,000 children who have fallen into the status of slaves and spend their days living an inhuman life. In addition, countless children with sallow faces and emaciated bodies are begging on the streets. Alas, pity these innocents who are born into misfortune, and have compassion on these children, how can we bear it? All those who embrace humanitarianism, seeing this painful phenomenon, how can they not shed tears of sympathy? How can we provide relief to them and enable them to enjoy the opportunity for proper development? That is naturally the responsibility of us elders. How can we unite comrades and concentrate the strength of organizations to eradicate evil forces and seek happiness for them? That is naturally the step we elders should take. This is the mission of the Chinese Child Welfare Association. (To be continued)</p>
