<h3 id="c20">今日世界之爭端 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>今日世界上之爭端不過二語可以賅括之。以前放棄者現欲收回。以前倖得者視爲固有。一方面欲收回。一方面旣視爲固有。不肯任人收回。於是二者之間。非爭不可已。印度甘地之所以被捕。即是故也。</p>
<p>以殖民地與侵國言。其狀如是。以國際間弱小國與强大國言。其狀亦如是。以一國中得政權者。與不得政權者其狀亦如是。以社會中有勢力者與無勢力者。其狀亦如是是。故以普世界以言今日所有紛紛之爭者。其狀固無一不如是也。</p>
<p>人類之貪欲無饜。能言公理者多。而能行公理者少。他人之權利。一旦乘勢攫爲已有。即視爲分所應得。而决不肯輕以返人。即有時迫於情勢。不能不有返諸人之表示。亦必口惠而實不至。不曰時機未至。即曰程度不足。非至其人出死力以爭。决不肯放棄。故今之所謂有勢力之一方面者。類皆奬勵爭者也。然則善世界之上。安得而有息爭之一日哉。</p>

<p>（特約通信羅羅）</p>
<p>草草完篇之倫敦條約</p>
<p>五國協定與三國協約</p>
<p>英美日之補助艦限制</p>
<p>主力艦建造之休假</p>
<p>地中海風波之險惡</p>
<p>倫敦海軍會議、自開會至今、歷時八十餘日、經過　數之波折、頻於破裂者數次、直至最後之五分鐘、爲顧全各國政府之體面、避免在野輿論之攻擊、列强始獲得一部分之一致、大吹大擂之海軍會議、遂於是草草完篇焉、</p>
<p>五强海軍會議、於昨日（四月十四日）舉行最後之全體大會兩月餘之談判、告一結束、現在祇待起草條約全稿、於本月二十二三日條文即可簽字、至會議之最後結果、實僅獲得英美日三國間之一致、歐洲大陸方面、英法意三國之爭點、則絶未解决、但爲顧全門面避免破裂計、乃將海軍協定劃分爲二部分、其一僅由英美日三國簽字、其一則由英美日法意五國共同簽字、</p>
<p>倫敦會議所成立之條約、全文將於各國簽字後方完全宣布、就目前吾人所知、其内容大略如下、條約全文約分爲三部分第一部分由五國共同簽字、其中所包含之條文、（一）規定主力艦之延期補充、蓋依據華盛頓條約、各國主力艦之已滿使用年齡者、可以改換　充、現大則約定除例外規定者以外、在一九三六年以前、各國槪不補充主力艦隊、此即所謂「海軍休假」（NAVALBOLIDAY）、因此英美日法意預定在五年内新建之主力艦、將一律停造、（二）華盛頓會議規定飛機運送艦之限制、以一萬噸者爲限此次會議、則議定連一萬噸以下者亦一併限制、此外則規定限制艦隊噸數之方法、係就法國提出之總噸數制限、與英國提出之分級制限、採取折衷之方法、（三）規定何種專用船舶可不受限制、此外並規定潛水艇每艘排水量噸數之最大限度、總言之、則此第一部分内所包含之條文、不過對於華盛頓條約限制主力艦之條文、略加擴張、同時對於限制補助艦之方法、規定一大綱以便日後之繼續談判而已、其中比較重要之一項、爲主力艦之休假、此外則均無關海軍限制之實際、</p>
<p>弟二部分、亦將由五國共同簽字、其内容不外二端、（一）規定戰時使用潛水艇之限制、（二）規定海戰中商用船舶之地位、蓋此次會議中雖未提出英國所希望之海洋自由問題、且英美所主張之潛水艇撤廢、亦未能實現然爲滿足美國之要求、不能不有此妥協之規定、此部分雖與裁軍本文無關、然在國際法上、則實添一重要之新節、</p>
<p>第三部分、方涉及此次會議之主要目的、即補助艦隊之數量制限、但因意國堅持法意均等、法國則因英美不願加入地中海保安公約、不允讓步、故五國間不能成立共同之協定、僅由英美日三國簽字於此部分而已、就吾人所聞、英美日三國商定至一九三○年爲止、三國之補助艦噸數限制大略如下、</p>
<p>英國美國日本</p>
<p>備八时砲一四六、八００一八０、００００八、０００之巡洋艦</p>
<p>備六时砲一九二、二００一四三、五００一００、八五０之巡洋艦</p>
<p>驅逐艦一五０、０００一五０、０００一０五、五００潛水艇五二、七００五二、七００五二、七００補助艦隊五四一、七００五二六、二００五六七、０五０總噸數</p>
<p>由上表可知英美兩國之噸數、係採英美絶對均等之原則、英國補助艦總頓數之所以略多於美國、則因對於巡洋艦之需要英美情形不同、美國之大巡洋艦（備八时砲者）噸數多於英國、而英國之小巡洋艦噸數多於美國、同一噸數之巡洋艦、八时砲者戰鬭力當然優於六时砲者、爲維持均平之計故許英國之總噸數、略超於美國、至日本要求對美百分七十之噸數、美國僅允許百分之六十、此次則取折衷之解决、大巡洋艦日本所有者爲美國百分之六十、小巡洋艦及驅逐艦、則日本約有百分之七十、</p>
<p>此三國協定之結果、可使英美日三國在此後六年内、暫時停止補助艦之建造競爭、其最大之利益、乃在於財政方面、據英國工黨機關報ＤＡＩＬＹＨＥＲＬＤ之宣稱、根據此次之三國協定、英國可節省海軍費一萬萬鎊、倫敦會議、表面雖標幟和平人道其内面的目的、無非因各國軍費負擔過重、欲求列强相互諒解、以比較低廉之代價、保障海上覇權、預備下次大戰而已、此次會議雖屢頻於破裂、但各國政府仍再三容忍、努力以求其最後之妥協、實亦以此故耳、</p>
<p>然英美日三國補助艦之制限、雖已獲得相當之結果、而法意兩國艦隊、則仍未受絲毫之制限、此次會議中、雖聲明英法意三國於會議後、仍繼續談判、俾注意兩國亦加入條約之第三部分、完成五國之協定、然就目前情形、法意政府各走極端、似斷無妥洽之可能、不寗唯是、英國海軍對美、雖不得不屈從英美均等之原則、而在歐洲大陸方面、則仍不願放棄其絶對優勢、英國海軍至少必與法意兩國之合併軍力相等、如法意兩國海軍不受限制、任意擴張、則英國爲保持其在地中海之優勢計、亦不得不繼續增造海軍艦隊、因此就吾人所聞、此次倫敦條約中英美日三國簽字之部分、將附加一保留條欵、即聲明如法意海軍談判無結果、則三國亦不受此條約之束縛、如是則所謂三國協定、大實際上仍將視法意談判之成敗、以卜其存亡、苟法意兩國始終背道而馳、則倫敦條約、不過一紙具文、英美日三國之海軍限制、亦等於畫餅充飢而已、</p>
<p>此次會議之結果、最受實惠者、其唯美國乎、英美海軍之均等、經此次倫敦條約而完全確定、從此英帝國不能不將百餘年來獨攬之海上覇權、分其一半於美國、英美兩大國之衝突、在四五年内、自可暫時免於决裂、此誠工黨内閣之一大成功、但在歐洲大陸、法意兩强對抗之形勢、反因此次會議而更見惡化、巴黎羅馬之報紙、已公然發挑戰之論調、近年地中海風波之險惡、未有甚於今日、英國雖欲置身事外、而亦不可得、若以倫敦條約之簽字、爲和平之吉兆殊不免過於樂觀矣、（四月十五日自巴黎寄）</p>

<h3 id="c83">遠東網球錦標 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>日人自信可操必勝</p>
<p>我國選手共起奮勉</p>
<p>日本網球界威權者八十川氏在體育恊會出版的運動界雜誌上有「大會網球日本可以獲勝」一文對於三國之實力、言之至詳、雖不無自信遇深之處、要亦足供吾人之以參考、茲譯錄於后</p>
<p>對於此次遠東大會網球錦標作任何推測的人</p>
<p>决不能忽視今春馬拉尼嘉年會網球比賽的結果、因爲那是菲島代表權决定的比賽、也可算是遠東大會的一個先陣、出塲的不僅是菲島選手中日也都參加、猶其是將來能在東京大會確定相見之中國的林邱與日本的佐藤布井也都參加、</p>
<p>决遇雌雄、</p>
<p>在該會單人比賽中日本的佐藤布井兩氏很容易的獲勝了、本月東京大會中、該兩氏自然可操勝券並可因兩氏單人賽的優勝、使日本有九分勝利的希望、</p>
<p>雙人賽的戰門却不然了、日本選手對此不能大意、菲島阿樂公兄弟的配合是菲島的王者、而且在嘉年會中佐布組亦被打敗、實力珠未可輕視、</p>
<p>從來遠東的雙人比賽也均是苦戰、出席菲島的佐藤布井組本不能算爲最好、從配合上論起來、志村山岸兩人的配搭要高一籌、日本大槪要派後者在此次大會中復仇并雪恥、四雄相遇、定有　　十項成績第二交大陳虞添</p>
<p>王開攝</p>
<p>一塲大大的惡戰、就説大會網球比賽的興味完全在此戰、也不爲過、</p>
<p>菲島的實力到底如何、單人第一要算阿榮公氏之弟、英介約爲弟二、據最近消息二人或因出席的優待條件意不能出席第三是安布以後就是阿樂公氏之兄與桑結生兩人有難分上下之勢、阿樂公氏之兄實非常之足、但技術未能穩、定雙組則有上面提到的阿樂公兄弟組確是日本的勁敵、如果菲島恊會以一定之遠征費而竟不能與彼兄弟以良好之條件時、代其任者當係安布桑結生組實力比較弱多了、</p>
<p>中國方面從殖地可以派遣很超特的選手、今年的選手雖似夫没有多大的精神、但林氏在澳洲、邱氏在新嘉坡都獲過錦標新進之江（道章）吳（仕章）亦是相當健者、第八次大會的勝利、日本應還記得、所以日本對林邱二氏也應留點意、不然萬一之失也難免絶對不發生、但决不至引嚮錦標問題、</p>
<p>總而言之、日本從來未有如今年實力充足的選手、在三國中實力上確佔絶對優勝、加之大會在日本舉行、日本選手更有便宜的地方、遠征隊伍在環境大變的國作戰、若未得充分的休息即出塲、則不論菲律濱或中國都要感覺不利、以氣候論、中國選手所受的影響不如菲隊之甚、菲選手在日本較寒的氣候之下、難有發揮實力之可能、所以只要佐藤方面無過分的故障發生、日本隊可先以三對一破菲軍、其後三對一或四對零勝中國、</p>
<p>女子比賽方面日本固然亦很强硬但不見得能如男子似的很容易的獲得勝利况且菲島的選手中頗有能者．大槪啻衛士總督的女公子可以來朝她雖在馬拉尼决賽戰失敗、但磪是一相當的良選手、</p>
<p>中國女選手尙未確定、上月在杭州獲勝的李梁二女士都有相當的實力、所以决不能再如上次在上海時只集合了些美貌的女子而不以技能爲標準的事、</p>
<p>日本方面、單人賽中有名古星小林智子波福俱樂部的瀧口澪子和飯村敏子、雙人賽有小林朝吹夫人組、都是經騐豐富、實力雄厚的選手、</p>
<p>總括一句説、此次錦標是日本的、中國决不足爲日本之慮日本的對手只有菲律濱、所爭的也不過僅在比例上、</p>

<h3 id="c93">温州見聞錄游· <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>友人唐若谷君。自與歌舞名家李瓔女士結褵後。即偕藝社社長徐心波君及新翁唐玉池先生等赴温州舉辦實業。去今已有二月。昨接新夫婦及徐君之第三次來函。述及温州見聞甚詳。爰錄一二如下。</p>
<p>土語温州土語。有如粤語。學之則較粤語爲易。然其音韻。頗多與英語相同者。可謂巧極。亦足一噱。臂如「否」。温人讀如「諾」。與英文中之NO字無異。此外如「完全」讀如ALL。「看」則讀如SEE。無不吻合英語讀音。是亦中國言語學中之佳材料也。</p>
<p>單角邇來單銀角在上海。已可謂完全絶跡。但温州市面。單角流行獨多。雙角反罕見。即各商店各娛樂者塲所。出入均用單角。每元可換十一角又銅元十四五枚。此又與上海情形不同之點。</p>
<p>愽甌温州第一大商店在五馬街中市。市招曰愽甌自建三層西式高厦。其面積尙不及本市之麗華公司。所採辦之歐西貨物。大有因陋就簡之槪。故温州之時髦女子。在上海人之目光中。猶興落伍之嘆。</p>
<p>歌曲温州之各小學校。去歲春間起。均添設唱歌一科。所敎授者更多黎氏歌曲。以「因爲你」「葡萄仙子」等曲爲最普遍。惟大多數牧童口中。胥喃喃唱「可憐的秋香」一曲爲多。其他如「小小畫家」「七姊妹遊花園」等曲。則不多觀矣。</p>
<p>街福温州有習俗曰攔街福。説者謂每街咸有福氣。必須經本人攔爲已有。方能奏效。故家家户户。莫不以此爲一種小常識陳體强</p>
<p>觀電影宜遠不宜近。遠則光小而淸晰。近則光大而模糊且愈近則光線愈强烈。尤損目力。　　坐人力車須付銀角時。最好叫車夫當面看淸。因好黠車夫。每乘坐者匆遽離開時。易以惡劣鉛角。追來掉換。上當者不一而足。</p>
<p>沿馬路冷僻處之無賴者。每設賭攤誘引行人。且亦多見勝利者。實皆一邱之貉也。一上其鈎。包敎請君入　。</p>
<p>洗刷牙齒。每多齒血淋漓。若易冷水。可免此弊。以血遇熱則流。冷則凝。故冷水於無形中寓有止血之功。</p>
<p>閲書看報。切戒距離過近。蓋近則減低遠視之可能。日久成自然＂非近視者亦近視矣。</p>
<p>開撥時計。須有定時。譬如今日何時開。明日亦應何時開。開時轉數亦宜一定。母過多。母不及。多則减低法條之彈性。少則不免中途停滯矣。</p>
<p>必需工作。極爲重視。有數上流人物。亦多參加。美其名曰社會娛樂會。此會例應逐日舉行至一個月之久。在每年三月初一起開始熱閙。分三十區輪値舉行。掛燈結彩。爘爛奪目且有各種娛樂。以助餘興。如提線戲。温州戲。京戲。瞎子淸唱。西樂班會奏等。爲温地人士所最合胃口者在此一個月「攔街福」期内。此種玩藝。幾每晚必有。故當地居家。無不穿紅着綠。競事打扮。且開放門禁。任人參觀。並作新奇佈置以相競爭。此類情形。與本市每年七月之打醮汎及新年景况爲大同小異。小販生意。乃爲之利市十倍焉。</p>

<p>上月二十五日愛文義路郭宅一宵慘殺七命。誠海上空前之慘劇。予與郭姓世交。耳聞目睹。或較外界眞切。特草此稿。閲者幸勿以普通文字視之。要知此稿背景。皆斑斑血涙也。</p>
<p>怕見小狗郭氏長女卜居法租界。月前購得一小狗。擬奉母玩。慘事發生前一夕。伊母偕現認爲兇手之郭崧安飯女家。崧安善相犬。衆請其評判。彼則提狗頸二次。查騐各部并檢雌雄時。予亦在塲。孰知翌晚大禍驟發。今則家有均怕見斯狗。蓋觸景生情。反多悲感。更恐因狗而聨念及當時兇手之神氣也。</p>
<p>養虎傷身逃婢崇桂。本非郭宅養。民國十四年。郭媳劉雁秋產長子蘇生彌月期。劉母由澳門携滬。因伴蘇生居郭宅。該婢幼年全家遭匪難。父母被害。旋劉宅主人權中啣命勦匪。救是婢於虎穴。婢以孤苦零仃。形單影隻。遂寄養於劉。全家咸善視之。不意空前大禍。即由伊而生。鳴呼。養虎傷身。自古已然。爲之奈何。</p>
<p>人亡書到被害七人中。有長幼二婢。長名春蓮。死狀最慘。面頸呈刀痕外。又斷左手。大槪行凶時抵抗所致。當其生前。曾向月光公司索閲「時裝指南。」因恐他婢爭讀。易名寄敦戚家。同時作書知照郭戚。其用心良苦。詎料書到之日。正該婢橫尸之時。哀哉。</p>
<p>死不瞑目郭母黎琼瑗及伊媳。均温良賢德。去歲長女字人。郭母乃卸治家之職。事無大小。悉付諸媳。已則焚香點燭茹素禮佛。或敎婢讀書習字。弄孫飼畜耳。知者僉認爲模範家長。而今亦不得善終。泉下有知。吾知其死亦不瞑目也。</p>

<p>初八。在國語學校演講。有福建柯達文君專來爲國語統一運動。余極贊成之。因此間有一種大障碍。即小團體多而不能統一。要以各帮爲主。各辦其學校。遇事難大集合。此亦國語不通有以分其勢也。而余以爲此地寺廟百餘。若令無事僧人。先學國語。一致運動。每禮拜講演。並敎平民識字。則不數年。不但提高華人文化。且可傳佛敎於土人。豈非甚善事。惜哉僧人多不識字。又不通佛爲何物。少數僧只念佛拜像。以博得不識字女人之布施而已。哀哉。余因思天主敎本拜偶像與僧人正同。自路德改爲毁廟去像。居士傳敎以一僧聚尼MartinLutherMarriedCathrineBira包拉者。遂與今之耶敎。用科學方法而與社會接近。因無偶像可守。牧師及牧師夫人必須用科學向社會活動。而建設與人類同化之社會。而僧人因有廟像可看守。以賺人自然送來之布施。遂懶惰不復問世。釀成麻醉之迷信敎。廟像之有害谥佛法發展。故有像法須滅之言與。百文立叢林制。本以敎化徒衆。而今之不進步亦以此。蓋天下利弊相生。誠未易論也。</p>
<p>初九余近欲研究此地之數種奇俗。一此地極熱而人多戴呢帽。即上海人冬天所戴者。二人拿扇者甚少。三粤俗。客人至。甚少用水盆及手巾以應客者。此間亦然。四此地旣熱。飲茶水爲甚要事。而此地人到處皆用極小之茶碗。略如酒杯大以供客。飲已又倒。太不經濟時間。余甚以此四事爲奇。而久研究不得其故。後乃覺得人少拿扇者。因坡地風甚多。日夜不斷故與。但若到小店内。終覺熱。應亦乏提倡之故。市上亦不少賣扇者。然人少用之。土人告我曰。生於熱者。不知熱也。君過慮耳。用小杯飲茶之習慣。乃考而知之。由來閩人甚考究品茶。敬客者用小壼置一磁盤内。加以兩小杯。均極精緻。乃其壼與盤杯。俱每人一壼二杯。可自斟而飲，故不覺其費。久之成爲公衆一壼之用小杯斟飲。則太笨矣。此以訛傳訛。而成大不便之事也。此品茶之俗。甚爲貴重。日本即學福建人也。但有一趣事。即品茶成癖。亦足以亡身家。甚於雅片烟。因有茶癮者。其用茶甚貴重須數元一兩之茶葉。且日夜聚友而飲之。以致有傾萬金之家者。亦可笑也。天十事任何事皆不可過度。故孔子講中庸。雅理士多德講中道GoldMean也。然今人無責茶。仍用貴茶式小茶杯則大謬矣。且其磁非江西產。杯亦惡劣亟宜改良。其天甚熱而不興用巾供客。或云怕傳染。因粤俗畏麻瘋症。然我總認爲神經過敏。友人久於此者。曰成習慣亦不覺也。不過有一好處。此間因有風。坐稍時汗即止。惟熱帶戴呢帽一事。不可解。然余旣至此地。亦只好戴之。因遍地無草帽也。至西人則帶厚而白之帽云。總之以上四事皆應改革。一戴呢帽應改草帽。二應拿扇。三應以水巾供客。四飲茶必須用大杯。須用運動方法行之。庶幾乎可矣。</p>
<p>吸菸。而紙捲(即紙吹)適告罄。且因時値夜午。無處購覓。公子怒。探懷出十元紙幣數紙。捲而代之燃以吸菸。且顧盼以示豪華。旁觀爲之側目。</p>
<p>自鈔票發行後。吾人以其輕巧便於携帶。故授受之間。實利用之。迺彼鄕愚思想簡單。凡遇交易。必需現洋。泰半不願受紙幣。且嘗聞若輩更有謂吾城市中使用紙幣者。目爲鬼籙中人等語。謬妄若此。寗不可笑。</p>
<p>鈔票之上。每見游手好閒之輩。胡亂塗鴉。見之生厭。然亦有詩歌警句等。題咏於票之邊緣空白處。諷譏怒駡。發揮靡遺。第阿堵薄情。固亦不容諱飾。自無怪寒士之抱怨也。</p>

<p>自國際金價暴漲後吾國金融界、即引起極大恐慌、財部工商部對此紛紛設法救濟、迄尙未有一切實辦法、現經濟學家徐佩琨君、對此問題、發表救濟意見、徐君爲中央大學商學院敎授、對經濟問題、甚有心得、特爲發表意見如下、</p>
<p>晚近滬埠銀匯暴跌國人受創之深除内戰復發而外、無有更甚者矣、銀匯暴跌、影響於商界者甚鉅、然一般消費者與無辜之民、亦無不蒙重大之犧牲、蓋禍之所及、池魚難以倖免也、甚者中國之經濟組織、且將因此而致　毁、不然、亦僅予以一線恢復之機會、許其苟延殘喘而已，際此千鈞一髪危急之秋、國内銀行家經濟學家新聞記者政府官員、舉凡一般關心時事者、莫不趨於一致究察此次風潮之眞相、反復討論、共謀所以拯救之策焉、余細察此次風潮之發生、自始即倡言、銀匯暴跌、半由於我國幣制之紛亂、半由於金業交易所之不法操縱、（請參閲商業雜誌正月二十五號第二十九頁）故拯救之方、主張以禁止現銀進口、並同時禁止標金投機爲歸、更白另一方面言、我國銀價之應保障、事實上實有不得不然者、蓋國内持有大宗銀貨者之利益、以及其他財產之以銀價計値者、皆不能因銀價暴跌、而不加以保障故也至於金本位問題、著者深知在最近數年内、中國尙未有採用之準備、即使中國已採用金本位制、則在最近數年内、我國仍有匯價漲落過巨之問題、須加對付、同時、又須設法維持國内大宗銀貨之價値、故金本位政策、非拯救目前風潮之良策、而况金本位議案、自身又爲一問題者乎、自著者上項意見發表後、經濟學銀行家之起而與著公同建議現銀進口禁令、或他項之進口限制者、不乏其人、嗣後雖有非議者、然大抵有文無質、絶無理由與根據之議論、固無需加以糾正焉、在本文以内、著者即將其前項意見、作更進一步之申述、而冀外問徧妄議論之歸於同滅也、</p>
<p>（乙）金貴銀賤觀點錯誤之由來</p>
<p>此次中國財政史上空前未有之劇變、學者頗多被其迷惑、而滋生混淆與誤解、甚者且謂銀價旣　一種世界的景象、拯救之方、自須由有關係各國共同協定謀一解决之方法、爲求其説之勁健、又引供求定律爲證、謂近年來銀之產額增加頗速、而銀之需求、則因印度安南相繼採用金本位制、故減縮甚著又有一派、則主張上海銀匯之平價、常依倫敦銀價爲基礎、其計算方式如下、「假令今日倫敦即期大條銀爲一先令十辨士、則理論上滬埠之平價爲22X1·175‖25·85d·」，因之、該派即謂中國銀價、即由倫敦大條銀價所定、中國無節制銀價之可能、</p>
<p>標金之影響上述各説無寗過於推諉、蓋自彼輩言之、則此次風潮、中國本身全無補救之方、如此、則與聽天由命何異也、我人試將上説稍加思索、即可知其所以有此錯誤者、全由於彼輩之未能認識此次銀匯暴跌之眞正原因、有以致之、所可奇者、學者多被一錯誤之起點所誤因遂汨没於一空洞理想之中、而不知本問題之　結、乃潛存於標金價格之伸縮、因標金價格之伸縮、而生上海銀匯之劇變、我人爲求明瞭本問題之眞相起見、必先切實認識此次風潮純屬匯兑風潮、對於滬埠標金之消長、有密切關係者也(一)供求定律之適用問題、第一、我人須知、供求定律、不能濫用、引用該定律之前、必先綢察、一問題之性質及其適用原理之類制、由此觀之即知供求定律並非無往而不適用者、當某物需求增加之時、其價格不定隨之俱增、有時仍依原價或竟跌落、此琿甚屬淺顯、蓋在大量生產情狀下、每單位物品之生產成本、往往因此而減低也、反之當某物需求減少之時、其價格亦有因生產成本之增高或他項犧牲之發生、不隨需求減少而降低、再自供給方面言、我人亦可説明、物品之稀少、不即能提高物價、蓋當某物價格過高時、人人可購用他物以替代之也、且物之稀少者、或即係物之半不合時用者、因其半不合時用也故其售價只能低廉、藉以補償一部份已失效用之損失、再當一物供給過於豐富時、其價格不定即時下降、蓋此物雖多仍、可將其改製他項消費物、或將其暫時儲存、以待異時異地之用、上所云云、即係供求定律之限制、談原理者不可不察、更不可不知談物價漲落之時所應用者、係一價格原理、而非僅僅一供求定律也、(未完)</p>

<h3 id="c181">現代丹麥文學 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>趙景深在復旦大學講</p>
<p>湯增歇陳夑　筆記</p>
<p>我的講題本來是、一現代的斯干底那亞文學、包羅丹麥·挪威·瑞典三國的文字、那樣的範圍比較大些·現在因爲時間的問題、先單講丹麥文學、其餘的有機會時、可繼續來講、</p>
<p>我所講的「現代丹麥文學」、是從一九○○年起至現在爲止（tgoooydeent)、我國人對於丹麥文學、向來不大注意、也很少聽人家説起、而最熟悉的也只有三個人、一是安徒生(HCAnptesen)是世界上著名的童話家、還有一個是勃蘭特(G·raude、s)是著名的批評家、此外譯成中文有單行本的還有一位「兩條腿」和「十二姊妹」的作者「愛華耳特」(Ewaed)、我國有李小峰先生和袁家驊先生的譯本、關於丹麥文學、除這三人之外别的似乎是很生疎了、我現在要向諸位講的、是二十世紀人丹麥文學、而不是十九世紀的丹麥文學、</p>
<p>丹麥文學、在十九世紀的時候、就有了很偉大的成績、例如勃蘭特、不僅給丹麥人以很大的光榮、而且挪威瑞典和世界各國也受了很大的影響、至於丹麥現代的文學、常是國際思想的新潮、在斯干底那亞半鳬有很重要的地位、是輸入新潮的溝渠、</p>
<p>丹麥文學、可分三方面來講、</p>
<p>（甲）小説</p>
<p>在丹麥的小説方面、產生了一大派人物、他們都是約特蘭（jutlahd）人、所以他們稱爲約特蘭派(Jutlandess)、他們的文學運動、便稱爲約特蘭運動)JutandMouement)、</p>
<p>約特蘭因爲在世界的北邊、三面臨着大海、天氣非常地冷、人民的職業也是以耕種捕魚居多、他們很能發展鄕土的本性、把風土人情詳詳細細地描寫出來、所以他們的作品中Soilofsoil的氣息是非常地濃厚、</p>
<p>晉生LohannesXJensen，I873）生於一九七三年、他的父親學習獸醫、祖父是一個織工、先祖則是農民、因此、晉生的作品和人生觀、也跳不出風土情和大自然這一類的對象、他在一八九六年作了一本「丹麥人」、一八九八年EmerElkar、他的作品受JobannesIoroensen的影響最深、他在一九○四年至一九○五年這幾年間、游覽美洲之後、又作了幾部　　小説　　　　　　　出　　　　　者的　　　　　生　　　　正　接受外來的影響、他的作品在思想納　方　是新奇、表現也極　　、取材方面多是過去現在、和人生與大自然的對象、作品中滿含着幽默和悲哀的情緒、到後來又著了許多書、思想也漸漸穩定起來、晋生的思想主要的元素是在發揚他哥特種的精神、同時他在科學上則很相信達爾文(Darwin)的進化論、有人説晉生的進化論是文人的進化論、是没有生命的、關於進化論、他在一九二五年作了一本「進化與道德」、一九二七年作「動物的變形」、雖然描寫不免於荒唐、虚空但也算是他自已發表了一種「進化論」、晉生在一九○○｜一九○一兩年間、作了國王的失敗、書中的主人翁是丹麥王ClouskianII在政治上的失敗、寫美國有奥拉D、ork「夫人」「東輪」(一九○四一九○五年)頗有偵探效果寫遠東的有「新嘉波故事」(一九○七)等、這時寫景方面、已有了很大的進步、他之所以爲寫英美和丹麥地方的小説的緣故、是由於哥特種是由英美和丹麥合成的、晉生的著作不獨在丹麥享有盛名、而且是北歐文學界中一個代表、他的小説多有十餘萬言、而以種族史詩似的小説最爲著名、他的六部小説(一)「失去的國王」(一九一九)、(二)「冰河」(以上二書英譯合名「火與冰」)、(三)「運命女神的客」(一九一九)、「卒伯利人的足跡」(一九二二)(五)「船」(一九一二)、(「六哥倫布」(一九二一)、他的作書和Ba</p>
<p>zoc一樣的深思苦作時間是很慢的、一部巨著的成功並不是一二年的事、他這部史詩似的小説可分做四期、（一）冰河時代、（二）種族移居時代、（三）海盜時代、（四）發現美洲時代、冰河時代是在種族移居的時候、他所寫的是一個神話故事、古代天上有冰雹雷雨、大地上的人都被打死了、這時只洛着一個人、他拚命向北面衝去、途中遇到一個女子、這人快活極了、後來和這女子發生了戀愛、這是第一二本書中的事、後來這男的不滿意於目前的環境、於是發現了他的新的計劃、飄流到一個海島上去居住、爲後來生了許許多多的丹麥人的後裔、一直到了發現美洲的時代、他的六部小説、在量上是有着和屠格湼夫一樣的企圖、此後還寫了五本「神話」（一九○七｜一九二四）、Jorgine（一九二六、（又有三部詩集、「詩」（一九○六）「四季」（一九二三）和「世界之光」（一九二六）、散文方面、有「新世界」（一九○七）「北人之心」（一九一二）「我們時代的前導」（一九一五）等書、</p>
<p>克納生（JakohKunhsehI858I9I7）善於寫鄕土風俗、農民私塾先生的生活、也是丹麥一個soil的作家、克納生也曾發表過自已對於哲學和宗敎的思想、他開始作文章的時候很遲、約略四十歲的時候了、少年時代曾作過鄕間小學的敎師、他一生最後的二十年、專從事講演著作、他的「人生哲學」、可以看出他的思想、他又是一個宗敎革命家、他不滿意於當時的宗敎、抱有改革的主見、一九一二作「恐怖」、一九一四年作「勇敢」、是寫路德敎的發展、他的作品中滿含着幽默和嘲笑、他的作品大都是主觀的、常藉小説中的人物宣揚他自已的思想、不過他的思想是反對新思潮、丹麥現代文人恐怕要算他最奮了、</p>

<p>第三十八章十九世紀蘭法西的散文</p>
<p>莫泊桑仗了言語和思想的經濟造出他的效果來、自然主義或寫實主義者的最多產的人厄密力·左拉則將細碎的事項堆積起來、全然是仗了重量得到他的效果的、比起他、來連巴爾扎克也似乎簡潔而各嗇、而莫泊桑不過是骸骨罷了左拉的小説以其集成底力而言是偉大的、一切生活都被結集於其中、竟致讀者幾乎　饜於生活這東西、情願那里没有這許多的生活、左拉没有最優的法蘭西的蠱惑力和雅致、而法蘭西批評壇以鋭利的辛辣處理他在凡有左拉的作品中並無什麽傑作、或什麽珠玉然而要從他那無數的作品中挑選兩三篇、則我們可以舉出「娜娜」「瓦解」和「土」來、這幾種及其他許多種已經翻譯爲英語了、因爲他的力在其内容、不在特殊的文體的魔術、　　下接第九版</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<h2>Page 25</h2>
<p>所以他在譯本中幾乎没有什麽損失、左拉的批評家以過於偏重醜陋奇怪淫猥的東西（而他的小説是無可否定的證　）這一種過失非難他然而他的人生觀並非不健全的、不過單是記述痛苦的徵候的醫師或將世界的錯誤告知我們而希望其改良的社會改革家的人生觀罷了、他那最初成功的作品「酒店」是反對酒精的偉大的傳道文左拉的目的的誠實决没有什麽疑問、他的性格的高貴爲德雷福事件中他的勇敢的戰鬭所證明、那事件是使他在死後成爲國民底英雄的、</p>
<p>在左拉的墳墓作演説的是儘兩個法蘭西人所能相異的限度和左拉相異的人物阿那托爾法蘭西法蘭西、先生將本國的名用爲他的文學上的名、（這實際是他）的父的名、弗朗沙的縮形、）而對於這名、誰也不能有更超越的權利、他是獨創底·獨立底·在怪僻的安全方面涉着遐想、可是他那怪僻的精神却包括着法蘭西傳統的最優的東西、假如我們　有他的書、則我們似乎也就能從那些書　學得他的國他的時代·以及取最完成的形的法蘭西語罷、什麽生活的樣相、他不是以鋒鋭·剛健明朗的懷疑主義觸着的呢、「盆京島」是諷刺底的文明史、約拿單·斯尉夫特·該見此而笑、福耳特耳該對優於自已的人物致敬罷、彙集而稱爲「現代的歷史」的四篇小説是寫實主義、有着一片光芒「西　德·波那特的罪、」是羅曼斯有着淚和微笑、他遇着種種的大問題時、是同他的朋友左拉一樣地眞摰而熱情底的、而且使單純的學究辟易似的博學的重　　荷、他負在他那聳着的肩上輕易似地運行、他的思想往往是革命底的、他的文體則純粹而簡樸、他憎惡欺詐和僞善、但他的憎惡却是温和·冷嘲·哲學底的、决不因憤激而暴躁、他的天才是批評底·穿鑿底、他的小説是傳達着他的思想和意見的、運用得靈巧的傢伙、</p>
<p>十九世紀是法蘭西散文最豐富的時代之一、小説和批評在質和量上都非常興旺、即使没有傑出的巨匠、近代的法蘭西也有着偉大的散文文學的罷、在有才能的人物羣集的世紀中、要説出傑出的是誰來、是困難的、恐怕也没有説的必要、這困難當説到主材服從於在公衆的趣味、在批評家的判斷上急速的動搖的小説時、尤其是困惑的、雖然這也没有使我們煩惱的必要、</p>
<p>和時一起增加聲價上去的一個天才人是亨里培爾、照他所自稱、則是斯通達爾、他的小説「紅和黑」及「派爾謨的修道院」在人物的分析上是可注目的、這些在同世紀的前半發表、但至斯通達爾的死後爲止、不曾給人怎麽大的印象、巴爾札</p>
<p>克理解他的價値、而後代的法蘭西作家是認識他的影響、稱掦他的天才的、近代批評家的最壯麗者里米杜哥爾蒙將他看作試金石、如果我們不喜歡他、則我們可説是不屬於「幸福的少數者」有理解的被選者的了</p>
<p>寫過爲幸福的多數者所有的小説的作者是普洛恩剖美里美、他的科西嘉島的故事「哥倫白」是内容刺　底的同美里美别的作品的作風一樣、以古典底地明澈的、同時還充滿詩底色彩的文體寫出的完全的故事、他的「嘉爾　」有着對於不朽性的二重的權利、爲什麽呢、因爲這是比最的不朽的阿配拉的臺本的資料、</p>
<p>有幾分恰當地被稱爲法蘭西的迭更司的亞豐瑣杜德、以他的哀感和諧謔、他那對於各類的人們、特是爲生所苛待的人們的由衷的同情而言、是像英吉利的巨匠的、在這方面、同酷似着迭更司一樣、他也酷似着微克忒囂俄、最初使他成名的小説「大福羅蒙忒和小列思婁」充滿着寛大的温和、而從可嫌的感傷性解放、就使他愈益保持公衆的愛的續出的書而言也如此、他的文體（及大槪他的人間這東西）的蠱惑力博得左拉、福羅貝爾·厄特蒙·杜龔古爾等、懷着較之他的人生觀遠過批評底·分析底的人生觀的作家的尊敬、他屬於自然主義派、又屬於刺柏雷一派笑謔家及詼諧家、他的「泰拉思孔的泰泰　」是文學上最優的戲謔之一、</p>

There must be a country before there can be a home. One must embrace the principle of sacrifice and have the resolve to die in battle in order to defeat the enemy. The words were mostly encouraging. After the speech, the assembly dispersed, nearing 5 p.m. The division's rifles, cannons, flags, and uniforms were all bright and new. Their spirit and courage were all energetic and vigorous. Chiang personally wrote the oath of allegiance, which had been printed using the collotype process.

<h3 id="e20">Today's Disputes in the World <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Today's disputes in the world can be summarized in just two phrases. What was given up before is now wanted back. What was fortunately obtained before is regarded as inherent. One side wants to take it back, while the other side regards it as inherent and refuses to let others take it back. Thus, between the two sides, conflict is inevitable. This is why Gandhi of India was arrested.</p>
<p>The situation is the same between colonies and invading countries. The situation is also the same between weak and powerful countries in the international arena. The situation is also the same between those who have political power and those who do not in a country. The situation is also the same between those who have power and those who do not in society. Therefore, in the world today, all the various disputes are no different.</p>
<p>Human greed is insatiable. Many can speak of justice, but few can practice it. Once the rights of others are seized by force, they are regarded as rightfully obtained and will never be lightly returned. Even when sometimes compelled by circumstances to show some intention of returning them, it is always lip service and never materializes. They say either the time is not ripe or the level is not sufficient. They will never give up until the other party fights with all their might. Therefore, those who are on the powerful side today are all encouraging contention. In that case, how can there ever be a day of peace in the world?</p>

<p>All Shops in Mumbai Strike</p>
<p>Armed Military Police on High Alert</p>
<p>Major Blow to Anti-British Movement</p>
<p>Bloodshed Imminent</p>
<p>Reuters, Geraldpo, May 5: The well-known leader of the Indian Nationalist Party, Gandhi, was arrested this morning.</p>
<p>Reuters, Mumbai, May 5: Gandhi was taken to Bolifli, near Mumbai, where he got off the train and was escorted by military police to an unknown location.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geraldpo, May 5: The county magistrate, police chief, and dozens of armed police officers arrived at Gandhi's residence late at night. At that time, all was quiet, and Gandhi was already asleep. The crowd held up torches to illuminate him, and Gandhi was awakened, asking, "Do you want to arrest me?" The county magistrate said, "We are ordered to arrest you." Gandhi replied, "May I rinse my mouth?" The crowd agreed. Gandhi then performed his heavy Indian ceremony with salt. After finishing, he took out a letter from the upper Indian governor from his arms and gave it to one of his followers (at which time all the followers gathered). Then he said goodbye to the volunteers, carrying a spinning wheel and followed the crowd.</p>
<p>Reuters, Mumbai, May 5: Due to Gandhi's arrest, all Hindu shops and more than half of Muslim shops here are closed today. The Grain Exchange and Cottonseed Exchange have ceased trading. Two detachments of the East Lancashire Brigade are stationed in the center of the yarn factory area and the police headquarters, and commercial groups are patrolling the streets in cars.</p>
<p>Reuters, Pune, May 5: Three police cars, one carrying Gandhi and his guards, arrived at Yerwada Prison this morning at 11 a.m. Gandhi told a Reuters reporter that the police authorities had made careful arrangements, and the journey was very comfortable. He was genuinely moved. It is heard that the government plans to allow Gandhi 100 rupees per month for food expenses and also plans to provide food subsidies to Gandhi's subordinates. Before Gandhi set off, he was examined by Colonel Thomas, a Mumbai government doctor, who said that he was fit for a long journey. Thus, the crowd dared to leave.</p>
<p>Reuters, Mumbai, May 5: Gandhi's arrest warrant stated that the government, in view of Gandhi's activities, was very alarmed and would impose a ban in accordance with Article 25 of the 1827 regulations and detain him in Yerwada Prison in Pune. The duration will be determined by the government. After receiving the news, the Nationalist Party immediately rang bells everywhere to announce Gandhi's arrest and also propagated to the public at the street intersections, urging them to strike for the next two days and participate in the rally to be held tonight. The place where Gandhi was arrested was Gadati near Geraldpo, half an hour past midnight. Gandhi was placed in a special dining car. When he arrived in Ahmedabad, the dining car was transferred to the back of the Gujarati mail train and headed towards Mumbai. This morning at 6:30 a.m., the car arrived at Bolifli station, 23 miles outside Mumbai. Three European police officers and three Indian police officers escorted Gandhi off the car and placed him in a car prepared by the police station. This morning at 10 a.m., the news of Gandhi's arrest spread throughout Mumbai. The authorities have taken special precautions. It is heard that in the event of riots, the regular army and auxiliary teams can be dispatched. European employees have been provided with military weapons by the authorities for use in emergencies.</p>
<p>Reuters, Mumbai, May 5: The Mumbai government issued a bulletin listing the course of non-violent resistance, continuing that this movement has caused widespread lawlessness and disturbances of public order throughout India. Facts have proven that the laws of the world are immutable. If Gandhi's movement is not prohibited, it will repeat the history of the initial non-cooperation movement and cause bloodshed. Therefore, the Mumbai government and the Indian government, after careful consultation, decided that Gandhi cannot be tolerated any longer.</p>
<p>Reuters, Pune, May 4: An explosion occurred in the Kogi area today, injuring six Indians, two of whom were seriously injured. The crowd believes that Indians who are employed in the local armory have contacted people outside the factory to steal explosives and transport them out, but they accidentally exploded on the way. The injured have now been admitted to the hospital, and important events may be discovered within days.</p>

<p>British Major Nearly Injured</p>
<p>Reuters, South Africa, Weicester, May 5: Major Thomas, head of the Criminal Investigation Department of Cape Town, came here to investigate a case committed by natives. He arrested a native because he had previously seen the native with live ammunition in a rifle at a meeting of the African National Congress. Two detectives first took the native away by car, and Mr. Thomas and another detective followed. Suddenly, the crowd pelted them with stones, and they were nearly injured. The natives then fought each other. Before long, 19 policemen arrived. One of them was stabbed and fell to the ground while trying to arrest someone. The perpetrator was shot and killed on the spot. Then, Captain Bart, the police chief, fell after being hit by an axe. Major Thomas shot the axe-wielder. At that moment, a woman rushed up and slashed Thomas's throat with a knife. The police quickly opened fire to protect him, but were eventually forced to retreat. Four natives died and 15 were injured in the battle, and two police officers were injured. The police chief was also seriously injured. Afterwards, many women were crying in the field, looking for their loved ones among the dead and injured. Cape Town has sent 50 armed police to suppress the situation.</p>

<p>A Hastily Concluded London Treaty</p>
<p>The Five-Power Agreement and the Three-Power Pact</p>
<p>Limitations on Auxiliary Vessels for Britain, America, and Japan</p>
<p>Holiday for Battleship Construction</p>
<p>The Perilous Situation in the Mediterranean</p>
<p>The London Naval Conference, from its opening to the present, has lasted more than eighty days, experiencing numerous twists and turns, and was on the verge of collapse several times. Until the very last minute, to preserve the dignity of the governments of various countries and avoid attacks from opposition public opinion, the great powers finally reached a partial agreement. The heavily promoted naval conference was thus hastily concluded.</p>
<p>The Five-Power Naval Conference held its final plenary session yesterday (April 14th), concluding more than two months of negotiations. Now it only remains to draft the full text of the treaty, and the articles can be signed on the 22nd or 23rd of this month. The final result of the conference is that only an agreement between Britain, the United States, and Japan has been reached. The disputes among Britain, France, and Italy in Europe have not been resolved at all. However, to save face and avoid a breakdown, the naval agreement is divided into two parts, one to be signed only by Britain, the United States, and Japan, and the other to be signed jointly by Britain, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy.</p>
<p>The full text of the treaty established by the London Conference will only be fully announced after it is signed by the various countries. Based on what we currently know, its content is roughly as follows: The full text of the treaty is divided into three parts. The first part is to be signed jointly by the five countries, and includes the following articles: (1) It stipulates the postponement of battleship replacements. Based on the Washington Treaty, countries can replace battleships that have reached the end of their service life. Now it is agreed that, except for exceptions, countries will generally not replace their battleship fleets before 1936. This is the so-called "Naval Holiday." Therefore, the battleships that Britain, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy plan to build within five years will all be suspended. (2) The Washington Conference stipulated the limitation of aircraft carriers to a maximum of 10,000 tons. This conference also agreed to limit even those under 10,000 tons. In addition, it stipulates the method of limiting fleet tonnage, adopting a compromise between the total tonnage limit proposed by France and the classification limit proposed by Britain. (3) It stipulates which special ships can be unrestricted. In addition, it stipulates the maximum displacement tonnage of each submarine. In general, the articles contained in this first part are merely a slight expansion of the articles in the Washington Treaty that restrict battleships, and at the same time, they provide a general outline for the method of restricting auxiliary vessels for future negotiations. One of the more important items is the battleship holiday; otherwise, they are all unrelated to the actual restriction of naval forces.</p>
<p>The second part will also be signed jointly by the five countries. Its content is nothing more than two points: (1) It stipulates the restrictions on the use of submarines in wartime. (2) It stipulates the status of commercial ships in naval warfare. Although the issue of freedom of the seas, which Britain hoped for, was not raised at this conference, and the abolition of submarines, which Britain and the United States advocated, was not realized, these compromise provisions had to be made to satisfy the demands of the United States. Although this part is not related to the main text of disarmament, it does add an important new section to international law.</p>
<p>The third part involves the main purpose of this conference, namely, the quantitative limitation of auxiliary fleets. However, because Italy insisted on equality between France and Italy, and France refused to concede because Britain and the United States were unwilling to join the Mediterranean Security Pact, a common agreement could not be reached among the five countries. Only Britain, the United States, and Japan signed this part. As far as we know, Britain, the United States, and Japan agreed on the following tonnage limits for the three countries' auxiliary vessels until 1930:</p>
<p>Britain   United States  Japan</p>
<p>Cruisers with 8-inch guns  146,800   180,000  108,400</p>
<p>Cruisers with 6-inch guns  192,200   143,500  100,450</p>
<p>Destroyers  150,000   150,000  105,500</p>
<p>Submarines  52,700   52,700  52,700</p>
<p>Total Tonnage of Auxiliary Fleets  541,700   526,200  567,050</p>
<p>It can be seen from the above table that the tonnage of Britain and the United States adopts the principle of absolute equality between Britain and the United States. The reason why the total tonnage of British auxiliary vessels is slightly more than that of the United States is that the needs for cruisers are different in Britain and the United States. The tonnage of large cruisers (with 8-inch guns) in the United States is more than that in Britain, while the tonnage of small cruisers in Britain is more than that in the United States. The combat power of a cruiser with 8-inch guns is naturally superior to that of a cruiser with 6-inch guns of the same tonnage. To maintain equality, the total tonnage of Britain is allowed to slightly exceed that of the United States. As for Japan's request for 70% of the tonnage of the United States, the United States only allowed 60%. This time, a compromise solution was adopted. The large cruisers owned by Japan are 60% of those of the United States, while the small cruisers and destroyers are about 70% of those of the United States.</p>
<p>The result of this three-country agreement can temporarily stop the competition in building auxiliary vessels among Britain, the United States, and Japan in the next six years. The greatest benefit is in the financial aspect. According to the British Labour Party's newspaper DAILY HERALD, according to this three-country agreement, Britain can save 100 million pounds in naval expenses. Although the London Conference ostensibly promotes peace and humanity, its underlying purpose is nothing more than that the military expenditure burdens of various countries are too heavy, and they want to seek mutual understanding among the great powers to protect maritime hegemony at a relatively low cost and prepare for the next war. Although this conference has been on the verge of collapse many times, the governments of various countries have repeatedly tolerated and strived for its final compromise, which is also for this reason.</p>
<p>However, although the limitations on auxiliary vessels for Britain, the United States, and Japan have achieved considerable results, the fleets of France and Italy are still not subject to the slightest restriction. Although it was stated at this conference that Britain, France, and Italy would continue negotiations after the conference, paying attention to the fact that the two countries would also join the third part of the treaty and complete the five-country agreement, based on the current situation, the French and Italian governments are each taking extreme positions, and it seems that there is absolutely no possibility of compromise. Moreover, the British Navy, although it has to succumb to the principle of equality between Britain and the United States, is still unwilling to give up its absolute advantage in Europe. The British Navy must at least be equal to the combined military strength of France and Italy. If the navies of France and Italy are not restricted and expand arbitrarily, then Britain, in order to maintain its advantage in the Mediterranean, will have to continue to build naval fleets. Therefore, as far as we know, the part of the London Treaty signed by Britain, the United States, and Japan will be accompanied by a reservation clause, which states that if the naval negotiations between France and Italy are unsuccessful, the three countries will not be bound by this treaty. If so, then the so-called three-country agreement will still depend on the success or failure of the negotiations between France and Italy to determine its survival. If France and Italy continue to go their separate ways, then the London Treaty will be nothing more than a piece of paper, and the naval restrictions of Britain, the United States, and Japan will be like drawing a cake to satisfy hunger.</p>
<p>The country that benefits the most from the results of this conference is the United States. The equality of the British and American navies has been completely confirmed by this London Treaty. From now on, the British Empire will have to share half of its maritime hegemony, which it has monopolized for more than a hundred years, with the United States. The conflict between Britain and the United States can be temporarily avoided from breaking out in the next four or five years. This is indeed a great success for the Labour cabinet. However, in Europe, the confrontation between France and Italy has been further aggravated by this conference. The newspapers in Paris and Rome have openly issued challenges. The perilous situation in the Mediterranean in recent years has never been more severe than it is today. Although Britain wants to stay out of it, it cannot do so. It would be too optimistic to regard the signing of the London Treaty as a good omen for peace. (Sent from Paris on April 15)</p>

<p>The Government Is Trying Hard to Mediate</p>
<p>The Management of Military Affairs Generates Side Issues</p>
<p>The Minister of the Army Leaves the Hospital While Ill</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 5th The situation in the Upper House remains unoptimistic. Problems such as the issue of supreme command, the management of the Minister of the Army's affairs, increased educational funding, and financial unease are lying ahead. The government plans to find ways to mediate. Iron Minister Eki visited Prime Minister Hamaguchi yesterday to discuss countermeasures to the Upper House, in order to ensure that there are no omissions. Justice Minister Watanabe held a garden party at his private residence yesterday, inviting leaders of the Upper House to seek understanding.</p>

He plans to attend parliament in two or three days.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 5th Regarding the two issues of supreme command and the management of the Minister of the Army's affairs, Uizawa Soumei of the Upper House Research Association said, "No matter what cabinet, they all feel that relations with the military are thorny. Even if the government's claims are just, they often make concessions to avoid future difficulties." The Seiyukai plans to end the issue of the Minister of the Army to avoid leaving problems for the future. The Minseito plans to always whip the government for the opposition party's movement to overthrow the cabinet by taking advantage of the issue of supreme command.</p>
<p>Nichi Ren, Tokyo, 5th The bills passed by the various committees of the House of Representatives on the 5th are as follows: (1) Amendment to the Law on National Treasury Burden of Compulsory Education Expenses; (1) Export Compensation Bill; (1) Amendment to the Customs Tariff Law; (1) Amendment to the Korean Private Railway Subsidy Law; (1) Amendment to the Indemnity Special Accounting Law; (1) Each budget proposal from the First Subcommittee to the Sixth Subcommittee.</p>

As a result of consultations between the two, the scope of the debate is limited to economic issues. Matters such as being biased towards emotions or only focusing on impeaching the government and deviating from the topic must be avoided. The two sides have reached an understanding in advance.</p>

<p>American United Press, Washington, 5th Certain quarters made their final all-out attack on the new tariff bill today, making every effort to incite popular animosity towards the bill, and issued a declaration signed by more than a thousand so-called economists. The most important figures listed are professors of economics from Yale and Harvard Universities. The declaration states that all the people of the United States will be adversely affected by this bill. Farmers need not be mentioned, but exporters, peddlers, wholesalers, and unemployed people will not be spared. After the implementation of this bill, it will cause retaliatory actions by other countries, and even Americans investing abroad will eventually suffer greatly.</p>

<p>Reuters, New York, 4th According to New York Police Chief Whalen's announcement today, communist documents have been seized, proving that the Moscow Communist International is directly responsible for inciting strikes and riots in the United States. The police department is still engaged in investigating news about several communist groups, so the documents cannot be thoroughly investigated. The police chief's statement is in response to a letter from Bogdanov, the director of the Amtorg Trading Corporation, which was sent to the United States by Soviet Russia to purchase goods. The letter requested a thorough investigation of the documents and protested that Whalen's publication of the documents, along with accusations, had caused losses to the Amtorg Corporation and its branch in the United States.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Reasons for the Stock Market Crash in the United States <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>American United Press, New York, 4th According to what important figures in the financial community here have said, the real reasons for the stock market crash in New York and other cities on Friday and Saturday have not been determined, but the premonitions were revealed weeks ago. However, one of the most immediate reasons is the reports of the first quarter profits and losses of various companies. Wall Street attributes it to the various actions taken by the Central Reserve Board to remedy speculative activities. Private merchants blame the government authorities for curbing speculative transactions. Several quarters deeply believe that this crash was caused by the banking community's intentional withdrawal of financial assistance, believing that the issuance of US$300 million in indemnity bonds was a step in the right direction. According to a group of bankers, this phenomenon of price declines is actually a reaction to recent excessive purchases. In summary, there are three major reasons: (1) In order to prepare for the purchase of indemnity bonds, various banks suddenly withdrew all the funds they had released within the past three weeks. (2) Since the crash last autumn, the progress of business has been limited, while stock trading has soared, leading to this reaction. (3) The concentrated monopoly actions of a group of powerful people on Wall Street. However, this crash is completely different from the one in October last year. People generally believe that today's crash can be calmed down and there is no need for the banking community to come out and maintain it.</p>

<p>American United Press, New York, 4th New York City is the most prosperous city in the United States, with densely packed residents and numerous businesses.

<p>Generalissimo's Ninth Anniversary of Assuming the Extraordinary Presidency</p>
<p>May 5th is the ninth anniversary of the Generalissimo's assumption of the extraordinary presidency. On this day, all government agencies, businesses, and residents in the capital hung flags to celebrate. All government agencies celebrated the anniversary and also the May 5th festival in the Gregorian calendar, so they took a day off to extend the celebration. This morning, the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and various circles in Beijing held commemorative meetings separately. A summary is recorded on the left.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Central Party Headquarters <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The Central Party Headquarters held a meeting in the auditorium of the headquarters at 8:00 a.m. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Hall Arrangement In the center of the main entrance of the hall, a horizontal banner with the inscription "Ninth Anniversary of the Generalissimo's Assumption of the Extraordinary Presidential Office" was hung. On both sides were slogans: "To commemorate May 5th, we must unanimously support the Central Government, eliminate reactionary forces, and consolidate the foundation of construction," "To commemorate May 5th, we must strive to support the government, vigorously implement revolutionary diplomacy, and abolish unequal treaties." In the center outside the hall, the eight characters "Continue the Generalissimo's Spirit of Struggle" were hung. On both sides were slogans: "The Generalissimo assumed the extraordinary presidential office to resist the dark forces," "The Generalissimo assumed the extraordinary presidential office to consolidate the foundation of the revolution." In the center of the speaker's platform inside the hall, the Generalissimo's portrait, will, and the party and national flags were hung. Above it was a horizontal plaque with the inscription "May 5th is the Day of the Republic of China's Re-commemoration." On both sides were slogans: "May 5th is the day the Generalissimo reorganized the revolutionary ranks and fought against all counter-revolutionary forces," "May 5th is the day the Republic of China obtained a path of light from the heavy dark forces." Attendees Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Hanmin, Tan Yankai, Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Wu Jingheng, Gu Yingfen, Zhu Peide, Chen Lifu, Jiao Yitang, Shao Lizi, Zhou Qigang, Li Wenfan, Yu Jingtang, Enhe Batu, Liu Luyin, Ding Chao Wu, Chen Zhaoying, and representatives from government departments, ministries, and commissions, approximately 500+ people.</p>
<p>Meeting Situation The meeting opened at around 8:00 a.m., presided over by Wu Zhihui. After leading the salute, the chairman delivered the opening remarks, followed by a speech by Hu Hanmin. Then the Generalissimo Memorial Week was held, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Wu Zhihui's opening remarks briefly stated, "Today is the anniversary of the Generalissimo's assumption of the extraordinary presidency, which is also the anniversary of the Generalissimo's second assumption of the presidency. When we celebrate here today, we must know that the Generalissimo's heart was actually very painful at the time, because any title was not in the Generalissimo's heart. His lifelong goal was to achieve his doctrine. As the world was muddled, the Generalissimo knew that he could not be polite, so he became the first to know and perceive and assumed this title, and recognized it as an obligation with no rights to speak of. Observing his resignation after his first assumption of the presidency, he felt that since the Republic of China had been established, Yuan Shikai could be given a try, so he resigned. The resignation at that time was not what people today call politeness. It was truly because the Qing Dynasty had been overthrown and part of the goal of the revolution had been achieved. Who knew that after Yuan's administration, the national affairs became increasingly decadent. The autocracy of the warlords and the corruption of the bureaucrats were no different from the imperial era. The revolution was to be restarted. Various parties felt that without a title, no one seemed to be responsible, and foreigners especially found it strange and did not know what to do. The Generalissimo therefore assumed the position of extraordinary president at the request of various parties. When he took office, the celebration of the people of Guangzhou was wildly enthusiastic. Three to five hundred days later, I went to say goodbye as I was about to go to France. At that time, I saw Mr. Sun Yat-sen, who was still the same as usual. Foreigners also thought it strange that the Generalissimo did not announce a large number of officials immediately after assuming the extraordinary presidency. The Generalissimo only told me at that time about the trends in diplomacy and instructed me to explain our country's situation to foreigners whenever there was an opportunity, so that they would all understand. Therefore, when the Northern Expedition began in 1924, foreigners all understood the truth, and we no longer needed to use various titles. The Generalissimo only knew how to sacrifice himself to achieve the realization of his revolutionary doctrine, unlike Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, who used the name of revolution to achieve their personal rights and purposes. The Generalissimo's personality has always been consistent. His established policy of alliance with Russia also took nationalism as the starting point of the revolution, and the complete realization of the principle of people's livelihood as the ending point. In the future, when the world truly achieves great harmony, communism can certainly be practiced, but now is not the time. The reason for uniting with Russia is to use the Three Principles of the People to melt Soviet Russia and make it a proper path. Later, the Communist Party wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to destroy our party, which was not originally expected. Some people therefore blame the Generalissimo, but they do not know the Generalissimo's heart. Recently, Ge and Feng betrayed us. These two people can be called a goblin and a monster. Wang Jingwei was created by the Generalissimo with his own hands, but he has now been infected with demonic energy. Judging from the fact that he has not yet gone to the north to mix with them, it seems that the infection is not yet deep. I remember when Feng's wife, Li Dequan, came to Shanghai in 1927 for Mr. Chiang's marriage issue. At that time, I met Wang Jingwei, Chen Bijun, etc., and spoke of Feng's hard work, which seemed to be workable. Wang Chen jointly denounced Feng as a monster who only cheated people of their wealth. The words are still in my ears, and it is clear that the rumors about Wang Feng are untrustworthy. As for Yan Xishan, he once declared to the people that he would use courtesy to govern the country. Why does he suddenly want to organize a government now? The Generalissimo assumed the extraordinary presidency because he had no choice. Yan, on the other hand, advocates organizing a government by using courtesy to govern the country. What is the difference between the wise and the unworthy, and the contradiction? We are now manufacturing demon-revealing mirrors and monster-collecting bottles and will never easily fall into their trap. Given a considerable period of time, we are not worried that they will not show their true colors one by one. At that time, monsters or goblins may be able to hide in the mountains or flee abroad, but goblins must enter our bottles. On this day of commemorating the Generalissimo, old things feel new, and a lot of witty remarks are gathered for a while. Fortunately, it is a time of celebration, so there should be nothing wrong."</p>
<p>Hu Hanmin's speech briefly stated, "The Generalissimo has devoted himself to the national revolution for 40 years as if it were one day. He only knows how to advocate doctrine and does not have ideas about power and position. In the 1920s, in view of the corruption and incompetence of the northern warlord government, internal waste and diplomatic failures, and the national lifeline being on the verge of collapse, the Generalissimo, in order to save the situation and consolidate the foundation of the revolution, resolutely took the extraordinary presidency today nine years ago, using the name of power and position to raise his status, so as to avoid various difficulties internally and externally and to take full responsibility for important political responsibilities. After taking office, he completely took the revolution as his will, recognizing that his position in this position was only part of the revolutionary work and a page in future revolutionary history, and did not regard it as any glory. He neither expanded the organization nor increased expenses. Once the foundation was established, he carried out the Northern Expedition. He went through hardships and difficulties. Although there were warlords and imperialists who had long colluded with each other to destroy the success of the national revolution, and all reactionary forces were divided and independent, and enemies of the revolution, the Generalissimo, with a spirit of fearlessness, has been fighting against the warlord government to unify and build the country. Now China is fortunately unified and is following the Generalissimo's teachings to carry out political training and construction. The current National Government is the Generalissimo's legacy and the crystallization of the revolution. Yan and Feng are remnants of warlords and targets of the revolution. Because they want to fulfill their feudal dreams, they dare to be brazen, raise troops, and betray the revolution. Originally, revolution and warlords are incompatible, and their betrayal of the country and the party is not surprising. How can the people who have always been believers of the Generalissimo and have assisted the Generalissimo in creating the revolution for the longest time be willing to lose their reputation, combine with traitors, try to split the country, harm the people, and destroy the Generalissimo's legacy? It is lamentable and painful. I hope that the comrades of our party and the people of the whole country will recognize right and wrong, obey and disobey, fight unanimously, eliminate the rebellion, and stabilize the overall situation." After the meeting, the Generalissimo Memorial Week was held, still presided over by Wu Jingheng. He gave a detailed explanation of the comparison between phonetic symbols and letters of various countries, and the explanation of spelling and teaching methods was extremely detailed. Then the music was played, and the ceremony was completed.</p>
<h3 id="e49">National Government <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The National Government held a meeting at the auditorium at 10:30 am, the circumstances were as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: Chiang Kai-shek, Tan Yankai, Hu Hanmin, Wang Chonghui, Sun Ke, Gu Yingfen, Yang Shuzhuang, Chen Yi, Zhou Yawei, Zhang Huichang, Zhang Nanxian, Zhu Lühe, Li Zhonggong, Enhe Batu, Yi Peiji, Qin Hua, Zhang Wohua, Chen Shaokuan, Jiang Menglin, Chen Yu, Jiao Yitang, Wu Siyu, Zhang Fengjiu, and representatives of various agencies, civil servants of the National Government, military officers from both departments, totaling over five hundred people.</p>
<p>Meeting proceedings: The meeting commenced with music at 10:30 am. After leading the attendees in paying respects, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek took the stage to report on the significance of the commemoration. The ceremony concluded with music at 11:00 am and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's address: Comrades, today we commemorate the day when our Premier assumed the position of Extraordinary President in Guangdong in the tenth year of the Republic. As we reflect on the Premier's past struggles and the difficult circumstances he faced, we gain much encouragement for our current endeavors. We firmly believe that to achieve revolutionary success, we must continue to fight against the remaining warlords. Our Premier, amidst hardships, fought against enemies and the heavy oppression of imperialism and the warlords Cao Kun and Wu Peifu. At that time, Cao Kun, Wu Peifu, Xu Shichang, and their ilk, used threats and inducements against the Kuomintang, causing rebellions within our own army. In particular, Chen Jiongming willingly betrayed us, hindering the progress of our revolution. We cannot forget the ferocious face of the traitor Chen at that time. Reflecting on the Premier's life, he was always oppressed by the environment, and soldiers and party members defected. Today, as we remember this, we cannot help but cry with sorrow. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, we can say that more than half of the Premier's lifelong advocacy and the foundation of the revolution has been achieved. However, the revolutionary environment at this time, although more advanced than before, is in fact the same as the remaining warlords of the past, or perhaps even worse. Only our territory is a little bigger than before, but society is even worse than before. Bandits and communists cause trouble everywhere. Now the remaining warlords Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan are resisting the central government. During this period, all comrades in the government should strive harder to continue the Premier's legacy and complete the revolutionary cause. We are confident that our revolution will be absolutely successful. Apart from the Kuomintang, no other party can succeed in China, and no other party can save China. Consider the military strength of Chen Jiongming in Guangdong at that time, which was greater than ours, but as soon as he rebelled, he was immediately eliminated. Now the rebellion of Yan and Feng can be said to be a good phenomenon for the future of the revolution, because if they were not exposed, it would affect the progress of the revolution. For example, if Chen Jiongming had not exposed his ambitions at that time, perhaps we would still be in Guangdong today. We know that all feudal ideas must conflict with our party, and the sooner the conflict occurs, the sooner the revolution can be completed. Revolution cannot succeed without danger and difficulty. Without danger, we cannot eliminate reactionaries. Here, we further understand that to eliminate Yan and Feng, we only need to work together to complete the revolution and fulfill the responsibilities of party members. Today, as we commemorate the day when the Premier assumed the position of Extraordinary President, I dare to encourage myself and my comrades.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Various Circles in Beijing <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The Nanjing Special City Party Department convened representatives from all circles in Beijing at 9:00 am in the main hall of the headquarters. At the same time, an expanded publicity week for the campaign against Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang was held. After the ceremonial rites, Chairman Yang Xiji delivered an opening speech, briefly stating that today we commemorate the Premier's assumption of the office of Extraordinary President. All comrades should understand the significance of the Premier's assumption of the office of Extraordinary President. The Premier assumed the office of Extraordinary President to shoulder the revolutionary responsibility for the Party, the country, and the people, and to fight against the reactionary forces of the time, so that the doctrine of saving the country and the people could be realized. Today, as we commemorate the Premier, we must continue the Premier's wishes, strive to fight, and overthrow the Yan and Feng warlords who are now undermining unity and destroying the Party and the country, and who are anti-revolutionary collaborators with imperialism, only then can we be worthy of the Premier and fulfill the responsibility of revolution. Then Liu Luyin, Li Yuanbai, Xiang Xueru and others delivered speeches. After the speeches, slogans were shouted, photographs were taken, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Held in the Capital <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>May Fourth Movement Commemoration Meeting</p>
<p>The Nanjing Special City Party Department held a commemoration meeting in the main hall at 10:00 am on the 11th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. About 200 representatives from various government ministries, departments, and mass organizations attended. Chairman Yang Xiji of the City Executive Committee reported after the ceremonial rites that during the 7th and 8th years of the Republic, Chinese politics were corrupt, foreign powers were forcing concessions, and the people's livelihood was declining to the extreme. At that time, it was the end of the European War, and the Paris Peace Conference opened. The European and American powers were preparing to shift their strength to continue to invade our country. Japanese imperialism seized the opportunity to take the lead, colluding with Cao Rulin, Zhang Zongchang, Lu Zongyu and others to rob our country of its sovereignty. Duan Qirui then followed Yuan Shikai in making a second tacit acknowledgement of the conditions for national subjugation, and continued to carry out huge loans, hoping to obtain the assistance of Japanese imperialism to consolidate his position. At that time, the lifeline of the country was hanging by a thread. The general students full of blood and courage, especially the students in Beiping who were directly under the control of the warlord government and the imperialist embassy, ​​were filled with grief and indignation in the autumn of life and death, and could not bear it any longer. They resolutely raised their arms and stood up to be the vanguard of the people. On May 4, 1919, they held a grand protest demonstration, violently beat the traitors, besieged the residences of the traitors, and attacked the warlord government and resisted imperialism. It shocked the whole country for a while. Students and businessmen in various places responded one after another, and evolved into a universal and great patriotic movement. The national spirit was promoted, the traitors converged, and the initiative of the modern national self-awareness and self-salvation movement in our country was launched. In terms of cultural movement, it was the first manifestation of ideological revolution; in terms of social movement, it was the beginning of people's participation in politics; in terms of diplomacy, it was the first step towards people's diplomacy; in terms of national liberation, it was the first page of the brilliant light of national revolution. For the youth students themselves, it was a new era of patriotic movement, and it was worth permanent commemoration. The great significance of holding this commemoration this year is: (1) From now on, thoughts and actions must be based on the Three Principles of the People; (2) To cultivate a sound revolutionary psychology; (3) To cultivate constructive knowledge and ability; (4) To devote ourselves to the revolution under the leadership of our Party; (5) To assist the central government in eradicating the remnants of warlords, and more importantly, the imperialist aggression of China. In addition to political and economic ways, cultural aggression is the most serious. Taking unequal treaties as amulets, Christian youth associations and other church schools are set up everywhere, filling the minds of young people with imperialist seeds and deeply dyeing feudal ideas. Good young people are anesthetized for a long time and easily become slaves of imperialism. Therefore, it is necessary to reclaim the right to education and resist imperialist cultural aggression in order to complete the unfinished achievements of the May Fourth Movement. Then Lai Lian, member of the City Executive Committee, delivered a poignant speech, and then shouted slogans and dispersed.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Jinan on the May Third Memorial Day <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The whole city flies flags at half-mast to express condolences</p>
<p>All circles held a memorial meeting</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence, the Jinan May Third Massacre is an unprecedented shame for the Chinese nation, and also the most tragic tragedy in the world. Therefore, the whole country is indignant and the gods are saddened. Time flies, and two years have passed. Although Jinan has been taken over, the terms of investigation and compensation have not yet been fulfilled by the Japanese side, causing thousands of compatriots who were killed to sink to the bottom of the sea, unable to rest in peace. On the occasion of the second anniversary of this tragic case, all parts of the country unanimously hold solemn and fierce commemorations to express their unforgettable memory, and the 400,000 people in Jinan have suffered the remaining fire of the Japanese massacre, and their personal pain is even more indignant. In the past few days, they have actively prepared for the memorial meeting. Today (3rd), all circles in the city will fly flags at half-mast and stop entertainment to express their condolences. All schools and factories will be closed for one day. All newspapers will publish supplements with various photos of the Japanese soldiers' massacre of Chinese people on May 3, 1928, to arouse public attention. Various groups and organizations also printed leaflets separately and distributed them along the streets. The people were extremely excited. The military authorities were deeply afraid that some villains would take the opportunity to disturb public order, so the garrison command and the public security bureau dispatched a large number of soldiers and police to strengthen their posts and guard the streets to avoid accidents. The Japanese Consul in Jinan, Nishida, knew that he was unreasonable. In addition to requesting the military and police to protect the Japanese expatriates, he also notified the Japanese in Jinan that they were not allowed to go out to avoid misunderstandings. Some Japanese even went to Qingdao to avoid it. The memorial meeting held by all circles was held in the Nan Guan Yan Wu Hall. From 8:00 am, staff from various agencies, people from all walks of life, and students from various schools went to the meeting in a column. More than 500 groups and about 100,000 people came to the meeting. Each held a small flag with various slogans and slogans written on it, and many people distributed leaflets on the spot. The atmosphere was extremely tense. A high platform was built on the north side of the Yan Wu Hall, with Party and national flags intertwined, a portrait of the Premier hanging, and the spirit tablets of the May Third martyrs erected as a place for the meeting and paying respects. A high pavilion was built on the south side as a place for the chief commander to issue orders. The staff of the conference were all assigned in advance. The chairman was He Siyuan, the propaganda minister of the Provincial Rectification Committee, the chief commander was Zhang Yixian, the director of the public sports field, the master of ceremonies was Yu Hongchan of the Municipal Rectification Committee, and the record was Wang Yumin of the Provincial Rectification Committee. The meeting started at 9:00 am. First, everyone stood in silence, played mourning music, and sang the Party song. Then, they bowed three times to the Party and national flags, the Premier's portrait, and the martyred compatriots. Then, Chairman He Siyuan respectfully read the Premier's will, and Ms. Gong Jixiang and Chen Zuzhen offered wreaths. Zheng Henian of the Municipal Rectification Committee read the memorial text, which said, "On May 3, 19th year of the Republic of China, the citizens of Jinan respectfully pay their respects to the spirits of the martyrs who were killed in the Jinan May Third Massacre and tell them in writing, alas, martyrs, born to be heroes, died to be spirits, suffered the red sheep catastrophe, sacrificed their lives to become benevolent, tracing the source of the disaster, starting from the violent Japan, doing whatever it wants, and getting an inch. The national revolution is for self-preservation, exterminating the power, and saving our people. Touching its jealousy, sending troops to Jiaoji, provoking incidents for no reason, and the disaster began. Killing our officials, slaughtering our people, blood flowing into rivers, corpses piling up like hills, burning our city, destroying our city walls, not enough, and even more looting for a year, always being ferocious, the living suffer pain, the dead are not at peace, after such a strange revenge, two years have passed, and it has not been avenged, and blood and tears are shed in vain, the martyrs have spirits, protect and inspire the dead, and do everything to eliminate Wu, to avenge this shame, alas, I respectfully inform you," after reading, Chairman He Siyuan reported the purpose of the meeting, briefly saying that on this day two years ago, Japanese soldiers opened fire on our Chinese compatriots in Jinan, massacring them. At 10:00 am, in the business district, Japanese soldiers fired at Chinese soldiers. Before the Chinese soldiers returned fire, they abducted more than 1,000 Chinese soldiers and brutally killed our country's diplomatic envoy, Cai Gongshi. On the 4th, they issued the Demands to our country, making various unreasonable demands, limiting the Chinese army to withdraw 20 li outside within seven hours, and implementing great insulting measures against the Chinese nation. China received demands from various countries, but none were as severe as those of the Japanese. Because China did not agree to its demands, Japan began to bomb the city with artillery on the 8th, killing more than 3,000 Chinese people and causing property losses of more than 50 million. I would like to ask, no matter which country, which people can do this kind of thing, only Japan dares to open fire in China and arbitrarily kill people. This is really a great shame for China. I hope that the Chinese people, especially the youth of Shandong, will never forget it until death, and must work hard to avenge this shame. Do you all know if Jinan has been resolved now? It hasn't been resolved at all. It has been more than a year since Jinan was taken over. The terms of sending people to investigate the Jinan case and compensate for losses have not yet been fulfilled by Japan. The Chinese investigators have already been sent, but Japan has been delaying and not sending them. Therefore, today's meeting has a proposal, which is to ask the central government to urge Japan to send investigators for the Jinan case as soon as possible in order to resolve the case as soon as possible. China has always compensated or ceded land for killing a foreigner. Last year, Japan killed a Chinese rickshaw puller in Qingdao, and only agreed to compensate 200 yuan. It really doesn't treat the Chinese people as human beings. You all have to think about whether we Shandong people are human beings or not. It can kill thousands of people and be done with it? We Chinese people are not for sale, we are demanding justice, fairness and humanity. The status of the Chinese nation, the imperialists of all countries, do not treat the Chinese people as human beings, we should concentrate our strength and overthrow all imperialism. After today's meeting, we must not forget the May Third Massacre at all times, do not forget the evil of Japan and all imperialists, unite and do everything to deal with him, etc. Then Zhang Jinjian, representative of the Provincial Rectification Committee, Zhang Hongjian of the Municipal Rectification Committee, Guo Yumin, representative of the United Association of Victims of the Jinan Case, Sun Ziyi, a student from the attached elementary school of the First Women's Normal School, Feng Xianzhou, a student from the senior high school, Hua Degang, a student from Yuying Middle School, Wang Ruyu, a student from Jimei Middle School, Qiu Zuming, a student from the Municipal Fifth Elementary School, Jiang Shifen, a student from the Fifth Experimental Elementary School, Rao Shuzhen, a student from the Municipal Third Elementary School, and Ms. Rao Shuzhen, gave speeches one after another, all of which were extremely passionate and慷慨. Finally, Song Zhixian of the Provincial Rectification Committee reported the proposals of the conference: (1) To telegraph the central government to transfer the national government to strictly implement revolutionary diplomacy; (2) To telegraph the central government to transfer the national government to order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to urge the Japanese side to send investigators for the Jinan case as soon as possible in order to resolve the case as soon as possible; (3) To send a telegram to the whole country to jointly condemn Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang, who colluded with Japanese imperialism, to the public for deliberation, and all were approved. Then they shouted slogans and played music to dismiss the meeting. (May 3)</p>

<h3 id="e55">Important Military News between Xu and Yu <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Enemy Forces in Yucheng and Xiayi Retreat Backwards</p>
<p>Rumors of Mutiny in Sun Dianying's Forces</p>
<p>A fast dispatch from Xuzhou states that according to military sources, the enemy's frontline troops in Yucheng and Xiayi suddenly began retreating backward on the first day of the month. Their plan to advance eastward on the third seems to have been altered again. However, their frontline mixed troops appear to be quite disorganized. Wan Xuancai, Sun Dianying, and others have been constantly sending representatives to Xuzhou to negotiate surrender, but it seems that this side does not attach much importance to it. Since General Commander Chiang issued a vow to suppress Yan and Feng on the first, the morale of the Central Army has been greatly boosted. The Central Army's front line in eastern Henan has been fully deployed, gaining the upper hand. They remain calm and composed, awaiting further orders. According to a reliable investigation of the enemy's front line, Wan Xuancai himself has arrived in Guide, Sun Chu's troops have also arrived in the Kaifeng and Lanfeng area, and Shi Yousan's troops are still in Kaocheng and Dongming. Sun Dianying's troops seem to be increasing towards Haozhou. It is said that Feng has appointed Sun Chu as the commander-in-chief, but the front mixed troops cannot be unified. The aviation team has been dispatching planes to patrol for days to destroy enemy defenses. It is reported that on the second, a large number of planes flew west and dropped eight bombs on Guide and Lanfeng, destroying one train of enemy vehicles at Guide Station and one transport vehicle at Lanfeng Station. The enemy is very panicked because the enemy's forward troops have no aircraft and have no way to resist the Central Army's aircraft. Central Army armored vehicles are continuously patrolling and defending the western route, and the road defense is extremely solid. The Xuyang passenger car runs smoothly as usual. According to another telegram from Fan Xixu, our aviation team has dispatched planes to fly west for days, bombing and injuring many of Shi's troops in Dongming and Kaocheng. Ye Kaixin also telegraphed that there was a mutiny in Sun Dianying's army in Haozhou, and many returned to their villages. The enemy's morale has collapsed. According to military observations, our army is absolutely confident in attacking. Many of the enemy's forward generals have expressed their willingness to surrender, which is particularly unfavorable to the enemy. Even if the Jin army joins the front, the combat effectiveness is quite lacking. The military situation in Xu and Yu should not be prolonged. (3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e56">Aftermath of the Xiamen Convenience Steamer Tragedy <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Corpses and Relatives' Groups Established</p>
<p>Statements from the Party Department and Customs</p>
<p>A dispatch from Xiamen on the 28th states that the convenience steamship of the Quanxia Liaison Line Quanhe Automobile Company sank between Wutong and Aotou, killing passengers. It has been ascertained that 192 people drowned. Up to the most recent count, 158 bodies have been recovered. The joint meeting of the Party, government, and military decided to arrest the responsible person, but it has not yet been implemented. The resolution to have the relatives of the deceased file a lawsuit in court, requesting the sealing of the assets of the person in charge, is still under investigation. A group of relatives has been established and a committee for receiving the assets of Quanhe has been organized, but they are all in preparation. As for the Party, government, and military, they have handed this case over to the court for handling. The headquarters has not intervened. On the Party's side, the "Committee for Handling the Wutong Shipwreck Tragedy by the Party Departments of Various Counties in Southern Fujian," organized by the Party Departments of Siming, Jinjiang, Nan'an, and Hui'an counties, has issued a declaration stating that Quanhe Automobile Company is certainly fully responsible for this tragedy. Therefore, at 9:00 AM on the 11th, Comrades Chen Lianfen and Zhang Fubin of the Siming County Steering Committee went to the Xiamen Garrison Headquarters to see Commander Lin Guogeng and asked him to detain the persons involved in this case first and await handling. At that time, Commander Lin said that in order to be cautious, he would first send someone to investigate the truth and then handle it according to the circumstances. The judicial authorities have also not taken concrete action, so that the person in charge of the company is still at large, even publishing notices, saying nice things and confusing social rumors. The officials of the authorities are tolerant and considerate, which can be said to be meticulous, but we believe that this tragedy is not comparable to ordinary events. The Xiamen military, government, and judicial authorities, who live and eat here, should, in theory, make an emergency decision and quickly detain the persons involved in the tragedy and await trial. But now it is the opposite. No wonder there is a full stomach of doubts and complaints.</p>
<p>After this case occurred, the Party Department and various social groups sent letters to the Customs asking questions. Quanhe Company also claimed that the excess number of passengers was released after being checked by Liu Wudian Changguan. The Customs Superintendent issued a letter to the Chinese Council on the 25th, explaining Quanhe's violations and responsibilities. The original text is as follows: Directly replying, on the 16th of this month, the letter from Taiwan regarding the case of the convenience steamship of Quanhe Automobile Company causing disaster in Wutong Port was received, and the suggestions made were approved by this office to the Customs Commissioner, who replied that all ships registered in this Customs are inspected once a year. If the hull and machinery are not strong, they will be ordered to stop sailing. The convenience electric boat was inspected by this Customs on February 7 this year, and the hull and machinery were found to be suitable for use. Its tonnage is eight tons and zero forty-eight, and the Customs has limited the number of passengers to eighty-five, including sixty-four in the upper cabin and twenty-one in the lower cabin. It was found that this ship was sailing from Aotou to Wutong, and it actually carried more passengers privately beyond the number limited by the Customs in order to profit, so it sank between Ao and Wu, and did not sail to Liu Wudian, so Liu Wudian Changguan had no way to check. Before the accident, this Customs and its affiliated branches had repeatedly warned the ships not to carry more passengers than the limited number. Unexpectedly, the ship only cared about profit and disregarded danger, which led to the occurrence of this tragedy. Tracing back to the cause, it was all because of the ship's captain, and it was found that all foreign transport ships must first have lifebuoys prepared by the ship, and then limit the number of passenger berths according to the number, so there is one ring for each passenger, and even if there is danger, they can be rescued according to the number of people, but Chinese ships rarely have this equipment, so once there is danger, there is no way to deal with it. Now the ship has caused many deaths due to non-compliance with customs regulations, which is very regrettable. The shipowner should be held responsible. In addition to returning the original document, the letter is hereby replied for your information. The Xiamen Customs Supervision Office.</p>

<p>The County Government is Preparing to Welcome and Bring Back Lake Bandits On the 28th of last month, the town of Sijing was plundered by lake bandits, who fled in all directions. Thirty people were intercepted by Qingpu County in various places and handed over to the Qingpu County Government for questioning. After investigation, two merchants were found to be innocent. Among the remaining bandits were those who had participated in the Chonggu robbery case. County Magistrate Shen handled them separately. Yesterday, a note came from Songjiang, saying that 13 bandits related to the Sijing robbery case and one dead bandit had been captured. After investigation, it was confirmed that they were requesting the dispatch of police to bring them back for legal action. The local county government is preparing the procedures for welcoming and bringing back the bandits.</p>
<p>Cheap Tin Foil Sparks Controversy The Yuanheng Store, opened by the Shao gang in Bailongtangkou, specializes in tin foil and held a low-price sale starting on the 2nd of this month, and moved to the old site of Luyongshun. The Zhentai, Dingtai, and Jinwen paper stores of this gang also launched a low-price sale. At the same time, other paper stores that also operate tin foil have also risen up in response and distributed flyers to attract customers. The wording in the flyers caused a misunderstanding by the Yuanheng Foil Store, which also printed flyers and hired a military band to parade and distribute them, but there were many retorts in the wording. The local colleagues were angry after seeing it and have now asked the industry representatives to question the store. It is said that both sides have reported their reasons, and it may not be easy to resolve them at once.</p>

<p>Received Threatening Letter After Robbery The home of Zhu Pansheng in Zhuxiang Lane, Kaiyuan Township, Fourth District, was robbed of clothing and accessories worth more than 1,000 yuan on the night of the 30th of last month. Afterwards, a list of losses was filed and submitted to the county government for investigation. Unexpectedly, the Zhu family suddenly received a letter from the bandits a few days ago, stating, "This time, Mr. Zhu got a big advantage, but he reported it to the government and published it in the newspaper. We cannot forgive it. Now we still need to borrow thousands of yuan, otherwise we will deal with it with drastic measures." The Zhu family was panicked and didn't know what to do. The Detective Chief of the Water Police District and the Police Chief of the County Government went to the countryside yesterday to investigate and verify the traces for investigation.</p>
<p>Communist Arrested and Handed Over to the County Yu Jugen (also known as Aju), a famous communist in Yuxiang, Wuliuqiutu, under the county's jurisdiction, had gathered his accomplices last year to shoot and kill villager Xu Ayuan. The county government had issued an arrest warrant for him. Recently, Yu suddenly returned home, intending to sell his ancestral property to others. His wife, Yu Tao, expressed her opposition and earnestly advised her husband to oppose the Communist Party. Unexpectedly, Yu Jugen roared loudly, making a lot of noise. Yu Tao was extremely angry and went to the First Squadron of the police stationed in the township to report that her husband, Yu Jugen, was a communist and requested his arrest. After receiving the report, Squadron Leader Feng immediately led armed police officers to arrest Yu and took him back for questioning. He was handed over to the county police team for interrogation. Yu Jugen confessed that he was thirty-three years old and did not admit to joining the Communist Party.

<p>Continued Request for Verification and Issuance of Road Work Wages: The explicit decree stipulates that road work wages for road construction workers can only be issued in areas where more than 50% of the region has been affected by disasters. This year's autumn survey at the county level and above, though approved for a tax reduction of 2.4%, in reality the disaster damage exceeded 50%. Therefore, according to Article 6, Item 3 of the Finance Department's ordinance on disaster assessment and tax reduction, which states that for areas with more than 50% damage, 30% of taxes should be levied, a continued request has been submitted to the Construction Department, along with the relevant ordinance, requesting verification and issuance of road work wages.

<p>Major Dispute over Fish Farming in Chengxi: A certain Jia, a resident of Shaoxing residing in Jiaxing's Youchegang, joined with local townspeople to initiate fish farming with staked enclosures in the Chengze and Liansi lakes near Chengxi in order to profit from fishing. However, this was opposed by local townspeople, who submitted a complaint to the provincial government. After review, the provincial government, in accordance with Article 5 of the Zhejiang Western Water Conservancy Prohibition Rules, ordered the county to stop the practice. Disregarding the provincial order, the fish farmers continued their activities, placing stakes in Liansi Lake recently in preparation for stocking. The people of Yang'an village nearby felt that this method would cut off the livelihood of the fishing households and therefore拔所所插之　, removed the stakes. This provoked the anger of the Shaoxing residents, who gathered a large group yesterday to beat the residents of Yang'an Village at their doorstep. The villagers also gathered a large group and seized three Shaoxing boats and detained three Shaoxing residents. Both parties have now filed lawsuits in court.</p>

<p>Having read your newspaper's report stating that the Ningbo Municipal Public Security Bureau and its branch offices have not paid police salaries for two months, leading to threats of a strike, we find this to be untrue. The city's police expenses are more than 20,300 yuan per month. Since Mayor Yang took office on March 1st, more than 30,500 yuan has already been issued, with the remainder being allocated successively. It is likely that your newspaper has received inaccurate information. We hope that you will correct this matter. Ningbo Municipal Government (May 3, 19th year)</p>

<p>Esteemed Editor, The item in your newspaper's Jiashan correspondence on May 1st, entitled "Evidence Found of Collusion with Bandits," is completely inconsistent with the facts. I was unfortunately kidnapped by bandits, and was rescued through the efforts of relatives and friends, without any connection to Chen Shaoqing.</p>
<p>The report in your newspaper not only damages my reputation, but also the crime of colluding with bandits and paying ransom is no small matter. Having personally experienced this ordeal, I cannot remain silent. Therefore, I am writing to you to request,</p>

<p>Pay Attention to the Recovery of Educational Rights in Concessions</p>
<p>And Submits a Report to the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Education for Review</p>
<p>Chen Dezheng, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Education, has always paid close attention to the recovery of educational rights in the concessions. Recently, starting on May 4th, he launched a movement to recover educational rights in the concessions, issuing a circular to all educational organizations to comply, and issuing a declaration. The details have been published in this newspaper. According to the Bureau of Education, a report has been submitted to the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Education for review, and a letter has been sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting attention. The original reports and letters are recorded below.</p>
<p>Letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: It is respectfully reported that the educational rights in the Shanghai concessions are not under the jurisdiction of the proper educational authorities in the city, causing the citizens of the concessions to be in an environment without education. In the autumn of the 16th year of the Republic, the educational situation in the public concessions was investigated and a declaration on the educational rights in the concessions was issued, inviting educational scholars to discuss solutions, and contacting the concession authorities. This semester's investigation should ban various private schools, most of which are located in the concessions. Moreover, investigations and bans inevitably lead to conflicts. Therefore, it is necessary to recover the educational rights in the concessions immediately. A report was previously submitted to the Central Party Headquarters for review, and it is said that it has been forwarded to your ministry for handling. It is unknown how it is progressing. We respectfully request detailed instructions to facilitate contact. Furthermore, in commemoration of May Fourth, this Bureau feels the need to resist the cultural aggression of imperialists, and the recovery of educational rights in this city's concessions is a prerequisite for resisting cultural aggression. Therefore, a declaration has been issued to promote attention from all sectors. A copy is enclosed for your ministry's swift assistance in handling this matter. This is the envoy's request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Enclosed: one copy of the declaration. Director Chen Dezheng of the Bureau of Education.</p>
<p>Report to the Municipal Government: Report regarding the issuance of a declaration to recover educational rights in the concessions, requesting review. This Bureau has investigated that education in the concessions of this city is not under the jurisdiction of the proper educational authorities in the city, but is managed by foreigners, making rectification difficult and promotion not easy, causing the citizens of the concessions to be in an environment without education. In the autumn of the 16th year of the Republic, this Bureau investigated the educational situation in the public concessions and issued a declaration to recover educational rights in the concessions, inviting educational scholars to discuss solutions, and contacting the concession authorities. This year, another report was submitted to the Central Party Headquarters for review, and it is said that it has been forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for handling. For three years, it has been in progress. This semester's investigation should ban various private schools, so that the educational rights in the concessions must be recovered as soon as possible. On this occasion of the May Fourth commemoration, this Bureau, in order to awaken citizens to the cultural aggression of imperialists, has issued a declaration to promote attention from all sectors to stop cultural aggression. Therefore, we submit this report along with the declaration, requesting your review. Respectfully submitted to Mayor Zhang. Enclosed: one copy of the declaration. Director Chen Dezheng of the Shanghai Special City Bureau of Education. A similar report to the Ministry of Education is not recorded.</p>
<h3 id="e69">A Review of the Second National Education Conference (9) <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>(7) Plan to Improve Higher Education</p>
<p>Higher education is planned to focus on enriching the content and raising the standards of existing universities during the six-year period of political tutelage. Only qualitative improvements will be made, and no quantitative expansion will be made. Efforts will be made to increase the number of students studying abroad and to establish specialized schools. Extra efforts will be made to allocate funds over ten years to encourage academic research.</p>
<p>(1) Measures to Enrich National Universities</p>
<p>(1) Supplementing construction: University classrooms, dormitories, and offices are mostly incomplete, and other general and special construction projects are even more lacking. Remedial measures include: A. The Ministry of Education will instruct national universities to consider the urgency of the situation and report the construction projects that need to be carried out, along with drawings and budgets. After investigation and approval, the Ministry of Finance will be notified to allocate temporary funds to each university for construction according to schedule. B. The Ministry of Education will instruct national universities to economize on regular expenses and transfer funds for construction, but this should not exceed 10% of the budget. C. National universities can raise private donations to carry out important construction projects. Donations of 1,000 yuan or more should be reported to the Ministry of Education for commendation.</p>
<p>(2) Expanding university equipment in preparation should be carried out simultaneously with construction. Currently, most national universities are poorly equipped. Remedial measures include: A. The Ministry of Education will formulate standards for the equipment of each college in the university and order each university to gradually expand according to the standards. B. It is stipulated that equipment fees should account for 30% to 40% of the university's budget, of which library fees should not be less than 20% for colleges of arts, law, commerce, and education, and not less than 10% for colleges of science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine. Instrument and specimen fees should not be less than 20% for colleges of science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine. C. Investigate the equipment expenses required by national universities that exceed 40% of the regular expenses, and transfer the funds to the Ministry of Finance to allocate temporary funds. D. Investigate which national universities need special scientific equipment, and request the China Cultural Education Foundation or other Gengkuan funds to provide subsidies.</p>
<p>(3) Reorganizing departments and courses: The University Organization Law stipulates that universities must establish at least one college, and each college should have departments. Except for the College of Medicine, which does not have departments, and the College of Law, which may have only a law department, the Colleges of Arts, Science, Education, Agriculture, and Commerce should each establish departments as the minimum requirement. Currently, national universities are self-governing and cannot be consistent. Reorganization measures include: A. National universities with less than three colleges should urgently increase the number of colleges within a limited time to meet urgent needs. National universities with three or more colleges need not increase the number of colleges temporarily within two years. They should increase the number of departments to enrich the content of each college. B. National universities that increase the number of colleges and departments should first start with equipment, prepare a budget, and submit it to the Ministry of Education for review and approval by the Ministry of Finance. National universities in the same region should avoid duplication when adding colleges and departments. Those that have already been duplicated should be merged within the possible range. C. The Ministry of Education should organize a committee to formulate curriculum standards for each college and department of national universities. Before the standards are formulated, each university should formulate its own curriculum and submit it to the Ministry for approval. This curriculum should focus on the main courses. Those that are required courses in Department A may be elective courses in Department B. There should be no disagreement, and courses with different names but the same content should not be established indiscriminately. In order to adapt to local conditions, special lectures on scientific aspects may be set up in addition to the prescribed courses. The expenses may be borne by the Ministry of Education, which will transfer them to the China Education and Culture Foundation or other Gengkuan funds. D. Students' course selection should be guided by the department head or professor, distinguishing between major and minor courses that are interrelated. They should not avoid difficult courses. The number of credits for each course should be stipulated in the curriculum standards.</p>
<p>(4) Improving teaching effectiveness: Currently, many university faculty and staff hold concurrent positions, and the average number of students taught per person is less than four. In terms of effectiveness, it is not economical. Measures to improve effectiveness include: A. Before the Ministry of Education implements the review of university faculty qualifications, national universities should carefully select and hire professors and lecturers in accordance with the regulations on university faculty qualifications. If there are no suitable talents in the country to take on the most important subjects, famous foreign scholars should be hired at high salaries, or they should be jointly hired by various schools to give lectures in rotation. B. National universities should appropriately increase the salaries of faculty members in accordance with the university faculty salary scale. Those who can devote themselves to research and writing may appropriately reduce the number of teaching hours. If funds are not very generous, unimportant subjects should be appropriately cut to concentrate the subjects. C. National universities should do their best to reduce staff and increase faculty members. Faculty members should be full-time in principle, and part-time faculty members should not exceed one-third of the total number. Faculty members from School A who also hold faculty or important positions at School B must be strictly prohibited. D. University professors and lecturers should have designated times to meet with students on campus outside of classroom teaching and be responsible for individual guidance. Those with teacher and student dormitories should promote and try out the tutor system. E. National university students should be valued for their quality rather than quantity, and attention should be paid to strict examinations and extracurricular assignments to enrich their knowledge and skills. F. National universities should successively establish research institutes or research centers.</p>
<p>(5) Determining and allocating funds: A. Salaries should account for 55% to 65%, of which faculty salaries should not be less than 45% and staff salaries should not exceed 10%. B. Equipment fees should account for 30% to 40%. C. Office expenses should account for 5% to 10%. D. Special expenses should not exceed 5%.</p>
<p>(2) Reorganize existing provincial universities and stipulate methods for increasing the location of universities</p>
<p>(1) Existing provincial universities should be reorganized in accordance with the University Organization Law and Regulations. Those that meet the regulations should be expanded according to the special needs of the local area. A. Shanxi University currently has departments of arts, law, and engineering, and should add a college of medicine. B. Chengdu University, Chengdu Normal University, and Sichuan University should be merged into one university, and colleges of arts, science, law, and education should be established based on the existing departments. A college of medicine will be added in the future. C. Hebei University currently has colleges of arts, law, agriculture, and medicine, and the Hebei College of Law and Commerce should be merged into it. D. Henan Zhongshan University should be renamed Henan University. Shaanxi Zhongshan University and Lanzhou Zhongshan University should first be reorganized into small-scale independent colleges, each with departments of arts and sciences, tentatively named Shaanxi College and Gansu College. If Guangxi, Guizhou, and Jilin Universities cannot comply with the regulations quickly, they should also be reorganized into independent colleges, each with departments of arts and sciences. E. Anhui University and Hunan University should be given a time limit to seek the need to fill the departments.</p>
<p>(2) In addition to the established national and provincial universities or colleges, the location of future universities should be determined by the Ministry of Education in accordance with the financial resources, environment, and requirements of each locality.</p>
<p>(3) All newly established universities should be called colleges when they are first established, with departments of arts and sciences. Only after three colleges are completed can they be called universities. In addition to colleges belonging to arts and sciences, they must be set up according to local needs. Before the colleges are set up, senior high schools should be set up.</p>
<p>(4) Provinces with or near national universities do not need to set up provincial universities.</p>

<p>The Japan Sports Association, regarding the Far Eastern Games anthem and the spirit of the games, solicited submissions from across the nation. The winning entry has now been announced, with the winner being Mr. Adachi, an official at the Osaka City Hall. This anthem will be sung at the opening ceremony and during the march-in. A Chinese translation is as follows: Glory begins in the East, competition is strength, Asian children, excellent talents gather today, before our homeland, stand, raging waves roar, test strength and weakness, glory begins in the East, competition is strength, the world's fierce competitors, excellent talents gather today, homeland flag, rise, verdant peaks gleam, compare prowess.</p>

<p>7 PM at the Chinese Basketball Arena</p>
<p>A fierce competition is guaranteed</p>
<p>The Chinese team's recent two performances have been greatly admired by the audience. Tonight at 7 PM, the team will compete against Van Ward at the Chinese Basketball Arena. The so-called Van Ward team consists of athletes from the John team, along with the Western star Sullivan. Players such as Qu Hongren, Chen Xianglong, Hou Xuemin, Diao Youdao, Lin Zequn, Zheng Xingming, Ying Qiaoshu, Huang Gongxiu, and Cao Fukang will all be participating. Their strength is much greater than that of the former MacLains and Four Sabers teams. Although the Chinese team can be confident of victory, it certainly won't be as easy as in the past.</p>

<p>Arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the Canada</p>
<p>The competition schedule has been greatly altered</p>
<p>The Honolulu Overseas Chinese baseball team, representing China, arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the Canada. Sixteen members arrived, and they were welcomed at the port by Hao Boyang of the Association and Liu Dacheng, a veteran of Shanghai baseball. They are currently residing at the Chinese Jingnian Association. The team members are all top picks and possess strong skills, unmatched in Honolulu. Five of them also participated in the previous Far Eastern Games and achieved remarkable results. Regarding the games in Shanghai, there have been significant changes. It has been decided that there will be three games, two against the United States and one against Japan. This is because China's fighting strength is very strong and requires formidable opponents to provide adequate challenge. The major competition schedule is listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Far Eastern Tennis Championship <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Japanese confident of victory</p>
<p>Our country's athletes must strive harder</p>
<p>Mr. Yashikawa, a prominent figure in Japanese tennis, wrote an article titled "Japan Can Win at the Games' Tennis" in the Sports World magazine published by the Sports Association. He discussed the strengths of the three countries in detail. Although his confidence may be excessive, it is still valuable for our reference. The translation is as follows:</p>
<p>Anyone who makes predictions about the Far Eastern Games' tennis championship</p>
<p>must not ignore the results of the Malani Carnival tennis competition this spring, as it was a competition to determine the Philippine representatives and can be considered a prelude to the Far Eastern Games. Not only Filipino players participated, but also players from Japan and especially from China, where Lin and Qiu were destined to meet in the Tokyo Games, and also Japan's Sato and Bui.</p>
<p>A decisive encounter</p>
<p>In the singles competition at that event, Japan's Sato and Bui easily won. At the Tokyo Games this month, those two will naturally be able to secure victory, and thanks to their singles wins, Japan can hope to achieve nine points of victory.</p>
<p>The doubles competition, however, is a different matter. Japanese players cannot be careless about this. The collaboration of the Filipino Alejo brothers is the best in the Philippines, and they defeated the Sato-Bui team at the carnival. Their strength should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>The Far Eastern doubles competition has always been a hard-fought battle. The Sato-Bui team attending from Japan cannot be considered the best. In terms of teamwork, the pairing of Shima and Yamagishi is superior. Japan will likely send the latter to seek revenge and wipe away the shame in this tournament. When the four powerhouses meet, there will certainly be a fierce battle. One could say that the excitement of the Games' tennis competition lies entirely in this battle.</p>
<p>What is the strength of the Philippines? In singles, the best is Alejo's younger brother, and Incha is second. According to recent news, they may not attend due to favorable conditions for attending. The third is Anbu, followed by Alejo's brother and Sanggesheng, who are evenly matched. Alejo's brother is very strong, but his technique is not consistent. As for doubles, the Alejo brothers are definitely Japan's strong rivals. If the Philippine Association cannot offer the brothers good terms despite a certain amount of expedition expenses, their substitutes would be the Anbu-Sanggesheng team, which is much weaker.</p>
<p>From the colony, China can send very outstanding players. Although this year's players don't seem very spirited, Mr. Lin has won championships in Australia, and Mr. Qiu has won championships in Singapore. The newcomers Jiang (Daozhang) and Wu (Shizhang) are also quite strong. Japan should remember its victory at the eighth Games, so it should also pay attention to Lin and Qiu. Otherwise, an unexpected loss is unavoidable, though it should not affect the championship.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Japan has never had players as strong as this year's. In terms of strength, it definitely has an absolute advantage among the three countries. Furthermore, since the Games are being held in Japan, Japanese players have an advantage. Teams traveling to a country with drastic changes in environment, if they compete without sufficient rest, will feel disadvantaged, whether it is the Philippines or China. In terms of climate, the impact on Chinese players is not as great as on the Philippine team. In Japan's colder climate, Filipino players may not be able to perform to their full potential. Therefore, as long as there are no major problems on Sato's side, the Japanese team can first defeat the Philippine army three to one, and then defeat China three to one or four to zero.</p>
<p>Japan is certainly very strong in the women's competition, but it is not guaranteed that they can win as easily as the men. Moreover, there are quite a few capable players among the Philippine players. Most likely, the governor's daughter, Miss Christie, will come. Although she lost in the Malani finals, she is a fairly good player.</p>
<p>The Chinese female players have not yet been determined. The two ladies, Li and Liang, who won in Hangzhou last month, both have considerable strength. Therefore, we must not repeat the mistake of the last time in Shanghai, where we only gathered some beautiful women and did not use skill as the standard.</p>
<p>On the Japanese side, in the singles competition, there are Nagohoshi Kobayashi Tomoko, Takiguchi Reiko of the Hahuku Club, and Iimura Toshiko. In the doubles competition, there is the Kobayashi-Asabuki team. All of them are experienced and strong players.</p>
<p>In summary, this championship belongs to Japan. China is not a concern for Japan. Japan's only opponent is the Philippines, and the only question is the margin of victory.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Strength of Japanese Women's Athletics <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Indeed a formidable opponent for our country's representatives</p>
<p>Hoping that our country's athletes will pay special attention</p>
<p>Ms. Sun, Ms. Wu, and Ms. Feng, work hard</p>
<p>On April 27th and 28th, the Asahi Shimbun Company held the All-Japan Women's Athletic Games in Tokyo. Although this event is not related to the selection of athletes for the Far Eastern Games, all the results demonstrate the strength of Japanese women's athletics, which is worthy of attention by our people. According to the competition results, the best performer in the 100 meters was Ms. Muraoka, with a time of 13.5 seconds. The best in the long jump was Ms. Hitomi, with a distance of 5.68 meters, with other jumps of 4.80 meters and 4.76 meters. Ms. Hitomi is one of the world's top female athletes and holds many world records. The high jump was won by Ms. Kashima with a height of 1.38 meters, and Ms. Shimizu also reached 1.27 meters.</p>

<p>Spain defeats Belgium</p>
<p>Australia defeats Switzerland</p>
<p>Jiji News Agency, Tokyo: In the Davis Cup tennis competition, the first match between Belgium and Spain resulted in Spain winning two and losing one. In the two singles matches held on the fourth, Spain won again, thus Spain won with a score of four to one. In the match between Australia and Switzerland, Australia had already won three consecutive matches, and the outcome was already decided. In the singles match in April, Australia won again, resulting in a victory of four to zero.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Press Association Warns Du Shu <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>For insulting reporters at the National Games</p>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists Association, regarding the incident of National Games referees Du Tingshu and Shu Hong insulting reporters, sent separate letters of warning to Du Shu yesterday. The original letter is as follows: Dear Sirs, according to reports from our members Yao Gengkui and others, the National Games were held in Hangzhou this time, and reporters from various Shanghai newspapers went to the event for coverage, working hard to promote it. However, referees Du Tingtong and Shu Hong abused their authority and publicly insulted reporters from Shanghai and Hangzhou newspapers at the venue, threatening to expel them. At the time, the reporters questioned them based on reason, and Du Shu, realizing they were wrong, asked Zhou Xiangxian, the deputy director of the Games organizing committee, to apologize on their behalf. The reporters prioritized the Games and did not want to pursue the matter further, but in order to maintain the close relationship between sports and journalism, it seems that this Association should issue a serious warning to Du Shu to prevent similar unfortunate incidents from happening in the future. After investigating the above report, this Association has found it to be true. This Association believes that your actions of insulting journalists</p>
<p>hinder the cooperation between the sports and news communities, which is regrettable. We are sending this letter of advice and hope that you will pay attention and abide by the principle of mutual assistance and cooperation in the future and refrain from discourteous behavior and causing disputes. We sincerely hope for this.</p>

<p>My friend, Mr. Tang Ruogu, after marrying the famous dancer Ms. Li Ying, went to Wenzhou with Mr. Xu Xinbo, the president of the art society, and his new father-in-law, Mr. Tang Yuchi, to develop industries. It has been two months since they left. Yesterday, I received the third letter from the newly married couple and Mr. Xu, detailing their observations in Wenzhou. I have recorded some of them below.</p>
<p>Local language: The Wenzhou dialect is like Cantonese. It is easier to learn than Cantonese. However, many of its sounds are quite similar to English. It is quite ingenious and also laughable. For example, "no" is pronounced by Wenzhou people as "nuo," which is no different from the English word "NO." In addition, "completely" is read as ALL, and "see" is read as SEE. They all match the English pronunciation. It is also a good material in Chinese linguistics.</p>
<p>Single angle: Recently, single silver corners can be said to have completely disappeared in Shanghai. However, single corners are much more prevalent in Wenzhou. Double corners are rare. All shops and entertainment venues use single corners. Every dollar can be exchanged for eleven corners and fourteen or fifteen copper coins. This is different from the situation in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Bo Ou: The largest department store in Wenzhou is located in Zhongshi on Wuma Street. The store is called Bo Ou. It has built a three-story Western-style building. The area is not even as large as the Lihua Company in this city. The imported European and Western goods have the flavor of being simple and crude. Therefore, the fashionable girls of Wenzhou are still considered behind the times in the eyes of Shanghainese.</p>
<p>Songs: Since last spring, each primary school in Wenzhou has added a singing class. More of the songs taught were by Mr. Li, with "Because of You" and "Grape Fairy" being the most common. However, most cowboys hum the song "Poor Qiuxiang". There are not many views of other songs, such as "Little Painter" and "Seven Sisters Visiting the Garden."</p>
<p>Street Fu: There is a custom in Wenzhou called Intercepting Street Fu. It is said that every street has fortune. Only by intercepting it for oneself can it be effective. Therefore, every household regards this as a kind of common sense, Chen Tiqiang.</p>
<p>Watching movies is better from a distance than up close. From a distance, the light is small and clear. From up close, the light is large and blurry, and the closer you get, the stronger the light, which damages your eyes. When paying the rickshaw puller in silver coins, it is best to ask the puller to see clearly in front of you. Because cunning pullers often replace them with inferior lead coins when passengers leave in a hurry, and then chase after them to exchange them. Many people are fooled by this.</p>
<p>Villains who set up gambling stalls to lure pedestrians are often seen in remote places along the road. You can also see many winners. In fact, they are all of the same ilk. Once you're hooked, you're done for.</p>
<p>If your teeth bleed when brushing, try using cold water to avoid this. Blood flows when it encounters heat and congeals when it is cold. Therefore, cold water has a hemostatic effect in an invisible way.</p>
<p>When reading books or newspapers, do not be too close to the object. Being too close reduces the possibility of long-distance sight and will naturally make one nearsighted over time, even if they were not so before.</p>
<p>When starting a watch, there should be a fixed time. For example, if it starts at a certain time today, it should also start at the same time tomorrow. The number of revolutions should also be fixed at start. Not too much, not too little. Too much reduces the elasticity of the regulations, and too little inevitably leads to stagnation along the way.</p>
<p>Essential work is highly valued. Many upper-class figures also participate. It is beautifully called the Social Entertainment Association. This association is held every day for a month, starting from the beginning of March each year. Lanterns are hung and decorations are colorful and dazzling, and there are various entertainments to add to the fun, such as puppet shows, Wenzhou opera, Beijing opera, blind singers, and Western music bands. The period of "intercepting street Fu" during this month is the most appealing to the people of Wenzhou. These games are almost always played every night. Therefore, local residents all dress in red and green, competing to dress up, and open their doors to allow people to visit, and they make novel arrangements to compete with each other. These kinds of situations are similar to the Dajiao celebrations in July and the New Year scenes in this city. The business of hawkers is ten times more profitable.</p>
<h3 id="e94">A Record of the Tragic Seven Deaths in the Guo Residence: Ms. Han Ying <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Last month, on the 25th, a tragic massacre of seven lives occurred overnight at the Guo residence on Avenue Haig (now Huaihai Road). It was truly an unprecedented tragedy in Shanghai. I have a long-standing friendship with the Guo family, and what I have heard and seen is perhaps more accurate than what is known to the outside world. I am writing this account specifically. Readers, please do not regard it as ordinary writing. You must know that the background of this account is all marked with blood and tears.</p>
<p>Afraid to See the Little Dog: Guo's eldest daughter lived in the French Concession. A month ago, she bought a small dog, intending to give it to her mother as a pet. On the eve of the tragedy, her mother and Guo Song'an, now identified as the murderer, dined at her daughter's house. Song'an was good at judging dogs. Everyone asked him to evaluate it. He lifted the dog by the neck twice, examining all parts and checking its sex. I was also present at the time. Who knew that a great disaster would suddenly occur the next evening? Now everyone in the family is afraid to see this dog. It evokes memories of the scene and adds to the sorrow. They are even more afraid that the dog will remind them of the murderer's demeanor at the time.</p>
<p>Nurturing a Tiger to be Harmed: The Escaped Maid, Chonggui, was not originally raised by the Guo family. In 1925, Guo's daughter-in-law, Liu Yanqiu, gave birth to her eldest son, Susheng, on the occasion of his one-month celebration. Liu's mother brought the maid from Macau to Shanghai to accompany Susheng in the Guo residence. When the maid was young, her whole family suffered a bandit attack, and her parents were killed. Later, Liu's master, Quan Zhong, was ordered to suppress the bandits and rescued the maid from the tiger's den. The maid, being lonely and helpless, was fostered by Liu. The whole family treated her kindly. Unexpectedly, an unprecedented disaster arose from her. Alas, nurturing a tiger to be harmed has been true since ancient times. What can be done?</p>
<p>The Letter Arrived When the Person Died: Among the seven victims were two maids, one older and one younger. The older one, named Chunlian, died most tragically. In addition to the knife marks on her face and neck, her left hand was also severed, most likely due to resistance during the attack. Before her death, she had asked the Moonlight Company for a copy of the "Fashion Guide." Fearing that other maids would compete to read it, she used a pseudonym and had it sent to the Dunqi family. At the same time, she wrote a letter to inform the Guo family. Her intentions were truly good. How could she have known that the day the letter arrived would be the day the maid's body lay lifeless? Alas.</p>
<p>Dying with Eyes Wide Open: Guo's mother, Li Qiong'uan, and her daughter-in-law were both gentle and virtuous. Last year, the eldest daughter was engaged. Guo's mother then relinquished her duties of managing the household, entrusting all matters, large and small, to her daughter-in-law. She would then burn incense, light candles, practice vegetarianism, worship the Buddha, or teach the maids to read and write, and play with the grandchildren. Those who knew her all considered her a model matriarch. But now, she too could not die a peaceful death. If she has knowledge in the afterlife, I know that she would die with her eyes wide open.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Anecdotes about Banknotes: Qiu·Lang· <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Banknotes are credit securities for the circulation of currency in society. Examining their system, they originated from the Jiaozi and Huizi of the Southern Song Dynasty. Initially, they were only regarded as salt and tea vouchers. As they were used for a long time, they were used as money. In the past, they were all issued by the government. Only recently have larger banks issued them. On the Bund of Shanghai, known for its prosperity, the variety of Chinese and foreign banknotes is too numerous to list. Here are some interesting anecdotes about banknotes to amuse readers.</p>
<p>In the past, there was a young master who liked to frequent brothels. He was extravagant and flaunted his wealth, and he was also competitive and arrogant. One evening, the young master was...</p>

<p>The eighth day. Gave a lecture at the National Language School. Mr. Ke Dawen from Fujian came specifically to promote the National Language Unification Movement. I strongly support this because there is a major obstacle here: there are many small groups that cannot be unified. Each group is based on its own dialect and runs its own schools. It is difficult to gather for events. This is also because the lack of a common language divides their strength. However, I believe that if the hundreds of temples here could have idle monks first learn the national language and then unite to give lectures every week, and also teach the common people to read, then in a few years, it would not only raise the cultural level of the Chinese but also spread Buddhism to the local people. Wouldn't that be a great thing? Unfortunately, most monks are illiterate and do not understand what Buddhism is. A few monks only recite scriptures and worship idols to gain alms from illiterate women. Alas. I think that Catholicism also originally worshipped idols, just like monks. Since Luther changed to destroy temples and remove idols, and lay preachers (Martin Luther Married Cathrine Bira), it has become today's Christianity, using scientific methods and approaching society. Because there are no idols to guard, pastors and their wives must use science to engage with society and build a society that assimilates with humanity. Monks, because they have temples and idols to guard, can earn alms that people naturally send, and thus become lazy and no longer care about the world, resulting in a hypnotic superstition. The harm of temples and idols to the development of Buddhism means that the image law must be eliminated. Baiwen established the Sangha system to teach and transform the community, but today's lack of progress is also due to this. Truly, advantages and disadvantages are born together, and it is not easy to discuss.</p>
<p>On the ninth day, I want to study some of the strange customs here. First, it is extremely hot here, but many people wear felt hats, the kind that Shanghai people wear in winter. Second, very few people carry fans. Third, according to Cantonese custom, when guests arrive, they rarely offer a washbasin and towel to greet them. This is also the case here. Fourth, because it is hot here, drinking tea is very important. But people here use extremely small teacups everywhere, about the size of wine glasses, to serve guests. After drinking, they pour again. This is not economical in terms of time. I find these four things very strange, and after much research, I could not find the reason. Later, I realized that people rarely carry fans because the slope land has a lot of wind, constantly day and night. But when you go to a small shop, it is still hot. It should also be because of a lack of promotion. There are also many people selling fans in the market, but few people use them. The locals told me, "Those born in the heat do not know the heat. You are worrying too much." I learned that the habit of drinking tea with small cups originated from the fact that the Min people are very particular about tea tasting. To respect guests, they use a small teapot placed in a porcelain dish, with two small cups. All are very exquisite. Each person has a teapot and two cups that they can pour and drink themselves, so it does not seem wasteful. Over time, it has become a public teapot with small cups for pouring, which is too clumsy. This is a case of misinformation leading to great inconvenience. This custom of tea tasting is very valuable. Japan learned from the people of Fujian. But there is one interesting thing: an addiction to tea tasting can also ruin one's family, even more than opium. Tea addicts use very expensive tea, several yuan per ounce, and gather with friends day and night to drink it, leading to the ruin of families worth ten thousand gold. It is also laughable. In all things, nothing should be excessive. Therefore, Confucius spoke of the Doctrine of the Mean, and Aristotle spoke of the Golden Mean. But today, people who do not have tea habits still use expensive tea with small teacups, which is a great mistake. Moreover, the porcelain is not from Jiangxi, and the cups are also inferior. They should be improved urgently. It is very hot here, but towels are not used to serve guests. Some say they are afraid of spreading germs, because Cantonese customs fear leprosy. But I always think it is neurotic. A friend who has been here for a long time says that it has become a habit and they don't notice it. However, there is one good thing: because there is wind here, the sweat stops after sitting for a short time. Only the matter of wearing felt hats in the tropics is incomprehensible. But since I have come to this place, I have no choice but to wear them because there are no straw hats anywhere. Westerners wear thick, white hats. In short, all four of the above matters should be reformed. First, felt hats should be replaced with straw hats. Second, people should carry fans. Third, towels should be offered to guests. Fourth, tea must be drunk with large cups. This should be done using a promotional method. Perhaps then it will be possible.</p>
<p>smoking. He had run out of paper cigarettes, and because it was late at night, there was nowhere to buy them. The young master was angry and took out several ten-yuan banknotes from his pocket, rolled them up and used them to smoke. He looked around to show off his extravagance, which made onlookers look askance.</p>
<p>Since the issuance of banknotes, people have found them lightweight and easy to carry, so they are actually used in transactions. However, the country bumpkins have simple ideas. Whenever they encounter a transaction, they must have hard currency. Most of them are unwilling to accept banknotes. It has even been said that those who use banknotes in our cities are regarded as people in the ledger of ghosts, which is so absurd that it is laughable.</p>
<p>On banknotes, one often sees idlers scribbling randomly, which is annoying. However, there are also poems and proverbs written on the blank edges of the banknotes, satirizing, scolding, and expressing everything. However, the banknotes are cold and indifferent, which cannot be denied. No wonder poor scholars complain.</p>
<p>News from the Publishing World: The Guanhai Art Journal, edited by the Guanhaitan Art Society at 1303 Lafayette Road, Shanghai, has been published. The content is extremely rich, such as the writings, calligraphy, and paintings of Chen Tao'an, Zhu Guwei, Ye Yuhu, and Di Pingzi, all of which are exquisitely beautiful. The entire book is printed on glazed printing paper. The price is thirty cents per copy. It is sold at Tan Yin Lu Bookstore on Sanma Road, Shanghai.</p>

<p>Chapter Ten: Red Flames Soar, Bordello Praises Filial Daughter, Red Carpet Welcomes Famous Actors</p>
<p>That day, Liu Yinbo's friend went to Mei Lanfang to talk about it. He also said that on that day, many famous people, newspaper reporters, and travelers in Shanghai would be present. Before you go on stage, we can publicize it for you first. Mei Lanfang readily agreed. The play he was to perform was "Fen River Bay," which was one of his specialties. The person who was to partner with him was Wang Fengsheng, who had come with him. Originally, Liu Yinbo was a very social person. He himself was willing to socialize with others. Now that he had something going on, people came to socialize with him. In addition, now that they heard this startling news that the famous actor Mei Lanfang, who had been hired from Beijing with a large sum of money by the local theater, would perform a private performance here before going on stage, it was enough to cause a sensation. Because they had always heard people from Beijing and the newspaper advertisements say how good the famous actor Mei Lanfang was. Now he had also come to Shanghai. The newspapers published large advertisements, with the words "Resting for a few days, choosing a lucky day to go on stage" written below. People were wondering why the old theater owners were selling the show and waiting to perform. Now that he had arrived, he could go on stage. So he had to put on many airs. Now that they heard that Liu Yinbo was getting married, he would first go on stage at Wei Chun Yuan. Everyone wanted to see him first. Therefore, people who usually did not come out to socialize were now coming out to socialize in order to see Mei Lanfang's performance. Many relatives and friends who Liu Yinbo had not sent invitations to bother sent a gift and came in person to congratulate him in order to see Mei Lanfang's performance. In the middle of the hall of Wei Chun Yuan, there was a pool, where forty tables of wine could be placed. On both sides, more than ten tables of wine could be placed. Already, more than fifty tables of wine could be placed. However, the congratulatory guests continued to arrive. Upstairs was the place to entertain female guests, and more than twenty tables of wine were placed there. People who came later had to wait for the people who had come before to finish before they could be seated. However, many people did not come to eat wine, but rather to see the performance. At eight or nine o'clock, a group of Mei Lanfang supporters escorted Mei Lanfang and his party to the front. At this time, there was a great commotion, and everyone felt that they had no mood to eat wine. Zuo Shichen was nearsighted, so he sat at a table on the front row along the edge. Today's groom, Liu Yinbo, had known Mei Lanfang in Beijing. He was not a member of the Mei Lanfang supporters, but many of them were his friends. Today, he guided Mei Lanfang and introduced him to many friends. When he reached Zuo Shichen, he said, "This is Mr. Zuo Shichen." Zuo Shichen looked at Mei Lanfang and shook hands with him. He was indeed handsome and worthy of the reputation of a jade person. It was truly:</p>

<h3 id="e98">The Exchange Rate in Shanghai Falls Due to Influx of Capital <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Banks Close Early for the Horse Races</p>
<p>Yesterday was the day of the foreign Spring Horse Races. Foreign banks closed for half a day as usual, and some Chinese banks also closed. Therefore, the market was sluggish. As for the reason for the decline in the Shanghai exchange rate, it was only because the funds that merchants had previously sent to buy tea and miscellaneous grains were now being returned to Shanghai, resulting in an oversupply in the market. As a result, the rate fell every day. Yesterday afternoon, it had already fallen to within 0.02, with the morning rate at 0.072 and the afternoon rate at 0.071975, which was 0.00075 weaker than the morning rate of the previous day. The overnight money market was clearly in good order. All surplus funds were used to offset overdrafts, except for those needed by customers. Therefore, the money market slightly rebounded, and the overnight money rate immediately rose. Yesterday morning it was 0.014, and in the afternoon it was 0.012. The amount of remittances made was 1,081,000 in the morning and 1,285,000 in the afternoon. The amount of banknotes in the morning was 20,000, and there was no activity in the afternoon. The amount of banknotes in the outside market was 122,000 in the morning and 79,000 in the afternoon. The amount of silver dollars in the morning was 145,000 and 175,000 in the afternoon. Bank transactions amounted to 600,000 in the morning. In the afternoon, due to the holiday, there was little activity. The receipts and payments between foreign bank accounts were over 800,000, and the inflow and outflow of banknotes were over 1,000,000. The receipts and payments of silver dollars were not covered due to the closing of banks in the afternoon. The receipts and payments of foreign bank drafts by money shops were over 5,700,000, and the receipts and payments of silver bank drafts were over 31,000,000. The amount of foreign currency drafts was over 1,200,000, and the amount of silver currency drafts was over 2,400,000. The amount of foreign currency borrowing was over 500,000. The receipts and payments of remittances from various places were over 900,000. Small money shops exchanged banknotes and sold remittances of 400,000 to 500,000. Over 2,000,000 arrived yesterday, but the outflow was limited. The market for subsidiary coins: Jiangnan small silver coins were 0.0628 in both the morning and afternoon markets, with transactions only in the morning market of 2,000 jiao. Guangdong small silver coins were also 0.0599375 in both the morning and afternoon markets, with transactions of 125,000 jiao in the morning and 15,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins rose by 1,500 yuan to 399,500 yuan.</p>

<p>The interest rate for last month (April) has been decided recently. The interest rate is 2.95 taels, and the overdue interest is added according to the base rate of 4.5 qian. Therefore, the highest overdue interest is only 10.05 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Reasons for the Decline in Silk Cocoon Shipments <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>This year, the total amount of silver dollars shipped out of Shanghai for the purchase of silk cocoons is less than four to five million, which is less than half of the previous years. There are several reasons for this decline: (1) People's hearts are not as good as in the past, and bandits are rampant. Cash is often robbed on the way. Recently, it was heard that a large batch of cash from a silk factory in Xibu bound for Hankou to buy cocoons was robbed, resulting in huge losses. Generally, cocoon merchants do not dare to take the risk. Therefore, recently, silver dollars that have already been purchased are being returned, resulting in an extremely cold and unusual cocoon market. (2) The silkworm production in various ports is generally not good, either due to the silkworm eggs, the cold weather, the war, or the feeding of the leaves. The overall results are not satisfactory anywhere. Therefore, many cocoon kilns have not been rented out, and many cocoon merchants have not arrived. This has caused the farmers who raise silkworm cocoons to complain bitterly. (3) The financial sector is unwilling to lend money for the preparation of funds for cocoon merchants. As a result, those who want to engage in this business are unable to obtain capital and can only listen helplessly. Recently, it has been heard that cocoon funds in various places are often robbed, and the risks are worrying. Most people dare not take the risk. Even those who are bold enough to do it cannot do so because the financial sector is unwilling to lend money rashly. Therefore, the market has become deserted.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Gold Market Declines Again During the Spring Horse Races <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Fluctuations of over Two Taels: Yesterday, Monday, was the first day of the foreign Spring Horse Races. The Gold Exchange opened at 8:35 AM and closed at 11:30 AM. The afternoon market was closed because the banks were closed. The gold price was weak, but it was strong at first and then weak, fluctuating by over two liang. The foreign exchange rate changed from stable to weak, and there were not many transactions. There was an oversupply among the brokers. Companies such as Yuan Cheng, Yong Fu Chang, and Xu Chang sold, while Shun Li, Wan Xing, and Heng Xing bought. The price was slightly higher in the morning, because the exchange rate rose slightly, and people's confidence was boosted. However, large investors were not moved. However, later, large investors tended to sell, and the exchange rate was still weak, so it was difficult to hold the price. The price fell from over 506 taels to 504 taels. However, there were fluctuations of several qian to one or two liang at times. The closing price was over 504 taels.</p>
<p>Opening Price Slightly Higher: The price of British silver and the silver price rose by 1/8, the price of American and Canadian silver rose by 1/16, and the opening price of gold for June was 506.2 taels, which was 0.6 qian higher. The demand was also high, so the price rose to 6.4 qian, and people's confidence was strong. However, in an instant, all companies sold, causing the price to be lowered. The Japanese companies bought gold from Zhejiang for 1.056875 taels for June, and Sumitomo bought 1.048125 taels for August, and also bought forward British gold at 11.25 pence, so the price gradually decreased by two taels. When the leading price was announced, it was 504.34 taels, then 4.2 qian. The listed price did not change. The internal market was weak. Japanese gold for June was available for purchase at 1.05625 taels. Later, Shun Li, Heng Xing, and hedging companies bought it, and the price went up 0.7 to 0.8 qian. Mitsui bought forward British gold at 11.1875 pence, and Datong bought it for June at 11.125 pence, so the price increased by another 0.3 to 0.4 qian, reaching 5.34 taels at 10:00. After that, there were slight fluctuations.</p>
<p>Closing Price Down 1.31 Taels: Zhi Feng Yong and others all sold, and small investors followed suit, so the foreign exchange rate became weak again. The forward British gold was not easy to sell at 11.1875 pence and had to be 11.25 pence. The market turned weak and fell into a sluggish state, gradually falling by over one tael. The final price fell to 504 taels. The closing price at noon was 4.3 qian, which was 1.3 qian lower than the end of last week (the 3rd). The highest price in the half-day was 6.4 qian and the lowest price was 4 qian, a difference of 2.4 qian. The quoted price was still 515.4 taels. The Japanese gold quoted price did not change, but 11 taels were still being pressed for May and 6 taels for June. The opening price for spot goods in the morning was 6.3 qian, and the closing price at noon was 4.1 qian.</p>
<p>Dalian Occupies a Bullish Position: Regarding the buying and selling among brokers, Da De Cheng, Shun Li, Wan Xing, Yuan Yu Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Sen Chang Yong, and the spot hedging companies all bought, while Yuan Cheng Yong, Xiang Feng, Xiang Yu, Fu Chang, Tai Xing, and Xu Chang all sold. Yuan Tai, Zhi Feng Yong, Tong Tai Chang, and Yi Chang had inconsistent transactions. The Dalian gang bought a total of over 2,000 lots and sold 200 to 300 lots, and now occupies a bullish position. The Cantonese gang had a small number of transactions. The spot hedging companies slightly bought and sold the exchange.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Foreign Exchange Rate Initially Stable and Then Weak <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Gold Companies Sell to Hedge Positions</p>
<p>Banks Have Little Appetite</p>
<p>Yesterday was the day of the foreign Spring Horse Races, and banks were open for half a day as usual. As for the UK, the US, and India, there were no cables due to the start of the week. The markets in Yokohama and Kobe were stagnant. The Fong Company announced its prices half an hour earlier, at 9:00 AM. The exchange rates for all currencies remained unchanged. However, the internal exchange rates for the UK, the US, and Japan were initially stable, but then seemed to weaken. The gold price was low. Comparing the closing price at noon with the previous Saturday, the pound rose by 0.0625, the US dollar rose by 0.125, and the Japanese yen fell by 0.125. Chinese speculators and gold companies sold slightly, but banks had little appetite. About 50,000 to 60,000 pounds were sold, which were bought by Sumitomo, McCarly, Mitsui, and Datong. 100,000 US dollars were also sold to Hua Bi and Zheng Jin. About 100,000 Japanese yen were sold, which were slightly absorbed by Zhejiang Industrial and Sumitomo. Some were also bought for 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, which were sold by Taiwan Mitsui. The Dalian gang also sold slightly to hedge positions. There was no market in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The internal market for the pound only fluctuated by 0.0625. In the morning, the asking price for May was 1 shilling and 11 pence, and the buying price was 11.0625 pence. The asking price for June was 11.0625 pence, and the buying price was 11.125 pence. The asking price for July was 11.125 pence, and the buying price was 11.1875 pence. Hua Bi bought 5,000 pounds for June at 11.125 pence, which was bought by Hua Yi. Then, Sumitomo bought 5,000 for July at 0.25. McCarly bought 5,000 at the same price.

<h3 id="e104">The Continuing Sharp Decline in Bond Prices <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Trading Reaches 11.5 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market in Shanghai was very quiet in terms of spot transactions. The futures market, however, saw significant fluctuations in bond prices, leading to very active trading. The biggest price swings were related to issues such as consolidation, demobilization, and tariff adjustments. At the start of the morning, strong selling pressure caused bond prices to fall sharply. The selling pressure remained dominant throughout the morning and afternoon sessions, leading to the weakest market prices. These prices were about two yuan lower than the previous week. Later, market sentiment stabilized somewhat, and the selling pressure eased slightly. At the same time, there was a slight increase in buying to cover positions, which caused prices to fluctuate higher. As a result, compared to the previous week, besides the 96 Finance bonds, which remained mostly unchanged, consolidation and demobilization bonds continued to fall by about one yuan. Other bonds fell by amounts ranging from five to seven cents. Spot transactions for the entire day totaled only 15,000 yuan, while futures transactions reached 11.5 million yuan. Among futures, tariff bonds accounted for the largest share, totaling over 3.3 million yuan. Consolidation bonds reached over 2.6 million yuan, Rehabilitation bonds totaled about 1.7 million yuan, Continued Big Bonds 560,000 yuan, Continued Rolled Bonds over 800,000 yuan, and Demobilization bonds about 500,000 yuan. 96 Finance bonds amounted to over 200,000 yuan, while 7-year Finance bonds remained very quiet.</p>

<p>The yarn market was weak in the morning but rose in the afternoon. Actual yarn sales are expanding, and both Sichuan and Guangdong merchants are showing strong buying interest. If actual sales can continue uninterrupted, there should be a chance for prices to rise. However, overseas cotton yarn market conditions are generally trending downward, so most retail investors are inclined to sell. The rise and fall of the yarn market will depend on sales volume.</p>
<p>In the afternoon session, spot sales drove up the futures yarn market. The market opened lower in the morning due to the weakness of overseas cotton, and the market sentiment was weak. Retail investors sold off, with prices falling by two, three, or four cents across all months. However, trading volume was very low. In the afternoon, news that Sichuan and Guangdong merchants were purchasing spot yarn in large quantities tightened the market, and there were quite a few short covering trades. Prices rebounded by three, five, or six cents across all months. Total trading volume for the day was 9,600 bales. The closing prices for the afternoon session are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Month, Closing Price, Change, Open Interest, Month, Closing Price, Change, Open Interest</p>
<p>May, 151.8, Up 0.23, 6,900, August, 152.7, Up 0.22, 1,100</p>

<p>July, 152.3, 0.12, 6,500, October, 153.5, 0.12, 700</p>
<p>Over 3,000 bales of spot yarn were sold to Sichuan and Guangdong. The sales of spot yarn are still good, and merchants from both provinces are showing strong buying interest. Throughout the day, various merchants bought 3,710 bales, while domestic traders took in 470 bales. The market was flat. The largest buyer was Sichuan, accounting for 1,700 bales, followed by Guangdong with 1,265 bales, Shantou with 140 bales, Yunnan with 220 bales, Fujian with 50 bales, Xiamen with 60 bales, Tianjin with 70 bales, inland areas with 125 bales, and other merchants with 80 bales.</p>

<p>The cotton market is very weak, and the downward trend is quite strong. This is mainly due to sluggish actual sales and the downward trend in overseas cotton. Speculation in near-month East Cotton contracts, rumors of large-scale deliveries, and an increasingly weak market situation in the current month have caused panic among retail investors, leading to a decline in market prices. However, the stance of the Hubei merchants remains strong, and they refuse to change their position.</p>
<p>Futures Cotton Prices Fall by Two or Three Cents. The market opened lower due to the downward trend in overseas cotton, and retail investors sold off, causing the market to weaken. Prices fell by two to three and a half cents across all months. In the afternoon, profit-taking led to short covering, and prices rebounded by five fen to one cent. The total trading volume for the day was 36,700 piculs. The closing prices for the Hubei Standard Cotton are listed on the left.</p>

<p>The Mumbai market was quiet last week. Prices fell slightly following the decline in American cotton. Futures trading was sluggish due to political uncertainty. Export demand was weak. Japanese manufacturers showed little interest except for cheap spot goods that they needed. As for China, transactions were limited to Omra cotton. France had some transactions for low-priced Omra cotton. Local manufacturers actively purchased various standard cotton grades. The weekly statistics are attached below: (Unit: bales)</p>

<p>The Liverpool spot market was very quiet last week. Futures trading was peaceful. The actions of the U.S. Department of Agriculture did not have much impact here. However, the situation in India and the impact on Lancashire have lowered prices. The weekend sales by Indian merchants and retail investors were absorbed by the industry, which strengthened the market slightly. However, overall, the market remains bearish. The Egyptian cotton market was calm and uneventful.</p>

<p>Yesterday, there was still no change in the silk market for foreign firms in Shanghai. Yokohama raw silk remained sluggish. European and American silk mills had no demand for raw silk. Yesterday's telegram on Chinese silk showed no change. Chinese merchants adopted a passive attitude. Only Shen Yu and others purchased 20 bales of yellow silk from factories, and Xin Shichang purchased 10 bales of white silk from factories. Prices generally trended lower.</p>

<p>Unrest Persists in Various Regions, Many Cocoon Firms Cancel Leases</p>
<p>Result: No Progress</p>
<p>The spring cocoon season in various regions of Jiangsu and Zhejiang is approaching. However, due to rampant banditry in various regions, silk cocoon merchants dare not travel to collect cocoons with cash. In addition, unfavorable weather conditions have led to poor cocoon yields, and sluggish overseas silk sales mean that fresh silk is still being sold off at low prices. As a result, most of the cocoon firms that had leased cocoon trading houses have temporarily declared their cancellation of leases, causing widespread panic among cocoon trading houses in various regions. Therefore, they came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to invite silk cocoon merchants to hold a joint meeting to discuss solutions. The result was that, given the current situation, they made no progress. The Silk Cocoon General Association and the Silk Mill Trade Association have sent telegrams to the National Government, outlining the dire state of the silk cocoon industry, requesting that measures be taken to provide relief and maintain the industry.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the tea market for foreign firms in Shanghai was quite lively. Several hundred chests of new Zhenmei green tea samples produced by local tea factories have been launched on the market. Among them, Sui'an tea was opened by Tongfu Foreign Firm at a top price of 104 taels, about five or six taels lower than last year. Although the overall market sentiment was not too bad, only Tongfu Foreign Firm showed strong buying interest among the British firms. The rest mostly adopted a wait-and-see attitude. According to observations by general tea merchants, it is feared that the market will be difficult to sustain.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Stagnant and Weak Sales in Grain and Rice Market <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>About ten ships arrived at Zhabei yesterday. Sales were limited, with only a few top-grade Japonica varieties selling briskly. Second-grade Zhongguan Japonica was extremely sluggish, and the goods have been unowned for a long time, making them even less desirable. Although there were several transactions throughout the day, prices had to be lowered by half to two jiao. Supplies of late-season Bo rice were scarce, and sales remained sluggish. Large quantities were slightly reduced. Transactions in Yangdu and other top-grade varieties were few. General-grade rice was slightly inquired about by customers. Retail sales were very slow, and buying interest in Yinyuan rice was also quiet. The trend for Baiyuan rice was quite flat.</p>
<p>A small amount of rice arrived in the Hunan River area of Shanghai, and market conditions were generally flat. Stores showed strong interest in Changzhou and Wuxi Japonica, but lower grades were sluggish. Prices were high and stable, while lower grades were soft. Sales of Suzhou and Tongxiang machine-milled rice were average, and there was no significant buying interest from rural areas. Prices varied slightly. The situation for early-season Bo rice from southern counties was turning stable due to slow arrivals and sales. Prices remained unchanged. Small quantities of Yangdu top-grade rice arrived. Local stores selectively purchased them, and the market showed neither prosperity nor decline. Demand for Baiyuan rice was weak, and inventories remained high, resulting in a weak market trend. Prices were also high and flat, while lower grades were discounted.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Active Flour Sales, Prices Rising <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Significant Increase of 1.75 Cents Recently</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market suddenly experienced a sharp increase this month. It is currently the off-season, and price fluctuations depend entirely on actual sales. If the sales do not pick up, the high market value will naturally be short-lived. Otherwise, if demand increases, the market will inevitably surge again. It was evident in the previous week that prices would not fall further this month. In terms of sales to the north, Tianjin needs 40,000 to 50,000 bags per day (yesterday's price was 3.685 yuan). Before the off-season, Shanghai flour had sales of one million bags. Nanjing and the Yangtze River area are buying flour for military use or to meet demands caused by rice shortages. Therefore, as sales have picked up, manufacturers have raised prices, which is expected. As a result, standard opening prices had to be raised sharply. However, based on the current situation, prices will not exceed five cents to a guan, as manufacturers are only seeking to cover costs and do not want to burden the people. As a result, the highest increase this month was 2.4725 taels, before falling slightly. Compared to the previous week, prices were up 1.75 cents. Forward-month contracts were showing positive trends, with June at 5 cents, July, August, and September at 2.5 cents, and October not yet opened.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Spot Wheat Trading at 13,000 Bags <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, wheat futures generally fluctuated within a range, showing a slightly weaker trend. This was due to the weather turning clear again, and foreign wheat prices were reported to be lower by two, three, or four jiao. Therefore, market sentiment was generally sluggish. However, traders from inland regions remained firm. Therefore, although there was an opportunity to push prices lower, the extent of the decline was limited. As a result, the June contract was down slightly by two fen compared to the previous weekend, the July contract was unchanged, the August contract was down slightly by one fen, and the September and October contracts were unchanged. Spot wheat supplies remained abundant due to continued arrivals, and prices trended stable. However, sales remained brisk due to better flour sales. Qingjiangpu, South Xuzhou, Xuzhou, and Bengbu wheat were priced at 4.92 taels, and Henan wheat was priced at 4.4 taels, with a total of over 13,000 bags traded. Fufeng and Shenda bought 3,500 bags, and the rest was bought by Fuxin.</p>

<p>Yesterday, foreign rice was inquired about by customers in the morning, and prices rose by more than one jiao. However, customer demand stopped at noon, and the market fell back by almost one jiao. In the afternoon, Hankou merchants continued to buy actively, and market prices rose again by about one jiao. As a result, prices rose by five or six fen to more than one jiao, especially for small ground rice, which was the focus of attention for Hankou merchants, with a significant increase of 1.5 jiao. More than 20,000 units were traded, priced at 14.90 to 14.65 yuan. 1,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice were priced at 15.62 yuan, and 1,500 bags of No. 2 rice were priced at 14.95 to 14.7 yuan. 500 bags of Mintang rice were priced at 15.05 to 14.85 yuan, and 300 bags of large ground rice were priced at 14.58 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Dalian soybean cake futures strengthened due to recent short covering and customer purchases. Telegrams from the Dalian side to Jiaozhou reported good news, but then loosened yesterday. The trend remains positive. The forward months strengthened slightly by 0.25 to 0.5 fen due to selling by local firms. The May contract closed higher by one fen. The soybean cake market is unlikely to fall significantly in the short term.</p>
<p>The standard current-month soybean market was slightly active. It opened at 5.45 to 5.46 taels in the morning and afternoon, and buying interest was acceptable. However, a telegram from Dalian reporting weaker prices caused concern, and the market may turn weaker when it opens today.</p>

New York sugar futures for May were at 1.52, down one cent, September at 1.61, up six cents, December at 1.70, up five cents, and March of next year at 1.76, also up four cents. Java spot and futures sugar prices showed little change. Trading in the association market was very sparse. Number 24 Dutch raw white sugar was heavily offered at 7.075 taels, but there were few buyers. Later, there were some transactions at 7.05 taels. Number 20 medium white sugar was at 6.95 taels, and the market was unremarkable. Daily trading in Japanese sugar was also sluggish. UT grade was at 7.55 taels, YP grade at 7.725 taels, and M grade at 7.625 taels. The market was also flat. Transactions for grade contracts were very scarce. Unified grade rock sugar was offered at 5.9 taels and was considered relatively attractive. Over 200 bags of domestically produced Huanggang Qing sugar arrived yesterday but had not yet been sampled, so there were no transactions. However, demand was still active.</p>

The Shanghai 5/5 Anniversary Commemoration Committee convened a meeting of representatives from all sectors at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at 9:00 AM. The meeting was attended by thousands of party members and representatives from all sectors. As it was Monday, the expanded weekly memorial service was held first, with Fan Zhengbo as the chair and Xu Yefu as the master of ceremonies. After the ceremony, music was played to open the meeting, chaired by Chen Dezheng. Representatives from the Municipal Executive Committee, Pan Gongzhan, Dong Hangbai, and Lu Jingshi, delivered speeches in succession. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Agenda: (1) Opening, (2) Music, (3) Singing of the Party Song, (4) Bow to the National Flag and the Portrait of the General Manager, (5) The Chairman Respectfully Reads the General Manager's Will, (6) Silent Tribute, (7) Chairman's Report, (8) Speech by the Representative of the Municipal Party Department, (9) Speeches, (10) Slogans, (11) Music, (12) Adjournment.</p>
<p>Meeting Chairman (Presidium): Zhang Qun, Chen Dezheng, Pan Gongzhan, Fan Zhengbo, Wang Yansong, Tong Hangbai, Ma Zhiying, Lu Jingshi.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Chen Dezheng delivered the opening remarks, stating that the party comrades have designated this day as an eternal memorial day for the party and the country. There are several points we should recognize on this memorial day. First, the environment on that day was dangerous and difficult, and the General Manager rose from that dangerous environment and fought against it. Looking at our current environment, it is no less dangerous than it was on that day. Do our comrades want to commemorate the General Manager by learning his fearless spirit to save the nation and the country from danger? This is the first point to explain. Second, many warlords like Ge Feng are stirring up trouble to satisfy their desires. In the past, the Beiyang warlord Wu Peifu was the representative, and now it is Ge Xishan and Feng Yuxiang. Do we want to awaken the people and unite the revolutionary masses to eliminate the current Beiyang warlords Ge Xishan and Feng Yuxiang? This is the second point. Third, Chen Jiongming communicated with the Beiyang warlords, hindering the General Manager, which led to Chen Jiongming's rebellion. The reason why the General Manager's Northern Expeditions failed several times was not because the revolutionary forces were weaker than the northern forces, but because counter-revolutionary forces were lurking within the revolutionary forces. Now, these counter-revolutionary forces are clearly represented by Wang Zhaoming, Chen Gongbo, Xie Chi, Xiang Lu, and others. Do we want to awaken the people and unite the masses to eliminate these counter-revolutionary elements? This is the third point. The most important significance of commemorating the General Manager's inauguration as the Extraordinary President is that we hope everyone will learn the General Manager's fearless spirit to eliminate the Beiyang warlords and save our country. Secondly, we need to explain that today the counter-revolutionary Communist Party is also commemorating the birthday of their ancestor Karl Marx. Today, our memorial day also happens to coincide with this counter-revolutionary memorial day. Our purpose is to save our nation and enable our nation to survive freely and independently, and not to become appendages of red and white imperialism. What we are doing today is not only saving the nation but also building democracy and people's livelihood. Everyone should recognize that the Communist Party does not want a nation. When we commemorate the General Manager who fought for the nation, we use our strength to eliminate the Communist Party, which is against the interests of the nation. Therefore, when we commemorate the General Manager's inauguration as the Extraordinary President, we must strive to eliminate the Beiyang warlords, save the country and the nation, and also eliminate the Communist Party, which is against the interests of the nation. This is the most important significance of today's commemoration. I hope all comrades will continue the General Manager's fearless spirit and work hard to make China truly free and equal so that compatriots can live and work in peace. The report is complete.</p>

<p>To Be Signed in Beijing Today</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Diplomatic Authorities Journeyed to Beijing Last Night</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement is scheduled to be signed in Beijing this morning. At 6:00 PM this afternoon, it will be announced simultaneously in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Tokyo. Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting was originally scheduled to go to Beijing yesterday afternoon, but he changed his plans and took the night express train to Beijing last night due to some matters. The Japanese Acting Minister to China, Shigemitsu Aoi, also took the night train to Beijing at 11:00 PM yesterday. He was accompanied by the Commercial Attaché of the Japanese Embassy, Yokotake, and Secretaries Moriya, Horiuchi, Morishima, and Hayashi, as well as Vice-Consul Okazaki and nine clerks.

<h3 id="e122">Hong Kong Merchants Manipulating <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai-Hong Kong Exchange Rate</p>
<p>Total Amount Reaches 200 Million Taels</p>
<p>Wenhui Bao reports that according to Hong Kong press reports from reliable sources, speculation in Shanghai-Hong Kong exchange rates has been rampant recently. Several Hong Kong merchants are extremely well-informed about exchange market news. Recently, they suddenly made large-scale purchases, totaling as much as 200 million taels. It is difficult to predict the future trend of the exchange market, but it can be said that there will be changes soon that will prevent these speculators from taking such risks in vain. However, with the sharp drop in the silver market, various sectors have already been greatly affected. If speculators continue to manipulate the market, the future may be even more unimaginable, which is truly unfortunate for the industrial and commercial sectors.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Customs Official Talks About Shanxi's Yan Xishan's Tax Interception <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Hoping He Will Know the Opportunity and Stop</p>
<p>Yan Xishan's interception of Tianjin customs duties has aroused opposition from all circles, both Chinese and foreign. Now, according to a senior official of the Inspectorate General of Customs, this matter is also mentioned, saying that in the past ten years or so, domestic wars have been incessant. Most of the central administrative organs have been broken and incomplete in the event of war. The only one that has been able to maintain its integrity from beginning to end is the Customs. This is because all parties understand the integrity of customs administration and dare not lightly take great risks related to national economy and people's livelihood, not only because it is managed by foreigners. The customs revenue each year, in addition to offsetting foreign debts and indemnities, is used as a fund to guarantee domestic debts. These domestic debts are entirely in the hands of merchants and people, and the banking sector especially uses them as reserves. The total amount of debt is no less than 100 million yuan, which is the basis for the national economy. If the fund for domestic debts is affected by politics, the national finance and the people's economy will suffer a major blow. The government, merchants and people will all suffer. Therefore, in times of intense political strife, people are reluctant to destroy other organizations, but they can pay special attention to maintaining customs administration, because they fear that once destroyed, even if they are lucky enough to win and enter the central government, they will also be restricted by others and unable to stop them. Therefore, Yan Xishan of Shanxi, even if not for the sake of the national economy and people's livelihood, and China's foreign credit, should also consider his own future, and it is hoped that he will know the opportunity and retreat, and not rashly engage in it.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Today <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>

The inaugural hall has also been newly decorated by the preparatory committee members Xu Yunhui and others. The special district has a vast territory and a large population, and is the essence of the city. Taxpaying citizens should have a cohesive group with sufficient strength, so that there is hope for the progress of citizens' welfare. The Municipal Party Department, after several solemn studies, in order to unify the organization and expand its strength, resolutely ordered the dissolution of various classified organizations in the city (such as the Merchants' Association, etc.), and on the one hand, selected 39 citizens in the city who are knowledgeable, experienced and have a long-standing reputation in the community as members to be responsible for the preparation. The list of all preparatory committee members is recorded below:</p>

<p>Yu Yangsheng, Qiu Jiabiao, Chen Jicheng, Zhang Xianfang, Zheng Chengqing Inauguration Declaration China is unfortunate, defeated in the Opium War, resulting in unequal treaties, the so-called cession of land and indemnities, opening up of doors, tariff agreements, consular jurisdiction and other humiliating and humiliating rights, all began at that time. The imperialists of the world cited each other and competed to taste. In 1858, the renewal of the Sino-British trade treaty was the beginning of the concession. Since then, China has been in constant turmoil. Thieves and traitors have all used the concession as a refuge. This concession, which harbors dirt and accommodates filth, has become a haven for those who commit crimes. Gambling such as dog racing and roulette, kidnapping and robbery cases, the prevalence of opium, and the establishment of brothels have caused incalculable losses to the precious national currency. What I see and hear makes my heart ache. However, our two million citizens are content with temporary peace, forgetting the great shame of China, and are ignorant and unaware. They are bustling and noisy, like the deaf and dumb, willing to jump into the palms of their enemies, and lose the faces of Yan and Huang. Thinking of this, tears of blood fall. Alas, China is sinking, who can save the tide? I am born as a human being, how can I just feed like dogs and pigs? It is related to the country. The members of this association dare not follow the National Revolution and run around calling, awakening the people, standing together under the blue sky and white sun, and working hard for freedom and equality.

Now, at the beginning of the establishment of this association, I use my sincerity to tell my dearest compatriots who are citizens in the Shanghai Concession, please trace the roots and rise up courageously, understand the mission of this association, supervise the progress of this association, unite as one, and work together.

<h3 id="e131">Great Competition in Sino-American Shipping <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Osaka's Giant Ship Breaks and Loses Over One Million</p>
<p>The Pacific ship Alba, owned by the Japanese Osaka Company, a giant ship that travels the Sino-American line, with a load capacity of 10,000 net tons, sailing the Shanghai-Seattle route. Last time it came to Shanghai from the United States, it carried a large number of salted fish and other goods. When it traveled outside Yokohama Port, it encountered a strong wind and hit a reef. The hull was driven onto the reef. The company sent a ship to tow it. After more than a month of work, the ship was finally towed with cables. It was expected to pull it out in one fell swoop, but the front of the Alba was stuck in the reef and could not be pulled out. After the tugboat tried its best to pull it, the Alba broke into two pieces. The front half of the ship was still stuck on the rocks, and the rear half was towed into the sea, causing the ship to be completely sacrificed. Fortunately, the crew members were rescued first, so no one was injured. Of the goods loaded in Shanghai, a batch of salted fish could still be transferred, and other goods such as ink had completely melted into the sea. The ship was built after the European War and was the Osaka Company's largest and fastest ship, a sister ship to the Arimarenai Maru. This time, the accident caused a loss of more than one million yuan.</p>
<p>Kinei Maru Takes Over The company is building six high-speed giant ships to compete with British, American and Norwegian ships in Shanghai and New York on the Panama Canal to the Far East in order to compete for Sino-American transportation. Now, the company has changed its plan. Due to the accident of the Alba in the Pacific, it has decided to send the first of the six new ships, the Kinei Maru, to the Seattle route first. At the same time, because there are not many goods from China to the United States and our country's ship charter fee has been changed to the gold standard, the company has temporarily decided not to send the Pacific ship to Shanghai for five months to avoid tonnage tax. Now that the new ship has been completed, it has been decided to resume the Pacific route to Shanghai on July 1, and the Kinei Maru is scheduled to open its maiden voyage in mid-August.</p>
<p>New York Water Foot First Falls There are more than a dozen companies, including British Blue Funnel, Cheung Tai, Po Wo, Prince, Yih Tai, American Dollar, Balboa, and Norwegian Wheelock, that send ships on the Shanghai-New York route. During the previous silk rush in the Pacific, the export water foot on the New York line has also fallen. Now it is heard that Osaka will add six fast ships and will be able to open classes soon. British and American shipping companies, in order to maintain the equilibrium of their business in China and avoid being threatened by a major enemy, have decided to greatly reduce the import water foot from the United States to Shanghai before the Japanese ships are running. This is already being implemented. Generally, the freight for goods from the United States to Shanghai, which originally charged more than 6 jiao (a tenth of a yuan) of US dollars per hundred pounds of weight, has now been reduced to 3.5 to 4 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Japan Expands Trade with China <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Increased Purchases of Coarse Grains for Shipment to Japan Japan needs food every day. It relies entirely on shipments from China for relief, so there are often unscrupulous merchants who smuggle rice and grains for export in our country. Since the strict prohibition of food rice exports, Japan has increased its purchase of coarse grains in China. From October last year to the end of last month, the amount of Chinese coarse grains shipped to Japan in this half year was more than in the previous half year. According to statistics, 77,000 tons of wheat flour were shipped, an increase of 22,000 tons compared with the previous period; 28,000 tons of rapeseed were shipped, an increase of 14,000 tons compared with the previous period; 10,000 tons of sesame were shipped, an increase of 5,000 tons compared with the previous period; 9,000 tons of beans were shipped, a decrease of 5,000 tons compared with the previous period, because a large batch of goods was shipped from Dalian; 2,000 tons of chicken eggs were shipped, a decrease of 5,000 tons compared with the previous period; 40,000 tons of bran were shipped; and 10,000 tons of ramie were shipped. From this month, the amount of coarse grains shipped to Japan will be even more than in the previous period. Japanese merchants expect that from now until the end of September, they will need to ship 20,000 tons of coarse grains to the Orient. Therefore, from the 2nd of this month, Shanghai has added two more ships with a tonnage of 4,000 tons each to transport this cargo. The Zhenghai Steamship Company in the Yangtze River has increased the number of ships sailing to eleven to load coarse grains and other goods.</p>
<p>Encouraging the Import of Yarn and Cloth to China China is the largest market for Japan's cotton yarn and foreign cloth exports. Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, Jiaozhou, Guangzhou, and Xiamen all have shipments. However, in the past three months, the number of Japanese piece goods and cotton yarn shipped to Shanghai has not been as prosperous as in the previous months. In order to reduce the cost of yarn and cloth and make it easier to promote sales, the Japanese have first reduced the water foot for printing cotton to Japan by one yuan per ton as a fundamental development plan. However, after the fee reduction was implemented, the first ship from Japan to Shanghai has arrived in Shanghai. The ship carried more than 1,400 pieces of yarn and cloth, but there was no significant development. Now Japanese merchants are planning to ask the ships on the Japanese-Shanghai line to also reduce the water foot for yarn and cloth as the first step to encourage the promotion of trade with China. At the same time, various merchants have organized a large-scale inspection team to go to various parts of China to investigate the development of Japanese goods. This time, the Kyushu Daily News of Fukuoka Nakajima Town has launched a visiting group to Shanghai.

<h3 id="e133">Silk Cocoon Association Asks for Protection of the Cocoon Market <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Huang Xiaochen, chairman of the Jiang, Zhejiang and Anhui Silk Cocoon General Association, believes that the new cocoons in the interior will be on the market soon. Silk cocoon merchants are carrying money to set off for the purchase of fresh cocoons. However, the various prefectures are not peaceful. Therefore, he is referring to the measures in previous years and has submitted documents to the National Government and the governments of the three provinces of Jiang, Zhejiang and Anhui, ordering them to strictly protect them to ensure the safety of farmers and merchants. The original document to the National Government is recorded below: It is submitted for the protection of the cocoon market, early preparations, and reference to the measures in previous years. It is respectfully requested that you examine and approve the distribution to the governments of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui to order their subordinate units with cocoons to strictly protect them to ensure the safety of farmers and merchants. It is imperative to investigate the cocoon markets in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui, which are troubled by different climates and different times. Most of them open markets in the middle of May in the lunar calendar, before and after the Xiaoman solar term. The cocoon shops all open markets one after another, with Zhejiang being the earliest. Over the years, the General Association has formulated measures, submitted them to the government, and distributed them to the governments of the three provinces for protection, and distributed the printed protection measures to the troops and county public security agencies in various places for investigation and handling, so that they can be carefully protected. I am extremely grateful for this year's cocoon market. To be prudent in light of the social situation and in the meticulous protection, Zhou Wenan's tranquility only exists where the waterways are divergent and far away from the county. Brigands are not yet settled and are all vigilant. Most of the areas in Jiang and Zhejiang are water transportation areas, and silver goods are exchanged. It is not enough to prevent troubles from happening unless capable troops are dispatched to patrol along the way. The banditry is more serious in northern Anhui and other places, and protection is especially important. The cocoon shops in various places are mostly located in rural towns, and the military and police forces are not as strong as those in cities. Farmers carry cocoons to the shops, and cocoon merchants carry silver to collect cocoons. The roads they pass must be maintained with real strength to eliminate the invisible troubles. The General Association is responsible for planning ahead and listing each item that should be protected, such as loading and transporting cash and transporting cocoon packages, with reference to the past situation over the years, and respectfully asking the government to preside over the handling and approve the distribution to the governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui three months in advance, and quickly order the troops stationed in each place with cocoons and the county government to protect the army, the government, the water and land public security in accordance with the rules, and the General Association shall print multiple copies of the articles and methods, divide them into 100 copies per province, and present them to the three provincial governments for distribution to the county governments and military and police officers in charge of cocoon protection for investigation and handling. The reason for the early request for protection of the cocoon scarf is attached and the methods are submitted for your examination and record, and please order them to be followed, which is for the public convenience (the documents submitted to the three provinces of Jiang, Zhejiang and Anhui are roughly the same and omitted)</p>

<p>Six Lives Burned to Death</p>
<p>The Woman Was Exhausted After Childbirth</p>
<p>Pulling Her Children and Calling Her Daughters, She Could Not Take Care of Everything</p>
<p>When She Woke Them Up One by One to Escape</p>
<p>The Smoke Was Thick and There Was No Way Out</p>
<p>The lower floor of Dexing Cai's laundry and dyeing shop at No. 207 Huayuan Lane, outside Datongmen in the southern city, was rented to people who worked as bamboo weavers. At 3:00 a.m. yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out, and it spread rapidly, breaking through the roof and spreading to Huaxing firewood shop at No. 205 and Wanhe longan shop at No. 201. Fire trucks from various fire brigades drove to the scene to put out the fire, but the fire was fierce. The houses at these three addresses were all three-courtyard deep, and a total of nine houses were reduced to ashes. They were extinguished in time and did not spread. However, because it was late at night when the fire broke out, everyone was asleep. Although adults who were physically active all escaped the smoke and fire, Zhang Changbao, a tenant of the Huaxing firewood shop at No. 205, was from Jiangbei and worked as a foreman on the Dahua轮船 that ran on the Yangtze River. He had just set sail the day before yesterday and left his wife Zhang Guo (38 years old), daughter Daya (15 years old), son Pangzai (13 years old), son Dengsanzi (10 years old), son Xiaosanzi (8 years old), and son Maotou (half a month old) at home. She had not been out of confinement for long and was mentally exhausted. When she saw the fire, she woke up in shock, pulling her children and calling her daughters. Because there were so many children, she could not take care of everything. When she woke them up one by one to put on their clothes and escape, the fire had reached them and the smoke blocked the way. She was physically weak after childbirth and had no courage to break through the fire. She was worried about the children and could not go, so she pulled them together and was burned to death miserably. Yesterday morning, six bodies of all sizes were dug out, all with scorched heads, swollen bellies, and burst open. The scene was so tragic that it made people feel sad. The police station in District 1 is investigating and arresting the arsonist. In addition, it ordered the land chief Lu Rongde of the 16th shop to report to the local court for investigation. In the afternoon, at 4 o'clock, Prosecutor Liu and Inspector Xuan came to the scene to investigate and confirmed that they had been burned to death. The sub-landlord Wu Jucai complained about the previous situation, and said that her husband had not yet been informed. The prosecutor ordered her to collect the bodies on his behalf and wait for the arsonist to be brought to justice.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Undercover Detectives Misunderstand and Shoot <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>One Undercover Detective Died</p>
<p>The Pedestrian Killed Was Xu Renjie</p>
<p>The Two Bodies Were Autopsied Together Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The Police Station Gave Compensation to Both of Them</p>
<p>Four People Were Injured and Their Injuries Were Very Serious</p>
<p>The Xinzha Police Station has recently had cases of midnight robbery in its jurisdiction, especially in the Changsha Road and Guling Road area. Therefore, it dispatches patrolmen and undercover patrolmen to patrol every midnight. Unexpectedly, the detectives met on Changsha Road around half past midnight the day before yesterday, misunderstood each other, and shot each other, resulting in a tragedy. Three Chinese detectives and two undercover detectives were shot and injured. One of the undercover detectives died, and a pedestrian was killed by a stray bullet. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the person killed by the stray bullet was named Xu Renjie. Afterwards, the police station ordered the body to be taken to the Forensic Examination Office on Fieling Road together with the body of Chinese police officer Liu Shangwu, an undercover detective of No. 392. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Xu, commissioned by the Local Court of the Special District, came to the office to examine the body, ascended to his official position, and inquired about the situation at the time. According to Xu's father, Xu Shida, the deceased was his son, 23 years old, and worked in the stock exchange. He went out to buy things that day and died in an accident. According to Liu Wang, the wife of Liu, she is 32 years old, from Tianjin, and now lives at No. 118 Kang Nuot Road. My husband died in the line of duty, and I request preferential treatment. The head of the Xinzha Police Station reported that although the police officer died due to a misunderstanding, his loyalty to his duties has been demonstrated, and the Municipal Council should give preferential treatment in accordance with the regulations. As for the death of Xu Renjie, appropriate compensation should also be given. Prosecutor Xu then ordered Xu Shida and Liu Wang to execute a bond separately to receive the body for coffin burial, and ordered the police station to give compensation. However, the remaining three Chinese detectives and one undercover detective are still being treated in the hospital, and their injuries are serious, and they have not yet been out of danger.</p>

<p>Concubine Intends Poisoning</p>
<p>A bowl of poisonous congee as evidence, and a small bottle also highly suspicious. Zhang San, a native of Haizhou, yesterday filed a complaint with the Fifth District Third Precinct against his concubine, Zhang Zhao, stating that he lived at No. 19 Linping Road, Hujia Muqiao, and had been in a cohabiting relationship with the woman for four years. Now, because she has fallen in love with someone else, her heart has changed. On February 1st of this year, she secretly put medicine into the congee, intending to poison me to death. I took a bite and found it very bitter, so I quickly spat it out and asked her to taste it. Unexpectedly, she refused to eat it and said there was poison in it. I thought that since she hadn't tasted it, how could she know there was poison, which was clearly a plot to harm me. At the time, I intended to seize her, but my mother persuaded me, saying that since I hadn't seen her putting the poison in, I couldn't be sure. So I kept the congee in an iron basin. (He then presented the congee.) But afterwards, I just let it slide and didn't pursue the matter. Unexpectedly, when I woke up yesterday morning, a small bottle suddenly fell to the ground during an argument. I wanted to pick it up and look at it, but she quickly grabbed it and hid it, refusing to show it to anyone. I immediately questioned her, but she escaped. I suspect she is plotting something again, putting poison to harm me. So today, I found her and brought the case to you, asking for an investigation, etc. When questioned, she claimed to be 31 years old and denied any intention to harm, saying she was fleeing due to being abused, etc. The precinct, believing the case involved attempted murder, transferred both parties to the District Court for preliminary examination by the prosecutor, who ordered the congee to be tested for poisonous substances before further investigation.</p>

<p>Shanghai Market Shortage and High Prices</p>
<p>The climate in Southeast Asia is relatively hot, and silk shirts are now worn as clothing. Hangzhou silk from China is purchased and sold annually by Cantonese merchants in large quantities. Currently, this group has received telegrams from Singapore and other places, wanting to purchase several thousand bolts of Hangzhou silk. Therefore, the market price has risen from 6 jiao to 6 jiao 3 or 4. The stock of Hangzhou goods in Shanghai is weak, and if the demand is urgent, prices may rise further.</p>

<p>Regarding the Tang Pagoda in Beisi Temple, Pinghu County, Zhejiang, after Qi Qixiang of the Fourth District Party Department of the area submitted a proposal to demolish it, a certain Mr. Jing from Beijing sent a long letter to the county magistrate, urging him not to demolish it. Also, Wang Yiting's reply to a fellow Pinghu native's letter stated that the Ministry of Interior and the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs had both sent replies. The documents have been recorded and sent to Mr. Zhu Shisheng for preservation. The government has a specific responsibility to preserve historical sites, as is the case in all European and American countries. Now that the government has agreed not to demolish it, it should be repaired immediately. Furthermore, the Pinghu Association in Shanghai sent a letter to the county magistrate, Fang Ligong, stating that they were shocked to hear that someone had proposed demolishing and selling the Tang Pagoda in their hometown (omission). Whether this ancient pagoda should be preserved or destroyed, sold or repaired, depends on your Excellency's order. If your Excellency orders a reconstruction, will the villagers dare to object? We are moored in Shanghai and are closely concerned with the pain and suffering of our hometown. If we allow reckless actions, not only will we be ridiculed by the entire nation, but the local people will also be unable to avoid criticism. We earnestly request that you immediately stop it to protect the historical site. Also, we request your decision on whether a rough repair should be carried out before the formal reconstruction. Pinghu Association in Shanghai, Standing Committee Member Ying Yanxing.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Monstrous Birth: A Tumor, Not a Head <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, there was a sudden rumor in Caojiadu Town, Western Shanghai, that a woman surnamed Mou in the Xinchang Workshop had given birth to a two-headed child.</p>
<p>As a result, everyone echoed the rumor, causing a sensation throughout the town. People rushed to see it, all amazed and shocked. However, the family considered it a disgrace and kept the doors tightly closed, preventing outsiders from seeing it. Thus, the rumor spread even more wildly. A reporter heard about it and went to the site around 2:00 PM to investigate. It was at the home of Shen Ruming, No. 48 Xinchang Workshop, behind the Western Post Office at the Triangular Ground in the town. The mother, surnamed Zhu, was Shen's sister-in-law, 24 years old, from Jiangyin. She had arrived in Shanghai from her hometown the day before yesterday and was staying at Shen's place. The woman had been pregnant for twelve months, and her belly was unusually large, which people found strange. The day before yesterday, after arriving in Shanghai, Shen's wife took her to tour the various workshops in the factory for half a day. She went to bed that evening and did not feel any abdominal pain. But after getting up yesterday morning, she suddenly felt excruciating stomach pains and immediately called for a midwife. When the child was born, the midwife was shocked to see something resembling a head hanging between the child's legs. The child had already died. So she put it in a wooden basin and abandoned it outside the door for public viewing. The reporter saw that the child was female, with fully formed limbs and features. Between her legs was a tumor, about the size of a soccer ball, about five or six inches in diameter, attached to the body with a base only an inch or so thick. After someone picked it up, the tumor hung down like a large ball, about twice the size of her head. Bloodstains were visible in the basin. Viewers called it a miracle. In fact, it was not two heads but a monstrous birth. Until evening, people continued to come to see it.</p>

<p>Reason Unknown</p>
<p>Life is in Great Danger</p>
<p>Hu Guofan, claiming to be twenty-eight years old and a native of Shaoxing, wearing a yellow serge jacket and black silk vest, arrived at the New Tibet Hotel, No. 335 Tibet Road, behind the New World, on the 29th of last month. He opened Room 25 on the upper floor of the hotel and paid three yuan. For several days, he behaved normally. Unexpectedly, yesterday at noon, the tea server asked Hu Guofan for the room bill, as it was overdue. Hu replied that he would pay everything off at 6:00 PM. The servants, as he was a regular customer, did not pay much attention. When it was past 6:00 PM, the tea server knocked on the door, as Hu was still asleep. There was no answer. The servants knew something was wrong and forced the door open. They found Hu barely breathing, on the verge of death. They immediately reported it to the Xinzha Police Station, which dispatched Chinese Constable 196 and Western Constable 265 to investigate. They observed that Hu's face was pale and white foam was coming from the corners of his mouth, indicating poisoning. They did not find a suicide note on his person. Later, they found two empty bottles of sedative pills in the drawer of the table. The constables sent Hu to Renji Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, his condition was critical and his life was in danger.</p>

<p>Failed Attempted Abduction of Wang Dabao</p>
<p>Hu Yicheng, a native of Yancheng, living in the Yutong West Thatched Cottage in Zhabei, makes a living pulling a rickshaw. Last spring, through matchmakers Jin Liu and Jin Jiang, he engaged Wang Dabao, a woman of the same origin, as his wife. Hu, having lost both parents and being advanced in years, urgently wanted to start a family. So last winter, he asked the matchmakers to choose a date for the wedding. Unexpectedly, at that time, Dabao's mother suddenly said that her daughter was only sixteen and had not yet developed, so it would have to be postponed for several years. Hu was very angry after learning this, because although Dabao was young, she was tall and robust, looking over twenty years old. So he secretly suspected that there must be a change, but he did not dare to be dogmatic. The day before yesterday, he again asked the original matchmakers to speak, but Dabao's stepfather, Shang San, came out to obstruct, seemingly wanting to break the engagement. Hu was very afraid. Yesterday, he went with the matchmakers and others. When Shang was not home, they carried Dabao out and forced her into a rickshaw, driving away quickly. Unexpectedly, Dabao cried wildly along the way. A police officer on duty, seeing this, was surprised and stopped them, asking for the reason. He arrested Hu and the others and took them to the Fourth District Headquarters. Chief Jin questioned Hu, who said, "In the past, I hired Liu and Jiang as matchmakers to introduce Dabao to me as my wife, and I paid a dowry of 90 yuan. Her mother agreed to it in one go. At that time, her mother was widowed and had not yet cohabited with anyone. She urged me to complete the marriage as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, now she has repeatedly procrastinated, because her lover is instigating from the middle and does not want to live a proper life." The matchmakers also testified that they were indeed the ones who brokered the deal, but they did not know why a dispute had suddenly arisen between the two parties. The judge ordered Dabao's parents to be brought in for further questioning.</p>

<p>What Does He Do in Bed?</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 3:00 AM, there was a sound of fighting and shouting inside No. 51 Hengfeng Road, Zhabei. A police officer on duty at the Fourth District station nearby went to investigate, knocking on the door and entering. He saw two men and one woman wrestling together and immediately arrested them all. According to Gu Bentao, "My wife, Li, is usually well-behaved, and our relationship is strong. Unexpectedly, recently a barber named Gui Wenqing, seeing her beauty, became lustful and made advances to my wife, which she rejected. Tonight, he sneaked into my house, hid in my wife's room, and when she was asleep, jumped into bed and groped her, intending to rape her. Fortunately, I returned home and wanted to take Gui to the police station. Just then, the police officer arrived, please investigate." Li testified, "I am 22 years old. I was just in a dream when suddenly a man came to sleep with me." Gui Wenqing testified, "The day before yesterday, Li asked me to cut her hair and strongly urged me to have an affair with her. Because I could not refuse, I went to meet her tonight. Li did not refuse. Unexpectedly, her husband returned home and falsely accused me of rape."

<p>Zhou Xingbin, owner of Zhou Fuji Foreign Cloth Store at No. 558 Jiujiang Road, received a threatening letter on the 21st of last month, demanding 5,000 yuan. He initially ignored it. Letters continued to arrive, five in total. The last letter, on the 2nd of this month, was extremely harsh, saying that if he did not agree, they would use some means to deal with him, and that the location for negotiation would be notified separately. The next day, Zhou received a phone call from the bandit, instructing him to go to the entrance of the Qianjiang Guild Hall at the corner of Peng Road and North Henan Road at 2:00 PM that afternoon, holding a bundle of newspapers as a sign. Zhou reported it to the Old Gate Police Station, which dispatched Detectives Liu Junqing and Song Bingzheng, and Investigator Pang Yutang, who went to the appointed location that afternoon. At 2:40 PM, Zhang Jinxian from Suzhou was seen loitering there and was captured by the detectives and taken to the police station. He was ordered to write numbers, which were compared with the letters received by Zhou. The handwriting was found to be the same. So yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Special District Court, where Judge Zhou conducted a preliminary hearing and then ordered him to be detained, postponing the investigation of his accomplices.</p>

The former Inspector and Director of the reformatory, Wang Zhaocheng, who had been in office for a year, had put a lot of effort into reorganizing the reformatory and promoting reform and innovation. However, the reformatory lacked funds, making it difficult to work. He applied to the Social Affairs Bureau to resign, which was approved. All the staff of the reformatory, in recognition of Director Wang's efforts to benefit the residents and his hard work, agreed with all the room leaders and police officers to present three silver shields. A farewell meeting was held at 10:00 AM yesterday. Chairman Zhang Xianfang reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by a farewell speech by Director Wang.

<h3 id="e160">Anhui Province Uses Shanghai Rice to Aid Famine Victims <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The rice-producing areas of Anhui Province are now experiencing famine, leading to a shortage of food for the people. Famine victims are rushing to buy rice, and in Anqing, this has led to rice shops closing. The Anhui Provincial Government has decided to implement price controls to help the famine victims, reducing the price of rice by five yuan per shi (unit of measure). It has also issued an order prohibiting rice from leaving the province. However, because there is not much rice stored in Anqing and Wuhu, it is stipulated that each person can only buy five sheng (unit of measure) of rice per day. After famine victims purchase the rice, the police force them to soak it in water before taking it away to prevent unscrupulous people from buying and reselling it. Fearing that there will not be enough rice for everyone, the provincial committee has decided to send a rice purchasing committee led by Jin Teng to Shanghai to purchase 10,000 shi of foreign rice for the implementation of price controls. Yesterday, the provincial government also sent a telegram to China Merchants and Sanbei shipping companies, asking them to transport the rice for free to facilitate famine relief. Yesterday, the shipping companies agreed to reduce the shipping costs of the rice, and the first batch of rice purchased in Shanghai, over 1,000 shi, was shipped yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Xu Peikun's Proposal to Remedy the Low Silver Price and High Gold Price <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Since the international gold price soared, the financial community in our country has been in extreme panic. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce have been trying to remedy the situation, but no effective method has yet been found. Now, economist Xu Peikun has expressed his opinion on the remedy. Mr. Xu is a professor at the School of Commerce of Central University and has a deep understanding of economic issues. We are publishing his opinion below:</p>
<p>In recent times, the sharp drop in silver exchange rates in Shanghai has deeply affected the people of our country, second only to the recurrence of civil war. The sharp drop in silver exchange rates has greatly affected the business community, but ordinary consumers and innocent people have also suffered significant sacrifices. The disaster has spread, and innocent bystanders can hardly escape. Furthermore, China's economic structure will be destroyed as a result. If not, it will only be given a glimmer of hope for recovery, allowing it to linger on. At this critical juncture, domestic bankers, economists, journalists, government officials, and all those who are concerned about current affairs are unanimously investigating the truth of this trend, repeatedly discussing it, and jointly seeking ways to save it. After careful observation of the occurrence of this trend, I have always advocated that the sharp drop in silver exchange rates is half due to the chaos in our country's currency system and half due to the illegal manipulation of the gold exchange (please refer to page 29 of the Commercial Magazine, January 25). Therefore, the way to save it is to prohibit the import of silver and at the same time prohibit speculative trading in gold. On the other hand, the protection of the silver price in our country is actually a necessity. The interests of domestic holders of large amounts of silver and other assets valued in silver cannot be unprotected due to the sharp drop in silver prices. As for the gold standard issue, the author knows that China is not ready to adopt it in the next few years. Even if China has adopted the gold standard system, our country will still have the problem of excessive fluctuations in exchange rates in the next few years, which must be dealt with. At the same time, it is necessary to find ways to maintain the value of large amounts of silver in the country. Therefore, the gold standard policy is not a good way to save the current trend, and besides, the gold standard proposal itself is a problem. Since the author published the above opinion, many economists and bankers have risen up and jointly suggested a ban on the import of silver or other import restrictions. Although there have been criticisms afterwards, they are mostly unsubstantial and have absolutely no reasoned arguments, so there is no need to correct them. In this article, the author will further elaborate on his previous opinions, hoping to dispel biased and unfounded discussions.</p>
<p>(B) Origin of the Misconception Regarding the High Price of Gold and the Low Price of Silver</p>
<p>In this unprecedented dramatic change in China's financial history, many scholars have been confused by it, resulting in confusion and misunderstandings. Some even say that the silver price is a global phenomenon, and the way to save it must be jointly agreed upon by the countries involved to seek a solution. To make their argument more forceful, they cite the law of supply and demand as proof, saying that the production of silver has increased rapidly in recent years, while the demand for silver has decreased significantly because India and Annam have successively adopted the gold standard. Another group argues that the parity of the Shanghai silver exchange rate is often based on the London silver price, and its calculation method is as follows: "Suppose today's London spot silver is one shilling and ten pence, then theoretically the parity of Shanghai is 22X1.175‖25.85d." Therefore, this group says that the Chinese silver price is determined by the London spot silver price, and China cannot control the silver price.</p>
<p>The Impact of Gold Speculation The above statements are nothing more than evasions. According to them, China itself has no way to remedy this trend. If so, what is the difference between resigning to fate? If we think about the above statement a little, we can know that the reason for this error is entirely because they have failed to recognize the real cause of this sharp drop in silver exchange rates, which has led to it. What is surprising is that many scholars have been misled by an erroneous starting point, and then submerged in an empty ideal, and do not know that the key to this problem lies in the expansion and contraction of gold speculation prices. Because of the expansion and contraction of gold speculation prices, the Shanghai silver exchange rate has undergone dramatic changes. In order to understand the truth of this problem, we must first truly recognize that this trend is purely an exchange rate trend, which is closely related to the rise and fall of gold speculation in Shanghai. (1) The Applicability of the Law of Supply and Demand First, we must know that the law of supply and demand cannot be abused. Before citing the law, we must first investigate the nature of a problem and the class system of its applicable principles. From this point of view, we know that the law of supply and demand is not universally applicable. When the demand for something increases, its price does not necessarily increase with it. Sometimes it still remains at the original price or even falls. This is very obvious, because under the condition of mass production, the production cost per unit of goods is often reduced as a result. Conversely, when the demand for something decreases, its price may not decrease with the decrease in demand due to the increase in production costs or the occurrence of other sacrifices. Furthermore, from the supply side, we can also explain that the scarcity of goods cannot immediately increase prices. Because when the price of something is too high, everyone can buy other things to replace it. And those that are scarce may be those that are half unsuitable for the times. Because they are half unsuitable for the times, their selling price can only be low, in order to compensate for part of the loss of effectiveness. Furthermore, when the supply of something is too abundant, its price does not necessarily decrease immediately, because although there are many, it can be reprocessed into other consumer goods, or temporarily stored, to wait for use in different times and places. What is said above is the limitation of the law of supply and demand. Those who talk about principles must not fail to observe, and must not fail to know that what is applied when talking about price fluctuations is a price principle, not just a law of supply and demand.

<p>The Republic of China Fingerprint Academic Research Association declares that Liu Ziwan, President of the Association and Professor at the National Central University, is the most vigorous advocate of scientific governance in our country. In addition to founding the Fingerprint Society in the capital and establishing branches in Shanghai and elsewhere, as well as serving as a professor at the National Central University and being a fingerprint expert in our country, he was recently invited by three universities – Jinan University, Great China University, and Shanghai Law College – to give lectures in Shanghai yesterday. Mr. Liu is currently residing at the Central Grand Hotel and is scheduled to visit Great China University from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM on Tuesday, the Law College from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM on Wednesday morning, and Jinan University from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM on Wednesday afternoon. A grand occasion is expected at that time.</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural and Mining Factory, recognizing that the islands off the coast of Jiangsu Province are the richest fishing grounds in our country, with an area and importance similar to a part of the Caroline Islands in the Pacific, which were entrusted to Japan by the international community after the European War, notes that while Germany and Japan and the international community value them so highly, our country neglects them so much because our people are not fully aware of the situation of these islands. Huadao Island, the gateway to the Yangtze River and the base for central China, was once occupied by the British as a summer resort for British merchants in Shanghai. It was only recovered after negotiations with the Qing government. Recently, to promote the domestic fishing industry and various fishing methods, and for publicity purposes, several films have been made showing the distant views of the islands of Shengshan, Huanglong, Sijiao, Huadao, Lühua, and Bixia outside Songkou, as well as the general situation of old-fashioned fishing and British-style steam trawling. These films were screened at the Wusong Middle School on Taixing Road in Wusong from 7:00 PM yesterday, inviting fishermen to attend and learn from the fishing experience, so that they may know the abundance of aquatic products in our country. Wusong is a gathering place for fishermen and merchants, so screening the films in Wusong is the most effective way to popularize them.</p>
<p>The silk and satin dyeing industry's labor-management joint dye price adjustment committee has been established for more than five months. The internal organization is very strict, and the staff is dedicated to their work. Therefore, although little time has passed, the results have been remarkable. Because the original office space is insufficient, the committee moved to No. 301 Yongping Lane, Guizhou Road, the location of the industry's trade association, on the 5th of this month, and continues to work as usual. To further improve the organization, the committee is undergoing a thorough internal restructuring. Therefore, the dyeing bills for April have not yet been collected from the silk stores. It is said that as soon as the internal restructuring is complete, staff will be dispatched to collect the bills.</p>

He stated that the company had been affected by the gold rush last year, and the price of raw materials such as tobacco leaves and tin foil packaging had increased significantly. Although sales were widespread, there was a slight loss. He hoped that the shareholders would provide suggestions for improvement so that they could be followed and development could be jointly pursued. No one expressed any dissenting opinions. A vote was then held to elect the current board of directors and supervisors. Zhang Songji was appointed as the recorder, Liu Dinghe as the vote counter, Hong Yisheng as the ballot reader, and Zhang Bingyuan as the ballot writer. As a result, Yu Liangui, Chen Enqi, Hong Yisheng, Mi Ziheng, Chen Jiada, Tong Decheng, and Chen Bangda were elected as directors, Chen Chengxu and Chen Kunxian as alternates, and Liu Heshan and Liu Dinghe as elected supervisors, with Yu Banqin and Qian Ruhe as alternates.

<p>The Tianyi Company announces that since its production of "Emperor Qianlong's Tour of Jiangnan" was released, it has moved the whole city, and various theaters are re-showing it. Starting today, the first two episodes will be re-screened at the Central Grand Theatre for three days, from the 9th to the 11th, followed by the re-screening of episodes three and four for three days.

<p>The New Central Theatre announces that the theatre will screen a detective, martial arts, and erotic domestic film starting today, the 6th. This film is the latest production of the Shanghai Film Company and the most recent masterpiece of Yi Dan Du Yu.

The martial arts scenes are full of vigor, and the portrayal of emotions is particularly delicate and profound. Each show will also feature the newsreel "Huang Huiru's Big Belly," which was filmed by the company on location in a Suzhou hospital. It has been showing at the Central Theatre for three days and is very successful at the box office. The audience has praised it highly.</p>

<p>Physician Cheng Hanzhang announces that he has profound knowledge and extensive writings, especially in internal medicine, pediatrics, and gynecology. Recently, he has accepted the invitation of the Sino-Foreign Great Pharmacy Central Branch at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Middle Ningbo Road. In view of the inconvenience of seeking medical treatment in Shanghai at night, he will be available for consultation for two hours every night from 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM to facilitate patients. This is truly a rare opportunity. Yesterday afternoon (the 4th) was the opening day of the Chaozhou Heji Hospital on Luban Road. Representatives from various organizations attended, including the Cantonese Merchants Hospital, the Chamber of Commerce, the Poor Children's Education Institute, the Mingjue Society, and the Star Film Company. The hall was crowded. When the bell rang twice, the meeting was opened, and the ceremony was performed as scheduled. First, Chairman Zheng Zhengqiu reported on the history of the hospital, saying that the Guangji and Hongji Hospitals, which were founded by the Chaozhou people in the past, were merged last year to save expenses and renamed the Chaozhou Hospital. This spring, because the original buildings were dilapidated and the management was not perfect, the hospital was reorganized and moved to its current location. Also, because the word "Chaozhou" might mislead outsiders to believe that it was exclusively for Chaozhou people, it was changed to Heji Hospital to show that it does not discriminate. Next, Dean Guo Bingde reported on the internal organization. Then, representatives from various organizations, including Xu Wansheng, Shen Xiu, Ouyang Bang, Weng Huidong, Guo Shouchun, and Huang Shaoyan, delivered speeches one after another. Mr. Xu said that this morning, the sky was covered with dark clouds and the weather was gloomy, but when the hospital opened, the clouds suddenly cleared and the sun shone brightly, which is a very good sign for the hospital's future. In addition to delivering congratulatory remarks on behalf of the Mingjue Society, Mr. Shen also reported on the clothing, rice, tea, and medicine distribution activities that the Mingjue Society has been organizing over the years. Mr. Ouyang said that the establishment of a hospital is for the purpose of protecting lives, but we must not only protect lives, but also protect the country. The current China, riddled with holes, is like a sick fat man, large but useless. We must heal him. Finally, Zheng Zhengqiu expressed his gratitude to the guests, and a commemorative photo was taken. It was already dusk when the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Medical Master Deng Yuanhe announces that he has been practicing medicine in Shanghai for eleven years and specializes in internal medicine and pediatrics. He has cured many dangerous illnesses. In addition to serving as the director of the Red Swastika Society Hospital every morning, he is still available for consultation at No. 92 Dawangmiao Street, Lujiabang, Nanshi, from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM in the afternoon, and at the North Clinic in Pingle Lane, Xizang Road, from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM in the afternoon. Telephone number is 63628.</p>

<p>Shakespeare's Famous Play "The Merchant of Venice"</p>
<p>The Drama Association's 14th performance is scheduled to be Shakespeare's masterpiece "The Merchant of Venice," and it is already in rehearsal. The details have been reported in various Chinese and foreign newspapers. It is learned that the play requires more than 50 male and female actors. Because many of the association's actors are scattered in various ports and it is not easy to gather them, the actors remaining in Shanghai are insufficient. After careful consideration, the management decided to expand the organization and recruit external talent. Director Ying Yunwei has been working hard on school drama movements in recent years, such as Jiaotong University, Great China University, Shanghai University, Xinhua Art School, and Patriotic Girls' School, and has made considerable achievements. Therefore, Mr. Ying has specially selected dozens of outstanding people to join the cast of "The Merchant of Venice" to strengthen the cast. The personnel selection problem has been solved, and the rehearsal is now mature. It is scheduled to be officially performed at the Central Auditorium on the 17th, 18th, 24th, and 25th of this month.</p>

<p>Initiated by French Intellectuals</p>
<p>Requesting Support from European Countries</p>
<p>Paris News: The Liangyou Association, affiliated with the French Lorry Museum, has now launched a movement to use a "cultural flag" to protect all scientific institutions, art academies, museums, historical monuments, etc. during wartime, so as to prevent them from being destroyed by war. Dr. Kickerford, an international law scholar at the University of Paris, has drafted a treaty on the use of the cultural flag. France is rich in art and antiquities, and public opinion generally supports this plan. It is generally believed that the Louvre Museum in Paris contains thousands of ancient paintings and treasures. If this treaty is concluded, this museum can also be preserved even if Paris falls to the enemy in future wars. Professor Lowry, who initiated the movement, said, "The cornerstone of future culture is based on beauty and knowledge. Therefore, the artistic treasures created by the ancients must be cherished and passed on to future generations. This must be the responsibility of all countries together. In short, cultural products belong to the whole world and are not the private property of any one country." The initiators are currently seeking support for this plan from European countries.</p>
<p>Dutch Female Writer</p>
<p>Ann McGruder's New Book</p>
<p>Woman's Cross Chang</p>
<p>Society is evolving day by day, and the women who are imprisoned in the male-centered social prison are gradually rebelling due to the hints of the times. They want to fight for and enjoy everything that men and women should enjoy, such as love, marriage, freedom, happiness, and sexuality. Therefore, in recent decades, the works of female writers have mostly focused on love and marriage. This is an expression of resistance to the old era and a genuine demand for women to be treated as individuals. In the countries near the Scandinavian Peninsula, the climate is cold, and thoughts tend to be dull. The remaining poison of the old religion makes it even more difficult for women's thoughts to develop. Therefore, in recent decades, only two female writers, Andassi and Ravloqui, have emerged in literature, and only Ellen Key has been able to fight for women's rights. However, in recent years, the neighboring Netherlands has also been stirred by the German women's struggle for suffrage after the war, and rebellious people have emerged among women. Ann McGruder's work is the most profound in clearly writing out her rebellious thoughts as propaganda.</p>
<p>The lady's first work, "The Rebellious Generation" (Th. Rebel Generation), profoundly and objectively writes out the bitterness and concepts of modern people. It is merely a naturalistic description. However, in the past fifteen years, many men, especially women, have found their own forms in her works. After this work, she went through a period of silence until 1925, when she wrote the sequel to this work, "Tantalus," which more profoundly wrote out the sorrow and despair of wives, carving out a mirror for women to reflect themselves. When this work was published in 1925, she immediately received wide praise, especially the description of women's fight to gain civil rights, which gave women great excitement. Now she has written the third sequel. In this "Woman's Crusade" (womensCtusade), Mrs. Pankhurst is her important protagonist, and the entire description focuses on women's political activities and struggles. This work is more powerful and tighter than the previous two episodes in depicting the active struggle of women to fight for freedom, happiness, and political equality. It can represent her recent mature thoughts. This second sequel has not yet been published. Recently, she gave a lecture in Basel and read several tense chapters from it to the audience. Her long trilogy is more meaningful than the historical novels of the Middle Ages by the Norwegian female writer Andassi. Her future is bound to be a race between the goddess of freedom and Ellen Key in the Scandinavian Peninsula. We are looking forward to the arrival of the "Woman's Cross" (Changxi).</p>

<h3 id="e181">Modern Danish Literature <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Jingshen lectures at Fudan University</p>
<p>Tang Zengxie and Chen Xie take notes</p>
<p>My topic was originally "Modern Scandinavian Literature," which includes the writings of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. That scope is relatively large. Now, due to time constraints, I will only talk about Danish literature first. I can continue to talk about the rest when I have the opportunity.</p>
<p>The "Modern Danish Literature" that I am talking about is from 1900 to the present (tgoooydeent). Chinese people have never paid much attention to Danish literature, and it is rarely mentioned. The most familiar are only three people. One is Hans Christian Andersen (HCAnptesen), a world-famous fairy tale writer. Another is Georg Brandes (G. raude, s), a famous critic. In addition, there is also the author of "Two Legs" and "Twelve Sisters," "Ewaed," who has single-volume translations in Chinese. We have translations by Mr. Li Xiaofeng and Mr. Yuan Jiahua. Regarding Danish literature, apart from these three people, others seem to be very unfamiliar. What I want to talk to you about now is 20th-century Danish literature, not 19th-century Danish literature.</p>
<p>Danish literature had great achievements in the 19th century. For example, Brandes not only gave the Danish people great glory, but also had a great influence on Norway, Sweden, and other countries around the world. As for modern Danish literature, it is often the new trend of international thought. It has a very important position in the Scandinavian Peninsula and is a channel for importing new trends.</p>
<p>Danish literature can be divided into three aspects:</p>
<p>(A) Novels</p>
<p>In the field of Danish novels, a large group of people emerged. They are all from Jutland (jutlahd), so they are called the Jutland School (Jutlandess). Their literary movement is called the Jutland Movement (JutandMouement).</p>
<p>Because Jutland is in the north of the world, facing the sea on three sides, the weather is very cold, and the people's occupations are mostly farming and fishing. They are very capable of developing the local nature and describing the local customs in detail, so the atmosphere of Soilofsoil is very strong in their works.</p>
<p>Johannes V. Jensen (I873), born in 1873, his father studied veterinary medicine, his grandfather was a weaver, and his ancestors were farmers. Therefore, Jensen's works and outlook on life cannot escape from objects such as local conditions and nature. In 1896, he wrote a book "The Danes", and in 1898, "EmerElkar". His work was most influenced by Jobannes Ioroensen. After traveling to the Americas between 1904 and 1905, he wrote several novels. He began to accept foreign influences. His works are novel in thought, extremely vivid, and the themes are mostly past and present, and the objects of life and nature. The work is full of humor and sadness. Later, he wrote many books, and his thoughts gradually stabilized. The main element of Jensen's thought is to promote the spirit of his Gothic race. At the same time, he strongly believes in Darwin's theory of evolution in science. Some say that Jensen's theory of evolution is a literary theory of evolution and has no life. Regarding the theory of evolution, he wrote "Evolution and Morality" in 1925 and "Animal Metamorphosis" in 1927. Although the description is inevitably absurd and empty, it can be regarded as his own expression of a "theory of evolution". Jensen wrote "The King's Failure" between 1900 and 1901. The protagonist of the book is the Danish king Clouskian II's political failure. Writing about America has 奥拉D、ork "Madam" "East Wheel" (19041905) has a detective effect. Writing about the Far East has "New Singapore Story" (1907), etc. At this time, there has been great progress in writing scenery. The reason why he wrote novels about England, America and Denmark is because the Gothic race is made up of England, America and Denmark. Jensen's writings are not only famous in Denmark, but also a representative in the Nordic literary world. Most of his novels have more than 100,000 words, and his novels similar to racial epics are the most famous. His six novels (1) "The Lost King" (1919), (2) "Ice Age" (the above two books are translated into English with the combined name "Fire and Ice"), (3) "Guest of the Goddess of Destiny" (1919), "Footsteps of the People of Zulberri" (1922), (5) "Ship" (1912), (6 "Columbus" (1921). His writing is as thoughtful and painstaking as Bazoc, and the time is very slow. The success of a masterpiece is not a matter of one or two years. This epic-like novel can be divided into four periods: (1) the Ice Age, (2) the Racial Migration Era, (3) the Pirate Era, (4) the Discovery of America Era. The Ice Age was during the Racial Migration Era. What he wrote was a myth. In ancient times, there were hail and rain in the sky, and the people on the earth were all killed. At this time, only one person was left. He desperately rushed north, and met a woman on the way. The man was extremely happy. Later, he fell in love with the woman. This is what happened in the first two books. Later, the man was not satisfied with the current environment, so he discovered his new plan and drifted to an island to live, and later gave birth to many descendants of the Danish people, until the era of the discovery of America. His six novels have the same ambition as Turgenev in terms of quantity. Since then, he has also written five "Myths" (1907-1924), Jorgine (1926), (and three collections of poems, "Poetry" (1906), "Four Seasons" (1923) and "Light of the World" (1926), essays include "The New World" (1907), "The Heart of the Northerner" (1912), "The Leader of Our Time" (1915) and other books,</p>
<p>Jakoh Kunhseh (I858-I9I7) is good at writing about local customs and the life of private school teachers in farmers' villages. He is also a soil writer in Denmark. Kunhseh has also expressed his own thoughts on philosophy and religion. He started writing articles very late, about forty years old. In his youth, he worked as a teacher in rural primary schools. The last twenty years of his life were devoted to lectures and writing. His "Philosophy of Life" shows his thoughts. He is also a religious revolutionary. He is dissatisfied with the religion at that time and has the main view of reform. In 1912, he wrote "Terror", and in 1914, he wrote "Courage", which is about the development of Lutheranism. His works are full of humor and ridicule. His works are mostly subjective, and he often uses the characters in the novel to promote his own thoughts. However, his thinking is against the new trend. Danish modern writers are probably the most zealous.</p>

<p>Chapter 38: 19th Century French Prose</p>
<p>Maupassant relied on the economy of language and thought to create his effects. Émile Zola, the most prolific of the naturalists or realists, piled up minute details, relying entirely on weight to achieve his effect. Compared to him, even Balzac seemed concise and thrifty, while Maupassant was nothing more than bones. Zola's novels are grand in their collective power. All of life is gathered within them, to the point that the reader is almost satiated with life itself, wishing there were not so much of it. Zola lacked the finest French charm and elegance, and the French critical world dealt with him with sharp sarcasm. There are no masterpieces or gems in any of Zola's works. However, if we were to select two or three from his countless works, we could mention "Nana," "The Debacle," and "The Earth." These and many others have been translated into English because his strength lies in his content, not in the magic of a particular style. Continued on page 9.</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<h2>Page 25</h2>
<p>Therefore, he loses almost nothing in translation. Zola's critics reproach him for placing too much emphasis on ugliness, strangeness, and obscenity (of which his novels are undeniable proof). However, his view of life is not unhealthy, but rather that of a doctor simply recording the symptoms of pain, or of a social reformer informing us of the world's errors and hoping for its improvement. His initial successful work, "L'Assommoir" (The Dram Shop), is a great sermon against alcohol. There is no doubt about the sincerity of Zola's aims. The nobility of his character was demonstrated by his courageous battle in the Dreyfus Affair, which made him a national hero after his death.</p>
<p>The person who gave the eulogy at Zola's tomb was Anatole France, a figure as different from Zola as two Frenchmen could be. France, Monsieur, used his country's name as his literary name (which was actually) his father's name, a shortened form of François. And no one can have a more transcendent right to this name. He is original, independent, indulging in reverie in the safety of eccentricity, yet his eccentric spirit encompasses the finest elements of French tradition. If we have his books, it seems we can learn from those books his country, his era, and the French language taking its most complete form. What aspect of life has he not touched with sharp, vigorous, and clear skepticism? "L'Île des Pingouins" (Penguin Island) is a satirical history of civilization; Jonathan Swift would have smiled at it, and Voltaire would have paid homage to someone superior to himself. The four novels collected and called "Contemporary History" are realistic, with a glimmer of light. "Le Crime de Sylvestre Bonnard" (The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard) is a romance with tears and smiles. When he encounters great problems, he is as sincere and passionate as his friend Zola, and he carries the burden of erudition that intimidates mere scholars so lightly on his towering shoulders. His ideas are often revolutionary, and his style is pure and simple. He hates deceit and hypocrisy, but his hatred is gentle, ironic, and philosophical, never becoming agitated due to anger. His genius is critical and analytical, and his novels are cleverly used vehicles for conveying his thoughts and opinions.</p>
<p>The nineteenth century was one of the richest periods of French prose. Novels and criticism flourished in both quality and quantity. Even without outstanding giants, modern France would have a great prose literature. In a century crowded with talented figures, it is difficult to say who stands out, and perhaps there is no need to say. This difficulty is particularly confusing when it comes to novels, where subject matter is subservient to public taste and critical judgment fluctuates rapidly. Although this does not need to trouble us.</p>
<p>One genius who has increased in value with time is Henri Beyle, who, as he called himself, was Stendhal. His novels "Le Rouge et le Noir" (The Red and the Black) and "La Chartreuse de Parme" (The Charterhouse of Parma) are remarkable in their analysis of character. These were published in the first half of the same century, but until Stendhal's death, they did not make much of an impression on people. Balzac understood his value, and later French writers recognized his influence, praising his genius. Rémy de Gourmont, the most magnificent of modern critics, regarded him as a touchstone. If we do not like him, then we can say that we do not belong to the "happy few," the chosen ones who understand.</p>
<p>The author who wrote novels for the happy many was Prosper Mérimée. His Corsican story "Colomba" is a complete story with a stinging content, in the same style as Mérimée's other works, written in a classically clear, yet full of poetic colour, style. His "Carmen" has a double claim to immortality, why? Because it is the material for the most immortal of operas, Bizet's libretto.</p>
<p>Alphonse Daudet, who is aptly called the French Dickens, is like the English master in his sorrow and humor, and in his heartfelt sympathy for all kinds of people, especially those ill-treated by life. In this respect, as he closely resembles Dickens, he also closely resembles Victor Hugo. His first novel to make him famous, "Le Petit Chose" (The Little Thing), is full of generosity and gentleness, and is free from objectionable sentimentality, as is true of the subsequent books that made him ever more beloved by the public. The charm of his style (and of his entire human being, more or less) earned the respect of writers such as Zola, Flaubert, and the Goncourts, who held a much more critical and analytical view of life than he did. He belongs to the naturalist school, as well as to the school of mockers and humorists. His "Tartarin de Tarascon" is one of the finest literary farces.</p>
