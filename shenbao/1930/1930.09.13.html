<h3 id="c150">中華遠征足球隊勝棉蘭中華 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>三對二１一個罰球獲勝１</p>
<p>（八月二十八棉蘭通訊）中華遠征足球隊八月二十六日由星洲抵棉蘭預定在棉比賽四次第一次在二十七日對中華足球隊第二次在二十九日對蘇東足球隊第三次在九月一日對荷人聨合隊第四次在九月二日對亞人聨合隊此四隊中論其實力以蘇東聨隊爲最强中華隊爲最弱亞隊亦汪可侮者也以下所紀乃第一次之戰况</p>
<p>遠征與中華之戰爲該隊蒞臨棉蘭首試鋒芒之舉綜觀全局遠征毫不費力已奏凱旋似未獲展長技至於中華之應戰雖不無聲嘶力竭之處而精彩亦每有表現未可渺視也是日結果爲三與二比袁征勝戰續如左</p>
<h3 id="c151">球塲觀衆人山人海 <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>是日比賽遠征隊雖非棋敵手然初次出塲爭觀丰采者亦紛至沓來比賽時間定在五時惟三時起即有人八塲覓座及時間將至球塲四週人山人海門票爲小販　纰繼票價由七方　增至八九方不等急於人塲者亦不得不多費一二方錢矣</p>
<h3 id="c152">（二）領事開球健兒奔逐 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>時間未至遠征隊已出斱練習遇精彩處輙聞掌聲與喝彩四時三刻遠征隊先攝一影繼而中華隊出塲抛角擇場後兩隊合攝一影乃由駐棉中國領事作霖申先生開球一聲角響雙方健兒奔馳追逍開戰以後遠征似不急於進攻僅往還傳遞惟個人技藝處處顯其高妙中華隊則臨深履薄敬謹將事努力奮門之結果且曾數次衝到遠征門前</p>
<h3 id="c153">（三）中華獲球放砲慶祝 <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>五時十五分華前鋒二人一齊衝至門前周賢言見來勢汹湧撲前急救不料衆寡不敵球方救出又爲中華中銘所得斯時周已奔出門外返救不及球遂應脚人綱中華首開紀錄土人放砲慶祝</p>
<h3 id="c154">（四）球怪舉足人人狂呼 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>遠征隊失球毫不介意進攻仍非積極球僅往還傳遽而已至二二五分時中華球曾陷於圍攻戴麟經陳虞添陳光耀皆有猛烈之射擊但中華隊守門員頗能稱職故绵一一救出二十六分時李惠堂與中華後衛兩人爭奪一球李以脚向後挑取得之即就厡地射門人皆不加注意球雖不甚急但偏向球門右方角度極佳守門員猝不及防球遂破門而入人皆昨舌驚其球藝之妙也兩隊分數相等之後遠征表演漸露精彩中華幾有窮於應付之勢遠征頻頻叩門設中華守門稍弱則失球不勝其數矣</p>
<h3 id="c155">五遠射高擊隨心所欲 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>三十五分時李惠堂舉足遠射球急高中球門上方橫本撞下直竄網内守門員無法施救袁征以得一球以二與一之比佔得優勝直至休息時間到來遠征進攻不已此時最有可觀上半場告終遠征以二與一比勝利下半場開始球往還於兩隊之間中華後衛犯規被罰任意球李惠堂主賜球應聲入綱遠征已紀第三功矣自此以後遠征祗演球藝不事進攻故雖衝至中華站前亦不射擊</p>
<h3 id="c156">（六）中華健兒最後奮鬥 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>不料將近守場之際中華健兒反攻甚急六時中華前鋒傳球已過遠征最後防線右翼傳球至中央迫近遠征門前周賢言撲出但孤掌難鳴卒被報復一球下半場遂馬一與一比無勝負全場則爲三比二遠征勝一罰球</p>
<h3 id="c157">（七）綜觀球藝責備賢者 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>以個人球藝方遠征球員無懈可擊惟是日之戰過於　敵以致成績未滿人意不稔遠征者且謂除李惠堂外餘子皆平平而已期論謬然合作功夫之未週各盡所能之未見一班矣或謂中華非遠征敵手故難展所長是或然耶然九月一日之戰敵勢已熾且看遠征成績若何（查一日遠征將出戰荷聨隊並由恭祝荷皇籌備委員會報效銀杯一座以獎勝者云）</p>

<p>當琵琵但妮兒再看伊以前輔助羅克攝製的短篇滑稽片或是羅蘭拉潑拉脫再看伊以前所攝的髭偵探片再敎伊們來看看伊們新宾成功的有聲影片恐怕至少起了些今昔之感吧在伊們這種感想之中包含幾種成分一種是技術的進步一種是方向的變換一種是事業的成功一種是更上進的希望</p>
<p>我們想想吧外國電影片有幾年的歷史了呢在自然的進化和參與分子的努力之中所以有今日的成績者豈是一件容易的事回想到我們中國在這種産業落後的不安定的社會之間一切建設都少有進展而電影事業却依然能在這種環境之下掙扎雖然是比不上美國但這種精神總也値得我們來感想一下子</p>
<p>所以期望着我國電影事業的進步者不應當說外國影片如何如何好而我國影片却如何如何不及代們因爲歴史不及他們長久資本不及他們充足環境不及他們安定觀衆不及他們普遍自然我國影片該落後了但日事實上假如眞能把歷史資本等等來作一個科學上的比較的話恐怕今日的中國影片不見昨比外國影片退眇吧獨怪有一輩人以爲外國影片總是好的而中國影片則不屑一顧此種媚外的心理實足以亡國而有餘我如其把日本人愛護他們本國電影而排斥美國電影的事實來告訴他們時恐怕又不啻寫一葉國恥小史了</p>
<p>最近我看到二張好影片有如明星公司的一浪漫女子一（中國片）和狐狸公司的（蝶酣花醉）（外國片）雖然我不敢來把浪漫女子說比蠂酣花醉好不過事實上宣景琳女士的表演又何嘗一定說不如珍妮蓋諾呢</p>
<p>啊所缺少者中國影片都是默片面外國影片都是有聲而已那麽在這裏我便希望明星公司的那張一歌女紅牡丹一片趕快出映使一般趨時的中國人也來看看完全對白的中國影片而可以明瞭國産電影確也有人在努力而邁步走向成功之路去了</p>

<p>According to a telegram from He Jian of Nanjing on the 11th, the majority of the bandits launched a fierce attack on our positions in the Gui Tang, Wumeiling, and Yangjiashan areas on the evening of the 10th.

<p>Domestically Produced Seasoning</p>
<p>Don't underestimate a mere mouth. If it understands, it is of great importance. If martial law is imposed, only domestic goods are allowed to be imported and foreign goods are not allowed to be imported. The future of Chinese domestic goods is already very promising. Therefore, a mere mouth is like a small customs checkpoint. The small customs checkpoint must first understand what is a domestic product and what is not. You must be able to distinguish and recognize it thoroughly so that you will not be deceived. Everyone has a mouth and a tongue and wants to eat delicious flavors. Chicken soup and meat soup are meaty, not vegetarian. What do you want when you are tired of eating it? Then you think of seasoning. Although seasoning is a minor matter, the annual leakage is more than hundreds of millions. Recently, domestic products have been used to replace them, which is the best opportunity. The so-called domestic products that are extremely famous and purely domestically produced are: (1) Tianchu's Monosodium Glutamate (Buddha Hand Trademark) (2) Tianyi Factory's Weimu (Lotus Trademark) (3) China Chemical Industry Society's Guanyin Powder (Three Star Trademark) (4) Gengtai Factory's Hehe Powder (Hehe Trademark) After the master understands in his mouth, he must also tell your cook and maid to just import these four types. Buying one more share of domestic goods is reducing one more unemployed person. There are merchants in the market who deliberately change their appearance to pretend to be domestic goods. Of course, everyone will not be deceived by this deceptive behavior.</p>

<h3 id="e6">The European League Plan Within the League of Nations <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The most important issue at the current meeting of the League of Nations is the European League Plan. France is doing its best to make this happen, and other countries have no clear and obvious opposition. The original intention of the League of Nations was to prevent the recurrence of war after the European War, so the League of Nations was established to eliminate it. The European League Plan initiated by France is also based on this idea, so in principle, there is no reason to object. However, the positions of various countries are different, and what is beneficial to France may not be harmless to other countries, so there are few who can sincerely support it. Take the United Kingdom as an example, its words are all in favor of the European League Plan, but its unspoken meaning is that if the countries of the League of Nations can do their best to reduce armaments, future wars will be avoided. Therefore, in supporting the European League Plan, it still focuses on reducing armaments, which can be inferred from its words. In short, although the League of Nations and the European League Plan have the same basic purpose, it is difficult to obtain sincere support within the same type of organization. After all, with the European League Plan, the power of the League of Nations will naturally be reduced. Although people in the League of Nations will not oppose it, they will certainly not be willing to do so.</p>

<h3 id="e9">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues a Declaration <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Admonishing Chinese and Foreign Merchants</p>
<p>Do Not Enter Into Contracts with the North</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, fearing that Chinese and foreign people would be lured by the bogus government in Peiping to enter into various contracts, issued a formal declaration on the 12th. The original text is as follows: It has recently been reported that the main participants in the rebellion have exhausted their tricks and have actually established a bogus government in Peiping with Yan Xishan as its leader. This kind of action is actually the last desperate gamble on the part of the rebels in order to seize the power of the National Government for the personal gain of these people. Their failure is inevitable. The Central Army is now concentrated in the areas occupied by the rebellious army, and the final fate of the Peiping bogus government has been determined. However, some people who do not understand the current situation are lured by the rebels and rashly enter into contracts regarding money or any other purpose. Therefore, it is hereby solemnly declared that any individual or business firm or company, regardless of Chinese or foreign nationality, that enters into any contract of any nature with the Peiping bogus government or any rebel is absolutely invalid. The National Government is not bound by any such contract and considers those who enter into such a contract to be aiding this rebellion. Furthermore, the antiquities stored in the Peiping Forbidden City and other places are the property of the Chinese nation, and no one is absolutely allowed to steal, sell, or transfer them to others. If anyone is found to have privately purchased or occupied these antiquities, they will be severely punished. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>The National Government in Nanjing, fearing that Yan, Feng, Wang, and others would form a bogus government in Peiping and enter into loan contracts or secret debt agreements with foreign merchants or financial groups, which the government would find difficult to recognize, specifically instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to draft a stern declaration to solemnly declare to all countries. It is heard that the declaration has been drafted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and submitted to the National Government for review and will be officially released within days.

<p>The problem of the Agricultural and Industrial Bank and the education fund is currently being handled by Wang Xifu, who has stopped borrowing 200,000 yuan. Chang Yaokui and Lü Hanyun agreed to convene a board meeting in one month to decide on the borrowing method. They also said that the Agricultural and Industrial Bank itself is very concerned about maintaining its position. If too much is lent out, it will affect the market and face such problems as the copper coin ticket fund, most of which is from the Agricultural and Industrial Bank. Furthermore, the Hebei Bank also relies on the Agricultural and Industrial Bank to maintain its position. If it were unfortunate, the copper coin ticket and the Hebei Bank would be implicated. Therefore, it is hoped that the education community and the mediators will be considerate. It is found that Li Shizeng invested 1.05 million in the Agricultural and Industrial Bank. Li pledged 660,000 of the Agricultural and Industrial Bank's shares with the Four Banks, retaining only 390,000 shares. Furthermore, it seems that this stock is not a Gengzi Indemnity fund. When the investment was made, it was done with funds from the World Society. After the shares were purchased, they were pledged to the Four Banks and then another batch was purchased. In reality, this is how it is. Currently, the bank is operating as usual. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Adopts German and Dutch Proposals, Representatives of Various Countries Express Opinions on the European Federation Plan, Siamese Prince Is Elected Chairman of the Committee</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 12th: The League of Nations Adopted Two Proposals at Its Meeting This Morning. One Was the German Proposal to Submit the Issue of Small and Weak Nations to a Committee for Consideration, and the Other Was the Dutch Proposal to Also Submit the Issue of Military Reduction to a Committee for Research. After the Passage of These Two Proposals, the Assembly Immediately Commenced</p>
<p>General Debate. The Theory Presented by Dutch Foreign Minister Blokland Attracted the Attention of the Assembly. He Said That Recently, in European Politics, Realities and Theories Are Greatly Divergent. The So-Called National Self-Preservation Theory Is Really Abhorrent. The Tariff Holiday Conference, After Careful Arrangements, Ended Up Failing, Also Thanks to This Selfish and Self-Interested Doctrine. According to French Speculation, French Foreign Minister Briand Is About to Engage in a Fierce Debate with British Foreign Secretary Henderson. This Debate Will Be Held at a Meeting of the Sixth Committee of the General Assembly, Because the European Federation Plan Advocated by the French Will Be Submitted to the Committee for Consideration. Also, News: The Governments of All British Territories Have Agreed to Support Ireland's Request for a Seat on the League of Nations Council to Fill the Vacancy of Canada.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 11th: Siamese Chief Representative Prince Fanvandia Was Elected Chairman of the League of Nations Council Agenda Committee and Chairman of the General Affairs Committee of the Assembly Today.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th: French Foreign Minister Briand Said at the League of Nations Council Meeting in Geneva Today About His European Federation Plan That All Countries Answering This Question Agreed on the Principle of a United Europe. It Is Clearly Visible That Countries Most Affected by the European War Should Unite to Prevent Future Wars. There Is No Conclusion Yet, But Closer Unity Is Indeed Necessary. There Are Still Many Obstacles to the Reduction of Armaments, But Many Have Been Overcome. As Far as France Is Concerned, France Has Now Reduced Armaments, But If the League of Nations Has Not Paved the Way to Safety, How Can France Be So? The Work of the London Conference Is Well Known. He Has Close Diplomatic Relations with Friendly Neighbors. He Hopes That Mr. Henderson Will Claim That the Closest Cooperation Between European Governments Is Crucial to European Peace. The British Government Has Stated Its Intent in Its Reply to the European Federation Plan and Has Expressed Great册 情For This Proposal. No Matter What Developments After This Plan Is Submitted for Discussion, the British Government Always Hopes to Implement It Together with the League of Nations and Not Conflict with the International Obligations of Member States of the League of Nations, and Hopes That It Can Help the League of Nations' Disarmament Policy. The British Foreign Secretary Also Said That the British Government Greatly Agrees With the Majority Report of the Committee on Reorganizing the League of Nations Secretariat and Hopes That This Report Can Be Passed Unanimously. The Treaties Established Under the Guidance of the League of Nations Should Be Approved As Soon as Possible. He Hopes That the Optional Clauses in the World Court Statute Can Be Accepted by All Countries Next Year, Because This Is the First Step in Resolving All Problems Through Peaceful Means. He Also Hopes That the Amendments to the League of Nations Charter Can Also Be Approved This Year So That They Are Consistent With the Peace Pact. Of All Safety Plans, Disarmament Is the Most Important. He Hopes That There Will Be Continued Progress in This Area. One of the Main Tasks of the British Imperial Conference Is to Consider the British Empire's Continued Contributions to Disarmament. The British Government Believes That the Financial Aid Agreement Is an Important Plan to Prevent the Occurrence of War. He Hopes That This Agreement Can Be Concretely Drafted. The United Kingdom Is Willing to Accept It Under One Condition, Which Is That the Full Convention on the Reduction and Limitation of National Armaments Must Be Thoroughly Implemented. Now the People of the World Are Gradually Becoming Impatient and Doubting the Integrity of Their Governments. Although Real Progress Has Been Achieved, Such as the London Naval Treaty, It Is Only the First Step. The British Government Is Prepared to Move Forward Again. If the London Naval Treaty Cannot Be Universal and Cannot Be Applied to Land and Air Armaments, Then the Peace of Europe and the World Cannot Be Guaranteed.</p>
<p>The British Government Hopes That the Disarmament Preparatory Committee Can Complete Its Work in November This Year So That the League of Nations Administrative Council Can Convene the World Disarmament Conference Next Year.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Paris, 12th: French Foreign Minister Briand's Remarks in Geneva on Adopting the Pan-European Federation Plan Have Aroused Enthusiastic Discussion in Various Daily Newspapers Today. La Martinique Newspaper Claimed That Although Mr. Bai Has Made Every Effort to Advocate This Plan, He Does Not Claim to Be the First Person to Advocate This Doctrine. The Nouveau Newspaper Reported That This Act Will Be the Prelude to European Unity. There Are Only Two Newspapers Opposing Mr. Bai's Remarks. One Is the Figaro Newspaper, Which Titled Its Article "The Loss of Pan-Europe," and the Paris Herald Said That Mr. Bai Should State That His Defense Is Based on Personal Claims and Personal Responsibility Because His Opinions Cannot Be Agreed to by Members of the French Cabinet. Mr. Henderson's Remarks Were Greatly Criticized. The Newspaper's Comments Show That France Will Reject Purely Idealistic Remarks. It Is Impossible to Thoroughly Disarm. The La Bernale Newspaper Claimed That the British Foreign Secretary's Remarks Were Born Out of the German Theory of Disarmament. It Is Extremely Difficult for France to Accept What He Said That All Countries Have Actually Recognized the Responsibility to Establish a Comprehensive Disarmament Treaty in Accordance with the Treaty of Versailles, Which Is Also Something That France Cannot Recognize.</p>

It Provided a Substantial Presentation of Certain Review Materials Hoped for By the Privy Council in an Informal Form, Eliminating the Privy Council's Doubts. Therefore, Although the Treaty Has Now Been Passed, the Problems With the Treaty Signing Procedures, Namely the Issue of Command,</p>

<h3 id="e63">He Yingqin Arrives in Hunan to Plan the Suppression of Bandits <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence After the Communist Bandits Zhu Mao, Peng Huang, Lin Kong, and Li and Others Jointly Attacked Changsha and Failed, They Are Now on the Left Wing, Retreating to the Yong'an City and Gaoqiao Area 50 to 60 Miles From Changsha. On the Right Wing, They Are Retreating to the Yijiawan, Zhaoshan, and Pujishi Areas 50 to 60 Miles From Changsha. On One Hand, They Are Building Projects in an Attempt to Resist Stubbornly. On the Other Hand, They Are Dispatching Bandit Teams in an Attempt to Steal Across the Xiang River From the Yijiawan Tantangzi Area to Copy Changsha. Therefore, Although the Siege of Changsha Has Been Lifted, It Is Still in a Large Encirclement By Bandits, But the Distance Is Slightly Farther. Because the Fourth Route Army Is Constantly Guarding Against Bandit Raids, It Dare Not Pursue Them. Ordinary Hunan People Believe That the Bandit Forces Are Still Strong and the Provincial Capital Is Still Not Safe, So They Are Heading to Hankou One After Another to Ask He Yingqin to Provide Assistance and Request That He Personally Lead Elite Troops and Planes Into Hunan to Severely Suppress Them. In Order to Understand the Bandit Situation and Comfort the People of Hunan, He Took the Caisse Airplane From Hankou at 7 AM on the 9th, Accompanied Only By Qian Dajun, Commander of the Third Training Division. He Jian Received the News and Immediately Sent the Tuofeng Steamer to the Xinhe Airport to Greet Him. On One Hand, He Notified Various Agencies and Groups to Send Personnel to Welcome Him. At 9:30 AM, the Plane Arrived at the Airport. He Jian and Other Military and Political Officials and Leaders of Various Groups Welcomed Him in the Area. Hundreds of People Were in the Area. For a Time, the Military Music Was Uplifting and the Cheers Were Thundering. After He Yingqin and Dajun Got Off the Plane and Socialized With the Welcoming People, They Took a Steamer With He Jian and Others to the Fuxingmen River Bank and Changed to a Car to the General Headquarters (Resting and Having Lunch in the YMCA). At 12:00 Noon, They Went to the Front-Line Positions to Inspect Them, Taking Three Planes at the Same Time. He Yingqin and Qian Jun Took One Plane Together, He Jian and Chief of Staff Liu Yinggu Took One Plane Together, and Civil Affairs Director Cao Bowen</p>
<p>Finance Director Zhang Kailian Also Took One Plane Together, Flying to the Yijiawan, Zhaoshan, Tantangzi, Pujishi, Tongbingpu, Datopu, Tiaomajian, Yong'an City, Dongshan, Chunhua Mountain, Xianiangang, Gaoqiao, and Langlishi Areas Where the Communist Bandits Fled and Circulated for Several Weeks Before Returning to the Province at 2 PM. They Immediately Convened a Military Meeting at the General Headquarters. All Regiment Leaders and Above in the Province Attended the Meeting and Sat in on the Meeting. After the Plan for the Encirclement and Suppression Was Agreed Upon, He Had Another Secret Talk With He Jian Once. It Was Already 4 PM. He Yingqin Said Goodbye to He Jian With Qian Dajun and Took a Car to the Fuxingmen River Dry Port and Changed to a Steamer to the Xinhe Airport. He Took the Original Plane, the Caisse, and Flew Around the Sky Over Changsha for a Week Before Heading Back to Hankou (September 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e64">He Jian Writes a Letter Describing the Bandit Suppression Process <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>To the Hunan Rehabilitation Committee, Letter Dated September 9th, Changsha Correspondence This Year Has Been Eventful in the Seven Lakes of Sanxiang. The Changsha Provincial Capital Fell to the Gui Army on June 3rd, and Again to the Communist Bandits on July 27th. The Loss of Life and Property of the People Cannot Be Counted. In Addition, in Late August, He Jian Adopted the Plan of Inducing the Bandits to Go Deep Due to the Tragic Defeat of Dai Douyuan's Brigade in Wenjiashi. The Entire Army Withdrew to Changsha and Built Trenches in the Suburbs to Fight. The People Were Frightened and Scattered East and West. From August 31st to September 4th, After Five Days and Nights of Fierce Fighting, Although the Bandits Were Repelled, They Were Repeatedly in Danger. It Was Very Fortunate That Changsha Was Not Captured Twice. Now, Although the Bandits Have Temporarily Retreated, They Are Still Plotting to Counterattack. He Jian's Troops Dare Not Pursue Them Deeply, So Changsha Has Not Yet Entered a Safe Area. Gui Department Tang Shengming and Others Took the Opportunity to Attack Hengbao Again. The Panic Has Not Subsided, and the People Suffered Even More Disaster.</p>
<p>Hunan People Inside and Outside the Province Were So Angry That They Resented He Jian's Inappropriate Measures on a Daily Basis. Therefore, They Accumulated Resentment Against He Jian. Not Only Did They Frequently Criticize Him in the Beijing-Hankou Area, But the Hunan Rehabilitation Committee Also Submitted a Request to the Central Government to Reorganize the Hunan Provincial Party Department and Provincial Government to Extend Disciplinary Measures. It Can Also Be Seen That the Air Inside and Outside the Province Is Evil to He Jian. He Jian Especially Explained the Situation of the Bandit Suppression Yesterday and Deeply Blamed Himself to the Hunan Rehabilitation Committee. The Original Letter Is as Follows: Qi Zhe, the Communist Bandits Zhu Mao, Peng Huang, and Others Received the Mission of the Third Country and Gathered 40,000 to 50,000 Bandit Troops, Spears, and Spears From Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Provinces, and 50,000 to 60,000 Red Guards in an Attempt to Capture Changsha to Spy on Wuhan. My Department Felt That It Was Difficult to Achieve Quick Results in the Investigation and Suppression Due to the Loss of Dai (Douyuan)'s Brigade in Wenjiashi and the Widespread Bandit Transformation Area in Pingliu. Moreover, the Provincial Capital Is Important and Rumors Are Frequent. It Is Better to Shorten the Battle Line and Induce the Bandits to Go Deep to Annihilate Them. This Can Calm People's Hearts and Benefit the Military Opportunity. Therefore, in Late August, All Departments Were Withdrawn to the Suburbs to Firmly Build Projects, and Water and Land</p>
<p>The Key Areas Are Strictly Guarded. The Bandits Arrived in the Suburbs in Order From the 28th and 29th and Immediately Contacted and Smashed Our Positions Dozens of Times. After Six Days and Nights of Bloody Battles, Thanks to the Assistance of Friendly Forces and the Efforts of the Soldiers, 5000 to 6000 Communist Bandits Were Killed and Wounded, and Many Guns Were Seized. It Is Reported That Zhu De and Li Shixing Were Killed in Action, and Bandit Peng Was Injured. The Bandits Suffered Heavy Losses and the Entire Front Shook. Therefore, They Began to Flee on the 4th of This Month. According to Reports, Bandit Leaders Peng Huang and Others Discussed and Trained the Bandit Army That They Must Succeed in the Communist Revolution in China if They Capture Changsha. If They Fail, They Will Still Hide in the Luzhiling, Taipingpu, Tiaomajian, Tianjiling Area and Try to Induce Our Entire Army to Attack and Seize Changsha. Our Army's Attack Troops Secretly Re-Entered the Positions. On the Night of the 5th, The Bandits Really Attacked Our Positions in the Guitang Area. After a Painful Attack, The Bandit Forces Were Unable to Support Themselves. Now, The Major Communist Bandits Have Split Up and Fled to the Yijiawan, Tiaomajian, Zhentoushi, Luzhiling, Jiegui Ridge, Yong'an City, and Chunhua Mountain Areas. The Troops Have Been Ordered to Search Painfully, Step By Step</p>
<p>Wipe Them Out. However, On This Day of Suppressing Bandits and Saving Hunan, It Is Appropriate for All People to Unite. However, Tang Rebel Shengming and Others Corresponded With the Communist Bandits From Afar and Led Their Remnants to Attack Southern Hunan Again. Xinwu, Dongling, Qining and Other Counties Were Captured One After Another. Recently, They Have Been Forced to Approach Hengzhou, Trampling On the Ancestors'</p>
<p>Graves and Plunging the People Into Deep Water and Hot Fire. It Can Be Said That They Are Losing Their Minds and Are Public Enemies of the People of Hunan. The Hengbao Garrison Troops and Teams Have Been Ordered to Strictly Block Them, and Troops Will Be Added to Suppress the Bandit Communist Rebels After They Are Largely Resolved. Your Association Is Concerned About the Scars and Is Planning the Rehabilitation. The Military Affairs Have Been Given Great Support. I Am Deeply Grateful. I Will Briefly Describe the Recent Situation of the Bandit Suppression to Release the Taiwan Note. The Fellow Villagers Outside the Province Are Not Clear About the Hardships. The Accusations Are Also Separate With the Intention of Fuelling the Flames. Jian Is Ashamed of His Poor Coordination, Which Has Resulted in the Two Falls of Xiangcheng. Every Time I Think of the Disaster, I Feel Deeply Sorry. I Can Only Supervise My Subordinates to Do Their Best to Eliminate the Bandit Communist Rebels and Suijing Township to Make Up For the Previous Sins and Comfort the Hopes of the People of the Country. All the Experiences Are Truly Given to Public Opinion. Correspondingly, I Ask You to Check and Refer to Them As</p>

(Education Director He Siyuan remained in office.) The Standing Committee of the Provincial Government was held earlier on the morning of the 8th, Tuesday, the 9th. After the meeting, the Provincial Government announced the end of its work and stopped working from the 9th. Each department handover was also assigned responsible personnel. The Civil Affairs Department was handled by Secretary-General Ning Kun. The Finance Department was handled by the Section Chief of the Second Section, Zhu Wenquan. The Provincial Government Secretariat was handled by the Section Chief of the Second Section, Ye Jialong. The committee members originally planned to leave for the south today (the 9th). However, Chen Diaoyuan sent a telegram urging and dispatched a special car to welcome them. Therefore, the time was temporarily advanced. At 9:30 last night (the 8th), the luggage was transported to the car. At 9:50, the four committee members, Yuan Chen Yu Chen, together with the Provincial Government Secretary Gong Zhangfu, Gong Qiushuang, the Civil Affairs Bureau Secretary Xie Lian, the Construction Department Secretary Kou Lizhun, the Finance Department Accounting Director Ye Lianfu, the General Affairs Director Shu Qiao, and others, took a car to the Jiaoji Station and boarded the train at 10 o'clock, passing Jinpu South. It is reported that the committee members' special train went directly to Xuzhou and then to Liuhe to contact Chen Diaoyuan and Zhu Xi. The next step is to go to Beijing to receive the appointment letter and go to Anqing to take office. After the old provincial committee members went south, Han Fuqu sent people to take over in advance on the 9th, and immediately took office. When the central oath supervisor Song Ziwen arrives in Jinan, the oath ceremony will be held again. (September 9th)</p>

<p>The Calamity of the Taian Military Disaster. The reporters arrived in Taian at 4 pm on the 1st and immediately went to the headquarters of the 15th Route Army to visit. It happened that Commander-in-Chief Ma Hongkui had gone to Jinan to report and had not returned, so he was received by Chief of Staff Luo Zhen. According to Luo, the Central Army captured Taian Station on the 5th. The enemy entered the city on the 6th to resist. Cai Yan'kai's division besieged the city on the 8th.</p>
<p>The army took over the siege on the 9th and twice threw letters to Huang Shitong, the brigade commander of the 12th Brigade of the Jin Army defending the city, urging him to surrender. Huang initially did not answer, but the second time Huang replied in a letter, roughly saying that he could not have both integrity and life, and he would rather sacrifice his life to defend the city. Therefore, the army had no choice but to bomb the city, etc. On the morning of the 2nd, the reporters entered the city and visited the headquarters of the 64th Division to visit Division Commander Ma Tengjiao. According to Ma, the division captured Ningyang on the 4th, passed Wenkou on the 6th, and arrived here on the 8th to take over the siege. When Commander-in-Chief Liu lived in Honggou, he ordered the city to be attacked. Tai City was built of stone and could not be opened urgently. Commander-in-Chief Liu personally went to Tai Station and climbed Haoli Mountain to command, but it was also ineffective. I inspected the city around the foot of Mount Tai on the 11th</p>
<p>So I decided to dig a tunnel. At the southwest gate, I started digging during the daytime gunfire. On the 22nd, 400 pounds of explosives were transported. Because the amount was small, it was completely installed in the tunnel at the west gate. On the 23rd, another 400 pounds were transported from Jinan and also installed in the tunnel at the west gate. On the 24th, the bricks and stones were bombed two or three hundred meters at dawn. The residents outside the city had been secretly ordered to move the day before, so no people died. The division took the opportunity to attack and fought in the alleys for two hours before disarming the remnants of the enemy in the north of the city, the Dai Temple, and the southeast and southwest gates. My brigade commander</p>
<p>Ma Quanliang was injured in the leg when he captured Huang Tuling and is still receiving medical treatment in Jinan. Then I went to inspect the city. Outside the west gate, the outer city was bombed to the root, and rubble was piled up. The tunnel was about seven feet deep and four feet long. It was completed from the 19th to the 23rd. From the city</p>
<p>Outside the Taiji Stone Printing Bureau, it leads to the Chinese and Western pharmacies inside the city. Among the destroyed houses, there are seven or eight houses including the mainland bookstore and the Chengwen Bookstore, twelve rooms of the Daosheng Tea Shop, five Chinese and Western pharmacies,</p>
<p>Five Taiji Stone Printing Bureaus, five Taihe Foreign Goods Stores, and</p>
<p>Six Zheng's Ironware Stores, a total of more than 60 rooms, all became powder. The Dai Temple in the northeast corner of the city was also hit by many shells. The west mountain corner of the Junji Hall has been bombed down. When the Jin army defended the city, the people were afraid of planes and bombs and mostly hid outside the Dai Temple. The Shanmen is a door that is slightly like a city wall. The people dug holes in the door wall to live in, and then they were driven away by the Jin army and moved to the cave, so there were many surrenders in the Dai Temple when the city was broken. Huang Shitong, the brigade commander of the Jin army, initially fed the residents, and then moved to the Tiantai Yinhang. All circles once asked Huang not to hold on to the city store to the death, but Huang falsely refused. When Brigade Commander Ma Quanliang entered the city, he did not know where Huang was, so he tore off his armband and pretended to be a Jin army, shouting that the enemy had entered the city and that the brothers should protect the brigade commander. Someone responded and said that the brigade commander was in the Dai Temple, so go protect him quickly. Ma ran to the Dai Temple and shouted, "Where is the brigade commander? Let's protect him!"</p>
<p>Huang's guards replied, "The brigade commander is here." Ma immediately jumped forward and captured Huang, but was injured in the leg by Huang's guards. The city was fought in separate alleys, so the civilian houses were either broken into</p>
<p>Holes or completely collapsed, and there was no time to see them. According to the latest survey by the Public Security Bureau, 44 people died and 68 were injured in the city, and 1,513 houses were damaged, worth about 63,230 yuan. The losses outside the city are still being investigated. It is indeed a great catastrophe that Taicheng has never had before. At 12:00 noon, I climbed Mount Tai and inspected along the way, passing through Yitiandoumugong Hutian Pavilion Yueling to Zhongtianmen. There is a</p>
<p>Cai Tingkai's division dug a trench that extends east to Zhongqi Mountain in the west to Baiyangfangding, which is very long. Going up to Nantianmen again,</p>
<p>It is especially dangerous. There is a battle trench of the Jin army in the center of Nantianmen, with machine gun positions set up on both sides, extending along the peaks. The houses in Zhongtianmen and Nantianmen were damaged. According to the scholars on the mountain, Liu Zhaotang, the brigade commander of the 21st Brigade of the 15th Army of the Jin Army, retreated from the foot of the mountain on the 15th. Cai Tingcuo returned and pursued from behind. Liu Brigade defended Nantianmen, waiting for reinforcements. Coupled with the continuous heavy rain, he could not retreat from behind the mountain, so he had to try his best to defend. The vanguard of Cai's division attacked the Shouxing Pavilion under Nantianmen, but the rear team did not arrive, so they retreated to Zhongtianmen and blocked the road. The next day, Cai's division exchanged defenses with Ma's division. At this time, the Jin army attacked from Laolongzhai, took Zhongqi Mountain, and took Baiyangding from Lanzhu Mountain, and forced down from the stone steps of Nantianmen in the middle. Ma's division retreated to Yemaling and immediately counterattacked.</p>
<p>The attack continued to Zhongtianmen, and the fierce battles on the 18th and 19th were the most intense. There were three trips between Zhongnan and Nantianmen in one day. Afterwards, Ma's division went around Heilongtan from Diumugong and copied to Yuhuangding to intercept the rear of the Jin army at Nantianmen. The Jin army could not support it and retreated in chaos from behind the mountain. Several Jin army corpses were buried under Daibusong above Hongqiaofeipu (the mountain chair is the sedan chair that goes up the mountain). The people who passed there still pointed and told each other. However, before the Jin army retreated, Liu Zhaotang abandoned his</p>
<p>The ministry secretly ordered the Taoist priests to lead the way from the back mountain, so he was spared being captured. That night, the reporters stayed at Yuhuangding. They went down the mountain at 2:00 pm on the third morning and boarded the train north again. According to this observation, Taian suffered a great disaster. The number of manual carts heard about requisitioned was as many as 3,000.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Current Situation in Jining Port. The reporter group left Tai at noon on the 3rd and headed north. South of Jieshou, they saw another trench of the Jin army. North of Taian, a bridge was destroyed. There was an anti-aircraft gun position at Wandezhan. After passing this, they did not see any traces of war. After the Jin army was defeated in Taian, they retreated to the north bank of the river. When they first retreated to the north bank, they only left a few troops in the north of Luokou. Recently, they have increased their troops again. Since the 1st, they have been fighting with the Central Army across the river. The Central Army's Li Yunheng Division is guarding west of Luokou, and the First Army Group is guarding east of Luokou. The defense is very solid. The Jin army is not formally counterattacking, but is actually coordinating with the Feng army on the Longhai Line, etc. Then I visited Acting Chairman Yuan Jiapu at the Provincial Government. According to the conversation,</p>
<p>The difficulties of the provincial government are extremely extreme. After the military affairs, the magistrates of the counties are all appointed by the various armies for convenience. The tax money is intercepted by each and sent to the headquarters, so the provincial government can hardly take measures for the county administration of the outer counties. Jinan was not disturbed when the Jin army retreated, etc. Although the local order in Jinan can be heard from Luokou at that time, the artillery fire is still quiet. The reporter group rested for a day on the 6th and decided to return to Xuzhou on a one-time train on the evening of the 7th (6th).</p>
<h3 id="e69">Guangdong Merchants Request Improvement of Stamp Duty Regulations <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The General Chamber of Commerce Will Organize a Discussion Meeting. The City Chamber of Commerce Proposes Improvement Proposals. Guangzhou Correspondence: The Provisional Regulations on Stamp Duty Law in Guangdong were promulgated on January 1, 1926. At that time, it was only an expedient measure to raise money, so there was the word "provisional." Since then, it has been used as an example and implemented to this day without being revoked. Moreover, the stamp duty law differs from the stamp duty law promulgated by the central government.</p>
<p>It is very necessary to abolish the provisional regulations promulgated in Guangdong. Not only has it not been abolished, but in recent years, abuses have grown. The Guangzhou General Chamber of Commerce convened a special meeting of merchants on the 6th to</p>
<p>Discuss the issue of the survival of this provisional ordinance. More than forty representatives of various industries attended the meeting that day. At 1:30 pm, the</p>
<p>Meeting was held, and Huang Yong was elected as the interim chairman to announce the origin of the provisional stamp</p>
<p>Regulations and the abuses that have occurred in recent days. Please have each representative express as many opinions as possible so that a memorial can be drafted and submitted to the Finance Bureau for review. Chen read out proposals from the Silver Industry, the Rice and Sugar Association, and the Rice Merchants Association, emphasizing that the provisional regulations have been</p>
<p>For years, it has been harsh on the business community, and special requests have been made for improvement or revocation to alleviate the suffering of the merchants. Synthesizing all opinions, Group A advocated submitting a request to the Finance Bureau to amend the regulations. Group</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Group B advocated submitting a request to revoke the regulations fundamentally. As a result of the vote, the Guangdong Stamp Duty Provisional Regulations Discussion Committee was organized, and Peng Chuli and other fifteen business directors were immediately elected as drafting</p>
<p>The members and requested the government to send personnel to participate. The draft was completed within a week. The Guangzhou City Chamber of Commerce also formulated proposals to improve the stamp duty law due to the current stamp duty law's harshness and illness to the people.</p>
<p>A proposal to be submitted to the National Industry and Commerce Conference. The original text is as follows: I think that stamp duty is a national tax revenue. If it is handled properly, merchants should sincerely obey it. However, those who carry out inspections are not for promotion but for fines. Whenever they arrive at a store, they are aggressive and</p>
<p>Wolves and tigers watch for flaws and pick bones in eggs. They only know how to use their emotions and do not base fines on laws and regulations, enriching themselves without regard for the</p>
<p>People's pain. If this is the case, then the incompetence of the inspectors is indeed a serious problem.</p>
<p>Seeing this, our association proposed several matters to be improved. If they can be put into practice, it may not be a blessing to the people. (1) Inspectors should wear uniforms and badges to show their marks and show seriousness. At the beginning of the implementation of the stamp law, the original rules stipulated that all inspectors should wear uniforms and badges on their chests, but they were soon</p>
<p>Time and abandoned without use. It is appropriate to restore the old system to prevent abuse and avoid harassment. This should be improved</p>
<p>One (2) Judgment should be allowed to be viewed by the people so as not to be at a loss</p>
<p>Comply. It is found that each branch only issues a ticket notice when executing fines for stamps, and does not state the reasons for the case. When inquiring in the district, they are not allowed to do so. It is appropriate to make a judgment based on the original rules and allow the people to come to the district to view</p>
<p>Those who do not agree may appeal within three days to avoid injustice</p>
<p>Depressed and subsidized compliance. This should be improved. Two (3) Light penalties should be imposed for missed signatures on stamps. Merchants who affix stamps have complied with the rules. If they miss a signature, it is understandable. If they prevent flipping</p>
<p>Affixing, then the penalty for flipping affixing is very severe and can be punished according to the law. It is appropriate to impose light penalties to show leniency and show submission. This should be improved. Three (4) Strictly prohibit the sealing of safes. The stamp duty regulations stipulate that without special orders, one may not tilt boxes, pour baskets, or seal safes. However, recently, when inspectors go to stores for inspection,</p>
<p>If the owner or colleagues are out and the safe cannot be opened without a key,</p>
<p>A sudden seal is added, resulting in all kinds of stagnation and inconvenience. This should be improved. Four. The above four points are hereby proposed for improvement to prevent harshness and show compassion. Whether it is appropriate, please decide publicly (September 8th).</p>

<p>Discovery and Arrest in an Extortion Case: This newspaper previously reported a case of a con man, using the alias of a stationed soldier named Sheng Bingdun, defrauding monks and nuns of various monasteries. It is now known that the County Public Security Bureau has dispatched Zhang Yiqian from the Third Section to investigate Dongwai. It was found that on the afternoon of the 9th, at 1:00 PM, a man claiming to be Chen Chao, an officer of the Public Security Bureau, accompanied by two others dressed in military uniforms claiming to be adjutants, went to Dongchan Temple, stating that troops would be stationed there. To avoid this, the temple would have to pay ten dollars. Yueqing, a monk at the temple, suspected them and reported to the Fourth Sub-Station, who sent police to investigate. Chen Chao then left with the adjutants in military uniform. Furthermore, it was learned that the so-called Chen Chao went to Dizang Convent that same afternoon, using the same threat of stationed troops. Fuming, a nun at the convent, pleaded repeatedly and paid two dollars, with a surname Zhu pilgrim added two dollars, before they left. Wu Juchi, the Dongwai Town Mayor, provided written proof of these events and reported them to the bureau. Director Zhu of the bureau, after confirming the facts, immediately dispatched an inspector, Si Wu Zhaoying, to the Xin Song Min Bao newspaper office to arrest the suspect. However, the staff there claimed that Chen had not been to the office for three days and did not know his address. Therefore, the arrest could not be made, and the matter was reported to the director for further action.</p>

The boy was physically weak and died on the 3rd of this month. Liu Cha entrusted a scavenger to dispose of the body at the entrance of Caishen Alley, Jingde Road. The local security officer discovered it and reported to the local court for examination. The body was unidentified, so the Tuiren Charity Hall collected and buried it in the Yizhong Cemetery in Sanliowan outside the gate. The other day, the court prosecutor's office suddenly received a secret letter reporting that the child had died as a result of abuse by Liu Cha. Prosecutor Lu Yi Hou brought Deng Jinsheng, Shi Qi, and Liu Cha to the court for investigation. Liu Cha vehemently denied abusing or beating the child to death. Prosecutor Lu then ordered police officer Cheng Junzhi to take Liu Cha and the others to the Yizhong Cemetery at approximately 8:00 AM yesterday (the 13th) to open the coffin and identify the body. However, upon opening the coffin, the body had completely decomposed, making it impossible to prove anything.

<p>Recently, Suzhou has been searching for communists, and many people in the education sector have been arrested. The County Rectification Committee telegraphed the province, requesting that officials be sent to Suzhou to assist in the investigation. Yesterday (the 12th), Tai Xun issued an order stating that the officials planned to offer the following advice: (1) The county party headquarters should inform the principals of each school to closely monitor the actions of students and faculty, as well as any incoming printed materials. If any suspicious circumstances are discovered, they should take appropriate measures to stop it and report it to the county party headquarters for review. (2) A letter should be sent to the provincial government, requesting the Education Department to comply with the above. It has been discovered that most of the communists arrested in the county are faculty and students from various schools. This shows that there are indeed many reactionary elements hiding in the education sector of the county. In addition to consulting with the provincial government to issue the above orders, it is ordered that they be followed. Meanwhile, the Public Security Bureau arrested Yao Xuan, Wang Chuntao, Wang Panquan, and others on the former (11th) night on Huayang Bridge, Pingjiang Road.

<p>Li Xiushan, residing at No. 62 Dataping Lane, Suzhou, knew Li Xuanting when he was a regiment commander in Nanchong, and Li Xuanting was serving in the army in Yunnan. Now, Li Xuanting has also settled in Suzhou at No. 133 Shiquan Street and changed his business to fermented bean curd. On April 26th of this year, Li Xiushan purchased 6,153 catties of fermented bean curd from Li Xuanting, packed in 170 kerosene cans, for a total price of 840 yuan. The goods were shipped from Huqiu to Beijing and then to Nansuzhou, Anhui, for sale. It was agreed that the payment would be made after the goods were sold. Li Xuanting sent Li Zhengxuan and Dai Yun to Nansuzhou to monitor Li Xiushan's sales. After arriving at the destination on May, they saw that the goods were selling well and colluded with Luo Tingbiao, a special agent of the 7th Division stationed there, to seize the goods and sell them for 2,400 yuan (12 yuan per can). After deducting the original cost, there was a profit of 1,200 yuan. Li Xiushan believes that this profit should belong to him, so he hired lawyer Lu Xiangru to sue in the Wuxian District Court to recover the money.</p>

<p>Xue Fengjie, a resident of Xueqian Street in Wuxi, was once a magistrate during the late Qing Dynasty and had only one eye, hence the nickname "Blind Magistrate". Last year, Xue had an affair with Wang Ruiying (nicknamed "Dragon Queen"), the wife of Pang Xueming, the owner of a certain drugstore, and spent $2,700 to help Ruiying divorce her husband and take her as a concubine. They rented a house in the West Drum Tower Lane and lived together. Two months ago, Magistrate Feng suddenly contracted a heart and dropsy disease. Although he sought medical treatment, it was ineffective. He died the other day. The Dragon Queen then hired lawyer Wu Yintang to demand from the Xue family one hundred thousand yuan in living expenses and a city house worth five thousand yuan that Magistrate Feng had promised her before his death. As a result, there was no resolution. Yesterday was the third day of mourning, and the Dragon Queen, with a white turban on her head, wearing a hemp dress and grass shoes, and a hemp rope around her waist, went to pay her respects. Upon arriving at the Xue residence, she cried and made a great scene in the mourning hall, creating chaos.</p>
<p>Seeing that the situation was not good, the Xue family enlisted the help of lawyers Wang Chengzhong and Wu Yintang to negotiate. They asked Lawyer Wu to persuade the Dragon Queen to return home temporarily for further discussion on the settlement of living expenses. The Dragon Queen was satisfied and stopped crying and went home. It is said that the Xue family has agreed to pay her over one thousand yuan in living expenses, which is expected to be resolved in the coming days.</p>

The matter was reported to Xiao Shaoyuan, the chief of the Eighth Sub-Bureau of Public Security in Shaobo, who sent police officers to arrest Yang Jianpeng, the deceased's brother, and Lu Weikai, who recovered the body. Yang was considered to be pretending to be a relative in order to obtain the money, and Lu was assumed to have embezzled the missing amount. Although Yang and Lu were proven to be who they said they were, it was ineffective. It is said that Yang and Lu have been detained in the bureau for nine days.</p>
<p>Therefore, Yang has asked several colleagues to write a document reporting to the General Bureau of Public Security to prove that he is not pretending to be a relative and requesting that the sub-bureau be ordered to release them. After hearing the news, Chief Xiao of the sub-bureau escorted Yang and Lu to the city yesterday (the 10th) and handed them over to the General Bureau of Public Security for punishment.</p>

<p>The transfer of towns for the Jiangbei Canal Project has been reported previously. Due to the lack of knowledge of the reorganization of the office and the discovery of many publications exposing the contents of the office and raising questions about the reorganization, the people of each county are suspicious. Bao held a meeting in Yangzhou on the 10th to discuss the management of acreage taxes. As a result, it was divided into two categories: (1) seek the consent of those involved in each county; (2) request a meeting of councillors to clarify the truth about the reorganization.</p>

<p>The county government received a telegram from the Finance Department requesting that it use the extra $2 per item allowed for winter grain to offset the shortage of the 19th-year Customs Short-Term Treasury Bonds, with half of the amount to be submitted first.

<p>Since the town of Yugou in the Fourth District of Huaiyin was captured by bandits on the 22nd of last month, hundreds of people have been kidnapped at once, making it difficult to redeem them all. On the night of the 7th, more than a dozen bandits sneaked into Yugou to collect ransoms (i.e., urge the victims to redeem the kidnapped people). The cavalry of the 7th Company of the 266th Regiment of the official army stationed in the town and the police brigade stationed in Yugou discovered this and immediately divided up to intercept and suppress them. The bandits actually resisted arrest until dawn. The bandits were injured five or six people and retreated, while it was reported that the soldiers were also injured one soldier.</p>

<p>Hao Bingzhang, the new director of the Finance Bureau of this county, and Hao Shebo, the manager of the Bank of China, are cousins. Director Hao came to Changshu to take office only two days ago. On the evening of the 10th, at about 11:00 PM, Director Hao met with Hao Shebo at his home to discuss important matters. Xu Junda, a resident of Nanmen, learned that Hao Shebo had an opium addiction and knew that the new Director Hao also had this addiction. He reported to the First Sub-Station and led the arrest by patrol officer Luo Qifan of the sub-station. Xu first knocked on the door of Hao Shebo's house at No. 22 Caodang and then entered with the police officer to search. Eleven opium certificates were found. At that time, Director Hao was already guarded by the police officer and Xu.</p>
<p>Hao Shebo said, "Today I am willing to sign a certificate and go to the bureau with him for questioning tomorrow." Director Hao was able to escape. Later, Cheng Shaoxiang, the mayor of Siqian Town, arrived after Hao Shebo's telegram request for consultation for a long time. Cheng went to the Public Security Bureau to provide temporary bail. On the morning of the 11th, Patrol Officer Luo of the sub-station sent the seized opium certificates and the informant's certificate to the General Bureau. Hao Shebo also submitted a sick report to the General Bureau requesting exemption from summons. Wang, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, sent the sub-station's report and the defendant's sick report to the county government. In the afternoon, Cen Hongzhi, the trial member of the county government, ordered the informant Xu Junda to be interrogated alone and ordered him to await investigation. It is said that Director Hao had an audience with County Magistrate Tan on the night of the incident and requested that the county government send him to the hospital for examination.</p>

<p>The other day, over fifty bandit ships in the area of Xiaozheng Fanbang New Town, Qingpu, were discovered by the Jiangsu Provincial Resident Water Police. They organized and encircled and suppressed them. The bandits relied on their stubborn resistance, and both sides opened fire in a fierce battle for three hours. The bandits were unable to withstand the attack and fled in the direction of Zhuangqiao Fengjing, Jiashan, Zhejiang Province. It is estimated that eight or nine were killed, more than ten were injured, and five were captured alive and sent to Qing for legal action. Upon receiving the report, preparations have been made separately for prevention. Four kidnapped people from Tianning returned. It was learned yesterday that seven people were kidnapped in the Tianning robbery case. After the bandits kidnapped each ticket, they separately questioned the family and sent bandits to investigate. Those who were proved to be poor were released. Two more, surnamed Pan and Lu, had to be redeemed at a good price. The ticket for the woman has been torn up.</p>

<p>Suddenly, on the 9th, a large group of over 500 bandits with submachine guns, Mauser pistols, and other weapons were discovered hiding just a mile from Si'an Town, Changxing County, Huzhou. Fortunately, the Third Battalion of the Second Regiment of the Security Team stationed in Si'an was aware of this. The battalion dispatched troops to defend the area and telegraphed the headquarters of the Second Regiment in the city. Regiment Commander Jiao, upon hearing the news, immediately led a machine gun company to the scene to join the Third Battalion in suppressing the bandits. Seeing that a large army had arrived, the bandits prepared to resist arrest. The two sides exchanged fire fiercely under the moonlight for a long time. The army used machine guns to sweep forward, and the bandits were unable to withstand the attack and retreated. It is said that they fled towards Guangde County in Anhui Province.</p>

<p>On the late night of the 8th, eight or nine bandits suddenly came to Lu A'er's home in Yujiadian, a place three miles away from Nanhao Bridge in the northern township of this city. Each of them was armed with guns and weapons, broke through the back wall and entered.</p>
<p>A'er heard the noise and hid first. His thirteen-year-old son was unable to escape and was kidnapped by the bandits. All the clothes and silver dollars in his house were robbed, with an estimated loss of about 200 yuan. Before leaving, the bandits fired several shots as a warning and kidnapped Lu A'er's son.</p>

<p>Ji Shi, the wife of the late Lu Libin in the Lotus Pond in the southern city of this county, died of illness on the 10th of this month at the age of 67. Ji had a daughter, Lu Yulin, who married Cheng Daizhong of Nanhetou in the 14th year of the Republic of China (both husband and wife work in the education sector). Usually, the couple lives in the Lu residence. Recently, because her mother was seriously ill, Yulin moved all her property away. Zhou Jia, the maternal nephew of the deceased and a lawyer, heard about this and instigated Lu Yulin, saying that a woman has the right of inheritance. So, on the one hand, he published a statement in the newspaper, and on the other hand, he designed to prevent the great-grandson Lu Chengqing and his wife from entering the house for mourning. Zhou Jia also came forward himself, secretly colluding with hooligans and inviting the patrol officer of the Sixth Precinct to help drive them out. By the time the sacrificial great-grandson arrived, Lu Lanbo, the clan leader of the Lu family, came forward to reason with him. Zhou</p>
<p>Jia, the lawyer (from Jiaxing), became even more agitated. The clan leader asked him to file a lawsuit in the county, but he refused. At that time, many onlookers were angered and almost took him to the county to be dealt with by obstructing the funeral. Seeing that the situation was not good, the police officers realized that they had been deceived by Zhou and apologized to the clan leader of the Lu family. Lawyer Zhou saw that he was unreasonable and ran away. The Lu family was then allowed to perform the funeral on time.</p>

<p>Yesterday (around 5:00 PM on the 10th), over a hundred inmates in the Fenghua County Prison suddenly revolted, led by Guan Rongjing, a murderer who had been sentenced to life imprisonment, and Cai Dian, Du Wu, Zhou Zhong, Wu Rongsheng, and four other thieves. Prior to the revolt, the inmates took advantage of the prison guards' lack of vigilance and used kitchen knives, firewood, wine, porcelain, and other items as weapons to break through the prison doors and swarm out. The prison guards were caught off guard, resulting in the escape of 68 inmates. Police officer Lu Naiwu and guard Chen Haijie were seriously injured. Upon hearing the alarm, the security team stationed near the county government immediately dispatched many members to encircle and arrest the escapees. One escapee was killed on the spot, and another was killed by the security team after escaping through the back door of the prison to Sandi. In addition, Sun Jintai, a thief who stole from Sun Biaoqing's house in Xiaowang Temple in Qianyu, was shot in the left leg. As a result, only three escapees were captured: Wang Lianghua, Li Jizong, and Xia Amao. The rest have fled far away. County Magistrate Zhu Maoqi considered that the negligent behavior of Warden Hong Jinqi</p>
<p>led to this disaster and had him arrested. The injured police officer Lu Naiwu and others have been sent to the County Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, the Chongqing branch of China National Aviation Corporation commenced trial flights on the Shanghai-Chongqing air route. The aircraft used was the company's own "Jiujiang" Loening amphibious aircraft. The company's inaugural ceremony procedures were finalized yesterday as seven items: (1) All stand at attention; (2) Sing the Party Song; (3) Salute the National Flag; (4) Pay the highest respect to the portrait of the Premier; (5) Respectfully read the Testament; (6) All staff</p>
<p>bow once to the new Director; (7) Director's address. (Photographed).</p>
<p>After the ceremony, national flags were hung above the main and side entrances of the bureau yesterday.</p>
<p>Notice to staff: Today is the inauguration of the new Director, and all staff within the bureau must be present to welcome him. The administrative section widely distributed notices yesterday, informing all staff and heads of various departments to be present this morning.</p>
<p>Preparations for the Jiujiang's trial flight to Chongqing. (Photo by this newspaper).</p>
<p>The Jiujiang's departure for its trial flight to Chongqing.</p>
<p>The chief and deputy directors of the aviation team, Mr. Smith and Mr. Nie Kaiyi, piloted the aircraft from the Longhua seaplane base at 8:15 AM yesterday.</p>
<p>The company's vice chairman, Hamilton, also accompanied them. Half an hour before the trial flight, the pilot started the engine to test it for about twenty minutes. Necessary supplies were also placed in the aircraft. At that time, the "Shanghai" aircraft heading to Hankou had already prepared passengers and mail after the bell rang eight times, and departed first. The "Jiujiang" aircraft for the trial flight to Chongqing was then pushed onto the dock. Fifteen minutes later, the pilots and others boarded the aircraft one after another, and the sound of the engine rattled. The aircraft accelerated from slow to fast, skimming across the water and</p>
<p>taking off quickly into the sky. The long journey of more than 3,600 li thus began. The success of the future Shanghai-Chengdu aviation enterprise greatly depends on the success of this trial flight. The aircraft must land and stay briefly in Nanjing and Jiujiang. It is scheduled to arrive in Hankou in the afternoon yesterday, stay overnight in Hankou, and continue to fly to Yichang this morning. It will fly to Wanxian tomorrow morning and arrive in Chongqing next Monday, stay overnight, and fly directly back to Hankou from Chongqing on Tuesday, and fly back to Shanghai on Wednesday. A direct flight from Shanghai to Chongqing without stopping can be achieved in twelve hours. This trial flight requires four days because of the detailed survey of the terrain along the way. After the official flight next month, the Shanghai-Hankou route will still have one round trip per day, each trip taking seven hours. The Hankou-Chongqing route will have one round trip per week in the initial phase, each trip taking eight hours. The new American aircraft delivered on the 19th of this month will be used exclusively for the Hankou-Chongqing route, while the original aircraft will still be used for the Shanghai-Hankou route. The Shanghai-Hankou route will still use Jingxun as landing stations, while the Hankou-Chongqing route will use the newly established Yiwan as landing stations. Passengers and mail can get on and off at each station.</p>

<p>Cai Pei went to Nanjing last night. Li Zhonggong, the new director of the China Merchants Bureau, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing and has been residing at No. 200 Avenue Road. After contacting various parties recently, it has been approved that he will formally take office at the bureau at 10:00 AM today. The details of the handover are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Inauguration ceremony: Director Li has scheduled to formally take office at the bureau this morning. Zhou Shian, acting head of the administrative section, ordered the establishment of an auditorium on the second floor of the bureau. It was decorated yesterday afternoon, filled with national flags. In the center of the podium is the portrait of the Premier.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Mr. Li Zhonggong <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>At nine o'clock, all staff must gather in the bureau. When the new Director arrives, all staff will welcome him in front of the auditorium, and the heads of various departments and secretaries will be sent to the front door of the bureau to greet Mr. Li upstairs to the chairman's seat. Yesterday afternoon, the administrative section of the bureau also sent a letter to the police station requesting them to send officers to the bureau to ensure solemnity. As for the staff of the bureau</p>
<p>participating in the welcome, each person will be issued a badge for identification.</p>
<p>Anyone without this badge will not be allowed to enter.</p>
<p>Declaration outline: Today, when Mr. Li takes office, he will prepare to announce a declaration personally written on the reorganization of the bureau's affairs. The declaration is very long, divided into six paragraphs. First, it states the reason for taking office is due to the government's urging, which cannot be refused. Secondly, it describes the past of the China Merchants Bureau and concludes. Thirdly, it describes the reasons for reorganization and the authority to reorganize. Fourth, it describes the criteria for hiring people, adopting talent-based principles.</p>
<p>The declaration was sent to the bureau by Mr. Li around 3:00 PM yesterday and handed over to the administrative section for copying and mimeographing, to be directly distributed to various newspapers today for publication. The most important point in the declaration is to reveal that the major power of the bureau's affairs will belong to the reorganization committee established later. The future methods of the China Merchants Bureau, whether state-owned or commercial, state-managed or still commercially operated, will all be decided by the reorganization committee through public discussion. It is said that all major matters of the bureau's reorganization staff are determined by the reorganization committee, and the Director is only an administrative agency executing the resolutions of the reorganization committee. Cai Pei, the outgoing representative of the Director, Cai Ziping, came to Shanghai to take over for more than a week. Because the new appointment has been determined, Mr. Cai visited Mr. Li's residence yesterday to hand over all the bureau's affairs. Therefore, he left the bureau yesterday. From today, he will go to the bureau again. Cai had been away from Nanjing for a long time.</p>
<p>The official business in the department is very busy. It is said that he resigned from Mr. Li yesterday and took the evening train to Nanjing to resume his original position as Director of the Navigation Administration Department.</p>

After the Japanese expert committee member Yoshino and others arrived in Shanghai, the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu immediately telegraphed Nanjing to discuss the negotiation date with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and others. Yesterday, both parties agreed to have the committee members meet on the 17th of this month to discuss the procedures for conducting negotiations and determine the date of the formal meeting. However, the meeting location, whether in Nanjing or Shanghai, has not yet been decided. In addition to Zhuang Zhihuan, Director of the Telecommunications Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications, the Chinese committee will also be appointed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Wu Nanru, a member of the Treaty Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a member of the Telecommunications Negotiation Committee of the Ministry of Communications (former secretary of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom), will concurrently serve. Yesterday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the Japanese Consul in Nanjing, Uemura, by telegram to inform the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu Kui for reference.</p>

<p>As a result of the bidding, Jiang Xiaojian was selected. The Construction Committee of the Premier's Bronze Statue of All Circles in Shanghai held its sixth plenary meeting in the Road Bureau conference room yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Important issues were decided. Committee members Wang Xiaolai, Ye Huijun, Zheng Chengqing, Wang Binyan, Ye Xiufu, and others attended the meeting. Two models of the Premier's face were displayed at the meeting, but the makers were not identified to ensure fairness. The meeting then opened for discussion, and Wang Xiaolai was publicly elected as chairman to discuss the following results: (1) Discuss the proposal of whether Li Jinfa's model can participate. It was resolved that models without submitted drawings and photos would not be allowed to participate. (2) Discuss which model to adopt. It was resolved to first vote on the model labels A and B to decide. The results of the vote were six votes for B, two votes for A, and two abstentions, so B was elected. (3) Discuss the bidding proposal. It was resolved to open the bids in public. The results of the bidding showed that Jiang Xiao and Zhang Chenbo had the same bid price of 12,000 yuan, but model B was made by Jiang Xiaojian, so Jiang Xiaojian won the bid. (4) Discuss the base of the bronze statue. It was resolved to follow the model made by the Road Bureau and solicit bids for the modified model in the newspaper, with detailed specifications. Committee member Wang Jinzhi was publicly elected to draft and review the specifications.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Three Overseas Chinese Compatriots from the Netherlands Were Expelled and Returned to China <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Propagating Party principles was envied. The Overseas Chinese Association is scheduled to welcome them. Yesterday, three overseas Chinese compatriots who had been deported from Xilibo Island, Wangjiaxi port, returned to China. One was Mr. Liao Peizhi, the editor-in-chief of the local Chinese newspaper "Minsheng Bao," one was Ms. Pan Fengjing, a teacher at the Zhongshan Public School in the local Party office, who was hired by the Central Training Department, and one was Ms. Chen Zhongshu, who was introduced by the Cultural Affairs Department of Jinan University to the local Chinese school. They took the Dutch Java Company's mail ship Zhijinpeng to Xiamen and transferred to the Chinese ship Changan, arriving in Shanghai on the 9th. They were introduced by Mr. Liu Shimu to the local Overseas Chinese Federation and talked to the committee members about their experience of being expelled. The reasons for the expulsion are recorded below. Mr. Liao has been serving in the education and newspaper circles in Nanyang for many years, holding a spirit of fearless confrontation with Dutch imperialists. Last year, he returned to Java and edited the "Daily Telegraph" to Wangjiaxi, where he edited the Party newspaper to promote the Three People's Principles, promote overseas Chinese community culture, and advocate the national salvation movement, all using his sharp pen to make powerful appeals. Therefore, it aroused the jealousy of the Dutch Indian government, and they were always picking on the words published in the newspapers, fabricating crimes and adding accusations. The court illegally sentenced him to fines repeatedly, but Mr. Liao never succumbed and thoroughly implemented his spirit of upholding justice and righteousness, which made the Dutch imperialists even more fearful, so they used their highest means of oppression to order deportation. The most regrettable thing is that Mr. Liao was planning to expand the "Min Bao" and had made considerable progress, but he suddenly suffered this setback and failed to achieve his wishes, which is a major loss to the overseas Chinese news community. It is heard that the position of editor-in-chief has now been taken over by Mr. Chen Guan of the Central Propaganda Department, who is going to take over. What is hoped of Mr. Chen is that he will undertake the mission of the central government, continue Mr. Liao's unfinished business, and save the overseas Chinese from their increasingly declining</p>
<p>crisis. As for Ms. Pan and Ms. Chen, they recently arrived in Wangjiaxi from Shanghai for less than a month. Their entry procedures were very complete, but they were inexplicably deported by the Dutch imperialists with an order without even announcing the reasons. If this is the case, then overseas Chinese will have no place to stand in overseas. This kind of tyrannical behavior by the Dutch imperialists is not a personal issue, but a destruction of international relations and an uncivilized act. I don't know how our country's diplomatic authorities will solve the plight of millions of overseas Chinese. Mr. Liao and others also recounted the humiliation they suffered from the Dutch imperialists before leaving the country, which made people hear it with hair standing on end and tears falling. I write this to tell the Chinese people, what should they think? The committee members of the Overseas Chinese Federation believe that Mr. Liao and others have sacrificed for the country and have suffered dust from afar to return, and will hold a meeting to welcome them.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Japan Orders Quarantine <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Another Difficulty for Passengers Going to Japan: Japan is preparing for the autumn military exercises. Recently, the country has been particularly strict on domestic health and epidemic prevention, and has paid great attention to foreign</p>
<p>ships. During this strict prevention, a floating corpse was suddenly found on the Japanese sea. After the customs medical officer and others went to verify it, it was determined that it was a crew member or sailor on a ship to Japan who died of an epidemic and was thrown into the sea. Since this incident, the Japanese authorities have issued a maritime alert order, designating that any ship from Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, or other Chinese ports to Japan that goes to ports such as Kobe, Nagasaki, and Moji will be ordered to implement quarantine for passengers to prevent the spread of epidemics.</p>
<p>The quarantine method is to order each ship to issue wax boxes to passengers when they board the ship to collect passenger feces and send them to the importing customs doctor for chemical verification. If there is an epidemic, they will not be allowed to land and will be quarantined. All ships from Shanghai to Japan will also implement this.

<p>The municipal government ordered the Finance Bureau yesterday to allocate half of the funds. The municipal government issued an order to the Municipal Finance Bureau yesterday to subsidize the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau's expenses, saying, "Regarding the order, according to the Shanghai County Government's report, the county's public security expenses are urgently needed, please order the Finance and Civil Affairs Bureau to quickly allocate funds according to the case to provide funds for distribution. I hope you will review and order compliance. The order from your government's No. 5927 instruction, the county magistrate reported that the Committee has calculated the provincial and municipal funds and submitted a document requesting your approval and instructions for compliance, stating that the case has been reviewed and the Jiangsu Provincial Government has consulted the government and has ordered the Finance Bureau to send personnel to calculate the case. As for the county's security expenses, which are related to local security, starting from this month, permission is granted to allocate half of the funds to maintain them. I hope you will know and comply with this order, etc. Seeing that your Excellency attaches great importance to local public security, the merchants and people are grateful and unanimously comply. The county magistrate has approved the Finance Bureau to allocate half of the public security expenses for June and July successively for distribution. As for the half of the expenses due for August, the county magistrate has also prepared a letter requesting them, but it is now September and the Finance Bureau has not approved the allocation according to the case. The county's public security bureaus and branches are eager for salaries, even more than waiting for the New Year. The previous arrears due to delayed allocations are very large, and half of the funds are still insufficient. Now that the bandits have not been pacified and the prevention and arrest are important, it is impossible to delay again. The county magistrate's eyewitnesses feel deeply</p>
<p>anxious and should order the Finance Bureau to allocate half of the county's public security expenses monthly according to the case to avoid prolonged delays. All the reasons for the county's public security bureau's urgent need for expenses should be submitted in writing for your review and instructions for compliance, which is for the public convenience. According to this, permission should be granted to continue to allocate half of the funds to provide assistance. In addition to the instructions, the bureau should also comply and allocate the funds according to this order."</p>
<h3 id="e123">The Crisis of China's Tung Oil Trade <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Consulate in Penang reports that tung oil is a unique product of China, but in recent years, the United States has advocated planting to resist it. The former Consul-General in New York of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported on the current situation and prospects of Chinese tung oil in the United States, arousing the attention of domestic industrial circles. Subsequently, the ministry, based on the report from the Consulate in Penang on the crisis of China's tung oil trade, which is sufficient for political reference, has sent a letter to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to copy the original document to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Inspection Bureau for reference. The original report is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>According to the investigation, Sichuan and Guangdong tung oil is a purely Chinese product. In the past, it was only used for waterproofing houses, boats, utensils, etc., and its value was not very high. Recently, with the increasing use of this material in the aircraft industry, electrical industry, and other industries, exports have increased and the value has risen. According to the latest survey, annual exports reach 30 million yuan, ranking third among China's export goods. The largest sales market is the United States. The varnish it produces initially used flaxseed oil, but it is not as dense and suitable as tung oil and is easy to dry, so they have adopted China's</p>
<p>tung oil. However, China is completely using manual extraction and has no fixed standards, so the products are often of varying quality. After being transported to the United States, factories must re-</p>
<p>chemically verify and refine it, which has led them to develop their own strategies for planting tung oil trees. It is heard that the US government has allocated 50 million yuan in Florida to try planting in the largest area. It is expected that it can be harvested in 25 years, then the Chinese tung oil trade will suffer a major blow. What's more, in the South Seas, due to the drop in rubber and coconut prices, the British authorities have proposed planting tung oil trees, then the danger of our country's tung oil in trade is even greater. Because of the relationship between strains, Malaya is most suitable for agricultural operations. Therefore, the rain and dew are all over the territory. However, in recent years, the price of rubber has fallen and the price of coconut has also fallen. Those who are engaged in this business are suffering endlessly. According to the London Telegraph on July 16, the British Products Association's Building Trade Department has been trying to plant tung oil in Malaya, India, Africa, and the West Indies, and will be able to achieve results. The current results of the trials in British territories are still</p>
<p>uncertain, but according to reports from various places, there seem to be good results, especially in northeastern India. If the trial planting is successful, then in the future, the position of our country's important goods in trade will be taken over by foreigners. In recent years, our country's foreign trade position in the international arena has been extremely backward. Today, foreigners are not only engaging in aggression against our country's economy, but also launching fundamental attacks. The future is dangerous and we are shivering with fear. Only if our government informs the industrialists can they be prepared for a rainy day.</p>
<h3 id="e124">A Written Statement from the Chinese Merchants' Straw Hat Export Industry <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Yushang Hat Manufacturing Company, a member of the Chinese Merchants' Straw Hat Export Industry Association, runs a straw hat factory in Yuyao, which is sold abroad and has long been exempted from taxes by the ministry. Recently, the local straw hat donation bureau has been forcibly collecting donations, causing disputes that have not been resolved for a long time. The company has submitted a request to the Zhejiang Finance Department to clarify the matter, as follows: In order to comply with the overseas donation exemption method for overseas straw hats, we are willing to provide a corresponding guarantee and request that the Zhejiang Provincial Export Straw Hat Donation Collection Office in Shaoxing follow the procedures. Our company collects and transports straw hats exclusively for sale overseas. According to the ministry's order, all donations are exempted. We have submitted a request to your department to request that the precedent be followed. We have received your approval No. 218, stating that the overseas straw hat donation exemption method was previously ordered by the Ministry of Finance and has been notified to all bureaus for compliance. If the company's straw hats are indeed sold abroad, they should be exempted from donations in accordance with the overseas straw hat donation exemption method, without the need for separate notification. I hope you will know and attach the approval for temporary storage, etc. Unexpectedly, the Zhejiang Provincial Straw Hat Donation Collection Office in Shaoxing does not comply with the laws and regulations, claiming that they have not received the notification or know the donation exemption method, etc., extorting donations and obstructing transportation, which not only endangers industry and commerce but also disregards the ministry's and your department's orders. Such harsh donations and taxes are not the national intention to protect merchants and benefit the people. For this reason, we submit a request to order the collection office to follow the donation exemption method proposed by the Ministry of Finance and not to unreasonably obstruct it. In the future, if straw hats are exported overseas, our company will provide a corresponding guarantee in accordance with the precedents in Ningbo, Haimen, and other places. Once the export form is received from the Jianghai Customs, the guarantee will be verified and canceled to comply with the ministry's order and maintain commerce. I beg you to issue a prompt notification to all straw hat donation collection offices to comply, which is for the public convenience. Respectfully presented to the Zhejiang Finance Department.</p>

<h3 id="e129">The Social Bureau Mediated the Sino-Japanese Labor Dispute Yesterday <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Huadong News Agency reported that the Shanghai Social Bureau summoned representatives from both the labor and capital sides of the Japanese-Chinese yarn factory at the bureau at 9:00 AM yesterday to begin mediating the factory's labor dispute. The mediation situation is divided into the following records:</p>
<p>Attendees: The attendees included Guo Yongxi, director of the mediation section of the Social Bureau, Wang Guoxian, representative of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Zhang Yaoming, representative of the Municipal Party Department, Qian Zhongnan, translator of the Social Bureau, Wang Zhiqin, recorder, Zhao Bi and Yu Qixiang, labor representatives, Tsuji Keisho, chief manager of the general factory, Xi Chuan, representative of the Japanese Yarn Factory Federation, Cao Shiming, translator, and Cao Shunqing, representative of the Fifth District Party Department and Oikawa, head of the personnel section of the Japanese-Chinese yarn factory, as observers.</p>
<p>Mediation situation: After the formal greetings, Chairman Guo first reported the purpose of the mediation and stated the situation of the crossing of the river yesterday, hoping that the representatives of the labor and capital sides would discuss and concede to each other with the utmost sincerity so as not to disappoint the authorities' mediation efforts. The labor representatives then detailed the reasons for the strike and requested that four additional points be added to the three conditions originally proposed to the factory: (1) Workers must be paid for all commemorative festivals promulgated by the central government; (2) Four former members of the labor union flattered the capital and coerced the workers with concrete evidence, and Wu Zhongyue, a company employee, recently impersonated a representative to report to the capital with the intention of sabotaging the labor union. The labor union requested the factory to fire them; (3) The capital insisted on firing seven workers, including Yu Qixiang, for inciting the labor dispute. The labor side believed that there was no such thing as inciting the labor dispute and the factory's dismissal could not be recognized; (4) Wages must be paid during the strike period. Chairman Guo discussed with the capital side. The capital representative said that the first of the original three articles, the increase of rice subsidies of one unit per day, was not recognized; the second article, wages must not be delayed, could be followed; the third article, stopping night work on Sundays, had now agreed that the workers would not raise it because the autumn was cool. As for the four additional conditions, they were considered to be important issues: (1) The holiday issue was not recognized because all Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai did not have this rule, which was related to the entire industry; (2) The capital did not want to fire the five people who were considered running dogs by the labor side because they had no running dog behavior; (3) The capital believed that the seven people including Yu Qixiang did incite the workers and must be fired; (4) Wages during the strike period were too much of a loss and could not be recognized in any way. However, the capital originally rewarded workers with two days of extra work per month as a subsidy for labor losses, but only this time and must be stopped thereafter. It was also stated that the Pudong Japanese-Chinese yarn factory had always treated workers well and there was no oppression. For example, even if there was</p>
<p>a reward of work at other factories, workers would have to deduct it if they stopped working, but this side did not have this problem. The labor representatives immediately refuted, saying that the capital's so-called preferential treatment was just empty talk. Today, it can be used to generally describe the rest, for example, the monthly reward of work in</p>
<p>other Japanese factories is four days per month, but they only have two days, how can they be considered preferential treatment? Therefore, they requested that the chairman add this point to the three conditions and four requests proposed by the labor union in order to increase the monthly reward of work</p>
<p>from two days to four days. At that time, the Japanese side did not make any comments on this, but</p>
<p>repeatedly stated other preferential conditions to the chairman. The chairman repeatedly persuaded them to no avail. At that time, the official representative believed that the two sides were going in opposite directions and were too far apart, believing that it was necessary to mediate separately. Therefore, he ordered the labor representatives to withdraw and discuss with each other on the other side. As a result, the labor side temporarily reserved the rice subsidy issue until the reward of work was resolved. At that time, it was already noon and it was announced that the meeting would be adjourned. At 1:30 PM, the original representatives rejoined the mediation. However, although the labor and capital sides were able to</p>
<p>sincerely discuss each point, the fundamental aspects could not be approached. Therefore, the chairman truthfully told the representatives of both sides to return to the meeting and decide on the possible scope and make sure not to go to extremes, and then convene both sides to mediate again.</p>

<p>Various Trade Unions Issued Declarations: The workers of the Pudong Japanese-Chinese Yarn Factory went on strike due to oppression from the capital side, hoping to prompt the capital side to reflect. However, the capital side has been tough and has not resolved the situation after two months. Various trade unions have issued declarations yesterday to provide assistance, such as the</p>

<p>Sending the Leader to Meet and Conveying It to the American Evening Post It is said that McGregor, the Director-General of the Board of Works, has sent a letter of protest to the Consular Body because the Chinese authorities in this port have interfered with the construction of a wharf by the Board of Works near McGregor Road on the Suzhou Creek. The Board of Works recently read the letter from the Director-General to Mr. Cunningham, the American Consul, at a meeting, asking the directors to express their opinions and asking the directors whether the work stopped due to the interference of the Chinese authorities should be protected by the patrol and continued. After discussion, the directors decided that since this matter had been submitted to the Consular Body, it would be inappropriate to take action without first consulting with the Consular Corps.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Ministry of Industry and Commerce Develops Trade with Fiji <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Preparing for the Fiji Philippine National Products Exhibition</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce instructed the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce: "In order to comply with orders in the case, I have investigated that the Fiji Philippine Carnival Industry and Commerce Exhibition is held in February every year, and I have repeatedly invited our country to participate. In order to develop trade with Fiji, the Ministry has prepared exhibits and sent personnel to participate at the request of the association in the eighteenth year. After the meeting, it was reported that our country's exports were very popular among the people of Fiji, and that there are many overseas Chinese merchants in Fiji who are very hopeful of promoting national products. However, because all the exhibits brought to the meeting were shipped back and returned after the participants returned home, there was still little contact with the operation of trade. It can be seen that the government's dispatch of personnel to the meeting only fulfilled the friendship of the state, and in order to export national products, merchants should be sent to the meeting by themselves. In view of this, the Ministry approved the letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the presentation from the Consul General in Fiji in November and December of last year, inviting the Carnival Industry and Commerce Exhibition to be held this year, and ordered the former Shanghai Merchant Group Consolidation Committee to convene industrial and commercial groups in Shanghai and companies and manufacturers engaged in South Seas exports to participate, and to raise capital and set up a long-term export agency during the meeting in accordance with business methods to develop trade with Fiji. In January of this year, the Merchant Consolidation Committee replied that the meeting period was very tight and the capital was raised to set up an export agency that could not be completed as scheduled and planned to wait for the next session to prepare for participation. It was also approved to discuss and proceed at any time. Now, according to the Consul General of Fiji, Guang Xukun, he presented the association's letter requesting our country to participate in the 1933 Carnival Industry and Commerce Exhibition, and a copy of the English letter was attached to the Ministry in addition to instructions, and an English letter was copied to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce for reference and processing of the previous case. It is still far from the meeting period, and I hope to plan and advance as soon as possible. Also, according to the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, it has successively submitted reports to the Shanghai National Products Factory Joint Conference that personnel will be sent to the port to discuss holding a national products mobile exhibition, and the names, addresses, goods, and trademarks of the national products factories should be compiled and distributed to overseas Chinese merchants. The former Shanghai Merchant Group Consolidation Committee has replied by telegram that it has forwarded the notice to the China National Products Maintenance Association and various national products groups for compliance, and has ordered the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to inform the silk manufacturers to comply with the case. The Ministry believes that participating in the Fiji Philippine Carnival Industry and Commerce Exhibition and contacting to hold the Singapore National Products Mobile Exhibition are all for promoting national products and seeking to increase exports to the South Seas. Now that gold is expensive and silver is cheap, it is a thousand-year opportunity to expand overseas trade. Since the Shanghai manufacturers have a resolution in front, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which is in a leading position, should take the responsibility of guidance and follow the previous case. When the new port is held, a long-term export agency should be set up to coordinate methods, contact and proceed, so that national products can be sold in the South Seas Islands. The Ministry has high hopes for this order."</p>

<p>Ji'an Road At 9:30 AM yesterday, five robbers broke into No. 8 Guangyu Lane, Ji'an Road, in the concession, with two robbers holding guns to scare and prohibit announcements. It is estimated that about 280 silver oceans worth of clothing were robbed. The owner reported to the patrol room for arrest.</p>
<p>Jixiang Street At about 2:00 AM yesterday morning, four robbers armed with pistols suddenly came to the Huishun Laundry and Dyeing Shop at the intersection of Jixiang Street, Damalu, in the French Concession. They arbitrarily searched and robbed about 240 yuan worth of gold, silver, oceans, and all kinds of clothes and miscellaneous items before fleeing with the loot. The patrol room is now conducting a strict investigation.</p>
<p>Xujiahui Road At about 5:00 PM yesterday, two robbers suddenly came to the house of Mrs. Tong Liang (19 years old) at No. 74 Xujiahui Road in the French Concession. Under the pretext of asking questions, they broke into the inner room and searched everywhere. Because there was nothing of value, they grabbed two gold rings from Mrs. Tong's finger and fled with the loot. Mrs. Tong shouted loudly for arrest and alarmed the neighbors, who chased and intercepted a robber at the intersection of Shuangxing Lane, Xie Xu Road. However, the gun had been discarded. The district police officer of the Second District of the Nuclear Garden Road police station detained the police officer after a preliminary trial by the district chief. The robber confessed his name as Chen Linsheng, 22 years old, from Xuzhou, and directly admitted to robbery without denial. District Chief Wang filed the case with the Judicial Section for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Xuan Aihou Rescued After Being Kidnapped <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Bandits Demanded a Ransom of 300,000</p>
<p>The Amount Was Too Large to Negotiate</p>
<p>The Detectives Fought Bravely</p>
<p>A Total of Two Bandits Were Arrested The Shanghai Commercial Savings Bank Trust Department Director Xuan Aihou, a native of Gaoyou, was kidnapped at 8:40 AM on the 2nd of this month in front of his residence at No. 41 Bailainei Montmarang Road in the French Concession. At that time, the bank sent a letter to various newspapers requesting that they not be published temporarily in order to facilitate the investigation and avoid accidents. Therefore, most newspapers did not disclose it the next day. It has been ten days without any progress. It is now reported that the bandit den was discovered by the French patrol room yesterday morning, and the hostages were rescued on the spot, and ten bandits were captured one after another. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiations at the New World Restaurant After being kidnapped, Xuan's family received a letter from the bandits demanding a ransom of 300,000 gold. The family sent people to secretly contact the bandits several times, and the bandits wanted at least 200,000 yuan. However, because the amount was too large, the negotiations failed. After a long delay, the detectives and inspectors of the special agency of the French patrol room, Jin Jiulin, learned that the bandits were hiding in Room 24 of the New World Hotel in the Public Concession and were waiting for Ling Fang to negotiate. He immediately reported to West Inspector Pei Er and Patrolmen No. 39 West Pei, along with the detectives Li Yaolong, Mao Jingen, Wang Rusong, Qian Yumin, Lu Zhulin, and Bao detectives Zhang Ziying, Zhou Bingcheng, Zhou Buguang, etc., and armed themselves and rushed to the address.</p>
<p>Two Bandits Intercepted Midway Inspector Jin and the patrolmen who were on duty first arrived at the Old Zha Patrol Room and requested assistance. Before they arrived at Room 24, the bandits detected them and fled from the New World. The detectives chased after them and intercepted two robbers on Nanjing Road Yinghua Street and brought them back to the French Patrol Room. After a strict interrogation by the patrol chief, one confessed his name as Zhang Peiqing and the other as Chen Debao, and confessed that the hostage-holding agency was now in a thatched house in Fanjiatun, west of the Hongqiao Airport in western Shanghai. Inspector Jin, after receiving the confession, immediately led the entire team of detectives and patrolmen, all armed and wearing steel armor, and took six cars to Hongqiao.</p>
<p>The search went all the way to Qingpu and arrived at the airport. The Public Security Bureau of the Sixth District, First Precinct, was asked to send police detectives to assist in the arrest. However, the road in the countryside was very narrow and the cars could not pass. The detectives had to get out of the car and walk. Fortunately, the bright moon illuminated the autumn night. The detectives walked more than twenty miles before arriving at Fanjiatun. First, the two bandits identified the location correctly, and the detectives rushed in. However, the bandits had moved to another place the day before. Fortunately, an accomplice was captured in the house, who confessed the location of the new bandit den. The detectives ordered the bandit to lead the way for another ten miles near the border of Qingpu County. They saw a thatched house in the distance and the bandit pointed out that the house was where the hostage was being held. The detectives were preparing to search when the bandits in the house noticed them.</p>
<p>A fierce battle broke out on both sides. When the bandits detected the detectives coming to arrest them, they took out their pistols and opened fire to resist arrest. The detectives also drew their guns and fought back. The two sides fired more than thirty shots in total, lasting about twenty minutes. The bandits were outnumbered and the detectives bravely</p>
<p>stepped forward and captured seven bandits, seizing three pistols with live ammunition.</p>
<p>During the melee, one bandit was shot three times by a detective, wounding his abdomen, leg, right arm. The hostage Xuan Aihou was rescued in the bandit den. At that time, Xuan Jun was startled by the gunshots in the bandit den, and his shock subsided after being rescued. The detectives took the captured bandits, the hostages, and the injured bandits to the airport and returned to the French Patrol Room by car to detain the bandits separately and wait for interrogation and transfer to the government for interrogation.</p>
<p>List of Names of Kidnappers and Hostages Xuan Jun was escorted home, and the injured bandits were sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The names of the bandits are recorded as follows: Zhang Peiqing, Chen Debao, Zhu Sanni, Zhou Jinsheng, Lu Xiaohai, Chu Yunlong, Xi Xiangsheng, Wang Shuji, Qin Boqiu, Zhang Amao (injured in the hospital), and ten others. By the time the detectives returned to the patrol room after the arrest, the east had broken dawn.</p>

<p>Zhang Lin Ruifang Accuses Sun Keji</p>
<p>Of Negligence in Stillbirth Surgery</p>
<p>Please Punish for Negligence of Duty</p>
<p>And Pay 5,000 Yuan in Solatium Sun Keji, a doctor hired by the Red Cross Haig Road Hospital, was recently sued by Zhang Lin Ruifang, a woman from Ningbo residing at No. 36 Qinghai Road, by hiring lawyer Ye Shaoying in the Special District Court for negligence of duty causing injury to others. According to her complaint, the plaintiff was 32 years old. She became pregnant in February or March of this year. In July, she was bleeding from her lower body and went to the Red Cross Haig Road General Hospital for treatment. The defendant diagnosed that the fetus had died and needed surgery to make it fall. The plaintiff's husband agreed to be hospitalized. On the 17th, the defendant first anesthetized the plaintiff and then performed the surgery. On the 23rd, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff had recovered and could be discharged from the hospital. The plaintiff paid the hospital ward fee of 60 yuan, the surgery fee of 100 yuan, and the examination fee of 5 yuan, totaling 165 yuan, and had a receipt. After being discharged from the hospital, the abdominal pain was like a streak, and the bleeding was even worse than before the surgery. The plaintiff's husband personally went to the defendant's residence to report and asked him to come home for diagnosis and treatment. Because he refused, he changed to Bao Long Hospital for treatment. After the German doctors Fei Naxu and Mao Deng diagnosed that the previous uterine surgery was negligent and the placenta had not been removed, the condition was very dangerous. The second operation was performed immediately, and the placenta was removed on the spot. According to the German doctor, fortunately, it was discovered early, otherwise, if it was delayed for another day, there would be a risk of life. Based on the above facts, the defendant has obviously constituted the crime in Article 301, Section 2 of the Criminal Law and should be summoned to be punished according to law, and an attached civil suit orders the defendant to pay the plaintiff a solatium of 5,000 yuan. Yesterday, Judge Wu conducted a preliminary hearing and ordered the hearing to be rescheduled.</p>

<p>The School Fears He Drowned in the Huangpu River</p>
<p>Please Note the Water Patrol Room Lu Lide, a native of Hankou, 21 years old, is currently studying at the Pudong Lujiazui branch of the Customs Tax School. He lodges at the school. He usually studies hard and is highly valued by the teachers. After a certain period of time, academic in-depth study should not be difficult to become a rising tax professional talent in our country. It is unexpected that Lu recently suddenly disappeared. When he left school, at 9:00 AM on the 10th of this month, he informed the school authorities that he would wait for several hours, claiming that he had an appointment with a friend and would return at noon. Unexpectedly, two days have passed and he has not returned to school or sent a letter clearly stating his whereabouts. The school deeply believes that he is very honest and that, unless he returns to school on leave, he must personally or in writing request to continue the leave. There is no action, and there is great fear that an accident will occur, or because of unspeakable hidden reasons, he may commit suicide by drowning in the river. It is still difficult to predict for a while. Therefore, the teacher Wu Mingjiu was sent yesterday to request the water patrol room to order the patrol to pay attention. It is heard that Lu is wearing a rice-yellow suit jacket, white serge suit trousers, and black leather shoes.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Grandmother's Redemption of Grandson <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The efforts of the Child Welfare Association mediated the case of Zhu, an old female servant working at No. 335 Duozhu Mountain Road, Qipu Road, whose two-year-old grandson, Zhu Genfa, was sold by her second son and his wife due to temporary unemployment and difficulty in making ends meet. They sold him for forty yuan to Xie Bingsheng of Lane 1, No. 2, Jiumu Lane, Manzhou Road, as an adopted son. However, the grandmother Zhu was unaware of this sale. After the sale, the old woman was heartbroken, for although she had two sons, this was the only grandson born to her second son. She feared the family line would end and begged Xie to allow her to redeem the child for reunion. However, Xie Bingsheng insisted that the matter was settled by a mutual contract and was privately done, and that he had invited relatives and friends to a banquet to celebrate the adoption. He argued that if he were to allow redemption at will, it would affect his</p>
<p>reputation and insisted on refusing. Xie Bingsheng's old mother, who was about the same age as the old servant Zhu, also deeply loved this adopted grandson and insisted that since he had been bought, he could not be redeemed. Mr. Wei, Zhu's employer, argued with Xie on her behalf, attempting to mediate and offer a monetary redemption, but Xie refused. Seeing the old woman's pain due to his position as her employer, Mr. Wei reported the matter to the China Child Welfare Association. The Association sent Wang Guan'yi and Wang Riru to investigate the circumstances and procedures of the adoption. A Mr. Wang, a relative of Xie Bingsheng, reported on his behalf and verbally promised to return the child upon receiving the money. Zhang, a staff member, photographed the child and registered everything. Afterwards, he went to Qipu Road to inquire about everything from the old servant Zhu, informing her that redemption was possible but required a guarantor. After redeeming the child, he would be sent to be raised by her eldest son in Wuxi to ensure he would not be sold again. A day later, the old servant Zhu provided a written guarantee and asked Mr. Wei Dagang to act as a witness, submitting it to the Child Welfare Association. Wang and Zhang then went to the Xie family</p>
<p>to handle the redemption procedures, with his relative, Mr. Wang, again responsible for the matter. After everything was completed, Zhu was told to prepare the money and paperwork to pick up the child the next day. Unexpectedly, that evening, Mr. Wang and Xie Bingsheng discussed the matter and had a change of heart, insisting on compensation for losses. The Child Welfare Association</p>
<p>had no choice but to let both parties resolve the matter through legal channels. Xie then offered to comply with the Child Welfare Association's proposed solution</p>
<p>and allow Zhu to redeem the child. Therefore, at 3 PM on September 10th, Mr. Wang and Mr. Zhang of the Child Welfare Association, accompanied by Mr. Wei Dagang and old woman Zhu, went to Xie's house, returned the money, prepared gifts, destroyed the contract, burned the receipts, and took Zhu Genfa back. The dispute was finally resolved, and the pearl was returned to its original owner, with the Zhu family reunited.</p>

<p>Recent Amusing Incident in Wusong</p>
<p>Mother-in-law Casually Asks Date of Birth</p>
<p>Young Bride Confused and Answers Incorrectly</p>
<p>Leading to the Groom's Family Returning the Bride. Mao Asheng, whose ancestral home is Shaoxing, currently resides at the Li family residence in Xizhen, Wusong. He is forty years old, with a gentle, honest, diligent, and thrifty nature. Every day, after finishing his business, he helps his wife with household chores. His wife, Zhao, is about the same age and of medium stature. In her youth, she was beautiful and skilled at handling people, always speaking kindly and pleasantly, so everyone nearby knew of her as "Mother Asheng." They have two sons, the eldest named Mao Xi, who is fifteen years old. Zhao is planning to find a child bride to avoid difficulties in finding a suitable marriage later.</p>
<p>Encountering Baozhen as a Daughter-in-Law. Zhou Jiaqi, who lives nearby, has a relative named Gong, a widow from Beixin Town, Chongming. Her family is poor, and she has six children, half boys and half girls. Since her husband died, she has no support. This spring, she brought her daughter Baozhen, who is thirteen years old, strong, and pretty, to Wusong to stay at Zhou's house, seeking a spouse. Zhao learned of this and, upon seeing the girl, found her perfect. As the opportunity arose, she feared losing the chance and asked Zhou to act as matchmaker. They agreed on a betrothal gift of eighty-four yuan, and the girl was immediately betrothed and began living with the Mao family as a child bride. After Baozhen came to the family, she ate and went everywhere with Mao Xi. Asheng and his wife were delighted to see the young couple getting along so well, and their family life was happy. Who would have thought that troubles would arise, which were beyond anticipation?</p>
<p>Suddenly Asking the Date of Birth. One day, Zhao had nothing to do and suddenly asked Baozhen when her birthday was. Although the girl was tall, her mind was still immature. Suddenly asked by her mother-in-law, she panicked and answered incorrectly. Zhao became suspicious and unhappy. Busy-bodies further speculated that the girl was a widow, etc. Zhao ignored what others said but was more anxious after hearing this. Fearing that keeping the girl would be detrimental to her son, she discussed returning her to her mother's home with her husband. Asheng did not agree because there was no evidence. Zhao argued with her husband every day, and the sound of quarreling never ceased. She even cried every day. Asheng was by nature gentle and tolerant and used those words to deal with his wife, but Zhao only became more suspicious.</p>
<p>Abandoning Husband and Son to Flee. One day, Zhao took advantage of her husband's absence on business and fled alone with a small bundle. When Asheng returned home and found out, he searched everywhere but found no trace. It was not until two weeks later that he learned Zhao had returned to her mother's home in Shaoxing. He went to welcome her back, but she seemed to have mental problems. Later, neighbors advised Asheng that if he did not divorce the girl, the old couple might not be able to protect themselves fully. Therefore, Asheng agreed.</p>
<p>Unmarried Couple Separated. After Asheng discussed and finalized the matter with the matchmaker the other day, he notified Baozhen's mother, Gong. Gong immediately returned to Wusong and refunded all the betrothal money. Asheng also returned the horoscopes, and the girl was taken away by her mother. From then on,</p>
<p>they parted ways, and the couple became strangers.</p>

<p>Yuan Qingshan, a Henan native residing in a lane on Wangzhi Road, in the French Concession, is twenty years old, well-dressed in Western style, with a broad face. He is a university student studying at a certain school. Mrs. Wu Zhu, residing at No. 124 Xinxin Lane, Jinshenfu Road, accused Yuan in the French police station of criminally seducing her daughter Wu Abao (sixteen years old this year) to the New China Hotel, where he forcibly raped her, requesting prosecution. After investigation, the head detective ordered detective Ding Wensheng to arrest Yuan. Yesterday, he was brought to the French court for investigation. The plaintiff, Wu Zhu, stated the previous situation. Upon questioning Wu Abao, the girl confessed that she had gone to the Great World with her younger brother a few days ago.

<h3 id="e147">Letter Requesting Strict Prohibition of Red Pills <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Hereby, citizens of this city, Zhang Qiutang, Lin Zhizhong, and Wang Youzhai, have sent a letter to various agencies requesting a strict prohibition of red pills to eliminate the scourge of drugs. The letter states (details omitted): In our humble opinion, the harm of red pills is greater than that of opium. Those in the lower classes who cannot afford to smoke opium often use red pills as a substitute. As a result, the sales of red pills have increased, and the harm caused by red pills has deepened. Although the authorities have repeatedly issued strict prohibitions, these have had little effect within the concessions, where prohibitions are lax, and sellers and users are everywhere. It is even heard that those involved in this trade have large-scale organizations, with some people responsible for transporting the pills and others for selling them. Some are even blatant and never exposed. For example, Yao Guiji and others in the French Concession sell as much as several million yuan worth of red pills annually. According to a report on the sixth (of this month), the police arrested a woman selling red pills at No. 790 Fujian Road. Although the court sentenced her to imprisonment and a fine, the source of the red pills was not thoroughly investigated, and the cunning merchants who package and transport the pills can still evade the law. To expect the elimination of drugs in such a way is like climbing a tree to catch fish. If this situation is not remedied, our people will ultimately perish from red pills even if they do not die from opium. Qiutang and others, witnessing this, feel heartbroken and cannot remain silent. Therefore, they jointly appeal to you to quickly urge the concession authorities to strictly prohibit red pills and show no leniency, so that the cunning merchants who sell drugs can be brought to justice and the people’s anger can be appeased, and the scourge of drugs can be eliminated. They are immensely grateful for your public service, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Case of the Seized "Songshan Pill" and Arrest <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Relief Association investigators Gu Shaoting, Lin Yongfang, and others went to the "Songshan Pill" ship entering Xiamen yesterday morning to investigate abduction. They found a man and a woman with two young girls. The investigators found their behavior suspicious and questioned them. According to the man, Tang Ashu, and the woman, Tang Sangshi, they were a married couple. One of the girls was their niece and the other their niece from the wife’s side. When asked, the so-called niece, named Ashun, seventeen years old, said that Tang and others were pimps and madams taking them to Xiamen to sell them into prostitution. The so-called niece from the wife’s side, named Dong Juying, fifteen years old, from Ningbo, Jiangdong, Sanguantang, said her father's name was Dong Caifa. Tang Sangshi was her family’s wet nurse. She said she would take her to Xiamen to play, but she did not know the purpose. The investigators found clear evidence of abduction. Since it had been discovered, they could not allow them to fall into a life of prostitution. They immediately called the water police to arrest them and take them to the Lujiazui Shui'an Police Station. Chief He interrogated them. The abductors confessed that they were taking them to the Shuanglan Hall and Yaoer Hall in Xiamen to sing. Ashun had already been sold into prostitution before. Juying was still a virgin, and clients could light large candles for her, etc. Chief He ordered detectives to transfer the 1,000 yuan to the local court for preliminary hearing. The defendants were detained, and the two girls were sent to the association for care.</p>

<p>Passengers' belongings were robbed clean, and more than a dozen people were kidnapped.</p>
<p>The Coastal Patrol Office of Wusong Fort, Taiwan, received a telegram from Wenzhou the day before yesterday stating that a merchant ship of the China Shipmasters Association, loaded with passengers and goods from Shanghai, was sailing near Wenzhou when two large sailing ships suddenly appeared and blocked their path. More than a hundred bandits carrying weapons boarded the ship and plundered it, robbing all the passengers' belongings. Because the ship carried very few passengers and no large sums of money, the bandits were not satisfied. Before leaving, they kidnapped more than a dozen people and took them to the bandit ship. After receiving the report, Director Wu immediately dispatched the "Jingxing" gunboat to pursue and rescue the kidnapped people.</p>

He went to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but the medicine was ineffective. He died at 6:30 yesterday morning. It is said that Hu was a posthumous child and married his wife this spring.

<p>Soldier Zhou Han Wounded Last night around 7 p.m., Zhou Han, a soldier from Jiangxi stationed in the First Battalion, Twenty-Sixth Regiment, Thirteenth Brigade, Fifth Division of the South City, was traveling on the Hua Shang Route 3 circular tram No. 45 from Laoximen on business. It has always been customary for soldiers in the Chinese area to purchase half-price tickets on trams to facilitate both parties. At that time, Zhou's journey originally cost six cents, so he paid three cents. However, the conductor of No. 36 forced him to buy six cents. Zhou quickly showed him the symbol and the arm badge of the messenger soldier. The conductor said that the symbol and arm badge were useless. Zhou, hearing this, believed that the conductor was intentionally insulting soldiers and questioned him. Before he could finish speaking, the conductor used a West-style sharp key to violently strike Zhou on the head, creating a hole in his left forehead, and blood flowed profusely. The patrol police of the Second District General Administration at that location took off the conductor's copper hat badge and took the injured soldier to the Second District General Administration. After a brief questioning by Director Wang, seeing that Zhou's reasons were sufficient, he ordered him to return to the camp temporarily and summon the conductor to the district this morning for questioning and further investigation.</p>

<p>Husband Unheard Of</p>
<p>Forced to Divorce Li Lanqing (née Chen), a woman from Ningbo, now twenty-seven years old, was married to Chen Anfu by her mother when she was twenty years old. Only after the marriage did she learn that her husband had no business and was also gluttonous and lazy. Her father-in-law, seeing his son so useless, died in depression. She had only been married for forty days when Chen abandoned his family and disappeared without a trace. She had no choice but to return to her mother's home. Her father had passed away, and she and her mother relied on spinning and weaving to make a living. As her mother's strength gradually declined and her younger brother could not take care of her, Chen has been gone for seven years, and his whereabouts are unknown. She believes her life is bitter, having married a bad husband and been abandoned for many years. But the days ahead are long, and it is difficult to endure the hardship. Therefore, she has hired lawyer Chen Wenxiang to write a petition to the local court for divorce, citing abandonment and neglect and requesting a divorce. Yesterday afternoon at two o'clock, Judge Wang Qufei opened the second court to hear the case. The defendant Chen Anfu's address is unknown and cannot be served, so he was not present. Only the plaintiff Li Lanqing, accompanied by her lawyer Chen, was present to testify about the previous events. Lawyer Chen requested service by public notice. The judge approved the request and ordered it to be processed.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Province Preparatory Office for Compulsory Education, in order to conduct a practical investigation of local education, has hired Jin Yingyuan as an investigator and correspondence course student itinerant instructor. A special letter was sent to the education bureaus of various counties, stating: "As the period of political tutelage begins, many things need to be done. The vigorous implementation of universal education is particularly urgent. Since the establishment of our office, we have been actively studying the issue of universal education with the cooperation and assistance of the education bureaus of various counties. We have never ceased our efforts. We have long recognized the importance of issues such as teacher training and education statistics, and have been praised by the central and provincial education administrative agencies. However, considering the vast area of our province, further concrete research on the special needs of various counties cannot be achieved merely through circular surveys and discussions. Moreover, our office, on behalf of teacher training, has nearly 2,000 correspondence course students who have spread across more than 50 counties. We should also send personnel to guide them from time to time to increase actual education efficiency. Now, we have specially hired Mr. Jin Yingyuan as the local education investigator and correspondence course student itinerant instructor to actively work in various counties. Mr. Jin has served as a special commissioner for local education in Jiangsu Province, as well as teaching positions in provincial and county normal schools and experimental primary schools, and as the director of the county education bureau. He has sufficient knowledge and experience. In the future, his achievements should be considerable. When he arrives in your county, we hope you will provide him with assistance, allow him to stay, and provide him with food and transportation at his own expense. In addition to separate letters, we are sending this letter to inform you. Please investigate and act accordingly."</p>

<p>Elected New Officers, Amended Article 41 of the Bylaws, Restricting Teams Added to Eight From Competing Outside the City. The Official Season is Scheduled to Begin on October 11, and Friendly Matches Will Begin on October 4th. The Shanghai Westerners' Football Association held its annual meeting at the Asia Literary Society the day before yesterday. Vice President Ford chaired the meeting. After passing the annual work report and financial statements, the new officers were elected. Grimshaw was elected as the President, Ford, Quail, and Leder as Vice Presidents, Hamson as the Secretary, and White Ting as the Secretary and Referee Chairman. Stethard, Edward, and Peterkiss were elected as committee members, all of whom were re-elected. Then, it was proposed to amend the bylaws by deleting the words "or the Chinese Physical Education Advancement Association" listed in parentheses in Article 41, making the bracketed text the main text of the article, and deleting the small note attached to the parentheses for explanation. After some discussion by Belachan, Hamson, and Peterkiss, and a substantial explanation by Hao Boyang of the General Association, it was passed by the members. According to Article 41 of the bylaws, in general, any club, team, or member of a team that joins the Westerners' Football Association may not go to another city to play a game or participate in a game not organized by the association (Chinese Physical Education Advancement Association) without the prior consent of the association's executive committee. The executive committee has the right to review all financial accounts for going to another city to play a game. The words "or the Chinese Physical Education Advancement Association" were initially added by resolution of the executive committee without being passed by the general meeting, so a bracket was added with a small note explaining the origin. Now it is proposed to ratify this at the general meeting, hence this proposal to amend the bylaws. Furthermore, the association has scheduled the official season to begin on October 11, and friendly matches will begin on October 4.</p>

As the whistle blew, the players from both sides dashed onto the field. In the initial stages, the Expedition Team seemed in no hurry to attack, focusing on passing the ball while showcasing individual skills.

<p>(4) A Peculiar Kick, Everyone Cheers Wildly</p>
<p>The Expedition Team remained unfazed by the goal and continued to play without urgency. At 5:25 PM, the Chinese goal was under siege. Dai Linjing, Chen Yutian, and Chen Guangyao all had powerful shots, but the Chinese goalkeeper made excellent saves. At 5:26 PM, Li Huitang battled with two Chinese defenders for the ball. Li flicked the ball backwards with his foot, gaining possession and shooting from the spot. The shot was not particularly fast, but it was perfectly placed, curving towards the right corner of the goal. The goalkeeper was caught off guard, and the ball sailed into the net. Spectators gasped at the brilliance of the play. After leveling the score, the Expedition Team gradually displayed their skills, putting the Chinese team on the defensive. The Expedition Team launched frequent attacks, and had the Chinese goalkeeper been less capable, the score could have been much higher.</p>

<p>(5) Long Shot, High Strike, As You Wish</p>
<p>At 5:35 PM, Li Huitang took a long-range shot. The ball flew high, hit the top of the goalpost, bounced down, and landed directly into the net. The goalkeeper was unable to react. The Expedition Team scored, taking a 2-1 lead. The Expedition Team continued their attack until halftime. The first half ended with the Expedition Team winning 2-1. In the second half, play alternated between the two teams. A Chinese defender committed a foul, resulting in a free kick. Li Huitang took the kick, and the ball flew into the net. The Expedition Team scored their third goal. From then on, the Expedition Team focused on displaying their skills rather than attacking, even when they reached the Chinese goal.</p>

<p>(6) Chinese Players' Last-Ditch Effort</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, as the match neared its end, the Chinese players launched a fierce counterattack. At 6:00 PM, the Chinese forward passed the ball past the Expedition Team's final line of defense. The right winger crossed the ball to the center, approaching the Expedition Team's goal. Zhou Xianyan rushed out to intercept, but was unable to prevent a goal. The second half ended with a 1-1 draw, resulting in an overall score of 3-2 in favor of the Expedition Team, with one penalty kick.</p>

<p>(7) Overview of Skills, Criticizing the Talented</p>
<p>In terms of individual skills, the Expedition Team's players were impeccable. However, their performance was overly playful, leading to a less than satisfactory result. Those unfamiliar with the Expedition Team might say that only Li Huitang stood out, while the others were mediocre. This is perhaps a misconception, as teamwork and individual effort were not fully displayed. Some argue that the Chinese team was not a worthy opponent for the Expedition Team, limiting their performance. Perhaps this is true, but the match on September 1st against a stronger opponent will reveal the Expedition Team's true potential. (It is reported that on the 1st, the Expedition Team will face the Dutch United Team, with the Dutch Royal Family Celebration Committee donating a silver cup to the winner.)</p>

<p>Anecdotes from the Commemoration of the Premier's First Uprising</p>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>This newspaper has already reported on the commemoration of the Premier's first uprising, held by various sectors of the city at the Fangbang Bridge Republican Cinema. Here are some trivial details I observed that day. I arrived at the venue at 9:00 AM. The entrance was packed with people. Fortunately, there were Boy Scouts standing on both sides to maintain order, allowing me to push through the crowd, sign my name, and receive a printed leaflet from the propaganda department. Upon examining it, it detailed the events of the Premier's uprising in Guangzhou eighteen years before the founding of the Republic. At that time, after the Sino-Japanese War, the navy was destroyed, and the country's defense was lost. Taking advantage of the public's anger, the Premier and Lu Haodong secretly went to Guangzhou to start an uprising. After taking my seat, I observed that about 70% of the representatives present were under the age of thirty, and the remaining 30% were under the age of forty. I jokingly said to a friend next to me, "When the Premier launched his first uprising, most of the representatives from various groups attending today were not even born yet. Now they are all followers of the Premier, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the Three Principles of the People being believed by everyone." Hanging on the stage was an enamel bust of the Premier. The four walls were covered with various slogans written on three-foot-wide and four-foot-long white paper, such as "(Commemorate September 9th, expedite unification, develop production, and solve people's livelihood problems)" and "(Commemorate September 9th, abide by the Premier's instructions)," which were very eye-catching. Yang Qingyuan, the Minister of Propaganda, presided over the meeting and reported the purpose of the meeting. He detailed the Premier's various revolutionary experiences and difficulties from the first uprising in Guangzhou at the age of 36 to the opposition to Yuan Shikai. He also mentioned that some comrades within the party felt that the revolutionary spirit was generally declining, and that they should invigorate their spirits, continue the Premier's legacy from the first uprising, and strive forward until the Premier's instructions were fully realized. When Tong Xingbai spoke, he recounted the Premier's original intention of the uprising, the reasons for its failure, and the Premier's continued and tireless efforts after the failure. He presented the information as if counting family treasures, making it a history of the revolution. His composed demeanor and accurate statements earned him a lot of applause. The weather was unusually hot that day. The venue was crowded, making the temperature very high. Some people who did not bring folding fans used their hats and the printed leaflets from the propaganda department as fans, waving them non-stop. From a distance, they looked like butterflies fluttering in the wind, which was quite a sight. Most of the female comrades were sweating profusely, wiping their faces with handkerchiefs. The sound of complaining about the heat was endless. A certain school led more than a hundred students to participate in the meeting. Because there were no seats in front of the stage, they went upstairs. The crowd was noisy, causing the speaker to stop speaking for three minutes due to the overpowering sound. The Boy Scouts from the labor union training institute worked hard to maintain order, and the meeting was finally restored. The main points of the other speeches were: commemoration should not focus on formalities but on practical action, and revolution requires first reforming the heart in order to be just and selfless. I returned home and recorded this to remember and not forget.</p>

<p>Stinky Neighbor</p>
<p>— Fei Jiaobao</p>
<p>Accountant Tai Baosun told me a rather strange story yesterday. His office has always been next to a toilet. When he first joined the accounting department of the Commodity Exchange, there was a toilet next door. Later, when he joined the accounting department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company as an assistant, the office next door was also a toilet. He thought it was a coincidence at first, but recently, when he joined the Sanbei Steamship Company, his office was in a corner of a small building with a rather quiet environment. He opened a small door in his office and was shocked to see another toilet. He wondered why this was the case and why he was so destined to be near toilets. Someone said that these "yellow and white objects" [money] contain a lot of ammonia. Since Mr. Xiong's job is to be with money day and night, the ammonia can be used to awaken his spirit when he is surrounded by the stench of money. Is this the reason? (Returned Payment)</p>

<p>A Guest Recounts Zeng Nongran's Magnanimity</p>
<p>— Kengbo</p>
<p>Zeng Nongran of Hengyang is a well-known calligrapher in Shanghai. Nowadays, a bad habit has emerged: whenever a calligrapher or painter becomes famous, their works are often imitated. Often, counterfeit products flood the market, and the skillful imitators can even deceive the eye. A guest recounted that one day Zeng Nongran was chatting at a friend's house when a housemate brought four short screens and asked the friend to identify whether they were genuine or fake Zeng's works. As soon as the friend saw them, he knew they were fake, so he smiled and said to the housemate, "This gentleman is Zeng Nongran himself. You can ask him to look at them." Zeng glanced at them and nodded, saying, "These are indeed my writings. There is nothing wrong with them." The friend remained silent. The housemate was overjoyed and said, "Everyone said they were fake because the price was too low, but now that Mr. Zeng says there is nothing wrong with them, all my doubts are dispelled." After the housemate left, the friend said, "Aren't you worried about damaging your reputation by casually admitting that they are genuine?" Zeng smiled and said, "Calligraphy and painting are mere objects. What harm is there if fake ones can deceive the eye? Those who rely on imitating my name for a living would starve to death on the costly Shanghai sea if no one recklessly collected them. I can't help people in need. Why be stingy with this small indirect benefit and argue with them? How petty would that be!" The friend praised him, saying, "You are truly a generous man, beyond our reach." Another person recounted that a fellow villager of Zeng showed Zeng a scroll with Zeng's signature, which was also a counterfeit. Zeng saw that the writing was too poor, so he falsely said, "I wrote this after I recovered from a sickness." He then took a brush and added two lines in a blank space, saying, "I wrote this in the past, when I had just recovered from my illness. My wrist strength was completely gone. Looking at it again today, I am filled with shame. Therefore, I write these few words to show my fault." Those who saw it said that these thirty words were extremely lively and wonderful. From the above, it can be seen that Zeng's magnanimity is remarkable. Mencius said, "Those who hear of the ways of Liu Xiahui become generous. The stingy become generous." The same can be said of Mr. Zeng.</p>

<p>A Discussion on the Progress of Film</p>
<p>— Miao Xiu</p>
<p>When Theda Bara rewatches the short comic films she assisted Roscoe Arbuckle in making, or when Rowland V. Lee rewatches the moustache detective films he made before, and then you teach them to watch their newly successful talkie, they are probably getting some sense of old and new. Within these sentiments are several ingredients: A kind of technological progress, a kind of shifting direction, a kind of career success, and a kind of hope to improve further.</p>
<p>Let's think about it. How many years of history does foreign film have? It is not easy to have today's achievements in natural evolution and the efforts of participating molecules. Recalling our China, in this industrially backward and unstable society, all construction has little progress, but the film industry can still struggle under this environment. Although it is not as good as the United States, this spirit is also worth our reflection.</p>
<p>Therefore, those who expect the progress of our country's film industry should not say how good foreign films are and how inferior our country's films are, because history is not as long as theirs, capital is not as sufficient as theirs, the environment is not as stable as theirs, and the audience is not as universal as theirs. Naturally, our country's films should be backward. But in fact, if we can really make a scientific comparison of history, capital, etc., I am afraid that today's Chinese films are not as far behind foreign films as they were yesterday. It is only strange that a generation of people think that foreign films are always good, while Chinese films are not worth a glance. This kind of foreign-flattering mentality is enough to destroy the country. If I tell them the fact that the Japanese love their own films and reject American films, I am afraid it is no less than writing a small history of national humiliation.</p>
<p>Recently I have seen two good films, such as the Star Film Company's "A Romantic Woman" (Chinese film) and the Fox Company's "Sunny Side Up" (foreign film). Although I dare not say that "A Romantic Woman" is better than "Sunny Side Up", in fact, why must it be said that Miss Xuan Jinglin's performance is not as good as Janet Gaynor's?</p>
<p>Ah, what is lacking is that Chinese films are silent films, while foreign films are all talkies. Then here I hope that the Star Film Company's "Sing-Song Girl Red Peony" will be released quickly so that ordinary Chinese people who follow the trend can also see Chinese films with complete dialogue and can understand that there are indeed people in domestic films who are working hard and moving towards the road to success.</p>

<p>Travels in Southeast Asia (47)</p>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the ship, I met a Malay merchant who was a Christian and could speak English. I talked to him about the true meaning of Jesus, who did not spread his teachings with cannons but offered the right cheek after being struck on the left. I compared this with the different approaches of Eastern cultures like Confucianism and Buddhism, which are more powerful than today's Westernization. The Malay man said that India is now in revolution, and Gandhi has been arrested, indicating a resurgence of Eastern nations. I said that it is not only the use of force by nations that matters, but also Eastern culture should use moral education to save the West. He agreed to promote my Kunhua Datong Doctrine [a doctrine of universal harmony and equality].</p>
<p>Life on the ship is very good for health, so Westerners often use sea voyages as a way to recover from illness. Why don't Chinese people learn from this? Every time I travel by ship, I feel it is much better than being on land. The environment is quiet, and worries are far away. Reading, writing poetry, and enjoying the sea clouds are very pleasant.</p>
<p>Since the death of my mother, I studied Buddhism under Mr. Gui Bohua in Japan for fourteen years and became accustomed to abstaining from meat and fish. In recent years, I have often traveled to Guangdong and Guangxi and sometimes have been involved in military affairs. In places where the water and soil are not suitable, and food is inconvenient, I have great difficulty. I feel uncomfortable even if I eat a little fish or shrimp. But on the Western ship, eating Western food, under the influence of the environment, I also eat beef. The smell of fish and meat is just as Yuan Zicai described: "I hold my nose and swallow quickly, unable to distinguish the taste." But recently, I obtained a Collection of Protecting Life Paintings, which uses Buddhist compassion to create paintings, and my friend Ma Yifu wrote a preface, quoting the poems of Su Shi and Bai Juyi about eating vegetarian food, describing opening a can as opening a coffin. After reading it, my old ideas resurfaced, and I can no longer hold my nose and swallow fishy things. The power of psychology is so great.</p>
<p>On the 11th, at 7:00 AM, we arrived at Port Klang and stopped until 5:00 PM. I disembarked with Mr. Chen and took a car to the Guanyin Temple, costing only 30 cents per person because we shared a ride. The Guanyin Temple is a small temple, but the temples in Southeast Asia are all very beautiful and clean. This is probably just the original name, which has been used until now, and it is no longer just a pavilion. Mr. Zhuang Mingchuan was very welcoming. There were many women offering incense. Unfortunately, they were all illiterate. The rickshaws here are wider than in Singapore. At 9:00 AM, we took a car to Kuala Lumpur, costing 1.60 yuan for both of us. We allowed it to pick up passengers along the way. We passed several large iron bridges and small river bridges. The forest was deep and quiet. The workers were in the rubber forest, and the weather was not hot. The rubber forest was very clean. Sometimes, red houses could be seen nestled in the forest, which were the villages of the local people. My friend Lin Fuyan from Java has repeatedly told me, "If you travel to Java, you can prove Lao Tzu's ancient Datong philosophy, and you will realize that Confucius's teachings are inferior to Lao Tzu's, and that Lao Tzu's teachings can truly achieve great governance." I believe him. Now, although I have only briefly arrived in Kuala Lumpur and passed through the countryside, I already feel that I can prove most of it without having to go to Java.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Emerald Bamboo's Tears Stain a Maiden's Heart, Red Lotus Sheds, a Young Woman's Soul Departs</p>
<p>Who knew that less than three months after Cuiyun's marriage, the situation would change drastically, and even Zhang Yiqing's attitude would change? This was like the rulers of dynasties who, upon seizing power, spoke of eliminating tyranny and bringing peace, reducing punishments and lessening taxes, but once they had gained power, they revealed their autocratic faces and used all sorts of means to oppress you. Cuiyun inquired and found out that he had a wife living in the countryside of Ningbo who didn't come to Shanghai. This was true. He returned to Ningbo once a year, or sometimes once every two or three years. This was also true. His wife was a country woman from Ningbo, very ugly and clumsy, like a rough servant. Zhang Yiqing didn't like her; this was even more true. But in addition to this, there was another woman. Zhang Yiqing hadn't told his friends, and he wasn't willing to reveal her. Unexpectedly, Cuiyun didn't know that this old woman left in the countryside of Ningbo was Zhang Yiqing's original wife, his wife from his humble beginnings. This was the woman his parents had found for him when he was an apprentice in a small shop, and of course, she didn't suit his taste. When he became successful, he secretly took a lover in Shanghai. This woman was said to be the wife of one of his friends, also a fellow native of Ningbo. This fellow townsman was ten years older than Zhang Yiqing. He had worked hard all his life and just managed to accumulate seventy or eighty thousand in assets, but as soon as he had wealth, his health failed. It was truly (After gathering nectar from a hundred flowers to make honey, for whom is he busy?). He died of consumption, leaving behind a young widow. This was originally a second wife, nineteen years younger than her husband. This fellow townsman was a good friend of Zhang Yiqing. On his deathbed, he entrusted this young widow to Zhang Yiqing, asking him to take care of everything. Who knew (entrusting a chick to a weasel)? Zhang Yiqing didn't care about the friendship with the deceased. He used his means to seize her, like Zhong Jinshi collecting gifts. He took everything, people and belongings, without exception. Emperor Zhaolie entrusted his son to Zhuge Kongming, saying, "If he can be assisted, then assist him. If he cannot be assisted, then take over yourself." Now Zhang Yiqing had only added half a character to Liu Xuande's edict of entrusting the orphan, turning it into "If she can be assisted, then assist her. If she cannot be assisted, then marry her." He also did his utmost for his old friend's widow. Originally, the old friend's wife had been married to her husband for less than five years before becoming a widow. Her youth was cut short like this, and she had no children. Zhang Yiqing, bearing the weight of the entrusted orphan, often came to inquire. He had abandoned his poor wife in the countryside, and he himself was like a single man. A lonely man and a lonely woman are like dry wood and a raging fire. This was only natural. Moreover, Zhang Yiqing's skills were originally good, so not even three full years after his old friend's death, he had already taken his place.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Gold Market Plummets Ten Taels <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>The political turmoil in Japan has had a major impact. Yesterday, the 12th, the official gold price suddenly plummeted, with drastic changes. Both the morning and afternoon markets experienced fluctuations of up to six taels. In the end, it dropped drastically by more than ten taels, breaking through the sixty-tael mark. It is believed that the turmoil in the Japanese cabinet has raised concerns about a potential devaluation, affecting exchange rates. Bills of exchange have also loosened, causing great panic and anxiety. There was an oversupply in the market. Companies such as Yuan Mao, Yongfu Chang, Yongcheng Chang, etc., rushed to sell. Early in the morning, large silver bars were reduced by an eighth, and silver prices fell by a quarter. Although the gold price initially rose slightly at the opening, the atmosphere turned negative afterward, and it steadily declined. After a drastic drop of more than five taels, it suddenly plummeted to fifty-seven or fifty-eight taels, with no major purchases. Later, sellers became even more insistent, and foreign exchange rates weakened further. The market sentiment was extremely sluggish, leading to an even more severe decline. The waves were surging, with a sudden drop of five taels. Finally, it plummeted to between fifty-three taels, where it had been stable for several days. Yesterday's sudden turmoil and dramatic changes before the settlement were unexpected and unpredictable.</p>
<p>The morning session opened with a slight increase of three cents. The initial October price rose slightly by three cents, reaching 563 taels. Silver prices remained unaffected despite the contraction. The gross price gradually decreased by more than two taels, reaching only sixty taels and eight cents. The exchange market was stable. Taiwan, etc., bought October British gold at seven pence six two five. The China Banking Corporation made a deal for December US dollars at thirty-nine yuan eight seven five. When the shilling rate was announced, it was priced at sixty-one taels and forty-five cents, without any further changes. The atmosphere remained peaceful at around sixty-one taels. Internal British gold also remained unchanged. Banks such as Zhongri absorbed October six two five and December seven five. After ten o'clock, various firms tended to sell, and exchange rates weakened accordingly. The price broke through sixty taels and fell by four taels to fifty-seven taels two or three cents by eleven o'clock. Shortly afterward, some buyers returned, raising the price by more than one tael to fifty-eight taels eight or nine cents. The price then retreated to fifty-seven taels seven cents. At noon, the price rebounded from fifty-eight taels four cents, and the closing price remained at 611 taels and forty cents. The adjustment was 50 taels, down to fifty-three or four taels.</p>
<p>The evening session closed at fifty-two taels eight. The market opened at fifty-eight taels, followed by slight fluctuations of two or three cents. Then the price rose from fifty-seven taels seven or eight cents to eight taels four or five cents. There were no large transactions in the market. At three o'clock, the waves suddenly rose, surging tremendously. This was due to the loosening of bills of exchange. Japanese gold for December was bought by Korea for one tael two cents two point five. Furthermore, banks made interbank deals for October British gold at six eight seven five. Sumitomo bought Dalian gold for October at one tael two cents one point seven five. Moreover, Zhifeng, Yongyong Kangyuan, Cheng, etc., eagerly sold. Exchange rates were expected to decrease, and silver bars were also expected to fall. Additionally, Japanese commercial banks tended to sell bars, and news of the expanding Japanese political turmoil spread. People were extremely panicked, and the market showed a tendency to plummet. The price plummeted by more than five taels. Around four o'clock, it suddenly reached fifty-three taels. The price then rose by more than one tael to fifty-four taels seven or eight cents. However, the sellers continued to sell tirelessly, making it impossible for the price to stabilize. The market closed at 4:30 PM at fifty-two taels eight cents, a drastic drop of nine taels and nine cents compared to the previous day. Therefore, trading also doubled in both the morning and afternoon sessions as usual. The highest price of the day was sixty-three taels at the opening in the morning, and the lowest price was fifty-two taels eight cents at the closing in the evening, a difference of ten taels and two cents.

Most Chinese speculators were selling. Guangbang Shen Da, etc., sold more than 100,000 pounds of British gold. Although bank purchases were not weak, they were not agile.

<p>Guangdong Coins Repeatedly Hit New Highs</p>
<p>Market Overview: For all commodities, once there is a strong demand, if the supplier cannot meet it to the fullest extent, they will inevitably raise prices to make a profit. This is a natural phenomenon. The same applies to the sluggishness of the currency system. Therefore, although the market price of copper coins has not risen dramatically, its steady upward trend has been clearly visible to us.

External purchases still amounted to over 100,000 jiao, with transactions totaling 175,000 jiao in the morning market and 90,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper cash suddenly contracted by 4,000 wen to 385,000 wen.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Yarn and Cotton Market Decline Not Weak <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the decline is severe. This is due to the increasing volume of spot yarn at the bottom, and sales in various markets are sluggish. The Guangdong gang bought goods the day before, but now they see that the overall situation is not good, and they are continuously cutting their purchases. At the same time, the pressure from the Chaozhou gang is increasing. However, the bulls of some manufacturers are still calm. The yarn market is indeed affected by the global situation, so it is difficult to support the building alone.</p>
<p>Near-term domestic marks and foreign marks both fell. At the opening of the domestic mark market, prices for American cotton turned down, and retail investors sold unanimously. The market sentiment was particularly loose, and prices fell steadily. Each month fell by 9 cents to 1 tael 12 cents. In the afternoon, many bulls cut their positions, and each month fell by another 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 25,050 bales. Check the sales: Rui Da 1,900 bales, Da Chang Cheng 2,600 bales, Yongfeng 1,900 bales, Hanfeng 1,200 bales, Xiesheng 800 bales, Yukang 800 bales, Gengfeng 800 bales, and others 300 to 450 bales.

<p>The cotton market turned down, actually because American cotton fell again, and the weather cleared, causing people to tire and sell more actively. Daily changes were very fast, making it difficult to grasp. However, currently there are many people who are temporarily bullish based on high psychological expectations, so the market is relatively firm. Hengde Hao purchased about 20,000 to 30,000 dan on behalf of Wuxi merchants, but Rui Da sold 20,000 dan. The cotton market is still pessimistic in terms of its actual position. Because various factories have purchased enough Indian cotton, Chinese and foreign yarn factories have no activity. It is said that 24 Indian cotton yarn factories have stopped work, and there is a surplus of raw materials, so there may be changes in the future. Shenxin purchased 1,000 bales of Rangoon cotton at 23 yen, which will be shipped to the factory immediately.</p>
<p>Han Mark Turns Down Three Cents: At the opening of the Han Mark market, prices were greatly weakened due to the decline in American cotton. However, Hengde Hao took the opportunity to purchase 10,000 dan, and the market situation rose slightly. Each had a drop of two or three cents. In the afternoon, each month rose or fell by five cents. Check the sales: Rui Da 8,000 dan, Shen Ji 2,600 dan, Tongxing 1,500 dan, Yongri 1,000 dan, Xiesheng 1,100 dan, Yongfeng 1,600 dan, Gengfeng 2,700 dan, Gongtai 1,600 dan, and others 1,000 to 1,200 dan.

<h3 id="e196">Grain River Below Rice Market Firm and Weak Mixed <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>North Gate: Yesterday, fewer than ten rice boats were seen on the river below, and trucks arrived continuously. Sales in the market were still good. Due to the sunny weather, people in the North Gang were slightly less enthusiastic about the broken japonica rice, and the market situation was slightly weaker. High-quality goods were still valued at zero yuan six jiao, and top-quality goods were rare, at around zero yuan eight jiao. Although medium-grade goods were not thick, the price was slightly lower. New japonica rice from Xixin was not seen yet, but it was heard that two or three boats would arrive in the market today. The source of new japonica rice from Dongxin was very scarce. Most industries were hoarding and selling at a premium, so the price soared by half a yuan to one yuan, reaching as high as eighteen yuan and a half to eighteen yuan. New Yangjian shipments were slightly soft by more than two jiao. Ordinary goods opened at fifteen yuan, but the morning market traded at fifteen yuan two jiao, then immediately fell back. The situation was ordinary. New Kejian's arrival was very lively, but sales in the market were slightly sluggish due to the sunny weather, and the price opened at fourteen yuan, which was one or two jiao lower than the previous day. Bai Yuan's arrival and sales were evenly matched, and the market situation was similar to the previous day. High-quality goods were priced at eighteen yuan eight jiao.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: The river arrivals were sparse, and sales on this street were particularly active. Unfortunately, the inventory of each type of goods was exhausted. Therefore, after the drastic increase in the price of white broken japonica rice from the Su-Tong gang, it failed to fall yesterday. High-quality goods were still around twenty yuan, and Zhongguan barely opened at nineteen yuan five or six jiao. The situation was no less than the previous day. For now, it is temporarily stable. Fortunately, there are no Chang gang goods arriving here. The source of thin early rice from the South Gang was also scarce, with high-quality goods at twenty yuan eight jiao. Purchasing activity was normal. The goods arriving in Shanghai from New Yangjian were not very prosperous, and sales were slightly weak. High-quality goods here were around fourteen yuan and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e197">More Customer Xian Rice Arrives, Prices Rise <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of various early season rices, especially foreign rice, was floating in the market, and early inventories had been sold out. The remaining hoarded goods and a small number of unsold rice were not easily sold, so the market turned stiff. The price of Zhongguan goods from Jiangxi Ji Zaosheng rose by nearly a jiao again. However, the customer gangs were all watching, and only this street was buying. The number of transactions was actually less than the previous day. A total of 700 bags of Jiangxi Ji Zao Sheng were sold at a price of twelve yuan nine jiao to twelve yuan eight jiao, 300 bags of Hunan rice were sold at a price of eleven yuan nine jiao, and 200 bags of Jiangxi Zao Cao Mi were sold at a price of ten yuan zero nine jiao. The remaining arrivals and sales were lacking.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Afternoon Flour Market Slumps <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Lifting of Ban Dulls Market; Factories Place Orders. Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the prices of various months showed signs of firming up. This was due to rumors that Tianjin was in urgent need of military supplies and was relying heavily on Shanghai flour for support. Shanghai factories, for various reasons, were also hoping that the ban on flour transport would be lifted soon. It was believed that the ban would be lifted in a few days, which led to expectations of increased demand and higher prices, hence the slight upward trend in the morning. However, by the afternoon,</p>
<p>the possibility of lifting the ban became uncertain again. Furthermore, there were rumors that factories had already placed orders for foreign wheat at around 5 taels per Shanghai tael. As a result, the market not only failed to rise but also declined, with prices for various months trending downward. Although the Tianjin route has been opened, the market may see a temporary rebound, but in reality, this will mainly benefit the factories' production. The settlement prices for this month remained unchanged, October decreased by 0.005 taels, November decreased by 0.0125 taels, December and January decreased by 0.0075 taels, and February decreased by 0.005 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Distant Futures Wheat Market Weakens <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the futures wheat market, prices for various months showed a trend of near-term weakness and distant-term strength in both the morning and afternoon trading sessions. The current month's price increased due to some short covering, which boosted market sentiment. Distant months' prices, however, weakened due to foreign wheat quotes being lower by 0.2, 0.3, or 0.4 taels, and also because factories had already started placing orders for foreign wheat at favorable prices, with the option to choose better quality goods. Yesterday, a telegraph from a foreign firm quoted No. 2 wheat at around 5 taels per Shanghai tael, leading to further orders. As a result, distant months' prices weakened again. The settlement price for the current month was 0.04 taels higher than the previous day, October was 0.01 taels higher, November was 0.01 taels lower, December was 0.02 taels lower, January was 0.04 taels lower, and February was 0.02 taels lower. The spot wheat market remained sluggish, with factories showing no inclination to aggressively increase purchases. Opening prices were 0.01 or 0.02 taels lower. Over 2,000 bags of wheat from Shandong, Haizhou, and Haimen were offered, with Shen Da buying over 1,000 bags, and the rest remaining unassigned.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Sugar Market: Domestic Sugar Suddenly Rises <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market reports from producing areas indicated that the current price of Cuban raw sugar remained at 1.125, and the New York futures price for September was 1.08, unchanged from the previous report. The December price was 1.16, and the March price next year was 1.285, with May at 1.37, each rising by 0.01. The current price of Java raw sugar remained at 0.875, and the futures price for September was 0.850, February was 0.825, and November was 0.8125, each decreasing by 0.0125 to 0.025. At the local Chamber of Commerce market, the buying interest in Dutch No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar remained weak. The asking price was 8 taels, but buyers were only willing to pay 7.9 taels. Sellers were unwilling to sell at a loss, leading to a stalemate and a dull market atmosphere with no transactions. Finely ground white sugar was priced at 8.12 taels, and No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was priced at 7.65 taels, with trading also sluggish. There was even less interest in Dutch brown sugar. Domestic sugar saw a slight increase in price due to the temporary improvement in sentiment after the Minghua factory stopped production and demand showed a slight increase. The transaction price for "Mack" brand was 8.125 taels, "ET" brand was 8.1 taels, "ER" brand was 8.2 taels, "YT" brand was 8.075 taels, and "YP" brand was 8.15 taels. Trading was relatively active, and the market showed signs of strength.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Silk and Tea: White Silk Sales to Europe Sluggish <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firms' silk market continued to be weak. European and American markets were selling Japanese silk at low prices, while factory purchases remained sluggish. Shanghai white silk factories complained that the prices were too high and did not purchase. Yesterday, only Shen Yu and others purchased 15 bales of Shanghai white silk, and Zhonghe purchased 10 bales of white dried silk, both at flat prices.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Road Tea Firms See Brisk Sales of Fine Green Tea <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the firms dealing in tea from inland routes, such as Zhen Shou, Luyongxing, Tianxiang, and Tongfu, showed strong interest in purchasing green tea bricks. Sales were similar to the previous few days. There were no large transactions in needle tea or pearl tea. No one inquired about Qining black tea. However, Tianxiang Foreign Firm purchased over 200 boxes of Yichang black tea at a price of 70 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Piece Goods: Water Wave Velvet Stores See Robust Business <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Eastern goods, having risen excessively, are not selling well. The piece goods market saw the end of the price surge yesterday, with actual sales declining sharply. This is mainly because fine broadcloth, Yuan Zhigong satin, Zhigong satin, and Yuehua velvet have all reached extremely high prices, making it difficult for customers to purchase. Furthermore, previous low-priced goods have not yet been sold off, leading to a long-term sluggishness in the market. Yesterday, only the water wave velvet stores saw brisk business. Fumeiren was sold at 0.0225 taels, Foreign Meiren at 0.023 taels, Double Dog at 0.0215 taels, Banana Leaf Title Book at 0.021 taels, and Ship Meiren Yuxian Tu were all sold out at 0.02075 taels, showing a unique prosperity. Since the price increase, many inferior brands of Yuan Zhigong satin have arrived in Shanghai, but the No. 1 brand remains out of stock. Magpie Bridge declined by 0.025 taels yesterday, and Yuehua velvet sales were very sluggish, with very few transactions in the market yesterday.</p>

<p>Hede Road Chinese Buddhist Association declares that the association's newsletter was originally published on a regular basis, one issue per month. However, it has stopped publication since December last year, which has caused great anticipation among Buddhist monks and groups in general. In view of this, the association has decided to continue publishing, but because the delay has been eight months, it is impossible to make up for it month by month in the near future, and it is unwilling to extend it for a long time, so that there will never be a connection with the originally scheduled publication date. It has now been agreed to use an expedient method to combine the fifth and sixth issues of this newspaper into one issue, and to merge the seventh, eighth, and ninth issues into one publication. However, the content and materials will not be superficial due to the combined publication, and will still be no different from the three single-printed publications.

<h3 id="e224">Dysentery Must Not Be Treated with Opium <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Zhongmou</p>
<p>It is now late autumn, and the summer heat that was dormant in the summer has mostly broken out, whether it is autumn fever, malaria, or dysentery. Although the symptoms are different, the cause is the same. My teacher Xie Liheng (located in Ningkang Lane, North Zhejiang Road) is regarded by the medical community as an expert in treating autumn fever and latent evil, and has a unique understanding of treating dysentery. He often said that although dysentery is a serious disease, as long as the procedures are not disrupted, it is not difficult to achieve results within a time limit. The so-called procedures are: it is appropriate to unblock at the beginning, then to harmonize, then to clear, and finally to supplement. Treatment can be restored in order, but there are patients who seek quick recovery or prevent exhaustion and difficulty in support, and smoke opium to relieve temporary suffering, which often leads to prolonged and incurable cases. Therefore, this disease is mostly caused by summer dampness accumulating in the intestinal bend. The more accumulation, the more severe the pain. Only by removing the dirt and unblocking the accumulation can the disease be eliminated and the dysentery will naturally stop. If you take opium to astringe the toxic evil, it will be more imprisoned in the intestines, which is no different from recognizing thieves as sons and raising thieves behind closed doors. Doctors use medicine to expel it, and patients use smoke to keep it. Expelling and keeping each other contradict each other, then the toxic accumulation will not go away, and the intestinal wall will be more easily corrupted. Moreover, dysentery belongs to the summer heat. If the medicine is used to scour the yin early, it will be damaged, and then opium will be used to dry it, then the diet will not be compliant and it will turn into aphonia, which is also incurable. Although opium is a poisonous substance, it cannot be used to treat diseases alone. It is absolutely opposed to dysentery (there are also a few cases where opium poppy shells are used for long-term deficiency), so opium addicts are most dangerous when they suffer from dysentery. Therefore, seeing ordinary people suffering from dysentery and smoking to seek temporary peace, there is no one who does not bitterly advise against it. This is the experience of Master Xie for decades, so treating dysentery often has miraculous effects. This year, there are many cases of dysentery alone, regretting the lack of common sense in the vulgar, so I wrote this to inform the patients.</p>

<p>Twelve people nationwide with annual income of over one million yuan</p>
<p>Osaka News According to a survey by the Japanese tax authorities, due to the sluggishness of commerce and industry, the determined amount of income of various operators this year has generally decreased. However, the highest-level high-income earners have increased compared with the previous year, that is, Mr. Mitsui Hachiroemon, whose income was about 2.8 million yuan last year and who is the only high-income earner in Japan, has not changed much this year and still maintains the top position in the country at around 2.8 million yuan. Mr. Iwasaki Hisaya, who ranked second with an income of about 2 million yuan in the previous year, still ranks second with an increase in income from dividend distribution of about 2.4 million yuan. The former's income tax is 740,000 yuan and the latter's is 620,000 yuan. The third is Mr. Iwasaki Komiyata with about 1.56 million yuan. In addition, there are ten other members of the same clan, Iwasaki Yata and Okura Kihachiro, Hattori Kintaro, Mitsui Genyuemon, Mitsui Motonosuke, Mitsui Takakiyo, Mitsui Takatoshi, and Mitsui Jutaro, who have been determined to be the high-income earners in Kanto, Japan, with more than one million yuan.
