<h3 id="c6">世界航空事業之猛晋 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>航空之術。日益進步。航空事業自亦因之而日益發達。據昨日外電所稱。美國飛行家傑沃兩氏。在天空繼續飛行。有二十六日有餘。始行降落。實破世界繼續飛行之紀錄。又如今日外電所記。英國愛爾一百號與一百零一號飛船。試飛若干次之後。英國政府將在英之迦定頓。加拿大之共特里。與美之紐約間。將設立定期航行事業。又如前次德國之飛船。飛渡大西洋之後。頗受世界各國之注意而歡迎。又如中德航空合同。旣經成立。其路綫一由滬至津平。過满洲里經西比利亞而至歐洲。二由滬過南京津平庫倫。經西比利亞而至歐洲。三由滬過南京。新疆甘肅經西比利亞而至歐洲。其外在歐洲已有之航空事業。更可勿論矣。</p>
<p>不特商業之航空如是。即於軍事各國亦甚重視而猛晋。即如日本。此次因縮减海軍協約成立之後。國中羣起國防不足之議。而其謀唯一補救之法。亦以航空軍爲第一要務。然則今後世界對於航空之注意而競進。豈有减於以前海上之輪艦哉。</p>

<p>汽車新聞專論行路難新車律之補救法  吉人　　近年汽車貨車與長途車。往來道上。爲數日增。而汽車肇禍事端。亦案件日多。上海車輛。爲全國冠。車務管理。亦最複雜。本埠英法華各界之車務處。有鑒於此。對於路上行人之往來與車輛之行動。頗加注意。今熱閙路口。均裝用紅綠警燈。以作嚮導。法至妙焉。　　歐美各國。情形相同。路上行人不能自由行動。均須服從車務警察與警燈之指揮。禁止横衝直撞與徘徊街心。如有犯者。加以警告或處科罰。　　美國通用汽車製造總廠上海分行經理克利時氏。對於車務章程。素有研究。據克氏之意見。本埠亦應採取美國之行路新章。其法甚簡。即在路口道旁。派駐車務警察。巡查行人之行動。手持車務新章小册。詳載行路規程。遇有違章之男女。給以一册。略爲解說。並加警告。對於不聽警士之指揮與警燈之記號者。或亂衝街道者。召回原處。給以車律一册。當塲加以警戒。熱閙路口。另派特别車警巡警駐察。協助指揮。　　行路章程實行後。大都行人均受束縛。頗覺不满。此種情形。理所必然。因向來路人行走自由。無須顧忌。今一旦受此拘束。定感不便。然於車務管理方面。效騐甚大。肇禍事端。亦可大爲減少。　　行人雖加拘束。車輛亦宜時加檢察。各車制。車燈。喇叭。駕駛齒輪與風窗刷等。若機械有缺點者。不准通行。以免肇禍。　　今世界各國漸知車務車務章程。確爲公衆利益計設。此項新車律。不但爲車主之便利。且爲行人之安全。蓋有時車主即行人。行人有時亦車主。彼此相關。皆宜留神。庶使駕駛與行走兩全。此行路新章之目的也。破天荒之道奇試車  志政　　由極危峭之山道馳下　　道奇兄弟公司近爲試騐其單片車身之轎車起見。特舉行一空前偉大之驚人表演。同時並攝製有聲電影。其經過盛况。試爲本年各地汽展中之所僅見者也。　　試騐之方法。即將該車自一極危峭之山道上。直馳而下。動心駭目。數千觀衆。咸爲之失色。經過此番試騐之結果。道奇車之底·盤·骨架·輪軸。均可確切證明其堅固耐用矣。此次表演。計共三次之多。初以佈置未周中途幾至傾覆。幸以司機人之機警。得未肇禍。然易以他車者。其危險當不堪設想矣。第二度試車。將道途修竣。乃直馳而下。其行絶速。惟中途震動極大。亦頗爲觀衆所担憂。第最後終安然降地。甫抵地。即由工程師前來檢騐。察其内中各部。無一不保持其原有之佳况。於是衆皆鼓掌。　　最後一次。成績更佳。惟以速設過捷。至山下時。窗門皆受劇烈之震動。引擎亦受影響。汽車界有史以來。此種偉大之冒險試騐。實爲破天荒所僅見也。檢結視束。一窗之玻璃全碎。坐墊亦有翻亂者。惟内部門窗玻璃。均未損傷。故工程師之報告曰。道奇車者。實一不壞車也。　　道奇車旣全爲金屬製成。故保護車内乘客之安全。較之普通實遠過之。經此試騐。其理益明矣。此車全身。由四部金屬膠合而成一片。此豎强不壞之原來也。故今後汽車界中。將羣繼起爲全金屬車身。至道奇所攝之有聲電影。日來已在美國各大戲院公映。以昭示各界矣。譯叢司蒂倍克要聞彙報  沛甘　　SPA公司之新組　SPA貨車公司組織伊始。專製及推銷司蒂倍克及穿箭牌之貨車。公共汽車。送殯車。救護車及其他商用運輸汽車等。司蒂倍克公司總理歐司金氏。任SPA貨車公司總理職。克利萊氏爲副總理。倫夫爲會計。考透秘書。達爾登查賬員。温德萊副銷售經理。鮑爾登及卡司納爲銷售經理。各種貨車及商用汽車現已由SPA公司總工程師賽奇計劃從事製造。賽氏爲司蒂倍克及穿箭牌貨車工程師之領袖。嘗造世間著名之運貨車多種。有聲於汽車製造界。司蒂倍克及穿箭牌貨車久佔商用車中之重要地位。雖此種事業不過製造客車外之一種副業耳。新公司旣有司蒂倍克及穿箭爲之背助。今後其領袖人出其全力以製造完美之商用運貨車可以斷言。此種貨車又爲一九三零年及一九三一年所特需者也　　新車中裝無線電機　司蒂倍克八缸總統牌及八缸司令牌。其轎車中可裝無線電收音機無線電之天線藏於車項之中。甚爲巧妙。導入線亦同樣隱藏。其接連天線者由車身左前柱引入車盤板。收音機即與此線相接觸。對於此次可收電浪之車項。製造上非常精密。每根電線均各自隔絶。凡金屬與金屬相接觸之處。亦用厚橡皮包裏隔絶。車項之金屬支架及車身四迫之鋼架等。均有同樣之保護以求萬全。　　司蒂倍克零訊一束　（一）久執世界牛耳之司蒂倍克八缸總統牌汽車近又獲得歐洲道路之新紀錄。緣有西班牙運動家拉斐爾倍奇者駕一總統牌車自白雪羅納至麥特烈地方。費時祇七小時又十二分鐘。較之前此紀錄减去三十分鐘。總統牌車均平每小時行五十五英里。　（二）司蒂倍克車製造時。各種機械毫髮不差。凡一千六百十次之機器動作其相差不得過千分之一英寸之一。四百十五次者不得過千分之一英寸之半。　（三）菲列濱島近日銷售大宗之司蒂倍克汽車。馬尼拉之司蒂倍克經售商嘗以十五輕之狄克推多牌汽車售於出租汽車公司。其代價爲三四·五○○菲列濱披索。　（四）司蒂克六缸轎車。近在加利福尼亞之白爾台山爬升七十英里彎曲之路。費時十分鐘又四十四秒鐘。得到巴馬那奬品。　（五）加拿大太陽保險公司經理惠力士語人曰。「余於一九一零年購第一輛之汽車。其後余共有汽車十七輛。七輛屬於司蒂倍克牌子」。　（六）司蒂倍克廠每年造車所用木料逾一八·五○○·○○○尺。其中有堅硬之槐木。硬槭木。北部軟榆。黄松及白松等。　（七）司蒂倍克車引擎中止端之橡皮鑲嵌。足以阻止引擎之震動傳及車身及車架。另外能使全車感得平穩安適之妙。　（八）據司蒂倍克可靠之統計。一九二九年與二九二八年合衆國新車註册統計。一千元以上八缸車增加百分之四十七。同價六汽缸者减少百分之十九。　（九）司蒂倍克一○○·○○○英里俱樂部。係一千輛司蒂倍克車主所組織。久用不敝。近日其全部所行里程約近一五○·○○○·○○○英里。消息德法意三國路政珍聞  悟非　　世界交通最發達之邦。當以歐美諸國爲最。以與吾遠東比。實覺瞑乎其後。然而歐美諸國尚在力求交通之發展。以期文化貨物之益臻灌輸。蓋路政之於交通。猶</p>
<p>Page 30</p>
<p>人身之於血脈。血脈固不可有一秒鐘之停滯。而交通亦豈可有一日之間斷。血脈愈流通。則人身愈健全。路政愈發達。則交通愈迅速。此歐美諸邦所以尚不以現在之路政爲满。而愈思開闢興築。擴展路綫。近更注意路面之舖設。以期其益便於社會人民也。而求道路之堅固久遠也。茲姑以在歐洲者德法意三國。錄之如次。　　德國　關於工程與等欵之計劃。自一九二五年來已經擬定。其工程之内容。爲整理路面·放寛路綫·改築溝道·改移不醒目之路綫。以應時代交通之需要。期於四年之短期内。完成勉敷交通需要之道路綫網。繕修路面。對於柏油瀝青。多冷用法。大概德國各帮省。修築公路計六○·八六六公里。内高等路面即大石方塊及小方石塊路面·大石子路面·混凝土路面·瀝青柏油路面之厚途六公分者四·二六五公里。中等及簡單路面。即灌塡及淺舖柏油瀝青·及柏油砂與瀝青砂路等一七·○八六公里。其餘三九·五一五公里。則用舊法修繕者。除此以外。德國各公路。於固加路面之外。又有種種適應代近高速交通之設施。如改小灣道之灣度。並爲向一面傾斜。改璋陡峻之坡度。廢除狹窄危險之路段。建築繞越道路等。計各邦省在一九二六年至一九二九年間。用於道路新工之經費共一一八兆金馬克。又於一九二六年至一九六年三年度中用於修繕路面改良路線之經費。共二一二·九七九·○○○馬克·最近舉辦之關於路政工程。一爲河上之大橋。一爲邦道繞越線之一段新路。其關於號誌方面。三角號牌之指示危險地點。而其圖形藉反光作用。夜間亦可望見者。故德國交通部與鐵道部管理局。現在研究由列車發出射閃光。以避免與公路上車輛相撞之法。此德國對於路政最近之消息也。　　法國　據巴黎第六次全國工務會議報告書中謂於汽車道僅適用於大中心點。其交通擁擠情形。對於安全與經濟上有危險者。如令汽車通行於普通道路過於普遍。則於汽車交通將全其剌激性與效用。觀此則在法人之意見。以爲改築交通幹路爲汽車道路。即可充分應付各種需要矣。惟聞某工程師曾計劃將聨絡各風景名勝地方。接道避署處所。並爲求食料與貨物之易腐壞者。輸入法京巴黎之迅速計。建築費按寛度二五公尺計算估計每公里約華幣二十萬元。全路共長二○○公里。且路綫經過八縣。共有汽車三○○·○○○輛之多。則此路之建築經濟與否。亦一疑問也。至法國之築路機關。亦以表面澆舖柏油·瀝青等爲改良石子路之要設施。其改築堅厚路面。僅以經濟上較他種辦法更適宜爲限。故其言曰。表面澆舖之利益。爲柏油流動較易。易於滲透。瀝青乳之長處。爲隨時可以澆舖。且澆舖後即可開放交通。又以瀝青乳製造遍全國。可省運費。可省工程也。再法國建築混凝土路進行頗緩。截至一九二八年底止。此種道路之總面積爲五○○·○○○平方公尺。且用濕混凝土建築之各段。與用乾混凝土建築者較爲耐久。此蓋法一九二四年以後。試騐建築混凝土路所得之結果耳。　　意國　意國有最大之二汽車路。一在起於羅馬市外之附近。與雙軌電氣鐵路並行。一爲外國旅客公共游覽之汽車路。據云是路行於山嶺重疊之間。如坡度高大則剷平之。一般論者以爲此種施設。與汽車路之性質大不相宜。蓋汽車之上坡能力頗大。故汽車路之坡度不妨從大。且因此可節省油料。而在延長之直線路段内之陡坡。又可使汽車司機人之移撥機件。而提醒其注意力也。該路之建築方式。係以火山石質之粗石子爲基礎。上舖細石子而滾壓之。再舖混凝土一層。中央厚一八公分。路邊横坡度百分之一·七。作人字形。上澆柏油石屑厚二—三公分。寛一公尺之側徑。一部分以塗白色之混凝士條包嵌、伸縮縮每隔十公尺各設一條。與路中線成六零之角度。建築極堅固也。故乘車輛往來於此路上時。所經之處。或爲繁榮之鄉村。或爲黍麥青青之原野。且噴雲吐霧之火土。又復歷歷在目。沿途風景洵令人心曠神怡。較諸乘火車往來所領略之佳趣。以故游之者衆。而外國旅客之或乘自用汽車。或公共游覽汽車者。長驅疾馳。不絶於是路也。三週間之汽車肇禍記  三原　　日期　　　地址　　　汽車號碼　受傷人　　傷勢　　　最後情形　　七月卅日　華德路　　九四六三　蔣如雲　　頭部重傷　醫治無效身死　　卅一日　　中興路　　運貨汽車　金玉如　　足部輕傷　自投醫院求治　　八月一日　小沙渡路　同右　　　李馮氏　　重傷身死　車主出洋四十元了事　　又　　　　北四川路　七八六八　日人　　　手臂碾斷　送福民醫院　　三日　　　北京路　　某號　　　江北小孩　足部微傷　送院醫治　　五日　　　共和路　　三零一七　吳姓男孩　重傷身死　將車夫拘辦　　七日　　　滬太路　　四三一二　張姓女孩　重傷身死　聽候查辦　　十一日　　龍華路　　運貨汽車　火車　　　壞車頭尾　將汽車夫拘辦　　十三日　　南京路　　二五七八　陸連嶠　　重傷身死　着向法院起訴　　十五日　　霞飛路　　某號　　　張姓女子　重傷身死　和解了事　　十七日　　民國路　　運貨汽車　姜妙生　　足部微傷　自投醫院求治　　十八日　　北京路　　脚踏汽車　吳梅筠　　足部受傷　同上　　十九日　　愛多亞路　某號　　　胡廷生　　足部受傷　送院醫治　　最近三週間之汽車肇禍。共有十三起。内因重傷身死者。計男子二人。男孩一名。婦人一名。女孩三名。手足受傷者。計日人一名。男子四人。男孩一名。兩車互撞一起云。</p>

<p>And to the officers and soldiers at the front.</p>
<p>The National Government and the Nanjing Municipal Party Headquarters also sent telegrams.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Executive Committee's telegram reads: Commander-in-Chief Chiang, and to all the officers and soldiers at the front, after reading your telegram, we are delighted to learn that the national army, through the meticulous planning of our comrades and the brave fighting of all officers and soldiers, has achieved successive victories in just a few days on the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways, inflicting heavy damage on the rebellious enemy leaders in Tai'an and then defeating them in Pingyin, Feicheng, Jieshou, Jiazhuang and other places, and finally achieving a major victory in Jinan. The main force of the rebellious Yan has been almost completely annihilated, and the remnants of the rebellious Feng are terrified. The victory in this battle is a victory for the revolutionary forces of the Three Principles of the People over all remaining revolutionary forces, and it is also a victory for the Chinese national will, which seeks peaceful unification, over the imperialist conspiracy to support counter-revolutionary forces in an attempt to invade. The Party and the country are thus secure, and the nation is thus stable. This is all due to the effective planning of our comrades and the dedication of all officers and soldiers. The good news has spread, and the whole country is rejoicing. All officers and soldiers who bravely defeated the enemy this time will be thoroughly investigated and rewarded separately. We also hope that you will take advantage of the victory to sweep away the remaining villains, so as to quickly save the people from the abyss of suffering and restore the country to peace. We eagerly await this. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government's telegram to Chiang reads: Commander-in-Chief Chiang, after reading your telegram, we are delighted to learn of the victory in Jinan, and that the elite of the rebellious Yan has been completely annihilated. We are even more convinced that those who are loyal to the Three Principles of the People are invincible. Since March of last year, the rebellious elements have risen and fallen in cycles, and the rebellion of Yan and Feng is the final combination of all counter-revolutionaries, and it is also an opportunity for the government to eliminate the forces of counter-revolution and achieve lasting peace and stability. Now that Jinan has been captured, we have a strategic advantage. Pursuing the fleeing enemies, the rebellious Yan has no time to recover. How can the rebellious Feng, who obstructs the army and harbors evil intentions, survive alone? Those who are good at being fickle will also lose their support, and will only expose their crimes to the Party and the country, and will be abandoned by the world. Our army will thus cleanse and pacify Yan, Lang, Qing, Qin, and Long, so that the atmosphere of restoration and peaceful unification will appear. This is what the 400 million people expect, and the spirit of our late Premier Sun Yat-sen will surely guide us. The officers and soldiers of all the armies at the front have made great contributions and suffered hardships. We also hope that you will convey our awards and encouragements. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Nanjing Municipal Party Headquarters sent a telegram to Chiang and all armed comrades at the front on the 19th, saying: We have just read the victory telegrams and learned that Tai'an and Jinan have been successively recovered, the main force of the rebellious army has been completely annihilated, the traces of the enemy south of the Yellow River have been eliminated, and the souls of the two rebellious Yan and Feng have been captured. Sweeping away the dens of bandits and annihilating the major villains is just a matter of time. An army with principles will surely win, and the crowd that betrays the Party and the country will surely perish. From now on, we will have a more obvious example. The hearts of the people throughout the country are filled with joy. However, as the summer heat is rising, our armed comrades at the front are working hard to kill the enemy and have successively captured famous cities. Your hard work is commendable, and your loyalty and bravery are admirable. We hereby send a telegram to express our condolences, and we await your triumphant return. (19th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e6">The Rapid Advancement of the World's Aviation Industry <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The art of aviation is progressing day by day, and the aviation industry is also developing day by day as a result. According to yesterday's foreign telegram, American aviators Jerbo and his partner continued to fly in the sky for more than 26 days before landing, breaking the world record for continuous flight. Also, as noted in today's foreign telegram, after several test flights of the British Airship 100 and 101, the British government will establish a regular navigation business between Cardington in England, Contrecoeur in Canada, and New York in the United States. Also, after the German airship flew across the Atlantic last time, it received attention and welcome from countries all over the world. Also, the Sino-German aviation contract has been established. One route runs from Shanghai to Tianjin and Beiping, through Manchuria, Siberia, and to Europe. The second runs from Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Beiping, and Kulun, through Siberia, and to Europe. The third runs from Shanghai, Nanjing, Xinjiang, and Gansu, through Siberia, and to Europe. In addition, the aviation business already in place in Europe can be ignored.</p>
<p>Not only is commercial aviation like this, but in military affairs, various countries also attach great importance to it and make rapid progress. For example, Japan, after the conclusion of the naval reduction treaty, there was a public outcry in the country that national defense was insufficient, and the only remedy was to make the air force the top priority. Then, in the future, will the world's attention and competition for aviation be less than that of naval ships at sea?</p>
<h3 id="e7">Receiving Domestic Important Telegrams <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Intelligence reports that there are about two regiments of Wan Xuancai's old troops stationed in Kaifeng.

Feng ordered armored trains on the Pinghan Line to go to Zhengzhou, and all the cannons and heavy objects were transported to Zhengzhou by train, appearing as if they were retreating to Luoyang.

<p>(Nanjing) The Capital Garrison Headquarters announced military news on the 19th: (1) After the rebellious enemy on the Longhai Line was bravely repelled by our army, enemy corpses were scattered everywhere, and the rebellious army collapsed towards Kaifeng. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue and kill them. The elite of the enemy suffered heavy casualties and no longer had the ability to resist. Feng's entire army had a plan to withdraw to Zhengzhou and Luoyang. It is expected that they will meet in Zhengzhou soon. (2) The remnants of the rebellious enemy on the Longhai Line were shocked after hearing that our army had recovered Jinan. They still tried to attack us, hoping to achieve something. After being severely attacked by our army for days, only a few remnants remained, and they were out of ammunition and food and could not be replenished. They repeatedly tried to escape without success and are now only lurking in their positions with no combat ability. They will be completely annihilated within days. (3) Our air force has been bombing the enemy's positions for days, killing countless enemies. Ji Hongchang and An Shude were both injured in the bombing. An Shude was seriously injured and died immediately. His troops completely collapsed. The enemy troops are now extremely shaken and are in a state of great chaos. (4) Liu Zhennian's army in Jiaodong has advanced towards Boxing and Qingcheng. Liu himself is supervising the battle in Yexian, with morale at its peak, determined to destroy the enemy. They are now working with other friendly forces to cross the river and pursue the remaining enemies, meeting in Tianjin and Beijing. (5) On the Pinghan front, Wang Zhen's rebellious troops and the remnants of Wan Xuancai's troops have been fighting fiercely over occupying defensive positions and collecting supplies. They are now building fortifications and guarding against each other, and will not stop until both sides are badly damaged. (6) According to reports, our army has surrounded the enemy in Yongcheng on all sides. The city is running out of food, and many civilians are being released every day. Huang Xuchu's troops, about three regiments, came from Liuzhou to rescue Yongcheng and arrived in eastern Yongcheng, but were defeated by our army. The remnants fled to Liuzhou. Yongcheng is expected to be taken soon. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e14">Weihaiwei Will Be Managed by a Commissioner <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan designates it as a naval port.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the management of Weihaiwei after its recovery, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, together with the Ministries of Interior, Navy, Transportation, and Finance, held a meeting to review the matter and agreed on three options: (1) If the Central Government decides to immediately make Weihaiwei a naval port after its recovery, all facilities should be handled in accordance with military plans. (2) If, due to diplomatic, financial, or other issues, Weihaiwei cannot be immediately made a naval port after its recovery, then during the transition period, a special commissioner may be appointed by the Central Government to manage it. (3) If the second option is deemed inappropriate in the administrative system, then the only option is to follow the provisions of Article 2, Section 3 of the City Organization Law recently promulgated by the National Government and establish a city directly under the Executive Yuan, striving for simplicity and frugality in personnel organization to facilitate management and development. As for the establishment of a customs office, the allocation of office space, and the management of lighthouses, the review concluded that the establishment of a customs office and the allocation of office space were not a problem. However, the management of lighthouses, if it is made a naval port, should be classified as a military agency, otherwise it should be handled in accordance with the current methods of various ports. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has submitted the results of the above review to the Executive Yuan for review, and it is heard that the Executive Yuan plans to adopt the second option, designating Weihaiwei as a naval port and appointing a commissioner from the Central Government to manage it. After the matter is submitted to the government for decision, it will be promulgated. (10th and 9th Special Telegrams)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) After the Sino-French Industrial Bank closed down, the Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank was established with a capital of 30 million francs. The old government of our country recognized one-third of it and allocated it from the US dollar bonds issued under the German returned indemnity. When the old government invested, it was agreed with the bank that the Chinese government, as a shareholder, could recommend seven people from the 21 directors of the bank, and could designate one person as vice chairman and one person as Chinese general manager, and select one person from the two supervisors of the bank. The above personnel have been successively appointed by the old government and the National Government. In order to exercise shareholder rights and enhance Sino-French relations, it is specially requested that Zhu Chengzhang and Li Chengyi be appointed to replace Li Guangqi and Su Yuchun as directors of the bank, and that Zeng Rongfu be appointed to replace the supervisor, and that Qian Yongming concurrently serve as the vice chairman of the bank in addition to his original position as Chinese general manager.

<p>Zhang Xiangyun's Announcement: The Shandong Guild Hall in Shanghai reorganized in 1928 after the old board of directors stepped down, creating a Provisional Committee. Subsequently, misunderstandings arose between the old members and the Provisional Committee, nearly leading to litigation. Due to concern for fellow provincials, Xiangyun served as a mediator and was fortunate to have both parties understand and resolve the issues peacefully. The general meeting was successfully held, and the formal committee was thus established. Xiangyun was then invited by the Guild Hall to serve as an advisor, handling all diplomatic affairs, purely on a voluntary basis, without using any public funds. This can be reported without fault to all. In 1929, some Shandong natives in Shanghai formed the East Shandong Association, which then became embroiled in a dispute with the Shandong Guild Hall Committee, resulting in litigation. Maintaining peace, Xiangyun dared not involve himself, but his earnest efforts at reconciliation proved futile, leaving Xiangyun unwilling to rashly interfere. As the Guild Hall inevitably incurred expenses due to the litigation, Xiangyun was not involved in any of it. Moreover, Xiangyun has never handled any financial matters of the Guild Hall, fearing misunderstandings. Therefore, this announcement is made to clarify the situation, hoping that fellow provincials, elders, brothers, and sisters will understand.</p>

<p>Hindenburg Declares Neutrality on Party Affairs</p>
<p>Schrecker Releases Steady Claims</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th - The German election campaign is progressing rapidly, with important events occurring daily. Recently, two significant events occurred. One was President Hindenburg's declaration, stating that he does not wish to be involved in any form of party affairs. Currently, there are elements of the National Right Wing organizing a Hindenburg group, calling for support for Hindenburg, hoping to gain public support. Therefore, the President issued this declaration to clarify the truth. The other event was the first speech by General Schrecker, the former German Commander-in-Chief, after becoming a candidate for the National Party. The outside world was quite suspicious of Schrecker's sudden entry into the political arena, suspecting that he harbored ambitions. Therefore, his speech began by declaring that he is already sixty-four years old and has long abandoned political ambitions. He believes that the current situation is critical, and as a citizen, he should do his best to find a solution and promote the development of parliamentary politics. Therefore, he came out to participate in politics to fulfill his duty as a citizen. However, no matter what, he will vigorously oppose all radical solutions because a radical government is like sailing a boat on a course with no definite destination. However, he strongly advocated cooperation with the Social Democratic Party because the demands of millions of workers in that party cannot be ignored. Finally, when discussing several important domestic issues, he expressed extremely steady claims.</p>

However, the "Guwando Daily", known for its well-informed sources, claims that the leaders of both parties support the dictatorship and believe that it is the only way to solve economic and political difficulties today.</p>

<p>Unifying Official Duties</p>
<p>Establishing Regular Aviation</p>
<p>London, 18th - The Colonial Office issued a memorandum on the unification of colonial duties, stating that the principle of unifying colonial duties into one does not rely on the positive changes in the current situation. The committee studying the Colonial Office's personnel system and colonial duties clearly knows that officials serving in unified colonial duties acknowledge the possibility of being transferred from one colony to another during their tenure. After unifying colonial duties, the Colonial Secretary will have great opportunities to assign appropriate people to appropriate positions so that they can develop their experience. However, the so-called unification of duties does not mean that colonial officials will be transferred constantly, making their footprints all over the world. The unification of duties will definitely be of great benefit to the governments of various colonies.</p>
<p>London, 19th - According to the Blue Book issued by the Colonial Office Conference, after the "Flight K-100" and "R-101" have been test-flown several times and accumulated sufficient experience, the government will establish regular aviation services between Gaddington in the UK, Montreal in Canada, and New York in the US. There are approximately three main routes: (1) passing the Farewell Cape at the southern tip of Greenland; (2) passing Newfoundland; (3) passing the Azores Islands. In addition, there is another route, which is through the Faas Islands, Iceland, and the Herzog Bay of Greenland in the North Sea. This is the route currently being investigated by the expedition under the guidance of Hawkins. The Blue Book mentions the US plan to set up a seaplane airport every three hundred nautical miles between New York and the Azores, and between the Azores and Plymouth, to facilitate refueling and repairs.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Public Telegram <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Ji Yu Company representative Yin Tongsheng telegram: Various newspaper offices appreciate that on the day of Xian, in order to expose poverty and corruption in order to rectify the rules and disciplines, the Ministry of Finance's telegram stated that the Qingdao Office of the Shandong Transportation Department transferred the official document of the Transportation Department, roughly stating that it was ordered by the Ministry of Truth to order that Ji Yu Company violated the rules and regulations for the destruction of salt pounds, and secretly unloaded the delivered salt piles without reporting the inspection. It is extremely illegal and has been verified by the envoy, and all should be confiscated to rectify the salt regulations. Upon receiving this, I was shocked and at a loss. After investigation, this case occurred because Chen Chen, the Transportation Envoy, solicited bribes without success and reported to the Ministry in an attempt to vent his anger. I reported and revealed this in a telegram on the day of Geng, and requested that someone be sent to investigate and deal with it to clarify the truth. I did not receive any clear instructions, and severe condemnation was suddenly spread. Merchants encountered this situation and should have swallowed their anger, known the opportunity and retreated, but merchants also followed the teachings of the late Prime Minister, knowing that the people belong to the master, and the party and the country claim the rule of law. The legal rights and interests of the people are violated, and complaints and relief are not excessive. Therefore, I sent a telegram to the Shandong Audit Branch today, requesting that the details of this case be reported in detail to clarify the truth. As for whether the punishment suffered by the company due to being falsely accused can be revoked, it all depends on the grace of God. Merchants only have to wait for orders in fear. However, punishing corruption and greed was originally taught by the late Prime Minister and declared by the government. Merchants have already understood this and have gathered all the evidence of Chen Chen's use of official power, collusion, demanding bribes, and extorting money. On the day of Xian, they personally submitted it to the court and filed a lawsuit. Merchants do not know Chen Chen and have no grievances. There is no need to start a major lawsuit, and reach the world's lesson of resolving matters and appeasing people. It is better to be heartbroken by corruption and arrogance and not allow consideration. I am forced to be here and have nowhere to escape. I hope that the Ministry will not cherish this horse that harms the people, so that it can punish one and warn a hundred, and serve as a warning to the world. If there is any false accusation, I will gladly accept the reverse sitting according to the law to thank the people of the country. This is a telegram for your review. The Ji Yu Company representative Yin Tongsheng kowtows and so on. I think that in the past, most of the cases of people revealing officials' dereliction of duty have ended in a tiger's head and snake's tail. This has created the wrong concept of officials being superior to the people among the general public, and unscrupulous officials can rely on official power to exploit the good people. The corruption of the political image is extremely serious. Tong Sheng is naturally strong and not afraid of the strong. Now, in order to promote the authority of the law, he has specially filed a lawsuit in the Qingdao Local Court where Chen Chen currently resides and committed the crime, revealing everything and vowing to pursue it to the end in order to demonstrate the law and discipline and warn the official evil. This is a telegram for your review. I beg you to advocate justice and do not fail to cut prayers. The Ji Yu Company representative Yin Tongsheng kowtows skillfully.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Central Army Captures Jinan and Crosses the River Northward <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Armies on the Jiaoji Railway Line Meet to Pursue the Enemy</p>
<p>Feng's Army on the Longhai Railway Line Retreats Westward Under Pressure</p>
<p>Express mail from Xuzhou: The Central Army on the Jinpu Railway Line has made rapid progress. It reached Jinan on the 15th. It has been described in the previous letter. Now, according to the front news, Jinan has been completely occupied by the Central Army, and the advance troops have crossed the river northward. The armies on the Jiaoji Railway Line are meeting in Jinan, and Feng's army on the Longhai Railway Line is also retreating westward at the same time. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Details of the Capture of Jinan: After the Jin army lost Tai'an, it had no power to resist. Although it deployed defenses near Jinan in an attempt to make a final struggle, it had already transported the military strength across the river. The Central Army still advanced fiercely from the left, right, and middle routes. On the 14th, the right wing, led by Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai, broke through the Jin army at Dajiankou, 15 miles southeast of Jinan, and had already shaken Jinan. The middle route, led by Chen Cheng and Xia Douyin, advanced to Jiajiazhuang. The Jin army had no resistance. The left wing, led by Yang Shengzhi and the teaching division, flanked the northwest of Jinan, and the army had worries about the return route being cut off, so it had to retreat north in a hurry. At 2:00 PM on the 15th, Jiang and Cai's divisions first copied to Jinan from the right wing, and Chen and Xia's divisions in the middle route also arrived to join forces. Yang's division and the teaching divisions on the left wing had already copied the northwest of Jinan. The city of Jinan fell at that time. The Central Army all reorganized their divisions, cleaned up the remnants of the enemy in the city, and immediately sent troops to bypass the north to block the Yellow River Bridge in Luokou. The materials of the bridge had been dismantled by the Central Government before abandoning Jinan and transported to Bengbu for preservation. After the Jin army arrived in Jinan, they only built a temporary pontoon bridge for transportation. At this time, it was cut off by the Central Army again. The Jin army did not expect the Central Army to capture Jinan so quickly. Most of them did not have time to retreat north. About 10,000 people surrendered to the Central Government and handed over a large number of weapons. Liu Zhi, the commander-in-chief, had already arrived in Tai'an to supervise the army. At this time, he also left the Tai'an station on the 15th evening and went north to Jinan. The order in Jinan was greatly stabilized. However, when the Jin army retreated from the south of Jinan, they greatly damaged the roads. The Zhangxia Bridge was also destroyed. The road is being repaired temporarily. At this time, the remnants of the enemy in Tai'an, Feng Yuxi's troops, were also disarmed by the 15th Army Ma Tengjiao Division, and completely cleaned up. At present, the Central Army is continuing to clean up the remnants of the enemy on the south bank of the Yellow River, and sending troops to pursue the north. The following is an excerpt of the victory from the front received by Xu Xingying: (1) According to the airplane, our army captured Jinan at noon today, and the reverse enemy fled to Hebei. (2) According to the telegram from Commander-in-Chief Liu, our army has indeed occupied the city of Jinan at 2:00 PM today and sent troops to guard the Yellow River Iron Bridge. The enemy in Henan has no way to retreat and can be completely annihilated.</p>
<p>Meeting of Jiaoji Road: The Han Fuju, Liu Zhennian, and Li Yunheng units on the Jiaoji line are also actively advancing westward. Commander-in-Chief Han arrived at Tancheng Station on the 13th to supervise the attack on the enemy at Bailang River. The enemy army collapsed and the Han army pursued the troops. Then, they passed Changle and repaired the road westward along the way. At present, the return route of the Jin army on the Jiaoji line to Jinan has been cut off, and a part of the Jiang Guangnai division has cut off the road line from Boshan. It has withdrawn to the north of the road line and is collapsing to Hebei from the Boxing and Qingcheng areas. The clearing of the Jiaoji line is also very easy. Mr. Jiang Bocheng was ordered to plan military affairs with Han Fuju and also advanced westward with Han.</p>
<p>Longhai Army Advances Westward: The Feng army on the Longhai line, in order to aid the Jin army on the Jinpu line, has repeatedly counterattacked from the left wing, but they were all repelled. On the 14th night, Feng also ordered Song Zheyuan and Ji Hongchang to attack the Central Army's position. The Central Army was prepared and immediately counterattacked. Song and Ji were defeated. At present, the Jin army lost Jinan, and the Feng army collapsed westward overnight. The Central Army took the opportunity to advance and has crossed Minquan Neihuang and directly approached Lanfeng again, killing more than 10,000 enemy officers and soldiers. Now, they are pursuing from the left and right wings. Qiu Wei, the director of the transportation office of the general headquarters, sent a telegram to Xu from the west road yesterday to Director He Yaozu and Transportation Commander Qian Zongze, asking them to quickly prepare materials such as railway tracks, bridges, and electric poles, and transport them to the front overnight to follow the army for repairs and facilitate transportation. It is reported that Feng will implement the plan to abandon Bian and defend Zheng.</p>
<p>Generals Come to Xu: In the midst of the Jinan victory, Yang Jie was summoned by Jiang's telegram and came to Xu from Tai'an on the 15th evening and will go west. Yang met with Mr. He Yaozu in Xu to discuss everything. It was decided to take the same car west that night to report the Jinan situation and plan future military affairs. According to Li Jun, the chief of staff of Yang's fortress headquarters, our army has absolute certainty of winning Jinan. Yang came south from Tai'an this time, took a car to Nan Station, then took a car to Xu from Yan, and then went west with Director He to visit the main seat and plan other important matters. This morning, Ma Hongkui happened to return to Xu from Beijing to visit He Yang and decided to go west with him that night to report his official duties in Qingdao. (16th)</p>
<h3 id="e57">Hubei Provincial Army Begins to Suppress Bandits <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Huayuan Xiaogan Guangshui Area Has Been Cleared</p>
<p>Correspondence from Hankou: Regarding the pacification of Hubei Province, the Wuhan camp has made specific arrangements in military affairs since the confirmation of the plan. Recently, powerful troops have been assembled on the Pinghan Line and the three sides of eastern, western, and southern Hubei to carry out the suppression. The operations began on the 16th. The following is a summary of the recent bandit suppression situation and the situation obtained by aircraft reconnaissance. The Huayuan Xiaogan Guangshui area on the Pinghan Road has many mountains and dense forests, and has always been an area where Communist bandits haunt. At the beginning of this month, a small number of Communist bandits often harassed various townships and towns, and sometimes even scurried to the vicinity of the railway, destroying rails and cutting off wires. Although Liu's regiment stationed in Huayuan of the 3rd Teaching Division repelled them, they were unable to pursue them due to their weak forces. Later, Dai Minquan of the New 25th Division led his troops to Hubei from Henan, and on the 14th and 15th, he joined forces with the 14th Independent Brigade and Liu's regiment to attack in different routes, killing many enemies. However, there are still more than 100 scattered remnants of bandits who are looting people in a certain village 30 miles away from Huayuan Station. They went to encircle and suppress them in the early morning of the 16th, killing more than 20 bandits, and the rest fled to the east. At present, the bandits in the Guangxiao area have been cleared. As for the bandits in Tonghaikou in western Hubei, Chen's camp of Liu's regiment also went to suppress them fiercely yesterday on the 17th, and sent a camp to intercept them by surprise in Pengjiaju. After a battle of about two hours, about 100 bandits were killed, more than a dozen earth guns and countless flags were seized. The bandits fled to Fengkou via Baimiao Makou. Today (18th), the 1st Aviation Team, led by Lu Zhenxian, flew to the Fengkou Mianyang Baimiao area at 5:30 in the morning to conduct reconnaissance in a new T克罗斯 aircraft. It was detected that the inside of Fengkou Village was extremely chaotic, and there were many small boats parked in the river, which seemed to be occupied by bandits. Two 120-pound bombs were dropped, and then the aircraft flew to the villages in Qingshankou Dongyanggang east of Xiaohaxi. There were also bandits stationed, and one bomb was dropped in Qingshankou, and the aircraft was lowered and strafed with machine guns, and another bomb was dropped in Gongjiamu. Tonghaikou, Mianyang, Xiadian, Caidian, Meidian, etc. were very quiet, and no traces of bandits were found. Zhang Yougu of the 1st Aviation Team also flew to the area of Wuxue Tianjiazhen Longpingzhen Huangmei Guangji in eastern Hubei to detect the traces of bandits. Only dozens of small boat bandits were found near Dajinpu, some holding guns, some holding red flags, and some holding knives and spears. A 120-pound bomb was given as a reward, killing more than a dozen bandits. All the large and small roads in the other counties have been carefully detected, and there are no traces of bandits.

<h3 id="e58">Post-Loot Donation in Hunan Province <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Tax on Farmland Rents Ranging from 4% to 16%</p>
<p>Tax on Capital Ranging from 1% to 5%</p>
<p>Tax on Houses Ranging from 8‰ to 14‰</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Hunan Province was ravaged by the Gui Zhang army in the recent two months, and the total loss was no less than tens of millions. However, Changsha only forced a donation of one or two million yuan, and a part of the public property was lost. This time, the Communist bandits attacked Changsha. All the public institutions, buildings, antiques, books, machinery, instruments, specimens, etc. in the whole city were burned, and the churches, schools, private houses were burned or demolished, the big merchants and wealthy households were looted or donated, and the deaths of people and the loss of family displacement were no less than 10,000,000. Changsha, the cultural, political, and commercial center of Hunan Province, which was known for its wealth, is now extremely desolate, and it is no longer as prosperous as it used to be. After the catastrophe, the remaining people are being comforted and gathered, but the suppression of bandits is in progress, and there is an urgent need for military expenses. Therefore, He Jian hired 25 leaders from the gentry and business circles, such as Zuo Xueqian, to form a Military Resources Committee to raise 2 million yuan in military expenses before the end of August. The decision was made to raise funds as follows: (1) Collect two months of rent from the provincial capital, about 200,000 yuan. (2) Each merchant will pay 300,000 yuan. (3) Borrow 500,000 yuan from each merchant with rice passports. (4) Send Shu Lijian to borrow 1,000,000 yuan from the Han business community, using rice passports or ore as collateral. As the number of funds is difficult to raise and the support is urgently needed, 200,000 yuan each from disaster relief funds and education funds were misappropriated to cope with it. The above belongs to the first batch of fundraising methods. As for the second batch of fundraising methods, it has been decided to hold a post-disaster donation to fill the needs of building fortresses, eliminating communist military needs, repairing government offices, developing social undertakings, and relief undertakings. The Military Resources Committee decided to collect eight articles of the post-disaster donation regulations and sent a letter to the provincial government and the four headquarters to comply with them. It is expected that the donation of more than 6,000,000 yuan can be collected within three months. The following is a record of the regulations, which shows the burden of the citizens of Changsha.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Peng Dehuai Flees to Tonggu and Wanzai <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Aircraft Conduct Daily Reconnaissance of Bandit Activity</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: After Zhu De and Mao Zedong captured Shanggao and Yifeng, they engaged in widespread robbery and looting. The former Jiangxi Governor Hu Siyi's ancestral home in Yifeng, a very magnificent residence, has already been destroyed by the communist bandits. Other slightly well-known families have been completely ransacked. At present, the main force of the bandits is fleeing towards Wanzai, while smaller groups are scattering to Xinyu and Yichun counties, causing widespread disturbances. Peng Dehuai's bandit forces have retreated to Tonggu and Wanzai, and will temporarily remain in this area. Their future direction of escape and disruption seems undecided. Since the 14th, Lu Diping, in order to investigate bandit activity, has been dispatching a Moths No. 103 fighter plane daily to various locations for reconnaissance and bombing. The results of the past few days are as follows: (1) On the 14th, early in the morning, Tang Yuhe and Hu Zuqing piloted the Moths aircraft from Nanchang to the Gaoan, Shanggao, and Wanzai areas, distributing tens of thousands of leaflets. According to reports, communist bandits in Gaoan, Shanggao, and Wanzai were greatly panicked upon seeing the aircraft soaring in the sky and scattering leaflets, scattering and fleeing in all directions. (2) The border area between Yujiang and Xingui in eastern Jiangxi, 180 miles from the provincial capital, is a necessary route for the Rao River to reach the province. Since capturing Yiyang, Fang Zhimin's forces have invaded the county. On the morning of the 11th, the county seat and the Huangjinbu area were occupied by Fang's bandits. After receiving the report, Lu Diping, in addition to ordering the Zeng militia to suppress the bandits, specially ordered the Moths aircraft to conduct reconnaissance. On the morning of the 15th, Hu and Tang carried several heavy bombs and bundles of anti-bandit leaflets, flying to Yugan and Yujiang, returning to the province at 10 o'clock. According to their report, when flying to Yujiang, no traces of bandits were seen, but a group of communist bandits was discovered about twenty miles from the city. Two sixty-pound bombs were dropped on the bandit gathering, killing countless bandits, and the remaining bandits scattered. (3) On the morning of the 16th, the aircraft again flew to the Gaoan area for reconnaissance. Several hundred communist bandits were seen about ten miles from Gao City, fleeing in a disheveled manner. Several bombs were dropped, killing many bandits. Currently, the provincial party headquarters, in order to eliminate the communist bandits as soon as possible, has specially appointed Xiong Yuxi, Tian Keming, Yin Jingrang, and Wu Qisheng as four commissioners to go to Beijing and Hankou to petition for the rapid dispatch of a large army to Jiangxi. The four commissioners have set off today. The provincial government previously organized a guerrilla force from the security department, and has now also formally established the third police team and the armored train team of the Nanxun Railway. In the Ji'an area, because most of it has fallen into the bandit-controlled area, extremely strong defensive works, such as new-style trenches, gun emplacements, electric fences, and guard towers, are being gradually completed around the city.

<h3 id="e60">Twenty Communist Bandits Executed by Firing Squad in the Capital <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Plotting to Launch an Uprising in the Capital in Support of the Hunan and Jiangxi Communist Bandits</p>
<p>The Capital Garrison Headquarters signed the order to execute twenty communist bandits by firing squad at Yuhuatai at 3 PM on the 18th. The process of arresting these communist bandits, the announcement of their crimes, and various other circumstances are recorded below.</p>
<p>Process of Arrest: Last month, the Investigation Department of the Capital Garrison Headquarters repeatedly received reports from secret agents that the Communist Party was plotting an uprising in the capital, hoping to respond to the communist bandits in Hunan and Jiangxi, and that many Communist Party members had been sent from Shanghai and Hankou to Beijing to participate in directing the operation. Based on these reports, the department immediately dispatched investigators to intensify the search and arrest. On the 29th of last month, an organization was uncovered on the upper floor of the Meihua Barber Shop in Xiaguan, and key criminals Guo Jintang, Wang Zhongbin, Li Xingguo, Li Yuanhe, Chen Yuhua, Song Ruhai, and others were arrested. A copy of the "Red Vanguard Team" organizational plan and a large package of various Communist Party leaflets, slogans, and printed materials were seized. On the same day, Li Chuankui, Jiang Zongluan, and Feng Bailiu were arrested on Shiba Street, and a large package of various Communist Party declarations, slogans, and printed materials were seized.

<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>The testimonies were deemed conclusive, and all were sentenced to death. In addition, there are several other cases and many suspects involved in those cases that have not yet been clearly investigated. These cases will not be announced for the time being. The twenty individuals sentenced to death, including Ren Xuetao, were brought in yesterday, the 18th, at 3 PM to verify their identities. Led by Adjutant Yuan Yangsheng, a team escorted the prisoners to Yuhuatai, outside of Zhonghua Gate to be executed by firing squad, in order to serve as a warning.</p>
<p>Circumstances at the Time of Execution: After the news of the Garrison Headquarters executing communist bandits by firing squad spread, the area in front of the department, including Dongpailou and the Confucius Temple, was crowded with onlookers from around 2 PM. At 3:15 PM, the criminals were brought out one by one. Military Judge Gu Bisheng used a red pen to mark their tags on the spot, verified their identities, had them drink alcohol and insert the tags, and then tied them into rickshaws. When the bandits were being tied up, they sang "The Internationale" and shouted reactionary slogans, appearing calm and unafraid. They were escorted by the Special Task Force of the headquarters, together with the cavalry of the Capital Police Department. Supervising Officer Yuan Yangsheng rode a horse alongside. Many people watched along the way. At the time of the execution, the bandits stretched their necks and waited, showing no signs of fear. In about fifteen minutes, these twenty Communist Party members returned to the underworld, one by one.</p>
<p>Announcement of Crimes: Regarding the announcement of the crimes, according to the head of the Investigation Department of the headquarters, Tian Jingxing, the following Communist Party members were arrested after uncovering Communist Party organizations in Beijing: Ren Yao, also known as Ren Xusheng (i.e., Ren Xuetao), Tan Jianian (alias Tao Bin, also known as Tao Yiyuan), Guo Jintang (i.e., Guo Hongxun, alias Zhongda), Li Xingguo, Li Weixuan (i.e., Li Gongfang, alias Wang Zhongbin, also alias Zhou Zhiqing), Huang Xiangbin, Song Ruhai, Tang Zao (alias Yang Zaiwen), Fu Linbo (alias Huang Longxian, also known as Chen Zhangjin), Wang Mengxian (alias Wang Housheng), Li Yuanhe, Chen Yuhua, Lei Zhongyun (i.e., Lei Yunong), Shen Yishan, Zhang Yimin (i.e., Zhang Zhengan), Chen Jichang (i.e., Chen Fanbo), Li Chuankui (i.e., Li Qiyu), Jiang Guangluan (i.e., Jiang Zhongyi), Feng Bailiu (i.e., Feng Chunhui), Fang Zhennian (i.e., Fang Zhenlian), and twenty other individuals. In addition, various Communist Party plans and propaganda materials were seized from the residences of these criminals. After separate interrogations by the headquarters, and mutual corroboration, it was confirmed that these twenty individuals, including Ren Yao and Guo Jintang, were indeed important members of the Communist Party. Some had been secretly active in Beijing, while others had come from Shanghai and Hankou to instigate conspiracies. According to the confessions of all the criminals, and various pieces of evidence, they had all been commissioned by the Third International, hoping to deceive the masses, exploit workers and peasants, incite soldiers, collude with bandits, disrupt public security in the capital, and respond to the communist uprisings in Hunan and Jiangxi.

<h3 id="e61">Zhang Xueliang Goes to Beidaihe <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: Zhang Xueliang, Commander of the Northeast Border Defense, is going to Beidaihe to escape the summer heat. This decision had been made before going to Huludao, but after arriving in Huludao, he felt slightly unwell. Because Beidaihe is inhabited by both Chinese and foreigners, and many representatives gather there, it is not conducive to quiet recuperation. In addition, the security in Huludao is tight, unlike the complexity of Beidaihe. Therefore, the temporary decision was canceled. Now that the weather is getting cooler, if it were not for the water obstructions in Beining, he would be returning to the provincial capital. A few days ago, he received an invitation from the commander of the British Navy, whose ships were entering the port in Qinhuangdao, and thus made another trip to Beidaihe. On the morning of the 11th, accompanied by National Government representatives Fang Benren and Zhang Qun and his wife, Ms. Yu Fengzhi, as well as other staff, he arrived in Beidaihe by car. On the afternoon of the 12th, he visited the British Navy warship. That evening, the British Navy commander hosted a banquet for Mr. and Mrs. Zhang. It is heard that Mr. Zhang plans to stay in Beidaihe for a short time before returning to the province to sort out various accumulated military and political affairs of the past month. Currently, Northeast representative Tang Erhe has gone to Beidaihe to meet with Zhang. (14th)</p>
<h3 id="e62">Extremely Severe Flooding in Liaoning <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: Due to continuous heavy rain in Liaoning Province, rivers have overflowed, and countless people's homes, railway tracks, and bridges have been washed away and submerged. The authorities initially hoped to remedy the situation after the weather cleared up, but the weather is unpredictable. After every few days of sunshine, there is a rainstorm. As a result, traffic on all roads is blocked, with water depths reaching seven or eight feet, and transportation is completely interrupted. Repairs are repeatedly washed away. The provincial government has received disaster reports from various places, almost like snowflakes. The telegram from Suizhong County roughly states that in the county on the 3rd and 4th, waterfalls erupted in the mountains, tides rose in the sea, and rivers flooded without anywhere to go. The county seat and streets were completely washed away, with over 3,000 homes in the city and suburbs affected, and 2,000 men and women drowned or swept away. The affected area extends 400-500 li east-west and over 100 li north-south. The county has temporarily set up porridge kitchens to provide relief to the disaster-stricken people, but it is feared that its capacity cannot be extended for long, and its grain reserves are low, making it difficult to sustain. It requests to first draw upon accumulated grain reserves and funds to alleviate the immediate needs, and also requests that personnel be sent to inspect the situation and allocate 1,000 shi of relief grain and 400 tons of lump coal. In addition, more than 1,000 people were drowned in the area west of the Raoyang River over the course of the 12th and 13th. There are still refugees trapped by the water. After verification by the Liaoning Branch of the Red Swastika Society of the World in the provincial capital, it was decided that President Tan Tiehuang should visit Provincial Chairman Zang Shiyi and request that the Transportation Committee be informed by telegram to instruct the Beining Railway to allocate a locomotive, three covered freight cars, and one flatcar to facilitate the society's transport of disaster relief grain. The society purchased 5,000 jin of large flatbreads in the city and suburbs, and also purchased three large wooden boats, which were escorted by the organized temporary relief team to the Baiqibao area of the Raoyang River in Xinmin County for emergency use. It is heard that after arriving in Xinmin, another 1,000 dan of grain will be purchased and distributed. In addition, the river water has surged along the Beining Railway line, and the current is extremely turbulent. Obstructions have occurred successively between Xinmin and Liuhegou on the Ping-Shen main line, between Baiqibao and Raoyang River, between Raoyang River and Dahushan, and at the Nüer River in Jin County. Starting from the 4th of the month, round-trip trains have been suspended. Although the railway authorities are supervising workers to rush repairs, the rain comes again as soon as the repairs are completed, and they are washed away again. The situation in each section is mostly the same, and the resumption of traffic is still far off. The Yingkou and Datong branch lines have also been obstructed due to flooding. It is heard that the total loss of the railway is estimated at 1,560,000 yuan. (14th)</p>
<h3 id="e63">Railway Materials Still Allowed to be Tax-Exempt <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Railways Argues That There Should Be No Restrictions According to the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Contract. The Ministry of Railways previously reported that the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau had stated that the Ministry of Finance had recently declared that the one-year tax exemption for materials of state-owned railways had expired and would not be extended. However, those railways with loan contract relationships should still be granted tax exemption in accordance with the contract provisions. The Ministry of Railways consulted with the Ministry of Finance to handle the matter. The Ministry of Finance replied that the 14th clause of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway loan contract in English only refers to the materials needed for construction, and does not mention materials for train operation and road maintenance. The so-called precedent of the Beiyang Railway should be limited to the materials needed for construction. Now that the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway has long been completed, it is difficult to grant further tax exemption. The Ministry of Railways believes that the 14th clause of the contract clearly states that all materials needed for the construction of the main line and branch lines, whether imported from overseas or transported from other provinces, are exempt from customs duties and likin, according to the precedent of the Beiyang Railway. The stipulation is very clear, and the original text contains the phrase "according to the precedent of the Beiyang Railway." This loan contract was signed in the 29th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. The so-called "precedent of the Beiyang Railway" at that time should refer to the contract of the Dongqing Railway Company in the 22nd year of Guangxu and the traffic contract of the Luhai Railway in the 24th year of Guangxu. Clause 7 of the Dongqing Railway Company contract states that all materials needed by the company for the construction and repair of the railway should be exempt from various taxes and likin. Clause 9 of the Luhai Railway traffic contract states that all materials needed by the company for train operation and road maintenance, when transported from foreign countries, should be exempt from customs duties and likin. According to the provisions of the above two contracts, all materials for construction, repair, train operation, and road maintenance are tax-exempt, with no time limit. The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway contract having declared its reliance on the precedent, it is not appropriate to impose restrictions. The Ministry of Railways has submitted the above reasons to the Executive Yuan for review, and requested that the Ministry of Finance be instructed to continue to handle the matter in accordance with the previous tax exemption methods. It is heard that after receiving the submission, the Executive Yuan has instructed that the original plan be maintained.</p>

<p>The Crime of Extortion by Bandits: Cai Yisheng, a villager in Xihutang Township, Punan, cultivates dozens of acres of farmland. He is diligent and thrifty, and his family can barely make a living. At the beginning of last month, three bandits carrying box-shaped pistols sent a letter demanding 1,000 yuan, to be collected by the 20th. At the same time, Xu Maoxiang, who lived nearby, also received a letter demanding 800 yuan. Xu was timid by nature, and became anxious and ill after receiving the letter, leading to his death. When the due date arrived for Cai Yisheng, three bandits came, around 9 PM. The villagers had already gone to bed. The bandits deceived Cai Yisheng by claiming they needed to borrow a boat, and then seized him and demanded the money. Cai, intimidated by the bandits, immediately scraped together 200 yuan from neighbors. The bandits seemed unsatisfied, but Cai could not raise any more money. They set a deadline of three days for their return and asked Cai to meet them at Nanyang Lou in Shanyang Town for tea. However, the bandits' route of departure was along a small path leading to Shanyang, indicating that an acquaintance must have been involved. The bandits also spoke in a local dialect, providing clues that the authorities should be able to use to apprehend them.</p>
<p>Petition to Relieve Prison Overcrowding: The county prison has three large cells and eight small cells, which can accommodate about 100 people. Recently, due to the increase in criminals, the prison is housing over 180 inmates, and there are also those detained pending trial, not included in that number. As the weather is hot, the cramped conditions can easily lead to disease. To alleviate the overcrowding, Warden Zhang plans to transfer 40 inmates to other prisons. In addition, there are 20 inmates from Shanghai No. 2 Prison being held there. After six are released upon completion of their sentences, there will be 14 remaining, and he has requested that the Shanghai prison take them back. It is heard that a roster has been prepared and submitted to the county government for forwarding to the High Court for approval.</p>

<p>Garrison Headquarters Comes to Suzhou to Escort Key Criminals: The Capital Garrison Headquarters yesterday instructed four soldiers, including Ma Chongxing, to come to Suzhou with official documents to escort two key anti-revolutionary criminals, Li Yuzhe and Ju Shilin, from the High Court. They were taken from the Third Detention Center in the morning and escorted back to Nanjing for further investigation.</p>
<p>Newly Appointed Prison Warden of Fengxian Resigns: In the case of the escape of 58 prisoners from Fengxian County Prison, Chief Judge Lin of the High Court ordered Warden Liu Ou to be investigated by the Shanghai District Court. Miao Wengui was appointed to fill the vacancy. After being appointed, Miao went to Fengxian to investigate the incident. He believed that the prisoners' escape was caused by the incitement of reactionary elements, and not due to Warden Liu's negligence. Therefore, he came to Suzhou yesterday to meet with Chief Judge Lin, explained the situation in detail, and requested that Warden Liu not be held responsible. As for himself, he resigned from the position of prison warden of the county on the spot.</p>
<p>Impersonating a Soldier for Extortion Leads to Arrest and Execution by Firing Squad: The Fourth Regiment of the Suzhou Garrison reported on the 18th that Xu Jinbao, a boatman, reported that Xia Dahua, a native of Dongtai, was wearing a uniform and impersonating a soldier to extort money in the area outside Chanxu Gate. Commander Xuan immediately sent troops to arrest Xia in a small teahouse on the road. As a result of the interrogation with Xu, Xia Dahua confessed that he was 25 years old and admitted to extorting money from the boatman Xu Jinbao and impersonating the regiment. Therefore, at 10:30 AM yesterday, the 19th, the criminal was tied up and executed by firing squad on Liuyuan Road, and his crimes were announced as a warning.</p>
<p>The Details of the Communist Bandit Prison Break in Qidong: Regarding the case of the communist bandits breaking into the Qidong County detention center and setting it on fire on the evening of the 8th of this month, Judicial Commissioner Zhu Zhongqi, appointed by Chief Judge Lin of the High Court, went to investigate the incident in detail on the 14th of this month and reported back to Suzhou yesterday. According to the investigation conducted by Commissioner Zhu this time, the circumstances are as follows: Previously, the county had captured the communist bandit leader Zhao Keming and detained him in the detention center. County Magistrate Xia Yueqing reported the matter to the province, ordering that he be sent to the Songhu Garrison Commander for investigation. The communist bandit comrades learned of the matter and, on the evening of the 8th, gathered more than 300 people, armed with rifles, wooden sticks, broadswords, etc., broke into the detention center from behind by destroying the wall, releasing more than 60 prisoners. More than 30 people were still inside when the bandits set the building on fire. Fortunately, a pirate who had not escaped did his best to extinguish the flames. Subsequently, 50 police officers from the county went to pursue the bandits, who had fled and scattered into the cotton fields in the countryside. The police officers, fearing that they would be surrounded by the bandits, returned to the county to maintain order. After receiving the report, Chief Judge Lin, noting that the fire was extinguished by pirates, ordered the county to be given a lighter punishment.</p>
<p>Lawyer Sues County Magistrate, Investigation to be Sent: Lawyer Zhang Qingyue recently filed a lawsuit with the High Court accusing Liang Zihou, the magistrate of Chongming County, of corruption and harming the people, among other charges. Yesterday, the High Court instructed the chief prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court to send personnel to investigate the allegations clearly before making a decision.</p>

<p>Request to Postpone County Collection of Salt Field Taxes: The elders of the county, Tao Wangkan and others, believe that the county government's plan to collect salt field taxes at the county level in order to combine them with the busy season tax is not in line with local conditions. Therefore, they requested a postponement the day before yesterday. Their reasons are: (1) Salt fields outside the sea dike are called "Dangdi," and the soil is salty and barren, yielding little. Salt fields inside the dike also have shallow ditches, and there is a saying that they yield three harvests every nine years. Therefore, past authorities have always taxed them lightly. (2) Both the inner and outer salt fields are low-lying and require dredging ditches and adding mud every year. During high tides, the reeds and fields are still prone to being washed away. Therefore, these fields cannot be compared to the cultivated land in the county. Now, the county government claims that combining the busy season tax with salt field taxes will increase revenue by 100,000 yuan per year, causing the people to spread the news in alarm and feel insecure. Although this case concerns changes in the administrative system between the county and its field, there will be a decision by the superiors. The people are all paying taxes, so there is no need to dwell on it. However, the principle of increasing taxes should be based on whether they can be borne and should be implemented gradually. It should not be rushed. The people would be grateful if the county could refrain from persisting in its opinion.</p>
<p>Southern Fengxian Joint Defense Approved by Provincial Order: Ding Zhiyan, captain of the county police brigade, previously stated that the border area in southern Fengxian is easily used to hide bandits, making arrest and pursuit difficult. Therefore, he consulted with Zhang Yiyi, the fifth district chief of the county, and obtained his agreement. Now, the Nanhui County sent a letter stating that the fifth district had reported Captain Ding's proposal for joint defense in southern Fengxian. The proposal has been approved by the provincial government. Therefore, County Magistrate Shen has now drafted a joint defense plan for reporting at a meeting. He will also initiate a joint defense conference involving the five counties of Songjiang, Fengxian, Jinshan, Nanhui, and Shanghai to thoroughly eliminate bandits.</p>
<p>The New Heads of the Chambers of Commerce in Nanqiao and Zhuangxing are Declared After Mutual Selection: Regarding the re-election of the chambers of commerce in Zhuangxing and Nanqiao, it is known that the two chambers held mutual elections the day before yesterday.

<p>A Rural Woman in Huacheng Lane Gives Birth to a Monstrous Fetus: In Huacheng Lane, located about three miles from Zhangjingqiao Town in the seventh district of Xiyi (Huai Shang City), there lives a farmer named Chen Yaogen, who is engaged in agriculture and has a modest family fortune. His wife, Zhou, who is 37 years old, became pregnant last winter and carried the pregnancy to term. Yesterday afternoon around 4 p.m., Zhou suddenly felt abdominal pain and knew she was about to give birth. She quickly summoned a midwife to attend to her at home. Shortly after, she gave birth to a monstrous fetus. The child had a white fleshy horn on its head, about three inches long, and its head resembled that of an animal, but its hands and feet were the same as those of a normal child. Mr. and Mrs. Chen were very surprised to see this monstrous child and considered it ominous, planning to abandon it in the wilderness. Those who came to see it were amazed, but the monstrous fetus died about an hour after birth.</p>
<p>Three Bandits from Wujin Recant in Court: Xue Furi, captain of the detective team of the local Public Security Bureau, captured three major suspects in the Wujin kidnapping case, Jiang Jigen, Gong Ahui, and Zhu Jinsheng, at the Railway Hotel the night before last. Two unmailed letters were also found. During the interrogation, Jiang Jigen confessed to one robbery, stating that he and Zhang Agen, a farmer from Outangqiao, and Zhu Jinsheng came to Wuxi to commit a robbery near Meiyuan, which failed, leading to their arrest. Gong Ahui confessed to two robberies, and Zhu Jinsheng confessed to four robberies and kidnappings. It is rumored that the robbery of the Zhou Tieqiao to Wuxi boat was also committed by the above three criminals. Yesterday afternoon, Captain Xue prepared a document and sent them to the bureau. Section member Bao Tiyu of the Third Section opened the court for interrogation. However, Jiang Jigen and the other two suddenly recanted their confessions. After three hours of interrogation, no conclusive confession was obtained. After the interrogation, they were sent to the county government for trial. It is reported that the Wujin County Government will send personnel to Wuxi within a few days to escort them back for trial.</p>
<p>Subsidizing the Long-Distance Telephone Expenses of Nine Counties: The long-distance telephone lines of nine counties in Jiangsu Province are now planned to be expanded, passing through Wujin directly to Suzhou. The Provincial Long-Distance Telephone Administration has made detailed plans. Four-tenths of the entire line project has been completed, but the total project cost is still short of 15,000 yuan. A special request has been submitted to the Construction Department to have the costs shared by the three counties of Wuxi, Xiyi, and Suzhou, and to allocate funds from the original construction funds of each county for advance payment. Once the Financial Department allocates the project funds for the line, the advance payments will be reimbursed. The amount to be shared is determined based on the length of the line: Wuxi 6,000 yuan, Xiyi 6,000 yuan, Suzhou 5,000 yuan, and Wujin 4,000 yuan. The Wuxi County Construction Bureau has been ordered to allocate 6,000 yuan from the collected construction funds and report it to the Construction Department for use.</p>

<p>Regarding the Jinliyuan Wharf Case</p>
<p>Inquiring About the Reasons for the French Court's Continued Hearing</p>
<p>Approaching Steps for Arbitration</p>
<p>Regarding the dispute over the Jinliyuan Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau, the results of the negotiations between Cai Ziping, Acting General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, and Liu Yunfang, Director of the Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and French Consul General Gager, to prevent the French court from executing the ruling and to proceed with arbitration immediately, were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m., Mr. Teipke, the lawyer representing the China Merchants Bureau, suddenly reported to General Manager Cai by telephone that he had received a notice from the French Court of Public Affairs that the case would be re-heard at 3:00 p.m. today (i.e., yesterday) and requested that Teipke appear in court as a representative. General Manager Cai replied that the French Consul had already clearly expressed the day before that the execution of the Public Affairs Office would be prevented. Why was it still necessary to re-hear the case? While asking lawyer Teipke to appear in court as a representative to declare the remarks made by the French Consul the day before, he also invited Director Liu Yunfang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to visit the French Consul General again to inquire about the matter. Mr. Liu went to the French Consulate at 3:30 p.m. to meet with Consul General Gan and stated that since the case had been discussed the day before and arbitration procedures were underway, the legal proceedings should be stopped immediately. Why did the French Court of Public Affairs still re-hear the case at 3:00 p.m. today? Moreover, your Consul General has clearly stated and guaranteed to prevent execution. What is the purpose of the re-hearing today? Consul General Gan replied that the hearing today was because the previous date was scheduled as the date of review, and it must be done procedurally. Your representative lawyer can appear in court as usual. Although the Consul General is not a judge, he can be responsible for ensuring that the result of the re-hearing today will still not result in execution. Mr. Liu considered the reply satisfactory and then discussed the steps for arbitration. Mr. Liu said that the arbitrator of the China Merchants Bureau had been designated by General Manager Cai the day before. Your Consul General should notify the priest as soon as possible to start the negotiations between the arbitrators as soon as possible. According to the French Consul, he hoped that the China Merchants Bureau would prepare a plan for guaranteeing future rent payments on time as soon as possible. If the rent is to be paid by a bank, this document should be submitted to the French Consul General for study first, and then the French Consul General should persuade the priest of the San De Church to accept the plan. Then the arbitrator of the San De Church will formally discuss the lease issue with the arbitrator of the China Merchants Bureau. It is okay to continue to maintain the old agreement, and it is also okay for both parties to sign a new agreement. Even if a new agreement is signed, its content will not be much different from the old agreement. Consul General French finally stated to Director Liu that the water and electricity storm in the French Concession and the Jinliyuan Wharf case were all local events and not political cases. It is gratifying that the authorities and people of the two countries have resolved them peacefully with a spirit of mutual understanding. Director Liu also considered the French Consul's remarks to be satisfactory and shook hands and parted ways. He also conveyed the content of the French Consul's remarks to General Manager Cai. General Manager Cai expressed satisfaction and planned to proceed with the arbitration immediately based on the results of the talks.</p>

Without a thorough solution, how can we talk about reorganization? I only received the instructions from the National Government yesterday, the 18th. For the sake of the country and the shareholders, I still need to consider it seriously. I will go to Beijing to ask for instructions tonight, the 19th, in order to obtain a fundamental solution and open up new sources of income and reduce expenditures.

<p>About to Demand Compensation</p>
<p>Shigemitsu Aoi, Acting Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, visited Minister of Finance Song Ziwen and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Zhengting the day before. His main task was to exchange opinions informally on the issue of Japanese losses in the Changsha case, and to request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to consult with the military and police authorities to provide full protection for the lives and property of Japanese residents in various parts of the Yangtze River, and to request concrete measures to ensure safety. However, according to news from the Japanese Embassy Office yesterday, the damage and losses suffered by Japanese residents in the Changsha incident have been investigated and clarified by the Japanese Consul in Changsha, Kasuya, who has listed the details and telegraphed Acting Ambassador Shigemitsu to forward them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a request for compensation. However, in order to be cautious, Acting Ambassador Shigemitsu specially sent Okazaki, the Deputy Consul of this office, and Hafu Seikichi, the Foreign Affairs Officer of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs dispatched by the Japanese government to China to investigate the Changsha case, and Sangajima, the former Consul General in Hankou, to Changsha to conduct a detailed review to avoid repeating the mistake of the previous Sino-Japanese Nanjing case. After being entrusted with the mission and arriving in Shanghai, Officer Hafu and others will take a boat to Hankou today and then go to Changsha. The Japanese men and women living in Changsha, due to the desolate market after the looting in Changsha, were unwilling to continue their business and have all applied to the Japanese Embassy to suspend their business and return to their country. Most of them arrived in Shanghai on the Fengyang Maru yesterday. The families of the Japanese Consul in Changsha, Kasuya, and his staff also came to Shanghai on the same ship, waiting for a boat to return to their country. It is expected that the compensation for damages to Japanese residents in Changsha proposed by the Japanese this time will be considerable.</p>

<p>August 29 is the National Humiliation Day commemorating the Treaty of Nanjing. The Central Party Department has issued a notice to all levels of party departments across the country to hold commemorations. The Shanghai Municipal Party Department Propaganda Department and the China National Anti-Drug Association believe that the Treaty of Nanjing was caused by opium, and the current domestic ban on drugs has not been completely thorough.

This commemoration must be expanded. The Municipal Party Department Propaganda Department and the China National Anti-Drug Association have started preparing for the commemoration.

<p>Military Department Committee Investigates Wusong Barracks Property</p>
<p>Nanhui and Songjiang Reassigned to the Second District for Investigation</p>
<p>Hu Qin, Chen Rulin, Xu Zhensheng, Heidequan, and others, members of the Military and Political Department's committee sent to Shanghai to investigate barracks property, have been investigating at Gaochang Temple, Zhonghua Road, Penglai Road, and other locations in this city for several days. It is reported that over three hundred pieces of barracks property have been identified. However, as the military department fears that civilian barracks property may have been neglected for many years, it has re-issued regulations for the management of barracks property. Article 14 stipulates that anyone who encroaches, steals, sells secretly, conceals, or illegally obtains barracks property, or forges licenses, etc., may be reported by the public and will be rewarded. Yesterday, Hu Qin, the director of the district, told a Guowen News Agency reporter that they had completed their investigation in Jiangdu and then came to Shanghai to investigate. However, the investigation procedures are cumbersome. In order to thoroughly clear things up and save time, they have had to divide the work and investigate simultaneously. Currently, one part is in this city, and another part is dispatched to Wusong for investigation. As for Nanhui and Songjiang counties, they have been reassigned to the Second District for investigation. The district directors Xuan Jie, Zhang Mingda, He Naiyu, and Xu Jinzhang have already arrived in Nanhui to investigate the Machang barracks property. After completing the investigation in Nanhui, they will move on to Songjiang. Currently, the district has already identified over three hundred pieces of barracks property in this city and is in the process of organizing and transcribing the information. Once the investigation in Wusong and Pudong is complete, it will be reported to the military department.</p>
<p>County Construction Bureau Holds Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Construction Bureau held its 18th bureau affairs meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. The chairman was Director Wu Wenhua.

<p>Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union Submits Document to Municipal Party Headquarters</p>
<p>Requesting Correction of Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Criticisms</p>
<p>The Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union submitted a document to the Municipal... Yun, requesting that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has not clarified the truth about the addition of a representative from Tongkang Pharmacy and has made unwarranted criticisms. Since the Central Government promulgated the Law on Industrial and Commercial Associations, the union has never violated explicit orders or forced members not to join the association. However, after Tongkang Pharmacy added employee Zhang Qinzhang as a representative to the association, the union repeatedly and cautiously investigated, in accordance with the law, whether the average number of employees used by Tongkang Pharmacy in the past year exceeded fifteen. According to the investigation results, the number of employees used by the pharmacy still does not meet the regulations of the law. Therefore, the addition of an employee representative is naturally unnecessary. This is the first point that the union must legally fight for. Recently, on July 17, it was reported that the Central Political Conference dealt with the restriction on the qualifications of members' representatives in industrial and commercial associations. As a result of the research by Committee Member Dai Chuanxian and Committee Member Kong Xiangxi, it was recognized that the principle that employees should be allowed to serve as representatives of the association should be respected. However, the premise of the association to promote the common interests of the industry and correct business malpractices should also be taken into account. It is essential that labour and management coordinate, and that the two parties help and understand each other in order to achieve effective cooperation. Therefore, Article 7 of the law, which concerns the qualification of member representatives, has been revised to allow each company or firm to send one or two representatives, limited to managers or principals, but if the average number of employees in the most recent year is fifteen or more, one additional representative may be sent, who shall be mutually elected by the employees of each company or firm. This revised article has been adopted by the Central Political Conference. Looking at the above, the procedure for adding employee representatives requires that the employees of each company or firm mutually elect them. The addition of employee Zhang Qinzhang as a representative by Tongkang Pharmacy did not comply with the Central Government's revised laws and regulations, but was entrusted by Manager Du Maiqing in his personal capacity, which is illegal and exceeds his authority. This is the second point that the union must legally fight for. The Central Political Conference is the highest authority in the country for implementing policies. After any law is passed, the people of the country should absolutely abide by it. How could the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the highest organization leading the city's business community, not recognize the articles passed by the Central Political Conference and say that the union is abusing the law? This is too far from the truth and is intentionally disrespecting the Central Government. Furthermore, they say that the union is interfering and forcing Manager Du Xianqing of Tongkang Pharmacy, etc. The Chamber of Commerce does not seek the truth and makes unwarranted criticisms. This is extremely absurd. It is earnestly hoped that your committee will quickly correct this and reprimand them. In addition, it is requested that your committee immediately revoke the qualifications of employee Zhang Qinzhang as a representative from Tongkang Pharmacy. This would be of great benefit to the public.</p>
<p>Nihua Cotton Mill Labor Dispute Reported Yesterday</p>
<p>Management Announces Factory Closure for the Second Time</p>
<p>Labor Decides to Persist to the End</p>
<p>The management of Nihua Cotton Mill in Pudong, whose plot to entice striking workers back to work unconditionally was seen through by the workers and failed to succeed, suddenly announced the closure of the factory yesterday. However, the labor side regarded this as nothing and remained calm as usual. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Factory Issues Closure Notice</p>
<p>After Nihua Cotton Mill issued a notice of resumption of work the day before yesterday and no one entered the factory, the factory was greatly angered. It changed its plan and adopted intimidating measures, suddenly posting a notice last night declaring the closure of the factory, hoping to soften the workers' persistent attitude.</p>
<p>Workers Not Moved in the Slightest</p>
<p>The workers, deeply aware that this kind of intimidation is a trick used by the Japanese, have declared the closure and opening of the factory twice since the strike began. Therefore, they regard this matter as a farce and remain unusually calm. They stated that even if the factory really closes, the workers will definitely not starve to death.</p>
<p>Union Expresses Attitude</p>
<p>The organizing committee of the factory's union believes that the Japanese's declaration of the closure of the factory this time is entirely an act of intimidation and can be ignored. If the factory really closes, then China's Jisheng Cotton Mill can take the opportunity to open a factory. China has one more domestic goods manufacturer, and workers can still find work.</p>
<p>Fundraising to Help Workers</p>
<p>The organizing committee of the factory's union believes that this strike must persist to the end. However, according to investigations, the workers' livelihood can be maintained for about three and a half months. However, it cannot be said for certain whether the Japanese will come to their senses after three and a half months. Therefore, they gathered last night to discuss and submitted a request to the Municipal Party Department to allow fundraising to provide relief. Once approved, they will start to proceed.</p>
<p>Pudong Labor Circles Donate First</p>
<p>According to recent news from various labor unions in Pudong, the demands of the Nihua workers have a great impact on various labor unions in Pudong. Because they have a personal connection, they must help them. Within two or three days, they will automatically convene a general meeting of representatives from various labor unions in Pudong to discuss how to deal with the Nihua Cotton Mill and use economic assistance to help the factory's workers. Then, they will send a letter to all labor unions in Shanghai, citing the method of aiding French business strikes, with each person donating one dollar.</p>
<p>French Concession Taxpaying Chinese Association Sends Letter to Director-General Fei</p>
<p>Expressing Gratitude for Mediating Water and Electricity Labor Dispute</p>
<p>The water and electricity labor dispute in the French Concession has been resolved. The Chinese Taxpaying Association of the French Concession sent a letter to Director-General Fei of the French Municipal Council, expressing its gratitude. The letter reads, "Director-General Fei, respectfully informing you that the water and electricity workers' strike lasted for fifty-four days. Fortunately, Director-General Fei, in consultation with the Consul-General, managed the situation effectively, avoiding the spread of the issue and affecting public security. The citizens within the concession are truly grateful. After this resumption of work, it is hoped that your Director-General will instruct the tram company's superintendent to find ways to mediate between labor and management in the future, so that each party can be treated fairly. This will prevent any misunderstandings, stabilize local public security, and allow all businesses to flourish. Sincerely, we respectfully wish you well. Sincerely, the Chinese Taxpaying Association of the French Concession."</p>

<p>Municipal Works Bureau to Repair Chaodong Dam in Gaohang District</p>
<p>There is a Chaodong Dam near Qingning Bridge at the western end of Yangjia Alley in the Gaohang District of the city. It was suddenly washed away by a storm a few days ago, and traffic was immediately cut off. Hundreds of acres of farmland nearby were flooded. The Municipal Port Affairs Bureau sent a letter to the Municipal Works Bureau, requesting that workers be sent to rebuild it immediately to facilitate wealth and protect the people's food supply. After receiving the letter, the Municipal Works Bureau immediately sent personnel to investigate, stating that the Chaodong Dam is closely related to water conservancy and transportation. The need to restore it quickly after it was washed away by the storm is necessary. A special report was submitted to the Municipal Government, requesting that funds be allocated for repairs. It was learned yesterday that the Municipal Government has issued an order approving the allocation.</p>
<p>Seventeen New Stations to be Added to Two Railways</p>
<p>Liu Weichi Granted Approval by the Ministry of Railways to Proceed as Planned</p>
<p>Liu Weichi, the director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureaus, proposed several measures to improve the two railways. Yesterday, the Ministry of Railways issued an order approving the proposals. Among them, the addition of new stations to the two railways is particularly aimed at facilitating passengers and will begin immediately in sequence. The original plan for the location of the new stations is as follows: (A) Twelve stations to be set up on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway: (1) Between Anting and Lujiabang, (2) Between Kunshan and Zhengyi, (3) Between Suzhou and Hushu Pass, (4) Between Wangting and Jinggang, (5) Between Wuxi and Shitangwan, (6) Between Luoshe, (7) Between Qishuyan and Changzhou, (8) Between Lucheng and Lingkou, (9) Between Xinfeng and Zhaze, (10) Between Zhenjiang and Gaozi, (11) Between Gaozi and Xiashu, (12) Between Xiashu and Longtan. (B) Five stations to be set up on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway: (1) Between Shihudang and Fengjing, (2) Between Jiashan and Jiaxing, (3) Between Jiaxing and Wangdian, (4) Between Xiashi and Xieqiao, (5) Between Linping and Jianqiao. The above plan will be implemented in order of urgency. The station between Anting and Lujiabang has already been put out to tender. In addition, it is said that the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway will first build the station between Shihudang and Fengjing, approximately one station per month. At the beginning of construction, maximum savings will be sought. Express trains will not stop at these stations. Ordinary express trains will be reconsidered. Generally, only slow trains going in both directions will stop at these stations.</p>
<p>Registered Letters to Nanyang Insurance</p>
<p>Must be Written in Roman Script</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration announced that when sending insured and registered letters to the Nanyang Islands and the Malay Federation, if only Chinese characters are used for names and addresses, it is quite inconvenient for delivery, and misdelivery is unavoidable. Therefore, all senders are notified to quickly obtain translated slips of the names and addresses of their relatives and friends in advance and affix them to the envelope for mailing. From now on, registered and insured letters sent to the destination must be written in Roman script so that the post office can accept them.</p>

<p>Sharp Decline in Passengers and Goods in Hankou</p>
<p>The authorities in Hankou recently issued a curfew order, cutting off traffic at 8:00 PM every day. Therefore, the cargo volume of downstream steamers from Hankou to Shanghai has drastically decreased. Because the various ports cannot work at night, the number of passengers traveling from Hankou to Shanghai has also greatly decreased, at least one-third compared to a week ago. Currently, there are a total of twenty-two warships from five countries, Britain, Japan, the United States, France, and Italy, docked in Hankou, reportedly the largest number of foreign ships berthed in Hankou.</p>

<p>The Famine Relief Society Solicits Aid for Victims in Xuchang and Mi County</p>
<p>Zhou Xiwun, a representative stationed in Shanghai of the Henan Province Famine Relief Society, recently received two telegrams from the province, which are transcribed below: (1) "To Shanghai, Beijing, and various charitable organizations and newspapers: According to reports from various agencies in Xuchang County, the county was heavily garrisoned by troops last winter, and the people are in extreme hardship. This spring, tens of thousands of troops are stationed, apportioning cash and providing grain, amounting to several million yuan. The people are impoverished and have exhausted their grain. They were hoping for a good wheat harvest in the autumn, but unexpectedly, war broke out again, and the entire county was reduced to a war zone. Dozens of days of fierce fighting resulted in wheat being abandoned on the ground, houses turned into ruins, corpses littering the fields, and chickens and dogs silenced. The southern part of the county also suffered hail, breaking off all the wheat ears, leaving no grain to harvest. It is extremely tragic and painful. Please provide urgent relief. Li Shizan, Chairman of the Henan Province Famine Relief Society." (2) "Abbreviated title: Recently, according to reports from various agencies in Mi County, the remaining people after the disaster have suffered repeated calamities. On May 4th, hail suddenly fell, with hailstones as large as bowls, lasting for about an hour. The wheat in areas such as Yuetai was completely destroyed, and many houses and livestock were damaged. In areas with less severe damage, the wheat harvest was reduced by 60-70%. In the northeastern area of Guanyintang, when the wheat was being threshed, more than a thousand bandits suddenly came, attacking, killing, burning, and looting, burning all the stacked wheat in the fields in the area. The hope of a wheat harvest has been dashed. On June 15th, hail fell again, as large as fists, lasting for about fifty minutes, accumulating to a thickness of about five inches, causing the fields in the northeastern and southeastern areas to be completely destroyed. The central area is suffering from extreme drought, with the seedlings withered, and the autumn harvest is hopeless again. The sound of crying fills the roads, begging for urgent relief. It is reported that the remaining people in the county are waiting to be saved, but natural and man-made disasters continue to increase. Remaining lives are hanging by a thread. It is hoped that kind-hearted people from all walks of life will show great compassion and provide large-scale relief to save the people. Li Shizan, Chairman of the Henan Province Famine Relief Society." It is reported that Representative Zhou, after receiving these two telegrams, went to various charitable organizations to plead for relief.</p>

<p>Local News Two Nights Ago, a Woman was Assassinated on Latour Road</p>
<p>Two Gunshots Pierced the Air</p>
<p>A Woman Collapsed in a Pool of Blood</p>
<p>The Woman's Corpse was in a Very Tragic State</p>
<p>No Findings in the Surrounding Area</p>
<p>At 7:40 PM last night, an anonymous shooting occurred in front of the residence of M. Meunier, a French national from the Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank, located at 525 Latour Road, French Concession. The victim was a young woman, approximately in her twenties. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Location is Extremely Remote</p>
<p>525 Latour Road, French Concession, is the residence of M. Meunier of the Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank. The location is extremely remote, at the southernmost end of Latour Road. Every evening, there are very few pedestrians, and except for a small number of Western residences near the road, the rest are barren tombs or connected vegetable fields.</p>
<p>Two Gunshots</p>
<p>At around 7:40 PM last night, just as Mr. Mann was finishing his supper, he was resting indoors, when the servant Yang Xiuyan, a Hebei native, came to bring tea, and suddenly heard a loud noise near the gate on the road. The master and servant heard the noise, and immediately looked at each other and paid attention, listening carefully, but there was no other movement. At first, they suspected that it was a rickshaw tire bursting. About ten minutes later, another shot was heard in the wasteland behind the house.</p>
<p>Collapsed Woman</p>
<p>After the second shot, Mr. Mann realized that it was a gunshot, but there was still no other movement, so he ignored it. After another ten minutes, at about 8:00 PM, Mr. Mann wanted to go to Maple Grove Bridge to meet a friend, so he drove out in his own car. Unexpectedly, as soon as he arrived at the entrance, he saw a woman lying in a pool of blood by the road on the right side of the door.</p>
<p>Shape of the Woman's Corpse</p>
<p>In a state of shock, Mr. Mann immediately turned around and went back into the house, and urgently used the telephone to notify the patrol of Shanzhong Road, which was in charge. The head of the patrol immediately dispatched a western detective along with patrol detectives Su Deshan and Qian Yumin to rush to the scene of the incident. After a detailed examination, they saw that the woman's corpse was about twenty years old, with short hair hanging down to her shoulders, a slightly collapsed nose, wearing a white Indian silk cheongsam, only reaching her knees, black silk stockings, and white silk shoes with embroidered landscape patterns.</p>
<p>A Bullet Through the Head</p>
<p>The skin on the left knee of the corpse's silk stockings was scratched. The right palm was covered with mud and bloodstains. Judging from the situation, it seemed that she had been dragged there by an enemy and tried to struggle and resist without success. A white gauze rope was tied around her right arm, and there was a piece of newspaper containing white gauze and a pair of men's shorts. There were only twenty-five copper coins in the pocket of the shorts, and nothing else. A bullet hole in her right eye socket pierced the back of her head. The situation was very tragic.</p>
<p>Investigation in the Wilderness</p>
<p>After examining the corpse, the detectives went to the back of the house to investigate the trace of the second shot. At that time, it was extremely dark. The reporter, moved by curiosity, also followed the crowd to investigate. Unexpectedly, the back of the house was all wilderness, with several acres of fields, all planted with green eggplant. The southern part was covered with grass up to the ankles, with a solitary grave inside, surrounded by an earth enclosure. In front of the enclosure was a small pond with a circumference of more than forty steps. After searching almost everywhere, there was no trace. They returned to the patrol to report, and notified the Tongren Fuyuantang to carry the corpse to the coroner's office to await examination today.</p>
<p>The Myth of a Maid Resurrecting After Dying from Illness</p>
<p>Lively Streets in the Dark World</p>
<p>Ten Years of Life Extended After Being Pushed and Falling Awake</p>
<p>A maid named Lu, about thirty years old, who worked for a certain family in Anshun Lane, Kandi Road, French New Concession, suddenly fell ill on the 10th of this month and died soon after. At that time, the employer, because the corpse's chest and other parts were still warm and not cold, did not dare to hastily encoffin and bury it, and temporarily set it aside. They also sent a letter to Lu's family to come to Shanghai to handle the matter. This went on for five days. Unexpectedly, Lu suddenly woke up and resurrected. At this time, the employer's whole family was shocked and could not stop. Afterwards, they asked Lu about what happened after death. Lu described the situation after death, saying that after death, she went to a dark world, where there were many vendors, all kinds of goods were available, and there were shops, very lively, especially like the streets of the Yangjian. While walking, she met an old woman who had passed away more than ten years ago, who scolded me sternly and said, "What are you doing here? This is not a place for you to come. You still have more than ten years of Yangshou." After saying this, she stretched out her hand and pushed me to the ground, and I woke up from the shock. The employer and his family were horrified when they heard this. Since then, Lu's illness has been cured, and she has quit her job and returned to her hometown to recuperate with her family.</p>
<p>Lawyer Personality Case Heard Yesterday</p>
<p>Gu Yongquan Filed Counterclaim, Difficult to Reach Settlement</p>
<p>Zou Yu Said There are Many Scoundrels Among Shanghai Lawyers</p>
<p>Wang Chengkuan Asked to Record That He Scolded Me as a Thief</p>
<p>Qu Shunxiang and Zhou Jianren were involved in a criminal lawsuit in the Shanghai District Court due to a dispute over ancestral graves. This led to a conflict between the two lawyers, Wang Chengkuan and Gu Yongquan, who were acting as witnesses when the documents were signed. Gu pointed out that Wang was too unprincipled and was a scoundrel among lawyers. At that time, Judge Shen Xing intervened and said that there should be no public insults in the courtroom. Lawyer Wang Chengkuan, feeling that Gu was also a commissioned lawyer, each seeking the interests of the parties, and should not publicly insult him in court, filed a lawsuit with the court, requesting legal action. The defendant, Gu Yongquan, in addition to defending himself, also filed a counterclaim, stating that the plaintiff, Wang Chengkuan, should not have slandered him in court. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Zhao opened the third hearing. The plaintiff, Wang Chengkuan, was represented by lawyer Tao Jiachun, and the defendant, Gu Yongquan, was represented by lawyer Zou Yu. After the judge took his seat, the plaintiff, Wang Chengkuan, first stated the facts of the insult and requested that it be dealt with and ordered that the verdict be published in the newspaper. The defendant, Gu Yongquan, said that because Wang Chengkuan said that on May 26, I offered him a bribe of 2,000 yuan, which he refused, and turned around and accused me, so I said that Lawyer Wang was too unprincipled and made false testimony, and was a scoundrel among lawyers. However, I am a witness, and the dispute with the witness is not an insult. Wang Chengkuan falsely accused me of bribery of 2,000 yuan, but I was in the Special District Court at 2:00 PM that afternoon, appearing in the Shimin Bank fraud case, so I had no time to bribe. This shows that he is slandering my reputation, and I request an investigation. Lawyers Ye Fikang and Jiang Baolian can testify to this, and I request that they be summoned. Wang Chengkuan replied that the defendant has already admitted to public insult, and the case is self-incriminating, so there is no need for Ye Fikang and Jiang Baolian to testify. As for the matter of him offering me 2,000 yuan, it is true that the party, Hua Jingtang, was present and can testify. When I testified at that time, I stated this matter to the judge after the defendant scolded me first. Whether to adopt it or not is the judge's freedom. If it is false testimony, it can also be transferred to the prosecutor's office for investigation by the judge. The defendant should not scold others with insulting words such as unprincipled scoundrel. At this point, the judge asked Tao Jiachun, the lawyer hired by the self-incriminating party, if he had any comments. Lawyer Tao stood up and said that as for this case, the defendant has already admitted to public insult, which is certainly established. However, after this case occurred, this lawyer and Lawyer Jiang Baolian had consulted on a settlement in order to settle the matter. Today we are still in consultation, so the defendant should request an adjournment in order</p>

Thousand Packages of Japanese Yarn Futures, All of Which Are Thoughtful Transactions, According to the World Situation, It Is Unusually Pessimistic, but the Buyer's Psyche Is That Production in

Prices, New Cotton Operations Proceed Smoothly Cotton Market Falls Sadly, Actually Because American Cotton Has Experienced a Violent Falling Trend, Spot Has Reached a New Record of One Dime One Cent, the Local Cotton Has Long Had Unstable Signs, Although There Is Tightening by Long Positions, People's Hearts Have Greatly Panicked, and Scattering Long Positions Can Only Endure the Pain of Ending, Because the Difference Compared to Foreign Markets Is Too Great, Moreover, Exchange Rates Have Lengthened, Indian Cotton Has Made Large-Scale Transactions at Unusually Low Prices, and at the Same Time, Various Reports Have Indicated That New Cotton Operations Are Proceeding Smoothly, If the Weather Has No Changes, A Bumper Harvest Can Be Expected, So Although the Speculated Market Has Some Pull, It Is Ultimately Difficult to Reverse the Tide, and the Trend of Cotton Market Collapse Cannot Be Suppressed, Speculated Cotton Breaks Through the Three-Tael Line Han Standard Opened in the Morning with American Cotton Falling Fiercely, People's Morale Was Very Weak, Selling Was Even More Strong, and Some Long Positions Ended, Each Falling Five and a Half Cents to Seven and a Half Cents, In the Afternoon, A Large Batch of Indian Cotton Was Made, Market Conditions Became Even More Declining, Later, Shenchang Bought in and Slightly Recovered, With Each Falling Seven Cents to Eight

Due to Reduced Consumption, Recently, It Has Been Predicted That the Harvest Is Good, And the World's Cotton Industry Is Still in Trouble, Market Sentiment Has Changed Sharply, And the Falling Wind Is Fierce and Reaches One Dime One Cent, Exceeding the Low Price of the Great Harvest of 1926, And Approaching the Low Price of One Dime Eight Li Five in 1920, The World's Cotton Market Is Not as Good as the Shadow's Following, And It Falls With It, Although Local Cotton Follows Downward, It Has Not Been Able to Form a Considerable Proportion, This Is Really a Great Blow to the Prospects of the Cotton Market, In Recent Years, Domestic Natural Disasters and Man-Made Disasters Have Continued, Cotton Production Has Suffered Major Losses, Resulting in Insufficient Domestic Demand, And Market Prices Are High, And Manufacturers Do Not Meet the Calculations, While Foreign Cotton Is Devalued and Competitively Sold, Resulting in an Abundance of Foreign Cotton, And the Actual Position of the Cotton Market Has Suffered Major Losses, This Past Situation Is Worthy of Attention, Recently, American Cotton, Which Dominates the World Cotton Market, Has Experienced a Strong Falling Wind, And Indian Cotton, Due to Unsettled Domestic Political Situation and Reduced Consumption, Has Good Progress in New Cotton, Competing to Sell Abroad, Chinese and Japanese Manufacturers Have Already Made Large Purchases, And Recent Devaluation Has Increased Transaction Numbers, While Hua Cotton, Manipulated by Speculators, Is Held Still, And the Attitude of Those in Need Is Extremely Calm, Judging from the Recent Calm State of Spot Cotton Transactions and New Cotton Transactions, It Can Be Generally Seen, Moreover, This Year's Domestic Cotton Body Is Suitable for Good Weather, Proceeding Well, If There Are No Special Changes, Although We Dare Not Say It Is a Bumper Harvest, It Should Not Lose a Medium Harvest, If Manufacturers Have a Large Amount of Absorption of Foreign Cotton, Enough to Supply Consumption, Then Future Hua Cotton Needs Will Be Increasingly Lacking, And the Cotton Market's Position Will Be Increasingly Bad, This Is Not the Reporter's Fixed Word of Danger, Try to Look Back at the Past Situation, And You Can Understand Its Outline, Therefore, According to the Reporter's Prediction, Hua Cotton Can Be Between Thirty-One and Two Taels, Or It Can Attract the Attention of Those in Need, And Can Stand in a Relatively Stable Position, (Agriculture) the World's Yarn Has a Trend of Collapse American Cotton Spot Opens One Dime One Cent Yesterday, American Cotton Was Extremely Tired Due to Disappointed Manufacturer Attitudes and Good Cotton Harvest Conditions, Futures Fell 54 to 63 Pounds, Spot Fell 60 Pounds, British Cotton Futures Fell 234 Points, Spot Fell 28 Points,

Numbers, Chang Gang Broken Rice Was Sold Plainly, Top Goods Were Twenty-One Yuan, Zhongguan Ping Reduced Slightly With Repair Because Factory Stack Stored Rice, Sales Intentions Tended to Be Congested, But Each Stall's Retail Sales Were Quiet, Second Rice Transactions Were Few, Dongxin Rice's Prices Were Still Nineteen Yuan Half on the Surface, It Seems That It Will Soon Go Downstream, New Customer Point Goods From the North Road Come One After Another, Prices Still Hover Around Fifteen Yuan, But Few Goods Under the Shoulder Have Seen Entering the Border, Bai Yuan Arrived Rarely and Was Sold Refreshingly, Large Disk Was Firmly Fixed, Huh Nan There Were Five or Six Ships Arriving Down the River, Northern Gang White Rice, Because Existing Arrivals Were Exhausted, Buyers Turned Their Attention to Foreign Rice, So Transactions Were Dull, And Prices Also Remained Fixed Throughout, Nan Gang's Thin Rice Was Sold As Soon As It Arrived, High Goods Were at the Twenty-One Yuan Barrier, New Rice Prices Were Similar to Those in the Northern Market, Later Yuan Arrived With Increasingly Exhausted Goods, Market Conditions Were Surprisingly Quiet, Top Goods Standards Were Still Around Nineteen Yuan, Foreign Rice Sales Were Stagnant and Continued to Fall Yesterday, There Were Still No Large Gangs in Foreign Rice to Digest, And Early Rice and Customer Indica Were Approaching the Market, Each Gang's Office Intentions Were Even More Light, Yesterday's Market Only Had Countryside and Inland Gangs Slightly Accommodating, Total Daily Transactions Were Less Than Two Thousand Packages, Prices Fell Another Two Corners, It Is Estimated That One Number Saigon Was Offered Two Hundred Packages, Prices Were Sixteen Yuan Three Corners, Minda Was Two Hundred Packages, Prices Were Fourteen Yuan Seven Corners, Ke Gan Rice Was Six Hundred Packages, Prices Were Fourteen Yuan Half, Large Twist Was Three Hundred Packages, Prices Were Twelve Yuan Six Corners, Small Twist Rough Was Five Hundred Packages, Prices Were Eleven Yuan Seven Corners, Small Twist Rice Inventory Was Very Small, Owners Were Unwilling to Easily Dispose of It, Resulting in No Transactions, But At Present, Total Rice in Storage in Shanghai Is Less Than Two Hundred Thousand Packages, If Large Gangs Digest It, The Market Can Immediately Turn Around, But It Is Too Stagnant, Resulting in a Step-by-Step Decline, And Early Rice Is on the Market Everywhere, And the Year's Harvest Is Also Good, After This, When Output Increases, The Ban Will Be Relaxed, And Customer Indica Can Replace Foreign Rice to Meet the Market, Therefore, People's Hearts Are Mostly Pessimistic, And the Market Is Seen in a Downturn, Speculated Flour Market Is Released and Falls Sharply Evening Market Slightly Turns Steady Yesterday's Futures Flour Market in the Morning, All Months' Markets Fell Sharply in Unison, Because Foreign Wheat Quotations Continued to Fall, And the Gold Market Also Reported a Continuing Fall of Five or Six Taels, People's Hearts Inside and Outside the Industry Were Shaken, And Sellers of Foreign Flour from Foreign Firms Heard That the Return Telegram for Citibank Flour Had Turned to Four Yuan Five Cents, And Transactions Could Be Made, Although the Shanghai Price Was Still Difficult to Match the Profit, But Speculating on the Trends Abroad, There Will Be a Chance to Come to China in the Future, Therefore, People's Hearts Turned Tired, And General Floating Air All Returned and Exited, And the Market Fell Sharply, Until the Afternoon Opened, Because Floating Long Positions Were Quite Strong in Covering Positions, Market Sentiment in Each Month Slightly Turned Steady Again, Looking at the Subsequent Situation, There Should Be Foreign Quotations, Once Foreign Flour and Wheat Are Suitable, It Will Be Difficult to Rebind Here, As a Result, This Month Fell One and a Half Points Compared to the Previous Day, September and November Fell Two Cents Seven and a Half Li Each, October Fell Two Cents Two and a Half Li, December and January Fell Three Cents, the Futures Wheat Market Generally Trended Loose Lowered by Foreign Wheat Price Quotations Yesterday's Futures Wheat Market, Generally Trended Downward in Each Month, Because After the Gold Price Turned Downward, The Exchange Rate Naturally Followed, And Foreign Wheat Quotations Fell Another Seven or Eight Corners, So Ardent Long Positions Could Only Give Up And Stop Hard Support, So Opening Prices in Each Month Stepped Downward, This Situation Seems to Be Dominated by Foreign Quotations, It Cannot Be Conclusively Determined in Fact, But Until a Few Afternoon Rounds, The Local Gang, Who Was Speculating, Saw That the Market Value Was Still Suitable, And All Had Taken in Each Month, So the Market Presented a Fixed Situation Again, As a Result, This Month Fell Three Cents Compared to the Previous Day, September to November Fell Five Cents Each, December Had No Comparison, January Fell Five Cents, the Current Wheat Market Situation Is That Standard Is Not Vibrant, And Large and Small Factories Are Holding Back And Not Handling It, So Each Stall Is Opening at Five Cents or So, The Whole Market Is Doing Xuzhou and Yaowan Wheat Over One Thousand Packages, Which Was Eaten In By Experts, But Has Not Yet Been Distributed, Head Goods Prices Fall With Exchange Market In Recent Days, Because

<h3 id="e86">Repatriation of Overseas Chinese from Japan Continues <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Laborers in Nagoya: Due to the economic downturn, Japanese factories are embracing cost-cutting policies, and Chinese laborers employed within these factories are being repatriated one after another. Workers dismissed from various factories in Nagoya's Naka Ward, facing destitution, are being sent back to Shanghai. The first batch includes Wu Hexun, Qiu Yinlu, Chen Dengjin, Qiu Chaomei, Ye Yongshan, Xia Chao, Fei Yisunlu, Lin Qifei, Jin Dengfei, Ren Zizhong, Wu Chaomei, Jiao Ruiren, and others, mostly from Qingtian, Zhejiang. Their return from Japan is in a pitiful state. Two or three more batches of Chinese laborers are scheduled to arrive. Furthermore, a group of individuals who were making a living in the area through skilled trades has also been sent back to Shanghai by the Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants in Yokohama: Chinese in Tokyo and Yokohama who were engaged in petty vending, kimono and food businesses, and barbering have already been sent back over 500 li by the Japanese. Now, Chinese from Asakawa Yamashita-cho and Fukagawa in Tokyo, facing destitution, are also being sent back to Shanghai by the Japanese authorities in succession. A group including Liang Zhaozhen, Fang Acun, Le Quansheng, Xiang Zhiqing, Yu Xinfa, Tang Yannan, Zhang Zhongbin, Zheng Baimei, and others, were forced onto a Japanese ship and expelled back to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Shanghai Import and Export Trade <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Sharp Increase in July</p>
<p>According to a recent survey, the total value of Shanghai's foreign trade in July was 46 million Haikwan taels for imports and 39 million Haikwan taels for exports. Compared with June, imports increased by more than 8 million Haikwan taels and exports increased by more than 5 million taels, an average increase of 14% to 20%. However, compared with the same period last year, imports are still down 5% and exports are down 7%. Since the soaring gold prices, the port's import and export trade has plummeted and declined. The sudden increase in July was unexpected. Based on the current situation, there is hope for the recovery of Shanghai's import and export trade. If the military situation can be settled soon, with the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, Shanghai's foreign trade will surely develop further.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Guns for the Yixian Warship to be Shipped to Shanghai <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The construction of the Yixian cruiser, newly built by the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy Department, is proceeding actively. The steel plates and framework of the hull have been installed, and the launching ceremony is scheduled for November, with full completion expected in April next year. The cost is estimated at 2 million yuan. The large and small guns to be installed, all ordered from Germany, include over ten 8-inch and 6-inch guns. The cost is no less than 2 million yuan. It is heard that they have been manufactured and will soon be shipped to Shanghai by mail ship in succession.</p>

<p>Instructions Received from the Finance Department Yesterday</p>
<p>Regarding the funding issues for the Shanghai County Government, the Shanghai County Finance Bureau received instructions from the Provincial Finance Department yesterday, stating, "For compliance, the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Instruction No. 472 states: 'According to item 14 of the discussion matters at the 319th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee, Committee Member and concurrently Director of the Finance Department, Qi Cai, proposed a plan to address financial difficulties. After deliberation, (1) military police salaries and educational subsidies will be issued as usual; (2) each agency's expenses will be issued at 50% first, to be managed by the agencies themselves, temporarily for August and September; supplements will be issued successively after October; (3) other expenses that can be deferred will be jointly determined by the relevant authorities and reported to the meeting,' etc. In addition to separate communications, a memorandum is issued to the Department for instructing the affiliated departments to comply with the above." Following this, in addition to distributing the information, a memorandum is issued to the Director of the Bureau for compliance, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Pilot Training Institute Re-Urges Pilots of All Ships to Attend Classes <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Yangtze River Pilot Training Institute of the Navy Department sent a letter yesterday to the Shanghai Shipping Association and various shipping companies, stating: "Respectfully informing you, according to the Hydrographic Office's forwarded Instruction No. 338 from the Navy Department: 'For your information, the pilot profession is responsible for navigating ships through dangerous waterways, bearing a heavy responsibility. All regulations regarding collision avoidance, temporary warnings, and various signal markers must be clearly understood to ensure appropriate responses. Currently, Yangtze River pilots are only familiar with the river's depth changes, and few are proficient in navigation skills. This is vastly different from the qualifications required of pilots in other countries. The Pilot Examination Regulations will be promulgated soon, stipulating the exclusive use of nationals. If such talent is not cultivated in advance, it may provide grounds for criticism from foreigners. The Training Institute is responsible for guidance and encouragement and should order measures to be taken to promote learning, either by informing the pilot associations or consulting with shipping companies, to carefully guide the pilots, inspire their enthusiasm for learning, and encourage their progress, without allowing them to be sporadic in their studies, lest they miss the course. Report the pilot training situation at any time. This is essential,' etc. Following this, pilot services are inherently related to maritime rights, and also have a great relationship with the business operations of various commercial ships. Deep expertise in navigation is necessary to gain the trust of Chinese and foreign parties. Currently, Chinese pilots lack research in the navigation-related sciences needed, making it difficult to compete with foreigners. To prepare for the implementation of the Yangtze River pilot system, the government has established an institute for training, developing complete pilot talent, and stipulating the exclusive use of nationals, which is intended to consider both the current and future benefits of all pilots. Regarding pilots who cannot attend classes on time due to business reasons, this institute has also taken this into consideration. Therefore, pilots who are often in Shanghai and those who return to Shanghai with ships are required to attend classes on time. This has previously been communicated to your company for reference and to inform the pilots to comply.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>In accordance with the aforementioned instruction, we respectfully request that your company comply with the spirit of the Ministry's instructions, diligently persuade all employed Yangtze River pilots registered with this institute to strive to learn, attend classes on time, and carefully study navigation skills, so that they may be qualified to take the examination and obtain a formal business license. Please also instruct them not to rely solely on their current experience and become complacent, hindering their studies and missing the examination. This matter concerns the vital interests of each pilot, so please do not hesitate to observe, but strive to make progress and become complete pilot talent, in strict accordance with the Ministry's instructions. We have high expectations. In addition to notifying separately, this letter is to inform you for reference and to inform all pilots to comply. Sincerely, (Another letter to the Pilot Association, content omitted for brevity.)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Request for Postponement of Autonomous Region Division <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Beijing and Shanghai Municipal Governments Will Jointly Submit a Request</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government, noting that after the promulgation of the Municipal Organization Law, the deadline for dividing autonomous regions is imminent, and that Shanghai's area is vast, making the process even more difficult, has specifically requested the Nanjing Municipal Government to send a copy of the various district division procedures for reference. It is now heard that the Beijing Municipal Government has replied to the Shanghai Municipal Government, stating that it is also difficult to complete the task as scheduled, and that the Beijing and Shanghai Municipal Governments plan to jointly submit a request to the National Government to request a postponement.</p>
