<p>潘仰堯（上海職業指導所）上海職指所立於十六年九月當時事務頗簡迄今事業日緊、中以職業談話爲尤多、每日平均四十人、除升學就業服務指導以外、關於健康法律方面亦須注意、故最近有健康指導與法律指導之添設、至職業介紹方面每月統計登記者三百人、成就者占十分之一、又以上海營業性質之學校及不良之函授學校頗多、故編輯升學指南一書、以示南鍼、此本所開辦之經過情形也、再數年前敎育界與職業界病在不溝通、故各機公司多數不喜用職校畢業生、現在各機關對於中等以上畢業生漸加信仰、最近中央各部各地建設機關及銀行工廠商店等託、本所物色職校畢業生尤以工科學生爲最需要、即共明證、自本的忧立後、南京嘉定無錫吳縣亦先後舉辦漸爲社會人所注意、近日職業界之趨勢應注意工業、故於學生升學極力提倡學工業、以備地方之用、此後職業指導、擬注意心理測騐職業分析與材能興趣、正在研究進行之中、</p>
<p>鍾道贊博士職業指導關於青年前途甚大、福建職業指導所、以政局關係致所定方針不能一一實行但各地都漸興起確爲欣幸、</p>
<p>范寳華（滬江大學）本校舉行職業指導之目的有二、（一）大學生初入學時不知入何科爲宜將來畢業後不知何以服務本校有鑒於此故列職業指導爲必修科（半年）此科爲大學一年生而設由劉校長敎授每週一時、一方要理論與經騐敎授一方率領學生參觀實業機關以資考鏡又以課堂中工作不夥實用故設職業指導部、務使社會學學校接近、且尣生之環璄個性各各不同、苟不加指導、則畢業生至機關服務往往學非所用未畢業之學生往往感所學少興趣故兄弟與劉校長除聯絡各機關詢問學生外每週必召集學生討論一小時、此法試騐以來歷有二年極有興味故兄弟以職業指導頗關重要、最好列入課和中、俾學生將來不致誤入歧途也、</p>
<p>沈公健博士職業指導應先注重心理測騐、故對學生之興趣環境習慣等須加注意、希望將來更用科學方法使學理均合實用、如塡表談話等此事一時難於見效、將來總達到目的也、美國之測騐可作爲標準、</p>
<p>張雄飛（嘉興縣立商校）本校成立職業介紹委員會以來、迄已一年、結果殊不佳、一因當地社會對於初中畢業生無信仰心、二因初中生畢業後不屑習商現擬與商界聯絡使畢業生於畢業前一月至商店實習、</p>
<p>王天民（陜西西原職中）本校編重升學指導　　鄭西谷（上海中學校長）本校辦理職業指導分校内校外兩種、（一）校内組織指導部、指導之點有三、甲修業指導、乙升學或就業指導丙服務指導、師生合作精神頗佳（二）校外對外一層頗難因敎師事忙尤其是上海、如本人對於受委託及委託者不暇應接、致消時間損失甚大余意宜多設職業指導所、使各指所聯合辦理、務使供者與需者交相得益述畢主席謂内地舊習慣甚深、校中畢業生成績儘好亦無用如學校迎合社會固失敗如不相容亦失敗故本席主張創造職業或改良職業、並要求上海職業指導所爲各地指導所之指導者、</p>
<p>張應巢（盛澤羣育館）鄙人在盛澤辦羣育館有年特設圖書館博物館工餘娱樂部使商界青年有進修之機會近年上海種種惡習、幾一一移至内地商界夥友因之失業者漸多、現擬辦一職業指首所以資救濟</p>

<p>近去首都。盛聞老友梁鼎銘君建畫室於靈谷寺之陽。將作大幅油畫以爲陣亡將士公墓紀念堂之壁飾也。梁君粤人。以油畫木炭等見長。供職黄埔軍校及中央黨部。作畫皆富於革命性。時人故稱爲革命畫家。曩者以蔣主席之命赴歐考察美術。返國後適中央議建陣亡將士公墓有籌委會之設。主席爲蔣中正。委員爲何應欽等。秘書爲陳果夫。建築師爲西人茂菲。工程師爲劉夢錫。而藝術一項。則由梁君擔任。巳設籌備處於靈谷寺。其經費預算爲五十萬元。三年乃可完工。</p>
<p>星期日余驅車訪梁君。抵寺值張靜愚張志韓何玉書諸君正與梁君爲攝影之樂。睹余至。歡道闊别。張君等去後。余乃偕梁君入室傾談。叩其作畫情形。梁君語余曰。此舉實爲余生平之一大創作。將以己之精力赴之。刻正搜羅畫材。爲革命史蹟之描寫。一方鳩工選料。建一高二十六英尺長四十二英尺之大畫室。一面已在國外定有六千元之畫布。一萬五千元之油畫顔料。俟其至。余將以三年之專力而爲此高二十英尺周圍四百英尺之壁畫也。此畫成功後。據蔣主席之意或將特建一堂以陳設之。蓋普通之建築不適用耳。預計開始工作。須在五個月之後云云。紅日在山。余乃辭别。歸而記之。以告赴靈谷訪畫者。</p>

<p>余天遂先生逝世。前已記其大槪矣。兹將未及者補述之。先生多才藝。幼居里中。隣有某羽士。善吹簫度曲。先生喜。從之而學。尊翁知之。以先生之所伍非其類也。大加訓斥。然先生之解音辨律。此其端倪矣。其師胡石予先生。工繪墨梅。先生亦效爲點染。逸氣溢楮墨間。一日忽悟山水畫理。乃自寫其胸中邱壑。意境之高。逈異尋常。第不肯多作耳。海内藏扇家心漢閣主。曾獲其山水　一。不幸於客歲游湖。遣失酒家。蓋酩酊之餘。不自檢矣。醒後。頗爲之懊喪。擬倩先生</p>

<p>每屆夏令。余恒憶　及上海黄泥牆水蜜桃。與也是園並蒂蓮。回首滄桑。不過二三十年。巳令人不勝今昔之感矣。</p>
<p>黄泥牆水蜜桃最著名。桃熟時。可入内購而飽啖。惟不准人帶出一桃。恐留核私種也。後因房屋翻造。桃樹無存焉。</p>
<p>也是園昔有並蒂蓮。盛極一時。後池中蓮花逐漸衰敗。今則但有蓮池。而無蓮花之可觀矣。重作以彌憾。不意先生一病纒綿。病竟不起。不克再事丹青。則豈心漢閣主所及料哉。先生工書。神似煖叟。曩年掌敎吳中草橋學舍。生徒輒求書聯。先生苦之曰。作書不難。磨墨爲難。生徒乃各儲墨於盎。求之不己先生更大苦之。遂徧貼潤格以爲拒。而紛煩始解。北伐功成。先生就聘吳中水警政治訓練部。文書之暇。仍鬻書以爲酒值。其宣言殊雋雅。如云。天遂阨窮矢志。十餘年來。僅以筆墨自贍。兹幸重耳復國。祿及介推。吏隠吳門。甘爲士卒。乃姓名雖賤。早露報章。舊好新知。猥以筆墨相嬲。不知服務公家。等於傭役。旣以政治爲工作。非同衙署之清閒。案牘之餘。形神已悴。亦思理我舊業。養我性靈。顧以精神所限。殆難盡人而施。爰就高明。思沾微潤。鶴俸本薄聊以養廉。嘉惠先頒。應命必速。寄情翰墨。幸無黷貨之嫌。結契苔岑。倘有嗜痴之癖。彷彿六朝小品。令人咀嚼無窮也。先生除詩古文辭外。又善金石歧黄梵學。嘗謂不侫曰。倘得暇晷。每藝事能再加若干年之揣摩。俱能名家。奈爲生活所困。終朝冗忙。精神不濟。爲可恨耳。令子某。肄業澄衷中學。課餘喜作小說。殊簡永有味。洵可造之材云。</p>

<p>赤帝肆虐。炎威若炙。僦居滬上。耳聞目擊。捨喧囂擾攘外。殊少這暑之方。七月初旬。予奉派赴京滬路短期實習。五日抵姑蘇。站中詳情。一一經站長徐永貴先生之指示。頗有心得。午後乃倡議游留園。予耳留園之名久矣。抗塵走俗。比歲以來。迄欲一往而未果。兹獲償宿願。喜可知也。入門。予儕以實習團名義。要求免費。閽者不允。堅持久之。改收半價。稍進。即見綠陰深處。曲徑蜿蜒。入一大廳。廳前有一池。濃蔭下蔽。池水黯碧若染。中多金魚。戲購餅餌哺之。羣魚爭食。激水成巨渦。友有携快鏡者。爲留影一幀焉。廳面假山而立。山疊積饒奇趣。或崛起如峭壁。或危立如巉巖。雜於衆石之中者。率爲古樹。杈枒枝幹。森立如鬼魔。山風颯然而至。不知身之在何境也。稍憩。攀援拾級而登。五步一亭。十步一閣。建築之精巧。陳列之幽邃。嘆觀止矣。右折。入東園内藏圖書集成一部。有玻樹什襲存之。惟己加封。未獲一展讀也。大廳中。有御書林泉耆碩一巨額。金碧輝煌。燦然奪目。聞係乾隆帝所手書。　門爲東山絲竹。巳下鍵。内聞爲舞榭。今則門庭冷落。凄凉不堪矣。冠雲樓前多石笋。地亦幽靜。更自「又一村」前進。繞園一大圈。登至樂亭。亭在山之巓。主人</p>

<p>由美乘大洋丸赴檀島。船主招待異常週到。特備中餐日餐。味極適口。臨别時并贈以紀念品。船于十八日八時抵火奴魯魯。即有當地華僑十餘人西人數人乘小船來迎。見者皆爭持花圈相迎。爲綰于領上。此名爲ＰＬＯＢＡ本地風俗如此。愈多愈所以表示歡迎愛敬之意。畹華所戴之圈。高齊耳際。幾不能左右顧。船抵岸有警廳長商會長太平洋聯會會長及市長之代表。華僑各會及各機關均有代表來。大約五十餘人。皆上船。市長則親立碼頭上。當時總督電知稅關及移民局。皆派人到船上接洽。稅關監督且親到船上。皆極和藹。監督對于所帶行李略事詢問。即一一簽字免騐放行。移民局委員曰。吾特來船上接治。以免在站上留難。但吾一見梅君之面足矣當與握手。又云向例每人登岸。應有允許證。此次人多。恐需時間。請君等先登岸。允許證送到旅館。以清手續可也。于是同人皆相率下船。有軍樂隊相迎。到岸晤市長。寒暄數語。市長曰。此地盼梅君有日矣。幾乎每日有來詢者。今日相見。實慰渴慕。畹遜謝。當即與市長合撮一影。其他請照相者亦極多照畢。與市長共乘一車。又有總督派來之偵探隨之。車前有警車五輛。鳴笛前行。先往謁總督。市長有事先去。總督對畹亦頌揚備至。云久聞盛名。今幸識面。前閱美國各報。知君到處備受歡迎。此次到此。本地人均異常欣悅。因檀島居太平洋之中。對于國界觀念。較大陸稍差。且政府平日亦極提倡居民與各國人士情感上之聯絡。故社會中對于中美日等國之人來此者。皆極融洽。梅君乃世界知名之士。在中國固無論矣。在日本則前數年己有大名此次在美。又受極大之歡迎。而此間居民大半此三國人居多。則梅君此來。當爲若干年來來此受歡迎者第一人也。傾談許久。并導觀其室中之關于歷央畫片。又同攝一影後。興辭而出。</p>
<p>。次往謁市長。市長正理公牘。趨迎入座。曰適己相見。又辱枉顧。君何禮之數耶。嗣談及此間居民對於國際觀念種族觀念。并無多歧視之處。蓋此地以日本人爲最多。約十三萬人。占全島十分之四。中國人次之。約三萬人。美國人亦三萬餘。高麗人六千。土著兩萬五千。斐利濱人七萬。葡萄牙人二萬八千。歐洲人兩萬五千。合種人兩萬。而各校皆共同上課。彼此感情融洽。故兩種人通婚嫁者頗多。久之。則種族觀念自淡矣。如余之父母即係兩種人。本地中國人受過高等敎育者極多。故與美國人尤爲融洽。梅君挾盛名絕藝來蒞斯土。吾知於文化上感情上當必又增進許多融洽也云云。畹因彼公事太忙。即合攝一影辭出。因往拜總領事黄君芸蘇。美國商會會長。聯太平洋議會會長。中華總商會。該會紳董多爲受過高等敎育之人。誼尤可感也。</p>
<p>有跋云。「昔王右軍。生平篤嗜種果。此中有至樂存焉。予於園之西旁。廣種杲樹築小亭於其上。顔曰至樂。亦如是云。」亭各有題名。臨游匆匆。未遑悉憶。中有一曰「聞木樨香亭。」蓋亭前滿植桂樹也。然以命名之奇。轉爲莞爾。園佔地絕廣。與滬之半淞。雖有相似處。然其清幽。則遠非任何名園所可企及。留園主人。聞爲毘陵盛氏。昔日之煊赫。於兹園蓋可想見。今則敗瓦頽垣。荒蕪不堪。盛衰相去。誠予吾人以莫大之感慨也。猶憶中有張之萬一聯云。「三徑外重增結構。」引水通舟。因峯築榭。吟歌長集友朋歡。」「卅年前曾記來游。登樓看雨。倚檻臨風。俛仰巳成今昔感。」噫。三十年後之留園。登樓傍檻。更不勝今昔之感矣。</p>
<p>出版界消息　文美術圖書公司出版之「民衆生活旬刋」。原由徐綠芙君獨任編輯。兹爲精益求精。擴充篇幅起見。特添請劉豁公君擔任編輯。劉君己於日昨前往任事自第七期起。即有劉君作品加入。同時編制方面。亦有相當之改善去。</p>

<p>第四十　章　亞美利加的小說</p>
<p>當他的長生涯的後半之間、是亞美利加文學的正式的頭目、是馬可脫温的友人兼且精細的敎師、又是年青時代中前途有望的才能的愛護者、那人就是威廉第因豪厄爾、他是愉快的人物、是到指尖爲止的藝術家、是從最初的作品乃至最後的作品的文體的巨匠、要在豪厄爾之中尋出拙劣的句子來該同在福羅貝爾或阿那托爾法蘭西之中尋出牠來一樣、是可驚的事罷、然而豪厄爾是柔怯的他缺着力、他所宣說所實行的「愼重的寫實主義」的愼重不是智能用以屈服熱情的美妙的藝術上的抑制、因爲豪厄爾沒有什麽可愼重的事、所以這是空虚的愼重、他的許多小說丨他是又勤勉又非常細心的作家丨之中、三四篇是近於天才的作品的境界的、描寫平凡的小小的人們因小而遭難的情形的「近代底實例」、是在亞美利加小說全新的東西、「失拉斯拉發謨的出世」恐怕是以普通的實業家爲主人公的最初的小說罷、後期的小說「墾通人」是他的最優的作品之一在我看來即始終如一的豪厄爾的讚美者也不能十分鑑賞那當然的價值的、他以爲自己受着托爾斯泰的影響、但在他的作品中、托爾斯泰的痕跡並不比菲爾丁的影響之在於霍桑者還多、豪厄爾是可驚佩的讀書家、寫過關於書籍的優美的文章、諸君對於他的意見無論贊同與否、在他這里總看得出有了賅博的知識的文學者、</p>
<p>亞美利加最大的小說家除了誕生以外、幾乎可以說不是亞美利加人、這就是在歐羅巴度了那成熟的生涯的大部分、而他的見解全然是歐羅巴底、世界底的亨利詹姆士、他是同世紀散文的巨匠之一、又是只有一個重要的制限的卓越的藝術家、所謂重要的製限者就是、他有難以治愈的、但因爲他的性質極寛大而富於同情的緣故不是可鄙的紳士脾氣、乃是除了在大旅館的應接室、美術館並且不消說得美備的圖書館所能學的以外、全無人生的知識的智底的「封鎖主義者」雖有那制限、他還是人類性格的深邃的研究者、用科學底話來說、就是心理家、他所描寫的人物有許多是在歐羅巴的亞美利加人、因此被稱爲國際底小說的發明家、然而眞實的國際底小說家該玩兩樣的把戲、而將在亞美利加的歐羅人也顯示出來的罷、可是、在亞美利加的歐羅巴人大槪是職工在歐羅巴的亞美利加人則大槪是閑人、而這就是詹姆士所知的階級、他的作品分爲兩個時代、屬於第一時代者是以意志薄弱的亞美利加的彫塑家爲主人公的優美的小說「羅德力霍特生、」不有理解古世界的複雜的道德及不道德的天眞爛漫的亞美利加少女的純潔凄哀的故事、「台希密勒、」對於亞美利加底的厚顔和生氣和俾俗（卑俗這一詞是詹姆士所愛用的、他將牠用得太過、竟至使這一詞成爲卑俗了、）並且着想美妙的精神底悲劇之頗爲辛辣的研究「一個夫人的肖像、」以那被安置於太過分模樣的境地的不複雜而却聰明的眞實的人爲主人公的眞的悲劇「亞美利加人」等、</p>
<p>詹姆士入第二時代便愈益巧妙、愈益複雜、使他的眞摯的一小羣讚美者喜歡、而不知他的手法的人們不快那手法就是人物的完全的客觀化、故事中的人們運行於十分普通的事情、或異常的困難的境地之中、那事情中、一個一個地閃出特性或特徵求、倘若讀者、將那小說從頭到尾讀下去、那麽他就會發見那小說家爲了自己築起完全的人類性格的事的、說明那手法的兩部小說是「鳩翼」及「金碗、」詹姆士在他的小說、是進行舒緩而費了許多頁以遵循或一動機的發展之跡的然而他又是短篇小說的巨匠包含了他那最優的短小說的八篇乃至十篇的一卷、在現代的文學該全然沒有競爭者的罷、他又是法蘭西及英吉利文學的犀利的批評家、倘若他不曾轉向小說、那麽、他該列入於文學底論文的第一流作家之間了罷、</p>
<p>一國的故事不但由稀少的天才底作家叙述出來面已、還由許多較小的作家叙述出來、那些作家的作品全體併合而構成那社會史、亞美利加是必然地分割爲智底諸州的、一個人怎能知道威爾滿的農夫兼且佐治亞的農夫呢、那些第二流的故事家中的兩三人、是在小說這藝術所保存的社會底記錄中、有着可以說、不朽的地位的、頗有聲名的詩人ＴＢ奥爾德立赤寫了幾篇動人的短篇小說、從作品、亞美利加生活描寫得並不多、然而、在那里、優美的諧謔底藝術是有的、同樣的事就佛郎克斯拖克敦而言也得當、他那最著名的小說是「淑女呢、虎呢、」南方的生活、在有眞實的才能的幾個作家的小說見得表現、揆布爾在紐疴棱斯的古昔的土着黑人的生活發見了羅曼底材料那黑奴是在赫黎斯　「利瑪伯父」之中顯着不朽的姿態的、中央西部的重要的形相保存于仔細地研究着方言的最初的亞美利加小說、（這麽說、是因爲這在距「赫克爾培利芬」數年前發表的緣故、）愛德華愛格來斯登的「胡希人的校長先生」之中、紐英格蘭的人民和風景在瑪麗尉爾琴兹福禮門及舍剌奥綸朱惠忒的細巧的故事、爲了一切時代而被描寫着、較之尉爾琴兹福禮門夫人的「母的反抗」更優的寫述普通人的故事的别的亞美利加作家的作品、我可不得而知了、</p>

<p>I have often pondered this. If the minority in a country are not good but the majority are good, then it is easy to reform. If the majority in a country are not good but the minority are good, then it is difficult to reform. Similarly, if a majority of people are enlightened about a matter, while a minority are not, then it is easy to reform. If a minority of people are enlightened about a matter, while a majority are not, then it is difficult to reform. This is because the politics of a country cannot be handled by the hands and feet of a minority, nor can their eyes and ears encompass everything. No matter how great the power of the minority, they cannot but rely on the majority to implement it. Therefore, if the majority in a country are not good, the good intentions of the minority will inevitably be turned into opportunities for the majority of implementers to engage in malpractice and evil. Therefore, reform is truly not something that can be achieved in a day or two. The difficulty truly lies in this. As for major world events, the issue of enlightenment or lack thereof is the same. No matter how enlightened the important figures of various countries may be, if the majority of their people are not yet enlightened, then even if treaties are concluded and the arguments are very clear, they will inevitably encounter opposition and obstacles when it comes to implementation. The fact that the domestic disputes between the United States and Japan have not subsided since the conclusion of the London Naval Treaty is due to this. This is because the majority of people in various countries are not yet truly enlightened about the fact that the survival and prosperity of international relations should not rely on military force, but rather on reducing armaments to increase the happiness of the people.

<p>(Nanjing) Comprehensive telegrams from various parties: (1) The rebel army, knowing that our Hunan and Guangdong armies will arrive one after another, wanted to make a desperate gamble before our army arrived. From the 11th to the 17th, the enemy on the Longhai front constantly launched fierce attacks on us, engaging in close combat day and night. The fighting on the left wing was particularly fierce. Our army, with only two divisions, faced about seven or eight divisions of Liang Ni Guanying and Ji Ni Hongchang. They defeated the rebels on the nights of the 16th and 17th. The corpses of the rebels filled the outer trenches. When they collapsed, they were shot by our machine guns, and the casualties were heavy, totaling no less than 10,000 people. According to reconnaissance reports, the three divisions of Zhang Zizhong, Zhang Yinxiang, and Ji Hongchang, who were most actively attacking our left wing, have suffered casualties exceeding half. Zhang Ni Zizhong is missing, and his survival is unknown. After this heavy blow, the morale of the rebel enemy has been completely lost. Resolving Feng Ni is not far off. Currently, more than 2,500 prisoners have been escorted here, and the captured firearms are under investigation. (2) On the Pinghan front, the Zhang Weixi, Liu Yufen, and Shi Zhenqing rebel troops launched a full-scale attack on our line in four routes on the night of the 16th. Liu Ni Yufen, based in Yancheng, was the most fierce. They first concentrated fire on us with strong artillery fire, and then their infantry advanced. After our army calmly met the attack, they lured the enemy to the foot of the city, waited for them to climb, and then continuously chopped and shot with machine guns and broadswords, killing countless enemies. In addition, a part of our army attacked from the east of the city. The enemy north of the city was attacked from the flank and suffered heavy casualties. By dawn on the 17th, the enemy could not hold out and fled north in a disarray. Our left wing, Shiwulidian Xindian, and our right wing, Xiaoyao Town and Qinglongtan line, also engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy all night, and finally defeated the entire line. In this battle, more than 300 enemies were killed. On the front of Yancheng alone, the enemy left more than 300 corpses, and more than 100 enemy guns, forty or fifty broadswords, and more than 100 enemy officers and soldiers were captured, as well as many military supplies. Our army is currently attacking the enemy from the forward positions. (21st Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e44">Turkish Kurd Rebels Rampant <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Pursued by Government Forces, They Fled into Persian Territory</p>
<p>British Instigation Behind the Scenes for Ulterior Motives</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Constantinople, 20th - The report carried by the Ankara newspaper a few days ago that the Kurd rebels had been completely defeated is clearly not entirely accurate. There are now reports of continued fierce fighting. The Turkish Army Ministry has permitted two journalists to accompany the headquarters. According to their reports, the Kurd forces are commanded by former Turkish Imperial officers and use very modern tactics, but lack supplies. Several Turkish cavalry and infantry units are currently pursuing the rebels, chasing them into Persian territory. Because the Persians failed to prevent the rebels from entering, Persian border guards automatically withdrew upon seeing Turkish troops enter, and no conflict occurred. Currently, the provinces of Van and Bayazit are being cleared of the remnants of the Kurd rebels. Many of their villages have been destroyed by the anti-bandit army. The rumor that the British are secretly instigating the Kurd rebellion is now resurfacing. Although none of this has been verified, Turkish newspapers frequently carry detailed accounts, claiming that Britain wants to unite the Kurds of Turkey and Persia into a kingdom, establishing a native as king, to resist Soviet Russia. The truth or falsity of this claim is unknown, but it shows the seriousness of the Kurd problem, which may cause a major international dispute again. Even if it doesn't, at least someone behind the scenes will try to use this issue to expand the chaos.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Informal Japanese Military Council Meeting Ends Without Result <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Privy Council's Attitude is Strong</p>
<p>Government Remains Optimistic</p>
<p>Den-tsu, Tokyo, 21st - The informal military council meeting of naval officers was held at the Naval Minister's residence this morning at 8:30 a.m. Vusimi, To-go, Zaibu, Taniguchi, Kato, Okada, six in total, all naval related military councilors attended except for General Abe who is on his way home. After Chief of Naval General Staff Taniguchi proposed an explanation of the consultation case and the reply draft, each councilor opened up and presented their opinions. However, Marshal To-go and General Kato consistently maintained a strong hardline argument. The meeting failed to reach a conclusion and is scheduled to continue tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.</p>
<p>Den-tsu, Tokyo, 21st - Prime Minister Hamaguchi told reporters yesterday morning at the　Kura villa that regarding the pros and cons of the naval armament strength agreement, regardless of how the Navy Department and the councilors' meeting argue, this is a problem within the military and is not an absolute legal requirement for the Privy Council's imperial consultation. The government is only waiting for the results of the military councilors' meeting as a matter of political expediency, and its conclusion cannot bind the government. Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki has not said that this treaty is completely flawless in terms of Japan's national defense. The government's theoretical response to the councilors' meeting is not to express approval or disapproval. Budget compilation is proving difficult at this time of financial distress. However, the government is determined to proceed according to the current plan. Regarding the allocation of surplus funds from military reduction, it cannot be determined because the treaty has not yet been ratified, but only a small portion is expected to be used in the 6th year of Showa. The parliament has said that the surplus funds from military reduction must be used for tax reduction revenue, but that refers to each year after the 6th year.</p>

<p>Nichi-Rengo, Tokyo, 21st - Naval authorities have decided to have Marshal To-go pay a visit to the Emperor on the 23rd, after the official councilors' meeting is held, to present the results of the meeting. In the reply text, not only will the treaty's armament strength shortcomings be clearly stated, but the strong hardline attitude within the Navy Department will also be expressed. However, the government remains optimistic.</p>
<p>Den-tsu, Tokyo, 21st - The Privy Council is paying close attention to the progress of the military councilors' meeting. Even if the meeting replies to the Emperor, saying that there is a way to supplement the national defense, supplementing the national defense with airplanes is too uneconomical in terms of military expenditure and completely contradicts the purpose of easing the burden on the people. Those advocating a hardline stance will use this to pursue the government's responsibility, especially the advisors at the center of the military, who say that Prime Minister Hamaguchi, who was in charge of naval minister affairs at the time the supplemental training plan was decided, made a major mistake in the attitude he adopted, so they are criticizing him severely. According to general observation, the issue of Naval Minister Zaibu's advancement and retreat will be difficult to avoid shaking the cabinet. If it implicates Prime Minister Hamaguchi and reignites the command authority issue, even if the treaty is ratified without incident, the Hamaguchi cabinet will be severely damaged.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Memorial Week for the Central Government and the National Government <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Central Party Headquarters: At 9:00 a.m. on the 21st, the Central Party Headquarters held the 69th Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week in the auditorium. Central Committee members Chen Guofu, Zeng Yangfu, Chen Lifu, Enkebatu Kexing'e, Yu Jingtang, etc., and officials from various departments and guests, totaling about 500 people, attended. Chen Guofu chaired the meeting. After the ceremony, Zeng Yangfu was asked to give a report, which stated that the so-called expanded conference in Peiping recently was asking what valid reason there was to give rise to this "expanded" name. The terms of office of the 1st and 2nd Central Committees had long expired. Even in terms of the number of members in the 2nd Committee, those serving the Party in Nanjing Central were greater than those who agreed with the reactionaries in Peiping. A comparison will easily make this clear. Furthermore, does the Party's general charter allow for the establishment of special organizations, and is there a possibility of expanding the scope? This is also self-evident. Examining its content, those listed as participating in this conference include Communists, quasi-Communists, opportunists, and corrupt elements. The participants are a mixture of all types, which can be described as a large group of counter-revolutionaries. Their purpose is to use warlords to maintain their personal status and rights, at the expense of violating Party discipline and disregarding Party authority. They claim to protect the Party and save the country, but in reality, they are destroying the Party and disrupting the country. They know that the warlords want to use reactionaries to destroy the Party, but they do not hesitate to flatter the warlords, to seek personal gain by selling out the Party. Dr. Sun said to seek peace and work hard to save China, but they insist on disrupting peace, preventing national unification, in order to achieve their separatist ambitions. Their rebellious actions are already obvious, yet they still boast of courtesy to deceive themselves and others. The eyes and ears of the people of the world cannot be covered up by one hand. I believe that the people of the whole country have full faith in the Nanjing Central Government and will not be deceived by their childish organization. Looking back at the causes and effects of the Party's history, there has never been a case where violating the ideology, losing public trust, and combining for the personal gain of a few people could last long. As long as the Party comrades can implement the spirit and work hard, this kind of boring act will soon be eliminated. As for the warlords Yan and Feng, who instigated rebellion, they promoted a kind of rhetoric, the so-called Northern Great Unity, to resist the Southern invaders, using this to bewitch the people of the North. The imperialists also used the slogan of North-South War to provoke mutual animosity and make unification never succeed. However, all Chinese people with a little common sense know that the Chinese nation has always been a whole, and does not recognize the division between North and South. Moreover, the Central Army's brave sacrifices on the front lines this time were mostly made by valiant soldiers from the North. The spirit of North-South cooperation to overthrow the warlords is clearly evident. Therefore, this war is a great battle between revolution and counter-revolution, and also the final movement to achieve peaceful unification. The Party comrades should strive to consolidate the foundation of the Party, always take the ideology as the standpoint, show a very excellent mindset, and not cause disputes due to minor incidents, nor harbor resentment due to accidental misunderstandings. With one heart and one mind, we should concentrate our inherent strength and carry out construction work, and constantly reflect on ourselves and remedy our shortcomings. Then the great success of the Party's ideology can be expected. The meeting was adjourned after the report.</p>
<p>National Government: At 10:00 a.m. on the same day, the National Government held Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. Tan Yankai, Gu Yingfen, Yu Zhengting, Zhang Nanxian, Jiang Menglin, Lin Xiang, Zhu Lühe, Li Jinlun, Zhu Jingnong, Mu Xiangyue, Zhu Peide, Chen Yi, Zhou Yawei, Wu Siyu, Chen Yu, Ma Fuxiang, Zhang Wohua, Chen Shaokuan, Zheng Hongnian, and officials from the National Government's civil and military departments, totaling more than 200 people, attended. Tan Yankai chaired the meeting. Secretary Qian Changzhao gave the following political report: "At 2:00 p.m. on the 13th, the so-called expanded conference in Huiren Hall, Peiping, actually opened. Yan and Feng can combine, the Reorganization Faction and the Western Hills Faction can combine, and Yan, Feng, the Reorganization, and Western Hills Factions can also combine. Now the expanded conference of fifteen people has actually been established. It is truly absurd. This kind of conference has no basis in the Party and increases turmoil in the country. Furthermore, the psychology of the parties involved in the conference is even more despicable and sordid. Now, let's analyze them. Yan and Feng combine for the sake of interests, which is not surprising. Yan and Feng have long forgotten about the Party. This time, they suddenly combined with the Reorganization and Western Hills Factions, wanting nothing more than to take advantage of them. The initial purpose of taking advantage of them is twofold: (1) To collude with Zhang Gui's remnants and rebels. Yan and Feng's relationship with Zhang Gui's remnants and rebels is too shallow, relying entirely on people from the Reorganization and Western Hills Factions to run errands between them. (2) Yan and Feng are not very clear about the content of the Reorganization and Western Hills Factions, and still think that they have a large potential influence in the North and South, and that they can help to make trouble in the South, and to help with propaganda in the North. But who knew that they all failed? Although Zhang Gui's remnants and rebels once stirred up trouble, they were immediately defeated and completely annihilated by the Central Government, and cannot cause trouble. Even the troublemaking and propaganda of the Reorganization and Western Hills Factions in various places did not achieve any results. Therefore, Yan and Feng's anger became greater day by day, and the Reorganization and Western Hills Factions had to be especially accommodating. Now, let's first talk about Yan's attitude towards the Reorganization and Western Hills Factions. Since Yan's defection, he has been in a panic and at a loss. He wanted to contact all kinds of reactionaries to resist the Central Government. The Reorganization and Western Hills Factions had already been running errands for him before the defection, so after the defection, they were naturally "honored guests." Although the work of the Reorganization and Western Hills Factions has not been very successful recently, Yan feels that inviting them to Peiping has cost him a lot of money, so he always wants to use them again. At the same time, Yan knows that Feng is very difficult to get along with, and he is neither willing to be under Feng nor dare to take the lead over Feng, so he is brewing an expanded conference, ostensibly to do the work of urging him to advance. On the day the expanded conference opened, the conference's signature book was the Reorganization and Western Hills Factions' contract of sale. In the event that a puppet government is established, when urging them to advance in the future, they can calmly do a set of "firmly rejecting and reluctantly accepting the difficult task" with Feng, avoiding the suspicion of seizing power themselves. What is pitiful is that the Reorganization and Western Hills Factions are always being used. Tan Zhen and others have gone to Jin to "respectfully listen to instructions" (Tan Zhen's telegram to Yan contains this phrase), and Yan can "personally impart guidance." Let's talk about Feng's attitude towards the Reorganization and Western Hills Factions. Feng has always been able to use everything, but this time he seems to be somewhat contemptuous of the Reorganization and Western Hills Factions. We only need to look at the time when he used Christianity, he also prayed and read the Bible every day. When he used the Communist Party, he also personally went to Moscow and invited Xu Qian to live across from him, participating in secret matters. And this time, when using the Reorganization and Western Hills Factions, he only sent telegrams and had unimportant second- or third-rate roles (Feng's second- or third-rate roles) Huang Shaogu and others perfunctorily deal with them. As for the opening of the expanded conference and Yan's intentions, how could Feng not know? But in times of military tension, he is happy to let the Reorganization and Western Hills Factions encourage the establishment of a puppet government, to recommend Yan as chairman, and then the pay and ammunition of Feng's troops will also have a place to go. Yan and Feng's attitude towards the Reorganization and Western Hills Factions is like this. What about the Reorganization and Western Hills Factions themselves? They run errands for Yan and Feng, not to devote themselves to Yan and Feng, but in reality they are a group of frustrated politicians. Some are restless and greedy for wealth. Some were relatively law-abiding in the past, but this time they were fooled by others. Therefore, the two factions that were incompatible in the past actually combined, held a conference, issued a declaration, and supported Yan and Feng, acting as accomplices. They may know that Yan and Feng will eventually fail. They may know that relying on Yan and Feng for a living will not last long. It's just that they are too hungry to be picky, so they have to get by. In fact, there is now no so-called Reorganization Faction or so-called Western Hills Faction. These terms are meaningless. It would be better to simply call them the Expanded Faction. The expanded conference is a tool of the feudal warlords. It is a puppet show to seize power for others. From this, one can estimate the value of the middle members of the Expanded Faction. Speaking of this point, I can't help but feel infinitely emotional. Among the members of the Reorganization and Western Hills Factions, there are many people who have a considerable history with the revolution. If they had not gone astray, they could have contributed greatly to society and the country. Even if they had gone astray, if they could turn back in time, the Central Government would be willing to accept them. But unfortunately, they are lost and do not return. When the feudal warlords are making their last struggles and the Central Government is launching a punitive expedition against them, they actually go to great lengths to be sycophantic and sacrifice their many years of revolutionary history and personality. What a pity. The decline of the Reorganization and Western Hills Factions is probably irreversible. It is hoped that all revolutionary comrades will see their decline and encourage themselves more in the future, always unite and not allow any phenomenon of disintegration. Then, even if the revolutionary future is difficult, it will not be difficult to overcome, and the success of the revolution will be hopeful."</p>

<h3 id="e54">Three Routes for the Fujian Army to Suppress the Lu Troops <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Establishes a Temporary Military Affairs Office</p>
<p>And Establishes a Fuzhou Martial Law Command</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: After Chairman Yang returned to Fujian, he has met with Commander-in-Chief Chen and Marshal Liu several times regarding the military suppression of Lu's troops. As a result, the provincial government has increased the establishment of a temporary military affairs office, with Yang Tingying, Chief of Staff of the Army Headquarters, as the director, and Li Guangzhao, Senior Staff Officer of the 56th Division, as the deputy director. Yin Jiaxun, Yang Guangxun, and Zheng Yulin are appointed as advisors. The office is divided into two sections: security and confidential affairs. The security section remains as originally established by the provincial government, while the confidential affairs section is headed by Wang Fu as the section chief, with Shi Leng and others as staff members. In addition, a martial law command is established, jointly headed by Liu Shangzhi and Li Dingzhang, the Brigade Commander and Deputy Brigade Commander of the 167th Brigade of Liu's Division, respectively. Both have already assumed their positions yesterday. The martial law command has also issued martial law regulations. The joint temporary military police office has been abolished. As for the three-pronged deployment for attacking Lu, it is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>Liu's Division's Side: Liu's Division, seeing that Lu's troops are gradually retreating, is preparing to advance. At noon on the 12th, a mortar company and a machine gun company moved from the city to the North Gate and, after spending the night there, proceeded to Xiaobeiling. On the 13th, the 2nd Battalion of the 333rd Regiment of the 167th Brigade followed. The 335th Regiment of the 168th Brigade is deployed from Xiaoling to the vicinity of Hongshan Bridge. The 3rd Battalion of the 333rd Regiment of the 167th Brigade moved from Hongshan Bridge to Xiaobeiling for deployment. The troops on the western route are also advancing upstream from Tongkou Ganche. The 331st Regiment in the rear has completed the renovation of the wartime relics in the Xiaobeiling, Maotou Mountain, and Dafu Ridge areas. In addition to leaving a part of the troops stationed in various high mountains of Xiaobei, they have also been dispatched to the front line. Deputy Division Commander Yan Er'ai is in Nanjing negotiating with the central military authorities to send the newly formed Zhan Brigade to assist in the battle. They are expected to arrive in Fujian soon. It is also said that the Central Zhao Brigade stationed in Zhejiang has been ordered to come to Fujian and is also preparing to depart.</p>
<p>Naval Side: The right wing of the attack on Lu is undertaken by the Marine Corps. Currently, although Lu's troops in the Nan'gang area have retreated from the Shatidi and Milaoshan areas, the Zhu Regiment of Lu Xinming's troops and the Su Qinzi and Wu Da'ang and Li Jinshui factions of Sun Guozhen's troops are still responsible for supplying food locally. Chairman Yang yesterday specifically ordered Lin Shouguo, the Brigade Commander of the 2nd Marine Brigade, to lead Lin Bingzhou's unit of the 3rd Regiment, supplemented by two mountain gun and machine gun battalions, to land at Nan'gang and advance from the side. Commander-in-Chief Chen also personally inspected the Haihu and other gunboats on the morning before yesterday and personally instructed Chen Wenlin, the captain of the air squadron, on the tactics of aerial combat, dispatching seaplanes to cover the Marine Corps' departure from the due south. However, 250 porters are needed, with a porterage fee of 20 yuan per person, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau is instructed to relay this to the police stations No. 1 and No. 5 to recruit them for standby. Lin himself intends to go to the front to command the troops immediately. In addition, the troops of the 2nd Marine Brigade stationed in the province, in Zhongzhou, Guanyin Well, Cangqian Mountain, Xiadu, and north of the bridge in Nantai, as well as in the Taijiang Xun and Bai Ma Wang Temple and Minqing Hall areas of Yazhou, are responsible for the rear defense line. They have now also been ordered to move to Shangbeiling for concentration. The special service company, machine gun company, and mountain gun team originally stationed in the Shijinci and Nan'gang districts are also approved to open provinces for collection, and the defense area left behind Chen Commander-in-Chief Chen has ordered Jin Zhenzhong of the First Brigade to dispatch the Jin Zhensheng Battalion from Funing to the province to take over the Taijiang area first, and it is said that Lin Shouguo intends to ask the First Brigade to draw a battalion from each regiment to go to the front enemy. Lin is to go to Xiamen today to consult with Lin Guogeng, Fang Shengtao, and others on military matters.</p>
<p>Southern Fujian Side: Since Fang Shengtao's return to Fujian this time, it has long been rumored that he will be ordered to command a regiment of Zhang Zhen's division and Xiao Shuxuan's regiment of Chen Guohui's brigade to jointly attack Lu's troops. The provincial government yesterday appointed Fang as a special military commissioner, and both the national and provincial troops in southern Fujian are under his control and dispatch. It is now heard that a part of Zhang Zhen's troops and Xiao's regiment will begin to move out. Chen Guohui will also be stationed in Anxi Xianwan, Penglai, and Yingnei. Approximately 1,000 of his own troops have been transferred to Yongchun for concentration, preparing to be the vanguard in the future attack on Lu. However, at the same time, the issue of Chen Guohui and Gao Jingli competing for the Quanzhou territory and the issue of Chen's troops replenishing supplies and ammunition are still under negotiation.</p>
<p>Summarizing the above situation, the front of Liu's Division and the side of Lin's Brigade will most likely move out first, advancing through the Min and Gu counties. Central troops can also arrive continuously. To quickly resolve the military affairs against Lu's troops, Chairman Yang has changed the airport to the Wangzhuang Agricultural Experiment Field and has printed 10,000 small leaflets urging Lu's troops to return, which were dropped this morning from the Haihu and Haihu aircraft to the positions of Lu's troops upstream. Those who bring a platoon to return will still be appointed as platoon leaders, and those who bring a company to return will still be appointed as company commanders, and so on up to a battalion or regiment, all will be accepted and never implicated. Otherwise, both good and bad will be destroyed, and there will be no chance to regret it, etc. (16th)</p>
<h3 id="e55">Dispute over the Head of Fujian Finance Department <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>He Gonggan Defends Himself as Not Being a Nationalist</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: After Yang Shuzhuang returned to Fujian, in order to reorganize finance, he specifically recommended He Gonggan, the former Secretary-General of the Provincial Government and Salt Transport Envoy, to act as the Director of the Finance Department and Special Financial Commissioner, ordering him to be responsible for maintaining it. The Ministry of Finance approved the telegram and ordered him to take over the position and report it. However, on the day the Ministry's telegram arrived in the province, Gan Yun and Feng Ji'an, two guiding committee members of the Provincial Party Department, strongly opposed He's appointment in the General Memorial Week report and in the articles of the "Republic Daily News," because He had previously handled the "Orphan Army Magazine," which contained nationalist colors. At the same time, a leaflet titled "30 Million People of Fujian" was found in the city, strongly attacking He and favoring Tang Dunbo, the current acting secretary in charge of the Finance Department (Tang has resigned several times due to his inability to maintain the position). This has attracted social attention. Yang Shuzhuang originally intended to follow the telegram from the Finance Ministry and order He to take office on the 18th to ensure that someone would take charge as soon as possible. Upon hearing the news, Gan and Feng notified Chen Shoufan, the Secretary of the Provincial Government, by telephone on the afternoon of the 17th, asking him to persuade Yang Shuzhuang to dissuade him. Yang immediately dispatched Chen Peikun, a member of the Provincial Committee, to the Provincial Party Department to consult with Feng and Gan. As a result, He was ordered to postpone taking office, and the Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government telegraphed the Central National Government to request instructions and wait for a reply before deciding on a solution. However, He Gonggan remained extremely calm. Yesterday, a reporter from a certain newspaper visited He at his private residence and asked for his opinion on the current situation. He replied that whether he is a nationalist is proven by the facts and does not need to be argued. As for the "Orphan Army Magazine," it was initiated by Chen Chengze, bringing together scholars from various factions to publish their political views in writing. Therefore, Zhou Fo Hai, Luo Jialun, Shi Weihuan, Zeng Qi, Guo Moruo, and others have contributed. Later, due to differences in opinion, it disintegrated, and the magazine was also discontinued. There have been more than just this one attack on me for being a nationalist. When I served as the Director of the Propaganda Department in 1927, some people also pointed out that I and Liu Wendao, the Deputy Director of the Political Department at the time, were both Nationalists.</p>

<p>On May 11, the Central Political Conference specifically proposed this case for review. Hu Hanmin was the chairman on that day, and Chiang Kai-shek, Chen Mingshu, Wu Zhihui, and Xiao Focheng were among those present. As a result, it was resolved that neither I nor Comrade Liu had any relationship with the Nationalist faction and were all loyal comrades, etc. Generally, this matter can only be resolved after the Central Government's reply arrives.

<h3 id="e56">Fierce Battle Between Quanzhou Militia and Gao's Troops <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Since Lu Xingbang's rebellion and the transfer of the 56th Division's Chen Wantai Brigade stationed in Quanzhou to the province, Quanzhou has been taken over by Gao Weiguo's guerrilla brigade. Gao is a compilation of bandits from Nan'an and Hui'an counties. Recently, he has been collecting funds from Jinjiang and Nan'an counties, leading to a joint resistance by the militia of the two counties. They attacked Quanzhou city on the night of the 10th and withdrew on the 11th. For several days, Gao's troops and the militia have been facing off. The number of militiamen continuing to gather has reached over 1,000. They attacked the city again on the 17th, but were defeated and retreated.</p>
<p>Earlier, Gao collected funds from various villages. He collected 20,000 yuan each from the three villages of Qingmang, Xialian, and Chendian outside the Xinmen Gate of Quanzhou City. The village of Shudou, which has many overseas Chinese, is the richest, and he collected 50 catties of 10-yuan banknotes from the Bank of China (approximately 80,000 to 90,000 yuan) and detained more than 40 residents of the village, limiting the four villages to hand over the funds within three days. The militia of each village was greatly angered and unanimously decided to resist. One day before the deadline, the militia of Qingmang, Xialian, Chendian, and Shudou in the southern district of the outer city, approximately 600 people, gathered together. In the afternoon of the 10th, more than 100 people, dressed in plain clothes and carrying short guns, disguised themselves as gamblers and vendors and infiltrated Quanzhou city through the Xinxi and Liangmen gates. At the appointed time, they coordinated from within. At about 11 o'clock that night, another 400 people in plain clothes, each carrying a rifle, advanced in three routes towards the Xinmen, Ximen, and Nanmen gates. Shudou is only 10 li away from the city and arrived before midnight. More than 100 people from each of the three routes first attacked the gates. Gao's troops guarding the city had only one platoon at Ximen, and all were disarmed. A company at Xinmen was caught off guard and disarmed more than 20 and killed or wounded more than 10. A company stationed at the Xinqiaowei station at Nanmen was also killed two soldiers, wounded seven or eight people, and seized more than 10 guns. All three routes were unprepared, and Gao's troops suffered heavy losses. The militia then advanced towards the city. At about 12 o'clock at midnight, the plainclothes team inside the city responded and cut through the gates, entering the city in three routes. The city was in an uproar. Gao Weiguo and his subordinates stationed in various places did not know the enemy's strength and, moreover, it was late at night, so they dared not fight and hurriedly withdrew from the North Gate. The militia entered the city and searched everywhere. When they arrived at Gao's headquarters in the Xin Ya at about 1:30 in the morning, it was about 3:00 in the morning, and the sky was about to dawn. The militia retreated out of the city, gathering at Xinqiao and Fuqiao, and retreating towards Shudou. The sky was not yet bright when they left, because the Shudou and Xin District militia were impulsive this time and had no contact with other villages in advance. They feared that Gao's troops would counterattack at dawn and it would be difficult to defend without reinforcements. In this battle, Gao's troops were killed 50 or 60 people and more than 90 rifles and two machine guns were seized. Gao Weiguo retreated to Wu Bu Camp and Xiajing outside the North Gate to gather his troops. He learned that the attackers were militia and not many in number. At about 5:00 at dawn, he returned to the city through the North Gate and conducted a major search for the insiders. Three militia soldiers who had fallen behind were captured, all of whom were northerners, and beheaded. Also, because the Mauser company of his troops were all northerners and had defected to the militia, he searched for northerners in the city, and more than 30 were killed. Desheng and Mingde money shops opened by Shudou villagers on South Street were robbed of more than 20,000 yuan, and more than 10 shopkeepers were arrested and sent to Gao's hometown of Fushanyao. Chen Zhengjia, a doctor at Wenling Hospital, was beheaded because he had a private telephone with Shudou Village for medical treatment, and Gao suspected that he had notified Shudou that the city was unprepared, leading them to attack the city. On the 11th, 12th, and 13th, Quanzhou City was a world of terror, with people being killed, houses burned, and looted. Those who fled to Xiamen were continuous. Quanzhou City was completely closed on the 11th and 12th. On the 13th, Gao ordered the shops to open, but no one dared to respond. The Quanzhou-Anhai bus service was completely interrupted on the 11th and 12th and only resumed on the 13th. After this incident occurred, the militia of Jinjiang and Nan'an counties formed a major alliance. On the 12th, they telegraphed the province, "Sent to the Provincial Party Department, the Provincial Government, Chairman Yang, Division Commander Liu, He Ding, Commander Chen, and Ji Liang for review: Since Gao Weiguo was stationed in Quanzhou, he has been collecting funds and loans harshly, and abducting people up to 40 at a time, disturbing the people to the extreme. Recently, he has even intensified his efforts, coercing Shudou Village, which has many merchants doing business in Surabaya and is known to be wealthy, to hand over 50 catties of banknotes. Yesterday, the villagers, unable to bear the pressure, resisted and sought survival in death. Now everyone is in danger. Please quickly send formal troops to Quanzhou to be stationed and appease the people. If you cannot immediately find a way to relieve the people, we will unite and save ourselves by fighting the bandits. We also ask for the supply of bullets and practical support. The telegram is extremely urgent." The joint militia of the Nan District, Xin District, Shudou District, Qingyang District, Shishi District, Yamenkou District, Yongning District, Tanying District, Guanqiao District, Shuitou District, and Lianshi District of Jinjiang County, at the same time, the Jinjiang County Party Department also telegraphed the province, "Sent to the Provincial Party Department, the Provincial Government, Chairman Yang, Division Commander Liu, and Commander Chen for review: The bandit Gao is stationed in Quanzhou, looting, extorting, abusing, and killing without a day of rest, and the people are displaced. Recently, he has intensified his efforts and coerced Shudou Village to hand over 50 catties of banknotes. In one day, he abducted dozens of residents of the outer city. His cruelty has aroused the resistance of the people. The day Gao's troops and the people fought fiercely, and the killings were tragic. Today, he also abducted and killed more than 30 innocent northerners in the city. Now the order in Quanzhou City is in chaos, and the lives of the people cannot be protected. Please quickly send elite troops to severely punish and suppress them to relieve the suffering." The Jinjiang County Party Department.</p>
<p>On the 13th, Gao sent troops to station in Qingyang again and sent a team to attack Shudou, but on the same day, the militia from Shishi, Yongning, and Yamenkou in the Jinjiang Nanmen area also gathered in Shishi, divided into five teams, including a rifle team and a plainclothes pistol team, approximately 400 people, advanced to Qingyang on the 14th. Gao hurriedly withdrew the troops from Anhai and Qingyang back to Quanzhou, and the team attacking Shudou also withdrew halfway. By the 16th, the militia in Qingyang had advanced to Dongshan Village, only two or three li away from the Nanmen of Quanzhou. At present, the militia outside Nanmen has gathered six teams, approximately 600 people, from Dongshan Village to Anhai and Yongning, all under their control. The militia and Shudou and other villages outside Xinmen have also gathered 600 people, and these two sides each have a reserve team of 400 or 500 people. The meeting on the 16th decided to attack the city again. In the early morning of the 17th, the militia on the Nanmen side was in charge of two routes. One route, led by the commander Huang Jinyan, attacked the Nanmen with more than 300 people. The deputy commander Xu Wenqi led more than 200 people to attack Tumen. The militia of 400 people from Shudou and other villages outside Xinmen, led by Jiang Guangtie and Xie Guanghui, attacked the Xinmen and Ximen. At about 3:00 in the morning before dawn, the three routes launched a fierce attack, and the fighting continued until about 7:00 in the morning. The militia led by Huang Jinyan had rushed to the Xinqiao at the Nanmen entrance. Gao's troops retreated into the city, and Huang feared that Gao had an ambush, so he dared not enter immediately. At about 9:00, Gao transferred a large team of reinforcements from Honglai to counterattack out of the city. The fighting continued until 10:00, Huang was no match and retreated to Dongshan Village. Xu Wenqi, who attacked Tumen, had broken into the city to the Tianhou Palace. Because the Nanmen retreated, he also withdrew immediately. At the Xinmen and Ximen, Gao first burned and cut off trees, and also withdrew at the same time. At present, the militia is preparing for a third attack. (July 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e57">Conflict Between Bandit Troops and Red Spear Society in Jiaoxian <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: The bandit troops entrenched in Jiaoxian know that they are not tolerated by the people. They have repeatedly sent people to Han Fuju to request that they be reorganized and incorporated into the Second Mixed Brigade of the First Army Corps, and that the bandit leader Ji Xiaoxi be appointed as the brigade commander. Ji has already issued a telegram on the 16th to take office. Unexpectedly, after being reorganized by the Han army, these bandits thought they had become formal troops, extorting and looting even more than before. On the 16th, the bandit leader Sun Hanchen, currently serving as the commander of the bandit army group, led dozens of bandits to the southern villages of Jiaoxian, extorting money from each village under the pretext of collecting tobacco taxes. When they reached the vicinity of Shiwulikuang, they happened to meet the local Red Spear Society, and a conflict broke out between the two sides. After several hours of fierce fighting, seven people were killed and several injured on the Red Spear Society side. The bandit leader Sun Hanchen was also stabbed several times and was rescued back to the city by the bandits. Not long after, he died of his injuries. The bandits were greatly angered and emptied the city on the 17th to avenge Sun. They surrounded the villages near Shiwulikuang, intending to gather and kill. The bandits were powerful. After only a few hours of fighting, the Red Spear Society was defeated and retreated to the rear. Women and children who were unable to escape in time were tragically killed. The bandits returned to the city in victory and dismembered the four captured members of the Red Spear Society to offer as sacrifices to Sun Bandit's spirit. After the Red Spear Society's tragic defeat, they were saddened by the destruction of their homes and the slaughter of their wives and children, so they sought help from all the villages. The militia of each village was also deeply afraid of being affected by the cruelty of the bandit army. For the sake of self-defense, they will unite the militia of the entire county, attack the county seat, and fight the bandits to the death. They are currently in the process of carrying out this plan. The bandit side is also on high alert. They have tightly closed the four gates and driven all the merchants and residents of the city to the city walls to defend, while the bandits take turns resting. According to refugees who escaped from Jiaoxian City, the bandit army is currently extorting 20,000 yuan from the gentry and merchants in the city to prepare for Sun Bandit's memorial service. Sun Bandit has been embalmed, and the coffin used is the burial object of the mother of Wang, the richest man in Jiaoyi, worth more than a thousand yuan. The bandits have driven the merchants and residents to defend the city, leaving only women in their homes. The bandits enter and leave the people's homes at will, and forcibly rape those who are slightly attractive. Jiaoxian City is now in a deep and hot place. I hope the officials will save them.

<h3 id="e58">Investigation of the Black Mountain Snake Fossil <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>After the discovery of snake fossils in Black Mountain, Hanyang, the Academia Sinica, upon receiving a letter from the Hanyang Municipal Engineering Bureau requesting the dispatch of personnel for research, immediately sent Shu Wenbo, an assistant researcher at the Institute of Geology of the Academia Sinica, to Hanyang the day before yesterday. At 10:00 yesterday morning, Chen Pengguan, a technician from the Engineering Bureau, along with Xiang Dao and others, accompanied Shu by car to Black Mountain to conduct an on-site investigation. A reporter from the Riri News Company, believing that this matter was of great value in scientific research,</p>
<p>also went to observe with them. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>General Situation of Black Mountain: Black Mountain, formerly known as He Mountain, is located about three li northwest of Hanyang, with the Yangtze River behind it to the north. It stands opposite Turtle and Snake Mountains. It is about one li in circumference and about seven or eight zhang in height. According to legend, this mountain once collapsed during the Tang Dynasty, so the quarrying of stones has been prohibited throughout history, but this cannot be verified.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Fossil: From the foot of the mountain to the mountainside, stones with fish scale patterns can be found, winding to the top of the mountain. However, most of them have been destroyed by the stone workers, leaving only their discontinuous remnants. The excavated fossil is three sides, and the fish scale pattern is extremely clear. Shu's Remarks: Black Mountain in Hanyang is a slightly metamorphic sandstone layer, similar to Snake Mountain in Wuchang, and belongs to the "Jurassic Period." When the city of Hanyang was quarrying stones in Black Mountain, fossils were found with a diameter of two to three inches and obvious scales. Everyone thought they were insects, but since the rock layer of the mountain is Jurassic and leaf fossils have also been found, shaped like fans or light, the so-called insect is not accurate. It seems to be the remains of a tree trunk. It is planned to move this stone to a detailed research institute, and the age of the rock layer of the mountain can be determined. I still need to go to Black Mountain again within a few days to conduct a second investigation. (Riri News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e59">Sharp Decline in Revenue of South Manchuria Railway After Joint Transportation of Four Routes in Northeast <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Exceeded 4 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: After the implementation of joint transportation by the four state-owned railways in Northeast China, the price of gold soared. The passenger and freight fares of Chinese railways are still calculated in silver dollars, which is more than half the price of South Manchuria Railway trains. Therefore, all passenger and freight transportation that is not absolutely necessary has been switched to state-owned railways. In addition, recently, the Beining Railway has been newly painted, decorated, and renovated for all levels of vehicles. Its cleanliness and safety are no less than that of South Manchuria Railway trains. With cheap prices and high quality, not only Chinese people are happy to take them, but foreigners also praise them. Therefore, the business of each road has suddenly become active, and it is quite overwhelmed. As a result, the South Manchuria Railway is showing a state of decline, and its revenue has sharply declined. Although the South Manchuria Railway authorities are trying to find ways to remedy this, it is impossible to save it in fact due to the continued increase in the price of gold. According to the temporary statistics released by the South Manchuria Railway Survey Division, the business income as of the 7th of this month has decreased compared with the income in the same period last year. The amount of the decrease is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Income as of the 6th of this month - Income in the same period last year - Comparison Increase or Decrease</p>
<p>22.94 - 26.96 - 4.023.</p>
<p>6.845 - 9.958 - 113 yuan</p>
<p>yuan yuan</p>
<p>Income as of the 7th of this month - Income in the same period last year - Comparison Increase or Decrease</p>
<p>23.11 - 27.19 - 4.077.</p>
<p>8.370 - 6.293 - 923 yuan</p>
<p>yuan yuan</p>
<p>Looking at the above table, the business of the South Manchuria Railway is indeed showing a very large decrease and is getting worse. It is clear at a glance that the amount of the decrease has already exceeded 4 million yuan. If the state-owned railways in Northeast China can take the opportunity to continue to improve and seek to regain their rights and interests, they can achieve twice the result with half the effort. The future decrease in revenue of the South Manchuria Railway is unknown, which is enough to attract general attention. The results of the income as of the 7th of this month compared with the same period last year are analyzed and listed again as follows:</p>
<p>Comparison of Business Income as of the 7th of this Month with the Same Period Last Year</p>
<p>Passenger Transport Decrease in Income 1,444,104 yuan</p>
<p>Decrease in Passengers 763,359 people</p>
<p>Freight Transport Decrease in Income 2,50,574 yuan</p>
<p>Decrease in Goods 439.23 tons</p>
<p>Warehouses and Others Decrease in Income 113,245 yuan</p>
<p>Total Decrease 4,077,923 yuan (July 15)</p>
<h3 id="e60">Jiangsu Province Penalizes Late Payment of Rush Tribute <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Restoration of Cases Before 1916</p>
<p>In Jiangsu Province, fines for late payment of rush tribute have been collected. Since the first year of the Republic, the original deadline was two months for completion of payment. Overdue payments were subject to an additional 10% penalty. In 1916, the Provincial Assembly resolved to change it to an additional 20% after the two-month deadline, followed by another two-month extension, after which an additional 10% would be charged. This has been implemented since the upper rush in 1917 and has not changed until now. The Department of Finance now believes that the levy of rush tribute in Jiangsu Province is late, and the regulation of a two-month deadline is appropriate. However, the issue of late payment fines has caused obstacles to the levy. Moreover, the levy of lower rush tribute cannot be started early due to the autumn survey. After the initial and subsequent deadlines, the year has ended. Therefore, less than half of the collection is completed at the time of cutoff, which is bound to be included in old debts and may even be lost after a long time. After careful consideration, it is necessary to restore the old cases before 1916. It is specially requested that the provincial government, starting from the 19th year, impose an additional penalty of 10% after two months from the start of the levy and order a simple procedure for late payment fines to warn against fatigue. This has been approved by the Provincial Committee. The summary is recorded as follows: (1) The counties should collect rush tribute and reed taxes in accordance with the cases before 1916, and the deadline shall be two months from the date of commencement of the levy. Overdue payments shall be subject to an additional 10% late payment fine. (2) Starting from the upper rush levy in the 19th year, after deducting two months, the penalty shall be implemented, and no extension shall be allowed for any reason. (3) The additional penalty shall be limited to the regular provincial and county taxes, and various additional taxes collected shall not be penalized. (4) Two months after the start of the levy, each county shall clearly demarcate the various items of rush tribute and reed tax that have been collected, cut off the numbers, and report them for inspection. (5) This fine shall be fully used for provincial use in accordance with the cases before 1916, and the counties shall not retain it. (6) The old system of charging an additional 20% for the initial two-month deadline and an additional 10% for the subsequent two-month deadline shall be abolished immediately. (7) One month after the penalty period, if the payment is not made, the payment shall be ordered to be recovered.</p>

<p>Wuhu City Police Chief Yu Mingxun has been ordered to transfer to the province. The vacancy will be filled by Tang Shaogao. Tang is currently the Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Provincial Government and will arrive in Wuhu to take office in the coming days. However, various sectors in Wuhu are concerned that during Yu's tenure, he levied an additional 20% surcharge on shop and residential property rentals. He purchased 51 automatic box-type pistols, 25,000 rounds of ammunition, 25 Browning pistols, 5,000 rounds of ammunition, 4 German rifles, 3 Hubei-made rifles, and 18 bicycles. These were originally purchased with local public funds for local public security. To prevent future loss, a meeting was held yesterday at the Public Security Bureau to discuss storage methods. It was decided that the city and county Party headquarters, the municipal preparatory office, the county government, the general chamber of commerce, and the county education bureau would jointly manage the equipment. The Public Security Bureau will issue a receipt for the borrowed items, and the words "Wuhu City" will be branded on them. A report will also be submitted to the provincial government for record-keeping. No one will be allowed to remove the items in the future.</p>
<p>The Provincial Federation of Commerce and the Wuhu Sundries Guild are opposing the sugar tax and the newly appointed Director-General of the Sugar Tax Bureau, Gao Peide. Due to the unfavorable situation, Gao has returned to Beijing from Wuhu. Currently, the Sundries Guild reports that the sugar tax has recently been intensified, with an import tax of 1.3 taels and an export tax of 0.67 taels. The sugar tax has also been increased to over one yuan. The guild has petitioned the Anhui Financial Commissioner's Office to abolish it completely. In addition to petitioning the central government, the Provincial Federation of Commerce has sent telegrams to 60 county chambers of commerce throughout the province, urging them to work together to fight against the tax.</p>
<p>The Wuhu County Government has been ordered to establish a public property clearing committee. It has been decided that one representative from the county Party headquarters, the county government, the financial management office, the education bureau, the defense corps, and each autonomous region will form the committee. The committee is expected to complete the clearing within one month and hand it over to the financial management office for management. However, educational properties are not included in this process.</p>
<p>Recent weather in southern Anhui has been favorable for agriculture, and a good harvest is expected. Stored rice in the countryside is being transported to the city for sale. Rice prices have fallen from about seventeen yuan to about fourteen yuan in the past two weeks. The price stabilization committee is now planning to conclude the operations of the various price stabilization bureaus.</p>
<p>The Anhui Financial Commissioner's Office will hold a meeting of all likin bureau chiefs on the 21st to reorganize the likin tax collection. The bureau chiefs are arriving in Wuhu. Financial Commissioner Lou Fu returned to Wuhu from Beijing yesterday to attend the meeting. (19th)</p>

<p>Ke Guanyin, the Executive Committee Member of the County Education Association and Mayor of Guyang Town, has been dismissed due to mental illness. Previously, he was arrested for commissioning Gu Wenbao's engraving shop to forge the official seal of the Education Bureau. The county government held a hearing on the 21st morning. Ke Guanyin confessed that the seal of the Education Bureau was blurred and needed to be re-engraved, which had been decided at the previous meeting. Observing his speech and demeanor, the presiding judge, Du Cheng, suspected that he was suffering from mental illness. He asked Director Feng of Songjiang Hospital to examine him in court. The examination confirmed that he was suffering from mental disorder, and a certificate was filed. The defendant also admitted that he was addicted to alcohol and had been suffering from mental disorder for several years. The judge reprimanded him and released him in court. The defendant was escorted home by his family and is reportedly going to Hangzhou for treatment. The first rice distribution of the Price Stabilization Bureau has been prepared and started today (21st). The city belongs to the first district, which has a vast territory and a large population. For the convenience of the poor, eight distribution points have been set up. According to statistics, there are 16,099 large households and 7,893 small households in the eight distribution points, and the daily rice consumption is 20,045.5 catties.

<p>Detailed Report on the Incident Involving Wounded Soldiers and the Subsequent Martial Law and the Cracking Down on Communists. The situation, which involved wounded soldiers causing trouble, the declaration of martial law, and the arrest of communists, was resolved yesterday (21st). A detailed report follows: On the evening of the 18th, at 8 PM, the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau received a tip that foreign communists Zhu Jicheng and Wang Guangming were active on Changmen Road. Patrol Officer Zhang Shousong was dispatched to investigate the Zhonghua Hotel. He found Zhu Jicheng in Room 81 on the third floor. Zhang immediately opened a room near Room 81 and instructed the tea boy to inform him if anyone called for Zhu. After a while, a call came. Zhang answered, but the other party did not recognize his voice as Zhu's and refused to say what it was about, then hung up. After investigation, the call was found to have come from Room 27 of the Xinxin Hotel. Knowing the whereabouts of the group, Zhang rushed back to the bureau and dispatched Flying Squad Patrol Chief Liu Zhanmin to lead a team to arrest Zhu. He also reported to the joint military-police-group investigation office, which sent a team to search the Xinxin Hotel. Wang Guangming, Xu Yuanzhang, and eleven wounded soldiers were arrested in Rooms 19, 20, and 29. Eighty-eight small flags and symbols were found in the rooms. After being taken to the investigation office, they confessed that they planned to seize weapons from the military and police, then set fire to the prison and occupy Suzhou City, with the riot scheduled for 10 AM on the 19th. They were detained for further investigation. The director of the bureau reported to the county government, which forwarded the report to both Beijing and Shanghai for instructions. On the evening of the 19th, the commander of the Third Regiment of the Guard Brigade, Shi Juemin, received a call from the capital's brigade headquarters, stating that Beijing had learned of the communists' planned riot in Suzhou on that day and instructed him to be prepared and to close the city gates early at 9 AM. Commander Shi was preparing to comply when a disturbance occurred outside the city. Previously, at around 5 PM, Battalion Commander Lou Yue of the Second Battalion of the Guard Brigade was returning from outside the city in a car when he saw dozens of wounded soldiers armed with iron bars and knives lurking in Ciyi Lane behind the General Post Office. Seeing Lou pass by alone, they verbally abused him and surrounded him. Lou, realizing the danger, got out of the car and used one hand to push the car forward for cover while using the other to threaten them with a pistol. The crowd did not retreat and continued to attack with weapons. Lou fired a shot, hitting one person in the leg. The others became even more violent, knowing that Battalion Commander Lou did not have many bullets. One wounded soldier struck Lou on the head with a heavy iron bar. Lou quickly fired another shot, hitting the attacker in the right side, and the bar fell to the ground. Lou then took the opportunity to escape to the Daxin Hotel. More than a hundred wounded soldiers surrounded the Daxin Hotel. Fortunately, the investigation office arrived and the crowd dispersed. On the 20th, all the guards outside Changmen Gate went on strike. On the morning of the 21st, the 17th Rear Hospital was surrounded. The instructor and the transportation battalion were responsible for sealing off the area and setting up machine guns at key points near the hospital. The Public Security Bureau's Flying Squad, the 4th Police Company of the County, and the Merchant Corps were responsible for patrol and security. Guard Battalion Commander Zhou Wenbin led a team to the hospital to distribute discharge pay of five yuan to each of the 400 lightly wounded and recovered wounded soldiers. They were divided into groups and taken to the station, where they boarded 15 vehicles and left for Nanjing at 1 PM. (About 40 people escaped along the way to Wangting when the vehicles stopped). There are still hundreds of wounded in the 17th Hospital, but they are all seriously wounded, so the area is no longer dangerous. It is reported that the decision to discharge the troublemaking wounded soldiers from Suzhou was made by officials from various agencies at the joint investigation office the day before (20th).</p>

<p>Yesterday was the second day of the 10th Annual Meeting of the China Vocational Education Society and the 7th Annual Meeting of the National Federation of Vocational Education Organizations. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e85">(I) Vocational Guidance Group Meeting <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Vocational Guidance Group (Group Four) meeting was held yesterday at 8:00 AM. Attendees included Zhong Daozan, Zheng Tonghe, Wang Diancun, Shen Youqian, Pan Yangyao, Fan Baohua, Yang Zhefu, Zhang Ying, Yang Xishi, Chao Sun Dingchen, Chen Bokui, Zheng Chunian, Huang Jingwan, Chen Qingshi, Li Banghe, Li Wen Yue, Wang Tianmin, Liao Nancai, Li Xiaobai, Xu Shouqian, Wang Wenbin of the Wu County Vocational Guidance Center, and Lu Linxun of the Jiading Vocational Guidance Center.

<h3 id="e86">Reports <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Pan Yangyao (Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center): The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center was established in September of the 16th year. At that time, the affairs were quite simple, but the work has become increasingly tight to this day. Vocational counseling is especially prevalent, averaging 40 people per day. In addition to services and guidance for further education and employment, attention must also be paid to health and legal aspects. Therefore, health and legal guidance have been recently added. As for vocational placement, statistics show that 300 people register each month, and one-tenth are successfully placed. Moreover, there are many schools in Shanghai with business-like qualities and unscrupulous correspondence schools, so a guide to further education has been compiled to serve as a compass. This is a review of the opening of our organization. Furthermore, the education and vocational sectors have been out of touch for several years, so most institutions and companies do not like to use vocational school graduates. Now, various agencies have gradually gained faith in graduates above the secondary level. Recently, central departments and construction agencies in various localities, as well as banks, factories, and shops, have entrusted our organization to find vocational school graduates, especially engineering students, which is the most needed. Since our establishment, Nanjing, Jiading, Wuxi, and Wu County have also successively organized, gradually drawing the attention of the community. The current trend in the vocational sector should pay attention to industry, so we vigorously promote the study of industry to students to prepare them for local needs. In the future, vocational guidance intends to pay attention to psychological testing, vocational analysis, and aptitude and interests, which is currently being researched and carried out.</p>
<p>Dr. Zhong Daozan: Vocational guidance is of great importance to the future of young people. Due to political circumstances, the Fujian Vocational Guidance Center has not been able to fully implement its set policies, but it is gratifying that it is gradually rising up everywhere.</p>
<p>Fan Baohua (University of Shanghai): The purpose of vocational guidance at our school is twofold: (1) University students do not know which department is suitable when they first enter the school, and they do not know how to serve after graduation. In view of this, our school has listed vocational guidance as a compulsory subject (half a year). This course is designed for first-year university students and is taught by President Liu every week for one hour. On the one hand, it provides theoretical and experiential teaching, and on the other hand, it leads students to visit industrial organizations for reference. In addition, classroom work is not very practical, so a vocational guidance department is set up to bring society and schools closer together. Since the students' circumstances and personalities are different, if guidance is not given, graduates often work in agencies that do not match their studies, and students who have not graduated often feel that they lack interest in what they are learning. Therefore, in addition to contacting various agencies to inquire about students, my brother and President Liu must gather students for discussion for one hour every week. This method has been tested for two years and is very interesting. Therefore, I believe that vocational guidance is very important and should be included in the curriculum so that students will not go astray in the future.</p>
<p>Dr. Shen Gongjian: Vocational guidance should first focus on psychological testing, so attention should be paid to students' interests, environment, and habits. We hope that in the future, scientific methods will be used to make the theory and practice consistent, such as filling out forms and talking. This matter is difficult to see results in a short time, but it will eventually achieve its purpose. American testing can be used as a standard.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiongfei (Jiaxing County Commercial School): The Vocational Placement Committee of our school has been established for a year, but the results are not good. One reason is that the local community does not have confidence in junior high school graduates, and the other reason is that junior high school graduates do not bother to learn business. It is now planned to contact the business community so that graduates can intern in stores for one month before graduation.</p>
<p>Wang Tianmin (Shaanxi Xiyuan Vocational School): Our school has compiled guides to further education</p>
<p>Zheng Xigu (Principal of Shanghai Middle School): Our school handles vocational guidance in two ways: internal and external. (1) The school organizes a guidance department. There are three points of guidance: A. Academic Guidance; B. Guidance for Further Education or Employment; C. Service Guidance. The spirit of teacher-student cooperation is very good. (2) The external level is quite difficult because teachers are busy, especially in Shanghai. For example, I am too busy to respond to entrustments and those who entrust, which wastes a lot of time. I think it is appropriate to set up more vocational guidance centers so that the various guidance centers can jointly handle affairs to ensure that the supplier and the demander benefit each other. After finishing the report, the chairman said that old habits are deeply rooted in the interior. Even if the graduates in the school have good results, it is useless. If the school caters to society, it will fail, but if it is not compatible, it will also fail. Therefore, the chairman advocates creating or improving occupations and asks the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center to be the guide for vocational guidance centers in various places.</p>
<p>Zhang Yingchao (Shengtze Qunyu Pavilion): I have been running the Qunyu Pavilion in Shengtze for many years and have set up a library, museum, and after-work entertainment department to give young people in the business community the opportunity to study. In recent years, various bad habits in Shanghai have been almost completely transferred to the mainland business community, resulting in more and more unemployed people. It is now planned to run a vocational guidance center to provide relief.</p>

<p>Chen Bokui (Shanghai Library): When Zheng Ren was running the Library Association, someone asked if the organization and equipment had been trained to run it. I think that running a vocational school in the near future is one of the new occupations.</p>
<p>Zheng Chunian (West District Elementary School): To solve the difficulties of vocational guidance: (1) arouse interest with testing methods; (2) the school must bear the responsibility of transforming society.</p>
<p>Xu Shouqian (Nanjing Vocational Guidance Center): Advocates opening vocational guidance personnel training schools and short-term training courses.</p>
<p>Lu Linxun (Jiading Vocational Guidance Center): During the summer vacation, he went to 15 elementary schools to guide 302 children and found that more people went to further education than employment, more people went to ordinary schools than vocational schools, and more people learned business than engineering. I strongly advocate guiding children to learn direct production industry.</p>
<p>Li Wenbai (Shaanxi Vocational School): Vocational guidance should be trained according to local conditions and time, and should not cater to students' preferences.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Discussion Proposals <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>(1) Proposal to organize a joint vocational guidance organization (submitted by the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center). It was resolved to pass the original proposal. It was assumed that the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center would draft the charter and schedule a conference of various vocational guidance organizations.</p>
<p>(2) Proposal to promote library vocational guidance (Shanghai Library Association). It was resolved to amend and pass the original proposal.</p>
<p>(3) Proposal to promote guidance based on test results (Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center). It was resolved to pass the original proposal. It was recommended that Wang Diancun, Chen Qingshi, Pan Yangyao, Xu Shouqian, and Li Banghe be added to sort out and summarize the following methods: (1) Education administrative agencies in various provinces, cities, and counties should establish vocational guidance personnel training institutes to train vocational guidance talents. (2) Universities, schools, and high schools should establish vocational guidance departments or vocational guidance committees. In addition to experts, leaders from the industry should be invited to join the guidance to facilitate consultation and assistance. (3) Elementary schools should pay attention to guidance for further education and career selection. The local education bureau or vocational guidance center should send experienced personnel to each school to implement guidance and accurately compile statistics. (4) Vocational guidance centers in various places should open more vocational skills training classes according to local needs to train specialized talents. After graduation, the center will be responsible for introducing services so that all sectors can use their talents. In the future, there will be a firm belief in the people introduced by the vocational guidance center. (5) Methods of communication between the education sector and the vocational sector: (A) The education sector should train more specialized talents and cultivate students' moral character and good habits to supply the vocational sector so that it has deep trust and welcome for the students introduced by the vocational guidance center. (B) The education sector should study and improve the academic contribution of agriculture, industry, and commerce to the vocational sector, support the progress of its business, connect feelings, and help each other (such as improving the silk industry, rescuing gold and silver, and improving agricultural production, etc.). (6) Vocational analysis is the basis for the implementation of vocational guidance. Local vocational guidance agencies should conduct a practical survey of local occupations and compile reports to facilitate the process. (7) Experts should be gathered to study vocational psychological testing and compile various vocational testing materials as a basis for implementing vocational guidance. (8) Vocational guidance centers should provide timely assistance and guidance to various needs in the business community. If they obtain their feelings, candidates, interns, and staff will definitely come to entrust them to handle the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e89">(II) Agricultural Education and Rural Education Group <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Agricultural Education and Rural Education Group (Group Two) held a meeting. More than 30 attendees included Huang Qisheng, Yao Huiquan, Huang Renzhi, Huai Boming, Song Longtian, Yin Qingtang, Zhang Luquan, Zhang Yuanzhang, Xu Kaiyuan, Zhou Mingyi, Xu Jingren, Shi Jiali, Sun Fang, Cao Fengxiang, Yao Minghui, Fan Yin Shen, Wu Wenkui, Jin Baocheng, Shen Tingfang, Shen Suwen, Shen Xinqing, Liao Jianan, Wang Lin, etc. The meeting was chaired by Zhang Luquan and recorded by Gu Junquan. First, the chairman reported that there were four proposals for this group. Please discuss them in order.</p>
<p>(1) Revise the implementation standards of the rural improvement experimental implementation plan based on several years of experience (proposed by the China Vocational Education Society). The chairman explained that the draft standard was originally formulated by the China Vocational Education Society. Now it is revised based on experience and submitted to this meeting for discussion. The content is very detailed, with a total of 15 items. Now we can discuss them one by one. The public agreed and began to read the first article. Then Huang Renzhi reported on the origin and process of formulating the draft. The conclusion was that we believe that it is impossible to talk about education if we leave the countryside. We must improve it based on its environment and needs, etc. Huang Qisheng thought that the phrase "education as a means" in item 6 A was inappropriate and advocated modification. Huang Renzhi agreed and explained the work that should be done in the countryside, such as light-interest lending, medicine, and medical treatment, etc., all of which must be based on livelihood. Huang Qisheng, the director, changed the item to "Start with education, with farmers as the main body and livelihood as the center." Shen Suwen advocated deleting the word "education." Yao Huiquan advocated that the word "education" must be retained and the word "means" can be modified appropriately, and explained that the so-called education is broad. Our society advocates the unity of wealth and education, so we should implement education in all aspects to increase the knowledge of the rural people and relieve their suffering, etc. Huang Renzhi agreed and proposed specific amendments to the article "All improvement undertakings are centered on education, and assisting in solving livelihood problems is the starting method," and explained that education is everywhere and must be absolutely linked to life. On the one hand, improvement undertakings solve the livelihood problems of each villager, and on the other hand, they still need to solve the public economy of the village. We should not create a beautiful environment for the village, plant flowers and plants, and use music to make it colorful, and then compile simple songs so that everyone can easily learn to sing, so that young children can cultivate their character in this environment and be qualified to be villagers and citizens in the future, etc. The whole body agreed to pass the amendment. Huang Qisheng, the main deletion of the word "Anping" in the seventh article Anle and Qin Anping Yao Huiquan explained that Kang Le and Qin refer to spiritual Anping, which is not the same as the formal meaning. Huang Renzhi and Shen Xinqing "advocated that there is no need to modify it. The chairman paid for the vote, and the result was not modified. Shen Xinqing, the main deletion of the three words "front line" in Item C, Fourth Item of Article 9. The whole body agreed. In Article 9, Item A, Tenth Item, the two words "but to" were changed to the word "such as." All other articles were passed according to the original draft without any objections. It was also discussed that the whole case would be submitted to the plenary meeting for discussion tomorrow morning. Secondly, the chairman proposed that members introduce each other. Everyone agreed that each person would register on their own and briefly describe their resume. Later, the chairman introduced Zhou Mingyi to give a speech on the situation of the Suiyuan New Agricultural Experimental Site. The words are omitted. The rest (2) Proposal to improve rural education (proposed by Lu Shaoji) Yao Huiquan mainly handed over the matter to the Vocational Education Society for reference. The chairman voted, and it was passed without objection. (3) Please add a sales office for high-quality seeds to your society (proposed by Biao Boming). Yao Huiming explained that in addition to the new agricultural tool promotion office, the society's rural service department has also started to promote high-quality seeds. It seems that this proposal does not need to be established. The chairman voted, and it was passed without objection. (4) Proposal to establish a new agricultural trial and rental office (proposed by Lin Anbang) Yao Huiquan explained that the China Vocational Education Society's new agricultural tool promotion office originally had trial and rental methods. The trial has now been implemented, and the rental has been temporarily suspended due to practical difficulties. Is there a solution? Please submit it to the conference for discussion. The chairman paid for the vote and it was passed.</p>
<h3 id="e90">(III) Industrial and Commercial Education Group Meeting <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Attendees: Yang Weiyu, Meng Xiyan, Wang Zhongxiang, Zhu Fangshi, Zhang Zulie, Liao Zuyin, Zhao Ziyi, Yang Peiwen, Zhao Shifu, Wan Sinian. Chairman: Zhao Shifu. The following proposals were discussed: (1) In order to restore rights and interests, resist imported goods, and develop my country's industry and commerce, we should vigorously promote arts and crafts education and establish specialized schools to cultivate talents. It was resolved in principle to pass the proposal and hand it over to the China Vocational Education Society to supplement opinions and submit it to the Ministry of Education for consideration. (2) Pay attention to commercial education. It was resolved that this proposal could be sent to commercial high schools and university business schools for reference. At the same time, it was submitted to the Ministry of Finance and Industry and Commerce to issue a notice to all financial and industrial and commercial agencies across the country to uniformly adopt new-style bookkeeping. At the same time, we should also send a letter to the chambers of commerce in various provinces to advise them, and during the initial commercial study period in schools, we can also study old-style bookkeeping to assist in reference. (3) Implement labor education. It was resolved to ask the China Vocational Education Society to formulate detailed methods and contact the factory, and at the same time submit it to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to issue a notice to all factories to pay attention to labor education. (4) The teaching materials of workers' schools should be compiled separately according to the occupational nature of their students. It was resolved to ask the China Vocational Education Society to promote the main purpose of this proposal to various industrial combinations and agencies separately. (5) Please ask the government to stipulate the method of collecting factory school funding donations and issue a notice to all factories across the country to comply with it. It was resolved to retain this proposal. (6) Promote popular vocational supplementary education. It was resolved to ask the China Vocational Education Society to formulate detailed methods according to the removal of items 3 and 5 and submit them separately. (7) Implement supplementary education and establish libraries. It was resolved to send a letter to the Library Association for consideration and implementation. At the same time, Aizhi vocational schools should expand vocational libraries and submit a request to the Ministry of Education to order provinces and counties to establish vocational libraries. (8) Organize a work-study education committee to study and investigate work-study plans as a contribution to the implementation of a part of work-study in the domestic Central University. It was resolved to ask the China Vocational Education Society to handle it with reference to this proposal. (9) The society should raise funds to set up a bank to support the development of small-scale agricultural, industrial, and commercial industries, so as to increase the number of occupational positions and the amount of production and benefit the society. It was resolved to ask the China Vocational Education Society to consult with economic experts and industrialists who are enthusiastic about this cause to study methods and earnestly promote it. (10) Establish a large-scale correspondence university to facilitate the universality of higher education. It was resolved to temporarily retain it.</p>
<h3 id="e91">(IV) Welcoming Conference of 17 Organizations <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>

<h3 id="e92">(V) Today's Second Plenary Meeting <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The second plenary meeting was held in the assembly hall of the Society at 9:00 AM today. The agenda was as follows: (1) Open the meeting and perform the ceremony as usual; (2) Report on the resolutions of the first plenary meeting and group meetings; (3) Discussion: (A) Mr. Zhong Zhixiu's opinions on the conference; (B) Location of the next Vocational Education Organization Joint Conference and the chairman of the year; (C) Other (4) Closing.</p>
<h3 id="e93">(6) Zhong Zhixiu's Opinions on the Conference <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>(1) In the past annual meetings, many proposals were put forward and resolved, but few were implemented. It would be better to change to discussing problems, that is, to submit the most difficult or most rewarding points felt by the schools in the past two years for discussion, or to criticize them, so that other schools can adopt them. This can avoid bureaucratic meetings and only get a few dead resolutions. (Private organizations have no political power to speak of, it is better to provide the results of the discussion for people to adopt.) (2) Six months before each meeting or at the end of each meeting, jointly decide on the central issues for the next or current meeting, such as moral education liaison, educational methods, graduate prospects and supplementary studies. Designate several experts in advance to prepare the discussion topics, scope and procedures so that members can prepare in advance for purposeful participation, so that one case will not be raised by A, and another case will be raised by B, so that all proposals cannot be discussed with prepared and sufficient materials. (3) Each vocational school does not have a concise report and lacks a research attitude of contact, which can be used as a basis for improvement. The General Assembly should prepare a report format in advance and ask them to fill it out. It is not necessary for each school to report at the meeting, just choose the main points to report. Moreover, it can be based on this report to make a general report for the reference of the world.</p>
<h3 id="e94">(7) Exhibition Welcomes Visitors <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>

<p>Recently went to the capital. I heard that my old friend Liang Dingming built a painting studio in Yang of Linggu Temple. He will make a large oil painting as a wall decoration for the Memorial Hall of the Martyrs Cemetery. Liang is from Guangdong. He is good at oil painting, charcoal, etc. He works in the Whampoa Military Academy and the Central Party Department. His paintings are full of revolutionary spirit. Therefore, he is called a revolutionary painter by the people of the time. Some time ago, he went to Europe to study fine arts on the order of Chairman Chiang. After returning to China, it happened that the central government proposed to build a martyrs' cemetery, and there was a preparatory committee. The chairman was Chiang Chung-cheng. The members were He Yingqin, etc. The secretary was Chen Guofu. The architect was a Westerner, Murphy. The engineer was Liu Mengxi. And the art item. Then Liang Jun is in charge. A preparatory office has been set up in Linggu Temple. The budget is 500,000 yuan. It will take three years to complete.</p>
<p>On Sunday, I drove to visit Liang Jun. When I arrived at the temple, I saw that Zhang Jingyu, Zhang Zhihan, and He Yushu were having fun taking pictures with Liang Jun. Seeing me arrive. Happily said goodbye. After Zhang and others left. I then accompanied Liang Jun into the room for a talk. Asked about the painting situation. Liang Jun told me. This move is really one of the greatest creations of my life. I will devote my energy to it. I am currently searching for painting materials. To describe the revolutionary history. On the one hand, looking for craftsmen to select materials. Build a large painting studio that is 26 feet high and 42 feet long. On one side, 6,000 yuan of canvas and 15,000 yuan of oil paints have been ordered from abroad. When they arrive. I will use three years of dedicated effort to create this mural that is 20 feet high and 400 feet in circumference. After the painting is successful. According to Chairman Chiang's intention, a special hall will be built to display it. Ordinary buildings are not suitable. It is estimated that work will begin in five months. The red sun is in the mountains. I said goodbye. Go back and remember it. To tell those who visit Linggu for paintings.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Supplementary Notes on Yu Tiansui Anecdotes, Zheng Yimei <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Yu Tiansui passed away. I have already recorded its outline before. Now, I will supplement the things that have not been mentioned. Mr. is talented in many ways. He lived in the village when he was young. There is a Taoist priest next door. Good at playing the flute and composing tunes. Mr. likes it. Follow him to learn. My father knew it. Because Mr.'s partners are not his kind. He was greatly reprimanded. However, Mr.'s understanding of sound and discrimination of rhythm. This is the beginning. His teacher, Mr. Hu Shiyu. Skilled at painting ink plums. Mr. also imitated it for splashing ink. The air of ease overflows between paper and ink. One day, I suddenly realized the principles of landscape painting. Then he wrote the hills and valleys in his heart. The realm of art is very different. It's just that I don't want to do more. The owner of the Xinhange Pavilion, a fan collector in China. He once obtained a landscape painting. Unfortunately, he lost it in a tavern while visiting the lake last year. It was after being drunk. I don't check myself. After waking up. I was quite frustrated. To ask Mr.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Peach and Lotus Yang Yixiao <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Every summer. I always remember the Shanghai yellow mud wall honey peach. And the Yuyuan Siamese lotus. Looking back on the vicissitudes of life. It's only been twenty or thirty years. It makes people feel the past and present.</p>
<p>The most famous is the yellow mud wall honey peach. When the peaches are ripe. You can go inside to buy and eat your fill. However, people are not allowed to take a peach out. I'm afraid to keep the pits for private planting. Later, because the houses were renovated. The peach trees are no longer there.</p>
<p>Yuyuan used to have Siamese lotus flowers. It was very prosperous for a while. Later, the lotus flowers in the pond gradually deteriorated. Now there is only a lotus pond. And there are no lotus flowers to see. Re-do it to make up for the regret. Unexpectedly, Mr. was plagued by illness. The disease never recovered. He can no longer engage in painting. Then how can Xin Hange's owner expect it? Mr. is good at calligraphy. It resembles Nuan Sou. In the past, he taught at the Wuzhong Caoqiao School. Students always asked for calligraphy couplets. Mr. complained about it. It is not difficult to write, but it is difficult to grind ink. The students then stored ink in urns. Asking for it never stops. Mr. was even more distressed. Then he posted a price list to refuse. And the annoyance began to resolve. The Northern Expedition was successful. Mr. took a job at the Wuzhong Water Police Political Training Department. During the leisure time of documents, he still sold calligraphy for wine money. His declaration is very elegant. Such as cloud. Tiansui is in distress and determined. For more than ten years. Only supported by pen and ink. Now I am lucky that Chong'er has restored the country. Lu and Jie Tui. Official hidden in Wumen. Willing to be a soldier. Even though the name is cheap. It has been revealed in newspapers. Old friends and new acquaintances. I am annoyed by pen and ink. I don't know to serve the public. Equal to hiring. Since politics is a job. It is not as leisurely as a yamen. After the documents are processed. The shape and spirit have been exhausted. I also think about my old business. Nourish my nature. However, due to the limitation of energy. It is difficult to apply to everyone. Therefore, I seek enlightenment. Think of getting a little bit of moisture. The crane salary is thin, so I can support honesty. Jia Hui will be issued first. I must be quick to obey the order. Send feelings to calligraphy. Fortunately, there is no suspicion of selling goods. Conclude a contract with lichen. If there is a habit of being obsessed. It resembles the essays of the Six Dynasties. It makes people chew endlessly. In addition to poetry and ancient prose, Mr. is also good at epigraphy, medicine, and Buddhist studies. I once said to Bu Xun. If you have leisure time. If each art can be pondered for several more years. All can be famous families. But trapped by life. Busy all day long. Spirit is not good. It's hateful. My son is studying at Chengzhong Middle School. In his spare time, he likes to write novels. It is very simple, Yongyou is interesting. It is truly a promising material.</p>

<p>The red emperor is rampant. The heat is like roasting. Living in Shanghai. Heard and witnessed. Apart from the hustle and bustle. There are very few ways to escape the heat. In early July. I was assigned to a short-term internship on the Beijing-Shanghai Road. Details in the station. The station chief, Mr. Xu Yonggui, gave instructions one by one. I have a lot of experience. In the afternoon, I proposed to visit Lingering Garden. I have heard the name of Lingering Garden for a long time. I have been running around in the secular world. Since last year. I wanted to go there but failed. Now I have fulfilled my long-cherished wish. The joy can be known. Enter the door. I and my colleagues used the name of the internship group. Ask for free admission. The gatekeeper did not allow it. After persisting for a long time. Change to half price. A little further in. I saw lush green shade. Winding paths. Enter a large hall. There is a pool in front of the hall. Shaded by lush trees. The pool water is dark green as if dyed. There are many goldfish in it. I bought some cakes and fed them. The fish scrambled for food. Stirring the water into a huge vortex. A friend brought a fast lens. Take a photo as a souvenir. The hall faces a rockery. The mountain is stacked with interesting features. Or rise like a cliff. Or stand precariously like a jagged rock. Mixed among the rocks. Most of them are ancient trees. Branching branches and trunks. Standing like ghosts and demons. The mountain wind blows. I don't know where I am. Rest for a while. Climb up the steps. A pavilion every five steps. A pavilion every ten steps. The exquisite architecture. The secluded arrangement. Sigh. Turn right. Enter the East Garden. It contains a complete set of books and illustrations. There are glass trees in it. But it has been sealed. I haven't had a chance to read it yet. In the hall. There is a huge plaque of the imperial calligraphy Lin Quan Qi Shuo. Golden and brilliant. Dazzling. It is said that it was handwritten by Emperor Qianlong. The gate is Dongshan silk and bamboo. The key is down. I heard there was a dance pavilion inside. Today, the gate is deserted. Desolate and unbearable. There are many stalagmites in front of the Guanyun Building. The place is also quiet. Going further from "Another Village". Go around a big circle in the garden. Climb to Zhile Pavilion. The pavilion is on the top of the mountain. Host</p>

<p>From the United States to Honolulu by the Ocean Maru. The captain was very hospitable. Special Chinese and Japanese meals are prepared. The taste is very palatable. On the occasion of parting, he also gave souvenirs. The ship arrived in Honolulu at 8:00 on the 18th. More than a dozen local overseas Chinese and several Westerners came to greet them by boat. Those who saw them all scrambled to hold garlands to greet them. To tie it around the collar. This is called PLOBA. This is the local custom. The more the better to show welcome and love. Wanhua's wreath. As high as the ears. Almost unable to look left and right. When the ship arrived at the shore, the chief of the police station, the president of the chamber of commerce, the president of the Pacific Federation, and the representative of the mayor were present. Representatives from overseas Chinese associations and various organizations also came. About fifty people. All boarded the ship. The mayor stood on the dock in person. At that time, the governor telegraphed the customs and immigration bureau. All sent people to the ship to contact. The customs supervisor also came to the ship in person. All are very amiable. The supervisor briefly inquired about the luggage brought in. Then he signed each one to exempt from inspection and release. The Immigration Bureau Commissioner said. I came to the ship to take care of it. To avoid difficulties at the station. But I only need to see Mr. Mei's face. Then shake hands. He also said that according to the usual practice, everyone should have a permit to land. This time there are many people. I'm afraid it will take time. Please board first. The permits will be sent to the hotel. To complete the formalities. Then everyone boarded the ship one after another. There was a military band to greet them. Arrived at the shore to meet the mayor. After a few words of greeting. The mayor said. This place has been waiting for Mr. Mei for a long time. There are almost daily inquiries. Today we meet. I am really comforted. Wanxun Xie. He immediately took a photo with the mayor. There are also many other people who asked to take photos. After taking the photos. Take a car with the mayor. There is also a detective sent by the governor following. Five police cars in front of the car. Horn to go ahead. First go to see the Governor. The mayor has something to do first. The governor also praised Wan very much. I have long heard of the famous name. I am fortunate to know you today. I have read various newspapers in the United States before. Knowing that you are very popular everywhere. This time to here. The locals are unusually happy. Because Honolulu is in the middle of the Pacific. The concept of national boundaries. Slightly worse than the mainland. And the government also strongly promotes the emotional connection between residents and people from various countries. Therefore, people from China, the United States, Japan and other countries are very harmonious in the society. Mr. Mei is a world-renowned person. In China, it goes without saying. In Japan, he was already famous several years ago. This time in the United States. And received great welcome. And most of the residents here are from these three countries. Then Mr. Mei's arrival here. It should be the most welcomed person here in several years. After talking for a long time. He also led him to watch the film about the history of the Central Government in his room. He also took a photo together. He excused himself and came out.</p>
<p>. The second visit to the mayor. The mayor is dealing with official documents. He rushed to greet him and led him to sit down. He said that he had met him just now. He was wronged by a visit again. Why are you so polite. Later, I talked about the international concept and racial concept of the residents here. There is not much discrimination. Because there are the most Japanese people here. About 130,000 people. accounting for four-tenths of the island. Chinese people are second. About 30,000 people. There are also more than 30,000 Americans. 6,000 Koreans. 25,000 natives. 70,000 Filipinos. 28,000 Portuguese. 25,000 Europeans. 20,000 mixed races. And all schools attend classes together. They get along well with each other. Therefore, there are quite a few marriages between two races. Over time. Then the racial concept will naturally fade. For example, my parents are of two races. There are a lot of local Chinese people who have received higher education. Therefore, they are especially harmonious with Americans. Mr. Mei came to this land with great fame and great skills. I know that on culture and emotion, it will definitely increase a lot of harmony. Wanzun was too busy with official affairs. So he took a photo together and said goodbye. I went to pay a visit to Consul General Huang Jun Yunsheng Su. President of the American Chamber of Commerce. President of the United Pacific Council. China General Chamber of Commerce. Most of the gentry and directors of the association have received higher education. The friendship is especially touching.</p>
<p>There is a postscript. "In the past, Wang Youjun was very fond of planting fruit in his life. There is great pleasure in this. I planted a lot of fruit trees on the west side of the garden and built a small pavilion on it. It is called ZHILE. It is like this. "Each pavilion has a title. I was in a hurry when I visited. I didn't have time to remember everything. One of them is called "Wenmuxiang Pavilion." The pavilion is full of osmanthus trees. However, the strangeness of the naming turned into a smile. The garden covers an extremely wide area. Similar to Bansong in Shanghai. Although there are similarities, its tranquility is far beyond the reach of any famous garden. The owner of Lingering Garden. I heard that it is the Sheng family of Biling. The splendor of the past. It can be imagined in this garden. Today, the broken tiles and ruined walls are desolate. Prosperity and decline are far apart. It is indeed a great emotion for us. I still remember a couplet by Zhang Zhiwan. "Beyond the three paths, the structure is increased." Drawing water through boats. Building pavilions because of the peaks. Singing and gathering friends joyfully." "I remember coming here thirty years ago. Climbing the building to watch the rain. Leaning on the railing to face the wind. Looking down, it has become a feeling of past and present." Alas. Thirty years later, Lingering Garden. Climbing the building and leaning on the railing. I can't help but feel the past and present.</p>

<p>Chapter Thirteen: Who Unintentionally Sowed Blessings and Obtained a Closed Circle, Only This Predestined Relationship Has the Heart to Sing "Golden Threads"</p>
<p>Let's talk about Zuo Shichen and Long Ziyun...sitting on the grass of Wei Chun Garden, sipping tea. They gradually felt the night deepening... many gentlemen and ladies enjoying the cool breeze came. Because they heard that there would be fireworks at eleven o'clock tonight... everyone wanted to join the excitement. In fact, the so-called Eastern fireworks... are very simple... similar to our Chinese shooting star firecrackers... but they can emit red and green colors. The original Dongguan fireworks in China... can conjure up various stories... such as Emperor Xuanzong of Tang visiting the Moon Palace, the Cowherd and Weaver Girl meeting on the Magpie Bridge, etc. Today there are both Chinese and foreign fireworks... which is even more of a sensation for a while... Amidst laughter... a gust of evening wind passed by... carrying the scent of jasmine flowers on the temples... and the fragrance of white orchids on the chest... particularly elegant and charming. Zuo Shichen even wanted to meet Ruiyun, whom he hadn't seen for a long time, here... Although many colorful electric lights were installed on the grass in the bushes... in order to attract coolness, there was not much bright light. Just as Zuo Shichen turned his head, he saw Ruiyun avoiding his gaze... and talking and laughing with a female companion. Zuo Shichen thought that Ruiyun had not seen him... so he said softly to Long Ziyun... Mr. Long... it really is Ruiyun. But she didn't see me... look, isn't she talking to someone? Long Ziyun smiled... She saw you a long time ago... before you turned your head. She had already been looking at you... but she only saw your back silhouette... she was still wondering if it was you or not... Although she also recognized me a little... When you turned your head, she naturally confirmed that it was you... Probably a courtesan who has married into a respectable family... all the things from the past... seem to have died. As the ancients said... "All past things... are like yesterday's death... all future things... are like today's birth"... This can be regarded as a footnote to a prostitute's marriage into a respectable family... After marrying someone... it's like changing a lifetime. All the things from the past in the brothel... can only be regarded as things from a previous life. The guests who were known in the brothel in the past... can only be regarded as people from a previous life... People from a previous life... and people from this life... are completely unrelated. Have you ever seen people from this life... still recognizing people from a previous life? Zuo Shichen also agreed with Long Ziyun... but he said... This can really be regarded as "a world away"... But this "a world away"... is a man-made separation... not a natural separation... Although she is already a person of this world... I still recognize her after all... and she still recognizes me... it's just that we don't greet each other... Long Ziyun said... Naturally, we can't greet each other... She has many female companions here now... If she greets a strange man... gossip will immediately arise... I saw that when you turned your head, she avoided your gaze... When you didn't look at her, she was secretly looking at you... You didn't see it... but I saw it very clearly...</p>

<h3 id="e106">Fluctuations in Gold Bar Quotations Show Uncertainty <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Market conditions are intricate and confusing, seemingly pointing to an upward trend. Yesterday, the 21st, gold bar quotations showed uncertainty, with frequent rises and falls. The morning session saw fluctuations of about six taels of silver, and the afternoon session saw a change of four taels, but with an underlying upward trend. Exchange rates rose suddenly by half a point, but internally remained flat. Banks sold off slightly, but trading within the market remained broad. Firms such as Fuchang, Hengxing, and Wanxing all made purchases, while Yuansheng, Yuchang, and Shengyong showed strong selling intentions, but all firms lacked a clear direction, resulting in confusion and uncertainty. From the morning, with little movement on major transactions, the market opened high, with many buyers still present. A peak was subsequently observed, but the availability of drafts seemed limited, and with Yuansheng and others selling off, the price once fell by five or six taels, plunging to 92.5 taels. However, with eager buying, the price quickly rose by five taels. Later in the session, Fuchang, Hengxing, Yuancheng, and Yong and others continued to buy, while Yuansheng, Yuxing, Yong, Wanxing, and others all sold off positions, giving the market an appearance of strength, although with occasional fluctuations of two or three taels. With the draft market stabilizing, the price closed above 597 taels. As yesterday was a Monday, there was no major cable report, but Sunday's telegraphic dispatches showed no expansion or contraction. American banks increased by one-eighth.</p>
<p>The morning market was bumpy, with the September opening at 598 taels, up 1.8 taels. Gross prices fluctuated by two or three taels, lingering around 97 taels. Exchange rates remained flat. Mitsui sold near-term Japanese gold at 1 tael, 3 mace, 3 fen, 8 li, 7 hao, 5 si, and Dalian gold at 1 tael, 3 mace, 4 fen, 2 li, 5 hao. Subsequently, the price moved from 96.23 taels to 98.89 taels, with Xianling announcing a rise of 1.25, US dollars up 2.5 jiao, and Japanese gold down 1 fen, trading at 97.26 to 7.6 taels, fluctuating by six or seven jiao within a few minutes. With internal slackening, near-term Japanese gold was available for sale at 1 tael, 3 mace, 3 fen, 3 li, 7 hao, 5 si, with Zhifeng, Yonghengxing, and hedge traders selling off, causing the price to plummet by five taels to 92.5 taels by 9:50 am. Shortly after, with movements of two, four, or five qian, each party began pursuing purchases after 10:15 am, causing prices to rise sharply by over five taels. However, Xianling and other firms remained stable, with no changes, and fellow traders showed little inflow or outflow. By 11:30 am, the market surged to 98.2 taels, then fell back by one tael in an instant, with fluctuations around seven taels. The market closed at 97.7 taels at noon.</p>
<p>The evening market recovered, rising by 1.2 taels. The afternoon market opened at 97.7 taels, then rose by over one tael to 99.1 taels, with Senchang, Yong, and others buying. Afterward, the market showed a latent state of weakness. HSBC sold August British gold at 6 pence, 1 li, 8 hao, 7 si, 5 hu, and Taiwan sold Japanese gold at 1 tael, 3 mace, 3 fen, 7 li, 5 hao. Yuansheng and others sold off, causing the price to fall to 96.6 taels by 2:45 pm. Subsequently, with Fuchang and Hengxing buying, the price rose again by two taels, reaching 98.6 taels by 3:45 pm. Suddenly, news arrived that the Indian exchange rate had risen again in the Three Kingdoms over the weekend. Sellers immediately became active, causing the price to drop by 3.5 taels to 95 taels. At 4:00 pm, Hengxing made a large bid, causing the price to jump by over three taels to 98.7 taels. By the 4:30 pm close, the market was at 97.4 taels, a rise of 1.2 taels compared to the previous weekend (the 19th), reversing the decline of the previous two or three days.</p>
<p>The listed price is still suppressed by over 50 taels. The highest price of the day was 99.1 taels, and the lowest price was 92.5 taels, a range of 6.6 taels. The listed price has been revised to 652.2 taels, with Japanese gold listed at a decrease of 1 fen. The morning market saw suppression of 54 or 55 taels, then around 60 taels. At noon, the suppression was down to about 54 taels. In the early afternoon, the suppression was down to 53 or 54 taels, then estimated at 57 taels. The final suppression was still about 55 taels.

<h3 id="e107">Foreign Exchange Market Apparently Relaxed, But Inwardly Tight <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC suddenly increased foreign exchange rates by half a point, with British gold up 1.25 to 1 shilling and 6 pence, US dollars up 2.5 to 36.5 yuan, Indian currency up 0.5 yuan to 100.75 rupees, French francs up 7 yuan to 927 yuan, German currency up 2.5 yuan to 154 marks, Japanese yen up 0.5 yuan to 90.5 shield, Hong Kong currency up 0.25 to 85.25 taels, Singapore currency down 1 tael to 154.5 taels, and Japanese gold down 1 fen to 1 tael, 3 mace, 5 fen, 2 li, 5 hao. Since the reduction of half a point the previous week, there had been no movement for ten days, until yesterday when the rate was finally increased. The market conditions seemed relaxed, but the internal operations of banks remained mediocre. Japanese gold rose slightly, creating an image of apparent relaxation but internal firmness. Gold bar quotations fluctuated wildly, with the front and back markets fluctuating by six or seven taels, leaving people confused and helpless. In the end, the market still rose by 1 tael. Chinese speculators and the Dalian group bought slightly, with about 100,000 pounds of British gold changing hands, with tens of thousands of pounds being bought in. The East Asia and HSBC sold off. Gold firms also sold off slightly, while Mitsui bought in. About 200,000 US dollars were traded, with Mitsui and Banque Sino-Belge buying in, but Banque Sino-Belge also sold. Several tens of thousands of Japanese currency were bought, with banks such as Mitsui, Mitsui Bussan, Taiwan Bank, and Sumitomo selling off. Mitsui also bought in. The current quantities are limited. By the afternoon close, British and American currency showed no gains or losses compared to the previous weekend, while Japanese gold rose by 0.75. The market atmosphere was normal.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Silver Dollar Market Gradually Becoming Quiet <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: Recently, due to the slackness of sales in various ports and the lack of demand for silver, the market atmosphere has been declining, with no hope of revival. Yesterday's situation showed a gradual downward trend. Although prices were slightly better than the previous noon, the quiescence and sluggishness of market sentiment indicated that it would be difficult to rise.</p>
<p>Premium/Discount Prices (Silver Premium): The morning and noon markets were the same at 7 qian, 2 fen, 9 li, slightly better by half a li than the previous day's noon market. The external market remained unchanged, and conditions were sluggish. (Silver Discount: The morning market was 1 qian, and the noon market was 7 fen. Banks quoted 4 fen. Head allocations were arbitrarily applied, with no additional value added throughout.)</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: Jiangnan small silver coins were up in the morning and tired in the afternoon. The morning market was at 6 qian, 3 fen, 6 li, and the noon market was at 6 qian, 3 fen, 4 li, with transactions made. The morning market saw 4,000 jiao, and the noon market saw 2,000 jiao. Guangdong small silver coins were the same in the morning and noon markets at 6 qian, 1 fen, 5 li, 5 hao, with transactions made. The morning market saw 165,000 jiao, and the noon market saw 90,000 jiao. Copper coins remained at 380,000 wen.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow (Silver Amounts): Although yesterday was Monday, the amount of silver received and disbursed was not very high. Chinese firms received over 2.2 million in bills, foreign firms received over 2.5 million, advances were 1 million, special disbursements were over 1.2 million, and various goods, exchange taxes, and other disbursements totaled about 10 million. Outflow was 1.4 million. Japanese banks received over 4.3 million in various disbursements, with an outflow of 300,000. Qianzhuang and silver firms received over 37.7 million in single disbursements, head allocations were over 3.8 or 3.9 million, and exchange disbursements from various routes were over 800,000, with over 1 million in cash received. (Silver dollars, exchange bill disbursements, and morning market transactions totaled 1.61 million. Noon market transactions were 1.04 million. Banknotes were only 30,000 in the noon market. Outside the market, banknotes were 148,000 in the morning market and 160,000 in the noon market. Bank transactions: interbank transactions were 400,000 in the morning market and 550,000 in the noon market. Interbank silver account transactions were over 1.5 million, with banknote inflows and outflows of over 1 million. Qianzhuang and silver firms' single disbursements were over 4.3 million, and head allocations were over 2.1 million. Interbank silver loans were over 1.7 million, with transactions among small qianzhuang being over 500,000. Outflow was quiet, with inflow being over 300,000.)</p>
<h3 id="e109">British Silver Dollars No Longer Trade at a Premium <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>In recent months, the availability of ready silver dollars in Hong Kong has been insufficient for circulation. Furthermore, the Hong Kong exchange rate is higher than the Shanghai exchange rate. Consequently, British silver dollars have been used as a substitute for Hong Kong silver dollars. Thus, the market price of British silver dollars in Hong Kong has been the same as that of Hong Kong silver dollars. However, the market price of Hong Kong silver dollars has consistently been over 8 qian and 2 fen, while the purchase of British silver dollars in Shanghai, even with a premium of several fen, has still been worthwhile. As a result, small qianzhuang involved in spot trading have been rushing to purchase them. Consequently, the import of British silver dollars into Hong Kong has been accumulating daily, eventually reaching saturation. However, the inflow has continued uninterrupted. The Hong Kong authorities, fearing changes in the market, have prohibited the import of British silver dollars. Passengers landing are prohibited from carrying more than 50 yuan, and large shipments are completely prohibited. Therefore, the sales channels for British silver dollars have been cut off, and the supply to Shanghai has been unable to continue. As a result, British silver dollars recently have no longer traded at a premium and are treated the same as ordinary silver dollars. The previous premium of 5 or 6 fen per silver dollar is now a distant memory.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the bond market conditions in Shanghai saw a reduction in futures trading. Major firms were all watching and waiting, as the overall bond market showed no changes and market sentiment was subdued. Spot trading also fell as before. The trend of bond prices also reflected the low volume of market transactions. Bond prices became increasingly stagnant, with Customs Duty, Reorganization, and Demobilization bonds only fluctuating by about 0.5 yuan. Other bonds showed almost no change. The total daily spot trading volume was only 14,000 yuan, and futures trading totaled 4.975 million yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Yarn and Cotton Market Conditions Remain Good <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and remained flat in the afternoon. However, the overall situation remained good, although most people expected lower prices due to sluggish sales. However, buyers remained calm, with no intention of easing up. Overseas cotton yarn market conditions remained firm, so the market situation remained flat. It is said that the labor conditions at the Jardine Matheson factory have been agreed upon, with a three-day work stoppage per week. The overall trend in the yarn market is still expected to be volatile.</p>
<p>Man-made Fiber Rises in the Morning, Flattens in the Afternoon: In the pre-market session, with the continued rise in overseas cotton, market sentiment was firm. Buying interest in the market was relatively tight, with prices rising by 2, 5, 6, and 7 qian. In the afternoon, some profit-takers closed out positions, with prices falling by 1, 2, 3, and 4 qian. The total daily trading volume was 6,600 bales. It was found that Heshen, Maoji, Taichang, Yiyu, Tianchang, Deji, Changji, and Dafeng bought between 200 and 600 bales. Rongxing, Hengde, Lichang, Rongfeng, and Yichang sold between 200 and 750 bales. The closing prices for man-made fiber are listed below:</p>
<p>Man-made Fiber | Closing Price | Change | Volume Traded</p>
<p>---|---|---|---</p>

<p>Spot Sales Total 1,200 Bales: Spot yarn sales are still good. A total of 1,210 bales were bought by various groups throughout the day. Fellow traders bought 100 bales. Market conditions were flat. Among the out-of-town traders, the Wuhu group bought the most at 400 bales. In addition, Shantou bought 125 bales, the interior bought 75 bales, the Guangdong group bought 150 bales, Xiamen bought 35 bales, Xuzhou bought 225 bales, Tianjin bought 80 bales, Jiangxi bought 40 bales, Gaoyang bought 30 bales, and other groups bought 50 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Cotton Market Rises Initially, Then Falls <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market rose initially, then fell. However, both Indian and American cotton are trending upward, so market sentiment is slightly firm. Later, with the fall in exchange rates, the market atmosphere weakened, and with pressure from short sellers, the market became even weaker. However, Eastern cotton still showed some short covering. If American cotton can stabilize, domestic cotton may not fall significantly in the short term.</p>
<p>Tianlong Buys 4,000 Loads of Han Standard: In the pre-market session, Han Standard cotton prices rose due to the rise in American and Indian cotton, with scattered households covering short positions, rising by 2 qian. Prices fell slightly by 0.05 yuan in the second and third sessions. The result was a rise of 1.5 to 2 qian. In the afternoon, some people sold off, with prices falling by 1.5 to 2 qian. The total daily trading volume was 24,700 loads. It was found that Maoji, Tongxing, Shenchang, Dafeng, Qinfeng, Hengde, Lichang, Yuantaiyuan, and Da sold between 900 and 1,500 loads. Tianlong, Taixing, Yuchang, Shenyugong, Taiyi, and Chang bought between 1,000 and 4,000 loads. The closing prices for Han Standard are listed below:</p>
<p>Han Standard | Price | Change | Volume Outstanding</p>

<p>Demand for Raw Cotton Remains Slack: Spot trading remains rare. The inflow included 105 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton: 35.75, Shenxin bought 284 pieces, spot delivery to the factory</p>
<p>Yao Cotton: 53.40, Guangdong group bought 400 bales, spot delivery at the warehouse</p>

<p>According to a friend from Tongzhou, the new cotton crop situation is as follows: The cotton fields have been reduced by about 20%. The growth of the new cotton seedlings is quite good. However, in some areas, the cotton farmers cannot work due to the rampant banditry, resulting in weed growth. The recent strong winds caused minor damage, with minimal losses. It is hoped that there will be sunny weather in the future to enable a good harvest.</p>

<p>Bombay: Market conditions last week were significantly influenced by the political situation. There was strong demand for Oomras cotton. The main buyers were exporters and Japanese firms. There were also large orders from Europe, resulting in a firm market price. Bombay mills were facing a difficult situation due to poor demand for yarn and cloth. The statistics for last week are appended below (unit: 1,000 bales):</p>

<p>Liverpool: Spot demand for American cotton was poor last week. Inquiries for other varieties were strong. Futures trading remained quiet due to uncertainties in US cotton weather reports and unstable Indian cotton market conditions. Egyptian cotton was particularly firm due to dryness in the central and western United States.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Grain Foodstuffs - Eastern New "Jing" Rice Selling Briskly <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Chen Bai Jing Rice Drops Frequently by More Than Half a Yuan</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, over ten boats of inland rice arrived. Inventory along the riverbank has gradually thickened. Wholesale sales on this street are slow, and buying sentiment is exceptionally subdued. Changzhou-Wuxi northern "Jing" rice again fell by about twenty coppers yesterday. In the past two days, it has already fallen by a substantial half yuan. Since the Bureau of Social Affairs approved free transactions between rice merchants and rice shops, all evaluation meetings only execute procedures for registering incoming goods. Covert price fixing and private posting of prices have completely disappeared because the rice merchants declared that violation would be fined one thousand yuan. Therefore, daily shop sales are largely stagnant, and transactions are scarce. Currently, factory goods, warehouse goods, boat goods, and other "Bai Jing" rice require special top-grade rice which opens at twenty-one yuan. Medium and inferior grades are uniformly discounted based on quality. Market conditions are gradually returning to their original state, but "Jing" rice prices are rapidly declining. Eastern new "Jing" rice has already been listed for sample viewing. In the past two days, over three hundred "shi" have been seen. The price opens at twenty-one yuan and sells very well. Although this new "Jing" rice is slightly broken, buyers greatly welcome it. If the weather can remain sunny for a long time, the number of shipments will definitely be strong, and the price may be difficult to sustain. Those with flexible capital raise prices to undercut competitors. The general market is mixed with firm and weak prices; top-grade goods still open at about nineteen and a half yuan.</p>
<p>Hu Nan: About ten boats have arrived from the river. Shop sales are flat. Since the Eastern new rice was transacted, people's hearts have been dispirited. Furthermore, foreign rice has also fallen by twenty or thirty coppers. Saigon small-grain rice transactions are becoming scarce, and the price is also softening. The "Jing" rice market is therefore difficult to sustain. Although the price has fallen, sales remain sluggish, and the trend is increasingly weak. General market prices are all at twenty yuan and five or six coppers. Although thin-husked rice goods are not strong, they are also declining along with "Jing" rice. Interest from all parties is lacking. "Le" short-grain rice is permissible, but "Yang Du Jian" rice is not being inquired about. The market price only opens at the nineteen yuan mark, and it requires a change of about half a yuan. Yuan goods are scarce, sales are weak, and market prices are stable, opening high at nineteen.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Foreign Rice Continues to Fall by Half a Yuan <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Inventory at Five Hundred Thousand Bags</p>
<p>Down Two Yuan Compared to the Beginning of Last Week</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice showed fatigue and sluggishness in the morning. Those customers who intended to speculate and hoard were wavering even more, and many did not hesitate to lower prices to sell. There was surplus seeking to be sold, so the situation became more depressed. The price then dropped slightly by about half a yuan. After this drop, local inland cheap-rice hoarders and scattered laborers inquired. The total market transaction volume exceeded ten thousand bags, and the market price was able to stabilize, but it was already down by fifty coppers compared to the previous market and about two yuan for each small-grain and number two Saigon rice compared to the highest market price of last week. Fortunately, the high-grade goods were supported by "Du" rice, and the decline was slower. The rice stored in Shanghai, excluding the inventory handled in this street, is estimated to be about five hundred thousand bags, with high-grade goods accounting for only one or two tenths. Yesterday's sales included one thousand five hundred bags of number one Saigon rice, priced at seventeen yuan and four coppers to seventeen yuan; three hundred bags of Annam rice, priced at seventeen yuan and six coppers; one thousand bags of Qieladi rice, priced at seventeen yuan and three coppers; four thousand bags of small-grain rice, priced at fifteen yuan and four coppers to fourteen yuan and five coppers; two thousand bags of large-grain rice, priced at thirteen yuan and one copper and three fen to twelve yuan and eight coppers; special high-grade rice, priced at thirteen yuan and seven coppers; one thousand bags of small-grain rough rice, priced at eleven yuan and eight coppers; and three hundred bags of Xuye rough rice, priced at thirteen yuan and five coppers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the reason for yesterday's sharp decline in foreign rice is superficially due to the suspension of customer orders and the price reduction by the owners. In reality, it is because the Jianghai Customs Office prohibited the reporting and transportation of foreign wheat to Yingkou and other ports. Customer gangs were unable to load and transport it, and they all sought to sell, causing a significant impact on the market. Medium and inferior goods have a large inventory and are particularly weak. Large-grain rice sold for only twelve yuan and two or three coppers near evening, a decrease of nearly one yuan compared to last weekend. Other small-grain rice decreased by half a yuan to seventy or eighty coppers. However, number one Saigon rice and other high-grade goods have less inventory and are better off.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Flour Sharply Falls by About Thirty Fen <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Rice Prices Loosen on All Sides, Northern Sales Blocked Entirely</p>
<p>Inland Ejects First, Manufacturers Dump Later</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, all months uniformly fell sharply. The original momentum of the previous rise originated from the soaring rice prices, reaching a historically high price. As a result, the general inland gangs purchased aggressively step by step, leading to intense popular sentiment, and the flour market also surged along with it. Until recently, due to the new rice having already entered the market, rice prices in various places also began to loosen. Coupled with the blockade of northern sales, the actual sales market suffered a major blow. Therefore, the most enthusiastic inland gangs, under the pressure of the environment, have abandoned their prejudices and are gradually selling off in large quantities. Manufacturers are also dumping step by step due to the lack of sales. Therefore, the strength of the selling pressure from the opening to the closing of the market was rare recently. Although the quotation for foreign wheat was four, five, or six coppers better, popular sentiment has already changed and did not prop it up at all. As a result, July and August fell by two fen compared to the previous week's closing price, September fell by three fen and two and a half li, October fell by three and a half fen, November fell by two fen and seven and a half li, and December fell by three fen.</p>

<p>Early Ripening and Bumper Harvest... Flour Sales Stagnant... Large Speculators Dump in Large Quantities</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the future wheat market in the morning, prices for all months fell sharply. Because the inland gang bulls have gradually sold off, and the local speculators, in view of the sluggish overseas sales and the stagnation of the wheat on the market, turned their attention and dumped in large quantities, especially the major speculators close to a certain factory, whose dumping was the most significant, causing popular sentiment to waver greatly, like a gale sweeping down, with the momentum of a river flowing straight down. Because of the general perception of early ripening and a bumper harvest, and wheat also stagnant due to the poor sales of flour, speculators' sentiments became very strong. It is estimated that the lowest price this month fell to four liang, five qian, and seven fen; August to four liang and six qian, a sharp drop of one qian and a half compared to the previous week; September to four liang and seven qian; October to four liang and seven qian and six fen; November to four liang and eight qian; and December to four liang and six qian and four fen, a drop of one qian or one qian and three or four fen. By the afternoon opening, there was a slight rebound due to short covering, but ultimately, the bearish momentum was still strong, and it showed signs of weakness again. As a result, July, August, September, and October increased by one qian and two fen compared to the previous week, November fell by one qian, and December fell by one qian and one fen. Because the factory still firmly refuses to move the wheat and the standard has already plummeted, the medium-high goods have also decreased by about one qian, while the medium-inferior goods have reached as much as two qian. For example, the inferior Gaoyou wheat opened at only four liang, three qian, and two fen, which shows the fierceness of the falling trend. It is estimated that a total of nine thousand six hundred bags of Gaoyou, Shuikou, Baoying, and Shashi wheat were opened, with Fuxin and Shenda purchasing half of them.</p>
<p>Piece Goods: Sales are sluggish in the sweltering heat.</p>
<p>Local Factory Cloth: The market is very chaotic, rising and falling suddenly, with extremely drastic changes. Coarse cloth once rose due to a labor strike at the Ewo factory. The matter has now been completely resolved, and prices have returned to their decline. Demand for fine cloth from northern gangs has quieted, and popular sentiment is slightly soft. Yesterday, "Blue Flying Fish" was down by one qian, and "Yang Crane Colored Ball" was down by two and a half fen. However, "Balloon" cloth is extremely smooth-selling due to the dyeing and finishing channels. Yesterday, another one hundred and fifty pieces were transacted, so the factory price rose by five fen instead, opening at six liang, seven qian, and five fen. The Shantou gang continues to seek fine twill, causing spot goods to fall, but prices remain firm. Except for slightly more retail sales, large-scale transactions of coarse twill are rare. Actual sales to the Ningbo and Wenzhou gangs in the Yangtze River basin have all quieted down, mainly due to the time reaching the dog days of summer.</p>
<p>Eastern and Western Piece Goods: There has been no great fortune or misfortune in recent days, but it is not as popular as before. Eastern goods, such as "straight tribute satin," remain firm. "First Merit" opens at two qian, eight fen, and seven qian and a half, "Heaven-Sent Gold" at three qian and two fen and a half, and "Four Scholars" at two qian and eight fen. The "Hunting Goose straight tribute woolen fabric," which was once out of stock, has now arrived, opening at two qian and five li. There have also been transactions with the Sichuan gang. Cotton velveteen is gradually softening. "Fuhua Bright Red" sold for one qian, eight fen, and seven and a half li yesterday, and "imperial concubine color" for one qian, seven fen, and seven and a half li. Bare white is the same price. Gray "Guangxie" is slightly down by five fen. "Purple Mountain" is at four liang and eight qian and five fen, and "Spring and Autumn Picture" is at four liang and seven qian and a half. Dark-colored "Ting" printed straight tribute woolen fabrics and other items have no significant sales channels. Due to the extremely small number of Western goods arriving, the same industry has already pre-ordered considerable goods, so it has gradually become calm in recent days, but prices remain firm.</p>

<h3 id="e122">After the Escalation of the French-Owned Water and Electricity Labor Strike <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Major Bloodshed on Rue Mâlang Yesterday</p>
<p>Twenty-Four Workers Arrested</p>
<p>More Than Twenty People Shot</p>
<p>Stray Bullet Kills One Innocent Person</p>
<p>Municipal Party Committee Cables Central Government to Protest</p>
<p>The French-owned water and electricity labor strike escalated further yesterday, leading to a major tragedy on Rue Mâlang. The details are compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Cause of the Tragedy: Since the outbreak of the labor strike at the company, it has dragged on for a month, with no hope of resolution. At present, it has almost moved from mediation to despair. Currently, although there are more than two hundred workers from the company's transportation department joining in the assistance, there are still a considerable number of people serving the company as usual. They have been repeatedly advised, recounting the company executives' step-by-step oppressive actions, such as armed detectives riding in cars following each tram that has been dispatched recently, and various demonstrations of strong-arm tactics. However, those who advised were earnest, but ultimately to no avail. This provoked public outrage, and more than two hundred workers from the machinery and transportation departments gathered at the Workers' Club on Rue Mâlang in the French Concession at around 8:00 AM yesterday to question them. Unexpectedly, when the large group of unarmed workers were heading there, the French police had already learned of it, mistakenly believing that they were about to riot, and immediately dispatched a large number of armored vehicles loaded with more than one hundred armed guards and police officers who opened fire and strafed the crowd. The crowd was greatly angered and was forced to retreat, but more than twenty people had already been shot and injured, unable to move, and were all arrested. A stray bullet also killed one innocent person, a mason, whose name is not known.</p>
<p>Conditions of Injuries: Fourteen arrested workers, most of whom were seriously injured and unable to move. It is reported that after the arrest, the police initially detained them in one room and took their statements, then sent the seriously injured to the hospital for treatment. Among the workers who escaped, one was seriously injured and four were slightly injured. One of the seriously injured and one of the slightly injured were sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment, while the others volunteered to go home for medical treatment.</p>
<p>Purchasing Medications: The French-owned water and electricity union, because the workers were suddenly strafed by the ruthless bullets of the imperialists, with as many as twenty people injured, although a portion had already been arrested, and there was no reliable news regarding treatment, immediately sent personnel to purchase a large batch of medications to try to send to the arrested people and the injured people outside to help them with their treatment. After learning of this, the Chinese tram workers' union also donated a considerable amount of medications.</p>
<p>Conditions of the Transportation Department: The conditions demanded by the transportation department are attached as follows: 1. Public buses, trackless trams, and trams will be assigned shifts in rotation, and all workers, regardless of seniority, will be equal. 2. Routes 6 and 3 must use two people to sell tickets, and large Route 2 buses of the third class must use one person to open doors. 3. Cancel the ringing of the bell to let passengers off, cancel unwarranted penalties and suspensions, and do not fire without cause. 4. Daily work must be eight hours, and overtime pay will be added accordingly. 5. If there is a danger when driving, the company should be responsible, and the driver will not be held responsible in any way. 6. The hiring of people or the suspension of business must be approved by the workers. 7. Three sets of uniform clothing must be issued each year, two sets of lined clothing and three sets of unlined clothing, and one overcoat. Regardless of seniority, all must be issued new clothing. 8. Roll call wages will be paid as usual. 9. Restore the jobs of unemployed workers. 10. It is necessary to recognize the workers' union and have the right to representation. 11. Cancel the club's public expenses and subsidize the union. 12. Each worker will receive an additional eight yuan in wages per month. 13. An annual bonus of two months' wages.</p>
<p>Chinese Employees Join: The company's senior Chinese employees had originally intended to join immediately, as reported in yesterday's newspapers. After yesterday's tragedy, they became even more indignant and resolutely joined together. They elected more than sixty representatives who reported to the French-owned water and electricity union at 4:00 PM yesterday, willing to join in the assistance. The union immediately convened a temporary meeting, chaired by Xu A'mei, to report to the representatives on the course of the forced strike and welcome their participation. Immediately, methods for all future actions were discussed.</p>
<p>Yesterday's General Meeting: After the tragedy, the union held a general meeting in the afternoon, with a total of more than seven hundred workers attending. The municipal party committee specially sent comrades Zhang Yaoming and Gao Xizhong to attend and provide guidance. The various union support associations also sent Lu Jingshi and Zhao Zhenhui as representatives to attend. Chen Puzhu served as chairman and Ai attended. After the ceremony, the chairman reported on the course of the tragedy and said that our workers' actions in going to the club today were extremely civilized. Unexpectedly, the running dogs had already fled without a trace. The French police actually believed that our workers were disrupting public order, without asking the circumstances, and opened fire and strafed, killing one of our Chinese people and shooting dozens of workers. From this point of view, the imperialists are actually treating us with the means of slaughtering dogs. If this is tolerable, what is not tolerable? We hope that all workers will work together. Then various motions were discussed: (1) Prepare a document stating the course of the tragedy and submit it to the higher-level agencies for unified negotiations. (2) Ask the support associations to expand publicity. (3) Petition to organize a support association for the tragedy. (4) Stipulate future work guidelines. It did not disperse until about 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Tram Service Suspended: There were only twelve trams running the day before. Yesterday, after the tragedy, all twelve trams were also uniformly suspended. Many Chinese and Vietnamese police officers are stationed in the company, waiting with guns, in a serious state. At 1:15 PM, the company suddenly intended to resume service, for a total of three trams, but it soon stopped. Then, a few more trams were dispatched.</p>
<p>Warning to the French Consul: Although this strike is due to the oppression of capitalists, the authorities of the French Concession cannot shirk their responsibility either. The French consul has not intervened in this matter and intends to send a letter of warning today, stating the act of being forced to strike, hoping to uphold justice and properly mediate in order to strengthen Sino-French relations.</p>
<p>Martial Law Yesterday: The French Concession has been under extremely strict guard for days. After yesterday's tragedy, it felt even more tense. The atmosphere was serious on each road and at each stronghold. At 6:00 PM, the iron gates at the borders of the Chinese Concession were closed.</p>
<p>Cable to Protest: Because of the tragedy of the French-owned water and electricity labor strike, the Huadong News reporter went to the municipal party committee at around 12:00 PM yesterday to consult Chen Junyi, a standing committee member of the civil training association. His statement was roughly as follows: I have not yet received a detailed report on the details of this case, but I heard that one person died and three people were injured. The municipal party committee will stop office hours this afternoon (ie, yesterday) and will not be able to convene a meeting to decide on countermeasures, but it has already sent a telegram to the central government to ask for instructions and ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to promptly protest to the French authorities. Moreover, the industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai have also heard that they are preparing countermeasures. The error in this tragedy lies entirely with the factory side. The factory workers' wages average only about twenty yuan per person. Now the price of rice is outside of twenty yuan. How can a family of eight make ends meet? Moreover, the factory's business is growing and developing. Recently, it has increased the salaries of French employees, even to the extent that each person can be increased by an average of over two hundred taels, but it absolutely does not increase the salaries of the workers who are living a hard life. Even after the workers resolved to go on strike, before the Bureau of Social Affairs mediated, the factory ridiculed the workers for not having the courage to strike, forcing a strike. Everyone knows this. Workers struggling for food and clothing is a common thing. In addition, I am also quite strange about the French Consul General. It seems that the French Consul General wants to resolve the expansion of the labor strike. We must know that if we want to resolve everything, we must cure the root cause. The way to cure the root cause now is to make the water and electricity company sincerely accept the mediation of the government. There is no other way. But now the police are arresting people and shooting them. At first, it was a stopgap measure, that is, abandoning the root and pursuing the branches. Therefore, the strike is getting bigger and bigger. Today, it has changed from a small labor-capital dispute to a labor strike. Today, it has changed from a factory's labor strike to a tragedy in the French Concession, that is, it has become an international negotiation. It is also within expectations that reactionary elements have decided to engage in and mix in to disrupt the event, that is, to create an incident similar to the May 30th Massacre. The French Consul General does not cure the root cause but specializes in the stopgap measure, then this responsibility is naturally borne by the French Consul General in the future, and it is also an extremely foolish thing.</p>
<p>Aid from All Circles: The Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' Aid to the French-Owned Water and Electricity Union Support Association (1) A letter to the workers of the French-owned water and electricity union says, Dear workers of the French-owned water and electricity union, you have been affected by the high cost of living and have made demands to the capitalists to seek help. This is a very legitimate and reasonable thing. Unexpectedly, the evil French imperialist capitalists are accustomed to implementing imperialist oppressive and destructive methods and have severely rejected your demands, resulting in an unavoidable strike. The company side, of course, cannot shirk its responsibility. Everyone recognizes that this strike of yours was caused by the capitalists. Your strike has long been realized, and you should continue to work hard with the revolutionary spirit of peaceful struggle to win the final victory. We will never tolerate imperialists using military policies to destroy humans who are all round-headed and square-footed. We are deeply indignant to hear that the French imperialist capitalists have colluded with the police to massacre our oppressed striking workers and harm civilians. At this time when the French imperialist capitalists are using all kinds of intimidating and tempting conspiracies, you should maintain a calm attitude and a courageous spirit and strive for a thorough victory. Rather die than give up. We must know that if the power of the imperialists is not eliminated for one day, the small and weak nations will have no way to survive for one day. This time, you have been able to uphold the spirit of great fearlessness and work hard to mediate with them. This is indeed an extremely glorious page in the history of the workers' movement. Workers, unite together, strictly prevent saboteurs, and maintain strike discipline. Do our work of struggle on the pure track of doctrine. Our association will use the power of the city's workers as your backing. We hope that you will redouble your efforts and fight the French capitalists desperately. Then, the final victory will belong to you. In the end, we shouted for the victory of the French-owned water and electricity union workers' strike. Down with French imperialism! (1) A letter to the citizens said, Fellow citizens of the city, the imperialists have occupied our country's territory and massacred our compatriots. This has become their usual trick. Anyone with blood and energy cannot help but be furious at this brutal action and inhumane means. But because the environment is difficult, we are unable to deal with it externally and have to seek perfection in injustice, recognize the pain and endure the shame, and not argue with them. How do we know that the imperialists are bloodthirsty by nature and have recently massacred our citizens in this city? We are so indignant to hear the news. We would like to tell our compatriots about the reasons for the massacre and the truth of the facts. This time, the French-owned water and electricity union of the French Concession, feeling that the price of gold has soared and that life is difficult, has made a statement and is requesting the capitalists to improve their treatment in order to maintain their lives. There is nothing wrong with such a legitimate request under French law, and it is also justifiable in reason. What working people rely on is nothing more than a small amount of wages, and there is no other source to help workers' lives. If the cost of living soars, then workers' wages should be increased accordingly. This is the usual practice of labor and capital in various industries. Unexpectedly, the French imperialist capitalists of the union do not give any consideration and are self-centered in their brutal destruction. The workers are pleading again, their tongues are tired and their lips are scorched, and there is no sincerity in accommodation. All the workers of the union are forced by their livelihood. In fact, there may be those who cannot bear to endure the pain of resignation, so they negotiate with all parties, but there is still no substantial effect. They could not bear it any longer and were forced to declare a strike in the hope of promoting the French imperialist capitalists' awareness. Since the outbreak of the labor strike, months have passed. The French imperialist capitalists have even used the trick of oppressing and massacring, colluding with the police, picking up Russian workers, using running dogs, and tempting and coercing. Their methods are vicious and their intentions are sinister, causing our compatriots to be agitated. Fortunately, the union workers are determined and determined to uphold the purpose of not giving up until they reach their goal. They are also very close in strictly preventing running dogs and expelling new workers. The club organized by the ticket inspectors is dedicated to destroying the union and colluding with the capitalists, so the union is especially vigilant. Yesterday, a group of running dogs convened a meeting in the club to disrupt the strike discipline. All the workers felt that the running dogs dared to illegally destroy it. Where should the strike discipline be placed? How can the lives of the whole body be sacrificed for the sake of their few running dogs? Therefore, the inspection team was supervised and entered the club to prohibit the meeting. At that time, the running dogs had already heard the news and scattered and avoided. The entire inspection team led the team out, just to reach the intersection. Unexpectedly, the capitalists had colluded with the police in advance and ordered a large number of armed police officers. When they saw the crowd, they fired their guns without asking the reason, and stray bullets were like rain. At that time, a certain citizen (the name is not listed because it has not been verified) who was passing by also succumbed to stray bullets and died. Two workers were seriously injured and twenty-three were arrested. Fellow citizens, we know that the establishment of police stations in the concessions was originally intended to protect residents and maintain public order. Even if the inspection team had improper actions at the time, it could have been arrested and prosecuted in accordance with the law. How could it be possible to fire a gun indiscriminately and launch a random strafing? What did the citizens do to deserve this toxic creation? If we do not submit a serious negotiation and punish the murderer in accordance with the law, in the future, every citizen of the concession can be killed by it. The association believes that this tragic murder case has actually created a second May 30th, which is of international importance. We hope that all fellow citizens will wake up early and make practical assistance to win glory for the country and avenge our compatriots. The time is urgent and cannot be delayed. This ant has achieved the final victory with the collective nature of the mantis struggle. Not only are the French businessmen and workers grateful and weeping, but also the future of the nation is fortunate. The association is willing to lead the power of 800,000 workers in the city to be its backing. If imperialism is not overthrown for one day, the spirit of struggle will not stop for one day. The book is urgent and inexhaustible. I would like to tell you that</p>
<p>The Fifth District and Seventh Branch of this city aided the French-owned water and electricity striking workers' document, Shanghai trade unions aided French-owned water and electricity union support association comrades publicly aware, the French-owned water and electricity capitalists, relying on the power of imperialist tyranny, have oppressed workers in every way, and thousands of people are living in an upside-down position every day. Recently, due to the rising price of gold and soaring prices, workers cannot bear the pain of life and demand increased wages. The reasons are not inconsistent, but the French capitalists not only do not accept the workers' requests, but also block the factory gate and refuse to allow workers to enter the factory, forcing a strike. In an instant, a month has passed. The capitalist attitude is firm, and the strike is expanding day by day. Communist elements are taking advantage of the opportunity to act, and social security is at risk. The trade unions in this city are heartbroken and cannot bear to sit idly by. They are all rising to support the cause and vow to be the backing. With the power of hundreds of thousands of workers, helping thousands of oppressed compatriots under the iron heel, why worry about not achieving victory? Although the French imperialists' means are fierce and their guns are sharp, I am afraid that they will also have to yield. The comrades of our branch are workers and are not the same as Qin and Yue. It is our duty to go through fire and water. In addition to fully supporting the French-owned water and electricity workers, we hope that your association will be angry and fight to the end so that the French-owned water and electricity workers can get out of the fire and water and ascend to the seat. I sincerely offer my condolences.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Social Affairs Bureau Admonishes Rice Industry <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Listing Points to Note and Ordering Compliance</p>
<p>Following the resumption of independent buying and selling by rice merchants at rice markets, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, fearing that rice merchants might once again engage in under-the-table price adjustments, harming the people's food supply, has specifically listed points to note, ordering all rice industry associations to comply and to make them known to the public. The points to note are recorded below: (1) Investigations have revealed that the past occurrences of price adjustments were due to the inability to strictly differentiate prices between high-quality and lower-quality rice, leading to the undermining of price limits. Since this order, the maximum price for top-quality white rice is limited to 21 yuan. High-quality and lower-quality rice must be strictly priced according to their grade. It is forbidden to sell lower-quality rice at the price of high-quality rice when high-quality rice is out of stock. Violators will be punished as if they were engaging in price adjustments. (2) Furthermore, investigations have revealed that when the price of Japonica rice rises, some mix higher and lower grades together for pricing, or bundle it with a certain percentage of Indica rice, which is effectively the same as price adjustment. In the future, if any of the above situations occur, they will be treated as price adjustment offenses. (3) Unscrupulous rice merchants often mix Indica rice into Japonica rice, hoping to gain illicit profits, which is extremely deceitful. Rice shops and vendors should be held responsible for sampling and inspecting at any time. Once discovered, they should immediately report to this Bureau for punishment. Those who collude to conceal the matter will be punished together. (4) After price evaluation, rice should be immediately unloaded. If merchants dare to refuse to sell, rice shops should be held responsible for immediately reporting to the Bureau, which will sell the rice on their behalf, and a fine of one yuan per picul will be imposed, which will be used as funding for affordable rice. (5) If, after price evaluation, the quality of the rice is found to have deteriorated, it should be re-evaluated immediately, and no disputes should be allowed. (6) The evaluation of rice will still be handled according to custom. If any underweight measurements are discovered, the rice shop will be responsible for compensation, and the measurer will be sent to the Bureau for punishment. If rice merchants use gratuities, leading to underweight measurements, the original vendor will be responsible for sending the rice merchant to the Bureau for punishment. (7) During the open price evaluation period, all rice shops purchasing rice from rice markets should obtain a rice purchase certificate from the Rice Organization Association and use the certificate to purchase from wholesalers. The wholesalers will separately record the number of piculs purchased and the price per picul, affixing a seal as proof. Purchasing rice without a certificate or inaccurate record-keeping will be punished as if engaging in price adjustments. (8) Rice boats selling rice should be allocated by each wholesaler for sale and should not be directly negotiated for purchase by a small number of shops. Violators will be punished according to the severity of the circumstances, in accordance with price adjustment penalties.</p>

<p>Purchasing Rice Without a Certificate or Inaccurate Record-Keeping Will Be Punished</p>
<p>The Rice Business Association Reorganization Committee hereby announces to all rice businesses:</p>

<p>To Whom It May Concern: On the 21st of this month, we received Instruction No. 2590 from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, which stated: "In order to ensure compliance, it has been observed that rice arriving from the river is now being independently bought and sold by wholesalers and shops. Given that rice prices have not yet fallen, there are concerns that rice shops may compete to purchase rice, offering price adjustments to rice merchants privately, which would be in violation of the law. To prevent such issues from arising, this Bureau hereby instructs the Association to immediately prepare rice purchase certificates and notify fellow businesses to obtain them. Starting from the 22nd of this month, all rice purchased from the North and South Market rice markets must be registered by the rice market with the certificate, indicating the number of piculs and price, and stamped as proof. Purchasing rice without a certificate or inaccurate record-keeping will be punished according to the price adjustment regulations for rice markets. You are hereby instructed to ensure that all fellow businesses comply. This is imperative!" In compliance with this instruction, we have prepared rice purchase certificates for all businesses to obtain. Hereafter, all rice businesses purchasing rice from wholesalers must first go to the Association's North Market office (old site of Tongxing Firm, west of Xinzha Bridge in the North Market) to affix a seal, sign a pledge, and obtain the certificate. Those businesses obtaining certificates must bring their shop's official seal to affix to the certificate at the Association's North Market office. This matter is officially mandated, so please ensure compliance. Furthermore, businesses within the International Settlement should bring one silver dollar to obtain the license for the second half of the year. This announcement is hereby issued.</p>

<p>Escorted to Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau arrested reactionary element Pan Qingzeng in December of last year. According to his confession, Chou Luanxie, commander-in-chief of the Eastern Route Army, had established an organization in Shanghai, appointed false positions, and attempted to incite rebellion. The Bureau dispatched officers to conduct a thorough investigation. On June 18th of this year, Chou Luanxie and an accomplice were arrested near Nanyang Bridge in the Chinese district and taken to the Bureau. It is reported that Chou, after being apprehended, frankly described the recruitment of followers and his reactionary plans without any concealment. The Bureau, considering his advanced age, treated him with courtesy.

<p>The case of the sale of the Shanghai International Settlement's Sino-Foreign Telephone Company to an international company has been finalized.

Committee members Qian Longzhang, Yu Hualong, Jiang Xinzhao, Yu Zhongxian, Zhang Xianfang, Qiu Jialiang, and eight others attended.

The Association, representing all residents, is determined to protect national sovereignty and safeguard the public interest of merchants and residents and is determined to oppose the sale to the end, without hesitation. On the one hand, they will contact various public organizations to unite and carry out opposition; on the other hand, they will raise funds to develop proactive countermeasures. The following measures were decided upon: (1) Committee Member Jiang Xinzhao proposed sending a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association to convene a representative assembly of taxpayers throughout the district as soon as possible to urgently discuss the opposition to the telephone sale. The proposal was approved and a letter of recommendation will be sent immediately. (2) Committee Member Qiu Jialiang proposed that there has been a recent initiative to form a Chinese Telephone Users' Association, but its contents, membership, and direction are unknown to the outside world. There are tens of thousands of Chinese telephone users in the Settlement. As a representative organization of the residents, this Association should immediately send representatives to investigate and make contact in order to unite efforts and strengthen the force. The proposal was approved and Committee Members Yu Hualong and Yu Zhongxian were appointed as representatives to make contact immediately. A second committee meeting is scheduled for this afternoon.

<p>Establishing a General Office in Shanghai</p>
<p>Raising Huge Sums for an Industrial Bank</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese merchants from various ports, in order to revitalize domestic industry and seek the development of domestic production, have initiated and organized the Overseas Chinese Industrial Return and Investigation Delegation to return to the country and go to the North and South to earnestly investigate various products as a preparation for starting operations. Yesterday, a portion of the delegation arrived in Shanghai and is currently staying at a foreign hotel on Baidu Bridge. The entire delegation consists of 25 people, with five people per team. According to a friend who introduced the reporter from the Guowen News Agency to Mr. Li Hairu of the delegation, the delegation will establish a general office in Shanghai on Hualong Road in the French Concession. All members of the delegation are wealthy overseas Chinese merchants who value practical work and are unwilling to engage in unnecessary extravagance and social events. The time limit for this return and investigation is six months. The plan is to establish a large-scale industrial bank in the country, with capital of more than 20 million. Because gold is expensive and silver is cheap at this time, it is extremely cost-effective for overseas Chinese to invest in their motherland, which is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Once the investigation is clear, a plan will be drawn up to obtain special rights from the government before conducting various industries, and to create opportunities to arouse the national public to work together to produce and recover rights, in order to achieve the purpose of saving the country through production.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Shipping News <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Customs discovered the incident of Shanghai merchants colluding with crew members to smuggle large sums of cash to Japan on the Japanese-owned Rian Line ships, the Shanghai Jianghai Customs has received an order from the Ministry of Finance to conduct a strict investigation. All ships leaving Shanghai for Japan, whether postal ships or cargo ships, will be subject to inspection. Also, because smugglers secretly go to Dalian Bay to transfer ships to Japan to avoid scrutiny, the Customs will also secretly investigate export ships leaving Shanghai for Dalian to prevent smuggling.</p>
<p>The delegation of over 450 members of the China-Japan-Korea Study Tour organized to visit the United States is on the Japanese-owned Osaka Company's Africa Maru, which is crossing the Pacific Ocean to Shanghai.

<h3 id="e139">Shipping Costs to India Rise Sharply <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Since the rise in gold and the decline in silver, the monetary systems of various countries in the world have been soaring, while the Chinese silver dollar has been falling. The prices of foreign goods arriving in China have increased almost without exception. Shipping companies in Shanghai have increased freight rates to foreign countries one after another, except for shipments to India. Now, the major Sino-Indian shipping companies, including British India Steam Navigation Company, Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Osaka Shosen Kaisha, and Jardine Matheson, have discussed increasing freight rates for Chinese goods to India. It is reported that it has been agreed to implement the increase from August 1st. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Freight rates to be increased: Within the Sino-Indian routes, there is a freight rate association in Shanghai. Member shipping companies cannot arbitrarily increase or decrease freight rates. Freight rates on this route have been collected in silver taels. Since the rise in gold, the Indian rupee has risen from 56 taels to 107 taels and 5 qian. Various companies, facing huge losses, have proposed increasing the freight rates for Shanghai export goods to Bombay and Calcutta from August 1st. Generally, the increase is about 20%, but some goods may increase by as much as 40%. For example, the freight rate for one ton of miscellaneous goods to India, originally set at 20 taels, is now increased to 27 taels. Silk, tea, and satin are also subject to increased rates. The shipping rate schedule is currently being revised and is expected to be revised and announced within a day or two.</p>
<p>Sharp decline in silk goods: Silk goods are the largest item of Chinese cargo shipped to India, with xiaofang (small textiles) accounting for the largest share of exports. Gao Pei and Samsung Foreign Firms in Shanghai specialize in procuring and transporting this commodity to Bombay and other ports. During the peak season, silk goods worth approximately 3 million yuan were shipped each month. Since the Gandhi movement in India, purchasers of Chinese goods in various parts of India have stopped purchasing and transporting them, and the export route for xiaofang has been blocked. Recently, there has been a sharp decline in the number of Chinese silk goods shipped to Bombay from Shanghai.</p>

<p>Yin Muqiang, a skin disease expert from Yushan, is currently a professor at the Nanyang and Southeast Medical Colleges and has a clinic at 34 Songshan Road. He graduated from Jiangsu Medical University early in his career and went to Japan for further study. He submitted a dissertation to Tokyo Imperial University, and the professors recently approved the granting of a medical doctorate. He was feted yesterday by relatives and friends at the Bank Association of this city. More than 100 people from the medical community, including Wang Qizhang and Cheng Muyi, attended. At the banquet, Dr. Jiang Zhenxun gave a speech, stating that Yin Muqiang is a talented scholar. He studied dermatology in Japan and, based on his findings, wrote a dissertation. Recently, it was approved by the professors of Tokyo Imperial University, granting him a medical doctorate, a well-deserved honor. However, it is regrettable that a talented person like Yin is like a thoroughbred horse in our country, but there is no Bole who can recognize him among the herd. In fact, our country is not without research institutions. Yin's alma mater, the former Jiangsu Medical University, was too limited in scope to allow him to fully develop his talents, so Yin had to go abroad. The government should take responsibility and find ways to promote academics.</p>

<p>Retrieving Wooden Boxes Led to a Sudden Explosion</p>
<p>Shipowner and Son Blown Up on the Spot</p>
<p>Two Shipmates Slightly Injured</p>
<p>At around 2:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, a loud noise was suddenly heard on the sea off Bailonggang outside Wusongkou. After investigation, it was learned that a large number of wooden boxes were floating on the sea surface at that location. Several sand dredging boats happened to pass by and saw them, so they rushed to retrieve the wooden boxes. Suddenly, an explosion occurred, resulting in a tragedy. Two boatmen were blown up on the spot and two others were injured. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Wooden Boxes Discovered on the Sea Surface  At around 2:00 p.m. yesterday, a large number of wooden boxes, hundreds of them, resembling soap boxes, were suddenly discovered on the sea surface about seventy miles outside Wusongkou, floating and drifting with the waves.</p>
<p>Boatmen Rushed to Retrieve Them Several Ningbo fishing boats, loaded with sand dredged from Dinghai, Zhejiang, and en route to Shanghai for sale, passed by the area. Seeing countless wooden boxes floating on the sea, the boatmen rushed to retrieve them. Just as they were rejoicing, the tragedy occurred as a result.</p>
<p>Wooden Boxes Exploded Suddenly  The boxes retrieved by the boatmen were all empty inside. The Jin Taimao sand dredging boat retrieved more than thirty wooden boxes, one of which was tightly sealed. Unexpectedly, while they were trying to open it, the box was slightly shaken and suddenly exploded. With a loud bang, the shipowner Ni A'ang and his son A'bang were instantly killed, and shipmates He Asheng and Zhi Abing were injured.</p>
<p>Shipowner's Flesh and Blood Flew Everywhere  Shipowner Ni A'ang was from Dinghai, 54 years old, and his son A'bang was 22 years old. When the box exploded, the father and son's flesh and blood flew everywhere, their intestines spilled out, and their limbs were broken. Blood splattered throughout the cabin, a horrific sight. At that time, shipmates He Bingsheng and Zhi Ajiong were fortunately in the stern cabin and only suffered minor injuries to their faces and other areas. After the accident, the shipmates, unable to do anything because the boat was at sea, left one person to watch the boat and another came to Song to inform a fellow villager, Mr. So-and-so, to report to Shanghai. The Ni shipowner's nephew arrived in Song yesterday morning, bought coffins and clothing, and hired a boat to go to collect the bodies for burial in their hometown.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Dye Merchant Xie Keming Kidnapped <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Kidnapped on His Way Home for Lunch</p>
<p>A Car Was Parked on the Roadside in Advance</p>
<p>At around 12:30 p.m. yesterday, a kidnapping case occurred near Jiangxi Road and Sijing Road. The kidnapped person was Xie Keming, a native of Ningbo, who served as the director of the dye department at De Fu Foreign Firm at 68 Sichuan Road. His family lived at Renjihao, 630 Dongqipan Street. In addition to working at De Fu Foreign Firm, Xie also ran his own dye business. At around 12:15 p.m. yesterday, Xie Keming took his private chartered car from 68 Sichuan Road to the warehouse, preparing to return to Renjihao on Dongqipan Street for lunch. Unexpectedly, when the car reached the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Sijing Road, they saw a car parked on the east side of the road. As Xie's car was about to return to the car, suddenly three men came forward. One of them held a pistol, forcing the carter to stop moving forward. The two bandits went straight to the car seat and dragged Xie down. Because of the excessive force, the car cushion was also pulled down. After Xie was forced out of the car, he was immediately taken into the car by the bandits and sped west along Sijing Road. In a hurry, the carter was unable to do anything and only saw that the kidnappers' car number was 1750. After receiving the news, the Central Police immediately sent detectives to investigate, but there were no clues for a while. However, it was found that the kidnappers' license plate code was actually forged. Xie had worked at De Fu Foreign Firm for many years, and his family also lived in Shanghai. Xie's carter, Wang A'er, said that the bandit with the gun was wearing a suit, and the car was a black convertible.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau issued an order yesterday, stating: "It is found that the table of kidnapping cases submitted by the First Section from various districts has been reviewed. From February 27th to May 6th, there are more than 30 unsolved cases. The table has been copied and circulated to the respective districts and teams, ordering them to check the listed industries under their jurisdiction and urging their subordinates to intensify their efforts to arrest the perpetrators. The respective district chiefs are also responsible for all cases in their respective districts and should urge the police detectives to investigate and arrest the perpetrators, offering rewards based on the severity of the case. Within one month, the district chiefs should check the listed cases in their respective districts, as well as any kidnapping incidents that occur thereafter, and submit a detailed report on each case, outlining the investigation process and indicating whether it has been solved or not. The subordinate police officers should also be investigated for their arrest achievements, and their performance should be evaluated and reported accordingly. However, more than a month has passed, and only a few cases have been solved in the various districts, while more than 20 new cases have occurred in the past month. The district chiefs have not yet submitted the reports as ordered, which is a disregard for official orders. The previous order is hereby reiterated, and the respective districts and teams are ordered to immediately urge their subordinates to intensify their efforts to arrest the perpetrators of the new and old cases under their jurisdiction, and to capture the stolen goods and real criminals as many as possible. At the same time, a detailed list of the new and old cases should be submitted, outlining the investigation process, and reported to the respective district chiefs.

<p>The local silk and satin dyeing industry, due to the encroachment of non-industry dyeing workshops on boundaries, which harms labor and capital, has had the industry's labor representatives, the Shanghai Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry Union and the Shanghai Silk and Cloth Dyeing Workers Union, and the capital representatives, the Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry Association, jointly petition in Beijing and send telegrams urging relief. It is heard that the Central Party Headquarters has replied with a document stating, "Received.

<h3 id="e154">The Third Day of the National Products Emporium <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the third day of operation for the China National Products United Emporium. Although the weather was scorching, those who went to buy and visit were still very enthusiastic, especially at sunset. Therefore, the overall business of the emporium was quite considerable. Because the emporium is spacious and the layout is novel, it is quite attractive. In addition, the participating manufacturers are all well-known factories in the country, and their products, such as the steel pipe beds and medical equipment of the Dahua Iron Factory, the enamelware of the Zhonghua Enamel Factory, the instruments of the Science Instrument Hall, the celluloid toys of the Dachina, Dazhonghua, and Central factories, the iron utensils of the Gongping Steel Factory, the rubber shoes of the Dazhonghua and Chunhua factories, the brandy of the Zhangyue Brewing Company, the velvet carpets of the Tongcheng Textile Factory, the serge wool of the Dahua Wool Factory, and the Fujian lacquerware of the Hequn Factory, are all outstanding national products that can compete with imported goods. Therefore, the viewers praised them and happily bought them. It is heard that the emporium, in order to be serious about national products and conduct strict screening, has started to organize a review committee to review the products of various factories, so as to distinguish the superior from the inferior and give rewards and punishments to encourage them. In addition, the emporium's propaganda section has been editing and distributing more than 10,000 copies of the Emporium Daily in the emporium every day, and it is still not enough. This shows the large number of visitors.</p>
<p>Although the China National Products United Emporium was initiated by Zhang Zilian, the internal planning and management relied entirely on the careful planning of the design committee members Yu Hualong, Zhang Yichen, Yu Zhongxian, Hu Fengxiang, and Zhang Henghai. Now that the emporium has been successfully opened, Mr. Yu and others believe that since the emporium has been fortunately opened, they can resign from their positions as design committee members. Yesterday, they specially sent a letter to Mr. Zhang, expressing their resignation from the committee.</p>

<p>A part of the female child workers in the fine yarn section of the Rihua Yarn Factory in Lujia Ferry, Pudong, recently demanded that the factory increase wages because the price of rice was soaring, everything was expensive, and life was extremely difficult. The request was not met, so they went on strike unanimously during the night shift last Saturday. The day before yesterday, Sunday, the factory was closed, and yesterday, during the day shift, in addition to the fine yarn section, the coarse yarn section also rose up in response. As a result, all the workers in the factory, due to the associated relationship, had no work to do and went on strike one after another. The unrest has not yet been resolved.</p>

<p>A 15% Increase Starting from July 1st</p>
<p>The union at the British American Tobacco Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, believes that the recent rise in the value of gold and decline in the value of silver, as well as the soaring prices, have made it difficult for workers to make a living. In order to take into account the suffering of the workers, it was decided at the 39th executive committee meeting to demand that the factory universally increase wages. The union yesterday morning dispatched representatives Gu Ruofeng, Chen Peide, and Ye Huibing, together with Municipal Party Department representative Wu Jiaze and Social Affairs Bureau representative Qiu Peihao, to formally negotiate with the factory. As a result, starting from July 1st, all workers in the factory will universally receive a 15% wage increase. The union has notified all workers.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Chen Yuxi's Concubine Comes to Shanghai to Sue for Inheritance <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Accuses Eldest Son Chen Zhongshan</p>
<p>Husband Died Without Providing Support</p>
<p>Submits Three Requests</p>
<p>The Court Hopes for Reconciliation</p>
<p>Chen Yuxi, a native of Zhenhai, had a large commercial business in Shanghai during his lifetime, including the Bao Chengyuji and Lao Fengxiang silver shops on Nanjing Road, as well as the Housheng, Juyuan, Yisheng, and Sanbei freight forwarding companies, and the Dongyang Nanhua Zhuang. Chen had shares in all of these businesses. After Chen's death, the above-mentioned businesses and other properties he left behind were worth no less than 200,000 yuan, all of which were controlled by his eldest son, Chen Zhongshan. During Yuxi's lifetime, he had not only one wife. There is also a Du family member, who also gave birth to two sons and one daughter, who have been living in the countryside of his hometown. The Du family member is now forty-four years old, and her children are gradually growing up. They need funds for schooling and marriage. Because the eldest son Zhongshan does not provide support, she brought her children from her hometown to Shanghai and hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to sue Zhongshan in the Special District Court, requesting a division of the inheritance. Her complaint states: "It has been ten years since my late husband Yuxi passed away. During this time, I have supported the family and raised the children, all by myself. I have truly endured hardship. Although my late husband established a will during his lifetime, it was based on the defendant's own opinion, because at that time my late husband was already in his twilight years and did not want to worry about anything. The defendant took control of all the properties, which were worth about 200,000 yuan. The defendant took this opportunity to establish a will. I am a woman and do not know how to read. I have never seen the will and do not know its contents. The defendant has also not made the will public, so it is difficult to list all the properties. However, as far as I know, the Bao Chengyuji and Lao Fengxiang silver shops, the Housheng, Juyuan, Yisheng, and Sanbei freight forwarding companies, and the Dongyang Nanhua store all have shares that have been swallowed up. There are also many more that I do not know about. After my late husband's death, the defendant did not bring me to live in Shanghai, but left me in a poor and remote village. He did not care about his half-siblings. They are now in urgent need of funds for schooling and marriage. I have repeatedly reasoned with him, but the defendant has turned a deaf ear. This is unbearable. Therefore, I request that the defendant be summoned to court and ordered to (1) hand over the will, (2) disclose the detailed accounts of the shares of the various shops left behind, and (3) fairly divide the inheritance." Based on the complaint, the court issued a warrant ordering officials to summon the defendant to appear in court at 241 Baoyufang, South Chengdu Road, for trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Yi opened the court. The defendant Chen Zhongshan did not appear. According to his representative lawyer, the defendant suffers from mental illness and therefore could not appear. The plaintiff's lawyer Zhan Jifeng also stated that the subject matter of the lawsuit has not yet been determined. Once the amount of property is clear, the litigation fees will be paid in accordance with the regulations. Judge Yang believed that this kind of family dispute is best resolved through reconciliation, and advised both lawyers to go out and mediate. Lawyer Zhan said that he would abide by the court's goodwill and requested that the case be postponed. If reconciliation fails, he would request that the defendant be summoned to court, because there are many factual issues in dispute. The defendant's lawyer also presented three copies of the will to the court. Judge Yang then ordered the hearing to be rescheduled and allowed the plaintiff to copy the will for study.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Shen Xinyi and Two Others Acquitted <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Kidnapping of Xi Xiangquan, a Resident of Er Tu Township, Nanhui County, Caused a Sensation</p>
<p>Xi Xiangquan, a resident of Er Tu Township, Nanhui County, was kidnapped, involving his brother Xi Xianglin and others. The local court has investigated and made a judgment. Xi Xiangquan was kidnapped in September of the 17th year of the Republic of China and redeemed at the end of October. At the end of that year, Cao Yongqi, the director of the Nanhui County Public Security Bureau, colluded with a local tycoon named Yang, intending to extort a huge sum of money from Xi's brother, Xi Xianglin. First, he made someone suggest it, and then, on New Year's Eve, he arrested Xi Xianglin. On the way, he met Shen Xinyi and Tan Xinglou, who were also arrested for violating the night curfew. Xi Xianglin offered to pay a ransom, but Xi refused. After being taken to the bureau, they were initially treated well in the receiving and dispatch office and persuaded to pay a bribe. Later, they were forced to confess to being communists by using torture. Xi and the other two refused to confess. Then, they were frightened into reporting the kidnapping of Xi Xiangquan. At that time, County Magistrate Shen Yuzhong was on leave in Shanghai, and Cao Yongqi colluded with Section Chief Liu of the county government. They were suddenly transferred to the county detention center and then brought back to the Public Security Bureau, where they were tortured to force a confession. After half a month, they were sent to the county government. Shen Xinyi and others repeatedly appealed to the Judicial Yuan, the Ministry of Justice, the provincial government, and the High Court, accusing the county magistrate of dereliction of duty and Cao Yongqi of abuse of torture and violation of the law. The High Court approved the transfer of the case to the Shanghai Local Court for trial. Prosecutor Zhu Jun first investigated and found it suspicious, and filed a public prosecution. Judge Qian Chengjun then investigated and interrogated Xi Xianglin, who was defended by lawyer Wei Wangzeng. Shen Xinyi also hired lawyer Wang Youlin to defend him, and Tan Xinglou was also assigned lawyer Wang Zengxian by Judge Qian. The debate was held in court a few days ago, and Prosecutor Wang Sixian attended and stated that although the case had been prosecuted, after careful examination of the entire file, the three defendants in this case were actually wronged, and the plaintiff's claims were unreliable. Yesterday morning, the judgment was announced: Shen Xinyi, Tan Xinglou, and Xi Xianglin were all acquitted. Judge Qian then warned the three defendants to be safe and abide by the law outside and not to cause trouble. Thus, the scandalous kidnapping case that caused a sensation came to an end. It is heard that the real kidnappers, Wang Yinglong and two others, have been executed by firing squad in Nanhui County for other cases.</p>
<h3 id="e159">The Zhen Fengtai Lawsuit Was Opened Again Yesterday <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>New Store Uses Old Account Books</p>
<p>Zhu Mu, a native of Hubei, and Zhang Binghui, the manager of the Yu Fengtai Hotel, and Hu Baohua, Zhou Maolin, and others opened the Zhen Fengtai Shaoxing Hotel on North Sichuan Road. Zhu Mu then filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai Local Court to split the shares, claiming that the accounts were unclear and that he was unwilling to suffer losses. After the lawsuit, Zhu Mu withdrew from the court and was discharged from the hospital. Wang Jingqing then smeared Zhu's face with feces, so Zhu twisted Wang Jingqing and brought him to court for detention, and Zhang and others were released on bail. The two lawsuits have been going on for two sessions, but Zhu Mu also sued Zhang Binghui and others for the rent of the house where they opened the store, which is the third lawsuit. The first lawsuit to split the shares has not yet been resolved. During the court hearing, it was found that the account books were all altered or re-bound. The court then appointed accountant Zhao Zuwei to appraise the account books, and the report stated that there were indeed flaws in the account books. Zhu Mu then filed a complaint with the Procuratorate, accusing Zhang Binghui, Hu Baohua, Zhou Maolin, Hu Guoan, and others of forging documents and instigating Wang Jingqing to publicly insult him with filthy objects. The prosecutor then released the defendants on bail and filed a public prosecution, which is the fourth lawsuit. The lawsuits have been going on for ten months. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhao of the Criminal Court opened the trial. Zhu Mu testified, "I and them opened the store together. At that time, the capital was 2,000 yuan. I invested 500 yuan. Hu Baohua was appointed as the manager, Zhang Binghui as the supervisor, Zhou Maolin as the assistant, and I was responsible for checking the accounts. After opening in December of the 17th year of the Republic of China, I repeatedly asked them to check the accounts, but they refused to allow me to see them, so I was suspicious. In March of the 18th year, I requested to withdraw my shares. They said that I had to wait until the Dragon Boat Festival, and then said that I had to wait for half a year to settle the accounts. Unexpectedly, by the Mid-Autumn Festival, they did not return the money to me. On the contrary, they said that the 2,000 yuan of capital had been almost completely lost and that I still had to find money. But Hu Baohua is the manager, but he is not in the store. He only entrusted his father to act as his agent. His father is a Taoist priest. How can he manage the store affairs and not allow me to check the accounts? After the lawsuit, the first instance judge did not understand, so I appealed. Judge Zhao opened the court and ordered me to take the account books for the appointed accountant to appraise. There were indeed acts of forgery, so I ordered the criminal case to be resolved first. But they swallowed my shares and stuffed feces in me. I really suffered too much. I ask for an investigation." Zhang Binghui testified, "I live at 1793 Hongkou. Zhu Mu was checking the accounts in the store every day. The accounts were managed by the manager. The appraisal by accountant Zhao Zuwei was a correct procedure. There are some flaws. We are all illiterate and cannot do the accounts. The capital of 2,000 yuan was used up due to large expenses, and there was a shortage of more than 600 yuan." The official asked, "Why are the account books fake?" He replied, "Because of economic reasons, we bought old account books and account books that had been used in old stores." The official said, "How can a new store not even be able to afford account books? This is a joke." At this point, he asked Hu Baohua, who testified that he was the manager. He asked, "Why are the account books fake?" He replied, "Because the capital is small, we used old books, so there is the appearance of being unbound and scribbled." The official asked, "How can a person who does business not know the rules? An account book only costs a few cents. How can a store owner not afford it?" He ordered him to step down and then asked Zhou Maolin, who testified the same as before. At this point, the accountants Zhang Xingsheng and Hu Guoan also testified that because the capital in the store was small, for economic reasons, they either used old account books from elsewhere or bought old account books from old goods stalls and unbound them for use. The official believed that the facts of the case were clear, but the account books had not yet been transferred from the civil court, so he ordered that the debate be rescheduled for the 28th of this month, and then ordered them to leave the court.</p>

They reported to the Third District and sent detectives to arrest the suspects Xue Youliu, Sun Benzi, Yang Dacai, Xue Kuaizi, and Chen San one after another. They seized a small amount of stolen goods. Xue confessed that the main criminals were Zhu Xiaosanzi Xiaogou and Sun Xiaosanzi, the younger brother of Sun Benzi. After investigation by the district, it was learned that Yang Dacai was also the main criminal in the case. He ordered them to be detained together pending the arrest of the remaining criminals for further investigation.</p>

<p>At 8:30 PM the previous evening, a car with license plate number 4970 sped along Rue Robert, striking and running over a six-year-old boy named Qiu A-mao from Ningbo, crushing his skull. He died before medical assistance could be administered. This was reported in yesterday's edition.

Meanwhile, the boy's body was transported to the coroner's office on Route Frelupt. Yesterday morning, Qiu Kai-fa, the father of the deceased, was summoned from No. 1002 Tongyi Lane on Rue Robert, and he, along with the driver, were taken to the coroner's office. Subsequently, Xu Mei, a prosecutor from the Special District Court, arrived at the office to examine the body. After questioning, Wang Hai-gen was ordered to be detained and handed over to the court for questioning. Qiu Kai-fa was allowed to take the boy's body away for burial after signing a guarantee.</p>

<p>Li Yong-zhi's seven-month-old son, from No. 1 Jingde Lane, Huangjiaque Road, has been missing for nearly 20 days since being kidnapped by bandits. The details have been reported in this newspaper several times. Yesterday, according to friends close to Mr. Li, many of the reports in the newspapers are not consistent with the facts. Mr. Li has been working hard to make a living for years, has never held a prominent position, has no savings, and has no grudges. After this incident occurred, not only is Mr. Li deeply confused, but all his friends are also baffled. It is possible that the bandits have another Mr. Li in mind or that it was a mistake.</p>

<p>Min Long-yin, a 34-year-old man from Huzhou, used to be in the mat business, but is now unemployed. On the 18th, he checked into a room at the Nanyang Hotel at No. 15 Rue des Soeurs in the French Concession. Due to the pressure of economic hardship, he suddenly had a desperate idea. On the evening of the 19th, he ingested an anesthetic solution to commit suicide. When the poison took effect, the tea room attendant, Song Fa-lin, found out, entered the room, and saw Min foaming at the mouth and unable to speak. He immediately reported to the Xiaodongmen Police Station, who sent Min to Renji Hospital. Because the poison had already taken effect deeply, the rescue was ineffective and he died. The hospital notified the police station, who ordered investigators to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall coroner's office. They informed Min Jing-ru, the deceased's uncle (who works at the Tongchang Store in Dadongmen), to come. Yesterday, the Criminal Division of the French Police Station reported to Judge Zhu Cheng of the French Concession Court, who examined the body and confirmed that the deceased had died from poisoning. He ordered the uncle to prepare a coffin and collect the body for burial. After the examination, the body was hastily placed in a coffin and taken to the Huzhou Guild Hall Bing House for temporary storage.</p>

<p>The Two Men Should Be Thoroughly Investigated</p>
<p>Around 1:00 AM yesterday morning, a young woman was seen pacing back and forth on the Puxi side of the Santai Wharf in the Nanshi district, and then she jumped into the river. As the tide was rising, the woman immediately sank to the bottom of the river after jumping. The boatmen nearby heard the sound, looked around, and quickly used bamboo poles to rescue her. However, because she had swallowed too much water, her abdomen was swollen and her breathing was faint. They performed surgery to drain the water from her stomach and then gave her ginger soup. The woman gradually woke up and regained her senses. Zhang Guang-han, the guard on duty at the 17th post, was called to the scene and took her back to the first section of the first district. The section chief questioned her and she gave her name as Qiu Mei-mei, 21 years old, from Pudong. She said she lived at No. 11, south of the Xiaohuo train station in Yangsi Bridge, Pudong. Her parents had both died early. She usually relied on her older brother, Qiu Gen-sheng, for support. Because her younger sister, Xiao-mei, who is only nine years old, had recently contracted scabies, she took a ferry to Puxi on the 12th of this month to buy medicine for sores from the Taishan Hall medicinal materials store in the city of Dadongmen. Then, she went to visit relatives at Dananmen. She left around 6:00 PM and then went to Dongjiadu Wharf to</p>

<p>board a ferry. After arriving in Pudong, it was already late and the Xiaohuo train had stopped running, so she had no way to return home. She planned to walk, but unexpectedly, on the way, she suddenly encountered two men she did not know who blocked her path and flirted with her. She ignored them, but they forcibly took her to Puxi. She knew that they were not good people and quickly tried to call for help, but was afraid of being harmed, so she reluctantly let them take her. Later, she was lodged at a hotel outside the old North Gate. After one night, she was still watched and was not allowed to move. For nine days, she had been thinking about escaping, but could not find a good opportunity. Around 10:00 PM last night (the day before yesterday), one of the men left to raise money because they had run out. The other man was fast asleep in bed, and she had a chance to escape. She immediately sneaked out of the hotel and hired a car to Dongjiadu in the Nanshi district. When she was about to board a boat to cross the river, she suddenly remembered that it had been many days since she left home. She had been indecently insulted by them for no reason. How could she face her family? Furthermore, her family must be very panicked because she had not returned home for many days. If she returned home late at night, it would inevitably cause suspicion. Who would speak out for the injustice she suffered? At this point, she was in a dilemma. While she was pondering silently, the tide was rising and she suddenly felt clear-headed. After a long time of silence, she felt that there was no fun in this troubled world. It would be better to commit suicide by jumping into the river to wash away the accumulated resentment. So she went to the banks of the Santai Wharf and, taking advantage of people not paying attention, jumped in to end her life. Unexpectedly, she was rescued by the boatmen and taken into custody by the police. After speaking, she cried bitterly, which made the viewers sad. The section chief considered the case to be a suicide attempt and prepared a document to be sent to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Escaped Twice and Never Returned</p>
<p>Ticket inspector Requests Divorce</p>
<p>Liu Tian-cheng, a native of Yancheng who works as a ticket inspector for the streetcar company in the International Settlement, lives at No. 145 Xiangyan Bridge, Hongkou. Ten years ago, he married Xu Qi-bao, a 20-year-old woman, through a matchmaker (Xu is now 30 years old). However, Xu's nature was promiscuous and she did not abide by the virtues of a wife. She ran away several times. In August of the 17th year of the Republic, Xu ran away from her husband. Liu Tian-cheng found out where she was hiding and reported her to the police, who arrested the adulterer and adulteress and transferred them to the local court. Liu did not want to pursue the matter further, so the man and woman were released on bail. In April of last year, Xu lured and abducted a Wang-surname child, and was arrested. After investigation and trial, the court sentenced her to six months in prison. She was released in October. On the afternoon of April 27th of this year, Xu took the opportunity to run away again. Liu Tian-cheng could not bear the burden and filed a divorce lawsuit with the local court, stating that the defendant, Liu Xu (i.e., Xu Qi-bao) had committed all kinds of evil deeds and violated criminal laws, such as adultery and abduction, all of which were documented in the court. This time, she relapsed and ran away again, taking with her 37 yuan in silver, two gold rings, one pair of gold bracelets, and dozens of pieces of clothing, disappearing without a trace. He reported this to the Fourth District First Section Police Station for record. Because she is now hiding and not showing her face, he fears that she is with bandits and that accidents may occur. Moreover, with the defendant's behavior, it is difficult to live together until old age, so he has to divorce her to avoid future troubles. Yesterday morning, Judge Du held a hearing. Because the defendant's address was unknown, she could not be served and did not appear in court. Only the plaintiff, Liu Tian-cheng, appeared and stated that he was 46 years old and currently worked as a streetcar ticket inspector in the British Concession, and stated the previous situation, requesting a divorce judgment. The judge, after receiving the testimony, ordered him to leave and await consideration.</p>

<p>Huang Gang Fang Dan-chi, who served as an official in Hongdu, passed away last autumn. His son, Da-can, claimed that his father had an inheritance of about 200,000 yuan, consisting of savings passbooks and gold pounds and gold leaves in various banks in Shanghai, which were stolen by his father's concubine, Deng, and handed over to her father, Deng Guan-nan, who then transferred them to Wang Shu-tang for safekeeping. He sued Deng and others in court. At the end of the first trial, the court ruled against the plaintiff, Fang Da-can. He then filed an appeal, which was also heard in court, and there was a verbal debate. The details of the case have been reported in the newspaper many times. Yesterday morning was the date for the second instance of the case to be announced. Both parties, accompanied by their respective lawyers, arrived at the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Subsequently, Judge Song Zhi-sheng of the Criminal Court, along with Judges Du Fu-yao and Gao Jun-xiang, took their seats in the first courtroom. They first briefly questioned both parties about their names, ages, and birthplaces, and then Judge Song stood up and read the judgment, the main text of which was that the appeal was rejected. After the judgment, Fang and others returned home.</p>

<p>Nearly Sold, Fortunately No Patron</p>
<p>The girl, Yang A-mei, is only fifteen years old and originally from Shanghai. Because her parents died in Shanghai when she was five years old, she went to Suzhou to live with her maternal grandmother. Ten years passed. On the 21st of last month, a woman named Ni You-shi from Haimen saw the girl in Suzhou and used sweet words to lure her, saying that if she came to Shanghai with her, she would send her to school, hire a nanny to serve her, and that she had a lot of gold jewelry that she would give to her in the future. A-mei was indeed deceived by the woman and escaped to Shanghai with her. The woman originally wanted to sell the girl, but she has been lingering until now and still has no patron. At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, the woman took the girl out again. While walking on Kunming Road, detective Yang Xi-chen saw them and felt that their appearance was suspicious, so he questioned them. The woman felt guilty and answered evasively. The girl repented and told the truth. Yang brought them both to the Huishan Police Station. Yesterday morning, Feng, a judge, summoned them to the Special District Court. A-mei described in detail how she had been abducted, saying that after arriving in Shanghai, she had no fixed residence and was not allowed to go out alone every day. Now she desperately wanted to return to Suzhou. When questioned, Ni You-shi said that she was originally acquainted with the girl's maternal grandmother, and that she had informed her of her bringing the girl to Shanghai, and that it was not abduction for the purpose of selling her. The court ordered the girl to be temporarily detained at the Jiliang Institute, and the defendant to be held for a rescheduled hearing to clarify the facts.</p>

<p>Shangyu - The Shangyu Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association has been reorganized under the enthusiastic maintenance of He Wu-liang, Wang Zhi-xiang, Tian Qi-kang, Xie Hui-yuan, Feng Bu-qing, Chen Qi-kun, Wang Guo-quan, and others. The Association has been developing steadily. For fellow villagers who are socially backward or poor and unable to return home, they will buy boat tickets and provide funds to return to their hometowns. If women from rural areas are abducted and escape to Shanghai, the Association will do its best to investigate and persuade them to return to their hometowns. Fellow villagers are deeply grateful. This summer, a large number of medicinal waters and furuncle plasters were prepared, and Chinese medicine doctors Jin Bao-kang, Xiao Bao-quan, Luo Cha-sheng, Xuan Ming-zhai, Cai Wen-xian, and other famous doctors were hired to be stationed at the Association to provide treatment. For the poor, medicine expenses are also provided. There are several cases every day. They are currently preparing the Second Free Primary School and are actively carrying it out. It is also reported that the Association intends to move the Association to the concession due to inconvenient transportation. The Standing Committee Wang Zhi-xiang has been appointed to find a suitable building in the concession for relocation and office work.</p>
<p>Jiangxi - The Jiangxi Shanghai Business and Friendship Association was established in the 14th year of the Republic. Since its establishment, the Association has been developing rapidly. Because the original Association was not enough for office work, all members of the general meeting decided to purchase a base to build the Association. As for the funds, in addition to donations from members, they also received special support from the Eight Trade Unions and the Tea Industry. Huang Bao-xiang, Tu Zhong-xuan, Zhang Fa-bao, Zheng Er-zang, Lü Zhe-gong, Liu Fang-gu, Huang Guo-wen, Jin Rong-zhang, Zeng Chun-sheng, Wang Yi-yuan, and others have been designated to be responsible for handling it.</p>

<p>Sauce and Wine Industry - The Sauce and Wine Association of this city has been actively carried out since it was ordered to reorganize. Yesterday, the inaugural meeting of the reorganized association was held at the association's venue in the Yimiao Temple in the city. Gao Xi-zhong, a representative of the Municipal Party Department, Wang Bao-ao, a representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, Sun Ming-qi, a representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and more than 100 member representatives attended. Zhang Da-lian, Cheng Geng-li, and Luo Fang-huai were elected as the presidium. The meeting was held as usual. The chairman reported the purpose of the meeting. The representatives of the superior agencies made speeches. Zhang Da-lian, Shen Wei-ya, Shu Sheng, Cheng Geng-li, Chen Jun-kang, Luo Fang-huai, Zhang Ji-chang, Zhang Zhao-kang, Zhu De-bao, Shen Jin-shu, Zhu Shun-chen and other 11 people were elected as executive members.</p>
<p>Paint Industry - The Shanghai Paint Industry Association held an election committee meeting in the auditorium of the Association at Xuexiangdi at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss the urgent need to reorganize and merge the furniture industry. More than 50 people attended. Zhang Fu-kang was elected chairman. After reporting the purpose of the meeting, Min Xing-chu, a clerk representative, said that since the Association had been instructed by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to promulgate the reorganization order of various superior agencies, it had been actively carrying out various reorganization matters and spared no effort. At present, the external work has been completed, but the wood industry is rushing to guide it, which is a waste of effort. Although the registration of the roster has been completed, the previous associations of merchants and people and all the procedures were kept by Cai Lan-zhou. It should be transferred immediately so as not to have no basis and start a new stove. Repeatedly, he asked him to discuss it by letter but ignored it. He should ask you to find a way to guide him as soon as possible, so as not to waste time and hinder the progress of the overall situation of the Association. After discussion by the merchants, it was decided to send another letter to urge him and another method would be determined after his reply. Then, Ma Zhi-gang expressed his opinion, saying that there are no less than 100 wood companies in the south and north. They have been contacted and established associations again and again, but they have been suspended halfway and have not been able to establish a sound organization. Now that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has issued the Hope Order, we should reorganize according to law and merge with various paint industries to form a legal association. In the future, the rights and happiness of our industry will be unlimited. However, someone must be responsible for the procedures for joint assembly in progress so that it can be established as scheduled. The organization committee should be elected to take special responsibility. Zhang Fu-kang, Ling You-qiao, Zhou Shan-qing, Zhao Hong-zhen, Huang Shou-chun, Zhang Zhong-fu, Ma Zhi-gang, Cai Lan-zhou, Cai You-qing, Zhao Yun-shan, Shen Qi-wen, Ma Ji-liang, Wu Zhong-shan, Wang Yong-lian, Wu Ren-yao, Zhu Ju-ping, Zhang Ming-qia, and Xu Guo-qing were elected as the reorganization committee of the wood industry to share the guidance and joint affairs in the north and south. The crowd unanimously agreed. Then, Lin Zhi-zhou, a guest, gave a lecture on the joint organization methods of industrial and commercial groups and the various inherent rights that should be enjoyed after the establishment. His earnest and detailed analogy was appropriate. Hearing this, the audience was moved. At this point, the bell rang six times, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>Letter Received</p>
<p>To the Editor-in-Chief of Shen Bao, respectfully, I, the undersigned, having read your newspaper's local news section of the 19th of this month, which contained a section about the hotel owner Qilin raping a young girl named Amao, after reading it in detail, was deeply shocked. Upon investigation, the undersigned's name is Xi Lun, which is known in the neighbourhood, and is a legitimate businessman. Regarding this shameless act of rape, my conscience cannot allow it. The report published by your newspaper is not a factual account. The publication of this matter greatly affects the reputation of the undersigned. I request the Editor-in-Chief of your newspaper to immediately correct the record and publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" section. With gratitude, to the esteemed Editor-in-Chief of Shen Bao, Zhang Xi Lun, July 19, 1920</p>

<p>Chapter Forty: The American Novel</p>
<p>During the latter half of his long career, the formal head of American literature, a friend and discerning mentor of Mark Twain, and a patron of promising young talent, was William Dean Howells. He was a delightful character, an artist to the fingertips, and a master of style from his first work to his last. To find a clumsy sentence in Howells would be as surprising as finding one in Flaubert or Anatole France. However, Howells was timid, lacking force. The "careful realism" he preached and practiced was a carefulness that was not an exquisite artistic restraint used by intelligence to subdue passion, because Howells had nothing to be careful about. Therefore, it was an empty carefulness. Of his many novels—for he was a diligent and extremely meticulous writer—three or four approached the realm of genius. "A Modern Instance," depicting the plight of ordinary little people suffering from petty troubles, was something entirely new in American novels. "The Rise of Silas Lapham" was probably the first novel with a common businessman as the protagonist. His later novel, "The Kentons," is one of his best works. In my opinion, even consistent admirers of Howells cannot fully appreciate its inherent value. He believed himself to be influenced by Tolstoy, but in his work, the traces of Tolstoy are no more evident than the influence of Fielding on Hawthorne. Howells was an admirable reader and wrote beautiful essays about books. Whether or not you agree with his opinions, you can always see a scholar with comprehensive knowledge in him.</p>
<p>America's greatest novelist, with the exception of birth, can hardly be said to be American. This is Henry James, who spent most of his mature life in Europe, and whose views were entirely European and worldly. He was one of the giants of 20th-century prose and an outstanding artist with only one important limitation. The so-called important limitation is that he had an incurable, but not despicable due to his extremely generous and sympathetic nature, snobbery. He was an intellectual "isolationist" with no knowledge of life except what could be learned in the reception rooms of grand hotels, art museums, and, needless to say, well-stocked libraries. Despite that limitation, he was a profound student of human character, in scientific terms, a psychologist. Many of the characters he portrayed were Americans in Europe, hence he was called the inventor of the international novel. However, a true international novelist should have played both sides and shown the Europeans in America as well. But Europeans in America were mostly laborers, while Americans in Europe were mostly idlers, and that was the class James knew. His works are divided into two periods. Belonging to the first period is the beautiful novel "Roderick Hudson," with a weak-willed American sculptor as the protagonist; the story of the pure and poignant ingenuous American girl who does not understand the complex morality and immorality of the ancient world, "Daisy Miller;" the somewhat pungent study of American brazenness and vitality and philistinism (the word "philistine" was a favorite of James, he used it so much that it became philistine itself) and a beautiful spiritual tragedy, "The Portrait of a Lady," with a truly tragic character as the protagonist, an uncomplicated but intelligent and honest person placed in an overly contrived situation; and "The American."</p>
<p>As James entered his second period, he became increasingly skillful and complex, pleasing his small group of devoted admirers and displeasing those who did not understand his technique. That technique was the complete objectification of characters. The people in the story move in very ordinary situations, or extremely difficult circumstances, in which one by one, their characteristics or traits flash out. If the reader reads the novel from beginning to end, then he will discover that the novelist has built a complete human character for himself. Two novels that illustrate that technique are "The Wings of the Dove" and "The Golden Bowl." James in his novels proceeds slowly and spends many pages to follow the development of a motive. However, he was also a master of the short story, and a volume containing eight to ten of his best short stories is entirely unrivaled in modern literature. He was also a sharp critic of French and English literature. Had he not turned to novels, he would have been ranked among the foremost writers of literary essays.</p>
<p>The story of a nation is not only narrated by rare talented writers, but also by many smaller writers, whose works, taken together, constitute that social history. America is necessarily divided into intellectual states. How can one know the farmer of Vermont and the farmer of Georgia? Two or three of those second-rate storytellers occupy a quasi-immortal place in the social record preserved by the art of the novel. The well-known poet T. B. Aldrich wrote several moving short stories, depicting not much of American life, but in which there is a graceful and humorous art. The same is true of Frank Stockton. His most famous short story is "The Lady, or the Tiger?" Southern life is expressed in the novels of several writers of true talent. Cable found romantic material in the old Creole and black life of New Orleans. That black slave is a prominently immortal figure in Harriet Beecher Stowe's "Uncle Tom's Cabin." The important figure of the Central West is preserved in Edward Eggleston's "The Hoosier School-Master," one of the first American novels to carefully study the dialect (so to speak, because it was published several years before "Huckleberry Finn"). The people and landscapes of New England are depicted for all time in the delicate stories of Mary Wilkins Freeman and Sarah Orne Jewett. I know of no other work by an American writer that is superior to Freeman's "The Revolt of Mother" in writing about ordinary people.</p>

<p>The Joint Savings Society of Jin Cheng, Zhong Nan, and Da Lu Banks has established a Western District branch at No. 1 Carter Road (intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Carter Road). It opened yesterday (the 21st), and the depositors were extremely crowded. Most of the important figures in the local business community attended to offer their congratulations, making it a grand occasion. The amount of deposits received was also very enthusiastic, it is said.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Westside Paint Industry Association announced that the association's Standing Committee member Yin Runsheng, Executive Committee members Ding Fang'e, Tao Lianchun, Tao Zhongxiao, and more than ten others hosted Ma Shangjie and important staff members at the Du Yi Chu on Edward Road at 6:00 PM yesterday. During the banquet, Ma stood up and delivered a speech, roughly saying: "I am deeply grateful for the hospitality and grand banquet that you have shown me today. The association's affairs, from preparation to establishment, and from establishment to the present, have been deeply reliant on everyone's courage, enthusiasm, joint efforts, and concerted efforts to achieve satisfactory progress in gradually developing the common interests of the industry and gradually realizing them. I was previously nominated by everyone as one of the Standing Committee members, but I am deeply afraid that my shallow learning and limited experience will be insufficient to meet your expectations. The work and mission I bear must be based on the common interests of the association. Nothing else is to be considered. In the future, I deeply hope that everyone will work together to promote the association's affairs with unity and a genuine spirit." Next, Wang Shipeng stood up and gave a thank-you speech, roughly saying. During the banquet, everyone gathered together, and the clinking of glasses was quite a grand occasion for a time, it is said.</p>
<p>The United Machinery Factory on Route D'Ossi and Yangjia Dock Road announced that the factory has invented a new type of warp sizing machine, which is groundbreaking. This machine is flexible, precise, and ingenious. It can size both yarn and cloth. Its price is also low, and its output is especially fast. It can size 5,000 yards of warp yarn and cloth per day, which is most suitable for small-scale weaving factories. If this machine is available, imported single-yarn cloth will inevitably be rejected and eliminated on its own. The factory has scheduled a test run at 2:00 PM on July 22nd of the Gregorian calendar and sincerely invites people from all walks of life to come and visit. You are most welcome. The factory manufactures a wide variety of machines and has long been praised by the industrial and commercial communities, it is said.</p>
<p>Liang Chen Hao You She, located at the intersection of Beijing Road and Zhejiang Road, announced that it will be giving away 300,000 sample stationery envelopes starting today so that those who order printing can choose.
