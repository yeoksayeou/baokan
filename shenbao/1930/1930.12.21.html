<p>西康大吉寺與白利土司戰事</p>
<p>西康通訊西康北路甘孜縣屬之大吉喇嘛寺與白利土司因爭活佛轉世及遺産問題發生戰爭已有數月之久因雙方均有背景局部戰爭漸行牽動康藏全局雖經中央下令停止進攻戰事迄未了結茲將大吉寺之槪况與西藏之關係及此次發生戰爭之經過分述如下以告留心邊事者</p>
<p>大吉寺之概况查大吉喇嘛寺當初僅係三等喇嘛寺喇嘛人數不過數百名清末以還邊陲多事川藏戰事歲無寗日川軍勝則西進藏軍勝則東侵一進一退之間康民已不堪其苦而尤以喇嘛寺之富庶者無論漢藏兵至皆指爲通敵擄掠焚燬爲所欲爲以故頭二等大廟零落殆盡惟此區之大吉寺因善於周旋應付獨得無恙四方僧衆歸者日衆又因甘孜乃富庶之區該寺喇嘛利用廟産經營商業資本蒸蒸日上富甲一方久爲人所覬觎民國五年西康南路鄉城人民窺其財富曾聚集馬隊一千前往圍攻三晝夜卒被擊退該寺自此益擴充武力以禦外侮計全寺喇嘛一千八百餘人快槍二千餘支良馬二千餘匹平日不許外人入寺甘孜知事亦只敷衍而已</p>
<p>與西藏之關係甘孜縣爲川康邊總指揮管轄區其西去百餘里即係西　駐軍防地（按藏軍自民六東侵後其防地進至甘孜）達賴鑒於大吉寺之富庶及武力之雄厚又居西康北路咽喉之地深欲利用之以作東侵之根據地故不惜百計結納并供給金錢槍彈民十二年川邊鎭守使陳遐齡兵敗之時大吉寺將駐紥甘孜之少數川軍繳械即達賴慫恿之力從此達賴利用大吉寺之心益切常特派事員餽贈禮物賞賜喇嘛又凡該寺喇嘛到藏者均受優待該寺受此殊遇對於達賴當然五體投地矣</p>
<p>戰爭發生經過此次戰爭係大吉寺因一活佛歸位及遺産問題與當地白利土司發行衝突（按白利士司乃北路大土司之一雖曾經清趙爾豐改土歸流收回信印然當地人民仍多信仰）始則鄰近各土司保正從中調停繼則由甘孜縣長出而勸解均未得要領大吉寺方面因恃人强馬壯耀武揚威白利土司亦不肯示弱集合屬下僧民盡力抵抗本年八月中旬雙方哨兵衝突繼則正式宣戰大吉寺乃出其馬隊向白利村落進攻刧掠後並將房屋佔據白利見勢不敵乃乞援于西康常駐兵（按即劉文輝部下）駐兵久處荒僻之地清苦異常對於大吉寺之財富埀涎已久聞此消息欣然應允援助惟慮大吉寺喇嘛衆多槍彈充足又與西藏素有淵戰而不勝則失當局之威嚴戰而勝又恐藏方藉口護廟出而干涉爲愼重將事計乃先以公文通知駐防鄰近之藏軍說明大吉寺之不法擬派兵鎭壓請勿誤會藏軍覆文僅云此事在貴軍管轄區内敝軍不致誤會但請愼重辦理等語於是駐打箭爐之二十四軍馬旅長乃先後調遣軍隊數連并携帶大砲前往會同甘孜原有駐軍向大吉寺進攻詎料該寺喇嘛頗有訓練見官兵至并不示弱反攻數次並未失利又有駐德格藏軍供給子彈其勢益振官兵乃增加援兵大舉包圍以期殲滅大吉寺只得退而保守本寺堡壘一方向達賴請援達爲保護其東侵根據地起見乃電請中央轉令劉文輝制止駐康軍隊進攻惟該軍圍攻數月只以大吉寺保壘堅固毫無效果苟罷兵歸去不但損失未償亦且體面攸關故雖已奉中央命令依然調兵遣將以期獲勝但大吉寺之内外兩道圍墻寬約一丈高約二丈寺内儲蓄糧　足支三年深溝高壘以逸待勞官兵能否得勝尙屬疑問且藏軍近在咫尺所以不急于進援者一方面固欲利用中央下令制止一方面亦因大吉寺實力足以抵抗也如官兵增援不已則藏方必出兵援助於是則康藏全局轉入戰事漩渦西陲國防益將不可收拾且北路各縣因受戰爭影響各地商賈裏足不前生意極形蕭條康定稅收亦大爲减少漢藏商民均怨聲載道甚望中央再下嚴令停止軍事行動速謀正當解决也（十一月十五日）</p>

<p>衛斯理大學校ＷＥＳＬＥＹＡＮＣＯＬＬＥＧＥ設於美之梅根省校址占地六百餘畝屋舍新建規模弘敞設備完密面圖書館試騐室體育場大禮堂尤其是特别注重蓋爲德智體美四育之源泉也課程分敎育文學家政社會神學數理化體育法律政治等各學系而敎育文學家政社會神學等系學生較多每敎室懸時鐘校章規定學生遲到一分敎授必記出報辦公處敎師可遲到一刻然師生從未有遲到者</p>
<p>每一學系敎課嚴重自不待言而對於互助服務及鍛鍊體魄尤十分注意</p>
<p>（甲）互助服務的訓練每星期中三次祈禱會每次必講到互助服務的古事和原理無非抱基督精神（我役於人非役人者）的主義師以是敎生以是學涵泳而浸溉之久而久焉必能變氣質也我國近日固多熱心公益發見互助服務的事實然間亦有視地方公共利益等於窗前月瓦上霜而推出不管者時有目覩西國亦多自私自利之徒然社會上竊以猶太人目之（亡國奴之代名詞）環境之種因不同而民族之結果攸異司敎育職者盍悉心一研究之</p>
<p>（乙）鍛鍊體魄之强迫球類和徒手操當然認眞演習而游泳池之實地試騐視爲主要科目校長之提倡敎授之訓練分數之鼓勵同學之奮勉加以池中之設備精緻引人入勝身處其間對於鳧水興會於不知不覺之中自油然而生美人無論矣日本人大都以游泳見長我母校中西熟之同學到此求學者往往一年之後體格益健所以體育敎授某女士笑語余曰數年畢業後回國見母親身體强壯而不認識矣師蓋以各生體育淮步自詡也</p>
<p>本校在美國爲純粹女子大學之一創辦較早學生之畢業者亦較多庽吾松之枉西女士敏以麗的自身及其姑母和姪女均畢業是校湖州孟醫生之夫人亦是校畢業生明年（一九三一年）其女公子亦預約到本校求學爾昭母校上海中西熟畢業生來此者前後十餘人大半畢業已返國服務是校有優待華人之聲譽我國女子赴美求學者似以先到本校爲宜</p>
<h3>（二）敎授態度</h3>

<p>交通部長王伯羣昨晨七時由京乘夜快車抵滬王氏爲中國航空公司董事長對於上海第二號飛機失事案擬在滬召集董事會議討論責任撫恤及善後諸問題本報記者昨日特往訪晤叩詢甚詳茲詳述　氏之談話如左</p>
<p>董事會議王氏云飛機失事案余已得有公司詳細之報告此次來滬定二十一日（即今日）下午五時在航空公司召集董事會議列席者除余外尙有韋次長以黻劉司長書藩及美董波林POIIN漢麥爾頓HAMILTON共五人會議主要範圍爲討論善後各問題届時並擬召見各關係人員詳詢當時一切情形以資研究</p>
<p>失事責任王氏又謂關於肇禍責任問題因上海號之駕駛員及機械助理員均已殞命無人作證故欲明瞭當時駕駛及飛機機械之情形殊不可能而肇禍眞正原因更無以表白按公司報告當時飛行頗低且又沿江邊起飛其何以低飛及沿江邊理由是否因當時飛機機械有損急須降落江灘或有其他原因至今均因事無佐證祇可作揣測論調不能爲實際之憑證</p>
<p>楊永泰言王氏續稱凡此種種均爲事實上之困難余今日（即昨日）曾往寳隆醫院慰問楊永泰氏楊精神頗佳余即詢以當時經過情形據謂在飛機墜落熊司令已倒在我之身上當時我頗覺難過呼吸艱難心中尙以爲飛行過高空氣稀薄之故不知已肇巨禍也云云楊爲七人中受傷最輕當時神志最清者尙莫明其妙他無論矣且進一步言中國無航空法即各國亦付闕如故肇禍責任問題祇可舍法言情關於死傷撫恤問題王氏謂殞命之二機師爲公司職員自當從優議恤至乘客之撫恤當提出董事會議再爲决定</p>
<p>滬宜航空記者詢以滬宜航空何日開航王氏答稱因上海號失事後飛機及人才兩感缺乏故航線擴展不得不稍緩大約明年一二月間可望實現滬平線尙在籌劃中至將來駕駛人才公司史當愼重考騐飛機機件亦當時加察看務使萬分穩妥此層亦當於董事會議中提出設法加以整頓云云</p>

<h3>英國的拒鼠週秋水</h3>
<p>鼠之爲害夫人知之矣染癘疫汚食物固不僅咬衣毁物已也衛生家以鼠爲人生大敵之多方設法以期撲滅然而鼠類之蕃殖極速此落彼起固無窮盡之日也英國政府每年有一度之拒鼠週届期全國民衆一致奮起羣向鼠類作激烈之搏戰冀以促起一般人之注意而使鼠類之早日得絶跡於人類法至善也</p>
<p>勢均力敵一年一度之拒鼠週今年已於十一月十日起舉行其時全國各地之藥房以及私人醫室莫不出其全力陳列各種捕鼠藥料以及捕鼠器具以供衆覽各地熱心之民衆更有糾合同志實行向鼠類開戰或組織演講隊馳赴鄉僻之區作拒鼠之宣傳者各地捕鼠專家更有以各種捕鼠方法印成小册分送各地以便採擇一時全國駁動鼠心寒戰大有不可終日之勢然而鼠性狡獪能預知禍患人類所加於彼之攻擊雖烈而其子孫固尙綿綿不絶也按英國以及衛爾司兩地有國民四千萬口據專家研究以謂鼠類之在英國爲數亦不相上下勢力旣當其搏戰之結果自亦難分軒輊矣</p>
<p>專殺雌者拒鼠之法約有二種曰生擒曰毒斃生擒者多用籠阱甜餌之類使其上鈎再加撲殺毒斃者多用各種毒藥拌入餅餌之内使其一口吞入毒發腹内不可復救最近且更有施用（毒瓦斯）以攻鼠者一度施用於室内鼠類即可一網以打盡然毒死斯能致人死施用之後人不可近投鼠忌器實非良策英國之捕鼠專家乃謂欲滅鼠類自非用（羅定）之法不可羅定之法何謂蓋亦最新發明之捕鼠方法也發明者名羅定故有斯名施用此法者僅斃雌鼠不及雄者戰綫旣較狹成功自較易雌者爲生殖之源雌鼠旣滅雄者亦自難久存一舉兩備安得不謂之善法又尙有一事須附記於此者即鼠類性善旅行爲覓食或避難能遠行至一百五十哩以外者故捕鼠之法貴乎各地同時舉行網羅密佈無隙可逃鼠類之絶種乃　幾乎有望也</p>
<h3>南洋游記（一○六）</h3>
<p>緬僧智識甚高常謂我曰吾緬將來亦難免共産之刦余詢其故答曰中國印度均有共産黨殺機蔓延緬甸居中印之間早晚必受其影響也然吾人聞之殊不謂然吾謂暹羅緬甸均佛化國將來雖同受共産之刦然其民性善良所受之禍究較少也</p>
<p>瓦城道路平直寬大頗似北平屋宇清新又似南京惟地乾多塵耳緬城有一良法可法效者其街道布置多用數目爲名瓦城街名縱横多以一至一百之數目仰光中國街亦然而非中國街則不用此名之余謂用數目名街爲甚宜之法中國古代周禮所稱匠人　國之法首在分經緯今可考者如曲阜之城雖小而南北東西經緯井井山東新租界亦以經緯路名其街甚便尋查今各地市街名雜亂無章方向無準甚矣豈如我古制哉</p>
<p>十五日由解敦明之介紹訪緬人RYAWHLAO渠亦爲瓦城證道會之書記閱余英文函甚好又仿緬人戈八瓦城　石業頗發達但實石之業甚難言語其長可立富語其短亦可致貧但終是致富者多余見上灰色石塊問之動云值數萬大致緣翡翠石以潤澤爲佳石之至貴者十倍於黃金之價但聞近年出産亦不佳中國進口又增稅一般玉石商亦呌苦云不過中國商人製造玉石器之法將須將石塊運到上海做成種種器皿再售與歐人在滬者我怪何以不由此直售歐洲而多進口稅出口稅及經白人手之週折大抵華人只曉得滬市行情而乏歐美市塲智識又因此地工人笨拙須到滬工塲做成因滬工靈巧也但我以爲不如移工於此應省一番費用耳</p>
<h3>歲寒憶杭州三友黃廬</h3>
<p>松竹梅别來無恙否</p>
<p>天寒霜種歲聿暮矣歎韶光之如馳感馬齒之徒增勞人草草年來常爲衣食所驅奔馳南北身等萍浮邇者復辭去杭州報職重來海上雖　身商界顧猶未能脫文字生涯也當此嚴霜時節　憶杭垣三友不勝魂夢繫之三友者宋氏墓道之松韜光之竹與夫孤山之梅是也傭窗多暇爰筆而記之三君有知其或笑我痴懚否耶</p>
<p>宋氏墓道在靈隱之背占地可數十畝中有也階凡百餘層兩旁遍植疏松或虬麟而蒼老孤可棲鶴或青翠而秀雅高與雲齊臨斯地也靜聽風送松聲與澗坡之泉聲相應和如千頃之波濤如萬馬之奔騰旣壯且偉亦雅亦幽愚游蹤至此曾流連久之歎曰生能於此處構廬死得於斯地築一邱則畢生無憾矣然此願終成夢想耳</p>
<p>由靈隱至鞱光高可千仭凡數百級兩旁叢林皆翠竹也修者可數丈低者亦丈餘粗者如桶瘦者如臂由山麓抵山巓綜其數當以萬計不可謂非偉觀也或傳製造天竺　之竹即採於是實則非也凡游杭者多好刻其姓名於竹幹以留紀念昔人詩云（千竿萬竿竹一枝兩枝梅）蓋竹以叢勝梅以疏宜觀乎韜光竹徑之幽益可信已</p>
<p>孤山之梅留傳數百載聞名遍全國實則疏疏淡淡未足以云大觀蓋杭州多名梅論奇古當推超山之唐梅宋梅論幽緻當推靈峯之紅梅綠萼孤山之梅或賴林公才名爲傳耳雖然梅花高士也宣生長幽谷不與世近乃能顯其孤潔孤山之梅旣無園叟漑護復遭俗子摧殘欲其不與其他草木同朽者安可得乎</p>

<h3>World Natural Disasters</h3>
<p>Since recent years, the man-made disasters in the world have been greater than in the past, and so-called natural disasters have also been heard from time to time. For example, the extraordinary cold recorded the other day, the storm and heavy rain on the Black Sea recorded today, and the news that most of the United States will be hit by a terrible storm, and the eruption of a large volcano in central Java. Such things are heard almost every day. Ancient people believed that these were due to the interaction between heaven and man, and that natural disasters would only occur when people's hearts were depraved. This was a warning from the ancients to make people examine themselves and improve, but it is not necessarily the truth.</p>
<p>I believe that there is a natural connection between heaven and man. When people are in turmoil, it is not necessarily that everyone's heart is evil, but that the Earth's movement happens to be in a certain state, and the Earth senses it and has all kinds of restless phenomena. Mankind senses it and has all kinds of unequal and resentful behaviors. Therefore, in times of turmoil, natural disasters are also numerous. This is due to nature and not deliberately caused. On the contrary, in times of peace, people's hearts are harmonious and peaceful, and the movement of the celestial bodies also returns to order. This is not superstitious talk. If science can advance in the future, we will surely know the reason for this, and perhaps find ways to change it. Because I have seen the prevalence of natural disasters in recent years, which is very different from the past, I have come to these conjectures.</p>

The general idea is to use the financial resources of Jin Sui to support the excessive number of troops. A reorganization committee will be formed to eliminate the weak and retain the strong. If the Northwest Army is incorporated into Jin Sui, it is feared that the financial resources of the two provinces will not be able to bear it, and the demobilization expenses are also an important issue. Liu Guitang's army is currently stationed in Puyang, and representatives have come to Tianjin. Zhang allows the downsizing of one brigade.

After the ceremony, Hu Hanmin delivered an opening speech, saying that although the work of the Legislative Yuan in the past two years has been well received by public opinion at home and abroad, we must not be complacent. There is even more work to be done than before, and we should work harder. In addition to formulating laws, we also have the power to supervise politics. In the past, due to military reasons, we sometimes had to understand and excuse politics. Now that the military affairs have come to an end, we can no longer shirk our responsibilities. For example, if the Supervisory Yuan is established but cannot fulfill its duties, we can also question it. There are only four years left in the period of political tutelage. All laws and regulations that have not been formulated, or have been formulated in the main law but not in the implementation law, or have not been formulated in the main law but should be formulated separately, we should complete them one by one within two years. In the past, all comrades cherished time very much, and in the future, we should cherish it even more, so that China can move from rule by man to complete rule of law, seeking the happiness of the people on the one hand, and giving the people legal training on the other. Then, Central representative Wang Chonghui and National Government representative Dai Chuanxian successively gave speeches. Then, they drew lots for seating arrangements and dispersed. At 6:00 PM, Hu Hanmin hosted a banquet at the Yuan to welcome all the members.</p>

Up to the end of last month, 7 locomotives and 59 passenger and freight cars had been recovered successively. In fact, 21 locomotives and 318 passenger and freight cars are still detained. These vehicles are all parked in the Shunde and Jiaozuo areas and are operated by the Transportation Headquarters, and there is no news of their return. Since the military rise, all the roads have been on the verge of bankruptcy. Now that the military affairs have ended, the troops on all the roads have also returned the vehicles they detained separately. Please consider the precarious situation of the roads and order Shi's army to return the detained locomotives and vehicles to the original roads as soon as possible to facilitate transportation and maintain commercial operations.

In the afternoon at 2:00 PM, all the staff of the Jinpu Tianjin Office hosted a banquet for Sun. At 4:00 PM, Sun went to the Xingyuan to visit Zhang. According to Sun, this trip is to ask the Northeast to return the vehicles. According to the statistics of the vehicles that passed the track, there are 1,340 freight cars, 153 passenger cars, and 42 locomotives in the Northeast. Shi Yousan detained 21 locomotives, 44 passenger cars, and 274 freight cars. The remaining armies detained 29 locomotives, 40 passenger cars, and 302 freight cars. At present, there are only more than 50 locomotives on this road, many of which cannot be used, 170 passenger cars, and 997 freight cars, and half of them cannot be used. If you want to repair it, there is no money. On the evening of the 19th, I met Gao Jiyi, Director of the Northeast Communications Committee. He said that many Jinpu cars are being returned one after another. Many of the Northeast Army's troop transports into the customs were detained by other roads. In fact, the number stored in the Northeast is limited. After asking the Vice Commander for instructions, he can consider returning them. As for Shi's army detaining the cars, Zhang has been ordered to order Shi to return them. Jiang ordered the various armies to return the cars within a time limit, but they all have excuses not to return them. The Railway Department sent personnel to investigate the vehicles and departed on the 18th, but it is feared that it will be difficult to assess them because when the A-road car is transported to the B-road, the car name and number will be changed. During Zhang Zongchang's time, this road borrowed money from Pingan Bank.</p>
<p>Because there are no underlying volumes to check, it is scheduled to go to Peiping on the 21st to investigate the number. This road does not owe foreign debts. If all the vehicles are recovered, there will be no war for three years, and the remaining profits can be used to build a railway equal to Jinpu. (20th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Governor-General of India to Be Replaced</h3>
<p>With Governor-General of Canada Willingdon to Succeed</p>
<p>Gandhi's Son Released from Prison Only to Be Rearrested</p>
<p>Round Table Conference May Conclude Next Month</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th - Viscount Willingdon, the Governor-General of Canada, will be appointed as the Governor-General of India. Willingdon was born in 1866 and has served as the Governor of both Bombay and Madras provinces for over a decade. In 1924, he attended the League of Nations Council as a representative of India. In 1926, he served on the Boxer Indemnity Committee and presided over a tour of China. Ten years ago, there were calls for him to be promoted to Governor-General of India, but this did not materialize. It is customary for former governors of Indian provinces not to be appointed as Governor-General of India. Therefore, the news of this appointment has been viewed as unusual. However, there is a consensus that he is a capable person. Willingdon was a member of the House of Commons twenty years ago and belonged to the Liberal Party. However, successive Conservative, Liberal, and Labour governments have valued him. Therefore, this appointment is unlikely to cause partisan disputes. Most newspapers have no objections. Some say that India has gained a sincere and understanding friend, which is a cause for celebration for India. Others say that the government has selected a worthy talent, which is a cause for celebration for the government. Still others praise Viscount Willingdon for taking on an extremely difficult job in his old age, not shrinking from difficulties, and being full of a spirit of dedication. At the same time, the Indian representatives attending the Round Table Conference also said that Viscount Willingdon is extremely suitable to govern India and is welcomed by India.</p>
<p>Reuters, Surat, 19th - Gandhi's son, Ramdas, was imprisoned for six months and recently released. On December 1, he spoke in Maitod about non-violent resistance, which led to his rearrest. It is said that the Maitod area is now producing its own private salt.</p>

<p>Trade Union Bill Inevitably Causes Controversy</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th - In the House of Commons today, Labour MPs Ganweixi and others asked about diplomatic matters. The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Dayton, replied that the word "enemy" in the draft agreement prepared by the Geneva Disarmament Preparatory Committee has been finalized, and the disarmament treaty can be published. Outsiders believe that this draft agreement is completely useless, but if public opinion is correct, the existing draft agreement can actually help achieve complete disarmament throughout the world.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th - Home Secretary Cline has submitted the People's Participation Bill in the House of Commons, containing the government's proposals for electoral reform and voting choices. The House of Commons has adjourned until January 20.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th - After the Christmas holiday, the opposition party in the House of Commons will engage in fierce struggles over the government's recently proposed Industrial Disputes and Trade Union Bill. The Conservative Party claims that it will refute it sentence by sentence. Even many members of the Liberal Party are unwilling to swallow some unpalatable clauses in the Trade Union Bill in exchange for the benefits of electoral reform. The bill is currently being meticulously studied by a committee of legal experts from the Conservative and Liberal parties to point out various doubts. The Liberal Party's committee will submit a report on January 20, at which time the Liberal Party will decide whether to completely reject it, or support the second reading and propose amendments during the review. What the Liberal Party opposes most is the clause that trade unions can collect political fees from members, and those who are unwilling to pay will be expelled from the union. However, it is expected that the government will adopt a cautious approach and submit the bill to a standing committee in order to both prolong the legislative procedure and increase the government's security. This is because even if the standing committee disagrees with the various clauses, the government does not need to resign.</p>

According to the Cuban Meteorological Observatory, a hurricane will sweep across the east coast of the United States and Washington in 24 hours. The U.S. National Weather Service also said that a severe storm will affect the coast. According to the prediction of climate experts, the direction of the storm will be through Georgia or South Carolina to Tennessee, and then turn north to Florida, which may be spared this time. It is said that the storm may weaken after it makes landfall, so as not to cause a major disaster.</p>

<h3>No Reduction in U.S. Agricultural Harvests Expected</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 19th - According to a report released today by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there is no expectation of a reduction in U.S. agricultural harvests in the short term. The total area planted this winter is 42,042,000 acres, only 2% less than last winter. The planting area for oats this winter is 4,150,000 acres, an increase compared to last year. Therefore, according to the technicians and experts of the department, the reduction of agricultural production may have to wait for another day.</p>

<h3>Recent Bandit Suppression Situation in Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>Various Regions Report Success in Defeating Scattered Bandits</p>
<p>The Han and Hao Divisions Have Arrived in Jiangxi One After Another</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence - The Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Ninth Route Army, Lu Dipin, recently returned to Ji'an to command the various units to suppress the bandits. There has been some progress recently. The following is a summary of the recent bandit suppression situation:</p>
<p>The Gong Division Defeats Huang Gonglue's Gang - Yang Sizhong, the commander of the 20th Regiment of the Gong Chengfan Division, engaged in a fierce battle with the communist bandit Huang Gonglue and others, totaling over 7,000 people (approximately 2,000 guns), near Xianleshans on the 9th of this month. The bandit gang was defeated and fled towards Taihe. Over 300 bandits were killed and over 58 were captured alive. Over 19 rifles, knives, spears, and flags were seized. On the afternoon of the same day, they occupied Fenghuangxu and divided their troops to garrison Yonghe and search for scattered bandits. Most of them are still tracking and suppressing the bandits.</p>
<p>The Tan Bandit Suppression Clears Out the Remaining Bandits in Le'an - The 50th Division's office in the province received a letter from a certain officer of the division from the front line yesterday, stating that after our division recovered Le'an and Yihuang on the 11th of last month, it was ordered to concentrate all forces in Le'an. The division commander ordered the Yue Brigade to the right to Piaoxi Niutianjie to connect with the Zhang Division. The Luo Brigade went south to Zengtianjie, and the Cheng Brigade went left to Taipingxu to connect with the Xuanhuang Eighth Division. In addition to strict defense, we also sent teams to search for bandits and had daily gains. We also persuaded the coerced masses to organize guard teams to transform farmer bandits into good citizens. Unless we first remove their eyes and ears and disperse their accomplices, it will be difficult to suppress the bandits. The vicinity of Le'an will gradually be cleared. In the future, we will unite with various friendly forces to gradually advance and strictly encircle and suppress the bandits. No matter how cunning the bandits such as Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang are, they will eventually be caught in our inescapable net.</p>
<p>The Ma Brigade Defeats the Bandits Who Fled from Ganzhou - The 12th Division Office in the province received a telegram from the Ma Brigade Commander of the division yesterday, stating that after the bandits who had been defeated in the siege, Jia Ri sent a battalion of the 67th Regiment to Tankou and two battalions of the 68th Regiment to Wangfu to pursue them. Reports were received that the bandit traces were found at 6:00 PM on the 6th. They were given a severe blow. The bandits resisted slightly and retreated. The bandits in Wangfu retreated to Xinfeng, and the bandits in Tankou retreated to Wangfu, hoping to meet with the bandit team there. However, they encountered our two battalions who intercepted them head-on. They were extremely embarrassed, and some of them retreated to Longyan's lair. In this battle, over 200 bandits were killed, dozens were captured, and over 20 rifles were seized. We are still searching for bandits.</p>
<p>The Luo Division Engages in Fierce Battle with Bandits in Gujiang - On the 8th, the 458th Regiment of the 77th Luo Division engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits in Gujiang. The bandits could not withstand the pressure and collapsed in panic towards Dayuan Shaxi. We immediately recovered Gujiang. On the same day, the bandits who were defeated by our side had approximately 600 to 700 guns and a large number of people. The next morning, the bandits launched a counterattack on our side from different routes. A large number of the Ganxi Red Guards and the Third Army of the Red Army crossed the river from the south bank to assist in the attack, totaling over 10,000 people. Our side was in high spirits and shot bravely. The bandits eventually collapsed and retreated to Dayuan. It is estimated that over 300 bandits were killed and the bandit leader Zhong Baofu was captured alive. Several rifles and many other items were seized. We are still searching for bandits.</p>
<p>The Liu Brigade Captures Bandit Leader in Yongxin - Commander-in-Chief Lu received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Jiang of the 19th Route Army, stating (1) that our headquarters and the Cai Division have arrived in Yongxin, and the Dai Division has passed through Lianhua. Tomorrow, the Cai Division will advance towards Wan'an, and the Xun Division will advance towards Taihe. (2) When the vanguard unit of the Cai Division, the Liu Brigade, arrived in Yongxin on the 7th, over 1,000 bandits attempted to resist. Our vanguard gave them a severe blow, killing many bandits. The bandits fled in panic towards Anfu. We captured the fake company commander Wu Yuan, the Red Guard Captain Chen Xiu, the Soviet government member Yin Kewen, the Minister of Culture Zhou Wenshan, and many Red Army officers and soldiers.</p>
<p>The Bandits in Wuning Suffered Repeated Heavy Losses - The Provincial Security Office received a telegram from the Wuning garrison Wu Regiment Commander, stating that after the first battalion of our regiment suffered a loss due to the disparity in numbers on the sun day in Lixi, they retreated to the garrison and worked with County Magistrate Liu to arrange city defenses and resist with all their might. The bandit gang charged the city more than a dozen times, but were unsuccessful. On the geng day, the attack on the city was even fiercer. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers fought bravely and seized over 70 ladders, wounding over 200 bandits. Five officers were injured and one died. On the jia day, the bandits retreated to the northwest due to excessive injuries. A few came to attack the east gate, and then launched a fierce attack on the northwest gate. Our department resisted with all its might, seizing over 13 ladders and killing many bandits. By the gray morning, they had completely collapsed towards Xiushui. The fake regimental commander was injured in the head, the fake Li company commander was injured in the left arm, and one fake platoon leader died and two were injured. Dozens were also killed by aircraft bombing. In this battle, the bandits suffered over 400 casualties.</p>
<p>The Han and Hao Divisions Arrive in Jiangxi to Assist in the Suppression - In order to thoroughly eliminate the communist bandits, Commander-in-Chief Jiang specially dispatched a large army to Jiangxi to assist in the suppression. He ordered a brigade of the 52nd Division of Han Deqin to depart from Pukou to Jiangxi. Later, he ordered a temporary suspension of the departure of the brigade and instead dispatched the Hao Division of the 54th Division to Jiangxi. The following is Commander-in-Chief Jiang's telegram to Commander-in-Chief Lu: (To Commander-in-Chief Lu Yong'an Xiongjian: The brigade of the 52nd Division has been temporarily suspended from departing and the 54th Division has been dispatched from Wuhan to Jiujiang for concentration, pending further orders. Special telegram to inform you, Jiang Zhongzheng Wenwu Can Yin Yi.) Yesterday, Commander-in-Chief Lu also received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Jiang, informing that the 155th Brigade of Sun Changjun of the 52nd Division had arrived in Jiujiang and had been ordered to go to the designated location for garrisoning and was under the nearby command of Commander-in-Chief Lu. It is known that Sun's Brigade arrived at Niuhang Station by car from Xun on the evening of the 15th and crossed the river this morning (16th) to temporarily garrison in Nanchang pending further orders. The Hao Mengling Department of the 54th Division has already departed from Wuhan, and the vanguard troops have been transported to Xun. One regiment has already transferred to the province by car yesterday. The remaining troops will arrive one after another within days. Division Commander Hao himself went to Guling yesterday to pay his respects to Commander-in-Chief Jiang, report on the troop movements, and request instructions on the bandit suppression plan. He will come to Nanchang within days. (December 16)</p>
<h3>Report on the Administration of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission</h3>
<p>The Experiences of Councilor Ba's Mission to Nepal</p>
<p>Today (the 20th), Councilor Chu Mingshan of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission delivered a report on the administration at the Central Broadcasting Station. The content is as follows: (The recent work of this commission has focused on the organization of Mongolian and Tibetan inspection teams and the preparation of the Tibet conference. The results will be reported in detail at that time. This report focuses on the details and results of Councilor Ba's mission to Nepal.)</p>
<p>(1) Reasons for Going to Nepal: Nepal was originally a vassal state of China. After conquering it during the Qianlong reign, a treaty of offering the correct calendar and paying tribute was established. China also enfeoffed its prime minister as the Commander-in-Chief and the Guoguo King. Since then, tributes have been paid in every dynasty without interruption. Even in the early years of the Republic of China, Nepalese tribute envoys came once. However, due to the discord between China and Tibet at that time, they were blocked and could not pass, resulting in the severance of relations with China. It is truly regrettable that a vassal state for more than 150 years was suddenly cut off. Now that China's foundation has been laid and construction is in full swing, we cannot talk about distant strategies for the time being, but we should have some contact with our own vassals and allied countries to restore the old order. Furthermore, this spring, Nepalese merchants were killed by Tibetans, causing a conflict between Nepal and Tibet. The Dalai Lama was no match and requested assistance from China. One of these places is Chinese territory, and the other is a vassal state of China. Of course, China must come out to stop and mediate. This is the attitude that a suzerain state should maintain, and it is the reason why Councilor Ba was sent to that country.</p>
<p>(2) Situation in Nepal: Councilor Ba departed from Beijing on May 30th this year and arrived in Calcutta, India, on July 19th. In India, he disguised himself as a merchant to avoid the attention of the British. After much trouble, he secretly entered Nepal. After arriving in Nepal, he met with the Foreign Minister in the name of a merchant. After some greetings, he presented the letter of credence. The minister's expression changed drastically and became very serious. Besides thanking China for its kindness, he had no other words. The Nepalese have always respected China as a superior nation, and the presence of an envoy made him feel extremely honored. The minister immediately reported to Prime Minister Bhim Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana, who sent someone to receive and arrange the audience. When the time came, a four-wheeled carriage was sent from the palace to welcome him, with escorts shouting along the way, which was extremely grand. After the ceremony, Councilor Ba conveyed his intentions. The Nepalese Prime Minister felt extremely honored and expressed his gratitude, saying that Nepal was a small country like a bullet, and that the great China sent an envoy to comfort them, which not only made them feel honored but also deeply ashamed. After leaving the palace, he was welcomed to the government guesthouse, where everything was provided by the palace, including wine, food, pigs, sheep, incense, and flowers. The treatment was extremely generous, and he was invited to participate in their military parade and the Buffalo Sacrifice Festival. He stayed in Nepal for 45 days and left Nepal on October 14th. On the day of his departure, the Prime Minister said that he should have sent officials to pay tribute to the superior country, but Buddhism does not allow crossing the sea, and the road to Tibet is blocked. He had no choice but to entrust the envoy with dozens of gifts, including tiger skins, precious swords, rhinoceros horns, golden Buddhas, bronze lions, ivory boxes, and gold satin portraits, as well as two letters of credence, and asked the envoy to present them. He hoped that after the road between China and Tibet was opened, he would come to China again. Before leaving, he sent dozens of people to escort him out of the country and delivered the gifts to Calcutta. He boarded a ship on October 14th and arrived in Beijing on November 30th. He presented the gifts and letters of credence to the National Government for inspection. The trip took six months, and the result of the mission to the vassal state was quite good. This is the detailed account of Councilor Ba's trip to Nepal.</p>
<p>(3) Observations in Nepal: Nepal is located on the sunny side of the Himalayas, surrounded by mountains, with a very dangerous terrain. It is 500 miles long from east to west and over 100 miles wide from north to south. The land is fertile, the products are abundant, the climate is refreshing, and the population is about 5.5 million, mostly Nepalese and Gurkhas. The Nepalese resemble Tibetans, while the Gurkhas are of Indian origin. They are extremely fierce, wear belts and swords, and are courageous in public battles, possessing the spirit of Japanese bushido. Although Nepal has a monarch, he is actually a figurehead. Military and political power are entirely in the hands of the Prime Minister, who is succeeded by brothers, uncles, and nephews, which is more advanced than the father-to-son succession system in the Chinese monarchical era. The country has a standing army of about 40,000 men, and in wartime, the entire country is mobilized. The elite troops of the British who control India are recruited from Gurkha soldiers, about 300,000 men. The British provide Nepal with 1 million rupees annually and are very polite, precisely for this reason. Nepal regards Tibet as a vassal, treats Britain as a good friend, and still sees China as a superior nation. For the sake of protecting Tibet and supporting small and weak nations in India, it is necessary to connect with Nepal. We hope that the government and those who are concerned about the border will pay attention to this.)</p>
<h3>Zhu and Mao Abandon Changting and Head for Yongding</h3>
<p>The Date for a Large-Scale Bandit Suppression is Not Far Off</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Last month, on the 22nd, Zhu and Mao's communist bandits fled from the Jiangxi border to Tingzhou. Local communist elements in western Fujian, such as Zhang Dingchen, Deng Yigang, Deng Yi, Hu Shaomei, and Deng Zihui, rose up in response. The Fujian army defending the city, Huang Yuebo's brigade, withdrew to Liancheng. Zhu and Mao then occupied Changting on the 22nd and extorted 50,000 yuan from the Tingzhou Chamber of Commerce. Most of the major businesses fled, and only 20,000 yuan was extorted. Zhu and Mao's bandit troops also sent out propaganda teams to extort money from various villages. It is impossible to count the number of those who were extorted for 1,000 yuan or several hundred yuan. The houses of the Lu and Li families were burned down because the extortions were not successful. Within fifty li of the city, nine out of ten houses were empty. Many refugees fled into the mountains and lived in caves, not daring to cook during the day. On the 29th, the bandits, seeing that only an empty shell remained in the city and there was nothing more to extort, divided their troops and harassed Shanghang, Yongding, Liancheng, Ninghua, and other places. Huang Yuebo's brigade then led troops to re-enter Tingzhou on the 2nd. Refugees also moved back from their caves. The scene of displacement and loss was unbearable to witness. On the 8th, Zhu and Mao's main force fled from Changting to Jinfeng and Kuzhu in Yongding County. Their headquarters were established in Hulei Kan City. On the 9th, they moved towards the Guangdong border to Xiayang, Zhongkeng, and Wuping. Zhong Shaokui's armed self-defense corps of Yongding concentrated on the Guangdong border at Tiandejia, holding firm and awaiting reinforcements. Chen Rongguang's water police corps from Fengshi specially dispatched Chen Ziqiang and Lin Lixu to Chao and Shantou to request troops and ammunition from Xiang Hanping, commander of the 62nd Division. Since Commander Xiang had gone to the provincial capital and had not returned, Chief of Staff Ye Houyu received them. Ye agreed to allocate 10,000 rounds of ammunition to assist Chen and ordered Huang Chaochong's battalion stationed in Dapu to move to the Fujian border to assist the local defense corps in blocking the bandits. Currently, Xiang's Li Zhenliang regiment is stationed in Xingning Luogang to defend the Jiangxi border, and Chen Ju's regiment is stationed in Jiaoling to defend the Fujian border. Zhang Zhen's division completed its departure from Zhangzhou on the 10th and is advancing towards Longyan and Yongding. Once the Central Army from Jiangxi Province arrives in Changting, it will encircle and attack Shanghang and Liancheng. The date for a large-scale bandit suppression should not be far off.

<h3>Abducted German Missionaries in Meixian Have Been Rescued</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Two years ago, German missionaries Wan Jinghe and He San, were abducted by Gu Dacun's communist bandits while summering at the highest peak of Qingliang Mountain, on the border of Meixian and Fengshun counties. The bandits demanded a huge ransom, and the church could not afford the enormous sum. The three missionaries also wrote to the church, asking them not to pay the ransom, but to pray more. They vowed to dedicate their lives to spreading the gospel and practicing medicine in China, believing that their abduction was divinely ordained and that they would be released. Later, the missionaries practiced medicine and did good deeds among the bandits, and this spring they were released unconditionally. This year, Commander Xiang has been extremely diligent in suppressing local communists in Fengshun County, destroying the bandit nests in the Eight Villages Mountains and Jiulongzhang. The remaining bandits have been nearly wiped out. Today, a telegram was received from Kong Kequan's regiment stationed in Fengshun, stating that Chen Kuiya and his wife, standing committee members of the East River Farmers' and Workers' Soldiers' Representative Council of the Communist Party, and over a hundred Red Guards were hiding in Shangyang, Qilangdangshi, and Jiulongzhang. The regiment dispatched the companies of Fu Changguang, Tan Yin, and Yang Guishan to search the bandit nests in Yingge Deli, Yangqian Pit, Shangyang, Qilangdangshi, and Gouwei Ji. In this operation, 13 bandits were killed, and the office of the Red Army Guard Corps was destroyed, seizing rifles, carbines, red flags, propaganda materials, etc. Chen Kuiya escaped. Furthermore, on the evening of the 10th, He Naiying, the Magistrate of Fengshun County, personally led a bandit suppression team to the Shijiaotang Stone Cave in Dashen Township and rescued the German missionaries He Yungong and Wan Baoquan, who had been abducted by bandits two years ago. They were sent back to the county office on the 11th. Although the two missionaries are old, they are fortunately healthy as ever. However, having lived in the mountains for a long time, they appear slightly pale and emaciated with shaggy beards and hair. They were sent back to Meixian during the day. (December 15th)</p>
<h3>The Truth Behind the Situation on the Kang Border</h3>
<p>War Between Daji Temple in Xikang and Bairi Tusi</p>
<p>Xikang Correspondence: The war between Daji Lamasery in Ganzi County, Xikang North Road, and Bairi Tusi over the reincarnation of the Living Buddha and inheritance issues has been going on for several months. Because both sides have backgrounds, the local war is gradually affecting the overall situation in Kang and Tibet. Although the Central Government has ordered a halt to the offensive, the war has not yet ended. The general situation of Daji Temple, its relationship with Tibet, and the process of the current war are described below for those who are concerned about border affairs.</p>
<p>Overview of Daji Temple: According to records, Daji Lamasery was initially only a third-class temple with only several hundred lamas. Since the end of the Qing Dynasty, there have been many border incidents and endless wars between Sichuan and Tibet. When the Sichuan army won, they advanced westward, and when the Tibetan army won, they invaded eastward. In this back-and-forth, the people of Kang were already unable to bear it, especially the wealthy lamasery. Regardless of whether the Han or Tibetan troops arrived, they would accuse them of colluding with the enemy, looting, and burning them at will. Therefore, the top first- and second-class temples have declined. Only Daji Temple in this area has been able to survive unscathed due to its ability to deal with the situation. More and more monks from all directions have returned to it. Moreover, because Ganzi is a wealthy area, the lamas of the temple use temple property to engage in business, and their capital has been increasing day by day, making them one of the wealthiest in the area, which has long been coveted by others. In the fifth year of the Republic of China, the people of Xiangcheng in Xikang South Road, coveting its wealth, gathered a cavalry of 1,000 men to besiege it for three days and nights, but were eventually repelled. Since then, the temple has expanded its military force to defend against foreign aggression. It is estimated that the temple has over 1,800 lamas, over 2,000 quick-firing rifles, and over 2,000 good horses. Outsiders are not allowed to enter the temple on weekdays, and the Ganzi magistrate can only deal with it perfunctorily.</p>
<p>Relationship with Tibet: Ganzi County is under the jurisdiction of the Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan-Kang Border. More than a hundred li to the west is the garrison of the Tibetan army (note that the Tibetan army advanced to Ganzi after invading eastward in the sixth year of the Republic of China). The Dalai Lama, seeing the wealth and military strength of Daji Temple, and its location in the throat of Xikang North Road, deeply desired to use it as a base for eastward invasion. Therefore, he spared no effort to win it over and supplied it with money and guns. In the twelfth year of the Republic of China, when Chen Xialing, the Garrison Commander of the Sichuan Border, was defeated, Daji Temple disarmed the few Sichuan troops stationed in Ganzi, which was the result of the Dalai Lama's instigation. From then on, the Dalai Lama's desire to use Daji Temple became even more urgent, and he often sent special personnel to give gifts and rewards to the lamas. Moreover, all lamas from the temple who went to Tibet were treated favorably. Having received such special treatment, the temple naturally prostrated itself before the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p>The Process of the War: This war was caused by a conflict between Daji Temple and the local Bairi Tusi over the enthronement of a Living Buddha and inheritance issues (note that Bairi Tusi is one of the major Tusi in the North Road, and although Zhao Erfeng of the Qing Dynasty changed the system of Tusi and returned the land to the government, the local people still mostly believe in him). Initially, neighboring Tusi Baozheng mediated, and then the Ganzi County Magistrate came out to persuade them, but to no avail. Daji Temple relied on its strong manpower and horses to flaunt its power. Bairi Tusi was unwilling to show weakness and gathered his subordinates and monks to resist with all their strength. In mid-August of this year, the sentries of both sides clashed, followed by a formal declaration of war. Daji Temple sent its cavalry to attack and loot Bairi villages and occupy the houses. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, Bairi requested assistance from the standing army in Xikang (i.e., Liu Wenhui's subordinates). The standing army had been stationed in a remote area for a long time, living in hardship, and had long coveted the wealth of Daji Temple. Hearing this news, they gladly agreed to provide assistance. However, they were worried that the lamas of Daji Temple were numerous and had sufficient guns, and that they had a long-standing relationship with Tibet. If they lost the battle, they would lose the prestige of the authorities. If they won the battle, they were afraid that the Tibetan side would use the excuse of protecting the temple to intervene. Therefore, they took precautions and first notified the Tibetan army stationed nearby with an official document, explaining the illegal activities of Daji Temple and planning to send troops to suppress them, requesting that they not misunderstand. The Tibetan army replied that the matter was within the jurisdiction of their army and that they would not misunderstand, but requested that they handle it cautiously. Therefore, Ma, the brigade commander of the 24th Army stationed in Da Jianlu, dispatched several companies of troops and brought cannons to join the original garrison in Ganzi to attack Daji Temple. Unexpectedly, the lamas of the temple were well-trained and did not show weakness when they saw the government troops. They counterattacked several times without losing ground. Moreover, the Tibetan army stationed in Dege supplied ammunition, and their momentum became even stronger. The government troops then increased their reinforcements and launched a large-scale encirclement in order to annihilate Daji Temple. Daji Temple had no choice but to retreat and defend the temple fortress, and asked the Dalai Lama for assistance. In order to protect its base for eastward invasion, the Dalai Lama telegraphed the Central Government, requesting that Liu Wenhui stop the troops stationed in Kang from attacking. However, the army had been besieging for several months, but Daji Temple's fortress was strong and there was no result. If they withdrew their troops, they would not only fail to recover their losses, but also lose face. Therefore, even though they had received orders from the Central Government, they still continued to send troops and generals in the hope of winning. However, the inner and outer walls of Daji Temple were about one zhang wide and two zhang high. The temple had enough grain stored to last for three years. With deep trenches and high walls, they were waiting for the enemy in a relaxed manner. It is still doubtful whether the government troops will be able to win. Moreover, the Tibetan army is close at hand, so they are not in a hurry to provide assistance. On the one hand, they want to use the Central Government's order to stop the attack. On the other hand, it is because Daji Temple has the strength to resist. If the government troops continue to reinforce, then the Tibetan side will definitely send troops to help. In that case, the overall situation in Kang and Tibet will turn into a vortex of war, and the national defense in the western border will become increasingly uncontrollable. Moreover, the merchants in the counties of the North Road are not moving forward due to the impact of the war, and business is extremely depressed. The tax revenue in Kangding has also been greatly reduced. Both Han and Tibetan merchants are complaining. It is hoped that the Central Government will issue another strict order to stop military action and seek a proper solution as soon as possible. (November 15th)</p>

<p>The First District Office Handles Land Clearance: The First District Office was ordered to handle land clearance. The district chief concurrently serves as the director of land clearance and has been issued forms and other documents and is eager to start implementation. At the 16th district affairs meeting on the 20th, it was decided to investigate the population. The district office will distribute various population investigation forms to the heads of villages and towns and start the investigation immediately, with a deadline of one month for completion. All compilation and investigation fees, in addition to the one cent per household stipulated by the county government, will be supplemented with an additional two cents per household for writing and ordering house numbers. The house numbers in the entire district will be compiled separately by the village and town heads as units, numbered from east to west. The house numbers will be made of lead sheet and will be provided and distributed by the district office. During the investigation, the district will instruct the village and town police and notify the sub-stations to send police to assist.</p>
<p>Recent News on the Construction of the Seawall Project: The Jinshanwei seawall along the coast of Punan in this county has been collapsing repeatedly and is very dangerous. In March of this year, the provincial government decided to start construction using new methods and building with cement. Commissioner Sun Kaiyi was appointed to supervise the project. The project cost is estimated at 75,000 yuan and is contracted by the Shanghai Xinyutai Construction Factory. It is reported that it will be completed by March next year.</p>

<p>Student Unrest at Qiandun Central Elementary School: Since Sun Yongchun took over as principal of Qiandun Central Elementary School this semester, he has been enthusiastic in his work. However, some of the teachers he hired, such as Zheng, Lu, and Tang, are of low academic attainment and young and impetuous. If students ask questions or stammer in their answers, they will be severely punished. Therefore, whenever Zheng teaches, the students are unwilling to listen. The most bizarre punishment is that boarding students who violate school rules will have their lunch or dinner stopped. Therefore, students often cry with empty stomachs, which has aroused the indignation of various families, who have jointly requested the Education Bureau to replace the bad teachers. However, Zheng and others not only did not repent, but intensified their actions, taking their anger out on the students, and beating and scolding them without asking for the reason in order to vent their anger. The parents, unable to bear their children being humiliated for no reason, had no choice but to order their children to temporarily suspend their studies.</p>
<p>After learning about this, the Education Bureau immediately sent county inspector Xu Shaolie and Education Committee member Zhou Qichao to Qiandun to investigate the truth. The parents and students confessed everything and requested the education authorities to immediately replace Zheng and others. Xu and Zhou saw that the facts were clear and promised to report the real situation to the director of the bureau, hoping that the education authorities would have a good solution.</p>

<p>Zhao Yihe Rice Shop Closes Due to Debt: Zhao Yihe Rice Shop on Xumen Zao City Street has been open for more than 60 years and suddenly declared bankruptcy yesterday (20th). The manager, Zhao Fuchu (Mianyun), who is also the owner, has fled. The total amount of debt owed to the assistant manager, Wu Heling, is about 130,000 yuan, including 10,000 yuan owed to Shenyuzhuang and 30,000 to 40,000 yuan owed to Xiefengsheng, Dayi, and Dayikang. The remaining 80,000 to 90,000 yuan is owed to small depositors. It is reported that the reason for the bankruptcy is that business has been sluggish for many years and there were losses of more than 10,000 yuan in wheat this year. Zhao himself lost 20,000 yuan in Shanghai by speculating in gold. Moreover, the store was originally managed by his father, Zhao Shucheng. After Shucheng passed away eight years ago, Fuchu was addicted to writing and contributing to newspapers in Shanghai and was not good at managing the business. Over the years, there have been losses to partners and customers, and the accumulated losses have been too great, resulting in financial difficulties. Zhao Qian Dadaou Hang (managed by Shi Weichun and assisted by Pan Jianting), an affiliated store of the store in Darihui Bridge, was also asked by depositors to withdraw their goods as collateral yesterday. In addition, there is a branch of Zhao Yihe in Pingwang, but the business is not large enough to be worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Pirates Rob Farmers: A few nights ago, many sea bandits arrived at He Village in Changshu County and robbed the homes of villagers such as Zhou. After looting, the bandits fled into the Yangtze River. Afterwards, the captain of the first detachment of the 13th water police team rushed to pursue them and reported to the third water police district yesterday (20th) requesting arrest.</p>
<p>The High Court Executes a Murderer: Xiao Lao, a native of Taixing, and his wife Zhao had known their neighbor Zhou Jixiang for a long time. At that time, Xiao Lao was experiencing financial difficulties and was repeatedly assisted by Zhou Jixiang. Until March of the 13th year of the Republic of China, Xiao planned to take Zhao and his son Que'er to Huzhou. When Zhou heard about this, he also wanted to go to Jiangnan to make a living with his younger brother Zhou Zhishan and apprentice Song Genqing. They hired Zhu Genyi's boat together on March 3rd of the same year. When they reached the middle of the river, Zhou Jixiang recalled that Zhao had been having an affair with him for many years and had spent a lot of money, so he demanded 60 yuan from Xiao, which led to a dispute. Zhou Jixiang immediately cut Xiao's hand with a knife and pushed him into the river. The boatman Zhu Genyi rescued him and brought him back on board before he died. When the boat docked, Zhou claimed that he would accompany Xiao Lao to Changzhou for treatment and ordered his apprentice Song Genqing to carry him to the beach. Zhou then used a knife to stab Xiao to death. The Changzhou police arrested Zhou and brought him to the county for trial. He was sentenced to death. Zhou refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the High Court, which also sentenced him to death. Zhou still refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Supreme Court, which also rejected his appeal. A few days ago, the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office ordered the High Court Prosecutor's Office to execute Zhou Jixiang. After receiving the order, the High Prosecutor's Office ordered Prosecutor Zhu Wenzhuo to go to the Sijian Street Third Prison execution ground at 7:00 a.m. yesterday (20th) and order the bailiff to bring Zhou Jixiang to confirm his identity and execute him by hanging according to the law.</p>

<p>Kidnapping Case: Bandits Intimidate Victim: At the intersection of Jingyun and Taibo markets in this county, a place called Xiaoqiaotou, a large number of lake bandits armed with weapons robbed and kidnapped seven men during the Mid-Autumn Festival of the lunar calendar this year. Two of them were later released. Afterwards, police detectives from this county cracked the case in Shanghai and arrested 19 bandits. Two hostages were also rescued by the Shanghai police. The other three hostages were hidden by the bandits in another boat and escaped without a trace. Recently, the bandits sent another letter to the victim Ling Dixiang, stating that the sender has received the four letters from the main force. They were waiting for the designated representatives to come to negotiate an agreement. If they desired a settlement, they should send the agreed amount to a specific location and not self-sabotage. Ling ignored the letter after receiving it. It was said that several days ago Ling Yuanxiang said that the bandits sent a letter saying that the bandits guarding the hostages were suffering, and that the boats the bandits were on were now located at Jiangyin.</p>
<p>Police and Bandits Engage in Fierce Battle in Taihu Lake: Recently, bandits have been discovered in Taihu Lake, in the Dongting West Mountain area, robbing civilian boats and kidnapping people for ransom. Wang Shengwu, the captain of the 8th water police team stationed in Dongshan, learned of this and led a team to suppress them. They encountered the bandits at Mingwan, and saw four bandit boats with eighty or ninety bandits armed with guns. Captain Wang immediately joined forces with the 3rd district water police of Jiangsu and the local militia to engage the bandits in a fierce battle for four hours. The bandit forces are running low. Some of them are in Xiaogang. The police are now searching and dividing them up. Yesterday, Captain Wang telegraphed the situation of the bandit suppression to Mao Mujun, the district director of the 2nd water police district stationed . After receiving the telegram, Mao immediately ordered the Zhaowu warship to sail to Taihu Lake to assist in the encirclement and suppression, striving to annihilate all of the bandits.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>A Thug Who Uses Fear and Intimidation is Arrested Within the City: Wang, a manager for the Datong, Dafeng, Dayun, and Dachunghua companies, resided at 42 Juqian Street, within the city. Recently, he has received three threatening letters from a thug. The first demanded 5,000 dollars, the second decreased the amount to 1,000, and the third decreased the amount to 500. It was said that this amount should be carefully wrapped in newspaper and sent to the the Gongyi Galvanization Factory in Zhongshangmen no later than the 19th. At the same time, the Yingchunqiao Yuanchangtai Rice Shop and Xinchang Rice Shop also received similar letters. They would bring the amount of money for delivery to a similar location and time. Wang Xilin discussed and thought of ways with the Division Chief of Police Officer No.1 Tong Rengin, 10th Water Police squad leader Hann, and the Captain of the Patrol Squad. On the morning of the 19th, the police squad were disguised and set up an ambush. Then, a person was sent to bring the fake amount of dollar bills to the designated area. The ambushers gave a signal for the police to rush the suspects that arrived for the money. One of the suspects was Jiang Yinda. The other suspect was Song Shuangda. Both suspects pointed out the one that was the mastermind behind it all, Song Erda. Then, he was found and arrested at Yingchun Teahouse. The suspect, Yang Quangsheng, and 5 others, were found in a search conducted in Yangguo Village.</p>

<p>A Traditional Chinese Doctor, Zhang Chengqi, Escapes from a Bandit Den and Returns to His Hometown: Zhang Chengqi, a traditional Chinese doctor practicing in Xiyangzhen in the mountain area, was kidnapped together with Zhang Baoqi and three others by the bandit Zou Quixuan last month. The bandits, via Da'an Port, sent a letter to Zhang's family demanding a ransom of four thousand yuan. When the family went to pay the ransom, the bandits demanded seven thousand yuan to release Zhang and the others at the same time. Zhang's family, lacking such a large sum and having no connection with Zhang Baoqi and the others, couldn't fulfill the demand. The bandits insisted on the joint ransom of seven thousand yuan because they were unwilling to release Zhang. Zhang, who had been practicing traditional Chinese medicine for decades and was well-known in the Xiyang and Fushan area, was asked by the bandits to be their resident doctor after being kidnapped. The bandits treated Zhang extremely well, providing him with separate room and assigning several bandits to serve him in shifts, while still keeping him under surveillance, albeit loosely. Zhang, seeking to escape his captivity, feigned compliance with the bandits. Recently, the counties of Tongzhou and Haizhou launched a large-scale campaign to suppress the bandits, resulting in fierce fighting for two days and nights. The bandits, unable to withstand the assault, retreated to Songji Port. The bandit leader was arrested, and the bandit gang fell into disarray. Zhang seized the opportunity to escape, fleeing for dozens of miles without rest. He arrived in Nantong territory on the 18th and then took a boat back home. It is reported that Zhang will rest for a few days before resuming his practice to make a living. Zhang Baoqi and the others are still in danger.</p>
<p>Yao Weicai Commits Suicide by Drinking Tranquilizing Medicine: Yao Weicai, a shareholder of Yifengchang Sugar Store outside Xiaodongmen in this county, was thirty-three years old. He lost his father at a young age and was raised by his aunt. He later studied in Kunshan and returned to join Xiao Fuchang, Lu Fengshan, and others to open a sugar store. Initially, Yao was solely responsible for management, but due to losses, Lu was made manager instead. Yao was only in charge of economic income and expenses, and his father-in-law was asked to introduce and guarantee loans from the money shop. Unexpectedly, Xiao and Lu colluded to embezzle accounts and funds. As the end of the year approached, Yao, seeing no hope for the store's development, planned to commit suicide. On the evening of the 18th, he still had dinner at home before going to the store to sleep. The next morning, when Yao did not wake up, they went to call him, only to find him barely breathing and unresponsive. Realizing something was wrong, they informed his wife, Cao, who rushed over and found two bottles of tranquilizing medicine. It was then they knew he had taken poison. They quickly called a Western doctor to save him, but it was in vain. He died at around nine o'clock. His wife, Cao, knowing the inside story of the store and suspecting that her husband's suicide was related to Xiao and Lu, went to the Public Security Bureau to report the matter. Xiao and Lu were arrested and taken to the county judicial office. At two o'clock in the afternoon, the trial officer, Shen Hengsheng, opened the court for interrogation. According to Cao's statement, Yao Weicai left a handwritten grievance document consisting of thirteen pages before his death. Interrogating Lu and Xiao revealed that they were likely involved. They were ordered to be released on bail. Cao was allowed to arrange the burial of the body first.</p>

<p>A Glimpse of Bandit Rampancy: In recent years, in the Jiangbei Lixiahe area, in addition to sea bandits and local bandits, there are also Xiao bandits. The Yiling and Beita River areas of Yangzhou are all gathering places for the Shou and Si gangs. They used to be engaged in selling salt, but recently they have also been abducting and selling rural women. The number of victims is countless. Last month, Zhang Tiancheng's wife, aged nineteen, of the fourth township, Beixun Village, Yetianzhuang, Dongxiang, Jiangdu, was abducted by Xiao bandits and sold to a village in Shouzhou. Tiancheng knew about it but dared not sue, showing how afraid he was of the Xiao bandits' ferocity. It is my hope that those with the responsibility of pacifying the local area will pay close attention to this.</p>

As a result, the provincial government immediately suspended his commission. The principal claimed that he had worked extremely hard in the school for two years and was deeply saddened by this accusation. Therefore, he sent a letter to the school's students studying abroad to take charge of the situation. As a result, the students were extremely moved upon hearing the news. It is reported that they will organize school activities when they return for the New Year holiday.</p>

<p>Paper Shop Closes Down with a Loss of Seventeen Thousand Yuan: The Kong Fumao paper shop on Dongmen Street in Xiaoshan has been open since the early years of the Guangxu reign in the late Qing dynasty.

<p>Public Security Bureau Investigator Flees Ningbo After Bending the Law: After a tip-off from citizens Wang Agan and Zhong Tongzhang, Yin Kui, an investigator from the Ningbo Public Security Bureau, went to the Xiehe Southern Goods Store opened by a Fujianese on Houtang Street in Jiangdong to search for opium. As a result, they found three packages of opium and smoking paraphernalia, as well as three pistols under the bed. Seeing that things were not going well, the store owner bribed the investigator with two hundred yuan. The investigator returned one of the pistols and privately pocketed the other two, fearing that Wang and Zhong, who had gone with him, would leak the matter. At the time, he gave Wang and Zhong twenty yuan each. Unexpectedly, someone later reported the matter to the detective team. The team, upon receiving the report, dispatched detectives to arrest Wang and Zhong first and summoned Wang Zhengjing, a witness from Xiehe Company, to the case.

<h3>Correspondence from the Ministry of Railways</h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Having read your newspaper's report on the 18th of this month, in the Xuzhou dispatch, it was said that "(Jinpu Bureau Director Sun Hegao, accompanied by Railway Department Vice Minister Lian Shenghai, passed through Xuzhou on the 19th morning en route to Tianjin)." Upon investigation, this does not correspond with the facts. Our department's Vice Minister Lian did not leave the department that day. The report in your newspaper that he passed through Xuzhou en route to Tianjin is an erroneous report.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we request that you promptly make a correction.</p>
<p>Secretariat of the Ministry of Railways, December 19th.</p>
<p>Special Educational News</p>
<h3>Life at Wellesley College</h3>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>(Sent from the United States by Ms. Lu Erzhao of Songjiang)</p>
<p>(1) Overview of the School</p>
<p>It seems advisable for women seeking education in the United States to go to this school first.</p>
<p>Wellesley College is located in Meigen Province, USA. The school covers an area of more than 600 acres. The newly built buildings are grand in scale and complete in equipment. The library, laboratories, gymnasium, and auditorium are particularly emphasized as the source of the four aspects of education: moral, intellectual, physical, and aesthetic. The curriculum is divided into departments such as education, literature, home economics, sociology, theology, mathematics, physics, chemistry, physical education, law, and political science, with more students in the education, literature, home economics, sociology, and theology departments. Each classroom has a clock and the school regulations stipulate that if a student is one minute late, the professor must record it and report it to the office. Teachers can be up to a quarter of an hour late, but teachers and students are never late.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the teaching in each department is rigorous, and special attention is paid to mutual assistance, service, and physical fitness training.</p>
<p>(A) Training in Mutual Assistance and Service: At the three prayer meetings each week, there must be a lecture on the ancient events and principles of mutual assistance and service, nothing more than embracing the spirit of Christ (I serve others, not others serve me). Teachers use this to teach students, and students use this to learn. If you immerse yourself in it for a long time, you will be able to change your temperament. Although there are many enthusiastic public welfare and mutual assistance service facts in our country recently, there are also those who regard local public interests as the moonlight in front of the window and the frost on the roof tiles, and push them away without caring. There are many selfish and self-interested people in the Western countries, but they are often regarded by society as Jews (a synonym for slaves of the country). The causes of the environment are different, and the results of the nation are also different. Those who are engaged in educational positions should carefully study it.</p>
<p>(B) Compulsory Physical Training: Ball games and freehand exercises are of course practiced conscientiously, and practical tests in the swimming pool are regarded as major subjects. The president's advocacy, the teacher's training, the encouragement of points, and the students' hard work, coupled with the exquisite equipment in the pool that attracts people, make the swimming pleasure arise unconsciously. This is true for American women. Japanese people are mostly known for their swimming skills. Students from my alma mater, both Chinese and Western, often become healthier after a year of studying here. Therefore, a female physical education professor said with a smile to Yu that after graduating and returning to China in a few years, she did not recognize her mother because she was so strong. The teacher is probably proud of the physical education progress of each student.</p>
<p>This school is one of the pure women's universities in the United States. It was founded earlier, and there are more graduates. Ms. Wang Xi of Wusong, is known for her intelligence. Her aunt and niece both graduated from this school. The wife of Dr. Meng of Huzhou also graduated from this school. Next year (1931), her daughter will also make an appointment to study at this school. There are more than a dozen alumni from the Shanghai Zhongxi School who have come here, most of whom have graduated and returned to China to serve. This school has a reputation for treating Chinese people favorably. It seems advisable for women seeking education in the United States to go to this school first.</p>
<h3>(2) Teacher Attitude</h3>
<p>Most of the teachers are women, many of whom are old, respected, white-haired, wrinkled, experienced, and have excellent teaching methods. When they take the stage to lecture, they are energetic, their words are calm, and in important places, they often go over them again and again, ordering each student to find the key points themselves and strive to solve them automatically. Only when each student can know where the knot is and thoroughly understand it will they stop patiently teaching. Their spirit of never tiring of teaching is truly enough to make each student sincerely admire them. During the exam, they choose to ask questions about the essentials, and if each student can analyze and answer in detail, they will give full marks. Some people say that the reason why each teacher is so sincere in their guidance and never slackens is because they hold the doctrine of love for people, the doctrine of service, that is, the doctrine of sacrifice. They often said to each student that if you have talent, knowledge, and experience but no love for people, service, and sacrifice, then your innate talent, all your knowledge, and experience are equal to castles in the air, useless and may even harm society. These few words are also regarded as mottos by Erzhao. Erzhao carefully considers why each teacher at this school is so earnest: one is because they hold religious doctrines, two is that female teachers have special care for female students, and three is that each teacher regards education as a lifelong career, liking it and enjoying it. If they initially regard the school as a post office or a rain shelter, they will not take the school as a means of earning a living and do things perfunctorily for the students.</p>

<h3>Jiaotong University Held Groundbreaking Ceremony for Engineering Building Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since Sun Zhesheng and Li Rousheng took over the leadership of National Jiaotong University, they have spared no effort to expand the content. Recently, the school's construction funds approved by the Ministry have reached more than 550,000 yuan, the most important of which is the construction of the Engineering Building. After the funds were warned, the school immediately solicited bids, and the result was contracted by Fuchi. At 12:30 noon yesterday, the school specially held a groundbreaking ceremony for the Engineering Building. Minister Sun was unable to come to the school temporarily due to something, and President Li Zhaohuan wielded the hoe to perform the ceremony and reported on everything. Finally, Professor Hu Dunfu gave a speech. The main points of the speeches of Li and Hu are as follows:</p>
<p>President Li reported in brief that the construction, equipment, and machinery costs of the Engineering Building to be built by the school this time are about 600,000 yuan. In recent years, the Ministry's funds have been stretched. The early commencement of the school's Engineering Building is both in accordance with the Ministry of Education's intention to expand the content and due to Minister Sun's efforts to raise funds. It is expected that the building can be completed in August next year and all the renovations can be completed between September and October. It is planned to hold the opening ceremony of the building at the same time as the school's 35th anniversary. The interior of the Engineering Building is divided into three floors. The lower floor is planned to be an electrical engineering laboratory, a materials laboratory, a mechanical laboratory, and a metalworking factory. The second floor will be used for two large classrooms, a drawing classroom, the offices of the various deans, a teacher's lounge, and an instrument room. The third floor will not be built for the time being and is planned to be added later when funds are sufficient. A circular open space is left in the building to prepare for the future addition of engineering or science and railway museums. Such a grand engineering building is rare in China. After the completion of this building next year, the school's reputation can be increased, and it will also meet the Ministry of Education's intention to enrich the content. The completion of this building will also make a great contribution to China's engineering science in the future. With this good material environment, the students of this school must also strive for knowledge in the spiritual aspect, etc.</p>
<p>Dr. Hu Dunfu's speech. Hu briefly stated that the commencement of the school's engineering project this time can be the foundation for all new construction in the school. He hoped that the students would study hard and not let down the party-state's cultivation of talents and the earnest expectations of the authorities, etc.</p>
<h3>Declaration by Guanghua Students Regarding the Current Situation</h3>
<p>(National News Agency) Guanghua University students of this city, including Li Jing and 251 others, declared: "We came to Shanghai to study at Guanghua University, considering it one of the leading universities by the sea. It emerged from the cultural encroachment of imperialism (John), shedding its Fumin facade and possessing a glorious revolutionary history. Unexpectedly, in recent years, those in charge have been unsuitable. Allowing the Nationalist faction to thrive, they regard figures like Lin Cheng, who collaborates with powerful figures, as their stronghold. Since Liao Shicheng, a running dog of Sun Chuanfang, the warlord of Dongda University, and a supporter of the Five-Colored Flag Datong League, became the president, he has gathered his cronies and occupied key positions, such as Luo Longji, Zhu Qinglai, and Shen Youqian. They usually advocate theories of freedom and constitutionalism to oppose the government and criticize the authorities, thereby misleading students. Each adheres to his own interpretation of freedom, but when it comes to university affairs, they suppress and prohibit without reason. The promotion of party ideology education is evident in the resolutions of the Third National Congress and the orders of party and government organs, even down to the elementary schools. However, Guanghua, a university with a glorious revolutionary history, not only lacks courses on party ideology but also never holds memorial weeks. The unity of knowledge and action, an old saying of Wang Yangming, runs contrary to 'knowledge is easy but action is difficult,' which has long been refuted by the Premier. Anyone with a little understanding of party ideology can tell this. Yet, Liao Shicheng not only deviates from his teacher's teachings but also brazenly imparts training and education to students, just as Tao Zhihxing, a prominent Nationalist faction member, did at Xiaozhuang School. How can we not feel that we are not alone and that we will be compared favorably in the future? Since Liao has followed in Tao's footsteps, Guanghua will inevitably end up like Xiaozhuang. The thought fills us with dread. Previously, local party and government organs investigated and confirmed the situation, reported it to the Ministry of Education, which issued a reprimand and ordered rectification. However, Liao simply laughed it off, as if he saw nothing. His betrayal of the spirit of party ideology education is enough to exemplify the rest. Even from the standpoint of the Nationalist faction itself, this is understandable. But look at today's church schools, which even add courses on party ideology and observe memorial weeks. It is unbelievable that Guanghua, which emerged from opposing the church, is so absurd. What difference is there between Guanghua and John? Guanghua should be ashamed, while John is laughing at it. We, as students, witness this and feel heartbroken. For the sake of loving our school, we cannot remain silent. But speaking out is often suppressed with the excuse that students cannot interfere in university affairs. Remaining silent would be a betrayal of our conscience. Enduring this reactionary education of the Nationalist faction day after day without being able to clear ourselves is truly heartbreaking, and we cannot help but sigh deeply for the future of party ideology education. This time, the Nanfeng Society and the Lanling Society had a dispute over a soccer game. Liao, because he despised the shamelessness of the Nationalist faction and refused to be exploited by them, harbors resentment towards the Nanfeng Society and secretly instructs his running dogs to deliberately sow discord, causing the conflict between the two sides to escalate, thereby creating an opportunity to eliminate dissidents. His means are more ruthless than Zheng Zhuang Gong. As expected, within a few days, expulsion orders were issued, and ten innocent classmates were sacrificed. Yang Shuchun is not even a member of the Nanfeng Society, but simply because he is a standing committee member of a district branch, he was also sacrificed as a collateral victim. Such perverse actions cause people to feel bewildered and uneasy. Liao's party of rebellious students then seized the opportunity to run amok, arbitrarily disregarding everything. Slogans and shouts such as '(Down with the Kuomintang),' '(Down with Chiang Kai-shek),' and '(Long live Nationalism)' filled the air, and Communist leaflets were also flying around. Seeing this behavior, we felt that we could no longer tolerate it. However, we still did not want to deviate from the normal course. On the one hand, we expressed our opinions to President Zhang, demanding the expulsion of Nationalist faction teachers and staff such as Liao Shicheng and Luo Longji. On the other hand, we united with our classmates and waited quietly for a solution. We disdained the most inferior actions such as strikes, coercion, external declarations, and exaggeration in the hope of escalating the situation. Therefore, although there was a proposal for a strike declaration among the students at that time, the fact that we unanimously opposed and rejected it is enough to prove our attitude. However, Liao knew that the situation had become unmanageable and that the facts were undeniable. Therefore, he tried his best to instigate his private party teachers to distort the facts and issue declarations in order to shift the blame to the students and avoid social condemnation. Little did he know that he was trying to cover up his heinous crimes. A dispute over soccer is a matter between students. There is no need to expel a large number of students. And expelling students is a matter for the school. There is no need to issue external declarations. Yet, he uses dangerous words and exaggerates the situation. Whether this kind of provocative action violates the orders of the Executive Yuan, the world will have its own judgment. The responsibility for the escalation of the situation lies with him. We were originally waiting quietly for a solution. However, since the reactionary faction teachers have already distorted the facts, we cannot allow them to slander us. Therefore, we are making the truth public to set the record straight. In short, we started with loving our school and will end with loving our school. We started with expelling Liao and will end with expelling Liao. If we do not achieve the goal of thoroughly expelling all Nationalist factions in the school, we would rather be shattered jade than preserved tile. We hope that people from all walks of life will rise up and help us." Guanghua University students Li Jing and 251 others.</p>

<h3>Preparations for Jinan Football Team's Expedition to the Philippines</h3>
<p>Departing on January 6 to Participate in Charity Matches</p>
<p>Farewell Ceremony for the Zhenru Basketball Team Tomorrow, Who Will Also Be Traveling</p>
<p>Since the National Jinan University Football Team received a formal invitation from the Philippine Sports Association, representing the government of that country, to participate in charity and carnival matches, Director of Physical Education Chen Zhang'e and Coach Wu Yanzhang have been actively preparing for departure.</p>
<p>Participating in Charity Matches</p>
<p>The team will leave Shanghai on January 6 and arrive in Manila on the 12th. The match schedule has not yet been finalized, but the charity matches will generally be held from January 15 to 18. In the week or so before and after these four days, Jinan's interest in soccer matches has been very high lately. Jinan's trip carries the name of national representative, and the warm welcome it will receive from overseas Chinese can be imagined. The strong opponents in the charity matches will include the university teams of Santo Tomas University, Sarasa University, and Anthony University. In addition, there will be the Narmada team organized by the British, the Cacheño team from Spain, and the Philippine team.</p>
<p>Will Compete in Hong Kong Upon Return</p>
<p>Whether to continue participating in the Carnival after the closing of the charity matches will be determined based on the circumstances at that time. If the entire team returns to the country, it is planned to leave the Philippines on the Canadian Empress on January 28. When passing through Hong Kong, they will land and compete with China or Nanhua before going to Guangzhou, where Huang Dengqiu and Dr. Situ You will be in charge of the arrangements. By the time they arrive in Shanghai, the elite players of the team may be able to contribute to the Chinese team for the World Soccer Cup.</p>
<p>Farewell Reception Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Philippine Overseas Chinese Student Association of the school has scheduled a dance party at the Dahua Hotel Ballroom on Gordon Road from 4 PM to 8:30 PM tomorrow. The program will be quite spectacular. In addition, a special edition of the expedition to the Philippines will be published, with rich content planned by Mr. Cai Guoping and others.</p>
<p>Zhenru Basketball Team Recruiting Warriors</p>
<p>Will Follow the Jinan Football Team on an Expedition to the Philippines</p>
<p>The Zhenru Basketball Team is strong. In the current Xiqing League, they have won five out of five games, maintaining a score of 1,000 points, and have a great chance of competing with the Pirates. They will follow the Jinan Football Team on an expedition to the Philippines in the new year. Philippine basketball is renowned internationally and has won the championship at the Ninth Far Eastern Games. Their strength far exceeds that of Shanghai. Although the Zhenru Basketball Team has a considerable position in Shanghai, this trip is also for the purpose of increasing its strength. They wish to recruit several elite players from Shanghai to accompany them on the expedition to the Philippines. Although the Philippines has won the Far Eastern Championship in basketball, this team is not competing against the Philippine national team but against the clubs and schools of various units. With the Zhenru team's skills, it seems that they can handle the situation with ease and have a chance of winning. The cost of the trip will be borne by the Philippine Charity Association, and the cost of the uniforms will be borne by Jinan University. Those who wish to respond to the call should contact them quickly. Starting next week, practice will be held at the Chinese Basketball Hall at 2:00 PM on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, with Chen Zhang'e, Director of Physical Education at Jinan University, as the coach and Sha Nanwen or Shi Guihua of the Pirates team as the planner.</p>

<h3>Negotiations on the Submarine Cable Abolition Treaty</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications insists on three specific principles, but the three companies have yet to respond.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Yantai-Dagu submarine cable to be taken back tomorrow</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has finalized its plan for negotiations with the Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific companies regarding the abolition of the submarine cable treaty. Representatives from the three companies have been formally requested to come to Beijing as soon as possible to continue discussions. Both sides are expected to adopt a sincere attitude and conclude a new contract within this year. Otherwise, since the old contract will expire at the end of this year, the Chinese government, to maintain its sovereignty, will have no choice but to declare the termination of all contractual relations with the companies. This reporter interviewed Wang Boqun, Minister of Communications, yesterday and inquired about this matter. He stated that the three companies have yet to respond since the ministry issued the letter.</p>
<p>Key issues in negotiation</p>
<p>Minister Wang also stated that the crux of the submarine cable treaty abolition negotiations lies in the following points. The three companies have already acknowledged abandoning the patent rights. What they are now contesting are: (1) the duration of landing rights, for which they are requesting twenty years; (2) the right to send and receive; and (3) the apportionment of electricity costs.</p>
<p>Specific principles</p>
<p>The specific principles that the Chinese side adheres to in the submarine cable negotiations are: (1) to strive to shorten the duration of landing rights; (2) the three companies are requesting the freedom to send and receive, but acknowledge China's right of supervision, while the Chinese side insists on having both the right to send and receive and the right of management; and (3) regarding the apportionment of electricity costs, the Chinese side insists that it should be equal to the apportionment methods stipulated in the contracts between those companies and other countries, and there should be no discrimination whatsoever.</p>
<p>Repurchase at assessed price</p>
<p>Minister Wang then stated that China has decided to repurchase the Shanghai-Yantai-Dagu submarine cable at an assessed price, which is scheduled to be implemented on the 22nd of this month. Part of the price will be mortgaged to the banking sector with telecommunications public bonds, and another part will be allocated by the Remittance Bureau. Although five million yuan of telecommunications public bonds have been issued, they currently have no market value due to the lack of a solid fund, so they have to be temporarily mortgaged to the banking sector.</p>
<p>Zhenru Radio Station</p>
<p>When a reporter inquired about the progress of the Sino-Japanese telecommunications negotiations, he replied that the Sino-Japanese telecommunications negotiations opened in Beijing today (i.e., yesterday), and the results are not yet known. When asked when the Zhenru Radio Station will be able to communicate with France, Minister Wang replied that the construction, equipment, machinery, and other costs of the Zhenru Radio Station totaled more than two million yuan, and the results are quite good. Communication between China and France will be implemented in the near future. Next, communication between China and Britain will be carried out. The Fenglinqiao international branch station communicates with the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Java, but the various machinery and equipment of the radio station are not yet fully complete. It is estimated that an additional investment of one million yuan will be needed to achieve a large-scale operation. The Ministry of Communications is actively planning the progress of the construction, he said.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation to Hold Board Meeting Today</h3>
<p>To Discuss the Aftermath of the Accident</p>
<p>Wang Boqun's Talk to Reporters</p>
<p>Minister of Communications Wang Boqun arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 7:00 a.m. on the overnight express train from Beijing. Wang, who is the chairman of the board of directors of the China National Aviation Corporation, intends to convene a board meeting in Shanghai to discuss the responsibilities, compensation, and aftermath issues related to the crash of Shanghai Airplane No. 2. This reporter visited him yesterday and inquired in detail. The details of Mr. Wang's conversation are described below:</p>
<p>Board meeting</p>
<p>Wang stated that he has received a detailed report from the company regarding the plane crash. The board meeting is scheduled for 5:00 p.m. on the 21st (i.e., today) at the airline company. In addition to himself, the attendees will include Vice Minister Wei Yifu, Division Chief Liu Shufan, and American directors Poiin and Hamilton. The main scope of the meeting is to discuss various issues related to the aftermath. At that time, he also intends to summon the relevant personnel to inquire in detail about all the circumstances at that time for research.</p>
<p>Responsibility for the accident</p>
<p>Wang also stated that regarding the issue of responsibility for the accident, because the pilot and mechanical assistant of the Shanghai airplane have both died, there is no one to testify. Therefore, it is impossible to understand the circumstances of the flight and the airplane's machinery at that time. Moreover, the true cause of the accident cannot be explained. According to the company's report, the flight was quite low at the time, and it took off along the riverbank. The reason why it flew so low and along the riverbank was whether the airplane's machinery was damaged and it was necessary to land urgently on the river beach, or whether there were other reasons. So far, there is no evidence, so it can only be regarded as speculation and cannot be used as practical evidence.</p>
<p>Yang Yongtai's words</p>
<p>Wang continued, stating that all of these are factual difficulties. He went to the Baolong Hospital today (i.e., yesterday) to visit Mr. Yang Yongtai. Yang's spirits were quite good. He immediately asked about what happened at that time. According to him, Commander Xiong had fallen on top of him when the plane crashed. At that time, he felt quite uncomfortable and had difficulty breathing. He thought that the flight was too high and the air was thin, but he did not know that a major disaster had occurred. Yang was the least injured of the seven and was the most clear-headed at the time, and he was still confused. Moreover, he further stated that China does not have an aviation law, and even other countries lack it. Therefore, the issue of responsibility for the accident can only be handled with emotion rather than law. Regarding the issue of compensation for the dead and injured, Wang stated that the two pilots who died were company employees and should be given generous compensation. The compensation for the passengers should be submitted to the board of directors for further decision.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Yixing aviation</p>
<p>When asked when the Shanghai-Yixing aviation route will be opened, Wang replied that because the Shanghai airplane has crashed and there is a shortage of both airplanes and personnel, the expansion of the route has to be slowed down slightly. It is expected to be realized around January or February of next year. The Shanghai-Beijing route is still being planned. In the future, the company will carefully examine the driving talents and the airplane parts and components to ensure that they are foolproof. This matter should also be submitted to the board of directors for discussion and ways to rectify it, he said.</p>
<h3>Customs Suspends Collection of Internal Transit Duties</h3>
<p>Joint Proclamation by the Superintendent of Customs and the Customs Commissioner</p>
<p>Internal Transit Duties and Re-Import Half Duty</p>
<p>Liu Jiwen, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, and Mei Weiliang, Customs Commissioner, issued a joint proclamation stating that they received an order from the Ministry of Finance to cancel and cease the collection of all Internal Transit Duties and Re-Import Half Duty on goods entering and leaving the inland, starting from January 1, 1931. They are required to comply accordingly, and all merchants are hereby notified.</p>

<p>Declaration of the General Assembly:</p>
<p>Declaration of the Inaugural Meeting of the Shanghai Women's Association for the Promotion of Domestic Goods</p>
<p>Since the preparation of this association, we have deeply relied on the efforts of the founders to solicit comrades, and after several discussions, the framework has been roughly established. The general assembly is thus established. Coinciding with the beginning of national unification, peace, and construction, colleagues feel that the national duty cannot be abandoned, and resolutely take on the responsibility of promoting domestic goods. We hereby list the three aspects of our future efforts for our female compatriots:</p>
<p>(1) To promote domestic goods, we should arouse deep understanding and adhere to it permanently, and not leave the criticism of a five-minute enthusiasm. In the past, the movement to promote domestic goods has been surging, no less than the excitement of stimulating nerves. If it loses its effect, some intellectuals with weak national consciousness will criticize it as useless to promote domestic goods without making efforts to produce. This statement seems right but is not, because it is hoped that those who are in a semi-colonial status will make every effort to exclude foreign goods, so that domestic goods can be developed. According to the teachings of the President Sun Yat-sen, only by knowing and uniting with the group can we revitalize the national spirit and solve the people's livelihood. Today, this association will reveal the facts of foreign economic aggression as much as possible, so that our female compatriots will be awe-inspiring in the life and death of the nation and will strive to reduce the fierce flames of foreign goods in the market. This is the first goal that this association aims to strive for.</p>
<p>(2) To promote the use of domestic goods, we must set an example and create a trend. For decades, foreign goods have gradually formed a deep and unshakable foundation in the Chinese market, even reaching remote areas. Almost all of the necessities of life, clothing, food, and daily use, are supplied by foreign goods. The reason for this is not only due to the deliberate efforts of imperialists to hold special forces and carry out economic oppression, but also due to the depression of the national spirit, the loss of self-confidence, and the psychology of worshiping foreign goods and despising domestic goods in our country. Consider, my female compatriots in Shanghai, it is undeniable that there are many who love beauty, keep up with the times, and compete with each other to pursue luxury and desire and love foreign goods. The trend is so strong throughout the country! However, living in a foreign country, I have seen desolate borders and starving compatriots, who are being exploited by foreign goods. We should consider the difficulty of building a new country and the fact that the entire nation has not been freed from shackles. From now on, we should break the boat and completely ban imported luxury goods. Even if there are domestic goods available for daily use, we must not buy foreign goods again. We should swear to be sincere and establish it as a creed. From oneself and one's family, we should extend it to the society and encourage each other to abide by it without change, in order to change the trend and turn the public will into a city. However, what should be stated here is that this kind of movement is by no means out of a negative thought of restraining desire. We firmly believe that the enjoyment of materials must be based on one's own creation. If there is no contribution to the international community, but only to use the blood and sweat of compatriots to exchange for the boasting of the civilization of life, it is a shameful act of stagnation. We hope that the talented and wise men of the country will strive to create material civilization, reap one point and enjoy one point, be down-to-earth and not be involved in emptiness. This is the second goal that this association aims to strive for.</p>
<p>(3) To strive to promote domestic goods and state opinions on improving manufacturing. In recent years, the domestic goods industry has made considerable progress, and the necessary daily necessities are largely complete. Unfortunately, it has not been able to produce in large quantities, and sometimes the excellent quality cannot be maintained permanently. In the future, this association will strive to promote the excellent domestic goods, promote their production and sales, and promote their advantages and expand them. Even for inferior products, we will not hesitate to point them out truthfully and hope that industrialists will step up their improvements. As for the fundamental plan for developing domestic goods, we should discuss and study the one-sided views and contribute them to the party and government authorities and the industrial and commercial sectors for adoption. We also plan to contact domestic goods manufacturers from time to time to hold exhibitions of various clothing, food, household goods, etc., to gather the essence and allow people to visit and observe, and to arouse their love and desire to purchase. This is the third goal that this association aims to strive for. All the shame of being insulted and ridiculed by the Shanghai women's community will be swept away by this effort, and the vain and extravagant people will see honesty and simplicity, and those who are leisurely and share the profits will see serving the society and saving the waste of family expenses to create the welfare of the people. From hating foreign goods to using domestic goods to participating in improving the manufacturing of domestic goods, our women's community should not shirk its responsibilities in the creation of a new country. From now on, we will determine this new concept, establish a new model for national women, unite as one, be diligent and courageous, and become the advocate for the whole country. This association treads on thin ice and seeks to realize it drop by drop. We hope that all the great men of the community will not hesitate to correct and supervise it. I am very fortunate and sincerely offer this declaration. December 20, 1930.</p>
<h3>Citywide Population of Over Three Million in October</h3>

<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau has monthly reports on population changes in the city. The September statistics were published in the previous report. It is now known that the bureau's October report shows that the number of households in the city is 186,425, with 176,953 attached households. The number of males is 979,727, and the number of females is 723,847. The number of foreign households is 2,032, with a population of 9,882.

<h3>Unfortunate Incident Involving Jianghai Merchant Ship</h3>
<p>Jianghua Runs Aground</p>
<p>The Jianghua ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which was coming to Shanghai from Hankou carrying a large amount of cargo, ran aground yesterday morning at six o'clock in Zhenjiang. The shipowner, Huang Muzong, believed that the Jianghua was heavily loaded and had a deep draft, so it could not berth at the pontoon. He suggested that the cargo be unloaded using barges, but the Zhenjiang Bureau Chief refused and ordered the ship to berth at the pier, which resulted in the ship running aground. The water there was very shallow. After the ship ran aground, a very dangerous situation arose. The shipowner Huang sent a telegram to the General Bureau, stating that the ship arrived in Zhenjiang at 5:30 this morning. The ship had a very deep draft. I strongly requested to transship the cargo, but the branch bureau ignored it and forced the ship to berth, resulting in the ship running aground. The situation was dire and it was impossible to get out of danger for a while. The bureau did not understand the stakes and insisted on its own way, without any room for negotiation, resulting in this disaster. After the telegram arrived in Shanghai, a second telegram was received at 4 p.m., stating that a small ship was dispatched this morning to tow the Jianghua, and anchors were used, but it was ineffective. The wind and waves blew in, and the tide receded, leaving no way to escape. We will try again when the tide rises. Huang Muzong continued to telegram, saying that the heavily loaded ship ran aground and was very dangerous. Please order the Emei ship, which is sailing upstream from Shanghai today, to Zhenjiang to tow the Jianghua. Also, please send a telegram to the Nanjing Branch Bureau to instruct the ships sailing downstream to detour Zhenjiang to assist in towing and avoid endangering the Jianghua. Yesterday, the Shanghai Bureau had already sent a telegram to the Zhenjiang Branch Bureau, instructing the branch chief to take immediate action to rescue the ship. At the same time, it also telegraphed all the Yangtze River ships sailing downstream to Shanghai to assist in the rescue. It is still unknown whether the ship's hull has been damaged.</p>
<p>Shipping accident</p>
<p>The merchant ship Xiersi of the German-owned North German Lloyd, managed by the American merchant house Meizui Shi Yanghang in this port, carried goods from Germany to Shanghai this time. After unloading the goods in Shanghai, it loaded soybeans and grains and transported them to Beiyang to be transshipped to Europe. On the 18th of this month, it loaded goods from Qingdao and went directly to Kobe. The ship encountered fog and heavy winds just outside the port of Kobe and crashed into a reef. Fortunately, the shipowner telegraphed Japan for help and backed up to escape the danger. Yesterday, a telegram came from Japan saying that a ship had been sent to tow it into Kobe. The ship's hull has been damaged and is currently being repaired at the Kobe shipyard. It will take about ten days to complete the project. The damage to the hull and the loss of goods are being investigated, and it is expected to leave the dock in Japan on the 31st of this month and then sail to Shanghai again.</p>
<h3>Discussion on the New Year Holiday Issue</h3>
<p>Should Be Handled in Accordance with the National Calendar</p>
<p>After the joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the City General Chamber of Commerce resolved to handle the current accounts in accordance with the resolutions of the State Council and agreed to set February 15, 1931, as the deadline, some people outside mistakenly thought that the New Year holiday would also be postponed until after February 15. The reporter of Xinsheng News Agency specially visited Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the City General Chamber of Commerce, yesterday to inquire about this issue. According to him, the New Year holiday should of course be handled in accordance with the usual customs of various industries in accordance with the National Calendar. The supplementary measures have also been clearly stipulated by the City Party Department and the City Social Affairs Bureau in the Joint Announcement No. 5096. As for the date of hiring and firing store employees, the General Chamber of Commerce has made a decision due to factual reasons, and is now preparing a document to submit to the government for record. Later, I also met with Wang Yansong, a member of the Standing Committee of the General Chamber of Commerce, who also said that the purpose of his proposal to set a deadline for handling accounts this time was entirely to remedy the commercial difficulties in fact. As for other issues, they should all be handled in accordance with the central government's regulations on promoting the National Calendar and cannot be associated with the deadline for handling accounts.</p>
<h3>Wuhu to Open Airmail Route</h3>
<p>Starting from the 23rd of This Month</p>
<p>It is heard from the Shanghai Postal Authorities that starting from the 23rd of this month, the China National Aviation Corporation's planes will stop in Wuhu. The airmail rates are the same as those for mailing to Nanjing, Jiujiang, Anqing, and Hankou.</p>
<h3>Continued Request to Maintain Original Silver Letter Postage on Chao-Shantou Railway</h3>
<p>Telegram from the Overseas Chinese Federation to the Ministry of Railways</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation received telegrams from the Ministry of Railways and the Shantou Overseas Chinese Silver Letter Bureau Association yesterday regarding the issue of increasing the shipping fees for overseas Chinese silver letters on the Chao-Shantou Railway. It immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Railways, stating: "Respectfully to Minister Sun of the Ministry of Railways in Nanjing, I have received your department's telegram No. 1751, in which you stated that you have learned about the issue of increasing the shipping fees for overseas Chinese silver letters on the Chao-Shantou Railway and have instructed the railway to investigate the details of this case and the previous fee collection methods and report them in detail for verification. Please be informed, etc." Just as we were preparing to reply to the Shantou Overseas Chinese Silver Letter Bureau Association, we received a telegram from the association stating that on the 11th of this month, the Chao-Shantou Railway Company sent a letter stating that the shipping fee for gold and silver currency worth 1,000 yuan would be one yuan, and that items worth less than 1,000 yuan would also be charged according to 1,000 yuan, and that this would be implemented on the 12th of this month. The association believes that the fixed shipping fee is almost doubled compared to the old one, and the deadline is very urgent. Therefore, it sent representatives to negotiate to follow the old method to show preferential treatment to overseas Chinese, and the remittance is carried by the remittance people themselves, which is obviously different from the distribution and cannot be limited to the same. However, the company's attitude is firm and it wants to implement it immediately. The association believes that the increase in fees is too large and harms the lives of overseas Chinese, so it has stopped sending remittances and sent telegrams to overseas Chinese organizations in various ports to appeal for the maintenance of the original method. It has also telegraphed the general association on the day of the letter, requesting that it be the hub of overseas Chinese to protect the interests of overseas Chinese. The President's love for overseas Chinese is to order the Chao-Shantou Railway to collect the remittance shipping fee for overseas Chinese remittances carried by themselves according to the original amount, so as to reduce the burden on overseas Chinese. The President's kindness to the overseas Chinese will be in line with our President. I am at your service."</p>
<h3>Business Meeting of the Two Railways Postponed</h3>
<p>At the Request of Representatives from Various Chambers of Commerce in Other Ports</p>
<p>Postponed to January 15 of Next Year</p>
<p>It was previously reported that the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration had selected January 5 of 1931 to convene a business meeting in order to develop its business. It is now known that the two railways recently received letters from representatives of various chambers of commerce in other ports, stating that all merchants are following the orders of the National Government to settle accounts and celebrate the New Year in accordance with the National Calendar. If they come to Shanghai immediately after the New Year to attend the meeting, there will be many inconveniences in fact, and they have requested a postponement. The railway authorities believe that this situation is indeed the case, so they have followed the request of the representatives and postponed the meeting date to January 15 of next year.</p>
<h3>Follow-up Reports on the典質 (Pawn Shop) Strike</h3>
<p>Arrested Workers: One Released, Three Sentenced</p>
<p>Two More Arrested Yesterday, Released Shortly After</p>
<p>Management Held a Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Revising Terms</p>
<p>Yesterday was the third day of the pawn shop workers' strike. All pawn shops in the city remained closed. The four workers arrested the day before were sentenced by the Special District Court yesterday. Three were sentenced to three weeks of detention, while one was immediately released due to wrongful arrest. The strike committee sent a letter to He Kang Pawn Shop, demanding responsibility. Two more workers were arrested yesterday but released shortly after. Management held a meeting yesterday to discuss revising the terms of worker treatment in order to attend the Party Headquarters today for mediation. The situation of both labor and management yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<p>Labor News</p>
<p>Investigation of Arrests: Before 8:00 AM yesterday, investigation teams from various districts set out to investigate whether pawn shops were on strike. Around 9:00 AM, Zhu Haicheng and Fan Rongfa were dispatched by the Central District Special Team Leader to Yikang Pawn Shop on Tiemalu Road to persuade them, when a "bao tan" (detective) arrived and took them to Hongkou Police Station for temporary detention. After the inspector inquired and found that they had not disturbed public order, they were released. All other pawn shops in various districts remained on strike throughout the day and did not open.</p>
<p>Court Ruling: At 3:40 PM the day before yesterday,</p>
<p>Workers Cheng Guangzu, Shao Chunsheng, Wang Junyan, and Zhou Hanyun were arrested by the Harbin Road Police Station while persuading He Kang Pawn Shop on Dongjiaxing Road to close. They were detained. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, they were transferred to the Sixth Tribunal of the Special District Court for questioning. Huang Shenkang, manager of He Kang Pawn Shop, appeared in court as the plaintiff. Li Fulin and Zhu Tianqi were dispatched as worker representatives to attend the hearing. As a result of the trial, Cheng Guangzu, Shao Chunsheng, and Wang Junyan were deemed to have disrupted order by entering He Kang Pawn Shop and forcing a strike, and each was sentenced to three weeks of detention. Zhou Hanyun was immediately released because he did not enter He Kang Pawn Shop and was merely observing. Cheng Guangzu, Shao Chunsheng, and Wang Junyan declared in court that they refused to accept the verdict and filed an appeal. The workers' union also hired a lawyer yesterday to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court at any time.</p>
<p>Petition to Protect the Pawn Shop Workers' Union: Because the strike has been orderly this time, but investigators have been arrested by the police, the union feels endangered and has petitioned the Municipal Party Headquarters and the People's Training Committee to provide protection for the workers and sent representatives Wang Ganchen and Deng Dunli to the Municipal Party Headquarters with the petition. At the same time, they petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau to request that the Special District Court issue a notice to all police stations not to arbitrarily interfere with orderly strike movements.</p>
<p>General Assembly Resolution: More than 300 striking workers held a general membership meeting at the union at 4:00 PM yesterday. Chairman Wang Ganchen reported on the strike situation throughout the city from various district investigation teams. They then discussed: (1) Receiving the instruction from the Municipal Party Headquarters and the People's Training Committee to convene both parties for mediation at 1:00 PM on the 21st (today) and designating four responsible representatives to attend the case; it was resolved to appoint Wang Ganchen, Cheng Tianfen, Jin Futian, and Cheng Zijun as representatives, and Hu Jinzhang and Li Fulin as observers. (2) The condition in Article 2 regarding a pay increase, the minimum limit that can be agreed upon for signing, should be discussed; it was resolved that the case should be handled by the signing representatives. (3) The entire set of conditions should be handled by the signing representatives with full authority without discussion; the resolution was passed. (4) It was proposed that all members of the union must gather at the union tomorrow without fail; the resolution was passed. (5) Due to the cold weather, winter clothes should be sent to the arrested comrades in the police station; it was resolved to hand the clothes to the manager of He Kang to send.</p>
<p>Condolences and Aid: Yesterday, representatives from the Soy Sauce Workers' Union, Weng Ruifu; the Postal Workers' Union, Liu Xinquan; the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, Fang Qingjian; the British American Tobacco Factory Workers' Union, Wang Ajin; the China Merchants Bureau No. 5 Wharf Workers' Union, Yu Xianting; the Sanitation Workers' Union, Jiang Qimin; the Ship Timber Workers' Union, Ye Xiangnie; the Rice and Grain Workers' Union, Sun ZhengGuo; the Silk and Cloth Dyeing Workers' Union, Zhu XiaoYun; all went to the pawn shop workers' union to offer condolences. All workers' unions in the city and each union issued a declaration of aid.</p>
<p>Management News</p>
<p>Report to the Authorities: The Pawn Shop Trade Association previously received instructions from the Municipal Party Headquarters, the People's Training Committee, and the Social Affairs Bureau to dispatch responsible representatives to the Party Headquarters on the 21st (today) to await mediation. Yesterday, a document was submitted to the People's Training Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that the association's members are divided into old and new, and due to different circumstances, the treatment of workers has not been consistent. For example, the agreement signed by labor and management on December 30, 1927, should be mutually observed, but when management earnestly implemented it, it was often rejected by workers, who often favored old practices. Therefore, various members of the association believe that the workers' union's request this time is still not thorough. Before the slowdown occurred, it was difficult for management to prepare in advance, and since responsible representatives had not been designated, they did not dare to rashly come forward and respond. Now, due to the previous instructions, a temporary emergency meeting of members was convened on the afternoon of the 18th. However, due to the suddenness of the event, only about 30 firms attended, and they all felt that the response to the workers' request could not be decided by a small number of firms. They had to reschedule a general assembly of all members on the afternoon of the 20th to jointly deliberate and then designate responsible representatives to follow the instructions of the Municipal Party Headquarters and the People's Training Committee to go there on the afternoon of the 21st with the Social Affairs Bureau to await mediation without delay. However, considering that the purpose of the pawn industry is to serve the people in addition to business, especially during the winter season, many poor households are waiting to redeem their clothes to keep warm and pawn miscellaneous items for food. If the slowdown continues and the business is suspended, it will not only be detrimental to both labor and management but also affect the livelihoods of the poor and the local security. Moreover, since the labor-management issue has been ordered to be mediated by the Council and the Social Affairs Bureau, we can wait quietly for the solution. The expression is unnecessary to resort to a slowdown. In addition to reporting the actual situation of the association for handling, we implore the Council to quickly issue an order to the workers' union to quickly resume work in order to maintain the livelihoods of the poor and the local security for public convenience. Sincerely submitted by the Pawn Shop Trade Association of Shanghai to the Municipal Party Headquarters of Shanghai and the Social Affairs Bureau of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Meeting: Members of the Trade Association decided to hold a membership meeting at the Lifeng Xiaoji on the half-floor of No. 6 Rongshou Lane, Beihai Road, at 1:00 PM yesterday. At around 3:00 PM, only a few members had arrived and were exchanging pleasantries. Suddenly, a burly northerner wearing a black robe and a black cloth around his head entered the building, claiming that his name was Xu Sanxing, that he had come to Shanghai from Guangdong, and that a few days ago, due to lack of funds, he had pawned his clothes at Yutai Pawn Shop east of the Little World. Now, he was going to Nanjing on business and needed to redeem his clothes to take to Nanjing, but the pawn shop was closed and he could not redeem them, so he had come to inquire. Then, Cheng Rufu, manager of Yutai Pawn Shop, issued a letter instructing him to redeem his clothes, and he retreated. At 4:10 PM, 52 members arrived and announced the opening of the meeting. Yu Shaoqing and Fang Minfu (on behalf of Cheng Rufu) were elected as chairmen to discuss the revised conditions proposed by the Workers' Union in great detail. Yu Langxi also reported on the revised content in order to present opinions when attending the Party Headquarters for mediation this afternoon. (Ri Ri News Agency)</p>

<h3>Assassination of Foreign Staff Member in Wusong</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhubielin of the Dredging Bureau</p>
<p>Shot Dead by Bandits at 7 PM Last Night</p>
<p>Mr. Zhubielin, a foreign staff member and the head of the northern machine shop of the engineering department of the Wusong Zhanghuabang Dredging Bureau, was shot and killed by bandits yesterday evening at 7 PM after leaving work at 5 PM to take the train to Shanghai. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Bandit Ambush: Mr. Zhu, accompanied by a Chinese shop worker named Jia, left the engineering department gate at 7 o'clock. Not dozens of steps away, near the back gate of the Hebo Si Yamen, the area was extremely deserted at night, so the bandits lurked by the roadside unnoticed. When Mr. Zhu approached, he was suddenly shot. The bullet hit a vital spot in the temple, and he fell to the ground and died. The shop worker, upon hearing the gunshot and seeing his master fall, was terrified and immediately fled back. The assailant, seeing that his goal had been achieved, fled in the chaos. The gatekeeper, Gong Xiaogou, saw the shop worker flee back and learned of the incident. The two went to report to Mr. Klaomo, the head of the southern construction department.</p>
<p>Death in the Street: Upon hearing the news, Mr. Ke went to the scene and saw Mr. Zhu's body wearing a white-gray coat, white woolen gloves, and black leather shoes. His clothes were neat, and he lay dead in the middle of the road with his head facing south and his feet facing north. Inspection revealed that the bullet entered the right temple and exited the left temple, with blood flowing all over the ground. The sight was unbearable. Mr. Ke checked his pockets and found a 5-yuan note from the Bank of China, 25 copper coins, a string of keys, and an empty envelope. There was nothing else. He then went to Shanghai to report to the General Bureau.</p>
<p>Background: Mr. Zhu was originally Russian but later became a French citizen. He was about 30 years old and unmarried. He was proficient in Chinese language and writing and could directly communicate with workers. He was dispatched from the Shanghai Bureau to the machine shop on July 1 of this year and had only been there for five months when he was suddenly killed. The reason is unknown.</p>
<p>Police Investigation: The chief of the first police station of the seventh district and members of the security corps rushed to investigate the scene and apprehend the perpetrator, but they were gone. The police chief rushed to report to Director Zhang Jiguang in Songhu. Director Zhang, along with detectives Yu Peifa and patrol officers, went to the scene to investigate the situation. They are currently searching for the culprit.</p>
<h3>Assassination of Wang Baozhan, Standing Committee Member of the Rickshaw Guild</h3>
<p>Shot by Assailants in the Lane</p>
<p>Critically Injured and Died</p>
<p>Family Speculates on the Reason for the Attack</p>
<p>Related to Rickshaw License Fees</p>
<p>Wang Baozhan, a native of Funing and a standing committee member of the Shanghai Rickshaw Trade Association, was shot by assailants in a lane while returning home from a bathhouse around 6:00 PM last night. The assailant escaped without a trace. He was rushed to the hospital by his family but died due to the severity of his injuries. There are several theories as to the reason for the killing, but the dispute over rickshaw license fees seems the most likely.</p>
<p>Returning Home After Bathing: Wang Baozhan, styled Qinzhai, was 55 years old, a native of Funing, and worked as a rickshaw puller. Before the Shanghai Rickshaw Trade Association was established, he served as the chairman of the Northern Shanghai Rickshaw Guild. After the merger of the north and south guilds last year, he was elected as a standing committee member of the Shanghai Rickshaw Trade Association. He lived at No. 1 Dexiang Lane, Hengfeng Road, Zhabei, not far from the guild's office on Datong Road, so he often walked back and forth. Around 6:00 PM last night, while returning home from the Huayang Chi Bathhouse at the intersection of 　Zhong　 Road, he was suddenly shot by an assailant lurking by the roadside at the entrance of Dexiang Lane. The assassin shot him from behind. Wang Baozhan turned to flee upon hearing the gunshot, but the assailant fired several more shots at his face, all hitting vital spots. At this time, Wang's family in the house heard the gunshots and were alarmed. They then heard someone knocking urgently on the door. Upon opening it, Wang Baozhan had 　staggered　 into the parlor, pointing to his chest with his left hand, which was covered in blood. He called out that he had been shot and pointed to his abdomen to indicate. When asked by his family who had shot him, Wang was incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Death from Injuries: Wang's family reported the incident to the second police station of the fourth district and requested the arrest of the assailant. They also rushed Wang Baozhan to Baolong Hospital on Baker Road for treatment. However, he died halfway due to the severity of his injuries. After arriving at the hospital, the doctor examined him and found three gunshot wounds: one on the left wrist, one below the navel, and another on the lower abdomen. The bullets had all passed through. According to eyewitnesses, the assailant was wearing a dark coat that was longer than his knees and a felt hat. He was about 23 or 24 years old. Before the attack, someone had handed Wang several copies of the resolution passed by the executive committee of the Rickshaw Guild outside the lane, wrapped in newspaper. When Wang was shot, he was still holding the newspaper in his hand, so the paper was stained with blood. However, the person who handed the package said that he did not see anyone lurking around when approaching the lane.</p>
<p>Reason for the Killing: According to Wang Baozhan's family, the killing was definitely the work of an enemy. As for why there was such a dire consequence, the dispute over rickshaw license fees seems the most likely reason. The deceased, Wang Baozhan, was outspoken and resourceful in the guild and was often elected as the guild's representative to negotiate with the Chinese and foreign rickshaw guilds in the concessions. Recently, the municipal government has ordered the Chinese and foreign rickshaw guilds in the concessions to join the Municipal Rickshaw Trade Association before April 1 of next year to ensure uniformity, otherwise the Chinese territory license will not be issued. It is said that Wang Baozhan had worked hard on this matter, which caused him to be resented by a few people, resulting in his death. Wang's son, named Xian Gu, is a lawyer and has reported the incident to the Public Security Bureau requesting the arrest of the assailant.</p>
<h3>Tongwen College</h3>
<p>School Servant Hanged Himself with Grievance</p>
<p>Served for Twenty-Eight Years</p>
<p>Highly Trusted by School Staff and Students</p>
<p>Took the Blame for Nephew's Loss of Huge Sum of Money</p>
<p>Unable to Find a Solution, Hanged Himself with Grievance</p>
<p>Li Hailin, a 42-year-old school servant from Hanyang, Hubei, at the Dongwen College on Hongqiao Road, was found hanged to death in the school yesterday morning. The Chinese students of the school suspect that Li committed suicide out of anger and resentment and have organized a support group to redress his grievances and find ways to help his family.</p>
<p>Taking the Blame for Nephew: Li Hailin has been serving as a school servant at Dongwen College for twenty-eight years. He is usually diligent and simple, and is trusted by the school authorities and students. He handles the delivery of letters, remittances, and purchases of miscellaneous items. Li has a nephew named Zhu Minggao, who is 21 years old. Li introduced him to the school to work as a servant. Whenever Li had to go out, Zhu would assist him in everything. One afternoon, at around 1:00 PM, Li Hailin drove a motorized bicycle to the post office and banks on North Sichuan Road to remit money. He received more than 1,350 yuan in banknotes, which he placed in the bicycle seat and entrusted to Zhu to guard. When he returned to school, the car passed by Tibet Road. Li got out of the car to buy a clothing box and instructed Zhu Minggao to pay attention to guarding the money. Who knew that Zhu was already gone when the business was finished and the money was completely lost. Li was shocked and hurried to look for him in various places, but found nothing. So he immediately returned to the school to inform the accountant, Kobayashi, who reported it to the police and the Japanese consulate to investigate Zhu's whereabouts. However, the school authorities blamed Li for the mistake, ordered him to find Zhu, and promised to find a way to raise money to compensate.</p>
<p>Sudden Suicide: After taking the blame for his nephew, Li's spirit was extremely distracted, and the school authorities suspected Li of conspiring in the matter and ordered a Japanese detective to interrogate Li. He was summoned to the accounting office the night before and interrogated in many ways. However, Li was not involved in the matter, so of course there was no way. The Japanese detective told him that he had to be taken to the police station tomorrow morning (yesterday morning) and handed over to his nephew. Li's fear increased. Yesterday morning, the school servants suddenly did not see Li Hailin. At first, they thought he had gone home, but his wife also said that he had not returned. They searched everywhere, but found nothing. It was not until around 11:00 AM that a son of a school worker discovered that Li had hanged himself in the car room. He had already died. The school reported to the police. However, Hongqiao Road is a cross-border construction. The sixth district and the second division of the Public Security Bureau sent the police to investigate the matter and ordered the school not to move the body to maintain police power.</p>
<p>A Family of Ten: Li Hailin married Zhu and has eight children. A family of ten all depend on Li alone. The eldest son, Peiyong, is 16 years old and is working and studying at Dongwen College. The second son, Peiyuan, is 13 years old and is studying at Hongqiao Road Primary School. The third son is ten years old, the fourth son is nine years old, the fifth and sixth are daughters, one is six years old and the other is four years old. The seventh son is three years old and the eighth son was born the day before yesterday. The Chinese students of the school Li Meng are very pitiful and his family is screaming in grief. Therefore, a support association has been organized to redress the grievances of the matter and to provide relief to his widow and orphans to comfort the dead.</p>
<h3>National New Year</h3>
<p>Still Prohibited from Setting Off Firecrackers</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Issues Orders to Subordinates to Comply</p>
<p>Setting off firecrackers is most likely to cause a fire and can easily cause misunderstandings. In order to maintain public order, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has repeatedly issued orders and notices to prohibit them. Now that the National New Year is approaching, the Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau are particularly concerned that people may set off firecrackers to celebrate the New Year, which will only waste money and be of no benefit to citizens. The Public Security Bureau has issued an order to its subordinates to continue to strictly prohibit them.</p>
<h3>Three Bandits Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>Jiang Haoyuan, Chang Miaquan, Chou Jinpu</p>
<p>Zhou Rangsan, a staff member of Meifu Foreign Company and a native of Yong, was kidnapped on the morning of August 27 at No. 1360 Hed Road, Shanghai West, when he left his house to go to work. He was rescued by the Jingansi Police Station, and one bandit, A Da, was killed on the spot. Five were captured and handed over to the Special District Local Court. Jiang Haoyuan, Yang Miaquan, and Chou Jinpu were all sentenced to death. Wang Aqing was sentenced to six years in prison. Zhang Xingbao was declared innocent after being questioned. The case was reported to the superiors for review. It is now approved that the three men of Jiang, Yang and Chou will be executed according to law to show sternness. The police station was notified to take the three criminals from the West Prison to the Special Court yesterday morning. Judge Cheng Shangfeng opened the court and declared that today was the day of execution and asked if there were any last words. Jiang confessed that he was 28 years old and from Tongzhou. He had already written a letter in prison this morning and asked the police detective Liu to hand it over to his relatives. He said that his death was not a pity and that he would avenge himself after death. When he was arrested, he had two double cents and 19 copper coins hidden in his body, which were stored in the police station. He requested that the money be used to buy long ingots to burn at the execution ground. There were also two pawn tickets, which he asked to be attached to the letter. Yang Miaquan confessed that he was 21 years old from Tongzhou and asked to inform his maternal uncle Chen Arong at the Huatong Electric Bulb Factory on Yulin Road and ask him to tell his father not to be sad, knowing that life and death are predetermined. He also instructed him to go to collect his body quickly. Chou was also from Tongzhou and only 26 years old. He confessed that he was harmed by Chen Heqing and requested to send a letter to Mao Daodao, a friend of his, at the Rixin Silk Factory, Panshijiaba South Bridge East, to tell his father-in-law, Chou Hongsheng, that he was a son-in-law and that although he had two children, his wife was still young and asked his father-in-law to recruit another son-in-law. After Judge Cheng questioned them, he ordered the detectives to escort the three criminals to the Caohejing Jiangsu Second Prison execution ground by car. Lei Renlong, a prosecutor appointed by the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate, was the supervising officer and ordered Police Chief Yang Deshan and Police Officer Chen Xihui to lead many execution police officers, including Gu Hanqing, Xue Bingzhang, and Xu Guoguang, to the execution ground. After the judge took the seat and questioned each criminal, the judge ordered the execution. Police Chief Yang commanded the execution police to take them down and execute them by firing squad. The bodies were collected by the court to wait for their families to claim them.</p>
<h3>Meeting on Dredging the Shentan</h3>
<p>Construction to Begin After Approval from the Ministry</p>
<p>The Dredging Bureau has received letters from British and British Chambers of Commerce and Chinese and foreign shipping companies stating that after dredging the Shentan outside Wusongkou, several meetings have been held and opinions have been solicited from Chinese and foreign shipping circles on fundraising.

<h3>French Tram Corrects Wording</h3>
<p>Supervised by the Public Utilities Bureau</p>
<p>Changed to French Commercial Tram</p>
<p>French commercial trams operating in the city temporarily cannot be stopped due to established cases. The Third, Fifth, and Sixth routes are the only ones with the words (French Concession Tram) marked on the outside of the carriages. The First District Party Department of this city believed that this would cause a bad impression on the citizens and submitted it to the Municipal Executive Committee, which sent a letter to the Municipal Government instructing them to change it to (French Commercial Tram) to avoid confusion. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau sent two letters to the French Electric Light and Tram Company urging them to make the correction, which has now been made uniformly. The bureau has also sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau and the district offices instructing the chief police officers to pay special attention to preventing any uncorrected trams from entering the city in order to emphasize the importance of the law.</p>

<h3>Appeals from Street Vendors on Minquan Road in the French Concession</h3>
<p>Street Vendor Association Asks General Supervisor Fei to Maintain</p>
<p>On Minquan Road in the French Concession, from Xiaobeimen to Dongxinqiao Street, there are various street vendors setting up stalls for business. Because there are illegal vendors setting up gambling stalls, gathering pedestrians, and obstructing traffic, the Four Ming Guild sent a letter to the French Concession Police to ban them. The police, after receiving the request, evicted all the vendors in the area, regardless of whether they were legitimate or not, and sent a patrolman to guard and ban all legitimate vendors from setting up stalls. As a result, about 70 vendors immediately lost their jobs. The French Concession Street Vendor Association has sent a letter to the Four Ming Guild to maintain the livelihoods of the street vendors. The guild has also sent a letter to the French Concession Police requesting that legitimate vendors be treated leniently and that the guild's directors, 　Qiaqing Jun, responded to the association stating that the guild would not interfere with legitimate vendors setting up stalls in front of the guild. The association has repeatedly requested the French Concession Police, but they still refuse to allow them to set up stalls. Therefore, the livelihoods of the vendors are very difficult to maintain. Yesterday, the association sent a letter to General Supervisor Fei asking him to maintain their livelihoods.</p>
<h3>Former Prostitute Zhaojun and Her Mother Settle a Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Already Sent a Telegram to Withdraw the Charges</p>
<p>Zhaojun, formerly a prostitute in the Qunyufang brothel on Shantou Road, was earlier redeemed and taken as a concubine by Yang Dinghou. Now, she is suddenly involved in a lawsuit with her mother, Song Shi, and the madam, Tang Wang Shi (also known as Wang Laoer), in the Special District Court. She changed her name to Song Xiangbao. According to her complaint, she was originally from Su-</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>-zhou and is twenty-two years old. Formerly, the two defendants forced her into a brothel in the year 16 of the Republic (1927). After being taken as a concubine by Yang Dinghou, their relationship was harmonious. This year, in February, the defendant, Song Shi, came and said she would take her to Suzhou for sightseeing, and she went with her. Unexpectedly, she was detained at the defendant Wang Laoer's place and forced to be a prostitute. Song Shi received 400 yuan as her body price. She was trapped in this pit. After being imprisoned, she lost her freedom. Subsequently, she was lured to Hanyi, Chongqing, and other places, forced to receive customers, otherwise she would be whipped. Around August, she was brought back to Shanghai, living at 433 Yixin Lane, still engaging in prostitution, resulting in her being infected with syphilis, causing her great suffering. Fortunately, she escaped the tiger's den and is temporarily staying with relatives. The defendants still dare to harass her from time to time, so she specifically filed a lawsuit, requesting that they be punished according to the law, and prohibiting them from infringing on the plaintiff's freedom again, etc. After her mother and others were accused, fearing they would be condemned, they asked someone to mediate, promising not to interfere with the plaintiff's freedom again. Zhaojun also did not go too far. Yesterday, her attorney, Lin Hanqing, applied to the Special Court to withdraw the charges.</p>
<h3>A Favorite Concubine Abuses the Wife, Who Attempts Suicide by Drowning</h3>
<p>Ye Jincheng is Devoid of Compassion</p>
<p>Ye Jincheng, 42 years old, from Anhui Province, resides at the east end of the railway north of Fanwangdubang in western Shanghai. He works as a foreman in a factory and has accumulated some savings, making him somewhat well-off. His wife, Wu Shi, is the same age. However, Wu Shi has not yet had any children, and her lap remains empty. Because Ye was eager to have a son, he took Zhang A'da, a woman from Yangzhou, as a concubine this spring, introduced by a friend. After she entered the house, they lived together. The relationship between the wife and concubine was like fire and water, but the wife, Wu Shi, was naturally weak and had to endure in silence. The concubine, however, was only twenty-four years old, of fair appearance, and of fierce temperament, so Ye doted on her greatly and oppressed his original wife severely. Recently, Wu Shi, unable to bear it any longer, quarreled with the concubine constantly. Around 8 p.m. the day before yesterday, Ye was having dinner with the concubine when, for some reason, a fierce argument suddenly broke out again. Relying on her husband's power, the concubine immediately stepped forward and beat Wu Shi. Unexpectedly, her husband not only did not stop her but helped the concubine beat Wu Shi severely. Overwhelmed with grief and indignation, Wu Shi secretly slipped out the back door and jumped into a small creek to commit suicide. Fortunately, a neighbor saw her, braved the rain, and rushed to rescue her. She was drenched and had swallowed a lot of water. She was resuscitated and fortunately survived.</p>

<h3>Continued Report on the Strike of Employees in Liquor Stores</h3>
<p>The Situation is More Tense Than Before</p>

<h3>The American Cigarette Company</h3>
<p>The Labor Dispute Mediation Fails</p>
<p>The American Cigarette Company on Yulin Road in this city dismissed over 200 workers, including Ye Fengzhu and Zheng Xuezhen, who joined the strike. The dismissed workers went to party and government agencies to petition.

<h3>The Shanghai Branch of the National Railway Association is Established</h3>

<h3>Time for Government Employees to Undergo Opium Addiction Checks</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Issues Instructions for All Agencies to Comply With</p>
<p>The municipal government yesterday issued instructions to the bureaus and investigation committees, saying: For the purpose of knowing the facts of the case, the approval of the Tobacco Prohibition Committee's consultation is hereby announced. The rules for the opium addiction checks of government employees have already been announced, but there are no clear provisions regarding the time limit in the rules. Repeated inquiries have been received from various provincial governments that if opium addicts are reported or accused and receive a notice to undergo a check, they deliberately delay the time for rehabilitation, which can easily obscure the facts and lose the original intention of legal punishment. Therefore, based on the above meaning, a proposal was prepared and submitted to the 60th and 64th committee meetings for discussion and resolution. It was resolved that the regulations for the implementation of tobacco prohibition stipulate that local authorities may establish addiction check centers, then civil servants in all provinces should undergo addiction checks nearby, and a notice should be sent to the governments of all provinces, instructing them to inform all those who are checked that those who fail to comply within three days of receiving the notice will be deemed to be addicts. When it is necessary to check officers of the army, navy, and air force agencies and civil servants of overseas embassies, the relevant chiefs may be responsible for designating doctors nearby in accordance with the aforementioned time limit. In addition to the separate consultation, a corresponding consultation is requested for verification and notification of compliance, etc. In addition to separate orders, this order is hereby issued, instructing the bureau to be informed for compliance with this order.</p>
<h3>Map of Products Published by the Bureau of Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>The Bureau of Industry and Commerce is a visiting and investigating agency established by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in Shanghai. In addition to publishing the Chinese Industry and Commerce Bi-Monthly and English Weekly and Monthly on a regular basis, it also pays attention to field investigations and has made many contributions. Recently, the bureau has also compiled and printed a map of Chinese products based on field investigations, listing the special products of various places, whether handicrafts or agricultural products, to make it clear to viewers the distribution of products in China, which is an unprecedented industrial map and is of great value. It is appropriate for those who study agriculture, industry, and commerce to have a copy in hand. It is said that the price is three dollars per copy, and those who subscribe to the bureau's publications within the year will receive a copy as a gift, with students receiving a half-price discount, which is available from the publishing stock of the bureau on the fourth floor of the Jianghai Customs Building on Hankou Road and the Commercial Press.</p>
<h3>No Need to Detain Ships in Collisions</h3>
<p>The Responsibility is Borne by the Company</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received instructions from the Civil Affairs Department yesterday, saying: For the matter of notification, it is announced that the provincial government's instructions are approved. According to the Zhenjiang Shipping Association's report, the Zhenjiang Shipping Workers' Union stated that all members of the union reported that in the Huai River, whenever a passenger accidentally falls into the water and dies, the water authorities would detain the crew members regardless of the reason and subject them to all kinds of illegal treatment, requesting maintenance, etc. After deliberation, it was decided to send a letter to the Shipping Association to jointly plan a guarantee method, etc. During the performance of their duties, all the actions of the crew members are the actions of the company as a legal entity, not the actions of the individuals themselves. Even in the event of a collision, before the right and wrong are determined according to the navigation rules, the county governments arbitrarily detain the ships and retain the crew members pointed out as defendants to show intimidation, which hinders the peace and order of the passengers, and the company suffers great losses, which is not based on the law, nor is it fair in principle. Moreover, the company is a private legal entity and there is no risk of escape. The suspected crime is only due to negligence or dereliction of duty by the crew members, which is very different from intentional crimes. There is no need to detain the ships and crew members. It is often seen that in large cities, when a car accident occurs, the police only record the car number and allow it to drive away before taking appropriate legal action. Why can't the same be done for ship collisions, recording the company and ship name and allowing them to temporarily transport other passengers? Cars and ships are both transportation businesses, but the treatment by government agencies is different. The Department of Transportation requested the Department of Transportation to inform all local authorities that in the future, except for major cases in which the current offender poses a risk of escape and is difficult to capture without immediate arrest, in the event of a collision, if the company can be held responsible, please do not arbitrarily detain them in order to protect the law and protect human rights, etc. In accordance with the notification, the County Government and the Water and Land Public Security Bureau have been instructed to comply with the procedures in this order, the County Chief has been instructed to comply with the above.</p>

<h3>Remembering Mr. Sun Jingseng Chunmeng</h3>
<p>Mr. Sun Jingseng of Wujiang was my respected teacher. He taught at Minli Middle School for more than twenty years.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun was knowledgeable and had a strong memory. His personality was especially gentle and approachable. All alumni of Minli respected and admired Mr. Sun. As a teacher, he was authoritative but not harsh. His teaching, even in the smallest word or action, could transform people through virtue. I remember one hot summer evening after class, some students moved their seats to the playground to enjoy the cool air. The moon was bright, and the young students, being playful, stacked chairs and benches to make a jumping game. After the group dispersed, they left the benches and chairs in disarray. Mr. Sun, upon seeing this, did not</p>
<p>scold them but personally moved everything back to its original place. Later, those who had been jumping heard of this and felt deeply ashamed, saying to each other, "We were undisciplined and caused Mr. Sun so much trouble." After this, on days when Mr. Sun was on duty, they would diligently restrain themselves. Mr. Sun, though approaching old age, was diligent in his studies and never tired, always fearing to lag behind. His work and rest were always scheduled. Every morning he would rise and practice calligraphy in large characters. During breaks, he would browse private collections. In the evening, he would study elementary texts carefully, researching and investigating until midnight before stopping. When I lived at the school, my room was close to Mr. Sun's. Every dawn when I woke up, I would hear the sound of grinding ink and occasional coughing from the neighboring room, indicating that Mr. Sun had already risen and was practicing calligraphy. This was his routine year after year. In the year Yichou, when Mr. Sun turned sixty, he instructed his sons in advance not to follow worldly customs and hold a celebratory banquet. On his birthday, he drafted several self-congratulatory poems and changed his name to "Wuwun." Some said that Mr. Sun was being self-deprecating. I believe that the phrase "at forty or fifty, one is unheard of" in the Analects is merely Confucius encouraging future generations. Could someone as broad-minded as Mr. Sun truly care about being heard of or not? In the past, when the Zhou dynasty declined, gentlemen sang about the rabbit and the monkey, wanting to avoid being awakened. Mr. Sun, witnessing the changes of the times, was likely also moved by this. I have been away from Mr. Sun for five years. I often think of my teacher and feel deeply nostalgic. Recently, I read Mr. Sun's memorial inscription for Mr. Su and could vividly picture Mr. Sun with his graying beard and hair, pacing back and forth under the long corridor in the school, holding a scroll and reciting with feeling. Mr. Sun was skilled in poetry and classical prose. His poetic style was close to that of Bai Juyi. His prose followed the Tongcheng school, being smooth and subtle, capturing its tranquil and distant essence.</p>
<p>Mei Lian Guo</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang's stage appearances in Shanghai were met with many gifts of couplets. Phrases like "Orchid fragrance permeates nine acres, news spreads beyond China," and "Doctor of foreign literature, king of the Chinese acting world," were clever and beautiful. However, one couplet, with only eight characters, was subtly meaningful, classic, and precise. Mei Lanfang passed it on, indicating its special merit. What were those eight characters? "Zhendan Wenxue (Alas, My King)." The giver was the horn player Tao Jia Yao, and the author was the writer Tao Zaidong.</p>
<p>From Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>During the day, there is the warmth to enjoy, no less than wearing a sable coat. At night, there is wine to pour, better than leaning on beauties.</p>
<p>Barbers possess skill above the neck, but are not valued by society.</p>
<p>Shanghai trams have first class and third class, but no second class, highlighting the prominence of the first class.</p>
<p>Stage scenery in movies often only has one side that can be viewed straight on, not from the side. In reality, many things in society are like this and cannot be seen through.</p>
<p>A single folding screen hides much romantic longing.</p>
<p>A lamp, a quilt, a soup, a jar, and a book – this is my only solace on cold nights.</p>
<p>Eating too much candy can damage teeth, so rather than sharing sweetness with others, I prefer to endure bitterness myself.</p>
<p>Someone who enjoys reading the small articles attached to newspapers is definitely not boorish.</p>
<p>To befriend the ancients and associate with contemporary talents – only then can one be worthy of the title "socialite."</p>
<p>The blush on a beauty's face is the only color in the realm of love.</p>
<p>Observe the world with a cool head and read books with an open mind.</p>
<p>Speaking about one's profession at every turn is a major taboo for someone away from home.</p>
<p>Do not walk the path of extremes; leave room for future connections.</p>
<p>By looking at the furnishings, calligraphy, and paintings in someone's house, one can know whether they are refined or vulgar.</p>
<p>In the past, having money made one bold; now, having money makes one timid.</p>
<p>If you absentmindedly mail a letter without sticking a stamp, the anxiety is indescribable.</p>
<p>It's easy to seek the form, but difficult to seek the spirit. Therefore, China's Westernization is merely about form, not spirit.</p>

<p>Everyone knows the harm rats cause. Spreading plague and contaminating food are not limited to gnawing on clothes and destroying objects. Hygienists consider rats to be humanity's greatest enemy and try various methods to exterminate them. However, rats reproduce extremely quickly. Their extermination is endless. The British government has an annual Anti-Rat Week, during which the entire nation rises up and fiercely battles rats, hoping to raise public awareness and eradicate rats from human society as soon as possible. This method is excellent.</p>
<p>Equal Strength. The annual Anti-Rat Week began on November 10th this year. At that time, pharmacies and private clinics across the country did their best to display various rat poisons and rat-catching tools for public viewing. Enthusiastic people in various places even gathered comrades to declare war on rats or organized lecture teams to go to remote rural areas to promote rat resistance. Rat-catching experts from various places printed booklets with various rat-catching methods and distributed them to various places for selection. For a time, the whole country was stirred up, and the rats shivered in fear, feeling as if they could not live another day. However, rats are cunning and can foresee disasters. Although the attacks inflicted on them by humans are fierce, their offspring continue to multiply endlessly. According to experts, there are 40 million people in the UK and Wales, and the number of rats in the UK is about the same. With forces so evenly matched, it is difficult to determine the outcome of the battle.</p>
<p>Specially Killing Females. There are about two ways to resist rats: live capture and poisoning. Live capture mostly uses cages, traps, and sweet bait to lure them in and then kill them. Poisoning mostly uses various poisons mixed into cakes and bait so that they swallow them in one bite, and the poison takes effect in their stomachs, making it impossible to save them. Recently, there have even been those who use (poisonous gas) to attack rats. Once used in a room, rats can be wiped out in one fell swoop. However, poisoning can kill people. People cannot get close after application. This is a problem. Rat-catching experts in the UK say that if you want to exterminate rats, you must use the (Rodin) method. What is the Rodin method? It is the latest rat-catching method. The inventor's name is Rodin, hence the name. Those who use this method only kill female rats and not males. Since the battle line is narrower, success is easier. Females are the source of reproduction. Once the females are killed, the males will naturally be difficult to survive for long. It's a good method. There is one more thing to add: rats are good at traveling. To find food or escape, they can travel up to 150 miles. Therefore, the method of catching rats is to have simultaneous operations in various places, with nets densely spread and no gaps to escape. The extermination of rats is almost certain.</p>
<h3>Travelogue of Southeast Asia (106)</h3>
<p>Burmese monks are very knowledgeable and often say to me: "Our Burma will inevitably suffer the catastrophe of communism in the future." I asked him the reason. He replied: "China and India both have communist parties, and the killing machine is spreading. Burma is located between China and India and will inevitably be affected sooner or later." However, we do not think so. We believe that Siam and Burma are both Buddhist countries. Although they will suffer the catastrophe of communism, their people are kind and will suffer less.</p>
<p>The roads in Mandalay are flat, straight and wide, quite like Beijing. The houses are fresh and new, like Nanjing. However, the land is dry and dusty. There is a good method in Burmese cities that can be learned. Street layouts often use numbers. Mandalay's street names, both vertical and horizontal, are mostly numbers from one to one hundred. The Chinese streets in Rangoon are also like this, but streets that are not Chinese do not use this name. I think using numbers to name streets is a very good method. In ancient China, the method of craftsmen governing the country in the Rites of Zhou first involved dividing longitude and latitude. Those that can be examined now, such as the city of Qufu, although small, have clear longitude and latitude in the north, south, east and west. The new Shandong concession also uses longitude and latitude to name its streets, which is very convenient for searching. Now the street names in various cities are messy and directionless. How can they compare to our ancient system?</p>
<p>On the 15th, introduced by Xie Dunming, I visited Burmese person RYAWHLAO. He is also the secretary of the Mandalay Evangelical Association. He read my English letter and liked it very much. I also visited Burmese person Ge Ba. The stone industry in Mandalay is quite developed, but the business of judging stones is very difficult to describe. It can lead to wealth in the long run or poverty in the short run, but in the end, there are more who become rich. I saw a gray stone and asked about it. I was told that it was worth tens of thousands. It is said that emeralds are valued for their luster. The most expensive stones are ten times the price of gold. However, I heard that production has not been good in recent years, and the import tax from China has increased. Jade merchants are also complaining. However, the Chinese merchants have to transport the stones to Shanghai to make various utensils and then sell them to Europeans in Shanghai. I wonder why they don't sell them directly to Europe and save on import taxes, export taxes, and the involvement of foreigners. Mostly, Chinese people only know the Shanghai market and lack knowledge of the European and American markets. Also, because the local workers are clumsy, they have to be made in Shanghai factories because the Shanghai workers are clever. But I think it is better to move the workers here and save a lot of expenses.</p>
<h3>Remembering My Three Friends in Hangzhou in the Cold Season by Huang Lu</h3>
<p>Are you all well, pine, bamboo, and plum?</p>
<p>The weather is cold, and frost has settled; the year is coming to an end. I sigh at how quickly time passes and feel that my age is increasing in vain. In recent years, I have often been driven by food and clothing to travel north and south, and my body is like duckweed. Recently, I resigned from my reporting job in Hangzhou and came to Shanghai again. Although I am in the business world, I still cannot escape a writing life. In this time of severe frost, I cannot help but miss my three friends in Hangzhou. The three friends are the pines of Song's tomb road, the bamboo of Taoguang, and the plum blossoms of Gushan. Having more free time in my rented room, I picked up my pen to record this. If the three gentlemen knew, would they laugh at my foolish infatuation?</p>
<p>Song's tomb road is located behind Lingyin Temple, covering dozens of acres. There are more than a hundred levels of steps. The sides are planted with sparse pine trees, some gnarled and old like dragons, suitable for cranes to perch on, and some green and graceful, as tall as the clouds. Being in this place, quietly listening to the sound of the wind through the pines, echoing with the sound of the spring in the mountain stream, like the waves of a thousand acres, like the galloping of ten thousand horses, both majestic and grand, both elegant and secluded. I have lingered here for a long time, sighing, "If I could build a hut here in life and a tomb here in death, I would have no regrets for the rest of my life." But this wish will eventually become a dream.</p>
<p>From Lingyin to Taoguang, there are thousands of steps, with lush forests of bamboo on both sides. Those that are tall can be dozens of feet, and those that are short are also more than ten feet. The thick ones are like buckets, and the thin ones are like arms. From the foot of the mountain to the top, the total number should be in the tens of thousands. It cannot be said that it is not a grand sight. It is rumored that the bamboo for making Tianzhu chopsticks is taken from here, but in reality, it is not. Many visitors to Hangzhou like to carve their names on the bamboo stalks to leave a memento. An ancient poem says, "Thousands and thousands of bamboo stalks, only one or two plum blossoms." It can be believed that bamboo is best when in clusters and plum blossoms are best when sparse. Observing the seclusion of the Taoguang bamboo path further confirms this.</p>
<p>The plum blossoms of Gushan have been passed down for hundreds of years and are famous throughout the country. But in reality, they are sparse and not enough to be considered a grand sight. Hangzhou has many famous plum blossoms. For uniqueness and antiquity, the Tang plum and Song plum of Chaoshan are the best. For seclusion and elegance, the red plum and green calyx plum of Lingfeng are the best. The plum blossoms of Gushan are famous thanks to the talent of Lin Bu. Although the plum blossom is a noble recluse, it can only show its purity and integrity if it grows in a secluded valley and is not close to the world. The plum blossoms of Gushan, having no gardener to care for them and suffering the destruction of vulgar people, how can they not rot with other plants and trees?</p>
<h3>Warmth on My Mind (339) by Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Episode 16: Courteously Asking for Words, Cuixiu Visits the Teacher; Generously Discussing Military Affairs, Famous Courtesans Banquet Female Heroes. In the end, is it Three Fives or Five Passes that are impassable? The third hand has already passed three passes, but these two passes cannot be passed no matter what. There is also a saying for playing Five Passes, called "Three Passes are easy, Two Passes are difficult." Luyi pushed the dominoes, pouted her cherry lips and said she wasn't playing anymore. Zuo Shichen smiled and said, "Let's play word association instead. This Five Passes game seems very mysterious. Sometimes you can pass it in one hand, and sometimes you can't pass it even if you play dozens of hands. You only know how to play Five Passes, but do you know the story behind Five Passes?" Luyi said, "Is there a story behind Five Passes?" Zuo Shichen said, "This is from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Cao Cao kept Guan Gong and wouldn't let him leave. He wanted to find his master Liu Bei, so he left Cao Cao's place, but he had to pass through five passes. The guards at the passes wouldn't let him pass without Cao Cao's orders. But Guan Gong relied on his martial prowess to seize the passes and leave. He passed through five passes and killed six of the guards before he could escape. This is called 'Five Passes, Slaying Six Generals.' Isn't there a method of slaying six generals in playing Five Passes?" Luyi said, "Then Cao Cao could have just not let Guan Gong leave, so why bother instructing the guards to stop him?" Zuo Shi said, "That's why Cao Cao is called a cunning hero. He used the method of pretending to let go in order to catch, and using someone else to kill. People say that Cao Cao treated Guan Gong so well, but when he left, he lost six generals, as if Guan Gong was being unreasonable." Luyi listened somewhat blankly and asked, "Is this all from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms?" Zuo Shichen said, "Of course. Fortunately, the guards Guan Gong encountered at the five passes were all incompetent. If there were one or two who were more skilled in martial arts than Guan Gong, then Guan Gong would be like you today." Luyi said, "How am I like you today?" Zuo Shichen smiled and said, "Like you, you can't pass the five passes today." Luyi said, "Comparing me to Guan Gong is a sin. It's a pity I can't read. If I could read and look at that novel, I could relieve my boredom." Zuo Shichen said, "Why don't you study? There are many ladies in their twenties and thirties who go to girls' schools. You're only sixteen this year, it's the perfect time to study." Her mother said, "Our girl did go to a school when she was thirteen. The teacher liked her very much, but she got sick and didn't go anymore. She only went to school for three months and read two textbooks. I'm afraid she's already returned them to the teacher." Zuo Shichen said, "Actually, you can study now. No matter what, it's always in your own interest to know more characters." Luyi sighed softly and said, "When I was at A Su's place, many guests also advised me to study, but someone who has eaten in a brothel is like a piece of pure white silk falling into a vat of dye."</p>
<p>"What's the point of studying anymore?"</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Markets Have Different Supply and Demand</h3>
<p>There was a Weak Rebound. Yesterday, December 20th, the surge in gold prices stopped slightly, but the trend of large increases and small corrections was still difficult to quell. The chaotic situation continued. In the morning, the bullish momentum ended and reversed, nearly ten taels difference was observed. People's hearts were hesitant. As for trading in the market, supply and demand varied. Fuxingchang, Yuanheng, Zhifeng, Yongda, Decheng, and others mostly bought in, while Yongfeng, Yuanmao, Yongji, and the Dalian gang had mixed transactions. The overseas silver market reported gains, and the exchange rates followed, increasing by one level, but the domestic market was slightly calmer. The gold market opened lower and once broke the sixty tael mark. Fortunately, the intentions of the fellow traders were stable, and buying interest reappeared. However, the fluctuations of three or four taels were difficult to suppress. Around noon, a sudden surge occurred, soaring to 69 taels. However, the exchange rates faltered. Large households sold off, causing a rapid downturn, finally settling within 62 taels. The volatile situation was difficult to predict. This morning, large lots may rise again. Because it was Saturday, the market was closed as usual in the afternoon.</p>
<p>In a Chaotic State. From the opening of the market for February delivery at 662 taels 2 mace, a decrease of 1 tael 1 mace (the gross market price fell from 61.2 taels to slightly over 4 mace, with sellers not hesitating and then falling to 2 mace), large lots generally rose by one-eighth, and the silver price increased by three-eighths. The private telegraph rates were also the same. Yongfeng Zhifeng Yong initially sold off, so the price fell again to 61 taels. Yuanmao Yong Yuanheng Wupin and others bought in, and the price instantly rose to 64 taels. But Yongfeng Bingxing Wupin and others again sold off, suddenly breaking the 60 tael mark and plummeting to 59 taels 8 mace. The British gold price also showed signs of weakness. Maccari Zhengjin and others bought March deliveries at 15375, and January deliveries could be settled at 3125. After this, Zhifeng Yong and retail buyers bought in and raised the price by 3 shillings. The exchange rate was announced at 62 taels 7 or 8 mace, but the listed price had already increased by $0.25 to $0.50. The Japanese gold price fell by 1.75 points, but it was not affected. Because Fuchang and others were actively buying, the price rose to 65 taels 3 mace. Before long, Wanxing Shunli and hedgers came to sell off. In addition, the British gold banks were mutually trading March deliveries at 153125. Around 10 o'clock, the price fell to 61 taels 4 mace. Afterwards, Zhengjin absorbed March deliveries at 153125, and Mitsui absorbed the current Dalian large lots at 4 mace 1.5 points. On the trading floor, Yuanmao Yong Zhifeng Yong Fuchang Yuanheng Decheng and others collectively rushed to buy, and the market situation immediately became sharp, rising in stages and increasing by a huge amount of 7 or 8 taels. Zhengjin absorbed March British gold deliveries at 151875. By 11 o'clock, the price had actually reached 69 taels 3 mace, falling by 1 tael 9 mace. In an instant, the waves were overwhelming. Yongfeng Hengyu Yu Dayuanmao Yong and others tended to sell off, and the price plummeted. In half an hour, it tragically fell by 7 taels. At 11:45, the price was 62 taels 5 or 6 mace. Because the recent trading range for British gold was 1525, there were quickly buyers who added 1 tael to the price, making it 3 taels 7 or 8 mace. However, the morale was low. Richang Decheng Taikang Runyu Feng Yong Yuancheng Yong and others all had sell-offs, causing the price to depreciate by more than 2 taels, totaling 61 taels 2 mace. At the noon closing, the price was 61 taels 4 mace, slightly lower than the previous day by 1 tael 9 mace, which was a reversal of the consecutive three-day rise of 11 taels. After the market closed, trading continued at 2 mace. Tong Taichang bought in. The highest price during the half-day was 69 taels 3 mace, and the lowest price was 59 taels 8 mace, a difference of 9 taels 5 mace. Looking back, the initial opening price of goods was 2 taels 6 mace, and the noon closing price was 2 taels. The announced price had been changed to 691 taels 8 mace. The Japanese gold price was reduced by a small amount of 1.75 points, initially pressing down 29 taels, then 23 taels. The final result was over 30 taels. Registered accounts were between 58 taels and 60 taels, with a supplementary payment of 58 taels. Silver and gold jewelry were exchanged at 92.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Many Confused Transactions. Trader transactions include Yuanheng Fuchang Decheng Jiuda Yuanda Zhifeng Yong Yuanxing Yong all buying in, and Hengyu Changsheng Yong Shunli Yu Tai Wanxing Yongfeng and others having frequent ins and outs. Yuanmao Yong and Wupin had very frequent ins and outs. Taikang Run Hengxing Yufeng Yong Richang Yuancheng and others also sold off later. The Dalian gang sold off more than 1,000 lots, while buying in more than 800 lots. The Guangdong gang sold off a little, it is said.</p>
<h3>Unpredictable Foreign Exchange Market</h3>
<p>Chinese Merchants Had Both Inflows and Outflows</p>
<p>Large Lots Had an Upward Trend</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British and American silver markets saw gains again. The British-American exchange rate fell, while the Japanese-American exchange rate rose. Yokohama and Kobe had no gains or losses. As for the HSBC listed foreign exchange rates, they were increased by one level. The British gold price increased by 0.25, to 1 shilling 5 pence 0.125. The American gold price increased by 0.5 yuan, to 34.625 yuan. The Indian exchange rate increased by 0.01625, to 96 rupees. The French exchange rate was 13 yuan, to 882 yuan.

The Japanese gold price fell by 1.75 points, to 1 tael 4 mace 3.5 points. However, the bank's domestic market slightly rebounded, initially stable, then weakened, then stabilized, and finally loosened. The surge in the gold market had initially subsided, but the storms were still strong, so the difference in the price during the half day was 9.5 taels. The changes in the market situation were still difficult to stop. This was a large increase followed by a small correction. By noon, the results of the various exchange rates compared to the previous day showed that both the British and American exchange rates had no gains or losses, only the Japanese gold price decreased by 0.25. Chinese merchants had both inflows and outflows. Guangdong Bang Shen Da had brokered tens of thousands of pounds of British gold, and various firms had also settled with banks such as Mitsui, Hua Yi, Sumitomo, and Hua Bi. However, Maccari Zhengjin also absorbed about 300,000 pounds, and various banks mutually traded several tens of thousands of pounds. The appetite of Zhengjin was not weak. However, only a small amount of Japanese gold was sold off, absorbed by Mitsui. The American gold price was fresh. Transactions were rare. Because it was Saturday afternoon, there was no market. As for large lots, the Shanghai market was seen or expected to rise, it is said.</p>
<p>The domestic market for British exchange rates had an increase of 0.1875. In the early market, the near-term and far-term prices were 1 shilling 5 pence 0.125 for buying and 0.3125 for selling. There was no change at the closing.</p>
<p>The domestic market for American exchange rates had a fluctuation of 0.375. Trading occurred intermittently in the morning. The near-term price was 34.9375 yuan for buying and 35.0625 yuan for selling. The noon closing was similar.</p>
<p>The domestic market for East Asian exchange rates had a difference of 0.5 points.

The buying price was reduced by 0.5 points. Mitsui bought 100,000 yuan of current money at 1 tael 4 mace 1 point 0.5. At the noon closing, the price for this month was 1 tael 4 mace 2 points, the price for January was 1 point 875, and the price for March was 1 point 75. The buying price was reduced by a small amount of 0.75 points, it is said.</p>
<h3>Silver Market Changed and Rose Again</h3>
<p>According to the London telegraph, the large lot was fluctuating and uncertain. The trend rose again. The recent price increased by 0.125, to 14 shillings 6.25 points (equivalent to 1 shilling 5 pence 0.25 for British gold). The far-term price also increased by 0.125, to 4 shillings 6.875 points. The trade in locally produced goods was scarce, and the market was calm. After the closing, because there was little activity in the United States, the market was sluggish. Furthermore, the New York telegraph reported that the American silver price also rose by 0.375, to $0.31625 for the spot price. The British exchange rate against the American exchange rate decreased by 0.0625, to $4.853221. The American exchange rate against the British exchange rate fell by 0.03125, to $4.856875. The Japanese-American exchange rate increased by 0.0625, to 49.875 yuan. The British-Japanese exchange rate remained at 2 shillings 0.1732. The London-Shanghai exchange rate remained unchanged, at 1 shilling 5 pence. The Bombay spot price had no telegraph after it closed and did not change.</p>
<h3>Weekend Interest Rates and Discounts Were Uniformly Relaxed</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the usual Saturday, and banks closed in the afternoon as usual. However, that day happened to be the period of the year-end comparison, and normally, the collections and settlements would be very tight. But because the banks were closed in the afternoon, most of the large transactions could not be signed. Normally, they would have to wait until next week to be processed. Therefore, the bank collections and settlements could not be investigated in detail yesterday. As for the interest rates and discounts, the early market was still 7 mace 2 fen 4 li 0.5 hao. The noon market was slightly lower by 0.1 hao 0.2 hu, to 7 mace 2 fen 4 li 0.3 hao 0.7 hu. In the early market, 1,185,000 yuan of remittances were made, and 115,000 yuan of banknotes were transacted in the noon market. In the early market, 5,000 yuan of banknotes were transacted, and 11,500 yuan of banknotes were transacted in the noon market. In the over-the-counter banknote market, 122,000 yuan were transacted in the early market, and 60,000 yuan were transacted in the noon market. In the bank transaction market, 500,000 yuan were transacted in the early market, and 350,000 yuan were transacted in the noon market. The overnight loan rate was 2 points in the early market, and it was actually available for borrowing in the noon market, which showed that the money supply was loose. The receipts and disbursements for both the money shops' silver and foreign currency public orders were also too numerous, and due to time constraints, we could not report in detail. The small money shops transacted over 500,000 yuan. In the Jiangnan small foreign currency market, the price was 6 mace 5 fen 3 li in the early market, and the price was the same in the noon market. Only 2,000 jiao were transacted in the early market. In the Guangdong small foreign currency market, the price was 6 mace 5 fen 6 li in both the early and noon markets. 85,000 jiao were transacted in the early market, and 20,000 jiao were transacted in the noon market. The steel yuan slightly increased by 500 wen, to 373,000 wen.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Slightly Better by a Few Points</h3>
<p>Minimal Fluctuations, Sluggish Market Conditions</p>
<p>Yesterday's government bond market was extremely quiet. Throughout the day, only the 1929 bonds traded, reaching 19. The futures market was even more sluggish than before, with only 1.6 to 1.7 million yuan traded in each session, totaling only 3.345 million yuan for the entire day. Of this, the 1929 bonds accounted for 1.165 million yuan, demobilization bonds approximately 700,000 yuan, and the 1926 reorganization and the 1924 reconstruction bonds only 300,000 to 400,000 yuan each. The demand for various bonds yesterday was very balanced, with prices remaining stable. Although there was a slight overall rebound compared to the previous day, the increase was minimal.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Starts Calm, Ends Strong</h3>
<p>Yarn Market: Calm in the Morning, Strong in the Afternoon. Recently, the market has been quite volatile and uncertain. This is mainly because general retail investors have a stronger bullish sentiment due to year-end considerations, coupled with concerns about the factory tax. However, inventory is still high, and yarn demand is not smooth. Due to tight credit conditions at year-end, purchasing power may not last long. Additionally, the global situation is weak, so Japanese merchants are maintaining a calm stance, and the Chaozhou merchants are also remaining unmoved. In summary, adjustments must be made based on actual sales.</p>
<p>"Ren Biao" Good for Five to Six Points; "Ren Biao" Opens Calmly in the Morning Due to Flat American Cotton.</p>
<p>Weak Current Yarn Sales, Soft Sentiment, the Style in the Market is Increasingly Strong, with Each Down Two, Three, Four, Five, Six Points. In the Afternoon, Although Physical Demand is Weak, There is Talk of American Cotton Maintaining Its Value, Boosting Morale, with Each Up Eight, Nine Points to One or Two Points. Total Transactions for the Day are Estimated at 20,700 Bales. The Sales Records Show that Mao Ji Sold 1,400 Bales, Mao Ji 950 Bales, Gong 950 Bales, Da Feng 850 Bales, Yi Yu 800 Bales, and the Rest 5, 6, 700 Bales.

<h3>Cotton Market: Weak in the Morning, Strong in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The cotton market was reported to be weak in the morning but strong in the afternoon. However, the condition of American cotton was flat, so sentiment softened, and bullish investors tended to unwind their positions. Current cotton sales were sluggish, and factories had no demand, so there was some decline. However, the amount of raw cotton in Hankou is gradually increasing, making the cotton market situation unusually complex.</p>
<p>"Han Biao" Up 2.5 Points: "Han Jin" opened in the morning with flat and weak American cotton, and morale was gloomy, down 1 point, 2 or 3. Because of the high price of gold, it rose again, resulting in a flat performance. In the afternoon, Taihe Foreign Firm purchased, and each month rose 2 to 2.5 points. Total transactions for the day were estimated at 52,000 dans. It was found that Mao Ji sold 3,300 dans, Tian Long 3,200 dans, Shen Chang 1,900 dans, and the rest 1 to 2,000 dans. Public purchases of 2,200 dans, Tian Chang 3,100 dans, and the rest 1 to 2,000 dans. Closing prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Imported Yarn and Cotton Remain Weak</h3>

Futures prices were down 3 to 9 pounds, spot prices were down 5 pounds. English cotton futures were down 15 to 16 points, spot prices were down 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices were down 15 points. Indian cotton was weak due to the sluggish Liverpool market. Pingguo'er futures were down 2 rupees for both near and far terms.

<h3>American Cotton Suffers a Severe Blow</h3>
<p>New York, 19th Report: The cotton market for the week ended with bullish sentiment. Southern hedge funds and banks were stranded. Weakness in the stock market led to near-month futures prices falling to 9.25 cents. However, they rebounded slightly due to inter-dealer buying to cover short positions and speculative buying. Based on current market prices, it can be determined that cotton fields will inevitably be abandoned. Even the economic situation in the South indicates a reduction in the use of fertilizers in the next season. However, industry insiders still have doubts about rising prices, believing that it depends on the development of real transactions. The chairman of the Agricultural Administration stated that the cotton market has now reached a point of severe pain. The 1.3 million bales stockpiled by the Maintenance Association and the 2 million bales held by the cooperative have the ability to accumulate for three years. Weekend statistics are attached below (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1929, 1930</p>

<p>Worldwide American Cotton Consumption Since August 1st: 6891, 4743</p>
<h3>U.S. Department of Agriculture Report on Cotton</h3>
<p>The annual report of the U.S. Department of Agriculture on the cotton market states that it still emphasizes the importance of adjusting production to match demand. It also states that in recent years, there has been a trend of abandoning American cotton and using cotton from other countries. Price differences are unfavorable to American cotton, and quality differences are not as significant as before. This year's American cotton production is approximately 14.486 million bales, a decrease of 342,000 bales compared to 1929. This year's harvest can be considered sufficient to meet the reduced demand in the world market, with some surplus. The world's American cotton sales volume in 1929-1930 decreased by 2 million bales compared to the previous year, while the sales volume of Indian and other foreign cotton increased by 900,000 bales and 500,000 bales respectively. The decrease in the world's American cotton sales volume is partly due to the decrease in consumption by American cotton mills, and the remaining 1 million bales are equally divided between Continental Europe and England. Compared to the export volume in the previous year, exports to Germany decreased by 6%, exports to England decreased by 32%, and exports to Japan decreased by 21%. In the year ending June 30, 1930, the low level of American agricultural product exports was the lowest since 1915. The total value of exports this year was 14.95 million yuan, a decrease of 35.2 million yuan compared to the previous year. Although the decrease in exports is not limited to cotton, the decrease in value is largely due to the slow sales of American cotton and the lower average price.</p>
<h3>Grain and Flour Market Remains Relatively Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was generally stable. This month, as the settlement date approaches, outside short sellers are considering covering their positions. Furthermore, sales of Tianjin flour have improved recently, and the demand for Shanghai flour has surged. High-quality brands such as "Battleship" and "Double Horse" are priced around 3.2 yuan, and Shanghai yuan is already at 3.22 yuan. As a result, the standard weight for this month has become tight again. Although the distant months were initially calm due to the slight increase in imported wheat, the market also tended to be firm as outside short sellers were eager to close their positions. However, after 3:00 PM, as foreign firms came to sell imported wheat at particularly low prices, factories again started to hedge, and market sentiment weakened again. As a result, this month was up 1.5%, January was up 5%, February was up 7.5%, March-May was up 2.5%, and April was unchanged compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Recent Wheat Prices Suddenly Surge Before Settlement</h3>
<p>Estimated Increase of 31 Points</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures market for the current month saw a sudden increase in tension, resulting in a rare squeeze situation. Because the short positions for this month were filled with expectations of previous months, it was thought that bullish investors would inevitably exit their positions. Unexpectedly, the bullish investors had already prepared to take delivery of the goods beforehand. As a result, general speculative short sellers had no goods at the time of settlement and had no choice but to lower their prices to sell. As a result, the market price gradually soared, and the highest closing price was as high as 4.63 yuan, an increase of 31 points compared to the previous closing price. Although buying and selling on the exchange is free, recklessly hoping for excessive gains without goods is seemingly self-inflicted. Distant months saw mixed gains and losses due to varying sentiment. January was up 4 points, February-March were slightly up 1 point, April was unchanged, and May was slightly down 2 points. There were no transactions for current wheat, but it is estimated that the imported wheat ordered by traders totaled 1,000 tons. Australian white wheat was sold at 2.55 yuan by Ren Cheng to the Wusong factory.</p>
<h3>"Ke Xian" Rice Sales Active, Continuing to Rise by 20 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was not much "Ke Xian" rice arriving, and the local demand was even stronger. With limited arrivals and active sales, demand exceeded supply. As a result, the market was extremely active, and prices for all types of "Ke Xian" rice rose by 20 cents. If there is further inquiry from out-of-town merchants, market prices are expected to rise further. The overall market opened with Jiangxi machine-milled late rice at 11.8 yuan, Nanjing machine-milled rice at 10.019 yuan, Hunan rice at 10.03 yuan, Hunan machine-milled rice at 11.6 yuan, and Hunan oily rice at 11.5 yuan. Lower grades were priced accordingly. The market outlook remains positive.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Dali Sugar Opens at 10,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market: Sugar-producing areas reported that the price of Cuban raw sugar was unchanged. New York futures sugar for December fell by 3 points, and for March, May, and September of next year, each fell by 4 points. Javanese spot futures sugar also fell by 1 or 2 points. The Association's quotation for Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse white was quiet, but supply was still abundant, and market prices declined. High-quality sugar was priced at 8.45 yuan, and ordinary sugar was priced at 8.4 yuan. The market situation was stable. No. 20 medium white sugar was priced at 7.7 yuan, and No. 10 Dutch red sugar was priced at 7.4 yuan. Although transactions were sparse, the market remained stable. The trading of Japanese sugar was even quieter, and market sentiment was weak. YT grade was priced at 8.5 yuan, YP grade at 9 yuan, TK grade at 8.55 yuan, and YRO grade was even more deserted. The factory offered 10,000 bags of Dali sugar at a price of 4.9 yuan per day for new goods to be shipped in the current and January. Although Meiji and Minghua also sent telegrams with prices up 10 cents from the previous quotation, they were for goods to be shipped in February and March, so there was little inquiry. Hua Xin offered 2,000 bags of high-quality coarse white spot goods at a price of 8.45 yuan, and the market saw a stable price. National cotton lake red sugar opened at more than 50 bags at a price of 8.65 yuan, and the market was very active.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: All Oil Markets Firm</h3>
<p>Hankou Vegetable Oil Rises Again: Recently, Hankou vegetable oil has risen due to limited arrivals and depleted inventory. Sesame oil is estimated to have increased by 4 cents to 18.4 yuan. New Jingjian goods have not yet been seen. The local sales trend is based on the Hankou market. However, due to abundant current oil and sluggish actual sales, although it has risen, the current opening price for sesame oil from out-of-town merchants is 20.04 yuan, the trader's price is 20 yuan, imported heavy Jing is sold at 21 yuan, and flat Jing is 20.04 yuan.</p>
<p>Lan Oil Supply Still Scarce: This year's supply is very scarce due to a large crop failure (only 60%). The current selling price for famous brands is 18.4 yuan, and market sentiment is unusually firm.</p>
<p>Benzene Remains Firm: Actual sales of benzene are very smooth, and the selling price is difficult to lower. The inland price is reported to be 24.2 yuan (delivered by car). The local selling price is around 25 yuan.</p>

<h3>Green Clouds Under the Kerosene Lamp</h3>
<p>When I am in the presence of all things that do not reveal themselves, the world is only the active radiance of my great kerosene lamp dancing childlike before my eyes. At this moment, I feel that if there were an electric lamp here, its motionless light would never be so lively. Thus, I feel that my kerosene lamp is as great as I am. Beside me is a tripod clock. I usually find it too clumsy, and it is too self-effacing in my house. But now, it really deserves your attention. How spirited it is! Each sound is more urgent than the last, each sound more solemn than the last. It is obviously not relaxing itself, expressing its strength and the spirit of our tense era with its tick-tock. Now its greatness is no less than that of my kerosene lamp. Thus, my position is shaken. I feel that there is a pair of formidable friends before me. I don't know if they have ever suffered setbacks or wounds in the past, but they are not tired at all! They are still in the brand-new age of youth. I suddenly realize, oh, how insignificant I am, how dejected I am. I am completely inferior to them. This should still be considered a genuine youth! I am only in my twenties, not even a few years older. Having experienced a bit of wind and frost and endured a bit of hardship in a surging era, isn't this precisely the sweet taste on a healthy life? What does this count for? Why let it become a scar on your heart?</p>
<p>Ten years of reading and working has only made me grow in worldly wisdom, and from worldly wisdom, it has only made me lose the courage to move forward, only made me hide in a corner with walls on both sides? Hovering on the boundary of society, being swayed by the winds and waves pushed out by the crowd, is this your original foothold? When you open the door of your room tomorrow and see the people you are close to, hear the laborious calls of the porters, see elementary school life running lively into the school, then think for yourself, where are you standing in this world, this great person after your quiet time?</p>
<p>This is a cigarette, and I am smoking again. But why smoke it? Is it because you are too tired and want to use it to relax your spirit? Do you still have important work to do and want to use it to boost your energy? Is it for the sake of the pungent taste? Then put it down. You hear the tick-tock sound, you see the flickering flame of the lamp, what are you doing?</p>
<p>Cigarette packs, peanut shells, scraps of paper, look, they are everywhere. Are they from yesterday or the day before? I understand very well that I have controlled myself today and have not eaten these things. This is certainly a good thing, right? Yes, of course, not eating peanuts for a day is naturally worthy of praise. But sweep it up, even the scraps of paper and cigarette butts. You haven't swept the floor for three days. Look, hasn't the lamplight already pointed it out to you in the corner?</p>
<p>Turning my eyes to the left, golden letters suddenly jumped into my eyes. (A collection of Shakespeare's plays), a friend I have known for more than three months. She is quiet but seems very angry, she is looking at me. That's right, she is annoyed. Although it has only been three months, it is too unfamiliar for her. I haven't even read a single piece.</p>
<p>Forget it, let's not be annoyed by anything. Tomorrow, the owner of this house will want to move.</p>

<h3>Market News</h3>
<p>The Double Wheel Toothbrush Company declares that this company was the first in our country to create machine-made toothbrushes, and for more than a decade, it has always taken promoting national products and resisting foreign powers as its mission. Although the sacrifices have been great over the years, we have spared no effort. Fortunately, we have been praised by people from all walks of life and are happy to use them. Now, for the convenience of customers' purchases, a special store has been set up at the east end of Shilu on Sanma Road, which will open soon. Retail sales of various toothbrushes of this brand and famous products from major national goods factories are also available. A special low price will be offered within three weeks of the opening to repay the kindness of all customers.</p>
<p>The Bai Luode Fountain Pen Company on North Sichuan Road declares that the technicians of our factory have recently researched and manufactured a unique fountain pen and double and single pen holder with new ideas. Since it first arrived at our company, it has been very popular with customers. Now, during the winter solstice discount period, the store is even more lively. It can be seen that people appreciate beauty, which is truly true.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Coca-Cola Company declares that at this time of advanced machinery, the machines used in this factory almost completely replace human labor. The entire process of manufacturing Coca-Cola and bottling is done entirely by machinery without any human contact. The most important step is the disinfection of the bottles. Once the bottles are disinfected, the drink can naturally remain pure. Two washers are used, placed at both ends of an extremely long circular belt. There are many small bags on the belt, and each bag holds one bottle. Jumping on one end of the washer, each jump causes the bottle to be turned upside down onto a single tube. This tube shoots a very strong caustic soda water upwards. This washing method is repeated as many as forty-two times. At the same time, the outside of the bottle is cleaned by a rotating brush. After this procedure, the mechanical movement transfers the bottles from the belt to the washer at the other end. This device has another row of tubes that emit clean, pure water to wash the inside and outside of the bottles. Every bottle must go through this disinfection procedure before it can be used to inject Coca-Cola.</p>
<p>The Asia-America Company declares that December 23 is the anniversary of the company's broadcasting station's first week of broadcasting. On this day, various materials, supplies, books, etc. will be specially discounted for one day, and the broadcasting program will be specially increased to entertain the audience. The broadcasting time for that day is listed below: 9:45 to 10:15, business news and old-fashioned records; 10:45 to 11:25, Shanghai Beach records; 12:15 to 12:40, short tune records; 1:00 to 1:30, four music records; 2:45 to 3:00, business news and Qinqiang records; 3:00 to 3:30, Kunqu records; 4:30 to 4:50, drum song records; 5:30 to 6:00, news 片 records; 6:00 to 6:20, Cantonese records; 6:30 to 7:25, storytelling; 7:35 to 8:30, storytelling; 8:30 to 8:45, song records; 8:45 to 9:45, special program, Shi Chunxuan Shanghai opera.</p>
<p>The Yimandeng Company at No. 9, Central House, No. 93 Sichuan Road, declares that the manager of this company has newly invented a platinum-decorated pocket stove that can keep warm for 24 hours. It is clean, elegant, lightweight, and exquisite, and the price is fair. There has been a large crowd of customers in the past few days.</p>
<p>The Xiang Sheng Trading Company declares that a new type of artistic New Year card has recently been discovered on the market. The style is extremely unique and the printing is very exquisite, which is very different from ordinary greeting cards on the market. The dozens of patterns are all pressed by machines. For example, the flower basket is completely pressed into a flower basket. The card is also equipped with a beautiful and exquisite calendar, so it can be hung on the wall or placed on the desk, which is both practical and has preservation value. It will surely be warmly welcomed by the recipient if it is given to relatives and friends. Compared with other greeting cards that are rigid in style and cannot be preserved, they are really incomparable. This new type of New Year card was invented by our company at No. 30, Caojia Street, West Gate, this port. Sincere, Wing On, New Sun and other companies, as well as World, Great Eastern, Qixin Civilization and other bookstores are selling them. The price is divided into two types, one dime and one dime two cents.</p>
<p>The China Gold Star Company declares that the newly invented pocket warmer is small in size, has a moderate temperature, and is very convenient to carry around. It is definitely an essential item for keeping out the cold, and it is far superior to imported products. The general wholesale office is attached to the Fuchangxiang Paint Shop in Fuyuli, Tiantang Street, French Concession, this port. Separate sales offices are located at Yingming Photo Studio at the intersection of Yingda Road and Wangping Street, and in major stores.</p>
<p>The Tao Tao Restaurant on Chongming Road, North Sichuan Road, declares that this restaurant was the first formal Guangzhou restaurant founded by Cantonese people in Shanghai. The dishes are specially prepared, the taste is excellent, and Shanghai people all know its reputation far and wide. Every evening, guests flock here. Ten years ago and now, a new branch has been opened at the former Anle site in Wuchang. It has been greatly renovated and redecorated. The halls are magnificent and the equipment is sophisticated. It took several months to set up before it opened on December 7th of the lunar calendar. Since its opening, the new hall's rooms have been reserved, and the seats for old customers are often full. Those who arrive later have almost no space in the new and old halls, and business is booming. The materials used are refined and clean, the cooking is delicious, the seating is elegant, and the service is attentive. I dare to inform those who like to eat Cantonese cuisine that Da Zhong and Da San Yuan are also branches of the same family, so the name is called Three Great Restaurants.</p>
<p>The Yonghua Department Store in West New Bridge declares that this company opened yesterday with a complete range of goods and low prices. The goods are excellent, and the customers are extremely enthusiastic. The store's sales were more than 45,000 yuan. In addition, the company's banking savings department also received more than 10,000 yuan in deposits, a new record that has never been seen in a store.</p>
