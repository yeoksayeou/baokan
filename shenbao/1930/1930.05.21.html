<p>時評</p>
<h3>墨索里尼之海軍計劃</h3>
<p>意相墨索里尼。反對倫敦公約。一再表示其貫澈擴張。海軍之主張一再發不惜犧牲近乎挑戰之言論。論者謂其不滿於此次會議之不公平。而又鑒於所處地位之危險。不得不振作奮興。藉海軍之力以自固。其實不然。意國之急急於擴張海軍。圖爭霸於歐洲者。不自今日始。蓋自實行法西斯蒂主義。而即具此勃勃之雄心焉。意自實行法西斯蒂以來。不僅其政治。絶對反對民主自由平等主義。即其經濟。亦用法西斯蒂之經濟計劃。敎育亦用法西斯蒂之敎育計劃。軍隊亦用法相斯蒂之軍隊。且自法西斯蒂行。而益注全力於海陸空軍之擴。張近世界社曾有一文。述意相對於報館記者之談話。力自稱許法西斯蒂之成功。謂有適合世界之可能性。而反斥德謨克拉西爲不適於現在。可知欲以海軍爭雄於世界。即不啻欲欲推廣其獨裁專斷之思想權力於世界。其其欲以海軍挑戰。即不啻以法西斯蒂與民主平等自由主義挑戰。誠足令人驚歎其膽量之大矣。然試一考其國内法西斯蒂之成績。政治僅苟安於一時經濟則以勞動爲犧牲。敎育則以壓迫爲能事。軍隊亦未見有戰勝之事實。則其所詡法西斯蒂之成功。未知何在。總之在今日之世界。民主自由平等之空氣。必愈趨於公開普遍。歐洲諸國中。雖亦有迷信意國之法西斯蒂。一時亦若有蓬勃之生氣者。然此等畸形之發展。久必歸於淘汰。今意相以其獨裁專斷之手段。偶然未遭打擊。而遽自信爲萬能。遽欲與世界同趨之潮流抗。此乃墨索里尼根本之誤點。至其對於海軍之躍躍欲試。旁若無人之狀態。其誤謬亦即由斯而來。非關於倫敦會議之若何結果也。</p>

<h3>寄往外洋郵件將加價</h3>
<p>本年六月一日起實行</p>
<p>平信包裹增百分五十</p>
<p>但日本南洋各埠不加</p>
<p>交通部决定寄往外洋郵件自六月一日起、加價百分之五十、詳情如下、</p>
<p>（一）經過交部前以金價暴漲、我國寄往外洋郵件、係照銀價收費、虧累甚鉅、爲補救計、曾擬具加價辦法、呈由行政院轉國府核辦、現國府巳指令照准、交部特訓令郵政總辦劉書蕃、依法定手續、通知萬國郵政公會、說明中國寄往外洋郵件、自六月一日起、一律增加百分之五十、請該會轉告各會員國知照、</p>
<p>（二）範圍此次加價、以地域言、祇限於寄往歐美諸國者、香港日本南洋各埠·及澳非洲、均不在内、以郵件分類言、祗限於平信及包裹两種、快信掛號信保險信仍舊、其寄往美國之包裹、以條約關係、亦暫不加價、</p>
<p>（三）影響我國以交通設備簡陋、對外郵運、均假手他人、年出巨數運費、故收支相抵、每年短絀約二百萬左右、三年金價暴漲、虧欠當不止此、加價後則定可保持收支相抵比例、又據統計、中國人寄往外洋郵件、僅得五分之一、故加價後影響國人利益、實至有限、</p>

<h3>十二結論</h3>
<p>本屆全敎會議之經過情形、及所議决之方案各種計劃、旣撮要如上述、待中央政治會議核定後、即人於實施之階段、至方案本身之價值、與對於方案實施之希望、在會議所發表之宣言中、巳有明白的叙述節錄於次以作本篇之結論　　「這次會議的方案、分看雖有十章、但合起來是整個的、方案的編製、是就全國敎育作一個通盤打算、力矯各不相謀的弊病所以各章各節、完全是互相關聨所有的精神、也是全體一貫、我們在議决全方案時、有两點特别注意、一是依據事實需要、分定期間步驟、二是根據敎育旨宗、力求實現三民主義關於第一點、方案的精神、是在根據現在和將來的需要、分定出先後緩急尤其在訓政六年期内、我們深切感到全國有百分之八十以上不識字的民衆和大多數沒有受過敎育機會的兒童、是推行訓政和建設的障礙也就是推進民族文化大阻力、所以在訓政六年期内對於義務敎育和成年補習敎育、主盡量推進、而對於中等敎育和高等敎育、主整理充實、先求質量的提高、不遽作數量的增進、固然爲應目前最迫切的需要、應該以大部份物質精神的力量、集中在義務和成年補習敎育上面、但爲提高文化的程度、中等敎育和高等敎育、在目前也確實有整理充實的必要、所以這两方面、並不相反而實相成、關於第二點、我們爲求民生的發展、所以在各級各類的敎育内、都注重科學實騐、培養生産能力、養成職業技能、我們爲求民權普遍、所以在社會敎育和成年補習敎育計劃内、注重公民訓練、而在各級學校敎育内、也注重規律、和團體恊作習慣的養成、以植運用四權的基礎、我們爲完全達到民族的獨立、所以在社成敎育和學校敎育内、注重民族獨立的精神、並規定初等敎育、不應讓外國人士來代勞、尤其爲實現民族主義、鞏固國家主權、對於華僑敎育和蒙藏敎育、主張用國家力量來扶助和推進、我們更爲顧到整個的三民主養敎育的實現、必須以大多數人民爲對象、所以對於社會敎育的設施、有分期擴充的規定、並且議决了推行注首識字運動的、請敎育當局加以積極提倡、</p>
<p>「以上約略地把本會議决定方案的主要精神和注重點叙述了我們認爲這一個二十年期的方案、是一個根據事實而定的最低限度的方案、但在我國經濟落後人才缺的狀况下、要實施這一部方案、確是一件十分艱重的工作、必須要敎育者大家有責任的自覺、黨國政府用全力來領導督促、全國同胞、確認爲百年大計而一致恊作、才有按期實施的希望因此我們希望全國的敎育者、應當確認犧牲是我們的本分、敎育是一種靖獻國家的事業、而不僅僅是一種職業、必須知此纔能提起敎育界的精神、克服一切障礙和困難、從辛苦艱難中、使方案整個的實現、我們希望政府能不辭任何艱難、就本方案所定的預算内籌立必需的經費、並且實行保障敎費的獨立、使得現有的整理和逐期的攺進、都不受絲毫的影響、我們更希望政府訂定並實施敎育人員保障辦法使實施方案時、不致因人員更迭而遇到停頓和更變、也不使敎育界再發生校長跟着主管行政人員更動敎員跟着校長更動的現象、必須如此纔有安心負責實行各級各叚計畫的人、也纔有必要限度内充足的費用、我們又希望全國的同胞認定敎育的責任並不是辦敎育者所獨有、在我國目前的狀况下、敎育確實比任何事業都重要、古人說敎養兼施、我們的情形是不敎將無以爲養在常人或以爲先富後敎我們的國情、是不能容許敎育事業再有片刻的延緩和等待、所以又必須全國人人引育爲自身責任、而後中國纔有敎育可談、」（完）</p>

<h3>記鮑曼事·盧·叔·韞</h3>
<p>曩在滬時。因趙君乙齋之介。獲識西友鮑曼君。DouglasHBowman。游两載。深佩其人。頃趙君以事來京。晤談之後。始悉鮑君將於月内偕其夫人渡洋回國。爰書其軼事數端。爲我國人告。亦聨以壯鮑君之行色也。</p>
<p>君蘇格蘭籍。旅滬巳二十餘年。爲人美丰儀。擅辭令。沈毅果敢自信甚深。與人交。謙恭有禮。無英人之傲態。以旅華久。深知我國之情形。與華人有特殊之好感。平時服用起居。多力趨華化。嘗應聘爲倫敦孟吉斯德指導報之駐滬通信員。每論述華事。輙能主持正義。力陳西人耳食之妄。於英艦砲轟萬縣事。尤慷槪激昻。痛詆屠殺政策爲滅絶人道。引爲英人之奇恥。當時英國野朝之野心家。聞而譁然。坐是不合時宜。與主事者意見益左。遂憤而辭職。又嘗一度執敎鞭於工部局設立之某公學。每課餘則集其徒。操滬語娓娓談世界之風物。莊諧雜出。奇趣横生。故學生尤樂與。之游。歐戰初啓。君應募兵役。離滬回英被遣赴歐洲大陸參加作戰。衝鋒陷陣。屢奏膚功。當轉戰於法國邊境時。薢茩一西班牙女子。两情繾　。熱度沸騰。遽與之訂婚約。顧此女本有情人。以戰亂離失。誤傅巳死。後君適值其情敵於某處。相與互道平生。始恍然知羅敷之巳有夫。其情敵以君攘其愛人。要以决鬭。故事。情敵决鬭。理無返顧。然君於此役。竟婉言謝絶。自甘退讓。雖當時人多嗤之。而君怡然不以爲忤。其舍巳從人之處。誠不可及。旋其情敵亦心儀其行。意良不安。爲之物色一女友。力任撮合。即君今日之夫人也。嗣復挈其夫人返滬。受雇爲舊金山韓企生公司之駐滬代理人。業餘多暇。恒喜歷訪華友。抵掌劇談。嘗謂中國今日内亂頻仍。民生凋敝。若不幡然返悟。勵治圖强。則國運前途。殊堪憂慮。然天下事求人不如求己。人之口頭親善。不足恃也。中國固有之文化。垂四五千年而不墜。其價值可想而知。誠能發揚而光大之。即稱雄於世界。亦意中事耳。且華人體質强健。習於勞苦。無論處寒帶熱帶。皆足以抵抗其環境而有餘。而其天賦優厚。尤非白人所可企及。常見外人之習華語者。類多期期艾艾。不能盡如人意。而華人之操外國語者。則每能嫻熟流利。談笑風生。又華人可以御西服而益增其華貴之態度。然試以長袍馬褂。加諸白人之身。則滑稽失態。未有不嗤其爲癎發矣。甚矣。即一聲帶之搆造。一衣裝之服用。而不可勉强也如是。惟華人亦有一不良之風習即一般人皆有「各人自掃門前雪」之心理。迷信無爲而治。以苟安畏縮爲美德。此則甚非近世優勝劣敗之公例所許。深願華人能急起直追。自强不息。勿以一切委諸命運。則如干年後。不難轉弱爲强也云云。是君之對於我國。可謂知者深而期者切矣。今君將回國。特表而出之。以爲我國人勗。</p>
<h3>如是我聞·洗·眼·重·來·客</h3>
<p>浴佛節過去巳逾旬矣。昨有客自下河來者。爲述浴佛中之種種，逸趣横生。是不可以不記。爰分書。之。以博閱者一齒粲。客劉氏鹽城人。述數事存其二。　　是我是我客云。下河流域。以如臯一邑。爲最佞佛。邑有張氏婦。早寡。年巳五十外。長齋茹素。惟佛是依。鄰人顧三。中年無子。納一姬。巳一年矣。熊夢未徵。而勃谿時有。此亦慣例。無足奇者。乃姬忽於匝月間。得河魚之疾。有時而暴下。有時而點滴。飲食銳减。憔悴可憐。而大婦轉拊循之。曰個妮子自違忤耳。吾寗明斥之。不乘其病而虐之也。然姬固機警。托張婦代唪金剛經自懺。且訴曰。昔吾母作一瞞人事。遇高僧直揭其隱。斷其死期。竟不爽。今我之病。不敢自諱。平日實不順大娘。此後當攺。因歷數某事與大婦不利。某語使夫啣大婦。又曰我怕我怕。浴佛節近。佛眼燭幽。故告姆以减罪。張婦聞之。乃汗出如瀋。合掌下拜曰。是我是我。蓋張婦追念當年房闥事。代人行妬。使大婦以瀉藥入飲食以危姬也。張婦愚而可憐。顧姬亦狡而多智哉。</p>
<p>得其所哉客又言富室胡子珉。世居通如間之某村。以善男子而信佛如嫗。今年浴佛節。廣收魚蝦及蛤類。付一奚童。使之放生。先是子珉家有傭工三五人。喁喁聚語於茶市間。扼腕太息。時奚童猶未入胡氏門也。就問之。則曰。主人尖刻。平時自奉極豐。靜室唪經聲。與廚下刳剔洗剥聲相應。而我輩終年不得嘗一臠。食有餘雖盛暑。不以予人。寗餒敗而傾諸河。童曰。請薦我往。必能使君等一飽。迨浴佛前三日。一募化僧登門。指其殺生太過。不於浴佛日大放生。必有咎。又以手按摩之。隨所按而呻楚。僧。曰孳障哉。禍不遠矣。子珉大恐求救。曰允放生即無事。又撫之。果不痛。此放生之所由來也。僧爲童之舅。所放衆生。半果諸人之腹。而其半則易錢以予僧。得其所哉。鄭校人有後身矣。</p>
<h3>記别饒興趣之一塲貓狗官司</h3>
<p>·黄·影·呆</p>
<p>昨接友人自北平來信。謂北平城内。最近發生一塲貓狗官司。别饒興趣。因錄其詳情於后。</p>
<p>北平有王德林其人者。家中畜有一貓。愛護惟謹。不料日前貓偶外出。爲鄰家之犬所咬斃。德林聞之悲痛倍常。即往鄰家。與狗主交涉。而畜狗者則爲一寡婦也。當塲提出條件。此寡婦須購一棺材。以備葬貓之用。而埋葬之時。寡婦之子。須披麻帶孝。隨於貓棺之後。以作孝子。婦聞之。當即以洋二元。購一木棺。並僱扛夫二人。設法將棺抬往郊外。掘土埋葬。惟乃子充作孝子一事。勢難照辦。蓋其子年巳二十。婦雖應允。彼亦必不願爲貓帶孝也。然王竟不允謂寡婦之子。如不披麻帶孝。隨於棺後。則將相見於法庭云。事聞於鄰右。有張某者。有名之拳術家也。其力頗大。聞此消息。大抱不平。乃往寡婦之家。加以安慰。並囑其勿服從此苛刻之條件。而一方至王德林之家中。向王勸阻。王聞言。大怒。以爲此事與張無涉。張實無權過問。雙方爭執之下。竟至動武。而此王德林者。結果竟被張某痛打一頓。受傷頗重。警察聞之。急將二人拘入警局。寡婦及子。亦巳傅到。以資對質。現巳解送法院。加以鞫訊云。</p>

<h3>一個值得注意的統計·盛</h3>
<p>南方的農田。大都靠着湖沼以行灌漑。但是像那北邊的地方。湖沼來得稀少。所以遇了旱年。便有飢饉之憂。列子說道。人定可以勝天。這句話。眞是極有理由。近來。北方都能注意鑿井了。鑿井愈多。農田越有保障。即便遇有乾旱。亦得補救的方法了。據調查的人說。北方鑿井最多的。莫如河北的定縣。單就定縣的翟城村講。該村村中有井九十六眼。村外有井二百九十四眼。。平均起來。該村每家有一口井每井除了供給飲料外。還可灌溉二三十畝田以至四十畝田。翟城村以外的六十二個村莊。綜計有井六千二百零八眼井。大約每個村莊有一百眼井換。而言每两家就得有一眼井灌溉之便。可以想見一斑。所以有許多人說。北方如果都像定縣那麽熱心的鑿井。斷不會連年累歲的閙着乾旱的苦痛呢。聞華洋義賑會和中華敎育攺進社俱努力門擴大鑿井的宣稱。那眞是北方的一種福音呢。</p>

<p>絲茶歐美電轉絲價頗小</p>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、仍乏新發展之趨勢、查海外絲電雖有轉滬、惜來價小、華商以新繭價昂、成本不鬆、談判難望就範、昨祇乾利進六月份中身滬廠經、新陳統解五十包、開利進黄廠經二十包、價仍不漲云、</p>
<h3>嘉屬繭價步漲</h3>
<p>嘉興各鄉新繭、陸續上市、繭行開秤、巳有四五日、繭價初開祇五十至五十四五元、嗣因各行爭收優繭、攺良種高貨巳開六十四元、普通貨亦五十六元、蠶户索價較高、繭身尙優、後市看漲云、</p>
<h3>屯德新茶紛紛開秤</h3>
<p>休屬新茶、山户近日均採畢園園、惟産額銳减、有感供不敷求、現屯市各號爲趕進新茶開揀、均派員赴徽浙贛産茶地採辦、連日由德興·玉山·遂安·華埠·婺源·歙縣·等路運到新茶頗夥、開出新盤、自六十元至八十餘元、但其中高莊細嫩貨甚少、號家去胃、尙未十分舒暢、刻屯市茶號開塲者、計有四十餘家、較舊歲减三分之一、市面雖見熱閙而號商對茲山價開支之增大、前途多抱悲觀、</p>
<p>德邑今歲高低莊新茶、山户採摘較早、匪靖之區、谷雨前後均相繼開園、故茶芽出貨嫩頭、選製珍眉原料頗多、屯溪茶號、以本地茶産欠收、均紛紛向德搜買、舒家坂新茶、巳由屯客開秤、盤價六十五元、婺源茶號、亦以德茶出貨細嫩、分在各鄉搜辦、連日購運不少、盤價自六十至七十元、此外德興新茶、近爲玉山茶號大帮開秤、盤價自四十元至五十元、惟本地茶號、因匪患猖獗、德城·海口·商店一律罷市、原有預備開塲茶號、現俱停頓僅新建·丁村两處、各有茶號一家、巳在開塲云、（十四日）</p>
<h3>婺源茶價傾跌二十元</h3>
<p>婺邑新茶、經各號搜辦後、山户以成本過鉅、非價高不售、故號户相持數日、開秤殊鮮、除清華·戴村·豸山·出盤八十元外、餘均靳不開秤、刻各號因山價太高、茶洋難辦、食米缺乏、滬市、土莊珍眉開盤、較舊見低十餘两、於是茶商態度驟轉消極、均主少進、辦做一帮完塲、市面遂趨冷淡、山户見號方心思不振、俱願就範、昨日順泰茶號、在新源思溪開秤定價六十二元、延川由本村茶號收買、定價六十元南鄉太白一帶開秤、定價五十五元、較前數日新盤傾跌二十元、如此價格、山户僅敷成本、茶號以此盤價尙低、紛紛搜辦、日内可望大批開秤、憔茶號目前之最大難題、則現洋與食米、昨日票價、激漲一千三百四十二元、食米更無從辦來、茶工巳感缺食、故各號對茲两難題、異常焦急云、（十二日）</p>
<p>糧食天雨米市停頓</p>
<p>昨日南北两方到源均績寥、寥而本街市消因上午清朝陰雨、致賣買雙方一律觀望、市交因河斛難開、婉如停頓、白粳米最高價仍開二十一元、滬南二十元、惟閘市表面上仍以二十元爲高、因事實上殊難遵限、緣内地産價划申、上高貨悉須二十元關外、故環境與實際殊非局外之制力所能也而蘇同中次等粳則均受買方之修評、貨客亦順市而行、全日因天雨影影、亦乏成交、羊杜各尖與變陰等元亦悉告沉寂、况秈米因洋米之步軟、市氣亦甚不振、大盤因交易靜莫統無準市、而滬南之陰元、則有少數客帮問津、價格續見呆定、</p>
<h3>粉市狂漲達於沸點</h3>
<p>近期逼近六錢··後市略回</p>
<p>昨日粉市、各月份市氣之狂激、彷彿巳臻極點、本月份二两六錢之預測巳經相差無幾當最高時、曾抬到二两五錢九分、其餘月份、亦買氣甚激、本月份以軋空之故、繼漲增高、尙有可說、遠期究屬新粉、麥尙在田、此種亦步亦趨之硬抬、甚爲不解、如六月份最高至二两四錢一分半、七月份至三錢半、八月份至三錢四分、半九月份至三錢六分二厘半、十月份至三錢七分、新粉而有此價、不知一到落令、尙有限度之可言、迨至下午開盤、以多頭出籠、市呈大漲小回之象、與最高價計落一分餘、以後步觀察、尙有再度回好之勢、結果本下月份較前日又漲一分、七八月份漲二厘半、九月份漲七厘半、十月份漲五厘云、</p>
<h3>期麥爲粉市帶高</h3>
<p>開新麥之最高紀錄</p>
<p>昨日期麥一致上漲、查此種漲、勢大部分爲粉市所帶起、而昨又天雨、業外人心、自然興高采烈、盡力購進、故洋麥雖報小三四角、未受影響、且一再上漲、均開新麥之最高紀錄、觀後步如天時不佳、則内地帮心思、仍有繼續望高之象、結果六七八十月份較前日各漲三分、九月份漲四分、現麥極準雖步步高昂、廠家則大致觀望、不願過分放價、故交易甚少、價祇較好一分、開徐州麥南宿州麥清江浦麥五两一錢六分、共開七百包云、</p>
<h3>洋米逐步下跌</h3>
<p>昨日洋米雖仍有各帮問津、然均係少數、長江各埠亦無大批去化、奈到存两旺、截至月底當有四五十萬之總數存積、則日銷一二萬包、未能支持市面、更因各地客帮購存者、欲了結歸去、市價乃不得不小、昨日統又回小角許、計一號西貢三千包、高十五元四角、次至十五元一角、敏當二千包、價十四元六角至十四元四角、大絞四百包、價十四元二角半、小絞六千包、價十四元四角至十四元一角、小絞糙米五百包、價十三元一角半云</p>
<p>疋頭東疋漢帮搜辦驟殷</p>
<p>疋頭交易、昨以東貨銷路爲暢、漢帮搜辦甚烈、雙意鹿元直貢呢成交一百餘件、致價由二錢三分二厘半漲至七厘半、下身細嗶嘰去路亦暢、百子圖二錢三分、湖心亭二錢三分七厘半、俱屬塌貨性質、本街昨白縐布有採辦、銀判爲三两五錢、焦葉題書條子三两零七分半、愛司狗二两九錢七分半、售去五十餘件、藍條色汀因存貨充斥趨勢復軟紫金山一錢六分二厘半扣佣四學士一錢五分七厘半尙乏人問津印花直貢呢邇來逐步上漲秃大紅巳二錢九分秃元色二錢八分七厘半什色亦須二錢八分、較前漲五厘左右、西貨昨因終朝下雨、本客走銷均靜、漂布漢鎭等帮略有辦去、和記養同管鮑爲十两、公平海上名妓九两三錢半、泰和紅鷄十一两云</p>
<p>糖市粗砂白市忽轉挫</p>
<p>昨日糖市産區電訊、古巴現糖價一·四三七五、比前電回跌○六二五、紐約期糖五月份一·三八、九月份一·五四十二月份一·六四明年三月份一·七二、比前各跌四分、獨十二月份跌三分、爪哇現糖價九·六二五、六七月份期糖價均九·五○、比前依然無升沉、公會粗砂白自前日突然轉升後、昨市買氣轉靜、蓋以走消呆滯、且聞到貨將有湧來、市面突受挫折成交價爲七两○五分、需要仍寥、市象且弱、二十號中砂白六两九錢半、交易亦稀、日糖N嘜七两五錢七分半、YT嘜七两五錢三分七厘半、YP嘜七两七錢二分半、YRO嘜七两二錢半、J嘜八两一錢二分半、雖交易零落、市象頗爲穩秀云、</p>
<p>五金芝蔴釘漲二三两</p>
<p>三分至六分芝蔴釘、因成本高大、同業所在經售者、莫不需虧負二三两之多、刻則滙兌暴縮、成本大增、各同業莫不呌苦連天、昨經公會討議、準每單箱加價二三两不等、以資維持、如三分售二十一两五錢、四分二十两、五分二十两○二錢半、六分十九两五錢、交易尙旺、惟開出行情、多屬情面關係、故每箱比議價多減小五錢之譜、聞買進者均屬長江各帮云、</p>

<h3>中國公學校長問題萍</h3>
<p>中國公學校長胡適之辭職一節早巳見諸報端、但是終未得校董會的批准、擱置到現在巳有四個多月了、最近胡校長又在校董會提出務必辭職之二大理由、（一）爲完成他十年來的著作、（二）須應美國耶魯大學講學之請、所以不得不離開中公、現在把校董會允許胡校長辭職的佈告錄在下面以供衆覽、而明中公校長辭職的經過、</p>
<p>自從十七年四月底、我們把中國公學交給胡校長、到於今两年多了、两年多的中公、無論以學生的數上思想上都有很大的發展、無論何人都承認現在的中公是中國較好的大學、這是胡校長两年多在中公的努力我們很佩服胡校長這樣的努力很希望今後中公因胡校長的努力、能有更大的發展、以中國較好的大學、發展到世界著名的大學但是我們知到胡校長有比經營一個世界著名大學更大的事業要他去做、故那幾部國内外期望十年的大著作要他寫成所以我們雖再三强留他然亦常當允許他找人繼任</p>
<p>本年一月十二日校董會第四次席上胡校長辭職、推馬君武先生繼任馬先生是中公的剏辦人是二十三年前中公的總敎習是二十年來著名的科學家、是敎育界的老前輩、是中國思想革命的領導者、胡校長要把中公交給他、好讓自己專力寫成那幾部大著作、要他來繼任、要他來保證胡先生去後的中公充分發展、因此我們認定、「胡走必須馬來馬不來胡不許走、」後來馬不果來、我們更不能不强留胡校長、</p>
<p>「三月十二日、」胡校長「開始寫定中古哲學史、」到了五月三日、「五十日寫成十萬字」他說、三四個月可以成書两册」我們看見他「五十日寫成」的「十萬字、」聽見他「三四個月成書两册」的計劃不能不把這個可以終斷他寫二三十萬字大著作的計劃的中公校長問題、趕快解决、讓他在「明年一月赴美講學」以前、專心結束這部國内外人期望十年的世界名著及其他者作因此我們在五月五日校董會臨時席上、帮同胡校長勸馬先生允許繼任因此、我們批准胡校長五月三日的辭職書、推馬君武先生爲校長、</p>

<p>中華民國十九年五</p>

<h3>第四十章德意志文學的古典時代</h3>
<p>古典時代的最初的人物夫里特希哥托里勃克洛卜斯托克並且克里斯托夫馬丁薇蘭出現的時候、文學界的狀態就是那樣子在或一意味上、這两個人代表着上面所述的两個傾向即密耳頓風和法蘭西風、然而两人還更加深進克洛斯托克的長六步句的叙事詩「救世主」、在今日固然成爲不可讀的東西了、然而那力和語法的氣品却也委實對於爲了戰爭和飢餓從歐羅巴的文學隔絶的德意志人、使其確信他們祖國的語言是容易和别的偉大的文學底語言相匹敵的媒介、不但如此、克洛卜斯托克的「頌詩」往往還有着單單的品位和雄辯以上的東西那頌詩在那最高之處、有着想像和銳利、至今還可以算在十八世紀的較爲形式底的抒情詩那最優者之中的、</p>
<p>薇蘭在各點都和嚴肅的『詩人底』的克洛卜斯托克相對立、他在氣質上是法蘭西底的、然而儘他的時代所許、他出於法蘭西人的背後而行向希臘人那里去、他行向偉大的意大利人那里、阿利握斯妥和塔索那里去、他又行向莎士比亞那里、而作了那戲曲的最早的德意志譯文數種、他的柔韌·平易·鮮明·流暢、於他本國的讀者和作者有着難量的恩惠、而他那哲學底羅曼斯『亞迦桑』和以阿利渥斯妥的『八句體』寫成的羅曼底叙事詩『奥佩朗』、至今還是可讀的、</p>
<p>在我們講到巨匠之前、還有一個先驅者須說一下、這先驅者即佐罕哥特夫里赫得、他不是詩人、沒有寫過什麽可紀念的作品、只不過刋行些文選和批評底斷片、却是培養或一時代全體的文學的萌芽底精神之一、他的莎士比亞·奥細安的研究、根本底批評底問題的研究是多實的、有着最上的意義者即他發見一切國土的民謡詩的至上價值這一端、他的『現於歌謠上的諸國民之聲』打破了人巧底的古典底學藝復興期文化的優勢、對於民謠·俗謠並且歌謠的開發給開了路、這些、至後代是成着羅曼底運動全體及比較言語學·比較神話學·民俗學等的羅曼底諸學所自發生的源泉的、</p>

<h3>Mussolini's Naval Plan</h3>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Mussolini opposes the London Treaty. He has repeatedly expressed his intention to expand his navy and has repeatedly issued statements that he is willing to make sacrifices, almost challenging the treaty. Commentators say that he is dissatisfied with the unfairness of this conference and, given the danger of his position, he must cheer himself up and strengthen himself with the power of the navy. But this is not the case. Italy's eagerness to expand its navy and compete for hegemony in Europe did not begin today. It has had this ambition since implementing Fascism. Since implementing Fascism, Italy has not only absolutely opposed democracy, freedom, and egalitarianism in its politics, but also used Fascist economic plans, Fascist education plans, and Fascist armies in its economy, education, and military. Since the implementation of Fascism, it has devoted all its efforts to expanding its army, navy, and air force. 近世界社 once published an article describing the Italian Prime Minister's conversation with newspaper reporters, in which he strongly praised the success of Fascism, saying that it has the possibility of being suitable for the world and criticizing democracy as unsuitable for the present. It can be seen that the desire to compete with the navy for world power is tantamount to wanting to promote its dictatorial and autocratic ideology and power to the world. Its desire to challenge with the navy is tantamount to challenging democracy, equality, and freedom with Fascism. It is truly astonishing to see its boldness. However, if we examine the achievements of Fascism in Italy, we see that politics is only temporarily stable, the economy is sacrificed for labor, education is only capable of oppression, and the army has not seen any victories. Then, the success of Fascism that it boasts of is unknown. In short, in today's world, the air of democracy, freedom, and equality will inevitably become more open and universal. Although some European countries are superstitious about Italian Fascism and seem to have a vigorous vitality for a while, such abnormal developments will eventually be eliminated. Now that the Italian Prime Minister's dictatorial and autocratic methods have not been hit by chance, he suddenly believes that he is omnipotent and wants to resist the trend of the world. This is Mussolini's fundamental mistake. As for his eagerness to try the navy and his attitude of ignoring everyone, his fallacy also comes from this. It is not about what results the London Conference had.</p>

<h3>Beiping Party Affairs Meeting</h3>
<p>Eight people attended, it was a talking nature.</p>
<p>There is still no solution to the party's reunification.</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 1 PM this afternoon, the Party Affairs Meeting in Huai Rentang was attended by Hu Zongduo, Ye Qi, Tao Yegong, Zhang Zhiben, Qin Zhen, Fu Rulin, Xie Chi, and Mao Quan. Chen Gongbo, Wang Faqin, Bai Yunti, and Guo Taiqi were absent. It is said that Wang recently telegraphed, modifying the Guangdong Second Congress Declaration, that unity must be based on Party reunification, and that the leftists are willing to completely cede Party affairs and political status to those who are enthusiastic about the country. In short, the spirit of the law must maintain the factual rights. The Western Mountain faction believes that since Wang has cooperated with Yan and us, he must abandon Party reunification and accommodate the facts. Because the Guangdong Second Congress has requested the help of right-wing and military leaders, Party reunification, combined with our personnel, can facilitate Wang's side, and all political and military personnel and non-party members can participate in the work, otherwise it is not complete and does not conform to Yan's intentions. The eight people present in Huai Rentang today, according to Hu Zongduo, said that he is representing Li Zongren, Ye Qi is representing Huang Shaoxiong, Zhang Zhiben is a candidate member of the First Congress, Tao Yegong is representing Zou Lu, and Qin and Xie are of the Shanghai Second Congress and Fu is of the First Congress. (20th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Western Mountain faction has recently organized the Sun Wenism Society, backed by dozens of young people. In addition, most young people in the Datong League Reform Group and Xingzhong support Party reunification, saying that since unity is mentioned, those who are outside of unity should be included. The focus of Party affairs is not on the number of committees. A compromise settlement still needs to wait a little longer. The truth is like this. (20th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zou Lu said to visitors that he had a fever in Bing and has recently recovered. Due to car sickness, he plans to go to the hospital for two days of rest. Regarding the Party affairs issue, he heard that the Tianjin meeting abandoned Party reunification and implemented unity. He deeply agrees, and he hopes that everyone will follow the direction of the entire Party. As for the Guangdong Second Congress, if it must issue a declaration, it is best to only express the end and not mention other things. The Shanghai Second Congress should also issue a statement to end it. He will visit Qin Zhen and hold a meeting with Chi Di Zuquan, Fu Rulin, and Zhao Pilian on the 20th, and then plan to meet with Chen Gongbo and others on the 21st. (20th) (Beiping) Last night, at He Jiaju's house, Zou, Xie, Zhao, and Mao talked about the meeting on the 20th, preparing that if the Guangdong Second Congress can sacrifice Party reunification and follow the entire intention, a joint statement can be issued, and Zou and others will telegraph Yan and Feng to organize the government as soon as possible. On the other hand, Party unions and lower-level cadres in various provinces and regions asked Chen Gongbo and others to respect the Party's position, expressing that we do not want to be officials and are not speculating. That is why we have become the whole, which is exactly what the Yanshi said is not difficult to fight, but difficult to handle Party affairs and government after the war. Therefore, politics is born from Party reunification, please ask Chen to explain the difficulties to Zou, Xie, and others. Only by organizing according to Party reunification will we be willing to be in the opposition and completely cede Party affairs and political status to those who are virtuous. In this way, our hearts can be revealed. It remains to be seen whether Chen Gongbo can fully present this idea to the meeting. Wang Faqin said, "Please rest assured, young comrades." (20th) (Beiping) Ye Qi said, "I have Yan's personal letter with me, asking me to go to Hong Kong to deliver it to Wang in person, urging him to go north as soon as possible. I will go south as soon as there is a ship in Tianjin, and I will definitely urge Wang to come together." (20th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Bing delegation repeatedly urged key Party affairs personnel to quickly form a government, otherwise it would hinder the politics of all parties and affect military affairs. In short, organizing a government and exercising power is legal. (20th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhao Pilian said, "I hope that both parties will unite as soon as possible." (20th) (Beiping) Tonight, Mao Zuquan hosted a banquet for Zhao Pilian and Cao Zou Xie Fu in Huai Rentang. (20th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>On European Federation Plan</h3>
<p>General Opinions of Various Countries</p>
<p>British Attitude is Cold</p>
<p>Intention to Sneer and Mock</p>
<p>Germany Strongly Opposes</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 19th - British newspapers are buzzing with discussions about the abridged version of the French Foreign Minister Briand's United States of Europe plan and the speech by former Colonial Secretary Amery stating that Britain does not want to join. It is said that Amery is an opposition party to the current government and has no right to increase the national burden or speak on behalf of the country. However, regarding whether to accept this plan, the newspapers are mostly treating it with a cold attitude.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 18th - The French newspapers have mostly indignant comments on the speech given by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Florence yesterday. The organ of the Radical Socialist Party's commentary is particularly fierce, directly denouncing it as an order to raise troops, saying that Mussolini knew the content of Briand's federation outline when he spoke, and that his so-called sweet words, but better with long guns and cannons and warships, are probably aimed at this outline, so his speech is tantamount to declaring war on Briand. According to news from Rome, the Italian newspapers are ridiculing Briand's dream of self-confidence.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 19th - The German democratic newspapers mostly sympathize with Briand's European Federation plan, only commenting on the more important details. The national power newspapers are fiercely attacking it, denouncing it as an attempt by France to dominate the European continent. The communist newspapers are also strongly opposed, saying that its purpose is to unite European countries to resist Soviet Russia. In political circles, such as former Democratic Party member of the cabinet Keike, said that Germany's participation in this large federation must be conditional: (1) The current intolerable situation in the east must be corrected; (2) It does not hinder the possibility of future German-Austrian merger; (3) The minority issue should be discussed immediately and a permanent solution should be obtained. Raynbabai, a leading member of the Nationalist Party, said that Briand's plan originated from Bismarck, and he personally expressed his support and listed several issues, saying that they must have Germany's participation before they can be resolved satisfactorily.</p>

<h3>Crushing Indian Speech</h3>
<p>Fifty-Seven Newspapers Suspended</p>
<p>State Councilor Resigns in Anger</p>
<p>Chilam Mass Meeting Disbanded</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th - Indian Affairs Minister Benn said in the House of Commons today that the Indian government estimates that about 40 daily newspapers and 17 weekly and bi-weekly newspapers have been suspended in India since the promulgation of the Publication Act, but some of those that have been suspended are planning to publish again soon.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madras, 20th - Iil, a member of the Indian State Council, wrote to the Indian Governor, requesting to resign, opposing (1) detaining Gandhi without trial, (2) restoring the Publication Act, and (3) abusing violence against innocent non-violent resistance volunteers.</p>
<p>Reuters, Simla, 20th - Former legislative members Hans Laizhi and Halixin, both famous figures in Congress, were arrested in Cholundo yesterday for allegedly inciting unrest.</p>
<p>Reuters, Simla, 19th - A mass meeting near Chilam's Kara place today did not obey police orders to disband. The police planned to detain the leaders, and the crowd threw bricks at the police. The governor ordered to open fire, and the police managed to escape without loss. No one in the crowd was injured. Ninety-nine Sikh Hindus in Chilam marched in formation, intending to go from Amritsar to Northern Xia Hua to express sympathy to the Muslim Basang people and eliminate the long-standing resentment between the Basang and Sikh peoples, but all ninety-nine were arrested by the police on the way.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 19th - The Bombay government issued a bulletin today, stating the events that occurred in Xulapo from May 7th to 19th, saying that since the promulgation of martial law, there have been no incidents and no bullets have been fired. The current situation is extremely peaceful. The exact number of deaths and injuries of the rioters is not yet known, but according to private physicians, 13 have died and more than 30 have been injured. The police fired a total of 113 rounds of ammunition during the riots. The soldiers did not fire at first, but started shooting when the rioters' actions became more and more intense and it was clear that someone was directing them behind the scenes. The statements that an external police officer was tied up and burned alive, that the rioters gouged out the eyeballs of a police officer, and that two police officers were buried alive in a well are all untrue. The authorities hope that the missing police officers are still alive.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th - The Indian government issued a report for the week ending May 17th, stating that the most notable event this week was the tribal situation on the Northwest Frontier. Although there were signs of improvement, it was not yet stable. What is gratifying is that no tribe has any overall combat actions. The situation in the Northwest Frontier Province has improved due to the serious work of the authorities. This week was quieter. The Executive Committee of the Alahabatu People's Party recently passed measures such as not paying land tax and boycotting British goods, with the aim of making the government impossible. In order to achieve its goals, the mastermind does not hesitate to sacrifice India's existing and future interests. It is important to know that the government has set out its full power to stop this kind of action.</p>
<h3>Situation of the US Tariff Bill</h3>
<p>Senate Holds Vote</p>
<p>Most Obstacles Removed</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 19th - Most of the obstacles to the new tariff bill have been removed, so Senator Watson of the Senate Finance Committee announced today that the bill has sufficient votes in favor and is expected to pass. The Senate today abandoned the proposal for export tax refund vouchers by a vote of 43 to 41, and rejected the abolition of the president's right to conveniently change tariffs within certain limits by a vote of 43 to 42.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 19th - During today's Senate discussion of the new tariff bill, several Republican senators accused the Spanish and Swiss ambassadors of commenting on the bill in recent speeches. California Senator Chutrelage asked the President to negotiate with Switzerland to recall the ambassador, saying that his speech was tantamount to interfering in the internal affairs of the host country. Indiana Senator Watson said that the two ambassadors openly violated the United States' right to formulate tax laws because the new tariffs hindered their countries' commerce with the United States.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Naval Hegemony</h3>
<p>Britain Deliberately Tries to Limit American Warships at the London Conference</p>
<p>US Naval Advisor Reports to the Senate</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 19th - Rear Admiral Jones, naval advisor to the delegation attending the London Naval Conference, told the Senate Naval Affairs Committee today that the United States is deliberately trying to limit American warships to the minimum working limit, while seeking to increase the ships of its own country in other categories. Rear Admiral Jones also said that he personally preferred cruisers with eight-inch guns, but when he went to the London Conference as a naval advisor, he also wrote to the American delegation stating that in certain circumstances, cruisers with six-inch guns were superior. The committee then decided to ask the government to allow it to review Ambassador Dawes' secret report on the London Conference. Rear Admiral Jones also agreed to include his statement to the American delegation that day in the committee's records.</p>
<h3>Naval Issues and Japan</h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Makes Efforts to Seek Understanding</p>
<p>Dangerous Air Still Thick</p>
<p>Telegraphic News, Tokyo, 20th - The Finance Minister and Naval Minister plan to convene an informal meeting of military councillors in two or three days, inviting Admiral Togo, Marshal of the Navy, Admiral Okada, Chief of the Naval General Staff, and others to attend, explain the details of the London Conference in detail, and ask for understanding. However, the military is still extremely dissatisfied, and it is doubtful to what extent the Navy Minister's effort to gain understanding can succeed. It is rumored that when the Navy Minister met with Chief of the Naval General Staff Kato yesterday, Kato said that it was a pity that the government had not accommodated the intentions of the Naval General Staff, and that the Naval General Staff should carefully consider its attitude in the future.</p>
<p>Telegraphic News, Tokyo, 20th - The formal military councillor meeting is planned to be held after Full-Power Wakatsuki returns to the country, after the middle of next month. Judging from the current situation, although the Finance Minister and Naval Minister are making efforts to seek understanding, the intentions of the military are still strong, and the dangerous air is still thick. The noble house also attaches great importance to research associations and public opinion societies, and recently plans to invite the Finance Minister's full power to explain the ins and outs of the London Treaty's establishment. The military also insists on convening a formal military councillor meeting immediately, opposing the government's proposal to postpone the convening. Therefore, the situation in the next two or three days is most noteworthy.</p>
<p>Telegraphic News, Tokyo, 20th - Due to the return of the Finance Minister's full power, the arms reduction issue has once again become the center of discussion in all aspects. The editorials of Tokyo newspapers this morning are roughly as follows: The Tokyo Asahi said, "Those who have objections to the London Treaty are not only Japan. Even in the United Kingdom, Admiral Charles Lee and the Chairman of the Navy Committee Harry, and other members of the Upper House, mostly sing dissenting opinions about the amount of holdings. President Hoover is also busy with understanding movements. The air of opposition in the United Kingdom is also very strong. This is because all countries have made concessions to sign, but from the overall situation of international coordination, it is indeed not desirable. The United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan are in the same position of opposition, which is good material for approval and execution." The Central and Foreign Commercial News said, "It is a pity that the opinions of the Navy Minister and the military are conflicting. It is hoped that they can be resolved satisfactorily. The Ministry of Transport insists on absolute toughness on national defense, although it is not without merit, but it is the duty of the military to do its best to deal with the aftermath." The Jiji Shinpo said, "Regarding the use of surplus funds from arms reduction, the military strongly insists that they be used to expand the air force and supplement new weapons. After all, to what extent can the government lighten the burden on the people as stated? It is questionable. In this time of economic recession, seeking the stability of the national economic life under the foundation of national defense security is the most urgent task. When we compile the budget for next year, we should seriously monitor the government's policy."</p>
<h3>League of Nations Convenes</h3>
<p>Conference on the Unification of Bill of Exchange Law</p>
<p>Regarding Bills of Exchange and Bank Notes</p>
<p>Drafting International Treaties to Harmonize Continental Law</p>
<p>The World Society said, "The international conference convened by the League of Nations for the unification of bill of exchange law was held in Geneva on the 13th, chaired by Limburg of the Netherlands. The purpose of this meeting is that the legal systems of bills of exchange, payment orders, and bank notes currently adopted by various countries vary from country to country. In international commerce and trade, the inconveniences and obstacles faced by people of all countries are not few. This is because the unification of the above-mentioned legal systems aims to draft international treaties to harmonize various laws between continental laws (including Latin American countries). The solution to this problem is to promote commercial relations between the people of all countries. The business and financial circles of European and American countries are paying close attention to the convocation of this meeting. The meeting is based on the draft agreement drafted by the League of Nations Legal Committee as the basis for discussion. The case stipulates the issuance and manner of promissory notes and bank notes, annotations, acceptance, guarantee, payment, recourse rights, participation, copies, statutes of limitations for forgery, general rules, etc. What is particularly noteworthy is as follows: (1) On bills and bank notes, the debtor should sign by himself; (2) The issuance of unregistered bills is not recognized; (3) Limited to bills payable on sight and bills with a fixed payment period after sight, interest is attached. In addition, interest is not attached to bills; (4) In addition, new interpretations are being tested regarding payment and the creation of payment refusal certificates.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Lieutenant Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Cause Unknown</p>
<p>Telegraphic News, Tokyo, 20th - The No. 14 express train from Kobe on the Tokaido Line suddenly had Naval Lieutenant Eiji Kusakari, who was sitting in a second-class sleeping car, commit suicide with a short knife after passing Shizuoka Station at 2:00 AM on the 20th. He was discovered by an employee and was taken off the train at Numazu Station and sent to the nearby Chunche Hospital. He died of his injuries at 11:00 AM. No suicide note was found. The cause of suicide is unknown. Some say it was the result of weakness, while others say it was out of resentment over the results of the naval arms reduction conference. At present, there is no way to speculate.</p>
<h3>Malta Also Plans to Leave Britain</h3>
<p>Nationalist Party Controls General Election</p>
<p>British Governor-General Orders Postponement</p>
<p>London News - The general election in British Malta, originally scheduled for this month, was suddenly ordered to be postponed by the British Governor-General until after the "crisis of unrest" has passed. The date will be decided and announced by the Governor-General. The people were quite excited when they heard this announcement, but there were no incidents of resistance. As for the reason for the postponement, the prelate in power on the island declared that anyone who voted in favor of the Prime Minister or the Constitutional Party would commit a mortal sin that would not be extinguished after death. As a result, the Constitutional Party withdrew from the election. Therefore, the election situation was in the hands of the Nationalist Party, and the Nationalist Party, under the leadership of Michel, has always held the doctrine of making Malta secede from the British Empire, so the British Governor used this arbitrary trick. (World)</p>
<p>Note: Malta is not only the hub of the Mediterranean Sea, but also the thoroughfare to the East and West Oceans. Although it is a small island, its harbor is rarely matched in the world. The British Mediterranean Fleet uses this as its base.</p>

<h3>After the General Offensive Order: The Pinghan Railway</h3>
<p>Hankou dispatch: Since the changes involving Yan and Feng, the Central Army along the Pinghan Railway has received orders to prepare for departure. Subsequently, the General Headquarters of the Five Route Armies was reorganized into the Third Army Corps. Yang Hucheng's troops stationed in Nanyang were assigned to the central route. Xu Yuanquan, Xiao Zhichu, Fan Shisheng, Li Yunheng, and others stationed in northern Hubei were assigned to the left flank. Wang Jinyu, Shangguan Yunxiang, Hao Mengling, Zhao Guantao, Jiang Dingwen, and others stationed along the Pinghan Railway were assigned to the right flank. At that time, the Northwest Army stationed heavy troops in Zhengzhou, relying on the river for defense. Another force, including Zhang Wei, Suo Xi, Liu Mingtian, Jin Kai, and Nie Yuling, advanced from Jingziguan, harassing Zhushan, Zhuxi, Gucheng, Guanghua, Nanzhang, and other counties in northern Hubei. The situation in northern Hubei was extremely serious. Later, the left flank of the Central Army fought bravely, and the Northwest Army changed its strategy, withdrawing Zhang, Tian, Liu, and other troops to Yexian and Lushan, to cooperate with the Northwest Army on the Pinghan Railway. As a result, the situation in northern Hubei became stable, and the focus of the war shifted entirely to the Pinghan Railway. He Chengjun, the commander-in-chief of the Third Army Corps, seeing that northern Hubei was peaceful, ordered the troops to advance as opportunities arose, and completely concentrated the forces along the Pinghan Railway. He then departed from Wuhan on the 10th, initially stationed in Xinyang, and after inspecting the front lines, moved the headquarters of the Third Army Corps to Zhumadian for closer command. On the 16th of this month, he issued a general offensive order, and the Central Armies advanced on schedule and acted in unison. After Wang Jinyu's troops reached the vicinity of Linying, Fan Zhongxiu's troops raised flags to welcome them. Wang then led the main force across Linying and stationed in Xuchang. Xu Yuanquan, Xiao Zhichu, and others also reached Yexian and Xiangcheng. Although the cities had not yet fallen, all the surrounding fortresses had been occupied, and the two cities were being besieged. Yang Hucheng's troops occupied Li Qingdian within the Nantai territory on the 16th and prepared to march east. Nantai and Fangcheng were also recovered on the 17th. As for the Ninth Division under Jiang Dingwen, they went from Luohe to Zhoujiakou, flanking the Northwest Army troops on the Longhai Railway. This route concentrated forces earlier and has now joined the Second Army Corps. The air force is particularly strong, with the First and Third Air Squadrons, a seaplane squadron, and four fighter planes led by Zhang Huichang, all dispatched to the front lines. Initially, they were tasked with reconnaissance and occasional bombing. After the general offensive order was issued, Zhang Huichang re-equipped the force and divided it into three routes. The first route was the First Air Squadron, led by Squadron Leader Zhang Yougu. The second route was the Third Air Squadron, and the third route was the Seaplane Squadron, both led by their respective squadron leaders. Zhang Huichang personally commanded them to drop heavy bombs on Yexian, Xiangcheng, Lushan, Linru, Xuchang, Zhengzhou, Xinzheng, Yanshi, Luoyang, Tongxu, Weishi, Lanfeng, Fugou, Taikang, Xihua, and other places. At the same time, Gu Maolin, the captain of the Fifth Armored Train Battalion, used "Minsheng", "Xiping", and other armored trains to assist in the attack. Currently, the Northwest Army is under heavy pressure from the Central Army. Moreover, with Guide and Haoxian successively falling, they dare not move south rashly. Sun Liangcheng's troops on the first route and Ji Hongchang's troops on the third route, who were originally responsible for the front line of the railway, have gathered in the vicinity of Xinzheng. Pang Bingxun's troops on the second route and Song Zheyuan's troops on the fourth route, who were originally responsible for the left flank, are also tending to retreat to Zhengzhou and Luoyang. It is said that Feng Yuxiang secretly arrived in Zhengzhou on the 15th. Seeing this situation, in order to preserve his strength, he ordered Sun, Pang, Ji, and Song not to move rashly and instructed them to build strong fortifications for defense. It is said that He Chengjun, seeing the smooth progress of the war, has ordered the armies to converge on Zhengzhou in the shortest possible time. Since more than forty counties in southern Henan have fallen into a chaotic state of war, once Zhengzhou is captured, it will be possible to unite with the First and Second Army Corps, and the area south of the Yellow River can be completely recovered. Then, they can take Beijing and Tianjin to the north and monitor Tongguan and Shaanxi to the west. (May 19)</p>
<h3>Central Army Closes in on Bozhou</h3>
<p>The 10th Division Advances in Two Columns</p>
<p>Three Days and Nights of Fierce Fighting on the South Bank of the Wo River</p>
<p>Dispatch from the front-line reporter: Sun Dianying's troops, known as the Tenth Division, occupied Bozhou. Receiving supplies of weapons and ammunition from Feng and Yan, they were used as the main force to seize Anhui Province. The Central Army's Tenth Division advanced in two columns along the north and south banks of the Wo River from Guoyang. The commander of the left column, Brigadier General Jiang Fusheng of the 30th Brigade, led his troops and part of the 28th Brigade, launched an attack from Chengwenzhai on the morning of the 8th. The 59th Regiment attacked Zhang Dianqing's division of Sun's forces at Wei Caiyuan, and the 60th Regiment attacked the independent brigade of Zhang Xinliu's division and the mixed regiment of Zhaoqiao and Yue Xiangru at Zhang Xinliu. After several hours of fierce fighting, they successively defeated Zhang Xinliu and Zhaoqiao, capturing two mortars and countless luggage and supplies, and capturing more than a dozen officers. After the 59th Regiment surrounded Wei Caiyuan, they sent Li Ying to drive out the enemy at Dinggusi. As a result, the enemy's line of defense at the Zhao Wang River was occupied by the Central Army. On the 9th, they attacked the line of Leizhai, Li Xiaolou, and Nineteeen Li Gully. After dusk, fierce fighting began and continued until dawn. The next morning, Jiang Fusheng supervised his troops and launched a fierce attack on the enemy. The sound of artillery shook the sky, and the smoke of bullets obscured the view. They seized several villages in succession, advancing eight or nine miles. In the afternoon, they used hand grenades to attack the enemy's headquarters at Ren Dazhuang. At this point, the main force of Sun's army, the 79th and 2nd Divisions and all of Yue Xiangru and Ma Xiren's forces, collapsed completely and retreated to Bozhou. On the morning of the 11th, the entire left column of the Central Army advanced directly to the east, west, and south gates of Bozhou. In this battle, the two sides fought fiercely for three days and nights, engaging in more than a dozen hand-to-hand combats. Five regimental commanders and about a thousand officers and soldiers of Sun's army were killed. The Central Army also suffered four or five hundred casualties. Flesh flew everywhere, and corpses littered the field. It was an unprecedented fierce battle in northern Anhui. (May 12)</p>
<h3>Report from Xuzhou: Fierce Fighting Expected in Lanfeng</h3>
<p>Main Force of the Jin Army Concentrated East of Lanfeng</p>
<p>Dispatch from Xuzhou: According to news from the headquarters, Wan Xuancai's troops, who were trapped in Guide, sent representatives of local communities out of the city on the morning of the 16th to request Liu Zhi to suspend the attack. Liu immediately gave them until 4:00 PM that day to unconditionally surrender. When Wan's troops still did not give a satisfactory answer, the Central Training Division began the attack. That night, they occupied the outer city. On the 17th, they continued to attack. Wan's troops were exhausted and raised a white flag to indicate surrender. This (18th) afternoon, the Central Army occupied the inner city, confiscating over a thousand weapons. The captured soldiers are being temporarily held pending further handling. As a result, there are no more Wan's troops within the Central Army's defense line in eastern Henan.</p>
<p>After the Central Army occupied Liuhe and Ningling, they engaged in fierce fighting with Wan Xuancai's troops and part of the Jin Army west of Liuhe on the 17th. According to news from the headquarters, the Central Army's center has reached Minquan County and is advancing towards Lanfeng. However, Lanfeng is where the main force of the Jin Army is concentrated. The Jin Army has also established defensive fortifications in the Nei Huang Yejigang area east of Lanfeng. More fierce fighting is inevitable there. Furthermore, Guan Fuan's troops of the Jin Army in Kaocheng were defeated by the Central Second Division and retreated towards Lanfeng. The Second Division pursued and has passed the old Kaocheng. Gu Zhutong telegraphed that over 2,000 prisoners had been captured. According to their confessions, they were short of supplies, each person only being issued three rows of bullets, and were unwilling to fight. In the Luyi area, Sun Dianying's cavalry under Sun Changsheng was ambushed by the 21st Division. Sun was injured and fled. At the same time, Hu Jinshan, the leader of the Red Spears Society on the border between Henan and Anhui, joined forces with local militias to intercept Sun's troops. The 210th Division is now advancing towards Taikang. (May 18)</p>
<h3>Overseas Mail to Increase in Price</h3>
<p>Effective June 1st This Year</p>
<p>50% Increase for Letters and Parcels</p>
<p>Exemptions for Japan and Nanyang Ports</p>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation has decided to increase the price of overseas mail by 50% starting June 1st. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Background: Previously, due to the soaring price of gold, China's overseas mail fees were calculated based on silver prices, resulting in significant losses. To remedy this, the Ministry of Transportation drafted measures to increase prices and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for review and approval by the National Government. The National Government has now approved the proposal. The Ministry of Transportation has specifically instructed Liu Shufan, Director General of Posts, to notify the Universal Postal Union following legal procedures, explaining that China will increase the price of overseas mail by 50% starting June 1st and requesting that the Union inform its member states.</p>
<p>(2) Scope: In terms of region, the price increase only applies to mail sent to European and American countries. Hong Kong, Japan, Nanyang ports, Australia, and Africa are not included. In terms of mail classification, the increase only applies to letters and parcels. Express mail, registered mail, and insured mail will remain the same. Parcels sent to the United States are also temporarily exempt from the price increase due to treaty relations.</p>
<p>(3) Impact: Due to China's underdeveloped transportation facilities, overseas mail relies heavily on foreign services, incurring substantial freight costs annually. As a result, after offsetting income and expenses, there is an annual shortfall of approximately 2 million. The soaring price of gold in the past three years has undoubtedly increased the deficit. The price increase is expected to maintain a balance between income and expenses. According to statistics, Chinese citizens only send one-fifth of the overseas mail, so the impact of the price increase on the interests of the Chinese people is limited.</p>
<h3>Rampant Communist Bandits in Yangxin</h3>
<p>County Seat Recaptured, but Outskirts Remain a Bandit Stronghold</p>
<p>Yangxin Dispatch: Yangxin is the most rampant area for Communist bandits in southern Hubei. Communist bandits began to stir in the county in February and March of last year, initially seizing weapons from local defense units in Longshan, Fushou, Fengshan, and Daban towns. They gradually spread to Longgang, Wuhu, Yanxia, and other towns, as well as Feng'an Township near the county seat. In the interim, frequent mutinies occurred among the garrison troops, which not only failed to suppress the bandits but also increased their strength and emboldened them. After May and June, tragic incidents of murder and arson occurred daily in various townships. Good citizens in various places were unable to live at home and flocked to the county seat for refuge, leaving almost no space in the streets and alleys. After the 35th Division's Tan Regiment suffered a defeat in Fushou Town in October, the local Communist bandits became even more unbridled. They then colluded with over a thousand Red bandits led by Peng Dehuai to protect them. The bandits became increasingly rampant, burning, looting, and killing everywhere. The local people suffered the misery of being unable to live or die. The county government officials and most of the refugees were in this isolated city, constantly frightened by rumors and false alarms. Moreover, the 16th Independent Brigade's Wu Battalion was stationed in the county but had no combat capability. As a result, the Communist bandits captured the county seat. The county government and various agencies were burned to the ground, leaving not a single tile intact. Over a hundred people were massacred. The various tragedies were unbearable to witness. Fortunately, the New 22nd Division's Hu Regiment, upon hearing the news, rushed to the county seat day and night, repelled the bandits, and restored order. Now, places several miles away from the city are still occupied by Communist bandits. Except for a corner of the county seat, where the Hu Regiment's two battalions are stationed and able to maintain order, all places outside the city have become completely communist-controlled. Although the Hu Regiment's troops are more than sufficient for defense, they lack the strength to carry out a full-scale suppression plan. It is currently the busy season for spring planting, and the genuine farmers in the area are eagerly hoping that the troops will go down to the villages to suppress the bandits. If the government does not send more capable troops to assist in the suppression and eliminate the bandit scourge soon, the farmers in various places will not be able to plant in time, and there will be no hope for the autumn harvest, making the local bandit situation even more difficult to manage.

<h3>Zhu and Mao Flee to Southern Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Chaozhou, Puning, and Huilai Encircling Local Communists</p>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: This month, Zhu and Mao's Communist bandits fled from Huichang's Junmenling in Jiangxi to Xunwu. A portion of them have entered Xingning's Luogang in Guangdong Province. Luogang, also known as Luofusi, is only 90 li away from Xingning County. The news spread, causing great panic in the upper reaches of the Han River. Wealthy merchants from Chaozhou and Shantou who had branches in Xingning rushed back to Shantou and telegraphed various ports to stop handling goods. At the same time, local Communist forces in Fengshun, led by Gu Taicun and Li Mingguang, numbering about 2,000, captured Wuhua's Meilin and Anliu. County Magistrate Wei escaped and returned to Wuhua City. Since Wuhua and Xingning are very close, rumors spread that Xinghua had fallen. The 8th Brigade Commander Mao Weisheng, stationed in Meixian, urgently dispatched the 15th and 16th Regiments to block the advance. The 15th Regiment's Liao Qirong Battalion arrived in Xingning City on the 9th and immediately went to Wudu in Hua to suppress the bandits. It is said that they engaged the Communist bandits in Maobugang and defeated Gu and Li's forces. The 16th Regiment also went to Luogang. Seeing the arrival of government troops, the remnants of Zhu and Mao's forces quickly retreated towards Sannan. Currently, the people in the upper reaches of the Han River are slightly calmer. Chaikuangbao near Shekeng has been oppressed by bandits and turned into a red area, cutting off communication with the outside world. Recently, the bandits have run out of food, and the bandit leaders have led the bandits to various villages to extort grain for survival. Local bandits in Songyuan recently robbed cargo ships on the Mei River again. On the 9th, three cargo ships docked at Aoxia in Songkou were completely looted by bandits from Songyuan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Fengshun's Communist bandits, led by Gu Taicun this month, invaded Wu.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Hua. On one hand, they gathered at Matou to attack Huangjin City, located in the lower reaches of the Han River. On the 9th, they engaged in fierce fighting with local military police all day. On the other hand, a force of about a thousand, gathered in Baixi, Sanmenkeng, Muzidong, Tieken, and other places, led by Zhu Huanting and Zhu Shaolian, joined forces with Li Mingguang, remnants of Zhu and Mao's forces. On the 9th, they launched an uprising in Daxiekeng Township in the fourth district of the county. The township's militia, led by Wu Changbin, began the attack at about 4:00 PM. The bandits had several white horses and red flags covering the sky, making a grand display. Wu Changbin launched over ten attacks before breaking through, killing over a dozen bandits on the spot, and seizing a large flag of the fourth branch of the Copper North Township Farmers' Association, several guns, and numerous propaganda materials. The Lan surname's house in the township had three buildings burned down by the bandits, and Peng Si was abducted. The bandits fought until nightfall and dispersed on their own.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Chen Guanghan Guard Regiment sent by Guangzhou to Chaozhou and Shantou landed in Hailufeng's Shanwei and suppressed local Communist forces along the way. Over a thousand Communist bandits in Lufeng have fled to Puning's Nanshan Motian Stone to become bandits. The Chen Regiment is tracking and suppressing them. On the 10th, they arrived in Huilai City. A portion of them stationed in Kui Tan Longjiang. Over a hundred representatives from Huilai's various agencies went out of the city to the Cijiao Nunnery, over two li away, to welcome them. It is said that Chen Regiment's arrival was ordered by the Eighth Route Army Headquarters to join forces with the 7th Brigade's Huang Fuhua Battalion to suppress Communist bandits in Chaozhou, Puning, and Huilai counties. It is estimated that there are about three or four thousand Communist bandits in these three counties, scattered in the mountainous villages of Linzhao Township, Lin Zheshi, Hongkou She, Chizhu Ya, Yuanshanzai, Niujiaoqiu, and other villages bordering Chaozhou, Puning, and Huilai. After arriving in Huilai, Chen Regiment sent Li Regiment to Chaozhou to meet with County Magistrate Huang Zongxian and discuss bandit suppression plans. The various companies and platoons of the 16th Regiment and the Guard Regiment stationed in Chaozhou also set out from Chendian Market, Liangying Market, Houkeng, Shalong, Heping, Yuxia, and other routes to encircle the area. Zheng Zeshi and Chen Junping led over three thousand members of the militia, departing from the Hekou recuperation area. They should be able to reach their destination today. (May 15)</p>
<h3>Situation in Western Fujian Gradually Easing</h3>
<p>Communist Rebels All Defeated</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The situation in western Fujian was quite tense previously because the mutineers Zhou Zhiqin and Wei Chu's forces were harassing Changting and Shanghang, and Communist bandits under Deng Yigang and Ruan Shan were entrenched in Longyan and Yongding. It was also rumored that these mutineers and Communist bandits would join forces. The Provincial Party Headquarters and the Provincial Government repeatedly telegraphed the National Government Headquarters for emergency assistance, requesting that capable troops be sent to Fujian to suppress the bandits to prevent local devastation. The headquarters replied by telegraph, designating Zhang Zhen's division to coordinate with local militias to encircle and suppress the Communist bandits, and Jin Handing's division to coordinate with Lu Xingbang's division to attack the mutineers from both sides, with the goal of eliminating them within a specified time. After receiving the telegram, Zhang and Lu immediately complied with the order and mobilized their troops. Currently, the Communist bandits in Longyan have been defeated by Liu Liebo's militia from Shizhong, assisted by Zhang Division. The county seat has been recaptured. Deng Yigang led the remnants to flee to Huishi in western Longyan. The Communist bandits in Yongding have also been defeated by the Lushiaba militia, assisted by Zhang Division. Ruan Shan led the remnants to retreat to Hulei, their old lair. Currently, the militias in various districts of Longyan and Yongding are joining forces to prepare for the encirclement of Huishi and Hulei. It is said that the Communist bandits plan to flee to the border area between Fujian and Guangdong provinces to avoid capture. Zhang Division has telegraphed the troops stationed in Guangdong to intercept them. As for Zhou and Wei's mutineers, after fleeing from Jiangxi to Fujian, they attempted to collude with the two regiments of the Provincial Defense Army stationed in Liancheng and Ninghua, led by Huang Yuequan and Lu Xinming, to invade northern Fujian. However, Lu Division mobilized troops from Shaowu, Jianou, and other areas to Jianning, Guihua, and Yongan to block them, preventing the mutineers from succeeding. Moreover, since their objectives differed from those of the Communist bandits, cooperation was impossible. They retreated from Shanghang, Liancheng, and Ninghua, gathering in Changting, and then retreated from Changting to Ruijin and Shicheng in Jiangxi. Currently, there are no traces of mutineers in Shanghang, Liancheng, and Ninghua. However, the mutineers in Changting have not completely withdrawn, so transportation is still blocked. However, the situation has eased considerably compared to ten days ago. (May 16)</p>
<h3>Establishment of Jinan's First Hydroelectric Plant</h3>
<p>Jinan's First Hydroelectric Plant was founded by the Department of Construction. The process of its establishment and the details of the hydroelectric plant are worth recording, so a summary is provided below:</p>
<p>Origin of the Plant Site: Shandong's rivers mostly originate from high mountains and have great hydropower potential. Some people have utilized it for many years, mostly using water mills. For example, the Wu River and Xiaofu River in Hengtai, and the Xiu River in Zhangqiu, each have twenty or thirty water mills. Jinan is known as the City of Seventy-Two Springs, with abundant spring water. Springs such as Black Tiger Spring, Agate Spring, White Stone Spring, Pipa Spring, and South Pearl Spring outside the southeast corner of the city converge and flow north. The terrain outside the East Gate is very low. An old river dam was built to store water, and the water flows under the dam, forming a silky waterfall. The force is very strong. Over a hundred years ago, someone established a water mill here, using the force of the rushing river water to drive a wooden wheel, which had a stone mill on top to rotate it. It could grind 450 catties of wheat per day, working twenty hours a day. The property is now owned by the Hongjialou Catholic Church. The Shandong Department of Construction began surveying in October of the 18th year, planning to establish the First Hydroelectric Plant. They consulted with the Catholic Church to borrow the land. The water flow outside the East Gate was measured to be 4.7 feet, with a flow rate of 40 cubic feet per second. Measures were taken to increase the water source, and the dam was raised by one foot, bringing the water head to 5.7 feet. It was estimated that it could generate 33-34 horsepower. If the water turbine's efficiency is 75%, it can produce 25 working horsepower. If the generator's efficiency is 80%, it can generate 20 horsepower, or 15 kilowatts of electricity.</p>
<p>Outline of the Project: The foundation of the project was based on a 1-2-4 cement mix suitable for the terrain. The water turbine used a reaction turbine in the water. The main components were four: 1. Volute casing, 2. Inlet guide, 3. Impeller, 4. Shaft support. A TBT DC generator from Henry &amp; Company was installed, with a power of 14.7 kilowatts, a voltage of 110-115 volts, and a rotation speed of 1150 revolutions per minute. The power lines were run from the plant site through the New East Gate, past the Charity Association on Hou Street, to the Department of Construction, a distance of 500 meters. The entire project was completed in April of the 19th year. After completion, the first test supplied electricity to the Department of Construction lights, with excellent results. However, only one kilowatt was used, leaving surplus power that could be supplied to other agencies. Plans are underway to install batteries to store daytime electricity. The total project cost was 6,758 yuan and 82 cents.</p>
<p>Estimated Benefits: The estimated benefits of the First Hydroelectric Plant are divided into two parts: 1. Expenses: The operating expenses are approximately 6,760 yuan. With an annual interest rate of 1%, it would be 676 yuan per year. Machine depreciation, at 1/10, is approximately 676 yuan per year. Internal plant expenses are 100 yuan per month, 1,200 yuan per year. The total annual expenses are 2,552 yuan. 2. Income: The Department of Construction's 100 lights generate an average monthly electricity fee of 150 yuan, totaling 1,800 yuan per year. Assuming the plant generates 5 kilowatts, it can supply 300 lights, generating a total annual income of 5,400 yuan. Comparing income and expenses, the annual net profit is 2,850 yuan. This only accounts for the nighttime lighting of the Department of Construction and two other agencies. If batteries are used to store daytime electricity for nighttime use, the benefits would be doubled. If the water level rises in summer and autumn, increasing power generation, and the surplus electricity is used to power electric fans, car batteries, etc., the expected benefits would be even greater. Currently, about ten thousand people visit the site daily. The project was managed by Zhang Hanying, a technical expert at the Department of Construction, and Zhang Junsen, a technician.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department Orders Counties to Conduct Price Stabilization Sales</h3>

<h3>Wuhu Urgent News</h3>
<p>In Fanchang County and Hanshan County, which are connected to Wuhu, bandits are rampaging in areas such as Yuncang. The Wuhu garrison regiment has dispatched troops to suppress them separately. Yesterday, the regimental headquarters received a report from Deputy Zhao of the Yuncang camp, stating that the bandits in that area were severely attacked by the troops, and the bandits, unable to withstand the attack, have fled towards Digang. They are currently being pursued. According to reports, Regiment Commander Lü has not only dispatched additional troops to block them in Digang, but also ordered the troops heading to Fanchang to encircle them.</p>
<p>Residents from the surrounding villages have publicly elected representatives Yang Bingzhi and Yu Zhengqing to petition the county party headquarters, the county government, and the Wuhu People's Food Maintenance Association, requesting the establishment of rural subsidized grain bureaus in suitable locations in the surrounding villages. It is said that the rural food panic is due to having money but nowhere to buy. However, the subsidized grain association believes that establishing additional subsidized grain bureaus would result in significant losses in rice prices, and a method for compensating these losses must be devised first. An emergency meeting has been scheduled for tomorrow to discuss solutions.</p>
<p>The Jiangxi warship stationed in Wuhu received orders to return to Nanjing at 5:30 this morning to refuel before sailing to Anqing for defense. The Chu Guan warship originally stationed in Anqing will sail to Nanjing after the Jiangxi warship arrives.</p>
<p>Due to the rice shortage in various counties in southern Anhui, they are purchasing foreign rice from Shanghai to implement subsidized grain sales. The Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce has specially formed a People's Food Relief Association to purchase foreign rice for the counties and has requested that the Sanbei Merchants and Two Companies reduce the freight costs for transporting the subsidized rice. Recently, a telegram from Yu Hede and Cui Xiangsen of the Sanbei Company replied that the freight costs for transporting subsidized rice by the company's ships will be calculated at half price from now on.</p>
<p>Lei Biji, secretary of the county party headquarters, and three other staff members had a major conflict with the National Cinema yesterday due to some reason. Lei and the other three were severely injured and sent to the hospital for treatment after forensic examination at the court. Two people from the National Cinema also sustained minor injuries. The military police investigation office has ordered the cinema to suspend performances pending resolution. (18th)</p>

<h3>Record of the Destruction of the New Jiangsu Newspaper Office</h3>
<p>The New Jiangsu Newspaper Office, which has been published for less than two years, is the newspaper with the highest circulation in the provincial capital. On the 12th of this month, it published a news report that "Military Police Caused Trouble in the Park and Were Detained." Soldiers from the First Regiment of Military Police stationed in the town were very dissatisfied after reading the newspaper. They first ordered the Seventh Branch of the Public Security Bureau to send a letter to the newspaper to correct the report and then sent three platoon leaders to the newspaper to question them, demanding that the proofreader be handed over. The newspaper refused. On the afternoon of the 17th, Chen Buyun, the commander of the First Regiment, sent a letter to the newspaper questioning them and demanding a reply within one day. Tang Xiuping, a staff member of the regiment's party department, arrived at the newspaper that evening to mediate. On the afternoon of the 18th, the newspaper sent someone to the regiment's party department to meet with Tang and agreed to (1) send a letter of apology and (2) the newspaper would correct the report again. After the newspaper fulfilled its promises, more than a dozen armed military police suddenly swarmed into the newspaper office at about 3:00 p.m. yesterday (the 19th). They did not find the manager, so they cursed and beat the staff, smashed all the items in the business department, and overturned the typesetting rack before leaving. The editors of the newspaper immediately drove to the provincial party department and the provincial government to report the incident. The provincial party department sent a telegram to the central government for instructions on how to handle the matter. The newspaper was severely damaged and could not be published as usual, only issuing a small extra.</p>
<h3>Yancheng Sends Representatives to the Province to Request Funds</h3>
<p>Yancheng in Jiangbei has suffered from continuous famine. The provincial government has decided to suspend the collection of the winter tax for the 18th year and only collect the upper tax according to the 30% reduction policy of the third year of the Republic of China. No transfers will be allowed, and the funds will be used exclusively for local maintenance expenses. However, due to the famine, nine out of ten households are empty, and very few people go to the treasury to pay the taxes, making it impossible to maintain the party and government agencies and education throughout the county. Therefore, representatives Xu Peide, Mao Jiapeng, Tang Wan臣, and Zhang Jian were publicly elected to come to the province to petition, requesting the allocation of provincial funds for relief. The local government expenses are only more than 13,000 yuan per year, while the expenditures reach more than 60,000 yuan, resulting in annual deficits. The budget for the 19th year cannot be established, and the provincial government is requested to find a way to thoroughly rectify the finances of Yancheng County.</p>

<h3>Tragic News of a Rickshaw Driver Gouging Out Eyes Due to Adultery</h3>
<p>It is tragically reported that Wang Si, a rickshaw driver living in front of the Guanyi Post Office outside the South Gate, led neighbors early on the 19th to tie up Zhang, a man from Pixian County, gouged out his eyes with lime, and randomly stabbed his eyeballs with needles. The injuries were very serious. Zhang was then tied up and abandoned near the Yin锭 Bridge south of the Jinghui Temple, claiming that Zhang would be killed that evening. It is heard that Wang's wife had an affair with Zhang. A few days ago, Wang's wife went out and returned on the evening of the 18th, forcing her husband to give her money and resorting to violence, hence the tragedy that occurred early on the 19th. It is now heard that the victim has filed a complaint with the authorities.</p>

<h3>Provincial Commissioner Comes to Cheng to Collect Urgent Taxes</h3>
<p>Due to an urgent need for funds, the Department of Finance has specially commissioned Sun Shao to come to Cheng to collect 10,000 yuan in urgent taxes and 3,000 yuan in deed taxes. Director Shen of the Finance Bureau, because it is the slack season, ordered Xing Bantang and others, the supervisors of the Qingyang, Qinnan, and Qiaozhi townships, to pay the 80,000 yuan in arrears of rice for the 17th year and silver for the 18th year in large quantities before the 24th of this month to meet the quota.</p>
<h3>A Quarrel Over Jealousy Leads to a Fatality</h3>
<p>Cai Liangcai's daughter Quanmei, 22 years old, from outside the Beiwai Gate, worked as a female worker in the fine yarn room of the Liyong Yarn Factory. Unable to adapt to the life there, she gradually became romantic and secretly led the life of a nymphomaniac. Last year, she became close to Hu Yongde, a runner for the Feng Taiyuan Money Shop, and rented a small house in Qi's house in the Wumiao Lane in the South Street. Recently, during the Changming opera performances, the two often went to watch the opera, which greatly displeased Hu's wife, Shen. Inevitably, jealousy flared up, and she repeatedly went to Cai's place to quarrel and smashed the items in the house. Cai Quanmei, provoked by this, secretly swallowed several coins of raw opium on the evening of the 18th and died of poisoning on the morning of the 19th. Later, after her mother Yin and her brother Longquan and others discussed the matter of the fatality with the Hu family, Song Renjie and others negotiated in Yiwei, ordering Hu to compensate Cai's mother Yin 400 yuan.

<h3>Bandits Attempt to Attack the Port But Are Repelled</h3>
<p>On the night of the 15th, about a thousand bandits divided into four routes to attack the Lu Port. At that time, the sixth and tenth squads of the county police happened to arrive at the port from the city. They joined forces with the security regiment of the district and the fourth squad of the驻警 to meet the attack separately. After three hours of contact, the bandits were unable to support themselves and began to flee in different directions. Several dozen bandits were killed and many were injured in this battle. Liang, the squad leader of the sixth squad, was injured. After the bandits fled, they arbitrarily set fire to the Bojiawan and Dingjiazhuang and other places, massacring farmers and detouring to Ban泾 to burn down the temporary office of the public security bureau.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<h3>Bandits Withdraw from Yongan Town</h3>
<p>Yongan Town, which is bordered by the three counties of Yangzhou, You, and Tai, was occupied by bandits on the morning of the 16th. Upon receiving the news, all three counties sent military police to suppress them. They engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits until dawn the next day. Fortunately, the provincial public security team on the water swept with machine guns, and the bandits were unable to support themselves and began to withdraw from Yongan Town one after another. A part of them fled towards Nansongzhuang in the county. The military police in this county have heard that they are already tracking and suppressing them.</p>
<h3>Jingjiang</h3>
<h3>Robbers Set Fire, Kidnap People, and Record the Shelling of the Xiegong Bridge in the Zhua Shan Area</h3>
<p>On the 17th, a large number of robbers, about 80 people, arrived near the Xiegong Bridge in the Zhua Shan area and kidnapped the grandson of Miao Yixian and the sons of Wang Jieren and Chen Yuanlong. Their whereabouts are still unknown. Also, the Yongding Nunnery of the Silai Nunnery was destroyed by fire by bandits at dusk on the 16th. Three shops of Liu Guozhen were also affected. There were about 40-50 bandits.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<h3>Spring Silkworm Harvest Less Than 50%</h3>
<p>The silkworm reports from the four townships of Huzhou County are all due to unfavorable weather. Therefore, many of them die on the mountain shed after clustering. On average, only 40% of the six counties of Huzhou have been harvested. The southern townships of various filatures opened the earliest, with a price of 50 yuan per dan. Because the goods are not prosperous, the price is as high as 60 yuan, but they still cannot be sold smoothly. In the northern townships of Zhili and Yigao, the price has risen to 68 yuan. In the western townships of Yangjiabu and Xicangqiao, the price is as high as 60 yuan. Meixi only opened yesterday. Although the filatures in various places are competing to collect at high prices, the silkworm production is poor. There is a price but no goods, so each filature cannot collect enough. The opening of the silk filatures in this city has not yet been determined. It is expected to be in the early part of the first month. The new silk has already entered the market, but there is not much. The highest price is 52 yuan per 100 taels.</p>
<h3>Bandits Rob Cocoons in Villages</h3>
<p>In the Xiazhuang Village, about seven miles away from Hejiabu in the western township of this city, seven or eight bandits suddenly came at about 9:00 p.m. the day before yesterday. Each of them carried guns and went to the four homes of Mai Yu Fuchun and others, and robbed all the cocoons they had collected.</p>
<h3>Two Children Suddenly Disappear</h3>
<p>An Renshan's son, 11 years old, and a child from the same residence surnamed, 12 years old, in Xiaoshi Lane in this city, went to the Luotuo Bridge River to look for Renshan after dinner last night. Unexpectedly, they did not return. When Renshan returned home, he saw that his son had not returned, so he searched everywhere, but there was no news. Later, he inquired at the homes of various relatives and friends, but there was no trace of them.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<h3>Kiln Owner Wu Guoqing Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Wu Guoqing, a kiln owner in Liuhe浜, Qianyao Town, in this county, has a well-to-do family and has long been coveted by bandits. Last night, more than ten bandits suddenly came, carrying quick weapons, and broke into the gate, dragged Wu from the bed, and kidnapped him to extort a large sum of money for ransom.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<h3>Literacy Movement Propaganda Conference</h3>
<p>The Xiaoshan City Literacy Movement Propaganda Conference was convened on the 19th in accordance with provincial orders, and various agencies were gathered at the People's Sports Field.

<h3>County Magistrate Accused of Abuse of Power Files an Appeal</h3>
<p>Shen Zengfeng, a party member from the eastern township of Xiaoshan County, was previously detained by the county government for ten days and was later released by the county party headquarters. After being released from prison, Shen accused Du Shihua, the county magistrate, of violating party discipline and abusing his power. He filed a lawsuit with the County Court Prosecutor's Office, accusing him of dereliction of duty. The prosecutor ruled that he should not be prosecuted. Now, Shen Zengfeng is dissatisfied with the county prosecutor's ruling. In addition to submitting a request to the Supervision Committee of the County Party Headquarters for disciplinary action, he has filed an appeal with the Prosecutor's Office of the Higher Court and has submitted a statement to the County Court. It is heard that the County Court has submitted all the files of the case to the Higher Prosecutor's Office for review.</p>

<p>In order to promote the construction of the city, the Ningbo Municipal Government has decided to use the pier donation as collateral to borrow a large sum of 100,000 yuan from the Ningbo General Chamber of Commerce. The General Chamber of Commerce convened a temporary meeting of the executive committee members and industry leaders at 3:00 p.m. on the 18th. More than 20 people, including Lin Qinxiang, attended. After discussion, it was generally agreed that borrowing 100,000 yuan was a large sum and that it would be necessary to wait until each leader had contacted each industry before a solution could be found.</p>
<h3>Chief Prosecutor Zheng Takes Office</h3>
<p>Chen Beisan, the chief prosecutor of the Yin County Local Court Prosecutor's Office, has been transferred to serve as the chief prosecutor of the Jiangning Local Court. The vacancy he left has been filled by Zheng Feng, the current chief prosecutor of the Qu County Branch Court, appointed by the Department of Judicial Administration.

<p>This Year's Competition</p>
<p>Will Still Use Far Eastern Rules</p>
<p>| Agreement Reached by China, Japan, and the Philippines |</p>
<p>| China Objects to Using World Rules, Resulting in Agreement |</p>
<p>Japan Sports Association Initially Proposed Using World Rules This Year</p>
<p>China Objected and Then Agreed to Continue Using Far Eastern Rules</p>
<p>However, the Japan Athletic Federation Firmly Requested Using World Rules</p>
<p>Now, the Three-Country Committee Has Reluctantly Agreed</p>
<p>Tokyo United Press dispatch, 20th: A dispute has arisen between the organizer of the Far Eastern Games, the Japan Sports Association, and the Japan Track and Field and Aquatic Federation regarding the rules to be used for the games. The Track and Field Federation issued a statement at the meeting of the China, Japan, and the Philippines Committee held at the Japan Youth Association at 7:00 PM on the 19th, stating, "We reluctantly acknowledge the use of Far Eastern rules for this year's games." Due to this statement, no records from this year's games will be recognized as world records. It is reported that the reason for this is that the Japan Sports Association negotiated with China before the Chinese athletes departed, regarding the issue of using new world sports rules for this year's games. However, after receiving China's objection, it did not consult with the relevant parties and unilaterally granted China's wishes, deciding to adopt the Far Eastern rules, thus causing the dispute.</p>
<p>Tokyo Dentsu dispatch, 20th: Regarding the track and field rules for the Far Eastern Games, the Japan Sports Association and the Chinese side reached an agreement to use Far Eastern rules. However, the Track and Field Federation, which had advocated for international rules, is quite dissatisfied with this decision and will reportedly express its views after the games are over.</p>
<p>Tokyo dispatch, 20th: Regarding the adoption of competition rules for the Far Eastern Games, the notification that international rules would be adopted for this year's games was only received this year. To adopt these rules, a considerable period of practice and preparation is necessary. If we had been notified earlier, we would have gladly agreed. Therefore, we propose adopting international competition rules starting from the next games.</p>
<p>Tokyo special dispatch, 20th: This year's games will continue to use Far Eastern rules. The Japan Track and Field Association is now criticizing the Japan Sports Advancement Association for adopting the rules without first consulting them. The Association believes it is regrettable because new records set under these rules will not be accepted by the World Games.</p>

<h3>Tatung University Adds a Gymnasium</h3>
<p>Tatung University, since its founding in the first year of the Republic [1912] has now been nineteen years. Talents emerge in large numbers, and the university is known far and wide especially for mathematics and science. Therefore, each year upon graduation famous schools across the country compete to recruit its graduates. The school did not emphasize physical education much five or six years ago. After hiring physical education specialist Sun Hebin to guide the school, every effort has been made to promote various sports. As a result, students are also encouraged to engage in practice. However, the location of the sports field is low-lying, and the road administration in the Nanshi area is not perfect. Ditches are sometimes blocked. Every time there is heavy rain, the area becomes a vast expanse of water, turning into a swamp. Recently, the university has requested the Public Works Bureau to find a way to dredge the ditches inside and outside the school, so that there will be no more water accumulation even in heavy rain. At the same time, faculty and students have jointly launched a fundraising campaign to add a gymnasium, so that they can practice sports on time even in rainy weather to increase their physical strength. The drawings have already been completed and it is estimated that it will cost about 20,000 yuan. Construction is planned to begin during the summer vacation this year.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>Issues a Circular Regarding the Learning and Teaching of Zhuyin Symbols</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, upon instruction, issues a circular to the Education Departments and Bureaus of all provinces and cities regarding the learning and teaching of Zhuyin symbols. The circular states that it has received instructions from the Executive Yuan, which state that the Executive Yuan has received instructions from the National Government, which state that the National Government has received a letter from the Central Executive Committee: "Upon investigation, China's education is backward, and illiteracy accounts for more than 80% of the national population, which is the greatest shortcoming of the nation. Therefore, the Primary Working Guidelines formulated by the Party's Second Session, 197th Standing Committee, took the literacy campaign as the top priority. However, since its promulgation, it has not been fully implemented. Examining Chinese characters, there are many advantages, but the disadvantage is the lack of phonetic notation, which is inconvenient for children and illiterate people to learn initially. Therefore, Japanese kana, which assists Chinese characters, has become the best popular tool and is more effective than European and American phonetic alphabets. Ancient methods of phonetic notation, such as 'read as,' 'direct sound,' and 'fanqie,' are all constrained by categories and tend to be complex, making them unsuitable for simple phonetic notation. The simplest phonetic notation is to determine several consonant elements and several vowel elements, with a total number of only a few dozen, making it extremely easy to learn. The phonetic alphabet previously issued by the Ministry of Education uses this method. Its organization and standardization of phonology are superior to kana. However, its function is only to annotate the pronunciation of characters or the pronunciation of words and is only suitable for phonetic notation. It is not suitable for creating characters. Calling it an alphabet is misleading, so it should be changed to Zhuyin symbols to match the name with the reality. It is only for phonetic notation and not for creating characters. Therefore, there is no need to overly reduce the number of symbols or set up many spelling rules. For advanced learning and important contracts, the distinction between the tones of the sounds and the similarities and differences in the meanings should still be the responsibility of Chinese characters, and there is no need to add such distinctions to the Zhuyin symbols. In this way, only a simple few dozen symbols can be learned in three days and can be used as a teacher. The illiterate can graduate in a maximum of ten days. Moreover, these few dozen symbols can be used to annotate the national pronunciation, the local pronunciation, and the pronunciation next to the characters. They can also be used alone to annotate the spoken language. They are convenient and can annotate any sound and any language, giving popular education the most affordable and fastest effect. If the Party headquarters get it, they can use the power of pen and ink to publicize the doctrine to the majority of illiterate people. If government officials get it, they can receive phonetic documents and post phonetic announcements from illiterate people, thus greatly improving public understanding. Teachers and students in the education field can use it with very little time and effort to instruct their mothers, sisters, maids, workers, and friends. If all the knowledge circles in the country mobilize and work hard to promote it, following the example of Japan, where being able to read popular kana-annotated books and newspapers is considered literacy, it will not be difficult to increase the literacy rate from 20% to 70 or 80% in a short time. This Association believes that phonetic notation is the most effective tool for literacy campaigns and should be vigorously promoted. Therefore, at the 88th Standing Committee meeting on the 21st of this month, it was decided to change the name of the phonetic alphabet to Zhuyin symbols and to determine the following three promotion methods:</p>
<p>"(1) Order the party members and personnel of each party to adopt it to increase the convenience of publicizing the party's ideology."</p>
<p>"(2) Inform the National Government to order personnel of all agencies to memorize it uniformly to help understand the sufferings of illiterate people."</p>
<p>"(3) Instruct the Ministry of Education to order all levels of educational institutions, teachers and students to learn and teach it, and work together to help adult education easily carry out."</p>
<p>"Except for the first item, which has already been ordered by the Association to be obeyed, all other items should be requested from the government to issue separate orders to be obeyed. In addition, the pronunciation of Zhuyin symbols should be compiled by the Ministry of Education into a booklet for learning and teaching, submitted to the Central Government for approval, and then issued separately for implementation within a specified period. It should also be sent to the Ministry of Education to compile a booklet on the pronunciation of Zhuyin symbols for learning and teaching and send it to the Yuan for submission for approval." Therefore, we should obey and, in addition to replying by letter and issuing separate orders, we urgently order you to obey and forward it to your subordinates to obey and report the situation. We also instruct the Ministry of Education to compile a booklet on the pronunciation of Zhuyin symbols for learning and teaching and submit it for verification. This order, etc. Therefore, we should obey and, in addition to issuing separate orders, we will order the Ministry to forward it to its subordinates and educational institutions at all levels to obey and compile a booklet on the pronunciation of Zhuyin symbols for learning and teaching and send it to the Yuan for submission for approval." Therefore, we should obey and, in addition to organizing a Zhuyin symbol promotion committee by the Ministry and ordering the editorial office of the Ministry to edit a booklet on the pronunciation of Zhuyin symbols for learning and teaching for submission, we should forward the matters regarding the learning and teaching of the Ministry to all levels of educational institutions and teachers and students. In addition to issuing separate orders, we will order the Bureau to obey and forward it to its subordinates to obey this order.</p>
<h3>Education Funds Must Not Be Used Arbitrarily</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government yesterday received an instruction from the Jiangsu Provincial Government stating, "For the purpose of compliance, it is found that education funding is the foundation of education, and guaranteeing its independence is stated in the political program. Most of the education funds in this province are special funds, and even if the name is not education funds, they have long been designated for educational purposes, listed in the budget for many years, and established as precedents, and should not be arbitrarily changed or misappropriated. Repeated orders have been issued on record. Now, it is found that some county bureaus are able to respect the orders and conscientiously abide by them, but some arbitrarily misappropriate funds, accumulate arrears, and fail to distribute them, leading to education riots. At the beginning of political tutelage, vigorously promoting education is extremely important, and education funds should not be misappropriated again, leading to the loss of the original intention of guaranteeing them. Therefore, it was resolved at the 292nd meeting of the committee that education funds in each county should be strictly ordered not to be misappropriated. In addition to issuing a circular, the county magistrate is hereby ordered to comply and also instruct the Director of the Finance Bureau to conscientiously comply. After this circular, if there is any further misappropriation without authorization, once discovered, severe punishment will be given. Be careful not to violate it!" The County Government has received the order and has already forwarded it to the Finance Bureau for compliance.</p>

<h3>Twelve Conclusions</h3>
<p>The proceedings of this National Education Conference and the various plans and programs discussed and resolved have been summarized above. After being approved by the Central Political Conference, they will enter the implementation stage. As for the value of the plan itself and the hopes for the implementation of the plan, there is a clear description in the declaration issued at the conference, which is excerpted below as the conclusion of this article: "The plans of this conference, although divided into ten chapters, are a whole when combined. The compilation of the plans is based on a comprehensive plan for national education, and strives to correct the shortcomings of each not communicating with each other. Therefore, each chapter and section is completely interconnected, and the spirit is also consistent throughout. We paid special attention to two points when resolving the full plan: one is to determine the period and steps based on factual needs, and the other is to strive to achieve the Three People's Principles based on the purpose of education. Regarding the first point, the spirit of the plan is to determine the priorities based on current and future needs, especially during the six-year period of political tutelage. We deeply feel that more than 80% of the illiterate people in the country and the majority of children who have not received educational opportunities are obstacles to the promotion of political tutelage and construction, and are also a major hindrance to the advancement of national culture. Therefore, during the six-year period of political tutelage, we will promote compulsory education and adult literacy education as much as possible, and consolidate and enrich secondary and higher education, first seeking to improve quality, and not hastily increasing quantity. It is natural that the most urgent needs at present should be to concentrate most of the material and spiritual strength on compulsory and adult literacy education, but in order to improve the level of culture, secondary and higher education are also in need of consolidation and enrichment at present. Therefore, these two aspects are not contradictory but complementary. Regarding the second point, in order to promote the development of people's livelihood, we emphasize science and experimentation in education at all levels and types, cultivate productive capacity, and develop vocational skills. In order to achieve universal civil rights, we emphasize civic training in social education and adult literacy education plans, and also emphasize discipline and the development of group cooperation habits in education at all levels, in order to lay the foundation for the exercise of the four powers. In order to fully achieve national independence, we emphasize the spirit of national independence in social education and school education, and stipulate that elementary education should not be left to foreigners. In order to realize nationalism and consolidate national sovereignty, we advocate the use of national power to support and promote overseas Chinese education and Mongolian and Tibetan education. In order to take into account the realization of the entire Three People's Principles education, we must target the majority of the people. Therefore, there are phased expansion provisions for social education facilities, and it has been resolved to promote the Zhuyin literacy movement, and the education authorities are requested to actively promote it.</p>
<p>"The above roughly describes the main spirit and focus of the plan decided by this conference. We believe that this twenty-year plan is a minimum plan based on facts, but in the situation of China's economic backwardness and lack of talent, it is indeed a very difficult task to implement this plan. Education workers must have a sense of responsibility, the Party and the government must use all their strength to lead and supervise, and the compatriots of the whole country must recognize it as a century-old plan and cooperate unanimously, so that there is hope for implementation on schedule. Therefore, we hope that education workers across the country should recognize that sacrifice is our duty, and that education is a cause of dedicating oneself to the country, not just a profession. Only by knowing this can we raise the spirit of the education sector and overcome all obstacles and difficulties, so that the entire plan can be realized from hardship and difficulty. We hope that the government can spare no effort to raise the necessary funds within the budget set by this plan, and implement the independence of guaranteed education funds, so that the existing consolidation and phased improvements will not be affected in the slightest. We also hope that the government will formulate and implement measures to protect education personnel, so that the implementation of the plan will not encounter stagnation and changes due to personnel changes, and that the education sector will no longer experience the phenomenon of principals changing with the responsible administrative personnel and teachers changing with the principals. Only in this way can there be people who can be responsible for implementing plans at all levels and in all stages with peace of mind, and there can be sufficient funds within the necessary limits. We also hope that compatriots across the country will recognize that the responsibility of education is not unique to those who run education. In China's current situation, education is indeed more important than any other cause. The ancients said that education and training should be carried out at the same time. Our situation is that without education, there will be no way to support. Others may think that it is better to get rich first and then educate. Our national conditions do not allow the education cause to be delayed or waited for any longer. Therefore, everyone in the country must regard education as their own responsibility, and then China can talk about education." (End)</p>

<h3>Teacher Suspected of Accepting Bribes to Seek Official Position</h3>
<p>According to the Education Society, it is said that someone claiming to be a student named Huang Mingxia recently mailed a letter from Tu's Primary School on North Zhijie Street in Changzhou to Chen Dezheng, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau in this city. The original letter is as follows: "To the esteemed teacher: With utmost respect, my relative, Wan Junxian, has obtained a county position or a public security post with 2,000 yuan of entertainment expenses. I have always heard that my teacher has a deep and close relationship with Chairman Ye. Therefore, I dare to write to you, sir, hoping that you can introduce him. If this is successful, then this amount will certainly be a contribution to my teacher's assets, and the matter can be accomplished quickly. I am at your service with the utmost urgency. I respectfully ask for your kind reply. Your student, Huang Mingxia, May 7." After receiving this letter, Chen was extremely angry and immediately replied with a stern rebuke. He also learned that the original letter from Huang said that if Huang Mingxia is indeed a student, he should not have forgotten the lesson of self-cleanliness. Now, his behavior is corrupt, and he dares to openly offer bribes and make plans for others under broad daylight. Now that the revolution has been established, how can politics be achieved through bribery? Huang Mingxia is ignorant of the consequences and has harmed himself by violating the law, slandering the government, and ruining others. He is extremely absurd. Therefore, he must first be rebuked and then investigated to serve as a warning. This is a reply to Huang Mingxia. It is said that the letter was sent by registered mail to the original address of Tu's Primary School in Changzhou, but after the school opened the letter, it did not recognize such a person. Chen is still investigating and preparing to prosecute.</p>

Recently, he received a letter from the International Industrial and Commercial Management Research Institute in Geneva, requesting him to initiate the organization of the Chinese Industrial and Commercial Management Association. He specially invited leaders of Shanghai's industry and commerce and experts in industrial and commercial management to a meeting yesterday to discuss everything. The letter is recorded as follows: "Dear Sir, Scientific management is deeply and significantly related to the development of industry and commerce. In this industrial era, advocacy and implementation cannot be delayed. This Ministry's administrative guidelines have long been included and are being gradually implemented. Recently, we received a letter from the International Industrial and Commercial Management Research Institute in Geneva, stating that the Institute has been established for three years, and 345 government agencies and important industrial groups from 29 countries have joined. The purpose is about four points: (1) To improve the organization of industrial and commercial enterprise administration; (2) To increase the efficiency of industrial and commercial production; (3) To collect data for scientific management research; (4) To facilitate the exchange of opinions among industrialists and businessmen.

<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce</h3>

<p>The Shanghai Office sends letters to commercial officers for introductions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce sent letters to Qian, the British Commercial Commissioner, and Wei, the American Commercial Counselor, yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, In order to improve industrial production and workers' work, this Ministry has specially dispatched staff members to various regions in the country to conduct detailed investigations and seek gradual progress.

<h3>Trademark News After the Promulgation of the Trademark Law</h3>
<p>The Trademark Law promulgated by the National Government has recently been discussed and amended by the Legislative Yuan. For example, in the various clauses under Article 2, the addition of the Chinese Kuomintang flag and emblem and those identical to the portrait and name of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen are all prohibited from being used as trademarks. There are also many other additions and deletions. The original regulations had a total of forty-four articles, which have now been changed to forty articles. Once the Executive Yuan promulgates the implementing rules, the new Trademark Law can be implemented. In addition, the Trademark Bureau's handling of trademark registration was previously overwhelmed with requests for examination and registration due to merchants' applications. The bureau was busy examining old cases, and there were also many cases where the new trademark applications were the same as the old trademarks that had already been registered. Therefore, the review took time. Although the Chinese Trademark Law is based on the principle of first use and has little to do with the order of registration, the bureau knows that the applicants are eagerly awaiting, so it has stepped up its work. Recently, many new trademarks have been approved, which is convenient for merchants. In order to facilitate merchants, the bureau's Shanghai office has now moved to the fifth floor of the Salt Bank on Beijing Road, which is centrally located and has convenient transportation.</p>
<h3>Solicitation of Issues for Unemployment Relief</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation received a letter from the Shanghai Commercial and Industrial Adjustment Council yesterday, stating: "We have received an instruction from the Municipal Government, which states: 'We have received an order from the Executive Yuan, which states: 'We have received an order from the National Government stating that the 74th National Affairs Conference proposed by Chairman Jiang states that the current social situation is due to years of domestic warfare, rampant bandits in the interior, people cannot live in peace, and industries cannot develop. Recently, due to the increase in world gold prices, the cost of living has increased accordingly, and most of the inland areas have suffered disasters. Food prices in various places have continued to rise, and unemployed people across the country have nowhere to go. People have lost the foundation of the country, which has become the biggest problem today. We should urgently gather group wisdom and study fundamental remedies. The issue of tariff autonomy has recently been resolved, and maintaining domestic industries can be gradually implemented. However, without concrete measures, we cannot start planning. We plan to convene a national unemployment problem research conference to provide relief.' This case has been resolved and ordered to be handled in accordance with this principle, and the Executive Yuan is ordered to solicit opinions from various ministries and industrial and commercial parties in Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to quickly seek relief. The municipal government is ordered to immediately follow this order to collect the opinions of the city's industrial and commercial circles and report them to the review office, etc. We hereby order the association to immediately follow this order, collect and reply in detail, so as to rely on the transfer, which is deeply anticipated." Matters related to unemployment relief are hereby conveyed to you, and we hope that you will check and promptly reply to the above opinions to the association for transfer.</p>

<h3>County Reorganization Council</h3>
<p>Requests to Stop Foreign Ships from Docking on Anhui Shores</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Party Affairs Reorganization Committee submitted a document to the Provincial Reorganization Committee yesterday, stating: "Submitting for a request. We have learned from reports that Anqing, Wuhu, and other places have allowed foreign ships to dock. We believe that foreign ships rely on the protection of unequal treaties to travel within the country, infringing on commerce and humiliating national sovereignty. Over the years, the losses have been incalculable. Recently, they have become even more ambitious and are advancing steadily, thinking of gradually occupying and seizing all of our Yangtze River port shipping. The above facts are clear evidence. Whether our country's shipping industry is declining and needs to be maintained, or this time's abandonment of treaties, progressive encroachment, and loss of national sovereignty, cannot be tolerated. The committee, seeing this, should submit a request to your committee, earnestly requesting that it be forwarded to the central government, and that the Anhui Provincial Government be swiftly ordered to stop it in order to maintain navigation rights, which is in the public interest."</p>
<h3>Important News from the Chinese Ratepayers Association</h3>
<p>Declaration Not a Misunderstanding</p>
<p>Telegram to Chinese Directors on Assuming Office</p>
<p>Letter from the Municipal Government Shanghai Special Municipal Government Letter No. 1447 to the Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association, stating: "Dear Sirs, We have received a letter from Mr. Cunningham, the American Consul General and Senior Consul in Shanghai, stating: 'We have received a letter from the Chinese Ratepayers Association on April 18, stating: "This Association officially issued the following declaration on April 17, 19th year of the Republic of China: 'This Association confirms that the Shanghai Public Concession Foreign Ratepayers Association has no right to discuss or decide on the civil rights that Chinese ratepayers in the Public Concession should have. Based on this principle, the rejection of the proposal to add two Chinese directors to the Municipal Council by the Foreign Ratepayers Association on April 16 of this year is naturally invalid. We hereby solemnly declare, and we request that you check it for our reference.' We have translated and forwarded it to the Municipal Council for verification. We have now received a reply from the Secretary of the Municipal Council stating that the Chinese Ratepayers Association believes that foreign ratepayers intend to decide on the rights of Chinese ratepayers in the Public Concession, which is a misunderstanding. The Municipal Council is well aware that foreign ratepayers have no right to decide on the issue of Chinese directors on the Municipal Council, and this power is in the hands of officials from various countries and China. The proposal submitted to the annual meeting of ratepayers on April 16 clearly indicated that the Municipal Council was aware of the limits of the rights of foreign ratepayers, and the proposal was entirely intended to obtain the opinions of foreign ratepayers on whether to request officials from various countries and China to find ways to increase the number of Chinese directors on the Municipal Council." We hereby request that Your Worship transmit the above explanation to the Chinese Ratepayers Association, and we hope that any misunderstandings among the Chinese community and the general public on this matter can be eliminated. Furthermore, the proposal passed by the special meeting of foreign ratepayers on May 2, recommending an increase in the number of Chinese directors from three to five, has been sincerely supported by our colleagues and has been communicated by letter. Now that it has been confirmed by the Diplomatic Corps, the Senior Consul is confident that the Chinese side will recognize this method as sufficient to demonstrate the Concession Authority's approval of the desire of Chinese ratepayers to seek further participation in municipal administration.' We hereby request that you check it for our reference."</p>
<p>The Ratepayers Association replied to the letter, stating: "Respected Sir, We have received the letter No. 1447 on May 15, (omitted)... We have learned that the declaration issued by this Association on April 17 of this year is based on legal principles and confirms that Chinese ratepayers and foreign ratepayers have the same qualifications as ratepayers. Therefore, neither has the right to discuss or decide on each other's rights. The authority to decide on the issue of Chinese directors on the Municipal Council, as the Secretary of the Municipal Council stated, is in the hands of officials from various countries and China. The addition of Chinese directors to the Municipal Council does not require the authorization of foreign ratepayers to the Municipal Council to request Chinese and foreign officials to negotiate and decide based on fair principles. It is not necessary to seek the opinions of foreign ratepayers. Therefore, this Association still believes that the previous declaration was not based on a misunderstanding. As for the increase in the number of Chinese directors, it has been sincerely supported and confirmed by the consuls and ministers of the countries concerned, and the Chinese ratepayers express their gratitude. However, since the Concession Authority has shown its approval of the desire of Chinese ratepayers to seek further participation in municipal administration through this method, it is hoped that the number of Chinese directors will be proportionate to the amount of taxes paid in the shortest possible time, which would better demonstrate the Concession Authority's approval. We hereby reply to the previous letter and request your review and consultation with the Senior Consul."</p>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs The Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association telegraphed Foreign Minister Wang yesterday, stating: "Respectfully to Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, It has been verified that the number of Chinese directors on the Municipal Council of the Public Concession has been agreed upon by our country and officials from various countries this year, increasing from the original three to five. It should be forwarded immediately, but the Foreign Ratepayers Association exceeded its authority to discuss and reject it, causing obstacles. After negotiation, the obstacles have been removed, and the five Chinese directors assumed their duties on May 14. We hereby telegram to request your attention and express our sincere gratitude. President of the Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jiying, respectfully."</p>
<h3>County Organizations</h3>
<p>Registration Must Be Approved by Party Headquarters</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received an instruction from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, stating that in order to comply with the order, an investigation into the procedures for establishing people's organizations, previously promulgated by the central government and circulated for notification, has revealed that many industrial and commercial organizations in various counties have submitted applications for establishment or reorganization. Fearing that some may not have followed the aforementioned procedures, and that some may be inconsistent with the spirit of party governance, the organizational plan for people's organizations and other documents have been compiled and distributed. Hereafter, the establishment or reorganization of chambers of commerce, trade unions, industry associations, etc., shall uniformly follow these procedures. Those who have already submitted applications for registration but have not followed the procedures should also supplement the necessary formalities, and this department's Instruction No. 229 has ordered compliance in the record. Currently, various industrial and commercial organizations are submitting applications for establishment or reorganization through the county magistrates, and it is often unclear whether the association has applied for permission from the party headquarters in accordance with the procedures, making it difficult to review. Therefore, it is ordered that the county magistrates, when dealing with applications for registration from various organizations in the future, should pay attention to verifying whether they have applied for permission from the local senior party headquarters in accordance with the legal procedures, and then forward them for review, and clearly state the preliminary investigation situation. This order.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Justice</h3>
<p>To Establish a New Prison in Shanghai</p>
<p>Xin Shanghai Sheyun reported that the Ministry of Justice of the National Government, due to the dilapidated state of China's existing prisons, the foul air, and the extremely unsanitary conditions, as well as the simple and crude nature of all other equipment, prisoners invariably fall ill upon entering prison, and the mental suffering is a hundred times greater than their deserved punishment. In order to remedy this shortcoming, the Ministry of Justice has repeatedly telegraphed local authorities to actively rectify prison facilities in order to emphasize humanitarianism. However, with the old model in place, reform is difficult. Although the exterior may be renovated, the interior remains as corrupt as ever. It is necessary to build new prisons, but due to economic constraints, widespread construction must wait.

Once there is a clue to the discussion, it will send personnel to Shanghai to survey the site and begin construction.</p>

<h3>More Silver Ingots to be Imported</h3>
<p>Longtian Maru Loaded a Large Batch from the United States to Shanghai</p>
<p>The order prohibiting the import of foreign silver has been officially announced. For days, foreign ships importing goods have been unable to load silver ingots and other items into Songkou. However, according to shipping circles yesterday, the Longkou Maru postal ship, which arrived from the United States on the 7th, is still carrying a large batch of silver ingots to China, intending to import them in Shanghai, valued at 837,991 yuan. The value to be imported to Hong Kong is 300,1245 yuan. However, due to the prohibition, the Jianghai Customs will definitely not allow it to be imported and may be transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Competitive Purchase of High-Quality Cocoons</h3>
<p>Chairman of the Silk Factory Trade Association Discussed and Decided</p>
<p>Shen Huachen, the chairman of the Shanghai Special Municipality Silk Factory Trade Association, in view of the recent drastic decline in the foreign silk market and the extremely low silk prices, which are rare during the new and old silkworm silk metabolism period in the past ten years, and given that the quality of new cocoons on the market in Zhejiang Province is related to the raw materials for silk production, specially accompanied Standing Committee Member Zhu Jing'an in mid-month, taking a gasoline boat, and went to cocoon-producing areas such as Linping Pingyao Haining Chang'an Jiaxing Huzhou Nanxun Wuxing Changxing in Hangzhou to inspect them in turn. Now that the inspection has been completed, he returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. According to the investigation results, the cocoon production in Zhejiang this year is most abundant near Hang County, followed by Wuxing Changxing Haining Chang'an, accounting for seventy to eighty percent of the normal year. However, the harvest in Shaoxing Xinshan and other places is the worst, only forty to fifty percent. The total cocoon production in Zhejiang is estimated to be seventy percent of last year's. The quality of the cocoons is still good. At a time when Chinese and Japanese raw silk are actively competing, the demand for domestic silk has increased sharply, and the silkworm harvest in Jiangsu Province has been affected by bandits and the weather, and is generally poor. It is deeply feared that this will lead to a raw material panic in the future. Chairman Shen has discussed with cocoon merchants in various places that if they encounter high-quality cocoons, they will bid competitively to increase silk production.</p>
<h3>Cocoon Tax Inspectors Arrive to Take Office</h3>
<p>Zeng Zefu, the Zhejiang cocoon tax inspection commissioner appointed by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance and stationed at the Shanghai South Railway Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, has now established a bureau and started working.

After receiving orders, the above inspectors have already started working yesterday.</p>
<h3>Anti-Drug Association Prepares for the June 3rd Commemoration</h3>
<p>June 3rd is the 91st anniversary of the ban on opium by Lin Zexu, the pioneering anti-drug figure in our country. Last year, the National Government issued an order to all provinces, cities, and counties to hold commemorative events on this day every year to show praise. The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association believes that the commemorative period is not far away, and that the commemoration by the people must be prepared as soon as possible. It has formulated commemorative measures and notified national anti-drug organizations to contact local party and government organs and public legal organizations to prepare for the event on schedule and increase the production of a large number of applied publicity materials to meet the needs of commemorations in various places. The association also believes that Shanghai is a focus of attention at home and abroad, and that a large-scale event is needed to show China's determination to combat drugs. The International Anti-Smoking Conference will be held this year in December. This commemoration will not only show China's determination to combat drugs, but also promote international attention. The association has specially contacted the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government of this special municipality to jointly prepare for a large-scale commemoration and has sent personnel to the above two places to negotiate. The preparatory meeting should be held soon.</p>
<h3>News from the Association of Families of May 30th Martyrs</h3>
<p>On May 30, 1925, He Bingyi, a student of Shanghai University, whose courtesy name was Nianci, was from Peng County, Sichuan Province. He was 23 years old at the time. He was shot in the back during a speech, penetrating his lungs and liver. He died the next day (May 31) at 2:22 p.m. after ineffective treatment. His father, He Yuancong, lived on Liansheng Street outside Peng County, Sichuan Province. Now, having learned that the Association of Families of May 30th Martyrs is convening a registration, he sent a letter from Shu and attached many certificates to apply for registration. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Respectfully, I am deeply grateful for the letter from your association, which I received through the post. After reading it, I respectfully acknowledge the precision of your association's work to prevent fraud. I am extremely impressed. The previous two letters, as well as the certificates delivered by Wu Bingxun and directly to your association, I hope have also been received. Now, I have discovered the embezzlement of condolence money, so your association must be extra cautious. Therefore, I have sent another copy of the approval for the death of my son Bingyi, as well as letters from the memorial service, the Student Federation, the funeral committee, and the diplomatic support committee, as proof for the distribution of condolence money. If this payment is approved, it should still be delivered to Wu Bingxun at the Xieji Xing store in Fushen Lane, Zhengjia Muqiao, so that both the living and the dead will be grateful. However, there is more that I hope for from your association in the future. Although I have received a share of the condolence money, my widowed daughter-in-law and orphaned grandson are not yet grown up, and my aging parents still need support. As for compensation for the loss of life, I earnestly request your association to continue to handle it. As for Bingyi's coffin, it was previously requested by the Student Federation to be returned to Sichuan for a public burial. Now, the Student Federation has been suspended, and the coffin is still exposed to the sun in front of the provincial gate, with no hope of burial. I earnestly request your association to provide assistance and advice, so that it can be buried as soon as possible. The martyr will be grateful. Sincerely, He Yuancong's seal, April 29, Association of Families of May 30th Martyrs. (There are several individual errors in the original letter, which our association has recorded without change to preserve its authenticity.)" After receiving the letter, the association replied to the family of the martyr He: "In reply, we have received your family's letter of April 29, as well as the instructions from the Sichuan-Kangbian Affairs Superintendent, and one copy each of the letters from the memorial service, the Student Federation, the funeral committee, and the diplomatic support committee. There are no errors. As for the compensation part, we will submit it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government and wait for a resolution. The letter states that the martyr He's coffin is exposed to the sun in front of the provincial gate and there is no hope of burial. According to our investigation, May 30th martyrs should be buried in the Shanghai May 30th Cemetery for admiration and immortality. However, since the martyr He's coffin has already been returned to his hometown, it would be extremely inconvenient and costly to return it to Shanghai for burial in the public cemetery. In our humble opinion, it would be simpler and easier to bury it in your province. (A memorial stele for martyr He has been erected in the Shanghai May 30th Cemetery.) We do not know your opinion. Please decide and let us know so that we can provide assistance or achieve results. Furthermore, our association is planning to publish a memorial publication to preserve it for a long time and is currently collecting portraits of the families of the martyrs for printing. Therefore, please send a recent portrait (4 inches in size) to the association as soon as possible. This reply to Mr. He Yuancong, the family of the martyr."</p>
<p>The May 30th martyrs were Chen Qin, Yin Jingyi, He Bingyi, Yang Lianfa, Wang Jifu, Chen Zhaochang, Hua Zongyun, Tang Liangsheng, Fu Wenxin, Wang Kuibao, Xu Guisheng, Shi Songsheng, Wu Jinhua, Yao Shunqing, Luo Wenzhao, Zhan Shenbing, Zhu Heshang, Tan Haigen, Tan Quanfu, Wei Guoping, Chen Xingfa, Wang Dongming, Cai Fuquan, Jin Nianshiqi, and Xu Luofeng, a total of 25 people. Their coffins were initially placed in various township association halls. Later, the directors of the May 30th Cemetery, Cheng Xiechun, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Binyan, Chen Dewei, Wu Kaixian, Long Tiyao, Yuan Ludeng, Wang Yansong, and others, specially raised funds to purchase more than ten mu of land at Fangjia Muqiao at the end of Baoxing Road in Zhabei to build the May 30th Cemetery, which was buried on May 25, 17th year of the Republic of China. However, a few families of the martyrs were misled by old customs and did not bury them in the public cemetery, but returned them to their ancestral tombs in their hometowns. Some families were unable to afford burial and still placed the coffins of the martyrs in the association halls. As the fifth anniversary is approaching, the families of the martyrs Wang Kuibao and Chen Zhaochang have decided to relocate their burials to the public cemetery. Yesterday, Wei Guoxiang, the family member of the martyr Wei Guoping, went to the Association of Families of May 30th Martyrs and requested that the martyr Wei be relocated to the public cemetery. The association representatives, Hu Changsheng and Chen Fucai, agreed with Mr. Cheng Xiechun, the director of the May 30th Cemetery, that the relocation would be carried out on May 28, along with the coffins of the martyrs Wang and Chen, so that they could be honored by all sectors on the fifth anniversary. Martyr Wei Guoping was a worker at Hengfeng Yarn Factory. On June 3, 1925, he was fatally shot by a Western police officer on Lan Road in Yangshupu. He was 23 years old at the time and was from Siyang, Jiangsu. He had only one brother, Wei Guoxiang, and his family was extremely poor.</p>
<h3>Pharmaceutical Workers</h3>
<p>Petitioned at Party and Government Agencies Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Pharmaceutical Workers' Union held a general meeting of all members in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. Although it was raining continuously, the number of members attending was still very enthusiastic, with several hundred people. After the meeting, all the members went to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government to petition, demanding the immediate closure of the Pharmaceutical Trade Association and the intensification of the arrest of the main elements of the trade association who instigated resistance to the central government, in order to quell labor-management disputes.</p>
<h3>Japanese Assassinate a Chinese Worker in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The Deceased's Name is Feng Shoushan</p>
<p>Seamen's Union Strives for Justice</p>
<p>The Chinese Seamen's Union received a telegram from the Guangdong branch yesterday stating that Feng Shoushan was tragically assassinated by a Japanese national for money. The case has been referred to the central government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for negotiation. The original text is as follows: "According to a telegram from the Guangdong branch of our association, Feng Shoushan, a member of the association, was on the Dantada Hao of the Ironworks Company, returning from Australia, when he was assassinated by a Japanese national for money. The murderer is being tried in Hong Kong. As our seamen have no Hong Kong association and no Chinese consulate, their safety is not guaranteed. For the benefit of all, the association requests that you telegraph the National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and immediately telegram the Governor of Hong Kong to punish the murderer according to the law and order the company to provide compensation for work-related injury and death. A detailed report will follow." Based on this, the Japanese have brutally killed Chinese people repeatedly, and their cruelty is outrageous. The law should be strictly enforced, and we should report the situation to the Ministry and immediately telegram the Governor of Hong Kong to punish the murderer and provide compensation for the deceased, in order to comfort the wronged soul and maintain national dignity. (Association Seal) Kou, Ge Yin.</p>
<h3>Military Academy</h3>
<p>Students Violate Shipboard Regulations</p>
<p>Shipping Association Telegrams to Demand Crackdown</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association presented a document from the Commander-in-Chief yesterday, stating (summary omitted): "According to a letter from the Business Director Association of the China Merchants Bureau, last summer, during the summer vacation, the Jianghai merchant ships were disturbed by military academy students traveling back and forth, who did not abide by the regulations and were unreasonable, leading legitimate passengers to fear their power and switch to foreign ships, causing damage to the bureau's reputation and business. Now that the summer vacation is approaching, military academy students will have to return to their hometowns, and the above-mentioned situation will inevitably occur. The business directors of our association are deeply concerned and worried. If we do not think ahead and prevent problems, the impact on the future of our business will be significant. We should request the Association to present the situation to the Commander-in-Chief's Office and severely crack down on it, in order to protect merchants and travelers and maintain the shipping industry. This will not only be appreciated by the business colleagues of the China Merchants Bureau." It is reasonable to present the situation and request your approval and order to severely crack down on it, so as to protect business and avoid losses, which is a public virtue for both parties.</p>
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>Lawyers Appearing in County Courts</p>
<p>The Judicial Administration Yuan of the National Government has now begun to rectify the judiciary nationwide, and county courts will be established in various counties in order. Currently, places where county courts have been established successively include Nantong and Wujin counties. However, regarding the issue of lawyers appearing in court, the members of the Shanghai Lawyers Association sent a letter to inquire. The Jiangsu Higher Court had previously ordered the association that the appearance of lawyers in county courts was limited to the county courts attached to the local courts. The association, considering that there were still doubts about the document forwarded to the Ministry, submitted it to the Standing Committee to send letters to various lawyers associations to solicit opinions. The case will be presented for discussion again at the 53rd joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committee members.</p>

<h3>In Front of the Great World</h3>
<p>Captured Kidnappers from Nanhui</p>
<p>Yu Genlin's Extravagant Wedding</p>
<p>Bandits Coveted and Kidnapped</p>
<p>Demanded 10,000, No Result</p>
<p>Second Contact Yielded Two Bandits</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, around 5 p.m., two kidnappers from the kidnapping case in Sanzao Township, Nanhui County, were arrested in front of the Great World amusement park on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Kidnapped After Robbery: Yu Genlin, 21 years old, from Sanzao Township, Nanhui County, Pudong. His family traditionally farmed. His father passed away early, leaving him over 30 acres of ancestral farmland and some savings. Yu married not long ago, and the wedding was somewhat extravagant, attracting the attention of bandits. On May 5th of this year, he was first robbed and then kidnapped, disappearing without a trace.</p>
<p>Letter Left Behind: Since his marriage, Yu had repeatedly received letters from bandits trying to extort large sums of money, but he ignored them. However, on the night of May 5th of this year, around 10 p.m., more than a dozen bandits suddenly arrived, each armed with pistols and sharp weapons. They first ransacked the house and then kidnapped Yu and fled. Before leaving, they left a letter, arranging for Yu's family to meet them at the Shenzhou Hotel on Zhejiang Road in Shanghai on the 12th.</p>
<p>Hotel Negotiation: After Yu was kidnapped, his family was extremely anxious. After discussion, they sent Yu's uncle, Fu Yinkui, to Shanghai on time to meet with the bandits at the Shenzhou Hotel. The bandits demanded 10,000 yuan. Fu argued that Yu was on the verge of bankruptcy and could not afford such a large sum. The negotiation ended without success, and they dispersed. Upon returning to Nanhui, Fu reported the situation to the Nanhui County Public Security Bureau, requesting an investigation and arrest.</p>
<p>Secret Letter: The bureau chief, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered the investigation team leader to solve the case within a specified time. On the morning of the 18th, when Yu's family opened the door, they noticed a letter stuck to the door, with the words "For Brother Yu, read this in secret" written on it. They tore it down and opened it, finding it was another letter from the bandits, arranging for Yu's family to send the same person who made the initial contact to the entrance of the Great World amusement park in Shanghai at 5:30 to 6 p.m. on the 20th. If they still delayed, they would tear up the ticket (kill Yu).</p>
<p>Five Cigarettes: This time, the bandits' letter instructed Yu's family to send the same person who made the initial contact (referring to Fu Yinkui), wearing the same clothes as before. They were to stand facing south next to the first telephone pole south of the entrance to the Great World amusement park on Avenue Edward VII in Shanghai, holding five cigarettes in their left hand as a signal. Someone would approach them at the designated time.</p>
<p>Disguised Ambush: After receiving the letter, Yu's family secretly reported to the Nanhui County Public Security Bureau and followed the bandits' instructions. The investigation team leader, Tang Yunzhong, along with detective Qu Tingling, came to Shanghai together the day before yesterday (the 19th). They first reported to the French Concession police station. Upon hearing the news, the police chief ordered four detectives to join the officers from Nanhui, disguising themselves and waiting in ambush in front of the Great World.</p>
<p>Secret Signal: At 5:15 p.m., the detectives were pre-positioned around the entrance of the Great World. Yu's uncle, Fu Yinkui, stood holding five cigarettes under the first telephone pole to the south, waiting until 6:05 p.m. Sure enough, two young men dressed in serge robes and looking respectable walked up to Fu and began to speak to him. Fu recognized that one of the men was the one he had met at the Shenzhou Hotel. He gave a secret signal, and the detectives all rushed forward.</p>
<p>Two Bandits Captured: There were two bandits in total. After one bandit was captured, the other attempted to escape, but he was caught after a few steps. They were immediately taken to the police station. After questioning by the police chief, one identified himself as Ye Gensheng, 43 years old, and the other as Zhang Asan, 25 years old, both from Pudong. The rest of their testimony was evasive. However, Yu's uncle confirmed that Ye was the one he had met at the Shenzhou Hotel. After the interrogation, the police chief ordered them to be detained separately and sent to the court for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Managed by the Public Works Department</h3>
<p>The Library Will Move</p>
<p>Western Newspaper Records Its Past History</p>
<p>And Hopes For Its Future Development</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the library managed by the Public Works Department of the International Settlement will be moved to the former American Club building in the alley next to the Lin Wenyan Tobacco Company at 104 Nanjing Road. Yesterday (the 19th), they began packing and loading. The library is scheduled to reopen for lending on June 2nd. The library was founded in 1849. By 1854, it had 1,276 books and 30 types of magazines and newspapers. Initially, it was attached to the Chess Club. The Public Works Department took over management at that time. The membership fee was originally set at 25 taels per year, but it was reduced to 15 taels from that year.</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that the library managed by the Public Works Department will move from the small, dark room next to the City Hall to a new, spacious, and well-ventilated building. However, it is unknown whether it will eventually have all the books needed for a typical library, such as reference books, encyclopedias, maps, and other books, to become a real library. The new building will have a very large room for storing books, as well as a public reading room, a member reading room, and an office for staff. According to last year's statistics, a total of 14,226 people visited the library, an average of only 38 people per day. There are probably several reasons why it does not attract the attention of citizens, one of which is the lack of a children's reading room and facilities for children to read. Recently, someone went to borrow an encyclopedia, but there was only an old edition from 42 years ago. In addition, good books about China, political yearbooks, and various reference books are lacking. The library of the Asiatic Society has books about Chinese art, literature, and history, but the city-run library only has old books and books that can only be borrowed by members. Since it is called a public library, it should at least have a Chinese yearbook and the latest Chinese history books. The public's greatest needs are novels and travel books, so of the 51,784 books borrowed last year, 46,777 were novels. More than half of the 21,000 books currently in the library are novels. The rest are legends, science, and works discussing general issues. But if more history, poetry, drama, and yearbook reference books could be purchased, we know that it would attract more attention from citizens. Last year, the library's expenses totaled 7,170 taels, with 2,820 taels for the librarian's salary, 1,370 taels for the Chinese assistant's salary, and 1,350 taels for the clerk's salary, totaling 5,540 taels. In addition, 1,530 taels were used for maintenance expenses, and 1,100 taels for magazines and newspapers, leaving only 1,500 taels to purchase books. Fortunately, the city hall provides the building, so no rent is required, and 383 new books can be added. It is unknown how the rent will be paid in the future, and how the books will be purchased.</p>
<h3>Over a Hundred Vendors</h3>
<p>Going to France, Unable to Enter</p>
<p>Someone Handles Passports</p>
<p>The Ignorant Villagers are Deceived, Pitiful</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Strictly Investigates</p>
<p>According to a telegram from the embassy in France, more than a hundred vendors and merchants who recently came to France from Shanghai were refused entry by the French authorities. They requested that the passport-issuing authorities be asked to verify whether the passports held by the vendors and merchants had real guarantors and requested an immediate reply by telegram. After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs forwarded the letter to the various passport-issuing authorities, it was learned yesterday that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had approved a telegram from the embassy in France stating that there were two to three hundred vendors and merchants who had come to France in succession, all of whom had taken ships from Shanghai. However, the passports held by the vendors and merchants were mostly issued by the Guangzhou municipal authorities and then taken to Shanghai to board ships. It was also learned that the vendors and merchants were mostly from the Wen and Chu areas of Zhejiang, intending to go to France and then to other countries to do business. As for why they obtained passports from Guangzhou, it was said that someone named Chen had handled them on their behalf and that all contacts had been made in Shanghai. Chen's daring to handle passports and deceive ignorant villagers into going abroad to do business is extremely illegal and should be strictly investigated to prevent further deception. It is said that after receiving the telegram, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent letters to the Guangzhou municipal government and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government to conduct a secret investigation and punish them according to the law to the fullest extent.</p>
<h3>Alas, the Wife of My Youth</h3>
<p>In Tears, Throws Herself into the Huangpu River</p>
<p>A Poor Man Suddenly Becomes Comfortable</p>
<p>Marries a Beautiful Concubine</p>
<p>Actually Abuses His Old Wife</p>
<p>Utterly Lacking Conscience</p>
<p>Wang Yuguan, from Anhui, runs an ice cream shop at 106 Avenue Petain in the French Concession. His wife, Wang Songshi, is 41 years old this year. The couple has been married for nearly 20 years. They used to be poor and humble, but through hard work and thrift, they became well-off. However, as people often say, after being full and warm, one will think of lust, and an old wife who has tasted hardship is not enough to please him. Therefore, in October of last year, he took a young woman in her prime as a concubine. He listened to her every word and treated his wife as if she were worn-out shoes, and often abused her. Wang Songshi had a narrow mind and could not bear the grievance. Filled with resentment, she thought it was better to die than live. On the 19th of this month, she left home alone, intending to go to Wusong to visit relatives, but she did not meet them. Seeing the vast sea, she had the idea of committing suicide. She walked to the riverbank, and with tears in her eyes, threw herself into the water. She was rescued by a police officer and taken to the 7th District police station. After learning the whole story, Wang Yuguan was summoned to the station and, together with his wife, was transferred to the local court for interrogation yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Widow</h3>
<p>Asks the Main Wife for Her Biological Son</p>
<p>Young Widow Works as a Servant to Make a Living</p>
<p>Mother and Son Separated, the Situation is Tragic</p>
<p>Lawsuit Filed in Court, Reconciliation Reached</p>
<p>They Return Home to Raise the Child Together</p>
<p>Lin Lingshi, a woman from Yangzhou, also known as Ling Renzhen, is 27 years old. When she was eight years old, she was sold by her father, Ling Shunzhang, to the Pan family as a servant. The Pan family lived in Shenjiawan, where she suffered all kinds of hardships. At the age of sixteen, the Pan family sold her to Lin Huiqing as a concubine. Lin was from Dinghai Zhoushan and was engaged in foreign trade, with considerable assets. He currently lives at No. 5, Chongan Lane, Xiaozha Bridge Street, outside Xiaonanmen, Shanghai. After Renzhen married into the family, she gave birth to a son named Guoxian the following year, who is now nine years old. The wife and concubine lived together harmoniously. Lin's first wife, Lin Yingshi, had only given birth to a daughter. Unexpectedly, Lin Huiqing died of illness in 1925, leaving Renzhen without protection. There were frequent quarrels between the wife and concubine. Renzhen could no longer bear it, so she left on the third day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar last year and went to work as a servant in the Yang family's house at No. 603, Fuxu Lane, Park Road.</p>
<p>Working as a Servant to Make a Living: Looking at Ling Renzhen's life, she was sold by her father to the Pan family as a servant since she was a child. When she was 28 years old, she was sold by the Pan family to Lin Huiqing, an old man in his sixties, as a concubine, hoping to spend her happy days. However, Renzhen's fate was unfortunate. She lost her husband in less than six years.</p>
<p>A Beautiful Woman with a Hard Fate: Ling Renzhen wants to take back her biological son, Guoxian, who is still with the main wife, Lin Yingshi, for upbringing. Therefore, she recently hired lawyer Zhu Kuangming to file a lawsuit with the local court.</p>
<p>Lawsuit Filed for the Return of the Child: Her statement roughly stated that the plaintiff married Lin Huiqing, the husband of the defendant Lin Yingshi, as a concubine in 1919. In 1922, she gave birth to a son, Guoxian, who is now nine years old. In 1925, Huiqing died of illness. The plaintiff felt that her life was miserable and could only raise her son and live as a widow. However, the defendant Lin Yingshi was fierce and domineering, and used her authority as the main wife to abuse the plaintiff in every possible way.</p>
<p>Beating and Insulting Without End: What is even more hateful is that she alienated the relationship between the biological mother and son and refused to allow the mother to educate and manage the child. This is not only a violation of the law but also a great betrayal of humanity. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit requesting that Guoxian be</p>
<p>Returned to the Plaintiff for Upbringing: So that they can be reunited. Yesterday morning, Judge Guo Shouyi specially opened the Fourth Tribunal to hear the case. The defendant, Lin Yingshi, also hired lawyer Wang Jianfan to present her defense. According to the plaintiff, Lin Lingzhen, she is 27 years old and currently works as a servant in the Yang family's house on Park Road, earning four yuan a month. She also recounted her past experiences. She also said that she had a quarrel with the defendant and left on the third day of the tenth month of last year. When the judge asked why they had a quarrel, she replied, "I wanted to buy shoes and asked her for money, but she refused to give it to me, so I left in a fit of anger to work as a servant. Since they have published a notice of separation, my biological son should be returned to me," and so on. The defendant, Lin Yingshi, testified that she is 58 years old, from Dinghai, and lives at No. 5, Chongan Lane, Xiaozha Bridge, outside Xiaonanmen. When asked if she had driven the plaintiff out, she replied, "She left on her own." The judge said, "Now I order her to return home, what do you say?" She replied, "She can come back, but she quarrels every three days and every five days, how can I bear it? Moreover, the child is</p>
<p>My husband's flesh and blood should be raised by me." The judge asked the plaintiff again, since the defendant allows you to return home and live together, the plaintiff replied, "I can go back, but the child must be given to me to raise, and the authority in the family must also be given to me." The judge said, "You and the defendant will raise the child together, but you are not allowed to take the child out and not return." At this point, the defendant interjected, "After she comes home, she often looks for quarrels, then</p>
<p>How can we live together?" The judge said, "This case is about returning the child. If you talk about quarreling, that is another matter." Therefore, the plaintiff's lawyer rose and said, "Please advise the defendant not to abuse the plaintiff in the future." The judge then said to the defendant, "You are old, and the plaintiff is young, you should be considerate of her. Moreover, she</p>
<p>She is a young widow and should be respected. There should be no more abuse in the future. If you abuse her, you will commit a criminal offense." He also instructed the plaintiff to respect the main wife and value harmony in the family. "You can take the child out to play, but you are not allowed to take him out and not return." Both parties expressed their willingness. The plaintiff returned home to live with the defendant, and the child was raised together. A reconciliation was reached, and both parties signed and left the court.</p>

<h3>Chinese Husband and American Wife</h3>
<p>Dispute Over Custody of Adopted Son</p>
<p>Four-Year-Old Child Arrives in Shanghai from the United States and is Immediately Detained: The Da Wan Bao reported that a Chinese overseas citizen surnamed Yin (transliteration) brought his four-year-old adopted son back from the United States. However, today (20th), after arriving in Shanghai on the President McKinley, he was immediately detained by US Marshal Bode based on a telegram from the US State Department. Yin immediately went to the marshal's office to argue. According to his statement to Prosecutor Sa Ziede, he runs a restaurant in the United States. His wife is an American woman. The child was adopted from an orphanage in New York four years ago, and the couple loved him very much. Three years ago, he planned to return to his hometown in Guangdong with his savings, but his American wife refused, resulting in marital problems that have not yet been resolved. He could not bear it, so he abandoned his wife in the United States and secretly took his adopted son back. When his wife heard the news, she immediately reported it to the police station, requesting the return of her adopted son. The police station forwarded the matter to the State Department, which sent a telegram to Shanghai. The case is currently under investigation by Prosecutor Sa. The adopted son is temporarily being raised by Marshal Bode. According to Sa, the Yin couple seems to love the child very much, and each wants to claim him. However, the question of who signed the adoption papers seems to need to be investigated first.</p>
<h3>American Missionary Ms. Wegener</h3>
<p>Confirmed to be Suffering from Mental Illness</p>
<p>Will Be Deported Back to the United States</p>
<p>American missionary Ms. Wegener was accused of suffering from mental illness, and the US Marshal's Office held a trial and, for the first time, summoned six female jurors to serve on the jury. The case was previously reported in the news. The case was reopened yesterday for further hearing. Dr. Nan testified first, stating that the defendant claimed to be an important person under Jesus, had personally heard Jesus's words, and had received letters from Jesus, and accused the witness of intending to abuse and harm her body. Afterwards, two other doctors and a female missionary from the China Inland Mission testified. According to a Russian doctor specializing in mental illness, the defendant was suffering from a type of mental illness that could not be cured. The female jurors then retired to discuss for a few minutes and returned, stating that the defendant was indeed suffering from mental illness. The judge then ordered the defendant to be temporarily sent to the mental ward of the Victoria Nursing Home for treatment, and to be deported back to the United States after the US government designated a place to receive her.</p>
<h3>Advertising on Rickshaws</h3>
<p>Must First be Submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities for Approval</p>
<p>Recently, the Universal Advertising Agency planned to display various advertisements on rickshaws operating in the International Settlement and wrote to the Public Works Department for its consent. The department granted its request and stipulated relevant restrictions to be observed. The matter has been reported in the news. It is now known that the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities believes that these rickshaws all have licenses issued by the city and enter and exit the city's areas. If they display advertisements, they should be submitted for approval before they can be implemented. Therefore, it has ordered the Chinese and Foreign Rickshaw Merchants Association and the Rickshaw Industry and Commerce Mutual Aid Federation to be notified that vehicles that violate the rules will be fined when entering the urban area to enforce the regulations.</p>
<h3>Finnish Chargé d'Affaires Requests</h3>
<p>Protection of Female Missionaries in Jiangxi Province to Leave the Country</p>
<p>The Finnish Chargé d'Affaires to China, Wei Meiji, recently received a telegram from missionaries of his country in Hunan Province, stating that the western part of the province is currently carrying out a large-scale suppression of bandits. In view of the abduction of three female missionaries of their country in Jiangxi Province, they have become frightened and requested that the Chinese government be asked to ask the military and police authorities in Hunan Province to find a way to protect them and leave the country to avoid danger. Chargé d'Affaires Wei once made a request to Chen Shiguang, director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Director Chen telegraphed the request of Chargé d'Affaires Wei to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for approval.</p>
<h3>HSBC Ten Yuan Note</h3>
<p>Actually Altered to a Hundred Yuan Note</p>
<p>Two Women Detained for Using Them</p>
<p>Each Sentenced to Two and a Half Years in Prison</p>
<p>Recently, HSBC's ten-yuan banknotes have been found to have been altered to one hundred yuan and discovered in the market. After learning of this, the bank reported it to the police station for investigation. Fortunately, there are not many of these banknotes, and the financial sector will not be affected. At the end of last month, the police station had already solved a case of using counterfeit banknotes. The users were two women who used the altered banknotes at No. 1882, No. 1888, and other foreign goods stores on East and West Huade Roads. The stores discovered the fraud, and the police were called to take them and the four counterfeit banknotes to the Huishan Police Station. Later, another banknote was found in the stocking of one of the two women, Wang Chenshi. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Special District Local Court for further interrogation. HSBC sent a Western employee to the court to prove the alteration of the banknotes. Judge Ge then interrogated the defendant Chen Gushi, who testified that the banknotes were given to her by Wang Chenshi to be used at various foreign goods stores. The woman also said that if she was discovered, she could attribute it to her husband's income from selling goods. Next, Wang Chenshi testified that the banknotes were brought from Guangdong by her husband's friend from Guangdong. After the interrogation, Judge Ge sentenced Chen Gushi and Wang Chenshi each to two years and six months in prison. The five altered banknotes were confiscated, and the foreign cloth and other items seized were returned to the original owners.</p>
<h3>Wu Yingyi, Who Used Counterfeit Mercantile Bank Notes, Sentenced</h3>

<h3>Younger Brother's Savings</h3>
<p>Elder Brother Appropriates and Faces Lawsuit</p>
<p>Principal and Interest Totaling 20,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Both Parties Reconcile After Following Advice</p>
<p>Qian Kangfu, a native of Ningbo, has just come of age, but he is born of a concubine. When his father died, Kangfu was still in his infancy. He inherited 20,000 taels of cash, which was deposited in the Yuanchang Company, in which he had shares. Later, Kangfu's elder brother, Zhongqing, who was the manager of the company, lent 15,000 taels of his savings to his sister Qian Lin Shoumei to use as a guarantee for becoming a compradore. Later, Lin repaid 5,000 taels, still owing 10,000 taels, which she has not been able to repay due to poverty. In addition, she has been unable to pay the monthly interest of 7 taels and 5 mace per thousand taels since the eighth month. Kangfu is now grown up and alleges that his elder brother lent his savings without his consent. He has hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Special District Local Court, requesting that Qian Zhongqing be ordered to repay the principal and interest of 20,000 taels. The court has held one hearing that was not concluded. Yesterday morning, the hearing continued. According to the defendant Qian Zhongqing's testimony, he had obtained the consent of his stepmother Qian Chenshi (Kangfu's biological mother) when lending the money and presented a note written by Lin. However, Qian Chenshi stated that she had returned to her hometown since the year the Eight-Nation Alliance attacked Tianjin and did not return to Shanghai until the year before last. She did not know in advance that her eldest son had lent his son-in-law the money that her husband had deposited in Yuanchang for Kangfu. Judge Zhou believed that the plaintiff and defendant were brothers and should not harm their brotherly relationship over a mere loan. He advised each to make concessions and resolve the matter peacefully. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that before the case was litigated, fellow villagers Yuan Ludeng and Dong Xingsheng had stepped in to mediate. Now, if they continue to seek a settlement, they would like to invite the two gentlemen, Yuan and Dong, to act as mediators again. Judge Zhou then ordered the case to be postponed to June 11 for further hearing. If a resolution can be reached within the period, a statement will be filed.</p>
<h3>Li Weihou</h3>
<p>Withdraws the Case Against Zhao Tieqiao</p>
<p>The dispute between Zhao and Li of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been completely resolved after mediation. It is said that various criminal and civil cases in which both parties have sued each other have also been withdrawn. For example, the case in which Li Weihou accused Zhao Tieqiao of dereliction of duty was originally scheduled to be heard yesterday afternoon by Feng Shide, the judge in charge of the Special District Local Court. However, because Li Weihou's lawyer filed a petition to withdraw the complaint, which was approved by Judge Feng, the hearing was not held yesterday afternoon. Likewise, there is no need for legal resolution in the case in which Zhao sued Li.</p>
<h3>Gold Ornaments Galore</h3>
<p>The Robbery Case Must Be Substantial</p>
<p>Two Robbers Captured in Two Places</p>
<p>Several Households Robbed, Still Under Investigation</p>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, Detectives Zhu Hanbo and Liu Decheng of the Harbin Police Station, in collaboration with Western detectives, went to No. 168 Yuanfang Road and No. 2663 East and West Huade Roads to arrest two robbers, Chen Yao from Jiangxi and Zhao Fushou from Zhenjiang. They found 30 gold rings, 26 gold bracelets, three gold needles, and 273 yuan in cash. Chen and Zhao are accomplices of Shen Yulong and others who were captured at the Jiaotong Hotel on Avenue Edward VII a few days ago. These gold ornaments were likely obtained through robbery. Judging from the quantity, the robbery case committed is substantial. Yesterday morning, the police station escorted them to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Ge Zhitan interrogated them and ordered them to be detained for further investigation with Shen and the other robbers. The number of households robbed is still under strict investigation.</p>
<h3>Handover Method for the Da Zhen Ship</h3>
<p>Ship Price First Deposited with the Court</p>
<p>Defendant Guarantees All Disputes</p>
<p>Hengping Company sold the Da Zhen ship to Antong Company. Because it could not be unloaded on time, Hengping's shareholders Tao Longxuan and others were sued by Antong in the Special District Local Court. After the hearing, it was ordered that the ship price be paid in full by both parties within three days. When the three-day period expired, problems arose again during the handover. Therefore, at 2 p.m. that day, the lawyers representing both parties went to the Special District Court together. Judge Sun opened the hearing and according to the plaintiff Antong's lawyer, today morning (19th) was the deadline for payment of the ship price. Tao Longxuan, the representative of the defendant company, did not hand over the various relevant documents, and the plaintiff was afraid that disputes would arise in the future, so they did not dare to pay the ship price rashly. They requested that the judge order the defendant to hand over all the documents to the plaintiff to clear the procedures. Subsequently, the defendant's lawyers E Sen and Shan Yuhua presented the ship's license issued by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications and made a statement in defense. Judge Sun ruled that Shao Ying, the representative of Antong, should deposit the payable ship price of more than 110,000 taels with the court. If no accident occurs after two weeks, the defendant can claim the money. The defendant was also ordered to provide a guarantee to guarantee all disputes over property rights for a period of six months. In addition, a statement will be published in Chinese and foreign newspapers. Both parties then left in accordance with the order.</p>

<h3>Acquittal of Jiang Jing Steamer Room Attendant Falsely Accused</h3>
<p>The Jiang Jing steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, while sailing upstream to Jiujiang on the 16th of last month, had a certain Tu, a purser from a lighter in that area, introduce a Mr. and Mrs. Zhang Ruilan as passengers who sought to travel to Wuxue without paying fare. The steamer's room attendant, Wei Jiugao, received them. Upon arrival at Wuxue, Wei Jiugao handed over all the passengers' luggage and belongings, making sure nothing was missing. Unexpectedly, when the steamer sailed downstream and arrived in Jiujiang, Mr. Zhang conspired with Tu to instruct the lighter's patrol police to arrest Wei Jiugao and take him to the Second Squad of the Water Police Bureau, falsely accusing him of stealing gold items worth about eighty yuan from a suitcase, intending to extort money. The Jiujiang branch of the Seamen's Union bailed him out, and simultaneously initiated serious negotiations. Subsequently, room attendant Wei Jiugao submitted a petition to the Shanghai branch of the Seamen's Union, requesting redress. The Shanghai branch then dispatched personnel to investigate and confirmed that he had indeed been falsely accused. They immediately reported to the General Union and sent a letter back to the Jiujiang branch, arguing with reason and demanding severe punishment for Zhang Ruilan's false accusation and insult to a good seaman. The left squad leader there, Lian De, learned the truth, interrogated and confirmed the facts, and detained Zhang Ruilan for five days as a warning. Wei Jiugao was declared innocent. He has now arrived in Shanghai and is reporting on everything that happened, considering it resolved.</p>
<h3>Order to Arrest the Bandits Who Kidnapped Wang Xiaoda</h3>
<p>Wang Bin'yan's third son, Xiaoda, the head of the Zhabei Defense Corps, was kidnapped by bandits, but was rescued by detectives. Two bandits, Chen A'san and Zhu Xiaomazi, were arrested, and they confessed without hesitation. Two other masterminds, Shen Yinbiao and Guan Shengshun, are still at large. Yesterday, the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Director Yuan, received instructions from the Municipal Government and immediately ordered all district and team personnel to intensify the search and arrest them for interrogation.</p>
<h3>A Brawl Over One Yuan</h3>
<p>Clearly Not Good People</p>
<p>Sentenced and Imprisoned Separately</p>
<p>Yang Changyu from Jiangbei was attacked by Du Yuxiang and Hu Guocai with weapons in the French Concession the night before, causing severe head injuries. Patrol officers arrived and arrested Du and Hu, taking them to the police station. Yesterday, they were brought before the French court for questioning. The plaintiff complained about the assault, stating that the people had sought to recover a debt from Du that day, leading to the beating, and requested investigation. Du Yuxiang confessed that the people had borrowed one yuan from the plaintiff's mother, instructing them not to return it to the plaintiff. That day, the plaintiff forcibly demanded the money from the people, leading to a dispute, but he denied committing violence. Hu Guocai confessed that the people were advising from the sidelines, but his other statements were evasive. The court sentenced Du to ten days of imprisonment as a warning, and Hu to seven days as a warning.</p>
<h3>Mother and Son, the Chen Family, Accuse Each Other's Shortcomings</h3>
<p>Around 9 PM the night before, Chen Wu, a local woman residing at No. 126 Nancang Street outside Xiaonanmen, dragged her son, Chen Zhi Qiao, to the Third Sub-station of the First District to complain that her son was disobedient and unruly, requesting punishment. During the preliminary hearing conducted by Chief Jin, Ms. Chen stated that she was 43 years old and that her son did not engage in legitimate employment but wandered around, neglecting all household affairs. Despite repeated instruction, he dared to be disobedient and violent, and should be severely investigated. Chen Zhi Qiao, when questioned, stated that he was 23 years old and had been setting up a riddle stall in the New World amusement park in Beishi. Ms. Wu was indeed his biological mother, but she abandoned household matters and habitually engaged in certain dishonorable conduct that he was too ashamed to reveal. He claimed he was being falsely accused and begged for mercy. The Chief considered it a family matter involving a dispute between mother and son and ordered them to prepare documents to be transferred to the Shanghai District Court for investigation.</p>
<h3>A Cousin Should Not Match Up a Country Bumpkin</h3>
<p>Can a Cousin Take Charge?</p>
<p>Yesterday's Court Case Pursued</p>
<p>Qian Rongfa from Yangzhou has a daughter, Lian Gui, who works at the Dafeng Textile Factory in Zhabei, Shanghai, and thus lives with Qian's cousin, Qian Guishan. Qian had previously betrothed his daughter to someone in their hometown and recently came to Shanghai to take his daughter back to their hometown for the wedding. Unexpectedly, Qian Guishan hid his cousin and refused to let her be taken back, saying that his cousin was a beautiful woman and there was no need to marry a country bumpkin. He would take charge and find her another marriage. Qian Rongfa was enraged upon hearing this, believing there was no such principle in the world, so he took Qian Guishan to the Fourth District police station and handed him over to Qian Lian Gui. Yesterday, they were transferred to the District Court for review.</p>
<h3>Arrest for Kidnapping a Daughter</h3>
<p>Zhu Ruimao from Gaoyou, residing at No. 43 Dale Lane, Xiangyan Bridge, Hongkou, has a daughter, Qiao Di Zi, who is thirteen years old and works in a silk factory. On the 25th of last month, she returned home for lunch and went back to the factory after the meal. A fellow villager from Xinghua, Wu Xiaopizi, was having lunch and saw the girl leave. He stopped eating, left through the back door, and returned two hours later. That evening, the foreman from the factory told Zhu that his daughter had not been at work that afternoon. Zhu was terrified and searched everywhere but could not find her. Wu told Zhu's wife that he could find Qiao Di Zi, but he needed thirty yuan. Zhu's wife had no money, so she kowtowed repeatedly. Wu agreed to help, but more than a month passed without any news. A blind man from Xinghua in the neighborhood, whose wife had also recently run away, discovered that Wu had lured her away. He gathered many men and beat Wu, forcing him to hand her over. Wu had to lead them to where she was hidden and return her. After this incident, Zhu Ruimao recalled Wu's past behavior and concluded that Qiao Di Zi had been kidnapped by Wu. He filed a complaint with the Third Sub-station in the Fifth District, and Wu was arrested. During the interrogation, Wu denied the charges. Yesterday, he was ordered to be sent to the District Court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Disturbances from Late-Night Wife Seeking</h3>
<p>At two o'clock yesterday morning, the police siren on Hanzhong Road in Zhabei blared wildly, and there was a lot of noise. The patrol officer there thought there must be something wrong because of the late-night disturbance, so he went in the direction of the noise with his gun. He saw a man grabbing a young woman in a single layer of clothing, barefoot with disheveled hair, struggling to break free. He questioned them closely and learned that it was a marital dispute. He took the five men and women to the Fourth District Headquarters. The head officer questioned Yu Bao Cheng, a man from Taizhou who lives at No. 7 Dean Lane, Wuzhen Road, who said that his wife, Ms. Wang, had been married for two years, and they were a stable couple with deep affection. However, in January of this year, she was instigated by her mother, Wang Gao, to run away without a trace. It has been several months with no news, and he was extremely anxious. He hired people to search everywhere, and finally learned of her whereabouts yesterday. He rushed over that night and saw his wife sleeping soundly in bed with her mother, so he dragged her out, intending to take her home. Unexpectedly, her mother led many people, trying to take her back, so he sounded the siren for help. According to Ms. Wang, 23 years old, she and Yu are indeed a married couple. He treated her very well when they were first married, but since this year, he has not provided for her, so she is temporarily living with her mother. She did not expect him to come in the middle of the night and drag her out from the quilt. She does not want to grow old with such a rude man. According to Wang Gao, 61 years old, her son-in-law has recently abused her daughter, and she could not bear to see her daughter suffer, so she allowed her to stay and eat at her place, hoping that her son-in-law would repent and take her back to live together. She did not expect him to make noise in the middle of the night, disturbing the neighbors. According to Gao's sister, Liu Gao, and the cohabiting Su Wang, they got up to see what was happening when they heard the police siren and do not know what was going on. Head Officer Jin reviewed the statements and instructed them to be handed over to the judicial section for review, as the case involved a marital dispute.</p>
<h3>French Woman Injured by Car</h3>
<p>Rickshaw Puller Not Without Fault</p>
<p>French woman, Madame Blarès, filed a lawsuit in the French Court through her lawyer, stating that the plaintiff was riding in a rickshaw last month at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road in the Public Concession, when it was violently hit by a car driven by Yu Kaitang. The car overturned, causing the plaintiff to fall and suffer serious injuries. She was taken to the hospital for treatment and has not yet fully recovered. The plaintiff believes that the defendant driver was negligent and caused the injury, and is filing a lawsuit seeking investigation and compensation for losses and medical expenses. The defendant, Yu Kitang, stated that the plaintiff's car was traveling from south to north when it arrived. The rickshaw was turning west, mistakenly entering the path and bumped into the rear wheels of my car. At that time, the plaintiff was taken to the hospital for treatment by the people. The doctor said that she was slightly injured and there was no major problem. It was the fault of the rickshaw. Please investigate, etc. Chinese and Western officials ordered them to leave and await the ruling.</p>

<h3>Chinese Youth</h3>
<p>Asia Walking Group Established</p>
<p>Inaugural Meeting Held, Constitution and Declaration Approved</p>
<p>Elected Group Members and Duties, Preparing for Ten Thousand Li Trek</p>
<p>The Chinese Youth Asia Walking Group, which has been preparing for more than a month, has gradually resolved various difficult problems of long-distance walking through the joint research and efforts of participating comrades. The group held a grand inaugural meeting at the group's temporary office on the afternoon of the 18th of this month. More than 100 people including all group members and representatives from all walks of life and social enthusiasts attended. After performing the rituals, Feng Binghun presided over the meeting and Huang Yue recorded the minutes, passing the agenda, declaration, and outline. Then elections were held. Li Mengsheng was elected as the group leader and director of photography, Feng Binghun was elected as the deputy group leader and director of propaganda, Huang Yue was elected as the director of art, Cui Xiaoqiong and Cai Mengbin were elected as deputy directors, Hu Sujuan was elected as the director of social affairs, Qiu Langming was elected as the director of general affairs, and Wang Xiahun was elected as the director of records. Next, guests from all walks of life gave speeches, mostly encouraging the group's ten thousand li trek and efforts to move forward. Finally, the meeting was dismissed with tea and photography. It is reported that in addition to the above eight people who decided to actually participate in the long-distance walk, the remaining comrades will stay in Shanghai to be responsible for the group's propaganda and communication. The departing group members are currently busy preparing their luggage and handling various procedures. The responsible person has also been nominated to submit a report to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government regarding the registration with the local administrative authorities. Once the passports are received, the departure date will be selected and preparations will be made to set off. The group's declaration is recorded below:</p>
<p>For more than fifty years, the Chinese nation, which has carried the burden of civilization and creation, has also produced many adventurers and walkers in its long-term continuous development, adding glorious material to our history. Unfortunately, in modern times, especially when our political and social systems have not yet been fully established, apathy and decadence have become a common mental illness among young people. All great ambitions of perseverance, courage, and outstanding talent have been eliminated from the decadent lives of our youth. We feel that the spirit of the times has already cheered us. We feel that the time has come to unceremoniously shoulder this great burden. Our small group, although small in number and not rich in financial resources, is determined to set off from Shanghai with a persevering and courageous spirit and move forward, gradually realizing our destination. In every step, we must show the glory of the great Chinese national history. In every step, we must give society a profound impression until we reach the final point of our scheduled journey. This is our declaration.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Wangzhi Road Last Night</h3>
<p>Around 8 PM last night, five robbers speaking a Jiangbei dialect suddenly entered the Wang family's house at No. 128 Wangzhi Road, French Concession. Three of the robbers were armed with guns and told them to keep quiet. It is estimated that more than one hundred yuan worth of clothing and silver were stolen before they fled. The victim reported the situation to the police station and requested an arrest.</p>
<h3>Old Woman Killed by Car</h3>
<p>At about 7:30 yesterday morning, an old woman from Pudong came to Shanghai by ferry and was walking past the intersection of Renji Road. At that time, a cargo truck, No. 1942 of the Qiahe Air Conditioning Company on Minhang Road, driven by the driver Xia Linfa, had just left the China Merchants Bureau warehouse and was traveling from west to east. Because the car was driving too fast, it hit the old woman's head when it arrived, and she lost consciousness. Street patrol officer No. 5745 from the Lao Zha police station arrived, hired a car to take her to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, her injuries were too severe, and she died a quarter of an hour after arriving at the hospital.</p>
<h3>Liaoning Department of Finance</h3>
<p>Replaces Shanghai Cigarette Unified Tax Officer</p>
<p>The Dong Province authorities, in view of the scarcity of local Chinese cigarettes, telegraphed the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Federation last autumn, requesting them to send representatives to Liaoning to discuss the promotion of Chinese cigarettes and the method of assessing cigarette taxes. The results were satisfactory, and various Chinese cigarette factories shipped cigarettes for sale, amounting to about two or three thousand boxes per month. The Liaoning Department of Finance specially set up an office in Shanghai to respond to tax revenue matters and appointed Liu Guangpei, the secretary of the department, to be in charge of everything. Details have been recorded in previous reports. It is reported that the office has achieved remarkable results since its establishment, and Secretary Liu of the resident office has a harmonious relationship with the public. It is now known that Secretary Liu has been transferred back to the department due to other important matters, and Wu Rongchun will take over the office. The following is a transcript of the correspondence between the Liaoning Department of Finance and the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Federation:</p>
<p>(Titles omitted) We respectfully reply that we received your Department's Public Letter No. 200, stating that our Department previously established a Shanghai Unified Cigarette Tax Office and appointed Secretary Liu Guangpei to handle the affairs of the office, which has been notified. Now Liu Guangpei has been transferred to the department, and Wu Rongchun has been appointed to take over the remaining affairs. In addition to the separate notification, we respectfully request your Association to investigate and assist us at any time, etc.</p>
<p>Since Secretary Liu took charge of the Unified Cigarette Tax Office of the Department, he has been conscientious and harmonious with the public. There is no concern about barriers to business conditions, and tax revenue has benefited from comprehensive planning. Now that Secretary Liu has been promoted and returned to the department, we are all delighted to hear it. We are even more fortunate that Secretary Wu is wise and capable. We believe that tax revenue and business conditions will greatly depend on his service. Our Association will adhere to its original purpose, cooperate with all our hearts to benefit cigarette tax and maintain the cigarette industry.</p>
<p>Before receiving the letter, we dare to inform you of the enthusiasm of all Shanghai cigarette merchants for Secretary Liu and the earnest expectations of Secretary Wu. Please consider it.</p>
<h3>Pre-notice of the Art School Teacher and Student Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Chinese Art School on Qiqi Road, French Concession (formerly the Chinese Academy of Arts and Letters, renamed by order of the Ministry of Education), was founded by old hands in the Shanghai art circle, dedicated to the study of profound Chinese art and the training of specialized talents. It is divided into fine art departments and literature special programs. The professors hired are all famous contemporary artists. Teaching is effective, and results are remarkable. The teacher and student art exhibition will be held from the 24th to the 26th of this month (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) at the Ningbo Fellow Association on Xizang Road. There will be five or six hundred works on display, with a pure style that washes away the current fashion of wild and vulgar habits. In recent years, although art schools have been gradually established in China, they all focus on Western art, and this school is the first to focus on the study of Chinese art. Chinese society has always had a taste for art, and there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>Charity Society Shelters Girl Bitao</h3>
<p>The girl, Bitao, is twelve years old and from Shaozhou, Guangdong. When she was seven years old, she was sold to Guo Binghe's family in Shanghai as a maid due to her parents' poverty. For several years, her life was still decent. Last year, Guo's daughter married Mr. Zheng Yizhi of Wuding Road, and Bitao followed them to serve. However, Guo's daughter changed her original intention and often abused her. Mr. Zheng repeatedly advised her to stop but she became even more violent, kicking and punching Bitao. At the same time, she fell out with Mr. Zheng and could not live together, so they had divorced. However, Mr. Zheng thought that if Bitao returned with Guo's daughter, she would be abused again, and if he kept her, it would not be reasonable. Therefore, he consulted Lawyer Yao Yongli, asking for a solution. Lawyer Yao then suggested that making people slaves is illegal, so it would be better to let Bitao be free and temporarily ask the Chinese Child Welfare Association to shelter her so that she can be returned to her parents. After receiving the news, the association sent the staff member Wang Guan to shelter her in accordance with the regulations. Lawyer Yao formally introduced her, and both Guo and Zheng testified. If Bitao's parents come to claim her in the future, both parties must be present, and the parents must provide a bond that they will not sell her as a maid again, so that she can be reunited with her family.</p>
<h3>News from Various Labor Unions</h3>
<p>The National Seamen's Union and the Chinese Seamen's Union were founded by the Premier in Guangzhou. Its scope covers all personnel serving on ships (whether sail or motor) on rivers and oceans across the country, all of whom are seamen. It is now reported that the Central Government has divided civilian ships and formed another labor union. Therefore, all branches are extremely alarmed and sent representatives to Shanghai to discuss the matter. They telegraphed the Central Government to approve the jurisdiction of civilian ships to be returned to the Seamen's Union. The text is as follows:</p>
<p>To the Executive Committee Training Department Legal Compilation Committee of the Central Party Headquarters in the Capital:</p>
<p>We have repeatedly requested the Seamen's General Union to forward to the Central Government for review the case of unifying the water surface organization of the Seamen's Union. The representatives of the subordinate branches have also gone to Beijing to petition. Now we read in the newspapers that the Central Government has resolved the guidelines for reorganizing the Seamen's Union, and it is reported that there is a proposal to divide civilian ships and form another labor union. We cannot help but be alarmed. If civilian ships are divided, the basic organization of the Seamen's Union will be shaken. The membership fees of the civilian ship workers for more than ten years will be wasted, and resentment will inevitably arise. The country's reactionary elements will also take the opportunity to use civilian ships to secretly cultivate and grow. There are countless reasons for concern. What the heart says is dangerous, and reason is difficult to keep silent. The subordinate branches are compelled to send representatives to gather for discussion for the sake of the labor movement of seamen and for the future of the Party and the country, and to jointly telegraph for review, earnestly requesting that civilian ships still be under the jurisdiction of the Seamen's Union, so as to facilitate reorganization and prevent hidden dangers. We are most eagerly awaiting orders.</p>
<p>He Zhenhuan, representative of the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Seamen's Industrial Federation, Xu Feitang, representative of the Ningbo branch, Lin Rixi, representative of the Wenzhou branch, Lin Feng, representative of the Fuzhou branch, Ye Maozhi, representative of the Xiamen branch, Jian Rongshu, representative of the Guangdong branch, and Li Shaoxian, representative of the Shantou branch, kowtow and request.</p>

How should this be handled? It was resolved that due to limited finances, the implementation date will be decided at the next standing committee meeting.</p>
<p>(2) The organization of branches and other affairs is complicated. Should additional staff be hired? It was resolved that staff should be hired to assist in the process.</p>
<p>(3) There must be a small number of members who postpone and delay the payment of monthly fees. How should this be dealt with? It was resolved to submit it to the higher authorities for review.</p>

<p>A: This cow was bought jointly by you and me. Why did you sell it without asking my permission?</p>

<h3>A Record of Bowman's Affairs by Lu Shu Yun</h3>
<p>Some time ago, while in Shanghai, I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Douglas H. Bowman, a Westerner, through the introduction of Mr. Zhao Yizhai. Over two years, I deeply admired him. Recently, Mr. Zhao came to Beijing on business, and after a conversation, I learned that Mr. Bowman would be returning to his country with his wife within the month. Therefore, I am writing down several anecdotes about him to inform my fellow countrymen, and also to celebrate Mr. Bowman's departure.</p>
<p>Mr. Bowman is of Scottish nationality. He has been living in Shanghai for over twenty years. He is a handsome man, skilled in eloquence, and possesses deep self-confidence with resolute courage. When interacting with others, he is humble and courteous, without the arrogance of the English. Having lived in China for a long time, he deeply understands the situation of our country and has a special affection for the Chinese people. In his daily life, he strives to adopt Chinese customs. He once worked as the Shanghai correspondent for the London "Manchester Guardian," and whenever he discussed Chinese affairs, he always upheld justice and strongly refuted the Westerners' superficial and unfounded views. In particular, regarding the British warships' bombardment of Wanxian, he was particularly慷慨激昂, vehemently criticizing the massacre policy as inhumane, considering it a great disgrace to the British. At that time, ambitious figures in the British political circle were in uproar upon hearing this. As a result, he was deemed out of step with the times, and his views increasingly diverged from those in charge, leading him to resign in anger. He also once taught at a public school established by the Shanghai Municipal Council. After each class, he would gather his students and, in the Shanghai dialect, talk about the customs and sights of the world, mixing seriousness with humor, creating endless interest. Therefore, students particularly enjoyed his company. At the beginning of the European War, Mr. Bowman enlisted in the military and left Shanghai to return to England, where he was sent to the European continent to participate in the war. He repeatedly achieved minor successes in battles. While fighting on the French border, he encountered a Spanish woman. Their feelings were deeply entangled, and their passion soared. He immediately proposed marriage to her. However, this woman already had a lover who had been lost in the war, and was mistakenly reported dead. Later, Mr. Bowman happened to meet her rival in love somewhere. They told each other their life stories, and he suddenly realized that Luo Fu already had a husband. Her rival, feeling that Mr. Bowman was stealing his love, demanded a duel. According to custom, a duel between rivals in love was inevitable. However, Mr. Bowman婉言谢绝ed this duel, willingly conceding. Although many people at the time ridiculed him for this, Mr. Bowman remained cheerful and unperturbed. His selflessness and consideration for others were truly beyond reach. Soon, his rival was also moved by his actions and felt uneasy. He found a girlfriend for Mr. Bowman and strongly urged them to get together. This is Mr. Bowman's current wife. Later, he returned to Shanghai with his wife and was hired as the Shanghai agent for the Han Kee Seng Company of San Francisco. In his spare time, he enjoyed visiting his Chinese friends and engaging in passionate discussions. He often said that China today is plagued by internal turmoil, and the people's livelihood is declining. If it does not awaken and strive for strength, the future of the nation will be worrying. However, in all things, it is better to rely on oneself than on others. The lip service of others is unreliable. China's inherent culture has persisted for four or five thousand years without decline. Its value can be imagined. If it can be promoted and expanded, it will dominate the world. It is also within expectations. Moreover, the Chinese people are physically strong and accustomed to hard work. Whether in cold or tropical regions, they can resist their environment and have more than enough. Their natural endowments are also superior, beyond the reach of white people. It is often seen that foreigners who learn Chinese often stammer and cannot fully express themselves. However, Chinese people who speak foreign languages can often be proficient and fluent, talking and laughing with ease. Moreover, Chinese people can wear Western suits and add to their noble demeanor. However, if you try to put a long gown and mandarin jacket on a white person, it would be ridiculous and out of place, and no one would not laugh at it. How profound! Even the structure of the vocal cords and the wearing of clothing cannot be forced in this way. However, the Chinese people also have a bad habit, namely, that people generally have the mentality of "sweeping the snow in front of their own door." They believe in non-intervention and regard complacency and timidity as virtues. This is not permitted by the modern principle of the survival of the fittest. I sincerely hope that the Chinese people can catch up quickly, strive for self-improvement, and not entrust everything to fate. Then, after thousands of years, it will not be difficult to turn weakness into strength. Thus, Mr. Bowman's understanding of our country can be said to be profound and his expectations are earnest. Now that Mr. Bowman is about to return to his country, I am writing this to encourage my fellow countrymen.</p>
<h3>Thus Have I Heard by a Visitor Who Washed His Eyes and Came Again</h3>
<p>More than ten days have passed since the Buddha's Birthday. Yesterday, a visitor came from the lower reaches of the river, recounting various interesting events during the Buddha's Birthday. These should not be forgotten, so I am writing them down to bring a smile to the readers' faces. The visitor, Mr. Liu, is from Yancheng. He described several events, and I will record two of them.</p>
<p>The visitor said that in the lower reaches of the river, Rugao County is the most devout in Buddhism. There is a woman named Zhang in the county, a widow who is over fifty years old. She eats vegetarian food, chants scripture, and relies solely on the Buddha. Her neighbor, Gu San, is middle-aged and childless. He took in a concubine a year ago. The dream of having a child has not yet materialized, and quarrels occur from time to time. This is also common, and there is nothing strange about it. However, the concubine suddenly developed a disease of the river fish within a month. Sometimes, she would have a sudden and violent bowel movement. At other times, she would have drips and drabs. Her appetite sharply declined, and she became haggard and pitiful. However, the wife stroked her and said, "This girl has disobeyed me. I would rather scold her than abuse her while she is sick." However, the concubine was clever. She asked Zhang to chant the Diamond Sutra to confess her sins. She said, "In the past, my mother committed a deceitful act, and a high monk directly revealed her secret and predicted her death. It came true. Now, I dare not hide my illness. I have not been obedient to the wife. I will change in the future." She then recounted certain matters that were unfavorable to the wife and certain words that made the husband resent the wife. She also said, "I am afraid, I am afraid. The Buddha's Birthday is near. The Buddha's eyes are penetrating. Therefore, I am telling the wife to reduce my sins." Upon hearing this, Zhang's forehead was covered in sweat. She put her palms together and bowed, saying, "It is I, it is I." Zhang recalled the secret affairs of that year, acting out of jealousy and poisoning the concubine's food with purgatives, endangering her. Zhang is foolish and pitiful, while the concubine is cunning and intelligent.</p>
<p>The visitor also said that the wealthy Hu Zimin lived in a village between Tongzhou and Rugao. He was a pious man and believed in Buddhism like an old woman. This year, during the Buddha's Birthday, he collected a large number of fish, shrimp, and clams, and instructed a servant boy to release them. Before this, there were three or five laborers in Zimin's house who gathered in the tea market, sighing and lamenting. At that time, the servant boy had not yet entered the Hu family. When asked, they said, "The master is尖刻. He provides himself with extremely rich food. The sound of chanting scriptures in the quiet room corresponds to the sound of carving and cleaning in the kitchen. We never get to taste a single bite all year round. Even if there is leftover food in the height of summer, he will not give it to others. He would rather let it rot and pour it into the river." The boy said, "Please recommend me. I will surely be able to fill your bellies." Three days before the Buddha's Birthday, a mendicant monk came to the door, pointing out that he had killed too many creatures and that if he did not release a large number of creatures on the Buddha's Birthday, there would surely be disaster. He then massaged him with his hands. He groaned in pain wherever he pressed. The monk said, "You have accumulated obstacles. Disaster is not far away." Zimin was terrified and begged for help. The monk said, "If you agree to release the creatures, there will be no problem." He then stroked him again. Indeed, it did not hurt. This is how the release of creatures came about. The monk was the boy's uncle. Half of the released creatures ended up in the bellies of those laborers, and the other half was exchanged for money to give to the monk. Zheng Xiaoren has a new body.</p>
<h3>A Particularly Interesting Cat-Dog Lawsuit by Huang Ying Dai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, I received a letter from a friend in Beiping, saying that a cat-dog lawsuit recently occurred in the city of Beiping, which was particularly interesting. I am recording the details below.</p>
<p>There is a man named Wang Delin in Beiping who kept a cat at home, which he cared for with utmost care. Unexpectedly, the cat went out one day and was bitten to death by a neighbor's dog. Delin was filled with grief and went to his neighbor's house to negotiate with the dog's owner. The dog's owner was a widow. On the spot, he proposed a condition: the widow must purchase a coffin for the cat's burial, and during the burial, the widow's son must wear mourning clothes and follow behind the cat's coffin as a son in mourning. The widow, upon hearing this, immediately bought a wooden coffin for two silver dollars and hired two porters to carry the coffin to the suburbs to dig a grave and bury it. However, the matter of her son acting as a son in mourning was difficult to handle. Her son was already twenty years old, and even if the widow agreed, he would not be willing to wear mourning clothes for a cat. However, Wang refused to agree, saying that if the widow's son did not wear mourning clothes and follow behind the coffin, he would see them in court. The matter was heard by the neighbors. A man named Zhang, a famous martial arts master with great strength, felt indignant upon hearing this news. He went to the widow's house to comfort her and told her not to comply with these harsh conditions. On the other hand, he went to Wang Delin's house to dissuade him. Wang was furious upon hearing this, thinking that this matter had nothing to do with Zhang and that Zhang had no right to intervene. In the ensuing dispute, they even resorted to violence. As a result, Wang Delin was severely beaten by Zhang and suffered heavy injuries. The police, upon hearing this, quickly took the two men into the police station. The widow and her son were also summoned to testify. They have now been sent to court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Record of a Butterfly Society's Recording Session by Xin Xin</h3>
<p>Singing and dancing are declining day by day, almost equivalent to street performances. It has become a common sight to see women performing beach songs and dance troupes mixed together in festive gatherings. This is also something that Li Jinhui did not expect. The Butterfly Singing Society has always been a leader in the singing and dancing world. Its members are all well-known ladies from respectable families. They have performed at the City Hall and the French Park in the past, and have received enthusiastic welcome from the society. Therefore, its reputation is the best among the various singing and dancing societies. Recently, due to the changes of the times, the society decided not to follow the example of the peers and refused to perform. The social desires has already lasted two years, but it is not just thousands. There is a Beikai Company admireing the reputation of the society. It invited the painter Ding Song to discuss recording with the society in order to promote art. Due to friendship, the society readily accepted the task. The songs "Double Butterflies" and "Parting" were recorded last Saturday, gathering more than a dozen musicians and ladies Ye and Lu. The tunes are clear and the silk and bamboo instruments are melodious. It can be regarded as the best production in the singing and dancing films. More than a hundred people visited and listened to the singing on that day. It was a grand occasion.</p>
<p>Brief News The Changzhou Bin Society's ticket office has been established for more than four years. It is scheduled to sing in the Old Government Office Hall for three days on the 16th, 17th, and 18th of this month. Zhang Xiao傖 has invited Ms. Chang'e, a female ticket friend from Shanghai, to Changzhou to sing "Hongluanxi," "Golden Lock Record," "Female Qi Xie," "Cosmic Front," "Fenhe Bay," and "Meilong Town." In addition, Zhang Zikuan will sing "Water Flooding the Seven Armies," "Beating the Nephew's Grave," "Qingding Pearl," and "Asking Qiao to Make Trouble in the Government." He Yukun will sing "June Snow," "Yutangchun Fights at Puguan," and Zhang Xiao傖 will sing "Baolian Lantern" and "Catching and Releasing Puguan." Wang Chunfang will sing "Ascending to Heaven," "Fa塲 Changing Son," and "Xiaoyao Jin." Wang Yinong will sing the complete "Strange Injustice Reported" and "Li Ling Stele." Gong Yizhen will sing "Checking the Pass," Cheng Jimei will sing "Dongjia Mountain" and "Tao Yu Tax." Gu Bocheng will sing "Stabbing King Liao," "Exploring Yinyang Mountain," "Muhuguan," and "Caoqiaoguan." Gu Borun will sing "Flower Drum," "Hongni Guan," and "Joining the Army." All are famous for a time.</p>
<h3>A Noteworthy Statistic by Sheng</h3>
<p>The farmland in the south mostly relies on lakes and marshes for irrigation. However, in the north, lakes and marshes are scarce, so there is a risk of famine in dry years. Liezi said that humans can conquer nature. This is very reasonable. Recently, the north has been paying attention to well digging. The more wells dug, the more secure the farmland. Even if there is a drought, there will be a way to remedy it. According to investigators, Ding County in Hebei Province has the most wells in the north. In Zhaicheng Village in Ding County alone, there are ninety-six wells in the village and two hundred and ninety-four wells outside the village. On average, there is one well per household in the village. In addition to providing drinking water, each well can also irrigate twenty to thirty acres of land, or even forty acres. In addition to Zhaicheng Village, there are a total of six thousand two hundred and eight wells in the sixty-two villages. Approximately, each village has one hundred wells. In other words, every two households have the convenience of one well for irrigation. It can be imagined. Therefore, many people say that if the north were as enthusiastic about digging wells as Ding County, it would not suffer from drought for years. It is said that the China International Famine Relief Commission and the China Educational Improvement Society are working hard to expand well digging. This is indeed good news for the north.</p>

<p>Episode 11: Cui Luo and Zhu Qiao, the Beautiful Woman Returns; Jia Shi and Qing Lu, Crimson Tents, Famous Meeting Famous Families</p>
<p>At that time, Zuo Shichen asked him, "You took on this job. When are you going to do it? I see that you have eight hours of work at the bookstore during the day, and you have to go to the newspaper office at night, often not returning until ten o'clock. Where will you have the time?" Liu Xing Shu said, "There is plenty of time. At the newspaper office, by nine o'clock in the evening, the evening paper and Reuters telegrams can actually be finished. The remaining time is just chatting and talking. From now on, after I finish my work, I will rush home to translate, translating from ten o'clock to one o'clock. I have three hours of work to do, and I can translate a lot of words. Because my sleeping time is a little shorter than others. Others need to sleep for eight hours, and some even need to sleep for ten hours. I don't need to sleep for so many hours. I probably only need to sleep for six hours a day." Zuo Shichen shook his head and said, "It's too hard after all." Liu Xing Shu said, "We actually have a lot of time, but we waste most of it on weekdays. For example, Sunday is a day off and I don't have to go to the bookstore. There is nothing to translate from Western newspapers or telegrams. In the past, I would just take a nap, see friends, or go to various places for a walk. I would eat at small restaurants every night. A Sunday would just pass like that. Now I use Sunday as my own time and continue to work as usual, working at my own home. I can translate a lot of words. Although Sunday is one day out of seven, there are still four Sundays in a month. Furthermore, during the day at the bookstore, I am paid by the hour and I am completely doing their work. At night at the newspaper office, if there is something to translate, I cannot miss it. Tomorrow people will have this news and we won't, which will cause the newspaper to suffer losses. If there is nothing to translate, or I am sitting and waiting for the Reuters telegram to arrive, in this gap, it is just a few colleagues chatting and laughing. I can take my translation with me during this free time and translate it whenever I have the chance. Isn't this taking advantage of time?" Zuo Shichen said, "It's too hard after all. One cannot work all day long. One must have a break. I agree with the regulations set by foreigners now. A day and night is twenty-four hours. Divide it into eight hours of work, eight hours of rest and play, and eight hours of sleep. This is the most appropriate allocation of twenty-four hours. Everyone can do it. You say that the sleeping time only needs six hours. I say that it is too little. I need eight hours. Although there are many people with extraordinary energy who only need to sleep four or five hours a day, this is an exception. On average, it is still most appropriate to sleep eight hours a day. Furthermore, one's period of recreation is also necessary. Otherwise, if one works all day long without any relaxation, how can one do it?"</p>

<h3>Commercial News</h3>
<p>The Value of Foreign Silver Cents is Declining</p>
<p>Market Overview: In recent years, Shanghai banknotes have been flooded. For the convenience of carrying them, people in various places prefer banknotes to silver coins. Therefore, no matter how prosperous the use of silver coins may be, banknotes must occupy a part of them. The position of silver coins has almost been seized by banknotes, and most of the silver coins are stored in warehouses and do not circulate. If there is a weak trend, the value of silver coins will fall. This is to be expected. At present, the demand for silk and tea is lax, but the supply is abundant, which led to yesterday's drop in price.</p>
<p>Value of Silver Cents: The "Foreign Silver Cent" market was increasingly soft, and prices continued to fall. The closing price was 7 cents, 1 point, 8 mills, 8 hairs, and 7 flakes and a half. The afternoon market was weaker by 1 hair and 2 flakes and a half, at 7 cents, 1 point, 8 mills, and 7 flakes and a half. From now on, it will be difficult for the value of silver cents to reach 2 points again. "Silver Taels": The demand for silver funds was equivalent to the silver price, which was generally stable. The early and afternoon markets were unified at 1 cent and 3 points, which was slightly lower than the previous day by 2 points. However, the head 槻 was still not lax and excessive, so the market price for adding water to the 　 head was still 5 points. The bank's listing price was also 5 points.</p>
<p>Circulation of Auxiliary Coins: The use of small silver coins in Jiangnan was sluggish, and the market price was also soft. The early market was 6 cents, 3 points, and 4 mills, which was lower than the previous day by 2 mills and a half. The afternoon market rose again to 3 points and 7 mills, making a transaction. The early market was 1,500 cents, and the afternoon market was 4,000 cents. Small silver coins in Guangdong also fell due to sluggish sales. The early market was 6 cents, 0 point, 1 mill, and 7 hairs and a half. The afternoon market was 6 cents, 0 point, and 1 mill and a half. The early market made a transaction of 165,000 cents, and the afternoon market made a transaction of 50,000 cents. The copper coins fell short by 1,500 yuan, to 413,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Inflow and Outflow of Silver Dollars: "Silver Funds": Yesterday, the bank's collection and settlement were very simple. Chinese merchants collected and settled more than 2.3 million banknotes, foreign merchants collected and settled more than 1.5 million banknotes, silk and cocoon funds were more than 300,000, telegraphic transfer funds were more than 500,000, and various goods, exchange taxes, and miscellaneous funds were collected and settled 8,670,000. One million was taken out of the warehouse. Japanese banks collected and settled various funds of 2,890,000, and 700,000 were put into the warehouse. The amount collected and settled by the money houses and silver public was higher than usual, totaling more than 37.7 million. The amount collected and settled by 劃 head was more than 4.1 million, and the amount collected and settled by various remittance routes was more than 900,000. The amount collected in cash was several hundred thousand. "Foreign Funds": The early market made a transaction of 1,525,000 foreign exchange banknotes, and the afternoon market made a transaction of 777,000. There was no market for banknotes in the early market, and 20,000 in the afternoon market. The off-market banknotes were 110,000 in the early market and 65,000 in the afternoon market. In the early market, banks traded 500,000 foreign funds with each other, and in the afternoon market, they traded 450,000. The inflow and outflow of foreign households in various banks was more than 1.1 million, and the inflow and outflow of banknotes was more than 1 million. The amount collected and settled by the money houses was more than 5.7 million. The amount collected and settled for the foreign 劃 head was more than 1.4 million. The amount of foreign funds borrowed and loaned was more than 1.2 million. The inflow and outflow of small money houses was more than 600,000. The source of various ports was more than 800,000. There was no news about the stomach.</p>
<h3>The Gold Market is Dominated by the Air</h3>
<p>Turbulent Waves... There are Fluctuations of Six or Seven Taels</p>
<p>Wandering and Confused... The Industry's Buying and Selling is Without a Definite Purpose</p>
<p>The Key to Rising and Falling is the Silver Tax Issue: Yesterday's gold market still had very big changes. The ups and downs were unpredictable and great. The high and low of several taels were not surprising. The chaos of the market was difficult to grasp. The psychology of the industry was still unintentional. The extreme wandering was indeed dominated by the air. The front market had nine taels of twists and turns. The rear market also had more than five taels of changes. The foreign exchange was loose at first and then tight. The transactions of each company were still strong, but the purchases and sales were different. Fuchang, Yu Da, and Taixing all bought in. Zhifengyong, Yongchengchang, and Yuanxingyong had sold out. The big players did not move from the early market's continuous decline. In fact, it was said that the National Government was considering implementing the issue of paying taxes with silver. Therefore, people were very afraid and opened a low market, plummeting six or seven taels. Afterwards, there were sudden changes. At noon, it was rumored that the silver tax was canceled, and it suddenly soared, jumping up six or seven taels again. The exchange rate was also quite beautiful. In the afternoon, the buying and selling of each company was chaotic and uncertain. The waves were very dangerous. At first, it broke 520 taels, which was due to the crowding of sellers. However, the exchange rate was firm and not loose, jumping four or five taels. It once rose to more than 524 taels. Finally, the atmosphere suddenly turned bad, and the selling was very strong. The result of the 4-tael plunge turned flat, between 521 taels.</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange is Incomparably Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver markets in Britain, the United States, India, etc., all trended to low peaks, but the exchange rates and the market prices in Yokohama and Kobe today did not have glory or disgrace. The market was loose and dull. The HSBC listings were the same as the previous day after the second change and reduction. However, the bank's internal market seemed to weaken in the morning, and then tended to be tight. There were ups and downs in the afternoon, and finally the price rose sharply. However, the gold market was extremely chaotic, changing suddenly and greatly, and there were changes of more than 11 taels, which made it difficult to speculate. It was actually disturbed by the issue of silver tax collection. As a result, each exchange rate was compared to the previous day, and the discount was 25%, the US dollar was reduced by half a yuan, and the Japanese gold rose by half a point. Chinese businessmen had some to sell, and also wanted to settle, but the bank saw the heart firm, not easy to get, and the appetite was not idle, almost forming a confrontation. It is estimated that more than 200,000 pounds were traded, including 100,000 pounds made by each bank, and Chinese businessmen sold to Shanghai, Maihang, Korea, HSBC, Sumitomo, etc. However, only Guangdong had a slight sale, and the US dollar transaction was very little, and the Japanese gold had sold more than 1 million yuan, and banks such as Sumitomo, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, etc. had some inflows, and Datong and ICBC sold a little. The market atmosphere was incomparably tight.</p>

<h3>Silver Price's Frightful Decline</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's London telegraph, the price of silver bullion is falling sharply day by day, all seeing new records. Recently it has shrunk by 25, and has also retreated into the 19 pence range, to 18 pence 75 (equivalent to one shilling ten pence one eight seven five in British gold). The forward price has also shrunk by 25, to 18 pence 6875. The origin is China and India selling off, with few buyers. India is also buying when the price is low to level the market. Also received a New York telegraph, the US silver price has also shrunk by 125, to 4.0625 dollars. The exchange rate between Britain and the US remains unchanged, still at 4 dollars 8 angles 5 fen 96875. The exchange rate between the US and Britain is still calculated at 4 dollars 8 angles 6 fen. The exchange rate between Japan and the US is still 49 yuan 4375. The British buying and selling price is still calculated at 2 shillings 040625. The British Shanghai shilling short is 3125, to 1 shilling 0125. The Bombay spot price has shrunk by 9 ounces, to 52 rupees 14 ounces. Also, Reuters and electric communication both report no changes.</p>
<p>Securities Level Off at 96, Turning from Low to High</p>
<p>The opening price of the front market 96 spot in Beiping was 161, the closing price was 16275, sales were 155,000.

(Telegraph from the 20th)</p>
<h3>Bond Prices Decline Slightly, Trend Calm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market situation in the local securities market, the futures market suddenly turned calm. The buying and selling activity was far less than before. There were no transactions in the spot market in the morning, and only dispatching in the afternoon. There were slight transactions in disaster relief. As for the changes in the prices of various bonds, the market situation turned clear, the surrounding environment was dull, the supply and demand situation was very balanced, and the market price also revolved with little change. Internal matters such as continued large-scale troop reductions and continued rolling over only fluctuated by one or two jiao. Other changes were only four or five jiao, slightly looser than the previous day. It is estimated that the total turnover of futures for the whole day was more than 6.9 million, and the opening price of the spot market was 7,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton, Current Yarn Sales Smooth</h3>
<p>The situation in the yarn market remains largely unchanged. The overseas market is uniformly trending downwards, but the local market has not been significantly affected, due to the sluggish transaction. However, the environment is still poor. Only the buyer's attitude is stable and unchanged. The seller also has no intention of rushing to compensate, so the market atmosphere is still maintained. I am afraid that there will be no extremely large ups and downs for the time being. Currently, Qingdao's yarn sales are smooth, with local yarn accounting for the majority. The selling price of Japanese yarn is gradually falling. There are stocks of 20-count Limashi and 16-count Blue Phoenix yarn, and the market is gradually trending down.</p>
<p>Renbiao Lichanghao is opening up the forward and distant yarn market in the front market. The market atmosphere is flat and weak. American cotton is trending down. Retail investors are selling to close out, and the situation is relatively loose. Three-grade yarn has fallen again, with each month falling by one or two cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that the sales of current yarn are still healthy, and the market atmosphere has slightly improved. Sixty-six swap, forward and distant, the market remains unchanged. Each has risen by one cent, but the closing price of three-grade yarn has fallen again. The total transaction volume for the whole day is estimated at 6,250 bales. The closing prices of Renbiao are recorded on the left. Renbiao Closing Price Rise and Fall Account Balance August 152.7 Down 121,350 5th month 152.1 Down 129,950 September 155.6 212,500 June 152.2 130,550 October 154.2 Up 1 6,850 July 152.5 326,300</p>
<p>More than 1,000 bales of Qingdao's forward yarn are selling better. It is found that all gangs bought 2,445 bales of spot and futures goods throughout the day. Among the customer gangs, Qingdao's forward goods accounted for the largest number, with 1,130 bales. In addition, Sichuan purchased 500 bales, Guangdong purchased 240 bales, the mainland purchased 50 bales, Qinhuangdao purchased 25 bales, Xiamen purchased 80 bales, Tianjin purchased 225 bales, Hankou purchased 55 bales, Jinan purchased 60 bales, Gaoyang purchased 20 bales, and miscellaneous gangs purchased 60 bales.</p>
<h3>Han Standard Near and Far Alike Weary</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending down, mainly because American cotton has turned weak, and the local people's hearts have softened. Hengda's bulls sell out every time they buy, and the market is quite loose. The far month is affected, and Han Gang's far month has slightly sold out. The sales of current cotton in the market are quite stagnant. Each factory is suffering from the sluggish yarn market, and Indian cotton is saturated, with no progress at all. In fact, it is difficult to expect development for a while.</p>
<p>Futures Cotton Bulls Close Out Han Standard Front Market Opens, Market Atmosphere Still Firm, Buyers Hold Steady, Slightly Looser in Two or Three Plates, Bulls Close Out Each Down 5 Cents to 1 Cent. In the afternoon, Hengda still sells, but the 18th enters 1,000 dan in October, so the market atmosphere is more expensive. As a result, each fell by 5 cents to 1 cent. The total transaction volume for the whole day is estimated at 24,400 dan. The closing prices of Han Standard are recorded on the left.</p>

<h3>Overseas Yarn and Cotton All Fall</h3>
<p>American Cotton Bulls Close Out Yesterday, American Cotton was initially firm due to bad weather, but later weakened due to the weakness of Wall Street and the closing out of bulls. It is estimated that futures fell by 18 to 29 pounds per tone, and spot goods fell by 20 pounds per tone. British cotton futures rose by 8 to 11 points, and spot goods rose by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by 15 points. Indian cotton market closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegraph from the 19th)</p>

<p>Silk and Tea, European and American Telegraphs Transfer Silk Prices Quite Low</p>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm silk market still lacked a new development trend. Although there was a transfer from overseas silk telegraphs to Shanghai, the price was low. Chinese merchants believed that the price of new cocoons was high and the cost was not loose, so negotiations were difficult to reach. Yesterday, only Ganli entered 50 bales of medium-grade Shanghai factory silk in June, and Kaili entered 20 bales of yellow factory silk. The price did not rise.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing Cocoon Prices Gradually Rise</h3>
<p>New cocoons from various villages in Jiaxing have been successively listed on the market. The cocoon companies have started weighing for four or five days. The initial price of cocoons was only 50 to 54.5 yuan. Later, due to the competition among various companies to collect high-quality cocoons, improved high-grade goods have opened at 64 yuan, and ordinary goods are also 56 yuan. The price demanded by silkworm farmers is relatively high, and the cocoon body is still excellent. The market outlook is bullish.</p>
<h3>Tunxi New Tea Opens One After Another</h3>
<p>The mountain households in the rest of the area have recently finished collecting all the gardens of new tea. However, the production volume has sharply decreased, and there is a feeling that the supply is insufficient. Currently, various companies in the Tunxi market are rushing to pick new tea and have sent personnel to tea-producing areas in Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi to purchase. A large amount of new tea has been transported from Dexing, Yushan, Suian, Huabu, Wuyuan, Shexian, and other places in recent days, opening new discs, ranging from 60 yuan to more than 80 yuan. However, there are very few high-grade, delicate goods, and the appetite of the brand-name companies is not very comfortable. Currently, there are more than 40 tea companies in the Tunxi market, which is one-third less than in previous years. Although the market appears lively, brand-name merchants are mostly pessimistic about the increase in expenses due to the opening of prices in Zishan.</p>
<p>This year, the mountain households in Deyi County picked new tea of both high and low grades earlier. In the bandit-free areas, the gardens were opened one after another around Guyu. Therefore, there are many tender heads of tea buds and raw materials for making Zhenmei. Tunxi tea companies, due to the lack of local tea production, have been searching and buying in Dexing. The new tea from Shujiabao has been opened by Tunxi customers, with a disc price of 65 yuan. Wuyuan tea companies have also been searching and buying in various villages in Dexing, because the tea from Dexing is tender and delicate, and they have purchased and transported a lot in recent days, with a disc price ranging from 60 to 70 yuan. In addition, the new tea from Dexing has recently been opened by Yushan tea companies in large quantities, with a disc price ranging from 40 yuan to 50 yuan. However, local tea companies, due to the rampant banditry, Dexing and Haikou shops are closed. The original tea companies that were prepared to open the market are now closed, and only two places, Xinjian and Dingcun, each have a tea company that has already opened the market. (14th)</p>
<h3>Wuyuan Tea Prices Plummet by 20 Yuan</h3>
<p>After the new tea from Wuyi County was searched and purchased by various companies, the mountain households believed that the cost was too high and would not sell unless the price was high. Therefore, the companies held on for several days, and the opening of the market was very rare. Except for Qinghua, Daicun, and Zhishan, which offered 80 yuan, the rest were unwilling to open the market. Currently, the companies believe that the mountain price is too high, tea goods are difficult to handle, and rice is scarce. The opening price of Zhenmei in the Shanghai local market is more than ten taels lower than before. Therefore, the attitude of tea merchants has suddenly turned negative, and they all advocate buying less and handling a batch to end the market. The market has become cold. Seeing that the companies are not interested, the mountain households are willing to comply. Yesterday, Shuntai Tea Company opened the market in Xinyuan Sisi and set the price at 62 yuan. Yanchuan was purchased by the local village tea company and set the price at 60 yuan. The opening price in the Taibai area of ​​Nanxiang was set at 55 yuan, which was 20 yuan lower than the new disc a few days ago. At this price, the mountain households only cover the cost. Tea companies believe that this disc price is still low and are searching and purchasing one after another. It is expected that a large number of markets will open in the near future. The biggest difficulty for the tea companies at present is the current ocean and rice. Yesterday, the ticket price soared to 1,342 yuan, and it is even more difficult to obtain rice. Tea workers have already felt the lack of food. Therefore, each company is extremely anxious about these two difficult problems. (12th)</p>
<p>Grain, Rice Market Stalled Due to Rain</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sources arriving from both the north and south were few. The local market was quiet because of the cloudy and rainy morning, which caused both buyers and sellers to wait and see. The market exchange was as if it were halted because the river measure was difficult to open. The highest price of white japonica rice was still 21 yuan, and the southern part of Shanghai was 20 yuan. However, the surface of the Zhashi market was still at 20 yuan as the highest, but in fact it was difficult to comply with the limit. The reason is that the price in the inland production area is similar to that in Shanghai, and the high-quality goods must be 20 yuan outside the pass. Therefore, the environment and the reality are not the control of outsiders. The intermediate and second-class japonica rice in Suzhou and Tongzhou have been revised by buyers, and the goods and customers are also following the market. The whole day was also lacking in transactions due to the rainy weather. Yang Du's various sharp and variable silver dollars were also silent. Moreover, because the indica rice was softened by the foreign rice, the market atmosphere was also very sluggish. Because the trading was quiet, there was no accurate market for the large plate, while the silver dollars in the southern part of Shanghai had a few customer gangs asking about it, and the price continued to be fixed.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Soars to Boiling Point</h3>
<p>The near term is approaching 6 Qian...The market retreated slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the frenzied atmosphere of the flour market in various months seemed to have reached its peak. The forecast of 2 taels and 6 qian in the current month has been almost the same. At the highest time, it was raised to 2 taels, 5 qian and 9 fen. The other months were also very active in buying. It is understandable that the current month is continuing to rise due to the squeeze. The long-term belongs to new flour, and wheat is still in the field. This kind of hard raising that is also keeping pace is very incomprehensible. For example, the highest price in June is 2 taels, 4 qian and 1 and a half fen, 7 qian and a half fen in July, 3 qian and 4 fen and a half in August, 3 qian and 6 fen and 2 and a half li in September, and 3 qian and 7 fen in October. With this price for new flour, I don’t know if there is a limit to the falling order. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the market showed a large rise and a small return due to the emergence of bulls. The difference from the highest price was more than 1 fen. Later, after observation, there was still a tendency to return to good again. As a result, the current month rose by 1 fen compared to the previous day, 7 qian and 8 fen rose by 2 and a half li, 9 qian rose by 7 and a half li, and October rose by 5 li.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat is Driven High by the Flour Market</h3>
<p>The highest record for opening new wheat</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of futures wheat rose across the board. It was found that most of this rise was driven by the flour market. Yesterday, it rained again, and the people's hearts outside the industry were naturally excited and bought as much as possible. Therefore, although foreign wheat was reported to be a small three or four jiao, it was not affected, and it continued to rise again and again, all opening the highest record for new wheat. Looking at the later steps, if the weather is not good, the people's hearts in the mainland will still continue to look forward to higher prices. As a result, June, July, August and October each rose by 3 fen compared to the previous day, and September rose by 4 fen. Although the price of current wheat is extremely accurate and is rising step by step, the factories are generally waiting and seeing and are unwilling to raise the price excessively. Therefore, there are very few transactions, and the price is only slightly better by 1 fen. The opening price of Xuzhou wheat, Nansu wheat and Qingjiangpu wheat was 5 taels and 1 qian and 6 fen, for a total of 700 bags.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Gradually Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, although there were still gangs asking about foreign rice, they were all in small numbers. There was no large-scale sales in various ports along the Yangtze River. However, the arrival and inventory were both strong. By the end of the month, there should be a total inventory of 400,000 to 500,000. Then the daily sales of 10,000 to 20,000 bags failed to support the market. Moreover, because the customer gangs in various places who purchased and stored wanted to close out and return, the market price had to be reduced slightly. Yesterday, the overall price returned to a small jiao. It is estimated that 3,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon were priced at 15 yuan and 4 jiao, followed by 15 yuan and 1 jiao, 2,000 bags of Mindang were priced at 14 yuan and 6 jiao to 14 yuan and 4 jiao, 400 bags of Dajiao were priced at 14 yuan and 2 and a half jiao, 6,000 bags of Xiaojiao were priced at 14 yuan and 4 jiao to 14 yuan and 1 jiao, and 500 bags of Xiaojiao coarse rice were priced at 13 yuan and 1 and a half jiao.</p>
<p>Pitou, Eastern Pitou and Han Gang Purchase Suddenly殷</p>
<p>Pitou transactions, yesterday the sales of eastern goods were smooth, and the Han gangs purchased very fiercely. More than 100 pieces of Shuangyi Deer Yuan Zhigong Ne were traded, causing the price to rise from 2 qian, 3 fen and 2 and a half li to 7 li. The lower-grade fine serge also had smooth sales, Baizitu 2 qian 3 fen, Huxinting 2 qian 3 fen and 7 and a half li, all belonged to the nature of collapsed goods. Yesterday, white crepe cloth was purchased on this street, the silver plate was 3 taels and 5 qian, Jiao Ye inscription slips were 3 taels and 7 and a half fen, Ace Dog was 2 taels, 9 qian and 7 and a half fen, and more than 50 pieces were sold. Blue striped satin softened again due to the abundance of inventory. Zijinshan 1 qian 6 fen 2 and a half li, deducting commission four scholars 1 qian 5 fen 7 and a half li are still lacking in demand. Printed Zhigong Ne has gradually risen recently. Bald big red has 2 qian and 9 fen, bald Yuan color has 2 qian, 8 fen and 7 and a half li, and various colors also need 2 qian and 8 fen, which is about 5 li higher than before. Western goods, yesterday, due to the rain all day long, the local customers' sales were quiet. Some bleached cloth from Hanzhen and other gangs was handled. Heji Yangtong Guan Bao was 10 taels, Gongping Shanghai famous prostitute was 9 taels and 3 and a half qian, and Taihe Red Chicken was 11 taels.</p>
<p>The Sugar Market, Coarse Sand and White Market Suddenly Turned Frustrated</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market production area telegraph, the current price of Cuban sugar was 1.4375, which was 0.0625 lower than the previous telegraph. The price of New York futures sugar was 1.38 in May, 1.54 in September, 1.64 in December, and 1.72 in March next year, which was 4 points lower than before. Only December fell by 3 points. The current price of Java sugar was 9.625, and the futures price of sugar in June and July was 9.50, which remained unchanged compared to before. After the sudden rise of the association's coarse sand and white sugar the day before yesterday, the buying atmosphere in yesterday's market turned quiet, because the sales were sluggish, and it was heard that the arrival of goods would be surging, and the market was suddenly frustrated. The transaction price was 7 taels and 5 fen, and the demand was still rare. The market image was also weak. The transaction of No. 20 medium sand and white sugar at 6 taels and 9 and a half qian was also rare. N-mark of Japanese sugar was 7 taels, 5 qian and 7 and a half fen, YT-mark was 7 taels, 5 qian and 3 and a half li, YP-mark was 7 taels, 7 qian and 2 and a half fen, YRO-mark was 7 taels and 2 and a half qian, and J-mark was 8 taels, 1 qian and 2 and a half fen. Although the transactions were scattered, the market image was quite stable.</p>
<p>Hardware, Sesame Nails Rise by Two or Three Taels</p>
<p>Sesame nails from 3 fen to 6 fen, because the cost is high, the dealers who sell them all need to lose two or three taels. Now the exchange rate has shrunk sharply, and the cost has greatly increased. All the dealers are complaining endlessly. Yesterday, after the association discussed, it approved an increase of two or three taels per box to maintain it. For example, 3 fen is sold for 21 taels and 5 qian, 4 fen for 20 taels, 5 fen for 20 taels and 2 qian and a half, and 6 fen for 19 taels and 5 qian. The transaction is still strong. However, most of the reported quotations are based on friendship, so each box is reduced by 5 qian less than the negotiated price. It is heard that the buyers are all gangs from the Yangtze River.</p>

<h3>The Chinese Public School Principal Issue</h3>
<p>The news of Hu Shih's resignation as president of the Chinese Public School has been reported in the newspapers for some time, but it has never been approved by the board of directors. It has been shelved for more than four months. Recently, President Hu submitted two major reasons to the board of directors for his resignation: (1) to complete his ten years of writing; (2) to accept an invitation to lecture at Yale University in the United States. Therefore, he had to leave the Chinese Public School. The following is the announcement of the board of directors allowing President Hu to resign, for public viewing, and to clarify the process of President Hu's resignation.</p>
<p>Since the end of April of the 17th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1928], we handed over the Chinese Public School to President Hu. In the two years since then, the Chinese Public School has made great progress in terms of both the number of students and their thinking. Everyone acknowledges that the current Chinese Public School is one of the better universities in China. We admire President Hu's efforts in the past two years and hope that in the future, the Chinese Public School will continue to develop into a world-renowned university because of President Hu's efforts. However, we know that President Hu has a greater career than managing a world-renowned university, and those great works that have been anticipated for ten years both at home and abroad need him to write them. Therefore, although we have repeatedly tried to keep him, we must also allow him to find a successor.</p>
<p>At the fourth meeting of the board of directors on January 12th of this year, President Hu resigned and recommended Mr. Ma Junwu as his successor. Mr. Ma is the founder of the Chinese Public School, the chief instructor of the Chinese Public School twenty-three years ago, a renowned scientist for twenty years, a senior figure in the education field, and a leader of the Chinese ideological revolution. President Hu wants to hand over the Chinese Public School to him so that he can concentrate on writing those great works, and wants him to guarantee the full development of the Chinese Public School after Mr. Hu leaves. Therefore, we believe that "Hu must leave, Ma must come; if Ma does not come, Hu is not allowed to leave." Later, Ma did not come, so we could not but strongly retain President Hu.</p>
<p>"On March 12th," President Hu "began writing the History of Medieval Philosophy." By May 3rd, "he had written 100,000 words in fifty days," and he said, "the book can be completed in two volumes in three or four months." Seeing the "100,000 words written in fifty days" and hearing his plan to "complete two volumes in three or four months," we had to quickly resolve the issue of the president of the Chinese Public School, which could interrupt his plan to write a great work of 200,000 to 300,000 words, so that he could concentrate on finishing this world-renowned work and other works that people at home and abroad have been anticipating for ten years before he "goes to the United States to lecture next January." Therefore, at the temporary meeting of the board of directors on May 5th, we helped President Hu persuade Mr. Ma to agree to succeed him. Therefore, we approved President Hu's resignation letter of May 3rd and appointed Mr. Ma Junwu as president.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Republic of China Year 19, May</p>
<p>We are very grateful to Mr. Ma for attending the meeting despite his illness and accepting our recommendation at the meeting. We firmly believe that the Chinese Public School in the hands of President Ma will be able to fully develop, just as it was in the hands of President Hu, and develop from a better university in China to a world-renowned university. President Hu has agreed to hold the inauguration ceremony for President Ma at 11:00 a.m. on Monday, the 19th of this month, in the auditorium of the Wusong Chinese Public School. At that time, I will represent the board of directors to welcome President Ma and thank President Hu. Cai Yuanpei, Acting Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Chinese Public School</p>
<h3>Four-Day Travelogue · Ye · Ren · Pu</h3>
<p>Shanghai Jiaotong University, since being under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Railways last summer, established a Department of Civil Engineering due to the shortage of civil engineering talents during the construction period, and hired several Western professors to teach this department. This shows that it is valued by the Ministry of Railways. Now, in order to conduct on-site inspections of geology, materials, and architecture, the entire third-year class of the Department of Civil Engineering, led by a Western professor from the university, went to Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Longtan, Wuxi, and Suzhou on the morning of the 9th for inspections, for a four-day trip. The situation along the way is recorded below. Life in the train</p>
<p>On this day, the Ministry of Railways prepared a first and second-class special train. When the students arrived at the station, they were all overjoyed. After the train started, some sang loudly, some chatted in groups of three or five, some played chess, and some practiced boxing. The Western professor also happily joined the chess group or learned Chinese. Teachers and students were together in one car, and the sound of laughter never stopped along the way. The loneliness of the journey disappeared without a trace.</p>
<h3>Longtan</h3>
<p>Arriving at Longtan at 2:00 p.m., they got off the train and went to visit the Taishan Cement Factory. The temperature reached 80 degrees on this day, and the scorching sun was overhead. Everyone was sweating profusely, their faces flushed. After arriving at the factory and resting for a while, Mr. Chen from the factory led them to explain in detail that the factory was close to Xiangshan, so all raw materials were supplied by this mountain. The scale of the factory is large and can be ranked among the best in China. After the tour, the factory's staff basketball team invited them to play a friendly match. The university declined but could not refuse. At first, the two sides were evenly matched, but later Jiaotong University lacked coordination, so despite having a cheerleading squad, they eventually lost by a score of 4 to 10. After the game, the factory prepared six tables of Chinese banquets to entertain the guests. The two Westerners had been in China for less than a year and were not very familiar with using chopsticks, so when a dish was placed in front of them, they quickly swallowed it and then analyzed it with their fingers, which was quite amusing.</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>Arriving in Nanjing at 10:00 p.m., they set off the next morning to visit. More than ten horse-drawn carriages were connected and moved in a grand manner, like a group of mourners. They first passed through Xuanwu Lake. The flowerbeds along the lake were all built with city bricks. The city bricks were from the Ming Dynasty and were still as solid as ever after many years. The two Westerners praised them endlessly. Leaving Chaoyang, they passed through the Ming Imperial Palace, but saw only desolation, with tiles and rubble everywhere. Seeing this, they could not help but feel sad. From a distance, the Zhongshan Mausoleum and the Ming Mausoleum were connected, standing tall and majestic. Ascending to the top, they looked around and saw all things in the universe. The Zhongshan Memorial Hall is majestic and grand, enough to make future generations who look up to it imagine the Prime Minister's dignity and stand in awe. The scale of the architectural project is also of great research interest. Returning through Yuhuatai, they lingered for a moment and arrived at the Ministry of Railways, where they viewed the newly built buildings and active telephones.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang, Wuxi</h3>
<p>Arriving in Zhenjiang on the 11th, they went to visit the tunnel. The tunnel is about a thousand feet long, with an air ventilation pipe in the center. The tunnel was completed in 1908 and has been around for more than twenty years. Arriving in Wuxi at noon, they bought a boat and first went to Liyuan Garden. The garden is next to Wuli Lake, with the water shimmering like a mirror. The weeping willows on the shore danced with the wind. The winding corridors were like earthworms, and the strange stones were arranged like birds and beasts. The bright windows and clean tables were extremely beautiful and serene. Next, they went to Yuantouzhu, a small mountain that protruded like a turtle's head, hence the name. The mountain is not high, but the scenery is beautiful, with lush greenery and pine and cypress trees. Climbing up the steps and looking around, they felt comfortable. To the south, there is a vast expanse of water and winding islands, which is Taihu Lake. There are several temples on the top, and the sound of bells and drums can be heard from time to time, which is quite leisurely. Later, they went to Meiyuan Garden, but it was too late, and the flowers, trees, pavilions, and terraces in the garden could not be distinguished. They could only feel the fragrance permeating the air.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Arriving in Suzhou on the morning of the 12th, they immediately took a boat to Tianping Mountain. They entered the Baimeng Spring, sipped tea, and chatted, washing away the dust and turbidity. From there, they went to One-Line Sky, then to Middle White Cloud, and then to Upper White Cloud. The shapes of the strange rocks, whether standing or lying, were like a lion roaring, or like an elephant pulling its nose. From the top, they looked down and saw green fields and embroidered dikes, and Taihu Lake with 36,000 hectares and the 72 peaks of Dongting were faintly visible in the misty water. It was truly a wonderful sight. Crossing the mountain, they encountered quarrymen, who relied only on manual labor and explosives for excavation, which shows the immaturity of our country's machinery. They started their journey back to Shanghai at 10:00 p.m. Everyone was tired and sleepy in the car, as if they were in a sleeping car. They arrived at the school at 1:00 a.m.</p>

<p>The Story of World Literature (1) (5) (7) by John Macy, translated by Hu Zhongte</p>
<h3>Chapter 40: The Classical Age of German Literature</h3>
<p>When the first figures of the classical age, Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock and Christoph Martin Wieland, appeared, the state of the literary world was as described above. In a sense, these two represented the two tendencies mentioned above, namely the Miltonic and the French styles. However, both went even deeper. Klopstock's hexameter epic "The Messiah," although unreadable today, its force and grammatical spirit did indeed convince the Germans, who were isolated from European literature by war and famine, that their country's language was a medium easily comparable to other great literary languages. Moreover, Klopstock's "Odes" often had something beyond mere taste and eloquence. In its highest points, the odes had imagination and sharpness, and can still be counted among the best of the more formal lyrics of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Wieland was the opposite of the serious "poet-like" Klopstock in every respect. He was French in temperament, but as much as his era allowed, he went behind the French and towards the Greeks. He went to the great Italians, Ariosto and Tasso. He also went to Shakespeare and made some of the earliest German translations of his plays. His flexibility, ease, clarity, and fluency were an immeasurable benefit to the readers and authors of his own country, and his philosophical romance "Agathon" and the romantic epic poem "Oberon" written in Ariosto's "octave rhyme" are still readable.</p>
<p>Before we talk about the masters, there is one more precursor to mention. This precursor is Johann Gottfried Herder. He was not a poet, nor did he write any memorable works, but only published some anthologies and critical fragments. However, he was one of the germinating spirits who cultivated the entire literary era. His studies of Shakespeare and Ossian, and his fundamental critical questions were fruitful. The most significant thing is that he discovered the supreme value of the folk poetry of all countries. His "Voices of the Nations in Song" broke the dominance of artificial classical Renaissance culture and opened the way for the development of folk songs, ballads, and folk songs. These, in later generations, became the source from which the entire Romantic movement and the Romantic studies of comparative linguistics, comparative mythology, and folklore originated.</p>

<p>Ford Motor Company</p>
<h3>Exerting Great Influence in Europe</h3>
<p>Extensive Investment in Various European Countries</p>
<p>It is well known that Ford cars are sold worldwide. Their installment payment sales method is also quite famous. The purchasing power of the European market has been progressing greatly recently. Specialized installment payment finance companies (Commercial Investment Trust Company and Commercial Trust Company) are achieving special results in their European operations. General Motors Acceptance Corporation is very active. Ford's Universal Credit Company is also striving forward, active in this new business. Ford owns 60% of the shares in the various companies currently operating in Europe. The rest belongs to the people of those countries. This plan is progressing very smoothly. The organization of the following companies is in progress, which shows a glimpse.</p>
<p>Hague news on March 9th: A Dutch company was organized, named N.V. Ford Motor Company, with a capital of 5,000,000 florins (approximately 2,000,000 gold dollars). It is planned to manufacture vehicles in Rotterdam. Ford Motor Company A.C. of Germany increased its capital on March 15th from 5,000,000 marks to 12,000,000 marks. The German pigment trust Farbwerke Hoechst acquired most of the shares. Carl Bosch, the chairman of the pigment trust, was elected as one of the directors. At the same time, Edsel Ford was elected as a director of the American branch of the pigment trust. Belgian Ford Motor Company S.A. offered 108%. This is the news from March 17th. The capital is 80,000 shares, with a face value of francs. However, because the bank sold the shares in the United States and Europe, this move was greatly opposed to the Ford authorities' opinion. Therefore, it is currently suspended. The price paid by those who purchased the shares outside Belgium must be returned before proceeding. On April 6th, the French Ford Company S.A. announced that the capital was 500,000 shares, with a face value of 100 francs per share. On May 17th, the Danish Ford Company S.A. was established, with a total capital of 12,000,000 kroner. 40% was sold to the public. Three-quarters of which were reserved for the employees and workers of the local company. According to the Polish Ford Company, its capital is approximately 10,000,000 yuan. The import tax on various parts of the motorcycle will also be reduced. It is estimated that 2,550 cars will be produced each month. And in countries other than Poland, such as Latvia, Romania, and Estonia. However, the negotiation to build a Ford assembly plant in August is still under discussion. And Romania may not allow Poland to sell its cars to their country. If it is so easy. Ford Motor Company is willing to lend money to the Romanian government to build roads if the government allows a piece of land in the free port of Constanta to build a car factory. This petition was approved by the Romanian government on September 13th. In addition to the previous plan to build another factory in Antitvaro, Yugoslavia, its car products are all sold in the Balkan Peninsula. Ford also has a new plan in Portugal. It is proposed that the government build a railway bridge across the Tagus River to build a commercial port in Montijo.</p>

<p>Republic of China Year 19, May 21st (Shen Bao</p>
<p>Plan. Suggesting that the government build a railway bridge across the Tagus River in order to build a commercial port in Montijo.</p>
<p>Since the Turkish government allowed Ford to have free trade within the scope of Constantinople, Ford Motor Company decided to move the factory in Trieste to Constantinople. Trieste in Italy will be used as a storage warehouse and as the central hub of southern Europe. In addition to assembling cars, the new factory in Constantinople will also install flying boats and heavy locomotives. According to the news from De Telegraaf in mid-June, the Constantinople factory will start construction at the end of the year. The number of cars produced each day is estimated to be 75. Ford Motor Company C.Y. of Helsinki, Finland, started investing on August 2nd. At that time, the capital increased from 20,000,000 to 28,000,000 Finnish marks. Also according to the Danish company's method, a part of the shares was purchased by employees. The capital of Ford Company of Iberia was collected from July 18th to 20th. The total capital is 30,000 shares, with a face value of 500 pesetas per share. 12,000 shares were sold to the public at 625 pesetas. This company manages the Ford business in Spain, Portugal, Gibraltar, Morocco, and Spanish and Portuguese territories. On May 16th, Edsel Ford held a groundbreaking ceremony in Dagenham, building a factory worth 25,000,000 yuan and employing 15,000 people. The factory is expected to be completed in two and a half years, producing 300 cars per day. In addition, parts for cars used in Paris and England will also be manufactured. The estimated annual output of the factory will reach 200,000. In addition, two more factories will be built near Germany and Paris to assist. The location of the new factory in Germany is set in Cologne, which is larger than the Berlin factory that assembled 1,200 cars in mid-August. The raw materials for manufacturing cars and parts will be mostly produced in Germany. The car parts produced are sent to Ford factories around the world for use. Currently, the Ford Motor Factory near Paris can produce 80 cars per day. This situation will be maintained until the new factory in France is established. Ford A cars sell very well in the European market. In the first three months, the first batch of 50,000 cars were sold. Near the end of June, Mr. Ford said that the factory can produce 500,000 cars per year abroad. In April, overseas sales were 16,995 cars. Sales in July during the summer were relatively low, with 15,701 cars sold. Henry Ford also paid great attention to old Russia. When the factory engineer Albert Kahn was planning a 1,000,000 yuan factory for the Soviet government in Nizhny Novgorod, Ford personally planned everything for Kahn on the phone, regarding the materials used in the plan and the working methods. He also said to Kahn, "The more industry, the better."</p>
<h3>Hudson Motors</h3>
<p>All-Steel Body Good People</p>
<p>The engineers and builders of Hudson Motor Car Company invented countless reforms. For the automobile industry, it is considered a standard practice. Hudson's sedans are priced below $1,000 in US dollars, which is truly the first. The invention of the steel body has improved the style. To this day, Hudson cars have all the features of other cars. The steel body is particularly safe. Not only is the engine power increased, but it is also stronger and more durable.</p>
<p>The steel frame of the new Hudson eight-cylinder sedan is no longer old-fashioned. The sections of the body are all fused together, so they can be permanently connected without damage. No noise. At the same time, the body is rigid and the power is increased.</p>
<p>The construction method of the car doors is also extremely elaborate. Ordinary car doors are wooden frames wrapped in iron sheets and covered with cotton. Hudson's car doors are made of five layers of materials. The outside is an outer layer of steel, inside is a soundproof mat, then a spring layer, and further in is an inner layer of steel. The inside is covered with cotton fabric.</p>

The scale is very large. The two gentlemen have extensive knowledge and experience. They have special insights into promoting cars.</p>
<p>Hudson Increases Capital The Hudson Motor Car Company of America has a considerable reputation for its cars. Recently, in view of the rapid progress of various automobile factories, in order to expand business and compete with other factories, the board of directors decided to increase capital by US$1,200,000 in common stock. A Famous American Car Enthusiast Returns Home Mr. M.E. Wallis was the former sales manager of the Oakland Motor Car Company. He has been engaged in the study of the automobile business for twelve years. He is shrewd, capable, knowledgeable, and experienced. He went to various European countries to investigate the automobile business and has now returned to the United States via Panama. The automobile industry welcomes him. Oakland Motor Car Company plans to hold a banquet to welcome him.</p>
<p>Peerless Sales Recent Situation Peerless Motor Car Corp is located in Cleveland, USA. They have been working hard to operate for many years and are progressing day by day. In the first two months, sales were extremely brisk, breaking previous records. The business is booming. The car is displayed in automobile exhibitions everywhere. From this, one can see a trend of development. A Famous Car Enthusiast Is Lost Again Mr. S.M Fagool, the chief instructor of the Reo Motor Car Factory, is also the most famous pioneer in the American automobile industry. He is erudite and talented. He is particularly knowledgeable about automobiles. He is intelligent, capable, affable, and easy to approach. He gets along well with people in the automobile industry. Unfortunately, he died in Detroit on the 21st of last month. From then on, he passed away. The cornerstone of the American automobile industry is lost again. Everyone was deeply saddened by the news of his death. The cause was said to be excessive mental strain. He groaned in bed for nearly two months. He was 46 years old. He served in the automobile industry for more than ten years. He was initially an engineer in a not-very-well-known automobile factory in New York. He endured hardship and worked hard. After work, he diligently studied cars without weariness. Later, he assumed the post of Deputy Assistant of the Central Railway Company and strived for development. The company's business continued to grow day by day. It was all thanks to him. Later, he resigned due to insufficient mental strength and recuperated in San Francisco for more than a year. The owner of Reo Company repeatedly and firmly invited him, so he took the position of Chief Instructor in the company and worked diligently and painstakingly. The company's success today is also due to him. Therefore, when he was dying, the owner of Reo Company was by his side, crying bitterly. On the day of the funeral, no fewer than hundreds of people held the funeral rope for him. Among them were many people in the automobile industry.</p>
