<p>總理遺像</p>
<h3>總理遺囑</h3>
<p>余致力國民革命凡四十年其目的在求中國之自由平等積四十年之經騐深知欲達到此目的必須喚起民衆及聯合世界上以平等待我之民族共同奮鬥</p>
<p>現在革命尚未成功凡我同志務</p>
<p>須依照余所著建國方略建國大綱三民主義及第一次一全國代表大會宣言繼續努力以求貫澈最近主張開國民會議及廢除不平等條約尤須於最短期間促其實</p>
<p>現是所至囑</p>
<p>國慶論文</p>
<h3>中國在國際上應有之地位王正廷</h3>
<p>凡國家在國際上應有其相當之地位。而</p>
<p>此地位之獲得。則必賴乎一國之國信與</p>
<p>實力。此爲研究國際政治者所公認也。我國幅員若是廣。人口若是多。而文化又若是其悠久。宜其爲世界上一等强國矣。然按諸實際。則相去甚遠。此受不平等條約之束縛。實爲其主因耳。總理知其然也。故特以廢除不平等條約詔示吾人。吾人受命亦旣數年於兹矣。然而收效未能如願實現者。其故何哉。蓋條約者雙方實力之結晶也。吾國今日之實力旣尚未足與列强並駕齊驅。而國内反動頻起。又不能即示友邦以統一鞏固之事實。則進行廢約。諸多困難。亦在臆中。然吾人却不敢以此自餒。故二年以來。關稅旣完全自主。收回法權租界與租借地等。亦正在進行以期逐步完成。惟今吾人所恃者。乃在信義。蓋自國民政府奠都南京。即宣告友邦願以合理合法手續廢除舊約。重訂新約。三年以來。政策一貫。即此一端。已足表示吾人在國際間遵王道重信義。而友邦間亦深明此意。故紛遣使節。蒞京呈遞國書。衣冠躋蹌。中外騰歡。迨此次討逆軍興。國家多事。而外之信任吾國民政府未嘗稍衰。可見吾國實力雖未充。而政府之信用則已大著矣。吾人若能本此精神。猛晋不已。一面完成統一。鞏固中央。則外崇國信。内增實力。而國際間應有地位</p>
<p>之取得。庶計日可待也。</p>
<h3>和平與統一何應欽</h3>
<p>辛刻革命經了若干先烈志士的流血犧牲。以及全國民衆受了莫大的痛苦和損失。然後能推翻滿淸的君主專制。建立中華民國的初基。如此辛苦艱難締造而成的雙十節。自然値得我們全國民衆年年歡忻鼓舞地來紀念他慶祝他。但是我們不要太忽略了。辛刻革命。僅僅算是掛上了一個民國的空招牌。並没有建設民國的實際。由推翻滿淸一點而論。固然算是成功。由全部革命的目的而論。究不能不謂爲失敗。革命的目的。不只在推翻滿淸。不只在獲得中華民國的虛名。而在造成一個三民主義自由平等的新中國。因此我們居今日而紀念國慶。不宜只徒歡忻鼓舞。稱頌太平。必須全國上下繼續努力。以求充實民國的内容。完成革命的全功。然後才不失紀念國慶的意義。</p>
<p>自民國成立至十三年北伐以前。完全是封建軍閥分爭割據的時期。同時也就是革命努力孕育長成的時期。北伐以後。乃是革命勢力與封建軍閥止式開始接戰的時期。現在已經是快到封建軍閥崩潰與滅亡的時期了。在前兩期全國民衆。都免避不了戰爭的痛苦和損失。戰爭的消弭。和平的實現。必須在封建軍閥奔潰滅亡之後。所以全國民衆。若里希望早一日解除戰爭的痛苦。應該努力促成封建軍閥的崩潰和滅亡。然後才可以達到自己的目的。</p>
<p>革命與反七命是　徂調和的。革命勢力的進展。常足以引起反革命勢力的聯和。後前一切投機取巧以革命爲利的反動份子。因爲革命内部力量的充實到了一定的程度無所再隠藏於革命旗織之工於　互相利用互相勾結。形成一種腐惡汚穢的大團結以爲最後的掙扎。所以革命的勢力越是向前進展。反革命的敵人。將越發顯露。越發增多。而革命的環境。將越發更加險惡。國民革命最大的數人。是帝國主義。是軍閥。是共產黨。這三種敵人。都利於中國的分崩離析。而不利于中國的統一。利于國民革命的失敗。而不利于國民革命的成功。當革命勢力單弱。不是明顯地妨害他們的利益時。似乎還可勉强數衍。一至他們已經覺得革命的勢力。和他們自己的昨益。將近發生衝突的時候。他們便用盡一切的手段。起而破壞革命。過去的事實。完全如此。以共產黨而論。本黨在十三年北伐之前。他們只是混迹在本黨之中。以爲活動。一至本黨勢力進展。到了武漢寗滬。將有統一中國之勢。於是不利本黨統一中國完全國民革命的共產黨。便着急異常。非千方百計破壞本黨分裂本黨不可。其</p>
<p>次帝國主義者。當國民政府偏安廣東一隅之際。認爲無甚妨害。反而時來周旋。可是革命軍到了長江。外國的軍輪。便紛紛調遣。如臨大敵。等到進過黃河。簡直會有人不顧一切。派兵來華。生生地造成濟南的慘案。至於軍閥的行動。更不待說。革命軍起攻取武漢。孫傳芳並不會感覺到有應援吳佩孚的必要。而北伐完成的今日。則利害極不相容的馮玉祥閻錫山。都可以甲圍成一塊。現在不單是軍閥與軍閥的聯合。而是軍閥共產黨帝國主義一切反動勢力的大聯合。我們看見中央軍討伐閻馮戰爭最烈的時候。共產黨拼命在湘鄂贛省殺人放火。攪亂後方。帝國主義者的報紙。拼命的音他造謡。帝國主義者的軍艦。公然保　反動份子　中央勢力所及的地方。來圖謀活動。總結說一句。軍閥共產黨帝國主義者。封於中國都懷抱着同一的希望。甚　希望　。　是胡展堂先生說。　的希望我們統二統三而不統一。尤其是不願意在中國國民黨領導之下。完成統一。因爲國民黨統一了。中國非實現三民主義不可。三民主義實現。則軍閥莫能倖存。帝國主義無從侵略。共產黨也就喪失其擾亂横行的機會。所以軍閥共產黨帝國主義者。相互間的利害。雖然不同。而破壞統一阻撓國民革命。却是他們共同的目標。因此遂造成此次反動大聯合的局面。以致反抗。中央　害地方兵連禍結而不可解。</p>
<p>國家的情形。到了現在。確是危險極了。帝國主義者不但觀望徘徊。不肯輕易允許廢除不平等條約。而且還竭力的帮助中國的内亂。以期保持其不正當取得的權利。共產黨燒殺擄掠。偏於東南。湘鄂贛的人民。十之八九。不能安居樂業。軍閥呢肆意造亂。罔惜民命。非到水盡山窮。野心不死。中央止亂無方。惟有戡亂。磊戰一起。戰區人民的痛苦爲何如。全國損失的重大又爲何如。本來陷於次殖民地的中國。　十年來受帝國主義者經濟的壓搾。生產落退。已屬莫可振拔。再加之以戰爭頻仍。便農失其畝。商閉其業。工乏容納之所。有智識有專門技能的人。尋不到適當的用途。　業激增。人心思亂。長此以往。勢不至國民經濟完全破產。民族生機完全祈絶不止。所以當此時期。不只是少數有識見的人會指導和</p>
<p>平。實富在全國的民衆。没有那一個不需要着和平。渴望着和平。不過我們要知道一科與統一。是有不可分解的關係。能統一自然會和平。離開了統一。則和平莫由實現。國民政府自來即</p>
<p>以和平統一爲政策。數年之中。對於桂系對於閻要恢復固有道德智能才能把中國民族從根救起來</p>
<p>要造成真正平等自由必須把世界文化迎頭赶上去</p>
<p>要人人犧牲自由然後國家得自由</p>
<p>要人人貢献能力然後國家有能力</p>
<p>中華民國十九年國慶日</p>
<p>戴傳賢敬書</p>
<p>馮等之野心暴露。無不盡情開導。委曲求全。然而李宗仁胡宗鐸。已經說明要對中央軍迎頭痛擊了。中央能夠聽其痛擊而不響應。閻錫山馮玉祥。已經稱兵動旅進攻徐州進攻南京了。難道中央政府也就聽其自然嗎。軍閥們私慾的發展。不是中央政府的寬大所能包容的。軍閥們執迷作惡的習性。不是中央政府感化所能收効的。容忍不可。感化不能。造亂者已經昌言不諱公然背叛中央進攻中央了。試問中央究竟應該任其横行殃民禍國而不顧嗎。還是應該整飭國家的紀網保障民族的生存。認爲責無帝貸而實行戡亂呢。戰爭至此。當然不能免避過去的事實。完全證明革命的中央。並不是蹟武窮兵。而是容忍不可免避不能。然後萬不得已忍痛討逆。討逆的目的。在戡亂在止亂。不是遠反和平而是要蘄求眞正</p>
<p>永久的和平。戰爭的原因。是由於軍閥的造亂。絶不是由於中央的戡亂。所以封建軍閥一日不去。則割據分裂謀亂禍國。所謂和平殆不可得而覩、要免避戰爭。必須認明造亂的軍閥。消滅造亂的原因。辛刻革命之所以失敗。就是因爲當時許多黨員。不十二分信仰總理。不按照總理的主義政策方略去實行。輕易把政權襄之於反革命的首領袁世凱。於是反革命的勢力潛滋暗長。終於破壞了革命勢力。形成無敵的軍閥。與起了國内十幾年來的内亂。欲安民衆而民衆之痛苦愈深。欲求和平而和平永不可得。此種失敗。給予我們最大的敎訓。我們今後應該知道永久的和平。必須於反革命勢力消亡中求之。若果只知有和平而不知有統一。不知要由統一以求實現三民主義。則一時妥協的局面。又下戰爭的種子了。革命的同志同胞們。我們所需要的是眞正的統一永久的和平。我們要完成國民革命建設三民主義的新中國。不宜畏鬆倫憤。暫求苟安一時。而忘却約　即至相延不止的戰禍。</p>
<p>我們要知道當十三年以前軍閥混戰的時間。所謂直皖之戰。是吳佩孚和段祺瑞在打仗。江浙之戰。是齊　元和盧永祥在打仗。所以有些人簡直稱爲直皖之感齊盧之戰。比較名副其實。這種直皖之戰。齊盧之戰。和現在的戰爭比較。基意義絶不相同。從前是私人的爭奪相殺。而現在是革命的中央。討伐叛逆的軍閥。換句話說。就是革命與反革命的戰爭。私人的爭奪。每每到了雙方精疲力竭的時候。只要有幾個和事老人出來調停一下。好在彼此都無所謂。便不妨言歸於好。而妥協的局面。遵告成立。至於革命與反革命的戰爭。絶無所謂妥協。只有三種結果。（一）革命的勢力敵不過封建勢力而遭受頓挫、（二）封建軍閥底滅亡。（三）封建軍閥的悔過輸誠。在第一種的時候。革命的勢力。雖然遭受頓挫。終必突飛猛進。以獲得最後的勝利。辛亥革命失敗的敎訓。便促成此次革命的進展。因此我們可以說革命只有勝利的。所謂失敗。也就是勝利的預備成功的先機。革命尚未成功。反革命勢力披猖爭地爭城。殺人不息。那有絲毫和平的曙光。所以軍閥割據。只有繼續不斷的戰爭。惟有一切軍閥。被革命的勢力所消滅。或悔悟而眞正投誠革命的時候。才有所謂和平。才能夠得到永久的和平。進一步說。革命與反革命的戰爭。旣不是個人的問題。則所謂軍閥的投誠。當然不是人對人的讓步屈服而已。最低限度。是要造亂的軍閥。悔罪以謝國人。並且在事實上要絶對抛棄其軍閥的行爲　所有軍閥公之於黨國。曰　於中央。假如没有這種感切的表示。眞不是眞正的覺悟。眞正的悔過。而是野心不死。　父不除。魯難未</p>
<p>己。軍閥猶在。和平安資。全國民衆。不可不注意啊。軍閥們最後投機。當其失敗之後。每每利用全國渴望和平的心理。以求倖在而保全實力。本來戰爭一久。自然有許多有力量有聲譽不忍民生疾苦的人。出來倡導和平。於是造亂者　此機會。好像一經提出和平的口曁。所有禍國殃民的罪惡。通通在不問不議之列。國聲附和。和平和平。不是民衆的福音。到變成了軍閥危愈時謹身的靈符。種種過去的事情。眞是滑稽而又令人嘆息。你們看造　失敗的閻馮。將來力會主張和平的。我們懲前毖後。惟有擁護中央和平統一的政策。擁護張副司令尊重統一聽候中央送置的主張。我們固然　要和平。但是我們要審愼考慮。究竟這種和平。是否是可靠。是不是和平之後。還伏有莫大的危機。我們不能盲目地承　。凡是和平都是好的。我們時時刻刻不忘和平。但是我們同時尤其不要忘了統一。不要忘了爲實現三民主義而有必要性的統一。</p>
<p>統一不是某人服從某人。不是乙省服從甲省。詎不是北方服從南方。或者是南方服從北方。而是各省各地的軍政民政財政……一切要聽命中央。要遵行中央政府的法令。整個的國家。不容任何人使之分裂。國家的軍隊土地財力。不容任何人據爲己有。我們相信全國民衆。没有一個是以統一爲不利不願意統一的。即以閻馮宰割下的山陜而論。試問山西人陜西人。不是中國人嗎。難道他們只求山西好陜西好而不望中國好嗎。稍爲有點智識的山西人陜西人。難道不明白。若遼寗東北大學敎育學院參觀團採用上海三友實業社新出品「二一二」軟自由呢服裝攝影，第一排中会者係該校謝享藩敎授，其右穿「二一二」學生裝者，係商務交際博士黃警頑先生，　　三友社自紡自染自織之「二一二」軟自由呢，質地柔軟堅緻，文雅顔然已出五十餘種，爲舶來品呢羢嗶嘰之國貨代替品，做男女中西式服裝，莫不優美，國貨運動週内大减價七天，南市蓬萊市塲門市部亦同時舉行　　▲今日雙十國慶紀念本公司休業一天</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>果中國滅亡。山西陜西斷無單獨倖存之理嗎。同是中國人當然希望有一個統一的國家。但是閻馮軍閥。偏想利用國民智發的欠缺。分出南北的界限。造出種種無謂　言。他們以爲中央軍討伐叛逆。是南方征服北方。希圖藉地域的保傽。苟延其軍閥生活的殘喘。殊不知中央是全國的中央。絶不是那一方的中央。中央所要討伐的。只是閻馮軍閥。絶不施於那一省那一方的民衆。此種意義。非常顯明。北方的民衆。又何嘗肯甘受其愚呢。</p>
<p>我們可以說和平是革命成功的結果。而不是革命必取的手段。統一並不是革命的成功。而只是革命必經的過程。因此我們更可以明白了。必須先有統一　後有和平。和平不是離開統一的意義。可以實現的。離開統一而談和平。就是苟安。是妥協。是不革命。是予軍閥以培養的機會。是爲大亂種無窮的惡因。全國民衆啊。你們最歡迎的是和平。然而你們最要當心的也就是和平。我們旣然認淸中國的義環境。非實行三民主義不足以挽救危亡。非在中國國民黨領導之下。不足以實現三民主義。而且　定要挽救國家的危亡。要實行三民主義。非先促成國家的統一不可。所以現在我們全國同胞。惟一的出路。就是要革命。要擁護革命的中央。消滅叛亂的軍閥。完成國家的統一。我們當着這十九年的雙十節。回譽起辛亥革命以若干民衆的痛苦。若干志士的頭顱。換來的成績。曾經誤於和平妥協。輕輕易易就皆送了。自十三年北伐以來。又不知有若干同志的犧牲。幾多民衆的流　。而後能有今日的局面。當此殘餘軍閥最後崩潰的時候。我們萬不可再蹈辛亥革命的覆轍。使數年重大的犧牲。又化爲烏有。我們酷愛和平。我們惟有全國一致剗除破壞和平的軍閥。不宜聽破壞和平的軍閥投機取巧而不負責任。然後革命可以早日成功。國家的前途。纔有良好的希望啊。</p>

<p>自總理首倡革命。經二十餘年之奔走。十餘次之失敗。始有辛亥武昌之起義。達到推翻帝制創立民國之目的。顧民國建立以後。淸廷之遣臣。以及新興之軍閥政客。接踵而起。相尋竊國。自是内戰綿延。迄無寗歲。而國運杌隉。民生凋敝。以視淸末殆有過之。總理以革命之目的未達。乃團結同志。繼續奮鬥。用圖肅淸反動餘孽。建立眞正民主之國家。於是再經十餘載之努力。始有民國十七年之北伐成功。統一中國。不幸總理已先去世。未及親見其盛况。然其在天之靈。當可稍慰矣。當此之時。吾黨同志。方額手稱慶。而全國人民。亦莫不歡忭鼓舞。延頸企踵。共冀軍事之告終。訓政之開始。誰意兩年之間。反側軍人。叛黨份子。變起肘腋。禍生不測。中央爲削平叛逆計。不能不復用干戈。際此次閻馮張桂聯合稱兵。反動勢力。遂達登峯造檯之境。幸中央剿撫多方。將士用命。歷數月之征誅。反動勢力之聯合陣綫。先後崩潰。今東北出師。收復平津。晋豫殘敵之收拾。易如反掌。吾人於國慶佳期。重覩和平。良足慶幸。然語有云『前事不忘。後事之師。』凡我國民。痛定思痛。不能不有澈底之覺悟焉。間嘗考之。中國之所以不能於辛亥一役。建設鞏固之民治政府。實行三民主義者。雖因軍閥之專横。政客之搗亂。而其實則軍閥之所以能專横。政客之所以能搗亂。乃由於民治基礎之薄弱。社會環境之惡化。有以致之是故。欲求中國内亂之永戢。三民主義之實現。必須確立民治之基礎。樹建民治之精神。然後反動餘孽無從寄生。革命障礙。始能掃除。否則梟雄狡獪之輩。鬼蜮萬端玄虛百出。捲土重來。固意中事也。當此一陽復始。百廢待興之日。吾人必須足踏實地。以堅忍卓絶之精神。百折不撓之毅力。樹立新中國之民治基礎。此基礎爲何。一曰心理基礎。二曰物質基礎。三曰政治基礎。三者旣備。而後國民革命之目的。乃能實現。三民主義之成功。可立而待矣。</p>
<p>何謂心理基礎　心理基礎者謂全國國民。應一致受三民主義之洗禮。務使全國國民。不但了解三民主義之涵義。且能誠信三民主義爲惟一之救國方策。同時並有實行三民主義之决心也。欲達此種目的。必須確定三民主義爲全國敎育之中心標的。並以十分誠意。勉力於此種方案之實施然後全國靑年之思想。乃不致誤入歧途陷於徘徊紛擾之狀態。迨全國靑年之信仰。旣已堅定。在消極方面。則外來之煽惑。不易動摇。而在積極方面。則由信仰即能發生雄厚之能力。此種能力。蓋即推進主義之原動力也。自吾黨統一中國以來。在名義上。亦曾注意及此。惜實際上所生效果。至屬輕微。靑年之思想。龐雜凌亂。不减疇昔。長此以往。危機之大。莫此爲甚。此爲目前所當策羣力以赴之者一也。</p>
<p>其次爲物質基礎之建設。中國爲產業落後之國家　國計民生。上下交困。加以天災人禍。人民之流離失所者不可以數計。此輩於饑寒交迫之際。不流於匪盜。便投入行伍。職是之故。軍匪之增加。遂成正比例。邇來共黨潛伏。到處煽動。聚嘯游民。蔓延各省。實爲中國心腹之患。然肅淸之計。專賴武力之誅剿。殊難根本消滅。最良方法。厥爲民生問題之解决。故吾人必須於最短期間。依照總理之實業計畫。開發農鑛工商各項實業。然實業之開發。首在交通之利便。故鐵道公路。又爲開發實業最重要之工具。以中國幅員之廣。人口之繁。全國鐵道。僅得七千英里。平均每二百七十六英方里。或五萬五千人口。始有一英里之鐵道。較之任何國家。其比例均爲最小。又何怪寳藏之不能興。國民經濟之窮困乎。是故總理十萬英里之鐵道計劃。必須促其寳現。然後農礦工商各業。乃能以次發展。人民之衣食住行四大要素。乃能有圓滿之解决。管子云。「衣食足。而後禮義興。」生活安定。雖欲驅人民爲盜。亦不可得矣。豈復有挺而走險者乎。此爲目前所當策羣力以赴之者二也。</p>
<p>復次爲政治基礎之確立。政治者。乃爲人民而設。非人民爲政治而有也。政治之目的。在謀全國人民共同之福利。然以往之軍閥政府。不獨在積極方面。不能爲人民興利除害。而在消極方面。亦不能保障社會之安寗。適足以增加人民之担負與痛苦而已。吾黨之實行國民革命。其目的在求政治爲民所有。爲民所治。爲民所享。當此訓政時期。必須剷除一切吏治之陋習。蠲免一切苛捐雜稅。同時對於人民之四權。務期早日實施。使全國耳目。爲之一新。然後全國國民。始能感覺國民政府之所以異於軍閥時代之眞意義。同時對於本黨之主義政綱。獲得深切著明之認識。苟吾人不能於預定訓政時期内。完成訓政工作則人民心目中。將不免謂三民主義。不過爲不兌現之鈔票而已。吾人又將何以自解乎。此爲吾人目前所當策羣力以赴之者三也。</p>
<p>以上三者實爲民治之基礎。亦即實現三民主義之基本條件。此三種基礎之建設。雖未能一蹴而幾。然苟能以總理百折不撓之堅忍精神。剷除一切虛僞之惡劣根性。則其道固不在遠也。此則視吾黨同志有無决心與誠意而已耳。今當閻馮張桂。先後肅淸。全國復歸一統之期。全國人民。對於吾黨俱懷無窮之期望。願吾黨同志。急起直追。以慰喁喁之情焉。</p>

<p>民國十九年國慶日寄</p>
<p>申報社　戴傳賢書祝</p>
<p>鋒陷陣。决勝負於疆塲。此有形的戰爭。呌做兵戰。或持籌握算。决勝負於市塲。此無形的戰爭。呌做商戰。兵戰和商戰的手段不同。但目的則一。無非爲權利。古代戰爭以兵戰。戰勝了。土地任佔據。子女玉帛惟所欲。可是殺人盈野。流血成河。情形未免太慘酷。現代戰爭以商戰。以「貿易政策」貧他人之國。弱他國之民。結果。佔據其土地。奴隸其人民。無兵戰的名。有兵戰的實。還有兵戰是一時的武力。不可久恃。失敗的人。也是一時屈服。伺機而動。有仇必報。後患不堪設想。商戰的方法。巧妙得多了。第一、是吸收金錢。没有了金錢。任何事也做不來。第二、如英國以「鴉片」當做商品。販賣到中國來。引誘中國人吸「鴉片」。馴至種族衰</p>
<p>弱。全失抵抗的力量。要是一朝亡了國。</p>
<p>便永遠没有復國的可能。所以商戰的禍害。比兵戰更加厲害。</p>
<p>商和農工礦的比較</p>
<p>一國的生產事業。農業、工業、礦業外。還有商業。商業爲什麽算是生產事業呢。因爲生產的原素。不外效用的增加。不一定要創造材料。工人製造。也不過改變物的形體。商人以販賣貨物。引起貨物的效用。其重要不下於工。更不下於農和　。兹比較如左。</p>
<p>（一）商業和農業的比較　農產原料。但販運原料。非商人不可。否則。一方面農產過剩。農民無從得代價以維持生活。一方面工料不足。工人無從製器物以供衆用。社會的恐慌立見。所以商業的重要。不下於農業。</p>
<p>（二）商業和工業的比較　工主製造。製</p>
<p>造的目的。則爲銷售。銷路越大。製造越多。工業然後發達。銷路不好。製品過剩。工業欲不衰敗烏可得。所以商業的重要。不下於工業。</p>
<p>（三）商業和礦業的比較　開礦的目的有二。主觀的目的爲營利。客觀的目的爲供給民用。倘没有商人爲他直接或間接的販賣。兩目的都不可達。所以商業的重要。不下於礦業。</p>
<p>更舉例爲證</p>
<p>一、英國是世界第一商業國。因爲英國人善經商。英國的國旗。跟着英商的勢力。遍樹於海外。所以英國就成了世界第一</p>
<p>大國。</p>
<p>二、德國是世界第一工業國。他的製造品</p>
<p>。雖然素以精良見稱。但要是没有商人向海外推銷。則因本國需要量不多。工業範圍必縮小。所以德國現在工業有這樣的發達。還當歸功於商人。</p>
<p>三、美國是世界第一農業國。因爲美國商人的努力。歐亞各國。都做了美國貨的大主顧。美國得此好機會。生產就不患過剩。儘量的擴張、推廣。就成了世界第一富國。</p>
<p>四、以中國來講。中國礦產的豐富。早爲世界所公認。但因商業不發達。礦業就無從振興。</p>
<p>講到中國。不僅有豐富的礦產。就工業和農業來說。中國工業的發生。本來很早。又素以農業立國。只因歷代的帝王不重商。不知道商業實爲工、農、礦業的靈魂。以致到了現在。讓他的商業佔了上風。華商在重重壓迫之下。竟無由自拔。連帶工、農、礦業。統統趕不上他國·「一着之失。滿盤都輸。」中國人「輕商」的心理。現在該完全覺悟了吧。</p>
<p>中國商業失敗原因</p>
<p>（一）金融上失敗的原因　一國的金融活動與否。和商業發展大有關係。孫中山先生說。「中國人大家都是貧。……中國的頂大資本家。和外國資本家比較。不過是一個小貧。其他的窮人。都可說大貧。」——民生主義第二講——以中國人的貧。去和外國貿易。大資本壓迫小資本。商業的失敗無疑。但何以證明中國人貧昵。可把各國的富力平均起來。美國每人有六六○七元。英國每人有五二四七元。法國每人有二五四九元。日本每人有一七二一元。德國每人有一一四一元。意國每人有一一一七元。俄國每人有七五六元。中國每人只有一○一元。</p>
<p>（二）工業上失敗的原因　中國有機製工廠。還在淸光緒時代。但因爲一。中國無大資本家。二·中國人不善利用共資。）——公司組織。所以工業的進步。實迂緩異常。到現在。仍没有成效可言。單講棉業棉業的生產能力。以錠數計算。每錠和人口的比率。英國爲○·七。美國爲一·五。捷克斯洛伐克爲三·九。法國爲四·一。德國爲六·三。意國爲八·一。日本爲一四·五。俄國爲一八·二。印度爲三七。中國爲一九七。工業程度之相去有如是。</p>
<p>（三）交通上失敗的原因　孫中山先生原有築鐵路十萬哩。碎石路一百萬哩。以開發中國的交通計劃。但現在鐵路。只成了約七千理。和各國比較起來。各國的鐵路和面積的比率。每鐵路一哩。英國爲五方哩。荷蘭爲六方哩。法國爲八方哩。美國爲十一方哩。日本爲二十五方哩。中國則多至二百二十方哩。再講航業。在中國境内。中國只佔了百分之十八。大洋航業。中國只佔了千分之四。程度相差更遠了。</p>
<p>（四）捐稅上失敗的原因國家種種。有二點不可不注意。一、要不病商。二、要不</p>
<p>擾民。中國釐金。本屬複稅。　釐局又辦理不善。需索留難。病商擾民。釐金以外。各地方政府。更巧立名目。繁賦苛捐。層出不窮。妨碍工商發展。影響國計民生。國民政府成立。廢除苛捐維稅的呼聲遍全國。最近。工商部有「廢除苛捐雜稅方　」的擬定。而裁釐之期。亦已不遠。若固能一一實行。中國的工商。庶幾有發展之望。</p>
<p>（五）幣制上失敗的原因　中國貨幣的紊亂。爲世界各國少有的現象。歷來的損害。不可以勝述。最近。金貴銀賤。中國爲「銀本位」國。外債利息的償付。外國貿易的付價。和外匯計算上種種的損失。爲數更鉅。財政部近來。也知有改革幣制的必要。但「金本位」的實行。還遥遥無期、實爲發展商業上的一大阻力。</p>
<p>除上述五種原因外。還有國内商人。有守成的思想。無發展的識見。政府對於商業。無充分的保護。無相當的設備。國際。更有不平等條約的束縛。和外商勢力的囂張。也都是我國商業失敗的重要原因。</p>
<p>發展中國商業計劃</p>
<p>一、對内的計劃。一捐稅當酌量减免。以輕生產的成本。商人的負担。二貨幣當積極整理。實現統一。以便利計算和授受。三交通當積極擴充。以便利商旅的往來。貨物的運輸。四工業當區别民營。國營。積極的各個發展。以内應國用。外供世界的需求。擴充商業於世界。五當設法開源。籌集大宗的資金。爲建設一切。發展一切之用。</p>
<p>二、對外的計劃。一當取消一切不平等條約。並收回外國在華一切勢力根據地。如租界租借地等。二中國當自國航路。自覓商塲於海外。三中國當在海外設立貿易機關。及諸輔助貿易機關。</p>
<p>發展商業可以救國</p>
<p>現在的中國。可算得貧了弱了。貧在什麽地方。因爲對外貿易。年年入超。本國金錢。年年流出。流出到現在。中國又安得不貧。弱在什麽地方。因爲全國人民。受了專制時代。「愚民政策」的遺毒。人民的心理。只重做官。不重經商。做官的人多腐化。苛稅病商。又禁止人民顧問國事。所謂「民可使由之。不可使和之」。馴至人民無力量衛國。國家無力量衛民。外侮來了。就拱手聽受支配。失利喪權。殃民辱國。已往種種失敗。可爲殷鑑。從今以後。如能努力發展商業。則第一、可挽回對外貿易入超的頽勢。以免金錢外溢。第二、對内可伸張商權。對外可發展國力。商權伸張。商蠧自消。國力發展。外侮不至。加以國貨輸出增加。自不難轉貧爲富。轉弱爲强了。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>從種種方面看起來。中國的商業。現在已有了生機。生機在那裏。就是國民革命的成功。孫中山先生主義的實行。商人階級的開放。商人得以固有的力量。連絡全國民衆。直接作救國運動。又因爲國民政府開始全國的建設。遵照「孫中山先生遺囑」。廢除不平等條約。自外人手中。收回了種種已失的特權。都足予各國商業以不利影響。予中國商業以發展機會。所以中國的商人。要加緊努力。發展中國的商業。消滅各國在華的一切勢力於「商業政策」之下。以完成「救國」的工作。</p>

<p>國慶論文二</p>
<h3>和平胡漢民</h3>
<p>「和平、奮門、救中國」</p>
<p>在國慶節重臨和軍事埀定的今日、我們回想總理這句最終的遺言、尤其覺得有嚴重深切的意義、</p>
<p>我們求得到中國眞實永久的和平、才能完成救中國的使命、救中國即是國民革命的目的、要達到這一個目的、便要靠奮鬥、</p>
<p>中國至今所以紛亂不治、所以不能得到眞實永久的和平、原因雖多、但事實上表現出來而使我們最容易認識的、一是帝國主義之壓迫侵擾於外、二是封建軍閥之割據作亂於内、這兩種反和平的勢力、交相爲禍、遂造成中國民族的國際地位不平等、政治地位不平等、經濟地位不</p>
<p>平等、</p>
<p>在這種外患内憂互相爲患所積累的情形之下、要爲中國求眞實永久和平、而完成救中國的使命、根本上便須對軍閥不妥協、對帝國主義不妥協、必須把這兩種和平的大障碍除去、才能爲中國民族求得國際地位的平等、政治地位的平等、和經濟地位的平等、掃除了軍閥、廢除了帝國主義所以縛束中國的不平等條約、纔是進了眞正永久和平的門户、做到了民族地位平等、政治地位平等、經濟地位平等、纔是登了眞正和平的堂奥、如果不然、軍閥未掃除、而想苟且敷衍與軍閥謀眞實永久的和平、不平等條約未取消、而想苟且敷衍向帝國主義謀眞實永久的和平、這都不僅是錯誤、簡直是妄想、我們應該知道、和平的基點、在打破和平的障碍、障碍不去、但謀苟且敷衍過去、這是苟安、不是和平、</p>
<p>這種道理、應該是又簡易又容易了解的、然而事實却每每不然、當我們今日正在努力對内掃蕩一切反動軍閥的殘餘勢力、對外收回一切主權、以期實施建設、使中國走上眞實永久和平大道的時候、一般人尤其是若干所謂智識份子、都渴望立刻和平、他們說、「立刻和平、是我們今日唯一的出路」、無論和平的代價如何重大、總要比爭戰便宜、這誠然是眞理、但唯其如此、所以就更不能不從眞實永久的和平的方面努力、而决不能爲一時的苟安着想、唯其消弭戰亂實現和平的心理、是我們之所同具、所以不能不深究和平的眞僞與久暫、像目前一般人所想望的立刻和平、究竟是眞實的、還是虛僞的、是永久的、還是暫時的呢、我敢堅决的說、假如我們不能根本剷除封建勢力的根株和帝國主義的特權、眞實永久的和平、是决不會降臨的、換言之、這不是和平之不可想望、而是和平之不可能也、總理在第一次全國代表大會宣言中、說得是最透澈的、他說</p>
<p>構成中國之戰禍、實爲互相角立之軍閥、此互相角立之軍閥、各顧其利益、矛盾至於極端、已無調和之可能、即使可能、亦不過各軍閥間之利益得以調和而已、於民衆之利益、固無與也、此僅軍閥之聯合、尚不得謂爲國家之統一也、民衆果何需此乎、至於知調和之不可能、而惟冀各派之勢力保持均衡、使不相衝突、以苟安一時者、則更爲夢想、何則伥董事實上不能禁軍閥中之派不對於他派而施以攻擊、且凡屬軍閥、莫不擁有軍隊、而其結果、不能不出於戰爭、出於掠奪、蓋掠奪於鄰省、較之掠奪於本省爲尤易也、</p>
<p>所以、不剷除軍閥而但求苟安、是不可能的、因爲互相角立之軍閥間、其利益至爲矛盾、連調和亦不可能、即使調和於一時、事實上亦不能禁各軍閥之不出於互相戰爭、互相掠奪、這便連苟安亦不可能、過去三年來的事實、正是證明總理這段道理是不可移易的、三年以來、中央所抱持的政策、便是實現和平、我們深知非和</p>
<p>平不能恢復社會的元氣、而予人民以休養生息的機會、非和平不能充實國家的力量、而推進革命的建設、所以我們就此主張編遣、以樹立國家的軍隊、改造軍人的心理、但是事實上因爲還是多少遷就了、一二未曾改變面目殘餘軍閥、遂使編遣之實施、横受阻碍、自李宗仁白崇禧以至於目前的閻錫山馮玉祥、都因爲不曾改變封建割據的心理、不肯接受編遣、並且妄動干戈、陰謀傾覆中央、各求個人野心的狡逞、由此我們可知在物理學上「同一時間與空間不能容有兩個不同的物體」的定律、移到革命的觀點上、便是同時同地不能容許反革命的力量與革命的力量並立、如果並立、則由相拒而至於相爭、至於破裂和平、這一個眞理、是絲毫不可移易的了、</p>
<p>由是可知我們所要求的、不是苟安的敷衍的和平、而是剔除一切和平障碍後所獲得的眞實永久的和平、中央在過去以至於月前、事實上一面討逆戡亂、一方謀建設、都是爲着這一個目標而努力、明白言之、正惟其有破壞和平稱兵作亂之叛變的軍隊、才去制裁反側、戡定内亂、這不是窮兵、更不是黷武、而是保障和平與實現和平所必要的手段、因爲假如一個負革命使命的中央、旣不能止亂或弭亂於先、又不能戡亂於後、以維護其所樹立所實施的政策、以求國家民族的自由平等、其結果必至任國家之分崩離忻、而陷民族於萬刦不復、此不特負革命使命的中央無以自解、抑且無以自存了、</p>
<p>總理在民國十三年的北上宣言中、曾明顯的說、「十三年來軍閥本身有新陳代謝、而其性質作用、則自袁世凱以至於曹錕、如出一辙、故北伐之目的、不僅在覆滅曹吳、尤在曹吳覆滅之後、永無同樣繼起之人、……蓋必如是、然後國民革命的目的、乃得以掃除障礙之故而活潑進行也、」這一段話、即足以證實我們上述的論點、曹吳覆滅之後、有與曹吳同樣繼起之人、在總理尚且以爲不可、則假如曹吳的本身復起、自然更不行了、而現在若干所謂智識份子、於目前等於曹吳的軍閥、覆滅即在目前的時候、不知道根本上從肅淸平和的障礙去着想、却希望着虛僞暫時的和平、這是何等的怪事、的確、如和平而可求、則以實現和平爲唯一的政策的中央、又何樂而不爲、但是這種和平、是趙孟偷食朝不及夕的和平、是不可能的和平、即使幸而求得、也是國民所不需要的、這些地方、我們同志同胞、都不能不精審地加以攷量、</p>
<p>以此推論到當前的情勢、我們應該認定、已經作亂的人、不能與之講和平、曾經煽亂的人、也不能與之講和平、作亂的人、因爲兵敗力屈、便一反往昔的態度、突然希求和平、可是他的目的、究竟何在呢、不用說、是在等他因作戰而喪失的力量、恢復到相當的程度時、再行作亂、假如我們與這等人謀和平、甚至許其和平、結果就是内亂循環不已、而人民所受的損失、一定更大、所受的痛苦、也一定更深、這是很明顯的、其次、曾經煽亂的人、何以也不能與之講和平呢、因爲凡是煽亂的人、一定是一班恥的官僚與政客、乃至如汪精衛等一切失節的黨人、這些人没有廉恥、没有節操、他們看到所賴以生存而作亂者、行將崩潰、早已心慌手亂、不</p>
<p>得不高唱虛僞的和平論調、度過目前的難關、再慢慢的求達一己的慾望、如果與這種人講和平、甚至爲他們所惑、許其和平、其禍害之大、更是不可以推測了、</p>
<p>我們的結論是、要眞實永久的和平、唯一正路、第一步、在於除去和平障礙、所謂障礙、就是殘餘的軍閥和帝國主義所未完全退回的特權、第二步、在於努力實現總理所定三民主義的實際建設、這兩個步驟要相輔而行、才是我們所要求的眞實永久的和平、也就是總理最後囑付我們「救中國」的唯一途徑、唯有建設三民主義、才有「和平」「救中國」的眞實内容、因爲唯有這主義、才能使民族地位平等、政治地位平等、經濟地位平等、我們要努力、求民族地位平等、所以就要廢除一切不平等條約、以獲得我們民族應有的獨立和自由、要努力求政治地位平等、所以就要剷除封建軍閥寡頭政治、而實行地方自治、以伸張人民的權力、要努力求經濟地位平等、所以就要開發交通、厘定生產組織、扶助社會各種實業發展、以蘇民困、這一切、都爲整個民族整國人民求眞實永久的和平、而不是與軍閥槿帝國主義求一時的苟安、簡單地說、全國人民有了生活、有了自治權能、有了民族向上發展的自由、則眞實永久的和平就在其中、如此就是「和平」「救中國」、我們要全國一致向這條大路去「奮鬥」、</p>

<p>何爲而有國慶記念。以推翻滿淸之腐舊政治。而成立民國也。何爲而推翻滿淸腐舊政治以成立民國爲欲合乎世界潮流。以爭存於世界也。故欲紀念國慶。必須時時明白世界之情狀。世界情狀時時變易。欲爭存於此世界者。故亦不可不時時推究而考求。世界之良法美政。採取而行之。世界之危機敝俗。預防以避之。去世界之不善以用其善。使中華民國成爲世界最善之國。此年年國慶時所當措意也。</p>
<p>夫國家無一不望其興盛而永久。中華民國之於世界。以物質與政治而言。原爲文化落後之國。然有時亦因落後之故。其弊害亦後於他人。是在國人於世界潮流之中。其取舍不能不加之意也。今當軍事結束。將上建設之途。故於國慶紀念日一言及之。</p>

<p>（一）總理倫敦蒙難是中國民族之生死關頭、總理在民族主義第三講中有言、「中國民族思想、完全没有了、在這幾百年中、中國的書裡頭、簡直看不出民族主義來、只看見對於滿洲的歌功頌德、甚麽深仁厚澤、甚麽食毛踐土、從没有人敢說滿洲是甚麽東西的……」由此數語、可以想見總理恢復中國民族思想之决心、與其反抗專制政治之精神、蓋自滿淸竊據中國以來、對於中華民族、横施壓迫、我中華民族慴伏於滿淸積威之下者、垂三百年、養成苟且偷安、鑽營奔走的奴性、民族精神、湮没已久、黃炎神胄、滅絶堪虞、總理救國救民爲己任、外抗帝國主義者之侵略、内抗滿淸政府之高壓、努力喚起國人、共謀革命四十年間、屢仆屢起、以不屈不撓之精神、機警明敏之手段、終能戰勝一切困危、逐步達到目的、滿淸之推倒、民國之建立、以至現今統一全國、施行訓政、拯中國民族於危亡、樹世界大同之基礎、此皆有賴於總理四十餘年之奮鬥與領導、及其人格遺敎之感召與昭示、吾人撫今追昔、確認倫敦之役、實爲我中國民族之生死關頭、幸天佑華胄、奸謀莫逞、留此偉大崇高之革命導師、以爲中國民族及世界人類謀福利、當此總理倫敦蒙難之三十四週年、吾人應加何竭誠紀念、</p>
<p>（二）倫敦蒙難是增加總理革命勇氣的推進機、倫敦蒙難是總理革命事業成功之關鍵、以後一切之成功、都與此有極大之關係、總理博大慈祥的人格、光明偉大的事業、俱因此而愈加光大、獲得國内外人士深切之同情與援助革命的勢力、因是而繼長增高、總理在其自著之倫敦被難記中有云、「予之知有政治生涯、實始於是年、予之以奔走國事、而使姓名騰諸英人之口、實始於是地」總理在此同情榮譽的空氣中、增加了無窮的革命之决心與勇氣總理脫險後、在歐洲考查各國的政治風俗、完成精深博大之三民主義、以爲中國革命之原則、革命的重心旣己確定、同志的趨附日益衆多、辛亥一役、卒告成功、故總理倫敦蒙難、在革命歴史上雖爲不不之事實、然就整個的革命意義而論、實爲中國國民革命運動的推進機、</p>
<p>（三）倫敦蒙難、不過爲總理所歴最大艱難之一、實則一生奮鬥、無時無刻不生活在此種蒙難狀態中、吾人紀念往蹟、緬想遺徽矺應具如何更下决心、誓死奮鬥、篤信主義、恪遵遺訓、發皇其艱難手創之黨國、完成吾人之重大責任、總理遺囑謂、「余致力國民革命、凡四十年、其目的在求中國之自由平等、」造成中國之不自由平等者、不外國際帝國主義者與國内之封建勢力、亦即爲總理畢生奮鬥之對象、近年以來、國際帝國主義者所加於我之壓迫、較前益烈尤以經濟的壓迫爲最甚、而國内之新舊軍閥、腐惡份子、又勾結帝國主義、聯合共產黨匪、不斷的拚命向本黨進攻、致本黨無時不在風雨飄摇之中、其形勢之嚴重、以視總理蒙難之時、殆又過之、吾人應如何效法總理、激發自勵、本不屈不撓之精神、作十盪十决之奮鬥、務須澈底撲滅一切反革命勢力、以仰慰總理在天之靈</p>
<p>標語口號　（一）總理精神不死、（二）總理是爲剷除滿淸專制政治而被難、（三）總理是中國民族的救星、（四）紀念倫敦蒙難票繼續總理奮鬥的精神、（五）紀念倫敦蒙難要努力完成總理的遺志、（六）撲滅叛黨逆徒軍閥餘孽及共產黨匪、（七）擁護總理艱難締造的中國國民黨、（八）實現三民主義（九）國民革命成功萬歲、中國國民黨上海特别市黨部宣傳部</p>

<h3>航界籌設航業銀行</h3>
<p>昨開創立會議</p>
<p>當塲簽認股欵</p>
<p>本埠航業、籌設航業銀行、以爲發展業務·收回航權之預備、兹因急於組織、由航業公會邀集各會員、討論進行辦法、已誌昨報、昨日午後、又召集各會員、開航業銀行第一次創立大會、會員到者有虞洽卿·沈仲毅·劉石蓀·陳順通·陳錫堂·王伯芬·徐忠信·張春敷·等、討論進行辦法、兹將議定組織情形、分紀如下、</p>
<p>集股經過　去年提議設立航業銀行時、原擬請海關、於進口輪船、加收噸鈔稅十分之三、以作銀行基金、當時曾經航會調查估計、如果實行、則華商輪之噸鈔稅上、約可增收二址六七萬元、上海商輪進出、以洋商船居多、增加三成、則外輪項下、约多納百餘萬元、當時華航商於增稅移作銀行基金、恐洋商不贊成、曾由航會主席虞洽卿、向英商太古·美商大來·等各輪公司接洽、探詢意見、而兩公司大班、對此竟表同情、嗣後因日船等未能一致、遂改變主張、額定基金二百萬元、除由航商分認之外、請政府發航業公債千萬、恊助成立、而增鈔主張、臨時取消、</p>
<p>認定股欵　昨日開會、對於股欵之籌集、首先提出討論、當經公决、由在會各會員輪公司、分别認定、以按照所有輪船多少、爲攤認股本標準、討論結果、按噸位攤派、以千噸爲單位、照海關註册噸爲根據、每一千噸認股一百股、每一股計洋一百元、當塲各會員一致同意、立即簽認、如招商局認股在四十餘萬元、三北合寗興鴻安認股爲十六萬元餘、其餘各公司大小有差、認定之額、先行繳納二分之一、俟開幕後、再收二分之一、</p>
<p>派員籌備　股欵簽認之後、即由各會員推定組織銀行之籌備委員、當塲舉出六人、（一）虞洽卿、三北公司主人、（二）袁履登、寗紹公司總理、（三）沈仲毅、招商局營業科長、（四）劉石蓀、南華公司經理、（五）王伯芬、政記公司經理、（六）陳幹靑、肇興公司總船主、即由此六委員負籌備全責、行址確定在廣東路永年公司舊址内、俟籌備竣事、再行開會决定開幕日期、</p>
<p>航債問題　請發航業公債一千萬元、以作銀行基金之一部、及救濟航業之用途者、兹經議定、該項公債、以關稅担保、請政府發交航業公會、再由航業公會轉交航業銀行、担任發行全責、當塲取决此項辦法、呈請財部准予核發矣、</p>
<p>洋商態度　虞洽老爲收回江海航權、設立航業銀行事、曾往訪在華英輪勢</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>力最巨之太古大班、叩詢其其意見、太古大班、對於華人收回航權、頗表同情、謂近年中國民氣確有蓬蓬勃勃振起之象、苟能在江海各路、華輪確能供商運需求、而無如過去之阻碍情形者、洋商亦不待華人之交涉、而將自動放棄矣、如滬甬綫内、太古之新北京輪、營業在三華輪之上、而本年自願放棄優越地位、與三華輪合作營業、將收入水脚、照八十分四家分攤、每家各得二十分、以新北京之所餘者、補新江天新寗紹及寗興輪之不足、今更自願退减得十八分、此即爲英商放棄中國内海航權之表示云、此次航業銀行成立、本埠之匯豐·麥加利·各外銀行、亦表示願與之援助、使中國航業起色云、</p>

<h3>國慶絮語</h3>
<p>— 楊家頥</p>
<p>紀念國慶。也有眞假之分。眞的紀念國慶者。看重在紀念國慶的意義方面。而假的紀念國慶者。却注重在浮泛的舉動方面。如開會遊藝等等。</p>
<p>發明雙十節的吳稚暉先生。曾說過這句話。「假使把我們慶祝國慶的熱烈的精神。來辦我們的事業。我們的事業没有不成功。一其言何等誠擎有味。</p>
<p>情侣們在國慶日。也录個幽期密約的好機會。所以他們在國慶日所慶祝的。不是國慶。乃是私慶。</p>
<p>莫看輕了國慶日的一筆慶祝的亷費。這筆糜費。在紙紥店和燈籠店老班看來。却是一項意外之財。</p>
<p>國慶日是多麽偉大的日子。所以我們在國慶日。要細想先烈抛了頭顱。洒了頸血的那種熱烈的犧牲精神。不是開個會和表演些遊藝便算了事的。</p>
<p>同是一個國慶紀念。在比較安閑區域的人們看來。是應該熱烈慶祝。以表示對國慶而快樂。但在戰雲瀰漫的區域的人們看來。却是祇好望國慶而興嘆了。</p>
<h3>十九年國慶</h3>
<p>— 程瞻廬</p>
<p>國慶之神步着地球先生的後塵。經了三百六十五日環日旅行而重到舊地。又來受民衆的歡迎了。有槍階級擎槍致敬。是慶祝。有筆階級摇筆致敬。也是慶祝。管城子脱了帽兒。喝飽了墨汁。颺颼的在玉版箋上跳舞。待订說些什麽話呢。要說些希望話吧。早給樂觀派先生們說過了。要說些牢騷話吧。又給悲觀派先生們說過了。要從雙十二字附會到重要人物的姓名上吧。又給拆字派的先生們說過了。要做一篇三十年或五十年後國慶日的未來記吧。又給算命派的先生們說過了。要做一篇華氏主人怎麽長怎麽短的寓言小說吧。又給理想派的先生們說過了。有一位朋友道。不對不對。這都是籠統文章。這都是靑布長衫式的文章。單袍上可罩。夾袍上可罩。棉袍皮袍上也可罩。今年國慶日可以如是云云。明年國慶日也可以如是云云。我以爲某年的國慶文章。便要指定某年生發。萬萬不可作通套語。以前往往把陰曆的生肖做材料。現在不適用了。國曆十九年的國慶日。該從十九二字生發。古來關於十九二字的紀載。恒有成功的希望。公子重耳得成霸業。是爲了十九年險艱備歷而成功的。蘇子卿牧羊歸來。是爲了十九年持節不變而成功的。屠牛坦游刃有餘。是爲了十九牛一朝盡解亡刃不頓而成功的。毛先生片言定從。是爲了十九人碌碌無奇因人成事而成功。這許多關於十九二字的佳話。都是今年慶祝國慶文章的好材料。我道。來年國慶怎麽樣。朋友道。二十年國慶的題目。益發好做了。二十年是雙十的年。雙十年逢雙十節。便是雙雙十。到了來年。我有一篇好文章發表。你拭着目瞧罷。</p>
<h3>十九年國慶之迴顧</h3>
<p>— 吳孝侯</p>
<p>民國誕生。距今已十有九年矣。此十九年中。封建惡勢力。洪憲軍閥。共產反動。相繼產生。或把持軍政。或乘機竊發。干戈擾攘。迄無寗日。而民生彫敝。災患頻仍。國勢不振。幾有累卵之危。追憶辛亥之秋。武漢一呼。全國響應。書生旣投筆從戎。女子亦抛針赴敵。紅粉跨桃花之馬。靑衿揮柳葉之刀。萬衆一心。始達共和之目的。不侫於彼時。亦曾管領滬江部一學生軍。躬冒矢石。親列戎行。迨表項城帝制自爲。不侫復著討袁論文。始登東吳大學勵進雜誌。繼復經滬上各報轉載。爲袁之偵探機關注意。幾遭不測。變裝改名。（原名品三嗣改今名）由東吳前美籍敎授。護送至申。始免於難。十五年國軍自珠江流域。延揚子江長驅直下。介公主席。轉戰鄂贛間。不侫亦曾隨三十三軍。於戰務有所贊襄。洎閻馮輸誠中央。不侫供職首都。方冀軍政時期。告一結束。由訓政而漸達憲政時期。臻國家於磐石之安。奠民生若苞桑之固。不意十八年秋。不侫方奉國府内政部文。赴東考察市政。於東京考察旣畢。在赴横濱至神户道中。忽得閻馮反動之消息。日本報紙。素對吾國政事。以造謡爲職志。擴大宣傳。山雨欲來風滿樓。身居異邦者。幾不知國内復達若何擾攘之狀况矣。邇者關外張學良氏。外觀環境。内察時機。效順中央。振臂一呼。閻馮之全軍盡墨。從此和平有望。統一可期。我國舊律規定。男子二十而冠。女子二十而嫁。本年爲十九年之雙十節國慶日。十九年前。猶在童年未成丁之時。措施一切。不免有錯雜蕪亂之行爲。十九年後。即爲成丁已冠之年。行見由訓政而憲政。納民軌物。漸入康莊。民生安定。民權旣循正軌而發皇。民族更得於國際上增高其地位。薰濡陶冶。化雨時行。行見由三民主義。以漸達大同之目的。使全世界日光所普照之地之各民族。盡爲我總理之信徒。則此後庭陳瓜。良宵私語。水濱携手。佳日閒游。飲水思源。此十九年之雙十國慶節。必將印於人人之心坎中矣。</p>
<h3>國慶回憶</h3>
<p>— 呂迪華女士</p>
<p>李師肖畘。湘中文學界聞人也。民九十年間。執敎鞭於長沙福湘女子中學。是時吾亦肄業斯校。李師每逢國慶日</p>
<p>必令諸生作歌。各寫胸中感慨。猶憶師自作有云。「剛剛過了中秋節。今日又逢雙十節。佳節抑何多。家家慶共和。共和眞幸福歌罷還須哭。歌哭總相連。回頭十一年。」撫今追昔。不勝感歎。八年來兵戎屢見。匪禍頻仍。今幸戰事將告終結。惟冀匪患早除。從事建設。致中國於富强。是則吾之慶祝國慶也。</p>
<h3>國慶新食譜</h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>當此國慶佳節。窮思極想。在肚腸角裏找到了幾種新食譜。自願放棄專利權。寫出來告訴自由談者。當做一種國慶的禮物吧。</p>
<p>雙十糕　用糯米粉製。中間不必用饀。面舖粉紅色粉。用模型印成雙十式樣。雙十爲我華同胞。脫離滿淸專制政府之日。吃雙十糕。便永久不忘雙十國慶了。</p>
<p>中山湯　中山湯不用醬油。以表中山先生一身的廉潔。用甜酸苦辣四味調成。蓋中山先生一生。倍嘗甜酸苦辣。而能具大無畏精神。使革命成功。吃中山湯亦能使我人百折不撓。與惡勢力奮鬥到底。而具有大無畏精神。</p>
<p>靑白麵　中國國旗黨旗。均有靑天白日。而所謂靑白麵者。用靑菜燒麵。製成之後。其色靑白相間。適與黨國旗相合。吃靑白麵。則必愛好和平。守身如玉。</p>
<p>民衆糰　民衆糰用米粉製成。不必用饀。中山先生謂中華民族。一盤散沙。此後如不能團結。則不足與帝國主義相抗。吃民衆糰可使民衆團結起來。抵抗一切外來的壓迫。</p>
<p>三民糉　三民糉用糯米裹成。中置饀子三種。甜鹹皆可。形則三角。以表民權民族民生三生義。蓋國人對於三民主義。大都尚未明瞭。吃三民糭能使民衆明瞭三民主義。以救中國。</p>
<p>五權包　五權包用麵粉製。用饀子。甜鹹不拘。成五角形。以表五權。食五權包。民衆可知五權制之施行。而運用四大民權實行民權主義。</p>
<p>齊心粥　用米四萬萬顆　煑而成粥。以表四萬萬民衆。能和合一致。齊心對外。吃齊心粥。可使四萬萬同胞。萬衆一心。打倒帝國主義。扶持弱小民族。實現民族主義。</p>
<p>完了。這微薄的禮物。請讀者諸君大家不客氣的領受下來。依法去嘗試一下吧。</p>
<h3>樽邊趣聞</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>日前友人楊君邀飲於庽廬。一時狼虎雲集。大快朶頣。嗣主人發起。各說笑話或趣聞一則。違者罰飲一盃。引種鬨堂。各賀一盃。於是互展妙緒。詼諧雜出。有足令人噴飯者。兹撮述數則。聊供一噱。然醉鄉趣史居其二。蓋仍不脫醉人本色焉。</p>
<p>去了一年　座有劉君。謂一日行經法租界八仙橋附近。有一挑擔薙髮匠。在路旁爲某甲剃頭。正在手揮目送從事上層工人之際。忽有二西捕至。厲聲驅逐。薙髮匠亟携擔遁去。甲呆若木雞。時大好頭顱。剛剃了一半。捕與旁觀者均大笑。甲施抱頭鼠竄而去。大約追踪該理髮匠。覔相當地點。繼續其工作。有多數行人覩此怪頭尚莫明所以。西捕雖似惡作劇。然而趣矣。</p>
<p>再來一個　有某君謂曩庽法租界某里時。曾遇一罕有之趣聞。里中房屋鱗次櫛比。均係單幢。俗稱東洋房子。居者多小户。開門即見床舖。有甲乙二人比隣而居。一夕甲扶醉歸。醉態糢糊。誤叩乙門。乙歸聞而啓户。案頭燈忽爲風熄。婦旣不辨眞相。誤爲藁砧。低斥曰。日戒汝少飲。何今又沉醉至是。甲旣入。摸索登牀。婦復挑燈從事女紅。未幾。忽聞門外又有剝啄聲。婦驚問爲誰。則答者儼然乙也。婦大駭。亟啓帳諦視。而酣臥者赫然爲隔隣之甲。皇急莫知所措。匆匆拔關。乙入室。婦告以鵲巢鳩占事。乙怒氣塡膺。但以婦尚未睡。且證以平日行徑。亦不疑有不貞事。乃曳甲起。數之曰。臥榻之旁。尚不容他人鼾睡。矧爲入幕之賓。差幸牀頭人猶未入睡。否則不更貽老夫羞耶。甲摩挲醉眼。唯唯自認不合。跟蹌而去。最趣者。甲婦聞其事。疑甲與乙婦通。酸興勃發。經甲力白無他。一塲趣劇。遂告閉幕。</p>
<p>俠少送行　友人鈕君。夙嗜杯中物。一夕飲於北市。以家庽新閘。乃搭電車歸。時已醉態可掬。繼忽沉沉入睡。迨車抵戈登路。售票人呼之不應。有少年見其衣冠楚楚。貌似長者。特喚之醒。掖其下車。並詢其庽址。扶送至家。君夫人遽責少年曰。汝等年紀輕。何不加諒。使彼爛醉如此。少年謂本係陌路相逢。並非相識。特憐其宵行多險。故伴送至府。夫人慚而謝。少年亦辭去君謂如少年之古道俠腸。求之叔季。洵不可多覯。惜不審其姓氏里居云</p>
<p>誌謝與介紹　吾吳管一得先生名畫師也。嘗任寗波省立中學國畫教授。成績卓著。近以四方索畫者衆。因辭職家居。專治繪事。海上諸大箋扇店均代爲收件。日數十起。昨承撥冗繪賜觀瀑圖一幅。高逸脫俗。洵非凡手。專此誌謝。兼爲介紹。（瘦鵑）</p>
<h3>國慶日之夜</h3>
<p>— 范菊高</p>
<p>光陰過得眞快。可愛的雙十節。又在目前了。回想去年的國慶。還很是明白。津津然有餘味哩。那一夜。本鎭舉行一個盛大的提燈會。各界都參加的。我因爲想拿一盞精緻的燈。便自出心裁。用紙竹糊製起來。可是。我的手工。不甚高明。並且又不曾在巧玲瓏學過三年。所以成了一隻四不像的燈。作長方形。好像街上測字先生所用的。我因爲親自製造。煞費經營。便很高興的拿着。雖然路上的人看見了。十個人中間。有九個半人哂笑。我却終是「笑駡由他笑駡。好燈我自提之」到。了賽會回家。送給女兒華玲。伊非常快活。以爲是世界上最美麗最巧妙的燈。愛如拱璧。我就更覺愉快了。</p>
<p>在游行的路上。小學生們的燈。時常熄滅。熄滅的原因很多。一是被風吹滅。還有一層。是插燭的釘歪了所致。伊們提了不光明而黑暗的燈。時常哭喪着臉。要我替伊們燃。我呢預料要當這個職務。在臨行的時候。袋子裏放着好幾個紙吹。彷彿書塲裏的裝水烟的。一得了伊們的請求。便立刻同伊們燃。不肯使伊們的燈。有長時間的黑暗。而致提燈人的不快。可是此明彼熄。東也要燃。西也要燃。二百多個小朋友。由我們三四個同事燃火。忙得幾乎連脚也要舉起來。不但這樣忙碌。並且還有一層苦痛。就是我們的手指。給那蠟燭火。燙了不少的傷㾗。當時我們興緻很好。便甘之如飴。到了下一天。在家中休息。伸出十箇指頭來看。幾乎嚇呆。原來蠟燭油紅的白的。染滿指縫裏。燙傷的腫㾗。却遍指皆是。仔細審視。竟好像一幅戰墟圖呢。唉。像這樣的苦痛。爲什麽我們不引爲悲哀的事。反欣欣然覺得有味呢。都因爲愛國之心。人皆有之。時局太平。四方安樂。才舉行這麽盛大的提燈會。我們旣是國民的一份子。應當狂歡慶祝。載歌載舞。忘掉一切的痛苦才是啊。現在。十九年的國慶日又來了。我希望再和去年一樣。把十箇指頭。燙上幾燙。同時要希望前線的戰事。早些結束。永久能夠和平。使全中國的民衆。都能享受太平的福。氣。那麽年年今日舉行盛大的提燈會。豈不是格外有興呢。</p>

<h3>金融金市未離軟局</h3>
<p>飄忽的市氣　昨九日標金跌風頻仍、惟時有藴伏、計三四兩盤旋、統市共計五兩有零差額、人心趨萎、外匯略形鬆動、銀行出納不等、市塲上各號交易、頗爲活潑、然購售紛異、前市志豐永福昌及大連帮胥有買進、大德成生大太興等咸是賣出頭寸、至於大條銀復見跌落、於是早初遂漲無如賣氣奮勇、急轉下乘、慘落五兩、惟自晨至午時見興替、實緣求供顚沛、以致飄摇不定、迨後市並無特殊變遷而大德成及套頭號家有所售出、志豐永順利元成永等則進、而價祇有一二兩旋轉、惟潛和緩之烈最後站在六十六兩以外、今日國慶紀念、銀錢兩業均是休假、故金市殆亦休息一天、</p>
<p>多變的晨盤　至十一月份標金初開即漲一兩二錢、爲五百六十九兩八錢、蓋銀條回縮十六分之一、銀價縮八分之一、日英匯兌則加三十二分之一、歐市買賣不惰、花旗市面則有賣出也、故人心尚好往後永亨生大等頗有供給、當即下降四五兩、至先令揭佈勿更時爲六十五兩光景、復以英金見穏、台灣正金都有納進、計十二月分七辨七四三七五、元月七辨士半、並由福昌志豐永等相繼上塲爭購、乃價一跳三兩以外、至十點三刻爲六十八兩六七錢、入後大德成信亨等傾向脫手、市况轉穏爲頽、頃刻一蹶不據之慨、計暴落四兩、至十一點半降爲六十四兩五錢俄而回上一兩、計五兩五六錢、復又降至五兩以内、迨正午收盤計六十五兩一錢、繼續做大幾錢、以爲五兩半左右、揭價仍爲六百二十一兩、初撳五十五六兩、嗣後五十三兩、午刻仍抑小五十六兩、</p>
<p>和緩的後市　下午開盤六十六兩、繼爲六十五兩六七錢、復聞印匯回小一二安那、遂加至六十六兩三四錢、志豐永等稍進、匯市平定、住友出十二月日金一兩二錢五分八七五、匯豐出英金七辨士四三七五、往後大德成等售出、即退一兩零、二點半爲五兩一二錢復由三菱吸元月英金七辨士半、良以元成永福興永等來買、故至二點以後計爲六十七兩一二錢、惟時有一兩之起仆、入後匯豐售出十一月份七辨士四三七五、係荷比等吸進、然塲内套頭者均有脫售、殆四點後抑爲六十六兩三錢、迨四點三十分收般計六十六兩六錢、比較前日計跌二兩、復又抑至六兩光景、查一日間最大價六十九兩八錢、最小價六十四兩半、計有五兩三錢、迴顧揭價計撳五十五兩内外、登賬本月六十九兩、下月六十五兩、補水六十九兩、下午七十一兩、物品早市九兩七錢、午時五兩半、午後六兩、收市六兩、</p>
<p>活潑的交易　各號交易、計志豐永·福昌·恒興·順利·萬興等均買進、元茂永、大德成出多人少、信亨·源成約共二千多條大約扯平、太興·生大·太康潤均進、約共三千數百條、餘大·永康·永豐等出人無定、下午元成永·福興永·順利·志豐永均進、大德成·元茂永·餘大等則出、尚有零户、乍出進、爲數有限、大連帮售出五六百條、則買進一千多條、廣帮約出二千餘條、以食匯票也云、</p>
<h3>外匯隨金市軟化</h3>
<p>昨海外銀市突見低落、交易尚勤、英美匯率略有升降、日英見漲、日美如前、匯豐掛牌仍無變更、至内部初平後萎、下午轉平、惟無過於榮辱終則似疲、比諸前午、計英金長零六二五、美金長一二五、日金則減二五、殆以標金續潛軟化、業中求供紛歧、人心趨低也、而各匯華商投機家交易尚不尠、計英金成交十餘萬鎊、銀行如正金·台灣·三菱等均有納進、匯豐·安達·往友·華比等咸已賣出、而金業中大致套做金子、又美金各行互做十餘萬元、至日匯大連帮售出數十萬元、係正金朝鮮等吸進、又各號曾結一二十萬元、住友賣出也、惟市况仍在盤旋中、人心恍惚靡常云、</p>
<p>英匯　内盤僅以零六二五上落、自早間舉十·十一月出價同爲一先令七辨士三一二五、十二正月計三七五、買進照加零六二五、而掉期已見接近矣、正金於早市買一月一萬鎊、價七辦士四三七五、後臺灣買十二月一萬、價四三七五至半辨士、正金買一月一萬、價半辨士、安達·住友·華比售與正金本月二三萬、價三七五、正金買一月五千、價四三七五、午收十十一月出價三七五、進價四三七五、十二正月出價四三七五、進價七辨士五、下午匯豐出十二月一萬、價四三七五、又出一月五千、價半辨士、三菱買五千、價同、匯豐賣與華比·大通十一月二萬、價四三七五、收市與午收相同、</p>
<p>美匯　内盤計有一二五上落、自上中近期（十十一月）出價三十九元一二五、十二正月計三十九元二五、買價照加一二五、午收近期三十九元二五、遠期三七五、下午安達與上海對做十月五萬元、價三十九元三一二五、收市平和、</p>
<p>東匯　内盤前後市約共一分外之廻旋、交易不旺、掉期似見拉攏、自早晨十月出價一兩二錢六分七五、十一月六分二五、十二月五分七五、一月五分半、買價均减半分、朝鮮於早初吸現大連十萬元、價一兩二錢六分六二五、正金吸本月日金十萬元、七分、午收十月出價六分、一月四分七五、下午住友出十二月十萬元、五分八七五、收市十月一兩二錢六分五、十一月六分二五、十二月五分七五、一月五分五、買價仍然各减半分云、</p>
<h3>銀價英美一致轉縮</h3>
<p>昨據倫敦電訊、大條銀復轉微縮、脚地中國銀行界賣出投機家則進、市堅、收盤後花旗趁此售出、故市面轉平、計近遠期均縮另六二五、同爲十六辨士半、（合英金爲一先令七辨士五）、又接紐約電訊、美銀價亦回縮一二五、爲三角五分七五、英對美加上零三一二五、爲四元八角五分、九八七五、美對英計另九三七五、計四元八角五分九六八七五、日美仍爲四十九元六二五、日英加上零三一二五、計二先令零半、英滬先令仍爲一先令七辨士七五、孟買無電、又當日上午十點二十分路透電到、均亦上增、計日美加上零六二五、爲四十九元五六二五、日英升零三一二五、計二先令零四六八七五、又電通社來始終未更、計近期日美出入價同爲四十九元五六二五、日英出入價計二先令零四六八七五、至五三一二五、遠期日美出入價計四十九元三七五至半、日英出入價爲二先令零四零六二五、至四三七五云云、</p>
<h3>釐拆相將下游</h3>
<p>市場槪况　最近洋厘形勢因受外埠來源洶湧、影響結果、相將隳落、就一星期間市面面論差頗已達半分之巨、如果在兩三星期間之比較不下七八厘矣、所幸跌勢徐而不疲、尚未引起業外人之重視並不致有意外之變掛、好在維持市面者、總能調盈劑虛、必致七鬯不驚耳、</p>
<p>厘拆價格　（洋厘）早市爲七錢二分八厘、午市爲七錢二分七厘二毫半、結果較前日午市共跌一厘三毫七忽半、市上供方仍復爭趨故形勢猶有看低、（銀拆）早市較前晨好起三分、計爲一錢五分、而午市忽聞頭襯孔多、市氣遂鬆、銀拆復落至七分、銀行掛牌爲六分、劃頭加水因市氣旣鬆、遂告無加水而白劃矣、</p>
<p>輔幣市情　江南小洋、早午兩市同爲六錢五分一厘半、較前日跌小一厘半、做出交易有限、早市六千角午市祇二千角、廣東小洋早市爲六錢三分七厘七毫半、午市亦復雷同、而較前日午市又弱二毫半、做出交易、早市十三萬角、午市六萬角、銅元仍爲三百八十八千文、</p>
<p>銀洋進出　（銀欵）昨日銀行收解寥落、華商收解票欵一百七十餘萬、外商收解票欵僅一百二十餘萬、各種貨匯稅什諸欵收解八百餘萬、出倉一百十萬、日商銀行收解各欵三百四十餘萬、出倉三十萬、錢莊銀公單收解三千二百餘萬、劃頭欵收解三百二十餘萬、各路匯欵收解七十餘萬收現一百餘萬、（洋欵）匯劃票欵、早市做出一百三十三萬午市做出七十六萬、鈔票早市四萬、午市十一萬、塲外鈔票早市十四萬、午市七萬二千銀行交易、早市互市五十萬、午市五十二萬各銀行洋户往來收解一百三十餘萬、鈔票進出一百五十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解四百三十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百二十餘萬、拆惜洋欵收解一百十餘萬、客路來源、杭州二十四萬各埠五十餘萬、去胃三十餘萬、小同行做開鈔票匯兌等新幣六七十萬</p>
<h3>證劵　九六月設法整理之訊</h3>
<p>昨竟暴漲二元半</p>
<p>今日國慶紀念、證交停止市塲交易、至昨市現貨進出依然稀少、期市上午平靜、復市略轉活動、債價大致平穏、惟九六忽有重大變化、市上因傳有設法整理之訊、一時需要頓佳、市價每盤步堅、下午漲勢尤勁、結果比前續漲二元有半、其變動實出意外、他債似較爲沉悶、前後市始終盤旋、即較諸前日、亦互有漲跌、爲數多祗數角、計全日現貨成交一萬七千元、期貨八百六十餘萬元、内裁兵編遣佔額仍較鉅、關稅一九捲平平九六較佳、其他則寥落如前、</p>

<h3>紗花實銷不暢中之標紗</h3>
<p>三品雖漲……人標尤跌兩許</p>
<p>紗市平疲、實因節後現紗仍無大量起色、兼之海外依然平澹、惟三品紗回漲二三元、然大部份心思因現銷不暢、生產未免有過乘之虞、故潮帮猛力抛賢、市勢又鬆、雖某廠仍無放鬆之念、然大勢情形、難脫軟象、總之現銷不旺、市價頻難上漲也、</p>
<p>人標潮帮抛出二千包人標前市開擊以美棉微漲、人氣仍澹、場中買户缺乏、各跌四五七八九錢、午後潮帮抛出二千餘包、市價尤跌一二錢、全日成交統計一萬四千三百包、查賣出協生二千六百五十包、義餘八百包、其餘三五百包、買進達記七百包、愼昌六百包、其他三四百包、兹將人標收盤價錄左</p>

<h3>棉花一味傾向下游</h3>
<p>棉市趨跌、實以美棉生產又增十餘萬包、價格雖微漲本埠人心反虛、實以擯持已久、今視美棉披而不振、散多了結、市價遂落、但漢帮仍拉緊不放、大批内地帮亦安然不動、故跌風未熾、現棉各廠毫無採辦之意、棉市前途未可樂觀、不過有一部份以四鄉農户不肯賤售、暫時或有小反動也、</p>
<p>漢標破入二兩關　漢標前市開盤、以美棉微漲、人氣平疲、賣勢較盛、各跌二三錢、午後有一部份扒空、回漲五分、全日成交統計五萬六千二百担查賣出利昌六千七百担、天昌四千担、其他一·二千担、買進恒大八百担、源大三千七百担、信誠二千八百担、愼昌二千三百担、天隆二千七百担、其餘一二千担、兹將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>糧食米市平疲不一</h3>
<p>今日國慶紀念一律停市</p>
<p>閘北　昨　各帮到埠米船計二十餘號、走銷初滯後爽、新粳在晨間極呆木價續軟化嗣因今日國慶停斛、店方進意轉爽、高貨遂告平定仍開十七元七角、中關則反覺微挺、然非正式市面、薄稻到貨漸旺、行情又跌半元、頂貨開十六元四五角、杜子秈市本街問津尚股、來源不甚湧旺、價無升降、羊尖埠尖消化欠佳、貨雖不多但因人心不振、乃步短兩三角、客秈車到甚接、去路不化回落三四角不等、茭白秈高開十三元關左、大盤亦告下游、全市各秈一致平疲、東新粳廠方積貨不厚、市勢平定、高貨開十五元七八角、變元穏立、陳貨十七元半、新貨十五元零、情况無榮辱、陰元亦由疲趨平、交易極形平淡、</p>
<p>滬南　昨日河到二三十號、本街銷場不振、破粳尚有零星見抵、特高開十七元零、中等新粳如蘇同崑山等貨、到源頗聯、買氣沉寂、行情因之萎疲、大盤見小兩三角、南帮各窰種薄稻節節下游、市况呆而無神價跌三四角、大盤開十五元五六角、通變陰元隨到隨銷、盤面與上日相彷、羊杜秈步軟角左常帮高貨開十二元三四角、廠機新秈零銷不暢、鄉胃亦觀望、是以價格續小角許、特高十元零八九角、</p>
<h3>津帮忽購近期粉</h3>
<p>午後市面稍形回好</p>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份大致盤旋、與前日不相上下、迨至下午開盤、因近期月份、津帮頻有購進、或一部分向廠家抽買現貨、至致人心穏固、遠期亦因近期之故、均見帶好一點、惟洋麥報價依然小去二三四角不等、故人心雖穏、成交量數殊見冷淡、現後步非有大銷場、當不致有過分之漲風也、結果本月份至十二月份各好七厘半、一月份好五厘、二月份好七厘半、三月份好一分二厘半云</p>
<h3>小麥跌後大漲</h3>
<p>昨日期麥上午開盤時、各月份因洋麥報價仍小、各月份較前日小一二分不等、旋以本月份之空頭、因檢騐費用關係目下尚未决定、與產區有關之行家、均一律去電暫時止裝致到源不免感到缺乏、所以人心反佳接續抵補、本月份最高時曾回漲到四兩七錢一分、與上午初價亦差至九分之巨、遠期各月份亦因此故、空户續補、新多頭略呈勇氣、同時見俏、結果本月份較前日漲六分、十一月份漲三分　十二月正月份漲二分、二月份漲三分、三月份漲四分、現麥特高貨喊價見佳、中次仍軟統市開山東白麥·宿遷·瑶灣麥五千四包百、由曲阜申大辦去云、</p>
<h3>洋米新成交一千包</h3>
<p>昨日客秈到頭不多、而本街鄉莊之外、建帮忽起購辦、市形立見轉機、價乃回好五六分、統市成交江西機早五百包、價十元零九角至三角、又機元七十六包、價十五元、又南京糙米三百包、價八元至八元一角、洋米自日前抵埠後、迄無受主、昨始售開特别一號西貢（即安南粳）一千包、價爲十四元五角七分、普通與中次西貢、仍無去化云、</p>
<h3>絲茶俄莊開辦後之茶訊</h3>
<p>本埠洋莊茶市、近數日來、因俄莊銷路復活、交易略旺、貢熙綠茶及寗州紅茶、俄莊購入之數、不下六七千餘箱、惟旣下貢熙名茶市盤、華茶商每擔所受虧折、已有二十餘之鉅、日來俄茶師鑒於該行之足以操縱市面、又復乘機抑價、退盤割價諸事、層見疊出、識者認爲今後華茶對俄貿易、非組織統一機關、其失敗可立而待云、</p>
<h3>黃白廠經價均漲</h3>

<h3>Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Last Will</h3>
<p>For forty years, I have dedicated myself to the National Revolution. My aim is to seek freedom and equality for China. Through forty years of experience, I deeply understand that to achieve this goal, it is imperative to awaken the people and unite with those nations in the world that treat us equally to strive together.</p>
<p>Now, the revolution has not yet succeeded. All my comrades must continue to work hard in accordance with my "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction," "Outline of National Reconstruction," the Three Principles of the People, and the declaration of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang, in order to thoroughly implement them. In particular, they must promote the convening of a National Assembly and the abolition of unequal treaties within the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>This is my earnest wish.</p>
<p>National Day Essays</p>
<h3>China's Due Position in the International Arena by Wang Zhengting</h3>
<p>Every nation should have its proper position in the international arena.</p>
<p>And the acquisition of this position must rely on a nation's credibility and strength. This is a consensus among those who study international politics. Our country has such a vast territory, such a large population, and such an ancient culture. It should be a first-class power in the world. However, in reality, the difference is vast. The restriction of unequal treaties is the main reason. The late Premier Sun Yat-sen knew this, so he especially instructed us to abolish unequal treaties. We have received this instruction for several years now. However, the results have not been as satisfactory as we had hoped. Why is this? Treaties are the crystallization of the strength of both parties. The strength of our country today is still not enough to compete with the great powers, and domestic rebellions frequently occur. We cannot immediately demonstrate the fact of unity and consolidation to friendly nations. Therefore, there are many difficulties in abolishing treaties, which is to be expected. However, we must not be discouraged by this. Therefore, in the past two years, customs duties have been completely autonomous, and the recovery of concessions and leased territories is also in progress, with the aim of gradually completing it. However, what we rely on now is credibility. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it has declared to friendly nations its willingness to abolish the old treaties and renegotiate new treaties through reasonable and legal procedures. For three years, the policy has been consistent. This alone is enough to show that we in the international community respect morality and value credibility. Friendly nations also deeply understand this, so they have sent envoys to Nanjing to present their credentials. Officials and guests mingled joyously, and the event was celebrated both at home and abroad. Even during this Northern Expedition, when the nation was experiencing multiple events, the trust of foreign countries in our National Government has not diminished. It can be seen that although our country's strength is not yet sufficient, the government's credibility has greatly increased. If we can maintain this spirit and continue to forge ahead, completing unification and consolidating the central government on one hand, and increasing national credibility externally and internal strength internally, then the acquisition of the position we deserve in the international arena can be expected soon.</p>
<h3>Peace and Unification by He Yingqin</h3>
<p>The Xinhai Revolution, through the bloodshed and sacrifice of many martyrs and patriots, as well as the immense suffering and losses of the people of the whole country, was able to overthrow the monarchical autocracy of the Qing Dynasty and establish the foundation of the Republic of China. The Double Tenth Festival, which was created through such hardship and difficulty, naturally deserves to be commemorated and celebrated joyfully by the people of the whole country every year. However, we should not overlook that the Xinhai Revolution only put up an empty signboard of the Republic of China, and did not build the reality of the Republic of China. From the point of view of overthrowing the Qing Dynasty, it can be considered a success. From the point of view of the entire goal of the revolution, it must be considered a failure. The goal of the revolution is not only to overthrow the Qing Dynasty, not only to obtain the empty name of the Republic of China, but to create a new China of the Three Principles of the People, freedom, and equality. Therefore, as we commemorate National Day today, we should not only rejoice and sing praises of peace. The entire nation must continue to work hard to enrich the content of the Republic of China and complete the entire success of the revolution. Only then will it not lose the meaning of commemorating National Day.</p>
<p>From the establishment of the Republic of China to the Northern Expedition in the thirteenth year, it was entirely a period of feudal warlords fighting and dividing the country. At the same time, it was also a period when revolutionary efforts were nurtured and grew. After the Northern Expedition, it was a period when revolutionary forces and feudal warlords began to engage in formal combat. Now it is almost the period when the feudal warlords are collapsing and dying out. In the first two periods, the people of the whole country could not avoid the pain and losses of war. The elimination of war and the realization of peace must be after the collapse and demise of the feudal warlords. Therefore, if the people of the whole country hope to get rid of the suffering of war as soon as possible, they should strive to promote the collapse and demise of the feudal warlords. Only then can they achieve their own goals.</p>
<p>Revolution and counter-revolution are irreconcilable. The advancement of revolutionary forces often leads to the union of counter-revolutionary forces. All the reactionary elements who have taken advantage of the revolution for their own benefit in the past, because the internal strength of the revolution has reached a certain level, can no longer hide under the banner of revolution and are good at mutually exploiting and colluding with each other, forming a kind of corrupt and filthy great unity as a final struggle. Therefore, the more the revolutionary forces advance, the more the counter-revolutionary enemies will be exposed and increased, and the revolutionary environment will become more dangerous. The greatest enemies of the National Revolution are imperialism, warlords, and the Communist Party. These three kinds of enemies are all beneficial to the disintegration of China and detrimental to the unification of China, beneficial to the failure of the National Revolution and detrimental to the success of the National Revolution. When the revolutionary forces are weak and do not obviously harm their interests, they seem to be able to barely tolerate them. Once they feel that the revolutionary forces and their own interests are about to come into conflict, they will use all means to rise up and destroy the revolution. The past facts are exactly like this. Taking the Communist Party as an example, before the Northern Expedition in the thirteenth year, they only mixed in with our party to carry out activities. Once the strength of our party progressed and reached Wuhan and Shanghai, and had the potential to unify China, the Communist Party, which was detrimental to our party's unification of China and the entire National Revolution, became extremely anxious and had to do everything possible to destroy our party and split our party.</p>
<p>Secondly, the imperialists, when the National Government was entrenched in a corner of Guangdong, believed that it was not very harmful and instead came to deal with it from time to time. But when the revolutionary army reached the Yangtze River, foreign warships were dispatched one after another, as if facing a great enemy. When it reached the Yellow River, some people simply disregarded everything and sent troops to China, creating the Jinan Massacre. As for the actions of the warlords, it goes without saying. When the revolutionary army attacked and captured Wuhan, Sun Chuanfang did not feel it necessary to support Wu Peifu. But today, when the Northern Expedition is completed, Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan, whose interests are extremely incompatible, can encircle each other. Now, it is not only the union of warlords and warlords, but the great union of all reactionary forces of warlords, the Communist Party, and imperialism. We see that when the central army's campaign against Yan and Feng was the fiercest, the Communist Party desperately killed and set fires in the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, disrupting the rear. The newspapers of the imperialists desperately fabricated rumors. The warships of the imperialists openly protected reactionary elements in places reached by the central forces, plotting activities. In summary, the warlords, the Communist Party, and the imperialists all harbor the same hope for China. What is this hope? It is, as Mr. Hu Zhantang said, the hope that we will unify and unify again, but never be unified, especially unwilling to complete unification under the leadership of the Chinese Kuomintang. Because if the Kuomintang unifies, China must realize the Three Principles of the People. If the Three Principles of the People are realized, then the warlords will not be able to survive, imperialism will have no way to invade, and the Communist Party will also lose its opportunity to cause chaos and run rampant. Therefore, although the interests of the warlords, the Communist Party, and the imperialists are different, their common goal is to destroy unification and obstruct the National Revolution. Therefore, the current situation of great reactionary union has been created, leading to the central government's suppression of local rebellions and the unending wars.</p>
<p>The situation of the country has indeed reached an extremely dangerous point. Imperialists are not only watching and hesitating, unwilling to easily allow the abolition of unequal treaties, but also trying their best to help China's internal strife, in order to maintain their improperly acquired rights. The Communist Party burns, kills, loots, and is biased towards the southeast. Eight or nine out of ten people in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi cannot live and work in peace. Warlords, on the other hand, arbitrarily create chaos and disregard the lives of the people, and their ambition will not die until the water runs dry and the mountains are exhausted. The central government has no way to stop the chaos and can only suppress it. Once the war starts, what will be the suffering of the people in the war zone? How great will be the losses of the whole country? China, which was originally in a semi-colonial state, has been subjected to the economic exploitation of imperialists for decades, and its production has declined. It is already impossible to recover. In addition, frequent wars have caused farmers to lose their fields, merchants to close their businesses, and workers to lack places to work. People with knowledge and specialized skills cannot find appropriate uses. Unemployment has increased sharply, and people are thinking of chaos. If this continues, the national economy will completely bankrupt and the national vitality will completely cease. Therefore, at this time, it is not just a few people with insight who will guide and</p>
<p>promote peace. In fact, the people of the whole country do not need peace and long for peace. However, we must know that unity and peace have an inseparable relationship. If there is unity, there will naturally be peace. Without unity, peace cannot be realized. The National Government has always</p>
<p>taken peaceful unification as its policy. Over the years, it has tried its best to enlighten and seek comprehensive solutions for the ambitions of the Gui clique and Yan, so as to restore the inherent moral intelligence and talent to save the Chinese nation from its roots.</p>
<p>To create true equality and freedom, we must catch up with the world's culture.</p>
<p>Everyone must sacrifice freedom so that the country can be free.</p>
<p>Everyone must contribute their ability so that the country has ability.</p>
<p>National Day of the Republic of China, Nineteenth Year</p>
<p>Respectfully written by Dai Chuanxian</p>
<p>and Feng, etc. However, Li Zongren and Hu Zongduo have already stated that they will give the central army a head-on blow. Can the central government listen to their head-on blow without responding? Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang have already mobilized their troops to attack Xuzhou and Nanjing. Can the central government just let it go? The development of the warlords' private desires cannot be tolerated by the central government's tolerance. The warlords' habit of being obsessed with evil cannot be effective by the central government's influence. Tolerance is impossible, and influence is impossible. The troublemakers have already openly betrayed the central government and attacked the central government. May I ask, should the central government allow them to run rampant and harm the people and the country, or should it rectify the national discipline, protect the survival of the nation, and implement the suppression of the rebellion with an indisputable responsibility? The war has reached this point, and it is of course inevitable to avoid the past facts. The revolutionary central government is not engaging in military aggression, but is tolerating and cannot avoid it. Then, it is forced to suppress the rebellion with pain. The purpose of suppressing the rebellion is to suppress the chaos and stop the chaos. It is not to avoid peace, but to seek true</p>
<p>and permanent peace. The cause of the war is due to the warlords' creation of chaos, not due to the central government's suppression of the rebellion. Therefore, if the feudal warlords are not removed for a day, then division, division, plotting chaos, and harming the country, the so-called peace is almost impossible to see. To avoid war, we must recognize the warlords who create chaos and eliminate the causes of the chaos. The reason why the Xinhai Revolution failed was because many party members at that time did not fully believe in the Premier and did not implement it in accordance with the Premier's principles, policies, and strategies. They easily handed over political power to Yuan Shikai, the leader of the counter-revolution. As a result, the counter-revolutionary forces grew and eventually destroyed the revolutionary forces, forming an invincible warlord, and causing more than ten years of internal strife in the country. If we want to appease the people, the suffering of the people will become deeper. If we want to seek peace, peace will never be possible. This kind of failure gives us the greatest lesson. We should know in the future that permanent peace must be sought in the demise of the counter-revolutionary forces. If we only know peace and do not know unity, and do not know that we must achieve the Three Principles of the People through unity, then the situation of temporary compromise will sow the seeds of war again. Revolutionary comrades and compatriots, what we need is true unity and permanent peace. We want to complete the National Revolution and build a new China of the Three Principles of the People. We should not be afraid of indecision and temporarily seek a moment of peace, and forget about the disaster of war that is about to spread endlessly.</p>
<p>We must know that during the time of warlord melee before the thirteenth year, the so-called Zhili-Anhui War was Wu Peifu and Duan Qirui fighting. The Jiangsu-Zhejiang War was Qi Xieyuan and Lu Yongxiang fighting. So some people simply called it the Zhili-Anhui War and the Qi-Lu War, which is more in line with the facts. This kind of Zhili-Anhui War and Qi-Lu War are completely different in meaning compared to the current war. In the past, it was a private struggle and mutual killing, but now it is the revolutionary central government suppressing the rebellious warlords. In other words, it is a war between revolution and counter-revolution. Private struggles often reach a point where both sides are exhausted. As long as a few peacemakers come out to mediate, it is fine because there is nothing to speak of to each other. It may be okay to talk about peace, and the situation of compromise is established. As for the war between revolution and counter-revolution, there is absolutely no compromise. There are only three results: (1) The revolutionary forces cannot defeat the feudal forces and suffer a setback. (2) The demise of the feudal warlords. (3) The repentance and surrender of the feudal warlords. In the first case, although the revolutionary forces suffer a setback, they will eventually make rapid progress to achieve final victory. The lessons of the failure of the Xinhai Revolution promoted the progress of this revolution. Therefore, we can say that the revolution only has victory. The so-called failure is also the preparation for victory and the opportunity for success. The revolution has not yet succeeded, and the counter-revolutionary forces are rampant, vying for land and cities, and killing endlessly. There is no slightest dawn of peace. Therefore, warlord separatism only leads to continuous war. Only when all the warlords are eliminated by the revolutionary forces or repent and truly surrender to the revolution can there be so-called peace. Can you get permanent peace? To go a step further, the war between revolution and counter-revolution is not a personal issue. Then, the so-called surrender of the warlords is certainly not a concession or surrender of person to person. At a minimum, the warlords who create chaos must repent and apologize to the people of the country, and in fact, they must absolutely abandon their warlord behavior, and all warlords must be made public to the party and the country. If there is no such heartfelt expression, it is not a true awakening or true repentance, but the ambition is still alive. The scourge is not removed, and the difficulties of Lu are not</p>
<p>gone. The warlords are still there, and peace is settled. The people of the whole country cannot help but pay attention. The warlords make their final speculation. After their failure, they often use the psychology of the whole country's desire for peace to seek survival and preserve their strength. Originally, after a long war, there will naturally be many powerful and prestigious people who cannot bear the suffering of the people and come out to advocate peace. Therefore, the troublemakers take this opportunity, as if once the slogan of peace is put forward, all the crimes of harming the country and the people are all not questioned or discussed. The national voice echoed, peace, peace. It is not the gospel of the people, but it has become the talisman for the warlords to be more cautious in times of danger. The various past events are really ridiculous and regrettable. You see, Yan Feng, who failed to create chaos, will advocate peace in the future. We learn from the past and avoid future mistakes. We only support the central government's policy of peaceful unification and support Deputy Commander Zhang's proposition of respecting unification and listening to the central government's placement. We certainly want peace, but we must carefully consider whether this kind of peace is reliable and whether there is a huge crisis lurking after peace. We cannot blindly accept that all peace is good. We never forget peace at all times, but at the same time, we must not forget unity, and we must not forget the unity that is necessary for the realization of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>Unification is not someone obeying someone, not a province obeying a province, how can it be the North obeying the South, or the South obeying the North. But the military, political, civil affairs, financial affairs of all provinces and regions...everything must obey the central government, and must follow the laws and decrees of the central government. The entire country does not allow anyone to divide it. The country's army, land, and financial resources do not allow anyone to take it as their own. We believe that none of the people of the whole country considers unification to be unfavorable and unwilling to unify. Even with Shanxi and Shaanxi, which were divided by Yan and Feng, may I ask, are the people of Shanxi and Shaanxi not Chinese? Do they only seek Shanxi's good and Shaanxi's good and not hope for China's good? Do the people of Shanxi and Shaanxi, who have a little knowledge, not understand that if Liaoning, the Northeast University Education College, visits the Shanghai Sanyou Industrial Company's newly produced "212" soft and free-spirited clothing for photography, the middle member of the first row is Professor Xie Xiangfan of the school, and the person on the right wearing "212" student uniform is Dr. Huang Jingwan, a business etiquette expert. Sanyou Company's "212" soft and free-spirited flannel, which is spun, dyed, and woven by itself, has a soft and firm texture and elegant colors. More than 50 varieties have been released, as a domestic substitute for imported flannel and serge. It is excellent for making men's and women's Chinese and Western-style clothing. There is a seven-day large price reduction during the National Goods Movement Week. The Nanshi Penglai Market store also holds the event at the same time. ▲ Today is the Double Tenth National Day, and the company will be closed for one day.</p>

<p>If China perishes, Shanxi and Shaanxi will never survive alone. As Chinese people, we naturally hope to have a unified country. But the Yan and Feng warlords want to use the lack of national intelligence to divide the boundaries between the North and the South and create all kinds of meaningless words. They thought that the central army's suppression of the rebellion was the South conquering the North, hoping to use the protection of the region to prolong the remnants of their warlord lives. However, they did not know that the central government is the central government of the whole country, not the central government of that side. What the central government wants to suppress is only the Yan and Feng warlords, not the people of that province or that side. This meaning is very clear. How can the people of the North be willing to be deceived by them?</p>
<p>We can say that peace is the result of the success of the revolution, not the means that the revolution must take. Unification is not the success of the revolution, but only the process that the revolution must go through. Therefore, we can understand more clearly that there must be unification before there can be peace. Peace cannot be realized without the meaning of unification. To talk about peace without unification is to seek temporary peace, to compromise, not to revolutionize, to give the warlords the opportunity to cultivate, and to sow endless evil causes for great chaos. People of the whole country, what you welcome most is peace, but what you should be most careful about is also peace. Since we recognize that China's environmental crisis cannot be saved without implementing the Three Principles of the People, and cannot be realized without the leadership of the Chinese Kuomintang, we must save the country's crisis. To implement the Three Principles of the People, we must first promote the country's unification. Therefore, the only way out for our compatriots across the country now is to revolutionize, to support the revolutionary central government, to eliminate the rebellious warlords, and to complete the country's unification. As we commemorate the Double Tenth Festival of the nineteenth year, we recall the achievements of the Xinhai Revolution, which were exchanged for the suffering of many people and the heads of many patriots, and were once mistaken for peace and compromise, and were easily given away. Since the Northern Expedition in the thirteenth year, I don't know how many comrades have sacrificed and how many people have suffered. Only then can we have today's situation. At this time when the remaining warlords are collapsing for the last time, we must not repeat the mistakes of the Xinhai Revolution, so that the major sacrifices of several years will turn into nothing. We love peace very much, and we can only eliminate the warlords who destroy peace with one heart and one mind. We should not listen to the warlords who destroy peace and make opportunistic moves without taking responsibility. Then the revolution can be successful as soon as possible, and the country's future will have good hope.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke on the Construction of the Foundation of Civil Governance</h3>
<p>Since the late Premier Sun first advocated for revolution, after more than twenty years of tireless efforts and over ten failures, the Wuchang Uprising of 1911 finally occurred, achieving the goal of overthrowing the imperial system and establishing the Republic of China. However, after the establishment of the Republic, remnants of the Qing court, as well as emerging warlords and politicians, arose one after another, successively stealing state power. From then on, internal warfare continued without a single year of peace, and the nation's fate became precarious, with the people's livelihoods even more destitute than in the late Qing period. Because the goal of revolution had not been achieved, the late Premier united comrades and continued to struggle, aiming to eliminate the remaining reactionary elements and establish a truly democratic nation. Thus, after more than ten years of renewed efforts, the Northern Expedition succeeded in 1928, unifying China. Unfortunately, the late Premier had already passed away and did not live to witness this grand occasion himself. However, his spirit in heaven should be somewhat comforted. At this time, our party comrades were all celebrating, and the people of the entire nation were filled with joy and excitement, eagerly anticipating the end of military operations and the beginning of political tutelage. Who would have expected that within two years, treacherous military personnel and rebellious party members would arise from within, causing unforeseen disasters? In order to quell the rebellions, the Central Government had no choice but to resort to arms again. During this time, the alliance of Yan, Feng, Zhang, and Gui launched an armed rebellion, bringing the reactionary forces to their peak. Fortunately, the Central Government employed various strategies of suppression and appeasement, and the officers and soldiers fought bravely. After several months of conquest, the united front of reactionary forces collapsed one after another. Now, the Northeast has dispatched troops and recovered Peiping and Tianjin. The mopping up of the remaining enemies in Shanxi and Henan is as easy as turning one's hand. We are fortunate to see peace again during the National Day holiday, which is truly cause for celebration. However, as the saying goes, "Remembering the past is a guide for the future." All of our citizens, having experienced pain, must have a thorough awakening. I have often considered why China failed to establish a solid civil government and implement the Three Principles of the People after the 1911 Revolution. Although this was due to the tyranny of the warlords and the disruption of the politicians, the root cause was the weakness of the foundation of civil governance and the deterioration of the social environment, which led to this situation. Therefore, to seek the permanent cessation of internal strife in China and the realization of the Three Principles of the People, we must establish the foundation of civil governance and cultivate the spirit of civil governance. Only then will the remaining reactionary elements have nowhere to take root, and the obstacles to revolution can be removed. Otherwise, treacherous and cunning individuals with various schemes will make a comeback, which is to be expected. At this time, when everything is being renewed and all undertakings are waiting to be revived, we must be practical and use unwavering spirit and perseverance to establish the foundation of civil governance in the new China. What is this foundation? First, a psychological foundation; second, a material foundation; and third, a political foundation. Once these three are in place, the goals of the national revolution can be realized, and the success of the Three Principles of the People can be expected.</p>
<p>What is the psychological foundation? The psychological foundation means that all citizens should be baptized by the Three Principles of the People. It is imperative that all citizens not only understand the meaning of the Three Principles of the People but also sincerely believe that the Three Principles of the People are the only strategy to save the nation. At the same time, they must have the determination to implement the Three Principles of the People. To achieve this goal, we must establish the Three Principles of the People as the central objective of national education and strive to implement this plan with utmost sincerity. Only then will the thoughts of the nation's youth not be misled into wandering and confusion. Once the beliefs of the nation's youth are firm, external incitement will not easily shake them in a passive sense, and in an active sense, faith will generate powerful capabilities. This capability is the driving force for promoting the ideology. Since our party unified China, we have nominally paid attention to this, but the actual effects have been minimal. The thoughts of the youth are complex and chaotic, no less than before. If this continues, the crisis will be extremely serious. This is the first thing that we should all work together to address.</p>
<p>Second is the construction of the material foundation. China is an industrially backward country, and the national economy and the people's livelihood are in dire straits. Coupled with natural disasters and man-made calamities, the number of displaced people is uncountable. These people, facing hunger and cold, either become bandits or join the military. Therefore, the increase in bandits and soldiers has become directly proportional. Recently, the Communists have been lurking and inciting people everywhere, gathering vagrants and spreading throughout the provinces, which is a serious threat to China. However, relying solely on military force to suppress them is difficult to eradicate them completely. The best method is to solve the people's livelihood problem. Therefore, we must, in the shortest possible time, develop agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce according to the late Premier's industrial plan. However, the development of industry and commerce begins with convenient transportation. Therefore, railways and highways are the most important tools for developing industry and commerce. Given China's vast territory and large population, the national railway network is only 7,000 miles long. On average, there is only one mile of railway for every 276 square miles or 55,000 people. Compared to any other country, this ratio is the smallest. How can we not be surprised that treasures cannot be developed and the national economy is in poverty? Therefore, the late Premier's plan for 100,000 miles of railways must be realized so that agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce can develop in turn, and the four basic needs of the people—clothing, food, housing, and transportation—can be fully met. As Guan Zhong said, "When clothing and food are sufficient, then ritual and righteousness will flourish." With a stable life, even if you want to drive the people to banditry, it will be impossible. How can there be any who would take the risk? This is the second thing that we should all work together to address.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is essential to establish a political foundation. Politics is for the people, not the people for politics. The purpose of politics is to seek the common welfare of the people of the whole country. However, past warlord governments not only failed to benefit the people and eliminate harm in a proactive way but also failed to guarantee social security in a passive way, only increasing the people's burdens and suffering. Our party's implementation of the National Revolution aims to make politics owned by the people, governed by the people, and enjoyed by the people. During this period of political tutelage, we must eradicate all the bad habits of officialdom and abolish all kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies. At the same time, we must implement the people's four rights as soon as possible so that the entire nation can have a fresh start. Only then can the people of the whole country feel the true significance of how the National Government differs from the era of the warlords. At the same time, they can gain a deep and clear understanding of our party's ideology and political program. If we cannot complete the work of political tutelage within the predetermined period, the people will inevitably think that the Three Principles of the People are nothing more than unredeemed banknotes. How can we explain ourselves then? This is the third thing that we should all work together to address.</p>
<p>The above three are the foundation of civil governance and the basic conditions for realizing the Three Principles of the People. Although the construction of these three foundations cannot be achieved overnight, if we can use the late Premier's unwavering spirit of perseverance to eradicate all hypocrisy and bad habits, then the path is not far away. This depends on whether our party comrades have determination and sincerity. Now that Yan, Feng, Zhang, and Gui have been successively eliminated, and the nation is returning to a unified period, the people of the whole country have infinite expectations for our party. May our party comrades rise up quickly and catch up to meet their expectations.</p>
<h3>Gao Boshi on Saving the Nation Through Commerce</h3>
<p>A Comparison of Military Warfare and Commercial Warfare</p>
<p>There are two reasons for war: one is power, and the other is profit. Or it impacts the foundation of national morality, which lies in loyalty and filial piety; the foundation of social morality, which lies in trustworthiness and righteousness; and the foundation of human morality, which lies in peace and benevolence. Unifying them all, the responsibility for cultivating such virtues lies entirely in education. Without good education, all construction will be impossible. After all, there must be people who can build before there can be a career to speak of. May those responsible for education strive together.</p>
<p>Written by Dai Chuanxian of the Shen Bao Office on the National Day of the Republic of China, 1930.</p>
<p>To charge into battle and determine victory or defeat on the battlefield is tangible warfare, called military warfare. To strategize and calculate and determine victory or defeat in the marketplace is intangible warfare, called commercial warfare. The means of military warfare and commercial warfare are different, but the purpose is the same—nothing more than to seek power and profit. In ancient times, military warfare was used. After winning a battle, land could be occupied at will, and children, women, and wealth could be taken as desired. However, the situation of killing filling the fields and blood flowing like rivers was inevitably too cruel. In modern warfare, commercial warfare is used, using "trade policies" to impoverish other countries and weaken their people. As a result, their land is occupied and their people are enslaved, without the name of military warfare but with the reality of military warfare. Furthermore, military warfare relies on temporary force and cannot be relied upon for long. Those who fail are also temporarily subdued and will seize opportunities to retaliate. The aftermath is unbearable. Commercial warfare methods are much more sophisticated. First, it absorbs money. Without money, nothing can be done. Second, countries like England use "opium" as a commodity to sell to China, luring the Chinese to smoke "opium," leading to racial decline and the complete loss of resistance. Once a country is destroyed,</p>
<p>there is no possibility of national restoration. Therefore, the harm of commercial warfare is even more serious than military warfare.</p>
<p>A Comparison of Commerce with Agriculture, Industry, and Mining</p>
<p>In addition to agriculture, industry, and mining, there is also commerce as a production industry in a country. Why is commerce considered a production industry? Because the elements of production are nothing more than increasing utility. It is not necessary to create materials. Workers manufacture, but they only change the shape of things. Merchants, by selling goods, increase the utility of the goods. Its importance is no less than that of industry, and even less than that of agriculture and mining. The comparison is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) A Comparison of Commerce and Agriculture: Agricultural products are raw materials, but the transportation and sale of raw materials cannot be done without merchants. Otherwise, on the one hand, there will be a surplus of agricultural products, and farmers will not be able to obtain payment to maintain their livelihoods; on the other hand, there will be a shortage of raw materials, and workers will not be able to make utensils for public use. Social panic will immediately appear. Therefore, the importance of commerce is no less than that of agriculture.</p>
<p>(2) A Comparison of Commerce and Industry: Industrialists manufacture. The</p>
<p>purpose of manufacturing is to sell. The larger the sales, the more manufacturing there is, and then industry will develop. If sales are poor and products are surplus, industry cannot avoid decline. Therefore, the importance of commerce is no less than that of industry.</p>
<p>(3) A Comparison of Commerce and Mining: There are two purposes for mining. The subjective purpose is to make a profit, and the objective purpose is to supply civilian use. If there are no merchants to sell it directly or indirectly, both purposes cannot be achieved. Therefore, the importance of commerce is no less than that of mining.</p>
<p>More Examples as Proof</p>
<p>1. England is the world's leading commercial country. Because the English are good at business, the British flag, following the power of British merchants, is planted overseas. Therefore, England has become the world's largest</p>
<p>powerful country.</p>
<p>2. Germany is the world's leading industrial country. Its manufactured goods</p>
<p>Although it has always been known for its excellence, if there were no merchants to promote it overseas, the scope of industry would inevitably shrink due to the small domestic demand. Therefore, Germany now has such a developed industry, and it should also be attributed to merchants.</p>
<p>3. The United States is the world's leading agricultural country. Because of the efforts of American merchants, various countries in Europe and Asia have become major customers of American goods. The United States has this good opportunity, so production does not worry about being surplus. The maximum expansion and promotion has made it the world's richest country.</p>
<p>4. Taking China as an example. China's mineral wealth has long been recognized by the world. However, because commerce is not developed, the mining industry cannot be revitalized.</p>
<p>Speaking of China, it not only has abundant mineral resources, but also in terms of industry and agriculture. The emergence of Chinese industry was originally very early, and it has always been based on agriculture. It is only because the emperors of the past did not value commerce and did not know that commerce is the soul of industry, agriculture, and mining, that it has allowed foreign commerce to take the upper hand. Chinese merchants, under heavy oppression, have no way to extricate themselves. And the industry, agriculture, and mining industries are all unable to catch up with other countries. "A wrong move loses the whole game." Chinese people's "contempt for commerce" mentality should now be fully aware.</p>
<p>Reasons for China's Commercial Failure</p>
<p>(1) Reasons for Financial Failure: The financial activity of a country is closely related to the development of commerce. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said, "Chinese people are all poor... The biggest capitalists in China are just small paupers compared to foreign capitalists. The other poor people can be said to be big paupers." - The Second Lecture on the Principle of Livelihood - Trading with foreigners with the poverty of the Chinese, and the big capital oppressing the small capital, the failure of commerce is undoubted. But how to prove that the Chinese are poor? We can average the wealth of various countries. The United States has 6,607 yuan per person, the United Kingdom has 5,247 yuan per person, France has 2,549 yuan per person, Japan has 1,721 yuan per person, Germany has 1,141 yuan per person, Italy has 1,117 yuan per person, Russia has 756 yuan per person, and China has only 101 yuan per person.</p>
<p>(2) Reasons for Industrial Failure: China's mechanized factories were still in the Qing Guangxu era. But because of one, China has no big capitalists. Two, the Chinese are not good at using shared resources. ) - Company organization. So the progress of industry is extremely slow. Until now. Still no effect can be seen. Speaking only of the cotton industry, the production capacity of the cotton industry, calculated by the number of spindles, the ratio of each spindle to the population. The United Kingdom is 0.7. The United States is 1.5. Czechoslovakia is 3.9. France is 4.1. Germany is 6.3. Italy is 8.1. Japan is 14.5. Russia is 18.2. India is 37. China is 197. The difference in industrial level is like this.</p>
<p>(3) Reasons for Transportation Failure: Mr. Sun Yat-sen originally had a plan to build 100,000 miles of railways and 1 million miles of macadam roads to develop China's transportation. But now the railway. Only about 7,000 miles have been completed. Compared with other countries, the ratio of railways to area in various countries. Every 1 mile of railway. The United Kingdom is 5 square miles. The Netherlands is 6 square miles. France is 8 square miles. The United States is 11 square miles. Japan is 25 square miles. China is as much as 220 square miles. Speaking again of shipping. In China, China only accounts for 18%. In ocean shipping. China only accounts for four thousandths. The difference in level is even greater.</p>
<p>(4) Reasons for Donation Tax Failure: In the country, there are two points that must be noted. One, do not hurt business. Two, not to</p>
<p>disturb the people. China's Likin (internal transit tax) is originally a compound tax. The Likin bureau is poorly managed. Demand is left behind. Harmful to business and disturbing the people. In addition to Likin. Local governments are more cleverly creating names. Complicated and heavy donations. Emerging in endlessly. Hindering the development of industry and commerce. Affecting the national economy and the people's livelihood. The National Government was established. The call to abolish exorbitant taxes and levies has spread throughout the country. recently. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has a "plan to abolish exorbitant taxes and levies". And the day of cutting Likin is also not far away. If it can be implemented one by one. China's industry and commerce. There is hope for development.</p>
<p>(5) Reasons for Monetary Failure: The chaos of China's currency is a rare phenomenon in the world. The damage in the past is not worth mentioning. recently. Gold is expensive and silver is cheap. China is a "silver standard" country. The payment of foreign debt interest. The payment for foreign trade. and the various losses in foreign exchange calculations. The amount is even greater. The Ministry of Finance has recently realized the need to reform the currency system. But the implementation of the "gold standard" is still far away and is a major obstacle to the development of commerce.</p>
<p>In addition to the above five reasons. There are also domestic merchants. There is a conservative ideology. No insight into development. The government is for commerce. Without full protection. Without adequate equipment. International. There are also unequal treaty constraints. And the arrogance of foreign merchants. Are also important reasons for the failure of my country's commerce.</p>
<p>Plan to Develop Chinese Commerce</p>
<p>1. Internal planning. First, donations and taxes should be reduced appropriately. To reduce the cost of production. The burden on merchants. Second, the currency should be actively reorganized. Achieve unification. To facilitate calculation and transmission. Third, traffic should be actively expanded. To facilitate the coming and going of merchants and travelers. The transportation of goods. Fourth, industry should be distinguished between private and state-owned. Actively develop each one. To meet national needs internally. Serve the needs of the world externally. Expand commerce to the world. 5. We should find ways to increase revenue and raise large amounts of funds. For the construction of everything. For the development of everything.</p>
<p>2. External planning. First, all unequal treaties should be abolished. And take back all foreign power bases in China. Such as concessions and leased territories. Second, China should have its own shipping routes. Find your own business in overseas markets. Third, China should establish trade agencies overseas. And various trade support agencies.</p>
<p>Developing Commerce Can Save the Country</p>
<p>Today's China. You can count the poverty and weakness. Where is the poverty? Because of foreign trade. Years of trade deficits. Native money. Years of outflow. Outflowing to now. How can China not be poor. Where is the weakness? Because the people of the whole country. Suffered from the poison of the "foolish people policy" in the autocratic era. The psychology of the people. Only focus on being an official. Don't focus on doing business. Most of the people who become officials are corrupt. Harsh taxes hurt business. Also prohibit people from consulting state affairs. The so-called "people can be made to follow it. Can't make peace with it." Until the people have no power to defend the country. The country has no power to defend the people. When foreign insults come. Surrender and accept control. Loss of rights and loss of power. Disaster for the people and humiliation for the country. Past failures of various kinds. Can be used as a lesson from the past. From now on. If we can work hard to develop commerce. Then first, we can reverse the downward trend of foreign trade surpluses. In order to avoid the outflow of money. Second, internally, we can expand commercial power. Externally, it can develop national power. Commercial power expands. Commercial evils will disappear. National strength develops. Foreign insults will not come. In addition, the increase in exports of domestic goods. Naturally, it is not difficult to turn poverty into wealth. Turning weakness into strength.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Looking at it from various aspects. China's commerce. There is now a chance of survival. Where is the chance of survival? It is the success of the National Revolution. The implementation of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ideology. The opening of the merchant class. Merchants can use their inherent power. Connecting the people of the whole country. Direct national salvation movement. Also because the National Government began the construction of the whole country. In accordance with "Mr. Sun Yat-sen's will." Abolish unequal treaties. Recovered various lost privileges from foreigners. They all have a negative impact on the commerce of various countries. Give China's commerce a chance to develop. Therefore, Chinese merchants. To step up efforts. Develop China's commerce. Eliminate all the forces of various countries in China under the "commercial policy". In order to complete the "national salvation" work.</p>

<p>National Day Essay Two</p>
<h3>Peace and Hu Hanmin</h3>
<p>"Peace, Struggle, Save China"</p>
<p>As the National Day returns and military matters are settled, we recall the Premier's last words, which seem especially profound and significant today.</p>
<p>We must achieve genuine and lasting peace in China to fulfill the mission of saving China. Saving China is the purpose of the National Revolution. To achieve this purpose, we must rely on struggle.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why China has been in chaos and disorder to this day, why it has been unable to achieve genuine and lasting peace. But the most obvious and easily recognizable factors are the oppression and encroachment of imperialism from without and the separatist warlordism and rebellion from within. These two anti-peace forces collude and create inequality in China's international, political, and economic status.</p>
<p>Under these accumulated circumstances of external aggression and internal troubles, to seek genuine and lasting peace for China and to fulfill the mission of saving China, it is essential not to compromise with warlords and not to compromise with imperialism. We must remove these two major obstacles to peace to achieve equality in international, political, and economic status for the Chinese nation. Only by eliminating the warlords and abolishing the unequal treaties by which imperialism binds China can we enter the gateway of genuine and lasting peace. Only by achieving equality in national, political, and economic status can we reach the inner sanctum of genuine peace. Otherwise, if we seek genuine and lasting peace by compromising with warlords without eliminating them, and if we seek genuine and lasting peace by compromising with imperialism without abolishing the unequal treaties, it would not only be a mistake but simply a delusion. We should know that the foundation of peace lies in breaking down the obstacles to peace. If the obstacles are not removed but we seek to gloss over them, it is complacency, not peace.</p>
<p>This principle should be simple and easy to understand. However, the reality is often not so. As we are making efforts to eliminate the remaining forces of reactionary warlords internally and to recover all sovereign rights externally, in order to implement construction and lead China onto the path of genuine and lasting peace, ordinary people, especially some so-called intellectuals, are eager for immediate peace. They say, "Immediate peace is our only way out today." No matter how great the price of peace, it is always cheaper than war. This is indeed true, but precisely because of this, we must strive for genuine and lasting peace and must not seek temporary complacency. Because the desire to end war and achieve peace is shared by all of us, we must deeply examine the authenticity and duration of peace. Is the immediate peace that ordinary people desire at present genuine or false, permanent or temporary? I dare to say firmly that if we cannot fundamentally eradicate the roots of feudal forces and the privileges of imperialism, genuine and lasting peace will never come. In other words, it is not that peace is unimaginable, but that peace is impossible. The Premier said it most clearly in his declaration at the First National Congress:</p>
<p>"The cause of China's wars is the warlords who stand against each other. These warlords each care for their own interests, and their contradictions are extreme, making reconciliation impossible. Even if possible, it would only be a reconciliation of interests among the warlords, and it would not benefit the people at all. This is merely a union of warlords, not the unification of the nation. What need do the people have for this? As for those who know that reconciliation is impossible and only hope to maintain a balance of power among the factions so that they do not clash and to maintain temporary stability, that is even more of a pipe dream. How can one prevent the warlords from attacking each other? Moreover, all warlords possess armies, and the result cannot but be war and plunder. It is easier to plunder neighboring provinces than one's own."</p>
<p>Therefore, it is impossible to seek temporary stability without eliminating the warlords, because the interests of the warlords who stand against each other are extremely contradictory, and even reconciliation is impossible. Even if there is temporary reconciliation, it is impossible to prevent the warlords from engaging in mutual warfare and plunder. This makes even temporary stability impossible. The events of the past three years have proven that the Premier's reasoning is immutable. For the past three years, the policy held by the Central Government has been to achieve peace. We deeply know that without peace, we cannot restore the vitality of society and give the people a chance to recuperate and thrive. Without peace, we cannot strengthen the nation's power and promote the construction of the revolution. Therefore, we advocate disbandment to establish a national army and reform the psychology of soldiers. But in fact, because we have compromised too much with some remaining warlords who have not changed their ways, the implementation of disbandment has been obstructed. From Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi to the current Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang, all have not changed their feudal separatist psychology, are unwilling to accept disbandment, and have recklessly started wars, plotting to overthrow the Central Government, each seeking to achieve their own selfish ambitions. From this, we can see that the law in physics that "two different objects cannot occupy the same time and space" can be translated into a revolutionary point of view, which is that counter-revolutionary forces and revolutionary forces cannot coexist at the same time and place. If they coexist, they will repel each other and eventually fight, breaking peace. This truth is immutable.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that what we demand is not temporary and superficial peace, but genuine and lasting peace obtained after removing all obstacles to peace. In the past and even up to last month, the Central Government has been making efforts toward this goal, both in suppressing rebellion and in pursuing construction. To put it plainly, it is precisely because there are rebellious troops who destroy peace and start wars that we must suppress the insurgents and quell internal unrest. This is not warmongering, but a necessary means to safeguard and achieve peace. Because if a central government with a revolutionary mission cannot stop or prevent chaos in advance, nor quell it afterward, to maintain the policies it has established and implemented, and to seek freedom and equality for the nation and the people, the result will inevitably lead to the disintegration of the nation and the people into eternal ruin. This would not only be impossible for the central government with a revolutionary mission to explain to itself, but also impossible for it to survive.</p>
<p>In his northern declaration in 1924, the Premier clearly stated, "In the thirteen years, there has been metabolism among the warlords themselves, but their nature and function, from Yuan Shikai to Cao Kun, are exactly the same. Therefore, the purpose of the Northern Expedition is not only to destroy Cao and Wu, but also to ensure that no one like them rises again after Cao and Wu are destroyed... Only in this way can the purpose of the National Revolution be vigorously carried out by removing obstacles." This passage is sufficient to confirm our above arguments. After Cao and Wu are destroyed, it is unacceptable for someone like them to rise again, according to the Premier. Then, it is naturally even more unacceptable for Cao and Wu themselves to rise again. But now, some so-called intellectuals, when the warlords who are equivalent to Cao and Wu are about to be destroyed, do not think about fundamentally removing the obstacles to peace, but hope for false and temporary peace. How strange is this? Indeed, if peace could be achieved, why wouldn't the Central Government, whose sole policy is to achieve peace, be happy to do so? But this kind of peace is like Zhao Meng stealing food, only lasting until the morning, an impossible peace. Even if it is achieved by chance, it is not what the people need. We comrades and compatriots must carefully consider these points.</p>
<p>Extrapolating from this to the current situation, we should recognize that we cannot talk about peace with those who have already rebelled, nor can we talk about peace with those who have incited rebellion. Those who have rebelled, because they have been defeated and exhausted, suddenly reverse their previous attitude and seek peace. But what is their purpose? Needless to say, it is to wait for the strength they lost in the war to recover to a considerable extent, and then rebel again. If we seek peace with such people, or even grant them peace, the result will be endless internal strife, and the losses suffered by the people will inevitably be greater, and the suffering will inevitably be deeper. This is very obvious. Secondly, why can't we talk about peace with those who have incited rebellion? Because all those who incite rebellion must be a group of shameless bureaucrats and politicians, and even unprincipled party members such as Wang Jingwei. These people have no shame, no integrity. When they see that those on whom they rely to survive and rebel are about to collapse, they are already panic-stricken and have no choice but to chant false peace slogans to tide over the current crisis and then slowly seek to achieve their own desires. If we talk about peace with such people, or even be deceived by them and grant them peace, the harm will be immeasurable.</p>
<p>Our conclusion is that to achieve genuine and lasting peace, the only correct path is: First, to remove obstacles to peace. The so-called obstacles are the remaining warlords and the privileges that imperialism has not completely withdrawn. Second, to strive to realize the practical construction of the Three Principles of the People established by the Premier. These two steps must be carried out in tandem in order to achieve the genuine and lasting peace we seek, which is also the only way the Premier instructed us to "save China." Only by building the Three Principles of the People can we have the genuine content of "peace" and "saving China," because only this principle can make the nation's status equal, the political status equal, and the economic status equal. We must strive to achieve equality in national status, so we must abolish all unequal treaties to obtain the independence and freedom that our nation deserves. We must strive to achieve equality in political status, so we must eliminate feudal warlord oligarchic politics and implement local autonomy to extend the power of the people. We must strive to achieve equality in economic status, so we must develop transportation, define production organizations, and support the development of various social industries to alleviate the people's poverty. All of this is to seek genuine and lasting peace for the entire nation and all the people, not to seek temporary stability with warlords and imperialists. Simply put, when the people of the whole country have a livelihood, have the power of autonomy, and have the freedom to develop the nation upward, then genuine and lasting peace is among them. This is "peace" and "saving China." We must "struggle" towards this great path with national unity.</p>

<h3>Central Executive Committee Decides to Hold Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Scheduled for November 12th</p>
<p>Hu Hanmin's Opinion on the National Assembly</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, the Central Standing Committee decided to hold the Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Executive Committee on November 12th. (Special Dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Hu Hanmin expressed his opinion on the convocation of the National Assembly, saying that since the Premier went north in 1924 and advocated the convocation of the National Assembly, its purpose was to solicit the opinions of the people of the whole country, to eliminate warlords internally and to overthrow imperialism externally. After the Premier passed away, the comrades in Guangdong continued to promote the work of the National Assembly, but they were unable to realize it because of the obstruction of the warlords. In the autumn of the year before last, after the military was roughly settled, the Central Government wanted to initiate the convocation again, but it was still constrained by the warlords, so it first held a disbandment conference. Unexpectedly, the ambitious warlords of all parties betrayed and rebelled because of this, causing the people to suffer great pain. Where else could there be room for the people to hold meetings? Then a group of useless politicians who helped the chaos suddenly used the slogan of the National Assembly as a tool to deceive themselves and others, which is like issuing bad checks, is it not extremely ridiculous? The National Assembly should be convened, and whether we have the relevant sincerity and possibility are two separate matters. If it is still a collection of warlords, politicians, and outdated elements who manipulate things, it can only be called a meeting of vagrants and cannot be called a National Assembly. (Special Dispatch on the 9th)</p>

This meeting has important domestic and foreign implications. (Electric Communication Agency Dispatch on the 9th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>National Day Commemoration and the World</h3>
<p>Why do we have a National Day commemoration? To overthrow the corrupt old politics of the Qing Dynasty and establish the Republic of China. Why did we overthrow the corrupt old politics of the Qing Dynasty to establish the Republic of China? Because we wanted to conform to the trend of the world and compete for survival in the world. Therefore, to commemorate National Day, we must always understand the situation of the world. The world's situation is constantly changing. Those who want to compete for survival in this world must also constantly investigate and study. We must adopt and implement the good laws and beautiful governance of the world, and prevent and avoid the crises and bad customs of the world. We must remove the evils of the world and use its good to make the Republic of China the best country in the world. This is what we should pay attention to every year on National Day.</p>
<p>Every nation hopes for its prosperity and permanence. The Republic of China, in terms of material and political aspects, is originally a culturally backward country in the world. However, sometimes it is also because of its backwardness that its evils are later than others. It is up to the Chinese people to be more careful in choosing what to take and what to discard in the trends of the world. Now that the military affairs are over and we are about to embark on the road of construction, I would like to mention this on the National Day commemoration.</p>

<h3>Agricultural Extension Plan</h3>
<p>Ministry of Agriculture to Implement</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Agriculture and Mining has drafted a plan to implement agricultural extension nationwide. The principles are: 1. Guide and assist farmers, and develop their self-help and self-reliance capabilities. 2. In addition to imparting new scientific knowledge to farmers, all good farming experiences that already exist in the country should also be promoted. 3. Apply the least amount of money, the lowest number of personnel, and the most appropriate methods to achieve the greatest results. 4. In addition to guiding and assisting adult farmers, children's agricultural groups should be organized for rural children to educate them, and appropriate guidance should also be given to farm women. 5. Relevant agencies and organizations, such as agricultural organizations, agricultural supplementary schools, and rural primary schools, should be in close contact and cooperate with agricultural extension agencies to be effective. The extension period will be divided into four phases for each province in the country, to be completed within twenty years. If a province has considerable agricultural research and experimental institutions, a provincial agricultural experiment station should be established. The establishment period will be the first phase, and each province should begin to establish it immediately after the announcement of this plan; the second phase should be established before the third year; the third phase should be established before the sixth year; and the fourth phase should be established before the tenth year. The sources of funding are: 1. Subsidies from the central government, such as appropriate allocation of income from investment of the Boxer Indemnity, and customs duties, etc. 2. Provincial funds. 3. County and local funds. 4. Subsidies from local organizations and others. (9th Daily Telegram)</p>

<h3>British Imperial Conference Holds Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Discussing Imperial Economic Matters</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th - The Imperial Conference held a plenary session today to discuss imperial economic matters. Dominions Secretary Thomas said that, on the whole, British Empire trade has developed as much as trade with other countries. In some respects, British trade has declined, partly because the Dominions have developed their own industries. Britain relies almost entirely on foreign countries for its food and raw materials. If Britain cannot maintain its standard of living, it will not be able to purchase as much from the Dominions. Britain appreciates the preferential treatment given by the Dominions, but hopes that the Dominions will not forget the value of imperial ties. There is now an economic paradox of overproduction. The world produces too much wheat, but people suffer from hunger; too much cotton is grown, but people have no clothes. In fact, the world has a common cause, and everyone should contribute to it. If people understand this, the problem can be solved easily. Australian Prime Minister Scullin said that Australia's policy is to encourage Australian manufacturing and then help British industry obtain the majority of import trade within the empire. He very much wants to see British and Australian industrialists consult with each other to determine satisfactory adjustment measures. New Zealand Prime Minister Forbes said that preferential tariffs are the most effective way to increase trade between the empires. Canadian Prime Minister Bennett said that all members of the British Empire should agree to the principle of imperial preference and implement it quickly. He believes that imperial free trade is neither desirable nor possible. He advocates setting up committees in each relevant country. Indian representative Coates said that India is prepared to consider in good faith various plans to encourage trade between the members of the British Empire, but is not prepared to abandon its current discriminatory protection policy, so India cannot be bound by the imperial tariff preference plan, but must retain complete freedom to respond at any time. Irish Free State Foreign Minister McGilligan said that when negotiating commercial agreements in the future, both New Zealand and India will see that the Irish Free State gives them the full benefits of preferential tariffs on their exports, but they have not given the Irish Free State any benefits on its products.</p>
<h3>Rift in Relations Between Russia and Finland</h3>
<p>Regarding Finland's Anti-Communist Movement</p>
<p>The Russian Government Protests Again in a Diplomatic Note</p>
<p>National News, Moscow, 8th - Soviet Russia and Finland have long not been very friendly. Since the Lapua Movement, relations between the two countries have become increasingly tense. Recently, the Russian government sent another diplomatic note to Finland, with rather strong language. Regarding the expulsion of communists from the country, it believes that the Finnish government's reply contains many evasive words and is not satisfactory. It also stated bluntly that if the Finnish government does not change its past attitude and continues to take actions that infringe on sovereignty on the border, the Russian government will regard it as clear evidence that Finland does not intend to maintain friendship with Soviet Russia.</p>

Therefore, the captured commander has telegraphed the president to resign.</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, 8th - The "Vossische Zeitung"'s London correspondent reports that news of revolutionary movements in South American countries has caused great panic in London, and it is believed that the unrest in various places there is at least partly sponsored by American financial and political circles, in the hope of hindering Britain's attempt to regain the world's leading economic position. In recent days, the public bonds of South America, which are the most reliable, have also fallen sharply on the London Stock Exchange.</p>

<h3>Increase in Number of Unemployed in Britain and Italy</h3>
<p>Pacific News, London, 8th - There are a total of 2,161,689 unemployed people in Britain. At this time last year, there were only 979,827 people.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th - Minister of Agriculture Addis gave a speech at the Labor Party Congress today, elaborating on the meaning of Prime Minister MacDonald's statement that the government's most important task is to settle the people on the land. He said that the government intends to seek the right to obtain land and organize committees to ensure that unemployed people have the opportunity to cultivate land. The government also plans to set up model farms throughout the country.</p>
<p>Pacific News, Rome, 8th - As of September 30, the number of unemployed people in Italy totaled 375,000, an increase of 33,000 compared to last month.

<h3>Japan Stops 200,000 Tons of Ships</h3>
<p>Forty-Two Ships Over a Thousand Tons</p>
<p>The World Press reports that the business of the Japanese shipping industry continues to be sluggish, and the number of ships that have stopped operations has increased significantly. According to a survey by the Japanese Ministry of Communications' Ship Management Bureau, in major ports alone, it has exceeded 200,000 tons in mid-September. Among them, there are as many as 42 ships over 1,000 tons, including the Tianjin Maru.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 9th - Nippon Yusen Kaisha has stopped operating twelve ships since this summer, and will stop operating four more ships in January next year. As a result, more than 1,000 senior and ordinary crew members on all routes have been decided to be laid off. The company authorities have already begun to reorganize. At the same time, regarding the issue of severance pay, they are requesting understanding from the Seamen's Union. In addition, land-based employees will also be decisively dismissed.</p>
<h3>Sharp Decline in Japanese Overseas Immigration</h3>
<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 9th - Although the Ministry of Colonial Affairs is committed to protecting and encouraging overseas immigration, the number of immigrants this year, from April to the end of September, receiving subsidies was only 6,702, and those paying their own expenses were only 293, totaling 6,995, a sharp decrease of 4,000 compared to the same period last year. The reason for the sharp decline is that it is difficult to raise travel expenses due to the economic downturn. From the perspective of unemployment countermeasures and population and food problem countermeasures, it is necessary to urgently seek remedies, but without a recovery in the financial world, it may still be difficult to do anything.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Rubber and Tin Trading in Singapore</h3>
<p>Significant Shortfall in Tax Revenue</p>

The new tax will now be implemented. The authorities plan to spend 20 million yuan on public works to reduce unemployment.</p>

<p>Hankou Quick Report: After Feng's army withdrew from Zhengzhou on the 5th, the various units of the Central Army completely occupied Zhengzhou on the 6th. Commander-in-Chief Chiang entered Zhengzhou on the 7th. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Process of Recovering Zhengzhou: After the Central Army recovered the important locations of Lanfeng, Kaifeng, Xuchang, Changge, and Xinzheng on the Longhai and Pinghan Railways, Feng's army retreated to the vicinity of Zhengzhou, attempting to use the city as a last resort. However, their main forces, Zhang Weixi, Tian Jinkai, Ren Yingqi, Deng Baoshan, Feng Zhi'an, and others, were surrounded between Suogang and Tuqiaozhai, northwest of Xinzheng. Deng Baoshan's troops have been disarmed. Liang Guanying's troops are negotiating surrender. Feng's army in Zhengzhou was exhausted and retreated from Zhengzhou on the evening of the 5th, fleeing to Hebei in two directions. Chen Cheng's 11th Division and Hao Mengling's 54th Division of the Second Column of the Central Army occupied Zhengzhou at 9:00 PM on July 7th.</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Chiang Arrives in Zhengzhou: Commander-in-Chief Chiang entered Kaifeng on the 6th. Upon receiving the telegram that Zhengzhou had been recovered, he took the General Headquarters' train on the 7th with Shao Lizi, Zhou Fohai, and others and arrived in Zhengzhou. He ordered Chen Cheng's division to cross the river in pursuit of the fleeing enemy. Other troops were stationed in Zhengzhou, while others returned south to suppress bandits, and others moved west along the Longhai Line to assist Yang Hucheng's troops in attacking Luoyang. After receiving the order, Chen Cheng's troops departed from northern Zhengzhou on the morning of the 8th and entered Rongze at noon, preparing to cross the river. Feng's retreating troops concentrated in the ZhanDian and Kangcun areas on the north bank of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>Xia Douyin and Others Return in Triumph: Now that Zhengzhou has been captured and the situation in Henan is about to be resolved, Chiang specially approved Bao Chengjun's request to recall the divisions of Xia Douyin, Xu Yuanquan, and Xiao Zhichu to suppress bandits in the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. He also ordered the divisions of Tan Daoyuan and Xu Kexiang, as well as the First Aviation Squadron, to return in triumph to await orders. With the exception of Xu and Xiao's divisions, which still need to stay for a short time, Xia Douyin's troops have concentrated in Xuchang and began transportation on the 8th. Xia led the 13th Division Commander Zhu Xinhuai Bing, Brigade Commander Wan Yaohuang, and others from Xuchang on the first train on the 8th and is expected to arrive in Wuhan on the afternoon of the 9th. The First Aviation Squadron arrived with six aircraft on the 8th, and squadron leader Zhang Yougu led the entire squadron to the south. As for Tan Daoyuan's division, it has concentrated in Zhongmou and will come to Wuhan via the Pinghan Railway within days. Xu Kexiang's division will concentrate in Pukou.</p>
<p>He Yingqin Goes to Zhengzhou: He Yingqin, Director of the Wuhan Headquarters, flew to Nanchang on the Kessle aircraft on the 5th for inspection. After negotiating a bandit suppression plan with Lu Diping, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, he decided to fly to the front to meet Chiang.

After receiving the order, He took the Douglas aircraft piloted by aviator Jiang Zhijian on the morning of the 8th and flew north, arriving in Luohe at noon. He changed planes to Zhengzhou and arrived in the afternoon. He participated in a military conference that evening and will return to Wuhan on the original plane within days.</p>
<p>The Henan Post-War Problem: Henan Province has been ravaged by war for a long time, and the disaster area is extremely large. The post-war problem is extremely important. Previously, because the provincial government's office was within the scope of Feng's army in Kaifeng, it only set up an office in Xinyang. After Zhengzhou was recovered, the National Government issued an order to reorganize the Henan Provincial Government, appointing Liu Zhi as Chairman, and Zhang Fang, Liu Maoen, Wan Wu, Zhang Feiran, Liu Jixue, Liu Yaoyang, and others as members and concurrently as department chiefs. It is reported that Liu Zhi plans to temporarily set up the provincial government in Zhengzhou, and then move to Bian after the military situation is completely settled. As for relieving the disaster victims in the war zone, Liu also believes that it is an urgent matter, and will immediately find ways to provide relief and will telegraph the Central Government to provide relief. The isolated geese after the disaster may have a glimmer of hope. (October 8)</p>

The guests and hosts were extremely cordial. After the new department directors took over, they issued proclamations of taking office, all stating that they had been commissioned by Zhang, the Commander of the Northeast Border Defense Army. The situation of the takeover is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Civil Affairs Department: The Civil Affairs Department was taken over by Construction Department Director Lin Xiu. Lin arrived at the department at 10:00 AM on the 4th. Secretary Jiang Xizeng and others received him separately. According to Lin's talk to the staff of the Civil Affairs Department, Director Wang will arrive in Tianjin to take office within days. He himself is only responsible for the takeover, so he has not changed any of the old staff.</p>
<p>Finance Department: Finance Department Director Yao Hong went to the Finance Department at 8:00 AM on the 4th with Secretary Wu E to take over. Old Secretary Xiao, Director Su Xin, and others received him. He appointed Zuo Yunkui as the Section Chief of the First Section, temporarily acting as the Section Chief of the Third Section, Zhang Xueyuan as the Section Chief of the Second Section, and Shen Yunchang as the Section Chief of the Fourth Section. He retained Sun Shou Kang, Zhu Bangjing, Gan Shangren, Dai Yulin, Ruan Jiaju, Wu Zhu, Wu Hui, Yang Fenglai, Chen Ji, Li Futian, Li Yuding, Shi Heqing, and other twelve people to work in the department, and each supervisor retained a few people to keep the files and await further appointment. The files of each section were taken over, and a proclamation of taking office was issued.</p>
<p>Construction Department: After Construction Department Director Lin Chengxiu took over the Civil Affairs Department, he went to the Construction Department to take over. Sun Pikang, the Section Chief of the First Section of the Construction Department, was responsible for the handover. After Lin took over the seal, he posted a notice of taking office. He summoned all the staff in the conference room of the department and said that he always takes talent as the principle of employing people. If everyone has excellent results, they will continue to be relied on. However, due to financial relations, layoffs are inevitable. He hopes for understanding. The takeover matters are most likely to cause misunderstandings. Please hand over the information with peace of mind. He will never be picky.</p>
<p>Industry and Commerce Department: The Industry and Commerce Department was taken over by Agriculture and Mining Department Director Chang Bingyi. Chang arrived at the department at around 10:00 AM on the 4th. Because the former Director Li Hongwen was not present, Secretary Director Ji Huan'en was responsible for the handover. According to Chang's talk to the staff of the Industry and Commerce Department, the new Director He Yufang is currently on leave for five days due to business. Chairman Wang is deeply concerned that government affairs will be suspended, so he ordered him to take over on his behalf. The duties of the Industry and Commerce Department will still be carried out by the old staff.</p>
<p>Agriculture and Mining Department: After Chang Bingyi took over the Industry and Commerce Department, he went to the Agriculture and Mining Department to take over. Secretary Director Liu Wenhan and others of the department received him separately. The former Director Li Jingrong also held a banquet in the department to welcome him. Chang did not change the section chiefs of the first, second, and third sections of the department. It is reported that only the Chief Secretary Zhang Jiying, Secretary Wang Jin, and Section Chief of the Fourth Section Li Shufan will be changed.</p>
<p>Secretariat: Luo Chengwei, who is responsible for taking over the provincial government secretariat, came to Peiping at 11:00 AM on the 4th with Li Zhizheng, who was sent by the provincial government the day before yesterday to deliver the seals. After getting off the car, he went straight to the provincial government. According to Luo, the secretary-general of the provincial government has not yet been determined, so he is only here to take over on behalf of the secretary-general. After the takeover is completed, the provincial government will move to Tianjin. Chairman Wang will also employ the old staff according to their abilities. He also said that Wang Shuchang will not come to Peiping for the time being. The takeover began at about 4:00 PM and is expected to be completed in three or four days.</p>
<p>The Peiping Banking Association held a board meeting yesterday afternoon, the 4th. The chairman temporarily proposed that, because there is talk of the Hebei Provincial Government moving to Tianjin, the authorities should be requested to postpone the transfer of the provincial government. It was unanimously passed and a telegram was sent. The original text is copied as follows: "Commander Zhang of Liaoning, Chairman Wang of the Hebei Provincial Government in Tianjin, Yesterday's news reported that the Hebei Provincial Government is considering moving to Tianjin. Today's news reported that the Chairman and Directors of the Hebei Provincial Government took office in Tianjin. Peiping and Tianjin are close to each other. Peiping has suffered from the southward relocation of the capital, and many citizens are unemployed. In the past, there was the move of the Hebei Provincial Government to Peiping to seek prosperity. Although development still needs to be waited for, the benefits are quite considerable. Moreover, the Peiping-Suiyuan, Peiping-Hankou, and Peiping-Liaoning Railways are concentrated in Peiping, and transportation is convenient, which is enough to control the entire province. In addition, the ancient relics of the Forbidden City and educational institutions are gathered here. It is also easier for the provincial government to supervise nearby. Therefore, the relocation of the Hebei Provincial Government to Peiping is not only to seek prosperity for Peiping, but also to be more convenient in terms of the overall situation of the province. You care about the people's livelihood and are all-encompassing. This time, the relocation of the Hebei Provincial Government to Tianjin may be a temporary expedient or there may be an overall plan. Because it is not known to outsiders, the citizens of Peiping are shocked and fearful after the scare is just over. We have witnessed the situation and dare not remain silent. We sincerely appeal to you to approve the Hebei Provincial Government to remain in Peiping and not move for the time being, to calm the people and maintain the overall situation. We are sincerely looking forward to it. Peiping Banking Association." (5th)</p>

<h3>Northern Ning Road Again Blocked by Water</h3>
<p>Shenyang Communication: The main line of the Northern Ning Road from Shenyang to Beiping, between Raoyang River and Baiqibao, was, after the heavy rain on the 30th of last month, due to the excessive rainfall in Xinlitun and other places in Zhangwu County, which flowed rapidly down to Raoyang River and Baiqibao. By the 1st of this month, the railway track at that location was submerged by the flood. On that day, all trains to and from Shenyang-Kaiping and Beiping-Shenyang, except for those that had already passed through before the water obstruction, had normally passed. However, Special Express Train No. 101 from Beiping to Shenyang arrived at Raoyang River Station at around 4 PM and was unable to proceed eastward due to the flooded railway. At 7:45 PM that evening, the 4th passenger train from Shenyang to Beiping was informed of the flood and immediately stopped selling tickets. At 9:45 AM on the 2nd, the through train to Beiping could not operate as scheduled due to the accumulated water between Raoyang and Baiqibao, preventing Train No. 101 from running. Only tickets for the 4th passenger train were sold to Xinmin. On the evening of the 3rd, the accumulated water in that section was finally drained by the railway authorities, and the damaged railway tracks were repaired. Train No. 101, which had been stopped at Raoyang River Station the previous night, began its eastbound journey, arriving at Shenyang Station at around 8 PM. The 4th passenger train from Shenyang to Beiping also resumed selling tickets as usual. From the 4th onward, all train services between Beiping and Shenyang have fully resumed operation. (3rd)</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Original Verdict of Zhang Taijie Case Overturned: Zhang Taijie (71 years old), the general manager of the Sichuan Road Company, was sued in the Shanghai District Court by Chen Shujia, Zeng Xianzhi, and others from Sichuan Province for embezzling company property. The Shanghai District Court sentenced Zhang Taijie on July 1st to three years of imprisonment for embezzling company property. Zhang Taijie, dissatisfied with the verdict, hired lawyer Yang Yinhang to appeal to the High Court. The High Court, through Judge Lin Dawen of the First Criminal Division, repeatedly held hearings and investigations, and the final hearing concluded on the afternoon of the 4th of this month, with the verdict scheduled to be announced on the afternoon of the 9th. Yesterday (9th) at 2 PM, Judge Lin, accompanied by Prosecutor Zhong Shangbin, arrived in court to announce the verdict. Judge Lin stood up and read the main text: The original verdict regarding Zhang Taijie's criminal punishment is overturned. Zhang Taijie is sentenced to one year of imprisonment for damaging company property. The number of days of detention before the verdict is finalized is allowed to be offset by two days for each day of imprisonment. The reason is that Zhang Taijie is innocent of the embezzlement charge. Zhang Taijie recovered 20,000 taels of silver from Cheng Xuelou, with interest that could be collected up to 30,000 taels. However, only 7,000 taels were received, resulting in a large loss for the company. Therefore, he is sentenced to one year of imprisonment for the crime of damaging company property.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Record of the Re-election of the Journalists Association: The Wuxi Journalists Association held a general meeting for the re-election of the fourth executive and supervisory committee members yesterday afternoon at the Railway Hotel. Twenty-five members attended, including Sun Dexian, Zhang Suichu, and Shi Qinglin.

Jiang Zhongliang, Jiang Yaoyong, and Sun Chunpu were elected as supervisory committee members. Subsequent News of Continuous Bandit Robberies and Kidnappings: In the Dengjiawan and Xiaoqiaotou towns, located at the intersection of the second and twelfth districts of Wuxi, five families, including Ling Azhang's, were continuously robbed by lake bandits, and seven male and female hostages were kidnapped. It is now learned that after the bandits kidnapped Ling Azhang and others, they drove them all into the boat. After casting off, they sailed straight into Yangcheng Lake before stopping. It was already dawn. The bandits arranged the hostages in a row and asked about their family's wealth in detail. When Ling and others claimed that they were not wealthy and pleaded for a reduction, the bandits were furious and threatened them with torture. Then, one bandit comforted them with kind words, ordering Ling Renda to go home first</p>
<p>to spread the word to the families of the hostages to quickly raise money for ransom. Renda's son, Jiansheng, was left on the bandit ship . The bandits said, "We have no grievances with you. If you prepare the ransom money, we will not make things difficult. However, the amount of money each person donates must be determined." It was estimated that You Junde, the owner of Sanmao Store, should pay 50,000 yuan, Ling Renda 30,000 yuan, Ling Yuanshun's daughter Asan 20,000 yuan, and Ling Azhang 15,000 yuan. Five yuan in silver dollars was given to Renda as travel expenses, forcing him to leave the ship and go home. Ling Baoxian, who was pregnant and about to give birth, was also ordered to return with Renda, instructing them to contact You Junde's mother, the owner of Sanmao Store, to negotiate after receiving a letter at home. After Ling Renda and Baoxian were released and landed, they asked the villagers to guide them to Weiting Station. They arrived at the station in the evening and took the train home in a state of panic. After receiving the news, Xu Wenrui, the director of the Public Security Bureau, has also dispatched a detective team to the countryside to investigate in order to pursue and arrest the bandits.</p>
<p>New Trends After the Suspension of Wuxi Silk Factories: The Wuxi Silk Factory Association, because of the sluggish silk market, slow silk sales, and excessive losses in various factories, was unable to maintain operations. The issue of the public inspection of raw silk by the Raw Silk Inspection Bureau has not been resolved satisfactorily. Previously, a general meeting of the industry was convened, and it was unanimously decided to unite with Shanghai colleagues and suspend operations. Since the 7th, 17 silk factories have suspended operations. As of yesterday, three more factories, including Taifeng, have suspended work, resulting in approximately 20,000 unemployed workers. If more factories continue to suspend operations after the Double Tenth Festival, the number will not be small. The Workers' Association believes that the suspension of factories has caused panic among most workers due to unemployment, and it is deeply related to the livelihoods of workers and social stability. Yesterday, they sent a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Provincial Party Headquarters, and the Provincial Government, requesting prompt relief and making three demands: (1) Request the government to promptly order all factories to resume work to maintain the livelihoods of workers; (2) Request the government to issue public bonds to provide relief and maintain operations until the silk market turns around; (3) Request the government to strictly order all factories that have suspended operations to pay daily living expenses to all employees until they reopen. The above points were written into a document and submitted yesterday. Currently, Wuxi has approximately 20,000 dan of silkworm cocoons in storage, including both spring and autumn cocoons. There is no shortage of raw materials.</p>
<p>The Dispute Over the Compound Ruler in the Silk and Satin Industry: The silk and satin industry in Wuxi has been very prosperous in recent years. The prices of various stores have always been uniform. This autumn, due to the opening of Jiu Sheng Xin, the entire industry held a large price reduction to compete for business, and the length of the ruler was slightly increased. After the price reduction period expired, the industry decided to restore the original prices. The dimensions on the counter should be increased by two units, and no more should be added. If private additions were found, the penalty method would be discussed. Previously, the store clerks of Dafengxiang, Yu Jiulun, Dingshuang, and Sheng Jiulun, who were on duty, investigated the ruler length at the Wuri New Silk Store on the 5th and found violations of private additions. They immediately questioned the store, but Rixin refused, leading to a conflict and even a fight. The Dafeng store clerk who was checking the dimensions suffered minor injuries due to being outnumbered and isolated. Afterwards, they went to the industry association for judgment. After mediation by the industry directors Jiang Jinghai and Xu Xiangwen, both parties agreed to a peaceful resolution. Unexpectedly, another misunderstanding arose in the evening. The four injured employees of Rixin rushed to Rixin for judgment. At this time, a second conflict occurred. Meng Zhendong of Dafeng and Tao Quansheng of Xiangyu twisted Mu Rongqing, the manager of Rixin, to the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau. Zhou Yangzhao, the director of the branch, interrogated him and advised the industry to resolve the matter through a meeting. However, it was already late at night, and it was agreed to renegotiate yesterday morning. However, the industry was outraged and there was no result. Both parties reported the injuries to the county yesterday afternoon, requesting a legal resolution.</p>

<h3>Memorial for Premier's Peril in London Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Municipal Executive Committee Convened a Memorial Meeting</p>
<p>Held at the Municipal Party Headquarters at 9:00 a.m.</p>
<p>The 11th of this month is the 34th anniversary of the Chinese Kuomintang Premier Sun Yat-sen's peril in London. The Municipal Executive Committee has specifically designated this day (the 11th) at 9:00 a.m. to convene all agencies, groups, schools, and party departments at all levels to send four representatives to the auditorium on the third floor of the Municipal Party Headquarters on Lin Yin Road, Ximen, to hold a memorial meeting. Rural areas such as Pudong, Jiangwan, Wusong, Zhenru, and Meilong will be led by the local party departments to hold memorial ceremonies. It is reported that the notice has been issued by the committee. The letter to the public and the letter to comrades are recorded on the left. Now, the Municipal Executive Committee's letter to the public is recorded below: Revolutionary people, what day is today? It is the anniversary of the Premier's peril in London, the critical moment for the survival of the Chinese nation and the continuation of the National Revolution. Sixteen years before the founding of the Republic of China, the Premier organized the Xingzhonghui in Honolulu to advocate revolution. In September of the same year, he plotted to attack Guangzhou with Deng Yin'nan and Lu Haodong, but the plot was revealed and failed. As a result, the Premier's name was spread throughout the country in the official gazettes of the Manchu Qing government, and a large reward was offered for the Premier's head. Since it was impossible for the Premier to stay in the country, he entrusted all the aftermath to his comrades, planning for future efforts. He then changed his clothes and disguised himself, traveling overseas to vigorously promote the revolution, hoping to expand the revolutionary forces. Unexpectedly, when he arrived in London, he was lured and arrested by Gong Zhaoyuan, the minister to Britain and France, and imprisoned in the embassy with the intention of harming him. Fortunately, with the help of the Englishman Kantler, he was able to escape. After the Premier's peril in London, the Premier's revolutionary reputation spread throughout the world, and the forces of the National Revolution in the country also expanded. In his own London Peril Record, the Premier said, "My knowledge of a political career,</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>really started in this year, and I ran around for national affairs and made my name known to the British people, which really started in this place." Therefore, the Premier's peril in London not only did not discourage the Premier's revolutionary spirit, but also increased the Premier's revolutionary courage and promoted the success of the revolution. The Premier devoted himself to the revolution for forty years, rising repeatedly after falling, and never giving up. His only purpose was to save the country and the people. Therefore, he resisted the aggression of the imperialists externally and resisted the high-handedness of the Manchu Qing government internally. Based on the results of his struggle and efforts, the fearless revolutionary spirit was finally able to gradually achieve his goals. Now that the Manchu Qing Dynasty has been overthrown, the warlords have gradually been eliminated, political tutelage has begun, and national affairs are about to enter the right track. Looking back on the past and pursuing the present, we confirm that the Premier's peril in London was indeed a critical moment for the survival of our Chinese nation. Therefore, when we commemorate the Premier's peril in London, we should emulate the Premier's self-motivation and continue the Premier's spirit of struggle to strive to complete the great cause of the National Revolution, so that we can comfort the Premier's spirit in heaven. Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. (The letter to comrades is omitted)</p>
<h3>Understanding and Efforts in Commemorating the Premier's London Peril</h3>
<p>(1) The Premier's Peril in London Was a Critical Moment for the Chinese Nation's Survival. In the third lecture on nationalism, the Premier said, "The Chinese national ideology is completely gone. In the past few hundred years, there is simply no nationalism to be seen in Chinese books. All one sees is singing the praises of the Manchus, what deep benevolence and thickness, what food and soil, and no one dares to say what the Manchus are..." From these words, one can imagine the Premier's determination to restore the Chinese national ideology and his spirit of resisting autocratic politics. Since the Manchus seized China, they have been imposing oppression on the Chinese nation. The Chinese nation has been overwhelmed by the Manchus' accumulated power for three hundred years, developing a slave mentality of seeking temporary peace and engaging in speculation and running around. The national spirit has been buried for a long time, and the descendants of the Yellow Emperor are in danger of extinction. The Premier took saving the country and the people as his own responsibility, resisting the aggression of the imperialists externally and resisting the high-handedness of the Manchu Qing government internally, striving to awaken the Chinese people and jointly plot the revolution for forty years, rising repeatedly after falling, with an indomitable spirit and clever and astute means, and finally overcoming all difficulties and gradually achieving the goal. The overthrow of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, the establishment of the Republic of China, and even the current unification of the country and the implementation of political tutelage, saving the Chinese nation from danger and establishing the foundation of world harmony, all depend on the Premier's more than forty years of struggle and leadership, and the inspiration and revelation of his personality and legacy. As we look back on the past and pursue the present, we confirm that the London incident was indeed a critical moment for the survival of our Chinese nation. Fortunately, God blessed the Chinese people, and the conspiracy failed. This great and noble revolutionary mentor was left to work for the welfare of the Chinese nation and the people of the world. On this 34th anniversary of the Premier's peril in London, how should we commemorate it with all our sincerity?</p>
<p>(2) The London Peril Was an Impetus to Increase the Premier's Revolutionary Courage. The London Peril Was the Key to the Success of the Premier's Revolutionary Career. All subsequent successes are extremely related to this. The Premier's broad and compassionate personality and bright and great career became even more glorious as a result, gaining the deep sympathy and assistance of people at home and abroad, and the revolutionary forces continued to grow. In his own London Peril Record, the Premier said, "My knowledge of a political career really started in this year, and I ran around for national affairs and made my name known to the British people, which really started in this place." In this atmosphere of sympathy and honor, the Premier increased his infinite revolutionary determination and courage. After escaping from danger, the Premier inspected the politics and customs of various countries in Europe and completed the profound and broad Three Principles of the People as the principle of the Chinese revolution. Once the center of the revolution was determined, more and more comrades came to join, and the Xinhai Revolution finally achieved success. Therefore, although the Premier's London Peril is an undeniable fact in revolutionary history, from the perspective of the entire revolutionary significance, it is the engine of the Chinese National Revolutionary Movement.</p>
<p>(3) The London Peril Was Only One of the Greatest Difficulties the Premier Experienced. In fact, throughout his life of struggle, he was always living in this kind of peril. As we commemorate the past and recall the legacy, we should have even more determination, vow to fight to the death, firmly believe in the doctrine,恪遵 the will of the people, and develop the party and the country that he founded with difficulty, and fulfill our major responsibilities. The Premier's will stated, "I have devoted myself to the National Revolution for forty years, and its purpose is to seek freedom and equality for China." Those who created China's unfreedom and inequality are none other than international imperialists and domestic feudal forces, which are also the objects of the Premier's lifelong struggle. In recent years, the oppression imposed on us by international imperialists has become more intense than before, especially economic oppression. The old and new warlords and corrupt elements in the country have also colluded with imperialists and united with the Communist bandits to constantly attack our party desperately, causing our party to be in turmoil at all times. The severity of the situation is almost greater than when the Premier was in danger. How should we emulate the Premier, inspire self-motivation, maintain an indomitable spirit, and make a ten-fight-ten-victory struggle, and be sure to thoroughly extinguish all counter-revolutionary forces, in order to comfort the Premier's spirit in heaven?</p>

<h3>Ji Da Overseas Chinese Student Association's Proposals Regarding Overseas Chinese Affairs</h3>
<p>A letter requesting the attention of the Overseas Chinese Federation to three matters</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation received a letter yesterday from the Overseas Chinese Student Association of National Jinan University, which stated, "Greetings, you all are working hard for the Party and the country, and are enthusiastic about overseas Chinese affairs. You are doing your best to promote benefits and eliminate drawbacks. You are upholding the weak and suppressing the strong, and you have done many things well. We all look forward to your achievements and secretly comfort ourselves. We regret that we have not been able to participate in the discussions to offer our services. Now, thanks to the government's measures, things are becoming more and more erratic, and the situation of overseas Chinese is becoming more and more precarious. Gentlemen, living in Xia Zheng, you are working diligently in your positions. There are a few things that we must tell you all, to express our views. Overseas Chinese have immigrated to the South Sea Islands, clearing thorns and building roads to develop the land. They have worked hard to build roads and develop the land. All the economic foundations and social organizations in the South Sea Islands have been developed with the strength of the overseas Chinese, especially in the Straits Settlements. Even the British, who are slightly more humane, are always mindful of this. However, now, on the pretext of the increase in unemployed workers, starting from August 1st of this year, they have banned the entry of adult Chinese workers. The impropriety of this plan has been explained in detail by Mr. Xie Piyi in Penang. We are all saddened by what we have seen, and we cannot bear to sit idly by and watch the overseas Chinese move towards extinction. We cannot but ask you all to pay attention, shout loudly, and appeal to and resist the governments at home and abroad. Secondly, Ms. Xiao Xin'an was insulted by the Dutch mate on her way to the Netherlands. Upon hearing this, her hair stood on end. These actions, which have exterminated all conscience and are of a base character, are being covered up by the so-called civilized people. How can this be tolerated? What is the point of blood? We should ask you all to argue forcefully according to reason to avenge the insult and promote national rights. Thirdly, the Siamese imperial brother will be visiting our country to observe and learn. He will be arriving in Shanghai soon. In order to promote Sino-Siamese relations and facilitate the conclusion of a Sino-Siamese treaty, we should give him a grand welcome at that time and take the opportunity to make contact. We cannot but ask you all to pay attention. All of this, we believe you all are familiar with, but we are especially afraid of accidents, so we are providing this as a reminder. We hope you will reply with your decision. To the National Overseas Chinese Federation." It is heard that the Overseas Chinese Federation stated that the three matters mentioned by the Student Association are all important to the country. In addition to the case of assisting Ms. Xiao, it has telegraphed all sectors to rise up and boycott the Java Shipping Company to act as a diplomatic backing. Regarding the reception of the Siamese Minister of Commerce, it has sent a letter to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the reception method. Regarding the case of the British Straits Settlements restricting the entry of adult Chinese workers, it cannot be allowed to continue, which will block the livelihood of overseas Chinese. It is planned to immediately telegraph the government according to the public opinion of all overseas Chinese, requesting the British government to make a practical negotiation as soon as possible to restore the original state of free entry in the past.</p>
<h3>Municipal Winter Grain Tax Increases Government Expenses</h3>
<p>The municipal government approved an additional two yuan per stone.</p>
<p>Since the 16th year, an additional two yuan for the Northern Expedition donation has been levied for each stone of grain tax collected in this city. In the 17th year of the busy grain tax, it was assigned to the Shanghai Special City Land Bureau for collection, and the Northern Expedition donation was still attached as before. In the 18th year, in accordance with the central government's order, this additional donation was cancelled. However, since the cancellation of this Northern Expedition donation in this city, the treasury revenue has decreased by more than 89,000 yuan. The municipal treasury budget feels even more tight. Now, in order to seek remedy, the municipal government has specially submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to follow the example of Jiangsu Province and continue to levy an additional two yuan per stone under the winter grain tax for the needs of local government expenses. The Executive Yuan has instructed that the record be approved.</p>
<h3>China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company Reorganization Committee Conversation Meeting</h3>
<p>The members of the committee for reorganizing the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company had been appointed by the National Government for a long time, but because Chairman Zhang Qun repeatedly declined, the various committee members have not yet taken office. Commissioner Li of the bureau, in view of the urgent need for various important affairs in the bureau to be carried out, specially invited the various committee members to the bureau at 10:00 a.m. on October 8th to hold a conversation meeting. Reorganization committee members Chen Xizeng, Guo Le, Li Guojie, Wang Yansong, etc. all arrived at the meeting on time to exchange opinions and agreed to hold a conversation meeting at the bureau every Wednesday before the reorganization committee members officially take office to discuss everything at any time.</p>
<h3>Negotiations for Sino-Japanese Wireless Photography</h3>
<p>Japanese Embassy Has Telegraphed Government for Study</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Communications signed a contract with Germany for wireless photography transmission, the results of the joint experiments have been quite good. Minister Wang now intends to continue the contract with the Japanese government to transmit wireless photography news between the two countries. He has discussed it with the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires, Shigemitsu Aoi, several times. Mr. Shigemitsu quite agrees and has already telegraphed the Japanese government from the Japanese Embassy to request instructions on how to proceed. It is said that it will soon become a reality.</p>

<h3>National Goods Fashion Exhibition</h3>
<p>Grand Opening Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday was the opening day of the city's National Goods Fashion Exhibition. From 3 p.m., well-known ladies and young women arrived in droves. For a time, the Dahua Hotel was filled with shining hairpins and jeweled hair ornaments, and all the seats were occupied. The total number of guests reached more than a thousand people, which can be described as an unprecedented event. The various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Opening Order (1) All stand at attention, sing the Party song, and give the most respectful salute to the Party's national flag and the portrait of the Premier; (2) The chairman respectfully reads the Premier's will; (3) Three minutes of silence; (4) The chairman delivers the opening speech; (5) Report on the preparations (Director Pan Gongzhan); (6) Speech (Ms. Yu Qingtang)</p>
<p>Chairman's Address Chairman Kong Xiangxi delivered the opening address, saying briefly: Today is the opening of the Shanghai Third National Goods Movement Conference. The National Goods Fashion Exhibition is held at the Dahua Hotel. I am very happy to be invited to participate. I would like to offer a few words of my feelings for discussion. It is undeniable that China's industry and commerce are lagging behind. To recover and remedy this situation, we must fundamentally use scientific methods to improve the manufacturing of domestic products, implement protective tariffs, and nurture infant industries. However, it is imperative to awaken the public so that men, women, old and young, throughout the country have a deep understanding and belief in the advantages of domestic products. The participation of women is especially important. Women's associations and other groups of the American Republican Party often advocate using domestic products for household necessities. This National Goods Fashion Exhibition has received enthusiastic support from female leaders in Shanghai and has become an unprecedented event. It is appropriate to set an example. This is the first thing that I find deeply gratifying. Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are necessary for our material life. This fashion exhibition can only solve a part of the clothing problem, but the impact will surely lead to the successive emergence and development of exhibitions of household goods, educational supplies, and public office store supplies. This is the second thing that I find deeply gratifying. The right to make the final appraisal of whether national goods are excellent or not always lies with consumers in society. Therefore, the psychological construction of consumers using national goods is what our producers should pay the most attention to. This Shanghai National Goods Movement Conference has gathered the newest, most unique, and most beautiful national goods fashions in one place, allowing people in Shanghai to clearly understand the advantages of national goods over foreign goods and the shortcomings of national goods compared to foreign goods. We will also vigorously maintain and guide the permanent national product joint market. With the joint cooperation of the government and merchants, the development of national products is guaranteed. This is the third thing that I find deeply gratifying. In addition to my joy, I sincerely wish the national goods a bright future with unlimited progress.</p>
<p>Report on the Preparations Director Pan Gongzhan reported on the preparations for the National Goods Fashion Exhibition, saying briefly: The National Goods Fashion Exhibition is opening today. We are very honored to have guests from all walks of life come to guide us, and ladies and gentlemen participate in the performance. The organizers of the conference are very honored. This conference was originally part of the city's Third National Goods Movement Conference. Because the National Goods Movement in previous years did not attract the attention of women, the preparatory committee invited Mrs. Mayor Zhang, Mrs. Supervisor Liu, Mrs. President Yang, Mrs. Wang Yansong, Ms. Guo Anci, Ms. Yu Xiuyun, Ms. Tang Guanyu, and other seven people to hold a tea party at the Hua'an Hotel to discuss ways to participate in the National Goods Fashion Exhibition. Fortunately, the ladies approved and actively proceeded. Today, we are able to hold a meeting here, which is the first of its kind and worthy of commemoration. What is also worth noting is that women of ambition are preparing a permanent Shanghai Women's National Goods Promotion Association. When preparations are complete and members are sought, we hope that everyone will participate enthusiastically. The preliminary preparations for today's exhibition were actually carried out by the gentlemen of the National Goods Movement Conference Preparatory Committee, which was organized by representatives of various agencies and groups. I have not made any effort at all and am very ashamed. In the past month, the Shanghai Silk Industry Association, the National Silk Industry Relief Association, the Electrical Silk Weaving Industry Association, Mei Ya Silk, Zhendan Silk Factory, Zhanghua Woolen Factory, Sanyou Industrial Society, and other companies and factories have donated valuable clothing materials and various products. Furthermore, Hongxiang Company, Yunshang Company, and others have donated labor for cutting and sewing. We are also very grateful for the enthusiastic participation of all sectors of society and the support and encouragement of various newspapers. As for the meaning of holding the National Goods Fashion Exhibition today, it is entirely to promote national goods, so that everyone understands that national goods clothing materials are indeed very suitable for making all kinds of men's clothing, and it is not necessary to use foreign goods. Therefore, today's performances include Western suits and casual wear for men, and long cheongsams, short cheongsams, and various Western suits for women. The clothing materials are all made of national goods. It is hoped that everyone will see this and break the bad idea of ​​always having to use foreign goods to make clothes. As for the recreational tea dance, it is just to add to the fun and increase everyone's interest in promoting national goods. Some people may misunderstand and think that this exhibition is like promoting fashion and approaching extravagance. In fact, the "fashion" in "fashion" is the "time" in "era". The clothing of people in the current era is "fashion". For example, the "Records of Contemporary People's Traces" in the newspaper does not necessarily refer to fashionable people. National goods fashion is just to explain that national goods can be used to make clothing for people in our era. Even if it is fashionable and beautiful, it is not necessarily bad. In the past, women's foot-binding was not good. Now, women have natural feet, and natural feet are fashionable. What's wrong with that? Now women cut their hair, and cutting hair is fashionable. What's wrong with that either? In the past, everyone considered using foreign goods to be fashionable. If we can change that now and compete to use national goods as fashionable, national goods will sell well from now on. What's wrong with that? Moreover, the love of beauty is human nature. If national goods can indeed make beautiful clothes, and everyone uses them and recognizes them as "fashion", it is much better than using foreign goods to make fashion, right? Shanghai is a place that sets trends. If everyone in Shanghai uses national goods to make clothes to wear, and by extension, everything that has national goods available, whether it is food or daily necessities, they all use national goods, people in other places will definitely slowly follow suit. The creation of this trend can reduce unemployment, recover rights and interests, and increase national wealth. If we talk about extravagance, is it extravagant to use expensive foreign goods, or is it extravagant to use cheap national goods? As long as everyone thinks about it, they can understand. Then, is promoting national goods clothing and not using foreign materials promoting extravagance, or is it reducing extravagance? I don't need to say it again. There is also a word that spoils the fun, and I would like to ask all the guests to pay attention to. On the surface, this meeting is full of joy and singing and dancing, as if to celebrate the National Day tomorrow. In fact, we organizers, participants, and guests who are giving us the honor of attending should all think calmly and feel extremely painful. Why do Chinese people themselves have to use Chinese goods to make clothes, and still have to shout loudly and try our best to promote it? If the annual import surplus of 400 million yuan could not be contributed to foreigners, then national goods fashion would have already been very popular, and we wouldn't need to promote it. Today's meeting can be said to be finding joy in suffering. Finally, the organizers would like to sincerely thank all sectors of society for their support. At the same time, I thank God very much for making it so beautiful with such good weather.</p>
<p>Celebrity Speech Ms. Yu Qingtang delivered a speech, saying briefly: I am very honored to have this opportunity to participate in the National Goods Fashion Exhibition today. What I want to discuss with you is the relationship between promoting national goods and women, as well as the relationship with the world economy. Many people say that women are consumers, and consumption means not generating profits. In fact, production and consumption have a close relationship. When consumption is appropriate, production can increase. Director Pan just reported that the Chinese import surplus of foreign goods reaches 400 million yuan every year. Most of this huge sum of money flows out through the hands of women. Therefore, if women are obsessed with foreign goods, then foreign goods will sell well. Conversely, if women promote national goods, then national goods can sell well. China has a population of 400 million, and women account for half of it. This power is very great. Secondly, in terms of international economics, the most important issue at present is the unemployment problem. We know that the causes of unemployment are due to excessive industrial production and blocked sales channels, and commercial decline. China is the world's largest market. If our women are obsessed with foreign goods, then foreign goods will sell well in China, which is indirectly solving the unemployment problem for foreign countries and directly increasing unemployment panic for our country. I hope that everyone will pay close attention to this point. If Chinese women correct their habits from now on and purchase national goods, the demand will increase immediately. The business community will naturally be happy to sell in bulk, and industrial production will also expand accordingly. The agricultural raw materials needed after industrial development will also increase, and agriculture will also develop accordingly. These are all related. I sincerely hope that the Women's National Goods Promotion Association will exist permanently, engage in investigating national goods and promoting them, and hope that the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors will continue to work together. I will follow you all and do my part to promote the development of national goods, etc.</p>
<h3>Bloating Disease Is Not Necessarily a Terminal Illness</h3>
<p>Traditional and Western Medicine Are Helpless, and Hundreds of Medicines Are Ineffective</p>
<p>Bloating Worry-Free Pills Achieve Miraculous Effects</p>
<p>A Letter of Thanks from Mr. Lou Guang</p>
<p>Bloating Worry-Free Pills are invented by Zhengwei Pharmacy (Hengjie, west end of Yong'an Company, Nanjing Road, Shanghai). They specialize in treating diseases such as qi stagnation, edema, abdominal bloating, fullness, blood stagnation in women, and infantile malnutrition. For more than ten years, they have achieved remarkable results and saved many people. Now, Mr. Lou's elder sister suffered from severe bloating. Fortunately, she read the advertisement in this newspaper and purchased these pills, which allowed her to recover. He specially sent a letter to express his gratitude (the original letter is printed below). The price of this pill is 20 yuan per dose, 10 yuan per half dose, and 5 yuan per box. Out-of-town mail orders do not incur postage. Detailed instructions are also available. Please contact Zhengwei Pharmacy for reading without charge. Lou Guang respectfully writes to the Honorable Zhengwei Pharmacy, stating that his elder sister suffered from bloating and was treated by famous doctors everywhere, but the effect was nil. His family was helpless, and the patient herself thought there was no hope of survival. I happened to read the advertisement for your pharmacy's Bloating Worry-Free Pills in the newspaper and immediately purchased a box and tried to take it according to the instructions. In just a few days, the disease suddenly recovered. It is truly worthy of being called the world's unique and unparalleled salvation medicine. I think that if my sister had not had this elixir, she would have had no hope of survival. Her subsequent years of life are truly bestowed by your pharmacy. I specially express my gratitude in person and record your great virtue in the slightest. I wish you peace and prosperity. Afternoon, October 19, 1922. Shanghai Beijing Road 2 Commercial Zhake Publicity Officer Lou Guang respectfully writes with his Lou Guang Seal.</p>

It is said that those who hold coupons to purchase clothing materials from the bureau will be calculated at cost price.</p>
<h3>Shipping Industry Plans to Establish a Shipping Bank</h3>
<p>Inaugural Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Stock Subscriptions Signed On the Spot</p>
<p>The local shipping industry is planning to establish a shipping bank as a preparation for developing business and recovering shipping rights. Because of the urgency of the organization, the Shipping Association invited all members to discuss the procedures, which have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, it also convened all members to hold the first inaugural meeting of the Shipping Bank. The members who attended included Yu Qiaqing, Shen Zhongyi, Liu Shisun, Chen Shuntong, Chen Xitang, Wang Bofen, Xu Zhongxin, Zhang Chunfu, etc., to discuss the procedures. The agreed organizational situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Stock Collection Process When it was proposed to establish a shipping bank last year, it was originally intended to ask the Customs to add 3/10 of a ton tax to imported ships as a bank fund. At that time, the Shipping Association conducted a survey and estimated that if it was implemented, the ton tax on Chinese merchant ships could increase by about 26,700 yuan. Shanghai merchant ships enter and exit, and foreign merchant ships account for the majority. An increase of 30% would result in an additional levy of more than 1 million yuan under foreign ships. At that time, Chinese shipping merchants were afraid that foreign merchants would not approve of the increase in taxes to be transferred to the bank fund. Shipping Association Chairman Yu Qiaqing contacted the British Swire and the American Dale and other shipping companies to inquire about their opinions. The executives of the two companies expressed sympathy for this. Subsequently, because Japanese ships and others could not agree, they changed their position and set the capital fund at 2 million yuan. In addition to the shares recognized by the shipping merchants, they asked the government to issue 10 million yuan of shipping public bonds to help establish the bank, and the increase in tax proposal was temporarily cancelled.</p>
<p>Stock Subscription At yesterday's meeting, the collection of stock funds was first put forward for discussion. It was decided that the members' shipping companies present would recognize the shares separately, based on the amount of ships owned as the standard for allocating the capital stock. After discussion, it was decided to allocate shares according to tonnage, with 1,000 tons as a unit, based on the tonnage registered with the Customs. Every 1,000 tons recognizes 100 shares, and each share is calculated at 100 yuan. All members present unanimously agreed and immediately signed the recognition. For example, the China Merchants Bureau recognized shares worth more than 400,000 yuan, and Sanbei He Ning Xing Hong'an recognized shares worth more than 160,000 yuan. The amount recognized by the other companies varied in size. Half of the recognized amount will be paid first, and the other half will be collected after the opening.</p>
<p>Appointing Preparatory Personnel After the stock funds were signed and recognized, the members nominated preparatory committee members to organize the bank. Six people were elected on the spot: (1) Yu Qiaqing, owner of Sanbei Company; (2) Yuan Ludeng, general manager of Ningshao Company; (3) Shen Zhongyi, head of the business department of the China Merchants Bureau; (4) Liu Shisun, manager of Nanhua Company; (5) Wang Bofen, manager of Zhengji Company; (6) Chen Ganqing, chief shipowner of Zhaoxing Company. These six committee members are responsible for the entire preparation. The address of the bank is determined to be in the old site of Yongnian Company on Guangdong Road. After the preparation is completed, another meeting will be held to determine the opening date.</p>
<p>Shipping Bond Issue It is requested that 10 million yuan of shipping public bonds be issued as part of the bank's capital fund and for the purpose of rescuing the shipping industry. It has now been agreed that the bonds will be guaranteed by customs duties. The government is requested to issue them to the Shipping Association, and the Shipping Association will transfer them to the Shipping Bank to be fully responsible for the issuance. This method was decided on the spot, and a request was submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval.</p>
<p>Attitude of Foreign Merchants Yu Qiaolao visited the English shipping power in China to inquire about their opinions on the establishment of a shipping bank to recover the Jianghai shipping rights.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>The Swire executive expressed sympathy for the Chinese people's recovery of shipping rights, saying that in recent years, the Chinese people's spirit has indeed risen vigorously. If the Chinese ships can meet the needs of commercial transportation on the Jianghai routes and there are no obstacles as in the past, foreign merchants will automatically give up without the Chinese people's negotiations. For example, on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, Swire's New Beijing ship has a higher turnover than the three Chinese ships. This year, it voluntarily gave up its superior position and cooperated with the three Chinese ships, sharing the income according to the ratio of eighty percent divided by four families, with each family getting twenty percent. The remainder of the New Beijing ship is used to compensate for the deficiencies of the New Jiangtian, New Ningshao, and Ningxing ships. Now, it voluntarily reduces its share to eighteen percent. This is a manifestation of the British merchants giving up their inland Chinese shipping rights. The HSBC and Mai Jia Li and other foreign banks in Shanghai also expressed their willingness to assist the Shipping Bank, so that China's shipping industry can improve.</p>
<h3>Japanese People Set Up Grocery Factories in Shanghai on a Large Scale</h3>
<p>Attempting to Avoid New Taxes... Countering Chinese Goods</p>
<p>According to the report of the Shanghai resident of the Osaka Prefectural Trade Hall, the recent export of groceries to Shanghai has been greatly embarrassed due to the pressure of Chinese factory products and the periodic increase in tariffs. They are setting up factories in Shanghai on a large scale to counter Chinese goods. For example, the Kobe Takekawa Rubber Factory, which exports 500,000 yuan worth of goods to Shanghai every year, is planning to set up a factory in view of the good results of the Taishan Rubber Factory's "Sakata Rubber Shoes". The lead industry is also planning to move to Shanghai. The Japan Lead Manufacturing Co. and the Tokyo Nasu Lead Manufacturing Co. are setting up a joint-stock company, purchasing land on Jixiang Street in Shanghai, and building a factory. The "Cultural Taste" seasoning manufacturer and the Kyushu Seasoning Manufacturing Co. have each sent personnel to inspect and investigate, and are prevalent in purchasing land and setting up factories. Suzuki Ajinomoto Co. is also planning to set up a factory, which is scheduled to be completed in early October.</p>

<h3>Big Fire in Nanshi Last Night</h3>
<p>More Than One Hundred Thatched Houses Destroyed</p>
<p>At about 10 o'clock last night, a thatched shed at the western end of Dapu Road in Nanshi suddenly caught fire. The fire spread rapidly, and the firelight illuminated the sky. The alarm was heard far and near, and the shouts were deafening. Fire brigades from various districts of Nanshi rushed to the scene, but the area was full of thatched houses close together, making it difficult to spray water. It took about an hour to put out the fire, but more than 100 thatched houses had been destroyed. The Public Security Bureau and the Second District General Office sent police officers to suppress the fire and arrested Yu Jinshan, a native of Yancheng, who was suspected of starting the fire. Yu, who is 27 years old and works as a coolie, confessed that the fire was caused by an overturned kerosene lamp. District Chief Wang, upon receiving the report, ordered that he be detained pending investigation and verification.</p>

<h3>The Second Day of Watching the Tide in Haining</h3>
<p>Yesterday the Tide Was Larger Than the Day Before</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day that the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway operated the special train for watching the tide in Haining. The number of passengers increased compared to the previous day, so the Vehicle Department of the Railway Bureau ordered the vehicle stock to add more vehicles. The special train was made up of fourteen carriages and was still towed by a double locomotive, carrying a total of more than 570 Chinese and foreign tourists and Railway Bureau staff and police officers. It still departed from the North Station at 5:30 am. The double locomotive was still dismantled on the two bridges, the thirty-first and thirty-fourth between Songjiang and Fengjing, and driven over the bridge separately. Then it was connected and towed to Fengjing Station, where it stopped for one minute. The locomotive was watered and drove straight to Xieqiao, arriving at the station at 8:45 am. The guests got off the bus and changed to small boats hired by the Railway Bureau, which carried them to the outside of the East Gate of Haining to land and walk to the tide-watching arena. After a short rest, lunch was completed. At about 1:15 pm, the sound of the tide was heard rumbling. From a distance, it looked like a white python flying. In an instant, the tide reached the front, and the tide waves rose higher than the first day, about a zhang high. The sound of the surging waves was like ten thousand horses galloping, and the snowy mountains were pouring down, which was truly spectacular. There were tens of thousands of people in the area around the seawall, and the viewers all applauded and praised. At 2:00 pm, the tide began to recede and flowed along the Qiantang River towards Hangzhou. After the guests finished watching, they returned to Xieqiao by the original boat. At 4:40 pm, the special train departed from Xieqiao and returned to Shanghai, arriving at the North Station at 8:05 pm at night. It is heard that today is the third day. It is appropriate that the Double Tenth Festival, various agencies and groups in Shanghai are on holiday, so there are quite a lot of people taking the train to Haining to watch the tide.

<h3>Mr. He Zhonglu Passed Away</h3>
<p>Mr. He Zhonglu, the father of He Shizhen, the former president of the Provisional Court, was a former Qing Dynasty tribute student, a successful candidate in the provincial examination, and an official to the rank of Vice-Minister of the Ministry of War. He was also appointed as a probationary circuit intendant. He was skilled in classical Chinese prose and proficient in medicine. His morals and writing were praised for a time.

<h3>Zhang Jingxian, Manager of Lao Shun Ji Hardware Store, Drowned in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Lost His Footing and Fell into the River While Seeing Off a Guest</p>
<p>No One Knew, Resulting in Drowning</p>
<p>Zhang Jingxian, the manager of Lao Shun Ji Hardware Store on Bailaohui Road, Hongkou, was over sixty years old, a native of Ningbo, and lived at No. 773, Yangzheng Lane, Tangshan Road. Around 6:00 PM the night before last, Zhang had a close friend who was going to Tianjin, departing from the Huashun Wharf on Gongping Road. Zhang went to the wharf to say goodbye. At that time, it was already late at night. The old man walked slowly, and one misstep caused him to fall into the Huangpu River. No one knew at the time. By 9:00 PM, the people in the store noticed that Zhang had not returned, so they ordered a chartered driver to go to the wharf to search everywhere, but could not find him. They mistakenly thought that he had returned to his residence to rest, so they did not pursue the matter. It was not until 6:00 AM yesterday that Zhang's body floated up. The police at Post No. 2430 found it, tried to retrieve it, and sent it to the Tongren Hospital for examination before being transferred to the mortuary for autopsy.</p>
<h3>Jiangzhe Silk Factories Industry Representatives Hold Regular Congress</h3>
<p>Discussing Ways to Proceed</p>
<p>The sales of foreign raw silk this year have been extremely sluggish, especially for Shanghai factories. The cost of silk is high, while the selling price is low. Each silk factory is maintaining operations at a loss, and funds have been almost completely depleted, making it impossible to continue supporting the businesses. Among the 106 silk factories in Shanghai, 80 to 90 percent have already declared closure one after another. Silk factory operations are in a precarious state, full of dangers, and on the verge of total bankruptcy. It has been publicly discussed to appeal to the government to issue 5 million yuan in silk industry bonds to rescue the silk factory industry in Shanghai. The Shanghai Silk Factories Industry Association has already appointed seven committee members, including Shen Huachen, Huang Jinchen, and Zhu Jing'an, to handle the rescue matters. It is now learned that there are a total of 48 silk factories in Wuxi, 2 in Zhenjiang, and 20 to 30 in Zhejiang Province, including Hangyuan, Tangxi, Jiaxing, Chang'an, Xiashi, Huzhou, Wuxing, Nanxun, Zhuji, and Xiaoshan, which are all in the same state of depression. Without funds to maintain operations, declarations of closure are occurring one after another. They have now separately sent letters to the Shanghai Silk Factories Industry Association Relief Committee, requesting to join together and jointly submit a request to the government to appeal for an additional 10 million yuan in silk industry bonds to provide universal relief. The committee has now separately sent reply letters to the silk factories industry associations in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Shaoxing, Wuxi, and other places, asking them to immediately nominate responsible representatives, five from Wuxi and three from Zhejiang, to come to Shanghai immediately. The Jiangzhe Silk Factories Industry Representatives Congress will be held at 3:00 PM on the 12th of this month (Sunday) to jointly discuss ways to proceed.</p>
<h3>Chaozhou-Meizhou National Goods Investigators to Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Letter Requesting Guidance</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factories United Association received a letter yesterday from the Chaozhou-Meizhou National Goods Industry and Commerce United Association, which stated that in order to develop and promote the national goods business, contact propaganda industries, and for the sake of reality, the third meeting of the Standing Committee decided to publicly recommend Mr. Ou Huaqi, Chairman of the Association, and Mr. Ye Bingnan to come to Beijing and Shanghai to investigate the national goods situation so that the Chaozhou-Meizhou side can reform and follow suit, so that the promotion can be unified and the development can be hoped to be infinite. Because the Shanghai Association is the guide of national goods and the model of industry in Shanghai, a special letter is requested for verification. It is requested that when Mr. Ou and Mr. Ye arrive, provide proper guidance so that the investigation can be carried out quickly and the benefits can be expected to be detailed. Then the glory of the Association's future development will be bestowed by the Association.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Advocates Imitation of Foreign Paper</h3>
<p>Introducing the Jiangnan Company to Send Personnel to Investigate</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the chambers of commerce in Jinan, Qingdao, Bengbu, and Tongshan yesterday, stating that on the 8th of this month, a letter was received from the Jiangnan Paper Manufacturing Company, stating that in order to investigate the industry situation in various places and promote the company's products, Mr. Xu Shaoxin, an employee, was specially dispatched to Xuzhou, Bengbu, Jinan, and Qingdao to contact and proceed with the work. Fearing unfamiliarity with the people and places, which would cause many inconveniences, it is proposed that the chambers of commerce in the four places be requested to send letters to introduce him in advance, and to provide instructions on everything when Mr. Xu arrives, so that he can follow them. The company is a member of the Chamber of Commerce, and has raised shares and established a factory in Shanghai to imitate various types of foreign paper with machines for several years. The products strive for excellence and have a good reputation among the Chinese paper factories at sea. This time, sending personnel to various places to investigate and seek to expand sales is a matter of promoting national goods paper and reversing the outflow of profits. Accordingly, the situation is described in a letter requesting the Chamber of Commerce to provide assistance in general, and to provide detailed guidance at any time when Mr. Xu Shaoxin, an employee of the company, arrives, so that this trip can achieve satisfactory results.</p>
<h3>Russian Merchants Purchase 3,000 Boxes of Chinese Tea</h3>
<p>Russian Cooperative Society Purchases and Transports to Russia</p>
<p>Inventory Piles Up, Market Stagnates</p>
<p>Recently, the sales of Chinese tea to foreign firms have been very sluggish. The Russian tea is also piled up in large quantities due to special circumstances.

However, there is still a lot of inventory, and it is difficult for the market to turn around.</p>
<h3>Japan's Trade Volume with China for Nine Months of This Year</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese Commercial Counselor's Office, in September,</p>
<p>Japanese goods exported to China were worth 31 million Japanese yen, while Chinese goods exported to Japan were worth only 10 million yen, a difference of as much as 21 million Japanese yen. In the first nine months of this year, the amount of Japanese goods imported has exceeded the amount of Chinese goods exported by 70 million Japanese yen. From the Chinese side, this cannot be said to be a huge leakage of wealth. However, compared to the same period last year, it has decreased by 60 million Japanese yen. It is also heard that the Japanese Wholesale Merchants Association in Shanghai, in order to promote trade with China, plans to set up a commercial museum in Shanghai to display all Japanese products, estimating the cost at 1 million Japanese yen. It is planned to request government subsidies. This document has been forwarded to the Japanese government by the Japanese Consulate General yesterday, and a copy has been submitted to the Commercial Counselor stationed in China.</p>
<h3>Exemption of Stamp Duty on Grain and Rice Receipts During the Period of Price Stabilization</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Guangzhou Rice Merchants Association yesterday, stating that on September 27, a letter was received stating that the rice and grain stamp duty increased the burden, and requested that it be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for approval to exempt it in order to maintain the people's food. After reporting the situation, the Ministry of Finance replied on the 8th of this month, stating that the Ministry had previously received telegrams from the Guangzhou General Chamber of Commerce and others, requesting the cancellation of the one-yuan rice receipt stamp duty. The Ministry had temporarily approved the maintenance of the original plan, requiring stamp duty only for rice receipts of ten yuan or more, and temporarily allowing exemption during the price stabilization period. The instructions have been issued in succession. Considering the people's food, everything has been done to the utmost. The request for exemption from stamp duty should not be discussed. A copy of the instructions has been printed and distributed. The letter is sent for your information.</p>

<h3>Resolution of Election Disputes in the Fresh Meat Industry</h3>
<p>When the Shanghai Fresh Meat Industry Consolidation Committee held its inaugural meeting to elect executive committee members, due to suspicions of fraud, it was ordered to re-elect, but it was not approved and filed by the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau. Later, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce reported that Shen Daqing, a member of the association, was indeed hosting a private banquet, and his right to be elected had been declared invalid on the spot by the representative of the Party Department. It was requested that a full re-election be waived. Yesterday, the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau approved the report, stating that the election of executive committee members by the Fresh Meat Industry Association previously had suspicions of bribery, which was refuted by the Municipal Citizens Training Association. Since it was claimed that Shen Daqing was hosting a private banquet and did not want to be elected, it was understandable. The bureau had already sent a letter to the Municipal Citizens Training Association to request the revocation of the previous order, in addition to another</p>
<p>Approval to file for record, is hereby forwarded for notification, this approval.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Customs Inspects Shanghai Ships for Epidemics</h3>

<h3>Trade Associations Maintain Industry Rules</h3>
<p>Because the Intestine Industry Association and other trade associations were dissatisfied with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's reply that industry rules should be uniformly observed, they planned to jointly request the National Government to order the Ministry to re-examine the matter. It is learned that dozens of associations, including the Wood Industry, Seafood Industry, New Medicine Industry, Medicinal Materials Industry, Bamboo Industry, and Ice Factory Industry, have repeatedly exchanged letters and unanimously urged the Intestine Industry Association to draft a submission. Now, Zhang Jueyi, the secretary of the association, has completed the first draft, which is several thousand words long. Based on party principles and legal principles, it refutes the issue in detail. It is said that the association will send a staff member, Li Shiyuan, to invite representatives from various associations to discuss the draft on the day after tomorrow. Once it is revised, representatives will be sent to Beijing to submit it.</p>
<h3>National Products Department Store Open as Usual</h3>
<p>The Nanjing Road China National Products United Department Store originally planned to close today in accordance with the law, so that all employees could enjoy the festivities of celebrating the National Day for the whole day. However, since the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau happened to be holding the 3rd National Products Movement Conference in the department store, with the promotional period from October 7th to 13th for a week, it was not convenient to close down and hinder the progress of the conference. Now, after considering the special circumstances, it has been decided to hold a celebration of the National Day in the auditorium at 9:00 AM, and from 10:00 AM, it will still operate as usual, so that people from all walks of life can take the opportunity to participate in the National Products Movement Conference and practice promoting national products on this day. All manufacturers in the department store have been notified to handle it in accordance with the decision. All those who purchase national products in the department store today will be given entertainment tickets and special publications for the National Products Movement Conference.</p>

<h3>Man Killed by Car</h3>
<p>At 11:30 a.m. yesterday (i.e., the 9th), Han Amao was driving a truck loaded with pigs to the Slaughtering Cattle Company for slaughter, when he accidentally hit an unnamed man, about 50 years old, wearing a white shirt and trousers, on Guohuo Road in Nanshi, crushing his vital organs.

<h3>How Did Luo Mingqing Die?</h3>
<p>Chen Cheng Claimed He Died of Internal Illness</p>
<p>The Court Ordered to Obtain a Diagnosis Before Reviewing</p>
<p>Chen Cheng, a surgeon at Renji Hospital, drove his own car past the Baiyun Temple in Ximen more than ten days ago and knocked down Luo Mingqing, who lived in Lane 5, Jiadeli, Xiqiao, crushing his right leg. At that time, Chen took him to his own hospital in his own car for treatment and amputated a section of his right leg to save his life. However, Luo was not saved and died the day before yesterday. It was reported to the Local Court, and Prosecutor Yang and others came to the hospital for examination and naturally determined that he died from his injuries. However, Chen Cheng, based on his medical knowledge, claimed that the deceased's injuries were not fatal and that he died from another internal illness. In order to be convinced, the prosecutor ordered Dong Jianqing, the head of the 25th Bao, 13th District, to carry the body to the court's forensic examination office. In the afternoon, the forensic doctor Gu Nanqun dissected the body for a long time to diagnose whether he died from any disease. He has not yet obtained a detailed diagnosis, so the family temporarily collected the body to wait for further action.</p>
<h3>Man Hanging from a Mulberry Tree</h3>
<p>At around 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, an unnamed man was found hanging from a wild mulberry tree behind the Zhangjia Residence in Xidong, Jiaotong Road, Zhabei. He was about 30 years old, wearing a white cloth jacket and black gauze shorts, with white socks and black shoes. He was using a belt to hang from a tree branch, with his feet in the air, his eyes bulging, and his tongue sticking out more than an inch, which was very scary. Liu Sansan, the local head, reported the incident to the Zhongshan Road Police Station in the Fourth District, ordering the police to investigate. There were no injuries on his body. A piece of paper was found next to the deceased, with the three words "Cai Guilin" written on it, which may be his name. There were also three pawn tickets, all for items of several cents, which could be determined to be poor. He reported the matter to the General Office and then reported to the court. Yesterday morning, a commissioned inspector arrived to examine the body and found that the unnamed male corpse had committed suicide by hanging himself and no one claimed the body. He ordered the local head to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>Intrusion into People's Homes in Broad Daylight</h3>
<p>Violent Bandit Behavior</p>
<p>Xu Yaosheng Detained</p>
<p>Wu Li's family, who lives at No. 44, Daokong Lane, in the city, engaged in gold exchange business, was suddenly visited by four people dressed in gray cloth shorts and wearing copper basin hats at more than 1 p.m. yesterday. One person went upstairs, and three people guarded the door downstairs. Unexpectedly, the person upstairs first grabbed Wu Li's son, Wu Qinyan (28 years old), by the neck and asked where Wu's opium was hidden. Before Wu could answer, they punched and kicked him. Then another person went upstairs, overturning boxes and cabinets, searching arbitrarily, but found no contraband. Wu's mother, Wu Li, was extremely frightened, so she pleaded with Xu Yaosheng, who was guarding downstairs. Since there were no contraband items, she was willing to give ten yuan as a gift. Xu Yaosheng pretended to be a mediator, but the two people who grabbed Wu's son upstairs insisted on two hundred yuan. Wu Li's, because the family had no cash, so he borrowed ten yuan from the Yao family next door and gave it as a double reward. These people still refused to agree. After learning the situation from the neighbors, they ordered the maid to call Liu Shulin, the tenth sentinel police officer of the Second District, Second Precinct, and Li Xingbang, the resting police officer, to Wu Li's home, detaining Xu Yaosheng. The other three people escaped. The original was brought to the place and twenty yuan was found next to Xu Yaosheng, and a certificate from the Anhui South Salt Affairs Anti-Smuggling Bureau was requested. According to the presiding judge Guo's interrogation, the plaintiff Wu Li's supply was the same as above. According to Xu Yaosheng's confession, he was from Dongyang, Zhejiang. I came to Shanghai in February last year, and then went to the Song Minister's residence in Nanjing to serve as a guard. Later, because the ancestral hall was being renovated, I asked for a long vacation and returned to Shanghai, living with my brother (ie, No. 44, Hua'anfang). In May and June of this year, my brother introduced me to the Huainan Anti-Smuggling Bureau as an investigator. Now I have taken a sick leave and come to Shanghai, which has been a month. I first lived in my brother's residence, and now I live in the Shanghai-Hangzhou Hotel. Today at 1:30 p.m., I met my brother's friend at Hanqiao, who asked me to come to Wu's home in Nanshi to pick up opium. Wu Li's then took out twenty yuan and put it in my bag. I didn't extort it. I was arrested as soon as I mediated and went out. According to Guo, the director, Xu Yaosheng's confession was completely unfounded. The case involved intrusion into residential households in broad daylight and the implementation of violent bandit behavior. The people and evidence were sent to the Public Security Bureau for legal action.</p>
<h3>Bao Daxiang Robbery Case Undergoes Change</h3>
<p>Anonymous Letter Leads to Arrest of Five People</p>
<p>No Occupation, Ordered to Provide Store Security</p>
<p>Bao Daxiang Western cloth store, outside Xiaodongmen French Concession Avenue, recently sent an old accountant to send foreign banknotes to various money houses when six bandits with guns suddenly robbed him, losing more than 6,600 yuan. Afterwards, the manager of the store, Kaiming, lost the bill and reported it to the relevant police station to investigate the stolen goods. As recorded in this newspaper, the store suddenly received a letter from the postman the day before yesterday. After opening it, he learned that this letter was sent from Zhenjiang to report the bandits who robbed the giant amount of Bao's store, now hiding in a certain building number in Nanyangqiao, Shanghai French Concession. The store then took the original to the police station outside Xiaodongmen to report it. After the patrol leader checked it, he immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to arrest the five people one after another in the house without making a sound, and brought them into the police station. The old accountant who sent the silver that day was summoned to the police station to identify them. According to the silver messenger, after identifying them one by one, he confessed that he could not clearly identify the several people he had captured at the moment, and that he was panicked and anxious when he was robbed at that time, making it difficult to point out the facts. The patrol leader thought that the people he had captured were not the robbers in this case, but they were all unemployed and not good people. They have now been ordered to find reliable store security to allow them to be released on bail. On the one hand, they will conduct another investigation into the real thieves in this case, and they must be arrested and taken to court.</p>
<h3>Mei Fei Case Adjudicated</h3>
<p>Mei Fei Sentenced to Two Months in Prison, Suspended for Two Years</p>
<p>The case of the prostitute Mei Fei (ie, Chen Junxia) being accused by Ms. Zhao Tanmeiying and lawyers Lu Qi and Zhao Zuwei in the Special Zone Court of colluding with Hu Yongquan to misappropriate Fang receipts was concluded after repeated interrogations by the court. Because Hu had absconded and could not be arrested, it was ordered to temporarily suspend the trial. Mei Fei paid a thousand dollars to be released on bail pending judgment, and when the date of judgment arrived, new evidence was discovered, so it was ordered to postpone the date and reopen the debate. As recorded in this newspaper, the case was re-debated on Thursday of last week and concluded. Mei Fei was ordered to pay an additional 2,000 yuan for release on bail. The judgment date was announced yesterday morning. Mei Fei was summoned to the case, and Presiding Judge Sun Yuanjun announced the judgment in the Second Criminal Court. The main text of the judgment stated that Chen Junxia (ie, Mei Fei) was guilty of joint embezzlement and was sentenced to two months of imprisonment, suspended for two years. Hu Yongquan's trial procedure was suspended. Chen shall return the four Jiangwan township Fang receipts under the name of Zhao Jinchang to the plaintiff, Zhao Tanmeiying, for safekeeping. The original security shall be paid within the appeal period.</p>
<h3>Trial of Qian Acai, Accused of Murdering His Wife</h3>
<p>Bloodstains on the Deceased's Neck</p>
<p>Purple Blood Accumulated in the Internal Organs</p>
<p>Qian Acai, a Yongbo native from No. 721 Yangshupu Road, was arrested by the Huishan Patrol and brought to the Special Zone Court for interrogation and detention for allegedly murdering his wife, Qian Xuan (also known as Axiang), between 7 p.m. on the 18th of last month and 7 a.m. the next morning. According to the forensic doctor, the deceased's face and neck had bloodstains, and after dissection, there was purple blood in her internal organs. She was indeed suffocated to death. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide opened the court to continue the interrogation. According to Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the Patrol, it was impossible to investigate whether the deceased was suffocated to death by the defendant during the postponement. According to Xuan Zhang, the deceased Axiang was my daughter. At the age of five, she went to the defendant's house as a child bride. She married on September 11 last year, and the relationship between the couple was harmonious. Later, I went to Yichang in another port, and then information was lost. I heard the news on the 4th of this month and came to Shanghai to find out that my daughter was actually caused by the defendant's aunt, causing this incident. However, the aunt has already absconded, and the neighbors nearby all know that my daughter usually has no improper behavior, etc. According to Zhang Li, a woman who lived with them, the reason for the quarrel that night was that the defendant's aunt asked the deceased for food expenses, causing the couple to quarrel. At that time, I was upstairs and did not hear the deceased shout downstairs, etc. When questioned by the defendant, he insisted that he had a quarrel with the deceased about washing clothes. At that time, he only hit her head twice with his hand. At 7 a.m. the next morning, he saw his wife sleeping on the table. Zhang Li asked me to help her to the bed, and the aunt suspected that she had taken poison, so she poured soapy water into her, which was ineffective. She was sent to the hospital and died on the way. I did not murder her. The rest of the supply was vague. According to Li E, the defendant's aunt, who is my sister, also provided the details. After Judge Feng Shide verified the supply, he ordered the defendant to be detained for further interrogation at a later date.</p>

<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>Thank You to Those Who Supported the National Products Movement (Continued) Pan Gongzhan</h3>
<p>It is evident that it is still not developed. Not only is it not developed, but in recent years it seems to be declining. Why is it not developed and instead declining? If the reason for this can be found, it is where the difficulties of the national product's future lie. If we do not immediately catch up and work together to overcome this difficulty, then the national product will inevitably be eliminated and decline due to this fatal blow. We must thank you for your enthusiasm in promoting national products, and we must solemnly raise the question of "how to overcome the difficulties in the future of national products" in this conference and jointly seek a practical and effective solution. Otherwise, not only will this conference still be meaningless, but the decline of national products will become even more severe in the future. The central government has stipulated that the national product movement is one of the seven mass movements. Is its original main purpose just to teach us to hold meetings and shout slogans? If not, we should jointly take responsibility, regardless of party, government, workers, businessmen, men, women, producers, or consumers, and work together to overcome the difficulties in the future of national products. What is the state of industry in China? Let's put that aside for now and first ask about Shanghai. Shanghai is the center of industry and commerce. If Shanghai's industry and commerce are declining, the whole country can be imagined. First, let's look at the history of the establishment of factories in Shanghai. According to a survey by the Social Affairs Bureau in the 17th year of the Republic (1928), there were 1,781 factories of all sizes. About 1,500 factories were surveyed. Except for those that did not report the year of establishment, only 101 factories were established before the Republic. Since the Republic, the number has increased every year, and the increase has been especially rapid after the 7th year of the Republic. By mid-16th year of the Republic (1927), the number had increased by 243 factories. However, in the 17th year of the Republic (1928), it dropped sharply and only increased by 92 factories. The number of factories established during the following periods is listed below: Before the Republic, 101; 1st year of the Republic (1912), 28; 2nd year of the Republic (1913), 29; 3rd year of the Republic (1914), 26; 4th year of the Republic (1915), 31; 5th year of the Republic (1916), 38; 6th year of the Republic (1917), 27; 7th year of the Republic (1918), 41; 8th year of the Republic (1919), 67; 9th year of the Republic (1920), 59; 10th year of the Republic (1921), 90; 11th year of the Republic (1922), 70; 12th year of the Republic (1923), 94; 13th year of the Republic (1924), 81; 14th year of the Republic (1925), 117; 15th year of the Republic (1926), 153; 16th year of the Republic (1927), 243; 17th year of the Republic (1928), 92. However, if we investigate why the trend of increasing the number of factories in the 17th year of the Republic suddenly dropped, the general answer from the industrial and commercial community is roughly two points: (1) The Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army. The ravages of war have not yet recovered, transportation is blocked, sales have decreased sharply, and there is no profit to be made from investing in industry. (2) Labor unions have sprung up, labor-management disputes are endless, workers are arrogant, and businessmen regard investing in factories as a dangerous path. Therefore, existing factories are difficult to maintain and have been suspended one after another, and it is naturally difficult to establish new factories. Second, let's look at the capital of each factory in Shanghai, which is even more surprising to the Chinese people. Among the more than 1,500 factories, Chinese factories account for 1,441, Japanese factories 56, British factories 32, American factories 16, French factories 7, and other factories 19. At first glance, it seems that domestic factories are the most developed. In fact, the invested capital is about 145,524,000 yuan for Japanese factories, about 103,303,000 yuan for Chinese factories, about 66,269,000 yuan for British factories, about 682,000 yuan for American factories, about 6,270,000 yuan for French factories, and about 1,800,000 yuan for other factories. The total capital of factories in the city is about 330 million yuan, and the capital of domestic factories accounts for only one-third, which is not enough to compete with foreign-funded factories in Shanghai. Moreover, a large amount of foreign goods is continuously imported from overseas ships. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor of Shen Bao, I recently read in your newspaper's local news section about the Shanghai Entertainment Conference for the Liaoxi flood, which mentioned Mrs. Chairman Jiang, which is a rumor. Chairman Jiang and Mrs. Jiang have indeed provided significant assistance to the Liaoxi flood, but the entertainment conference is an organization for raising disaster relief funds for the community and is a separate matter. Your newspaper accidentally conflated the two, so I am issuing this statement to avoid misunderstandings. Wishing you peace, respectfully, Zheng Yuxiu, Preparatory Member of the Shanghai Entertainment Conference for the Liaoxi Flood, October 9th.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, In your newspaper's local news column on October 8th, there was a section on the settlement and release of the Fuqing steamboat lawsuit. This is not consistent with the facts. The Fuqing steamboat was previously detained by the court at the request of Mianxing Company because Chen Fuchen of Fuxing Company reneged on the contract midway, and a lawsuit was filed to request the return of the deposit and compensation for losses. The case is currently being handled by my law firm and is in progress. The mention of a settlement is inaccurate. I am sending this letter to you in the hope that you will make corrections to clarify the facts. Sincerely, Lawyer Xu Zuyan, October 9th.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, In your newspaper on the 4th of this month, it was reported that Shi Bingrong, known as the "King of Flower Gambling," opened a Yongxingxiang paper shop near Fangbang Bridge within the French Concession as a front for establishing a flower gambling parlor and was arrested by the French police and taken to the police station. I was shocked and horrified to read this. I, the undersigned, am indeed engaged in the business of running the Rongxingxiang paper shop and am completely unaware of the flower gambling matter. The person who was arrested was Zhang Deren, a tenant of the store's rented upper floors, who was fined 100 yuan by the court, as there is a record to prove. Furthermore, I happened to be in Hangzhou on business, and the facts reported in your newspaper are inconsistent with the truth and are the result of inaccurate reports from the reporter. This matter concerns my reputation, so I am sending this letter to your office in the hope that you will make corrections and publish the letter for the public's convenience. Respectfully submitted, Shi Bingrong, Proprietor of Rongxingxiang Store, October 9th.</p>

<p>Important Educational News</p>
<h3>Ministry Order Requires Schools Above the Junior College Level to Submit Student Information on Age, Origin, and Education</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, in order to require schools above the junior college level to submit information on the age, origin, and education of new students, transfer students, and faculty and staff, has issued instructions to national universities, colleges, specialized schools, and municipal education bureaus, as well as instructions to the education departments of various provinces, stating that, as the academic year for the 19th year is about to begin, the names, ages, origins, and class designations of new students and transfer students admitted by various schools above the junior college level, the schools from which they graduated or attended, and other information, along with the graduation or attendance certificates of the students, and the names, ages, origins, education, subjects taught or positions held, full-time or part-time monthly salaries, and dates of arrival at the school of the faculty and staff of the schools, must be carefully and accurately verified and reported in a list. In the future, new students or transfer students who are continuously admitted and faculty and staff who are newly hired should also be reported at any time. The above two items should be reported to the Ministry for verification within one month of receiving the document. In addition to issuing separate orders, this order is also being issued to the provincial education departments to forward to provincial and registered private schools above the junior college level for compliance.</p>
<h3>Educational Associations and Education Bureaus Use Formal Submissions for Official Documents</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, according to a report submitted by Wu Guanqing and others, the standing committee members of the Qingdao Municipal Education Association, stated that the Qingdao Municipal Education Association was organized and established in July of this year in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the Ministry. After that, all matters concerning education in the city that should be promoted or reformed should be done in accordance with the regulations. However, the status of the education association and whether to use formal submissions or official letters for official documents with the municipal education bureau are not clearly defined in the initial stage of establishment, and it is unknown what to do. Therefore, a document is prepared and submitted to the Ministry for review and interpretation in order to have something to follow. The Ministry of Education's response stated that the report was noted. It was found that the Ministry's Instruction No. 1087 last year stipulated that the seals used by the education associations of provinces, cities, and counties should be issued by the provincial education departments or municipal and county education bureaus upon submission by the associations. Therefore, the association should use formal submissions for documents to the municipal education bureau. Compliance is expected.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education's Opinion on the Competent Authority of Primary Schools in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, according to a report from the Guangdong Education Department, stated that it was ordered to review and approve the procedures for establishing and registering private primary schools based on the report from the Zhejiang Education Department requesting changes. After that, the municipal and county education bureaus will be the competent authorities for private primary schools, and all establishment procedures will still be handled in accordance with the regulations for private schools. The report will be submitted to the education department for record after approval by the municipal and county education bureaus. Private complete primary schools will still be under the jurisdiction of the education department. The order should be forwarded to the subordinates for compliance. However, there are points that need to be requested for instructions, which are listed as follows: (1) According to Article 16 of the County Organization Law and Article 17 of the City Organization Law, the education bureau may be changed to a section. If the county or city does not have a dedicated education bureau according to this organization, should the primary school be directly under the municipal or county government, or should it still be under the direct authority of the education department? (2) Except for Guangzhou, the other cities in Guangdong Province do not have educational institutions. The organization of the education bureaus in the counties is mostly incomplete due to limited funding. The monthly bureau fee is mostly three to four hundred yuan for those with more funds and fifty to sixty yuan for those with less funds. Some bureaus only have one bureau director or one or two staff members. Some bureaus have even been changed to sections, and the position of section chief is concurrently held by the chief of another section or the police chief. In this situation, if the primary school is completely under its jurisdiction, it is feared that it will be difficult to be effective. Can the Education Department separately investigate and select those with more complete organizations to follow the instructions, while the primary schools in the remaining incomplete organizations will still be under the jurisdiction of the Education Department to ensure prudence? In accordance with the previous order, a report should be submitted to the Ministry for review and approval. The Ministry of Education instructed the Education Department that the report was noted. It was found that the Ministry's Instruction No. 798 stipulated that the municipal and county education bureaus should be the competent authorities for private primary schools, which was originally intended to facilitate the implementation of compulsory education and should be unified throughout the country. Now, according to the two points listed in the report requesting instructions, special explanations are given as follows: (1) Private primary schools in cities and counties that do not have a dedicated education bureau should be under the jurisdiction of the municipal and county governments, and the establishment should be approved by the municipal and county governments and submitted to the education department for record. (2) It is true that the organization of the education bureaus in the counties is mostly incomplete, but it is too much to say that they cannot even manage primary schools. Moreover, according to the Ministry's regulations, private primary schools must still be submitted to the education department for record after being approved for establishment by the municipal and county education bureaus. Therefore, the ultimate power of approval still rests with the education department. The request in the report to investigate the organization of the municipal and county education bureaus and handle them separately based on whether they are complete or not should not be discussed.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Commends the Anhui Library</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education ordered the Anhui Education Department to issue Instruction No. 204, stating that it had received the work report of the provincial library for the first half of the 19th year and requested review. The report and attachments were noted. After reviewing the various aspects of the work, it was found that they were still important and commendable. In the future, the Education Department should continue to supervise the staff of the library to actively organize and expand it to benefit education, and report the progress of the work at any time.</p>
<h3>The Hangzhou News Society is About to be Established</h3>

<h3>World Baseball Tournament Runner-Up Championship Maintained</h3>
<p>The Sixth Time, Runner-Up 7-1 Victory Over Canadian Team</p>
<p>(Dentsu, Philadelphia, 8th) This month is the sixth competition of the World Baseball Tournament. The results of the previous five times were: Runner-up won three times, Canadian team won two times. Today, the competition moved to Philadelphia at 1:30 PM, with the Canadian team starting the attack first. If the Runner-up team wins this game, they can regain last year's World Championship. If the Canadian team wins, the score will be tied at one to three, and a final will be needed to determine the winner. Therefore, this game is extremely important. The managers of both teams have been secretly planning a winning strategy since the day before, changing the batting order and reorganizing the lineup to face each other. The Canadian team moved right fielder Walter Kings to number three and first baseman Baumler to number six. The Runner-up team retired Haas and replaced him with the good hitter Siemens as center fielder. The newly advanced Muer was assigned as left fielder. Manager Mark also replaced left-handed Haas with right-handed Muer and changed the batting order, adopting a strong batting strategy of pressing from the front. The pitcher was again Aschmann, who won in St. Louis the day before, and the catcher was Gottschling, who had the best ball skills. On the Canadian side, the pitcher was Hallahan and the catcher was Wilson. As soon as the battle began, the Runner-up team continued to press. In the first inning and second run, Runner-up Gottschling and Muehlhaeusler both recorded a double, taking two points in one fell swoop, greatly boosting the team's morale. They added one point in the third inning. In the fourth inning, Daqus hit a home run into the outfield stands, scoring another two points. In the fifth and sixth innings, they continued to add two points, and the score gradually increased, already taking the lead. Conversely, the Canadian team only scored one point in the ninth inning. All other attempts were foiled by Aschmann's pitcher, who skillfully controlled the speed of the pitches, almost completely annihilating the Canadian team. The Runner-up team's attacking skills on this day were truly amazing. The Canadian team changed pitchers in the third, sixth, and eighth innings, striving to defend, but the Runner-up team eventually entered as if into an unmanned territory, winning every battle. They then won the World Championship again with a score of seven to one. The game ended at 4:15 PM. The score sheet for both sides is listed below:</p>
<p>Canadian Team 　　Runner-Up Team</p>
<p>○　○　○　○　○　○　○　○　One　One</p>
<p>One　Two　Three　Four　Five　Six　Seven　Eight　Nine　A One</p>

<h3>Lowa Will Compete</h3>
<p>—Decision to Participate in the Foreigners' Association, But Strength Reduced—</p>
<p>Since the Lowa football team returned to the country, whether or not it would participate in the Foreigners' Football Association has been a matter of great concern to the general public. Although the name of Lowa was repeatedly issued in the order of the Foreigners' Association, it was still marked as provisional. Yu Hengzhi and others from the Lowa Executive Committee hesitated for many days on this matter and finally decided yesterday to participate in this year's Foreigners' Association. However, since Jinan and Hujiang Universities also participated independently, all players from these two schools cannot serve for Lowa, resulting in a shortage of Lowa talent. They are currently recruiting from all sides, and the first game against the Western Police scheduled for Sunday (the 12th) had to be postponed.</p>

<h3>The China Tennis Association Wins the Championship</h3>
<p>The China Tennis Association has been open for more than a month. Because there are as many as eleven teams participating this time, and each team has to play against each other once, there are a total of 55 matches, which takes a lot of time. It was not until last Sunday that it was completed. The results of each team this year are not weak, and the team with the most points is the China team, followed by the Joy team, and the Youth Association and the Roadway team are third. According to the China team, they won the championship for two consecutive years in the first two sessions (that is, in 1925 and 1926. Because the opening was slightly late, it was not completed. The championship in 1929 was won by the Youyou team.) This year's first prize should be the Memorial Cup of Mr. Hong Xianfang. It is said that Mr. Hong intends to set up a banquet on a selected date to celebrate each team and present the silver cup to the China team, which has won the championship for three years, to show honor and leave a souvenir. The results of each team this year are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) China: 8 wins, 1 loss, 1 draw, 81 points</p>

<h3>Wu Chengyu, Attorney, Announces on Behalf of Huang Fa That Zheng Jianru et al. Must Not Use the Guangyuan Trademark</h3>
<p>It is now stated by my client, Huang Fa, that he previously hung the Guangyuan trademark in the Jiangnan Shipyard as a foreign manager to contract projects. Because the actual capital was insufficient, Cheng Ji and others were added as shareholders in the 17th year of the Republic of China with a capital of six thousand yuan, temporarily managed by Zheng Jianru. From the 17th year to the present, all profits have not been calculated or distributed. We were about to send a letter requesting calculation when, in July of this year, we received a letter from the company in the name of dismissing Huang Fa without reason. Upon investigation, the Guangyuan trademark was created by Huang Fa. The joint venture contract did not transfer it. If Huang Fa is dismissed: (1) the profits over the years should be calculated and distributed clearly first; (2) the Guangyuan trademark should be returned to Huang Fa. Zheng Jianru et al. must not use it without authorization. In addition to filing a lawsuit, please publish an announcement on our behalf. Therefore, on behalf of the announcement that from now on, no one may use the Guangyuan trademark to contract projects from the Jiangnan Shipyard without authorization. If they use Guangyuan trademark unauthorizedly, the profits obtained from contracting projects by Guangyuan trademark should belong to Huang Fa. This is a public announcement.

<h3>Venereal Disease Leukorrhea Skin Specialist Dr. Dong Huimin</h3>
<p>Dr. Dong Jun Huimin, a prominent family from Siming and a famous doctor from Yinshui, has been practicing in Shanghai for many years. His treatments and medications take into account both internal and external factors. Injections of German 6064, as well as various injections for gonorrhea, buboes, chancres, scabies, and hemorrhoids, are especially Dr. Dong's specialty. His techniques are agile and guaranteed to be painless. Therefore, all cases of syphilis that have been repeatedly treated without success, leukorrhea that flares up from time to time, or chronic leukorrhea caused by misdiagnosis, will first be examined by Dr. Dong to assess the severity of the disease and the strength of the body. The symptoms are then treated with injections, washes, electrotherapy, and medication. In mild cases, the pain will stop on the same day. In severe cases, a cure can be achieved in a very short time, with a guarantee of no recurrence and no impact on fertility. I admire Dr. Dong's benevolence and kindness. He does not consider medical expenses for poor patients. We know each other well and are familiar with his rich experience and excellent treatment methods. There is no one in the Shanghai poison sect who can surpass him. I am concerned that patients may not be able to distinguish the path and may be misled, not only wasting money but also endangering their wives and children. Therefore, I will not hesitate to provide a shortcut for all walks of life. Now, another department has been set up to specialize in body examination and poison testing, ready to solve the problem of toxicity at the time of syphilis onset, whether toxic or non-toxic, suspicious problems. All inspection drug costs and surgery fees are divided into equal parts to facilitate early treatment for those with toxicity and to avoid anxiety for those without toxicity. It is also a pleasure for us to introduce the cloud medical examples. The clinic is open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and the registration fee is only two jiao. The clinic is open from 1:00 PM to 10:00 PM, and the registration fee is one yuan and two jiao, with half price for follow-up visits. Package medical treatment is negotiable.

<h3>National Day Musings</h3>
<p>— Yang Jia Yi</p>
<p>Commemorating National Day. There is a difference between genuine and fake. Those who genuinely commemorate National Day value the significance of commemorating National Day. Those who falsely commemorate National Day focus on superficial actions, such as meetings and entertainment.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Zhihui, the inventor of the Double Tenth Festival, once said, "If we were to use the fervent spirit with which we celebrate National Day to conduct our affairs, our affairs would undoubtedly succeed." How sincere and insightful his words are.</p>
<p>Lovers also regard National Day as a good opportunity for secret trysts. Therefore, what they celebrate on National Day is not the nation's celebration but their own private celebration.</p>
<p>Do not underestimate the cost of celebrating National Day. This extravagance is an unexpected windfall for paper goods stores and lantern shops.</p>
<p>National Day is such a great day that we should reflect on the ardent spirit of sacrifice with which our martyrs shed their blood. It is not enough to simply hold a meeting and perform some entertainment.</p>
<p>The same National Day commemoration is seen differently by people in relatively peaceful areas, who should celebrate enthusiastically to express joy for National Day, and by people in war-torn areas, who can only sigh at National Day.</p>
<h3>The Nineteenth National Day</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>The deity of National Day, following in the footsteps of Mr. Earth, has completed a 365-day journey around the sun and returned to its old place, once again receiving the welcome of the masses. The gun-wielding class raises guns in salute, which is a celebration. The pen-wielding class waves pens in salute, which is also a celebration. Mr. Guan Chengzi takes off his hat, drinks his fill of ink, and dances nimbly on the jade paper, waiting to say something. Should he say some hopeful words? The optimistic gentlemen have already said them. Should he say some complaints? The pessimistic gentlemen have already said them. Should he associate the characters of "Double Tenth" with the names of important figures? The character-splitting gentlemen have already said them. Should he write a future record of National Day thirty or fifty years from now? The fortune-telling gentlemen have already said them. Should he write a fable about how Mr. Hua's life will be long or short? The idealist gentlemen have already said them. A friend said, "No, no. These are all general articles. They are all articles like a blue cloth long gown. They can be worn over a single robe, a lined robe, a cotton robe, or a leather robe. This year's National Day can be like this, and next year's National Day can be like this." I think that the National Day article of a certain year should be specified for a certain year and should never be written in a common phrase. In the past, people often used the lunar zodiac as material. Now it is not applicable. This year's National Day of the nineteenth year of the Republic should originate from the characters "nineteen and two." In ancient times, the records about the characters "nineteen and two" always had the hope of success. Duke Chong'er achieved hegemony because of his nineteen years of hardship. Su Wu returned from herding sheep because of his nineteen years of unwavering integrity. Butcher Tan effortlessly wielded his knife because he had solved nineteen cattle one morning without dulling the blade. Mr. Mao's few words determined success because nineteen mediocre people achieved success by relying on others. These many beautiful stories about the characters "nineteen and two" are all good materials for this year's National Day celebration article. I said, "How about next year's National Day?" The friend said, "The topic of the twentieth National Day is even easier to write. The twentieth year is the year of Double Tenth. Double Ten years meet Double Ten Festival, which is Double Double Ten. By next year, I will have a good article to publish. You wait and see."</p>
<h3>A Retrospective on the Nineteenth National Day</h3>
<p>— Wu Xiaohou</p>
<p>The Republic of China has been born for nineteen years. In these nineteen years, feudal evil forces, Hongxian warlords, and communist reactionaries have emerged one after another. Some have held military and political power, while others have taken the opportunity to steal it. Wars and disturbances have continued, and there has been no peaceful day. The people's livelihood has been exhausted, disasters have been frequent, and the national strength has been weak, almost to the point of collapse. Recalling the autumn of the Xinhai Revolution, when Wuhan called out, the whole country responded. Scholars threw down their pens to join the army, and women also abandoned their needles to fight the enemy. Beauties rode peach blossom horses, and students wielded willow leaf swords. The people were of one mind and achieved the goal of a republic. At that time, I also led a student army in Shanghai and personally braved arrows and stones in the ranks. When Yuan Shikai declared himself emperor, I wrote an article denouncing Yuan, which was first published in the Lijing Magazine of Soochow University and then reprinted in various newspapers in Shanghai. It attracted the attention of Yuan's intelligence agencies, and I almost suffered misfortune. I changed my clothes and name (originally named Pin San, later changed to the current name) and was escorted to Shanghai by an American professor from Soochow University, which saved me from the disaster. In the fifteenth year, the National Revolutionary Army advanced straight down the Yangtze River from the Pearl River Basin. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek fought between Hubei and Jiangxi. I also assisted the Thirty-third Army in military affairs. When Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang expressed their loyalty to the Central Government, I worked in the capital, hoping that the period of military government would come to an end and that the period of tutelage government would gradually reach constitutional government, so that the country would be as stable as a rock and the people's livelihood would be as solid as a mulberry tree. Unexpectedly, in the autumn of the eighteenth year, I received a document from the Ministry of Interior of the National Government to go to the East to inspect municipal administration. After the inspection in Tokyo was completed, on the way from Yokohama to Kobe, I suddenly learned the news of Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang's rebellion. The Japanese newspapers, which had always been in the business of fabricating rumors about our country's political affairs, spread the news widely, and the wind was blowing before the storm. Those living in foreign countries almost did not know the chaotic situation in the country. Recently, Zhang Xueliang of Guanwai, observing the external environment and internal timing, obeyed the Central Government and raised his arms, and Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang's entire army were wiped out. From then on, peace was in sight and unification was expected. Our country's old laws stipulate that men are capped at the age of twenty and women are married at the age of twenty. This year is the Double Tenth National Day of the nineteenth year. Nineteen years ago, I was still a child and had not yet come of age. All measures were inevitably confused and chaotic. Nineteen years later, I will be a fully grown adult. I will see the transformation from tutelage government to constitutional government, bringing order to the people and things, gradually entering a prosperous road, stabilizing the people's livelihood, developing civil rights on the right track, and enhancing the nation's position in the international arena. The rain of transformation and nurturing will come in due season. I will see the gradual attainment of the goal of great harmony through the Three Principles of the People, so that all the nations in the world illuminated by the sunlight will be disciples of our Premier. Then, offering melons in the backyard, whispering sweet nothings on beautiful nights, holding hands by the water's edge, and leisurely wandering on auspicious days, drinking water and thinking of the source, this Double Tenth National Day of the nineteenth year will surely be imprinted in the hearts of everyone.</p>
<h3>National Day Memories</h3>
<p>— Ms. Lü Dihua</p>
<p>Li Shixiao Nan was a well-known figure in literary circles in Hunan. He taught at Fuxiang Women's Middle School in Changsha during the ninth and tenth years of the Republic of China. At that time, I was also studying at this school. Mr. Li always asked the students to write songs on National Day, each expressing their feelings. I still remember Mr. Li's own writing, "Just passed the Mid-Autumn Festival, today is the Double Tenth Festival again. How many festivals are there? Every family celebrates the Republic. The Republic is truly happy. After singing, we must cry. Singing and crying are always connected. Looking back eleven years." Reflecting on the past and comparing it to the present, I cannot help but feel emotional. War has been seen many times in the past eight years, and banditry has been frequent. Now, fortunately, the war is about to end. I only hope that banditry will be eliminated soon and that we can engage in construction to make China rich and strong. This is how I celebrate National Day.</p>
<h3>New National Day Recipes</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>During this National Day festival, after racking my brains, I found several new recipes in the corners of my stomach. I am willing to give up patent rights and write them out to tell the Free Talk, as a National Day gift.</p>
<p>Double Tenth Cake: Made with glutinous rice flour. No filling is necessary in the middle. The surface is powdered with pink powder and printed into a Double Tenth pattern using a mold. The Double Tenth is the day when our Chinese compatriots broke away from the Manchu Qing autocratic government. Eating Double Tenth cake means never forgetting the Double Tenth National Day.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen Soup: Sun Yat-sen soup does not use soy sauce to show Sun Yat-sen's integrity. It is made with four flavors: sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy, because Sun Yat-sen tasted all the sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy flavors in his life and was able to have a great fearless spirit to make the revolution successful. Eating Sun Yat-sen soup can also make us persevering and fight evil forces to the end, and have a great fearless spirit.</p>
<p>Blue and White Noodles: The national flag and party flag of China both have a blue sky and white sun. The so-called blue and white noodles are made by cooking noodles with green vegetables. After they are made, their color is interspersed with blue and white, which is suitable for matching the party and national flags. Eating blue and white noodles means loving peace and guarding oneself like jade.</p>
<p>Masses Dumpling: The Masses Dumpling is made with rice flour and does not need to be filled. Sun Yat-sen said that the Chinese nation is a sheet of loose sand. If we cannot unite in the future, we will not be able to resist imperialism. Eating Masses Dumplings can unite the masses to resist all external oppression.</p>
<p>Three Principles Zongzi: The Three Principles Zongzi is made of glutinous rice, with three kinds of fillings in the middle. Both sweet and salty are acceptable. The shape is triangular to represent the Three Principles of the People: Nationalism, Democracy, and People's Livelihood. Most Chinese people have not yet understood the Three Principles of the People. Eating Three Principles Zongzi can enable the masses to understand the Three Principles of the People and save China.</p>
<p>Five Powers Bun: The Five Powers Bun is made with flour and filled. Sweet or salty is acceptable. It is made into a pentagonal shape to represent the five powers. Eating Five Powers Buns allows the masses to know the implementation of the Five-Power Constitution and exercise the four major civil rights to implement democracy.</p>
<p>Unity Porridge: Cooked with 400 million grains of rice to represent 400 million people who can unite and work together to face the outside world. Eating Unity Porridge can enable 400 million compatriots to unite and overthrow imperialism, support small and weak nations, and realize nationalism.</p>
<p>Finished. Please, readers, accept this meager gift generously and try it out according to the law.</p>
<h3>Interesting Anecdotes by the Wine Bottle</h3>
<p>— Drunken Madman</p>
<p>Some days ago, my friend Yang invited me to drink at his humble residence. For a time, wolves and tigers gathered, and we enjoyed ourselves immensely. Later, the host proposed that each person tell a joke or interesting anecdote, and the violator would be punished with a cup of wine. This led to a great uproar, and we congratulated each other with cups of wine. So, we each displayed our ingenious thoughts, and humorous remarks emerged. Some were enough to make people spit out their rice. Here, I have extracted a few anecdotes for your amusement. However, the interesting history of the drunken countryside accounts for two of them. They still do not depart from the true colors of a drunkard.</p>
<p>Went for a Year: Mr. Liu, who was at the party, said that one day he was passing by the Eight Immortals Bridge in the French Concession. There was a barber carrying a burden, shaving someone's head by the roadside. Just as he was waving his hands and sending his eyes off, engaged in the work of the upper class, two Western constables suddenly arrived and sternly drove him away. The barber hurriedly carried his burden and fled. Mr. Jia was stunned like a wooden chicken. His fine head had just been shaved halfway. The constables and onlookers all laughed loudly. Mr. Jia ran away in a panic, covering his head, probably tracking down the barber to find a suitable place to continue his work. Many pedestrians who saw this strange head were still puzzled. Although the Western constables seemed to be playing a prank, it was interesting.</p>
<p>Come Again: A certain gentleman said that when he lived in a certain neighborhood in the French Concession, he encountered a rare interesting anecdote. The houses in the neighborhood were arranged in a row, all single buildings, commonly known as Western houses. Most of the residents were small families. Opening the door, you could see the bed. Mr. Jia and Mr. Yi lived next to each other. One night, Mr. Jia returned home drunk. His drunken state was blurred. He mistakenly knocked on Mr. Yi's door. Mr. Yi heard the knock and opened the door. The lamp on the table suddenly went out in the wind. Mrs. Yi did not recognize the truth and mistook him for her husband. She scolded in a low voice, "I told you to drink less. Why are you so drunk again?" Mr. Jia entered and groped his way onto the bed. Mrs. Yi lit the lamp again to do her needlework. Before long, she suddenly heard another knock on the door. Mrs. Yi asked in surprise, "Who is it?" The answer was clearly Mr. Yi. Mrs. Yi was greatly frightened. She hurriedly opened the curtain and looked closely. The person sleeping soundly was clearly Mr. Jia from next door. She was extremely flustered and did not know what to do. She hurriedly pulled the bolt. Mr. Yi entered the room. Mrs. Yi told him about the magpie's nest being occupied by a dove. Mr. Yi was filled with anger, but because Mrs. Yi had not yet fallen asleep and he was convinced by her usual behavior, he did not suspect her of unfaithfulness. So, he dragged Mr. Jia up and rebuked him, "I won't even allow others to snore next to my bed. How could you be my guest in my room? Fortunately, the person in bed was not yet asleep, otherwise, wouldn't I be even more ashamed?" Mr. Jia rubbed his drunken eyes and repeatedly admitted that he was wrong. He staggered away. The most interesting thing was that Mr. Jia's wife heard about the incident and suspected that Mr. Jia was having an affair with Mrs. Yi. Her jealousy burst forth. After Mr. Jia vehemently denied it, the interesting play came to an end.</p>
<p>Young Swordsman Sees Him Off: My friend Mr. Niu has always been fond of alcohol. One night, he was drinking in the north of the city. Since his home was in Xinzha, he took the tram home. At that time, he was already drunk. Then he suddenly fell asleep. When the tram arrived at Gordon Road, the ticket seller called him but he did not respond. A young man saw that he was well-dressed and looked like an elder, so he woke him up and helped him off the tram. He also asked him for his address and escorted him home. Mr. Niu's wife immediately rebuked the young man, "You young people, why don't you show more understanding and let him get so drunk?" The young man said that they were strangers who had just met and were not acquainted. He only pitied him for traveling at night and facing many dangers, so he accompanied him home. Mrs. Niu was ashamed and thanked him. The young man also took his leave. Mr. Niu said that such an ancient and chivalrous young man is hard to find in this era. It is a pity that he did not ask his name and address.</p>
<p>Acknowledgement and Introduction: My Wu Guanyide is a famous painting master. He used to be a professor of traditional Chinese painting at Ningbo Provincial Middle School and achieved remarkable results. Recently, he resigned from his job and stayed at home to focus on painting because there were many people asking him for paintings. All the major paper fan stores in Shanghai collect his works on his behalf, receiving dozens of pieces every day. Yesterday, I was honored to receive a Waterfall Viewing Painting from him, which was detached from vulgarity and was truly extraordinary. I would like to express my gratitude here and also introduce him. (Shou Juan)</p>
<h3>The Night of National Day</h3>
<p>— Fan Jugao</p>
<p>Time flies so fast. The lovely Double Tenth Festival is here again. Thinking back to last year's National Day, I still remember it very clearly. It still has a delightful aftertaste. That night, our town held a grand lantern parade. All sectors of society participated. Because I wanted to have a delicate lantern, I came up with my own idea and made it out of paper and bamboo. However, my handwork is not very good, and I have never studied at Qiao Linglong for three years, so it became a lantern that looked like nothing in particular. It was rectangular, like the ones used by fortune tellers on the street. Because I made it myself and put a lot of effort into it, I was very happy to hold it. Although the people on the road who saw it laughed at it, nine and a half out of ten, I still "let them laugh and scold, I will carry my good lantern myself." I went to the competition and returned home, giving it to my daughter Hualing. She was very happy and thought it was the most beautiful and ingenious lantern in the world. She loved it as if it were a treasure. I felt even more pleased.</p>
<p>On the parade route, the lanterns of the primary school students often went out. There were many reasons why they went out. One was that they were blown out by the wind. Another reason was that the nails for inserting candles were crooked. They carried dim and dark lanterns and often looked sad, asking me to light them for them. I anticipated that I would have this task, so when I left, I put several paper blowers in my bag, like the ones used to put water pipes in the theater. As soon as I received their requests, I immediately lit them with them, not willing to let their lanterns be dark for a long time, which would make the lantern carriers unhappy. But as soon as one was lit, another went out. I had to light the east and light the west. More than two hundred children were being lit by us three or four colleagues, and we were so busy that we almost had to lift our feet. Not only were we so busy, but there was also another kind of suffering. Our fingers were burned a lot by the candle flames. At that time, we were in a good mood and enjoyed it. When we rested at home the next day, we stretched out our ten fingers to look at them and were almost scared stiff. It turned out that the red and white candle oil was all over our fingers, and the burn blisters were all over our fingers. On closer inspection, it looked like a battlefield map. Alas. Why don't we take such suffering as a sad thing, but instead feel happy about it? It's all because everyone has a love for the country. The situation is peaceful and the four directions are peaceful, so we hold such a grand lantern parade. We are a part of the nation and should celebrate with revelry, singing and dancing, and forget all the pain. Now, the National Day of the nineteenth year is here again. I hope to burn my ten fingers a few times again, just like last year. At the same time, I hope that the war on the front line will end soon and that we will be able to have permanent peace, so that all the people of China can enjoy the blessings of peace. Then, wouldn't it be even more fun to hold a grand lantern parade every year today?</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Financial and Gold Market Still in a Weak State</h3>
<p>Fickle Market Sentiment: Yesterday, the 9th, the gold price continued its downward trend, but there were signs of hidden strength. Fluctuations of about three to four taels were seen, with a total difference of over five taels in the overall market. Investor confidence was weak, and foreign exchange showed slight signs of loosening. Bank transactions were uneven, and trading among various firms in the market was quite active. However, buying and selling varied significantly. In the morning session, Zhifeng, Yongfu, Chang, and the Dalian group were buying, while Dadecheng, Shengda, and Taixing were mostly selling short. As for large silver bars, they showed a renewed decline. Initially, there was a rise, but strong selling pressure quickly reversed the trend, leading to a sharp fall of five taels. From morning to noon, price fluctuations were due to unstable supply and demand, causing volatility. In the afternoon, there were no significant changes. Dadecheng and arbitrageurs sold, while Zhifeng, Yongshun, Liyuan, and Yongcheng bought. The price fluctuated by only one or two taels. However, a strong, slow decline was evident, with the final price standing outside of 66 taels. Today is National Day, and both the silver and money industries are closed for the holiday, so the gold market will likely also take a break.</p>
<p>Volatile Morning Session: The opening price for November gold futures rose by 1 tael and 2 qian to 569.8 taels. Silver bars shrank by one-sixteenth, and the silver price shrank by one-eighth. The British-Japanese exchange rate increased by one-thirty-second. European markets were active, while the New York market saw selling. Investor confidence was still positive, and Yongheng, Shengda, and others offered supply, causing a drop of four to five taels. The preliminary fixing was around 65 taels. With the price of British gold stabilizing, Taiwan Zhengjin also bought in December gold at 7 bian 74375 and January at 7 bian shi ban. Fuchang, Zhifeng, and Yong followed suit, driving the price up by more than 3 taels to 68 taels 67 qian at 10:30 AM. Later, Dadecheng and Xinheng tended to sell, and the market turned stable to bearish, with a sudden and drastic fall of 4 taels. By 11:30 AM, it had dropped to 64.5 taels, then rebounded by 1 tael to 5 taels 56 qian, before falling again to within 5 taels. At the noon close, the price was 65.1 taels, with continued heavy trading around 5 taels 5 qian. The quoted price remained at 621 taels, initially pressing to 55-56 taels, then later to 53 taels. At noon, it was still suppressed to just below 56 taels.</p>
<p>Calm Afternoon Session: The afternoon session opened at 66 taels, then fell to 65 taels 67 qian. News of a slight rebound in the Indian exchange rate by one or two annas pushed the price to 66 taels 34 qian. Zhifeng, Yong, and others bought slightly. The exchange market stabilized. Sumitomo offered December Japanese gold at 1 tael 2 qian 5 fen 875, and HSBC offered British gold at 7 bian shi 4375. Later, Dadecheng and others sold, causing a decline of 1 tael and 0. The price was 5 taels 12 qian at 2:30 PM, then Mitsubishi absorbed January British gold at 7 bian shi ban. Yuancheng, Yongfuxing, and Yong came to buy, so by 2:00 PM, the price was 67 taels 12 qian, with fluctuations of about 1 tael. Later, HSBC sold November gold at 7 bian shi 4375, which was absorbed by Holland and Belgium. However, arbitrageurs in the market mostly sold, and around 4:00 PM, the price was suppressed to 66 taels 3 qian. At the 4:30 PM close, the price was 66 taels 6 qian, a drop of 2 taels compared to the previous day. It was further suppressed to around 6 taels. The highest price during the day was 69.8 taels, and the lowest was 64.5 taels, a difference of 5.3 taels. Looking back at the quoted price, it pressed to around 55 taels. The account books showed 69 taels for this month, 65 taels for next month, a water supplement of 69 taels, and 71 taels in the afternoon. Item prices were 9 taels 7 qian in the early morning, 5 taels 5 qian at noon, 6 taels in the afternoon, and 6 taels at the close.</p>
<p>Active Trading: The trading volume of various firms was as follows: Zhifeng, Yong, Fuchang, Hengxing, Shunli, and Wanxing all bought in. Yuancheng, Yong, and Dadecheng sold, with more sellers than buyers. Xinheng and Yuancheng roughly broke even with about 2,000 large silver bars. Taixing, Shengda, and Taikangrun all bought in, totaling about 3,300 silver bars. Yu Da, Yongkang, and Yongfeng had fluctuating buy and sell volumes. In the afternoon, Yuancheng, Yongfuxing, Shunli, and Zhifeng all bought in, while Dadecheng, Yuancheng, Yong, and Yu Da all sold. There were also some retail investors with limited buying and selling. The Dalian group sold 500-600 silver bars and bought in more than 1,000. The Guangdong group sold about 2,000 silver bars, reportedly to consume drafts.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Softened Following the Gold Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver market suddenly saw a decline, but trading was still active. The British-American exchange rate rose and fell slightly, with British-Japanese rates rising and American-Japanese rates unchanged. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged, initially stable internally but then weakened, turning stable in the afternoon. However, there was no significant fluctuation, and it eventually seemed weak. Compared to the previous morning, British gold increased by 0.0625, American gold increased by 0.125, and Japanese gold decreased by 0.25, likely due to the continued softening of the gold price, divergent supply and demand, and declining investor confidence. However, trading among Chinese foreign exchange speculators was still considerable. The trading volume of British gold was over 100,000 pounds, with banks like Zhengjin, Taiwan, and Mitsubishi buying in, and HSBC, Anda, Wangyou, and Huabi selling out. Gold businesses mostly hedged gold. American gold trading among various banks was over 100,000 yuan. The Dalian group sold tens of thousands of yuan worth of Japanese exchange, which was absorbed by Zhengjin and Korea. Various firms also settled 100,000-200,000 yuan, with Sumitomo selling. However, the market was still fluctuating, and investor confidence was uncertain.</p>
<p>British Exchange Rate: The domestic market fluctuated only by 0.0625. In the early morning, the asking price for October and November was the same at 1 shilling 7 bian shi 3125, and for December and January, it was 375. The buying price increased by 0.0625, and the swap spread narrowed. In the early morning, Zhengjin bought 10,000 pounds for January at 7 bian shi 4375.

The buying price increased by 0.125. At the noon close, the near term was $39.25, and the far term was $39.375. In the afternoon, Anda and Shanghai traded $50,000 for October at $39.3125.

<h3>Silver Prices Declined Consistently in Britain and America</h3>
<p>According to a London telegram yesterday, the price of large silver bars declined slightly again. Chinese banks in London sold, while speculators bought, and the market was strong. After the close, New York sold, so the market turned stable. Both near and far terms declined by 0.0625, the same as 16.5 pence (equivalent to British gold at 1 shilling 7 bian shi 5). According to a New York telegram, the American silver price also declined by 0.125 to 35.75 cents. The British-American exchange rate increased by 0.03125 to $4.859875.

<h3>Auxiliary Currency Rates Trending Downward</h3>
<p>Market Overview: Recently, the foreign auxiliary currency market has been trending downward due to a surge in supply from other ports. The difference in market prices over the past week has reached a significant 0.5 fen. Comparing prices over the past two to three weeks shows a difference of no less than 0.7-0.8 li. Fortunately, the decline has been gradual and not exhausting, so it has not attracted the attention of outsiders and is unlikely to cause any unexpected changes. Those maintaining the market are able to adjust surpluses and shortages, so there should be no major disturbances.</p>
<p>Auxiliary Currency Rates: (Foreign Auxiliary Currency) The morning price was 7 qian 2 fen 8 li, and the afternoon price was 7 qian 2 fen 7 li 2 hao and half. The result was a total drop of 1 li 3 hao and 7 hu and half compared to the previous day's afternoon price. Supply was still competitive, so the trend was still expected to be downward. (Silver Auxiliary Currency) The morning price was 0.3 fen higher than the previous morning, at 1 qian 5 fen. However, news of many speculators in the afternoon caused the market to loosen, and the silver auxiliary currency fell back to 0.7 fen. Banks listed the price at 0.6 fen. Due to the loosening market, there was no need to add water to the markup, and it was simply erased.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: The prices for small Jiangnan silver coins were the same in both the morning and afternoon sessions, at 6 qian 5 fen 1 li and half, a drop of a small 0.15 li compared to the previous day. Trading volume was limited, with 6,000 jiao traded in the morning session and only 2,000 jiao in the afternoon session.

<h3>Securities: News of Efforts to Reorganize the 96 Bonds in June</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a sudden surge of 2.5 yuan</p>
<p>Today is National Day, and securities trading is suspended. Yesterday, spot market trading remained thin. The futures market was calm in the morning, with slightly more activity in the afternoon. Bond prices were generally stable, but the 96 bonds suddenly experienced a significant change. News of efforts to reorganize the bonds caused a sudden increase in demand, and the market price steadily rose with each transaction. The afternoon surge was particularly strong, resulting in a gain of 2.5 yuan compared to the previous day. This change was unexpected. Other bonds seemed more sluggish, fluctuating throughout the day, with only slight gains or losses compared to the previous day, mostly by a few jiao. The total trading volume for spot transactions was 17,000 yuan, and for futures transactions, it was over 8.6 million yuan. Internal troop reduction and disbandment bonds accounted for a significant portion of the volume. Customs duty 19 bonds were stable, and 96 bonds performed better, while other bonds saw limited trading.</p>

<h3>Unfavorable Cotton Yarn Sales, Weak Auction Yarn</h3>
<p>Although Third-Grade Yarn Rose... Auction Yarn Still Fell by Two Points</p>
<p>The yarn market was sluggish due to the lack of a significant recovery in spot yarn sales after the holiday and continued weakness overseas. Although third-grade yarn rebounded by two to three yuan, most investors were concerned about overproduction due to slow spot sales, so the Chao gang aggressively sold, causing the market to loosen again. Although one factory did not relax its efforts, the overall situation was difficult to escape a weak state. In short, weak spot sales made it difficult for market prices to rise.</p>
<p>Chao gang Auction Yarn Sold 2,000 Bales: Auction yarn opened lower due to the slight rise in American cotton, but investor sentiment remained weak. There was a lack of buyers in the market, and prices fell by four, five, seven, eight, and nine qian. In the afternoon, the Chao gang sold over 2,000 bales, and market prices fell by another one to two qian. The total trading volume for the day was 14,300 bales. Xiesheng sold 2,650 bales, and Yiyu sold 800 bales, with other sellers selling 300-500 bales. Daji bought 700 bales, and Shenchang bought 600 bales, with other buyers buying 300-400 bales. The closing prices for auction yarn are recorded below:</p>
<p>Auction Yarn Price, Rise/Fall, Account Balance: Closing Price, Rise/Fall, Account Balance</p>
<p>October 1523: Down 2, 29,550. January 1513: Down 10, 33,650</p>
<p>November 1517: Down 7, 38,950. February 1517: Down 8, 22,950</p>
<p>December 1514: Down 8, 38,110. March 1523: Down 4, 3,250</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Statistics Less Than 1,000 Bales: Spot yarn sales were flat. Various gangs bought a total of 945 bales, and fellow merchants bought 25 bales. Market conditions were flat. Customers from Sichuan bought 160 bales, inland regions bought 175 bales, Yunnan bought 160 bales, Qingdao bought 50 bales, Xiamen bought 145 bales, Hankou bought 130 bales, and other gangs bought 70 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Consistently Trending Downward</h3>
<p>The cotton market is declining due to a further increase of over 100,000 bales in American cotton production. Although prices rose slightly, investor sentiment in Shanghai was weak, as they had been holding out for a long time. Seeing that American cotton was weak and showing no signs of recovery, they sold off their holdings, causing market prices to fall. However, the Han gang held firm, and many inland gangs remained unmoved, so the price decline was not severe. Factories showed no interest in purchasing spot cotton, and the future of the cotton market was not optimistic. However, a portion of farmers in rural areas were unwilling to sell at low prices, so there may be a small rebound temporarily.</p>
<p>Han Standard Broke Through the Two Tael Mark: The Han standard opened with flat investor sentiment due to the slight rise in American cotton. Selling pressure was stronger, and prices fell by two to three qian. In the afternoon, some short sellers covered their positions, causing a rebound of 0.5 fen. The total trading volume for the day was 56,200 dan. Lichang sold 6,700 dan, and Tianchang sold 4,000 dan, with other sellers selling 1,000-2,000 dan. Hengda bought 800 dan, Yuanda bought 3,700 dan, Xincheng bought 2,800 dan, Shenchang bought 2,300 dan, and Tianlong bought 2,700 dan, with other buyers buying 1,000-2,000 dan. The closing prices for the Han standard are recorded below:</p>
<p>Han Standard Closing Price, Rise/Fall, Account Balance</p>
<p>October 3200: Down 25, 75,700. January 3110: Down 25, 104,100</p>
<p>November 3180: Down 25, 104,200. February 3170: Down 25, 72,600</p>
<p>December 3170: Down 25, 101,900. March 3185: Down 20, 17,500</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Indian Cotton Re-Emerging: Spot cotton business remained slow, and there were rumors of particularly low-priced Indian cotton. Shenxin and Yong'an re-emerged as major buyers. However, the market prices and bale quantities were unknown. Transactions of local cotton were increasingly sluggish. A customer bought 300 bales of Yaohua cotton at 31 taels 4 qian, and there were warehouse transactions of 2,300 bales of Yaohua cotton and 430 bales of Tonghua cotton.</p>

<h3>Overseas Cotton Yarn Prices Mostly Rose</h3>
<p>The U.S. Cotton Government Report Favored Short Positions: Yesterday, the U.S. Cotton Government Report favored sellers, but this was offset by short covering and buying by industry players. Futures prices rose by six to eight points, and spot prices rose by five points. British cotton futures fell by one to two points, and spot prices fell by five points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by fifteen points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded below: (Telegram from the 8th)</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Uneven and Sluggish</h3>
<p>Today's National Day, All Markets are Closed</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, over 20 rice boats arrived from various gangs. Sales were initially slow but then improved. New japonica rice was extremely stagnant in the morning, and prices continued to soften. Later, due to the National Day holiday, retailers' intentions to buy improved, and high-quality rice prices stabilized, opening at 17 yuan 7 jiao. Medium-quality rice showed a slight uptick, but this was not the official market. Arrivals of thin indica rice gradually increased, and prices fell by another half yuan, with top-quality rice opening at 16 yuan 45 jiao. Duzi Xian rice in the main street of the market was still in demand, with a less abundant supply, and prices did not rise or fall. Yangjianbu and Jiantian rice were not selling well. Although the supply was not large, due to weak investor sentiment, prices fell by two to three jiao. Arrivals of Ke Xian rice were frequent, but sales were poor, and prices fell by three to four jiao. Gaobai Xian rice opened at 13 yuan on the left side of the pass, and large quantities also trended downward. All types of Xian rice were generally sluggish. Dongxin japonica rice factory inventory was not high, and the market was stable, with high-quality rice opening at 15 yuan 78 jiao. Bian Yuan was stable, and old rice was at 17 yuan 5 jiao, with new rice at 15 yuan 0. Conditions were neither good nor bad, and Yin Yuan also went from weak to flat, with extremely lackluster trading.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, 20-30 boats arrived. Sales in the main street were weak. Broken japonica rice was still arriving sporadically, with top-quality opening at 17 yuan 0. Medium-quality new japonica rice, such as goods from Sudong and Kunshan, had a steady supply, but buying sentiment was sluggish, and prices weakened. Large quantities fell by a small two to three jiao. The South Gang's thin indica rice from various kilns continued to decline. Market conditions were dull and lifeless, and prices fell by three to four jiao, with large quantities opening at 15 yuan 56 jiao. Tongbian Yin Yuan followed arrivals and was sold off, with market conditions similar to the previous day. Yangdu Xian rice softened by a jiao. Changbang's high-quality rice opened at 12 yuan 34 jiao. New factory-milled Xian rice sales were not smooth, and rural areas also watched and waited, so prices continued to decline by a small amount, with top-quality rice at 10 yuan 08-09 jiao.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Gang Suddenly Bought Near-Term Flour</h3>
<p>Market Improved Slightly in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, after the flour market opened, prices for each month generally fluctuated, similar to the previous day. However, in the afternoon session, due to frequent purchases of near-term months by the Tianjin gang, or some purchases of spot goods from factories, investor confidence was stabilized. Far-term months also showed some improvement due to the near-term months. However, foreign wheat quotations were still down by two, three, or four jiao, so while investor confidence was stable, the trading volume was particularly sluggish. Without strong sales in the spot market, there is unlikely to be excessive price increases. As a result, this month through December rose by 0.75 li, January rose by 0.5 li, February rose by 0.75 li, and March rose by 1.25 li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Rose Sharply After Falling</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, when the wheat futures market opened, prices for each month were lower by one or two fen compared to the previous day due to lower foreign wheat quotations. However, due to the inspection fee issue for this month's short positions, which has not yet been decided, industry players connected to the production areas have all telegraphed to temporarily stop loading, inevitably leading to a lack of supply. As a result, investor sentiment improved, and they continued to cover their positions. The highest price for this month rebounded to 4 taels 7 qian 1 fen, a difference of as much as 9 fen compared to the opening price. Far-term months also continued to be covered by short sellers, and new long positions showed some courage, appearing bullish. As a result, this month rose by 6 fen compared to the previous day, November rose by 3 fen, December and January rose by 2 fen, and February rose by 3 fen</p>
<h3>New Transaction of 1,000 Bags of Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of Ke Xian rice was not abundant. However, merchants from Jianbang, outside the town and villages, suddenly began purchasing. The market situation immediately showed a turning point, and the price rebounded by five to six fen. A total of 500 bags of Jiangxi Ji early rice were transacted at a price of ten yuan and nine jiao to three jiao. Another 76 bags of Ji Yuan rice were transacted at a price of fifteen yuan. Additionally, 300 bags of Nanjing rough rice were transacted at a price of eight yuan to eight yuan and one jiao. Since arriving in port a few days ago, foreign rice had not found a buyer. Yesterday, sales began with a special grade No. 1 Saigon rice (i.e., Annam glutinous rice) of 1,000 bags, priced at fourteen yuan, five jiao, and seven fen. Ordinary and second-grade Saigon rice still remain unsold.</p>
<h3>Tea News After the Reopening of Russian Firms in the Silk and Tea Market</h3>
<p>In the tea market of foreign firms in this port, business has been slightly brisk in recent days due to the revival of sales by Russian firms. The number of boxes of Gongxi green tea and Ningzhou black tea purchased by Russian firms is no less than six or seven thousand. However, since the market price of the Gongxi famous tea market has dropped, Chinese tea merchants have already suffered losses of more than twenty yuan per dan. Recently, Russian tea experts, seeing that this line of business is sufficient to manipulate the market, have again taken the opportunity to suppress prices, cancel deals, and cut prices. Insiders believe that in the future, Sino-Russian trade in tea must have a unified organization; otherwise, failure is imminent.</p>
<h3>Prices of Yellow and White Factory Oil Cakes Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, European firms were not very enthusiastic about the Shanghai white factory oil cakes, but the factory's attitude remained firm. Although transactions were difficult to increase smoothly, prices became firmer. Forty bags of December futures from Taihe and other factories were traded. European firms also need Sichuan yellow factory oil cakes, and prices are trending firmer. Twenty-five bags of wooden machine small car oil cakes from Kaili and other factories were traded, with prices rising steadily.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Thin Stock of Japanese Sugar Supports the Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's telegram from the sugar production area stated that the spot price of Cuban sugar was 1.25, an increase of 0.09375 from the previous telegram. The price of New York sugar for December was 1.20, up 2 fen; March of the next year was 1.29, up 1 fen; May was 1.37, up 3 fen; and September was 1.49, also up 1 fen. The spot price of Java sugar was 8.125, and the prices of October and November futures were both 8.00, with December at 7.875, remaining unchanged from the previous level. Trading on the exchange was very quiet. The price of new Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar was still 8 taels, with the highest at 8 taels, 1 qian, and 2.5 fen. Finely ground granulated white sugar was 8 taels, No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was 2 taels and 4 qian, and No. 8 Dutch red sugar was 6 taels, 2 qian, and 7.5 fen. The market sentiment is relatively stable. Japanese sugar N mark was 8 taels and 9 qian, J mark was 8 taels and 1 qian, SH mark was 7 taels and 7 rui and 2.5 fen, and YP mark was 8 taels, and YT mark was 7 taels and 8 qian. Demand is still smooth, but because market inventory is not abundant, the market looks quite firm.</p>

<h3>光復中華</h3>
<p>Today, nineteen years ago, is the anniversary of the Wuchang Uprising. It was because the Qing government was corrupt that Sun Yat-sen founded the Revive China Society, gathered comrades, and promoted revolution. The thinking of the people of the country underwent a transformation. Before long, there was the assassination of Governor-General De Shou by Shi Jianru, and soon after, the rebellion of Tang Caichang in Hankou, the rebellion in Datong, Anhui, the rebellion in Zhennanguan, Guangxi, and the rebellion in Hekou, Yunnan. Furthermore, Wu Yue attempted to bomb Duanfang in Tianjin, and Xu Xilin shot En Ming in Anqing. The tide of revolution grew stronger and more intense day by day. In the beginning, most party members resided in Southeast Asia, and they considered it convenient to launch uprisings from the coastal provinces. In the third month of this year, lunar calendar, because the Guangzhou uprising failed, they changed their plans and started from the Yangtze River basin. The Qing court, knowing that large quantities of military supplies were being transported in, secretly ordered the evil governor-general Rui Cheng to be extra vigilant. By the ninth day of the eighth month, Rui Cheng received a secret telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that Huang Xing had contacted party members and scheduled a meeting on the fifteenth and sixteenth to launch an uprising in Hubei, with the simultaneous coordination of the Thirtieth Brigade of Infantry. As a result, the military and all sectors became even more vigilant. However, when the appointed date arrived, there was no movement, and everyone thought that the plot had been leaked. Unexpectedly, on the night of the eighteenth, the revolutionaries' activities were exposed. In several places, successively in the Hankou Concession and at places like the Chu Xiong Building, many people such as Peng Chufan, a squad leader of the army and the military police, and female party member Long Xun Guan were arrested, and countless items such as bombs, pistols, flags, and seals were seized. Rui Cheng thought that their plot had been foiled, and was pleased that he would soon quell the rebellion, and suspected that the New Army was full of party members, wanting to investigate thoroughly. Wuchang was known to have 16,000 men in the New Army, all under the command of Zhang Biao. They had long harbored resentment, and now everyone felt endangered. Through the instigation of party members, it became uncontrollable. In the afternoon of the nineteenth, the Eighth Engineering Battalion's Left Division took the lead, using "working together with one heart" as a secret signal, tearing off their shoulder straps and tying white cloths on their left and right arms. First, they seized the armory, gathered at the parade ground, and then advanced towards the Governor's Office in three routes. The guards were unable to resist and surrendered. The next day, Rui Cheng, Zhang Biao, and others all fled. The crowd then publicly elected Li Yuanhong, the commander of the Twenty-first Mixed Brigade, as their leader, and continued to occupy Hanyang and Hankou. Subsequently, the provinces responded, and the Republic of China was established. Today, the whole country is rejoicing, looking at these pictures. Are they also remembering the difficulty of restoration and thinking about the difficulty of creation?</p>
<p>(1) After the People's Army occupied Wuchang, they patrolled the streets to maintain order. The houses destroyed on both sides were all government offices.</p>
