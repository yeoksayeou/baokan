<p>時評</p>
<h3>美英日之失業問題</h3>
<p>失業問題。今日已成爲世界各國普遍之問題。各國當局無不苦心焦慮。欲求解决此問題而不可得。即如素稱百業興隆之美國。近亦因失業工人要求救濟而生事。美國失業工人。當局承認。共有三百五十萬人。據政界估計。約有五百萬人因缺乏職業之故。外僑之願由官方資送出境者實繁有徒。移民局因經費缺乏。現僅擇處境最劣之外人資遣出境。則其嚴重可知。又據英國失業週報英人之失業者現亦有增無减。新增失業之人一萬五千。現達二百十八萬八千人云。是工黨政府雖竭盡心力。而對於救濟失業之效力。尙無所見也。又據觀察日本者云。失業恐慌。隨處可見。政府救濟之法不外借貸資本。俾得謀生。或發放賑品免致凍餒。然成效殊微。又云失業之人。每立一木架。上書履歷。置於通衢。人立其後以待招僱。其爲狀亦甚苦矣。</p>
<p>總觀以上所記。美英日之失業問題。如今尙無救濟之有效方法。而其情形又日形惡劣。今之所以尙能安然無事者。多爲强制之力。非能長久也。美英日且然。况乎其他各國乎。失業問題。誠今後世界最要問題已。</p>

<h3>慘不忍聞母女相偕白縊</h3>
<p>柳瀛洲是社會蟊賊</p>
<p>不以人類視其妻女</p>
<p>慘案發生柳猶得意</p>
<p>官廳似應加以嚴懲</p>
<p>昨晚七時半左右、南市阜民路茂興坊六號屋内發生被夫遺棄、不顧赡養、母女相偕懇樑自殺慘案、茲將詳情探錄於次、</p>
<h3>柳瀛洲變態</h3>
<p>柳瀛洲姑蘇洞庭山人、年三十六歲、向在美綸綢緞莊任司賬職、而風度翩翩、儼然一濁世佳公子也、十四年前、憑媒娶同鄕塾師周新甫之長女爲室、與柳同庚、初尚相安、詎未及一載、柳之態度忽變、可憐周氏、即被無形　棄、</p>
<p>在滬納小星　柳旣抱遺棄髮妻之念、結褵方三載、即在滬上納一甬籍虞氏（三十歲）爲小星、另賃金屋於小東門東街毯子弄六號、雙宿雙飛、早忘周氏於度外、但周氏早生一女、名運娥、今己十一齡矣、周氏初本向住洞庭鄕間、雖早聞其夫另納小星、然鄕間懦婦、祇得逆來順受、毫未加以責問、以期乃夫回心於萬一也、</p>
<p>生活幾斷絶　柳旣另有所歡、早視周氏如眼中釘、竟再接再厲、更欲作進上步離異之想、周氏遂忍舞可忍、曾於去歲舊歷二月間挈女一同來滬、賃居於大東門巡道街、然柳仍棄如敝屣、竟迄月不踵其門、於是生活幾至斷絶、所幸周氏有一胞弟名周企丰、供職於虹口保定路協興重錦綸綢廠、時常接濟、</p>
<p>曾迭次圖盡　直至去年九月二十一日、數月之間、周氏與幼女運娥共吞服金飾及火柴圖盡凡四次、均經救護出險、至九月二十一日、由企豐從中說項、柳始允按月津貼周氏十八元、並言明周氏須仍返洞庭、周氏乃率女遄返原籍、然精神上之痛苦、己不可言喻矣、</p>
<p>質衣飾殆盡　周氏返蘇後、迄至今年三月、而柳竟分文未寄、於是迫不得己、又復二次率女來申、　賃居於阜民路茂興坊六號前樓、而柳匪獨不攺前態、對周不加憐惜、且時來逼取周之衣飾典質殆盡、直欲置周氏於絶境、以迫其再返洞庭、於是慘變乃起、</p>
<p>赫然兩屍身　前日、周氏特往虹口其弟企豐家、泣訴一番、類多厭世之詞、嗣經其弟再三喻勸、送其歸家、昨日午後七時許、企豐恐生變故、特至南市探望、詎甫登樓入室、祇見房中黑暗異常、祇微見床之兩側、高懸兩物、而頻呼不應、待就近撫之、赫然乃姊與甥女兩屍身也、</p>
<p>柳方抽大煙　企豐駭極而呼、隣里畢集、迨將其放下、己均氣絶身死、企豐乃外出報告崗敬、一面遍覓瀛洲不得、乃先至小東門福昌里萬隆申莊柳父柳子靑處、亦不得要領、嗣經再三探聽、始在法租界洋行街豐記燕子窠内將柳尋獲、而柳方高臥横榻、吞雲吐霧、</p>
<p>眞毫無天良　企豐遂將柳用言誘至一區三分所、此時柳如大夢初醒、經金所長略問一過、並傳同鄰人張阿耀到所作證、又在　　上發現周氏視　之絶命書多張、詞極棲惻、令人不忍卒讀、此時記者回顧遺棄髮妻之柳瀛洲、而態度異常瀟洒、笑容可掬、若自鳴無限得意者、吁、此人眞太無良心矣、金所長訊畢、飭傳地保、候今日報請法院請騐、</p>

<h3>與討逆軍官一夕話</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>自閻馮叛變。中央興師討逆。倐己數月。至今戰事即可完全結束。前綫各軍。紛紛奏凱歸來。雙十節於國慶之外。復加以祝徢。不可謂非國事前途之好現象也。浦口車站。連日均有凱旋軍隊之足跡。而予友唐君季安。服務軍界。亦在此歡迎聲中。有事來都。征塵甫卸。爲余剪燭話汴鄭戰况。因節述其言。以饗讀者。</p>
<p>陜馮志在死守。欲堅壁固壘。以勞我師。其在蘭封所築戰壕。依山爲險。廣逾數丈。深逹數尋。蜒如辰蛇。而又層次井然。相互呼應。迨中央軍猛和挺進。彼方軍心動搖。逐步退却。劉峙陳調元諸氏。均於勝後依其陣勢。作深切的視察。亦歎謂此類戰壕。防禦工程之完備。確屬我國近歲戰爭中所鮮見。不過馮雖能守。而中央軍尤善於攻。具爲主義犧牲之决以。終得於最後一戰。破其堅壕也。中央軍以善戰著。敎導師之外。尤以蔣光鼐師爲馮軍所深畏。馮之部下。數度與其接觸。每遇輒相謂曰。（好傢伙。咱們又會面了。）味其語意。實深服蔣師之再接再厲。勇往無前。蔣部士卒。多粤桂滇貴籍。轉戰數省。當之者莫不披靡云。</p>
<p>鄭州在馮軍掌握。戰端一開。其居民莫不困處危城。提心弔膽。中央飛機。時往施行政擊。逆軍無法避免。乃遍地掘穴。藉避目標。而居民之穴處者。亦所在多有。穴頗寬廣。有前後洞以資出入。並可啓閉。且爲久居悶鬱起見。亦均樹管以透空氣者。穴居生活。不殊陰暗地獄。而炸彈飛來。間因土崩地陷。遂致形成活葬。纍纍皆是。直至中央軍長驅底定。始得撥陰霾而重見天日矣。</p>
<h3>有錢的乞丐</h3>
<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>由（乞丐）兩個字。我們聯想到（没錢）。只因爲没有錢。才做乞丐。做乞丐的人。决不會有錢的。但是。事實上。有錢的人固然不會沿門乞食。然而沿門乞食的人却並不會没錢。最近從友朋談話中從西文報章中。得到了兩件十分有趣的故事。現在就寫了出來。以證明佘說之非謬。</p>
<p>中國丐婦呼奴使婢。第一件是本地風光。在上海租界的某一里中。有某姓者。租了一間客堂樓住着。家中並没男子。只有母女兩人。並雇着一個娘姨。那個娘姨姓王。是寗波人。素爲談此事者所識。據云當其初至某姓爲傭時。常以那母女兩人之晝伏夜也爲異。乃不時留心察閱。該母女兩人。平日舉動極闊綽。飲食起居。也十分講究。每日起身的時候。總在下午二三時。一到五六點鐘的模樣。母女兩人就手挾衣包。匆匆而出。非至午夜時分。决不歸來。歸來之後。嘗見母女兩人自自衣袋中出銅元銀角。累累不計其數。該娘姨遂益異之。一晚。决意尾之出。中途失其所在。無奈則惟有蹀蹀街頭。以觀究竟。行行重行行。己到南京路某大公司之側。忽見有一女丐。在娘姨之背後。百計求乞。娘姨回頭視之。乃赫然其主婦也。女丐見行者是自己家中的娘姨。亦面紅耳赤。一言不出而去。第二天。主婦就和盤托出。與娘姨商酌。請其嚴守秘密。厚培其工資。事乃罷。以丐婦而租住洋房呼奴使婢。眞是異事。</p>
<p>外國乞丐汽車洋房。第二件是外國故事。說來尤饒興趣。據最近報載。英國的利物浦。近有一人自殺於其寓所。遺有（自認書）（Ｃonfession）一通。書中說。他是一個以乞丐爲業的人。十年以來。獲利極豐。每天至少可以得數十先令在某處置有小洋房一所。早出晚歸。徘徊待頭。作無本錢而又不費心力的營業云云。則外國乞丐更寫意於上述的中國丐婦了。按此我名漢森Ｈanson。死時处僅三十六。其自殺的原因。至今還莫名其妙。同時利物浦尚有一丐。據英國慈善會的問訊部主任勃拉司氏說。每年可獲利六百至七百餘金鎊。置有洋房一宅。更自備汽車以爲公（？）餘游息之。白天爲乞丐。晚上做老爺。其生活之舒適爲任何人所不及。勃拉氏又言。同地有一靑年。己受商等敎育。初因失業。家又貧困。不能自活。就假爲歐戰時之犧牲者。出其如椽之筆。作書寄有名富豪。請救濟。結果所得殊出意外。那人從此不求正當職業，雇二書記。専司此等求乞書之繕寫。郵寄各地。每年所入。爲數殊豐。亦可爲别開生面的乞丐了。</p>
<h3>畫貓捕鼠之奇聞</h3>
<p>— 董籍</p>
<p>友自浙省來。言寗波有賈易眞者。善繪事。尤長于鳥獸。終日獨坐一室。洗律練紙慕古調色。餘無他事。一日。晚餐己畢。偶繪一貓。置諸案頭。適夜間有一鼠覓食。至案上。忽見此貓。張雅舞爪。栩栩欲活。大驚。急回頭鼠竄不料脚眄一滑。己跌入痰盂之内。蹤跳不出。竟遭溺斃。噫。該鼠之死。非死于痰盂。實簡接爲畫貓所捕也。以三國司馬氏之智勇。名稱當世。猶見木像而喪膽。况一鼠乎。因誌之。</p>
<h3>說大鼓</h3>
<p>— 老蠶</p>
<p>大鼓派别。今有京音大鼓。奉天大鼓。山東大鼓。（又名梨花大鼓）京東大鼓。（又名客大鼓）皆以地名。地方色彩極重。惟梅花大鼓以各種别調穿心。最爲後進。似天津新調。八角鼓乃滿洲人専門玩藝。其源出於旗兵凱歌。不屬大鼓一類。</p>
<p>大鼓以梨花爲最早。梨花本名犁鏵片。乃農器之碎鐵片也。農人唱農歌。利用碎廢農器。此上古擊壤扣木之遺意也。此片後用鐵工専製。今多攺用銅片。漸失本源。梨花大鼓唱者皆山東産。唱皆整本大套。今女子多唱零段矣。</p>
<p>京音大鼓自劉寳全白雲鵬等出。遂稱大鼓。講究字眼。善用嗓音。加身段表情。悉依戲劇。板用活板。脫盡窠臼。揣摩書中人神情聲口畢肖。故唱來有聲有色。入情入理。聲音之妙。一時無兩。唱寗武關戰長沙華容道等。（高亭公司均有唱片）如生龍活虎。令人眉飛色舞。眞絶技也。白雲鵬氣魄不充實。只宜風花雪月故事。</p>
<p>梨花大鼓人才。老殘游記。推崇白妞。予所見者。則李玉屏李大王堪稱能手。或嫌梨花大鼓太土氣。不知其妙在此。山東風味色彩，全在梨花大鼓中。不可不聽也</p>
<p>八角鼓人才推常澍田何質臣等。其詞章典雅者。有風雨歸舟。滑稽者有五聖朝天。翠屏山等。五聖朝天。絶妙好詞。想入非非。予極喜聽之。</p>
<p>銀幕消息　裴斯開登。在電影界中。素有冷面滑稽大王之譽。其以前主演各片。如（體育博土）（小船主）（最後之勝利）等。均曾轟動一時。而近日映於卡爾登之（優哉游哉）一片。亦復博得極佳之聲譽。最近復主演一片。日落花流水。不但笑料新奇豐富。且中有數幕。如孤舟一艘。顚撲於警濤駭浪之大海中。開登在一被狂風刮往空中之風帆上。大翻盘半。及船失火時。奮不顧身。冒火救美。船頭惡戰强徒。屢次被擲於海洋中等。均極驚心動魄。而該劇情節。亦復曲折離奇。引人人勝。今該片將於月之二十三日（星期四）。公映於巴黎大戲院云。（欣俯）</p>
<h3>羅馬美術考察記（三）</h3>
<p>— 汪亞塵</p>
<p>羅馬敎堂中之壁畫。皆以前大畫家之名作。吾人研究美術。堂特别留意。惟羅聖彼得與聖保羅兩敎堂内之壁畫。都用嵌石細上。此堂以拉飛爾畫稿嵌成之宗敎畫數十幅。其工之精。可與文藝復興期之繪畫並美。</p>
<p>建築敎堂之項。說來很有歴史。世界有三個最著名的堂項。即倫敦敎堂。巴黎之彭得翁。Pantheon及羅馬之聖彼得敎堂。此堂項。是米葛朗極羅所經營。在建築史上最有價值的。</p>
<p>堂中之銅亭下。即置聖彼得之墓。墓前築一臺。中央臨空。游人可向下望見墓門。臺之周圍。裝以油燈百餘盞。終年點着。在拿破崙以前。係眞金所製。到拿破崙雄覇歐洲時。將金燈拿去。現有得。是銅質。惟其樣有古式。銅亭之傍。有一座聖彼得之銅像。據譯者言。此像在彼得未生前三百年己有。實係希臘之名雕。後來换裝彼得之面部。不知者。都誤認爲彼得時代之物。心信徒至此像前。皆須用手摸像之脚指。現在一隻左脚上。己磨去半個脚指。摸脚指者。不過是一種迷信而己。</p>
<p>（一）彭得翁Ｐabtgeon彭得者。是一種最大之築。可譯作（聖賢祠）。因其内面皆安置古代名人之墓。此間可特筆記述者。有大畫家拉飛爾之墓。祠中置羅馬敎皇族之墳墓甚多。拉飛耳是一個畫家。亦得與皇族同葬於此。可見當時羅馬人重藝術家之風矣。</p>
<p>拉飛耳Rophael（1462-1520）於一五○八年。受羅馬法王之招。赴羅馬作Ｓistina殿堂走廊的壁畫。他是最得法皇之寵。作風是通俗内討人歡喜。一種愛的表現。使人見之有陶醉的感覺。他雖只有三七歳的短促生命。却留下許多華美的成續。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（二九九）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十五回　四廂彈涙涙惆悵紅情　一座傾心低徊綠意</p>
<p>因爲一種經濟的關係。常常使家庭廢生變態。就像殷家這位大少爺。他就傾向在母親一方面。却是爲了這個緣故。向父親去要錢。第一便要問你的用途。你的用途不正確。他就駁下來了。但是有許多用途是不便披露的。大少爺爲了這個上頭。却有些不服氣。因說倘然財政公開的說法。那就得一律公開。講到用途不明。他父親所支的欵項。何嘗報告用途。爲了這用問題。往往使一個國家。閙到議會彈劾。國民嗟怨。財政總長嚇得不敢出席。大家庭間。却也常常閙這個玩意兒。那位殷大少爺。要見好於母親。却去偵探親的行動。偵探得着一些兒事實。便來報告母親。索取賞金。起初不過爲母親出力。到後來。竟爲了謀獲獎金而去當偵探。還要告言生事。裝點出許多花頭來。那一天。殷太太得到了馬車夫根生的口供。便和伊的那位參謀大少爺商量。說我己用冒功冒過根生。他說爺爺生小房子。在白克路轉灣。你想白克路轉灣。是在什麽地方呀。大少爺道。有了白克路轉灣這五個字。就好尋了。從來偵探家第一是要有線索。有了線索。便可以憑了這個線索去尋。我現在讀了幾部福爾摩斯的偵探集。對於偵探上的學術。很有進步。包你到明天早晨。把爺爺的小房子。偵探出來。趁爺爺不在家的时候。我們帮着你去幹他一下。你道好不好　。不過我今天晚上。買了一件東西。要二百塊錢。省很到賬房裏去領。多許多麻煩。你肯付給我嗎。殷太太駡道。你這個小鬼。趁勢又要敲我的竹槓了。上月剛拿了一百四十塊去。你到底是怎麽用的。現在越開口越大了。大少爺道。不是呀。我買了一架留聲機器。送到家裏來。大家可以聽的呀。省得夜裏跑出去。每天晚上。開了留聲機聽聽。也就過去了。殷太太想。這倒是對的。買了留聲機來。大家可以聽。這個錢將來也可以出賬的。此刻正在用兵之際。小孩子喜歡買一點游玩之具。也是堂理。便給了他二百塊錢。說你旣自詡偵探學的本領好。明天早晨。你把爺爷小房子的地址和門牌號頭。一一偵探出來告訴我。大少爺拿了這二百塊錢。何嘗是去買什麽留聲機器。大槪是送到那一家堂了裏去了。但是得了權利。不能不盡此義務。這個偵緝工作是要做的。</p>

<h3>長期消息續誌</h3>
<p>近日銀錢業對於長期交易之進行　勇往直前、不遺餘力、昨聞南北市木業方面、開做情形、雙方相持尚未成交、在金融界方面、以該帮四月間做定之息價、多數爲八兩二錢半此屆轉賬旣不能略加、然最低限度照舊、（即八兩二錢半）在木業方面、僉謂今年秋間迄於目前、閩省戰禍蔓延、木材來源中斷銀欵皆無用處、徒耗利息、且照大勢情形、一時恐難恢復在此半年中、殊無恢復希望、與其空耗銀利曷若將到期長期償還如果必欲轉賬、須息價較上屆稍减、庶資略輕担負、照其口吻、最高息價祇肯八兩、否則預備還欵因此二錢半之差額、各據理由相堅持、結果沿未成交、就目光所及、恐金融界難操勝算大都不過八兩而己、又雜糧荳米帮、亦因米市隳落、營業跟難、不願賡續轉賬、皆有償還之意、故多數尚未定議　然少數己有做出、價在十兩左右但大批交易未定此戔戔小數　不能作爲標準也、</p>
<h3>證劵公債市平静如前</h3>
<p>昨日期市稍旺、計上午開出四百二十餘萬、下午約三百三十萬、合計七百五十餘萬、内一九關稅進出最旺、佔二百二十七萬、編遣亦約逹二百萬元、　兵反不及前、計一百六十餘萬、又關梲亦僅六十餘萬、其他甚清、現貨市况寥落、前後市共僅九千元、至昨各債變動、惟十九年關稅以有大户售出、雖投資收進尚不寂莫、而價較前日終爲壓低六七角續極呆定、較前日計一九捲烟期貨回漲四角、餘互有漲跌、爲數均祇在一二角間、</p>

<h3>棉市鞏固之象</h3>
<p>棉市仍平、但趨勢略挻、因美棉情勢穏定、寗波帮大批購進、多加碼頭、日商亦有扒空、揚中檯面較緊、一般散户以票準品尚未定妥、火機花增減問題漢申兩帮尚未解决、一　散户懷疑不定、多數觀望云</p>

<h3>糧食米市天陰堅穏</h3>
<p>閘北昨各檔到源四十餘號、走銷因天陰轉活、而貨主因虧耗過觀望故人心轉穏、新粳頂貨呈定、開十四元八九角而普通中關等粳則轉堅兩三角、買氣徴爽、　稻市况平庸羊秈本　問津亦殷、高開十一元三四月計喊　一角外杜尖零銷活動兼之到源　　、恐氣頗佳、開高十一元九角約提兩角、客尖特項十元埠尖十元零九角悉昻一有以上變元陰化到銷兩抵價格平平、</p>
<p>滬南昨日河到陸續三十餘號、各帮銷場清淡、常帮新粳此間到稀銷淡、價格仍開高十四元三四角　同機粳　銷略化大盤無榮辱、南帮靑項·泗涇·　種·百哥白稻市况一律轉定、價開高十三元五六角、羊秈杜秈來貨到源亦告稀</p>
<p>落、惟存貨尚可、故盤面仍守原價、南路新陰元銷場殊屬呆木、開高十三元半、</p>
<h3>粉市徘徊帶俏</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、各月份大致呈盤旋之勢、本月份初以浮多回出人心稍疲、繼以大廠家之態度梢緊、將來之交割、當較前月份爲稀、並以存底不豐、恐非仍到三錢關口不可、十一月份初亦見疲、後則跟俏、至十二月份因倒掛太巨、市勢殊俏、餘則均屬平定、觀後步如小廠所定之洋　不能即到、前途一遇銷活、尚看好角、結果本月份未動、十一月份好二厘半、十二月份好二分、一月份好七厘半、二三月份未動云、</p>
<h3>麥市微見軟弱</h3>
<p>昨期麥各月份微見軟弱、因洋麥報價微小、本月份之多頭、雖前收貨之意思但内幕中、或者均係廠家一進一出仍覺不能過分抬高、因此多方銷出、空頭亦情願　補、市遂轉平、遠期各月份因賣氣略盛、亦微軟弱、結果本月份較前日小三分、十一月份小二分、十二月份至三月份小一分、現麥市面、高貨仍緊、中次帶平統市共開平湖·海州·瑤灣·明麥一二千餘包由阜豐信大辦去云、</p>
<h3>南北貨大粒泉泡圓地價難鬆</h3>
<p>下檔紅黑棗價升</p>
<p>泉州泡圓近因申市走銷轉呆、各行大都遷就求售價無形中己降兩許、查昨日華興輪由泉入口、又到三千餘件、據各客函訉、上檔辦價依然挺硬便以申市觀之、其勢非跌不行、故此批兌價當有鬆望、</p>
<p>府紅棗　昨廣帮景昌隆號開出一批、計二百五十九件、身乾色紅而個子亦大、價升至六兩三錢、且地價亦漲至七元上下、</p>
<p>統手黑棗近因申銷活潑、地價升至十元零半、靑島客號開出一百數十包價升至八兩八錢、趨勢穏俏</p>
<h3>絲茶雙宫繭開價仍堅</h3>
<p>本埠雙宫絲廠因雙宫絲銷路暢還、大半照常開工、雙宫繭廠進未懈、繭價仍堅、昨由新綸等廠進無錫雙宫繭二百五十六擔、七百八十斤繅折、售價四十兩、絲本净扯三百兩左右、外加繅工按照現市、廠方殊難獲利云、</p>
<h3>貢熙綠茶俄銷續暢</h3>
<p>昨日路莊土莊兩路之珍眉針眉等綠茶、英法仍無大宗進胃、暇目珠茶、杜德洋行、雖有少數電轉交易、但供遇於求、市盤仍低、惟貢熙一項俄莊協助會、進意續趨濃厚、交易頗旺、祁門　茶、該莊亦有零星銷胃、如市面疲滯己久、茶價跌至極點、茶商所虧折、每担不下三四十兩云、</p>
<h3>疋頭市價一致堅挺</h3>
<p>本廠棉市昨日細布復小二分半至五分、</p>
<p>十六磅貨昨成交二三百件致各上漲、十三磅雙馬馬狗九江大通安慶等帮進胃亦殷、故現貨頗少、細料廣帮搜羅未己昨運去飛熊　城等牌有二百多件陽鶴藍雙魚温台寗波陸續仍有採辦、所以依然堅定、較之細布價俱須高起五六錢實爲近年來所罕見、粗斜亦頗活動現貨漸告缺乏矣、</p>
<p>東西疋頭市均堅挺、東貨之嗶嘰各類大有殆盡之狀、上春所難於出售者、現亦異常俏利馬眼嗶嘰售至二錢六分、；羅紋嗶嘰二錢七分、大廻紋二錢六分、小廻紋完全修　細嗶嘰愈趨愈高、下身貨己三錢出關、楊貴妃蕉葉題書均三錢零五厘、湖心亭三錢一分半、三友圖馬戲晋文公秃元嗶嘰均己三錢一分、古城會又漲五匯、昨開三錢四分寳球什色四君子秃元俱無現貨、客銷靑島長沙四川等帮均頗活動、西貨昨放　直貢呢又漲、開二錢六分二厘半、川帮成交五十件云、</p>
<h3>呢絨售盤明暗俱緊</h3>
<p>昨毛貨呢　非常俏俐、大路售船均堅、莊　末爾登及黄灰華特呢、趨勢格外緊張、買方火　候用、雖出足價格、亦難獲得、其漲風之盛、實屬僅見、其他厚薄呢絨毛貨、市銷亦暢、售盤明暗俱緊云、</p>
<h3>五金英馬口鐵静極思動</h3>
<p>英馬口鐵新近交易、因出口帮漸採辦、市象頗有静極思動之勢、昨日天津靑島牛莊各帮辦去之貨、共達七八百箱、其價九十磅、每箱十三兩七錢半、一百磅十四兩七錢半、調查市上現貨極覺有限、而出口帮復爭先收買、因此人心甚好、行情頻挺、據一般熟悉此中情形者去、敬漢口號生意一動、市象前途定有進步也、</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Unemployment Problems in the United States, Britain, and Japan</h3>
<p>The unemployment problem has become a widespread issue in various countries around the world today. Authorities in each country are deeply concerned and anxious, seeking a solution but unable to find one. Even in the United States, known for its thriving industries, incidents have arisen due to unemployed workers demanding relief. The authorities acknowledge that there are a total of 3.5 million unemployed workers in the United States. According to political estimates, approximately 5 million people are lacking employment. The number of foreigners willing to be sent abroad with official funding is quite large. Due to a lack of funds, the Immigration Bureau is currently only selecting the most disadvantaged foreigners to be repatriated, which shows the severity of the situation. According to the British Unemployment Weekly, the number of unemployed people in Britain is also increasing. There are 15,000 newly unemployed, bringing the total to 2,188,000. This indicates that although the Labor Party government has exerted all its efforts, its effectiveness in alleviating unemployment has yet to be seen. According to observers in Japan, unemployment panic is visible everywhere. The government's relief methods are limited to lending capital to enable people to make a living or distributing relief goods to prevent freezing and starvation. However, the effectiveness is minimal. It is also said that unemployed people often erect a wooden frame, write their resumes on it, and place it on the main road, standing behind it to await employment, which is a very difficult situation.</p>
<p>Overall, there are currently no effective methods to alleviate the unemployment problems in the United States, Britain, and Japan, and the situation is deteriorating daily. The reason why things are still peaceful is mostly due to the power of coercion, which cannot last long. If this is the case for the United States, Britain, and Japan, what about other countries? The unemployment problem is indeed the most important issue facing the world today.</p>

<h3>Negotiations Regarding Hankou's Sino-British Wharf</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The negotiations between the Hankou Municipal Government and Taikoo Dockyard regarding the construction of a riverside road in Hankou have been delayed for a long time. Recently, the Hankou Municipal Government and the company have agreed on terms, which have been submitted to the Central Government for review by the Ministries of Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Finance. It is reported that the outcome shows agreement with Taikoo's request to continue to enjoy the right to use the riverbank and mooring rights. Regarding the wharf tax, it is naturally not an issue as it is not currently implemented. However, when it is implemented in the future, Taikoo should also comply with paying it.

<h3>Bandits in Ji'an Kidnap a Large Number of Missionaries</h3>
<p>(Beiping) It is heard that the number of foreigners kidnapped by the bandits and communists in Ji'an is the largest since the Lincheng train robbery case in 1923. Bishop Mignani and a certain pastor were released by the bandits in order to negotiate ransom payments. They traveled to Jiujiang via Changsha. The bandits are now demanding a ransom of 10 million yuan. It is heard that Father Jacques and two Chinese priests have been killed. The kidnapped are Father Zeffre (French), Babadu, Gabozi, Bellino (all Italians), and six nuns, including four French, one Italian, and one Filipino. However, the bandits only reported five foreign nuns, perhaps mistaking one for a Chinese. The US Consul in Hankou is now negotiating with the authorities, demanding the rescue of the kidnapped Filipino nun. After Bishop Mi and a certain pastor arrived in Jiujiang, it was reported that Ji'an was heavily looted on October 14, but not much property was destroyed. The three communist leaders Peng Dehuai, Zhu De, and Mao Zedong are all stationed in Ji'an. After Bishop Mi and his companion left Ji'an, they were arrested several times by the communists.

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Nagai Makes Outrageous Remarks</h3>
<p>Wantonly Disparaging China's International Status</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Believes It Was an Intentional Insult</p>
<p>Seiyukai Criticizes Kijūrō Shidehara's China Diplomacy</p>
<p>A telegram from Tokyo on the 22nd via Electric News stated that when Vice Foreign Minister Nagai met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing, Nagai made remarks about treating China as a first-class country, which Chiang considered an insult to China, hurting his feelings. Regarding this issue, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Electric News reporter that Mr. Nagai was on an inspection and sightseeing trip in a completely personal capacity and had no diplomatic mission whatsoever. However, some newspapers still claimed that Mr. Nagai had mentioned the issue of Minister Obata's exequatur. In fact, it had been decided before Mr. Nagai's departure for China that Mr. Obata would be appointed as ambassador to another country. Mr. Nagai was certainly aware of this matter, so he would not have requested recognition of the issue of Obata's exequatur again when meeting with Chiang and other key figures in Nanjing. This is clearly a misunderstanding. As for the mention of "first-class country," this is merely a diplomatic expression and is not intended as an insult. There is absolutely no problem. (See Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's recent report at the National Government Memorial Week).</p>
<p>A telegram from Tokyo on the 22nd via Electric News stated that the Seiyukai held a meeting of its executive committee yesterday afternoon to discuss countermeasures for the current situation. At the meeting, Council Chairman Okada proposed that the issue of Minister Obata's exequatur, Zhang Xueliang's rejection of President Senkoku's meeting, the Haeju sea salt issue, etc., are all products of Shidehara's weak diplomacy, which is truly a national humiliation. He requested an investigation of the truth, which was approved by the entire meeting and entrusted to the Foreign Affairs Department of the Political Affairs Research Committee.</p>
<h3>Italy and Russia Sign New Economic Agreement</h3>
<p>Italy Guarantees Russian Credit Purchases</p>
<p>Result of Tense US-Russia Economic Relations</p>
<p>Moscow News: Recently, the Soviet Union and Italy signed an economic agreement stipulating that Russia will order various goods from Italy on credit, and the Italian government will guarantee 75% of the supply. The Russian government is very satisfied with this new agreement. At the same time, Italy also benefits greatly, as Russia's purchases in Italy can be doubled compared to the current fiscal year (1929-1930). The obvious purpose of signing this new agreement is to boycott American goods. European countries are very dissatisfied with the United States since the implementation of the new tariff rates, and Russia, originally a major customer of American goods, is very reluctant due to various difficulties imposed by the United States. Therefore, it has turned to Italy. The economic cooperation between the two major new forces in European politics, the Communist Party and the Fascist Party, has thus taken shape. (World)</p>

<h3>Nearly Three Hundred Dead in German Coal Mine Explosion</h3>
<p>One Hundred and Forty Corpses Recovered</p>
<p>Rescue Teams Continue Excavation Efforts</p>
<p>National News Agency, Anzhen, 22nd – Today, one hundred and forty corpses were unearthed from the Ersdorf mine shaft. The bodies were largely unrecognizable. Thirty more died above ground due to collapsing structures. General estimates suggest the death toll may reach three hundred, as over a hundred workers remain trapped within the mine shafts. Though rescue teams are exerting every effort to open passages for rescue, the mine is filled with noxious gases, threatening the miners' survival. The rescue teams have temporarily installed powerful searchlights near the buried mine shafts, their beams piercing the darkness. Rescue workers tirelessly dig, and some survivors have been pulled from the earth, but many have suffered severe gas poisoning, offering little hope of recovery. The cause of the accident remains unknown. Although rumors circulated regarding an explosion in the storage depot, this has been definitively ruled out. The authorities have appointed a committee to conduct a thorough investigation. With over half of the mine's administrative staff deceased, operations are unlikely to resume soon. Meanwhile, condolences have been pouring in from various quarters. The French Foreign Minister, as well as the French and Italian governments, have sent messages of condolence.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 21st – Following the explosion at the William Coal Mine in Ersdorf, Germany, forty miner corpses have been recovered by this afternoon. The exact number of deaths remains uncertain. The explosion occurred during shift change, and the destruction of office records has made it impossible to determine the exact number of those trapped. The explosion could be heard for miles. The blast was followed by flames and thick smoke rising into the sky. The mine entrance, tunnels, offices, and a 150-foot tower were all destroyed. Many miners, killed or injured, were buried beneath the debris. Residents in nearby areas who rushed to the scene after hearing the explosion were injured by flying debris like metal and glass fragments hundreds of yards away. Several miners trapped in the mine have been safely rescued, suggesting the ventilation system in the lower levels may have remained intact, offering hope for the safety of many miners. Another report indicates that the death toll is now at ninety-five, with seventy-six injured. All the injured have been hospitalized. There were 667 miners in the tunnels at the time of the explosion, with over four hundred now rescued. It is believed that the explosion was caused by overheating of two thousand pounds of explosives stored one thousand feet underground.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Bombay, 21st – The Indian National Congress, defying the authorities' ban, organized a demonstration today, leading to a violent clash with the police. Demonstrators threw stones, and the police opened fire, causing many injuries. The chairman of the Struggle Committee and four other committee members were arrested. Furthermore, on the Bombay, Jhelum Railway mainline, some individuals removed sections of the track in an attempt to derail a fast train. Fortunately, the sabotage was discovered in advance, averting a disaster. The perpetrators have not yet been identified.

<h3>Brazilian Revolutionary Forces Approach Capital</h3>

General Vargas has been appointed Supreme Commander of the revolutionary forces. According to a government gazette, government forces have achieved a victory on the Minas Gerais front.

<p>Pacific News, Buenos Aires, 22nd – Reports from the revolutionary forces and the Brazilian capital are highly contradictory. The revolutionary forces claim to have occupied several cities in the Rio Grande do Sul province and have advanced to locations not far from the capital. The government is increasingly unpopular. Of the 80,000 reserves called up, it is reported that only 40,000 responded to the mobilization order.

<h3>Former German Bank President Visits Hoover</h3>
<p>U.S. Authorities Deny Connection to War Debts</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 21st – The arrival of Dr. Schacht, former president of the Reichsbank, has drawn considerable attention from financial and diplomatic circles. Dr. Schacht has met with President Hoover, the Secretary of State, the Treasury Secretary, and others. Rumors are circulating that the discussions concern the possibility of Germany announcing a suspension of reparations payments. However, this claim has been firmly denied by both the State Department and the White House. The Treasury Department has also denied that the government is currently considering whether to allow the Allied nations to suspend war debt payments for five years. Dr. Schacht stated in a speech at the Foreign Policy Association today that Hitlerism in Germany is an entirely constitutional movement. The Nazi Party's recent election victory reflects the reaction of many Germans against the treatment imposed by the former enemy countries after the war.</p>

<p>Speech by the Presidium: Presidium Chairman Dai Chuanxian delivered a welcome address, stating: "Commander-in-Chief Chiang and victorious generals, today, all the people of the capital, with the utmost sincerity and enthusiasm, welcome Commander-in-Chief Chiang and the generals from the front. We welcome the triumphant return with a clear and unified understanding, that the Republic of China was created by the Three Principles of the People and the immeasurable spirit and sacrifices of the Premier and countless patriots. However, China has accumulated thousands of years of old habits, the people's intellect has not fully awakened, and with the oppression of warlords and bureaucrats, the Xinhai Revolution, while overthrowing the Manchu dynasty, did not eliminate the existing warlords and bureaucrats. The Premier felt that eliminating the warlord forces required a genuine revolution. Since the Xinhai Revolution, there was no genuine revolutionary army until the Premier established the Whampoa Military Academy in 1924 to cultivate genuine revolutionary soldiers. The Party Song we sang today is the training lyrics personally written by the Premier when the Whampoa Military Academy opened. This training lyrics embodies the spirit of the Chinese nation for thousands of years, to teach our comrades and the entire nation. Therefore, the Premier said that the Three Principles of the People is what our party follows. Building the Republic of China is not the end, but also to advance to the Great Harmony. 'You, men of purpose,' means each comrade, being the vanguard for the people, is to lead the people to do all the work. 'Be diligent and courageous, to the end,' is to lead the people to complete the construction of the Republic of China. The Premier had such great training for revolutionary soldiers, the training lyrics for educating soldiers are also training lyrics for all comrades and the entire nation. Our Commander-in-Chief was then the President of the Whampoa Military Academy, inheriting the Premier's training lyrics, training revolutionary soldiers, advancing step by step, and today, most of the army has received this spiritual education and inspiration, creating today's great revolutionary army. However, the revolutionary process sacrificed hundreds of thousands of loyal and brave soldiers, countless comrades, and countless patriotic citizens to achieve today's victory. The warlords from the Qing Dynasty to today have been completely overthrown. From now on, the whole country must be of one mind and work together for the construction of China. The government is doing its work in accordance with the Premier's last will. The people of the whole country should also, in accordance with the Premier's last will, do what each person should do and persevere to success, in order to maintain this military victory. This military victory is actually a victory of ideology. Our Commander-in-Chief, the Chairman of the National Government, has not only led us to eliminate the warlords but also should be our political leader. Now that we have achieved military victory, we also hope that Chairman Chiang will lead us to truly build politics. Today, we sincerely welcome the triumphant return. Firstly, we recognize that the people's military force has defeated the warlords' military force, and in the future, for the benefit of the people and the country, we can achieve real benefits based on ideology. Secondly, we console our Commander-in-Chief and the triumphant generals. Thirdly, we hope that Chairman Chiang will lead us to earnestly carry out political construction. I believe Commander-in-Chief Chiang will definitely accommodate the sincerity and meaning of the capital's people in welcoming him today." Dai concluded by leading everyone in chanting "Long live!" After Dai's speech, the flag presentation ceremony was held. Dai Chuanxian presented the flag, and Commander-in-Chief Chiang and others received the flag, which was inscribed with the words "Pillars of the Party and Nation."</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief's Speech: Next, Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech, stating: "Chairman of the rally, comrades, fellow countrymen, generals at the front, today, we are in the capital and receive the welcome from the capital's welcoming rally. It is indeed very gratifying for our generals at the front to see our comrades and fellow countrymen in the capital in this warm welcome. However, thinking of the more than one hundred thousand soldiers who died in battle at the front, and the countless people who died to suppress the rebellion, the thought of the front not only cannot bring happiness but is also very painful. Furthermore, at this time, our country has still not achieved equality and freedom as an independent nation. The generals at the front and the people of the whole country have this feeling, especially the generals at the front who feel it even more deeply. The revolution has been going on for nineteen years, and we still cannot achieve a position of freedom and equality in the international community. Fellow countrymen, today, all of you have come to welcome the triumphant generals. The triumphant generals have a word that I, Chiang Kai-shek, represent to report to all comrades and fellow countrymen, that this time, in the campaign to suppress Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang, we won a victory. The generals at the front believe that the victory was not won by the soldiers, but by the Premier's ideology. Moreover, it was won by the comrades and fellow countrymen who supported us spiritually and psychologically in the rear. This mentality, I believe, is the same mentality of the people of the whole country. I hope that in the future, the people of the whole country should permanently maintain this acquired mentality, that is, I hope that in the future, the people of the whole country should build a country with ideology outside of military affairs. Today, I have a proposal to report to all fellow countrymen, that during the period of political tutelage in the Republic of China, there is a metaphor that the people of the whole country should work for ten hours. Foreign countries work for eight hours, and we should add two hours to catch up with them. Comrades, fellow countrymen, during this year of political tutelage, we must know the international difficulties and the suffering of sacrifice at the front. We must follow the Premier's last will, be diligent and courageous, maintain the current mentality, and I believe that working two more hours every day will surely build a country with ideology. Chiang Kai-shek also thanked the fellow countrymen in the rear for supporting the mentality of the front, and hoped that all sectors of agriculture, industry, commerce, and education would forever maintain this mentality. Long live the Republic of China!" Dai Chuanxian then submitted Chiang's proposal for a vote, and the entire venue raised their hands in agreement.</p>
<p>Summary of Speeches: After Chiang's speech, Hua Wenxuan, Deputy Commander of the 44th Division, delivered a speech, stating that when the campaign to suppress the rebellion began, general reactionary propaganda claimed that Feng and Yan's troops numbered over three or four hundred thousand, with powerful forces, and that the central army might not be able to defeat them. At that time, the central troops at the front all understood that this suppression of rebellion was a struggle for ideology, and that an army with ideology would surely defeat the rebellious rabble. Although Feng and Yan's armies were large, their defeat was predictable. Now, with the help of the people, the rebels have been wiped out, and the peaceful unification is near. In the future, the government will be responsible for the reorganization of the army. We soldiers only know that obedience to orders is our duty, and on the one hand, we will strive to eliminate the bandits and communists in various places, so that the people of the whole country can live and work in peace and engage in construction. Next, Wu Zhihui gave a speech, stating that today's welcoming significance is that the fellow countrymen of the whole country expressed that they have entrusted the right person. Now, Commander-in-Chief Chiang and the generals at the front have completely eliminated the evil forces and can be said to have fulfilled the responsibility entrusted to them. But what we have been entrusted with, how will we fulfill this responsibility? I gave a speech in Hangzhou on National Day this year, believing that China is the earliest civilized nation on earth, and its thoughts and knowledge are superior to those of all countries. Unfortunately, in recent years, the people of the country only know how to worship foreigners and belittle themselves. As a result, Marx and Lenin took the opportunity to enter. However, they do not know that the ideology of these people is not worth a penny, and the Three Principles of the People created by our Premier are actually tens of millions of times stronger than Marxism. Moreover, the Premier's knowledge is profound and his personality is great, and there are few people in the world who can match him. If we can strive to follow the Three Principles of the People advocated by our Premier, the success will be great in the future. I hope that all the people will take on this responsibility and live up to the heavy responsibility entrusted by the Premier. Finally, Zhang Xueliang represented Wang Jiazhen and Tao Xuan, and they shouted slogans and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Hubei Province's Bandit Suppression Funds Confirmed</h3>
<p>Issuing a Three Million Yuan Public Bond</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Regarding the matter of bandit suppression in Hubei Province, preparations for implementation began after He Chengjun returned to Hubei. All the troops responsible for bandit suppression have also arrived in Hubei successively, stationed in different areas. The bandit suppression plan has also been submitted to Commander-in-Chief Chiang by Civil Affairs Director Wu Xingya in Nanjing. Recently, a telegram was received from Wu stating that it had been approved by Commander-in-Chief Chiang. In the future, when all the troops have fully arrived, it will be implemented according to the plan. The bandit suppression funds are expected to be approximately one million yuan per month. It was previously agreed upon by Director He and the Special Tax Office that 50,000 yuan would be allocated monthly, which is still far short. In addition, the counties have suffered from banditry for a long time, and nine out of ten houses are empty. It will take at least three years to restore the situation. It is difficult to bear this huge amount of money. It is reported that Director He has decided to set the bandit suppression period to be within three months, with an estimated cost of three million yuan. It has been submitted to Chairman Chiang for approval to issue a three million yuan bandit suppression public bond with the Hubei Elephant Nose Mountain Mineral Sands as collateral. However, the issuance of public bonds will take time, and it will be difficult to use in any case. It is planned that within a</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>day, the Financial Director Zhang Guanshi will go to Nanjing together to borrow three million yuan in short-term tariff treasury bills from the central government for use in Hubei. First, borrow cash from the Hankou banking group as collateral, and then draw it on schedule after the bandit suppression public bond is issued. (October 21)</p>
<h3>Lu Diping Arrives in Hankou from Nanjing to Meet with He</h3>
<p>Seeking Advice on Bandit Suppression Strategies</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Lu Diping, the ninth Route Army Commander and Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, went to Nanjing from Nanchang this time to pay respects to the late President Tan and report the bandit suppression situation in Jiangxi Province to Commander-in-Chief Chiang. He has now completed his official duties. On the 21st, accompanied by Hankou Mayor Liu Wendao and Section Chief Zhou Shenru of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, he arrived in Hankou by postal airline at 3 p.m. He immediately went to the headquarters to meet with Acting Chairman He Chengjun to seek advice on the joint bandit suppression plan of the three provinces and discuss matters in secret for about an hour. That evening, He Chengjun hosted a banquet at the headquarters to welcome Lu and Liu. I sent my card to visit Lu and Liu upon their arrival. Mr. Lu's remarks were as follows: (This time, the bandits and communists, including Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Dong, have colluded and disturbed Jiangxi from Hunan, and their momentum is quite strong. After my Ninth Route Army calmly confronted them, they were severely wounded many times. Recently, my 18th Division Zhang Huizhan's troops, together with the New Fifth Division Gong Bingfan's troops, the New Thirteenth Division Deng Ying's troops, and the 50th Division Tan Daoyuan's troops, as well as the central air force, carried out a fierce suppression, and successively recovered Xingan, Qingjiang, Ji'an, and other places. The number of bandits killed and wounded was extremely high. In addition, with the successive return of the victorious troops from the front to Hubei and Jiangxi, it will not be difficult to eliminate the remaining bandits completely in the shortest period of time. My visit to Hankou this time is to meet Acting Chairman He to seek advice and connect everything. Because the political and military affairs of Jiangxi Province need to be dealt with urgently, I cannot stay in Hankou for a long time. I have decided to return to Jiangxi by plane on the 22nd.)

<h3>Protecting Traffic on the Hunan-Hubei Railway</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: In the recent two months, train traffic from Changsha to Wuchang has been intermittent. The railway stations, sleepers, and roadbed bridges of the Luojiang, Taolin, Huangshajie, Matang, Yingjiawan, Guiyi, and Yunxi stations between Yuezhou and Xiangyin have been burned and destroyed by bandits. Wherever the bandits went, they ordered the residents along the road to send a hoe from each family (men must hold iron hoes to register with the bandits, and women must also send one person if there are no men) and take on the task of destroying the railway, or the whole family would be burned and killed. Therefore, the losses and material consumption of the Hunan-Hubei Road this time have been unprecedented in previous military operations. Moreover, the repair and damage have been carried out in a rotational manner for nearly two months. The military and road workers are exhausted, and the impact on military affairs and commerce is significant. Initially, Qian Dajun's Teaching Division was responsible for the suppression, and then a part of Wang Dongyuan's 15th Division was added to assist. Recently, the entire 31st Division of Tao Guang was added, suppressing from different routes. The bandits, including Kong Helong, Li Hangshi, Hu Yun (female bandit), and Hou Qi, were driven east of the railway line and fled towards Pingjiang. Now, the headquarters of the Fourth Route Army, in addition to ordering Tao Guang's entire division and Hou Pengfei's brigade of Wang Dongyuan's division, as well as Zhu Xingshu's bandit suppression detachment, to form a large encirclement to suppress Pingjiang, is still worried that there are still remaining bandits lurking, disturbing the rear, and destroying the railway tracks again. Therefore, the Second Brigade of Tong Kun's troops of the Xiangxi Bandit Suppression Command and the two regiments of the headquarters' Independent Regiment Ye Wenke's troops, as well as Guo Bugao's Second Bandit Suppression Detachment, have been dispatched to various stations in the Chang-Yue section to be responsible for maintaining railway and telegraph line traffic and suppressing nearby scattered bandits, in order to ensure thoroughness. The order of the headquarters of the Fourth Route Army is recorded as follows: (It is found that the Wu-Chang Railway is related to the traffic between Hunan and Hubei, and troops should be stationed at key points to maintain the road administration. It is ordered that the troops of Brigade Commander Tong Kun of the Second Brigade of the Xiangxi Bandit Suppression Command be stationed in the Luojiang Xinshi Guiyi area, and also take into account the defense of Baishui Taolin. The troops of Regiment Commander Ye Wenke of the Independent Regiment shall take a train from Changsha to Huangshajie immediately, taking into account Yingjiawan, and closely liaising with Tong's troops in Taolin Temple. The troops of the Second Bandit Suppression Detachment Commander Guo Bugao shall take a train from Changsha to Yunxi immediately, taking into account the defense of Lukou Chenglingji, and closely liaising with Tao's (Guang) troops in Yuezhou. Each of these troops shall be fully responsible for the designated stationed and taken-care sections, and completely eliminate the nearby scattered bandits. If there is any negligence, severe punishment will be given.) (October 20)</p>
<h3>Fighting Near Nanning</h3>
<p>Fierce Battle Lasted a Day and Night, Guangxi Army Retreats</p>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: Fighting recently broke out near Nanning, Guangxi, and is currently still ongoing. The Guangxi army within the city of Nanning has long been surrounded by the Yunnan army. Therefore, Bai Chongxi's army from Liuzhou urgently wants to lift the siege of Yongguan, so that the troops of Huang Xuchu and Wei Yunsong in the city can escape danger. Bai has recently incorporated the old troops of Li Mingrui in the Longzhou area, to contain the rear of the 10th Route Yunnan Army led by Lu Han. Bai Chongxi then led his newly formed troops out of Longshan and Wuming, to contain the 8th Route Army led by Yu Hanmou stationed in Binyang. On the 11th of this month, they suddenly launched attacks on the defense areas of the 8th and 10th Routes in three directions, with about 3,000 to 4,000 troops. Bai Chongxi's troops advanced from Wuming, Zhen Hedong's troops came out of Shanglin Silong, and Li Mingrui's troops attacked the rear of the Yunnan army at Fufeng from Chongshan. At the same time, the Guangxi army under Huang Xuchu and Wei Yunsong in Yongcheng also broke out of the siege, launching counterattacks against the 8th and 10th Route Armies in different directions. The Guangxi army from Silong advanced to the Goulou Pass, confronting the brigade of Li Zhenqiu of Yu Fu's division of the 8th Route Army. From the morning of the 12th to 4 p.m., the Guangxi army led by He was unsuccessful and began to retreat towards Longshan. According to the aircraft report on the 14th, our army (8th Route) Yu's Division, Li Zhenqiu's brigade, fought fiercely with the enemy near Goulou Pass in Silong at noon on the 12th. By Shenshi (3-5 p.m.), He Zhendong's enemy was defeated. In this battle, more than 500 enemies were killed, more than four water-cooled machine guns, three mortars, and more than 300 rifles were seized, and more than 400 prisoners were captured. Our army suffered 30 to 40 casualties, and is currently still in pursuit. Our aircraft are conducting reconnaissance and bombing every day, killing many enemies. [Signed] Zhang Zixuan. The 8th Route Commander-in-Chief Chen Jitang arrived in Wuzhou at 4 p.m. on the 15th, and will inspect the Wuzhou troops before departing for Dahe, Pingnan, and other places to inspect defense. As for Shanglin (90 li from Binyang) in the front, it is located at the border of Binyang and Wuming. Li's Brigade of Yu Hanmou's Division has already advanced to Shanglin to concentrate. The two departments of the teaching brigade, Zeng Youren and Zhang Zhiying, were sent to Binyang to take over the defense, and Fan Dexing and Chen Hanguang's two regiments were stationed to guard Qianjiang and Litang. It is heard that the enemy has also been increasing troops to Wuming, Qianjiang, and Shanglin for days. There will probably still be a major battle near Binyang. To the southwest of Nanning, on the 12th, battles also broke out simultaneously with Silong and Shanglin. On that day, a part of the Guangxi army came out of Wuming and fought fiercely for several hours with the 98th Division Sun Du brigade of the 10th Route Yunnan Army and the 99th Division Zhu Xu's Zeng Shuhuai brigade stationed on Gaofeng Ridge in northern Yong. According to Lu Han's report on the 12th, the enemy launched an attack on the 10th regiment stationed at Gaofeng, and we responded, breaking through the enemy's formation, capturing two water-cooled machine guns, hundreds of rifles, and banners, symbols, rosters, and other items. Many others were captured and killed. Troops are still being sent to pursue. [Signed] Lu Han. It was found that on the 12th, the Yunnan army responded in two directions. The two troops of Wei Yunsong and Lei of the Guangxi army rushing out of Yongcheng were repulsed by the two divisions of the Yunnan army Zhu Xu and Zhang Chong in the Shaping Wushui River area in southern Yong. The Guangxi army Li Mingrui's troops that attacked from Taiping Prefecture were resisted by Lu Han who personally led his troops. The two sides fought fiercely for a day and night, and the Wei and Li enemy troops were defeated. Now the two troops of Wei and Lei have retreated back to Yongcheng, while Li Mingrui's troops have retreated back to Longzhou. (October 17)</p>
<h3>Partial Opening of Traffic Between Tianjin and Jinan</h3>
<p>Jinan dispatch: Recently, the No. 90-2 freight and passenger mixed train between Tianjin and Jinan originally took Dezhou as the boundary. Only the locomotives were exchanged in Dezhou, and other freight and passenger mixed trains did not need to be changed. The passenger and freight tickets were also through tickets from Tianjin to Jinan. However, the revenue north of Dezhou belonged to the Tianjin Bureau, and the revenue south of Dezhou belonged to the Pukou Bureau. However, starting today, there has been another change. Jinan Station received an order from the Pukou Bureau that from the 20th, the No. 10 train departing from Jinan North will stop at Dezhou and will no longer go north. In Dezhou, it will be changed to No. 9 train and return. At night, it will be changed to No. 12 to Dezhou, and in Dezhou it will be changed to No. 11 train to return. Jinan Station sells tickets to Dezhou. Passengers and goods going north from Dezhou must buy separate tickets. Free tickets south of Dezhou are not valid. Tianjin Station sells tickets to Dezhou. Passengers and goods going south from Dezhou must also buy separate tickets. Free tickets are also not valid south of Dezhou. Both passenger and freight transport feel inconvenienced by this. However, the reason for this is that both railway bureaus are cautious about the vehicles, and there are no other problems. The arrival times of each train between Jinan and Dezhou are recorded as follows: Train No. 10 from Jinan to Dezhou departs at 11 a.m. and arrives in Dezhou at 2:54 p.m. At 5 p.m., it is changed to No. 9 and departs from Dezhou, arriving in Jinan at 9:06 p.m. At 12 a.m., it is changed back to Train No. 12 and departs from Jinan to Dezhou, arriving in Dezhou at 3:54 a.m. the next morning. At 6 a.m., it is changed to No. 11 and departs from Dezhou, arriving in Jinan at 10:06 a.m. At 11 a.m., it is changed back to No. 10 and returns. In short, it is just this one train that travels back and forth between Dezhou and Jinan. (October 20)</p>
<h3>Post-War Inspection Notes on the Longhai Railway</h3>
<p>Recent Situation in Zhengzhou</p>
<p>Zhengzhou dispatch: A reporter group from Xuzhou inspected Zhengzhou, and the following is a record of what they saw and heard.</p>
<p>Recent Situation in Zhengbu: The reporter group left Bianxi at 7 p.m. on the 15th and passed through Hanzhuang, Zhongmu, Baisha, Gucheng, etc. along the way. No war trenches were found. However, there was a lot of white sand, and the sand on both sides of the railway was half a foot thick, which was very desolate. At 11 p.m., they arrived at Zhengzhou Railway Station. At that time, the rear troops of the Central Army were waiting to be demobilized and boarded the train from Zhengzhou. All the inns were full and there was no room to stand. The reporter group temporarily rested at the Zhengzhou Office of the Longhai Transportation Command. According to Deputy Director You Fei, traffic between Zhengzhou and Luoyang was restored on the 12th, and through tickets were available from the 14th, with one train running every day. The westbound train can now reach Shaanxi. The Yellow River Bridge on the Pinghan Railway was damaged when Feng's army retreated, but it has now been repaired. The northbound train can reach the southern end of the Yellow River Bridge. The next morning, they inspected the commercial port and found cellars everywhere. The four cellars under the platform were very large, dozens of steps in size, covered with earth and zhangs (unit of measurement, roughly 3 meters). It was said that they were inhabited by senior generals of Feng's army. Feng stayed in Zhengzhou more often during the war. At first, he lived in Fushou Street in the commercial port, but due to the fierce attacks by the Central Air Force, he moved to the Chenghuang Temple in the city. The National Hotel, Fuchang Hotel, and Wuzhou Hotel in the commercial port where his senior generals lived were all bombed by planes. At 10 p.m. on the 6th, Feng's army went west. Hao Mengling's 54th Division of the Central Army was the first to enter the city port. Hao was appointed Zhengzhou Garrison Commander. Since a large number of troops are gathered at the moment, they are waiting to be demobilized, and post-war matters are still being handled. At noon, they went to Zhengxian County to inspect the city, which is located two li northeast of the station. The bricks and stones have been removed, leaving only the earth foundation. The earth foundations around the city are all dug with cellars, arranged like honeycombs. The houses in the city also have cellars. County Magistrate Xie Zechao has only been in office for three days. The county government only has 60 guard guns. When Feng's army was in the countryside, they established a military service committee to supply everything. The committee is still continuing to operate. Various losses are still under investigation. The city is extremely desolate, fully displaying the post-war scene.</p>
<p>Military Interview: On the 16th, the command was visited. The command is located behind the ticket office of the station. Director He arrived in Zhengzhou from Wuhan on the 12th, and the command has just been established. Since He was busy with official duties, he was received by Chief of Staff Zhou Weigang. According to reports, the current military situation is that Feng's army retreated to Hebei. The troops of Sun Liangcheng, Sun Lianzhong, Sun Dianying, Liu Ruming, and Pang Bingxun have mostly contacted the central government to express their sincerity. The central government has always been generous and has not yet crossed the river to pursue them. Those who retreated to the west were the troops of Song Zheyuan and Ge Yunlong, etc., who have now retreated to the pass. The central government's pursuit team has already passed Shaanxi. As for the troops of Ji Hongchang, who have surrendered, they will be transferred to Xiangcheng for reorganization. Liang Guanying's troops will also be transferred from Ronggong back to Dezhou for reorganization. The military post-war matters in Henan Province are nothing more than relieving suffering and recuperating. They are currently reporting to the central government for handling. In the afternoon, Garrison Commander Hao Mengling was visited again. The garrison headquarters is located in Hefeng Inn in the commercial port. It is understood that Hao's 54th Division and Shangguan Yunxiang's 47th Division were organized into the Third Column when they attacked from the Pinghan Railway. They advanced on the west side of the route and attacked Zhengzhou between Xuchang and Yuzhou. The 47th Division moved into the Xushui Town south of the Longhai Railway, cutting off the Longhai Railway. Hao's Division directly took Zhengzhou, fighting fiercely with Feng's army in the Huanggang Temple and Shili Pu area southwest of Zhengzhou. Feng's army dug gathering point trenches around Zhengzhou, which were dug in the recent month. After breaking through the battlements, they entered Zhengzhou on the evening of the 6th. At that time, Xinzheng and Changge had not yet fallen. The Feng's army combat troops along the way were a small part of the Jin army in Yingqiao west of Xu, Ruan Xuanwu's troops in Yuzhou, and Feng's army purely in the suburbs of Zhengzhou. There were fierce battles in Meizishan, Wangkou, and other places, and about a dozen large cannons were captured. Hao was commissioned on the 8th and his troops were responsible for the defense of Zhengzhou. The 47th Division was also stationed in Zhengzhou for temporary rest.</p>
<p>Disaster Statistics: Zhengzhou was the rear base of Feng's army's Longping routes during the war. It was the most requisitioned and suffered the most. Since Feng's army came east, Zhengxian County was ordered to establish a military service committee, with the seven district chiefs of the county responsible. The commercial port was the responsibility of the Chamber of Commerce. According to the statistics of the military service committee, the committee handled about 1,000 large carts, with an average of three animals and two laborers per cart, and more than 1,000 stretcher bearers. 4,000 soldiers were conscripted. Almost all men between the ages of 15 and 60 were enlisted. The trenches around the city were all dug by civilians, with two meals a day. The length of the trenches was about 30 li from east to west and about 20 li from north to south, surrounding the east, south, west, and one corner of the northwest. Most of the villages were used as trenches for concealment. There were communication trenches between the villages to connect them. The excavation took</p>

<h3>Domestic News Roundup</h3>
<p>more than two weeks. The closest was five li from the city, and the farthest was about 20 li, occupying more than 20 villages. The trenches stretched for more than 100 li. A total of 1.1 million jin of wheat, more than 800,000 jin of millet, more than 2 million jin of bran, 9 million jin of firewood, and 7 million jin of horse grass were requisitioned. The Northwest Bank's non-redeemable "added-character tickets" were used to exchange for cash, amounting to 40,000 yuan. The so-called "added-character tickets" were tickets originally printed by the Northwest Bank with added characters printed on the back. All these supplies were borne by the farmers, with each mu (unit of area) charged more than two yuan. However, the above statistics are only those handled by the committee. It is estimated that the free requisition in the countryside is more than ten or a hundred times that amount. The Finance Department of Feng's army requisitioned 7,000 yuan from the county every month. The expenses handled by the military service committee were more than one million yuan. According to the statistics of the Chamber of Commerce, Feng's army needed 30,000 jin of flour and 20,000 jin of millet every day when they were in Zhengzhou. Since entering Zhengzhou, they demanded this amount every day. At first, they used opium as payment. The military station distributed opium twice. The first time was 8,590 taels, and the second time was 28,200 taels, with an average price of two yuan per tael. Later, they used requisitioned wheat as exchange, which was handled by Tongyi Gong Flour Mill. When Weishou Commander Li Guanglong was in Zhengzhou, he demanded 2,000 yuan per month to cover expenses. When retreating, he demanded 30,000 sets of overcoats from Zhengbu. They did not have time to make them all, so they ordered 10,000 sets to be made in Zhengzhou and 10,000 sets in Xinxiang. Later, due to the hasty retreat, they changed it to 100,000 yuan, then to 60,000 yuan and 30,000 yuan, and finally took 20,000 yuan away. During the war, about 200 people were killed and about 500-600 people were injured in the entire port. The losses of houses and property are still under investigation. When Feng's army was in Zhengzhou last year, the discipline was very good. This time, the hungry army's discipline was disrupted, and it was even more chaotic during the retreat. Whenever they encountered someone with neat clothes and hats, they would borrow money from them to cover their travel expenses. According to Zhengzhou people, the market in the commercial port may be restored next year due to the convenience of transportation. The countryside was severely affected by the disaster, and nine out of ten houses were empty. Furthermore, due to the lack of livestock and vehicles, it is difficult to sow wheat, and there is no hope for the spring harvest. It is feared that it will not be restored for four or five years. This year's winter is cold, and next year's spring famine is even more worrying. Relief efforts cannot be delayed. (October 17)</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Bandits in Dingyuan, Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>A Large Group of Ferocious Bandits Broke in at Dawn</p>
<p>Entrenched for a Day, Retreated Only at Night</p>
<p>Bengbu dispatch: Dingyuan is a small town in northern Anhui, with a closed atmosphere and fierce customs. In recent years, due to the impact of war, bandits have appeared in the territory from time to time, but fortunately there are no large gangs of bandits, so the harm is not too severe. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 15th of this month, suddenly seven or eight hundred ferocious bandits sneaked to the outside of the county seat, hoping to rob the county seat. The next day (16th) at dawn, as soon as the city gate opened, the bandits suddenly broke in through the north gate, half with red spears and half with quick guns, very fierce. They seized the guns of the city gate guards, and divided into two groups to enter the city. One group rushed directly to the district security group, the finance bureau, and the prison, confiscating the firearms of the security group, then looting the finance bureau, driving away the staff of the prison, and releasing the prisoners. The other group besieged the county government and attacked to the outside of the signature room. County Magistrate Xu Yongxiu hurriedly led the county government soldiers to bravely attack. Gunfire in the office was boiling. County Magistrate Xu supervised the team and fought fiercely with the bandits for more than an hour, and then drove the bandits out of the county government gate, killing four bandits on the spot and capturing one alive. The bandits then increased their large team and surrounded the county government on three sides, launching fierce attacks. The police team in the county government also bravely resisted, so the bandits failed to attack. Soon the local militia outside the city heard the alarm and quickly joined hundreds of people to enter the city and attack from both sides. Most of the bandits were driven out of the city, but there were still more than 200 people who were entrenched in the security group, the finance bureau, and the prison, stubbornly resisting. County Magistrate Xu led the team to surround them on three sides, and fought fiercely for another five hours. Just as the temporarily organized 3rd Regiment of the 45th Division passed through the territory and attacked from inside and outside, the bandits could not support themselves and broke out from the south gate in the evening, fleeing. About a dozen bandits were killed, and the people also suffered slight casualties. Zhang Daocun, a staff member of the county government, was injured in the foot. The land tax collection office, tax deed office, dispatch office, and urban slaughter office were all looted. The number of shops and households that were robbed was also not small, and the local losses were quite large. (October 20)</p>
<h3>Tobacco Seedlings Widely Planted in Various Counties in Southern Fujian</h3>
<p>Provincial Government Strictly Orders Fang Shengtao and Zhang Zhen to Investigate and Prohibit</p>
<p>Fuzhou dispatch: Since the military uprising, the ban on tobacco in southern Fujian has gradually become lax again, and unscrupulous soldiers have even sheltered it. It is heard that Yang Shuzhuang has now immediately telegraphed military commissioners Fang Shengtao and Zhang Zhen, the commander of the Xin Yi Division, to be responsible for the investigation and prohibition, and ordered the armies under their command not to knowingly violate the prohibition. The reason is that in the Tongyanping Pacification Office, there are instances of condoning the private planting of tobacco seedlings by villagers, levying donations on cultivated land, and sheltering the planting of opium poppies on their behalf. The price has risen from more than 20 yuan to more than 100 yuan, so it is necessary to strictly prohibit it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the people of Quanzhou recently filed a complaint against Fang Shengtao for various inappropriate measures, requesting the abolition of the Military Commissioner's Office. They also said that the Military Commissioner's Office actually hinted to the stationed army to persuade the people to plant tobacco seedlings. Now Jinjiang, Nan'an, Hui'an, Tongan, and Yongchun counties have successively planted them, hoping to collect a large amount of tobacco donations. It is also said that the tobacco donation in Tongan County has been set at one million yuan. However, it is unknown how the government will deal with it. (October 17)</p>
<h3>Chairman of Hebei Province Wang Shuchang Sworn In</h3>
<p>Tianjin dispatch: Wang Shuchang, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, held a supplementary oath of office ceremony at 10 a.m. on the 17th. Wu Tiecheng was sent by the central government as a representative to Tianjin to supervise the oath. Wu arrived in Tianjin from Shenyang on the morning of the 15th. Today (17th), merchants and residents throughout the city hung flags. Armed posts were added to Dahu Tong and Tianjin Road by the 25th Brigade, presenting a solemn atmosphere. Party and national flags were hung at the gates of the provincial government. In the center of the auditorium hung the portrait and will of the Prime Minister. In front of the ceremonial table were the seats for the chairman and the oath supervisor. The seats for military police were on the left, and the seats for news reporters and various legal groups were on the right. Behind the chairman were the seats for the heads of various departments and the leaders of various institutions. Further behind were the seats for ordinary guests, totaling more than 300 people. Although the heads of the various departments of the provincial government have already taken office, they were not convenient to take the oath with Wang at the same time because they have not yet received appointments from the National Government, and only participated in the ceremony. The one who came to Tianjin by train last night was the Director of Civil Affairs Wang Yuke. The other Director of Finance Yao Hong, Director of Construction Lin Chengxiu, Director of Agriculture and Mining Chang Bingyi, Director of Industry and Commerce He Yufang, and Director of Education Zhang Jian'an all arrived in Tianjin by the early train today. Zhang Xueliang's representative Zhao Ti arrived at 9:20 a.m. Central representative Wu Tiecheng also arrived at 10:10 a.m. and was led to the back building to rest by Chief Receptionist Liu Yunhong. At 10:40 a.m., the guests gathered in the auditorium. After the opening ceremony, Wang Shuchang raised his left hand to take the oath. Next, central representative Wu Tiecheng delivered a speech, roughly stating that today Chairman Wang is taking a supplementary oath. Tiecheng was ordered by Chairman Jiang of the National Government to supervise the oath, and it is a great honor to participate in the grand ceremony. Hebei has suffered from the tyrannical rule of warlords for three years. Yan Xishan recklessly used the remnants of feudalism, disregarded the people, and treated Hebei as a vassal state, taking the wealth of Hebei as an external treasury, levying taxes and grabbing, exhausting the people, and the market was in decline, and the people hated it. The central government felt sorry for the local area, and ordered the troops of the Northeast to enter the customs to fight against the rebels, relieving the people's plight. The rebel party has collapsed, and the people must be actively pacified. Therefore, Chairman Wang was appointed to govern the province, eliminate the tyranny, and reduce the harsh taxes, taking the people out of the water and fire and putting them on the mat, and then implementing the party's doctrine, seeking local construction, promoting autonomy, and gradually reaching the era of constitutional government, so that the people can enjoy peace and happiness. It is not only the fortune of Hebei Province, but also the fortune of the country. I hope that the chairman will work hard to live up to the high expectations of the central government. After Wu finished his speech, Zhao delivered a speech, roughly stating that after the military destruction in Hebei Province, all construction must be carried out in a practical manner. Chairman Wang is knowledgeable and has extensive experience. He will certainly follow the Prime Minister's will, abide by national laws and the Three Principles of the People, not fail the country's trust, and create happiness for the Central Plains. I am here to participate in the ceremony, not only to congratulate Hebei Province on gaining talent, but also to congratulate the future of China. After Zhao finished his speech, Wang delivered a reply, saying that Shuchang was ordered to be the chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, and was encouraged by Mr. Wu Tiecheng, the oath supervisor of the National Government, and General Zhao, the representative of the deputy commander. Shuchang has served in the military and has no experience in politics. He can only follow the instructions, act according to his conscience, and do his best. Moreover, after the military ravages in Hebei Province, everything is waiting to be sorted out. Shuchang is mediocre, but he will do his best. I hope that all the guests will give guidance from time to time. After Wang finished his reply, Wu Tiecheng led the entire audience to shout "Long live the Republic of China" and "Long live Hebei Province", and then took photos and dispersed. (October 17)</p>
<h3>Baker's Handling of Northwest Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>Baker, advisor to the Ministry of Railways, was previously dispatched in February to assist with the China International Famine Relief Commission's relief efforts. He has now returned to Beijing. Regarding the progress of relief efforts in the Northwest provinces, he has prepared a detailed report and submitted it to Minister Sun for review. The following is a transcription of the report:</p>
<p>(Respectful submission to Minister Zhesheng: On February 11th of this year, I was dispatched to Ping (Beijing) to assist with the China International Famine Relief Commission's special relief efforts. The original leave was limited to June, but as matters were not yet completed, it was extended by another month. Now, I respectfully present to you a detailed account of the matters handled and the facts of the progress. When I arrived in Ping and took office as the Director of Relief Efforts for the commission, there was an available fund of 300,000 yuan for relief. The American side hoped for further assistance, as they were still raising funds in the United States, and the fundraising was still in progress. Under these circumstances, the relief plan adopted was largely the same as before. The disaster areas to be aided included Gansu, Shaanxi, Henan, and scattered areas in Shanxi and Shandong provinces. Suiyuan was also a disaster area, but irrigation projects were underway, and some parts had already been completed. With work as relief, the disaster situation could be slightly alleviated. The person in charge of Suiyuan's relief efforts was Mr. Shi Dejun, Mr. J. O. Toad. In Gansu, Reverend Ren Findlay Andrew was in charge. For scattered disaster areas, funds were remitted to local churches for distribution. The disaster situation in Shaanxi was relatively serious, so a branch was specially established in the province to manage and distribute the relief funds. The most difficult province to carry out relief efforts was Henan, where the political situation was extremely chaotic. Although relief was needed, no one was willing to come forward and take responsibility. At that time, the commission had over 600 tons of grain in storage, with about 700 tons more ordered but not yet arrived. The commission originally planned to purchase another 500 tons of mung beans from southern Shanxi and transport them to the disaster areas in Shaanxi by handcart and boat. However, due to problems with the transportation of the aforementioned 1,300 tons of grain, the plan was abandoned. This was because traffic on both the Pinghan and Longhai railways had been suspended. Under these circumstances, the only option was to transport the grain by rail to central Shanxi, then transfer it to trucks for transport south to the Yellow River, and then reload it onto boats for transport to the distribution points. However, after carefully inspecting the truck routes I passed, I realized that before the rainy season, the roads were still in good condition, and about 400 tons could be transported. If more needed to be transported, a large sum of money would have to be spent on purchasing vehicles, and there was no other way. With such delays, how could it be done? I therefore met with representatives from both Feng and Tu's sides, and informed them of the difficulties in relief efforts, requesting that they allow one or two relief cars to be attached to the military trains heading to Shaanxi each day. After several discussions, they agreed to open a special train to transport 500 tons. Seeing that the command of the various armies was not uniform, I also visited military and transportation officials in various places to request cooperation, and spent a great deal of time traveling back and forth. The grain purchased by the commission from the three northeastern provinces, after being transported to Fengtai, had an empty train car delivered to the commission for loading about every two days. A total of 2,000 tons of relief grain was transported to Shishi, the Yellow River terminus of the Hai route. With transportation no longer a problem, the commission contacted Buddhist charitable organizations familiar with relief efforts, and they established five porridge kitchens in western Henan to distribute 117 tons of grain to provide relief. With this effective means of transportation, we accepted as much grain as possible from various charities to transport to the disaster areas. The commission had only purchased a total of 1,300 tons of grain, but 2,000 tons of relief grain was transported to Shishi. The excess 700 tons were from these charitable donations. When the political situation in Shaanxi was extremely chaotic, the Xi'an branch advocated for remitting funds instead of transporting grain, but the grain had already been shipped, and it was impossible to stop. I believed that transporting grain was more appropriate than remitting funds, as it could reduce risks. Subsequent events proved this to be correct, as remittances without guarantees were not a prudent approach. I, seeing the inadequacy of the Xi'an branch in coping with the situation, sought out several people with organizational experience and a deep understanding of China to go to Xi'an to assist or even take charge of matters. Although three people were found, their qualifications were suitable, but it took a great deal of effort. This was because all workers in Shaanxi were regarded as bandits, and the epidemic was raging, so no one dared to try. I accompanied the three hired individuals to Xi'an. After the tasks were assigned, I returned to Beiping to handle various relief matters and resolve the issue of transporting grain to Shaanxi. However, the three previously sent individuals suddenly panicked and refused to stay. This was because banditry was rampant and the epidemic was widespread. One of the three soon resigned, and the other two also left. I had no choice but to personally go to Xi'an to handle relief matters. This was on July 4th of this year. At that time, the Feng army's battle zone had been reduced to a very short range, with a total front line of only 40 miles. Extreme protection was provided for the traffic from Tongguan to Luoyang, and then extended to a point about 50 miles away from Xi'an. In that area, rogue troops were extremely rampant, and merchants along the road were robbed daily, often threatening to cut off traffic to Tongguan. The people of Xi'an called these righteous troops "bandits," but they called themselves "righteous troops." Because travelers were repeatedly robbed by these troops, they had to travel in convoys of cars, escorted by soldiers. Soldiers were in the front and rear of the convoy, providing very tight protection, which reduced the danger somewhat. However, this method was not always reliable, and convoys were often turned back. Later, Liu Yufen ordered the county magistrates of various counties to summon the Red Spears Society and local militias to provide protection, and the banditry subsided. I and my staff, fearing that the relief supplies would also be robbed, went to see the leaders of the righteous troops (who were then in Xingping, which was besieged). The leaders expressed sympathy for the relief efforts and were willing to help, so they sent many guards to escort the supplies, allowing them to reach Xingping and the western disaster areas safely. The Feng army did not prevent this, which was fortunate. We originally intended to organize work teams to provide work as relief, so that the heads of households could earn wages to support their families. At the beginning of the organization, young farmers dared not join, as they were afraid of being forced into military service. However, both the Feng army and the anti-Feng army prohibited organized work teams from crossing their borders. We had no choice but to stop work in easily detected locations and instead focus on construction near the workers' homes. The construction plan at that time was to first improve the road from Xi'an to Tongguan, then to dredge ditches, and then to improve the highway from Xi'an west to the Gansu border. On the above roads, there were many streams, and the slopes varied from 12% to 30%. These slopes have now been uniformly reduced to 7%. In addition, several bridges were repaired, several river embankments were paved, and 5,000 miles of highways were added. The above projects should have been completed one after another by now. A few days before leaving Xi'an, I went with hydraulic engineer Mr. Ellison and several Chinese engineers and government officials to observe the site of a former irrigation structure built during the Three Kingdoms period. Some people have proposed tunneling through the mountain and building a sluice gate across the Jing River, so that the fields of Jingyang, Sanyuan, and Gaoling counties would be fully irrigated and free from drought and flood. However, later generations have argued about this, and no consensus has been reached. According to our observations, tunneling through the mountain would require a huge amount of money, which is beyond the current or recent financial situation. A compromise solution would be to build a dam on the river and enlarge the waterway rebuilt 300 years ago, and build several branch streams, so that the water storage capacity could irrigate at least 100,000 acres of farmland. A survey team has now been sent to investigate, and materials for this project have been ordered. The recruitment of workers is probably underway. The total cost of the project is estimated to be about 750,000 yuan, or perhaps more. The China International Famine Relief Commission currently has 350,000 yuan in funds. The commission intends to use this money for this project, which is the intention of the commission members. Relief funds will continue to arrive, so that the project can be completed. Many charitable organizations support the commission. For example, the North China Famine Relief Commission has allocated a large amount of relief funds to the commission for the construction of highways. That commission still has 200,000 yuan in relief funds. The total amount of the two commissions is not enough for this project, and it is also a huge difference from the Shaanxi relief funds for this winter. Therefore, alternative solutions must be found. Last year, there were 42 disaster areas in Shaanxi. Among them, 30 have had a very good harvest this year, which is a fact. However, the remaining 12 are located in the foothills of low-lying areas, and their plight is actually worse than last year. Although there has been a large amount of rainfall in the Wei River area, there has been very little rainfall from the first mountain range to the north of the Wei River. On August 1st of this year, locusts caused further damage, increasing the affected area by 20 miles. In total, the length is probably no less than 200 miles. The previous population of these 12 disaster areas was about 2 million, but now there are only 900,000. If no relief is provided, after winter, there will inevitably be another 600,000 deaths. The residents of the area are displaced and in extreme distress. Three-quarters of the residents' houses have been destroyed.</p>
<p>There is not a single tile left, and the wood has been sold off. Every day, 300 to 400 handcarts are loaded with this wood and sold in Xi'an. Another group of residents are selling all their household items to pay for their migration to find more fertile land. As for how to feed the aforementioned 600,000 disaster victims, maintaining them until the next harvest will take a long time and cost a lot. If each person is given 12 ounces of grain per day, the cost will be about 7 to 8 million yuan. The only solution now is to provide work as relief, so that the money is not wasted and both water conservancy and highways can be developed. If more mountain roads can be built, the province's coal mines can be developed, creating wealth (the current price of coal in Xi'an is about 67 yuan per ton). With commercial prosperity, the four classes of people will not suffer from unemployment, bandits will have no way to arise, and local order will be easily restored. I sincerely hope that you will convey the disaster situation in various places and the suffering of the people to the relief authorities, and ask them to work with all charitable organizations to seek relief. The current situation in the province is very different from the summer. Many highways have been expanded, and water conservancy has been improved, so it is no longer as lifeless as before. The commission's goods lost due to banditry amount to several hundred yuan in cash, six bags of beans, and vehicles that were robbed three times. The drivers' clothing and money were all taken away. However, vehicles escorted by Westerners have never been intercepted. I carried 50,000 yuan in cash, and although it passed through areas occupied by bandits, it was not robbed, which was fortunate. The amount spent by me this time totaled 1.25 million yuan, of which 600,000 yuan was used in Shaanxi, 500,000 yuan in Gansu, 100,000 yuan in Henan, and the remainder was used in smaller disaster areas scattered throughout the region. The commission's work teams were never forced into military service, nor did anyone die from the epidemic. This is a general overview of my handling of relief efforts.)</p>

<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Kidnapped Child Fortunately Rescued: Duan Guan, the son of Tao Bohe, who resides in Zhongtao Lane, South Street, was taken out to play by his cook, Sun A'guan, at 3:00 PM on the 21st. Unexpectedly, he had not returned by 8:00 PM that evening. The family was alarmed and worried about other possibilities, so they reported to the Public Security Bureau's Detective Team for investigation. Captain Wang dispatched detectives to investigate and temporarily detained A'guan's wife, Sheng, and his friend, Ni A'lin. There was no news that night. At 8:00 AM on the 22nd, Sun A'guan suddenly returned to Kunshan by rickshaw with Duan Guan. The detectives arrested Sun and notified the Tao family to take the child home. Captain Wang interrogated Sun A'guan. According to him, yesterday he took the young master (Duan Guan) out to play on the street. Suddenly, two people came, pulled out pistols, and threatened him to follow them. He had no choice but to follow them to the Luxiabang Station and then take a train to Shanghai. Fortunately, he met a friend named "Little Tiger" at the Shanghai station, who dispersed the two men. He then sent him to the Baodai Society on Sanma Road for the night, and returned to Kunshan this morning. Captain Wang, finding the story inconsistent, submitted it to the General Bureau for county-level interrogation.</p>
<p>Third District Clearing of Public Property: The county's Third District is formed by the organization of the old Anting and Luxiabang townships. It has 1,000 mu of public property land, most of which is held by individuals. After the former District Chief Yang took office, he began to clear it up. However, because the town head of Huajiaqiao and others wanted to compete for it as township property, he resigned repeatedly and had not fully recovered it. It was resolved at the eighth district affairs meeting to continue the previous method and order the township heads to investigate and report. It is also reported that more than 20 town heads of Anting and others have jointly submitted a petition to the county government and the Department of Civil Affairs requesting a thorough investigation. The Third District Party Department also resolved at the recent general meeting of party members</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>, and submitted a petition to the County Party Department to transfer it to the county government, ordering the Third District Office to thoroughly investigate the matter.</p>
<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>Major Opium Case Cracked: Chen Pansheng, a native of this county, has no legitimate business. The other night, he was carrying a package and wanted to leave the North Gate by steamboat. However, because of his flustered appearance, he aroused the suspicion of the gate guard, who ordered him to put it down for inspection. Sixty packets of opium were found, and he was immediately taken to the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the county government for interrogation. The suspect, knowing that the赃物 were all there, could not deny it and confessed to trafficking opium. The judge, in view of the strict prohibition orders, dared to smuggle a large amount of opium, which was extremely illegal, sentenced him to three years and six months in prison and fined him 3,000 yuan. If he is unable to pay, he will be allowed to offset each three yuan with one day of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Wujiang</h3>
<p>Pingwang Seizes Rice Boat Leaving the Border: The former Rice Inspection Station of Pingwang District in this county, located at the intersection of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, seized a rice boat leaving the border from the Yuanfengtai Rice Shop in Pingwang Town, carrying more than 70 shi of brown rice. It was immediately sent to the county, where the judge interrogated him. He confessed to transporting it to Shanghai for sale, but denied transporting it to Zhejiang Province.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Water Police Come to Town to Arrest Bandits: Xu Pucheng, the head of the Second District of the Zhejiang Water Police, under the secret order of Hang Yi, the commander-in-chief of the Jiahu Bandit Suppression, took a warship to Xiaodongmen within this city and arrested Li Zhonghua, the head of the gang. He was taken aboard the warship that day and sent to the Jiaxing Command Headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Appoints Two More County Magistrates: Zheng Chengyuan, the former magistrate of Liyang County, was dismissed for owing a large sum of money. Recently, the provincial government appointed Yuan Guanying, a section member of the Finance Department, to succeed him. In addition, Xia Yueqing, the magistrate of Qidong County, was transferred to the province for further appointment. Zhou Juesheng, the chief of the Sixth Section of the Department of Agriculture and Mines, was appointed to fill the vacant position. The two new county magistrates, Yuan and Zhou, have taken office after receiving their orders.</p>
<p>Huaian Middle School Comes to the Province to Avoid Bandits: Wang Delin, the principal of Jiangsu Provincial Huaian Middle School, recently reported that the bandits in the county were rampant and approaching the county seat, making it difficult to hold classes. Therefore, he led all the faculty, staff, students, and Boy Scouts, totaling more than 170 people, to the province by boat the other day. They are now staying at Zhenjiang Middle School to temporarily avoid the banditry. He also petitioned the Department of Education to transfer it to the provincial government to send troops to aid the county in order to restore the area as soon as possible and avoid wasting their studies.</p>
<p>Another Police School Student Commits Suicide: Graduates of the first undergraduate class of the Police Academy have been assigned to various counties to wait for assignments. There are still many who have not been appointed to positions. In the previous case of the tragic murder of Miao Wencai in Jiangyin, whether it was suicide or murder has not yet been revealed. Tang Gaosong, a student assigned to Taixian County to wait for an assignment, had been waiting in the county for a long time and was appointed as the leader of the police team by the county, but he did not know. Because he was extremely resentful of the world, he suddenly had the idea of ​​dying, so he committed suicide at home, which is very regrettable.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Liyang County Bureau Chief Escorted to the Province: Following reports that Zheng Chengyuan, the magistrate of Liyang County, colluded with Pan Bin, the director of the Finance Bureau, to collect land taxes improperly, citizens, including Di, reported the matter to the provincial departments. After investigation, the provincial government sent officials and police to escort Zheng Chengyuan, Pan Bin, and Shen Zhiqin and Cao Qingzhi, important officials involved in the corruption, to the province for detention. The vacant position of Director of the Finance Bureau has been filled by Pan Keping, appointed by the Finance Department. The magistrate's position will be temporarily filled by You Bingzhao, the director of the Public Security Bureau, by order of Hu, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs. Hu then submitted it to the provincial government meeting, which resolved to appoint Yuan Guanying as the acting magistrate of Liyang County. Yuan will take office within a few days after receiving the appointment.</p>
<p>Petition for Relief of Judicial Expenses: The government of Xiyi County also handles judicial affairs, and its expenses are not very sufficient. All kinds of equipment are simple and crude. Since Magistrate Pan took office, he has been shorted 7-800 yuan in two months. He specially drafted two measures to seek relief: (1) Qin Ren would be issued a monthly subsidy of 200 yuan from the fines and requested to be included in the regular expenses and disbursed by the High Court; (2) or this 200 yuan would be allocated from the judicial writing fees to secure funds. If the above two points cannot be approved, the only option is to lay off employees and reduce salaries to suit the specified expenses and avoid compensation.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>County Cleanup Committee Warns Cheng Qing Bao: The County Cleanup Committee issued a warning to the Cheng Qing Bao yesterday (the day of the story), because the newspaper's report of the Jiang Hong case was untrue. The original order stated that after the Jiang case occurred, the society was in turmoil. Those against Jiang gloated and exaggerated the words, using all means to add insult to injury. Those who supported Jiang ran around day and night, trying to deny it. Telegrams and memorials almost made the paper expensive, and the discussions were mixed. The committee is in the process of investigating this case. Although Jiangyin's Shanghai fellow villagers and Cao Jingshan and others have repeatedly defended Jiang Hong and asked to be released on bail, it will not be swayed by any clever words and will seek the truth as the standard for decision-making. At the 26th Weekly Memorial Service for the Premier, Commissioners Gao and Meng reported that they firmly stated that they would not express their attitude on the Jiang case while it was under investigation. The newspaper’s local news column on the 20th of this month stated that the case was部白, and said that the County Cleanup Committee had conducted several investigations and found that it was the same as the situation presented by Jiang Hong, etc., which was extremely mistaken. If it is not an untrue record, it is another intention. Otherwise, what did the rumor catch and what did it say? Such stupidity should not be found in the world of public opinion, let alone in the newspapers guided by the committee. It is very inappropriate. It should have been severely punished to serve as a warning to others and to rectify the public opinion. Considering the first offense, it should be given a serious warning. The editor, Lu Shangquan, was derelict in his duty and should be given a major demerit to observe the effect. If he does not repent, he will be dismissed without pardon.</p>
<h3>Tongnan</h3>
<p>Township Cleanup Bureau Captures Bandits and Escorts Them to the Province for Interrogation: Tongyi County is conducting township cleanup, starting with bandit areas. Because the funds are insufficient, no department is set up under the director and deputy director. Only one township cleanup director is set up, and Hu Tianmin is appointed to fill the position. Bandits arrested in each district are pre-tried and then escorted to the Provincial Bandit Suppression Command for interrogation. The 31st Rear Hospital is Abolished: The 31st Rear Hospital in Nantong was ordered to be abolished by the General Headquarters. The 480 wounded soldiers currently living in the hospital were transferred to the Rear Hospital in Hangzhou under the command of Deputy Adjutant Rong.</p>
<p>Police Warship Goes to Yancheng to Suppress Bandits: The remnants of Ma Yuren and Shen Guanxi's bandits have not been quelled in the coastal area of ​​Yancheng. The Department of Civil Affairs dispatched the Fuyan police warship to jointly suppress them with the warships of Jia Lu and Hong Ping. They sailed north from the Yunyan River on the 21st. The Fireworks Industry Appeals for Maintaining Livelihood: The fireworks industry in Tongruhai counties has recently been struggling due to the curfew imposed during the bandit suppression, which prohibits the setting off of fireworks. They appealed to the county government to maintain their livelihood. The county government has ordered the districts to handle the matter as appropriate.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Water Police Inspector Seizes Large Amount of Firearms: Ding Guangqi, Inspector No. 5 of the Second Squadron of the Provincial Public Security Team, inspected ships at Huangtiangang Port yesterday (21st) at 11:00 AM and saw a small sampan with suspicious behavior. Inspector Ding boarded the ship for inspection and found 97 rifles without wooden shells, 8 carbines without wooden shells, and 259 miscellaneous parts in three hidden compartments. The shipowner, Shi Chunsheng (from Yancheng), and the sailors, Sun Zehai and Sun Baishuang (from Funing), were sent to the squadron headquarters for questioning by Squadron Leader Shen Hualong and then sent to the county for handling. It is heard that the firearms were unearthed from the mud in Huangdu and were transported to the Yanfu area of ​​Jiangbei for use by Ma Yuren's troops. The firearms are badly rusted and seem to have been left in the mud, perhaps during the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War. Whether this is true or not remains to be determined by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Two Thieves Arrested in Qiancun Robbery Case: Zheng Peizhou, the director of the Ninth Branch of the Wuyi Butou Public Security Bureau, arrested Tao Qinrong, a bandit in the Qiancun robbery case. After preliminary interrogation, he confessed that there were accomplices hiding near Benniu. Director Zheng then escorted the Tao suspect to the city and, together with Tang Renjie, the director of the First Branch, went to the Second Branch in Benniu and joined forces with Director Wei to arrest the bandit Ren Sanlang and recovered a number of stolen goods. They were all escorted to the city and handed over to the county for interrogation by the two directors, Tang and Zheng, on the afternoon of the 21st.</p>
<p>Kidnapped Hostage Released After Ransom Paid: The son of Chen Zhaofu, a farmer in Wangtianli Village, Wenyong Township, Third District of Wuyi County, has been kidnapped by bandits for many days. Zhaofu entrusted someone to negotiate with the bandits in Laoguqiao and agreed on a ransom of 1,350 yuan. 1,150 yuan was paid, and 200 yuan was still owed. The payment date was agreed upon. After the payment, the bandits sent the hostage out by the riverbank there the night before and said that they were not afraid that you would not pay the owed money.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>The case of Feng Suqing being abducted still requires a retrial. In this city, Yao Tianlin from outside the city managed to marry Feng, whose maiden name was Suqing. In August of the year before last, she was lured and abducted to Fengtian by her friend Liu Dianxun to work as a prostitute and sold for 600 foreign dollars, and her name was changed to Liu Yueqin. Yao suddenly received a letter from his wife stating the circumstances of being lured and sold into prostitution by Liu. She now wants to return to Yangzhou but cannot. After receiving the letter, Yao submitted a document to the county government and the Public Security Bureau requesting that Liu be arrested and interrogated. When Liu was summoned for interrogation, he firmly denied it. Later, after someone provided bail, the county government sent a letter to the Fengtian court requesting that Feng Suqing be summoned for questioning. It was confirmed that Liu had abducted her. A reply has now been sent to the county, and the county government has transferred it to the court for handling. It is now known that the court reconvened the original plaintiffs and defendants today (the 21st) for a hearing. Unexpectedly, the defendant did not appear, resulting in no outcome. It is said that the presiding judge instructed the plaintiff, Yao Tianlin, to return and wait for Liu to be arrested before further interrogation.</p>
<p>The Court Investigates the Education Bureau's Stolen Document Case. Previously, due to the case of the Jiangdu Education Bureau's junior high school account books being stolen, the Public Security Bureau and the county government repeatedly interrogated Chen Shusen, the document management officer, and Pan Da, a clerk. Subsequently, County Magistrate Chen recorded the confessions and sent the above three people to the court prosecutor's office for a hearing. Yesterday (the 20th), Lu, the prosecutor in charge of the case, accompanied by a clerk and bailiffs, went to the Education Bureau to conduct an on-site inspection, and took the handkerchief, screw starter, and other items left by the document thief to the court as an aid to the investigation. This was in the morning. In the afternoon, the prosecutor's office reopened the court and released Pan Da, who was considered to be more suspicious, on bail. Around 6 o'clock, Zhou Yangzhi, a secretary in the county government, was suddenly arrested. When Zhou was arrested, the bailiffs believed that Hou Maolin, who lived with Zhou, was obstructing official duties and hiding the defendant. Prosecutor Lu then separately prosecuted these two crimes in court and ordered Zhou's detention. Zhou's family then went to Principal Bao's home at the junior high school to make a scene. Bao then went to the court to request that Zhou be released on bail pending trial. Prosecutor Lu met him and told him that Zhou's suspicion was serious and that he could not be released on bail. If he had any opinions, he could state them in court. Today (the 21st), Prosecutor Lu again led police officers to Principal Bao's home and Zhou Yangzhi's residence for separate searches. The case is now being accepted and tried by the court.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>Reactionary Suspects Arrested. Xu Xianhan and Rong Yousong, residents of Shangde City in this county, have been reported for suspected reactionary activities. County Magistrate Shen has ordered the Director of the Public Security Bureau to arrest Xu and others for interrogation.</p>
<p>Bandits Attempt to Rob the Beijing-Shanghai Train, Causing Disaster. The night before last, when the Beijing-Shanghai night express train arrived at Xinfeng Station, bandits lurking at the rear of the train threatened to stop the train in an attempted robbery. When that failed, they shot and killed a baggage handler and wounded a train guard. After the incident, they jumped off the train to escape, but fell and fainted due to the speed of the train. The train stopped at the station in this county. The garrison troops stationed at the station rushed to the scene, found the bandits responsible for the incident, and sent them to the provincial capital for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Jingjiang</h3>
<p>Sending Personnel to Rugao to Negotiate Bandit Suppression. The county government believes that bandit suppression is difficult because this county is adjacent to Rugao County. It plans to send Secretary Ge Tianyi to negotiate.</p>
<p>Bandits Surrendering One After Another. Notorious bandits Bian Tangyu and Zhang Er and others have been looting in partnership at Xibaimuqiao and Sidunzi on the border between Jingjiang and Taixing. Now that Li Jigeng and his like have already surrendered themselves, they have also gone to the Taixing County government, found guarantors, and surrendered their weapons.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Civil Affairs Department Appoints and Dismisses Three County Magistrates. Cheng Zhenjun, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee member and acting Director of the Civil Affairs Department, has paid close attention to the county governments and is particularly strict in examining the diligence of the county magistrates. At the recent 348th Provincial Government meeting, he proposed to replace three county magistrates, which was approved.

<p>A Daytime Robbery Occurs at the City Station. Li Xilin, a partner in the Changxing Printing House in Hangzhou, ordered Xie Zhaosong, the shop's clerk, to withdraw 50 foreign dollars from a draft at the city station post office yesterday. After Zhao Song withdrew the money from the post office at 3 PM, a bandit named Ding Lida suddenly rushed up, grabbed the banknotes from his pocket, and fled. Zhao Song grabbed him and shouted for help. A police officer heard the call, stepped forward, and arrested him. After interrogation by Huang Zucheng, a staff member, it was revealed that there were three accomplices: Li Honggen and Chen Yunsheng, all residing at No. 22, Huayang Hotel at the City Station. According to the confession, Huang sent Inspector Miao and Police Officer Zhang to investigate and arrest them, but they had already fled. That night, the bandit was sent to the Public Security Bureau for handling.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Scheduled to Return to Fenghua. Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government, will return to his ancestral home in Fenghua on a fixed date to inspect his family tomb and survey the Yin-Feng Highway. Jiang, the supervisor of the Ou Hai Customs, and Mao, the Director of the Ningbo Public Security Bureau, also went to Nanjing to inquire about the date of his trip. According to news from Nanjing, Chairman Chiang originally planned to return to Zhejiang immediately, but because all sectors of the capital have scheduled a welcome rally for his triumphant return today (the 22nd) and require his personal attendance, he has decided to go from Nanjing to Shanghai tomorrow (the 23rd) and then take a boat back to his ancestral home in Fenghua.</p>
<p>The Security Corps Attacks a Large Band of Bandits. Since the anti-rebellion case occurred in Fenghua County, the bandits have become rampant and widespread. Three hundred bandits even swarmed to the Cai area the other day, with rumors spreading of an impending attack. Upon receiving this news, the county government ordered the Security Corps to mobilize various squads from all directions to suppress them. At Cai, they found more than 300 bandits, all armed with guns, no different from a regular army. The bandit leaders, Qiu Wenqing, claimed to be the commander of the newly formed Sixth Division; Chen Shunchang claimed to be the commander of the Third Brigade; and Sun Libiao claimed to be the commander of the Fourth Brigade. They also distributed notices stating their intention to attack the city. However, the bandits' firearms were all short guns and Mausers, making it difficult to fight. When the Security Corps arrived, the bandits fled towards Chen Gongling. The Security Corps attacked from behind, killing three bandits and capturing a bandit scout, Huang Tusheng. After interrogation, he revealed the location of several bandit dens. The Security Corps has secretly searched them.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from Tian Yueqiu of Yangzhou</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Having read the Yangzhou correspondence column in your newspaper on October 19th, which stated that "(Tian Yueqiu, the director of Tianye Hospital, was implicated because a suspected Communist, so and so, testified in court that he had conspired with Tian," this is inconsistent with the facts. The truth is that Yang Disheng, the executive committee member of the second branch of the first district of Gongjin Township in Jiangdu County, was sued in the High Court. After a thorough interrogation, all allegations were found to be baseless and the case was returned to the Jiangdu County Court for investigation into whether there was incitement of others to resist rent. After the county court summoned him for questioning, Yang was ordered to post bail. Yueqiu and Yang had a teacher-student relationship in the past, so Yueqiu acted as Yang's guarantor. On the day of the court hearing, Yang was unable to arrive due to unforeseen circumstances. The judge immediately issued a warrant for the arrest of the guarantor. However, the bailiff, not understanding the case, used a gun to coerce him and handcuffed his hands, acting as if he were arresting a thief. When the judge inquired about the guarantee, he ordered him to submit a deadline for handing over Yang. Yueqiu then realized that he had been illegally arrested. He asked the judge to explain the meaning of the bailiff's use of a gun and handcuffs. After questioning the bailiff, the judge agreed to give him appropriate punishment. This is the truth about Yueqiu's illegal arrest. I hereby submit this letter requesting that your newspaper make a correction to clarify the facts and distinguish right from wrong. Tian Yueqiu, Yangzhou, October 21st.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Receiving Labor University</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education Implements a Strict Attitude Toward Receiving</p>
<p>The School Affairs Council Telegraphed the National Government to Send a Principal Quickly</p>
<p>Students Welcome the Receiving Personnel to Arrive at the School</p>
<p>Zhu Baoqin, Xie Shuying, Zhuang Quan, and three other members of the Ministry of Education’s Labor University Inspection Committee stationed in Shanghai, were commissioned by the Ministry as special commissioners to receive Labor University, and ordered to go to receive it immediately. If the school refused to obey and resisted the order, it would be ordered to shut down. The Shanghai Municipal Government also received a telegram from the Ministry of Education, requesting that the police be dispatched to assist Zhu, Xie, and Zhuang, the three receiving commissioners, in handling the receiving matters when necessary.</p>
<p>The School Affairs Council Telegraphed to Quickly Appoint a Principal. The problem of the principal of the National Labor University has not been resolved. The School Affairs Council of the school telegraphed to the government and the executive yuan, requesting the quick appointment of a principal. The full text of the two telegrams is as follows: "To the Honorable President of the Executive Yuan of the Nanjing National Government, Due to the resignation of the former principal of the affiliated school, we have repeatedly telegraphed to your honorable Yuan requesting the appointment of a successor. We are grateful for your examination of the school affairs of the affiliated school, which is now maintained by the School Affairs Council. We are deeply concerned that we cannot overcome the heavy responsibilities and numerous affairs. We earnestly request that your honorable Yuan consider the expectations of all teachers and students of the affiliated school and appoint a new principal as soon as possible, so that the responsibility can be assigned to facilitate school affairs. We await your orders. The School Affairs Council of the National Labor University respectfully kowtows." Ma also telegraphed, "To the Honorable Minister Jiang of the Nanjing Ministry of Education, We previously received Order No. 1042 from your honorable Ministry, dispatching personnel to the school to verify the records. We immediately complied with the order and prepared various forms and registers for verification. Suddenly, this telegram changed the verification to the receiving of the affiliated school by teachers and students, which caused great confusion. They all said that before the new principal is appointed, there is no need to send personnel to receive. We earnestly request that your honorable Ministry withdraw the order to receive and maintain the original verification plan. We pray without end. The School Affairs Council of the National Labor University respectfully kowtows."</p>
<p>Students Welcome the Ministry of Education to Receive. After the Ministry of Education announced the reception of Labor University, the students of the school were extremely excited. Yesterday, the entire student body of the College of Engineering issued a statement expressing their welcome to the news of the reception by the teachers. It was reported that more than 70 students attended the general meeting of the members to discuss the results, and they also expressed their welcome. Later, a small number of people bought out by the school authorities tried to sabotage it, resulting in the inability to publish the news. The College of Agriculture is farther away and the news is later, so there is no statement yet, but according to the news from the students of the college, the majority also welcome the reception by the Ministry of Education and will take consistent action with the two colleges of Engineering and the Social Sciences.</p>
<p>Zhuang Quan Fills the Position of Dean of the College of Engineering. The position of Dean of the College of Engineering of the National Labor University has been vacant for a long time. The affiliated factory of the school has more than ten factories. Recently, Zhuang Quan was hired by the Ministry of Education as the dean. Zhuang graduated from Tongji University and studied at the Dresden University of Technology in Germany, achieving the best grades among Chinese students. He has served as the director of the Hanyang Arsenal, the Northeast Arsenal, and the Machine Factory. He is currently the director of the Machine Factory of the Shanghai Arsenal. Minister Jiang Menglin borrowed him from Director Chen Gongxia for the position.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Education Bureau Holds Private School Testing</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau believes that many private elementary schools have been registered. In order to understand the achievements of each school and study the standards of various testing materials, the Testing Section of the Research Department has planned to conduct four standard tests. Ding Zhongxuan, Xu Dingjun, He Yuanzhi, Huang Sen, Shen Yuguang, and Huang Zhen were assigned as testing staff to go to various schools for testing on October 20th. Forty-two schools participated in the testing.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Education Bureau Bans the Private Benefit-the-People Free School</h3>
<p>Private schools in this city often use the beautiful name of enthusiasm for education to solicit donations everywhere. The Municipal Education Bureau has ordered a ban on file. Now, the Benefit-the-People Obligation School has been accused of false donations to the bureau. The bureau has sent personnel to investigate and found the following report: "The Benefit-the-People Obligation School on Maigen Road, Tonghe Lane, in the British Concession has two female teachers who go to the British and French Concessions to solicit donations from door to door. A receipt was also found. On October 18th, I went to the school to investigate and inquired with nearby residents. I learned that the school has two classrooms and more than 60 students. There are ten teachers and staff members, seven men and three women. The expenses are 1,800 yuan per year. The income is 400 yuan per year in tuition fees, and the rest is donated by female teachers Wang Qin and others. A receipt was found, but when compared with the original receipt, the style was different and the seal color was also different. After repeated inquiries, they insisted that the school only had one type of receipt. It is thought that outsiders knew that the school was going to solicit donations, so they impersonated it. I also found that the content of the school's curriculum was not in accordance with regulations, and the facilities were simple, like a private school. Moreover, the school charges tuition fees and calls it 'obligation,' which is obviously a way to deceive. Furthermore, the school has two classrooms and ten teachers. When I went to the school to investigate, I only saw Teacher Peng Kangnian at the school. When asked about the other teachers, he said, 'Only I teach on Saturdays.' The corruption of the school can be imagined. In this situation, we should send a letter to the Special District Court to strictly ban it to prevent outsiders from being fooled." It is now known that the bureau has decided to do so.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Western Football Association Investigates the Suspicion That the Members of the Expedition Team Are Salaried</h3>
<p>丨Organize a Special Committee... Please Invite the China Sports Association to Participate丨</p>
<p>The Chinese Expedition Football Team organized by the Yuehua Sports Association originally planned to unite the athletes of Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Singapore to conquer the United States. Later, when the team was waiting for the ship in Singapore, they suddenly received a reply from the British Football Association rejecting them. The team then turned around and returned home. It is said that the reason for the rejection was that the team was suspected of violating the amateur sports. After returning home, the Hong Kong Football Association reviewed Cao Guicheng and Chen Guangyao, two members of the team. As a result, all three had salaried actions and were disqualified from the competition. The Shanghai Western Football Association also discussed this incident at the Executive Committee meeting on the 21st and decided to invite two people from the China National Sports Promotion Association and the association to form an independent committee to conduct research and review the matter.

<p>Chairman Chiang of the National Government, after his triumphant return from the front, was long expected to return to his ancestral home in Fenghua. According to reliable sources, Chairman Chiang is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today (the 23rd). Various circles in the city, in recognition of Chairman Chiang's meritorious service in eliminating rebels and rescuing the people from suffering, have initiated a welcome rally. It is reported that the City Party Headquarters and the Chamber of Commerce have initiated the preparations. The City Party Headquarters has appointed Pan Gongzhan, Fan Zhengbo, Wang Yansong, Wu Kaixian, and Hou Dachun as preparatory members. The Chamber of Commerce has also appointed Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Ye Huijun, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Jilun, and Zheng Chengqing as preparatory members. The date is said to be set for the afternoon of the 24th of this month at the Chamber of Commerce. Preparations are currently underway.</p>
<p>A telegram from Nanjing states that Chiang and Soong Mei-ling will travel to Shanghai by train on the night of the 22nd, accompanied by Chief Wang of the Guard, Secretary Xiong, and adjutants and attendants. A special carriage No. 1 and first, second, and third class carriages have been booked. Those seeing them off at the station included Gu Zhenglun and others. It is reported that Chiang's trip is to visit Madame Soong, and he plans to stay in Shanghai for one or two days before returning to Fenghua. He is expected to return to Nanjing in about a week. Wang Zhengting and Liu Jiwen also traveled to Shanghai by train on the night of the 22nd.</p>

<h3>Party Members Expelled from the Party Lose Their Civil Rights</h3>
<p>The Same Applies to Party Members Suspended from Party Rights</p>
<p>The Municipal Government issued instructions to its subordinate bureaus, municipal committee offices, and the Preparatory Committee for the Implementation of the Municipal Organization Law yesterday, stating: "For your information, we have received Instruction No. 3655 from the Executive Yuan, which states: 'We have received Letter No. 15670 from the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee, which states (regarding the difference between expulsion from the Party, suspension of Party rights, and deprivation of civil rights, and whether those who have been expelled from the Party or suspended from Party rights have the civil rights stipulated in Article 7 of the Law on the Implementation of Township Autonomy, and the right to be elected as the head of a township, neighborhood, or village, please forward to us for review and reply, so that we can instruct compliance). After investigation, Article 81 of the General Regulations stipulates that party members who have been expelled from the Party shall not serve in the government agencies of this party. This meaning was interpreted by the 33rd Standing Committee Meeting of the Third Central Committee in September of the 18th year as being similar to the deprivation of civil rights due to criminal punishment under the criminal law. The reason for saying 'similar' rather than 'the same' is that the reasons and procedures for party discipline and judicial punishment are inherently different. However, in terms of their effect, there is no difference. This is a natural interpretation. Furthermore, the term 'government agencies of this party' includes all central and local government agencies, or local autonomous organizations, such as townships, neighborhoods, and villages, as indicated in Items 1 and 2 of the previous interpretation. There is no doubt about this. While the suspension of Party rights differs from expulsion from the Party, its nature is essentially the same as the restoration of civil rights after deprivation. Therefore, in this regard, the same sanctions should be imposed as on those who have been expelled from the Party, in order to ensure fairness. Furthermore, Article 7 of the Law on the Implementation of Township Autonomy stipulates that citizens of the Republic of China who have been sworn in and registered as township citizens have the right to attend township or town meetings and to exercise the rights of election, recall, initiative, and referendum. The essence of the oath is to swear to uphold the Three Principles of the People and adopt the Five-Power Constitution. Therefore, those who have been subjected to party discipline, expelled from the Party, or are within the period of suspension of Party rights cannot be considered loyal to the principles of this party, and it is difficult to expect them to fulfill their civic oath. It can be inferred that they should not be allowed to enjoy the civil rights of this article. It was resolved at the 110th Standing Committee Meeting of the Central Committee (party members who have been expelled from the Party or suspended from Party rights are no different from those deprived of civil rights and shall not enjoy the civil rights stipulated in Article 7 of the Law on the Implementation of Township Autonomy, and the right to be elected as the head of a township, neighborhood, or village). In addition to being distributed separately, a copy of the case is sent to you for your information and for distribution to your subordinates for their information.' In accordance with this, in addition to distributing it separately, we hereby order the city to inform the lower levels and instruct them to comply accordingly. This is the order."</p>
<h3>Garrison Troops Search for Deserters</h3>
<p>Nine Deserters Arrested</p>
<p>The Fifth Division, stationed in Shanghai for nearly three years, is well-trained and known to the public for its excellent discipline. Recently, individuals in nearby counties, disregarding the overall situation, have been encouraging soldiers of the division to desert in order to replenish the police force in the counties. Commander Xiong has repeatedly issued orders strictly prohibiting this. However, many soldiers have still deserted to Chongming, Songjiang, Qidong, and other counties. In order to maintain military discipline, Commander Xiong was forced to order Xiong Kexi, the battalion commander stationed in Wusong, to lead the 5th Company of his battalion to Chongming County to search for deserters as a warning to others. Upon hearing that Xiong's battalion was coming, the county had already made preparations, intending to quickly move the police force out of the county seat. Those who came to investigate would hide the Jiangxi police officers (most of the soldiers of the Fifth Division are from Jiangxi). They also feared that a roll call would be taken during the search, so they prepared to hire people to answer in their place. Their intention to collude with deserters is obvious. Battalion Commander Xiong received a confidential report and immediately went to meet with County Magistrate Liang, requesting that the deserters be handed over. Liang refused to hand them over immediately, using the excuse of going to suppress bandits in the western countryside the next morning. Xiong believed that County Magistrate Liang was insincere and led his troops to search the police force. The police initially resisted, but were soon surrounded. As a result, nine deserters were arrested. Afterwards, Battalion Commander Xiong discussed the aftermath with County Magistrate Liang and Long, the captain of the 17th Team of the 4th District of the Water Police. He also dispatched subordinates to patrol the streets to prevent unscrupulous individuals from taking the opportunity to cause trouble. He also gave a speech to the public, saying that he was sorry for the sudden and brief alarm, explaining that he was under orders to search for deserters. Before the troops returned to the City God Temple to rest, he had the company line up for County Magistrate Liang and representatives from various public organizations to inspect the soldiers to see if there was any illegal behavior during the search for deserters. The various public organizations believed that the measures taken were appropriate and praised Battalion Commander Xiong for his quick action. It is reported that the company returned to Wusong to be stationed the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau Reorganization Committee to be Established Soon</h3>
<p>Zhang Qun Difficult to Decline Chairmanship</p>
<p>The proposal to nationalize the Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau has been passed by the Central Political Conference, which has decided that the government will buy out the shares of the merchants. A reporter from the New Voice Society visited Secretary-General Song Shuqiao of the Bureau yesterday to inquire about everything. According to Song, since the nature of the Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau has been determined by the Central Government, the Party can now begin to reorganize it. As for the merchant shares, an investigation must be conducted first. The price of the shares will depend on the assets of the Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau. This will be determined by the Reorganization Committee. The establishment of the Bureau's debt reorganization committee and equity reorganization committee are administrative measures. According to Director-General Li, upon his return to Shanghai, he met with Chairman Chiang. Chairman Chiang earnestly urged Zhang Qun, the head of the Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau Reorganization Committee, not to resign, which he is expected to decline. In order to actively reorganize the Bureau, Director-General Li has decided to convene a discussion meeting with the members of the Reorganization Committee every Wednesday afternoon in order to gather ideas and benefit from collective wisdom. The committee is expected to be established soon, and the members will be able to take office soon. Regarding the case of corruption by the branch director in Hankou, in addition to ordering the accounting department to cancel the extra reward money, Director-General Li has also insisted on strict punishment. The newly appointed branch director, Li Yunliang, is scheduled to take office in Hankou tomorrow (today).</p>
<h3>Shanghai Establishes Warehousing Fund Raising Committee</h3>
<p>Thirty-Three Members</p>
<p>Appointed Separately by the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Regarding the establishment of warehousing in Shanghai, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau previously drafted a set of regulations for the Warehousing Fund Raising Committee and submitted it to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgation. Now, the Municipal Government believes that the rice harvest this year has been abundant everywhere, and rice prices are bound to fall. Establishing warehouses at this time would be easy. Therefore, in accordance with Article 3 of the regulations for the Warehousing Fund Raising Committee (this committee shall have thirty-three members, appointed separately by the mayor from among the various subordinate agencies and local merchants), the following have been appointed: Sun Baorong, Counselor; Zhu Hao, Section Chief; Pan Yizhan, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau; Tang Naikang, Acting Director of the Finance Bureau; Gu Yu Guang, Manager of the Municipal Bank; Chen Ya Fu, Municipal Committee Member of the Pusong District; Chen Tian Xi, Municipal Committee Member of the Yangsi District; Pan Hongding, Municipal Committee Member of the Gaohang District; Tang Chengzong, Municipal Committee Member of the Wusong District; Zhu Zongluo, Municipal Committee Member of the Yinhang District; Yan Enzuo, Municipal Committee Member of the Jiangwan District; Hong Lanxiang, Municipal Committee Member of the Zhenru District; as well as Yu Qiaqing, Wang Yiting, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Qin Runqing, Hu Mengjia, Bei Songsun, Xu Jilun, Gu Xinyi, Yuan Ludeng, Yao Zirang, Liu Hongsheng, Shen Lianfang, Yao Mulian, Wang Yansong, Ye Huijun, Lin Kanghou, Zhu Zixiang, Lu Wenshao, Lao Jingxiu, and Zhu Wenqi, totaling thirty-three people. The list of members has been copied and sent to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, instructing them to convene the first meeting immediately and carefully discuss and proceed with the matter.</p>

<h3>Second Day of the Provincial Committee's Discussion with County Training Directors</h3>
<p>County-Level Agency Discussion Meeting Held in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Today to Guide the Reorganization of the Chamber of Commerce in Minhang</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Committee, in order to guide the reorganization of existing mass organizations in various counties, has dispatched Training Director Zhang Yuanyang and Instructor Zhang Renjie, together with Chen Tonggang from the Provincial Department of Construction, to guide the Fourth District counties. After arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday, they convened the first discussion with the training directors of the various counties at the Shanghai County Party Headquarters. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the discussion continued. Those present included Provincial Training Director Zhang Yuanyang, Instructor Zhang Renjie, Chen Tonggang from the Department of Construction, Han Rongling (Shanghai), Zhu Tiexian (Songjiang), Zhang Ming (Fengxian), Huang Xuze (Qingpu), Ge Zuwang (Baoshan), Wang Guanglong (Chuansha), and Huang Yueping (Nanhui). First, Comrade Zhang Renjie reported, stating briefly the significance of this trip, divided into the following points: (1) Urging the counties to step up their work; (2) The Provincial Government's Department of Construction will send representatives to assist the county governments; (3) Explaining and interpreting laws and regulations and guiding practical issues. Next, he mentioned the mission: (1) Each county is a unit; (2) The Chamber of Commerce should focus on small and medium-sized merchants; (3) Trade associations must complete their organization; (4) Labor unions must be legally organized; (5) Student unions must be organized in accordance with organizational principles and completely; (6) Other social, cultural, and charitable organizations should be guided to establish themselves at any time. Next, he discussed the problems of the counties, hoping to receive a written report to be submitted to the province. He then said that he planned to go to the counties of the Fourth District for actual guidance. Finally, he reported on behalf of the Provincial Training Department, briefly summarizing everything. Next, Chen Tonggang from the Department of Construction reported, saying briefly that he had the same mission as Comrade Zhang, but only to supplement that people's organizations must be organized in accordance with laws and regulations. He was not clear about the Merchants and People's Association and asked the comrades to report so that he could forward it to the director. Next, Provincial Training Director Zhang Yuanjie reported, briefly saying that his department had assigned instructors to go to the counties to step up the work of organizing people's organizations in order to understand the actual situation in the counties. Therefore, he had not participated. He also briefly described the significance: (1) Organizing people's organizations to consolidate the foundation of the Party and government; (2) The people themselves are not urgently needed to be organized at present, but in order for the Party to hand over power to the people, they must be organized and trained; (3) There are too many problems within the Party, and it is generally believed that it is empty and there is no proper party work to be done, so more work should be done to reduce disputes. As for the work, it should be to awaken the people, but empty words are still useless, so it is necessary to go deep among the people. Therefore, the organization of people's organizations is actually opening a path for the Party's cause. As for the purpose of the organization, attention should be paid to the progress of the business. The government supervises, and the Party guides. However, the central plan was promulgated long ago, but so far the results of the work are very few. In order to step up the work, people are sent to do it on the ground. This is the significance of the province sending personnel. At the same time, the government is also paying close attention, so it also sends personnel at the same time, and it can also make the county governments pay attention. As for the purpose, at the very least, the central legislators should not be disappointed. Apply the various rules and regulations to give the people a considerable understanding and interest, and the counties can emulate this. The county training departments should also step up this work. There is great hope. Finally, he reported that the recent work of the training department was quite detailed. (The long speech is not recorded.) Finally, the training directors of the various counties reported on the difficulties in organizing people's organizations. The provincial training director and instructors explained separately, and then the meeting was adjourned. At 2:00 PM, a discussion meeting was convened again with the county-level agencies. Those present were Zhang Renjie (provincial instructor), Chen Tonggang (provincial construction office), Yan Shenyu (county government), Ye Dezhen, Shi She (county education bureau), Wu Wenhua (construction bureau), Ding Guangzhi, Shen Jing'er (public security bureau), Cai Zhongji, Tao Yishan, Wang Libin, Jiang Yanchiu, and Han Rongling (county party headquarters). First, Zhang Renjie reported: (1) The significance of the Party and government jointly organizing people's organizations on the ground; (2) Shanghai will take Minhang as the central area. Regarding people's organizations, the organization should start from there first, and then consider the method of promotion; (3) The funding problem of the Shanghai Farmers' Association; (4) The subsidy problem for reorganizing people's organizations. He hoped that the county government would publicize the laws and regulations on people's organizations as much as possible and post more notices in various places to make the people aware of their importance. Next, the representative of the county government reported, stating briefly that the county had very few public properties, and they had all been designated for use, leaving nothing to spend, so other matters that should be handled could not be carried out due to funding problems. However, the county government had an unshirkable responsibility for the funding problem and would do its best to raise funds, but this would have to wait until the county magistrate returned to Shanghai to make a decision on each case. Finally, two issues were decided: (1) The Farmers' Association should be restored according to the provincial order, and the county government should be responsible for planning the funding for the association according to the provincial standard; (2) The subsidy for guiding the reorganization of people's organizations should be disbursed according to the standard for second-class counties, and the county government should try its best to raise funds. Then it was decided that today (the 23rd), representatives from the county party headquarters and the county government would go to Minhang with the provincial instructors to guide the organization of people's organizations. The meeting was adjourned when the clock struck five.</p>
<h3>Proposal from the National Products Industry to the Industrial and Commercial Conference</h3>
<p>Wang Jie and An, standing committee members of the China National Products Maintenance Association, were appointed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce as members of the Industrial and Commercial Conference and are scheduled to go to Beijing on the 31st of this month to participate in the deliberations. The association has already solicited opinions from all industrial and commercial enterprises in Shanghai and appointed committees, including Wang Xingyi, Xu Zouyun, and Xu Chunrong, to conduct a detailed review and classify them. A total of fourteen proposals were made: (1) Regarding the implementation of clothing regulations to relieve the real economy and protect national products; (2) Regarding the abolition of exorbitant taxes and levies to save national products from danger; (3) Regarding relief for unemployed citizens; (4) Regarding strict prohibition of incitement to ensure industrial and commercial stability to benefit workers; (5) Regarding the prompt eradication of banditry to prevent hindrance to the transportation of national products; (6) Regarding the opening of overseas shipping to facilitate transportation; (7) Regarding the adjustment of the burden of commodity taxes to benefit the people's livelihood and maintain national products; (8) Regarding the levying of manufacturing taxes on foreign factories in China and business tax on the sale of foreign goods in the interior, to indirectly prohibit imports and exempt national products from business tax; (9) Regarding the reduction or exemption of export duties on national products and the increase of import duties on foreign goods to maintain national products; (10) Regarding the request to issue industrial bonds of 100 million yuan to establish a basic fund for national product factories; (11) Regarding the promotion of bill of lading financing to facilitate the turnover of industrial and commercial finance; (12) Regarding the request to order the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to instruct foreign merchants to clear accounts in accordance with regulations and not to arbitrarily delay payments; (13) Regarding the request to exempt heavy taxes on porcelain and dredge transportation rivers; (14) Regarding the standardization of sizes. The association's secretariat has already drafted and submitted the proposals to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for consideration at the conference.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machinery-Made National Products Factories Joint Association believes that this Industrial and Commercial Conference is of great importance to national product factories. Therefore, based on the opinions expressed by the factories of the association's members, the association is of the opinion that to promote the development of industry and commerce, all machine-made foreign-style commodity taxes and likin should be exempted first. The association, therefore, proposes that the machine-made foreign-style commodities should be exempted from all taxes and likin and that the raw material taxes should be refunded to maintain the national products industry. The proposal is jointly introduced by Xu Yongzuo, Pan Xulun, Jiang Wenyu, Huang Puqi, Zhang Zilian, and Zheng Shouzhi, members of the Industrial and Commercial Conference. The original text states: "The purpose of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government in convening this Industrial and Commercial Conference is to discuss the removal of difficulties for industry and commerce, and promote the development of industry and commerce, so as to establish factories throughout the interior, and promote the improvement of industrial and commercial undertakings. The intention is good, and the whole country admires it. This association, as a large group of machine-made national product factories, hereby submits its daily experiences and difficulties, and believes that the decline of domestic industry and the stagnation of goods are due to the heavy burden of taxes and levies. The repeated imposition of taxes at every level is particularly painful for the circulation of goods in various parts of the country."</p>
<p>"The heavy taxation by customs and the repeated levies by likin offices cause merchants and travelers to hesitate, and goods to be stagnated. The number of factories in the interior are as few as the stars in the morning sky, and not only cannot they be expanded, but those already established are also closing down day by day. Taking cotton textiles as an example, from the import of raw materials to the production of cloth and its transportation to various places, there is a tax on foreign raw materials, a tax on the manufactured cotton yarn, a tax on the woven cloth, a tax on the local factory output, a tax from place A to place B, and a tax from place B to place C. In addition, there are taxes on machinery, taxes on dyes, taxes on fuel, taxes on decorations, and even taxes on auxiliary parts. This kind of complicated and chaotic tax system is not found in any other country in the world. Can Chinese goods compete with foreign goods? Failure is inevitable. Therefore, under this situation, Hua cotton and Hua yarn, woven into national cloth, bear different tax burdens because of the different cotton-producing regions. In some cases, the tax on Hua cotton is even heavier, and foreign cotton is more advantageous. As a result, Hua cotton, which is of better quality, is replaced by foreign cotton to reduce the cost of goods, causing agricultural products to accumulate and farmers to suffer. Is this not the fault of heavy taxes? The tax on foreign cotton and foreign yarn woven into national cloth is lighter, and the imported foreign cloth has no important surcharges in its own country. China only pays a customs duty of 5% ad valorem, plus a 2.5% surtax, which is the least advantageous. If the tax is calculated on a per unit basis, the assessed value is less than one-third. The comparison of Chinese and foreign tax rates is so disparate that it is already difficult for Chinese industry and commerce to compete with foreign countries. Moreover, foreign industries have more machines and fewer workers, resulting in mass production and achieving twice the result with half the effort everywhere. For example, the Toyota Yarn Factory in Japan has recently installed new-style machinery that allows one person to manage forty-five machines. Compared with China, where one person only manages two machines, the foreign labor cost, whether it is two or four times that of China, is vastly different. In terms of technology, under the lack of both talent and capital, the level of Chinese technology is undeniably immature and crude. The labor cost is not as low as others, and the technology is not as sophisticated as others. The government not only does not show sympathy but also wants to exploit it, imposing taxes at every pass and levies at every check point. To seek the development of industry and commerce is no different from heading south by driving the chariot north, going in the opposite direction. The decline of Chinese industry and commerce to this day, although affected by wars and banditry, is mainly due to the heavy burden of taxes and levies. Now that the wars are over and everything is starting anew, the National Industrial and Commercial Conference is convened at this time. The pain and difficulties of industry and commerce cannot be relieved without starting with taxes and levies. First, all taxes and likin should be abolished. All machine-made foreign-style goods, no matter where, should be exempted from taxation. The imported raw materials have already been taxed once, and the products are taxed again. One item is taxed multiple times, and the cost is more expensive than imported finished products. In this case, even if those who are enthusiastic about national products exhaust their efforts and resist foreign goods, what is the use? Therefore, the refund of raw material taxes will not only save domestic production and resist imports but also reduce costs and facilitate the sale of national products. After the exemption of all taxes and likin, any product, not limited to one place or one factory, can be manufactured anywhere and circulated at any time. In terms of technology, one can specialize in one aspect and achieve the benefits of division of labor and cooperation. For example, in Japan, the hygiene shirt factories are divided into different factories for spinning, weaving, dyeing, and finishing. Each factory specializes in manufacturing, and those who do not need to sell have separate sales organizations. The low cost and sophisticated technology are renowned throughout the country. The products are not only circulated in the country but also supplied to foreign markets. Why can't China imitate this? Furthermore, recently, the government, mindful of the depression of various industries, has heard of relief measures from time to time, such as cigarettes, matches, silk, and soap. With the recent silk industry, it has been nurtured and protected with all its might. However, instead of passively rescuing after the fact, it is better to actively support it beforehand. The method of exempting all taxes and likin and refunding raw material taxes is the only way to strengthen national power, relieve people's livelihood, and develop industry and commerce. The only hope for saving the dying vitality of the national industry and commerce is this. In addition to providing a separate explanation of the comparison of various tax systems, the outline of the proposal is listed as follows. Please include it in the agenda of commercial tax matters and quickly submit it for decision."</p>

<h3>All Matters Related to Public Training of Citizens Are Handled by the Citizen Training Association</h3>
<p>The Directors of Public Training in All Districts Are All Dismissed</p>
<p>The Municipal Executive Committee Notifies All Districts to Comply</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Executive Committee issued Instruction No. 186 yesterday, instructing the executive committees of all district party departments to immediately dismiss the Directors of Public Training. All matters related to public training in all districts shall be directly handled by the Citizen Training Association to unify authority and comply with the law. The instruction states: "For the sake of implementation, the position of the Director of Public Training in the party committees of various districts of this city is not only confusing but also has no legal basis. The 57th Standing Committee meeting of this Committee has resolved to abolish it. The executive committees of the relevant districts are hereby ordered to immediately comply with the abolition and conclude all files of the Public Training Committee. The various seals, together with the report books, should still be reported to the Public Training Association of this Committee. Hereafter, all matters within the scope of public training in the respective districts will be directly managed by the Public Training Association of this Committee."</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Opposes Increased Water Prices—Correspondence</h3>
<p>Zhu Yicai's Reply to the Taxpayers' Association: "Respectfully acknowledging receipt of your letter of the 18th, I have fully understood its contents. Regarding the water fee issue of Deyuan Lane, I have previously agreed on terms with the tenants. Therefore, there was an established practice of collecting 1% along with the rent. The notice issued by my agent is to add 1.5%, which is based on the previous practice. However, the added amount will be temporarily kept separate. Before the Shanghai Real Estate Association issues a notice recognizing the increase, I will not lightly pay it to the water company. The reason for collecting the full amount from the tenants at this time is that I fear that when the matter is resolved in the future, it will be a long time since the start of the increase, and there are many tenants, so it will be difficult to collect the full amount due to possible relocation or other reasons. As Chinese citizens, how can I be willing to send the tenants' money to foreigners for no reason? I only hope that your Association can argue forcefully and achieve the cancellation of the water company's price increase. Then, the added 1.5% will be refunded to the tenants in full, and the tenants will not suffer any losses. Please convey my regards to the tenants of Deyuan Lane and hope that you will not publish this in the newspapers." Zhu Yicai, Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association, 22nd of October, 1920.</p>
<p>The Taxpayers' Association to Zhu Yicai: "Respectfully acknowledging receipt of your kind reply today, I am deeply impressed by your explanation regarding the collection of water fees with the rent of Deyuan Lane as a kind of preparation. However, the amount of 1% is only mentioned in the notice as 2.5% for collecting the water price, and it is not clearly stated separately, which is misleading. Although the use of increased water prices is only related to your good offices, there is no need for our association to worry about it on your behalf. However, it is an ancient teaching to be kind to others. It seems that you should be asked to correct it. As for publishing it in the newspapers, the original intention was to let the public be aware of it. As for your upright actions, in your modesty, you do not seek fame, but the public is willing to hear it and regard it as an example. I am writing to you accordingly, hoping you will understand."</p>
<h3>The Death of the Esteemed Mother, Madam Zhang</h3>
<p>The Taxpayers' Association Sent a Telegram of Condolence Yesterday</p>
<p>Madam Zhang, the mother of Yan Esheng, the Secretary of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and Yan Shenyu, the Magistrate of Shanghai County, passed away in her hometown of Haining at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday after a relapse of an old illness.

<h3>Silk Factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Have Decided to Issue Bonds</h3>
<p>Nine Representatives Appointed to Petition in Beijing</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM yesterday, the Silk Industry Relief Special Committee held its third general meeting at the Silk Industry Association on North Xizang Road. Fifteen representatives from Shanghai, including Wang Xiaolai, Huang Jinfan, Zhang Yunsheng, Wu Shenbo, Zhu Jing'an, Huang Jinqen, and Shen Huachen; representatives from Wuxi, including Cheng Bingruo, Qian Fenghao, Xue Shouxuan, Yang Yuchu, and Zhang Zizhen; and representatives from Zhejiang, including Zhu Mouqian, Jiang Laixian, and Chu Huiseng, attended the meeting. Shen Huachen was elected chairman. After the ceremony, the chairman delivered an opening speech, mainly about requesting the issuance of bonds, hoping that the representatives would report on the past and discuss the progress. Next, the representatives from each district reported on the situation of the previous resolutions being returned to the meeting of the same industry. Zhejiang representative Jiang Laixian had some questions about the repayment of bonds. After discussion, it was decided to proceed with the original resolution. Wuxi representative Qian Fenghao raised the issue of interest payment and repayment of principal for the bonds. After public discussion, it was decided that the principal would be repaid in installments from the date of issuance of the bonds, and the interest would decrease with the principal. Subsequently, Zhu Mouqian, Shen Huachen, Qian Fenghao, Huang Jinqen, Zhu Jing'an, were appointed as members of the review committee. Wang Xiaolai, Huang Jinqen, Qian Fenghao, Zhu Mouqian, Shen Huachen, Zhu Jing'an, Zhuang Laixian, Huang Jinfan, and Cheng Bingruo were appointed as nine committee members to petition in Beijing, petitioning Chairman Chiang, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to approve the issuance of bonds of 10 million yuan, secured by a levy of 20 taels per 100 catties of silk, to be repaid in 65 months. They were scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the night train on the 31st of this month. Travel expenses were temporarily advanced by each district with 500 yuan. The meeting adjourned at 8:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Silk Factories Request Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>The Junyi Company Takes the Lead in Accepting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Factories Association believes that most of the silk factories in this city are rented, and there are few who build their own factory buildings. This year, the silk market has been sluggish, and silk sales in Europe and America have plummeted. All the silk factories in the city have suffered losses and are unable to support themselves. The number of factories that have stopped production is increasing daily. In order to reduce the burden, the factories had previously held a temporary meeting and proposed to send a letter to the landlords requesting a temporary reduction in rent to help them maintain their operations. The letter stated, in brief, that the factory rents of each silk factory are all based on contracts. Contracts are related to the law, and the law is inseparable from human sentiment. Therefore, customs can change the law, and the situation can change customs. Landlords and manufacturers are interdependent. At this time of silk industry devastation, the landlords must also be deeply concerned and hope to have remedies. Therefore, after deliberation by the same industry, from September 1st until the silk market has not recovered, all those who can barely start production will temporarily pay 80% of the original rent, and those who stop working will pay 50%. A few days ago, the Tongyi Silk Factory first received a reply from the landlord, Junyi Company, which stated: "We have received your letter, which details the difficulties of your factory's operations, which is indeed the actual situation. Our company sincerely accepts your request in the true spirit of mutual assistance. The period is from September to May of the 20th year. The eight percent for starting production and the five percent for stopping are based on the standard of starting or not. It is a matter of mutual assistance, and we sincerely reply." Seeing that this company is the first to agree to reduce the factory rent, not wanting to be behind others, and showing enthusiasm for mutual assistance, it can be a model for the whole city.</p>
<h3>The Bureau of Social Affairs Will Show a Film on the Problem of People's Food</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs submitted a report to the Municipal Government last October to produce a film on the problem of people's food in this city. After a year, it has been completed. It is now scheduled to be shown publicly at the Gonghe Theater at 10:00 AM on the 26th of this month.</p>
<h3>The Commercial Workers' Union Issues a Declaration on the Xin Case</h3>
<p>The Commercial Workers' Union issued a declaration on the Xin Dingchang case, in which French sailors drowned Xin Dingchang, stating that the imperialists have long held unequal treaties in China as a protective shield, disregarding the lives of Chinese people and our national laws. As a result, countless inhumane tragedies have occurred. The blood of Zhang Xueliang has not yet dried, the shame of Song Mingsheng has not yet been cleared, and the tragedy of Xin Dingchang has come again. Looking back on the past, our hearts are filled with anger. As citizens under the banner of the revolution in a new China, we hope that our wise government will avenge our grievances to restore national rights and wash away our shame to revitalize the nation. Unexpectedly, national grievances have not been avenged, but sovereignty has been lost; national shame has not been washed away, but our compatriots have died. This time, Xin Dingchang was asking for money for crossing the river, and French sailors dared to rely on their strength to beat him, knocking Xin Dingchang, who was unarmed and unable to resist, into the river, causing him to perish with the waves. After the incident, the murderers left swaggeringly. Although the water police station investigated several times, they did not allow an on-site interrogation of the murderers due to the influence of the French navy. It is obvious that the French naval authorities intentionally shielded the murderers and fostered cruelty. Giving money for crossing the river is the price for labor. The French sailors refused to give it barbarically, revealing their ugly and illegal face, and instead brutally beat Xin Dingchang, knocking him into the river and leaving without looking back. The contempt of French imperialism for the lives of Chinese people has reached its extreme. For the sake of safeguarding national rights and the nation, we hereby lead all members of our union and swear to be the diplomatic backing, until we achieve the punishment of the murderers, compensation for the families of the victims, an apology to our government, and a solid guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again. We hereby declare."</p>
<h3>The Public Training Association of Citizens Thoroughly Investigates the Inside Story of the Rickshaw Industry Dispute</h3>
<p>Organizing a Trade Union is Not Permitted for Outsiders</p>
<p>Increasing Rickshaw Rent Will Affect Public Security</p>
<p>丨Remarks by the Standing Committee of the Association丨</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency reports that the dispute among rickshaw pullers in this city due to the increase in rickshaw rent has led to the simultaneous appearance of advertisements from two rickshaw pullers' unions in the newspapers, attacking each other. To understand the truth of the union and the case, the reporter of Guomin News Agency visited Chen Jun, a standing committee member of the Public Training Association of the Municipal Party Committee, yesterday to inquire about the Party Committee's opinion on the case. The following is a record of Mr. Chen's remarks: (Following is Mr. Chen's statement) "There are many rickshaw pullers in this city, and there has never been a group organization. Back in May of this year, 55 people, including Lu Liangbi, jointly presented a request to the Party Committee to organize a rickshaw pullers' union, claiming to lead the rickshaw workers in the city and set up a meeting place at No. 19 Shaoqing Lane, Lafayette Road, French Concession. At that time, after investigation by the Party Committee, it was found that the people who initiated the organization of the union were not purely workers in the industry. Fearing that once the union was approved, there would be opportunities for outsiders to manipulate and use it, the union was not approved. The case was shelved. Until September 12th, He Wushan and eight others initiated the organization of the Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers' Union, set up a meeting place in Xilinsi Temple, Xilin Heng Road, and also presented a request to the Party Committee for approval, claiming to represent the rickshaw workers in the city. At the time, a ruffian extorted a special donation of one corner per week from the trade union in the French Concession. The Party Committee considered that the two unions both claimed to represent the city, so there must be other reasons or even someone who wanted to use the organization of the union to achieve private goals. Therefore, it immediately sent people to investigate the truth and rejected the request. Unexpectedly, only a few days later, on September 16th, Meng Jinchen and 50 others jointly presented a request to the Party Committee to organize the Shanghai Rickshaw Workers' Union, with its communication address at No. 66 Jiuruli, Yongxing Road, Zhabei, also claiming to represent the rickshaw workers in the city. By this time, the Party Committee was fully aware that the people who came to the meeting one after another to request the organization of a trade union and claimed to be representatives of the city were all excuses and not true representatives of the workers in the industry. Moreover, rickshaw workers are generally poorly educated and have always been indifferent to group organizations. But suddenly, there are so many associations requesting organization one after another. It is obvious that outsiders want to rely on the trade union for other purposes. However, at this time of rising prices and increasing cost of living, the rickshaw workers' daily earnings, apart from paying the rickshaw rent, leave them little to live on, making it extremely difficult to live. If the capitalists increase the rickshaw rent again, it will inevitably be too much oppression. Some people even advocated that because the number of trams and cars in this city is gradually increasing and the rickshaw business is greatly reduced, they propose that the authorities reduce the issuance of rickshaw licenses to further reduce the number of vehicles and increase the rickshaw rent. This is also an inappropriate proposal, because most of the rickshaw workers in this city come from various counties in northern Jiangsu. Because there is no work to be done in the interior, they come to Shanghai to pull rickshaws to make a living. If the number of vehicles is reduced and the rent is increased, the number of unemployed people will inevitably increase, which will affect the public security of this city. In short, the Party Committee is committed to relieving the suffering of the masses and guiding them to a bright future. If true rickshaw workers legally request to organize a trade union, the Party Committee will approve and support it and guide it to become a formal legal entity. As for the truth of this dispute, the Party Committee has sent people to thoroughly investigate it. After the investigation is clear, it will be reported to the central government for instructions and handling."</p>
<h3>Commodity Inspection Bureau Invites Industry Leaders to Discuss the New U.S. Tariff Today</h3>
<p>Relieving Imported Chinese Goods</p>
<p>Methods to Increase Tariffs</p>
<p>Among the goods that China exports to the U.S. market, raw silk is the most important, followed by tung oil, wool, cotton, hog casings, fur, tea, lace, soybean oil, and egg products. According to U.S. statistics, these goods were worth a total of US$182.7 million in 1929, accounting for 4.1% of the total value of U.S. imports. Recently, due to the high value of gold and the low value of silver, foreign trade has already suffered intangible losses. The newly enacted U.S. tariff also seeks to increase tariffs on imported Chinese goods, which will have a significant impact on the future of commerce. The Industry and Commerce Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in Shanghai had previously reported the situation to the ministry, requesting that the news of the U.S. newly enacted tariff be corrected. The ministry then ordered that the news should be communicated to all provincial and directly subordinate agencies, which in turn would inform the chambers of commerce. The ministry ordered that since it would take too long for the ministry to forward the case to the chambers of commerce in various regions, raw silk, tung oil, cotton, livestock products, and other commodities, which are commodities that the ministry has designated for inspection, and the commodity inspection bureaus in various regions have considerable research on the export quantity and value of these commodities, the bureaus can directly convene the merchants in the relevant industries in the nearby regions, Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau should also convene the merchants and conduct careful research and discussion, and submit the results to the ministry for review and approval. After receiving the letter from the Industry and Commerce Bureau, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau decided to invite industry leaders in hides, lace, and egg products to a meeting at the bureau at 2:00 PM today (the 23rd) to discuss effective relief measures and to reply to the Industry and Commerce Bureau, requesting them to send representatives to the meeting at that time.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Plans to Repay Bonds Due This Month</h3>
<p>Nine Types of Principal and Interest Redeemed in October</p>
<p>Total Principal and Interest Payable is More Than Six Million Yuan</p>
<p>Among the domestic bonds and treasury bills issued by the Ministry of Finance in the past, nine types of bonds are due to be drawn and repaid and pay interest in October this year. The total principal payable is 4,661,400 yuan, and the interest payable is 1,775,780 yuan. The unredeemed bonds of the above nine types of bonds amount to 6,209,827.199 yuan. Now that the time for drawing and redeeming the principal and interest has arrived, the Ministry of Finance has collected all the funds for paying the principal and interest and remitted them to various banks for distribution. The names of the various bonds and treasury bills that are due to be repaid this month are listed below: (1) Reissued 25; (2) Tianjin Customs 25; (3) Cigarette Treasury Bills; (4) Reissued Cigarette; (5) Customs Treasury Bills; (6) Demobilization Treasury Bills; (7) Third Batch of Cigarettes; (8) Customs Short-Term; (9) Haihe Public Bonds. Due to the situation, the above ninth type of Haihe Public Bonds has not yet been fully raised, so the drawing and repayment of the principal due this time will be temporarily deferred. The interest payable is 182,400 yuan, which has been announced by the Ministry of Finance as usual.</p>
<h3>The Rickshaw Pullers' Unrest is Expected to Calm Down</h3>
<p>The rickshaw pullers in this city have recently been distributing leaflets and trying to resist due to the issue of rent increase. Now, with the mediation of a third party, the rickshaw owners have expressed their willingness to compromise. It is because the rickshaw owners have been affected by the high value of gold and the improvement of living standards. In September, they all decided to increase the rickshaw rent by one corner to maintain their business. However, due to the opposition from the rickshaw pullers and the public criticism, representatives of the rickshaw pullers came forward to negotiate and request a reduction. The rickshaw owners also knew the difficult situation and voluntarily agreed to reduce the rent by five cents. The rickshaw pullers' representatives also considered it satisfactory. From then on, the unrest that had been brewing is expected to be resolved.</p>
<h3>Chinese Medical Community Selects Date for Public Banquet Honoring League of Nations Committee Member</h3>
<p>Mr. Fairburn, a committee member recently dispatched by the League of Nations to China to investigate Chinese medicine and health conditions, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, accompanied by Director Yan Zhizhong of the Ministry of Health, and is preparing to begin his investigation. Mr. Zhang Meian, the chief writer of the "Chinese Pharmacy Journal" in this city, believes that Mr. Fairburn's visit to China for investigation is of great importance to the country's medical field and should be given preferential treatment and contributions. This will allow Mr. Fairburn to fully understand the advantages of Chinese medicine and enhance its position internationally. Therefore, in addition to the medical community in this city, which has appointed Mr. Xie Liheng as the general host by the Chinese Medical Association and other medical groups, Mr. Zhang has contacted various pharmaceutical groups, such as the National Pharmaceutical Industry Association and the Pharmaceutical Trade Association. It has been decided to unite the medical and pharmaceutical communities of this city to select a date for a public banquet to welcome Mr. Fairburn and exchange views on various aspects of Chinese and Western medicine. It is reported that the invitation has been sent to Mr. Fairburn, and Director Yan of the Ministry of Health, Director Hu of the Health Bureau, Section Chief Zhao, and Director Xu of the Education Bureau have also been invited to attend. The banquet will be held at the Xin Xin Restaurant, but the date must be determined by Mr. Fairburn. It is expected that when Chinese and Western medical scholars gather together, with toasts and lively conversation, it will be a grand occasion.</p>

<p>Yang Chenqing, also known as Yang Liwen, a female employee of Meidi Bookstore on Fuzhou Road and a native of Wuxi, is in her early twenties, has a pretty face, and has received secondary education. She lives with her mother at No. 4 Peidel Lane, Caojia Bridge, Ximen. Miss Yang recently retained lawyer Lu Qi to file a lawsuit with the Special District Court, criminally accusing her fiancé Lu Shijun (age 22), a native of the same hometown and an editor at Beixin Bookstore.</p>
<h3>Luring a Minor Woman</h3>
<p>Fraudulently Marrying, Maliciously Abandoning, and Also Accusing His Father, Lu Mianru, Who Was the Presiding Officiant at the Time, and Chen Weiruo, Who Was the Matchmaker, So They Were Also Sued. The Lawsuit Stated Briefly That, "The Plaintiff Lost Her Father in Childhood and Only Has a Mother. Therefore, Before the Age of Twenty, She Worked as a Female Employee at Meidi Bookstore on Simalu, Relying on Each Other and Living Frugally, with a Little Savings. Unexpectedly, the First Defendant, Lu Shijun, Approached Because of the Similar Profession, So She Was Lured and Fooled. In the Spring of Last Year, She Was Lured by the Defendant to Rihui Lane, Near the University of Law and Politics Where He Studied.</p>
<h3>Forced Cohabitation</h3>
<p>And Colluded with His Father, Lu Mianru, to Preside Over the Wedding, and His Friend, Chen Weiruo, as a Matchmaker, Pretending to Enter a Marriage Contract, Fraudulently Claiming to Be Married, and Indulging in Lewdness. She Is Now Six Months Pregnant, and Fearing Interference from the School, They Moved Several Times, Thus Depleting All of the Plaintiff's Clothes and Cash. Finally, He Lured Her to the Defendant's Old Home in Wuxi for Many Days. This Showed That All the Plaintiff's Savings Had Been Exhausted. Then, When the Money Was Gone, the Love Waned. He Incited His Mother to Come Forward and Drive the Plaintiff Back to Shanghai. At First, He Still Yielded and Pretended to Stay Together. Then, He Planned to Abandon Her, Claiming to Go to Take an Exam, and Never Returned. Occasionally, There Were Empty Letters of Comfort, But Finally He Betrothed Another Woman Named Zhou, Making</p>
<h3>The Plaintiff Heavily Pregnant</h3>
<p>Unable to Become a Wife, and with No Way to Support Herself, in a Dilemma, She Has a Sense of Being Unable to Survive and Wanting to Die Without a Way. Nothing Is More Cruel Than This. Considering That the Plaintiff Is a Young and Weak Woman with an Unsteady Will, She Has Been Trampled Like This, Although It Can Be Said That She Brought It on Herself, What Can Be Said? However, Reason, Morality, Law, and Ethics Do Not Tolerate This Female Scoundrel. And in a Few Months, This Loveless Child Will Be Born Again. Even If It Is Not for the Sake of the Plaintiff's Life and Personality, It Is Also</p>
<h3>To Act as a Warning Against Female Rights Violators</h3>
<p>Therefore, This Lawsuit Is Filed. Please Ask Your Court to Sentence the Defendant Lu Shijun for Violations of Articles 244, 257, and 310 of the Criminal Law. The Second and Third Defendants, Lu Mianru and Chen Weiruo, Will Each Be Punished for Crimes Under Article 258 of the Same Law, and Order Lu Shijun to Pay the Plaintiff Lifetime Alimony and Damages of 15,000 Yuan." The Court, Based on the Lawsuit, Approved It and Issued an Order, Ordering the Arrest and Notification of Each Defendant, Who Should Report to the Court for Questioning at the Appointed Time. Yesterday Afternoon, The Time for the Trial of This Case Had Arrived. Judge Feng Shide Presided Over the Questioning in the Fifth Criminal Court. All Three Defendants Were Present for the Hearing. Only Lu Mianru Commissioned a Lawyer to Appear in Court. Then, The Plaintiff's Agent, Lawyer Lu Qi, Stood Up and Described the Case.</p>
<h3>And Submitted the Engagement Agreement</h3>
<p>The Engagement Agreement Stated That "(Lu Shijun and Yang Liwen, Who Are Willing to Enter into a Marriage Contract, Have Agreed That Both Parties Are Willing and Not Forced, and Will Be Married in the Future. Mr. Chen Weiruo Will Act as a Witness. If Either Party Changes Their Mind Midway and Does Not Fulfill the Contract, They Will Voluntarily Be Punished by Law and Will Not Regret It. To Avoid Any Future Disputes, This Agreement Is Made as Proof. Signed by the Parties: Lu Shijun, Yang Liwen. Witness: Chen Weiruo. April 5, 1929.)" And Lu Shijun Wrote a Certificate, Stating Briefly That "(Yang Chenqing, The Woman I Love, Is Poor but Protects Me, We Entered a Good Marriage. After the Zhou Family Returns, We Will Immediately Marry Her. We Have Set a Date Before the Wedding to Serve as Proof. After Returning Home, I Will Never Change My Mind. To Avoid Any Future Disputes, This Is a Certificate. If I Break My Word, I Will Be Punished by Law. It Is Clearly Stated on All Sides and There Are No Objections. Signed by Lu Shijun. Witness: Wu Ziming.)" Then, The Plaintiff Yang Chenqing Testified. Yang Was Wearing a Dark Green Plaid Short Jacket and Was Heavily Pregnant. She Stood in the Witness Box,</p>
<h3>Eloquently Narrating the Experience</h3>
<p>And Said That At That Time, I Was Working as a Female Employee at Meidi Bookstore, and the Defendant Was an Editor at Beixin Bookstore. Because of Our Similar Professions, We Approached Each Other. Lu Then Proposed to Me and Stated That He Had No Wife. Seeing That His Will Was Quite Firm and That He Was Studying at the University of Law and Politics, I Agreed. So We Rented a House in Rihui Lane Near the University of Law and Politics and Lived Together. My Mother Also Learned of This at That Time and Expressed Her Approval. The Defendant Lu Shijun's Father, Mianru, Also Approved and Was Willing to Act as the Presiding Officiant. From Then On, All Daily Expenses Were Paid by Mianru on a Monthly Basis. Until Last Year, When We Returned to Wuxi with Shijun, I Learned That</p>
<h3>He Had Already Engaged to a Woman Named Zhou</h3>
<p>However, He Had Not Officially Married Her. Then We Returned to Shanghai. In April of This Year, Shijun Claimed That There Was a Big Exam at School, So He Left and Never Returned. The Daily Expenses Were Cut Off and He Abandoned Me. At First, There Was Frequent Correspondence, But Then There Was No Trace of Him. I Have Not Seen Him Since. Now I Am Six Months Pregnant and About to Give Birth. The Defendant Thinks That He Has Graduated from University and Is Heartlessly Ignoring Me. I Cannot Marry Another Person, Nor Do I Want to Live with the Defendant. My Family Is Poor. Please Order Him</p>
<h3>The Defendant to Pay Living Expenses</h3>
<p>So That I Can Barely Survive. Otherwise, Please Punish Him According to the Law." Then, Lu Mianru's Agent Lawyer Stood Up and Said That "My Client Is Currently in Wuxi and Will Arrive in Shanghai Around the End of This Month. Therefore, We Request an Adjournment. As for the First Defendant Lu Shijun, He Is Mianru's Son. He Left Without Saying Goodbye in March of This Year and There Is No Trace of Him. The Third Defendant Chen Weiruo Is Not Known to Him. Now the Court Sent Chen's Subpoena to Mianru's Residence. Since There Is No Way to Forward It, We Have Specially Returned the Subpoena. However, My Client Lu Mianru Had Engaged a Woman Named Zhou as Shijun's Wife in His Hometown in 1928. In the Spring of Last Year, Shijun Declared to His Father That He</p>
<h3>Did Not Want to Marry a Woman from the Countryside</h3>
<p>And Wanted to Enter Into an Engagement With the Plaintiff Yang in Shanghai. Therefore, The Father and Son Cut Ties. Therefore, How Shijun and Yang Developed Their Relationship Afterwards Is Unknown. However, Mianru Is An Old-Fashioned Person. He Cannot Cancel the Engagement With the Zhou Woman Who Has Already Been Engaged in the Countryside." Judge Feng Reviewed the Testimony and Then Ordered That the Case Be Adjourned and the Defendant Be Summoned to Appear for Questioning.</p>

<h3>Declaration of the Citizens' United Association</h3>
<p>The Citizens' United Association Issued a Serious Declaration on the Xiao Case, Stating That, "Miss Xiao Xin'an Was Hired by the Peide School on Ambon Island in the Dutch East Indies. On the Way, She Was Repeatedly Forced and Insulted by the Chief Officer and Second Officer of the Chibatj Ship of the Dutch Merchant Java Steamship Company. Their Disregard for Our National Prestige and Dignity Has Reached the Extreme. Anyone with Blood in Their Veins Will Be Furious Upon Hearing This. However, Most of Our People's Psychological Illness Is That They Often Think That It Is None of Their Business and Remain Indifferent. In Addition to the Overseas Chinese United Association and Two or Three Other Groups Sending Letters and Cables in Support, There Are No Concrete Measures Yet. To Plan a Solution, The Association's Responsibility Lies in Not Remaining Silent, Advocating That the Whole Country Should Rise Up and Absolutely Boycott the Java Steamship Company's Business in China, Such as (Loading Cargo) (Taking Ships), Etc., and Appeal to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Negotiate With Them Seriously. Until the Dutch Government Officially Apologizes to Us, the Crew of the Chibatj Are Punished, and Miss Xiao Receives Adequate Compensation, All Matters Related to the Java Steamship Company's Business Scope Are Severed to Show the Boycott and Act as a Backup. The People of the Country Must Know That Miss Xiao's Insult Is a Stain on Our Entire Nation. If This Shame Is Not Avenge, What Dignity Will Remain? Do Not Let Foreigners Laugh at Us for Having No Collective Spirit and No Sense of Justice, And Fall into International Reputation, This Is a Declaration, I Hope You Will Take Notice, Patriots, Come Forth!"</p>
<h3>Yixing Fellow Villagers Association Telegram</h3>
<p>To the Editors of All Newspapers: Our association, in order to assist with the Xiao case, has appealed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We recently sent the following telegram to Minister Wang:</p>
<p>To His Excellency Wang, Minister of Foreign Affairs: Xiao Xin'an, a woman from Yixing, accepted a position as a teacher at the Zhonghua Elementary School on Ambon Island, Dutch East Indies. On August 13th, she departed from Shanghai aboard the "Tjipatti" of the Java-China-Japan Lijn. Tragically, during the voyage, she was subjected to violent assault by the ship's chief officer and second officer, both Dutch nationals. The details have already been reported in various newspapers and need not be elaborated upon. Ms. Xiao traveled thousands of miles alone, crossing vast oceans, to dedicate herself to the education of overseas compatriots. Her character is most admirable. Yet, these two Dutchmen acted audaciously and recklessly, inflicting this humiliation. Human rights are endowed, and national dignity is at stake. All citizens share a deep sense of outrage. Moreover, due to our shared hometown, we find it especially difficult to remain silent. Regarding the matter of Ms. Xiao's humiliation, we earnestly request Your Excellency to lodge a protest with the Dutch Minister to China and engage in serious negotiations until the goal of avenging this egregious wrong is achieved. This would be fortunate for the international community and fortunate for the people of Yixing. Respectfully, the Yixing Fellow Villagers Association.</p>
<h3>Unbearable Tragedy: Mother and Daughter Commit Suicide by Hanging Together</h3>
<p>Liu Yingzhou is a Social Scourge</p>
<p>He Does Not Treat His Wife and Daughter as Human Beings</p>
<p>Liu Remains Unfazed by the Tragedy</p>
<p>The Authorities Should Impose Severe Punishment</p>
<p>At approximately 7:30 PM last night, a tragic incident occurred at No. 6 Maoxing Lane, Fumin Road, in the southern part of the city. A mother and daughter, abandoned and neglected by the husband/father, committed suicide by hanging themselves together. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Liu Yingzhou's Transformation</h3>
<p>Liu Yingzhou, a native of Dongting Mountain, Suzhou, is 36 years old. He works as an accountant at the Meilun Silk and Satin Store, and his demeanor is that of a refined young gentleman. Fourteen years ago, through a matchmaker, he married the eldest daughter of Zhou Xinfu, a teacher from the same hometown. Mrs. Zhou is the same age as Liu. Initially, they lived in harmony, but before a year had passed, Liu's attitude suddenly changed, and poor Mrs. Zhou was virtually abandoned.</p>
<p>Taking a Concubine in Shanghai: Having decided to abandon his wife, Liu, only three years into his marriage, took a concubine, a woman surnamed Yu (30 years old) from Ningbo, in Shanghai. He rented a separate residence at No. 6 Tanzi Lane, East Street, near the Xiaodongmen, and lived there with her, completely forgetting about Mrs. Zhou. However, Mrs. Zhou had already given birth to a daughter named Yun'e, now 11 years old. Mrs. Zhou originally lived in the countryside of Dongting. Although she had heard that her husband had taken a concubine, as a typical rural woman, she could only endure and accept her fate, hoping that her husband might change his mind.</p>
<p>Living Almost Cut Off: Having found new love, Liu treated Mrs. Zhou as an eyesore. He even took further steps to divorce her. Mrs. Zhou endured what she could, but in the second month of the lunar calendar last year, she took her daughter with her to Shanghai and rented a place on Xundao Street near the Dadongmen. However, Liu still discarded her like worn-out shoes and did not visit her for an entire month. As a result, their livelihood was almost cut off. Fortunately, Mrs. Zhou had a younger brother named Zhou Qifeng, who worked at the Xiexing Chongjin Silk and Satin Factory on Baoding Road in Hongkou, and he provided her with regular assistance.</p>
<p>Attempted Suicide Repeatedly: Until September 21st of last year, Mrs. Zhou and her young daughter Yun'e had attempted suicide by swallowing gold jewelry and matches a total of four times over several months. Each time, they were rescued. On September 21st, through Qifeng's mediation, Liu finally agreed to provide Mrs. Zhou with a monthly allowance of 18 yuan, stipulating that Mrs. Zhou must return to Dongting. Mrs. Zhou then took her daughter back to their hometown. However, the mental anguish she suffered was indescribable.</p>
<p>Pawning Clothes and Jewelry: After Mrs. Zhou returned to Suzhou, Liu did not send her a single penny until March of this year. Forced by circumstances, she again took her daughter to Shanghai and rented a place in the front building of No. 6 Maoxing Lane, Fumin Road. Liu not only did not change his previous behavior, showing no pity for Zhou, but also repeatedly came to pressure her to hand over her clothes and jewelry to be pawned. He was determined to place Mrs. Zhou in an impossible situation, forcing her to return to Dongting. As a result, the tragic incident occurred.</p>
<p>Two Bodies Discovered: The day before yesterday, Mrs. Zhou went to her brother Qifeng's home in Hongkou and poured out her grievances, expressing her disillusionment with the world. After her brother repeatedly advised and comforted her, he sent her home. Yesterday afternoon around 7:00 PM, Qifeng, fearing something might happen, went to visit her in the southern part of the city. Upon entering the room, he found it unusually dark. He could only vaguely see two objects hanging from either side of the bed. He called out repeatedly, but received no response. When he touched them, he realized with horror that they were the bodies of his sister and niece.</p>
<p>Liu was Smoking Opium: Qifeng cried out in shock, and neighbors gathered. By the time they were taken down, both were already dead. Qifeng then went out to report to the police station and searched everywhere for Yingzhou without success. He first went to Liu's father, Liu Ziqing, at Wanlong Shenzhuang, Fuchang Lane, Xiaodongmen, but gained no information. After repeated inquiries, he finally found Liu at Fengji Yanzike, Yangxing Street, in the French Concession. Liu was lying on a couch, smoking opium.</p>
<p>Truly Without Conscience: Qifeng lured Liu to the First District Third Precinct. At this time, Liu seemed to have woken up from a dream. After Chief Jin briefly questioned him, and also summoned neighbor Zhang Ayao to the station to testify, Zhou's suicide note was found on the table. The words were extremely sad and unbearable to read. Looking back at Liu Yingzhou, who had abandoned his wife, he appeared unusually carefree, smiling as if immensely pleased with himself. Alas, this man is truly without conscience. After questioning, Chief Jin ordered the local security to be notified and instructed to report to the court today to request an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Why So Many Suicides?</h3>
<p>Hidden Worries for Society's Future</p>
<p>May the Authorities Find a Way to Eliminate This</p>
<p>Shi Jianzhang: A young man in Western attire, speaking with a Sichuan accent, arrived at the Oriental Hotel at the intersection of Xizang Road and Sixth Avenue around 5:00 PM on the 19th of this month. He claimed to be named Shi Jianzhang from Sichuan, about 23 or 24 years old. The tea servant led him to Room 246 on the second floor, western section, to rest. Shi went out alone that night and returned around 2:00 AM the next morning. From the night of the 19th until yesterday morning, this was his regular pattern, and the tea servant did not pay much attention. The night before last, after Shi went to sleep, he seemed quite calm. Until this morning, when the sun was high, he had not gotten up. The tea servant knocked on the door around 1:00 PM, and the response was very faint. He asked if he wanted to continue staying, but Shi was lying on the bed, turned to the inside, and a sound came from his throat that was neither yes nor no, with only air and no voice. The tea servant was afraid that the guest had not woken up yet, so he did not dare to make any further noise and left Room 246. About an hour and a half later, the accounting office ordered the tea servant to go and see if he wanted to change rooms. But after entering the room, there was silence, and the guest was lying on the bed, his limbs stiff and in an unnatural pose. Looking at his face, it was purplish-white, and saliva was flowing from the corners of his mouth, as if he was in great pain. The tea servant rushed to report to the accounting office, who in turn notified the Zhabei Police Station to send an ambulance to the Oriental Hotel. Shi was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. It was determined that he had taken a type of opium-based anesthetic. By then, it was already 3:30 PM. Because he had taken too much poison, all attempts to save him were ineffective, and he died in the hospital around 7:00 PM in the evening. All his last words and belongings were taken away by the police station.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunfu: Zhang Chunfu, a 23-year-old native of Ningbo, was a merchant. Yesterday afternoon around 7:00 PM, he checked into Room 165 of the Asia Hotel on Hankou Road. Zhang was wearing a crepe robe and was completely alone, with no belongings. Because he spoke with a Ningbo accent, it was known that he was from Ningbo, but his face was red and flushed all the way to his ears, as if he had drunk too much. Zhang claimed that he was drunk, but his other words were evasive. After entering the room, he did not call for the tea servant. Around 8:00 PM, a moan was suddenly heard from the room, which sounded very painful. The tea servant broke down the door and saw that Zhang's expression was very different, and his breathing was rapid. The tea servant immediately reported to the accounting office, called the police, and hired a car to send him to Renji Hospital for emergency treatment. After receiving the news, the Zhabei Police Station immediately sent detectives to the Asia Hotel to investigate the truth. In the room, Zhang Chunfu's note to his father, Zhang Yinsheng, with the address of No. 351 Anli, Beishan West Road, was found. Another letter was addressed to his father-in-law, Zhou Changhua, generally stating that he was committing suicide due to difficult living conditions and economic pressure.</p>
<p>Chen Yi: Five days ago, on the morning of the 17th, a man and a woman came to the Daxin Hotel on Fuzhou Road and checked in together. The man was wearing a Western suit and claimed to be named Chen Yi from Hangzhou. He used to serve in the military. The woman was also about the same age, with short hair and Western-style shoes, dressed fashionably. They had been staying indoors for several days, with little contact with the outside world. Until 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the two guests had not gotten up. The female servant went into the room to change the bedding and suddenly discovered that both Chen Yi and the woman had been poisoned and were moaning on the bed. The woman's expression was particularly severe. She reported the information to the accounting office, who notified the Zhabei Police Station to send detectives to investigate. The man and woman were immediately sent to Renji Hospital for emergency treatment, and their lives were in danger. Later, a note was found in the room, addressed to the accounting office of the Daxin Hotel, roughly stating that things were unavoidable and that they had unspeakable difficulties.</p>
<p>Ding Jinsheng: Ding Jinsheng, who lived at No. 166 Baoyu Lane, Dongxin Bridge, in the French Concession, was about 30 years old. He had been unemployed for a long time and suddenly felt economically pressured, so he had a rash idea. At 11:30 AM yesterday, he secretly swallowed opium paste. Before long, the poisoning became uncontrollable. His family discovered it and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he died despite the rescue efforts. The hospital then sent the body to Tongren Fuyuantang to await an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Over Mother and Son's Property</h3>
<p>The French Court Heard the Case Yesterday</p>
<p>The Debate Concluded and Awaits Judgment</p>
<p>Madam Zhou Chen, a widow, retained a lawyer last year to represent her in the French court to sue her rebellious son, Zhou Shu, for squandering family property, requesting that he be declared incompetent to manage his affairs. The court ruled as requested. Afterward, the defendant, Zhou Shu, disagreed with the judgment and presented reasons to request a retrial. The request was granted. After repeated hearings, the court ruled in favor of Zhou Shu. Now, the person against whom the retrial was sought, Zhou Chen, also disagrees with the retrial judgment and has retained lawyers Li Zuyu and Li Xinyang to present new evidence and request a new trial. This was also approved. The court hearing was held yesterday, with Judge Zhu Qisheng presiding over the civil court. The retrial plaintiff's lawyers stated that the retrial request was based on two points. First, regarding the request to restrict capacity, since the retrial court determined that the defendant was not a spendthrift, it ruled that the property at Mintine Lane, etc., should be managed by the defendant. The plaintiff has now discovered that the defendant has sold the property in Jijia Lane and used the proceeds. This point alone proves that the defendant is undoubtedly a spendthrift and can be required to restrict capacity. Second, Zhou Shu is the plaintiff's posthumous son. At the age of fifteen, in 1906 (Guangxu 32), the plaintiff used her private savings to purchase the property at Mintine Lane. At that time, the plaintiff used the name of Zhou Zhongsun and registered it at the law office of Gao Yi. However, Zhou Shu was still young at the time and never went to Gao Yi's office to sign. Now, the plaintiff has borrowed a copy of the Zhou family property division book from the fifth room for inspection, proving that the defendant's grandmother had very little family property when the property was divided. This shows that the property at Mintine Lane was indeed purchased by the plaintiff personally. The defendant's real name is Zhou Shu, also known as Zhou Zhongsheng, not Zhou Zhongsun. There is a letter from his representative lawyer to prove this. It is requested that the retrial be approved. The court replied that the initial judgment should be maintained. The defendant, Zhou Shu, also retained a lawyer to argue that the defendant's real name is Zhou Shu, also known as Zhou Zhongsun. The plaintiff also admitted in the initial statement that Zhou Shu is Zhou Zhongsun. The plaintiff in this case is now requesting a retrial system. This is the beginning of the court's era and should be taken with extra caution. The law must have a certain procedure. The plaintiff's request to restrict capacity is based on the fact that the law only applies to those between the ages of seven and fifteen. As for the Jijia Lane property, it was mortgaged to others due to business fluctuations. How can this be considered wasteful? The second issue is the Mintine Lane property, which was actually purchased by Zhou Shu's grandmother, Madam Ma, with money given to her grandson. Zhou Shu signed it as proof and was not the plaintiff's private savings. Later, due to bad feelings between mother and son, Zhou Chen secretly went to Gao Yi's office to change the name. It is requested that the retrial judgment be executed as before. The plaintiff's lawyer also stated that the defendant sold the Jijia Lane property only after the retrial, which should be restricted. As for the Mintine Lane property, the plaintiff holds the title deed as proof, which clearly shows that the property was purchased solely by Chen. The defendant's lawyer said that it was Zhou Shu's property. Is there any rebuttal evidence presented? In short, the plaintiff is in her twilight years, and her family is alive. If she is wasted by Zhou Shu again, the plaintiff's daughters-in-law and grandchildren will have no one to rely on. He requested a clear investigation. Then, the lawyers of both parties debated for a long time. The court announced that the debate was over and that the decision would be made later.</p>
<h3>New Plan for Reorganized Domestic Goods Market</h3>
<p>Since its reorganization, the domestic goods market run by Zhang Zilian on Nanjing Road has been working hard to improve its internal decorations. Moreover, in the western part of the market, construction is underway to implement its first declaration, the branch system, to bring together domestic goods from all over the country in one place for the convenience of domestic people's purchases. In addition, it has adopted Ren Jinpin's (Construction Plan for Domestic Goods Business) and is starting to organize (China Domestic Goods Business Joint-Stock Limited Partnership), raising 200,000 yuan to expand its operations. It is heard that Chen Yiting, Wang Hanqiang, Cao Zhigong, and industrial leaders Xiang Songmao, Chen Diexian, Huang Hongjun, Zhang Xianda, Cui Fuzhuang, Tang Shaoqi, Pan Dechun, and dozens of others, who have always been enthusiastic about promoting domestic goods, have participated in the initiation. The plan proposed by Ren focuses on gathering the power of consumers to promote the reorganization of commercial organizations, with the help of the development of agriculture and industry. The entire plan is divided into four stages, and the implementation procedure is divided into stages and listed, which is quite precise.</p>
<h3>Daxin Silk and Satin Bureau's Business is Booming</h3>
<p>The Daxin Silk and Satin Bureau on Shilu Road in this city is a large silk and satin store that was born to adapt to the new era. Its internal organization is very different from that of old-fashioned stores. The purchase of goods is based on understanding social psychology, drawing patterns, and ordering weaving from various famous factories. It is also heard that it has special agents stationed in France who specialize in collecting new Parisian costume patterns and sending them back for imitation. Therefore, the bureau's various products are able to promote the new and innovate, using the strengths of domestic silk, absorbing the essence of European and Western material civilization, with unique creativity and novel colors, which are extremely popular with customers. Business has been booming in recent days. It is heard that the bureau's new opening low-price period is about to expire. In order to repay the kindness of all circles, it plans to hold an autumn sale at a set time, which will be announced soon.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Laotaiping Street Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Police Officer Chases and Captures a Thief</p>
<p>Later, Two More People Involved Were Apprehended</p>
<p>Yesterday at around 5:00 AM, when an apprentice from the family of Yu Xiangsheng, a local who lived at No. 131 Laotaiping Street and set up a meat stall in the vegetable market, went out to get water, three robbers suddenly broke in. Each took out a pistol, threatening to silence them. They first drove all the people in the store into the back room, where one robber guarded them with a gun. The other two robbers went upstairs to search and loot. After about half an hour, they each fled with the stolen goods. The shop owner chased after them and called for help. The robbers ran from Laotaiping Street, across Zhonghua Road, into Yaojia Lane, and then to Dong Street, intending to flee north. Ha Zhizhu, a police officer from the First District General Office, joined the pursuit. He chased them to the Liujia Lane area under the jurisdiction of the Second Sub-precinct of the First District. Zhou Fuhai, a police officer from Post 31, and Zhao Shucheng, a police officer from Post 36, also joined the assistance. Near Post 32, police officer Wang Zhenbang had already heard the alarm and prepared with his gun. Seeing that there was police blocking his way, one of the robbers raised his pistol and pulled the trigger repeatedly, but the bullet failed to fire. Wang suspected it was a rusted gun, so he bravely raised the gun handle and struck the robber's leg several times, finally knocking him to the ground. At the same time, the police officers chasing from behind had also arrived and captured him. Wang then picked up the gun discarded by the robber and, upon touching the trigger, it suddenly fired with a loud bang, sending a bullet out. Fortunately, no one was injured. After checking the robber's body, they found 100 yuan in paper money, 10 jiao in small coins, 2 diamond buckles, 203 double-hao coins, 47 single-horn coins, one gold bracelet, one child's bracelet, two inlaid gemstone rings, and two pure gold rings, all of which were stolen goods from the Yu family. At the same time, the owner, Yu Xiangsheng, also arrived and stated that, in addition to all the original stolen goods, a phonograph had been discarded by the robber in a nearby trash can and had been picked up by a police officer from the First District. Questioning the captured robber, he gave his name as Jiang Apin, 21 years old, from Ningbo. He used to work at the Pudong Cigarette Factory and currently lives at the home of Lu Sanbao in Lujiazhai, Pudong. He said that the pistol was given to him by Sanbao and that Sanbao instigated the robbery. The night before last, they first met at Room 112, Changfa Machinery Factory in the French Concession, and then went to rob in the morning. According to his confession, Chief Ma ordered Wang Wencai and Tang Mingtao, along with patrol leaders Ma Jie and Cui Xishun from the First District, and police officers Guo Linfu, Ting Lie, Shi Xunwei, Yi Wenlan, Zhang Jitian, etc., to go directly to the home of Lu Sanbao in Lujiazhai, Pudong, and arrest Sanbao. Four yuan in paper money, fourteen yuan in silver dollars, and three photos were found. His wife, Lu Ge's, also had a gold ring. After Chief Ma questioned him severely, he confessed that Jiang Apin and he knew each other. Jiang had committed a crime before and was sentenced to three weeks. His mistress left him because of this, so Jiang suspected that he was having an affair with his mistress, resulting in a deep grudge. Moreover, Jiang sometimes asked him for loans. As for the robbery, he knew nothing about it. When questioned, Lu Ge's confession was the same as Sanbao's. Chief Ma also sent patrol leaders Wang and Ma to Changfa Inn to investigate Miao Caibao, who was related to the case. He currently lives in the back room of the second floor of No. 3, Baxianfang, Baxianqiao, with his mistress, Ms. Chen. Caibao left home shortly after arriving. A photo was found in the room. After Chief Ma clarified the situation, he handed over all the criminals, stolen goods, and evidence to the First District for interrogation. He also submitted a document to the director for verification.</p>
<h3>Fudan University Yancheng Fellow Villagers' Concern for Their Hometown</h3>
<p>Telegraph to Jiangsu Provincial Government...Requesting Swift Suppression of Bandits</p>
<p>The Yancheng Fellow Villagers Association of Fudan University in Jiangwan, Shanghai, due to the fact that their hometown has suffered from bandits for three months, with the people living in deep water and dire straits, in addition to following the consistent appeals of the Yancheng fellow villagers associations of various universities at sea, yesterday sent a special telegram to Chairman Ye of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and Director Li of the Security Department, making a sincere request to urge them to find a way to completely eliminate the bandits and save the people from their troubles. The words were extremely painful. The original telegram is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>To Chairman Ye of the Zhenjiang Provincial Government and Director Li of the Security Department: Our Yancheng is unfortunate, with disasters coming one after another. After the famine, bandits followed. Houses are in ruins, and the people are suffering. The devastation has spread throughout the entire county, and the number of victims is in the millions. The loyal and righteous land of Song Chancellor Lu Xiufu has been turned into a thistle-filled den of jackals and owls. Those who have personally experienced these tragic situations are heartbroken, and even those who see it with their own eyes cannot help but shed tears. The Shanghai newspapers have no reporters to disclose the actual situation of the suffering in Yancheng, and the troops stationed in the area are too weak to resist the stubborn bandits. Moreover, reports to the superiors say that Ma Ni has fled east or that the area has been cleared. In fact, bandits are still everywhere in the countryside. The people of Yancheng are weeping silently and living in deep water, unable to escape their plight for even a day. Recently, Shagou Town was looted and burned, destroying more than 100 houses and shooting more than 20 townspeople. 136 men and women were abducted. Zhao Yusheng, a well-known and upright gentleman, was kidnapped by bandits and killed by stray bullets. The heartbreaking scene is horrifying, and those who hear it change color. Alas, what crime have the people of Yancheng committed? Our association members are concerned about their hometown and feel the pain deeply. We urgently express our words, our hearts are broken. We humbly request that the officials of our provincial government have compassion and do their best to thoroughly suppress the bandits and address both the symptoms and the root causes, so as to completely eliminate them and save the people from their troubles. This would be fortunate for the people of Yancheng and fortunate for the country. Respectfully, the Yancheng Fellow Villagers Association of Fudan University.</p>
<h3>Illegal Imprisonment of Wife Case Awaits Sentencing</h3>
<p>Li Tan Found to Have No Illness</p>
<p>Li Kebin, a Guangxi native residing at No. 826, Pingliang Road, was discovered by Yangshupu Police Station No. 2160, Section Head Xiang Jianchun, to have illegally imprisoned his wife, Ms. Tan, in the pavilion building between the 9th and 13th of this month, locking the door and depriving her of food. He reported this to the police station, who, together with Chinese and Western detectives, went to rescue Ms. Tan, sent her to the hospital for treatment, and took Li Kebin to the Special District Court. According to Li, Ms. Tan's mental illness had recurred recently, and she wanted to beat people from time to time, so the runaway nanny locked her in the room, denying the allegations of food deprivation. He was ordered to be remanded in custody, and Ms. Tan was sent to the hospital for examination. The details have been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday, Judge Ge Zhitan continued the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. Attorney Zhang Tianyin of the police station stated the case and stated that Li Zhou, the defendant's concubine, was at home during the adjournment and had asked the defendant's nephew, Li Shiyan, to write a letter to a Mr. Lin, asking him to come to court to testify that Li Tan had a mental illness. The letter was discovered by the Chinese and Western detectives who went to investigate, so Ms. Zhou was arrested and detained in the women's prison, and now included in the defendant's position. However, Ms. Tan was also sent to the hospital by the police station and was found by the doctor to have no illness, and the words she said in the hospital were also coherent. The letter and inspection form were presented to the court for inspection. Li Tan spoke in Guangxi dialect, and a woman from the same province translated. At first, she refused to speak, and frequently looked at the two defendants, as if she was afraid of them. Judge Ge understood the situation and ordered the police to take the two defendants out of the courtroom and keep them separate. According to Li Tan, she came to Shanghai with her husband, Li Kebin, from their hometown. Her husband married Li Zhou as a concubine three years ago. Recently, she and the concubine, Zhou, had been in disharmony. She had been locked in the pavilion building for about three days and did not know who had ordered it, but she had been given food. She also stated that she had a daughter in Guangxi, and her other statements were not very clear. According to Li Shiyan, the defendant, Li Kebin, is his uncle. He came to Shanghai with him last year and is currently studying at a school. He lives in the school and only goes home on Sundays. He did not know anything about his aunt, Li Tan, being imprisoned. The letter presented in the case was written by Li Zhou. Li Tan used to scold people, but he did not know anything else. Judge Ge ordered the police to bring the two defendants before the court. Under questioning, they firmly denied the allegations of Li Tan being deprived of food. Li Kebin firmly stated that Tan had been locked in the room because she was sick and that he had ordered it, and that the concubine, Zhou, had nothing to do with it. He begged for leniency. Judge Ge verified the statements, appointed a lawyer to defend the two defendants, and then ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody and scheduled to be sentenced at a later date.</p>
<h3>Yang Heshang's Fate Uncertain</h3>
<p>Elder Brother-in-law Pursues Child Support Payments</p>
<p>Yang Panicked and Helpless, Leaves a Note and Flees</p>
<p>Yang Heshang, a resident of Pudong, is thirty-eight years old and lives at No. 192 Dongyangjiazhai in Pudong. He currently works as a clerk at the Yonghe Customs Brokerage near the Tianhougong Bridge, earning a meager income. Yang lost both parents at a young age and has one younger brother. He was raised by his grandmother since childhood. At the age of seventeen, he married a woman surnamed Zhu from a nearby village through a matchmaker. After three years, she gave birth to a son. However, she fell ill after childbirth and soon passed away, leaving behind a son named Zhifu. At the urging of his mother-in-law, the child was entrusted to Yang's elder brother-in-law, Kang Jinbao, to raise. After losing his wife, Yang's appetite waned, and he became despondent. His mother-in-law, taking pity on him, arranged for him to marry a woman surnamed Yu. They lived together for three years without having any children, and then Yu also fell ill and passed away. His mother-in-law's love for her son-in-law did not diminish, and two years later, she arranged for Yang to marry a woman surnamed Fan, who bore him a daughter, now ten years old. Yang's son, Zhifu, was raised by the Kang family and is now nineteen years old, working at the Fuhe Customs Brokerage on Second Avenue. Kang has already arranged a marriage for him, but Zhifu is in love with another woman, and their affection is deep. Both parties desire to marry. When Kang learned of this, he was furious and forced Yang to sign an agreement to take his son back, severing the foster relationship, and demanding repayment of the past child support expenses. Yang was shocked and panicked upon hearing this. The thought of fleeing arose spontaneously. On the 26th day of last month, at seven o'clock in the morning, after breakfast, he left without saying where he was going, went straight to his sister's house, took out a key and a letter from his sleeve, handed them to his sister to keep, bid a final farewell, gave some instructions, and left Shanghai with tears in his eyes. His sister was unable to stop him and sent the key and letter to his wife. After reading the contents, she knew that there was no way to bring him back. She could not determine whether Yang would commit suicide after leaving or if he was still alive. As he has not returned for several days, she fears the worst. Yesterday, his wife, Fan, sought assistance from various agencies to find him. Although Yang's letter is not well-written, it is extremely tragic. It is transcribed below: "Yang Heshang, my life is truly bitter. My mother died at three, my father at seven. My grandmother raised me. Later, at seventeen, I married. My wife and I worked to make a living. Within three years, a son was born. His mother became ill and died in two days. Later, my mother-in-law, surnamed Zhu, advised Kang Jinbao to take Zhifu. Yang Heshang is now unsettled and wanders outside. Later, I married a woman surnamed Yu. We both worked to make a living, but I had no money to support my son. Unexpectedly, after two or three years, Yu also passed away. Because of my bad luck, I wandered outside. After wandering for a year or two, my mother-in-law, surnamed Zhu, had a good heart and, seeing her poor son-in-law wandering outside, arranged for me to marry a woman surnamed Fan. After we married, Zhifu was betrothed without notifying Yang Heshang. You intentionally didn't return my son, and you didn't inform me about the important matter of betrothal. My son is indulging in pleasure outside and not doing proper work. I didn't take him back in the past two or three years because you wouldn't let me without money. This matter is lost. Kang Jinbao and my son intentionally ruined things. Therefore, starting from July 30th this year, Kang Jinbao forced me, Yang Heshang, to sign an agreement. I, Yang Heshang, knew that my son was wandering outside, so I refused to sign the agreement. He forced me to sign it on August 21st. After signing, Yang Heshang felt suffocated and unhappy. In case of any untoward event, please discuss it, Fan Liugen, Yang Ruihua." (Note: Fan is Yang's maternal uncle, Yang Ruihua is Yang's older brother.)</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Issues Compensation to the Tianchan Stage</h3>
<p>The Tianchan Stage on Second Avenue was previously notified by the Municipal Council that the lease had expired and was closed on the 13th. However, due to the sudden closure, the losses were significant. The stage owner, Gu Zhuxuan, repeatedly appealed to the Municipal Council. The Council, sympathizing with the hardship of the business, agreed to compensate the loss with 100,000 taels of silver. The money was received in full a few days ago, and the matter was completely resolved.</p>
<h3>Police Station Seeks Owner of Recovered Fire Hose</h3>
<p>The Tilanqiao Police Station recovered a fire hose approximately 7.5 zhang long (approximately 25 meters), 2 cun (approximately 6.6 cm) in diameter, with copper caps at both ends, from a thief on October 19th. The owner can go to the Tilanqiao Police Station to claim it.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast for 4:30 PM yesterday stated:</p>
<p>The Yangtze River basin and coastal areas are cloudy with fog and relatively cold weather. Due to a low-pressure system moving east-northeast over the East China Sea, there is a moderate cyclone. There are northwesterly winds around Shandong, caused by a low-pressure system in Mongolia moving southeast-east. Yesterday, the highest temperature in Shanghai in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM was 67.6 degrees, and the lowest was 54.7 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 72.9 degrees, and the lowest was 49.5 degrees.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor-in-Chief,</p>
<p>Upon reviewing the twelfth page of your newspaper's local news section published on October 12th, there is an article about the magistrate's wife committing suicide, mentioning Zhou Shumei, the current magistrate of Ruian County, Zhejiang. Upon investigation, Zhou Shumei is actually the magistrate of Suian County, Zhejiang. It is presumed that the character "Sui" was mistakenly printed as "Rui" during typesetting. We kindly request that you check and correct the error as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Ruian County Government</p>
<p>October 17th</p>

<h3>A Word or Two</h3>

<p>A woman's heart is like kindling. Heat it, and it's as soft as cotton, clinging and inseparable; cool it, and it's as hard as stone, shattering at the touch.</p>
<p>It's easy to get a young girl for a wife, but hard to turn a woman into a companion.</p>

<p>When borrowing money from someone, you fear not seeing them; when the repayment date approaches, you fear seeing them.</p>
<p>If a woman invites you to go out, escape as quickly as possible if you can, otherwise you're doomed.</p>
<p>A woman's tears are like sweet dew, but also like poison, able to revive someone with a drop, but also able to kill someone with a drop.</p>

<h3>An Evening Conversation with an Officer of the Punitive Expedition</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>Since the rebellion of Yan and Feng, the Central Government has launched a punitive expedition. Several months have passed, and the war is about to end completely. The various armies on the front lines have successively reported victories and are returning in triumph. The Double Tenth Festival is being celebrated in addition to National Day. This can be regarded as a good sign for the future of the country. The Pukou Railway Station has been filled with the footsteps of triumphant troops in recent days. My friend, Tang Jun Ji'an, who serves in the military, has also come to the capital amidst the cheers of welcome, his clothes still covered in dust from the journey. He trimmed the candle and talked with me about the battle situation in Bian and Zheng. I will record his words to share with readers.</p>
<p>Feng's ambition was to defend to the death, aiming to fortify his walls and entrench his defenses to exhaust our troops. The trenches he built in Lanfeng were built based on the mountains for protection, spanning tens of feet in width and reaching several fathoms in depth, winding like dragons and snakes, arranged in layers, and mutually reinforcing each other. When the Central Army advanced fiercely, the morale of the Feng army wavered, and they retreated step by step. Liu Zhi, Chen Tiaoyuan, and others thoroughly inspected the Feng army's positions after the victory and praised the completeness of the fortifications. They noted that such trenches were rarely seen in recent wars in our country. However, although Feng was good at defending, the Central Army was even better at attacking. With the determination to sacrifice for the cause, they finally broke through his strong trenches in the final battle. The Central Army is known for its fighting prowess. In addition to the Training Division, Feng's army deeply feared the division of Jiang Guangnai. Feng's subordinates repeatedly encountered Jiang's division and would say to each other, "Here come those fellows again!" The meaning of their words reflected a deep admiration for Jiang's division's perseverance and unwavering courage. The soldiers of Jiang's division were mostly from Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou, and their repeated battles across several provinces left no opponent unscathed.</p>
<p>When Zhengzhou was under the control of Feng's army, at the outbreak of war, the residents were trapped in a dangerous city, living in constant fear. Central aircraft occasionally launched attacks, and the rebel army could not avoid them. They dug holes everywhere to avoid the targets. Many residents also lived in these holes, which were quite spacious, with front and rear entrances for entry and exit, and which could be opened and closed. To alleviate the stuffiness of long-term living underground, they installed pipes to provide ventilation. This underground life was no different from a dark hell. When bombs fell, landslides and cave-ins would occur, leading to live burials. Such tragedies were common. It was not until the Central Army drove straight in and established control that the city emerged from the darkness and saw the light of day again.</p>
<h3>The Rich Beggar</h3>
<p>— Qiushui</p>
<p>The two characters "(beggar)" make us think of "(no money)." It is only because they have no money that people become beggars. People who are beggars will never be rich. However, in reality, while rich people will certainly not beg from door to door, those who beg from door to door are not necessarily poor. Recently, I have heard two very interesting stories from friends and from Western newspapers. I will write them out to prove that what I say is not a fallacy.</p>
<p>Chinese Beggar Woman Commands Servants. The first story takes place locally. In a lane in the Shanghai Concession, a certain family surnamed Mou rented a two-story residence. There were no men in the household, only a mother and daughter, and they employed a nanny. The nanny, surnamed Wang, was from Ningbo. The person telling the story knew her well. According to the nanny, when she first came to work for the Mou family, she was surprised by the mother and daughter's sleeping during the day and going out at night. She constantly paid attention to their actions. The mother and daughter lived very extravagantly. Their food and living arrangements were very particular. They always got up in the afternoon around 2 or 3 o'clock. Around 5 or 6 o'clock, they would leave in a hurry, carrying bundles of clothes. They would not return until midnight. After returning, the nanny often saw the mother and daughter taking out copper coins and silver from their pockets, countless in number. The nanny became increasingly suspicious. One night, she decided to follow them. She lost track of them midway. Helpless, she wandered the streets to see what would happen. After walking for a long time, she reached the side of a large company on Nanjing Road. Suddenly, she saw a female beggar behind her, begging relentlessly. The nanny turned around and was shocked to see that it was her mistress. The female beggar, seeing that the person walking was her nanny, turned red with shame and left without saying a word. The next day, the mistress confessed everything and discussed it with the nanny, asking her to keep it a secret and promising her a higher salary. The matter was settled. A beggar woman renting a Western-style house and commanding servants is truly an odd thing.</p>
<p>Foreign Beggar with Car and Western-Style House. The second story is a foreign one and is even more interesting. According to recent reports, a man in Liverpool, England, recently committed suicide in his residence. He left behind a "confession" stating that he was a beggar by profession and had profited handsomely for ten years. He earned at least several shillings a day and owned a small Western-style house. He went out early and returned late, wandering the streets to do business that required no capital and little effort. The foreign beggar lived even more comfortably than the Chinese beggar woman mentioned above. This man, named Hanson, was only thirty-six years old when he died. The reason for his suicide remains a mystery. At the same time, there is another beggar in Liverpool who, according to Mr. Brass, the director of the inquiry department of the British Charity Association, earns 600 to 700 pounds a year. He owns a Western-style house and even has a car for recreation! He is a beggar by day and a gentleman by night. His life is more comfortable than that of anyone else. Mr. Brass also said that there is a young man in the same place who has received a commercial education. Initially, he was unemployed and his family was poor, so he pretended to be a victim of the European War. He used his eloquent pen to write letters to wealthy people, asking for assistance. The results were surprisingly good. From then on, he stopped seeking legitimate employment and hired two secretaries to write and mail such begging letters everywhere. His annual income was very high. He can also be considered a beggar with a novel approach.</p>
<h3>Strange Tale of a Cat Painting Catching a Mouse</h3>
<p>— Dong Ji</p>
<p>A friend came from Zhejiang Province and told me that there was a certain Jia Yizhen in Ningbo who was good at painting, especially birds and animals. He sat alone in his room all day long, washing brushes, practicing paper, admiring ancient styles, and mixing colors. He did nothing else. One day, after finishing dinner, he casually painted a cat and placed it on his desk. That night, a mouse came to the desk in search of food and suddenly saw the cat, baring its fangs and claws, vividly lifelike. The mouse was greatly frightened and turned to flee, but it slipped and fell into the spittoon. It couldn't jump out and drowned. Alas, the mouse's death was not due to the spittoon, but indirectly to the cat painting catching it. Even Sima Yi of the Three Kingdoms, known for his wisdom and courage, lost his nerve at the sight of a wooden statue, let alone a mouse. I record this.</p>
<h3>Talking About Drum Singing</h3>
<p>— Lao Can</p>
<p>There are now several styles of drum singing: Beijing Drum Singing, Fengtian Drum Singing, Shandong Drum Singing (also known as Pear Blossom Drum Singing), and Beijing-East Drum Singing (also known as Guest Drum Singing). All are named after places and have strong regional characteristics. However, Plum Blossom Drum Singing incorporates various tunes and is the most progressive. It resembles the new Tianjin tunes. Octagonal Drum is a specialty of the Manchus, originating from the victory songs of the Banner troops and not belonging to the drum singing category.</p>
<p>Pear Blossom Drum Singing is the oldest. "Pear Blossom" was originally called "Plowshare Shard," a piece of broken iron from a farm implement. Farmers sang agricultural songs, using broken and discarded farm implements, echoing the ancient practice of striking the earth and hitting wood. This shard was later specially made by ironworkers, and now it is mostly made of copper, gradually losing its original form. Pear Blossom Drum Singers are all from Shandong and sing full-length suites. Now, women mostly sing excerpts.</p>
<p>Beijing Drum Singing emerged with Liu Baoquan and Bai Yunpeng, and was then called Drum Singing. It emphasizes diction, uses vocals well, adds gestures and expressions, and follows drama closely. The rhythm uses flexible beats, breaking free from traditional patterns. It imitates the expressions and voices of characters in books vividly, so the singing is vivid, colorful, emotional, and reasonable. The beauty of the sound is unmatched. Singing "Ning Wu Pass," "Battle of Changsha," "Huarong Road," etc. (Gao Ting Company has records), is like a living dragon and a fierce tiger, making people's eyebrows dance and their faces flush. It is truly an exquisite skill. Bai Yunpeng's spirit is not substantial, so he is only suitable for stories of flowers and moonlight.</p>
<p>Regarding talent in Pear Blossom Drum Singing, "The Travels of Lao Can" praises Bai Niang. Those I have seen, such as Li Yuping and Li Da Wang, can be called masters. Some may dislike Pear Blossom Drum Singing for being too rustic, but its charm lies in this. The Shandong flavor and color are all in Pear Blossom Drum Singing. It must be heard.</p>
<p>Among the talent in Octagonal Drum, Chang Shutian and He Zhichen are outstanding. Those with elegant lyrics include "Returning Boat in Wind and Rain," and those with humorous lyrics include "Five Saints Ascend to Heaven" and "Cui Ping Mountain." "Five Saints Ascend to Heaven" has wonderfully beautiful lyrics that inspire imagination. I particularly enjoy listening to it.</p>
<p>Silver Screen News: Pei Si Kai Deng is known in the film industry as the king of cold-faced comedy. His previous films, such as "Sports Doctor," "Small Boat Owner," and "The Final Victory," were all sensations. The film "Pleasant and Leisurely," recently shown at Carlton, has also received excellent reviews. He recently starred in another film, "Flowers Fall, Water Flows." Not only are the jokes novel and abundant, but there are also several scenes, such as a lonely boat capsizing in the sea amidst alarming waves, Deng flipping over a sail blown into the air by a gale, and, when the ship catches fire, risking his life to rescue the beauty, and fighting fiercely with bandits at the bow of the ship, repeatedly being thrown into the ocean, which are all extremely thrilling. The plot is also tortuous and bizarre, attracting people's attention. The film will be released at the Paris Grand Theatre on the 23rd of this month (Thursday). (Xin Fu)</p>
<h3>Roman Art Observation Notes (3)</h3>
<p>— Wang Yachen</p>
<p>The murals in Roman churches are all famous works by previous great painters. We should pay special attention to them when studying art. The murals in St. Peter's and St. Paul's Cathedrals are all made of stone inlays. This cathedral has dozens of religious paintings inlaid with Raphael's drafts. The precision of its craftsmanship can be compared with the paintings of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>Speaking of the cathedral's architectural items, there is quite a history. There are three most famous cathedral domes in the world, namely London's Cathedral, Paris's Pantheon, and Rome's St. Peter's Cathedral. This cathedral dome was built by Michelangelo and is most valuable in architectural history.</p>
<p>Beneath the copper pavilion in the cathedral is the tomb of St. Peter. A platform is built in front of the tomb, with an open space in the center. Visitors can look down and see the tomb door. The platform is surrounded by more than a hundred oil lamps, lit all year round. Before Napoleon, they were made of pure gold. When Napoleon dominated Europe, he took the gold lamps. What exists now is of copper, only its style is ancient. Beside the copper pavilion, there is a bronze statue of St. Peter. According to the translator, this statue existed three hundred years before Peter was born. It is actually a famous Greek sculpture. Later, Peter's face was replaced. Those who do not know this mistakenly believe it to be from Peter's time. Believers must touch the toes of the statue. Now half of one left toe has been worn away. Touching the toe is just a superstition.</p>
<p>(1) The Pantheon Pabtgeon, Pantheon is the largest kind of construction. It can be translated as "Shrine of Saints and Sages" because the tombs of ancient celebrities are placed inside. What can be specially recorded here is the tomb of the great painter Raphael. There are many tombs of Roman popes placed in the shrine. Raphael was a painter, but he was also buried here with the royal family. It can be seen that the Romans of that time valued artists.</p>
<p>Raphael Rophael (1462-1520) was invited to Rome by the Roman Pope in 1508 to create the murals in the Sistine Chapel. He was the most favored by the Pope. His style was popular and pleasing, expressing a kind of love that made people feel intoxicated. Although he had a short life of only thirty-seven years, he left behind many magnificent achievements.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (299)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Episode 15: Tears of Sadness on All Sides, Yearning for Red Love, A Room Captivated, Lingering Green Intentions</p>
<p>Because of economic factors, families often become abnormal. Like the young master of the Yin family, he leans towards his mother's side, but only for the reason of asking his father for money. The first thing he will ask is your purpose. If your purpose is not correct, he will reject it. But there are many purposes that are inconvenient to disclose. The young master is somewhat dissatisfied with this. He says that if financial matters are to be made public, then they should all be made public. When it comes to unclear purposes, how often does his father report the purpose of the funds he spends? For this question, a country can often erupt in parliamentary impeachment and public complaint, and the Minister of Finance is so frightened that he dares not attend. Large families often have this kind of drama. The young master Yin wants to please his mother, so he spies on his father's actions. When he discovers some facts, he reports them to his mother and asks for a reward. At first, he was only helping his mother, but later, he became a spy to obtain rewards, even fabricating and embellishing the facts. One day, Mrs. Yin obtained a statement from the coachman Geng Sheng and discussed it with her advisor, the young master, saying, "I already used Geng Sheng to pretend to have done something meritorious. He said that the master lives in a small house on the bend of Baker Road. Where do you think Baker Road turns?" The young master said, "With these five words, 'Baker Road turns,' it will be easy to find. The first thing a detective needs is a clue. With a clue, you can use it to find it. I have now read several volumes of Sherlock Holmes' detective stories and have made great progress in detective science. I guarantee that I will find the master's small house by tomorrow morning. When the master is not at home, we can help you deal with him. What do you think?" "But tonight, I bought something that cost two hundred dollars. It's too much trouble to go to the accounting office to get it. Will you pay me?" Mrs. Yin scolded, "You little devil, you're taking advantage of the situation to extort me again. You just took one hundred and forty dollars last month. What did you use it for? Now you're asking for even more." The young master said, "It's not like that. I bought a gramophone and sent it home so everyone can listen to it. It saves us from running out at night. We can just listen to the gramophone every night, and it will pass the time." Mrs. Yin thought, "That's right. If we buy a gramophone, everyone can listen to it. This money can be accounted for in the future. Now that we are at war, it's reasonable for children to like to buy some toys." So, she gave him two hundred dollars and said, "Since you boast of your detective skills, tell me the address and street number of the master's small house tomorrow morning after you find it." The young master took the two hundred dollars, but he certainly didn't buy a gramophone. He probably sent it to some house. But having received the right, he cannot neglect the obligation. The detective work must be done.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Financial and Gold Market Shows Signs of Improvement Again</h3>
<p>Changes Occur Constantly. Yesterday, the 22nd, the gold price showed signs of recovery. The weighted average price broke through the 70 tael mark. However, instability was inherent during this period. When there was a trend to rise, the total fluctuation in the front and back markets was more than four taels. Foreign exchange seemed to be showing a profit. Banks mostly sold. Dealers tended to climb into the market. The buying and selling prices of various firms were very different. From the front market, Yuan Mao Yong, Yu Da Hua, Tai Wan Xing, Shun He, and those engaged in arbitrage trading bought considerably, and retail investors almost certainly covered their short positions. However, Heng Xing, Yuan Cheng, Yong Yi Feng, Yong, and others all sold. Market sentiment turned firm again. Although overseas silver markets rose, they still lacked upward momentum. Silver prices did not move, and exchange rates continued to rise. Thus, the gold price was initially flat. Afterwards, buyers became active, and the trend was diligent, gradually rising. Although exchange banks sold, the price never relented. By almost noon, it had exceeded 72 taels. However, there was an occasional fluctuation of one or two taels. Later, there were no large-volume transactions in the back market, and since it was Wednesday, the exchange market was weak, with only a little more than one tael of fluctuation. The final stable price was calculated at 72 taels and a fraction. As for silver bars, there were rumors of a downward trend.</p>
<p>The Initial Flatness is Followed by a Winning Streak. The opening price for December gold was 569.6 taels, only down 0.1 taels from the previous day's closing price (the gross price was between 71 taels and under 70 taels). This was because British silver bars only rose by 1/16, and New York silver prices did not change. Furthermore, the British-Japanese spread was plus 1/32, and the US-Canadian spread was plus 1/16. Therefore, market sentiment was still stable, but Heng Xing had already sold, immediately causing a drop to 69.1 taels. Soon after, Yu Da Hua, Tai Tai Heng, Yuan Zhi Feng, Yong, and others competed, causing a jump of one tael. Then, exchange rates followed closely, and the Dalian gang pushed the market up strongly. However, the banks suddenly became firm and raised prices. Banque Belge sold November gold at 1.27 taels, and Korea bought it at 1.26875 taels. Until the first clearing house announcement, it was 72 taels. The listed price did not move, and then rose again to 73 taels. Yuan Xing Yong and Heng Xing Yuan also bought. Soon after, due to a scramble for premiums and sales by Zhi Feng Yong Heng Xing, and sales of December British gold at 173.75 and November gold at 31.25 by banks like the British and Banque Belge, it fell by more than two taels and ten points to 70.03 taels. After a while, retail investors came to buy, raising it by one tael and ten points, and then by one tael and six cents. Banks were willing to sell British gold. Banque Belge continued to sell December gold at 173.75. Also, banks like Hua Bank and American-Japanese banks mutually traded. Citibank December gold traded at $39.25. Banque Belge and Mitsui also sold recent Dalian gold at 1.273125 taels. Banque Belge also sold January British gold at 174.375. As a result, gold prices turned downstream, and arbitrageurs took the opportunity to sell, breaking the 70 tael mark, at 11 o'clock, to 69.78 taels. Afterwards, Wan Xing Shun Li Da De Cheng and speculators came to buy. Moreover, since demand was strong and sellers were hesitant, there was a jump of more than three taels, trending sharply upward, reaching 73.5 taels near the close. After a while, it was 3.2 taels. The closing price did a small fraction, calculated as 2.45 to 2.8 taels, after which Yuan Mao Yong and others sold. The published price was still 618.6 taels, calculated to be pressed down by 45 to 6 taels.</p>
<p>The Market Calmly Settles Down. The after-market opened at 73.3 taels (gross price from 2.67 taels to more than 3 taels). Due to rumors that the Indian exchange rate had contracted by four annas, Yong Feng and others sold, reducing it by 6 or 7 cents, to 72.67 taels. Then, retail investors came in, reaching 73.34 taels after 2:15. Afterwards, it hovered around 3 taels. By 2:20, it had reduced its gains at the close, and the price was extremely flat, holding steady at around 73 taels for about half an hour. Around 3:30, Yi Feng Yong Yu Da and others tended to unload, causing a drop of more than one tael, to 71.7 taels at 3:45. Because the foreign exchange market was closed on Wednesday, retail investors immediately sought to buy, raising it by 5 or 6 cents, to around 72.3 taels around 4 o'clock. It rose and fell by 3 or 4 cents afterwards, and Yu Da sold quite a bit. At the closing bell at 4:30, it was calculated at 72.2 taels, and the closing price was up 2.5 taels compared to the previous day. The highest price for the day was 73.5 taels and the lowest price was 69.1 taels, a difference of 4.4 taels. The listed price was calculated at 46 or 47 taels. The account books showed 86 taels for this month, 82 taels for next month, and 72 taels for December. Supplementary water was 86 taels in the morning and 85 taels in the afternoon. The price for goods in the morning was 69.8 taels, the noon closing price was 72 taels, the afternoon price was 2.1 taels, and the closing price was 3.5 taels.</p>

<h3>Interest Rates Still Fall Back</h3>
<p>Market Overview. The foreign market situation seemed to be still stable during the past week. Although there were slight fluctuations, the results were generally similar. However, in the middle of this week, it suddenly sought lower prices. Although there were no sudden bursts, it was generally a decline. As for the trend of the money supply, current demand is indeed not weak. However, the silver reserves are flooded, and there is no way to arrange them. Furthermore, with the crowding of long-term loans coming due, it is even more impossible to arrange them. In the end, it is heading towards a path of easing.</p>
<p>Interest Rates (Foreign Interest). The morning rate was 7 cents, 2.5 mills, 6 haos, and 2.5 hus, weaker by 1 hao and 2.5 hus than the low price in the afternoon market of the previous day. Due to scarce transactions and weak competition in the afternoon market, the resulting market price was the same as in the morning market. (Silver discount) The morning rate only opened at 4%, and the afternoon rate was 5%, slightly weaker by one or two points than the previous day. There were no listed prices or additional water from banks.</p>

Copper coins were down another 1,000 cash, to 389,500 cash, with transactions totaling 32,000 strings.</p>
<p>Inflow and Outflow of Silver Dollars (Silver Funds). Yesterday, the bank's collection and delivery were similar to those in the past, and less than on Monday.

<h3>Continued Record of Long-Term News</h3>
<p>Recently, silver and money businesses have been moving forward bravely and making every effort to carry out long-term transactions. Yesterday, it was heard that both the northern and southern timber industries were initiating transactions, but both sides were holding their ground and had not yet concluded a deal. In the financial sector, the majority of the interest rates set by this gang in April were 8 taels and 2.5 cents. Since the rollover of this period cannot be increased slightly, the minimum should be the same as before (i.e., 8 taels and 2.5 cents). In the timber industry, it is generally said that from this autumn to the present, the war in Fujian Province has spread and the source of timber has been cut off, and the silver funds are useless, only consuming interest. Moreover, according to the general trend, it may be difficult to recover temporarily in these six months, and there is no hope of recovery. Instead of wasting silver interest in vain, it would be better to repay the long-term loans that are due. If it is necessary to roll over the loans, the interest rate should be slightly lower than the previous term, so that the burden can be slightly reduced. According to their tone, the highest interest rate they are willing to pay is only 8 taels, otherwise they will prepare to repay the loans. As a result of this difference of 2.5 cents, each party has held its ground based on their reasons, and the result has not yet been concluded. As far as one can see, it is feared that the financial sector will find it difficult to win, and most of them will not exceed 8 taels. Also, the miscellaneous grain, soybean, and rice gangs are also unwilling to continue to roll over their loans because the rice market has collapsed and business has become difficult. Most of them intend to repay, so most of them have not yet been decided. However, a small number have already made a deal, with prices around 10 taels, but large transactions have not been finalized, and this small number cannot be used as a standard.</p>
<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Market as Calm as Before</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures market was slightly strong, with more than 4.2 million in the morning and about 3.3 million in the afternoon, totaling 7.5 million.

The military bonds were not as active as before, accounting for 1.6 million. The Customs Tariff was only over 600,000, and the others were very clear. The spot market was deserted, with only 9,000 yuan in the front and back markets. As for the changes in various bonds yesterday, only the 19-year Customs Tariff had large households selling, although investment purchases were not lonely, and the price was still lower by 6 or 7 cents than the previous day, continuing to be extremely stable. Compared to the previous day, the 19-year cigarette futures rose by 4 cents, and the rest rose and fell mutually, with the amount only between one and two cents.</p>

Sales of the same-origin round-grained rice were slightly better, but there was no glory or disgrace in large-scale sales. Green-tip Southern Gang, Si Jing, Zhong, Bai Ge Bai rice market conditions all turned stable. Prices opened high at 13 yuan and 5 or 6 cents. Shipments of Yang Xiang Du Xiang rice were also rare. However, the inventory was still acceptable, so the market price remained at the original price. The South Road new overcast weather made sales very dull. It opened high at 13 yuan and a half.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Hovers with Slight Upswing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market generally showed a hovering trend for each month. At the beginning of this month, the sentiment was slightly fatigued due to the floating of more returns. Afterwards, the attitude of the major manufacturers was slightly tighter. The deliveries in the future should be scarcer than in the previous months. Also, since the inventory is not abundant, it is feared that it will not be possible to reach the 3-cent mark again. November was also tired at the beginning, but then followed the rising trend. As for December, due to the excessive backwardation, the market situation was particularly rising. The rest were all stable. Looking at the later steps, it seems that the foreign goods set by small factories cannot arrive immediately. The future is still looking good once sales become active. As a result, this month did not move, November was good by 0.25 mills, December was good by 0.2 cents, January was good by 0.75 mills, and February and March did not move.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Shows Slight Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, each month of the wheat futures showed slight weakness, because the quoted price of foreign wheat was small. Although the bulls in this month had the intention of receiving goods previously, perhaps they were all factory owners who were entering and exiting, so they still felt that they could not raise prices too much. Therefore, many parties sold out, and the short sellers were also willing to cover their positions, so the market turned flat. Due to slightly stronger selling, the prices of the far-term months also weakened slightly. As a result, this month was down by 0.3 cents from the previous day, November was down by 0.2 cents, and December to March was down by 0.1 cents. In the spot wheat market, high-quality goods are still tight. Intermediate and low grade flat, and total opening to Pinghu, Haizhou, Yao Wan, Ming wheat with more than one or two thousand bales, handled by Fufeng Xin Da.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods, Large-Grain Spring-Soaked Round Dates, Ground Price Difficult to Loosen</h3>
<p>Lower-Grade Red-Black Dates Prices Rise</p>
<p>Recently, Spring-Soaked Round Dates from Quanzhou have been slow to sell in Shanghai, and the various stores are mostly trying to sell them cheaply. Invisibly, the price has been reduced by about 2 cents. According to a survey, over 3,000 pieces have arrived by the Hua Xing ship from Quanzhou. According to various customer letters, the price for the upper grades is still very hard. In view of the Shanghai market, the trend is to fall. The exchange rate for this batch of goods should be expected to ease.</p>
<p>Prefectural Red Dates. Yesterday,</p>
<h3>Continuing Strong Sales of Gongxi Green Tea to Russia</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was no large-scale interest from England and France in the precious eyebrow and needle eyebrow green teas from the Road and Local Produce Guilds. Although the Duud Foreign Firm had a small number of telegraphic transactions for Hama-me tea, supply exceeded demand, and the market remained low. However, for Gongxi tea, the Russian merchant assistance association continued to show strong interest, and transactions were quite active. Qimen tea also had some scattered sales through this channel. Because the market has been sluggish for a long time, tea prices have fallen to the extreme, and tea merchants are losing no less than thirty to forty taels per dan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Market Prices Remain Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local cotton market saw fine cloth prices increase slightly, by two and a half to five fen.</p>
<p>Yesterday, two to three hundred pieces of 16-pound goods were sold, causing prices to rise across the board. There was also strong interest in 13-pound Shuang Ma, Ma Gou, Jiujiang, Datong, Anqing and other brands, so inventories were quite low. Merchants are still actively searching for fine materials from Guangzhou, and yesterday more than two hundred pieces of Flying Bear City and other brands were shipped. Yang He, Blue Double Fish, Wen Tai, and Ningbo goods continued to be purchased, so prices remained firm. Compared to fine cloth, these goods were priced five to six qian higher, which is rare in recent years. Coarse twills were also quite active, and inventories are gradually becoming scarce.</p>
<p>Prices for both Eastern and Western piece goods remained firm. Eastern goods, especially various types of serge, are almost depleted. Goods that were difficult to sell last spring are now unusually popular. Ma Yan serge sold for 2 qian and 6 fen; Luo Wen serge for 2 qian and 7 fen; Da Hui Wen for 2 qian and 6 fen. The price of Xiao Hui Wen, completely repaired and fine serge, continued to rise. Goods for lower garments have already cleared customs at 3 qian. Yang Guifei, Banana Leaf, and Title Book items were all priced at 3 qian and 5 li. Hu Xin Ting, Three Friends, Circus, Jin Wengong, and Tu Yuan serge all sold for 3 qian and 1 fen. Gu Cheng Hui also rose by 5 hui, opening at 3 qian and 4 fen yesterday. Bao Qiu, Assorted Colors, and Four Gentlemen Tu Yuan items are all out of stock. Sales to Qingdao, Changsha, Sichuan, and other regions were quite active. Western goods saw a rise in Straight Tribute Broadcloth yesterday, opening at 2 qian, 6 fen, and 2.5 li. Fifty pieces were sold to Sichuan merchants.</p>
<h3>Broadcloth Sales Tight, Both Officially and Unofficially</h3>
<p>Yesterday, woolen goods and broadcloth were very popular. Sales channels were firm across the board. The demand for Moultan and Huang Hui Hua Te broadcloth was particularly tight. Even with buyers offering sufficient prices, it was difficult to obtain these items. The extent of this price surge is truly unprecedented. Other thick and thin broadcloth and woolen goods also sold well, and sales conditions were tight, both officially and unofficially.</p>
<h3>Tinplate Market Still, But Ready to Move</h3>
<p>Recent transactions in English tinplate, driven by increasing purchases from export merchants, suggest the market may be poised for a move. Yesterday, merchants from Tianjin, Qingdao, and Niuzhuang bought a total of seven to eight hundred boxes of goods. The price was 13 taels and 7.5 qian per box for 90-pound tinplate and 14 taels and 7.5 qian for 100-pound tinplate. Market inventories were found to be very limited, and export merchants were competing to buy, boosting confidence and pushing prices higher. According to those familiar with the situation, once business with the Jing Han Kou store picks up, the market outlook is sure to improve.</p>

<h3>Law School Legal Research Association Held a Lecture Yesterday</h3>
<p>Regarding the past history and work situation of the Law School Legal Research Association, this journal has published articles from time to time and there is no need to repeat them. We now know that the Association held its first lecture in the seventh classroom at 4 pm yesterday (according to this association, it is one of the special committees affiliated with the Legal Research Association). Ms. Jin Guangmei served as the chairman, and more than 30 members attended the meeting. Many other students also came to listen. First, the chairman made a brief opening statement, and then the lecture began, in the order of the topics submitted in advance: (1) Mr. Wang Jijin spoke on "How to fundamentally eradicate bandits and communists"; (2) Mr. He Qingyuan spoke on "Law and Time"; (3) Mr. Huang Guocui spoke on "The Development and Changes of Social Concepts"; (4) Mr. Deng Moujia spoke on "Will the Second World War occur in the Pacific?" The grand theories lasted for two hours. Because of the time, there were still several members who had submitted topics in advance, but there was no time for lectures, so they had to wait until next week. Although the atmosphere in the venue was still quiet and the listeners were still full of energy, at six o'clock, everyone inevitably felt hungry. Helpless, the chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting. The chairman's closing remarks at that time can also be called a preview. An excerpt is as follows:</p>
<p>(Although there are still a few people who haven’t spoken, time does not allow it, so we have to leave it to the next session. Of course, we should deeply express our apologies to these students. But at the same time, it is also extremely gratifying. We have achieved such results today, and everyone is so energetic. This sincerity in being enthusiastic about the association is fully expressed, which is truly gratifying. Here, I must report one thing to everyone: we have been locked in this room for so long, and we have been listening to some emotionless social sciences. Of course, exchanging knowledge and practicing eloquence are equally important, and you should not be tired of it. However, social science is fundamentally rational. In other words, what we talk about and listen to is purely rational, lacking emotion, too serious and not a little playful. This is like eating a stomach full of food without being able to digest it. I think you may be feeling too bloated. I intend to do some conditioning work and make coffee and tea after dinner to help you digest. Because everyone has to prepare very good social science materials every time, I might as well change the air and adjust the taste to increase everyone's interest. I think it's okay to talk about other issues, even love issues, social issues, co-education issues, the issue of lovers and friends, etc. We don't care whether they are valuable or not, just to adjust our tastes. I don't know what you think. If you think there are any points that can be adopted, then I can be responsible for this task, and please convey it to other members who are not here today.)</p>
<p>After the speech, there was a lot of applause, which must have been welcomed by the listeners. It is expected that at the second lecture, members will be even more enthusiastic, and the grand occasion will be sincere. (Yi De)</p>

<h3>The Jinan University Law School Holds a Teacher-Student Gathering</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of Jinan University Law School this year and the appointment of Wang Renlin as the Dean, the school affairs have been proceeding exceptionally orderly and smoothly. The professors and lecturers hired are mostly well-known scholars of the time, who are all responsible and provide guidance. The students are also able to study diligently, each benefiting from it. As a result, the relationship between teachers and students has become more harmonious. It is now reported that a grand teacher-student gathering will be held in the shortest possible time to regulate the boredom of studying on weekdays and to connect the emotions of all teachers and students in the college. Staff are currently being selected and preparations are underway. The expenses are mostly from donations, and the location is said to be a famous garden at sea. The richness and exquisiteness of the games and refreshments can be said without saying. (Lu)</p>
<h3>Jinan University Hires a New American Lecturer</h3>
<p>The School of Business at Jinan University recently hired Dr. C. F. Rmere, a professor from the University of Michigan in the United States, as a special lecturer. Dr. Lei came to China from the United States to specialize in studying the commercial situation in our country. At the same time, he was hired by Jinan University to give a lecture once every two weeks. The topics discussed are quite valuable. The topics are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) The Relationship between Modern Economic Development and Politics</p>
<p>(2) The Recent Economic Status of the United States Internationally</p>
<p>(3) The German Reparations Issue</p>
<p>(4) The Impact of Silver Price Decline on China's Foreign Trade</p>
<p>(5) A Study of Foreign Investment in China</p>
<p>(6) An Explanation of the Balance of International Trade</p>
<p>It is now reported that Dr. Lei is scheduled to give his first lecture starting on the 16th. His speech will definitely have a performance and value. (Lu)</p>
