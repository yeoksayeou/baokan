<h3 id="c6">波蘭新内閣成立後之政局 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>波蘭之政局。極不穏定。自憲法宣布以來。内閣之改組。不知若干次矣。今之新内閣。雖又告成立。總理雖已易爲史拉夫克。然向所著名之狄克推多畢蘇斯基氏。仍掌陸軍。仍欲進行向來之主張。以達其未達之目的。則去政局隠定之希望尙遙遠也。</p>
<p>畢蘇斯基氏在憲法未制定前。即任國家元首。亦爲革命黨領袖。不可謂非新波蘭之一元勳。一九二二年憲法公布。國會成立。畢氏始引退。然其後因政變屢起。國會中之黨派。紛擾不息。畢氏不能坐視。復於十九二六年。發表宣言。謂波政局之所以不安定。由於行政方面權力太弱。立法機關權力太大。今後改革。須從設立强有力之政府入手。於是率軍直赴波京。經三日之巷戰。政權遂重握於畢氏手中。惟確不願親執行政大權。而願永久掌握陸軍。做一不出面之狄克推多。故以後國會選舉行政首領。多由畢氏推薦。畢氏統制全國三十萬軍隊。即由斯起。惟自畢氏暗中執行大權以後。雖極力設法使政府强固。然仍未達到目的。政潮依然繼續發現。是畢氏政策之試騐。成效已彰彰矣。</p>
<p>此次波内閣之改組。雖爲國會通過不信任勞工總長案而起然據報載。事前已有畢氏行將干政之種種推測謂畢主張停開國會。組設半棒喝黨政府。又謂將由其屬員齊曼斯基或其弟燕恩出面組閣。并向國會提出議員不得干涉政府行政等要求。今雖出面組閣者爲史拉夫克氏。而已則仍長陸軍。是畢氏仍欲爲不出面之狄克推多。且欲進一步以達其組設强有力政府之目的。已顯然可見。目前若意若士若奥若德。皆盛倡强有力政府説。或已成。或未成。皆亟亟進行。不可謂非棒喝主義之大行於歐洲。惟當民主政治迅速發展之時。此主義在此潮流中。究能支撑至若何程度。吾人實未敢預料。况乎波蘭之民族。又以愛自由稱。其政黨中之新勢力。亦日有所進步。畢氏之政策。果能安然進行以達其目的耶。更非所知矣。</p>

<h3 id="c94">引言　　（崇淦） <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>轟轟烈烈之全國運動會、於今日在杭開幕矣、全國男女健兒二千人、會萃於西子湖畔、各獻好身手、誠爲空前之盛舉、誰謂我民族無尙武精神哉、</p>
<p>大會舉行之目的、在提倡全國體育、適値第九屆遠東運動會、於本年五月在日本舉行、乘此機會遴選成績優良者、赴日出席、爲我國一爭光榮、</p>
<p>此次大會、特色甚多、爰述數點於左、</p>
<p>一、大會係政府議决舉行、而各省市羣起追隨、先開預選大會、民衆踊踴躍參加、選擇代表赴杭比賽、此可見全國人民合作之精神、</p>
<p>一、以前運動人員、皆爲學生、而政工商各界不與焉、近來提倡業餘運動、頗爲努力、赴大會比賽者、各界皆有人參與、此可見全國運動之普及、</p>
<p>一、我國女子素以嬌小文秀爲美觀、不出遠道爲習尙、而今一般肌肉豐滿短衣露腿矯健美麗之女子、雄糾糾馳騁於運動塲上、雖東北西南兩隅、亦不嫌路途之䟦涉、均來北賽、可見我國體育已普及於女子、</p>
<p>此外記者對於當軸及運動諸君、有不能已於言者、尙有三點、</p>
<p>一、大會因經人才、均甚充足、籌備手續、井井有條、今日開始比賽、進行必能順利、但此次盛舉、不可使其曇花一現、比賽完畢、即爲陳跡、願我當軸、年撥的欵、提倡全國民衆體育、乘此體學專家會集之時、籌畫適當提倡方法、强我民族根本要圖、豈可忽略之哉、</p>
<p>一、運動員參加比賽、固當求名次之前、成績之佳、然更應抱「仁俠」精神恪守運動規則、服從裁判命令、寗失錦標、毋傷道德、</p>
<p>一、此次參加大會、都有相當的能力而體質强健與外人練習機會較多者、優勝地位比較的有把握、然不可因此自傲、彼成績較遜之運動員、或以身體關係、或少練習機會、亦不必自餒、蓋大會之舉行、以提倡體育爲目的、錦標不過爲鼓勵之物耳、能蒞會比賽者、已爲運動之健將矣、本報對於體育、提倡不遺餘力、此次全國</p>
<p>運動大會、更應儘量宣傳、預祝大會之成功、聯貢芻蕘之獻、或爲大會諸君所許乎</p>
<h3 id="c95">大會之意義　　朱家驊 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>在這春色明媚的時節裏、這籌備數月的全國運動大會、居然在光華燦爛的西子湖濱開幕了、這是一件何等可欣忭的事情、</p>
<p>我國是久被列强嗤爲「東亞病夫」的國家、但是這也是無足自諱的、只看我們國内的青年有幾個不是而黄肌瘦弱不勝衣青年尙且如此、其他的更不必談了、假使以我國的國民和列强的來比擬、便要立刻感到「相形見絀」、列强説我們是病夫、固然是一種嘲笑的話、其實也是給我們一種良好的針砭、我們該知道要有健全的精神、必先有健全的體格、集合千千萬萬具有健全體格的國民才能造成一個健全的民族、亦惟健全的民族、才能創造健全的文化我中華民族、本是一個富有創造精神的民族、只因文弱之風歷代相沿、致國民體育日就衰靡、由肉體波及精神遂使整個的民族、陷於苟且偷安而固有的創造能力亦幾因之喪失無遺這幾年來因和别的</p>

<p>强健民族相接觸、受他們的壓迫才悟到我們國衰弱的原因、最大的還是因爲國民體力的衰弱、所以體育的問題、也逐漸引起了國人的注意、在通商都市的報紙裏、我們已天天可以見到關於運動比賽的新聞、就全國運動會而言、在過去也已舉行過二三次、現在民衆對於禮育運動的興趣、正是有加無已、所以這次的運動大會、比較從前的幾次一定能發揮更深刻和廣大的意義</p>
<p>我們覺得這次大會的意義、第一點値我們認識的就是言次大會是中央决定的、中央所以决定這個大會也有兩層意思第一層、國内革命的對象、身閥現在已被革命的勢力摧毁殆盡、此後革命的方向、必須轉移向外、换句話説、就是要去實行打倒帝國主義、但是帝國主義壁壨的深厚、决非像國内的軍閥那般容易摧毁、要去打倒帝國主義必須有相當的準備才行、否則雖日日高喊打倒口號還是不中用的、别的不講、先講我們國民的體格、都像病夫一樣、舉起兩手拿一技槍還有覺吃力的、如果要以這般病夫去抵抗列强的勇士、那眞是太不自量了、所以要打倒帝國主義、還應當從鍛鍊國民的體格做起、第二層現在已到了訓政時期的最要工作、就是建設、不過一個社會或國家經過了重大的破壞以後、要重新建設一個新的社會或國家、是一件艱鉅的工作、這種艱鉅的工作、决不是衰頽的國民所能擔當得了所以凡是我們中國的國民都應知道「革命」而努力體育爲「建設」而努力體育、</p>
<p>第二點値得我們注意的、就是這次運動選手產生的方法、和歷屆不同、從前是適用華東華南華北華西中分區運動會的產生方法、這次則以省特别市及海外華僑團體爲單位、其所以改用這個辦法的意思是要全國的運動家在政府的領導和奬勵之下、能够普遍的總動員起來我們相信在這一次會裏、一定可以發見各地許多新進的運動家一　出他的驚人的紀錄、並希望以後大家望風興起如民衆運動會業餘運動會等等、均能接續的舉行起來、</p>
<p>從前的一般運動員有種錯誤觀念、就是「爲運動而運動」或是「爲錦標而運動」、如説「爲運動而運動」正如説「爲吃飯而吃飯讀書而讀書」等一樣的無意義如説「爲錦標而運動」則正如説「爲考試而讀書、爲畢業文憑而讀書」、那更是可笑了、運動的目的、説得狹一些就是爲求個人體育的發達、不過個人不能離社會而存在、所以進一步説除了爲求個人體育的發達以外、還要求社會全體體育的發達、我們希望這次到會的運動選手、都能够把從前錯誤的觀念完全的打破、同時並知道這次開會的宗旨、是在發展國民的體育和振作民族的精神、</p>
<h3 id="c97">全會小史 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>全國運動會創始於前清宣統二年、迄今二十餘載、先後舉行三次大會、第一次即在宣統二年（西曆一千九百十一年）舉行於南京南洋勸業會塲、第二次於民國三年即西曆一千九百十四年舉行於北京天壇、此兩次大會所有出席團體、及運動項目、與計分方法等、均不合法定規則、即如會中職員、亦多屬西人、蓋當時我國人士辦理體育事業者、尙少學識經騐、關於運動會之設施籌備、不得不假重於西人也、自民國十三年在武昌開第三屆大會時、方有正式之組織、一切規則、悉照遠東運動會所規定者、故正式之全國運動會、當以第三屆爲始、餘如第七第八兩次遠東運動會舉行之前、吾國爲挑選出席代表起見、均有全國預選會之舉行、規模宏大、盛極一時、而正式稱爲全國運動會者、僅三屆耳、</p>
<p>前年全國體育恊進會董事會議决、於去年十月間原定在廣州開第四屆全國大會、同時因浙省政府、亦有全國運動會之發起、乃將去年廣州之會取消、而有今日西湖之盛會、</p>
<h3 id="c98">籌備之經過 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>

<p>最强者當推上海</p>
<p>可惜香港隊不出席</p>
<p>參加者十二隊現因北平不來、剩十一隊、實力最强者、當推上海、此種錦標、可操必勝之權、其次爲廣東天津遼寗三隊、稱强國内之香港隊、未曾報名出席、爲一遺憾、否則對峙於决賽之局、必能吸引滬上數千觀衆之赴會也、</p>

<p>上海神户天津最有希望</p>
<p>此項運動、爲此次大會報名最踴躍而競爭最烈者、調查强隊、其數凡六、一日天津、二日北平、三日廣東、以上在秩序之上半部、四日上海、五日神户、六日遼寗、此三隊在秩序之下半部、戰鬥經騐與實力最足者、尤當推天津北平上海三隊、錦標當不出此一隊也、軍容威武、鬥志堅實最後勝利、不知究竟誰屬、</p>

<p>可惜第二週即相遇</p>
<p>香港最强、該隊在出發之前、曾戰勝廣東、上海亦殊利害、雄心勃勃、志在必取冠軍、人所不甚注意之福建隊、亦頗可怕、按秩序、香港與上海在第二週中、即欲相遇、實一不幸、蓋上海香港、乃惟一之勁敵也、</p>

<p>上海香港好手均未報名</p>
<p>錦標一席無從推測</p>
<p>上海與香港兩方、本均有資格極老之球員、但因遠東代表權、體育恊進會已决定付諸憻香山隊、故雙方好手、俱未報名、僅由二等選手參加比賽、故錦標一席、無從推測、天津亦有極好機會、</p>

<p>今日爲全國運動會開幕之期、滬杭車上備極熱鬧、計昨日來杭之要人、有王正廷·褚民誼·蔣夢　·張我華等、本報記者亦於昨晨八時乘特别快車由滬赴杭、七時到車站、售票處已萬頭攢動、想見擁擠之狀、入車箱後、三等已無插足地、二等亦早客滿、勉强在頭等車中覓得一席地、未幾東北馮庸大學校長馮庸氏、及褚民誼洪深君等接踵而至、記者趨前、向與握手言歡、記者與馮年前在遼有一面緣、車中晤談、津津有味、馮服黑呢校服、態度整肅、額際微有傷痕、則飛機在蘇州附近降下時之成績也、馮謂是日飛至該處、雨大天暗、勢不得不下降、機雖稍損、人未受傷、亦大幸事、</p>

<p>東北怪傑劉長春氏、自百米以十秒六破全國紀錄後、國人耳目爲之一驚、記者曾以劉詢馮、據云、劉爲大連人、具有短跑天才、在校中隨便跑跑、即能得十秒八九成績、但天才進步頗爲困難、再須加以堅苦不斷的練習、前途庶有希望、劉君現抱病未痊、成績頗爲减色、但以事關全國、不得不勉力參與耳、</p>

<p>馮又云、遼寗氣候較南方特冷、對於田賽之練習上、頗感困難、故年來遼寗成績、頗不易突飛猛進、此亦關於地理者也、幸當局提倡甚加、設備亦頗週到、得有今日之效果、殊非易易、</p>

<p>馮庸大學足球隊、在華北素負盛舉、此次代表遼寗南來作戰、實力未易輕視、馮亦極爲注重、昨在車中頻展視足球秩序單、且謂記者、該校近聘燕大畢業生足球健將古治安及李桂林兩君擔任敎練、頗望將來能訓成勁旅、其熱心可見一斑、</p>

<p>吃飯問題之趣聞　會塲備大飯廳足供三百席同時用膳、廚房中雇有燒火者十餘人、製藥者二十人打雜者四十人挑菜淘米者二十餘人、共有百餘人之多、如此大廚房、火頭可以成軍矣、惟飯廳四週、毫無遮攔、任憑風吹雨打日來氣候又冷、以致菜無熱食、運動員遠道而來、温煖熱腸難容冷味、頗多不慣本埠某女選手、臨食時不能下咽、泣下沾襟、斯亦趣矣、又與遼寗選手偕來者有一歐人、操華語甚熟據云係担任球類敎師日與選手爲伍、吃飯時用筷挑飯、箝菜而食、雙手幾無所措、日來已與北方健兒、同食麵包故不復再窘狀矣、</p>
<p>碗盤之精密統計　大飯廳中、一切傢具之統計如下、桌二百四十、凳九百六十、飯碗一千九百二十只、預備軍不計、菜碗九百二十只洋盆九百六十只、大飯桶六十具、調羹一千九百二十只筷三千八百四十根、</p>
<p>生意興隆通四海　會塲門處一隅、四週無市集而運動員及職員愈聚愈多、香烟點心在在所需最初之數日、竟無物可買、日來各處小販、紛紛趕來做投機生意大會宿舍附近、尙有一臨時商店、每日營業收入有七八十元之譜云</p>
<p>疑是置身跳舞塲　各塲布置頗形美觀尤以籃球塲最爲特色、塲地以杉木條板舖成、加以油漆、光亮奪目、不知者幾疑爲跳無之塲、角逐時足底柔軟、舉步輕捷男者健兒在未開幕以前、光臨一顧、莫不趨前跳上幾步却爾斯登之舞、</p>

<p>蔣主席湖濱一笑　前（三十）日湖濱路至岳墳一帶、接放步哨、交通斷絶三小時、盛傳蔣氏以來杭觀光全運、乘興游湖、實則蔣氏斯日並未至湖上、昨（三十一）日清晨、蔣氏輕步簡從、漫遊湖濱瞻仰陳英士銅像、徘徊久之、市人多未知、會有廣東女選手數人、亦乘晨光義微、來湖濱間眺、一見知爲蔣主席、相率竚步凝視、俄而粲然、蔣氏遂報以一笑而去、</p>

<p>市執委會　昨日本市新執行委員會、在市黨部三樓、舉行第一次總理紀念週、由陳德徵主席、並作政治報告、其詞云、今天是本市新執行委員會成立後第一次舉行總理紀念週、恰巧是三月的最後一日、這是結束已往、開展未來的重要的一日、再過一天、明天便是四月一號、是全年四分之一、是一個「夸特」、這是含有重要的意義的、我們在這一天、便要反問自己、我們在黨務上的工作、是否也已完成了四分之一、在這一個時期的階段中間、雖然因爲改造及其他事務、佔去了一些時間、但在民國十九年過去三個月内、我們對於已往所未有努力的、以及將來怎樣努力的計劃、在今日的一天、都給我們一個重要的啟示、我們想起國事也是如此、在過去混沌的狀態中、許多莫名其妙的軍閥、游離不定、莫可捉摸、但是到了現在情况、顯露涇渭分明的時期、我們看定、反革命者終究是反革命、革命者終究是革命者、反革命者、以民族利益供個人權利私慾的犧牲、他們本來的眞面目、已完全畢露了、馮玉祥從建安村被閻錫山放出來、便回到陜西、重做他反叛中央以反民族利益的工作、閻錫山現在已除去他禮爲國的假面具、只去做爲他個人打算的事、其中還有從前所謂革命的一班浮蕩少年·昏庸老朽、如汪兆銘·陳公博·黄少谷·謝持·鄒魯·覃振之流、以及從前爲總理最痛恨而始終不肯悔過的陳炯明、到現在又去組成這一個反動的大集團、或是替他們做牽線、供奔走、情况到了現在的地步、眞是越加顯出了反革命者終究是反革命、革命者終究是革命者、在北方反動的集團中、固然各有各的打算、終歸要是失敗、但是目前在事實上、這種反動集團、在北方的興起、不但阻滯了黨務的發展、阻礙了政</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>治的進步、並且堕損了國家的威信、在從前還有人莫名其妙的説汪兆銘、只差是耳朶太軟了、但是還有相當的革命歷史、現在我們看、汪兆銘是不是叛黨一個革命者、是不是只管手段、不管目的的去胡鬧、只要中央傾覆、什麽都可以去勾結、縱然説從前有相當的革命歷史、現在是不是已在躉批的販賣革命歷史、所以在從前混沌的狀態中、汪兆銘還被認爲是革命同志、現在汪兆銘的狐狸尾巴露出來了、在事實上的表演、革命終是革命的、反革命終是反革命的、爲了權利、變了節操、叛黨叛總理的汪兆銘、是不是總理的叛徙、這一點弄清楚、我們此後的工作、便應從此處着手、不要再蹈從前的覆轍、因爲在過往的混沌狀態中、反革命者與革命者相混淆、涇渭不分、所以在工作方面、便有濡滯的病態、現在革命者與反革命者、分别得非常顯明、此後十九年的四分之三的時間、我們要切實的做反反革命的工作、應明是非、辨義利、謝持鄒魯陳公博汪兆銘等底反動、借做我們的鏡子、我們要盡力協助中央、奠定革命勝利後的和平統一的局面、這一點意義、雖然簡單、但是以後我們在修養和努力方面、都從這一點發揚出去、將來所收的效果、非常的大、現在縱然除去過往四分之一的時間不論將來還可收得全年四分之三的成效、希望諸位認識些簡單的意義、加緊努力、</p>
<p>警備司令部　昨日浙滬警備司令部全體官佐、在大禮堂舉行總理紀念週、熊司令主席、禮畢、司令訓話、略謂、擅專與獨斷二事、表面雖頗相類似、實際上却大有分别、擅專就是不屬自己職權以内的事、敢於動手去做、其結果往往僨事、但是遇長官外出、事情又急須處置的時候、如果每個人都不肯負責不作主張、其結果必至廢事、這裏就需要獨斷的精神、所謂獨斷、在軍隊中是依據作戰的要領和上官的意思、可以不待命令而先行動作、在機關中是依據一切的規則條例去做、有時也可以不必請示長官、這兩點、望各職員注意云云、</p>

<p>匪窟遭遇　肉票嚴如齡今年已六十二歲、平時精神頗爲矍鑠、自入匪窟、生活上大受影響、據伊自述、匪等待遇、殊爲刻苦、每日進餐、祇給鹽蛋一枚而已、看票者三四人不等、一形似匪首者、常來張望、日前忽語嚴云、現在風聲不好、或有難爲足下處、望勿見怪、言中有撕票意、幸法捕房緝捕甚力、卒能化險爲夷、爲探捕等入室時、看票者執槍在手、向房門處開放、嚴覩狀大驚、用被自蒙其首、以資躱禦、直至綁票就擒、始覺神智稍清、回憶前情、尙有餘恐也、</p>

<h3 id="c232">鑲金齒的趣史 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>説者謂鑲金齒之風。盛行於近時。其淵源當不甚遠。實則加以考據。德國三百年前。業鍍金者。已能操此術。而莫尼堪醫藥週刊。且根據從前記錄。載有最初發見金齒時之一段趣史。讀之頗堪解頣。大可供茶餘酒後之談助焉。</p>
<p>西歷一千五百九十三年。德有某農之子名摩勒者。年祇八歲。而一齒燦爛作金色。當時見者莫不驚異。風聲所播。居然引起醫學界之注意。於是罕慕司丹大學藥劑敎授霍斯德博士。特將該童之齒。加以審查。結果决定其爲天然的金齒。並用拉丁文發表其意見。後復譯成德文。聳動社會。視爲新發見之一種事物也。據德國多數人迷信的理想。竟謂金齒爲上帝所表示。可知上帝尙在德國民間云云。摩勒不自足。乘機獻身於大庭廣衆之間。露厥輝煌之齒。以供人觀覽。藉博厚利。不意時日稍久。金齒中間。遂間現白色。衆多懷疑。復施檢查。始知天生的金齒。實際乃用人工鑲鍍而成。黑幕旣明。摩亦就逮。卒由官廳治以欺衆歛錢之罪云。</p>

<p>— 程志政</p>
<p>遐邇馳譽之交通大學。自遜清光緒二十二年由盛宣懷氏奏創以來。迄乎今日。已有三十四寒暑。其間雖名號迭更。學系稍變。然其一貫之前進精神。初不稍懈。乃者自孫哲生氏兼長該校以後。内部大加刷新。尤飛皇騰達。蓬勃有生氣。日前（二十八日）爲該校三十四週紀念辰。適逢新宿舍「執信西齋」落成。因同時舉行兩大盛典。並開放男女宿舍。任人參觀。其間花花絮絮。有足記者。爰就所憶。錄告讀者。</p>
<p>絢爛綺麗　事前。該校當局爲鄭重起見。特組籌備委員會進行一切。一切佈置。均極可觀。如入門時。除見黨國旗外。尙有柏枝鮮花等。紮成五彩。又懸一長聯云「溯聲名普遍寰球。蔚然人才千萬輩。是東南最高學府。屈指成年卅四周」亦係用美術繪製者。餘若鐘樓高處綴以電炬。旗桿週身裏以明燈。皆富匠心。極饒興味。窮絢麗之能事矣。</p>
<p>朱執信之小軼事　十一時。舉行執信西齋落成典禮。到來寳楊杏佛及西人多人。首由黎照寰氏致詞。述本校未來計劃之偉大。此不過其嚆矢耳。繼請鐵部代表梁寒操參事述朱執信先生之事跡（按執信西齋即係紀念朱先生者）梁氏云。朱烈士天資極聰頴。彼之數學。全自從中國古籍中得來。三四位之乘法。一觀即得。在日本時。所習者爲政治經濟。然其數學之精。爲專習此道者所不及。每遇難題。辄請朱烈士代爲解答。而對明密碼電報。尤不待查對。即知其意。天分之高。逈非常人所可及也。惟烈士在日本時。獨留一辮不肯去。雖胡展堂促之至再。必厲聲拒絶。寗死不從。有知其故者。謂係其姑母之臨别囑命。然革命之初。黨人多以無辮而不能公然活動。氏獨能之。於此可知其用意之深長矣。詞畢由黎梁二氏揭幕。於是胡漢民所書之執信西齋四字。遂赫然現於吾人之目前矣。</p>
<p>齋前之花圃　齋前隙地。近築一花圃。正中築一荷池。四圍均草地。碧草平舖。花影扶疎。臨流小坐。彷彿置身於法國公園。洵佳境也。</p>

<p>— 白沙淚痕</p>
<p>十年以還。輪困於工廠中。消磨於機械生活上。厥狀乃不啻耕牛推磨兩目障以罩。使不獲旁視。而盡力狂奔。清夜靜思。嘗爲之啞然失笑。愀然興悲也。尤以漫漫長夜時。於機聲軋軋中。督同彼傖夫俗子。鄕女村姑。栗碌到天明之工作。爲最慘淡。此種以夜爲日之生活。其困苦旣如牛。而行動乃如鼠矣。嗟乎。衣食之謀。乃須累人如此。我又何必荷此圓顱。踏此方趾。而求爲人乎。</p>
<p>我國昔日之棉紡技藝。惟農家婦女習之。篝燈夜績。辛勤萬分。所獲者不過寸縑尺素。以之禦一人寒尙不足。迨自紡織機發明后。乃有集資數百萬。策工數千人。經營一廠。晝夜不息。寒署無間。一日所產之紗布。以之禦千百人寒尙有餘。論理小民生計。固應裕矣。庸詎知凋蔽艱難。尙不如昔邪。甚矣。太戈爾氏之言曰。「我願中國人守樸歸眞。長保持其貧窮。切勿追求他人之物質文明。」細味斯言。其亦庽有深意乎。</p>
<p>海上紡紗廠之工人。女了佔十之七八。皆來自江南江北之田間。其中以少女少婦爲多。童女次之。老嫗又次之。彼等寗棄其鄕村中（舒適而自然）之生活。來此都市中。作此牛馬生活。而不自悲其苦者。何也。金錢環境。役之使然耳。</p>
<p>紗廠工女。以在細紗部份者。爲最有精彩。間嘗見裙布荆釵。綽約多姿者。爲做夜工宵來無寐故。夭桃之臉。乃如輕敷一層黄臘。其豐韻者。誠有如曹雪芹所謂之王熙鳳。瘦弱者乃有如林黛玉。他若豐容盛鬋如潘雪艶。蹁躚善跳如黎明睴者。均爲好事者狀其神似。而錫之别號。鶑鶑燕燕。誠不一而足也。儕輩工作至午夜。倦而欲寐時。苟執筆比擬之。辄學芳氣襲人。睡魔倒避三舍矣。</p>
<p>姿首稍佳之工女。大都處於惡劣環境之中。而不能自振拔者。蓋伊於廠中。爲工作上之需要。往往不得不受彼機匠加油等之支配。迨到廠外。則有一班流氓白相人之恐嚇誘騙。惡劣環境之來。在在均足以搖蕩伊之心旌。而不能自主矣。因之桑間濮上之行。乃恬不爲怪。即彼紡織工業最發達之日本。凡女子一經入紗廠爲工女則。伊之一生幸福。亦從此休矣。故紗廠工女。照現在中日情形。均甚賤視之也。</p>

<p>次日劇界中人來觀者甚多。僉認爲是眞藝術。殊致欽仰。故此數日問街談巷議。無不以梅劇爲唯一之資料。而梅蘭芳三字之名。益震人耳鼓矣。原定祇演兩禮拜。自開演之日起。兩禮拜之票皆已售完。此兩禮拜中。擬不改劇目。據外人云。即三個月内亦不必更改。近日常有人問何日演楊貴妃者。然團人主張暫不改劇目。園主亦同此意也。</p>
<p>前日公使館來信云。總統欲晤畹華。囑外交總長與我國公使言及。請其介紹。問可否再到華盛頓演奏。現正接洽未定。至其他各大城往演與否。亦在接洽中。哥倫布大學亦約往演劇。并竭力言定能賣滿座。此於身分有關。將來亦不得不前往一演也。</p>
<p>前日音樂會開會歡迎畹華。與會者皆編劇家。歌唱家。音樂家。凡三百餘人。畹華演説。大旨謂兩國國民感情。用美術藝術連絡最易。且易得好感。（全塲大鼓掌）此次來美。係欲研究美國藝術。以備歸對祖國。有所供獻。嗣該會會長答詞云。梅君欲在美國得點藝術回國。其實結果梅君須留下點藝術在美國。全塲大鼓掌。數日來大歡迎會有數次之多。不暇詳述。照像館託人介紹來攝影者。亦日有數起。</p>
<p>紐約各大文豪來訪談者已有十餘人。如楊士塔氏Stark　Young乃大文豪之一。且爲極負盛名之批評家。間亦嘗自編劇本。對於梅劇曾在報中露布評論一二段。（此人之戲劇評乃自由發表意見非爲謀利者）今日特來訪談。可知其對於中劇之注意矣。茲將其批評撮要述之如下。</p>

<p>（七）蘇州河岸旅行</p>
<p>上海的水道、除了黄浦江以外、其次就要算蘇州河了、沿河有不少的碼頭、蘇常内河一帶來往的旅客、搭小輪船或是航船來上海的、大都在天后宮橋、盆湯弄橋幾個碼頭起岸、每天早上八九點鐘、小輪船還没有開駛的時候、許多老的少的、男的女的、擠滿在碼頭上、不多一刻、汽笛呌了幾聲、氤氲的黑烟也從烟突裏直冒到岸上來、小輪船漸漸的離開河岸、向西駛去、輪船後由拖了大大小小七八隻船、首尾都接連了、很像一條長蛇、蜿延着進行、這是蘇州河裏很普遍的一種景像我們日常看報到湖匪刦小輪的事、就要想起在蘇州河岸所得到的印象、</p>
<p>蘇州河與黄浦江相比、自然差得遠了、黄浦江好像人家的大天井、門户敝達、呌人見了歡喜、蘇州河確不然、好像灶披後的夾弄、不但位局促、連種種的東西也帶着骯髒的樣子、所以黄浦江邊、儘有許多負手散步、遠眺江景的人、蘇州河岸的情况便大大的不同了、在外白渡橋和天后宮橋中間的一段、還有若干地方可以流連、足供欣賞、可是越朝西、就越不相同、到了潭子灣小沙渡一帶、就像出了都市一般、荒凉凄苦的空氣、迷漫了兩岸、尤其是廣肇山莊的一段、人烟稀少、鬼國爲鄰、</p>
<p>河岸兩傍的景像、可以劃作三個不同樣的時期我們若然拿横架河上的橋來做標準、那末外白渡橋以西、天后宮橋以東的一段、好像一個青年人、帶着活潑高興的樣子、兩岸的建築景色、處處流蕗着整齊絢爛的氣槪、天后宮橋和麥根路底舢板廠橋中間的一段、岸邊的情形最爲複雜、最爲熱鬧、河裏的船隻也最多、這種煩勞而毫無休止的情况、好像一個人在中年時期、拚命去解决他的生活問題一般、至於舢板廠橋、是蘇州河兩岸最末了的一頂橋、由此以西、便没有橋了、渡河須用渡船、兩岸的情景愈見得荒凉、好像一個年老的人、生趣也愈見得减少、在潭子灣小沙渡一帶、許多江北人住在小船上、可是這種船永遠不飄在水裏、呌牠离水登陸、靠着岸居住、這種没有生命的船、很可以代表這一段蘇州河岸的槪况、</p>
<p>第一段的蘇州河岸、包括外白渡橋、裏白渡橋四川路橋江西路橋和天后宮橋（河南路橋）外白渡橋的「白」字、恐怕是擺字的傳誤、那地方又有個名稱呌做「頭壩」、幾十年前的蘇州河是怎樣的景况、這兩個字倒也能告訴我們一點、站在橋上、向東望、黄浦江的水、就在脚底下流到蘇州河裏南面便是外灘公園、一只地角、成了兩水交界的圍墻、外白渡橋西名呌「花園橋」、外灘公園果然是很有關係的了、那橋堍下確還有一個專門蒔花的花園、站在橋上可以一覽無餘、其中一所玻璃花房、裏面幽靜異常、靠壁一個自流泉、水從上面流到潭裏、綠影倒映在上面、越顯得室内的幽靜、</p>
<p>從橋上向西望、最近的二白渡橋、二白渡橋的兩岸也很有「閒情逸緻」的點綴、靠河岸的南邊、常有燃燒汽油的遊艇、停留在河面上、船裏面收拾得像醫院裏一樣乾凈、撑船的老大們、也顯露着自尊的樣子、他們除了主人出遊的當兒、隨駕扈從以外、平日便鎭天的在船裏打掃揩擦、因之灰污塵土和他們都絶綠了、在蘇州河裏進出的船隻、有的裝載客人、有的拖帶貨物、十隻船中間終有九隻船是擁腫的、惟有遊艇、身軀瘦削、骨肉亭匀、好像是蘇州河裏的女郎、</p>
<p>白渡橋四川路橋之間、沿岸有禮拜堂醫院、旅社、電影院及花園店　　等、尤其是靠南岸裏白渡橋附近、道路平坦、景物清幽、夕陽將下的時候、江風從東面吹過來、拂在人面上、不亞於江濱散步、四川路橋北堍的郵局、是蘇州河畔唯一的重要建築物、天后宮橋的商整會、也有他相當的地位、天后宮後有改組的時候、裏面有不少的攤販和星相家、瞻神膜拜的人、也很衆多、城隍廟紅廟之外、天后宮也可以算着第三把位置、現在門前冷落、大不如前、這也是和蘇州岸有相互關係的變遷哩、</p>
<p>隔了橋看車輛行人、往來的情形、差不多是蘇州河岸特具的一種景緻、外白渡橋上面有一個鐵架子、交横錯綜、高拱在橋面上、一到夜間電車在橋面上駛過遠遠的望去、車厢裏的燈光、從空隙間透出來、很有趣味、夜裏在蘇州河岸又能望見三家百貨公司的塔尖、高　在半空中、回頭望東邊雖後有高大的東西、然而船上的燈光、反映在水裏、蕩漾而搖曳着、兩岸的空氣、似乎沉寂了許多、可是一輛摩托車、很快的從橋面上駛過、沉寂的空中、又像河水一樣的蕩動了、</p>
<h3 id="c260">三保太監在南洋　ＹＳ <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>（十）三保洞</p>
<p>這次是三保太監第七次的航海了、也就是他往南洋去的最後一次了、那時正是一四三三年的時候、他和着了他二萬多的兵民、乘了數十艘「大眼鷄」往南洋去、</p>
<p>一次、他們這數十艘「大眼鷄」正趁着風平浪靜航行的當兒、不知怎的、徒然地起了一個滔天的大浪、於是風也開始颼颶起來了、這數十艘「大眼鷄」竟搖籃似在汪洋中隨浪漂蕩着、</p>
<p>這時這幾十艘「大眼鷄」裏的兵民、通通都陷於嘔吐中了、他們嘔吐得很利害、氣力自然是一點都没有了、這時、賢能的三保太監也想不出什麽補救的方法來、他們這一羣嘔吐的可憐的兵民、這時只能「聽天由命」地倒臥在搖籃似的「大眼鷄」中了、</p>
<p>不久、浪是漸漸地浩大起來、風也漸漸地利害起來、這時、船的搖動更加利害了、翻山倒海似的搖動却令那一羣嘔吐的兵民更加劇烈的難堪起來、</p>
<p>三保太監在這時竟也嘔吐起來、他是想不出什麽方法來的了、「聽天由命」的念頭、這時也許會在他的腦裏浮現着吧、於是、他除了倒臥着之外、什麽事情在他也好像是毫無痛癢地不理眯了、</p>
<p>風浪一天一天地大了起來、這已是第三天了、還不見浪平靜下來、</p>
<p>第四天的風浪、却更來得凶猛極了、這數十艘「大眼鷄」、本來是跟在一起航行的、但是這時候早已給風浪、爲他們分散了、然而這些倒臥在「大眼鷄」裏的可憐的兵民、還絲毫不知道呢、</p>
<p>五天、三保太監忍受不住這苦了、因此他竟咒詛起來、</p>
<p>「假如還是受這麽大風浪的苦、倒不如死了爽快些呢」他的話剛剛説完、而一陣浩大的巨浪、竟把他這隻孤帆打翻了、於是、害船裏的人們、竟因此完全被淹斃、而船也慢慢地沉到海底裏云、</p>
<p>正當三保太監的船沉了後、第二天風浪竟停了下來、誰知在距離三保太監沉船的地點不遠、便有着一個個小小的荒島呢、</p>
<p>時光像電光一般地閃過、一個月很快便過去了、這時、在那個荒島的偏僻處、竟浮起了一個岩洞、那岩洞、從遠處望去、簡直是一隻翻了的船似的、岩洞上生滿了不少奇異的樹木、那些樹木却好鐵鍊似的、紊亂的垂掛着、這個岩洞呢、據説是三保太監的船、後來不知怎的竟在南方的民間裏、流傳着這一篇三保洞的傳説、</p>

<h3 id="e6">The Political Situation After the Formation of the New Cabinet in Poland <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The political situation in Poland is extremely unstable. Since the promulgation of the Constitution, the number of cabinet reshuffles is unknown. Although the new cabinet has been formed again now, and the Prime Minister has been changed to Sławek, the notorious dictator, Piłsudski, still controls the army and still wants to carry out his long-held ideas in order to achieve his unfinished goals. Therefore, the hope for political stability is still far away.</p>
<p>Before the Constitution was formulated, Piłsudski served as the head of state and was also the leader of the revolutionary party. It cannot be said that he was not one of the founding heroes of the new Poland. In 1922, the Constitution was promulgated, and Parliament was established. Piłsudski then retired. However, later, due to repeated coups, the parties in Parliament were in constant turmoil. Piłsudski could not sit idly by, and in 1926, he issued a declaration, saying that the reason for the instability of the Polish political situation was that the power of the executive branch was too weak and the power of the legislative branch was too great. In the future, reform must start with the establishment of a strong government. Therefore, he led troops straight to the Polish capital. After three days of street fighting, political power was once again in Piłsudski's hands. However, he was determined not to personally hold executive power, but rather to permanently control the army and be a dictator behind the scenes. Therefore, in subsequent parliamentary elections for executive leaders, he mostly recommended candidates. Piłsudski's control of the country's 300,000 troops began with this. However, since Piłsudski secretly exercised great power, although he tried his best to make the government strong, he still did not achieve his goal. Political turmoil continued to occur. The effectiveness of Piłsudski's policy experiment has already become obvious.</p>
<p>Although this cabinet reshuffle in Poland was caused by Parliament passing a vote of no confidence in the Minister of Labor, it is reported that there had been various speculations beforehand that Piłsudski was about to interfere in politics. It was said that he advocated suspending Parliament and forming a semi-dictatorial government. It was also said that his subordinates, Ciemieński or his brother, Jan, would come forward to form a cabinet and make demands on Parliament, such as that members of parliament must not interfere in the government's administration. Although the person who came forward to form the cabinet is Sławek, Piłsudski still holds the position of army chief. This shows that Piłsudski still wants to be a dictator behind the scenes and wants to go a step further to achieve his goal of establishing a strong government. This is already clearly visible. Currently, Italy, Germany, Austria, and other countries are all vigorously advocating the theory of strong government. Some have succeeded, some have not, but all are proceeding urgently. It cannot be said that the idea of dictatorship is not widespread in Europe. However, at a time when democratic politics is developing rapidly, to what extent this ideology can be sustained in this trend, we are really afraid to predict. Moreover, the Polish nation is known for its love of freedom, and the new forces in its political parties are also progressing daily. Whether Piłsudski's policies can proceed smoothly to achieve his goals is even less known.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The General Headquarters announced the telegram from Beiping on the 31st: (1) Lu Zhonglin led the main force of the Northwest Army to station in Luoyang, and the troops of Sun Liangcheng, Feng Chang, and Liu Fengqi are moving toward Zhengzhou, but their intentions are unclear. (2) Yan Xishan is indeed suspicious of the movements of the Northwest Army and is now transferring the main force of the Jin Army to concentrate on the line of Daming, Shunde, and Xinxiang. If Feng Yuxiang can lead his troops south, they will move to the south bank of the Yellow River. Otherwise, they will remain in their original defense and take a wait-and-see attitude. (3) The Jin Army dispatched a part to the Dezhou Yellow River bank area to contain the Central Army, but its main force seems to be still gathering in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. (4) Yan and Feng have their own selfish ideas on military plans, and it is difficult to agree. Yan advocated that the Northwest Army go directly south along the Pinghan Railway, with a part going out of northern Hubei to Xiangfan and along the Han River to jointly attack Wuhan. The Jin Army would be responsible for the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. Feng advocated that the main force of the Northwest Army, together with the Jin Army, aim at the Central Army along the Longhai Railway, and take a defensive posture in the Pinghan and northern Hubei areas. The two men's opinions are contradictory, so Yan suspects Feng even more and fears that the original plan will have to be largely changed. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Because the British Foreign Office inquired about how to handle the rescue fees when Chinese warships or non-warship national vessels provide assistance to merchant ships, the Ministry of Communications is now investigating and found that my country's measures for rescuing ships in distress are separately stipulated in Chapter 6 of the Maritime Law. Also, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has a precedent for rescuing ships in distress, and the fees charged are handled in accordance with the York and Antwerp Rules established in 1924. As for warships rescuing merchant ships, this matter falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Navy. The Navy has an obligation to rescue distressed ships. Unless otherwise stipulated by law, the Navy, the main body, and the officers and soldiers of the warship do not claim rewards. However, for non-warships that are under the jurisdiction of the Navy and are equipped with maritime rescue machinery, or are towing ships that are specially used for rescue and have a business nature, the procedures for claiming rescue rewards should be handled in accordance with the general practice of various countries. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been informed and requested to reply. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) At the memorial week of the Ministry of Military Affairs on the 31st, He Yingqin reported that last week, Yan incited Sun Dianying to rebel with troops in the Guidet and Haozhou areas of the Longhai Railway, destroying bridges, disrupting transportation, and actively taking military action. The purpose was to cut off the connection between the 3rd Route Army's General Headquarters under Han and the troops of the Jinpu Railway. Subsequently, our 2nd and 3rd Route Armies launched separate attacks and defeated the enemy at Mamuji, Guide, and other places within a week. The bandit troops of Sun's forces, apart from those killed and captured, fled in disorder towards Zhecheng and Luyi. Yan's plan to use Wei's army and bandits as a vanguard has failed in its initial stage. As for Yan himself, although he is ostensibly allied with Feng, they are in fact harboring ulterior motives. If Yan and Feng do not repent and do not take the Duan, Cao, Wu, and Sun incidents of the past, and the recent Li, Bai, Zhang, and Tang incidents as a lesson, I believe that without the Central Army launching a punitive expedition, their internal collapse is inevitable, etc. (31st Dispatch)</p>

<p>British Representative Issues Statement</p>
<p>French Representative Reads it with Obstructive Air</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Ministry Plans to Issue Instructions</p>
<p>US-Japan Understanding May Be Established</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 31st - It is reported that the Naval Conference has taken another turn. US and French experts are studying a formula to reconcile British and French opinions, but work has stalled and become a complete stalemate. It is also reported that all newspapers admit that the Naval Conference has reached a stalemate, but the Daily News claims that there is indeed some common ground between British and French views, and if they can make a slight step further, the French tonnage is expected to decrease. Otherwise, in terms of the Five-Power Understanding, the Naval Conference will inevitably fail. It is heard that all parties participating in the Naval Conference believe that it is urgent to take practical action and not delay any longer. When the plenary session opens on Friday, representatives from all countries must explain their positions to the public. Therefore, the success or failure of the Naval Conference's efforts to establish a Five-Power Agreement will be determined by discussions and negotiations in the coming days.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 30th - The Naval Conference is continuing its efforts to find a formula to bridge the gap between the ambiguous wording of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant and France's concrete demands for security. This work is very difficult, but finding an interpretation of the provisions that satisfies all parties is not entirely impossible. With this hope, discussions are proceeding. Article 16 of the Covenant is currently being closely studied. Today's development was the British Prime Minister's talk with the Italian representatives at the villa, which discussed Italy's relations in the new interpretation of the wording of Article 16 and how to find a formula. A British official spokesman stated today that Britain is extremely willing to do its best to seek peace, but any military restraint thereafter is absolutely impossible. Tonight, after the British Prime Minister returned to London from the villa, the members of the British delegation gathered on Downing Street to decide to hold a meeting of the general representatives of various countries tomorrow.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Tokyo, 31st - Instructions to the Japanese representatives at the London Naval Conference are expected to be issued tomorrow afternoon. It is widely expected that the reply will accept the conditions proposed by the US representatives with polite words, but with the following reservations: (1) Japan's acceptance of the US proposal does not imply that Japan is prepared to permanently abandon its demand for a 70% ratio of eight-inch gun cruisers. (2) Allow Japan to carry out some shipbuilding projects during the period between now and 1936, so that shipyard workers are not unemployed. This morning, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has drafted the draft instructions, which will be submitted to the Naval General Staff for review tonight. It is heard that regardless of whether the navy approves or not, the original text of the instructions will be submitted to the cabinet tomorrow. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs only needs to obtain the cabinet's approval to request the Emperor's approval, and the cabinet will surely agree to the instructions.</p>
<p>Dentsu, London, 30th - The British side's representatives issued a statement on the evening of the 30th regarding the negotiations on the British-French political agreement, saying that Britain is pouring all its efforts into all possible agreements, but cannot comply with binding treaties beyond this. If other means of achieving peace can lead to security guarantees in peacetime and wartime, Britain will be happy to comply, but cannot consider this at the moment. Britain intends to gladly advance to the maximum extent possible, but absolutely cannot comply with agreements that bind military action. This statement can be regarded as the opinion of the British Prime Minister. If France does not change its attitude, the negotiations will have to be suspended. The French plenipotentiary read this statement with an air of pessimism. He will meet with Henderson on the 31st to continue discussions. Relations between the two countries are on the verge of a crisis of imminent breakdown.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 31st - Foreign Minister Kihara visited Prime Minister Hamaguchi today to explain the inner case of the return instructions, requesting a decision to be submitted to the cabinet meeting on the 1st. This return instruction will be shown to the navy tonight at the Minister of Navy's official residence for consultation between the two ministries.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 31st - The original draft of the return instructions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was decided by the main meeting of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday and has been submitted to the navy today. The content of the case largely recognizes Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki's request for instructions, but with reservations, that is, this agreement, after the extinction at the end of 1935, should retain the auxiliary fleet power that Japan should possess after 1936, and is not subject to any restrictions on the ratio to the United States. Reserving the next meeting, you can rely on the US 70% basis and have more freedom to discuss the amount of possession. As for the form of reservation, it is up to Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki to decide how the meeting will trend.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 31st - The return instruction drafted by Foreign Minister Kihara himself will be approved at the cabinet meeting tomorrow, and then Prime Minister Hamaguchi will present it to the Emperor for approval and wired to London. Negotiations between Japan and the United States can be reopened as a result, and an understanding between Britain and Japan can also be established. In any case, a three-country agreement can be established.</p>

<p>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 30th - The German cabinet crisis was resolved within 48 hours, which is unprecedented in parliamentary history. This proves that the new prime minister has the determination and perseverance to sweep away partisan disputes with a quick cut of the Gordian knot.

<p>Guomin News Agency, Chicago, 30th - Irish Nationalist Leader Eamon de Valera told reporters today that the resignation of the President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, Cosgrave, may not mean that his party can come out and organize a new government to replace him. Because Cosgrave's party and its allies occupy too many seats, or will continue to elect Grieg and other substitutes as the head of state. However, if his party can take office during this period, then he can first announce its policies: (1) Create a unified and independent Republic of Ireland. (2) Rebuild Irish industries, replacing hundreds of millions of dollars of imports with domestic products. (3) Reserve for self-use the millions of Irish money that had been unjustifiably paid to the United Kingdom to relieve the people's suffering. (4) Restore the Irish language, etc. According to the current sixth session of the Irish Parliament, the government party occupies 61 seats, Valera's party occupies 57, independents 12, labor 13, independent labor 1, farmers 6, and the National United Party 2.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Mexican Silver Miners Plan Silver Sales Methods <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Mexico City, 30th - Silver miners here are planning methods to encourage the sale of silver to the manufacturing industry. President Gao Xi of the Mining Chamber of Commerce said today that the selling price of raw silver is only 42 cents, while the price of silver made into finished products is around $5. Under this situation, the silver mining industry can still catch up and compete with silver jewelry merchants, which can not only promote the sale of raw silver, but also profit from it. If the silver mining industry can take control of the silver jewelry manufacturing industry, it would be even better. The current silver jewelry industry cannot absorb the due amount of raw silver, which has led to a daily decline in the price of raw silver. High prices and improper sales methods are the two main reasons. The recent silver market turmoil in China and other silver-using countries is due to this. If the silver jewelry industry does not reflect on itself, the silver mining industry may soon implement its strategy.</p>

It has been found that one village accountant, 74 village chiefs and tax collectors have resigned. Among them, many have applied for reinstatement, and some who have submitted their resignations are still working. The resignations of officials are mostly due to intimidation caused by villagers refusing to provide food and water, and refusing to rent houses, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Central Government and National Government Memorial Week <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Central Party Headquarters: On the 31st at 9:00 AM, the Central Party Headquarters held the 53rd weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen in the grand auditorium. Approximately 500 to 600 people attended, including central committee members, department and bureau staff, and guests. Chairman Hu Hanmin, after the ritual bowing, gave a report, stating that the reactionary warlords' betrayal of the Party and the nation was now undeniably exposed. What was strange was that Chen Gongbo and others were busily traveling between Peiping and Taiyuan, engaging in unconscious alliances with Yan Xishan. Yan Xishan, having entrenched himself in the north for over a decade, was accustomed to the warlord tricks of past years. His mind was filled only with feudal thoughts and he did not recognize the Party's principles or revolutionary spirit. Therefore, no matter how he pretended, he would inevitably take a path of counter-revolution or non-revolution. As for Chen Gongbo and others, they had always been skilled in opportunism, sometimes being Kuomintang members, sometimes collaborating with Chen Jiongming, sometimes aligning with the Communist Party, and now, using the excuse of seeking a way out, they were cooperating with the most cunning of the warlords. At best, they were only exploiting each other to seek temporary gains. Politically, they would not have a long lifespan. The result would only be the abandonment of their character and the hastening of their downfall. Their biggest mistakes were: (1) deviating from the Party's principles and the late Premier's teachings. They completely failed to understand the late Premier's instructions on saving the country through the Party, governing the country through the Party, and building the country through the Party, as well as the revolutionary process that must go through the military and tutelage stages. They only sought a way to advance their careers, not hesitating to become traitors to the Party. (2) greatly despising the people, believing that with power in hand, they could arbitrarily oppress the masses and do whatever they pleased, with an attitude of "let others curse, I will be a good official myself." They did not know that there was true right and wrong in the universe, and true likes and dislikes in public opinion. How prominent was the Preparatory Society during Yuan Shikai's imperial ambitions, and how verbose were Wu Jinglian's arguments when Cao Kun bribed votes? But what was the result? It can be seen that anyone who violates justice and goes against the will of the people is bound to fail. At this time, Yan Xishan is using three or five people despised by the Kuomintang, as well as Duan Qirui, Feng Yuxiang, Wu Peifu, and others as puppets, hoping to become a temporary dictator himself. But Yan's abilities are far inferior to Duan, Feng, and Wu. Duan still knew that the country needed a strong government and was willing to bear considerable responsibility. Although Feng was hated by the people in the north, he was also feared by the people. Wu was brave in battle and did not want to use others. Yan, on the other hand, has not only betrayed the government but also wants to use cunning tricks to use others as his tools. This kind of behavior is not worth mentioning. Although the central government wants to reform such people, it is impossible. It can only fundamentally strengthen the Party's power, be determined to eliminate the warlords, and consolidate the foundation of the Party and the country. After the report, the meeting adjourned at 10:30 AM.</p>
<p>National Government: On the same day at 10:00 AM, the National Government held a weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. Tan Yankai, Gu Yingfen, Yi Peiji, Zhang Wohua, Liu Ruiheng, Zheng Hongnian, Zhang Nanxian, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, He Yaozu, Chen Yi, Zhou Yawei, Zhang Yuanhu, Liu Jiwen, and all staff of the National Government's civilian officials, military attachés, and adjutant offices, totaling over 200 people, attended. Chairman Tan Yankai, after the ritual bowing, had Secretary Qian Changzhao give the following political report: "[The reconstruction of Tokyo, Japan, has been completed. This reminds me of the spring of 1924 when I traveled to Japan. At that time, Tokyo had just experienced an earthquake. The roads and businesses were uneven, and the houses, except for large buildings such as the Imperial Palace and the Imperial Hotel, were mostly collapsed in the east and fallen in the west. The Japanese people suffered great sacrifices in that natural disaster, but they showed no signs of decline. Their spirit of perseverance and determination is truly admirable. I once said that their recovery period was not far away. Now, the reconstruction of Tokyo has been completed after six and a half years and costing 800 million yuan. The Japanese government and the people have a unified spirit, burying their heads in construction, silently completing unprecedented work. During this period, they encountered many difficulties, but they still proceeded according to the original plan because they were very confident. The original plan was very detailed and had already taken into account manpower and financial resources, and manpower and financial resources could be concentrated on the original plan. Today, the completion of the construction is such an honor. Japan is like this, and our country should work hard. Recently, the world's material construction, those with sufficient manpower and financial resources, and using large knives and axes to construct, are the United States. Those with considerable manpower and financial resources, and extremely cautious and orderly, are the United Kingdom. Those without sufficient manpower and financial resources, but using a spirit of perseverance and determination to construct, are Japan and Germany. The construction of the United States has</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>sometimes bordered on wastefulness, the construction of the United Kingdom has been too cautious, and the construction of Japan and Germany is the most worthy of emulation. This time, Japan's reconstruction of its capital is a good example. Although Germany was restricted everywhere after the war, it returned to its pre-war state in less than ten years, which is also unattainable. Our country's manpower and financial resources are still far inferior to those of Japan and Germany. Only by emulating their spirit of perseverance and determination can we hope for the future of construction. The importance of Hulunbuir is not well known to the general public. The area is vast and sparsely populated, and industries such as agriculture, mining, forestry, and animal husbandry have not yet been developed. As long as we find ways to improve them, economic progress will surely be rapid. Previously, the central government and Hulunbuir were very estranged, and imperialists took the opportunity to entice and instigate. Recently, the central government has paid special attention, and Hulunbuir has also sent representatives to Beijing. In the future, border worries can be reduced. Nepal's dispatch of troops into Tibet has a great impact on our country. The central government has decided on countermeasures, which are not convenient to announce at the moment. In short, the central government is very cautious about this matter, striving to resolve the dispute and consolidate the border. However, I have one feeling, that is, we are too unclear about the border situation. When incidents occur, not only is the truth difficult to discern, but there is also very little reference material. However, imperialists have various preparations, eyeing us covetously. How dangerous this is! This year's Mongolian and Tibetan Conference hopes to finalize the major policies. At the same time, I also hope that people with ambition will launch a movement and go to Mongolia and Tibet in teams. Yan Feng's rebellion, sometimes wanting to take the false post of commander-in-chief, sometimes wanting to organize a false government in Peiping, is driven by greed and acting in a rush, without a definite plan. In short, the more tricks they play in their rebellion, the faster their defeat. Now Yan Feng is facing economic difficulties, lacking pay and ammunition. Although some say that foreign banks are willing to lend them money, this news is not necessarily true, because if it is true, then foreign banks are truly foolish beyond comparison, because this kind of loan will never be repaid in principal and interest, and the only cost is the resentment of our people. As for the central government's response to this rebellion, everything is prepared, but because this is the key to the success of the revolution, the attitude taken is particularly steady. The people should not panic, and various rumors should not be easily believed."</p>
<h3 id="e74">Detailed Account of Chairman Chiang's Visit to Hangzhou from Ningbo <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>To Deliver a Speech at the Provincial Party Headquarters' Memorial Week</p>
<p>National Government Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, accompanied by his wife Madame Soong Mei-ling, Vice Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan, and others, took the Chu Tai warship from Nanjing via Shanghai back to his ancestral home in Fenghua on the 21st. It was originally scheduled to come to Hangzhou on the 26th. Zhejiang Provincial Government Chairman Zhang Jingjiang, Civil Affairs Commissioner Zhu Jiahua, Education Commissioner Chen Bulei, Secretary-General Shen Shiyuan, and others all went to Fenghua to welcome him. Later, the provincial government received a telegram from Fenghua, saying that Chairman Chiang would leave Fenghua for Hangzhou on the morning of the 30th. The military and police were immediately ordered to protect the route in sections. The Xixing section was the responsibility of the 1st Regiment of the Infantry Training Corps. The Jianggan section was the responsibility of Brigade Commander Liu, Regiment Commander Lai, Police Chief Li, and others, who personally led the 3rd Regiment of the Security Team, the Cavalry Patrol Team, the Provincial Police Brigade, the 1st District Team of the Water Police, and the police of the Hangzhou County Public Security Bureau, providing thorough protection.</p>
<p>Yesterday (30th) at 1:00 PM, party and government figures from all walks of life in the provincial capital arrived at Jianggan to welcome him. Those who arrived included Provincial Government Chairman Zhang Jingjiang, Madame Zhang, and their sons and daughters, Civil Affairs Commissioner Zhu Jiahua, Education Commissioner Chen Bulei, Provincial Government Secretary-General Shen Shiyuan, Provincial Party Headquarters Executive Committee members Ye Suzhong, Xu Shaodi, Chen Xihui, Zhang Qiang, Yang Yunfang, Qing Ru, Provincial Party Headquarters Supervisory Committee member Hu Jianzhong, Construction Department Secretary Chief Huo Baoshu, Security Office Chief Zhu Siming, Mayor Zhou Xiangxian, Tobacco Tax Bureau Chief Liu Hao, and Lai Gang, Shen Chang, and others, totaling over one hundred people.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang and his party departed from Xikou by car at 8:00 AM yesterday morning and arrived in Ningbo at 9:20 AM. They briefly rested at the Chiang Supervising Office. At 10:10 AM, they took the prepared decorated cars from Ningbo to Cao'e, where they had lunch in the car. They stopped at the Wufu station for ten minutes to inspect the 4th Regiment of the 1st Brigade of the Central Infantry Training Corps. At 11:30 AM, they arrived at Baiguan and immediately crossed the Cao'e River. At 2:00 PM, they took the No. 105 car provided by the Highway Bureau from Wuyun and arrived at the Xixing riverbank at 3:40 PM. The car drove directly onto the ship at the dock. At that time, Xiaoshan County Magistrate Du and Provincial Highway Bureau Chief Chen Ticheng were also on board waiting. At 3:45 PM, when Chairman Chiang's car arrived directly at the dock ship, it was raining heavily. Chiang and his wife Soong Mei-ling got out of the car and nodded to the welcomers one by one, then immediately boarded the ship. There were two tugboats prepared by the provincial government, one for Chairman Chiang and one for his entourage. At 4:17 PM, the tugboat was towed to the riverbank by the Yi He warship. At that time, the welcomers were all standing by the ship in the rain. First, Provincial Government Secretary-General Shen stepped forward to salute, and the important figures all came forward to pay their respects. Chiang and Madame Soong nodded in return, then immediately took the car prepared by the provincial government, accompanied by Adjutant Wang Shiyu, and drove directly to Chiang Villa. The military and police along the way held their guns in salute. No fewer than sixty or seventy welcoming cars also went to Chiang Villa in West Lake. Those who came with Chairman Chiang, in addition to his wife Madame Soong, included German advisor Fischen, Naval Vice Minister Chen Shaokuan, Secretary Gao Lingbai, Rong Baofeng, Mao Qingxiang, Zhang Jiaoyuzhang Zhizhong, Song Zi'an, and Guard Captain Jiang Fushou. It was reported that after arriving in Hangzhou, he would immediately inspect the 155th Brigade stationed in Hangzhou and the various units of the 1st Brigade of the Central Military Officers' Training Corps, but due to the rain, the inspection was changed to start this morning. According to Naval Acting Minister Chen, Chiang also plans to attend the opening ceremony of the National Games tomorrow (1st), and then return to Nanjing. Today (31st) at 9:00 AM, the Provincial Party Headquarters and the Provincial Government held a joint memorial week in the Party Headquarters auditorium. Chairman Chiang also attended and participated. After the ritual bowing, Chairman Chiang gave the following speech: "Comrades, I have made some contributions to the party and government of this province. I will take this opportunity to speak during today's memorial week. Speaking of the party and government of this province, in any aspect, it is more advanced than other provinces. This is all due to the efforts of everyone, which have resulted in the good results of this model province. I also share in the glory. Regarding party affairs, the work of the Provincial Party Headquarters has been very good. The organization of the county party headquarters and sub-branches is also quite sound. I have not been to Zhejiang for a year. In this year, material construction has been quite remarkable, which is very gratifying. However, these good things are our responsibilities, and there is no need for much praise. Regarding the political aspect, Zhejiang has focused on local autonomy and implemented the village-li system and the baojia law for the past year. This was originally an important task during the period of political tutelage. The land declaration is also an important event in local autonomy and is the first step in land survey. When implementing a new policy for the first time, the public's suspicion is unavoidable. The handling of the land declaration in Zhejiang this time has generally been without problems. However, the registration fee of seven copper coins for one house is unprecedented in Chinese history. The registration fee for one or two fen of land is the same as for one mu of land, which makes the people feel quite painful. There is no difference between people with one or two mu of land and those with ten or one hundred mu of land. The people think it is a bit unfair. The government should pay attention to this and study a way to improve it. Secondly, according to what I know, the lijia heads of the village-li system in Zhejiang do not actually do anything, they are nominally existent. In the future, we should find ways to make them live up to their names and should be helped by the county party headquarters and sub-branches, using passive means to achieve active purposes. We must not use very strong force to interfere with the environment, but must use good intentions to persuade. For the evil forces in the locality, as long as they do not oppress the poor and do not monopolize lawsuits, it is not necessary to eliminate them completely, making them unable to exist. When doing things, one must know when to stop. In addition, regarding the current situation, I can also briefly report a few points. The barriers between revolution and counter-revolution are becoming clearer day by day. In the past, corrupt and deteriorating elements, wearing the mask of revolution, were mixed in with our party. Who is</p>
<p>a comrade and who is an enemy, we could not distinguish clearly. Now that their true colors are gradually being exposed, the future of the revolution is brighter. I often say that the more obvious the reactionary forces are, the faster the revolution will succeed, and the more confident we will be. This is not boasting. I heard that Yan Xishan is scheduled to take the false post of Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army tomorrow. Yan's purpose this time is to use all factions to eliminate the Kuomintang. It is a pity that the Reorganization Faction has not yet realized this. We are desperate for the leaders of the Reorganization Faction to be obsessed with confusion, but for the young people of the Reorganization Faction, we should warn them, so that they can still maintain their position and history in the revolution. Now the other side is uniting all reactionary forces to rise up in chaos. The content is very complex. Now the government is still adhering to the principle of peace and using very simple forces to deal with them, so it is very optimistic about the situation, and it is expected that the country will be truly unified by the end of this year and they will definitely be eliminated. The opening of the National Games tomorrow is the first grand event since the Chinese Revolution. It is very meaningful. It not only exercises the national physique, but also promotes the national spirit. Zhejiang held a West Lake Expo last year, and this year it is holding the National Games. If there is a chance to participate tomorrow, I have a proposal, which is to promote domestic goods. During the conference, we should focus on sports and promote domestic goods, which is of great benefit to the future of our country. I hope you will help me complete this grand event."</p>

<p>General Headquarters Moves to Jining</p>
<p>The Third Route Army Garrisons Western Shandong</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Han Fuju, under orders from the Central Government, is proceeding with the planned transfer of the Third Route Army to Western Shandong. The General Headquarters is being moved to Jining. Mr. Han himself, along with staff from the General Headquarters and some personnel from the Provincial Government, departed eastward by special train on the morning of the 29th. There were slight delays along the way at Lanfeng, Neihuang, and Liuhe. In the evening, the railway reported that Han's train was about to arrive in Xuzhou. Liu Zhi, as well as Xu Tingyao, acting commander of the 1st Division, Chief of Staff Liu Yaoyang, Qian Zongze, director of the Longhai Railway Bureau, Huang Cishan, the county magistrate, Qiao Shizhao, the head of the Public Security Bureau, and Han's wife, all went to the station to welcome him. At 11:10 PM, Han's special train entered the station, accompanied by a loud military band. After the train stopped, Han alighted first and shook hands and exchanged pleasantries with Liu Zhi and the welcoming party. At that time, Han told reporters that he had come east under orders, the General Headquarters had arrived with the train, the troops were still gathering in eastern Henan, and there were no troops from his command west of Bian. He himself planned to stay in Xuzhou for a day, to consult with Commander Liu and to request instructions from the Commander, before determining his next course of action. He also said that some of the Provincial Government personnel remained in the province to maintain order. There was still a small remnant of Sun Dianying's troops in Guide. He had not formally attacked them, in order to avoid harming the people. Han then borrowed Liu Zhi's car and entered the city, and the welcomers dispersed. Han lodged at the Huayuan Hotel that evening. Those who came with Han in the same train included Li Zongbi, Chief of Staff of the General Headquarters, Zhang Shaotang, Secretary, Li Shuchun, Commissioner of the Civil Affairs of the Provincial Government, Wang Xiangrong, Commissioner of the Finance of the Provincial Government, and others. There were about thirty cars in total, fully loaded with guards, vehicles, equipment, and other items. Hai Tao, who had traveled from Nanjing to Bian under Chiang's orders to see Han, had also arrived in Xuzhou before Han. Hai told reporters that he and Commander Han had left Bian for Xuzhou one after the other. Han would be going to Jining within days, and he himself, because Ma Hongkui was in command, had gone to Jinan, and would be going to Jinan from Xuzhou within days to meet with Ma before returning to Nanjing to report back.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 30th, the reporter visited Li Zongbi on the train and asked Mr. Li to talk about the following: the retreat of the headquarters to the east under orders was a planned project. Since the conflict between the headquarters and the Wan Xuancai's troops in Zhongmu, Wan had sent a representative to Bian, but it seemed that his intention was to spy on the situation rather than to explain the misunderstanding. The headquarters had been retreating eastward since the day before yesterday (28th) and had completely left Bian by yesterday (29th). Before leaving Bian, it was learned that a brigade of cavalry from the Northwest Army had arrived at the Wan Xuancai Division at the forefront of Zheng, and it had now reached Bian. The army concentrated in eastern Henan and the Second Route Army in western Xu had joined the defense line. The equipment and troops transported by train in the headquarters consisted of a total of ten trains, all of which arrived in Xuzhou with the Commander's train and were successively transferred to western Shandong. The Commander would also transfer to Jining. The reporter asked about Shi Yousan's recent attitude. Li said that Mr. Shi did not seem to understand the doctrine very well, but he had not made any overt expressions. At that time, the trains that had arrived in Xuzhou with Han had already headed north one after another.</p>
<p>Commander Liu, taking advantage of Han's visit to Xuzhou, arranged a banquet on the evening of the 30th to welcome Han. All the senior generals and provincial commissioners who came with Han were invited. The banquet was very lively. Han's special train was scheduled to depart northward that evening. It was reported that the Third Route Army and the Fifteenth Route Army would form a joint defense in western Shandong. As for the western section of the route, Han said that there was not much damage and there were no major changes in the military situation. After shortening the defense line, the strength would be more concentrated. The rebel army could be wiped out in one fell swoop by tilting its nest. (30th)</p>

<p>Provincial Party Headquarters Asks Central Government for Troops to Suppress Bandits</p>
<p>Nanchang correspondence on the 29th: Fenyi is located in western Jiangxi, between Xinyu, Anfu, Yichun, and Wanzai. After Anfu and Wanzai successively sounded the alarm, the county was also in imminent danger. At dawn on March 20, about 1,000 troops under Peng Dehuai, with 700-800 guns and 4 machine guns, entered the county seat. At that time, there was only one company of troops stationed in the city. Due to the disparity in numbers, the city fell to the bandits at 11:00 AM, and the order was in great chaos. All the county government officials disguised themselves and fled to Xinyu and sent a telegram to the province asking for help. After receiving the telegram, the provincial government specially dispatched Deng Ying's independent 16th Brigade from Xiajiang and Xinyu to suppress the bandits. The 2nd and 4th regiments of the brigade arrived in Fenyi on the 22nd. Peng's bandits personally led their troops to resist, and the fighting was fierce. Deng's troops bravely suppressed them and recaptured the county seat the next day. It was heard that Peng's bandits had the potential to flee from Binjiang and harass Yichun. In addition to sending troops to pursue them, Brigade Commander Deng also telegraphed the 1st Regiment in Anfu to open up to Yichun to block them. The provincial party headquarters believes that the province is adjacent to six provinces, and the relationship with the southeast is very important for security. Recently, bandits and communists have been rampant, and they have repeatedly fallen into cities. Countless people have died and been injured. However, the number of troops stationed in the province is limited, and it is difficult to take care of both. Therefore, at the fourth regular meeting on the 28th, it was decided to appoint Liu and Zou as members to go to Beijing to petition the central government to dispatch capable troops to Jiangxi to suppress the bandits. As for the provincial government, it regards bandit suppression as the only way out for the province. Therefore, the expenses of various agencies are planned to be reduced for the purpose of bandit suppression. At the same time, because the establishment of four guard regiments and the construction of shallow-water warships are urgently needed, the Finance Department has issued 1 million yuan of circulating notes to relieve the current emergency.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Xiang Communist Leader Ye Kui Arrested and Executed <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Changsha correspondence on the 27th: Ye Kui, the leader of the communist riots in Changsha, who gathered thousands of people in Lushanzhen across the river and burned and killed for two years, had a reward of 2,000 yuan put on his head by Zhou Lan, Cheng Qian, Lu Di, and others when they presided over the Xiang government, but he had never been captured because of his numerous party members and good information. Recently, because the communists had been active in the two lakes again, and He Long had invaded Ouchi from western Hubei, looking to attack Changli, Ye Kui was ordered by the party center to be responsible for launching riots in Nanhua, Lianan, and other counties to respond to He Long. Ye then went to the Nanhua area to make arrangements and was then detected by Ding Duo, the commander of the temporary bandit suppression in Lushanzhen, Changsha. The first team leader Zheng Shuchen was immediately dispatched with 20 soldiers, each carrying a pistol, disguised as plainclothes, and rushed to Fuxingyuan in Huarong County that night to find Ye was gathering party members at Daximiao to hold a meeting. Team Leader Zheng reported to the Nanhua County Defense Bureau, which dispatched a team of soldiers to rush to the temple in the rain at 10 p.m. on the 12th and surrounded the temple, but it was too early, and the party members had not yet arrived, so only Ye Kui and Ye's secretary-general Yi Shunding, and party members Ren Man, Wang Mazi, Liu Dai three, and five others were captured. When He Jian was informed, in addition to immediately awarding a reward of 2,000 yuan, he ordered Ye Kui and Yi Shunding to be escorted to the province for interrogation, and they were sent to the province on the 20th and handed over to the Qingxiang Command Headquarters, which interrogated them four times in succession. According to Ye's confession, he was ordered by the Communist Party Central Committee, and he and He Long were responsible for disturbing Xiang and Hubei and coordinating with the Jiangxi Red Army to cause chaos in the Yangtze River area. He Jian, because Ye Kui had a few thousand party members lurking in the Changtan area, repeatedly induced him to confess the location of the hidden guns, but Ye refused to say anything. He ordered that Ye and Yi be tied to Liuyangmen outside the city and beheaded at 3 p.m. on the 26th. The heads were placed in wooden cages and taken to Lushan Town to be shown to the public. On that day, the crowd who went to the execution ground to watch was so large that it was congested. The Qingxiang Command Headquarters announced Ye Yi's crimes as follows: "For the announcement of the crimes, Ye Kui, the leader of the Communist Party, is a native of Lushanzhen, Changsha. He used to be the deputy chairman of the district agricultural association and was introduced by the chairman Yi Ziyi to join the Communist Party Xipi. His work was outstanding. After May and the Communist Kui Yi Lirong Teng Daiyuan incited him to organize a false peasant-worker revolutionary army, commanding bandits, destroying group offices, and carrying out burning and killing, plundering the Hexi area, and the disaster was extremely tragic. The Hunan Provincial Government offered a reward of 2,000 yuan for his arrest and the headquarters issued an arrest warrant, ordering the Changsha County Government to select teams and strictly arrest him without distinction. According to the county's teams and the Nanhua County teams, the bandit was arrested in Fuxingyuan in Huarong County. At the same time, Yi Shunding, the former pseudo secretary-general of the army and now the secretary of the special committee, and his accomplices Liu Zaisan and others, who conspired with the bandit Ye Kui to launch riots in Nanhua and Feng'an, were arrested. According to the county's orders, the bandit Ye Kui and Yi Shunding were presented to the department in advance. All the facts of the crime and the communist conspiracy to enter Changli from the border of Xiang and peep into Yue and E were confessed in court. In this way, the chief culprit was arrested, and the crime was unforgivable. He should be sentenced to death according to law to show a warning. In addition to signing and extracting the criminals Ye Kui and Yi Shunding, verifying their identity, tying them to the execution ground, and carrying out the death penalty, it is necessary to announce the crimes so that the public can know about it."</p>
<h3 id="e78">East Railway Solves Long-Standing Issues Meeting <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Harbin dispatch on the 24th: The East Railway Board of Directors originally scheduled a joint meeting of directors and supervisors for 1:00 PM today. However, the Russian side claimed that the agenda was not adequately prepared and requested a one-day postponement. The meeting was rescheduled to 2:00 PM on the 25th with the agreement of the Chinese directors and supervisors. The Russian side's proposals for this meeting are mostly routine matters, while the Chinese side has approximately five items: (1) The concurrent use of Chinese and Russian languages in all railway agencies; (2) Demanding the return of detained carriages from the Ukrainian Railway; (3) Joint signing of official documents by Chinese and Russian heads of bureaus and departments; (4) Establishing a translation office within the Railway Bureau for translating documents between the two sides. The remaining item reportedly concerns budget issues. The two sides previously exchanged informal opinions several days ago. The Russian directors and supervisors expressed agreement with the Chinese proposals. It is expected that this meeting will not involve much dispute. Regarding the concurrent use of Chinese and Russian languages, the Chinese proposal explains that the predominance of Russian in the various departments of the Beijing Railway often causes difficulties in handling affairs. Furthermore, differences in language often lead to errors due to improper translation. In the future, every official document should have both a Chinese and Russian version, with each referencing the other's meaning. Chinese and Russian heads of bureaus and departments should jointly sign each document upon its promulgation. A separate translation office should be established under the Railway Bureau to handle this matter. Regarding the return of carriages detained by the Ukrainian Railway, the explanation states that after the Sino-Russian split, the Ukrainian Railway detained over 400 East Railway freight cars, 17 passenger cars, and 7 flatcars. As the East Railway is currently experiencing a period of booming transport, it is appropriate to return these carriages promptly. The other proposals also have attached explanations. However, even if the concurrent use of Chinese and Russian languages is passed by the Board of Directors, its implementation must still wait, partly because it is difficult to find translators in a short time, and partly because the railway budget must increase by at least 150,000 rubles per year.</p>
<p>Dispatch on the 26th: The East Railway Board of Directors meeting was successfully concluded yesterday afternoon. The proposals from both sides had been exchanged and read beforehand, and both sides agreed with each other, so the passage was quite easy. The important cases proposed by our side and passed by resolution include: (1) Concurrent use of Chinese and Russian languages, ordering the Railway Bureau to actively prepare and implement it in the shortest possible time, with Russian as the primary language and Chinese as the secondary language; (2) The name of the Central Library is inappropriate and should be changed to the China Eastern Railway Staff Library, and the scope should be reduced; (3) Various business institutions affiliated to the Railway Bureau should be merged and abolished in consideration of their wide range, and a committee should be organized immediately to review and implement commercialization; (4) The observation system is a matter within the scope of Chinese internal affairs and should be abolished immediately; (5) All Russian-detained vehicles after last year's incident should be ordered to be returned by the Railway Bureau immediately. The resolutions passed by the Russian side include: (1) Transferring Wang Zupei, Deputy Director of the Audit Bureau, to the Director of the General Affairs Office of the Board of Directors, and Zhang Mingzhe, Director of the General Affairs Office of the Railway Bureau, to Deputy Director of the Audit Bureau; (2) Replacing the Russian Chief Director Ge Jieer, and promoting Director Izmailov to fill the vacancy; (3) Due to the sharp rise in gold prices, formulating adjustment measures for railway freight and changing the exchange rate of Harbin silver dollars; (4) Extending the lease of the Gezhde East Railway Hotel for three years, until 1934.</p>

The district office sent people to the city to ask the county government to quickly dispatch a team for support.</p>

<p>Telegram Requesting Troops to Nantong to Suppress Bandits: Zhang Jiarui, the Huaiyun envoy, reported that Yuan Desheng, the chief of the Tongzhou General Salt Field, said in his fast mail that bandits are rampant in the lower river area, disrupting the people and salt workers of the fields, and even kidnapping people for ransom, requesting that he transfer the matter to the Salt Office to dispatch troops to severely suppress them. Yesterday (the 28th), in addition to approving the transfer to the Salt Office, requesting the dispatch of troops to jointly suppress the bandits with the Provincial Public Security Bureau brigade in order to eliminate them, he also ordered the field offices to direct the land and water anti-smuggling camps stationed in various places to block and suppress them as appropriate.</p>

<p>Appeal Prisoner Escapes by Jumping from Train: A county Public Security Bureau inspection officer at Jiaxing Station seized a large sum of banknotes from a passenger named Wang Ziming last month, including a word strip indicating the sale of opium, suspecting him of selling opium. The county bureau sent him to court for interrogation. As a result, Wang Ziming was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment and fined. Wang filed an appeal against the verdict, so the police were dispatched to escort him to the Hangzhou Higher Court a few days ago. When the train passed Linping, Wang jumped from the train and escaped. The bailiff was unable to pursue him and also fled after arriving in Hangzhou.</p>

<p>Defeated Bandits Scatter and Loot: The large gang of bandits in Lexiang was bravely and painfully suppressed by the provincial security team, and the bandits were scattered. A few days ago, two small leaders were captured and beheaded by the Jiangsu Water Police. The bandits then scattered in the countryside, looting everywhere. It is estimated that on the night of the 23rd, eight houses were looted in a row in Leyiqiehe Tangjiaqiaobei, Yaqian, Lexiang. On the night of the 24th, three or four houses were looted in the countryside at Qiqandi. On the night of the 25th, Zhang Fusheng's house in Nanfanggang was robbed. On the night of the 26th, Zhang Jinsheng's house near Yaqian was also robbed, causing considerable losses.</p>

<p>Kidnapper Captured Twice: Gao Meisheng, a notorious ruffian in Nanyang, Dongxiang, Xiaoshan, colluded with kidnappers to abduct his nephew Wang (from Toupeng) in 1926 and demand a ransom. He was captured by the county government and sentenced to 13 years of imprisonment. Later, a lawyer appeared on the scene to appeal on his behalf, reducing the sentence to 10 years. He was released on bail in January of this year. However, the case still required 600 yuan. Gao, being cunning by nature, ignored it after being released. Therefore, he was reported this time and arrested repeatedly. Gao had already heard the news and absconded to avoid arrest. On the 27th, Gao came to the city for some reason and was spotted by a bailiff from the county court, who captured him and escorted him to the court.</p>
<p>Incense Boat Robbed En Route: On the night of the 29th, two incense boats sailing from Shaoxing to the Laoyue Temple in Xiaoshan were suddenly stopped by three bandit ships with more than ten bandits near Qianqing and Yangfanqiao. The bandits boarded the ship and robbed all the pilgrims of their gold and silver jewelry, cotton quilts, and clothes, worth three or four hundred gold in total. They also cut the boatman Miao Kui in two places on his leg.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Sensational Opening of National Games <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Opening Ceremony Held at 9:00 AM This Morning</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang to Attend and Deliver Speech</p>
<p>Competitions Begin and Continue for Ten Days</p>
<p>Two Thousand Athletes Display Their Skills</p>
<p>The sensational National Games will open at the Donggaoqiao Daying venue in Hangzhou at 9:00 AM this morning. The venue's magnificent architecture and complete layout are unprecedented in our country. Chairman Chiang of the National Government will attend the ceremony and deliver a training speech. The president and vice presidents, represented by Shi Weihuan, Zhu Jiahua, the director of the preparatory committee, Zhou Xiangxian and Huang Mingdao, the deputy directors, and committee members of various departments and staff members of various groups, are scheduled to attend the meeting at 7:00 AM this morning. Representatives from various agencies and organizations, as well as school military police guests, are expected to number tens of thousands. The situation yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e94">Introduction (Chong Gan) <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The grand and magnificent National Games have opened in Hangzhou today. Two thousand of the nation's outstanding male and female athletes have gathered on the shores of West Lake, each showcasing their fine skills. This is truly an unprecedented grand event. Who dares say that our nation lacks a spirit of martial valor?</p>
<p>The purpose of holding the Games is to promote national physical education. It coincides with the Ninth Far Eastern Games, to be held in Japan in May of this year. This is an opportunity to select outstanding performers to attend the Games in Japan, to win glory for our country.</p>
<p>This Games has many unique features. Here are a few points:</p>
<p>1. The Games are being held based on a government resolution, and various provinces and cities have followed suit, first holding preliminary rounds. The public enthusiastically participated, selecting representatives to compete in Hangzhou. This demonstrates the spirit of cooperation among the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>2. In the past, athletes were all students, with participation lacking from government, business, and industrial circles. Recently, there has been considerable effort to promote amateur sports. Those participating in the Games include people from all walks of life. This demonstrates the popularization of sports nationwide.</p>
<p>3. In our country, women have traditionally been considered beautiful for being delicate and refined, and not venturing far from home was the norm. But now, a generation of robust, short-clothed, leg-revealing, and athletically beautiful women are gallantly racing on the sports field. Even from the remote Northeast and Southwest, they have not shied away from the arduous journey, all coming to compete. This shows that physical education in our country has become widespread among women.</p>
<p>In addition, the reporter feels compelled to say a few words to those in charge and to the athletes, on three points:</p>
<p>1. The Games have sufficient talent and are well-funded. The preparatory procedures have been meticulously organized. The competitions will commence today and are certain to proceed smoothly. However, this grand event must not be a fleeting moment of glory. Once the competitions are over, it should not be relegated to the past. It is hoped that our leaders will allocate dedicated funds annually to promote national public physical education. Taking advantage of this gathering of physical education experts, they should plan appropriate methods for promoting physical education, to strengthen the foundation of our nation. How can this be neglected?</p>
<p>2. Athletes participating in the competitions should certainly strive for top rankings and excellent results. However, they should also embrace a spirit of "benevolence and chivalry," adhere to the rules of sportsmanship, and obey the referees' decisions. Better to lose a championship than to compromise morality.</p>
<p>3. Those participating in this Games all possess considerable ability and physical strength, and have had more opportunities to train with foreigners. They have a relatively strong chance of winning. However, they must not become arrogant because of this. Those athletes with lesser results may be that way due to their physical condition or lack of training opportunities. They should not be discouraged. The purpose of holding the Games is to promote physical education. Trophies are merely objects of encouragement. Being able to participate in the Games already makes one an athletic champion. This newspaper is dedicated to promoting physical education and will spare no effort. This National</p>
<p>Games should be extensively publicized. We wish the Games success and offer our humble contributions, hoping they will be accepted by all involved in the Games.</p>
<h3 id="e95">The Significance of the Games (Zhu Jia-hua) <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>In this season of bright spring colors, the National Games, which have been prepared for months, have finally opened on the splendid shores of West Lake. What a joyful and heartening event!</p>
<p>Our country has long been ridiculed by the great powers as the "Sick Man of East Asia." This is undeniable. Just look at how few of our country's youth are not thin and weak, barely able to support their clothes. If the youth are like this, there is no need to mention the others. If we were to compare our country's citizens with those of the great powers, we would immediately feel "inferior." The great powers call us sick men, which is indeed a form of mockery, but it also provides us with valuable criticism. We should know that to have a sound mind, we must first have a sound body. Only by uniting millions of citizens with sound bodies can we create a healthy nation. Only a healthy nation can create a healthy culture. The Chinese nation is inherently a nation rich in creative spirit. However, the weakness of the scholarly style has persisted through the ages, causing the nation's physical education to decline day by day. This has affected the spirit of the entire nation, leading to a state of complacency, and the inherent creative abilities have been almost completely lost. In recent years, due to contact with other</p>
<h3 id="e96">Important Officials of the Games <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>

<p>strong and healthy nations, and the pressure they have exerted, we have come to realize the reasons for our country's weakness. The most significant reason is the weakness of the national physique. Therefore, the issue of physical education has gradually attracted the attention of the Chinese people. In the newspapers of commercial cities, we can see news about sports competitions every day. As for the National Games, it has been held two or three times in the past. Now, the public's interest in physical education and sports is growing continuously. Therefore, this Games will certainly exert a more profound and extensive significance than the previous ones.</p>
<p>We believe that the first point worth recognizing about the significance of this Games is that it was decided by the central government. The central government's decision to hold this Games has two meanings. First, the targets of the domestic revolution, the warlords, have now been almost completely destroyed by the revolutionary forces. From now on, the direction of the revolution must shift outwards. In other words, we must implement the task of overthrowing imperialism. However, the defenses of imperialism are deep and strong, not as easily destroyed as the domestic warlords. To overthrow imperialism, we must have adequate preparation. Otherwise, even if we shout slogans of overthrowing imperialism every day, it will be useless. Setting aside other matters, let's first talk about the physique of our citizens. If we are all like sick men, struggling to even lift a gun with both hands, then trying to resist the warriors of the great powers with these sick men would be truly overestimating ourselves. Therefore, to overthrow imperialism, we must start by strengthening the physique of our citizens. Second, we have now reached the most important stage of the period of political tutelage, which is construction. However, after a society or country has undergone significant destruction, rebuilding a new society or country is an arduous task. This arduous task cannot be shouldered by a declining nation. Therefore, all Chinese citizens should know that we must strive for "revolution" and strive for physical education, strive for "construction" and strive for physical education.</p>
<p>The second point worth noting is the method of selecting athletes for this Games, which is different from previous years. In the past, the method of producing athletes from the East China, South China, North China, West China, and Central China regional games was used. This time, provinces, special municipalities, and overseas Chinese groups are used as units. The reason for changing to this method is to enable all athletes in the country, under the leadership and encouragement of the government, to be generally mobilized. We believe that in this meeting, many new athletes from various places will definitely be discovered, and they will create surprising records. We also hope that everyone will follow suit and that people's sports meets, amateur sports meets, etc., will be held continuously.</p>
<p>In the past, general athletes had a kind of mistaken idea, which was "to engage in sports for the sake of sports" or "to engage in sports for the sake of trophies." Saying "to engage in sports for the sake of sports" is as meaningless as saying "to eat for the sake of eating, to read for the sake of reading." Saying "to engage in sports for the sake of trophies" is even more ridiculous, just like saying "to read for the sake of exams, to read for the sake of a graduation diploma." The purpose of sports, to put it narrowly, is to seek the development of individual physical education. However, individuals cannot exist apart from society, so further, in addition to seeking the development of individual physical education, we must also seek the development of the physical education of the entire society. We hope that the athletes who come to this meeting can completely break the mistaken ideas of the past and understand that the purpose of this meeting is to develop national physical education and invigorate the spirit of the nation.</p>
<h3 id="e97">A Brief History of the National Games <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The National Games was founded in the second year of the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty. More than twenty years have passed since then, and three Games have been held successively. The first Games was held in the second year of Xuantong (1911 AD) in the Nanyang Industrial Exposition in Nanjing. The second Games was held in the third year of the Republic of China, that is, 1914 AD, in the Temple of Heaven in Beijing. The participating teams, sports events, and scoring methods of these two Games were not in accordance with legal regulations. Even the officials in the Games were mostly Westerners. At that time, there were still few Chinese people engaged in physical education, and their knowledge and experience were limited. The facilities and preparations for the Games had to rely heavily on Westerners. It was not until the third Games was held in Wuchang in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China that there was a formal organization. All rules were in accordance with those stipulated by the Far Eastern Games. Therefore, the formal National Games should begin with the third Games. Before the seventh and eighth Far Eastern Games, our country held national preliminary rounds to select representatives to attend the Games. The scale was grand and the event was extremely prosperous. However, there were only three officially named National Games.</p>
<p>The National Sports Advancement Association's board of directors decided two years ago to hold the fourth National Games in Guangzhou in October of last year. At the same time, the Zhejiang Provincial Government also initiated the National Games. Therefore, the Games in Guangzhou last year was canceled, and today's grand meeting in West Lake was held.</p>
<h3 id="e98">The Process of Preparation <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The National Games has been prevalent in European and American countries for more than just a day or two. In our country, due to political instability and frequent unrest, there has been no time for this great plan. This is deeply regrettable. Since the establishment of our National Government, construction has been the most urgent task. Because of the stagnation of industry, the West Lake Exposition was created to promote industry and commerce. After four months, the results were remarkable. Furthermore, because the prosperity and decline of national undertakings are always tied to the growth and decline of talent, in order to promote national physical education and promote the spirit of the nation, the National Games is being held.</p>
<h3 id="e99">(1) Appointment of Officials <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The National Games was produced based on the decision passed by the 197th meeting of the Central Political Conference. It was decided to be held in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, starting on April 1, 19. At the same time, Chiang Chung-cheng, Chairman of the National Government, was appointed as Honorary Chairman of the Games, Dai Chuanxian as Chairman, Zhang Renjie and He Yingqin as Vice Chairmen, and Zhu Jiahua as Director of Preparation. In addition, the Chairman appointed Zhou Xiangxian and Huang Mingdao as Deputy Directors of Preparation, and Ma Xun as Secretary-General. The Preparatory Office was established on September 25, 18, initially attached to the Zizhi Vocational School on Mapo Lane in Hangzhou, and began preparations. An accounting section was established, and Shu Hong was appointed as a clerk to manage it. Zhu Yaoting was appointed as a clerk to manage the engineering section, Wu Zhuozhi was appointed as a clerk to manage the administrative section, Wu Bangwei was appointed as a clerk to manage the competition section, and Yu Jimin was appointed as a clerk to manage the security section. A document accounting team was also established to assist. This is the situation of the organization.</p>
<h3 id="e100">(2) Financial Situation <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>This Games is an initiative in our country. Its fame has spread widely, and people from all over the country are vying to witness this grand event. Even countries around the world are eagerly anticipating it. Furthermore, given the attention of foreigners, it is especially important to strive for perfection. When the central government made its decision, the original budget was set at 260,000. The Zhejiang Provincial Government Committee decided to allocate 100,000, Jiangsu 10,000, Guangdong 10,000, Hubei 10,000, Anhui 3,000, Jiangxi 3,000, Shanghai Special Municipality 3,000, Guizhou 2,000, Liaoning 1,000, and Heilongjiang 500, for a total of 142,500. Compared to the original amount, there is still a shortage of more than 100,000. This is the financial situation.</p>
<h3 id="e101">(3) Construction of the Venue <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The competitions in the Games include all outdoor sports in the Far Eastern Games. To hold various sports in the same venue, the selection of the venue was extremely difficult. Initially, the training ground of Jianqiao was selected. Later, because it was too far from the city and inconvenient for transportation, it was decided to hold it at the Meidong Gaoqiao Dayingpan. The site was originally the garrison of the Sixth Division Engineering Battalion and the headquarters of the Third Regiment of the Security Team. As a result of the negotiations for relocation, the eastern and central parts of the camp remained for the use of the battalion, and the western houses and club were ceded for the use of the Games office. This is the situation of the venue and the buildings.</p>
<p>The venue covers an area of ​​approximately 300 acres, with a track and field stadium, running track, football field, basketball court, tennis court, and baseball field. Contractors were invited to bid. The design and drawing were the responsibility of the design and engineering sections. The bidding was decided on October 18th, and seven construction factories, including Xie Shun, were selected to build the venue. The original plan was for three months of design and three months of construction. However, since the beginning of last winter, there has been continuous rain and snow, totaling more than 80 days of rain and snow during the construction period. Therefore, the design period was shortened, and the construction period was extended to four months. From March 1st, as the opening of the Games approached, workers were added every day, always more than 700 people. Sometimes construction was still carried out at night. Therefore, this great project was successfully completed in the shortest possible time. The original gate in the venue was in disrepair due to age. The surrounding walls were also mottled and dilapidated. The gaps in the shade of the walls were filled with piles of tiles. In addition to repairing the gates and side doors to make them tall, solemn, and beautiful, several convenient doors were added in the four corners for entry and exit. The entire venue was leveled and fenced with bamboo fences to maintain order. For the convenience of visitors, many bleachers were built in the style of sports fields in various countries. They are spacious and comfortable and can accommodate 10,000 people. As for the command platform, it must be able to command the entire venue. It was carefully structured based on the style of the National Games in Europe and the United States, combined with the advantages of our country's inherent architecture. It is three lengths long and two lengths wide, and its height is sufficient to hold more than 200 people. During the construction, five pillars were required to support it. Once completed, all five pillars were removed so as not to obstruct the view of the audience. The point of support was based on Fang Xue. However, due to the lack of space in the venue, the swimming pool was held at the swimming pool of Zhijiang University. By March 15th, all projects had been completed, and only needed to be tidied up and painted before they could be arranged. However, from the 16th to the 18th, the provincial games were held, and construction had to be stopped. After a meeting of officials, it was decided that the construction would be fully completed on March 25th. This is the situation of the project.</p>
<h3 id="e102">(4) Preparation for Hospitality <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>This Games brings together athletes from all over the country. Overseas Chinese compatriots will also participate in the Games. It is estimated that there will be no fewer than 2,000 athletes. The preparation of dormitories and food was also very difficult. Wu Zhuozhi, Director of Administrative Affairs, Hua Dong Baseball Team</p>

<p>worked hard to plan. The western part of the barracks was repaired to provide accommodation for male athletes. More than 2,000 beds were rushed to be made. A large dining hall was built on top of the empty barracks. Bathrooms and toilets are fully equipped in the dormitory. The dining hall can accommodate 300 seats, and the air is spacious and hygienic. Female athletes will stay at the West Lake Villa as a residence. In order to treat athletes from afar, the Ministry of Railways, the Shipping Association, the China Merchants Bureau, and the Dalian Jinyi Company were specifically requested to charge all participating athletes half price. They were all approved. The Administrative Affairs Section prepared half-price certificates and sent them to various provinces and cities for distribution at the time. The China Travel Service was entrusted to provide hospitality and guidance in various places. Hospitality stations were set up at Hangzhou and Shanghai railway stations to guide visitors. The planning was thorough and meticulous.</p>

<p>The Games' opening, the distribution of free entry tickets to schools and organizations for visits, and the sale of tickets to other visitors for a fee were all restricted. All officials serving in the Games were issued official badges for identification. Appointed committee members and consultants were given committee badges. In addition, athletes were given athlete badges.</p>
<p>The emblem of this association was also submitted to the chairman for approval. The style is. There are five beams on the outside, symbolizing the five continents. There are 36 teeth inside, representing 36 groups. The three colors of red, blue, and white symbolize the blue sky, white sun, and red earth. The wavy line below indicates the Qiantang River tide. All kinds of badges are based on the emblem. In order to commemorate the Games and express its long-term significance, a calendar was specially printed. The emblem is listed on it. In the middle is the inscription of Zhang Jingjiang, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, a key figure in the party and the country. The brushwork is strong, and the momentum is full. It is a work of the year.</p>
<h3 id="e104">(6) Expanding Publicity <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The fame of the Games has spread throughout the country. In order to expand publicity, the Administrative Affairs Section specifically set up a publicity team to edit all publications, disseminate news messages, and design advertising matters. Wu Jianying was specially appointed as the team leader, and Xu Tailai, a reporter from Hangzhou, and others were appointed to assist him. From February 16th, news about the preparations was compiled and published nationwide every day. Wu Jianying also compiled a large book of abstracts to report the situation of the Preparatory Office and various regulations, so that the audience could follow the instructions. After the Games opened, a daily newspaper was compiled and printed every day to report the situation in the venue. Stores are necessary in the venue. Many houses were specially built for rent. The rent was kept low to show consideration for the difficulties of merchants. All of these are the preparation of the Administrative Affairs Section.</p>
<h3 id="e105">(7) Enthusiastic Participation <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>All 36 groups from provinces and cities across the country participated in the Games. The competition trophies were set at 12, including 8 for men and 4 for women, all based on the Far Eastern Games. A committee of 13 was established under the Competition Section to manage all competition affairs of the Games. As for the various competition regulations, they were all formulated by Wu Bangwei, clerk of the Competition Section, as the standard. This is the preparation situation of the competition.</p>
<p>Statistics from the beginning of the preparation to the opening are only half a year. All venue projects and various affairs have been completed without any omissions. If it were not for the enthusiasm and mission of the Director of Preparation and the hard work of the personnel of each section, it would be difficult to achieve this result. Therefore, the process of preparation is described to the readers.</p>

To the north of the square, in the middle is the dormitory for female athletes, and to the west is the dormitory for male athletes. In the southwest is a temporary dining hall that can accommodate more than 300 seats. In the southeast corner is a consumer cooperative. In front of the Preparatory Office, across a wide road, is the Games venue, surrounded by walls. The walls are covered with paintings and slogans, which make people feel excited. The gate is especially grand and solemn. Inside, bamboo fences are used for separation, which is full of variety. Every place has an emblem and guide lines, which are divided into a track and field stadium, running track, football field, basketball court, tennis court, and baseball field. There are many bleachers, which can accommodate 10,000 people. Simple houses are built on the edge of the field for commercial rental and sales. The command platform is located in the western part of the venue, overlooking the entire field, so it is convenient for command. In addition, the swimming pool is located in the mountain depression of Zhijiang University. The clear spring water is灌　and is especially hygienic.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Track and Field Stadium <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The track and field stadium is located on the far west side of the Games venue. There has been sufficient preparation in advance, so the equipment is quite complete. The command platform in the center of the west side of the stadium is in a straight line with the bleachers. At the west end of the stadium, there are several temporary rest rooms for athletes, which are the rest areas for male and female athletes. A white flagpole is erected in the center of the stadium. Flags of various countries are hung on all sides. The flags of the party and the country and the flag of the Games are fully inserted around the stadium. They are fluttering in the wind, shining brightly, and adding a lot of color to the venue. The most noteworthy thing is the wooden railing around the track, which is three feet high. Every ten feet or so, there is a partition with a number on it, which is said to be convenient for groups to visit and investigate, and to maintain order and safety. Although the matter is extremely minor, it can be said that the designer has racked his brains and is meticulous. During the Games, spectators enter and exit from one　in the northwest corner of the stadium.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Football Field <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The football field is on the left side of the track and field stadium, only separated by a fence. The length of the field is about 120 yards, and the width is about 70 yards, which is quite appropriate in size. The bleachers around the field can accommodate three or four thousand people. The entrance and exit are from the main gate on the south side of the field. Short railings are installed around the field to prevent spectators from rushing in. However, due to time constraints, the land has not been laid with grass, only sand and mud.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Basketball and Volleyball Courts <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>There is one basketball court and two volleyball courts, which are adjacent to each other. Bamboo fences are used as walls, covering an area of ​​more than ten acres. The basketball court is made of wooden boards, one foot above the ground, and painted red. It is more than one hundred and ten feet long and more than seventy feet wide. The blue frames are painted blue and stand upright outside the court. The white blue boards extend into the court by about seven feet. The construction is quite strong. The boundary lines of the ball court are black, and the red and black are not very clear. The court is surrounded by a three-foot-high railing to prevent spectators from entering. There are bleachers on the east, south, and west sides, which can accommodate more than a thousand spectators. In the middle of the bleachers on the west side is the seat for news reporters and guests. The scoreboard is on top of the reporter's seat, which is the highest point in the entire field. The audience can see the score of the game at a glance. To the west of the basketball court is the volleyball court. The two courts are connected to each other and can allow four teams to play at the same time. The ground is covered with grass, and the bleachers are on the east and west sides, with the same layout as the basketball court. Basketball and volleyball players enter and exit from the main gate on the north side. There are small gates in all four corners, and players can exit from the small gates after the game.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Tennis Court <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The tennis court is in the southeast corner, with entry and exit from the main gate on the south side. It covers an area of ​​six or seven acres and is separated from other courts by bamboo fences. The five tennis courts are arranged in a row, paved with yellow sand, which is smooth and beautiful. The southwest and east sides are bleachers. The south bleachers are about seven feet above the ground and can accommodate more than 1,500 people. There are also small gates in all four corners, which can connect to various courts.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Baseball Field <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The baseball field is located in the northeast of the Games venue. The field is vast, and there is only one row of bleachers on the north side. The layout is relatively simple. The outer field is a grass field, and the inner field is paved with fine coal cinder to prevent it from being slippery after rain. There are small gates on the southwest and west sides, which can connect to the basketball and volleyball courts.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Swimming Pool <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The All-China Games swimming pool, due to the temporary inability to construct a suitable swimming pool at the venue, has been decided to be used in conjunction with the pool at Jiang University at Erlongtou, Jianggan. As a reporter, seeing that sports are being actively promoted in China and thus are receiving national attention, I personally went to observe it. The findings are detailed below for the reference of my most admired swimming comrades and visitors from all directions. (A) "Location": This pool is located on the hillside of Erlongtou in Jianggan, facing the Qiantang River. To the left is the Ya Peak of Baopu, and to the right are the dormitories of Jiang University. Behind the pool and high above is the gymnasium under construction. The surrounding area is full of jagged rocks, bamboo, trees, flowers, and grass. The pavilion nestled among the Baopu Peaks adds a touch of tranquility, making my heart feel even more at ease. In relation to West Lake, the pool is located to the southwest; in relation to the Qiantang River, it is located to the northeast. (B) "Construction": The pool's construction began in the spring of 1927 (the 16th year of the Republic of China) and took about half a year to complete. The total construction cost from start to finish was approximately 5,000 yuan. The perimeter of the pool is made of reinforced concrete, with an iron pipe at each corner. On the southwest side of the pool's bottom, there is an outlet for draining water. The pool is surrounded by stone railings and distributed stone benches, unlike other places with glass awnings, which is to follow the natural trend. The bottom of the pool was originally carved from mountain rocks, giving it a unique architectural beauty. (C) "Water Source": The water used in the swimming pool is critical to the health of the swimmers and should be carefully considered. When the pool was first built, it was intended to mechanically draw water from the Qiantang River. However, after repeated tests by engineers, it was found that the river water not only had excessive salinity but also contained other unsanitary substances. Therefore, it was changed to use mountain spring water, drawn from the streams and ravines of the mountain through pipes into the pool. The water is warm, heavy, and exceptionally clean. (D) "Plans": After inspecting the pool, the reporter asked Mr. He Weicong, the Dean of Jiang University, if there were any other improvement plans. Mr. He said that he had long planned to carve the mountain walls on the left, right, and back of the pool into natural chair-like seats, so that those who are fascinated by swimming could have a comfortable place to sit and fulfill their desire to watch swimming. However, it is currently limited by funding, but he hopes to start construction in the near future. He added that it is a pity that this pool is being used for the All-China Games. The improvement of this pool is what I hope for, and I hope that the education authorities can make further efforts to construct more pools, so that new Chinese swimmers can have a place to show their skills. (E) "Transportation": The location of the swimming pool is about seven li from the entrance of the All-China Games. There are buses of the Gongsan section of the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau that can connect it. Other means of transportation, such as private cars and rickshaws, can also be used. Going west along the pool's front leads to Fuyang County; going east leads to Zhakou, where you can cross the river to Xixing. Climbing the mountain behind the pool, you can see the gentle and lovely West Lake.</p>

<p>Strengths of Each Team</p>

<p>Shanghai is the strongest</p>
<p>Too bad the Hong Kong team is not attending</p>
<p>Of the twelve participating teams, eleven remain because Beiping is not coming. Shanghai is undoubtedly the strongest, and can be sure of winning the championship. Guangdong, Tianjin, and Liaoning are second. It is a pity that the strong national team, Hong Kong, did not register to attend. Otherwise, the final could attract thousands of spectators from Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e124">(2) Basketball <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai, Kobe, and Tianjin have the best chance</p>
<p>This sport has the most registrations and is the most competitive in this All-China Games. According to the investigation, there are six strong teams. First, Tianjin; second, Beiping; third, Guangdong, all above on the order. Fourth, Shanghai; fifth, Kobe; sixth, Liaoning, all below on the order. Tianjin, Beiping, and Shanghai have the most fighting experience and strength. The championship should come from one of these teams. The military appearance is mighty, the fighting spirit is firm, and it is unknown who will be the final winner.</p>
<h3 id="e125">(3) Volleyball <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai and Hong Kong are formidable opponents</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they will meet in the second week</p>
<p>Hong Kong is the strongest. Before departing, the team defeated Guangdong. Shanghai is also very fierce, ambitious, and determined to win the championship. The Fujian team, which is not very noticeable, is also quite frightening. According to the order, Hong Kong and Shanghai will meet in the second week, which is unfortunate, because Shanghai and Hong Kong are the only formidable opponents.</p>
<h3 id="e126">(4) Baseball <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai and Hong Kong players have not registered</p>
<p>It is impossible to predict the championship</p>
<p>Shanghai and Hong Kong both have very experienced players, but because the Sports Association has decided to give the Far Eastern representative rights to the Tan Xiangshan team, both sides have not registered and only second-class players are participating in the competition, so it is impossible to predict the championship. Tianjin also has a very good chance.</p>
<h3 id="e127">(5) Tennis <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai and Guangdong have the best chance</p>
<p>Jiang Daozhang and He Jia of Hong Kong did not attend because the Hong Kong competition was not over. Otherwise, they could be sure of winning. Although Lin Baohua of Shanghai is still competing in the Philippines and has not returned, there are still several good players who can compete with the Guangdong and Tianjin teams. According to people familiar with the situation, Shanghai and Guangdong have the best chance.</p>
<h3 id="e128">(6) Track and Field <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Liaoning has many outstanding talents</p>
<p>Shanghai is strong on average</p>
<p>Liaoning has many outstanding talents, and Shanghai is strong on average. The championship will be a contest between these two teams. Beiping and Tianjin may also have strong performances and compete with these two teams.</p>

<p>Liaoning and Shanghai are also opponents</p>
<p>The competition situation is the same as in track and field. Other provinces and cities are far behind. Not many people have registered for this sport, which is unpopular.</p>
<h3 id="e130">(8) Swimming <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong is confident</p>
<p>Each province, city, and special district has few special talents, and registrations are also not enthusiastic, making it the most unpopular of the unpopular. Based on ideal speculation, the Hong Kong, Shanghai, Hunan, and Guangdong teams may be better. Hong Kong is especially promising.</p>
<h3 id="e131">(9) Women's Sports <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Liaoning and the Eastern Special District are not weak in track and field</p>
<p>Shanghai, Guangdong, Tianjin, and Jiangsu are good in ball sports</p>
<p>There are track and field, basketball, volleyball, and tennis events. It is unknown what the actual strength of each party is. Presumably, Liaoning and the Eastern Special District are not weak in track and field. There are many strong basketball teams, and the Guangdong and Shanghai teams are the strongest in volleyball. Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangdong, and Jiangsu are all good in tennis. It is difficult to predict the overall championship.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 11:00 AM, the Director and Deputy Director of the Games, Zhu Jiahua and Zhou Xiangxian, convened a meeting of representatives of each unit (i.e., each province and special city) in the Games conference room. More than 20 people attended. Chairman Zhu Jiahua performed the usual etiquette and discussed the following cases:</p>

If the number of first-place finishes is also the same, the unit with the most second-place finishes wins the championship, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e156">(2) Decathlon Championship <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The top four finishers in each individual event will be recorded. The scoring will be 16-4-2. The unit with the most points wins the championship. If two or more units have the same number of points, the method for determining the championship is the same as in Track and Field.</p>

<p>The winner of the knockout tournament, arranged by drawing lots, wins the championship. If two teams are tied at the end of regulation time, a 30-minute extension will be played. If the score is still tied, the Organizing Committee will schedule a make-up game.</p>
<h3 id="e159">(5) Basketball Championship <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>

If the score is tied at the end of the game, the men's game will be extended by five minutes or multiple five-minute periods until a winner is determined, according to the rules. Women's games will not have an overtime period; the team with more field goals wins. If the number of field goals is the same, the team with fewer fouls wins.</p>
<h3 id="e160">(6) Tennis Championship <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The winner of the knockout tournament, arranged by drawing lots, wins the championship. The Davis Cup rules will be used for two-team matches to determine the winner, i.e., four singles matches and one doubles match.

<p>The association will award one overall championship to both the men's and women's divisions. The unit with the most individual championships will be awarded the overall championship of the games. If two or more units have the same number of individual championships, the unit with the most runner-up (i.e. second place) finishes will be awarded the overall championship of the games, and so on.</p>
<p>If it is necessary to determine the runner-up for a ball sport championship due to the overall championship, the respective championship committee may order a match between the team that lost in the quarterfinals and the team that lost in the finals; the winner will be named runner-up. The same principle will be used for third place and below. However, if it is not related to the overall championship, there is no need to hold a separate match; the team that lost in the finals will be named runner-up.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Yesterday's Welcome Reception <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The National Games held a welcome reception for athletes from all over the country at the West Lake Auditorium at 7 PM last night (the 1st).</p>
<h3 id="e165">Reception and Security <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>More Staff Hired for Reception - With the National Games about to begin, athletes selected from the provinces to participate in Hangzhou have been arriving in droves, totaling nearly two thousand people. The association is well-prepared for the athletes' food and lodging, and is especially attentive to all aspects of reception. In addition to group leader Jiang Jiasheng, deputy group leader Chen Xuebai, and group members Yang Peisun and Yu Deyi, the organizing committee has rehired over fifty additional reception staff members due to the exceptionally enthusiastic arrival of athletes from various locations in recent days, as the existing staff members are unable to handle all the work.</p>
<p>Security arrangements at the venue have been thoroughly planned by the security division. Yesterday at 2 PM, the disciplinary committee, intending to foster camaraderie, specially convened the army, police, and boy scouts maintaining order at the venue to have a brief discussion on the command platform. Yu Jimin, executive member of the disciplinary committee, presided over the meeting, discussing methods of mutual communication and disciplinary action, and introducing the disciplinary committee members to the disciplinary officers.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Mr. Feng Yong's Chat in the Train <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Today is the opening day of the National Games. The train to Hangzhou was extremely lively. Yesterday, important figures who came to Hangzhou included Wang Zhengting, Chu Minyi, Jiang Menglin, and Zhang Wohua. Our reporter also took a special express train from Shanghai to Hangzhou at 8 AM yesterday morning, arriving at the station at 7 PM. The ticket office was already packed with people, as one could imagine. After entering the train car, there was no room to stand in third class, and second class was also full. I managed to find a seat in first class. Soon after, Feng Yong, the president of Northeastern Feng Yong University, and Mr. Chu Minyi and Hong Shen also arrived. The reporter stepped forward to greet them. The reporter had met Feng once before in Liaoning a few years ago. We chatted in the train with great interest. Feng was wearing a black wool school uniform, looking solemn. There was a slight scar on his forehead, a result of the plane crash near Suzhou. Feng said he flew to that area that day, but due to heavy rain and darkness, he had to land. Although the plane was slightly damaged, he was not injured, which was very fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Northeastern Prodigy Liu Changchun <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>After breaking the national record with a time of 10.6 seconds in the 100 meters, Northeastern prodigy Liu Changchun startled the nation. The reporter asked Feng about Liu. According to Feng, Liu is from Dalian and has a natural talent for sprinting. He could casually run 10.8 or 10.9 seconds in school. However, it is quite difficult to improve with natural talent alone; he needs to add hard and continuous training to have hope for the future. Mr. Liu is currently unwell and his performance has deteriorated considerably, but because the Games concern the whole country, he must participate to the best of his ability.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Climate and Sports are Related <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Feng also said that the climate in Liaoning is much colder than in the South, which makes it difficult to practice field events. Therefore, Liaoning's performance has not improved significantly in recent years. This is also related to geography. Fortunately, the authorities strongly promote sports and the facilities are quite adequate, resulting in today's achievements, which are not easy to come by.</p>
<h3 id="e169">The Football Team Should Not Be Underestimated <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The Feng Yong University football team has a strong reputation in North China. This time, they represent Liaoning in the competition in the South, and their strength should not be underestimated. Feng also paid great attention to this. Yesterday, he frequently displayed the football schedule in the train and told the reporter that the school had recently hired Gu Zhian and Li Guilin, two excellent football players who graduated from Yanjing University, to serve as coaches, hoping to train a strong team in the future. His enthusiasm is evident.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Snippets <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The Female Athletes Are Colorful - This time, a total of 36 groups participated in the Games, and the female athletes numbered over two hundred. Women from the North, South, East, and West gathered in one place, their appearances and clothing diverse and beautiful. The Liaoning female athletes have upright posture and are taller. The Guangdong female athletes are valiant and lively. The women from the Yangtze River region are graceful and agile. The colors of the clothing are mostly deep in the North, bright in the Central region, and exotic in the South, representing the customs of various regions. The Games venue is colorful and interesting. In the setting sun, West Lake is especially beautiful.</p>
<p>Funny Stories about Meal Problems - The venue has a large dining hall with enough seats for 300 people at the same time. The kitchen employs more than ten stokers, twenty cooks, forty general helpers, and twenty people to pick vegetables and wash rice, totaling over a hundred people. Such a large kitchen could be considered an army. However, the dining hall has no shelter, so it is exposed to wind and rain. The weather has been cold lately, so the food is not hot. The athletes have come from afar, and they are not used to cold food, which has caused some discomfort. A certain female athlete from this city could not eat at mealtime, and tears streamed down her face, which was also quite interesting. A European who came with the Liaoning athletes speaks fluent Chinese. He is said to be a ball sports teacher who lives with the athletes. When eating, he uses chopsticks to pick up rice and vegetables, and his hands are almost useless. He has been eating bread with the northern athletes lately, so he is no longer embarrassed.</p>
<p>Precise Statistics of Bowls and Plates - The statistics of all the furniture in the large dining hall are as follows: 240 tables, 960 benches, 1,920 rice bowls (not counting the spares), 920 vegetable bowls, 960 basins, 60 large rice buckets, 1,920 spoons, and 3,840 chopsticks.</p>
<p>Business is Booming Everywhere - A corner near the entrance of the venue is not surrounded by markets, but more and more athletes and staff are gathering there. Cigarettes and snacks are needed everywhere. For the first few days, there was nothing to buy. Lately, vendors from all over have been rushing to do speculative business. There is also a temporary store near the Games dormitory, with daily sales of 70 to 80 yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>Suspected of Being in a Dance Hall - The arrangement of each venue is quite beautiful, especially the basketball venue. The floor is paved with cedar planks and painted, making it bright and dazzling. Those who do not know might think it is a dance hall. When competing, the soles of the feet feel soft and the steps are light. Before the Games opened, athletes came to visit and could not resist jumping a few steps of the Charleston.</p>
<p>Hanli Presents Zhongling Printing Machines - The Zhongling pneumatic printing machine is a new invention of the Shanghai Hanli Company. The machine has exquisite decoration and is easy to carry. It is reported that Mr. Zhongling, the general manager of the company, has specially made two exquisite printing machines to encourage our country's sports talents. They will be transported to the National Games office soon and presented to the male and female overall champions, one each.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Smiles by the Lakeside - The area from the Lakeside Road to the Yue Fei Temple was cordoned off by sentries for three hours the day before yesterday (the 30th), and traffic was cut off. It was rumored that Chiang had come to Hangzhou to visit the National Games and enjoy the lake. In fact, Chiang was not on the lake that day. Yesterday morning (the 31st), Chiang strolled along the lakeside, paying homage to the statue of Chen Yingshi, lingering for a long time. Most of the people in the city did not know. Some female athletes from Guangdong were also enjoying the morning light and gazing at the lakeside. As soon as they saw that it was Chairman Chiang, they stopped and stared at him. After a while, he smiled, and Chiang returned the smile and left.</p>

<p>They Will Go to Japan After a Month of Training</p>
<p>Manila Correspondent: Our country's tennis stars Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai came to Manila at the invitation of the Carnival to join the All-Philippines tennis competition. Because the two had not cooperated in long-term training in their home country, they unfortunately failed. The 9th Far Eastern Games to be held in Japan are approaching soon. Some enthusiasts in this city, such as Mr. Lin Zhuguang, fear that there are no equivalent strong opponents in the country to practice with them, and the climate in the country is still cold and unsuitable for training, so they have been retained here to practice with the Filipino stars. After a month, they will go to Japan to represent our country in the competition for the championship.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Establishment of Two Courts Today According to the New Agreement <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Inauguration of Staff from Both Courts and Branch Prison Today</p>
<p>The Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court and the Shanghai Special District Court will be formally established today. Their organizational laws are based on the "Agreement for the Reorganization of the Provisional Court" recently signed in Beijing by Chinese and foreign representatives. The full text of the agreement has been published in Chinese and foreign newspapers without any changes. Shanghai now has four courts, three of which are directly under the Ministry of Justice. One is the Shanghai Local Court, which handles cases within the Shanghai area but outside the concessions. The other two courts are the Shanghai Special District Court, reorganized and established today to hear lawsuits within the Public Concession, and the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, which handles appeals from the Special District Court. In addition, the French Concession Court, which hears cases within the French Concession, still stands alone. It is reported that negotiations for its reorganization have also begun, but it is unknown when it will become a court within China's judicial system. Details obtained yesterday are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Handover by the Two Courts: Xu Weizhen, President of the Provisional Court of the Concession, and Yang Zhaoyun, President of the Shanghai Local Court, recently went to Beijing to meet with Wang Chonghui, President of the Judicial Yuan, to seek instructions. They then came to Shanghai to rush the handover. Yesterday was the last day before the agreement came into effect. All staff members of the two courts arrived at the court early at 9:00 AM to organize the files and records of each department, dividing them into closed and pending cases, totaling more than 40,000 cases. They had not finished by about 6:00 PM. Both parties agreed to implement the handover starting today.</p>
<p>Xu and Yang to Take Office This Morning: Xu Weizhen, newly appointed President of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Shanghai Higher Court, Yang Zhaoyun, President of the Jiangsu Shanghai Special District Court, Xie Fuzi, Warden of the Second Branch Prison of Jiangsu, and all staff members are scheduled to hold a swearing-in ceremony at 10:00 AM today in the auditorium of the Higher Court Branch on North Zhejiang Road. Ma Shouhua, Director of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, who was sent to supervise the oath, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and visited Presidents Xu and Yang for a long discussion. Wang Zhennan, the newly appointed Chief Prosecutor of the Higher Court Branch, also arrived from Beijing yesterday afternoon and will be able to take office separately this morning.</p>
<p>Ceremony Procedures: The procedures for the swearing-in ceremony this morning have been drafted. Invitations were sent to various agencies and organizations to attend. The chairman will be Director Ma Shouhua. The order is as follows: (1) The oath supervisor takes the chairman's seat; (2) The President of the Higher Court Branch, the Chief Prosecutor of the Higher Court Branch, the President of the Special District Court, the Chief Prosecutor of the Special District Court, and the Warden of the Second Branch Prison take their seats; (3) The entire audience stands at attention; (4) The chairman respectfully reads the Prime Minister's will; (5) Three minutes of silence; (6) The chairman confers the seals of office; (7) Swearing in; (8) Admonition by the oath supervisor; (9) Speech by the representative of the Party branch; (10) Speeches by guests; (11) Responses by the President and Chief Prosecutor; (12) Conclusion of the ceremony, photography, and adjournment.</p>
<p>Appointment of All Judges: All judges of the two courts have been appointed by the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The instructions only arrived in Shanghai the night before last. The organization of the two courts includes one president of the Higher Court, one presiding judge for each of the civil and criminal divisions, one chief prosecutor, four judges, one president of the Special District Court, one chief prosecutor, two alternate prosecutors, three presiding judges for the civil and criminal divisions, six judges, and nine alternate judges. The list is as follows: (A) Xu Weizhen, President of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court; Hu Yigu, Presiding Judge of the Civil Division; Han Zuzhi, Ye Zaiqian, Judges; Yang Yi, Alternate Judge; Song Yuan, Presiding Judge of the Criminal Division; Du Fuyao, Ye Zaichou, Judges; Gao Junxiang, Alternate Judge; Wang Zhennan, Chief Prosecutor; Guo Huaipu, Alternate Prosecutor; Zhang Linchun, Chief Clerk; Yang Zhaoyun, President of the Shanghai Special District Court; (B) Ying Shi, Presiding Judge of the Civil Division; Xu Wenrong, Ge Zhitan, Judges; He Qi, Li Mo, Pang Shurong, Cheng Shangfeng, Alternate Judges; Zhou Han, Presiding Judge of Criminal Division One; Wu Tingqi, Feng Shide, Luo Renji, Xiong Fei, Zuo Deshou, Judges; Xu Jiashi, Presiding Judge of Criminal Division Two; Sun Yuan, Zhou Daren, Judges; Luo Chongtai, Shen Shumu, Alternate Judges; Zhou Xianjue, Chief Prosecutor; Guo Wei, Alternate Prosecutor; Shen Chenghe, Chief Clerk; Xie Fuzi, Warden of the Branch Prison.</p>
<p>Separate Locations of the Two Courts: Although the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court and the Special District Court are still in the same location, their internal organizations must be separate. It is now reported that the Higher Court Branch will be located in the old building, while the Special District Court will be located in the new building for distinction.</p>
<p>Busy Staff: Yesterday was the last day of the existence of the Provisional Court and the Court of Appeal. The transition between the old and new was hectic. The staff of the court, from the president down, were extremely busy. President Xu Weizhen drove to the court after 8:00 AM and entered his office to work. The presiding judges, judges, and clerks each finished handling various civil and criminal cases, checked files, and gathered evidence for handover. Because there was no time, the criminal courts did not open yesterday. The police were notified in advance to temporarily suspend the transfer of various criminal cases. The civil courts only opened one enforcement court in the morning, presided over by Judge Xiong Fei. The work of the office staff was particularly chaotic, especially in the office of Chief Clerk Wheeler, because the Chief Clerk had to hand over his duties, and most of his Chinese and Western staff were assigned to different positions. Like the record room, it was also very complicated due to relocation. The record room was originally located on the third floor of the old building and must now be moved to the upper floor of the fourteenth court building next to the new building.</p>
<p>Appointment of Chinese and Western Police: According to the new agreement, the judicial police of the Special District Court should be recommended by the Municipal Council and submitted to the President for appointment. The list of candidates for these police officers was submitted by the Municipal Council the day before yesterday for the President's approval. However, it has not yet been officially announced. According to sources, the position of Police Chief has been confirmed to be filled by Whiting, a British head constable of Precinct 38. In addition, two Chinese and two Western officers will be appointed as police inspectors. The Chinese side will be filled by Yao Jialin and Tao Wendong. Both Yao and Tao are former staff members of the Yangwu Section of the Public Security Bureau and have continued to serve until now. As for the number of police officers, there are also Chinese and Western personnel. The Chinese police officers are also re-appointed from the original staff, including Deng Jiabing, Zhou Jinrong, Chen Diguang, He Xuebo, Tao Wenrong, Ning Menghua, and others. It is said that all-Chinese police officers will fill the position of constables. It is reported that each Chinese and Western police officer will be issued a set of uniforms, which will be worn starting today.</p>
<p>Wheeler's Farewell Message: Wheeler, the British Chief Clerk of the Provisional Court, will return to the Police Department of the Municipal Council after handing over his current position. Most of his staff will serve in the new court. Since they have worked together for many years, Wheeler gave each of them a letter as a farewell message, generally praising the staff for their loyal service.</p>
<h3 id="e173">New President of the Shanghai Local Court <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Shen Bingqian to Temporarily Act Before Wu Yuanchun Arrives</p>
<p>Since Yang Zhaoyun was transferred to be President of the Special District Court, the candidate for President of the Shanghai Local Court was discussed with President Yang by Wei Daoming, Minister of Judicial Administration, when he was in Shanghai. It was agreed that Wu Yuanchun, President of the Wuxian Local Court, would be transferred to the position. Before Wu Yuanchun arrives, Shen Bingqian, the Chief Prosecutor of the court, will temporarily act as president. However, the letter of appointment has not yet been delivered as of yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Precious Methods for Relief Funds <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Only by Prohibiting the Export of Cash</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that due to the extremely strong bidding market recently, people are bullish, causing the price of gold to exceed 500 taels. However, the main reason for this market situation is not due to the sluggish silver market, but due to the export of gold bars. As the number of gold bars available for trading in the market has decreased, the price of gold will naturally increase. It is reported that no less than 15,000 gold bars have now been agreed to be shipped overseas. Normally, there are only about 10,000 gold bars in Shanghai. If such a huge amount is exported, the resulting situation is unimaginable. The only way to provide relief is to prohibit the export of cash immediately.</p>

The internal equipment of the ship has been completed. A flag-raising ceremony is specifically scheduled for 8:00 AM today. Before Captain Zheng Yaoshu returns from Germany, Luo Zhitong, Captain of the Weisheng warship, will act as captain and be sworn in. Chen Xunyong, Commander of the Training Fleet of the Ministry, will supervise the oath. The ship's Party branch will also be established at the same time, and the special Party branch will also send personnel to participate. After the completion of the ceremony, the ship will sail to the Xiangshan waters of Ningbo at 2:00 PM today for long-distance sea trials and will return to Nanjing from Yong around the 4th of this month to be assigned to the Second Fleet and await deployment for defense.</p>
<h3 id="e176">County Property Management Office Submits Opinion on Establishing Grain Storage <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Property Management Office submitted a document to the County Government yesterday, stating, "Regarding the submission of a reply, we received an official letter complying with the provincial order to manage grain storage, and a copy was attached. Our office immediately convened a meeting of the accounting staff of our office and the heads of the six districts at our office on February 20 of this year. They all stated that the six districts of the county are adjacent to the commercial port and have convenient transportation, so there is no concern about lack of grain, only about lack of money. Therefore, in the sixth year of Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty, Mo Qianling Xiangzhi was approved by the governor to establish a grain storage project, but there was only property and no grain storage. For more than 50 years, relief was provided during famine years and grain was sold at a fixed price when rice was expensive. There was no inconvenience. It was decided to continue the old system of accumulating money instead of grain and reported to the County Government. The county started managing grain storage in the seventh year of Tongzhi and stored 20,215 stones of grain by the sixth year of Guangxu. The coastal land is humid, and the grain gradually rotted, so it was decided to accumulate money instead of grain. This is due to the terrain and is different from the situation in the inland. However, in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, He, the former military governor, extracted more than 106,000 yuan of grain funds. Public opinion in the area believed that accumulating grain was not as good as accumulating money, and accumulating money was not as good as accumulating property. Grain is prone to mildew, and money is prone to theft. Only accumulating property is more secure, and the resulting rent and interest can still be used for famine relief. This is also what this county has learned over the years and is different from the situation in the inland. Therefore, we are submitting the drafts of the reports of the warehouse directors in the 29th and 30th years of Guangxu. We respectfully request that the County Magistrate examine them and allow them to be submitted to the Department of Civil Affairs, which would be in the public interest."</p>

<p>Chief of the Map and Land Guardian Detained by the Bureau for Questioning</p>
<p>Commissioner for Stamping Deeds Dismissed and Investigated</p>
<p>Sun Fenglou, the Chief of the Map of the Seventh Village of the Twenty-eighth Bao of the Pusong District, and Zong Dishou, the Land Guardian, last winter colluded with Wang Linzhao, the Commissioner for Stamping Deeds in the district, to shorten the price of the deed and embezzle state taxes when they stole and sold more than eleven mu of civilian land located west of Wangjialou on Hongqiao Road in West Shanghai to the American business Dalei Foreign Firm. Zhu Yan, Director of the Land Bureau, learned of this and believed that Sun Fenglou and others dared to collude with the Commissioner for Stamping Deeds to steal and sell state land, which violated national law. Therefore, he summoned Sun Fenglou and Zong Dishou to the Bureau the day before yesterday and detained them temporarily. He also dismissed Wang Linzhao, the Commissioner for Stamping Deeds, in advance to await investigation. Chen Zhen was appointed to fill the vacancy. The deed was also confiscated and the tax payment was stopped.</p>

<p>The period of political tutelage was determined by the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee to be six years. All tasks during the period of political tutelage must be completed in stages within six years. In order to intensify municipal work, Mayor Zhang proposed a case of compiling a chronology of work during the period of political tutelage at the municipal meeting, which was resolved and passed. It is reported that the chronology will be drafted separately by each bureau based on its responsible business, taking into account actual needs and the city's financial resources, and then reviewed and announced by the municipal government.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Compilation of Memorial Week Activities of Various Institutions <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Executive Committee: Yesterday, the new Municipal Executive Committee held the first Prime Minister's Memorial Week on the third floor of the Municipal Party Headquarters, chaired by Chen Dezheng, who also gave a political report. His words were, "Today is the first Prime Minister's Memorial Week held by the new Municipal Executive Committee after its establishment, and it happens to be the last day of March. This is an important day to end the past and open up the future. One day later, tomorrow will be April 1, which is a quarter of the year, a 'quarter'. This contains important significance. On this day, we must ask ourselves whether we have completed a quarter of our work in party affairs. During this period, although remodeling and other matters took up some time, in the past three months of the 19th year of the Republic of China, we are given an important inspiration today for what we have not done hard in the past and what plans we will make in the future. We think of national affairs in the same way. In the past chaotic state, many inexplicable warlords were wandering and unpredictable, but now the situation shows a clear distinction. We have determined that counter-revolutionaries are ultimately counter-revolutionaries, and revolutionaries are ultimately revolutionaries. Counter-revolutionaries sacrifice national interests for personal rights and desires. Their original true colors have been fully revealed. Feng Yuxiang was released from Jian'an Village by Yan Xishan and returned to Shaanxi to redo his work of rebelling against the central government to oppose national interests. Yan Xishan has now removed his mask of serving the country and only does things for his personal interests. Among them, there are also a group of floating youths and昏庸old朽who were previously called revolutionaries, such as Wang Zhaoming, Chen Gongbo, Huang Shaogu, Xie Chi, Zou Lu, and Tan Zhen, as well as Chen Jiongming, who was most hated by the Prime Minister and never repented, and now they are going to form this reactionary group, or act as a matchmaker for them and run errands. The situation has reached the point where it is increasingly showing that counter-revolutionaries are ultimately counter-revolutionaries, and revolutionaries are ultimately revolutionaries. In the reactionary group in the north, although each has its own plans, it will ultimately fail. However, in fact, the rise of this reactionary group in the north not only hinders the development of party affairs and the progress of politics, but also damages the prestige of the country. In the past, some people inexplicably said that Wang Zhaoming was only too soft-eared, but there was still a considerable revolutionary history. Now we see, is Wang Zhaoming a revolutionary who betrayed the party, or is he just messing around regardless of means and purpose? As long as the central government is overthrown, he can collude with anything. Even if he says that he had a considerable revolutionary history in the past, is he now wholesale selling revolutionary history? Therefore, in the past chaotic state, Wang Zhaoming was still considered a revolutionary comrade. Now Wang Zhaoming's fox tail has been revealed. In fact, revolution is ultimately revolution, and counter-revolution is ultimately counter-revolution. For the sake of power, Wang Zhaoming, who changed his integrity and betrayed the party and the Prime Minister, is he a traitor of the Prime Minister? Once this point is clarified, our work from now on should start from here and not repeat the mistakes of the past. Because in the past chaotic state, counter-revolutionaries and revolutionaries were mixed together, and the distinction was not clear, so there was a stagnant pathology in the work. Now the revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries are very clearly distinguished. In the remaining three-quarters of the time in the nineteenth year, we must earnestly do the work of anti-counter-revolution. We should distinguish right from wrong, distinguish righteousness from profit, and Xie Chi, Zou Lu, Chen Gongbo, Wang Zhaoming, and others' reaction should be used as our mirror. We should do our best to assist the central government and lay the foundation for a peaceful and unified situation after the victory of the revolution. Although this meaning is simple, we should develop it from this point in our cultivation and efforts in the future, and the results will be very great. Even if we disregard the past quarter of the time, we can still achieve three-quarters of the year's results in the future. I hope you recognize some simple meanings and step up your efforts."</p>
<p>Garrison Headquarters: Yesterday, all officers of the Zhejiang-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters held Prime Minister's Memorial Week in the auditorium, chaired by Commander Xiong. After the ceremony, the commander gave instructions, saying, "Although the two things of acting arbitrarily and being independent are quite similar on the surface, they are actually very different. Acting arbitrarily means daring to do things that are not within one's own authority, and the result is often failure. However, when the commander is away and things need to be dealt with urgently, if everyone is unwilling to take responsibility and does not take a stand, the result will be failure. This requires a spirit of independence. The so-called independence, in the military, is to act first without waiting for orders based on the essentials of combat and the commander's intentions. In the organization, it is to do things based on all the rules and regulations, and sometimes it is not necessary to ask the commander for instructions. I hope all staff members pay attention to these two points."</p>

<h3 id="e184">Inspection of Chinese Silk Begins Today <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau was ordered to inspect exported Chinese silk. After the request of the silk factory merchants, the deadline was extended to April 1. Now the deadline has arrived, and all Chinese and foreign silk merchants have been notified to comply. It is understood that the silk factory merchants have prepared the procedures for sending silk for inspection, such as newly made silk canvas bags. The foreign merchants welcome the implementation of quantitative inspection of Chinese silk trade, which can be fairly valued. Today (the 1st) is the date for the public measurement and baking inspection to begin. The silk merchants of various foreign firms are preparing to send silk for inspection, including Mitsui with 700 bales, Jardine Matheson with 400 bales, and Qianli Lan Lebi Lianna, etc., totaling more than 1,000 bales. Miao Zhongxiu, the director of the silk inspection office, is supervising the technicians to carry out the baking inspection in order, preparing to complete the inspection within 14 hours and issue a public measurement inspection certificate for reporting to the Jianghai Customs for verification. It is scheduled to be loaded onto the Qihua Company ship on April 4 and released for export.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Case of Japanese Ship Sinking Our Fishing Boat <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>More Than Thirty Organizations Petition for Serious Negotiation</p>
<p>Regarding the incident in which the Japanese fishing vessel "Himejima Maru" collided with and sank our country's fishing boat owned by Zhu Aliang in the waters of Wenzhou during the first month of this year, and then escorted the boat owner and others to Nagasaki, subjecting them to various forms of intimidation, it was not until the boat owners returned to Shanghai and reported to the Fishery Guild the day before yesterday that the outside world learned the truth of the matter. The fact that it was concealed for as long as two months deeply astonished more than thirty organizations of stallholders in this city. Yesterday, they specially submitted a petition to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting a serious negotiation, stating in the petition (details omitted above): It is reported that the Japanese fishing vessel "Himejima Maru" was in our country's territorial waters in the waters of Wenzhou on the night of January 26 this year. The fact that the Japanese trespassed the boundary to fish constitutes an infringement on our national rights and interests, which is not permitted by public law. Moreover, they used a modern fishing boat to chase after our country's sailing boats, issuing warnings that were ignored. Not only did they not change course to avoid collision, but they even increased their speed, intentionally attempting to collide, with the intention of putting our fishermen to death. After the accident, they also kidnapped and detained the boat owners for severe interrogation, resorting to various forms of intimidation and keeping the matter secret, preventing outsiders from knowing. It was not until two days after the incident, when the boat owners were released and returned to China, that our nationals were able to learn about it. The Japanese are known for their brutality, ferocity, and disregard for public reason, which has aroused the common indignation of our people. Yet, they still do not repent, but instead resort to even more vicious means and cruel actions, sinking our country's fishing boats and disregarding the lives of Chinese people in our country's territorial waters. If this is tolerated, what is not? If a serious negotiation is not initiated, what dire consequences can we imagine? Therefore, we specially submit this petition to your esteemed ministry for review and approval, earnestly requesting you to promptly lodge a formal and serious negotiation with the Japanese side, demanding compensation for all losses, in order to uphold the law and appease public anger.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Shanghai Student Union Sends Telegram Protesting Japan's Exclusion of Overseas Chinese <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Student Union yesterday issued a telegram protesting Japan's exclusion of overseas Chinese, which read: To all newspaper offices and compatriots throughout the country: Japanese imperialists have intensified their aggression against our country and oppression of our people, resorting to any means necessary. In the past, they coerced our country to recognize the Twenty-One Demands, creating the national humiliation of May 9th. Recently, they sent troops to Shandong, hindering the progress of the revolution, creating the national humiliation of May 3rd. Our people have learned from past pain and are determined never to forget. However, old humiliations have not yet been avenged, and new hatreds are constantly added. Recently, Japanese imperialists have been obstructing and then expelling our compatriots from traveling to their country, uniformly prohibiting them from landing and implementing the exclusion of overseas Chinese. This is a severe violation of the international principle of equality. Their exclusion of our overseas Chinese is no less than an insult to all our compatriots, and their hostility towards our overseas Chinese is no less than the destruction of our entire nation. Anyone with blood in their veins cannot help but be outraged. If our people cannot unite to oppose this, not only will Japanese imperialists become even more unscrupulous, but other imperialists will also follow suit. The result of various countries excluding overseas Chinese will be that, although the world is vast, there will be no place for our Chinese nation to stand. Looking ahead, we cannot help but feel worried. Therefore, we send this telegram, deeply hoping that the whole country will unite to oppose the exclusion of overseas Chinese by Japanese imperialists, strictly implement economic severance with Japan, and urge them to realize their mistake, in order to protect the interests of overseas Chinese and maintain international equality. We respectfully submit this matter for your wise consideration. The Shanghai Special City Student Union bows in respect.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Abolition of Local Security Chiefs in County Areas Takes Effect Today <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The various local security chiefs (地保) in the areas under the jurisdiction of Shanghai County have already been explicitly ordered to be abolished uniformly on April 1st. The details have been repeatedly reported in previous newspapers. Now, it is found that since the division of Shanghai into city and county, the six districts under the jurisdiction of the county (originally eight townships, with only the three *bao* of the 16th, 18th, and 21st, and a part of the South 24th *bao* remaining, totaling more than 70 *tu*) are all impoverished areas. The local security chiefs of each *tu* are all assigned from those with more farmland (each *tu* having four, five, or six *kun*, which are plots of land), and they are rotated annually. However, when the time comes, there is often mutual evasion, because once appointed, they must make up for the shortfall, and being assigned as a local security chief is seen as an undesirable burden. Therefore, there are no problems with the abolition order this time. However, it is heard that the local security chiefs are requesting the return of the grain tax paid over the years for abandoned graves and households without heirs. Currently, the district offices have ordered the local security chiefs of each *tu* to transfer all procedures to the district, and then the district chief will direct the township public offices to receive them. Yesterday, the county government had already submitted the compliance report to the Civil Affairs Department for record.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Mr. Black Left Shanghai Yesterday Morning <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Flying to Seoul, Korea</p>
<p>*Wenhui Bao* reports that Mr. Black, the owner of the *Baltimore Sun* in the United States, departed at 9:00 this morning (March 31st) on a Maryland Free State aircraft from the White Rainbow Bridge Airfield, flying to Seoul, Korea. Many Chinese and American people saw him off. Mr. Black's trip is accompanied by two pilots and one engineer. His old friend, Pei Lan'en, will join him in London. After arriving in Seoul, he plans to continue flying to Tokyo, Japan. Then, he will ship the aircraft to San Francisco by ship and then to Baltimore to donate it to the local museum as a memorial to his journey around the world. Mr. Black and others will then travel through the major cities of Japan before returning home.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Final Test Flight of Japanese Aircraft <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Returned Home Yesterday</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Liaison International Aviation test flighted three times with satisfactory results. The day before yesterday, it flew from Fukuoka to Shanghai for the final time, arriving in Shanghai at 3:00 PM, taking five hours and twenty-six minutes. Yesterday (31st) at 8:00 AM, it departed from Shanghai and flew back to Japan. Because the official document approved by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs only allowed four test flights, it will not return to Shanghai after returning to Japan. Formal flights will only be conducted after the Sino-Japanese New Treaty is revised. As the Japanese side has requested that this navigation right be stated in the Sino-Japanese New Treaty, whether this is feasible still needs to be approved by the National Government.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Ministry of Finance Instructs the Shanghai Machine Industry Association to Issue Special Certificates for Tax-Exempt Goods <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machine Industry Association issued a notice to Shanghai National Goods Factories yesterday, stating: According to the Ministry of Finance's Customs Letter No. 17140, "Upon investigation, all machine-made foreign-style goods that have been approved on record and are transported from this trading port through another trading port to the interior for sale have been issued transport documents by the designated customs office to facilitate inspection along the way, so as to avoid double taxation. Those that are sold directly at the designated port, in addition to paying taxes at the export customs office and having the export customs office send a duplicate report to the customs office at the designated port for verification and release, are generally not issued any certificates. Recently, because merchants have been unable to provide evidence of tax payment for machine-made goods transported to the designated port, the tax and excise bureaus of various trading ports have ordered the goods to be taxed again. In order to facilitate commercial transport and avoid double taxation, the Ministry has instructed the Inspector General of Customs to formulate measures. Subsequently, whenever merchants declare machine-made foreign-style goods for sale at the designated port and are ordered by the local tax bureau to pay taxes again, they may apply to the customs office at the designated port for a special certificate of tax payment to provide proof. In addition to instructing the Customs Administration to order the Inspector General of Customs to forward the order to all customs commissioners for compliance, this is hereby ordered to your association to forward to all factories for compliance. Please take note."</p>

<p>Transferred from Abroad to Come to China</p>
<p>The negotiation of consular jurisdiction, a major issue in the Sino-Japanese New Treaty revision, will officially begin soon. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, considering this issue to be important, issued instructions to Shanghai yesterday, appointing full-power negotiators. In addition to appointing existing personnel from the Japanese Embassy to take on different roles, they also telegraphed Shigemitsu Gorō, Secretary of the Japanese Embassy in the United States, to come to China to assist with the negotiation of consular jurisdiction. Secretary Shigemitsu has already departed from the United States and is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the middle of this month. The details of the full-power personnel appointed by the Japanese government to negotiate legal rights are listed below: Minister Plenipotentiary Shigemitsu Mamoru, First Secretary Moriya, Second Secretary Horiuchi Shigemitsu, and Secretary Okazaki Hayashide.</p>
<h3 id="e192">News of Chinese Ships on the Yangtze River <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Shipping Association Agreement: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received a telegram from Li Yunliang, Chief of the Business Department in Hankou, stating that there were many goods and few ships upstream, and that measures should be taken quickly to reserve Yangtze River ships for traffic, so as not to allow foreign ships to seize the great business opportunities. Yesterday afternoon, representatives from various companies were sent to the Shipping Association to convene a meeting of various shipping merchants to discuss maintaining Yangtze River shipping. If the Hankou side needs various Chinese ships to suspend service again, it should be assigned by the various companies so that one or two companies do not suffer the losses alone, and business and transportation can also be taken into account. It was agreed to proceed accordingly.</p>
<p>Large Decrease in Incoming Goods: According to usual practice, the downstream goods from upstream are currently in a state of congestion. However, since yesterday's incoming Yangtze River ships, the cargo arriving in Shanghai has greatly decreased. The reasons are: (1) Due to the strike wave in various ports along the upper Yangtze River, the shipping lines are not open, and goods from Sichuan have been cut off. (2) Due to military relations on the Pinghan Railway, combined transport is hindered, and goods cannot reach Hankou. Therefore, the downstream goods transported by yesterday's incoming Yangtze River ships were only two-thirds of what they were a week ago. In the future, due to the decrease in ships, incoming goods will become increasingly scarce.</p>
<p>Yichang Strike: Yesterday, this port received a telegram from Yichang stating that the dockworkers' union in that port is demanding increased wages due to soaring living costs. As it has not been agreed upon by the various shipping companies, the dockworkers' union has issued a declaration that it will implement a general strike from April 1st. From now on, the loading and unloading of goods on the Hankou-Yichang route will not be able to take place in Yichang. Upstream freight transport is being severely blocked. The strike case in Chongqing has not yet resumed, and now a labor dispute has arisen in Yichang. Goods leaving Shanghai will also be affected by the inability to transport them.</p>

<p>Lack of Northern Goods: The goods shipped from Shanghai to North China have plummeted in recent days. The grain guild in Tianjin has already stopped importing goods, and Shanghai has no rice, wheat, or flour to ship there. Very few textiles are also being shipped. As for Qingdao, due to the accumulation of goods in various warehouses, customers are not picking them up, so they have also telegraphed Shanghai to stop shipping. As for the goods coming from North China, except for large amounts of Yantai salt being transported to the Yangtze River, there is nothing else being shipped. Commerce in North China is already in a state of near-shutdown.</p>
<p>Yingkou Raises Freight Rates: The various shipping companies in this port have agreed that, starting today, the freight rates for goods shipped from Shanghai to Yingkou will also be increased by 10% of the original amount, according to the methods of Tianjin and other ports. Flour and textiles are excluded; all other goods will increase in price. This has already been notified to the various shipping agents.</p>

<p>*Wenhui Bao* reports that after the Japanese First Destroyer Flotilla arrived in Shanghai from Japan, its 1,500 soldiers disembarked at the Customs Wharf and marched in formation to the Japanese Naval Landing Forces headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road. Then, they divided into several small teams and went to the Japanese Cemetery in Zhabei to pay respects at the graves. Rear Admiral Goto, the commander, paid a visit to Chargé d'Affaires Shimizu this morning (March 31st). This evening, he will attend a welcome banquet for Japanese residents at the Japanese Club. It is heard that the fleet will sail back to the Sasebo Naval Base on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>The China National Products Maintenance Association and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Machine Association recently jointly issued a letter to the silk industry associations in various places in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces regarding the solicitation of exhibits for the National Silk Exhibition, which stated: Respectfully informing you that we have received a letter from the Shanghai Solicitation Office for the National Silk Exhibition (located in the Commodity Exhibition Hall of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce) stating that the National Silk Exhibition held by the National Goods Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has been scheduled to open in Beijing on May 5th. A Shanghai Solicitation Office has been newly established, and commissioners have been appointed to be responsible for the solicitation. We should request your association to inform the various silk manufacturers to select new and innovative products and enthusiastically participate, submitting them to our office by April 20th, receiving a receipt, and requesting the regulations and application forms from our association. Based on this, it is found that the domestic silk industry is currently in a period of decline. Fortunately, the government is making efforts to promote and hold exhibitions, which is enough to reverse the decline and save the downward trend. Therefore, we are specially issuing this letter to you, earnestly requesting your office to promptly forward it to the various firms and factories under your jurisdiction, carefully select products, and send them to our office by the deadline for transport to Beijing to participate in the competition. We deeply look forward to it.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Exported Ham Must Undergo Inspection Before and After Slaughter <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Ham is one of our country's export goods. The trade in sales to US territories can be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars each year. In the past ten years, the United States has used the excuse that slaughterhouses have not been widely established in various parts of our country, and that meat has not been inspected before and after slaughter, to prohibit the import of Chinese ham. Its territory, the Philippines, has also repeatedly proposed the abolition of import. In order to maintain and develop foreign trade, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, since the establishment of the Livestock Product Inspection Office last May, has gathered merchants who have always been engaged in ham exports to the Philippines and urged them to quickly establish new-style slaughterhouses. All hams going to the Philippines must be made from pig legs that have undergone inspection before and after slaughter, in order to prevent Philippine government officials from finding an excuse and to find ways to have the United States also lift the ban. This slaughterhouse has already been purchased by merchants last winter on Pujing Bridge outside the North Gate of Rugao to build an industry, and the construction was completed in March of this year, starting the slaughter of pigs and curing of ham. After the merchants reported to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, they selected veterinary specialists to implement inspection procedures. Currently, the bureau has ordered technician Wu Deming to go to Rugao to be stationed at the factory to carry out inspections before and after slaughter.</p>

<h3 id="e199">The Shanghai-Wusong Railway Steam-Powered Automobile Held an Inaugural Ceremony Yesterday <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Officially Opens for Passenger Transport Starting Today</p>
<p>Shanghai Station to Be Moved East to Baoshan Road</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Wusong branch of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, which has been converted to steam-powered automobiles, has been reported on in detail in this newspaper. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Liu Weichi, Director of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways and concurrently the Director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, specially invited people from all walks of life to hold an inaugural ceremony at the Baotaiwan Fort in Wusong. More than 200 people from all walks of life participated in the grand ceremony. Before 10:00 AM, they gathered at the North Station, where they were received by representatives from the railway bureau and guided onto the automobiles. At 10:00 AM, they departed from Shanghai and arrived directly at the Baotaiwan Fort Station at 10:31 AM. After getting off the train, they were invited to the seaside hotel for the opening ceremony. First, Director Liu reported on the importance of Shanghai-Wusong transportation and the process of the railway bureau converting to new-style steam-powered automobiles. Then, guests such as Li Jun, the representative of the municipal party department, Wang Kechang, the director of the naval reorganization area office, and reporters from various newspapers gave speeches, elaborating on transportation. After the ceremony, refreshments were served, and the guests returned to the Baotaiwan Fort Station to take photos. The guests took the original train back to the North Station at 12:13 PM. Starting today (April 1st), tickets will be officially sold and the line will be open for traffic. All old-style passenger cars will be transferred to the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. This steam-powered car currently has a total of five vehicles, which were ordered from the British firm Jardine Matheson in 1929 and shipped to Shanghai on November 12th of last year. Each vehicle cost £4,140. The car body was manufactured by the Wusong Car Factory of the Railway Bureau. It has a speed of 45 miles per hour and 107 horsepower. It can accommodate 14 first-class passengers and 139 third-class passengers. The car body has a volume of 103 feet and 9 inches. The steam car does not use a locomotive to tow it; the engine is installed at one end of the car. The interior of the car is cleaner than ordinary trains, and the ride is stable and fast. There are no second-class seats. Each car is divided into two sections. After the Shanghai-Wusong branch switched to this new type of automobile, there will be as many as 74 round trips per day. The opening and closing of the gates at the intersection of the railway and Baoshan Road is busier than before, which greatly affects the traffic on Baoshan Road. Therefore, the railway bureau has decided to move the station to the Yifuli address at the east end of Baoshan Road. It is heard that the railway bureau has already negotiated with the landlord of Yifuli on demolition and relocation measures, and construction will begin soon.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Confessions of a Madman <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Mad and incoherent</p>
<p>Haircut and Manchu clothing are intolerable by Heaven</p>
<p>Too many schools are no good</p>
<p>Reasons for killing as such</p>
<p>A madman named Zhang Jiazhen in the South City, in front of the Qunxue Association gate north of Xiaonanmen on Zhonghua Road, killed two people with a knife and wounded one child. The patrolling police officer shot the madman and subdued him. Commander Jin of the First District's Third Sub-precinct instructed the madman to be taken to the Xin Puyu Hall for treatment. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that yesterday morning, Commander Jin Dianyang of the First District's Third Sub-precinct appointed Patrolman Wang Zuoxian to go to the Xin Puyu Hall to record the madman's confession and observe his injuries. When Patrolman Wang arrived at the hall's ward, he asked the madman Zhang Jiazhen, "(Question) What kind of business do you do? (Answer) Small business. (Question) Did you have an argument with anyone yesterday? (Answer) Yes, I had an argument with a woman upstairs in the second landlord's house. (Question) Why did you argue? (Answer) Because I bumped into her body when I walked past, and she argued with me. (Question) Since you argued with the woman upstairs, why did you kill another woman instead? (Answer) This was because Heaven taught me to kill her. (Question) How did Heaven teach you to kill her? (Answer) Because she moved customs and habits, cut her hair and wore Manchu clothing, so Heaven did not allow such a dress and taught me to kill her. (Question) Do you know that you killed her? (Answer) I know that I killed her. (Question) According to you, this woman was killed because she cut her hair and wore Manchu clothing, so Heaven taught you to kill her, but why did you kill the child? (Answer) Because there are too many schools, and they are all no good, so I want to kill students. (Question) Do you know how many children you killed? (Answer) I killed two. (Question) Where did this murder weapon come from? (Answer) One was always there, and one was custom-made from the iron shop on Miezuo Street outside Dadongmen last year. (Question) What did you make this knife for? (Answer) For selling beef. (Question) Have you sold beef before? (Answer) I have sold it last year. (Question) Since you already had one, why did you buy another one? What is the reason? (Answer) One for personal use, one wanted to give to the second landlord's younger brother. (Question) What is the name of the first landlord's younger brother? (Answer) I don't know. (Question) Where do you usually put these two knives? (Answer) In a rattan bag," etc. When Patrolman Wang asked further questions, the answers were incoherent and did not correspond to the questions. He was simply mad and incoherent. Patrolman Wang then inquired with the doctor, who said that the madman's gunshot wound to the left leg (which happened to hit the blade) was not serious because it was blocked by the blade. The gunshot wound to his abdomen entered from the right side and exited from the left side, but because it barely penetrated the flesh, the internal organs were not injured and there was no danger to his life. However, the gunshot wound to the back of his right foot was the most severe, and the foot bone was shattered, becoming a useless foot with no need to be kept. It has been decided to amputate the useless foot tomorrow (i.e., today). Patrolman Wang then went to No. 20 Matianxing Lane, the house where the madman lived, to investigate whether there was any conflict with the madman. The woman Chen Zhangshi upstairs at No. 20 claimed to be from Changzhou and her husband was a coppersmith. Yesterday morning at around 11:00 AM, she was washing vegetables next to the tap. The madman walked past her and deliberately touched her hand. She asked him if he was crazy. Unexpectedly, he glared at her with anger and was about to use force. She was afraid of his fierceness and dared not argue with him. Neighbors dissuaded him, and he went out. At around 1:00 PM in the afternoon, the tragedy occurred. Patrolman Wang then inspected the madman's bed and found two rattan bags. Patrolman Wang also went to the area of Miezuo Street to investigate the iron shop. He found the Zhu Wanshun Iron Shop opened by Zhu Along in the Xiaojiu Hua area at the entrance of Miezuo Street. When asked if he had made a knife last year, he said that in November of last year, the madman did come to order a knife, which cost one yuan. The madman said that it was for cutting noodles. Patrolman Wang then returned to the precinct and presented his findings to Commander Jin for approval. The child Hu Hongliang, who was injured at the Nanyang Hospital, was not in worse condition.</p>

<p>Four Bandits Robbed a Family in Gujiabang</p>
<p>Indian Patrol Hears News and Catches Robbers</p>
<p>Two Chinese Patrolmen One Killed One Seriously Injured</p>
<p>Bandits Escape in Gunfight</p>
<p>Yesterday at 7:30 PM, while the Gu Xuegen family was having dinner in a flat in Gujiabang, Changping Road, West Shanghai, four bandits suddenly arrived, each carrying a handgun, wearing blue cloth shirts and pants, and speaking with mixed accents. The four members of the Gu family were terrified at the sight of the bandits. One of the bandits pointed a gun at Mrs. Gu's chest and ordered her to hand over silver dollars, otherwise she would be killed on the spot. It turned out that Gu Xuegen had won more than 200 yuan in a hui yesterday at a friend's house, which made the bandits covetous. At this time, Mrs. Gu could not move, while the others stood guard. The other two bandits rummaged through boxes and chests, robbing more than 200 yuan in cash. At this time, a neighbor happened to pass by the door and learned that a robbery had occurred in the Gu family. He immediately ran to report to the Indian patrolman stationed at the corner of Gordon Road and Macheng Road. Upon hearing the news, the patrolman, together with two Chinese patrolmen No. 463 and No. 2138, rushed to intercept. At this time, the four bandits, seeing that the situation was not good, broke out of the door and drew their handguns, shooting at the patrolmen. The patrolmen, seeing the bullets flying, showed no mercy and immediately returned fire. At that time, two Chinese patrolmen happened to be patrolling here and joined the battle. For a time, bullets flew in the air on Changping Road, and the situation was very tense. Fortunately, the area was remote and sparsely populated, so there were no accidental injuries. Unexpectedly, while the bandits were fighting with the patrolmen, a bandit guarding the back door rushed over with a gun, and the bullets did not miss, hitting Chinese patrolman No. 463 in the chest, who immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. At the same time, Chinese patrolman No. 2138 was also shot, suffering unbearable pain, and retreated backward. The remaining three patrolmen, seeing their companions injured, were no longer in the mood to fight. The bandits took the opportunity to flee in all directions. By the time the full shift of detectives from the Gordon Road Police Station arrived, the bandits had disappeared. They immediately took the two injured patrolmen to the Bureau of Public Works Hospital for treatment. On the way, Chinese patrolman No. 463 died due to his serious injuries. After the doctors treated Chinese patrolman No. 2138, he was no longer in danger of death.</p>

<p>Eleven Mauser Pistols</p>
<p>Fifteen Thousand Bullets</p>
<p>Police Refuse Bribe</p>
<p>Principal Flees Upon Hearing the News</p>
<p>Li Wenhan, captain of the Second Squad of the Zhabei Water Patrol, yesterday afternoon supervised patrolman Zhang Yushu, police officer Wang Yunde, and others to patrol boats in the river near the Wuzhen Road Bridge. When they patrolled the river surface east of Yongshengli east, they saw a barge loaded with many boxes of kerosene. The boatman's behavior was very suspicious. The police immediately ordered him to stop and board the boat for inspection. They found eleven Mauser pistols, six sacks, and one wooden box of bullets, totaling fifteen thousand three hundred rounds, in the cabin. Unexpectedly, the boatman, Shen Zhongyao, seeing that his plan had been revealed, panicked and suddenly offered 80 yuan as a bribe. The police strictly refused and immediately took the boatman Shen Zhongyao and his wife, Xia, as well as the military supplies, to the squad for interrogation. Shen Zhongyao confessed that he was from Yancheng, 44 years old, and that the guns and bullets on the boat were entrusted to him by his friend Xu Mingke to take to Jiangbei. Xu loaded the military supplies onto a sampan from Pudong last night and transferred them to his boat. He lives in a grass shed west of the Fengtai Silk Factory. After obtaining the confession, Officer Li ordered the police to go to the address to arrest Xu, but Xu had fled upon hearing the news. He then sent the seized military supplies, boatman, and bribe money to the Judicial Section for verification and handling.</p>

<p>Used Outer Garment as Fare</p>
<p>Secretary Zhou is Her Father</p>
<p>Calmly Talks at Police Station</p>
<p>Previously Committed a Crime and Sent to Court</p>
<p>A Hubei woman, Ren Yaonan, previously committed a theft and was arrested by the Hongkou Patrol. After being sentenced by the Provisional Court to one month's detention with a two-year reprieve, she was to be sent back to her hometown by the court, with a police officer escorting her to the wharf to board a boat back to Hankou. However, on the way, Ren Yaonan suddenly came up with a trick, biting the escorting police officer's finger and shouting, falsely claiming she was being abducted. The police officer brought her back to the court and sent her to the Shanghai North Detention Center at Dawang Temple on North Chengdu Road for custody. Around 7 PM the night before, the woman suddenly took advantage of a moment of inattention and escaped over the wall. She hired a rickshaw to the North Station to flee. Upon arriving at her destination, she had no money left and couldn't pay the fare. In desperation, she took off the outer robe she was wearing and gave it to the rickshaw puller to cover the fare. The rickshaw puller refused, and they argued. A police officer from the 5th District Public Security Bureau noticed and, suspecting something was amiss, intervened. Ren Yaonan then claimed to be the daughter of Secretary Zhou of the Nanjing Railway Department, which was proven to be false. She was taken back to the police station. Yesterday, the detention center sent a letter to the police station to collect her. Ren is about 19 years old, with short hair, wearing high-heeled leather shoes, a black cotton cheongsam, and a round, French-style hat. Her appearance is quite charming. When asked at the station where she got the hat, she replied, "Times have changed. I wear my hat, it's no one else's business. It's better to take back what you said." It's clear she is quick-witted.</p>

<p>Ding Jingen, a man from Yanwo Sand outside Wusongkou, nearly seventy years old, had been working as a foreman at the Engineering Department of the Ling[missing character] [missing character] Bureau. He had lived in Danggang (the northern section of Laoshu Sand) for many years. Recently, he retired due to old age and received several hundred yuan in public accumulation funds, hoping to enjoy his remaining years. Unexpectedly, Ding had a friend named Shi, who often came and went from Ding's house and had an affair with Ding's wife. They had a secret relationship and deep affection. Ding trusted him as a friend and had no suspicions. However, the adulterous couple had malicious intentions and secretly plotted a deadly trap. They prepared wine and meat the night before, and the adulterer Shi accompanied Ding in drinking heartily, getting him drunk. Late at night, they murdered him. Yesterday morning, neighbors heard about it and went to check. They found Ding lying face-up in a pool of blood, with a stab wound on his lower abdomen, his stomach skin torn open, blood and flesh scattered, a horrible sight. The neighbors tied his wife to the corpse and arrested the adulterer Shi. It's said that the body has not yet been collected for burial.

Later, he filed a complaint with the Supreme Court. The court ordered a retrial. The trial took place on the 24th of last month, and after the arguments concluded, the verdict was scheduled for 2 PM yesterday. At that time, presiding judge Hu Yigu, judge Ye Zai[missing character], and judge Zhu Ganlin announced the verdict. Su, along with his agent, Lawyer Qu Yue, were present in court.

<p>The Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) hosted a banquet at the Lianhua General Association yesterday at noon to raise annual funds, inviting leaders from all walks of life. Among those present were Mrs. Wang Daren, Mrs. Huang Bingquan, Mrs. Li Qingmao, Mrs. Li Gengsheng, Mrs. Zhang Fuliang, Mrs. Xue Xianzhou, Mrs. Zheng Wei, Mrs. Li Juyang, Ms. Zhang Zhixue, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, and others, about one hundred people. During the banquet, Chairwoman Mei Huaquan stated that the status of women's education in a country is now recognized as important by the world, and therefore there is a considerable understanding and assistance for the YWCA, which is the only organization that develops women's education in four aspects. The Chinese YWCA has branches in fifteen cities, and its purpose is to unite awakened women for social construction movements.</p>
<p>Shanghai YWCA and its affiliated foreign branch required a total of 20,000 yuan in annual expenses last year, including 13,100 yuan for Shanghai YWCA and 6,900 yuan for the foreign branch. All these amounts were used to develop this year's activities. It is hoped that men and women who care about social causes will share this responsibility and generously donate, so that their merits will not be considered the same as those who invest for profit. Then, Ms. Xinde (Hitder), the executive secretary, reported on the organization's work, such as mass education classes, service labor areas, Shaonü Huaguang Troupe (Girls' Glorious Light Troupe), family discussion groups, career placement departments, children's health societies, religious research groups, and the achievements of the dormitory, as well as that the fundraising campaign would last for three weeks. Next, Mr. Mc Naugten, a director of the Municipal Council, and Mr. Zhao Jinqing of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce gave speeches. There was also music and dance to add to the entertainment, and then they took photos and dispersed happily.</p>

The meeting was very well attended. However, Hu Puan, the former editor of the compilation department, was unable to come to Shanghai because he had just become the director of the Su Min Hall and specially commissioned his brother, Jichen, to attend on his behalf.</p>

<p>No Shortage of Water for Summer Use</p>
<p>The Inland Water Company is adding rapid filtration, concrete sedimentation, and clear water pools, as well as purchasing power-generating equipment to improve water quality and increase water volume. The Municipal Public Works Bureau urged speedy completion, as reported previously. After receiving the order, the company invited representatives from Jiuji Construction Factory and Shenchang Foreign Firm to discuss ways to speed up the work to achieve rapid completion. It is now known that Jiuji has sent a letter stating that the mechanical equipment will be completed and installed two months after the first pumping station and two or three months after the second pumping station. Shenchang also stated in a letter that the pumping motors are all ready, and all installation switches and wiring can be completed within two weeks after the base and connecting pipes are completed. Therefore, it is estimated that water from the filtration pool will be connected by mid-May, and there will be no shortage of water for summer use.</p>

<p>The Continental Daily published a lengthy article yesterday on the Nanjing Road Dalun Real Estate Company's case, expressing dissatisfaction with the court's refusal to accept the evidence of the landlord's representative (i.e., Dalun Company) and its recognition of the tenants' (e.g., Lao Da Fang) request to extend the lease as customary practice. The newspaper believes that this move has profound implications for the economic future and argues that landlords should have full authority to dispose of their property and should not be subject to unreasonable demands from tenants; otherwise, in the future, the prices of goods sold in stores will be determined by customers themselves, which is absurd. The newspaper also expressed dissatisfaction with the actions of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, believing that it is controlled by a small number of tenant members and does not represent the true situation.</p>

<p>The Municipal Social Bureau previously received a report from the board of directors of Yixiang District Hourentang, proposing to sell a piece of land of more than 13 acres located on the Yangshupu Road Tianhou Palace site to fund the construction of Yixiang Hospital and a nursery. After investigation, the bureau found that the land was located in an important area with convenient transportation and close proximity to the city center, and that it has great potential for future development. The proposed sale price of the hall also differed greatly from the land bureau's valuation. Therefore, to ensure the proper handling of public property, the bureau rejected the hall's request to sell the land, stating that if hospitals, etc. need to be established, the hall should raise funds separately.</p>

<p>Also Requests Arrest of Vagrants</p>
<p>The Songhu Rehabilitation Center previously requested the Social Bureau to forward a request to the Public Security Bureau for firearms due to the weak police force in the center, in order to strengthen defense and prepare for unforeseen circumstances. Yesterday, the Social Bureau approved the request, forwarding it to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. The Public Security Bureau replied that the center houses a large number of vagrants, and the request for additional firearms is a precautionary measure and can be approved. An order has been issued to the Fifth District to allocate firearms appropriately. Furthermore, due to the large number of vagrants in Pudong, which affects tax collection, the center requested the Public Security Bureau to order the Third District and its subordinate branches to arrest and send vagrants to the center. Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau replied that it is currently facing difficulties in dealing with vagrants and beggars because the Shanghai Vagrant Training Center is full and no longer accepting people, and the Shelter for the Destitute is also about to close. Therefore, in addition to ordering each district to send vagrants and beggars to your center for accommodation, a corresponding reply is made. Furthermore, there is a proliferation of female beggars in the city, and there is no corresponding organization to accommodate them. It is proposed to plan to add facilities to expand the accommodation.</p>

<p>The Bandit Den is on Route Père Robert</p>
<p>Yan Ruling Endures Great Suffering</p>
<p>Exploring the Bandit's Hideout, Over Eighty Shots Fired</p>
<p>No One Injured, Four Bandits Captured Alive</p>
<p>Yan Ruling, a wealthy businessman from Ningbo and former compradore of the French-owned Eastern Fur Company, resides at No. 173 Changxing Lane, North Shanxi Road. Recently, he purchased a separate residence on Route Lafayette in the French Concession and hired workers to renovate it. On the morning of the 23rd of this month, at around 10 AM, Yan drove his No. 8443 car to inspect the progress. Unexpectedly, a number of kidnappers were mixed among the painters. When Yan entered the room to inquire with the workers, the doors suddenly closed, and the kidnappers pointed guns at Yan Ruling, preventing him from moving. Yan's bodyguards, three or four people, were in the corridor and were unaware of what their master had encountered, and therefore were unable to help. The kidnappers had parked two cars at the door and immediately kidnapped the victim into the car, driving west.</p>
<p>Location of Concealment: After Yan was kidnapped, the French Concession police authorities spared no effort in investigating the case. Over the past seven or eight days, they gathered information and clues. However, they did not know the exact location where the victim was being held. Until 11 AM yesterday, Jin Jiulin, the special investigator of the French Concession Patrol, and Western Detectives Feiji Shou and Shi Langdi learned that Yan Ruling was being held by the bandits in a Western-style house at No. 356 Route Père Robert. They immediately dispatched detectives to surround the area and prepare for action. Around 10:30 PM that night, Investigator Jin, along with about 20 Chinese and Western detectives, fully armed, drove to the above location to make the arrests.</p>
<p>Detective Combat: The Western-style houses on Route Père Robert around No. 356 are connected, forming a straight line. The victim, Yan Ruling, was being held by the bandits on the third floor. After the detectives arrived at their destination, some of them scattered and ambushed to prevent escape, while the others bravely went forward, holding guns in their hands to defend themselves. Sure enough, as they went up the stairs, the bandits were alerted and opened fire downwards, like a string of pearls. Fortunately, the detectives had bulletproof vests to protect themselves. They advanced while firing, charging straight into the victim's room, driving back the bandits guarding the victim, and safely rescuing Yan Ruling. During this operation, the detectives and bandits fired no less than eighty shots, without injuring anyone, which was indeed fortunate.</p>
<p>Four Bandits Arrested: While the detectives were rescuing the victim from the hail of bullets, they arrested four kidnappers. The accents of the bandits were inconsistent, including Cantonese, Ningbo, and Shanghai. They were mostly wearing short clothes. Three of them had pistols in their hands. Because they were resisting the detectives, all the bullets had been fired, and they had no choice but to surrender. A total of three pistols were seized, one of which was a Mauser pistol.</p>
<p>Encounter in the Bandit Den: The victim, Yan Ruling, is 62 years old this year. He is usually quite energetic. Since entering the bandit den, his life has been greatly affected. According to his own account, the treatment by the bandits was very harsh. He was only given a salted egg for each meal. There were three or four guards watching him. One, who looked like a bandit leader, often came to look around. A few days ago, he suddenly said to Yan, "The situation is not good now. There may be some difficulties for you. I hope you don't mind." His words implied that he might tear up the hostage. Fortunately, the French Patrol exerted great effort in the arrest, and he was able to turn danger into safety. When the detectives entered the room, the guard was holding a gun in his hand, firing at the door. Yan was greatly shocked and covered his head with a quilt to protect himself. It was not until the kidnappers were arrested that he felt a little more clear-headed. Recalling the past, he was still fearful.</p>

<p>The Owner Severely Injured</p>
<p>Chen Boluo from Sidong Township, Pudong, runs the Xiehe Grocery Store on Yong'an Street in Shanghai. In recent years, his business has been thriving and very profitable. Therefore, he purchased forty or fifty acres of land in his hometown and built a new house. The day before yesterday, when the new house was completed, Chen's family moved in and prepared a banquet, inviting relatives and friends to his home for a feast. In the evening, after the banquet ended, the relatives and friends dispersed. However, the relatives and friends from Shanghai all stayed overnight. Suddenly, in the middle of the night, many bandits broke into the house and rushed into Chen's room to search, breaking open the boxes. More than 300 yuan and gold jewelry and clothing were robbed, packed into two bundles. They then went to the rooms of the relatives and friends in the next room and searched everyone, taking all the silver dollars. Chen's nephew, Yu, resisted when the bandits were searching him. He was stabbed four or five times in the arm and back, and was severely injured. Chen was sent to the hospital for treatment and reported to the authorities for investigation. However, Yu's injuries were very serious, so yesterday Chen sent Yu to Shanghai Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese Grain Merchants Association, in order to ensure the safety of its members in foreign rice futures trading, requires both parties to pay a security deposit for each transaction. Yesterday, the association issued a notice to its members stating: "Recently, rice prices have been expensive, and foreign rice transactions have been frequent. Members bear a heavy burden in trading. In order to ensure the safety of its members, the association has revised the regulations for regular foreign rice trading. For new transactions on April 1, each party must pay a security deposit of 1,000 taels per 100 tons. Alternatively, if buying back, the member can submit the association's security deposit transaction sheet for verification and approval to avoid paying the security deposit again. The security deposit will be paid by the trading members themselves into a reliable money house, and the receipt will be sent to the association for registration. The security deposit will be returned when the original account is settled, with the association and the payer both stamping their seals on the receipt. The association will not accept transactions that have not been registered and had security deposits paid in the event of disputes. Regarding transactions prior to April 1, regardless of profit or loss, the security deposit will only be returned after the goods have been delivered and the procedures have been completed. The above measures were decided by the association's staff meeting and will be strictly implemented from April 1.

<p>Longhua Temple in the southwestern suburbs of the city is a famous ancient temple in Shanghai, containing more than 10,000 volumes of Ming and Qing dynasty scriptures and a bronze Buddha from the Jin dynasty, all of which are historical relics. Next to it is a seven-story pagoda built during the Tang Guan Zong period. The surrounding countryside is full of peach orchards. Every spring, when the peach blossoms are in full bloom, tourists come and go, and the roads are congested. Currently, because troops are stationed in the temple, it is feared that counter-revolutionary elements may infiltrate, so, except for pilgrims, no one is allowed to enter the temple to worship. The merchants and residents of the town are panicked, and temporary operators during the pilgrimage season are even more uneasy. Therefore, they repeatedly asked Battalion Commander Lin Zengding to open the temple to allow people to visit and maintain their livelihoods. In order to take care of business, Battalion Commander Lin agreed to be flexible and organized a temporary patrol team to patrol back and forth. The Sixth District Second Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Caoging District Defense Corps also sent many police officers to the site to take care of matters. The Shanghai South Bus opened special buses, which were especially convenient. Yesterday, the number of tourists reached more than 5,000.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Liu Cuilian Sues to Dissolve Adoptive Daughter Relationship <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Liu Achun from Baoshan, a coppersmith, lived in Jiangxun Town. Years ago, he adopted Cui Lian, the daughter of his friend Xu Meisheng, as his adopted daughter, renaming her Liu Cuilian. The woman is now nineteen years old. Shen Kuilin, who lives in the Lajiao Bridge area (a Chongming native, twenty-two years old, working as a runner in the Gonghe Dyeing Workshop in Jiangwan Town), repeatedly seduced the woman. The woman has weak knowledge and was deceived by him. On February 6 of this year, Shen seduced the woman and had sex with her. The next day, her adoptive mother, Liu Zengshi (Achun's wife), found her. On the tenth of the same month, Shen seduced her again and took her to the Dongxin Bridge Hotel for more fun. The next day, Shen hid Cuilian. Later, Liu Zengshi found Shen and took him to the Fifth District Police Station, who transferred him to the District Court Prosecutor's Office. He confessed to the truth and was indicted. Liu Zengshi also filed an incidental civil lawsuit, requesting that Shen Kuilin be ordered to return Liu Cuilian, etc. Later, the Criminal Court tried the case and ruled that Shen Kuilin was guilty of repeatedly intending to commit adultery and enticing a woman under the age of twenty. He should be punished in accordance with Articles 75, 257, Paragraph 2, and 64 of the Criminal Law, sentenced to one year of imprisonment, and ordered to return Liu Cuilian to Liu Zengshi for collection. Unexpectedly, Liu Cuilian hired Lawyer Yao Jian to draft a document and petition the District Court to dissolve her adoptive relationship with Liu Achun and Liu Zengshi. The wording stated that she had been repeatedly abused by her adoptive parents, because her adoptive mother had each of their own biological children. She was treated differently. When someone came to propose marriage to the plaintiff, the defendants, Liu Achun and his wife, always demanded a dowry of a thousand gold, similar to a buying and selling marriage, and wanted to place the plaintiff in the position of a concubine. The plaintiff did not get what she wanted, so she was frequently beaten and forced to leave home. She is seeking to dissolve her adoptive relationship and seek autonomy in marriage. The defendants, Liu Achun and Liu Zengshi, also hired Lawyer Lu Qi to submit a defense. The case was opened for trial but remained unresolved. The day before yesterday, Judge Ge Zhitan opened the trial for continued hearing. The plaintiff, Liu Cuilian, did not arrive due to illness, and her agent, Lawyer Yao, appeared in court and requested a postponement of two weeks. The defendant, Lawyer Lu, objected, stating that the plaintiff's age has not reached the period of marriage autonomy. The judge then summoned the defendant, Liu Zengshi, to the court for a brief interrogation, and then summoned Xu Yangshi to the court for testimony. Xu stated that she was 54 years old, from Changzhou, and lived on Dongshatan. Liu Cuilian is my own daughter, nineteen years old this year. When Cuilian was just over a month old, I sent her to Liu Achun's house for adoption because I had many children. The Liu family loves Cuilian very much. She is young and easily deceived. Q. Why is your husband Xu Meisheng not here today? A. He returned to his hometown because of something. Please, Your Honor, do not summon me next time, because I am very busy at home. The judge found that Cuilian's claim and her biological mother's, Xu Yangshi's, claims are not consistent. Therefore, there is no legal representative for the case. The defendant should apply to appoint a special agent. The judge ordered the trial to be continued.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Relief Requests from Two Counties in Anhui Province <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Chao County: The Shanghai Foreign Charitable Relief Society received a letter of request for relief from the Chao County People's Food Relief Committee of Anhui, listed below.  Privately, our county has experienced months without rain since last spring, extending into autumn.  Reservoirs and weirs have dried up, and springs have ceased flowing.  All elevated fields have not been planted.  Even the small number of polder fields which could be irrigated with effort, after planting were then ravaged by locusts and grasshoppers, resulting in a complete loss of harvest for both elevated and polder fields.  The entire county has become a disaster area.  On top of the devastation of famine, a massive catastrophe has followed, with wounds and sores visible everywhere, and mournful cries resounding throughout the land. The strong have gone to other places to find food, while the old and weak await death. Selling wives and children is heard of daily, and people are consuming tree leaves and grass roots as if they were delicacies. The severity of the disaster is truly unprecedented in a century. We were fortunate to receive an emergency allocation of 2,000 yuan from the Anhui Provincial Relief Committee, and our association has also raised a small amount of funds. However, there are too many disaster victims to distribute the aid effectively. We have only been able to set up porridge kitchens to provide immediate relief. But how can a cup of water extinguish a burning cart of firewood? Consequently, many people have died from hunger and cold in recent months. Now, although the harsh winter has passed, the spring famine has arrived. The disaster victims are crying out for food, barely clinging to life. If we do not continue to raise relief funds, the tragic situation will become even more unbearable.</p>
<p>Langxi:  The Shanghai Chinese Jisheng Society recently received a report from Wang Jingzhou and Wu Huinan, representatives of Langxi County in southern Anhui province.  They stated that the county suffered from banditry, warfare, wind, drought, and insect plagues in previous years, resulting in a complete loss of crops.  Last winter and this spring, continuous rain and snow have caused the freezing death of vegetables and wheat, making the spring harvest hopeless.  Two hundred thousand lives are barely clinging to existence and desperately hope for rescue.  They also brought a letter from the county magistrate.  The society inquired about the situation in detail and found it to be extremely dire.</p>

<p>A:  Is it dangerous?</p>
<p>B:  How can it not be?  Look at my old uncle, who is sixty years old and widowed for a long time.  Last year, he dyed his beard and hair black, pretending to be young.  And then, a widow insisted on marrying him, even dragging along three oil bottles (children).</p>
<p>A:  Old friend, I beg you to lend me a hand.</p>

<h3 id="e232">The Interesting History of Gold Teeth <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Lv Bing</p>
<p>Some say that the trend of gold teeth has become popular recently and its origins are not very distant. In fact, after research, it was found that German goldsmiths were already able to perform this technique three hundred years ago. The Monigan Medical Weekly also published an interesting anecdote about the first discovery of gold teeth based on historical records, which is quite entertaining and can be used as a conversation starter after dinner.</p>
<p>In the year 1593 AD, a German farmer had a son named Muller, who was only eight years old, and one of his teeth shone like gold. At the time, those who saw it were amazed. As the news spread, it actually attracted the attention of the medical community. Therefore, Dr. Hostede, a professor of pharmacy at Hanmusi Dan University, specially examined the child's tooth. As a result, it was determined to be a natural gold tooth, and he published his opinion in Latin, which was later translated into German, causing a stir in society and regarding it as a new discovery. According to the superstitious ideas of most Germans, it was even said that the gold tooth was a sign from God, proving that God was still among the German people. Muller was not satisfied and took the opportunity to present himself to the public, exposing his brilliant tooth for people to see, in order to gain great benefits. Unexpectedly, after a while, white spots began to appear in the middle of the gold tooth, causing many to doubt. After further examination, it was discovered that the natural gold tooth was actually artificially plated. With the truth revealed, Muller was arrested and eventually convicted by the government for deceiving the public and extorting money.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Interesting Records of Jiaotong University's 34th Anniversary (Part 1) <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>The renowned Jiaotong University, established in the 22nd year of the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty by Sheng Xuanhuai, has now existed for thirty-four years. Although its name has been changed and its departments have been slightly altered, its consistent spirit of advancement has not been diminished in the slightest. Since Sun Zhesheng took over as the head of the school, the interior has been greatly renovated, and it has become more prosperous and energetic. The other day (the 28th) was the school's 34th anniversary. Coinciding with the completion of the new dormitory "Zhixin West Studio," two major events were held at the same time, and the men's and women's dormitories were opened for public viewing. There are many noteworthy things that happened during this time. I will record what I remember and tell the readers.</p>
<p>Splendid and Beautiful: Before the event, the school authorities specially formed a preparatory committee to carry out all the preparations in order to be serious. All the arrangements were very impressive. For example, at the entrance, in addition to the party and national flags, there were also cypress branches and fresh flowers tied into colorful patterns. There was also a long couplet hanging that said "Tracing the reputation spread all over the world, grandly talented thousands of generations, is the highest school in the southeast, counting the years thirty-four weeks" which was also made with art. In addition, the clock tower was decorated with electric lights and the flagpole was covered with bright lights, all of which were ingenious and very interesting, exhausting the ability to be gorgeous.</p>
<p>An Anecdote of Zhu Zhixin: At eleven o'clock, the Zhixin West Studio completion ceremony was held. Bao Yangxingfu and many Westerners arrived. First, Li Zhaohuan gave a speech, stating the greatness of the school's future plans. This is just the beginning. Then, Liang Hancao, a counselor representing the Ministry of Railways, was invited to talk about the deeds of Mr. Zhu Zhixin (Zhixin West Studio is to commemorate Mr. Zhu). Liang said that Martyr Zhu was extremely intelligent. His mathematics all came from ancient Chinese books. He could immediately obtain the multiplication of three or four digits. When he was in Japan, he studied politics and economics, but his mathematics was more precise than those who specialized in this field. Whenever he encountered difficult problems, he would ask Martyr Zhu to answer them. And he could know the meaning of secret code telegrams without checking. His talent was beyond the reach of ordinary people. However, when the martyr was in Japan, he kept a braid and refused to cut it. Even though Hu Zhantang urged him again and again, he would refuse sternly. He would rather die than obey. Some people who knew the reason said it was his aunt's parting instruction. However, at the beginning of the revolution, many party members could not operate openly because they had no braids. He was the only one who could do it. From this, we can know the depth of his intentions. After the speech, Li and Liang unveiled the name, and the four characters of Zhixin West Studio written by Hu Hanmin appeared before our eyes.</p>
<p>The Flower Garden in Front of the Studio: There is a flower garden recently built on the vacant land in front of the studio. A lotus pond is built in the center, and the surroundings are all grassland. The green grass is spread flat, and the shadows of the flowers are swaying. Sitting by the stream is like being in a French park. It is truly a beautiful place.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Hu Hanmin of Shen Zhi's Account of the March 29th Uprising <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Qian</p>
<p>Hu Zhantang, the current speaker of the Legislative Yuan, was actually one of the important figures in the tumultuous March 29th Uprising nineteen years ago. In the uprising's organization, Hu was elected as the head of the secretariat. The morning after the seventy-two martyrs died for their cause, Hu and Zhao went to the appointed location with their team. Knowing that the event had failed, they each returned to Hong Kong and reported the beginning and end of the uprising to the overseas Chinese. The documents reporting the beginning and end of the uprising to the overseas Chinese were drafted by Hu and Huang. His younger brother, Yi Sheng, was also a leader in the uprising's assault and served as a revolutionary comrade in the command of the advancing general at the time.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Nightly Ramblings <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Sha's Tear Stains</p>
<p>For ten years, I have been trapped in the factory, consumed by mechanical life. The situation is no different from an ox pushing a millstone, with its eyes covered to prevent it from looking around, and running wildly with all its strength. On quiet nights, thinking calmly, I often laugh dumbly and feel sadly. Especially during the long nights, amidst the rattling of the machinery, supervising those bumpkin commoners, country girls, to work hard until dawn, is the most desolate. This kind of life with night as day is as difficult as an ox and as stealthy as a rat. Alas, the plan for food and clothing must burden people so much. Why should I bear this round head and step on this square foot and seek to be a human being?</p>
<p>In the past, the cotton spinning technique in our country was only practiced by rural women. They worked diligently under the lamp at night, laboring to the extreme. What they gained was nothing more than inches of silk, which was not enough to keep one person warm. After the invention of the spinning machine, people invested millions and employed thousands of workers to operate a factory day and night, without rest in the cold or heat. The yarn and cloth produced in one day is more than enough to keep thousands of people warm. Logically speaking, the people's livelihood should be abundant. How can one know that decline and difficulty are still not as good as the past? Ah, Tagore's words say, "I wish the Chinese people would keep simplicity and return to the truth, and always maintain their poverty. Do not pursue the material civilization of others." Carefully savoring these words, are there not deep meanings?</p>
<p>Among the workers in the cotton mills at sea, women account for seven or eight out of ten. They all come from the fields of Jiangnan and Jiangbei. Most of them are young girls and young women, followed by young girls, and then old women. Why do they abandon their life in the countryside (comfortable and natural) and come to this city to live this cattle-horse life without grieving for their suffering? The money environment drives them to do so.</p>
<p>Among the female workers in the yarn factory, those in the fine yarn section are the most splendid. Occasionally, I see some who are dressed in simple skirts and thorn hairpins, with graceful figures. Because they do night work and have no sleep at night, their peach-like faces are like a layer of yellow wax. Those with plump charm are truly like Wang Xifeng as described by Cao Xueqin, while those who are thin and weak are like Lin Daiyu. Others, such as those with plump faces and rich hair like Pan Xueyan, and those who dance nimbly like Li Minghui, are all described by those who like to compare them and given nicknames. The Orioles and Swallows are truly countless. When colleagues are working until midnight and are tired and sleepy, if they use a pen to compare them, they often learn that the fragrant atmosphere attacks people, and the sleeping demons avoid them by three homes.</p>
<p>Female workers with slightly better looks are mostly in a bad environment and cannot free themselves. Because of work needs in the factory, they often have to be controlled by the machine repairmen, adding oil, etc. When they get outside the factory, there is a group of rogue playboys who intimidate and deceive them. The arrival of a bad environment is enough to shake their hearts and they cannot be autonomous. Therefore, they do not find the practices of Sangjian and Pusang strange. Even in Japan, where the textile industry is most developed, once a woman enters a yarn factory as a female worker, her lifelong happiness is over. Therefore, female yarn factory workers are very despised in the current situation in China and Japan.</p>
<p>Acknowledgments: The newly published "Lament of the Mandarin Ducks" novel by Gu Mingdao of Yixin Bookstore. The content and plot are very compact, with both chivalry and mourning. Gu's novels have long been famous in the literary world, and this book is his masterpiece. I received a copy yesterday, so I would like to express my gratitude here and introduce it.</p>

<p>— Lai</p>
<p>The next day, many people from the theater world came to watch. All recognized it as true art and expressed great admiration. Therefore, in the following days, the streets and alleys were full of discussions, with Mei's opera as the sole topic. The name "Mei Lanfang" resonated even more in people's ears. The original plan was to perform for only two weeks, but from the opening day, tickets for both weeks were sold out. It is intended not to change the repertoire during these two weeks. According to foreigners, there is no need to change it for three months. Recently, people have been asking when "Yang Guifei" will be performed, but the troupe members insist on not changing the repertoire for the time being, and the theater owner agrees.</p>
<p>The other day, a letter came from the embassy saying that the President wanted to meet Wan Hua and asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs to speak to our country's ambassador, requesting an introduction. He asked if it would be possible to perform in Washington again. This is currently being negotiated. As for whether to perform in other major cities, this is also being negotiated. Columbia University also invited him to perform, strongly suggesting that they could sell out the venue. This is related to status and will have to be considered for a performance in the future.</p>
<p>The other day, a concert was held to welcome Wan Hua. The participants were all playwrights, singers, and musicians, totaling over 300 people. Wan Hua gave a speech, mainly saying that it is easiest to connect the feelings of the people of two countries through fine arts and art, and it is easy to gain good impressions. (The whole audience applauded loudly.) This time in the United States, he wants to study American art to prepare to return to his motherland and make contributions. Subsequently, the president of the association replied, saying that if Mr. Mei wants to gain some art in the United States to bring back to his country, in fact, as a result, Mr. Mei must leave some art in the United States. The whole audience applauded loudly. In the past few days, there have been several welcome parties, too numerous to describe in detail. Photography studios have also asked people to introduce themselves for photography several times a day.</p>
<p>More than a dozen literary giants in New York have come to visit and talk. For example, Stark Young is one of the great writers and a highly acclaimed critic. He occasionally writes his own scripts. He has published one or two reviews of Mei's opera in newspapers. (This person's theater reviews are freely expressed opinions and not for profit.) He came to visit and talk today, which shows his attention to Chinese opera. A summary of his comments is as follows.</p>

<p>Chapter Ten: Red Flames Soar, the Balcony Praises the Filial Daughter; Red Carpet Spread, Meet Famous Actors on the Spot</p>
<p>Zuo Shichen said, "So that's how it is." A Jin said, "No wonder, it's no wonder she acts like that. Eating this bowl of 'broken life' singer's rice, people look at her and think she's quite carefree. But there's no free time at all. A-Nan has wanted to see a play for a long time. That day, when she was talking excitedly, young master Ye said, 'A-Nan, I'll take you to see a play on Saturday. Because it's not good to sleep too late on other days. It doesn't matter if you sleep a little later on Saturday.' When she heard about seeing a play, of course, she couldn't be happier, and she agreed immediately. But her mother only thinks about the business side of things. She thinks that letting go of a singer is losing a dollar, but it makes that child feel no relief at all." Zuo Shichen said, "Just for such a small thing? I'll take her to see a play in a few days." He Jin said, "According to her wishes, it would be best to see a whole night of opera completely. Not to sing even one performance. How is that possible?" Zuo Shichen said, "Okay, I'll think of a way to let her comfortably see to her heart's content. But I can only manage one night. I'll be fully responsible for this one night. If it's more than that, the eldest aunt will start gossiping." Just as they were talking there, Ruiyun came out of the pavilion and said, "What are you talking about?" A Jin said, "Second Young Master said he wants to take you to see a play." Ruiyun pursed her lips and said, "What are you teasing me for? You know I don't have the good fortune to see a play, but you deliberately try to tempt me." A Jin said, "Second Young Master said he's taking you to see a play sincerely and earnestly. Naturally, he'll explain it to the eldest aunt. She'll at least give Second Young Master some face." Ruiyun shook her head and said, "I'm not going. I'm not happy." Zuo Shichen said, "Why aren't you going? I'm inviting you, but you're not willing to honor me with your presence. Young master Ye invited you, and you happily agreed." Ruiyun's face turned red and said, "It's not like that. That kind of play is always unsatisfying. Just when it's getting good, suddenly the performance comes. It's like a messenger of death. That ticket is like a soul-snatching ticket. There are even a series of circles added to the ticket. If you're a little late in leaving the performance, you'll be scolded again when you return. What's the point of that? If young master Ye hadn't invited me, I would have turned him down too. Why do you say things like 'honor me with your presence'?" Zuo Shichen said, "Now there's a new troupe of new plays. They've just returned from Japan. They're not professional actors. They're several students. When they're happy, they get together a dozen people and organize a drama club called Qing Liu She. I know several people inside. They're going to have their premiere in a few days. On the day of the premiere, they'll definitely send me tickets. I thought that on that day, I'd invite you to go and see it together. As for the eldest aunt's side, I'll explain it to her. Even if she's unwilling in her heart, she'll have to give me some face. That's why I asked you if you'd honor me with your presence. But you unexpectedly said you wouldn't go. I ran into a brick wall."</p>

<h3 id="e241">The Discount Amount in March is Only Nine Qian <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>The Deposit Interest is Roughly 2.95%</p>
<p>This year, due to the relationship between expensive gold and cheap silver, the market is flooded with silver funds. The use of funds is uneven due to the sluggish market, and the market atmosphere has been sluggish for a long time. The daily silver discount is either borrowed for free or several fen, and it has never reached one qian. Therefore, the silver discount in March was very low, totaling only nine qian. The pull-off on the 31st accounted for only 2.903% per day, which shows the looseness of the silver base. The silver base is loose, so the price of deposit interest is difficult to save. Fortunately, there is a rule that at least it should not incline to within two liang of the people. Therefore, the deposit interest rate in March is expected to be around 2.95%.</p>
<h3 id="e242">A Prelude to the Implementation of Abandoning Tael and Changing to Yuan <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>Wanxian and Shashi Have Abolished the Nominal Silver Standard</p>
<p>My country's currency has always been based on silver taels. Although silver dollars have been drummed up for decades, the accumulated habits are difficult to eliminate, and they are still conservative. General old merchants use the flat color to seek private interests. The silver dollars are of uneven quality, and private castings are repeatedly seen, especially leaving people with a solid basis for complaints, and also hindering the abolition of taels and changing to yuan. In recent years, there has been less and less silver in the inland, and cash delivery is only in name. As a result, the bad example of calling out the exchange and drawing accounts of nominal silver has led to silver dollars exceeding the legal price, and the exchange rate has surged accordingly. Very few merchants have profited, and the society has suffered greatly. Shashi, Wanxian, and Chongqing are prominent examples. According to the report of the Shanghai Juxingcheng Bank, the banks in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have tried their best to advocate changing to the foreign yuan standard. Although there were many obstacles, it was not implemented immediately. However, in the past two years, the foreign exchange rate of Shashi Wanxian has become more and more crazy. Many merchants have suffered losses, so they are all shocked and urgently seek reform. In addition to Shashi, which implemented the abolition of tael and yuan last year, Wanxian is now also changing to yuan. The silver taels are all transitioning with 7 qian and 8 fen. After that, there will be no so-called foreign interest, and the exchange rate will gradually stabilize.</p>

<p>(Beiping) The opening price of the front market was 96 current 16675, and the closing price was 166, with sales of 260,000. Salt surplus coupons were 295, with sales of 10,000.

<p>Total Transactions Were Over 7 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's public bond market had a total of 31,000 yuan in spot goods, including 16,000 yuan for aftermath and 14,000 yuan for reorganization, 1,000 yuan for finance, and no market for other bonds. The forward market was generally still good, and buying and selling continued to be vigorous. The pre-market reached about 2 million, and the afternoon exceeded 4 million. Among them, tariffs were still the most active in the market, accounting for 2.9 million yuan, and the aftermath was also still good, accounting for more than 1.4 million yuan. Reorganization accounted for about 1 million yuan, continuation volume accounted for 800,000 yuan, and the whole six accounted for less than 500,000 yuan. The others were clear. There was no market for 96 throughout the day, and the disarmament, which had not been traded for a long time, suddenly opened at 30,000 yuan. Due to the slightly tense situation, people's hearts turned slightly weak, and the selling transaction was much more prosperous than last week, and the bond price dropped quite sharply. The forward goods such as tariff reorganization fell by about 1.7 yuan, and the continuation volume and aftermath also fell by about 1 yuan. However, the trend of other bonds was very peaceful, and the opening price of the reorganization spot goods in the early morning was the only one that continued to rise.</p>

<p>The yarn market was flat in the morning and fell in the afternoon, and the situation was very weak. The bottom goods were gradually thicker, the sellers' momentum was stronger, the pressure was stronger, and the buyers were difficult to support. The downward trend was fierce, and the market situation was getting worse and worse. However, the overseas flower and yarn market continued to rise consistently. Most of the sellers of yarn this month have to look at the price of 45 or 6 liang, so the market atmosphere is even worse. Some people think that there may be a spin due to the recent sharp decline, but it is not easy to reverse the situation with the daily sales.</p>
<p>Near-Month Yarn Falls Another Two and a Half Weak, the opening price of the manual standard in the pre-market was strong for the American flower three products, and the people's hearts in the commercial market were still stable. The retail investors made up for the short positions, and each month rose by one, two, three, four, and five qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that a yarn number of the Sichuan Gang was stranded, and the people's hearts were greatly empty, and the selling atmosphere was strong. Each month fell suddenly by one, two, five qian. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 17,200 packages. The closing price of the manual standard is recorded on the left:</p>

<p>Tianjin Gang Handles Futures Japanese Yarn: The sales of spot goods are still flat, but the transaction of Tianjin entering futures Japanese yarn is still prosperous. It is found that the statistics of each gang buying futures and spot yarn throughout the day are 1,700 packages, and 175 packages are entered in the industry. The market fell by 5 qian. Among the guest gangs, Guangdong has the strongest appetite, with 325 packages. Tianjin entered futures and spot goods for a total of 670 packages. In addition, Shantou has 115 packages, inland 90 packages, Sichuan 45 packages, Wuhu 40 packages, Niuzhuang 55 packages, Jiangxi 60 packages, and miscellaneous gangs 200 packages.</p>

<p>The cotton market is still firm. The overseas cotton market is rising. The American cotton weekly report says that there is a squeeze on the May period. This cotton lacks sources and the bottom goods are not thick. The cheap Indian cotton from the previous day is now priced firmly, so the future of the cotton market is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>The Price of Futures Cotton rose in the morning but fell back later. In the pre-market of the Han standard, the overseas cotton rose, causing retail investors to dig up and rise by one qian and five fen to two qian. In the afternoon, the spot yarn market fell sharply, and the people's hearts were slightly soft. Each month fell back by five fen to one qian. The total transaction for the whole day was 289,900 dan. The closing price of the Han standard is recorded on the left: Han standard closing price increase or decrease account number closing price increase or decrease account number April 34.75 Up 10 70,000 July 34.70 Up 10 65,600</p>

<p>The spot demand is still not lonely, the spot cotton business is still good, and the price of each source is difficult to be cheap. The port source is calculated to be 2,800 packages of Tonghua. The sales record is left:</p>
<p>Taicang Flower 35.50 Chongxin Factory Entered 1,000 Packages of Spot Goods Delivered to the Factory</p>

<p>Bombay: The market situation last week was calm with little fluctuation. The market momentum was slightly weak due to fears of the Broach delivery and waiting for the confirmation of the cotton industry protection bill. Spot exports were still good. Mainland exporters heavily purchased Oomra cotton. Southern cotton picking has started to move, and the cotton quality is satisfactory, but arrivals are not abundant. Manufacturers are quite active. If the protection bill passes, it will develop further. The statistics for the past week are appended below (in units of thousands of bales):</p>
<p>Previous Week 　　　　　Last Week</p>
<p>Cumulative receipts since September 1st 　2,474 　　　2,546</p>
<p>Weekend inventory 　　　　　　　　1,298 　　　1,287</p>

<p>Liverpool: After a period of brisk sales last week, the spot market gradually calmed down. Futures trading was not active, and the market situation was also mixed. It was flat and weak at the beginning of the week, but strengthened at the weekend due to a lack of sellers and purchases by traders at the end of the month. The demand for Egyptian cotton varies with market price fluctuations.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Food: The Rice Market in the Lower Reaches of the River is Almost at a Standstill <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>High-grade Japonica rice is being transferred to other ports... Medium-grade Japonica rice is selling well in the Southern Market</p>
<p>Zhabei: The market was extraordinarily quiet yesterday, with the source of supply cut off. However, the Northern Japonica rice of upper, middle, and high grades, which had been stockpiled in the river region, suddenly completely opened up, either going to the Southern Market or returning north. As a result, there were fewer than thirty cargo ships remaining in the Zhabei market, and they were carrying middle and lower-grade goods. The quoted price was uniformly 20 yuan. As for the goods beyond the 20 yuan price point outside the customs, it can be said that not a single grain remained. This desolate scene was no different from the end of the year. The supply of Bo Dao and Yang Du Jian rice was also small. Although the appetites of the various shops were good, they did not dare to purchase rashly due to environmental reasons. Therefore, the entire day's market was very calm, and there were no clear rules for any price increases or decreases. Although Bai Yuan rice had a beautiful color, it is also very rare now, and the market is stagnant.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: The source of supply from the river region is also scarce, with only a portion of the South Road goods and a portion of the Zhabei returned goods. This makes the Japonica rice price here lively. Although it is the same limited price of 20 yuan, the high grade is ultimately determined by the thoughts and vision of the buyer. There is no indication of high grade on the goods themselves. The sales in the main streets of both the North and South markets are quite strong, and neither dares to purchase goods beyond the limited price. Therefore, due to cost reasons, cargo owners are transferring their goods to other ports in succession. As a result, the market situation in Shanghai is very quiet. The Soo Tung-gang machine-milled rice arrived in response to the situation and is at the highest limited price point. However, even though it has reached a lofty price, no further batches have arrived. The sales of Bo Dao and early rice from the Southern Road are brisk and disappear by evening, and the prices are firm. Yang Du Xian rice is also very rare now. Although foreign rice has flooded the market, sales are extremely smooth. Both local and out-of-town merchants are competing to purchase it, and the trend is extraordinarily lively. There is no price increase or decrease, and the buying sentiment is brisk and the market is firm. The overall rice situation for the day is increasingly pessimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Foreign Rice: Current Price is Flat, Futures Price is Falling <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, because of the continued arrival and sale of new foreign rice, the spot market was still buoyant. The unified market only offered one lot of 500 bags of Saigon rice at a price of 15.70 to 15.65 yuan, 1,000 bags of small grain rice at a price of 15.00 to 14.82 yuan, 500 bags of Min Dang rice at a price of 15.33 yuan, and 1,000 bags of large grain rice at a price of 14.60 yuan. All were cheaper than the previous market. And there are still arrivals expected daily, so the market will likely not see another surge in prices. Although the foreign rice firms did not make large sales of futures rice, the sentiment in the market has stabilized. Because the foreign firms sold a very large amount of April-May contracts last year and this year, these April-May contracts will soon expire, and some importers are planning to sell back the contracts, so the volume of buy-back transactions is more than the volume of new transactions. Yesterday, the unified market opened with more than 3,000 tons, and the price fell by a small 0.07-0.08 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e250">The March Wheat Flour Delivery <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>Only 50,000 bags of warehouse receipts were delivered</p>
<p>The total number of wheat flour deliveries for March was still only 50,000 bags, all of which were "Three Star" brand from the Zhonghua Mill. All other mills settled privately beforehand or were withdrawn by brokers, so no bags were delivered. Of the buyers, about half were reportedly bought by a certain large mill, and the other half were bought by local merchants, or rolled over into the next month. In fact, very few brokers were involved. Given the current low inventory of various mills, the opening price for the next month may have to be a bit higher. Since the mills' attitudes are inconsistent, squeezing may be inevitable. The total volume of futures transactions was slightly higher than last month. A list is provided below (in units of thousands of bags):</p>

<p>Glutinous rice branches are a specialty of Guangdong, with a sweet and fragrant taste. In previous years, the market price has always been above 100 taels. Last autumn, due to more local produce, it once dropped to a minimum of over 60 taels. This spring, it rose slightly. Recently, due to low inventory and increasing scarcity, it is rising again. The market price in the top shops is already close to 80 taels, more than 10 taels higher than the low price.</p>

<p>Local cotton cloth: The trend has been steadily rising recently, likely due to the sharp rise in American cotton and the rare shortage of spot goods from the mills. The sales of fine cloth and fine twill are indeed uncommon. Yesterday, the price continued to rise by 0.025 yuan. Especially the Yang He fine twill is the most expensive, already at 0.705 yuan. Yesterday, the Guangdong brokers transacted 150 pieces. The demand from Shantou, Ningbo, and inland brokers is also high, resulting in insufficient spot goods for distribution. The situation for Blue Double Fish is slightly slower. The movement of coarse cloth for military uniforms has slightly improved. Yesterday, over 200 pieces of Shuangying, Magou, etc. were purchased at 13 pounds. The local brokers are actively searching for Ewo bleached cloth, and over 50 pieces were transacted at the guild.</p>
<p>East-West Piece Goods: The soaring gold price has affected the market for several days, coupled with two days of holiday, with little improvement. However, yesterday, the market suddenly became active. The opening prices of Eastern goods all rose sharply. The Yang Hong Biao all rose by 0.05 yuan, with 6-pound Guo Ju opening at 3.875 taels and 4-pound opening at 3.175 taels. The Hui Guang Xie rose by 0.05 yuan, with Zijing Shan opening at 4.50 taels and Ke Ai Mei Ren opening at 4.475 taels. The rise in Yuan Yang yarn was even more severe, with Dian Qiu Xiang requiring 8.30 taels and Mogan Shan requiring 8.20 taels. The spot goods for Lintongguan Western Beauty are all sold out. The sales of Western goods, stripes and poplin, were quite smooth in the local market yesterday, but lower body goods were even smoother. Hao Shi's Qi Gong Tu opened at 0.335 yuan and Gongping's Ba Zhen Tu at 0.39 yuan, and both had sales. The price of white stripe hemp yarn was firmer than before, with Zhong He goods at 0.2775 yuan and De Ji goods at 0.285 yuan. However, both Chong Tiao have fallen into the 0.20 yuan range.</p>

<p>Each piece will have two samples taken... Each bale will have one strip sample taken. The Shanghai Inspection Bureau will begin inspecting exported silk starting today. Therefore, all manufacturers prepared yesterday to pack the silk to be delivered to foreign firms in custom-made canvas bags, sealed with lead seals, and sent them to the Silk Inspection Office for inspection. The Bureau has predetermined to first perform public weight inspections, taking two samples of silk from each piece, with each sample measuring 450 centimeters. One strip sample will be taken from each bale, and the baking inspection will be completed within 14 hours, providing a public weight certificate to be presented for customs inspection and release. Yesterday, the silk market in Shanghai was firm because the European and American demand has not weakened, the price of Japanese silk remained high, the foreign exchange rate strengthened, and European firms had a strong appetite. The Chinese merchants' attitude was increasingly firm. Yesterday, Xinfu and others brought 60 bales of white factory silk into Shanghai, and Dachang and others brought 30 bales of yellow factory silk into Shanghai. The prices were all firm.</p>

<p>Since the Russian firms began purchasing Gong Xi tea in the local tea market last week, there has been no significant improvement in the market. Although the number of Gong Xi tea deals reached is 6,000 to 7,000 chests, the overall purchase price is only 24 to 25 taels, and the Chinese tea merchants are losing no less than 40 taels per dan. Russian firms have not yet expressed interest in Chun Mee green tea and Keemun black tea, and recent telegrams from the British and French markets have stated that inventories are too high and sales are sluggish. Therefore, both Chinese and foreign tea merchants have a lukewarm interest, and all tea warehouses are being cautious about lending money for future new teas.</p>

<p>Thirteen-gauge and eighteen-gauge chimney iron sheets are currently the best-selling products in the market. In the past two or three days, enamel factories have been buying heavily, and local foundries have also been buying a lot. Therefore, over 2,000 bundles were sold in the city, and the market is getting better because inventories are low and arrivals are few. Thirteen-gauge goods are selling for 9.25 taels per dan, and eighteen-gauge goods are opening at 9.15 taels. The actual transactions are most active for eighteen-gauge goods. According to those familiar with the situation, if there are no more arrivals in two or three weeks, the standard price may have to rise again.</p>

<p>(7) A Trip Along the Suzhou Creek</p>
<p>In Shanghai's waterways, besides the Huangpu River, the next most important is Suzhou Creek. There are many docks along the river, and passengers traveling to Shanghai from the Suzhou-Changzhou inland river areas usually disembark at docks like Tianhougong Bridge and Pentanglong Bridge on small steamers or sailboats. Every morning around eight or nine o'clock, before the small steamers depart, the docks are crowded with people of all ages, both men and women. Soon, the whistle blows a few times, and smoky black fumes rise straight from the smokestack onto the shore. The small steamers gradually leave the riverbank and head west, pulling seven or eight boats of various sizes behind them, connected end to end, like a long snake winding along. This is a common sight on Suzhou Creek. When we read in the newspaper about lake bandits robbing small steamers, we cannot help but recall the impression we got along the shores of Suzhou Creek.</p>
<p>Compared to the Huangpu River, Suzhou Creek is naturally far inferior. The Huangpu River is like a large courtyard, with open gates and doors, pleasing to the eye. Suzhou Creek is not like that; it is like a narrow lane behind a stove shed, not only cramped but also carrying a dirty air. Therefore, along the Huangpu River, there are many people strolling with their hands behind their backs, gazing at the river view. The situation along the Suzhou Creek is very different. The stretch between Waibaidu Bridge and Tianhougong Bridge still has some places where one can linger and appreciate, but the further west you go, the more different it becomes. When you reach areas like Tanziwan and Xiaoshadu, it is as if you have left the city, and a desolate, bleak atmosphere permeates both banks, especially the Guangzhao Villa area, where there are few people and ghost lands are neighbors.</p>
<p>The scenery on both sides of the river can be divided into three distinct periods. If we use the bridges spanning the river as a standard, the section west of Waibaidu Bridge and east of Tianhougong Bridge is like a young man, with a lively and cheerful appearance. The architectural scenery on both banks exudes an air of neatness and splendor. The section between Tianhougong Bridge and the Sanban Chang Bridge at the end of Ma Gen Road is the most complex and lively. There are also the most ships on the river. This kind of tiring and endless situation is like a person in middle age, desperately trying to solve their living problems. As for the Sanban Chang Bridge, it is the last bridge on both sides of the Suzhou Creek. West of this, there are no more bridges. You have to use ferries to cross the river. The scenery on both sides becomes more desolate, as if an old man's interest in life is diminishing. In areas like Tanziwan and Xiaoshadu, many people from Jiangbei live on small boats, but these boats never float on the water; they are beached and live close to the shore. These lifeless boats can well represent the general situation of this section of the Suzhou Creek.</p>
<p>The first section of the Suzhou Creek includes Waibaidu Bridge, Libaidu Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, Jiangxi Road Bridge, and Tianhougong Bridge (Henan Road Bridge). The "Bai" character in "Waibaidu Bridge" is probably a corruption of the character "摆". That place also has a name called "Tou Ba". These two words can tell us a little about what the Suzhou Creek was like decades ago. Standing on the bridge and looking east, the water of the Huangpu River flows right under your feet into Suzhou Creek. To the south is the Bund Park, a piece of land forming the enclosure at the intersection of the two rivers. The Western name of Waibaidu Bridge is "Garden Bridge". Bund Park is indeed very relevant. At the base of the bridge, there is indeed a garden dedicated to growing flowers. Standing on the bridge, you can have a panoramic view of it. Among them, a glass flower house is extraordinarily quiet. Against the wall is a natural spring, with water flowing from above into the pool, and green shadows reflected on it, further highlighting the tranquility of the room.</p>
<p>Looking west from the bridge, the nearest is the Erbaidu Bridge. The two banks of the Erbaidu Bridge are also decorated with "leisurely" elements. On the south side, along the river bank, there are often yachts burning gasoline, moored on the river. The inside of the boat is cleaned as clean as a hospital. The old boatmen also reveal a self-respecting attitude. Apart from accompanying their masters on outings, they spend the day cleaning and wiping the boat, so dirt and dust are completely foreign to them. Among the boats entering and exiting Suzhou Creek, some carry passengers, and some tow goods. Nine out of ten boats are bloated. Only the yachts are slender, with well-proportioned bones and flesh, like the young ladies of Suzhou Creek.</p>
<p>Between the Baidu Bridge and the Sichuan Road Bridge, there are churches, hospitals, hotels, movie theaters, and garden shops along the banks. Especially near the Libaidu Bridge on the south bank, the roads are flat, and the scenery is quiet and serene. When the sun is setting, the river breeze blows from the east, stroking people's faces, no less than a walk along the river. The post office at the northern end of the Sichuan Road Bridge is the only important building along the Suzhou Creek. The Commerce Association at Tianhougong Bridge also has its own place. When Tianhougong was reorganized, there were many stalls and astrologers inside. There were also many people who worshipped the gods. Besides the City God Temple and the Red Temple, Tianhougong could be considered the third in line. Now, the front is deserted, not as good as before. This is also a change related to the Suzhou Creek.</p>
<p>Looking at the traffic and pedestrians coming and going from the bridge is almost a unique scenery of the Suzhou Creek. There is an iron frame on the Waibaidu Bridge, crisscrossing and arching high above the bridge. At night, when a streetcar passes over the bridge, looking from afar, the lights from the carriages shine through the gaps, which is very interesting. At night, along the Suzhou Creek, you can also see the spires of the three department stores, towering high in the sky. Looking back east, although there are tall things behind, the lights on the boat are reflected in the water, rippling and swaying. The air on both banks seems to be much quieter, but a motorcycle quickly drives over the bridge, and the quiet air vibrates like the river water.</p>
<h3 id="e260">The Eunuch Sanbao in the Southern Seas YS <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>(10) Sanbao Cave</p>
<p>This was the seventh voyage of Eunuch Sanbao, and also his last trip to the Southern Seas. It was the year 1433. He, along with over twenty thousand soldiers and civilians, sailed in dozens of "Big Eye Chicken" ships towards the Southern Seas.</p>
<p>Once, as these dozens of "Big Eye Chicken" ships were sailing smoothly along, for some reason, a monstrous wave suddenly arose, and the wind began to howl. These dozens of "Big Eye Chicken" ships drifted like cradles in the vast ocean, tossed about by the waves.</p>
<p>At this time, all the soldiers and civilians on those dozens of "Big Eye Chicken" ships were vomiting. They vomited severely, and naturally, they had no strength left. At this point, the capable Eunuch Sanbao could not think of any remedy. This group of pitiful vomiting soldiers and civilians could only lie down in the cradle-like "Big Eye Chicken" ships, "resigned to their fate."</p>
<p>Soon, the waves grew increasingly larger, and the wind became increasingly fierce. At this point, the ships rocked even more violently. The mountain-toppling, sea-overturning rocking only made that group of vomiting soldiers and civilians feel even more intensely miserable.</p>
<p>Even Eunuch Sanbao began to vomit at this time. He could not think of any solution. The thought of "resigning to fate" might have floated into his mind at this point. Therefore, besides lying down, he seemed to be indifferent to everything, as if nothing mattered to him anymore.</p>
<p>The wind and waves grew larger day by day. This was already the third day, and the waves still showed no sign of calming down.</p>
<p>The wind and waves on the fourth day were even more ferocious. These dozens of "Big Eye Chicken" ships, which had originally been sailing together, had already been scattered by the wind and waves. However, those pitiful soldiers and civilians lying in the "Big Eye Chicken" ships were still completely unaware.</p>
<p>On the fifth day, Eunuch Sanbao could no longer endure this suffering, so he began to curse.</p>
<p>"If I still have to suffer such great wind and waves, I would rather die and be done with it!" As soon as he finished speaking, a huge wave overturned his solitary ship. Consequently, the people on board were completely drowned, and the ship slowly sank to the bottom of the sea, it is said.</p>
<p>The day after Eunuch Sanbao's ship sank, the wind and waves actually stopped. Who knew that not far from the location where Eunuch Sanbao's ship sank, there were small, desolate islands?</p>
<p>Time passed like lightning. A month quickly passed. At this time, in a remote part of that desolate island, a cave emerged. That cave, viewed from a distance, looked just like an overturned ship. The cave was overgrown with many strange trees, and those trees hung down like iron chains in a tangled mess. As for this cave, it is said to be Eunuch Sanbao's ship. Later, for some reason, this legend of Sanbao Cave spread among the people in the south.</p>
