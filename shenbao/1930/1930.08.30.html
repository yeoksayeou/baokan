<p>時評</p>
<h3>阿眞廷醖釀革命</h3>
<p>世界大國。對於其殖民自治地及半獨立與名雖獨立而實未離覊絆之國。莫不慮其勢力之浸盛。而喜其國内之多事。乘内部政變風潮。以因緣取利。實爲其侵略最有效之手段。而美國對於中南美各小國。當然亦不能在此例外。前日秘魯發生革命。秘國民黨欣然視爲脫離美國勢力之進一步。而吾即謂其過誇者。正以此種内亂革命。敬非眞心爲國者則實爲大國造侵略機會而非爲本國造獨立機會也。今秘魯之革命未已而阿眞廷又突起内閧。羣以繼起革命爲慮矣。夫阿眞廷爲美洲最大之農業國。工業亦漸發達。自與巴西智利同盟後。政治亦漸革新。可稱爲美洲平穩進步之一國惟阿眞廷在歐戰後。民族運動之之潮流中。已隱然成爲中南美反美派之領袖。而爲美國所不喜。一旦有何舉動。必爲美國所甚注意者也。今其内閧。或謂爲勞工觖望或謂爲防軍人政治活動。尙未得其詳情。阿在中南美。雖可稱爲小康。但因其擴張軍備。經濟亦不甚充裕。使其所謂革命者。亦僅如秘魯軍人與黨派之競爭。則其結果。又豈阿人之幸乎。吾有以觀其後矣。</p>

<h3>扶輪杯决賽第一日</h3>
<p>中華勝英國兩單打</p>
<p>林寳華邱飛海均是直落獲勝</p>
<p>今日下午四時中華與英作雙打賽</p>
<p>上海萬國網球扶輪杯賽、昨爲中英逐鹿錦標之第一日、雖隔夜秋雨旁沱、幸昨晨即能放晴、直至下午四時、塲地漸乾、比賽得照常進行、且秋風送爽、炎威頓消、觀者踴躍蒞至、不下六七百人、賽員精神、亦極興奮、惟草地略濕、球性失去彈力、且五分量加重、實爲减色不少、然競爭形勢、依然緊張、尤以林賽華對惠特之戰、最爲劇烈、兩組單打、吾國全勝、均爲直落三之成續云、</p>
<p>六丨三</p>
<p>（一）杯寳華（中）六丨四　惠特（英）</p>
<p>六丨二</p>
<p>林寳華與江道章蒞場最早、先作練習、直至四時三刻、英國惠特跚跚入場、稍舒筋骨後、林惠即開始比賽、</p>
<h3>第一盤　惠地特開球、用力猛抽、取勝首局</h3>
<p>林乃藉其準急之發球、及遠近裕如、銳不可擋之抽球、使惠特不暇奔命、觀衆大爲興趣、乘聲大起、遂亦還敬一局、後惠特發球、屢次失誤、林加上一局、以二比一占先第四局林發球、竟以滑四失敗、出人意料、蓋林素以發球擅長也、至此、乃成各二局比、嗣後林精神振作、得心應手、連取兩局、惠特使勁反攻、板回一局、後林又得兩局、以六比三勝第一盤、</p>
<h3>第二盤　林藉發球取勝首局、惠特憑其</h3>
<p></p>
<p>其多年的經騐、時有出色表演、正手抽球甚佳、惜正手球缺少把握、仍無建樹、第三局惠特亦以凈四敗北、總計林以三比零占優、惠特力圖報服、僅勝一局、惟戰力不衰、極能耐戰、下一局相戰甚烈、林發球先負三記、繼而打成平手、相持不下、高下難分、在五六次平手後、方始判决、林以四比一居勝矣、入後各得一局、成五比二、惠特見勢不佳、力謀反攻、果然老當益壯、迭奏膚功、連創兩局、局數接近、惠特雄雄勃勃、又謀上進、林寳華豈肯放鬆、不數回合、又告終盤、林以六比四勝、</p>
<h3>第三盤　開始之時、雙方無精打彩、惠</h3>
<p>特氣力漸衰、寳華亦未見吃緊、惠特勝第一局後、林忽又施神威、抽球攔網、俱見得心應手之妙瞬息之間、三元連中、惠特不甘示弱、宛如隔夜暴雨之後、重覩天日、不覺精神一振、努力掙扎、施盡平生氣力、奪回一局、無如勢成狂滿、挽回綦難、林一氣呵成、以六二告捷、</p>
<p>六丨三</p>
<p>（二）邱飛海（中）　六丨○　勃龍（英）</p>
<p>六丨一</p>
<p>邱飛海對勃龍之戰、開始略遲、邱爲吾國名將、惟昨因球塲略濕、未見上好表演、然球甚奇巧、或遠或近、或左或右、勃龍年老力衰、加以身體遲笨、難於奔跑赴命、觀者爲之急殺、三盤終了、勃龍已疲憊不堪、氣喘若牛、然成績尙佳、發球及高壓、尙見得手、故能取勝四局、</p>
<h3>第一盤　勃龍開球、先聲奪人、取勝首</h3>
<p>局、後邱連勝三局、勃龍技雖不如、却亦不肯示弱、努力奮鬥、竟能造成各三之和局、殊非易事、邱乃謹愼從事、卒以六比三勝、</p>
<h3>第二盤　邱穩健作戰、殊少虚發、極盡</h3>
<p>刁滑之能事、勃龍招架爲難、遑論進攻、一失再失、邱以六比零全勝長盤、</p>
<h3>第三盤　勃龍已精力衰退、無心戀戰、</h3>
<p>邱一路順風、連下五局、至此勃龍恍如困獸猶鬥、努力掙扎、奪回一局、爭得面子、結果邱以六比一勝、</p>
<h3>今日雙打比賽</h3>
<p>下午四時起林邱出戰</p>
<p>今日爲中英决賽之第二日、僅雙打一組、吾國選手究爲林邱或鄭兆佳江道章出場、尙未决定、英國爲惠特與史篤克、准下午四時開始、英國組實力、亦有可觀、屆時當有良好表演也、</p>

<p>宋述樵辭職</p>
<p>陳希曾仍到局維持</p>
<p>新任滬電報局長宋述樵（二十九）電滬、向交王辭職、略謂、自奉委後、本應遵令前往、惟思滬上中外雜處、情形繁複、際此軍事時期、電信尤關重大、非有長材、難期宏效、職自忖才職兩有未逮、兼以苦病二年、迄今猶未健復、殊難膺此繁劇、用特剖陳下悃、請即准予辭去滬電報局長一職、以讓賢路、</p>
<p>陳希曾自堅决辭去招商局總辦後、昨仍照常至電報局辦公、昨日下午、本報記者曾往訪晤、據陳表示、余對招商局因毫無把握、即籌至數十萬元、亦僅足維持一時、非永久之計、故自始至終即表示不就、至滬電局職務、在未有替人前、當勉爲維持也云云、今宋述樵旣請辭、則陳之蟬聯、自不成問題矣、</p>

<h3>陳希曾准辭　陳希曾自奉命繼任</h3>
<p>招商局總辦後、因對局中事務、殊無把握、故决意不幹、陳氏乃親往首都、向交通部長王伯羣面辭、現聞王部長已經批准、至於陳氏電報局長、大致仍可回任、</p>
<h3>李仲公繼任　招商局總辦一職、</h3>

<h3>金利源案</h3>
<p>高朔法神父今日會見</p>
<p>由法領介紹直接交換意見</p>
<p>新聲社云、金利源碼頭案、因法方公斷員雅米納、以廢約執行公斷人自居、致迄未開始維持原約續租之公斷、前日高朔律師特往訪法總領事甘格林、開誠接洽該案、以甘氏因事未得盡談而散、高律師遂於昨日下午四時、再偕外交部駐滬辦事處副處長劉雲訪、赴法領署、與甘氏會見、協商公斷範圍及定期開始公斷等問題、法領均有切實表示、並商定由甘氏出面、介紹高律師、與三德堂神父、先行直接交換意見、冀圖早日解决、聞高律師准於今日前往三德堂神父面商一</p>

<h3>肺病者須知之七大要點</h3>
<p>日本肺病大醫石神亨博士述</p>
<p>（第一）　凡肺病初起。施以適當之療法。則雖至重之疾。可得治愈。而能永保健康者也。無如自古人多以爲肺病不可治。醫師當就診時。罔不束手咨嗟。而驚爲無救。病者亦因是志頽神喪。而又不甘於待斃。因疑其醫之誤診。不得不乞救於乙醫。乙醫無策。甚而於丙於丁。憧憧往來。無所適從。終托身於醫之不以肺病斷者。療法則疑信參半。藥石則模校兩可。歲月如流。迄無寸效。萬不獲已。乃乞醫於異藥奇方。或針炙咒禱。而病卒不起。嗟何及焉。况乎醫家旣不以肺病告。而病者於預防消毒諸法。絶不措意。其病日劇。其毒亦日播於親戚友朋而未已。洪水之汎濫也。不堤防之。勢必滔滔汨汨。一决千里。誠可浩歎也。然則誤信肺病爲不治。其流弊旣若此。病者當如何及早醫療。而確信爲可治。以全一己之幸福者。全他人乎。</p>
<p>今試就病者之因其狐疑。治之不早。而病適增劇者。約舉二三例如左。</p>
<p>自日本閉關鎖港之禁弛。西洋之文明。日漸輸入。醫學家遂日有進步。獨業於肺病。别無奇效之藥。無論經政府公許之醫。即極表著之名家。亦大率束手而無長策。病者乃不得不就診於舊醫。舊醫以舊法爲主。肺病初發。必禁食一切之滋養物。咯痰消毒諸法。亦等閑視之。不特增人之病。而妨於社會公衆匪淺。能毋寒心耶。漢法之醫書。不論成於何代。無不以肺病爲難治。他不必論。即如癆瘵爲肺病。以瘵稱者。即人亡被祭之義。</p>
<p>（醫說）以此字而冠於病名。漢醫之無以瘉肺病也可知。</p>
<p>又舊醫書有勞蟲之目。（十藥神書）固極妄誕。有識者類鄙之。然國民舊俗向以結核菌爲肺病之蟲。殆視之與癆蟲等。原南陽氏著書（醫事小言）所載癆蟲之說數則。足供一噱。其說之足以惑人聽者。有曰癆蟲生於人之胃中。能漸蝕肋間之肉。蟲性至靈。必竊製牛黄丸以殺之。則蟲不能避。其效如神。設合藥前爲病者所知。則不效云。</p>
<p>又自稱其炙治之法。曰凡四花患門（炙之名稱）合而謂之六花。皆用以炙治癆瘵者。人之脊間。穴凡十六。病發即由此炙之。治癆之奇法。蓋有種種。第均無大騐。四花炙於古今頗稱爲奇效。余雖常用之。然眞癆瘵亦不治。惟氣癖爲效云（氣癖即神經症）又舊醫書中。載肺病之奇效藥頗多。曰天靈蓋。獺肝，蛤蚧，人胆，人油，天石，牛黄等。此無足論。舊醫之淺識者。亦類以是爲稀有之物。要由人心好奇。以少爲貴。故珍之如鳳毛麟角。即得之未必奏效也。日本於今日。其人民之智識未啟。每　諸藥之名。以不得一嘗試爲憾。而適以悮其生命者。不知凡幾。可憫孰甚焉。</p>
<p>（第二）　肺病者。須早受診斷於醫師。如前所述。初發時。即施以適當之方法。病者旣不至呻吟於床第。菌毒亦得隨時殺之。而不任感染。即染矣而傳毒至淺。猶易瘳也。（第三）　肺病確爲傳染病。而痰毒不宜散亂。自病者鮮注意於此。隨地咯痰。不即消毒。因而染及嬌妻弱子。漸則傳播於一家族。而面食以斬。其慘劇類如此。近年患肺病者日増。同胞失仁壽之樂。國家減生産之力。要由病毒之散亂而致。故病者各存慈愛心與公德心。不論家之内外。必愼防之。</p>
<p>（第四）　肺病者之痰。宜咯出而不復下嚥。設誤嚥之。痰毒必傳染於腸。而發爲腸結核。凡小兒及年少者。每不解傳毒之理。且女子當及笄時。往往恥咯痰於他人之前。嚥入之。腸結核由是而發。其肺病雖輕。而下痢與消化不良。俱足衰弱其體。治療之不益困難耶。故年少之父母者。當切戒焉。</p>
<p>（第五）　滋養之食餌不可闕乏。舊醫之診病也。每禁人之内食。一切膳品。貴淡而不貴濃。貴少而不貴多。固守常法。牢不可破。或漫爲炙治。於醫術粗知一二。而妄以自誤者誤人。謂病者於白粥鹽梅而外概忌食之。又紕繆之甚者矣。</p>
<p>（第六）愼飲酒及房事。飲酒過多足以傷生。固盡人而知之。至房事之爲害於肺病。更無待贅言。凡未婚之男女。當延其結婚之期。旣婚者以分居爲宜。</p>
<p>（第七）　塵埃之地。宜避而不居。如劇塲夜市等。爲衆人所羣集。其空氣不潔。不宜入之。散步時則擇市外清曠之區。即偶一人市。亦防之毋懈。</p>
<h3>德國最著名芙列美爾療養院</h3>
<p>（一八五九年德國最初創立之肺療院）</p>
<h3>肺癆病之化學新療法</h3>
<p>蓋肺結核（即肺癆）之原因是結核菌。而此菌一入人體内。則於該處。便成結節。以斷血行之路。又結核菌能分泌一種抗酸性蠟質。包圍其體。以防禦一切外來藥力之侵入。故雖用種種殺菌藥。内服或注射。終不能達其病菌之實體内。歷來醫家所慣用之自然療法，對症療法，理學的療法，血清療法，藥劑療法，及其他一切治療法等。尙未完全成功。而肺病無藥之說。遍滿於一世者。因未知此深奥學理故耳。由此現代結核學者。根據上述之學理。繼續研究。不遺餘力。結果竟成此殺盡肺癆菌之化學聖劑。名曰三那星Ｓanosin此藥係遵肺癆菌發明者德國考克博士與肺癆菌脫蠟術發明家德國栢格爾博士之最新醫理而發明成功者。據現下德國瑞士及其他各國諸肺病療養院之實驗報告。此藥有渗透肺病　之結節及溶解蠟質之作用。兼具有殺菌力。能根治一二三期之肺癆。確有萬試萬靈之特效。在中國。業經國民政府中央衛生試驗所化騐。藥性和平無毒。絶無任何副作用。</p>
<p>茲略舉醫治作用於下</p>
<p>（一）設於試驗管中。實驗「三那星」之藥力作用。則一分鐘後。結核菌皆消失其抗酸性。至三分鐘後。則此肺結核菌。完全殺盡。無一倖免。</p>
<p>（二）依動物試騐。則發見「三那星」能滲入結核病竈内。設檢查其病竈内潜伏之結核菌。則盡失其抗酸性。此足證明其蠟質之完全溶解矣。</p>
<p>（三）如患者内服「三那星」一星期左右。則立見咯痰稀釋。體熱下降等良好狀態。</p>
<p>（四）更繼續内服「三那星」達三十天至六十天以上。則顯見體重增加。食慾激進。一切症狀。逐漸緩和。終達其回天再造之偉功。</p>
<p>奉送三那星實騐報告書及肺病療養指導書函索卽寄</p>

<p>自由談付之一笑  海客　　主人—怎麽樣。你已把我的信面交了王先上没有。　　僕人—没有。因爲他已出去了。寫字間的門也上了鎖。　　主人—我呌你守候他回來的。你自已怎麽趕回來了。　　僕人—我因爲見他門上貼有一張紙條兒。寫著「立刻回來。」所以我立刻回來了。　　　富人—我倘答應了將這筆錢借給你。你甚麽時候纔可以還給我呢。　　窮朋友—我敢以紳士的名譽與人格作擔保。準在三個月後奉還。　　富人—那麽你且把這位紳士請來了再說　　經理—我出了錢僱用你來。是呌你做甚麽的。　　書記—呌我給你辦事。　　經理—是啊。但我並没有呌你瞌睡。　　書記—好在我的瞌睡也包括在辦事日程以内。並不在規定的薪水外要你多出一個錢的。　　旅客—這房間的地位很好開出窗去。風景十分優美。足以引起我甜蜜的回憶。旅店主人—甜蜜的回憶。應有相當的代價、每天的房錢。須增加百分之十。誌廣德匪首三條腿  文俠　　皖省素爲康平之區。皖南尤爲豐樂之土。所謂匪。皖人不過在報上所習見耳。有之。惟在革軍興起軍閥倒台以後。蓋兵散爲匪。軍而一潰。即爲匪製造廠出貨時耳。廣德縣鄰浙東。匪據爲出没之地。已有年矣。自太湖匪猖以後。勢乃益熾。宣廣郎溪各縣。爲之枕席不安。官軍雖迭次馳剿。而此來彼往。殊有疲於奔命之概。首部衛戍司令部派駐皖省之衛戍團。前曾奉令回京。而於廣德則仍留一營以防匪。可見其未可忽視也。匪有首。領名三條腿者。强悍異常。廣德婦孺咸知蓋飛賊之流亞也。一日可盡三四百里之路。因有三條腿之名。畜有黑馬一疋。馳躍如閃電。神駒也。有其人復有其馬。三條腿之名乃益噪。隸其下之親屬匪衆。亦猛勇出衆。剿匪官軍之於三條腿。更爲重視。月前衛戍團第三營營長封靖海君。率部在廣剿匪。匪衆已擊散。偵知三條腿一股潛匿某山内。乃散兵擬圍捕之。佈陣方竣。而三條腿出。兩手各執駁殼槍一。躍登山巓。大聲謂官兵曰。若曹爲捕三條腿而來耶。我即三條腿也。然我非自願作匪者。實政治有以驅我。飢寒有以逼我耳大家弟兄月得幾何。同爲果腹計耳。又何必逼我太甚。然我决不能埀手就逮爲若曹得功賞也。此山洞徑龐雜。非若曹所能知。我今將自某方某洞出。請待之該處可。若被捕獲。亦所願也。詞畢尋徑而没。封營長時正督隊軍中。悉三條腿自命爲綠林豪客。言當不虚。即以手提機槍駁殼槍等。密佈某洞之口。俄而三條腿果率衆出矣。一時官方彈如急雨。直逼洞口注射。乃三條腿竟於其時。雙手開槍。大聲急呼。一躍而逝。僅傷其部下一二人而巳。封營長。一少年英勇之軍官也。士兵亦久經疆塲者。然對三條腿則無可如何。封君回蕪後。與友人談及。對三條腿之身懷絶技。走入歧途。尙深爲惋惜云。奇異之死  璧人　　鄰有張君者。日昨晚飯後。納凉於庭中。偕諸友閒談中有一王姓者。戲謂張曰。汝能盡三瓶汽水乎。張君遽曰能之。於是二人互賭東道。命婢購汽水半打回。以三瓶饋諸友。餘則張君自飲。不一刻而罄。衆皆服其量。王君遂負。　　半句鐘後。張君微覺腹脹且痛。知有異。急服十滴藥水。絲毫無效。痛反加甚。面色灰白。如臨死之人。衆大驚。急召西醫至。已不及救。據西醫云。夏日炎熱。人多飲冰冷物。以求一時之快樂。殊不知即因此戕其一身。而汽水尤甚。蓋汽水入腹。腸即膨脹。過脹則死矣。噫。吾人可不加之意乎。葉園游泳之慘劇  李慶多　　初秋天氣。暑熱未消。一般喜泳者。興猶未减。而園林泉石。游者正多。蓋藉以滌署也。閘北德榮里有何姓者。爲納凉計。乘星期日（二十四日）之暇。邀友聯袂赴江灣葉家花園游覽。一行男女大小共二十餘人。清晨九時即驅車同往。抵園後。各自游覽。或登假山。或坐綠陰。或閒步看花。各樂其樂。更有數人共作竹戰之戲。故結隊同行者。至是乃分道游息。行蹤渙散。　　池中游泳　園中引水成池。環繞四週。淺者一二尺。深者六七尺。頗爲清冽。游客有入池游泳者。管園者亦不禁阻。是日游客殊夥。嬉水者頗不乏人。一行中有陳紹南者。閘北保衛團團員也。深欲學泳。乃於下午三時許。乘其友不覺。暗將友之泳衣穿上。　　慘遭滅頂　獨自馳至園中「石龍」附近之池畔。縱身躍入水中。久不上淨。有游客經其地。睹此頗以爲異。乃奔告其同行者。一時諸人畢集。知其沈溺。急呼人入水救援。迨舁至岸時。已奄奄埀斃。口含污泥。腹中飽水。惟氣尙未絶。　　醫生施救　游客中適有醫師兩人。聞訊趕至。急試施救。欲使吐水復蘇。但已返魂無術。遂棄置道旁。口流白沬。爲狀極慘。同行者睹狀。驚駭欲絶。束手無策。惟有痛惜欷嘘。幼者更口噤色變。初不料遭此凶變也。肇禍後。管園者急以電話報告江灣警察所。邀所長前來察勘。同時遣人奔告閘北川公路德福里八號死者之寓所。着其家屬來園領屍。　　游客扣留　管園者以命案發生。關係重大。未便任游客散去而遺屍園中。致滋重累。乃立將大門鎖閉。不准出園。大好園林。不啻變爲臨時監獄。一時有踰牆逃脫者。狀殊狼狽。餘惟靜坐以待善後。旋警所長蒞園。察看一過。以死者乃自溺。於他人無與。故亦未置何詞。至傍晚六時許。死者家屬趕至。將屍認領。先舁出園外。再移往粤商醫院入殮。　　簽名放歸　屍旣領去。管園者亦不多究。當與警所長商决。命游客一一書下姓名住址。始啓門釋歸。然衆已受驚不淺。死者年僅二十三。已有妻室。今竟因習泳喪其生命。致使靑春少婦。遽失所天。是亦大可哀也。赤痢雜談  馬蔭良　　赤痢之爲疾。每發於夏秋之交。上海年有流行。而今歲則更甚。尤以小兒及老年人患者爲最危險。往往於二三日間。因心臟衰弱。體力不支而死。是不可不注意也。爲述數言。以告大衆。　　（一）飲食　患痢疾者首當忍餓。諺云喫不煞的痢疾。斯言萬萬不可相信。每見初發甚輕。輒因任意進食而加重者。又有病已漸愈。而因飲食不愼。以致復發者。蓋痢疾一病。病在腸中。若再進食物以刺激其腸道。則病必有增無减。其理甚明。故痢疾實有喫得煞之可能。而忍餓則决無危害。惟開水菓子汁米湯等液汁。則餘之不妨。　　（二）止瀉　赤痢初起。不當止瀉。且當與以瀉劑。使之大瀉。每有病者家屬。見病人下痢頻數。裏急後重。形容衰弱。輒以「再瀉得起否」一語相詢。此言粗聽似頗有理。實則不然。蓋病人之所瀉下。爲妨礙身體健康之毒素。世安有藏毒素於體中之理。是故苟病人實不能服瀉藥時。亦當用灌腸法。以使體中污穢排洩體外。如是則腸道清淨。病愈自易。　　（三）治療　赤痢治法。第一清潔腸道。第二殺滅病原微生物。第三制止瀉下。三者均須經醫生詳細診治。處方服藥。或施注射。大約八至十日可愈。惟病之來勢有輕重。人之賦體有强弱。故痊愈時間亦各不相同。是則在乎醫者之用心。而病家亦當絶對的服從其指示也。　　（四）預防　赤痢病原。由於赤痢細菌。或赤痢變形蟲（又稱阿米巴）。二者在病人大便中。用顯微鏡可以檢得。其達於人體之道。均由口入。由胃至腸。乃發生下痢發熱諸症象。故預防方法。可以「注意飲食之清潔」一語了之。倘若家有患痢者。則對於其排洩物更當用臭水消毒。其伺奉者之手指。最易沾染。當常用藥水肥皂洗之。而於將食時尤當特别注意。此外注射預防疫苗。則反應太劇。人多不喜之。選舉前之德國政黨（上）  黎六曾寄於巴黎　　記者於上次通訊中。即已言及德國議會解决之翌日。各政黨已紛紛活動。爲下屆選舉時肉搏之準備。半月來各政黨一面努力謀内部之團結。與固有地位之鞏固。一面則此拉彼引。謀與異黨聯合。於選舉戰中收合作之效。於以後議會形成較大之勢力。縱横變化。令人莫測。其前途尙在混亂中。此時殊難有所論斷。　　囂震柏所領國家黨之殘餘部分。與喜特列之種族派之聯合。尙未成功。最右派之國家社會黨。頗有吸收囂氏餘衆之意。威斯塔公爵與特列威拉努氏之努力。雖使國黨之叛變份子結合一致。但最右派之土地係仍主張自治。此外平民黨領袖斯苛兒次。曾以該黨名義發佈宣言。主張獨立國家派經濟派與民主派等應於選舉時與該黨團結。俾於下屆議會成一基督敎派之組織。與天主敎派旗鼓相對。但至今此提案尙未發生若何效果。綜上一切活動。均予人以紛雜之感。在此正在進行之選舉戰中。其旗幟鮮明。比較使人注意者。乃日昨成立之一新黨。即德意志政府黨是。　　新黨之創立者。多爲民主派中人。現財政總長笛特立（Ｄietrich）氏爲重要份子之一。新黨成立之原因。乃全因環境逼迫。布律寗總理之决意解散議會。一則因不能在議議取得多數以通過政府之財政法案。二則因維持政府之中庸派政黨有滅亡之險。此中庸派政黨在上屆選舉時已大受損失。其内部之敵對爭執等。更促成其勢力之失墜。政府與右派聯合對付社會民主黨之計劃旣不成功。此等中庸派今於左右兩大政黨之間。大有日漸瓦解之勢爲救濟此等政黨計。其法惟一。即此等政黨之澈底改造。抛棄其固有之政策主義以及不合時。而另從可以取得德國民衆信仰之諸條件下結合爲一而復生。心上温馨（二六五）  包天笑　　第十四回　翠竹淚斑伊人腸斷　紅蓮香褪有女魂離　　且說百花底的懺儂。就是從前普慶里的翠筠。此刻重行出山。却覺得比先前老了不少。想到他們那班尝子裏的倌人。往往嫁人復出。當然也有許多不得已的苦衷。可是也有許多妓女。是以嫁人爲一種政策。大概曲院中人。習於奢華。用錢漫無限制。因爲他們覺得金錢來得容易。也就去得容易。所以十個名妓中。可以推測得出至少有九個是負了債的。但是一上了債台。立刻便可以繼長增。高。原來在娼門社會中有一班人專以放債爲生。他們謂之掮洋鈿。利息是按月二分三分。還有許多利益。如拆份頭之類。譬如借了他們一千塊錢的不到一節利錢就是一百多塊了。一年不還。利錢就是三四百塊。他們看你生意很好。就說三小姐。四小姐。洋錢放在你那裏。再妥當也没有了。現在連本帶利是一千四百塊了。你再找上六百塊。凑成兩千塊錢。算也好算一點。凡是名妓。用錢總是媽媽虎虎。只想自己出風頭。不管三七二十一。用了再說。一千變成兩千。旣如此容易。兩千變成二千。以下四千五千。這個債台。一層層的高上去。到了無法解决的時候。就希望來一個瘟生。那個瘟生。便是有錢的大爺們。這時好位名妓。也實逼處此。只好用伊的操縱手段。佈上迷魂之陣。網羅了這個呆蟲。使他擔任了所負的債。暫時把身體歸他。到了相當時期。依然可以遠走高飛。此中人的術語。謂之「淴浴。」把一身的債。洗一個清。然後再出來度那種浪漫享樂生活。甚而至於再欠債。再淴浴的。也是有的。那娼門的債權團。就希望把錢借給那樣的小姐。他們可以絞取重利。到了後來。中國的許多銀行家。也師其法。把錢借給了軍閥。讓他們去爭城奪地。他們從中剝取厚利。那個軍閥的債台一層層的高築起來。到了無可解决的當兒。一齊推在國民身上。國民是個瘟生的集團。而銀行家賺了錢。不過軍閥的淴浴。比了妓女的淴浴。更爲酷烈。妓女還有個温香軟玉的身體來陪伴你。軍閥只有炸彈大砲機關鎗來奉獻了。妓女雖然淴了浴出來。未必有汁麽儲蓄。軍閥却拆了一個大爛屙。自己刮了不少的錢。到外國一榴。面團團做他的富翁去了。却讓那瘟生的國民。擔負這巨大的債去。</p>

<h3>Central Army</h3>
<p>Advancing on Taikang</p>
<p>Feng's Main Force Gathered in the Tongxu-Weishi Area</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Xiao Zhichu telegraphed to Nanjing, stating that his division is advancing north from Chenzhou and has completely driven away the enemy in front. Currently, the 132nd Brigade has occupied Dai Langdian and Macheng in the vicinity of the Wo River, and the 13th Brigade has successively repelled the enemy at Lincai City and Laozhangzhai.

<p>(Nanjing) A telegram from Luohe reports that the Central Army is launching a fierce attack near Taikang. On the 27th, they occupied Qi Lao Jia and Shuanglou, and the enemy collapsed to the northwest, with over a thousand enemy soldiers killed. Efforts are currently being made to force the enemy at An Ziling and Liulinji to surrender quickly, and a portion of the army is advancing on Taikang to intercept the retreat route of Sun Dianying and Ren Yingqi's troops.

Our army is prepared to attack the Feng army's front line. Bian and Zheng can be recovered with little effort. The Feng army is currently transferring its main force and heavy artillery from the Lanfeng area to the Tongxu-Weishi area, making a desperate resistance. However, the morale of the army is war-weary, and there are signs of disobedience. Feng's tactics involve feigning attacks on the front and launching surprise attacks on both flanks, but these have been seen through by the Central Army. Therefore, the Feng army's repeated attacks on our left flank have been repelled. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) He Chengjun telegraphed on the 29th, reporting that Shuanglou and Qi Lao Jia had been captured in succession. The remnants of Zhang Weixi, Ren Yingqi, Sun Dianying, and Sun Changsheng's forces were all defeated. Taikang and Lanfeng are already under siege. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hu Hanmin Discusses</h3>
<p>The Future of Feng's Army</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Hu Hanmin stated that since the recovery of Jinan, Yan has suffered too much damage and is preparing to abandon Pingjin and retreat to Shanxi. The Feng army on the Longhai and Pinghan lines is gradually becoming unsustainable due to the impact of the collapse of Yan's army on the Jinpu Line. The Central Army is now using a portion of its troops to clear out the remaining enemies in the Neihuang-Lanfeng area and is also launching a flanking attack on Kaifeng from Lanfeng and Kaifeng, linking up with the Xuchang troops to encircle Zhengzhou. Based on the current situation, the future of Feng's army will be: (1) Launching a strong southward advance, attempting to occupy Wuhan; (2) Retreating into Tongguan, seeking self-preservation or entering Sichuan; (3) Moving troops to the Pinghan Line, seizing territory in Hebei. However, all three routes are not easy to pass. First, the Central Army holds a significant advantage on the Pinghan side. Currently, in addition to besieging Xuchang with a portion of its troops, it is also linking up with other units to attack Zhengzhou. The southward advance to Wuhan is no longer possible as it was during Zhang Fakui's attack on Changsha, and now there is even less hope. Second, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces have suffered from natural disasters and human calamities for many years. If Feng's army retreats to Tongguan, the supply of a large number of troops will be a major problem. If they enter Sichuan, the Sichuan army will solidify its defenses. Feng Yuxiang, who has learned from past lessons, will now find it even more difficult to achieve his wish. Third, the Feng army's move to Pingjin may be supported by Wang and others, but Yan's slow refusal is also within expectations. If Feng's army really arrives in Pingjin, the front line may be shortened, and there will be a greater certainty of annihilating them in one fell swoop. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Russian Shares of the China Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Secretly Sold to the United States</p>
<p>Japan Pays Close Attention</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet government has decided to transfer the shares of the China Eastern Railway, which is in dispute with China, to an American capital group. Soviet representatives and American representatives are secretly negotiating in Hamburg, and the negotiations are expected to be completed soon. Although the Soviet side absolutely denies this, the content is to buy back the shares of the Franco-Russian Asian Bank at 67% of their face value and transfer them to the United States. The United States will pay 72% first, and the remaining 25% will be paid in 1933 after the railway is transferred to American management. According to the above news, after 1933, the China Eastern Railway will become a Sino-American joint venture, which has a significant relationship with Japan and is being closely watched.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Revolution Brewing in Argentina</h3>
<p>World powers invariably worry about the growing influence of their colonial autonomous regions and semi-independent countries (those that are nominally independent but in reality still tethered), while rejoicing at the domestic troubles of those countries. They seize upon internal upheavals and political tides to take advantage of the situation and reap profits. This is the most effective means of aggression. The United States, of course, is no exception in its dealings with the small countries of Central and South America. The recent revolution in Peru was greeted by the Peruvian National Party as a welcome step toward breaking free from American influence. However, I immediately dismissed their exuberance, precisely because such internal turmoil and revolutions, if not genuinely driven by patriotism, actually create opportunities for aggression by major powers rather than fostering independence for the affected country. Now, while the revolution in Peru is still ongoing, Argentina has suddenly erupted in domestic strife, prompting widespread concern that it will be the next revolution. Argentina is the largest agricultural country in the Americas, and its industry is also gradually developing. Since its alliance with Brazil and Chile, its politics have also become increasingly progressive. It can be described as one of the most stable and progressive countries in the Americas. However, in the tide of national movements following the European war, Argentina has quietly become a leader of the anti-American faction in Central and South America, which is something the United States dislikes. Any move it makes is bound to attract close scrutiny from the United States. Now, its internal strife is said to be due to labor unrest, while others say it is due to guarding against military interference in politics. The full details are not yet known. While Argentina may be considered relatively well-off in Central and South America, its economy is not very robust due to its military expansion. If its so-called revolution is merely a competition between military figures and political factions, like in Peru, then what good will it do for the Argentine people? I will wait and see.</p>

Although Wang Jingwei is keen to resolve the government issue, Yan Xishan has recently taken a passive attitude towards the issue. The reason for this is that the damage suffered by the Jin army on the Jinpu Line was unexpectedly great, and this has only gradually become clear. With the loss of this strength, Yan is hesitant about the government issue. (29th Dispatch from the Datong News Agency)</p>

British Ambassador Lampson is scheduled to arrive in Nanjing on the 8th of next month to continue discussions on British-Chinese extraterritoriality and other issues.

(3) The issue of the southward relocation of embassies. The American ambassador, Johnson, has formally submitted a request to the government to prepare for the move. The Japanese minister is often in the South for official business. Although his embassy is nominally in Beiping, it is actually in the capital. The embassies of other countries, such as Norway, Cuba, Finland, and newly contracted countries such as Poland, Turkey, and Czechoslovakia, are all located in the capital. However, countries such as Britain, Germany, and France have not expressed a clear position on the embassy issue. (4) Punishing the Simpson incident.

<h3>The Eleventh</h3>
<p>League of Nations Assembly</p>
<p>Opens on September 11th</p>
<p>Two Major Proposals</p>
<p>Decentralization and Disarmament</p>
<p>Geneva News: The League of Nations Assembly is scheduled to hold its eleventh annual meeting on September 11th. The position of chairman will be held by Mr. Zometo, the representative of Venezuela and acting chairman of the Executive Council. The issue of so-called decentralization in the League of Nations organization will be submitted for discussion at this session of the General Assembly. For many years, many League of Nations theorists have believed that the ultimate ideal organization of the League of Nations is to set up a branch of the League of Nations on each continent, and to have the League of Nations general organs in Geneva hold the affairs of each branch of the League of Nations. However, another group of theorists holds the opposite view. The General Assembly will study two plans on decentralization. One is the European Economic Alliance plan advocated by French Foreign Minister Briand for one year under the auspices of the League of Nations, and the other is the South American Alliance plan proposed by Mr. Gureiro, the representative of the Republic of Saldao in South America. The purpose is that South American countries must act in unison on all League of Nations issues related to South America. Regarding the latter case, there are two definite precedents in South America, one is "Britain and its dependencies." When it comes to issues related to them, the United Kingdom and its dependencies always take consistent action through consultation. The second is the "Little Entente." The Little Entente countries also consult with each other on all issues involving their ultimate goals to seek countermeasures. However, there is a very important fundamental difference between the plans of Mr. Briand and the South American countries, that is, according to Mr. Bai's plan, a European combination must be created as a part of the League of Nations, so that the League of Nations has a control power over it. According to the plan of the South American countries, there is no need to create such a combination, and the South American countries will make their own decisions, which has nothing to do with the League of Nations. This is the policy that the United Kingdom and its dependencies and the Little Entente have adopted so far. Moreover, the League of Nations Council has the full possibility of rejecting Briand's plan, while the League of Nations Council cannot interfere with the activities of the South American plan, which is only an informal decentralization. In short, since these two cases have been put forward, and the decentralization of the United Kingdom and the Little Entente already exists, it can be known that the ideal of decentralization has gradually infected the League of Nations. It is expected that this General Assembly will first make a statement on the Briand case, and the result may cause the Council to be divided in practice into five or six independent groups. As for the agenda of this General Assembly, on the whole, it is very important. Among them, the disarmament issue will occupy a major position. It is heard that the British side will vigorously advocate the disarmament issue has been fully agreed at the London Sea Congress, so the League of Nations Preparatory Disarmament Committee in November this year can complete the proposal for a general world disarmament draft on land, sea and air. It is expected that the General Assembly will, based on the British proposal, ask the Executive Council to convene the First World Disarmament Conference in the autumn and winter of 1931. The General Assembly will also elect all the new judges of the Permanent International Court of Justice in The Hague, because the nine-year term of the former judges has expired. In addition, there are three important cases: (1) the case of reconciling the League of Nations Convention with the Kellogg-Briand Pact, (2) the case of providing economic assistance to the invaded country, (3) the case of strengthening the method of preventing war, and the election of three non-permanent members of the Executive Council will also be held at this General Assembly. The countries that have already served their terms are Cuba, Canada and Finland. It is expected that Finland will be succeeded by Norway, and China, Ireland, Australia and South Africa are competing for Canada. The successor to Cuba will not be any of the South American countries. (World)</p>
<h3>German Woman's Suicide in the Sky</h3>
<p>Sacrificing Herself for the Death of Her Husband</p>
<p>Germany Illegally Organizes an Air Force in Russia</p>
<p>Fear of Causing Interference from the French Government</p>
<p>Reuters, 29th, London: German woman Aemlinjer, yesterday bought a flight ticket from Elverfeld to Frankfurt, but suddenly jumped out of the window of the lavatory on the way and fell to her death. This matter seems likely to cause a scandalous case in German politics and cause repercussions in France. The woman left a letter in her handbag, saying that her suicide was in grief for the tragic death of her husband. According to her husband, he fell from a horse and died during a horse race, but in fact, he fell to his death while testing a plane in Russia, because he was hired by the Soviet Russian government as an aviation instructor. The relationship between the leaders of the German and Russian armies is now causing turmoil in German political circles. According to a Reuters reporter in Paris, the French newspapers all said that Captain Aemlinjer's service in Russia was not only sponsored by the German authorities, but he was also a member of the German Air Force compiled in Russia, because the Treaty of Versailles prohibits Germany from organizing an air force, so Germany did this in Russia to avoid attracting attention. Another newspaper said that the captain died while testing a new type of single-wing pursuit plane, which, when chased, could unload the large fuel tank in the air and fly into the clouds at a very high speed with the small fuel tank that had been stored.</p>
<h3>British Labor Government</h3>
<p>Denies Joining Forces with the Liberal Party</p>
<p>Reuters, 29th, London: The rumour that the Labor Party and the Liberal Party have reached an agreement is spreading again, and it is said that the result of the new combination is likely to be the resignation of Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden, so securities have risen in price. The source of this rumour is that Prime Minister MacDonald, Liberal Party leader George, and several Labor Party cabinet members such as Snowden met on Wednesday to discuss the issue of unemployment. Today, the authorities have firmly denied that the two parties have discussed the issue of formal combination, but admit that the two parties are now trying to cooperate to facilitate dealing with the unemployment problem in the autumn, and to consolidate the government's position when the Imperial Conference and the Indian Round Table Conference are in progress.</p>
<h3>Japanese Labor Disputes Increase Sharply</h3>
<p>Nichi-Ren, 29th, Tokyo: As Japan's recession deepens, labor disputes increase. The number of disputes in January this year was 101, which increased to 152 in June, and after entering July, it suddenly increased sharply, exceeding 300. The number of participants is relatively small, because most of the disputes are initiated by those who have been laid off, and those who are employed are afraid of losing their jobs and dare not participate, so the nature of the disputes has a tendency to deteriorate greatly.</p>
<h3>English Channel Swimming</h3>

<p>Associated Press, 27th, Dorang: The championship in the fifteen-mile swimming competition held here was won by Mr. Nelson, who arrived at his destination at 6:43 PM, taking a total of seven hours and forty-four minutes. Mr. Nelson won the first prize of US$10,000.</p>

<h3>Yangzhou Telegram, for the Shanghai News, Recently, according to</h3>
<p>a telegram from the commander of the 265th Regiment of our brigade, Li Jilan, after Ma Yuiren was defeated in the battle of Chenjiayang in Haihe Town, he fled west to the lakes and swamps and reassembled his remnants and bandits from Sihan, totaling about 2,000 people. On the 20th, they occupied Chenjiaqiao Mantan, Lingguan Temple, Dong Zhengzhuang and other places, looting in all directions, hindering the autumn harvest, causing panic in the local area, and the people were unable to live. In respectful observance of this day, I led all the battalions of my troops and one squadron each of the Fu Salt County police to suppress them separately. After a day and night of fierce fighting, more than 200 bandits were killed. More than 20 male and female hostages and more than 100 bandit boats were intercepted in Gaoguo. The remnant bandits fled into the swamp led by Ma and his false division commanders Liu Hanming, Zhou Xiangting, and Ji Longzhang. However, when our Third Battalion attacked Dong Zhengzhuang, the bandits resisted with fortifications and strongholds. Our officers and soldiers were exceptionally brave, fighting with guns and artillery. The bandits only retreated at night after fighting until 9:00 PM. Battalion Commander Zhenzhong was hit by a bullet. He died of his injuries at the Yancheng Hospital at 2:00 PM this afternoon. Meng Xiang, the acting platoon leader of the mortar company, was killed in battle. A total of more than 30 soldiers were killed and wounded. The Second Battalion is now stationed in Shanggang and the First Battalion of the 26th Regiment is stationed in Funing. Although the remnants of Ma's troops have not been completely annihilated after this severe blow, they are no longer capable of rioting. However, the salt and Fu people's militia are scattered, and their guns have been confiscated. They still do not know how to strive for unity and fundamentally eliminate the bandits, which is not a short-term matter, and is a great sigh. In addition to thoroughly investigating the consumption, casualties, and spoils, and submitting another document to request separate condolence payments, I hereby report to you first. Accordingly, please publish it in your newspaper so that the public can know. Respectfully, the Staff Office of the 133rd Brigade Headquarters.</p>

The attendees were He Yingqin, Director of the Provisional Headquarters; Zeng Kuangqing, representative of the Central Government; Xie Liangzi, representative of the Hunan Provincial Government; Tan Changkai, representative of the Provincial Party Headquarters; Yu Xiangsan, representative of the Fourth Route Army; Wang Yinxi, representative of the Jiangxi Provincial Government; Yin Jingrang, representative of the Provincial Party Headquarters; Lu Xiaochen, representative of the Ninth Route Army; Wu Xingya, representative of the Hubei Provincial Government; Zuo Duo, representative of the Provincial Party Headquarters; Liu Wendao, representative of the Hankou Municipal Government; Xiao Ruoxu, representative of the Hankou Municipal Party Headquarters; Ye Peng, representative of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters; Ouyang Xin, representative of the New 22nd Division; Peng Qibiao, representative of the Independent 14th Brigade; Wang Lun, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Provisional Headquarters; Zhou Weigang, Director of the General Staff Office; Zhou Shaojin, Deputy Director; Yuan Zhuqiao, Director of the Military Law Department; and 19 others. Tu Shangyi, Chief of Staff of the Independent 2nd Brigade Han Jie, was temporarily added, totaling 20 people. Chaired by He Yingqin, the meeting discussed the General Outline and Regulations for the Implementation of Bandit Suppression in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, as well as proposals from various representatives, according to the agenda. After a lengthy discussion, the General Outline for the Implementation of Bandit Suppression and three proposals from the chairman were passed. Subsequently, eight proposals from the Jiangxi Provincial Party Headquarters were discussed and resolved, with three reserved for reference and five to be discussed together. After separate revisions and approvals, the details were not available due to the military secrecy of the proposals. The other cases were also decided to be classified and organized according to the nature of the party, government, and military affairs, and were left for continued discussion on the 29th. However, due to the large number of proposals, it is feared that they cannot be completely discussed in one day, and the meeting may be postponed. However, all attendees cannot delay due to official duties and urgently need to return to their provinces to prepare for implementation. According to an official of the Provisional Headquarters, no matter what, the discussion can be completed on the third day. It is heard that Director He intends to host a banquet for the representatives of the three provinces and those present after the closing ceremony of the conference on the 29th. The Jiangxi representatives Lu Xiaochen and Wang Yinxi will also host a banquet for the press on the same day to report on the bandit situation in Jiangxi, and the entire group will return to their provinces on the 30th.

<h3>Yang Shuzhuang Concurrently Serves as Director of the Department of Civil Affairs of Fujian</h3>
<p>Fuzhou correspondence: The three directors of finance, construction, and education of Fujian Province have been formally appointed by the National Government, with He Gonggan, Jiang Pingfan, and Lin Jinan acting as agents, and have all taken office. However, for the position of Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, the National Government originally ordered Chen Peiyin, member of the Provincial Government, to act as agent, but Chen firmly refused. After Yang Shuzhuang returned to Fujian, although he persuaded him many times, Chen still had no intention of accepting. Yang first planned to guarantee Chen Zuwang, Secretary of the Naval Department who followed him back to Fujian, to act as agent, but it did not work out due to an incident. Later, Yang and Liu Heding jointly telegraphed Shanghai to invite Zheng Xiaoyu (Zheng Xiaoxu's younger brother), the former Director of the Anhui Department of Political Affairs, back to Fujian to ask him to act as agent of the Department of Civil Affairs. Zheng originally agreed, but after returning to Fujian and observing the political situation, he was reluctant to take sole charge in his declining years (Zheng is now 68 years old) and strongly declined. Yang Shuzhuang hired him as a military advisor to the Provincial Government, and Liu Heding hired him as a councilor of the 56th Division. However, Yang considered the Department of Civil Affairs to be the political hub of the province, and the position of director was of great importance and should not be left vacant for a long time. He then discussed with Zheng to change the approach. Yang himself would concurrently serve as the director of the Department, and Zheng would be appointed as the chief secretary to handle matters on his behalf. Zheng finally agreed. Yang then telegraphed the National Government to request to concurrently serve as the director of the Department of Civil Affairs. An approval reply was received on the 23rd, and Yang went to the Department of Civil Affairs at 11:00 a.m. on the 25th to take over the seal and assume his duties. He immediately issued an order to appoint Zheng Xiaoyu as the chief secretary and encouraged the staff to continue to serve as usual. Zheng has now scheduled to take over on the 27th. Generally, ordinary official documents will be handled by Zheng himself, and important ones will be referred to Yang (because the Provincial Government and the Department of Civil Affairs are in the same place, so the round trip is still convenient). The long-pending issue of the director of the Department of Civil Affairs has finally come to an end. (26th)</p>
<h3>Mutiny Incident of the Garrison in Yuguan</h3>
<p>Shenyang correspondence: Zhang Xueliang has already revealed the incident of the Northeast Garrison in Yuguan in a telegraph. As for the reason for the discovery, according to a certain important person, Tao Dunli, who incited the troops, is a native of Hubei and was originally the chief of staff of Kou Yingjie. He previously served as a consultant for the 34th Army Corps. He is currently in the Northeast without any position. Therefore, Tao seems to have contacts with all parties. However, his integrity is not good, and he has no fixed purpose, so he has been reduced to a third or fourth-rate character. The authorities do not pay much attention to his whereabouts. It is unexpected that his conspiracy was unruly, and he even had the behavior of inciting the troops in Yuguan, which was beyond the expectations of the authorities. As for Ma Tingfu, commander of the 23rd Brigade, was the old subordinate of Yu Xuezhong, commander of the Yuguan garrison. Commander Yu was completely unaware of this beforehand. However, the middle and lower-ranking officers of the units under Ma's brigade were all graduates of the Northeast Military Academy and were unwilling to agree, so they directly reported to Commander Yu. According to the report, Yu immediately reported to Commander Zhang, who was in Beidaihe, and ordered Ma and others to be arrested and detained together. Rong Zhen, Director of the Military Department of the Northeast Border Defense Commander's Office, recently received a letter from Yang Zhengzhi, Director of the Adjutant's Office, from Beidaihe, describing the situation at the time of the Yuguan incident, roughly saying that Ma (Tingfu) Meng (Baifu)'s matter was reported by Commander Yu. On the 14th, the Commander-in-chief summoned the regimental commanders of the nearby garrison (56 brigades all arrived) on the pretext of giving a speech, and immediately arrested Ma, Meng, and An Fukui. Tao and others were also arrested at the Tongfu Hotel (in Beidaihe). At that time, the market did not show any panic. However, after Commander Yu returned to Yuguan, because martial law was implemented, the train was delayed. In addition, the passengers in the Tongfu Hotel were suspicious of the situation at the time and could not help but panic. Many people went to Tianjin that night, which caused rumors to spread in Pingjin first, but Dagongbao corrected it on the 17th. Unexpectedly, Shenyuan is still in rumors. Xu Zaipu (Shiying, that is, the Deputy Commander of Aviation) came and met with the Commander-in-chief and talked about this matter, and they all laughed it off. Yesterday, when Xu was about to leave, the Commander-in-chief ordered him to tell the Director to supervise the committee members to quickly repair the long-distance telephone and railway, so as to avoid rumors. It is not yet known when the Commander-in-chief will be able to return to Shenyang. It is said that he will be able to leave here at the end of this month. It is heard that Zhang Xueliang believes that Tao Dunli, Ma Tingfu, Meng Baifu, An Fukui, and others who were arrested are hateful for inciting them from the middle and for acting rashly. They must be strictly interrogated. Once traffic is restored, they will be sent to Shenyang under escort by cadres and handed over to the Military Law Department for trial. (24th)</p>
<h3>There is Still No Prospect for the Sino-Russian Conference to Open</h3>
<p>Harbin correspondence: Tanaka, the Japanese Ambassador to Russia, departed from Moscow on the 15th of this month and returned to his country. When he passed through Harbin, Modehui sent a telegram from the Russian capital a few days earlier, instructing Jin Ronggui, the consultant of the Directorate of the Chinese Eastern Railway, to properly entertain the ambassador when he passed through the border. On the morning of the 22nd, Tanaka arrived in Harbin and transferred to a train south at 9:00 a.m. that day. According to him, when I left Moscow, the representatives of China and Russia were still working hard to hold the conference. However, I have not heard when the formal negotiations will begin. The residence and office of the Chinese representative Modehui and his party have recently moved from the hotel to a private residence, which seems to be a long-term residence. The outcome of the Sino-Russian conference may be a compromise, but it must go through a long period of negotiations and cannot be resolved in the near future." Also, yesterday, the relevant parties here received a telegram from Moscow (23rd), stating that the Central Government has ordered that the scope of the Sino-Russian conference can be appropriately expanded. Informal meetings are still in progress. Mo Quanwei (19th) met with Karakhan again and stated the Central Government's intention to expand the scope of the conference, indicating that the two items of navigation rights and commercial treaty can still be proposed for discussion. Karakhan was deeply dissatisfied that our Central Government had not issued a declaration recognizing the validity of the Boli Record, and pointed out that China had no sincerity in holding the conference and insisted that the Chinese government must issue a declaration recognizing the validity of the Boli Agreement before the conference can be held, so the negotiations were fruitless. A certain commissioner following Modehui telegraphed a certain important person here the other day about the Sino-Russian conference, saying, "Informal meetings are still in progress. The current point of contention between the two sides is the declaration of the last-signed Boli Record. The Russian side is firmly unwilling to give in, and the future is still difficult to be optimistic. This negotiation is greatly affected by the domestic political situation. The result depends entirely on whether the domestic political situation can be stabilized as soon as possible. Judging from the current situation, the date of the opening of the formal meeting is still difficult to predict. Even if everything goes smoothly, it will have to open in winter. The Soviet Union seems to be still watching our domestic political situation." According to this news, I am afraid that the Central Government will not issue a declaration to reverse the March 18 declaration to Russia, and the Sino-Russian conference will be difficult to open.

<h3>Northeast Strictly Prohibits the Export of Raw Gold</h3>
<p>Harbin correspondence: The Northeast Political Affairs Committee has recently learned that foreigners are secretly buying raw gold in the Northeast and transporting it out of the country, hoping to profit from it. Yesterday, it specifically ordered the governments of the three provinces to strictly prohibit it. The order is as follows: "Since several months ago, the wave of gold being expensive and silver being cheap has shocked the whole country, and merchants and people are panicked and cannot live in peace. The fundamental solution must be to return to the gold standard system. The superficial solution is to restrict the import and export of gold and silver. Moreover, the local conditions are different, and the method of restriction should not be the same. The Northeast is close to strong neighbors, and the policy of economic aggression has long been obvious to all. Recently, the rise in gold notes has affected our merchants to the point of great pain. Moreover, it does not stop there. Since the implementation of the gold ban, they have been preparing for cash transactions. When gold prices rose sharply, they even bought raw gold. It is heard that they have sent many people to secretly buy from gold shops and small silver shops in the three provinces at high prices. Their intention seems to be to seek their own sufficient preparation on the surface, but in fact, it will inevitably promote the disturbance of our country's finance. Although there are the same actions in other provinces and treaty ports, either exports have been prohibited, or because there are not many sellers and it is not easy to collect during the gold-expensive era, the three provinces have become their only buying market. In addition, our merchants are eager for short-term profits and act as accomplices, which is unavoidable, which leads to an increase in gold prices in the eastern provinces. If strict bans are not implemented, it will not be enough to prevent the outflow of raw gold and make up for the hidden dangers of finance. In addition to acting separately, we must urgently order you to strictly prohibit the people from selling raw gold to foreigners and transporting it out of the country for profit. Those who are caught will have half of their gold confiscated and half used as a reward to show warning and prevent private sales. In addition, the handling situation will be reported." In addition, the Northeast Chamber of Commerce also sent a circular to chambers of commerce everywhere, requiring that all trade with Japanese merchants be based on silver dollars. When it is absolutely necessary, other currencies must be used instead to avoid direct transactions of gold notes, so as to avoid being affected by the gold tide. (2</p>

<h3>Anhui and Zhejiang Provinces Have Another Boundary Dispute</h3>
<p>Anhui People Oppose the Re-surveying of the Boundary Between Jixi and Changhua</p>
<p>Wuhu correspondence: Danyang Lake, which belongs to Dangtu County, Anhui Province, borders Gaochun County, Jiangsu Province, causing a boundary dispute that has lasted for decades and cannot be resolved. A few months ago, the Ministry of Interior and the governments of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces each sent representatives to conduct an on-site survey for administrative system statistics and to avoid disputes among the people of the two provinces. After the survey, an arbitration meeting was held in Beijing. Jiang Zhongya, the magistrate of Dangtu County, also went to Beijing. However, as a result of the meeting, Jiangsu and Anhui held their own opinions and could not be decided. Now the Anhui Provincial Committee and Magistrate Jiang have returned to Anhui, and the case has been shelved again. Unexpectedly, recently, Jingzhou, Jixi County, which belongs to the Huizhou region of Anhui Province, has had a boundary dispute with Changhua County, Zhejiang Province. It has been found that the boundary problem between Jixi and Changhua has been surveyed by committees sent by the Ministry and the provinces. According to the natural terrain, maps, and documents, the dividing line between the two counties should be at the dividing ridge Shimen Pool Limestone Ridge, and it has also been presented to the case. However, recently, the Ministry of Interior suddenly issued a ministry order to cancel the previous case of the ministry and province joint survey and advocated reconsideration. As a result, the people of Jingzhou protested. The previous request for a survey to delineate the boundary was based on natural terrain, traffic conditions, industrial and commercial conditions, construction plans, land tax system, and the special conditions of population, customs, habits, living languages, etc. Now, it is proposed to erase everything, causing the Changhua authorities to arbitrarily arrest village chiefs before the provincial border is determined, and send armed police and police to coerce border residents to report land, and divide and number all areas under the jurisdiction of Jixi. The Anhui people believe that such a method not only violates the spirit of the times, but also incites tribal disputes. In addition to unanimously opposing the reconsideration claim, they also sent a telegram to the Anhui Provincial Government, requesting it to transfer it to the Ministry of Interior as soon as possible, cancel the reconsideration order, respect the previous case of the Ministry and the province's joint survey, carefully review the various maps and documents submitted by the commissioners of Anhui and Zhejiang provinces, and solve the long-standing boundary dispute between Jixi and Changhua counties as soon as possible in accordance with the regulations of the provincial and municipal county boundary survey regulations, in order to eliminate the people's suffering. They also sent a telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, ordering the Changhua County Government to immediately stop all forced land reporting matters in Jingzhou before the provincial border is determined, so as to avoid incidents. All circles in Jingzhou also issued a telegram, requesting the people of Anhui and all circles in the country to provide unanimous support, so that the feudal miscellaneous jurisdiction rights that undermine administrative unity can be completely abolished.

<h3>The Wuhu Municipal Administration Office Decided to Abolish</h3>
<p>Wuhu correspondence: Wuhu is the first town in Anhui Province and one of the treaty ports along the Yangtze River. The Anhui authorities are quite determined to work hard on construction so that it can become a model area in Anhui Province, and plan to move the Anhui Provincial Government and various departments to Wuhu at an appropriate time. Therefore, the Wuhu Municipal Administration Preparatory Office was established in the autumn of the 17th year. The population of Wuhu is only about 150,000 to 160,000. If a formal municipal government is established, the citizens must have 200,000 people to qualify. At the beginning of the establishment of the Municipal Administration Preparatory Office, Shao Yizhou was appointed as the director, and the funds were temporarily subsidized by the provincial government. The organization of the municipal government includes the public security, social education, and other bureaus. However, it has not been implemented during the preparation period. Only the business shop donations and slaughtering tooth stickers collected by the Public Security Bureau have been taken over. Later, a municipal donation was created, totaling no less than 20,000 yuan. In view of this, the provincial government stopped allocating the temporary subsidy funds, and the office had to transfer the municipal donation used for construction to regular expenses, which required more than 8,000 yuan per month. In addition to the police salaries of the Public Security Bureau, the so-called construction special funds have disappeared. The citizens and merchants have only increased their burden. The office has also successively created rapeseed donations, banquet donations, and passenger donations. The people of Wuhu could not bear the exploitation and repeatedly appealed to the province to stop collecting the donations and abolish the Municipal Administration Preparatory Office. Recently, the Anhui Provincial Government also deeply believes that the Wuhu Municipal Administration Preparatory Office has no benefit to the municipal administration and only adds a redundant agency. Therefore, at the provincial government meeting on the 26th, it was decided to abolish the Wuhu Municipal Administration Preparatory Office. The affairs of each department of the office that belong to the city will be handed over to the Public Security Bureau, and those that belong to the county area will be handed over to the Wuhu County Government. Only a part of the Engineering Bureau will be retained. The bureau will be directly under the Provincial Construction Department in the future. Li Fanyi, Director of the Construction Department, telegraphed Wuhu last night to inform Shao Yizhou, Director of the Municipal Administration Preparatory Office. Shao has gone to the province today to present everything in person. The office is rushing to complete the conclusion and will implement the abolition at the end of this month. (27th)</p>
<h3>The Jiangsu Provincial Magistrate Examination Has Ended</h3>
<p>Certificates Have Been Issued to the 19 Who Passed</p>
<p>Nineteen people of the second and third classes who passed the Jiangsu Provincial Magistrate Examination went to the Provincial Government at 2:00 p.m. on the 28th to receive their certificates. They first reported to the Chengqi Office, and then Meng Liu of the General Affairs Bureau led them into the general conference room and sat on both sides of the long table. The chief examiner, Ye Chucang, came out from the inside, and they bowed to each other. Ye took the chair and gave a brief speech, saying that he was very pleased to meet you today, because the times are difficult and there is no extravagance. There will be many opportunities to meet you in the future, and we will talk in detail. However, today my position is still as one of the examiners. You have obtained diplomas today, which can be regarded as the end of the mission of the examiners. The Examination Committee will report the passing situation of you to the Examination Yuan in a few days. After the Examination Yuan sends the documents, you will be assigned to Jiangsu Province for employment. After this, I will use the qualifications of a member of Jiangsu Province to talk with you as colleagues. Then, the certificates were issued one by one, and each person accepted and retreated.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Kidnapped Individuals from Desheng Port Escorted Back to Songjiang　Xu Wenjie, his son Xu Heguan, and his nephew Wu Huanzhang, all of Desheng Port, were kidnapped by bandits on the 25th. The next day, the bandit boat docked at Gaochang Temple, Hanjiang Port. Xu seized the opportunity when the bandits were snoring loudly, disembarked, escaped, and reported to the Public Security Bureau. The Bureau dispatched detectives and police to the boat, capturing the kidnappers Lu Shengkuo, the bandit’s wife Lu Wangshi, and Gao Changli, a total of three individuals. They were brought back to the Bureau for interrogation and then sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation. Xu reported the incident to Songjiang from Gaochang Temple.

They were brought back today (29th) at 5:00 PM and are temporarily detained at the County Government, awaiting transfer to the County Court for trial.</p>
<p>Joint Suppression by Land and Water Military Police Proves Victorious　Lake bandit Tai Bao A Shu led a gang to harass various towns in Jin County and the Zhejiang Province border, seizing weapons and kidnapping people, behaving rampantly. Yesterday, the Chief of the 4th Anti-Smuggling Brigade and the Water Public Security Team, District Chief Ze Kuan, and Captain Fan Guozhong, along with Xu Pucheng from the 2nd District of Zhejiang Province (aboard the "Zhi Guo" warship), and Xie, the Company Commander of the 5th Division of the Army, and Yi, the Anti-Bandit Commander from Hangzhou, Zhejiang Army, jointly suppressed the bandits. They pursued them from Langxiawei to the Gaoxu area, engaging in a five-hour battle. As a result, over ten bandits were captured, and over ten were killed. Sixteen bandit boats were seized.

They are now planning further joint suppression to completely eradicate the bandits.　　The County Government Plans to Raise Treasury Bonds　The County Government previously received an order from the Provincial Office to raise treasury bonds within a limited time. Today, they convened a meeting of various organizations, who all agreed that it was difficult to raise funds during the current lean season. Therefore, it was decided to add two yuan of grain tribute to this year's business tax, to be collected by the township police. The grain depots should collect and remit as much as possible. Once the fundraising target is achieved, the borrowed tribute will be returned.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>

<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Breakthrough in the Huoyi Kou Murder Case　An unidentified male corpse was discovered in the Huoyi Kou area of the Fifth District of Wuyi County. District Chief Huang Gongwang reported the incident to the County Court, which dispatched personnel to conduct an examination. It was determined that the victim had been fatally struck with an iron or wooden object. Chief Prosecutor Yang deemed the case a homicide and ordered Judicial Police Chief Liu Shiqin to investigate. It was discovered that the murderers were Han Renchang, Liu Rongshou, and Liu Shixing. The deceased was a thief who, along with two accomplices, went to Han Renchang's house to steal. Han was awakened, and with the help of others, captured the thief and beat him severely. Liu Shixing struck the thief on the head with a carrying pole, causing a skull fracture that resulted in death. Police Chief Liu went to arrest the suspects, but village chief Wang Binglin repeatedly offered bribes of twenty-five yuan on behalf of Liu and others. Police Chief Liu reported this to the Prosecutor, who then ordered the Fifth Public Security Sub-Bureau to arrest Wang Binglin, Han Renchang, and Liu Rongshou and bring them to the court. The murderer Liu Shixing escaped. On the 28th, the Prosecutor held a court hearing, and the testimonies of the individuals were generally consistent with Police Chief Liu's report. The Prosecutor then ordered each individual to be released on bail pending further proceedings.</p>
<p>County Court Requests Appropriation of the Old Prefecture Office　The Wuyi County Court stated that its current premises were insufficient for its needs, and that the detention center and prison workshop were also unsuitable. It was determined that the old Changzhou Prefecture Office could be appropriated for their use. A request was submitted to the High Court, which forwarded it to the Provincial Government for approval. The Provincial Government, at its 326th meeting, decided to instruct the Department of Civil Affairs to investigate and respond. The President of the County Court and the Chief Prosecutor again sent a letter to County Chief Wu yesterday, requesting assistance in appropriating the premises. However, the old Prefecture Office currently houses the County Middle School, so this issue will not be easily resolved without proper consultation and planning.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Resolution of the Xicheng Road Vehicle License Fee Issue　Since the southern section of the Xicheng Road opened to traffic on the 20th of this month, various vehicles have been using it. However, due to the loose mud on the road, the Xicheng public long-distance buses have shortened their routes due to the danger of travel. The Construction Bureau has now determined the license fees for various vehicles and submitted them to the County Government Meeting, which has already been decided. The monthly license fee for commercial rickshaws is 70 cents in silver, for private rickshaws it is one yuan per three months, and for private commercial bicycles it is one yuan per three months.</p>
<p>Issue of Collecting Autumn Cocoon Tax　The issue of collecting a small autumn cocoon tax has been approved by the National Government's Ministry of Finance, with half the tax being collected and half being exempted. The Ministry ordered the financial departments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and special commissioners to follow this order. Recently, the autumn silkworms in the four townships of this county have already undergone their second sleep for the early batches, while the late batches are still hatching. The autumn cocoon season is approaching. Wu Longyue, the special commissioner of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, came to Wuxi the day before yesterday to establish interim measures for collecting a small autumn cocoon tax for the 19th year of the Republic. Article 5 stated that "the situation in Wuxi is special." Regarding the registration of the quantity of autumn cocoons, the Silk Cocoon Donation Bureau should report it every five days. Before the autumn cocoons are put on the market, all factories should be instructed to ascertain the number of spring and summer cocoons in stock, create a register, and submit it for inspection. Director Zhu of the local Silk Cocoon Donation Bureau, after receiving the order, immediately sent a letter to the Silk Factory Trade Association, instructing all factories to comply. After receiving the letter, the Association decided to convene a meeting at 3:00 PM today (30th) to discuss the measures, and yesterday sent a letter to all factories to comply with the instructions.　　Three Robbery Cases Occurred　Bandits have recently become rampant in our county, and robbery cases have occurred one after another. On the day before yesterday, three robbery cases occurred. They are recorded below: (1) A boat traveling from Wuxi to Zhutang Town, Jiangyin County, encountered a bandit boat with over ten bandits wielding guns and knives near the Kenzhuang Bridge in the Kenzhuang Tang area of the Fifth District of this county. The bandits ordered the boat to stop, fired three shots, boarded the boat, and looted extensively for half an hour before taking the loot and leaving by boat. A total of sixteen yuan in silver dollars, sixty thousand copper coins, and clothing were stolen, with a total value of over 300 yuan. (2) At 12:00 AM the night before last, Zhang Gen'er from Changzhou hired a boat to transport twenty-seven large pigs from Dingyan to Wuxi. When the boat reached the Wutang Jing area east of Shitouwan in Wan'an City, a boat suddenly approached. There were dozens of bandits on board, speaking in a strong northern accent and wielding weapons. They shouted for the boat to stop. The bandits boarded the boat, tied up Zhang Gen'er with ropes, and the boat crew Wu Xigui and Zhang Heida escaped by swimming to avoid being kidnapped. The bandits immediately looted, stealing thirteen yuan in silver dollars, one dou and five sheng of white rice, and a set of short shirts and trousers. (3) Eight bandits suddenly broke into the home of the Hu family, residents of Nangua Lane, Jincheng Bay, Yangming Township, and looted at will. The losses were not significant.</p>
<p>A Thief Was Brutally Beaten to Death　A chicken thief in Taibo City, Tu 341, was kicked in the lower abdomen by the victim a few days ago and died on the spot. The County Government examined and determined that it was a case of assault resulting in death. The day before yesterday, another thief in Tu 346 of the city was struck with an iron object and collapsed in a mulberry field along the river north of the bridge. Investigator Yu Cheng arrived to examine the body and determined that the deceased was about twenty years old, with both ankles cut by iron objects. He had died from the injuries sustained before death. Since there were no family members, the Tu Zheng was ordered to prepare a coffin and bury the body.</p>
<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>Bandits in Ping'an Town Conspire to Riot　At You time (5-7PM) on the 25th of this month, the Fourth Team of the Nanhui Datuan Town Water Public Security received a report from the Third District Office of Fengxian County, stating that eighty or ninety bandits were holding a meeting outside Ping'an Town, conspiring to riot. The Datuan Town area was sparsely defended and requested the dispatch of a team to suppress them. Team Leader Liu immediately dispatched twelve police officers to the town for defense and suppression. They then received a report stating that a crowd of bandits was indeed gathering at the Xu Jiawei enclosure outside Ping'an Town and had not dispersed, causing the residents to flee. Team Leader Liu then led thirty officers and police officers at dawn on the 26th, arriving at Ping'an Town at 9:30 AM. Coincidentally, a squad each from the Fengxian County Police Team and the Salt Police Team arrived at the same time. Team Leader Liu took command and advanced towards the Xu Jiawei enclosure. Upon approaching the enclosure, the bandits were seen in the distance, afraid to resist and fleeing in all directions. The vanguard was then ordered to circle around and surround the enclosure. Upon searching the enclosure, three key bandits, Zhang Linsheng, Ji Yunzhou, and Ji Fuxiang, were captured on the spot, while the rest were scattered and disappeared without a trace. Although the area was not ravaged, it was thoroughly alarmed.</p>

<p>Seizure of a Bandit Boat in Xuliujing　It has been reported that a large group of bandits was discovered in Xuliujing, Hupu Township, and engaged in a fierce battle with the local police team, resulting in the deaths of two police officers and one seriously injured. Now, it is reported that after the bandits retreated, Team Leader Qian Mobin led over ten officers and soldiers and seized a boat in the small path of the Xu Zhuang Bridge in the small market of Xuliujing. As a result, it was found to be a bandit boat, and the boatmen had already escaped. A triangular flag with "White Sun, Blue Sky" was found in the cabin, as well as a Mauser pistol grip cover and some bullet casings. After seizing these items, Team Leader Qian detained the boat and scheduled it to be escorted to the city tomorrow (29th). Furthermore, the injured soldier Fu Youcai, who is being treated at the Jishen Hospital, has now been examined using an X-ray, and there are no bullets remaining inside his body. His injuries are not serious, and he is expected to be discharged in about a week. Furthermore, before the police and bandits engaged in the firefight, a customs enforcement boat was overwhelmed due to the disparity in numbers, resulting in the loss of the boat, personnel, and equipment. At the time, there was no news of them. Many assumed the worst, but yesterday (28th) the customs enforcement boat returned, with the personnel and equipment intact. However, all of the bullets had been lost. It was also learned that Xia Lianfu and Cao Genbao, who were found on the bandit boat, both claimed to be kidnapped hostages. However, the police team considered them suspicious and brought them to the city to be questioned by the County Judiciary. According to Xia Yunfu's testimony, he is thirty years old and from Dongting East Mountain. On June 29th of the lunar calendar, he was kidnapped by bandits while traveling to Suzhou by boat. Because he was in the fruit business and could not afford a large ransom, the bandits ordered him to row the boat. He managed to escape during the police and bandit firefight the day before. The examining officer accepted his testimony but needed to investigate. When asked if he had any acquaintances, he replied yes, and was then released on bail. Cao Genbao testified that he was from Mudu, Suzhou, and worked as a fisherman in Taihu Lake. He and his boat were seized together on the 17th day of the lunar new year. The official considered whether Cao was a hostage and also needed to investigate. However, Cao had no acquaintances in Changshu and no means to obtain bail, so he was temporarily detained.</p>

<h3>Thirteenth Annual Conference of the</h3>
<p>Chinese Institute of Engineers (2)</p>
<p>Renamed the Chinese Engineering Society</p>
<p>Hu Shuhua Continues as President</p>
<p>(Shenyang Correspondence) The opening ceremony of the 13th annual conference of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, which was held on the 18th, has been reported in this newspaper. The conference continued on the 19th and 20th. On the 19th, Peng Jiqun, Director of the Liaoning Construction Department, gave a speech. On the 20th, Hu Shuhua, President of the Institute, arrived in Shenyang. The conference closed on the 24th. Details are reported below:</p>
<h3>Lectures and Visits: Schedule for the 19th – Morning of the Day</h3>
<p>For the expert lectures, the association had previously invited Peng Jiqun, the Director of the Construction Bureau, to speak. Peng arrived after the Provincial Committee meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM and the meeting immediately commenced. First, Chairman Yu Chichang gave an introductory speech, briefly stating that there were two reasons for holding the annual meeting in Pan: first, the Northeast has suffered from the oppression of imperialists, and it is hoped that people in the country will come to the Northeast to make efforts in propaganda; second, the construction undertakings in the Northeast have made progress in recent years compared with the interior. However, because the association’s meeting period is too short, it is not possible to invite experts familiar with the construction situation in the Northeast to give lectures so that the members can clearly understand the construction matters in the Northeast. Now, we invite Mr. Peng Jiqun to give a lecture. Mr. Peng currently holds an important position in construction and should be able to provide some guidance. Next, Mr. Peng gave a speech, roughly saying that the chairman's invitation for me to give a lecture is something I dare not presume, but it is just a casual conversation. Today, what I want to report to the annual meeting is the construction of Huludao. Unfortunately, due to the flood, traffic was cut off and the various lecture materials needed could not be obtained. Since there are no materials, there is nothing to report. I originally did not want to come, but because of everyone's persistent invitation, I had to come to learn something. Since the establishment of the Liaoning Construction Bureau one year ago, due to the limitations of authority and economy, not only have there been no achievements, but all plans have not been fully developed. Construction related to people's livelihood includes the four major elements of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. In terms of housing, China has considerable plans for architecture. In the past two or thirty years, there has been great progress in architecture that meets national needs. In terms of aesthetics, national needs are not progress, but a transformation of national evolution. Architecture is a product of the environment and cannot be forced. From south to north, China has a large number of buildings, and their beauty lies in the combination of lines. For example, the Chinese palace is delicate and beautiful, which is because the collection of lines is very good, but changing the collection of lines will lose its beauty, and it is not as beautiful as it looks in the drawing. Since China already has this characteristic that can represent the nation, the combination of lines should be the main part of Chinese architecture. During this transitional period, new buildings should be produced based on the old and the needed. However, most of the current buildings are in foreign styles and have no fixed standards. The old buildings are not enough to meet the current needs, so most buildings have become foreign styles, causing the beauty of Chinese lines to be completely lost and unable to express the characteristics of the Chinese people. In this transitional period, finding Chinese architecture that can represent Chinese national characteristics is the main task. It is hoped that the engineering profession will take on this responsibility. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon, and members had lunch at Northeast University before visiting Northeast University and the university factory, the new Shenyang Electric Lamp Factory, and the Northeast Radio Station. In the evening, Peng Jiqun hosted a banquet at the Minghu Chun Restaurant in Xiaoheyan.</p>
<p>On the 20th, Hu Shuhua, the president of the Shanghai General Association, was blocked in Tianjin due to obstacles on the Beining Railway and could not arrive in time. He arrived in Shenyang this morning and immediately participated in the conference. Chairman Yu Chichang first gave a speech, roughly saying that this year's papers are more numerous than in previous years, about thirty papers. Due to time constraints, they cannot all be read out. In addition to those who are attending the meeting reading them on the spot, the rest will be published in special issues in the future. All papers will be reviewed and published uniformly. Next, five papers were read out: 1. Discussion on the Size of Waterway Cross-Sections (Zhang Hanying); 2. Suggestion that the Current Port Size of the Huludao Port Construction Plan is Insufficient for the Original Intention of Building a Port and Must be Expanded to Avoid Regret (Fu Rui); 3. Discussion on the Recent Design of Anti-Aircraft Guns (Zhang Junhe); 4. Military Radio-Controlled Machines (Du Desan); 5. Theory of the Plan to Divert the Huai River into the Yangtze River and the Sea (Wang Huzhen). The meeting adjourned after the above readings, and it was already noon. At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, members gathered at Northeast University and first visited the Mortar Factory. The factory director reported on the organization of the factory. Then, they were divided into four groups to visit the entire factory. After the visit was completed at 3:00 PM, they continued to visit the Beining Railway Machine Factory and the Beining Railway Liaoning General Station. At 7:00 PM in the evening, Sun Guofeng, the Dean of the College of Science and Engineering of Northeast University, represented Northeast University and hosted a banquet for all members at the Houdefu Restaurant.</p>

The session adjourned at 12:00 noon for lunch. The business meeting continued at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, chaired by Hu Shuhua and recorded by Yu Chichang.

<h3>City Education Bureau Informs that</h3>

<h3>Renovation of Shanghai Law School</h3>
<p>Since Mr. Chu Huiseng and Mr. Shen Hengshan took over the Shanghai Law School on Jiangwan Road, they have worked hard to develop and actively rectify the school. The new school building has been completed, and the main entrance and auditorium are also under construction and planning. The interior has been perfected. Recently, as the trial period has expired, it is necessary to apply for registration. Therefore, various registration forms were rushed to be completed during the summer vacation. Last week, all of them were completed. Shen, the Dean of Academic Affairs of the school, personally delivered the official documents, registration forms, and attachments to the Municipal Education Bureau, and requested that they be forwarded to the Ministry of Education for review as soon as possible, which was approved. The faculty and staff of the school have undergone slight changes this semester. Zhao Yunyi, the head of the Law Department, resigned due to personal reasons. The school authorities tried their best to retain him, but he only agreed to continue teaching. The position of head has been taken over by Dai Junliang, who was hired by the school.

The head of the Economics Department is still held by He Dekui. There have also been slight changes to the professors in other departments, and many revisions have been made to the curriculum. In accordance with the university regulations, a new curriculum schedule has been formulated, and the first-year students are not divided into departments, which will be implemented from the first year. In addition, the affiliated middle school has now moved into the university department. Zhang, the former director, has resigned, and there is no suitable person to take over at the moment, so the Dean of Academic Affairs of the university department will temporarily serve concurrently. In the future, in terms of moral education, in addition to implementing the theories of the Three People's Principles and the educational purpose of the National Government, emphasis will also be placed on the cultivation of morality and the shaping of personality. Director Shen has hired Geng Boyang to serve concurrently in moral education affairs, and thirteen people have been hired from among the faculty and staff to serve as moral education committee members. It is said that a meeting will be held in the university department of the school on the afternoon of the 9th to discuss the matter.</p>

<h3>Rotary Cup Finals, Day 1</h3>
<p>China Defeats England in Two Singles Matches</p>
<p>Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai Both Win in Straight Sets</p>
<p>China and England will Play Doubles Match This Afternoon at 4:00 PM</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Tennis Rotary Cup was the first day of the Sino-British championship yesterday. Although it rained heavily the night before, fortunately it cleared up yesterday morning, and the venue gradually dried up until 4:00 PM in the afternoon, and the competition was able to proceed as usual. Moreover, the autumn breeze was refreshing, and the heat was reduced, and a large number of spectators arrived, no less than six or seven hundred people. The players were also very excited, but the grass was slightly wet, the ball lost its elasticity, and the weight of five points was increased, which was actually a lot of degradation, but the competitive situation was still tense, especially the match between Lin Saihua and White, which was the most intense. Our country won all two singles matches, both with a straight-set score of 3.</p>
<p>6 | 3</p>
<p>(1) Lin Baohua (China) 6 | 4 White (England)</p>
<p>6 | 2</p>
<p>Lin Baohua and Jiang Daozhang arrived at the venue the earliest and practiced first. It wasn't until 4:15 that the Englishman White staggered onto the court. After stretching his muscles, Lin and White began the match.</p>
<h3>First Set White Served First, Smashed Vigorously, Winning the First Game</h3>
<p>Lin then used his accurate and quick serves and draws from near and far, which were unstoppable, making White unable to run around. The audience was very interested and cheered loudly, so he also returned a game, tying it up 1-1. Later, White's serve made repeated mistakes, and Lin added another game, taking the lead with 2-1. In the fourth game, Lin's serve unexpectedly failed with a slip of four, which was unexpected, because Lin has always been good at serving. At this point, the score became 2-2. Afterwards, Lin's spirit was revitalized, and he was able to handle the game with ease, winning two games in a row. White tried his best to counterattack, but only managed to claw back one game. Afterwards, Lin won two more games, winning the first set 6-3.</p>
<h3>Second Set Lin Won the First Game with a Serve. White Relied On</h3>
<p>his many years of experience, he often had outstanding performances, and his forehand draw was very good. Unfortunately, he lacked confidence in the forehand and still failed to make any achievements. In the third game, White also lost with a net score of 4, bringing Lin's lead to 3-0. White tried to retaliate, only winning one game. However, his fighting spirit did not diminish, and he was very resilient. In the next game, the two fought fiercely. Lin lost three points first on his serve, and then tied it up. They were deadlocked and it was difficult to tell who was better. After five or six ties, the game was finally decided, with Lin leading 4-1. After that, they each won a game, making it 5-2. Seeing that the situation was not good, White tried to counterattack. Sure enough, he was old but still strong, and he achieved success in skin grafting and created two consecutive games. The number of games was close, and White was aggressive and ambitious. How could Lin Baohua relax? After a few rounds, the final set was over, with Lin winning 6-4.</p>
<h3>Third Set At the Beginning, Both Sides Were Listless, White's</h3>
<p>energy gradually declined, and Baohua was not strained. After White won the first game, Lin suddenly showed his power again, and his drawing and volleying were both wonderful. In the blink of an eye, three points were scored in a row. White was unwilling to show weakness, and after the storm the night before, he saw the light of day again, and suddenly his spirits were lifted, and he struggled hard, exerting all his strength to win back a game. However, the situation was like a flood, and it was difficult to recover. Lin completed it in one go, winning 6-2.</p>
<p>6 | 3</p>
<p>(2) Qiu Feihai (China) 6 | 0 Brown (England)</p>
<p>6 | 1</p>
<p>The match between Qiu Feihai and Brown started slightly later. Qiu is a famous general in our country, but yesterday he did not perform well due to the slightly wet court. However, his ball skills were very strange, sometimes far, sometimes near, sometimes left, sometimes right. Brown was old and weak, and his body was clumsy, making it difficult for him to run around. The spectators were very anxious. At the end of the three sets, Brown was exhausted and panting like a cow. However, the score was still good, and his serve and smash were still successful, so he was able to win four games.</p>
<h3>First Set Brown Served First, Winning the First</h3>
<p>Game. Afterwards, Qiu won three games in a row. Although Brown's skills were not as good, he was unwilling to show weakness and worked hard, and was able to tie the score 3-3, which was no easy task. Qiu then acted cautiously and finally won 6-3.</p>
<h3>Second Set Qiu Fought Steadily, Rarely Wasted Shots, And Did His Best</h3>
<p>to be Cunning, Making It Difficult for Brown to Parry, Let Alone Attack. He Lost Again and Again, and Qiu Won the Long Set 6-0.</p>
<h3>Third Set Brown's Energy Had Declined and He Had No Intention of Fighting,</h3>
<p>Qiu Had a Smooth Run and Won Five Games in a Row. At This Point, Brown Struggled Like a Cornered Beast and Won Back a Game to Save Face. As a Result, Qiu Won 6-1.</p>
<h3>Today's Doubles Match</h3>
<p>Lin and Qiu Will Play at 4:00 PM</p>
<p>Today is the second day of the Sino-British final, with only one doubles match. It has not yet been decided whether our country's players will be Lin and Qiu or Zheng Zhaojia and Jiang Daozhang. The British players are White and Stock. It is scheduled to start at 4:00 PM. The British team's strength is also considerable, and there should be a good performance at that time.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Table Tennis Team Defeats Golden Star</h3>
<p>Last night, the Hong Kong champion table tennis team played against the Shanghai San Ding team Golden Star for the sixth time at the Jiande Hall. There were five or six hundred spectators. When the clock struck eight, Lu Shentong, Lu Xiulu, Yu Binqi, etc. were assigned positions and the match began. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong Golden Star Results Winner</p>
<p>Zeng Yingfu Ruan Yaohui 1 | 3 Golden Star Chen Yingting Wang Jingen 3 | 1 Hong Kong Huo Xianchao Hu Baochu 3 | 2 Hong Kong Deng Yaopeng Ye Quangen 3 | 1 Hong Kong Mo Yingqing Wu Maoqing 3 | 1 Hong Kong Huang Wuping Wu Zhiheng 3 | 0 Hong Kong Huo Xianchao Xiao Rangtian 3 | 2 Hong Kong</p>
<p>Brief Comment on the Ball Skills In the match between Zeng and Ruan, Zeng, as the captain of the Hong Kong team, worked very hard. Ruan is a veteran who has been fighting for a long time, but he has been out of practice for a long time. He lost in the first round. In the second round, Ruan's ball skills became more proficient, and he attacked from the east and west, causing Zeng to be unable to take care of everything and lose the game. In the second match, Wang Jingen faced Chen Yingting, who had won the Guangzhou Individual Championship. Chen's ball skills have greatly improved compared to the past. He attacks from the left and right, and is suitable for both near and far, and is extremely lively, making it difficult for Wang to cope. The third match was between the new famous general Hu Baochu and Huo Xianchao, who defeated the Japanese team's strong players the night before. When the two heroes met, there was applause everywhere. Hu worked even harder, attacking more and more bravely. Huo, on the other hand, advanced and retreated in an orderly manner, and occasionally attacked when Hu was unprepared, and finally succeeded. In the fourth match, Ye Quangen faced Deng Yaopeng. Ye's ball draws were too fierce, often leading to suicide, resulting in defeat at the hands of Deng, who was good at defense. The fifth match was between Wu Maoqing, who is famous throughout Shanghai, and Mo Qinghuan. Both sides were at a critical juncture of victory or defeat, so they were both careful and fought hard. The cowhide candy ball was stacked up, highlighting Wu's strengths. Ying defended properly, and Wu lost the first round. In the second round, Wu knew the opportunity to counterattack, but the opponent hit with a near ball, resulting in another failure. In the third round, Wu attacked and defended properly and won a round, making the score 2-1. In the fourth round, Wu tried his luck with a draw, but Mo was alive and well, writing and drawing, blocking closer and closer, and getting the final advantage. The Hong Kong team had won four games, and the overall situation was set. In the sixth and seventh matches, Golden Star had no intention of fighting back, so they lost.</p>

<p>More Than 100,000 People Attended, and the Atmosphere Was Extremely Tense</p>
<p>Seven Major Proposals Were Passed, and Personnel Were Sent to Comfort the Soldiers</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the people of this city held the Shanghai Municipal Civic Assembly to Eradicate Communism, Punish Treason, and Celebrate Victory at the Nanshi Public Sports Ground. More than 500 groups and more than 100,000 people attended. Due to the rain, those from areas farther from the city, such as Jiangwan, Pudong, and Xujiahui, were unable to participate, but there were no fewer than 80,000 to 90,000 people. Although there was continuous autumn rain, the spirit of the people in the field was still very excited, the team was well-organized, and the order was orderly. The presidium of the conference promoted Yang Qingyuan to report the meaning of the conference and the efforts that should be made. Then, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Yansong, Yu Hongjun, Hou Dachun, Yang Youren, and others gave generous speeches one after another. The people were greatly moved, and the atmosphere in the field was extremely tense. Then, the proposals were discussed, slogans were shouted, and the meeting was adjourned and a parade began. The various situations are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Venue Arrangement</h3>
<p>Three platforms were set up in the venue, with the center one serving as the command platform. A banner reading "Shanghai Citizens' Rally Celebrating the Victory of Suppressing Communists and Punishing Rebels" was hung horizontally. On the left and right, slogans such as "The revolution has not yet succeeded; comrades must continue to work hard" were displayed. Above the platform, the portrait of the Premier and the flag of the Party and the nation were hung, along with the rally's agenda and slogans. The right platform was the general command platform, displaying three large banners with slogans such as "Down with Wang Jingwei, the traitor who colludes with Soviet Russia and fawns on Yan and Feng." The left platform was the general inspection platform, displaying large banners such as "Extending greetings to the revolutionary soldiers at the front lines for their hard work and great achievements." All around the venue, slogans celebrating the victory of suppressing communists and punishing rebels were prominently posted. The propaganda materials prepared by the rally organizers and the Municipal Executive Committee were also quite rich, including special issues celebrating the victory of suppressing communists and punishing rebels, leaflets, slogans, small red and green banners, and letters to the public and comrades, totaling more than twenty types.</p>

<h3>Chairman's Report Fellow compatriots, today we have gathered</h3>
<p>the people from all walks of life in the city here to hold a citizens' rally celebrating the victory of suppressing communists and punishing rebels. Why are we holding this rally? In a smaller sense, it is for individuals to seek survival and for society to seek order and peace. In a larger sense, it is for the nation to seek prosperity and for the country to seek independence, freedom, and equality. Since the Northern Expeditionary Army set out to unify the country, the Nanjing National Government should have been able to inherit the Premier's teachings and the policies of the Chinese Nationalist Party to build a new China, relieve the people's suffering, and seek all happiness for the people. However, since the completion of the Northern Expedition, the people's suffering has not been relieved, and the cause of construction has not even begun. The reason for this is the rebellions of all the new and old warlords and the sabotage of the communist bandits, which have led to workers having no work to do, farmers having no land to cultivate, and students having no books to read due to the Chinese Communist Party's destructive actions. Three years have passed since the establishment of the Nanjing National Government, yet our people's suffering has not been relieved, and the Three Principles of the People have still not been realized. Today, after painful reflection, we deeply recognize that our greatest enemies are the reactionary warlords who betray the central government and the communist bandits who kill and set fires. Therefore, the significance of our citizens' rally today can be said to be for individuals to seek survival, for society to seek order and peace, and for the nation and people to seek prosperity, independence, and freedom. Now, the Yan and Feng warlords are raising troops and rebelling in the north, and the communist bandits are killing and setting fires in Changsha, Jiangxi, and other places. The entire China is in a terrible situation. The Chinese Nationalist Party, which bears the responsibility of building, governing, and saving the country, of course, has to do its utmost to eliminate these rebellious and traitorous reactionary forces. Thanks to the brave advance of the soldiers at the front lines and the enthusiastic support of the people across the country, the war at the front has been very victorious. Recently, the Central Punitive Expeditionary Army has wiped out Jinan and Tai'an in one fell swoop, and there has also been great progress on the Ping-Han and Long-Hai railways. Therefore, the elimination of the Yan and Feng warlords is not far off. The communists in Changsha, Jiangxi, and other places will also be completely suppressed after the central government dispatches large armies. We, the compatriots and comrades in the rear, in addition to helping the central government to extinguish all reactionary warlords, at the same time, our people should also express their ardent support for the central government, punish rebels, and eliminate the communists. Therefore, we are holding this citizens' rally here today to unanimously eliminate the Chinese Communist Party, which kills, sets fires, and colludes with Soviet Russia, and to overthrow the Yan and Feng warlords, who are traitors, bring disaster to the country, and harm the people. And we celebrate the victory of the punitive expeditionary soldiers at the front. This is my report.</p>
<h3>Rally Proposals</h3>
<p>A declaration was passed during the rally, along with seven proposals, all of which were read aloud by Chairman Yang Qingyuan on the spot and unanimously approved by the audience. The declaration is recorded later, and the proposals are as follows: (1) Send a telegram to comfort Generalissimo Chiang and all the soldiers at the front, and request them to advance victoriously and thoroughly eliminate the rebel enemies. Resolved and passed. (2) Send a telegram to the National Government, urging them to quickly dispatch large armies to thoroughly eliminate the communist bandits. Resolved and passed. (3) Send a telegram to urge Deputy Commander Zhang of the Northeast to send troops to punish the rebels. Resolved and passed. (4) Send a telegram to inform the soldiers of the former Second and Third Army Groups to consciously return. Resolved and passed. (5) Send a telegram to request the national press to uphold justice and help quell the rebellion. Resolved and passed. (6) Send a telegram to the governments of various countries to explain the significance of this punitive expedition against the rebels and communists. Resolved and passed. (The original text of the above six telegrams is recorded later). (7) Request the Municipal Party Department to forward to the Central Government to abide by the Premier's agricultural and industrial policies, protect labor groups, and implement relief for unemployed workers to avoid giving reactionary elements the opportunity to incite them. Resolved and requested the Municipal Party Department to verify and handle it.</p>
<h3>Delegation of Comfort</h3>
<p>In addition to sending a special telegram to comfort Generalissimo Chiang and the punitive expeditionary generals and soldiers, the rally also appointed Yu Heqing, Li Denghui, Tao Baichuan, Ma Yuying, Lu Jingshi, Gu Yongquan, and other six people as rally representatives to go to the front to comfort all the punitive expeditionary soldiers.</p>
<h3>Rally Slogans (1) Eliminate the Chinese Communist Party, (2)</h3>
<p>Eradicate the Yan and Feng warlords, (3) Down with Wang Jingwei, the traitor, (4) Eliminate all reactionaries, (5) Comfort the soldiers at the front, (6) Relieve the suffering of the people, (7) Protect the interests of the people, (8) Achieve peaceful unification, (9) Support Generalissimo Chiang, (10) Support the Nanjing National Government, (11) Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party, (12) Long live the success of the National Revolution, (13) Long live the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Grand Parade After the rally adjourned, the</h3>
<p>teams were organized for a parade. Led by the Municipal Public Security Bureau's military band, the defense corps, and the general commander's car, followed by women's groups, student groups, business groups, etc., about 20,000 people. The route went out of the Old West Gate, along Minguo Road, to the Little East Gate, where the teams dispersed. The teams were well-organized, the order was orderly, and the sound of slogans continued endlessly.</p>
<h3>Rally Declaration The country is in distress, and disasters</h3>
<p>and chaos follow one another. The poison has spread, destroying rural areas, closing factories, hindering commercial transportation, and declining education. In the northwestern provinces, there are thousands of miles of red land, and the starving are everywhere, the situation is especially tragic. At this difficult time, all those with blood and vigor should endure for the country and strive to be heroes to maintain the situation of peace and unity and establish the foundation of political tutelage and construction. However, the rebels of Feng and Yan have no such plans. Instead, they dare to take advantage of this opportunity of difficulties both above and below to indulge their great desires to bring disaster to the country and harm the people, to use soldiers in the Central Plains, to add to the suffering of our people. And Wang Jingwei, who has always called himself a revolutionary, is also taking the opportunity to stir up trouble, colluding with the Communist Party, recruiting bandits, and wreaking havoc in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. The raging flames of Changsha terrify those who hear of it. The unprecedented catastrophe causes heaven and earth to grieve. The suffering of the people has reached its extreme. Fortunately, our central authorities have people in charge and are responding in a proper way. And Generalissimo Chiang is marching through the long summer, working hard to kill the bandits. The communist bandits fled in the battle of Changsha. Jinan was struck with one blow, and Tianjin was shaken. The time to plow the court and sweep the caves is not far off. The city foxes and shrine rats will be destroyed immediately. All the citizens of Shanghai have repeatedly heard the good news, and they are very happy and gratified. They are uniting their efforts and are willing to be the backing. We hereby unanimously resolve at today's rally: (1) Send a telegram to comfort Generalissimo Chiang and request the soldiers at the front to advance victoriously. (2) Send a telegram to the National Government to send troops to suppress the communists. (3) Send a telegram to urge Deputy Commander Zhang of the Northeast to send troops to punish the rebels. (4) Send a telegram to inform the soldiers of the former Second and Third Army Groups to consciously return. (5) Send a telegram to request the national press to uphold justice and help quell the rebellion. (6) Send a telegram to the governments of various countries to explain the significance of the punitive expedition against the rebels and communists. We deeply hope that our compatriots across the country will extend their righteous indignation, unanimously advocate, and rely on it for the future of the country. This is our declaration. Shanghai Rally Celebrating the Victory of Suppressing Communists and Punishing Rebels.</p>
<h3>Rally Telegrams (1) Telegram of Comfort to Generalissimo Chiang and the Soldiers at the Front</h3>
<p>(Titles omitted) Since Yan and Feng initiated the rebellion, the whole country has been united in hatred. Disasters follow one another, and the people suffer. And Wang Jingwei, the traitor, has gathered the dregs of society, gathered together a group of ugly people. He has already sold himself to the warlords and has not forgotten Soviet Russia. He instigated Zhang and Gui, intending to interfere in Wuhan, and colluded with the communist bandits to shed blood in Changsha again. Fortunately, you, sir, were ordered to punish the rebels, and your command was proper. The people supported you, and the soldiers obeyed your orders. You recovered Changsha, wiped out the ugly people, and restored Jinan, and you are attacking the rebel nest in the north. All the citizens of Shanghai have repeatedly heard the good news and are overjoyed. At today's rally, we unanimously resolved to send a telegram to express our condolences and to order the soldiers at the front to pursue the victory. The remnant enemies are at the end of their rope, and suppressing them is like the autumn wind sweeping away leaves. We send this telegram in haste and look forward to your triumphant return. Shanghai Citizens' Rally Celebrating the Victory of Suppressing Communists and Punishing Rebels. (1) Telegram urging Deputy Commander Zhang to send troops to punish the rebels (Titles omitted) The two rebels, Yan and Feng, are fickle and bellicose. They are the remnants of the warlords and the culmination of speculation and opportunism. They only know how to expand their territory and disregard the interests of the nation. They connect with Soviet Russia to be the great servants of imperialism, and they connect with Zhang and Gui to extend the feudal situation. They are increasingly arrogant, and their aura is increasing. If they are not punished by national law, how can their ferocity be punished? Our central government is seeking a peaceful and unified situation, and it is sending out troops to punish the rebels and quell the chaos. It has also appointed you, comrade, as the deputy commander. It was originally hoped that you would send out troops nearby to eliminate the rebel atmosphere as soon as possible. However, many days have passed, and there has been no news of your assumption of office. You must know that right and wrong are clear, and obedience and disobedience are distinguished. The country is in the midst of difficulties, and it is a time to wear hair down and hats. The rebel atmosphere has been revealed, and it is not a time to hesitate and watch. Advance and retreat are decided in an instant, and merit and crime are written in the ages. It is hoped that you, comrade, will assume office as soon as possible and mobilize on time to launch a heroic army to quell the chaos and punish the rebels and to achieve the great achievements of protecting the Party and saving the country, washing away the traces of rebellion in the north, so that the people of the four borders of Yan, Qi, Qin, and Jin can be revived, and quelling the smoke of war in the Central Plains, so that the waves of the rivers and lakes can be calmed as soon as possible. The great cause of unification can be expected, and the foundation of peace can be solidified forever. The telegram is urgent, and there is no end to our expectation. Shanghai Citizens' Rally Celebrating the Victory of Suppressing Communists and Punishing Rebels. (1) Telegram requesting the National Government to send troops to suppress the communists (Titles omitted) Since the Yan and Feng rebellion, the communist bandits in Hunan and Jiangxi have been used by Wang Jingwei, the traitor, to kill, set fires, rape, and loot, doing everything. Wherever the poison reaches, the scars are full of eyes. The victims are everywhere. If this harm is not removed, the country and nation will not be able to protect themselves, and the suffering of the people will not be relieved. The catastrophe of Changsha can serve as a warning. You are sitting in the central area and are clear about everything. The strategy of suppressing the communists has been determined. We hope that you will quickly dispatch large armies to suppress the communist bandits in Hunan and Jiangxi and order the local military and political authorities to unanimously search and arrest them, to use the river to cover up the beacon fire, to calm the wind and waves, to lay down arms, to stabilize the country, to eliminate the buds of medicine, and to achieve peace together. We express our urgent words and are waiting for orders. Shanghai Citizens' Rally Celebrating the Victory of Suppressing Communists and Punishing Rebels. (1) Telegram to the national press to uphold justice and condemn the rebels. All newspapers in the country are hereby informed: Unfortunately, the Party and the country are in turmoil. Fortunately, our central authorities have people in charge and are responding in a timely manner. In the past few months, news of victories has been flying in. Recently, Jinan has been recovered, Changsha has been restored, and a direct attack on Huanglong is not far off. All the newspapers in our country, as representatives of social opinion and leaders of public thought, should, at this difficult time, correct their vision and hearing, unify their will, distinguish right from wrong, uphold justice, support the central government, and condemn the rebels. In fact, there are many who have a correct attitude on the facts, but there are also those who hesitate and are afraid to act. This is not what we expect from the representatives of public opinion. Gentlemen are wise and must understand this meaning. Public opinion will not perish. We also hope that you will protect your good name. We represent the 2.8 million citizens of Shanghai. Shanghai Citizens' Rally Celebrating the Victory of Suppressing Communists and Punishing Rebels. (2) Telegram to the soldiers of the former Second and Third Army Groups to abandon the rebels and return to obedience. All the soldiers of the former Second and Third Army Groups are hereby informed: Since the central army recovered Jinan, Yan Xishan has reached the end of his road, and the large army is pursuing the victory. How can Feng Yuxiang be spared? The revolutionary army, mixed with the central government, to engage in destroying peace and unity, will inevitably suffer self-destruction. From Li Zongren to Tang Shengzhi to Wan Xuancai and Fan Zhongxiu, all are the same. At this time when Yan and Feng are about to be destroyed, it is an opportunity for all the generals and soldiers to rein in their horses at the precipice. If they can correct themselves now, abandon the rebels and return to obedience, then peace will be immediately realized, and the people's difficulties will be relieved. All the generals and soldiers will still not lose their status as strong revolutionary men. If they are still unrepentant, they are willing to be rebels, adding to the suffering of our people. Then, the punishment for bringing disaster to the country and harming the people will not wait for the central government. All of our generals and soldiers have been engaged in the revolution for many years. This time, they were coerced into joining the rebels. At this time when the large army is advancing, we dare to offer our sincere advice. What to do, what to follow, we hope you will decide early. We are deeply concerned. Shanghai Citizens' Rally Celebrating the Victory of Suppressing Communists and Punishing Rebels. (1) Telegram to the world's nations to explain the meaning of punishing the rebels (Titles omitted) Since our country completed the Northern Expedition and the whole country was unified, the people of the whole country have been looking forward to governance, and the people of friendly countries have applauded and said that the construction of a new China can be expected in the near future. Who would have thought that something unexpected would happen? Yan Xishan, Feng Yuxiang, and others suddenly rebelled in the spring of this year. Due to the propaganda of the reactionary parties, the international community did not understand the true situation and thought that the foundation of the country was just beginning to be established, and there was another war, and internal strife was frequent. There will be no day of tranquility. In fact, Yan and Feng's rebellion this time was entirely under the instructions of the Third International, and all military supplies were also provided by the Third International. Even the soldiers in the northwest were trained by Soviet personnel. Recently, they colluded with the communist bandits to attack Changsha, killing and setting fires, which is unbearable to hear. All of these things have been heard by all countries. Therefore, the war in China this time is actually a war between communism and anti-communism, and the truth is clear. Now the central government has dispatched large armies to suppress them in different directions. The wind is sweeping away the clouds, and success is not far off. We also hope that enlightened people in friendly countries will correct their vision and hearing, clearly distinguish between obedience and disobedience, so that evil words have no way to enter, and the reactionary parties have no way to succeed. We send this telegram in haste and hope that you will observe it. Shanghai Citizens' Rally Celebrating the Victory of Suppressing Communists and Punishing Rebels.</p>
<h3>New Shanghai Telegraph Bureau Director</h3>
<p>Song Shuqiao Resigns</p>
<p>Chen Xizeng Still Maintains the Bureau</p>
<p>The newly appointed director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, Song Shuqiao (29), telegraphed to Shanghai, tendering his resignation to Minister Wang. He stated that after being appointed, he should have obeyed the order to go, but he thought that Shanghai was a place where Chinese and foreigners lived together, and the situation was complicated. At this time of military period, telecommunications are especially important. It is difficult to expect great results without long-term talent. He humbly believes that his talent and position are both inadequate, and he has been suffering from illness for two years, and he has not yet recovered. It is difficult to bear this heavy burden. He specifically presents his humble feelings and asks to resign from the position of director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau to give way to the worthy.</p>
<p>Chen Xizeng, after resolutely resigning from the position of general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, still went to the Telegraph Bureau as usual to work yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, our reporter visited him. According to Chen's statement, he had no confidence in the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Even if he raised tens of thousands of yuan, it would only be enough to maintain it for a while, not a permanent solution. Therefore, from beginning to end, he expressed that he would not take the position. As for the position of director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, he should try to maintain it before there is a replacement. Now that Song Shuqiao has resigned, Chen's re-election is not a problem.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>The General Manager Issue is Resolved</p>
<p>Li Zhonggong's Succession will be Announced</p>
<p>Since the issue of the succession of the general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company arose, many important events in the bureau have been delayed as a result, and there is no way to solve the main economic problems. Yesterday, it was heard that the succession of the general manager has been determined by the central government. The information obtained is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Chen Xizeng's Resignation Approved Chen Xizeng, after being ordered to succeed</h3>
<p>as the general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, decided not to do it because he had no confidence in the affairs of the bureau. Chen went to the capital in person and resigned to Minister of Communications Wang Boqun. It is now heard that Minister Wang has approved it. As for Chen's position as director of the Telegraph Bureau, he can probably return to it.</p>
<h3>Li Zhonggong's Succession The position of general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>must be filled by someone with both prestige and ability to be competent. After Chen submitted his resignation, it was confirmed that Minister of Communications Wang Boqun had recommended Li Zhonggong, the vice minister of communications, to succeed as the general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and had obtained Li's consent. It has been submitted to the State Council and can be announced and confirmed in one or two days.</p>
<h3>Cai Ziping Returns to the Bureau Acting General Manager Cai Pei, for the</h3>
<p>case of Jinliyuan Wharf and Sandetang, went to Beijing to meet Minister Wang, reported the process, and urged the successor to take over as soon as possible. Later, Cai heard that the new general manager had been submitted to the ministry, so he returned to Shanghai immediately. Yesterday, he had arrived at the bureau to take charge. He told the reporter that before the new general manager arrived, the affairs of the bureau would still be his responsibility. Cai also told the reporter that the arbitrator of Jinliyuan Wharf sent by Sandetang had a strong attitude and insisted on the court's decision as a step forward. The bureau decided to use diplomatic means to contact the French Consul Gange Lin. Under the meeting with the French Consul yesterday, there was progress, but in fact it cannot be announced.</p>
<h3>Jinliyuan Case</h3>
<p>Father Gao Shuo Will Meet Today</p>
<p>Introduced by the French Consul to Directly Exchange Opinions</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency said that in the Jinliyuan Wharf case, because the French arbitrator Yamina acted as an arbitrator to enforce the abolition of the contract, the arbitration to maintain the original contract renewal has not yet begun. The other day, Lawyer Gao Shuo went to visit the French Consul General Gange Lin to negotiate the case in good faith. Because Mr. Gan could not talk fully due to the matter, Lawyer Gao then accompanied Liu Yun, deputy director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to the French Consulate at 4:00 pm yesterday to meet with Mr. Gan to discuss the scope of the arbitration and the date of commencement of the arbitration. Mr. Gan made a sincere statement and agreed to have Mr. Gan come forward to introduce Lawyer Gao to the priest of Sandetang to exchange opinions directly in advance, hoping to resolve it as soon as possible. It is heard that Lawyer Gao is scheduled to meet with the priest of Sandetang today.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Whether to maintain the original contract and start arbitration depends on the attitude of the French priest. Otherwise, it will still not be out of the way to resolve it by diplomatic methods.</p>
<h3>Wang Jiazhen Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Stayed Briefly to Pick Up Family and Go to Beijing</p>
<p>Wang Jiazhen, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Shanghai by express train from Beijing at 9:20 last night. It is said that he stayed in Shanghai briefly to pick up his family and go to Beijing. He said that he had not heard of the various rumors spread by the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Lin Baike Returned to Shanghai from Guangdong</h3>

<h3>Short-Term Customs New Bonds</h3>
<p>Customs has Allocated 1 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the National Government's short-term customs new bonds of 50 million yuan stipulate that a portion should be returned from the increased tax items collected by the customs each month. These bonds have not yet been issued because the subscription method has not been agreed upon. According to reliable sources, the customs has paid the first batch of funds for the principal and interest of the bonds to the Central Bank on Wednesday, and the amount is said to be 1 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Maoye Shanghai Notes Have Redemption News</h3>
<p>Since the Maoye Bank in this port stopped business, all the one-yuan notes in circulation were redeemed in batches last year, but the five-yuan and ten-yuan notes have not yet been redeemed. Last time, it was originally intended to use the 600,000 yuan from the sale of the Shanghai branch's houses to redeem the notes, but the money was deducted by a creditor, so the redemption of the notes could not be realized. Now, because the Suzhou Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, requesting the Bankers' Association to urge the redemption, the Ministry of Finance heard this news and decided that the bank's notes were mostly in the hands of ordinary people and had been suspended for a long time. In order to take care of the people's difficulties, it ordered the bank to quickly raise funds to redeem the notes circulating in Shanghai. After the Shanghai notes are recovered, it will order the opening of the Tianjin and Hankou ports to redeem the notes.</p>
<h3>Goods Exported to the United States</h3>
<p>Must Indicate the Country of Origin</p>
<p>Otherwise, a Fine will be Imposed</p>
<p>The North China Pacific Freight Conference recently jointly announced to Chinese and foreign shippers with the New York Freight Conference, saying that according to Article 304 of the new tariff bill established by the United States on June 17, goods imported into the United States in the future must clearly indicate the country of origin in English in a conspicuous place on the goods themselves, the containers, and the outer packaging. The identification method can be manufacturing on the object, stamping, branding, or labeling, but it must be permanent and not easily damaged. If there are indeed inconvenient or impossible identification situations, it must be specially approved by the US Treasury Department. Otherwise, it must be extracted from the customs warehouse after the goods are marked and must pay an additional 10% of the value of the tariff. If there is destruction, alteration, or concealment of this mark, a fine of no more than 5,000 yuan may be imposed, or imprisonment of less than one year, or both. This law took effect 60 days after its establishment and is now being implemented.</p>
<h3>China Loses a Pioneer in the Educational Circle</h3>
<p>Mr. Yuan Guanlan Xitao, a pioneer in the Chinese educational circle, has always been in good health. Recently, he was accidentally suffering from intestinal disease. The doctor thought it was enteritis and he was bedridden for more than ten days. He died at 6 pm on the 29th of this month, at the age of 65. He was diligent in service throughout his life and was desolate after his death. Those who heard it regretted it.</p>
<h3>Calligrapher Mr. Zeng Nongran Passed Away</h3>
<p>Mr. Zeng Nongran of Hengyang passed away on the 27th of this month. It is said that he was caused by the summer heat this year. Mr. Zeng was a famous calligrapher and painter in Shanghai. The art world was shocked to hear the sad news and was deeply saddened. The coffin was placed in the coffin yesterday, and hundreds of calligraphers and painters, such as Cheng Zida, Yao Yuqin, and Kuang Youhan, went to mourn.</p>
<h3>Madam Xiong's Funeral Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Starting from the Funeral Home at 9:00 AM</p>
<p>Gu Zhujun, the wife of Xiong Shihui, the commander of the Songhu Garrison, passed away. The spirit was temporarily suspended at the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road. The details have been recorded in the previous report. Now it is learned that Xiong's residence is not convenient to stay in the museum for a long time. It has been decided to move to Pingjiang Public Office at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow (31st). The military bands of the 5th Division of the Garrison Department and the Public Security Bureau will participate. The 5th Division will also send troops to escort. The mourners will all wear summer cloth gowns and black gauze on their arms. Xiong's residence will be simplified as much as possible and will not notify all walks of life. However, Xiong has been stationed in Shanghai for several years, and he has many relatives and friends. At that time, there must be a grand occasion of plain cars and white horses.</p>
<h3>Silk Merchants Request Improvements to Raw Silk Inspection</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has established a Raw Silk Inspection Office and has been piloting public quantity inspection for several months. However, the silk factories in Shanghai have suffered losses in most cases due to this public quantity inspection, and their capabilities have been stretched. They have publicly requested the Shanghai Silk Factories Association to send a letter to the Commodity Inspection Bureau, inquiring in detail about the actual reasons for the losses, in order to seek thorough improvement. The letter states: "To whom it may concern, our association has repeatedly received reports from member silk factories, stating that since the establishment of the Raw Silk Inspection Office by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau and the pilot implementation of public quantity inspection for several months, the original intention was indeed to maintain fairness in buying and selling and to establish the credibility of international trade. Therefore, at the beginning of its establishment, various silk factories were willing to pay fees and welcomed the convenience. However, after the public quantity trial, the losses suffered by various silk factories far exceeded those before the public quantity, and the magnitude of the losses was shocking. This has only added losses and burdens to the silk factories. Considering the original intention of maintenance, it is the opposite. If we continue to sit idly by, the situation is worrying. Our members feel deeply affected and cannot remain silent. They request immediate relief, etc. Upon investigation, this matter has been repeatedly studied by the industry, and doubts have arisen. If it is said to be related to climate and humidity, then products produced at the same time with the same equipment have different results. Regarding Shanghai's factory silk with the most stable humidity and the driest silk, none is better than the products of Xinchang Silk Factory. This is known and heard by both Chinese and foreign silk merchants. However, they also experience losses. Other factories are even more so. Public quantity inspection originated in Japan and the United States, and there is much to learn from them. However, on the one hand, we should conduct in-depth research, and on the other hand, we should pay attention to the occurrence of malpractices. Thinking back to twenty-five years ago, Edison invented the electric light. At first, the light was dim and red, but he was determined to improve it, and now it is bright and white. This shows that scientific progress has no end. We cannot adhere to established methods and consider them as standards. Now, the examiners appointed by your department are presumably experienced. However, unfortunately, the silk factories unanimously express their losses and send letters of complaint like snowflakes. It is truly perplexing. In short, the purpose of this matter is to gain the trust of foreign merchants and ensure the safety of factory operations. All manufacturers will never dare to groan without illness or intentionally criticize. Our association is a public organization, and seeing the anger of the public, we have to carefully consider the opportunity. Therefore, at the ninth committee meeting on the 28th of this month, it was resolved to request the bureau to instruct the chief technicians of the Raw Silk Inspection Office to be responsible for explaining the actual reasons for the losses and to discuss how to improve the situation, so as to convene a general meeting for reporting on a regular basis. Please investigate and implement this matter. Respectfully yours."</p>
<h3>Ham Industry Association Cables Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>Requesting the Cancellation of Construction Donations in Six Counties of Jinhua</p>
<p>The ham industry association of this city, due to the sudden imposition of ham donation taxes by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance starting from June 1st, had submitted a request to the city chamber of commerce to forward a cable to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting the cancellation of the increased donation. Recently, it was suddenly heard that the producing areas of the six counties of Jinhua also intend to collect local construction fees from October 1st, donating five cents of silver per ham. The industry believes that this donation tax is heavy and that the people and businesses cannot bear it. Yesterday, they specially sent a telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting a clear order to cancel it first. The original telegram states: "Respectfully to Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Your Excellency, the ham donation tax in your province, since it was announced and implemented on June 1st of this year, our association submitted a request to the city chamber of commerce to forward a cable to Your Excellency, requesting exemption from the increased donation. We received a reply stating that ham is a semi-luxury item, etc. Upon investigation, ham is essentially a common preserved food, made by simply adding salt. It can be stored for a long time. It is not comparable to items such as ginseng, swallow's nest, and white fungus, which can be called luxury items. This is known to everyone. Our association was preparing to make a second appeal. Unexpectedly, during this period, we heard that the ham-producing areas of Jinhua, Lanxi, Yiwu, Dongyang, Yongkang, Wuyi, and Pujiang, six counties, also intend to collect five cents of silver per ham for the construction of each county. In this situation, how can the people bear it? Moreover, the multiple layers of donation taxes will make business operations difficult and will invisibly reduce sales in the future. It will also lead to a reduction in production by farmers. Both directly and indirectly, they will be greatly affected. At a time when China is in a backward state of production, how should the government protect this domestic product? Now, not only is there no such plan, but it is being destroyed. We are deeply worried about future disasters. Therefore, we are compelled to send a telegram to appeal, earnestly requesting Your Excellency to consider the difficulties of the people's livelihood and promptly issue an order to cancel the construction donation taxes proposed to be collected in the six counties, in order to alleviate business difficulties. This is the public sentiment. Shanghai Ham Industry Association Preparatory Office bows respectfully."</p>
<h3>The Ministry Appoints Li Yaobang</h3>
<p>To Serve as Technician at the Raw Silk Inspection Office</p>
<p>Specializing in Physical Research on Raw Silk</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau's Raw Silk Inspection Office previously submitted a request to appoint Sun Benzhong to be in charge of chemical research. After searching for a suitable candidate for physical research, they submitted a request to the Ministry to appoint Dr. Li Yaobang as a technician to be fully responsible for this work and actively carry it out. This has now been approved. The bureau has sent a letter to Dr. Li, inviting him to take office on September 1st. Mr. Li holds a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Chicago and a PhD in Physics. He has served as a professor of physics at the University of Chicago and Southeast University, a special commissioner of the National Chamber of Commerce to the European and American Industrial Arts Investigation Committee, and Deputy Director-General of the National Youth Association. He has profound knowledge and rich experience and is a rare talent in our country.</p>
<h3>Western Newspaper Reports on Chongqing Fire</h3>
<p>Losses of 1.5 Million Taels</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that Chongqing recently suffered a major fire that destroyed 3,000 houses, with losses estimated at 1.5 million taels of silver. After the fire, the city was in a state of great disturbance. The authorities have declared martial law. This is the third major fire in recent years. The first was in the spring of 1928, with losses of 500,000 taels of silver. Another fire occurred a year later. The most recent one seems even more severe than the previous two. The heavy losses are due to the lack of water sources on the mountains and the lack of modern fire-fighting equipment. The fire started at around 11:00 am on Monday and was extinguished at 6:00 pm. The fire originated near the riverside city gate, within the moat area, which is the essence of the commercial district. Large shops stood side by side, and the post office was also nearby. After the fire broke out, flames quickly soared and were unapproachable. It also burned the shacks and wooden docks along the river. The wind fueled the fire, and it spread quickly. It then crossed the city walls and extended to the foothills. For a time, the fire obscured the sky, and the sound of people was deafening. The streets were crowded with refugees, calling for mothers and daughters, and moving miscellaneous items. This continued for seven hours, destroying 3,000 houses, before it was brought under control. Most of the residents of these 3,000 houses barely escaped with their lives. Everything in their homes was reduced to ashes. A freighter belonging to Nippon Yusen Kaisha and a barge moored beside it, carrying goods worth 5,000 yuan, were burned before they could be towed across the river. It is heard that almost all foreign businesses operating in Chongqing were affected, but the extent of the losses is unknown. The losses from this fire are estimated to be around 1.5 million taels of silver. Martial law was immediately declared and military police were dispatched to protect the fire area in order to prevent looters from taking advantage of the disaster and to maintain order.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association</h3>

<h3>Sixty Wounded Soldiers Sent to Jin County Government for Detention</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters yesterday afternoon ordered soldiers to escort a total of sixty wounded soldiers involved in the incident in cargo trucks, and sent them in three batches to the Shanghai County Government for detention. After unloading, the soldiers returned immediately. The county government ordered the Public Security Bureau to provide temporary protection. In the afternoon, Director Shen Jinghua of the Public Security Bureau went to the Longhua Garrison Department to request the allocation of soldiers to the county on a rotation basis for protection and deterrence.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Emphasizes Hygiene</h3>
<p>In order to emphasize hygiene and facilitate passengers, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway has specially set up a number of attendants on each passenger train to handle cleaning matters on the train. These attendants were originally managed by the railway's chief hygiene inspector. Recently, the railway bureau, considering the limited number of staff in the hygiene department, which may lead to inadequate inspections, has notified all staff on the railway to jointly supervise and emphasize hygiene.</p>
<h3>Water Supply Problem in Fu'an Lane, Zhabei</h3>
<p>Fu'an Lane on Chang'an Road in Zhabei had previously been connected to tap water, but the water supply was cut off due to a rent increase issue. The tenants were willing to draw river water rather than increase their burden. Later, the landlord planned to moderately increase the rent and restore the water supply, but the tenants still refused and demanded a rent reduction. A tenant recently sent a letter to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, stating that the lack of drinking water was detrimental to hygiene and requesting relief. The bureau summoned representatives of the landlord and the rental accountant to inquire about the situation. The landlord and tenants had previously agreed that the landlord could not be held responsible for the water supply if the rent was reduced and the tenants drew river water. However, for the sake of careful consideration of the people's drinking water, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company was ordered to set up a public tap in the lane to sell drinking water. Unexpectedly, the company sent staff twice to contact the residents in the lane and ask them to recommend a person in charge of managing the water tap, but they were unable to find anyone. The bureau reported this and had to notify the landlord that if the residents of the lane subsequently requested water from the landlord, they could be directed to contact the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company for handling.</p>
<h3>Meat Merchants in Various Villages in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Oppose Collective Slaughter</p>
<p>The meat merchants of various towns in western Shanghai, such as Shen Santai of Hongqiao Town, Jin Chang of Huacao Town, Xie Shun of Wangmanshui Bridge, and Shi Yushun, etc., recently received a letter from the Puson District Municipal Affairs Committee Office, stating that according to the instructions of the Health Bureau, all meat merchants in various towns in the district must go to the Puson District Public Slaughterhouse for inspection before selling their meat, starting from September 1st. Otherwise, the relevant Public Security Bureau will strictly ban and punish them according to law. Upon hearing this, the meat merchants panicked and jointly submitted a request to the Health Bureau and the Municipal Affairs Committee to find a way to alleviate their difficulties. They also listed facts to unanimously oppose the order: (1) The various towns are more than ten miles away from Puson Town and are all rural roads, making travel inconvenient, unlike other places; (2) Jiangqiao and Zhuzhai are both under the jurisdiction of the Puson District, and the meat merchants in the two towns have not been subjected to the same inspection; (3) The Meilong Town and Changqiao Town in the Caojing District have inconvenient transportation and are being handled gradually. Therefore, the three towns in our area should also be included in the gradual handling.</p>

<p>Silk Factory Industry The Silk Factory Association held its ninth committee meeting at 3 pm the day before yesterday. Twelve people, including Huang Jinfan, Wang Xiaolai, and Wu Shenbo, attended. Chairman Shen Yechen proposed that the Export Silk Association had sent a letter regarding their opinion on the import of Japanese cocoons to China, and asked for discussion. It was generally agreed that cocoon production in various places this year was scarce, and silk raw materials might be exhausted after autumn. During this time of sluggish silk market, the industry could choose to not focus so much on this, however the jobs of tens of thousands of workers are at stake. It had previously been heard in June that there was a bumper harvest of Japanese cocoons at low prices. The Chinese government did not prohibit their import. Being able to reduce taxes and purchase Japanese cocoons could subsidize raw materials and maintain factory operations, and could also protect the livelihoods of workers. They had previously sent a letter to Chairman Huang Jinshan of the Jiang, Zhe, and Wan Silk Cocoon General Association. This was an expedient measure to remedy the cocoon shortage and maintain the livelihoods of workers. Although there have been many rumors about the import of Japanese cocoons to China recently, in reality, there is no reliable news that Japanese cocoons are actually being imported. It was resolved to first reply to the Export Silk Association, in order to prevent over-speculation. Next, the case of export factory silk, inspection, public quantity, and the suffering of losses was discussed. The Commodity Inspection Bureau was requested to be responsible for the explanation. Finally, the case of increasing wages for female workers was discussed. It was resolved to convene a general meeting to seek public opinion and then verify it. The meeting adjourned after the discussion at more than 7 pm.</p>

<h3>Seven Key Points for Those with Lung Disease to Know</h3>
<p>Narrated by Dr. Ishigami Toru, a Famous Japanese Lung Disease Physician</p>
<p>(First) If appropriate treatment is given for lung disease in its early stages, even severe illnesses can be cured and good health can be maintained permanently. However, since ancient times, many people have believed that lung disease is incurable. Doctors, when consulting, often throw up their hands and sigh, considering it hopeless. Patients also lose their will and spirit because of this, yet they are unwilling to wait for death. They suspect that their doctor has misdiagnosed them and have no choice but to seek help from another doctor. If the second doctor has no solutions, they may even go to a third or fourth, wandering around aimlessly, not knowing where to turn. Eventually, they entrust themselves to a doctor who does not diagnose lung disease. The treatment is half-doubtful and half-believing, and the medicine is neither here nor there. Time flows by, and there is no effect at all. Having no other choice, they seek out strange medicines and remedies, or acupuncture and incantations, but the illness ultimately leads to death. Alas, what can be done? Moreover, since the doctor does not diagnose lung disease, the patient pays no attention to prevention and disinfection. Their illness worsens day by day, and their poison spreads to relatives and friends endlessly. The flooding of a river, without dikes and defenses, is bound to flow endlessly, breaking through for thousands of miles. It is truly regrettable. Therefore, if the false belief that lung disease is incurable has such drawbacks, how should patients seek early medical treatment and firmly believe that it is curable, in order to ensure their own happiness? How about that of others?</p>
<p>Now, let us take a few examples of patients whose illnesses have worsened due to their doubts and delayed treatment.</p>
<p>Since the lifting of Japan's closed-door policy, Western civilization has gradually been imported, and medical scientists have made daily progress. However, there is no special medicine for lung disease. Whether it is a doctor licensed by the government or a well-known expert, they are generally helpless and have no long-term solutions. Patients have no choice but to consult old-style doctors. Old-style doctors mainly use old methods. When lung disease first develops, they forbid all nourishing foods. They also take disinfection of sputum lightly. This not only increases the patient's suffering but also hinders public health. Can one not feel chilled? Han medical books, no matter when they were written, all consider lung disease difficult to treat. There is no need to discuss other things, but as for tuberculosis being lung disease, the term "tuberculosis" means being sacrificed after death.</p>
<p>(Medical saying) The fact that this word is used in the name of the disease shows that Han doctors have no way to cure lung disease.</p>
<p>Also, old medical books have a category of "tuberculosis worms." (Ten Medicine Spiritual Book) is certainly absurd, and knowledgeable people despise it. However, the old customs of the people regarded tubercle bacillus as lung disease worms, almost equating them with tuberculosis worms. The account of tuberculosis worms in the book by Yuan Nanyang (Small Talk on Medical Matters) provides enough material for ridicule. His saying that is enough to deceive people is that tuberculosis worms grow in the stomach and can gradually eat away the flesh between the ribs. The nature of the worms is extremely intelligent, and one must secretly make bezoar pills to kill them. The worms cannot escape, and the effect is miraculous. If the patient knows about the combination of medicines beforehand, it will not be effective, he said.</p>
<p>He also calls his cauterization method as follows: the four flowers on the patient's door (the name of the cauterization) together are called six flowers, all used to cauterize tuberculosis. There are sixteen holes in the human spine, and when the disease occurs, cauterization is performed from here. There are various miraculous methods for treating tuberculosis, but none have had great results. The four-flower cauterization has been praised as miraculous in ancient and modern times. Although I often use it, it does not cure true tuberculosis, only gas addiction (gas addiction is nervous disorder). Also, old medical books contain many miraculous medicines for lung disease, such as skullcaps, otter livers, geckos, human bile, human oil, heavenly stones, and bezoar. These are not worth discussing. Those with shallow knowledge among the old doctors also consider these rare things. People are curious and value things that are rare, so they cherish them like phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Even if they obtain them, they may not be effective. In Japan today, the knowledge of the people is not yet enlightened, and they often regret not being able to try these medicines, thus endangering their lives. I do not know how many there are. How pitiful!</p>
<p>(Second) Those with lung disease must receive an early diagnosis from a doctor. As mentioned earlier, if appropriate methods are applied at the beginning, the patient will not have to groan in bed, and germs can be killed at any time, preventing infection. Even if infection has occurred and the poison has spread to a shallow level, it is still easy to cure. (Third) Lung disease is definitely an infectious disease, and sputum should not be scattered randomly. Patients rarely pay attention to this. They spit everywhere without disinfecting immediately, thus infecting their wives and children. Gradually, it spreads to the entire family, and they are cut off from food. Such tragedies are common. In recent years, the number of people suffering from lung disease has increased, and fellow countrymen have lost the joy of longevity, and the country has reduced its productive capacity. This is due to the spread of the virus. Therefore, patients should all have a loving heart and a sense of public morality. Whether inside or outside the home, they must be careful to prevent it.</p>
<p>(Fourth) The sputum of those with lung disease should be coughed up and not swallowed again. If it is swallowed by mistake, the sputum poison will be transmitted to the intestines and develop into intestinal tuberculosis. Children and young people often do not understand the principle of poison transmission. Moreover, girls often feel ashamed to cough up sputum in front of others when they reach adulthood and swallow it instead. Intestinal tuberculosis develops as a result. Even if their lung disease is mild, diarrhea and indigestion are enough to weaken their bodies. Is treatment not more difficult? Therefore, parents of young people should be warned against this.</p>
<p>(Fifth) A nourishing diet should not be lacking. When old-style doctors diagnose illnesses, they often forbid people from eating any food. All meals should be light rather than rich, and little rather than much. They adhere to the old methods and are unbreakable. Or they casually cauterize, knowing a little about medical skills, and wrongly harm themselves and others. They say that patients should eat nothing but white porridge with salted plums, and all other foods should be avoided. This is another great absurdity.</p>
<p>(Sixth) Be careful with alcohol and sexual activity. Everyone knows that drinking too much alcohol is harmful to life. It is unnecessary to elaborate on the harm of sexual activity to lung disease. Unmarried men and women should postpone their marriage. Married couples should live separately.</p>
<p>(Seventh) Places with dust should be avoided. Places such as theaters and night markets, where crowds gather, have unclean air and should not be entered. When walking, choose a clear and open area outside the city. Even if you occasionally go to a market, be careful.</p>

<h3>New Chemical Treatment for Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>Pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., consumption) is caused by the tubercle bacillus. Once this bacterium enters the human body, it forms nodules at that location, obstructing blood circulation. Furthermore, the tubercle bacillus can secrete an acid-fast waxy substance that surrounds its body, preventing the intrusion of all external medicinal forces. Therefore, despite the use of various bactericidal drugs, whether taken internally or injected, they ultimately cannot reach the actual substance of the pathogen. The natural therapies, symptomatic treatments, physical therapies, serum therapies, drug therapies, and all other treatments that physicians have traditionally used have not been entirely successful. The saying that there is no cure for lung disease has spread throughout the world because people did not understand this profound scientific principle. As a result, modern tuberculosis scholars, based on the aforementioned scientific principles, continue their research without sparing any effort. Eventually, they have succeeded in creating a chemical panacea that kills all tubercle bacilli, called Sanosin. This drug was invented following the latest medical theories of Dr. Koch of Germany, the discoverer of the tubercle bacillus, and Dr. Barger of Germany, the inventor of the tubercle bacillus dewaxing technique. According to experimental reports from various pulmonary sanatoriums in Germany, Switzerland, and other countries, this drug has the effect of penetrating the nodules of pulmonary tuberculosis and dissolving the waxy substance. It also has bactericidal power and can radically cure stage one, two, and three pulmonary tuberculosis. It has a truly effective effect that has been proven effective in all tests. In China, the drug has been chemically tested by the Central Hygiene Laboratory of the National Government, and it is mild and non-toxic, with absolutely no side effects.</p>
<p>The therapeutic effects are briefly listed below:</p>
<p>(1) When the medicinal power of "Sanosin" is tested in a test tube, the acid-fastness of the tubercle bacilli disappears after one minute. After three minutes, the tubercle bacilli are completely killed, with none spared.</p>
<p>(2) According to animal experiments, "Sanosin" can penetrate into tuberculous lesions. An examination of the tubercle bacilli latent within the lesions reveals that they have completely lost their acid-fastness. This is sufficient proof that the waxy substance has been completely dissolved.</p>
<p>(3) If patients take "Sanosin" internally for about a week, they will immediately see a good condition such as thinning of phlegm and a decrease in body temperature.</p>
<p>(4) Continued internal use of "Sanosin" for 30 to 60 days or more will clearly show an increase in body weight and a sharp increase in appetite. All symptoms gradually subside, eventually achieving the great effect of restoration to health.</p>

<h3>Advantageous to Bank Staff</h3>
<p>Shan Xinsheng Kidnapped Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Kidnappers Pre-rented a Car</p>
<p>Driver Forced Out Mid-way</p>
<p>Shan Xinsheng Falls into the Hands of Bandits</p>
<p>Car Found in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Shan Xinsheng, a runner in the compradore's office of the Banque Franco-Chinoise on the Bund No. 26, was kidnapped by bandits on Sinza Road at around 8:40 yesterday morning. The car used by the bandits was rented from the Futai Motor Company on Mintung Road, outside the Small East Gate. The driver was forced out of the car mid-way, and then the car was driven to Sinza Road to kidnap Shan Xinsheng. The car was found at 3:10 p.m. yesterday in a wasteland behind the Mint Factory on Chungshan Road. However, the whereabouts of the hostage are still unknown.</p>
<h3>A Man and a Woman Rent a Car. 21 Mintung Road</h3>
<p>At around 7:20 yesterday morning, a man and a woman came to the Futai Motor Company at 21 Mintung Road to rent a car. The man was around 40 years old, wearing a Sun Yat-sen suit, and speaking with a Ningpo accent. The woman was about 20 years old, wearing a reddish-brown cheongsam. The man claimed to be named Wang Zhilan, wanting to rent a car to be driven to Great China University on Kiaochow Road and then back. The cashier ordered the driver, Chen Yu-kuei, to drive car No. 4141 (Concession No. 12545) to serve the customer and drove directly to Kiaochow Road.</p>
<h3>Three Men Waiting on Chungshan Road. The Car Arrives</h3>
<p>When the car arrived at its destination on Kiaochow Road, the passenger in the car suddenly ordered the car to be taken to the new campus of Great China University on Chungshan Road. The driver complied and drove west. When the car reached a field on Chungshan Road in Chapei, three men were ambushed by the roadside. Two men were wearing white clothes, and one was wearing a black robe. After the car stopped, they immediately drew handguns, frightening driver Chen Yu-kuei and forbidding him from yelling. They dragged him out of the car, and two men in white shirts guarded him. The car was driven away by the man in the black shirt. About an hour and a half later, the two men released the driver.</p>
<h3>Shan Xinsheng Kidnapped After Car Robbery. The Bandits Rob</h3>
<p>After the bandits robbed the No. 4141 car, they drove it to Sinza Road and stopped near No. 72, in front of the Chingliang Temple. At around 8:30, Shan Xinsheng, who lived at No. 91 Nanan Lane, was traveling east from his home in a rickshaw. When he reached the car, suddenly four or five men stepped forward, holding weapons, dragged Shan out of the rickshaw, forced him into the car, and then sped west. The kidnapped Shan Xinsheng is 30 years old, from Shaohing, and works as a runner in the compradore's office of the Banque Franco-Chinoise. His monthly income is not very high, and he has only worked at the bank for just over two months. Before that, he worked as a clerk at the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Shan's family is very poor, and his position at the bank is very low, so it is very difficult to raise funds. This kidnapping may have been a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3>Report to the Police for Arrest, Car Found. Shan Xinsheng</h3>
<p>Every morning, Shan went to work by rickshaw. The rickshaw puller had been pulling Shan every morning for many days, so they were very familiar with each other. After the incident, he reported it to Shan's family. However, Shan's family did not immediately report it to the police. Two or three hours later, the Jing'an Temple police station made this news public. On the one hand, the driver Chen Yu-kuei of the Futai Motor Company also returned to the company to report the car robbery and informed the Public Security Bureau and the police to investigate. It was not until about 3:10 p.m. that the car was found behind the Mint Factory on Chungshan Road in Chapei.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Rice Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Minhang New Rice Sells for Sixteen Yuan</p>
<p>Future Prices Expected to Fall Step by Step</p>
<p>Since early summer, the source of rice in Shanghai has been lacking, and the market price has risen sharply. At its highest, high-quality white rice rose to a huge 22 or 23 yuan, and there was a price but no market. People were panic-stricken, and ordinary people were worried. Fortunately, the Bureau of Social Affairs came forward to maintain and suppress rice prices. On the one hand, it ordered rice industry groups to suppress rice prices and not raise them. On the other hand, the rice industry stated that the reason why rice prices were so high and there were shortages of goods was due to the disasters in various producing areas last year. Therefore, they sent letters to Pudong, Minhang, and Ye Xie, where the new rice comes out earliest, to inquire about the situation of this year's fields. It happened that the new rice from Zhoupu, Pudong, which was the earliest to be harvested and put on the market, was shipped to Shanghai in an endless stream. It is said that the harvest in Pudong this year is very abundant, and people's minds are settled, and the market is also stable. New rice from Zhoupu, Pudong, opened at 21 yuan. Unexpectedly, in the middle of this month, the new rice from Minhang in western Shanghai and Ye Xie in Songjiang also harvested and went on the market one after another. The initial price opened at 19 yuan and 50 cents, but the source gradually became prosperous, and sales were very scarce. Rice shops that purchased goods were also waiting and watching. It is heard that Minhang's harvest this year is abundant and the goods are even better, with a harvest of 120%. Recently, the owners, seeing the market declining, have entrusted brokers to sell quickly to avoid losses. Yesterday, Minhang new rice opened at 16 yuan, which was 3 yuan and several corners less than the previous week. Ye Xie new rice was 16 yuan, 2 corners, and 3 cents, while Zhoupu new rice was the best and also fell to 16 yuan, 6 corners, and 7 cents, which was more than 4 yuan less than when it first arrived. It is said that the time for new rice to be on the market this year is not long, and its price has fallen very quickly, which is also rare. This is because the harvests in various places are quite good and the harvests are abundant. Judging from this situation, the harvest in the major producing areas of Jiangsu, Songjiang, Changzhou, and Wuxi this year will not be reduced. According to letters from Jiangsu and Songjiang, the time for harvesting is probably around the Double Ninth Festival, and it may be possible to see new rice. However, the new Xian rice from Jianghuai has also been arriving in large quantities recently, with thousands of shipments arriving every day. Yesterday, the top-quality new Xian rice opened at 13 yuan, 3 corners, and 4 cents, and sales were not high. The market outlook is sluggish. Therefore, the price of Japonica rice has also declined slightly. In the future, after the new rice from the major producing areas of Jiangsu, Songjiang, Changzhou, and Wuxi goes on the market, the price of rice in Shanghai may fall step by step.</p>
<h3>Chang Kuei-san</h3>
<p>Accused of Posing as a Lawyer</p>
<p>Defendant Claims to be Chang Tso-tang</p>
<p>Chang Kuei-san is a Lawyer from Hangchow</p>
<p>Sued for Debt and then Withdrew</p>
<p>Yesterday's Trial Ordered Detention</p>
<p>Chang Kuei-san, a native of Ningpo, 42 years old, residing at No. 600, North Shanxi Road, has recently been posing as a lawyer, defrauding people and causing them to lose their assets. The Shanghai Lawyers Association learned of this and believed that if it was not strictly investigated, it would not only damage the reputation of the Lawyers Association, but also cause endless trouble. Therefore, it sent a letter to the Procuratorate of the Special District Court, requesting prosecution according to law. Chief Prosecutor Chou Hsien-chueh referred the case to the Shanghai Municipal Police for investigation. After investigation by Lawyer Ju Pao-i of the Legal Group of the Municipal Police, it was confirmed that Chang Kuei-san had indeed committed the act of defrauding money unsuccessfully. Therefore, a public prosecution was filed with the court. The facts of Chang Kuei-san's crime and the reasons for the prosecution are excerpted below. (Facts) There is a Chang Kuei-san, who is not known to have any legal qualifications, has not joined the Shanghai Lawyers Association, and has no fixed address or office. On April 7, 8, 15, and 17 of the 19th year of the Republic of China, he used the name of a lawyer to represent the Yuan Shun Seafood Store, using letterheads and stationery of the Chang Kuei-san Law Office and Lawyer Chang Kuei-san, to demand a debt of 370 taels of silver from the Kung Chang Embroidery Shop at No. 1259, Chungteh Lane, Peking Road, Shanghai. The Kung Chang Embroidery Shop believed that this money was unfounded and ignored it. Chang Kuei-san then filed a civil lawsuit in the Shanghai Special District Court in the name of the legal representative Chang Tso-tang. The Civil Court issued Payment Order No. 3. The Kung Chang Embroidery Shop immediately filed an objection. Before the case was opened for trial, the summons for the plaintiff Yuan Shun Seafood Store was rejected. The shop assistant Chang stated that he had not engaged in any litigation matters. On June 16, at the first hearing, someone claiming to be a representative of Chang Tso-tang appeared in court to answer questions. The judge presiding over the case, because he did not have a formal power of attorney to prove his authority as a representative, adjourned the case to July 5 for continued hearing. At that time, the person who had appeared in court as a representative of Chang Tso-tang appeared in court again and claimed to be Chang Tso-tang himself. The defendant's lawyer from Kung Chang Embroidery Shop, Hsu Tsu-yen, asked him whether he was the lawyer Chang Kuei-san who had written the letter beforehand. He admitted it in court without hesitation. The court hearing was recorded in the original trial transcript. The case was later dismissed by Chang Kuei-san because the case was false. (Reasons) Based on the above facts, the question of whether Chang Kuei-san has legal qualifications is not investigated for the time being. However, the fact that he cannot practice law in Shanghai has been proven by the Shanghai Lawyers Association. Judging from the words of the shop assistant Chang of the Yuan Shun Seafood Store, who is named as the plaintiff, and the fact that the civil court summons was rejected, the question of whether Chang Kuei-san had been entrusted or requested by the Yuan Shun Seafood Store beforehand became a major question. Moreover, when he first wrote to the Kung Chang Embroidery Shop, he used the name of Lawyer Chang Kuei-san. When he applied for the payment order, he used the name of legal representative Chang Tso-tang. At the first hearing, he appeared in court as the representative of Chang Tso-tang. At the second continued hearing, he appeared in court in the name of Chang Tso-tang himself. Finally, because his plan failed, he withdrew the lawsuit. The trickery of a demon is becoming increasingly apparent. The more he tries to cover up his guilt, the more he reveals it. Moreover, this kind of behavior cannot be done without considerable knowledge and a person who is experienced in this way. Therefore, the defendant in this case has committed a crime under Article 363, Section 3 of the Criminal Code. Please pay attention to the judgment, etc. Yesterday morning, Judge Chou Han-ting opened the court for trial. Prosecutor Hsu Mei also attended the court to perform his duties. First, Lawyer Ju stated the reasons for the prosecution. Then, he presented the four letters received by Kung Chang and the payment orders issued by the court as evidence, requesting inspection. Judge Chou then questioned the defendant Chang Kuei-san. Chang Kuei-san confessed, "I have heard everything the police lawyer said. But I am actually named Chang Tso-tang, not Chang Kuei-san. I used to be an assistant in Lawyer Feng Chan's office. Chang Kuei-san is a lawyer in Hangchow, but he has a correspondence address in my office. He and I have a contract that can be used as proof. Because a friend, Chen Ming-yu, introduced the case of Yuan Shun Seafood Store to me, I wrote a letter to the Kung Chang Embroidery Shop in the name of Lawyer Chang Kuei-san to demand the debt. However, Kung Chang ignored it. I then filed a lawsuit in the name of a representative, but I did not use the words 'legal representative.'" Lawyer Ju immediately stood up and declared, "The payment order issued by the court has the words 'legal representative Chang Tso-tang' written on it. If the defendant had not used the words 'legal representative,' then the court would not have added them arbitrarily. How can the defendant quibble about this?" Judge Chou instructed the defendant, "You say that Chang Kuei-san is practicing law in Hangchow. Therefore, he has not registered in Shanghai. It is also illegal for an unregistered lawyer to represent litigation." The defendant confessed that this matter was entirely entrusted by a friend, so he handled it, and it was an obligation. Therefore, he used the name of Lawyer Chang Kuei-san to avoid all costs, etc. Then, Chiang Lian-fang, the manager of Yuan Shun, was summoned, but Chiang did not arrive. Chen Ming-yu appeared in court as a representative. After questioning, Judge Chou learned that Chen had not obtained Chiang's authorization and could not be recognized as Chiang's representative. He could only be recognized as a witness in the case. He was questioned and confessed that he was a native of Ningpo and now works at the Feng Customs Brokerage. The former Yuan Chang Store paid a promissory note of 1,370 taels of silver to Qi Tung-sheng. The date for the payment was November 24 of last year. Later, Qi returned to his hometown due to an accident, so he entrusted me with the promissory note to discount it at Yuan Shun Store. When it came due, the bank that Yuan Shun used to cash the check refused to pay because the issuer did not have enough money. Chiang Lian-fang, the manager of Yuan Shun, demanded payment from me. I was unable to pay. Seeing that he was suing, Chiang proceeded with the lawsuit, etc. However, Wei Hsin, a partner in the Yuan Chang Embroidery Shop, denied that the check was issued by Yuan Chang, etc. Lawyer Ju then interrogated Chen and Yu one by one. The police will file another lawsuit against Chen for perjury and requested that the defendant be detained or released on bail. Judge Chou asked Chang Kuei-san if he had bail. Chang said no. Therefore, he ordered detention and adjourned the hearing to another day. Unexpectedly, when Chang heard that he would be detained, he claimed that he had bail and requested that the detention be stopped. The police lawyer opposed this, saying that the case had been adjudicated and should be bound by it. Judge Chou also did not approve the request and ordered the police to take Chang to detention. As for Chen Ming-yu, he was ordered to pay bail to be available for questioning at any time.</p>
<h3>Tax Bureau Director Tang Hui-hsuan</h3>
<p>Accuses Wife of Adultery</p>
<p>Married and Had Children in the United States</p>
<p>Tang Says Wife Has Been Acting Strange Lately</p>
<p>Both Parties File Lawsuits Against Each Other</p>
<p>Chen Ken-wei Denies Everything</p>
<p>Tang Hui-hsuan (also known as Tang Chung-tz'u, also known as Shih-an), the former Director of the Stamp Tax Bureau in Yichang, Hupeh (a native of Kweilin, Kwangsi), is now 36 years old. In the 12th year of the Republic of China, he was introduced to marry Tsou Ai-chen, the daughter of Tsou Yu-shih, a woman from Shanghai. They were married in the United States. In the 15th year of the Republic of China, Tsou returned to China first and lived with her mother, Tsou Yu-shih (now residing at No. 821, Chunghua Road, Tananmen, in this city). Tang returned to China in the 16th year of the Republic of China and soon went to work in other ports. This time, Tang returned to China on the 10th of this month. When he arrived at his wife's family, he found that his wife Tsou Ai-chen had a different attitude and learned that Tsou and Chen Ken-wei had improper behavior. Therefore, on the morning of the 16th of this month, he summoned the police from the same post to catch the adulterers in the house at No. 821. Chen Ken-wei and Tsou Ai-chen were taken to the Third Section of the First District Police Station for interrogation and ordered to be released on bail pending further instructions. Tang Hui-hsuan was still unwilling and hired Lawyers Yuan Yang-an and Shih Ying to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the District Court. The complaint stated that the defendants Tsou Ai-chen and Chen Ken-wei had committed adultery and requested strict punishment according to law. The plaintiff and Tsou were married in the United States in the past and had a son and a daughter.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Returned to China in the 16th year of the Republic of China and lived with his wife's mother. Two more sons were born (both sons born in 224 have died). Later, he went elsewhere due to an accident. Ai-chen still lived in her mother's house. Now that the plaintiff has returned to Shanghai, he sees that Ai-chen has suddenly changed and treats the plaintiff like an enemy. After the plaintiff learned that Ai-chen and Chen Ken-wei were having an affair, the plaintiff could not bear it and moved elsewhere. On the morning of the 16th of this month, he went to investigate alone. Unexpectedly, the defendants were still dreaming. He immediately summoned the police and went straight to Ai-chen's room, where he caught the adulterer and adulteress on the bed and handed them over to the Third Section of the First District Police Station of the Public Security Bureau for the record. Therefore, a private prosecution is filed, requesting strict punishment to maintain morality and discipline, etc. The defendant Tsou Ai-chen hired Lawyer Chiang I-ping to file a defense. On the one hand, she also told the Procuratorate of the Court that Tang Hui-hsuan had committed bigamy and slander, etc. Chen Ken-wei also hired Lawyer Yan Yin-wu to defend himself and told the Criminal Court that Tang Hui-hsuan had committed slander and injury, etc. At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, Judge Wu Chen specially opened the First Court to hear the case of Tang Hui-hsuan accusing him of obstructing the family. After the judge took the seat, he first heard the plaintiff Tang Hui-hsuan, 36 years old, a native of Kwangsi, and stated the previous situation, requesting strict punishment. Next, he heard the defendant Tsou Ai-chen, 26 years old, a native of Shanghai, living with her mother at No. 821, Chunghua Road. (Question) When did you get married? (Answer) In the 12th year of the Republic of China, we were married in the United States. We have two children now. (Question) When did you return to China? (Answer) In the 15th year, I returned to China first. My husband returned to China in the following year (i.e., the 16th year) in December. In the following year (17th year) in January, he went to Nanking to seek employment with Li Tsung-jen. After he (referring to the plaintiff) left, about two weeks later, he sent a letter to Shanghai, instructing me to go there. Before long, he obtained the position of Deputy Director of the Special Tax Bureau of Kerosene in Hankow. I also went to Hankow with him. When Li failed, he resigned and came back. (Question) Do you know Chen Ken-wei? (Answer) Yes, we are childhood friends. He is my mother's adopted son. His mother and my mother are sworn sisters in incense burning. (Question) What is your relationship with Chen Ken-wei? (Answer) Just a brother-sister relationship. (Question) Did you quarrel with the plaintiff on the 10th of this month? (Answer) No, we did not quarrel. (Question) Where does the plaintiff live? (Answer) In the pavilion. Because he has poison, we do not share the same bed. His name is Chung-tz'u. This time, he used the name Tang Hui-hsuan to destroy my reputation intentionally. He once said to me that he would divorce me privately. I replied that I am a proper formal husband and wife, not a concubine, and can be casual. If it is necessary to divorce, it should be done through official procedures. (Question) Was the plaintiff at home on the 11th of this month? (Answer) Yes, he was at home. He moved out on the 12th. (Question) Did he come to your house again on the 16th? (Answer) At about 5:00 a.m. on the 16th, four people came to my house, one in uniform with a gun, and three in casual clothes. (Question) Were you up at that time? (Answer) I was not up. My younger sister and two children were sleeping in the front building of the living room. (Question) Does Chen Ken-wei live in your house? (Answer) Chen Ken-wei lives in the back building of my house if he does not go out. Moreover, when they went upstairs, my outer clothes were not on, but my shirt was still neat. My younger sister (Yueh-chen) and the children can prove it, etc. The judge ordered Chen Ken-wei to come to the case to testify. He is 28 years old and a local. (Question) What is your relationship with the Tsou family? (Answer) Adoptive mother. (Question) When did you start living in his house? (Answer) I started living in his house in February of the year before last. When I was 12 years old, my mother and adoptive mother met in the temple and burned incense. (Question) Do you have a wife? (Answer) My wife has been dead for four years. (Question) Do you know Tang Hui-hsuan? (Answer) Yes, I know him. (Question) Where do you live? (Answer) I live in the back building of the living room. (Question) Where did you live on the 16th of this month? (Answer) The back building. (Question) Did you get up when the police came on the morning of the 16th? (Answer) I had not gotten up yet. They caught me. I do not know why. At that time, Ai-chen, etc., were all in the front building. At this point, Tang Hui-hsuan interjected, "Their words are not right. Check that the defendant Tsou Ai-chen's mother and sister are all living in the pavilion. Tsou Ai-chen lives in the front building. All the furniture and beds in the room were purchased by me, etc." Lawyer Chiang rose up and said, "When the plaintiff was the Director of the Stamp Tax Bureau in Yichang, he forged stamp taxes. When the case was exposed, Tang absconded. This can prove Tang's personality." The judge said, "This matter is not within the scope of this case." Tsou Ai-chen interjected, "The plaintiff's doctorate was bought with money." At this point, the lawyers hired by the plaintiff and the defendant each made statements. The questioning officer ordered a postponement of the hearing for further testimony. The plaintiff's lawyer requested that the two defendants be detained. The defendant's lawyer rose to object. As a result, the questioning officer ordered the plaintiff and the defendant to leave together and wait for instructions.</p>
<h3>Daughter of a Tailor</h3>
<p>A Page of an Affair</p>
<p>Knowing No Shame</p>
<p>Zhou Laifa from Ningbo, nearing forty, works as a tailor. His wife, Zhou Yuan, is of similar age. They reside at No. 2, Sanyuan Lane, Wangjia Residence, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. Their eldest daughter, Zhou Fengxian, also known as Zhou Fengxian, is only sixteen years old and quite petite, resembling a child. Recently, she has been working at a cigarette factory near the Garbage Bridge. It so happened that Lu Xiangzhou, a twenty-two-year-old man from Pudong who used to be a waiter at a restaurant there, often seduced Fengxian. As a result, Fengxian fell in love with him. However, the young girl did not understand what love was, only knowing pleasure. She often lied to her parents about working night shifts to engage in shameless acts with her lover. After some time, Zhou Yuan became suspicious. On the 18th of this month, Fengxian claimed she had a night shift again and did not return home. Zhou Yuan went to inquire and found that there was no night shift. Fengxian did not return that night and only came home at ten o'clock the next morning. The mother then pressed her daughter about any improper behavior. The daughter initially denied it, but the mother consoled her, saying, "Know that your parents are not stubborn. If there is someone you truly care for, your mother will help you achieve your wish, especially since you are not yet betrothed." Fengxian, moved by her mother's kind words, told her the truth. Zhou Yuan's words were sincere, as her daughter would eventually marry. Furthermore, the damage was done, and the situation was irreversible. So, she said to Fengxian, "If Lu is sincere in his love for you, he should engage a matchmaker to formalize the marriage. Don't let people ridicule you for living together illicitly." Fengxian was very grateful for her mother's intention and obediently agreed. Two days later, Lu Xiangzhou, along with his friend Zhou Fenglin and a person nicknamed "Toad," came to the Zhou's house to meet Zhou Yuan and discuss the marriage arrangements. Zhou Yuan then said that Fengxian was her eldest daughter and could not be casually buried. She feared that if they lived together, it would tarnish her family's reputation and invite gossip. Therefore, they must follow ancient customs for marriage. If they were serious, they should present betrothal gifts. The mother would accept tea and respectfully send the betrothal card. Then, they would choose an auspicious day for the wedding. However, the bride price would be 300 yuan. They should quickly raise the money to expedite the matter. Lu Xiangzhou readily agreed, saying that he would return to Pudong at the end of the month to inform his mother and raise the funds, promising to bring the bride back in the eighth lunar month when the osmanthus flowers were fragrant and the moon was full. He hoped they would all uphold the agreement. Both parties were pleased and parted ways. Unexpectedly, on the 25th of this month, Zhou Yuan instructed Fengxian to fetch water from the communal water boiler. The mother waited at home, but after half an hour, her daughter had not returned with the water. She sent her son to find out what his sister was doing outside. The son went to the water boiler and saw the water pot, but his sister was nowhere to be found. He brought the pot home and told his mother. The mother went out to look and saw her daughter and Lu whispering near an alleyway. Zhou Yuan was furious and scolded Lu, "Why don't you go find the money to formalize the marriage? Why are you just fooling around? Aren't you ashamed?" Lu replied in embarrassment, "I came to tell Fengxian that the marriage has been arranged and I have no other intentions." Then he said to Fengxian, "Do you understand?" Fengxian said, "I understand." Zhou Yuan knew there was a hidden meaning in these words, meaning she was forcing Fengxian to go home and scolding her. The young girl, who knew no shame, was being ridiculed by the neighbors. How would she face people in the future? After being scolded by her mother, Fengxian immediately started crying and arguing, then ran out of the house, disappearing like a distant crane, no one knew where. Zhou Yuan knew the reason and was furious, vowing to catch her. She searched everywhere. Yesterday morning, she saw Lu and Fengxian walking together at Nanyang Bridge in Ximen. She went forward to seize them. Lu and the girl fled, and she called the police, who apprehended them and took them to the Second District Police Station. The mother requested punishment, saying she no longer desired the marriage. After hearing this, Fengxian's expression changed dramatically. She looked around and, finding no one, untied her belt in the detention center, tied it to a pillar, and attempted to hang herself. A patrolman saw her and quickly struck her down with a blow, ordering her mother to watch over her to prevent another attempt. He immediately reported to the district chief. After questioning, the girl was sent to the District Court for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Resurrection</h3>
<p>Dead for Three Hours</p>
<p>Revived and Strong</p>
<p>Wang Zhaomei, 36 years old, a native of Hebei, lives in Yiheli, Lujiazui, Pudong. He works as a porter at the Longmao Wharf. He has a wife and a seven- or eight-year-old son. The mother and son often pick up coal scraps on the Bund to sell and supplement the family income. For several months, Wang has been suffering from rheumatism, confined to bed, unable to move his limbs, and lacking the means to treat it. Ten days ago, the landlord forced the whole family to move out. Wang's wife had no choice but to build a reed shed on a nearby open space and live there with her husband and son. Wang's illness continued to worsen. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at 5 p.m., he died. His wife immediately went to a sand factory in Caojiadu to inform her husband's brother to come to Pudong to help with the funeral arrangements. They quickly purchased clothes, hats, and shoes for the deceased to wear, and also bought a coffin. However, before the coffin could be carried to the house, after about three hours, the deceased suddenly revived. After a while, he became clear-headed. He saw the incense, candles, and paper money at the head of the bed and questioned his wife. His wife was greatly surprised and asked if he knew about being dead for three hours. He said he had been tired and sleeping soundly. However, his wife and brother had dressed him without him waking up or showing any signs of breathing. He was indeed dead and resurrected. They suspected that his lifespan was not yet over, so they went to notify the coffin shop to return the coffin. The story spread, and nearby residents regarded it as a miracle, flocking to see what was happening. At that time, it was raining heavily, and the area was flooded. The curious onlookers were barefooted and watched, marveling at the event. Yesterday, the man was still lying in the reed shed, in good spirits, but he had not yet taken off the shoes and socks he wore after death.</p>
<h3>Trial of Liu Nianchun's Kidnappers Begins</h3>
<p>Liu Testifies in Person</p>
<p>Kidnappers Claim to be Law-Abiding</p>
<p>Liu Nianchun, the owner of the Dingkang Gold Shop on Ningbo Road, was kidnapped twice by kidnappers at 6:15 p.m. on the 5th of last month in front of his residence at No. 922 North Chengdu Road. He was hidden in a hideout, and a ransom of 40,000 yuan was demanded. Subsequently, Liu's family paid a ransom of 20,000 yuan. Chief Detective Cao Ashan and Detective Ruan Yao of the Xinzha Police Station arrested Yu Baoren from Wuxi, one of the kidnappers in Suzhou. He was transferred to Shanghai and sent to the Special District Court for questioning. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Yuan continued the trial in the Second Criminal Court. According to the plaintiff, Liu Nianchun, a Ningbo native, 43 years old, gold industry, on the 5th of last month, I was traveling with my wife in a car, driven by chauffeur Lu Xiangyu. Just as we were about to start, three kidnappers, each holding a pistol, jumped into the car and sped towards Pudong. The driver, who seemed to be the defendant in this case, drove to Gongping Road, where the kidnappers forced my wife and chauffeur out of the car. Shortly after, at one place, several other kidnappers boarded the car and replaced the previous three kidnappers, who drove directly to the hideout. It seems to be specially built for hiding the kidnap victims, since the building was constructed with thick bricks around the outside, with only a skylight on the roof, and where one could not see the road all day. I was imprisoned in the room for several days, the conditions were so hot that I was covered in prickly heat. Later, my family contacted the kidnappers and paid a ransom of 20,000 yuan to be released, etc. The defendant confessed that the facts were that he was fooled. I have been driving for more than ten years, and I have always been law-abiding and have never committed a crime. I ask for a clear investigation. Attorney Wang Yaotang from the police station and Attorney Wang Fuchang, the agent lawyer extended by the plaintiff Liu Nianchun, rose to argue once, requesting severe punishment according to the law, and the defendant was also defended by a lawyer appointed by the court. Judge Sun then announced that the debate in this case was concluded and the verdict would be announced next Thursday. The defendant was remanded into custody.</p>
<h3>Trial of the Key Criminal in the Yongjia Case</h3>
<p>Yan Shibao Denies the Charges</p>
<p>The Yongjia County Government, due to Yan Shibao, a native of the county residing at No. 131 Xinjibang Road in the Public Concession, having committed a serious crime in Wenzhou, sent a letter to the Special District Court requesting the issuance of a warrant to arrest Yan and detain him for questioning. Yang Cangsheng from Guangdong and Zhao Shunde, a local, were involved in this case. Chief Detective Lu Liankui arrested them at No. 1171 Xinzha Road and No. 339 Beihai Road and brought them to the Huishan Police Station. Yesterday morning, they were brought to the Third Criminal Court of the Special Court together with Yan Shibao. Attorney Zhang Tianyin, representing the police station, presented the case. Yan Shibao then testified that in February of this year, I was at the East Asia Hotel. Yang Cangsheng introduced Qiu and Hu to Zhu Abao, who was at large, to discuss the purchase of 30 Mauser pistols. I paid 4,000 yuan as a deposit. I heard that Qiu was the magistrate of Yongjia County and Hu was the director of the China Merchants Bureau. Later, because they failed to deliver the firearms on time, they became angry with me. As for the purpose of the firearms, they said they were for the security forces to suppress bandits. Later, my friend Zhao Shunde issued a guarantee, and I signed the guarantee. The amount of the guarantee was 2,000 yuan. As for the charges of committing crimes in Wenzhou, they are all unfounded. Yang Cangsheng, when questioned, denied having purchased firearms. Zhao Shunde testified that he did not know about the purchase of firearms. He also retained Attorney Fan Gang to defend him. Judge Ge, considering the complexity of the case, ordered the two defendants Yang and Zhao to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Pan Yunling Sentenced for Murder</h3>
<p>Imprisoned in Xilao for Five Years</p>
<p>Zhao Jinbiao, a native of Hebei residing on Bailaini Monmalang Road in the French Concession, was shot and killed by an enemy on the evening of October 2nd of last year while going out for a bath with a friend. The police later arrested the murderer. Recently, Wang Zhang, Zhao's mistress, met the murderer, Pan Yunling, from Shandong, in the Public Concession. She immediately apprehended Pan and brought him to the Public Concession Police Station, who then transferred him to the French Court for investigation yesterday morning. First, the plaintiff, Wang Zhang, testified that I was acquainted with the defendant. Because he did not work, I asked him to work for me to make a living. He also wanted to sell my child, so I separated from him. After that, I became acquainted with the deceased Zhao Jinbiao. The defendant found out about this and murdered Zhao Jinbiao. He also threatened to kill me. I happened to meet him on the road that day, so I turned him in to be investigated. Pan Yunling, when questioned, testified that Wang Zhang is my wife. Last year, Zhao Jinbiao forcibly took her as his wife and sold my daughter. He also used his connections with officials in the mainland to imprison me for six months. After I was released, I had nothing. Therefore, I resented him and killed Zhao. I borrowed the pistol from a friend. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Pan Yunling to five years in Xilao, and then deportation.</p>
<h3>Baoshan Rebuilding Collapsed Fishing Bridge</h3>
<p>Engineering of the arsenal to conduct a survey</p>
<p>All bridge deck replaced with steel plates</p>
<p>The fishing bridge outside the south gate of Baoshan collapsed due to a truck carrying goods from the Shanghai Arsenal. The Shanghai Arsenal specially dispatched engineer Zhang Deqing to conduct a survey at the accident site yesterday. Engineer Zhang plans to rebuild the bridge as a steel plate bridge, widening the bridge deck. The steel plates will be purchased from the railway bureau's old materials, and the lower bridge piers will still be made of stone, but they must be enlarged. The bridge deck materials will be purchased by the arsenal, and the lower bridge pier project will be handled by the Baoshan County Construction Bureau. Baoshan County Magistrate Qiu Mingjiu believes that the bridge is very important to transportation and that rebuilding it as a steel bridge is more solid. However, the funds needed to rebuild the stone piers (i.e., bridge piers) have not been secured, so a meeting of local public groups must be convened to discuss fundraising to make preparations.</p>
<h3>Criminal Investigation Team Uncovers Extortion Case</h3>
<p>Liang Lingfu, a 63-year-old Guangdong native, has been running the Ruitai Stone Powder Factory on Route Loybes since years prior. He has considerable savings. Unexpectedly, in early June of this year, according to the lunar calendar, he received four consecutive extortion letters demanding 5,000 yuan. At the time, Liang was magnanimous and ignored them. However, as the number of letters increased and the wording became more severe, Liang could no longer tolerate it. He secretly reported all the letters to the Second Precinct of the Fifth District. Although the precinct chief sent officers in disguise to make the arrest, the operation was not discreet enough, and nothing was gained. Afterward, the criminals became more aggressive and sent two more warning letters with even harsher language. After receiving the letters, Liang ordered his son, Liang Shubin (38 years old), to secretly report the case to the Criminal Investigation Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau together with his cousin Liu Jinbiao, while negotiating the address with the criminals several times. As a result, the criminals agreed to 1,500 yuan. He made an appointment to hand over the money near the Huayang Baoxing Store at the intersection of Baoshan Road from 8 to 9 p.m. yesterday. So, Liu Jinbiao secretly reported to Team Leader Lu a day in advance, and he secretly dispatched Zhabei team leaders Wang Shifu and Su Sheng, and detectives Liu Yongfu and Lv Xingchun, etc., to go in disguise at the appointed time and guard the area until 8:45, when they saw a criminal slowly approaching. Liu first handed over a package of counterfeit banknotes to the criminal. Just as the criminal was about to leave with the money, they were intercepted by the detectives and immediately brought back to the team for a preliminary interrogation. According to the criminal, his name is Chen Yueqing, 28 years old, a native of Shaoxing, and he lives in the Baoxing Theater on Baoxing Road. He used to be the manager of the Minsheng Veneer Chair Factory and often sipped tea at the Yile Tea House at the intersection of Nanjing Road. He claimed that the matter was instigated by Chen Qifa, an employee of the Ruitai Factory. According to the confession, Team Leader Lu ordered the original investigating officers to go to the factory and arrest Chen Qifa. According to the confession, Chen Qifa is 41 years old and a native of Shangyu. He has been working at the factory for 13 years. In February of this year, because Yao, the accountant of the factory, went to Chenqiaoshan in Huzhou to pay wages, he was kidnapped by bandits on the way. At that time, Manager Liang sent me (Chen himself claimed) to Huzhou to inquire about the news. Not long after, I returned to Shanghai. In March, I happened to meet an old friend, Hu Ziguang, whom I had not seen for many years on the road of the city. At that time, we went to a Yile Tea House together for tea. We each talked about the situation after we separated. At that time, Hu greeted the person who was arrested (that is, Chen Yueqing), and we sat down at the same table. I also briefly talked with Hu about inquiring Yao's situation. Unexpectedly, Chen asked the name of the boss of Ruitai on the side. I truthfully replied. The conversation lasted about an hour, and I separated from the people until the sixth month of the old calendar. Manager Liang suddenly received several threatening letters, etc. When Chen Yueqing was questioned, he confessed that Chen Qifa did not instigate the incident. At the time, he hoped to be lightly sentenced. After Team Leader Lu clarified, he immediately prepared a document and sent it to the Judicial Section for review.</p>
<h3>Explosion of Percussion Explosive Injures People</h3>
<p>One Worker and One Apprentice Injured</p>
<p>At 2:30 p.m. yesterday, Wang Sheng San, a patrol officer from the Liyuan Road Substation of the Second District General Bureau of the Nanshi Public Security Bureau, was about to go out to inspect the posts when he suddenly heard a loud explosion about half a li southwest of the substation. The houses shook, and he knew something was wrong. He immediately led several long-term police officers to investigate the sound. They learned that a percussion explosive on a mortar shell made by the Dahua Iron Factory at No. 49 Caotang Street had suddenly exploded, injuring two workers, Sun You Sheng (22 years old, Shaoxing native) and an apprentice, Hong Rongkang (15 years old, Ningbo native). According to Wang Zhongxuan, the accountant of the factory, the Chen Binji Machine Factory in Hongkou obtained a license from the arsenal to make percussion grenades, and Chen Binji entrusted the Dahua Factory to help make the copper shell outside the percussion fire. Chen Binji sent two workers to supervise the construction in the factory. During the moment of improper drug loading, a sudden explosion occurred, destroying a part of the sundries, and injured the two workers, Sun You Sheng and Hong Rongkang. Sun was burned all over his body and his situation was critical. The apprentice, Hong Rongkang, was only injured in his right foot and was not seriously injured. The two have now been sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. After Officer Wang investigated, he immediately found a percussion fire and prepared a document to submit to the Second District General Bureau for review.</p>
<h3>One Bandit Apprehended in Teahouse</h3>
<p>At around 6:30 p.m. yesterday, Qi Haitian, a team leader of the Criminal Investigation Team of the First Police Station of the Fourth District of Zhabei, apprehended Zhao Yukun, 33 years old, a native of Changzhou, at the Pinfang Teahouse on Mongolia Road, for being involved in a kidnapping case in Zhabei. After a preliminary interrogation by Director Yao, he was sent to the bureau for review.</p>
<h3>Bandit Gu Zhenhua Hangs Himself in Jail</h3>
<p>On the 25th of this month, Chinese and Western detectives from the Xinzha Police Station arrested bandits including Gu Zhenhua, discovering that they had repeatedly committed robbery five times. The next morning, they were sent to the Special District Court for questioning. The police station's detention center is extremely narrow, each room can only hold three people, and every three rooms make up a large room. Gu and the others were inside, and because the weather was quite cold, the prisoners in the three rooms slept together, a total of nine people. Yesterday morning, the prisoner Yu Baoren woke up and got up to urinate. Suddenly, he saw that there were only seven people left, one less than usual. He carefully observed that Gu Zhenhua was nowhere to be seen. He then discovered that Gu was hanging from the beams, having already hanged himself to death. He then reported to the Western police in the detention center, who took Gu down. Because the time had passed for so long, there was no way to return his soul. The body was sent by car to the Fiolent Road Autopsy Office. At 9:30, a report was made to the Special District Court, and Inspector Guo Wei was commissioned to come to the office to examine the body and ascended to the public office. The Western deputy detective reported the previous situation and said that the family members of the deceased, Gu San, Gu Shen, and the witness Yu Baoren, had arrived to be questioned. Yu Baoren, when questioned, said that he was 29 years old, a native of Wuxi, and was detained in the same place as the prisoner Gu. The discovery of the deceased was too late to save him. Gu San reported that Gu Zhenhua was my son, and I can now collect the body. Inspector Guo Yu said that the bandit Gu Zhenhua was confirmed to have committed suicide before his death. The body was handed over to the corpse father Gu San for burial.</p>
<h3>Woman Commits Suicide by Swallowing Opium</h3>
<p>The woman, Gu Chen, was in her prime. She had lived in the countryside, where her husband was unemployed and had no way to make a living. Later, she followed her husband's friend, Chen Tingshen, to Shanghai to make a living, residing at No. 2526 Renxing Street, Yangshupu. However, the woman's beauty was quite good, which caused the rogues in the neighborhood to covet her. The owner of the big pancake shop next door, Lao Si, lingered in front of the door every day, but the woman did not pay attention to him. A few days ago, Chen Tingshen suddenly asked the woman about the rumor that Lao Si had raped her, and Wang, who lived with the woman, was said to have been involved. Chen believed that although the matter was not true, there must be a reason. Therefore, he slightly questioned the woman, saying, "Your husband came to Shanghai, what face do I have to face him?" The woman was very unhappy and secretly swallowed opium to commit suicide. She was later discovered and taken to the hospital for treatment, but died. The Yangshupu Police Station ordered detective Xu Guirong to investigate the matter. The body was taken to the autopsy office. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, the inspector of the Final District Court, came to the office and confirmed that the deceased had died from opium smoking. The police chief said that Lao Si and Wang had fled after hearing the news and should be ordered to be arrested. Guo then ordered the body to be handed over to Chen Tingshen for burial and issued warrants for the arrest of Lao Si and Wang for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Mud Craftsman Hu Jinrong Hangs Himself</h3>
<p>Hu Jinquan, a 27-year-old mud craftsman from Chuansha, borrowed a bunk in the home of Zhang Xu, an old woman at No. 16 Chenjiazhai, Bailaini Monmalang Road, in the French Concession. Recently, he suffered from severe headaches and felt economically distressed, so he had a sudden short-sighted idea. He hanged himself in the loft where he slept on the afternoon before yesterday. At 7 p.m., the landlady Xu called him to eat but he did not respond. She went up to the loft to find him and saw him. She called the neighbors to take him down, but he was already out of breath and cold. She immediately reported to the police station. There were no corpses. The body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall Autopsy Office. There were no relatives of the corpse. Yesterday, the criminal section of the French Police Station reported to the French Court Judge Zhu to come to the office. He confirmed that the deceased had committed suicide. He ordered a photo to be taken, and the court collected the coffin at the altar to summon the leader.</p>
<h3>Hongqiao Road</h3>
<p>Farmer Struck by Lightning Has Not Yet Been Buried</p>
<p>Must be Exposed for Three Days and Nights</p>
<p>Otherwise the Place Will be Unlucky</p>
<p>The farmer Zhang Asi, who was struck by lightning to death behind the house of the 29th Bao, 2nd Tu, Hongqiao Road, on the south bank of the Changsheng Bridge (west of Mike Road) on the afternoon before yesterday, was already reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Zhang Asi was 55 years old and lived at No. 13 Zhangjiata. His wife, Ma, ran away after passing through the door and has not been seen since. Therefore, there is only Asi in the family besides an ox. He was very dangerous to the neighbors in the clan. On the afternoon before yesterday, he carried a basket to the Ao Tang near the place to cut grass for cattle. He died after being electrocuted twice. According to the eyewitness villagers, before his death, black smoke covered him and no one could be seen. After the thunder passed, Zhang Asi was lying diagonally on the bank of the pond, breathless. In an instant, the number of onlookers was like the Mountain Yin Road. Until yesterday morning, it has not been buried. The chief of the dispatched office ordered the police to summon Chen Bohan, the local guarantor, and Zhang Huolin, Zhang's clan nephew, to the office to await the verdict. However, the villagers generally follow the custom that people who are struck by lightning must be exposed for three days and nights before they can be buried, otherwise, it will be unlucky for the place, and Zhang has no family members, only two nieces (who have been married). They have to wait until the nieces arrive before they can be buried.</p>
<h3>Car Injures Person Attempt to Destroy it</h3>
<p>However, the Car Did Not Injure Anyone</p>
<p>Rousing Trouble May Have Other Reasons</p>
<p>At 10 p.m. the day before yesterday, someone suddenly knocked violently on the door of the Qinhua Lime Factory in Zhoujiaqiao, west of Shanghai. The doorman of the factory heard the sound and opened the door. Suddenly, a large group of people resembling workers, about 30 or 40 people, rushed in and aggressively claimed that the truck carrying goods must be dragged out and destroyed. Huang Yangshan, the accountant of the factory, did not know the reason, but due to the large number of people, it was difficult to reason with them. He immediately sent someone to report to the Second Substation of the Sixth District and sent the police to the scene. When the workers saw the police arriving, they fled. They arrested two of the leaders, a child, and two witnesses, and brought them to the Sixth District Police Station. After being questioned separately by District Chief Ren, Huang Yangshan, the plaintiff, stated that he was 38 years old and a native of Zhejiang. He served as the accountant at the Qinhua Lime Factory. At 9 o'clock tonight, Li Lianming and Lu Ajin led 30 to 40 people to knock on the factory door and swarm in, aggressively attempting to destroy the truck carrying goods. He had no idea why and asked them to be investigated. According to the defendant Lu Ajin, he was 32 years old, a native of Suzhou, and lived in the third house of the six-room house in Jiangjiajiao, Zhoujiaqiao. He was a worker at the Shenxin Factory. In the evening, his son Ruigen, who was only six years old, was playing at the door when he was knocked down by a Qinhua truck and injured his head. Therefore, he planned to retaliate. According to Li Lianming, 32 years old, a native of Yancheng, residing at No. 51, 40 room house, worker driver, was asked by Lu to help, so he went to the factory together. According to the witnesses, one named Zhang Jingwen and the other named Xu Jiuren, Qinhua's truck did not hit anyone, and the car was in the factory in the evening. After obtaining the confession, District Chief Ren considered that the defendant intentionally aroused the public to cause trouble, which was obviously a malicious accusation. Yesterday, he prepared a document and sent it to the District Court for trial.</p>

Southern Anhui is especially fertile and prosperous. The so-called bandits are only seen by the people of Anhui in newspapers. If there are any, it is only after the rise of the revolutionary army and the downfall of the warlords. When soldiers scattered and became bandits, and when the army collapsed, it was like a factory producing bandits when they were released. Guangde County is adjacent to eastern Zhejiang. Bandits have used it as a place to come and go for many years. Since the rampant bandits in Taihu Lake, the situation has become more intense. The counties of Xuan, Guang, and Langxi are restless. Although government troops have repeatedly rushed to suppress them, they are tired of running around. The Garrison Regiment of the First Garrison Headquarters stationed in Anhui Province had previously been ordered to return to the capital. However, a battalion was still left in Guangde to guard against bandits. It can be seen that they cannot be ignored. The bandits have a leader named Three Legs. He is exceptionally fierce. The women and children of Guangde all know that he is like a flying thief. He can travel three or four hundred miles in a day. Hence the name Three Legs. He has a black horse. It gallops like lightning. It is a divine steed. Having such a man and such a horse, the name of Three Legs became even more well-known. The relatives and bandits under his command are also exceptionally brave. The government troops suppressing the bandits pay even more attention to Three Legs. A month ago, Battalion Commander Feng Jinghai of the Third Garrison Regiment led his troops to suppress bandits in Guangde. The bandits had been scattered. It was discovered that the Three Legs gang was hiding in a certain mountain. So soldiers were dispersed to surround and capture them. Just as the deployment was completed, Three Legs appeared. He held a Mauser pistol in each hand. He leaped to the top of the mountain and shouted to the government soldiers, "Are you here to capture Three Legs? I am Three Legs. But I am not a bandit willingly. It is the politics that drives me. It is hunger and cold that forces me. How much do you brothers get per month? We are all doing it for food. Why must you force me too much? But I will never surrender and be captured so you can get credit and rewards. The caves in this mountain are complex and numerous. You cannot know them all. I will now leave from a certain cave in a certain direction. Please wait for me there. If I am captured, so be it." After speaking, he disappeared through a path. Battalion Commander Feng was then inspecting the troops. He knew that Three Legs claimed to be a hero of the greenwood and that his words should not be false. So he secretly deployed machine guns, Mauser pistols, etc. at the entrance of a certain cave. Soon, Three Legs indeed led his men out. Suddenly, official bullets rained down, directly hitting the entrance of the cave. But Three Legs actually opened fire with both hands at that moment and shouted loudly. He leaped away. Only one or two of his men were injured. Battalion Commander Feng is a young and brave military officer. The soldiers are also veterans. But they could do nothing against Three Legs. After Mr. Feng returned to Wuhu, he talked to a friend about it. He still deeply lamented that Three Legs possessed unique skills but had gone astray. A Strange Death – Bi Ren A neighbor, Mr. Zhang, was enjoying the cool air in his courtyard after dinner yesterday. While chatting with friends, a Mr. Wang jokingly said to Zhang, "Can you drink three bottles of soda?" Mr. Zhang immediately said he could. So the two made a bet on who would be the host. They ordered a servant to buy half a dozen sodas. Three bottles were given to the friends. The rest were drunk by Mr. Zhang himself. In a short while, they were finished. Everyone admired his capacity. Mr. Wang lost the bet. Half an hour later, Mr. Zhang felt a slight bloating and pain in his stomach. He knew something was wrong. He quickly took ten drops of medicine. It was of no use. The pain increased. His face turned pale, as if he was dying. Everyone was shocked. They quickly summoned a Western doctor. It was too late to save him. According to the Western doctor, in the hot summer, people drink cold things to seek temporary pleasure. Little do they know that this injures their own bodies. Soda is especially harmful. When soda enters the stomach, the intestines expand. Excessive expansion leads to death. Alas. Shouldn't we pay more attention to this? The Tragedy at Ye Garden Swimming – Li Qingdu The early autumn weather is still hot. The enthusiasm of those who love to swim has not diminished. Gardens and springs are full of swimmers. They use them to escape the heat. A Mr. He from Derong Lane in Zhabei, for the sake of cooling off, took the opportunity of Sunday (the 24th) to invite friends to visit Ye Family Garden in Jiangwan. A group of more than 20 men, women, and children went together by car at 9:00 AM. After arriving at the garden, they explored separately. Some climbed the artificial mountains. Some sat in the shade. Some strolled and looked at the flowers. Each enjoyed themselves. Several people even played the game of bamboo fighting. Thus, those who had traveled together in a group separated and rested. Their movements scattered. Swimming in the Pond The garden draws water to form a pond. It surrounds the area. The shallow parts are one or two feet deep. The deep parts are six or seven feet deep. It is quite clear. Visitors are allowed to swim in the pond. The garden managers do not stop them. There were many visitors that day. There were quite a few who were playing in the water. Among the group was Chen Shaonan, a member of the Zhabei Security Corps. He wanted to learn to swim. So at around 3:00 PM, taking advantage of his friend's unawareness, he secretly put on his friend's swimsuit. Drowned Tragically He went alone to the pond near the "Stone Dragon" in the garden. He jumped into the water. He didn't surface for a long time. A visitor passed by. Seeing this, he found it strange. So he ran to tell his companions. Soon, everyone gathered. They knew he had drowned. They quickly called for people to go into the water to rescue him. By the time he was carried to the shore, he was almost dead. His mouth was full of mud. His stomach was full of water. Only his breath had not yet stopped. Doctor's Rescue Fortunately, there were two doctors among the visitors. Hearing the news, they rushed over. They tried to rescue him. They wanted to make him vomit water and revive him. But it was impossible to bring him back to life. So they abandoned him by the roadside. White foam was flowing from his mouth. The scene was extremely tragic. Seeing this, his companions were shocked and despaired. They were helpless. They could only grieve and sigh. The younger ones were even speechless and pale. They had not expected such a tragic event to occur. After the accident, the garden manager quickly reported it to the Jiangwan Police Station by telephone. He invited the chief of the station to come and investigate. At the same time, he sent someone to the deceased's residence at No. 8 Defu Lane, Chuan Highway, Zhabei. He asked his family to come to the garden to claim the body. Visitors Detained The garden manager thought that the murder was a major event. He did not want to let the visitors leave and leave the body in the garden. This would cause serious trouble. So he immediately locked the gate. No one was allowed to leave the garden. The beautiful garden became a temporary prison. Some people tried to escape by climbing over the wall. They looked quite embarrassed. The rest sat quietly and waited for the aftermath. Soon, the chief of the police station arrived at the garden. He inspected the scene. He determined that the deceased had drowned himself. No one else was involved. So he didn't say anything. By about 6:00 PM, the deceased's family arrived. They claimed the body. First, it was carried out of the garden. Then it was moved to the Yue Shang Hospital for burial. Signed Release The body had been claimed. The garden manager didn't investigate further. He discussed it with the chief of the police station. He ordered the visitors to write down their names and addresses one by one. Only then did he open the gate and release them. But everyone was quite frightened. The deceased was only 23 years old. He had a wife. Now he lost his life while learning to swim. This caused a young woman to lose her support. This is also very sad. Random Notes on Dysentery – Ma Yinliang Dysentery is a disease that often occurs in late summer and early autumn. It is common in Shanghai every year. This year it is even more serious. Children and the elderly are the most dangerous. They often die within two or three days due to heart failure and lack of physical strength. This cannot be ignored. I will say a few words to inform the public. (1) Diet People with dysentery should first endure hunger. There is a saying that eating doesn't kill dysentery. This statement should never be believed. I often see cases where a mild illness becomes serious due to eating arbitrarily. There are also cases where the illness has gradually healed, but it recurs due to improper diet. Dysentery is a disease in the intestines. If you eat more food to stimulate the intestines, the disease will only increase. The principle is very clear. Therefore, dysentery can be killed by eating. Enduring hunger is never harmful. Only liquid juices such as boiled water, fruit juice, and rice soup are harmless. (2) Stop Diarrhea Diarrhea should not be stopped at the beginning of dysentery. It should be given a laxative to cause a large bowel movement. There are often patients' families who see the patient having frequent diarrhea, tenesmus, and a weak appearance. They often ask, "Can he withstand more diarrhea?" This statement seems reasonable at first, but it is not. What the patient is excreting is toxins that hinder the health of the body. How can there be a reason to store toxins in the body? Therefore, if the patient really cannot take a laxative, an enema should be used to remove the filth from the body. In this way, the intestines will be clean, and the disease will be easily cured. (3) Treatment The treatment for dysentery is, first, to clean the intestines, second, to kill the pathogenic microorganisms, and third, to stop the diarrhea. All three must be diagnosed and treated in detail by a doctor. Prescriptions are taken orally or by injection. It usually takes eight to ten days to recover. However, the severity of the disease varies, and the physical strength of people varies. Therefore, the recovery time is also different. This depends on the doctor's efforts, and the patient's family should also absolutely follow his instructions. (4) Prevention The pathogens of dysentery are dysentery bacteria or dysentery amoeba (also known as amoeba). Both can be detected in the patient's stool under a microscope. They enter the human body through the mouth. From the stomach to the intestines, diarrhea and fever occur. Therefore, the prevention method can be summarized in one sentence: "Pay attention to the cleanliness of food and drink." If there is a patient with dysentery in the family, the excrement should be disinfected with stinky water. The fingers of the person serving are most easily contaminated. They should be washed frequently with medicated soap. Special attention should be paid when eating. In addition, the reaction to the injection of prophylactic vaccine is too severe. Most people don't like it. German Political Parties Before the Election (Part 1) – Li Liu Zeng, sent from Paris In my last communication, I mentioned that on the day after the German parliament was dissolved, various political parties were already actively preparing for the upcoming election battle. In the past half month, various political parties have been working hard to strengthen internal unity and consolidate their existing positions. On the other hand, they are pulling and attracting each other, seeking to unite with different parties in order to achieve cooperative effects in the election battle and form a larger force in the future parliament. The changes are unpredictable and the future is still chaotic. It is difficult to make any judgments at this time. The merger of the remnants of the National People's Party led by Xiao Zhenbai and Hitler's racial faction has not yet been successful. The most right-wing National Socialist Party has a strong intention to absorb the remaining members of Xiao's party. The efforts of Duke Weista and Trier Willanu have united the rebellious elements of the National People's Party, but the land system of the most right-wing still advocates autonomy. In addition, Si Keerci, the leader of the Populist Party, once issued a declaration in the name of the party, advocating that independent national factions, economic factions, and democratic factions should unite with the party during the election, so as to form a Christian faction in the next parliament to compete with the Catholic faction. But so far this proposal has not had any effect. Overall, all the above activities give people a sense of confusion. In this ongoing election battle, what is more eye-catching and clear-cut is a newly established party, the German Government Party. Most of the founders of the new party are members of the Democratic Party. The current Minister of Finance, Dietrich, is one of the important members. The establishment of the new party is entirely due to environmental pressure. Premier Bruling's decision to dissolve the parliament was due to the fact that he could not obtain a majority in the parliament to pass the government's financial bill. Second, the centrist parties that maintained the government were in danger of extinction. These centrist parties had already suffered great losses in the last election, and internal conflicts and disputes further contributed to the decline of their power. Since the government's plan to unite with the right wing to deal with the Social Democratic Party failed, these centrists are now gradually disintegrating between the two major parties on the left and right. To rescue these parties, the only way is to thoroughly transform these parties, abandon their inherent policies, doctrines, and outdated ideas, and combine them into one under the conditions that can gain the trust of the German people and be reborn. Warmth in My Heart (265) – Bao Tianxiao Fourteenth Episode: Green Bamboo Tears Stain the Lady's Heart, Red Lotus Fragrance Fades, and a Maiden's Soul Departs Let's talk about Qian Nong from Baihua. She was Cui Yun from Puqing Lane before. Now that she's coming out again, she feels much older than before. Thinking about the courtesans in their class, they often marry and then come out again. Of course, there are many unavoidable hardships. But there are also many prostitutes who regard marriage as a kind of policy. Generally speaking, people in Qu Yuan are used to luxury and spend money without restriction. Because they feel that money comes easily, it also goes easily. Therefore, out of ten famous prostitutes, it can be inferred that at least nine are in debt. But once they are on the debt platform, they can immediately continue to grow higher. Originally, there was a group of people in the prostitution society who specialized in lending money for a living. They are called Yangdian Brokers. The interest rate is 2% or 3% per month. There are also many benefits, such as splitting shares. For example, if you borrow 1,000 yuan from them, less than one section of interest is more than 100 yuan. If you don't pay it back in a year, the interest will be 300 or 400 yuan. They see that your business is very good and say, "Miss Three, Miss Four, putting foreign money with you is the safest thing. Now the principal and interest are 1,400 yuan. If you find another 600 yuan and make it 2,000 yuan, it will be easier to calculate." All famous prostitutes always spend money lavishly. They just want to show off and don't care about anything else. They use it first and then think about it. 1,000 becomes 2,000 so easily, and 2,000 becomes 2,000, then 4,000 or 5,000. This debt platform rises higher and higher. When it cannot be resolved, they hope for a "soft egg" (a fool). That "soft egg" is the rich man. At this time, a good famous prostitute is really forced to do so. She has to use her manipulative skills, set up a bewitching array, and trap this fool. She makes him take on the debt she owes. Temporarily, she gives her body to him. When the time is right, she can still run away. The jargon for this is "bathing." She washes away all her debts and then comes out again to live that kind of romantic and enjoyable life. Some even continue to incur debt and then "bathe" again. The prostitution creditor group hopes to lend money to that kind of lady. They can extract heavy profits. Later, many Chinese bankers also learned their method. They lent money to the warlords. They let them fight for cities and land. They extracted huge profits from it. The warlord's debt platform was built higher and higher. When it could not be resolved, they all pushed it onto the people. The people are a group of "soft eggs," while the bankers made money. However, the warlord's "bathing" is more cruel than the prostitute's "bathing." The prostitute still has a warm and soft body to accompany you. The warlord only has bombs, cannons, and machine guns to offer. Although the prostitute doesn't necessarily have any savings after "bathing," the warlord leaves behind a mess and scrapes together a lot of money for himself. He goes abroad to live as a rich man, while the "soft egg" people bear the huge debt.</p>

<p>Commercial News Finance Gold Market Continues Downward Trend, Extremely Turbulent Yesterday, the gold price continued to fall, but the market was panicked, the fluctuations were uncertain, and people were separated, with many underlying factors. There were both high and low prices of over ten taels, generally hovering around 550 taels. The market moved between upward and downward pressure, with a turbulent and unstoppable trend. Foreign exchange rates, both official and unofficial, loosened, with the listed rate increasing by one level. Banks slightly increased their purchases, while trading in the market remained relatively high. Dealers such as Yuansheng, Yuanxing, Yongyuan, and Maoyong sold a lot, while Dalian gangs and retail investors purchased. The morning market trend was weak, stimulated by the rise in silver bars, with large dealers selling vigorously. Exchange rates also declined, and the market suddenly dropped below the 50-tael mark, falling by more than ten taels. Afterwards, the demand exceeded the supply, with the market initially declining but then rising rapidly by ten taels, exceeding 50 taels. Market sentiment turned from weak to strong, and exchange rates also improved, showing a strong trend. The market closed at 56 taels, with two recordings in the afternoon and evening markets (double settlement price). In the morning, the London telegraph reported that silver bars increased by one-eighth, and American silver increased by one-half. Previous Closing Plunges The October market opened lower by 3.4 mace, at 556.2 taels, then fell from 57 taels to 2.34 mace, mainly due to strong selling intentions from various dealers.

Mitsui purchased spot Dalian silver at 1.255 mace, and Mait 行 and Datong Mutual conducted September American dollar transactions at 39.375 yuan, so the rate increased to 56 taels.

Several Upward Trends The afternoon market opened at 46.7 taels, then fell to 45.2 taels, due to the sudden increase of 10 ounces of Indian exchange, causing panic. Afterwards, the market gradually rose because buyers were active, mainly because British gold turned weak. McGarry purchased December gold at 7 pence 875, followed by Andaz吸 at 8125, and then in October, Meifeng and Shanghai did 625. The market then rose above the 50-tael mark, and around 3:00 PM, the market felt strong, showing a trend of rising further.

Shortly, Yancheng and the Japanese merchant Sanlin competed to buy, and the price rose rapidly, increasing by more than 5.6 taels in ten minutes, reaching 57.7 mace, then falling by 1.2 taels due to sales by Zhifeng and others. The market closed at 56.1 mace at 4:30 PM, decreasing by 3.5 mace compared to the previous day. The market then decreased slightly again, mainly due to continuous selling. Overall, the market situation was volatile and difficult to predict. The highest price of the day was 57.7 taels, and the lowest price was 45.2 taels, with a difference of 12.5 taels. The announced price ranged from 75.6 taels to 66.7 taels. The recordings were 59 taels in September and 48 taels in October in the morning, and 67 taels to 56 taels in the afternoon.

<h3>Ridiculous and Absurd Ghost Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Is the Death of the Wang Girl Related?</p>
<p>A few days ago, Zheng Zhonghan, a Cantonese resident of No. 4 Xingchang Gate on the Route Doumer (today's Huaihai Road), east of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company, hid thirteen silver dollars, divided into two bundles (one of nine dollars and one of four dollars), under the straw mat on his bed. The next day, when Zheng wanted to take the dollars to use, he suddenly discovered that the bundle of nine dollars was missing. He immediately inquired, but all the Cantonese residents living with him said they didn't know. Afterwards, to dispel suspicion from everyone, everyone voluntarily wrote their name and place of origin on a red slip, and a list of the circumstances of the lost dollars was also opened and taken to the City God Temple in the city to declare, and the written slips were burned in the large incense burner in the temple. Four days later, Bai'e, the young daughter of a Mr. Wang, who worked as a staff member on a ship and lived in the kitchen of the house, suddenly fell ill and lay in bed, speaking gibberish. A neighbor, A, told the girl's mother that the dollars Zheng had lost were taken by her daughter, because she saw her buying several silver rings and giving them to her young friends, and so on. Therefore, the girl's mother learned the truth and interrogated her daughter, who confessed the truth and handed over the remaining four dollars and some change. At that time, the girl's mother returned the original dollars to Zheng, but she needed to ask him to go to the City God Temple to withdraw the oath (that is, to close the case), and Zheng did everything accordingly, hoping that the patient would recover suddenly. Unexpectedly, her condition worsened yesterday morning and she died in an instant. The strangest thing is that after the girl died, two purple-red rope-shaped marks were found on her arm. Just as they were preparing for the funeral, the girl's father returned home and learned the cause of his daughter's death, so he negotiated with the Zheng family. However, Zheng said that he did not suspect the girl when he lost the dollars, and that she went to the temple to swear an oath, which was also done by several of our fellow villagers and did not involve her. Therefore, nearby neighbors who heard about such ghostly disturbances flocked to watch, and there were quite a few people.</p>
