<p>偉矣哉航空事業也舉凡交通之發展消息之傳播文化之灌輸軍事之進行以及其餘攸關國計民生之種種問題類多直接或間接利賴之惟其然也航空事業乃益爲世人所重視而航空安全問題亦遂日趨重要而爲世人所亟欲解决之者近世各國對於航空事業提倡之努力與夫各大製造廠家之殫精竭慮研究改良以冀增進航空之安全蓋皆深知其關係之重大不得不竭全力以求其日益進步而臻於完善之境耳</p>
<p>固特異航空胎輪之發明蓋爲促進航空安全之又一新方法亦即該公司之又一偉大成功固特異橡皮公司爲世界偉大橡皮廠之一魄力之雄厚出品之精優與夫規模之宏偉設備之周至固已馳譽全球而其蓋籌碩劃新猷百出尤爲世人所驚奇嘆服而稱道不止者此次該公司爲力謀所以增進航空安全起見爰特聚精會神刻苦研製終乃有此新胎輪之發明焉其榸構製式様根本革新其功用特點在使飛機之升降彌臻安全至其命名爲固特異航空胎輪則以充量空汽胎芯直接架於輪　於是邊也輻也輪也乃皆可以省去斯則兼有胎與輪之功用名之爲胎輪夫誰曰不宜</p>
<p>胎輪特色不一而足其犖犖大者厥爲價値不貲之輔助吸震器是因而可以省却儎重能力得以自然加大落地異常穩妥曳力特别高强雖遇冰雪泥沙動作亦殊自然絶無影響平穩之至是以常尋常所應有之地面設備於此乃非必要遇風而降落時因得益臻安全不僅此也航空胎輪具有最低壓力之較大的空氣容量故在普通使用情狀下獨能勝任重儎斯蓋歷經種種測騐而徵實者胎芯置於特製輪　之上内向擴張式制輪則或裝或否悉可任便行之此與標準式様蓋相同也按凡飛機裝用此種新式航空胎輪則降落地面時平穩軟適絶無震撼乘者幾致不辨其究於何時觸及地面於是機之壽命得以加長而尤足稱者裝　航空胎輪之飛機起飛時較之裝用高壓胎者彌覺便利而省力斯蓋以其於升高二寸至五寸時仍能藉輪之力以與地面相接觸也故凡地面所有一切障礙悉爲胎之本身明受無餘而飛機之進行乃不蒙絲毫影響固特異航空胎輪有此種種優點則其銷行暢旺蓋不卜可知矣</p>
<p>機架各部乃無破損折裝之虞至此種胎輪所以能明受震撼避免跳盪者以其壓力低而空氣容量大也即有震撼均已消散於其較大的空氣容量中矣再以胎輪之截面直徑與其高度相較特别長大故當降落時自然具有扁平或蹼狀脚掌的效用而機身觸及地面或積雪等處時因亦彌臻安全毫無危險若高壓力輪胎則或不免於撞撃等患矣</p>

<p>全國路政問題首推上海其次南京蓋上海自經中英條約開關爲商埠租界方面次第經營其路面之加闊路基之堅固房屋之收進車輪之行駛雖有八十餘年已往之歷史猶日益進展而未已即在華界方面閘北南市亦積極進行不遺餘力而况自北伐告成改爲特市之後對於路政尤加意興修如改建東門　　　舖柏油路面也注意人行道也西門之車輛交還也三載以還其成績之優越或有不亞於租界者至於南京則不然其街道之狹小陋隘路面之窒碍不平房屋之高下不齊雨後之泥塗淋滑固已無足諱惟自國民政府建都南京旣爲中華之首都又爲模範之市府對於以上種種之不良市容當然在積極改進之列其中山大道直逹孫陵各路交通期歸劃一現在雖不足與滬市較要之首善之區爲中外觀瞻所撃尤賴市政當局之注意其路面之崎嶇者應如何使之平坦街衢之湫隘者應如何之廣闊交通之有未便者應如何使之迅捷車輛之有肇禍者應如何使之减免庶可以樹各規而爲各地所則傚焉茲將京滬市之幹路路基築路材料選擇收地給價交通信號電車與公共汽車諸問題分别述之如左者並亦他石之助之意云爾</p>
<p>全市幹路　一市之交通欲其發逹與否賴端幹道之先定上海南京兩市已經先後將市内幹道計劃分别測量製成幹道計劃圖如上海兩租界一工部局對於全市幹道莫不有精確之地圖即港道之行舶街道之改寬亦均預先給製詳圖公佈市民則市民可依照工部局之計劃各自訂定不碍該市之計劃自由建築房屋也蓋幹　太狹於都市發逹有不能應付交通之所需幹道太寛則耗費地皮亦殊可惜此京兩市有鑒於租界之</p>
<h2>Page 27</h2>
<p>定幹道計劃而各將市内幹路製成詳圖以公諸市民也</p>
<p>築路地基　路基而堅則可行駛重大車輛路基而弱則路面易於損壞故上海兩工部局對於各處馬路路基築甚厚以十時以上爲最普通車輛雖多重車雖夥亦不致損壞其路面即上海市之道路除舊有不計外凡新築之道路亦在十時以上南京市之中山路亦在十時左右至京滬二市之路基石槪用大石塊故車輛衆多重車尤頻亦能擔負其重力蓋在工商發逹之區域重大車輛旣較他處爲多其路基允宜加厚若在行政住宅之各區幹送其重大車輛較少路基或不妨稍薄也</p>
<p>選擇材料　築路材料之選擇亦是重要工程之一而柏油路尚焉蓋柏油路爲世界各都市均認爲最適宜之築路材料如上海租界方面已將碎石路逐漸改爲柏油路面雖建築等需時用費較大而柏油路面之光滑尤易於打掃省維持費也故京滬二市所有新路俱以建築柏油路物爲準的對於舊有馬路亦均在日漸修築改舖柏油但柏油非中華出産槪購海外需用旣增滬巵尤大聞開　煤礦公司製造一種路磚專作造路之用不知此種路磚是否合用亦是一研究問題然爲挽回利權計則亦不妨採用而嘗試之也</p>
<p>收地給價　需用土地給以相當之地價此公允之辦法也上海一市對於收用土地餘給拆遷費外並依土地徵收法付給地價但同時並依不勞而得之增價徵收築路費京市建築中山路聞工程費約在七十萬元以上而拆遷費與土地費則又需數十萬元是以徵收土地因宜給以適當之地價而同時之應徵收築路費庶市民之權義平允聞杭州之漢口市廣州均照京滬之辦法云</p>
<p>交通信號　交通信號必點紅綠燈者紅以示止綠以示開此爲各國都市指揮車輛行人發普通之交通器具也上海租界以人口均增交通複雜故增設此項交通信號燈者極多先在公共租界裝置是燈後頗爲便利法租界亦起而裝設此無他蓋爲减免車輛計耳夫車輛肇禍勢所難免得有此燈覺稍减少惟在棋盤式之街道十字與三叉之路口方爲有用若係　曲無定之街道尚非必需故上海市府雖成立三載而少有裝設此種信號燈者以道路多彎曲也南京得中山路建築後交通故集中於是路市府當局爲謀交通之安全計亦裝設此種信號燈但係採用中國材料製成如故式橫燭光均甚弱小未免美中不足耳</p>
<p>電車汽車　電車須有軌道電線無軌電車無軌而有線公共汽車旣不須設置鐵軌又不用裝電線其汽車修理廠可大可小故則辦電車資本須雄厚規模須宏大創辦公共汽車不必極大之經費即遇更改路線時祇須出一公布即可將路線變更之上海租界與市區均有電車興公共汽車南京市早已創辦公共汽車至於電車尚在籌劃中但行駛電車其材料旣須購自歐美而設備又覺極其複雜行駛公共汽車雖覺輕而易舉則汽油一項又須仰給外國金錢外溢已難勝計上海市之電車公共汽車業除兩租界外有華商電車公司行駛於中華路民國路高昌廟十六舖等路其公共汽車有滬閔南拓汽車公司行駛於滬南至閔行一線有滬南公共汽車公司行駛於南市及閘北兩線祇以年來金磅飛漲汽車一項價又突增擬增加車資以資彌補無如有電車之先例在第一加增營業反受其影響吾以爲山西之汽油井最爲豐富尤宜設法開出俾供國内開辦汽車業者之用而挽回利權於萬一也</p>
<p>凡上所陳皆爲京滬二市路政中最重要者要之我國向鮮注意於路政自上海兩租界創始於前吾國人士始知路政之有關於文化交通者甚大故近幾年來城市鄉市均皆修築道路以期便利行駛汽車以捷往來無如路政問題談何容易以吾華科學之旣鮮發明實業之又不進展罔論柏油一項槪用舶來電車馬逹購自外洋而吾國徒以與築道路利便交通八字相號召不知於無形中轉爲外人多一獲利之機會推銷之淵藪興言及此能不痛心故我雖述京滬二市之路政以爲各地之借鏡實則一希望國内創設汽車製造廠二希望開掘山西省之汽車井三希望精研科學以自製電車馬逹四希望路面於柏油外尚有其他適當之築路材料否諒必有表同情於斯言者也</p>

After Yu Youren read the declaration, Chiang Kai-shek delivered closing remarks, saying, "Fellow comrades, today is the closing date of the fourth plenary session of the Third Central Executive Committee. All resolutions and declarations have been read. It is not necessary to mention them in the closing remarks, but Zhongzheng has a few ordinary words to say outside the declaration. We have held many plenary sessions before, and today we examine ourselves. Have all the previous resolutions been implemented one by one? We recall how much shame we have. Not only are we pained by the people of the country, but we are also laughed at by foreigners. We know that sitting and talking is not as good as getting up and doing. From now on, comrades of the Party Headquarters and the government should all abide by the resolutions and declarations and put them into practice. We should know that this time is a critical moment for whether the Three People's Principles of our Party can be implemented. All comrades must examine themselves at all times, otherwise the people's hopes for construction are high. Now that the warlords have been completely eliminated, if we do not rise up, how can we face the people and the Premier? To talk about revolution, we must revolutionize our hearts. Party members should examine themselves at all times to know their shortcomings and eliminate all previous problems. From now on, we will follow the resolutions and declarations to make the Three People's Principles a reality." This is what Zhongzheng has to offer to you at the closing of the meeting. Then the music was played, the ceremony was completed, and the photo session was dismissed.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Declaration of the Fourth Plenary Session <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>The declaration of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang was drafted by Chen Bulei and submitted to the Secretariat of the General Assembly. It was revised and passed at the eighth session on the afternoon of the 18th, and announced by Yu Youren at the closing ceremony. The full text is recorded below: For the past half year, all anti-revolutionary forces have united to carry out their final destruction. The most difficult task of our Party lies in suppressing the rebellion so as to achieve true national unification and peace. After months of struggle, the most stubborn reactionary forces obstructing China's unification were thoroughly destroyed, and the smooth road for the construction of the Three People's Principles was cleared of obstacles. The brave sacrifices and the concerted efforts of the people have ensured a solid foundation for the Republic of China. It is believed that from now on, those who follow the path of rebellion and oppose the Republic of China will disappear from the country. This is indeed recognized by the world and celebrated and inspired by the people of the country. The Central Executive Committee, at the time of the victory over the rebellion and on the anniversary of the Premier's birth, held the Fourth Plenary Session. It deeply believed that the Premier's birth was the beginning of the new life of our Chinese nation, and that the thorough success of eliminating obstacles this time was a great victory for the Three People's Principles. The future of the country has become a bright and promising new era. At this time when the whole country hopes for governance, the Plenary Session is all the more aware of the importance of its responsibilities. It has made a frank and undisguised examination of past work achievements, and it has also vowed to redouble its efforts to lead all Party comrades and compatriots across the country to earnestly complete the construction of the Three People's Principles and glorify it. The plenary meeting conducted detailed discussions on the major aspects of central government reorganization, local government reorganization, and party affairs, military affairs, economic affairs, and education, and made concise and essential resolutions. The following lists the ways to cooperate in the future as described to comrades and compatriots across the country: (1) Convene a National Assembly on a regular basis to establish the foundation for nation-building. The speedy opening of the National Assembly was entrusted by the Premier's will. Since unifying the country in the 17th year, our Party has never stopped thinking about practicing the Premier's will. It is concerned that on that day the revolution's appeasement was not thorough and the bad habits of warlord separatism still existed. A hasty meeting would inevitably involve borrowing military force, holding elections, buying politicians, and usurping public opinion to hinder the great plan of construction and disrupt the initial foundation of the country. In view of the past mistakes of the Yuan Dynasty, we cannot help but be cautious. Therefore, we must first hold a disbandment conference to ensure the actual elimination of the warlord system. Then there were successive rebellions by those who pretended to be revolutionaries, and the Central Government had no choice but to use troops to quell the chaos. Now that the reactionary warlords have been swept away, all politicians, bureaucrats, and feudal remnants have lost their support. Discipline has been restored, the atmosphere has been renewed, and there is an image of unified thought. The society has also achieved stability. Therefore, at this meeting, it was solemnly resolved to hold a National Assembly on May 5th of the 20th year, the anniversary of the Premier's assumption of the extraordinary presidency. All fundamental issues of nation-building will be sincerely presented to the people of the country, with the aim of unifying the minds of the people of the country and concentrating the strength of the people of the country to establish a foundation for the people, by the people, and for the people, and to clarify the responsibilities of our Party during its rule. The date of promulgation of the Constitution, which was previously stipulated in the Outline of Political Tutelage, will also be formally discussed and resolved by the National Assembly to determine the date when our Party will return power to the people and accelerate the early completion of the nation-building cause. The National Assembly convened this time is actually the beginning of the people's unanimous determination, determination, and joint acceptance of the Premier's legacy of building the Republic of China and striving to implement it. The Three People's Principles advocated by our Party are the Premier's elaborately created system, and they are also the only way to save and build the country. They cannot be attached to the examples of any country, nor can they be compared to any ideology or thought. The people of the country must unanimously, sincerely, and faithfully accept and strive to implement them before they can save the nation from danger and complete the construction of the country. This is the first thing we wish to convey to our compatriots across the country. (2) Concentrate talents to enrich the strength of nation-building. The Premier said, "If education is properly conducted, there will be no wasted talents; if encouragement is given in the right way, there will be no depressed scholars; if employment is properly managed, there will be no lucky adventurers." The sound development of any country depends on making the best use of its talents, assigning appropriate people to appropriate jobs, so that there is no idle person and no wasted task. In China today, when everything needs to be done, it is especially necessary to concentrate the wisdom of the country on the same goal and strive to achieve it. However, there are sighs everywhere in the construction of the country and society that talents are difficult to find. This may be because education is not properly conducted, encouragement is not given in the right way, and employment is not properly managed. Now that national unification has a solid foundation, selecting the virtuous and capable should enable each to fulfill their duties. The country should pay special attention to this. On the one hand, it is decided to pardon political prisoners, giving those who have temporarily gone astray an opportunity to reform. At the same time, corruption must be severely punished and the political path must be cleared, so that those with generous aspirations can be encouraged and willing to serve. From now on, the selection of talents will be based on ability and talent as the standard, but only if they obey our Party's ideology and platform and comply with the laws and regulations for selection and appointment will there be no more restrictions. This will enable all levels of politics to have clean and capable governments to preside over them, and all construction will be able to achieve sound development. Judging from the domestic and international environment of China, we cannot afford to delay the revolution and construction for a moment, and the country only has a small number of talents, so we cannot allow them to be idle and wasted. This is the second thing we wish to convey to our compatriots across the country. (3) Improve the system and refresh politics. Since the revolution, there has been considerable progress and special achievements in the military, but political reform has often failed to keep pace. There are various reasons for this, but the failure of the system to meet the actual needs, leading to the bad habits of waste and laxity, is the main reason for the low administrative efficiency. The Plenary Session conducted a thorough investigation of the actual work of politics in the past, believing that without correcting the system, there is no way to seek close connections; without reducing the number of agencies, there is no way to achieve the tension of work; and without governing with a neat and solemn spirit, there is no way to reverse the declining atmosphere and seek the completion of the political tutelage work within the prescribed time. Therefore, considerable modifications were made to the central system to enable the National Government to effectively supervise the personnel engaged in politics, each to strive for their work, to carry out the reality of revolutionary politics, and to live up to the expectations of the Party and the country. This is the third thing we wish to convey to our compatriots across the country. (4) Confirm that the eradication of communism and the suppression of bandits and military rehabilitation are urgent tasks of governance. The key to governance lies in considering the most pressing needs of the country and the people to determine the order of priority. The Plenary Session, in view of the rampant activities of communist bandits in various places in the past half year, is indeed the source of the people's acute pain. And with the frequency of years of conquest, domestic military affairs need to be reorganized and rehabilitated.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Turmoil in the American Banking Sector <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Recently, many European countries have experienced strikes, while the Americas have experienced turmoil in the banking sector. After the Mexican currency plummeted, most commercial firms reduced their operations to await the rescue of the silver market, but there is still no solution. Banks in various parts of the United States are now also causing public anxiety, so they are closing their doors one after another, which has had a great impact. In general, they are all affected by the decline of industry and the popularity of unemployment.</p>
<p>The organization of the American banking industry has always been unfavorable to large industries, and small banks are often divided, so the banking industry is not very developed. Later, banking laws were formulated to adapt to the interests of large industries, and then the American banking industry began to develop rapidly. In the past ten years, American industrial capital has suddenly gained dominance, and banking capital has naturally made similar progress. For a time, it was called the economic hegemon. Unexpectedly, in the midst of this vigorous development of large industries, it suddenly encountered this economic downturn. Trade stagnation and market depression have dealt a major blow to large industries, and the banking industry has naturally been affected. Therefore, today's turmoil is also expected. In today's world, the more developed a country's industry is, the more it is affected by world trends. After the failure of American large industries, its economic position in the world will inevitably change, and the banking industry, which is the key to it, cannot remain unchanged in this rapid trend. From this perspective, the source of this American banking turmoil is very far-reaching, and the impact caused by it will not be small, and it may not be possible to quell it in a short time.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Receiving Important Domestic Telegrams <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>It is also most urgent to determine the eradication of communism and the suppression of bandits as the primary urgent task of the National Government in the near future, and on the active side, to concentrate efforts to seek military rehabilitation. It is true that today, the first thing to do is to seek the stability of social order and the establishment of political order. If the scourge of bandits and communists is not eliminated, the people will all flee to escape death, and social order will rapidly collapse, leaving the country with irreparable disasters. And in the military aspect, with years of continuous warfare, military pay needs to be cleared, the number of personnel needs to be reorganized, the location of stationing needs to be designated, and war expenses need to be concluded. If it is not quickly restored to a peacetime state, all politics will not be able to stabilize and proceed. Only these two tasks must have the unanimous assistance of the people before they can be counted on a daily basis. This is the fourth thing we wish to convey to our compatriots across the country. (5) Relieving disaster victims and revitalizing industry. The first priority of nation-building is the people's livelihood. This is the Premier's most important and incisive legacy. The initial cause and final purpose of the revolution lie in this. Chinese economy has been backward for a hundred years. It has been subjected to the economic oppression of imperialists, and the people's lives have become increasingly impoverished. In addition, the country has suffered many misfortunes and frequent wars in the past twenty years. Man-made disasters and natural disasters have tormented the country, and deaths and displacements have spread across the country. The most tragic is the Guanzhong area in the northwest, the cultural center and natural treasury of resources since ancient times, which has been turned into a desolate ruin. In two years, the population has decreased by more than three million. Since unifying the country, the central government has focused its full efforts on disaster relief, recognizing this important task as the priority of all construction. However, the cruel and ignorant warlords, in order to achieve their ambition of separatism, turned to robbery, relief food, cut off transportation, betrayed the central government, and revived the scourge of war, causing the rogues and bandits to rely on this to肆益their rampant activities. After this year of war, deaths and displacements have become even more tragic. The Central Plenary Session believes that at this time of military victory and national settlement, it is the day to carry out the established policies. There are concrete resolutions regarding emergency relief and work relief, and there are general plans for the fundamental construction of forests, water conservancy, completion of the Longhai Railway, and immigration and reclamation. As for the people in other places who have suffered from natural disasters or man-made disasters, it is also sad to see them displaced. There are dozens of petitions. The Central Government accepts all the petitions of the people in various places and is willing to do its best to relieve their suffering. It has also resolved to implement the abolition of transit duties on January 1, 20th year of the Republic of China in order to reduce the burden on the people and eliminate decades of government shortcomings and seek the revitalization of industry and commerce. This is the sincere intention of the Central Government and an important decision of this session. This is the fifth thing we wish to convey to our compatriots across the country. (6) Complete local self-government, revise local divisions, establish a self-government system below the county level, and foster the self-governing capacity of local people. The Premier recognized this as the foundation for building the Republic of China and the starting point for the implementation of civil rights, and the political resolution of the Third National Congress designated it as the most important practical work. The Central Government, in accordance with the resolution, has done its best to promote it. However, during the military rise, the reactionary forces suppressed the provinces, which were troubled by their inability to implement the edicts. Most of the other provinces were affected by the rampant activities of bandits and communists. Only a few were able to complete the self-government organization on schedule, and the emptiness and desolation of the countryside have become the most common phenomenon. Therefore, the guiding principles for local administration in the future must also focus on stabilizing order and fostering the people's strength as the greatest tasks, and it is especially necessary to reward enthusiastic and honest people in the villages and towns so that they can devote themselves to public welfare to promote the completion of self-government organizations at all levels. At the same time, the Plenary Session also believes that the current provincial divisions cannot be revised and appropriately reduced in size, and the drawbacks of excessive provincial power cannot be eliminated, and the feudal bad habits cannot be broken to establish the foundation of the Republic of China. This resolution will be the largest administrative reform since the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, and it will have the most significant impact on the development of county self-government, the convenience of the Central Government's command of the locality, and the guarantee of national unification. Although the implementation methods of how to divide it still need to be studied in depth, it can be asserted that the realization of the Three People's Principles is tied to the soundness and enrichment of local self-government organizations. This is the core of the political tutelage work, and the whole country should not hesitate to make any sacrifices to achieve it. This is the sixth thing we wish to convey to our compatriots across the country. After the end of the counter-rebellion war, the great power of the Three People's Principles has been fully demonstrated, and the peaceful unification of the country has planted a deep and unshakeable foundation. The work of suppressing the rebellion by force has been declared successful. From now on, the greatest efforts of our comrades and the people of the country should be concentrated on the path of peaceful economic construction and cultural construction. This is the common will of the country and the basis for the rise and fall of the nation. The future development of the Republic of China and the work of revolutionary nation-building have opened a new era. There is a true saying that opportunities are difficult to obtain and easy to lose. Since the revolution, difficulties and hardships have not been encountered in one year alone, but today's environment is unprecedented. How should we exhaust our wisdom and loyalty to adapt to this great new opportunity? It is even more appropriate to have the united efforts of the country, to tighten those who are slack, to invigorate those who are decadent, to unite those who are scattered, to catch up and make up for those who are delayed, to be cautious and fearful to鞭策ourselves, and to be happy and excited to go to work. Looking ahead, the completion of a strong, prosperous, and happy Republic of China is awaiting us on the bright and splendid road ahead. The Premier's lifelong aspirations will achieve final success. Our comrades and compatriots across the country, let us invigorate our spirits, unite our hearts, work hard, and advance together to achieve great achievements. This declaration is respectfully made.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Directives to Party Headquarters at All Levels <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The Fourth Plenary Session issued a directive to party headquarters at all levels and all party members, stating: The mission of our Party lies in realizing the Three Principles of the People, as created by the late Premier. To truly achieve this great mission, all comrades in the Party must strive to enrich their intelligence, talent, and character to become models for society. At the same time, they must contribute their intelligence, talent, and character to the Party, so that our Party can use the great strength gathered from the collective intelligence, talent, and character of all party members to implement the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, the mission we bear should begin with the spirit of sacrificing oneself to benefit the people, and this spirit must be consistent from beginning to end. If this spirit declines or even disappears in individuals, they will inevitably fall behind; if it declines or disappears in the Party, it will inevitably fail. If this spirit grows stronger in individuals, life will be constantly renewed; if it grows stronger in the Party, success will be swift. The achievements of the Xinhai Revolution, the completion of the Northern Expedition in previous years, and the victories in repeatedly suppressing rebellions in the past two years are all the results of countless martyrs and patriots who aimed to serve. Those fake revolutionaries who aimed to seize power had no part in it. This council has inspected the past work of party headquarters at all levels and party members in various regions and discovered various errors, some of which are greatly contradictory to the revolutionary mission and consistent spirit of our Party. The total cause of all past errors is due to the improper use of the system, which accounts for a small part, and the unsoundness of the party members themselves, which accounts for a large part. Regarding errors due to the improper use of the system, this council has already made specific resolutions on the organization and work guidelines during this session. It is hoped that party headquarters at all levels will strictly abide by them and apply them appropriately in the future. Regarding errors due to the unsoundness of party members themselves, all our comrades in the Party must strive to strictly examine themselves and correct each other effectively. The biggest errors that party members themselves should correct can be summarized into three points: First, misunderstandings of the Party. Some party members often have not experienced the hardships of our Party's past creation, nor do they consider how arduous and far-reaching the future of revolutionary construction will be. They believe that the revolution has already succeeded and hope that our Party will be a source of income for their personal lives. With this delusion, their desires become more extravagant and their abilities diminish. If the Party assigns them responsibilities, they become very arrogant but do not work hard. If they have demands on the Party, they will become reactionary if they are slightly dissatisfied. After this rebellion suppression, this type of party member should already be an absolute minority, but their remaining habits still spread vaguely in various regions. In the future, our comrades in the Party should not only strictly prevent the invasion of these bad habits but also strive to eliminate the evil thought of relying on the Party for a living. Our Party alone has doctrines that can provide for all comrades in the Party, and all comrades in the Party should use their spare strength to provide for the entire Party, so that the foundation of party members supporting the Party is established both spiritually and materially, and they will not fall into the predicament of the Party supporting party members. Everyone must have this determination to sacrifice and this deep understanding. Only then can our Party become an irresistible revolutionary party. This is the first point. Second, misunderstandings of the Party headquarters. Observations of various aspects in the past have revealed that party members often mistakenly regard the local party headquarters and the government as opposing organs, while the people often mistakenly regard the party headquarters they rely on and admire as government offices of the same level. The malpractices caused by these two kinds of absurd views are truly unspeakable for us and should be deeply hated and thoroughly eliminated by our comrades in the Party. It must be understood that since our Party has made great sacrifices to obtain revolutionary power, the implementation of our Party's doctrines and the promotion of the Party's program and policies should be completely entrusted to the highest power organ of the Party. Repeated interference or even carping at everything is not permitted. We must use the highest power organ of the entire Party, which represents party headquarters at all levels, to supervise and urge the entire national government, which represents governments at all levels, to implement party rule in order to achieve the goal of consistent government orders. If each level of party headquarters is to supervise its corresponding level of government to implement party rule, it is tantamount to regarding party headquarters at all levels as independent political parties and using them to supervise governments at all levels to implement their own party rule, which is tantamount to regarding governments at all levels as separate governments. Wouldn't that be greatly mistaken? Therefore, party headquarters must never regard themselves as equal to government organs. Instead, they should strive to be an organized and capable central organization for the people. They must not tend to be in an opposing position to the government. Instead, they should strive to advance society as citizens and assist the government in realizing our Party's doctrines, program, and policies. This is the second point. Third, misunderstandings of the people. Party members in various regions often have improper remarks and actions, or even inherit the bad habit of treating the masses as tools. In essence, it is all due to not understanding that our Party should be the loyal servant of the people, resulting in the isolation of party members originally among the people from the people. The party headquarters closest to the local masses are isolated from society. It is not known that the greatest efforts of our comrades in the Party lie in going deep into the various undertakings and organizations of the people and society, using the enthusiasm to save people and the country, and using the character and ability to establish themselves and others to gain the trust of society and guide the people to strive for their own responsibilities that they should fulfill to society and the country. Only in this way can we be worthy of being party members of our Party. If we seek the effectiveness of the revolution, we must never allow party members to distinguish themselves from the people. Instead, we should make the people integrate with our Party's doctrines, so that the great cause of nation-building can be completed through the joint efforts of the people of the whole country as soon as possible. This is the third point. In summary, these three meanings should not only be deeply understood by our comrades in the Party in the future, but also be cautious and fearful in making sufficient self-cultivation in one's intelligence, talent, and character. We must strive to strictly abide by these three meanings and strive to practice them without fail. All my comrades, let us encourage each other. This is the order from the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang.</p>

<p>Important Domestic Telegrams Two</p>
<h3 id="e9">Proposal to Reduce Taxes on Domestic Goods <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Liu Zhi proposed a plan to reduce taxes on domestic goods to enrich the people's livelihood, stating: When investigating tax levies in our country, increasing current revenue is often the only purpose. There is often no deep consideration or long-term plan for the survival and development of industry and commerce. Although the income side is better when the tax amount is initially increased, after a while, merchants will hesitate and industries will close down, gradually leading to economic decline and difficulties for both the upper and lower classes. How can we expect the people to be rich and the country to be strong? It is important to know that if the country wants to increase tax revenue, it must first cultivate the tax source. If the tax source is abundant, the treasury will naturally be rich. The so-called "the people are rich, then the country is rich." The method of cultivation is to first reduce the burden on industry and commerce, so that the cost of domestic goods is low and easy to sell, which is sufficient to compete with foreign goods. The current regulations on machine-made goods stipulate that all machine-made foreign-style goods, when transported and sold domestically, are exempt from all other taxes and likin except for the export tax and inland tax collected by the first customs post. When they are transported and sold overseas, they are exempt from all taxes and likin. This kind of method not only reduces the cost of domestic industrial products, which is enough to resist foreign goods, but also can promote international trade. It cannot be said that it is not a good method for the government to protect industry and commerce. However, the industry and commerce in the inland provinces have always been immature. There are very few machine-made products, most of which are household handicrafts and agricultural products, which are not included in the preferential treatment of domestic goods. In addition, the years of war have made transportation difficult, the local areas are dilapidated, and the people are not living together. Those engaged in industry and commerce not only feel the lack of raw materials but also feel the stagnation of transportation. Furthermore, the heavy taxation increases the cost of goods and makes sales difficult. As a result, industry and commerce are declining day by day, and government revenue is also gradually decreasing. This is because the government only wants to increase tax revenue and does not consider whether merchants and the people have the ability to bear the burden, so the result is the opposite. Moreover, the government has clearly ordered the revitalization of industry and the promotion of domestic goods, which are unanimously agreed upon by the whole country as the primary plan to save the country. At this time when industry and commerce are budding, suddenly imposing heavy taxes is like heading north by driving the chariot south. It is proposed to appropriately reduce taxes on manufacturing goods and major agricultural products to show encouragement, so that although the tax amount is small, the quantity of goods will increase. Not only will the income not decrease, but it will certainly increase day by day. Its benefits to tax revenue are indeed not small.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Proposal to Implement the Allocation of Autonomous Funds <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Liu Zhi proposed a plan to implement the allocation of autonomous funds in order to prepare for local autonomy, stating: Local autonomy is the primary task during the period of political tutelage and is also the foundation of constitutional government. It is extremely important. If we want autonomy to be completed as scheduled, it is impossible to proceed without determining the funds in advance. The Third National Congress of our Party did not have time to discuss the resolutions on various cases. Regarding the second item of the first clause of the political category, temporarily allocate a part of the field tax collected from each county to be used as the autonomous funds for each county. The percentage is determined by the provincial government based on local conditions. The resolution was issued by the Central Executive Committee to the National Government to order the provinces to comply with it. Furthermore, the Second Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee resolved to complete the county autonomy case, with 19 years as the period for completing the county organization and the end of 23 years as the period for completing the county autonomy. In recent years, due to military influence, most provinces have not been able to implement it. Now that the period for completing the county organization has arrived, there are only four years left for completing the county autonomy. It is imperative to reaffirm the previous proposal and strictly order the provinces to comply with the above resolution and promptly allocate temporary and regular expenses for preparing for autonomy from the field tax of each county as special funds so that they can be carried out in stages in order to complete the work of political tutelage and establish the foundation of constitutional government.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Mo Dehui Protests to Karakhan <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of publishing remarks in a confusing manner, Nanjing diplomatic circles learned that Soviet Russian representative Karakhan sent a letter to our representative Mo Dehui at the Sino-Russian meeting, stating that when Karakhan met with Mo Dehui on the 6th of this month, Mo had expressed that he would resolve the issue of the Chinese Eastern Railway according to the Sino-Russian Agreement, the Fengtian Agreement, and the Bery Agreement. At the same time, Karakhan published the original letter before obtaining our consent. Mo has been ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest with Ka on the 17th. The original text said: At 11:00 PM on the 10th of this month, I received letter No. 93. After reading the full text in detail, there is a statement in which your representative stated to me during the conversation on November 6 that the status of the Chinese Eastern Railway should be restored according to the Sino-Russian Fengtian Agreement by the Bery Record. There must be no doubt about this point, and there can be no doubt about it. At 12:00 PM that night, I telegraphed to postpone the announcement and repeatedly stated to your representative that during the conversation on the 6th, because your representative talked about the status of the Chinese Eastern Railway, my representative said that the status of the Eastern Railway could not be completely in line with the Sino-Russian Fengtian Agreement. Your representative then said that what my representative said was tantamount to declaring that there was no guarantee for maintaining the restored status of the Eastern Railway. My representative then said to your representative that it was not against the restored status of the Eastern Railway, but it could not be insisted on maintaining the wording without any change. What should be done within the scope of the Sino-Russian Fengtian Agreement should still be carried out. However, the quotation in the letter is inconsistent with the truth of the conversation, and it was quoted and published without consent. My representative has no choice but to lodge a serious protest. As for what is stated in the letter, the current status of the Eastern Railway has not been changed without the consent of both parties. Before the current method of the Eastern Railway is changed or the Eastern Railway is redeemed by China, neither party should freely change it through unilateral actions. My representative can now declare that the current status of the Eastern Railway, which does not violate the provisions of the Sino-Russian Fengtian Agreement, should not be changed by either party before the current method of the Eastern Railway is changed or the Eastern Railway is redeemed by China without the consent of both parties. Based on the sincerity of past consultations, my representative sincerely hopes that the Sino-Soviet meeting that has already opened will continue to convene as soon as possible so that the actual work of this meeting can be carried out quickly and successfully in order to live up to the Chinese government's goal of increasing the friendship between the two nations of China and the Soviet Union and consolidating the good-neighborly relations between the two countries.

<p>Beiping At 9:00 AM on the 17th, the Beiping-Suiyuan westbound train was surrounded by more than 700 well-armed bandits at Guancun Station, 65 li from Pingdiquan. All the luggage was searched and 34 passengers and 3 railway staff, including the station master, were taken away. The station's cash was also robbed. The area belongs to the jurisdiction of the Jin army. The railway bureau telegraphed the Jin army to send the Eighth Cavalry Division to pursue them. On the 18th, 3 railway staff were released by the bandits, but one passenger was not released. Fortunately, there were no foreigners. The railway bureau has rushed to send the chief of the police department, Liang Hu, and Ding Wenqi to investigate the truth. Yu Xuezhong will postpone his trip to the Beiping-Hankou line due to the occurrence of this incident. There are many deserters and bandits in Chahar, and the Jin army is not serious about maintaining law and order and transportation. The Northeast Army will implement the advancement to the west of Tianzhen to take over the defense of the entire Beiping-Suiyuan Railway. Chairman Li Peiji has no power. Yan sent Zhao Chengshou to serve as the garrison commander. Guo Fengshan, the division commander originally stationed in Suiyuan, has fled. It is said that his subordinates, regiment commanders Mai Youchuan and Chen Yujia, were detained by Zhao and have been killed. The former provincial party committee member Ji Yifan and Chen Guoying were also arrested, and their life and death are unknown. Suiyuan has entered a world of terror.

<p>Beiping Yan telegraphed Xu Yongchang and Shang Zhen from Hebencun on the 16th, saying that from now on, all military and political affairs should be handled with full authority and there is no need to telegraph for instructions.

At present, the financial market has slightly turned around, and two and a half Shanxi dollars can be exchanged for one silver dollar. Zhao Daiwen lives with Yan in Hebencun and plans to go abroad together.

<p>Harbin On the 18th, the Board of Directors of the Chinese Eastern Railway held a meeting on personnel reduction and administrative reduction. Russia advocated reducing 17 offices of the railway bureau and 2,000 Chinese and Russian personnel, including 600 full-time staff. China advocated reducing 600 staff without moving full-time staff. The two sides debated fiercely. As a result, a small group was first formed to review the case. On the 18th, the Chinese directors of the railway bureau held a meeting and resolved to oppose the reduction of 2,000 personnel. It was suggested that the revenue of the Chinese Eastern Railway was decreasing day by day, with an average daily income of 120,000 rubles and an average daily expenditure of 200,000 rubles, resulting in increasing losses. The Chinese Eastern Railway borrowed 3 million from the bank in the past and signed 2 million with the Chinese Bank on the 17th and 1 million with the Russian Far East Bank. The direct wireless telegraph test from Harbin to Kucha was successful and will be launched next month. (Special telegram on the 18th)</p>

<p>Six-person presidium elected. Discussions ban eavesdropping. Indian representatives advocate for equal status, arguing that racial prejudice should no longer exist. Reuters, London, 17th. The second plenary session of the Indian Round Table Conference was opened today by British Prime Minister MacDonald, who delivered a speech urging the representatives to cooperate with each other and achieve success. The conference has decided to appoint MacDonald as chairman and Lord Sankey as vice-chairman, and to elect six people from the British representatives, Indian royal representatives, and British Indian representatives to form the presidium. It was also decided that news reporters would not be allowed to eavesdrop on the discussions, but the organizing committee would handle the release of news through the secretariat.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th. The six people elected by the plenary session of the Indian Round Table Conference to serve on the presidium of the committee were British representatives Lord Reading and Lord Peel, Indian royal representatives Prince Bikaner and Prince Bhopal, and British Indian representatives Aga Khan and Sastri. During today's plenary session, British Indian representative Sapru (one of those who traveled between India and Gandhi to mediate between the two sides) rose to speak, outlining the changes that had taken place in India over the past ten years and the seriousness of the non-violent resistance movement, saying that the so-called parliamentary sovereignty was nothing more than the sovereignty of a few people in Britain and a few people in India. Therefore, Indians naturally demanded freedom as an integral part of the British Empire. Ordinary people often asked what the slogan of "dominion status" commonly used by Indians meant, but they did not know whether these ordinary Englishmen had used these words to Canada in 1865, or to Australia in 1900, or to South Africa in 1909. India was determined to obtain equal status with other dominions. The Indian government must be responsible to the Legislative Council. He hoped that the Indian royal family would move forward with the idea of ​​a unified India. The various parts of India would manage their own affairs and be absolutely independent within their own borders, but would be subject to appropriate relationship adjustments with others. The real major issue in India today, in the opinion of the Indians, was the All-India Federation. In the past 25 years, the Indian Minister's mishandling of the continuous mass movements had caused a great mistake. As for the commercial level, the Indians did not want to seize the capital of the Europeans, and the Indians were willing to welcome any suggestions from the Europeans to protect their rights. The issue of national defense was indeed difficult, but the Indians only asked for the opportunity to train their own troops. The British army could be under the control of the Indian Governor, and the Indians could raise funds to pay for the military expenditure. If it was said that British officers were unwilling to serve under the command of the Indians, this was a big mistake. It must be known that the idea of ​​superior and inferior races should not exist, otherwise India would never be convinced. (Applause) Indian royal representative Prince Bikaner rose to speak, first declaring the loyalty of the Indian royal family to the British Emperor, and then said that the Indian royal states must be influenced by the development of political thought and external systems. However, India was a place with different situations. If a complete country was to be established and a sovereign parliament was to be placed in Delhi, which would make all the major and minor events of the people of India decided by this, it would be impossible. This kind of constitution would not leave any room for the Indian royal states, and this kind of government would be overwhelmed by its own weight. Therefore, he advocated the use of a federal system to combine the Indian royal states with British India, while the rights of the princes arising from the treaty must be more clearly defined. Any disputes concerning treaty rights should be tried by a superior court. British Indian representative Jayakar described the views of Indian youth and said that if India was allowed to enjoy dominion status today, the call for independence would naturally disappear within a few months.</p>

<p>Public uneasy. Associated Press, New York, 17th. According to today's news, several banks across the country have closed their doors one after another. Six banks in Lewis Town, Kentucky, two in Illinois, four in Missouri, one in Iowa, and thirty-five in Arkansas. The closure of these thirty-five banks was mostly due to public unease, as the difficulties in the banking sector in Connery had affected neighboring states. Several of these banks have been subject to runs, and some have used the law to suspend business for five days when subject to runs, in order to protect the interests of depositors. They may reopen within these days. At a time when the market is sluggish and unemployment is rampant, this banking crisis cannot be taken lightly.</p>

<p>Dissatisfaction with Shidehara from the Minseito Party. Secret strife between the Interior and Railway Ministers is intense. Hama guchi expected to be discharged from hospital in three weeks. Envoy Wang sends a telegram of condolence on behalf of the National Government. Dentsu, Tokyo, 18th. Although Prime Minister Hamaguchi's condition has improved, he is too old and will need a considerable amount of time to manage the affairs of the country. With the parliamentary session approaching and the government facing a busy autumn, there are concerns that it would be politically disadvantageous to appoint Foreign Minister Shidehara, who is from outside the party, as prime minister's deputy to preside over the parliament. There are voices of dissatisfaction within the Minseito Party. Foreign Minister Shidehara has also made it clear that he is only acting as a simple administrative deputy and hopes to reconsider the temporary prime minister's deputy with political significance before the parliament opens. If Prime Minister Hamaguchi's illness is prolonged, there may be a need to consider the qualifications of the next president of the Minseito Party and appoint a prime minister's deputy, or Prime Minister Hamaguchi may initiate a deliberation on the next president to seek a way to maintain the government.</p>
<p>Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 18th. The Minseito Party is indeed experiencing secret strife between the Adachi and Ekida factions due to Prime Minister Hamaguchi's assassination attempt. The party's executives have repeatedly held meetings to seek to ease the relationship between the two sides and have decided to hold another general affairs meeting on the 19th to advise both sides to act cautiously and stop all disputes.</p>
<p>Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 18th. The results after Prime Minister Hamaguchi's surgery in the hospital have been very good. According to medical experts, he will be fully recovered and discharged from the hospital in a week. If he rests further, he will be able to recover his health by the time the parliamentary session resumes next year and stand at the forefront of the parliament.</p>
<p>Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 18th. Envoy Wang Rongbao visited the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 15th to express his sincere condolences for Prime Minister Hamaguchi's accident.

<p>National Press Agency, London, 18th. The Daily Express today published an article by Mussolini, the full text of which concerned the future of peace in Europe and the reasons for its current unrest. It stated that many people were dissatisfied with the Treaty of Versailles and were unanimously demanding that the treaty be amended as soon as possible. He strongly advocated for universal disarmament. Although the European countries did not stop their military preparations for one day, Italy would not abandon its arms race. What person among us does not hope for the realization of peace, but we cannot therefore sit idle and abandon national defense in order to protect the integrity of our territory. May Heaven send punishment on anyone who invades the borders of Italy. If Italy is forced to enter a war, it will do its utmost to defeat the enemy.</p>

<p>Reuters, Manila, 17th. Those who advocate for Philippine independence are now engaged in internal strife.

<p>Reuters, London, 17th. When the House of Commons debated the Palestine issue today, George of the Liberal Party said that the Liberal Party wanted the Jews and Arabs to each have half of the colony. Undersecretary Hills said that the government's claim to not comply with the terms of the trusteeship was a misunderstanding. The government not only did not violate the terms of the trusteeship but also wanted to implement it. The government regarded the Arabs and Jews as equally important and repeatedly wanted both parties to have the opportunity to state their opinions before adopting legislative and administrative actions in the future. The development plan for Palestine, which requires 2.5 million pounds, will be sponsored by the British government to provide loans. This plan will allow about 10,000 Jews and Arabs to be resettled in Palestine each year. The government will submit this plan to the British Parliament after Christmas. As for the proposal to hold a round table conference as soon as possible, it must be known that it has never been possible to bring all parties together in the past.</p>

<p>Simultaneously Carrying Out the Pacification of Zhang Gui's Remnant Troops. Guangzhou Correspondence: The Battle of Nanning has been fluctuating between tense and relaxed for days. In terms of the situation, it has become tense again in recent days. The Eighth Route Army Headquarters hired a total of 320 small steamships in Wuzhou starting from the 7th. On the same day, it hired 12 electric boats and about 30 lighters in Guangzhou, which sailed to Wuzhou on the 8th. At present, it is estimated that there are more than 30 shallow-water steamships distributed to the Guiping area and more than 50 to the Guixian area. The Department of a certain brigade stationed in Zhaoqing has reportedly opened Wuzhou in order to transfer the 63rd Division stationed between Tengmeng to the left wing for reconnaissance. According to recent reports, the remnant enemy Zhang Gui's army has suddenly shifted its focus to Nanning and seems to be abandoning Liushu. Li Zongren's troops have moved and fled to Zhujiang, Bai Chongxi's troops have moved to Shanglin and Wuming, and Zhang Fakui's troops, Xue Yue, Huang Heling, and other troops are stationed in the east of Nanning City. In summary, the enemy seems to be focusing on the Yongchun and Hengxian areas from three routes. Therefore, the Eighth Route Army has also increased the transfer of the entire 63rd Division, Li Yangjing, to Guixian, and the 126th Brigade, Huang Zhiwen, has already opened to the front line of Guixian. The 125th Brigade, Huang Yanzhen, is also continuing to be transferred. Division Commander Li Yangjing, together with 125th Brigade Commander Huang Yanzhen and more than ten attendants and orderlies, took the Zhixin ship to Guixian on the evening of the 7th to supervise the attack on Yongning, and agreed with the 10th Route Army, Lu Han, to return to Pingma and attack Yongning together. The air force team was also deployed to cooperate in bombing the enemy with fierce bombs at that time. All the planes that set off to attack Yongning were temporarily handed over to Captain Hu Jinya for command. In this overall voice, there are also simultaneous rumors of pacifying the enemy army. It is said that with regard to Zhang Fakui's army, the former commander of the 12th Division of Zhang's army, Mr. Miao, was appointed as the general chief of staff of the headquarters. After Miao was appointed, he took office at the Eighth Route Army Camp in Wuzhou on the 8th. Regarding the recent collection of the Guizhou army, Ma Xiaojun has also been active. Ma was an old figure in the Guizhou army. In March of this year, he was once entrusted by the Central Government to carry out the pacification of the Guizhou army. At that time, the war in the north was intensifying, and the Guizhou army had no intention of surrendering. Now that Yan and Feng have fallen, it is difficult for the Guizhou army to survive for a long time, so Ma was again ordered to recruit. After Ma arrived in Wuzhou, he sent his former subordinate, Mr. Wei from Rong County (a relative of Wei Yunsong of the Guizhou army), to Nanning to negotiate everything first, and then reported it to the Central Government after the negotiations were completed. A telegram was sent by Ma to the generals of the Guizhou army, advising them to disarm, saying that the authorities could agree to give them a title to go abroad for two years and then allow them to return to the country and be given priority use. The following is a transcript of Ma's telegram: (Nanning deeply sends greetings to brothers Bai Jiansheng, Li Delin, and Huang Jikuan. After Feng and Yan's defeat, the Central Plains have been settled. The situation in Guizhou should be peaceful. If the brothers are willing to disarm and go abroad, the Central Government can organize a study tour and give each of them 50,000 yuan for travel expenses. After two years of returning to the country, they will be given priority use and their previous merits will not be forgotten. As for the reorganization of the troops and the proper handling of the aftermath, there are appropriate measures to be taken in person. At this point in time, it is time to stop. Prolonged fighting is useless and only harmful. Even if the brothers are willing to starve to death in the Western Mountains, they should also think of the descendants of Zhou Li. I have come today to seek mediation. If you agree, please telegraph to the Central Government for approval, or if you need to come in person to discuss, it is possible. How will the blessings and misfortunes be transferred in one thought? I hope for a quick reply. Ma Xiaojun bows) (November 11)</p>

<p>Hankou Dispatch: Since the Wuhan Military Headquarters issued an order on the 1st of this month for Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces to simultaneously suppress bandit communists, the mobilization of various bandit suppression troops by land and water has been vigorous. It is reported that the troops transferred back from the front include Xia Douyin's 13th Division, Zhi Zhi's 44th Division, Xu Yuanquan's 48th Division, Jiang Guangnai's 61st Division, Cai Tingkai's 60th Division, Chen Cheng's 11th Division, and the brigades of Liu Peixu, Rong Jingfang, and Xu Dezhao. Commander Xia's troops arrived first and stationed part of their force in Huangpi and Xiaogan in northern Hubei, responsible for guarding the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, while another part proceeded to eastern Hubei. The three divisions of Xu, Jiang, and Cai arrived successively, with Xu's division temporarily stationed in Wuhan and Jiang's and Cai's divisions heading to Hunan to then transfer to Jiangxi. Commander Chen's division has already arrived, with a part of Xiao's division moving last. It is reported that Xu's and Xiao's divisions and Liu's and Xu's brigades were originally under the command of Xu Yuanquan, the 16th Route Army Commander, with the area west of Hubei designated as their garrison area. Except for Xiao's division, which will be concentrated in Luoyang and move south today (the 17th), the remaining troops have completely arrived in Hankou. Yesterday, the 144th Brigade of Xu's division was ordered to proceed to Jingzhou and Shashi, and Liu Peixu's brigade also continued to set out today. It is expected that they will be fully deployed within three days.

Brigade Commander Dai Ji will lead the 9th Brigade and the division headquarters to depart tomorrow. The transportation of this route army has now been completed. Chen Cheng's 11th Division was originally stationed in the Xinyang area, but due to a lack of vehicles, it could not be deployed as scheduled. Now that the southern section of the Pinghan Railway is fully open, it began moving south yesterday. Its first batch has already arrived in Hankou. The special service battalion, artillery battalion, and the military law and military supply departments have also arrived. The 33rd Brigade will continue to advance, with the 31st Brigade moving last. After arriving in Hankou, the division will station the 33rd Brigade in Qiaokou, the 33rd Brigade in Liujiamiao, and the 31st Brigade in Yuezhou, responsible for guarding the Wuchang-Changsha Railway line.

<h3 id="e67">Progress of Bandit Suppression in Hubei Province <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Bandit communists in Hubei Province have always been rampant, but still less so than in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces. Therefore, the authorities' bandit suppression plan prioritized Jiangxi, then Hunan, and finally Hubei. Recently, the two groups of He Long and Kuang Jixun attempted to attack Jinshi and Fengxian but failed, and then turned to attack Gongan, Shishou, Jianli, and other counties in southern Hubei, which were successively captured. At the same time, red bandits in northern Hubei also gathered in the northern countryside of Huangpi, echoing the bandits in southern Hubei from afar. The military situation of bandit suppression in Hubei Province had to become tense. Currently, the bandit communists in Huangpi have been defeated by Xia Douyin's and Xu Yuanquan's forces. The authorities have also dispatched a large army to search and suppress the bandits in southern Hubei. It is expected that they can be eliminated in about ten days. The situation of bandit suppression on each route is described separately below:</p>
<p>In Northern Hubei: Huangpi in northern Hubei is the thoroughfare of the Pinghan Railway. Although bandit communists are often found, there are at most only over a thousand. They are quickly pacified after the garrison troops rush to suppress them. On the 15th of this month, suddenly about ten thousand communist bandits surrounded Yaojiaji in the northern countryside of the county. The 75th Regiment of the 13th Division was originally stationed there. Because of the large number of bandits, they relied on the terrain and held fast. The bandits launched a brave assault, and the fighting was fierce. The regiment used machine guns to sweep them, and they retreated slightly, but the encirclement remained. After the regiment telegraphed Hankou for help, the Military Headquarters immediately ordered the 48th Division to dispatch two regiments to provide assistance and ordered Xu Yuanquan, Commander of the 16th Route Army, to personally command. After receiving the order, Xu led the replenishment regiments one and two of that division to rush there overnight. Xu personally supervised the battle, and the besieged troops of the 13th Division launched a pincer attack from inside and outside, finally defeating the bandit troops. Xu returned to Hankou on the 16th, while replenishment regiments one and two remained there temporarily to cooperate with the troops of the 13th Division to eliminate the remaining bandits. The bandit communists in Guanghua and other places are also very rampant and have been defeated by Fan Shisheng's troops of the 51st Division, fleeing into Henan Province.</p>
<p>In Southern Hubei: Honghu in southern Hubei has always been a communist stronghold. The pseudo-Hubei Provincial Party Department and the Soviet government are located there, and He Long, Kuang Jixun, Yun Daiying, and others are in charge. After repeated pursuits and suppressions by officers and soldiers, they have not been eliminated. Recently, He's bandits entered Hunan and attacked Jinshi and Fengxian but failed, and then turned back to southern Hubei, successively capturing Shishou, Jianli, and Gongan counties, and their momentum is very strong. In order to thoroughly resolve the bandit communists in that area, the authorities have drafted a plan and designated Xu Yuanquan's 48th Division, a part of Xiao Zhichu's 44th Division, a part of the 3rd Training Division, and the three brigades of Liu Peixu, Rong Jingfang, and Xu Dezhao to surround and suppress them, with Xu Yuanquan in charge of the command. Currently, a part of Xu's division has moved to Shashi, Liu Peixu's brigade has moved to Jianli, Xu Dezhao's brigade has moved to Xiantao, and Rong Jingfang's brigade has moved to Yuekou, forming a large encirclement towards Honghu. Xu's headquarters will be located in Shashi to facilitate command. Xu himself will personally supervise the suppression after each unit has fully arrived at the designated location. In addition, the bandit disaster in eastern Hubei is most serious in Huangmei, Guangji, Qichun, and other counties. Currently, the troops of the 13th Division are suppressing them, and most of the bandit troops have fled to the border of Anhui and Jiangxi. If no major forces join them, they should be able to be eliminated within ten days. (November 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e68">He Jian's Resignation Not Approved <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: He Jian, Chairman of the Provincial Government and Commander of the 4th Route Army, has been under heavy attack by people inside and outside Hunan. In addition, the bandit situation is rampant, and military salaries are exhausted. The environment is difficult to cope with. Therefore, on the 10th of this month, he telegraphed the central government, strongly resigning from all his positions. After the telegram was sent, it was kept strictly confidential, fearing that military morale would be shaken once the news spread. On the 13th, he received a reply telegram from Chairman Chiang, expressing warm words of consolation and retention, and then the telegram was made public. It is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>He Jian's Telegram of Resignation: I, your subordinate, was ordered to be in charge of Hunan's administration and to command the military affairs of the Fourth Route Army, as well as to handle the suppression of bandits, while also being responsible for guiding the party affairs of Hunan Province. Since taking office, I have been diligent day and night, fearing that I would not be up to the heavy responsibilities and that my efforts to govern would be ineffective, failing to live up to the great trust placed in me. Fortunately, I have followed your strategies in all matters and have worked hard to carry them out without any obstacles. Unexpectedly, within a few months, incidents have occurred one after another, with the Gui rebels and communist bandits successively fleeing to the provincial capital. I was filled with shame and anger. Although I relied on your virtue and power to recover quickly, I deeply regret that I was unable to eliminate the threat beforehand. I intend to resign immediately to give way to more capable people. At this time, the central government is using troops in Henan and Shandong, and the communist bandits have gathered in Pingxiang and Liuyang. Zhu Mao and Peng Huang, under the orders of the Third International, have united the mob and are trying their best to invade Hunan, attempting to advance into Wuhan and seize the political power of five provinces to implement a total national rebellion plan. Moreover, the remnants of the Gui and Zhang rebels are still entrenched in the area of Qiyang, Lingling, Dong'an, and Wugang, and the bandit atmosphere is rampant. The situation is tense, and I dare not rashly push aside my responsibilities, lest I be taken advantage of by the rebels and cause harm to the overall situation. I had to telegraph for instructions and continue to perform my duties, trying my best to remedy the situation. Now that Yan and Feng have been resolved, and Gui and Zhang are about to be destroyed, although the communist bandits are still active in the border areas of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, the central government has decided on an encirclement and suppression plan, and it will not be difficult to quickly pacify them. Military affairs are gradually coming to an end, and construction is urgently needed. I have always admired your knowledge and have served my hometown for many years, bearing heavy responsibilities. I am grateful for your kindness and will wholeheartedly devote myself to serving, not shying away from difficulties and dangers, and striving to repay you. However, my talent and wisdom are short, and I am not familiar with the opportunity to handle difficult Hunan issues. I have been laboring in vain and have not benefited the people. I have exhausted my strength and have not benefited the country. I have not made any contributions in the past, and I am even more fearful of walking on thin ice in the future. Therefore, I sincerely plead that I may be allowed to resign from all my positions and that someone be appointed to replace me immediately so that I may have the leisure to retire and devote myself to learning. In the future, I will serve the party and the country for a longer period of time. If I have any wisdom, I will still try to contribute it at any time. I respectfully submit this telegram and pray that you will examine it and give instructions to follow. Your subordinate, He Jian, kowtows.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's Reply Telegram to Changsha Commander He Yunqiao: I have received your telegram with respect.

<h3 id="e69">Jinan Telephone Company Appeal Case <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The Part Regarding Provisional Execution Has Been Heard. Jinan Dispatch: In the case of the debt between the Jinan Telephone Company and the Japanese Dongtuo Corporation, the Jinan Local Court previously ruled that the Telephone Company should repay Dongtuo 1.2 million yuan and ordered provisional execution. The Telephone Company appealed to the High Court to revoke the provisional execution, while the other party asked the Local Court to extend the provisional execution for one month. The court ruled that the provisional execution be extended for 20 days from November 1st. If the Telephone Company could not fulfill its debt obligation by the deadline, the provisional execution would be enforced. After the appeal of the provisional execution, the Shandong High Court scheduled a hearing for today (the 15th). The lawyer for the appellee, the Dongtuo Corporation, Japanese national Yoshida, requested a temporary leave, which was rejected by the court. The hearing began at 2:00 PM today. Because the provisional execution had already been ruled, it could only be canceled by a judgment. Therefore, a collegiate panel was formed. Those who appeared in court were the Presiding Judge of the High Court, Gan Jianshu, Judge Yi Xinding, Judge Yikui, and the agent lawyer of the Telephone Company, Yan Chenghan and Jia Rongqing. The court first asked the appellant for the reasons for requesting the revocation of the provisional execution, and Yan Chenghan argued according to law. The court also asked about the business situation of the Telephone Company. Yan replied that in the 14th year of the Republic, there were only 2,100 telephone lines in the city, and now it has increased to 2,615. The court then announced the end of the debate and scheduled the judgment for the 17th.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Ministry of Education Issues Senior High School Commercial Course Curriculum <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Education issued an order to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities regarding the temporary standards for the senior high school commercial course curriculum. The original order stated: "The temporary standards for various courses in kindergartens, primary schools, junior high schools, and senior high school general studies, as formulated by the Ministry, have already been issued. Now, the temporary standards for the senior high school commercial course curriculum have also been printed. In addition to distributing them separately, we are sending two copies of this order for your department to forward to the senior high school commercial schools under your jurisdiction. If there are insufficient copies, please purchase them directly from bookstores selling these standards. Please also instruct the schools under your jurisdiction to conduct practical experiments accordingly and submit the results of the experiments and research to the Ministry for review."</p>
<p>Explanation of the Temporary Standards for Senior High School Commercial Courses: The curriculum standards were compiled by the drafting committee for the senior high school commercial course curriculum of the Ministry of Education, printed and distributed by the Zhonghua Book Company, priced at 30 cents. The explanation of the book is described in five points as follows: (1) The process before the formulation of this standard is mostly similar to the temporary standards for kindergarten, primary school, junior high school, and senior high school general studies curricula, which have been detailed in the beginning of the compilation of primary and secondary school curriculum standards and the explanations of various established curriculum temporary standards. However, this standard relies more on the efforts of various experts, so it was not finalized and sent to print until August of the nineteenth year. (2) The drafting of this standard first formulated a general table as a basis for the drafting of each subject, but the general table also underwent multiple revisions. After the drafting of each subject was completed, it was revised once as a whole (the general table is detailed in the original book). (3) The Party Ideology course can use the same standard as the general studies course and should be formulated by the Central Party Headquarters. Military training and world geography also use the same standards as the general studies course. Military training has separate regulations, and world geography is detailed in the temporary standards for the general studies course. The subjects in the general elective course can adopt the standards of each subject in the general studies course and increase or decrease the content according to the credits.

<p>Since the establishment of the Jiangsu Province Compulsory Education Joint Office, it has successively hired Wu Zhihui, Zhu Jingnong, Meng Xiancheng, Zheng Xiaocang, Yu Zhonghuan, Gu Yinting, Liu Zhanen, Wang Diancun, Jiang Wenyu, Gu Shuzhi, Wang Yunwu, Yuan Guanlan, and others as guidance committee members. The committee members have made many plans for the progress of the office's work and have devoted their efforts to guidance, achieving remarkable results. Now, with the death of Yuan Guanlan due to illness, the office lacks a guide, and in recent years, the work has been expanding day by day. In addition to the active progress of the Local Education Monthly, the second session of teacher training correspondence, other tasks such as the popularization of education experimental areas, compulsory education surveys and statistics, and dispatching personnel to conduct investigations are being undertaken. It is necessary to rely on the virtuous to assist. Therefore, Qin Jingyang, the former director of the General Education Department of Central University, has been re-hired as a guidance committee member to provide guidance. Now, Mr. Qin has replied that he is willing to take on the responsibility. It is expected that the office's work will be guided by many great educators and will become better and better.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Tongwen Chinese Students Strike <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Tongwen College in Xujiahui, Shanghai, which was established by the Japanese, also enrolls Chinese students and is divided into two departments: the main department and the Chinese department. Few people pay attention to it. Recently, due to excessive oppression of the Chinese department, a strike has been triggered. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Initially, the Republican Daily published an article about the corruption of Tongwen College. The school authorities suspected that Wang Zhaogan and Guo Qimeng, two first-year students of the department, were responsible. Suddenly, on November 8, they received a notice from the school summoning them for a conversation, forcing them to withdraw from the school, and filling out the withdrawal application and stamping it on their behalf. The students were very angry when they heard about it. The student union raised questions and asked the school to announce the reasons for the expulsion and their crimes. The school authorities replied that there was no need to announce the reasons, and showed the withdrawal application filled out on behalf of the two students, saying that it was not an expulsion. After repeated negotiations, they were asked to withdraw the order. The school authorities knew that they were at a disadvantage and their means were despicable, so they tried to find a declaration of the Academic Research Association commemorating the October Revolution and falsely accused the two students of issuing it. The student union said that the school arbitrarily took a declaration from an off-campus organization, which was not enough to prove that the two students' actions were detrimental to the personal future of the two students, and asked the school to provide evidence. The school authorities refused strongly, saying (the school's decision to expel has been made, whether or not it was done by these two students, the student union has no right to interfere). Japanese imperialism is so contemptuous of Chinese students, which is also an insult to the Chinese nation. The student union could no longer tolerate it, so it convened a general meeting of all students last night (the 17th) and decided to strike together on the 18th and put forward seven conditions, demanding a satisfactory response from the school authorities, vowing not to resume classes until victory. The Japanese students in the headquarters also protested against the school's improper handling of the matter and took the same action as the Chinese students, with the right to initiate a strike.</p>

<p>Detained Representative Released Yesterday: The student unrest at China Public School has been going on for three weeks. Zhang Yaoguang, a student representative of the school, was detained by the Public Security Bureau for this matter for ten days. Yesterday, Director Yuan Wenqin found out that there were no other relations and restored his freedom. It is also reported that the school's board of directors, in view of the increasing student unrest, which is not a blessing for the school, is said to be planning to convene a meeting of all directors behind the scenes of the Fourth Plenary Session after Cai Zimin, Yu Youren, and others return to Shanghai to discuss and seek relief measures. The students of the school are also preparing to submit written opinions and other items so that they can be submitted at that time to save the movement so that it can be resolved satisfactorily.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Declaration of All Students of the Labor and Agricultural College <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>National Labor University Agricultural College All Students Declaration on Su Rugan, Fang Cheng, etc. Accusation of Students:</p>
<p>If the personality of all the youth of a college is innocently accused, even if one has the power to cover the sky with one hand, where will the justice of the world exist? Even if justice is unfortunately lost, if public opinion is still there, it is difficult to conceal the injustice of our generation. The facts are presented to the people of our country. Since the turmoil in our school, we have already issued a declaration for criticism from people of all walks of life. Recently, Su Rugan, Fang Cheng, and others have falsely accused all the actions of the students in their letter to President Li, saying that they were all instructed by President Li personally. It should be known that the opposition of the students to the school affairs meeting and the expulsion of Chen, Fang, Wu, and Jin are our own initiative. The second declaration on November 11 can be used as a reference. The content of the letter, except for matters related to the president's personal affairs, does not ask, but there are many that involve our character and insult the actions of the students, such as (All those in the student declaration should also be fully available in the letter, which is tantamount to confessing that the master of this student unrest is Mr. himself), etc., as if (the declaration) cannot be consistent with (the letter), and the opinions must be different from the president. If the facts coincide, the inside story will be revealed. What kind of bizarre method of proof has ever been found after searching the logic? How can it be reasonable to erase the truth? The declaration of our people has its own fair attitude, and the (letter) of the president has its own claims. How can they be confused? It was found that the declaration of students of the Workers' and Peasants' Colleges on October 31 opposed Li Lianggong as the president. Today, the letter from Mr. Su Fang and others to the president also expressed this attitude without prior consultation. If this is used to accuse the gentlemen of being our running dogs, even if the words are as good as Su Fang's, etc., how will they answer? Furthermore, the expulsion of Chen from the Horticulture Department and the expulsion of Fang Wu from the Agronomy and Chemistry Department are also indiscriminately and forcibly referred to as Li's instigation. Alas, the light of a word, where does the personality of the youth of a dignified university exist? It is also a good job to trap people in injustice. Things must rot before insects are born. The three gentlemen Chen, Fang, and Wu do not reflect on their own faults, but shamelessly use indiscriminate words to confuse the hearing and make people feel ashamed, then the expelled should have no place to stand. If the world has truth, then the absurd people should have something to wake up with. Here are the details (1) The expulsion of Chen from the Horticulture Department was due to the student's own initiative. The second declaration has already detailed it. And Chen then secretly fought with Zhang Nong, the director of the farm, for whether or not the horticultural area was independent in the management of the farm, causing suspicion. At this time, Chen then spoke to the students, saying that the students in Hunan were driven by people, so they advocated opposing him (Zhang Nong is from Hunan). He then proposed to the president that the horticultural area be separated from the farm and requested the resignation of Zhang Nong. Now that Zhang Chen is cooperating, the slogan of Hunan students being driven by people is no longer suitable for opposing Li Lianggong. Therefore, the expulsion of Chen by the students of the Horticulture Department has changed to Li Lianggong's presiding. The humble handwriting of arbitrarily accusing the student's claims of being instigated by one party to cope with private struggles, is there anything more than this in the world? (2) The expulsion of Fang Wu from the Agronomy and Chemistry Department also has its own bright and upright motives, not only because they opposed the hiring of a professor of soil science, but also because the motives of the two gentlemen Fang Wu were not pure, and the handwriting was even more despicable. They only used personal feelings to exclude dissidents and jointly wrote to the president to threaten their resignation, deceiving the students and disregarding the public interest. There is nothing more than this (to be continued)</p>

<p>Team Wins Rowing...32 to 22 Tong Wen Wins Nan Feng...24 to 17</p>
<p>The West Qing Basketball Association only held two Group B matches last night, starting at 7:50 PM. The two teams were evenly matched and competed fiercely, greatly exciting the audience.

Yesterday's battle report is as follows:</p>
<p>Team Wins Rowing</p>
<p>Rowing opened the scoring first, but the Team later took the lead, with a fairly good offensive strategy, once leading 16 to 2. They then scored 20 points. The four Rowing team players, Na Xian, successfully made two free throws, scoring four points. The first half ended with the Team leading 23 to 8. In the second half, Rowing launched a strong counterattack, scoring repeatedly and gaining momentum. The Team was on the verge of collapse, making the score 23 to 18 and 24 to 20. Although the Team was still leading by four or five points, they were in a precarious situation. They then rallied their spirits and persevered. Hu Zhikang and Yu Zhong successively scored, resulting in the Team winning the Rowing team 32 to 22. Referee: Wan Fu. The scores are as follows:</p>

<p>B: I'm not afraid of anything else, I'm most afraid of seasickness, so I dare not marry.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Snippets from a Press Conference and Social Gathering <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiping</p>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists Association held its autumn social gathering on the 16th at the Tongxing Restaurant. The weather was fine and the sky was clear on that day. Members were all in high spirits and came together, some with their families. There were also guests attending, including some who had come from Kyoto from afar. In total, there were more than 130 people, a scale unprecedented in the past. I heard many anecdotes and would like to share one or two with readers.</p>
<p>Journalists should fulfill their duties</p>
<p>During the event, Committee Member Ge Gongzhen was elected as chairman. He reported on the association's affairs, first welcoming the guests and the assembled members. He then said that the association's publication, "The Journalist Weekly," had been published to its 27th issue, specializing in the status quo of the newspaper industry at home and abroad, which had been greatly loved by all sectors. He said that they were planning to improve the editing and increase the length of the article to spread it more widely. The association planned to raise funds to build a clubhouse to meet the needs of members' after-work entertainment. He also described the assistance given to Zhang Sixu and others this summer, as well as the death of Mr. Xie Jieshi, the founder of the association, and called on colleagues to stand in silence to mourn. The crowd then stood and silently mourned for two minutes. He continued by saying that in recent times, unification had been completed and the national fortune was on the rise. Freedom of speech had been declared, and the Fourth Plenary Session had resolved to convene a National Assembly on May 5th of next year. All colleagues should uphold the duty of journalists, serve the party and the country, and do their best for the people, so that the contribution of newspapers to the country and society would be even greater, in order to realize the ideal of a new China. Finally, he thanked more than 40 domestic goods factories for their generous gifts.</p>
<p>Resembling a temporary stage</p>
<p>Halfway through the dinner, the chairman invited members to perform, but some were reluctant while others volunteered. Then the guests, Mr. Wang Qingxun and Mr. Liu Yin, performed harmonica solos and duets. Mr. Wang said that the harmonica can play all kinds of music, each instrument costs only two or three yuan and can be learned in a few days. It is the wonder of family music. Compared to the violin, piano, brass music, etc., which cost hundreds of dollars and take two or three years to learn, it is like heaven and earth. He is planning to start the Chinese Harmonica Association to popularize it. Then, members Qian Ruifu, He Xiya, Feng Zhaoliang, Yu Kongwo, and Hang Shijun performed Peking Opera songs, with Yu Kongwo and Wang Ruoqi playing the piano. The singing of the old man, the old student, the female, and the blue shirt interspersed, bringing refreshing and pleasant emotions. After a song ended, the shouts of "Bravo...Bravo" and "One more" shook the house. The singers responded to the audience's request with one song after another, and only stopped after an hour. Other members wanted to continue the performance, but due to time constraints, they had to wait for another day. No wonder guests praised the talents of the press.</p>
<p>Fun facts from the event</p>
<p>A long table was placed in the restaurant, displaying gifts, including all kinds of clothing, food, and daily necessities. A gentleman laughed and said to me, "If this is moved to Nanjing Road to set up a tobacco and paper store, it would be enough to meet the needs of customers." Another gentleman said, "There are so many people here today. If a psychological test were conducted, the results would show that 60-70% of them came to divide the spoils." These are truly interesting words. The clothes and hats of the people attending the meeting were scattered all over a room, occupying more than enough space. The number of accumulated goods can be imagined. The restaurant was too large. When the chairman reported, the audience could not distinguish between each other, so he asked them to stand on the high platform and shout loudly. After speaking, he was exhausted and hoarse. There were quite a few female comrades who were good at singing, but most women were shy and did not perform. A certain lady suddenly left temporarily before singing, and only came back to receive the prize, which can be said to be good at advancing and retreating.</p>
<p>Everyone was happy after the banquet</p>
<p>After the banquet, gift vouchers were distributed. The vouchers were sealed in envelopes, each guest received one and each member received three. Those who received good prizes shouted with joy and were overjoyed. Those who did not receive a prize or received a consolation prize were disappointed. The consolation prize was inscribed with "I wish you good luck in the future," which was quite inspiring. The gifts were donated by more than 40 domestic goods factories, totaling more than 1,100 items, divided into 200 numbers. The preparatory committee members, Sun Daosheng and Hu Hanzhu, were responsible for the distribution and numbering in advance, which was very laborious and appreciated by all colleagues. The method of receiving the prize was to match the voucher number, and Sun and Hu, as well as Xu Chihen, Zhang Zhiren, and I, were responsible for awarding the prizes. The first prize was won by Mr. Li Zhusan, which was a set of crepe fabric from the Meiya Factory, worth 30 yuan. The items worth 20 yuan, 10 yuan, and 5 yuan were next in line, and the least was also worth 1 yuan. Some committee members initially showed humility and did not receive the prizes first, but in the end, they did not get anything, because there were also those who practiced "opportunism." In fact, although not all the guests came to receive the prizes, this move was enough to arouse common interest.</p>
<h3 id="e105">New Ci Poems from Xu Garden <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>Cui'er filled in a "Tune to Cui Lou Yin" to remember Banmu Garden and show it with recent scenery. Using the original rhyme, and also sending my thoughts.</p>
<p>Ice and snow open the window, winter green fence short, autumn colors full of low railings. The grapes are only half a frame, but still entangled by ivy. On the west side of the oyster wall, even a foot of hibiscus is taller than a person. Accustomed to half-leisure, unless the sparrows still come. Because I miss last year tonight in the Brahma Palace Hall, the moonlight played together. The yellow flowers are still like yesterday, but helplessly watching the flower viewers from afar. Liu Fan, like immortals, ask when to bring the chickens and dogs from Huainan. At sunset, what's the matter with the clouds wanting to return?</p>
<p>Tune to Cui Lou Yin - Remembering Banmu Garden - Xiao Cui</p>
<p>Grass accumulates deep steps, bamboo covers the window, dark green on the serene makeup. The landscape screen is only a few twists, how much flower shade blows in disarray. Don't cut the wisteria trellis, red dance, scattering the spring. It will be late, brewing sorrow, selling flutes in the alley. Who cares about the recent sunny and cloudy weather? The chessboard stones are cold, the poems on the leaves change. Outside the cloister willows, the thin phoenix sheng heart eyes. The Xuan Tai dreams are quiet, let the blue sky be blown. Unless you ask the fireflies, deep in the night under the flowers, to find them.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Record of a Strange Dog <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Haizhu</p>
<p>Five days after the Beginning of Winter, the caretaker reported that Canglong had drowned in the water last night. Canglong was one of the dogs raised by the owner. The dog was blue-gray in color, hence the name Canglong (Blue Dragon). The death of a dog is nothing more than adding a pile of dirt, nothing strange. After a while, the servants all said it was a strange event, spreading the word with changed expressions. I hurried to the door and asked them to show me what they had seen. It was indeed strange. The owner woke up in the morning and did not know that the dog had died. He told his family that he had dreamed of his mother earnestly instructing him to maintain his personal conduct and teach his children as usual. Behind his mother stood a middle-aged maidservant with a thin face and dark clothes. His mother said, "This servant is loyal and diligent and still comes to guard our door. You should reward her." The family thought that it was because the funeral had just finished, and he was missing her. The owner thought to himself whether there was such a person among the servants of his ancestors. The gardener then reported the death of the dog. The owner said sadly, "That's it! This dog is female. Her clothes are dark and her face is thin, which matches the description. This is not a nightmare, but a strange dream." The family also sobbed and mourned. The owner ordered the servants to bury it in a deep pit in the shade of the garden. The owner also wrote a eulogy in the form of a couplet: "Traveling the road was difficult, a misstep became an eternal regret. Guarding the door was hard work, loyalty was higher than ordinary people." The words were earnest and the entrustment was profound. I also have the lines "Living, it barked at the immortal clouds, following Du Yu. Dying, it looked up at the Buddhist sun, reaching the lotus pond" to eulogize this strange dog. According to Tang Dynasty's Du Guangting, his family raised a dog named Feiyun. When the owner's grandmother, Du, returned to the Buddha, she once recited a Buddhist verse, and the curved pond where the dog drowned still had remnants of lotus pillows and blue waves. Therefore, I used it in a mixed way. More strange is that when Du's grandmother was about to die, three dogs barked for no reason, and this dog cried all night long. Therefore, dogs are also righteous and strange. I have written it all down for researchers of the soul to study.</p>

<p>— Heng Zhuang</p>
<p>After the servant love case in Shanghai, the film company immediately made a film about the facts. At that time, someone also promoted that Huang Huiru would personally give a lecture on the beginning and end of the love affair. However, as a result, Huang Huiru not only failed to sacrifice her beauty, but also sacrificed her life first, so that the general public who longed for Huang Huiru never got to see the beauty of a celebrity. Not long after, the love affair between Wu Airong and the dumb Lin Jim occurred one after another. For a time, newspapers competed to report on it, and the momentum was no less than that of Huang Lu. Therefore, the current affairs film company also rose one after another and intensified its efforts, asking the person to star in the film "Dumb Lovers". Now that the film has been completed, it is scheduled to premiere on the 20th of this month at the Central Grand Theater, and I implore the two great lovers to perform funny dramas and lectures on the love affair. Lin Wu agreed, preparing to vent the grievances in their hearts and correct the misinterpretations of their love by society in the past.</p>
<p>Juan said that since domestic films have been taking social facts as the subject matter of the drama, and the owners of the facts have been the actors, and even the person has been asked to give a lecture on the course of events, this film should be the beginning of this.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Travel Notes from Nanyang (76) <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>The highest wage is three or four yuan per day. Those who are near the furnace and those who are on the top of the high level are easily infected with diseases by inhaling silver dust in the hot fire and soil ash into the lungs. I felt that my lungs were heavier after standing for a minute. How can I imagine doing this for years? However, if the injury is caused by the field system, the family will be compensated with hundreds of silver for injury to a limb and 3,000 yuan for death, but someone must apply for it, not everyone can get it. It is more worthy of investigation than the soldiers who died in battle. There are also workers who stand in deep muddy water to transport silver sand and mud, their faces are pale. Those who are near the furnace guard the red silver water and green firelight, watching the rotation of the machine's big wheels. Every time I think, is there really a hell of hot iron ruled by Yama in the world like this furnace, and beings are spinning in the Dharma wheel? Is it a delusion, or is it that everyone is using silver money fraudulently and has not seen the fire wheel in the silver field, so they do not know its manufacture and change? Then how can I determine that there is no bigger hammer than this field and that we have not seen it? I once entered a coal mine several miles in Taiyuan. Since then, I remember the suffering of coal workers every time I sit on the train. Now I have seen the silver field and sighed at the difficulty of using money. Who is spending money like dirt? Money is as lethal as cannonballs.</p>
<p>Among the strange customs of Nanyang, there are women of the White Ban Yi tribe who wrap their heads with cloth, which is unusually high, as much as one and a half feet. The cloth used is ordinary blue cloth. It is hot here, but they wrap their heads like this. However, there are also many women who do not wrap their heads or wear powder, their natural beauty is better than embellishments. There are two types of Ban Yi people here, one is the local Ban Yi, and the other does not speak the same language as Burmese. There is a Yunnan Ban Yi person who speaks the Dian language, just like a Chinese person, and is a mixed race.</p>
<p>Waking up on the morning of the 10th, the island sounds were pleasant and the green mountains reflected the people. The weather was about April and August, and single clothes were suitable. The weather in northern Burma is the best. China is too cold and the equator is too hot. The climate in northern Burma is the most suitable.</p>
<p>The great discovery of this trip to Nanyang that can be contributed to the world is that the great immigration business in Nanyang should be jointly operated by the international community in order to reduce class struggle and ease world wars. If the federation of Europe, Asia, and the Americas cannot be formed, then the Asian federation can be formed first. Nanyang can immigrate at least 100 million people. Why do the Japanese have to spend so much conspiracy in the eastern provinces to move so few people? A friend said that there are still places like Yeren Mountain outside the southwest border of Yunnan, which can accommodate tens of millions of people for thousands of miles.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 15: The Four Chambers Shed Tears, Sad and Red Feelings; The Seat Is Filled with Admiration, Lingering and Green Thoughts.</p>
<p>Long Ziyun was an old guest of the Bao family. He had known A Su since she was thirteen years old. He used to think she was gentle and pitiable, but now she was obviously slender and outstanding. In the past two years, several of the Bao family's Yun were accompanied by her to sing, so she felt that she had the material to respond. Her eyebrows could speak, and her every frown and smile seemed to have her own effect. Later, many guests called the Bao family's games for her sake. A Su's absence made people unhappy. Gradually, her position in the family became more powerful. Originally, in the Shanghai halls in the past, those who went out were called ladies, and those who accompanied them were called Sister A, with clear distinctions that could not be misrepresented. In name, there was a master-servant relationship. The talented people in the foreign circles also divided them into flowers and leaves, and they were often paired evenly. Often, the beautiful lady was not concerned with the one who accompanied her. It even went so far as to have an old woman accompany her. However, those who were fascinated would not hate this old woman, just like a famous artist who painted flowers, with a strange stone set off next to a beautiful flower, thus making it more beautiful. If the lady who went out was of mediocre appearance and of average talent, then the person who assisted her had to be a wonderful choice. This was like in the early monarchical political system, when the emperor was young, there had to be an experienced minister to assist him. Therefore, the young gentlemen in the halls also had to have a good Sister A to accompany them. To use flowers and leaves as a metaphor, although the flower is small, the leaves are very lush, and it is also moving. Moreover, there are those guests whose intention is not in the flower but in the leaves. In autumn, the red leaves are more beautiful than the flowers in February. If you think about it this way, you can see that the leaves can also be better than the flowers. Now, A Su can naturally be regarded as the famous leaf at that time. In less than half an hour, the games that were called came one after another. A Su came with Luyi as the third to arrive. When she arrived on the stage, she greeted her with a full greeting, calling Long Ziyun Fourth Master. Not only did she know everyone in the guest room, but she also knew most of the so-called little sisters in the game that were called. In the past, Sister A who followed the game used to fill the water pipes, but Long Ziyun did not smoke any kind of smoke. A Su smiled and said, "Fourth Master does not smoke water pipes, so we are considerate of us, and we are happy to save effort." She picked up a silver water pipe bag and stood next to her smilingly. She also said to the little girl Luyi, "Sister, Fourth Master knows you." She also said to Long Ziyun, "Fourth Master, please be tolerant. Our sister is coming out for the first time, and she is afraid that it will be difficult, and she is not willing to call anyone." Ling Zhixiang interjected from the side, "Okay, with you, Sister A Su, accompanying her, what are you afraid of?" At this time, Zuo Shichen, who was sitting opposite Long Ziyun, was staring at Luyi with both eyes, completely lost in thought.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Financial and Gold Markets Are Hot and Rising <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Various Backgrounds Create a Rising Trend</p>
<p>Yesterday, the 18th, the benchmark gold price saw another sharp rise. The rising trend was very strong and the pace was agile. However, in the morning market, there was a difference of four taels in several payments. In the afternoon market, there was also a review of four taels. As for remittances, both the official and unofficial rates were good, and the listed price was reduced by half a grade. Among the industry players, Xu had to crawl in, and the trading of each number was quite enthusiastic, mainly covering short positions. Hengxing, Shengda, Huatai, Jiutai, Yuanmao, Yong, etc. all competed to buy. However, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Xieyu, and hedgers were all selling positions. In the morning, overseas silver prices were low, especially the United States, which sold a lot of silver. Also, because the injury of Hamaguchi seemed to be turning around and there was no danger to his life, people's hearts turned from weak to strong, and they had already exceeded the 80 tael mark. Afterwards, Hengxing and others bravely resisted the short position, and the market atmosphere felt even more flying. The price was lifted and shook straight up. From morning to noon, it rose by more than four taels. However, there was a fluctuation of one or two taels from time to time. In the afternoon, Yuanxing, Yongchang Sheng Yong, etc. covered short positions for a certain speculator. However, Dalian Gang, Fuchang, Yuanmao Yong, etc. continued to sell. The market situation was initially flat, and afterwards, Indian remittances repeatedly reported low prices, and it was rumored that several banks in Citibank suddenly suspended operations. Therefore, the banking sector had to prepare cash. Therefore, the silver market was afraid of falling. Therefore, after the market got this news, major investors competed to buy, and the wind and clouds rose in an instant, almost reaching the top of the sun. Finally, it rose sharply to 87 taels, the first new high price since the swap. The silver market is expected to continue to fall this morning.</p>
<p>Step-by-step increase, flying phenomenon appears from time to time. The benchmark gold price for the January period opened in the morning at 580 taels and 800 yuan, an increase of 3.2 yuan (gross price was about 79.5-81 yuan, buyers were active). The recent large-scale low was one-sixteenth, and the forward was not changed. The silver price fell by one-quarter. Therefore, people's hearts were quite firm. After the rotation, there was a four or five yuan increase or decrease. Later, because Hengxing sold in, it rose to 82.2 yuan. At that time, various companies settled English gold, and Anda sold January at 17375. Sanjing sold March at the same price. Hedgers sold out, so the price was reduced by seven or eight yuan for one tael and four or five yuan. When the first order was issued, the price rose to 82.2 yuan because the listing was reduced by 125 US dollars and the 25-day gold was added to 75 yuan. Then, Fuchang and others sold out, which was sold by Mitsui Sumitomo in March English gold at 17375, so it fell back to about two yuan. At 9:30, it was 1.34 yuan for one tael. Not long after, Hengxing Shengda Yongfeng Cuitai Fuxing Yong and others scrambled to buy, and the first order was also tight. Sumitomo bought one or two months at 17375, and then Xiangjie had to count 3125. Therefore, the gold price jumped three yuan to 84.23 yuan at 10:30. Yuancheng Shuiyu Da and others sold out, and it depreciated by 1 yuan and 0 cents in more than ten minutes. At 11 o'clock, it was 3.1 yuan. At 11:15, it had already increased, and a US dollar for January was traded between the US Commercial Bank at 39.125 yuan. HSBC also appeared in English gold at 17125, and Yu Da Fuxing Yong and others had all chased in until 11:20, reaching 85.23 yuan. Yuanxing and others sold out and depressed the price to 4.1 yuan. By noon closing, it was still 5.2 yuan, which was actually due to the fact that there were fewer notes and the quoted price had been changed to 618.6 yuan. The daily gold listing was 75 yuan, the morning press was 36.7 yuan, and the noon was 33.4 yuan.</p>
<p>The closing price rose by 9.3 yuan. The afternoon market opened at 84.5 yuan, followed by 4.8 yuan. Because the Indian exchange rate reported a small two annas, the sellers in the market saw more, such as Yu Da, Taixing, Fuchang, Yuanmao Yong, etc. Therefore, at 2:50, it fell to 83.12 yuan, and the Japanese gold was also frustrated. Mitsui initially bought the current period at 1 yuan and 2.7 points, and then Sumitomo bought 1 yuan, 2.6 points, and 8125. Suddenly, news came that Citibank had bankrupt banks, so the big notes were afraid of falling, so they immediately added more than 1 yuan. At 3:30, it was 8.34 yuan, and it immediately returned to 2.23 yuan. Because Sumitomo and others sold English gold in January at 173125, it was a hedged sale of notes. In the future, English gold was only counted as 1725 for settlement, and it was heard that Indian remittances continued to fall by four or five annas. The reason was that major investors such as Yuanxing Yong covered short positions, and the market demand was greater than the supply, so people's hearts were strong and the price soared by more than 3 yuan. The market situation was extremely sharp, and it seemed to be soaring into the sky. At 4:20, it reached 86.89 yuan, and then it went down by three or four cents, and then it rose to 87 yuan. At 4:30, the closing price was 86.9 yuan (around 7 yuan later), an increase of 9 yuan compared to the previous day. The highest for the day was 87 yuan and the lowest was 80.06 yuan, with a difference of 6.4 yuan. The listing was reduced by 32 yuan, with accounts registered at 92 yuan, 88 yuan, and 85 yuan. The water was replenished at 92 yuan, and in the afternoon at 94 yuan. The goods market was 80.8 yuan in the morning, 5.2 yuan at noon, and 4.4 yuan in the afternoon, with the closing price at 6.8 yuan.</p>
<p>Guangdong merchants covered more than 6,000 notes, and the trading between peers was very strong. Hengxing and Shengda covered more than 6,000 notes for a long time. Dajiu Da, Yongfeng, Yuanmao Yong, Hongxing Yong, Yu Da, Fuxing Yong, and Yongkang all entered. Dadecheng, Zhifeng Yong, Shunli, Wanxing, Yuancheng Yong, and Yuanxing Yong had fluctuating ins and outs. Fuchang, Yuanheng, Xieyu, Tongtaichang, and hedgers all went out. In the afternoon, Xieyu, Shunli, Wanxing Fuchang, Yu Da, and Yuanmao Yong all went out. Yuanxing Yong, Yiyu, Yufa Yong, Changsheng Yong, and Chunfa Yong all entered. Dalian Gang bought seven or eight hundred notes and sold more than two thousand notes in total.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Sudden Sharp Increase in Foreign Exchange Rates <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The United States is inclined to sell silver, and there is an increased perception of cash value. Chinese merchants are rushing to buy, and listed prices have shrunk by half a grade. Yesterday, the overseas silver market reported lower prices, and exchange rates also decreased. However, the Kobe market did not change. HSBC listed prices have all shrunk by half a grade: British gold is 125 for one shilling and seven pence; 125 US dollars shrunk by .25, totaling 38.75 yuan; Japanese gold rose by .75, totaling 1 tael, 2 mace, 8 fen, and .25; Indian shrunk by .75, totaling 107 rupees and a half; French francs shrunk by 7 yuan, totaling 985 yuan; German exchange decreased slightly by 1 yuan, totaling 162.5 marks; and Japanese silver shrunk by .75, totaling 96 taels. Singapore exchange increased by 1 tael, totaling 145 taels and a half. Hong Kong did not change, remaining at 82 taels. Domestic market prices also rose sharply, mainly because the gold market suddenly surged, exceeding 85 taels. Major players such as Hengxing Shengda and speculators aggressively covered their short positions, causing prices to suddenly soar. Consequently, all exchange rates, compared to the previous day, showed decreases: British gold shrunk by .125, US dollars shrunk by .3125, and Japanese gold astonishingly rose by .01375 or more. This was mainly because the United States was inclined to sell silver bars, and there were rumors of bank closures, leading to concerns that silver prices would decrease and the value of cash would increase. Consequently, sentiment was greatly boosted, and Chinese merchants such as Taikangrun, Fuchang, Yuanheng, and other gold firms rushed to buy. Moreover, British and American tobacco companies also settled their accounts, with British gold transactions exceeding 200,000 pounds. Banks were also willing to sell. Banks such as Shanghai, Anda, Mitsui Sumitomo Maihang, HSBC, and Huabi all provided supplies, while Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Maihang also slightly absorbed. Chinese merchants generally hedged out gold. US dollars were traded against 120,000 yuan, and Japanese gold was slightly settled in the morning. In the afternoon, the Dalian gang sold tens of thousands of yuan in cash from Dalian, which was absorbed by Korea, Mitsui, and Sumitomo. Market sentiment suddenly became sharp, and silver prices are expected to continue to decline.</p>
<p>The internal market for British exchange fluctuated by .125 throughout the day. In the morning, the November price was one shilling, seven pence, and .3125; December .375. The buying price for January was increased by .0625. The closing price for November was 1.875, and for January .25.</p>
<p>The internal market for US exchange fluctuated by .375. In the morning, the November price was 39.125 yuan; December .25. The buying price for January was increased by .125. The closing price for November was 38.8125 yuan, and for January .9375.</p>
<p>The internal market for East exchange fluctuated by .75 throughout the day. From the early morning, the November price was 1 tael, 2 mace, 7 fen; December .675; January .65. The buying price was reduced by half a fen. At noon, the November price was 1 tael, 2 mace, 7 fen and .5; December .725; January .7. In the afternoon, the closing price for November was 1 tael, 2 mace, 7 fen and .75; December .75; January .725. The buying price was slightly increased by half a fen to .275.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Decline in British and American Silver Markets <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to a large dispatch from London, the near-term silver price fell .0625 to sixteen pence and .6875 (equivalent to British gold at one shilling, seven pence, and .75). There was no change in the forward price, calculated at sixteen pence and .625. China sold, India purchased, and the market was stable. After the market closed, there was a lack of buyers, and the United States was inclined to sell, leading to a sluggish market. Additionally, a New York dispatch indicated that the US silver price also fell by .25, with spot prices at three corners and six fen. The British exchange rate against the US dollar and the US dollar against the British pound both decreased by .03125 to four yuan, eight corners, five fen and .59375. The Japanese dollar remained at 49.625 yuan, and the British exchange rate remained at two shillings .0053125. The British Shanghai shilling increased by .0625 to one shilling, seven pence, and .625. There was no dispatch from Bombay.

<p>Although the 96 bonds declined by approximately 2 yuan, spot government bonds saw various openings yesterday but only sporadic transactions. The futures market appeared slightly calmer than before. Trading in severance pay, conscription, the 19 Customs bonds, and the 96 bonds remained active. Regarding the situation with various government bonds, the 96 bonds saw persistent selling pressure, causing the price to weaken. As a result, compared to the previous day, the current month futures fell by 1 yuan and 9 jiao and a half, and the following month futures fell by as much as 2 yuan and 2 jiao. While the trends for other bonds were more stable than before, the Customs 19 bonds and severance pay futures slightly decreased compared to the previous day, while spot Customs and severance pay bonds rose by 2-3 yuan compared to the previous week.

<h3 id="e115">Slackening Trend in Yarn and Cotton Markets <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market remained weak as sales of spot yarn were sluggish again. Various merchant groups lacked the ability to make large purchases, and buyers in the futures market were scarce. Some manufacturers were continuously selling their recent long positions, with no intention of taking delivery. However, the Chaozhou merchant group was covering short positions in the near month, and based on the current situation, a fluctuating trend is expected.</p>
<p>The price of artificial yarn fell by 7-8 qian. The artificial yarn restricted standard market opened with mixed news on US cotton, keeping sentiment steady. Prices for all months rose by 2-3 qian. News of sluggish spot sales caused a sudden drop, resulting in a decline of 2-4 qian for all months. In the afternoon, due to the declining trend of raw cotton and weak actual demand, the market remained sluggish, with near months falling by 3-4 qian and distant months falling by 1 qian. The total daily turnover was 12,600 dan. Sales included 1,850 bales from Hengda, 600 bales from Yuande, and the remainder from 400-500 bales. Purchases included 1,100 bales from Yiyu, 700 bales from Shenji, 650 bales from Dafeng, 1,100 bales from Yuda, and the remainder from 400-500 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Month | Closing Price | Change | Open Interest | Month | Closing Price | Change | Open Interest</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>November | 14.51 | Down 0.07 | 2,5050 | January | 14.74 | Down 0.08 | 33,451</p>
<p>December | 45.78 | 31750 | February | 14.86 | 43000</p>
<p>January | 14.64 | 53651 | March | 14.91 | 3180</p>
<p>Spot demand was weak again. Sales of spot yarn were lackluster. Daily purchases from various groups totaled 895 bales, including 25 bales from fellow merchants, 275 bales from Sichuan, 115 bales from Shantou, 80 bales from inland provinces, 45 bales from Niuzhuang, 140 bales from Guangdong, and 120 bales from various merchant groups.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Little Change in Cotton Market <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market was calm, with minimal fluctuations in US cotton. The local market did not see significant changes. In the futures market, the intention of longs to squeeze shorts had not been dispelled, so there was still a large change. However, spot demand was not very active. Factories were ordering cheap Indian cotton, but in reality, there was no active upward momentum. Fortunately, the supply of Han cotton was not smooth, and farmers in various villages were holding back from selling, so the longs were tightening their grip and unwilling to let go.</p>
<p>The price of Han standard cotton rose in the near month and fell in the distant month. The Han standard market opened with no major fluctuations in US cotton. The price of the near month rose by 1.5 fen. Due to a lack of buyers, the market changed again, with all months falling by 1-2 qian, resulting in a flat outcome. In the afternoon, the market opened with a sudden drop of 1.5 qian due to rumors of financial instability in the United States and the potential failure of several banks, causing the market to fall suddenly. Later, news from the long side that spot cotton transactions were slightly better caused the market to recover. As a result, the near month rose by 1.5 qian, and the distant month fell by 5 fen. The total daily turnover was 50,000 dan. Sales included 2,400 dan from Gongtai, 4,000 dan from Dachangcheng, 2,700 dan from Tiancheng, and the remainder from 1,600-2,700 dan. Purchases included 8,600 dan from Ruidai, 3,700 dan from Rongxing, 2,900 dan from Yuanda, 2,700 dan from Yuda, and the remainder from 1-2,000 dan. The closing prices for Han standard cotton are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e118">Fluctuating Rice Market Downriver <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, over 30 merchant groups arrived in Zhabei. In the early morning, due to crowding on the Shanghai West cargo ships, sellers briefly lowered their prices. Later, as the river channel slightly cleared, sales turned sluggish. New japonica rice, except for the top grade due to scarcity, continued to open at 15.5 yuan, while ordinary japonica rice was cut by 0.05-0.1 yuan. Both thin indica rice arrivals and sales were slow, and high-quality goods continued to open at 14.5 yuan. Sales of late indica rice had stagnated. Although the supply of Duzi indica rice had dried up, the market appetite was extremely weak. Therefore, the above showed a fluctuating trend, with prices generally opening around 13 yuan. The pier and main street moved slightly, but the market did not rise or fall, and only customer tips showed slight fatigue of around 0.1 yuan. Transmuted yuan top-grade goods were set at 15 yuan for Guanwai.</p>
<p>Yesterday, over 10 merchant groups were seen in Shanghai South downriver. Sales on the main street were acceptable, and the common merchant group's top-grade japonica rice was firmly set. Medium-grade was also tight. Near-term indica rice from Jiangsu and Tongbai rose. The special top-grade high-quality japonica rice opened at 15.15 yuan. Thin indica rice such as Qingding from Nanbang Sijing was Ning sales were particularly sluggish, with Qingding set at 14 yuan for Guanwai. Late indica rice was extremely scarce and still maintained a price of 12 yuan. The source of Duzi indica rice arrivals was relatively abundant. Currently, special top-grade indica rice was welcomed by customer groups, so it was slightly firm. Transmuted yuan rice was average, with special high-quality rice fluctuating around 12 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Unified Improvement in Flour Market <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The flour market was purely dominated by foreign news. Yesterday morning, all months in the market saw an improvement, as foreign wheat quotes in Chicago rose by 7-9 jiao and Canadian wheat rose by 1.2 yuan and 1.0 yuan, respectively. Therefore, all eyes were focused on foreign news. Generally, short positions were quickly covered, and inland merchant groups also felt that the market had fallen to such a low level that they had been thinking about it for a long time. Therefore, the weak buyers gradually turned to a more positive outlook, and the market atmosphere gradually became more active. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was still stable at first. As the sentiment of outside investors remained positive, the covering of short positions intensified, and all months improved again. This kind of rise and fall was entirely dominated by foreign countries. In terms of the facts of this city, although the standard had fallen greatly, the inventory of various factories was extremely low. For example, Fufeng spot goods had to be listed at the 7-day price plus 0.02 yuan compared to the standard. Zhonghua rarely inquired about the price compared to the standard. Fuxin and Shenda still had to deduct 0.03 yuan, which was an excessive drop in reality. As a result of the closing, the current month rose by 0.025 yuan compared to the previous day, December rose by 0.035 yuan, January rose by 0.04 yuan, February rose by 0.035 yuan, March rose by 0.03 yuan, and April rose by 0.035 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month was generally fluctuating. Although the opening for the current month was better than the previous day by 0.03-0.04 yuan, it still returned to looseness. For each distant month, as foreign wheat quotes improved, outside short sellers rose up to cover their positions. However, as the distant month was cheaper than the current month, outside longs were more active, and the market atmosphere also improved slightly. Looking at the future, if foreign wheat continues to improve, the standard situation may also be boosted. As a result, the current month was unchanged, December was up 0.02 yuan, January was up 0.04 yuan, February was up 0.03 yuan, and March/April were up 0.02 yuan. The spot wheat market was unchanged by various factories due to foreign wheat conditions.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Stagnation in Raw Silk, Tea, and Dried Cocoon Factory Sales <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Since the resumption of work, various silk factories in this city have mostly exhausted their raw materials and have been replenishing from various cocoon merchants. The market price of dried cocoons suddenly rose. However, since dramatic changes have occurred in the economic circles of the United States, France, and Japan, silk sales have become lifeless, and silk prices have fallen drastically. As silk telegrams are not being forwarded, factories have no intention of purchasing and accumulating dried cocoon raw materials. The cocoon market has returned to fatigue. Yesterday, the municipal association discussed the Hangzhou and Huzhou spring dried cocoons. Cocoon prices are expected to fall by 10 taels. Medium-sized factories' cocoon costs were less than 650 taels, and no transactions were heard. As for factory raw silk transactions, due to European sales remaining cautious, only Taihe and others sold 20 packages of white dried silk, and Kechang and others sold 22 packages of yellow rough silk, with prices remaining stable.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Sudden Trend of Fatigue and Quiet in the Tea Market <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, tea market transactions were quite sparse. European and American merchants for Luzhuang Zhenmei Zhucha were mostly holding a wait-and-see attitude because they had not seen their telegrams from the previous week forwarded to Shanghai. Although there were sporadic transactions for items such as eyebrow show and eyebrow tea, selling prices were low. Gongxi green tea, the Bai Tou Zhuang sales were scarce. Only Russian merchants exclusively bought, and the market plate was difficult to stabilize. The Huazhou tea company bought over a thousand boxes of Ping Shui from Huzhou yesterday, with a selling price of 38.5 taels, which remained unchanged from before.</p>

<p>The sale price of six-liang Qingbing tea has been high since the release of new tea. The harvest has been reduced, so there are not many arrivals, and the top-grade Gengbing is also not seen. According to local news, the price must be 6 yuan, and the trend is quite firm. The sale price here has reached 6.4 taels, and the sales venue is still good. However, most of the transactions are scattered. Market prices have been high since the beginning, and it is difficult to see any relaxation for a while.</p>

<p>Coarse sand white sugar is gradually trending down. Yesterday, sugar market area telegraphs said that the price of Cuban raw sugar is still 1.50. The price of New York sugar futures for December is 1.35, for March next year is 1.48, for May is 1.54, and for September is 1.68. Compared to the previous telegram, all fell by 5 points, but May fell by 6 points. The price of Java sugar futures and spot sugar did not rise or fall. Transactions on the Public Association disc were quiet. Twenty-four coarse sand white Dutch sugar had sluggish buying, and the number of households that opened was quite high. The bidding price was as low as 7.6 taels, and few were inquired about. The weakness of the market was rare. Fine ground sand white sugar was 7.7 taels, and twenty medium sand white sugar was 6.8 taels. Transactions were also rare. Japanese sugar transactions were declining, and the market fell slightly again. N Mark was 7.675 taels, YT Mark was 7.625 taels, YP Mark was 7.925 taels, J Mark was 7.975 taels, YRO Mark was 7.125 taels, and Meiji goods were 7.075 taels. The market was declining. The disc of the National Goods Gaohu Red opened more than thirty packages at a price of 8.3 taels. Huaxin No. Cuban Red continued to sell, and the total amount before and after the original disc was about 13,000 bags, most of which had little remaining. It can be sold off in full. It also opened spot coarse sand white sugar 3,000 bags at a price of 7.6 taels. Taikoo Car Sugar was throwing goods, and delivery for December/January HX Mark was priced at 6.2 taels. The tax rate for new rules was high, and the shipping company's cost was more expensive than Japanese sugar, so there were few inquiries. Also, the company's Hong Kong-based Chief Auditor, Far East Investigator, Englishman Mi Qieer came to Shanghai a few days ago and invited people in the sugar industry in the afternoon yesterday to solicit opinions and establish relationships to promote business policy. It was slightly heard that at that time, in order to reward customers, there would be unconventional transactions.</p>

<p>(Opening Remarks)</p>
<p>Today, our Association holds a general election meeting to elect directors and committee members to the French Concession Board of Directors, who will serve as representatives of our Chinese taxpayers in executing and presiding over municipal affairs within the concession. This is something that deserves the utmost attention from our Chinese taxpayers. Our ultimate goal, of course, is to achieve freedom and equality for China, to complete the elements of an independent nation, and to recover the concessions, which is a common endeavor we should all undertake. However, in this transitional period, asserting the right to participate in municipal affairs and practicing such participation are necessary steps in implementing the principle of democracy, especially during the period of political tutelage, when we must strive to exercise the four powers. This is something that we all must strive to achieve. Furthermore, the future Board of Directors will be a board of directors for both Chinese and foreign residents, so all municipal facilities provided by the Board of Directors will be the responsibility of us Chinese taxpayers, because we will all be principals and there will be no room for excuses. This will prove that we have a deep understanding of both rights and obligations, and that we are not merely seeking the name of participating in municipal affairs without seeking the reality.</p>
<p>(Letter to the French Consul General)</p>
<p>Respectfully informing you that, regarding the matter of your esteemed Consul General entrusting our Association representatives to negotiate the political participation rights of Chinese citizens and the increase of representatives attending the Board of Directors, you agreed to promptly reply with the details of the agreement. However, we have yet to receive your esteemed reply. Therefore, we are writing again to request your reply.</p>
<p>Respectfully requesting Consul General Grieglynn.</p>
<p>French Concession Taxpayer Chinese Association.</p>
<p>(Reply from the French Consul General)</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Directors of the Shanghai French Concession Taxpayer Chinese Association:</p>
<p>Respectfully informing you that I have received your letter of the 16th of this month concerning the matter of Chinese citizen political participation and the addition of Chinese directors. This matter has been negotiated, and I am requesting a copy of the list of the five existing regular Chinese directors and the nine special committee members to facilitate verification.</p>
<p>Respectfully requesting your well-being.</p>
<p>Grieglynn, Chairman of the French Concession Board of Directors.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the inaugural meeting of the new and old Chinese directors and committee members is postponed to a later date due to the lateness of the hour.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Year-End Accounting Problem <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce's Application for Modification Denied.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Orders Businesses to Hasten Preparations</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce has reported that year-end closing of accounts presents difficulties for both agricultural and commercial situations. Various trade associations have repeatedly requested modifications, and the City Chamber of Commerce has specifically petitioned the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to request a change to the day before the Start of Spring as the closing date. The Bureau reportedly denied the request, stating that year-end closing of accounts according to the Gregorian calendar cannot be changed, and that Administrative Yuan Order No. 3850, instructing all provincial and municipal governments to follow this regulation, is on file and cannot be made an exception. Therefore, an order has been issued, the contents of which are recorded below.</p>
<p>Having read the petition, the Bureau finds that this year's Gregorian calendar year-end closing of accounts cannot be modified, as Administrative Yuan Order No. 3850 has already been issued to all provincial and municipal governments for compliance. The Chamber's request to use the day before the Start of Spring as the general closing date for businesses does not imply a desire to use the obsolete lunar calendar. However, business practices traditionally treat the year as a single accounting period, and bookkeeping records follow this example. This year, businesses have already followed the government's orders and recorded all information in their books according to the Gregorian calendar dates, with monthly summaries and annual closings conducted in accordance with the new calendar. Changing to February 4th would unnecessarily fragment the accounts and make calculations more difficult. This is the first reason.</p>
<p>Regarding the agricultural harvest season, according to the Twenty-Four Solar Terms issued by the central government, harvesting has already taken place around the Autumn Equinox in both the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins. The Frost's Descent term has passed, and preparations for winter farming have begun. By the time of the Start of Winter and Light Snow terms, farmers are idle and sell rice and beans for silver. This leaves more than a month to close the books before the year-end. There is no reason why accounting and settlement should be insufficient. The views of the Bean and Rice Trade Association, etc., seem somewhat limited to a corner, and the inland chamber of commerce seems to be indulging in old habits and resisting reform. The problem is clearly not purely about the accounting period. This is the second reason.</p>
<p>The Bureau notes that the three-term accounting system exists for the convenience of commercial and financial cycles, and there are also instances of month-end accounting. Logically, businesses have these various means of assistance, and the year-end closing is simply a general summary to assess the state of business profits and losses over the year, without affecting the length of the accounting period. Furthermore, the distance between accounting periods was previously five, three, and four months, but now it is five, four, and three months. Why is it necessary to seek an average? This is the third reason.</p>
<p>Regarding the various difficulties mentioned by the Chamber, if inland businesses had the same enthusiasm for complying with government orders as businesses in this city, there would be no difficulties. It should be understood that promoting the Gregorian calendar seeks uniformity in calendar administration, and that the consistent lunar calendar and accurate seasons are of great benefit to agriculture and commerce. This Bureau certainly knows that reform should not be rushed, but if it is deemed beneficial and related to government orders, compliance is mandatory. Otherwise, if everyone says they will wait until next year, procrastination and neglect will inevitably result. The late Premier Sun Yat-sen clearly established the correct calendar when the Republic was founded, but the promotion of the Gregorian calendar still requires our efforts today. The Chamber of Commerce should be a model for all businesses and should personally and actively urge members to prepare for the changes and not be mistaken. The request to use the day before the Start of Spring as the closing date cannot be approved. In addition to reporting the details of this order, this reply is issued for your information.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Mrs. Victor Bruce Flew to Korea Yesterday Morning <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Safely Arrived in Seoul Today</p>
<p>British female aviator Mrs. Victor Bruce departed from Hongqiao Airfield at 7:30 AM yesterday, flying directly to Seoul, Korea. The journey is estimated to be approximately 500 miles, diagonally crossing the Yellow Sea, making it one of the most difficult legs of her journey since departing from England. Mrs. Bruce estimated that it would take approximately five and a half to six hours.</p>
<p>At approximately 7:20 AM yesterday morning, Mrs. Bruce received a report from the Xujiahui Observatory indicating that the weather was favorable, with a gentle breeze accompanying her en route. She then decided to depart. There were only about fifty people at the airfield to see her off. The heavy 青島 [Qingdao] aircraft slowly ascended and headed north. Mrs. Bruce will pass through Chongming and enter the Yellow Sea. Her only safety equipment for the sea is a rubber raft. However, nearby British warships along the route have been ordered to prepare to provide assistance if they receive a distress signal from the woman.</p>
<p>According to news from the Japanese Consulate, Mrs. Bruce's flight coincided with the period of major Japanese military exercises. Many important areas were under martial law and prohibited from flying. As a result, there were many twists and turns in the flight route. The previous day, Mrs. Bruce personally visited the Japanese Consulate to negotiate. Consul Iguchi met with her and presented the required route, requesting permission from the Japanese government to pass through. The Japanese Consulate sent an urgent telegram to the Japanese government, and at approximately 10:00 PM that evening, a reply was received from the Japanese government granting permission to enter Korea near 38 degrees North latitude, passing through Mokpo. After receiving the telegram, Mrs. Bruce departed from Shanghai yesterday morning.</p>
<p>According to a Jiji Press report from Seoul last night, British female aviator Mrs. Victor Bruce departed from Shanghai at 7:30 AM on the 18th, passed over Mokpo at 12:45 PM, and safely arrived in Seoul at 3:43 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Twists and Turns in the Reopening of Silk Factories <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Of the Shanghai silk factories that勉力 [did their best] reopened after heeding the advice of the Silk Industry Association, a total of thirty-two, twenty-three, including Xin Chang in Zhabei and Xin Zha, have already resumed normal operations. However, workers at nine silk factories, including Yuan Feng in Hongkou, are unwilling to accept wage cuts, leading to labor-management disputes. At the time, the trade union had a standing committee member (Eastern District Trade Union), Chen Zhongxiang, detained by the police precinct, who went to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to appeal. The trade union convened a workers' congress the day before yesterday, intensifying the labor unrest. The Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, the Civil Training Committee, the Public Security Bureau, and the Social Affairs Bureau jointly issued a notice ordering the factories to resume work immediately. The Silk Industry Association also notified the nine factories that they must resume work on the 19th (today). The nine silk factories, including Yuan Feng, immediately notified their employees to sign in and resume work. However, the staff members refused to sign, and even the female workers were hesitant. Therefore, the resumption of work at the nine silk factories on the 19th is likely to be difficult to achieve because the labor side has no sincerity in cooperating with the capital side. It is now reported that the government authorities have stepped in to mediate, and staff wages have been increased to 85%, while the female workers' wages, calculated at 85%, may not be a problem if it amounts to 50.1 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Revision of Regulations on the Export of Prohibited Antique Books <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Customs and Shipping Companies Strictly Enforce the Ban</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, in order to preserve national treasures, requested a ban on the export of antique books. It was previously stipulated that editions printed in the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, as well as palace editions printed in the Qing dynasty, and editions published more than ten years ago, etc., were prohibited. This matter was previously reported in this newspaper. It is now reported that the prohibition of these antique books has been difficult to enforce because a clear standard for selection and evaluation is needed for customs to follow. The Ministry of Finance has revised the prohibited book list, adding a list of prohibited items and the procedures for evaluation. The revised regulations have been sent to the Jianghai Customs and forwarded to shipping companies for compliance. The revised regulations on the export of prohibited antique books are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) List of Prohibited Items:</p>
<p>A. Thread-bound woodblock-printed books and paintings printed before the first year of the Xianfeng reign in the Qing dynasty.</p>
<p>B. Original movable copper-type illustrated books. (Items A and B were added by the Ministry of Finance)</p>
<p>C. Yongle Encyclopedia</p>
<p>D. Official government archives (added by the Ministry of Finance)</p>
<p>E. Handwritten manuscripts and carefully proofread editions (this refers to original manuscripts written by the author, whether published or not, which should be prohibited). Carefully proofread editions, meaning editions proofread by famous people, should also be prohibited.</p>
<p>F. Surviving works by Sun Yat-sen that have not been printed.</p>
<p>(2) Evaluation Procedures:</p>
<p>A. For woodblock-printed antique books, the evaluation is based on the dynasty or year of printing. If the dynasty or year of printing is unclear, the date of the preface or colophon is used. If the date of the preface or colophon is unclear, the birth and death dates of the author of the preface or colophon are used.</p>
<p>B. If any doubts arise during the evaluation of the above items, the customs office must send the original book to the Ministry of Finance, which will consult the Ministry of Education for evaluation. If there are too many volumes, a few volumes may be randomly selected and sent to the Ministry of Education, or the Ministry may send a committee to evaluate them. For customs offices too far from Beijing, they may report to the Ministry of Finance, which will consult the Ministry of Education and instruct the local provincial or municipal education bureau to jointly evaluate the items with the customs office.</p>
<p>(3) Compliance by Shipping Companies:</p>
<p>Yesterday, when the shipping companies received this order from the Ministry, they instructed their export counters to pay close attention to declared cargo. If there are books to be exported, they must be inspected according to the Ministry's order before they can be loaded. The customs office is also paying special attention to inspecting export goods to check for the presence of antique books being illegally transported.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Shipping News <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Heavily Purchasing Mahjong Tiles, Shipping Rates to Southeast Asia Rise</p>
<p>Shanghai shipping companies, including Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, Nissin Kisen, and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, have increased freight rates by 10% across the board due to heavy cargo volume to South China ports. The increase took effect yesterday. The freight rates for items such as cloth have also increased at the same time. For example, cotton yarn to Shantou has increased from 2.2 taels to 2.4 taels per piece, to Hong Kong from 2.5 taels to 2.8 taels, and to Guangzhou from 3.5 taels to 3.8 taels. Fabric to Shantou has increased from 7.26 taels to 8 taels per ton, to Hong Kong from 8 taels to 8.8 taels, and to Guangzhou from 12 taels to 13.2 taels.</p>
<p>Water Level in Haizhou Sharply Decreases</p>
<p>The water level in Haizhou has recently dropped sharply, making it impossible for larger ships to navigate. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has decided to temporarily suspend the 華輪 [Huā Lún] ship's service to Haizhou until the water level rises. Due to heavy cargo volume to Dalian, it has been decided to dispatch the 同華 [Tóng Huá] ship to operate on the Shanghai-Dalian route.</p>
<p>Demand for Mahjong Tiles Transported to Japan Increases</p>
<p>Chinese mahjong tiles were popular in the United States four or five years ago, but exports were banned due to inferior quality. Recently, mahjong games have become popular in Japan, and local production cannot meet the demand. As a result, many mahjong tiles are being purchased from China. In the past month, each ship to Japan has carried a large number of mahjong tiles, averaging about three tons per ship. This trend is continuing.</p>

<p>According to a letter from Central Pharmacy, the Shanghai Concession Taxpayer Chinese Association reported that the pharmacy's premises are rented from the Catholic Church on Nanshan Road, Hongkou, and that the tenants are responsible for the water bill, which is collected by the landlord. Previously, the Association announced that water fees would be increased but were to be paid at the original price until the issue was resolved. When the church collected the October rent, the pharmacy paid the water bill at the original price, but the church's rent collector refused to accept it. Recently, the church sent another letter demanding that the increased water price be paid, or the water pipe would be removed and the lease terminated. The pharmacy specifically requested guidance from the Association. The Association replied immediately, stating, "Regarding your letter of November 15th concerning the water price increase, we have carefully read it. The investigation of the water price increase issue is nearing completion, and it will soon be decided whether to increase the price. The Catholic Church is only collecting the water fee on behalf of the water company, and your pharmacy is not refusing to pay the water fee, only temporarily not paying the 25% increase in accordance with public opinion. The Catholic Church's attitude is improper and may even involve tenancy issues. If the Catholic Church actually takes such action, it will cause public anger among all residents and lead to serious unfortunate events, for which the church will be responsible." A corresponding letter has been sent to the church for its information.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Appeal from the Changxing Coal Mine <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The board of directors of the Changxing Coal Mine Company, whose mining rights were revoked by the Construction Committee, has been continuously striving for reinstatement without success. As the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee has opened, the board of directors has unanimously decided to continue to strive for reinstatement and convene a general meeting of shareholders to address the situation. The shareholders' representatives submitted a letter to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's secretariat for the Fourth Plenary Session, stating, "We, the Changxing Coal Mine Company of Zhejiang, which is entirely commercially operated, have been affected by the Qi-Lu wars since 1924, and have been seeking to resume operations. However, in the winter of 1927, the Construction Committee revoked the company's mining rights on the pretext, and sent personnel to the mine to forcibly operate it for three years. We have repeatedly appealed to various government agencies to report our unwarranted loss of employment. Recently, the Construction Committee used the name of the Changxing Coal Mine Bureau to publish notices in newspapers, forcing the company to send representatives to collect compensation bonds. We understand that we have put Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Fourth Plenary Session proposals on file, stating that the government's recovery of privately owned mining businesses was a miscalculation, and proposed that privately owned industries should be encouraged and appropriately protected in the future. We are deeply grateful for Chairman Chiang and the committee members' concern for the people's hardships. The company has outstanding debts of over 3.1 million yuan to various banks in Shanghai over the years. After the publication of the compensation bond notices, the banking consortium and shareholders strongly opposed it and did not recognize the company's directors as having full responsibility to represent the shareholders. If they receive the bonds, the disputes with the shareholders and the banking consortium will never be resolved. We are fortunate that at the opening of the Fourth Plenary Session, Chairman Chiang and the committee members are upholding the protection of private property. We are taking the liberty of submitting this report and requesting that this case be submitted for public judgment. If we are given our mining rights back, it would be like a rebirth. We are urgently sending this telegram. We respectfully wish you well."</p>

<p>The Ministry of the Navy Sent Wu Zhennan as a Special Envoy</p>
<p>The Yangtze River Pilot Training Institute, established by the Ministry of the Navy within the Haidao Measuring Bureau at Fenglin Bridge, Xinzha District, is training pilots for the Yangtze River in preparation for the recovery of pilotage rights. Classes began in April of this year and have now reached the end of the academic year. The Ministry of the Navy sent Wu Zhennan, director of the Coastal Patrol Office, as a special envoy to conduct a thorough examination with the director of the institute, Yu Zhenxing, and the faculty. As most of the pilots are scattered at various ports along the Yangtze River, the examination period is set for three weeks. Yesterday was the first day of the examination. All pilots currently in Shanghai were ordered to attend the examination. A total of thirty-four pilots attended. The examination method consisted of written and oral tests. The pilots were able to answer the questions based on their coursework and experience. The results were excellent. This will lay a foundation for the country's future recovery of pilotage rights. The examination started at 2:00 PM and lasted until 5:00 PM.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession was previously building a pier near the Huzhang Shipping Bureau's pier on the Suzhou Creek, infringing on Chinese sovereignty. The Zhabei branch of the Pujiang Water Patrol Team intervened, and the work was stopped pending negotiations at a higher level. Recently, the engineering department of the Shanghai Municipal Council again sent workers to fill mud and drive piles at the old Garbage Bridge, preparing to build a pier. The Pujiang Water Patrol Team discovered this and sent Deputy Captain Dou to order the workers to stop working. However, the workers said that they were acting on orders from the engineering department of the Shanghai Municipal Council and refused to stop. Deputy Captain Dou told the foreman that the Suzhou Creek was entirely under Chinese sovereignty and that they could not work there without the permission of the Shanghai Municipal Government. If they dared to disobey, they would be arrested. The foreman then ordered the workers to stop working.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Request to Prohibit the Import of Foreign Rice, Wheat, and Flour <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Fan Hesheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Rice and Grain Industry Association, submitted a document to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating that in order to protect the nation's vitality and maintain the farmers' economy, it is requested to prohibit the import of foreign rice, wheat, and flour. Our country was originally an agricultural country. In recent years, due to domestic military affairs and untimely droughts and floods, food shortages have been felt by the people, and they have been forced to purchase foreign rice as a temporary relief measure. The outflow of money has reached more than 100 million, and due to the relationship between expensive gold and cheap silver, the national economy is almost bankrupt. This year, the domestic rebellion has been quelled, the military affairs have been settled, and the autumn harvest is abundant. The people have plenty of food. The losses of farmers over the years and the nation's vitality are relying on recuperation and recovery. However, imperialist countries such as Japan, Russia, America, and Austria are competing to use China as a sales market in the Far East due to overcapacity. They are trying to transport large quantities of foreign rice, wheat, flour, etc. to China in order to destroy the economy of our farmers and the foundation of our country, which will be detrimental to the entire China. If this kind of poisonous policy of economic aggression is not strictly prevented, it will be more than enough to destroy China. It has been found that expensive rice hinders people's food, while cheap grain does not harm farmers. Therefore, the government bears the responsibility of concern for social livelihood and farmers' economy. It is specially requested to investigate and verify that in the Shanghai area, all groups related to people's food who have ordered goods from abroad should be required to register with your bureau by a deadline. Those who have not ordered goods should not continue to order. In the national aspect, it should be forwarded to the Municipal Government to request the National Government to issue an order to the coastal provincial governments and customs ports to prohibit the import of foreign rice, wheat, flour, etc. in order to protect the nation's vitality and maintain the farmers' economy. It cannot be hoped for. There is also news from this port that has been transferred to the next page.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Letters and Telegrams from All Parties Assisting the Xiao Case <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Telegrams to Commander Lin of Xiamen from Various Groups: Overseas Chinese Federation, Overseas Chinese Affairs Association, Seamen's General Union, Life Weekly, Taiwan General Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Citizens' Federation, Shanghai Women's Association, Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute Overseas Vocational Introduction Department, Shanghai Law School, Fujian Society, Yixing Society, and Xiao Case Support Association telegraphed Commander Lin of the Xiamen Garrison Command yesterday, saying: "Reading the newspaper, we were shocked to learn that in the midst of the national anti-Dutch atmosphere, Your Excellency suddenly violated public opinion by banning (boycotting the Java Wheel). If the reports are true, our associations and others deeply regret it for Your Excellency. If the reports are false, we deeply feel it is fortunate for Your Excellency. Perhaps Your Excellency thinks that Miss Xiao is only one of the 400 million people, and it is insignificant to defile or kill her. However, the 400 million people are all accumulated from one person. If the Dutch do not recognize Miss Xiao as a person and take turns raping her, then all those who share the same nationality and ethnicity as Miss Xiao will also be despised by the Dutch, including Your Excellency. Because Your Excellency is Chinese and Miss Xiao is also Chinese, when they were drilling into her room, grabbing her throat, and raping her, why did Your Excellency not think of leaving a little room for Miss Xiao, who shares the same nationality and ethnicity as Your Excellency, in Xiamen? The relationship between our associations and others and Miss Xiao is no different from the relationship between Miss Xiao and Your Excellency, but we are all Chinese and all Han Chinese. In the eyes of those who raped Miss Xiao, they only knew that Miss Xiao was a (deceptive) Chinese and a (useless) Han Chinese, and did not know what province or surname she was. Your Excellency banned (boycotting the Java Wheel) because you thought that it was not enough to help Miss Xiao, who was humiliated by foreigners, or did you have a good way to make the Dutch government punish the murderers, apologize, and guarantee that they would never abuse overseas Chinese or repeat the same facts in the future? If Your Excellency has a good way, the people of the country will obey. If we only blindly concede, suffer humiliation, and do not know shame, and are slaughtered and do not know pain, call (a horse a horse) and call (a cow a cow), can our associations and others not regret it for Your Excellency? This time, the anti-Dutch movement in your port has achieved the most remarkable results. The people of the country are persuading each other, saying that officials should be like Your Excellency and civilians should be like the people of Xiamen. But reading the telegram, we know that the integrity of Jingjiang is entirely given to the people and not to the officials. What is more, the Dutch have hated China not only since today. In the early years of the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, they massacred more than 10,000 overseas Chinese in Batavia, and the river water was red. The Manchus were not our race and abandoned the matter. The Dutch became even more unscrupulous, and their police soldiers slaughtered at will. In the past two hundred years, countless wronged souls have been created. In recent years, those who have been imprisoned and expelled for running schools, newspapers, and parties have reached hundreds. According to Article 109 of the Dutch Charter (Chinese people are assimilated to the natives), overseas Chinese who have just entered the country are arbitrarily detained, insulted in many ways, and treated more cruelly than prisoners. The inspection is so strict that women are not spared. Today, the Dutch consul, in order to recover the business of the Java Company, may temporarily condescend to please Your Excellency in the hope that Your Excellency will provide it for the use of oppressing the people. But once Your Excellency changes his name and disguise and goes under their iron hoof, those blue-eyed, bearded children will see his face and know that he is Chinese, and they will secretly curse and order him to wait in the prison cell for a guarantor to stop eating and drinking and speak loudly to repay Your Excellency's great virtue. Our associations and others love Your Excellency and secretly feel that Your Excellency should not do this. Recently, Chairman Chiang gave a lecture, saying: (Those who do not know nationalism or have no nationalistic thoughts are not worthy of being a complete citizen. We soldiers should especially understand that nationalism is a model for people.) He also said: (The military is to protect civil rights, not to oppress the people. If civil rights cannot be developed, the country cannot be independent. When in the army, we can be soldiers. When retired, we can be good citizens and work with the people to build the country and organize society. If civil rights can be developed, the country will be sound.) The motivation of the Xiamen Aid Xiao Association to boycott the Java Wheel stems from nationalistic thought, and the purpose is to realize nationalism, which is in line with Chairman Chiang's clear instructions. Our associations and others in Shanghai are calling for anti-Dutch revenge, which has also been permitted by the local party headquarters and telegraphed to the government by the General Assembly to celebrate the birthday of the Prime Minister to seriously negotiate. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently received a telegram from the Dutch envoy in China requesting to prevent the boycott of Dutch ships, and replied that (if the Xiao case can be handled fairly, the anger can be calmed down). We hope that Your Excellency will review Chairman Chiang's instructions, protect the people's rights, cooperate with the people, allow the withdrawal of the (banning the boycott of the Java Wheel) order, jointly avenge the shame of the nation, and jointly solve the plight of the overseas Chinese. Our associations and others sincerely wish it. Overseas Chinese Federation, Overseas Chinese Affairs Association, Seamen's General Union, Life Weekly, Shanghai Citizens' Federation, Shanghai Second District Women's Association, Taiwan General Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute Overseas Vocational Introduction Department, Shanghai Law School, Fujian Society, Yixing Society, Yixing Shanghai Xiao Case Support Association, respectfully appeal."</p>
<h3 id="e149">Support Association's Letter to Agent Comprador He Yesterday <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The Xiao Clan Support Association sent a letter to He Jinzhu, the agent comprador of the Java Company, saying: "The news of the misfortune of our clan member Miss Xiao Xin'an while abroad has spread, and the people of the whole country are indignant. Compatriots across the country should cooperate to avenge this shame. The spirit of cooperation hopes to achieve the final victory, the dignity of the nation, and the glory of the country, which is not only the expectation of a few people, but also the responsibility of compatriots across the country. We and others, mindful of the importance of this matter to the reputation of the country, have been working hard for a month. Unexpectedly, a member of the same clan and the same country with a brain is willing to risk the name of injustice and defend the Dutch, resulting in obstruction of the revenge process. Where is the spirit of mutual love and independence of the Chinese citizens, who are all of the same race? Any young man with a little blood would hear of this humiliating news and leave his job to be righteous. Today, you not only do not want to resign, but also protect the Dutch bandits. How can you face the country and the people? How can you face the overseas Chinese? Foreign overseas Chinese have never sent telegrams to all sectors of Shanghai to express their satisfaction with the removal of the chief and second mates. The tricks of dancing words and creating rumors are obvious. Is it different from betraying the country to publicly discuss crimes? Overseas Chinese newspapers in the Dutch East Indies cannot disclose the truth about humiliating the country because they are subject to Dutch power. Today, you use this as a tool for the Dutch to defend themselves, blinding the hearts of the people across the country and using it to cover up this shame and develop the business of the ship in China. Who is willing to endure this policy in terms of human feelings? Birds and beasts still know how to love each other. Are you not as good as the behavior of birds and beasts? We and others are willing to be the public enemy of compatriots across the country for the sake of eradicating national shame, saving the suffering of overseas Chinese, and promoting the indomitable spirit of our Chinese nation. We hope that you will consider this and reply.</p>

<p>The Women's Association sent a letter to the Overseas Chinese Federation yesterday, saying: "Replying directly, our association is the leading organization in the women's world. Our association should be responsible for assisting in the case of Miss Xiao Xin'an being humiliated by Dutch sailors. Now that your association has informed us that various groups have convened a joint meeting, our association will definitely come to participate as a founding member on time."</p>
<h3 id="e151">Pirates Clash <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Fierce fighting twice on the sea off Juegang, nine out of ten houses on land are empty. A large number of pirate ships suddenly came to Fengli Juegang and other places outside Wusongkou. There were about 100 ships. According to the report from the 17th team of the 4th district of the Wusong Water Police, it was a feud between the pirate leader Pan Kaiwu and another pirate leader Shen Guanxi. Therefore, they gathered in the sea off the coast to discuss peace. At that time, the peace talks failed, and the two sides were about to fight. Gong Mianqin, the captain of the 17th team, dispatched a team of ships to quickly go to suppress the disturbance after receiving the report. It is now known that Pan and Shen, the two pirate leaders, gathered in the sea off the coast for many days, and the opinions of the two sides were extremely polarized, resulting in a breakup. Shen immediately led a large number of pirate ships to attack Pan's stock, sinking nine of Pan's pirate ships and drowning more than 100 pirates. Pan was defeated by his isolated forces and retreated to the sea off Lüsi. Pan was very uneasy after suffering this heavy blow, so he gathered more than 70 pirate ships under his command on the morning of the day before yesterday and sailed to the sea off Juegang to counterattack. Shen's bandits saw that the situation was not good and retreated north without fighting. Taking advantage of the victory, Pan's bandits occupied Shayugang, which had been occupied by Shen's bandits. The homes of the residents of the upper and middle classes on land had long been evacuated. When the two pirate ships fought, bullets flew everywhere, and they were all terrified. Therefore, most of them also moved to distant places. The area was almost nine out of ten empty, which is also said to be miserable.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Question of the Trial of the Zhao Assassination Murderer <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>County Magistrate Yan submitted a request to the provincial government for verification. Xia's confession provided a total of four accomplices in the murder. The Municipal Public Security Bureau will lift the arrest and confront the former criminal. The murderer of Zhao Tieqiao, Xia Shaoen, was interrogated repeatedly by Shen Jinghua, the director of the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau. According to Xia's confession, there were a total of four accomplices in the murder of Zhao. One of them, Wang Xiaosanzi, was arrested and detained by the Municipal Public Security Bureau immediately after the assassination of Zhao. One was Xia Shaoen himself. There were still two people who had not been arrested. At this time, it was not announced. The four murderers were all instructed by someone before the assassination, and they received two-thirds of the reward in advance, tens of thousands of foreign dollars, which were collected by Wang Xiaosanzi and distributed equally to each person. They then carried two box guns, one pistol, and one six-round gun and waited in front of the China Merchants Bureau to prepare for the assassination. However, only Xia Shaoen among the four murderers knew Zhao Tieqiao, so it was decided that Xia would fire the gun. The other three protected him from the side. However, Xia Shaoen was not very familiar with the box gun he was carrying, and exchanged his pistol with Wang Xiaosanzi before shooting. He was hit. The Municipal Public Security Bureau learned that the confession of the previously arrested murderer Wang Xiaosanzi was generally the same as that of Xia Shaoen. However, there were still some discrepancies in several points, so they sent personnel to the County Public Security Bureau the day before yesterday to meet with Director Shen and requested that Xia be taken to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to confront Wang Xiaosanzi before being escorted back. Director Shen replied that this matter required a decision from the county magistrate. Therefore, he was not taken away at that time. County Magistrate Yan Shenyu resumed his duties after his leave the day before yesterday and read the confession of Xia Shaoen, the main murderer of Zhao, and the process of his arrest reported by Shen Jinghua, the director of the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, he submitted a report to the provincial government requesting instructions on the agency for hearing this case so that he could transfer it to the case for legal action. The provincial government will probably have instructions in the next few days.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Regulations on Banning Dance Hall Girls <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau issued instructions to the district chiefs yesterday, stating: "Regarding the instructions, the dance halls in this city that have been approved and licensed by this bureau have many locations. However, the number of dance hall girls who operate by dancing in each dance hall is still unknown, and it is also impossible to distinguish between these dance hall girls and non-commercial dance hall girls who dance in the same hall. It is not enough to organize and facilitate inspections without registering them. Now, this bureau has formulated thirteen regulations on the registration of commercial dance hall girls in Shanghai and attached the forms of application, registration certificates, and badges, which have been submitted to the municipal government for approval. The instructions stated that the regulations and application forms drafted by the submission and attachments have been revised by this government, and the style of the registration certificate and the style of the badge are still usable. In addition to the regulations being promulgated separately, we have copied the articles and application forms and sent them to the bureau, so that they can be followed and implemented. This order and the original attachments are stored, etc. Therefore, the necessary application forms and badges, etc., have now been prepared separately and will be registered from November 25. In addition to the announcement and distribution, the regulations have been copied and sent to the districts for uniform compliance. This order.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Tan Meiying's Request for Divorce Original Status <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Tan Meiying of Suzhou recently requested a divorce from her husband Zhao Guangzu. It was reported in a previous newspaper, but the previous newspaper did not provide detailed information. Now, we are recording the original status below. Plaintiff Tan Meiying, 22 years old, No. 8 Chunhui Lane, West Gate, Shanghai, Wuxian. Defendant Zhao Guangzu, 23 years old, No. 60 Jingxin Lane, Huade Road, Tilongqiao, Baoshan, is to state that the defendant is unable to live together and request a divorce. Statement of matters subject to judgment: (1) Request the court to order that the marriage between the defendant and the plaintiff be approved for divorce. (2) Order the defendant to bear the litigation costs. Statement of the lawsuit: The plaintiff was betrothed to the defendant by a matchmaker in childhood. Later, because the defendant was a young dandy, he easily went astray. Relatives strongly advocated marrying the plaintiff early in the hope of persuading him from the side. They were married on the 18th day of the first month of this year. However, after the plaintiff passed through the door, the defendant still indulged in prostitution and revelry, and became entangled with Concubine Mei Lao Jiu, making an engagement to marry her. In his eyes, he regarded the plaintiff as a thorn in his side. He lingered day and night, forgetting to return home and squandering his family property to the point of almost bankrupting his property. The plaintiff could not bear to see the inheritance of his grandfather and father, which came from sweat and blood, being squandered by the defendant at once. They quarreled morning and night, but unexpectedly, it aroused his anger, causing the plaintiff to be beaten repeatedly, which was witnessed by the maids. He even threatened her with a self-defense pistol, which was often dangerous. Because he loved Concubine Mei, he even wrote two letters to demand a divorce, forcing the plaintiff to end the marriage relationship. The plaintiff, burdened by the old etiquette, temporarily tolerated him to see what would happen later. Who knew that the defendant would take an inch and treat her even worse. The plaintiff, in order to cut off the fuel under the cauldron, filed a criminal lawsuit against Concubine Mei in your court in the hope that the defendant would realize his mistakes as soon as possible, but it was not too late. He was sentenced to a prison term in the case. Unexpectedly, the defendant held a grudge because of this and searched for trouble day and night without interruption. Recently, he left without saying goodbye and has been away from home for many days. It is obvious that he deliberately abandoned her and sent threatening letters, falsely claiming that he was kidnapped and demanding money. Such behavior is like a rogue. He cannot maintain a peaceful family and restore the joy of life. If he continues to abandon her like this, not only will her livelihood be affected, but also because the defendant is driven by lust, she is afraid that there will be unexpected dangers. What's more, the defendant has repeatedly expressed his intention to divorce, which shows that he has broken off relations. He has no choice but to request the dissolution of the marital relationship to extend his life. In addition to the return of the dowry, clothes, and the payment of compensation, which should be requested in another petition, he is hereby filing a petition requesting your court to order the defendant to appear in court for trial and judgment in accordance with the law. It is said that the court has approved the petition and ordered the summons.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Shanghai Commerce Gradually Recovers Its Former Appearance <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post said that Shanghai's commerce can gradually return to its usual state. The total value of imports and exports in October increased by more than 10% compared with the first nine months of this year. The value of exports reached 39 million taels, and the value of imports reached 44 million taels, which is also an increase compared with the same month last year. According to import and export merchants, the sudden boom in trade this month is largely due to the end of the war. At present, domestic finance is gradually circulating and business is gradually booming. Even in Shanghai, local trade is more prosperous than before, especially the demand for building materials and machinery. According to Gabang, the Canadian Commercial Commissioner in Shanghai, the amount of lumber shipped to Shanghai has doubled compared with previous years. Although this is largely due to the loss of lumber sales in other countries, it may not be possible to indicate the good market conditions for building materials. In addition, the amount of food shipped in has also increased significantly. For example, the amount of canned food imported in October was more than in any other month this year.</p>

<p>It is said that China's industry and commerce will have great development. Mr. Dalai, the old owner of Dalai Bank, returned to Shanghai by the Japanese post ship Haruna Maru the day before yesterday after inspecting the shipbuilding business in Hong Kong and the Philippines. He is temporarily staying at the home of Mr. Sitien, the Far East manager of the bank. After recuperating from a slight cold, he will take the President Taft on December 4 to return to the United States. Dalai visited Guangzhou when he was in Hong Kong. According to his observations, the business between the Philippines and southern China has recovered significantly, and since the situation in the rest of China has stabilized, industry and commerce will be able to develop greatly. During his stay in Shanghai, he may go to Beijing again.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Theatrical Bandits in Taixing Arrested in Shanghai <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Liu Jicheng Allowed to be Taken Away for Investigation　　Detectives Reprimanded for Unauthorized Arrest. The Judicial Police of Taixing County Government, Weng Yuan and Chen Lang, along with informant Wang Peichun, came to Shanghai to investigate and arrest the wanted criminal Liu Jicheng, a native of Taixing. The previous day, they learned that Liu was living at 752 Yulin Lane, Yangshupu. Chen immediately ordered Weng and Wang to go to the address to apprehend Liu, while he reported to the local police station for assistance. When Weng and Wang arrived at Liu's residence, they found him packing his belongings as if preparing to leave. They immediately detained Liu and handcuffed him. Soon after, Chen arrived with Chinese and foreign detectives, took Liu to the police station, and detained him until the following morning, when he was escorted to the Special District Local Court. Judge Ge conducted the trial. The police station's lawyer stated that Taixing County claimed the defendant was a communist, but the police station's search of his house yielded no communist evidence. Therefore, if the county wanted to extradite him, they should first provide proof. As Weng and Wang did not report to the police station before making the unauthorized arrest, the police station is now prosecuting them under Articles 165 and 316 of the Criminal Law and requested a trial. The Chinese and foreign detectives presented the handcuffs as evidence. Chen Lang presented the official documents from the county government, requesting permission to extradite Liu and stating that Liu Jicheng, originally named Wang Kaiyuan, was indeed a communist and had committed serious crimes of murder and arson in his hometown. Informant Wang Peichun could testify to this. Wang Peichun then testified that he knew the defendant. On July 17th of this year, bandits suddenly came to our village, numbering two or three hundred. Villagers were robbed door-to-door, and before leaving, they committed murder and arson. The bandit gang was led by the defendant. His accomplice, surnamed Wang, has already been apprehended in Taixing. Judge Ge questioned the defendant Liu Jicheng. Liu stated that he had been living in Yulin Lane in Shanghai for about two months. Before that, he was a primary school teacher in his hometown. Last year, our village was attacked by bandits, and my house was burned down. Therefore, I left my hometown to seek refuge, first in Suzhou and then in Shanghai, and so on. Judge Ge, after reviewing the testimonies, ordered that Liu Jicheng be handed over to Chen Lang, the legal police of Taixing County Government, to be taken back for trial. Subsequently, the case of Weng and Wang being accused of illegal arrest was heard. Weng and others claimed that they were new to Shanghai and did not know the regulations of the concession. Moreover, the suspect was attempting to escape at the time, so they acted in haste and requested leniency. Judge Ge, considering that the two had made procedural errors and were new to the area, reprimanded them in court and ordered that the relevant officials be notified for legal action. Chen and others, upon hearing the verdict, immediately left.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Xu Chongdao Chinese Medicine Store Held a Grand Banquet Last Night <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Grand Opening Ceremony Held Today. Mr. Xu, the owner of Xu Chongdao Chinese Medicine General Store, located west of the Niboo Bridge on Avenue Edward VII in Shanghai, observed the backwardness of modern domestic Chinese medicine. Although there are many who advocate for domestic goods, consumers still have reservations. He believes that Chinese medicine is deeply related to the national economy and people's livelihood. Therefore, he is willing to sacrifice significant capital to hire experienced teachers to compound pills, powders, plasters, and elixirs, ensuring genuine products at reasonable prices. Yesterday marked the completion of the general store's new building. Invitations were sent to representatives from the medical and pharmaceutical industries, as well as the press, to visit and provide guidance. At 6 PM, a grand banquet was held to entertain the guests. The store's general manager, Cen Zhiliang, along with Cai Jiping from the medical field, Zhang Meian from the pharmaceutical field, and Huang Yuzhai from the press, warmly welcomed and entertained the guests. Over a thousand people were present, all notable figures of the time. It is reported that prominent figures from political, military, business, and academic circles will attend the grand opening ceremony today. The official opening is scheduled for tomorrow. The store's spirit of improving Chinese medicine and striving to serve society to shake off the languid habits is commendable. In the future, when Chinese medicine is promoted and developed, the store will be a leader in the Chinese medicine industry.</p>

<p>It was further discovered that Wang Fucai and others, who were involved in another case of jointly smuggling Chinese laborers abroad (known as trafficking "yellow fish"), had been investigated and punished by the Special District Local Court for unequal distribution of profits, leading to litigation. However, one Wang He, who was also involved, had not been apprehended. The Special Court issued a warrant, and Wang, accompanied by his lawyer Fan Gang, surrendered to the police station the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the court. He stated that he was not involved in the disputes between Wang Fucai, Li Zaichen, and others at the Ningbo Hotel. However, the police station discovered that Wang had committed another crime and requested a postponement. Judge Ge ordered the defendant to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Case Against Standing Committee Member of Huajing Party Branch Dismissed <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Liu Junfu, from Huajing Town in southwestern Shanghai, was accused of being a local tyrant by the local party branch and others and was transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for trial. Unexpectedly, Liu suddenly accused Qiao Jiyuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Sixth Branch of the Second District Party Branch of Shanghai County, of false accusation in court. Qiao immediately hired lawyer Zhou Xiaoan to present a defense, arguing that Liu's accusation was based on an incorrect subject. This newspaper learned that the case has been investigated by prosecutor Yang Qi, who concluded that the case was reported by the party branch and transferred by the Shanghai County Government, not a personal claim by Qiao Jiyuan and others. Therefore, Liu's accusation was based on an incorrect subject. Prosecutor Yang Qi has dismissed the case against Qiao Jiyuan and others.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Coal Boat Crew Member Falls into River and Dies <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 7 AM, a pier boat hired by the Yitaiyong Coal Company loaded 15 tons of coal and moved into the Suzhou Creek to unload. At the same time, a stone boat followed closely behind. While passing under the Shanxi Road Bridge, the stone boat, eager to enter, suddenly crashed into the stern of the coal boat. After the coal boat was hit, the hull could not control itself and crashed into the bridge pier as well. As the bow and stern of the boats were touching, one of the crew members lost his balance and fell into the river. Neighboring boats tried to rescue him in various ways, but his body was not found. The crew member drowned. Yao Jintian, a fellow crew member, reported the incident to the Water Police Station, stating that the captain had gone to Chongming and had not returned. He himself had only been working on the boat for two weeks, so he did not know the age or name of the deceased.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Words of the Man Who Jumped into the River After Regaining Consciousness <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>His words are very strange, likely mostly untrue and incomplete. Chen Zaiyou, a 19-year-old from Taizhou, recently developed a mental illness for unknown reasons. The previous afternoon at 1 PM, he jumped into the river from the Jiangxi Road Bridge on the Suzhou Creek to commit suicide. He was rescued by the Western patrol of the Water Police Station. As reported in yesterday's newspaper, the Chen youth was sent to Renji Hospital by Wu Rongsheng, a Chinese detective from the police station. Unexpectedly, Chen struck Dr. Hu Heting on the head, tearing his sleeve. The detectives then handcuffed him and took him back to the police station. At 6 PM that evening, Wu detective escorted him to the Local Court, where he was preliminarily questioned by Prosecutor Wu. At this time, Chen was lucid, but his testimony was quite amusing. He claimed that he worked as a tea server at the Shengho Lung Oil Factory, next to the Sichuan Road Bridge and across from the Post Office. His annual salary was about 200 yuan, which was enough to make a living. One week ago, while sleeping at midnight, he suddenly dreamed of a person waving his hand up and down on his face for a long time. After waking up and recalling the dream, he felt panicked. He also thought about the frequent civil unrest in the country and worried that he would have no burial place after his death. The more he thought about it, the more frightened he became. Since then, he remained silent and expressionless. Yesterday (the day before yesterday), due to mental disorder and troubled thoughts, he went out to buy a bottle of black medicine and swallowed it. Soon after, his stomach felt extremely hot and painful. He unintentionally ran to the Jiangxi Road Bridge and jumped into the river to commit suicide. He was completely unaware of what happened after being rescued and taken to the police station. The judge suspected that his testimony was untrue and may have other reasons, so he ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, Zhu Asan, a runner from Shengho Lung Oil Factory, and Chen's uncle went to the Water Police Station requesting that Chen be released to go home. The captain ordered them to go directly to the court to check.</p>

<p>Boat Crew Member Ah Mao Dies Tragically. At 6 PM the previous night, the Yuansheng Customs Brokerage hired two pier boats to sail to the Longmao Foreign Firm's pier to load 135 barrels of tung oil. One of the boats, with Mao Xiaobao as the crew member, carried 75 barrels. After mooring for a long time, the current in the Huangpu River suddenly became rapid. The mooring ropes of Mao's boat could not hold, and they suddenly broke. The hull drifted away. Ah Mao, a crew member (19 years old), was unable to do anything. In an instant, the boat was sunk by the waves, and the tung oil was scattered and floated away. Ah Mao fell into the river. Because it was night, no one was able to rescue him, and he drowned. His body is missing. Yang Xiaozheng, the cook of the boat, returned to the boat from the shore and saw that the incident had occurred. He immediately reported it to the brokerage, which in turn reported it to the Water Police Station to find ways to salvage the body of the deceased and the scattered tung oil. However, as of yesterday evening, the body had not been found.</p>

<p>In front of the tap outside the Zhengjia Wood Bridge intersection on the Caishi Street of the French Concession, the nameless corpse of a man, about 30 or 40 years old, was found the previous morning. His clothes were tattered, and he looked like someone from a beggar's home. His body was covered with bruises. It is said that the deceased had been eating red pills, which led to poisoning and death. The patrolling police saw the body and reported it to the captain, who informed the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to send a coffin to collect the body and bury it in the public cemetery.</p>

<p>The Xu Family, a Wealthy Household, Lost Thousands of Dollars. The Next Day, Searching for Lost Items, Six People Detained. Xu Yisun, Xu Yousun, and Xu Dongsun, farmers from Zhangjiazhai, north of Pengpu Town in Baoshan, have been engaged in farming for generations. They are diligent and thrifty, and can be called the richest family in Pengpu. They live together in a two-courtyard deep residence with around 300 or 400 acres of farmland. During the Lu-Qi War, they were once looted by defeated soldiers, suffering significant losses. Unexpectedly, on the 16th night around 12 AM, dozens of bandits suddenly came, mostly speaking with a Jiangbei accent. They were wearing short clothes and carrying sharp knives and iron bars. They used a large stone to break down the gate and rushed in. By the time the whole family heard the noise and woke up, the bandits had closed in. Four bandits guarded outside, yelling with weapons, while the rest entered and ransacked the house. All seven rooms were emptied. Even the earrings, gold hairpins, and gold rings on the women's heads were taken. The loss of clothes, ornaments, and money was no less than several thousand dollars. Dongsun's son and his wife tried to escape to report to the police, but they were beaten on the head and face with sharp knives and iron bars, causing blood to flow freely. His son took the opportunity to escape through the back door, crossed the pool river, and blew the police whistle and shouted to catch the robbers. The bandits then howled and fled. By the time the nearby security team arrived with guns to arrest them, the bandits had already escaped far away. The next day at noon, three young men with disheveled clothes and strange behavior wandered around their house and lingered in the grass around the house, seemingly looking for lost items. Yisun and others, seeing this, became suspicious and followed them to Pengpu Town and reported them to the police. All six were detained. Yisun and others believed that there must be a reason for them to wander around the grass, so they went to check and found a flashlight in the grass. This item must have been lost by the bandits and they came to find it. They also reported it to the Pengpu Public Security Bureau substation for investigation.</p>

<p>A Good Marriage Achieved. Guo Rugen, an 18-year-old from Chaozhou, has been working as an apprentice in a dyeing and weaving factory on McGon Road. Last year, through the introduction of a friend, he met a Wang girl, Ruifang. Wang, 28 years old, is beautiful and originally from Dinghai. She often came to Shanghai with her mother to visit relatives living at a certain address in Xianyi Lane on Xin Chongqing Road. Guo, taking advantage of his proximity, often visited her during his spare time, or went out with her. Therefore, cinemas and game venues in Shanghai often had their footprints. Since they met, the two have been very affectionate and close. Initially, they were able to maintain a friendly relationship. However, on a certain night in mid-June, Guo invited the girl to meet at the Beijing Grand Theatre. They whispered sweet words and were extremely happy. After the movie ended, they stayed overnight at the Central Hotel. The girl was bound by love and could not refuse. That night, she lost her virginity. Three days later, after the girl returned to her relative's house, she was severely questioned by her mother. The girl was ashamed and almost committed suicide. Later, through the persuasion of relatives and friends, she realized that what was done could not be undone and should not be publicized. Therefore, she sent someone to the Guo family to get things done, so that the event can be consummated. However, Guo's parents firmly opposed it. Their son was willing to keep his promise to wait until he could support himself and had enough money to marry her. The girl's mother, in order to make things happen, agreed to lend several hundred dollars for the wedding expenses. However, Guo's parents were still stubborn and refused. Therefore, the woman was furious and hired lawyer Tian Heming last week to send a letter of warning to Guo's parents, instructing them to indicate the definite date of the marriage within this week, otherwise, she would file a criminal lawsuit in court. Guo's family was terrified after receiving the letter and quickly sent someone to Wang's house to beg for peace. It is now known that the two sides have reached an agreement. The Guo family will marry the Wang girl within the month. A lawsuit has disappeared without a trace. From then on, enemies became relatives.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Buying a Compulsory Loan Involves a Lawsuit <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Huang Dingzhu hired a lawyer to represent him in the French Concession Civil Court yesterday, stating that the plaintiff was previously a comprador at the Gonghe Steamboat Company. Because he was often ill, he replaced the defendant Wang Yunruo as comprador. At that time, the defendant did not have any cash, so Wang issued two loan notes totaling more than 10,000 yuan, stating the agreed repayment date. When the loan came due, he demanded payment but was ignored. Recently, it was discovered that the defendant wanted to transfer the position to Gao Wenbin, intending to abscond with the money. Therefore, he requested a special request to arrest the defendant and demand strict recovery of the funds. He now presents the loan note for appraisal. Wang Yunruo confessed that although the plaintiff had replaced him as comprador, he had never changed his name. Moreover, the merchant had previously advanced more than 10,000 yuan to the plaintiff, so he did not pay it back. If the plaintiff immediately changed the name of the comprador, the merchant would immediately pay. According to the merchant's calculations, the plaintiff owed the merchant a large sum of money and had to compensate the merchant for all losses. He requested to be released so that he could submit the evidence. Judge Gong ordered the defendant to provide a personal surety or a cash bail and be released pending further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e179">Receipt for Tobacco License Exempt from Stamp Duty <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Error by Inspector. The Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Association sent a letter to the North and South City Offices regarding the exemption of stamp duty for temporary receipts for licenses. The letter stated: To Whom It May Concern: Regarding the case of the temporary receipts for tobacco licenses temporarily received by members of the association from the Jiangxi Second District Tobacco License Tax Collection Office being exempt from stamp duty, this association previously received a letter from Xiangcheng, a member company forwarded by the South City Office, requesting negotiation, which has been strongly argued. On the 15th of this month, we received a reply from the Jiangsu Shangbao Stamp Duty Bureau, stating that they have approved the association's letter stating that a member company, Xiangcheng, reported that a temporary receipt for a tobacco license was found by an inspector from the Shangbao Stamp Duty Bureau to have no stamp duty affixed and that the receipt was taken to the bureau for verification and return. The bureau considered that the temporary receipt was issued by the Tobacco and Alcohol License Collection Office for exchanging for a formal license and was not a deliberate omission of stamp duty. The inspector may have misunderstood and should be investigated and exempted, and the receipt should be returned. The bureau has already informed the bureau that this is not a formal tobacco and alcohol license, but a temporary receipt for applying for a license, and it is not a item to be affixed with stamp duty. The bureau has instructed the inspector to return it to the company on the same day to facilitate business, and has instructed all inspectors to be informed. In the future, this type of receipt will be exempt from investigation and deduction. If other merchants have similar receipts that have been mistakenly taken by inspectors to the bureau, they will be investigated and returned at any time after verification. The bureau's approval letter has been forwarded, and we hope that you will check and inquire with Xiangcheng whether the receipt has been returned to clarify the facts. On the same day, the bureau received a letter from your office requesting that members of the Nine Acres Land Company, Defeng, etc., have also experienced this situation and requesting further negotiation. Upon investigation, the inspectors clearly violated the bureau's orders and attempted to extort money. Except for the Dongjiadu Wanchang license, which was deducted due to negligence and omission of stamp duty, which should be handled separately, we will first forward the original letter from the bureau to all fellow tradesmen for response. Please check and handle it and, according to the items opened in the bureau's letter, contact the relevant offices to quickly negotiate the return of the deducted temporary receipts to clarify the original case and avoid disputes. In the meantime, the handling situation should still be reported at any time as it is necessary.</p>

The Shanghai County Medical and Pharmaceutical Association, the student self-governing associations of county-run junior high schools and rural normal schools, and chambers of commerce in Beiqiao, Maqiao, and other places have all been investigated and approved by the department, and licenses have been issued. Zhou Bangjian, Lü Juefei, and others have been appointed as organizational instructors for the respective organizations. Starting from the 14th of this month, Department Head Han Rongling and staff member Zhou Bangjian personally went to various townships to investigate and provide guidance on the organization of various groups, and to explain the doubts about the newly promulgated regulations. They only returned to the committee last night. It is learned that although the department has repeatedly postponed the general registration of party ideology teachers in the county, the number of reporters coming to the department to register is still small. During this inspection of mass organizations, the department brought various registration forms to the schools for detailed investigation, and also conveniently inspected the implementation of party ideology education at all levels of the police. It is reported that the department plans to conduct an examination of party ideology education in the county together with the County Education Bureau and conduct single-level school party ideology tests in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="e197">Shanghai's Latest Automobile Statistics <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Gan</p>
<p>Optimistic Outlook, Daily Improvements</p>
<p>After the sweltering heat of August, Shanghai's commerce gradually improved. In mid-September, the situation in various industries was better. As October arrived, the number of people inquiring about automobiles increased daily, and sales also improved daily. In particular, the development of the automobile industry by the Chinese people is the greatest. Automobile dealers in Shanghai have seen increasing sales and orders. From now until Christmas, there is reason to be optimistic. The number of automobiles registered in the autumn increased by 408, which shows that the business is still good. What is even more special is that many automobiles have been sold to the interior. For example, one brand of automobile is an excellent example of high-end automobiles. There are not many in the Shanghai area, but the dealer of this car said that more than 40 units were sold in mid-September, and there will be more transactions in the future.</p>
<p>Two automobile dealers also said that the demand for used cars in the market exceeds the supply. Once this ends, the outlet for new cars will inevitably be better. A dealer of Continental automobiles said that he has 40 new models of automobiles that have already been shipped to Shanghai and are on the way. Another batch of similar numbers is also planned to be shipped soon. As for the three types of American-made automobiles, Buick, Chrysler, and Studebaker, with eight cylinders, they have been on display in Shanghai for several weeks. Among them, the new Studebaker Free Wheel is especially attracting attention. With Shanghai's wealth, the status of multi-cylinder automobiles will naturally increase daily. Judging from the attached table, the number of automobile sales has not increased significantly, but the number of Riley, Wolseley, Morris, Whippet, and Willis is particularly high. Soon these companies will make further announcements. The number of automobile registrations in the third quarter of this year increased by 408 compared to the same period last year. It is particularly important to note that Shanghai automobile dealers not only operate in Shanghai, but also sell automobiles to Nanjing, Hangzhou, and even Hankou. The number of passenger cars increased by 101 in the Public Concession and 111 in the French Concession. As for the number of freight cars increased, the number of registrations in both the Public Concession and the French Concession on October 1 was 111 more than on July 1. The rest is the increase in motorcycles.</p>
<p>American-made automobiles still maintain their superior position. Although European-made automobiles have acceleration boosters and strive to compete in terms of price, they are still not very helpful. Among the 23 brands, 16 of those with more than 100 cars are made in the United States, four are from the United Kingdom, two are from France, one is from Italy, and one is a Feixiatuo. If we look at each automobile separately, Buick, which has been a leader for many years, still ranks first. The number of more than 1,000 cars is unprecedented in the history of Shanghai automobiles. There are currently 1,004 Buicks. Ford, a long-established automobile, ranks second, with the number of cars increasing every quarter. Currently, there are 940. Including trucks, there are a total of 1,652 Ford automobiles in the Shanghai Concession. This number is comparable to the number of Fords in American cities with similar populations to Shanghai. The combined sales of Chevrolet automobiles rank second, while the number of automobiles ranks third. There are a total of 961 Chevrolet automobiles and trucks in Shanghai. Among the automobiles manufactured in the United Kingdom, Morris Riley is the most numerous, with 526 units. Feixiatuo ranks second among Continental-made automobiles, with 505 units. Citroen and Austin rank third and fourth. Studebaker ranks above these two. See the table below for details.</p>

<p>The two attached photos are of the earliest products of the British Rolls-Royce automobile factory, dating back to 1904, twenty-one years ago. One of these two automobiles has a two-cylinder engine, and the other has a four-cylinder engine. Both were displayed at the Paris Motor Show and were considered the most beautiful automobiles of their time. One of them continuously traveled 220 miles in a single day without any difficulties. The Rolls-Royce automobile factory is the most famous high-end automobile manufacturer in England, producing extremely exquisite products, but only manufacturing the machinery and not the car body. The selling price is very high, with each set of machinery costing over 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Characteristics of Goodyear Aviation Tires <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>How magnificent is the aviation industry! The development of transportation, the dissemination of news, the infusion of culture, the conduct of military affairs, and all other issues concerning national economy and people's livelihood mostly benefit from it directly or indirectly. Because of this, the aviation industry is increasingly valued by the world, and the issue of aviation safety is becoming increasingly important and urgently needs to be resolved by the world. In recent times, the efforts of various countries to promote the aviation industry and the exhaustive research and improvements by major manufacturers to enhance aviation safety all stem from a deep understanding of its significant importance, compelling them to spare no effort to continuously improve and achieve perfection.</p>
<p>The invention of Goodyear aviation tires is another new method to promote aviation safety and another great success of the company. Goodyear Rubber Company is one of the world's largest rubber factories, renowned globally for its robust strength, excellent products, magnificent scale, and comprehensive equipment. The company's innovative plans and numerous initiatives are particularly astonishing and admired by the world. This time, the company has focused its efforts on enhancing aviation safety, devoting its attention to meticulous research and development, ultimately leading to the invention of this new tire. Its structure, construction, and design are fundamentally innovative. Its functional characteristics aim to make aircraft takeoffs and landings safer. Its naming as the Goodyear aviation tire is due to the direct mounting of a full-volume pneumatic tire core onto the wheel hub. Thus, the rim, spokes, and wheel can all be eliminated. This combines the functions of both tire and wheel. Who would say its name is inappropriate?</p>
<p>The features of the tire-wheel are numerous, the most prominent being the valuable auxiliary shock absorber that can be eliminated, naturally increasing the load-carrying capacity. Landings are exceptionally stable, and the traction is particularly strong. Even when encountering ice, snow, or mud, the operation is very natural and has absolutely no impact on stability. Therefore, the usual ground equipment is not necessary here. When landing in windy conditions, it is even safer. Not only that, the aviation tire-wheel has a larger air capacity with the lowest pressure, so it can handle heavy loads under normal usage conditions. This has been verified through various tests. The tire core is placed on a specially made wheel hub. The internally expanding brake wheel can be installed or not, as desired, which is the same as the standard design. When an aircraft is equipped with this new type of aviation tire-wheel, landing is smooth and comfortable, with no jarring, and passengers can hardly discern when the aircraft touches the ground. Thus, the life of the aircraft can be extended. What is particularly noteworthy is that an aircraft equipped with aviation tire-wheels takes off more easily and requires less effort than one equipped with high-pressure tires. This is because it can still maintain contact with the ground through the tire's force when ascending two to five inches. Therefore, all obstacles on the ground are fully absorbed by the tire itself, and the aircraft's progress is not affected in the slightest. With these various advantages, the brisk sales of Goodyear aviation tire-wheels are undoubtedly predictable.</p>
<p>The various parts of the aircraft frame are free from the danger of damage or breakage. The reason why this type of tire-wheel can clearly absorb shocks and avoid bouncing is because of its low pressure and large air capacity. Even if there are shocks, they are dissipated in its larger air capacity. Furthermore, the cross-sectional diameter of the tire-wheel is particularly long compared to its height, so it naturally has the effect of a flat or webbed foot when landing, and the fuselage touching the ground or accumulated snow is also safer and without danger. High-pressure tires, on the other hand, may be prone to impact and other problems.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Buick Construction (Continued) <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ren</p>
<p>Increasingly Solid</p>
<p>Buick cars have gained the trust of the world because of their solid construction. Buick is a sturdy and durable car that provides reliable long-term service. The new 1931 Buick is even more capable of handling difficult tasks. Buick engineers are unwilling to reduce the car's weight easily, focusing on delivering sufficient power. The new chassis matches the new straight-eight-cylinder engine. All the major features of this year's new car, such as the sealed chassis, the entire powertrain, the driveshaft, and the pressed steel frame, are still preserved. The road handling of cars without a chassis has improved. The car body is solid and vibration-free, the chassis is stable, and the ride is comfortable. The chassis and body are made as one and have been tested on thousands of miles of rough roads. The frame is particularly sturdy, with a central heavy cross member. The size and strength of other cross members have also been increased. Heavy cross members are only found on expensive cars.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Talks on Road Administration in Beijing and Shanghai <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Fei</p>
<p>Among the road administration issues nationwide, Shanghai ranks first, followed by Nanjing. Since Shanghai became a treaty port through the Sino-British Treaty, the concession areas have been gradually developed. The widening of roads, the solidity of roadbeds, the acquisition of houses, and the traffic of vehicles have a history of over eighty years and are still progressing daily. Even in the Chinese areas of Zhabei and Nanshi, active efforts are being made without reservation. Moreover, since the success of the Northern Expedition and the change to a special municipality, even more attention has been paid to road construction, such as the reconstruction of the Dongmen street with asphalt pavement, attention to sidewalks, and the return of vehicles from Ximen. In the three years since then, the achievements have been no less than those of the concessions. As for Nanjing, it is not so. The narrow and dilapidated streets, the obstructed and uneven road surfaces, the uneven heights of houses, and the muddy and slippery conditions after rain are undeniable. However, since the establishment of the National Government in Nanjing as the capital of China and a model city, the above-mentioned undesirable urban appearances should naturally be actively improved. Among them, Zhongshan Avenue directly reaches Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and various road traffic is expected to be unified. Although it is not enough to compare with Shanghai, the model area is observed by both Chinese and foreigners, and it relies on the attention of the municipal authorities. How should the uneven road surfaces be made smooth? How should the narrow streets be widened? How should the inconvenient traffic be made rapid? How should the accidents caused by vehicles be reduced? It can be established as a rule for other places to follow and imitate. The issues of main roads, roadbed construction, selection of road construction materials, land acquisition and compensation, traffic signals, streetcars, and buses in Beijing and Shanghai are discussed separately below, with the intention of assisting others.</p>
<p>Main Roads in the City Whether the traffic in a city is developed depends on the prior determination of the main roads. Shanghai and Nanjing have successively measured and prepared detailed maps of the main roads in the city. The Shanghai concessions and the Public Works Department have accurate maps of the main roads in the city. The navigation of ports and the widening of streets are all detailed in advance and announced to the public. Citizens can formulate their own plans in accordance with the plans of the Public Works Department without hindering the city's plan to freely construct houses. If the main road is too narrow, the development of the city cannot meet the needs of traffic. If the main road is too wide, the waste of land is also very regrettable. Both Beijing and Shanghai have taken note of the concessions'</p>
<h2>Page 27</h2>
<p>determination of main road plans and have prepared detailed maps of the main roads in the city for public access.</p>
<p>Roadbed Construction If the roadbed is strong, heavy vehicles can travel. If the roadbed is weak, the road surface is easily damaged. Therefore, the Shanghai concessions' Public Works Department builds very thick roadbeds on all roads, with ten shichen or more being the most common. Even if there are many vehicles or many heavy vehicles, the road surface will not be damaged. Except for the existing roads, all newly built roads in Shanghai are also ten shichen or more. Zhongshan Road in Nanjing is also around ten shichen. The roadbed stones in both Beijing and Shanghai are generally large stone blocks, so even with many vehicles and frequent heavy vehicles, they can bear the weight. In areas where commerce and industry are developed, there are more heavy vehicles than elsewhere, and the roadbeds should be thickened accordingly. In administrative and residential areas, where there are fewer heavy vehicles, the roadbeds may be slightly thinner.</p>
<p>Selection of Materials The selection of road construction materials is also an important project, and asphalt roads are the most important. Asphalt roads are recognized as the most suitable road construction material in cities around the world. The Shanghai concessions have gradually converted stone roads to asphalt pavement. Although construction takes time and is more expensive, asphalt pavement is smooth and easy to clean, saving maintenance costs. Therefore, all new roads in Beijing and Shanghai are built with asphalt as the standard. Existing roads are also gradually repaired and repaved with asphalt. However, asphalt is not produced in China and must be purchased from overseas, increasing costs. It is said that the Kaiyuan Coal Mine Company manufactures a type of paving brick specifically for road construction. It is unknown whether this type of paving brick is suitable and is also a question for research. However, for the sake of reclaiming rights, it may be adopted and tested.</p>
<p>Land Acquisition and Compensation Providing reasonable land prices for land requisitioned is a fair method. In Shanghai, in addition to relocation expenses, land prices are paid in accordance with the Land Requisition Law, but at the same time, a road construction fee is levied based on the unearned increment in value. It is said that the construction cost of Zhongshan Road in Beijing is about 700,000 yuan, while demolition and land costs require tens of thousands of yuan. Therefore, land should be acquired with reasonable compensation, and at the same time, a road construction fee should be levied so that the rights and obligations of citizens are fair. It is said that Hangzhou, Hankou, and Guangzhou are following the same methods as Beijing and Shanghai.</p>
<p>Traffic Signals Traffic signals must have red and green lights. Red indicates stop, and green indicates go. This is a common traffic device used in cities around the world to direct vehicles and pedestrians. In Shanghai, where the population is increasing and traffic is complex, many of these traffic signals have been added. The Public Concession installed these lights first, and they were quite convenient. The French Concession also followed suit. This is nothing more than to reduce vehicle accidents. Vehicle accidents are unavoidable, but these lights reduce them slightly. However, they are only useful at intersections and three-way junctions on checkerboard-style streets. They are not necessary on winding streets. Therefore, although the Shanghai Municipal Government has been established for three years, it has installed few of these signal lights because the roads are mostly winding. After the construction of Zhongshan Road in Nanjing, traffic is concentrated on this road, and the municipal authorities have also installed these signal lights to ensure traffic safety. However, they are made of Chinese materials, and the style and candlepower are very weak, which is a shortcoming.</p>
<p>Streetcars and Automobiles Streetcars require tracks and overhead wires. Trackless streetcars have wires but no tracks. Buses do not require tracks or wires. The auto repair shops can be large or small. Therefore, the capital for streetcars must be strong and the scale must be large. Starting a bus company does not require much funding. When changes to routes are needed, a simple announcement is sufficient. The Shanghai concessions and urban areas have both streetcars and buses. Nanjing has long established a bus company, and streetcars are still being planned. However, the materials for streetcars must be purchased from Europe and the United States, and the equipment is very complex. Operating buses is easy, but the gasoline must be supplied by foreign countries, and the outflow of money is unbearable. In addition to the two concessions, the Shanghai Municipal Government has a Chinese-owned streetcar company operating on Zhonghua Road, Minguo Road, Gaochangmiao, and the Shiliupu Road. There is also the Hu-Min-Nan Tuo Bus Company operating on the Hu-Nan to Minhang line and the Hu-Nan Bus Company operating on the Nanshi and Zhabei lines. However, in recent years, the exchange rate has soared, and the price of automobiles has suddenly increased. It is proposed to increase fares to compensate for the losses. However, with the precedent of streetcars, the first increase in business was affected. I believe that Shanxi's oil wells are very rich and should be developed to supply domestic bus operators and reclaim rights.</p>
<p>All of the above are the most important aspects of road administration in Beijing and Shanghai. In short, our country has rarely paid attention to road administration. Since the establishment of the Shanghai concessions, people in our country have begun to realize that road administration is closely related to culture and transportation. Therefore, in recent years, cities and towns have built roads to facilitate automobile traffic and speed up travel. However, road administration issues are not easy to discuss. Our country has few scientific inventions, and industry is not developed. Not to mention that asphalt is imported, streetcar motors are purchased from abroad, and our country merely calls for building roads to facilitate transportation, unknowingly creating more profit opportunities and sales outlets for foreigners. How can we not be saddened when we think of this? Therefore, although I describe the road administration in Beijing and Shanghai as a reference for other places, I hope that: 1. Automobile manufacturing plants can be established in the country; 2. Oil wells in Shanxi Province can be developed; 3. Science can be studied in detail to manufacture streetcar motors; 4. Other suitable road construction materials besides asphalt can be found. There must be those who sympathize with this statement.</p>

<p>Hudson automobiles have achieved results year after year. This year, the Polish Championship was won for the 19th time. This year, no fewer than one hundred and dozens of cars joined the competition, competing for nine days, comparing engine power and the various advantages of the car body style. As a result of the evaluation, the Hudson Large Eight-Cylinder was the most beautiful and perfect. This is said to be the first victory in European automobile competitions.</p>

<h3 id="e205">The World's Longest Automobile Road <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Running Directly Through North and South America - 15,000 Miles Long</p>
<p>According to news recently received from the United States, the California Automobile Association has decided to build the Inter-American Highway. All implementation methods are currently in place. The United States, its various states, North America's Alaska, and South America's Argentina are cooperating to connect North and South America. Once this road is completed, it will be the world's longest automobile road. The road will pass through California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, Burns, and South to Mexico and Central America along the Pacific coast and enter South America. The length of the route is rare and can be considered the world's longest automobile road. Since this news came out, governments in North and South America have been happy to support the early completion of this road. The border between British Columbia and Alaska is being planned. According to news from the United States, an office will be set up in Panama to connect various provinces and districts in Central America, measure routes, and discuss everything. This will be very convenient for the implementation. In the current situation, not only the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America are working hard, but also the government of the Republic of Argentina at the southern tip of South America is also striving to promote the implementation. According to news from official circles, the Argentine government has decided to first build a road across the Andes Mountains from Buenos Aires to Santiago, Chile, to Santiago, Chile, which is the center of the South American automobile road. This plateau road will be able to pass directly along the Pacific coast to Alaska and the provinces of North America, and the west coast of South America will also be able to reach Chile directly. Therefore, once this road is completed, the convenience of transportation between North and South America will be self-evident.</p>
<p>Amid these preparations, the US government has decided to allocate 50,000 gold yuan to measure the routes in various provinces in Central America. The Inter-American Highway Committee, which convened a meeting in Panama in mid-October last year, has been appointed by the US government to study the route, and the US Construction Committee will assist in all aspects of the measurement. The countries where the measurement is carried out must provide appropriate assistance to facilitate the process. Countries such as Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Panama have formally expressed their willingness to assist in all aspects. When the Inter-American Highway is built in places where there are no roads, new roads must be built. Narrow roads in northern Canada and Alaska that can only be used by pack animals must be widened and rebuilt.</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>There are two automobile groups in California that are cooperating: the California Automobile Association and the Southern California Automobile Club. British Columbia has good roads that can be extended to reach Canada, such as Revelstoke, Hope, and Fernie. During this road construction, officials from various countries and important figures in the automotive industry have met several times. The Yukon Territory of British Columbia, which is the only way for international automobiles, is also the plateau road along the Pacific coast. Four hundred miles will be built first, and construction will begin soon. Expedition members also held a formal meeting in Canada to decide on implementation methods to connect the routes in California, Oregon, and Washington. In fact, Alaska is almost an island nation, because there is no road for domestic transportation. In addition to steamships and transportation with the United States, automobiles cannot reach it. Once the Inter-American Highway is completed, all parts of the far north will be accessible, and Alaska will be especially convenient. The road is 15,000 miles long, starting from Fairbanks, Alaska in the north and reaching Santiago, Chile in the south. The length of the entire road is rare. We cannot help but regard it as a dream. However, Mexico, California, and other places have already started measuring, and the year of completion is not far away. We can wait and see.</p>
