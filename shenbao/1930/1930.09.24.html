<h3>德政局之前途</h3>
<p>德國亦爲多黨政治其所以共和十年以來能保持合作之精神政黨基礎日漸穏固者由於政府黨運用聯絡手段之適宜也政府黨之所以運用聯絡適宜者以其時左右兩極端黨勢力尙未大顯而其他與黨易於聮合也以故數年以來政黨間雖不能一無惡感然此黨與彼黨間尙不致有火拼不相容之狀態即在政局摇動時亦無劇烈紊亂騷動不安之象此德政府所以常賴其力以維持於各派競爭間也自今次選舉而後形勢又將大變矣現政府之中央黨即推倒前政府之社會民主黨而代興者也以情勢言中央黨與社會民主黨當然不易合作即令覺悟目前形勢非合作不可而勉强携手尙未必能佔多數故又非拉攏一極端派不可然拉攏左派耶則右派必將連合他黨以反抗拉攏右派耶則左派又必連合他黨以示敵已覺左右之爲難况乎今日德國所處之地位甚爲重要外交上之關係更多聯左聯右於國際間均生重大影響故德政府於此不能僅顧内部結合之便利而漫然與任何一派結合必須斟酌乎歐陸外交之情勢熟權乎世界大局之利害而後决定方針與之携手此又德政府今日之先務也苟其不然而漫然與之結合則其所生影響豈僅國内之不安而已哉</p>
<p>自來小國介乎兩大之問事齊事楚固甚爲難然其政府苟能善於交際亦可偷息苟安於一時若今日德政黨介乎不相容之兩大黨則有非兩面敷衍之手段所能爲力者所處地位之困難誠爲今日世界所鮮見矣</p>

<h3>中學經常費分配問卷</h3>
<p>敎育部欲知各地學校經常費實際狀况以便規定普通中學經常費分配標準特頒發中學經常費分配問卷通令江蘇等第十四省敎育廳及行政院直轄五市敎育局云現在各地學校往往因爲經費不足敎師待遇微薄敎學設備簡陋發生了許多困難問題財力艱難這固然是辦學困難的主要原因但經費的如何分配也和辦學的成績很有關係同一數量的經費分配的適當與否便顯有敷用與支絀的區别了</p>
<p>學校爲敎學之地他的經費自然都應用於敎學上而所以爲敎學者一爲導師一爲工具所以學校的經費照合理的分配大部分自然是敎師的俸薪小部分便應用於圖書儀器·一切科學及工作的設備和種種實騐的消耗方面極小一部分才係學校必需的辦公費這樣敎學的效率方能充實而宏大而經費也不至於虚糜了可是現在一般的情形敎學的設備和實騐所占的經費額非常之小視辦公費相差甚遠學生除讀幾本敎科書外閱覽的圖書是很少的科學的經騐是很不完備的一切工作的設備是極其簡陋或者甚至没有的結果青年對學術的興趣異常淡薄而對於科學探討的慾望更絶對不會發生了影響所及邪說宣傳便乘虚而入現在青年誤入歧途者所以日見增多辦學者的本身先自腐敗也是很大的原因本部現在打算規定普通中學經常費分配標準以資校正但須先知道各地學校經常費分配的實際狀部以資參證所以頒發一種調查中學經常費分配問卷仰該「廳」「局」轉發公立及已立案之私立各中學遵照塡答於文到一個月内由該廳局經彙送來部是爲至要（中學經常費分配問卷續登）</p>

<h3>一得之言</h3>
<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>毎個男子有三隻手一隻手要錢一隻手要女人一隻手要名譽女子們也有三隻手一隻手要快活一隻手要裝飾一隻手要性命</p>
<p>現代的母親和父親一樣的不能常在家裏逢見伊了你離開了伊就不見你要伊時也不在</p>
<p>有許多女子嫁了一個男子之後希望做一個他的嚮導他的哲學家他的一個好朋友可是實際上只做了他的一隻閙鐘他的食品檢騐員他的管家人</p>
<p>新婚的男女度過了蜜月以後其最要緊的一回事就是應該用了細細的網兒罩住了他們預防着他俩預料中的希望乘隙逸去</p>
<p>男性美的基本在他的人格在他的剃頭店在他的衣着在他的保安剃刀</p>
<p>已婚男女間之最大危險其原因總不出下列兩端第一端是由於男的錯誤第二端是由於女的過失</p>
<p>男子們的心中不能有二個相反的思想除非這是二個膚色不同而又是絶頂美麗的女子</p>
<p>一枚定婚戒與一枚結婚戒相差極大其差異之點好像一張期票和一張鈔票</p>
<p>假使你不幸而失戀了那末你不必到别處去找尋理由只要拿一面鏡子定一回神照一照尊容摸一摸錢袋</p>
<p>戀愛之於女子好像看一本神奇的小說一樣熱烈地要看到他的結果然而戀愛之於男子却會不管他的結果如何兩滿足於現在的情形和現在的快活</p>

<h3>由虫害推測美棉之收成</h3>
<p>一千四百萬包似可認爲低數</p>
<p>美棉收成之豐歉固視天氣之變化爲斷然果虫害之輕重亦有密切之關係即虫害重收成歉輕則豐雖有時虫害較重因天氣之補救而尙無重大影響故天氣與虫害實爲棉産豐歉之主要原素也據最近二十年間政府棉産報告與虫害百分率以一九二○年虫害最輕爲百分之一·三收量爲二○七·七磅一九二一年虫害最重爲百分之三一·二收量僅一二四·五磅故果虫之損害及天氣之適宜與否同爲一般人所注意也本季（一九三○三一年）天氣亢旱惟據各方報告棉區並3無重大影響而虫害消息當無所聞九月八日政府公報本年果虫害以氣候比較乾燥僅及百分之四·一與一九二五年相同而一九二五年亦以天氣之變化收成爲一六七·二磅超過十年間平均收量幾及十磅查本年棉田爲四五八一五○○○畝比上季减百分之二·七此項數字中尙包含廢田畝數在内據八日政府報告本季廢田率爲百分之二·二視歷年爲少推算實收數字爲四四七九一○○○畝一六七·二磅之收量本季似屬不可能之事如以十年平均數一五八磅推算産量約爲一千四百十五萬四千包若以最近二年之毎畝平均産量一六○磅（一九二九年爲一六二·一一九二八年爲一五九·六）推算約爲一千四百三十三萬三千包此數字與三次政府估計數字極近此後氣候若無激變此數字比較的爲確當而一五八磅似可認爲低的數字也一千四百萬包之産額雖不爲豐然在目前棉業趨向　敗之際殊有供給過剩之虞棉市在低峯盤旋而不易趨舠者以此故欲求棉市之穏定端賴如何消弭此大量之生産至人爲的强定市價似非根本辦法也</p>

<h3>標粉跌勢猛更</h3>

<h3>期麥續跌三四分</h3>

<h3>活埋管毛大案</h3>
<p>侯根寶否認謀殺</p>
<p>兩證人供稱不知</p>
<p>檢察官論告意旨</p>
<p>廿七日下午宣判</p>
<p>蘇州快信上海侯根贊活埋表弟管毛大一案蘇高法院昨（二十三）下午三時傳到關係人管劉坤及發現屍身所在田旁棚戸王早豐即王昭福侯根寶姊丈李福田等續開辯論庭由刑三庭長黄炳道推事趙鉦鏜兩人審問結果當庭辯論終結定期本月二十七日下午宣判分紀如后</p>
<p>侯根寶供開庭後先提侯根寶訊問供與上次庭訊略同次訊原告管劉坤供伊子毛大之死確爲根寶活埋無疑當初八日下午三時根寶至我家一行後即怱怱而去顯係潛逃其赴姊丈李福田家中意圖匿居李家至於根寶託說謂「我託伊赴滬找尋毛大」一語又屬不符緣初八日毛大出外未歸後我僅託許阿桂出外找尋並未託根寶赴滬</p>
<p>王早豐供證人王早豐供毎日早晨三時許出外拉車至午刻十二時交班歸家至下午三時即睡故對毛大屍身發現事實不知情（問）你家有多少人（答）妻子等共五人（問）妻子在家否（答）大人均在外面田門種田祇有小孩在家（問）種誰家的田（答）是向姓蔡的租來耕種離屍身發現所在不遠但看不見（問）你所住草棚之旁有其他草棚否（答）附近没有（問）毛大屍身在墳旁掘出你家近在咫尺究竟知道否（答）初實不知直到後來大家去看方始知道（問）那時候田間的麥有多少高（答）約二尺多高（問）你們走到家裡要經過墳旁否（答）不經過的因爲走小路的供至此侯根寶之辯護律師朱樹楨起立謂應請庭上詢王早豐以初八之事於是黄庭長續問初八日你何時出門（答）早上三時出去午刻十二時歸家吃飯後至三點鐘即睡覺到了夜半再出去的（問）你不知曉墳旁發現毛大屍身你妻種田時有無知道（答）我妻種田時也没知道</p>
<p>李福田供次訊李福田供侯根寶是我内弟毛大是内表弟初九日下午三時根寶到我家時我不在家内後來根寶即去找尋至四時根寶之兄可必來說起毛大屍身在墳旁掘出故我即赴管家當夜住在管家等到初十返家後始知根寶當夜是住在我家的到晚上根寶又來因聽到警局拘去伊母央我陪他往警局看母行至交通路因經路人指認遂爲石巡長將根寶拘去至是趙推事（問）警區裡你進去未進去（答）没有進去我祇到門外（問）審問情形你没看見（答没有看見）（問）你家離管劉坤家有多少遠（答）約七八里（問）離侯根寶家（答）祗四五里至是再問侯根寶你在四區已供明謀殺管毛大何以今天又翻供（答）因爲當時他們用利逼供的（問）可有傷痕可當庭騐明（答）日子已多傷痕已看不見</p>
<p>檢察論告次由金檢察官起立論告略謂查本案被告侯根寶前在警所内已經供明與管彩弟商量活埋毛大今在本院兩次庭訊則謂警所中用刑逼供又謂傷痕已無顯見此種自由之詞不足採取而本案兇物如木錐鐵棍兩項係在被告家中搜出此足證明爲本案中之行兇器具但侯根寶與彩弟因何原因而致死毛大年僅十三歲幼稚之年又何必置之於死查閱案卷毛大與彩弟係兩母所生彩弟年長或覬覦財産下此毒手據是以觀起意究竟屬於何人尙難證明故本案處刑問題尙有斟酌之處</p>
<p>律師辯論繼由朱律師辯護請注意五點（一）木錐鐵剷在公安局時謂係母舅家之物管劉坤則不認家中有此物侯阿坤與上訴人素有仇嫌兩物係阿坤所取出其報告當然不足憑信（二）地保與原告係一姓所稱毛大諒必候根寶弄死諒必二字係推測語氣（三）彩弟爲紗廠女工素情放浪與根寶發生姦情一節原告及鄰人均否認故此案彩弟不到案不能定讞（四）地院楊警長調查時有錢鑑周等說根寶弄死毛大云云並無人看見且土坑深有四尺長亦四尺非短時間所能掘成（五）初九日根寶尙與許阿桂赴戈登路及靜安寺兩捕房報告毛大失踪又根寶被拘係自投警所尋母且原告原無財産上訴人謀財云云亦不成立末由庭長諭本案定二十七日下午宣判退庭</p>

<p>綱目云勞瘵又名傳尸病（即肺癆）人死後復易家親一人故曰傳尸亦名傳　其病自上注下與前人相似故曰症有屋傳服傳食傳之異死後又傳易傍人乃至滅門是也</p>
<p>得効云瘵蟲（即結核菌）之形或似蜣螂或似紅絲馬尾或似蝦蟆或似刺蝟或似鼠形或似爛麵或有足無頭或有頭無足種種形狀實難辨之若傳至三人則如人形如鬼狀</p>
<p>直指云瘵疾（即肺癆）之原因多有少年時血氣未定酒色傷損其熱毒鬱積生異物惡蟲蝕人臟腑其侍奉之人薰陶日久受其惡氣鑫遭傳染</p>
<p>按德國前帝國衛生院長考克博士發表云肺結核菌之形狀恰似桿棒狀不能自動其體甚微或直或灣其繁殖之法係本諸自身之分裂作用由一化二二化爲四四再裂爲八逐次倍加故繁殖率極爲可驚倘能任其繁殖於一適宜之處則一晝夜中一菌將變爲數百萬之巨蓋患癆病者之一塊痰中含有三萬萬個以上之結核菌苟蹡得毎小時咯痰一次則一晝夜中當有七十二萬萬之結核菌自該患者之肺内排出而散播於空氣中世人蒙其侵襲據德國大醫柏格爾博士發明云肺結核菌體係中性脂肪之内膜及抗酸性蠟質之外膜搆成若非設法破壞其蠟質之防線及解除其脂肪之武裝則無由俘擒結核菌而置之死地且結核菌侵入人體局部時其四週即被侵蝕而形成頑强之結節以阻碍血流之通過致使注射或内服之一般消毒藥劑無由越雷池一步宛如特别戒嚴之禁區藥力無從接觸患部則雖涨沈全身於藥池中亦不能殺結核菌之毫髮是故撲滅肺結核菌之唯一作戰方略至少必須具備下列之兩種先决條件</p>
<p>（1）凡藥能破壞結節而直逹患部者</p>
<p>（2）又能剥奪或溶解其蠟缸及脂肪性之内外膜者</p>
<h3>（二）中醫癆病藥古傳秘方之公開</h3>
<p>丹心云「身瘦屬火因火燒藥也肉脫盡者難治」直指云「瘵疾至於骨痛骨萎聲沈聲啞色枯面黧斷不可治」入門云「癆瘵咽嗆失音者死虚勞泄不止者亦」</p>
<p>正傳云「治瘵之法一則殺其蟲以絶其根本一則捕其虚以復其眞元若病勢已劇元氣已脫雖依法蟲亦無一生只可絶後人之傳注耳」</p>
<p>兹將中醫古來治癆秘方數則公開如下</p>
<p>（一）瓊玉膏塡精補髓調裏養性補百損除百病萬神俱足五臟盈溢日進數服功効不可盡述一料分十劑可救癆瘵一人（見入門）</p>
<p>（二）天靈蓋散有一婦人兩男子俱患癆瘵服此藥皆愈其功能下瘵蟲（見類聚）（三）紫金錠子治傳尸癆瘵一家兄弟五人並患傳尸癆已死者三人有方士敎令服此藥遂各服一錠皆愈（見醫鑒）</p>
<p>（四）獺肝治癆瘵取獺肝一具隂乾爲末温水調一錢日三服神効（見本事）（五）貓肝殺瘵蟲黑貓生取肝哂乾爲末月首五更空心温酒調服（見直指）</p>
<p>（六）鰻鱺魚殺傳尸癆蟲昔有一女子病瘵家人取置棺中流之於江漁人取之猶活多煮此魚食之病愈遂爲漁人之妻（見本草）</p>
<p>（七）童子尿治癆漈取飲之極効（見入門）</p>
<p>（八）白芨治吐血咯血冷水調末三錢服神妙（見綱目）白芨至血竅則塡補故血止昔有死囚拷掠遍身吐衂並流血常服白芨末輒止後凌遲開胸見白芨末皆塡補肺竅云（見醫說）</p>
<p>（九）蟲白蠟生肌止血定痛補虚入丸散服殺瘵蟲（見本草）</p>
<p>（十）紫河車丸治傳尸癆瘵服兩月皆可愈云（見入門）</p>
<p>中醫解剖學上肺臟之位置（御醫陽平君許浚氏撰）</p>
<h3>（三）西醫肺結核化學療法之發明</h3>
<p>蓋肺結核（即肺癆）之原因是結核菌而此菌一入人體内則於該處便成結節以斷血行之路又結核菌能分泌一種抗酸性蠟質包圍其體以防禦一切外藥力之侵入故雖用種種殺菌藥内服或注射終不能逹其病菌之實體内歷來醫家所慣用之自然療法對症療法理學的療法血清療法藥劑療法及其他一切治療法等尙未完全成功而肺病無藥之說遍滿於一世者因未知此深奥學理故耳由此現代結核學者根據上述之學理繼續研究不遺餘力結果竟成此殺盡肺癆菌之化學聖劑名曰三那星SANOSIN此藥係遵肺癆菌發明者德國考克博士與肺癆菌脫蠟術發明家德國栢格爾博士之最新醫理而發明成功者據現下德國瑞士及其他各國諸肺病療養院之實驗報告此藥有糝透肺病竃之結節及溶解蠟質之作用兼具有殺菌力能根治一二三期之肺癆確有萬試萬靈之特效在中國業經國民政府中央衛生試驗所化騐藥性和平無毒絶無任何副作用</p>
<p>兹略舉醫治作用於下</p>
<p>（一）設於試驗管中實驗「三那星」之藥力作用則一分鐘後結核菌皆消失其抗酸性至三分鐘後則此肺結核菌完全殺盡無一倖免</p>
<p>（二）依動物試騐則發見「三那星」能滲人結核病竃内設檢查其病竃内濳伏之結核菌則盡失其抗酸性此足證明其蠟質之完溶解矣</p>
<p>（三）如患者内服「三那星」一星期左右則立見咯痰稀釋體熱下降等良好狀態</p>
<p>（四）更繼續内服「三那星」逹三十天至六十天以上則顯見體重增加食懲激進一切症狀逐漸緩和終逹其回天再造之偉功</p>
<p>奉送三那星實騐報告書及肺病療養指導書函索即寄</p>
<p>上海仁記路三十五號（卽四川路仁記路口）美商愛世開洋行宣傳部啟</p>
<p>忽得附近鄰人報告謂該牛已被北曹家宅北橋堍宰牛作内所竊去等語該坊立即派人按址前往直衝而入果見該牛業已捆縛上正擬動刀宰殺陳遂上前將牛解下並將該作夥（即宰手）袁阿弟（年二十六）一併扭住嗚察拘四六區警署經任區長分别審訊一過以案關偷竊耕牛竟敢私行宰殺以冀滅跡售賣實屬可惡旋即備文併解地方法院訊究並聞該鎭各商家素以該作日宰耕頭穢氣四溢有礙衛生實匪淺鮮今又竟敢白晝竊牛私行宰殺現决公呈衛生局請求嚴加取締</p>

<h3>廿八年來别克汽車進展史</h3>
<p>— 沛甘</p>
<p>别克汽車現年二十八歲矣在此二十八年之前有佛林得貨車製造創辦者四人聞得大衛别克在底特律地方製造一種汽車引擎此四人爲謀佛林得廠之前途發展計即前往考察此種新引擎之究經焉别克所發明者爲一種汽門在頭之摩托能用之於大道之上作爲運輸之具者也佛林得廠之四人均爲該廠之高級職員對於汽車事業極饒興味聯袂往底特律考察别克所製造之模型此四人者巴倫求·喜丁·貝格爾·及克明士·是也旣駕此車即詳細觀察其行動及構造待返佛林得後此汽門在頭之摩托車即因其價值而出售一九零三年此四人組織别克摩托公司具有力焉並於米西根之佛林得地方建築一樓高之敞屋第一輛之别克車身爲佛林得貨車製造廠所製其地點即在别克之同一街上</p>
<p>第一輛别克汽車之尾路試騐述之頗有興趣造車者由底特律駛至佛林得費時三小時又三十七分鐘全程泥污滿道深可寸許駕車者之頭面亦爲之濺及但此小小引擎則經由旁台克奥克司福特及拉比亞等處安抵佛林得第一輛之别克車其完竣之實在時日爲一九零四年七月一日造車之時間幾及兩個月其時佛林得之海爾史博士爲此車之購買者對於機械之進步大爲注意</p>
<p>據海爾史博士言第一輛之别克汽車特殊之點甚多能自車旁啓門登車不似舊式之從車後登車者具有壓力滑油系之裝製汽油由空氣之壓力而送入添油機但壓力之不均無可諱言及至今日大爲進步矣至於壓力之變異者緣於拐臂箱之不能緊閉毫不滿氣故也然此第一輛之别克汽車亦殊耐久海爾史博士駕用此車有四年之久然後轉售於喬治惠勃其時方任别克公司之製造股主任也某星期日之下午海爾史博士邀請杜蘭脫夫婦及其女公子駕車取樂杜氏坐於前車座對此能駛之怪物大爲注意是年杜蘭脫購得别克公司之管理權未幾將工廠遷至甲克遜房屋較爲寛大其後則又計劃將别克廠遷返佛林得</p>
<p>别克汽車之進步發展無時或已自第一輛汽車創製後曾未幾時即有跑車隊之組織冠其首者爲野博勃盤門及魯意司雪佛萊等凡遇汽車競賽常獲冠軍之榮譽車機摩托之改良進步毎年必有一次自四只汽缸之引擎發明因機力大增兩汽缸者即擯棄不用四開之車門未幾採爲標準之用駕駛及管理之機括亦自車右遷至車左</p>
<p>其時佛林得街道中之别克試騐爲尋常慣見之事製造廠中自闢一試騐之道路以决定汽車之速率爲如何然爲試騐各種之道路情形起見毎一新車出必駕之駛往佛林得城中各處及鄉道之間以爲測騐一九一零年時爲汽車事業蕭條之季别克車爲發展前途計毅然以革新之精神創六汽缸車自採用新引擎後駕駛得其便捷行動覺其平穏乘坐感其舒適即其車身之式樣亦大加改良日趨美觀一九一二年終别克造車逹九四○○○輛蓋毎年均有增加焉</p>
<p>别克車日增月盛直至一九一九年而止因美國參與世界大戰别克於此時不得不减少其汽車之出産俾得製造軍用之具又因壯夫多在戎馬機器製造之事由婦人代理别克廠於此時乃有自由摩托之出産其製造之方式則與别克摩托同其效率别克效力戰事之中尙爲英政府製造軍用拖車多輛其引擎爲汽門在頭式另裝特製之駕駛軸自定單領到後二星期别克即將樣車呈核准即照樣製造計共造一百四十二輛軍用汽車至休戰日止定貨亦止</p>
<p>此時期中别克之管理方面亦起一重大變更總理克雷斯勒繼納許總理之後亦宣告辭職繼任者爲臘明登軍用品機械專家柏賽脫氏爲實業界中之有數人財自經柏氏執政廠中進步日益起色因柏氏係機械家洞悉汽車製造之眞諦與手下各部份互相聯絡才力大顯效率日增</p>
<p>一千九百二十六年冬十月柏賽脫在巴黎染病未幾去世通用汽車公司即擇任職十年之司德朗君繼任司氏自下而上擢升要職亦難得之人材也去年中别克廠擴大組織出品較前尤精至於一九二九年之銀週紀念及一九三零年之新車式樣司氏之力更足多焉</p>

<h3>「穏妥第一」</h3>
<p>— 人</p>
<p>爲駕師这前題　爲行人之警告</p>
<p>或有人謂「穏妥第一」乃一種無稽之談徒然有所憂慮妨碍進行應廢除之又謂在無奈或必需之時冒險亦屬必需或能得到美滿結果亦未可知如此見解當今複雜車務情形之下實屬荒唐極矣</p>
<p>駕駛汽車有關人命應十分謹愼所謂「穏妥第一」是也若開車無所顧忌即爲犯法之本應嚴加取締近來各汽車製造廠家如美國通用汽車公司等對於種種安全設計與機械改良如車制車擋車燈及其他各種安全設備以及當局對於車務管理之認眞平日尙有許多慘禍事情發生未堪設想何况自由駕駛不顧大局乎</p>
<p>車禍大都因駕駛與行人雙方蘇忽而造成之在駕駛方面速度過敏開車大意經騐不足眼光滯鈍均爲肇禍之主因今各國大城之街道均大加放闊改良加以車廠之出品亦十分精確優美不應再發生何種危險是以車禍之成往往因駕師大意與速度過快或以開車爲兒嬉有以致之也</p>
<p>雖然行人亦宜負一部之責任蓋禍端之起由於雙方忽略行人往往徘徊途中逍遥自在不顧車輛行動穿越街心以致衝傷軋斃枉爲輪下之鬼實咎由自取</p>
<p>欲免慘禍之發生必須駕師與行人雙方合作駕駛人尤宜特别注意對於引擎機件應常加檢察速度快慢須有節制轉灣應極小心喇叭宜用得時則車禍是减矣</p>

<h3>美國讀書界現狀</h3>
<p>— 雋山</p>
<p>古典文學銷路暢旺</p>
<p>近年來美國的讀書界大爲旺盛書籍的銷路是歷年來未有的鉅大但出　界却大受困難雖是銷書極多但因出版的書籍太多了所以營業方面也不見得有什麽大的利益可獲因此有的出版者將書價大减特減以冀人們貪廉買它有的出版者却將出版品大减竟减去百分之二十五他們以爲出版的書少了讀書界自然都會買出的幾本了</p>
<p>那是一件不可否認的事實在近幾年來出版的書眞同雨後春筍一般但不幸之至這一大批之中大部分都是同價值的次等的小說和敷衍的傳略充斥市面且永不停止令旁觀的人看來好像美國的讀書界有些反常了但從另一方面看來又有些光明的現象杜登公司（E.　P.　Dutton　and　Co.）的麥克萊（Elliot　B,　Macrae）宣稱世界文學中的古典名著總是不斷的有暢旺的暢路萬人叢書（Evervman's　Library）很著名的一部名著叢刋也是杜登公司出版的自發行以來計暢去二千五百萬册一個很驚人的數目而此中暢路最好的不是收集在内的現代名著反是老古董的古典名著</p>
<p>麥克萊先生這樣說「我們出版界對新書出版總得用去百分之九十九的廣告宣傳推銷等手段但雖是這樣我們所得的結果却恰是相反我們祇用百分之一的力的莎士比亞和其他古人的著作反較現代新著作的銷路要好到百分之九十但這事實裏還有驚人的一端就是古典名著在美國有二十多家出版者印行所以我們所幹的營叢祗是全國的一上部分但現代的新著作其中全國統計銷路最旺的幾本都是我們獨家經理的」從他這一段談話中我們也可稍看到美國讀書界現在的趨勢狀况了</p>
<h3>棚下</h3>
<p>— 南蓀攝</p>
<p>紐約一家大書舖新近統計過一下萬人叢書裏銷路最暢的是以下幾本</p>
<p>莎士比亞的「悲劇」Sheakespeare's　Tragedies</p>
<p>狄根司的「大衛考貝非爾」或稱「塊肉餘生述」</p>
<p>莎士比亞的「喜劇」Sheakespeare's　Comedies</p>
<p>西萬提斯的「唐吉柯德」或稱「魔俠博」Don　Quixoto</p>
<p>杜斯推益夫斯基的「白痴」The　Idiot</p>
<p>柏拉圖的「共和國」Requblio</p>
<p>從這張表裏我們也可略窺美國讀書界的脾氣了他們所以爲愛讀的書似乎都和現代人的腦子不相諧和的但因他們選了這幾本書便不免使新著作倒霉了原來美國人的買書都有一定平常人都是一年買五本也有買了不看的一旦五本之中給古典名著佔了幾本自然不免把新書擠出了但這是全國美利堅的特徵他國是不能一概而論的如中國而論一年買五本書的人已寥寥可數了</p>
<p>時髦的來了又去了没有長久祇有已過去的大文豪的有價值的名著　會衰落的這事實對著作者是何等大的一個鼓勵啊</p>
<h3>國際電信之指南</h3>
<p>二十世紀社會被人公認爲電器時代一切的文明都擺不脫電氣的勢力而尤其是在相隔幾萬里的人也能藉着電信的傳逹來發展他們一切的設施所以電信是國際間交通的利器不過關於專門講述國際電信事業的專書却還没有現在北歐的小國丹麥印行了一部「國際電信指</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>南在内中講述到五萬或六萬已簽字習用國際電線的國家内的電局而對於電信事務無線電信及美國與南美洲的電信交通特别講到過對於中國方面没有講到是因爲他們覺得中國還没有如何感覺到國際電信不流通的困難而這開世界的先河的「國際電信指南」特别對於商務發逹的國家如英法美德頭是有特别的實用（易康）</p>

<h3>北遊印象（三）</h3>
<p>— 蘇靈</p>
<p>經過大連</p>
<p>海行了兩日半在大連登岸了</p>
<p>在旅館裏打了電話給老楊很快地他就來了他完全不像在上海時的樣子比在上海要活潑快樂而且紳士得多了這該是生活比較安定的原故</p>
<p>「哦蘇靈你來了船上没有爲難嗎」他驚異而怱忙地緊握着我的手</p>
<p>「啊没有什麽不過日本水上警察檢查了一下我的箱子單檢查我一個　老陳却没有被檢查呢」</p>
<p>「是呀你這個樣子我非常担心你打電話給我呌我快些來我以爲有了什麽爲難的事呢不過還好你怎樣對他說的呢」</p>
<p>『哦那個日本人他不會中國話又不會英語我說了很久當他查到我一卷一卷的稿子和一捆一捆的信件的時候没有法子我寫給他看了我寫着一這是情書」「一這是愛情小說」他笑了走去玩撲克牌可却累了我很久的整理』</p>
<p>第二天到老楊的家裏去看他的畫因爲他一個星期後要開展覽會他要我給他寫篇批評的東西</p>
<p>我很驚異他的努力在他那畫室裏所放着的差不多件作品是他已擇選過了的雖然那裏很少有成熟的表現他的畫差不多就是他生活的表白所以他的作品都是抒情的我在他的作品中看出了三個時期三種作風的轉變那正代表他生活的三個階段</p>
<h3>起賽之前</h3>
<p>— 華攝</p>
<p>第一期正是他組織天心盡會的努力的時期所以那一時期的作品是充分地有熱烈希望的表現從塔街花與曼陀鈴等幅的用色與用筆上可以看得出産出他第二期的作品的作風時正是他失戀於一位少女與歸家之前的時候所以在這一階段裏的作品是充滿着傷感悲哀與詩的情調如「飛雪之夜」「橋頭」「落葉」等幅是這樣的表現着等到他歸家之後生活旣安平思想又不蕪雜自然能夠有努力沈着新鮮的作品産出了如「白壁」「燈下」等幅實在這幾幅確是不可多得的幾幅</p>
<p>我在旅館裏立刻給老楊的畫寫了一篇東西可是自已却感覺到十二分的慚愧老楊的努力獲得到的是眞實我的流浪只把時間浪費了而所獲得的只是空虚</p>
<h3>住居亭子樓的人</h3>
<p>— 陸向閒</p>
<p>白君剛才一到這小上的亭子樓便熱鬧得不通氣因爲他是喜歡哼京調的人仔要是到了我們這地便從壁上取下了胡琴自已吚呀吚呀的調着絃音隨後便是一聲「太保傳令」或「提起了當年涙」跟着和唱</p>
<p>今天又增加了楷君在場他是一個拉琴的老手這來白更高興站了起來提高嗓子大哼特哼窗下左邊坐着的庥君拿着竹筷在桌沿邊敲着拍節的快慢板眼我想這彷彿有點像大世界游戲塲的光景把整個的秋夜鬧得翻天覆地四壁唧唧寒蛩寒哀鳴也被這一時的景相吞没再也不能聽見引人的秋興</p>
<p>這也許大自然的定律吧「盛極必衰」楷無故厭倦的放下胡琴隨着庥的竹筷也停止了敲板白是早以把頭伸在窗外探望唱聲停止大家於是便靜靜的看着室裏的電燈各人默想着各人的心思探尋着什麽忽地白嘔了一口氣把頭縮了進來望着我們庥君是照例開玩笑的講話說「白　嘔什麽氣呵我看你你件事還是作罷論的好天下的女人多得很呢何必緊戀着她一人」於是更引起了白的傷感看他的面上雖帶着笑顔其實這種慘笑無論如何是遮不着他内心的悲慘</p>
<p>楷接着憤恕的說『媽的女人眞是「禍水」』揑着拳頭向床沿上重力的一擊白被這一聲的響打動了他的心思聲音雖大却帶着顫動的隂慘緩緩的發表他的悲慘遭遇</p>
<p>目光含憤的觀着楷的面孔驚異的問道「楷怎麽你也同我一樣的遇着不幸現在害得我日夜不安連做事行路也在恍惚中過日子她忍心殘酷的摒棄了我但我却不能忍心離開她現在的朋友雖說是百般勸我撒手但是我怎麽能永久離開她呢猶其是近來這幾夜我在床上愈想愈急想起她重前對我好的時候光景現在我郤變了與别個男子通信也寫着從前向我寫過的親親愛愛的話你想我心裏是多麽的難過喲在家鄉地方同我决裂是很不要緊的現在郤到了上海才變心唉」白又嘔了一口氣面部的表情由緊張而弛緩庥又乘機向他開玩笑說「這明明又是你在其中吃醋與别的男子寫信有什麽關係我看她對你却還好」</p>
<p>楷這時也跟着勸他寛心「我想你們的事是好調解的現在她旣是到了上海來唉祗铱我自已的事才不好辦我已自時常想與别人當軍師主謀解决别人的事這次郤輪到自已的頭上來自已没有辦法了這也祗怪我家裏人爲什麽還不錢兌來弄得我今天等明天一天一天的到等過去現在等出了岔子若他們把錢早點兌來我同她早已回去過快樂日子了媽的愈想愈不過味用了他這許多錢」楷說着又將拳頭在床沿上擊這吓彷彿是打着了他心恨的東西</p>
<p>「錢」在白的腦裏顯然湧起波濤我自已的這事失敗不是爲的牠錢嗎</p>
<p>庥這時很沈靜的說「我看錢和女人確有重大而嚴密的關係要是一個男子没有錢終久是不能同女人長住在一塊兒白的事我看不成功的緣故大半是與錢有關係楷的事情那是很明顯的是爲錢有了錢蜜絲蘇早已同你一道返鄉去了爲什麽你家裏現在還没有把錢兌到」</p>
<p>自這時心裏似乎現了新路坦然的向着大家講『老實說一句我現在若有錢難道她不愛我嗎庥說的不錯前夜我到魯君處去玩恰又巧遇着她同幾個女同學一道來了那時我進退兩離祗得忍耐坐下我聽了他們大家爭論男女戀愛問題心裏像如燒樣難過當時魯向她們說了這句話「現在要同女子講愛非有錢是不成功的這是眼前一般事實的證叨」因爲魯也是情塲失意的人得來的敎訓她却故意譏諷樣暗示我對魯滑稽</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>的回答「是嗎我們女子當然是爲錢才專愛男子喲」你們想我當時聽了心裏是如何的難過想馬上走出去又想太難爲情了她們總之我在那裏她說這樣話無疑的用意來譏諷我現在我要到南洋羣島去聽說那地很容易發財敎書做實業經商都是很好發財和媽的找錢來同她講戀愛有了錢她豈有不愛我的你想到南洋去對不對』</p>
<p>楷低着頭在想他的事祗有庥笑面呆聽着他的言論好像是慶祝他到南洋去發大財成功了他的戀愛「從前我向她在信上說過許多好話叙述我身世的困苦祇有你一人才是我生活的救星我滿離開了你我的生命使遭滅亡庥女人的心别人說很慈善在我看來却比毒蛇還毒我把一切的好話問他說盡了她還是不諒解我她的心腸比鐵石還硬我現在有什麽法了來自慰我時刻都回憶着我同她過去的情影有時我口裏雖是那樣恨她其實在我心裏很難過駡她咒詛她是一種無辦法愛他的動」</p>
<p>楷這時抬起頭來望了一望白順手在桌上翻着零亂報章口休息着不講了「媽的算了算了再等幾天不來我一人收拾返家女人眞是禍水」楷又在發表滿心的憂憤</p>
<p>白感覺得時間不早向他們招呼了一聲便走緩步下了樓梯走出房門秋風悄悄的吹來寒意他感覺到穿的夜服單薄不和時重新的哼着京調「提起了當年涙」</p>
<p>庥聽見忙把頭伸出窗外去望看着他那廋小的黑影在衖口的轉角處消逝寂寥襲來包圍了四鄰楷重把頭低下又在仔細思索他對於蜜絲蘇的辦法</p>

<h3>時代</h3>
<p>— 菽花</p>
<p>中國美術刋行社出版</p>
<p>祇要大家知道我們現在所處的時代對於我們是有一個何等重大而且急切底要求今後的國與民族或許會在今日底民族主義運動上頭先打好了一個鞏固的基礎不則白色底和赤色底火燄不祇是令我們恐怖·震驚·在不久的將來還很能夠把我們民族與國家變成了炭灰和焦土時代對於我們是這麽地高聲驚告急切地對於我們有這麽地一個重大底要求要求我們立覺醒起來在撫着過去底創痕憬悟於我們今後的掙扎圖存與一切事件底成功是全仗於羣性底集中與羣力底圑結如果再這麽地萬民如睡依然地散沙似的一堆那末回首固已凄然設想更其不堪了所以在今日的我們在給時代警告要求而覺醒了的我們在我們毎個人的肩頭都已負着一個提倡與運動民族主義的重大責任</p>
<p>是的提倡與運動民族主義是我們當前的急務也就是現時代所授給與我們的軍符敎我們站在戰綫上打前鋒對於白色底赤色底加以强烈的正攻與逆襲我們已經開始作戰了我們在戰期内還希望我們的同情者一致的加入我們的戰綫裏頭聯合起來爲我們自已的民族和國家而奮鬥因此我們在今日出版物上便有所要求我們在今日的出版物上便要找尋同情者了大抵在文藝上有了相當修養的人是没有不愛自已的民族國家與社會的是以在我們揭繫而後四方響應的很多如今我在圖畫刋物的上頭又發現民族主義的戰士</p>
<p>其實圖畫刋物的根本意義也和其他文藝刋物一樣是在民族意識的立塲上所形成的不過文藝刋物述之以文字而圖畫刋物表之以圖畫而已但是文藝的没落已經使人感到痛心而因這麽的一個關聯圖畫刋物也隨之而没落到最低度了並且編者又極其淺薄與無聊益發使它畸形得可怕在它裏面不祇是找不到民族意識抑且垃圾成堆左一塊右一塊横的竪的方的圓的盡都是些香烟盒橘子皮和那些腐而腥臭的東西敎人見了欲嘔</p>
<p>一本圖畫刋物的出版也和文藝刋物一樣是不容易的第一編者要有文藝修養民族意識世界眼光政治及其它一切的常識然後才能夠胸有定見取材洽當而其所負任務是在民族意識的立塲上所形成的宣揚文化介紹新知促進文明提倡美術和改善生活這種種俱由於編者在圖畫的取材上表焉出之使讀者在披閱之下得到了無限底裨益而這本圖畫刋物便就是時代所需求</p>
<p>上海我們當然承認是出版物薈萃底中心一切圖畫出版物的刋行也和文藝刋物一樣底風起雲湧我們在書店裏在報攤上所見到的以美貎女子照片而加以　爛色彩爲封面的畫都是這一類的東西然而合乎時代而爲時代所需要的據我個人的判斷說來就祇有「良友」與「時代」「良友」已有它自已相當的歷史在告訴給人們不必勞我在這裏詞費「時代」誕生還不到一年但它頭角崢嶸已一般地給人們肯定它是圖畫刋物中的後起之秀了</p>
<p>它是中國美術刋行社所出版而由在文藝上有了相當修養的漫家葉淺予鄭光漢等幾位先生所合編的故取材與編排兩方面很顯著地給我們見到它的意識中心與輕飄韻緻在它的意識中心裏他們編者有幾句話說得很對</p>
<p>「適應人類生活趨向實用時候纔有所謂時代所以無論什麽人都有負起爲時代服務的責任我們根據了這個意義自已執了一支筆和一柄剪刀悉悉索索地寫拉拉撕撕剪心裏總存着種種的喜歡並不是我們敢誇耀些什麽因爲我們總覺得爲時代上服務而生出許多希望來</p>
<p>民族性的低落我們認爲痛心的事所以我們不怕自已露自已的缺點凡是世界上認爲優美的我們借他來參考决不會我們所做不到的從前希臘婦人懷着孕到愛神廟裏天天去祈禱希望生下一個美麗的孩子像愛神一般這就是崇拜理想産生事實的明證所以在西洋民族性裏天天有祈禱纔生了許多美麗的孩子我們不思人家責難採取優美的東西不過是崇揚一件東西不是長他人的志氣滅自已的威風</p>
<p>美麗有人說是形象有人竟說他奢華但是我們認爲内中有强健性的原質世界上因爲有美麗纔生出了許多趣味這個趣味足以維護人類的生命」（第二期）</p>
<p>在上抄的幾段編者的說話我們知道這幾位先生在編這本「時代」的意識中心是爲時代服務是因民族性的低落是因要崇拜理想産生事實是因美麗會生出許多趣味是以維護人類的生命所以我們在打開了一本「時代」來看時總見到他們對於他們所抱的主張有充份地表現於是我們益明顯地見到他們是在民族意識的立塲上所形成的宣揚文化介紹新知促進文明提倡美術和改善生活</p>

<p>Telegram from Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<h3>### Sincere Advice to Enemy Soldiers</h3>
<p>"If you resolutely defect before the Day of Respect, the Central Government will still treat you equally."</p>
<p>Nanjing: General Commander Chiang Kai-shek sent a telegram from his camp to all soldiers of the former Second and Third Army Corps. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>To all soldiers of the former Second and Third Army Corps: Chiang Kai-shek and you have shared hardships and are like brothers. Since the start of the military campaign, I have repeatedly given sincere advice and my concern has never wavered. Last month, on the Day of Nourishment (Yangri), I sent a telegram to the National Government, going to great lengths to plan for your benefit. Unfortunately, you are still being held hostage by Feng Yuxiang and unable to extricate yourselves. Another month has passed. Today's situation is different from before. From Lanfeng, Qi County, Tongxu, Weishi, Yuchuan, Changge, and Xinzheng in the east, to Xingyang and Fanshui in the west, our army's grand encirclement plan has been fully completed. Feng Yuxiang should be well aware of this. How will he plan for himself? The struggle of a trapped beast is no longer permissible. The doomsday of Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang is approaching. Are all of his subordinates blindly following, willing to be buried as personal sacrifices? There must be many generals and soldiers who understand reason, embrace righteousness, abandon the rebels, and follow the righteous path. With divided wills, how can you fight? If you want to retreat north of the Yellow River, breaking through the encirclement will not be easy. Moreover, the Northeast Army is sending troops to Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin), and the base of the pseudo-government has been broken. Deputy Commander Zhang has sent a telegram to maintain unity and listen to the Central Government's handling of state affairs. The defense forces in Xinxiang and Zhangde have long received orders from the Central Government and made preparations. They will not allow you to cross the border. If you want to flee west from Yuxian and other places to Luoyang, our army has also made strict interception preparations. After a disastrous flight, you will only face complete defeat from renewed attacks. Today, you have nowhere to retreat and nowhere to escape. In fact, there is no need to retreat or escape. Chiang Kai-shek cares for you as before. Although we have taken an encirclement posture, we have no intention of annihilation. I will fulfill the promises made in the telegram on the Day of Nourishment. You have fought hard until today, originally belonging to the army under the Central Government. Now, if you continue to obey the Central Government and support unity, it will be of benefit to your reputation. The sooner the war ends, the sooner the country's danger and the people's suffering will be relieved. Chiang Kai-shek sincerely offers this advice again, hoping that you will uphold your long-held aspirations to save the country and love the people, resolutely defect before the Day of Respect, take up your original defenses, and await the Central Government's handling. The Central Government will still treat you equally and regard you as a trusted confidant. If you continue to waver and willingly make unnecessary sacrifices, then you will be the architects of your own misfortune, and Chiang Kai-shek will be unable to help you. Fortune or misfortune is your own choice, merit or crime is in this moment. This is my final statement, I hope you will consider it carefully. Chiang Kai-shek, September 20, 1920.</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Future of the German Political Situation</h3>
<p>Germany is also a multi-party political system. The reason why it has been able to maintain a spirit of cooperation and gradually solidify its party base since the establishment of the republic ten years ago is due to the appropriate use of liaison methods by the ruling party. The reason why the ruling party has used liaison appropriately is that the power of the two extreme parties on the left and right has not yet become significant, and it is easier for other parties to unite with the ruling party. Therefore, although there has been some animosity between political parties in recent years, there has not been a state of outright conflict and intolerance between this party and that party. Even when the political situation is turbulent, there are no signs of violent chaos or unrest. This is why the German government often relies on its strength to maintain itself amidst the competition of various factions. Since this election, the situation is about to change drastically again. The current ruling Central Party is the one that overthrew the Social Democratic Party, the previous ruling party, and replaced it. In terms of the situation, it is naturally not easy for the Central Party and the Social Democratic Party to cooperate. Even if they realize that cooperation is necessary in the current situation and reluctantly join hands, they may not be able to occupy a majority. Therefore, it is necessary to win over an extreme faction. However, if they win over the left wing, the right wing will definitely unite with other parties to resist. If they win over the right wing, the left wing will unite with other parties to show hostility. Moreover, the position of Germany today is very important. Its diplomatic relations are even more numerous. Uniting with either the left or the right will have a significant impact internationally. Therefore, the German government cannot only consider the convenience of internal unity and blindly unite with any faction. It must carefully consider the situation of European diplomacy, weigh the interests of the world situation, and then decide on a policy to work with. This is also the primary task of the German government today. If it does not do so and blindly unites with it, the impact it produces will be more than just domestic instability.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, it has been very difficult for small countries to be between two major powers, serving both Qi and Chu. However, if its government is good at diplomacy, it can also temporarily survive in peace. If the German political party today is between two incompatible major parties, then there are things that cannot be achieved by means of double-dealing. The difficulty of the position it is in is truly rare in the world today.</p>

The Netherlands is willing to cooperate with a method under which low-tax countries are not allowed to raise their tax rates, and high-tax countries must also lower their tax rates. The Netherlands cannot approve of the Romanian representative's claim that agricultural countries should receive preferential treatment from importing countries because free-trade Netherlands would have to levy taxes in order to give such preferential treatment, which would raise the price of food for the Dutch people. The French representative said that if there is a uniform method to ensure safety in tax rate matters, France is prepared to join the negotiations to place the tax rate system on the old basis of equal opportunities for everyone in the domestic market. The German representative argued that all European countries should form a complete customs union as a solution to agricultural and other economic problems. He believed that many European countries are prepared to guarantee Britain that mutual tax groupings are beneficial to Britain.</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 22nd) At the time of the League of Nations debate on the dumping of foreign goods in Geneva, British grain exchange officials happened to be talking about the plummeting grain prices. The situation of farmers in Britain and its territories has never been more critical than it is today. Prices on the grain exchanges in Liverpool, England, and the Baltic countries have reached absurdly low levels. The reason is that the grain grown and harvested by forced labor in Soviet Russia is now being shipped from Black Sea ports and dumped in the markets of various countries. The United States is also in this same situation. The US Secretary of Agriculture stated that Soviet Russia is currently dumping grain in the Chicago market, which is very detrimental to American farmers. It is impossible for Russia to deliver goods in Chicago with a tax rate of 42 cents per bushel. A Cardiff visitor reported the matter of Russian wheat flooding the market, saying that Soviet Russia has chartered ships on an unprecedented scale in recent weeks, at least 170 ships totaling over 500,000 tons, to carry wheat and timber from the Black Sea and North Russian ports.</p>
<p>(Pacific News Agency, Washington, 22nd) The matter of Soviet Russian officials in Chicago selling wheat at reduced prices, causing losses to American farmers, has recently been discovered in New York, where Soviet Russia has sold short approximately 100,000 tons of goods. The Department of Agriculture is now seeking preventive measures. The Director of the Chicago Board of Trade accepted the preventive order and stated that he is willing to do his best, but also said that this matter should be studied and assessed for protection or retaliation. His intention seems to be that the actions manipulated by Soviet Russia should be banned, but in this time of economic change, it may not be helpful to buy American goods even if the wheat price is low.</p>

<p>Publicity Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters of the Chinese Nationalist Party</p>
<p>(National News Agency, Geneva, 22nd) Today, German Foreign Minister Curtius and Polish Foreign Minister Zaleski argued fiercely during a discussion of minority issues. Curtius actually rebuked Zaleski, saying that Germany had no need to interfere in the debate on this case, while Curtius said that the League of Nations Secretariat's minority issue report this year was completely inappropriate. Finally, French Foreign Minister Briand stepped in to mediate and proposed that all countries should give minorities the opportunity to participate in the government and make them jointly responsible for the country. A dispute ended.</p>
<p>(Pacific News Agency, Geneva, 22nd) The Political Committee continued to discuss the minority issue. The Greek representative praised the representatives who supported the current method. The German representative said that the current method is derived from the Madrid Agreement, which is actually an assimilation policy. The Greek representative declared that it was quite strange to agree, and replied to the Polish representative that the German representative's intention was to re-arouse the interest of the public opinion circles and the League of Nations in the minority issue, and that the goal had been achieved. As for the Madrid Agreement, it originally only involved a few countries, and it would be okay to promote it to other countries in Europe. The Hungarian representative approved of this proposal and requested that the country enjoy equal rights internationally. The French representative said that the League of Nations' work on minority issues has been criticized by various parties, which is not fair. The German delegation is dissatisfied with the League of Nations, and its proposal should not be reported. People's hearts should be calmed, and the agreements that have been signed cannot be discarded before implementation. The League of Nations is based on mutual treaties between countries, and all obligations within the scope of the treaties have been fully implemented. American Banker Leo N.</p>
<h3>Opinions on Saving the Silver Market</h3>
<p>(Reuters, New York, 22nd) Banker Leo N., who previously served as an advisor to the US Treasury Department, published his views on the silver market, saying that the treasury departments of Britain, the United States, France, and Mexico must change their current currency policies and accumulate more silver. This move will have a far-reaching impact on the psychology of the people in the East, and international trade will benefit from it. Mexico and Britain's reduction in the weight and fineness of silver coins, France's failure to restore hard currency, and the United States' failure to purchase much silver and release cash are all reasons for the sluggishness of the silver market. Leo N. advocated (1) that the Mexican government restore the weight and fineness of silver coins so that the Mexican government can obtain silver mining revenue as the price of silver increases; (2) that the British government take the same action to increase the price of silver and Far Eastern exchange rates and receive the benefits of commercial recovery and increased tax revenue; (3) that France recoin hard currency and release its unneeded cash to silver-producing countries to establish silver reserves for trade with its Near East and Far East territories; (4) that the United States accumulate more silver and release cash to countries in need of gold to alleviate the current situation of the American silver mining industry.</p>
<h3>The Failure of the Chilean Revolution</h3>
<p>Instigators Arrested</p>
<p>Reuters, Santiago, 22nd - South American Chilean newspapers report that the rebellion against the current government in Concepcion has been quelled, and the instigators have been arrested.</p>
<p>Reuters, Buenos Aires, 22nd - The unrest in Concepcion, Chile, was instigated by the rebel army of Groussac, who had fled abroad. Groussac, accompanied by General Bravo, arrived in Concepcion by plane from Argentina. Upon seeing them, the commander of the Concepcion defense force, Lira, immediately ordered their arrest. Groussac resisted arrest with gunfire but was eventually captured and is now being held in a military camp.</p>
<h3>The Conclusion of the Korean Student Unrest Case</h3>
<p>Cha Jae-jeong and Others Determined Guilty</p>
<p>Seoul News - Since the Gwangju student incident occurred last October, more than ten schools in Seoul began a strike in December, causing dozens of schools throughout the province to be shaken and creating an unprecedented wave in Korean education circles. The behind-the-scenes planner was the "Student Vanguard League." After the case arose, the Seoul police stations investigated 225 people, of whom 45, including Cha Jae-jeong, were considered the chief instigators. The case was handled by the Seoul District Court preliminary trial judge, Yokomoto, for violating the Public Security Preservation Law. The preliminary trial has now concluded, and 13 people, including Cha, have been found guilty of violating the Public Security Preservation Law, the Publishing Law, and related regulations. Eighteen others were acquitted, and the remaining 14, being students, will be subject to separate preliminary trials. (World)</p>
<h3>The German Cabinet Convenes a Meeting</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 22nd - Political figures are currently focusing their attention on tomorrow's cabinet meeting. Prime Minister Brüning met with President Hindenburg today for a long discussion. Tomorrow's cabinet meeting will be convened. Although the matters for discussion have not been officially announced, it is said that the first item will be to discuss the proposal for a new parliament, and the second will be to determine the scope of cooperation with the leaders of various parties. This is because the current government parties are in an absolute minority in parliament and cannot be maintained without cooperation with either the left or right wing. However, some elements behind the scenes refuse to join hands with the National Socialist Party, while others do not want to cooperate with the Social Democratic Party, so this matter is extremely thorny. The National Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. If, by the opening of parliament on October 13, they are still unable to unite with any party, they can only hope that the left or right wing will consider the welfare of the country and provide support on any single issue in order to maintain the government's position.</p>
<h3>Postponement of the Opening of the British Imperial Conference</h3>

The most important discussions at this meeting will all be about economic issues, such as changes in tax rates, preferential treatment for imperial tax rates, research into agriculture and industry, and imperial maritime, air, sea cable, and wireless transport and communications.</p>

<h3>Establishment of a Treaty of Friendship between Italy and Austria</h3>
<p>Has Been Submitted to the League of Nations for Record</p>
<p>Geneva News - The Treaty of Friendship and Arbitration between the governments of Italy and Austria has been formally signed, and the text of the treaty has been sent to the League of Nations for recording and publication. For hundreds of years, Italy has regarded Austria as its natural enemy, so this time, Italy's ability to dispel suspicion and conclude a mutual assistance agreement is widely regarded by all parties as a major international event. The content of the treaty generally stipulates that disputes between Italy and Austria, regardless of their nature, should be resolved through understanding and peaceful means; otherwise, they should be submitted to legal arbitration without the use of force. However, disputes that occurred before the signing of the treaty are reserved and not bound by the text of the treaty. According to the League of Nations records, Italy now has ten treaties with other countries, including Germany, Austria, Chile, Spain, Finland, the British Empire, Hungary, Lithuania, Switzerland, and Turkey.

<h3>Telegrams</h3>
<p>Xi'an Telegram to All Newspapers: Shaanxi has suffered consecutive years of severe drought, with seven years of crop failure. Recently, abundant rainfall has brought renewed growth to seedlings and crops, raising hopes for a harvest to get through the year. Unexpectedly, grasshoppers have swarmed and wreaked havoc. Witnesses in Wugong, Xingping, Xianyang, Liquan, Qianxian, Fufeng, and Mei counties report that autumn crops have been gnawed, leaving bare stalks or red earth. There is no hope for an autumn harvest, and not a single grain has been harvested. Other counties have reported disasters and requested relief one after another. The refugees who had just gathered are still being displaced, and the long-starved elderly and weak are facing death. If winter relief is not urgently arranged, starvation will follow starvation imminently. The tragic situation of last year will be repeated this winter. Thinking about the future, we cannot help but weep. We, Lan and others, are weak and our hearts ache, and our efforts have been exhausted in urgent relief. Disasters are widespread, and flooding is even more worrying. It is difficult to obtain resources from Guandong to provide assistance. We dare not refuse the responsibility of appealing. In addition to first telegraphing to allocate wheat seeds to Wugong and other seven counties and having Director Hu of our association's investigation team investigate the disaster situation in detail in various jurisdictions, we humbly hope that philanthropists at home and abroad will have compassion for the survivors and generously provide relief, whether it be distributing bran porridge or dispensing clothing. Gather funds from frugal living and give generously without ceasing. We will urgently bare our heads and tie our hair to save those in need. We respectfully invite you to visit the disaster areas in person to provide relief. To alleviate the suffering is to complete the highest level of the seven-story pagoda. We hope that the weak can eventually emerge from the disaster. We rely on your continued efforts to avoid wasting previous efforts. Overcome with emotion, we send this telegram and offer our highest wishes. Zhu Qinglan, Tang Zong, Guo Hao, and Seal of the North China Charity Federation.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Telegram to All Newspapers: Since the rebellion of Yan and Feng, there has been continuous warfare and no peaceful days. Their conspiracy to overthrow the party and the country and destroy unity has long been understood by the people. In order to suppress the rebellion, the central government had no choice but to use force. Thanks to the leadership of our commander-in-chief and the valiant efforts of the officers and soldiers, the rebel flags have been easily defeated. Yan and Feng have suffered heavy blows, and the pseudo-expanded conference in Beiping has collapsed. Those with common sense have long known that their demise is inevitable and that their destruction is imminent. Yet they still refuse to wake up and continue to struggle desperately. Wherever the war reaches, villages are left in ruins. Alas, our people are suffering and displaced, all caused by the rebellion of Yan and Feng. Now, Vice Commander Zhang of Shenyang has cleverly telegraphed to advocate peace and jointly plan for the country, stating that everything should await the central government's arrangements. His words are stern and his righteousness is just, which is admired by all. There is no other way to stabilize the country and quell the chaos. A talented person who is devoted to the party and the country and cares deeply cannot lag behind others. It is hoped that the whole country will unanimously advocate and ensure that Yan and Feng step down as soon as possible to apologize to the people, and stop fighting like trapped beasts to cause more suffering to our people. We further hope that wise men at home and abroad will express their great views and wait for the central government to adopt them to jointly seek a thorough solution to achieve lasting peace, so that the party and the country can be peacefully and unified. This is what we sincerely hope for. We respectfully announce our intentions and hope for your understanding. Zhang Renjie, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government.</p>

<h3>Central Army on the Longhai Line Approaches Lanfeng</h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting on Both the Left and Right Wings</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: On the Henan Provincial war situation, the Central Army on the Longhai Line launched a fierce attack on Lanfeng from the 13th onwards, with fierce fighting for days. According to reports from the front, the left-wing troops first attacked south of Lanfeng and broke through two lines of enemy trenches on the 14th and 15th, crossed Dingzhuangzhai and attacked south of Lanfeng Station. The fierce battle has lasted for a week. The right-wing army, after occupying Xin Kao City, advanced westward and attacked the north side of Lanfeng from the north of Neihuang Station. On the 16th, both sides fought fiercely and immediately occupied Yanjiazhai, only 18 li from Lanfeng City. On the 18th, they continued to attack north of Lanfeng City and are still fighting fiercely. According to road reports, the Feng army in Lanfeng has consistently adopted a defensive posture and has no ability to counterattack. Outside the Feng army, there are still some Jin army troops and a unit of Shi Yusan's forces. The Feng army has a total of six lines of trenches on the north and south sides of Lanfeng, so the attack is quite difficult. However, the Central Army is determined to take the offensive in order to coordinate with the progress of the Pinghan Line. The Feng side is already showing signs of being unable to support itself. According to telegrams from the military, the divisions on the left and right wings have linked up and advanced to about 10 li away from the Lanfeng city station by the 20th. The first brigade of the Political Training Propaganda Corps in Guide has separately departed for the front lines to carry out propaganda. (20th)</p>
<h3>Fujian Army to Suppress Lu Continues to Move Out</h3>
<p>Xu Feilong's Troops Surrender to Fang Shengtao</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Yang Shuzhuang, due to internal strife in Lu's troops, specially appointed Liu Heding and Fang Shengtao as commanders of the east and west routes to suppress bandits in northern Fujian, taking advantage of the situation to attack Yanping and Youxi. After Fang Shengtao was appointed, he specially dispatched a military commissioner, Director Wang Mao of the Secretariat, from Quanzhou to the province the other day to contact Yang and Liu to discuss a joint attack plan and request the allocation of military supplies and funds. Fang himself also returned to Quanzhou from Yongchun after attacking Dehua, planning to convene a military conference with Chen Guohui, Xiao Shuxuan, Wang Zuqing, and Lin Qinglong to discuss the strategy of advancing into Datian and capturing Youxi. As for Xu Feilong's troops, after retreating from Dehua to the border of Datian, they garrisoned at the Datian border, but Zhang Tuan of Lu's troops refused their entry to avoid the fleeing soldiers disturbing the area. Xu, having no way to advance or retreat, surrendered to Fang Shengtao and was willing to become a pioneer. Fang believed that Xu's troops were originally combined with Xu Feifeng's troops and had a strength of about a thousand men. If they were sincerely repenting, they could still be used. Yesterday, he telegraphed Yang to ask for instructions. After Liu Heding was appointed, he immediately prepared to mobilize and appointed Deputy Division Commander Yan Er'ai as the front-line commander, ordering him to go to the front line to supervise the battle. Chen Wantai was the commander of the left-wing column, advancing along the Beiling Xinlu, and Gui Zhenyuan was the commander of the right-wing column, advancing along the right bank of the Min River. Liu Shangzhi was the commander of the central column, advancing along the left bank of the Min River, to jointly attack Guanyuan and Dahu. All three routes set off successively on the 19th. It is said that the general attack will begin on the morning of the 21st. Lu Xingrong, because the provincial army is advancing at the same time and internal changes have occurred, feels quite difficult to cope with. In addition to gradually withdrawing the troops along the Min River, he also sent people to persuade Qian Yuguang not to abruptly defect, willing to have Qian succeed to the vacancy of the replenishment brigade commander left by Chen Rongbiao and provide a large number of bullets, but Qian refused. He Jinbiao's troops, entrenched in Zhenghe and Songxi counties, originally formed a mutually supportive force with Lu Xingrong of Dahu and Xu Feilong of Dehua to restrain the provincial army. Now, because Lu and Xu's troops have collapsed and it is difficult to support themselves alone, and because the Second Brigade of the Marine Corps, Lin Bingzhou's unit, has landed in Sandu, Ningde, and is advancing towards Fuan, they have also withdrawn from Song and Zheng counties to Pucheng and Chong'an. Liu Zongyi, the commander of the Second Brigade of the Provincial Police in Shouning and Fuan, has recently planned to lead his troops to enter the defense. (September 20th)</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Fish Merchants' Anti-Taxation Movement</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The local fresh fish merchants' association has expressed its opposition to the Minhou County Education Bureau's creation of a fresh fish education tax of three cents per catty and has launched a strike that has lasted for a week. Both sides have extremely firm attitudes. The fresh fish merchants believe that fresh fish has already been subject to a seafood consumption tax and the burden is too heavy, so they cannot afford to pay the education tax. The Education Bureau believes that the fresh fish merchants used to collect incense money (also three cents per catty) to pay for performances to thank the gods, which was purely superstitious. Now, using this incense money to fund education is justified. At the same time, the Teachers' Union also believes that the income and expenditure of the county's education funds differ by about 2,000 yuan per month, and if a solution is not urgently found, the deficit will deepen and arrears will increase, so they also support the Education Bureau's creation of this tax. Representatives have been elected for days to go to the provincial and county governments and the finance and education departments to request their support for the implementation of the tax. The fresh fish merchants have also submitted petitions to the provincial and county party departments, stating their difficulties and requesting that the government be instructed to abolish the tax. The provincial government is considering whether to restore this tax, which was created once in 1924 and then canceled midway due to the opposition of the fish merchants, so it has not yet made a clear statement. However, in this stalemate, some hawkers are taking the opportunity to profit by secretly buying fish from fishmongers and selling them along the streets. The fish merchants believe that they are undermining the boycott, so they have organized a patrol team to patrol and pour kerosene on any fish carriers they encounter. As a result, disputes have arisen in the market from time to time. In addition to sending a letter to the Public Security Bureau to order the police to stop it at any time, the Education Bureau has also organized a temporary fresh fish consumption cooperative to purchase fish directly from Majiang and Guanjiang and transport them to the province for sale in various important markets in the city to break the fish merchants' boycott. Therefore, the fish merchants held a meeting in a certain fish stall in Jingloumen yesterday to discuss countermeasures. Although some people have come forward to mediate and have the education tax assessed by fish industry contractors, the original operators insist on opposing it because the established situation has been overturned and their rights have been lost, so it may not be easy to resolve.

<h3>Various Circles in Hunan Provide Relief to Refugees in Pingjiang and Liuyang</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The source of the disaster in Hunan Province originated in Pingjiang and Liuyang, spread to eastern Hunan, and gradually occupied the provincial capital and disturbed southern Hunan. Although there are no longer any bandits near the provincial capital, the complete suppression of the province is still pending. Therefore, the refugees who have fled from the disaster are most miserable in Pingjiang and Liuyang. Apart from those who have traveled far to other places to stay with relatives and friends, those who have no clothes, no food, no money, and cannot travel far are crowded in a corner of Changsha in large numbers. In order to prevent problems before they occur, the military and political authorities have not allowed them to stay in the provincial capital and have ordered them all to be sent to the public places on the opposite shore of Yuelu Mountain for accommodation, and have dispatched regimental police to monitor them. At the same time, they have instructed the gentry of Pingjiang and Liuyang provinces to be responsible for investigating whether there are any communist bandits mixed in with the refugees and to implement joint guarantees, with every ten people forming a group and electing a group leader to manage and supervise. As of the 19th, the refugees accommodated included those from Hunan University, the Confucius Temple, the Zhong Kui Temple, the Yunlu Palace, the Guan Di Temple, the Li Gong Temple, the Guanyin Pavilion, the tombs of the Huang and Cai families, the Huang Family Ancestral Hall, the Liao Family Ancestral Hall, the Spinning Mill, Yingwan City, Wangchengpo, and dozens of other places, totaling 2,549 men and 291 women from Pingjiang, and 6,299 men and 1,455 women from Liuyang, a total of 10,594 people, divided into 1,059 groups. Now that the weather is already cold, more than 500 people have become ill from cold and hunger, looking extremely miserable. The Temporary Maintenance Association for Refugees in Pingjiang and Liuyang has appealed to various parties for relief. Therefore, the Hunan Post-Disaster Relief Committee specially convened a temporary meeting and decided on the following relief measures: (1) Clothing: Each person will be given a cotton quilt to keep warm; (2) Food: Each person will be given 50 cents for rice and 140 cash for firewood and vegetables to temporarily alleviate hunger; (3) Housing: Please ask the 31st Division to vacate several rooms of the Hunan University school to avoid sleeping in the open; (4) Medical treatment and coffins: Please ask the Relief Institute to take charge; (5) Funding: Please ask the Provincial Relief Association to borrow 30,000 yuan in relief funds to be used for the first month of relief for the refugees; (6) Appoint Fang Kegang, a member from Pingjiang, and Chen Jieshi, a member from Liuyang, to visit the refugees and be responsible for distributing relief.</p>
<p>At the same time, various charitable organizations in the provincial capital also convened a meeting to discuss relief for the refugees. Representatives from Pingjiang and Liuyang refugees were invited to attend. The following measures were decided: (1) Tea and water problem: It was decided that Feng Zhuowu of the Juehua Charity Hall and Wang Shoumin of the Jishan Xiaobutang would be in charge of handling the area separately; (2) Medical treatment, coffin, and burial problems: It was decided that the Relief Institute would be responsible; (3) Rice straw problem: It was decided that each person would be given two bundles, and Huang Tingshou, Wang Shaoqing, Feng Zhuowu, and Tang Shuyun would be responsible for purchasing them. Wang Yinggeng, Li Dou, Nanfang, Bao Li, and Wu Xiaoqiu would be responsible for distributing them, and the funds would be provided by the Post-Disaster Relief Committee; (4) Housing problem: Negotiations with Hunan University will be conducted to move all outdoor refugees indoors; (5) Maintenance Association operating expenses problem: It was decided that the Post-Disaster Relief Committee would borrow 100 yuan and still require actual reimbursement; (6) Rice distribution problem: It was decided that rice would be received according to regulations, with small groups forming large groups to collect and cook their own food. The pots, steamers, barrels, coal, and other utensils would be provided by the government, and the refugees would elect people to cook the food; (7) Hygiene problem: It was decided to hold the Hygiene Section of the Maintenance Association responsible.

<h3>Zhang Yue Discusses the Current Construction of Shandong Province</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Although the construction expenses in the province for the past year accounted for one-fifth of the province's income (more than 5 million yuan), the achievements in construction have been very few. In addition, the damage caused by the war this summer has wiped out the construction achievements to date. The newly appointed Director of Construction, Zhang Honglie, is currently serving as the Director of the Henan Education Department and the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government in Guide and is unable to come to Jinan to take office. The Provincial Government ordered Zhang Yue, a member of the Provincial Committee, to concurrently serve as Director Zhang. Zhang arrived at the department on the 17th. When the reporter visited him today to inquire about the construction policy, Zhang said that construction is not easy after the war (the Construction Department had a surplus of 370,000 yuan, which was written off by the previous director before leaving) and financial difficulties are enormous. He can only selectively handle matters based on the financial situation. It has now been decided that the first priority is to lay long-distance telephone lines throughout the province in order to suppress bandits, starting with Jiaodong and Luxi. Luxi has a better foundation and sixteen counties have already been connected. Ludong needs to be reinstalled because copper wires are still available, only the cost of installation needs to be raised, and the project can be completed in a short period of time. The second priority is to reorganize the automobile roads to facilitate transportation, starting with the Taiwei, Yanwei, and Lihe roads. However, except for the Yanwei Road, all the vehicles on the roads have been taken away by the military. It is difficult to repair roads and purchase vehicles, and the matter still needs to be submitted to the Provincial Government Standing Committee for resolution. Although water conservancy is important, it is difficult to cook without rice, so it can only be postponed for now. (19th)</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Large Gang of Bandit Ships Discovered Outside Loumen: Yesterday, the 23rd, the Wuxian government received a report from the Chefang District Office outside Loumen that at 2:00 PM on the 17th of this month, 17 bandit ships arrived at the Sangu port in the district with more than 100 bandits. The ships had five blue flags inserted on the bows, with the characters Xu, Zhang, Wang, Zhao, and Pan written on them, with the flag with the character Xu being especially large. The bandits were all wearing miscellaneous uniforms, with red cloths on their chests, holding long guns and short guns, and carrying bayonets on their waists. They spoke various dialects, including Pudong, Jiangbei, Henan, Chaohu, and local dialects. First, they abducted fishermen Song Ma and Zhang Er, who was selling lotus leaves, at that location. Then, they went to the village and abducted Jinlin, son of Wang Yongcheng, and Faxiang, son of Lu Anzu. They rocked the boat and cut off the Wuxian city-township long-distance telephone line at the port and went southwest towards Dayao. New grain is now being harvested, and if they are not suppressed soon, the consequences will be dire. Please send a team to pursue and rescue the hostages, etc. County Magistrate Huang has forwarded the report and has dispatched teams from the police brigade and the water public security district to suppress them.</p>
<p>Raising Customs Revenue Bonds: Wuxian was ordered to raise 250,000 yuan in 19th-year customs revenue bonds and has already remitted 80,000 yuan, with 170,000 yuan still outstanding. The Provincial Government has now ordered the money to be remitted urgently. Director of Finance Yuan Xiaogu believes that the financial situation in Suzhou has been extremely tight recently and that the loans previously borrowed from silver and money merchants have not yet been repaid, making it difficult to raise funds at this time. Therefore, on the 22nd, he submitted a report to the county government, requesting that all agencies be assigned to raise the bonds. It is estimated that 40,000 to 50,000 yuan can be raised this month to remit to the province.</p>
<p>Refugees from Henan Arrive at the Station: At around 2:00 PM on the 23rd, the Suzhou Railway Station was reached by about 100 Henan refugees. The county police team dispatched a team to the scene to suppress them, and then the refugees left Suzhou and went along the railway towards Wuxi.</p>
<p>Provincial Defense Army Opens Fire with Bandit Gang: At 5:00 PM on the 22nd, the Zhejiang Provincial Defense Army opened fire with the Pudong bandit gang at Shangta Zhujiatang for an hour, killing and wounding more than ten bandits. Du Jingwu, the acting captain of the Suzhou Water Police 14th Team, heard the news and led a team to intercept them.</p>
<p>Zhu Xingnan of Jiangyin Arrested in Suzhou: Zhu Gan, courtesy name Xingnan, of Xiagang, Jiangyin, is a wealthy man. After the National Army recovered Jiangyin in the fourth month of last year, after the purge of the party on April 12, Zhu found it difficult to establish himself in Jiangyin and fled abroad, engaging in reactionary activities. He was discovered and arrested by the Public Security Bureau in Suzhou the other day. Zhong Jiehui, the training director of the Jiangyin County Rehabilitation Committee, came to Suzhou after hearing the news to interrogate Zhu with the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Zhu did not admit to reactionary activities and is now being sent to the county for trial.

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Changes to County Public Security Bureau Patrol Officers: Zhu Huanbo, the Director of the County Public Security Bureau, suspected that Wang Huanwen, the patrol officer of the Third Detachment, had covered up illegal cases. Wang also knew that it was difficult to stay in his position and immediately submitted his resignation. After Director Zhu approved it, Ma Changqiu, the patrol officer of the Fifteenth Detachment, was transferred to fill the position, and Li Xinzhi, the patrol officer of Tianma Mountain, was appointed to fill Ma's vacancy. Separate handovers were ordered. As for the vacancy of patrol officer of Tianma Mountain, Director Zhu originally transferred Zhu Biquan, the patrol officer of Xiao Kunshan, to fill the position, but he was accused by local people, who refused to allow Zhu to take office. Therefore, the county bureau changed the appointment to Jiang Shengwu, a special agent, to serve as the patrol officer of Tianma Mountain and approved the former patrol officer's request to add a mining area police station to maintain law and order. The organization was immediately ordered. Since Zhu Biquan had been accused, he was ordered to be transferred to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>Early Payment of Loan Grain Gains Benefits: The county was ordered to raise treasury bonds and had previously been decided by the Public Council to use loan grain to offset the payment. The Finance Bureau ordered the township police to encourage the grain households to raise funds.

The districts are requested to inform the towns and police to quickly comply.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Autumn cocoon trading has successively stopped weighing. In Xiyi County, there are eighty or ninety autumn cocoon trading houses in various villages. Since the opening of the weighing, more than half a month has passed, and the goods on the market are as rare as morning stars. Therefore, each trading house is mutually reselling and collecting cocoons. The price per load is 55 yuan. Some cocoon trading houses have even resold to 60 yuan or 70 yuan. However, the cocoons from the southern region are of poor quality and mixed with summer cocoons. Because each trading house resells and collects cocoons, there is no good prospect for future business. Therefore, starting yesterday, they have successively stopped weighing.</p>
<p>Salt smugglers have once again caused disturbances in the twelfth district. Recently, salt smugglers have frequently caused disturbances in the villages of this county. Villagers are restless. Unexpectedly, yesterday, one hundred and twenty boats of salt smugglers arrived in the twelfth district (Taibo City). All the smugglers and bandits were armed with handguns, Mauser pistols, and other weapons. They went ashore one after another and threatened the residents in every possible way, selling smuggled salt door to door. It is said that one yuan can buy eleven or twelve catties. The general villagers, fearing their ferocity, all paid to buy the salt. Then the salt smuggler boats sailed towards Taihu Lake.</p>
<p>Investigation of police officers for illegal and derelict conduct: Song Shaolun, the patrol chief of the 16th branch of the Anzhen Public Security Bureau in the 8th district (Huaixia City), has been base and undisciplined since he started his service. Unexpectedly, a few days ago, Song colluded with police officer Zhang Ruheng and others to privately take silver coins from Zhang Ajin's home when searching for the medicine ball at Zhang Ajin's home near Cangxia and divided the money among themselves. Yesterday, Zhang Qisen, the chief of the branch bureau, found out that the patrol chief was extremely illegal and derelict in his duties. He immediately suspended him from his duties pending investigation. Liu Dexin, a first-class police officer, was temporarily appointed to replace him.</p>

District Chief Zhang Kui and others telegraphed the provincial government and said that the former police captain Yan Diannan of the subordinate county had now been arrested and the county was overjoyed. It was found that the disaster of bandits in the subordinate county was very deep and the people could not bear their lives. The reason was that the former captain of the brigade was the only one. His crime was extremely heinous and it was not enough to thank the local people without a clear punishment.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>The Donghutou Village was ravaged by bandits. Last night, twenty or thirty bandits suddenly came to Donghutou Village outside the South Gate of Zhenjiang and burned down a civilian house in Pengqiao Village.

The Tongyun small ferry boat traveling between Huaiyin and Suqian, on the upriver trip the day before yesterday (the 18th), had just reached the Wuyutang area, eight or nine miles away from Sucheng. The sky was getting late (around 7 o'clock). More than a dozen bandits suddenly came from the shore, each holding a box gun, opened fire on the ship, and ordered it to stop. After the ship stopped, each bandit jumped on board and carried out a search and robbery, which lasted for one or two hours.

Fortunately, the exported boxed tea was intercepted and secretly robbed by bandits on both sides of the Widow Bridge, twenty miles downstream of Leping.

<p>Issued by the Ministry of Education</p>
<h3>Questionnaire on the Allocation of Regular Expenses for Middle Schools</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education wants to know the actual situation of regular expenses of schools in various places in order to stipulate the allocation standard of regular expenses for ordinary middle schools. It issued a questionnaire on the allocation of regular expenses for middle schools and ordered the Education Departments of the 14 provinces including Jiangsu and the Education Bureaus of the five municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan. It said that schools in various places often have many difficulties because of insufficient funds, meager salaries for teachers, and simple teaching equipment. Financial difficulty is certainly the main reason for the difficulty in running schools, but the way the funds are allocated is also closely related to the achievements of the school. The appropriate or inappropriate allocation of the same amount of funds will obviously show the difference between being sufficient and being insufficient.</p>
<p>The school is a place for teaching, and its expenses should naturally be used for teaching. The reasons for being a teacher are one for tutors and one for tools. Therefore, most of the school's expenses should be the salaries of teachers, and a small part should be used for books, instruments, all scientific and work equipment, and various experimental consumption. Only a very small part is the necessary office expenses for the school. In this way, the efficiency of teaching can be substantial and great, and the expenses will not be wasted. However, in general, the amount of expenses occupied by teaching equipment and experiments is very small, which is very different from office expenses. In addition to reading a few textbooks, students read very few books. Scientific experience is very incomplete, and all work equipment is extremely simple, or even non-existent. As a result, young people's interest in academics is extremely weak, and the desire for scientific exploration will never occur. The propaganda of heresies takes advantage of this opportunity. The increasing number of young people who have gone astray is also a major reason for the corruption of school operators themselves. The Ministry is now planning to stipulate the allocation standard of regular expenses for ordinary middle schools for correction, but it must first know the actual situation of the allocation of regular expenses of schools in various places for reference. Therefore, it has issued a questionnaire to investigate the allocation of regular expenses for middle schools and asks the "Department" and "Bureau" to forward it to public and registered private middle schools to fill it out in accordance with the text. Within one month, the department will send it to the department for compilation, which is of utmost importance (questionnaire on the allocation of regular expenses for middle schools will continue to be published)</p>

<h3>Schools to be Inspected by the Municipal Education Bureau this Week</h3>
<p>The staff of the Inspection Department of the Municipal Education Bureau of this city were dispatched this week to inspect the municipal and established primary schools and Zhou Middle School.

<h3>Order to Collect Public Opinions from Schools</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Education Bureau yesterday instructed schools at all levels that the publicity department of the County Rectification Committee issued a public letter stating that the Jiangsu Party Affairs Weekly published by the Provincial Party Headquarters of this province is well-edited and widely circulated, and is the only effective publication of this party. The department has previously submitted a request to add a "Public Opinion" column in the publication to allow the public in the province to express their opinions. It has been approved by Order No. 147 and notified to the publicity departments of the party headquarters of all counties in the province to collect materials for selection and publication. It is found that this county is the cultural center of the whole province, and the public's knowledge is higher than that of the general public. They must have something to say about the local government affairs of this province. Schools distributed throughout the county are in contact with the public every day and are the best agency for collecting public opinion. All teachers and staff in schools are enthusiastic about this work and must be happy to engage in it. They are specifically requested to ask the school principals to collect public opinions from the public at any time and send notes to the Ministry of Education for forwarding and selection. Therefore, public opinions can be communicated. There are also many cases in which regulations are not followed and stamps are not affixed. This not only damages the national treasury revenue, but also hinders the inculcation of the concept of affixing stamps and the formation of popular habits. Please forward this to all schools to ensure that all receipts and certificates mentioned above are affixed and used in accordance with the regulations to maintain the national treasury and implement the laws. After approving the consultation, the Municipal Government has transferred the order to the Education Bureau for all schools to comply with it.</p>

<h3>Provincial Schools Scheduled to Open</h3>
<p>Jinan Express News: Due to the impact of military affairs, the provincial schools in Shandong have not opened after the summer vacation due to lack of funds. The education authorities previously ordered the schools to jointly run remedial classes to remedy the students who lost their studies due to the excessive number of young people who lost their studies. Although the benefits were many, it was difficult for a clever woman to cook without rice. After Han Fu took office as Chairman of Lu, Education Director He Siyuan submitted a proposal on maintaining education funds and allocating funds to open schools to the Provincial Government Committee on the 16th. The proposal was approved and the Finance Department allocated 30,000 yuan for education on the 17th, which was distributed to provincial schools. It was also stipulated that all schools would open on the 26th of this month. The current difficulty felt by the schools is that many teachers in the school have already taken up jobs in various places because the opening of schools is uncertain. They are now urging students from outside counties to return to their hometowns by letter. It is difficult for them to arrive at the opening of schools. On the 19th, the Provincial Government Committee approved the use of Qingdao goods tax funds to fill the Shandong Province Education Fund to avoid the impact of military affairs on education. Education Director He Siyuan immediately rushed to Qingdao from Jinan at 11 pm on the 19th to discuss the matter and participate in the opening ceremony of Qingdao University on the 20th.</p>

<p>The Chinese Football Association Committee held its first meeting at the Great China Restaurant on Szechuan Road at 7 p.m. last night.  The meeting lasted for three hours, during which the committee discussed matters such as finalizing the current season's competition schedule, approving new members, and assigning teams to various groups. Those in attendance were Shen Guoquan, Yao Xiurong, Ma Detai, Shen Kunnan, Wu Yanzhang, Hao Boyang, and Zhou Jiaqi.  The committee members first elected Yao Xiurong as chairman.  The resolved minutes are recorded as follows: (1) Given the large number of members this season, the competition method should be changed from previous years to allow for an early conclusion. The groups will still be divided into five for the "Chinese Football Association," but in addition to the two Chinese groups, the remaining three groups will each be further divided into Part 1 and Part 2. The winners of each part will compete in a final to determine the group champion. (2) The constitution was approved (to be published later). (3) The membership fee for new members remains the same, but the registration fee for each team is increased to five yuan. (4) The competition will begin on October 11th. (5) Strict regulations should be implemented to prevent teams from forfeiting matches. (6) Any team found to be using imposters or unregistered players in matches will be immediately expelled from the association, as such actions are a violation of sporting ethics. (7) The team assignments for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Group (10 teams): Hua Group (9 teams): Foot Group (12 teams): Youth Xuhui (Part 1) (Part 2) San Yi Qinghua Friendship Hua Ling Jia You Xingguang Jia Hu Jian Jinde Fudan Jia Fudan Yi Beicheng Zhendan Yi Lingnan Jia Dongya Xingguang Yi Qingjun Zhendan Jia Zhixing Dajiang Yasai Baota Jia Hua Ling Jia Meifu Jia Yingmei Jia  Zhen Ru Lingnan Yi</p>
<p>Le Yi Dongfang</p>
<p>Tongji</p>
<p>Ball Group (13 teams): Association Group (20 teams): (Part 1) (Part 2) (Part 1) (Part 2) Guangyi Jingxiong Shenbao Zhonghang Sai Yuan Tian Fang Mian Chang Tu Luxing</p>
<p>Hurriedly appearing, he seemed flustered. His serves lacked precision, and he lost many points. Qiu, on the other hand, was cautious, winning four consecutive games. Yuan initially gained an advantage with his serves, but Qiu won the subsequent two games. As a result, Qiu Feihai won with a score of six to one.</p>
<h3>Harada vs. Lin Baohua</h3>
<p>Six to one, Lin wins.</p>
<p>After the match with Qiu, Harada continued to play against Lin Baohua. At this time, Harada's spirits seemed to have recovered slightly, and his serves were more accurate. His volleys were also well-placed. Lin did not dare to relax. Lin served first, attacking twice, rendering Harada helpless. After a long battle, Lin won the first game. Harada, relying on his serves, won the second game outright. Subsequently, Lin often volleyed at the net, and Harada volleyed forcefully. However, Lin won five consecutive games, resulting in a six to one defeat for Harada.</p>
<h3>Doubles Match</h3>
<p>Six to two, Lin and Qiu win.</p>
<p>After the two singles matches, after a short rest, Harada teamed up with our compatriot Jiang Daozhang to play against Lin and Qiu. Lin and Qiu cooperated well, but Jiang Daozhang was timid, resulting in poor coordination between the two. Lin and Qiu won the first five games. Harada then made a strong comeback, winning two games. However, Lin and Qiu ultimately won with a score of six to two.</p>
<h3>Jiang Daozhang vs. Oka</h3>
<p>Six to one, Jiang wins.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the originally scheduled match between Harada and Mr. Tawaraya was changed because Tawaraya had not yet arrived. Jiang Daozhang was then invited to play a friendly singles match against Japanese expatriate Mr. Oka. The two played quite brilliantly. Jiang Daozhang's skills had improved. After a set, Jiang Daozhang won with a score of six to one.</p>
<h3>Harada vs. Tawaraya</h3>
<p>Six to three, six to two, Harada wins.</p>
<p>Harada, having rested for some time, was in better spirits. He finally played a singles match against Mr. Tawaraya. Mr. Tawaraya was a player in the Japan Taiwan Cup two years ago and possessed highly refined skills. Harada used all his strength to compete. Each hit demonstrated true skill and power. His forehand volleys were accurate, and his chops were also good. His serves were steady. Tawaraya did not show weakness, and the two battled fiercely, producing many brilliant moments. Harada was full of ingenuity, placing the ball far and near, tiring Tawaraya out. As a result, Harada won two consecutive sets, six to three and six to two. The audience applauded greatly. By the time all the matches were over, the sun had set. That evening, the Japanese Expatriate Tennis Association held a meeting to welcome Harada. It was learned that Harada will be taking a ship to Japan today.</p>

<h3>Amateur Tennis Match at City Stadium</h3>
<p>Another amateur tennis match was held at the City Public Stadium yesterday. The participants were Tang Zhiming and Xi Zhenyi against Jiang Tianpeng and Qian Zhongxuan. These two teams, along with the He Chunhui and He Erkun team and the Guo Qida and Lu Weisen team, had previously achieved the best records over the past week, each losing only once, and their scores were also equal. Therefore, they all had hopes of winning the championship. The battle yesterday was naturally particularly intense. In the first set, Jiang and Qian initially dominated, but Tang, playing at the net, and Gong, rallying from the back, complemented each other well. After a long and fierce battle, news came that Jiang and Qian had lost the first set, two to six. In the second set, Jiang and Qian seemed to improve, and the number of games increased, creating a stalemate. However, in the last ten minutes, Tang and Gong suddenly displayed great energy, winning three consecutive games and winning the set again, six to four, thus achieving complete victory.

<h3>A Word of Wisdom</h3>
<p>— Qiu Shui</p>
<p>Every man has three hands: one hand for money, one hand for women, and one hand for reputation. Women also have three hands: one hand for pleasure, one hand for adornment, and one hand for life.</p>
<p>Modern mothers are like fathers and cannot often be at home. If you see her, you leave her, and you won't see her. Even when you want her, she is not there.</p>
<p>Many women, after marrying a man, hope to be his guide, his philosopher, and a good friend. But in reality, they only become his alarm clock, his food taster, and his housekeeper.</p>
<p>After newlyweds spend their honeymoon, the most important thing is to use a fine net to cover their expected hopes, preventing them from escaping.</p>
<p>The basis of male beauty lies in his personality, his barbershop, his clothing, and his safety razor.</p>
<p>The greatest danger between married men and women is always due to the following two reasons: the first is due to the man's mistakes, and the second is due to the woman's faults.</p>
<p>A man cannot have two opposing thoughts in his mind unless they are about two women of different complexions who are both extremely beautiful.</p>
<p>A betrothal ring and a wedding ring are vastly different. The difference is like that between a promissory note and a banknote.</p>
<p>If you are unfortunate enough to fall out of love, you don't have to look for reasons elsewhere. Just take a mirror, look at your face, and feel your wallet.</p>
<p>Love is like reading a magical novel to a woman, eagerly wanting to see the ending. However, love for a man does not care about the outcome, being satisfied with the present situation and the present happiness.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Records of Commemorations of the Martyr Zhu Zhixin by Various Circles</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Various circles in this city held a grand meeting at the Republican Theater on Republic Road in the South City on the 21st of this month to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the martyrdom of Zhu Zhixin. The general situation has already been recorded in this newspaper. I will supplement the trivial matters seen on that day as follows:</p>
<p>On that day, a white cloth banner was hung high at the entrance of the venue, which read: "Shanghai People from All Walks of Life Commemorate the Tenth Anniversary of Mr. Zhu Zhixin's Martyrdom." The Party and National flags were intertwined. The police officers dispatched by the First District and Second Precinct of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Boy Scouts of the Trade Union Secretaries Training Institute stood on both sides, looking very solemn. After entering the venue, representatives from all walks of life signed their names and were given a paper detailing the reasons for commemorating the martyr Zhu Zhixin, which was written and printed by the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee. It detailed Mr. Zhu's involvement in the Chinese Tongmenghui while studying in Tokyo, Japan, his advocacy for revolution in the Minbao newspaper, and his secret gathering of comrades to mobilize revolutionary elements in the Army Rapid Training School, Humen Military Academy, and Student Army Camp in Guangzhou five years before the founding of the Republic of China, creating a new army revolutionary force. In the same year, because the Premier's uprising in Zhennanguan failed, Mr. Zhu and his comrades actively mobilized local armies in various places to plot the occupation of Guangzhou. On September 21, 1920, because the Gui warlords were rampant, he disregarded the danger and went to Humen to plot the alliance of local armies to eliminate the Gui clique. He was ambushed by the Gui rebels less than half a mile away from the Humen Fortress Command. On the stage, the order of events and slogan sheets were posted next to the Premier's portrait. Two tables were set up in the middle, one for speeches and one for records, both surrounded by white cloth, looking very bleak. On that day, female comrades accounted for three-tenths of the representatives in terms of gender, those wearing student uniforms and Chinese suits accounted for about seven-tenths in terms of clothing, and those wearing long robes accounted for only three-tenths. In terms of age, those under 20 years old accounted for three-tenths, those under 30 years old accounted for six-tenths, those under 40 years old accounted for one-tenth, and there were not many over 40 years old. Mr. Xu, the master of ceremonies, spoke in a loud voice, which was very inspiring. Yang Qingyuan, the Minister of Propaganda, reported on the purpose of the meeting, first stating that Mr. Zhu's learning was vast, then stating that Mr. Zhu was brave in the revolution, and finally stating that Mr. Zhu was frugal and self-disciplined and willing to help his comrades. Yuan Yuanbenben can be used as a biography of Mr. Zhu. Tao Baichuan's speech stated that Mr. Zhu had many virtues that could be used as examples for future generations, and that the most needed people in the Kuomintang now are those who are selfless, so he extracted a little bit from Mr. Zhu's virtues to extend and explain them, so as to be admired. Mr. Zhu's life career was completely a public word, so he was willing to not avoid danger and sacrifice himself to become benevolent. His articles and conversations with people all said that revolutionary party members should be prepared to die at any time and any place in order to fight for the country. This shows that he had already made up his mind to sacrifice his body for the benefit of the country and the nation, so when he was ordered to go to Humen to contact the local army, he knew that the Gui warlords were treacherous or would be harmed, but he was willing to go into the tiger's mouth to try to succeed, then eliminate the Gui system and eliminate harm for the people, and if he failed, he would sacrifice himself to encourage later deaths. Selfless dedication deserves commemoration. All our party members should encourage themselves, and so on, which won thunderous applause. Then shout slogans and dismiss the meeting.</p>
<h3>The Fake Kerosene Well That Was Widely Publicized Throughout the Province</h3>
<p>— Xuan Xuan Zhai Zhu</p>
<p>There is a well in front of the home of Gong Yinglan in Tianzhuang Town, Fifth District, Changshu. It has been there for many years, and the water quality is clear, and the whole family relies on it for drinking water. Suddenly, a month ago, the water drawn from it contained kerosene. Upon inspection, the water was still clear, but there was oil floating on the surface of the water. When paper was dipped into it and ignited, it burned, proving that it was kerosene. As a result, the discovery of a kerosene well caused a sensation throughout the town. The matter was reported to the Department of Agriculture and Mines, which ordered the county to investigate the facts and draw two bottles of well water for chemical testing. However, according to science, the raw material of kerosene is not pure in color and only becomes so after refining. The well water of the Gong family is already oil without refining, and only a thin layer floats on the surface of the water. There is already reason to suspect that the bottom layer of the stacked kerosene in the kerosene depot of Sun Zhengda, which is next to the well, has rusted through, and the oil has seeped into the soil and flowed into the Gong family's well, causing the misunderstanding that a kerosene well had been discovered. The Gong family has now closed the well and does not want anyone else to go there to investigate.</p>
<h3>Jottings from Roaming Around</h3>
<p>— Song Lu</p>
<p>Previously, I had compiled and published "Miscellaneous Jottings from Roaming Around" in this journal. Now, I have continued to remember and supplement it to provide readers with conversation aids.</p>
<p>Shanghai rickshaws are silent, while those in Hangzhou ring a bell, and those in Suzhou honk a horn, swaggering through the city. The sound is like that of a car. The rickshaws in Jiashan, Shaoxing, and other places are all tied with a bell, and when walking, they are like donkeys and horses galloping.</p>
<p>A restaurant in Shaoxing has a dish called "Stir-fried Soldiers," which is strange to its name. I tried it, and it turned out to be stir-fried shrimp and crab. Gu Ming Si Yi smiled at it, and the taste was very fresh and delicious.</p>
<p>One night, I stayed at Wangdian (east of Jiaxing) and went to a small shop to drink. I tried to order a stir-fried shredded meat. Soon, the waiter brought it out, and the dish was still boiling on the plate. It tasted delicious and fresh, something I had never had before.</p>
<p>All those who travel to Hangzhou praise the beauty of Hangzhou's fresh shrimp. In fact, it is far inferior to Linping (a town in Hangzhou County). Linping's shrimp is not only fresh and alive, but also prepared in a way that it tastes like eating a honey pear.</p>
<p>Traveling from Shaoxing to Lanting, donkeys are used for transportation. Donkeys are also used for transportation when traveling to Tiger Hill in Suzhou. However, the donkeys in Suzhou are far inferior to those in Lanting. The donkeys in Lanting can travel fifty miles in an hour, which is faster than a thoroughbred horse. Moreover, there is no need for servants to accompany them, and there is no danger of getting lost. The spirituality of animals is also amazing.</p>
<h3>Competing to Talk About Fashion at the Great New Store</h3>
<p>— Ping Mei</p>
<p>The Great New Silk and Satin Bureau, which has always been known for promoting domestic silk and satin, expanded its business and moved to its new location on Shisan Road. It opened yesterday. Before the opening ceremony, two or three hundred people had already gathered at the entrance of the bureau, waiting. Because the bureau invited famous ladies from Shanghai to hold the opening ceremony, even more people flocked to visit.</p>
<p>At the opening ceremony, Madam Yan Duhe, Madam Yan Esheng, and other ladies arrived one after another, all wearing domestic fashion. Madam Pan's clothing material was purchased from the bureau five days ago, and the tailoring method was also contributed by the bureau's new clothing department, which was very elegant and generous. Ms. Xu Shuzhen was unable to come in person due to Liu Jiwen's slight illness.</p>
<p>Madam Wang Yansong was in charge of receiving the female guests, her face full of spring breeze and her smile very kind. Madam Wang is the most enthusiastic about promoting domestic goods, and even the shoes she wears are domestic shoes. It is said that she never wears leather shoes.</p>
<p>On that day, the bureau's new clothing department launched a total of 84 fashion items, 21 of which were ordered by famous Shanghai ladies to participate in the Domestic Goods Fashion Show at the Great China Hotel on October 9. In addition, a female student from Zhejiang University, Zhang, came all the way from Hangzhou to order two fashion items from the bureau, which can be said to be a special belief in the bureau.</p>
<p>In addition to the new clothing department's thick album of new fashion styles for all walks of life to choose from and order, the silk and satin aspect also has many special patterns, such as peach blossom silk, flower fragrance plum cable silk, Wenxia Gejin silk, etc., which are either rich and beautiful or elegant and long, all with dazzling beauty.</p>
<p>On that day, people from all walks of life went to congratulate them in an endless stream, and there were also many gifts, all of whom were Shanghai celebrities and business leaders. Yu Qiaqing said to the director of the bureau, Wang Yansong, "You have just been appointed as the reorganization committee member of the China Merchants Bureau and will surely be able to reorganize the bureau in the same way as the Great New Store." Mr. Wang also accepted it with a smile.</p>
<h3>Nanyang Travel Notes (58)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>Yangon not only produces stone but also jadeite. Mr. Chen Kaiqing is in the jadeite business in Burma. It is said that a Westerner once obtained a piece of jadeite in a certain place in Yunnan, which was worth 100,000 yuan. It was difficult to transport it out of the country. It was transported to Europe, where a jade craftsman cut out one-thirtieth of it to make three Buddha statues. One Buddha statue was sold to a rich nobleman for 300,000 yuan. It was also lucky. However, the import taxes of various countries are heavy. A Buddha statue worth tens of yuan in Nanyang is worth 200 yuan in Taiwan because of heavy taxes. The aspect of the Westerners' buddhification is that many cultures have been accepted since the input into England from India. There are also many English Buddhist books of all sizes. Overseas Chinese students in Nanyang cannot read Chinese books and only read English books. The Buddhist Research Society in Penang can read English Buddhist scriptures and even praise the English's Buddhism as being more prosperous than that of China. According to this true taste of the culture of the motherland (some overseas Chinese students call the motherland the United Kingdom, and China is called Tangshan).</p>
<p>The reason for human feelings is observation and exchange of assimilation. Imitation is the nature of man. By observing the good imitation of monkeys, we know that human evolution comes from imitation. Therefore, all Western merchants, officials, men and women who have lived in China for a long time like to decorate their rooms in the Chinese style, such as Buddha statues, etc. Although they do not necessarily believe in them, they also like to display them, and those of us who go to Europe and the West also become infected with the Western style. This is a habit of mutual admiration and imitation. During the Guangxu period, an American warship passed through Xiamen and gave three large jade Buddha statues to Nanputuo Temple in Xiamen. They still exist today. This also shows that Westerners are very interested in Buddha statues.</p>
<p>The 25th newspaper reported that Indian women will convene the Asian Women's Congress. Previously, a Westerner passed through Singapore and was a liberator of the movement to remarry widows. These are all news here, and Mr. Briand, the former French Prime Minister and now the Foreign Minister, advocated improving women's education to promote world peace and further issued a notice to organize the European Federation. I have pressed Mr. Morgan's Morgan said that the ancient social organization was based on the physiology of the two sexes. The era was the matriarchal system.</p>
<p>According to Mr. K's theory of mutual aid, the establishment of the family is a late development. At first, it was a group life, and it was all maternal. At that time, there were very few social wars. After the Great War, the death of males decreased, and the ratio of English women to men was six to five, and the French was seven to five. There were more German deaths and should be six to four. That is, from 1929, there were 11 million English men with the right to vote, while women had 13.24 million. In French law, only five husbands in seven women and two other women can not be matched with men. There is no exact number for Germany and Russia, and the number of men must be less than that of France. In fact, the number of males in the world is sharply reduced. Even with equal elections, it will become a ratio of four to six or at least 55 to 45. This is a good proof that my number of world femaleized federations can lead to world peace. However, if men have another great war, at least the world's males who die will be tens of millions or more, and orphans and widows will collect the remaining bones and become a female world government. Today, the French Briand only knows how to form a European Federation, and Americans also want to form the Pan-American Federation. Why not go a step further and form a world federation? It is also a pity that he still does not know how to use the majority of women in the world.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (284)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Green Bamboo Tears Stain the Lady's Heart, Red Lotus Fragrance Fades, a Daughter's Soul Departs</p>
<p>At that time, Cuiyun also put forward several conditions, such as not kowtowing upon entering the door, addressing the women on his side as sisters, and having a formal room of her own. As long as you said it, Zhang Yiqing could completely agree. Cuiyun did not put forward any harsh requirements, thinking that if there was harmony, living in a family would be a pleasure of family harmony. Before entering the house, Zhang Yiqing also spent a lot of discussion. At that time, his woman was also planning to take the first step, coaxing her into the house and then saying everything. She also agreed. When she talked about not kowtowing upon entering the door, she said, "What's wrong with kowtowing once? Does kowtowing once add a piece of flesh?" When she addressed her sisters, she was a little unhappy because she was afraid that this condition would create obstacles and stop the progress. She said, "It doesn't matter what she likes to call me. I won't argue about what she calls me." This matter was also reluctantly passed. As for the condition of formally wanting a room, it seemed too small, and Cuiyun should not have raised it, which shows that she did not think highly of herself. However, Cuiyun had a little sister who was also someone else's concubine, but she lived in the back room of the first wife, and the door of that room was blocked by a pile of boxes. Anyone who wanted to go to the concubine's room had to go through the first wife's room. The concubine's mouth was blocked by them, and all the entrances and exits were completely blocked. And they said that when the old master wanted to go to the concubine's room, he had to go through the first wife's room. The ancients had a way of passing through to attack Guo. Sometimes the old master was intercepted by the first wife. There was also an annoying thing. The front and back rooms were only separated by a layer of wooden boards. The old master was in the first wife's room, and no one cared about him. If he was in the concubine's room, he didn't even dare to speak loudly, just like the Taoist scholars who wrote merit and demerit grids in the past. In a dark room, there is always a god who can see. Sometimes, at the midnight when the fragrant dreams returned, I heard the slight turning and slight sighing from the front room, which seemed to make people shudder. Some of the more fierce big ladies felt a sense of the end of the world at a close distance. They borrowed something to summon their old master over and used the tactic of luring the tiger away from the mountain. Therefore, they felt that it was always inappropriate for others to snore beside the couch. Cuiyun heard people say this and knew that she would inevitably talk about the tiger when she met that kind of tigress, so she also listed the room as a condition. However, there was no problem in Zhang Yiqing's old home. Originally, their house was three floors and three bottoms, which was very spacious. His woman said that this also became a problem. The room opposite was originally empty. Just let her move over to live in the opposite room. All the furniture in the room was originally moved over when you rented the small public house, so there is no need to add anything else. His woman wanted to implement the first step of everything, so there was always room for negotiation.</p>

<h3>Business News</h3>
<p>Financial Silver Bar Stability</p>
<p>Daily Fluctuations Total Six Taels and Three Mace; Yesterday's Silver Bar Shifted from Weak to Strong</p>
<p>The psychology of fellow traders inevitably showed a somewhat flustered attitude. Although there were no major changes, the morning and afternoon markets still had fluctuations of three or four taels. The overall market fluctuated by about six taels. In retrospect, the market ultimately rose slightly, with the market atmosphere remaining calm, while exchange rates slightly eased. Banks' appetite to buy was not weak. Inside the exchange, various brokers were active in transactions. Zhifeng Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, and Yuan Jin had varying degrees of buying in, with quite large amounts. Jui Tai, Fu Chang, Yi Yu, Yuan Xing, and Yong Kang all had buying activity. Yong Cheng Chang, Xie Yu, Chun Yuan Yong, and others were mainly selling. As for the silver market, it rose again after opening low and fluctuating, suddenly plummeting to 34 taels. Afterwards, it turned moderate again, likely due to diverse buying interests. Speculators took the opportunity to purchase, subsequently pushing the price up by three or four taels. As the buying momentum increased in the afternoon market, Cheng Feng Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Cheng Yong, and others all made purchases. However, the selling side, Dalian groups and retail investors, had foreign exchange rates that remained strong, with banks continuing to absorb, causing the market to surge and rapidly breach the 40-tael mark. The spot price was about 30 taels higher than the forward price.</p>
<p>Opening Down Four Taels in the Morning, the January Silver Bar Opened at 535 Taels and Three Mace, a Decrease of Four Taels and Two Mace (Though a Gross Price Reached Over 37 Taels and Then Returned to Over 5 Taels). The reason was that short-term swaps had recently increased by 1.875, and long-term swaps by 1.25, with the silver price increasing by 0.25. Especially in the European market, demand exceeded supply. Subsequently, there was a fluctuation of two taels, falling from 36 taels to 4 taels. Swap trades by Zhitai Yong and others had some selling, and fellow traders sold to the Yokohama Specie Bank, with December British gold calculated at 8 pence for 1.875. HSBC also sold next month's Citibank at $40.0625, causing weak sentiment. Initially, the price was announced at 35 taels and 34 mace, increasing to 6 taels and 8 mace, with Jui Tai and others seeking to buy. Banks also traded among themselves, with January British gold at 8 pence for 1.875, and December Citibank at $40.0875. Soon after, it retreated by over one tael, to 5 taels and 78 mace. After 9:30, it seemed to show an upward trend, but with only a slight increase. Yuan Cheng Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, and Yuan Xing Yong all bought in, and the exchange rates followed closely. Banks mutually traded December Citibank at $40.075, and September British gold was calculated at 8 pence. Then, the Banque Belge pour l'Etranger and the Yokohama Specie Bank mutually traded October at 8 pence, with December at 1.25 available for sale. Thus, the gold price soared by two taels and several mace, reaching 38 taels and 4 mace at 11:00. After entering, it fell slightly by one or two taels. At noon, it was 6 taels and a half, with some people selling. At noon closing, the price was announced at 6 taels and 6 mace, 597 taels, a decrease of about 61 taels, to over 58 taels. At midday, it was 60 taels.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Trend Was Firm, Resulting in a Slight Increase. The afternoon market opened at 37 taels and two mace. Afterwards, it gradually rose, with only a slight fluctuation. Cheng Feng Yong, Yuan Cheng Yong, and Yuan Mao Yong competed to buy, and the exchange rate also strengthened. Mitsui bought next month's Japanese gold at 1.04375 taels, so the gold price surged to 39 taels and 4 mace at 3:20. After more than twenty minutes, it retreated by seven or eight mace, as the Indian exchange rate showed a large increase of two onzas, at 38 taels and 67 mace. At 4:15, Yuan Mao Yong and Yuan Cheng Yong repeatedly bought, especially with the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China buying December British gold at 8 pence and 1.125. Sentiment grew even stronger, causing a surge of one tael and five or six mace, already rising to 40 taels and three mace. At this time, retail investors sold, pushing it down to 39 taels and 67 mace. At the 4:30 closing, it was 539 taels and 9 mace, an increase of four mace compared to the previous day. The maximum price for the day was 40 taels and 3 mace, the minimum price was 30 taels, totaling 6 taels and 3 mace in fluctuations. The announced prices ranged from a decrease of 60 taels to 57 taels.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Market Trends Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's posted exchange rates remained unchanged. However, overseas silver markets showed rising signs again, and the market situation was flat with active buyers offsetting short positions. British-American exchange rates both decreased, while Japanese-American rates increased. Reuters' dispatches showed no increases or decreases. As for internal bank rates, they slightly retreated and then remained flat. The afternoon seemed stable, likely due to the upward and downward trends in the silver bar market, fluctuating by six taels throughout the day. However, the wind was calm and the result was a slight increase. The final price of each exchange rate was higher than the previous day, with both British and American exchanges increasing by 0.0625, while Japanese gold showed no gains or losses. Chinese merchants' transactions were still swift, with British gold sales totaling over ten thousand pounds. Banks such as the Yokohama Specie Bank, the Bank of Chosen, and the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China had all absorbed and their appetite was not weak. In the afternoon, Tai Kang Run and others had settled in several thousand pounds, sold by Banque Franco-Chinoise and Banque Belge pour l'Etranger. Various banks mutually traded 100,000 pounds in swap trades. In American dollars, $200,000 were mutually traded, with Chinese merchants handling about $200,000 in inflows and outflows. HSBC sold, while Mitsui bought. However, Japanese gold only had minor inflows and outflows. The Chase Bank slightly sold in the morning, and Mitsui slightly bought in the afternoon. The Bank of Chosen dropped December Japanese-American exchange rates at $49.4375 in the afternoon, which Cheng Feng Yong bought. The market situation was still calm and sentiment turned from poor to firm.</p>
<h3>Major Swap Trades Recover and Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to London dispatches, major swap trades suddenly recovered due to short covering, with the market flat. However, there were very few sell positions. Short-term increases were 1.875, and long-term deliveries were 1.25, both at 17 pence (equivalent to British gold at 1 shilling and 8 pence and 1.125). In addition, according to New York dispatches, the American silver price increased by 0.25 to $3.6875. The British-American exchange rate decreased by 0.0625 to $4.86. The American-British exchange rate fell by 0.09375 to $4.8596875. Japanese-American increased by 0.0625 to $49.50. British-Indian remained at 2 shillings and 0.4375.

<h3>Reaction After the Continuous Rise in Foreign Cents</h3>
<p>The highest point was a fall of three and a half cents compared to the previous day, and the silver discount also slightly declined. Market Overview Yesterday, the foreign exchange market suddenly reversed and the decline was quite sharp, with the difference between the high and low prices of the previous day reaching three and a half cents. The main reason was that banks stopped buying and the previous few days had seen excessive gains, resulting in a reaction. However, looking at the future trend, it is likely still upward. The current retreat is nothing more than a relationship between supply and demand in the market. The actual situation confirms that there is a good chance that the silver standard will remain strong and will not be able to soften. It is also feared that it will tend to be higher.</p>
<p>Cent Discount Prices "Foreign Cents" The morning cent price was suddenly 0.625 cents lower than the low price of the previous day's midday market, at 7 mace, 3 cents, 4 li and 7 hao and a half.

The result was a difference of three and a half cents from the highest price in the morning market of the previous day.

The Guangdong small foreign coin in the morning market was 6 mace, 4 cents and 0 li and 2 hao and a half, and the midday market was 6 mace, 3 cents, 9 li and 6 hao and 2 hu and a half, a slight decrease of one li compared to the market conditions of the previous day. 135,000 jiao were transacted in the morning market and 80,000 jiao in the midday market. Copper coins suddenly shrank by 3,500 to a new low of 381,000. Therefore, the exchange rate was already within 2,800 characters.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflows and Outflows "Silver Funds" Yesterday, the bank's collection and release of funds was simple and appropriate, slightly better than usual. Chinese merchants collected and released 2.7 to 2.8 million in bills, foreign merchants collected and released 2.2 to 2.3 million in bills, special funds of over 2 million, and various commodity exchange tax miscellaneous funds collected and released 1.01 million. 1.2 million was deposited into the warehouse and 400,000 was released from the warehouse.

Inflows and outflows between foreign accounts of various banks totaled over 1.5 million, with 1.5 to 1.6 million in banknote inflows and outflows. The source of customer routes was still quiet, with only 240,000 from Hangzhou currency and over 500,000 collected from the street.</p>
<p>Rumor has it that 700,000 to 800,000 are being shipped out. Qianzhuang and foreign public exchanges collected and released over 4.8 million in single exchanges, and over 230,000 in foreign markup funds. The foreign fund discount was over 1.2 million, and small qianzhuang collected and exchanged banknotes and sold foreign exchange transactions worth 600,000 to 700,000.</p>
<p>Securities and Bond Markets Were Peaceful</p>
<p>Yesterday, the futures market for various public bonds suddenly turned quiet, with far fewer transactions than before. Only current goods, such as streamlining the military and demobilization, were opened, while the rest had no transactions. The trend of various bonds was due to large accounts watching, and the balance of supply and demand was fluctuating with no major changes. As a result, in addition to streamlining the military and demobilization current goods falling by one yuan and several jiao, and the demobilization October futures rose by four jiao, although the others continued to weaken uniformly, the number was only two or three jiao. Total current goods transactions for the day were only 2,400 yuan, and futures were 9.72 million yuan.</p>
<p>Bond categories opened before and closed after. Previous day's transaction volume was weak.</p>

<p>The yarn market turned weak because the continuous rise in recent days was too intense, causing profit-takers to close out, and the Osaka Sanpin suddenly plummeted, with the far month falling below the previous day's price. It is said that the original factory has thick yarn reserves. Although the situation is optimistic, there should be a fluctuation between 54 and 55 taels, so the market atmosphere is stable. When retail investors enter the market, the market falls. However, Xinchenghao's daily intake is about 10,000 packages, and the market price has not been stimulated, which shows the great effect of people's hearts. However, some people who open Japanese yarn and sell it as a standard set are very popular, and the sales situation of existing yarn is weaker than yesterday.</p>
<p>The Human Standard Transferred to a Decrease of Two More The human standard market opened in the morning and the market atmosphere was weak. The buying atmosphere in the market was more relaxed because the retail investors' appetites were full, the news of existing yarn was more stable, and the selling atmosphere was sufficient. Each fell by 8.9 cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that the Sanpin yarn had fallen by three or four yuan. The market atmosphere in the market was even more relaxed. Each month fell by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 cents. The total transaction statistics for the day were 29,950 packages. It was found that Xincheng bought 6,250 packages, Yuda bought 2,300 packages, Yiyu bought 1,300 packages, Yichang bought 800 packages, and other 350 to 400 packages. Lichang sold 1,750 packages, Maoji sold 1,200 packages, Yiyu sold 1,900 packages, Hengyi sold 650 packages, Guangfeng sold 750 packages, Senkang sold 800 packages, and the remaining 550 to 600 packages. The closing prices of the human standard are recorded below.</p>
<p>The number of existing accounts for the human standard price increase or decrease is 1530, down 1515000 in September, 1527 down 239800 in December, 1529, 113500 in October, 5571234050 in January, 15291044750 in November, and 1528220150 in February. The existing sales continue to be smooth. The existing yarn sales are smooth. It was found that the total statistics for the current and futures purchases by various gangs throughout the day were 3,583 packages.

<h3>The Cotton Market Is Very Weak</h3>
<p>The cotton market is very weak because the US cotton has gradually found new low prices, which has caused discouragement. Ningbo gangs have closed out many long positions, but the mainland gangs have not released their goods because the land prices are high and the goods are pulled in. The market conditions are still firm, but the overall situation is still pessimistic. Moreover, Japanese factories have purchased more than 10,000 pieces of Indian cotton. The cotton trade in November and December is completely encroached upon by Japanese merchants. Japanese merchants must look at 30 taels, but it is difficult to see at present because the prices received from various sources are firm. In the future, new goods will be listed and crowded, and no one will be interested. At that time, cracks may be found.</p>
<p>The Han Standard Fell Three or Four Cents The Han Standard market opened in the morning because most people expected the US flower to rise, but the US cotton fell again, so the selling atmosphere in the market was very strong. Each month fell by 2-3 cents. In the afternoon, the market for Cambodian cotton was not good and it fell by another five cents. The total transaction statistics for the day were 35,700 dan. It was found that Hengde bought 2,500 dan, Yiyu bought 1,800 dan, Xincheng bought 1,500 dan, Yuanda bought 1,700 dan, Yikang bought 1,800 dan, Maoji bought 2,000 dan, and others 1,000 to 800 dan. Yichang sold 5,300 dan, Hengyi sold 2,300 dan, Gongtai sold 1,800 dan, Maoji sold 1,700 dan, and others 700 to 1,000 dan. The closing prices of the Han Standard are listed on the left. The existing accounts for the Han Standard closing increase or decrease are 3225, down 3599000 in December, 3210, down 382800 in October, 3240, 35103100 in January, 32204109100 in November, and 3250364900 in February. The existing transactions are still rare. The existing cotton business is still clear, but the Japanese factories' intake of Indian cotton is still strong because the prices are cheap. The source is estimated to be 4,000 packages of Yaohua. The Kondi Factory's cost in Japanese yen is 24 yuan, and the Rihua Factory entered 300 pieces in the February shipment. The Wengmura Factory's cost in Japanese yen is 24 yuan, and the Dakang Factory entered 300 pieces. Furthermore, the current product is 33.75, and the Puyi Factory entered 100 pieces. The spot price of Yaohua is 32.00 to 14. In the customer gang, 600 packages were entered. Furthermore, the stack traded [P American cotton with Sanpin, and it flowed downstream again&gt;]</p>
<p>American Cotton Repeatedly Showed New Low Prices Yesterday, American cotton was extremely soft due to large-scale sales and weakness on Wall Street. Later, it slightly recovered due to purchases by the same industry. It is estimated that futures fell by 3 to 13 pound tones, spot goods fell by 10 pound tones, British cotton futures fell by 12 points, spot goods rose by 1 point, Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by 5 points, and Indian cotton market conditions were firm. Japanese merchants and Indian exporters purchased in large quantities. It is estimated that Pingguoer remained unchanged, and Aomla and Bairo Creek rose by three rupees. The original telegraph is recorded on the left (telegraph on the 22nd).</p>

<h3>Inferring the Harvest of American Cotton from Insect Pests</h3>
<p>14 Million Packages Seems to be a Low Number</p>
<p>The abundance of the American cotton harvest depends on the changes in the weather, but the severity of insect pests is also closely related. If the insect pests are severe, the harvest will be poor, and if they are light, the harvest will be abundant. Sometimes the insect pests are more severe, but the weather can remedy the situation and there is no major impact. Therefore, the weather and insect pests are the main elements of the cotton harvest. According to the government cotton production reports and insect pest percentage rates for the past 20 years, the insect pests were the lightest in 1920, at 1.3%, and the yield was 207.7 pounds. The insect pests were the most severe in 1921, at 31.2%, and the yield was only 124.5 pounds. Therefore, the damage from insect pests and the suitability of the weather are both of concern to the general public. The weather in the current season (1930-1931) is dry, but according to reports from all parties, the cotton-growing areas have no major impact and there is no news of insect pests. According to the government gazette on September 8, the insect pests this year are only 4.1% due to the relatively dry climate, which is the same as in 1925. In 1925, the weather also changed and the harvest was 167.2 pounds, exceeding the average yield of the past 10 years by almost 10 pounds. It is found that this year's cotton fields are 4,581,500 acres, a decrease of 2.7% compared to the previous season. This number also includes abandoned field acres. According to the government report on the 8th, the abandoned field rate this season is 2.2%, which is less than in previous years. The actual number of received numbers is 4,479,100 acres. A yield of 167.2 pounds seems impossible this season. If the average number of 158 pounds in the past 10 years is used, the estimated output is about 14,154,000 packages. If the average yield per acre of 160 pounds in the past two years (162.1 in 1929 and 159.6 in 1928) is used, the estimate is about 14,333,000 packages. This number is very close to the three government estimates. If there are no drastic changes in the weather after this, this number will be relatively accurate, and 158 pounds can be considered a low number. Although the production amount of 14 million packages is not abundant, at the current time when the cotton industry is trending toward failure, there is a risk of oversupply. The cotton market is hovering at a low peak and is not easy to tend to be smooth, so it is necessary to figure out how to eliminate this large amount of production in order to stabilize the cotton market. Artificially strong fixed market prices do not seem to be a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>The Weather Was Clear and the Rice Market Indeed Fell Sharply</p>
<p>Yesterday, the source from the river below Zhabei was very strong. Various gangs saw that more than 40 shops were selling very vigorously. The shortage of broken japonica rice remained parallel, and the standard market price was 20 yuan and 34 cents. However, the price of especially top-grade goods was still shouted at 1 yuan yesterday. This goods has already been ordered to be reduced, so there is no criterion to be followed. The arrival of west new japonica rice is gradually surging, and the weather is clear, so people's hearts are very soft and the market sales are dull. Prices fell again by six or seven cents, with high-quality goods opening at 19 yuan, and medium-grade and low-grade goods actually returning to 17 yuan, which is a huge drop of 1 yuan and 4 cents and a half compared to the previous trading day. Such a decline can be called a new record after the release of new rice. The east new japonica rice goods are indeed desolate, and the overall market is 5-6 cents short, opening at 17 yuan and a half. However, the especially top-grade goods are still opening at 18 yuan. The new American tip is only 13 yuan and 7 cents at the highest, and the rest of the ordinary is only about 13 yuan. The price is about half a yuan short. Duzi Xian has returned to 14 yuan and a half, and the trend is soft and weak. The port tip has fallen sharply, with a price as high as 12 yuan and 8 or 9 cents, and the new tip is 12 yuan and a half, and both are 2-3 cents to 4-5 cents short. Overall, the situation of japonica and indica rice in the market has shown a slump. In short, it is difficult for the rice market to stand firm after the weather clears. The arrival of Bai Yuan has already been picked up, and the sales are extremely sluggish. The market surface has plummeted by 4 cents, and the opening price of 18 yuan and 2 triangles has turned sharply downward. Therefore, the situation of rice in all grades throughout the day, except for broken japonica rice, can be described as falling.</p>
<p>About 20 stores arrived from the river in Shanghai South, and the sales in the local street were busy in the morning and sluggish in the afternoon. The market condition of white japonica rice was increasingly lonely. The market price was on the left side of the 19 yuan mark. The new japonica rice was gradually thickening, and the atmosphere of beans was light and weak. The price also fell by half a yuan. The outer top goods opened at 17 yuan, and the fragrant japonica rice opened at 17 yuan and a half. The withered and weak situation was rare. The thin rice was holding up due to the depletion of goods, and the market surface was still at 21 yuan. However, the price could not be used as a standard. Not much new early rice arrived in Shanghai from Nanlu, and the price opened at 18 yuan with zero, while the half tip and Dujian had a slight rebound, but the transaction was still light. The high and low prices also fluctuated differently, and both had to be about 6 cents short outside. Bian Yuan arrived in slightly, and the market fell by 3 cents.</p>
<h3>Hunan Shi Rice Fell by Slightly Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangxi rice continued to arrive for more than 4,000 bags, and sales remained sluggish and the market was still soft. However, after the sudden drop of half a yuan the previous day, the owners were unwilling to sell at a loss, and the arrival of Duxian was slightly less, so people's hearts were slightly stabilized. Therefore, although there were no smooth sales in the overall market, the market price temporarily stabilized. Hunan rice has not had smooth sales for a long time, and there are 2,000 bags in the market that have not been sold to this day, so the price has become even more crazy and small. Yesterday, 500 bags of Shi rice were sold, and the price was 10 yuan to 9 yuan and 6 jiao and 2 cents, which was bought by the local street, and was more than 2 yuan less than at the beginning of the month.</p>
<h3>The Falling Trend of Standard Powder Is More Fierce</h3>
<p>Although it was reported by Tianjin Electric that the falling trend had stabilized yesterday, the incoming telegram of foreign wheat reported a slight drop again. Because the Shanghai-Tianjin powder price was not clear, the customer gang had drawn 50,000 bags of standard powder and the factory was trying to transport 30,000 bags to Beilian, but unexpectedly received a telegram from the Tianjin market that the powder would be temporarily installed slowly, which led to a very light intention of each customer gang to enter. At the same time, the new and old air force unanimously competed to sell, and the price fell step by step. The downstream did not reach the close in the afternoon, and the result was 2-3 cents smaller than the previous day, and the market condition was abnormally depressed. It is feared that it will not be able to reach 2 taels and more in the near future.</p>
<h3>期麥續跌三四分</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the morning wheat futures opened weak, and various parties immediately sold. Due to the lack of buyers, trading was sparse. In the afternoon opening, it was heard that the wheat mills were waiting and watching. As the monthly settlement was approaching, there was a considerable amount of selling in the near term. Fortunately, the northern wheat arriving in Shanghai, such as Shandong, Niuzhuang, Xuzhou, etc., was expected to be upgraded and the price increased. Therefore, the selling pressure increased, and the price went down again. As a result, near and far futures fell by three to four points.</p>
<p>Sugar Market Cotton Yarn Opens Quite Buoyant</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received news from the producing areas. Cuban raw sugar prices were still at 1.15625. New York sugar futures for September were at 1.07, down five points from the previous report. December was at 1.14, March of next year at 1.25, and May at 1.33, each down three points. Java raw sugar price was at 8.625, and sugar futures for October were at 8.25 and November at 8.125, showing no increase or decrease. In the guild market, Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse white sugar, shipped by the Zhibade vessel, arrived with more than 26,000 bags. It happened to be a time of sluggish sales, and the market suddenly weakened. Ordinary goods were quoted at 7 taels and 9 qian, with few buyers. New goods were traded at 8 taels and 0.75 fen, with slight transactions. The market shape was relatively flat. Finely ground white sugar was at 8 taels and 1 qian, and No. 20 medium white sugar was at 7 taels and 7.5 qian. The market was relatively stable. The Japanese sugar market was also flat and tired. High-grade goods were in short supply, and prices saw a slight increase. N mark was at 8 taels and 1 qian, TM mark at 7 taels and 8 qian, Meiji YT mark at 7 taels and 9 qian, YP mark at 8 taels and 2 qian, Minghua YP mark at 8 taels and 2 qian, YT mark at 7 taels and 9.5 qian, J mark at 8 taels and 2.5 qian. Transactions were scattered. The guild market saw 100 bales of domestic cotton yarn from Mianhu open at a price of 8 taels and 5 qian, and the market was still strong.</p>
<p>Piece Goods and Various Goods Rise Further</p>
<p>The piece goods market is becoming increasingly strong, with a great momentum to rise sharply. This is mainly due to the strong demand from the northern merchants, which is unprecedented. Yesterday, the purchases of straight tribute woolen cloth, fine serge, and other items reached 500 to 600 pieces. Therefore, the market sentiment was consistently high. It is said that the Osaka prices for goods arriving in the following months are soaring, and there is a fear of interruption. Therefore, the rising trend is accelerating.

<p>Five Metals, Eastern White Iron, 7-Foot Length Out of Stock</p>
<p>Since the strike at the Osaka factory, the market supply of 7-foot-long Eastern white iron has been lacking. Recently, the trend in the local market is due to continuous export purchases. Therefore, the supply cannot meet the demand, and there is a concern that the existing stock will be exhausted. The current price can be sold for 1 tael and 1 qian and 5 fen per sheet. It is heard that the Eastern factory has sent a telegram stating that the 7-foot-long stock will not be available until the end of October.</p>

<h3>All Circles, Chinese and Foreign, Mourn President Tan</h3>
<p>Half-Mast Flags in Mourning</p>
<p>Following the death of Tan Yankai, President of the Executive Yuan and Acting Chairman of the National Government, the Chinese and foreign communities were deeply saddened. Government agencies such as the Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Government and its subordinate bureaus, the Jianghai Customs, the Postal General Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and other groups all lowered their flags to half-mast for three days as a sign of mourning. The following is a compilation of news heard yesterday:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Kuomintang of China issued Announcement No. 24, stating: "Regarding the announcement of matters, we have received a telegram from the Central Executive Committee stating that Mr. Tan Zu'an, a standing member of this committee, passed away at his residence in Beijing at 9:55 a.m. on September 22nd. All levels of party headquarters are to immediately lower their flags to half-mast for three days to express mourning. This is specially telegraphed for your information, etc." Based on this, this committee has decided that from September 24th, all levels of party headquarters and mass organizations in this city will lower their flags to half-mast for three days to express mourning. In addition to separate orders, this announcement is specially issued.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued an announcement stating: "Regarding the announcement of matters, Mr. Tan, member of the National Government and President of the Executive Yuan, passed away due to illness at 9 a.m. on the 22nd of this month. An order has been received that all agencies inside and outside the capital will lower their flags to half-mast for three days from today, and all entertainment and banquets will be suspended to express mourning, etc." Therefore, a special announcement is published in the newspaper, urging all guilds and company firms, and all merchants, to comply with this order. This announcement also telegraphed condolences to Tan's son, stating: "Tan Mansion, Chengxian Street, Nanjing, Mr. Bo Yu: We were shocked to hear of President Tan's passing. The merchants and people of the entire city deeply mourn his loss. We respectfully express our condolences on behalf of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<p>The Seamen's General Union sent a telegram of condolence to President Tan, stating: "Tan Mansion, Chengxian Street, Nanjing, Mr. Bo Yu and Mr. Ji Fu: We are both saddened by the passing of Mr. Zu Gong. We respectfully send our condolences and wish you well. Zhao Zhizhi, Director of the Seamen's General Union, and all colleagues."</p>
<p>The Diplomatic Corps: Following the passing of Tan Yankai, President of the Executive Yuan and Acting Chairman of the National Government, the External Affairs Office was ordered to notify the ministers and acting representatives of the nine countries in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Japanese acting representative, Shigemitsu Mamoru, the Turkish Minister, Fu Tepei, and the Czech acting deputy representative, Si Tianfen, and others replied by letter, expressing their deep condolences. Turkish Minister Fu Tepei also personally visited Chen Shiguang at the office at 11 a.m. yesterday to convey his condolences.</p>
<p>Coffin Transported to Beijing: Due to the lack of suitable timber in the capital, Tan's family telegraphed Nie Lusheng of the Shanghai Hengfeng Yarn Factory to purchase a high-quality nanmu coffin. The Executive Yuan also sent Counselor Tang Kai to Shanghai to assist in the matter. The coffin has already been selected, and it is said to cost about 3,000 taels. It was specially loaded onto the Beijing-Shanghai express train at 10:15 yesterday afternoon for transport to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Japanese Rice Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The First Page in the History of Grain Transportation</p>
<p>Rice, Jiangxi white rice, has recently continued to arrive. Yesterday, another 3,700 bags arrived and are being unloaded. Also, one matter is quite worthy of reporting: Japanese rice has suddenly been shipped to Shanghai. The first batch is not large, only several hundred bags. Yesterday, eighty-one bags were transferred to Hankou. It is said to be the first time that Dongyang (Eastern Ocean, i.e. Japanese) rice has arrived in China and entered the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Wheat Flour: Since the lifting of the ban on transporting wheat flour to Tianjin, many shipments have recently been loaded and sent to Longkou and Yantai. Tens of thousands of bags have already been transported. In the past month, the amount of Shanghai flour shipped to Yingkou in the Northeast has been enormous. It is estimated that the Huashang Zhaoxing Company's Yingkou route has shipped a total of 552,000 bags of wheat flour in thirteen trips. Currently, there are still large batches of wheat flour waiting to be shipped to Niuzhuang and other ports.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the 18th Standing Committee Meeting of the Grain Committee</h3>
<p>Requesting Fundraising for Grain Storage Fund</p>
<p>The 18th Standing Committee meeting of the Municipal Grain Committee was held at the Social Affairs Bureau. Huang Kutong, Zhu Xinong, and members from various bureaus and the grain industry attended. Chairman Feng Liutang gave a report and opened the meeting. (1) Committee Member Feng proposed that it was reported that the Central People's Food Committee had decided to hold a Food Week in October led by the Party Headquarters in Beijing, provinces, cities, and counties. Should the committee make preparations in advance? It was resolved to contact the Municipal Propaganda Department for further decision. (2) The Social Affairs Bureau submitted a letter from the Municipal Party Headquarters requesting investigation of the free rise and fall of rice prices in rice shops and the setting of standards for rice. It was resolved that the rice shops should be allowed to freely raise and lower prices, and the Social Affairs Bureau should crack down on the rice standards. The case should be forwarded to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines for setting standards. (3) Committee Member Feng proposed that the abundant harvest of rice and grain in various places this year was a good opportunity to prepare for grain storage, and the proposer explained that farmers' livelihoods were difficult due to years of poor harvests. This year's abundant harvest could provide some compensation, but farmers, after being in distress for a long time, would find it difficult to store grain for long. If they rushed to sell, the price of rice would inevitably fall sharply, which would be in line with the saying that cheap grain hurts farmers. Moreover, selling rice would be unprofitable while everything else would be expensive, which would not compensate for the losses and would affect next year's sowing, turning the fields into a cause for future grain shortages. Therefore, it was advocated to raise a grain storage fund of one million yuan and list the fundraising methods. It was resolved that (1) the transfer of grain storage funds and assets from municipal and county levels should be expedited for receiving, consolidation, and reorganization, (2) a grain storage fund raising committee of one million yuan should be raised, and the municipal government should invite local organizations to handle it, and (3) the planning of annual expenses should be handed over to Zhu Zixiang and Yan Xiaoquan to convene a meeting of grain industry members to review and submit a report at the next Standing Committee meeting. In addition, Committee Member Cai Yukun proposed a temporary motion that the ban on rice exports from Zhejiang Province had led to low rice prices, which was harmful to the farmers' economy. It was resolved that free circulation should be allowed in various places, but the smuggling of exports should be strictly prohibited.</p>
<h3>Preventing the Remnants of Pests in Rice Fields</h3>
<p>Joint Proclamation by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Since rice pests such as rice stem borers and black stink bugs were discovered in the farmland of the Wusong, Jiangwan, and Yinhang districts, the Social Affairs Bureau has dispatched personnel to various districts to publicize methods for eliminating stem borers and to set up collection points for stem borer eggs. Most farmers have been able to earnestly capture them, so they were soon eliminated. However, there are still remnants of pests that have entered the rice stems and are hibernating for the winter. Now is the harvest season, and if preventive measures are not taken to cut the rice stems low and destroy the rice roots, they will grow secretly and cause greater harm in the future. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau has formulated four measures. In addition to the Public Security Bureau ordering the various districts to inspect at any time, the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Security Bureau jointly issued a proclamation to all farmers in the Wusong, Jiangwan, Yinhang, and other districts to comply with. The four measures are recorded below: (1) When harvesting rice stems, they must be cut at the root. (2) When sowing wheat and winter crops, the rice roots should be dug up at any time, piled up, and burned. (3) Those who leave rice roots scattered on the wheat fields without burning them will be fined up to three yuan. (4) Those who cut rice stems and leave them exposed on the fields without digging them up, piling them up, and burning them will be fined up to ten yuan.</p>
<h3>Ministry's Reply to the Case of Establishing a Consulate in Taiwan to Protect Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Establishment can Proceed Once Preparations are Complete</p>
<p>The Chen Renshan Case is Still Under Negotiation</p>
<p>In March of this year, Chen Renshan and two other representatives of the petition group to reclaim the overseas Chinese education in Taiwan came to the Shanghai Chinese Overseas Affairs Association to request assistance in petitioning the party and government agencies in Beijing to reclaim the overseas Chinese education rights in Taiwan as soon as possible to avoid being subjected to Japanese cultural aggression. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs handled the matter and planned to establish a consulate in Taiwan to negotiate in the vicinity. In May, Chen Renshan, a representative of the petition, returned to Taiwan with his family and was expelled by the Japanese authorities in Taiwan on the grounds of inappropriate ideas. The Overseas Affairs Association reported the situation to the Nanjing Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee and the Ministry of Education, which forwarded it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for substantive negotiations on the establishment of a consulate in Taiwan and the permission for Chen Renshan to return to Taiwan freely. The matter was delayed for several months without any results. On the 19th of last month, the association received a letter from representatives of the reclamation of overseas Chinese education rights in Mata Anpu, Taiwan, urging for information on the progress of the negotiations. The association submitted a report to the Ministry of Education and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee on the 9th and 18th of this month, which had been forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for processing. Yesterday, the association received a reply No. 478 from the Ministry of Education, stating that the association had previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to expedite the establishment of a consulate in Taiwan and to seek a reply on the negotiations on the Chen Renshan expulsion case. The ministry had copied the original report and sent it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for verification and reply, and the association was notified of the results. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied that Chen Renshan's expulsion case had been reported to the Minister to Japan, who replied that Chen Renshan had not acted improperly and was not a person with inappropriate ideas. He requested that the Taiwan authorities be notified to cancel his deportation order. The Taiwan Governor agreed to inquire and reply after clarification. A further report will be made after the reply. As for the establishment of a consulate in Taiwan, it can be established as soon as preparations are complete. The ministry has been informed accordingly. The association has informed Mata An, representatives of the reclamation of overseas Chinese education rights in Taiwan, and Mr. Chen Renshan of the matter.</p>
<h3>Record of Contemporary Figures' Movements</h3>
<p>Mellor, Inspector General of Customs, traveled north on the Hai Xin patrol ship on the 1st of this month to Dalian to investigate customs affairs and inspect the ports of Huludao and Weihaiwei, where he was preparing to establish customs offices. Mellor arrived at Weihaiwei on his return trip because his wife was staying there for a while. It is now known that he returned to Shanghai on the Hai Xin patrol ship last Saturday (20th) and reported to the office as usual the day before yesterday (Monday). As a result of Mellor's trip, it was decided that the Huludao port was just beginning to be built and the commerce was not yet developed, so a branch office would be established there by the Niuzhuang Customs. The specific plan for establishing a customs office in Weihaiwei has not yet been decided. Yesterday's newspaper reported that the former Tianjin Customs Commissioner, Behler, was awaiting orders to replace Simpson as the Tianjin Customs Commissioner. According to news from the Inspectorate General of Customs, the Tianjin Chang Customs was officially taken over by the former Customs Commissioner Peer on the 21st of this month. As for the Tianjin Customs, the former Customs Commissioner Behler led all customs officers, more than 100 people, to wait for orders there and telegraphed the Inspectorate General of Customs that any difficulties could be dealt with at any time without waiting for further orders. However, when the New Voice News reporter visited the Inspectorate General of Customs at 3 p.m. yesterday, there was no report of the takeover.</p>
<p>Li Zhonggong, the newly appointed Commissioner of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, went to Beijing to discuss the reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's affairs. Yesterday, he returned to Shanghai from Beijing.

<h3>General Secretary of the Pacific Council, Loomis, Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>To Discuss Next Year's Conference in China</p>
<p>Loomis, the acting general secretary of the Pacific Council, arrived in Shanghai on the 22nd from Japan to discuss with the China Committee of the Council the holding of the fourth conference in China next autumn. The Council holds a conference every two years. The first two conferences were held in Honolulu, and the third conference was held in Kyoto, Japan, last year. At the fourth conference next year, the Pacific Council decided to convene the conference in China. Mr. Loomis brought a preliminary outline of the agenda, which divides the special issues into the following seven categories according to their nature: (1) Food, Population, and Land Use; (2) Immigration and Ethnic Issues; (3) International Economic Relations of the Pacific Rim Countries; (4) International Relations of China; (5) Protected Nations and Protected Peoples of the Pacific Rim; (6) Diplomatic Relations on the Pacific Ocean; (7) Cultural Relations of the Pacific Rim Countries. In addition, the current state of the issues considered in the round table meetings of the previous three conferences and the research and discussions of the Council's international discussion plan will also be included one by one.

<p>The Sound of Rising Water Prices</p>
<h3>Two Groups Prepare to Audit Accounts</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of opposing the price increase of public concession tap water, the focus has recently shifted to inspecting the tap water company's accounts. It is also reported that the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation is vehemently opposed, maintaining an absolutely resistant attitude regardless of the audit results. The following is a record of yesterday's news from the Taxpayers' and Property Owners' Associations regarding the audit:</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Appoints Auditors</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association held its fifth executive committee meeting at the Bank Club yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Those present included Chu Huiseng, Li Bohan, Xu Jiyun, Yuan Jinchu, Shen Tianxin, Hu Fengxiang, Cheng Xiechun, Yan E'sheng, Hu Xisheng, Yu Xiji, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Yichen, Fang Jiaobo, Zhu Yinjiang, Xie Zhongfu, and Shi Zikun.

<p>The Shanghai Property Owners' Association sent a letter to the water company yesterday, stating: "In response to your letter of September 18th, requesting the appointment of representatives to audit accounts, we believe that it is admirable for a publicly owned and operated monopoly organization to allow interested parties to examine its accounts. Our association should fulfill this responsibility and cannot refuse. We now request that your company first send us a full set of annual business reports from the start of operations to the present for preliminary study. We will then appoint representatives to come and audit the accounts. A reply to this letter is requested for your reference and action."</p>
<h3>Silk Factories Request Inspection Bureau</h3>
<h3>Cessation of Public Weight Inspection</h3>
<p>Inspections to Cease by the End of September</p>
<p>Silk factories have been suffering losses due to the trial implementation of public weight inspection for raw silk. Recently, the industry association resolved in a general meeting that the Shanghai Silk Factories Association Committee should send a letter to the Commodity Inspection Bureau, requesting the cessation of public weight inspection upon the expiration of the trial period, as reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the association, in addition to requesting assistance from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, has formally sent a letter to the Commodity Inspection Bureau for reference and action. The letter states: "In response to your letter Silk No. 19 of the 8th of this month, regarding the request for relief from losses suffered by silk factories due to public weight inspection, we have received a reply from the Raw Silk Inspection Office regarding the review and discussion. We promptly informed all silk factories. Subsequently, 62 silk factories successively sent letters stating that they have suffered huge losses and cannot endure the burden any longer, requesting that a general meeting of the industry be convened in accordance with the law to promptly seek relief. A general meeting of industry representatives was convened on the 18th of this month, and all present stated that from the beginning of the establishment of the Raw Silk Inspection Office, it suddenly implemented public weight inspection. At that time, all factories expressed that this was practically impossible. However, the Inspection Office repeatedly stated that in order to ensure fair valuation for both buyers and sellers, it might as well implement a six-month trial. After the implementation of public weight inspection, foreign genuine buyers still gave prices according to net weight and did not recognize public weight. The losses suffered by silk factories during this six-month trial period were substantial. Since the buyers did not consider public weight to be valid, it is evident that they did not perceive any moisture loss in Chinese silk. Otherwise, why wouldn't foreign merchants take advantage of the Chinese government's vigorous implementation of public weight inspection to express their support? This further proves that Chinese silk is different from Japanese silk. Japanese silk is suitable for public weight inspection, while Chinese silk is not. Each factory's losses and downgrading suffered during each silk delivery, calculated based on the annual output, range from over ten thousand to at least a thousand dollars. Hidden losses such as installation, futures advances, interest, and other losses are even more difficult to bear. Most heartbreakingly, foreign merchants use the pretext of delays in the public weight inspection procedures of the Inspection Office to arbitrarily suppress prices, resulting in contract terminations and silk returns from time to time. Ultimately, is this public weight method essential for improving product quality and developing foreign trade? Today, the silk market is declining, and factories are facing internal and external troubles, and are on the verge of bankruptcy. Those who are sacrificing and enduring pain to maintain operations are simply trying to extend the thread of hope for Chinese silk. Now, in addition to the high cost of cocoons, huge expenses, and low silk prices, this additional burden of public weight inspection losses has been added. The government's intention in developing national products is certainly not to intentionally cause difficulties for manufacturers, but why should manufacturers throw their limited funds into a bottomless pit and risk unexpected losses? Currently, our industry has no hesitation in advocating and requesting that the Director of the Commodity Inspection Bureau be informed of the situation and immediately order the Raw Silk Inspection Office to cease public weight inspection at the end of this month. Otherwise, in addition to selling off the delivered silk, we will suspend operations to avoid being sacrificed. The public sentiment is indignant, and a unanimous resolution has been reached. As for public weight inspection in silk-producing countries, only Japan implements it. This is because Japanese silk is reeled using new-style silk reeling machines and the submerging method, and then undergoes a re-reeling process (commonly known as 'Yangfan'). The cocoons are thoroughly cooked by the cocoon cooking machine and reeled with warm water. Not only is water immersion used for drying, but water is also splashed onto the silk for re-reeling, so the moisture content is heavier. Exporters stationed in Japan proposed public weight inspection to seek fairness because Japanese silk contains too much moisture. The Japanese government knew that if the moisture content of Japanese silk was not corrected, it would not be able to stand in the American market, so it had to agree to the public weight system to maintain its original international trade position with the United States. For more than 60 years, European and American buyers have never complained about the moisture content of Chinese silk, and there have been no disputes. Now, the manufacturers are firmly requesting, and the sentiments are indignant, which cannot be alleviated by empty words. Therefore, we hereby submit this case for your consideration, hoping that the Director will consider the difficulties of the industry and promptly order the Raw Silk Inspection Office to cease the public weight method from November 1st after the trial period expires, in order to comply with public opinion and eliminate hidden dangers. We are extremely grateful."</p>
<h3>Housing Rental Regulations</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Should Strictly Enforce Them</p>
<p>Recently, housing rent disputes have been increasing in this port. Yesterday, the Third Section, Thirtieth Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department specially submitted a document to the Third District Party Department, requesting that it forward it to the Municipal Government for strict enforcement of the Municipal Housing Rental Regulations promulgated in 1928 to resolve the disputes. The document states (omitted): "The increase in land prices is due to the creative power of society, while the increase in rents is sufficient to affect local security. The Premier has elaborated on this in his Doctrine of People's Livelihood. Shanghai is a bustling hub of Chinese and foreign commerce. In the past, houses on Nanjing Road that cost 20 yuan per building (see the Property Owners' Association's letter to the Taxpayers' Association opposing the tap water price increase) have now increased to more than thousands of taels due to supply and demand. However, the unearned landlords rely on the creative power of society to extract income and enjoy the happiness of mankind, but they are still not satisfied. They frequently demand small rents of thousands, and rent increases and renovations are happening every day. As a result, tenants in Fu Li and Fu Xing Lanes are appealing, and tenants in Qingyun Lane, where White Russians forcibly demolished houses, are seeking help. Newspaper reports are even more overwhelming. If we can make detailed statistics, we firmly believe that no dispute in Shanghai exceeds the housing problem. It endangers the safety of citizens' residences, hinders the prosperity of commerce, and greatly violates the principle of People's Livelihood. However, the authorities responsible for municipal affairs turn a blind eye, which is truly puzzling. We have heard that the Municipal Government and the former Provisional Court of the Concession had issued announcements in 1927 to restrict rent increases and crack down on small rents, but now it is getting worse and worse. We have never heard of any intervention in accordance with those announcements. In 1928, the Municipal Government promulgated the Housing Rental Regulations, but apart from the Public Security Bureau issuing a one-cent rent book, no enforcement has been carried out against landlords who violate the regulations. This year, there is even an organization called the Housing Rent Dispute Arbitration Committee, but we have not heard of it making any appropriate or fair decisions. If these types of disputes mostly fall within the scope of the concession, enforcement may be difficult before the recovery of municipal rights, but that is not entirely the case. The Labor Dispute Handling Law and the Labor Arbitration Committee do not differentiate based on the boundaries of the Chinese Concession, so the two matters are the same. It should not be ignored due to the concession. This matter has been resolved by the Fifth Party Congress of the Branch Department, and we hereby submit this document, hoping that you will review it and forward it to the Municipal Executive Committee to transfer it to the Municipal Government for strict enforcement of the previously promulgated Municipal Housing Rental Regulations to stabilize the local area and benefit the people (omitted)."</p>

<h3>Collection of Special Tax on Cotton Along the Way</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sent a Letter Requesting Strict Prohibition</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the Jiangsu Finance Special Commissioner's Office Yesterday, Requesting Strict Prohibition of the Collection of Special Tax on Cotton Along the Way by the Jiangwan Cotton Special Tax Collection Office. The Telegram States: "Jiangsu Finance Special Commissioner's Office, In Reference to the Case of September 22, the Jiangwan Town Merchants Zhou Sheng Da De Da Yuan Jun Sheng Jinzhang and Other Jingguang Yanghuo Shops Sent a Letter Stating That Recently, the Jiangsu Province Cotton Special Tax Jiangwan Collection Office Has Sent Personnel to Collect Taxes on All Kinds of Cotton Goods at the Passes, Causing Great Disturbance. Jiangwan Is Adjacent to Zhabei and Is Located Within the Shanghai Municipal Area. Currently, the City Areas of Nanshi and Zhabei Are Not Collecting Special Taxes on These Goods, But Only This Town Is Setting Up an Office to Collect Taxes. Is This a Fair Matter? Furthermore, a Tax Bureau Belonging to Jiangsu Province Is Collecting Taxes Within the City Area, Disrupting the Administrative System and Interfering in Another's Affairs. Therefore, We Specially Request Your Association to Transfer This Request to the Higher Authorities to Order a Withdrawal. According to This Investigation, the Collection Personnel Are Collecting Taxes at the Passes in the Form of Disturbances. If This Is Not Investigated and Prohibited, the Harm Will Be Endless. Moreover, the Cotton Special Tax Is Subordinate to the Provincial Special Tax Bureau, and It Arbitrarily Collects Taxes Within the City Area, Which Does Violate the Tax Administration System. According to the Previous Situation, We Should Telegraph Your Office to Investigate and Immediately Order the Cotton Special Tax Bureau to Transfer and Strictly Prohibit the Borrowing of This Situation to Maintain the Tax Administration and Avoid Deep Merchant Burden. Deeply Pray That the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Will Knock on the Door."</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests to Revise the Tariff Rates and Grades for Brown Sugar</h3>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the Ministry of Finance Yesterday, Requesting to Revise the Tariff Rates and Grades for Brown Sugar. The Original Telegram States: "Ministry of Finance, Nanjing, In Reference to the Letter From the Municipal Sugar Industry Association, We Believe That the Tariff Rates for Goods Should Be Fair, So That the Country's Tax Revenue Will Be Substantial and Merchants Will Avoid the Harm of Skewed Business. The Current Import Sugar Tax Regulations Stipulate That Brown Sugar Below Dutch Standard Color No. 11 and Qing Sugar Pay a Brown Sugar Tax of 5 Fen and 7 Li of Customs Tael per Dan, and White Sugar Above Dutch Standard Color No. 10 and Che Bai Sugar Pay a White Sugar Tax of 8 Fen of Customs Tael per Dan. This Kind of Grading Regulation Is Not Excellent and Only Provides a Way for Customs Inspectors to Open Bags and Cause Unexpected Losses to the Sugar Industry and Cause Endless Disputes. The Country's Tax Revenue Has Not Reached Real Benefits. We Will Briefly State the Situation. According to the Dutch Standard Color, Those Below No. 15 Belong to Brown Sugar. If They Pay White Sugar Tax, It Is Really Inappropriate. Brown Sugar Is Originally Made From the Remaining Sugar浆 When Making White Sugar, and the Raw Materials of White Sugar Have Their Own Advantages and Disadvantages. Therefore, the Brown Sugar Made From Sugar浆 Has Different Shades of Light Yellow, Red, and Black, and the Grade Is Also Determined According to the Color, But They Are All Called Brown Sugar. Because the Colors of Sugar浆 Are Different, They Are Also Different. If the Brown Sugar of No. 10 Has a Higher or Lower Color Among Them, There Will Be Mixed Up. When Customs Inspects Imports, If They See a Light Color, They Will Definitely Imply a Demand for Fees, Then They Will Pay Brown Tax, Otherwise, They Must Pay White Sugar Tax. Or Below No. 10, Although There Are High-Color Brown Sugars Among Them, Because the Number Is Not Large, the Customs Inspector Did Not See Them When Inspecting Imports and Paid Brown Sugar Tax. After the Original派 Is Transferred to Other Ports, the Customs Inspector at That Place Discovers That There Is High-Color Sugar When Inspecting Customs, They Always Pointed out That It Is White Sugar, Why Can It Be Reported as Imported Brown Sugar? They Immediately Add the Name of張冠李戴, and They Must Arbitrarily Demand Fees to Have No Problems, Otherwise, They Will Detain the Goods, Punish Them, and Repeatedly Make It Difficult. Our Industry Has Suffered Losses From This Unequal Tax Rate Grading for a Long Time. We Have Endured the Pain to This Day and It Is Difficult to Endure It Again. Therefore, We Specially Ask Your Association to Grant Relief and Quickly Transfer and恳求 the Ministry of Finance to Request That All Brown Sugar Classes of Dutch Standard Color From No. 15 to No. 8 Be Changed to Brown Sugar Tax, That Is, Taking a Step Back, From No. 12 to No. 8 Must Be Changed to Brown Sugar Tax, So That It Is Fair, Relieves the Pain of Sugar Merchants, Makes Customs Inspectors Have No Excuse to Demand Fees, and Does Not Harm the Country's Tax Revenue. Your Association Is the Leading Group of Our Business Community and Has Always Aimed to Relieve Business Difficulties. Please Allow Us to Forward This Request for Revision, Which Is Really a Public 感," In Reference to This, the Current Import Sugar Tax Regulations and the Grading Method of Dutch Standard Color All Belong to Brown Sugar Tax, and There Is a Number Class Difference. Every Time, the Level of Color Is High and Low, Which Causes the Customs Inspectors to Make It Difficult and Cause Distress. The Shang Qing Wants to Change All Dutch Standard Colors Belonging to Brown Sugar From No. 15 to No. 8 to Be Paid According to Brown Sugar Tax. The Country's Tax Revenue Has Not Been Damaged, the Defects of the Customs Can Be Eliminated, and the Merchants Can Also Avoid One-Sided Suffering. According to the Previous Situation, We Will Send a Special Telegram恳求 You to Review and Order the Customs to Comply With This, Which Is Really a Public Convenience."</p>
<h3>Mineral White Powder Mixed Into Rice in This Port</h3>
<p>Report From the Agricultural Inspection Institute</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan Instructed the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining to Investigate and Prohibit Rice Merchants From Mixing Mineral White Powder Into Rice to Increase Weight in Order to Profit From the People's Livelihood and Health. If This Is True, It Should Be Strictly Prohibited to Value the People's Food. It Is Heard That the Institute Has Sent Personnel to Investigate in Detail and Take Rice Samples for Chemical Inspection. The Results Reported That the White Powder Is a Kind of Calcium Carbonate, and the Mixing Amount Seems to Be Uneven, and the One Whose Chemical Inspection Contains 0.91% Calcium Carbonate, That Is, Every 100 Jin of Rice Is Mixed With About 14 and a Half Liang of Stone Powder. If This Calcium Carbonate Contains Too Much, It May Be Difficult to Dissolve in Water and Harmful to the Stomach. The Institute Also Sent a Letter to Inquire About the Central Health Test Institute, Which Replied That the Case of Mixing White Powder Into Rice Was Entrusted by the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau for Chemical Inspection, and the Result Was Also Calcium Carbonate, Which Was Consistent With Your Institute. If the Calcium Carbonate Content Is Too High, There Are Too Many Impurities in the Rice Quality and Less Nutrition, Which Hinders Digestion. According to the Japanese Health Test Method, the Minimum Ash Content of White Rice Test Is 0.3040, the Maximum Is 1.4560, and the Average Is 0.107. Now, the Calcium Carbonate Alone Contains So Much, and the Total Ash Content Must Be Greatly Increased, Which Is Very Likely to Deviate From the Standard and Shows Signs of Adulteration and Fraud. It Is Now Heard That the Agricultural Inspection Institute Has Reported All of the Above Investigation and Chemical Inspection Reports to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining for Review.</p>

<h3>Problem of Resignation of Elected Officials of Trade Associations</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submitted a Report to the Social Bureau for Instructions</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submitted a Document to the Social Bureau for Instructions on How to Resolve the Resignation of Elected Officials of Trade Associations. The Document States: "Reporting for Instructions on Which Law Should Be Used to Determine the Authority to Approve or Disapprove the Resignation of Elected Officials of Trade Associations. It Is Reported That the Articles of Association of Trade Associations Mostly Stipulate That the Resignation or Retirement of Elected Committee Members Shall Be Determined by the General Meeting of Members. Therefore, the Following Questions Arise: (1) The General Meeting of Members Is Held Once a Year in Accordance With the Articles of Association. Should It Be Allowed to Be Vacant Before It Is Submitted to the General Meeting for Approval? (2) Should a Temporary General Meeting of Members Be Convened Because of the Resignation of a Few Elected Committee Members? If It Is Difficult to Convene or the Number of Attendees Is Insufficient, What Method Should Be Used to Remedy This? (3) Should the Resignation or Retirement Be Approved by More Than Two-Thirds of the Representatives Attending the General Meeting of Members, or Can It Be Modified? Some Trade Associations in This City Have Sent Letters Requesting Explanations on the Above Three Questions. The Cotton Cloth Industry Association Is One of the Associations With Questions. The Department Has Approved the Opinion of the 科 That, in Accordance With the Election Principles and Authority, the Resignation of Elected Personnel, Regardless of Whether It Is Stated in the Articles of Association, Should Be Approved by the General Meeting of Members of the Original Election. However, This Kind of General Meeting Is Often Difficult to Convene. Therefore, According to General Practice, Unless Too Many Resigning Personnel Must Convene the General Meeting of the Original Election to Resolve It According to Law, If Only a Few People Apply for Resignation After Being Elected, They Can Be Allowed to Take Office First by the Majority of Elected Personnel, and Then a Meeting Will Be Convened to Discuss Approval. If the Resolution Is to Approve the Resignation, the Candidates Will Be Notified to Fill the Vacancy and Report It to the主管 Department for Record. Wait for the Second General Meeting of Members to Be Convened in the Future and Submit It for Reaffirmation. Based on the Above Opinions, the 12th Standing Committee Meeting of This Month Decided That, in Addition to Informing the Elected Officials of the Cotton Cloth Industry Association to Take Office First, It Will Also Request a Reply for Instructions So That It Can Be Ordered to Comply. It Should Be Recorded and Listed as a Question, and Formulated an Opinion to Be Submitted to Your Bureau for Review and Approval So That It Can Be Ordered to Comply for Public Convenience."</p>

<h3>Continued Hearing of the Wu Suzhong Case</h3>
<p>Handwriting Comparison in Court</p>
<p>Wu States Five Reasons</p>
<p>Investigation of Fengxian Incident Required</p>
<p>Re-examine Wu's Participation</p>
<p>Wu Suzhong, a former reporter for the Shishi Xinbao (Eastern Times), was secretly investigated by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and found to be an alias of the well-known Communist Hu Yu. A letter was sent to the Special District Court requesting assistance in transferring him for interrogation. Due to objections from the police, repeated interrogations and investigations have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that the defendant was initially detained in the police station, but due to the prolonged delay and overcrowding in the police station's detention facilities, he was transferred to the Tilanqiao Western Prison after the last hearing. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Jiashi specially opened the first courtroom and ordered the defendant to be brought to court for continued trial. Zhan Jifeng, the legal counsel of the Garrison Headquarters, requested that the documents seized from the defendant's residence be handed over for detailed examination. The defendant also requested that the current Criminal Law promulgated by the National Government be given to him for review. After Wu reviewed the Criminal Law, he asked the judge to inquire about the charges against him by the Garrison Headquarters and the applicable legal provisions. Attorney Zhan stated that the defendant's crimes had been detailed in the transfer document, namely the crimes stipulated in the Anti-Revolutionary Punishment Law. The law has a total of thirteen articles, and the defendant is accused of violating the first to seventh articles. The specific article to be used for sentencing will be determined after the transfer to the headquarters for trial. At this time, Attorney Zhan had finished reading the documents issued in court and stated that the defendant had previously confessed that some of the documents had been modified by him, so he requested that the defendant write in court for handwriting comparison. Because the documents were written with a fountain pen, the judge also asked the defendant to write the following words with a fountain pen: "I came to Shanghai because of the banditry in my hometown in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, and it has been three years since then. My cotton-padded jacket is covered with dark clouds and drenched in heavy rain." After a detailed comparison, he asked, "Was this diary found in your home and written by you?" Wu replied, "I only modified the text." The judge then handed the document back to Wu for review. Surprisingly, when he read the third page, he suddenly claimed, "I don't have this document at home. I don't know where it came from." The judge instructed, "This was found in your home, and you previously admitted that you modified parts of it. Now you deny it. Then who wrote it?" Wu confessed, "There are two other pages." The judge immediately summoned the detective Zhang Yi for questioning. According to Zhang, the documents were indeed found in the defendant's residence. The judge further instructed the defendant, "Now it appears that the entire manuscript is in one person's handwriting, and the detective has also confirmed that it was found in your home. What else do you have to say?" Wu claimed that the punctuation in the text was mostly unclear, and as a newspaper reporter, he would never write such text. At this time, Attorney Zhan had finished reading the police report on the investigation of the Sandeli Jinan Society. Judge Xu then announced that according to the police investigation report, No. 5 Sandeli, which is now changed to No. 8, was indeed searched in February of the sixteenth year, and the people arrested at that time were indeed members of the Jinan Society, which was consistent with the testimony of the previous witness, Bao Junfu. The defendant requested to confront Wang Bin, an investigator from the Garrison Headquarters. Wu claimed that when he was taken for investigation that day, the gatekeeper there did not know him. If he really lived at No. 5, then the gatekeeper would definitely have seen him every day. However, on that day, the gatekeeper said that he did not know him, so he did not actually live there. Investigator Wang immediately stated that the gatekeeper could not identify the defendant because several years had passed and there were many people detained. Judge Xu then asked the defendant's representative lawyer, Wang Shaochang, where the statements in his petition came from. Lawyer Wang replied, "This is based on what the defendant's wife said." The judge instructed the defendant, "You previously stated that you only came to Shanghai three years ago, but your petition states that you have lived in Shanghai for more than ten years. This is too contradictory." Lawyer Wang immediately defended, "It was my mistake to write four as ten, which led to this error." The judge asked, "How could four be mistaken for ten when the petition clearly states more than ten years?" The defendant did not answer. At this point, Attorney Zhan presented two pieces of paper, saying, "This is solid evidence in the case. After the defendants were arrested and detained in the sixteenth year, the defendant, under the alias He Jingchun, wrote this note to a fellow prisoner, Mr. Bao, through Chen Mingzhong. Bao kept it as a memento until now and presented it along with a booklet published by the Jinan Society." After the judge handed the note to the defendant for review, the defendant firmly denied it and was ordered to write the sentence "Now we want to find a way to rescue all of you fellow sufferers" to compare the handwriting. Attorney Zhan waited for him to finish writing and carefully reviewed it. Although the defendant deliberately disguised it when writing, he could not hide the similarities. The defendant then requested permission to question Investigator Wang a few words and then stated five reasons to the court: 1. The Anti-Revolutionary Punishment Law was promulgated on March 9 of the seventeenth year, while the Jinan Society case occurred in February of the sixteenth year. The law does not retroactively punish past actions. Even if there were irregularities in February of the sixteenth year, they would not be subject to the law promulgated in the seventeenth year. 2. The results of the police investigation of Sandeli last time showed that he was not suspected of any crime. 3. Bao's testimony is not credible. 4. The Jinan Society was a public organization at the time. 5. If he were a Communist, why wouldn't he use the newspaper to promote Communism since he worked in a media organization? Attorney Zhan then stood up to argue, saying that the defendant cited the principle that the law does not retroactively punish past actions to absolve himself of guilt, but he did not pay attention to the provision in the Anti-Revolutionary Punishment Law that anyone who committed a crime before the law was finalized would still be dealt with according to this law. This case was originally based on a report from an investigator named Xu about the Communist riots in Fengxian, and the defendant was responsible for contacting them for economic support. Therefore, he was transferred to the court for questioning. Because the defendant denied being named Hu Yu, it was necessary to mention the case in the sixteenth year. Now the defendant claims that the events of the sixteenth year are not subject to the Anti-Revolutionary Punishment Law. This is his misunderstanding. My attorney has already stated that the specific article to be used for sentencing will be determined after interrogation. As for the evidence, in addition to the oral testimony of Xu and Bao, there is also written evidence. Although he has changed his tone now, his words reveal his true meaning, etc. Furthermore, the handwriting he wrote today is very different from the past. For all these reasons, he should be handed over to the Garrison Headquarters for removal, etc. The police lawyer Bo Liang then stood up to reply, saying that if the defendant was indeed suspected of a crime, the police would not object, but the secret order submitted by the Garrison Headquarters could not be used as the basis for the transfer, etc. Attorney Zhan replied that the secret order was not the only basis for transferring the defendant. Because the police believed that the military agency had no right to handle the case, this secret order was presented to prove that they had the right to handle the case. Article 2 of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law stipulates that anyone who commits a crime in a martial law area is subject to the jurisdiction of the military agency. The defendant is related to the Communist riots in Fengxian, and the location and time of the riots were both within the martial law area and during the martial law period. According to this, the Garrison Headquarters naturally had the right to request assistance in transferring him for interrogation, but the police lawyer demanded evidence of martial law. Judge Xu then announced that the first issue to be investigated in this case was whether Wu Suzhong was Hu Yu. This point has been sufficiently proven by Bao Junfu's testimony and the police investigation. The statements in the letter presented today can also corroborate Bao's testimony, and the handwriting is also very similar to the defendant's writing. It is even clearer that Wu Suzhong is Hu Yu. However, regarding the part about the Fengxian riots, whether the defendant participated and the start and end dates and areas of martial law still need to be investigated. Therefore, he ordered the defendant to be returned to custody and rescheduled for further interrogation.</p>
<p>Continuation of the Suzhou High Court Trial</p>
<h3>The Case of Burying Guan Maoda Alive</h3>
<p>Hou Genbao Denies Murder</p>
<p>Two Witnesses Claim Ignorance</p>
<p>Prosecutor's Argument</p>
<p>Sentencing on the Afternoon of the 27th</p>
<p>Suzhou Express News: The Suzhou High Court yesterday (23rd) afternoon at 3:00 continued the debate on the case of Hou Genbao of Shanghai burying his cousin Guan Maoda alive, summoning the relevant parties Guan Liukun, Wang Zaofeng (i.e., Wang Zhaofu), who discovered the body next to the field shed, and Li Futian, Hou Genbao's brother-in-law. The trial was conducted by Huang Bingdao, the presiding judge of the Third Criminal Court, and Zhao Zheng, the judge. As a result, the in-court debate concluded and the sentencing was scheduled for the afternoon of the 27th of this month. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Hou Genbao's Testimony: After the court opened, Hou Genbao was questioned first, and his testimony was roughly the same as in the previous court hearing. Next, the plaintiff Guan Liukun testified that his son Maoda's death was undoubtedly caused by Hou Genbao burying him alive. On the afternoon of the 8th, Hou Genbao went to my house and left in a hurry, obviously trying to escape. He went to his brother-in-law Li Futian's house to hide. As for Hou Genbao's statement that "I entrusted him to go to Shanghai to find Maoda," it is inconsistent with the facts. After Maoda went out on the 8th and did not return, I only entrusted Xu Agui to go out to look for him and did not entrust Hou Genbao to go to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Wang Zaofeng's Testimony: Witness Wang Zaofeng testified that he went out to pull a rickshaw at about 3:00 every morning and returned home at 12:00 noon to hand over the shift. He slept until 3:00 in the afternoon, so he did not know about the discovery of Maoda's body. (Question) How many people are in your family? (Answer) Five people, including my wife, etc. (Question) Is your wife at home? (Answer) The adults are all farming in the fields outside. Only the children are at home. (Question) Whose field are you farming? (Answer) We rent and cultivate from someone named Cai. It is not far from where the body was found, but we cannot see it. (Question) Are there any other sheds next to your shed? (Answer) There are none nearby. (Question) Maoda's body was dug out next to the grave. You live so close. Did you know about it? (Answer) I didn't know at first. I only found out later when everyone went to see it. (Question) How tall was the wheat in the field at that time? (Answer) About two feet tall. (Question) Do you have to pass by the grave to get home? (Answer) No, because we take the small path. At this point, Zhu Shuzhen, Hou Genbao's defense lawyer, stood up and said that the court should ask Wang Zaofeng about the events of the 8th. Therefore, Judge Huang continued to ask, "What time did you go out on the 8th?" (Answer) "I went out at 3:00 in the morning, returned home at 12:00 noon to eat, and then went to sleep at 3:00. I went out again in the middle of the night." (Question) "Did you know that Maoda's body was found next to the grave? Did your wife know when she was farming?" (Answer) "My wife didn't know when she was farming."</p>
<p>Li Futian's Testimony: Next, Li Futian testified that Hou Genbao is my brother-in-law, and Maoda is my cousin. On the afternoon of the 9th, Hou Genbao came to my house when I was not at home. Later, Hou Genbao went to look for him. At 4:00, Hou Genbao's brother Kebi told me that Maoda's body was dug out next to the grave, so I went to Guan's house and stayed at Guan's house that night. It was not until the 10th when I returned home that I learned that Hou Genbao stayed at my house that night. In the evening, Hou Genbao came again because he heard that the police station had arrested his mother. He asked me to accompany him to the police station to see his mother. When we arrived at Jiaotong Road, a patrolman recognized him and arrested Hou Genbao. At this point, Judge Zhao asked, "Did you enter the police station?" (Answer) "No, I only went to the gate." (Question) "Did you see the interrogation?" (Answer) "No." (Question) "How far is your house from Guan Liukun's house?" (Answer) "About seven or eight li." (Question) "From Hou Genbao's house?" (Answer) "Only four or five li." At this point, Hou Genbao was asked again, "You confessed in the Fourth District that you conspired to murder Guan Maoda. Why are you retracting your confession today?" (Answer) "Because they forced me to confess under torture." (Question) "Are there any scars? Can they be examined in court?" (Answer) "It has been too long, and the scars are no longer visible."</p>
<p>Prosecutor's Argument: Next, Prosecutor Jin stood up to argue, saying, "The defendant Hou Genbao had previously confessed in the police station that he discussed burying Maoda alive with Guan Caidi. In the two court hearings in this court, he claimed that he was forced to confess under torture in the police station and also said that the scars were no longer visible. Such free words are not sufficient to be adopted. The murder weapons in this case, such as the wooden cone and iron bar, were found in the defendant's house. This is sufficient proof that they were the murder weapons in this case. However, the reasons for Hou Genbao and Caidi killing Maoda, who was only thirteen years old, are unknown. Reviewing the case files, Maoda and Caidi were born to different mothers. Caidi is older and may have coveted the property and committed this heinous crime. Based on this, it is still difficult to prove who initiated the crime. Therefore, the issue of punishment in this case is still subject to deliberation."</p>
<p>Lawyer's Argument: Then, Lawyer Zhu defended, asking to pay attention to five points: (1) The wooden cone and iron shovel were said to be from the maternal uncle's house at the Public Security Bureau, but Guan Liukun did not recognize them as being in his house. Hou Akun has a long-standing feud with the appellant, and the two items were taken out by Akun, so his report is naturally not credible. (2) The village chief and the plaintiff have the same surname. The words "Maoda must have been killed by Hou Genbao" are speculative. (3) Caidi is a female worker in a yarn factory and is known to be promiscuous. The plaintiff and neighbors deny the affair between her and Genbao. Therefore, this case cannot be finalized without Caidi's presence. (4) When Police Chief Yang of the district court investigated, Qian Jianzhou and others said that Genbao killed Maoda, but no one saw it. Moreover, the pit is four feet deep and four feet long, which could not have been dug in a short time. (5) On the 9th, Genbao and Xu Agui went to the Gordon Road and Jing'an Temple police stations to report Maoda's disappearance. Moreover, Genbao was arrested after surrendering himself to the police station to find his mother, and the plaintiff originally had no property. The appellant's claim of seeking wealth is also unfounded. Finally, the judge instructed that the sentencing in this case is scheduled for the afternoon of the 27th, and the court was adjourned.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Continued Hearing of You Yahao's Accusation</p>
<h3>The Zhang Yang Bigamy Case</h3>
<p>Yang Xuejiu Claims Illness and Does Not Appear</p>
<p>Sister and Brother-in-law's Wonderful Conversation</p>
<p>Gong Yu Promises to Return Items</p>
<p>Pastor Yu Still Awaits Summon</p>
<p>After Yang Xuejiu, the principal of the Chengdong Girls' School, married engineer Zhang Nai, Zhang's first wife, You Yahao, accused Zhang of bigamy and also sued Zhang, Yang, Zhang's mother, Yu Zhang, Zhang's sister, Gong Yu, Yang's mother, Yang, etc., for theft of property worth 3,000 yuan. In addition to demanding compensation for the property, she also demanded that Zhang Nai repay the household expenses of more than 2,000 yuan and future living expenses of 30,000 yuan, etc. Zhang has not returned from Japan, but the others have all appeared for questioning. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Cheng opened the court for a continued hearing. Yang Xuejiu claimed illness and did not appear. Pastor Yu, who was ordered to appear last time, also did not appear because of his close relationship with the Yang family. Xu Fuyu, a partner in the Guangyi Photo Studio, was then summoned to testify that the photos of Zhang and Yang's marriage were taken by the studio. Judge Cheng then examined a photo and asked You Yahao if she recognized the people in the photo. You replied that it was a photo of Zhang and Yang together. The person standing next to them was Zhu Tianlin, Zhang's brother-in-law, who could also be called a "sister's substitute" because when Zhang was a teacher at a certain school, his sister wanted to enter the school but was afraid that she was too old, so she reduced her age when registering and became Zhang's sister. Then, Wang Jinzu of Zhigingfang Guan Lane was summoned to testify that Zhang and You lived in No. 19 of the lane for more than a year. In May of this year, Zhang began to move. The miscellaneous items in the house were moved away by Gong Yu and Mr. Gong together. I initially stopped them, but Gong Yu said that she was acting on Zhang Nai's orders and came to move the items, so I could not interfere. Gong Yu testified that because my brother Zhang Nai was out and the residence was unattended, I temporarily moved the items back to my house because I did not know where You was and could not notify her. Now that You wants to take the items back, she must obtain my brother's permission. At this time, the plaintiff requested that the property moved away by the defendant be seized according to the Criminal Law, and Gong Yu immediately stated that if You came to take the items, she could move them away. The representative lawyer of the plaintiff, Chen Tingrui, then stated that since Gong Yu agreed to allow the plaintiff to take the items, the plaintiff's accusation of theft against Gong Yu could not be established and requested that she be declared innocent. After debating with the plaintiff's lawyer, Judge Cheng instructed that Pastor Yu be summoned for a supplementary hearing next Tuesday afternoon, and Zhang Nai and Yang Xuejiu be arrested and brought to court for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Pirates Return</h3>
<p>Defeating Pirates at Da'an Port</p>
<p>Lusi Port Re-Occupied</p>
<p>Water Police Have Been Sent to Suppress Them</p>
<p>Da'an Port and Lusi, etc., which are outside Wusongkou and border the sea, were previously the gathering places for large groups of pirates. The residents on land and merchant ships at sea in the nearby area suffered greatly. A few days ago, the pirates suddenly left Da'an Port and Lusi en masse and went north. It was not clear where they went. Unexpectedly, the pirates suddenly returned to Da'an Port in large numbers the day before yesterday, hoping to land and occupy the area. Fortunately, Lin Lingcha, the captain of the 18th Team of the Fourth District of the Wusong Water Police, led the patrol boat and the Haimen County Police Team to repel the pirate ships. The pirates saw that there was no opportunity to take advantage of and immediately set sail and left. At the same time, Lusi Port was re-occupied by more than 500 pirates. After receiving the alarm, Captain Lin of the 18th Water Police Team has ordered the patrol boats of the three sub-teams under his command to quickly go to suppress them.</p>
<h3>Foreigners Allowed to Hold Boat Races in Qingyang Port</h3>
<p>Chinese Allowed to Join</p>
<p>Approved by the Provincial Government</p>
<p>The Underwriting Board, i.e., the Boat Racing Association, established by foreigners in this port, has traditionally held boat races in Qingyang Port twice a year in the spring and autumn. Last year, the Chinese authorities prohibited the races because Qingyang Port belonged to the interior. The president of the association, Nashu, submitted a request to the Jiangsu Provincial Government on the 9th of this month, requesting permission for the association to hold the autumn races in the same location on November 1 and 2, and to welcome Chinese to participate in the competition to comply with international standards. The request has now been approved by the chairman of the provincial government. Boat racing is highly valued by universities in Europe and the United States. A certain two universities run by Chinese in this port previously wanted to join the association to arouse Chinese interest in boat racing, but they were unexpectedly rejected by the association. Now, the association is allowing Chinese to join in order to obtain a license.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Rejects Vagrant Relief Agency</h3>
<p>No Funds or Foundation</p>
<p>Order to Cancel Preparatory Office</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau recently received a submission from citizen Zhang Shanfu stating that he had initiated the Shanghai Vagrant Relief Agency and attached the articles of association, requesting approval for the record and preparation, etc. The Bureau believed that the agency had no funds or foundation and relied solely on soliciting monthly donations from merchants and the public in the name of beggar donations, which would likely cause trouble for merchants and harass the people and create many malpractices. Furthermore, after reviewing the attached articles of association, the Bureau found that the content was disorganized, the intentions were vague, and it was like child's play. The Bureau rejected the request for the record and ordered the preparatory office to be canceled by the deadline.</p>
<p>The World's Wisdom</p>
<h3>Judgment in the Case of Two Bookstores</h3>
<p>Du Haisheng Fined 30 Yuan</p>
<p>The dispute between the World Bookstore and the Kaiming Bookstore, which shocked the publishing industry, has lasted for a month. The case has now been concluded by the Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon, the plaintiff, the World Bookstore, won the case, and the defendant, the Kaiming Bookstore, was fined. The details are recorded as follows: First, on July 26, the Kaiming Bookstore suddenly entrusted a lawyer to send a letter to the World Bookstore, stating that the Standard English Reader was copied and plagiarized from the English Reader. The World Bookstore sued the author Lin Handa on this basis. Lin denied any plagiarism and presented evidence to refute it in a letter entrusted to a lawyer. After this, the industry did not hear any news about the matter. On August 26, the cover of the major newspapers in this port successively carried large advertisements for the Kaiming Bookstore. The World Bookstore was greatly angered and accused Du Haisheng, the manager of the Kaiming Bookstore, of damaging its reputation and credit in the Special District Court. After the first trial, Judge Cheng Shangfeng ordered a rescheduling for the second hearing. Wang Jinnan, the general manager of the World Bookstore, the plaintiff, Lin Handa, and lawyers Lu Shaozong and Li Xinyang, etc., and the defendant, manager Du Haisheng, Zhang Xichen, and lawyer Wang Zengxian, etc., all appeared in court. The 55-year-old defendant Du Haisheng stood for two hours and seemed to be in great pain, speaking in a very low voice. However, both parties were intellectuals, and their words were very elegant. The lawyers of both parties then debated one after another. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Cheng announced the judgment, the main text of which was that Du Haisheng was fined 30 yuan for the crime of publicly insulting others. The other parts of the lawsuit were dismissed. Zhang Xichen was found not guilty. Du Haisheng was ordered to pay a deposit of 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Russian Man Jumps to His Death in a Frenzy</h3>
<p>Alexandrov, a Russian man who worked as a servant in a certain garden, recently suffered from severe malaria and was admitted to the Gongji Hospital for treatment. At 10:00 PM on the 21st of this month, his condition worsened and he became mentally disturbed. He suddenly left his sickbed and went to the veranda and jumped down. Ai lived upstairs, so he suffered serious injuries after falling downstairs. He was carried into the hospital for treatment, but died at 1:00 AM. The body was sent to the mortuary in a car. Yesterday morning, the Special District Court appointed Prosecutor Guo Huaipu to inspect the mortuary. The wife of the deceased, Sefimmigge, filed a complaint, stating that the Russian man was 34 years old and lived at No. 368 Yuyuan Road. My husband had a disease last year and recovered after treatment. Unexpectedly, the disease relapsed this year and requested to claim the body. Mr. Guo verified the confession and instructed that the deceased Russian man Alexandrov had indeed suffered from a severe illness and jumped to his death in a frenzy, and the body would be coffined and buried by his wife.</p>
<h3>Autopsy of German Suicide</h3>
<p>The Body is Claimed by Keqifev for Coffin Burial</p>
<p>Shi Lehuai, a German man, committed suicide at his residence at No. 1 Suzhou Road due to business failure, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Shi was 45 years old and had been in Shanghai for more than 30 years, engaged in the cotton business. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the General Patrol House received a report and sent a Western detective to his residence. Because the door was locked, they broke the window and entered the room, where they saw Shi lying in a pool of blood with a pistol left behind, loaded with bullets. The body was carried to the mortuary on Fielun Road, and the pistol was taken back to the patrol house. Yesterday morning, the Special District Court was reported and appointed Prosecutor Guo to inspect the mortuary. According to his friend Keqifev, he was hired by the deceased. The deceased had a stomachache and committed suicide due to business failure. The deceased also had a younger brother doing business in America. Prosecutor Guo then instructed Keqifev to sign a statement and claim the body for coffin burial.</p>
<h3>Male Corpse Hanged to Death in an Empty House</h3>
<p>Apparently Committed Suicide Due to Economic Pressure</p>
<p>There is an empty house opposite the Nanyang Middle School on Longhua Road, which has been uninhabited and is called the "ghost house" by everyone. Yesterday morning, someone passing by saw a person hanging from the beams inside, swinging like a swing, and ran in fright to report to the police station. Police found that it was a man who had hanged himself. He was stiff when touched. His face was only twenty years old, and his clothes were a single, old, and tattered garment. It was assumed that he was at the end of his rope and had been killed by economic hardship. The local headman Zhang Liqing was summoned to report to the district court for an autopsy. Prosecutor Li and others were appointed to the scene for an autopsy, and the body was taken to the hall for collection.</p>
<h3>Deng Houcai Suffers Loss of Funds Mid-Journey</h3>
<p>Selling a Child for Travel Expenses Leads to Theft While Asleep</p>
<p>Stumbling Upon Stolen Goods During a Walk Leads to Arrest and Handover to Authorities</p>
<p>Deng Houcai, a 33-year-old man from Jiujiang, and his wife, Zhao, 34, lived a frugal life in their hometown, managing to make ends meet. However, due to rampant banditry in the area, they decided to relocate to Anhui temporarily. Lacking suitable employment and with their travel funds dwindling, they struggled to make a living. Hearing of opportunities in Shanghai but unable to afford the journey, they sold their eight-month-old infant for thirty-six silver dollars. They then boarded the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangjing steamer to Shanghai. Unfortunately, upon reaching Nantong at midnight, Deng and Zhao were fast asleep when several thieves seized the opportunity to steal twenty-four silver dollars, clothing, and a straw hat from their basket. The next morning, Deng realized the theft. Having lost almost all their possessions, they were distraught upon arriving in Shanghai, contemplating throwing themselves into the sea. A fellow passenger, Qi Yulin from Yancheng, noticed their distress and dissuaded them. While strolling on the deck, Qi Yulin noticed four passengers, Dai Jinlin, Cao Changhua, Liu Gouzi, and Wei Changjiang, gambling at pai gow. One of them was wearing the straw hat that had been stolen from Deng. Qi informed Deng, who confronted the group. Dai and his companions, realizing they had been exposed, became agitated and argued with Qi. Xu Rengui, the ship's foreman, heard the commotion and intervened. Finding the situation deplorable, he detained Dai and the others. Upon arriving in Shanghai around 11:00 AM yesterday, they were handed over to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's South Bund inspection office, who in turn transferred them to the police for investigation and punishment, serving as a deterrent to troublemakers.</p>
<h3>Mitsui Sues Hong Cangting Case Resolved</h3>
<p>The lawsuit filed by Mitsui &amp; Co., a Japanese firm, against He Gengxin in the Special District Court for neglecting goods and holding guarantor Hong Cangting jointly liable, has been repeatedly postponed due to corporate entity issues. As previously reported, during the postponement period, Hong Cangting, due to business considerations, wished to avoid prolonged litigation and expressed a willingness to settle. With the enthusiastic support of friends, including fellow tobacco merchants Wu Tinghang, Yu Lanting, Gu Shaoqing, and Hu Sen, as well as lawyers Zhang Yaozeng and Otsuichi Okamoto, and with the local authorities encouraging a compromise due to Hong's perceived innocence, a settlement agreement was reached. It is reported that a settlement contract was signed and the obligations fulfilled the day before yesterday (the 22nd). Consequently, the next court hearing will not include the second defendant.</p>

<h3>A General Overview of Chinese and Western Medicine Approaches to Lung Disease</h3>
<p>Narrated by Mr. Cai Bicheng, Former Imperial Physician of the Qing Dynasty</p>
<p>(1) The Tuberculosis Bacillus in Chinese and Western Medicine</p>
<p>The Compendium of Materia Medica states that tuberculosis, also known as "corpse transmission disease," (i.e., consumption) occurs when someone dies and then infects a family member. It is called "corpse transmission" because it transmits from the deceased to the living. It is also called "transmission," because the disease descends from above, resembling previous cases. Hence, it is called "symptoms." There are variations such as house transmission, clothing transmission, and food transmission. After death, it can even transmit to bystanders, potentially leading to the demise of an entire family.</p>
<p>The "De Xiao Fang" states that the appearance of consumption worms (i.e., tuberculosis bacilli) may resemble scarab beetles, red silkworms, horse tails, toads, hedgehogs, rats, or rotten noodles. Some have feet but no heads, while others have heads but no feet. Their forms are so varied that it is difficult to distinguish them. If transmitted to three people, they may resemble human or ghostly shapes.</p>
<p>The "Zhi Zhi Fang" states that the cause of consumption (i.e., tuberculosis) is often due to damage from alcohol and sex before a person's blood and qi are stable in youth, leading to an accumulation of heat toxins that create foreign bodies and evil worms that corrode the internal organs. Those who care for the sick person are exposed to the evil qi over time and become infected.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Koch, the former director of the German Imperial Health Institute, the shape of the tuberculosis bacillus resembles a rod and it cannot move on its own. It is very small, straight, or curved. Its method of reproduction is through self-division, from one to two, two to four, four to eight, and so on, doubling each time, resulting in an astonishing rate of reproduction. If allowed to reproduce in a suitable environment, one bacillus can transform into millions in a single day. A single lump of phlegm from a tuberculosis patient contains over 300 million tuberculosis bacilli. If the patient expectorates once an hour, they will expel 7.2 billion tuberculosis bacilli from their lungs into the air each day, exposing the world to their invasion. According to Dr. Bergell, a renowned German physician, the tuberculosis bacillus is composed of a neutral fat inner membrane and an acid-resistant wax outer membrane. Unless a way is found to destroy its wax defense and dismantle its fat armor, it is impossible to capture and kill the tuberculosis bacillus. Furthermore, when tuberculosis bacilli invade a local area of the human body, they erode the surrounding tissue to form stubborn nodules that obstruct blood flow. This prevents general disinfectants administered through injection or ingestion from penetrating the affected area. It is like a specially quarantined zone, where medicine cannot reach the affected tissue. Therefore, even if the entire body is submerged in a medicinal solution, it cannot kill a single hair of the tuberculosis bacillus. Thus, the only strategic approach to eradicating tuberculosis must possess at least the following two prerequisites:</p>
<p>(1) Any medicine must be able to break through the nodules and directly reach the affected area.</p>
<p>(2) It must also be able to strip or dissolve the waxy and fatty inner and outer membranes.</p>
<h3>(II) Public Disclosure of Ancient Secret Formulas for Treating Consumption in Traditional Chinese Medicine</h3>
<p>"Dan Xin" says, "Thinness indicates fire; the fire burns the medicine. It is difficult to treat those who have lost all their flesh." "Zhi Zhi Fang" says, "It is impossible to treat consumption when it reaches the point of bone pain, bone atrophy, a deep, hoarse voice, a withered complexion, and a sallow face." "Ru Men Shi Shi" says, "Consumption with choking and loss of voice is fatal. Deficient consumptive conditions with incessant diarrhea are also."</p>
<p>"Zheng Chuan" says, "The method for treating consumption is, first, to kill the worms to eliminate their root, and second, to nourish the deficiency to restore the true essence. If the illness is severe and the original qi has been depleted, even if the worms are killed, there is no hope of survival. One can only prevent transmission to future generations."</p>
<p>Here are several ancient secret formulas for treating consumption in traditional Chinese medicine:</p>
<p>(1) Qiong Yu Paste: Fills essence and supplements marrow, regulates and nourishes the nature, replenishes hundreds of deficiencies, removes hundreds of diseases, completes all the spirit, fills the five viscera. Ingesting several doses daily is of inestimable benefit and can save a person suffering from consumption (see "Ru Men Shi Shi").</p>
<p>(2) Tian Ling Gai Powder: There was a woman and two men who all suffered from consumption. All were cured by taking this medicine, which functions to expel the consumption worms (see "Lei Ju").</p>
<p>(3) Zi Jin Ding Zi: Treats corpse transmission consumption. Five brothers in a family all suffered from corpse transmission consumption, and three had already died. A Daoist instructed them to take this medicine. They each took one pill and were cured (see "Yi Jian").</p>
<p>(4) Otter Liver: Treats consumption. Take one otter liver, dry it in the shade, grind it into a powder, and mix one qian with warm water. Take it three times daily for miraculous results (see "Ben Shi Fang").</p>
<p>(5) Cat Liver: Kills consumption worms. Take the liver of a black cat, dry it in the sun, grind it into a powder, and take it first thing in the morning on the first day of the month with warm wine on an empty stomach (see "Zhi Zhi Fang").</p>
<p>(6) Eel: Kills corpse transmission consumption worms. In the past, there was a woman suffering from consumption. Her family placed her in a coffin and floated it down the river. A fisherman retrieved it, and she was still alive. She often cooked and ate this fish, and her illness was cured. She then became the fisherman's wife (see "Ben Cao Gang Mu").</p>
<p>(7) Boy's Urine: Treats consumption. Extremely effective when ingested (see "Ru Men Shi Shi").</p>
<p>(8) Bai Ji (Bletilla striata): Treats vomiting blood and coughing blood. Mix three qian of the powder in cold water and take it for miraculous results (see "Ben Cao Gang Mu"). Bai Ji fills and supplements blood vessels, stopping bleeding. In the past, there was a condemned prisoner who vomited blood and bled profusely after being tortured. Regular consumption of Bai Ji powder stopped the bleeding. After being dismembered, the chest was opened, and Bai Ji powder was found filling the lung orifices (see "Yi Shuo").</p>
<p>(9) Insect Wax: Generates flesh, stops bleeding, reduces pain, supplements deficiency. Can be added to pills or powders to kill consumption worms (see "Ben Cao Gang Mu").</p>
<p>(10) Zi He Che Wan: Treats corpse transmission consumption. Can cure in two months (see "Ru Men Shi Shi").</p>

<h3>(III) The Invention of Chemotherapy for Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Western Medicine</h3>
<p>The cause of pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., consumption) is the tuberculosis bacillus. Once this bacillus enters the human body, it forms nodules at the site of entry, cutting off blood circulation. Furthermore, the bacillus secretes an acid-resistant wax that surrounds its body to defend against the invasion of all external medicinal forces. Therefore, even the use of various bactericidal drugs, whether ingested or injected, cannot reach the core of the pathogenic bacteria. The natural therapies, symptomatic treatments, physical therapies, serum therapies, drug therapies, and all other treatments that have been commonly used by physicians throughout history have not been completely successful. The saying that there is no cure for lung disease has spread throughout the world because of a lack of understanding of these profound principles. As a result, modern tuberculosis scholars continue to conduct research tirelessly based on the aforementioned principles. As a result, they have developed a chemical holy grail that completely kills tuberculosis bacilli, called Sanosin. This drug was successfully developed based on the latest medical principles of Dr. Koch, the discoverer of the tuberculosis bacillus, and Dr. Bergell, the inventor of tuberculosis bacillus dewaxing. According to experimental reports from various lung disease sanatoriums in Germany, Switzerland, and other countries, this drug has the effect of penetrating the nodules in the lungs and dissolving the wax, and also has bactericidal properties, which can completely cure first, second, and third-stage pulmonary tuberculosis. It is indeed effective in every test. In China, the National Government's Central Hygiene Laboratory has tested the drug's properties and found it to be safe, non-toxic, and without any side effects.</p>
<p>A brief description of the therapeutic effects is provided below:</p>
<p>(1) When the medicinal effect of "Sanosin" is tested in a test tube, the tuberculosis bacilli disappear after one minute. After three minutes, the acid resistance of the tuberculosis bacilli is completely eliminated, and the tuberculosis bacilli are completely killed without exception.</p>
<p>(2) Animal experiments have revealed that "Sanosin" can penetrate into the tubercular foci. Examination of the latent tuberculosis bacilli within the foci reveals that they have completely lost their acid resistance. This proves that the wax has been completely dissolved.</p>
<p>(3) If patients take "Sanosin" for about a week, they will see immediate improvements such as thinner sputum and lower body temperature.</p>
<p>(4) Continuing to take "Sanosin" for 30 to 60 days or more will result in a noticeable increase in weight, increased appetite, and gradual relief of all symptoms, ultimately achieving the great feat of returning to life and rebuilding.</p>

<p>Stumbling upon nearby neighbors who reported that the ox had been stolen by the slaughterhouse in Beicaojiazhai North Bridge, Chen immediately dispatched someone to the address and barged in. They found the ox already tied up and about to be slaughtered. Chen untied the ox and apprehended the slaughterhouse worker, Yuan Adi (age 26). They reported to the Fourth District Police Station, where Chief Ren interrogated them separately. Given the theft of a draft animal and the audacity to slaughter it privately in an attempt to destroy evidence and sell it, he deemed the act heinous. He immediately prepared a report and handed them over to the District Court for investigation. It was also reported that the local merchants have long complained about the slaughterhouse's daily slaughter of draft animals, which creates a foul odor and is detrimental to hygiene. Furthermore, they have now dared to steal cattle in broad daylight and slaughter them privately. It has been decided to submit a public petition to the Health Bureau requesting strict action.</p>
<h3>Xu Liangcai Files for Divorce from His Wife</h3>
<p>Xu Liangcai, a resident of Shanghai's western suburbs of Fanhua Ferry and a student at a certain school, has retained lawyer Jiang Shiyi to file a complaint with the District Court seeking a divorce from his wife, Wang Ciying (i.e., Xu Wang's family), due to her hidden illness and disrespect towards his parents. The complaint states that the defendant neither lives with him nor assists with household affairs, and she disrespects his mother-in-law. Given this situation, it is difficult to live together, and a divorce is sought to avoid mental anguish. It alleges that the plaintiff, in the eighth year of the Republic (1919), engaged Wang Ciying, the third daughter of Wang Shutang from Panjiaku, Fahuaxi Town, through a matchmaker. They married in the winter of the sixteenth year (1927), at which time the plaintiff discovered that the defendant had a hidden illness and acted like a wooden puppet, similar to someone with neurological issues. She frequently returned to her natal home, staying there longer than at the plaintiff's home. The plaintiff, considering that what was done could not be undone, tolerated the situation. In March of this year, after the defendant returned to her natal home, she did not return for a long time. The plaintiff was forced to ask lawyer Jiang to send a letter of inquiry and repeatedly went to fetch the defendant, who reluctantly returned home on August 17. On September 6, she again used an excuse to return to her natal home and never came back. All her clothes and jewelry were gradually taken away, which was unbearable. Therefore, the case was filed. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Guo Shouyi specially opened the Second Court to hear the case. The defendant retained lawyer Wang Jiahe to represent her. The plaintiff, Xu Liangcai, 22 years old, a local resident of Fanhang Ferry, testified to the aforementioned facts and requested a divorce. He also claimed that in February of the seventeenth year (1928), his mother fell ill and could not cook, so he asked the defendant to cook rice. The defendant not only refused but also spoke disrespectfully, insulting the plaintiff's mother, saying, "My mother has no luck to eat rice cooked by her." Furthermore, the defendant suffers from a mental illness that comes and goes. Sometimes, when alone in the room, she laughs for no reason, or talks to herself, or moves her mouth without making a sound. These circumstances clearly indicate that she suffers from a mental illness. The defendant, Wang Ciying, 24 years old, residing at Panjiaku, north of Fahuaxi Town, testified that she did not want a divorce. The judge asked, "Do you have a mental illness?" She answered, "No." The judge asked, "Do you quarrel with your mother-in-law?" She answered, "No." The judge said to the plaintiff, "From what I see, the defendant does not appear to suffer from a mental illness." The plaintiff replied that her illness comes and goes. The judge, having heard the testimony, attempted to mediate the case in court, advising the plaintiff for a long time. However, the plaintiff insisted on a divorce. The judge then asked prosecutor Yang to attend court and express his opinion. The judge then instructed the lawyers for both parties to mediate outside the court for one week. If mediation fails, a further hearing will be held and a judgment will be made according to the law.</p>
<h3>Lost Girl Awaiting Collection</h3>
<p>Sun Fengzhi, a 17-year-old girl from Liuhe, was lured to Shanghai by a neighbor, a Mrs. Wu, with the intention of selling her into prostitution. The other night, the girl went out alone and got lost in the jurisdiction of the Fourth District of Zhabei. The police brought her to the station. After questioning by Chief Yao, it was discovered that the girl had a mother at home and had been tricked into being sold. Now that she was at the station, she would be sent back to her hometown according to the law.</p>
<p>Sun Meimei, a nine-year-old girl from Suzhou, got lost yesterday in the jurisdiction of the First Sub-Bureau of the Fourth District of Zhabei and was brought to the police station by the police.

<h3>Rickshaw Driver Secretly Conspires with Thieves</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhengxiang Terrified at Night</p>
<p>Zhang Zhengxiang, a 22-year-old man from Jiading, wearing a colored gauze robe, a felt hat, and leather shoes, with a red gold ring on his right hand, attracted the attention of bandits. Recently, through the introduction of a friend, he obtained a position as a clerk at Labor University. The other day, he brought two leather suitcases from home and took the Shanghai-Songjiang Railway to Wusong Town Station. He hired a rickshaw to go to the Sitan Bridge school. It was already dusk and drizzling. When the rickshaw reached the south of the Songjiang Bus Station, north of Tongji University, it was dark. The rickshaw driver suddenly stopped and refused to go any further. Zhang asked why he wouldn't go, and the rickshaw driver loudly replied that he wasn't going due to the rain. Before he could finish speaking, bright electric lights suddenly illuminated the surrounding fields, and bandits appeared from all directions. Zhang saw five or six people holding flashlights and weapons rushing towards him. Zhang knew they were not good people and immediately ordered the rickshaw driver to quickly pull the rickshaw back to Wusong. The rickshaw driver refused. At this point, Zhang realized that the rickshaw driver was colluding with the bandits and that the situation was critical. He was so frightened that he lost his composure. In a moment of desperation, he remembered the alarm whistle in his pocket and frantically blew it. Fortunately, the security guards at the entrance of Tongji University heard the alarm and rushed out to investigate. The bandits, seeing the police approaching, were unable to rob him and scattered and fled. When the police arrived and questioned Zhang, he explained the situation. The police escorted the rickshaw driver to pull Zhang back to Songjiang. Zhang then left the two suitcases at a friend's shop and went out to find lodging. He told people that he was so frightened that he almost lost his life. His face was pale, his expression listless, and his terror was still evident in his words.</p>
<h3>Pleasure Boat Collides with Rowboat</h3>
<p>Rowboat Operator Falls into River and Drowns</p>
<p>Li Deshu, a man from Jiangbei who made a living selling sesame candy, hired a rowboat operated by Xu Gang of number 288 yesterday at 1:00 PM to go to Pudong along the river to hawk his goods. Upon reaching the Pudong Lujiazui waterfront, there was a motorboat wanting to sell six kerosene tanks to Li. At the time, they agreed on a price of 36 copper coins per tank, and the payment was made. As the rowboat was about to cast off, a Westerner named DALTON, driving a white sail pleasure boat number 22, was heading inward to dock. Due to careless steering, he violently collided with the rowboat's left side. The rowboat operator, Xu Gang, who was standing at the bow of the boat, lost his footing and fell into the river. Despite attempts to rescue him, he drowned. Li reported the tragic incident to the Water Police Station to allow the deceased's family to claim damages and compensation to console the soul. It is reported that the deceased was a 37-year-old man from Jiangbei.</p>

<p>Foreign Cloth Boat: Yang Sanhai's wharf boat, loaded with 140 bolts of foreign cloth from the Dachuan Trading Company, was moored on the outer edge of the Pujiang South Osaka Pier's Yiyang Maru steamer at 2:00 AM yesterday morning. Due to strong winds and high tides, the mooring rope snapped, causing the boat to capsize, and the cargo was completely lost in the river. Fortunately, none of the crew were harmed. Gong Jinsheng, the boat boss, reported the incident to the Water Police Station after dawn.</p>
<p>Flour Boat: At 1:00 AM yesterday morning, the Taichangxiang Trading Company hired a wharf boat operated by Yang Chaosheng to transport 1,000 bags of flour. It was moored outside the Bund on Simalu Road, waiting to unload onto the Lai Feng steamer. Unexpectedly, due to strong winds and tides, the boat was overloaded and capsized by the tide, and the flour was completely lost in the river. It is reported that the loss is estimated to be over 3,000 silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Female Corpse in Zoumatang River</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, a female corpse floated up in the Zoumatang River in Jiangwan. She appeared to be only in her twenties, wearing a blue striped short shirt and pants, and her hair had been cut short, indicating a tragic story. However, she had no belongings with her, and the police were unable to find any family members after a thorough search. Therefore, the local constable, Qu Baoshan, was instructed to report to the District Court for an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Those Wishing to Undertake the Western Shanghai Waterworks</h3>
<p>Can Submit Bids Promptly</p>
<p>Deadline at the End of the Month</p>
<p>Previously, the Municipal Government recognized the urgent need for clean drinking water in the Fahua and Caojing areas of western Shanghai. The British Shanghai Waterworks Company was providing water beyond its boundaries in western Shanghai at several locations. Due to strict measures by the Municipal Government, they expressed their willingness to sign a contract with the Municipal Government to formally undertake the western Shanghai water supply. The Municipal Government believed that Chinese companies should be given priority in undertaking water supply in Chinese territory. Therefore, at the beginning of July, it published a tender notice for water supply in western Shanghai, with a deadline of September 30 and a bid opening date of October 15. The deadline is only one week away. Those who wish to undertake the project should promptly go to the Municipal Public Works Bureau on the Municipal Government Road in the new western district to obtain the prospectus and drawings (priced at five yuan per copy) and discuss all matters.</p>
<h3>Western Woman Injured by Car</h3>
<p>Fine of Ten Dollars, Compensation of Three Hundred Taels</p>
<p>Li Guangzi, a driver for a certain automobile company, was driving his car to Baochang Road in the French Concession when he negligently crashed into a car driven by Mrs. Roth, a Western woman, and injured Mrs. Roth's leg. Mrs. Roth reported the incident to the police. Yesterday, the police ordered detectives to bring Li to the French Court for questioning. First, Mrs. Roth, the plaintiff, filed a complaint regarding the circumstances of the crash and requested compensation for the car repair costs and medical expenses, totaling three hundred taels. Li Guangzi admitted that he was driving to the area that day and swerved to avoid a small dog in front of the car, causing him to crash into the plaintiff's car. He admitted his fault and requested leniency. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Li Guangzi to a fine of ten dollars and ordered him to pay the plaintiff 300 taels for losses and injuries.</p>
<h3>Yang Shuhan Dies of Illness</h3>
<p>Yang Shuzhuang's brother, Shuhan, the current commander of the Jiangyuan warship, passed away in Beijing on the morning of the 21st. It is reported that Commander Yang Shuhan had a gastrointestinal illness, which was exacerbated by two months of continuous work suppressing bandits on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, leading to his death. His coffin will be transported back to his ancestral home in Fujian for burial after being prepared in Beijing.</p>
<h3>Members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Visit the Commodity Inspection Bureau</h3>
<p>The executive committee members and supervisors of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce visited the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to inspect commodities. This is because the purpose of commodity inspection is to enhance foreign trade credit and promote the future development of Chinese commerce. It is also reported that the bureau is well-equipped and operates with great diligence. They wished to gain a glimpse of the inner workings to gain a proper understanding of the inspection administration. They visited yesterday afternoon, including Ye Huijun, Wang Xiaolai, Lu Wenshao, Xu Jiqing, Fang Jiaobo, Ye Jiaxing, Lu Qisheng, Chen Songyuan, Zheng Chengqing, Zhu Yinjiang, Yan Esheng, and others. They were greeted by the director and deputy director of the bureau and various department heads. They paid close attention to the various inspection stations. The committee members were deeply satisfied to see that the bureau's various instruments, equipment, and inspection work had reached a scientific level. They departed with great interest around 3:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Gentry in Shanghai Raise Funds to Build a Seawall in Shangyu</h3>
<p>Shangyu's northwest townships are located on the coast and are frequently affected by flooding. They have always relied on seawalls for protection. If the seawalls were to collapse, Yuyao and Shangyu would be the first to be affected, followed by Yin, Ci, Zhen, and Shao. Therefore, building seawalls is essential to protect the lives and property of the people of six counties. A group of over twenty gentry and merchants from Shaoxing residing in Shanghai, including Tian Qiyuan, Pei Yunqing, Zhao Shuxiang, and Li Jisheng, specially convened a meeting of fellow Shangyu natives in Shanghai at the Central Trust Company's third floor the other day to discuss the matter. They stated that the seawall project in their hometown had been undertaken from the tenth to the sixteenth years of the Republic (1921-1927). Through the joint efforts of officials and gentry, 290,000 yuan was raised to rebuild over a thousand zhang of stone seawall. Due to fundraising difficulties at the time, the Sunjia Ferry and Huangjia Weir projects were not completed, leaving them vulnerable to mountain floods and tides. They plan to build stone seawalls and continue fundraising to complete the project. They have already sent a letter to the county government, which has been forwarded to the Construction Department for approval. However, the estimated cost of materials and labor is no less than 80,000 silver dollars. Therefore, they appeal to their fellow villagers and people from all walks of life to provide assistance to facilitate the project. During the meeting, the attendees pledged a total of 24,400 yuan. However, this is not enough. They hope that their fellow villagers will enthusiastically contribute so that the project can be completed. It is reported that donations can be sent to Shanghai Baofeng Bank, Tongchun Bank, and Shangyu Songxia Antai Bank.</p>

<h3>The History of Buick Automotive Progress over Twenty-Eight Years</h3>
<p>— Pei Gan</p>
<p>Buick Automobiles are now twenty-eight years old. Before these twenty-eight years, there were four founders of the Flint Wagon Works who heard that David Buick was manufacturing a type of car engine in the Detroit area. In order to seek future development for the Flint factory, these four went to investigate this new engine in detail. Buick invented a valve-in-head motor that could be used on the road as a means of transportation. The four people from the Flint factory were all senior staff of the factory and were extremely interested in the automotive industry. They went to Detroit together to inspect the model manufactured by Buick. These four were Baron Chiu, Xiding, Begel, and Kemingshi. After driving this car, they observed its actions and structure in detail. After returning to Flint, this valve-in-head motor was sold due to its value. In 1903, these four organized the Buick Motor Company and built a one-story open house in Flint, Michigan. The first Buick car body was manufactured by the Flint Wagon Works, on the same street as Buick.</p>
<p>The tail road test of the first Buick car is described with great interest. The carmaker drove from Detroit to Flint, taking three hours and thirty-seven minutes. The entire journey was covered in muddy roads, which were several inches deep. The faces of the drivers were also splattered. However, this small engine safely arrived in Flint via Pontiac, Oxford, and Lapeer. The actual completion date of the first Buick car was July 1, 1904. The car manufacturing time was almost two months. At that time, Dr. Hall-Smith of Flint was the buyer of this car and paid great attention to the progress of the machinery.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Hall-Smith, the first Buick car had many special features. It could be boarded from the side of the car, unlike the old style, which was boarded from the rear of the car. It had a pressure lubrication system, and gasoline was sent to the fuel injector by air pressure, but the uneven pressure could not be denied and has greatly improved to this day. As for the variation in pressure, it was due to the inability of the crankcase to be tightly closed and not fully airtight. However, this first Buick car was also very durable. Dr. Hall-Smith drove this car for four years before selling it to George Webb, who was then the manufacturing director of the Buick Company. One Sunday afternoon, Dr. Hall-Smith invited Mr. and Mrs. Durant and their daughter to take a car ride. The Durants sat in the front seat and paid great attention to this movable monster. That year, Durant acquired the management rights of the Buick Company. Before long, he moved the factory to Jackson, where the houses were larger. Later, he planned to move the Buick factory back to Flint.</p>
<p>The progress and development of Buick cars have never stopped. Not long after the first car was created, a racing team was organized, led by Bob Burman and Louis Chevrolet. They often won championships in automobile races. The improvement and progress of car engines and motors must occur once a year. Since the invention of the four-cylinder engine greatly increased the engine power, the two-cylinder engine was discarded. The four-door opening was soon adopted as a standard. The driving and management mechanisms were also moved from the right side of the car to the left side.</p>
<p>At that time, the Buick tests in Flint streets were commonplace. A test road was opened in the factory to determine the speed of the car. However, in order to test various road conditions, every new car must be driven to various parts of Flint and between country roads for testing. In 1910, it was the season of depression for the automotive industry. In order to develop its future, Buick resolutely created a six-cylinder car in the spirit of innovation. Since the adoption of the new engine, driving has become more convenient, movement feels smoother, and riding is more comfortable. The style of the car body has also been greatly improved and is becoming more and more beautiful. At the end of 1912, Buick manufactured 94,000 cars, which has been increasing every year.</p>
<p>Buick cars became more and more prosperous until 1919. Because the United States participated in World War I, Buick had to reduce the production of its cars at this time in order to manufacture military supplies. Also, because most of the strong men were in the military, women acted as agents in machine manufacturing. Buick then produced free motors, the manufacturing method of which was the same as Buick motors. Their efficiency was the same. Buick also manufactured many military trailers for the British government during the war. Its engine was the valve-in-head type with a specially made drive shaft. Two weeks after the order was received, Buick submitted the sample car for approval and then manufactured it according to the sample. A total of 142 military cars were manufactured until the day of the armistice, and the order also stopped.</p>
<p>During this period, a major change also occurred in the management of Buick. Premier Chrysler also announced his resignation after Premier Nash. He was succeeded by Lammington, a munitions machinery expert. Mr. Baisaituo was one of the leading figures in the business world. Since Mr. Bai took office, the factory has made increasing progress. Because Mr. Bai is a mechanic, he understands the true meaning of car manufacturing and communicates with various parts of his team. His talent is greatly displayed, and efficiency is increasing.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1926, Mr. Baisaituo became ill in Paris and died not long after. General Motors then selected Mr. Siddon, who had been with the company for ten years, to succeed him. Mr. Si was promoted from the bottom to a key position and was also a rare talent. In the middle of last year, the Buick factory expanded its organization and the products were more refined than before. As for the silver anniversary in 1929 and the new car style in 1930, Mr. Si's efforts were even greater.</p>

<h3>Organizational Methods of the Anhui Province Highway Bureau</h3>
<p>— Wu Fei</p>
<p>The Anhui Province Highway Administration believes that long-distance bus operators in various places only seek small immediate gains and do not consider road maintenance and vehicle upkeep, resulting in road collapses and vehicle damage, leading to business losses. The reason for the lack of vitality is that management is not proper. Therefore, recently, the Anhui Province Highway Administration has adopted a uniform system of business management in order to act swiftly.</p>
<h3>Chevrolet Trucks Displayed at the International Merchandise Exhibition</h3>
<p>Medina, one of the oldest cities in the world, recently held an International Merchandise Exhibition near modern-day Arabia. Three Chevrolet trucks manufactured by the American General Motors Manufacturing Plant were also among the exhibits. Behind the truck is a majestic and beautiful air balloon, which shows the bustling scene (Crow).</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>In order to implement a centralized organization to facilitate unified command, such as checking the flow of goods, distributing vehicle standards, calculating fuel consumption, determining the quality of drivers, etc., each road crew member is responsible for each item. Moreover, a plan for rectification and improvement is formulated and promulgated to various roads for implementation. According to the business report, there are five categories: transportation, ticketing, mechanical affairs, materials, and forms. The main points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Transportation According to the organization of the management office regarding highway jurisdiction, branch offices are established in various districts throughout the province. Under each branch office, a road chief is established for each section of each route to manage transportation affairs for each section. Because the management scope of each branch office is very broad and the routes are different, there must be dedicated personnel responsible for transportation, road maintenance, and suppression. The section chief is in charge of the dispatch and distribution of vehicles on the entire route, the command and supervision of station affairs, and the business income is directly submitted to the branch office. Although the branch office grants the right of dispatch to the section chief, the responsibility of supervision and review still rests with the branch office. The branch office reports the status of vehicle affairs and business operations to the management office on a daily basis. In this way, the responsibilities are balanced, and the management office can know the general situation of highways throughout the province on a daily basis. The establishment of an independent road is like a small-scale branch office. The affairs under its jurisdiction are only related to one route and are naturally simpler. Therefore, a section chief is not established under the independent road chief, and all transportation matters are dispatched by the transportation service chief.</p>
<p>Ticketing Round-trip passenger and freight transportation on long-distance buses relies entirely on tickets. Therefore, each station's custody of tickets is equivalent to safeguarding money. The management office's management of tickets must be even more strict. Therefore, it formulated a ticket management charter for compliance. Tickets for all routes throughout the province are reviewed and printed by the management supervisor. Each branch office and independent section applies for and distributes the tickets to each station for safekeeping according to their needs. The management office hands them over to the branch office and the independent section, and the branch office and the independent section hand them over to each station. Each station fills out a report daily, from each station to the branch office and independent section, to the management office. Daily settlements and income are reconciled before being destroyed.</p>
<p>Mechanical Affairs Long-distance bus operations rely entirely on the operation of vehicles. Their maintenance and repair are of great importance. The original plan of the office was to establish a factory directly under the office and to establish branch factories or repair shops in the locations of each road. According to its organization, each branch factory and repair shop is directly under the factory, but each branch office and independent section has the power to command and supervise in order to handle the repair matters of each road. It is easy to perform minor repairs of vehicles on weekdays. However, full overhauls and reconstruction of the body occur from time to time, and a larger-scale factory is not sufficient to cope with this. However, since the establishment of the management office, the factory plan has not been realized due to limited funding. Only repair shops are attached to the vehicle depot on each road to maintain everything. In the future, when funding is sufficient, the factory must be established to manufacture and overhaul the body in order to recover rights to the greatest extent possible.</p>
<p>Materials The materials of the management office are divided into seven categories: machinery, tools, machine parts, building materials, fuel, appliances, and consumables. It is found that the daily needs of each road are gradually increasing. If strict methods are not stipulated, even if there is a small amount of waste, the quantity will increase over time. In terms of procurement, bulk purchases are easier to prevent fraud and can also reduce prices. Therefore, this office is eager to set up a material warehouse to manage the materials used by each road under its jurisdiction. Branch warehouses or supply offices are set up in the locations of each road to facilitate the immediate receipt of materials by each road. Since the opening of traffic, due to the urgent time, the material warehouse has not yet been organized, and the materials on each road have been listed and registered first. When the material warehouse is established, all materials can be handed over completely without disorder.</p>
<p>Forms The various reports and records of the business are made into single booklets and forms. For the sake of uniformity, they are reviewed and printed by the management office and distributed for use on each road. They are divided into seven categories: general affairs, business, vehicle affairs, ticketing, mechanical affairs, garage, and materials, totaling seventy-six types. In order to facilitate reading, each form is numbered according to its type and prefixed with the words "general," "business," "vehicle," "ticket," "machine," "warehouse," and "material" for identification. The five letters A, B, C, D, and E are used after the number to indicate the binding method. A is a book-style binding with double-sided printing and a fixed number of pages. B is a two-part or more multi-copy form that is a booklet with two or more connected pages. D is a tear-off booklet, and E is a single sheet.</p>
<h3>General Oil Truck</h3>
<p>The above General Oil Truck is owned by the American Mobil Oil General Administration and is used exclusively for transporting fuel at airport. The tank can hold approximately 500 gallons of gasoline and 120 gallons of motor oil. The rear of the truck is equipped with rubber tubes, gasoline cabinets, water tanks, and other equipment. It is long, large, and beautiful. Today, major European, American, and Chinese oil companies and factories purchase General Motors trucks. The General Motors truck has the strongest engine and a wide body. The chassis style has the most variety and can meet various uses. The local American General Motors Company recently received a large batch of new cars. Those who want to buy trucks may wish to try one first, and they will surely be satisfied.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Records</p>
<h3>"Safety First"</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>A prerequisite for drivers A warning for pedestrians</p>
<p>Some people say that "Safety First" is a ridiculous statement that causes unnecessary worry and hinders progress and should be abolished. Others say that in unavoidable or necessary situations, taking risks is also necessary and may lead to satisfactory results. Such views are absurd in today's complex traffic situation.</p>
<p>Driving a car is related to human life and should be done with great caution. The so-called "Safety First" is necessary. If driving is reckless, it is the root of breaking the law and should be strictly prohibited. Recently, various car manufacturers, such as the American General Motors Company, have made many safety designs and mechanical improvements, such as car brakes, car bumpers, car lights, and other safety equipment, and the authorities have been serious about car management. Many tragedies still occur on a daily basis, which is unimaginable. What about free driving without regard for the overall situation?</p>
<p>Most car accidents are caused by the negligence of both the driver and the pedestrian. On the driver's side, speed sensitivity, careless driving, insufficient experience, and dull eyesight are the main causes of accidents. Today, the streets of major cities in various countries have been greatly widened and improved, and the products of car factories are also very precise and beautiful. No more dangers should occur. Therefore, car accidents are often caused by the driver's carelessness and excessive speed or driving as a child's play.</p>
<p>Although pedestrians should also bear some responsibility, the root of the disaster lies in the mutual neglect. Pedestrians often wander on the road, leisurely and carefree, without regard for the movement of vehicles, crossing the center of the street, resulting in being hit, crushed, and killed, and becoming ghosts under the wheels. The blame is on themselves.</p>
<p>In order to avoid tragedies, drivers and pedestrians must cooperate. Drivers should pay special attention to regularly inspecting the engine and parts, have moderation in speed, be extremely careful when turning, and use the horn at the right time. Car accidents can be reduced.</p>

<h3>Current State of the Reading World in America</h3>
<p>— Jùn Shān</p>
<p>Vigorous Sales of Classical Literature</p>
<p>In recent years, the reading world in America has been very prosperous, with unprecedentedly large sales of books. However, the publishing industry has faced great difficulties. Although book sales are extremely high, there are too many books being published, so there are no significant profits to be made in terms of business. Therefore, some publishers have drastically reduced book prices, hoping that people will buy them for their low cost. Other publishers have greatly reduced their output, even by 25%, believing that with fewer books published, the reading public will naturally buy the few that are available.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that in recent years, the number of books published has truly been like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Unfortunately, most of them are second-rate novels and perfunctory biographies of little value, flooding the market and never stopping, making it seem to observers that the American reading world is somewhat abnormal. However, on the other hand, there are some bright signs. Elliot B. Macrae of E. P. Dutton and Co. claims that classical masterpieces of world literature consistently have robust sales. The Everyman's Library, a very famous series of masterpieces, also published by Dutton, has sold 25 million copies since its launch, an astonishing number. And the bestsellers among them are not modern masterpieces collected within, but old-fashioned classical masterpieces.</p>
<p>Mr. Macrae said, "Our publishing industry always spends 99% of its advertising and promotion efforts on new books. However, despite this, the results we get are exactly the opposite. Shakespeare and other ancient authors, for whom we only use 1% of our effort, sell 90% better than modern new works. But there is an even more astonishing aspect to this fact: more than twenty publishers in America print classical masterpieces. Therefore, our efforts only account for a small part of the national market. However, among modern new works, we exclusively manage several of the bestsellers in the country." From his conversation, we can get a glimpse of the current trends in the American reading world.</p>
<h3>Under the Shelf</h3>
<p>— Nán Sūn (photograph)</p>
<p>A large bookstore in New York recently compiled statistics on the bestsellers in the Everyman's Library. They are as follows:</p>
<p>Shakespeare's Tragedies</p>
<p>Dickens' David Copperfield</p>
<p>Shakespeare's Comedies</p>
<p>Cervantes' Don Quixote</p>
<p>Dostoevsky's The Idiot</p>
<p>Plato's Republic</p>
<p>From this list, we can also get a glimpse of the American reading public's preferences. The books they seem to love to read are not in harmony with modern minds. But because they have chosen these few books, new works are inevitably unlucky. Originally, Americans' book purchases are fixed. Ordinary people buy five books a year, and some buy them without reading them. Once classical masterpieces occupy several of these five books, new books are naturally squeezed out. But this is a characteristic of the United States of America as a whole, and cannot be generalized to other countries. In the case of China, the number of people who buy five books a year is already very few.</p>
<p>Fashions come and go, without lasting long. Only the valuable masterpieces of great writers of the past will not decline. What great encouragement this fact is to authors!</p>
<h3>A Guide to International Telecommunications</h3>
<p>The 20th century society is generally recognized as the electrical age. All civilization cannot escape the power of electricity, and especially people who are tens of thousands of miles apart can use telecommunications to develop all their facilities. Therefore, telecommunications is a powerful tool for international communication. However, there are still no specialized books dedicated to international telecommunications. Now, the small Nordic country of Denmark has published a "Guide to International Telecommunications."</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>It mentions the telegraph offices in 50,000 or 60,000 countries that have signed and use international telegraph lines, and specifically discusses telecommunications, radio telecommunications, and telecommunications between the United States and South America. China is not mentioned because they feel that China has not yet realized the difficulties of international telecommunications not flowing smoothly. This pioneering "Guide to International Telecommunications" is particularly practical for countries with developed commerce, such as Britain, France, the United States, and Germany. (Yì Kāng)</p>

<h3>Success of American Wireless Newspaper Transmission</h3>
<p>The experiment of transmitting daily newspapers by American wireless radio has now progressed from ideal to reality. Recently, Dr. E. F. W. Alexanderson and Owen D. Young of the Research Laboratory of the General Electric Company in Schenectady, east of New York City, have achieved a small success in the long-cherished experiment of wireless facsimile in transmitting newspapers. The newspaper transmitted this time was the full page of The Call Bulletin of San Francisco, California. Three hours after it was published in San Francisco, it was able to be read via wireless facsimile over a distance of 2,500 miles. This truly opens a new era for the world, and the clarity of the characters is particularly remarkable. According to wireless radio engineers, they plan to continue transmitting the full daily edition of the newspaper in the future. After the experiment is successful, they will work on other postal deliveries. According to reports, the full front page of the Call Bulletin facsimile was printed using a new type of automatic copying machine using roll paper. The machine can print half an inch in one minute. The full page of the Call Bulletin uses three strips of paper, each eight inches wide. The transmission and printing are currently being tested and improved. (Yì Kāng)</p>

<h3>Impressions of a Northern Trip (3)</h3>
<p>— Sū Líng</p>
<p>Passing Through Dalian</p>
<p>After two and a half days at sea, I disembarked in Dalian.</p>
<p>I called Old Yang from the hotel. He came very quickly. He was completely different from how he was in Shanghai. He was more lively, happier, and more of a gentleman than in Shanghai. This must be because his life is more stable.</p>
<p>"Oh, Sū Líng, you've arrived. Did you have any trouble on the ship?" He was surprised and hurriedly grasped my hand tightly.</p>
<p>"Ah, nothing much. But the Japanese maritime police checked my luggage, just me. Old Chen wasn't checked."</p>
<p>"Yes, your appearance makes me very worried. You called me and told me to come quickly. I thought something difficult had happened. But it's good that you did not. What did you say to him?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that Japanese man didn't speak Chinese or English. I spoke for a long time. When he checked my scrolls of manuscripts and bundles of letters, there was no way. I wrote to him, writing 'This is a love letter,' 'This is a love novel.'" He laughed and went to play poker, but it tired me out for a long time to organize them.</p>
<p>The next day, I went to Old Yang's house to see his paintings because he was going to have an exhibition in a week. He wanted me to write a critique for him.</p>
<p>I was amazed by his efforts. Almost all the works in his studio were those he had already selected. Although there were very few mature expressions there, his paintings were almost a confession of his life. Therefore, his works were all lyrical. I saw three periods and three styles of transformation in his works, which represented the three stages of his life.</p>
<h3>Before the Race</h3>
<p>— Huá (photograph)</p>
<p>The first period was the period of his efforts to organize the Tiānxīn Society. Therefore, the works of that period were full of passionate hope. The use of color and brushstrokes in works such as Tǎ Street Flowers and Mandolin show this. The style of his second period of works was when he was heartbroken by a young woman and before he returned home. Therefore, the works in this stage are full of sadness, sorrow, and poetic sentiment, as expressed in works such as Night of Flying Snow, Bridgehead, and Fallen Leaves. After he returned home, with a peaceful life and uncluttered thoughts, he was naturally able to produce hard-working, calm, and fresh works, such as White Wall and Under the Lamp. These few works are indeed rare and precious.</p>
<p>I immediately wrote something about Old Yang's paintings in the hotel, but I felt very ashamed. Old Yang's efforts had gained him reality, while my wandering had only wasted time, and what I had gained was only emptiness.</p>
<h3>The People Who Live in the Pavilion</h3>
<p>— Lù Xiàngxián</p>
<p>As soon as Mr. Bái arrived at this small pavilion, it became noisy and suffocating because he was a person who liked to hum Peking Opera tunes. As soon as he arrived at our place, he took down the húqín from the wall and tuned the strings himself with "yī ya yī ya." Then, there would be a "The guard reports!" or "When I recall the tears of that year," followed by harmonious singing.</p>
<p>Today, Kǎi also joined. He is a veteran violinist. This made Bái even happier. He stood up, raised his voice, and sang loudly. Máo, sitting on the left side of the window, tapped the rhythm of the quick and slow tempos on the edge of the table with bamboo chopsticks. I thought this was a bit like the scene in the Great World amusement park, turning the entire autumn night upside down. Even the mournful chirping of crickets on the four walls was swallowed up by this scene, and the autumn mood could no longer be heard.</p>
<p>This may be the law of nature: "Extreme prosperity leads to decline." Kǎi inexplicably tired and put down the húqín. Máo's bamboo chopsticks also stopped tapping. Bái had already stretched his head out of the window, looking around. When the singing stopped, everyone quietly looked at the electric light in the room, each silently thinking about their own thoughts, searching for something. Suddenly, Bái vomited a mouthful of air, pulled his head back in, and looked at us. Máo, as usual, made a joke, saying, "Bái, what are you vomiting? I think it's better for you to give up on this matter. There are plenty of women in the world. Why cling to just one?" This further aroused Bái's sadness. Although there was a smile on his face, this kind of bitter smile could not hide the tragedy in his heart.</p>
<p>Kǎi then said angrily, "Damn it, women are really 'disasters!'" He clenched his fist and struck the edge of the bed heavily. Bái was moved by the sound, although it was loud, but with a trembling, gloomy, and slow expression, he expressed his tragic experience.</p>
<p>With angry eyes, he looked at Kǎi's face and asked in surprise, "Kǎi, how did you also encounter misfortune like me? Now it makes me uneasy day and night, even when working and walking, I am in a daze. She cruelly abandoned me, but I cannot bear to leave her. Now, although my friends are trying to persuade me to let go, how can I permanently leave her? Especially in these past few nights, the more I think about it in bed, the more anxious I become, recalling the good times she used to have with me. Now she has changed and is corresponding with another man, writing the same affectionate words she used to write to me. Can you imagine how sad I am in my heart? It doesn't matter if we broke up in our hometown. Now she's changed her mind only after arriving in Shanghai, alas." Bái vomited another mouthful of air, and the expression on his face changed from tension to relaxation. Máo took the opportunity to joke with him, saying, "This is clearly because you are jealous. What does it matter if she writes to another man? I think she is still good to you."</p>
<p>Kǎi then also advised him to take it easy, "I think your matter is easy to resolve. Now that she has come to Shanghai, alas. Only my own matter is difficult to handle. I often want to be a military strategist for others and mastermind the solution to other people's problems. This time it has come to my own head, and I have no way to solve it. I can only blame my family for why they haven't exchanged the money yet, causing me to wait day after day until today. Now that things have gone wrong, if they had exchanged the money sooner, I would have already gone back with her to live a happy life. Damn it, the more I think about it, the more upset I get about spending so much money on him." As Kǎi spoke, he struck the edge of the bed again, as if he were hitting something he hated.</p>
<p>"Money" clearly stirred up waves in Bái's mind. Wasn't the failure of my own affair because of money?</p>
<p>Máo said very calmly at this time, "I think money and women have a major and close relationship. If a man has no money, he will never be able to live with a woman for a long time. I don't think Bái's affair will succeed, mostly because it has to do with money. Kǎi's matter is very obvious. If he had the money, Miss Sū would have already returned to her hometown with you. Why hasn't your family exchanged the money yet?"</p>
<p>At this time, a new path seemed to appear in my heart. I frankly said to everyone, "To be honest, if I had money now, wouldn't she love me? Máo is right. The other night, I went to Lǔ's place to play, and coincidentally ran into her with several female classmates. At that time, I had no choice but to endure and sit down. I listened to them arguing about issues of male and female love, and my heart was as painful as if it was burning. At the time, Lǔ said to them, 'Now, to talk about love with a woman, you can't succeed without money. This is proof of the general reality.' She deliberately satirized me, hinting to Lǔ in a humorous way</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>'Is that so? Of course, we women only love men for their money.' Can you imagine how sad I was in my heart when I heard that at the time? I wanted to walk out immediately, but I thought it was too embarrassing for her. In short, while I was there, she said those words undoubtedly with the intention of satirizing me. Now I want to go to the South Seas, I hear that it is very easy to get rich there. Teaching, doing business, and commerce are all very good ways to get rich. Damn it, I will find money to talk about love with her. If I have money, how can she not love me? You thought of going to the South Seas, right?</p>
<p>Kǎi lowered his head and was thinking about his own affairs. Only Máo listened to his remarks with a smiling face, as if he was celebrating his success in going to the South Seas to make a fortune and in succeeding in his love. "I used to say many nice things to her in letters, describing my difficult life. Only you are the savior of my life. If I leave you, my life will be doomed.' Máo, other people say that a woman's heart is very kind, but in my view, it is more poisonous than a venomous snake. I have exhausted all the good things I can say to her, but she still does not understand me. Her heart is harder than iron and stone. What can I do now to comfort myself? I am always recalling the past scenes between her and me. Sometimes, although I hate her like that in my mouth, in my heart, I am very sad. Cursing her and cursing her is a way of expressing my inability to love him."</p>
<p>At this time, Kǎi raised his head and glanced at Bái. He casually flipped through the messy newspapers on the table, resting his mouth and no longer speaking. "Damn it, forget it, forget it. If it doesn't come in a few more days, I'll pack up and go home. Women are really disasters." Kǎi was expressing his full of frustration again.</p>
<p>Bái felt that it was getting late and greeted them before walking slowly down the stairs and out the door. The autumn wind blew quietly, and he felt that the night clothes he was wearing were thin and not in season. He started humming Peking Opera tunes again, "When I recall the tears of that year."</p>
<p>When Máo heard this, he hurriedly poked his head out of the window to look, watching his thin black shadow disappear at the corner of the alley. Loneliness enveloped the surroundings. Kǎi lowered his head again and was carefully thinking about his way to deal with Miss Sū.</p>

<h3>Era</h3>
<p>— Shuhua</p>
<p>Published by the China Art Publishing House</p>
<p>As long as everyone knows the era we are in now has a significant and urgent demand on us, perhaps the country and the nation will first lay a solid foundation on today's nationalism movement. Otherwise, the flames of white and red will not only terrify and shock us, but in the near future, they will also be able to turn our nation and country into ashes and scorched earth. The era is loudly warning us like this, urgently making such a significant demand on us, demanding that we immediately awaken, caress the wounds of the past, and realize that our future struggle for survival and the success of all events depends entirely on the concentration of group nature and the solidarity of group strength. If we continue to be like a pile of scattered sand with all people asleep, then looking back is already bleak, and imagining the future is even more unbearable. Therefore, today's us, the us who have been awakened by the era's warnings and demands, each of us carries a significant responsibility on our shoulders to promote and move the nationalist movement.</p>
<p>Yes, promoting and moving the nationalist movement is our urgent task, which is also the military order given to us by the present era, teaching us to stand on the battle line and lead the charge, launching strong frontal attacks and counterattacks against white and red forces. We have already started the war, and during the war, we still hope that our sympathizers will unanimously join our battle line and unite to fight for our own nation and country. Therefore, we have demands in today's publications, and we want to find sympathizers in today's publications. Generally speaking, people with considerable literary and artistic cultivation cannot but love their own nation, country, and society. Therefore, after we raised the banner, there were many responses from all directions. Now I have found warriors of nationalism again in picture publications.</p>
<p>In fact, the fundamental meaning of picture publications is the same as other literary and artistic publications, which is formed on the standpoint of national consciousness. However, literary and artistic publications describe it in words, while picture publications express it in pictures. However, the decline of literature and art has already made people feel heartache, and because of such a connection, picture publications have also declined to the lowest degree. Moreover, the editor is extremely superficial and boring, making it even more terribly deformed. In it, not only can't you find national consciousness, but also garbage is piled up, with one piece on the left and one piece on the right, horizontal, vertical, square, and round, all of which are cigarette boxes, orange peels, and those rotten and fishy things that make people want to vomit.</p>
<p>The publication of a picture publication is as difficult as a literary publication. First, the editor must have literary and artistic cultivation, national consciousness, a global perspective, political and other common sense, so that they can have a clear idea, appropriate material selection, and their mission is formed on the standpoint of national consciousness, promoting culture, introducing new knowledge, promoting civilization, advocating art, and improving life. All these are expressed by the editor in the selection of pictures, so that readers can get infinite benefits under reading, and this picture publication is what the era needs.</p>
<p>Shanghai, we certainly admit, is the center of publication gatherings. The publication of all picture publications is like the wind and clouds of literary publications. What we see in bookstores and newsstands with beautiful women's photos and bad colors as the cover are all things of this kind. However, in line with the era and needed by the era, according to my personal judgment, there are only "Liangyou" and "Shidai." "Liangyou" already has its own considerable history to tell people, so there is no need for me to spend words here. "Shidai" has been born for less than a year, but its sharp edges and corners have generally given people affirmation that it is a rising star in picture publications.</p>
<p>It is published by the China Art Publishing House and co-edited by several gentlemen such as Ye Qianyu and Zheng Guanghan, who have considerable literary and artistic cultivation. Therefore, in terms of material selection and arrangement, we can clearly see its conscious center and light and elegant charm. In its conscious center, the editors have a few words that are very right:</p>
<p>"Adapting to the trend of human life and being practical is what is called the era, so no matter who it is, they have the responsibility to serve the era. Based on this meaning, we ourselves hold a pen and a pair of scissors, writing, pulling, tearing, and cutting, always with various kinds of likes in our hearts. It is not that we dare to boast about anything, because we always feel that we have many hopes for serving the era.</p>
<p>We consider the decline of national character a painful thing, so we are not afraid to reveal our own shortcomings. We borrow from the world what is considered excellent for reference, and we will never do what we cannot do. In the past, Greek women went to the Temple of Love every day while pregnant to pray, hoping to give birth to a beautiful child like the god of love. This is clear evidence of the worship of ideals producing facts. Therefore, in Western national character, there are prayers every day, so many beautiful children are born. We do not think about other people's criticism of adopting excellent things, but only admire one thing, not to increase other people's ambition and destroy our own prestige.</p>
<p>Beauty, some people say it is image, and some people even say it is luxury, but we believe that there is a strong original quality in it. In the world, because there is beauty, many interests are born. This interest is enough to maintain human life" (Issue 2).</p>
<p>From the above-copied paragraphs of the editor's words, we know that the conscious center of these gentlemen in editing this "Shidai" is to serve the era, because of the decline of national character, because of the need to worship ideals to produce facts, because beauty will produce many interests, so as to maintain human life. Therefore, when we open a copy of "Shidai," we always see that they have fully expressed their claims, so we more clearly see that they are formed on the standpoint of national consciousness, promoting culture, introducing new knowledge, promoting civilization, advocating art, and improving life.</p>
<p>"Shidai" pays attention to literary creation in addition to the selection of pictures. There is no need to talk about the past. For example, in the newly published eighth issue, there is a short story by Robert Gao entitled "Dawn." Although "Dawn" is about a young man enjoying the night, the national color is vividly expressed in the words. Because the author is a person of the era, a nationalist activist of the era, working on the same front as us, and he is also an orthodox descendant of Guangdong, so his works often reveal the local color of Guangdong. This "Dawn" may be the author's self-portrait. In the natural description, it truly gives</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>We saw it, but the so-called local color is vividly revealed.</p>
<p>"At that time, it was sunset, and it was also the time of the sultry heat. He saw that the family atmosphere at the end of the alley was very lively, so he went over. The three big characters "Tong Le Guan" on the door were clearly visible. He suddenly realized that this was originally a small group of the Guangdong nation. He looked at more than a dozen burly men gathered in the hall, drinking their double-distilled wine. They were eating and drinking with great interest, and rows of oily sweat flowed down their broad backs. They ate very rough, with huge mouths open as much as possible and huge throats swallowing as much as possible. In a short time, like a whirlwind sweeping away the clouds, only the messy leftovers and cups and plates were left on the table with their mouths wide open. He was very envious of their strength and roughness. He also believed that if someone came out to lead them in the future, they would be very powerful and able to win glory for the nation. While envious, he took everything in the hall into his eyes. In the center hung a portrait of Guan Yu, flanked by Guan Ping and Zhou Cang. On both sides was a couplet: "One horse slashes Yan Liang, all the heroes of Hebei are disheartened; single-handedly meets Lu Su, the heroes of Jiangdong are all chilled." Arranged on both sides were spears, swords, and a god lion with wide eyes, protruding eyebrows, a green nose, and an iron bun. After watching it, he thought that although Guan Yu was a martial artist in the Three Kingdoms period, his influence in this kind of group was indeed great, because Guan Yu's righteousness during his lifetime was admired by the founders of this kind of group, so he was taken as the model of this kind of group, so that the people of this kind of group would all live for righteousness and die for righteousness. Although this is entering superstition, the spirit of this kind of group can be recognized by people, that the people of this kind of group value loyalty and emphasize fists. This kind of group can be said to be everywhere in Guangdong, but it is a pity that there is no hero of the era to lead them, so that the national spirit of this kind of group is still buried and not expressed. "He sighed and shot his gaze at the dozen or so burly men. Some of them squatted on benches, some leaned against glass doors, some stood up, and some sat together, holding a cigarette in their left hand, savoring the small dishes they had just eaten, that basket of oil, that heat. Their words and their bodies were as strong. Their words were also as rough as their eating and drinking. They were all frank and innocent. They seemed not to know that society has so-called hypocrisy. Their words were one sentence at a time, completely like their treatment of the enemy, with one punch for one punch. They did not use reason to create tricks to fool others. They used fists to improve their life interests, so they were always practicing punches and legs. This is what is called "sharpening to be prepared."</p>
<p>The author portrays the national character of Guangdong very vividly, as if many real Guangdong people are in front of us, giving us a glimpse of the national character of Guangdong. Speaking from the bottom of my heart, the Guangdong nation is considered excellent among the various nations in China. Just a little bit of adventure and a little bit of rising strength have the potential to compete with the most civilized British. This is worth our support and praise.</p>
<p>"Shidai" publishes excellent pictures and creations with national color. It is no wonder that people say it is a rising star among picture publications. In order to pursue perfection, the editor adds two pages of cold and hot cartoons full of laughter in each issue. "Mr. Wang" is also not seen in other picture publications.</p>
