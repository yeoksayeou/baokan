<p>時評</p>
<p>美國務院否認奴𨽾作工</p>
<p>今日日內瓦電稱。美國務院已通知國際聯盟。否認美公司在斐洲用奴隸作工事。謂目下此項計劃僅在考慮中。而美之所以有此聲明者。因近有提倡人道主義之團體。反對此事。向國際聯盟抗議也。電訊所述如是。吾人尙未明瞭其眞相。亦未敢决其是否用奴隸作工。惟自白人對於黑人之差別待遇一點言之。亦可視爲美國未了之一問題也。美國自一八六零年廢除奴隸制度後。法律上雖已承認黑人得與白人享同等權利。然在事實上。仍未能眞正同等。如南部諸州或規定財產資格。或行敎育試騐。以限制黑人之選舉權。又如公共處所。每分黑白人爲兩處。此種顯然之差別。黑人已感不快。其尤足使黑人憤懣者。對德宣戰之結果。黑人軍亦著勞績。竟不使參與凱旋式。因是仇恨日深人種爭鬬之事日起。黑人由自益激勵奮發。至一九二六年。而阿非利加之共和國。遂告成功。而美國之關心大局者。至是亦稍稍覺悟或於敎育上或於宗敎上。努力爲黑人謀幸福。冀有以消弭黑白之反感。今固已大異於前矣。然差別待遇之形式。雖已漸去。而差別待遇之心。未能盡消。則仍將隨時形之於事實。故爲美國計宜益努力於消除差別待遇之一念。以息人種糾紛不了之爭。奈何今日尙有所謂奴隷作工之一名詞哉。</p>

<p>— 房子廉寄於貴州麻江縣</p>
<p>中央研究院博物館此次組織貴州自然科學調查團。於四月十一日由京出發。經四川重慶入黔。抵黔後。在桐梓遵義貴陽龍里貴定都勻等縣調查動植物分佈情形。結果採得前人所未發見之動植物甚多。動物組於七月十五日抵麻江縣。（即前麻哈縣）當承縣長吳賡棠君及地方各團體設讌歡迎。席次吳縣長述及該縣苗民風俗二則。頗饒興趣。爰誌之。</p>
<p>苗人婚姻　每年舊曆六月二十四日。境內苗民君聚一村。例有迎神賽會之舉。因苗民智識未開。官廳亦無法禁阻。惟屆時爲維持秩序起見。派警到塲彈壓而已。是日與會者。不下萬餘人。以靑年男女最多初抵塲時。即至神前焚香頓首。口中並喃禱祝。未婚男女則於神前敬禮後。即於山坡互相歌唱。此唱彼和。似含無限樂趣。其聲嗡嗡。惜不辨其作何歌也。但見手舞足蹈者有之。掩面畏羞者有之。俯首弄衣者有之。形形色色。狀至發噱。苟男女歌至同意時。即可互詢家世。返家後並可約期會晤。父母雖知而不阻。惟會晤地點。切不可爲女兄所知。否則雙方均蒙不利。數度會晤後。雙方若認爲情投意合時。即行交換飾物。然後由男家正式央冰人往女家求婚。其聘金自十元起至四五十元不等。視男家家境之貧富爲轉移。旣屆婚期。由冰人導新婦往夫家。行結婚禮。惟新婦當日即回母家。須俟生產後方偕小孩同歸夫家。實行同居。否則十年五載。仍居母家。而夫家不得過問也。</p>
<p>避稱老大　江浙等處。對人尊稱曰老大惟苗人不然。因苗人初生之孩。皆非親父所生。故吾人若以客氣稱苗人曰老大。彼則反以爲重大侮辱也。旅黔者其注意之。（却酬）</p>

<p>近見自由談。黄雨齋夫人患急性痢。兩日而去世。友人李可芳。亦患此症。四日而去世。初起俱見腹痛。若李君次日。氣促而逆。上焦膚冷。至第三日痛雖止而暴下如射。仍爲不治。痢古名滯下。若誤認爲泄瀉。用澀法治之。必不見效。且速其死。無論年老年幼。以及病後轉痢。俱宜通而不宜澀。元代大家劉河間之論。最爲精確。其言曰。有謂紅色屬熱。白色屬冷者。謬説也。此由暑濕風寒雜積。非通之不爲功。知急性之腹痛。其雜積必較緩性爲尤甚。用方莫如元代王好古之芍藥湯。方爲生白芍二錢。檳榔一錢。酒炒大黄二錢。生甘草八分。妙在大黄酒炒。寒冷均見相宜。大黄雖寒。酒性則温也。腹痛有芍調之。榔破之。甘和之。能事畢矣。有此一方。是症可不患不治也。</p>

<p>昨日公　李君梅初於莊氏翠竹山房瑯玕萬個。天地皆綠。本絕好消暑之所。李君將往南洋各島。爲商業之考察。一週後即啓行也。客周子。莊氏之戚。能詩善畫。家於甬。新自吳門游覽一回。因謂蘇城內絕少可游覽處。雖城外留園亦甚平常。山塘虎邱。不過略多古蹟。實鮮奇絕之處。余謂周君。蘇城有三絕。子亦嘗過而訪之乎。問何爲三絕。余曰。此三絕者。曲石李印泉閣揆。所常稱道者也。一爲舊織造署內之瑞雲峯。奇石也。今已爲私立振華女學中學部所有。此石之奇偉。殆不减查伊璜所賞愛之縐雲。蓋舊織造署。先爲明季崇禎帝外戚嘉定伯周某之園。此巍然巨石之外。四周奇石不少。有百烏朝鳳之稱。以衆石爲百鳥。瑞雲峰爲鳳凰也。又一。爲文衡山手植藤。其根之巨。過於栲栳。架木柱之。春夏之交。花葉並茂。滿庭皆陰。觀者咸詫爲目所未見也。又一。爲汪氏環翠山莊之假山。乃倪高士雲林堆疊獅子林假山後。以餘石爲之者。結構至奇。蓋占地不大。而自山脚洞中盤旋而上。以達於山頂。路至迂曲。有層疊不盡之意。他處所見。無能與匹也。旣至蘇城。則此三絕者。不可不一游覽焉。周君歎曰。今番失之交臂。異日當特往訪之。座間某君曰。獅子林久享盛名。何以反不得與此三絕並。余曰。是有故。非李閻揆一人之私見也。蓋獅子林自爲某姓所購得。乃大興土木。將原有之石。隨意移易位置。而倪高士意匠經營之成績。遂不復存。聞某名士有詩譏之云。可憐幅倪迂畫。換得龍門貨殖書。此十四字蓋盡之矣。李君曰。誠然。余前月曾至西湖。方信人言如今西子著西裝之非謬也。於是相與大笑。</p>

<p>— 振</p>
<p>上海字林週報。（Norlh　Chinese　Heradl）於八月三日舉行發刊八十年紀念。其紀念册。載有英人來滬小史。雖其中頗多英人自誇語。然於上海開地億情形。有足資參考處。爰直譯如左。以供衆覽。</p>
<p>在滬英人之歷史。即爲上海之歷史。英國海軍並未受別國之助。奪得吳淞口。前進至公共租界區域。過老閘橋。同時英國戰艦。將中國黃浦砲臺摧毀。按黃浦砲臺。即今之英領事府遺址。英軍後開往南京。因而南京條約及附約分別訂立于一八四二及一八四三年。此種條約。規定開放上海及其他四處爲通商口岸。是即爲治外法權及條約口岸制度之開始。</p>
<p>英國作開路先鋒。當戰事之衝。付戰費。開先例。其他國家效顰于後。當一八四四年。英國砲烟掃除一切障礙罄盡時。他國人民。不發一矢而安居于上海之通商口岸。享受一切特殊權利。上海租界。最初二十年。爲英國人所有之割讓地。於是法國人乃另立一種組織。而合于其自身需要者。他方面英國租界。却與蘇州河北岸之美國租界合併爲一。成公共租界。</p>
<p>上海第一任英領事爲貝爾福大佐。職員有翻譯默德赫司特。醫生海爾。書記司特瞻。巴領事于一八四三年十一月八日來滬。越六日始於上海城內三姚路租得一顧姓住房。共五十二間。而成立領事署焉。是時另外來滬之英人。有勞卡特博士及其妻。及派克爵士之妹。彼爲西方婦人足踏上海之第一人。于一九一八年壽終。享年九十二歲。同年十二月（指一八四三年。）有英人二十五人。在領事署登記。內爲河理德懷斯洋行之懷斯氏。仁記洋行之及布氏。頓特公司之司密斯氏。及比爾氏。怡和洋行之大來氏。首先正式租地建屋者。第一圖（指英領署駐州道契）爲怡和洋行。第三圖爲仁記洋行。第四圖爲懷斯洋行。第五圖爲吳考特氏及白特斯氏。第八第九圖爲頓特公司。（按吳考特氏爲一英人。係英國第一屆駐滬領事）</p>
<p>自上海開放爲商埠之首六週內。有船七艘入滿倉。最大者名伊利沙斯特華爾。船重四百二十三噸。最小者名觀熱巴。計重一百七十一噸。七船平均噸數爲二百八十一噸。入口貨值價四十三萬三千七百二十元。出口計值十四萬六千零七十二元。除正式租地建屋者外。尙有外商多人。英人亦在其內。麕集于上海縣城外之河沿一帶。即今之南市。城內住有傳敎士多人。先是一般外人。並不多用租界。以爲營業之地。迨英領事署于一八四九年七月二十一日由城內遷至現在之地址時。方大改變。</p>

<p>一千四百萬包之生產足供消費而有餘</p>
<p>本年美棉市况以世界棉業頹廢致萎靡不振在一角五六分間盤旋者三四月至六月間合作社維持價格之辦法失敗市價乃迅速下降至一角三分嗣政府新棉出估計比上季僅减百分之二七致頹唐之市勢無法挽救雖天氣亢旱影響生育但以棉貨貿易不佳及政府棉產報告與滾存供給充足未能引起買方之注意更以銷費激减與虫害之絕跡市價乃又急轉直下跌破一角二分之關口爲一九二六年大豐收時所有之最低價此後之趨勢將視新棉產與銷費之狀况而轉移</p>
<p>本季政府第一次棉田估計四五八一五０００畝比去年同期减百分之五五較修正數字僅减百分之二七比一九二七年减百分之二四比一九二六年减百分之六此項估計畝數內尙包含有播種後以特殊原因而糜棄田畝在內第一次估計數與修正畝數之差額即爲廢田本季廢田若干無從推算然就一九二零二九年間之廢田平均數爲百分之三五推算本年實收棉田約爲四四二一一０００畝茲將各州棉田比較及十年間廢田平均率列表如上（單位爲千畝）</p>

<p>一千四百萬包之收成雖未可認爲豐收但在目前世界棉業趨向頹廢之時已可視爲供給過剩蓋就現在狀况推測本年美棉消費一千四百萬包已屬不可能之事則季末滾存之數字有益形增加之虞將與一九二七年之七三三八０００包相近成竟超過之即世界棉業能漸形轉機一千四百餘萬包之供給已覺充足六百三十四萬包之滾存亦已無法消滅棉市之趨勢一時實難以恢復上漲而將在低峯盤旋也（八一六　）</p>

<p>法領事之表示劉處長旣將蔡總辦提出各點反復向法領申述並加以誌明當據法領答稱按照該合同第十條租金倘有拖欠租約本可作廢但並未聲明租約作廢之後招商局即不得享用金利源碼頭此爲截然兩事因三德堂純粹爲一敎會機關其神父租地唯一目的即是按期取得租金旣有拖欠自可廢約至於貴局方面所稱按照租約條例載是腏方如有糾紛儘可付諸公斷一節三德堂方面現已預備公斷員祇因招商局迄今並未指定公斷員與三德堂相互洽商以致引起法律訴訟現在招商局總辦旣允指派公斷員與三德堂代表互商一切解决辦法則法律方面自然不成問題法總領事又稱關於法公堂執行廢除租約一節原定星期　二（即今日）繼續審判是否執行但本總領事自當負責使該判决展緩執行藉謀和平之解决並當負責通知三德堂準備與招商局自開談判解决糾紛至於貴總辦表示現在唯一目的即須繼續維持雙方租約酌景增加年租一節本總領事可以必其能與依照辦理但有一點亟須聲明即關於貴總辦所稱酌加年租則可逾約遞加則不可一節本總領事可以代表神父答復總可商量惟担保年租按期收付實爲最要之關鍵應由招商局公斷員與三德堂公斷員以切實之保障應請注意法總領事最後表示本日下午談判大有進步可爲欣慰蔡總辦等表示談判結果圓滿遂相與握手道別</p>

<p>先期防範前月初旬當凌案尙未發生時袁局長即迭據密報謂現有改組派及白崇禧等叛逆心腹廣東人歐添歐熾兄弟及張偉潘七張熙堂歐培等反動份子暗中潛跡來滬勾結本地無業流氓冀圖終期騷動擾亂後方請速飭員弋緝以遏亂萌云云袁局長據報後以事關重要當即密令偵緝隊嚴密偵查以備防範</p>
<p>無業浪人盧隊長奉令後旋即轉知所屬限日查明具復越五日即據偵緝員回報謂若輩現確匿跡於公共租界海寗路粵秀坊及篷路德興里等處而潘七張熙堂兩人確爲廣東著名無業浪人曾經粵官廳通緝在案現在虹口一帶聲譽頗劣</p>
<p>聞訊戒備袁局長得復後立即密令盧隊長督同各偵緝員會同該管捕房按址拘捕毋使漏網並在各該犯住所內嚴加檢查所有書籍信件詎盧隊長正擬着手備理時又忽據報該逆等現已聞風戒備因之未便妄動隨將各情禀報袁局長奉諭稍緩時日俟若輩組織齊備再行一鼓殲滅</p>

<p>政治可以影響文藝文藝能夠左右政治某種政治之下可以產生某種文藝某種文藝的建樹能夠造成某種政治二者有相互關係不容分開的同時文藝是民族的產物是民族發展的過程的結晶換句話講文藝是屬民族的這是不容否認的</p>
<p>在文藝上反對戰爭已經成爲時髦之事他們以爲世界若有民族的存在戰爭即不可免他們認一切戰爭是罪惡之事要消滅民族間的戰爭唯有用階級鬥爭的方法這種意見我却不解當五卅慘案時日人戕殺工頭顧正洪爲何有一般學生來起而後援不顧一切地到南京路上結隊演講游行結果遂造成那樣一個驚天動地的流血慘案凡屬國人無論他睡在任何千萬層的鼓裏到此也完全覺醒了並且無不激昂興奮這時全國同胞一致響應聞者無不髪指於是各地的後援會便應運而生紛紛起來募捐以救一般罷工的同胞平時極其儉約的人到此也願儘力捐助像這樣各種不同階級的人而能起來幹一致的運動若謂階級意識重於民族意識時何以國人要一致奮起而且中國的所謂資產階級何以不去帮助日本戕殺顧正洪的資方來欺壓中國的勞方反而援助中國的勞方去對日本資方反抗呢同時日本或其他國的勞方又何以不起來帮助中國的勞方去反抵日本資方呢中國其它士農工商政都一致地起來運動這又什麼原因呢再最近如大光明開映不怕死洪深君看了是認爲侮辱中國民族而片子上所演的什麼中國人在外國販賣鴉片做賊等等却並沒有註明是大學敎授做的也沒有註明是所謂知識階級幹的勾當那些醜惡的事體那麼當與洪深無關爲何他竟不耐煩地演說起來硬要院主退票子得至這案件在法院開審時聽衆特多在則且特別底興奮竟至轟動了全國各省市的來電報紙又時可讀到像這樣决不關洪深痛癢的事也不關中國智識階級的事洪深個人發狂也罷了爲何全國人都一致地跟着他發狂這又是什麼道理呢</p>
<p>在這種極簡單的極顯然的形况下所謂階級意識之重於民族意識當然不攻而自破</p>
<p>在此就有個久欲解决而不得解决的問題發生這個問題便是民族主義與戰爭問題最近讀前鋒周報第七期狄更生君的戰爭一文把我們久欲解决而不得解决的戰爭問題解釋得痛快無遺淋漓盡致現在節錄最痛快的幾節如下</p>
<p>關於戰爭不論對內對外我們應該認淸牠的性質有帝國主義侵略其他民族或國家的戰爭有民族爲求獨立自由的戰爭有國家爲求獨立自由的戰爭有國內軍閥割據的戰爭有黨流寇式的戰爭對於封建割據帝國主義及黨的戰爭無疑的應該盡力的攻擊在求民族自由獨立的時候在民族抵禦外力侵略的時候這相互的衝突是正當的抵抗是正當的前進中華民族要達到獨立自由目的必先排除一切帝國主義軍閥黨的侵略與壓迫要排除這一侵略掠與壓迫要得到獨立與自由非用我們的力與血去做代價不可我們深信民族的獨立與自由惟有力與血才能換得民族的恥辱惟有力與血才能洗得乾凈我們爲喚醒民族意識的覺醒起見對於求民族獨立自由底一切對內對的外戰爭應該將這種可泣可歌可興可感的事蹟用文藝的力量描寫出來表現出來使牠們永永地刻劃在一般民衆的心裏永永地灌注在一般民衆的血裏使他們知道這一種的戰爭是應該紀念應該歌頌</p>
<p>我們久欲解决不得解决的問題就這樣很痛快地解决了</p>

<p>— 湯增敭</p>
<p>小說月報四月號</p>
<p>最典型的藝術的詩歌在似乎貧弱的中國文壇上是沉寂已久了如果要使它重行振興起來這是含有無限的希望而且是在不久之後的事因爲我們以敏銳的眼光來考察中國的文壇這藝術最高表現的詩歌却充滿了重行勃興的現象而且它底內容與形式都比擬五四時代一般有力的提倡文學運動的學者所創製出來的詩歌有所特異的進展迴然是兩種面目的了這大槪是爲了現代的詩歌作者有較深的涵養寫詩的時候亦愼重其事一洗以前詩壇的怪現象所謂粗製濫造之風同時文藝界的權威者對於詩歌的選擇特別的嚴格簡直用另一種眼光來鑑賞這眞情流露的詩歌這樣纔提高詩歌固有的價值</p>
<p>要曉得企冀詩歌的重行開放最美麗的花朶當然是看一般稍有涵養的所謂靑年詩人的發奮努力每寫一首詩祗求質的充實與精美在量的方面儘希望不及粗製濫造的五四時代但大部份的力量也可以說是詩歌重行振興起來的命脈還是靠了現在執掌文壇的一般誠意的提倡者即在西洋的詩壇也是這樣同時亦必須要有忠誠的批判者突現</p>
<p>在過去的兩年來小說月報未曾刊詩最近出版的該月報四月號突然在創作之前發現了詩選欄包括着六首創作詩一首譯詩使我們對於詩歌頗有嗜好的人看來是多麼引起意外的驚喜</p>
<p>其實我們現在所需要的詩歌是屬於民族主義的什麼充滿了頹廢的色彩悲哀的慘號暴惡的呼聲浪漫的詞句等等來作詩的內容的在最近是不需要即是在未來也是絕端的不需要換言之在目前希望急切地產生的是偉大的揚意中華民族的詩歌前進的向上的爭自由與繁榮的向這方面努力的當然尙有人在最近小說月報所載的詩有幾首是充滿着民族意識的創作竟連鄭振鐸的那首譯詩騎士的死也是這樣現分別介紹於下</p>
<p>劉延陵的蒼　是一首將近百行的叙事詩是以具有最多國恥紀念日的五月作全詩的背景因爲有了這刺心的五月便聯想到日本對我們中國的侵略旅大的指尖上兩個疔的種種不幸的事實來同時作者對於中國也抱着一腔熱烈的希望促醒一般尙留戀於迷夢中的靑年者在他底詩句中可以很顯明的看出</p>
<p>一幕幕我們記得淸淸像富士山容那般淸淸中華是一張葉子嫩靑你像一隻蟲始終經營中華是一位美潔少年誤了被你的粉氣脂馨解開衣衫來看看肌膚天知道這背地瘡毒瘢印</p>
<p>我們先看這兩節詩便可以明白作者寫時的情緒多麼熱烈富有深足的民族意識充滿了字句之間能夠激起讀者對於中華作熱誠的愛護更要感到這樣一位美潔少年的身上竟有這麼多的瘡毒瘢印是如何的不美觀應該如何的去將這背些創傷醫治得恢復昔時的眞面目我相信讀者讀了上面所徵引的兩節詩至少深印着這樣的一個總槪念的確詩是藝術上最高的感情表現它竟能感動人們的心坎而有如此深刻有力</p>
<p>冬天休息了一切生命埀死的枯葉携手力行是說我們如這般奮鬥那一件國恥渝雪不淸春天裏萬卉萌芽靑靑暗示將來繁榮的國命但是它們的深情密意都不及夏五月之刺心</p>
<p>這是眞的我們所有國恥記憶起來是如何痛心的事如果我們團結一致的去爲國努力奮鬥國恥終久會湔雪的更應該曉得我們中華民族在將來是含有限希望的眞猶如春天裏萬卉萌芽的一般充滿了靑靑的生氣這具有無上創傷的五月在我們中華人須源源地牢記着才好作者的象徵力也很强再看他這詩的結束是這樣的寫着</p>
<p>一陣一陣又是一陣　　的記憶滴到天明姊妹們兄弟們不要睡永久聽夜夜聽到天明</p>
<p>鄭振鐸譯的那首騎士的死苦不知其作者係何國的詩人據譯者的附誌裏曾這樣的說此詩譯畢已數年但擱在書堆中一直忘記了發表至今並已忘了原詩著者及所從出的原書了以其激昂可喜特取來發表於此這當然是一椿憾事但是祇詩底內容具有特異的充實而激昂便好了並且這詩充滿了很深長的民族思想可異譯者的附註竟不能提醒到這一點</p>
<p>我喝第一杯酒手握了刀爲他爲祖國而死的人喝這一杯現在很快的喝第二杯這將爲自由而喝那時自由的敵人們是要逃了</p>
<p>我愛杯空了槍子鳴了騎者喊了沒有時候再去喝酒唱歌了來碎杯將去了我的愛衝鋒向敵去沒有比這般的死更快樂的了</p>
<p>全詩富有很深長的民族中心思想終因爲本刊的幅篇關係未能將全詩徵引於此實爲憾事一般寫詩的作者看了這首譯詩眞不知要如何的發奮努力才好同時希望譯者多多的將這類的詩介紹過來</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department Denies Slave Labor</p>
<p>Today's Geneva dispatch states: The U.S. State Department has notified the League of Nations, denying that American companies are using slave labor in Africa, stating that the plan is currently only under consideration. The U.S. made this statement because humanitarian groups opposed the matter and protested to the League of Nations. The dispatch describes it as such. We are not yet clear about the truth and dare not determine whether they are using slave labor. However, judging from the differential treatment of blacks by whites, it can also be seen as an unresolved problem in the United States. After the abolition of slavery in 1860 in the United States, blacks were legally recognized as having equal rights with whites, but in reality, they were still unable to truly be equal. For example, some southern states either stipulated property qualifications or conducted education tests to restrict blacks' right to vote. Also, in public places, blacks and whites were separated into two areas. This obvious difference made blacks feel unhappy. What made blacks especially resentful was that as a result of the declaration of war against Germany, black soldiers also made contributions, but they were not allowed to participate in the triumphal parade. As a result, hatred deepened, and racial struggles increased. Blacks were encouraged to strive for self-improvement, and in 1926, the Republic of Liberia was successfully established. Those in the United States who are concerned about the overall situation also gradually realized this and strived to promote the welfare of blacks in education or religion, hoping to eliminate the antagonism between blacks and whites. Today, it is very different from the past. However, although the forms of differential treatment have gradually disappeared, the desire for differential treatment has not been completely eliminated and will still be reflected in reality at any time. Therefore, for the sake of the United States, it is necessary to work harder to eliminate the idea of differential treatment to quell the endless disputes of racial conflicts. How can there still be such a term as "slave labor" today?</p>

<p>Nanjing: The Capital Garrison Command publicly announced a compilation of telegrams from various parties. (T13-1) Longhai Front: Because Feng's rebel forces learned of the disastrous defeat of Yan's rebel forces on the Jinpu Railway, they were deeply afraid that our army would return and launch a flanking attack to cut off their retreat. Therefore, they launched a fierce attack on us overnight from Zhangshuizhai to Xiezhai, but they were all repelled by our army. The rebel troops died in heaps, abandoning their armor and dragging their troops as they fled towards Lanfeng. We are now taking advantage of the victory to pursue them, aiming to pacify them in one fell swoop. (T13-2) Jiaoji Front: The Central Army, in addition to having mostly advanced to occupy Jinan, a portion advanced westward from Shouguang in separate directions to clear out the remaining enemies in Jinlingzhen, Zhoucun, and other places. Two regimental commanders, four battalion commanders, and about two battalions of officers and soldiers were killed on the spot. Over 3,000 rifles, 14 machine guns, and 4 mountain guns were captured. There were still several thousand remnants who fled north in a state of disarray. We are now tracking and pursuing them, hoping to annihilate them. (T13-3) The Jin rebel forces in the northwest of the Jiaoji area have also been completely defeated by our Allied Forces. They have now crossed the river and are being pursued. According to the captured officers, Yan had sent a telegram to Fu Zuoyi stating that if Jinan were to fall, he would be subject to military law. However, the National Army is strong and powerful, with sufficient troops and food. Our side is unable to defend it, and strict orders are in vain. It is also said that according to someone important who recently came from Tianjin to Yantai, Yan and Feng have excluded dissidents and mixed troops, and the troops have long been disloyal and have been deliberately delaying the issuance of salaries and equipment. There will soon be major changes. Moreover, Yan Zheng is currently fighting fiercely for the chairmanship. Yan deeply hates Feng. Yan has now secretly returned to Taiyuan to guard against Feng. The overall situation will be resolved in the near future. After our Shaanxi Right Wing Army captured Zou County, it advanced towards the provincial capital. On the morning of the 8th of this month, it fought fiercely with Zhao's rebel division, led by Shi Pin, at Doumen and other places, capturing two rebel officers, three hundred soldiers, two machine guns, three mortars, and two hundred rifles. Our Central Army also arrived at Xiyingpan on the evening of the 8th, and the rebel enemy retreated to the provincial capital. Our army is now pressing close to the Shaanxi provincial capital. A portion of our troops has launched a fierce attack on the east gate of Weinan and will be resolved in the near future. (18th)</p>

<p>Detailed Regulations for Implementing Martial Law Following the Withdrawal of the Afridi Tribe from North West Frontier Province of British India</p>
<p>Reuters, Simla, 17th – News from the Northwest Frontier states that the Afridi tribe is gradually withdrawing from the North West Frontier Province of British India. Tribes hostile to the British are now showing fear, as the British air force has inflicted heavy damage on the tribes with its bombing, effectively subduing them. A prominent leader in the Bara Valley stated that the destruction caused by the British air force was unforgettable and that he has agreed to not allow anti-British forces to pass through his territory to India. However, according to recent reports, although the majority of the Afridi tribe has dispersed, some still reside in caves south of the Bara River. The local leader of Turan Zai still intends to incite the Mohmand people to rebel. Two sections within the Utmankhel tribe have pledged to neither support anti-British forces nor allow them passage. It is reported that the British authorities have therefore released eleven Utmankhel people who were recently captured near Parachinar. A dispatch from Peshawar states that the Northwest Frontier Province's administrative officer has issued detailed regulations for implementing the martial law announced by the Viceroy of India on August 15th.</p>

<p>Demanding the Establishment of a Strong and Stable Government and Support for Parties that Uphold the Private Property System</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 17th – The German Industrial Federation has recently issued a declaration that has been met with great importance by various newspapers, which see it as a significant contribution to the election campaign. Liberal newspapers even claim that it deals a major blow to the German National People's Party and the National Socialist Party. This is because the declaration advises affiliated groups and individual members to only support and vote for parties that recognize the republican constitution and uphold the private property system. Therefore, the German National People's Party and the National Socialist Party have lost hope of support from industry from now on. Furthermore, the declaration also calls for the establishment of a strong and stable government that can reorganize finances, reform administration, and improve the electoral system to allow voters and their elected representatives to have a closer understanding than the current proportional representation system provides.</p>

<p>Jackson and O'Brine Land After Staying Airborne for 26 Days and 23 Hours</p>
<p>Reuters, St. Louis, 17th – American aviators Jackson and O'Brine landed here today, having continuously flown in the sky for a total of 26 days, 23 hours, 28 minutes, and 30 seconds. This exceeds the record set by the Tient brothers of Chicago last month by 84 hours. The reason for their sudden landing was that the engine of their aircraft, "St. Louis," caught fire and consumed fuel. It was initially suspected that there was mechanical damage, but after landing and briefly inspecting the aircraft, the cause of the fire and fuel consumption could not be found. These two aviators conducted a continuous flight test last year, remaining in the sky for 420 hours. When they landed then, they were greeted by a crowd of 25,000 spectators. This time, there were very few welcomers, only about 500 people. Even the reporters and photographers who stayed overnight at the airfield did not expect them to land suddenly. The aviation community is paying close attention to the performance of this aircraft engine, estimating that its propeller has made a total of 55 million revolutions.</p>
<p>National News Agency, St. Louis, 17th – Jackson and O'Brine, who stayed in the air for 646 hours, 20 minutes, and 30 seconds, or 27 days minus 31 minutes and 30 seconds, finally landed today, exceeding the record of the Hunter brothers by more than nine days. The reason for the landing of the two men was that the fuel tank in the aircraft ruptured and fuel leaked out; otherwise, they might have been able to continue for a longer time.</p>

<p>Reuters, Wellington, 17th – The Norwegian merchant ship "Pennyworth" is steaming at full speed to rescue the New Zealand mail ship Tahiti, which has suffered an accident. It has now arrived near the damaged ship, ready to provide necessary assistance. However, the ship has not yet sunk, so the 128 passengers want to wait until the larger American ship, "Ventura," arrives at 8:00 AM tomorrow before transferring ships. Reuters, Wellington, 18th – The passengers, crew, and mail from the Tahiti have all been transferred to the American ship Ventura. A telegram from the Ventura reports that the passengers have been transferred, but 148 crew members remain on board the Tahiti. National News Agency, Honolulu, 17th – The "Ventura" received a radio message today at 3:30 PM (Samoa time) that all passengers and crew of the Tahiti have been rescued and boarded. The ship has now set sail for Pago Pago. The Tahiti has been abandoned, and other merchant ships that rushed to the rescue have returned.</p>
<p>Reuters, Suva, 17th – According to radio messages received here today, the Tahiti merchant ship has indeed broken in two. All passengers have been transferred to lifeboats.

<p>National News Agency, Washington, 17th – According to an investigation report released today by the U.S. Department of Commerce, China's foreign trade will continue to be controlled by foreign countries in the long term because China has failed to develop any business-facilitating activities. If China wants to enter large-scale foreign trade activities, it must first develop its domestic resources as much as possible. At present, all business-facilitating facilities, such as insurance companies, trading companies, banks, and shipping companies, are insufficient. In addition, the report lists 56 provisions to guide and assist Americans in doing business in the new China.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 17th – The British airship R-100 flew across the Atlantic from Montreal, Canada, and arrived in Cardington, England, in 57 hours, flying a total of 3,000 miles at an average speed of 58 miles per hour. If the weather is favorable and all engines are running, the speed should be even higher. It departed with 9,585 gallons of fuel and arrived in England with 2,200 gallons remaining. The 75-hour journey consumed over 6,300 gallons of fuel. With the full fuel supply, the airship can travel for 87 hours. However, the airship can hold more than 9,585 gallons, as it can carry more fuel and less water. Fuel can also be used as ballast in an emergency, but water ballast is safer.</p>

<p>Telegram from He Yingqin in Hankou to All Newspapers: I am honored to report that according to a telegram from He Jian, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army, relayed by Division Commander Liu Jianxu, based on a report from Brigade Commander Chen Guangzhong, from the captured communist bandit Jiang Guojie's confession, I was formerly under Tang Shengzhi's command. After the disbandment last year, I drifted to Tianjin. Last month, Peng Dehuai and Huang Gonglue sent Chen Yubai to Peiping (Beijing) to act as a representative to Yan Xishan. Passing through Tianjin, Tang Shengzhi sent me with Chen Yubai from Hunan to Peng and Huang to negotiate. I met with Peng at Zhukuo Factory. Peng sent me, along with Chen Yubai and Jiang Zhengqing, to Guilin to negotiate with Zhang Fakui and Li Zongren, and to recruit scattered soldiers from Qichun, Anquan Prefecture, and other counties. After arriving in Qiyang, Chen Yubai withdrew funds at Zhou Lan's house. It was heard that Zhang Fakui's troops had hidden four submachine guns and eight Mauser pistols in Guiyang and sent me to recruit them. Because I was careless with my words in Guiyang, I was captured. In addition to ordering the execution of the criminal by firing squad, I respectfully report. The case is related to the collusion of rebellious communists, a disaster for Hunan and the country. I respectfully request your examination. He Yingqin, respectfully.

<h3 id="e64">Central Government and National Government's Memorial Week <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The Central Party Headquarters held its 73rd weekly memorial service for Sun Yat-sen at 9:00 AM on the 18th in the Grand Hall. Central Committee members Sun Ke, Chen Guofu, Liu Lu, Chen Lifu, and other officials and guests, totaling approximately 500 to 600 people, attended. Chairman Sun Ke presided over the ceremony and reported that the Central Government's anti-rebel troops had achieved victories on the Tianjin-Pukou, Jiaoji (Jiaozhou-Jinan), and Longhai (Lanzhou-Haizhou) lines. The recapture of Jinan on the Tianjin-Pukou line on the 15th was particularly significant and sufficient to chill the rebels' courage and suppress the enemy's atmosphere. According to reports, Yan's rebel troops south of the Yellow River number no more than 60,000 to 70,000, and more than two-thirds of them have been disarmed and captured, with few remaining. The enemy on the Jiaoji line has been completely disarmed by the divisions of Han Fuju, Li Baobing, Liu Zhentang, and others, who launched attacks from multiple directions. Feng's rebel troops on the Longhai line made every effort to counterattack in an attempt to contain the Central Government's forces on the Tianjin-Pukou line. Upon learning that Jinan had been recaptured by our forces, they were terrified and reportedly retreated under cover from Lanfeng. The enemy troops can be completely resolved within the shortest possible time. For more than a decade, Yan Xishan has possessed troops for self-defense and has always used opportunistic methods to use others as sacrifices to consolidate his own territory. This time, his collusion with Feng was also to use Feng's strength to engage the Central Government's troops at the Longhai line, where the main force was located, and then concentrate his troops on the Tianjin-Pukou line to seize opportunities. Feng Yuxiang has plundered the wealth of the people of Shaanxi and Gansu in recent years to raise troops, and now his rear is unable to continue. This time, his collusion with Yan was also to use Yan's salaries and weapons to supply his needs. Therefore, the Central Government's recent strategy is to temporarily take a defensive stance on the Longhai line and actively advance on the Tianjin-Pukou line, using a large encirclement to annihilate Yan's rebel main force concentrated on the south bank of the Yellow River. Now the military and political situation in the north is fundamentally shaken, and the so-called expanded conference and the pseudo-government being prepared will collapse without being attacked and will not be able to survive. In the diplomatic arena, representatives of various countries in China, due to their lack of clear understanding of the Chinese situation and the Central Government's situation, have had to feign compliance with the reactionary elements in the north. For example, the Englishman Simpson, who was used by Yan's rebels to forcibly occupy the Tianjin Customs and help Chinese traitors, should also be punished under British law. The diplomatic authorities have repeatedly lodged protests, but there has been no response. Their psychology is nothing more than hoping that the warlords will win and enjoy special privileges in the north, expressing sympathy to the reactionary faction in an intangible way. Another example is the Japanese news agency, which has repeatedly fabricated rumors that are detrimental to the Central Government in the past and present military situation. Although facts have clarified that it is not worth laughing at, its consistent subjective intention to help Chinese rebels and hope that China's internal strife will be prolonged and never unified is obvious. The victory of the Central Government's troops this time may give the representatives of various countries in China a greater understanding of the Central Government, making them understand the principle of survival with support and death with opposition, and express sympathy. The economic aspect is also very related to the military situation. Since the rebellion occurred, the Shanghai public bond market has been shaken, and the tariff consolidation and demobilization bonds issued by the Central Government have fallen to 40% to 50%. Finance and banking have been severely affected. After the recapture of Jinan, they suddenly rose sharply again within a day or two and entered a stable trend. The final result of the military is to restore peace, consolidate unification, and implement political tutelage, and to thoroughly eliminate those who hinder peaceful unification, without perfunctoriness, without accommodation, and without accepting any conditions, so as not to repeat the mistakes of false peace and false unification. As for the Communist Party's arson, killing, and kidnapping in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, it can give ignorant farmers and workers a deep understanding and prevent them from being deceived and driven forever. The Central Government's army will soon return and launch a thorough suppression, which can be completely eliminated. As for Wang Jingwei's character, he has a considerable history within the party. Since leaving the party and leaving the doctrine, his collusion with the Communist Party to plot reaction and sabotage the Central Government is undeniable. The Central Committee comrades were very fond of him, and did not impose severe punishment on him at the Third Plenary Session, hoping that he would repent behind closed doors and realize his mistakes. Unexpectedly, he ran out of road and joined the warlords and all reactionary factions to conspire rebellion. His insanity has reached this point, which can be said to be a lack of awareness until death. He did not bear any major responsibility in the party before and after the death of Sun Yat-sen, and his cooperation with Borodin to allow the Communist Party to manipulate power and undermine the Three Principles of the People is his sole responsibility. He was confused by his desire for leadership, and his one thought caused endless disasters, which is truly shameful and pitiful. The meeting adjourned after the report.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the same morning, the National Government held a weekly memorial service for Sun Yat-sen. Gu Yingfen, Zhu Peide, Jiang Menglin, Liu Ruiheng, Zhang Nanxian, Niu Yongjian, Zhu Lühe, Lin Xiang, Chen Shaokuan, Zhou Yawei, Mu Xiangyue, Li Jinlun, Chen Yu, Wu Siyu, and other officials from the National Government's civil and military offices, totaling more than 200 people, attended. Chairman Gu Yingfen presided over the ceremony. Secretary Qian Changzhao gave a political report as follows: Jinan on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has been captured, and the rebel troops have been almost completely eliminated. The Feng's rebel troops on the Longhai Railway have suffered several setbacks in their counterattacks, and our side has ample military strength. Now is the time to take advantage of the victory to pursue the attack. Our progress on the Peiping-Hankou Railway is also rapid, and it will not be difficult to capture Xuchang, Kaifeng, and Zhengzhou. In short, the end of the military affairs is not far away. After the end of this military affair, we will definitely get a long period of peace. Manpower and financial resources should be concentrated on construction projects, the vitality of society can be restored, and the crisis of the country's economic future can be reduced. Changsha has suffered great losses due to the Communist Party's disturbances. The State Council decided last Friday to allocate 100,000 yuan from the national treasury for urgent relief. As for the suppression of bandits in Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces, Director He Yingqin is planning the overall plan. The three provinces have recently been rampant with the Communist Party, and the people have been displaced. The government has full responsibility for local security and should find ways to completely eliminate the problems once and for all. The State Council approved the London International Postal Convention last Friday. The International Postal Association held its ninth congress in London last year. The government briefly sent Shi Zhaoji, Minister to England, and Liu Shufan, Director of the Ministry of Communications, to participate. Later, because Minister Shi returned to China, only Representative Liu attended and signed one convention and six agreements. The ones signed by our representative were: the International Postal Convention, the International Postal Exchange Insurance Letter and Box Agreement, the International Postal Exchange Package Agreement, and the International Postal Money Order Agreement. This time, the government specifically approved them so that they could take effect as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Ministry of Railways to Issue Short-Term Bonds <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>To Purchase Vehicles for the Peiping-Liaoning Railway</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways stated that the Peiping-Liaoning Railway Administration has repeatedly reported that the railway lacks locomotives, which affects transportation, and that the overall situation should be planned accurately to remedy the situation. It also stated that the railway's locomotives are originally insufficient. Among the various locomotives, 93 are between 29 and 41 years old, too old and too worn to be used for long. They should be stopped. Forcing them to be used not only reduces working hours due to repairs, but also delays transportation, allowing the South Manchuria Railway to absorb a large amount of goods. The tangible and intangible losses are enormous. Currently, the precarious maintenance relies on more than 40 locomotives from other railways that are temporarily retained for use to make up for the deficit. If they are returned, the power will be exhausted. Judging from the current freight situation, after the autumn harvest this year, the transportation of goods will inevitably increase several times compared to previous years. Currently, the transportation capacity is already lacking during the off-season, so the precarious situation at that time can be imagined. If a plan to purchase additional locomotives is not decided early, the opportunity will be missed, and both the railway and merchants will suffer. After ordering the relevant departments and sections to set up a locomotive purchase committee to conduct detailed research, the results of the research showed that in addition to retaining 44 locomotives from other railways, if the old vehicles can be repaired on schedule and no special circumstances occur on the line, a minimum of 12 passenger locomotives, 28 freight locomotives, and 2 shunting locomotives should be purchased, totaling 42 locomotives. After Gao Jiyi, Director of the Railway Bureau, invited the banking groups of Peiping and Tianjin to discuss cooperation repeatedly, he reached an agreement with Jincheng, Yanye, and Zhongnan Banks to deposit the funds for purchasing vehicles with the banks on a monthly basis, and planned to issue short-term bonds of 5 million yuan in two batches, which would be underwritten by the three banks. Currently, 20 locomotives are to be purchased first, and the regulations for the bonds have been drafted and submitted for review. Minister Sun reviewed the results and stated that the railway's lack of locomotives is indeed a fact, and there is competition from the South Manchuria Railway, so efforts should be made to catch up and remedy the situation. The estimated cost of the vehicles is approximately 3.6 million national currency. In addition to the Railway Bureau depositing the funds for purchasing vehicles on a monthly basis, bonds of 1.8 million yuan will still need to be issued. The remaining 3.2 million yuan in bonds will be sold after purchasing the second batch of locomotives. The method is appropriate. In addition to submitting the bond regulations to the Executive Yuan for forwarding to the Legislative Yuan for review and promulgation, it has been instructed that the Peiping-Liaoning Railway Administration must wait until the National Government promulgates the bond regulations before signing the vehicle purchase contract with the three banks.</p>
<h3 id="e66">The Southern Fujian Hubei Ocean Incident Has Been Resolved <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Chen Guohui's Troops Have Complied with Orders to Withdraw</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Chen Guohui attacked the Hubei Ocean militia, and over eight hundred retreated to Xianyou. The Hubei Ocean refugees fled to the Xianyou, Nan'an, and Dehua regions, reaching twenty thousand. Yongchun County Chief Lin Zupei, Party Commissioner Liu Chengqing, militia representatives Liu Jimin and Guo Qixiang, appealed to military envoy Fang Shengtang and the provincial government. Overseas Chinese from Southern Fujian also sent telegrams to Fuzhou and Quanzhou, requesting action. The provincial government ordered Chen Guohui to withdraw the Hubei Ocean troops, and the First Regiment of the newly organized First Division, led by Wang Zuqing, took over defense to effectively prevent conflict. Lin Shouguo, brigade commander of the Second Marine Brigade in Xianyou, was also ordered to send troops to escort the refugees back to Hubei. After receiving the provincial order, Fang Shengtang personally went to Yongchun to meet with Chen Guohui and instructed him to comply with the order. Chen expressed his obedience. Fang returned to Quanzhou from Yongchun on the eighth, and on the ninth, he ordered Wang's regiment to depart from Quanzhou. On the eleventh, the advance troops of Chen Qifang's battalion arrived in Hubei. From that day on, Chen's troops began to withdraw, and by the thirteenth, Wang's entire regiment had arrived, and Chen's troops had completely withdrawn. After Wang's regiment departed, the Training Corps also continued to advance to Nan'an Honglai on the eleventh, connecting with Yong. On the eleventh, Fang sent He Xianzhu, former Fujian Salt Transport Envoy, to Hubei Ocean to investigate the people's disaster situation. On the twelfth, he reported back to Fang, who immediately telegraphed the provincial government, reporting the resolution of the Hubei Ocean Incident, roughly stating that Hubei Ocean was the gateway to Dehua and that troops were currently being concentrated from various routes. Chen's troops had to pass through Hubei Ocean on their way forward, and the Hubei Ocean militia had repeatedly seized military firearms, hence the conflict. The losses suffered by the people from burning and looting were also not as severe as rumored. After persuasion, Chen Guohui expressed his obedience and willingness to be the vanguard in the campaign against Lu, and he was preparing to advance on Dehua and Datian. The Hubei Ocean area had been ordered to have a company of troops from the Training Corps stationed there. Gao Jingli's (i.e., Gao Weiguo) troops had also been ordered to concentrate in Anhai, and the abandoned Huian defense area would also be taken over by a team from the Training Corps. According to news from the Yongchun Joint Association here, Chen Guohui's promise to withdraw the Hubei Ocean troops and serve as the vanguard against Lu is indeed a fact. However, because Hubei Ocean is close to Yongcheng and the militia's strength remains, there are fears of retaliation and a request for the reorganization of the Hubei Ocean militia and their transfer to the front. Fang Shengtang agreed that the Hubei Ocean militia would be reorganized by the Military Envoy's Office and would definitely not be allowed to cause trouble in the rear. However, whether they would be transferred to the front to fight against Lu was still undecided because the nature of the militia was a kind of self-defense organization for the people, and the government could not regard them as troops to be transferred at will.

<h3 id="e67">Western Fujian Militia Recovers Longyan <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Communist bandit Deng Yigang Flees to Longmen Creek</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The main force in suppressing the communists in Western Fujian has recently shifted from the army to the militia. This militia can be divided into two parts: the Tingzhou area is the Tingzhou Armed Self-Defense Corps, led by Zhong Shaoying, with a total of more than 3,000 people, who have now defeated the communist bandits in Wuping and Shanghang and are advancing on Tingzhou. The Longyan area is the joint office of the five-county militia, led by Chen Zukang, also with more than 3,000 people, who have also wiped out the communist bandits in Hua'an and Zhangping counties and are now recovering Longyan. The plan is to attack in three routes: one route from Yanshi in Zhangping, one route from Yongfu in Hua'an, and one route from Shizhong in Yongding. After all three routes of the militia reach the border of Longyan, a general attack will be ordered on the communist bandits entrenched in Longyan. The bandit leader Deng Yigang has led more than a thousand people and fled to places such as Dachi and Longmen Creek. There are fewer than four or five hundred bandits in the city of Longyan. The Creek militia learned that Deng's bandits had retreated to gather in that area, and immediately gathered about a thousand people from the Yongfu militia to encircle them in different directions. After several days of fierce fighting, the communist bandits suffered heavy casualties. After the five-county militia attacked Longyan, the rear defense was also planned. The Yongfu area was temporarily handed over to the Hua'an militia, Zhan Fangqi, the Yanshi area to the Zhangping Security Team, Chen Guohua, and the Shizhong area to Sa Zhenbing. Sa has returned to Shizhong from Fushi.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Fujian's Finances After Government Downsizing <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Still a Monthly Shortfall of 500,000 Yuan Starting in September</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Fujian Provincial Government implemented downsizing measures starting in August due to significant revenue shortfalls. It has now been found that each agency has laid off dozens of personnel, with some laying off as many as thirty or forty, and others laying off a dozen or twenty. The agencies being abolished are also close to completing their winding-up process, and it is expected that they will be completed within days. Although there are still one or two sections, such as the Provincial National Arts Hall and the Women's Factory, requesting to be retained, the provincial government has refused to allow them to be retained due to the overall relationship. However, there are also some that are closely related to the overall social life and cannot be cut, such as the West Lake Park, a recreational area for the people of Fuzhou. The monthly funding was originally set at 500 yuan, but this time it was completely cancelled, almost leading to its abandonment. Recently, after consultation between the park's director, Zheng Baja, and the Municipal Works Bureau, the bureau sent craftsmen to work, and Zheng volunteered to manage it, which barely maintained the status quo. In addition, the funding for the Consumer Cooperative, which specializes in the purchase and transport of rice and firewood to stabilize prices and regulate food supply, was originally set at 600 yuan per month, but has now been reduced to 200 yuan. The director of the cooperative, Wu Tong, has submitted a request to the provincial government to wind it up because he cannot maintain it. It is expected that after the cooperative is closed, firewood and rice merchants will inevitably take the opportunity to monopolize, which will hinder people's livelihoods. The laid-off employees of various agencies are currently organizing a petition group to request the provincial government to pay off their back wages so that those who are from this province can find other jobs, and those who are from other provinces can return to their hometowns as soon as possible.</p>
<p>However, downsizing is only one method of reducing expenditure. In terms of increasing revenue, He Gonggan, acting Director of the Finance Department and concurrently Finance Envoy, has drafted plans for reorganizing national and local taxes. However, because this province is still in the midst of the campaign against Lu and the suppression of communists, he has been unable to implement them. As a last resort, He borrowed 500,000 yuan from the Fuzhou General Chamber of Commerce using consumer taxes on tea and wood to cover military expenses. However, the various merchant guilds stated that since the outbreak of the war against Lu, river transport between the provincial capital and northern Fujian had been cut off, and commerce had been completely halted for two and a half months, making them unable to afford the loan. After convening two meetings by the Finance Department, they all requested the opening of river transport as a condition for the loan, so there has been no result. At the same time, the provincial government also received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance stating that the central government is currently implementing financial reorganization and will suspend the assistance of 150,000 yuan per month to Fujian province, and that the 130,000 yuan per month in salaries for Liu Heding's division should be borne by the local government of Fujian province starting in September, according to the recent State Council meeting's resolution that the salaries of the central government's troops stationed in various provinces should be borne by the local governments. The two items, calculated together, increase the shortfall by 280,000 yuan, which, added to the original shortfall of 200,000 yuan (Fujian province's monthly revenue and expenditure originally had a difference of 300,000 yuan, and this time the austerity measures reduced it by about 100,000 yuan), means that Fujian still has a monthly shortfall of 500,000 yuan after the government downsizing. Recently, Yang Shuzhuang is discussing solutions with He Gonggan and Chen Peikun, and has first sent Shi Jialin, Secretary-Director of the Finance Department, to Beijing to contact Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance for relief. As a last resort, during the military period, it is planned to temporarily extract customs duties, salt taxes, tobacco and alcohol taxes, and stamp taxes to meet urgent needs. (August 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Chongqing Press Entirely Suspends Publication <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>To Resist Military Atrocities</p>
<p>The Chongqing press has been subjected to oppression by the military in recent years. In the recent past, for example, the Chongqing Express criticized a brigade commander Lan Wenbin of the Women's Association because his concubine, Ou, was a member of the Women's Association. He closed down the newspaper and arrested the chief writer, Shao Zhengchao, ordering him to bow three times to his concubine to apologize, otherwise he would be shot. Also, the Tuantuan News Agency revealed that the food and drink in the Shizhong Restaurant was unclean, which was a fact. However, the shareholder of the restaurant, Feng Shijun, who served as a quartermaster in Pan Wenhua's brigade, arbitrarily arrested the president and editor of the news agency and detained them for several days before releasing them. After these two incidents occurred, the Chongqing Press Association and the Reporters Association strongly protested to the authorities, but to no avail. Unexpectedly, on August 1, the local Xishu Evening News was suddenly destroyed by a bodyguard, and the equipment in the museum was smashed to pieces. The president, Li Chunyi, and several editors were seriously injured. When the bodyguards left, they said that the social news published by the newspaper in recent days had damaged the face of the generals in Chongqing, and ordered [T13]one[/T] that the smashing incident should not be reported to the authorities; [T13]two[/T] that the smashing situation should not be reported; [T13]three[/T] that an apology should be published in the newspaper to the generals. After this incident, the press unanimously aided the Xishu Evening News, issuing comments on one hand and presenting them to the 21st Army Headquarters, the City Defense Headquarters, and the Public Security Bureau on the other, requesting punishment of the murderers and guaranteeing the safety of the Xishu Evening News and other newspapers in Chongqing. However, the authorities remained unmoved, and on August 4, the Xishu Evening News was destroyed by bodyguards for the second time, and it was stated that the editors would be killed. For a time, everyone in the press was in danger, so the three organizations of the Press Association, the Reporters Association, and the News Agency Association unanimously decided to suspend publication entirely starting on the 5th to fight for the final victory, and issued a notice as follows: The local Xishu Evening News was suddenly destroyed by soldiers on the 1st of this month, and several days have passed without a proper resolution. Yesterday, the newspaper was destroyed again and the staff members were injured. The local associations believe that this matter is of great importance to the safety of the entire press and social security, and have convened an emergency joint meeting to unanimously decide to strike entirely from today onwards, and wait quietly for the public to decide. Work will resume after a proper resolution is obtained.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Soviet Russia Adds River Defense Gunboats <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Patrolling the Heilongjiang and Wusuli Rivers, a Total of Thirty Ships Monopolize the Heilongjiang and Wusuli Shipping Routes, Detaining Our Sailing Ships</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: After the river opened this year, the large Soviet Russian warships patrolled the Heilongjiang and Wusuli rivers once at the beginning of the river thaw, but due to the Vladivostok riots, they all sailed to the southwest areas such as Waizi to set up defenses. All the defenses of the Heilongjiang and Wusuli rivers were replaced by thirty shallow-water steamships built by the Bolly Military Factory. Each ship was equipped with two small steel cannons and two machine guns, and carried thirty sailors managed by one naval lieutenant junior grade. It can travel 80 li per hour. Since May, they have been successively launched into the water and patrolled in sections. Whenever Chinese ships travel to the mainstream of the Wusuli and Heilongjiang rivers, these steamships will chase after them, sometimes firing shots to prevent them from sailing. When the Chinese ships stop, the boats quickly sail away. Such incidents have occurred repeatedly, and our commercial ships have no way to avoid them. On July 10, a Chinese man named Sun Shitou and several crew members were driving a sailing ship loaded with thirty live pigs from Tongjiang to Hulin. At noon on July 12, when they arrived near Tuantuanzi, the border between Suiyuan, the sailing ship lost control due to strong winds and was blown to the Russian shore. The 11th Russian border guard saw them and rushed out dozens of soldiers from the shore to intercept the ship. The ship was unable to move forward and obeyed the order to approach the Russian shore. After the ship docked, the Russian soldiers boarded the boat and took Sun Shitou and others away to the barracks. The Russian officials interrogated them and said that the boat should not have approached the Russian shore. They asked whether they wanted to be dealt with officially or privately. Sun asked what the difference was between being dealt with officially or privately. The Russian official said that if they were dealt with officially, the ship, cargo, and people would be sent to a prison in Bolly and detained for two years before being released. If they were dealt with privately, the people would be released and the ship and cargo confiscated. Sun knew the darkness of the Russian prison in Bolly, so he was willing to let the people go and let them dispose of the ship and cargo. That night, the Russians used a ship to send Sun and others back to our shore. Sun and others then reported to the Suiyuan County Government, but the county's negotiations were ineffective. Since this incident, Chinese ships sailing on the Wusuli and Heilongjiang rivers have been wary. However, this year, Hulin, Raohe, and Suiyuan are rich in opium, and about 100,000 people have gone there to work in the labor sector for several months. Therefore, the shifts of ferrying passengers and goods are profitable, and they still compete to go there despite the difficulties. Currently, there are six Chinese ships sailing on the Wusuli River and four on the Heilongjiang River. (13th)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Russian Spies Captured in Manzhouli <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Russian Bu Chengyanzi is a Russian Spy</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Manzhouli garrison suspected that someone was secretly communicating with the Russian border guards because our recent military movements and border situation were being detected by the Russian side in great detail. About half a month ago, they made every effort to find out and learned that a Russian worker (Maoluo Zuofu) at an iron factory was a Russian military secret agent, and they found a secret code communication. The military police arrested him and sent him to Habu. However, the Russian consuls in Manzhouli and Habu successively protested, saying that Maoluo Zuofu was a legitimate worker. The authorities did not release him because the case involved military espionage. Unexpectedly, on the 11th of this month, the special police in Manzhouli arrested another Russian spy named Bu Chengyanzi, who was a businessman in Manzhouli who usually claimed to be a White Party member but was actually a complete Red Russian. It is said that last year's capture of Manzhouli and the fall of Zhalannuoer were due to this person privately drawing maps in advance and giving them to the Russian army, so they were familiar with the roads as if they were in an uninhabited area. Otherwise, our army would not have collapsed so quickly. After the Russian army entered Manzhouli last year, Bu Chengyanzi served as the interim mayor, managing everything in the city and searching for our hidden officers. This year, after the Russian army withdrew, Bu Chengyanzi still lived among the White Party, privately probing our military situation and reporting it to the Russian army. The Manzhouli military police have found factual evidence and arrested him. He was escorted to Harbin yesterday and interrogated once by the Special Police Management Office. His confession was cunning and he has not admitted it yet. However, the Manzhouli authorities said that after this person was arrested, Manzhouli can have a few less troubles. (11th)</p>

<p>Anhui Sixth District Bandit Suppression Commander Lv Xueshu was sworn in after taking office in Wuhu. The headquarters was also announced to be established. It is now scheduled to hold a district-wide bandit suppression conference in Wuhu on the 26th. The eleven county chiefs of Wuhu, Dangtu, Xuanzhou, and Fan County have been notified to arrive in Wuhu in advance to attend the meeting, and each county's local groups are requested to nominate one representative to participate.</p>
<p>A few days ago, dozens of bandits from Jing County and Qing County infiltrated the areas of Tutang, Shiban Dang, and other places in Nanling Sanlidian. The Nanling County and Jing County defense groups ambushed them in separate ways and engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits. As a result, two wounded bandits were captured, a fake camp commander Zhang Er was killed, and six rifles that had been seized from the Sanlidian Chamber of Commerce were recovered. The remaining bandits fled to Wuhuashan in Fanchang County. County Chief Bao of Nanling has now telegraphed the Wuhu Ten-County Joint Defense Office to report and requested the Sixth District Bandit Suppression Headquarters to send the entire Third Battalion of the Garrison Regiment to Wuhuashan in Fanchang County to suppress the bandits.</p>
<p>The Anhui Finance Envoy's Office has recently appointed a large number of Likin Bureau chiefs, who have been announced as Gan Zepai for Fenghuangjing, Chen Zefan for Hequan, Meng Zicheng for Chaoxian, Wang Manbin for Wuxi, Zhang Jimin for Luochanghe, Yu Xianggugu for Yingheji, and Shen Xinwu for Sunjiagou and Jinjiazhai (17th).</p>

<p>All Circles Send Telegrams to Retain the Garrison Commander of the First Regiment of the Anti-Smuggling Office of the Ministry of Finance, and Concurrently the Guard Commander of Songjiang, Jinshan, and Qingpu Counties, Hu Mingzao, has maintained local order since his troops were stationed in Songjiang. He was able to suppress the wounded soldiers who came to Songjiang. Now that there is news that he will be transferred elsewhere, the public is alarmed. The county government, the Public Security Bureau, the County Chamber of Commerce, the Property Management Office, the Warehouse Management Committee, the Charitable Board of Directors, and the First District Office jointly sent telegrams to Song, the Minister of Finance of the Capital, and Wen Wenyun, the Director of the Anti-Smuggling Office of the Ministry of Finance in Shanghai, stating that the Special Task Force First Regiment has been effective in defending the area since stationed in Songjiang, and that they are deeply grateful. They have now heard that he will be transferred elsewhere at a time when wounded soldiers are gathered, and he is needed to maintain order. They cling to him and beg him not to be transferred to protect the area and comfort the public. They hope the superiors will consider Songjiang's expectations.</p>
<p>The Township Police Carry Out Salary Increases. Chief Zhu of the County Public Security Bureau has previously stated that the salaries of the township police are meager. In this time of expensive rice and firewood, their livelihood is difficult to maintain, and they have made repeated statements of their difficulties, requesting the county government to consider increasing their salaries to show compassion. They were instructed that the bureau should first set up a plan in the city and townships and order the First District Office and the County Chamber of Commerce to review it. Chief Zhong of the district convened the police fee committee and the County Chamber of Commerce to jointly discuss and unanimously agreed that Chief Zhu was enthusiastic about rectifying police affairs and that his request was indeed a real situation. They decided that each police officer, except for the patrol officers, would receive an additional half a yuan per month starting in August. The funds will be advanced by the First District Office and will be cancelled when rice prices fall. It has been submitted to the county government and forwarded to the Public Security Bureau for notification.</p>
<p>Preparing to Commemorate the Martyrs and Publicize Anti-Communism. The Propaganda Department of the County Party Affairs Rectification Committee has issued a notice that the 20th of this month is the anniversary of the martyrdom of the martyr Liao Zhongkai. A memorial service will be held at 9:00 am at the Public Education Center, and it is said that an anti-communist propaganda meeting will be held at the same time to raise public awareness.</p>

<p>Case of Stealing and Selling Kerosene, the boatman arrested. The Texaco Kerosene Company of Shanghai hired Wu Fuyuan of Gu Nailin's boat line last month to transport 600 boxes of kerosene to Suzhou, colluding to steal and sell it. Wu then fled. Xu Deyi, a detective from the Third District of the Water Public Security, learned that Wu had fled to Taixian, so he went there a few days ago and arrested Wu in the county seat in conjunction with the police station. He was sent to the Taixian Public Security Bureau for custody. Detective Xu then returned to Suzhou yesterday (18th) and reported to District Chief Gong. After receiving the report, it was decided to prepare a document within a few days to go and bring him back to Suzhou for handling.</p>

<p>Kidnapping of Shi Guangyuan's Grandson: Shi Guangyuan, a farmer in Taiziwan, about ten li northwest of the city, is over sixty years old and has some wealth. His son died early, leaving behind a widowed daughter-in-law, Ms. Meng, and a grandson who is only five years old. Guangyuan was kidnapped by bandits in the winter of the 17th year and was ransomed for a large sum. However, the elderly and frail Guangyuan suffered from a nervous disorder after this ordeal. Moreover, due to poor cocoon yields and a bad autumn harvest in recent years, his family's situation is not as good as it used to be. Fortunately, the widowed daughter-in-law, Ms. Meng, has managed the household well and is still able to make ends meet. Unexpectedly, at around 6 PM on the 15th, more than ten bandits armed with guns suddenly arrived. Ms. Meng was cooling off at home, holding her five-year-old grandson in her arms and had no time to escape, resulting in her son being kidnapped by the bandits. They left a letter demanding a ransom of 4,800 yuan. The local defense corps was informed of the incident and immediately organized guards to pursue, but the bandits were nowhere to be found. It is reported that Ms. Meng does not have such a large sum of money to pay the ransom and is grieving all day long.</p>

They searched and robbed the store of over 400 yuan in cash that had been accumulated from daily business. Then, they went to the Wu Changmao Grocery Store on the middle street. The owner, Wu Ayun, was unable to escape and was captured. They forced him to hand over valuables, resulting in the loss of over 100 yuan and dozens of items of clothing. The bandits were not satisfied and planned to rob the Ren Dechang Butcher Shop. However, upon hearing the townspeople beat gongs, they opened fire and fled.

<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Your newspaper's Changshu correspondence on the 17th of this month reported that Branch Chief Tang Baoshen had absconded. This is completely untrue. Baoshen requested leave on the 11th of the month for official business to go to the province. The claim that only 40 taels of the 500 taels of Sichuan opium seized were handed over to the headquarters is also a complete lie. The News Daily reported on the 14th of this month that only 40 taels of 300 taels of opium seized were handed over. This shows that the reporters who submitted the news to both newspapers obtained inaccurate information. Moreover, several police officers were involved in the seizure of the opium this time. Not only do local people know the whole story of the case, but also all agencies and organizations. It is clear that Baoshen could not have embezzled the opium. I am deeply concerned that this will cause confusion. Therefore, I am writing to request a correction and hope that you will publish it.</p>

<p>(Surabaya Correspondence, August 2nd) After the Chinese Expedition Football Team was defeated by the weak Central Java Chinese Selection Team, the Surabaya Chinese Football Association was deeply concerned that it would greatly affect the welcome and the presale of tickets was unusually slow. Only about 3,000 shields were collected the night before the match. Who knew that the admiration of people from various ports for the skills of the Chinese Expedition Team athletes would not decrease because of this? Therefore, on the day of the match, Saturday (August 2nd), people from various ports around Surabaya flocked to watch. The streets were filled with cars and horses. By 12 o'clock, the entrance tickets at all distribution points had been sold out. At 2 o'clock, the spectators, in order to grab a position, braved the heat and flocked to the venue. Those who had not purchased entrance tickets also rushed to the venue. By 4 o'clock, the surroundings of the venue were already overcrowded. Even the roofs of nearby houses were filled with spectators. It is reported that the revenue on that day was about 15,000 shields.</p>
<h3 id="e90">(1) Applause as the Athletes Enter the Venue <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>At 4:30, the Chinese team athletes arrived in a long-distance car and entered the venue by bypassing the Nianshi Airport. After changing clothes in the changing room, they walked in through the main entrance with the Surabaya Selection Team in an orderly manner. The entire venue burst into thunderous applause. After the two teams were photographed, they chose their positions. The Chinese team was on the east and the Surabaya team occupied the west. The Chinese team's lineup was as follows:</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, Feng Yunyou, Chen Zhenhe, Chen Guangyao, Li Huitang, Sun Sijing, Dai Linjing, Chen Yutian, An Yuansheng, Cao Guisheng</p>
<h3 id="e91">(2) All-Out Effort in the Fierce Battle <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>After the two sides arranged their lineups, the referee issued the order to start the match. The president of the Surabaya Football Association entered the venue to perform the opening kickoff ceremony. The center forward received the ball and attacked with the left and right wings. Li Qiuguai and Chen Yutian passed the ball to each other, and their connection was excellent. The left and right wings also followed and advanced. However, they were stopped by the center back, Xilong, at the opponent's defensive line. The Surabaya front line counterattacked, and An Yuansheng closely monitored Wahis and was unable to do anything. Although he occasionally got the ball, he could only pass it to the left and right wings and was stopped by Xiao Heitan. Li Ning's tackling skills were excellent and he did not let go at all. Sun Sijing, sitting in the center, fought bravely despite his injury. The enemy found it difficult to succeed. Zhou's iron gate was as solid as a wall, repeatedly rescuing and defending, and the enemy could do nothing. Feng Yunyou dealt with the ball with his head and feet and did not loosen his step. The five forwards were full of revenge and fought with twice the strength as before, charging into the enemy's formation and making it impossible for them to defend. The left and right wingers attacked together, and the enemy was in a critical situation. Li Huitang played despite his illness. Although it was difficult for him to run and his shots were weak, his passing skills were superb and wonderful, which was admirable. Center forward Dai was unstoppable when breaking through the formation. He did not show any fatigue after seventy minutes. Right winger Chen's passing skills were excellent. Since he had not been on the field for a long time, he lacked energy. The left and right wingers were accurate in breaking through the formation and passing the ball. These two players were the most effective in winning the victory.</p>
<h3 id="e92">(3) Chen Yutian's Undeniable Contribution <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Five minutes after the start of the match (4:48), Chen Yutian received the ball and broke through the formation, going straight into the enemy's heart after passing two defensive lines. Seeing that the situation was hopeless, Jiu Xing, who was chasing from behind, could only make a lucky bet to save the situation. He pushed Yutian down from behind. The referee noticed this and awarded a twelve-step penalty kick. Dai Linjing stepped forward to take the penalty. The whistle blew, and Center Forward Dai kicked the ball diagonally into the corner of the net. The whole audience burst into thunderous applause. The success of this goal was due to Chen Yutian's single-handed risk control, and his contribution was truly undeniable. Then, in the subsequent battle, the Chinese team had the upper hand and its military power was greatly enhanced. The spirit of the members of the front and rear coordinated attack teams was redoubled.</p>
<h3 id="e93">(4) Li Qiuguai Scores Despite the Pain <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Three minutes after the resumption (4:51), General Cao broke through the enemy's defenses along the sideline and went straight up to a suitable point. He crossed the ball, and Li Qiuguai chased it. Seeing that the opportunity could not be missed, he kicked the ball straight into the goal despite the pain. The point of impact was excellent, and the goalkeeper was unable to defend it. Applause rose again. After the restart, the Chinese team still had a stronger position. The Surabaya Selection Team was still under attack, and the front line repeatedly returned to defend and was able to turn danger into safety. During the intense battle, the referee made many mistakes due to poor eyesight. At 5:06, the enemy's center back saw the ball coming and was unable to defend it, so he hit it with his hand. Outcries arose, but the referee did not notice it. Then, the offender did the same thing again and again, but the referee did not notice it. At 5:06, when the battle was urgent, Zhou's iron gate received a dangerous ball. The enemy was attacking, and the iron gate stopped to defend it. The referee, seeing it unclear from a distance, suspected that he had stepped over the line, so he blew the whistle and awarded a free kick. Fortunately, the defense was tight and the ball was rejected.</p>
<h3 id="e94">(5) Enemy Takes Advantage of the Weak Defense <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>At 5:11, the left wing Xiao Heitan went out but did not return, and the defensive line was weak. The enemy's right wing received the ball and ran straight up, folding into the center and approaching the goal. He shot fiercely at the goal. Zhou's iron gate dived to defend it, but it was too late, and the ball went into the net. After fighting for a few more minutes, the referee blew the whistle to rest.</p>
<h3 id="e95">(6) Exciting Continuation of the Battle <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>In the second half, the two sides changed battlefields, and the battle became more intense. Each side tried its best, and the excitement was very spectacular. The ball had no fixed direction, and the strength of the two sides was equal. The Chinese side had just cleared the ball when the Surabaya side was in danger again. The athletes on both sides flew like swallows, and were wonderful everywhere. After more than ten minutes of fierce battle, the two sides had not scored again.</p>
<h3 id="e96">(7) Center Forward Cai Makes a Timely Move <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>At 5:37, Xiao Heitan snatched the enemy's ball and dribbled it up. Seeing that the enemy was blocking him, he passed it lightly to Qiuguai. Qiuguai received the ball and took advantage of the situation to pass the ball over the enemy's defender's head. Center Forward Dai, knowing the opportunity, ran quickly to catch up and went straight into the enemy's heart. The goalkeeper was unable to defend it, so it was shot into the net for the third goal. After being defeated by three goals, the Surabaya Selection Team tried its best to counterattack in order to fight with its back to the wall. The left and right wings advanced together, and the momentum was fierce. However, the Chinese Expedition Team's defense was solid and could not be broken.</p>
<h3 id="e97">(8) China Ultimately Wins by Three to Two <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>At 4:46, the enemy's charge was too fierce, and the left wing Wahis was injured and fell to the ground. Seeing this, An Yuansheng's heart was moved with compassion. Not taking victory or defeat as the premise, but with humanity as the focus, he no longer chased the ball and quickly caressed Wahis. Zhou's iron gate also saw this and no longer paid attention to the football, but paid attention to Wahis's situation. Seeing that the referee still did not blow the whistle, the Surabaya forward shot the ball straight towards the Chinese team's goal. Zhou's iron gate could not defend it, and it was sent into the net. The Westerners cheered and applauded, while the Chinese remained silent. Since then, the Surabaya team tried its best to counterattack in order to seek revenge. The Chinese team did not give way at all and ultimately failed to score. After ten minutes of fierce battle, the two sides did not score again. As a result, the Chinese Expedition Team won by a score of three to two. After the referee blew the whistle to end the match, the audience cheered and dispersed. The Chinese team re-entered the venue to receive the commemorative cup and then led the team back to their residence. The sound of congratulations echoed from east to west until they reached the hostel.</p>
<h3 id="e98">(9) Victory and Defeat Do Not Make a Hero <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>After recording the battle situation, the reporter will say a few words to the readers. The Chinese Expedition Football Team's trip to Europe and then to Java was not smooth, and the talents were insufficient, and there was no reinforcement. Therefore, in each battle, the soldiers were mostly injured and played despite illness. We should forgive them for their defeat, and we should praise them even more for their victory. Victory and defeat are common in military affairs. We cannot hate them for their defeat or reward them for their victory. This attitude is not adopted by the wise. The true meaning of sports is not to take victory or defeat as honor or disgrace. There must be victory or defeat in the confrontation between the two armies. If the performance is excellent, even if they unfortunately lose, there is no disgrace in defeat. If the skills are equal, and they win only because of better luck, there is no glory in winning. Therefore, although the performance of the Chinese Football Expedition Team in the games held in various ports is not as good as last year, they have also won and lost, and amazing skills are often displayed. Therefore, we should respect the art of the athletes of the team as always, and never scold them for their failure, so as not to lose our own personality. If victory and defeat are common in military affairs, the Chinese Expedition Team's defeat to the Central Java Chinese Selection Team and victory over the Surabaya Selection Team is even more convincing.</p>
<h3 id="e99">(10) Wipe Out the Old Shame and Make People Happy <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The so-called Surabaya Selection Team is the champion of this year's various port selection teams, and its strength is well known. Last year, Yuehua's Southern Expedition was only defeated by the Surabaya Selection Team in eleven games. Therefore, this time, in the minds of the compatriots, the victory or defeat of the games in various ports has become an unquestioned imagination. If they can defeat the Surabaya Selection Team to wipe out last year's shame, then their wishes will be fulfilled. Now that the goal has been achieved and the wishes have been fulfilled, the team's revenge to wipe out the shame is truly gratifying.</p>

<p>(Surabaya Correspondence, August 3rd) After the Chinese Expedition Football Team defeated the Surabaya Selection Team on Saturday, their reputation soared. Therefore, the second match with the Ethiopian team on Sunday (August 3rd) was even more attention-grabbing. Although the number of spectators was not as crowded as the first day, there were still quite a few. At 4:30, the Chinese team arrived with great prestige. Although they had been fighting fiercely for several days, they did not show any fatigue. After the photo was taken, the referee blew the whistle to assemble the team and choose the field. The Chinese team was on the west and the Ethiopian team occupied the east. The Chinese team's lineup was as follows:</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, Feng Lianyou, Chen Zhenhe, Sun Sijing, An Yuansheng, Chen Guangyao, Li Huitang, Dai Linjing, Chen Yutian, Cao Guisheng</p>
<h3 id="e101">(1) Order to Start, the Two Armies Open Fire <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>At 4:40, after the two sides arranged their lineups, the referee ordered to start the match. The Ethiopian team's front line dribbled the ball and attacked, but only reached the defensive line and returned. After the Chinese team's front line received support from the back line, they counterattacked like a tide, trying their best to resist. The Ethiopian team's back line was not weak either, trying their best to resist. The intense battle was very spectacular. The Ethiopian team's front line tried to attack, but the Chinese team defended step by step and ultimately failed to succeed. At this time, neither side was willing to give in, and the fierce attack and strong defense were evenly matched. In twenty minutes, both sides had not scored.</p>
<h3 id="e102">(2) Chen Guangyao Opens the Scoring <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>At exactly 5:00, Chen Yutian received support from the back line and dribbled the ball straight up. Seeing an opportunity, Chen Guanghui ran quickly into the interior. Seeing that the back line was empty, Yutian passed the ball to Guanghui, who chased up and raised his right foot to shoot fiercely. The ball went into the net, and the whole audience applauded and cheered. Then, in the subsequent battle, the Ethiopian team's front line tried its best to attack in order to retaliate, sending long passes and long shots step by step.</p>
<h3 id="e103">(3) Tie Due to Penalty Kick <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>When the ball was only two points away from entering the net, the enemy's counterattack was due to An Yuansheng's failure to defend, far away from the defensive zone. The left wing passed the ball in the middle, and Zhou's iron gate came out to rescue, but failed to get the ball, which came towards the goal. Xiao Heitan ran forward to rescue. It was expected that when the ball landed, it accidentally touched Xiao Heitan's hand. The referee noticed this and blew the whistle, awarding a twelve-point free kick. Although Zhou's iron gate tried hard to defend, he was ultimately scored on due to being approached. Therefore, a tie was created. Afterwards, in order to win, both sides tried their best to defend and attack. The intense battle was colorful, and the defensive lines of the two sides were repeatedly in danger. Dangerous balls frequently appeared at the goal, but fortunately, both sides were lucky, and both sides did not score. After fifteen minutes of intense battle, the referee blew the whistle to rest. The first half ended in a one-to-one tie.</p>
<h3 id="e104">(4) Two Great Generals Miss the Goal <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>In the second half, after the Chinese team moved the ball, they launched a large-scale attack. Chen Yutian received the ball and quickly passed it to the right wing, and the Flying General chased up like lightning and broke through the enemy's formation. The Ethiopian team's back line was helpless to stop him. The Flying General went straight to the heart and passed the ball horizontally to the center. Center Forward Dai, Chen Guanghui rushed up, but because he had not increased his speed, he missed the opportunity. After the Dragon side's goalkeeper passed the ball out, the Ethiopian team's front line launched a fierce attack like a tide, but Xiao Heitan was flying all over the field, blocking with his head and feet. In addition, the Chinese team's defense was assisting in all directions, and the enemy's plan was not successful.</p>
<h3 id="e105">(5) Chen Yutian Succeeds in the End <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese team then came back strongly, and the back line went forward to provide support, and the left and right sides attacked together, and the enemy's goal was in danger. Although Li Qiuguai played despite his illness, he was still wonderful and had many wonderful passes and dribbling skills, and there was constant praise. At 5:25, the ball was hovering in the enemy's goal area, with feet passing and heads sending. One hook from Li Qiuguai and one header from Center Forward Dai, and the ball fell at Chen Yutian's feet. Yutian did not disappoint everyone and raised his foot to shoot fiercely. The goalkeeper was unable to defend, and the ball went into the net. Continuing the battle, the Ethiopian team wanted to fight with their backs to the wall and mobilized the entire team to attack, but the Chinese team's defense was stable and was rejected. The Chinese team's front line then led the team to counterattack, and the Flying General on the right wing showed his skills to the fullest, winning continuous applause. He charged and broke through the enemy, with incredible success.</p>
<h3 id="e106">(6) Li Qiuguai's Sick Foot Is Not Working <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>At 5:40, the Flying General broke straight into the formation and encountered an enemy. He passed it in the middle, and Chen Yutian passed it smoothly to Qiuguai. Although Qiuguai saw that the enemy's defensive line was empty, he knew that football could not support him and was afraid that reinforcements would chase him, so he took advantage of the situation to shoot fiercely at the goal. Unexpectedly, his sick foot was not working, and he actually exceeded the height, and the audience could not help but sigh. Later, after another ten minutes of fighting, although the battle was intense, the two sides did not score. When the referee blew the whistle to end the game, the score was two to one, and the Chinese team won again. The crowd went home happily. The Chinese team members went to the changing room to drink lemon to quench their thirst, and then formed a team to the field to receive the award before leaving the field and taking a car back to their residence.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Athletics Competition Held in Berlin and Tokyo <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Berlin Wins</p>
<p>Scoring 65.5 Points; Japan 48.5 Points</p>
<p>(Berlin Telegraph, August 17th) Today, Berlin and Tokyo held an athletics competition. As a result, Berlin won with 65.5 points in 11 events, and Japan lost with 48.5 points.</p>
<p>Reason for the Loss: There is no doubt that the strength of the German army is superior, but the withdrawal of two Osaka players in the last minute inevitably shook the morale of the army and the situation was treacherous. According to the competition's nature, the reason for their withdrawal is that it is a competition between the two capitals, not an international one.</p>
<p>Each Has Advantages: Japan's Sumiyoshi in the javelin, Oda in the long jump, and Nishida in the pole vault all ranked first. Kimura's long jump was tied with Germany. Germany's advantages were mostly in track events, such as short and long distance running, high and low hurdles, and relay running.</p>
<p>Crowds Gather: The two armies held a competition at the Caroton Sports Ground, with more than 10,000 spectators, which was extremely grand. The inside of the venue was full of Japanese emblems, and there was a music team playing the national anthems of the two countries. On that day, it rained heavily, and it was deeply feared that the event would not be able to proceed as usual. As the athletes of the two armies entered the venue, the sunlight shot out from the clouds. Guests at the venue included Japanese Prince Takamatsu and his wife, and from Germany, former Tokyo Ambassador Dr. Schaff and current Tokyo Ambassador Dr. Frauches. The two armies worked very hard, but there were no special new records due to the muddy ground and strong winds.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Rotary Cup Preliminary Round Completed <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the United States Fiercely Defeated Japan</p>
<p>No Games Today; Semifinals on the 21st: United States vs. Great Britain; China vs. Portugal</p>
<p>Yesterday was the third day of the Rotary Cup International Tennis Tournament preliminary round. It started at 4:30 PM at the Chinese Tennis Ground. There were two singles and two doubles groups. The order of the United States vs. Japan had been completed. In the last two singles groups yesterday, the United States unexpectedly defeated Japan, winning the rematch rights by a score of three to two. The American overseas Chinese in the venue were all relieved. After the United States broke through the first difficult hurdle, they were confident in meeting Great Britain in the rematch and it was not difficult to win the finals. The remaining doubles matches between Great Britain and Switzerland ended with Great Britain winning three to zero. The doubles matches between Portugal and Germany also ended with Portugal winning three to zero. Great Britain and Portugal have already won two singles groups and one doubles group, and have all won the rematch rights. As for the results of the remaining two doubles groups, they are not important. The situation of each group yesterday is described below.</p>
<h3 id="e109">United States Wins Two Singles Matches Against Japan <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Scuria Wins Over Machida: The Japanese player Machida is a famous player on the sea, and his forehand topspin and overhead smash are his specialties. He is the mainstay of the Japanese team this time. In the first two singles matches, he defeated the American McIsaac Smith with three straight wins, but yesterday he lost to the American Scuria by a score of one to three. The two sides fought fiercely, and both sides were exhausted at the end of the match. Machida was dejected, and the Japanese overseas Chinese were very disappointed. In contrast, Scuria was very proud, and the people of his country competed to shake hands with him, and he was extraordinary.</p>
<p>In the first set, Scuria took the lead and gained two games, creating a strong momentum. Machida was not willing to be outdone and tried hard to fight, using all his topspin skills. The score was tied at four and five games each. Scuria was inspired and won the next game, winning by a score of seven to five.</p>
<p>In the second set, although Scuria once held the most advantageous position with a score of three to one, Machida's spirit suddenly increased and his ball power was very strong. The strong and good-fighting Scuria was unconsciously eclipsed and was exhausted. Machida returned a set by a score of six to three.</p>
<p>In the third set, the American army always had the upper hand and never lost three, so it won again by a score of six to three.</p>
<p>The fourth set was of great importance, and the Japanese army tried hard to retaliate, gaining two games first and showing great promise. Scuria was strong-willed and persevering. He was able to create four consecutive games after losing by two to three, reversing the defeat and winning by a score of six to three, winning the audience's applause.</p>
<p>The two sides had similar physiques and similar hitting methods. Each side had a good performance, which aroused the audience's great interest. Scuria's serve was very skilled and he was able to persevere and fight calmly, so there were few mistakes, which was the reason for his victory.</p>
<p>(US) Scuria 7 5 3 6 6 3 6 3 Machida (Japan)</p>
<p>Smithke and Kitao: In the previous two German singles, the Japanese Kitao lost to the American Scuria, and the American Smith lost to the Japanese Machida. Therefore, both Smith and Kitao were losers, but the relationship between the gains and losses of both sides was not light, so they had to do their best to fight. Smith's attitude was very calm, and his ball was never empty. His serving skills could be compared with the German Scuria. Both used long guns to challenge. Smith attacked in the east and west, leaving Kitao no time to run. As a result, Smith won by a score of three to zero. Comparing Smith's skills yesterday with the battle against Machida the other day, they were like two different people. The comparison is as follows:</p>
<p>(US) Smith 6 2 6 3 6 3 Kitao (Japan)</p>
<h3 id="e110">Portugal Defeats Germany in Doubles <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>In yesterday's doubles match between Portugal and Germany, the Portuguese players were Carvalho and S. Korasha, while Germany still fielded Crowe and Ibert, the singles players from the other day. In comparison, Germany's strength was far inferior. The German player, Ibert, was very portly and obese, weighing at least two hundred forty or fifty pounds. He could neither run nor bend, but his hitting technique was quite good; he could calmly hit the ball when it came near him, which was not easy. As a result, Portugal won three sets in a row.</p>
<p>(Portugal) Carvalho S. Korasha 63 62 61 Crowe Ibert (Germany)</p>
<h3 id="e111">England Defeats Switzerland in Doubles <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's doubles match between England and Switzerland also resulted in a victory for England. England had veteran White and George pairing up, with ample fighting strength. Switzerland still fielded Atdot and White Instruments. The match was decided in three sets, with the total number of games being 21. Switzerland only won three games. The comparison is as follows:</p>
<p>(England) White George 61 62 60 Atdot White Instruments (Switzerland)</p>
<p>In the preliminary rounds, the United States defeated Japan 3-2, England defeated Switzerland 3-0, and Portugal defeated Germany 3-0, all securing spots in the semi-finals. Although England, Switzerland, Portugal, and Germany each have two singles matches remaining, the outcomes are irrelevant, so they will not be held today. The semi-final schedule is as follows: the United States vs. England, and China vs. Portugal, starting on the 21st.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor Dear Editor, In the education column of your newspaper on the 17th, there was a piece about the turmoil at Fudan Practical Middle School. This news was the result of a conversation with a certain old classmate from Fudan University and is not directly related to the problems of our school or clear about the circumstances of this incident. The motive for the organization of the faculty and staff school protection association of our school is to maintain the dignity of the education community and the excellent and special spirit of our school, as well as the autonomy stipulated in the contract between our school and the university. All actions are based on these reasons. Our school has now been officially taken over by Mr. Li Baohuan, according to the resolution of the general meeting of all faculty and staff last semester, in conjunction with the school protection association, and all important school documents, including contracts and seals, are fully kept. On the one hand, Director Chen Wangdao is requested to return to school to handle affairs after his leave. Before Director Chen agrees to return to school, fortunately, Mr. Li is responsible for all school affairs and invites all faculty and staff to work hard to maintain normal operations so as not to cause disputes and suspension. This is the situation of our school's dispute. As for the detailed situation, it can be found in our school's ten-day publication and the two declarations of the school protection association. This letter is hereby sent for your peace of mind. Sincerely, Fudan Experimental Middle School August 17th</p>

<h3 id="e115">A Brief Account of Miao Customs in Guizhou Province <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Zilian, sent from Majiang County, Guizhou Province</p>
<p>The Museum of the Academia Sinica recently organized a natural science survey team for Guizhou. It departed from Beijing on April 11th, entered Guizhou via Chongqing, Sichuan. After arriving in Guizhou, the team investigated the distribution of flora and fauna in counties such as Tongzi, Zunyi, Guiyang, Longli, Guiding, and Duyun. As a result, many flora and fauna that had not been discovered by predecessors were collected. The animal group arrived in Majiang County (formerly Maha County) on July 15th. County Magistrate Wu Gengtang and local groups hosted a banquet to welcome them. During the banquet, County Magistrate Wu described two Miao customs in the county, which were quite interesting. I hereby record them.</p>
<p>Miao Marriage: Every year on the 24th day of the sixth month of the lunar calendar, the Miao people in the territory gather in a village. There is a customary welcoming of gods and a race meeting. Because the Miao people's intelligence is not developed, the official government cannot prohibit it. However, in order to maintain order at the time, the police are dispatched to the scene to suppress it. On this day, no less than ten thousand people attend the meeting, with the most being young men and women. When they first arrive at the scene, they go to the gods to burn incense and kowtow, and they also murmur prayers in their mouths. Unmarried men and women pay their respects to the gods and then sing to each other on the hillside. This singing and that harmony seem to contain infinite pleasure. The sound is buzzing, but it is a pity that it cannot be discerned what song is being sung. But there are those who dance with their hands and feet, those who cover their faces in shyness, and those who lower their heads and play with their clothes. All kinds of shapes and colors are extremely laughable. If men and women sing to agree, they can ask each other about their families. After returning home, they can also arrange to meet. Parents know but do not stop them. However, the meeting place must not be known to the woman's older sister, otherwise both parties will suffer. After several meetings, if both parties think that they are in love, they will exchange ornaments. Then the man's family officially asks an intermediary to propose marriage to the woman's family. The bride price ranges from ten yuan to forty or fifty yuan, depending on the poverty or wealth of the man's family. When the wedding date arrives, the intermediary leads the bride to the husband's house for the wedding ceremony. However, the bride returns to her mother's house on the same day. She must wait until after childbirth before returning to the husband's house with the child to live together. Otherwise, she will still live in her mother's house for ten or five years, and the husband's family cannot intervene.</p>
<p>Avoid Calling Someone "Oldest": In Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other places, people respectfully call others "Oldest." However, the Miao people are not like that. Because the firstborn child of the Miao people is not born to the biological father. Therefore, if we politely call a Miao person "Oldest," they will think it is a major insult. Travelers in Guizhou should pay attention to this. (Compensation)</p>
<h3 id="e116">Treatment for Acute Dysentery <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Zhizhi Jushi</p>
<p>Recently, I saw in Free Talk that Mrs. Huang Yuzhai suffered from acute dysentery and died in two days. My friend Li Kefang also suffered from this disease and died in four days. At the beginning, both had abdominal pain. In the case of Mr. Li, on the second day, he had shortness of breath and vomiting, and his upper body felt cold. By the third day, although the pain had stopped, he had explosive diarrhea, which was still incurable. Dysentery was called Zhixia in ancient times. If it is mistakenly regarded as diarrhea and treated with astringent methods, it will not be effective and will hasten death. Whether it is old or young, or dysentery after illness, it should be treated by clearing and not by astringency. The theory of Liu Hejian, a great master of the Yuan Dynasty, is the most accurate. He said: "It is a fallacy to say that red is hot and white is cold. This is caused by the accumulation of summer heat, dampness, wind, and cold. It will not work if it is not cleared." Knowing that acute abdominal pain must have more accumulation than chronic pain. The best prescription is Wang Haogu's Peony Decoction from the Yuan Dynasty. The prescription is: raw white peony two qian, betel nut one qian, wine-fried rhubarb two qian, raw licorice eight fen. The beauty lies in the wine-fried rhubarb. Cold and cold are both suitable. Although rhubarb is cold, wine is warm. Peony harmonizes the abdominal pain, betel nut breaks it, and licorice harmonizes it. The task is completed. With this prescription, this disease need not be feared to be incurable.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Three Wonders of Suzhou <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Dao Di</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Li Meichu and I visited the Villa of Emerald Bamboo belonging to Mr. Zhuang in Suzhou, with ten thousand pieces of bamboo and greenery all around, an excellent place to escape the summer heat. Mr. Li will be going to the islands of Southeast Asia for a commercial survey and will be leaving in a week. Guest Zhou Zi, a relative of Mr. Zhuang, is skilled in poetry and painting and lives in Yong. He has just returned from a tour of Suzhou and said that there are very few places to visit in Suzhou, and even the Lingering Garden outside the city is very ordinary. Shantang and Tiger Hill only have a few historical sites and are not particularly wonderful. I said to Mr. Zhou, "Suzhou has three wonders. Have you ever visited them?" He asked, "What are the three wonders?" I said, "These three wonders are often praised by Qu Shi Li Yinquan, a cabinet scholar. One is the Ruiyun Peak in the old Weaving Bureau, a strange stone. It is now owned by the secondary school of the private Zhenhua Girls' School. The magnificence of this stone is almost comparable to the Zheyun admired by Zha Yihuang. The old Weaving Bureau was formerly the garden of Zhou, the maternal uncle of Emperor Chongzhen of the Ming Dynasty. In addition to this towering giant stone, there are many strange stones around it, known as the Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix, with the many stones representing the hundred birds and the Ruiyun Peak representing the phoenix. Another is the Wisteria planted by Wen Zhengming. Its roots are larger than a basket. It is supported by wooden pillars. In the spring and summer, flowers and leaves are luxuriant, and the courtyard is full of shade. Viewers are amazed that they have never seen it before. The other is the rockery of Wang's Huan Cui Villa. It was made by Ni Yunlin after stacking the Lion Grove rockery with the remaining stones. The structure is extremely strange. It occupies a small area, but it spirals up from the foot of the mountain into the cave to reach the top of the mountain. The road is very winding, with a sense of endless layers. What is seen elsewhere cannot be compared. Having come to Suzhou, these three wonders must be visited." Mr. Zhou sighed, "I missed it this time. I will definitely visit it specially in the future." A gentleman at the table said, "Lion Grove has long enjoyed a great reputation. Why can't it be compared with these three wonders?" I said, "There is a reason for this. It is not just the private opinion of Li Yan Kui. Since Lion Grove was bought by a certain family, they have made great changes, moving the original stones at will, and the achievements of Ni Gaoshi's design and management no longer exist. I heard that a certain celebrity has a poem mocking it, saying, 'It is a pity that the painting of Ni Zan has been exchanged for a book on the cargo trade of Longmen.' These fourteen words cover it all." Mr. Li said, "Indeed. I went to West Lake last month and believed that people say that the current Xizi is not wrong in wearing a suit." Then they laughed together.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Bamboo Leaf Shoes <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>The bamboo forest is shaded, the green leaves are shaking, the air is fresh, and the sun is shielded. In the past, those who traveled on dry roads, passing under the bamboo forest, loved to pick three or five tender leaves and pad them under their shoes to cool their toes and walk lightly, which was convenient for walking. There was a wealthy gentleman in Jiangbei, Gu, who had many concubines. There was a bamboo garden in his house. In the summer, the concubines cooled off in it, competing in gorgeous evening dresses. Light gauze was as thin as cicada wings. These women all liked to wear slippers, taking them to be cool and convenient. There was a Wu concubine who was twenty-nine years old and had a very clever nature. The other day, she invited her companions to pick bamboo leaves in the cool evening, filling a basket. (When picking, they took the ones with large leaves and green color to use. After picking, each leaf was split into several pieces, and then they began to weave a kind of fabric. Those who saw it all praised it. The next day, suddenly saw that the concubine made a pair of slippers, completely woven of bamboo leaves. The color was as blue as washing, and the green was dripping. At that time, a certain concubine proposed, "On the shoes, it is appropriate to attach bright pearls and embroider ocher petals to match the color." The proposal was approved. Everyone joined in a large-scale work. Wu promised. Some helped to embroider flowers, and some helped to pick leaves. Wu wove all day long. In a few days, each concubine had a pair. When wearing, they were a hundred times cooler than ordinary slippers. Moreover, the green shoes were embellished with a touch of ocher flowers and a few bright pearls, making them more gorgeous and lovely. From then on, the round six-inch feet had something to rely on. In the laughter, they all boasted that the bamboo leaf shoes were comfortable to wear, a hundred times more valuable than the slippers sold on the market.</p>
<h3 id="e119">A Short History of the British in Shanghai (1) <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>The Shanghai North-China Herald held its 80th anniversary of publication on August 3rd. Its commemorative volume contains a short history of the British in Shanghai. Although there are many self-praising words in it, it has reference value for the development of Shanghai. I hereby translate it directly for the public to read.</p>
<p>The history of the British in Shanghai is the history of Shanghai. The British Navy did not receive the help of other countries in seizing the mouth of Wusong and advancing to the public concession area, crossing the Old Zha Bridge. At the same time, the British warships destroyed the Chinese Huangpu Battery. According to the Huangpu Battery, which is now the site of the British Consulate. The British army later went to Nanjing, and the Treaty of Nanjing and its appendices were signed in 1842 and 1843 respectively. These treaties stipulated the opening of Shanghai and four other places as trading ports. This was the beginning of extraterritoriality and the treaty port system.</p>
<p>Britain took the lead, bearing the brunt of the war, paying the war expenses, and setting a precedent. Other countries followed suit. When the smoke of the British guns cleared all obstacles in 1844, the people of other countries lived peacefully in the trading ports of Shanghai without firing a shot and enjoyed all special rights. The Shanghai concession was originally a ceded land owned by the British for twenty years. Then the French established another organization that suited their own needs. On the other hand, the British concession merged with the American concession on the north bank of the Suzhou River to form a public concession.</p>
<p>The first British consul in Shanghai was Colonel Balfour. The staff included translator Medhurst, doctor Hale, and secretary Stratham. Consul Balfour arrived in Shanghai on November 8, 1843. Six days later, he rented a Gu family house with a total of fifty-two rooms on Sanyao Road in Shanghai city and established the consulate there. At that time, other British people who came to Shanghai included Dr. Lockhart and his wife, and the sister of Sir Parker. She was the first Western woman to set foot in Shanghai and died in 1918 at the age of ninety-two. In December of the same year (referring to 1843), twenty-five British people were registered at the consulate, including Wise of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., Gibb of Dent &amp; Co., Smith of Dent &amp; Co., Beale, and Dalgleish of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. The first to formally lease land and build houses. The first map (referring to the land deed of the British Consulate) was for Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. The third map was for Dent &amp; Co. The fourth map was for Wise &amp; Co. The fifth map was for Wu Kaut and Betts. The eighth and ninth maps were for Dent &amp; Co. (Note: Wu Kaut was a British man and was the first British Consul in Shanghai)</p>
<p>In the first six weeks after Shanghai opened as a trading port, seven ships entered the Mansang warehouse. The largest was named Elizabeth Wal, with a weight of 423 tons. The smallest was named Guanreba, weighing 171 tons. The average tonnage of the seven ships was 281 tons. The value of imported goods was 433,720 yuan. The value of exports was 146,072 yuan. In addition to those who formally leased land and built houses, there were many other foreign businessmen, including British people, who gathered along the river outside Shanghai County, which is now the Nanshi. Many missionaries lived in the city. Initially, foreigners did not use the concession much as a place for business. It was not until the British Consulate moved from the city to its current location on July 21, 1849, that it changed greatly.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 13 Who Plants Fortune Unintentionally Gets Diamond Ring Only This Fate Has The Intention To Sing Golden Threads</p>
<p>Speaking of the family of Yi Yuanyuan, it can be regarded as a story of a Shanghai prostitute family. It turns out that Yi Yuanyuan's father was a cook, and he was also a master. In addition to contracting banquets for several wealthy merchants in Shanghai, he also opened a meal-wrapping business, which also had some savings. Unexpectedly, this Chef Chen was not only good at cooking, but also an engineer at a brick and tile company. He had two wives and a total of thirteen daughters. The ancients said that giving birth to a daughter was called playing with tiles. His two wives were all tile kilns. He was really a good brick and tile master. Although he was a cook, he had great ambitions. With some money, he wanted to expand his business. So he opened a restaurant. Everything in Shanghai was expensive, and all kinds of equipment had to be complete. Even a restaurant was not a small capital to run. Only the rent in Shanghai scared the people in the inland. All kinds of food stores had to blow the conch sufficiently and also had to be a little slippery. On the one hand, they properly asked someone to help them. Chef Chen was an honest man and opened an honest shop. In less than two years, he had almost exhausted all his savings and also lost several thousand yuan. He lost money opening a restaurant. The idea turned to the brick and tile company. At that time, his eldest daughter was already in the flower-like age, and the younger one was still in swaddling clothes. In the past, the person in charge of the restaurant business was very close to the brothels. For example, brothels used to install telephones without the brothels being named, but mostly with the restaurants being named as evidence. Chef Chen wanted to do business in the Tangzi, so his restaurant was also opened in the area where Qu Yuan gathered. Therefore, his several daughters were inevitably influenced by what they saw and heard and gradually became associated with gorgeous clothes and makeup and saw that although he was a cook, the daughters he gave birth to were all dressed in powder and jade and grew up with natural beauty and unusual romance, and one was better than the other, and the younger ones were more beautiful. The seventh was better than the sixth, and the ninth was more beautiful than the eighth. Counting to Yi Yuanyuan, she was already ranked tenth and was a talent who surpassed the sisters. The ancients said that slow hiding taught theft and slow color taught lasciviousness. With so many beautiful daughters, people said that Chef Chen had not gone bankrupt, even if one daughter was called a thousand gold, he had thirteen daughters, which was equivalent to thirteen thousand gold. So many people encouraged him to open a Tangzi, and some people arranged marriages for the older daughters, promising them to be concubines. In this way, not only were the debts cleared, but also several thousand yuan were added. Helplessly, his heart for opening a restaurant never died. The second time he opened a restaurant, the scale of the second restaurant was larger than the first time. It was another loss. He still had to find a way on several daughters. This Chef Chen really carried out the sentence of Wuxi scholar Wu Zhihui, the elder of the party and the country, saying that the mouth was wide and the debt was tight.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Financial Gold Crashes by Twenty Taels <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Selling Storm is Irresistible, Bullish Spirit Disappears</p>
<p>Those Who Get Out Rush Out. Yesterday, the 18th, the situation of the gold market was unusually weak, with a sharp decline of as much as twenty taels, which was caused by the large bullish accounts selling off one after another. There were twists and turns of more than eleven taels before and after the market, rising and falling suddenly. In a short period of time, there were two or three taels to five or six taels of fluctuations, and the market situation was deeply bizarre, with people being extremely panic-stricken. The storm was raging, and the bullish arrogance had been extinguished. As for the foreign exchange, it also declined. The market was still relatively busy, but the supply was always greater than the demand. Hengxingsheng, Dachengfeng, Yongxing and other treasures encouraged the market, while Yuanxing, Yongyifeng, Yongxing and others bought in. Although the large silver bar slightly increased, it was not moved by it. It seemed strong at the beginning, but later the sellers were brave and eager to go downstream. However, there was sometimes a hidden position, so it fluctuated around sixty taels. Until noon, it plummeted by more than ten taels, and the foreign exchange became more and more tired. Later, the selling intentions of Zhifeng Yongyu, Da Yongfeng and others revived, while the buyers were Taikang Runhengxing and others. The market was even weaker, and it suddenly broke through fifty taels, and finally fell to forty-two or three taels, with a trend of rivers flowing downward. The exchange rate was still loose, and the quoted price had suddenly been reduced to more than eighty taels. It was said to be huge. A dramatic change occurred in the off-term voices, which was unexpected. The large bar on the 17th averaged one-sixteenth of the silver price plus one-eighth.</p>
<p>At noon, the decline became more severe. The October gold price opened high, calculated as 564 taels and 8 qian, which was a gain of 1 tael and a hairy disc. There were more than 2 taels of ups and downs. Hengxingsheng Da sold, and Dadecheng Yuanmao Yong and others entered. After Mitsui ate 1 tael, 2 qian and 6 fen 75 of the current Dalian gold, it added it to 4 taels and 2 qian. When the announcement was first made, it returned to 2 taels and 3-4 qian. The listing price did not move, and the internal seemed to be withering. Mitsui bought the next month's Japanese gold for 1 tael, 2 qian and 6 fen 375. Zhengjin bought the November English gold for 7 pence and a half. The decline was due to the strong selling intention of Shengda and others, so it fell by 5-6 taels after 10 o'clock, with only 2-3 taels of highs and lows. At 10:30, it was 56 taels. Later, Korea bought Dalian gold for 1 tael, 2 qian, 5 fen and 75 for next month. Sumitomo issued 1 tael, 2 qian and 6 fen 875 for the near term, and Yuanxing Yong Yongfeng and others bought in, so the price jumped by 5-6 taels. After 11 o'clock, it was 62 taels. However, the sellers still encouraged their strength and reduced it by 6-7 taels. When the market closed at noon, it was only 54 taels and 5 qian, and it had already made a small 3 taels.</p>
<p>It closed at 544 taels in the evening. It fell to 52 taels and 2 qian when it opened in the afternoon, and then there were several cents of ups and downs in the afterglow of noon. Then, Hengxing re-entered, and it was pushed up to 4 taels and 2-3 qian. After 2:30, there were rumors that the Indian exchange rate had increased, so it had broken through 50 taels, calculated as 49 taels. From 3 to 4 o'clock, the market was dazed. In an instant, there were 3-4 taels of ups and downs, hovering within 50 taels, and the exchange rate was quite weak. Mackenzie and Shanghai did the October US dollar at 39 yuan 625. Korea bought Dalian gold for 1 tael, 2 qian, 4 fen and 375 in October. As for the forward English gold, the bank's buying price had to be 7 pence 6875. After 4 o'clock, Zhifeng Yongyu Dafuxing, Yong Shengda, and others had sales. Hengxing suddenly came out and suddenly entered. However, the market was still weak. A storm suddenly crashed by more than 9 taels, and the market was about to close at 42 taels and 5 qian. The shorts already had a glimmer of hope. It was unexpected. It closed at 4:30, calculated at 544 taels, a drop of 19 taels and 8 qian compared to the end of last week.</p>
<p>The quoted price finally pressed down 83 taels. The maximum price before and after the market was 65 taels and 3 qian, and the minimum price was 42 taels and 5 qian, a difference of 22 taels and 8 qian. The quoted price was still 627 taels, calculated as 65-66 taels to 72 taels. In the afternoon, it had already been pressed down to 74-75 taels to 83-84 taels, and the exchange had both morning and afternoon double closing prices. The morning price was 64 taels for August and September, and 55 taels for October. The afternoon price was 52 taels to 44 taels. The supplement was 64 taels, and the afternoon was 52 taels. The goods opened at 64 taels and 9 qian in the morning, 53 taels and 8 qian in the afternoon, and 52 taels and 3 qian in the afternoon. The market closed at 44 taels.</p>
<p>The Guangdong gang went out with more than 6-7,000 taels. According to the transactions of various firms, Yongcheng Changshunli Wanxing Yifeng Yuanxing Yong Yongfeng and others entered. Zhifeng Yongda Decheng Jiutai Senchang Yong Yu Da and others had uncertain ins and outs. Hengxingsheng Dachengfeng Yongyuan Maoyong Taifeng Chengchang Sheng Yong Jinan all sold. In the afternoon, Hengxing Yifeng Yongshunli Wanxing Taikang Run all entered. Yuanxing Yongyuan Mao had uncertain ins and outs.

<p>English Gold: Fell by 43.75; US Gold: Rose by 8.75; Japanese Gold: Dropped by 0.625</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange rates listed by HSBC showed no overall increase or decrease. In the interbank market, the British, American, and Japanese exchange rates initially remained stable. However, they gradually weakened, especially in the afternoon. This was mainly because the gold price was stable in the morning but fell in the afternoon, abruptly breaking through the 5,550 tael mark, showing a steep decline. The unexpected drop of more than 20 taels caused panic and confusion. As a result, the exchange rates of various currencies were stimulated. Compared to last Saturday, English gold was down by 43.75, US gold was up by 8.75, and the Japanese exchange rate plummeted by 0.625. Chinese speculators were still active, with over 100,000 pounds of English gold being sold. Banks such as Mercantile Bank, Yokohama Specie Bank, MacKenzie &amp; Co., HSBC, and Chinese banks absorbed these sales. Additionally, tens of thousands of pounds were traded between banks, along with several tens of thousands of US dollars. Several tens of thousands of Japanese yen were sold, with Mitsui, Taiwan Bank, and Bank of Chosen buying (Dalian banks were selling spot Dalian notes). Some settled for an amount of two to three hundred thousand. Sumitomo in Taiwan also sold. Market sentiment was weakening, and the market atmosphere became tighter.</p>

<p>Bond Prices Soar Continuously, Trading Suspended</p>
<p>Customs Tax, Reorganization, and Troop Reduction Bonds Were Suspended at the Beginning of the Morning, and Future Month Issues and Post-Settlement Issues Were Also Suspended in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to major developments in the political situation and positive sentiment, the bond market was very active, with strong buying and transactions. The bond market situation was extremely tense for a time. Customs Tax, Reorganization, Troop Reduction, and other issues for the current and future months all soared by as much as four yuan from the previous day's recorded prices at the beginning of the morning, leading to suspension of trading. Although other trends were flatter, they still rose significantly compared to the previous week. The buying and transactions in the afternoon market were extremely active. Post-Settlement, current and future month issues, and entire series six future month issues also rose by four yuan, leading to suspension of trading. Although formal trading of Customs Tax, Reorganization, Troop Reduction, and other issues had been suspended, brokers were still actively trading off-market, seeking supply, resulting in off-market prices rising by more than three yuan compared to the suspended morning prices. It is estimated that prices rose by as much as seven yuan in one day, a rare occurrence in recent years. It is expected that the prices of bonds such as Customs Tax, Reorganization, Troop Reduction, and other issues for this month will continue to be suspended. In addition, series six and Post-Settlement issues rose by about four yuan yesterday, and other issues also rose by around two yuan. It is estimated that only 8,000 yuan in spot transactions and over 11,300,000 yuan in futures transactions were completed for the entire day.</p>

<p>The Yarn Market Initially Fell, Then Turned Flat</p>
<p>The sharp decline in foreign yarn and cotton did not have a significant impact on the local market, mainly because of some short covering and tight buying in the near term.</p>
<p>The yarn market initially fell and then turned flat. However, the overseas cotton yarn market showed an even more drastic decline. The local market was not significantly affected because some took the opportunity to cover shorts, and buyers have remained tight-lipped in recent months, so the market situation was stable. Most believed that the autumn sales season had not yet passed, and good news about the political situation made buying sentiment stronger. However, a few large players saw the weakening of the global cotton industry and were deeply concerned about selling. Both longs and shorts had considerable support. The future of the yarn market depends on whether the current demand is strong or not.</p>
<p>Man-Made Yarn: The evening market slightly recovered. The morning market opened with the sharp drop in US cotton and the three grades followed suit. Market sentiment was weak, and large players like Xincheng sold more, with prices for each month falling by 0.05 to 0.12 taels. In the afternoon, it was heard that actual sales were slightly active, and the Guangdong group bought more, with prices for each month rising by 0.01 to 0.02 taels. The total transaction volume for the day was 20,900 bales. It was found that Taichang bought 1,900 bales, Tianlong 950 bales, Ruidai 1,200 bales, and Xiesheng 850 bales. Jichang, Hengyi, Hanfeng, Shenji, Yiyu, and Daji Guangfeng sold 350 to 550 bales each. Dafeng sold 2,800 bales, Xincheng 1,650 bales, Humei 1,000 bales, Yongfeng 850 bales, and Yu Dai Yi, Yu Kang, Gong Tai, and Mao Ji Yongchang Shengtail sold 250 to 700 bales each. The closing prices for man-made yarn are recorded below.</p>
<p>Man-Made Yarn Closing Price: Change, Open Interest</p>
<p>November: 15.66, Up 0.06, 323,008</p>
<p>August: 15.76, Down 0.05, 150,500</p>
<p>December: 15.62, 0.072, 20,200</p>
<p>September: 15.74, 0.01, 125,400</p>
<p>January: 15.63, 0.09, 880,000</p>
<p>October: 15.70, 0.04, 363,000</p>
<p>Spot Sales Show Some Signs of Life: Spot yarn sales are more active, but spot transactions are not smooth. It was found that various groups bought a total of 926 bales, Tianjin imported 500 bales of futures, the inland imported 655 bales of futures, and the trade imported 1,600 bales. The market was flat. The customer groups from Sichuan bought the most, accounting for 500 bales, Yunnan 36 bales, Luzhou imported 155 bales, Nanyang imported 55 bales, Jiangxi imported 75 bales, Shantou imported 20 bales, and miscellaneous groups imported 85 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e126">The Cotton Market Becomes More and More Unsupported <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>US Cotton Falls More Sharply, and Chinese Cotton Drops by 0.04 Taels</p>
<p>The US cotton price has been falling more fiercely, and the local cotton market has become more and more unsupported. Although the longs are adding to their positions to temporarily maintain the precarious situation, the US cotton selling pressure is also strong because the number of new cotton harvests is expected to increase significantly due to the sharp reduction in consumption. As for the spot cotton business, it is quite quiet, and the factories have no appetite at all because there is enough old cotton in stock. Judging from the situation of US cotton, the future is extremely pessimistic.</p>
<p>Chinese Cotton Falls Sharply and Slightly Recovers: The morning market opened with US cotton at a new low price from the previous day, and the sentiment was quite weak, with selling slightly stronger. Prices for each month fell by 0.025 to 0.05 taels. In the afternoon, retail investors were optimistic and prices rose by 0.005 to 0.01 taels. The total transaction volume was 64,200 loads. It was found that Yu Dai sold 3,700 loads, Shen Chang 2,600 loads, Mao Ji 5,400 loads, and Yu Dai, Daji, Tianlong, Sen Kang, Xing Yuan, Xie Sheng, Yongchang, Dafeng, Shenji, and Jinfeng sold 900 to 1,600 loads each.

<p>The Spot Cotton Business Remains Quiet: Spot cotton business is stagnant. All factories have temporarily stopped procurement, as they see that the new cotton is progressing smoothly and the autumn harvest is promising. The source of Yao cotton is estimated at 1,200 bales. The cargo list is recorded below:</p>
<p>Yao Cotton 34.25 to 35.04: A customer group imported 600 bales. Shanxi cotton was delivered to the warehouse at 34.50. Shenxin Factory imported 200 bales for delivery to the factory.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Observations on US Cotton Trends <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Production of 14 Million Bales is Sufficient for Consumption and More</p>
<p>This year's US cotton market has been weak due to the global cotton industry's decline, hovering between 0.15 and 0.16. Between March and June, the cooperative's price maintenance measures failed, and the market price quickly fell to 0.13. Subsequently, the government's new cotton estimate was only 27% lower than the previous season, making it impossible to reverse the declining market trend. Although the drought affected fertility, the poor trade in cotton goods and the government's cotton production report, along with ample supply, failed to attract buyers. Furthermore, the sharp reduction in sales and the disappearance of insect pests caused the market price to drop sharply again, breaking through the 0.12 mark, the lowest price since the 1926 bumper harvest. The future trend will depend on the production and consumption of new cotton.</p>
<p>The government's first cotton field estimate for this season is 45,815,000 acres, a decrease of 5.5% compared to the same period last year, a decrease of only 2.7% compared to the revised figure, a decrease of 24% compared to 1927, and a decrease of 6% compared to 1926. This estimate includes fields abandoned after planting due to special reasons. The difference between the first estimate and the revised acreage is the abandoned acreage. The amount of abandoned acreage this season is unknown, but based on the average of 3.5% for abandoned acreage between 1920 and 1929, the estimated harvested cotton acreage this year is about 44,211,000 acres. A comparison of cotton fields in various states and the average rate of abandoned acreage over ten years is listed above (unit: thousands of acres).</p>
<p>State: This Season, Last Season, Increase/Decrease, Percentage, 1920-1929 Average Cotton Field Abandonment Percentage</p>
<p>Virginia: 90, 89, 1, 0.120</p>
<p>North Carolina: 1724, 1916, -192, 0.016</p>

<p>Georgia: 3818, 3818, 0, 0.036</p>
<p>Florida: 106, 96, 10, 0.056</p>
<p>Mississippi: 3833, 4711, -878, 0.048</p>
<p>Tennessee: 1227, 1147, 80, 0.072</p>
<p>Alabama: 3652, 3727, -75, 0.017</p>
<p>Mississippi: 4314, 4229, 85, 0.026</p>
<p>Louisiana: 2071, 2135, -64, 0.028</p>
<p>Texas: 17500, 18229, -729, 0.038</p>
<p>Oklahoma: 4076, 4430, -354, 0.026</p>
<p>Arkansas: 4012, 3933, 79, 0.023</p>
<p>New Mexico: 133, 132, 1, 0.106</p>
<p>Arizona: 212, 227, -15, 0.016</p>
<p>California: 273, 319, -46, 0.027</p>
<p>Other States: 19, 19, 0, 0.046</p>
<p>Total: 45825, 47067, -1242, 0.035</p>
<p>The number of harvests is difficult to predict due to changes in the weather and the state of insect pests. Based on the harvested cotton acreage of 44,311,000 acres this year, the harvest is estimated to be about 13,652,000 bales based on the average harvest of 154.4 pounds per acre in the last ten years. Based on the average harvest of 163 pounds per acre in the last five years, the harvest is about 14,413,000 bales. The average production is about 14 million bales. In addition to reports of drought this year, losses from insect pests have been avoided. If there are no special circumstances in the future, a harvest of 13,652,000 bales can be regarded as the low end of cotton production this season. If the drought-stricken areas can get rain early and have suitable weather, the harvest of 14,413,000 bales can be expected.</p>
<p>Although a harvest of 14 million bales cannot be considered a bumper harvest, it can be regarded as an oversupply in the current trend of the global cotton industry's decline. Based on the current situation, it is impossible for the US cotton consumption this year to reach 14 million bales. The number of year-end inventories is likely to increase, approaching or even exceeding the 7,338,000 bales in 1927. Even if the global cotton industry can gradually turn around, the supply of over 14 million bales is sufficient, and the inventory of 6,340,000 bales cannot be eliminated. The trend of the cotton market will be difficult to recover for a while and will hover at a low peak (August 16).</p>

<h3 id="e129">The Grain and Rice Market Has Turned Stagnant <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sources from Zhabei were still scarce, but according to news from the producing areas, there was still inventory, so local buyers were watching. The shippers also recognized that the river storage was not abundant and reduced sales. Therefore, the northern japonica rice was stagnant, while the eastern new japonica rice that arrived gradually was still strongly supported by the factory groups, with prices still at 19.5 yuan. The source of thin paddy rice was very small, and the market was as before. The new guest rice tip traded slightly more, and the large board was about 15 yuan, with no change. The white yuan price did not rise or fall.</p>
<p>The amount of rice arriving in the Huning River was slightly insufficient, and the retail sales were slow. The price of each machine-processed japonica rice from Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Tongzhou, etc., fluctuated within a stagnant and stable situation. However, the price of inferior goods dropped slightly. The transaction of eastern new japonica rice here was slightly strong, and the price was also 19.5 yuan. The amount of southern thin paddy rice arriving on schedule was scarce, and all parties did not pay much attention to it. The market had no change. The white yuan was sometimes scarce and sometimes abundant, with high-quality goods priced at 19 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e130">It Is Difficult to Reverse the Declining Trend of Foreign Rice <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was still no hope of a turnaround for foreign rice. In the entire market, Dalian merchants took 200 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice. Local and township merchants took 2,000 bags of Saigon small and large broken rice, etc. Although there were inquiries about northern rice and local rice in the market, the numbers were not enough to reverse the declining trend. Inland and Yangtze merchants had been active in recent days but were not only stagnating and watching the market but also returning some of the rice they had stored, causing the market situation to be even more stagnant. Compared to the previous market, the market continued to drop by a small 0.02. The list shows: No. 1 Yaoan Gong rice, 400 bags, priced at 16.56 yuan; No. 2, 200 bags, priced at 14.46 yuan; small broken rice, 500 bags, priced at 15 yuan; large broken rice, 300 bags, priced at 12.7 yuan; Cover Rice, 600 bags, priced at 14.7 to 14.4 yuan, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e131">The Flour Market is Firm in the Near Term and Loose in the Long Term <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market fell slightly after opening in the morning because the quoted price of foreign wheat fell by 0.05 or 0.06 yuan. As a result, the morale of people inside and outside the industry was weak. However, because the factories still held onto the current month's prices and refused to loosen, the prices for each month recovered. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the price for the current month was slightly firmer as it fluctuated. After October, the domestic groups returned their inventory, and the factories stood by, allowing the prices to rise and fall, so the market became tired again. It was observed that the factories seemed to be waiting quietly for the sales market to sell at a good price. Otherwise, this situation can be expected to stagnate. As a result, the current month and September were slightly firmer by 0.025, October was slightly firmer by 0.005, November and December were slightly firmer by 0.0075, and January was slightly firmer by 0.01.</p>
<h3 id="e132">The Wheat Futures Market Revived in the Afternoon <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was generally sluggish after opening in the morning. The market price of foreign wheat fell slightly, so buying sentiment naturally weakened. The price for each month was generally 0.03 or 0.04 lower than the previous week's closing price. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the flour market had stabilized, and local traders took a few positions, so the price for the current month recovered strongly. The prospects for the current wheat market require that transportation in each producing area be unimpeded and cargo transportation be smooth before there can be greater inflows and outflows. As a result, the current month was slightly better by 0.039, October was unchanged, November was better by 0.01, December was unchanged, and January was slightly lower by 0.02. The current wheat market is stable, with small and medium-sized factories having an appetite. The quoted prices for Shandong special high-quality white wheat opened at more than 5.2 taels, and the quoted prices for wheat from Tai'erzhuang, Chuzhou, Yaowan, Qingjiangpu, Zhujizhen, Shashi, Yangzhou, Hankou, and Huangqiao were roughly the same. A total of more than 9,000 bags were taken by Fufeng and Huafeng, etc.</p>

<p>After the price of new fresh pork fell by more than 10 taels in the second round, the current price has fallen again by another 0.01 or 0.02. For example, the price that opened at 31.2 taels was less than 30 taels yesterday. Calculated according to the land price, each dan must lose 0.05 or 0.06 taels. The supply exceeds the demand, so the market price is getting worse, almost dropping sharply. This is the only example in recent years.</p>

The arrival of Gang Electric sago is gradually increasing, and the prices of each grade have fallen by 0.03 to 0.05. Ningbo News: Due to the lack of customer demand, the inventory of new dried shrimp and shellfish has not changed. The market price has fallen day by day. The current sale price of high-quality goods is 33 to 34 yuan. A letter from Hakodate says that kelp and laver seaweed are selling very well in Japan, and the market price has soared by about 30 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the supply at Nan Tou Xi Road was scarce. There were boats accumulated in the Pu River, with the "Xian Zi Gang" and "Tong Bei Gang" gangs together having about five "tong", estimated at around 1,000 "shi".

<h3 id="e149">Jin Li Yuan Wharf Case <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the negotiation reached a satisfactory conclusion. The judicial authorities were prevented from executing the order, the lease agreement was maintained, and arbitration was initiated immediately.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock, Cai Pei, the director of the China Merchants Bureau, together with Liu Yunfang, the deputy director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office, and Gao Shuo, the legal advisor of the bureau, went to the French Consulate to meet with the French Consul-General Ganggelin to discuss and resolve the Jin Li Yuan Wharf dispute. The talks between the two sides lasted about an hour, and a very satisfactory result was achieved. The French Consul has made a clear statement regarding the resolution of this case. The main points of the discussion between the two sides are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Director Cai's Statement: I am very grateful to Your Consul-General for sincerely mediating this matter based on diplomatic relations. However, the approximate key points of this case that should be clarified are: (1) The land evidence filled in by the Bureau (official document from Shanghai County to the Ministry of Revenue on February 6th of the Guangxu era requesting the issuance of a license). (2) Shanghai Daotai Gong Zhaoyu's correspondence with the French Consul-General De stating that the land must be leased to the China Merchants Bureau (Shanghai Daotai's letter to the French Consul on August 29th of the Guangxu era). (3) The French Consul-General De's reply to the Shanghai Daotai stating that the original land would be leased to the China Merchants Bureau for use (letter from the French Consul to the Shanghai Daotai on January 19th of the Guangxu era). (4) When issuing the deed to Sandetang, a condition was attached that the French Consul should order it to be leased to the China Merchants Bureau for use as currently discussed (official document from the Shanghai Daotai to the China Merchants Bureau on December 20th of the Guangxu era). (5) Clause 11 of the contract signed by both parties on December 4th, 1916 states that if there is any dispute regarding the interpretation and implementation of this contract, it should be submitted to arbitration. Sandetang's rash lawsuit this time violates the provisions of the contract. (6) Restriction on land price: Clause 2 of the original contract states that the valuation during the first 25 years of this lease shall not exceed 300,000 taels, and shall not exceed 350,000 taels during the subsequent 25 years, but in any case, it shall not be lower than 240,000 taels. Our Bureau will consider the reason and situation and will never let them suffer losses. The number can be arbitrated by the arbitrator, but it must be bound by the original contract. Our Bureau has also appointed lawyer Gao Shuo as the arbitrator for this matter. Please inform Sandetang to start the arbitration immediately and ask Your Consul to express your opinion.</p>
<p>The French Consul's Statement: Director Liu has repeatedly explained the points raised by Director Cai to the French Consul and marked them down. According to the French Consul's reply, according to Article 10 of the contract, if the rent is in arrears, the lease can be canceled, but it does not state that the China Merchants Bureau will not be able to enjoy the Jin Li Yuan Wharf after the lease is canceled. These are two completely different matters. Because Sandetang is purely a church organization, the only purpose of its priests renting land is to obtain rent on time. If there is an arrear, the contract can be cancelled. As for what your bureau claims, according to the lease regulations, if there is any dispute, it can be submitted to arbitration. Sandetang has now prepared arbitrators, but the China Merchants Bureau has not yet appointed arbitrators to negotiate with Sandetang, which has led to legal proceedings. Now that the Director of the China Merchants Bureau has agreed to appoint arbitrators to negotiate with the representatives of Sandetang to resolve all problems, the legal aspect will naturally not be a problem. The French Consul-General also said that regarding the execution of the cancellation of the lease by the French Public Concession Court, the original hearing was scheduled to continue on Tuesday (i.e., today). Whether to execute it, this Consul-General will be responsible for delaying the execution of the judgment to seek a peaceful solution and will be responsible for notifying Sandetang to prepare to open negotiations with the China Merchants Bureau to resolve the dispute. As for what your Director said, the only purpose now is to continue to maintain the lease between the two parties and appropriately increase the annual rent. This Consul-General can guarantee that it can be handled accordingly. But there is one point that needs to be stated urgently, that is, regarding what your Director said, the annual rent can be increased appropriately, but it cannot be increased beyond the contract. This Consul-General can reply on behalf of the priests that it can always be discussed. However, ensuring that the annual rent is paid on time is the most important key. A practical guarantee should be given by the arbitrator of the China Merchants Bureau and the arbitrator of Sandetang. Please note that the French Consul-General finally stated that the negotiations this afternoon have made great progress and are gratifying. Director Cai and others stated that the negotiation results were satisfactory, and they shook hands and said goodbye.</p>
<p>Meeting of the French Municipal Council Yesterday afternoon at half past five, the board of directors of the French Municipal Council held a meeting. Chinese directors Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuehe, and Huang Jinrong all attended. During the meeting, all the directors requested French Consul-General Ke Ge Lin to report on the results of the meeting with Cai Pei, the director of the China Merchants Bureau. The French Consul reported in detail. All the directors expressed their satisfaction with the French Consul's measures to prevent the execution by the French Public Concession Court and to initiate arbitration. The meeting adjourned at about seven o'clock.</p>
<p>Director Cai's Remarks: Director Cai told reporters that the reason why he came to Shanghai twice from Beijing to assume the responsibility of acting as the director of the Bureau was that he deeply understood that the China Merchants Bureau's lawsuit in the Sandetang lease dispute had failed. Only six days remained before the cancellation of the lease would be executed when he came to Shanghai to continue acting as the director. If the China Merchants Bureau's Jin Li Yuan Wharf was divided and suffered a significant loss in property value, and if it was impossible to connect the wharves, it would be greatly related to sovereignty. Therefore, he resolutely came back because the situation was urgent and allowed no delay. He relied heavily on Gao Shuo in handling this matter. Now he has stated to the French Consul that the original contract will still be leased to the China Merchants Bureau for continued use, but considering the current land price, the rent should also be increased appropriately. The result of the negotiation with the French Consul this time is to fundamentally revoke the two lawsuits (because the third appeal must be made to Paris). It is only possible to abandon the law and speak of the facts. Under the restrictions of the contract, each party will appoint arbitrators to appropriately increase the rent. This matter will be implemented soon. In this wharf lease dispute case, the Bureau can still be considered to have prevailed. The reporter also asked whether the new director Chen Xizeng will come to take over immediately. Cai said that the clear order has been seen and he can certainly come to take over.</p>

<p>Planned to Visit Chairman Chiang at the Front Line for Instructions</p>
<p>Chen Xizeng, the new director of the China Merchants Bureau, has formally received an order from the National Government and is scheduled to go to Nanjing today to contact various parties regarding the funding issues of the China Merchants Bureau. Also, because the government owes a large amount of ship rental fees, he also plans to settle accounts with the Ministry of Finance. Mr. Chen plans to visit Chairman Chiang at the front line to ask for instructions on everything after the funding is secured before returning to Shanghai to take office. Yesterday, Cai Pei, the outgoing director, specially sent Li Guifan, the manager of the four wharves, to welcome the new director to the Bureau for inspection.</p>

<p>Negotiated the Aftermath of the Changsha Incident and Presented the Japanese Side's List of Damages</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for office work at around 10 o'clock yesterday morning. Guests visiting him included Mei Lehe, the Commissioner of Customs, Song Ziliang, Jin Wensi, the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Chongguang Kui, the Finnish Chargé d'Affaires Wei Meiji, and others. Chongguang was negotiating the aftermath of the Changsha Incident and presented the Japanese side's list of damages suffered by Japanese residents in Changsha in person. The meeting lasted for an hour before he left. According to Wang's statement to our reporter, regarding the Changsha Incident, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent Zhou Zechun to investigate the details. The negotiation strategy will be decided after he reports back. It is not possible to express anything to the other party at this time, etc. Wang was originally scheduled to return to Nanjing yesterday, but he has some important public affairs to negotiate in Shanghai, so he has to stay a little longer.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Total Revenue of the Municipal Council in the First Half of This Year <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Six Million Sixty-Nine Thousand One Hundred and Seventeen Taels</p>
<p>The North China Daily News says that the progressive development of the Public Concession can be seen in the number of revenues released by the Municipal Council. The total revenue for the first half of this year was 6,069,117 taels, while the same period last year was only 5,703,167 taels. Although there was 6,830,552 taels in the year before last, there was a payment of 1.5 million taels for electrical contracts, which is still less than last year and this year after deducting this item. Among them, the largest increase was in patrol fees. In the first half of this year, Westerners paid a total of 1,329,019 taels, compared to 1,200,894 taels last year and only 1,107,441 taels the year before last. Westerners paid a total of 151,345 taels in special fees, compared to only 142,059 taels last year. Chinese paid a total of 1,583,796 taels in patrol fees, compared to 1,478,347 taels in the same period last year. However, the number of Chinese special fees was slightly reduced because some Chinese residences on both sides of the cross-border roads have been changed to pay total fees to the municipal finance bureau. In total, the patrol fee item increased by more than 242,000 taels in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year. However, given the recent prosperity of construction in the concession, this increase is not surprising. In addition, land tax increased by more than 14,000 taels. Fees for foreign theaters and Chinese theaters each increased by 1,000 taels. Other entertainment venues also jumped from 4,993 taels to 7,049 taels. The registration fee for brothels even increased from 31,047 taels to 34,037 taels. However, the registration fee for hotels decreased from 23,271 taels to 21,918 taels, and the registration fee for foreign liquor stores also decreased by 450 taels, indicating the depression of the two industries. On the contrary, the pawn industry is thriving, and its registration fee has increased from 27,103 taels to 35,483 taels, resulting in an increase of more than 8,000 taels in municipal revenue. From these two points, we can see the decline of people's livelihood and the increase of the poor. The income from the registration fees of tobacco shops, small money shops, silver buildings, lighters, and small boats is similar to that of last year. As for transportation tools, the registration fees for automobiles and automobile rooms increased by more than 50,000 taels. Although there are many freight cars, the number of taxis has not only not decreased but also increased. The registration fee also increased by 2,439 taels in the first half of the year. The registration fee for private chartered cars increased by more than 5,000 taels, and the number of rickshaws also increased by several hundred, while the number of small carts slightly decreased. In addition, wharf fees have always been a major source of income, and they have increased year by year. The first half of 1928 was 269,545 taels, last year was</p>

<p>The preparatory office for the Ministry of Communications' International Radio Station, located at 152 Xinzha Road in this city, is constructing a large radio transmitting and receiving station in Zhenru and Liuhang, which is nearing completion. It is expected to officially commence communication by the end of October. This newspaper has repeatedly reported on this. Now, we have learned that Dr. Wen Yuqing, the director of the preparatory office, recognizing the importance of independent international communication sovereignty, has urged his staff to work day and night to complete all buildings, roads, and Sino-American, Sino-French, and Sino-German receiving antennas as soon as possible. The equipment at the Liuhang receiving station has also been installed and is currently being used to install the equipment at the Zhenru transmitting station and the antenna masts. Once completed, trial broadcasts will commence immediately.</p>

<p>Social Affairs Bureau Selling at Even Lower Prices</p>
<p>The first batch of 1,500 tons of Xian rice purchased from abroad by the Shanghai Rice Market Regulation Committee arrived in Shanghai long ago. Because the chairman of the committee, Mr. Yu Qiaqing, returned to Ningbo, the rice was temporarily stored in a Japanese merchant's warehouse and has not yet been sold. Mr. Yu returned to Shanghai yesterday and entrusted Mr. Lu Wenzhao to contact fifty rice shops, including Lu Zhonghe, to sell the rice at a price of 15 yuan per picul. The Social Affairs Bureau is selling it for only 13 yuan per picul. Sales are expected to begin within days. It is said that a second batch of foreign Xian rice will arrive within two weeks.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Issue of Bank Rice Mortgage Loans <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Bank Association Claims Not to Have Provided Them; Money Shops Association Yet to Respond</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau previously received reports that various banks and money shops in the city were providing rice mortgage loans totaling 20 million yuan. At the time, the rice market was tense, and there was concern that unscrupulous merchants might use this financial activity to hoard and speculate. The Bureau sent separate letters to the Bank and Money Shops Associations, asking them to investigate the loan situation and amounts undertaken by their member banks and money shops, as well as the locations where the rice was stored, in order to investigate and request that future loans be made for short terms and not be allowed to be rolled over, in order to remedy the situation. A month has passed, and the Money Shops Association has not yet responded. However, the Bank Association replied that, according to the responses from the various banks, they have not undertaken any rice mortgage loans. However, there are rumors that many rice mortgage loans are supporting hoarders. It is unknown whether the banks' responses are accurate.</p>
<h3 id="e160">City Social Affairs Bureau to Burn Rice Stem Borer Eggs and Moths Today <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Over 800,000 Egg Masses and Over 40,000 Moths; City Could Increase Rice Harvest by Over 4,000 Dan</p>
<p>In view of the increasing damage caused by rice stem borers in recent years, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to encourage farmers to search and capture them, applied to the Municipal Government for an appropriation to purchase them at five locations: Yinhang, Jiangwan, Wusong, Caojing, and the Pudong Municipal Agricultural Experiment Field. The situation regarding these purchases was reported in the previous issue. It is now heard that from July 1st to the 16th of this month, the Bureau has received over 800,000 rice stem borer egg masses and over 40,000 rice stem borer moths. It is said that each egg mass averages over one hundred worms, which can harm over one hundred rice plants. Each plant can produce one hundred grains of rice, so removing one egg mass can increase the grain yield by half a catty. Based on 800,000 egg masses, the city can increase its rice harvest by over 400,000 catties, or over 40 dan, equivalent to over 2,000 piculs of white rice. And the rice stem borer moths have not yet been counted. The cost is small, but the effect is great. The Bureau has determined that the rice stem borer eggs and moths are either about to hatch or have already decayed, so they will be burned today (the 19th) at 2:00 PM. The Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government have been informed and will send personnel to monitor the burning. All district municipal committee members, etc., have been ordered to attend at that time, and representatives from all sectors are expected to attend and observe.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Request to Extend Deadline for Reorganization of Trade Associations <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Proposed Extension Until January 1931</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau states that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted that the deadline for reorganization as stipulated by the Trade Association Law is one year from the promulgation of the law. However, although the Trade Association Law was promulgated on July 17, 1929, the implementing regulations were not issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce until January of this year. The period for the reorganization of these associations is proposed to be calculated as one year from the issuance of the implementing regulations, extending it to January 1931. The Social Affairs Bureau has telegraphed the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for instructions based on the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Issue of Shop Employees Joining Trade Associations <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>New Sound Society: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday reported that the shop employees of medicinal material stores legally joined trade associations, but were interfered with by the Medicinal Material Trade Union. They have requested the Citizens Training Committee and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to correct the situation. In addition to stating the facts, the original report also stated: "The Central Executive Committee instructed the Party Headquarters of each province on February 10 of this year that 'shop employees have also been decided by this committee to be included in the implementing regulations of the Trade Association Law, so that they have the opportunity to serve as member representatives. Once the organization is unified, the past divisions between large and small merchants, as well as disputes between shop owners and shop employees, can be fundamentally eliminated.' Therefore, the method stipulated in Article 8 of the Implementing Regulations of the Trade Association Law, which allows one additional representative for those employing more than fifteen people, is in accordance with the principles established by the Central Executive Committee. How can the trade union, under the protection of Party rule, wantonly obstruct this? As for the scope of commercial employers, Article 10 of the Implementing Regulations of the Chamber of Commerce Law clearly states that it is limited to managers, partners, and those who directly labor in the business. If students and machine operators are also serving in the business, they should also be included as commercial employers. Furthermore, Article 8 of the Implementing Regulations of the Trade Association Law revised the regulations to state that each company or firm may add one representative if it employs more than fifteen people. According to data, Tongkang Firm employs sixteen people, and the manager, representing the firm, has the right to add representatives according to law. However, the trade union forced Du Xianqing, the manager of Tongkang Firm, to admit that it was illegal. The supervisory committee does not know what laws it is based on. As for the claim that Zhang Qinzhang joined the trade association without going through legal procedures, it is also incomprehensible. According to current practice, what is formulated by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government is called law. The 'legal procedures' referred to by the trade union seem to require that commercial employers undergo a certain restriction when serving as member representatives of the trade association. This kind of restriction has not been promulgated by the National Government as a law. The 'legal procedures' referred to by the trade union should refer to some kind of restriction that the trade union has set itself. Not only can it not abuse the word 'legal,' but also, if the rules and resolutions set by the country's own body conflict with national laws, then these rules and resolutions are invalid. It is now found that when commercial employers join trade associations, there is no restriction attached to it by the laws set by the central government that they must first be approved or agreed to by the trade union. Therefore, whatever procedures the trade union sets are beyond its authority and vainly attempt to impose a kind of constraint on the central government's laws. According to the principles of law, it naturally does not take effect. If the trade union is allowed to create obstacles at will in this matter, then the instruction of the Central Executive Committee on February 10 will be fundamentally overturned. This concerns Party discipline and national credibility and is difficult to understand. The central government promulgated this decree precisely to reconcile the divisions between shop owners and shop employees, but the trade union is afraid that these divisions will be eliminated and is trying its best to create this kind of obstacle. It is impossible to guess what its intentions are, but it cannot but be considered to contain a significant meaning. According to the letter, it is reasonable to request your council to examine and verify this situation and to quickly stop the trade union's actions in accordance with the law, so that the central government's laws will not be arbitrarily destroyed by the trade union. It is difficult to express our public sentiment."</p>
<h3 id="e163">Ma Wenhuei's Discussion of the Recent Situation of Overseas Chinese in England <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The Kuo Wen News Agency reports that Mr. Ma Wenhuei, the European manager of Sincere Company and president of the London Chinese Chamber of Commerce and former president of the British Overseas Chinese Federation, recently returned to China from England with his wife and three-year-old son, Jian Yuan, and arrived in Shanghai. Because Ma had been stationed in England for a long time and his position was extremely important, the reporter visited him at his residence to ask about the recent situation of overseas Chinese in England. Mr. Ma was humble and sincere and could speak pure Mandarin (the following are Mr. Ma's own words): "I left Shanghai for England five days before the May 30th Massacre. At that time, I knew that the situation of the massacre was very painful. After arriving in England, I tried my best to publicize the matter of the massacre and gained the sympathy of the British people for China. Later, unfortunately, the Sha Ji, Wan County, and Jinan massacres followed one after another. The overseas Chinese were moved by righteousness and generously donated money, raising a total of more than 12,000 pounds to be remitted back to the motherland to help the victims. Although this was a drop in the bucket, it could still alleviate the urgent needs. After the various massacres, a certain country focused on one-sided publicity in the newspapers. The country's publicity in foreign countries was almost impossible to talk about because there was no equivalent publicity agency to counter it. Therefore, in every international negotiation, it was difficult for the various countries to sympathize with our country. This is truly a painful thing. Even a privately organized news agency is nowhere to be found, and the government agencies' publicity is difficult to attract foreign aid. Currently, the total number of overseas Chinese in the United Kingdom is only over 2,000, including 250 students. Their economic strength has not made great progress. My long-standing aspiration has been to strive for the development of the lives and the consolidation of the status of overseas Chinese. This is not only the happiness of our overseas Chinese, but also the glory of our Party and country. Unfortunately, in recent years, the number of unemployed people in the United Kingdom has increased sharply. According to current statistics, it has reached over two million. For example, the employee vacancies in my Sincere Company must first be filled by recruiting in the United Kingdom. Only if it is impossible to do so can we recruit from China to go to the United Kingdom. Although the British Labor Department's immigration law does not prohibit overseas Chinese from entering the country, the above method has imposed an invisible restriction on overseas Chinese businessmen and workers in the United Kingdom. As for Chinese banks in the United Kingdom, there is only the Bank of China branch newly established in London. It can be called the firstborn of Chinese banks abroad and can directly do business with various manufacturers. Our country's German government bonds are completely handled by it. It is also very convenient for overseas Chinese in the United Kingdom. It has only been open for a few months, but the total business volume has reached four to five million pounds. The future is bright. It is hoped that the domestic war will end soon so as not to directly or indirectly affect foreigners' attitudes toward our China. It seems that foreigners' attitude toward China has become relatively friendly. Although both sides had resentment after the May 30th Massacre, in recent years, most British people have been able to show considerable respect to Chinese people. This is really due to the self-improvement efforts of our compatriots." Mr. Ma is the son of Mr. Ma Yingbiao, the founder of Sincere Company. This trip is to return to Guangdong Province to visit relatives. It is heard that friends in the United Kingdom still hope that he will continue to go to the United Kingdom after his holiday to seek the development of the economic lives of overseas Chinese. At the same time, the headquarters of Sincere Company in Hong Kong has also telegraphed Ma to discuss important matters. I am afraid that his whereabouts will not be easy to determine for a while. Currently, Mr. Ma is temporarily residing at Mr. Guo Shun's residence on Jing'an Temple Road, Hartong Road, in this city, lingering for a while. He plans to return to Hong Kong first in the next few days.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Japan's Trade with China Booming Last Month <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>More than Double That of June</p>
<p>According to statistics released yesterday by the commercial office of the Japanese Embassy, the total value of Japan's trade with China in July (i.e., the total number of Japanese goods shipped to China) was 35,900,900 yen. This number has more than doubled compared to Japan's trade with China in June, which is quite unexpected. The reason is nothing more than that the internal war in China has reduced productivity, and at the same time, the price of gold has soared, and imports of European and American goods have plummeted, so the sales of Japanese goods have become very prosperous.</p>

<p>The first batch of Japanese dry cocoons, weighing a total of 240,000 pounds, packed in more than 2,000 bales, was shipped from Nagasaki to Shanghai yesterday by the Chunyang Fan mail ship. After import, the factories will pick them up from the customs warehouse in batches for use. It is scheduled that the second batch will be shipped to Shanghai next Monday. After that, one batch will be shipped every seven days, and all 10,000 bales will be completely shipped to Shanghai within one month.</p>

<p>More than a dozen Chinese silk factories in Hongkou and Zhabei that had been closed for many days due to labor disputes have gradually resumed work since the day before yesterday after the municipal party and government agencies sent personnel to mediate and the two sides reached a compromise. Male and female workers have successively entered the factories to work. As of yesterday, all three thousand and several hundred male and female workers in the factories have fully resumed work and returned to normal.</p>

<p>One Addressed to Chinese Director Du Yuesheng, the Other to the General Manager Requesting Remuneration</p>
<p>After the labor unrest at the French Water and Electricity Company was declared resolved, although the old workers have resumed work, the new workers temporarily hired by the company are still being actively maintained by Chinese Director Du Yuesheng. Now it has been completely resolved. All the new workers have voluntarily resigned, and Mr. Du has personally given them a bonus. The new workers are grateful and sent a letter to Mr. Du yesterday to express their gratitude. At the same time, they sent a letter to the general manager of the company requesting that they be given appropriate remuneration. The original text of the two letters is recorded below:</p>
<p>[T13]One[/T] Letter to Mr. Du Yuesheng: Respectfully, Mr. Du Yuesheng, Chinese Director. The representatives of the new workers are all grateful for your strong assistance and mediation. We are deeply moved by your great righteousness and generosity in adding a bonus. Our representatives and all workers are unable to repay you. In addition to publishing a thank you in the Shen and Xin newspapers, we also send a special letter of thanks. We wish you peace. Temporary representatives: He Yuyuan, Cai Runnan, Wang Dongfu, Chen Linquan, etc., leading all workers to express their gratitude. [T13]One[/T] Letter to the Company's General Manager: We, the new workers, worked at your company during the old workers' strike. Since the old workers have already resumed work at your company, we, the new workers, are submitting our resignation letter and requesting that we be paid appropriate remuneration. We request that the General Manager of the French Water and Electricity Company take note. Temporary representatives, leading all workers.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Record of Yesterday's Meeting of the Families of the Xin Daming Incident <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Discussing Japanese Compensation, the Public Endured the Pain to Acknowledge It</p>
<p>Three years have passed since the Xin Daming Wheel tragedy occurred. Yesterday afternoon, because the county case was not settled, the families of the victims held a special meeting to discuss whether to approve the amount of compensation offered by the Japanese side and how to distribute the compensation after it is received. At that time, more than fifty family members attended and publicly elected Chief Representative Pei Jiesan as chairman. Pei reported that since this case occurred three years ago, the families of the victims, for the sake of national rights, people's lives, and the future development of China's shipping industry, have spared no effort to sacrifice their lives, money, and spirit to fight against Japanese imperialism and capitalism. However, the difficulties of the victims' families over the past three years cannot be described in words. Fortunately, thanks to the righteous and courageous efforts of former lawyer Wu, now lawyer Wu, and assistant Jia Yaoxi, they have done their best to handle the matter and have repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side and appealed to various circles, which have been able to promote the Japanese side's understanding. Today, they are willing to pay 25,000 yen as compensation to all the families. At that time, our side did not approve it. Now, because the price of gold has risen to about 45,000 Chinese silver dollars, it has been approved by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and other organizations. Our victim's families have been forced to endure the pain to acknowledge it. However, how should all future receipt and disposal issues be handled? Please make a public decision. At that time, representatives of each family member put forward eleven suggestions, which were submitted to a vote by the chairman one by one and passed. The resolution methods were handed over to lawyer Wu Chengyu for implementation. Everyone agreed and adjourned the meeting. Therefore, the Xin Daming tragedy is expected to be resolved soon.</p>

<p>Huashe in Shaoxing is a place where silk is produced. Each year, a large amount of silk fabrics are produced and sold at home and abroad, amounting to tens of millions of dollars. The production of these silk fabrics is first woven by weaving mills and then handed over to silk merchants for procurement. They are then handed over to refining mills for dyeing and refining, and then resold to major silk merchants in Shanghai, who distribute them to various merchants for sale at home and abroad. However, because the prices of all goods have been expensive recently, the profit margin for the refining price has always been very thin, so each refining mill has often suffered losses. The Huashe Refining Industry Association previously sent representatives to Shanghai to request the Shen Qianjiang Silk Industry Association to fulfill the agreement to increase the refining price. The Shanghai merchants had already verbally agreed. Unexpectedly, the Huashe silk merchants still did not allow it, so the refining mills have all stopped operating and working. Merchants in Shanghai believe that the impact on the autumn fabrics listing is quite large and have written to merchants in Shaoxing to explain.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Buli Duo Launches the First Sound <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Jiufu Company in this city has created a new medicine called Buli Duo, divided into two types: Pure Jing Buli Duo and Han Ji Guai Buli Duo. It is said that its main component is the essence extracted from sea turtle liver oil, called Zhaju Er. The procedure for refining Zhaju Er is very difficult. Only a small amount of Zhaju Er can be extracted from every hundred pounds of fish liver oil, so it is also extremely valuable. In order to refine Zhaju Er, the company spent more than 100,000 gold yuan to install the latest equipment to succeed. It is also equipped with guiding, invigorating, and various tonic agents to make Pure Jing Buli Duo and Han Ji Guai Buli Duo. The manufacturing method and raw materials are exactly the same as those of popular imported products on the market. The original formula for this imported product has long been published, but all domestic pharmacies that want to manufacture according to the formula lack the economic and human resources. Now, Jiufu Company has succeeded in manufacturing it regardless of the cost. This also shows the progress of China's chemical pharmaceutical industry. It is also heard that because Buli Duo has been newly launched, it has been widely used by the medical and pharmaceutical communities. The sales channels of imported products have been greatly affected. Currently, due to limited production, it has not been able to publish large-scale promotions in newspapers. It will not be widely publicized until a large amount is produced. It is heard that domestic goods organizations in this city have introduced it to the people of the country. In the future, it will add a lot of color to the future of domestic goods.</p>

<p>The Pui Yik Society in South Shanghai rebuilt a five-story building last year, costing about 100,000 yuan. The interior is purely equipped with the latest scientific equipment and is quite perfect. It has now hired Jin Wuzhou, a PhD in Philosophy from Harvard University Graduate School in the United States, as the general manager and director of the student department, Tang Renxi, the former general manager of the Shanghai YMCA, as the director of the men's department, and Zhu Wanghuanqing, the former director of the Hangzhou YWCA, as the director of the women's department. They are currently planning and carrying out work. It is heard that in addition to improving the original business, the new society will open men's and women's bathhouses with a rainy shower room and expand the medical department and gymnasium to promote public health. A portion of the funds will be used for spiritual work and for work among the common people. A kindergarten is attached and is still being managed by specialized personnel. The new society's building can be opened around the end of September.</p>

<h3 id="e176">News from Various Labor Unions <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Cotton Mill Industry: Federation of Trade Unions, Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Cotton Mill Workers' Union - Letter to the workers of Chinese cotton mills: Dear workers, cotton textiles occupy the most needed and valuable position in the world. China, as an agricultural country, is naturally the richest country in terms of raw materials for cotton textiles. Considering its production status, it should be able to meet its own needs with surplus to supplement other countries. However, examining the facts, it is contrary to the principle of production. Which compatriot is not surprised, heartbroken, and unable to understand the reason? There are many reasons for the overall failure of China's cotton mill industry. Here, we select a few major points to tell our cotton mill workers: [T13]1[/T] Tariff rights are controlled by foreigners. In the past, China's cotton textile market was quite smooth, and business was very prosperous. This was because it was still closed off, with no competition from foreign merchants. Cotton mills were only established by Chinese people, and there were no foreign cotton mills established in China. Therefore, nineteen out of ten Chinese clothing materials were taken from domestic cotton textiles, and the supply was often insufficient to meet demand. The state of its prosperous business can be known. Since the failure of diplomacy in the late Qing Dynasty and the permission of trade, foreigners have transported all kinds of woolen, silk, and cotton goods to China. Tariff rights are controlled by foreigners, and import duties are extremely low, and there are even situations of tax evasion. These goods are all made by machines, and the products are sudden, the cost is small, the tax rate is light, and the price is cheap. Our machines are undeveloped.</p>
<p>Competing with it urgently leads to business decline, increased unemployment, and increased social panic. Both labor and capital suffer great losses. The control of tariff rights by foreigners is indeed the greatest fatal injury to China. [T13]2[/T] Chinese labor and capital failed to cooperate. Although the positions of capitalists and workers are different, their goals of seeking business development and common interests are the same. Therefore, capitalists and workers must have a spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation to expect business development. A good boat sails in the sea and encounters storms. Safety and danger are difficult to determine. At that time, there is no distinction between the crew and passengers in the boat. The lives of the entire boat are entrusted to one boat. Therefore, the crew and passengers are in different positions, but their main purpose is to seek safety. If a boat sinks to the bottom of the water, the crew and passengers will inevitably suffer the same fate. Is there any reason why the crew is lucky and the passengers are unlucky, or the passengers are lucky and the crew is unlucky? The capitalist is compared to the passenger, and the worker is compared to the crew. It is clear that the cooperation of capital and labor is necessary. However, today's Chinese capitalists mostly pride themselves on money and power, only knowing how to demand internally and not knowing how to develop externally, leading to unfortunate incidents. Thinking of this is really heartbreaking. [T13]3[/T] Increased tax rates affect China. In recent years, internal wars have frequently occurred, droughts and floods have occurred repeatedly, the national treasury is empty, and people's livelihood is declining. Needless to say, although the government has exhausted all resources, it is still difficult to implement various constructions. Therefore, it has to increase various tax rates to make up for maintenance. At this time, the sales of our cotton textiles are stagnant and business is dying. An increase in tax rates is also difficult to avoid. Once the tax rate is increased, the cost increases accordingly, and the selling price has to be slightly increased, causing the original sales market to suffer a sudden impact. The number of capitalists who have closed down due to their inability to maintain is not small. This is truly an unfortunate event for the future of China's industry. Does the government pay attention to it? [T13]4[/T] Workers lack unity and methods of improvement. The purpose of workers organizing groups is to unite the feelings of workers, improve industry, increase production, and implement the Three People's Principles and strive for the National Revolution. There are no fewer than dozens of cotton mills in Shanghai, and there are few organizations with strong strength. It can be seen that the disunity of our cotton mill workers is a glimpse. Without the unity of workers, each goes its own way, so what is there to discuss and improve? This is indeed the biggest shortcoming and the main reason why our cotton mill industry has failed to develop. It is easy to break a single arrow, and the crowd makes a city. The ancient teachings are now abandoned by the organization of great traitors. Why should people not blame themselves deeply? This is not what our cotton mill workers want. In short, if the cotton mill industry is not revitalized one day, the national industry will not be able to develop one day. Shanghai is the largest commercial port in the country, with cotton mills and workers numbering in the hundreds of thousands. Therefore, the development of Shanghai's cotton mill industry is of great importance to the entire country. This time, under the order of the Municipal Party Committee, members were sent to organize the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Cotton Mill Workers' Union for the great unity of the workers in this industry. Our association has complied with the order and organized it. However, the decline of our cotton mill industry and the painful groans of the workers are overwhelming. We still hope that all the workers in our cotton mill industry will unite with the benevolence of helping each other in the same boat, and under the leadership of the Party, strive for the labor movement, and use the spirit of labor-capital cooperation to improve the industry, seek our own liberation, and fight for the survival of the nation. This is what our association is eagerly looking forward to. Workers, unite together, uphold the teachings of the Prime Minister, with the spirit of great justice and selflessness, and the perseverance of unyielding efforts, promote the realization of the Three People's Principles, and raise the country to prosperity. The Party-State is fortunate, and the labor movement is fortunate. Shout our slogan: All the cotton mill workers in the city unite together, implement labor-capital cooperation, develop industry, seek our liberation, and overthrow the corrupt elements that undermine unity. To seek a way out, we must unite and implement the Three People's Principles. Long live the Chinese Kuomintang! Long live the workers' movement! Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Cotton Mill Workers' Union.</p>
<p>Silk Factory Industry: Federation of Trade Unions held its third preparatory meeting yesterday, publicly electing Chen Xiu Pu as chairman. Resolutions: [T13]1[/T] The standing committee members proposed that the association of the same industry decided to re-determine the method of promotion and notified each factory to implement it without obtaining the consent of the labor side beforehand. In order to avoid labor-capital disputes in the future, this association should send members to negotiate with the association to determine whether it is appropriate. It was decided to send Chen Bingyan, Le Xiaorong, and Yuan Yunlong to handle the matter. [T13]2[/T] Yuan Yunlong proposed to quickly determine the budget of this association. It was decided to hand it over to the standing committee members to prepare a budget table for the meeting to review.

It was decided to appoint Dean, Chen Bingyan, Chen Xiu Pu, Yuan Yunlong, and Chen Hansheng to form an editorial committee, and designate Dean as the editor-in-chief.

It was found that only Lu Xusheng attended the meeting to work after the first standing committee meeting decided to appoint three cadres, and the rest did not come to the meeting to serve. The standing committee members should be held strictly accountable. It was decided to send a letter to question and order the cadres to reply to the reason for not attending the meeting.

<h3 id="e177">Recent Dysentery Outbreak <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Health Bureau administers vaccinations and compiles printed materials</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, in view of the reports of infectious diseases sent by various hospitals after separate statistics, found that the number of dysentery cases has increased recently. It is preparing to provide free dysentery vaccinations for citizens, but because the reaction of the dysentery vaccination is very strong, it will not be administered unless the citizens request it themselves. It is also heard that the bureau has compiled a simple explanation of the cause of dysentery and the mode of transmission, prevention and treatment, and is printing it for wide publicity to facilitate the prevention methods. Do not eat items that have been touched by flies and raw water and raw tea. Contact with dysentery patients should wash hands and do not use the clothes, bedding and utensils that have been used by the patients and have not been disinfected. It is especially important because dysentery is a gastrointestinal disease and bacteria are often attached to the feet of flies or in raw water, so things that have been touched by flies and raw water must not be eaten to avoid accidentally introducing dysentery bacteria into the stomach and causing dysentery.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Eighteen Arrested in Ling Runxiang Assassination Case <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The bandits dripped blood on their hands before committing the crime and swore an oath. They used the excuse of performing a play on a wide stage to collect money. The detectives went to arrest them and captured them in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Ling Runxiang, a supervisor of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was shot and killed by thugs on the 28th of last month at the entrance of Dexingli, Peng Road. After the incident, Director Yuan paid great attention to the case and immediately issued an order to his subordinates to strictly investigate and arrest the perpetrators. After receiving the order, Captain Xu of the Investigation Team also instructed his staff to speed up the investigation and secretly offered a reward in order to solve the case as soon as possible. Now it is known that the principal culprit and suspects were arrested in the Guangwu Theater in Zhabei the day before yesterday. After being interrogated by Captain Lu one by one, they confessed in detail. They were escorted to the judicial section yesterday for review. The details of the arrest are explained in detail below.</p>
<p>Early Prevention: At the beginning of last month, when the Ling case had not yet occurred, Director Yuan repeatedly received secret reports that the reorganized faction and the confidants of Bai Chongxi and other rebels, the Guangdong brothers Ou Tian and Ou Chi, and the reactionaries such as Zhang Wei, Pan Qi, Zhang Xitang, and Ou Pei, were secretly lurking in Shanghai, colluding with local unemployed ruffians, and attempting to cause disturbances and disrupt the rear. Please order officials to arrest them quickly to curb the chaos. After receiving the report, Director Yuan considered the matter important and immediately ordered the Investigation Team to conduct a strict investigation in preparation for prevention.</p>
<p>Unemployed Loafers: After receiving the order, Captain Lu immediately informed his subordinates to find out the truth and report back within a limited time. After five days, the detectives reported back that the group was indeed hiding in Yuexiufang, Haining Road, Public Concession, and Dexingli, Peng Road, etc., and Pan Qi and Zhang Xitang were indeed famous unemployed loafers in Guangdong who had been wanted by Guangdong officials. Their reputation in the Hongkou area is quite bad.</p>
<p>Hearing the News and Taking Precautions: After receiving the reply, Director Yuan immediately secretly ordered Captain Lu to supervise the detectives to arrest them at the addresses together with the relevant patrol room to prevent them from escaping the net, and to conduct strict inspections of all books and letters in the residences of the criminals. When Captain Lu was preparing to start preparing, he suddenly received a report that the rebels had heard the news and were taking precautions, so it was inconvenient to act rashly. He then reported the situation to Director Yuan, who ordered him to slow down the time and wait for the rebels to organize themselves before annihilating them in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Performing a Play to Collect Money: After receiving the order, Lu was preparing to continue the investigation. Unexpectedly, on July 28, Supervisor Ling Runxiang was assassinated. A few days later, an informant secretly reported that the mastermind and persons related to the case were Ou Zhaocheng (ie Ou Tian) and Zhang Borong (ie Zhang Xitang), etc. The criminals were now borrowing the Guangwu Hall Theater in Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, to perform a play to collect money. Please go and arrest them quickly, etc. Then Captain Lu reported the situation to the director, who ordered the arrest.</p>
<p>Eighteen Arrested: Captain Lu, together with detectives Zhang Guangsen, Qi Haitian, Wang Shifu, Wang Yaogao, Ju Chuan, Shan Bin, Ding Shunbao, Han Ruisheng, Lv Xingchun, Han Jingxiang, Wu Kezhong, Zhou Peisan, Liu Furong, Wu Zuorong, Chen Jiren, Liu Yongfu, He Haifa, and Liu Enyu, went to arrest them together with the third patrol team at about 9 pm on the same day. Ou Tian, Zhang Xitang, Luo Baoliang, Guo Cheng, Liu Xizhuang, Liang Wenhong, Luo Yu, Ou Tu, Mo Yang, Ji Jiacong, Liang Biao, He Yaoquan, Ou Chuntong, He Wei, Luo Xianling, Zheng Lan, Yong Tan Guoan, Feng Wen and other eighteen people were arrested on the spot.</p>
<p>Informant's Words: When Captain Lu led the team to arrest them, he was deeply worried that the group would flee after hearing the news, so he first mixed the informant into the theater to monitor them from the side, and then rushed in and arrested them one by one and took them back to the team for interrogation. According to the confession, several days before the Ling case occurred, Ou Chuntong, Zhang Xitang, Feng and He, Ying Pan Qi, Ou Chang, Ou Zhuo, and Luo Qingyun were drinking tea in the Guangdong Merchant Tea House on North Sichuan Road to plan the assassination of He Ling (ie Ling Runxiang).</p>
<p>Swearing an Oath by Dripping Blood: The first suggestion was that A Ling is now working in the Public Security Bureau. We all know his appearance and everything about the case. I am afraid that it will be detrimental to me. At that time, I decided to assassinate him to silence him. This matter was discussed for seven or eight days before it was finalized. Later, Pan Qi, Liu Zuoqing, etc. were afraid that their determination would not be firm, so they invited us to the San Yuan Temple on Dong Wuchang Road to chop off a chicken's head, drip blood to swear an oath, and write a master word as proof to prove that everyone was determined. At that time, Ou Chuntong, Zhang Xitang, Liu Zuoqing, Ou Zhuo, Pan Qi, Feng and He Ying, and Lu Ju, along with ten people whose names were unknown, totaling twenty people, burned incense, kowtowed, and swore an oath.</p>
<p>Zhang's Confession: Afterwards, the daily expenses were all subsidized by Pan Qi alone. The leaders of this matter were Ou Tian, Ou Chi, Ou Pei, Zhang Wei, Pan Qi and other five people. Then Zhang Borong (ie Xitang) confessed that all of this was planned by Pan Qi several times. At that time, He Ying brought Lu Ju and three people surnamed Luo to do it together. They brought one Type 38 revolver and two five-seed lotus root type revolvers. He Ying fired the gun and killed Ling. After questioning the other criminals, their confessions were evasive and ambiguous. After questioning them one by one, they immediately reported to the director and prepared a document to transfer the criminals to the judicial section for legal processing.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Yang Mingsheng Commits Suicide Due to Mental Illness <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Acting abnormally and suffering from mental disorder, he jumped into the river and immediately drowned.</p>
<p>Yang Mingsheng, a 47-year-old man from Pudong Zhangjiangzha, used to work as a boat shaker in Baofeng Fish Shop, Wusong. Although he was a boatman, he was honest and upright, and his demeanor was always kind and amiable. Therefore, the superiors and subordinates of the shop were happy to associate with him, and the relationship was quite satisfactory. At lunchtime the day before yesterday, he suddenly changed his usual state, his actions changed suddenly, and he went to Baoshan alone to visit Zhao, who had been his colleague at the same time. Not long after, he went to the grave of a family outside the West Gate, and sat alone on top of the grave in the scorching sun. Passers-by suspected that he was ill, went up to call him, but he did not answer, and asked him, but he did not respond. Zhao then entered the city to inform Zhao, who went there to inquire, but the answers were not what he was asked. Zhao saw his strange behavior and incoherent words and knew that he had a mental disorder. He immediately accompanied him to Changchun Hotel, the site of the Song Commercial Association, and ordered him to sit and drink, while Zhao went to Baofeng to send a letter. Unexpectedly, Yang got up and went out after Zhao left, muttering to himself, "Someone is calling me to go with him," etc. As he spoke, he walked to the railway bridge on the west side of the Wusong Town Railway Station, took off his shoes, and jumped into the river and drowned without emerging. When his colleagues heard the news, they rushed to rescue him, but it was too late. Yesterday, the shop sent someone to report to his family and hired a boat to carry the body to Pudong for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Two Hostages in Dujiahang Kidnapping Case Have Escaped Danger <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The kidnappers' threats were extremely unbearable, and they escaped by wading through the water, which was extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>In Wangjiamiao, Dujiahang, Nanhui County, more than ten bandits suddenly came in the middle of the night on the 18th of last month and kidnapped the farmers Li Gengxing and Gong Zhilian, Li's brother-in-law. After receiving a letter from the bandits, they demanded a huge sum of money from the revolution. In the end, it was agreed that at 9 pm on the 11th of this month, they would contact at the entrance of Baoyuli, Aiduya Road, French Concession. The person who came must hold an umbrella and a bundle. After the owner reported to the Security Corps, they reported to Captain Xie of the Third Team of the First District of the Water Public Security Team. After receiving the report, Captain Xie specially sent Detective Shen Hexun to take an umbrella and a bundle to contact him. At the same time, he colluded with Chinese and Western detectives in the French patrol room to wait for him and arrested the bandits Min Xingren, Lin Fuxiang, and Shandong native Zhang Fangsheng on the spot. He was taken back to the patrol room and ordered to hand them over to the detective team to be taken to court for interrogation, which has been briefly recorded in the previous report. It is now known that the hostages Li Gengxing and Gong Zhilian escaped from the bandit den the day before yesterday and were safe. According to Gong's father, Sanhe, Gengxing and Zhilian did return on the 16th of this month. Because they had been in the bandit den for more than twenty days, they suffered great mental stimulation and are now recuperating in Nanhui Hospital. I (Gong called himself) opened the Xuxing Sugar Workshop in Dujiahang and am not rich. My son Zhilian is thirty-five years old this year. After dinner on the 18th of last month, he walked to his father-in-law's house in Wangjiamiao, Shitu, to chat. Unexpectedly, more than ten bandits suddenly came at 11 o'clock that night and kidnapped my son Zhilian and my son's younger brother Gengxing (28 years old) and drove them into the cabin and prohibited them from making a sound. Fortunately, their faces were not covered, so they looked out from time to time. They drove out of Shanghai from Shenzhuangtang. After two or three hours, they heard the sound of a machine coming from afar, and the electric light was very bright. I don't know where. After a few more hours, they reached a small river place, which was very desolate and there was no sound of chickens and dogs. They were ordered to stop and live in the bandit den for more than twenty days. The imprisonment was very strict and they did not move an inch. During the day, they could not fill their stomachs with food, and at night they could not sleep peacefully, and they were often threatened, which was especially unbearable. The night before last (15th), the two took the opportunity of the bandits to sleep soundly and sneaked away. Fortunately, the river water was not deep and they were able to escape.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>After a few miles, they frequently heard gunshots several times, so they hid in the fields. At dawn, they hired a car to their relatives' house to escort them home. It was a great luck to be reborn. It was unfortunate that they received letters from the bandits demanding 10,000 yuan. However, both families were poor and unable to raise funds, and there was no address to contact them, so they ignored them and listened to fate. On the 8th of this month, they received another letter from the bandits agreeing to contact them at the Yuli entrance of the French Concession on the evening of the 11th. They reported to the Security Corps and requested the Third Team of the Water Police to collude with the Chinese and Western detectives to arrest the two criminals Lin and Zhang and escort them back to the team headquarters. After being interrogated by Captain Xie, they prepared a document yesterday afternoon to send the two criminals to the court for legal processing.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Xu Meizhen's Repentance Marriage Record <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The childhood marriage contract was not agreed to, and the fiancé fled without any guilt.</p>
<p>Xu Meizhen, a woman from Zhangjiangzha, Pudong, father Chuanjiang works as a typecaster in the printing bureau, brother Jinzhang works as a typesetter in the Commercial Press. When Meizhen was eight years old, her father died of illness. When he was alive, Lu Deru and others matched Meizhen to Tang Pinmei's son. Unfortunately, Tang's son died of illness, and Meizhen became a widow (commonly known as a door-viewing widow). Later, her brother Jinzhang acted as the master, and Xi Liushi, Shen Meisheng and others acted as matchmakers. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, she was betrothed to Xi Qiren, the son of Xi Zhushu, a man from the 23rd Tu of the 20th Bao in Yuancheng City. At the time of the engagement, Meizhen was eleven years old and Qiren was nine years old. They were innocent and played with each other every day. Zhushu saw that his daughter-in-law was lively and smart, and he loved her very much. Zhushu was a member of the education circle with a new mind. He liked to read books and saw that the woman's family was poor and unable to cultivate her. He then started the Yuyu Primary School in his hometown and sent her to school. After more than three years, he changed to Yiguang Girls' School in Chuansha. The expenses for study, meals, books, and clothing were all fully borne by Zhushu (at that time, the woman's brother Jinzhang had died). In the third year after Meizhen entered school, Zhushu died of illness, and the tuition fees were not available, so she dropped out of school. Not long after, because the family situation was not as difficult as before, she changed to Zhangjiang School to study, and then changed to Nanhui Girls' Middle School. At that time, Xi Qiren was learning typesetting in Shanghai Xingye Sample Making Shop. His mother thought that Qiren was already a young man and his daughter-in-law had grown up. She planned to choose the 16th day of the first month of the next year of the abolished calendar to get married. On the 19th and 20th of May of this year, she invited the matchmaker twice to notify and replenish the festival ceremony. Unexpectedly, Meizhen and others scolded and refused to accept it. Xi Soshi (Qiren's mother) had no way to think about it, so she filed a lawsuit. On the day before yesterday, the Nanhui County Government summoned both parties to court. According to the matchmaker Xi Liushi, the Xu family had received 20 yuan for the engagement money and a gold hair clip. The Xu family was responsible for the reading and cultivation. The Xi family's engagement money was 60 yuan and the fees for Meizhen's childhood reading, etc., were not the case. Xi Soshi briefly supplied that her son Qiren suddenly disappeared due to the stimulation of this divorce. She searched everywhere and could not find him, so she did not appear in court. She could not agree to the termination of the marriage contract. Xu Liushi (Meizhen's mother) said that she could not be the master of the marriage contract and had to ask her daughter Xu Meizhen. Meizhen supplied that she absolutely requested the termination of the marriage contract. She asked Xi Qiren because he was stimulated and fled. If he committed suicide because of frustration in love, would you be able to live with him? She replied that I and him had been engaged since childhood, and I did not agree to it. There will never be a good feeling in the future. If he commits suicide, it has nothing to do with me. Moreover, the divorce is now stipulated in the party constitution of married people. It is absolutely free, let alone unmarried officials. Although the reasons for your request to terminate the marriage contract are very sufficient, it is inevitable that you are too thin in human relations. The interrogation was announced to be over and the debate was over, and both parties left.</p>

<p>Large gangs of pirates have been found one after another outside the Wusongkou Chongming Outer Sea. They have successively robbed Shenjiazhen in Chengxi and Ertiaoshuhe in Chengdong. When they left, they kidnapped 27 residents, etc. It is known that Gong Mianqin, the captain of the 17th team of the 4th district of the Jiangsu Water Public Security Team, immediately ordered the subordinate 1st, 2nd and 3rd sub-teams to strictly suppress the bandits after the incident. Yesterday, he took the Pingyang warship to Shenjiazhen and Ershuohe to investigate the robbery situation. He drew water police patrol boats and stationed them in various towns and towns to maintain security. The Junhe and Ce Dian warships of the Jiangsu Water Public Security Team set off from Song yesterday to scout and detect the traces of bandits and suppress them because bandit ships were found frequently in the outer sea.</p>

<p>Inferior to Wholly Healthy Livestock Meat</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau Announcement: This announcement concerns the fact that the purpose of the Bureau's livestock inspection is to prevent the sale of meat from plague-ridden animals under false pretenses, thereby protecting the health of citizens. Subsequently, if pigs, cattle, or sheep are found to have localized diseases, the diseased parts will still be removed, and the remaining parts will be stamped with a blue "Approved" mark. However, the stamp will also include the characters "Second Class" to indicate that the meat comes from pigs, cattle, or sheep that are not entirely disease-free. Although it is permissible to sell such meat for consumption, its quality is ultimately inferior to that of meat from completely healthy livestock, allowing citizens to make informed choices when purchasing.

<p>In recent years, the electricity consumption of the Wusong Bao Ming Electric Company has increased, and its business has gradually prospered. However, its scale is...</p>
<p>The belt is close to the walkway without a railing for protection, and the generator wiring is somewhat disorderly. After investigation, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities explained the deficiencies and methods of correction in detail and ordered compliance. It is recently learned that the company has successively improved according to the instructions. Recently, the bureau sent personnel to re-inspect and found that the generator belt was protected by railings, and the distribution board wiring had been reconfigured in an orderly manner, which was considered satisfactory. Recently, under the supervision of the bureau, the company also negotiated with the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to purchase electricity (i.e., purchase electricity from Zhabei for resale), which has also been properly agreed upon and will soon be implemented. All electrical lines within the business area of ​​Bao Ming Company must be thoroughly reformed in order to be properly maintained. Therefore, the bureau sent personnel to survey the distribution of lines inside and outside the factory and prepared a plan to refer to for changes as a precaution.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Appeal from the Tobacco Exchange Association <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Seeking Assistance for Member Yongshengxiang</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Association sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce stating: Our association has received a letter from member Yongshengxiang Tobacco Shop, stating that our shop's transactions of goods have always been conscientious and have long been praised by all sectors. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of July 31, the British and French constabularies, at the request of De Gaoyang Foreign Firm, falsely accused our shop of selling counterfeit Old Beauty cigars and sent more than ten detectives to search the premises for more than an hour. As a result, nothing was found, and a summons from the court was left behind. Such unwarranted accusation is unbearable. Our shop's business reputation has been greatly affected, and it concerns the safety of our entire industry, which is not a minor matter. It is impossible to endure, so we specially send a letter to request prompt assistance and strict negotiations. It is found that Yongshengxiang Tobacco Shop has been open on Minguo Road for many years and has more than ten branches. The industry all trusts it. This time, the unwarranted frame-up is extremely shocking. Since there is no evidence and no proper procedures, it is unfair. After several industry meetings, it was unanimously agreed that the firm's failure to conduct a thorough examination and rashly taking such drastic measures is too oppressive. In this situation, not only will the firm's reputation be damaged, but also all future dealings between the industry will be wary. It is requested that all parties provide assistance to uphold justice, promptly find a way to provide assistance to reassure businesses and protect credibility. We will be extremely grateful.</p>

<p>Sentenced to One Year and Two Months for Repeated Theft and Pawning</p>
<p>Su Wu, a woman from Yancheng in her thirties who lived above a cigarette paper shop near Xizang Road and Xizang Hotel, was by nature adulterous and had a relationship with Chen Lanting, a 44-year-old man from Jiangxi, for three or four months. Her husband, Wu A'si, initially knew nothing about it, but Chen was a habitual thief who had been arrested by the police for stealing other people's belongings and handed over to the court for punishment more than ten times. The woman still had an affair with him, which was the height of adultery. On the evening of the 15th of this month, Chen took Wu to the Wuzhou Hotel at 486 Guangdong Road and opened room number three, where they slept together. At six o'clock the next morning, Chen woke up, but the woman was still fast asleep, so he stole a set of fragrant gauze shirt and trousers that the woman had taken off and left her in the room. Later, Chen, carrying the shirt and trousers, passed the corner of Hubei Road and Haikou Road and was seen by patrol officers from number 687, etc., who found him suspicious and immediately arrested him. After checking his fingerprints, they learned that he was a habitual thief. When asked about the origin of the clothes, Chen could not deny it and confessed everything. In addition to detaining Chen, the head of the patrol sent detectives Wang Shusen and Qiu Sijiu to the Wuzhou Hotel. At that time, the woman was having a good dream and was ashamed and indignant when she heard the whole story. Yesterday morning, the police escorted Chen to the Special District Local Court, and the woman also appeared in court to testify. After questioning by Judge Zhou, Chen Lanting was sentenced to one year and two months in prison, and the clothes were returned to the original owner. As for Chen, he committed adultery and stole her belongings, so his crime is unforgivable.</p>

<p>Chen A'si Can Be Described as Unscrupulous</p>
<p>Huo Fengchi, a patrol leader of the fourth squadron of the Lujiazai Police in Pudong, was patrolling near Xiaoshiqiao in Yangjiazai yesterday morning at 11:00 a.m. when he noticed a man and a woman arguing suspiciously at the door of number 137. He questioned the man, who claimed to be husband and wife, but the woman claimed that she had been abducted by the man. The patrol leader, seeing that their statements did not match, arrested them together with Hu Peide, the landlord of the house, and transferred them to the third district Public Security Bureau. After questioning by the district chief, the man confessed that his name was Chen A'si, 32 years old, from Chongming, living at Qingyili 782, Chengdu Road, Public Concession. He worked as a rickshaw puller and was currently living with his wife at the home of his relative Hu Peide in Pudong. The woman confessed that her surname was Zhou, Lu, 27 years old, from Suzhou. Her husband's name was Zhou Xishou, and he sold Yuan Tuan (a type of glutinous rice ball) at a sand washing ground in her hometown. She had two sons, the eldest of whom was dead, and the youngest was only two years old. She had been working as a helper at the Zhou residence in Qingyili, Chengdu Road, for three months. Chen had seduced her with sweet words and had sex with her several times. Two weeks ago, he lured her to Hu Peide's house in Pudong and prevented her from going out, intending to sell her. She requested to be rescued. Hu confessed that he was related to Chen, but he did not know anything else. The district chief determined that Chen had committed adultery with a married woman, attempted to profit from evil schemes, and was extremely illegal. He ordered that the three be detained and sent to the local court for trial.</p>

<p>Dan Yuanbi, a visitor from Yangjiadu, Caonitang, number 48 in Pudong, worked in Wusong, leaving his wife, Song, at home to keep house. The woman did not observe the ways of a woman and had an affair with Zhang Facai. Taking advantage of her husband's frequent absences, she often had secret meetings with her lover. The other day, Dan returned home because of business. When he walked into the room, he saw Zhang and the woman both naked in bed. Dan was furious and stepped forward to grab them, but Zhang immediately jumped up and punched Dan in the right eye, causing Dan to lose consciousness and fall to the ground. The adulterer even punched and kicked him. Fortunately, neighbors helped to restrain Zhang and called the police, who arrested him and transferred him to the first precinct of the third district and then to the local court for trial.</p>

<p>Wang Hua, a woman from Wuxi in Zhoujiaqiao, Shanghai, whose son, Wang Jinbao, is 21 years old, does not engage in proper employment and specializes in roaming. The woman beat her unruly son yesterday, but Jinbao claimed that his mother abused him for no reason and scratched his face. He became angry and smashed the miscellaneous items in the house. The woman, believing that a mother should not reprimand her son, was too outrageous and called the police to arrest Jinbao and send him to the Sixth District Police Station and then to the local court. But the woman suddenly had deep feelings for her son and begged for mercy on his behalf in court, so he was released without further investigation.</p>

His wife, Zhang, is 33 years old and also from Shaoxing. After Ge finished his work and returned home after 10 o'clock the night before, he had an argument with his wife due to the uncleanliness of the household. Yesterday morning at dawn, Ge went out to work, but his wife took advantage of her husband's departure and secretly swallowed raw opium ash to commit suicide. That evening, neighbors noticed and hurriedly called Meicheng back home and used a car to send her to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, she had already died by the time she arrived at the hospital.</p>

<p>Old Mother Could No Longer Endure and Made an Accusation</p>
<p>Wang Hua, a 53-year-old woman from Wuxi, currently lives at number 32, Xihuaqinfang, Zhoujiaqiao, Shanghai. She lost her husband early and relied on working in a yarn factory for a living. She gave birth to a son named Jingbao, who is now 21 years old, and raised him with difficulty. She asked someone to help him get a job at the Shenxin Yarn Factory. At first, he was quite frugal, so his mother loved him especially because he was her only son. A few years ago, she hired a Ding woman to marry her son. His mother, because she was old and weak, was planning to rely on her son and daughter-in-law to spend her remaining years. Unexpectedly, her son Jingbao suddenly changed his ways since last year and no longer engaged in proper employment, specializing in associating with rogues, roaming and gambling. Despite repeated persuasion from his mother and wife, it was ineffective. The clothes in the house were pawned by him. Recently, it has become even more absurd. Not only does he not care for his mother and wife, but he also occasionally mistreats his old mother and beats his wife for no reason. At about 6:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, Jingbao returned home and demanded money from his mother, and she kept pestering her. When she did not get what she wanted, she cursed her mother and almost beat her. The mother could no longer endure and immediately called the police to come and arrest the rebellious son and take him back to the Sixth District Police Station. After questioning by District Chief Ren, it was determined that the crime of the case was unfilial to his old mother and that he could not be excused. Yesterday, a document was prepared and he was sent to the local court for trial.</p>

<p>Chopping at Wife's Head with a Cleaver</p>
<p>Wang Gu, a woman from Yancheng in her forties, lives on a boat in Tanziwan, Zhabei. Her husband, Wang Wencai, has been married for many years and has been harmonious. However, Wang now has another affair and often lingers outside for days without returning home, neglecting his family. Yesterday, Wang earned twenty-two dollars and eight cents from a counting job, and Gu asked him for two dollars to buy tung oil to coat the boat. But at this time, Wang Wencai regarded his wife as an enemy and refused to give her a penny. Gu, feeling that her husband was so ruthless, refused to give up and rushed forward to hug his feet and cry. Unexpectedly, this provoked Wang's anger, and he grabbed the cleaver on the table and chopped at Gu's head, causing blood to flow like a fountain. A crowd of neighbors gathered, all speaking out for her injustice. They immediately called a patrol officer from another post to arrest Wang and take him to the third squadron of the police and then to the fourth district headquarters. After questioning by Director Jin, it was determined that the case was related to abuse of his wife, and he was ordered to be sent to the bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e194">The Villainous Scheme of Thugs at the Wharf <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Swapping Fake Silver Coins with Plaster</p>
<p>Recently, at the wharves along the Huangpu River from the Ningshao Wharf, Dada Wharf, to the New Wharf in Nanshi, there has been a group of vagrants disguised as rickshaw pullers and porters, mingling in the crowd. When ships arrive and passengers disembark, they pretend to carry goods and transport luggage, and then take the opportunity to steal luggage and miscellaneous items. When passengers who have had their goods carried ashore pay the porters, they use their deceptive means to falsely claim that the silver coins paid are not good and forcibly swap them. They then use lead or copper coins to exchange for silver coins. Or after being noticed by passengers, a search of their bodies also finds no conclusive evidence, and they can only pay the price. In fact, these people first put the fake silver coins in the largest plaster and stick it on their bodies. Whenever passengers pay, they have already taken out the fake silver coins from the plaster without being prepared. After the good silver coins are hidden, they strongly swap the fake coins. As a result, there are countless victims among the travelers. Their skills are extremely cunning, so although Chen Youhua, the district chief of the first district in charge, has sent police to investigate in various places for days and has been quite strict, he has not yet made any arrests.</p>

<p>Wang Chunbo, a native of Yangzhou, opened a Xinhua Copperware and Electric Light Shop at 4 Houpi Lane, Baoxingli, French Concession. He married Xu, a woman from the same hometown (29 years old), as his wife. The relationship between the couple was still strong, but there were often quarrels between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. The day before yesterday, there was another dispute over trivial matters, and Xu suddenly had a suicidal thought. She secretly took poison and committed suicide at 10:00 a.m. At 3:00 p.m., she had a poison attack. Her husband learned of it and sent her to Renji Hospital for treatment. Because she was too poisoned, the treatment was ineffective and she died in the hospital at 5:00 a.m. yesterday. The hospital notified the police to order detectives to carry the body to the Tongren Fuyuanyuan Hall for an autopsy. Zhu, the presiding judge of the Criminal Section of the French Police, came to the hall at 11:00 a.m. to inspect the body. He first sat in the public seat and had the bailiff report the previous situation. After Mr. Zhu questioned the husband of the deceased, he ordered that Wang Xu had indeed died of her own will due to some reason before her death. The police were ordered to select a Western doctor to examine the body and submit a report. After the examination, Wang Chunbo, the husband of the deceased, was allowed to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>

<p>Liu Yinlong, a tea customer at the Tongfuyuan Teahouse at 562 Xiaoshadu Road in Shanghai, suddenly had a broken electric wire at about 7:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, and all the lights went out. Liu Yinlong, who claimed to be good at repairing, started working. Occasionally, he accidentally touched the electric wire with his finger and fell to the ground. By the time he was sent to the hospital, the electricity had already attacked his heart, and it was too late for treatment, so he died. After receiving the report, the police sent detectives to carry the body to the autopsy hall on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Xu, a prosecutor from the Special District Local Court, came to the hall to investigate and confirmed that it was a fatal electric shock. Shao Jiu, the director of the teahouse, felt deeply sorry for Liu's sacrifice for repairing the lights for his shop and agreed to give Liu Li, the wife of the deceased, 80 yuan per year for five consecutive years and signed a contract. So he accompanied the wife of the deceased to the case to explain the process. Prosecutor Xu then ordered the woman to sign and receive the body for burial.</p>
<p>Shen Yinfathe, an apprentice at a electric light repair shop at 576 Beijing Road, Shen Yinfa, was only 17 years old. At 8:45 p.m. the night before last, he was repairing an electric fan in the shop. However, his skills were still immature, so he was shocked and the shop owner sent him to Renji Hospital by car. But it was too late to save him and he died soon after. The Laozha Police Station, after receiving the report, sent detectives to carry the body to the autopsy hall on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Xu from the Special District Local Court came to the hall to inspect and ordered the brother of the deceased, Shen Jinxiang, to sign and receive the body for burial.</p>

After spending a night, she prepared to leave yesterday morning and checked her luggage one by one. Unexpectedly, more than one hundred dollars stored in the rattan basket suddenly disappeared. In a hurry, she asked the waiter, who claimed not to know. Later, she twisted the inn owner Song Liqing to the first district station for investigation and requested investigation. It was ordered to wait for the warden to conduct a preliminary review and handle it.</p>

<p>Appears to Suffer from Mental Illness</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 p.m., a middle-aged man resembling a coolie suddenly threw himself into the Huangpu River at Pengjia Wharf in Landidu, Pudong. Fortunately, he was rescued by a boatman and handed over to the post police, who took him to the third district for questioning. He claimed that his name was Zhang Aba, 31 years old, from Danyang, living in Huangjiagou, Pudong, working as a handyman. The act of jumping into the river was because Guanyin Bodhisattva called him to wash his body so that he could ascend to heaven. He also said that no one should ask any more questions, otherwise he would report to the authorities. District Chief Zhang considered that his words were incoherent and seemed to be insane. He could not reason with him, so he ordered the police to inform his wife, Leng, to take her husband back and monitor his actions to prevent a second suicide.</p>

<p>Jurisdictional Issues Still to Be Resolved</p>
<p>A Liu from Hangzhou moved with his family to Rixinli, Duntu Road in Shanghai. Later, he returned to Hangzhou for medical treatment and died in his residence on Huashi Street in Hangzhou. The estate of more than 50,000 yuan was all in his hometown. However, his wife and old mother are still living in Shanghai. A daughter named Liu Qiang, who is at the age of a flower, lives in Zhongwang Lane 214, Ningbo Road. She has a new style of short hair fashion. Now, because a daughter also has the right to inherit the estate, she has hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against her stepmother, Liu Li, for the division of the estate. The case opened at the Special District Local Court yesterday morning by Judge Xu Wenrong. The defendant, Liu Li, did not arrive and only sent a letter to the court in advance stating that her address was in Hangzhou, which was not under the jurisdiction of the concession court. Liu Qiang claimed that the defendant often traveled between Hangzhou and Shanghai, and that her grandmother was still living in Shanghai. She also submitted a list of the estate as evidence, saying that she now requested to divide the estate equally with her brother. After reviewing it, Judge Xu considered that the property listed in the list was all located in the Zhejiang area, and the person being inherited had died in Hangzhou. The case should be conducted in Hangzhou for convenience. The plaintiff's lawyer argued that it should be resolved in Shanghai. Judge Xu then ordered a change of date to investigate the jurisdictional issues clearly before proceeding.</p>

The general manager of the factory, Mr. Xiang, accompanied them on the observation. He led all the employees and students to hold a meeting to welcome Mr. Zhang. Mr. Zhang gave a speech entitled "The True Happiness of Life." He said that to achieve this goal, the following points must be observed: (1) Moral cultivation. The late Prime Minister wanted to restore the original morals of the Chinese people, so moral cultivation should be the beginning. Everyone should strictly observe the factory regulations and receive true factory training to cultivate morals. (2) Physical exercise, divided into labor and exercise. The factory is a place of labor. Everyone should work hard and tirelessly during work hours to embody the true meaning of exercise. More importantly, they should practice martial arts. First, it can preserve the national essence and promote the national glory. Second, it can strengthen the body and strengthen the race, fundamentally saving the country. Third, it can resist foreign aggression and avenge national humiliation. Fourth, it can self-hygiene and survival. After the speech, Mr. Xiang gave a speech briefly saying that listening to Mr. Zhang's experienced words is better than reading ten years of books. He deeply hoped that colleagues would realize and implement every sentence in order to live up to Mr. Zhang and their own ears. Next, martial arts colleagues performed martial arts on the spot. The employees and students of the dragon swimming and tiger leaping Qi Wan Shen were full of admiration. It is heard that Mr. Xiang准 has invited Mr. Zhang to send a martial arts expert to train the factory's employees and students. Mr. Zhang has agreed.

Bai was no match and escaped. When he left, he said, "You guys be careful, I'll give you a taste of my power tonight." Ye was timid and afraid of being harmed, so he and his wife, Wei, hid elsewhere. However, his two-year-old son, Xiaodaozi, was sleeping soundly on the orange and it was inconvenient to carry him, so they abandoned him. Yesterday morning at 5:00 a.m., he took the opportunity to sneak into the house, intending to take the child away. Unexpectedly, Xiaodaozi was lying stiffly in the yard.

<h3 id="e207">Letter <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor: I was surprised to read in your newspaper on the 13th of this month that I lost a check due to lack of wedding expenses and committed suicide by throwing myself into the river. I was ordered by my boss to go to the countryside on the 18th of last month to collect debts. I did not receive a check for one hundred taels of silver until the beginning of this month, and I planned to return to Shanghai to report back to my boss. Unexpectedly, I suddenly felt weak and had diarrhea. I sought medical treatment and have not yet recovered. I immediately sent a letter to my younger brother, Ji Yue, to inform my boss about the check. As for the so-called suicide note, it is even more fabricated. I think someone is holding a grudge and intentionally damaging my reputation. This kind of rumor is completely inconsistent with the facts. Since my reputation is at stake, please check and correct it to match the facts. Sincerely, Cai Duming, 86.</p>

<p>One in Ten Travels to Canada</p>
<p>New York News: Americans are known for their fondness for traveling abroad. Not to mention those who go to Europe, the total amount of money spent by American tourists in Canada in the previous year actually reached 600 million yuan. The number of cars crossing the border was about 4.5 million, with an average of three people per car, totaling 13 million people, which means that one in ten Americans travels to Canada. In addition, there are also a considerable number of people who travel by train and ship. Also, judging from the number of cars alone, there were 800,000 more last year than the previous year, and the number is gradually increasing. Also, because alcohol is prohibited in the United States, a large number of people cross the border to buy and drink.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Revenue of South Manchuria Railway Decreases <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>6 Million Yuan Decrease from April to July</p>
<p>World News Agency reports, according to Japanese sources, that the South Manchuria Railway has been affected by the sluggish world market and its business performance is currently sluggish. The revenue has decreased by 6 million yuan compared to the previous year. In addition, the transportation of special products has decreased and coal prices have plummeted, making the situation quite difficult. If this trend continues, it may be necessary to reduce interest distribution in the next period.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Plants Possess Morality <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>According to discoveries by biologists, all plants not only breathe but also have a circulatory system through which their life fluids flow, just like animals. Recently, scientists have discovered that some plants possess morality. For example, there is licorice in India, the petals of which are extremely sensitive to changes in climate and can predict storms, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. There is also a plant called the compass plant, whose petals and leaf tips always point north and can serve as a compass for those lost. There is also a parasitic grass that clings to other trees year-round, absorbing their sap, but when the leaves of the host tree wither in the harsh winter, the grass returns the nutrients it absorbed in the spring and summer to the trunk of the host tree. There is also an orchid that grows on trees but obtains its nutrients from the air, never taking anything from the tree it parasitizes, and in return for the favor of shelter, it is willing to use its beautiful self as an ornament for the tree's leaves. However, there are also extremely immoral plants that specialize in preying on their own kind and insects. The most ferocious of these is called the Venus Fly Trap. Its two leaves form a beautiful cup surrounded by floral whiskers. Inside, it stores fragrant juice to lure insects. When an insect touches its whiskers, the leaf cup closes and traps it. There is also an aquatic plant called Bladderwort, which uses the same method to capture aquatic insects and small fish. Another is the Madagascar Pitcher, which can use its twin leaves to capture fairly large rats, and its nature is particularly cruel. Inside its leaf trap, there are extremely fine sharp thorns to stab its captives to death and eat them.</p>

<p>According to the World News Agency, Tokyo reports that a joint transportation conference was held in Shenyang in mid-July by the Beining, Sitao, Taoang, and Qikesi Railways. It was decided that there would be one round-trip passenger train per day between Beiping and Dahushan, between Tongliao and Zhengjiatun, between Zhengjiatun and Taonan, and between Taonan and Ang'angxi. The maximum waiting time at interchange points between sections would be one hour. Furthermore, the Shenhai and Jihai lines will also open to traffic on August 1. While this matter appears on the surface to be merely a matter of business negotiations between Chinese railways, it is in fact a measure taken by the Dongsan Provinces government to implement its policy toward the South Manchuria Railway. The Japanese government is paying close attention to this recent development. Regarding the implementation of this joint transportation, it has recently been learned that the Northeast Political Affairs Committee, the administrative body of the Dongsan Provinces government, has decided to reduce railway freight rates in various provinces, with the intention of attracting passengers and goods from the South Manchuria Railway and substantially recovering the benefits of the South Manchuria Railway. Therefore, instructions and announcements are being issued to the general public to ensure a thorough understanding of this intention.</p>

<h3 id="e217">War <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Guang Mei</p>
<p>Politics can influence literature and art, and literature and art can influence politics. Certain political conditions can produce certain forms of literature and art, and the construction of certain literature and art can create certain political conditions. The two have a mutual relationship that cannot be separated. At the same time, literature and art are products of a nation, the crystallization of the nation's development process. In other words, literature and art belong to the nation, which cannot be denied.</p>
<p>In literature and art, opposing war has become fashionable. They believe that as long as nations exist in the world, war is inevitable. They consider all wars to be evil and that the only way to eliminate wars between nations is through class struggle. I do not understand this view. When the Japanese killed the worker Gu Zhenghong during the May Thirtieth Incident, why did a group of students rise up to support him, disregarding everything to form a procession on Nanjing Road and give speeches, resulting in such a shocking and bloody tragedy? All Chinese people, no matter how deeply they were asleep, were completely awakened by this and were all agitated and excited. At this time, compatriots across the country responded unanimously, and all who heard it were outraged. As a result, support associations sprang up everywhere, raising donations to help the striking compatriots. People who were usually extremely frugal were willing to donate generously. If class consciousness were more important than national consciousness, why would the Chinese people have risen up in such a unified movement? And why would the so-called bourgeoisie in China not help the Japanese capitalists who killed Gu Zhenghong to oppress the Chinese laborers, but instead help the Chinese laborers to resist the Japanese capitalists? At the same time, why would the laborers of Japan or other countries not rise up to help the Chinese laborers to resist the Japanese capitalists? All Chinese people, including scholars, farmers, workers, merchants, and government officials, rose up in a unified movement. What is the reason for this? Furthermore, recently, when the Great Light Theater premiered, Hong Shen, unafraid of death, saw it and considered it an insult to the Chinese nation. The film depicted Chinese people selling opium and committing theft in foreign countries, but it did not specify that these were done by university professors or so-called intellectuals. Since those ugly deeds had nothing to do with Hong Shen, why did he impatiently begin to lecture, demanding that the theater owner refund the tickets? When this case was heard in court, the audience was particularly large and excited, causing a nationwide sensation. Telegrams from all provinces and cities could be read in the newspapers. Such matters, which had nothing to do with Hong Shen's personal pain or with the Chinese intellectual class, caused Hong Shen to go crazy, and why did the whole country follow him in his madness? What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>Under such simple and obvious circumstances, the so-called importance of class consciousness over national consciousness is naturally self-defeating.</p>
<p>Here, a long-unresolved problem arises. This problem is the issue of nationalism and war. Recently, I read Mr. Dickinson's article "War" in the seventh issue of "The Vanguard Weekly," which explains the war problem that we have long wanted to resolve but could not, in a thorough and vivid manner. Now, I excerpt the most poignant sections below:</p>
<p>Regarding war, whether domestic or foreign, we should recognize its nature. There are wars of imperialism invading other nations or countries, wars of nations seeking independence and freedom, wars of countries seeking independence and freedom, wars of domestic warlord separatism, and wars of party banditry. We should undoubtedly make every effort to attack feudal separatism, imperialism, and party wars. In the pursuit of national freedom and independence, when a nation resists foreign aggression, this mutual conflict is a just resistance and a just advancement. If the Chinese nation wants to achieve its goal of independence and freedom, it must first eliminate all imperialist, warlord, and party aggression and oppression. To eliminate this aggression, plunder, and oppression, and to achieve independence and freedom, we must pay the price with our strength and blood. We firmly believe that national independence and freedom can only be exchanged for strength and blood, and that national humiliation can only be washed away with strength and blood. In order to awaken the national consciousness, we should use the power of literature and art to depict, express, and eternally engrave on the hearts of the general public and eternally infuse into the blood of the general public all the moving, admirable, inspiring, and touching deeds of all wars for national independence and freedom, so that they know that this kind of war should be commemorated and celebrated.</p>
<p>The problem that we have long wanted to solve but could not has thus been resolved very thoroughly.</p>

<p>— Tang Zengyang</p>
<p>"The Short Story Monthly," April Issue</p>
<p>The most typical and artistic poetry has been silent for a long time in the seemingly weak Chinese literary world. If it is to be revived, it contains infinite hope and will happen soon. Because, with our keen eyes, we observe the Chinese literary world, and the highest artistic expression of poetry is full of the phenomenon of re-emerging. Moreover, its content and form are different from the poems created by scholars who vigorously advocated the literary movement of the May Fourth era. They are completely different. This is probably because modern poets have a deeper understanding and are more cautious when writing poetry, washing away the strange phenomena of the past poetry world, the so-called style of crude production. At the same time, the authorities in the literary world are particularly strict in selecting poetry, simply using another eye to appreciate this poetry that reveals true feelings, thus raising the inherent value of poetry.</p>
<p>To know that the most beautiful flower to expect for the re-opening of poetry is of course to see the efforts of the so-called young poets who are slightly cultivated. Each poem only seeks qualitative fulfillment and refinement. In terms of quantity, I hope it is not as good as the crude production of the May Fourth era, but most of the power can be said to be the lifeline of the revival of poetry, which still relies on the current sincere advocates who are in charge of the literary world, just like in the Western poetry world. At the same time, there must be loyal critics to emerge.</p>
<p>In the past two years, "The Short Story Monthly" has not published poetry. The April issue of the recently published "The Short Story Monthly" suddenly discovered the poetry selection column before the creation, including six original poems and one translated poem, which is a surprising surprise to those of us who have a great taste for poetry.</p>
<p>In fact, what we need now is poetry that belongs to nationalism. What is full of decadent colors, sad cries, violent calls, romantic words, etc. as the content of poetry is not needed in the near future, nor is it absolutely not needed in the future. In other words, what is urgently hoped to be produced at present is poetry that greatly expresses the Chinese nation, moving forward, upward, fighting for freedom and prosperity. Of course, there are still people working hard in this direction. Several of the poems published in the recent "The Short Story Monthly" are creations full of national consciousness, even Zheng Zhenduo's translated poem "The Death of a Knight" is like this. Now, I will introduce them separately below.</p>
<p>Liu Yanling's "The Sky" is a narrative poem of nearly one hundred lines, using May, which has the most national humiliation memorial days, as the background of the whole poem. Because of this piercing May, it reminds us of Japan's aggression against China, the various misfortunes of the two boils on the fingertips of Lushun, etc. At the same time, the author also holds a passionate hope for China, urging the youth who are still lingering in their dreams. In his poems, it can be seen very clearly:</p>
<p>Scene after scene, we remember clearly, as clear as the face of Mount Fuji. China is a tender green leaf, you are like an insect, always running it. China is a beautiful and clean young man, who was mistaken for your powdery and greasy fragrance and took off his clothes to see his skin. Heaven knows the sores and scars behind it.</p>
<p>We can understand how enthusiastic and deeply nationalistic the author's mood was when writing, filled with words that can arouse the reader's sincere love for China, and make people feel how unbeautiful it is that such a beautiful and clean young man has so many sores and scars on his body, and how should we heal these wounds and restore the true face of the past? I believe that readers who have read the two sections of poems quoted above are at least deeply imprinted with such a general concept. Indeed, poetry is the highest expression of emotion in art, and it can move people's hearts and be so profound and powerful.</p>
<p>Winter rests, all life droops, and dead leaves carry on hand in hand, which means that if we work hard like this, what national humiliation will not be cleared away? The germination of all kinds of flowers in spring implies the future prosperous national destiny, but their deep and secret intentions are not as piercing as the heart in May.</p>
<p>This is true. How painful it is to remember all our national humiliations. If we unite and work hard for the country, the national humiliation will eventually be cleared away. We should also know that our Chinese nation contains unlimited hope in the future, just like the germination of all kinds of flowers in spring, full of green vitality. We Chinese people must remember this May, which has supreme wounds, in its entirety. The author's symbolism is also very strong. Let's look at the ending of his poem:</p>
<p>Wave after wave, another wave of memories drips until dawn. Sisters and brothers, don't sleep, listen forever, hear until dawn every night.</p>
<p>The author of Zheng Zhenduo's translated poem "The Death of a Knight" is unknown. According to the translator's note, this poem was translated several years ago, but it has been forgotten in the pile of books until now, and the author of the original poem and the original book it came from have also been forgotten. Because it is exciting and gratifying, it is specially taken out and published here. This is of course a regret, but it is only good if the content of the poem is particularly full and exciting, and this poem is full of very deep national ideas. It is strange that the translator's note did not remind him of this point.</p>
<p>I drink the first glass of wine, holding a knife, for him, for the people who died for the motherland, drink this glass. Now quickly drink the second glass, this will be drunk for freedom, and then the enemies of freedom will have to escape.</p>
<p>My love, the cup is empty, the bullets are ringing, the rider is shouting, there is no time to drink and sing anymore. Come, break the cup, and my love will go to the enemy. There is no death more joyful than this.</p>
<p>The whole poem is rich in very deep national central ideas. Because of the length of this publication, the whole poem could not be quoted here, which is a pity. When general poetry writers read this translated poem, I really don't know how to work hard. At the same time, I hope that the translator will introduce more of this type of poem.</p>
