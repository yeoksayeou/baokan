<p>時評</p>
<h3>英日之政潮</h3>
<p>英國之保守。黨藉經濟政策攻敵工黨政府預計將於七月間推倒之。日本之政友會。因緊縮政策。攻敵現在之政府。亦以爲非打倒之不可。英日兩國之政府。現均爲反對黨有所藉口而反對。而所藉口者。均爲經濟問題。均爲商業之衰落問題。雖一則爲英帝國之經濟統一。一則爲日政府之緊縮政策。而其原因皆由於商市之不振。或爲補救。或因怨望其實際固相同也。</p>
<p>工商業立國之國家。一經商業之衰落。則首先受其影響。受影響之後。勢必力求補救。補救而無效在野之政黨。勢必藉此以攻擊政策之不當。故經濟問題起其國之政潮。亦必隨之並起。經濟之變化愈烈而其國之政潮亦必隨之愈烈。蓋人心當困難之時每思易一方法以求解除其因難無論其方法之有效與否。必以爲試之終勝於不試。故反對黨之反對。每每因此而成功然而世界商業衰頽之象。已成一時無可挽回之大勢。即使反對黨成功而執政其政策亦未必能有效徒爲他日他黨之資而已。故世界經濟界而長此不安。各國之政潮。亦必起伏而靡定也</p>

<h3>少女雙溺記</h3>
<p>— 白沙涙痕</p>
<p>諺云。人爲財死。鳥爲食亡。但時至今日。米珠薪桂。吾儕小民。窮年累日。碌碌如牛馬。而衣不蔽體。食不充腸者。尤恒河沙數。是則人也。窮年也。致命而求者。皆爲食耳。財云胡哉。如日前走所目覩二少女雙溺之慘劇。益令人感到窮人生活。眞鳥鵲不啻。而其生命。乃幾等於螻蟻矣。心惻不已。爰不憚詞費。紀其始末曰。</p>
<p>在楊樹浦黃浦碼頭之對岸。其地萬家燈火。村落至廣。統稱曰浦東。走所記之二少女。即居於其地之比鄰也。長者年十七。籍浦東。次者年十五。籍寗波，同在楊樹浦紗廠中爲工女。値日工時。則晨出暮歸。値夜工時。則暮出晨歸。寒暑不間。風雨無阻。二女習以爲常者。亦數年於茲矣。廠方爲防範渡浦之危險計。無論其廠主籍。爲中爲外。皆有特備之小火輪。届時候於岸次。送往迎來。由是届於浦東者。咸樂其穩固便利。一般貧家婦女，莫不爭渡江來。以謀生活。乃日前午后五時許小火輪從對岸載數十人而來。悉爲上夜工者傍輪之碼頭。先則靠有满載花衣之船二艘迨輪至。乃不得靠岸。其時進工之三回聲。忽嗚嗚而鳴。船上工女咸大急。蓋時過則不得進廠也。於是羣趨於花衣船上之花衣包上。欲越其船而登岸。斯時膽怯驚呼者有之。謔浪作態者有之。乃撲通一聲。花衣十數件。悉爲衆工女踏翻於江中。工女随而墮江者。十餘人。幸舟子尙多。設法拯起。一片驚惶錯亂之聲。乃轟動遠近。此被沉二少女之母。聞訊而至。見被拯起者。無其女在内。方私自稱幸。以爲已進廠矣。迨經人探實。則已沈諸江底。二女之母。乃大號。厥狀至慘。而無情江水。一片汪洋。招魂無術。辟水無方。亦誠無可奈何也。斯時天色已暮。二老嫗祇得含涙而歸。翌晨。二少女之屍。竟不爲潮水冲去。而浮於江面。殆亦江神有靈。哀其無辜。而留之邪。經舟子撈起。面目尙可辨。皮肉則呈青紫色。腹膨大如有孕然。老嫗見狀。哭之益哀。嗚乎慘矣。幸廠方仁慈。給恤數百元。用以治殮。由是以觀。諺所謂鳥爲食亡者。殆即指此貧苦之小民而言乎。涉筆至此。不禁感慨系之。</p>
<h3>荔枝瑣談</h3>
<p>— 湯修梅</p>
<p>夏令多佳果。荔枝一物。尤稱雋品。丹實纍纍。遍陳巿肆間。爲値匪昻。銀餅一枚。易可盈筐。去衣殻實水盤中。殊覺瑩潔可愛。啖之。芳留齒頰。甘美多汁。味若瓊漿。浮瓜沉李外。是又一樂事也。荔枝爲喬木之一。樹形團團。一似幃蓋。葉常作青色。經冬不凋。巴峽間產生頗多。閩粤亦有之。顧以川蜀交通遲滯。運致不易。巿上所售者。遂盡爲百粤入閩之品矣。</p>
<p>白樂天於元和十五年謫守川中。作荔枝圖序曾盛譽之。且謂一日而色變。二日而香變。三日而味變。四五日外。則色香味三者盡去。遠道不獲嘗此眞味者。輒加詆毁。負此佳品。因是旣圖其狀。復爲序文申述之。其愛護之意。於此可見。而一經品題。尤覺名貴可珍。處此物質文明之世。輪軌交通。雖已遠非昔比。然亦不免逾此日數耳。</p>
<p>開元遺事。玉環酷嗜此果。中州與產地相去數千里。明皇命馳驛馬星夜兼程以致之。一騎紅塵妃子笑。於是楊妃大樂矣。曲調中復有荔枝香之譜。韻事艷蹟。千古流傳。吾人啖此。每涉遐想。不識與新剝鷄頭相較。味果孰勝。是當質諸李三郎</p>
<h3>遺產與電影</h3>
<p>— 勉如</p>
<p>國中習俗。父產子承。最近女子承繼遺產之權已確定。制度一新。然在國外。則悉視遺囑而定。於是奇聞怪事。層見疊出。或肇爭奪之機。或興殺戳之慘。其爲電影片之資料。。亦已屢見不鮮矣</p>
<p>在我國。遺產更成不祥之物。最近如毘陵盛氏之爭。此仆彼起。而張文卿謀殺庶母一案。亦已轟動遐邇。此外社會新聞中。更時有所見使人懔然知金錢之魔力。蓋足以滅理智而毁情感也。</p>
<p>然黃金之魔力固大。美人之魔力亦不小。財色關頭。一切可驚可愕可感可泣可笑可恨之事。皆以此而興。西方影片中。每述承受遺產之青年男女戀愛故事。往往故佈疑陣。故設危機。使觀衆受無限之刺激而生緊張之情感。若最近西席爾地密爾導演之［犧牲］（Dynamlte）一片。即述一女郎承受遺產之故事。而使人倍覺興奮者也。</p>
<p>余嘗讀［牧羊少年］說部。（商務有譯本）頗喜其情節之複雜離奇。蓋非平舖直叙專以描冩男女間之情愫者可比。其全劇之起點。即由於一女郎之獲得遺產。其中點綴角色。或善。或惡。或妍。或醜。或英勇。或滑稽。而其背景之偉大。尤令讀者如處身域外。而自忘海上之塵囂。當時竊謂苟有人能攝此書而成影片者。必成洋洋大觀也。</p>
<p>今者。明星公司果以攝製是片聞矣。易名爲［桃花湖。］試想千樹天桃。情絲萬疊。揮美人之斧。傷吉士之身。湖上風光。其哀感頑艷爲何如耶。前日。余偶遇是片導演鄭正秋君。爲述攝製是片之經過。頗驚</p>
<h3>東遊心影（一）</h3>
<p>第九届遠東運動大會舉行於日本之東京。由五月二十四日起迄三十日止。大會期凡八日。參觀者逹五十萬人以上。記者奉本館派赴日本。主持採訪大會新聞事宜。得參與盛會。深覺欣幸。記者於五月十三日乘上海丸離滬東渡。六月四日乘龍田丸由神良返國。在日凡二十餘日。經長崎神户大阪而東京。雖以業務所限。未能暢遊彼邦名勝。然耳所聞目所見。已足窺見其社會情形之一斑。年來日本百事突飛猛進。建設力之偉大。即京復興之東京而觀。殊不能不欽佩無已。謹就觀察所得。拉雜書之。聊示不忘云爾。</p>
<h3>（一）上海丸東渡</h3>
<p>五月十三日晨。乘上海丸東渡。是日有日本來華視察團一批亦乘該輪返國。故匯山碼頭送行者甚衆。上海日報社社長波多博君。旅滬近二十載。交友極廣。承到輪觀送。復一一介紹其舟中之素識。盛情至爲可感。晨九時。汽笛一聲。解纜離埠。舟中奏樂。洋洋盈耳。與埠頭之觀呼聲。及船邊之送行五色紙條。随風飄揚。相映成趣。祗知旅行之樂。絲毫未感到别離之苦。而埋首燈下終日奔波之記者生活。亦於是得宣告解放。</p>
<p>日本郵船會社爲國營機關。其航線普及全球。年來復添造巨輪。駛行歐美。淺間丸秩父丸及龍田丸等其尤著者也。行駛神户長崎上海間者日中線快輪。即上海丸長崎丸是。各載重約五千餘噸。每四日開一班。船中佈置極完善。分頭等三等兩種。船價相去約三倍許。頭等又分ＡＢＣ三種。Ａ爲九十五元日金。Ｂ八十五元日金。Ｃ七十五元。船中各處均異常清潔。甲板光可鑑人。即三等艙中亦秩序井然。毫無雜亂狀態。較之其他公司各輪臭氣薰天行道擁塞者眞有天淵之别。頭等艙中尤爲舒適。有圖書室。吸烟室。音樂室等。食事分西洋菜日本菜兩種。均尙可口。晚間則在食堂中開映電影。其樂融融。絶不知身在黃海舟中也。聞日郵船社之中日航線。年虧耗甚巨。以歐美線之盈餘。藉作挹注。日政府對於維持交通。無微不至。反視吾國。瞠乎後矣。</p>
<p>其偉大。聞全劇共攝二十本。以胡蝶女士鄭小秋君等主演。不日即可完成。是則［白雲塔］後。又將見一成功的國產影片矣。炎威方張。願以片中庫倫之雪原景爲嗜影者一滌之也。</p>
<h3>預防霍亂注射談屑</h3>
<p>— 馬蔭良</p>
<p>日來友朋來余處受預防。霍亂注射者甚多。輒詢及醫理。頗饒興味。因濡筆記之。公諸大衆。俾知預防注射毫無危險。且爲避免霍亂之唯一良法也。</p>
<p>㈠注射之時期。以每年五六月間爲最宜。蓋霍亂之蔓延約在七月至九月三個月中。而預防注射之有效期約四五個月。故受預防注射後。可擔保不受霍亂之傳染。</p>
<p>㈡注射後略發微熱。對於身體之健康並無關係。若在下午三四點鐘時注射。則發熱在夜间臨睡時。次日照常工作。毫無影響。</p>
<p>㈢預防注射須施行兩次。時間相隔一星期。苟僅注射一次。則所發出之抵抗力不足。不能收預防之效。</p>
<p>㈣注射用之疫苗往年均用舶來品。近年國人亦有自製者。惟大都仍用外貨。實則疫苗以新鮮爲貴。外國貨轉運來華。自不若本國貨之新鮮。最近上海巿衛生試騐所亦有製品。係採本地病人疫菌。爲效更佳。現歸五洲藥房總經理。余樂用之。并望國人勿以爲非外國貨而鄙視之也。</p>
<p>更正六日所刊翱翔小記。内有中國航空公司特許拍揶滬景一節。查係廣東路三號飛運公司之誤。特此更正。</p>

<p>第十二回别宴離筵拈花留倩影名園嘉會鬭茗覩芳姿後來許多的發起人和幹事。。竟被這位先生說服了。。果然用了萬國兩字。。稱之爲萬國園游會。。雖然所得的羨餘。。是爲慈善救濟用的。。却不居其名。。將來怎樣的支配。。也有個伸縮的餘地。。而且那地方本來是個張氏味蒓園。。用了這園游會三字。。更加適合。。原來那時候正在夏末秋初。。上海那地方。。正閙看夜花園問題。。所謂夜花園是一個什麽東西呢。。在上海離巿一二十里的郊外。。搭一錮蘆蓆棚。。搬去幾十隻檯子。。幾百條椅子。。用一班做大菜做冷食的大司務。。雇一班失業的西崽。。電燈公司的電力逹得到的地方。。門口裝上一串五顏六色的電燈。。便可引人八勝。。規模大一點的。。還有報上登出廣告來。。什麽東莞烟火。。特别奇巧。。還有的雇一班灘簧。。搭起台來。。笙鼓嗷嘈。。絲竹並奏。。其實所謂夜花園者。。旣無可謂花。。亦不成其爲園。。荒郊曠野。。臨時把蘆蓆棚搭起來。。說不定就在荒塜之側。。浮厝之傍。。地上双是個确　不平。。要是一下了雨。。積潦滿地。。完全變了個泥濘世界。。上海的一班蕩子妖姬。。却趨之若鶩。。往往到了夜裹十二點鐘。。便有許多馬車。。魚貫向夜花園進發。。那時候上海的汽車。。還不大流行。。全是馬車的權威。。這班夜花園的人。。和馬車夫都有一種不公開的交涉。。那種交涉。。一言以蔽之。。然是要他的馬車。。運送那班夜裹動物的痴田怨女。。到他們那夜花園來。。要進他的夜花園。。也要買門票。。可是好在每一個馬車夫身邊。。總有一疊門票。。進去非常便利。。這雖然是夏天的天種投機事業。。可也深得上海一般男女的心理。。你想一個永晝爲驕陽所炙。。全靠夜間的凉風。。可以略爲蘇散。。雇了一輛馬車。。至郊外去兜風。。最好是男女兩人。。駢坐情話。。一任那馬蹄得得。。馳入綠陰之幄。。芳草之茵。。他們又喜歡開快馬車。。在閙巿的地方。。佈滿了巡捕。。倘然你開了快馬車。。是要捉到巡捕房裹去的。。他們一至郊外。。絲繮一抖。。那馬便飛軼起塵而去。。因爲郊外是沒有警察的。。在沒有汽車以前的上海。。那這種快馬車。。是大出風頭了。。但是這種夜花園。。每年有人開。。每年總被人反對。。甚而報館記者也做起文章來。。說是有碍衛生。。且傷風化。。於是官廳便出示禁止了。。到官廳出示禁止的時候。。已是秋凉。。就是不禁止也本來要收塲了。。</p>

<p>▲晚市撲朔迷離結果趨跌後市開盤六百Ｏ三兩六錢、嗣因印滙見長、遂低至一兩、零户等買進、且聞印滙易縮、故又穿上三兩餘、爲六百Ｏ四兩半、人後廣帮恒興及福昌源成等均有售出、且銀行對做本月先令六辨士Ｏ六二五八月份一二五、故即下降一四兩、三點後已打破六百兩、旣而空氣尤惡、至三點半跌爲九十六兩五錢一刹時買氣濃厚、更由台灣吸八月英金六辨士一八七五、人心頓堅、風起雲湧、扶搖直上、計抬高六七兩、但倐忽巨變、不可捉摸、乃各號猶亦隨風飃泊、莫明途徑也、迨四點三十分、旋由六百Ｏ三兩五錢收盤、比諸七日續降三兩三錢、</p>

<h3>銀洋市將現酷暑寂况</h3>
<p>▲市塲概况本年金融界夏令市面、較往年不同之點、曾詳前報然昨日形勢、其一種疏懈淡漠之狀態、則又相類似矣、蓋近日洋用方面、客路銷胃停滯、本街需求關於歇夏之商業大都已無所用、僅靠同業中之滙頭交易、殊覺無爲焉、至於銀根鬆滯情形、更乃不成問題、從此銀洋市將人於溽暑怠懈之途耳</p>
<p>▲厘拆價格[洋厘]咋日早午兩市、交易情形、雖仍不弱、而厘價之競爭似已退化、結果兩市價同爲七錢二分五厘二毫半、較前日市况改小二毫半、趨勢將現弱點、恐逐日略有微落之勢、[銀拆]早市七分午市四分、較前日又跌數分、市情清靜、需途寥落、銀行中無掛牌、劃頭遂無加水可言、</p>
<p>▲輔幣市情江南小洋昨略俏利、早市爲六錢二分四厘半、午市爲六錢二分五厘半、兩市間差落一厘、做出交易　早市及午市各二千角、廣東小洋銷途已塞、市價墮落、早市爲六錢Ｏ四厘七毫半、午市爲六錢Ｏ三厘、結果較諸前日早市竟跌二厘有半、做出交易早市九萬五千角、午市一萬五千角、銅元忽又回縮三千文、爲三百八十七千、亦爲上月間以來之最低價、</p>
<p>▲銀洋進出[銀欵]昨日銀行收解、因各方面商業疏懈、遂亦隨之稀少、華商收解票欵一百七八十萬、外商收解票欵一百四十餘萬、各種貨滙税雜諸欵收解八百六七十萬、其他各種特殊收解均無見聞、出倉一百五十萬、日商銀行收解各欵三百四十餘萬、出倉五十萬、錢莊銀公單收解三千五百餘萬、劃頭欵收解三百四五十萬、各路滙欵九十餘萬、收現二百餘萬、都半寄庫、[洋欵]滙劃票欵早市做出一百三十萬、午市做出九十七萬三千、鈔票早市一萬、午市四萬、塲外鈔票早市十一萬五千、午市九萬五千、銀行買賣早市互市四十八萬、午市互市四十萬、各銀行洋户往來收解一百五十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百九十餘萬、鈔票進出一百三四十萬、拆借洋欵一百二十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解四百十餘萬、小錢莊交易六十餘萬、至於客路方面、來源绝跡、而去胃餘廣帮裝去少許新幣外、餘無所聞</p>
<h3>外匯續見鬆動</h3>
<p>▲惟日金增二五　　昨匯豐掛牌、外匯依然勿動、大條雖長、不爲所動、惟銀行内部之價　略有升降、自早見鬆、旋後尤疲、午時轉平午後穏定之勢、至於金價上落甚巨、竟有十兩餘之曲折　迨收市比諸前、（七日）計英金略長零六二五、美金長一二五日金反形提增二五、但無相當買賣、形勢極呆、而華商投機家曾售出英金二十餘萬鎊、兹由台灣·上海·住友·興業·三井·安逹·浙江·中興·等均有吸進、乃買胃尙好、故無特殊變遷聞、有金業中套進條子也、又各行略爲互做數萬鎊、又美金對做十萬元、華商鮮有出納、又日金亦屬沉悶、實缘套頭殊爲不洽、而人心惝恍未定、市氣猶亦盤旋之局焉、</p>
<h3>銀價回長滙市趨鬆</h3>

<p>▲粵帮辦現的興趣尙濃　　紗市晨跌午漲、粵𥉇辦現紗興數尙濃、在市抬價吸收、散户人心多數觀高、因時期正在接近秋銷、而去年七八九三個月市盤飛漲、於是今庚做多者愈衆、然大户仍逢漲抛賣主義、海外花紗市况一致下游、故有一部份心思仍淡、不過實銷目前祖粵帮獨健、其他帮仍無動靜、如影響别帮發展、市面當然有看高之呆能、</p>
<p>▲人標晨跌午漲人標前市開盤、因美棉趨跌、人心平平、各月均跌二·三·四·五錢、午後忽聞棉田私家佔計减少一百餘萬畝、人心驟挺、檯面乾燥、各漲六·七·八至一兩一錢、惟公泰及一部份逢漲抛出、全日成交統計一萬六千三百包、茲將人標收盤價錄左、人標　　收盤漲跌　　賬數　　十月一五七漲五　二九、一００</p>

<h3>今庚國内棉作减色之由來</h3>
<p>▲米價騰貴…兵災匪禍…工作不易　　▲北方西河…略增二成…發良良好　　▲山西亦增…播種適時…棉苗甚佳　　本年國内新棉田以米價騰貴、加之兵匪災禍、因之减少、茲將各地情形略誌如下、甲、上海方面㈠通州棉、南路如金沙長樂等處、棉田約占全面積之七成半、與去年相仿、早花較多、目下在第一次除草工作、中路如馬塘掘港等處、約减百分之十五、發育較南路爲遲、西路如三十里白蒲等處、約减百分之二十、生育狀况與中路相仿、北路如豐利等處、减十之二、發育更遲、東路如麒麟鎭等較减二成、生育較南路略遲、㈡南北市棉、亦較去年减少一二成、生育頗佳、乙、漢口方面、老河口及平漢路一帶、均减一成、家鄉一路减一成半之譜、紗市與去年相仿、播種時期以天雨連綿、較往年遲約半月、發芽狀態則以濕度相宜颇爲良好、惟農人困於匪禍、除草工不作免　　、致雜草　生、影　收成、丙、鄭州方面、以兵匪交攻、情形尙不明暸、棉田减少是又斷言、丁、天津方面、㈠西河一帶、棉田略增、美種花比去年增二成棉苗發育良好㈡御河一帶、棉田則稍减、生育尙佳、㈢山西在過去二年間受大旱災、本年播種時適逢甘霖、棉田增加、而棉苗發育亦極良好云、</p>
<h3>糧食　米市貨稀益靜</h3>
<p>▲閘北昨日河下見抵米船一隻、氖登記存粳已斛竣、故此間白粳已無市况、薄稻亦千斷、羊秈徴有應市、其數不足百石、價因洋米見軟帶疲、現各廠棧機尖屬幾無、大都、經售西貢小絞矣、變元河存共計七八百石之譜、市銷不旺、價無榮無辱、普通仍開十九元左右、</p>
<p>▲滬南裹路見到同里粳一號、白元數號、各米店進意不貪、惟迥來普通機粳標準二十一元、隨到隨空、杜子秈等已連日未到、市勎大靜、白元吊胃見爽、本街亦擇高購辦、行情因來源尙接、故仍平平、價開十九元關口、客貨批别三四角不等、</p>

<h3>期麥軟落三四分</h3>
<p>昨日麥市開市後、各月份一致下跌　二盤收盤復漒、下午繼跌、市上有三五分之出入、蓋因各路來源被阻之消息傅出後、市面早有變化、乃販户趁此上漲之機會、盡力搜索、或兼程抵埠、或预定洋船、昨日已有長江貨一大批到埠、復有大批预定期日可到、販户除兜售現貨外、又向所中抛出期貨、致市價開市即小、　因空頭抵購轉好、　被淨咒抛出復跌收市七月小三分、八月至十二月各小四分、昨現麥到貨尙旺、且有预行抛售路貨、致廠家變計觀望、擯不收受、市面立見軟疲、統市售開不、满五千包、價小數分、計明光麥一百五十包、價四兩八錢二分、　麥二百包、價四兩九錢、沙市漢口等麥三千包、價四兩八錢半至四兩八錢、窑　徐州儀徴等麥各一車、價四兩八錢半至四兩七錢、由禍新等購去云、</p>
<h3>標準荳餅見空前高價</h3>
<p>昨標準期餅市大佳、緣大連産電旣昂、而本埠現銷尤暢、兼原料黄豆到價升、成本加重、各油厰觀望扳售、而内地温台·寗·帮因　銷關係、祇得放盤暢進、於是標準近期况飛漲四分之鉅、開出七月上期二兩一錢、七月下期二兩０九分、此等盤面實屬空前、公會沙河大連本廠等現貨邊餅光餅、亦同逹二兩一錢左右矣、</p>

<h3>南北貨　新野山枝已開通</h3>
<p>▲上檔國又升二兩　　前日所到之橷野山枝、昨聞北市各廣帮號家已次第開出、貨品較高者開十七兩二錢　次之十六兩許至十五兩左右、如數兌通、新漳枝因不及、定今日再開、上檔桂圓以日見稀缺、颇覺勁俏、昨開出數十箱比之前市又升二兩、竟超出行盤之上云、</p>
<h3>茹粉飛漲略定</h3>
<p>茹粉以到貨不多、内銷颇暢、價逐步飛升、號盤雖有續開、數皆不多、統手貨最高價升至十兩O一錢、上檔貨均斷、號方有索價十一兩以上、去電採辦之說、市氣鋒芒、實所罕觀、昨日武昌開連祇數百包　惟仍以萧合興·偉興·及益興等、統手貨居多、萧合興及偉興及偉興昨開百餘包、價元十兩O六錢、市象已見定勎云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　蘇屬夏繭收成奇歉</h3>
<p>▲純受天時損害…統扯祇一成餘　　蘇屬江寗·鎭江·蘇州·無錫·常州·及宜·溧金·丹·各縣農民、因官廰與絲商之勸導類均補育夏　、奈天時不正、一再發生劇變、蠶蛾備受損害、走失十之八九、現雖新繭次第上市、而繭産統扯祇有一成餘、且繭質不佳、絲繭商咸抱悲觀、、各屬蠶户莫不呌苦云</p>

<h3>川湘路政觀察談</h3>
<p>— 偉業</p>
<p>［中華交通素稱閉塞　幸年來對於道路建設頗著成績　原有之崎嶇小徑　現多變爲康莊大道　……沿海東岸與西北邊界交通現在漸可聯絡　……］此美國商務委員史密斯女士　在聯太平洋會席上所發之言論也　按聯太平洋會於上月二十七日開聚餐會蒞會者多中外名人如外交部長王正廷博士　及美商務委員史女士等均有演說　史女士最近會週遊川湘等省　對於該兩省之道路狀况　考察研究　頗爲詳晰　爰將演词繹述於後　俾供留心路政者之参考焉</p>
<p>湘路現狀　湖南面積约佔八萬三千方里　人口约有四千萬　以洞庭湖周圍及沿江一帶最爲稠密　與鄰省交通多由陸路聯络　迴溯築路之始　尙在十年前　首成之路　即現在之長沙湘潭綫　計長三十哩　寛二十五呎　路基甚固路面亦堅飬路法合　常能保持善狀　所有橋梁建築甚佳堅固耐久　通車已逾五年　營業極形發達　自長沙至湘潭　乘長途汽車僅需一小時又五分鐘</p>
<p>萬國振災委員會湖面分會　曩會收到美國捐欵五十萬元　於一九二二及一九二三年間　着手築一上等道路　自湘潭之西起　經湘陰　永豊　迄寳慶止　共長一百一十哩此路頗多高斜之石橋　所有工程材料俱臻上乘　允稱[模範道路]</p>
<p>關於路政之設施　現由三個機關分區主持　一切設計施工各負其責　去歳八月湖南省政府核准以一百五十萬元爲築路經費　並議决所有行駛省道之長途汽車事務　均由省政府集中管理之　釐訂車資酌减數目　以便行旅　而汽車照會費則按定章加增</p>
<p>湘省政府復於去歲十月　將全省所裁之兵　移作建築道路及修理鐡路之用　以符化兵爲工之政策　且爲促進計畫實施起見　呈明中央編遺委員會及鐡道部　擬以四十萬元即時興築湘省南部之武岡綏寗路</p>
<p>綜觀湘省現在已成之汽車咱　計長三百八十九哩　關度一律二十四呎　路面均用碎石鋪築　頗稱完好，尙有八百五十三哩正在建築中，此外更擬增築一千二百七十哩　預定四年内完成</p>
<p>川路現狀　川省交通不便　素有[蜀道難]之稱　近則道路日漸開拓　交通漸見改良　當一九二三年楊森治川時　先着手於省會街道之放寛　最先修治者爲東大路　當時頗有一部分人反對　攻擊楊森甚烈　而楊持以毅力　不爲所動　卒底於成　自該路拓寛後　商業鋭興　市面日盛　於是其他街市執有産業之商民　均望而歆羡　咸自動的讓出餘地放寛道路以與競爭　因此競爭之結果　東大路之商民復將街市再爲擴充　以期保持固有之優越地位　前後心理不同如此　迨一九二六年成都市街泰半放寛　而其經費則多出於屋主　可見利之所在　成事自易自成都通逹各縣之道路　支幹甚繁　多在建築中　最要者爲成渝路　計長三百哩預算修築費至少需銀四百萬元　將來完成後爲由揚子流域入川之要道　長途汽車一日即到　自前年夏間即已動工　工作期間　障礙滋多　現雖經繼續進行　究竟何時完成　尙不可預料也</p>
<p>在合州寗遂區域内　街道亦已放寛至三十呎　路身爲碎石塊塡築　路面用石灰三合土铺成　新路縱横　交通極便</p>
<p>劍州更有寛而極好之街市　屋宇亦多改良新建者　氣象繁盛　一望而知</p>
<p>總計四川全省已成之汽車路　約計一千二百哩　普通寛度均在二十五呎至三十呎間　現在多屬泥路　但將來必遂漸改爲堅固之石路　可斷言也</p>

<h3>皖省汽車傷人處理方案</h3>
<p>— 悟非</p>
<p>安徽公路管理處鑒於全省路政之日益開關　公共汽車之應用尤繁　而傷人肇禍　日有所聞　殊非所以利便行旅　爰訂汽車傷人處理章程十一條　嚴其罰則　綢繆未雨　可謂極端泩意路政之安全矣　揆其章程内容所有方案　對於汽車傷人　共分五項　（一)汽車傷人之過失　(二)被傷害人之疏忽　(三)被傷害人之故意(四)不可避免之意外事件(五)其他事項　茲分述之</p>
<p>屬於汽車人之過失者有五（一）汽車駛出車道幅以外（二）汽車倒退　成必須超越前面車輛　不嗚喇叭示警而肇禍者　（三）汽車於下坡或轉灣時　不鳴喇叭示警　因而肇禍者　（四）汽車經過人民通行之街道或交叉路　或前面有與汽車同方向之行人　以及人烟稠密之處　不鳴喇叭示警　因而肇禍者　（五）司機人違犯行車規則　交通規則　或司機服務規則　因而肇禍者　凡此皆爲司機人應負其責　故由於汽車司機人之過失致傷人者　除司機人應負之刑事責任　由法院辦理外　其受傷輕微者　给五元以下醫藥費　重傷者给五十元以一醫藥費　致殘疾者除给五十元以下之醫藥費外　另給賙恤費一百元因傷致死者　加給葬埋費　一百五十元　或</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>二百元。</p>
<p>▲對於被傷害人之疏忽者有五。㈠行人在公路車道幅内停留·及聞汽車喇叭示警。並不避讓。因而肇禍者。㈡駕駛其他車輛。不循規定道幅。或違背交通規則。以致互撞。因而肇禍者。㈢行人在近行街道。歟汽車相向行或同向行。聞喇叭示警。不知避讓或左右奔跑。因而肇禍者。㈣於汽車行動時。上車或下車。因而肇禍者。㈤在車站或其他交通地點。阴碍汽車前進。聞喇叭示警。不急行避讓。因而肇禍者。在此種情况之下。胥爲由於被傷害人之自已疏忽。故無論傷害之輕重。或致死亡。得由公路管理處酌量情形。給予差等之醫藥費。或埋葬費等。</p>
<p>▲對於被傷害人之故意者有四。㈠行人於車道幅内。有突礙阻擋汽車之行爲。或聞迭吹喇叭示警。並不避避讓。因而肇禍者。㈡行人於汽車已鳴喇叭。將駛人交叉路時。而突然横過。或故意駛行横過。因而肇禍者。㈢因攀登汽車。或在汽車側近及前後競走游戲。因而肇禍者。㈣其他藉汽車自殺者。於此情形之下。其爲被傷害人之故意可知。故無論傷害之輕重。公路管理處。概不給予醫藥费。僅因故意而致死亡。得酌量略給埋葬费以示優恤而已。</p>
<p>▲屬於不可避免之意外故障者有二。㈠汽軍機件。於中途發生意外之損壤。致車身出險。因而肇禍者。㈡遇不可預測之意外故障。司機人對車輌無法抗制。因而肇禍者。若由不可避免之意外故障。因而致傷或死亡者。悉依汽車司機人過失例辦理。</p>

<h3>納喜旅非遇險記</h3>
<p>— 吉人</p>
<p>美洲最早汽車旅行之情形。可於韋廉葛雷籐將軍致納喜車廠之電報内推測之。韋氏者乃一著名之非洲探險與運動家也。會採購一新納喜雙發火六缸轎車。周游非洲西部。地多山嶺　荒蕪無徑。計行一萬一千英里。與最初美洲汽車旅行之情形無異。</p>

<h3>Hundred-Volume Twenty-Four Histories</h3>
<p>The ancients said that books are valued for their first editions because their errors are fewer. The Hundred-Volume edition specifically selects old Song and Yuan editions, which embodies this idea. Except for the old Five Dynasties History and the Ming History, which still use the Qing edition, the remaining twenty-two histories are all old editions, sufficient to correct countless errors in the palace editions. A sample page is respectfully attached and printed for your review and correction.</p>
<p>Empress Yongtai was fond of Huang-Lao teachings and belittled the Five Classics. Therefore, she wanted to stop the memorial presentations to the empress dowager. The empress dowager was angry, so she ordered the execution of those who promoted this. All the things she had established were abolished. Six years later, Empress Dowager Dou died. In the following year, the emperor recruited literary scholars, including Gongsun Hong. In the following year, the emperor first went to Yong to perform sacrifices at the Five Altars. Zheng Yi said that the Sun Altar is pronounced "Zhi." The "Kuo Di Zhi" says that the Five Emperors Altars of the Han dynasty were located south of Yong County in Qizhou. Meng Kang said that the altar is where the spirits reside, or where the God of the Sun resides in Yong County, Yong Prefecture. Meng Kang said that the altar is where the spirits of the gods reside. According to the records, the Five Altars are the Fu Altar, the Mi Altar, the Wuyang Altar, the North Altar. Initially, Duke Wen built the Fu Altar to sacrifice the White Emperor. Duke Xuan of Qin built the Mi Altar to sacrifice the Green Emperor. Duke Ling of Qin built the upper and lower Altars of Wuyang to sacrifice the Red and Yellow Emperors. Emperor Gaozu of the Han Dynasty built the North Altar to sacrifice the Black Emperor. These are the Five Altars. Later, sacrifices were usually performed in the suburbs every three years. At this time, the emperor sought the Divine Lady. Zheng Yi said that the story of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty tells of a cypress-dyed platform built to house the Divine Lady, who was a woman from Changling. Before this, she had been married and had a son who died at a few years old. The woman grieved deeply and died within the year. Her spirit appeared to be still present, and when she was worshipped, she was said to speak. The woman seemed to be alive. Many people sought her blessings and her predictions about family matters were often accurate. Lord Pingyuan also worshipped her. Later, her descendants became noble and wealthy. When the emperor ascended the throne, the empress dowager invited her to the palace to worship her. She heard her voice but did not see her person. At this time, the Divine Lady sought to leave, and the Cypress Beam Terrace was built to house her. Initially, when Huo Qubing was insignificant, he prayed to the Divine Lady. When he saw her form, he adorned himself and wanted to have relations with her. Huo Qubing refused and said to the Divine Lady, "I fast and pray because I believe you are pure and clean. Now you want to be licentious, which is not right." He broke off contact and never went again. The Divine Lady was ashamed and left. She was housed in the Shanglin Garden, at the Ti clan pavilion. Xu Guang said the sound of Ti is "Tee". ○ So</p>

<p>The emperor is the Five Altars. Later, sacrifices were usually performed in the suburbs every three years. At this time, the emperor sought the Divine Lady and housed her in the Shanglin Garden, at the Ti clan pavilion. Jiejie (Collected Explanations), Xu Guang said the sound of Ti is "Tee", Suo Zou Dan Sheng pronunciation Si, Guan is also the name. The Divine Lady was obtained from Changling. Because her son died, she was sad, so she appeared to the divine spirit before and after, Wanruo. Jiejie, Meng Kang said that she gave birth and died. Brothers' wives called each other Wanruo. Suo Zou Dan Xian pronunciation, before and after is the branch sound, which is the current sister-in-law. Wei Zhao said the sound of Xian is "Yuan", Xian is the first aunt, and Hou is the younger aunt. Worship Wanruo in her house. Many people go to worship her, and Lord Pingyuan goes to worship her. Jiejie, Xu Guang said the emperor Wu's maternal grandmother. According to Cai Yong's words, a woman with a different surname who was granted nobility due to grace is called a Lord and is comparable to a princess. Suo Xu said the emperor Wu's maternal grandmother, which is her majestic sight. Later, her descendants were honored and prominent. When Emperor Wu ascended the throne, he gave generous gifts and placed her in the ancestral hall. He heard her words but did not see her person. It is said that inside the hall was also Li Shaojun, who also used tortoise sacrifices and the Dao of Gu to meet the old ways. Jiejie, Li Qi said to eat the Dao of Gu and lead or reject the food. Suo Jie, Ru Chun said worshipping the tortoise can bring blessings. According to the rituals, tortoises are sacrificed by old women in abundance in pots and respect in a saying. Shuo Wen Zhou Rituals use tortoises to worship Zhurong. Huainanzi said Emperor Yan was a fire official who died and became the current tortoise god. Sima Biao commented on Zhuangzi saying that tortoise is a god of vastness. Like a beautiful woman in red, Li Kefan.</p>

<h3>Compilation of Military Reports from Various Sides</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Nanjing Garrison Department announced on the 8th, summarizing telegrams from various sides: (1) The rebel Shi launched a full-scale attack from the east, from the direction of the old Kaocheng, recklessly attacking our right flank in an attempt to make a final struggle. They were ultimately defeated by our army on the Jiang night. Their reinforcements, Zhang Yinxiang's troops, were also routed. After cleaning up the battlefield, over 3,000 enemy officers and soldiers abandoned, wounded, and killed were found. Dozens of senior officers were among them. The strength of the rebel can be said to have been completely eliminated. After hearing the news of Shi's collapse, Sun Lianzhong's troops, which were dispatched by the rebel Feng as the second wave of reinforcements, hurriedly fled back without daring to advance. After suffering this severe blow, the rebel enemy's strength was sharply reduced, and their morale was shattered. The end of a spent arrow is truly not worth a blow. The Longhai Line is no longer a problem. The capture of Bian and Luo is just around the corner. (2) After the Liu and Ren armies were defeated by us at Zhaoji and Zoucheng, they led their remnants to retreat north of Xihua. (3) The rebel Liu Ruming used bandit troops such as Xue Decheng and others in a desperate attempt to launch a fierce attack on our army at Congzaihekou. They were completely defeated by our army along the entire line, capturing many. The bandit Liu only led his pistol guards to flee towards Xichuan. Our army is currently pursuing them in separate directions. (4) One of our units launched an attack from the Pinggang area and occupied the Qin-kou, Fengpu-miao, Ji-genglou, and Shazhuang lines, seizing many enemy guns and dozens of warhorses. They are still advancing. (5) The remaining troops of the bandit Ma Xiren in the Wei-gang and Ya-shi areas are currently surrounded by our army. (6) The remaining troops of the rebel Feng in Taikang have been driven out by our army, and our army has occupied Taikang. (8th Daily Telegram)</p>
<h3>Sino-American Aviation Contract</h3>
<p>Formally Signed Yesterday</p>

Those attending from the Chinese side were Company Chairman Wang Boqun, as well as Vice Minister of Communications Wei Yifu, Postal Director Liu Shufan, Postal Aviation Section Chief Li Jiacong, etc. Those attending from the American side were company representative Bolin, and his secretaries and staff, etc. They signed two formal contracts, two postal transport agreements between the company and the Directorate General of Posts, and other attachments. The content of the contract, after both parties' agreement, will not be released until it has been approved by the Chinese National Government and passed by Boeing's (US) headquarters. However, it is rumored that the main points, such as the investment amounts of both parties and the organization of the board of directors, are equivalent to the contents of the Sino-German aviation contract, adhering to the principle of not violating China's economic sovereignty.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Political Tides in England and Japan</h3>
<p>The Conservative Party in England is attacking the Labor government using economic policy, anticipating overthrowing it in July. The Seiyukai Party in Japan is attacking the current government due to austerity measures, believing it must be overthrown. Both the English and Japanese governments are currently being opposed by opposition parties who have found cause for opposition, and that cause is economic problems, the problem of commercial decline. Although one is for the economic unification of the British Empire, and the other is due to the Japanese government's austerity measures, the underlying cause is the stagnation of commercial markets, either for remedy or due to resentment. The reality is the same.</p>
<p>For countries founded on industry and commerce, the first thing to be affected by a commercial decline is the economy. After being affected, they will inevitably seek to remedy the situation. If the remedy is ineffective, the opposition party will inevitably use this to attack the inadequacy of the policies. Therefore, when economic problems arise, the political tides in the country will inevitably rise along with them. The more intense the economic changes, the more intense the political tides in the country will become. This is because people, when faced with difficulties, often think of trying a new method to resolve their troubles. Regardless of whether the method is effective or not, they believe that trying it is better than not trying it at all. Therefore, the opposition party's opposition often succeeds as a result. However, the global trend of commercial decline has become an irreversible force for the time being. Even if the opposition party succeeds and comes to power, its policies may not be effective, and they may only serve as resources for other parties in the future. Therefore, if the global economic world remains unstable for a long time, the political tides in various countries will inevitably rise and fall without settling.</p>

<p>International News</p>
<p>European Union Plan</p>
<h3>Content of Italian Reply</h3>
<p>Polite Wording Implies Opposition</p>
<p>Advocates Inclusion of Russia and Turkey</p>
<p>Equal Treatment for All Countries, Regardless of Strength</p>
<p>Rome, Seventh (National News Agency) The Italian Government's Reply to Briand's Federal Plan was Delivered to the French Charge d'Affaires on Saturday. The Full Text was Published in Italian Newspapers Today, Expressing Opposition in Polite Wording. The Content is Divided into Three Parts. The First Section Requires the Abolition of All Discrimination Against Defeated Countries, and All Countries, Whether Victorious or Defeated, Strong or Weak, Should Enjoy Equal Rights and Guarantee Absolute Independence and Sovereignty. In Addition, Russia and Turkey Should Also be Invited to Join in Order to Meet the Purpose of Briand's Plan. The Second Section Discusses the Relationship Between the European Union and Countries Outside Europe and the League of Nations, Stressing That the World-in-One, Interdependent View Generated by the League of Nations Should Not be Lost, as this Would Cause Fear. Furthermore, After the European Nations Organize a Group, Other Countries Will Inevitably Follow Suit and Form Groups, and the Organic Unity of the League of Nations Will Be in Danger of Destruction. Therefore, Italy Does Not Approve of Organizations Such as the Council and Executive Yuan of the League of Nations, and Advocates That All Countries in the European Union Should Have Equal Speaking Rights and Representation. The Final Section Does Not Approve of Briand's Theory That the European Union Must be Based on Solving the Security Problem, and Declares That the Purpose of Such a Union Must Coincide with the League of Nations, and There is No Two-Fold Security. Although Briand's Plan Does Not Directly or Indirectly Mention This Level, According to the Italian Government's Opinion, This is Actually an Attempt to Create a Starting Point for the Spiritual Cooperation of the European Nations.</p>
<p>Paris News, The Governments of 26 European Countries Must Reply to French Foreign Minister Briand's European Union Proposal by July 15. The Little Entente, Namely the Three Countries of Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia, Recently Consulted and Decided to Support Briand's Proposal. Denmark and Spain Also Expressed Their Support. Switzerland Also Generally Agrees, But With Significant Reservations. Germany Has Also Conveyed Its Views to Briand. The Obstacles to the Full Realization of the European Union Proposal are the Conflicts in Franco-Italian Relations and German-Polish Relations (World).</p>
<p>Germany and France</p>
<h3>Saar Negotiations Stalled</h3>
<p>France Demands Joint Coal Mining</p>
<p>German Press Does Not Agree</p>
<p>Paris, Seventh (National News Agency) The Saar Issue Between France and Germany Has Now Been Suspended. A Joint Communiqué was Issued by the Two Parties' Committees, and the Committee Acknowledged that the Two Governments Shared Widely Divergent Opinions on a Certain Issue of Fundamental Importance to National Interests, and Therefore Had to Suspend Negotiations So That the Two Governments Could Weigh and Consider Whether to Reopen Negotiations This Autumn.</p>
<p>Berlin, Seventh (National News Agency) The German Press Expressed Regret Over the Breakdown of the Saar Issue Negotiations. It is Now Believed That the Current Impasse is Due to France's Demand for Joint French-German Coal Mining in the Saar, Because the German Committee Has Always Insisted During the Negotiations That the Mine Was Originally German State Property Before Being Temporarily Conceded to France According to the Treaty, So the German Government Has the Right to Redeem it at a Favorable Price, But It Also Expressed its Willingness to Guarantee to Sell Coal to France on Time in the Future, Because it is Indispensable for the Lorraine Iron Industry. At Present, the German Political Circles Hope to Find a Way Out, But It is Expected That Its Solution Will Be Very Difficult or Will Be Left to 1935, When the Citizens' Assembly Will Vote on a Public Resolution on Whether the Land Belongs to Germany or France in Accordance with the Treaty.</p>
<h3>Political Upheaval Brewing in Britain</h3>
<p>Bankers' Declaration Forms New Situation</p>
<p>Economic Policy Will Be the Fuse</p>
<p>London, Seventh (Reuters) The Declaration on Imperial Free Trade Published by Bankers on July 3 Has Created a New Political Situation. After the Minister of Agriculture Backsden Was Granted a Knighthood, the Seat He Left Behind in the House of Commons Will Soon be Filled by a By-Election. At This Time, All Parties are Using the Issue of Imperial Free Trade as the Main Point of Contention in the Election. The Contestants are Backsden's Wife for the Labor Party and Cooke for the Conservative Party. Both Sides Have Been Exerting Their Arguments in the Constituency. Cooke is Enthusiastic About Imperial Free Trade and is Deeply Supported by Sir Beaverbrook. At the End of Last Week, Sir Beaverbrook Gave a Speech, Saying That the Bankers' Declaration Had Caused a Great Revolution and Made the Conservative Party Tend to Unity. Now the Conservative Party Has Adopted Imperial Free Trade. British Foreign Secretary Henderson Also Gave a Speech to Refute Sir Beaverbrook's Theory, Saying That Sir Beaverbrook's Claim That 200 Labor Party Members Were About to Leave the Party and Tend to Imperial Free Trade Was Completely Baseless. At the Same Time, Naval Minister Alexandria and Works Minister Mrs. Pondfield Also Spoke to Campaign for Mrs. Backsden. Conservative Party Leader Baldwin Sent a Letter to Cooke, Roughly Saying That Although Cooke's Views Were Not Entirely the Same as the Conservative Party's Formal Platform, They Were the Same in Striving for Imperial Economic Unity, So He Wished Him Success. Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden Said That Only Half of Those Who Signed the Declaration Were Bankers, and It Was Rash to Claim to Represent the Views of the Financial Community. The Daily Mail Reported That the Conservative Party Intended to Overthrow the Government in July So That It Could Control the Imperial Conference. The Political Upheaval May Occur Next Week Because the Minister of Works, Mrs. Pondfield, Will Submit a Proposal at That Time to Increase the Borrowing Power of Unemployment Insurance to 70 Million Pounds. The Liberal Party May Join the Opposition This Time, Which is Also Unknown. If So, the Government's Proposal Will Fail and the Only Option Will be to Resign.</p>
<p>London, Seventh (Reuters) The Political Parties in the Lower House Will Soon Debate on Closer Economic Policies Within the Empire. Today the Conservative Party Baldwin and Others Have Proposed an Impeachment Case Advocating (1) Defending the Domestic Market (2) Expanding Export Trade to Overseas Territories with Reciprocal Trade Contracts (3) Levying Taxes on Foreign Food to Ensure That British Manufacturers and Farmers Can Obtain Equal Benefits in the Imperial and Other Markets. The Date of the Debate Has Not Yet Been Determined.</p>
<p>US Senate Convenes Special Meeting</p>
<h3>Consider the London Naval Treaty</h3>
<p>Hoover Presents His Views</p>
<p>Urges Early Adoption</p>
<p>Washington, Seventh (Associated Press) The Senate Convened a Special Meeting Today to Resolve the London Naval Treaty. The Number of People Attending Was Sufficient for a Quorum. The Concern of Those Who Support the Treaty That There Would be a Walkout Has Now Been Dispelled. After the Meeting Began, Vice President Curtis, in His Capacity as Chairman of the Senate, Appointed Two Committee Members to Report to President Hoover That the Senate Special Meeting Had Been Convened and to Request Him to Present the Opinions He Wanted to State. After the Senate Read President Hoover's Opinion Letter, It Read the Full Text of the Naval Treaty. Then Senator McKellar Proposed a Case Requesting the President to Submit All Documents Regarding the Treaty to the Senate for Review. After a Moment of Verbal War Between Senators Supporting and Opposing the Treaty, the Meeting Was Adjourned and Scheduled for Tomorrow to Consider McKellar's Proposal.</p>
<p>Washington, Seventh (Associated Press) President Hoover's Opinions on the Naval Treaty Presented to the Senate Special Meeting are as Follows: 1. If the Senate Fails to Pass the Treaty, It Will Undermine the World's Trend Towards Peace. 2. The Steps to Decide on Passing the Treaty Should be Expedited. 3. The Text of the Treaty Has Been Discussed in Detail for a Long Time, So There is No Need to Delay its Progress by Pretending to Consider it. 4. The Text of the Treaty Encompasses All of America's Responsibilities. 5. Military Personnel in Various Countries Oppose This Treaty Everywhere, While the American Public Unanimously Supports This Treaty. Finally, It Describes the Content of the Treaty, Saying That It is Sufficient to Protect the Interests and Doctrine of the United States, and That Today's Question is Not About a Few Cruisers, But About Whether There Should Be This Treaty. Without the London Naval Treaty, It Will Inevitably Promote Unlimited Naval Competition.</p>
<h3>Finnish Anti-Red Movement</h3>
<p>Strong Religious Tone</p>
<p>Petitioning Massively in the Capital</p>
<p>Helsinki, Seventh (National News Agency) Anti-Red Activists From All Over Are Continuously Arriving in the Finnish Capital. The Number of Cars in the Suburbs is More Than 1,300. After Arriving in the Suburbs, They Get Out of the Cars and March in Formation Towards the Designated Venue. The Process is Silent and Orderly. Their Demonstration Has a Religious Tone. First, the Leaders Lay Wreaths at the Tombs of Soldiers Who Died in Battle Against Russia, and Then Hold Open-Air Prayers. A Large Number of People Participate, and They Simultaneously Publish a Fundamental Plan to Petition the Government. The Most Important of Their Demands is to Ban All Communist Organizations and to Exclude Communist Elements From All Associations and Public Offices. These Two Items are Expected to be Accommodated by the New Cabinet. Other Demands May be Rejected, Especially Regarding the Reform of the Parliament and the Electoral System, and the Restriction of Freedom of Speech in Newspapers, Because the Liberal and Social Democratic Factions Believe That They Excessively Change the Constitution. In Short, The Next Few Days Will be the Most Important Time for the Future of the Finnish Nation and Its Political and Social Life.</p>
<p>Helsinki, Seventh (National News Agency) The Massive Petitioning of More Than 20,000 Anti-Red Farmers Has Allowed the Anti-Red Movement to Achieve a Complete Victory. Their Leader Met With the President Today. President Rylander Praised Them Greatly for Their Loyalty and Patriotism, and Agreed to Prohibit All Communist Propaganda, Improve the Election Law, and Abolish the Proportional Representation System So That Communists Could No Longer Enter Parliament. Now the Whole City is Full of Flags and Banners to Express Welcome. Most of These People Come From the Lapland Region in the Northwest of Finland, Which is the Source of the National Rights Movement With a Strong Religious Tone. In Recent Months, They Have Repeatedly Carried Out Anti-Red Demonstrations, Which Have Caused Many Acts of Violence. Therefore, Finns Also Call This Anti-Red Movement the Lapland Movement. At Present, the Streets of the Finnish Capital are Full of Laplanders, All Wearing Ordinary Work Clothes and Wearing a Special Dark Blue Badge. However, They Can Still Maintain Order. Now That the Finnish Government Can Accommodate Their Demands, It Is Expected That It Will Not Lead to Accidents.</p>
<p>Rhine Region</p>
<h3>Anti-Separatist Riot</h3>
<p>French Ambassador to Germany Writes Letter of Protest</p>
<p>German Press Believes It is Undermining Unity</p>
<p>Berlin, Seventh (National News Agency) The French Ambassador to Berlin Suddenly Wrote a Letter to Foreign Minister Curtius Today Regarding the Anti-Separatist Riot in the Rhine Region, Saying That in the French Government's Opinion, This Kind of Disturbance is Undermining the Treaty Concluded at the Hague Under the Young Plan. The German Government Side Had Earlier Debated This Matter and Had Repeatedly Stated That All Local Authorities Had Done Their Best to Protect the Leaders and Supporters of the Separatist Movement, and All Newspapers Had Unanimously Refrained From Attacking Those Who Opposed the Movement. However, When the Treaty Was Concluded at the Hague, the German Side Only Acknowledged That It Would Not Prosecute Separatist Personnel for Rebellion. It is Reported That Foreign Minister Curtius Explained to the French Ambassador the Reason Why the People of the Rhine Region Hated the Separatist Personnel, Saying That the Fact is Related to Psychological Effects. Just Recall the Suffering That the Residents of the Region Suffered When the Faction Repeatedly Wanted to Undermine German Unity. The Berlin Newspapers All Criticized the Document Submitted by the French Ambassador This Time as Being Inappropriate, and in Terms of Psychological Concepts, There Were Many Flaws, Because the French Ambassador's Attitude Easily Misled People Into Believing That the French Side Still Insisted on Its Policy of Secretly Assisting Those Who Undermine German Unity.</p>
<h3>Unrest Within Turkish Territory</h3>

<p>Public Opinion Extremely Indignant</p>
<p>Angora dispatch from the National Society on the 7th: Public opinion in the Turkish capital is extremely indignant regarding Persia's secret assistance to the rebel Kul tribe in the Alala region, which has led to continuous bloody battles.

Furthermore, according to private sources, the number of rebels exceeds ten thousand, all well-equipped and battle-hardened.

<h3>Britain Seeks to Restore Trade with China</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London on the 7th: Labor Party Member of Parliament, Mr. Davies, questioned the government in the House of Commons today about what measures it will take to help British businesses restore their trade in China. Mr. Gillett, Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Commerce, replied that, in addition to sending an economic mission to the Far East, Dutch East Indies...</p>
<h3>Request for Equal Legal Treatment</h3>
<p>Batavia Correspondence: Our overseas Chinese compatriots are often oppressed by imperialism and rarely receive equal legal treatment. Currently, Mr. Yang, a member of the Dutch East Indies National Assembly in Batavia, has raised this issue for questioning. The Dutch East Indies government has given the following clear response: [The claim that overseas Chinese face various difficulties in criminal litigation procedures, preventing equal legal treatment, and that the realization of such treatment will be indefinitely delayed is not true. Although there are indeed some difficulties, they will be removed after careful preparation. A proposal to apply the criminal litigation procedures for white people to overseas Chinese has been submitted by the Ministry of Justice to the Supreme Court for review. The reason for the non-implementation of equal treatment on January 1st of this year is that the Chinese government's family law has not yet been implemented. If there are no major financial obstacles, it can certainly be implemented in 1932.]</p>
<h3>Report on the Situation in India</h3>
<p>Opening Ceremony of the Indian Council</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London on the 7th: The Secretary of State for India read in the House of Commons today the Viceroy of India's report on the situation in India last week. It stated briefly that the internal situation on the Northwest Frontier continues to improve rapidly. Representatives from various classes recently met with officials in the North-West Frontier Province to present constructive proposals for the development of local autonomy. The officials responded favorably and it is expected that measures to improve the administrative efficiency of the Northwest Frontier Province will be available soon. Since Nehru's imprisonment, boycotts have occurred in various places, but they are not comprehensive and have not led to conflicts between officials and the people. The non-violent resistance movement is gradually giving way to the idea that it cannot succeed, and efforts to resolve India's political problems through constitutional means are gradually increasing. Muslims are currently considering carefully their opinions to be presented at the upcoming round table conference in London.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London on the 8th: The new office of the Secretary of State for India, named the Indian Council, was officially opened today by the King of England. His speech earnestly urged the people of India and Great Britain to be friendly with each other and to create peace. It is reported that the cost of building the office was £324,000.</p>

<h3>Naval Chiefs Continue Meeting</h3>
<p>Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 8th: The meeting of the four naval chiefs continued yesterday afternoon at the official residence of the Minister of the Navy. The Minister of Finance, Taniguchi, Okada, Kato, and other admirals attended. The Chief of Naval General Staff, Taniguchi, explained the results of the research conducted on the morning of the 7th regarding the following issues on which consensus had not been reached the previous day: 1. Whether the naval strength stipulated in the London Treaty poses a threat to national defense. 2. If there are shortcomings, how to make up for them. 3. The Navy's policy for the next conference. Admiral Kato also expressed his understanding of Chief of Naval General Staff Taniguchi's sincerity. It was then decided to hold an informal meeting after the opening of the Privy Council. The meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM.</p>
<p>Electric News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 8th: The Privy Council is paying close attention to the government's attitude toward consulting the naval treaty. If the Chief of Naval General Staff and the Minister of the Navy take responsibility for guaranteeing the safety of national defense, it will naturally be approved. However, since former Minister Kato has resigned, if the government does not change its relationship with the military and adopts the consultation procedure, the Privy Council is quite reluctant out of caution. Some Privy Council members advocate a tough stance and will first question the government as to why it did not consult the military authorities about the naval treaty to dispel doubts, using the lack of a complete consultation procedure as a reason to refuse examination until an agreement is reached with the military.</p>
<h3>Local Advocacy Conference: The Seiyukai Party Criticizes the Current Cabinet</h3>

Next, Kunitoshi Tsugumo took the stage and said that if the movement to overthrow the cabinet is suppressed, he would fight as the Showa version of Go'ro Sakura, but he was ordered to stop by the police, and the atmosphere was somewhat dampened.</p>

<h3>Account of the Central Army's Recapture of Yongbao</h3>
<p>Zhang Guijun Retreats from Huangsha River to Quanzhou. Changsha correspondence: After Zhang Guijun's failed counterattack on Hengzhou on the 25th of last month, they retreated in disarray. The Eighth Route Army's three divisions led by Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, and Li Jingyang, the Fourth Route Army's two divisions led by Liu Jianxu and Luo Fanrong, and Li Yunheng's entire 53rd Division, a total of six divisions, pursued closely in the Qi, Chang, Lai, and Yong areas. On the 27th, they recaptured Leiyang. On July 1st, they recaptured Changning. On the 2nd, they recaptured Qiyang. On the evening of the 3rd, the Guizhou army abandoned Yongzhou and fled towards Quanzhou via the Huangsha River. Liu Jianxu's division recaptured Yongzhou on the morning of the 4th. According to Liu Yinggu, the Chief of Staff of the Fourth Route Army Headquarters, the military situation at the front is roughly as follows: The Eighth Route Army and Li Yunheng's division crossed Qiyang at 6 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, and the vanguard reached Huanggongling. The enemy's rearguard was at Daqiaopu, only ten miles away. The Fourth Route Army's two divisions led by Liu Jianxu and Wei Fanrong, and Chen Guangzhong's brigade, crossed Baishui and reached Dazhong Bridge at 6 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, all advancing towards Yongzhou. After the two major battles of Qitang and Huilong Temple, Zhang Guijun's elite forces were completely lost. They retreated to the Xiongpi Ridge area and stubbornly resisted by relying on the dangerous terrain, hoping to make a final struggle. Bai Chongxi, Zhang Fakui, and Yang Tenghui were all commanding on the front lines. The battle was fierce. Our officers and soldiers took turns in close combat and charged for half a day, breaking through the enemy, seizing over 1,000 rifles, many machine guns and mortars, and capturing 700-800 people. The casualties were countless. The following is a record of the Air Force's report: Report 1: Airmen Lu Zhenxian and Yuan Keming flew the Cesa 2 aircraft at around 6 AM on the morning of the 4th. Yang Yafeng and Liu Chao flew the Xiangjiang aircraft, surveying and bombing the Guizhou army in the Yongzhou-Huangsha River area. At around 8 AM, they flew over Yongzhou and saw our army flags on the city walls and corners of houses. People and horses were continuously advancing towards Yongzhou outside the city. The two aircraft circled Yongzhou several times and then reconnoitered the Yongzhou-Quanzhou road. They saw scattered enemy soldiers fleeing towards the Huangsha River in the Maolipu and Shuangpaipu areas. They dropped bombs separately, and the enemy suffered casualties along the way. Report 2: The Cesa 2 aircraft finished reconnoitering and bombing in Huangsha River in the morning and returned to Hengzhou to reload gasoline and bombs. Then, with the Shui Rongke aircraft, it flew to the front. Arriving at the Huangsha River, they saw many enemy shadows in the houses. They dropped six 120-pound bombs. The Cesa aircraft also descended to a height of 800 feet and strafed with machine guns, killing countless enemies. They then proceeded to the front of the Huangsha River and saw a stream separating Hunan and Guizhou. The city of Quanzhou was faintly visible. Because they were afraid of insufficient fuel, they did not go. They returned to their base at around 7 PM. The above is the situation of the recapture of Yongzhou. Liu Jianxu's troops entered Yongzhou on the 5th to prepare to pursue towards Quanzhou. As for Baoqing, it was already recaptured by Chen Wo's brigade of the 31st Division on June 22nd. Later, Chen's brigade was ordered to enter Qiyang to intercept Zhang Guijun, leaving Baoqing empty. Li Zemin, the commander of the Guizhou army's newly formed independent division, re-occupied Baoqing on June 25th. He Jian then dispatched Tong Kun, the deputy brigade commander of the 16th Division, to lead two regiments to suppress the bandits via Xinhua from Changde. On July 1st, they arrived at Wulipai, five miles outside Baoqing City, and set up cannons on the mountain to bombard Baoqing City. After two days of siege, Li Zemin, knowing that he could not resist, quietly fled towards Xinning on the evening of the 2nd. Tong's brigade entered the city on the afternoon of the 3rd and recaptured Baoqing for the second time. Based on this observation, the Guizhou army will completely withdraw from Hunan Province, and the military affairs in Hunan Province will come to an end. He Yingqin will return to Wuhan after the Central Army arrives in Quanzhou. (5th)</p>
<h3>Fan Shisheng Telegraphs that He Defeated Liu Ruming's Troops in Guanghua</h3>
<p>The counties of northern Hubei are as peaceful as ever. Hankou correspondence: Liu Ruming's troops of the Northwest Army, trapped in Xichuan, repeatedly invaded northern Hubei but were repelled by the Central Army. During the tense situation of the Pinghan Railway battle, Yang Hucheng's troops were ordered to take the left flank and advance to the area between Yexian and Lushan. As a result, the military strength in northern Hubei and southern Henan was slightly reduced. Liu thought there was an opportunity to take advantage of, so he personally led his troops and the newly formed troops of Li Jintian, Xue Chengde, Hu Renyan, etc., about 8,000 people, to invade Guanghua. The situation was very fierce. Fan Shisheng, the commander of the 51st Division, facing a powerful enemy, telegraphed to He Yingqin, the Director of the Wuhan Headquarters, for instructions. At the same time, he ordered Li Zhuzhong's troops of his division to bravely fight back and transferred Xu Dezuo's troops, the guerrilla commander of Yunxian, to assist. From June 29th to July 3rd, after five days and nights of bloody battles, Liu's troops were finally repelled. Many were killed or captured. Liu personally led two battalions and fled to Zhangdian. Northern Hubei was relieved. However, the 51st Division and Xu Dezuo's troops inevitably suffered casualties due to their valiant fighting. All circles in Laohekou have decided to hold a large-scale memorial service for the fallen soldiers on the 18th to express their condolences. As for the details of the battle, the Wuhan Headquarters has announced Fan's victory telegram yesterday (5th), which is recorded as follows: He Yingqin, the director of the Hankou Headquarters, and Qian Jun, the acting director, recently received a telegram from Li Zhuzhong, the brigade commander of He Kou, stating that Liu Ruming personally went to Xuchang and led five regiments of infantry, one battalion of artillery (four mountain and field guns each), one company of special forces, and more than 400 pistols, as well as the newly formed rebel troops of Li Jintian, Xue Chengde, Hu Renyan, etc., totaling more than 8,000 people, to attack He Kou. Since the beautiful day, Liu has led his troops to attack Guanghua City from Yuntai Mountain, while the rebel Li Jintian has led bandits to attack Mashen Mountain. The sound of gunfire has not stopped day and night. Our officers and soldiers bravely fought back and held out for five days and nights, engaging in more than ten close combats. By 9 PM on the afternoon of the Jiang Dynasty, the rebel enemy had suffered more than half their casualties and the entire front line wavered. The puppet army commander Li Jintian was seriously injured, and the regimental commander Xu Yunxing was killed in action. After our second attack, the enemy could not hold out and collapsed towards Li Guanqiao. In addition to ordering the Cao and Wang regiments to send large numbers to pursue, and investigating the number of prisoners and seizures for separate reporting, I respectfully submit this telegram. There are currently no traces of the enemy within northern Hubei, I report respectfully. Fan Shisheng bows slightly (July 7th).</p>
<h3>Anhui Provincial Government Sends Troops to Suppress the Huo Bandits</h3>
<p>Bengbu correspondence: In central Anhui in recent months, bandits and communists have been rampant. The bandits in Liu'an have not been completely suppressed, and Huoshan has recently fallen again. The county is located in western Anhui, between Liu'an and Yingshan. On April 12th, the county seat was once captured by bandits. By early May, it was recaptured by the newly formed 5th Brigade of the Central Army, led by Pan Shanzhai. Last month, because the defenses of Liu'an City were tight, the brigade stationed in Huoshan was ordered to return to Liu'an. Therefore, the bandits in the county took the opportunity to rise again and attack the county seat. Gan Dayong, the county magistrate, believing that the county's militia was weak and could not resist, telegraphed the province for help and retreated to Meihe in Shucheng to await reinforcements. On the 27th of last month, more than 2,000 bandits gathered and entered Huoshan. Thus, Huoshan fell for the second time. The bandits burned and killed at will after entering the city, and forty to fifty good citizens were brutally murdered by the bandits every day. It is said that the bandits call themselves a division, but in reality, they only have more than 200 rifles and several box cannons. They now seem to be eyeing Shu and Liu. After receiving the report, the Anhui Provincial Government has sent troops to cooperate with the county to quickly recover the area. If they can earnestly pursue and suppress the bandits, the bandits will not be able to withstand a single blow. (July 7th)</p>
<h3>News of Bandit Suppression in Hunan Province</h3>
<p>Pingjiang and Liuyang Captured by Bandits Changsha Correspondence: Because the majority of the Central Army was concentrated in the Hengyong area of southern Hunan, there were not many troops stationed in Chang, Yue, Ping, and Liu, etc. The communist bandits took the opportunity to stir up trouble and plunder extensively. For example, Nan County was captured by He Long's troops of more than 1,000 people on June 28th. County Magistrate Cai Zanxun fled to Yuanjiang. The bandits retreated on the 29th. In one day and night, they plundered two to three hundred thousand yuan worth of private property and kidnapped sixty to seventy merchants and civilians for ransom, including a Catholic priest named Mi Guoliang, who was also kidnapped to Angxiang Guan's residence and demanded a huge ransom. He Jian has dispatched Tao Guang, the commander of the 31st Division, to personally lead two regiments to rush to the Nan, Hua, and Angxiang areas to suppress the bandits, but there are still no results. The county seat of Pingjiang was also captured by the communist bandit Peng Dehuai three times on June 28th (Peng has rebelled in Pingjiang, and within a year, he has captured Pingjiang three times), burning and killing for three days and nights. The entire city was reduced to ashes. He Yingqin then transferred Zhang Da's regiment, the commander of the 3rd Regiment of the 3rd Training Division, which was stationed in Liuyang to suppress the bandits. The bandits retreated to Changshou on the morning of June 1st, and the county seat of Pingjiang was immediately recovered. However, County Magistrate Hou Houzong fled to Changsha and dared not return to the county. Tens of thousands of refugees from Pingjiang fled to Jinjing and Wukou near Changsha, and the situation is extremely pitiful. Unexpectedly, just as Pingjiang was recaptured, Liuyang was captured by the communist bandit Kong Hezong on the 3rd. When the Central Army recaptured Changsha, Kong's bandits took advantage of the situation and broke into Liuyang County on June 21st. Later, He Yingqin transferred Zhang Da's regiment of the Training Division to suppress the bandits, and Kong's bandits retreated outside the county seat and lurked in the countryside. Because Zhang's regiment was transferred to Pingjiang, Kong's bandits took the opportunity to occupy Liuyang again. Refugees flocked to the province to escape the chaos. Liu Yinggu, the Director of the 4th Route Army Headquarters stationed in the province, telegraphed He Jian to transfer Peng Weiren's brigade of the 16th Division to suppress the bandits. Peng's troops are still on the front lines of Hengqi and it will take time to arrive, so Liuyang County is still occupied by the bandits. In addition, the communist bandit Huang Gonglue led thousands of people to invade Liling. He Jian telegraphed Zhang Qixiong's brigade to rush to suppress them from Zhuzhou. Although Liling City has turned the corner from danger, the bandits are still lurking in the countryside and have not been eliminated. The counties near Changsha have been thrown into chaos by the communist bandits, and the flames of war are raging everywhere. (5th)</p>
<h3>External Affairs Secretary Chen Talks About Party Doctrine</h3>
<p>Yesterday (7th) at the External Affairs Ministry's Memorial Week, after Minister Wang's report, Secretary Chen Xihou gave a speech on the method of studying Party Doctrine. An excerpt of his speech is as follows: I am honored to have been appointed by the Minister, along with comrades Fan and Zhou, to be responsible for studying Party Doctrine. I have only worked in the Party for ten years, and I am weak and shallow, with no contribution. Colleagues in the Ministry have always studied Party Doctrine and achieved excellent results in the central Party's previous test. I hope to always maintain this glory. I have the following three thoughts on studying Party Doctrine: (1) Studying Party Doctrine requires not being afraid of difficulties. Revolutions in France, America, and Russia arose in response to changes in the times, the progress of society, and the needs of the environment. Our country's revolution is probably similar. The Three Principles of the People are the theory of the revolution, addressing the revolutionary environment, and responsible for completing the revolution. They are practical and methodical, not mysterious or arcane. Don't be afraid of difficulties, work hard to study. (2) Studying Party Doctrine requires knowing and acting immediately. The Premier invented the theory of knowing is difficult and acting is easy. Knowing necessarily leads to action, and not knowing can also lead to action. However, knowing without acting is not knowing. In the past year or two, comrades have gradually committed the fault of knowing without acting. The masses need to be organized, but they do not organize them, allowing the communists to make trouble. The doctrine needs to be propagated, but they do not propagate it, allowing the opposition to spread rumors. On the contrary, it is said that corrupt officials clearly know that they must be overthrown, but many comrades, once they become officials, are constantly found to be corrupt. I hope comrades break the selfish concept and act immediately to realize the Three Principles of the People. (3) Studying Party Doctrine requires reading the original text. Recently, there are many people who distort Party Doctrine, and there are many conflicting opinions. Some advocate idealism, some advocate materialism, each with their own prejudices. We should study reality and focus on the original text, taking the Premier's theory as the theory, and we will succeed. The Ministry's regulations for studying Party Doctrine have already been announced. There are two prerequisites for the method of study: (1) How to arouse comrades' interest in reading books. (2) How to test their results after reading. Now, when we are studying the Five-Power Constitution and the Industrial Plan, we plan to first designate the number of pages to study and issue questions to everyone, testing them once every two weeks.</p>

Chairman Jin Enqi presided over the meeting according to protocol. First, the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting, the progress of the association, and the financial status. Finally, he stated that he had little to offer since taking over the association's affairs and felt deeply ashamed. Then, the discussion of various proposals began. Based on the results of the two preparatory meetings on June 27th and 30th, the proposals from the three provinces were summarized into a total of 20 items. After a discussion lasting four hours, the chairman announced that all the resolutions had been passed unanimously. The meeting adjourned at 5 o'clock, and a commemorative photo was taken. At 6 o'clock, Jin Enqi hosted a banquet for all members at the YMCA cafeteria. The results of the discussion of each proposal are as follows: (1) Proposal to promote domestic goods: The association will create an investigation form and send it to the joint chambers of commerce of the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, as well as the two special districts of Harbin and Rehe. The form will be forwarded to investigate in detail the types of goods, the amount of imports, and the domestic goods that can replace them, and then submit the completed form to the association. This form will be issued by the association before July 15th, and the chambers of commerce in each province and district must submit it to the association before August 15th for verification. (2) Proposal to establish a domestic goods exhibition hall: The association will write to the joint chambers of commerce in various provinces and districts of Northeast China, requesting them to be responsible for establishing a large-scale exhibition hall in the location of each joint chamber of commerce, and to establish it by 1930.

(6) Proposal to promote foreign trade and purchase domestic products: Banks should be invited to invest, or the banks can prepare for it. (7) Proposal to prohibit speculation in gold coins and gold notes: A supervisory committee should be established. Anyone buying gold coins should first report the purpose to the local chamber of commerce. Only after the chamber of commerce has verified and approved it can the purchase be allowed. Otherwise, it will be considered a violation of monetary law. Each chamber of commerce should monitor it locally. As for how to punish offenders, opinions should be gathered from each place and then determined. (8) Proposal to request that banks provide sufficient assistance: The association will submit a request to the Northeast Political Affairs Committee and the governments of various provinces and districts, ordering the banks to provide sufficient assistance. (9) Proposal to issue depreciated gold banknotes: The original proposer will submit detailed information and suggestions to the association. Once the association's economic committee is established, it will immediately study the method and submit it to the Northeast authorities or the Financial Committee for approval. (10) Proposal to promote thrift: This proposal is merged into the proposal to reduce the use of foreign goods and promoted with slogans. (11) Proposal to prohibit the lending of gold notes: This proposal is temporarily reserved. It will be discussed again after the authorities instruct</p>

<p>the banks on how to provide sufficient assistance. (12) Proposal to restore the stock exchange: The original proposer should return to Harbin and send a copy of the previous order from the Jilin Provincial Government regarding this matter to the association for further review and handling. (13) Proposal to correct banks that violate their inherent business nature: The association will submit a request to the Northeast authorities, ordering the banks that, except for operating large-scale industries that do not hinder general industry and commerce, they must not compete with merchants for profits and should use the saved funds to assist the market. (14) Proposal to reduce freight rates on the Chinese Eastern Railway and South Manchuria Railway: The freight rates on the Chinese Eastern Railway should first be outlined by the two chambers of commerce in Harbin and sent to the association, which will then forward them to the Northeast Political Affairs Committee to be submitted to the committee, the governments of the three provinces, the special district governor, and the Eastern Railway director for review and reduction. If there are no good results, a formal request will be submitted to strive for thorough implementation. As for the freight rates on the South Manchuria Railway, the four chambers of commerce in Changchun, Binjiang, Yingkou, and Andong should first submit an outline of their opinions to the association, and then the association will send a letter to the Manchuria Railway Company requesting a review and reduction in accordance with previous cases. If there are no good results, the chambers of commerce of the three provinces will jointly initiate the construction of the Yanchang branch line and the Andong-Linjiang Railway, as well as long-distance buses, to facilitate commercial transport. (15) Proposal for the association to prepare a Northeast Industry and Commerce Ten-Day Publication: Unanimously approved. (16) Proposal to stop gold price transactions: The association will send letters to the chambers of commerce of the three provinces and the special district, forwarding them to the chambers of commerce to notify all merchants that all wholesale domestic goods should be traded in the most common local currency. At the same time, each chamber of commerce should draft restrictive measures and report them to the association for record before September 1st. (17) Proposal to organize an economic discussion group: The draft organization was approved. The chairman will invite economic consultants and editors.

(19) Proposal to mediate internal disputes: A suggestion is made to the Dong Province authorities to discuss the procedures for sending a joint telegram, or the Northeast authorities can issue a telegram at the request of the association, or the association can send a telegram directly. (20) Proposal to quickly open commercial ports and adhere to the Baoning silver standard: Reserved.</p>
<h3>Changxing Coal Mine Bureau Increases Production</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Construction Department received an order from the ministry to promote domestic coal and immediately followed the instructions to investigate the supply and demand situation and supervised the various mines in the territory to find ways to increase production to meet the needs, and sent a letter to the Changxing Coal Mine Bureau to follow up on this. It is now reported that the reply letter contains a detailed description of the expansion plan. It is reported that the Construction Department has copied the original letter and reported it to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines. The original letter is as follows: (1) Your department's public letter No. 110 was approved to urge the mines to find ways to increase production, please check and reply, etc. (2) The expansion of new wells and the increase in the production of existing wells in our bureau are described below: (1) Expansion plan: The old well in Simudun is currently 196 meters deep. After the Construction Committee took over, it first restored the remaining coal in the previous company's 96-meter, 146-meter, and 196-meter layers, and all of them were mined by opening stone alleys. If there are any that can be repaired, we will try our best to repair them. Since May of this year, we have started to dig a 50-meter blind shaft to extract coal from the 246-meter layer. It has now reached the bottom. After the stone gate is slightly arranged to expose the coal, and horizontal tunnels are needed, etc., the 246 horizontal tunnel is expected to produce coal by the end of September. On the side of Dameshan, because the well shaft is too damaged, it has been repaired repeatedly, so we are now starting to build green stone obstacles on the most damaged section to make it permanent. After the well shaft is repaired, coal will be produced in the 226 layer, which is expected to be reached next spring. On the Guangxing side, two new wells are being prepared. One well is almost to the coal, and it is expected to produce coal in early August. In terms of machinery, a new power plant has been started to concentrate the power and improve the efficiency of the underground machinery and electricity to increase the production. (2) Calculation of the annual output: January, the daily average is 200 tons; February, 230 tons; March, 320 tons; April, 313 tons; May to June, 400 tons; July to August, the daily average is about 450 tons; September to November, about 600 tons; December, about 650 tons. (3) According to the letter, it should be replied for your reference.</p>
<p>Local Communications</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Closure of Tianmashan Quarry: Jiang Erchang of Tianmashan raised funds to mine the Tianmashan stone mine, which aroused opposition from local people. Some said that it would destroy graves and expose bones, and others said that the scenic spots of Jiufeng should be preserved. The lawsuit has been going on for a long time. The Department of Agriculture and Mines sent personnel to investigate and found that the business was indeed inconsistent with the Mining Regulations and ordered it to stop. The county has forwarded the order to the Public Security Bureau for compliance. According to the bureau's reply, Jiang Erchang refused to comply with the order and came to the county. County Magistrate Jin ordered the arrest and transfer of the mine operator to the prefecture for interrogation because the mine operator refused to comply with the order to stop production, which was a blatant disregard for the law. He also issued six seals and led a police team to the mountain to close all three stone mines that were being mined. All existing mined minerals and the value of those already consumed are still subject to the previous order. The rest will be submitted to the Department of Agriculture and Mines for approval. It is reported that the Public Security Bureau has complied with the order.</p>
<p>Discussion on the Regulation of Fair Price Rice: The first district office of the county, in order to handle the fair price rice, which is approaching the opening period, summoned the township heads and the director of the distribution office on the 8th to review the register of poor households to make it more accurate. However, the population is large, and it cannot be completed in a short period of time. It was decided that the township heads would take it back for review and submit it to the office after three days. The investigation register of the township heads who did not arrive will be reviewed by the director of each distribution office, and the methods for opening the rice distribution at that time are stipulated as follows: (1) Poor households should distribute rice by the day with a certificate and payment. If they want to distribute rice together, it should not exceed five days. No supplementary distribution will be allowed after the due date. (2) The fair price rice will be reduced by one yuan per stone and forty wen per liter according to the Song market. (3) The cash inflow and outflow of each distribution office will be increased by thirty wen per yuan. The number of rice distributed and the cash received will be reported daily.</p>
<p>Communist bandit Gu Guilong and others escorted to Songjiang: Gu Guilong, the chief bandit of the Communist Party in Fengjing, was recently captured in Shengze and escorted back to Fengjing by the Fengjing Joint Defense Office. The various confessions have been admitted without denial. However, he firmly denied the Communist Party's uprising in Fengjing on the night of January 19, 1928, which involved burning, killing, and riots. After the victims testified about the Communist Party meetings and abductions, he could not deny them. The county government specially sent the police to escort Gu Guilong and two others back to the county for interrogation. They have now arrived at the county and are awaiting trial. The Third District Party Committee was sworn in: The Third District Party Department of Tinglin was organized. After the election of the executive and supervisory committee members, the district executive committee was officially established. The executive committee members Ye Changming, Zhou Xuelian, and Lu Youliang, the supervisory committee member Chen Qizhang, and more than 20 representatives from all walks of life attended the swearing-in ceremony the other day. Wang Tianren, the organizer of the county party department, presided over the swearing-in ceremony.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Gunfight Between Police and Bandits in Guoxiang Town: Guoxiang Town, located about seven or eight miles outside Fengmen, is connected to Yinshan Lake in the east and Jiushenggang in the west. Yesterday morning (the 8th) at 4 o'clock, suddenly 70 or 80 lake bandits, some speaking with Pudong accents and some speaking with Suzhou accents, arrived in the town on five boats. They robbed the firearms of the first squadron, third squad of the Qinglongqiao Water Police in the east of the town and the Baowei Regiment of the Wudaqiao in the west of the town. As a result, in addition to the robbery of machinery, two patrol boats of the water police were sunk, and one policeman was killed and one was wounded. The squad leader Gu Dingkui was seriously injured. The details are as follows: In front of the water police squad department, there were four patrol boats parked. The police officers either stayed overnight in the boats or in the squad department. The sentry Liu Desheng at the squad department gate caught a glimpse of the bandit boat approaching and raised his gun to ask questions. The bandits answered that they were fishing boats. Then they opened fire. Liu saw that the situation was not good and blew the whistle to warn. By the time the police officers woke up from their dreams and took their guns to meet the enemy on land and water, most of the bandits had landed and surrounded the squad department and the boats. As a result, only seven or eight of the more than twenty rifles remained, and more than ten were seized. Two patrol boats sank to the bottom of the lake after being hit by too many bandit bullets. Several guns sank at the same time. Zhu Dianyuan, the officer of boat No. 6, was shot in the left foot with a Mauser pistol. At the same time, another group of bandits who arrived in the town from Jiushenggang robbed seven or eight guns from the Baowei Regiment. Gu Dingkui, the squad leader of the water police's third squad, lived in the town about thirty stores away from the Qinglongqiao squad department. Gu Laohu, a water patrolman on boat No. 1, and Gao Xiaxiang, a helmsman on boat No. 4, lived in Gu's house. After hearing the police alert, Gu took his pistol and Gao Xiaxiang and others took their Mauser pistols and went out to fire at the bandits in an attempt to rescue the squad department. But the numbers were too disparate, and traffic was cut off. After a fierce battle, Gu Funian (Gu Laohu) was shot twice and died on the spot. Gao Xiaxiang was also slashed in the head, back, and arms with a large knife and fainted on the ground. Squad leader Gu was unable to support himself and was captured by the bandits and slashed in the paddy fields near the Qinglongqiao Qinglong Temple. Afterwards, passers-by caught a glimpse of him and rescued Gu, together with the wounded Gao Xiaxiang, and sent them to the Boxi Hospital in Tiancizhuang in the city. After examination by the Westerner Su Mai, Er diagnosed that Gu had two cuts to the head, each three inches long and eight minutes deep. His right foot was cut off at the ankle, with only the outer skin connected. Four fingers on his right hand were cut off, leaving only a little finger. His left hand was cut off at the wrist. His life was hopeless. Gu was 48 years old, from Chenmu, and had been in office for many years. He was very serious about suppressing bandits on weekdays. He had an 80-year-old mother, a wife, two sons, and four grandchildren at home. The people who heard about his tragic death at the hands of the bandits were extremely saddened. There are more than 100 stores and residents in the town, none of which were robbed. Only Principal Wang of Guoxiang Elementary School lost a leather suitcase worth about 40 yuan. The head of the Baowei Regiment is Yuan Shufeng, the head of the Yin-Guo District, who also serves as the head of the regiment. There are more than ten members of the regiment, and their strength is insufficient. The public security outpost has no firearms. The water police squad department originally had eight patrol boats under its jurisdiction, and the other four were stationed outside.</p>
<p>Verdict in the Car Driver Rape Case: Zhang Zhiming, a car driver from the Shanghai Special City Finance Bureau, was sentenced by the Shanghai Local Court to three years and six months of imprisonment for the crime of injuring public morals in the case of raping 17-year-old Zhou Xiufen. He appealed to the High Court in Suzhou. After repeated trials, the verdict was announced yesterday (the 8th) morning, finding that Zhou Xiufen's confession was insufficient and declaring him not guilty.</p>

Apart from Yuan Asan and Wu Xirong, who were captured in Shanghai and escorted back to Wuxi for interrogation and execution by firing squad, the remaining five criminals had not been captured despite the county government's offer of rewards for their arrest. At 7:00 PM the day before yesterday, a patrol team from the 14th branch of the Public Security Bureau in Zhangshe Township, Fuan Township, captured Zhang Aquan, one of the escaped prisoners. They immediately took him to the bureau for strict interrogation.

County Magistrate Sun personally opened the court for interrogation. Zhang Aquan confessed that since escaping from prison with the bandit Li Chengguo and six others in March of this year, he had continued to commit theft. He had done it once at the Cai family's house in Fuan Township. He said that Li Chengguo was hiding in a certain alley in the old city of Shanghai. Qian Longgen confessed that Zhang Aquan was Liu Aquan. He consulted with me and borrowed 500 wen from me. I knew nothing about the robberies at Yang Peigen's house, Qingshan Temple, and Shun Geng Farm. After the interrogation, he ordered Zhang Aquan to be shackled and imprisoned, and Qian Longgen to be detained pending judgment.</p>

They successively robbed six or seven villagers, including the An family, and fled with the stolen goods at dawn. The estimated loss is more than 2,000 yuan. The victims have not yet reported to the county to request an arrest. Also, at the residence of Shen in Shenjiaxiang, residents of the same township, six bandits came to the house last night, broke into the house, first tied up the family members, and then rummaged through boxes and cabinets, looting extensively. After half an hour, they fled with the stolen goods. After checking, it was found that white rice, clothing, and other items worth more than 1,000 yuan were stolen. Also, the afternoon before, a pig transport ship with 34 large pigs was suddenly attacked by four pirate ships in Jiaoshanzui, Nantaihu.

<p>Kidnapping Case in Tianningzhuang Town: At about 11:00 PM on the 7th, more than 10 bandits, all armed with handguns, came to Tianningzhuang Town, located at the border between Jiaxing North Township and Jiashan. They first made contact with the Baowei Regiment of the town, and then kidnapped Jiang Dege, a Nanhang merchant in the town, and Jiang's daughter, Xue Sishan, a rice merchant, and two shop assistants from a certain rice shop, totaling five people. The families of the kidnapped have reported to the authorities to investigate and rescue the victims. The Robbery of Cocoon Funds Was Found to Be Untrue: Near Nanguandang near Makeshui in Jiaxing North Township, on June 29, a certain Shanghai silk factory's Southern merchant, Yuan, bought Xia Lan from Linping and took the remaining funds of more than 30,000 yuan to Qizhen Temple to collect cocoons. When the boat was traveling through Guandang, it was suddenly attacked by a bandit ship, which robbed all the funds. Yuan rushed to report to the Qizhen Temple Public Security Branch to investigate, but there was no trace of the bandits. Now, it is learned that the authorities of the water and land police in Heyi were very concerned after the incident and sent officers to investigate the scene of the incident. The results of the investigation found that everything was untrue. A certain foreign firm in Shanghai had also insured the cocoon merchant for 20,000 taels against banditry, so it also sent many people to Heyi to investigate in detail, but there was no evidence. Later, Yuan's hired boat was found, and after detailed interrogation, the inside story was learned. Now it is known that Yuan has avoided this, and the insurance policy has been returned to a certain foreign firm for cancellation.</p>

<p>Robbery and Murder in Yandianqiao: In Yandianqiao, a place in the southwest township of this county, about three miles south of Xinhuang Town, the farmer Jin's family was suddenly attacked by seven or eight bandits on the morning of the second day. They broke into the house with short knives and clubs, tied up the owner, and forced him to hand over money and valuables. Because the family was poor, they were stabbed to death. His son and daughter-in-law were also stabbed six or seven times and fainted from bleeding. The bandits mostly spoke with local accents. Jin said, "You know a lot of people," and was stabbed to death. Yesterday afternoon, his wife sent his son and daughter-in-law to Pinghu by boat to report to the county government for an examination.</p>

Prostitute Stabbed in the Theater: Zhang Shendian at Dajiang Bridge in the city hired a troupe to perform on the 6th, which was very lively. On the evening of that day at 8:30 PM, a local prostitute from Jiumuqiao, named Hehua, dressed in a gorgeous outfit, came to watch the play. Because there were too many people, she could not squeeze into the auditorium, so she turned back to the Yueming Teahouse and took a sip of tea. After a short rest, she went downstairs and met a man who seemed to be familiar. After the two talked to each other, the man suddenly pulled out a sharp blade and stabbed the woman. Blood flowed like a torrent, and she fainted from the pain. After stabbing the woman, the man escaped despite the presence of soldiers and police. After the woman was stabbed, she was sent to Fukang Hospital for treatment by car. Because the injury was in the abdomen, her life was in danger.</p>

Unexpectedly, around 9 AM on the 5th of this month, more than ten bandits, armed with wooden-cased guns, rushed into Zhang Zhongfu's pharmacy, asking if the boss was in. The shop assistant replied that he was out. The bandits angrily said, "We've sent the notice for a long time, why haven't you paid?" They then destroyed all the equipment in the shop, and threatened to return with a large group to burn and loot if 400 yuan in foreign currency wasn't delivered to Xichi Pass in Bicun within three days.

<h3>Japan Recently Sets Four New World Records for Women</h3>
<p>(From Wei Village, Japan)</p>
<p>-100 Meters-Low Hurdles-Relay-Long Jump-</p>
<p>Hitomi Kinue's 100-meter time is 11.8 seconds.</p>
<p>Aiming to Retain Three World Women's Sports Championship Titles</p>
<p>The Third World Women's Sports Games are scheduled to be held in the capital of Czechoslovakia in September of this year. More than ten European and American countries will participate, with Japan being the only Asian participant. At the previous Athletics Championships, Japan won, shocking the world with the rapid progress of our Yellow race in sports. Japan, wanting to retain the championship this year, decided to send elite female athletes. The six selected athletes are Hitomi, Nakanishi, Watanabe, Muraoka, Honjo, and Hamasaki. They have been selected for over a month and are currently gathered at the Miyoshino Sports Field in Osaka for intensive training. All expenses are borne by the state, and they are given salaries as encouragement. The Osaka Mainichi Newspaper donates a monthly honorary salary of 500 yuan to Ms. Hitomi to support her family, allowing her to concentrate on sports. The athletes have only been training intensively for over a month, but their results have improved dramatically, exceeding expectations. Hitomi's 100-meter record at the last event was 12 seconds, which she still holds. Recently, the Japanese sports authorities tested her performance three times. The first time was 12 seconds, the second time was the same, and the third time she made an unprecedented 11.8 seconds. Hitomi's javelin throw has also improved by over three meters recently, now reaching 38 meters, approaching the world record. Her long jump has now reached 6.17 meters. In addition to Ms. Hitomi, Ms. Nakanishi's low hurdles time has also broken the world record, and Ms. Hamasaki's high jump of 1.50 meters also shows considerable promise. Honjo, Nakanishi, Watanabe, and Muraoka's 100-meter times are all below 13 seconds. Recently, they also held a 400-meter relay practice, with Ms. Honjo running the first leg, Ms. Watanabe running the second leg, Ms. Nakanishi running the third leg, and Ms. Hitomi running the fourth leg. The time was 48 seconds, also breaking the world record. If Japan wins the athletics championship at this year's World Women's Sports Games, the six female athletes will continue to train intensely for several more days before departing for Europe. Japan's prominent position in women's sports on the world stage truly brings honor to our Eastern race. Our country's female athletes should strive to catch up, and the government and education authorities should also emulate Japan by providing athletes with substantial support. The world records from the previous World Women's Sports Games and Japan's recent records are listed below:</p>

<h3>Fengtian Maru Sinks Norwegian Ship</h3>
<p>▲Loss of Over 400,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The sea off Chenshan Cape in Shandong Bay is the most difficult to navigate and accidents often occur. Last time, the China Merchants Bureau's Xin Kang ship was sunk by the Japanese ship Ryuno Maru in the same area. This time, the Kai Company chartered the Norwegian ship Depoto to transport coal, and it was sunk in the same area by the Dalian Steamship Company's Fengtian Maru. The loss of the ship and cargo is several hundred thousand yuan. The news heard yesterday is recorded below.</p>
<p>▲Collision Situation: The Dalian Steamship Company's Fengtian Maru, departing from Shanghai for Dalian, first went to Qingdao to load passengers and then to Dalian Bay. At 4:45 AM on the 7th, when the ship was sailing to Shandong Bay, there was a heavy fog at sea. The Fengtian Maru was a regular passenger ship and could not delay its journey, so it proceeded as usual. It met the Depoto, which was carrying 3,700 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai. When the ships were sailing to Shandong Bay, they were close to each other, obscured by the fog, and each did not see the other. When the two ships sailed into the same route and gradually approached, they became aware of each other. They each pulled back and tried to give way, but it was too late. In that instant, they were both panicked and intended to give way to the left and right, but with the horsepower at full speed, both ships took the opportunity to move straight ahead. With a loud crash, the bow of the Fengtian Maru struck the side of the Depoto. The water pressure was enormous, and the Norwegian ship was immediately pierced.</p>
<p>▲Sinking Situation: The outer iron plates of the Depoto were completely shattered by the collision. The Fengtian Maru was newly built last year, and the collision occurred with the bow, causing a large hole in the side of the Norwegian ship. After the Fengtian Maru reversed and moved back after the collision, the hole in the Depoto was broken below the waterline, and it was heavily loaded. Seawater rushed into the ship, and the ship began to sink into the sea. At that time, the hole in the Depoto was too large to be saved. The entire ship sank to the bottom of the sea within ten minutes.</p>
<p>▲Rescue Situation: The crew of the Depoto were unable to escape after the accident. Six crew members and thirty-five sailors (including six Westerners, twenty-five Chinese, and the shipowner named Johnson) were unable to launch the lifeboats. Therefore, all the crew members and sailors fell into the sea (this ship did not carry passengers). The sky was already slightly bright at the time. The Fengtian Maru also stopped and anchored at sea, launching small lifeboats into the sea to help rescue the sailors who had fallen into the sea. It was heard that all were rescued. The Fengtian Maru then took the crew and sailors to Dalian and then transferred them back to Shanghai. The bow of the Fengtian Maru was also damaged, but the passengers on board were unharmed.</p>
<p>▲Loss Situation: The Depoto is owned by a Norwegian shipping company, with a load capacity of 4,150 tons. Both the ship and cargo were lost, and the crew members' and sailors' clothing and luggage were not recovered. Therefore, the loss is at least over 400,000 yuan. Whether it can be salvaged is still unknown. The damaged bow of the Fengtian Maru also needs to be repaired. The sunken ship is located at 37 degrees north latitude and 123 degrees 03 east longitude, 170 nautical miles north of Qingdao. There were 300 passengers on board the Fengtian Maru, heading to Shanghai, Qingdao, and Dalian, and over a thousand pieces of cotton yarn and other goods loaded in Shanghai. Yesterday, passengers and cargo owners in this city who were involved inquired at the bureau. The company said that it had arrived safely in Dalian on the evening of the 7th.</p>
<h3>Chinese Telephone Subscribers Strive for Sovereignty</h3>
<p>The Chinese Subscribers Association of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company sent letters to various organizations yesterday, distributing declarations, requesting unanimous support. They also sent a letter to the International Telephone and Telegraph Company, issuing a warning, and sent letters to US Minister Johnson and the Consul, urging them to respect Chinese sovereignty. The letters and declarations are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Letter to the International Telephone and Telegraph Company: Dear Sir, We are writing to you regarding the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company. Since the special shareholders' meeting was held on June 27th, your company has successfully bid and, with the company's consent, obtained the exclusive right to operate the city's telephone business for forty years. It seems that everything is going according to your company's plans. However, we want to draw your company's attention to the fact that operating a public telephone business in the Chinese mainland is not as easy as your company imagines. Regardless of your company's position and the means you adopt, one thing must be noted: the Shanghai concession is merely a foreign settlement. In law, it is still Chinese territory. Therefore, the ultimate land sovereignty still belongs to the Chinese government. If your company wants to obtain a solid foundation for its business, it must obtain formal approval from the Chinese government. Otherwise, any franchise is not a permanent guarantee, because the concession system itself will soon be abolished. Those engaged in public utilities in the concession should also see this early. Furthermore, the scope of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company's telephone business is not entirely within the concession. It has extended its lines to various places, in the so-called "extra-territorial road construction" sections. For this part, the Chinese government can act freely. If your company has not obtained the legal procedures in advance, it will inevitably cause various disputes that will affect your company's business. We are all Chinese subscribers of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company. We do not oppose foreign investment in China, but if you want to maintain a permanent business relationship with the Chinese people, you must respect the sovereignty of our government. We cannot allow the loss of Chinese government sovereignty. We will not cooperate in business with any foreign company that does not respect sovereignty. Therefore, we hope that your company will carefully weigh the pros and cons to avoid disputes.</p>
<p>▲Letter to Various Organizations: Dear Sir, It has been determined that our country's telephone business is state-owned. However, this time, the International Telephone and Telegraph Company, without the approval of our government, purchased the assets of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company, disregarding our national sovereignty and failing to request an exclusive operating license from our government. Although our government has repeatedly protested and the public has opposed it, the company has turned a deaf ear. The members of our association are subscribers of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company, and we are filled with righteous indignation and dare not remain silent. Therefore, on June 27th, we established the Chinese Subscribers Association of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company. In addition to submitting a serious protest to the government and seeking to recover the business for self-management as soon as possible, we will take various effective measures and absolutely not cooperate with the International Telephone and Telegraph Company to uphold national sovereignty and maintain the interests of the Chinese people. We are sending this letter together with a declaration for your review and unanimous support. Not only will subscribers benefit greatly, but national sovereignty will also be relied upon. Attached is the [Declaration of the Chinese Subscribers Association of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company]. It has been determined that our country's telephone and telegraph business is state-owned, as stipulated in Article 2 of the Telecommunications Regulations promulgated by the government on April 18, 1915. Those who privately establish telephones in a certain area must also obtain a license from the government, as specified in Article 3 of the same regulations. Since our National Government established its capital in Nanjing, there has been no change in the state-owned operation of telegraphs and telephones, and it has been clearly stipulated that private telephone installations must be approved by the government. This is because the telephone in the area is related to the national transportation, and it should naturally be approved by the government. This is not a creation of our country, but a common practice in the legal systems of various countries. The Shanghai concession is a part of our country's territory, so it is not allowed for any private individual to operate a telephone business in this area without the approval of our government. Now, regardless of whether the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company's treatment of our subscribers has been satisfactory or whether it has caused any obstacles to our national transportation, the special shareholders' meeting dared to disregard our government's protest and ignore the opposition of our people. The Chinese shareholders did not attend the meeting, and the decision to sell to the International Telephone and Telegraph Company was made arbitrarily and outrageously, which is abhorrent. The International Telephone and Telegraph Company also dared to purchase without waiting for the approval of our government. It is also very obvious that they dared to infringe on our sovereignty and violate our laws and regulations. All of our citizens, in order to uphold national sovereignty and maintain the authority of the law, can no longer tolerate this. Now, all of our subscribers have unanimously decided that, in addition to submitting a serious protest to the government and declaring that it should immediately stop its illegal operations before it obtains the exclusive operating rights for the telephone, we, the subscribers, are prepared to take various effective measures against its illegally privately installed telephones and absolutely not cooperate before the legal procedures are completed. We will do what we say, and we will not hesitate to do what is right. This declaration is hereby made for your public knowledge.</p>
<p>▲Letter to US Minister and Consul: The Chinese Subscribers Association of the Telephone Company sent a letter to the US Minister and Consul yesterday regarding the sale of the telephone in the Public Concession, saying: Dear Sir, The bid for the sale of the Shanghai Concession Telephone Company has been won by the International Telecommunications Company, which is organized under US law. This matter is understood to be within your knowledge. Regardless of the company's position and the means it adopts (the following is the same as the letter to the International Telecommunications Company), we are writing to you specifically to ask you to inform the people of your country and urge them to consider the fundamentals and the feelings and welfare of all parties involved when running their businesses.</p>

The Chinese Ministry of Industry and Commerce originally intended to order major domestic cement companies to carefully select personnel to attend, but due to the fact that the cement companies did not have suitable talent who could attend and the date of the meeting was approaching, it happened that Ling Hongxun, the director of the Longhai Railway Engineering Bureau, was dispatched to Belgium to represent China at the International Research Conference on Industrial Vocational Education. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce ordered him to participate in the International Cement Discussion Meeting nearby.</p>
<h3>⊙Changshu Rice Merchants' Association Collects Special Donations</h3>
<p>▲The Social Bureau Thoroughly Investigates: Previously, the Changshu rice merchants damaged the city's price limit for their own benefit. The Changshu Rice Merchants' Association in Shanghai was reported to have instigated and coerced the crowd. The Public Security Bureau has arrested and investigated the matter and obtained reports that the association collected special fees from rice boat owners, five or ten yuan per boat, for activities. Even rice boats that had not yet arrived in Shanghai were assigned this fee. The association's staff member Jin invited guests and swaggered around. The information was immediately transmitted to Jin, who was sent to the Public Security Bureau for custody and interrogation. According to the confession, the collection of special fees was decided by the association's report and meeting as a temporary expense and there was an official receipt issued and he was not involved. The Social Bureau believes that the purpose of the special donation collected by the association and the reason for the decision to collect it, according to the regulations for supervising people's organizations, must be reported to the Social Bureau for approval in advance. Now that the association has not complied with this, it has been ordered to make a clear statement so that a thorough investigation can be conducted.</p>
<h3>⊙Do Not Obstruct Rice Boats Transporting to Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲The Social Bureau Sends a Letter to the Wuxian County Government: After seeing the news that the Wuxian County Government had convened a meeting of rice industry representatives to ban the transportation of rice, the Shanghai Social Bureau was unable to determine whether the news was true. It immediately sent a letter to the Wuxian County Government, asking it not to obstruct rice boats transporting to Shanghai. The original letter said: According to a report on the 5th of this month, your county magistrate convened a meeting of rice industry representatives and the chairman of the chamber of commerce at 8 AM on the morning of the 4th to suppress rice prices. The first item of the resolution was to temporarily prohibit transportation from July 7th to the end of September. In addition to the county government's announcement, the Public Security Bureau was ordered to strictly investigate and prohibit it. If found, the rice will be confiscated. It is impossible to determine whether the above is true or not. However, we believe that all places are suffering from food shortages, and prohibition and restriction are of great concern. It is necessary to regulate each other to help the people's food. If the source of rice in the rice-producing areas is transported out, then if our city is a general distribution center for foreign rice, it will prohibit the internal transportation of foreign rice to maintain the local people's food. The panic that will be felt by the people in the mainland will be greater than that in Shanghai. The bureau is aware that the Wuxian Water Patrol Team has repeatedly detained rice boats transporting to Shanghai. It is deeply concerned that the report is not false and that the same incident will occur again. Therefore, we request your government to investigate and issue a notice to its subordinates to comply with the central government's order prohibiting 𨤠糴, and not to obstruct ships carrying rice to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>⊙All Sea Vessels Have Been Approved to Resume Service</h3>
<p>▲Announced by Fang Hao Yesterday: Yesterday, the various shipping companies in this city received a notice from Fang Hao, a member of the Transportation Department. The sea vessels that were ordered to temporarily suspend service, now, in order to consider the difficulties of merchants and maintain the shipping route, except for the eight ships that have already left, the other thirteen ships, which were originally scheduled to go to Changyue yesterday, are generally suspended and are allowed to resume commercial service. Yesterday, the shipping companies have notified the ships that, except for today, the anniversary of the Northern Expedition, when the customs is closed, they will resume service as usual from tomorrow.</p>
<h3>⊙Foreign Minister Wang Comes to Shanghai to Host a Banquet</h3>
<p>▲At the Foreign Affairs Discussion Meeting on the Evening of the 11th: Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting is scheduled to come to Shanghai on the morning of the 11th for a short rest. He is also scheduled to host a banquet at the Foreign Affairs Discussion Meeting on Avenue Joffre at 7 PM that evening, inviting Minister of Industry and Commerce Kong Xiangxi, Qian Xinzhi, and US Consul Cunningham. The invitation was issued by the Foreign Affairs Office yesterday.</p>
<h3>City Center Area - Road System Announced</h3>
<p>The road system for the city's central area, previously approved by the 158th municipal meeting, was officially announced yesterday (July 7th), coinciding with the third anniversary of the Shanghai Municipal Government's establishment. Detailed plans will be published in a separate book. Here is a simplified explanation we've obtained: The city center is the hub of the entire city, so its road system should be prioritized to facilitate development. This plan focuses on the city center and its surrounding areas, considering the current situation and predicting future trends for planning purposes. The following is an explanation: ㈠ Arterial Road System: The layout of arterial roads (over 30 meters in width) in the city center is explained below: (甲) Arterial Roads Connecting to Docks: Currently, the city's important docks are mainly located in the leased territories south of the city center and along the Huangpu River in the Nanshi area. However, with the increasing tonnage of ocean vessels in recent years, the status and facilities of these docks are becoming insufficient. The construction of a large-scale commercial port is necessary to meet the demand. The deeper waters near Wusong are indeed suitable for building a new commercial port. To connect with this new commercial port, in addition to the arterial road along the Huangpu River, there are also three arterial roads west of the city center that can reach the port. In the future, as this area develops, the inland waterway transportation of Yunzaobang will also flourish. These arterial roads can also serve to connect inland river docks. (乙) Arterial Roads Connecting to Railways: Currently, the terminal stations of the existing Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways are located in the Zhabei district, too far from the city center and the leased territories. The railway tracks intersect the city at the same level as roads, obstructing road traffic. Furthermore, there is no connection with waterways or docks, preventing improvements in transportation efficiency. The scale</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>is small and insufficient to meet future transportation needs. For the sake of the city center and the overall development of the city, the existing railways and stations must be relocated. According to modern practice in major cities worldwide, railway stations are separated for freight and passenger transport. Freight stations should be large in scale and located in sparsely populated areas, while passenger stations should be as close to the city center as possible. Based on this concept, a main passenger station is assumed to be built next to North Zhongshan Road, allowing passengers and light cargo to be directly brought into the city center. To accommodate this plan, an arterial road with a width of 60 meters is proposed to be built from the Huangpu River bank on the east side of the city center, directly to the proposed passenger terminal. (丙) Arterial Roads Connecting Various Urban Districts: Currently, the most prosperous urban areas in the city are the leased territories and the Nanshi area. The old stations and docks are also mostly located there. Building arterial roads from the city center to connect these areas will, in the near future, directly absorb commercial and traffic activity within the city and indirectly attract passengers and goods from other locations. Therefore, it is crucial for promoting the development of the city center. In this plan, there are seven arterial roads connecting the city center with leased territories and Nanshi: ㈠ The Huangpu River arterial road starts from Wusong, passes along the Huangpu River on the east side of the city center, and connects to Yangshupu Road in the leased territories to reach the Bund. ㈡ The road, improved and widened from the old Jungong Road, also connects to Yangshupu Road. ㈢ The arterial road immediately east of the municipal government building utilizes a section of the old Mayushan Road and connects to the leased territories. ㈣ The arterial road south of the municipal government building starts from Xiangyin Road, utilizes a section of Songhu Road, and connects to the leased territories. ㈤ The arterial road west of the municipal government building, coming from Wusong, utilizes a section of the old Songhu Road and connects to Ningguo Road in the leased territories. ㈥ The parallel arterial road east of North Zhongshan Road reaches Wusong and Baoshan in the north, follows a section of the Eastern Sports Association Road route in the south, and connects to North Sichuan Road, which is being extended by the leased territories. This road is built to share the traffic load of North Zhongshan Road because that road will have especially heavy traffic due to its proximity to the future station and commercial port. ㈦ North Zhongshan Road reaches Wusong and Baoshan in the north, follows a section of the Western Sports Association Road in the south, passes through the Zhabei district, and connects with South Zhongshan Road to reach Longhua in the south. Arterial roads connecting the city center with other areas are also practically indispensable. Currently, three are planned: ㈧ The east-west arterial road north of the municipal government starts from North Zhongshan Road in the west and extends to the Huangpu River in the east. If a bridge or tunnel is built across the Huangpu River in the future, it can connect to Pudong. If extended westward, it can reach Hujiazhuang and Yanghang, etc. ㈨ The arterial road between the future passenger terminal and the Huangpu River is 60 meters wide. If a bridge or tunnel is built across the Huangpu River in the future, the east end of this road would be the most ideal location. ㈩ The arterial road from the Huangpu River utilizes the old Xiangyin Road and Shuidian Road to reach Dachang. As for the arterial roads ㈠, ㈤, ㈥, and ㈦, which connect to the Wusong and Baoshan areas, they have already been mentioned above and will not be repeated. (丁) Arterial Roads Connecting Various Parts Within and Around the Area: The above-mentioned arterial roads start from the city center and its surrounding areas and take the shortest distance to various destinations. Therefore, the system is roughly star-shaped. To facilitate traffic between arterial roads, there are also several ring-shaped or straight arterial roads that intersect with the roads leading to distant places. These are all marked in red on the map and will not be listed. ㈡ Secondary Road System: The establishment of secondary roads is solely for facilitating local traffic within the area and providing sufficient air and light to various buildings. Therefore, the width can be smaller (all below 38 feet). For this road system, the plan uses a grid pattern or a spider-web pattern, depending on whether the surrounding arterial roads are orthogonal or oblique. The goal is to divide the area into sections suitable for construction. Furthermore, since the city is located in the southern part of the temperate zone and receives strong sunlight, east-west facing houses receive particularly strong sunlight, which is not suitable for summer. Therefore, this plan generally lengthens the east-west sections to reduce the number of north-south roads. In addition, sections parallel to arterial roads are also lengthened as much as possible to reduce the intersection of secondary roads with arterial roads, thereby facilitating vehicle traffic on arterial roads. The detailed layout is shown in the map and will not be described further. ㈢ Open Spaces and Parks: For the health and mental well-being of citizens, all cities should have sufficient open spaces and parks for recreation, walking, and air regulation. Their layout is related to the road system and is therefore planned simultaneously within the scope of the proposed secondary roads. Currently, the area of parks in the city is severely lacking and is far from proportional to the area of the city. This plan makes an effort to correct this deficiency by establishing large open spaces and parks near the city center and striving for appropriate interconnections to beautify the city and facilitate sightseeing. In addition to reserving the existing Sijing Bridge Golf Course, Jiangwan Racecourse, and Far East Sports Field as open spaces, the following open spaces and parks will also be established: (甲) Parks and plazas around and in front of the municipal government building, to beautify the municipal government building. (乙) Parks and grasslands along the Huangpu River and both sides of the Yuanzhang River, Qiujiang Creek, and Xiaojipu Creek, to harmonize the scenery of parks and flowing water and to preserve the old streams and prevent them from being filled in. These parks will extend for a long distance, roughly forming a ring, to avoid the disadvantage of being seen at a glance and to create a sense of endless wonder. At the point where the Qiujiang Creek enters the Huangpu River, a seaplane airport is planned. (丙) In addition, parks will be established in appropriate locations to avoid imbalance.

<h3>Reflections and Efforts Needed for the July 9th Anniversary</h3>
<p>▲ Table of Contents: ㈠ Introduction ㈡ The Origin and Mission of the National Revolutionary Army ㈢ Review of the Northern Expedition's Achievements ㈣ Reflections and Efforts Needed for the July 9th Anniversary ㈤ Slogans. ㈠ Introduction: Since the European War, the liberation movements of oppressed peoples around the world have surged like a tide. Among them, the social revolution in Soviet Russia, the political revolution in Turkey, and the national revolution in China have been grand and turbulent, threatening to flood the earth and overwhelm the globe. The most shocking and terrifying thing for imperialism is our country's national revolutionary movement. Therefore, the ancient country in the Far East, with a quarter of the world's population, has once again risen up to fight against the imperialists. How can it not shock and frighten them? Our country's revolutionary movement originated in the late Qing Dynasty, grew in the early Republic, and flourished today. Looking back to four years ago, although China's revolutionary movement relied on the leadership and maintenance of our party for development, the campaigns of [Punishing Yuan] and [Protecting the Constitution] all rose and fell quickly, unable to complete unification and liberate the country from the oppression of warlords and the shackles of imperialism. Only after the Northern Expedition was launched on July 9th could we destroy the bastion of imperialism, restore the fragmented and incomplete country, see the light of day together, and regain our freedom. These great achievements are all the result of the national revolutionary movement. The advancement of the national revolutionary movement is due to the combination of the party and the people's armed forces, the National Revolutionary Army, being brave and determined, and devoting themselves to the battlefield. Therefore, the National Revolutionary Army is the vanguard of China's national liberation movement and the savior of the oppressed peoples of the world. We should commemorate this National Revolutionary Army, which has a glorious history and bears a great mission, with enthusiasm on the fourth anniversary of its Northern Expedition.</p>
<p>㈡ The Origin and Mission of the National Revolutionary Army: The reorganization of our party in the thirteenth year of the Republic was the beginning of a new life for our party and a turning point for the revival of the Chinese nation. During this period, there are two noteworthy points: one is the strict organization of the party, and the other is the creation of the party's army. The party and the army are the driving force of the national revolution and the cleanser of corrupt forces. The Premier of our party, considering the urgency of the Chinese nation's need for salvation and the unreliability of brave soldiers and generals, thought of organizing a party army as the basic military force for the revolution. Therefore, the Whampoa Military Academy was founded to train revolutionary military talents, hoping to forge them into a strong revolutionary force through the forging of doctrine. At that time, the officially established National Revolutionary Army had seven armies, each with party representatives and political departments to guide and supervise them. From the army commander down to the soldiers, they were all influenced and enlightened by doctrine every day, so they could unify their will, act decisively, and fight for the cause, opening a new era in the history of our country's revolution. At that time, the party's proposal for the Northern Expedition had been decided, so the Central Committee appointed Comrade Chiang Kai-shek as the Commander-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army on July 5th of the fifteenth year of the Republic, allowing him to command the army and direct the Northern Expedition. Commander-in-Chief Chiang then took office on July 9th at the Eastern School Field in Guangzhou, and Comrade Wu Zhihui represented the Central Committee to present the flag and give a speech. From then on, there was someone in command, and the plans were under control. So the army moved north and went straight to Huanglong. This tragic and great revolutionary movement was thus launched. Since the Opium War, the Chinese nation's cowardice and decadence have been exposed to the world. Therefore, the imperialists, relying on their gunboat policy, have been insulting and declining until today, with no limit to be recorded. We have long since changed from an independent country to a semi-colonial status. The reason for the formation of this phenomenon is due to the oppression of imperialism from the outside and the tyranny of warlords from the inside. The two colluded with each other, made use of each other, and worked together to do evil, making the disaster even more severe. It gradually formed a situation that was divided and disintegrated and could not be recovered. Our party takes saving the people, saving the country, and saving the world as its mission. It should eliminate and purge the warlords who harm the country and the people and the cruel and evil imperialists, place the country in independence, put the people in peace, and bring the world into great harmony. Since our party has taken on this major responsibility, it must have great military force to charge forward, kill the enemy and achieve results, in order to complete this arduous mission. In this Chinese national liberation movement, the first mission of the National Revolution is to defeat the warlords and the imperialists who collude with the warlords, in order to achieve freedom for China.</p>
<p>Equality. The second step is to implement reorganization and exert efforts in construction and production to consolidate the foundation of the country and enhance its status. The third step is to wipe out all imperialism and save all the weak and small nations of the world. The National Revolutionary Army is the one who is fighting with this mission. Since the Northern Expedition, four years have passed, and the achievements of the National Revolutionary Army are bright and shining, with great achievements and merits. It should be immortalized in history and sung by people. But looking ahead, the great cause of the revolution has not yet been completed. I feel that the National Revolutionary Army's responsibility in the future is even more important and the road is long. Therefore, in addition to commemorating it, I would like to express my infinite hope. ㈢ Review of the Northern Expedition: The National Revolutionary Army marched from Hunan, and wherever it went, it was invincible. In a few weeks, it conquered Hengyang and Changsha-Yueyang, moved north, settled Wuhan, waved its spears eastward, possessed Jiangxi and Anhui, and then descended on Zhejiang and Fujian, conquered Songhu and established the capital in Nanjing. In a short period of time, two-thirds of the national territory had been placed under the blue sky and white sun. At that time, the Northern Expeditionary forces did not exceed 60,000, and the stubborn enemy in front of them was ten times the number, but they were able to eliminate the two major warlords, Wu and Sun, and destroy the bastion of the imperialists in the southeast in the shortest period of time. Later, the Communist bandits conspired to subvert the party and the country. The Central Committee devoted itself to purging the communists to consolidate the foundation of the party, so the Northern Expedition was temporarily suspended. In the spring of the seventh year of the Republic, the second phase of the Northern Expedition actively advanced again. Wherever the righteous army went, they responded to the wind. Although the Japanese imperialists sent troops to obstruct it, the reactionary forces on their way to the sunset had already collapsed and lost their ability to resist. So they conquered Bian and Luo, conquered Pingjin, and the situation of unification was achieved. According to this Northern Expedition, from the time the army was sent out to the time of unification, it took no more than three battles. The speed of success is rare in the world. During this short period, the revolutionary movement has made such amazing progress and success. This is due to the loyalty, bravery, and courageous fighting of the revolutionary generals and soldiers, and their ability to win the sympathy and support of the people of the whole country, so that the military force and the people are united. This is an important reason. From this, it can be seen that the great doctrine of our party and the importance of the political program are the only treasures for saving the country, saving the people, and saving the world, without any doubt.</p>
<p>㈣ Reflections and Efforts Needed for the July 9th Anniversary: The commemoration of the Northern Expedition launched on July 9th coincides with the fourth anniversary today. How should we express our commemoration and carry forward its spirit? There are so many feelings, and it is difficult to express them in a few words. Here are a few points to consider for the people of the country. The tragedy and greatness of the launching of the Northern Expedition on July 9th in the history of our country's revolution has been described above. Our commemoration of July 9th is not in the form of slogans, but in commemorating the great spirit of the revolutionary martyrs' long march, not being afraid of difficulties, not being afraid of death, sacrificing for the people, and fighting for the cause. It is not in the shouts and slogans of a temporary excitement, but in adhering to the lofty personality of the revolutionary martyrs who were arduous and determined, forgetting the family for the country, and forgetting the self for the public. We should inherit this spirit and personality, so that the relics of the martyrs can be further developed and glorified, so as to fulfill the responsibility of those who died later. This is one point. From the beginning of the Northern Expedition to the completion of the unification, more than 50,000 armed comrades died in battle, and more than 70,000 were wounded. The sacrifice was great and unparalleled. The unification brought about by the great sacrifice, how should we cherish it, support the central government, work hard in political training and construction, and promote the realization of doctrine and political program? The remaining warlords in the country have also revived and endangered the party and the country, hoping to repeat their old dreams of separatism. Our commemoration of July 9th should continue the revolutionary spirit of the martyrs, inspire us to eliminate the rebels and consolidate the party and the country, in order to save the people from the fire and water. This is the second point. Destruction is a necessary process for revolution, and construction is a long-term plan for governing the country. In the process of the national revolution, the sacrifices and sufferings suffered by the people of the whole country are unspeakable, but the only hope lies in the improvement of the environment and the improvement of the status after the revolution. Now that the period of destruction has passed, we should strive for peace and construction to appease the homeland and comfort the people. Therefore, our commemoration of July 9th should be to shake off our spirits, devote ourselves to the local peace and eradication of bandits, abolish all exorbitant taxes, and engage in national construction, so that the people of the whole country can enjoy happiness and benefit as soon as possible, so that the sacrifices of the past revolution will be meaningful. This is the third point. The political program revealed by our party is to abolish all unequal treaties in order to restore the independence and freedom of the country. However, this kind of undertaking cannot be achieved in a moment, and it must be achieved through considerable efforts over a period of time. In the climax of the national revolution, we have done some work for the country and restored some of the lost rights, but looking ahead, there are still many sovereign rights waiting to be restored. Therefore, our commemoration of July 9th should be to strive to abolish unequal treaties and restore the rights that the country should have, in order to fulfill the unfulfilled aspirations of the martyrs. This is the fourth point. Overthrowing imperialism and eliminating warlords and corrupt officials are important objectives of the national revolution. Now the imperialists are still watching us around us, and they are conspiring to harm us. Corrupt officials and villains are still rampant and lawless. Our commemoration of July 9th should continue the spirit of the martyrs to kill the enemy and achieve results, eliminate evil, and launch a general attack on imperialism and corrupt officials and villains, and eliminate them all. This is the fifth point. In summary, these five points are the reflections and efforts that we should have in commemorating July 9th. If the people of the whole country can have this kind of understanding and effort, then the freedom and equality of the Republic of China will not be difficult, and the world's nations can also be united soon. ㈤ Slogans: Launching the Northern Expedition is to fulfill the Premier's will. Launching the Northern Expedition is the initial work of the National Revolution. The success of the Northern Expedition is the precursor to the realization of the Three People's Principles. Commemorating the Northern Expedition requires abiding by the Premier's instructions. Commemorating the Northern Expedition requires thoroughly eradicating the remaining reactionary warlords. Commemorating the Northern Expedition requires striving for political training and construction. Down with imperialism, abolish all unequal treaties. Long live the success of the National Revolution, long live the Chinese Kuomintang, long live the Republic of China.

<h3>Tian Tong's Coffin Moved Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ More than 500 people attended the funeral. Mr. Tian Ziqin, a pioneer of the revolution, died of illness in Shanghai on the 2nd of this month. In recent days, important figures from all sides have been visiting his home to pay their respects in an endless stream. Yesterday, the coffin was moved to the Hubei Guild Hall for temporary placement. About 500 people from all sides attended the funeral, and there were crowds of onlookers along the way. When the hearse passed, the road was blocked. Chairman Chiang heard the news at the front and was extremely sad. He sent a special telegram to Xiong Shihui, commander of the Songhu Garrison, to go to pay his respects and donated 1,000 yuan. The National Government ordered Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun to assist in the funeral and ordered the military and police to protect the route along the way. Mayor Zhang left Shanghai on business and specially sent Qi Tiechen, director of the First Section, to assist in everything. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters sent a military band. The Shanghai Municipal Government ordered the Public Security Bureau to send a platoon of police officers to salute with guns when the hearse passed. Other important figures attending the funeral included Xiong Kewu, Jiao Yitang, Wang Yongbin, Lu Shidi, Chu Fucheng, Liu Kuiyi, Li Jihong, Zhao Tieqiao, Xie Yuanhan, Pang Qingcheng, and Shanghai County Magistrate Yan Shenyu, etc. There were thousands of telegrams. The various ministries and committees of the National Government, the various provincial governments, the various levels of party headquarters, and the various important figures all sent condolences. In addition to being published in various newspapers one after another, dozens of condolence telegrams were received yesterday from He Chengyu, He Yingqin, Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, Fang Benren, Zhou Zhenlin, Shi Qingyang, Ye Chucang, Zou Lu, Huang Changgu, and Xie Chi, etc. It can be said that it was a grand event.</p>
<h3>County Adjustment Committee's Request</h3>
<p>Improvement of Third-Class Passenger Cars on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway ▲ Detailed Description of Insults to Passengers by Railway Bureau Staff and Others ▲ The Shanghai County Party Affairs Adjustment Committee submitted a document to the Provincial Adjustment Committee yesterday, stating: "We are submitting a request to be forwarded to the Central Government, ordering the Ministry of Railways to quickly improve the third-class passenger cars on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway to benefit travelers. The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway is located in the center of the country, and in the past, travelers have been prosperous. Since our party established its capital in Nanjing, due to the relationship of the political center, traffic has become more frequent and development has been seen. The existing shortcomings should be improved. However, it has been a long time and things are still the same, especially the third-class passenger cars. Now, we will present them in separate articles: ㈠ There is no limit to the number of people, so that every car is full. Those who arrive later have no place to stand, let alone a seat. ㈡ The equipment is not hygienic, such as small windows and uncleaned toilets. Because there is no limit to the number of passengers, carbon gas fills the air and hinders breathing. ㈢ Soldiers occupy seats, and the railway bureau does not interfere. Soldiers are often seen stretching out their feet and sleeping in the third-class seats, and other passengers have no place to sit. ㈣ The distance between the seats in the car is narrow, and there are many vendors who carry baskets and sell things in the crowd, hindering passengers. Most of the food sold is rotten and of poor quality, and there is no crackdown. ㈤ The rudeness of the staff is especially evident in the third-class cars. They hold class prejudices, thinking that it is okay to insult the passengers here. Inspectors and servants often arbitrarily insult passengers, especially the rural people in the interior. If they argue with them, they will not only not understand, but also beat and insult them. The above are just a few examples, and it can be seen that improvements are urgently needed. It has been resolved at the 27th meeting of the association to submit a request to your association to forward it to the Central Government, ordering the Ministry of Railways to quickly improve it. We should prepare a document for review and earnestly forward it for the convenience of the party."</p>

<p>▲ Family Moved to Shanghai This Spring. Li's entire family moved to Shanghai this spring. They initially lived on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. Later, because Li's wife, Liu, had a cousin named Wang, who is now a judge in the Civil Court of the local court and also lives in the Chinese area, they moved to No. 1 Jingde Lane, Huangjia Que Road, near the Old West Gate in the South City a month ago for convenience.</p>
<p>▲ Seven Kidnappers. Around 8:40 PM the night before last, just as the family was about to have dinner, seven male kidnappers wearing blue cloth jackets and trousers suddenly rushed in through the back door, along with one female bandit with a bobbed haircut. Three bandits were guarding the back door, while five bandits went straight into the living room, leaving two bandits in the living room to guard with guns, and three bandits broke into the west wing room and went straight to Li's bedroom.</p>
<p>▲ Silencing the Victims. After the three bandits entered the room, one of them immediately showed a pistol, warning Liu not to make a sound. At the same time, all the windows were tightly closed. At that time, Liu's elder sister was holding Li's son, Desheng, who was urinating. When she saw the three bandits break in, she quickly hugged Desheng and ran towards the back. Unexpectedly, one of the bandits was quick and agile, chasing forward and intercepting Liu's sister.</p>
<p>▲ Snatching the Child. After one of the bandits intercepted Liu's sister, he snatched Desheng and fled. Liu's sister was also beaten to the ground by the bandits. At that time, a woman surnamed Mou, who lived with them, stepped forward to snatch the child, but was also slapped several times by the bandits. As a result, the bandits kidnapped Desheng and fled, escaping through the door. Although everyone chased after them, it was too late. Liu immediately rushed to her cousin Judge Wang's house to report everything.</p>
<p>▲ Reporting and Hoping for Arrests. Li's residence is about 70 steps away from the police station of the Second District General Office. The kidnapping took just over a minute, but no one called for help at the time. It was not until after 10 o'clock that she made a report to the Second District General Office. After hearing the news, District Chief Wang immediately sent patrol chief Gao Hongbin and Gao Ziqiang, along with several armed policemen, to rush to the scene, but the bandits were nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>▲ Post-Event Speculation. Seeing that the bandits had already fled far away, Officer Gao immediately returned to the station to report and submit a report to the General Bureau. At the same time, he ordered his subordinates to conduct a strict search. According to Liu, they usually had no enemies. Only in the early years, her husband founded an afternoon newspaper, which was later shut down, affecting a printing house, which was also closed down. It is possible that this was the reason for the kidnapping, to vent their anger.</p>
<h3>Four Robbers Loot a Huge Sum of Money on Avenue Road, Shanghai West Yesterday</h3>
<p>Loss of 4,700 Yuan</p>
<p>▲ At the home of Tang Afu, a foreman at an American arts and crafts company</p>
<p>▲ Four robbers looted for two hours</p>
<p>▲ "We don't want clothes, we want valuable jewelry"</p>
<p>▲ The entire family of six was confined to the back room</p>
<p>At 10:30 AM yesterday, four robbers came to the home of Tang Fusheng, a local resident living at No. 1187 Qianshan Lane on Avenue Road in western Shanghai. Three of the robbers had pistols, and all were wearing short black Xiangyunsha shirts and spoke with a northern accent. Tang's nanny was having breakfast in the kitchen and asked them what they wanted. They said they were there to collect wages from Tang Afu. The nanny didn't think much of it and let them in. The robbers went into the side rooms and saw Tang's wife combing her hair. They immediately pulled out a pistol, pressed it against Tang's wife's waist, and searched and looted the jewelry placed on the table first. They then ordered Tang's wife to take off the watch on her wrist. The woman, being a woman, did not dare to resist. The robbers, fearing that others would find out, confined Tang's wife, three maids, an older sister, and a child to the back room, tying their wrists with ropes and fastening them to the bedposts, with one robber watching over them, not allowing them to make a sound. Then they stuffed rice bags in the doorway, making it very secure. The three robbers then went upstairs to search and loot, taking away gold and silver jewelry worth about 500 to 600 yuan, and 65 yuan in cash. After the three robbers finished searching, they went to the back room downstairs and said to Tang's wife, "It's already 12 o'clock, and your husband hasn't come home with the money yet. We have to wait for him to come before we leave," etc. Tang was working as a carpentry foreman at the American Arts and Crafts Company on Jing'an Temple Road. Yesterday was the day to distribute wages to the workers, so he went to the HSBC Bank on the Bund to withdraw 4,100 yuan in cash, and the American Arts and Crafts Company car sent him to the entrance of Qianshan Lane on Avenue Road. After the car left, Tang Afu arrived at his doorstep, the door slightly ajar. As Tang stepped inside, the robbers pulled out their pistols and pressed them against his chest and back, taking away all 4,100 yuan in cash he was carrying. They also confined Tang to the inner room. The four robbers then leisurely escaped. This happened at 12:30 PM. Afterwards, Tang Afu reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, who sent detectives to investigate and conduct a strict search.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Burned Opium in Pudong Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Worth Over 163,000 Silver Dollars</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs held a public burning of opium in Lujiazui, Pudong, yesterday. At 9:00 AM, Customs Warehouse Manager Robert, Tax Commissioner Ge Yixin on behalf of the Customs Superintendent, and Chinese and Western customs officials escorted more than 50 sacks of opium, numbered in sequence, to Pudong. After weighing, checking, and verifying that everything was correct, the firemen simultaneously lit the coal in the one or two-liang kilns. The burning began at 9:30 AM and ended at 10:45 AM. A total of 5,131 catties and four taels of opium were burned (excluding 30 taels that were sent to Huzhou for medicinal purposes according to a letter from the Supervisory Office), as well as 200 taels and five mace of morphine, morphine pills (estimated to be worth about 729 silver dollars), and more than 800 catties of poppy shells (which were seized for being declared as medicinal materials upon import). In addition, there was a wooden box of obscene books (titled "History of Sexuality"), which was also burned. The above-mentioned prohibited drugs were seized from various ships during the three-month period from March 21 to June 20 of this year, totaling an estimated value of 163,370 silver dollars. The observers present that day included Ye Liangguang from the Songhu Garrison Command, Yang Peiwen from the City Party Department, Section Chief Liang from the Supervisory Office, Wang Zhizhong from the Shanghai Local Court, Han Chao from the Special District Local Court, Zhang Mingqin, the third district chief of the City Public Security Bureau, Cheng Zhichao from the County Public Security Bureau, Ji Shiying from the Anti-Drug Association, and Shen Chuanyang, among others. During the burning, a platoon of armed policemen from the Third District took care of the area around the kilns to provide protection.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Soar</h3>
<p>▲ How are ordinary people supposed to live?</p>
<p>Recently, the sources of rice in both the northern and southern rice markets in the city have been lacking, causing prices to gradually rise. The highest price for white japonica rice has actually risen to 23 yuan per stone. After the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau, together with the Rice Industry Association, strictly prohibited the price increase, limiting it to no more than 21 yuan per stone. In recent days, although there has been no overpricing on the surface, the sources of goods from various rural areas have almost disappeared, and even general stockpiling warehouses are not selling, resulting in a large shortage in the rice shops in the British and French Concessions. Therefore, the selling price in recent days has risen sharply, with top-grade white japonica rice costing 23 yuan and 34 cents per stone, second-grade white japonica rice costing over 22 yuan per stone, and third-grade rice costing 21 yuan per stone. As a result, the general poor and small business operators are all crying out in despair, their faces full of worry.</p>
<h3>Fine Arts Technician Chen Boying Throws Himself into the River</h3>
<p>▲ Did not know what moved him</p>
<p>▲ Suddenly jumped into the clear stream</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM on the 6th, a corpse floated on the surface of the Xinzha Bridge River. Chen A'da, a boatman on a rescue boat, caught a glimpse of it and tried to pull it up, carrying it to the Qiliu Public Office in Zhabei. A train watch, two business cards of a manager from a rubber company, and a pair of steel scissors were found on his body. He was wearing a white striped silk gown and white canvas running shoes, and his lower body was naked. There were no wounds. The Tongren Fuyuan Branch embalmed the body and transported it to the Beicai Township Cemetery in Pudong for burial. At 9:00 AM today, a relative of the deceased, Yu Mou, came to identify the body after hearing the news and took back the belongings. The details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ The History of the Deceased. Chen Boying, a native of Suzhou, was 23 years old. He was a fine artist, known for his exceptional skills. At the age of 15, he studied at the Fine Arts Department of the Zhabei Commercial Press under the famous technician Lu Xiuyun as an apprentice. Before a year had passed, Lu went to Hong Kong due to an event and transferred Boying to his close friend Xu Xingyuan to learn the art. Chen was young, handsome, and extremely intelligent. At the age of 18, he left Xu and started working on his own as a fine arts contractor, earning more than 100 yuan a month. Later, he was hired by the Far East Rubber Company and became a technician in the drawing department. Recently, due to disagreements with his colleagues, he angrily resigned. He was then hired by the China Rubber Printing Company as a technician and was scheduled to report to work yesterday, Monday.</p>
<p>▲ Family Situation. Chen Peiqing, a deceased famous doctor from Suzhou, was Chen Boying's ancestor. The family had meager property. When Chen was 12 years old, his parents passed away one after another. Only three sisters remained in the family, so Boying relied on his two sisters to support him. Learning fine arts was also introduced by his sister, Chen.</p>
<p>▲ Disliked Old Marriage. When Chen was one year old, his eldest sister, Chen, and his uncle Chen Mou betrothed him to a woman surnamed Zhang from Huzhou. At that time, 200 yuan was offered as a betrothal gift. At that time, Chen was quite dissatisfied with the ugly appearance of his fiancée and firmly opposed the old-style marriage system. He asked his sister to cancel the engagement, otherwise he would commit suicide immediately. His sister, fearing that he would cause trouble, managed to cancel the engagement with the Zhang family.</p>
<p>▲ Immediately Engaged. After the engagement was cancelled, Boying suddenly met Hou Gendi, the second daughter of a tofu shop owner surnamed Hou, who lived on Caojia Road, Fangbang Bridge in the city. They fell in love and made a lifelong commitment to each other. They also hired Hou Shunxing, a relative of the Chen family, as a matchmaker, and held a betrothal ceremony in February of this year. The gift money spent was over 1,000 yuan, and the formal marriage was scheduled for October 24 of this year.</p>
<p>▲ Reasons for Resignation. Two years ago, Boying was introduced by his friend Zhou Chaoliu to the Far East Rubber Printing Company at the entrance of Zhangjia Lane as a fine arts technician. Due to his exquisite art, he was highly valued by Wang Zhongyao, the manager of the company. His colleagues were also harmonious. Recently, the company hired a new factory director, He Fahai, who unreasonably prohibited smoking and spitting. Boying disagreed and tore down the notice. The factory director became estranged from Boying because of this. Seeing this, Boying repeatedly resigned to the manager. Although the manager repeatedly tried to retain him, he finally resigned on June 30.</p>
<p>▲ Seeking Another Job. After Chen Boying resigned from the Far East, he was hired by Qian Shenquan, the manager of the China Rubber Printing Company at No. 8 Renheli, Baike Road, and was scheduled to report to work on the 7th. Unexpectedly, Boying did not go until today. The manager was very anxious because all the orders were approaching the deadline. Suspicion arose, and he asked the introducer about the reason, and only then did he discover that Boying had thrown himself into the river and committed suicide.</p>
<p>▲ Borrowing Money from Sister. Around 8:00 PM on the 4th, Boying suddenly went to his sister's husband Yu Pisheng's house at No. 8 Dingxing Lane, Caojiadu, and borrowed 4 yuan from his sister. His sister, being inconvenient, only gave him 2 yuan before he left. Unexpectedly, this departure would be forever.</p>
<p>▲ Aftermath of Death. Yesterday, after the rescue boat pulled him up from Xinzha Bridge, relatives came to identify the body after hearing the news. However, the body had already been buried in Pudong, so the Qiliu Public Office, together with the Fuyuan Hall, sent someone to accompany the relatives to Pudong to collect the coffin and transport it back to their hometown. At the same time, his sister said that the expenses of Boying's engagement were all borrowed by her, and now that Boying had suddenly committed suicide, the creditors would inevitably demand payment. Therefore, she consulted the original matchmaker to ask the woman's family to return the betrothal gift to make up for the loss. However, the reason for Boying's drowning in the river is still unclear.</p>
<h3>Ignorant Villager Loses His Life</h3>
<p>▲ Believed to be haunted by a ghost due to malaria</p>
<p>▲ Drowned while jumping into the water to scare away the ghost</p>
<p>Li Daoxian, a native of Anhui, worked in a weaving factory behind Nanyang Public School on Longhua Road. Recently, Li often slept outdoors due to the hot weather, which caused cold air to enter his body, resulting in a severe cold and turning into malaria. He suffered terribly every afternoon when it came on. However, Li was simple-minded and deeply superstitious. Instead of seeking fundamental treatment, he said that malaria must have a malaria ghost. Therefore, he used superstitious methods to drive it away, such as staying overnight in temples and crossing bridges, but these unconscious actions were ineffective. He didn't know how, but he came up with a plan, believing that he could scare away the malaria ghost. He thought that when malaria strikes, the ghost must be attached to the body, so he would jump into the river, and the ghost, fearing drowning, would not dare to follow. Then he would swim to the other side, and the ghost would be removed. Therefore, the afternoon before last, when malaria struck, he rushed to the river outside the door and jumped into the water. Unexpectedly, he was weak and unable to swim to the other side. It was easy to enter the water but difficult to get out, and he could not climb up the riverbank, so he sank to the bottom of the river and drowned. The malaria ghost was not driven away, and he himself became a drowned ghost. His colleagues found out and salvaged him, but when he was pulled up yesterday morning, he had already died. The police station investigated the matter and ordered Zhang Liqing, the head of the 27th Bao and the local security guard, to report to the local court. Prosecutor Zhao and others arrived at the scene, verified that he had drowned, and ordered the body to be embalmed.</p>
<h3>Negotiating with Japanese Merchants Who Refuse to Pay Summer Resort Rent Donations</h3>
<p>Japanese merchants, such as the Yokohama Specie Bank, often go to</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Mount Jigong for summer vacation every year, but they refuse to pay the rent donation for the houses, resulting in huge arrears. Although the parties concerned have repeatedly demanded payment, it has been of no avail. Yesterday, in order to protect the rights of its citizens, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs specially instructed the Shanghai Office to send a letter to the Japanese Consul General to negotiate, requesting that the Japanese merchants be ordered to quickly pay off the arrears of summer resort rent donations on Mount Jigong and complete the formalities, so as to avoid other unfortunate events.</p>
<h3>Continued Arrest of Robbery Case Suspects</h3>
<p>According to the Dagong Evening News, the Public Concession Police have obtained confessions from suspects arrested in the Junpu Bureau's robbery of the Lifay Ferry, and sent detectives to Singapore last week to hunt down the remaining gang members. Currently, the instigator A'gen and the famous gang leader Changmao Jinsheng, as well as the suspect A'long, have not been apprehended. According to the confession of Zhang Genbao, who was arrested the other day, he once gave A'gen 800 yuan, instructing him to buy a ticket to Singapore. This was the last time he met A'long, and it is expected that those people have already taken a boat south. According to reports, immediately after the case occurred on May 30, the Lao Zha Police Station arrested 17 suspects that night, and 13 of them were released after being investigated and found to be innocent. The remaining four were transferred to the Shanghai Local Court. Two days later, the Water Patrol Police arrested a coolie and an old woman in Pudong, confiscated bags of foreign cloth hidden in their possession, and also transferred them to the Shanghai Local Court. On the 18th of last month, the police arrested three more people who confessed to the robbery, and Zhang Genbao was one of them.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau Planning to Open a Self-Flowing Well in Hutang Port, Pudong</h3>
<p>Residents in the Muddy Ferry area of Pudong urgently need clean drinking water. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, following the instructions of the Municipal Government, has submitted a plan to the government for approval to build a water plant. However, during the previous filling of the Hutang Port in that area by the Municipal Public Works Bureau, the project was suspended at the request of the Pudong Fire Brigade due to fire water considerations. Since both ends of the port have been blocked and impassable, the water quality is becoming increasingly foul. Local people have requested that the port be completely filled and a self-flowing well be dug to provide drinking water and benefit fire prevention. All matters related to filling the port will still be carried out by the Public Works Bureau according to the original plan. Regarding the excavation of the self-flowing well, the Public Utilities Bureau has drafted a plan and submitted it to the Municipal Government for referral to the Finance Bureau for review. It is reported that the Finance Bureau also considers this to be essential and intends to limit the initial cost to 4,000 yuan and the recurring cost to 400 yuan. The Municipal Government has approved the plan. Currently, the Public Utilities Bureau is preparing a budget to solicit bids. It is said that the location for the well has been surveyed by the bureau and is located on the vacant lot next to No. 16105 Muddy Ferry Main Street.</p>
<h3>[Vitamin B] is Born</h3>
<p>▲ Created by the China Industrial Chemical Research Institute.  There are five types of vitamins, which are the main ingredients in human nutrients. Our country has not yet seen any creations. Now, the China Industrial Chemical Research Institute has created a type of [Vitamin B] after a long period of research and improvement. According to scientists' tests, in addition to specifically treating beriberi, this substance can also [nourish the brain], [increase appetite], [treat neuritis], [relax muscles and promote blood circulation, and help development]. It is said that the [Vitamin B] produced by the institute is of excellent quality. After tests by the Medical School of the National Central University and various doctors, it has been very effective. It is now being manufactured by the Weiyi Company and will soon be contributed to society.</p>
<h3>Prohibit the Yu Lan Festival of the Zhongyuan Festival</h3>
<p>Residents in the north and south of the city, every year during the Zhongyuan Festival, usually pool funds to hire monks and Taoists to build the Yu Lan Festival, providing relief to lonely souls without descendants, causing distress to the people and wasting money. In this era of vigorously eliminating superstition, although the Yamen has repeatedly issued orders, foolish men and women still outwardly comply but inwardly disobey. Director Yuan of the Municipal Public Security Bureau believes that the Zhongyuan Festival is approaching in the blink of an eye, and he is deeply afraid that residents will still hire monks and Taoists to set up altars and build temples. Therefore, he has specially ordered the team leaders of the north and south districts to instruct the policemen to strictly investigate and prohibit superstition. If there are any situations such as falsely claiming the Yu Lan Festival and donating funds to build temples, they are allowed to detain and punish the leaders as a warning to others.</p>
<h3>The Huang Gong Vegetables Store's Rental Dispute Case with the Continental Company</h3>
<p>The Continental Shoe Company at the corner of Sanma Road and Guangxi Road previously leased a part of the house from the Huang Gong Xin Ji Vegetables Store as a business office. There was a lease agreement for a period of three years. However, at the time of signing the contract, it was the Da Zhonghua Shoe Company. Later, the Social Affairs Bureau instructed Da Zhonghua to change its name to Continental, because there was already a Da Zhonghua with that name. After Huang Gong Xin Ji changed to Yi Xie Ji, Continental paid the rent as usual. At that time, Huang Gong had no objections. When Continental paid the second month's rent, they refused to accept it and first notified Continental with a lawyer's letter, ordering them to move immediately, and filed a lawsuit in the Special District Court. This case was heard on the 3rd of this month. Because it could not be resolved, a second hearing was held at 9:00 AM yesterday. First, the plaintiff stated the reasons for terminating the lease and expanding, saying that the defendant and Huang Gong Xin Ji signed the lease when it was Da Zhonghua and not Continental, Da Zhonghua had ceased operations for a while and transferred it to Continental, etc. Then the defendant stated that the plaintiff's statement was inconsistent with the facts. Da Zhonghua was never registered with the Social Affairs Bureau and never operated. The instruction to change its name was out of necessity, and they presented the Social Affairs Bureau's instruction as evidence. The court ruled that the Continental's evidence was conclusive, and ruled that the plaintiff could not force the eviction and would bear the litigation costs.</p>
<h3>Medical Dispute Case Appeal Judgment</h3>
<p>▲ Lu Yuanlei's appeal rejected.  Lu Yuanlei, the director of academic affairs of the Guoyi College on Avenue Joffre last semester, filed an appeal in the Appeals Court of the Special District for the insult case against Jiankang Bao. At 2:00 PM yesterday, Judge Sun Yuan specially opened the First Criminal Court for questioning. Lu was previously criticized by the newspaper for having shallow medical knowledge, absurd and chaotic theories, and a fondness for causing trouble. He had repeatedly caused disturbances in the Chinese Medicine School and the Chinese Medical College, and his behavior was improper. After Lu Yuanlei was attacked by the newspaper, all his patients and students' families lost faith in him, and he suffered great losses in his life and could not survive, so he filed a lawsuit, accusing the editor-in-chief of the newspaper and demanding 24,000 yuan in damages for reputation. The defendant then produced manuscripts from medical journals all over the country criticizing Lu's theories to prove that his theories were absurd, and there were also witnesses and evidence from various medical schools to prove that he had repeatedly caused disturbances. The first instance judgment rejected Lu's complaint and acquitted the defendant. Lu refused to accept the judgment and appealed. The defendant hired lawyer Xi Yafu to represent him. The court summoned the four professors Yu Hongxun, Xu Yaotang, Tang Yimin, and Dai Daifu mentioned in Rui Da Wu's previous testimony. Yu and others stated that Lu Yuanlei caused disputes because his request for a raise was not granted. The director resigned as a result and did not ask about school affairs. After Lu left office, the disturbances subsided. Bao Shisheng, the president of the Chinese Medical College, and Qin Bomei, the director, also arrived, proving the situation of the disturbances in the college, all of which were initiated by Lu Yuanlei, stirring up the disturbances and leading the students to form their own Guoyi College, etc., proving that the newspaper's report was accurate. Regarding the point that Lu's theories were absurd, Lu himself had already admitted and abandoned the appeal. The prosecutor then made a statement, and the court announced that the original judgment of the first instance was upheld, and the defendant was acquitted. Lu Yuanlei's appeal was rejected.</p>
<h3>Wang Xizhi Steals a Goose and Gets Caught</h3>
<p>A resident surnamed Mei on Wusong Outer Road raised two white geese. At around 4:00 PM yesterday, a Jiangbei vagrant nicknamed Wang Xizhi (original name Xizi) passed by and saw two geese standing on the roadside. Seeing that no one was around, he suddenly had the idea of loving geese, so he stepped forward, grabbed the two geese, and hid them in his waist, running away. The housewife saw it and tracked him down, shouting "Catch the thief!" Passersby helped chase and catch him. When his clothes were untied and searched, two white geese weighing about four or five catties were found on his chest. The housewife initially wanted to call the police to arrest him, but then slapped him twice and let him escape. The onlookers laughed and called Wang Xizhi a goose lover, which can be said to be a rare occurrence.</p>
<h3>Stores Not Affixing Stamps Are Fined</h3>
<p>The Chinese shops and stores in the Public Concession have been repeatedly notified by the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau and the competent court to purchase and affix stamps in accordance with the stamp tax regulations, but there are still many who outwardly comply but inwardly disobey. The bureau has specially sent investigators to investigate everywhere. If any are found, they will be prosecuted by the police to uphold the law and increase tax revenue. Now it has been found that the Yipinxiang Hotel, the Da Zhonghua Restaurant on Tibet Road, the Bailing Wallpaper Company, the Hua Xin Company on Nanjing Road, the Quanjiafu Restaurant on Guangxi Road, the Fengsheng Noodle Shop on Fujian Road, the Wantai Coal Shop on Wusong Road, the Yuchang Watch Shop on Shanxi Road, and the Niuzhong Hardware Store on North Suzhou Road, all of which did not affix stamps to their invoices. These shops are not small shops, and it seems that they should not be reluctant to pay these small stamp taxes and violate the official notices. Therefore, evidence has been collected and the police have been informed to file a public prosecution with the Special District Court. At yesterday morning's hearing, except for Wantai, who failed to appear, the rest sent people to the case. Under the interrogation of Luo Renji, the four defendants, Yipinxiang, Da Zhonghua, Wantai, and Fengsheng, still needed to be investigated, and they were instructed to wait for a rescheduled hearing. The Bailing Wallpaper Company was sentenced to a fine of 20 yuan, and the remaining four defendants, Hua Xin, Quanjiafu, Yuchang, and Niuzhong, were each fined 30 yuan and released after paying the fine.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Donghan Bili Road</h3>
<p>▲ One robber shot dead on Wuzhou Road.  At around 1:30 PM yesterday, a robbery occurred in Yongxiang Lane, Donghan Bili Road, Hongkou. Three robbers escaped from inside and were chased by the police. One robber was shot and killed near the Xiaocaichang vegetable market on Wuzhou Road. The body was sent to the coroner's office for an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Yangshupu Road</h3>
<p>At around 1:30 PM yesterday, five robbers suddenly came to the Qin family's home at No. 209 Xinkang Lane, Yangshupu Road. Three of them had pistols and spoke with a northern accent. They robbed over 300 yuan in cash and over 3,000 yuan in jewelry, and fled.</p>
<h3>Careless Fire at a Shed on Jungong Road</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 3:55 AM, a grass shed near Hujiang University on Jungong Road in East Shanghai, occupied by villager Yao Jinsheng, suddenly caught fire. Thick smoke filled the air, and flames soared. The Yangshupu Fire Brigade received the alarm and rushed to the scene. However, due to the lack of fire hydrants in the area, firefighting was difficult. Eventually, a small stream was located, and water was pumped and sprayed with great effort. The fire was finally extinguished at 5:30 AM. Six grass huts were destroyed, and many livestock, including pigs and sheep, were burned to death. It is reported that the losses were substantial.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Boat Sinks in Storm</h3>
<p>A boat named "Dong Er Hao," traveling from Shanghai to Songjiang the day before yesterday, was carrying a large cargo of bean cakes. Due to overloading, it sank near the Du Family Wharf in the South Huangpu River. All twenty-plus people on board fell into the water. Fortunately, most were good swimmers and managed to swim to the shore. A passing boat came to their rescue, saving several crew members. Several crew members are still missing. It is reported that in addition to the bean cakes, the boat also carried valuable foreign goods such as Xiangyun gauze, which floated on the surface of the water. Local villagers salvaged a considerable amount. A boat has been hired to salvage the sunken vessel. It is said that the bean cakes absorbed water and expanded, causing the boat to burst. The water police have been notified for protection.</p>
<h3>Violent Incident at a Stove Shop on Jiaozhou Road</h3>
<p>Around 8:40 PM the day before yesterday, a group of over a hundred people, resembling laborers, gathered at a stove shop on Jiaozhou Road in West Shanghai. With a loud shout, they began to fight, causing chaos with fists and kicks. Patrol officers Liu Mingshan and others from the 6th District Police Station on Singapore Road arrived and bravely intervened, arresting the perpetrators. The accomplices scattered and fled. The ringleaders, Cao Jinkun, Cao Youming, Ji Taoli, and the injured Shen Guisen were taken to the 6th District Police Station. After questioning by District Chief Ren, Shen Guisen, 26, from Taixing, residing in a flat in Yaojiabang and working as a chopstick maker, stated that while drinking tea at the stove shop, he jokingly argued with Cao Jinkun and others, who ran the shop. Unexpectedly, they gathered over a hundred accomplices and beat him severely. The police arrived in time to prevent him from being beaten to death, but he sustained injuries to his head, body, and waist. Cao Jinkun, 38, from Tongzhou, residing at 28 Jiaozhou Road and running the stove shop, claimed that he was operating the stove shop for a living. Cao Youming, 42, residing at the same address, and Ji Taoli, 25, from Taizhou, residing on Jiaozhou Road and working at a flatbread shop, offered evasive answers. District Chief Ren, after obtaining their statements, deemed the case to involve a mob causing injury and yesterday prepared documents to transfer them to the local court for investigation.</p>
<h3>County Public Security Bureau Arrests Robbers</h3>
<p>▲Yang Futang and Xiaolin</p>
<p>Detective Gu Xingzhou of the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau recently apprehended Shi Yuting, a habitual robber involved in multiple robberies. The detective was ordered to present evidence to the Special District Court for a preliminary hearing, and then bring him back to the Chinese-controlled government office for trial. After receiving the order, the detective has been collecting evidence. It has now been discovered that Shi Yuting and his gang went to Chongming a month ago to commit robbery. They were stopped by police who found two handguns and took them to the Chongming County government for interrogation. Two important accomplices in the case were identified as Yang Futang and Xiaolin. Director Shen was informed, and he requested that the county government issue a warrant for their transfer. Yesterday, the detective, along with an informant, went to Chongming to bring them back for investigation.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshadu Road: Murderous Robbers Apprehended</h3>
<p>On May 30th of this year, at 11 PM, four robbers broke into the home of Wang A’jin at 600 Xiaoshadu Road in West Shanghai. Each carrying a handgun, they threatened the residents into silence. As they were about to search for valuables, Wang A’jin, unwilling to give up his possessions, shouted for help. The robbers fired several shots, killing Wang instantly. The robbers, fearing capture, fled without stealing anything. Afterward, Xu Xixiang and others living in the same house reported the incident to the local police station, who transported Wang’s body to the morgue for examination. The officials ordered a coffin and instructed the police to investigate. Over a month later, detectives Ji Liren and Ma Zonglai from the Putuo Road Police Station, along with French and Chinese police in the French Concession and Zhabei, apprehended the main suspects, Lu Yi and Xu Rennian (nicknamed Jiuzi), both from Jiangbei. Yesterday, they were handed over to Judge Wu Tingqi of the Special District Court for questioning. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated that there were still accomplices at large and requested a postponement until all suspects could be apprehended, investigated, and punished. Judge Wu briefly questioned the two defendants, Lu and Xu, and ordered them to be detained for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Large Quantity of Opium Seized</h3>
<p>▲Each Fined 500 Yuan</p>
<p>Last Saturday (the 5th), detectives Shi Baoying and Ruan Taibin of the Huishan Police Station received information that opium traffickers would be transporting a large quantity of opium at the Gonghexiang Wharf on Broadway at midnight that night. The two detectives went to the vicinity of the wharf to wait. Around 11:45 PM, five or six people appeared and unloaded three burlap sacks from a foreign ship. They began to carry the sacks, intending to load them onto rickshaws. Detectives Shi and Ruan questioned them about the contents of the sacks. The group abandoned the sacks and fled, but the detectives arrested Ningbo native Yu Jinfang and Pudong native Du Yousheng, along with the three sacks. Upon inspection, the sacks contained forty-four packages of opium, weighing a total of 2,760 taels. Valued at the time, the opium was worth approximately 6,000 gold yuan. Yesterday, they were handed over to the Special District Court for investigation. Yu and Du claimed they were shipyard workers at the old shipyard at the wharf, and two strangers forced them at gunpoint to transport the sacks. Judge Feng fined each of them 500 yuan. If they could not pay, they would be imprisoned for one day for every two yuan owed. The opium was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Unidentified Male Corpse in Pudong</h3>
<p>Around 3 PM yesterday afternoon, an unidentified male corpse was found floating near the Hua Tong Wharf of the Taikoo Company in Pudong. The body was wearing blue cloth shirt and pants, blue cloth shoes, no socks, and had a shaved head. The man appeared to be in his twenties, and seemed to be a pier labourer. It is possible that he fell into the river by accident while resting at the pier in the evening. Patrolman No. 15 of the River Patrol Police Station retrieved the body and took it back to the police station, where it will be handed over to the Rescue Bureau for disposal.</p>
<h3>Distribution of Guanyin Emergency Relief and Security Water</h3>

It is safe for pregnant women and specifically treats severe cholera with vomiting and diarrhea. Those suffering from the illness can obtain a bottle at the temple free of charge. Many people have sought it out.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau Letter to Xiangya Factory</h3>
<p>▲To Correct the Factory's Defense</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau sent a letter to the Xiangya Factory yesterday, stating: "We have read Mr. Lin Zhetong's letter to the Shen Bao on the 7th of this month, in which he defends the actions of your factory's executives in preventing workers from receiving free cholera vaccinations. The wording is inaccurate and unworthy of discussion. However, because these executives have awakened from their error after being questioned by this Bureau and now realize that preventing workers from being vaccinated is inappropriate, they are attempting to evade responsibility with excuses. While this is a violation of honesty, it does demonstrate a desire for improvement. Therefore, we must further correct the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The medical personnel dispatched by this Bureau to administer free vaccinations are all qualified and have undergone extensive training. The person sent to your factory on July 2nd is a graduate of the former Beijing Medical College, served as a military doctor for many years, and has received training. Therefore, he undoubtedly possesses the basic knowledge of disinfecting needles and cleaning the skin with alcohol before injection. Since the fall of 1927, this Bureau has been promoting various free vaccinations, benefiting over 800,000 people, and there has never been a case of infection due to vaccination. This shows that this Bureau's medical personnel disinfect properly during injections. There is no need to create excuses to evade responsibility.</p>
<p>(2) This Bureau's procedures for cholera vaccinations, including the list of required materials, have long specified disinfection and prevention of infection. These procedures are distributed to all personnel administering vaccinations, and they are required to follow them. The Bureau had already considered this issue before your factory's suggestion.</p>
<p>(3) This Bureau has repeatedly issued public notices promoting free vaccinations and has collaborated with the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Social Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, and the Education Bureau to inform all factories and organizations that refusal is not permitted. Advertisements have also been placed on the front pages of various newspapers to ensure widespread awareness. Your factory cannot claim ignorance.</p>
<p>(4) Your factory should be responsible for preventing disease among its workers. This Bureau is providing free vaccinations, and anyone with a modern understanding of enterprise trends should offer their full support. While a mistake may have been made, the ability to correct it is commendable and does not require justification. In the coming days, we will dispatch medical personnel to your factory again to administer free cholera vaccinations to workers. We hope you will instruct all workers to receive the vaccination to avoid infection.</p>
<p>This letter is addressed to the Xiangya Factory."</p>

We request that you give these matters serious attention, so depositors will not experience hardship from the bank's closure."</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Registration of Bank Branches</h3>
<p>▲Opinions of a Certain Official of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>Since the issue of foreign merchant registration arose in this port, it has attracted the attention of merchants from various countries. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has also drafted eight supplementary measures for foreign merchant registration, which have been announced. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency interviewed an official from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday regarding the registration of foreign and Chinese bank branches. According to the official, foreign stores should be treated equally with Chinese merchants and be subject to the company registration rules. When asked whether the various bank branches that have recently been established in this city have registered with the ministry, the official replied that he did not know. However, he personally believes that while the head offices of the banks have already registered with the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance, the branches should also be registered in accordance with the law. If they have not yet registered, the banks are in violation of the law, and those who conduct transactions with them have no security. In the event of an incident, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, as the highest industrial and commercial administrative authority, will only enforce the law.</p>
<h3>Strictly Prohibit the Private Sale of Inferior Summer Silkworm Seeds</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government recently approved a public letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Sericulture Control Office, stating that the Jiangsu Provincial Temporary Regulations for the Control of Silkworm Seed Industry and the Implementing Rules have been promulgated by the Department of Agriculture and Mining and that the office has been strictly ordered to enforce the regulations and not to show any leniency. Recently, it has been heard that improved summer silkworm seeds without the required inspection stamp have been discovered in rural areas of various counties. This is clearly due to unscrupulous individuals seeking personal gain by selling inferior seeds, which violates Article 11 of the Temporary Regulations, which prohibits the sale or transfer of silkworm seeds without a certificate of conformity. This is a blatant disregard for the law and harms silkworm farmers. In addition to sending personnel to conduct secret investigations and issuing notices to villagers not to buy inferior seeds, the county government has been urged to order an investigation and strict punishment. Yesterday, County Chief Yan instructed all district chiefs to inform the villagers that if they encounter anyone privately selling improved silkworm seeds without a certificate of conformity, they should report the name, address, and type of inferior seed or eggshell to the office for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>All City Merchants Should Unanimously Use National Products</h3>
<p>▲City Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Trades to Comply</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday notified all trade associations: "On June 21st, the former Chamber of Commerce Consolidation Association convened a general meeting of members' representatives from all trades in the city. Wu Xingji, a representative of the silk and satin industry, proposed that all city merchant associations be notified to encourage merchants to use national products. The proposal was resolved and referred to this Chamber for implementation. The proposal was resolved at the second standing committee meeting on the 7th of this month to be followed up. Promoting national products is the foundation for developing industry and commerce and is indirectly related to the national economy and people's livelihood. Now that gold prices are soaring and imported goods are becoming increasingly expensive, if we do not make every effort to promote national products, capital flight will increase and the country will soon become impoverished. Therefore, we are issuing this special notice, hoping that you will comply with it."</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Encourages the Use of Domestically Produced Alcohol and Beverages</h3>
<p>▲Letter to the Liquor, Food, and Vegetable Trade Association</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Liquor, Food, and Vegetable Trade Association yesterday, stating: "On the 5th of this month, we received a telegram from the Shantou City Chamber of Commerce's Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association, which stated: 'The import of foreign alcohol exceeds tens of millions of gold dollars annually, which is also a form of economic aggression. The Yantai Changyu Company is one of our country's few real enterprises, with strong capital and a large scale. Since its founding by Zhang Bishi, it has had a history of over forty years and a long-standing reputation. Since Zhang Jianshi took over as general manager last year, he has made further improvements, imitating Western methods to produce Golden Star Brandy and red and white wine, which are pure in quality and taste and no less than imported products, and the prices are also reasonable. Since our association and others have worked together to promote them in Chaoshan and the municipal government has announced that Chinese alcohol and beverages must be used at all public and private banquets, sales have been brisk. We have always admired your association's efforts to maintain national products and spare no effort. We dare to ask you to promote them unanimously to stop capital outflow, which is our hope, and to send a reply.' In recent banquets, the trend is to use foreign alcohol to entertain guests, while domestic famous alcohol is rejected, resulting in capital outflow of thousands of gold, which is deeply regrettable. The Changyu Winery is a pioneer in our country in imitating foreign alcohol, and its products have been further improved in recent years, which is sufficient to cater to the psychology of Chinese consumers and recover capital outflow. However, we believe that the city's banquets are closely related to your industry. To reverse the habit of customers using imported alcohol, your industry must first adopt domestically produced alcohol and beverages in large quantities, showing that the quality and taste are the same and the price is lower, and advising customers to use domestically produced alcohol and beverages, which is a sign of respect. Then, gradually and imperceptibly, it will be easy to reverse this trend. Therefore, we are sending this special letter to you, hoping that you will investigate and promote it sincerely. This reply is to be used for your reply."</p>
<h3>French Water and Electricity Workers' Strike Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Mass Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, over six hundred striking workers from the French Water and Electricity Company held a general membership meeting at the Dajilu Public Stadium. Xu Yefu, representing the City Party Headquarters, attended to provide guidance. The meeting was chaired by Xu Amei, and the following issues were discussed:</p>
<p>1. Xu Amei reported on the preparations for resuming work yesterday, such as opening the factory gates, naturally opening the gates when trams leave the factory, and removing posted notices. New workers and White Russians are still working at the factory and cannot be expelled. However, it is not certain whether work will resume, whether the strike will continue, or whether the formal signing of a recognition agreement by the management is required before work can resume. She asked for the views of the members. By raising hands, the members resolved not to sign the agreement and not to resume work, but to persist to the end. Xu Amei also said that the City Party Headquarters had not sent a representative to attend the meeting or handle the resumption of work, which raised concerns. She asked Comrade Xu Yefu to attend and provide guidance.</p>
<p>2. Xu Yefu, representing the City Party Headquarters, said: "Brothers, I must explain two points today. First, the City Party Headquarters heard that this strike was being mediated by private individuals and therefore did not deem it appropriate to participate and attend. Second, my attendance at your meeting is by order of the City Party Headquarters, representing the City Party Headquarters. Without the order of the City Party Headquarters, I could not attend as a private individual. As for your resumption of work, whether it is mediated by private individuals or the factory management allows workers to resume work automatically, the City Party Headquarters is very willing."</p>
<h3>He Huaiyuan Will Be Sailing Overseas</h3>
<p>▲Going to Work at the Consulate in British Borneo</p>

<h3>City Party Headquarters Schedules Memorial Service for Fan and Guo</h3>
<p>▲Date: July 15th</p>
<p>▲Location: Penglai Grand Theatre</p>
<p>Martyrs Fan Zhengluo and Guo Qingzhao worked hard for the revolution during their lifetimes, which caused them to be resented by the Communists. They were both killed by them. It is reported that the City Executive and Supervisory Committee, in order to commemorate the two martyrs' achievements and encourage future generations, has specially scheduled a grand memorial service at 9 AM on July 15th at the Penglai Grand Theatre in the Old West Gate. The committee's Civil Training Association has been entrusted with preparing everything. Condolences, elegies, wreaths, and other items can be sent to the Civil Training Association for collection before the meeting date.</p>
<h3>Silk Inspection Bureau Holds Secondary Uniform Comparison Inspection</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau's Silk Inspection Bureau, recognizing that evenness inspection is one of the most important aspects of silk quality inspection, has noted that in recent years, the value of silk has been determined by the degree of evenness. However, while there are standards for evenness inspection, they are based on visual assessment. Therefore, the inspection results often vary due to differences in individual eyesight. In order to achieve uniformity, the bureau held its first evenness inspection in mid-April. All silk exporters attended the bureau. As a result, the silk exporters and the Inspection Bureau were in complete agreement. However, the first event was held when new cocoons were on the market, so the silk mills could not participate, which was regrettable. Therefore, the bureau is holding a second inspection. Silk exporters can participate from the 7th to the 12th of this month, Wuxi silk merchants can participate on the 14th and 15th, Shanghai silk mills can participate on the 16th and 17th, and Zhejiang silk mills can participate on the 18th. Notices have already been sent.</p>
<h3>Four Banks Prepare to Issue Reserve Report</h3>

<h3>Robust Import of Foreign Sugar</h3>
<p>Since the sharp rise in gold prices, the import of various imported goods has decreased significantly. Even if there are imports, they are often stacked in customs warehouses without anyone taking delivery. However, the import of foreign sugar has been very robust recently. The reasons for this are: 1. China lacks factories to manufacture and supply it. 2. The daily increase in people's needs. Moreover, due to the weather, the sales of sugar are wider. According to a survey, the recent transaction volume in this port is approximately 120,000 to 130,000 bags per month. The foreign sugar imported in recent days includes 350,000 bags of Java sugar, 90,000 bags of Jiuma sugar, 90,000 bags of Japanese sugar, and 100,000 bags of Luzon sugar, totaling 630,000 bags.</p>

<p>Mother: Children, this morning I gave each of you two oranges and told you to hide them and eat them after dinner. What’s happening now? Eldest son, you haven’t eaten your orange? Second son, you haven’t eaten your orange either?</p>
<p>Eldest Son: Mother, no. But I ate my younger brother’s orange. My younger brother ate my orange.</p>
<p>▲ A: I’m sorry, my wife is sick, and I urgently need to call a doctor. But I'm short of money. Would you lend me five dollars?</p>
<p>B: I’m sorry, I only have five minutes before I have to catch my train. I’ll be gone for five years before I can come back. Let’s talk about your problem then. Goodbye.</p>
<p>▲ A: Mr. D can be considered the best runner in China.</p>
<p>B: Then he will definitely set a new record in the Far Eastern Games and bring back the championship.</p>
<p>A: No, this running is not that running. Last year, he ran away because he owed a large debt. This year, he ran away with the neighbor's daughter.</p>
<p>▲ Young Man: Sir, I have fallen in love with your daughter. I must marry her. She loves me too and has agreed. Please give me your permission.</p>
<p>Old Gentleman: How long have you been in love?</p>
<p>Young Man: From yesterday morning until now.</p>
<h3>Record of Two Girls Drowning</h3>
<p>— Tears on the White Sand</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Men die for wealth, birds die for food." But today, rice is as precious as pearls and firewood as cinnamon. We, the common people, toil like oxen and horses year after year, yet many cannot afford adequate clothing or food. Therefore, people, toiling year after year, risk their lives for food. What about wealth? As witnessed in the tragic drowning of two girls the other day, it makes one feel that the lives of the poor are no better than those of birds, and their lives are almost equal to those of ants. With a heavy heart, I spare no words to record the entire incident.</p>
<p>Across from the Yangshupu Huangpu Wharf, in the area of Wanjiadeng Huo, there is a vast village commonly known as Pudong. The two girls I am recording lived as neighbors there. The older girl was seventeen years old and from Pudong. The younger girl was fifteen years old and from Ningbo. Both worked as factory girls in the Yangshupu spinning mill. When on day shift, they would leave in the morning and return in the evening. When on night shift, they would leave in the evening and return in the morning. They had grown accustomed to this routine for several years, regardless of the weather. To prevent the danger of crossing the river, the factory, whether owned by Chinese or foreigners, had a special small steamer that would wait on the shore at the appointed time to transport workers back and forth. Therefore, those living in Pudong enjoyed its stability and convenience. Many poor women crossed the river to seek a living. However, at around 5:00 PM the other day, a small steamer carrying dozens of people from the opposite bank, all workers reporting for the night shift, approached the pier. Two ships loaded with floral cloth were docked first, so the steamer could not dock. At that time, the third signal for starting work suddenly sounded. The factory girls on the boat became very anxious because they would not be allowed to enter the factory if they were late. Thus, they crowded onto the floral cloth on the floral cloth boat, trying to cross the boat and land ashore. Some were timid and screamed, while others joked and acted up. Suddenly, with a thud, more than a dozen pieces of floral cloth fell into the river. More than ten factory girls fell into the river as well. Fortunately, there were many boatmen who managed to rescue them. A scene of panic and chaos shook the neighborhood. The mothers of the two drowned girls arrived upon hearing the news. Seeing that their daughters were not among those rescued, they secretly rejoiced, thinking that they had already entered the factory. However, after someone confirmed that they had sunk to the bottom of the river, the mothers cried out in grief. Their situation was extremely tragic. But the merciless river was vast and boundless. There was no way to summon their souls or part the water. It was truly helpless. By then, it was already evening. The two old women could only return home with tears. The next morning, the bodies of the two girls had not been washed away by the tide but were floating on the river surface. Perhaps the river god was merciful and lamented their innocence, leaving them there. The boatmen retrieved them. Their faces were still recognizable, but their skin was bluish-purple. Their bellies were swollen as if pregnant. The old women cried even more mournfully upon seeing this. Alas, how tragic! Fortunately, the factory was kind and provided several hundred yuan in relief for funeral expenses. From this, we can see that the proverb "birds die for food" probably refers to these poor common people. As I write this, I cannot help but feel deeply moved.</p>
<h3>Trivial Talks About Lychees</h3>
<p>— Tang Xiumei</p>
<p>Summer brings many fine fruits, and the lychee is especially praised as a superior item. The red fruits hang in clusters, displayed in every market. The price is not cheap. A silver dollar can easily buy a basket. Removing the peel and placing the fruit in a water dish makes it appear exceptionally crystal clear and lovely. Eating it leaves a fragrance on the teeth and lips, with a sweet, juicy taste like nectar. In addition to floating melons and sinking plums, it is another pleasurable experience. Lychees are a type of tall tree. The shape of the tree is round, resembling a canopy. The leaves are usually green and do not wither in winter. They are produced in abundance in the area between the Ba and Xia rivers. They are also found in Fujian and Guangdong. However, due to the slow transportation of Sichuan, they are difficult to transport. Therefore, the lychees sold in the markets are all products from Guangdong and transported through Fujian.</p>
<p>During the Yuanhe reign (806-820 AD), Bai Juyi was banished to Sichuan and wrote a preface to a lychee painting, praising them highly. He said that the color changes in one day, the fragrance changes in two days, and the taste changes in three days. After four or five days, the color, fragrance, and taste are all gone. Those who cannot taste this true flavor from afar often denigrate them, doing injustice to this fine product. Therefore, he painted their image and wrote a preface to describe them. His fondness for them is evident in this. Once they are praised, they are especially precious and valuable. In this age of material civilization, transportation by railways and ships, though far better than in the past, cannot avoid exceeding these number of days either.</p>
<p>According to the Kaiyuan Yishi, Yang Guifei was very fond of this fruit. The central region was thousands of miles away from the production area. Emperor Ming ordered relay horses to transport them day and night. "A courier arrives, raising dust; the royal concubine smiles." Thus, Yang Guifei was greatly pleased. There is also a melody called "Lychee Fragrance" in the musical scores. Elegant anecdotes have been passed down through the ages. Whenever we eat this, we often let our thoughts wander. I wonder if it tastes better than freshly peeled chicken head rice. We should ask Li Sanlang (Emperor Xuanzong).</p>
<h3>Inheritance and Movies</h3>
<p>— Mian Ru</p>
<p>In our country, the custom is that sons inherit their father's property. Recently, the right of women to inherit property has been confirmed, marking a new system. However, in foreign countries, it is determined by the will. Thus, strange and bizarre events occur frequently, sometimes leading to disputes and sometimes to tragic killings. They are also frequently used as material for movies.</p>
<p>In our country, inheritance has become an ominous thing. Recently, there was the dispute of the Sheng family in Wuxi, where one person fell and another rose. The case of Zhang Wenqing murdering his stepmother has also caused a sensation. In addition, there are often occurrences in social news that make people understand the power of money, which is enough to destroy reason and damage emotions.</p>
<p>However, the power of gold is great, and the power of beauty is not small either. At the intersection of wealth and beauty, all surprising, shocking, touching, laughable, and hateful things arise. In Western movies, there are often stories about young men and women who inherit property falling in love. They often deliberately create suspense and crises to give the audience unlimited stimulation and generate intense emotions. For example, the recent movie *Dynamite*, directed by Cecil B. DeMille, tells the story of a girl who inherits property and makes people feel even more excited.</p>
<p>I once read the novel *The Shepherd Boy* (translated by the Commercial Press) and greatly enjoyed its complex and bizarre plot, which is not comparable to plain narration dedicated to describing the love between men and women. The starting point of the entire play is a girl's inheritance of property. The supporting characters are either good, evil, beautiful, ugly, brave, or funny. The grandeur of the background makes the reader feel as if they are abroad, forgetting the noise of the sea. At the time, I thought that if someone could film this book, it would become a grand spectacle.</p>
<p>Now, the Star Film Company has announced that they will film it. It has been renamed *Peach Blossom Lake*. Imagine thousands of peach trees, countless threads of love, the swing of a beautiful woman's axe, and the wounding of a gentleman's body. What is the poignant and alluring scenery on the lake? The other day, I met the director of this film, Zheng Zhengqiu, and he told me about the filming process. I was quite surprised by its greatness. I heard that the entire film has 20 reels, starring Hu Die and Zheng Xiaoqiu. It will be completed soon. After *White Cloud Pagoda*, we will see another successful domestically produced film. As the summer heat spreads, I hope to use the snowfield scenery of Kulun in the film to wash away the heat for movie enthusiasts.</p>
<h3>Reflections on a Trip to the East (1)</h3>
<p>The 9th Far Eastern Games were held in Tokyo, Japan, from May 24th to May 30th. The games lasted for eight days, and the number of visitors reached over 500,000. I was sent by the newspaper to Japan to cover the news of the games. I felt very fortunate to participate in the grand event. I left Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru on May 13th and returned from Shinagawa on the Ryota Maru on June 4th. I spent over twenty days in Japan, passing through Nagasaki, Kobe, Osaka, and Tokyo. Although my business limited me from freely touring the famous scenic spots of the country, what I heard and saw was enough to get a glimpse of the social situation. In recent years, Japan has made rapid progress in everything. The greatness of its construction power, even seen in the Tokyo that has been rebuilt, cannot but be admired. I will write down my observations to show that I will not forget.</p>
<h3>(1) The Shanghai Maru Crossing to the East</h3>
<p>On the morning of May 13th, I boarded the Shanghai Maru to cross to the east. That day, a group of Japanese inspection missions to China also returned home on the same ship. Therefore, there were many people seeing them off at the Waibaidu Bridge pier. The president of the Shanghai Daily News, Mr. Hatabo, has been in Shanghai for nearly twenty years and has many friends. He came to the boat to see me off and introduced me to his acquaintances on the boat. His kindness was very touching. At 9:00 AM, the whistle sounded, and the boat untied its cable and left the port. The music in the boat was loud and pleasing to the ears. The cheers from the pier and the colored paper strips thrown by those seeing off the boat, fluttering in the wind, complemented each other. I only knew the joy of travel and did not feel the pain of parting at all. My life as a reporter, buried under the lamp and running around all day, was also declared free.</p>
<p>The Japan Mail Steamship Company is a state-owned agency. Its routes cover the globe. In recent years, it has added giant ships to sail to Europe and the United States. The Asama Maru, Chichibu Maru, and Ryota Maru are the most notable. The fast ships between Japan and China, running between Kobe, Nagasaki, and Shanghai, are the Shanghai Maru and Nagasaki Maru. Each weighs approximately 5,000 tons and departs every four days. The arrangement in the boat is very complete, divided into first and third class. The price difference is about three times. The first class is further divided into A, B, and C. A is 95 yen, B is 85 yen, and C is 75 yen. All parts of the boat are exceptionally clean. The deck is so shiny that it can reflect people's images. Even the third-class cabins are in good order and not messy at all, which is very different from the stinking and crowded boats of other companies. The first-class cabins are especially comfortable, with libraries, smoking rooms, and music rooms. The meals are divided into Western and Japanese cuisine, both of which are delicious. In the evening, movies are shown in the dining hall, making it a joyful experience. One does not know that they are in the Yellow Sea. It is said that the China-Japan route of the Japan Mail Steamship Company has a large annual loss, which is supplemented by the profits of the Europe-America route. The Japanese government is attentive to maintaining transportation. Looking back at our country, we are far behind.</p>
<h3>Random Talks on Cholera Prevention Injections</h3>
<p>— Ma Yinliang</p>
<p>Recently, many friends and acquaintances have come to my clinic to receive cholera prevention injections and have often asked about the medical principles involved. I have recorded them and will publish them for the public to understand that prevention injections are not dangerous and are the only good way to avoid cholera.</p>
<p>㈠ The best time for injections is between May and June each year. Cholera usually spreads from July to September. The validity period of the injection is about four to five months. Therefore, after receiving the vaccination, one can ensure that they will not be infected with cholera.</p>
<p>㈡ Slight fever after injection has no effect on physical health. If you are vaccinated at 3 or 4 PM, the fever will occur at bedtime at night. You can work as usual the next day. It has no effect.</p>
<p>㈢ Two preventative injections must be administered. The time interval should be one week. If only one injection is given, the resistance generated is insufficient and cannot achieve the desired effect.</p>
<p>㈣ Vaccines used for injections have been imported in the past. In recent years, some Chinese have also made their own. However, most still use foreign goods. In fact, vaccines are valued for their freshness. Foreign goods are transported to China and are not as fresh as domestic goods. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Health Laboratory has also made products using local patient strains, which are more effective. Now, the general manager of Wuzhou Pharmacy, Yu Le, uses it. I hope that Chinese people will not despise it because it is not a foreign product.</p>
<p>Correction: In the small soaring note published on the 6th, there was a section on the China Aviation Company being licensed to photograph Shanghai scenery. It was found to be a mistake by the Fei Yun Company at 3 Guangdong Road. This is a correction.</p>
<h3>Heartfelt Warmth (II)(II)(9)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 12: Parting Banquet, Farewell Feast, Picking Flowers to Leave a Beautiful Impression; Gathering in a Famous Garden, Tea Tasting to Admire the Fragrant Beauty. Later, many initiators and organizers… were persuaded by this gentleman… and indeed used the words "Wan Guo" (All Nations), calling it the "Wan Guo Yuan You Hui" (All Nations Garden Party). Although the surplus income was intended for charity and relief, it was not explicitly stated as such, leaving some room for flexibility in how it would be distributed in the future. Moreover, the location was originally Zhang's Wei Chun Garden. Using the term "Garden Party" made it even more suitable. At that time, it was late summer and early autumn, and Shanghai was buzzing with the "Night Flower Garden" issue. What exactly was a "Night Flower Garden"? It was a place in the suburbs of Shanghai, about ten or twenty miles from the city, where a temporary reed mat shed was erected, dozens of tables and hundreds of chairs were brought in, and a team of chefs specializing in elaborate dishes and cold food were hired, along with a group of unemployed waiters. Where the electricity company's power reached, a string of colorful electric lights was installed at the entrance to attract customers. On a larger scale, advertisements were even placed in newspapers, boasting of special and ingenious Dongguan fireworks. Some even hired a troupe of local opera singers, erecting a stage with the sounds of flutes and drums, silk and bamboo instruments playing together. In reality, the so-called "Night Flower Garden" was neither worthy of being called a "flower" nor a "garden." It was a desolate wilderness where reed mat sheds were temporarily erected, possibly next to desolate tombs or temporary burial grounds. The ground was uneven and full of bumps. If it rained, puddles would accumulate everywhere, turning the whole place into a muddy world. However, Shanghai's group of dissipated young men and enchanting women flocked to it like ducks. Often, around midnight, many carriages would be seen heading towards the Night Flower Gardens in single file. At that time, cars were not yet popular in Shanghai, and horse-drawn carriages were the authority. These Night Flower Garden frequenters and the coachmen had a kind of unspoken arrangement. In short, it meant that his carriages would transport those infatuated men and resentful women who loved nighttime activities to their Night Flower Garden. To enter his Night Flower Garden, one also had to buy a ticket. Fortunately, every coachman always had a stack of tickets on hand, making entry very convenient. Although this was a speculative venture unique to the summer, it deeply resonated with the psychology of the general public in Shanghai. Imagine, being scorched by the scorching sun all day, relying solely on the cool night breeze for some relief, hiring a carriage to take a drive in the suburbs, preferably with a man and a woman sitting side by side, whispering sweet nothings, letting the horses' hooves clatter as they gallop into the canopy of green shade and the carpet of fragrant grass. They also liked to drive fast carriages. In the bustling city, there were many patrolmen. If you drove a fast carriage, you would be taken to the police station. Once they reached the suburbs, with a flick of the reins, the horse would fly off in a cloud of dust. Because there were no policemen in the suburbs. In Shanghai before the advent of cars, these fast carriages were a big hit. However, these Night Flower Gardens were opened every year and opposed every year. Even newspaper reporters would write articles saying that they were harmful to hygiene and detrimental to public morals. As a result, the authorities would issue a ban. By the time the authorities issued a ban, it was already autumn and the weather was cool. Even without the ban, they would have closed down anyway.</p>

<h3>Finance: The Gold Market Changes in an Instant</h3>
<p>▲ The Market is Extremely Chaotic, with an Underlying Weakness. Yesterday, the gold market on the 8th was extremely chaotic, changing in an instant, with fluctuations of six or seven taels at a time, which was incomprehensible. There was a total difference of ten taels throughout the day, but the trend was downward, and the banknote market also appeared weak. Banks were absorbing some, but the psychology of the dealers was very different, so the delivery of notes varied. Zhifeng, Yongtai, Kangrun, Yuanmao, Yongmao, etc., were mostly buying, while Fuchang, Shengda, Yuda, etc., were all selling. As soon as the large early market notes rose sharply, they immediately plummeted. Later, sellers prevailed, and it was said that the 600 tael mark had been broken, suddenly dropping to 594 taels. Afterwards, major players bought vigorously, and confidence easily stabilized, jumping up ten taels, surpassing the 600 tael mark again. Later, Hengxing, Yuansheng, etc., were all selling short positions, while Wanxing, Zhifeng, Yongyuanxing, Yong, and retail investors were buying in. The price was extremely chaotic, fluctuating around 600 taels, and the volatility was very dangerous. The atmosphere was extremely alarming. In short, it was dominated by the atmosphere. Finally, it closed above 602 taels, and exchange rates also slightly stabilized. Yesterday, large notes increased by 5/16, forward contracts increased by 1/4, and the silver price increased by 3/8.</p>
<p>▲ The Early Market Fluctuated and Remained Weak, Closing Higher. The opening price for August gold was 600 taels and 8 qian, a sharp drop of six taels. The gross price rose from 600 taels and 2 qian to 604 taels, at which point someone bought in, and the exchange rate was flat. In September, British banks absorbed 6 pence 25 to 875. When the prime rate was announced, it remained unchanged, but the gold price softened to 603 taels, at which point Heng and Fuchang, etc., sold off. Since British gold seemed loose, Mitsui bought September at 6 pence 25, and China Bank bought 375. Moreover, there was eager selling of short positions in the market. As a result, it plummeted, and the market was quite poor, falling a huge ten taels. At 10:00, it finally reached 594 taels. Afterwards, the wind suddenly shifted, and Zhejiang absorbed September British gold at 6 pence 3125. Yuanxing, Yongtai, Kangrun, etc., all rushed to buy in, and speculators also took the opportunity to enter, exceeding the 600 tael mark again, surging up ten taels. At 11:30, it was 604 taels, but there were ups and downs of two or three taels from time to time, and it suddenly dropped more than three taels to 600 taels and 5 qian. The market closed at noon at 603 taels.</p>
<p>▲ The Evening Market Was Unpredictable, with the Outcome Trending Downward. The afternoon market opened at 603 taels and 6 qian. Afterwards, due to the increase in Indian exchange rates, it fell to one tael, and retail investors, etc., bought in. Since Indian exchange rates were said to be contracting, it rose again by more than three taels to 604 and a half taels. Later, Guang Gang's Hengxing and Fuchang Yuancheng, etc., all sold off, and banks were doing this month's prime rate against 6 pence 0625 in August 125, so it immediately fell 14 taels. After 3:00, the 600 tael mark had been broken. The atmosphere was even worse, and at 3:30 it fell to 96 taels and 5 qian. At that moment, buying interest was strong, and Taiwan absorbed August British gold at 6 pence 1875. Confidence immediately strengthened, and like wind and clouds rising, it soared upwards, rising six or seven taels. But suddenly there was a huge change, which was difficult to grasp, and the various firms were still drifting with the wind, with no clear direction. At 4:30, it closed at 603 taels and 5 qian, down 3 taels and 3 qian compared to the 7th.</p>
<p>▲ The Suppressed Amount of the Clearing Price Was About 60 Taels. The maximum price for the whole day was 604 taels and 5 qian, and the minimum price was 594 taels, a fluctuation of 10 taels and 5 qian. The clearing price in the morning was 663 taels, a suppression of 60 taels to 68.9 taels. At noon, it was 60 taels, and in the afternoon, it was still suppressed by 60 taels. The account books showed 601 taels for July and 03 taels for August, with a supplement of 01 taels in the morning and 02 taels in the afternoon. The spot price opened at 600 taels and 05 qian in the morning, closed at 604 taels at noon, and 3 taels and 3 qian in the afternoon, closing at 2 taels and a half.</p>
<p>▲ The Purpose of Speculation Was Uncertain, and Receipts and Disbursements Were Erratic. In terms of transactions, Yuanmao Yong, Zhifeng Yong, Huatai, Taikangrun, Yuankangxiang, Yuanxingyong, Yongchenchang, Dadecheng, Wanxing, etc., were all buying. Fuchang, Hengxing Yuancheng Yong, Yuda, Fuyu had erratic receipts and disbursements, but the number was quite considerable. Yongfeng, Xiangyu, Yuanyu Yong, Chunyuanyong, Shunmao, and retail investors, etc., were all selling. In the afternoon, Yuda, Shengda, Hengxing, Fuchang Yuancheng, etc., all sold off. Wanxing, Yuanxingyong, Yuankangxiang, Yiyu, Zhifeng Yong all bought in. Dalian Gang bought 1400-1500 notes and sold 800-900 notes. Guang Gang bought a small number and sold over 1000 notes. Those who were hedging bought in and then sold the exchange rate.</p>
<h3>The Silver Market Is About to Experience the Dullness of Midsummer</h3>
<p>▲ Market Overview. The financial market this summer is different from previous years, as detailed in previous reports. However, yesterday's situation, a kind of slack and indifferent state, was similar again. Recently, in terms of silver demand, passenger routes and sales have stagnated. The demand in this street for summer vacations is mostly unnecessary, relying only on exchange transactions among dealers, which feels very unproductive. As for the situation of loose silver, it is even less of a problem. From now on, the silver market will enter the path of midsummer laziness.</p>
<p>▲ Split Price. [Silver Interest] Although the trading situation in the morning and afternoon markets yesterday was still not weak, the competition for interest rates seemed to have declined. As a result, the price in both markets was the same, 7 qian 2 fen 5 li 2 hao and a half, a slight decrease of 2 hao and a half compared to the previous day, and a weakness is about to appear, fearing a slight decline day by day. [Silver Split] 7 fen in the morning market and 4 fen in the afternoon market, a further drop of several fen compared to the previous day. The market situation was quiet, and the demand route was sparse. There were no listings among banks, so there was no addition of water to the allocation.</p>
<p>▲ Subsidiary Coin Situation. Jiangnan small coins were slightly profitable yesterday, with 6 qian 2 fen 4 li and a half in the morning market and 6 qian 2 fen 5 li and a half in the afternoon market, a difference of 1 li between the two markets, with transactions of 2,000 jiao each in the morning and afternoon markets. Guangdong small coins were blocked for sales, and the market price fell, with 6 qian 04 li 7 hao and a half in the morning market and 6 qian 03 li in the afternoon market, a drop of 2 li and a half compared to the morning market of the previous day. Transactions were 95,000 jiao in the morning market and 15,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins suddenly contracted by 3,000 wen to 387,000, also the lowest price since last month.</p>
<p>▲ Silver Inflow and Outflow. [Silver Funds] Yesterday, bank receipts and remittances were sparse due to the slack in commerce in various aspects. Chinese merchants received and remitted 1.7-1.8 million, foreign merchants received and remitted over 1.4 million, various goods, exchange taxes, miscellaneous funds received and remitted 8.6-8.7 million. There were no other special receipts and remittances. 1.5 million was withdrawn from the warehouse. Japanese banks received and remitted various funds of over 3.4 million, and 500,000 was withdrawn from the warehouse. Money houses and silver public units received and remitted over 35 million, allocated funds received and remitted over 3.4-3.5 million, and various remittances of over 900,000. Over 2 million was received in cash, all half deposited in the warehouse. [Silver Coins] The morning market made 1.3 million in remittance and allocation, and the afternoon market made 973,000. 10,000 in banknotes in the morning market and 40,000 in the afternoon market. 115,000 in off-market banknotes in the morning market and 95,000 in the afternoon market. Banks bought and sold 480,000 in the morning market and 400,000 in the afternoon market. Receipts and remittances between foreign banks' silver accounts were over 1.5 million, and silver allocation receipts and remittances were over 1.9 million. Banknote inflow and outflow were over 1.3-1.4 million, and loans of silver coins were over 1.2 million. Money houses and silver public units received and remitted over 4.1 million, and small money house transactions were over 600,000. As for the passenger route, the source has disappeared, and besides a small amount of new coins installed by the Guang Gang, there is nothing else to report.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Continues to Loosen</h3>
<p>▲ Only Japanese Gold Increased by 25. Yesterday, HSBC listed its prices, and foreign exchange remained unchanged. Although the big notes increased, they were unmoved. Only the internal prices of the bank fluctuated slightly, starting loose and then becoming more tired. The afternoon market turned flat and stable. The price of gold fluctuated greatly, with a twist of more than ten taels. Until the close of the market, compared to the previous day (7th), British gold increased slightly by .0625, US gold increased by .125, and Japanese gold increased by 25. However, there were no corresponding transactions, and the situation was extremely dull. Chinese speculators sold more than 200,000 pounds of British gold, which was absorbed by Taiwan, Shanghai, Sumitomo, Xingye, Mitsui, Anda, Zhejiang, Zhongxing, etc. Buying appetite was still good, so there were no special changes. Some gold businesses hedged notes. Various banks also did tens of thousands of pounds among themselves, and 100,000 yuan of US gold. Chinese merchants rarely made any withdrawals. Japanese gold was also dull, mainly because the hedging was very poor, and the market sentiment was uncertain. The market atmosphere was still hovering in a stalemate.</p>
<h3>The Price of Silver Recovers, and the Exchange Rate Loosens</h3>
<p>According to the London telegraph yesterday, the price of silver recovered, with the near-term increasing by 3.125 to 15 pence 875 (equivalent to 1 shilling 6 pence 75), and the forward price also increasing by 25 to 15 pence 75. India bought on-site, buyers were content, and the market was flat. The New York telegraph also reported that the price of US silver increased by 375 to 3 jiao and 4 fen. Japanese US dollars remained at 49 yuan 4375. Both the British-US and US-British rates increased by 125 to 4 dollars 8 jiao 6 fen 5625. The British-Japanese rate decreased by 03125 to 2 shillings 040625. The British-Shanghai shilling increased by 125 to 1 shilling 6 pence and a half. India increased by 7 ounces of leverage, compared to 01 ounces of leverage, to 46 lakhs for spot goods. Also, at 9:30 am today, the telegraphic communication agency arrived and reported that there was no increase or decrease. There was also no change at noon. The 2:35 pm telegram reported that the price difference between the British-Japanese near and far futures had decreased by 03125.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bond Prices Plummet All Together</h3>
<p>▲ The Largest Continuous Sweep of Customs Duties... Transactions of 13 Million. Yesterday, in the securities market, the market for various public bonds continued to trend downwards due to public unease and a surge in selling pressure. The decline was especially severe. In the initial opening of the morning, it was under pressure from sellers and fell sharply across the board. The second round of decline was even stronger, and the futures of customs duties almost fell to the stop-loss point. Although the initial round of the afternoon briefly recovered, the final round of closing was still weaker, and the downward trend seemed not to have weakened. As a result, compared to the previous day, the futures continued to be swept down, falling by as much as two yuan and several jiao. The current month futures fell by 1 yuan and 8 jiao, customs duties fell by about 1 yuan and a half, and compilation, estate, disarmament, reorganization, six benevolent fell by about 1 yuan each. The amount of the decline was very large. The market transaction situation was about 7.1 million yuan in the morning and about 5.9 million yuan in the afternoon, totaling over 13 million yuan. Among them, customs duties were over 3.5 million yuan, compilation and estate were 1.38 million yuan, disarmament was 2.7 million yuan, and reorganization after was 2.05 million yuan. Besides, the reorganization for six transactions was over 600,000 yuan, and the rest was still scattered. The spot transaction only opened 7,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Standard Yarn Recovers in the Evening Market</h3>
<p>▲ The Guangdong Group's Interest in Purchasing Spot Goods Is Still Strong. The yarn market rose in the morning and fell at noon. The Guangdong Group's interest in purchasing spot yarn is still strong. They raised prices in the market to absorb inventory, and most retail investors had a bullish outlook. The period is approaching the autumn sales season, and the market soared in the three months of July, August, and September last year. Therefore, there are more people trading long this year. However, large investors still adopt a sell-on-rise strategy. The overseas cotton yarn market is uniformly trending downwards, so some people still have a bearish outlook. However, current actual sales are only strong in Guangdong, and other groups are still inactive. If it affects the development of other groups, the market will naturally have the potential to look higher.</p>
<p>▲ Standard Pricing Rose in the Morning and Fell at Noon. The standard pricing market opened low in the morning due to the decline in US cotton. The public was neutral. All months fell by 2, 3, 4, or 5 qian. In the afternoon, it was suddenly heard that private estimates of cotton fields had decreased by more than one million mu. Public sentiment suddenly rose, and the trading platform became dry. All months rose by 6, 7, or 8 to 1 tael and 1 qian. However, Gongtai and some others sold off on the rise. The total transaction volume for the day was 16,300 bales. The closing prices for standard pricing are recorded on the left.</p>

<h3>The Cotton Market Is Still Difficult to Improve</h3>
<p>▲ US Cotton Continues to Weaken... Factory Demand Is Quiet... Japanese Merchants Sell Off. The cotton market initially fell and then rose, but the US cotton situation is still declining, so public sentiment has softened. Spot cotton factories have no intention to purchase, and demand is quiet. In the afternoon, it was suddenly heard that private estimates of cotton fields had decreased. Public sentiment was excited, but Japanese merchants took the opportunity to sell off on the rise, and the volume was very large.</p>
<p>▲ Near-Term Standard Chinese Cotton Is Relatively Firm. The Standard Chinese Cotton Exchange opened low in the morning due to the poor situation of US cotton. Pessimism was relatively strong, and all months fell by 1 qian 5 fen to 3 qian and a half. In the afternoon, due to the decrease in cotton fields, retail investors covered short positions and traded long, recovering by 3 qian. However, Gongtai sold 3,100 dan alone. The total transaction volume for the day was 33,400 dan. The closing prices for Standard Chinese Cotton are recorded on the left.</p>

<h3>US Cotton and Three Commodities Are Dull and Lifeless</h3>
<p>▲ Indian Cotton Exporters Are Buying Strongly... British Cotton Is Also Firm.</p>

<p>July 7th, New York Telegram. The Gerber Company's estimate of cotton fields this year is 45,991,000 mu, a decrease of 234,000 mu compared to the previous estimate (June 9th). The Memphis Commercial Appeal's estimate of cotton fields this year is 45,703,000 mu. Also, the Cotton Receiving Office's estimate of cotton fields this year is 46,605,000 mu. The cotton receiving situation is 73.6% of the normal annual output.</p>
<h3>The Reasons for the Decline in Domestic Cotton Production This Year</h3>
<p>▲ Soaring Rice Prices... Military Disasters and Banditry... Difficulty in Working.</p>
<p>▲ Northern Xihe... Slightly Increased by 20%... Good Development.</p>
<p>▲ Shanxi Also Increased... Timely Planting... Excellent Cotton Seedlings.</p>
<p>This year, domestic new cotton fields have decreased due to soaring rice prices, coupled with military disasters and banditry. The situation in various places is briefly recorded as follows.</p>
<p>A. Shanghai Area</p>
<p>1.  Tongzhou Cotton: In the southern areas such as Jinsha and Changle, cotton fields account for about 75% of the total area, similar to last year. There are more early flowers. Currently, the first weeding is underway. In the middle areas such as Matang and Juegang, it has decreased by about 15%. Development is later than the southern areas. In the western areas such as 30 Li Baipu, it has decreased by about 20%. The development situation is similar to the middle areas. In the northern areas such as Fengli, it has decreased by 20%, and development is even later. In the eastern areas such as Qilin Town, it has decreased by about 20%, and development is slightly later than the southern areas.</p>
<p>2.  Nanshi and Beishi Cotton: It has also decreased by 10-20% compared to last year, and development is quite good.</p>
<p>B. Hankou Area: In the Laohekou and Pinghan Road areas, it has decreased by 10% across the board. In the Xiangxiang Road area, it has decreased by about 15%. The yarn market is similar to last year. The planting season was about half a month later than in previous years due to continuous rain. The germination state was quite good due to suitable humidity. However, farmers are troubled by banditry, and weeding work is not done carefully, causing weeds to grow and affect the harvest.</p>
<p>C. Zhengzhou Area: Due to the attacks by soldiers and bandits, the situation is not yet clear. It is certain that cotton fields have decreased.</p>
<p>D. Tianjin Area:</p>
<p>1.  Xihe Area: Cotton fields have slightly increased. American cotton has increased by 20% compared to last year. The cotton seedlings are developing well.</p>
<p>2.  Yuhe Area: Cotton fields have decreased slightly, and development is still good.</p>
<p>3.  Shanxi: In the past two years, it suffered a major drought. This year, it coincided with timely rainfall during planting. Cotton fields have increased, and the cotton seedlings are developing very well.</p>
<h3>Grain: The Rice Market Is Quiet Due to Scarcity of Goods</h3>
<p>▲ Zhabei: Yesterday, one rice boat was seen arriving at the riverbank. The registration and storage of japonica rice has been completed, so there is no market situation for white japonica rice here. Thin rice is also in short supply. Yang Xian rice is available in the market, but the quantity is less than 100 shi. The price is weak due to the softening of foreign rice. Currently, the sharp-edged goods in various factory warehouses are almost gone, and most are selling Saigon small-sized rice. The total storage in Bianyuan River is about 700-800 shi. Market sales are not strong, and the price is neither prosperous nor degraded. The ordinary price is still opening around 19 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai South Inner Road: Tongli Japonica No. 1 and White Yuan Numbers have arrived. Various rice shops are not greedy for purchasing. Only the ordinary machine-milled japonica standard of 21 yuan is emptied as soon as it arrives. Duzi Xian, etc., have not arrived for several days. The market situation is very quiet. White Yuan's sales are refreshing, and this street is also selecting high-quality goods to purchase. The market price is still flat due to the continued arrival of sources, opening at the 19 yuan mark. Wholesale customer goods are separated by 3-4 jiao.</p>
<h3>Standard Flour Closes with Factories Showing Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market opened in the morning, but due to changes in the gold market and a decrease in foreign wheat, some longs were eager to get out, with July and August falling to about 2 li, 5 qian, and 3 fen, down 1-2 fen from the closing price of the previous day. Then, public sentiment followed suit, covering short positions and turning good, and the market price also improved by several fen. In the afternoon, factories secretly sold in front, and customer groups followed suit, and the market situation plummeted. Public sentiment in the market was also shaken and uncertain. This is because the shipments of flour and grain from Tianjin and Yingkou have already been banned by the customs. Yesterday, there were even rumors that Qingdao and other ports would also be banned. If so, the northern sales route will be completely cut off. However, if the move to cut off the transport of northern wheat, soybeans, and various coarse grains becomes a reality, it will outweigh the benefits. There may be unexpected changes in the market. Moreover, the market prices of foreign flour and wheat have repeatedly fallen, and the reason why large quantities cannot be shipped to China is the obstruction of gold prices. If the gold market is slightly lower, the large-scale import of foreign wheat and flour into North China will inevitably become a reality. Once the suspension of transport between the north and south ends, and the market is full of foreign grain, the market's shaking will be expected. The sudden rise and fall of the flour market yesterday, the rise and then the fall, is because public sentiment is worried about the above concerns. The market closed with factories showing weakness, with this month down 1 fen and 25, August, October, and November each down half a fen, September down 1 fen, and November down 1 fen and 25.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Fall Three to Four Points</h3>
<p>After the wheat market opened yesterday, prices for all months uniformly declined. During the second trading session, prices rebounded slightly before continuing their downward trend in the afternoon. Market fluctuations ranged from three to five points. This was primarily due to news circulating about disruptions in various supply sources, which had already impacted market sentiment. Grain merchants seized the opportunity presented by the earlier price increase to aggressively seek out supplies, either expediting shipments to the port or pre-ordering cargo from foreign ships. A large shipment of Yangtze River wheat had already arrived yesterday, and another substantial shipment was expected to arrive on a pre-determined date. In addition to selling spot goods, merchants also dumped futures contracts, causing the market to open weakly. Short covering initially improved the situation, but subsequent heavy selling caused the market to decline again, with July contracts closing down three points and contracts from August to December each down four points. The arrival of spot wheat yesterday was still substantial, and there was pre-emptive selling of wheat en route, prompting mills to reconsider their plans and adopt a wait-and-see approach, refraining from accepting deliveries. This immediately weakened the market. Total sales were less than 5,000 bags. Prices declined by a few points, with 150 bags of Mingguang wheat selling for 4 taels, 8 qian, and 2 fen; 200 bags of wheat selling for 4 taels and 9 qian; 3,000 bags of wheat from Shashi, Hankou, etc., selling for 4 taels, 8 qian, and 5 fen to 4 taels and 8 qian; and individual cartloads of wheat from Yao, Xuzhou, Yizheng, etc., selling for 4 taels, 8 qian, and 5 fen to 4 taels and 7 qian, reportedly purchased by Yuhuo Xin and others.</p>
<h3>Standard Soybean Cake Reaches Unprecedented High Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the standard futures soybean cake market performed exceptionally well. This was due to high Dalian production costs, robust local spot sales, rising raw material soybean prices, and increased costs. Oil mills adopted a wait-and-see approach before selling. Additionally, inland buyers from Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, and other regions had to aggressively purchase due to sales relationships. As a result, the standard near-term contracts soared by a significant four points, opening at 2 taels and 1 qian for the first half of July and 2 taels and 0.9 qian for the second half of July. Such market conditions were unprecedented. Spot soybean cake, including public association, Shahe, Dalian, and local factory edge cakes and plain cakes, also reached around 2 taels and 1 qian.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: High-Grade Dutch Raw Sugar Opens Briskly</h3>
<p>▲Coarse Sugar White Sugar Market Quiet but Firm Yesterday, sugar market dispatches reported that the spot price of Cuban sugar was high at 1.3125, while the price of New York sugar futures for September was 1.32, a decrease of one point compared to the previous dispatches. The prices for December, March next year, and May were 1.41, 1.49, and 1.57, respectively, each down two points. The spot price of Javanese sugar was 8.75, while the price of sugar futures for August and September was 8.50, each up 0.125 compared to the previous dispatches. At the Public Association market, the posted price for Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sugar white sugar was relatively firm. However, due to the impending closure the next day, buying interest was very limited, resulting in quiet trading. The asking price was 7 taels and 9 qian, but there were few inquiries. Later, a small number of transactions occurred at a price of 7 taels, 8 qian, and 5 fen, and the market trend was still firm. No. 20 medium sugar white sugar was priced at 7 taels, 8 qian, 2 fen, and 5 li, and the market was also quite brisk. Japanese sugar transactions were more active, and the market rose slightly again. Yin Hua YRO mark was priced at 8 taels, 0 qian, 2 fen, and 5 li to 8 taels and 5 fen, YP mark was priced at 8 taels and 3 qian and 5 fen, and YT mark was priced at 8 taels, 1 qian, 5 fen to 8 taels, 1 qian, and 7 fen and 5 li. Later, sellers further increased prices, leading to no transactions. Hua Xinhang offered for sale over 1,000 bags of high-grade Dutch red sugar, priced as high as 6 taels and 8 qian and 5 fen, which was quite brisk due to the actual shortage of high-grade goods in the market.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Fresh Wild Jujube Branches Now Available</h3>
<p>▲Top-Grade Chinese Cinnamon Rises Another Two Taels Yesterday, it was reported that various Cantonese wholesalers in the northern market had started to sell the newly arrived wild jujube branches. Higher-quality goods were priced at 17 taels and 2 qian, while slightly lower quality goods were priced at around 16 taels to 15 taels, with swift sales. Due to insufficient supplies, the new Zhangzhou branches will be available for sale today. Top-grade dried longan, becoming increasingly scarce, felt quite vigorous. Several dozen boxes opened yesterday, rising another two taels compared to the previous market, even exceeding the posted price.</p>
<h3>Arrowroot Flour Soars, Then Stabilizes Slightly</h3>
<p>Due to limited arrivals and robust domestic sales, arrowroot flour prices progressively soared. Although there were continued offers on the market, quantities were generally small. The highest price for Tongshou goods rose to 10 taels and 1 qian. Top-grade goods were generally sold out, and traders were reportedly asking for prices above 11 taels and were sending dispatches to procure more. The market's momentum was unprecedented. Yesterday, only a few hundred packages opened in Wuchang, mainly Tongshou goods from Xiao HeXing, WeiXing, and YiXing. Xiao HeXing and WeiXing opened over a hundred packages yesterday, priced at 10 taels and 6 qian, and the market seemed to have stabilized.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Disastrously Poor Summer Cocoon Harvest in Southern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>▲Entirely Due to Weather Damage… Only Slightly Over 10% Harvested Farmers in Jiangning, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Yixing, Liyang, Jintan, Dantu, and other counties in southern Jiangsu, encouraged by government officials and silk merchants, generally supplemented their production by raising summer silkworms. However, due to unfavorable weather conditions and repeated drastic changes, silkworm moths suffered severe damage, with eight or nine out of ten being lost. Although new cocoons are gradually entering the market, the total cocoon production is only slightly over 10%, and the cocoon quality is poor. Silk cocoon merchants are generally pessimistic, and farmers across the region are lamenting their losses.</p>
<h3>High-Grade Zhuang Zhenmei Tea Sells Briskly, Primarily in Europe</h3>
<p>Yesterday at the foreign trader tea market in this port, Tianxiang Foreign Firm showed continued strong interest in Wuyuan high-grade Zhuang Zhenmei tea. Sales offers for Northern Route goods remained between 140 and 150 taels. Extracted core goods with superior production methods and water quality were priced at 210 taels. Needle eyebrow and Xiu eyebrow teas were also actively traded. However, due to excessive imports of Tunxi County and other lower-grade Zhuang Zhenmei tea to Morocco last year, sales remained stagnant. The stock of these Zhenmei teas in the market has been increasing daily, significantly impacting prices. Tea merchants from various routes are very concerned about this market situation, and most have decided to stop importing. It is expected that this year's tea volume will decrease by about 30% to 40% compared to last year.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Demand from Sichuan Merchants Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>Textile transactions remained active yesterday. Sichuan merchants were aggressively procuring goods, with 400 to 500 pieces being transacted. Yuehua also personally procured goods, revitalizing the market. Medium-grade goods, regardless of brand, were generally priced at 1 qian and 8 fen. Flowered straight tribute flannel also sold briskly, with Yuhuayuan, Tu Yuan, and Tu Dahong priced at 3 qian, 2 fen, and 5 li, with a steady inflow. Fine flannel was still being procured. Haichang blue fine cloth also transacted over 100 pieces, further strengthening confidence. Hunting goose and Muqiu straight tribute flannel sold for 3 qian and 1 fen, Moganshan for 3 qian, and Shuangtonglu for 2 qian and 6 fen, all selling out. Due to the shortage of Western lower-body fabrics, Yu Yu silk also steadily increased in price. Yesterday, Qingguan Jing opened at 9 taels, 3 qian, and 5 fen, and Santanyinyue at 9 taels and 1 qian. Foreign red mark goods were slightly replenished by Hubei merchants, with 6-pound Santan at 3 taels and 9 qian, Guoju at 4 taels and 5 fen, and 4-pound at 3 taels, 3 qian, and 5 fen. Chongsu silk required 4 taels and 5 fen. Prices for all goods were rising steadily. Western-style Rucy Yuanrong continued to rise yesterday, with Taihe Changrenbei at 8 qian, 7 fen, and 5 li, and Gongping Liuhai at 8 qian and 5 fen. Yu Yu silk was quite popular among Yangtze River merchants, with about 30 pieces being transacted yesterday.</p>

<h3>Observations on Road Administration in Sichuan and Hunan</h3>
<p>— Wu Wei</p>
<p>[Chinese transportation has always been notoriously blocked. Fortunately, in recent years, road construction has made considerable achievements. The original rugged paths have now mostly been transformed into broad avenues…Transportation along the eastern coast and the northwestern border can now be gradually connected…] These are the remarks made by Ms. Smith, a U.S. Department of Commerce representative, at a meeting of the Union Pacific Society. According to reports, the Union Pacific Society held a luncheon meeting on the 27th of last month. Many Chinese and foreign dignitaries attended, such as Foreign Minister Dr. Wang Zhengting and U.S. Department of Commerce representative Ms. Smith, who all gave speeches. Ms. Smith recently traveled extensively through Sichuan and Hunan provinces, conducting detailed research and investigations into the road conditions in those two provinces. Therefore, I have translated her speech below for the reference of those interested in road administration.</p>
<p>Current Status of Hunan Roads Hunan covers an area of approximately 83,000 square miles and has a population of approximately 40 million. The area around Dongting Lake and along the Yangtze River is the most densely populated. Transportation with neighboring provinces is mostly by land. Tracing back to the beginning of road construction, it was only ten years ago that the first road was completed, namely the current Changsha-Xiangtan line, which is 30 miles long and 25 feet wide. The road base is very solid, the road surface is also firm, and the road maintenance method is suitable, so it can often maintain its good condition. All bridge construction is excellent, sturdy, and durable. It has been open to traffic for over five years and has been extremely successful. The long-distance bus ride from Changsha to Xiangtan takes only one hour and five minutes.</p>
<p>The Hunan branch of the International Famine Relief Commission previously received a donation of 500,000 U.S. dollars and began constructing a high-quality road between 1922 and 1923, starting from the west of Xiangtan, passing through Xiangyin, Yongfeng, and ending in Baoqing, with a total length of 110 miles. This road has many high and steep stone bridges, and all construction materials are of the highest quality, making it a [model road].</p>
<p>Regarding road administration facilities, there are currently three agencies responsible for different regions, each responsible for all designs and construction. In August of last year, the Hunan Provincial Government approved 1.5 million yuan for road construction expenses and decided that all long-distance bus services operating on provincial roads would be centrally managed by the provincial government. Car fares were set at a reduced rate to facilitate travel, and automobile license fees were increased according to regulations.</p>
<p>In October of last year, the Hunan Provincial Government also transferred all the troops that had been demobilized in the province to road construction and railway repair, in line with the policy of transforming soldiers into workers. To promote the implementation of the plan, a request was submitted to the Central Compilation and Remnant Committee and the Ministry of Railways to immediately begin construction of the Wugang-Suining Road in the southern part of Hunan Province with 400,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Overall, the current completed automobile roads in Hunan Province have a total length of 389 miles, with a uniform width of 24 feet. The road surfaces are all paved with gravel and are in fairly good condition. There are still 853 miles under construction, and it is planned to add another 1,270 miles, which are expected to be completed within four years.</p>
<p>Current Status of Sichuan Roads Sichuan's transportation is inconvenient, and it has long been known as "The Road to Shu is Difficult." Recently, roads have been gradually opened up, and transportation has been gradually improved. When Yang Sen governed Sichuan in 1923, he first began to widen the streets of the provincial capital. The first road to be repaired was East Avenue. At that time, a considerable number of people opposed it, attacking Yang Sen severely, but Yang persisted with determination and eventually succeeded. After the road was widened, commerce flourished sharply, and the market became increasingly prosperous. As a result, merchants and residents with property on other streets all looked on with envy and voluntarily gave up land to widen the roads to compete. Therefore, as a result of competition, the merchants on East Avenue expanded the streets again to maintain their inherent superior position. The changes in mentality before and after were like this. By 1926, most of the streets in Chengdu had been widened, and the expenses were mostly borne by the homeowners. It can be seen that where there is profit, success is easy. The roads from Chengdu to various counties are very complex and most are under construction. The most important is the Chengdu-Chongqing Road, which is 300 miles long and is estimated to require at least 4 million yuan in construction costs. In the future, after completion, it will be an important route from the Yangtze River basin into Sichuan. Long-distance buses will arrive in one day. Construction began in the summer of the year before last. During the work period, there were many obstacles. Although it is still continuing, it is still unpredictable when it will be completed.</p>
<p>In the Hechuan-Ningxi area, the streets have also been widened to 30 feet, with the roadbed filled with gravel and the road surface paved with lime concrete. The new roads run vertically and horizontally, and transportation is extremely convenient.</p>
<p>Jianzhou also has wide and excellent streets, and many houses have been improved and newly built, with a prosperous atmosphere that is evident at a glance.</p>
<p>In total, there are approximately 1,200 miles of completed automobile roads in Sichuan Province, with a common width of between 25 and 30 feet. Currently, most are dirt roads, but it can be asserted that they will gradually be converted into solid stone roads in the future.</p>

<h3>Reducing Travel Time</h3>
<p>Passengers Gain an Extra Day Vice President and Traffic Manager of the Great Northern Railway Company, Mr. Kinnear, recently announced that the company's Empire Builder train has reduced its travel time by another hour. This is the fourth time the Great Northern Railway has shortened train travel times in less than a year. According to this timeline, westbound trains will be reduced by a total of 7 hours and 15 minutes, while eastbound trains will be reduced by 5 hours and 45 minutes. The increased speed will take effect on June 1, starting west of Shelby, arriving in Seattle at 9:00 AM each morning, compared to the usual arrival time of 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>The Great Northern route will also benefit from earlier train arrivals. The Empire Builder train, which runs between Spokane and Portland, will arrive in Portland earlier in the morning. In Spokane, Washington, the evening arrival time will be changed from 10:45 PM to 10:00 PM, as Great Northern Railway's passenger department officials felt that 10:45 PM was too late for passenger convenience. Mr. Kinnear said that the reduced travel time for westbound trains is a success of Great Northern's original plan. A year ago, the travel time was shortened by five hours to avoid passengers having to spend an extra day on the journey. The shorter travel time is due to the adoption of new-style eight-mile smoke funnels with electric locomotives, which have great power and speed, and the use of more direct routes to climb mountains and cross ridges, which also shortens the travel time. Previously, travel from Chicago to Seattle or Portland required 68 hours, with arrivals in Chicago and the Pacific Coast in the evening and departures at night. After Great Northern Railway shortened the journey by five hours, passengers on both eastbound and westbound trains can now arrive at their destinations during the day and no longer have to travel at night. This change was driven by the needs of cities on the Pacific Coast, as passengers arriving in Chicago at 9:15 AM, rather than 10:00 AM, would find it much more convenient, as they would have the whole day to manage their affairs or travel. Mr. Kinnear also said that the most appropriate time for trains to arrive in Seattle and Portland is before 9:00 AM, as it allows passengers to wake up at a convenient time and have breakfast before disembarking. A month ago, the Empire Builder train between Chicago and Minneapolis reduced its travel time by 1 hour and 15 minutes and now departs from Chicago at 10:15 PM instead of 10:00 PM each evening. According to Great Northern Railway's new plan, westbound trains will be reduced to 60 hours and 45 minutes. Mr. Kinnear said that there are no plans to change the time for eastbound trains, which is 61 hours and 15 minutes. Although there is no official announcement about shortening the time between Minneapolis and Shelby, Great Northern Railway placed 14 new locomotives on this section of the railway several weeks ago. According to company officials, these locomotives are the fastest and most powerful ever built. The locomotives have giant 80-inch wheels, similar to the locomotives on eastern express trains, but superior to the eastern routes in that the new locomotives have four pairs of giant wheels, while the former only has three pairs. Over the past few years, Great Northern Railway has spent millions of dollars to improve the slopes and curves of the route, rebuild the tracks, increase automatic signals, and increase the number of powerful locomotives. In January of last year, 25,000,000 gold yuan was spent on improving travel through the Cascade Mountains, using electricity and eight-mile smoke funnels. This smoke funnel is the longest of all railway funnels in the Western Hemisphere. Travel between Chicago, Portland, and other cities has been shortened. Mr. Kinnear said that the company's original plan was to shorten the journey by a day to benefit passengers, and today's reduced travel time has been successful. We are very concerned about passenger convenience and the timely arrival of trains.</p>

<h3>Anhui Province Automobile Injury Handling Plan</h3>
<p>— Wu Fei</p>
<p>The Anhui Highway Administration, in view of the increasing development of highway administration throughout the province and the frequent use of public transportation, and the daily reports of injuries caused by accidents, has specifically formulated eleven articles of automobile injury handling regulations to strictly enforce the penalties and prepare for contingencies, which can be said to be extremely careful about road traffic safety. According to the content of the regulations, all plans for automobile injuries are divided into five categories: (1) negligence of the automobile, (2) negligence of the injured person, (3) intentional act of the injured person, (4) unavoidable accidents, and (5) other matters. These are described below.</p>
<p>There are five types of negligence on the part of the automobile: (1) The automobile drives outside the lane width; (2) The automobile reverses or must pass the vehicle in front, and fails to honk the horn to warn, resulting in an accident; (3) The automobile fails to honk the horn when going downhill or turning a corner, resulting in an accident; (4) The automobile fails to honk the horn when passing through a street or intersection where people are passing, or where there are pedestrians traveling in the same direction as the automobile, as well as in densely populated areas, resulting in an accident; (5) The driver violates driving rules, traffic rules, or driver service rules, resulting in an accident. In all these cases, the driver should be held responsible. Therefore, if a person is injured due to the negligence of the automobile driver, in addition to the criminal responsibility that the driver should bear, which is handled by the court, those with minor injuries will be given medical expenses of 5 yuan or less, those with serious injuries will be given medical expenses of 50 yuan or less, and those who are disabled will be given medical expenses of 50 yuan or less in addition to a condolence fee of 100 yuan. If the injury results in death, a burial fee of 150 yuan will be added, or</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>200 yuan.</p>
<p>▲There are five types of negligence on the part of the injured person: (1) A pedestrian stays within the lane width of the highway and does not avoid the approaching automobile, even after hearing the horn; (2) A driver of another vehicle does not follow the prescribed lane or violates traffic rules, resulting in a collision; (3) A pedestrian is walking near a street, either facing or traveling in the same direction as the automobile, and does not avoid or runs left and right after hearing the horn; (4) A person gets on or off an automobile while it is moving; (5) At a bus stop or other traffic location, a person obstructs the automobile's forward movement and does not quickly avoid it after hearing the horn. In these situations, it is all due to the injured person's own negligence. Therefore, regardless of the severity of the injury or death, the Highway Administration may, depending on the circumstances, provide different levels of medical or burial expenses.</p>
<p>▲There are four types of intentional acts on the part of the injured person: (1) A pedestrian intentionally blocks the automobile in the lane width or does not avoid it after hearing repeated horn warnings; (2) A pedestrian suddenly crosses or intentionally drives across the road when the automobile has already sounded the horn and is about to enter an intersection; (3) A person climbs on an automobile or runs and plays near the sides and front and rear of the automobile, resulting in an accident; (4) Other cases of suicide by automobile. In these situations, it is clear that the injured person acted intentionally. Therefore, regardless of the severity of the injury, the Highway Administration will not provide any medical expenses. Only in cases of death caused by intentional acts may a burial fee be provided as a gesture of condolence.</p>
<p>▲There are two types of unavoidable accidents: (1) Mechanical parts of the automobile break down unexpectedly in the middle of the road, causing the automobile to be in danger, resulting in an accident; (2) Encountering an unpredictable accident, the driver cannot control the automobile, resulting in an accident. If an injury or death is caused by an unavoidable accident, the automobile driver's negligence regulations will be followed.</p>
<p>▲Other Matters: Such as pedestrians or residents along the highway herding livestock or scattering objects within the highway route, resulting in an accident. In addition to the injury portion, the Highway Administration may temporarily investigate the situation and handle it within the scope of the regulations. However, no compensation will be given for damage to livestock or objects, and the negligence of obstructing traffic may be investigated. If the automobile is damaged or injures others as a result, the owner of the livestock or objects shall bear all responsibility for the damage and injuries. From this, it can be seen that automobile accidents are unavoidable. However, if it is not the driver's negligence, it is the pedestrian's negligence or intentional act. The driver's negligence, of course, should be held criminally responsible. As for travelers, they must avoid approaching automobiles and pay attention to the sound of the horn. If injury or death results from this, it is either negligence or an intentional act. Some people do not know how to be careful and regret it when disaster strikes one day, which is a pity. As for drivers, they must not drive recklessly or cause accidents during driving, and should not overtake the vehicle in front to cause injury.</p>

<h3>Adventures of a Nash Car Trip to Africa</h3>
<p>— Jiren</p>
<p>The earliest situation of automobile travel in America can be inferred from a telegram from General William Grahame Thon to the Nash Motor Company. Mr. William is a famous African explorer and sportsman. He purchased a new Nash Double Ignition six-cylinder sedan and traveled around West Africa. The terrain is mostly mountainous and desolate without roads. It is estimated to have traveled 11,000 miles, which is no different from the initial automobile travel in America.</p>
<p>This long-distance automobile trip in West Africa by Mr. William was initiated by the manager of the Nash Automobile Company in the Gold Coast. The purpose was to test the mechanical capabilities of Nash. General William was specially invited to undertake this task. Starting from Great Bae Mountain to places like Akim and Tougan, the entire journey was long and the road was dangerous, passing through forests, deserts, floating sands, and rapid currents. In the history of automobile travel, food was the most difficult. However, the journey went smoothly without any obstacles.</p>
<p>One day in a certain forest, beside a small path, a large spotted leopard leaped out. A gorilla crouched, its posture fierce, blocking the way. But Mr. William was not afraid, nor did he panic. He opened the engine to full power, accelerated, and charged straight ahead, killing the leopard on the spot, thus avoiding danger. And the Nash car engine suffered no damage. The strength of its engine can be seen from this.</p>
<p>According to Mr. William's report, the sales of automobiles in the Gold Coast are very extensive and increasing every year. Although prices have fallen this year, the price of automobiles has not been affected in any way.</p>
<h3>Passing of Two Great Pillars of the American Automotive Industry</h3>
<p>— Tan Zidian</p>
<p>(1) Mr. C.F. Wilkins. Mr. Wilkins was very poor in his early years, but he was able to be diligent and thrifty, accumulate capital for his studies, and spare no effort in researching the automotive industry. He was finally able to rise repeatedly to the position of General Manager of the Carlisle Tire Company, which was no easy feat. He suddenly passed away in his hometown of Albanany on the 29th of last month at the age of 58. After dropping out of school in 1898, he joined the most reputable Ford Motor Company for an internship. His experience increased day by day. In 1910, he joined the Carlisle Tire Company as a salesman. He was quick in his work and had extensive experience, which deeply gained the trust of the owner of the company. He was promoted repeatedly and eventually became the General Manager, with remarkable achievements in management and planning. In his later years, he devoted more effort to the company's development. Now that he has passed away, everyone in the company is mourning. It is heard that the company is planning to hold a memorial service.</p>
<p>(2) Mr. P. Lelie, a member of the American Amateur Automobile Racing Association, suddenly passed away at his private residence on the 21st of last month. According to reports, Mr. Le was 52 years old and extremely obese. He fell ill very quickly, and some say it was a stroke. Mr. Le grew up in New York and had a good understanding of mechanical engineering since he was a child. From 1903, he worked as an engineer at General Motors, and he especially studied diligently in the field of automobiles. In 1907, he was promoted to Chief Engineer of a branch factory. In 1918, Mr. Le joined the Greenish Automobile Hill Climb Competition and won the championship, and his name became well-known. Everyone in the American automotive industry knew of the person P. Lelie. In 1910, he participated in the second automobile hill climb competition. Unfortunately, he crashed into a large tree midway, and the car overturned. Mr. Le was injured and hospitalized. After half a year, he recovered and was discharged from the hospital. His body became increasingly obese, and he resigned from his position as Chief Engineer of General Motors that year, rarely going out unless it was for an amateur automobile racing event. Now, he has suddenly passed away, leaving behind one son and one daughter.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Records</p>
<h3>The Stability of the Reo Truck</h3>
<p>▲ Extremely Suitable for Transporting Fruits. Mr. Fied R. Leuschen, the owner of an orange orchard in the mountains of Southern California, one day tested the Reo truck and found that it drove smoothly and was extremely suitable for transporting fruits. He then used his original two brands of automobiles for other purposes and purchased a large batch of Reo trucks to replace them. According to him, within the first three months, the profit from these trucks was enough to offset their cost and then some. Each truck travels from one mile to sixty miles around each day, specializing in traveling between the orchard's packing facility and the wharf. Going up and down mountains and valleys, countless times a day. However, the oranges have never rotted due to vibrations. This is commendable.</p>
