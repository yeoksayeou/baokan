<p>— 海客</p>
<p>保險掮客甲人壽保險中要算是我們的公司信用最好了前天有一位保戶病死在死後一點鐘中我就將賠欵如數送去</p>
<p>保險掮客乙這不算甚麼我們的公司比你們更勝一籌昨天有一位保戶從四層樓窗中跌落下來恰好經過我的窗口我忙將賠欵的支票交給了他</p>
<p>算學敎師孩子你知道五加一是多少</p>

<h3>游泳須知</h3>
<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>游泳一事在今日之中國尙屬幼稚數年前上海租界內之游泳池乃專爲外國人而設各大學中亦僅有敎會設立者尙自備游泳池外他無聞也今年入夏以來上海人士之對於游泳似已有熱烈之傾向一般好出風頭之輩更藉此以一獻身手於是向無中國士女涉足其間之公共游泳池乃日日擠得水洩不通吾國人之於運動日見其熱心亦可慶矣爰爲縷述關於游泳之常識如下以爲愛好游泳者作一參考</p>
<p>游泳之適宜時間　游泳爲各種運動中之最佳者因練習游泳全部之身體均須活動能使身體平均發達故也且也游翔水中於心臓無劇烈之應響於皮膚又得澈底淸潔之功露天游泳更得日光空氣之照耀全身其得益殊匪小也然游泳而不得時害多於益游泳者不可不知之也按游泳時間最好在上午或午飯後二小時之後飯後游泳有碍消化大不宜也又在黎明之時劇烈之游泳極有益身體然而日光未現得益不多殊不及午後之相宜也</p>
<p>游泳之適宜地點　鹽水之中人體易浮故初習游泳者除有特備之良好游泳池外最好先在海邊試練然後由淺入深則不論其水質如何均能游泳自如矣又初學游泳者全賴膽大心細且須有一種自信之心入水之後不宜畏怯習久成慣入水乃不覺有異矣海邊游泳最怕風浪驟至不及早避游泳者遇此等事故切勿心慌急須將面上向伸張四肢浮於水面向岸而退</p>
<p>游泳之危險預防　游泳之時偶遇抽筋最爲危險游泳者倘遇此等事故須急行出水加以劇烈之按摩抽筋即已否則可使全身不遂而遭沒頂之險也又在游泳之時至少宜有同伴一人以防不測切勿自誇神技隻身前往又游泳時宜身着適宜之游泳衣普通之單衣必不可用因入水之後動作不能自如也又遇不幸而見小船來救時切不可從船沿爬入宜從其船尾緩緩入船否則船身一邊愛壓小舟亦將沉沒也</p>

<h3>吸烟笑話</h3>

<h3>鄉游瑣記</h3>
<p>— 繩繩</p>
<p>中國幅員廣大語言風俗不逾百里已有差別近於硤石斜橋王店一帶爲世好張君祝壽又爲同宗碩甫兄家建築新居前往參觀耳目所及頗有可記者分誌之如左</p>
<p>俗重蠶桑　浙西一帶蠶事綦重碩甫以子孫衆多又厭蜃市囂塵將於芒種節前鳩工庀材爲經營之始乃同村父老出而梗議謂蠶汛中動土於蠶有損碩甫徇衆意改小暑大暑間興築繩繩曰此固碩甫睦鄰之盛德而鄉俗敦樸非如上海弄堂中之各自爲政也</p>
<p>上樑禮成　上樑之日余往參觀先期鄉中親友爭以糖元寳相餽元寳長尺許以白糖揉米麵爲之吉時旣屆碩甫之第二公郎偕其夫人華服翩翩各執彩綢之一端一聲爆竹元寳紛紛從上飛來盡入彩綢兜中於是恭喜聲說笑聲匠人說吉利話聲一時並作拈香再拜後以元寳分贈工匠并設盛饌享之賀客亦各飲啖而上樑禮成繩繩曰肯堂肯構甚盛典也而碩甫之第二公郎與夫人英年玉貌盈盈含笑於萬頭攢動中尤爲生色</p>
<p>壽筵繁縟　張君壽誕前二日余已先至其時已見庖廚中猪羊雞魚之屬充牣其中午夜即有客到主人竭力周旋漿灑洒臛肉飲食若流客來必挈全家扶老携幼男女蠢俏躋躋一堂其餽祝敬率以小銀元四角六角爲率八角已絕無而僅有而狂飲大嚼達三晝夜其入座也無推遜之虛文其下箸也如春蠶之食葉其一席已終而更設也前席之客未飽即蟬聯不下座瀕行大包小裹併猪蹄魚膾亦瀝乾其汁盛以碗成紥以帕糕糰水果更無論矣誠奇觀也</p>
<p>適從何來　誕日亭午客來如蜂擁有升堂一拜就席狂啖而主人父子互相揣測不能舉其姓名者并面目亦非似曾相識如此者不一而足繩繩曰鄉人飲酒樸陋無足怪獨爲主人默計肴雖不列海錯而煩費恐視上海尤鉅天下之火惜不能徧歷而周覽請於當局定一適中之準則然亦難言也</p>
<h3>濱口內閣之緊縮政策與日本農業之危機</h3>
<p>— 艾艾自日本寄</p>
<p>日本原亦東亞之農業國全國農地的總面積約六百零六萬町步農民人口約二千五百萬人其每年農產物之收獲約有米六千萬石麥類約二千五百萬石其他副產品尙未計入乃自資本主義侵入日本以來工商業勃興都市日益繁盛而農村則漸趨衰落日本工商業在近十五年間皆有四倍以至六倍的發展然農業狀况殊無進步可言迨至素稱代表農村地主階級利益的政友會下台後與代表城市工商資產階級的民政黨繼續握得政權以來農村的不振益見深刻而廣汎之進展而慘淡的農民生活更加尖銳化</p>
<p>濱口內閣所給予農村之最大打擊爲金解禁問題蓋因平價金解禁由匯兌之高漲致生產品價格之低落每年一成半乃至兩成日本農產品年額約三十三億元上下故農民因金解禁而致收入之減少總計一年中幾及五億元之巨現在日本農民負債總額約五十億元因金解禁影響及於歲收之减少約一成五則其借欵負擔之增加額亦爲一成五其總和共爲七億五千萬元合計前述農產額所招之損失約五億元則濱口內閣之平價金解禁所及於農村之影響第一年已逵十二億五千萬圓之巨至其緊縮政策尤直接予農村以壓抑無異於變相的摧殘如早已通過於第五十六次議會之肥料政策之被削除如農林關係之新規事業各項經費的廢止在在皆表示現政府對於農業忽視之弱點</p>
<p>現在日本農村經濟的衰落更形擴大與深入農民的脫逃者日多在農村方面去年米的實收爲五千九百七十二萬石是歉收之年但市場米價除開始時略漲外以後更急激跌落依日本帝國農會調查米的生產費（不算入工錢）在自耕農須三十三元六十七錢在佃農須三十三元八十四錢然而市塲的價格僅祇二十七元其間有六元損失再加租稅敎育費之微課負擔益爲苛重因是農民以痛苦過甚多顧而之他希圖轉入廠以維持其低度之生活</p>
<p>日本土地之質量數量與氣候如嚴格的言之實不能稱爲自然條件利於農的國家惟過去日本政府採取保護農業之政策及獎勵開墾與强度的耕植之結果故尙能獲有良好成績然而歷史發展的過程天然地理的條件與農村人口的繁殖即現政府予以積極的維護恐亦不能突破農業之危機以際此解决人口與食糧問題的諮要極爲迫切緊張之時而日本農村情形有此逆轉之傾向此不特使日本自身陷於困難之境地於我國亦有重大之影響蓋因其自身供給之不足勢必以隣爲壑日本輿論界所謂日本的人口過䞉問題將成爲太平洋上國際交涉之中心絃外之音當不難想見其野心之一斑矣</p>

<h3>美棉形勢悲觀</h3>
<p>天氣雖旱但無蟲害預料八月消費大减</p>
<p>紐約電告最近棉市狀况云新棉進行大都順利天旱之損失爲由果蠶蟲之絕跡所抵銷出售者雖不多但需要殊乏⽦頭貿易仍滯鈍大衆預料八月份之銷費必大减</p>
<h3>糧食河下米市步昂</h3>
<p>閘北昨日裏路到船稍接本街買氣仍活白粳步步向上高貨雖仍二十一元然大有衝出關外之勢普通中關又好兩三角不等宿次等粳又好角左目前粳情極佳薄稻走銷雖爽然到頭寥寥致不開展東新粳廠方始終不售因此表面價格開十九元半實際則無若何交易新客秈來源轉接惟買方觀望而賣方防出售受跌故亦扳售惟賣戶心意祗售十五元則於願已足緣成本較廉也故今市設或開出不免進關未奇然較前盤須短半元之譜矣白元貨稀銷暢價格飛漲刻下普通已在十九元三四角間如特頂者可在二十元左右</p>
<p>滬南河下到船六七號市銷尙可常帮機粳見緊角許蘇同白粳亦上漲一兩角不等市况隨閘方而轉移惟統市來源凋零故成交無幾南帮薄稻祗有零星略抵市氣堅挺變元走銷甚殷內地到貨時有時無故大盤見昂兩角</p>
<h3>洋米客化甚呆</h3>
<p>下午公會開成立會停市</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况甚呆本街均主觀望統市祇有上午內地帮辦去二號西貢五百包價十四元八角次大絞三百包價十二元四角其他均無成交午後因雜糧同業公會開成立大會停市一天致無交易</p>
<h3>標粉下墜之由來</h3>
<p>浮多出籠金價暴跌</p>
<p>昨日粉市各月份大致呈初平繼疲之象初以洋麥報價回起二三角不等人心鎭靜惟以後各盤因外行心思不佳對於近遠各期均紛紛回出故市面已呈下墜之象迨至下午收盤因金價跌去十兩左右一般做心思者以爲金價一落匯率當然放長將來於拋訂洋麥彷彿又多機會因此賣氣大暢市况步趨下游惟做多之廠家仍見收進不知此後之結局究屬誰見勝利也結果八十正月份較前日各跌一分半九月份跌一分二厘半十一月份跌二分二厘半十二月份跌一分七厘半</p>
<h3>期麥銳跌五六分</h3>
<p>昨日期麥呈初定繼跌之態因初盤時見洋麥報價略好人心尙穩旋以廠家對現麥需要已不甚殷致標準局面爲之帶動迨至下午開盤因粉市已軟兼因標金落去十兩左右多頭深恐匯率一長洋麥訂購可近所以大批回出市面遂盤盤銳落惟此種景象仍係一時之衝動後步當有問題也結果八十正月份較前日跌六分九十一月份跌五分十二月份跌四分現麥因各廠鑒實銷不動標準又跌之後均趨觀望故全市未有做開云</p>

<p>開除工友廠方於此次復工時忽又開除工友三人一時全體工人異常憤慨以爲廠方第一步履行手續即已變更原議故相率請求廠方代表杜月笙君據理交涉茲悉雙方關於此事略有誤會廠方並非拒絕三人之工作乃係廠中職工業已滿額之故一待新工退出即可重行入廠工會方面聞上消息後遂亦別無異議矣</p>
<p>新工問題廠方前次所招之新工人統計共有四百餘名其中白俄工人約計八十名現下大半雖已離職惟廠中尙餘白俄新工三十餘名華人新工亦有不少俱在工作聞公司方面對於此項新工决於日內遣令出外决不因之而發生問題云</p>

<h3>弟弟變爲保護者</h3>
<p>— 光美</p>
<p>純海洋性的上海白晝的火傘是怎樣地高張着人們熱得幾乎透轉不過氣來汗汁好似不值錢的自來水一般隨意滴流一樣感覺熱的狗垂着三寸來長的舌頭張大了嘴巴氣息喘急地好似發了瘋狂也似地跳個不休天剛破曉的一刻紅雲呈現着殺氣似地佈滿了天空不待朝陽的出現鳴蟬已撕破了嗓子拚命地狂叫着庭樹也靜止牠那柔媚的枝葉底擺動怪幽靜地籠罩在柔軟的薄紗般霧柔裏好似那可愛的羔羊躺在他母親的懷抱裏吃奶般地甜靜這在在都是暗示給我們今天天氣是特別熱的但每到傍晚暴君似地太陽由蒼茫隱沒不得不讓位給那偉大仁慈的月亮</p>
<p>偉大仁慈的月兒呀你的温柔慈祥照遍了大地你的偉大母愛普及了一切這時宇宙間的萬物都似掙脫出苦悶的藩籬首先雀躍的要算那最活潑生動的風姨即使那鴿籠式的弄堂裏的人們也總要受到她一點的撫愛吧我呢可更不消說半夜不蓋被總不免要受凉的蓋了較輕的被單如果忘了用較重的東西裝着時便要被吹到地面上去頓時房間內成了狼藉凌亂的局勢風姨的特厚於我確使我感恩不忘偶爾感覺太凉似乎需要換布質的衣裳又聽到四周的鳴蟲在啾啾喞又令我憧憬地以爲是新秋的深夜</p>
<p>我們住在這幽靜的曠野的爲人讚頌的江灣路上的人們比較那不足方丈的天井鴿籠式的弄堂的人們可謂化外之民了尤其是我樹木周繞着屋子的背身窗芬看去便是個佈置景緻的小花園式的網球塲眞可算是人間的天堂了雖然如此但畢竟是囚在屋子裏不及躺在大然的懷抱裏來得偉大人類的慾望是無止境的呵所以我每晚必得要經附近的公園去納凉那裏的景緻却大非學校內可比擬了虹口公園的廣敞在海上的各公園中要占首席位次了她有兆豐的幽靜不比外灘的龐雜每當月夜高低起伏的橋梁迂迴曲折的小徑頗富鄉味美的茅亭不等形狀的石頭葱蘢的樹木艷媚的花草一一輪廓顯明地呈現在眼前池荷發出芬芳濃郁的氤氳直透入人們的嗅覺池中的魚因爲禁止漁戶捉捕的緣故多不可言銀一般的五六雨長的白肚皮時當在水面上穿來穿去無其數的魚嘴在水面自由的喞唼着把那倒映在水中的月呷成粉碎更發出閃金的光輝遠遠地獨據一隅的音樂廳包孕着滿腔灰色的月光儼然似含蘊着無限的神秘綠草織成的地毯一望無艮隨意在草地上小坐仰首觀看那繊塵不染的靑天又是一一無垠宇宙間充滿了堅潔的詩意啊誰個心田及得上她的凈潔誰個的心境及得上她的遼闊我太渺小了呵渺小誰敢認爲是不渺小呢在這樣環境裏每個人兒只不過是滄海的一粟自然與人生人生偉大呢抑自然偉大呵呵我淘醉了淘醉得不知有醒我沉醉了好似沉睡在我母親那偉大仁慈愛的懷抱裏被愛得不知歸返我倨傲得渺視一切</p>
<p>唯其如此公園每晚是我必去的塲所</p>
<p>說也慚愧這種大自然的享受還是我弟弟給與我的哩當他學校未放假尙未搬進附近寄宿舍來的時候雖然有了門劵照樣靠近公園但從學校放假同學們返里了我無形中失了友伴後公園門口即未有我的足跡我竟沒有這樣勇氣這股膽最這還能算個人麼還說什麼獨立還配幹什麼婦女運動這種志願恐將永遠就是紙上談兵吧呵不並不是不敢更非沒有這般勇氣實在是不勝其煩無論你坐在什麼地方或什麼時候只要何是獨個兒總不愁沒有別人來陪伴你破你的寂寞看啥格書若是在白晝時用功呀熱來兮休息休息來白相一息當然總歸是不理無論怎樣麻煩都是一聲不響使他無從着手實在討厭不過時只有走開另調塲所但是他也有腿會跟着你的喂此地坐一息好吧蠻風凉格風直往格達吹他好似天文與地理的專家何苦再直走不理時他便有這樣一句人可必呢直跟直跟到跑出了園門晚間也和這相類似用功燈光不靈要看壞眼睛格倒很承人家有關錦注其餘都差不多一律結果終是不多時刻便走回來原來是爲欣賞自然和藉着這境界帶看書消遣而去的而所得收獲竟是這麼一齣啞劇在下意識的講一句這樣並不會於我有什麼妨害只是擾亂了人家的興致却又不勝其煩</p>
<p>如今呢有弟弟伴着每晚都要去納凉弟弟年齡雖然很小但身材都細而長儼然像似大人了在晚間看上去再也沒有人來驚擾一下我們很安然地在那大自然的懷抱裏消磨這優美的夏夜</p>
<p>但有時我去得略早弟弟尙未來我便打開書本翻閱同樣地照例又有人會來說那些使你不耐煩的話擾亂你興致這時這不勝其煩的一刻我只是在希望地新禱着弟弟快點來我暗自想着笑話弟弟竟變爲保護者</p>

<h3>悽傷的故事</h3>
<p>— 楊紹志</p>
<p>向培良作</p>
<p>誰都曉得文藝是能從多方面來激動人們的心靈使其有胆量地努力向前的</p>
<p>假使一時代的文藝是積極的向上的它自然就能發生出力量它就能指示人生它亦能爲民族求出路歷史上文藝產生過這種的功績已經是數見不鮮塞爾維亞人的民族意識有圓滿的發展其後與南斯洛伐人共同得到民族的政治獨立何常不是塞爾維亞人的民族的詩歌以及其民族英雄的忠實的史乘的助力所以說如果文藝家是時代的思想是正確的是肯奮鬬的他的作品當然是能予人生以偉大而堅忍的力導人生於努力光明的大道他更能燃燒起民族的火把使民族的意識而欣欣向榮</p>
<p>同時文藝還有一種作用就是去記載過去民族的史蹟它可以不管這是民族的光榮還是民族的厄運祗要它是以忠實底描摹把它寫成作品由這個民族傳到別一個民族由這一代傳到下一代那能完成它的一部分的使命</p>
<p>關於民族光榮的事實的記載固然能使人們知道愛慕民族的英雄發奮爲雄以增進民族的幸福但是民族意識消沉時代的寫眞民衆心靈頹廢的事實的紀實假使也把它儘量地披露出來我想亦一定是會刺激人們的心使他們感覺到民族情緒的鬆懈民衆的妄狂頹廢眼見到自己的民族表現出衰亡的象徵或許也會激發起他的固有的勇敢的精神燃燒起未滅的火把爲民族的生存而奮鬥吧總之祇要文藝是民族的無論它是從何方面寫述它總會賜給人們一種奮發的力換言之一切民族運動都是受它的民族文藝所激動</p>
<p>這篇悽傷的故事是向培良君的創作這篇創作中作者就是用最忠實的民族病寫眞的方法用以激起人們的自尊自强的心理的</p>
<p>幾千年來中國的知識份子很多都犯了一種淸高自傲的毛病一看着社會的齷濁又碰到不能實行他的理想他就會跑到山林中去過他的隱士逸士的生活他總不肯積極的再接再厲的幹下去悽傷的故事中的父親就是這樣的一個人物</p>
<p>父親是一個懷才淪落的人在什麼地方都保存着他的高傲尊貴他文章作的很好詩詞書畫朋輩裏面沒有趕上他的他是很早很早的日本留學生學的是採鑛專科在日本的時候就加入了同盟會回國以後他意思是要好好地爲社會爲國家幹一點事他也是那種能夠把全生命供獻於一種事業的人但是他後來知道我現在也知道了這樣的人社會是不需要的所以他只在民國二年作了一點事以後因爲和人家合不來所以遠遠走開了……</p>
<p>像這樣的父親在中國的社會裏眞不知有多少但這種淸高有什麼用呢我們曉得善人的勢力隱避了一分自然就可以給惡人的勢力囂張了一分這種個人自傲個人淸高的結果和想把全生命供獻於一種事業的初衷又竟成了如此底矛盾更就造成中華民族的一種病性形成這許許多多底官塲積習至於人民的懶問政事也都何常不是這種自命淸高的退爲隱士的缺陷有以成之作者已把它淋漓地暴露了我們難道沒有方法來興奮人們的心理嗎來努力吧努力地創造出有志者事竟成的自信心</p>
<p>但悽傷的故事中的母親却是個要强的要面子的婦人故事中告訴我們的是這樣的</p>
<p>母親是很要强的她一生沒有留過話柄給人家說她寗肯把自己的血和肉一點一點消耗盡我們在這個時候决不使別人看出我們的窘狀你父親是幹大事的人他生平沒有向誰低過頭要是只要稍微低頭的話他現在早已闊起來了我們無論如何要給他爭這口氣在夜裏作工很疲倦覺得不能支持的時候母親總是向我說這樣的話</p>
<p>她眞會克盡婦道在支離破碎的家庭中她還要硬勁地支撑着門楣使毫不露破碇有許多像這類的舊家庭中婦德的修養假使我們不要主觀太深肯以歷史的眼光去批判自然也還有些值得恭維的</p>
<p>這篇作品假使我們大意地從作品的字面上去領略自然祗感覺得它是充滿着出世和消沉底思想這種思想澎漲到頂點時人們自然會感覺着</p>
<p>我的生活是空洞中的空洞虛無中的虛無我什麼東四都把捉不住也沒有把捉什麼東西的願望甚至於連悲哀通沒有了只如同被風吹着的一點點浮雲不久就要消散了的現在你可以知道我爲什麼那樣沉溺於打牌的了一切的悲哀一切的痛楚一切的苦難却還是好受的還可以忍下去惟有可憐的空虛却非得設法子塡滿不可無論用什麼去換取在打牌的時候我可以什麼也不想我可以忘記就是爲這一個原因</p>
<p>一切的苦難却還是好受的還可以忍下去惟有可憐的空虛却非得設法子塡滿不可由此我們曉得痛楚苦難一切的一切還都沒有力量來支配人生惟有感覺到空虛失却了中心意識的時候才會逼着人們朝沒得法的消極的一條路上走這種描述民間底民族意識消沉的現象是如何底刻切呵</p>
<p>所以在這篇作品中我們倘肯用意識底把它深深地玩味我們就會領會出它的眞意義它是用指出你的壞處來給你一種激刺使你自己會去認識人生的眞諦再燃燒起你的未了的勇氣勇敢而努力地幹下去</p>
<h3>世界文學的故事（一八九）</h3>
<p>— 美國約翰瑪西著胡仲持譯</p>
<p>第四十八章　亞美利加的詩</p>
<p>作爲哈佛大學的講師又作爲衒學底詩的製造家繼郎匪羅而起的敎授詩人是羅厄爾他也明白他的亞美利加人底劣勢而並不由他的詩却由他的論文見於外國人中的一種謙讓試行了他的防禦底復讐以古典英語所寫的他的詩幾乎沒有什麼味道那因了在哈佛大學建以紀念死於南北戰爭的學生的建築物開幕式這一回事件而出名的紀念頌是單單修辭而已他在以舒緩的韻文所寫的爲批評家而作的寓言之中說了</p>
<p>帶了以韻文綑束的ISM一大束</p>
<p>努力要攀登帕那薩斯</p>
<p>云云以自責然而他在以紐英格蘭的揚基方言的文學底模倣構成的諷刺詩別格羅論說之中使那ISM自由地活躍了時却也偶然到達於他的最優的境地了那詩有着光輝諧謔和辛辣痛烈地摘發着亞美利加的政治上的愚行亞美利加的諷刺詩而保着那麼外長的生命者另外可沒有了爲什麼呢因爲諷刺這東西是利牠生了根的那時代的事情一同凋萎的脆弱的草而亞美利加的諷刺家與其是作詩家倒是散文的作家</p>
<p>住於却爾斯河的對岸的羅厄爾的友人和謨茲博士也是以擬揚基方言寫了單馬的馬車時在關於他的詩的範圍內達於最高的地點雖是和謨茲博士的最大的讚美者雖是至少在獨裁家中見到文體的天才的人也不能很認眞地取他的認眞的詩然而他在慶賀階級融合與其他愉快的事件的隨時所作的詩却是聰明奇警快活的人物</p>
<p>康科特的賢者愛默生本來是散文的作家他的散文有些是雄辯而富於想像的他還寫了不亞於許多並非天賦的詩人的作家的詩愛默生對於他的友人托洛嘗說他的桃金娘和麝香草沒有全然化爲蜜這正是佳妙地說明了愛默生的詩的話可是有一兩次愛默生也奏出了眞實的詩底調兒在蜜蜂之中則極快活的戶外空氣的調兒而在梵天之中則更深一層的哲學底調兒他的其餘的詩似乎較之他的散文少有閃爍的空想似的</p>

After abandoning Jinan, the Northern Army will likely gather on the north bank of the Yellow River to prevent the Southern Army from advancing north. However, [T13]1[/T] abandoning Jinan will affect the morale of the entire army, [T13]2[/T] will lead to an unfavorable situation on the Longhai Line, [T13]3[/T] will negatively impact the attitude of the three northeastern provinces towards the North, and [T13]4[/T] will greatly hinder the issue of establishing a Northern government. Therefore, key figures in the North are extremely distraught. (Electric Communication Society Dispatch)</p>

<h3>New Budgets of France and Japan</h3>
<p>One of the most difficult aspects of a nation's economic life is the mismatch between income and expenditure. In recent years, due to the changing global environment, the nature and scope of budgets in major countries have also changed accordingly. Income from taxes and other sources cannot be forcibly increased, while expenditure has been increasing sharply and rapidly every year. As a result, the gap between income and expenditure has widened, and the budget problem has become more difficult year by year. According to financial experts, the reasons for the sudden increase in expenditure in various countries include, in addition to military expenditures, the rising of general price levels, the incessant increase in population, and the gradual expansion of all facilities and institutions in the process of national progress. Therefore, the necessary operating expenses of the government cannot but increase accordingly. The government's expenditure is faced with a situation of inevitable sudden increase, while income is affected by the sluggishness of industry and commerce. Not only cannot it increase, but it may even decrease. This difficult phenomenon is common to all major countries. Taking France and Japan as examples, the French cabinet has announced that the budget has increased year by year, with the 1931 budget reaching six billion francs, most of the increase being for national defense. The naval expenditure in Japan's 1931 budget will exceed thirty million yuan. Even with extreme cuts, it will still be necessary to raise more than ten million yuan. Regarding this shortfall, the French authorities say that without adding new taxes or issuing public bonds, it will be impossible to offset the expenditure. Although the Japanese authorities are strongly advocating a policy of not increasing taxes or issuing bonds, they will inevitably have to resort to both today. If this is the case for France and Japan, then other major countries will not be much different. Budgets increase year after year, and the result is nothing more than increasing taxes and issuing bonds. In other words, it is simply increasing the burden on the people every year. Alas, how can this be a sustainable path?</p>

<h3>League of Nations Adds Secretaries</h3>
<p>Italian opposition because it weakens the power of small countries.</p>
<p>Geneva, 14th (Guomin News Agency): Italy has submitted a note to the Secretariat of the League of Nations opposing the plan to increase the number of secretaries from five to nine. It believes that this move will not only fail to increase the power of small countries and achieve the intended purpose, but will actually weaken it. This is because after the number of secretaries increases to nine, it will actually be equivalent to having no help at all. All truly important decisions will be in the hands of the Secretary-General (an Englishman) and the Deputy Secretary-General (a Frenchman). Italy deliberately advocates maintaining the status quo, but a committee should be formed by the secretaries, the Secretary-General, the Deputy Secretary-General, and legal advisors. Each member has equal decision-making power. Unless unanimously approved, the proposal cannot be established. It is heard that this note will be submitted for discussion at the meeting in September.</p>

<h3>Instigates Kurdish Rebellion</h3>
<p>English officials deny this. The Persian army assisted in suppressing the rebellion, and the heads of two chiefs were displayed.</p>
<p>London, 14th (Guomin News Agency): Officials formally deny that Colonel Lawrence, who is well-known in Arabia, is currently residing in Kurdistan and instigating Kurdish tribes to invade Turkish territory. It is said that Lawrence is still serving as an aviation officer at the British Shahrukh Army Airfield.</p>
<p>Ankara, 14th (Guomin News Agency): The Turkish government has re-sent a note to Persia proposing that the two countries jointly suppress Kurdish rebels. According to newspaper reports, the Turkish government is prepared to compensate Persia with territory in the area currently occupied by the Turkish army. Currently, the Turkish army continues to advance in the triangular area northwest of Maromaya, and the Persian border guards have apparently also pursued Kurdish rebels. According to news from Beijing, Persian soldiers clashed with 100 Kurdish tribesmen, resulting in 22 deaths and 11 serious injuries. The heads of two Kurdish chiefs were also displayed. This act can be regarded as a display of Persia's goodwill towards Turkey and has left a deep impression here.</p>
<p>Statements by Officials from Former German-Occupied Territories</p>
<h3>Spark Polish Protests</h3>
<p>Considering damaging relationship between the two countries</p>
<p>Warsaw, 14th (Reuters): Polish Foreign Minister Zaleski met with the German chargé d'affaires today and lodged a formal protest regarding the statements made by Dr. Trautwein, an official from former German-occupied territories, on August 10th. He said that such statements make it impossible to improve German-Polish relations. It is noted that at the tenth anniversary of the East Prussia Citizens' Congress, Dr. Trautwein spoke about the German Eastern Frontier issue, saying that the allocation of land east of the Vistula River to Poland was a serious blow to Germany's eastern wing. Poland's future can only be guaranteed if German-Polish relations are no longer constantly in a state of unease due to unjust borders. He also said that we cannot help but feel resentment when we see land that was once ours now lost. But there will eventually be a day when it is recovered. A war for justice will eventually break out to liberate Germany and Europe.</p>

<h3>Indian Opium Exports to China Cease</h3>
<p>Declaration by the Governor-General of India at the Opium Conference, also stating that Indian opium consumption has decreased.</p>
<p>Calcutta News: A recent opium conference was held in Simla, with representatives from all local governments in India attending to discuss how to fulfill India's obligations to the League of Nations regarding opium prohibition. The conference was held in secret, and the Governor-General gave an opening speech, stating that the Indian government, provincial governments, and the people of India can declare that in recent years, especially after 1924, much work has been done to prevent India's internal and external opium policies from being reasonably attacked. Local governments and administrative agencies have worked together to carry out education and enlighten the people. As a result, in the ten years before 1928-29, the total amount of opium consumed in India had decreased from 459,177 sear to 277,053 sear. Furthermore, the average consumption per 100,000 people decreased from 1883 to 1120 per year. At the beginning of 1926, the Indian government declared its intention to completely eliminate opium exports to the Far East within ten years by means of gradual reduction, regardless of the annual tax revenue of 4 crore rupees. Its final export will be seen in 1935, thus completing the foundation laid in 1914 for the final end of opium exports to China. Also, during the above-mentioned period, all opium fields in British India have also been reduced from 207,000 acres to 48,000 acres. (World)</p>

<h3>He Jian Commands Troops to Recapture Liuyang</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: After the Communist bandit Peng Dehuai withdrew from Changsha, the entire army fled towards Liuyang. He Jian mobilized his troops to pursue and suppress them. He departed from the province on the morning of the 10th to personally command the troops. On the same day, the various armies were mobilized simultaneously from Yong'an City and advanced towards Jiaoxi Ridge. They were divided into three columns, with Dai Douyuan commanding the 16th Division as the first column, Li Jue commanding the 19th Division as the second column, and Tao Guang commanding the 31st Division as the third column. He himself personally commanded the front line in Yong'an City. On the 10th, there was a slight contact with the Communist bandits in Fengjiang Bridge, Dongyang City, and other places. The Communist bandits were defeated in every battle. Dai Douyuan's and Li Jue's brigades occupied the mountainous area of Jiaoxi Ridge on the afternoon of the 10th. On the 11th, Dai Douyuan's brigade again pursued Liuyang County from Jiaoxi towards the county seat, engaging in fierce battles with the bandits in the Zhangshu Bridge area. Hundreds of bandits were killed. Because the bandits lost their important positions, they retreated to defend Liuyang County. The various armies all pursued to the city of Liuyang and surrounded and attacked it fiercely. After two hours of fierce fighting, the Communist bandits launched repeated assaults, suffering 3,000 to 4,000 casualties. Finally, they were forced out of the east of Liuyang City and fled towards the border of Jiangxi through Xiahu. Liuyang County was then first recaptured by Liu Yijing's regiment of Dai Douyuan's brigade at 6 p.m. on the 11th. He Jian encamped at Jiaoxi Ridge on the evening of the 11th and decided to enter Liuyang City early on the 12th to command the pursuit towards the Pingjiang area. Peng Dehuai's scattered bandits were scattered in Jinjing and Gaoqiao in groups of two to three hundred or one to two hundred. There were also several thousand in the area. He Jian has now requested that Luo Lin, commander of the newly formed 20th Division, lead two brigades from Yuezhou to Qingjiang and one brigade from Miluo to Qingjing and Gaoqiao. Commander Luo himself has already come to the province to discuss everything with Acting Chairman Cao Bowen and others. It has been decided that he will personally go to Miluo on the 12th to command the attack, and Changsha will not be peaceful until Ping and Liu are completely cleared. In recent days, Changsha residents have been confused by rumors spread by the Communist bandits, and the people's hearts have inevitably been shaken. The price of ship tickets from Changsha to Hankou, which is usually only 3 yuan, has recently risen to a huge 70 yuan per ticket due to the crowding of passengers. Sometimes the ships are anchored in the river and do not dock. Hiring a boat to board the ship also costs 10 to 8 yuan per person. Such a chaotic situation has never been seen before. The military police authorities, in order to ensure that there are no Communist bandit remnants spreading rumors in the city in an attempt to disrupt the rear, have immediately ordered the military police to fill all important passes to prohibit people from moving without reason, and have also strictly arrested rumor-mongers. On the 11th, the street patrol team of the General Headquarters arrested Deng Jiuxi and Huang Duheng, two people who were casually spreading rumors on the street in Simenkou. The street patrol team of the Public Security Bureau arrested Zhang Zhengrong, a rumor-monger, in Xiaoximen. The investigators of the Garrison Command arrested Dong Fuyou and Chen Busheng, two rumor-mongers, in Nanmenkou. All of them were executed on the spot, and the rumor subsided and the people's hearts gradually calmed down. The people of Changsha have fled several times and have almost fled more than half of them. Now the market is deserted and sparsely populated. As for the hooligans and local bullies who helped the Communists to abuse, more than a thousand people have been arrested since the Fourth Route Army arrived in the province. In recent days, there have been groups of thirty to forty people or more than ten people who have been tied up and taken to the outside of the city, to the riverbank, or to the Education Association Square to be shot in turn. There have already been hundreds of people. Currently, Hunan Province is completely in a military situation. Although the Provincial Government has resumed office at the Youth Association site, in fact, there is still no official business to be done, and only four of the thirteen members of the Provincial Government are currently in the province: Cao Bowen, Zhang Kailian, Zeng Jixu, and Cao Dianqiu. The various halls, offices, and yamen have all been burned, and the various halls have not yet found a place to conduct business. The progress of provincial administration may still take time.</p>

<h3>The War Situation in Fujian Province Eases</h3>
<p>Lu's Main Force Avoids Conflict, Zhou Zhiqin's Brigade Surrenders to the Province</p>
<p>A Fuzhou dispatch recently reported that Lu Xingbang's forces, in order to avoid direct conflict with the main provincial army and hinder its advance, have changed their strategy and colluded with bandits to carry out widespread looting and disrupt local areas. In the Fu'an and Ningde areas, they have allied with He Jinbiao's bandit gang of over 2,000 in Pingnan, occupying Songxi and Zhenghe counties. The provincial government dispatched the second brigade of the provincial police, led by Liu Zongyi, advancing from Ningde and Shouning, and initially repelled He's forces. However, shortly thereafter, He returned from Songxi and launched a counterattack, recapturing the county seat. Liu's forces retreated to the border area between Zhenghe and Ningde to hold their ground temporarily. He's bandits then planned to invade Ningde and threaten the Fu'an area. Liu Zongyi telegraphed the province for emergency assistance. The land force headquarters dispatched Jin Zhenzhong's brigade and Liu Gangde's regiment to provide aid. In the Fuzhou area, they colluded with Huang Baoyun's bandit gang of over 1,000 in Minqing, invading the western district of Minhou and the southern route of Yongtai. They also contacted scattered small local bandit gangs and, with the supply of bullets from Lu's forces, became quite rampant. The provincial government has ordered Liang Jichuan, the head of the first brigade of the provincial police stationed in Yongtai, and Huang Bingwu, the commander for bandit suppression in the western part of Minhou, to cooperate in encircling and suppressing them. Liang and Huang recently traveled to the province together to meet with Yang Shuzhuang and Liu Heding to seek instructions and, after receiving bullets, returned to their defenses and separately dispatched troops. In the southern Fujian area, Lu's forces further utilized the bandits between Datian and Dehua as a buffer for the war. These people were also greedy for Lu's money and ammunition, engaging in superficial cooperation and mutual exploitation. However, a source of concern for Lu's forces was Chen Huisheng's bandit gang in Gutian. For the past two months, Chen's bandits, taking advantage of the deployment of Lu's troops to the front lines, have specialized in harassing and looting Gutian, Jian'ou, Zhiping, and Minqing counties in his rear, attacking east and west. Lu's forces have been unable to do anything about it. Recently, they have further joined forces with small bandit gangs from Ningde, Luoyuan, Pingnan, and Minhou counties, including Lu Guangxu, Yu Tingcai, Jiang Peiji, Jiangxi Zimao, Qi Qitao, Chen Xiadi, and Chen Yaonan, gathering to over 3,000 people, creating a situation of the guest overshadowing the host in Lu's defense area. Lu Xingrong was forced to ask someone to negotiate peace with them, but because Chen's bandits put forward very harsh conditions, a compromise has not yet been reached.</p>
<p>The announcement of the third phase of the campaign against Lu by the army, navy, and air force has been made for many days, but it has not been launched for a long time. It is rumored that this is actually because the internal situation on Lu's side has changed, and the defense line has been shortened, so the armies campaigning against Lu are holding back and waiting. Zhou Zhiqin's brigade, since last month, took advantage of a rainy night to attempt to attack the Xiaobeiling position. After being repelled by Liu's division, they realized that the provincial defenses were solid and difficult to penetrate, and the southern Fujian army had already moved out of Quanzhou and entered Datian and Dehua. Knowing that there was no hope of advancing and that there was a risk of being surrounded, they sent people to Fang Shengtao to intercede, expressing their willingness to break away from Lu Xingbang and station their troops at the junction of western and northern Fujian to await orders. After Fang sought instructions, Yang Shuzhuang and Yang Bayun granted the request. Yang made a statement yesterday, saying that the surrender of Zhou's forces had been negotiated and completed, and the troops on the front line had already begun to move. Lu Xingrong was unable to stop it. However, Chen Rongbiao's independent regiment of Lu's forces, who were defending the northern route with Zhou's forces, also expressed their willingness to surrender to the province, seeing that the general situation was over. However, Yang believes that Chen's nature has always been fickle. After the eleventh year of the Republic, he first attached himself to Lu Xingbang to attack Li Houji and Wang Yongquan and gained power. Then he left Lu and surrendered to Wang. After being driven away, he surrendered to Zhou Yinren to attack Lu Xingbang. After Zhou fled, he returned to Lu to resist the province. Now, seeing that Lu has lost power, he has come to ask to surrender again, fearing that it may not be sincere. Therefore, it is still under consideration. Now, Chen, seeing that Zhou had led his troops away, also automatically retreated from Beiling to Cailing, more than ten miles away, and dismantled all defensive works to show his sincerity towards the provincial government. Therefore, there are no enemy troops in the northern route. Lu Xingrong's Xin Ming brigades, which were defending the western route, saw that the northern route had suddenly withdrawn its troops and lost their mutually supportive position. They also urgently shortened their defense line, retreating from Cunzhi to Zhuqi. Therefore, the situation has recently become more moderate. Part of Liu's division's troops on the front line have moved from the mountains to the foothills for rest and recuperation. The order in the city of Dingzhou has returned to the pre-war state. The various shop associations and Jia have successively stopped operating, and passage is unimpeded at night. West Lake and South Lake parks, which were previously deserted, are now crowded with tourists again. (August 13th)</p>
<h3>Siam Restricts Chinese Immigrants</h3>
<p>A Shantou dispatch states that the world's unemployment problem has triggered a wave of concern. Various countries, in order to seek their own stability, regard the relief of the unemployed and the problems of population and food as urgent matters to be resolved. The British and Dutch possessions in Southeast Asia have successively promulgated regulations restricting Chinese immigrants. The people of Chaozhou and Meizhou have been greatly affected by this. Every year, 120,000 strong men pass through Shantou to seek a living abroad. Due to the restrictions of the new regulations in Singapore, the quota per ship has been reduced by 70% during the year. This surplus population may migrate to Siam. However, the Siamese government has recently promulgated new regulations restricting the entry of foreigners. Siam is a place of timber and rice production. There are about 2 million Chinese engaged in agriculture, industry, and commerce in that country, occupying an important position. After the promulgation of this regulation, people in southern China will suffer a major blow in their livelihood. The restriction regulations are listed as follows: (Article 1) This law is called the BE 2470 Immigration Law. (Article 2) This law shall take effect on July 11, BE 2470.

Passengers are prohibited from leaving the ship before obtaining a permit from the inspector; 2.

The inspector shall be given considerable convenience to facilitate the inspection. (Article 6) The following foreigners are prohibited from entering Siam: 1. Those who do not have a passport or certificate of nationality issued by a government recognized by the Siamese government; 2. Those suffering from any disease that the minister has declared for this purpose in the Government Gazette; 3. Those who have not been vaccinated and are unwilling to be vaccinated according to the law; 4. Those who do not have independent income or assistance and are certified by a health inspector to have physical or mental defects or diseases, and therefore cannot make a living; 5. Those who are of improper conduct or are suspected of disturbing public order or endangering the safety of Siam. Those who do not have the passport or certificate of nationality stipulated in item 1 of this article may be allowed to enter Siam after obtaining a certificate from the inspector. The items contained in this certificate shall be stipulated by the minister and may be subject to a small fee. The passport and certificate of nationality stipulated in item 1 of this article shall not apply to diplomats, consuls, and their dependents stationed in Siam, or foreign government officials who have been formally notified by the Siamese government, as well as foreign sailors who dock in Siamese ports or bays. In any of the following circumstances, the Minister shall have the power to issue the restrictions in item 1 of this article: a. Passengers traveling on the Siamese railway who only pass through Siamese territory to go to foreign countries; b. Residents of neighboring countries who only make a temporary crossing. (Article 7) The Minister, in consultation with the Minister of Commerce and Transportation, shall have the power to issue orders stipulating the amount of money that foreigners should bring when entering Siam. This order shall not apply to children under the age of 15 who come to Siam with their parents. Any order issued by the Minister shall be published in the Government Gazette and may be changed or revoked by the same procedure. Three months after the publication of the aforementioned order, foreigners must bring the stipulated amount of money before they can enter Siam. (Article 8) The Minister, in consultation with the Minister of Commerce and Transportation, shall have the power to issue an order limiting the number of foreigners allowed to enter Siam each year, or their categories. This order must be published in the Government Gazette three months before it takes effect. The Ministers may also revoke it. The revocation order shall be published in the Government Gazette. After the aforementioned order takes effect, the number of foreigners entering Siam shall not exceed the specified quota. (Article 9) The provisions of Articles 7 and 8, or the orders issued regarding the preceding article, shall not apply to the following foreigners: 1. Foreigners entering Siam who are diplomats or consuls, or who are serving in the government; 2. Foreigners entering Siam for tourism who the inspector considers to be temporarily residing or transiting and have no intention of residing in Siam for a long time, nor engaging in ordinary work, trade, or business. (Article 10) Notwithstanding the provisions of this law, the Minister may, at his discretion, specially permit any foreigner to enter Siam under certain circumstances. (August 11th)</p>
<h3>Second Examination for County Magistrates in Jiangsu Province</h3>

All candidates complied with the notification of the Examination Committee and gathered at the school at 5:30 am and 2:30 pm to be called by name. All the arrangements in the examination hall were roughly the same as the first examination. At 5:30 am, the bell rang, and Chief Examiner Ye Chucang called the roll.

<h3>Establishment of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters in Southern Anhui</h3>
<p>A Conference of Counties to Suppress Bandits Will Be Convened</p>
<p>A Wuhu dispatch states that after Wei Lihuang, the Commander-in-Chief for Bandit Suppression in Anhui Province, convened the Anhui Provincial Bandit Suppression Conference, in order to fundamentally eliminate the bandit scourge, the entire province will be divided into seven bandit suppression zones, each with a bandit suppression commander. Southern Anhui, including eleven counties such as Wuhu, Xuancheng, Nanling, Dangtu, Fanchang, Taiping, Guangde, Langxi, Jingxian, and Jingde, is the sixth bandit suppression zone, and Lu Xueshu, the head of the Capital Garrison Regiment, is appointed as the bandit suppression commander. When Lu led his troops to Wuhu, he made great efforts to suppress the bandit scourge in the various counties of southern Anhui. After being commissioned, he led Yang Zhenya's newly compiled replenishment camp and a company of Anhui assault artillery and machine guns on the Taihe steamship to Wuhu on the 12th. The regimental headquarters is still located in the Huizhou Guild Hall. At 10:00 am today, Lu convened a Wuhu local security meeting at the regimental headquarters, gathering the head of the Public Security Bureau, the county magistrate of Wuhu, the head of the Municipal Administration Office, the training officer of the chamber of commerce, the head of the self-defense regiment, the director of the Fifth Military Hospital for the Wounded, and members of the chamber of commerce. It was decided that the defense of the urban area would be divided into sections, with Yang's battalion of the garrison regiment, the Public Security Bureau, the security team, and the chamber of commerce being responsible separately, and invisible martial law would be implemented. After 12:00 pm every night, pedestrians can be inspected. The prevention in the countryside is the responsibility of the self-defense regiment and the third battalion of the garrison regiment. Regarding the management of the wounded, there are currently more than 700 people in the hospital. In the future, if 100 people recover, they will be transferred to the front and returned to the team. No more than 40 people may go out daily due to business, and they must wear an entry and exit permit, otherwise they will be treated as vagrants. The Sixth District Bandit Suppression Headquarters is scheduled to be established tomorrow. The organizational structure of each department is generally concurrently held by the officers of the regimental headquarters, but a military law office is established separately. Lu is also scheduled to be sworn in tomorrow morning at 8:00 am. Regarding the method of eliminating the bandit scourge within the Sixth District, it was decided to convene the county magistrates of eleven counties such as Wuhu and Dangtu to a meeting in Wuhu. Notifications have already been sent out, but because the roads to Taiping and other counties are relatively far away, it will probably take about 20 days before it can be held. As for the bandit gang entrenched in Wuhua Mountain, Fanchang, in addition to the infantry regiment that has been encircling, it was decided to send two more infantry companies and a mortar and machine gun company to encircle and suppress them within a day or two in order to eliminate them. The first and second battalions of that regiment are still stationed in Nanjing, waiting to be transferred to Anhui and assigned work when all counties in the district launch a large-scale bandit suppression operation in the future.

The Zhenjiang shipping industry learned of this and immediately submitted a petition to the Zhenjiang Customs, alleging that the construction by Dada Steamer was inconsistent with customs regulations. The Customs Inspector also believed it would be detrimental and ordered the Port Director to conduct an on-site survey.

Both sides have now understood the various misunderstandings. The joint notification from Dean He and Chamber of Commerce Head Wang is recorded below: “On the evening of the 9th of this month, wounded soldiers from this hospital passed by Souchang Street, where a misunderstanding and conflict occurred with several workers from Yuan Desheng's construction factory. The members of this Chamber of Commerce mediated and resolved the dispute, which also caused misunderstandings. Subsequently, troops stationed in the area arrived to stop the conflict. The entire body of wounded soldiers at this hospital is now in order, and the members of this Chamber of Commerce have returned to their posts. Both sides have reached an understanding, and there is no further incident. However, there have been many rumors and discussions in the streets in recent days.

The team secretly dispatched detectives to rescue the kidnapped child. It has now been learned that the mastermind behind the case is Liu Futian (alias Little Monk), Liu Wanxing's cousin. He was jealous of his brother's wealth and, due to his usual unsatisfied loan requests, colluded with the bandits to carry out the robbery. After the case was solved, Futian fled without a trace. A few days ago, the suspect returned to his hometown, thinking that the authorities would not pursue the matter after so many days, but was discovered by the Investigation Team. They immediately dispatched detectives Shao Shigui and others to arrest the suspect, who was handed over to the court for punishment yesterday (the 13th) afternoon.</p>

<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>The Ma Brothers Nearly Kidnapped: Ma Zhangquan and his younger brother Fuchun, who live in the sandy area of Di Yu Village, northeast of Xincang, received threatening letters some days ago demanding a large sum of money. The Ma brothers ignored the letters. Yesterday (the 12th) afternoon, three bandits hid behind Fuchun's house and tried to kidnap his son Alai when he went outside. Alai fled south in a hurry. At that time, Zhangquan's son Ajin happened to be in the waterwheel shed, and immediately ran wildly when he saw the situation. The bandits chased them for more than a mile. When they passed the Caijia Weir, Alai continued to flee south, while Ajin turned west. The bandits, thinking that the area was close to Xincang, fired several shots with their handguns, but fortunately missed. They then gave up the chase and escaped.</p>
<p>Two Suicide Attempts Prevented: Last night at dusk at the Sanhuan Dong Bridge in this city, many people were gathered on top of the bridge to enjoy the cool air.

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<h3>Letter from the Chonggu Office of the Baihejiang Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>To the esteemed newspaper: We were deeply surprised to read a local news item in the June 6th edition concerning a business dispute in Chonggu Town, Qingpu. Our office would like to state that we attempted to mediate the dispute. After the incident occurred, Guangfengyi, Yichangfu, and others reported the matter to our office and requested a meeting to impartially judge the merits of the case. However, public opinion had already decided on the merits of both parties. Because the two stores are neighbors across the street, they should maintain harmony. Therefore, the result of the meeting was that Yichangfu would abide by business ethics and seek business development in a proper manner. Jiang, a partner of Guangfengyi, threw yarn at the counter of Yichangfu, leading to an argument. His temper was excessive and should be admonished. Both parties then reconciled. The claim in your newspaper that Guangfengyi apologized to Yichangfu is not true. Therefore, we are writing to request a correction in order to avoid confusion.

<h3>Letter from the Public Security Bureau of Jiangsu Provincial Capital</h3>
<p>To the esteemed newspaper: We have read the news item in the August 13th edition under the "Domestic News" section concerning a conflict between wounded soldiers and police in Zhenjiang. It does not match the facts. After this incident occurred, the branch director of our bureau handled it in accordance with police regulations and did not act improperly. However, because police officers and soldiers were beaten and the branch director was tied up, our bureau had to take appropriate security measures to prevent further escalation. Later, after the branch director returned, the provincial authorities, in order to maintain security in the rear, took appropriate peaceful measures. There was no panic in the city. Many of the facts in your dispatch are incorrect, and we request that you make a correction to clarify the truth. The location of the incident is under the jurisdiction of our bureau's Seventh Branch, not the Third Branch. Combined statement, Public Security Bureau of Jiangsu Provincial Capital, August 14th.</p>

<h3>Third Day of the International University Games</h3>
<p>Germany Firmly in First Place with Two New Records</p>
<p>Darmstadt, Germany, August 9 (Dispatch): The third day of the International University Games saw the venue as crowded as ever, with barely any room to move. One of the five events from yesterday was still incomplete due to rain. The first event today was the 1500-meter run of the pentathlon. The overall winner was Finnish athlete Dele Morttinen. The first place in the high jump and discus finals was also won by Finland. Great Britain won first place in the 1500-meter run, and Germany won first place in the 400-meter relay. According to the statistics, Germany has a total score of 64 points in the three days, firmly securing the championship. Japan has 40 points and is expected to be the runner-up. Finland is catching up with a score of 29 points, which is an excellent result. The details of each event on the day are as follows:</p>
<p>[T13]1[/T] 400-Meter Relay Final</p>
<p>First Place: German Team (Schaal, Zigan, Rudolf, Merchila, Gizibi) 41.9 seconds</p>
<p>Second Place: Japanese Team (Sasaki, Oshima, Nakajima, Yoshioka) 42.4 seconds</p>
<p>Third Place: Hungarian Team 43 seconds</p>
<p>The competition between the German and Japanese teams was fierce. The final leg, between Yoshioka and Gizibi, was a see-saw battle, making this race one of the most exciting events for the spectators.</p>
<p>[T13]2[/T] High Jump Final</p>
<p>First Place: Laniga (Finland) 1.90 meters</p>
<p>Second Place: Kazuo Kimura (Japan) 1.87 meters</p>
<p>Third Place: Latiou (Germany) 1.835 meters</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Bieyingu (Germany) 1.83 meters</p>
<p>Japan's Kimura was initially expected to win first place, as he had jumped 1.96 meters in his home country. The reasons for his failure this time were that his approach was too relaxed and he had injured his foot during practice. Kimura participated in the official competition while enduring the pain. When the height was raised to 1.81 meters, there were still 11 people left. When the height was raised to 1.84 meters, there were only 5 people left. When it reached 1.87 meters, only Japan's Kimura and Finland's Laniga jumped over it. When it reached 1.90 meters, Laniga jumped over it in one attempt, while Kimura failed in three attempts. Kimura's results were therefore buried. Kimura's eyes were filled with tears when he left the venue. Finnish athletes Yoshizawa and Oda also participated in the high jump, both jumping to 1.80 meters before being eliminated.</p>
<p>[T13]3[/T] Discus Final</p>
<p>(First to Sixth Place: New Conference Records)</p>
<p>First Place: Hula (Finland) 45.07 meters</p>
<p>Second Place: Fiyanduoman (Australia) 43.97 meters</p>
<p>Third Place: Dalani (Hungary) 43.49 meters</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Viyili (Finland) 42.31 meters</p>
<p>Fifth Place: Vanuxianku (Finland) 42.27 meters</p>
<p>Sixth Place: Bangjini (Italy) 41.11 meters</p>
<p>From first to sixth place, all the results broke the conference record.</p>
<p>[T13]4[/T] Pentathlon Results</p>
<p>(First to Fifth Place: New Conference Records)</p>
<p>First Place: Dele Morttinen (Finland) 3986.66 points</p>
<p>Second Place: Timusha (Ridlan) 3762.277 points</p>
<p>Third Place: Latieyibi (Germany) 3724.277 points</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Hagusharuman (Hungary) 3526.16 points</p>
<p>Fifth Place: Bangbilugu (Sweden) 3517.707 points</p>
<p>Sixth Place: Halusha (Belgium) 3446.24 points</p>
<p>From first to fifth place, all were new records. Japanese athlete Yoshizawa's score in the final 1500-meter run was not good, with a total score of 3396 points, placing him eighth.</p>
<p>[T13]5[/T] 1500-Meter Final</p>
<p>First Place: Yen Lukovus (Great Britain) 4 minutes 1 second 7</p>
<p>Second Place: Ludi Yugu (France) 4 minutes 3 seconds</p>
<p>Third Place: Darlukus (Sweden) 4 minutes 4 seconds</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Ruobangsun (Germany) 4 minutes 4 seconds 1</p>
<p>Fifth Place: Bi Lubaf (Netherlands) Sixth Place: Gulawa (Germany)</p>
<p>[T13]6[/T] 1600-Meter Relay Preliminary Round</p>
<p>The Japanese team took advantage, and Germany, Sweden, Hungary, France, Italy, and Great Britain won the right to the final.</p>
<p>The total team scores for the three days are as follows:</p>
<p>Germany: 64 points</p>
<p>Japan: 40 points</p>

<p>First Act of the Shanghai Rotary Cup Tennis Preliminary</p>
<h3>The United States and Japan Each Win a Singles Match</h3>
<p>Japan's Machida wins 3-0 against the United States' Smith. The United States' Squires wins 3-1 against Japan's Kitao.</p>
<p>Today, two groups of singles matches will be held between England and Switzerland, and Germany and Portugal, respectively. One group of doubles matches will be held between the United States and Japan.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rotary Cup Tennis Tournament began yesterday at the Chinese Tennis Court. The United States and Japan were the first to compete. A total of two singles matches were held, and Japan won the first singles match 3-0, while the United States won the second singles match 3-1. The situation is equal, and the outcome is undecided. Today will be the doubles match between the United States and Japan (starting at 4:30 pm), as well as a group of singles matches each between Germany and Portugal and England and Switzerland.</p>
<h3>Machida Shows Ability with a Straight-Set Victory</h3>
<p>Machida, the first singles player for Japan, is highly regarded for his excellent technique. His serve is varied, and his forehand is powerful. Smith, the player for the United States, excels at volleying. The closeness of the second set and the pursuit in the third set demonstrate his skill in this area. However, on average, he is not as good as Machida, so he lost all three sets. The scores for the three sets are as follows. The referee was Xu Zhendong.</p>
<p>First Set Score</p>
<p>Smith Machida 3-5 0-4 1-4 4-6 4-2 2-4 4-2 0-4 8-1 1-3</p>
<p>Second Set Score</p>
<p>Smith Machida 4-6 4-1 4-1 2-4 2-4 0-4 6-8 4-0 4-1 3-5 3-3 4-3</p>
<p>Third Set Score</p>
<p>Smith Machida 4-1 1-4 4-2 4-0 4-6 3-5 2-4 4-6 0-4 6-2 2-2 3</p>
<h3>Squires Works Hard to Defeat His Opponent</h3>
<p>The battle between the second singles players of the United States and Japan was even more ferocious than the first singles match. The players displayed left-handed and right-handed shots, making for a spectacular display. The American Squires had a powerful serve and occupied a favorable position. However, the young hero was somewhat unruly and often overdid it. Squires repeatedly made this mistake, which led to his defeat in the second set. Fortunately, his opponent Kitao was less skilled than Squires. From the observation of the artillery fire between the two sides, Kitao's defense was not solid and was often broken by Squires' feints. The fate of the two teams was determined in the third set, as they had each won a set before. Squires' final victory was also the result of his hard work in the third set. After Kitao lost momentum in the third set, he collapsed in the fourth set. As a result, the American Squires won 6-3, 4-6, 8-6, and 6-2. The referee was Lin Baohua. The scores for the four sets are as follows:</p>
<p>First Set Score</p>
<p>Kitao Squires 1-4 3-5 4-2 2-4 4-2 5-3 2-4 3-5 4-6 8-2 5-3</p>
<p>Second Set Score</p>
<p>Kitao Squires 0-4 2-4 4-0 2-4 4-2 5-7 7-5 4-0 4-2 4-1 6-3 9-2</p>

<h3>Tilden Booed</h3>
<p>Leaves the Court Before the End of the Match</p>
<p>(New York, 14th Telegraph) The world-renowned American tennis player Tilden, who is participating in this year's Davis Cup finals between the United States and France, played against Klife Wut in a repeat match at the Oriental Taff Court in New York on the 14th. Tilden lost the first set 1-6 and then lost four games in a row in the second set. The crowd showed their contempt for Tilden's loss of momentum and booed him, making it unbearable for him. Tilden walked to the net and shook hands with his opponent, then left the court. It is also reported that Tilden left the court because he could not bear the booing of the crowd.</p>
<p>The reason was that he took advantage of his opponent's limp and attacked his weak points. Tilden said to his opponent when shaking hands, "I have heard enough booing." It is reported that Tilden has previously made many unintentional actions towards officials and the crowd.</p>

<p>The amateur tennis competition at the City No. 1 Public Sports Field was originally scheduled to end yesterday, but the tie-breaking matches in the Elimination Group were still ongoing, so it had to be postponed. At 7 pm, all the members gathered for a dinner. Field Director Wang Zhuangfei reported on the progress of the competition, and then Chen, the Director of the City Education Bureau, gave a speech of encouragement and presented the championship prizes for the completed groups in order. The event ended at 10 pm.

<p>In the Method Group, which has the highest level of skill, there were originally four outstanding players, namely Guo Qijian, Shen Yongnian, Yuan Shilong, and Wang Wuchen. Guo had already won the championship in the previous competition, so although he was allowed to participate in this year's competition, he was not allowed to compete for the championship in order to avoid reducing the interest of his fellow members. As a result of the cycle competition, Guo's final results were the best. The association awarded him a "Guande" flag as a special award in order to commemorate his skill.</p>

<h3>Swimming Tips</h3>
<p>— Qiu Shui</p>
<p>Swimming is still in its infancy in China today. A few years ago, the swimming pools in the Shanghai concessions were exclusively for foreigners. Among the universities, only those established by churches had swimming pools. There were no others known. Since the beginning of summer this year, the people of Shanghai seem to have a strong interest in swimming. Those who like to show off are taking this opportunity to display their skills. As a result, public swimming pools, where Chinese men and women have never set foot, are now crowded every day. It is gratifying to see that the people of our country are increasingly enthusiastic about sports. Therefore, I will describe the common knowledge about swimming below as a reference for those who love swimming.</p>
<p>Suitable Time for Swimming: Swimming is the best of all sports because practicing swimming requires the entire body to be active, which can make the body develop evenly. Moreover, swimming in water does not have a violent impact on the heart, and the skin can be thoroughly cleansed. Open-air swimming provides even more benefits from sunlight and air. However, swimming at the wrong time can cause more harm than good. Swimmers must know this. According to the best swimming time is in the morning or two hours after lunch. Swimming after meals is not conducive to digestion and is very unsuitable. Also, vigorous swimming at dawn is very beneficial to the body, but the benefits are not as great as in the afternoon because the sunlight is not yet present.</p>
<p>Suitable Locations for Swimming: It is easier for the human body to float in salt water, so beginners should practice on the beach first, except for specially prepared good swimming pools, and then go from shallow to deep. Then, no matter the water quality, you can swim freely. Beginners rely entirely on boldness, carefulness, and a sense of self-confidence. After entering the water, it is not advisable to be timid. After practicing for a long time, you will get used to it, and entering the water will not feel different. The most feared thing about swimming at the beach is that the wind and waves suddenly arrive. If you don't avoid them early, swimmers must not panic when encountering such accidents. You must quickly extend your face upwards, stretch your limbs, float on the water surface, and retreat towards the shore.</p>
<p>Prevention of Swimming Dangers: Cramps are the most dangerous thing that can happen while swimming. If a swimmer encounters such an accident, he must quickly get out of the water and give himself a vigorous massage. The cramps will then subside. Otherwise, he may suffer from total body paralysis and face the danger of drowning. Also, there should be at least one companion when swimming to prevent accidents. Do not boast of your skills and go alone. Also, you should wear suitable swimming clothes when swimming. Ordinary single clothes must not be used because you cannot move freely after entering the water. Also, if you are unlucky enough to see a small boat coming to rescue you, do not climb into the boat from the side. You should slowly enter the boat from the stern. Otherwise, the weight on one side of the boat will cause the small boat to sink.</p>
<h3>Hu Zijing is Not Dead</h3>
<p>— Chen Xingchu</p>
<p>The report on the 11th, as described by Mr. Fang Er, regarding the difficulty of Mr. Hu Zijing, the principal of Hunan University in Changsha and the principal of Mingde School, contains inaccuracies. Taking advantage of my free time, I will briefly describe one or two things for those who care about Mr. Hu. Yesterday, my friend came to Beijing from Changsha and talked about the situation in Hunan. I learned that Mr. Hu's residence was in Mingde School. On the night of the 27th, when he was about to go to bed, he suddenly heard a noisy sound followed by gunshots. He realized that something was wrong and went to the playground, then climbed over the wall and moved forward hesitantly. Although the searches were strict along the way, he was wearing short clothes in a hurry, and the communists suspected him of being a worker, so he was not detained. He temporarily took refuge at the home of a relative, Mr. Zhang. The next morning, the communists went to Mingde School with the intention of setting it on fire. The neighbors on the left and right were afraid of being affected and begged them repeatedly to avoid it. Later, they searched for Mr. Hu but did not find him. He has a long-standing reputation in Hunan for his achievements in running the school and his efforts to eliminate the Communist Party. Therefore, he had long been noticed by the Communist Party. Mr. Hu was afraid of revealing his whereabouts and suffering misfortune at Mr. Zhang's house, so he imitated Cao Aman's cutting off his beard to disguise himself. After eight days, he safely returned home. It was also heard that at the beginning of the recovery of Changsha, Mr. Tan Zu'an and Mr. Wang Rutang in Beijing sent telegrams to Chairman He Yunqiao to inquire about Mr. Hu's whereabouts, but they did not receive a reply. Mr. Hu sent a safe telegram to various dignitaries in Beijing yesterday.</p>

<p>In the past, there was a certain A who was addicted to opium. A young servant always waited on him. The young servant was in the habit of jumping around. A then ordered him to do somersaults in front of the bed for amusement. The young servant could fly and jump in a few feet of space, like a series of rings, and stop without panting or sweating. A was overjoyed and often called him to the bed to smoke a pipe as a reward. Over time, the young servant also became addicted. He could not enjoy it without doing somersaults first. This is because of habit. My friend Zhang Dihua has seen this. It is not a fabricated story.</p>
<p>A villager was fond of smoking dry tobacco. He bought thirty cash worth of tobacco every day for the pleasure of swallowing and exhaling. His wife was a frugal person and repeatedly advised him not to do so. In desperation, she secretly took a large piggy bank and threw in thirty cash every day, just like her husband's smoking expenses. At the end of the year, they were too poor to survive. The wife then took out the piggy bank and poured out her savings. Then, incense, candles, chicken, pork, fish, and wine were purchased in full. The wife then said to her husband, "Your smoking expenses may be small when calculated daily, but they become a huge amount over months and years. If you can quit, there will be no shortage." A was indeed moved. From the following year, he swore never to smoke again. At the end of the year, they were again too poor to survive. He consulted with his wife to take out the piggy bank and pour it out. His wife said, "If you don't smoke, why do I need a piggy bank? It has already been thrown away." In desperation, he could only borrow from the neighbors to barely survive the year. A was angry and said, "Quitting the habit is not as good as not quitting. At least there was a backup." From then on, he smoked as before, and the wife could do nothing about it.</p>
<h3>Rural Travel Notes</h3>
<p>— Sheng Sheng</p>
<p>China has a vast territory, and languages and customs vary within a hundred miles. I recently visited the areas near Xiashi, Xieqiao, and Wangdian to celebrate Mr. Zhang's birthday and to see the construction of a new house for my clan brother Shuo Fu's family. I will record what I saw and heard, as follows:</p>
<p>Emphasis on Sericulture: Sericulture is very important in western Zhejiang. Shuo Fu has many children and dislikes the noise and dust of the city, so he plans to start construction before the Mangzhong Festival. However, the elders in the village came out to object, saying that moving earth during the silkworm season would harm the silkworms. Shuo Fu followed the public opinion and changed the construction to between Xiaoshu and Dashu. Sheng Sheng said that this is indeed Shuo Fu's great virtue of being a good neighbor, and the local customs are simple and honest, unlike the self-governance in Shanghai's alleys.</p>
<p>Completion of the Roof Beam Ceremony: On the day of the raising of the roof beam, I went to observe. In advance, relatives and friends in the village competed to give sugar ingots as gifts. The ingots were about a foot long and made of white sugar and rice flour. When the auspicious time arrived, Shuo Fu's second son and his wife, dressed in beautiful clothes, each held one end of a colored silk. With a burst of firecrackers, sugar ingots flew down from above, all falling into the colored silk pockets. Then, there were congratulations, laughter, and the sound of craftsmen saying auspicious words. After burning incense and bowing again, the sugar ingots were distributed to the craftsmen, and a grand feast was set up for them. The guests also ate and drank. The roof beam ceremony was completed. Sheng Sheng said that the success of the house is a grand ceremony, and Shuo Fu's second son and his wife, with their youthful and beautiful appearance, smiled in the midst of the crowd, which was particularly beautiful.</p>
<p>The Lavishness of the Birthday Feast: Two days before Mr. Zhang's birthday, I had already arrived. At that time, I had already seen pigs, sheep, chickens, and fish filling the kitchen. Guests arrived at midnight, and the host tried his best to entertain them. The food and drink flowed like a stream. Guests came with their whole families, supporting the old and carrying the young, and the men and women gathered together in a lively manner. Their gifts were generally small silver coins of four or six dimes each. Eight dimes was unheard of. They drank and feasted for three days and nights. When they took their seats, there was no pretense of humility. When they put down their chopsticks, it was like silkworms eating leaves. When one seat was finished, the guests in the front seat did not leave until they were full. Before leaving, they wrapped up large and small packages, and even drained the juice from pig trotters and fish and stored them in bowls and tied them with handkerchiefs. Not to mention the cakes, dumplings, and fruits. It was truly a spectacle.</p>
<p>Where Does the Appropriateness Come From?: At noon on the day of the birthday, guests came like bees, owning the hall, bowing, taking their seats, and feasting. The host and his son guessed each other and could not name them, and their faces were not even familiar. There were not a few like this. Sheng Sheng said that the villagers' drinking is simple and unrefined, which is not surprising. However, I silently calculated for the host that although the dishes did not include seafood, the expense was probably even greater than in Shanghai. It is a pity that the fires of the world cannot be traveled and viewed everywhere. Please ask the authorities to set a reasonable standard, but it is difficult to say.</p>
<h3>Hamaguchi Cabinet's Austerity Policy and the Crisis of Japanese Agriculture</h3>
<p>— Ai Ai, sent from Japan</p>
<p>Japan was originally an agricultural country in East Asia. The total area of agricultural land in the country is about 6,060,000 cho, and the agricultural population is about 25 million. The annual harvest of agricultural products is about 60 million koku of rice and about 25 million koku of wheat. Other by-products are not included. Since the intrusion of capitalism into Japan, industry and commerce have flourished, and cities have become increasingly prosperous, while rural areas have gradually declined. Japanese industry and commerce have developed four to six times in the last fifteen years, but the agricultural situation has made no progress. After the Seiyukai, which claimed to represent the interests of the rural landlord class, stepped down, the Minseito, which represented the interests of the urban industrial and commercial bourgeoisie, continued to hold power. The stagnation of rural areas became more profound and widespread, and the grim life of farmers became more acute.</p>
<p>The biggest blow given to rural areas by the Hamaguchi Cabinet was the problem of the gold standard. Because the flat-rate gold standard caused the exchange rate to rise and the price of products to fall by 15% to 20% each year. The annual amount of Japanese agricultural products is about 3.3 billion yuan, so the reduction in income caused by the gold standard to farmers totals nearly 500 million yuan a year. The total amount of debt owed by Japanese farmers is about 5 billion yuan. The impact of the gold standard on the reduction of annual income is about 15%, so the increase in their debt burden is also 15%, for a total of 750 million yuan. Combining the aforementioned losses caused by the amount of agricultural products, which is about 500 million yuan, the impact of the Hamaguchi Cabinet's flat-rate gold standard on rural areas in the first year has reached a huge 1.25 billion yuan. Its austerity policy directly suppresses rural areas, no different from disguised destruction. For example, the fertilizer policy that had already been passed in the 56th session of the Diet was eliminated, and the various expenses of new agricultural and forestry projects were abolished. All of these indicate the government's weakness in neglecting agriculture.</p>
<p>Now, the economic decline of rural Japan is expanding and deepening. The number of farmers who desert is increasing daily. On the rural side, the actual rice harvest last year was 59,720,000 koku, which was a year of poor harvest, but the market price of rice, except for a slight increase at the beginning, fell sharply afterward. According to the survey of the Imperial Agricultural Association of Japan, the production cost of rice (excluding wages) is 33 yuan and 67 sen for owner-cultivators and 33 yuan and 84 sen for tenant farmers. However, the market price is only 27 yuan, with a loss of 6 yuan. In addition, the burden of micro-taxes such as rent and education fees is becoming more and more onerous. As a result, farmers are suffering too much and are turning to other places in hopes of transferring to factories to maintain their low standard of living.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the quality and quantity of land and climate in Japan cannot be called a country with natural conditions conducive to agriculture. However, in the past, the Japanese government adopted a policy of protecting agriculture and encouraging reclamation and intensive cultivation, so it was still able to achieve good results. However, the process of historical development, natural geographical conditions, and the reproduction of the rural population, even if the current government gives it active maintenance, may not be able to break through the crisis of agriculture. At a time when the need to solve the problems of population and food is extremely urgent and tense, and the situation in rural Japan has this tendency to reverse, this not only puts Japan itself in a difficult situation, but also has a significant impact on our country. Because its own supply is insufficient, it will inevitably use its neighbors as a source of food. The so-called overpopulation problem in Japan will become the center of international negotiations in the Pacific Ocean. The underlying meaning of the strings is not difficult to imagine its ambition.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (255)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Thirteen: Who Unintentionally Sows Fortune and Obtains a Diamond Ring? Only This Predestined Relationship Has the Heart to Sing a Golden Thread</p>
<p>In the end, the child could not be saved. Mrs. Zuo Shichen's grief goes without saying. The female doctor also said, "Don't be sad. You are young and will have more children in the future." Zuo Shichen also knew that the child's illness had started badly and that it would not be easy to cure. Even if he had asked a doctor earlier, he was afraid that it would not have helped. However, people generally believe that the earlier the treatment, the better the chance of saving the child. And Christianity always takes charity as its motto, and doctors take saving patients as their purpose. Because it was late at night, they were unwilling to help, and in the end, it felt like a regret. Mrs. Zuo Shichen was hit hard by the sudden death of her beloved son and spent her days in tears. Several relatives said that she would get sick if she continued like that, so it would be better to go out and relax. They took her to Suzhou. Men are not like women. After all, they are more optimistic on the outside. Mrs. was not at home, so he went back a little later, using it to drive away his sorrow and to attract him to a life of drinking and enjoying flowers. At this time, there were many emerging industries in Shanghai. Everyone was clamoring for industrial salvation, and the bourgeoisie wanted to invest in some industries. And people in the government also quite advocated it. Originally, countries that have no way to deal with finances always want to absorb the capital of merchants and civilians for the needs of enterprises. If it is handled properly, it is originally a very good thing. At this time, some people in Shanghai were building railways, some were running mines, some were running printing businesses, and some were doing business. There were various social events in the business world, and various social events in the business world. Various so-called tea parties, dances, etc. always had women present. Eastern customs, Japan always hired many geishas to sing and dance. China always made trouble by calling for a bureau and eating flower wine. At that time, Zuo Shichen's friends, such as Long Ziyun, Lin Fanzi, and Ling Zhixiang, were all working in the industrial world. They could not help but have some social events. Especially Ling Zhixiang, he was working as a comprador in a foreign company. That foreign company was famous for supplying mechanical materials to the whole world. The so-called industrial revitalization of the Chinese, except for local goods, if we talk about emerging industries, mechanical materials, etc., still have to rely on advanced countries in Europe and the United States. They do not yet have that power themselves. Therefore, those countries with a surplus of machinery and materials came to various countries in the East to seek their markets. The foreign company that Ling Zhixiang served was also doing this kind of business. Since they wanted to do business, they could not do without socializing. This is also the universal practice of all countries in the world. It seems that having women in the social scene adds a lot of interest. But China is a country of etiquette. At that time, the wives and misses were not as open-minded as later generations. A group of giant merchants and big buyers competed to go to the Qu Yuan. Even those blue-eyed and yellow-bearded people went to the Chinese brothels to practice their goodwill. Therefore, in the Shanghai halls, you often heard a sentence: Their business is good or not depends on whether the Shanghai market is good. Whether the Shanghai market is good is related to whether China's industry is flourishing.</p>

<h3>Large Numbers of Term Silver Dollars Collected in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Margin Prices Approach Two Fen, River Angles Rise Another Three Li</p>
<p>Market Overview Yesterday was the fifteenth day of the month, and various collections of term silver dollars by money houses should have been plentiful. The trading situation in the market was also quite frequent. Banks were actively purchasing silver dollars, which caused the margin price to suddenly rise, approaching the three-fen mark. People immediately became enthusiastic, but the trend of silver funds remained weak, with no signs of improvement. Yesterday, it actually declined. The situation of auxiliary coins was generally firm, and angle dollars were very strong. According to general speculation, there may be a continued increase.</p>
<p>Margin Discount Prices (Silver Dollar Margin) The opening price in the morning was 7 mace 2 fen 9 li 2 hao and a half, with no difference from the previous day's noon price. However, in the noon market, the margin price suddenly rose by 6 hao 2 and a half to 7 mace 2 fen 9 li 8 hao and 7 and a half, almost reaching a new record of three fen due to the particularly smooth purchasing by banks and a large amount of absorption. (Silver Discount) The trend was loose and soft, remaining the same as before. Both the morning and noon markets were uniformly 2 fen, which was significantly lower than the previous day. Added premium and the listed market price were both in a no-market situation.</p>
<p>Auxiliary Coin Market Situation Jiangnan small coins became increasingly tight. The opening price in the morning was 6 mace 4 fen 7 li, and the noon price rose another 2 li to 6 mace 4 fen 9 li. As a result, the price increased by 3 li compared to the previous day. 3,000 angle dollars were traded in the morning, and 7,000 angle dollars in the afternoon. Guangdong small coins The opening price in the morning was 6 mace 1 fen 9 li, and the noon price was 6 mace 1 fen 8 li 2 hao and a half, which was slightly lower than the previous day. 130,000 angle dollars were traded in the morning, and 70,000 angle dollars in the afternoon. Copper coins increased by 1,000 cash to 391,000 cash.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow (Silver Funds) Yesterday, the banks' collections seemed slightly higher than usual. Chinese merchants collected 2.67 million in bills of exchange, foreign merchants collected 2.23 million in bills of exchange, special collections were over 3 million, settlements were over 1 million, and various goods, exchange taxes, and miscellaneous collections reached over 10 million. Outflow from warehouses was 1.8 million. Japanese banks collected 4.5 million in various funds and outflow from warehouses was 500,000.

<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, spot trading in the bond market was scarce, while the futures market was quite active, with slightly strong buying and selling. Checking the changes in bond prices, due to the development of military affairs by the "Diaofang" (likely referring to a warlord faction) and optimistic views on the situation, investment buying was very active at one time, and bond prices soared. Among them, tariffs, troop reduction, and demobilization bonds opened in the morning and jumped high by about 1.5 yuan. Although the subsequent trend was firm, the trend was slightly flat. The buying sentiment in the afternoon session was particularly strong, and the rise was quite strong. As a result, only "Nine Six" remained unchanged, and the consecutive "Roll Six" only improved by 5-6 jiao. The "Cleanup" consecutive issues 2 and 5 each rose by 1 yuan and several jiao. The troop reduction for August rose by as much as 3 yuan and 4 jiao. Its September futures and tariff and troop reduction futures also rose by 2 yuan and 2 jiao. The bond market situation has changed compared to before. The total daily spot trading was only 4,400 yuan, and futures trading totaled 10.3 million.</p>
<p>Prices of different periods, either spot or futures, opening and closing prices, compared with the number of transactions on the previous day</p>

<h3>Yarn, Flower, and Yarn Markets Decline Daily</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn spot sales remain sluggish and unresponsive. All "gangs" (regional merchant groups) lack enthusiasm. This is due to the global cotton industry's weakness and domestic warfare, which greatly impacts demand. There is no activity along the Yangtze River. The Guangdong "gang," which was most active the previous day, is now also showing a despondent appearance. Moreover, most of the yarn previously purchased has been transferred to warehouses for storage and has not yet been shipped for export. It is said that Dalaishan Warehouse has 2,000 bales stored, and fellow traders have large quantities of futures absorbed, waiting for autumn sales. Domestic unrest and the weakness of international flower and yarn market conditions will lead to more severe future reactions. Therefore, some factories with long positions are showing intentions to sell off, but Guangdong "gang" and scattered longs are still intending to purchase. Ending with losing more than one or two silver.</p>
<p>The market opened with flat sentiment as American cotton showed instability. Some long positions were closed out, with each month falling by 1456 mace.

<h3>Cotton Market Plummets</h3>
<p>American Cotton Frequently Reaches Low Peaks, Recent Hanbiao Suddenly Drops Six Mace</p>
<p>The cotton market is trending downward, and the market situation is softening. This is because American cotton is falling, and October has already reached 1 jiao 2 fen 03. It has passed the low peak of the 15th year of the Republic. With a 10-pound sound test, the 1 jiao 2 fen barrier is likely to be broken. Therefore, some longs are showing unease and are eager to close out. Therefore, the market atmosphere was weak when the market opened in the morning. Later, Ningbo gang longs continued to increase their positions, and Gongtai also uniquely took in 9,000 dan. Ruida longs closed out 8,800 dan. Based on the world cotton market, it is still difficult to establish a price. The consumption of American cotton in August was greatly reduced. Therefore, some people believe that cotton may reach a price of 33 taels.</p>
<p>Hanbiao New Flower Breaks into the Four Tael Mark Hanbiao's market condition was quite weak when the market opened in the morning, and people were terrified. All months broke the four-tael mark. Later, Gongtai and Maoji covered their positions. As a result, each fell by 2 mace. Only the longs for the current month were difficult to support, falling by 4 mace alone. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere was still weak. The current month fell by another 2 mace, and the distant month fell by 1 mace. The total daily trading volume was 67,900 dan. List of buyers: Gongtai 9,200 dan, Maoji 4,900 dan, Shenchang 5,400 dan, Qinfeng He Shen Changfeng Yuanda Dafu Hengyi Daji Tongyu Tongxing took in 1,600 dan to 1,100 dan. List of sellers: Ruida 8,800 dan, Tianchang 3,200 dan, Yongfeng 2,700 dan, Hengda 2,000 dan, Yiyu Taixing Shenji Xincheng Xinheng Yuda 1,100 to 1,200 dan.

<p>Spot Demand is Dim and Lifeless Spot cotton trading is completely lifeless. Each factory is holding a wait-and-see attitude. The source is estimated to be 116 bales of Yaohua. The list of sales is on the left:</p>
<p>Shaanxi Flower 2400 Fengtian Factory took in 500 pieces. Factory shipments in December 10th and 12th Then 3500 pieces, then 500 pieces, then</p>
<h3>World Flower and Yarn Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>American Cotton Approaches the Two-Fen Mark Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to good news from Liverpool, but the market situation softened due to favorable forecasts in the West and mass sales. Futures fell by 11 to 15 pounds. Spot fell by 15 pounds. British cotton futures fell by 4 to 6 points. Spot fell by 15 points. Egyptian cotton spot remained unchanged. Indian cotton was stable due to purchases by brokers. Pingguoer and Aomula remained unchanged, Bailuoxi fell by 4 rupees, and forward remained unchanged.

<h3>Pessimistic Outlook for American Cotton</h3>
<p>Although the Weather is Dry, There are No Insect Pests, Expected Large Reduction in August Consumption</p>
<p>New York telegrams report that the progress of new cotton is mostly smooth. The loss from the drought is offset by the disappearance of boll weevils. Although there are not many sellers, there is a lack of demand. Retail trade remains sluggish. The public expects a large reduction in August consumption.</p>
<h3>Grain Prices in the River City Rice Market Increase</h3>
<p>The number of boats arriving at Luli yesterday in Zhabei slightly increased. The buying sentiment in Benjie is still active. The price of white japonica rice is gradually increasing. Although high-quality goods are still at 21 yuan, there is a strong momentum to break out of the customs. Ordinary medium-quality rice is also better by 2-3 jiao. Sub-standard japonica rice is also better by 1 jiao. Currently, the japonica rice situation is very good. Although the sales of thin indica rice are brisk, the number of arrivals is scarce, leading to no development. The Dongxin japonica rice factory has not sold from the beginning to the end. Therefore, the nominal price opens at 19.5 yuan, but in reality, there is no transaction. The source of new guest indica rice is gradually connecting. However, buyers are watching, and sellers are preventing sales from falling. Therefore, they are also selling. However, the sellers' intention is only to sell at 15 yuan. This is because the cost is relatively low. Therefore, it is not surprising that the market will open, but it must be half a yuan shorter than the previous disk. White yuan goods are scarce and sales are smooth, and prices are soaring. Currently, ordinary goods are already between 19.3-4 jiao. If there is a special top grade, it can be around 20 yuan.</p>
<p>The number of boats arriving at Hunan River City is 6-7. Market sales are acceptable. Changbang machinery japonica rice is seeing tight corners. Xu Su Tong white japonica rice is also rising by 1-2 jiao. The market situation changes with the gate. However, the source of the unified market is declining, so there are few transactions. Nanbang thin indica rice only has scattered arrivals. The market atmosphere is firm. Bianyuan sales are very active. There are occasional arrivals from the mainland. Therefore, the big disk is seeing an increase of 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Guest Transformation Very Dull</h3>
<p>The Guild Opened a Founding Meeting in the Afternoon and the Market was Closed</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market situation was very dull. Benjie was mainly watching. The unified market only had the mainland gang handling 500 bags of Saigon grade two at a price of 14.8 yuan in the morning and 300 bags of the next grade at a price of 12.4 yuan. There were no other transactions. In the afternoon, because the Miscellaneous Grains Industry Association held a founding meeting, the market was closed for one day, resulting in no transactions.</p>
<h3>The Reason for the Decline in Labeled Flour</h3>
<p>Many Bulls Sell Off, Gold Prices Plunge</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market generally showed an initial flat and then fatigued appearance for each month. Initially, the quoted price of foreign wheat rose by 2-3 jiao, and people's hearts calmed down. However, later, each disc fell because the foreign trade sentiment was not good, and they all sold back for the near and far periods. Therefore, the market has shown a downward trend. When the market closed in the afternoon, because the gold price fell by about 10 taels, those who were doing sentiment thought that if the gold price fell, the exchange rate would of course be extended, and there would be more opportunities to abandon the foreign wheat contract in the future. Therefore, the selling sentiment was very smooth, and the market situation tended to decline. However, the manufacturers who were doing long positions still saw an intake. I don't know who will see victory in the end. As a result, February 1980 fell by 1.5 fen, September fell by 1.25 fen, November fell by 2.25 fen, and December fell by 1.75 fen compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Term Wheat Sharply Falls by Five or Six Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the term wheat market showed an initial steady and then falling state. Because the quoted price of foreign wheat was slightly better during the initial disk, people's hearts were still stable. Soon, the factories' need for spot wheat was not very strong, causing the standard situation to be driven. When the market opened in the afternoon, because the flour market was already soft and the contract fee fell by about 10 taels, the longs were deeply afraid that the exchange rate would extend, and foreign wheat purchase orders could be approached. Therefore, a large number of returns were made, and the market fell sharply in each disc. However, this kind of scene is still a momentary impulse, and there will be problems in the subsequent steps. As a result, February 1980 fell by 6 fen, November fell by 5 fen, and December fell by 4 fen compared to the previous day. Because each factory鉴实销不动标准又跌之后均趋观望, the spot wheat fell again after the factories鉴实销不动标准又跌之后均趋观望. Therefore, the whole city did not open to do the cloud.</p>
<h3>The Price of North-South Goods and Orchid Bamboo Branches Rises Again</h3>
<p>Because the harvest of orchid bamboo branches this year is poor, the price of land has been rising repeatedly. The initial disc in Zhangzhou was only 245 yuan, but now it has risen to 29.5 yuan and 30 yuan. The number of sources arriving in the near future is scarce, and they are not even full of one hundred pieces. Therefore, the listed goods number disc is gradually tight. The market opened at 29 taels 3 qian yesterday, which is close to 1 tael higher than the previous market. If there are still no long positions in the later batches, the market price will inevitably rise again.</p>

<h3>Dutch East Indies Government Increases Chinese Immigration Tax</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese United Association Telegraphed National Government to Negotiate Promptly. Yesterday, the Overseas Chinese United Association of the Republic of China telegraphed the National Government, the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stating: It has been discovered that the Colonial Council of the Dutch East Indies previously discussed and resolved to increase the immigration tax for foreigners to 150 guilders per person, starting from July 1, 1929. In April of last year, Lin Youren, a citizen residing in Beijing, and others petitioned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered Zhang, the Consul-General stationed in Java, to make representations. At that time, the Dutch East Indies government, in view of the strong opposition from our country and the dissent from the local Overseas Chinese councilors, changed course and expressed that the original amount of 100 guilders per person would still be levied. Consul-General Zhang considered this satisfactory and publicly announced it in the newspaper. The Overseas Chinese were fortunate to hear that the diplomatic efforts had succeeded. Unexpectedly, in June of this year, the Dutch East Indies Colonial Council re-submitted the old case and resolved to increase the dock tax for immigrants from the Far East by 50 guilders to 150 guilders per person, starting in 1931. Specifying the Far East is tantamount to targeting the Chinese. The Chinese have a historical relationship with the Dutch East Indies as the former masters of Nanyang for thousands of years. Prior to the founding of the Republic, entry was free, and there was no such thing as a dock tax. After the 1911 Revolution, the Dutch, wary of the awakening of the Overseas Chinese, began to levy an immigration dock tax of 25 guilders per person to impose restrictions. Later, because the collection was smooth, it was increased to 50 guilders without protest. Now it has been increased to 100 guilders. Since the implementation of this tax, the Overseas Chinese have paid tens of millions. If the increase continues, not only will the leakage be even greater, but new arrivals will be afraid to come because the immigration tax in the Dutch East Indies is too high, and the businesses of old residents will lack successors and will gradually close down. The inherent position that has been painstakingly achieved over the past thousand years may also gradually decline and eventually disappear. We are even more concerned that other territories will see that the Overseas Chinese are easy to bully and that China is easy to deal with, and will imitate the Dutch East Indies government's new closed-door policy of imposing restrictions through taxation, and will compete to levy immigration taxes on the Overseas Chinese. In this vast world, there will be no place for the Overseas Chinese to stand. Thinking of the future, we cannot help but feel terrified. Therefore, we request your government to consider the patriotic and party-loving Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, and order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to promptly protest to the Dutch government and the Dutch East Indies government. At the same time, notify the Dutch envoy stationed in China to promptly telegraph the Dutch government, instructing the Dutch envoy stationed in the Netherlands to promptly make representations to the Dutch government to cancel the Colonial Council's resolution on the increase in revenue, which originally stipulated a dock tax of 100 guilders, and to require immigrants from the Far East to pay a dock tax of 150 guilders starting in 1931. And declare that if the Dutch East Indies government does not cancel this resolution, China will also levy a special tax on Dutch people coming to China and will not enjoy the most-favored-nation treatment enjoyed by countries that do not levy immigration taxes on the Overseas Chinese. This matter is urgent, and we urge your government to promptly order the matter to be handled as soon as possible in order to seize the opportunity and comfort the hopes of the Overseas Chinese. We await your orders with utmost urgency. Overseas Chinese United Association.</p>
<h3>Jinliyuan Wharf Case</h3>
<p>Recovery Not Executed Yesterday</p>
<p>The Jinliyuan Wharf dispute between the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the French Catholic Church of the Three Virtues has been reported previously. The following is a summary of yesterday's news. The Employees' Union's Position: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Employees' Union's open letter to compatriots nationwide stated: The French imperialist Mixed Court has brazenly sided with its tool, the French Catholic Church of the Three Virtues, to destroy the Jinliyuan Wharf, the last remaining asset of our China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Isn't the Jinliyuan Wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the wharf where the Wenzhou route ships dock, universally acknowledged to belong to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company? Who would have known that when it had just become a beach at the end of the Tongzhi era and the beginning of the Guangxu era of the Qing Dynasty, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company spent more than 600,000 taels of silver to fill it in and make it a good piece of land because it needed a place for ships to dock. At that time, it was indeed the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's. Later, in the seventh year of Guangxu, the Shanghai Daotai and the Shanghai County government measured the newly formed beach. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company followed the official business of the Daotai and county government and reported to the county to apply for taxation. The county surveyed and measured it clearly and gave the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company a taxation certificate. At that time, it was even more certainly the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's. Later, because the French Catholic Church had some Three Virtues there who bought a piece of land there and insisted that this piece of land that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had filled in themselves and already reported for taxation should be reported for taxation by the Three Virtues according to the example of mother and child intergeneration. Their consul and minister helped him and went to the Prime Minister's Office, which was in charge of foreign affairs at the time, and the ministers of the North and South Seas to repeatedly complain that they must revoke the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's taxation certificate. At first, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company naturally argued strongly with its own government offices. The government offices handling this case also knew that the French minister, etc., were protecting his parishioners and that it was completely inconsistent with international law and human sentiment, and argued with him several times. Unexpectedly, the Sino-French War broke out, and our country was defeated. The French imperialist forces were overwhelming, and there was no way to talk about international law and human sentiment with you. Fortunately, the authorities of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company at that time were quite good at what they did. They had already obtained a taxation certificate for many years. Although they gave up in a shameful foreign diplomacy and revoked the certificate based on the four characters of "peace and harmony," they still exchanged it for a sentence from the French minister that there was no obstruction to the Jinliyuan Wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. In the winter of the sixteenth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, under this failed diplomatic situation, a 25-year lease agreement was signed with the French Catholic Church of the Three Virtues as an exchange condition, and it could be extended upon expiration. In the winter of the fifth year of the Republic of China, when the lease was about to be extended, their European war was in full swing. We did not take advantage of their difficulties to add any harsh conditions, but still made a friendly agreement with them to renew the lease for another 25 years, which could still be extended upon expiration. Last year, the government used troops, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's ships were requisitioned to transport troops, and the operating income naturally decreased greatly. The contract stipulated that the payment date was normally paid quarterly in advance according to the Shanghai customs. Moreover, renting land to build houses is allowed for two years according to civil law, especially at this special time. According to the contract, the winter rent should have been paid on October 1st. According to Shanghai customs, it is very common and common to pay it by December 31st. Who knew that on October 24th, the final notice from the Three Virtues was received, limiting the rent to be paid by the end of October. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company knew that they had bad intentions and immediately went everywhere to raise money. By the end of October, they had only managed to raise part of the money and hurriedly handed it over, thinking that they would always talk about the friendship between the landlord and the guest for many years. Unexpectedly, after receiving part of the rent, he turned his face and said that the contract was cancelled immediately. Poor China Merchants Steam Navigation Company heard this sentence as if it were a bolt from the blue, because the source of this contract had a shameful and painful history in foreign diplomacy. Moreover, although the leased wharf in this contract only had the status of half a ship, if this contract was really cancelled, the entire Jinliyuan Wharf would be incomplete if a piece was taken out in the middle. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's shipping industry would almost be completely destroyed by him. He had no choice but to endure this breath and try his best to raise money again. By November 4th, the entire rent was barely raised, and the interest for late payment was added and quickly delivered, thinking that the Three Virtues would always change their mind. Unexpectedly, the Three Virtues became determined and showed the true face of his imperialist tool, and went to his imperialist Mixed Court to request an emergency disposition to order us to move out. Our China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had to accommodate the fact that the Mixed Court in the French Concession, a product of these unequal treaties that have not yet been abolished, still exists temporarily, so we hired a lawyer to file a defense, asking him to refute the plaintiff's complaint and to submit it to public judgment according to the contract first. Who knew that they, the imperialists, were all connected and the court's judgment did not adopt our position and approved the Three Virtues' request to cancel the lease. Later, our China Merchants Steam Navigation Company requested a review, and he upheld the original judgment. Alas, isn't it that they, the imperialists, are all connected, taking advantage of the danger and safely overturning the previous words of their envoys that there was no obstruction to the Jinliyuan Wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company? Why do they not talk about customs, ignore the contract, and disregard the precedents and do such reckless things? Now that we know that they harbor evil intentions and are taking advantage of this opportunity to destroy our country's only shipping industry, we want to ask the authorities of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company not to ask for some judicial relief from the French Mixed Court, which the whole country does not recognize, and humiliate themselves according to the document submitted to the Ministry of Communications. It is simply possible to request the government to return the revoked taxation certificate and restore our status as landlords based on the history of this wharf rental, because they have overturned the words of their previous envoys, so the exchange conditions for revoking the taxation certificate and changing it to leasing the wharf are of course overturned together. Moreover, the foreign policy of our party is to abolish unequal treaties sooner or later, and the abolition of concessions and the Mixed Court will be no problem. Let's see how long the imperialists will have their last glory. Hereby declare that all compatriots across the country should unite and respond to us with our slogans written below: [T13]1[/T] Abolish unequal treaties; [T13]2[/T] Recover concessions; [T13]3[/T] Immediately abolish the French Mixed Court; [T13]4[/T] Request the government to return the revoked taxation certificate and restore our China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's status as landlord of the Jinliyuan Wharf; [T13]5[/T] Support the country's only shipping rights.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai's Talk: Yesterday, a reporter from the China East News Agency visited Mr. Cai, and Mr. Cai said that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will do its best to negotiate the Jinliyuan Wharf case and will never allow it to fail. The French Mixed Court's biased judgment at this time when the recovery of French rights is near, the judgment of this deformed organization, the French Mixed Court, can be ignored. In addition to telegraphing the government to negotiate, Mr. Ma Xiangbo, Mr. Lu Bohong, and others are acting as mediators to advise the church to maintain Sino-French friendship and not to cause bad feelings. Regarding legal matters, the French Mixed Court may be asked to review the case again in order to continue the validity of the lease and maintain the lifeline of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, etc.</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Negotiations: The Bureau submitted to the Ministry of Communications requesting that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs be consulted immediately to promptly advise the French consul to fulfill the previous promises of the French envoys and prevent the court from executing the judgment and take into account international friendship. Yesterday, Mr. Cai received a telegram from a director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs saying that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had ordered the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to do its best to negotiate with the French consul, etc.</p>
<p>French Consul's Statement: Yesterday afternoon, Liu Yunfang, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, visited French Consul General Gange Lin. According to Gange Lin, this is only a small problem that can be easily resolved, and there is no problem with the judgment made by the French Mixed Court, etc.</p>
<p>Recovery Not Executed Yesterday: Yesterday was the date for the execution of the cancellation of the lease, but the Three Virtues side did not go to execute the recovery until the end.</p>
<h3>Cai Pei Reorganizes the Affairs of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company After Resuming His Position</h3>
<p>Personnel Appointed: Wang Zixuan, the chief of the affairs section of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which was established during the internal reorganization in July, was originally the chief of the business section. Since Zhao Tieqiao was assassinated, Wang has been on leave for more than a week and has not come to the bureau. Yesterday, Cai Pei approved and ordered Zhou Shian from the secretariat to temporarily replace Wang as the chief of the affairs section. In addition, Hong Yanbin, the chief of the accounting section, submitted his resignation. Cai has approved the retention and temporarily appointed Zhong Zushu to temporarily replace him. In addition, due to the large number of foreign affairs in the bureau, a legal advisor was specially hired to be stationed in the bureau.</p>
<p>Bureau Affairs Meeting: Yesterday, Mr. Cai specially issued a notice to all departments and offices, stating that from today, at 5:00 PM every day, the Secretary-General will invite the heads of each department and office in the bureau to go to the Director-General's office for a discussion meeting to discuss the progress of each department and office and the reorganization plan of the bureau affairs. This matter has been implemented since yesterday.</p>
<p>Resumption of Ship Operations: After the bureau requested the Ministry of Communications to release the ships along the Yangtze River, six ships have resumed operations. Among the ships currently operating on the coastal route, there are three Ningbo-Wenzhou route ships, one each for the North and South Seas routes, and one Fuzhou route ship. Yesterday, it was agreed with the Ministry of Communications to release the Xinming ship back to the Tianjin route. The bureau has a total of thirteen Jianghai ships that can be navigated.</p>
<h3>Various Shipping Companies Raise Water Freight and Warehouse Rent</h3>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Fresh Goods Increase in Price: Taikoo, China Merchants, Sanbei, Ningshao, and other shipping companies in Shanghai have recently increased the prices of materials used by various ships and increased expenses. The four companies have agreed to increase the water freight for fresh goods along the Shanghai-Ningbo route from the 15th of this month. The new water freight prices for each cargo are set as follows: (A) Fresh Bucket: Large bucket 1 yuan, large side bucket 1 yuan, small bucket cut bucket 6 jiao, small small bucket 4 jiao, side bucket long bucket number bucket middle bucket round bucket tangerine bucket another bucket small side each 6 jiao, salted bucket 2 yuan, Mao clams bucket 1 yuan, jellyfish bucket iced fresh bucket each 1 yuan for salted goods, empty bucket 2 jiao.

Yesterday, all the fresh goods were notified to the customers.</p>
<p>Increase in Warehouse Rent for Gunny Bags: Among the warehouse rents of Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Nissin, and China Merchants, the storage of gunny bags has always been the most transported to the various ports of the Yangtze River and the Northern Seas. Recently, since the Jianghai Customs issued an order prohibiting the export of rice, the use of gunny bags has decreased day by day, and the amount stored in the warehouse has increased day by day. As a result of the meeting of the four companies, the warehouse rent has been increased. In the past, each gunny bag occupied 33 square feet, weighed about 650 pounds, and the monthly rent was 1.5 qian. Now it has been changed to 2 fen per square foot for the first month, and 1 fen per foot per day thereafter. Compared with the original price, it has increased by more than 50%.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government to Organize Committee to Review Rental Disputes</h3>

<h3>Mandatory Closure and Pay for the May Fifth Revolution Memorial Day</h3>

<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Kuomintang of China and the Public Training Committee yesterday published a notice (No. 28) to all people's organizations in the city, stating that they had received the Central Executive Committee's notice No. 12028, which stated that the Secretariat had submitted a document based on the National Government's Fourth Civil Affairs Document No. 4462, which was a letter from the National Government forwarding a document from the Executive Yuan based on a document from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce regarding whether all factories and shops should be closed and paid on May 5th, which was designated by the Central Government as a memorial day, and requesting approval.

<h3>Lingering Echoes of the French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Strike</h3>
<p>Although the French Concession water and electricity workers' strike has been completely resolved, the various conditions proposed by the union and the July 21st tragedy still need to be negotiated and resolved. Therefore, the union's internal work has been tense recently. The news is compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Dismissal of Workers: During this resumption of work, the factory suddenly dismissed three more workers. All the workers were extremely indignant at once, thinking that the factory's first step in fulfilling the procedures had changed the original agreement. Therefore, they requested Mr. Du Yuesheng, the factory representative, to negotiate reasonably. It is now learned that there was a slight misunderstanding between the two parties. The factory did not refuse the three workers' jobs, but rather the factory's positions were already full. Once the new workers left, they could re-enter the factory. After hearing the above news, the union had no other objections.</p>
<p>New Workers Issue: According to statistics, the factory previously recruited more than 400 new workers, of which about 80 were White Russian workers. Although most of them have now left their jobs, there are still more than 30 White Russian new workers and many Chinese new workers working in the factory. It is said that the company has decided to send these new workers away within a few days and will not cause any problems because of it.</p>
<p>Continued Payment of Wages: All wages during the strike are currently being calculated by the company department by department, and it is still difficult to complete the calculation in a short period of time. If a certain department has completed the calculation, the company will send someone to pay Mr. Du Yuesheng, who will then forward it to the union for individual distribution. Starting at 2:00 PM yesterday, the wages of the workers in the mechanical departments were continued to be distributed. As for the wages of the new workers, they are scheduled to be distributed by the factory itself at 8:00 AM today.</p>
<p>Tram Conditions: Yesterday, all trams have resumed their original operating status. However, there are still about 20 trams in the factory that have not been repaired. They should be completed in two or three days. Yesterday, the company opened a new bus route, which runs from the Great World to Xieqiao.</p>
<p>Company Losses: It is difficult to estimate the exact losses suffered by the company since the strike. According to a survey yesterday, the losses amounted to about 1.5 million Chinese dollars. The company's daily tram revenue is about 5,000 yuan. Since this revenue is now lost, the salaries of employees still have to be paid. Other unfortunate events, such as sudden power outages and water pipe bursts, have also resulted in losses of tens of thousands of dollars. Therefore, the total of 1.5 million is probably more than that.</p>
<p>Tragedy Issue: The French authorities prioritized resolving the strike. There have been no results regarding the tragedy. The National Government instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to handle this matter, but the Ministry has not yet made any progress. However, all efforts are still being made. It is said that more than 20 workers have been released from the police station, but the injuries of seven of them have not yet healed. Therefore, the union has stated that it will never give up until the tragedy issue achieves the goal of punishing the murderers and apologizing.</p>
<h3>Problem of Tea Room Extortion of Liquor Fees</h3>
<p>Statement by the Shanghai-Ningbo Steamboat Tea Room Union</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo Steamboat Tea Room Union made a statement regarding the recent municipal government's investigation and ban on tea rooms extorting liquor fees. Yesterday, it submitted a document to the Executive Committee and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, which read (excerpted above): "We have read in the newspaper that the Sixth District Party Department of this city has reported that Ning Shao, a company of the Beizhao Merchants, allows the tea rooms on the Shanghai-Ningbo line to extort liquor fees and harass passengers, and has submitted it to your committee for referral to the municipal government for investigation and prohibition." We believe that this case involves the scope of our union and we have no choice but to clarify to your committee (bureau).</p>
<p>The extortion of liquor fees by tea rooms is caused by the exploitation of the compradors. Tea rooms have no salaries for working on the ship, and their livelihood depends solely on the liquor fees given by passengers. Now that the compradors do not pay wages, they also charge meal fees and create additional fees to share the tea rooms' liquor fees (i.e., the compradors must extract a certain amount for each guest served by the tea room). Under this harsh exploitation, in order to maintain their livelihood, tea rooms have no choice but to extort more liquor fees to supplement their income.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the union's organization, in order to break this bad practice, it negotiated and canceled the additional fees and meal fees of the Xin Ning Shao and Xin Jiang Tian ships, reducing the burden on workers. At the same time, it severely cracked down on the extortion of all members. In the past, members such as Xu Shiwei and Leng Awu of Xin Ning Shao, and Dong Fulai of Xin Jiang Tian, ​​were all punished by the union for this suspicion. The facts are all there and can be reviewed.</p>
<p>However, the Ning Xing ship is more difficult to implement due to special circumstances. Each tea room on the ship must pay a huge amount of cash as a deposit, such as 400 taels of silver for each tea room in the third-class cabins, 500 taels for the second-class cabins, and 600 taels for the first-class cabins. At the same time, there are also additional fees. Each tea room in the third-class cabins must pay 10 cents per guest, 60 cents per guest in the second-class cabins, and 80 cents per guest in the first-class cabins. In addition, they also charge tea rooms 10 cents per month for meal fees. Moreover, all supplies for entertaining passengers must be purchased by the tea rooms themselves. Under these circumstances, the suffering of the workers' lives can be imagined. Therefore, extorting more liquor fees is inevitable. Although the union has repeatedly negotiated, it has not been effective, so the union is unable to rectify and crack down on it. The ship's owner also allows it and does not care. This is why the extortion of liquor fees occurs from time to time.</p>
<p>The union is in the situation and understands the crux of the problem. It will explain the details in detail and ask for review. It also urges the Sanbei Company to cancel all kinds of additional fees and return the workers' deposits, so that the workers can reduce their burden, so that the extortion of liquor fees can be strictly investigated and prohibited. The passengers are fortunate, and the workers are fortunate. Respectfully submitted.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Move to Add Double Tracks to the Beijing-Shanghai Railway</h3>
<p>Planning to Start with Shanghai-Suzhou Section</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, in view of the large number of passengers traveling on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and in order to develop freight transportation, once proposed a plan to lay double tracks. However, due to various obstacles over the years, it has not been implemented. It is now learned that the railway's business situation in recent years has increased significantly compared to previous years. Therefore, it is planned to first lay double tracks between Suzhou and Shanghai. It is currently being prepared. Once everything is ready, construction will begin. If the results are perfect, double tracks will be laid between Beijing and Suzhou.</p>
<h3>Maritime News</h3>
<p>Dazhong Towing and Rescue: After the Dazhong ship of Heng'an Company ran aground off Fuzhou, it was entrusted to the South Manchuria Company for towing. Because the Dazhong ship's hull was stuck in the reef, the South Manchuria Shipyard was unable to rescue it. The company then entrusted Mitsui &amp; Co. in this port to act as an agent. The Tokyo Salvage Company sent technicians to salvage it. According to the inspection results of the Tokyo Salvage technicians, the Dazhong can be towed up. Now they will lead all the technicians to the scene of the accident.</p>
<p>Security Team Comes to Shanghai: The First Battalion of the Third Regiment of the Wenzhou Security Team was ordered to be transferred to Shanghai. Yesterday, there was a telegram to Shanghai stating that the First Battalion of the regiment was carrying full arms and taking the Hai'an ship of the China Merchants Bureau to Shen. It is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today. A special telegram was sent to the Shanghai Bureau to arrange a pier for the armed team to land.</p>
<h3>Negotiation of Telephone Fees for the Chinese Concession Telephone Bureau</h3>
<p>Since 1926, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau's long-distance telephone office has established rules with the China Foreign German Telephone Company. If users rent, they must pay an additional five cents for each call compared to the local bureau, and three times the fee for urgent calls, which is one dime and five cents. Users in the concession are charged a handling fee of five cents for each call by the China Foreign Company, and one dime and five cents for urgent calls. At the end of each month, the China Foreign Company collects all the fees and sends them to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau. Recently, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau found that the money turned in by the China Foreign Company over the years was calculated based on the number of ordinary calls, and there were no urgent call fees. The loss was more than 10,000 yuan. The bureau has now sent someone to negotiate with the China Foreign Telephone Company, but the China Foreign Company has not yet made any substantial response. It is said that if the Shanghai Telephone Bureau cannot resolve the matter, it will submit it to the Ministry for negotiation.</p>
<h3>Problem of Making a Certificate of Dishonor for Negotiable Instruments</h3>
<p>Should Await Clear Instructions from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied to Lawyer Mu Ansu yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, On the 14th of this month, we received your letter stating that on April 29th of this year, your firm sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce regarding the matter of making a certificate of dishonor for negotiable instruments, but has not yet received a reply. We are now sending a copy of the previous letter to request a reply." According to Article 103 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, the organ for making a certificate of dishonor is not limited to the Chamber of Commerce. The Bankers Association also has the authority to handle this matter. We sent a letter to the Bankers Association to seek their opinion in order to handle the matter. Then, on May 12th, we received a letter from the association stating that although the Negotiable Instruments Law stipulates that the Bankers Association can also make a certificate of dishonor for negotiable instruments, there is no basis for all procedures and document formats. We have asked the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for clear instructions, but have not yet received a reply. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce has not yet made a definite decision on this matter, so we have not replied immediately. We are now sending a letter to inquire again with the Bankers Association whether there is any reply from the Ministry. We are sending this letter for your reference."</p>

<h3>Important Political Affairs Undertaken by Shanghai County</h3>
<p>Since Yan Shenyu took office as the Shanghai County Magistrate, he has been actively carrying out various matters related to the local area that should be done and should be reformed. The various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Progressing with the Construction of Huibao Bridge on the Songjiang County Road: Huibao Bridge is an important transportation hub between the two counties. After the Director of the Construction Bureau of this county, together with the Director of the Construction Bureau of Songjiang County, inspected the area, they both agreed that the construction of the bridge must use cement and steel to maintain its permanence, which is also the view of the local people. Now, Wu, the Director of the Construction Bureau of this county, believes that the roadbed of the Beihui Road in the county has been completed and is about to be constructed. Therefore, he has submitted a request to the Construction Department to issue standard drawings of a 12-meter bridge to facilitate planning and budgeting so that construction can begin as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Raising Funds for Dredging Yu Tang: Dredging Yu Tang River is currently being actively carried out. The Construction Bureau has sent personnel to complete the survey. The preparatory meeting decided that all dredging funds would be collected from the land. The Chairman of the committee submitted the proposal to the county for review and approval. Yan, the County Magistrate, believed that the land collection in this county had exceeded the prescribed limit and should not be collected again. He ordered the committee to find other ways to raise funds locally.</p>
<p>Urging the Handling of Personnel Registration: The case of handling personnel registration has been repeatedly urged by each district to speed up the handling. The Third District Chief Meeting also resolved to limit each district to start handling it within June. However, some districts have reported to the county that the household census has not yet been completed, so few reports have been submitted to the county. Now, the government has again received an order from the department urging strict compliance. Therefore, Yan, the County Magistrate, has instructed each district chief to quickly list the handling situation and report it, and ordered that reports be submitted monthly for review. The matter is related to important political affairs and should not be delayed in any way.</p>
<p>Appointing a Member of the Financial Management Committee: Yang Deqi, the original member of the Financial Management Committee of this county, died of illness and left a vacancy. The committee has reported to the county for another appointment. Now, Yan, the County Magistrate, has sent a letter to Ding Renke, a local gentry, to fill Yang's vacancy. In addition to urging him to attend the meeting and take office as soon as possible, he has also sent letters to the Finance Bureau and the County Finance Bureau to inform them.</p>

<h3>Wang Buyun, Kidnapped by Water Police and Bandits Outside Wusong Estuary, Escapes Danger</h3>
<p>Wang Buyun and his son, residents of Dingxing Sand and Shitou Sand outside the Wusong Estuary, and Shi Shangzhi and other five people were previously stationed in the 17th team of the 4th District of the Wusong Water Police. Chen Guoliang, the squad leader of Ruifeng Sand, and police officers Wang Youcai and Zhang Liujin colluded with bandits to kidnap them and extort huge sums of money. The details have been reported in this newspaper repeatedly.</p>
<p>It is now learned that Wang Buyun's family received a letter from the bandits saying that Wang and his son needed to prepare 20,000 yuan to be redeemed. However, Wang's family has no savings and the total value of the family property is less than 20,000 yuan. They had to let it take its course. Unexpectedly, Wang Buyun suddenly returned home safely early in the morning the other day.</p>
<p>According to him, after being kidnapped, he was confined in a small sailboat and sailed straight to the Lusi beach and anchored. Along the way, the bandits questioned Wang and the other five hostages about their family situation and property, and forced them to write letters to their families to prepare ransom and set deadlines for redemption. At about 11:00 PM the night before last, one of the bandits guarding Wang Buyun fell asleep drunk at the table. Wang took the opportunity to escape from the cabin and jumped ashore. The bandits discovered it and chased after him, but it was too late. Wang managed to escape. However, his son and Shi Shangzhi and the other four hostages were still on the bandit ship because there was no chance to escape. Wang had been imprisoned on the bandit ship for more than 20 days, so he felt quite uncomfortable. After returning home, he went to another place to recuperate.</p>
<p>Qiu Mingjiu, the Magistrate of Baoshan County, believes that Dingxing and Shitou Sands are under the jurisdiction of the county and are also the patrol area of ​​the 4th District of the Water Police. Therefore, he has consulted with Han, the District Chief of the 4th District, to send warships to arrest the bandits and investigate the case. At the same time, he reported the situation to the Suzhou High Court and ordered the arrest of Chen Guoliang and others and set up a plan to rescue the hostages.</p>
<h3>Detective Accuses Deyilou Out of Anger</h3>
<p>Framing Someone for Selling Wine After Failing to Eat for Free; Honest Judge Orders Witness to be Summoned</p>
<p>Gao Zhichang and Wang Menglou, Chinese detectives of the Harbin Police Station, were assigned to guard the Zhoujiazui Road station. On the 7th of this month, they suddenly pointed out that the Deyilou noodle restaurant at No. 3330 of the address was also selling beer. According to the regulations of the Engineering Bureau, a license must be donated to sell wine, otherwise it will be considered a violation of the rules. The detective reported to the Western detective, and the next morning, he summoned Tang Ahu, the owner of Deyilou, to the Special District Court to accuse him of violating the business rules. After Judge Shen interrogated him, Tang firmly denied that he had sold alcohol, and there were many doubts in the testimony of the two detectives. Shen then adjourned the case and ordered the detective to investigate in detail. After sending detectives to search the noodle restaurant and Tang's home, they found not only no beer, but also no empty bottles. After inquiring from all parties, they learned that Gao and Wang Western detectives had framed him out of hatred.</p>
<p>On the 6th of this month, Gao and Wang went to Deyilou to eat their fill. The bill was 1 dime and 9 cents. They wanted to eat for free, but Tang Ahu, the owner of the restaurant, believed that he was a small business and could not afford to lose money. He refused to give up and insisted on being paid. The two detectives threw the money away because Tang did not care about their feelings and were very unhappy. They then thought of revenge. The next night, a waiter named Xue, a Ningbo native, from the Jinming Zilin Western Newspaper, suddenly bought two bottles of beer from Deyilou. Xue did not know that there was another intention. He went with the money. The person in charge of the noodle restaurant told him that the house did not sell wine. Xue was afraid that it would be difficult to report back empty-handed, so he went to the Overseas Chinese Hotel on Xinji浜 Road nearby to buy two bottles and brought them back. Just as he reached the entrance of Zhoujiazui Road, the two detectives were already waiting there. They asked Xue whether the wine was bought from Deyilou. Xue told him that they did not sell it there and he had bought it from the Overseas Chinese Hotel. The detective immediately invited Xue to a secluded place to discuss secretly for a long time and still asked Xue to take the wine to Deyilou. He forcibly said that Xue's wine was sold by Deyilou, who was selling wine without a license in violation of the regulations. Without saying anything, he took Tang to the Harbin Police Station.</p>
<p>Tang was framed, but fortunately the judge was honest and found out the doubts and ordered the detective to investigate strictly. Then the truth came out. The case against Tang has now been dismissed, and the two detectives Gao and Wang were also taken to court by the Engineering Bureau yesterday morning to file a lawsuit. The witnesses Tang Ahu and Xue and others were summoned. The defendant hired lawyer Yan Gang to defend him. After Judge Feng opened the trial, Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer for the police station, stated the course of the case, followed by each witness stating the facts one by one. Judge Feng believed that there were still two important witnesses who needed to be summoned and ordered the two defendants Gao and Wang to be detained and adjourned the trial to next Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Works Bureau Approves Water Fee Collection Method for Vegetable Stalls</h3>
<p>There are formal vegetable markets for selling vegetables in Zhabei. Each market is equipped with a total water meter that is managed by the vegetable market. The monthly water price is calculated according to the meter. All water used by each stall is supplied by the vegetable market, and the water fee to be paid is also collected by the vegetable market from each stall. The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company does not ask about it. The Nanshi area is vast and there is only one formal vegetable market in Tangjiawan. The remaining ten or so places such as Nine Mu Di, Sanjiaojie, Xian Gua Jie, and Old County Front are all stalls along the street and have no affiliation. In the past, the water used by Nine Mu Di was contracted by someone to collect water fees on behalf of the company, and the company issued receipts. Later, each vegetable stall followed the example. The Municipal Public Works Bureau believed that the above water use situation was not in the company's business charter, and the fee collection method had never been stipulated. Moreover, the contract water system was abolished in the revised business charter last year, and water meters were universally installed. If the water used by vegetable stalls still follows the contract water system and is contracted repeatedly, it is contrary to the regulations. Therefore, the company ordered the local water company to properly plan a universal water fee collection method for compliance. The company then discussed and replied and forwarded it to the municipal government for approval as a collection of four copper coins for each load of water delivered to each household, and two coins for half a load. Those who pick it up themselves will have one copper coin deducted per load. Stalls that want to pay monthly according to the daily water consumption are allowed to do so voluntarily. Because this water price includes labor costs such as management, faucet delivery, and water materials, it is slightly higher than the ordinary price.</p>
<h3>Lu Sheng Swimming Pool Will Be Temporarily Closed</h3>
<p>Open at 8:00 AM Wednesday Morning</p>
<p>The Engineering Bureau announced that the open-air swimming pool will be temporarily closed at 8:00 PM next Monday evening and will be reopened at 8:00 AM on Wednesday morning. This is hereby announced. August 15, 1930, Edward, General Manager.</p>
<h3>Follow-up News on the Tragic Death of Lu Lianqiao, Clerk of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>The Perpetrator is an American Named Yuan Ludeng; Preliminary Negotiations are Underway</p>
<p>Lu Lianqiao, a clerk of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, was on his way through the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shilu on the 7th of this month when he was hit by car No. 11578 driven by the Westerner Di Hamowei, which was speeding from the west without honking the horn. Lu was unable to avoid it and was hit in front of the car and then hit behind the car, seriously injuring him and causing his death. His family, through the introduction of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, hired lawyer Wang Zuxun to act as an agent to discuss the proceedings. It is now learned that the issue of the nationality of the Western perpetrator was investigated by lawyer Wang Zuxun and Yan Wanzhi, a translator of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, at the French Concession Vehicle Affairs Office. It was found that the Westerner was of American nationality and his driver's license number was 1519. He now works at No. 141 Sichuan Road. His wife is Russian and lives at No. 2, No. 445 Lafayette Road. After checking with the American Consulate again, it was confirmed that he was indeed an American citizen. Lawyer Wang believed that since the defendant was an American, if the victim's family sued in the Special District Court according to law, the result would not be good. The defendant would definitely not be willing to be subject to the sanctions of our country's laws. Once a lawsuit is filed, it would hinder other methods of resolution. Therefore, he went to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss with committee members Wang Xiaolai, Yuan Ludeng, Fang Jiaobo, etc. The result was to notify Lu's family to suspend the lawsuit and decide to proceed with diplomatic procedures. Yuan Ludeng, the Chinese director, will first inquire about the solution from the defendant's side in his private capacity. Yesterday, lawyer Wang sent a letter to notify Lu's family, informing them of the progress and asking them to wait quietly for a solution.</p>
<h3>Sudden Death from Small Intestine Hernia</h3>
<p>Resembling a Merchant; Two Checks Beside Him</p>
<p>At 5:20 yesterday morning, a person who looked like a businessman collapsed at the corner of Zhejiang Road and Hankou Road. The nearby patrolmen found him and saw that he had been dead for a long time. They reported to the detective chief and sent detectives to check the body. They found a paper bag in his pocket with two checks for a large amount. In addition, there were seven 5-yuan banknotes, nine 1-yuan banknotes, and sixty-seven double dimes, but there was no business card, so his name was unknown and it was not known who he was. Therefore, the body was taken to the Feilun Road morgue and the Special District Court was reported to send Prosecutor Guo to bring a forensic doctor to the morgue to verify that the deceased was suffering from a small intestine hernia and the lower part of his body was extremely swollen. He died because of this. According to the police station, there were no relatives of the deceased found, so they ordered the Pushen Villa to claim the body for coffin burial.</p>
<h3>One Life Lost for Two Dimes</h3>
<p>Senior Apprentice Injures Junior Apprentice's Ear</p>
<p>Wu Kaitai, who lives at No. 20 Chongxiaoli, Menghualou, West Gate, has a jade workshop. His apprentice, Zhang Jinbao, 17 years old, asked his senior apprentice, Zhang Jinbiao, for two dimes the day before yesterday. Jinbiao was ashamed and angry, and slapped Jinbao twice, injuring his ear. He fainted immediately. Zhang Jinbiao was detained by the Second Precinct of the Second District, while Zhang Jinbao was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, the injury to his ear was fatal and his meninges were damaged, so he died immediately. Yesterday morning, the body was carried back and reported to the Land Court by Jin Qiren, the landlord of No. 22 Pu. After the prosecutor and others verified that he had died due to injury, they ordered the body to be collected for burial.</p>
<h3>Woman Commits Suicide Due to Debt</h3>
<p>Wang Yue, a Shaoxing native who lives at No. 11 Bing'anli, Chujiaqiao, French Concession, is 30 years old. Her husband is a fruit vendor. Last month, her husband borrowed money due to a lack of capital. Because her husband's business has been poor for days, she has not been able to make the daily payments and was forced by the creditor. She had an argument and was depressed. She suddenly had a suicidal thought. At about 11:00 yesterday morning, she swallowed raw opium and tried to commit suicide. Her husband drove her to Renji Hospital for treatment, but the treatment was ineffective. She died in the hospital at 10:30 that night.</p>
<h3>A Bloody Record of Eating Watermelon for Free</h3>
<p>Wu Wenbin, a Funing native who lives at No. 16 Changanli, Manzhou Road, Zhabei, accused his neighbor Li Delou and Li Zidao of assault at the Fourth District General Office. The director of the office asked the plaintiff Wu to provide a pushcart. He and Li had always been acquainted. Today, they suddenly quarreled with each other over trivial matters. He was so fierce that he grabbed a long watermelon knife and stabbed it into my leg, causing blood to gush out. I immediately used my hand to resist, and my finger was almost cut off. Now my hand cannot work and my foot cannot walk, so I am asking the office to investigate. Li Delou, who lives in the Fourth Alley of Changanli, sells watermelons for a living. The plaintiff forced me to eat my watermelon for free. I am a small business and I firmly refused. We wrestled with each other. Unexpectedly, he snatched my watermelon knife from the table and stabbed himself indiscriminately in an attempt to harm me. I ask for leniency. Li Zidao's statement is roughly the same as Li's. Since the case is related to injury and the testimonies of each party are contradictory, it was sent to the bureau for trial.</p>
<h3>Niece Accuses Uncle of Assault</h3>
<p>Breaking His Head, Attempting to Remove Trousers</p>
<p>The wife of Li Zhu, the owner of Demao Cigarette and Paper Shop at the corner of Peng Road on North Sichuan Road, recently filed a lawsuit in the Special District Court against her uncle, Li Songtao, accusing him of gathering a crowd to commit assault and battery. Her complaint alleges that her husband rented the remaining house to the defendant, Li Songtao, to open the Songmao Leather Shoe Shop. Around 7:00 AM on July 31st of this year, the defendant, Cai A’ming, recklessly threw a row of doors to the ground. When the plaintiff kindly advised him to stop, it was ineffective. Li Songtao, who had long harbored resentment towards her husband, immediately ordered his apprentices Zhang Kai, Tao Zhong, and Jin Xue to beat the plaintiff. Cai A’ming used a shoe pliers to break the plaintiff’s head and injure her left arm. Yuan Langsheng and others can attest to this. She immediately reported the incident to the Triangular Field Police Station, who went to Tongren Hospital to verify the injuries. Therefore, she specially requests that they summon the accused and punish them according to the law. Yesterday, Judge Feng of the Third Court of the Special Court summoned witnesses for questioning. The plaintiff, Li Zhu, recounted the events. The defendant, Li Songtao, stated that his nephew, Li Donglin, previously did not engage in proper work and was driven out by his father. The defendant persuaded him to return home. However, his niece, Li Zhu, was naturally assertive and learned that the location on North Sichuan Road was important and someone offered 240 yuan in monthly rent to dig up the tenant from the defendant's house. She instigated her husband, Li Donglin, to sue for rent arrears and eviction, but the plaintiff lost the case. Since then, the niece, Li Zhu, has harbored resentment and often provoked trouble. At the end of last month, the plaintiff closed the shop's row of doors and cut the electric wires. At that time, the plaintiff's son, A’pei, was upstairs and used a building material to smash the plaintiff's stove. Li Zhu happened to walk up from behind and accidentally smashed Zhu’s head. Therefore, he did not say it was the apprentice Cai A’ming who hit him, but instead twisted the blame on the police station because the witness Zhu Yi's testimony was inconsistent and not accepted. Today, she is falsely accusing him of assault and battery. Next, the plaintiff, Li Zhu, testified that her uncle, Li Songtao, slapped her ear, and the apprentice Zhong Jin Xue broke her head and pulled off her trousers. According to the witness Xing Yi, Cai A’ming broke the plaintiff’s head. The defendant's witness, Zhou Linsheng, testified that the plaintiff's head was accidentally hit by her son, A’pei, when he hit the stove, injuring his mother. Because of past grudges, he framed others. The defendant’s lawyer, Zhu Xiyun, stated that the plaintiff's and witness's testimonies were different. Zhong Jin Xue is only fourteen years old and very short. The plaintiff is quite tall, making it difficult for him to hit her head, let alone pull her trousers. The judge ordered a medical examination next Monday before further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Hu Laisheng Feels Life Is Worse Than Death Due to Poverty</h3>
<p>Hu Laisheng, a 50-year-old villager from the West Panjiazhai, Tushanwan, Xujiahui, in western Shanghai, has a large family to feed, but his ability to produce is weak. It has always been difficult for him to support himself. Recently, the price of rice has become so high that he feels he cannot maintain himself. Oppressed by the economic environment, he had the pessimistic thought that leaving the mortal world would be better. Therefore, he committed suicide by taking poison the day before yesterday. Resuscitation efforts failed, and he died. Yesterday, Zhuang Yaoming, the local guard of the 18th Tu of the 28th Bao, reported the incident to the local court for an examination.</p>
<h3>Zhang Suzhen Case Resolved After Death</h3>
<p>Zhang Suzhen, the only daughter of Zhang Zengyuan, a Suzhou native residing in Sanxin Lane, Aige Road, Chujiaqiao, French Concession, was 15 years old. She sang modern drama at the Xianshi World amusement park on Fuzhou Road. At 2:40 PM the day before yesterday, when she was returning home from the performance and passing by Min Ti Ni Yin Road and Xiafei Road in the French Concession, a funeral procession for a man named Ma was heading east. Zhang attempted to cross the road and was hit by a funeral car, number 6675, driven by the chauffeur Su Guisheng, causing fatal injuries and immediate death. The body was taken to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for an examination. Yesterday morning, the Criminal Section of the French Concession Police ordered detectives to summon the deceased's father and the defendant to the French Concession Court. Judge Zhu conducted the examination. The deceased's father stated that he had reached an out-of-court settlement and requested that the examination be waived and the case closed. Judge Zhu approved the request and instructed him to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>Fan Xinglong Lost His Wife While Watching a Play</h3>
<p>Zhang Yousheng Should Be Held Responsible</p>
<p>Fan Xinglong, a native of Taixing, worked as a farmer in his hometown. On the 11th of this month, he came to Shanghai for sightseeing, bringing his wife, Fan Zhu, with him. They stayed at the home of their fellow villager, Zhang Yousheng, in Lujiabang, for two days. Zhang then invited Fan out to see a play. Unexpectedly, when they returned home after watching the play, his wife was missing. Fan believed that Zhang had used a "luring the tiger away from the mountain" strategy and accused Zhang at the Second District, Second Precinct police station, who transferred him to the local court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Mitsui Sues He Gengxing Case Adjourned</h3>
<p>He Gengxing, the compradore of the Hardware Department of Mitsui Bussan Kaisha, embezzled a huge amount of money from the company and absconded, abandoning his business. The company’s manager, a Japanese man named Fukushima Kizoji, filed civil and criminal lawsuits against him, which have been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. Yesterday morning, the Civil Court President Ying Shi of the Special District Court continued the hearing on the civil part of the lawsuit. However, the defendant He Gengxing still did not appear. His attorney still claimed that there was hope for a settlement because the plaintiff had recently filed a criminal complaint against He, causing him to be apprehensive and unwilling to come forward for negotiations. The plaintiff's attorney then stated that if the defendant was sincere about reaching a settlement, the plaintiff would not make things difficult for him. Why hide for so long and only delay matters? President Ying adjourned the hearing to September 2nd, saying that since both parties were willing to resolve the matter peacefully, they would be given more time. If a settlement was still not reached, the hearing would resume.</p>
<h3>Chinese Compradore of Kobe TokuWa Bank</h3>
<p>Investigation Leads Nowhere</p>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, the Shanghai police authorities are currently searching for the Chinese compradore of Kobe TokuWa Bank at the request of the Hyogo Prefecture Police Department in Japan. It is alleged that he absconded to Shanghai with a large sum of money and securities from the bank. It is also said that he had been a shareholder in the bank for many years and was trusted by the managers. This time, after he left the bank on leave, it was discovered that the cash was slightly short. After a detailed inspection of the accounts, it was discovered that 100,000 yen in cash and a large amount of securities were missing. As a result, detectives were dispatched in all directions to search for him for several days, but his whereabouts were unknown. It was later learned that he had changed his name twice and arrived in Shanghai on the Asia Empress on the 8th of this month. Therefore, a request was made to the Shanghai police authorities to assist in the arrest. According to the investigation, when the Asia Empress arrived in port on the 8th, there was indeed a person who looked very similar disembarking in first class. However, it is unknown where he went. It is believed that he may have fled to Guangzhou. It is reported that he grew up in Singapore.</p>
<h3>Special Shareholders' Meeting of China and Foreign Telephone Company Held the Other Day</h3>
<p>Two Proposals Passed, Final Decision Scheduled</p>
<p>After the Shanghai China and Foreign Telephone Company sold all of its assets to the Shanghai Telephone Company organized by the International Telegraph and Telephone Company, it convened a special shareholders' meeting the other day to propose two motions. One was a motion for automatic liquidation, appointing chartered accountants Buick and Lang Heste as liquidators. The other was a motion to authorize the liquidators to distribute the funds and shares received by the company to the shareholders in proportion to their rights. On that day, a total of five Chinese shareholders and twenty-four foreign shareholders attended. Chairman Li Baili reported that the board of directors had signed a sales contract with the Shanghai Telephone Company on the 5th of this month, based on the resolutions of the shareholders' meeting on June 27th, and had agreed with the Gongbu and the Two Bureaus to cancel the company's original franchise contract. At present, the company is merely an empty shell, so liquidation is proposed. Then the two motions were put forward. As a result, the majority voted in favor of the passage. Now these two motions will be voted on again at a special shareholders' meeting on the 29th of this month as a final decision.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Maintains Order for Ships Docking at Dada Wharf</h3>
<p>The Dada Wharf in Nanshi, Shanghai, is small in area and crowded with ships. Recently, many fishing boats have been moored nearby, often causing ships to be unable to turn around when they approach the shore. They are forced to break through the waterway, causing the other ships to rock, and crew members and passengers fall into the water, resulting in numerous injuries and deaths. The Seamen’s Union heard about this and sent letters to the Jianghai Customs Port Authority and the Shanghai Port Authority, requesting them to formulate rules for ships docking at the wharf and to strengthen enforcement with water patrols. The Port Authority replied, stating that they had received the letter of August 2nd regarding the congestion of ships in the Dada Wharf area. They would instruct the patrols to do their best to eliminate the congestion there.</p>
<h3>Dispute Between Principal and Students at Wireless Telegraphy Training Institute</h3>
<p>Each Party Sticks to Its Own Story</p>
<p>Huang Zhicai, Zhu Liurong, Hu Qingfa, Chen Zhangsheng and other representatives of the student association of the Transportation Wireless Telegraphy Training Institute at No. 30, Tianjili, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, took the principal of the institute, You Jiazhang, a native of Suzhou, to the Fifth District Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau the other day, accusing him of privately establishing a school, defrauding them of tuition fees, demanding that the collected tuition fees be refunded, and requesting that he be punished according to the law. After Director You briefly questioned both parties, he instructed the court to investigate. According to the plaintiffs, the Transportation Wireless Telegraphy Training Institute was privately run by You Jiazhang. The Municipal Education Bureau had ordered it to suspend operations and not to register because of poor management. However, You continued to operate as usual. Recently, there was even talk of studying in the United States, neglecting the school's affairs. Therefore, they are requesting an investigation. According to the defendant's statement, the Transportation Wireless Telegraphy Training Institute, formerly known as the Transportation Wireless Telegraphy Special School, was established in October of last year and was registered with the Wireless Telegraphy Administration of the Ministry of Transportation. Later, it was renamed the current name by order of the Education Bureau. Since its opening in October of last year, it has enrolled students in three sessions. The first session, from last year to February of this year, had about 80 students. The second session, from April to August, had about ten students. The third session, from August to December, had about thirty students. Regarding registration, You stated that the Ministry of Education ordered that schools outside the capital should complete the registration procedures before September 1st of this year. The first two items of Item 122 had been completed by the institute, and there were no violations. He concluded by saying that recently, due to the lack of teachers, students were wearing undershirts in class, and the Education Bureau ordered the suspension of classes. Later, it sent personnel to inspect the premises, and they are currently waiting for instructions from the Education Bureau. Therefore, classes are being held as usual. However, a small number of students are afraid that no one will be responsible for the school because he is going abroad and are requesting a refund of their tuition fees. However, he has asked the Director of Studies to take care of the school's affairs. If the students want to request a refund, they can sue the Education Bureau or the court and should not act emotionally.</p>
<h3>Setting Up a Bogus Company to Defraud Goods</h3>
<p>Wu Sien Arrested and Brought in for Interrogation</p>
<p>The Hengde Paint and Silk Company at No. 29, Nankangfen Lane, was a fictitious company set up by Wu Sien and others from Shaoxing to defraud goods. On the 4th of this month, Wu and a man surnamed Jin went to the China Industrial Factory on Bailinan Road and claimed that they wanted to buy a large quantity of fake wool serge. The factory recognized them as legitimate businessmen and treated them sincerely. They complied with their request to select ten pieces of fabric samples and sent them to Hengde. Wu also followed and carefully examined the materials, saying that they were very suitable for sales and asked them to send another two hundred pieces. The factory sent the full amount on the 7th and 8th of the month. The calculated price of the goods was 4,380 yuan. Wu initially said that he still had to measure each piece and asked them to settle the account the next day. When they went to collect the payment on the appointed day, they made excuses to postpone it. When the factory staff went to Hengde the other day, all the goods in the house had been moved away. They realized that they had been defrauded and reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which dispatched Detective Wang Yongjun to arrest Wu Sien the other day. Yesterday, Wu was handed over to the Special District Court, where Judge Wu interrogated him and ordered the defendant to be detained for investigation, and the stolen goods should be located for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Prerequisite for Filing a Lawsuit for the Handing Over of a Person</h3>
<p>A Lawsuit to Confirm the Marriage Must First Be Filed</p>
<p>Cao Jingpei from Tongzhou hired lawyer Zhu Honglie to file a lawsuit for the handing over of a person to the local court. The complaint stated that on the 21st day of the first month of the Republic of China Year 16 (1927), he married Jin Fengying, the daughter of Jin Xinqing of Jinjia Lane, Beishou, Zhenru, through a matchmaker, and paid a betrothal gift of 200 yuan and a gold ring. It has been four years since then. In June of this year, Fengying returned to Ningjia on the pretext of a matter and has not returned. He was ineffective when he went to pick her up. Therefore, he is filing a lawsuit according to the law. The defendants, Jin Xinqing and his daughter Jin Fengying, hired lawyer Qu Yue to present a defense, stating that Fengying is 23 years old this year and was betrothed to Hu Adi when she was six years old. She married him when she was seventeen years old. On July 29th, at nineteen years old, Hu Adi died of illness. A neighbor, Zhang Xichao, seeing that Fengying was young and could be deceived, used the excuse of recommending her to work to deceive Fengying and bring her to Shanghai, where he introduced her to Cao Jingpei, his foster son. They lived together in a rented house in Beishou, Xinzha Bridge. Unexpectedly, after living together, Cao did not care about the household expenses, and Fengying could only blame herself for meeting the wrong person and had to work to support herself. Cao not only did not care about Fengying's life but also asked her for money to squander. She would be abused and beaten if she did not comply. Fengying could not bear the abuse and returned to her mother's home on June 18th of this year. At that time, there was a conflict, which was resolved by the local defense team. Since Fengying and Cao were not formally married, it was better for them to be free. Therefore, they signed an agreement and each was free. Unexpectedly, Cao Jingpei went to the police station to file a lawsuit and was unreasonably making trouble. The police station rejected the case, saying that since the defense team had resolved the matter and the two parties had separated, it would not create unnecessary complications. Therefore, they should be rejected. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Jinjian opened the court for a hearing. The plaintiff, Cao Jingpei, testified to the events. The defendant, Jin Fengying, testified that she and Cao were not husband and wife but were actually living together. She left because she could not bear the suffering. The defendant's lawyer stated that the plaintiff's lawsuit was fundamentally wrong and that he had not presented any evidence at all. It was completely an empty statement. He requested that the court rule according to the law. The judge said to the plaintiff, "The testimonies in this case are conflicting. It is not clear whether you are formally married or living together. You should first file a lawsuit to confirm the marriage. If the marriage is established, then you can proceed with the lawsuit for the handing over of a person." The plaintiff agreed and left the court.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Was the Catholic Solemnity of the Assumption</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 15th) was the solemnity of the Assumption, one of the four major solemnities of the Catholic Church in Shanghai.

<h3>Ciyou Association Investigates Xi Zhifang Case</h3>
<p>The China Ciyou Association received a report that Ni Yintao, the owner of a clothing shop at No. 88, Aijia Lane, Hongqiao South, in the city of Shanghai, was mistreating his 12-year-old apprentice, Xi Zhifang. They sent Wang Guan and Zhang Yueru, two cadres, to conduct an on-site investigation and inquire about everything from the shop owner, Ni Yintao. According to Ni, the scolding and beating were indeed true, but it was out of love for teaching and discipline. As for the claim in the report that his feet were swollen, it was not caused by beating. It was because Xi Zhifang was from the countryside in Pudong and had suffered from humidity. After hearing this, the two cadres immediately ordered him to show Xi Zhifang, but Xi Zhifang had been taken back to his hometown by his father two days ago for treatment and would return to the shop in a month. The timing was very unfortunate. Therefore, Wang and Zhang, believing that the one who caused the trouble was the shop owner's wife, asked the shop owner's wife to come out for questioning. She also admitted that she had scolded and beaten him, but did not injure his feet. At that time, the two gentlemen, being absent themselves, could not make a judgment and gave her a stern warning, registered the facts they had investigated, and declared that they would make a final decision in a month.</p>

<h3>Biscuits on Top, Opium Underneath</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at four o'clock, policemen of the Third Squad of Zhabei Police patrolled near the Xinzha Bridge on Datong Road and saw an old woman with neat clothes carrying a package walking on the road. Her expression was very panicked, and they suspected that her condition was suspicious. The police officer stepped forward to search. The woman insisted that the package contained biscuits and other groceries and did not need to be inspected. The police officer ignored her, opened the package, and found biscuits on the top. Unexpectedly, three packages of opium weighing nineteen liang and four qian were suddenly found underneath. The woman was taken to the Fourth District Headquarters for questioning. According to Gu, 57 years old, who lives in Xijie, Liuhou, Taicang, she practiced medicine. Her husband was ill, so she came to Shanghai to buy opium to take back for treatment. She was afraid of being discovered, so she put it in the biscuits and asked for forgiveness. She was judged to be privately carrying opium in violation of the ban and was sent to the Bureau for verification.</p>

<h3>Illustrated Records of Ancient and Modern Wars to Be Published</h3>
<p>Chen Renxian, a former Qing Dynasty Vice Minister, and his brother, Chen Shenxian, compiled the "Illustrated Records of Ancient and Modern Wars." From the Han Dynasty to the Ming Dynasty, all major wars are depicted in extremely detailed maps, totaling more than thirty maps. The roads used by the armies are marked with five different colors to show the essence of the strategies of the famous generals of the past. The evolution is also marked in five colors. There are many corrections to the errors in the evolution in Hu Linyi's "Reading History and Military Strategy."

Magistrate Qiu reported, and the following was discussed: [T13]One[/T] Can the recruited team members in each district who are currently paid be completely eliminated in accordance with the Hall Order? (Resolution) It is indeed difficult for each district to suddenly eliminate all of them in fact. After public deliberation, the number of recruited team members to be retained in each district is as follows: First District: Because no one attended, it will be left to the next meeting to resolve. Second District: One team member and one cook will be dismissed, and seven team members will be temporarily retained. Third District: Because four towns have organized defense teams, and there are currently only three team members, which is already insufficient for distribution, it was decided to temporarily retain them without dismissal. Fourth District: One detective and one cook will be dismissed, and six team members will be temporarily retained. Fifth District: One team leader and two team members will be dismissed, and four team members and one cook will be temporarily retained. After this deliberation, the team members in each district shall not increase recruitment without authorization, so as to avoid conflict with the Hall Order. Even for the team members temporarily retained this time, their term of service shall still comply with the provisions of Article 10 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Defense Team. They shall retire upon expiration. After retirement, if it is not necessary to employ them in terms of the situation, they shall not be employed. If it is necessary to employ them, it must be approved by the committee. [T13]One[/T] The names of the existing defense teams in each district shall be corrected in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Defense Team, and shall be uniformly prefixed with the name of the district, the team, and the card, etc. (Resolution) Correct immediately in accordance with the Hall Order, prepare two copies of the roster, and report them separately for storage and transfer. [T13]One[/T] The staff members of each district team shall be appointed in accordance with Articles 27 and 28 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Defense Team. (Resolution) Those who already have trainers in each district team shall be changed to military training officers. Those who have not set up trainers shall be added when this plan is implemented. The political training officers shall be responsible for the existing assistants and shall not be paid separately to save expenses. [T13]One[/T] The salaries of the staff members of each district team and the salaries of the temporarily retained team members shall be unified. (Resolution) 1. The military training officer shall be paid 25 yuan per month. 2. The assistant shall be paid 20 yuan per month. 3. The team members shall be paid 12 yuan per month. 4. The cook shall be paid 8 yuan per month for food and labor. [T13]One[/T] Should the office expenses of each district team be specified? (Resolution) It is temporarily set at 10 yuan per month for each district team. If the district team has not set up an office in Jia Pai, the payment shall be suspended. [T13]One[/T] In addition to the land tax collected by each district team, if special donations are directly collected from various merchants and civilians, what should these expenses be used for and should they continue to be collected? (Resolution) The heads of each district team shall prepare a budget based on the various recurring expenses discussed this time. The General Team Department shall plan for any surplus and submit it to the next meeting for resolution.</p>
<p>Zhangyan Sijing and Other Chambers of Commerce Prepare to Form</p>
<h3>Song and Tai Water Security Team</h3>
<p>The Zhangyan Town Chamber of Commerce in Jinshan County and the Sijing Town Chamber of Commerce in Songjiang County, etc., have suffered losses of more than 200,000 due to the lake bandits. More than 80 people were kidnapped, which can be described as an unprecedented catastrophe. Although the authorities intercepted and captured the giant leader and rescued the kidnapped people, dozens of guards and soldiers died in the fierce battle between the police and the bandits. Recently, Chonggu Town under Qingpu County and Xiadian Temple and Jin Suo Town under Jiashan County have successively been robbed. The violence of the bandits is so rampant that the peaceful people have nowhere to turn for help. After thinking about it, it is all because the police force in the local area is weak. If there is no way to improve the situation, the consequences will be unimaginable. Therefore, they are disturbing and contacting the gentry and merchants of the three counties of Su, Song, and Tai to prepare to form a water security team of 2,000 people, build 300 patrol ships, and publicly elect an experienced person who is good at suppressing bandits to serve as the general director to direct everything. The funds for starting the business are to be raised by the gentry and merchants of the three counties, and the annual expenses are to be levied on the fields of the three counties. They have now issued a declaration on the above situation and will convene a meeting of the public groups of the three counties within a week to discuss the progress. Once the decision is made, they can start the business.</p>
<h3>Recent Report from the Jisheng Association of Shaanxi Relief</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Association recently received a report from the Chang'an Branch of Shaanxi, stating that the usual expenses of the third disaster relief center in Wugong County, Shaanxi, for July, amounting to 600 yuan, had not been included in the previous accounts. They requested that this amount be included in the calculation and requested the association to send 30,000 bottles of Jisheng pills, a Shaanxi relief medicine. They stated that this medicine was perfectly suited to the needs of the Shaanxi disaster area, and that many people had been saved by its distribution, with the people praising its benevolence and expressing their gratitude. They also stated that the previous 30,000 bottles were running out due to the vast disaster area and the severity of the situation, and requested that if possible, more be sent to provide widespread relief, along with a letter of thanks. The association has already sent the relief funds to Beiping to be handed over to Mr. Zhang Xianqing, the director of Shaanxi Relief, for nearby allocation. Medicines will be sent again when convenient. The Shaanxi disaster is becoming more severe, and the Shaanxi Relief is already stretched thin. The association's continued assistance is truly a great relief.</p>
<h3>Extension of Fundraising Period for the National New Medicine Association Building Fund</h3>
<p>The National New Medicine Association's fundraising goal of 200,000 yuan for construction expenses, which was being solicited from medical and pharmaceutical organizations, was originally scheduled to end this month. However, due to the fact that Director-General Chu Minyi passed through Saigon and Singapore on his way to Belgium, where he distributed donation booklets to solicit donations, which are not easy to collect in a short time, coupled with the hot weather, making it inconvenient for domestic organizations to travel around, it has been difficult to conclude the fundraising. Therefore, the deadline has been extended by three months. Letters have been sent to various organizations urging them to make continued efforts.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor:</p>
<p>Having read the news item in the "Local News" column of your esteemed newspaper on the 15th regarding police officers investigating watermelon boats for tax evasion, it seems to be a misunderstanding. The matter is that the Local Goods Trade Association, due to the frequent thefts of local goods boats parked along the Suzhou River near the old Zhabei bridge, specially entrusted our company with their safekeeping and drew up a letter of authorization. Therefore, our company instructed the director of our office there to dispatch six workers with our company's insignia to provide security, not public security bureau police officers investigating watermelon boats for tax evasion. We fear that this will cause misunderstanding. We hope that the editor of the Shenbao will correct this.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Shanghai Wharf Cargo Storage Company</p>
<p>August 15th</p>

<h3>Younger Brother Becomes Protector</h3>
<p>— Guangmei</p>
<p>How high the fiery parasol of purely maritime Shanghai is raised during the day! People are so hot that they can hardly breathe. Sweat drips as casually as worthless tap water. Even dogs, feeling the heat, hang out tongues three inches long, mouths agape, panting as if mad, jumping restlessly. At the moment of dawn, red clouds, like a murderous aura, cover the sky. Before the sun appears, the cicadas have already torn their throats, desperately chirping wildly. The garden trees are still, their gentle branches motionless, enveloped in a strangely quiet, soft veil, as sweet and peaceful as a lovely lamb lying in its mother's arms suckling milk. All of this hints to us that the weather today is particularly hot. But every evening, the tyrant-like sun disappears into the vastness, forced to give way to the great, benevolent moon.</p>
<p>Great, benevolent moon, your gentle kindness shines all over the earth, your great maternal love extends to everything. At this moment, all things in the universe seem to break free from the shackles of depression. The first to leap for joy is the most lively and dynamic Aunt Wind. Even the people in the pigeon-cage-like alleyways always receive a bit of her caress. As for me, it goes without saying. I always catch a cold if I don't cover myself with a blanket in the middle of the night. If I forget to weigh down a lighter blanket, it will be blown to the ground, and the room will immediately become a mess. Aunt Wind's special favor towards me makes me endlessly grateful. Occasionally, I feel too cold and seem to need to change into cloth clothes. Then, hearing the chirping insects all around, I longingly believe it is a late autumn night.</p>
<p>We who live in this quiet wilderness, on the praised Jiangwan Road, can be called barbarians compared to those in the pigeon-cage-like alleyways with courtyards of less than ten square feet. Especially me, the back window of the house surrounded by trees looks out onto a small garden-style tennis court, truly a paradise on earth. Even so, after all, I am confined in the house, not as great as lying in the embrace of nature. The desires of humanity are endless! So, every night I have to go to the nearby park to cool off. The scenery there is quite different from what can be compared in the school. The vast expanse of Hongkou Park ranks first among the parks on the sea. It has the tranquility of Zhaofeng and is not as complex as the Bund. Every moonlit night, the undulating bridges, winding paths, rustic pavilions, irregularly shaped stones, lush trees, and beautiful flowers are clearly outlined. The fragrant and rich aroma of the pond lotus penetrates directly into people's sense of smell. The fish in the pond, because fishing is prohibited, are too numerous to count. Silvery, five or six rain-long white bellies often dart back and forth on the water surface. Countless fish mouths freely peck at the water surface, shattering the moon reflected in the water into fragments, emitting golden light. The music hall, standing alone in a corner, is filled with gray moonlight, seemingly containing infinite mystery. The green grass woven into a carpet stretches endlessly. Sitting casually on the grass, looking up at the dustless blue sky, is another boundless universe filled with pure poetry. Whose heart can match its purity? Whose state of mind can match its vastness? I am too small! Too small! Who dares to think they are not small? In such an environment, everyone is just a drop in the ocean. Nature and life, is life great, or is nature great? Hehe, I am intoxicated, so intoxicated that I don't know how to wake up. I am drunk, as if asleep in my mother's great, benevolent, loving embrace, loved so much that I don't know how to return. I am arrogant enough to look down on everything.</p>
<p>Therefore, the park is a place I must go to every night.</p>
<p>It is shameful to say that I owe this enjoyment of nature to my younger brother. When his school was not yet on holiday and he had not yet moved into the nearby boarding house, even though I had a gate pass, I still approached the park. But after school was dismissed and classmates returned home, I lost my companions invisibly, and my footprints disappeared from the park entrance. I didn't have that kind of courage. This courage! Can I still be considered a person? What am I talking about independence? What am I fit for? This ambition for the women's movement will probably always remain just empty talk. No, it's not that I don't dare, nor that I don't have this courage. It's just that I can't bear the trouble. No matter where you sit or what time it is, as long as you are alone, you never have to worry about someone coming to accompany you and break your solitude. What book are you reading? If you are studying hard during the day, it is hot, so take a break, take a break to play for a while. Of course, I will always ignore them. No matter how troublesome it is, I will always remain silent so that they have no way to start. It's really annoying, but you can only walk away and change the venue. But they also have legs and will follow you. Okay, let's sit here for a while. The wind is very cool, blowing straight here. He seems to be an expert in astronomy and geography. Why bother continuing to ignore them? He will say something like, "Is it really necessary?" Following, following, until he runs out of the park gate. The evenings are similar. If the lamp is not bright and you are straining your eyes studying, he will express concern. The rest is pretty much the same. In the end, it doesn't take long for him to come back. Originally, I went there to enjoy nature and use this environment to read and relax, but the harvest I got was such a pantomime. In my subconscious, I said, "This won't harm me in any way, it's just disturbing my mood," but I couldn't bear the trouble.</p>
<p>Now, with my younger brother accompanying me, we go to cool off every night. Although my younger brother is very young, he is slender and tall, looking like an adult. At night, no one bothers us anymore. We spend these beautiful summer nights very peacefully in the embrace of nature.</p>
<p>But sometimes I go a little early and my younger brother hasn't arrived yet. I open my book and read. As usual, someone will come and say those things that make you impatient and disturb your mood. At this moment, this unbearable moment, I am just hopefully praying that my younger brother will come quickly. I secretly think it's funny that my younger brother has become my protector.</p>

<p>Book Review</p>
<h3>A Sad Story</h3>
<p>— Yang Shaozhi</p>
<p>By Xiang Peiliang</p>
<p>Everyone knows that literature can stir people's hearts in many ways, enabling them to strive forward with courage.</p>
<p>If the literature of an era is active and upward-looking, it will naturally generate power. It can guide life and find a way out for the nation. Historically, literature has produced such achievements, as seen many times before. The complete development of the national consciousness of the Serbian people and their subsequent joint achievement of national political independence with the Yugoslavians was certainly aided by the national poems of the Serbian people and the faithful historical records of their national heroes. Therefore, if a writer is a thinker of the times, is correct in his views, and is willing to struggle, his works will naturally give people great and enduring strength, guiding life towards the path of effort and light. He can also ignite the torch of the nation, making national consciousness flourish.</p>
<p>At the same time, literature also has a role to record the historical traces of the past nation. It can disregard whether this is the glory or the misfortune of the nation, as long as it is portrayed faithfully and written into works, transmitted from this nation to another, and from this generation to the next, then it can fulfill a part of its mission.</p>
<p>The recording of facts about national glory can certainly make people know and admire national heroes and strive to be heroes to increase the happiness of the nation. But the recording of facts about the decline of national consciousness and the decadence of the public mind, if they are also disclosed as much as possible, I think it will certainly stimulate people's minds, making them feel the slackening of national sentiment and the madness and decadence of the public. Seeing their own nation showing the symbols of decline may also arouse their inherent spirit of courage and ignite the unextinguished torch to fight for the survival of the nation. In short, as long as literature is national, no matter what aspect it writes about, it will always give people a kind of striving force. In other words, all national movements are stimulated by their national literature.</p>
<p>This "Sad Story" is the creation of Mr. Xiang Peiliang. In this creation, the author uses the most faithful method of portraying the national illness to arouse people's sense of self-respect and self-reliance.</p>
<p>For thousands of years, many Chinese intellectuals have committed a kind of aloof and arrogant fault. Once they see the turbidity of society and encounter that they cannot realize their ideals, they will run to the mountains and forests to live their hermit and recluse lives. They never want to actively and perseveringly continue to work hard. The father in "A Sad Story" is such a character.</p>
<p>"Father is a talented but fallen person. He maintains his arrogance and dignity everywhere. He writes very well, and no one among his peers can match his poetry, calligraphy, and painting. He was a very early Japanese student, specializing in mining. When he was in Japan, he joined the Tongmenghui. After returning to China, he intended to do something good for society and the country. He was also the kind of person who could dedicate his whole life to a cause. But he later knew, and I now know, that society does not need such people. So, after doing a little work in the second year of the Republic of China, he left far away because he couldn't get along with others..."</p>
<p>There are countless such fathers in Chinese society, but what is the use of this aloofness? We know that if the power of good people hides away, the power of evil people can naturally become rampant. The result of this individual arrogance and individual aloofness, and the original intention of dedicating one's whole life to a cause, has become such a contradiction. It has even created a kind of national disease in China, forming these many bad habits in officialdom. As for the people's laziness and indifference to politics, haven't they also been caused by the defect of retreating to become hermits in the name of aloofness? The author has exposed it thoroughly. Do we have no way to excite people's minds? Let's work hard, let's work hard to create a self-confidence that where there is a will, there is a way.</p>
<p>But the mother in "A Sad Story" is a strong and face-saving woman. The story tells us this:</p>
<p>"Mother is very strong. She has never left anyone a handle to talk about in her life. She would rather consume her own blood and flesh little by little. At this time, we must not let others see our plight. Your father is a man who does great things. He has never bowed his head to anyone in his life. If he had just bowed his head slightly, he would have been rich long ago. We must fight for this breath for him no matter what. When I feel very tired from working at night and feel unable to support myself, Mother always says this to me."</p>
<p>She truly fulfills her duty as a wife. In a dilapidated family, she still firmly supports the lintel, making it not reveal any flaws. In many old families like this, if we don't have too much subjective thinking and are willing to criticize with a historical perspective, there are still some virtues worthy of praise.</p>
<p>If we casually understand this work from the literal meaning of the work, we will naturally feel that it is full of otherworldly and pessimistic thoughts. When this kind of thought swells to the apex, people will naturally feel:</p>
<p>"My life is an emptiness in emptiness, a nothingness in nothingness. I can't grasp anything, and I don't even have the desire to grasp anything. I don't even have sorrow, just like a bit of floating cloud blown by the wind that will soon dissipate. Now you can know why I am so addicted to playing cards. All the sorrows, all the pains, all the sufferings are still bearable. Only the pitiful emptiness must be filled in some way. No matter what I use to exchange for it, when I am playing cards, I can think about nothing. I can forget, and that is the only reason."</p>
<p>All the sufferings are still bearable. Only the pitiful emptiness must be filled in some way. From this, we know that pain and suffering do not have the power to dominate life. Only when one feels empty and loses the central consciousness will one be forced to take the road of despairing passivity. How incisively this describes the phenomenon of the decline of national consciousness among the people.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this work, if we are willing to savor it deeply with consciousness, we will understand its true meaning. It uses pointing out your shortcomings to give you a kind of stimulation, so that you can recognize the true meaning of life and rekindle your unfinished courage to work hard and bravely.</p>
<h3>The Story of World Literature (189)</h3>
<p>— Written by John Macy of the United States, translated by Hu Zhongchi</p>
<p>Chapter 48: American Poetry</p>
<p>As a lecturer at Harvard University and as a manufacturer of pedantic poems, the professor-poet who succeeded Longfellow was Lowell. He also understood the inferiority of his fellow Americans, and instead of through his poetry, but through his essays, tried to make a defense and seek revenge in a somewhat humble manner among foreigners. His poems, written in classical English, have almost no taste. The "Commemoration Ode," which became famous due to the opening ceremony of the building built at Harvard University to commemorate the students who died in the Civil War, is simply rhetoric. In the allegory written in soothing rhyme for critics, he said:</p>
<p>Carrying a large bundle of ISMs bound with rhymes,</p>
<p>Trying to climb Parnassus,</p>
<p>And so on, in self-reproach. However, when he let those ISMs run free in the satirical poem "Biglow Papers," which was composed in the literary imitation of the New England Yankee dialect, he also occasionally reached his best state. That poem has brilliance, humor, and a pungent exposure of American political folly. There is no other American satirical poem that has maintained such a long life. Why? Because satire is a fragile grass that withers along with the events of the era in which it takes root. And American satirists are more prose writers than poets.</p>
<p>Lowell's friend and Dr. Holmes, who lived across the Charles River, also reached the highest point in the range of his poetry when he wrote "The Deacon's Masterpiece" in the Yankee dialect. Even Dr. Holmes' greatest admirer, who saw the genius of style at least in the autocratic home, could not take his serious poetry very seriously. However, his occasional poems celebrating class integration and other happy events are clever, witty, and cheerful.</p>
<p>Emerson, the sage of Concord, was originally a prose writer. Some of his prose is eloquent and imaginative. He also wrote poems that are no less than those of many writers who are not naturally gifted poets. Emerson once said to his friend Thoreau that his myrtle and thyme were not completely transformed into honey. This is precisely the best way to describe Emerson's poetry. But once or twice, Emerson also played a true poetic tune. In "The Humble-Bee," there is an extremely cheerful outdoor air, and in "Brahma," there is a deeper philosophical tune. The rest of his poems seem to have fewer flickering fantasies than his prose.</p>

<p>Shanghai Market</p>
<h3>Commercial News</h3>
<p>The Cai Zhang Printing Company of Yuan Fu Li, Tangshan Road, Kunming Road, proclaims that their company is second to none among printing houses in Shanghai. Recently, they purchased a large batch of machinery from abroad, specializing in printing various trademarks, picture books, and pamphlets, with speedy delivery and especially low prices. The company's manager is Mr. Wu Bingquan, assistant manager is Mr. Xu Yinhai, chief engineer is Mr. Wu Zhicheng, and accounting director is Mr. Chuan Jinyu.</p>
<p>The Shenda, Shengda, and Weilun three factories declare that the domestic flower and plain camel wool was invented by these factories. Therefore, the products of these three factories are durable and fashionable, and have long been popular throughout the country. Everyone likes to use them. However, recently, various inferior camel wools have been sold on the market in the hope of passing off the spurious as genuine, cutting corners in materials, using crude raw materials, and loose weaving. Compared with the genuine camel wool bearing the three trademarks of Tiger, Dragon, and Phoenix, and Camel produced by Shenda, Shenda, and Weilun factories, there is a world of difference. In order to facilitate sales, these factories have specially collected various flower, plain, wide and narrow camel wools for joint sale. Any domestic and foreign customers who wish to purchase goods from the three factories can contact any one of the three factories. Samples are available and will be mailed upon request.</p>
<p>The Daqiang Trading Company of Nianhao, Museum Road, proclaims that this company is the general agent for various medicines refined by the American Abbott Laboratories, as well as excellent medicines for various skin and venereal diseases such as DRL brand 606 and 914, with great efficacy. They are available for sale in major pharmacies from today. Also, the Kofu Lan Jing medicinal tablets produced by this factory are popular all over the world and are truly a holy medicine for sterilization and disinfection. The most prestigious hospitals in Shanghai, such as the Shanghai Sanitarium, are happy to use them. Medicine samples and Chinese and Western brochures are available upon request.</p>
<p>The Jingda Factory of Pingjili Road proclaims that this factory was established by the wealthy merchant He Junxiang, with strong capital and a wide scope of business. Its "Airplane" brand flashlights are sturdy, beautiful, pleasing to the eye, durable, and have a long range of light. This factory adheres to the principle of resisting foreign goods and promoting domestic goods, so the pricing is particularly cheap. In order to connect with managers in various domestic and foreign locations and strive for cooperation, a special dividend will be distributed to each manager at the end of the year.</p>
<p>The Huimin Milk Powder Company proclaims that Huimin milk powder is completely different in nature from the various foods sold on the market that replace human milk or cow's milk. This is because Huimin milk powder is made of pure milk and contains a lot of milk fat and milk cheese. These are all rich in nutrients and life elements (i.e. vitamins), so the texture is particularly fine and soft, and the method of preparation must not be as easy to dissolve as ordinary foods that replace human milk or cow's milk and non-milk powders. Because Huimin milk powder contains the most valuable and beneficial milk cheese, the method of preparation must first be to mix it with boiled cold water into a slurry, and then rinse it with water (cold or hot, as you like) to be suitable. Also, because Huimin milk powder does not have cheaper sugar or rice flour mixed in, those who want a sweet taste can add as much white sugar as they like. At first glance, the above procedure seems very complicated, but in reality, it is vastly different in value from foods that replace human milk or cow's milk that can only fill the stomach but cannot cultivate a healthy foundation. Generally, foods that replace human milk and cow's milk, or milk substitutes, etc., that can be taken immediately by rinsing with boiling water have no or very little milk fat and cheese. Therefore, ladies from all walks of life should not neglect Huimin milk powder because the preparation procedure is slightly more complicated.</p>
<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>The Hongkou Grape Dance Troupe proclaims that this troupe will hold a revival of dance movement performances at the New Oriental Theater on Hengbang Bridge, North Sichuan Road, today, with both daytime and evening performances. The important programs include: (1) Mr. Song Zilong's "Xuangong Yanqu"; (2) Mr. Wu Zicai's "The Girl in the Red House"; (3) Miss He Huifang's "Lowell"; (4) Miss Huang Wenxiu's "Twilight"; (5) Miss Chen Shaoying's starring role in "Little Painter"; (6) Miss Cheng Yuzhen's main thesis, "Grape Fairy"; (7) He Huifang, Xu Xueqing, and Chen Keke starring in "Three Butterflies"; (8) Miss Fang Meili's "Civilized Marriage"; (9) Miss Shen Guifen's starring role in Miss Wangzhe Xiang's original school opera "Love Song Under the Moon"; (10) Miss Li Ruirao, Mr. Zeng Shanren, and Mr. Lai Linshu starring in "Sentimental Annoyance."

Tickets are sold for one dollar each, and a beautifully produced "Revival of Dance Movement" pictorial will be given away with each ticket.</p>
