<p>時評</p>
<h3>美日兩國之歲入不足</h3>
<p>美爲世界經濟最充裕之國。日爲東方新興之國。乃美因商業不振。收入减少。</p>
<p>原定所得稅减少百分之一者。明年恐不能减少矣。日本亦以商業不振。昭和四年度之歲入。較實行預稅。减收二千萬元。即除去不重要之支出尙少二三百萬元。其所少之數。祗能以三年之剩餘金塡補之。是以今日論。美日兩國之財政。均有入不敷出之概也。夫以美日兩國之富力。與政府之信用。即有不足。自必有其相當之籌措。固與其政府之施政無妨。惟觀微知著。工商國盛極而衰之徵象。亦已莫可隠諱矣。　且也歲收富餘之國。其一切支出。亦必視歲收薄弱之國爲多。故興盛之國家而一旦衰落。其程度亦必視貧弱之國家爲速。何也。支出之數。一時不能隨收入减少而收縮故也。世人不察。誤以今日商業不振爲偶然之事。而不知供過於求之貨物。將愈積而愈甚。决非一時間所能轉變。工商國財政之困難。諒亦非一時間所能挽回也。</p>

<p>上海萬國網球扶輪盃複賽、昨日下午四時半起、在中華網球場舉行、與賽者係中對葡及英對美之單打各兩組、惟以英之第二單打、餘棄權於英、實際上交鋒者、祗有三組單打、中華林寳華與邱飛海各以直落三勝葡卡那佛洛及柯沙、結果、中華共勝兩單打、英惠特亦以三對零勝美史密斯、同時英亦棄權一組、結果英美各勝一組、今日四時起、將有中對葡及英對美之雙打各一組、昨日三組比賽經過、分誌於左、</p>
<h3>林寳華逞强</h3>
<p>林寳華對手葡人卡那佛洛、海上著名雙打聖手之一、其單打技能遠不及其雙打之穏健、然非其二識不足、實緣體力欠壯之故也、當其劇戰之初、老將軍横刀躍馬、固屬一時之雄、第一局即攫爲已有、林寳華手法純熟、胸有成竹、對方强弱之點、早已了然於心、故於進退左右之際、高擘、低欄、正抽反撃、直中敵人要害、第一局負後、即連後三局超前之、終以六比三勝第一盤、第二盤林之球勢尤盛、而卡氏對付益窮、不久林又以六比一得利、第三盤卡氏雄心勃發、不甘落後、幾度掙扎、極盡努力、林初擬匹馬直入、完成大功、顧以對方强頑、轉成緊凑局勢、第三盤最後勝利仍以六比四歸林、然此中確有一番劇戰也、</p>
<p>（中）林寳華（六……三　六……一　六……四）卡那佛洛（葡　）</p>

<h3>邱飛海稱雄</h3>
<p>邱飛海以穏健之手法、巧妙之技能、殺得葡人柯拉沙束手無策、大敗特敗、柯氏本爲新進之怪傑、善奔跑、能耐戰、此番遇邱、戰前早有策略、擬攔網取巧、以冀萬一之望、不料邱氏怱東忽西之邊球、已使其手足失措、偶而會時忽至、趨前攔網、而後方空虚、又爲邱氏乘隙直入、總之、柯氏業將全身本領、完全顯露、然卒被邱氏顚倒左右、隨心所欲、第一羅六對零、第二第三兩盤、結果亦如之、三盤十八局、始終在邱控制之下、獲得全勝僅費四十分鐘光陰、良不多觀也、</p>
<p>（中）邱飛海（六……○　六……○　六……○）柯拉沙（葡）</p>
<h3>惠特顯身手</h3>
<p>英人惠特執、海上單打霸權有年、昨日在美人史撃、如狂風暴雨、難於抵禦、第一盤尤爲其驚人之作、而以直落六全勝、第二盤雄健如故、除第四局史氏以攔網奪回一局外、其餘均告失敗、結果惠特以六比一占勝、第三盤惠特在五比一占先之優勢下、忽逞疲乏之狀、突受史氏打撃、損失兩局、幸而技藝高下殊懸、故終以六比三獲勝　　（英）惠特（六……○　六……一　六……三）史密斯（美）</p>
<h3>各個人技藝</h3>
<p>昨日三組人才、頗分高下、故均以一面倒局勢、而分勝負、勝者三人、亦各有特長之點、邱氏穏健老成、位置極佳、林氏發球有勁、善於攔網、惠特抽撃合度、球不虚發、而失敗三人中尙推卡氏實力較强、其餘二人、相差益遠也、</p>
<h3>今日雙打賽</h3>
<p>今日下午四時起、中對葡、英對美均在原塲作雙打賽、中華將以江道章鄭兆佳出場、與葡代表卡那佛洛柯拉沙對抗、同時英惠特與司托克斯對美史規亞與漢恩士作戰、英美之勝負、有關將來大局、雙方極重視之、而中葡之戰、關係較爲輕鬆也、</p>

<h3>秋窗小談</h3>
<p>— 志政</p>
<p>初秋畫長。齋居寂寥偶憶時人軼事。摭述一二。用資談助焉。</p>
<p>街頭之吳稚暉　吳稚暉先生、自調停戰事、未有結果後。即息影滬濱。深居簡出。某日後。予以事至大馬路石路。口忽見先生方緩步北行。衣一舊杭綢長衫。白鞋。頻以手帕拭額汗。時石路人擠。先生至各衣舖。恒小立數分鐘。注意所懸之衣物。以先生形如鄉曲。終無有識之者。予原擬作先生五分鐘之隨員。藉觀偉人之行止。惜以事末能。迄今猶以爲憾也。</p>
<p>車站之宋子文　財政部長宋子文。運籌帷幄勞苦功高。而予則未嘗能一瞻其風采。一日之晨。予方有事于車站。驟見武裝軍警。分佈要口。拔槍出匣。狀如戒嚴。一時空氣異常緊張。俄一軍士携手機關槍往來巡邏。行人益滋疑惑、方驚訝間。一汽車入站。軍士趨前接迎。即見宋部長緩步下車。衣白嗶嘰西裝白帽。身材魁梧。目懸靉靆、一時沿途軍警。高呼立正。並舉手爲禮。宋含笑答之。</p>
<p>黄包車上之黎照寰　黎照寰。鐵道部常務次長也。兼任交通大學副校長。每週三日蒞校餘日在京。僕僕京滬。不辭勞瘁。氏蒞校辦公。每日絕早。有時則僅乘人力車。輕車簡從。衆不知其爲校長也。又聞氏雖貴爲次長。而至今尙未結婚。國人每喜早婚。甚至個人經濟尙不能獨立。而即侈言戀愛。以觀黎氏。賢不肖相去遠矣。</p>
<h3>新都舊語</h3>
<p>— 李弢安</p>
<p>金陵有某世家。其姓氏漫不可考。奉行謨罕默德敎。篤信維謹。有悉其先世歷史者。輙復舉以相告。聞者以其婉轉動聽。每爲神往焉。</p>
<p>遜清同光年間。國内交通事業。尙未發達。行人往來。必賴舟車輿馬。藉以代步。有皖中某甲者。流庽白下。御驢爲業。頻年以來。揚鞭執鐙。奔走追隨。狀至勞瘁。顧爲人極誠實遇事果斷。善伺顔色。頗得人歡。會有新貴某公。以事晋省謁見。遺其行篋於途。篋中儲藏機要文件甚夥。遍覓不獲。大爲惶恐。遂張招貼於通衢間。以冀合浦之還。適爲某甲拾得。亟返物主。主人覩其愚騃可喜。厚加賞識。留爲已用。旣而某公開府江南。勢位顯赫。甲亦附驥尾而上干名器。平步青雲。曾幾何時。已甲第連綿。儼然大家矣。當時有落拓名士某者。坎坷半生。不爲世用。傲骨嶙峋。詞壇怪傑也。索悉其微時事。諷之以詩。傳頌藝林。播爲美談。句云「藍翎五品掛朝珠。赫赫巍然大丈夫。曾記灞橋風雪裏。揚鞭得意呌都都。」末謂都都者。蓋形聲也。傳神阿堵。妙到毫顚。辭意尤謔而不虐。極盡嬉怒笑駡之能事某甲聞之。亦屬無可如何。付之一笑而已。</p>
<h3>書胡子靖書後</h3>
<p>— 和庵</p>
<p>長沙爲共匪燒殺。造成空前浩刦。前各報登載被殺之胡子靖先生。昨忽晤於漢上。詢及一切。知其因喪妻初歸。且以精力不及。力辭湖大校長。未先避亂。遂陷城中。謠言之興。確實因此。胡先生於前清癸卯創辦明德學校。迄今二十八年。爲校欵奔走。不遺餘力。而操行廉潔。不苟取。無私蓄。社會以此重之。胡以得社會之同情。故年六十。仍事奔走。不知其老之將至。實未可與葉德輝之傲岸不循常軌者。相提并論。明德初辦中學。繼辦師範初小高小。民國二年。設大學於北京。八年復設大學於漢口擬再遷北平。卒以經費不充。於十四年停辦。在長沙專辦中學。大事擴充。國民政府成立。奬勵有加。去秋八月。湖南政府聘請爲湖南大學校長。已近開學。遂出維持。一年以來。深感不能兼顧。仍欲注全力以維持明德。貫澈其堅苦眞誠之初志。何芸樵與先生。實無師生關係。且不常見面。蓋其擔任湖南大學。非因何芸樵個人。乃爲湖南敎育盡力。且先生數十年從不作政治生活。全國皆知。謂其晚年借校長一職。進謀省務員。尤覺擬於不倫。令知胡先生者失笑。和庵與先生交最久。先生募欵南洋時。曾爲之助。以是知其事甚悉。方二君所記各節。多有不符處。因特補書之。并表先生無恙。以示海内之知先生者。</p>
<h3>杭垣四洞紀游</h3>
<p>— 何海生自杭寄</p>
<p>吾杭名勝。甲於天下。歷年中外士女聯袂來游者。絡繹不絕。幾如山陰道上。日前知友秩初君來舍。約游黄龍洞。是日天陰。似有雨意。秩初促余行。余恐中途遇雨。猶豫莫决。秩初奮然曰。盍不冒險一行。余從之。乃整衣同出。乘公共汽車至觀音站。下車後。步行约三里。</p>
<p>黄龍洞　門已漸近。甫入。即見兩旁水池。更進。有亭翼然。厦屋華美。假山四圍。玲瓏細巧。上有虎口形者三。清泉潺潺下流。歎觀止焉。然洞尙在其上。遂拾級而登。不數十級。有乾隆御碑一方。有頃。已達目的地。直搗黄龍。洞中渺無一物。惟雜疊之山石而已。徘徊片刻即下。旣出復登</p>
<p>紫雲洞　道旁樹木參天。頃達洞口。上有揭曰洞天勝地。洞内有佛三尊。愚夫愚婦。對之膜拜。其旁七星泉在。黝暗無所見。有石凳可供客坐。光綫較黄龍洞充足其外觀雖不及。内則過之。余與秩初坐食所携糕餅以果腹。而游興未闌。順道往謁</p>
<p>蝙蝠洞　蝙蝠千萬。攅集其内。臭不可聞。况洞中無路可入。掩鼻過之。改訪</p>
<p>金鼓洞　係宋朝遺跡。謂當時道士常聞鐘鼓之聲。尋之杳然。遂以是名。荒謬之說。似可信而不可盡信。外有老子像。右旁一洞甚狹小。水滿其中。深淵莫測。别亦無足記者。迨歸。秩初傲然曰。今日當痛飲。以慶冒險之成功。乃小酌酒肆。分道而散。（却酬）</p>
<h3>談貓</h3>
<p>— 吳天倪</p>
<p>貓性柔順而活動。喜傍人起居。然敎之以方。亦未嘗無可用之處。惟其智慧遠不如狗。國中閨秀多喜蓄之。若男子則殊少受之者。然如下列數則又非可一概而論矣。</p>
<p>曩歲余家蓄一特狗。名靈靈。種類甚佳。惜已變雜。色純黑而頗小。求偶時。殊難覓同等身材之母犬。適家有一貓。爲牝性者。大與狗埓。於是此狗忽發奇想。常與此貓互相倚偎。纞愛備至。普通之貓皆畏犬。而此貓獨怡然相處。有時直竪其尾。聲聲呌喚。一切聽其所爲。然貓狗異途。難成事實。遺污滿身。殊堪發噱。貓色全白。乃逾年有孕。竟産一純黑小貓。此非狗之所有。可爲確斷。但母貓全白。而此子獨純黑類狗。亦巧事也。天下事眞有不可思議如此者。此小貓漸大。竟與靈靈熟稔異常。靈靈亦愛之甚。嘗臥狗窩中。狗且與之同臥焉。閱數月。此貓狗均長大。相愛亦如往時。但余自别鄉里。倐又再載。不知近作何狀矣。</p>
<p>外姑周氏。荆人梅閣之母。崇信佛敎。家有佛堂一。佈置頗清潔。一昨於佛前几上産貓一窩。家人以其凟佛莊嚴也。乘母貓不在。移至室門後網籃之中。不意經此挪動。母貓竟不承認其子女。千方百計。捉之餵乳。不顧焉。現此項小貓。計共五頭。生甫三日。哀號終夜。已饑餓待斃矣。嗟嗟何辜。演此慘劇。不知讀者有無方法。能令母貓回心重哺其子女否。</p>
<h3>比國兩大博覽會略紀（下）</h3>
<p>— 六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>安威斯爲比國西北部文化中心。與里也支之爲東南部文化中心遙遙相對。居民說Flamanp語。與荷蘭語航德語相近。此處博覽會與里也支覽會性質不同。全以各國殖民地出品爲主。中國旣無殖民地。且求不爲他人之殖民地而不可得。當然無資格參加此會。　　　　參加各國規模之最大者。爲法。英。日本。荷蘭。意大利等。均各建巨厦。係侈陳所屬殖民地之收穫。</p>
<p>華人游此。最覺痛心者。即日人對於南滿之宣傳是。日人參加此博覽會之目的。乃全在對各國宣傳南滿洲爲其殖民地。故朝鮮。臺灣。琉球等處在此次博覽會反占次要地位。其占主要地位者實爲南滿。日人特建一亭。滿懸南滿洲之照片。統計表。及所産黄豆落花生等之標本。照片中之華人多着長袍戴瓜皮帽而受着西服之日人指揮。據其統計表云。現在南滿年産黄豆四百六十萬噸。其四分之三供歐洲人之需要云。又有地圖一幅。將南滿與日本塗以同様顔色。此南滿亭尙懸有漆刻對聯一幅。語云「居士農工商於斯室」。「萃東南西北之大觀」。欵題王占元書。觀此可知日人野心如何。可知日人辱我至何程度。</p>
<p>出日本館至法國館。亦有令人慨歎之事。蓋法國於盡力宣傳非殖民成功之餘。又特設一室誇示其侵略黄種人之成績。此室即安南館是。安南本無特殊文化。其所有者均襲自中國。故案南館中陳列之物均全似中國之物。館中各門均懸金漆聯對。記其正中一聯云。「東海三祈。珠玉文素有自」「法恩四境。富强藝業爭開」。欵書「上祝大法國萬萬歲。東安南樞　郡敬頓」。中國文字徒供亡國人民歌功頌德之用。豈不可哀。</p>
<p>其他可紀之事尙多。因本報篇幅有限。故均從略。總之。據記者個人意見。此次博覽會我國本無參加之必要。（美國德國等均未參加）旣欲參加矣。即當爲大規模之參加。爲有計劃之參加。對於出品之選擇陳列等。應當研究西人心理。講求科學方法。庶幾於表揚國粹之外。可爲對外貿易宣傳之一助也。</p>
<p>更正　昨日本篇末四行應排在「南部會塲……」一節之前。特此更正。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（二六○）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十三回　是誰種福無意得鑽環　惟此因緣有心歌金縷</p>
<p>這一天。因爲來賓衆多。做主人的自不免有些忙亂。但其餘的四位主人還好。凌趾祥今天是主人中的主人。更加忙得走頭無路。什麽事都要去問這位凌大少。可是他覺得很有興趣。吃酒的時候。他又主張十檯酒同時擺開。呌局的時候。就閙得一個花飛枝亂。局來的時候。更嚷成一片燕噪鶯喧。七八十位客。每人呌一個局。也就有七八十人。而凌趾祥又宣言。局越呌得多越好。每人極少要呌兩圙局。眞個成了。「萬人空巷鬧新妝」的局面。把上海的北里名姬。都呌空了。這時候。在左詩晨的鄰席上。來了一個堂唱。對於客人覥覥。大概是一個初出山的小先生。那位跟局的。却是一位嬌俏甜凈的阿姐。肆應客人。措置裕如。好像在娼門中有了素養。不似那班來自田間者。左詩晨因想到雖在堂子裏。用人也很有經濟。璧如這位出堂唱的先生。自已是個出衆之材。跟堂唱的差一點。却没有關係。甚而至於弄一個老太婆來跟跟。也不覺得討厭。若是出堂唱的先生吸不住客人。那末傳佐之材。自不可少。尤其是初出道的雛妓。全賴有個跟堂唱的好阿姐。隨時指點。從前在帝制時代。皇帝幼冲。非賴有幾個賢明忠純的大臣。爲之師傳。輔佐幼君。就是這個主義。左詩晨心中這様想。不免頻頻向那裏顧盼。覺得這位跟局的大姐。有些兒面熟伊見左詩晨向伊看。伊也向左詩晨回眸一笑。從前的跟堂唱都時站在那裏的。因爲伊所站的地位。和左詩晨很近。伊便走過來道。您是姓左嗎。您是左二少嗎。左詩晨愕然道。你怎麽知道。伊笑了一笑道。您想不起來了嗎。從前在翠筠房間裏。我見過你的。左詩晨聽了。隠約有些記得。可是也呌不出伊的名字來。因問道。你現在跟了的這位先生。呌什麽名字。伊却不回答這句話。反問左詩晨道。翠筠阿姐出來了。你去呌了没有。左詩晨道。眞的嗎。我一點也不知道呀。還是呌翠筠嗎。在什麽地方呢。伊道名字是換了一個。喚作懺儂。地方是在百花底。左詩晨取了一張局票在手。說道。是怎様的寫法呢。伊道。懺就是和尙道士拜懺的懺字。儂就是汪笑儂的儂字。左詩晨道。好一個懺儂名字。什麽人給伊題了這個名字。伊道。聽說是三阿姐自已題的。</p>

<p>棉市晨跌午漲、美棉又跌二十磅音、而本埠多頭心理觀高、本月份多頭公司勢難支持、轉讓斬結於某廠商、作價三十二兩五錢、故某廠商在期棉市場、重行購進加碼、兩日購進四五千擔、散空扒補、市盤激動稍漲、遠月亦被其牽動云、　　漢標晨軟午健　人標前市開盤、市氣極疲、隨外棉跌二錢半至三錢、午後以本月份關係、遠月帶漲、市氣略堅、本月漲五錢、遠漲二錢半、全日成交統計五萬七千六百擔查賣出愼昌三千三百擔、勤豐二千二百擔、大昌成一千九百擔、茂記一千九百擔、利昌一千八百擔、益昶·泰昌·裕康·天昌·晋豐·恊生·大孚·達記·泰興一千二百擔至一千九百擔、買進恒大一千二百擔、昌記三千擔、裕大二千九百擔、泰興五千三百擔、義餘三千三百擔、達豐二千四百擔、茲將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>世界棉市跌風又起</h3>
<p>美棉南方套售續跌　昨日美棉因空户抵補及南方套售、市况參差不定、計期貨跌十至十七磅音、現貨跌二十磅音、英棉期貨跌五六點、現貨不動、埃及棉現貨跌十五點、印棉停市、原電錄左、（二十一日電）</p>

<h3>上半期中國棉業統計</h3>
<p>紗錠漸見增加…外棉進口益巨</p>
<p>華商纱廠聯合會最近發表本年上半期各紡廠轉運紗錠及原棉消費存底之統計如下、（原棉存消以五百磅重大包爲單位）</p>
<p>原棉　本年上　去年下　原棉本年上　去年下銷費　半期　半期　存底半期　半期中棉　七七０七八五　七六二０一七　二二六七九六　二四六七五０美棉　一六一五二０　一二九六四七　五八四一五　四四六００印棉　一六四二一八　一九八七四六　一二八九七五　五一二八八埃及棉　一五八四　八六一　一四二０　一六三七其他　五一六六　一二五一　九五０　四八二共計　一二０三二七三一０九二五二二　四一六五五六　三四四七五七　　錠數　▲停工</p>
<p>實開數三八二七九００　三六九九四０二停錠數四四八四一六　五六五八三一建築中　二００九五０　一八０九四０停鐘點　一三二０　一八三七　　停週數一·二五　二·一三　　觀上述统計、有兩點値得吾人注意、即（一）中國紡業漸見進步、（二）爲外棉需用益形增進是、中國紡業自前年以來、頗屬順利、添錠設廠時有所聞、近雖因匯率之變動而稍受影響、然截止六月底、實開錠數（指纱錠而言線錠與廢花錠不在内）爲三八二七九○○枚、在裝置中者二○○九五○枚、總數將達四百萬枚、實開錠數比去年底增十二萬八千餘枚、如政治日趨正軌、前途希望無量、惟此數字中尙有日商占百分之三十九、英商占百分之四强、此仍望政府與民衆之維護、促其進展、以防止外商勢力之繼長增高也、</p>
<p>半年間原棉消費以紗綻之增加、數字亦增、但外棉之增加率較華棉爲大、存底亦然、此對於中國棉産有重大之影響、查中國近年棉産量約五六百萬担、不敷紡廠之消費甚巨、且品質粗短、不宜精紡、豫之靈寳、纖維雖較細長可參紡三十二支以上之紗支、然爲數旣少、且有退化之象、益故紡較細之纱枝必用美埃等棉、外棉進口乃巨、試取海關貿易册觀之、厥棉之入超近年將邇一萬萬海關兩之巨、以農立國之國家、而農産品有巨量之入超、實堪令人猛省、於農於工均有莫大之危險、故推廣産量改良品質、實屬振興棉業不容緩忽之事也、</p>
<h3>糧食　河下米市陡跌</h3>
<p>閘北　昨日裡路來源轉接、市销不佳、北粳滬存雖不多、然店底尙充、因此頂粳雖仍二十一元、而普通中關均跌兩三角、查跌勢較足者、須小半元之鉅、是以市形大軟、觀察往後粳情、尙須下游、緣西新一經上市、常錫積貨勢必脫售、况邇來洋米不振、湘米將裝、兼之今歲東新粳出數較往歲須多一倍、日來每朝到埠、常在千石左右、故滬上破粳雖枯、然仍無妨、刻下廠方漸漸脫出、昨市乃立跌半元、開高十九元、趨勢帶萎、新客尖買氣平淡、行情見短一兩角、參羊尖略有見抵、勉開十五元左右、白元到源轉旺、銷場呆滯、頂貨小角半、開十九元三四角、市上眼光均看十九元、此間全日各貨、一致陡跌、市勢甚軟、　　滬南　河下稍有見抵、街銷清淡、北帮白破刻亦回跌三角、趨勢將隨北市而行、普通貨盤旋於二十元左右、南邦薄稻來貨微接、亦跌一兩角、高貨開二十元零五六角、東新粳回短半元、開十九元、變元貨不旺、大盤在十九元關口、</p>
<h3>洋米高疲次俏</h3>
<p>昨日洋米有内地帮辦裝中次米、市形轉活、大小絞敏黨各米交易見多、行情亦爲帶俏、惟一號西貢存無較多、消化反呆、市面乃與中次貨背馳、统市買開一號西貢五百包、價十六元至十五元八角、比前小去角外、二號西貢三百包、價十四元一角六分、小絞二千包、價十五元至十四元六角、大絞一千五百包、價十二元四角、紅大絞價十一元七八角、敏黨六十包、價十五元二角二分至十四元八角半、均比前市轉砌云、</p>
<h3>多頭操縱下之粉市</h3>
<p>金價回漲…近期空頭祗得逐步抵補</p>
<p>昨日粉市、又呈步佳之勢、以本月份已爲多頭大量吸收、業中空頭籌碼究屬有限、業外空頭、在此硬抬之中、除逐步抵補外、已無他法可想、至遠期各月份、雖洋麥報小一二角左右、惟金市又見回漲、人心未免爲之帶動、觀此種局面、如此後需要一活、大户多頭勢必愈抬愈緊、否則人言嘖嘖、當不致過分操縱也、結果本月份較前日又好一分二厘半、九月份好一分半、十·十二·一月份好一分、十一月份好七厘半、</p>
<h3>期麥步開步高</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面一致續昂、尤以本月份爲更甚、因本月份將近交割、市上存貨、雖約計達六七萬、惟多數均係中次、高貨不多、合於交易所之標準者尤覺寥落、因此交易所標準、因交割關係、彷彿奇貨可居、故自開價之後、步開步高、形成軋空之象、九月份因接近本月份、漲勢亦頗可觀、遠期則尙平穏、結果本月份較前日又激提六分、九月份似漲四分、十月份至一月份各漲二分、現麥因貨係中次、不合廠胃、各擋又跌四五分、開徐州·瑤灣·黄喬·牛莊麥、共四千餘包、由福新·阜豐等辦去云、</p>
<h3>疋頭中外貨走銷大靜</h3>
<p>本廠棉布　昨市略軟、美棉步落及八月底將届之故、細布小五分、細斜小二分半、粗布貨缺、定尙粗斜温台帮成交五六十件、十六磅五元寳售七兩五錢七分半、十四磅人塔六兩三錢半、十一磅貓壓五兩、怡和漂布、津帮略有成交、金三塔爲七兩六錢、雲外飄香七兩八錢、</p>
<p>東西疋頭　實銷觀望不前、執貨者須到期墊銀、市日疲弱、成交之靜、近有所罕見、深色花色汀已到錢九左右、水浪絨小二厘半、光斜亦頗不振、世樂鳥細布跌一錢、售七兩七錢半、漂布小五分、鵲橋會爲十兩零七、花鳥七兩三錢半、石崇七兩七、惟直貢呢直貢緞始終堅挺、西貨冲泰西緞長江帮昨有添辦、沙遜天官爲三錢三分半、公平九財童三錢三、厚直貢呢亦略有走動云、</p>
<h3>絲茶珍眉綠茶英銷略動</h3>
<p>來路莊之珍眉綠茶、英莊錦隆·天祥·杜德等行、昨均有電轉交易、惟因先令放長、市盤見低五六兩、針眉珠茶等項、亦略有零星交易、價無漲落、最關重要之華茶俄銷問題、前以漢口辦茶俄人被捕、宣告停辦、昨據漢口來電、武漢軍事當局、對該俄人已允釋放、茶銷似無妨礙云、</p>
<h3>南北貨下檔粤枝開價緊秀</h3>
<p>下檔粤枝、近以步場活潑、價頗堅挺、昨市號貨又有開出、水東枝開至十六兩以上、揀莊枝十三兩左右、以次爲十一兩左右、比之低盤時均升兩許、實以價頗廉宜、易以行銷、故來源雖多、市價反趨緊秀云、</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Insufficient Revenue for the United States and Japan</h3>
<p>The United States is the most economically prosperous country in the world. Japan is a newly emerging country in the East. However, due to sluggish commerce, revenue has decreased in both countries.</p>
<p>The originally planned 1% reduction in income tax in the United States may not be possible next year. Japan is also experiencing sluggish commerce. The revenue for the fourth year of Showa is 20 million yen less than the estimated revenue, even after removing unimportant expenditures, it is still short by 2 to 3 million yen. The shortfall can only be covered by the surplus from the past three years. Therefore, as of today, the finances of both the United States and Japan are generally in a state of deficit. Given the wealth and government credit of both the United States and Japan, they will undoubtedly have corresponding measures to address the shortfall, which will not hinder the administration of their governments. However, by observing small details, we can see that the signs of prosperity in commercial and industrial nations reaching their peak and declining are already undeniable. Furthermore, countries with surplus revenue will inevitably have more expenditures than countries with weak revenue. Therefore, when a prosperous country declines, the rate of decline will inevitably be faster than that of a poor country. This is because the amount of expenditure cannot be reduced as quickly as revenue. People fail to realize that the current sluggish commerce is not an accidental event, but that goods in oversupply will continue to accumulate and worsen, which cannot be reversed in a short period of time. The financial difficulties of commercial and industrial nations are also unlikely to be resolved in a short period of time.</p>

<h3>A True Account of the Hardships of Chinese Laborers in Malaya</h3>
<p>Tin and Rubber Prices Fall, Unemployment Increases Sharply</p>
<p>Unable to Return, Unable to Stay</p>
<p>The Golden Age of the Past Has Now Become a Relic</p>
<p>Penang Correspondence: The Malay Peninsula, located in the tropics, is covered with dense vegetation. There are many reasons for its prosperity today, but the perseverance and hard work of the Chinese laborers who cleared the way have made a considerable contribution. The Malay Peninsula is world-renowned for its rubber and tin, and the majority of the labor for tapping rubber and mining tin relies on Chinese laborers. During the highest price period (around 1921), Chinese laborers who came south enjoyed a superior economic status. Therefore, those who did not understand the current situation in Southeast Asia regarded Southeast Asia as a land of wealth, and it would not be difficult to return home loaded with riches after coming south. Who knew that the golden age of Southeast Asia would soon become a relic of history? Because of the drop in rubber and tin prices, Chinese merchants who ran small businesses closed down daily due to the decline in commerce. Chinese laborers who sold their labor faced increasing unemployment due to the restriction of rubber and tin production. Unable to return, unable to stay, their suffering of displacement and hardship cannot be described in words. The plight of Chinese laborers in the Malay Peninsula is briefly described below:</p>
<p>Singapore Prepares to Distribute Porridge: Although there has been no precise survey of unemployed Chinese laborers in Singapore, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce believes that the number of unemployed workers in the port is increasing day by day. During the day, they wander the streets and alleys, begging for leftover scraps to fill their stomachs, and at night, they lie under the eaves of the arcade, lined up in rows. All these miserable and helpless people are our country's young and promising compatriots. Only because of the city's decline and the depression of all industries, they have become homeless. How heartbreaking it is! Currently, they are preparing to set up several porridge factories in the port to distribute porridge to alleviate the current situation. As for the elderly and weak, they should still be sent back to their home countries. Kuala Lumpur Organizes a Relief Association: Philanthropists and chambers of commerce in Kuala Lumpur, seeing the terror of unemployment spread throughout the southern islands, have initiated the organization of an Unemployed Chinese Laborers' Relief Association, which will use the Guangdong Cemetery in the city to accommodate unemployed workers and provide them with medical care. If the government and other places have large-scale projects, they will help introduce them to work. They began to accommodate unemployed people on July 20. The number of people currently accommodated has reached more than 1,500. The future is long, and those who register continue to come in an endless stream. To seek a good solution, they are still asking philanthropists to provide assistance.</p>
<p>Relief Policies in Ipoh: The areas of Ipoh, Kampar, Gopeng, and Seremban are all tin-producing areas. If tin mining is completely suspended, the number of unemployed workers will exceed 100,000, which is a major problem. The local government of Ipoh has long considered this and is providing young and strong unemployed workers with work such as road construction and river dredging to alleviate the current situation. Those who are unable to work will be sent back to their home countries. The local government has now allocated 15,000 yuan to handle this matter. The first batch of 130 people sent back to their home countries set off on August 5.</p>
<p>The Unemployment Problem in Penang: Although Penang does not have large rubber plantations or mines, the unemployment problem is not serious, but store employees and handicraftsmen are also falling into difficult situations day by day. According to people who sent letters to the Chinese and Western newspapers in Penang, there are a total of three to four thousand unemployed people in Penang, and they are eagerly hoping that all sectors of society will come forward to provide relief. The Pingzhang Guild Hall has already recruited people to register. Those who are elderly, weak, disabled, and sick will be sent back to their home countries by the Chinese Affairs Secretary after a doctor's examination confirms it. Registration began on the 5th, and there are already more than 100 people.</p>
<p>From the above examples, the suffering of Chinese laborers in Malaya can be seen in general. However, when rubber and tin are equal to waste, and the local government restricts the entry of Chinese laborers, if you want to come south, you should first consider carefully, so that regret can be avoided.

<h3>Hoarding Silver Equals Death</h3>
<p>Aims to Create Economic Panic Among the People</p>
<p>The Russian Authorities Treat It as a Counter-Revolutionary Crime</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 21st: Russian officials say that nine people who hid large quantities of silver have been found guilty of hoarding silver coins and foreign banknotes, cash, and spreading counter-revolutionary rumors and have been shot. According to the Russian authorities' verdict on August 17, four people were sentenced to death for hoarding silver coins, and many others were also sentenced to imprisonment for hoarding silver coins. The Russian authorities are doing this because of the lack of silver coins in various parts of Russia.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 22nd: The authorities' execution of silver hoarders is part of an effort to curb popular panic. Farmers in the central provinces are particularly uneasy about the stability of paper money, resulting in some areas requiring cash for purchases, and even if paper money can be used, sellers often demand double the price. Because the authorities believe that hoarders and price-suppressing speculators aim to create economic panic, they have decided to treat these people as counter-revolutionaries.</p>

<h3>Three German Political Parties Unite</h3>
<p>Advocate for Major Administrative Reforms</p>
<p>Does Not Cooperate with the National Party</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 21st: The German National Party, the Economic Party, and the newly established Conservative Party have formed a political group in this election campaign and have issued a joint declaration advocating for major reforms in social economy, finance, and administration as fundamental conditions for national recovery. It also stated that effective solutions to the unemployment problem are essential. The trend of this group can be seen in the speech of General Fuppeck, who left the National Sovereignty Party to join the Conservative Party. Fuppek vehemently criticized the dictatorship system and strongly opposed joining hands with the National Sovereignty Party and the Baton Party in the new parliament. However, he also refused to cooperate with the Social Democratic Party and advocated that the union of the central parties is the only way to overcome the current political difficulties. As for public opinion, the right-wing press mostly expressed satisfaction with the National Party's firm decision not to cooperate with the National Party, which is dominated by the old Democratic Party. The Socialist newspapers believe that the establishment of the new group is not enough to reduce the Social Party's chances of joining the government, because the conservatives will sooner or later admit that without the active cooperation of the people belonging to the Social Democratic Party, the government will be difficult to stabilize for a long time.</p>

<h3>The Labor Strike in Northern France Takes a Sharp Turn for the Worse</h3>
<p>The Mediation of the Minister of Labor is Effective</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 21st: The labor strike in northern France is showing a sharp turn for the worse. The Lille situation has been completely resolved. The union has accepted the Minister of Labor's mediation plan. When the cost of living continues to increase, employers will increase wages again. They will resume work on Friday. In Lupers and Schooling, the situation has not yet been resolved due to the stubborn attitude of the president of the Textile Industry Federation, but many members of the association do not approve of the president's actions, and the workers are also gradually losing trust in the Communist Party. A few days ago, there was a dispute among the workers due to the Communist Party leaders' private transfer of strike relief funds to party expenses, which almost led to a riot. It was only stopped after the police were mobilized to suppress it. Therefore, the labor strike is expected to be resolved soon.</p>
<h3>Unemployed People in Germany Have Work to Do</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 21st: 125,000 unemployed people can soon find work as a result of the emergency construction order issued by the Postmaster General today. This construction project requires a total expenditure of 200 million marks and is part of the German government's plan to encourage industry and reduce prices. Therefore, the Post Office, based on the government's declaration, will not enter into contracts with factories and capital groups that refuse to generally reduce prices by 10%. It is said that other departments will also follow suit. This move is not only expected to reduce the number of unemployed people, but also to boost the people's economy and the psychological depression of financial matters.</p>

<p>Questions Will Focus on the Issue of Command Authority</p>
<p>Electric Communication Agency, Tokyo, 22nd: The Privy Council's detailed investigation committee will formally open its second meeting starting tomorrow. The questions from the investigation committee will first focus on Finance Minister Taira, namely, that he signed the treaty after abandoning the three major principles of national defense policy. As a result, Kato, the Chief of the Naval General Staff, who was responsible for national defense operations, resigned because he could not fulfill his responsibilities, which led to the replacement of the Chief of the Naval General Staff. The issue of command authority will be severely pursued. Among them, a certain investigation committee member believes that the issue of command authority is common to the army and navy and will investigate various precedents to prepare for questions.</p>
<h3>Public Telegrams</h3>
<p>Telegram from Changsha: To the respected newspaper offices, unfortunately, Hunan Province has suffered a communist disaster. After the devastation of the war, everything needs to be taken care of. After the Hunan Provincial Government formulated regulations, it selected personnel from the party, government, and military circles, as well as public legal groups, and gentry in the province to form the Hunan Post-Disaster Relief Committee, hoping to work together to achieve the effect of rescuing fire and drowning as soon as possible. We and others have been hired after surviving the disaster. We humbly believe that our talents are mediocre and cannot bear the heavy responsibility. Considering that the flames of the bandits have not been completely extinguished, the troops are still working hard to pursue and suppress them. The surviving people are looking forward to recovery, and the pacification still needs to be planned. We are deeply aware of the responsibility of every citizen and dare to shirk our responsibility as high. Therefore, we took office and established the meeting on the day of Jia. Zhang Jiong, Cao Bowen, Zhang Kailian, Fang Kejiao, Zuo Xueqian, Peng Zhaohuang, and Su Kanshi were mutually elected as standing committee members, and Peng Zhaohuang was elected as chairman. The Hunan Provincial Government also sent a wooden seal with the inscription "Seal of the Hunan Post-Disaster Relief Committee," which was respectfully put into use on this day. However, the bandit disaster is extremely serious, and it is difficult to make up for the damage. All matters related to the thorough suppression of the communist bandits, the pacification of refugees, the relief of the people's livelihood, and the stability of society are of great importance to the future of post-disaster relief. We and others have limited talents and knowledge and are deeply afraid of being unable to cope with the task. Please guide us to plan the progress. We will send the telegram immediately and pray without end. Hunan Post-Disaster Relief Committee bows and salutes. Telegram from Zhu Qinglan in Xi'an: To the Shen Bao Newspaper Office, the true telegram has been received. Yuan Chen led his colleagues to Xingping to investigate the disaster situation after the disaster and supervised the distribution of emergency relief. We returned to the province that night. Since the cold night, there has been continuous rainfall in various counties far and near. However, after a long drought, it is not easy for the withered seedlings to return. We are now purchasing buckwheat seeds for cultivation and plan to rush to the western counties of Xianxing, Liwu, Fufeng, and Mei to distribute them in preparation for replanting late autumn. After this, it rains every few days, and the locusts will die on their own. It is expected that the suffering of the disaster victims can be reduced during the harvest. At this time of year when the old harvest is gone and the new harvest has not yet arrived, it is not enough to relieve the disaster and difficulties without selecting and distributing relief in particular. We know and especially report this. Zhu Qinglan and Li Jin bow and affix their seals.</p>

<h3>Zhang Xueliang Sends a Telegram to Stop Rumors</h3>
<p>And Describes the Process of Capturing the Leaders of the Mutiny</p>
<p>Will Return to Shenyang to Take Charge After Traffic Resumes</p>
<p>Shenyang Communication: Northeast Commander-in-Chief Zhang Xueliang has been vacationing on Huludao Island since attending the groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of the port on Huludao Island, which has lasted for five decades. The weather is now getting cold. If the Beining Road was not blocked by water, Zhang could also return to Shenyang. A few days ago, Zhang went to Beidaihe to attend an appointment at the invitation of the British Naval Commander. Unexpectedly, Japan suddenly spread a rumor that Zhang had an accident in Beidaihe. The military and political authorities in Shenyang were shocked by this news and sent telegrams to Zhang's headquarters to inquire. Yesterday, Zhang himself sent a telegram to Shenyang to explain the unfounded rumors, saying that as soon as traffic resumes, he will return to Shenyang. While the railway obstruction has not been lifted, he plans to take the opportunity to inspect the garrison. Zhang has been proposing to inspect the garrison for a long time, and now, the discovery that Ma Tingfu's brigade (under Yu Xuezhong) was incited to mutiny has promoted the implementation of the previous proposal, probably to warn his subordinates. Zhang's telegram is as follows: "Confidential, I have just read the telegram from Xisheng (Rong Zhen's alias, Director of the Frontier Defense Military Affairs Office). There are many rumors in Shenyang. There have also been similar rumors in Tianjin and Beijing in recent days. I have received inquiries from various parties and have already explained them separately. Unfounded words will not be difficult to quell. Since the railway is interrupted and I cannot return to Shenyang, I plan to take this opportunity to inspect the nearby garrison. As soon as traffic resumes, I will return soon. I hope that the two brothers will take care of the military and political affairs as usual. Zhang Xueliang sealed." The above is Zhang's telegram to Rong Zhen, Director of the Frontier Defense Military Affairs Office, and Zang Shiyi, Chairman of the Provincial Government. Wang Shuchang, Director of the Military Affairs Office, and Wang Shuhan, Secretary-General, also sent a confidential telegram to Director Rong Zhen, which read, "Confidential telegram has arrived. The Commander has been in good health recently. The rumors of the past few days are not only in Shenyang, but also in Tianjin and Beijing recently. I think some good people deliberately fabricated them. I have received inquiries from various parties in recent days and have explained them separately. Unfounded words will not be difficult to quell."</p>
<p>Another communication: The Fengtian Daily News of Japan issued an extra edition on the morning of the 17th, saying that Commander-in-Chief Zhang Xueliang had an accident in Beidaihe on the 15th, but the truth is unknown. The reporter believed that the matter was of great importance and drove to the Border Defense Office to inquire. According to the internal staff of the office, Rong Zhen, Director of the Military Affairs Office of the office, and Zang Shiyi, Chairman of the Provincial Government, sent an urgent telegram to Wang Shuhan, Secretary-General of Zhang's headquarters, to inquire and requested an immediate reply. At 6:00 p.m. on the 17th, they received a telegram from Wang in Beidaihe, stating that the previous news was completely inaccurate and requested clarification and correction.</p>

<h3>Continuing Important News II</h3>
<p>In order to avoid confusing rumors, the original telegram is as follows: "Urgent, to Chairman Zang of Shenyang, President Feng Jiu, Brother Rong Ting, and Brother Xisheng, Confidential, I have received the telegram from Xian Hai. The Commander is here, in good spirits. The news in the telegram is obviously a rumor. Please clarify and correct it nearby. When the railway is repaired, the Commander will immediately return to Shenyang to quell the rumors. Younger Brother Shuhan bows in Yin Time. The Ma Tingfu Brigade, stationed in Shanhaiguan, was incited by others to plot wrongdoing. The authorities have discovered this and implemented arrests for interrogation. On the 17th, Commander Zhang Xueliang sent a Xian telegram to Shenyang, the text of which is as follows: "Urgent, to Chairman Zhang of Jilin, Chairman Kabukui of, Chairman Chengde Tang, Acting Chairman Zang of the Northeast Political Committee of Shenyang, Director Rong of the Commander-in-Chief's Office, and Chairman Zang of the Provincial Government, confidential, Tao Dunli, former advisor to the Third and Fourth Army Corps Headquarters, was Kou Yingjie's chief of staff at that time. Liang treated him with generosity and did not discriminate against him. Unexpectedly, he has been acting mysteriously recently, traveling between Yuguan and Beidaihe, inciting the army, and intending something. Brigade Commander Ma Tingfu, Regiment Commanders Meng Baifu and An Fukui, stationed in Linyu, were ignorant of righteousness and were deceived by him. Commander Yu Xiaohou has now discovered this and secretly reported it to the headquarters. On the cold day, he and Commander Yu jointly arrested Tao Dunli, Ma Tingfu, Meng Baifu, An Fukui, etc. separately in Yuguan and Beidaihe and detained them all. A military law conference is now being organized to conduct a strict interrogation to clarify Tao's background and the source of his money. The Northeast Army has always been known for its unity. If this incident is realized, it will not only disrupt military discipline but also become a laughing stock for foreigners. Fortunately, Xiaohou considered it carefully and handled it promptly, eliminating the invisible hidden dangers for the Northeast and adding great glory to the soldiers. On that day, Heaven was tired of chaos, and it was raining heavily. Without harming a soldier or breaking an arrow, the ringleaders were captured, and the evil spirit was immediately dispelled. It can be seen that those who have the Tao receive more help, and those who lose the Tao receive little help. The news from afar is deeply afraid of being untrue, so I send this telegram to inform you. Zhang Xueliang seal (19th)</p>
<h3>Details of the Central Army's Recapture of Jinan</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since Han Fuqu abandoned Jinan on June 25th and led his troops to retreat along the Jiaoji Railway, Jin army generals Zhang Yinwu, Feng Pengzhu, Zhuan Zuoyi, Li Shengda, Li Fuying, and others led their troops into Shandong, reaching as far south as Qufu and as far east as Zuoshan. Unexpectedly, in less than two months, the Central Army launched a counter-offensive from the Jinpu Railway, and the situation of the war changed suddenly. As Chiang Kwang-nai, Tsai Ting-kai, Chen Cheng, and other armies successively entered Jinan, the two-way battle came to an end. However, Shandong has been caught in a military sphere for several months, the people have been displaced, commerce has stagnated and declined, and the original vitality has been lost. The following is a description of the Jin army's withdrawal and the Central Army's entry into Jinan:</p>
<p>The Battle Situation Before the Jin Army's Withdrawal: The Central Army's counter-offensive from the Jinpu Railway was divided into three routes. Liu Zhi, the commander-in-chief of the Second Army Corps, was the commander-in-chief. The 11th Division under Chen Cheng and the 13th Division under Xia Douyin were responsible for the front of the Jinpu Railway. The teaching division under Feng Yipei was responsible for the left wing, and the 61st Division under Chiang Kwang-nai and the 60th Division under Tsai Ting-kai were responsible for the right wing. On July 9th, Liu Zhi arrived in Zou County to command the various armies to begin their northward attack. At that time, the troops defending Qufu were the 38th Brigade under Lu of the 13th Division under Xia Douyin, and the troops defending Yanzhou were the 64th Division under Ma Hongkui. The 11th Division under Chen Cheng of the frontal army was ordered to lift the siege of Qufu first. From the 10th, the two sides fought fiercely for many days in the area of ​​Konglin Sishui, Dongjiazhuang, Tuogou, Dongdacheng, and Wusuncun. On July 29th, Chen Cheng's troops advanced eastward from Wangcun, detoured to Sishui, and captured Dongshilai. A part of the troops advanced from Sishui to Yaoshan Pass Loude. On August 4th, they occupied Dawenkou and Nan Yi. The troops on the left wing went out of the road, attacked Daxinzhuang, Xiaoxinzhuang, Huangcaoling, Hongling, Wangjiatang, and Fenghuangshan from Xiaoyandi and Taipingdian, and detoured to attack Jieshou. At that time, the two divisions of Chiang Kwang-nai and Tsai Ting-kai of the right-wing army were transferred to the Jinpu Railway, bypassed Qufu, and also arrived at the right side of Dawenkou on August 4th and continued to advance north. On the 6th, they besieged Tai'an, and on the 10th, they occupied Laiwu. Then they divided into three routes and advanced north. One route went from Laiwu to Qingshiguan, one route advanced along the railway line, and one route attacked Jinan from the back road of Tai'an (this road is the old road that Li Jicai's troops used to attack Baliwa when Zhang Zongchang supervised Shandong in the 14th year of the Republic of China). The troops of Feng Yipei and others on the left wing also bypassed Wenshang and Feicheng and occupied Dongping and Dong'a. While encircling the Jin army in Wenshang and Feicheng, they attacked Changqing. The Jin army defending the Wen River, because the left and right wings of the Central Army had approached Jinan, fearing that their retreat would be cut off, ordered a retreat to the north. However, due to continuous heavy rain, the Wen River was very turbulent. When retreating, the soldiers all passed through the Dawenkou Railway Bridge. Before they had finished retreating, they hastily blew up the railway bridge, resulting in many soldiers falling into the river and being killed by the explosion. There were still thousands of Jin soldiers and more than a thousand civilians on the south bank of the Wen River. Except for those who jumped into the river, the rest were captured by the Central Army. A large number of guns and ammunition and more than fifty cars were abandoned. Because the heavy rain continued and the Wen River became more turbulent, it was difficult to cross the river, so the Central Army did not actively pursue. On August 11th, most of the Central Army had arrived on the south bank of the Wen River, and Liu Zhi himself also arrived. Then he issued a general attack order for each route. On the 13th, the 11th Division under Chen Cheng captured Jieshou, and the 8th Brigade Commander Mao Weisou of the 61st Division also advanced to the Great Wall Ridge from a small road. After two days and nights of bloody fighting with the Jin army, they occupied Zhonggongzhen, only fifty miles away from Jinan, on the evening of the 13th. On the 14th, they advanced north from Zhonggong to Dajiangou and fought fiercely with the Jin army. At the same time, Chen Cheng's troops captured Zhangxia Station, and the teaching division under Feng Yipei on the left wing also arrived at Chenjiafanpu in Changqing. The Jin troops on all routes were cut into several sections and lost contact. The Central Army was able to approach Jinan, and the Jin troops also retreated to the north.</p>
<p>The Jin Army's Withdrawal from Jinan: After the Jinpu Railway military operation was launched, the Jin army also worked very hard in the battle. However, because they initially received news of the Central Army's counter-offensive, the Central Army's actions were secret, and they could not determine the location of its main force. After many days, they still did not see the Central Army attacking north, thinking that the Central Army might be bluffing and not actually coming north. Therefore, they arranged defensive works along Sishui, Yaocun, and Wenshang, and withdrew all the troops that had attacked Qufu and Yanzhou, and changed to a defensive posture. The 18th Army under Qin Shaoguan was also transferred from the Jinpu Railway to the Jiaoji Railway to help in the battle. When the Jin army's left-wing large detour on the Jiaoji Railway was successful and advanced to Zuoshan, the news that Feng Yipei's troops of the Central Army had occupied Dong'a and Dongping on the Jinpu Railway had arrived. Before long, the news that Tai'an was besieged and Laiwu was lost came one after another. The Jin army then changed the Jiaoji Railway to a defensive posture and urgently transferred the 5th Army under Li Fuying and the 9th Army under Feng Pengzhu to the Jinpu Railway to support. After the transportation was completed, Jieshou was lost, and the large force of the Central Army had approached Jinan. They immediately ordered the 5th Army under Li Fuying to rush to Zhonggong to block the Chiang Kwang-nai's troops of the Central Army who were coming north from a small road. When Yan Xishan heard that the war on the Jinpu Railway was urgent, he secretly arrived in Jinan by special train from Taiyuan at 3:00 a.m. on the 12th and convened a meeting in Jinan with Zhang Yinwu, Zhuan Zuoyi, Feng Pengzhu, and Li Fuying. At that time, he thought that Jinan was very important. If it was abandoned, he was afraid that Zhang Xueliang would send troops and that Pingjin would not be guaranteed. Therefore, he decided to defend Jinan to the death. Yan Xishan also issued a very strict order, "No matter whether officers or soldiers retreat, they will all be shot." On the 14th, Zhonggong was lost again. At 7:00 a.m. on the same day, ten planes of the Central Army flew to Jinan and dropped bombs. Three bombs fell on the provincial government, one fell on the security team, killing two soldiers and wounding eight, one fell on the military band, killing one soldier and wounding two, one fell on the backyard kitchen, killing one cook, and one fell behind the locomotive room at Jiaoji Station, killing three children picking coal and wounding three. A small cloth bag fell at Pan Station, and two soldiers were injured when they opened it to inspect it. One fell on the Public Security Bureau of the first district in the city, injuring one patrol chief and three policemen. One fell in Xian Dong Lane, killing a Zhu woman who had come to Jinan from Dongchang to take refuge. One fell in Cang Lane, killing a Zhou Zhao woman and injuring two children. One fell on Weier Road, killing a woman. As a result, Jinan suddenly entered a state of panic. All the personnel of the agencies fled. Deng Chongxi, the acting chairman of the provincial government, moved out of the provincial government at 11:00 a.m. on the 14th, first went to the Shitaiyan Hotel for two hours, and then moved to the Social Bureau. At this time, the Jin army had prepared for a general retreat. Its Ordnance Depot first crossed the river from Luokou and retreated to Yancheng at 10:00 a.m. on the 14th. The Jin army generals also left their original locations and chose safer locations to avoid bombs. At 5:00 p.m., the Central Army had occupied Dajiangou, and the Jin army issued a general retreat order. The large force retreated from Baliwa, went straight to Luokou along Weiyi Road and over the Tianqiao Bridge, with the north bank of the Yellow River as the destination of the retreat. At the same time, the important people also ordered the station to prepare special trains separately, raising fire and waiting for departure. At 8:00 p.m. that evening, the important people of the provincial government went to the station to board the train in order to go north. However, when they arrived at the station, although the special train was there, the locomotive had been removed by the army. Just then, the rear commander Qin Jianbin received a telegram from Shi Yousan, saying that reinforcements would arrive soon and that they should not leave Jinan lightly. So he invited Deng Chongxi and the important people of the provincial government back to the Municipal Government near the station to observe the situation. On that night, the important people of the Jin side also stopped going north because they had news that reinforcements were coming and added the entire 12th Regiment of the Ninth Army of Feng Pengzhu to Baliwa to resist the Central Army coming north, and ordered the Jinpu Railway to send people to repair the power lines south of Baima Mountain. At 12:00 p.m., the battle situation at the front was actually unsustainable, but there was no definite news that reinforcements were coming. They decided to abandon Jinan. At 3:50 a.m. on the 15th, Song Kebin, the provincial committee member and director of the finance department, Nie Xiangxi, the director of the industry and commerce department, Wang Zhaoxun, the president of the high court, and the directors of various tax bureaus such as Zhu Yanzu, Shi Fengxiang, Liu Yan, Xia Yin, Zhou Shiyouyi, etc., first took the special train of the Fourth Route Army from Jinan to Dezhou. At 4:30 a.m., Gu Renfa's special train opened from Jinan North. Gu himself did not board the train. Those who took the train were Yan Xishan himself and all the personnel of his headquarters. The situation at that time was extremely secret. A stationmaster in Jinan personally saw Yan getting on the train. At 9:30 a.m., another special train opened north, which was Yan Xishan's guard car. At this time, Deng Chongxi received a secret telegram from Shi Yousan. At that time, the secret telegram had been taken to Dezhou by the confidential secretary and telegraph translator on the special train of the Fourth Route Army at 3:50 a.m. At 11:30 a.m., Bi Guangyuan, the secretary-general of the Provincial Committee, was found from a certain place and started to translate it. It was reported that the Central Army had entered the city outside the Xinjian Nanwei Gate. They hurriedly took cars to the station. At that time, there was a special train parked at the station, which was Gu Renfa's special train. Xiong Guanmin of the Provincial Committee and Lu Hongshi, the salt transport envoy, had already boarded the train first. Deng Bi and Qin Jianbin and others were anxious and had no choice but to board the train as well. The other attendants tried to have the railway bureau prepare two iron boxcars to be attached behind Gu's car and open to the north together. Unexpectedly, before the two cars could be attached, the Central Army had arrived at the station. Gu and others were in a very urgent situation and had no choice but to abandon the iron boxcars and hurriedly opened their car to the north. As a result, a part of the provincial government officials were all captured. At that time, the Central Army that first arrived at the station was only about twenty people. They fired two shots to show their power. It was about 12:00 noon. There were still four or five thousand Jin troops at the station, but they were in a panic and fled. Zhuan Zuoyi came to Jinan from Baima Mountain at 3:00 a.m. on the 15th and parked his special train at Dahuai Tree. Zhang Yinwu, Feng Pengzhu, Li Fuying, and others all boarded the train at Dahuai Tree and drove to Jinpu Station at 6:00 a.m. to discuss military affairs on the train. When the Central Army arrived at the station, they hurriedly drove north in the chaos of gunfire at 12:00 noon. It can be said that it was dangerous that they were not captured. Later, a train of the Fourth Route Army came from the Jiaoji Railway and opened from Jinan North. The time was 12:20 p.m. Then a train of supplies, a train of ammunition, a train of the transportation office, and a train of airplanes opened north one after another. Zhang Jianwu, the commander of transportation, was killed by a bomb when he got out of the car to direct the departure of the train. After Wang Yijing, the director of the Jinan Municipal Public Security Bureau, heard the Jin army's general retreat order, he appointed Chief Inspector Dou Shixi to act as the director of the Public Security Bureau. He left the bureau at 3:00 p.m. on the 14th and moved to another place. At 11:30 a.m. on the 15th, someone saw him pass through Weiyi Road by car. At 12:00 noon, Wang heard that the Central Army had entered Jinan and hurriedly took a car to the station, wanting to take Gu Renrenfa's special train to the north. But as soon as he arrived at the station, Gu's car had already left, and the Central Army had also arrived at the station. Wang then took a car through the Jinpu Bridge tunnel in the chaos, went out of Guan Zha Camp, and went to Luokou. Unexpectedly, when he arrived at Sunkong Bridge, the car got stuck in the mud due to continuous white rainy days and could not move. At this time, several soldiers of the Central Army saw the car and had rushed over. Wang saw that the situation was urgent and got out of the car and hid in the valley. Because it was daytime, it was difficult to hide, and he was finally arrested. Liu Xihui, the director of the Finance Bureau who was in the same car with Wang, was shot and killed as soon as he got out of the car. It was also heard that before the Jin army retreated to the south, Song Kebin, the director of the Finance Department of the Provincial Government, borrowed 360,000 yuan from the China Communications Bank, Shanghai Industrial Bank, and Fourth Bank in Jinan.</p>
<p>The Situation After the Central Army Entered Jinan: Before the Jin army had completely withdrawn, Liao Qilong, the battalion commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 16th Regiment of the 8th Brigade of the 61st Division, the vanguard of the Central Army, entered the city from Baliwa through Qianfoshan and from the Nanwei Gate (Xinjian Gate) at 11:40 a.m. on the 15th. A part of them were stationed in the Provincial Government, and a part of them went to the station along Weiyi Road to pursue the Jin army. However, after the Central Army entered the commercial port and arrived at the station, the Jin army had not completely retreated, and conflicts occurred between the two sides. The Japanese residents in Jinan pretended to be panic and gathered at the Gengshen Club, Jinan Hospital, and Ordinary Higher Elementary School to take refuge. At 2:00 p.m., the sound of gunfire was no longer heard in the commercial port area, and the main forces of the 61st Division, 60th Division, and 11th Division of the Central Army entered Jinan one after another. As a result, the Central Army gathered in Jinan. At 2:10 p.m. on the same day, Chiang Kwang-nai, the commander-in-chief of the right wing and the commander of the 61st Division, led all the personnel of the division headquarters and the party affairs personnel sent by the Central Party Department to the war zone from Zhonggong to Jinan. The division headquarters was set up in that place. At 3:00 p.m., Tsai Ting-kai, the commander of the 60th Division, also led the personnel of the division headquarters to Jinan. The division headquarters was set up in the Yanwuting. At 3:30 p.m., Chen Cheng, the commander of the 11th Division, also led the personnel of the division headquarters to Jinan and stayed at the Jinpu Railway Hotel. Chiang Kwang-nai was ordered by Chiang Kai-shek to concurrently serve as the Jinan Garrison Commander and issued a notice to appease the people in the name of the Garrison Commander. On this day, due to the sudden change in the situation, the vehicles on the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways were completely suspended. The telegraph lines between Jinan and Tianjin were also cut off at 12:30 a.m. on the 15th, and all traffic in Jinan was completely cut off. Only one radio station could communicate with the outside world, but military telegrams were crowded, commercial telegrams were backlogged, and news telegrams could not be sent at all.</p>
<p>War News from Various Routes After the Central Army Entered Jinan: After the Central Army captured Jinan, it continued to advance towards Luokou. At 2:30 p.m. on the 15th, it arrived near various ports. At this time, the special trains of the important people of the Jin side had passed the Yellow River Railway Bridge to the north one after another. However, there were still three or four thousand soldiers and four or five trains of ammunition and supplies south of the railway bridge. Seeing that the pursuers of the Central Army had arrived, they hurriedly went north. The soldiers fired and resisted while crossing the river, resulting in many people falling into the water. One train of ammunition derailed in the middle of the bridge and overturned, and other trains could not go north. As a result, by the morning of the 16th, the Jin army had finished crossing the river. More than a thousand soldiers surrendered and handed over their weapons, and more than twenty trains of ammunition, eighty trains of supplies and military supplies, four airplanes, and three locomotives were abandoned. On the same day, the locomotive was used to haul the ammunition and supply trains to Jinan and parked at the Jinpu Station. After the Jin army abandoned Jinan, the 3rd Army under Wang Jingguo, which was defending the Jiaoji Railway, also concentrated near Zhoucun at the same time and withdrew towards Qingcheng in order to cross the river north from Qingcheng again. As a result, the Jiaoji Railway was restored to Han Fuqu. Most of Han's army entered Qingzhou on the 15th, and Sun Tongxuan's troops advanced from Qingzhou to Zhangdian Village, Pujii Zaoyuan, Mingshui, and other places on the 16th, while Cao Fulin's troops guarded Qingzhou and were responsible for pursuing the Jin army towards Qingcheng. The Jin army in Changqing also retreated north across the Yellow River on the 15th and 16th. The Shandong battle came to an end. However, there were still two regiments of the Jin army in Tai'an City, and there were still two brigades of the Jin army in Wenshang and Feicheng. However, their contact had been cut off, and it was quite difficult to persist. On the morning of the 17th, Tsai Ting-kai and Chen Cheng led their troops north, intending to cross the Yellow River north from Qihe, Luokou, and other places. Chiang Kwang-nai, in addition to leaving a part to garrison Jinan, also advanced towards Luokou. As of the 18th, there was still artillery fire in the Luokou area, and the two armies were fighting across the river. The 2nd Army of the 30th Route of the Jin Army, Shi Fengming's troops in Zhoucun, were defeated by the local militia on the 15th and retreated to Changshan County. Yuan Jufeng, the director of the Zhoucun Public Security Bureau, Li Xiantang, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and Li Baoheng, the head of the defense group, had a telegram to Jinan on the 17th, reporting everything to Chiang Kwang-nai.</p>
<p>Important People of the Central Army Arrived in Jinan One After Another: After the Central Army recaptured Jinan, important people arrived in Jinan one after another. At 10:30 a.m. on the morning of the 16th, Liu Zhi, the commander-in-chief of the Second Army Corps, arrived in Jinan from Nan Honggou Village in Tai'an with Chief of Staff Liu Yaoyang, Adjutant Wang Zunwu, and personnel from eight major departments. He convened a military meeting at the Jinpu Railway Hotel with Chiang Kwang-nai, Tsai Ting-kai, Chen Cheng, and others to discuss the strategy of crossing the river to pursue the Jin army. The meeting ended at 4:00 p.m. Chiang and Tsai returned to their division headquarters, and Liu Zhi continued to discuss military affairs with Chen Cheng. On the same day, Liu Zhi set up the headquarters of the Second Army Corps in the Municipal Government, and he stayed there.

<p>and editing section of the Public Security Bureau who had been imprisoned. At 5:00 p.m., Xia Douyin also arrived in Jinan by car from Changqing. At 10:30 a.m. on the morning of the 17th, the reporter went to see Liu Zhi at the headquarters of the Second Army Corps. Liu made the following statement, "When the Jin army took advantage of the fact that the Central Army and Feng Yuxiang's army were fighting fiercely on the Longhai Road, they attacked Jinan. Han Xiangfang (Fuqu) abandoned Jinan and retreated to the Jiaoji Railway because he was outnumbered. At the same time, Ma Shaoyun (Hongkui) also retreated south from Tai'an. This time, our army counter-attacked from the Jinpu Railway and was divided into three routes. Each route had more than four divisions. Each route made rapid progress and occupied Dawenkou on August 4th. The Jin army was in a panic and retreated. Because the Wen River was turbulent, they all had to pass through the railway bridge, resulting in countless people falling into the river. A large number of guns, ammunition, and supplies were abandoned, and more than a thousand people were captured. Because of the continuous heavy rain, our army did not actively advance north. On the 11th, our army issued a general attack order for each route, and Jinan was recaptured in just four or five days. On the morning of the 17th, three or four divisions of our army had crossed the river from Luokou to pursue the Jin army. At the same time, a part of the troops was sent to the Jiaoji Railway to jointly attack the remnants of the Jin army with Han's army. There was still a regiment of the Jin army in Tai'an City, and there were also parts of the Jin army in Wenshang and Feicheng. They have all been surrounded by our army and have sent people to negotiate surrender. It is expected that it will be resolved soon. According to the report of Zhang Huichang, the director of the Aviation Administration, our army's planes dropped bombs in Yancheng and destroyed Zhuan Zuoyi's special train. Only the foremost first-class blue steel car was not bombed. Except for all being destroyed, it is unknown whether Zhuan has been in danger." Also, Qian Dajun, the commander of the Teaching Division, arrived in Jinan at 3:00 p.m. on the 17th and returned to Hankou on the 18th. Han Houqu, the commander-in-chief of the First Army Corps, also came to Jinan from Qingzhou at 1:10 p.m. on the 17th with his Chief of Staff Zhang Yue, Chief of Staff Zhao Guangpei, Operations Section Chief Jia Benjia, and Chiang Bocheng, the chief adviser of the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Regarding the security of Jinan, Liu had appointed his adjutant Wang Zunwu as the director of the Jinan Public Security Bureau. Wang took office at the bureau at 7:00 a.m. on the 18th. Huang Shang, the director of the ordnance factory, was also appointed by Liu Zhi and took office on the 17th. At 8:00 a.m. on the 18th, Liu Zhi received Jinan newspaper reporters at the Second Army Corps Headquarters and gave a lengthy speech. As for the traffic on the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways, the bridges are being repaired urgently. The Jinpu Railway has a huge break in the Dawenkou Railway Bridge and will be opened in sections first. The Liuhe Bridge on the Jiaoji Railway was repaired at 6:00 p.m. on the 19th and will be opened on the 20th. Kaga Yama Manabu, the Japanese director of the Jiaoji Railway Vehicle Department, Tan Shukui, the deputy director, Cai Guozhao, the director of the Machinery Department, and Deng, the director of the Engineering Department, arrived in Jinan from Qingdao by special train at 12:00 noon on the 19th.

It was heard that Wang Yijing, the director of the Public Security Bureau, had committed suicide in the ordnance factory.</p>
<p>The Provincial Government Moved from Qingdao to Jinan: The Shandong Provincial Government moved to Qingdao on June 25th. Now that Jinan has been recaptured, they took a special train from Qingdao at 3:00 a.m. on the 19th.

<h3>Measures to Prohibit the Import of Chinese Laborers</h3>
<p>A Trial Period of Three Months</p>
<p>Only Allowed to Land in Singapore and Penang</p>
<p>Penang Correspondence: The Straits Settlements government announced on July 31st that it would prohibit Chinese laborers from landing on the Malay Peninsula within three months, which has a huge impact on our country's labor sector. The implementation measures are very strict. Singapore is the gateway to the Malay Peninsula, not only a must-pass place for Chinese expatriates from our country to the Malay Peninsula, but also a hub for Eurasian transportation. Now, the import of Chinese laborers is prohibited. It has been announced that all adult Chinese laborers who move from China will be calculated in Singapore. After the calculation, they can be transferred to Penang to land. The work of calculating the number of entries is handled by the Port Service Officer, and one person is sent by the Chinese Protector to help. Laborers who are not allowed to enter other ports other than Singapore and Penang are not allowed to land. Chinese laborers who land in Penang must also be calculated in Singapore. If they do not follow the above measures and attempt to land in other ports, they will be immediately arrested. It is said that the reasons are: (1) The Malay Peninsula is entirely an industrial area, and if the import of Chinese laborers is completely prohibited, it will have an impact; (2) If the shipping companies that travel between Hong Kong, Shantou, and Xiamen stop carrying passengers, they may go bankrupt; (3) At this time of commercial warfare competition, it is difficult to be self-satisfied and not interact with other markets. Due to these three reasons, the Straits Settlements government has stipulated a trial period of three months as a workaround. Each month, 5,000 Chinese laborers are allowed to be imported and distributed to various shipping companies for transportation. However, the losses suffered by the shipping companies due to the ban on Chinese labor are quite large. During these three months of restrictions, in order to prevent losses, they may increase fares in order to make up for their losses. (August 8th)</p>

<p>County Government Requests Maintenance of Education Funds: The County Education Bureau of this county previously submitted the budget for the county-run middle school, county-run normal school, and primary schools at all levels for the 19th year. It was ordered to review and reduce it. Upon hearing this news, all schools found it difficult to maintain operations and collectively tendered their resignations. The school principals also passed a resolution on this matter in a joint meeting. This matter came to the attention of the county government, which specifically raised it for discussion at the 71st county administrative meeting yesterday (the 21st). It was unanimously agreed that the cost of living has been continuously increasing in recent years, and various school expenses have increased several times compared to the past. If the budget is cut, it will indeed be difficult. It was resolved that the county government would forward the original proposal to the Department of Education, requesting its maintenance to demonstrate understanding and consideration.</p>
<p>Reduction of Administrative Expenses for District Offices: The Civil Affairs Department of this province previously issued regulations on the operation of district offices, stipulating that district administrative expenses should not exceed one-third of the business expenses.

<p>Anti-Smuggling Unit Engages in Fierce Battle with Salt Smugglers: The Second Company of the Seventh Anti-Smuggling Brigade, stationed in Tangkou Town, received a tip on the evening of the 20th that a large group of over 40 salt smugglers, aboard 13 Ningbo open boats, were fully loaded with over 1,000 loads of smuggled salt and were engaged in sales in Jialingtang, on the border of Xiyu, carrying quick-firing guns and Mauser pistols. Upon receiving the report, Company Commander Li Chuquan immediately led a team of elite soldiers to apprehend them the following morning. As soon as they arrived at Xiadian Bridge, the smugglers, seeing the arrival of government troops, immediately laid ambushes and opened fire to resist arrest for a long time without a clear outcome. At that time, patrol boats stationed in Tangkou, upon hearing that government troops had already opened fire, immediately dispatched five boats to assist. Unable to withstand the pressure, the smugglers, led by their leader, began to retreat towards Yuanshan Tang River. Several smugglers were killed on the spot, and countless were wounded. However, all the bodies were seized and taken away. On the official side, Patrol Leader Liu Chun of Patrol Boat No. 6 and Zhang Guoyi, helmsman of Patrol Boat No. 1, died heroically in action after being stabbed by the smugglers' knives. Patrol Leader Ma Hongbin of Patrol Boat No. 7 and Shi Renyi, helmsman of Patrol Boat No. 1, were both wounded in the legs by bullets. Company Commander Li ordered the transfer of the remains of Liu and Zhang back to Tangkou for encoffining, and the wounded Ma and Shi were immediately sent to Puren Hospital in the city for treatment.</p>
<p>Hunan Refugees Cause Disturbances While Passing Through: Since Changsha, Hunan, was ravaged by the Communists, people have been fleeing to various places to survive. The town of Daqiangmen in Wuxi County was visited by over 200 Hunan refugees the other day, entering from Kunshan via Changshu. The leader carried a passport issued by Kunshan County and requested 3.7 shi of rice and $12 from the 12th District. District Chief Tu Keqiang, seeing that the leader was wearing a white gauze long shirt and a gold watch, found it suspicious and immediately gave him $15 to buy rice himself. He also reported to the 11th Sub-bureau of the Houzhai Public Security Bureau and the Chamber of Commerce for temporary vigilance. By the next morning, the refugees had left the town towards Changshu. However, in the afternoon, a large number of refugees carrying firearms arrived in Wengjia Village and Xuedian in the district and caused extensive disturbances. The homes of Weng Wenxiang and a few other families were robbed. Upon receiving the report, the 11th Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau not only dispatched teams to suppress the situation but also reported to the County Public Security Bureau and the County Government for instructions on how to handle the matter.</p>
<p>Dismissal of County Police Captain: Zhu Zhenguo, the Captain of the County Police Brigade, was repeatedly accused by the people to the Provincial Department, resulting in a pile of accumulated cases. The County Government had previously been ordered to investigate. Recently, Ding and others filed accusations with the Civil Affairs Department. After Minister Hu of the Civil Affairs Department sent personnel to Wuxi to secretly investigate and verify the accusations, he specifically instructed the County Government to dismiss Zhu Zhenguo from his post and to hand over the official seals, firearms, ammunition, and files by a specific date. Wang Wei has been appointed to Wuxi to succeed him.</p>

He then went to the County Government and the Party Headquarters to discuss office space and funding issues. It was decided that the office would be located in the former Farmers' Association. As for funding, due to the failure to collect the land tax for agricultural improvement, there was no solution. Director Xu went to the province on the 22nd to ask Director He of the Department of Agriculture and Mining for instructions.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Zhazeh Station Relocated to Qiaotou: Zhazeh Station, located about nine li from Zhenjiang, has been established for a long time. However, due to its remote location, there are few travelers. On the other hand, Qiaotou Town, between Gaozi and Xiashu, has established San Gao School and a farm, with more frequent travelers. Therefore, the Ministry of Railways ordered the directors of the two railway administrations to immediately relocate Zhazeh Station to Qiaotou to facilitate travel. After receiving the order, the directors are reported to be preparing to abolish Zhazeh Station and establish a new station in Qiaotou Town soon.</p>

The bureau dispatched police officers to the scene and caught eleven gamblers and three mahjong sets, taking them all to the bureau. Just as they were preparing to hold a preliminary hearing, a mob of several hundred people went to the bureau, swarming inside. The police officers were unable to stop them, and the arrested gamblers were snatched away. Later, Chairman Guan of the Chamber of Commerce intervened to mediate, and they dispersed.

<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Fifth District Inspector Investigates Opium Case: The patrol boat of the Fortress Headquarters seized 19 catties of opium at Liuwei Port in the Yangtze River on the 16th and arrested opium traffickers Qiu Zanqing, boatman Pan Rongfu, and waterway police officers Chen Bingquan and Liu Hanbing. Yang, the Commander, and Li, the County Magistrate, jointly held a military trial and telegraphed the Civil Affairs Department for instructions. They received a reply, ordering them to be dealt with severely according to the law. Jiang Chaoxiong, the Fifth District Chief, appointed Tao Fengwei to investigate in Cheng yesterday (the 20th). Tao investigated at the County Government, the County Party Headquarters, and the Chamber of Commerce. The County Government copied a transcript of the confession and brought it to the district headquarters for study. Tao believes that the facts of this case are confirmed and cannot be clarified in a short period of time and require detailed investigation. Consultations with various agencies generally yielded the same results as reported in the newspapers. Tao is scheduled to return to the province on the 21st. The officers of the 20th Squadron of the Water Police Brigade believe that the opium case is of great importance, affecting the reputation of the entire team. They are studying several issues related to this case: (1) Whether military trials can be applied to this case. (2) Whether torture can be used during the preliminary hearing. (3) Whether instruments of torture can be used for public sentencing. (4) Whether confessions obtained under torture can be used as legitimate testimony. (5) Whether torture involves acts of violence, coercion, or fraud. The above-mentioned issues should be judged by the district committee with a legal and fair attitude. In short, the content of this case is complex and difficult to resolve thoroughly.</p>

<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Burglary in Tushan Tou, Zhapu: The home of the Qian Guansi clerk in Tushan Tou, outside the West Gate of Zhapu, was suddenly attacked at 1:00 AM last night by more than ten bandits speaking with a northern accent. Armed with knives and clubs, they broke down the door and tied up all the men, women, and children in the family. They lit kerosene lamps and burned the clerk's arms, forcing him to reveal the location of the hidden silver. Unable to endure the pain, he handed over all the 80 silver dollars he had accumulated. The bandits also ransacked the clothes, chests, and baskets. They only left at dawn with whoops and calls. Tushan Tou is located near Zhapu City and has been robbed five or six times.</p>
<p>Dead Body Revived by Electric Shock: At the home of a farmer surnamed Zheng outside the North Gate of Zhapu, the father and son had an argument due to minor family matters the other day, which led the son to commit suicide. He hanged himself in the evening. The family discovered and rescued him, but it was too late. Unexpectedly, last night, there was a thunderstorm. A thunderbolt struck the body of the hanged man and revived him. The whole family was overjoyed and celebrated the revival. The corpse is now moving as usual. When asked about what happened after death, he was completely ignorant. It is often heard that living people die from electric shock, but it has never been heard of a dead body being revived by electric shock. This matter is worth studying by scientists.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Xupoqiao Town Robbed: Xupoqiao Town in the southern part of Jiaxing is a small market town with rows of shops and a large population. Because of its remote location, there had been no disturbances for decades. But at about 6:00 PM on August 20th, forty or fifty bandits were suddenly discovered patrolling the streets of the town. The townspeople initially did not care because there was no defense by water or land police or self-defense corps, so they had to let nature take its course. After a while, the bandits fired shots to demonstrate their strength and began to guard the town in various directions, starting to rob each household. None of the merchants and residents with some wealth were spared. At the same time, a townsman named Zhang Shenghe was shot by the bandits, and many others were injured with wooden sticks. The robbery lasted three or four hours before they left with their loot. The wounded have been sent to the hospital for treatment. Townspeople Hu Ganqing and Zhou Pengshou went to the city at noon on the 21st to report the robbery to the county government.

<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Resolving the Surplus Rice After the Suspension of Grain Sales: The Shaoxing Grain and Wheat Maintenance Association had previously transported over 10,000 packages to Shaoxing for price stabilization sales. Because of the new grain season and abundant harvests, rice prices fell, and there was no need for price stabilization sales. The association decided to suspend sales and distribute the surplus rice to rice merchants for sale. Because the agreed price differed from the market price, it was difficult to persuade people to buy, and the surplus rice has not yet been sold. The association decided that the county should convene a joint meeting of rice merchants from various towns and townships at the County Chamber of Commerce at 11:00 AM on the 23rd to appropriately reduce the price on the spot and instruct each leader to purchase the grain immediately and pay on a daily basis in order to find a solution. County Magistrate Tang sent letters to the rice merchants in various towns and townships yesterday, requesting them to attend the meeting to discuss a solution.</p>
<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>Jailbreaker and Thief Caught: Hu Acai, a habitual thief, escaped from prison in 1928 due to the negligence of former official Zhu. Although a reward was offered for his arrest, he was not caught. In the past two years, the fugitive has committed numerous major crimes in the urban and rural areas. As the arrest became more urgent, he fled to Daoxu in Shaoxing.

He was arrested and sent to the county government for interrogation. He has now been shackled and imprisoned. The county government has also awarded the squad leader a reward of 20 yuan to encourage him.</p>
<p>Adulterous Woman and Lover Beat Her Husband: Xia Ayu, the wife of Gong Achen, a fried food vendor in the East Gate of the city, has been living with Gong for more than ten years and has given birth to two children. However, this year, Xia Ayu suddenly changed her attitude and became acquainted with Luo Huanwen, an internal affairs officer of the County Public Security Bureau. They went in and out without avoiding the eyes of neighbors and her husband. Achen was afraid of his power as an officer of the Public Security Bureau and could do nothing. At the beginning of this month, Xia secretly ran away and lived with Luo in the Tangzong Temple in the same district, publicly declaring that she had paid 60 yuan to divorce her husband. On the 19th, Achen went to his wife's residence to persuade her to return. After an argument, Xia shouted at the neighbors Ge and tailor Wang, among others, to beat him, causing Achen's head, face, arms, and other parts to bleed profusely. Passersby felt indignant and wrote a complaint on his behalf, requesting assistance from the County Party Headquarters.</p>

<p>Fraud Case Cracked: The Xingyuan Money Shop in Gongqian City was defrauded of over 270 yuan on the 18th of this month by a monk who had returned to secular life, Chen Taoyue, who forged the seal of Chen Lifang of the Chen Shuntai Southern Goods Store in Shenjiamen. The case remained unsolved. Unexpectedly, Chen Taoyue used the forged seal again yesterday to defraud the shop of money. He was recognized by an apprentice from the He Zhenfeng Silk Shop, who reported it to the investigation team, who arrested the fraudster and took him to the team for investigation.</p>

<h3>Wang Jiazhen Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Stated that the Northeast's Attitude Remains Consistent</p>
<p>Scheduled to Go to Beijing Tomorrow Evening to Return to Duty</p>
<p>Wang Jiazhen, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, returned from Liaonan with his family, stopping briefly in Qingdao. He arrived in Shanghai on the Fengtian Maru at 4:30 PM yesterday and landed at the Huangpu Wharf. Those who went to welcome him included Chen Shiguang, the Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Director Liu Yunfang, and over a dozen of Wang's relatives and friends. This reporter interviewed him at his residence yesterday, and his remarks are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Mayor of Qingdao: Wang said that Hu Ruoyu originally planned to go to Qingdao around the 10th to assume the position of Mayor. At that time, I was waiting for Hu in Huludao to come from Tianjin to go together. Unexpectedly, the Beining Railway was impassable due to flooding. I waited for Hu for a long time without his arrival, so I returned to Yingkou and transferred to Liaonan. Hu is currently handling family affairs in Tianjin and is expected to go to Qingdao soon. When asked if it was true that Zhang Xueming would be appointed as the Qingdao Garrison Commander, he replied that Zhang would accompany Hu south, but the specific position he would hold had not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Attitude of the Northeast: When asked about the recent attitude of the Northeast and when Mayor Zhang would return south, Wang said that he did not want to express any opinions on political issues. All he could say was that the Northeast's attitude has remained consistent. The date of Mayor Zhang's return south is still uncertain. He thought he had already returned to Liaoning with Commander Zhang.</p>
<p>Sino-Russian Negotiations: Wang also said that regarding the Sino-Russian negotiations, he met with the Russian Consul in Liaoning and learned that the progress of both sides was smooth. He spent some time in Liaoning because he was finishing up various unfinished matters from his previous term. He also went to the border between Korea and Yanji to investigate the situation of Korean immigrants in the Northeast. After returning to Liaoning, he hurried south.</p>
<p>Going to Beijing Tomorrow Evening: Wang also said that this time, his wife and maid were not used to sailing. After arriving in Qingdao, they were extremely exhausted and rested at the hotel for four days before coming to Shanghai. He plans to meet with Foreign Minister Wang this morning and take a train to Beijing tomorrow evening to return to duty. When asked about his opinion on the North Daihe news spread by foreign news agencies, he replied that foreign reporters are not familiar with the situation in China and easily spread rumors and make mistakes. Therefore, he strongly advocates that all news should be provided to domestic reporters first and that they should be approached frequently. However, Chinese people often like to be close to foreign reporters, which is very inappropriate.</p>
<p>National Government Telegraph</p>
<h3>Urging Chen Xizeng to Take Office</h3>
<p>Director Chen Expresses Further Consideration</p>
<p>Chen Xizeng, the newly appointed Director of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC), presented his resignation to the National Government after receiving the formal commission, because he deemed that the CMSNC's future was very important, and he was not able to take on such responsibility, and it was inconsistent with his values, and it was incumbent upon him to offer his resignation. It is reported that the Secretariat of the National Government telegraphed yesterday, urging him to take office quickly. The original telegram is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram from the Secretariat of the National Government: Shanghai Telegraph Bureau forwards to Director Chen Xizeng of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Please see and consider. The Chairman has instructed that shipping is important and needs to be reorganized urgently. You are expected to take office quickly, endeavor to overcome the difficulties, and there is no need for concern. Secretariat of the National Government.</p>
<p>Chen Xizeng's Talk: A reporter from New Voice News learned of the telegram from the Secretariat, urging Chen to take office quickly, and went to visit Chen to ask for his opinion. According to Chen, he serves the party and the country with a fact-based approach. So long as it benefits the party and the country, he is not be afraid of any difficulties. This time, he has been suddenly appointed as the Director of the CMSNC. However, it is very important, and if he has no confidence in how to fix this, he would be unqualified for this task. In addition, the financial difficulties of the company need to be carefully addressed. Therefore, with the telegram from the National Government, he has to further consider this matter.</p>
<p>Statement from the Transportation Authorities: A reporter from New Voice News in Beijing visited the transportation authorities on the issue of Chen Xizeng's resignation as Director of the CMSNC. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Communications, the reorganization of the CMSNC cannot be achieved overnight and requires time and careful planning. Chen's resignation is not due to any major reason. He feels that a prolonged delay would bankrupt the company, so he would rather step aside for someone more capable. However, the Ministry has not yet received his official resignation document. Even if Chen insists on resigning, the National Government and the Ministry of Communications will try to retain him. The difficulty of the CMSNC is not in the duties but in the entire economic problem of the company. The organization and content of the CMSNC will be improved. Minister of Communications Wang Boqun has determined that the company will be jointly operated by the government and merchants. As the situation stabilizes, merchants investing in enterprises and the government subsidizing the development of transportation will be able to advance together. Currently, foreign ships are increasingly encroaching on navigation rights in the Yangtze River. If domestic ships are not protected and encouraged, inland waterway rights will be lost to foreigners without a fight. It is also heard that the Ministry of Communications has drafted a plan to reorganize the CMSNC and will submit it to the Central Political Conference for discussion after consulting with all parties. As for Chen's resignation, the Ministry of Communications believes that it will be able to overcome the difficulties.</p>

<p>Sandetang Appoints Arbitrator</p>
<p>Preliminary Exchange of Views Begins Yesterday</p>
<p>Regarding the Jin Li Yuan Wharf case of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, it is reported that the French Sandetang (a charitable organization) formally sent a letter to lawyer Gao Shuo yesterday, appointing an arbitrator to conduct arbitration. Yesterday afternoon, the two arbitrators had already begun discussions. The reporter from the "New Voice News" (新聲社) has learned the details of the matter and will report them as follows:</p>
<p>Sandetang Appoints Arbitrator Lawyer Ba He, representing Sandetang, has sent a letter to lawyer Gao Shuo, notifying him that Ya Mina has been appointed as the arbitrator. The original letter stated: "1. Sandetang has received your bureau's notification that lawyer Gao Shuo has been appointed as the arbitrator for the Jin Li Yuan Wharf case. Our office has also appointed Song Ya Mina as the arbitrator. Mr. Ya is residing at No. 25 Gongguan Road. The letter of appointment has been issued. Please check and liaise with him."

He also requested lawyer Gao to prepare a written opinion to be submitted to the French Concession for adoption. Lawyer Gao Shuo immediately stated that the case had already departed from legal resolution and was proceeding with arbitration, so there was no need to prepare a written opinion for the French Concession. Mr. Ya said that this was solely for the sake of preserving the dignity of the French Concession and requested that it be followed. Lawyer Gao said that he would seriously consider this and requested that Mr. Ya first provide the written opinion for review. Mr. Ya scheduled to deliver it to Lawyer Gao this morning. The two discussed for over an hour.</p>

<p>After the Lifting of the Ban on Hunan Rice</p>
<h3>Large Quantities to Be Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Various Shipping Companies Rush to Load</p>
<p>Hunan province is a rice-producing region. In the past, the amount of rice transported to Shanghai each year was very large. In recent years, due to poor harvests, the Hunan authorities banned the export of grain, and Hunan rice ceased to arrive in Shanghai. This year, there is a bumper harvest, and the Hunan authorities have lifted the ban on grain exports. Hunan rice, which has not been seen for several years, is once again being shipped to Shanghai. The First Batch of Hunan Rice Arrives in Shanghai After the Hunan army recovered the provincial capital, the residents were almost completely gone, and the government agencies were short of funds. The Provincial Government Committee decided that this year's Hunan province harvest is the best in over ten years. After providing for the province's own consumption, there is a surplus of rice that can be sold to other provinces. Therefore, it was decided to lift the ban, and the Hunan government will collect a certain amount of export permit fees per stone (unit of weight). After the decision, the grain merchants in Shanghai were notified and the first day of lifting the ban was August 22nd. Shanghai grain merchants have already telegraphed Hunan to place orders. The first batch to be shipped to Shanghai: yesterday, a local shipping company received information that over 1,000 bags have been shipped. The remaining large quantities will be loaded and shipped continuously.</p>
<p>Rushing to Send River Boats for Transport Hunan rice export brings a large transportation business opportunity. Upon hearing the news, various shipping companies in Shanghai are rushing to send ships to compete for loading. British Taikoo Dockyard Company has already dispatched four ships in the Changsha line, coordinating with Changjiang Shipping in Hankou to load this rice. Nissin Kisen Kaisha is also using four ships to carry the rice. On the Chinese side, Sanbei Shipping Company plans to send the Hongheng ship directly to Shanghai and Hunan, specifically to carry Hunan rice to Shanghai, and is also discussing it. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will send the Liji ship, towing a large number of barges to Hankou, and then transshipping to Shanghai. It is expected that Hunan rice will arrive in Shanghai within the next week.</p>
<h3>Jiangjing and Daji Collide on Tongzhou River</h3>
<p>Both Ships Damaged and Sent to Shanghai for Repairs</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Changjiang River ship Jiangjing was sailing from Hankou to Shanghai. Yesterday morning at 5:30 AM, when it reached the Tongzhou river, it happened to encounter the Dada Company's Tongyang Line ship Daji, which had also weighed anchor from Tongzhou to Shanghai. At that time, Jiangjing was in front and Daji was behind, but the Daji suddenly accelerated, trying to overtake the Jiangjing. When the Daji was trying to overtake, the two ships became parallel, the Daji suddenly collided with the Jiangjing's front. The Jiangjing, seeing the fierce attack, attempted to evade it by accelerating forward, but it was too late. The bow of the Jiangjing was violently struck by the Daji, causing significant damage. The front of the Daji also suffered damage. Both ships immediately sailed to Shanghai, arriving at the port at 11 AM. Each reported to their headquarters and requested the customs river transport department to send personnel in the afternoon to inspect the losses of the two ships, investigate the faults of both parties, and determine a solution. The Jiangjing was originally scheduled to export today, but now needs to be repaired and its departure has been suspended. The Daji also needs to be repaired before it can sail.</p>
<h3>Whereabouts of Prominent Figures</h3>
<p>Zhu Lühe, Minister of Judicial Administration, left Beijing by express train at 5 PM yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at around 12 AM the same night.</p>
<p>Liu Jiwen, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, left Beijing by night train last night and is expected to arrive here around 7 AM this morning.</p>
<p>Increased Customs Fees</p>
<h3>Additional Tax on Purchase of Clearance and Cargo Release Permits</h3>
<p>Great Panic Among Shipping Companies</p>
<p>The customs recently received an order from the Inspector General of Customs that, starting from September 12th of this year, all requests for purchasing clearance and cargo release permits after 6 PM, on Sundays, and holidays, will be subject to an 80% increase in fees. Upon hearing the news, shipping companies in this port are in great panic, frowning and complaining. They have already reported to the Shipping Association, requesting that the authorities be urgently approached to negotiate and revoke the order to ease the burden. It is reported that the Shipping Association has separately presented the suffering of shipping merchants to the Ministry of Finance and the Inspector General of Customs, earnestly requesting the restoration of the original tax rate. It is unknown whether the authorities will revoke the order.</p>
<h3>Flour Exports Have Not Yet Disappeared</h3>
<p>The market price of flour has been rising sharply in recent days, and the Bureau of Social Affairs has issued an order for investigation. According to customs news yesterday, since the central government issued an order prohibiting flour exports to Tianjin, customs inspections have been very strict, and exports have virtually disappeared. However, greedy merchants are still secretly smuggling flour for export. The destination has been changed to Qingdao, Zhifu, Niuzhuang, Qinhuangdao, and other places for import. After landing, it is then transferred and sold to the Pingjin area (Beijing and Tianjin).</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai Resigns</p>
<h3>From the Position of Director of the Flour Special Tax Bureau</h3>
<p>Since taking office, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, has found his duties too numerous due to the complexity of chamber affairs and the need to constantly supervise and manage his private business. He found it difficult to juggle this with the duties as Director of the Flour Special Tax Bureau, and yesterday he specially telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to request his resignation. The original request stated: "Report on the election as Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, requesting approval to resign from the position. Since the National Government's revolutionary army pacified the southeastern provinces, Xiaolai has been repeatedly appointed to handle finance and reorganize taxation. For several years, I have been sincere and dedicated. I was then assigned by the Ministry to handle the collection of the Flour Special Tax in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang region. Implementing the plan, it has been two years. Everything that has happened should be clear. Considering that the Flour Special Tax was started in July of the seventeenth year [of the Republic, i.e. 1928], and ended in January of the eighteenth year, a total of seven months, a total of 1.1 million silver dollars were collected, an average of 150,700 silver dollars per month. Xiaolai took office as a tax collector, starting in February of the eighteenth year, and ending in July of this year, a total of eighteen months, collecting over 4 million silver dollars, averaging over 220,600 silver dollars per month. Comparing the tax revenue before and after, the amount has slightly increased, but this is not due to Xiaolai's abilities, but to the fact that the manufacturers understand the overall situation and work together to overcome difficulties. The Ministry takes into account the situation of merchants and protects production and transportation, and only then can there be this slight effect. Xiaolai dares not exaggerate his efforts, let alone rashly ask to leave. However, because Xiaolai is originally a merchant, engaging in the silk and tea industry, he was appointed as a committee member during the central government's reorganization of Shanghai merchant groups last year, and was later elected as a standing committee member. In June of this year, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce was formally established, and as a representative of the Silk Factory Guild, I was elected as an executive committee member, and also elected as a standing committee member. On July 1st, all committee members took office, and Xu Jizi was elected as Chairman in accordance with the law. However, Xu firmly resigned due to illness, and on August 20th, a temporary executive committee meeting was convened for re-election. Unexpectedly, after the election results were announced, Xiaolai was elected as Chairman. I immediately declared that I should consider it. Considering that the issue of the Chairman concerns the organization of the association, and a decision has been delayed, there is much suspicion. Xiaolai serves society with a long-held aspiration, and colleagues are urging, making it difficult to delay. If the organization cannot be sound due to personal advancement or retreat, especially at this time of tense situation, I am afraid that it will trigger unnecessary speculation and cause complications. However, the Chamber of Commerce is a legal organization for the public, and the Bureau is a national tax revenue agency. Xiaolai, holding both positions, fears that his talent is insufficient and his considerations may be inadequate. After much deliberation, I have no choice but to truthfully report to you, the Ministry Head, requesting your permission to resign from the position of Director of the Flour Special Tax Bureau in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang region, in order to avoid any delays. This is for the public good. I respectfully await your orders to comply."</p>

<h3>Flour Mills Deny Inspection of Mill Wheat</h3>
<p>The Inland Flour Mill Association held a meeting to oppose the Shanghai Agricultural Special Inspection Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines establishing a branch in Jiangbei to inspect the wheat purchased by the flour mills. The news has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now heard that the Association has directly sent a letter to the Office, stating the reasons why it is difficult to implement. The original letter is recorded as follows: "To Director Jin of the Shanghai Agricultural Products Inspection Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines, I am writing to you. We previously received your letter, along with five copies of the "Trial Measures for Inspecting Wheat in Various Counties of Jiangbei." Later, Deputy Director Jiang of your office delivered documents such as the "Circular Procedure" and instructed us to inform the factories and wheat farms in Jiangbei under our Association to report for inspection in accordance with the regulations. We immediately replied to Mr. Jiang that the inspection of wheat should not involve manufacturers, as this matter is of great importance to the future interests of inland factories. We would reply in writing after convening a meeting. Yesterday, our Association held a meeting and collectively discussed the matter. Everyone agreed that the inspection of wheat, in principle, is to improve the quality of agricultural products and prevent adulteration with water and fraud. It should be implemented on the farmers' side, following the methods of various countries around the world, inspecting the quality of agricultural products, determining grades, and strictly prohibiting fraud, so that there are no goods of poor quality or adulterated with water on the market. This is the fundamental solution. However, the inspection procedures stipulated by your office are not applied to farmers, but to manufacturers, which is neglecting the root and pursuing the branch, and is close to harassing the people. This should be revised. Also, the production of wheat in our country is the largest in the northern provinces, followed by Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, etc., and Shanghai is the largest market for wheat. The counties of Jiangbei are only the smallest area of wheat production in inland Jiangsu. Now, instead of opening offices in the important areas of various provinces at the same time, you are only setting up inspection offices in a corner of Jiangbei in Jiangsu, which not only cannot unify the methods, but also has partiality. This should be revised as well. Also, Article 4 of the Trial Measures states that the inspection of wheat will be carried out before transportation, export, import, and entry into the factory. Article 12 states that wheat that does not meet the standards may be ordered to be improved, or temporarily prohibited from transportation and sale, and may be given punishment according to the severity of the circumstances, with the penalty standard being up to three times the price of the goods, based on the weight of the water content and impurities exceeding the prescribed percentage. When manufacturers purchase wheat, at a time when the situation is stable and transportation is convenient, it is purchased from as far away as Shandong and Henan, and as close as Hubei and Anhui. Even at the present time, Hankou, Bengbu, and other places are purchasing areas. However, since there is no large agricultural product inspection office established in these provinces, the wheat purchased by the manufacturers has not been inspected. If it is transported to Jiangbei for import and your office inspects it and deems it unqualified, will you order it to be improved mid-way? The manufacturers are not willing to purchase this wheat of poor quality. If our factory does not purchase it, other factories will purchase it. Manufacturers take business needs as the purpose and cannot abandon the purchase because your office has not yet inspected it and needs to order the farmers to improve it. Now that it has been transported from a distant place, will you obstruct it at this time, or will you transport it back to the original place, order it to be improved, and then send it for inspection? Or will you temporarily prohibit transportation mid-way? If transportation is prohibited mid-way, the wheat will contain water and generate heat over time, and the flour milled out in the future will be of low quality, causing the manufacturers to suffer great losses. If you impose a penalty of three times the price of the goods according to your regulations, what crime have the manufacturers committed to suffer such trampling? This should be revised. Since the government has the grand aspiration of improving agricultural products, which common people would not be grateful for? The government should raise funds on its own, follow the good rules of various countries, and universally implement benevolent policies. Why take fees from the people and increase the burden on merchants? Moreover, since the government implemented the Flour Special Tax, the burden on our manufacturers has been heavy. Now, adding a wheat inspection fee of one cent per stone is tantamount to restoring wheat li [a type of tax], which is beyond our means. These are the main points. Other points, such as the inspection of wheat taking two or three hours, and the fact that staff must be sent to randomly sample and re-inspect wheat that has already been inspected, are either practically difficult to implement or prone to corruption during implementation, and are all difficult for our manufacturers to comply with. Therefore, we have specially written a letter detailing the reasons, respectfully hoping that you will examine and verify the matter. To Director Jin of the Shanghai Agricultural Products Inspection Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines."</p>

<p>Silk Cocoon Merchants Oppose the Import of Japanese Cocoons</p>
<p>Recently, due to the large-scale import of Japanese cocoons to Shanghai at low prices, resulting in fierce competition, the Chinese cocoon industry has been greatly affected. The cocoon merchants of various counties in Zhejiang Province specially telegraphed the National Government, requesting that it be banned or taxed heavily, in order to prohibit it through taxation. The original telegram reads: "To the Nanjing National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Central Party Headquarters: Silk cocoons are a major product of Chinese farmers. Their sales to Europe and America are deeply and significantly related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Recently, Japanese spring cocoons have been transported to China for sale at low prices, infringing on Chinese cocoons. It seems that there are already unscrupulous merchants colluding to purchase them in large quantities. If this situation is not prevented, they will continue to be transported to China, and our country's sericulture industry will be bankrupted. We urgently request that you strictly ban them and heavily tax the import of Japanese cocoons, prohibiting them through taxation, in order to maintain the industry. Zhejiang Province cocoon merchants (Jiaxing) Jiang Shifang, (Jiashan) Cheng Huilian, (Pinghu) Wang Weisan, (Haining) Zhong Guangyan, Wang Qingquan, (Shengxian) Lu Qinan, (Huzhou) Zhao Yi, etc. kowtow."</p>

<p>Increase of 1.5 Fen Per Bolt of Silk Fabric Starting from November 1st</p>
<p>The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Joint Association held its 7th temporary meeting of the 5th session yesterday. Over 20 representatives from the Suzhou, Shengze, Danyang, and Shanghai silk industries attended. Wang Jie'an, the standing chairman, was elected as chairman, and Sun Zheng was elected as secretary. The ceremony was conducted in accordance with regulations. First, the chairman announced the purpose of convening the temporary meeting today. Then, after reading the documents and instructions from various departments of the National Government, the following resolutions were passed after public deliberation: (1) "Use Domestic Goods" proposal: Resolved to present a petition to the Training Department of the Central Government, ordering personnel of all levels of the party throughout the country to consistently follow the regulations and implement the use of domestic goods. Separately send telegrams to the provincial governments, requesting that they order the municipal and county governments to implement the issuance of proclamations and strictly urge all sectors to implement the use of domestic goods. (2) "Exemption of Silk Tax" proposal: Resolved to submit a petition again to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting that after the implementation of the reduction of the likin tax, new taxes and levies should not be imposed on the moribund silk fabric industry under the pretext of compensation, in order to save it from ruin. (3) "Restriction of Cocoon Merchants" proposal: Resolved to telegram the Construction and Agriculture and Mines Departments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces again, requesting that they be executed in accordance with the proposal. (4) "Artificial Silk Factory" proposal: Resolved to retain it. (5) "Amendment of the Factory Law" proposal: Resolved to telegraph again to request amendment. (6) "Hiring a Permanent Legal Advisor for this Association" proposal: Resolved to retain it. (7) "Implementation of the New Price Scale" proposal: Resolved that the Association, in accordance with the public opinion of various Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, send a circular to the various trade associations, requesting that all goods comply with the resolution from September 11th to add 1.5 fen per bolt to the spring price scale, in order to protect the capital and save it from danger. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>Citibank</p>
<h3>Negotiations on the Dismissal of Chinese Employees</h3>
<p>The Head Office Denies the Matter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>However, Tokyo and Yokohama Have Implemented the Policy</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Citibank dismissing Chinese employees in its various branches in Japan, it was previously reported by the Yokohama branch of the Kuomintang that the former Commercial Reorganization Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce had repeatedly sent personnel to negotiate with the bank. The bank replied that it was all rumors. However, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce continued to receive letters from the Yokohama Party branch, stating that the dismissal had already been implemented and that the bank had not fulfilled its promise to the Minister to give three months' salary and six months' obligation. Considering that this matter concerns the unemployment relief of overseas Chinese merchants, the Chamber passed a resolution at its seventh standing committee meeting to present it to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for verification. The letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Citibank: "To Whom It May Concern: It was previously rumored that Citibank, with branches in Japan, was dismissing Chinese employees and replacing them with Japanese employees. The former Commercial Reorganization Association inquired with your bank and received a reply that it was not true. Now, on the 10th of this month, we received a letter from Yokohama, Japan, stating that the Tokyo branch of Citibank issued a notice on June 26th, dismissing all Chinese employees in July. The situation seems to be different from the previous rumors. Our Chamber cannot help but pay considerable attention to this matter. We are specially writing to your bank, hoping that you will investigate and show the truth. If what we have heard is true, can you help us mediate? Because among the customers of Citibank in Japan, the overseas Chinese in Japan should also account for the majority. In order to take care of the interests of Chinese customers and reconcile the feelings of all overseas Chinese, it is not appropriate to make too many changes. Moreover, at a time when the problem of unemployment is rampant in Japan, they are making every effort to exclude Chinese people. Your country's banks in Japan are purely in the position of a third party and should avoid this kind of disturbances."</p>
<p>Citibank's reply to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: "Translation: We have received your letter and thank you for your concern about the dismissal of Chinese employees in our branches in Japan. However, as far as we know, the situation of Chinese employees in our branches in Japan has not changed since our previous contact with your Chamber. We hereby inform you of this."</p>
<p>Letter from the Yokohama Party branch to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: "Regarding the incident of Citibank branches in Japan excluding Chinese employees, our department has repeatedly reported it to your Chamber and requested assistance, earnestly requesting a protest to the branch in Shanghai. Thanks to your enthusiasm and maintenance, and repeated negotiations with the head branch, the head branch has stated that it has no such malicious intention, and recently even stated that there has been no change. However, the various banks in Japan are cunning and intend to do so. As previously reported, the Tokyo branch implemented the dismissal of all Chinese employees at the end of June, and did not fulfill its obligation to the Minister to give a three-month advance notice and six months' salary (only paid three months). Recently, they have intensified their efforts and resorted to more sinister means to avoid the crime of excluding Chinese people. The matter is of great importance. We would like to inform you of their recent cunning plan. According to the investigation, the Tokyo branch of the bank issued a letter of recommendation to the dismissed Chinese employees, which did not specify the environmental reasons and stated that Japanese people must be used. In other words, it is necessary to be pro-Japanese and exclude Chinese people. Even a three-foot child can understand the fact that they are pro-Japanese and excluding Chinese people. This kind of letter of recommendation will not only put our Chinese employees in a desperate situation, but also give foreigners a guide to exclude Chinese people. Because our Chinese employees are now being excluded from the United States due to international relations, even if they want to transfer to other foreign banks, they will also be subject to the same excuse from other countries, and the Chinese are bound to be in a desperate situation. Moreover, if this trend starts, other foreign banks and companies may follow suit. If, unfortunately, the same thing happens again, tens of thousands of overseas Chinese will be in a desperate situation. It is heard that the various branches in Japan (such as Yokohama, Kobe, Osaka, Tokyo, etc.) know that we have filed a protest, so they have changed their cunning plan. For example, the Tokyo and Osaka branches have dismissed all Chinese employees, leaving only their compradors, not allowing them to leave, reducing their salaries, making their finances insufficient, changing their positions, making them appear unskilled, and unable to find a job again, so they have to resign automatically. Since they are resigning, the so-called six-month salary is hopeless. But if they reluctantly take the job, they have already intended to fire them, so why worry about them not being able to resign? Therefore, one can hide the evil of excluding Chinese people, and the other can save the six-month salary. Their intentions are insidious, comprehensive, and meticulous. At this moment, all the banks have put it into practice, and our Chinese employees have no place to stand. Therefore, we are specially writing to you and again urge your Chamber to protest, and be sure to expose their cunning plan, so that they cannot succeed, in order to maintain the livelihood of overseas Chinese in Japan. Otherwise, you must order all their branches in China, except for Americans, to use Chinese people, in order to conform to the practice of the branches in Japan. If not, then we can only send a telegram to the whole country, let everyone know their wickedness and resist trading with them, in order to show our resistance and extend justice. The matter concerns the survival of overseas Chinese. We hope that you will do your best to maintain it, and we will not give up until we achieve our goal. Before the letter, we are indignant and extremely expectant. Bao Yingzhang, Standing Committee Member of the Yokohama Direct Branch of the Kuomintang."</p>
<p>Reply from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to the Yokohama Party branch: "On the 20th of this month, we received your letter, stating that the Citibank branches in Japan dismissed Chinese employees, which has already been implemented, and attached two photographs of letters of recommendation, requesting us to protest again to maintain the livelihood of overseas Chinese in Japan. Regarding this matter, your letter said that the dismissal of all Chinese employees had been implemented at the end of June, and that the bank had not fulfilled its obligation to the Minister to give a three-month advance notice and six months' salary. This matter has already been negotiated by the Minister in Japan, and the so-called three-month advance notice and six-month salary indicate that the dismissal is a confirmed fact and cannot be reversed. However, your branch did not mention this in the previous letter, so the Shanghai head office was able to deal with it superficially and give empty promises. Now that the dismissal has been going on for two months, and the Minister and various groups in Japan have failed to negotiate successfully, it is difficult for our Chamber to reverse the situation afterwards. Therefore, after receiving your letter, our Chamber has passed a resolution at the standing committee meeting to present it to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for verification. We are now sending this letter in response to your request, and we will forward it to the Bureau of Social Affairs for joint verification. Please check it."</p>

<h3>Record of the Fierce Battle Between Detectives and Bandits at the First Class Hotel</h3>
<p>One Bandit Killed on the Spot</p>
<p>One Bandit Wounded and Captured</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Detectives Wounded by Gunfire</p>
<p>Commendable Courage in Capturing Thieves</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, at the Shanghai First Class Hotel at the intersection of Henan Road and Beijing Road, detectives and bandits exchanged gunfire during an arrest, resulting in a fierce shootout. As a result, one bandit was killed and another wounded. The wounded bandit was captured on the spot, and weapons were found in the room. Two detectives were wounded, one Western detective named Harvey and one Chinese detective named Wu Chunrong. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Rushing to the Hotel: The Central Police Station on Fuzhou Road recently received a tip that several bandits were hiding in the Shanghai First Class Hotel at 229 Henan Road. Yesterday afternoon at approximately 3:50 PM, Western Inspector Luo Bingsheng, Western Detective Harvey, Platt, along with Chinese detectives Ding Huaguo, Sun Wen'an, Wu Chunrong, Tang Zengxiang, Ma Xiaozhi, Yin Shaochen, Ji Binkui, Pang Jinshan, and others, all armed, rushed to the aforementioned location. They learned that the bandits were staying in room 32 on the second floor. The detectives quietly ascended the stairs to make the arrest and stationed assistants at key points of entry and exit to prevent escape. Room 32 was located at the end of the corridor. As the detectives approached, the door was tightly closed, preventing them from seeing inside. Western Detective Harvey bravely kicked the door open, preparing to rush in. Detective and Bandit Exchange Gunfire: As soon as the door was kicked open, a bullet suddenly flew out of the room, hitting Harvey in the right arm before he could dodge. Harvey did not retreat and immediately returned fire. The bandits inside also fired continuously, resisting arrest. The Chinese and Western detectives fired back. The sound of gunfire echoed loudly, causing panic among the guests upstairs and downstairs. After about two or three minutes, the room fell silent. The detectives forced their way into the room and found a bandit lying stiffly on the ground, covered in blood. He was already dead. Another bandit, realizing that resistance was futile, surrendered.</p>
<p>Bandit Dead, Detectives Wounded: In this operation, in addition to Western Detective Harvey being wounded in the right arm, Chinese detective Wu Chunrong was also shot in the upper left chest. One bandit was killed and one wounded. The deceased had three gunshot wounds, all in vital areas. It was reported that a Chinese detective fired into the room from above through a gap in the ceiling, killing the bandit. The wounded bandit, named Chen Bingda, 25 years old, sustained two gunshot wounds to his legs and arms. He confessed that the deceased was Zheng Wanqing and admitted to being a thief. During the exchange, the detectives fired approximately 29 shots, while the bandits fired five or six. A set of smoking paraphernalia, a pistol, and six bullets were found in room 32. When the wounded bandit Chen Bingda was captured, the detectives ordered him to throw the pistol out of the room first before surrendering. Chinese detective Wu Chunrong was not aware of his injury at first. He hired a rickshaw to return to the police station. It was only when he undressed that he saw blood flowing profusely, realizing he had been wounded. The detectives' courage in arresting the bandits, disregarding their own safety, is commendable.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Public Officials</h3>
<p>Falsely Claiming to Be from the Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>Extorting and Intimidating Officials and Civilians</p>
<p>The Bandits Have Been Questioned and Sentenced</p>
<p>To Be Handled by the Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>Recently, Lu Sanjiu from Ningbo, Wei Songbai and Lu Qiaolin from Wuxi, Lu Fukun from Yancheng, and Lin Zijun and Chen Yangbing from Pudong, Shanghai, dared to falsely claim to be public officials of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, extorting and intimidating people. They recently threatened Xie Renkun, Liu Fuyuan, and Xu Youfa, who resided at 3637 Zhoujiazui Road, extorting 1,000 yuan in cash. The case was discovered by Wang Bin, a detective of the Garrison Headquarters. He reported to Commander Xiong, who deemed their actions extremely illegal and ordered their immediate arrest and severe punishment. He immediately ordered the relevant department to prepare a document and dispatched the detective to the Hongkou Police Station to add detectives Feng Qi and Zhang Yuting to apprehend the suspects. Fortunately, the defrauded money was discovered early and had not yet been divided up and spent. All the money was recovered, and counterfeit epaulettes were confiscated. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special District Court for investigation. Zhan Jifeng, legal counsel for the Garrison Headquarters, represented the department in court, requesting that the case be transferred back to the Garrison Headquarters for trial. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated that the evidence in the case was complete and that the Municipal Council had no objection to the transfer. After Judge Feng Shide briefly questioned the defendants, he ordered that Lu Sanjiu and the other six, along with the stolen 1,000 yuan, be handed over to Detective Wang to be taken back to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation.</p>
<p>Additional Women's Organizations</p>
<h3>Women Police Movement</h3>
<p>Preparing for a Large-Scale Promotion</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, women's organizations in Shanghai, in view of the current social situation in Shanghai, believe that there is an increasing need to establish women police. They are currently preparing for a large-scale promotional campaign as a preliminary step. After investigating the situation of female workers, the committee suggested that the most effective way to deal with the various adverse environments is for the Municipal Council to organize a female police squad, granting them all the powers of patrolmen to supervise dance halls and factories, strictly implement health programs, and arrest criminal offenders. Because women are better able to understand women's issues, this female patrol is bound to be immensely useful in all social welfare work. Currently, many major cities around the world have added women police, with remarkable results. If Shanghai can follow suit, it will surely lead to a rapid solution to most of the problems that women who are concerned about social conditions are usually anxious about. However, according to the leaders of women's organizations, when the plan was first solicited for opinions from the Municipal Council and the police station, few people agreed. But it is expected that after public promotion, the authorities will give it a try.</p>

<h3>Englishman Accuses Wife of Adultery</h3>
<p>Pregnant After Adultery with a Greek Man</p>
<p>Witnesses Testify to Having Seen It</p>
<p>Lance, a 54-year-old Englishman and manager of a foreign firm at 47 Beijing Road, recently hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint in the Special District Court against Greek man McLeay for disrupting his family, having an affair with his wife, and inciting her to flee. The court approved the request and summoned McLeay to the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning. The plaintiff Lance stated that he married Ms. Washington in Kobe, Japan, in 1917, and they had children. In 1925, his wife and children came to Shanghai to study and lived at 71 Doulean Road, while he went to Tianjin for business. He recently returned to Shanghai and learned that his wife had an affair with the defendant, but he did not witness it. On the evening of July 1, he received a report from his friend Liddell, who said that he saw his wife alone at apartment number 1, 24 Kunshan Road, the afternoon before, and that she did not leave until the next morning. After further investigation, he learned that the place was the defendant's residence and that his wife was currently pregnant with the defendant's child. All his decorations and furniture were taken by the defendant. He requested an investigation. The defendant stated that he was an engineer and resided at 192 Yuyuan Road. Regarding the plaintiff's accusations, (1) he claimed that as for the adultery with his wife, the plaintiff's wife is also in court and can testify. (2) As for the items that were taken, those items were originally his. Lance's wife also filed a statement admitting that she did visit the defendant at 24 Kunshan Road and had an affair with him, claiming that she committed adultery under the instructions of her husband. After reviewing the statements, Judge Sun Yuan ordered that the case be rescheduled for further hearing.</p>
<h3>One Punch Kills a Man</h3>
<p>Conflict Over Food</p>
<p>Gu Linzhen Dies After Being Punched</p>
<p>Gu Linzhen, a 43-year-old man from Jiangyin, worked at the Meida Tofu Shop owned by Xie Jintao at 618 Datong Road, Zhabei. While having dinner the night before, he went outside to relieve himself due to sudden urgency. When he returned, half of his share of food had disappeared (the shop provided three meals a day, with each worker having one bowl of vegetables to eat separately). He then discovered that his colleague Jiang Honggao from Hangzhou had stolen it, so he loudly berated Jiang, grabbing him to argue. However, Jiang swore that he did not steal his vegetables. They disagreed and started fighting. Gu had hemoptysis, making him physically weak. Jiang was only 19, but he was very strong. He punched Gu in the waist, causing Gu to fall to the ground without moving. At first, they thought he was pretending, but he did not get up for a long time. When they touched him, his body was cold as ice, and he had already died. Xie Jintao, the shop owner, knew that Jiang had caused trouble and was afraid of being implicated, so she called Zheng (39 years old), the deceased's wife from Changzhou, and together with Hu Qianyin, the watchman of the area, they took Jiang to the Fourth District Headquarters. Director Jin conducted a preliminary investigation and found that Jiang had killed a man with one punch, which was a strange occurrence. Fearing that the deceased might have had underlying health issues, he ordered the local headman to report to the court for an autopsy. Yesterday afternoon, Inspector Xu conducted the autopsy and found that Gu Linzhen had indeed died from being hit in the waist. The family was ordered to prepare the coffin, and the murderer Jiang Honggao was taken to the judicial department for investigation.</p>
<h3>Confession in the Parricide Case (Continued) (Yesterday)</h3>
<p>Sun Liansheng Admits to the Murder</p>
<p>The Case is Now Completely Clear</p>
<p>The confession of Sun Liansheng, who killed his adoptive father Sun Laowu, was not fully recorded yesterday. The following is a continuation:</p>
<p>Sun Fusheng: Official (Question) Testimony of Sun Fusheng, 39 years old, residing at 6 Hengxin Lane, Wai Ma Road, working as a driver. The deceased Sun Laowu was my fifth uncle. I am from the eldest branch of the family. Sun Liansheng is from the third branch and was adopted by Sun Laowu for two or three years. (Question) How was his behavior usually? (Answer) Greedy and lazy. Two days before my fifth uncle died, he told me that Liansheng had stolen money the first time, and sold the car the second time. Liansheng wanted to kill him and asked me to write a letter to the countryside, asking Liansheng's father to come. I asked the accountant to write the letter. It was a case of a son wanting to kill his father, and a father wanting to kill his son, so I asked Liansheng's father to come to Shanghai quickly. However, the letter did not arrive before he died. I learned about my fifth uncle's death on the third day. The neighbor of the deceased, Chen Guanghua, sent a letter to my cousin Jiang Yinsheng, who relayed it to me. I first sent a telegram and then went to Jiangwan. I saw the deceased on the ground, half of his face was gone, and only half of his neck was connected. He was shirtless and only wearing a pair of pants. Three of his left fingers were broken. The prosecutor came to perform the autopsy at 3:00 PM. (Question) What was the name of the ship to Tianshenggang? The answer was either Dada or Datong, but it always departed around 1:00 AM. After Liansheng was captured, at my father Sun Xueli and his father Sun Xuewen's place, he admitted to murdering his fifth uncle. Qiu Lansheng was captured on the third day because the neighbor said that Ji Shuangquan was staying at his house, so he ordered Qiu to lead the capture. Ji Shuangquan ran away and eventually went to the deceased's house, pretending to inquire, so he was captured. (Question) How did you know that Ji Shuangquan was the murderer? (Answer) Before the deceased died, he often told the neighbors that they wanted to change his mind and asked the neighbors to visit his house often. (Question) How did the neighbors not know when Sun Laowu was killed? (Answer) The so-called neighbors lived far away. The nearest neighbor was a Cantonese family who were merchants and had no contact with them on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Sun Xuewen: Official (Question) Testimony of Sun Xuewen, 60 years old, from Shatou Town, Tongzhou. Sun Liansheng is my son and has been adopted by Sun Laowu as his son. On the third day, Liansheng and Qiu Shuntao were arrested at my nephew's house in Tongzhou. (Question) How did your brother Sun Laowu die? Did you ask your son? (Answer) At first, he refused to say, but later on the ship, he admitted that Ji Shuangquan used a knife, Qiu Shuntao used a hoe, and Liansheng used scissors, and Qiu Lansheng used a shovel to kill him. He told me that himself.</p>
<p>Sun Xueli: Official (Question) Testimony of Sun Xueli, 65 years old. Liansheng is my nephew. He said on the ship that Qiu Shuntao was the middleman for selling the car for 50 yuan, and he had already received the money. Because he did not have a permit, and Sun Laowu refused to take out the permit, the Shandong man who bought the car returned the car, and Liansheng had to return the money. While Liansheng was in the Fifth District Bureau in the jail, I asked him how Laowu died. He said that Ji Shuangquan took the knife, Qiu Shuntao took the hoe, and Qiu Lansheng took the shovel, and he himself took the scissors. (Question) When you asked him, did you ask if they had discussed it before killing Laowu? (Answer) Of course, they discussed it together.</p>
<p>Sun Faming: Official (Question) Testimony of Sun Faming, 40 years old, from Tongzhou, in the automobile business. Sun Liansheng is my cousin. On the morning of the third day of the intercalary June, at 9:30 AM, I received a telegram saying that Sun Laowu had died. Around 10:00 AM, I was not at home. My wife was washing rice outside the door. Liansheng and Qiu Shuntao passed by. My wife asked them where they came from. They said they came from Shanghai. My wife insisted on keeping them for lunch and went outside to discuss it with others. Then they tied up Liansheng and Shuntao. When I returned home in the afternoon, I questioned him. At first, he said that Laowu was not dead, but later he said that Ji Shuangquan and others had killed him. They had discussed it three months ago. (Question) Did you ask Qiu Shuntao? (Answer) He refused to speak, and we did not ask him. But during the interrogation in the Fifth District, they mostly admitted to it.</p>
<p>Chen Guanghua: Official (Question) Testimony of witness Chen Guanghua, 42 years old, from Nantong, living in the Jiangwan Racecourse, making a living by farming. He was a close friend of Sun Laowu, whose house was three li away. He came to my house at 5:30 AM on the first day and said that Liansheng wanted to harm him. I told him to tell Sun Fusheng, and he taught me to go and watch the house. On the morning of the third day, at 6:00 AM, the carpenter Jiang came to report the news, and only then did I know that the reason was the sale of the rickshaw, which Laowu did not allow.</p>
<p>Xu Farong: Official (Question) Testimony of Xu Farong, 58 years old, from Nantong, living in Jiangwan. Sun Laowu is my cousin. I don't know how he died. On the third day, Chen Guanghua came to report the news, and only then did I know. I don't know who killed him.</p>
<p>Wu Xiqi: Official (Question) Testimony of Wu Xiqi, 31 years old, from Nantong, living in Jiangwan, making a living by farming. I don't know Sun Laowu. Ji Shuangquan helped me farm for one day. (Question) Did he come to your house on the night of the second day? (Answer) Yes, he did. (Question) When? (Answer) At 10:00 PM. He said he came to avoid the rain and slept there. He left at dawn. (Question) Were there any blood stains? (Answer) He came at night and left before dawn, so it was hard to tell in the dark.</p>
<p>Wang Da: Official (Question) Testimony of Wang Da, 37 years old, from Rugao, living in Zhangjiazhai, Qujiaqiao, making a living by farming. Sun Laowu was my friend. (Question) Did you know about the matter of their uncle and nephew selling the car? (Answer) I knew. His nephew had already sold the car, and Sun Laowu went to get it back. He went to Shanghai on the first day. At 7:00 PM, I went to his house to chat and left at 9:00 PM. Sun Liansheng did not enter the Du gate because of the car matter. Later, I went out and saw Ji Shuangquan and Qiu Shuntao on the street, along with two people I did not recognize. I asked them where they were going, and they said they were going to play.</p>
<p>Jiang Jiashun: Official (Question) Testimony of Jiang Jiashun, 41 years old, from Tongzhou, living in Jiangwan, working as a carpenter. (Question) Did Qiu Lansheng eat snails with you on the second day? (Answer) No. (Question) Did Ji Shuangquan give Qiu Lansheng two catties of snails? Do you know about this? (Answer) I don't know. I went to Xu Farong's house with my family on the second day.</p>
<p>At this point, the official summoned all the defendants to the court to confront the witnesses. Sun Liansheng initially tried to deny it, but his father, Sun Xuewen, said, "You told me very clearly. If you intended to kill your uncle, it would be worth it to pay with your life. If it was someone else's intention, just say it and don't take the blame for others." At this point, Sun Liansheng claimed that Ji Shuangquan had acted first, Qiu Shuntao had dragged the uncle off the bed, and he had taken the scissors. The official asked, "Did you stab him?" (Answer) "No, I didn't stab him." The official asked, "If you didn't do it, would others dare to do it?" (Answer) "I was the fourth one to do it, and I made a cut on his foot with the knife." (Question) "You were the second one to stab him in the neck." Sun Liansheng hesitated in response. The official asked, "How many days did you discuss it?" (Answer) "On the first day, at the Luo Jinmiao Bridge, Liu Junchuan, Wei Qiaohai, Ji Shuangquan, Qiu Lansheng, and Qiu Shuntao sat on the stone and discussed it." The official said, "Don't accuse anyone wrongly." (Answer) "That's the truth." Thus, the case was completely cleared up.</p>

<h3>Shutting Down Ankangli's Artesian Well</h3>
<p>Deadline to Switch to Tap Water</p>
<p>Compulsory Enforcement If Violated</p>
<p>There are 53 buildings with approximately 100 households in Ankangli, Yongxing Road, Zhabei. An artesian well was originally installed and registered with the Municipal Public Works Bureau at the end of November of the eighteenth year. At that time, the water volume was sufficient, and residents had no complaints. Unexpectedly, at the beginning of this month, the well suddenly ran out of water, causing panic among the residents. The case was reported through the Party Department and forwarded to the Public Works Bureau for handling. The bureau sent staff to investigate and found that the well was being overused due to the summer heat, causing the well to be clogged with fine sand, thus hindering the water flow. The water level in the water tower was almost non-existent. The owner was hiring workers to dredge the well and open the public taps in the neighborhood to provide water. However, the well's pump was a Wellington No. 2, which required at least a 5-horsepower motor. The current motor only had 3 horsepower. It could barely be used for a new well, but the well was old, the water source was low, and the water tower was high, resulting in insufficient power. The Public Works Bureau sent a letter to Ankang Real Estate Company, the owner, ordering them to replace the motor with a 7.5-horsepower motor. If the repair work would take more than three days, tap water should be connected first to ensure the water supply for the residents. However, after more than ten days, the owner had not complied. Yesterday, the bureau sent another warning letter, setting a deadline of three days to completely switch to tap water. Failure to comply would result in compulsory enforcement in accordance with the city's water supply regulations.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Reconstruction of Houses in Minhang Town</h3>
<p>City Appearance Renewed</p>
<p>The houses along Xianglidao and Zhangjialong South in Minhang Town were severely damaged and presented a dangerous situation. District Chief Wu sent letters to the house owners, inviting them to discuss reconstruction, obtain construction permits, and comply with the resolutions of the first county administrative conference, requiring the main streets to be no less than 5 meters wide and the alleyways to be no less than 2 meters wide. The streets and lanes were widened in accordance with the regulations. A large portion has already been completed, and the city appearance has been renewed. The reconstruction of houses in the area south of Danong and the old West Street is also under discussion and actively underway.</p>
<p>Announcement by the Municipal Public Safety Bureau</p>
<h3>Simplified Chart of Population Changes</h3>
<p>Yuan Liang, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Safety Bureau, in order to rectify the population census, eliminate hidden dangers, and maintain public order, has specially drawn up a simplified chart of population changes and ordered painters to paint it in prominent places in Zhabei and Huxi, so that merchants and people in all places can be impressed and implement it. The chart is divided into eight items: birth, entry, death, emigration, immigration, adoption, relocation, inheritance, and marriage. If any of the above items occur, they should be reported to the police station in charge. Failure to report any of the above matters will result in detention for up to ten days or a fine of up to ten yuan upon discovery. If the report is not truthful when staff members conduct a spot check, detention for five to thirty days or a fine of five to thirty yuan will be imposed if inconsistencies are discovered later.</p>
<h3>Ge Yuming Sentenced for Adultery</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Three Months in Prison</p>
<p>Ge Yuming was accused of adultery with Wei Suqin, the wife of Cheng Youren, an employee of the Zhonghua Book Company. His superiors dismissed him for tarnishing official ethics. However, the initial trial of the lawsuit resulted in Ge's victory. Cheng was unwilling to accept the result and filed an appeal against Ge and Wei. Wei had already left Shanghai, and the appeal hearing did not appear. Cheng went to the countryside to find the former maid A Qiao to testify to the adultery.

<h3>Investigating the Origin of Sixty-One Yuan Banknotes</h3>
<p>At 6:40 AM yesterday morning at the Shanghai South Railway Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, as the station was preparing the second early express train to Hangzhou, a boy of about fourteen or fifteen years old came to the station to buy a ticket to Hangzhou. While the boy was wandering around the ticket office, a man of about twenty years old pointed to the boy and told the police that the boy was carrying a roll of banknotes that he had pickpocketed on a tram, so he followed him to the station. The police interrogated the boy, who said his name was Chen Jinquan, fifteen years old, from Hangzhou. He came to Shanghai from Hangzhou in April to find his older brother Zhong Changsheng, who now runs a "Swallow's Nest" in the Shunxing Building on Dongxin Bridge in the French Concession. His brother is his father's son by a previous marriage, so their surnames are different. The sixty-one yuan in banknotes were stolen from his brother last night while he was asleep because his brother and sister-in-law often beat and scolded him. He did not pickpocket it on a tram. The police took both parties to the chief of police at the South Station. Chief Lou interrogated them and their statements were the same. The police were sent to investigate the Shunxing Building on Dongxin Bridge in the French Concession and asked his brother Zhong Changsheng to come forward. Together with the person and the money, they were bailed out.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor, We read in your newspaper on August 22nd, in the local news column, a section about an apprentice being electrocuted to death. The Xing Yu Xing printing company rented a portion of a downstairs unit from our company; the deceased, Weng Dingfang, was an apprentice of the printer. The fan, where the incident took place, was installed out of the way, in a corner. The apprentice was an employee of the evening shift, and was, during the evening break, standing, playing in an otherwise unused spot, when he stepped on the electrical wiring, which led to his death. The story published by your paper has some differences from the facts. We therefore request that the letter be published in the letter section for correction. Sincerely, Wenhua Fine Arts Books and Printing Company.</p>

<h3>Summary of Statistical Overview of Compulsory Education</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Compulsory Education Joint Preparatory Office recently compiled statistics on the general situation of compulsory education in Jiangsu counties in the current year (18th year). The main points are extracted below.</p>
<p>(1) The total number of schools this year is 8,284. There are more than 300 schools in Yancheng, Wujin, Nantong, and Wuxi counties. There are more than 200 schools in Jiangyin, Nanhui, Rugao, Yixing, Songjiang, and Funing counties. There are less than 100 schools in 24 counties, and there are less than 40 schools in Siyang, Lishui, Ganyu, Yangzhou, and Donghai counties. (2) The total number of grades is 13,825, with the most being 760 grades in Wujin, followed by 635 grades in Wuxi, and the least being 31 grades in Yangzhou, followed by 35 grades in Donghai. The difference between counties is huge, and the ratio of the number of schools to the number of grades is not the same. (3) The total number of teachers is 19,637. Only Wujin has more than 1,000 teachers. There are less than 100 teachers in Lishui, Jiangpu, Yangzhou, Yizheng, Donghai, and Ganyu counties. The difference between 28 teachers in Donghai and 1,123 teachers in Wujin is more than 40 times. (4) The total number of children is 547,103. There are more than 10,000 people in Wujin etc. (30193-10094) in 17 counties, and more than 1,000 people in Liyang etc. (9744-1138) in 43 counties. Only Donghai has less than 1,000 people (847). (5) The total amount of funding is 4,445,671 yuan. More than 100,000 yuan is found in Suzhou City and Wuxi etc. (255848, 24517-107052) in 16 counties. The remaining 45 counties have more than 10,000 yuan (Nanhui 99729 Yangzhou 10236). (6) According to the total number of the above items, the average number of grades per school is 1.67, the number of teachers is 2.37, the number of children is 660.4, and the funding required is 356.77 yuan. Also, the average number of children per grade is 39.57, the number of teachers required is 1.23, and the funding required is 321.63 yuan. (In the previous year, the average number of children per grade was 37.57, the number of teachers was 1.44, and the funding required was 306.34 yuan.) Also, each teacher educates an average of 27.86 children, and each child spends 8.13 yuan per year. (In the previous year, each teacher educated an average of 26.17 children, and each child accounted for 8.15 yuan in county fees.) In terms of the value of educational economics, this year is more advanced than the previous year.

The number of schools increased in 37 counties, and decreased in 24 counties and 1 city. The number of grades increased in 40 counties and 1 city, and decreased in 20 counties. The number of teachers increased in 42 counties and 1 city, and decreased in 19 counties. The number of children increased in 50 counties and 1 city, and decreased in 11 counties. The amount of funding increased in 44 counties and 1 city, and decreased in 17 counties. There are no counties or cities that have maintained the status quo. (8) Compared with the previous year, the total number of increases is less than the previous year, which shows that the proportion of increase this year is less than the proportion of increase in the previous year. For example, the increase in funding in the previous year was 907,214 yuan, while this year it was only 307,245 yuan. Also, the increase in children in the previous year was 42,657, while this year it was only 39,459. (9) This year, the total number of private schools has decreased compared with the previous year. The number of schools has decreased by 80, the number of grades has decreased by 118, the number of teachers has decreased by 4, and the number of children has decreased by 2,182. However, the funding has increased by 11,780 yuan, but in terms of educational efficiency, it has decreased. (10) This statistics is based on the statistical tables of primary schools and primary departments of primary schools filled out by the education bureaus of 61 counties in Jiangsu and the Suzhou Municipal Government. In order to understand the general situation of four-year compulsory education in 61 counties in Jiangsu and Suzhou City in the 18th year, and to compare it with the 17th year to see the growth and decline of compulsory education, the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department ordered the issuance.</p>

England's White also defeated America's Smith three sets to zero. At the same time, England also forfeited one group, resulting in England and America each winning one group. Starting at 4:00 PM today, there will be one group each of doubles matches between China and Portugal and England and America. The results of yesterday's three group matches are recorded below:</p>
<h3>### Lin Baohua Shows Strength</h3>
<p>Lin Baohua's opponent, the Portuguese Canavero, is one of the famous doubles experts at sea. His singles skills are far from his doubles stability. However, it is not because of his lack of knowledge, but because of his lack of physical strength. At the beginning of the fierce battle, the old general wielded his sword and rode his horse, and was indeed a hero for a while. He won the first game. Lin Baohua's technique is pure and he has a plan in mind. He already knows the opponent's strengths and weaknesses, so in the advance and retreat, high slices, low nets, forward draws, and counterattacks, he directly hit the enemy's vital points. After losing the first game, he won the next three games in a row. He finally won the first set 6-3. In the second set, Lin's ball momentum was even stronger, and Canavero's response became more and more poor. Soon Lin won again 6-1. In the third set, Canavero's ambition broke out and he was unwilling to fall behind, struggling several times and making every effort. Lin initially planned to go straight in and complete the great cause, but considering the opponent's stubbornness, he turned into a tense situation. The final victory of the third set still went to Lin 6-4, but there was indeed a fierce battle in it.</p>
<p>(China) Lin Baohua (6...3 6...1 6...4) Canavero (Portugal)</p>

<h3>### Qiu Feihai Achieves Victory</h3>
<p>With steady technique and skillful skills, Qiu Feihai defeated the Portuguese Korasha, making him helpless. Korasha was originally a new genius, good at running and able to withstand battles. This time he met Qiu, and before the battle he had a strategy to try to take advantage of the net and hope for a miracle. Unexpectedly, Qiu's sudden east and west side balls had already made him at a loss. Occasionally, when the time came, he rushed forward to the net, but the rear was empty, and Qiu took the opportunity to enter directly. In short, Korasha had completely revealed all his abilities, but he was eventually overturned by Qiu at will. The first set was 6-0, and the results of the second and third sets were the same. All 18 games in the three sets were under Qiu's control. He won the entire victory in just 40 minutes. It was not a good sight.</p>
<p>(China) Qiu Feihai (6...0 6...0 6...0) Korasha (Portugal)</p>
<h3>### White Shows His Skills</h3>
<p>The Englishman White, who has dominated the sea for many years in singles, attacked the American Smith yesterday like a storm, making it difficult to resist. The first set was especially his amazing work, winning all with a straight 6. The second set was as strong as ever. Except for the fourth game, when Smith won back a game with a net, the rest all failed. As a result, White won 6-1. In the third set, White, with a 5-1 lead, suddenly showed signs of fatigue and suffered a sudden blow from Smith, losing two games. Fortunately, the difference in skills was too great, so he finally won 6-3. (England) White (6...0 6...1 6...3) Smith (America)</p>
<h3>### Individual Skills</h3>
<p>Yesterday's three groups of talents were quite different, so they all decided the winner and loser with a one-sided situation. The three winners also had their own strengths. Qiu was steady and mature, with excellent positioning. Lin's serve was powerful and he was good at the net. White's draw and hit were appropriate and the ball was not wasted. Among the three losers, Canavero was the strongest, and the other two were even further apart.</p>
<h3>### Today's Doubles Match</h3>
<p>Starting at 4:00 PM today, China vs. Portugal and England vs. America will both play doubles matches at the original venue. China will send Jiang Daozhang and Zheng Zhaojia to compete against the Portuguese representatives Canavero and Korasha. At the same time, England's White and Stokes will fight against America's Sguya and Haines. The victory or defeat of England and America is related to the overall situation in the future, and both sides attach great importance to it. The battle between China and Portugal is relatively relaxed.</p>
<p>Tonight at 7:00 PM at the YMCA</p>

<h3>### Nanyang Summer School Basketball Team to Conquer Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Nanyang Business School basketball team departed by car at 8:00 AM yesterday to Songjiang, intending to defeat all the strong teams in Songjiang. Teams such as the Songguang team once charged and fought bravely during the provincial sports meet, but were eventually defeated by the Nanyang Business School team. Therefore, it is expected that this battle will be extremely fierce. It is also heard that the Shanghai Yuguang team is also touring Songjiang. When the two teams meet, they will definitely compete.</p>
<h3>### The Main Purpose of the Huadong Sports Company</h3>
<p>Striving to encourage various sports</p>
<p>Achieving the goal of promoting domestic goods</p>
<p>Since our country suffered a defeat in this Far Eastern Games, the whole country, up and down, believes that if the sports community does not engage in deep practice and actively prepare, it will be difficult to occupy a place on the Far Eastern stage in the future. It is now known that a group of sports enthusiasts, in view of this, have gathered several like-minded people to create the Huadong Sports Equipment Co., Ltd. One is to purchase various sports equipment from advanced countries abroad, and the other is to contact well-known domestic factories to manufacture a large number of goods, aiming to achieve the goal of promoting domestic goods, and to do its best to promote various sports competitions in its spare time, in order to encourage them. The company's preparations are already in place, and foreign goods have also arrived one after another, and the address of No. 10 Central Road, Nanjing Road has been rented, and Li Baojun has been hired as the manager. It will be officially opened for business on August 25th, and all sectors are welcome to visit at that time.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Man—Darling, if you are willing to marry me, I would be happy even if I died.</p>
<p>Woman—Saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda. That's why I don't want to marry you.</p>
<p>A—Why have there been so many divorce cases lately? Everyone is treating it like a daily meal. What is the reason for this? It's worth studying.</p>
<p>B—It's very simple. It's because there are too many people getting married.</p>
<p>Father—When I was your age, I never smoked cigarettes. In the future, when you have a son, you won't be able to teach him a lesson.</p>
<p>Son—Father, I am the most easygoing person. I won't be as pretentious as you are.</p>
<p>A—What do you think of the article I just wrote?</p>
<p>B—What are you talking about?</p>
<p>A—Haven't you read it yet?</p>
<p>B—I've read it. That's why I'm asking you this.</p>

<p>Son—Here it is. It's me.</p>
<h3>Small Talk by the Autumn Window</h3>
<p>— Zhi Zheng</p>
<p>The early autumn day is long. Living in a quiet room, I occasionally recall anecdotes of contemporary people. I will select a few to help with conversation.</p>
<p>Wu Zhihui on the Street Wu Zhihui, after mediating the war without results, retired to Shanghai. He lived in seclusion. One day, I went to Shilu, Damalu, for some matters. Suddenly, I saw Mr. Wu walking slowly north. He was wearing an old Hangzhou silk long gown and white shoes. He frequently wiped the sweat from his forehead with a handkerchief. At that time, Shilu was crowded with people. Mr. Wu went to various clothing stores, standing for a few minutes, paying attention to the clothes hanging there. Because Mr. Wu looked like a country person, no one recognized him. I originally intended to be Mr. Wu's follower for five minutes, to observe the behavior of a great man. Unfortunately, I couldn't because of matters. I still regret it to this day.</p>
<p>Song Ziwen at the Train Station Finance Minister Song Ziwen, strategizing and planning, has worked hard and made great contributions. But I have never been able to see his demeanor. One morning, I was at the train station for some matters. Suddenly, I saw armed military police, distributed at important points. They drew their guns from their holsters, as if under martial law. For a time, the air was unusually tense. Then a soldier carrying a machine gun patrolled back and forth. The pedestrians became more and more suspicious. While I was surprised, a car entered the station. The soldiers rushed forward to greet him. I saw Minister Song slowly get out of the car. He was wearing a white serge Western suit and a white hat. He was tall and burly. He was wearing glasses. At that time, the military police along the way shouted "Attention!" and raised their hands in salute. Song smiled and answered them.</p>
<p>Li Zhaohuan on a Rickshaw Li Zhaohuan is the Permanent Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways. He also serves as the Vice President of Jiaotong University. He comes to the school three days a week and spends the rest of the days in Beijing. He travels between Beijing and Shanghai, not shirking his hard work. He comes to the school to work very early every day. Sometimes he only takes a rickshaw. He travels lightly and simply. The public doesn't know that he is the president. It is also heard that although he is the Vice Minister, he is still not married. Chinese people often like to marry early. Some even boast about love when their personal economy is not independent. Looking at Mr. Li, the difference between the worthy and the unworthy is far away.</p>
<h3>New Capital, Old Tales</h3>
<p>— Li Taoan</p>
<p>There is a certain prominent family in Nanjing. Their surname cannot be verified. They practice the religion of Muhammad and are devout believers. Those who know the history of their ancestors always tell it. Those who hear it are fascinated by its tactful and moving nature.</p>
<p>During the Tongzhi and Guangxu years of the late Qing Dynasty, domestic transportation was not yet developed. Travelers had to rely on boats, carts, and horses to travel. A certain Jia from Anhui lived in Baixia, working as a donkey driver. For many years, he whipped his donkey and held the lantern, running around and following people. He looked extremely tired. But he was very honest and decisive in his dealings. He was good at observing people's expressions and was very popular. A certain new noble, with matters to report, went to the province to meet with the emperor. He left his travel suitcase on the road. The suitcase contained many confidential documents. He searched everywhere but could not find it. He was very worried. He posted notices in the thoroughfares, hoping to get it back. It happened that a certain Jia found it. He immediately returned it to the owner. The owner saw that he was simple and pleasing and appreciated him greatly. He kept him for his own use. Soon, the certain noble opened a government in Jiangnan. His power and position were prominent. Jia also attached himself to the tail of the horse and rose to fame. He rose rapidly. Before long, his mansion was continuous. He was like a great family. At that time, a certain uninhibited celebrity, who had a bumpy life and was not used by the world, had prominent bones and was a strange figure in the literary world. He asked about the events of his humble beginnings. He satirized him with poetry. The poem was passed down in the literary world and spread as a beautiful tale. One sentence said: "Blue feather of the fifth rank hangs the court beads. How majestic and great a man. Do you remember the wind and snow on Ba Bridge? Waving the whip and calling Du Du." The end said Du Du, which is onomatopoeic. It captures the spirit perfectly. The words are especially humorous but not abusive. They express the ability to tease, anger, laugh, and scold to the fullest. When a certain Jia heard it, he could do nothing about it. He just smiled it off.</p>
<h3>After Reading Hu Zijing's Book</h3>
<p>— He An</p>
<p>Changsha was burned and killed by the Communist bandits, creating an unprecedented catastrophe. The reports carried before on the killing of Mr. Hu Zijing. Yesterday I suddenly met him in Hanyang. I asked about everything. I learned that because he had just returned from mourning his wife and was unable to take on the position, he strongly declined the presidency of Hunan University. He did not avoid the turmoil in advance and was trapped in the city. The rumors arose because of this. Mr. Hu founded Mingde School in the Gui Mao year of the previous Qing Dynasty. It has been 28 years since then. He has been running around for school funds and has spared no effort. He is honest and upright. He does not take anything improperly. He has no private savings. Society respects him for this. Because Mr. Hu has gained the sympathy of society, he is still running around at the age of 60, not knowing that his old age is coming. He cannot be compared with Ye Dehui, who is arrogant and does not follow the rules. When Mingde was first founded, it was a middle school. Later, it was a normal elementary school and a higher elementary school. In the second year of the Republic of China, a university was established in Beijing. In the eighth year, another university was established in Hankou, planning to move to Beiping. In the fourteenth year, it was closed due to insufficient funds. In Changsha, he focused on running the middle school and greatly expanded it. After the establishment of the National Government, he was rewarded. Last August, the Hunan government hired him as the president of Hunan University. It was near the start of school. He came out to maintain it. For a year, he deeply felt that he could not take care of both. He still wanted to focus all his efforts on maintaining Mingde and carrying out his original intention of hard work and sincerity. He Yunqiao and Mr. Hu have no teacher-student relationship and rarely meet. His position at Hunan University was not because of He Yunqiao personally, but to do his best for education in Hunan. Mr. Hu has never engaged in political life for decades. Everyone in the country knows this. To say that he took the position of president in his later years to seek the position of provincial affairs officer is even more inappropriate. Those who know Mr. Hu will laugh. He An has known Mr. Hu for the longest time. When Mr. Hu was raising money in Nanyang, I helped him. From this, I know the matter very well. Many of the sections recorded by Mr. Fang Er are inconsistent. Therefore, I specially add to the book, and I also show that Mr. Hu is well, to show those in the country who know Mr. Hu.</p>
<h3>A Trip to the Four Caves of Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— He Haisheng, sent from Hangzhou</p>
<p>Hangzhou's famous scenery is the best in the world. Throughout the years, Chinese and foreign men and women come to visit, endlessly. It is almost like being on the Shanyin Road. A few days ago, a friend named Chi Chu came to my house and invited me to visit the Yellow Dragon Cave. It was a cloudy day, as if it would rain. Chi Chu urged me to go. I was afraid of rain along the way and hesitated. Chi Chu said resolutely, "Why don't we take a risk and go?" I followed him. So I put on my clothes and went out together. We took a public bus to Guanyin Station. After getting off the bus, we walked for about three miles.</p>
<p>Yellow Dragon Cave As we approached the door, we saw two ponds on both sides. Further in, there was a pavilion and beautiful houses. There were rockeries all around, exquisite and delicate. There were three tiger mouths on them. Clear springs flowed down. We admired it endlessly. But the cave was still above. So we climbed the steps. After a few dozen steps, there was a Qianlong imperial stele. After a while, we reached our destination. We went straight into the Yellow Dragon. There was nothing in the cave, only piles of rocks. We wandered around for a while and then went down. After coming out, we climbed again.</p>
<p>Purple Cloud Cave The trees along the road reached the sky. Soon we reached the entrance of the cave. Above it was a plaque that said "Cave Heaven Scenic Spot." There were three Buddhas in the cave. Foolish men and women worshiped them. Next to it was the Seven Star Spring. It was dark and nothing could be seen. There were stone benches for guests to sit on. The light was more sufficient than in the Yellow Dragon Cave. Although the exterior was not as good, the interior was better. Chi Chu and I sat down and ate the cakes and pastries we brought to fill our stomachs. But our interest in traveling was not over. We went to visit</p>
<p>Bat Cave There were thousands of bats, gathering inside. The smell was unbearable. Moreover, there was no way to enter the cave. We covered our noses and passed by. We changed our visit to</p>
<p>Golden Drum Cave This is a relic of the Song Dynasty. It is said that Taoists often heard the sound of bells and drums at that time. They searched for it but could not find it. So they named it that way. It is a absurd saying, which seems credible but cannot be fully believed. Outside there is a statue of Lao Tzu. On the right side is a very small cave. It is full of water. The depth of the abyss cannot be measured. There is nothing else to record. When we returned, Chi Chu said proudly, "Today we should drink to celebrate the success of our adventure." So we had a drink at a tavern and parted ways. (With gratitude)</p>
<h3>On Cats</h3>
<p>— Wu Tianni</p>
<p>The nature of cats is gentle and active. They like to live near people. However, if taught properly, they can be useful in some ways. It's just that their intelligence is far inferior to that of dogs. Many young ladies in the country like to keep them, but men rarely accept them. However, the following few points cannot be generalized.</p>
<p>Years ago, my family had a special dog named Lingling. It was of a very good breed, but unfortunately, it had become mixed. Its color was pure black and it was quite small. When it was time to find a mate, it was difficult to find a female dog of the same size. Coincidentally, we had a female cat that was as big as the dog. Suddenly, the dog had a strange idea and often snuggled up to the cat, showing great affection. Ordinary cats are afraid of dogs, but this cat was perfectly at ease. Sometimes it would raise its tail and meow loudly, letting the dog do whatever it wanted. However, cats and dogs are different, and it was difficult for them to truly be together. The mess they left behind was quite laughable. The cat was completely white and became pregnant the following year, giving birth to a pure black kitten. This was definitely not from the dog. But the mother cat was completely white, and the kitten was pure black like a dog, which was also a strange thing. There are truly some unbelievable things in the world. As the kitten grew up, it became very familiar with Lingling. Lingling also loved it very much and would often lie in the doghouse with it. After several months, both the cat and the dog grew up, and their love was as strong as before. But I have been away from my hometown for many years, and I don't know what they are like now.</p>
<p>My aunt, Madam Zhou, is the mother of Meige from Jingzhou. She is a devout Buddhist. She has a Buddhist hall at home, which is very clean. One day, a cat gave birth to a litter on the altar in front of the Buddha. The family thought it was disrespectful to the Buddha, so they moved the kittens to a basket behind the door while the mother cat was away. Unexpectedly, after being moved, the mother cat refused to recognize her kittens. No matter how hard they tried to make her feed them, she ignored them. Now, there are five kittens in total. They have only been born for three days and have been crying all night, starving and waiting to die. Alas, what have they done to deserve this tragedy? I wonder if any readers have a way to make the mother cat change her mind and feed her kittens again.</p>
<h3>A Brief Account of the Two Major Expositions in Belgium (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Liu Zeng, sent from Paris</p>
<p>Antwerp is the cultural center of northwestern Belgium, facing Liège, the cultural center of the southeast. The residents speak the Flamanp language, which is similar to Dutch and German. The nature of the Antwerp Exposition is different from that of the Liège Exposition. It is mainly focused on products from various colonies. China has no colonies and is seeking not to become a colony of others, which is impossible. Of course, we are not qualified to participate in this exposition.</p>
<p>The largest participating countries are France, England, Japan, the Netherlands, and Italy. Each country has built huge buildings to display the harvests of their colonies.</p>
<p>What Chinese visitors find most heartbreaking is the Japanese propaganda about South Manchuria. The purpose of the Japanese participation in this exposition is to promote South Manchuria as their colony to various countries. Therefore, Korea, Taiwan, Ryukyu, and other places are of secondary importance in this exposition. The main focus is South Manchuria. The Japanese have built a special pavilion, full of photos of South Manchuria, statistical tables, and specimens of soybeans and peanuts produced there. In the photos, Chinese people are mostly wearing long robes and melon-shaped hats, being directed by Japanese people in Western suits. According to their statistical tables, South Manchuria now produces 4.6 million tons of soybeans annually, three-quarters of which are used to meet the needs of Europeans. There is also a map showing South Manchuria and Japan painted in the same color. This South Manchurian pavilion also has a lacquered couplet that reads, "Scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants gather in this room," "Gathering the grand sights of the southeast, northwest, and north." The inscription reads "Respectfully presented by Dong Annan Shu Jun, wishing the Great French Empire ten thousand years." Chinese characters are used to sing the praises of the people of a fallen country. Is this not lamentable?</p>
<p>Leaving the Japanese pavilion and entering the French pavilion, there are also things that make people sigh. In addition to doing their best to promote the success of non-colonialism, France has also set up a special room to boast about its achievements in invading the yellow race. This room is the Annam Pavilion. Annam has no special culture of its own. All it has is inherited from China. Therefore, the items on display in the Annam Pavilion are all similar to Chinese items. Each door in the pavilion has a gold-lacquered couplet. The one in the center reads, "The Eastern Sea prays three times, and pearls and jade have always been abundant," "French grace covers the four borders, and wealth and industry compete to open." The inscription reads, "Respectfully presented by Dong Annan Shu Jun, wishing the Great French Empire ten thousand years." Chinese characters are only used by the people of a fallen country to sing praises. Is this not deplorable?</p>
<p>There are many other noteworthy things, but due to the limited space in this newspaper, they are all omitted. In short, according to the reporter's personal opinion, our country had no need to participate in this exposition. (The United States, Germany, and other countries did not participate.) If we want to participate, we should participate on a large scale and with a plan. We should study the psychology of Westerners and pay attention to scientific methods in the selection and display of exhibits, so that in addition to promoting national quintessence, it can also help promote foreign trade.</p>
<p>Correction: The last four lines of yesterday's article should have been placed before the section "Southern Venue..." We hereby correct this.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (260)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 13: Who Unintentionally Plants Fortune and Gains a Diamond Ring? Only This Karma Sings the Golden Thread with Intent</p>
<p>This day, because there were many guests, the hosts were inevitably a little busy. But the other four hosts were fine. Ling Zhixiang was the host of hosts today, and he was even busier, at a loss for what to do. Everyone had to ask this young master Ling about everything. But he found it very interesting. When it came time to drink, he insisted on setting up ten tables of wine at the same time. When it came time to call for entertainment, it was a chaotic scene with flowers flying and branches shaking. When the entertainers arrived, it was even more of a clamor. With seventy or eighty guests, each calling for an entertainer, there were seventy or eighty people. And Ling Zhixiang declared that the more entertainers called, the better. Each person had to call for at least two entertainers. It truly became a scene of "ten thousand people leaving their alleys to celebrate the new dress." All the famous courtesans of Shanghai's northern district were called out. At this time, next to Zuo Shichen, there was a singer, who was very shy with the guests. He was probably a new performer. The one who accompanied him, however, was a charming and sweet elder sister, who was very responsive to the guests and handled everything with ease. It seemed that she had been trained in the brothel, unlike those who came from the countryside. Zuo Shichen thought that even in a brothel, there was economic use of talent. For example, this singer was an outstanding talent. It didn't matter if the person accompanying him was a little less talented. He wouldn't even mind if an old woman came along. If the singer couldn't attract guests, then a supporting talent was indispensable. Especially for newly debuted prostitutes, they relied on a good elder sister to guide them at all times. In the imperial era, when the emperor was young, he relied on several virtuous and loyal ministers to be his teachers and advisors to assist the young ruler. That was the same principle. Zuo Shichen thought this way in his heart, and couldn't help but look over there frequently. He felt that the elder sister who accompanied the entertainer looked somewhat familiar. When she saw Zuo Shichen looking at her, she smiled back at him. The people who accompanied the entertainers used to stand there. Because her position was very close to Zuo Shichen, she walked over and said, "Are you Mr. Zuo? Are you the second young master Zuo?" Zuo Shichen was stunned and said, "How do you know?" She smiled and said, "Don't you remember? I saw you in Cuiyun's room before." When Zuo Shichen heard this, he vaguely remembered, but he couldn't call out her name. So he asked, "What's the name of the entertainer you're accompanying now?" But she didn't answer this question. Instead, she asked Zuo Shichen, "Cuiyun has come out. Have you called her?" Zuo Shichen said, "Really? I didn't know at all. Is she still called Cuiyun? Where is she?" She said, "Her name has been changed to Channong. She's at Baihuadi." Zuo Shichen took a piece of entertainment ticket in his hand and said, "How is it written?" She said, "Chan is the Chan character in the Buddhist and Taoist ceremony. Nong is the Nong character in Wang Xiaonong." Zuo Shichen said, "What a good name, Channong. Who gave her this name?" She said, "I heard that the third elder sister gave it to herself."</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Markets Turn Bullish</h3>
<p>Market Sentiment Remains Volatile: Yesterday, the 22nd, the gold market remained hesitant, prone to drastic changes, with rotations of three to four taels common. The total daily range was nine taels, but it had turned bullish. Foreign exchange rates also showed strength, with banks actively selling. As for the shorts among the brokers, there was some covering, but the public's mood was uncertain, leading to fluctuating prices. Yuan Xing, Yong Yuan Sheng, and others were actively buying, while Tai Kang, Run Han, Heng Wan Xing Shun Li, and others were selling. The market opened high due to strong buying demand in the morning. Although large silver bars were long, they were not considered high. However, due to different supply and demand, prices fluctuated around forty taels. In the afternoon, demand exceeded supply, and Yuan Xing, Yong Yu Da, and others actively bought, leading to a positive trend and quick liquidation, with only two taels remaining.

<h3>Foreign Sales Are Strong Again, Supply Is Sufficient, and Prices Are Stable</h3>
<p>Market Overview: Recently, the sales of foreign silver dollars have been sluggish, starting in the middle of last week. The southern gangs slightly cleared 2-300,000 new dollars daily.

<h3>Strong Sales of Silver Coins and Double Dollars</h3>
<p>Although news of silver coin exports continues daily, the quantities are not large, due to various reasons, it has not been possible to fulfill all wishes. Some places have stopped due to inconvenient transportation. Yesterday, it was heard that there were still over 300,000 loaded in Guangzhou, and Shantou and Xiamen suddenly purchased and loaded over 400,000. The northern route also suddenly wanted to find and purchase millions, and the first shipment was over 500,000, with the rest being reported and shipped gradually. The Dalian gang also ordered a total of over 800,000 jiao from Shanghai this time. It was reported that over 300,000 jiao were loaded the day before, and over 400,000 were reported yesterday. The ship is expected to leave tomorrow morning, so there may still be a continuation today. Now that Shanghai has been so thoroughly scoured, the circulating code of Guangjiao on the market is feeling insufficient, so the price increase is inevitable. It is said that there is still a one-cent difference, so the listed exchange rate is only 11 jiao 3-4 fen per foreign dollar.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Fall by Several Jiao Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, futures for various public bonds were still good, but the spot market was calm as before. The trend of various bonds was slightly favorable, softening in the early morning and falling lower in the second session. However, buying interest was stronger in the later session, hovering and rising, but still weaker than the previous day. Except for the disarmament spot market, which fell by more than three yuan, and the 6% Customs Reorganization and Disarmament spot market and the Disarmament August futures, which fell by about one yuan and several jiao, the others only fell by three or four jiao. The total daily spot transaction volume was 19,000 yuan, and the futures continued to reach over 13.7 million yuan.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Bidding Market Maintains Stability</h3>
<p>The yarn market remains firm, but American cotton continues to fall. The reason why people in this city are bullish is that buyers are holding tight and not letting go. The season is in the autumn sales period, and they are deeply afraid that actual sales will develop in large quantities. Moreover, the Tianjin gang has recently purchased a huge amount of futures, so most people are optimistic. Osaka's Sanpin yarn is relatively stable due to reduced production.</p>
<p>Human Bidding Benefited by Sanpin's Rise: The human bidding market opened down in the morning, following foreign cotton, but later it became firm again as bulls bought in. As a result, each month rose by 1, 2, and 3 qian. In the afternoon, as Osaka's Sanpin yarn rose, people became even more nervous, and each month rose by 1, 3, 4, and 5 qian. The total daily transaction volume was 12,300 bales. Da Feng sold 1,050 bales, Shen Chang 900 bales, Heng Yi 600 bales, and Ji Feng, Chang Ji, Yu Kang, Sen Kang, Li Chang, Zhu Cheng, and Guang Feng, Shen Ji, 300-600 bales. Gong Tai Jin bought 950 bales, Rong Xing 900 bales, Qin Feng 800 bales, and Heng Da, Da Fu, He Shen, Yi Yu, and Yuan Tai, 200-350 bales. The closing prices for the human bidding are recorded below.</p>

<p>Actual Sales Only 675 Bales: The actual yarn sales are sluggish. The total daily purchase volume by various gangs was 675 bales, with 150 bales of inland futures, 500 bales of Tianjin futures, 710 bales among peers, 500 bales of actual Sichuan goods, 40 bales of Tianjin goods, 20 bales of Guangdong goods, 100 bales of Qingdao goods, and 115 bales of miscellaneous gangs.</p>
<h3>Recent Hankow Standard Remarkably Popular</h3>
<p>The cotton market experienced a morning decline followed by an afternoon surge. American cotton fell another twenty points, while local bullish sentiment remained high. Bullish firms for the current month found it difficult to maintain their positions, transferring and settling their contracts with a certain manufacturer at a price of 32.5 taels. Consequently, this manufacturer re-entered the cotton futures market, increasing their holdings, purchasing four to five thousand bales over two days. Short covering occurred, causing the market to become volatile and slightly rise. Distant months were also affected.</p>
<p>Hankow Standard was weak in the morning but strengthened in the afternoon. At the opening of the morning session, the market sentiment was extremely weak, following the decline of foreign cotton by 2.5 to 3 mace. In the afternoon, due to the current month's influence, distant months rose, slightly strengthening the market. The current month rose by 5 mace, and distant months rose by 2.5 mace. The total daily trading volume was 57,600 bales. Sales included 3,300 bales by Shenchang, 2,200 bales by Qinfeng, 1,900 bales each by Dachangcheng and Maoji, 1,800 bales by Lichang, and 1,200 to 1,900 bales each by Yichang, Taichang, Yukang, Tianchang, Jinfeng, Xiesheng, Dafu, Daji, and Taixing. Purchases included 1,200 bales by Hengda, 3,000 bales by Changji, 2,900 bales by Yuda, 5,300 bales by Taixing, and 3,300 bales by Yiyu, and 2,400 bales by Dafeng. The closing prices for Hankow Standard are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Manufacturers Adopt a Wait-and-See Approach to Spot Goods</p>
<p>The spot cotton business remains stagnant. Factories are taking a wait-and-see approach due to weak foreign cotton prices and favorable weather conditions. Additionally, low-priced Indian cotton is also being peddled.</p>

<h3>Another Downturn in the World Cotton Market</h3>

British cotton futures fell by 5 to 6 points, while spot goods remained unchanged. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by 15 points. The Indian cotton market was closed.

<h3>Statistics on China's Cotton Industry in the First Half of the Year</h3>
<p>Increasing Number of Spindles… Growing Imports of Foreign Cotton</p>
<p>The China Merchants Yarn Factory Association recently released the following statistics on the transfer of spindles and consumption and inventory of raw cotton by various spinning mills in the first half of this year (raw cotton inventory and consumption are measured in units of 500-pound bales):</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Consumption This Year, First Half Last Year, Second Half Raw Cotton Inventory This Year, First Half Last Year, Second Half</p>
<p>Chinese Cotton 770785 762017 226796 246750</p>
<p>American Cotton 161520 129647 58415 44600</p>
<p>Indian Cotton 164218 198746 128975 51288</p>
<p>Egyptian Cotton 1584 861 1420 1637</p>
<p>Other 5166 1251 950 482</p>
<p>Total 1203273 1092522 416556 344757</p>
<p>Spindle Count ▲Suspended Operation</p>
<p>Actual Operating Count 3827900 3699402</p>
<p>Number of Suspended Spindles 448416 565831</p>
<p>Under Construction 200950 180940</p>
<p>Hours Suspended 1320 1837</p>
<p>Weeks Suspended 1.25 2.13</p>
<p>Observing the above statistics, two points are worth noting: (1) China's spinning industry is gradually progressing, and (2) the demand for foreign cotton is increasing. China's spinning industry has been relatively successful since the year before last, and there have been frequent reports of adding spindles and establishing factories. Although it has been slightly affected recently by exchange rate fluctuations, as of the end of June, the actual number of spindles operating (referring to yarn spindles; thread spindles and waste cotton spindles are not included) was 3,827,900, with 200,950 spindles under installation, bringing the total to nearly 4 million. The actual number of spindles operating has increased by more than 128,000 compared to the end of last year. If politics become more stable, the future prospects are promising. However, it should be noted that Japanese merchants account for 39% of this number, and British merchants account for a little over 4%. It is hoped that the government and the people will maintain and promote its development to prevent the continued growth of foreign commercial power.</p>
<p>During the first half of the year, the consumption of raw cotton increased with the increase in yarn spindles, but the increase rate of foreign cotton was greater than that of Chinese cotton, and the same is true for inventories. This has a significant impact on China's cotton production. It is found that China's cotton production in recent years has been approximately 5 to 6 million bales, which is far from sufficient to meet the consumption of spinning mills. Moreover, the quality is coarse and short, making it unsuitable for fine spinning. The fiber of Lingbao cotton in Henan Province is relatively fine and long and can be used to spin yarn of 32 counts or higher. However, the quantity is small and there are signs of degradation, so finer yarn must be spun with cotton from the United States and Egypt. The import of foreign cotton is therefore huge. Examining the customs trade register, the import surplus of cotton in recent years has approached 100 million Customs taels. It is truly alarming for a country that relies on agriculture to have such a large import surplus of agricultural products. There is great danger for both agriculture and industry. Therefore, expanding production and improving quality are urgent matters for revitalizing the cotton industry.</p>
<h3>Food Prices Plunge in the Rice Market Downriver</h3>
<p>Zhabei</p>
<p>Yesterday, the source of inland rice transfers was shifting, and market sales were poor. Although the stock of northern Japonica rice in Shanghai was not large, store inventories were sufficient. Therefore, while top-quality Japonica rice remained at 21 yuan, ordinary Zhongguan rice fell by 2 to 3 jiao. In some cases, the price fell by as much as half a yuan, resulting in a very soft market. The future of Japonica rice prices depends on the lower reaches of the market. Once Western Xin rice is released, the accumulated stock in Changshu and Wuxi will inevitably be sold off. Furthermore, the price of foreign rice has been weak recently, Xiang rice will soon be shipped, and this year's output of Dongxin Japonica rice is expected to be twice as high as in previous years, arriving in Shanghai every morning at around 1,000 shi. Therefore, although the supply of broken Japonica rice in Shanghai is limited, it will not have much impact. Currently, factories are gradually selling off their stocks, causing the market to fall by half a yuan yesterday, opening high at 19 yuan and trending downward. Demand from new customers for top-quality rice was weak, with prices falling by 1 to 2 jiao. Can Yang top-quality rice saw some support,勉開 at around 15 yuan. Shipments of Baiyuan rice increased, but sales were sluggish. Top-quality rice was at a premium of a little over half a jiao, opening at 19.3 to 19.4 yuan. Market expectations were focused on 19 yuan. Across the board, prices of all types of rice plunged sharply yesterday, resulting in a very soft market.</p>
<p>South Shanghai</p>
<p>Prices downriver saw some support, but street sales were weak. The price of northern broken white rice also fell by 3 jiao, and the trend is expected to follow the northern market. Ordinary rice prices hovered around 20 yuan. Incoming shipments of southern thin-husked rice were slightly received but also fell by 1 to 2 jiao, with top-quality rice opening at 20.05 to 20.06 yuan. Demand for Bianyuan rice was weak, with prices generally around the 19 yuan mark.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice: High-Grade Weak, Medium-Grade Popular</h3>
<p>Yesterday, secondary rice from the mainland being shipped by agents enlivened the foreign rice market. Transactions of various types of rice, including Da Xiaojiao and Min Dang rice, increased, and prices became more favorable. However, the stock of No. 1 Saigon rice was not large, and digestion was slow, causing the market to move in the opposite direction to that of medium-grade rice. The market opened with 500 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice at 16 yuan to 15.8 yuan, slightly lower than before. 300 bags of No. 2 Saigon rice were priced at 14.16 yuan, 2,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice were priced at 15 yuan to 14.6 yuan, 1,500 bags of Dajiao rice were priced at 12.4 yuan, 60 bags of Hong Dajiao rice were priced at 11.7 to 11.8 yuan, and 60 bags of Min Dang rice were priced at 15.22 to 14.85 yuan, all slightly higher than the previous market.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Manipulated by Bulls</h3>
<p>Gold Prices Rebound… Short Sellers Must Gradually Cover Positions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed another improving trend. Since the current month has been largely absorbed by bullish speculators, the amount of short positions held by insiders is limited. Outside short sellers have no choice but to gradually cover their positions in the face of this forced price increase. Although prices of foreign wheat for distant months have been reported to be down by about 1 to 2 jiao, the gold market has rebounded, which has inevitably influenced sentiment. Given this situation, if demand picks up, the large bullish speculators will inevitably drive prices higher and higher. Otherwise, there will be complaints, and excessive manipulation will likely be avoided. As a result, the current month was up by 1 fen and 2.5 li compared to the previous day, September was up by 1.5 fen, October, December, and January were up by 1 fen, and November was up by 7.5 li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Open Higher and Rise Steadily</h3>
<p>Yesterday, wheat futures prices continued to rise across the board, especially for the current month. As the current month approaches delivery, the inventory in the market, although estimated to be around 60,000 to 70,000, is mostly medium and secondary grade, with few high-quality goods. Those that meet the exchange's standards are even scarcer. Therefore, the exchange's standard goods are like rare commodities due to delivery requirements. Thus, after the opening price, prices opened higher and rose steadily, creating a short squeeze. September also saw a significant rise due to its proximity to the current month, while distant months remained relatively stable. As a result, the current month was up by 6 fen compared to the previous day, September was up by 4 fen, and October to January were up by 2 fen each. Spot wheat prices fell by 4 to 5 fen because the goods were of medium and secondary quality and did not meet the factory's requirements. More than 4,000 bales of wheat from Xuzhou, Yaowan, Huangqiao, and Niuzhuang were opened and acquired by Fuxin and Fufeng.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Sales of Both Domestic and Foreign Goods Are Very Quiet</h3>
<p>Local Cotton Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday's market was slightly soft due to the decline in American cotton and the approaching end of August. Fine cloth was down by a small amount of 5 fen, fine twill was down by a small amount of 2.5 fen. There was a shortage of coarse cloth, and definite orders for coarse twill from the Wentaibang were for 50 to 60 pieces. 16-pound Five Yuanbao was sold at 7 taels, 5 mace, and 7.5 fen. 14-pound Ren Ta was sold at 6 taels and 3.5 qian, 11-pound Mao Ya was sold at 5 taels. There were slight transactions of Yihhe bleached cloth from the Jinbang, with Jin Santai at 7 taels and 6 qian, and Yunwai Piaoxiang at 7 taels and 8 qian.</p>
<p>East and West Piece Goods</p>
<p>Actual sales were stagnant as people adopted a wait-and-see approach. Holders of goods had to pay to extend their financing, and the market was weak. The quietness of transactions was rarely seen. Dark-colored and patterned Ting cloth had reached around 9 qian. Shui Lang Rong was down by a small amount of 2.5 li, and Guang Xie was also quite weak. Shile Bird fine cloth fell by 1 qian, selling at 7 taels and 7 qian, and bleached cloth was down by a small amount of 5 fen. Queqiao Hui was at 10 taels and 7 qian, Huaniao was at 7 taels and 3.5 qian, and Shichong was at 7 taels and 7 qian. However, Zhigong Ni and Zhigong Duan remained firm. Western goods, Chongtai Western satin, were added to by the Changjiangbang yesterday, with Sassoon Tianguan at 3 qian and 3.5 fen, and Gongping Jiucai Tong at 3 qian and 3 fen. Thick Zhigong Ni also saw slight movement.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Zhenmei Green Tea Sales to England Show Slight Movement</h3>
<p>Incoming Zhenmei green tea from the tea estates, Yingzhuang Jinlong, Tianxiang, Duode, and other firms, all had telegraphic transfers yesterday. However, because the initial orders were extended, the market price fell by 5 to 6 taels. Items such as Zhenmei Zhucha also saw some scattered transactions, with no price increases or decreases. The most important issue, the sale of Chinese tea to Russia, was previously suspended due to the arrest of a tea agent in Hankou. Yesterday, a telegraphic dispatch from Hankou stated that the military authorities in Wuhan had agreed to release the Russian agent, and tea sales seemed unaffected.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Lower-Grade Guangdong Lychees Open with Tight Prices</h3>
<p>Lower-grade Guangdong lychees have recently seen a lively market and firm prices. Yesterday, new goods were opened on the market. Shuidong lychees opened at over 16 taels, selected Zhuang lychees opened at around 13 taels, and those below that opened at around 11 taels, all up by about 2 taels compared to the previous low prices. Since the prices are relatively affordable and easy to sell, the market price is trending upward despite the large supply.</p>

<p>Yesterday's rice market situation in South Shanghai: five ships arrived, market sales were lackluster. Thin japonica rice, thick japonica rice, Saigon rice, and Min Dang small polished rice each fell by a few cents. The remaining goods were weak. Only Changshu and northern Jiangsu japonica rice, Bian Yuan rice, and early rice were not available for market reports.</p>

<h3>Chilean Government Undertakes Abolition of the Death Penalty</h3>
<p>Submitting a new criminal law proposal to the National Congress, working hard for the happiness of children</p>
<p>According to the World News Agency, the New York-published "Chile" monthly magazine reports that the Chilean government has recently drafted a new criminal law proposal and submitted it to the National Congress. The content of the new criminal law is entirely based on new concepts of criminal law science and the scientific progress of psychology, sociology, and biology. The aim is to abolish the death penalty and life imprisonment, focusing on crime prevention rather than punishment. The sentencing of an offender places great emphasis on considering their personal background and environment. The criminal laws of countries such as Switzerland, Germany, and Sweden were used as blueprints during the drafting process. Among the innovative provisions are: (1) Fines are determined based on the offender's income and economic obligations; (2) Imprisonment periods are not fixed, but rather flexible based on the offender's ability to reform; (3) The culpability of accomplices is equal to that of the perpetrators. Regarding the implementation of this new criminal law, the Chilean government has established a major prison reform plan, which is currently underway. This includes the construction of modern new prison buildings, improvement of prison procedures, and the scientific management of prisons.</p>
<p>The monthly magazine also reports that from July 4th to 11th, Peru held the Sixth Pan-American Child Conference. Chile made significant contributions to this conference. Chile is currently engaged in extensive improvements to the well-being of children, with particular emphasis on addressing the issue of juvenile delinquency. There are regulations for maternity benefits for nursing mothers, and the National Child Welfare Association has established free milk distribution agencies in various locations to specifically donate to mothers from poor families. In the past six months of the year, the milk distribution stations in Santiago have nourished 1,293 children, with medical assistance provided in 14,362 cases. Every elementary school in the country has a doctor who enforces compulsory medical treatment for students to improve their health. The handling of juvenile delinquency is now being improved using scientific methods. Old-fashioned orphanages are now being replaced by social group-style remedial education institutions. These educational institutions contain a family atmosphere to help children forget the pain of being orphaned.</p>
<h3>Europe and America Enter an Era of Large-Scale Ship Layups</h3>
<p>Europe: 6 Million Tons; America: Over 200 Vessels</p>
<p>Last year, the European shipping industry had virtually no ship layups. However, between last winter and this spring, due to a sharp drop in freight rates, Europe began to have substantial ship layups in January of this year, with the number confirmed to be 100,000 tons. By February, it had reached 500,000 tons; in March, it reached 1 million tons; and in April, it increased to 3 million tons. It now exceeds 6 million tons. This means that approximately 15% of Europe's current 40 million tons of shipping capacity is laid up.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Captain Jones of the Prince Line's China Prince, there are currently over 200 ships laid up in America. Along the Atlantic coast, these ships are lying empty, awaiting orders, presenting a strange spectacle reminiscent of a grand naval review.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education of Japan Possesses 40,000 Volumes</h3>
<p>3,000 Missing Books Found</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch: A major panic has broken out within the Ministry of Education of Japan. Since the earthquake, the Ministry has purchased approximately 40,000 books annually, freely lending them out to various departments for the use of staff. Recently, while organizing the purchase ledgers, it was discovered that approximately 3,000 books were missing. Most of these are expensive Western books that are difficult for individuals to obtain, with a total value exceeding ten thousand yuan. The Expenditure Section, due to the unexpected nature of the incident, is currently conducting a more detailed investigation. The cause of the missing books appears to be that they were borrowed and left at home, and then forgotten to be returned due to personnel transfers and dismissals, etc. It is also suspected that some intentionally took them home with no intention of returning them. The Ministry will soon hold a meeting to discuss a solution.</p>
