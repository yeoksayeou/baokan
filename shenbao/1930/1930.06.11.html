<h3>西哈諾的作者歇斯當</h3>
<p>爲了復旦劇社的定在本月十日上演歇斯當的西哈諾我們這裏覺得有介紹一下這位偉大的浪漫劇作家的必要　　我們知道歇斯當所處的法國是正當寫實派大師大仲馬布薩克福祿貝爾左拉等人的自然主義以及外來的易卜生霍普特曼等人的社會問題劇的作品充滿了劇壇大家正感着無限的疲倦所以曷斯當一出乃復以浪漫主義相號召而使得觀衆再度地沈醉在這想像濃烈的醇漿中　　法國向來是古典主義的發源地一切傳統的觀念因襲的勢力却是鞏固畢業一班人們的思想也自然地因之而偏於頑固的方面在這種情况之下而硬要改革一般人守舊的腦筋當然是件很難的事記得在囂俄的（歐那尼）出世了後浪漫派在法國獲得了相當的地位而我們的曷斯當則在幾世紀以後又以他的（西哈諾）的英雄重引鼓起浪漫派的熱情　　本來浪漫派最大的特徴就是在熱情就是在描寫人類内部生命對於外界物象的傾注和燃燒牠並不像自然主義那樣的專趨向理智和技巧而偏向於理想美化一方面　　明瞭了這一點那我們可以知道曷斯當决不會像福祿貝爾或布薩克一樣地在描寫人物的時候必定要去努力搜索考證以求叙述的正確而乃是專心致志地憧憬於美去自由地發出作者自己個人的情感　　同時他能夠把純粹的詩想移入戲劇而得到成功他能夠不顧當時的風尚而將這大家在業已認爲死去的詩想移入戲劇他本着浪漫派大無畏的精神抵拒一切腐舊的勢力擺脱一切覊束的紀律而任自己的情感去奔放　　他的劇材通常表現一種輕巧的愛情與冒險的情調令人讀着時便覺得宛然可愛不過我們最後得知道的是曷斯當並不是像莎士比亞那樣地偉大我們當然不能以十全十美來責之有的人説曷斯當是法國人所以不免終歸屬於頽廢悲觀·病弱而除此以外便没有别樣了法國近代文學史的著者拉魯氏也批評西哈諾有許多地方充滿缺陷像劇情穿插的嘈雜心理描寫的粗略詩句的俚格韻脚的强湊等　　曷斯當以一八九九年四月一日生於馬賽文爲當地之著名雜誌記者及經濟學家曷氏幼時在馬賽受初等教育後入巴黎的法律學院可是乾燥的法律智識却萬不足以滿足我們這位偉大的天才的欲望於是乃改學文學　　曷氏第一個劇本爲一個諷刺的喜劇劇名（小説家）共三幕以一八九四年五月上演於法蘭西劇院此劇本以美巧而精緻的諷刺見稱次年一八九五又寫成（盧滑德公主）共四幕至一八九六年（西哈諾）出曷氏之名乃隨之而傳佈到世界各國而一班批評家都公認之爲從囂俄的（歐那尼）而後没有别的詩劇有過這樣偉大的造就的所以這個劇本一出便立刻被譯成英·德·俄·及其他各國文字　　此後曷氏又寫成一六幕詩劇劇名（小鶯）以一九○○年在皮恩哈特劇塲上演這裏面以新鮮的文筆來寫出一個帶諷刺情調的劇情他這種明顯的筆跡很燦然地表現着他所特有的年青愉快的趣味中間很瑣屑地叙述著一個貧弱的小英雄以及他所遭遇的一切頽廢的環境使得人家感到者（西哈諾）還要强盛的力量不過比較上没有像西哈諾那樣地顯著　　當着一個天才發表了他最大的傑作而後我們和他自己一樣地都會擔心着他不會再有像這樣的劇本産生出來了因爲我們知道天才只是一時的人有時候他的文思會（夢筆生華）樣忽然怒發以後便不易再有這種機會了不過在讀了（小鶯）而後這個擔心可以放下了　　在一九一○年曷斯當又寫了一個四幕的劇本題名（歌者）這是代表曷氏的人生哲學的他在這裏而藉了一個雄鷄來表現人類在世上爲着愛而努力的事實雄鷄當然並不是什麽了不得的東西但是牠的自負心却很高牠以爲那個每天很光榮的太陽是被牠喔喔的啼聲所呌出來的所以牠對於自己的職業工作熱烈地有着信心不過牠後來發現太陽竟不需要牠的啼聲也可以照常地出來的時候牠失望極了牠平日的信仰一槪都被毁壞了於是牠不得不感到幻滅的悲哀可是當牠最後想到他還有雄鷄的愛時牠便又恢復了昔日的一切了這種獨出心裁的情愛描寫當然是很易感動人的　　最後得附帶聲明一句而爲曷氏的生平作一結束的是在一九○二年曷氏被選爲法蘭國家學會的會員曷氏卒於一九一八年（佑）</p>
<h3>法學院之運動會</h3>
<p>我們學校雖然不是體育專門同時也不是執海上各大學運動的牛耳但我們同學業於體育一科却還有相當注意據我所知道的有什麽玫瑰籃球隊等等的組織在學校方面有必條科的軍事訓練每晨天剛破曉的時光就聽見操塲上那清脆而宏亮的口令聲整齊而肅靜的革履聲惟女同學對於體育方面似乎太清沉了　　前天我們校裏又照例地舉行一次運動食地點在先施運動塲參加的同學倒不少女同學也有十五六位以上學校裏預備的奬品銀杯銀盾·金牌·銀牌等不下十來種想届時必有一番盛况是日早晨我們全房間的姊妹們一體出席參觀在我們以爲很早哩那知許多同學和教務長以及其它教職員都先我們而到了我寰覩了週塲却瞧不見一個女運動員只是一班糾糾武夫的健兒們｜男運動員似乎特别精神煥發的引人注目這時我雖然對男同學起了敬意但對於女同學却不能不起了懷疑爲什麽好們旣然簽了名參加運動衣鞋都領去了忽爾臨塲不到其中必有原因　　别也罷了倒弄得我們去參觀的人難乎爲情許多人都這樣説一爲什麽一個女運動員不到女同學没面子是與你們面子有關她們不來你們也該臨時參加）更有少數同學叫起來（好歡迎來賓參加）其實他們明明認識我們是本校同學而偏故意地説着（來賓參加）這不顯然是在笑我們袖手旁觀懦弱無能麽在這種環境之中我們也只好聽之但我的腦袋裏却不能不深深地刻着已經簽名的她們爲什麽不來參加的疑問雖然在這無可如何的情况下而我依然地暗自祈禱着希望她們午後能夠降臨那也未爲晚也　　下午我因聽盧博士的演講｜是本校法學研究會敦請來的｜所以未看運動會直等到第二天大會的結果揭示時我才知道女同學始終是未參加呵我是多麽地失望想女生組的錦標又要和遠東的足球錦標一樣置諸下届了男生組的個人總第一是號稱Ｌonybelloa之黄鉅英與大力土之傳綬兩同學　　而女同學之不出席在我還是釋不了這個疑團果爾無意中竟會得了眞消息據説是這樣的在籌備期間徴求同學參加分兩本簽名簿一本男子組的另一本是女子組的不料有一位男同學未曾注意誤將名字簽到女子組的簿子上去了而籌備會執事者因全校同學太多的緣故所以也不辨誰爲男同學誰爲女同學於是以訛傳訛地將一位男子排入女子組去了在他們是全然不知可是在一班女同學看來則以爲籌備會裏故意尋開心因而中止參加其實簡則是一塲莫虚有的滑稽誤會　　因了這點區區誤會以致會塲上遂形成了男性世界實不免可惜却也可説是在法學院運動會史册上留下滑稽的一頁</p>
<h3>復旦兩同樂大會</h3>
<p>在每一個學期行將結束的時候照例地有同樂大會的（皆大歡喜）　　是以在六日八日的一天江灣的復旦就同時有兩個遊藝大會　　一個是商學會的游藝大會｜　　（鬢光釵影天上人間奚殊車水馬龍風輕月淡始知）這是校裏五日刊的編者用來形容其盛况的其節目之重要者爲（一）霍慧貞女士之粤曲獨唱（二）沃敏女士陳艷水女士之春到人間（三）劉小我女士張素貞女士之覺悟少年（四）張素貞女士之長願曲（五）毛女士之水手舞不必舉了已是洋洋乎大觀了　　這正投了熱血的大學生之所好宜乎呌好之聲不絶不絶也　　又一個是社會學系的同樂大會｜（戲劇·跳舞·音樂·都有·教授·同學·校工·請來·）這又是五日刊的編者的形容詞好來邑來看一下吧　　節目是（一）孫鳳石女士周秀芳女士之雙簧（二）季婉宜女士成言方女士之鋼琴合奏（三）啓英女校之金铃舞龍虎鬥比較上是比商科學會稍多了何况還有（四）誰是瘋子獨幕劇（五）一個捲逃公欵的人獨幕劇（六）最後的失望喜劇等的三個劇本呢　　於是科學院的一○一號大課堂中不再聽到諄諄善導的教授的演講而滿佈變態的拍掌聲了（徽茵）</p>

<p>Second Sheet) Wednesday (6th) Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Simon Commission on the Indian Question</h3>
<p>The Indian Constitutional Investigation Commission organized by British political parties is of utmost importance to the future of the Indian national movement. The findings and proposals of the investigation commission will serve as the basis for the government's handling of the Indian issue in the future. Therefore, the publication of its report is attracting worldwide attention. At the beginning of the organization of the Simon Commission, the Indian people regarded it as an intention to despise Indian nationalism, or suspected that it was using the pretext of reforming Indian administration to consolidate the government's ruling position, or suspected that it would slightly grant benefits to the Indian people to ease the atmosphere of the movement. Therefore, it caused a very drastic anti-resistance storm, and the movement for independence became more urgent. Later, internal division occurred in India, and a part of the people changed their attitude towards the Simon Commission and suddenly cooperated with it, and decided to abandon the proposition of independence and only asked for the approval of the status of autonomous colonies. A constitution was drafted and handed over to the investigation commission to show that the demands of the Indian people were not extravagant. Therefore, it also aroused the opposition of the majority of the masses, and further demanded immediate and complete independence. Since the relationship between the Simon Commission and India is like this, the commission, in order to comfort the hopes of the Indian people and dispel their doubts, must not take the intentions of this part of the people in the past as their intention, but take the demands of the majority of the people today as their demands, and fully report the true public opinion and the true situation of the movement to the government, so as to wash away the previous British-Indian resistance and enable the government to have an accurate new policy, which is beneficial to the overall situation. Otherwise, the journey of 21,000 miles and the time of two and a half years may be in vain. The movement of resistance of the Indian people is neither military resistance, nor can it be curbed by force, nor can it be eliminated by empty words. It lies in the careful examination of the trend, the familiar power of the times, and the ability to cope with it. Now, the report of the investigation commission only includes the general idea, and the important issues discussed only list the main points. Therefore, the true intentions of the members of the commission are not yet clear, and it is not yet possible to predict how the report will affect the Indian movement in the future.

<h3>Seventh Congress of the Mongolian Conference</h3>
<p>Passed the Examination Reports of Various Groups Nanjing: The Mongolian Conference held its seventh congress at 3 PM on the afternoon of the 10th. Forty-three representatives attended, and nineteen representatives were present. Zhang Wohua, the chairman, first discussed the examination report submitted by the second examination group. A. Article 13 of the Regulations on the Registration of Mongolian Lama Temples: Delete the phrase "or equal to the Mongolian official agency of the League." The original text was amended to read: After the first registration is completed, the handling agency, such as the Mongolian Banner Public Office, should prepare a register and report it to the League Chief Public Office for record. The League Chief Public Office should compile the case every six months and report it to the Mongolian Tibetan Affairs Commission once. Mongolian banners that do not belong to the League should directly prepare a register and report it to the Mongolian Tibetan Affairs Commission. The registration format will be determined separately. B. The seven judicial cases proposed by the representatives of each League and Banner were examined and proposed to amend and improve the outline of the Mongolian judicial method as follows: 1. The Mongolian local area should actively prepare for the establishment of an independent judicial organ by the Judicial Yuan in the banner rule, county rule, or other suitable location. However, before the establishment of an independent judicial organ, judicial affairs will remain as they were. 2. The jurisdiction of the Mongolian local independent judicial organ will be delineated separately according to the situation of each place, and will not be restricted by the administrative area of the banner county. 3. Independent judicial organs that have been established and will be established in the future in Mongolian local areas must refer to Mongolians as judges and prosecutors, and must set up Mongolian translators and lawsuit drafting offices to facilitate the litigation of Mongolians. The method of referring to Mongolian personnel will be determined separately. 4. Mongolian local areas may set up civil mediation offices and handle them in accordance with the Civil Mediation Law promulgated by the National Government. 5. Mongolian hereditary nobles, lamas, and other private individuals must not accept or handle judicial cases. 6.

<h3>US Ambassador Johnson Arrives in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Talks with Wang Boqun Nanjing: US Ambassador Johnson arrived in Nanjing from Hankou on the evening of the 9th. He paid a visit to Wang Boqun, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, at 10:00 AM on the 10th and had extensive discussions on China's international communications. The following is a record of the talks: Johnson asked whether the Chinese government's international communications would not be monopolized by the Daibei and Daitong companies and whether it would set up its own wireless radio station. He said that when the construction is successful in the future, the US wireless radio station would like to seek cooperation with the radio station set up by the Chinese government for practical communication. Wang replied that the international radio station being prepared by the Ministry in Shanghai is expected to communicate with European and American countries around September and will cooperate with the US radio station to achieve the effect of international communication. The Ministry is currently planning in detail. Johnson asked about the progress of the negotiations between the Chinese government and the British Daibei and Danish Daibei submarine cable companies to revise the contract. Wang replied that the Daibei and Daitong submarine cables were set up by the two companies during the troubled times of the Qing government, and then they requested recognition. Their contracts contained many unequal intentions, such as the right to land the submarine cable and the freedom to establish a company to send and receive telegrams in China's territory, which meant that they enjoyed a patent right in China, which hinders China's telecommunications sovereignty. Moreover, the contract of the company will expire at the end of this year and will be abolished. Therefore, the Ministry convened representatives of the company in April and held the first meeting at the Ministry to exchange views and discuss other new methods. After the representatives returned to Shanghai, the Ministry sent a letter urging them to hold a second meeting, but no concrete reply has been received. However, in order to maintain China's sovereignty, the Ministry has decided that at a minimum, it will not give up the right to land, the right to send and receive, and the patent right. Johnson asked whether the Chinese government must repay the telecommunications debt before discussing other issues, as stated by the Daibei and Daitong companies. Wang replied that the Ministry had already made preparations for this. The prepaid telegraph fees owed by China are approximately 300,000 pounds, equivalent to 4 million Chinese national currency. In order to prepare for the repayment of this debt, the Ministry has issued a public bond of 10 million, mortgaging the annual income of the international radio station and the submarine cable fees to be shared by China, with 40% of it being used for this purpose and is currently in progress. Johnson asked whether the Chinese government will negotiate with the Japanese government to abolish the Shanghai Nagasaki submarine cable contract. Wang replied that this contract is of the same nature as the Daibei and Daitong contracts. Since the Ministry does not allow the Daibei and Daitong unequal contract to exist, the Shanghai Nagasaki submarine cable contract should also be abolished. The Ministry has requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to notify the Japanese ambassador to transfer the request to the Ministry of Communications of Japan to send representatives to negotiate new methods. Johnson plans to stay in Nanjing for a few days and then go to Shanghai and then to Beijing. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>British Political Parties' Committee Drafts</h3>
<h3>Report on India Investigation</h3>
<p>Emphasis on Indian National Movement Dissatisfaction with Differential Treatment Reuters, London, 9th: The Indian Constitutional Investigation Committee, jointly formed by various British political parties, with Sir Simon as chairman, visited India twice to investigate various situations, lasting two and a half years and traveling 21,000 miles. Its report has been drafted and is being printed, divided into two volumes. The first volume has now been released and is very interesting, while the second volume is crucial because it contains the committee's various recommendations and proposals. The seven committee members, representing various parties, are in complete agreement on fundamental issues, so this report is a document of great historical significance. The report acknowledges that all educated Indians express a desire for equality with Europeans and are extremely dissatisfied with differential treatment. The report states that it would be a major mistake to ignore the Indian national movement. The committee members believe that the system of senior administrative officials being half accountable to the provincial assembly and half accountable to the civil affairs chief executive cannot be implemented. The important issues discussed by the committee include: (1) future military arrangements, (2) the use of British troops to suppress conflicts between Indian ethnic groups, (3) the issue of martial races, (4) the replacement of the army with Indians, (5) the relationship between the Indian kingdom and the supreme leader, (6) obstacles caused by conflicts between Hindus and Muslims, (7) the issue of representation for majority and minority ethnic groups, (8) the complexity of Indian class issues. The first volume, with 400 pages, has a chapter dedicated to the status of Indian women, discussing the movement against early marriage, the trend against gender segregation, and women's gradual participation in communal affairs. The committee seems to be quite moved by the arguments for Myanmar's secession from India.</p>

Therefore, the hardline leader Sue Matsu, the vice minister, was punished first, followed by the issue of the retirement of Kato, the Chief of the Naval General Staff. It is expected that the Chief of the Naval General Staff will submit a memorandum on the right of supreme command and then submit his resignation. Minister of the Navy Zaibu is looking for a successor, with Admiral Taniguchi, commander of the Kure Naval Base, being the most likely candidate. In addition, both Yamanashi and Sue Matsu, due to the issue of naval reduction, only retired to the reserve and will definitely be reinstated in the naval base or fleet during the regular transfer in December. The House of Peers was quite surprised by Minister of the Navy Zaibu's determination, and Kato, the Chief of the Naval General Staff, whose one hand was cut off (the resignation of Vice Minister of Military Affairs Sue Matsu), can hardly remain silent. Therefore, the resignation of the Chief of the Naval General Staff is only a matter of time. However, with the Naval General Staff undergoing a major change, whether Minister of the Navy Zaibu can remain in his current position is a matter of great attention in the House of Peers. Reuters, Tokyo, 10th: The transfer of senior naval officials, which was expected yesterday, has been announced today. It is rumored that Navy Chief of Staff Kato will soon be replaced by someone closer to the cabinet's views. However, this statement has not been verified by the political circles. It is heard that the cabinet, especially Minister of the Navy Zaibu, is eager to make this change in order to reduce Kato's power to oppose the ratification of the London Naval Treaty.

<h3>Opposition to Implementing the Budget</h3>
<p>Minister of the Army Expresses a Strong Attitude First Meeting of the Administrative Committee Electric Communications Agency, Tokyo, 10th: The Army has repeatedly discussed the government's large reduction of the fiscal 1930 budget since yesterday. As a result of Minister of the Army Uehara summoning Vice Minister Abe to his sickbed for renegotiation, the following strong opposition was conveyed: First, the government is using the reason of falling prices to greatly reduce the Army's clothing and food expenses. However, there is no more room for frugality in the soldiers' clothing and food. If it is necessary to forcibly economize on the soldiers' clothing and food expenses, which are intended to be of the highest quality according to the duty of soldiers, then a proposal to reduce the salaries of officials, which was advocated last year, should be enacted first, and the weak who have no voice should be placed in the back. Second, although the reduced amount is said not to involve personnel expenses, the object expenses related to the Army include absolutely inseparable personnel expenses. As a result, personnel will inevitably be reorganized. Third, the Army is currently studying military system reforms. If the decided budget is repeatedly reduced, the reform plan cannot be established. Fourth, if the weapon expenses and continuation expenses are reduced according to the implementation budget plan, war plans cannot be established. For these four reasons, we absolutely oppose the reduction plan. Electric Communications Agency, Tokyo, 10th: The Army absolutely opposes the implementation budget. Other provinces also strongly oppose it. The Ministry of Interior opposes the reduction of land and wood costs, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry opposes the reduction of forest costs, both of which have indicated that they cannot agree. If the cuts are made, they will inevitably reduce the efficiency of affairs and increase unemployment, so they strongly demand restoration. Electric Communications Agency, Tokyo, 10th: The Administrative Reform Committee, newly established to study countermeasures in preparation for compiling the fiscal 1931 budget, held its first meeting yesterday afternoon at the Minister of Finance's residence. First, Chairman Inoue explained the basic plan drafted by the Accounting Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. As a result, the following investigation items were determined: 1. Unification of purchasing and distribution methods for government office supplies; 2. Simplification of administrative affairs; 3. Unification of construction affairs; 4. Rationalization of government industries, etc. All must be limited to the scope that can be implemented. It was also decided to hold meetings twice a week in the future to discuss the investigation direction. The Ministry of Finance will then, based on the resolutions of this committee, greatly reduce continuation costs and fundamentally revise the plans drafted based on the prices of several years ago, and quickly investigate all non-urgent projects in order to make major cuts.</p>

<h3>Future of US Tariff Bill Uncertain</h3>
<p>National Press, Washington, 9th: The two-house joint committee today completed its discussion with Tenenbaum on the watch tax rate. As a result, the final reconciliation method was established and announced that the bill was ready and would be sent to both houses of Congress for a final vote today. However, the attitude of both houses and President Hoover towards the passage of this bill is quite doubtful. Although the joint committee is composed of members separately appointed by both houses, it is still uncertain whether the bill decided by the committee can be passed by both houses themselves. Even if it is passed, President Hoover's veto is still very likely. Judging from the current atmosphere in various quarters, it would not be surprising if this long-pending tariff bill ultimately fails to succeed. Although President Hoover's intentions are still intriguing, the statement issued by the White House last week certainly contained an expression of vetoing the bill. The bill contains 1,250 items. According to Hoover's intention, the export subsidy clause for farmers in the annexed bill should be deleted, while the clause granting the president the power to increase or decrease tax rates, although opposed by the entire House of Representatives, should be preserved. Vice President Curtis once returned the bill for reconsideration on the pretext of the agenda.</p>

<h3>National Government Approves Allocation of Funds for the Huai River Guidance Commission</h3>
<p>The National Government yesterday instructed the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds for the Huai River Guidance Commission. The Huai River Guidance Commission reported that its annual expenditures and those of the Huaiyin Office were 580,608 yuan; the survey team, hydrological station, and engineering personnel training class expenditures were 347,465 yuan; and the funds for preparing for the implementation of the project were 3,534,920 yuan. The budget had been prepared and submitted to the government for review on October 8 of last year. Later, on February 3 of this year, the Palace Office notified that the Ministry of Finance had replied that the Commission's own expenses would be fixed at 30,000 yuan per month and temporarily listed within the scope of central government expenses, as reviewed and decided by the Finance Committee. In the future, all Huai River funds should be prepared by the Commission to form a detailed fund-raising plan and submitted to the government for approval before proceeding. It is observed that the Commission's project funds are enormous and difficult to raise. Even this monthly expenditure of 30,000 yuan, although approved by the Ministry of Finance, cannot be allocated from the treasury due to a shortage of funds and is being maintained by the Commission borrowing and advancing funds with great effort. However, the survey team, hydrological station, and training class run by the Engineering Office have been actively implemented since their establishment. Furthermore, the German engineering consultant Fanger, having signed a contract, came to China in November of last year and has been paid his salary and expenses on time, maintaining foreign credit. This undertaking is nearing completion, and these expenses should be reported truthfully. Before the Huai River special funds are determined, it is proposed to move funds from the economical line items of the Commission's monthly recurring expenses to provide for this, and a separate report will be created and submitted for verification. It is reasonable to prepare a document and submit it to the government for review and instruction. In addition to instructing that the report is acknowledged and approved, the Ministry of Finance is also informed. This order is issued and should be followed by the Ministry for notification.</p>

<h3>Recent Financial Situation in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Telegram. Since the end of the Guangxi war and the return of the Eighth Route Army, the Guangdong provincial finance has been able to save more than 1.5 million yuan in temporary military expenses each month. If the military force is not expanded in the future, the financial situation may be slightly better than before. However, immediately after the Eighth Route Army returned to Guangdong, there was another expedition to pursue the troops. Although the troops entering Hunan only consisted of Jiang and Cai's two divisions, the expedition made it impossible to predict the itinerary into Hunan and Jiangxi, and the journey was long, so the expedition expenses had to be carefully planned. Therefore, on the day the two divisions set out, the Finance Department raised 2 million yuan for expedition expenses. It is said that this 2 million yuan is only a one-time payment. In the future, if the two divisions advance further, the military expenses may no longer be borne by Guangdong Province, which is not yet known. If this is the case, a sum of military pay can be saved each month, and the financial burden will be relatively reduced. However, while raising funds for the expedition, the General Chamber of Commerce was strictly ordered to sell the remaining military bonds it had undertaken to sell within a limited time. It was found that the Chamber of Commerce had undertaken to sell a total of about 1.4 million yuan in bonds, and only more than 800,000 yuan had been sold as of recently, leaving 600,000 yuan. Therefore, the government ordered the Chamber of Commerce to sell the remaining amount as soon as possible to end the matter. Before Jiang and Cai's two divisions set out for southern Hunan, the Chamber of Commerce was ordered to advance some funds for support. After repeated consultations between the Chamber of Commerce and the Finance Department, the Chamber of Commerce first advanced 100,000 yuan and then another 100,000 yuan two weeks later, which was paid in full at the end of May. Since the Chamber of Commerce had already advanced 200,000 yuan, it was even more eager to promote the sale of bonds. Therefore, starting from the 2nd of this month, it continued to carry bonds to various merchants to solicit sales. As for the 4 million yuan in military bonds issued by the Finance Department to raise funds for cash redemption by the Bank of China and to supply military expenses, it was found that a total of 2,550,495 yuan was sold in the first phase, including 7,945 bonds with a face value of 100 yuan, totaling 794,500 yuan; 10,613 bonds with a face value of 50 yuan, totaling 530,650 yuan; 81,788 bonds with a face value of 10 yuan, totaling 817,880 yuan; and 81,493 bonds with a face value of 5 yuan, totaling 407,465 yuan. The above is the amount issued in the first phase. The period for principal and interest repayment will arrive in June of this year (i.e., this month). The Finance Department has now stipulated that drawings will be held in installments, with the first month being June 16, the second month being July 16, the third month being August 16, the fourth month being September 16, and the fifth month being October 16. For winning numbers, the principal and interest can be collected at the Central Bank within eight months after the drawing date upon presentation of the bond (June 3rd). Local Telegram.</p>

<p>Severe Wind, Thunder and Hail Damage Crops. Yesterday afternoon at about 3 o'clock, a severe wind suddenly rose accompanied by thunder and hail. Suddenly, sand and stones flew, and everything was swept away. All the bamboo fences in the countryside were blown down, and many houses in the town were also shaken. Such intensity has not been seen in decades. Flowers and crops in the northeast area were especially withered. Fortunately, it subsided after more than twenty minutes, but the estimated losses are still significant.</p>

<p>Large Numbers of Refugees Arrive. A large number of refugees, five or six hundred people, have arrived in the western townships of this county in the past day or two. Each has been helped by others, mostly from Hunan Province. Those who have a complete set of daily necessities and clothes are especially numerous. Therefore, whenever they arrive in a town, they completely search for chicken, meat, fish, and shrimp. Before the temples where they stay, they burn incense and offer candles every day at dawn, and their actions are very strange. Currently, the public security bureaus have joined forces with the district office to raise funds to provide assistance and expel them. The Case of Imprisonment of Father's Concubine Resolved. Li Tianmin of Nanqiao previously reported that Zhuang Jieqing, manager of the Lixiang Electric Light Factory, had imprisoned his father's concubine. Since the two parties' lawsuit was accepted by the county judiciary and a hearing was scheduled, Li submitted supplementary reasons, stating that the circumstances of the imprisonment were indeed witnessed by his four neighbors, Miss E and others, and that his concubine had cried for help while imprisoned, asking them to notify her family to come to her aid. However, after he reported to the district office, it took three days for the public security bureau to search, and Zhuang had already destroyed the evidence after learning of the news. Fortunately, Song San, the craftsman who made the wooden prison, and eighteen small round logs purchased from the Nanmu Trading Company can still be used as evidence. There are also traces of horses and spiders that can be found at the site of the imprisonment. At the same time, Zhuang not only filed another lawsuit against Li for spreading rumors but also had his concubine participate in declaring that there had been no imprisonment or abuse in Zhuang's house. Later, relatives such as Zhuang Rangquan, Xu Jinshan, and Chen Jiyu, seeing that the two parties were going to extremes, came out to mediate the matter the day before yesterday, and Lin Yuan also provided written guarantees to persuade Zhuang Jieqing to drop the case.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Villagers Catch Strange Fish. Yesterday, the Bureau of Education received a strange fish from Nonggang, Putan Township, seeking to sell it. The fish is about ten feet long and weighs about fifty pounds. It resembles a whale in the ocean. The head has a small hole for spraying water. The skin is black and shiny like lacquer. The eyes are small, and the abdomen is milky white. However, it is already dead. According to the villagers, it was stranded in Putan. When it was found, it had a slight breath and died soon after. The bureau bought it for two yuan and handed it over to the Public Education Hall for taxidermy and display. According to research, it is produced in the Atlantic Ocean and belongs to the whale class, not a fish but a beast called the sand shark. It probably entered the water with the tide and has a strange and fishy smell. A lead bucket of oil was obtained from its abdomen, and the four fins are very large. In recent days, visitors have been crowding to see it. Order to Investigate the Families of Martyrs. The Families of Martyrs of the May 30th Massacre reported that Xu Luofeng, a martyr from Songjiang, had previously moved his family to 76 Meilin Lane, Meiwei Road, Zhabei, Shanghai, and was martyred in the May 30th Massacre. Now, it is proposed to issue a pension. After investigation, it was found that they had moved two years ago, and their whereabouts were unknown. Therefore, a letter was sent to the county government to request assistance in finding them. If the family of the martyr Xu is found, they should be notified to submit the martyr's certificate to the association for registration and verification so that they can be guaranteed to receive the pension, etc. The county government immediately ordered the district offices under its jurisdiction to investigate. The Ninth District Reviews Public Funds and Property. The Ninth District (Xiaokunshan) Office of this county was ordered to organize a committee to review public funds and property. Recently, the committee reviewed the account of the former Administrative Bureau Director and found two items: 100 yuan for the Tingwu Wharf Pavilion project and 120 yuan for the Jiangcaobang stone bridge repair project. The respective township chiefs reported that there was no construction, and the meeting sent staff to inspect and confirm that it was true. The case concerns public funds, and it was submitted to the county for verification. It is now heard that the former director has hired a craftsman to start construction. However, the district took photographs to confirm it and preserve the truth.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Silk Weaving Industry Requests Tax Reduction. The raw materials for Suzhou's silk weaving industry have always relied on silk production in various villages. This year, due to poor cocoon production, the harvest has been greatly reduced, and the number of cocoon companies in various villages has increased sharply, resulting in a significant reduction in silk production. As a result, raw materials are in short supply. In addition, heavy taxes make it impossible to develop businesses. The industry has already telegraphed the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to request exemption from export customs duties. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has consulted the Ministry of Finance for review. The industry has also jointly elected Cheng Ganxiang as a representative to go to Beijing on the 10th to petition the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting a reduction in tax rates. Police and Bandits Exchange Fire in Zhuangqian Village. Gu, the village chief of Zhuangqian Village, Longdun Mountain, received a letter from bandits on the morning of the 9th, demanding 8,000 yuan and setting a deadline for payment on the afternoon of the same day. While Village Chief Gu was hesitating after receiving the letter, three bandit boats arrived at 2 p.m., with about thirty bandits each, armed with guns and surrounding the village. Fortunately, a villager took the opportunity to escape and reported to the county police team stationed in Xietang. Zhao, the team leader, immediately led the team to suppress the bandits and opened fire. The bandits also returned fire. The two sides exchanged fire for three hours before the bandits retreated towards Wusong Port. Kidnapping Cases Occur Frequently in Jiaozhi Township. On the 9th, more than twenty bandits arrived in Xixu Village, Jiaozhi Township, and kidnapped Gu Ashui and two others. The county government has set a five-day deadline to solve the case, which was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that eight more bandit boats arrived in the village at 10 a.m., with about eighty bandits each, speaking in the Pudong dialect and armed with guns. They kidnapped a farmer surnamed Fei, his daughter-in-law, and fled towards Yangcheng Lake. Planned Price Stabilization for the City and Countryside to be Held Regularly.

Each household is limited to buying two liters of rice per three-day period, and rice tickets are divided into red and blue colors.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Office Orders the Sealing of the Yongxing Preparatory Office. The Changzhou Zhenhua and Wuxi Yaoming power plants were ordered by the ministry in the 16th year of the Republic of China to merge and form the Yongxing Company, which had a preparatory office. Subsequently, in the 17th year, the Central Construction Commission took over the national-run Yongxing Preparatory Office, and the preparatory office was also abolished. Recently, in order to develop the business of the capital and Qishuyan power plants and to organize the debts of the Qi plant, the Construction Commission requested and obtained approval from the National Government to issue long-term public bonds of 1.5 million yuan as a special amount to organize the debts of the Qi plant, to be repaid in principal and interest within 15 years. Short-term public bonds of 2.5 million yuan are to be used to develop the business of the two plants and are to be repaid in principal and interest within seven years. A fund management committee was organized in Shanghai, and an office was established at 15 Bowuyuan Road to start recruiting. However, before long, the Yongxing Electric Company Preparatory Office suddenly published advertisements in the Shen and Xin newspapers opposing the use of the business income of the Qishuyan power plant reorganized from Zhenhua to guarantee the principal and interest of the above bonds, and that the Construction Commission's acquisition of the Zhen and Yao plants caused the two companies to fail to merge and reorganize into the Yongxing Electric Company, hindering the rights of Yongxing's stakeholders. The Construction Commission, after reading the newspaper, believed that it was intentionally hindering credit and attempting to undermine it, and requested the provincial government to order the civil affairs and construction departments to order the Wuxi County government to seal up the Yongxing Company Preparatory Office and severely punish the responsible personnel. Upon receiving the order, County Chief Sun directly ordered the Construction Bureau to investigate the matter. The Construction Bureau stated that there was no Yongxing Company in the county and has reported back to the county government to be forwarded to the provincial departments. Organize a Wounded Soldiers Reception Center. County Chief Sun, in order to be prudent and thorough in the matter of this county being ordered to receive wounded soldiers, intends to organize a wounded soldiers reception center and has appointed Sun Zuji and Chen Zhanru as the director and deputy director, respectively, Qian Tianxiong as the director of the general affairs group, Gu Yonggen and Lu Hongsheng as the deputy directors, Wang Haitao as the director of the medical group, Ye Bingheng and Shi Yilin as the deputy directors, and Huang Zhenbai and Zhu Zhengui as the director and deputy director of the guard group. In addition, the county's administrative program for this year was also submitted for discussion at this meeting. It was decided to appoint Xu Yisong, Hua Shaochun, and Lu Qi to jointly review it.

Wang Jun, a well-known Communist in this county, is from Zhang Village in the Fifth District of the Northern Township. He has committed murder and arson in the Northern Township and has been wanted by the authorities for 2,000 yuan, but has not been captured. Recently, his younger sister, Wang Yasheng, suffered from tuberculosis in a hospital in Shanghai. Her brother-in-law, Ji, accompanied the coffin to Wuxi for burial. The matter has been completed. Yesterday (the 10th) morning at 9:00 a.m., Ji came to the city from the township to prepare to return to Shanghai. Wang Jun also arrived in the township the day before. Wu Zhengrong, chief of the political police of the county government, learned of this and immediately went to the township to arrest him. Yesterday morning, Wang Jun was sending Ji to the vicinity of the Guandi Temple in the district when he happened to meet Chief Wu, who immediately arrested him. The bandit dared to resist arrest and was shot in the head by the police. A loaded pistol was found next to Wang. He was immediately escorted to the city and presented to the county government at 4:30 p.m. for questioning.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Five Families Robbed Near Xiaoxinqiao. Cheng Zhixin, a patrol officer from the Fifth Police Station of the Longhutang First Branch Bureau in Wuyi, reported to the Public Security Bureau on the 9th that two or thirty bandits suddenly came to Yangxi Village near Xiaoxinqiao under his jurisdiction the day before yesterday. They were wearing red and white cloths on their heads, each carrying rifles and flashlights, and speaking in the local accent. They robbed five families in order: Wan Jinhai, Jiang Haoyun, Jiang Haoqing, Liu PanGen, Jiang Genhai, etc. Jiang Haoyun's face and Liu PanGen's foot were shot. By the time the assembled patrol officers and armed guards arrived, the bandits had fled towards Laoguqiao. Gentry Plan Scenic Area. Feng Xiaoqing, Zhuang Sihan, Shen Bao, and other gentry in Wuyi, believing that there are neither scenic mountains and rivers nor elegant gardens in the vicinity of the city, and that residents have little vitality and visitors have no place to rest, initiated a plan to establish a scenic area. The area outside the East Gate, including Tianning Temple, Xuanmiao Temple, Wenbi Pagoda, and Yizhou Pavilion, was selected as the scope. The Construction Bureau has drawn up a regional map, and a meeting will be held at the County Chamber of Commerce today (the 11th) to discuss implementation measures.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Find Ways to Relieve Local Finances. For the past three years, the Zhenjiang County local budget has often not been established, often due to insufficient funds for local undertakings, resulting in misappropriation and suspension. This year, local revenue will be reduced with the autumn harvest (the autumn harvest is only slightly more than 50%, and local revenue is halved), but all uses are fixed amounts, which are difficult to cut short. Yesterday, County Chief Zhang Peng convened a meeting of various bureaus, offices, and local legal entities to discuss the local budget for the 19th year. After repeated deliberations, there was no good plan. It was decided to appoint County Chief Zhang, Chen Sibai, a member of the county party standing committee, and Han Wenqing, director of the Education Bureau, to jointly submit a report to the provincial government, Civil Affairs Department, and Finance Department, requesting relief measures. Bandits Rampant in Gaozi Township. On the day before yesterday (the 8th) at about 8:00 p.m., 300 bandits were suddenly discovered on Shuchang Street in Gaozi Township. At that time, the people of the township were in panic, and the local defense forces were unable to do anything. Subsequently, the garrison troops stationed in the township sent urgent telegrams for help. The 11th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the Provincial Guard Brigade was dispatched by Zhenjiang special train to suppress them. In addition, Chen Fu, director of the Provincial Public Security Bureau, believed that the bandits dared to act rampantly near the provincial capital, which was a complete disregard for the law. Yesterday, he specially dispatched the Second and Third Security Squads to suppress them, led by Inspector Xu Yuyin and Battalion Commander Wang Yupai. It is expected that they will be able to wipe them out in one fell swoop. Court Executes Bandit by Shooting. The bandit Wang Desheng, from Henan, 34 years old, was once a platoon leader. Last year, he robbed the Changban small steamer with accomplices. After being arrested by the local court, he was sentenced to death according to the law after several trials. After the court submitted it to the High Court for approval and the provincial government for approval, the prisoner was taken to the new execution ground outside the North Gate at about 12:00 on the 9th to verify his identity and execute him by shooting.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>The Western Township of Huangtu is Disturbed by Bandits. The Licheng and Taohua townships in the west of the county and the Xunli and Yidong townships in Wujin are close to each other. In recent days, bandits such as Gao Xiaosheng have gathered followers and become rampant. The night before last (the 8th), they robbed shops in Huangtu, Licheng, killing one person and injuring several others. The area belongs to Jiangyin, located in a remote area in the west, more than 50 miles away from the city, and there is no telephone. The Sixth District Office sent someone to report the incident to the county government by foot. On the 9th, police were sent to the township to suppress the bandits at an opportune moment. Minutes of the County Government Meeting. Many important cases were resolved at the county government meeting on the 9th: (1) The Construction Bureau should be responsible for completing the bridge and other projects in the northern section of the Yifeng-Wuxi Highway by the end of October of this year and opening it to traffic in November; (2) Jiangyin is a national defense fortress, and it is proposed to connect the national long-distance telephone from Qifang, Wuxi, to Qingyang, Jiangyin, in order to disseminate news. The Construction Bureau should prepare a cost estimate and submit it to the county government to be submitted to the Construction Department for approval; (3) Recently, there have been many rumors, and in addition to the county government and the fortress commander issuing announcements to dispel the rumors, the Public Security Bureau should strictly arrest those who create rumors and cause trouble and prohibit the lighting of firecrackers; (4) Intensify the inspection of postal and telecommunications work; (5) The bandit leader Lu Danglin has been repeatedly wanted, but has not been captured, and a reward of 500 yuan is offered for his arrest. The Kidnapped Hostage Was Redeemed and Returned Home. Xiang Zhixian, the owner of Xiangji in Wangjiatai, the Second District, was kidnapped by bandits on the 26th of last month. He repeatedly received letters from the bandits demanding a ransom, which was reduced from 4,600 yuan to 3,500 yuan. The redeemed hostage returned home the night before last. It is said that he was treated quite well in the bandit den, but he did not know where it was. He heard gunshots every night in the den. When he was released, he was first placed on a boat for half an hour and then carried to the southern foot of Phoenix Mountain in a sedan chair and walked home. A Performance Almost Caused Trouble. In the name of the Guandi Birthday Festival on the old calendar, the people of Lujiaqiao, Zhutang, invited a Jianghu opera troupe to perform for three days to collect debts from merchants. Zhang Yiquan, the district chief of the 13th district, learned of this and went to stop it without success. Gunshots were also found in the opera arena. Fearing that reactionary elements would take the opportunity to make trouble, District Chief Zhang reported to County Chief Li yesterday afternoon and requested the Public Security Bureau to arrest the ringleaders, Wang Ruquan and others, and bring them to the county for trial.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Xu Shiying Arrives in Tong from Beijing. Xu Shiying, chairman of the National Government Relief Committee, arrived in Tong from Beijing on the Jiang'an steamer.

Bandits Rampant in Li Guanyintan, East of the City. At 2:00 a.m. on the 9th, about fifty or sixty bandits suddenly arrived in Li Guanyintan, east of the city, carrying guns, flashlights, and firing shots to demonstrate their power. They also distributed reactionary leaflets, robbing merchants such as Town Chief Sha Yiyu and then setting fire to houses. They then went to Hexi to search and rob until 4:00 a.m. before retreating with the stolen goods. The county police team rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, but the bandits had already fled far away. Raise Local Short-Term Loans of 50,000 Yuan. The Nantong County Public Funds and Property Management Office proposed to raise local short-term loans of 50,000 yuan to remedy the huge deficit caused by the fact that local expenditures exceed revenue. The county government meeting passed four measures on the 9th: (1) The Funds and Property Office will issue 500 loan vouchers, each voucher with a face value of 100 yuan, to be repaid in six months; (2) The monthly interest rate is 5%, and 97 yuan will be actually received for every 100 yuan when collecting the loan; (3) The voucher surface states that it is used for local affairs in the county; (4) The county government will report to the provincial departments for record. The Owner of a Car Company Dies Tragically. Jiang Chuntang, the owner of the Lu Shun Car Company, was tragically beaten to death by thugs because the county police team hired a car. The criminals, Liang Qinghai and others, have been tried by the county court according to law. Team Leader Jin has promised to pay 1,000 yuan to the deceased's family and has already paid 200 yuan. The car industry is currently asking Jin to allocate the full amount and has scheduled a meeting at the Nantong Theater on the 17th to hold a memorial service.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Salted Duck Egg Boats Robbed in Li Port: Yu Tai Xing, a salted duck egg boat from Yao North, recently sailed to Zhenhai Li Port to purchase goods. Unexpectedly, when the boat reached the waters outside Zhenhai near Li Port, a pirate ship suddenly appeared. The pirates, numbering about ten, brandishing wooden-cased guns, swarmed aboard. Seeing it was an empty boat, they demanded that Yu Wanxing, the boat's accountant, point out the owner. Yu identified himself, and they ordered the boat to be sailed to a bandit den on the beach. They looted all the small items and took the boat and its crew, ordering Yu Wanxing to return to Yao and report to the owner to prepare foreign currency for ransom.</p>
<p>Wang Hengfeng's House Repeatedly Robbed: Wang Hengfeng, a resident of Qiuwang Village in the Dongxu District of Zhenbei, and his wife run a small "Qian Yuan" shop along the Longshe River in the village, barely making a living. Unexpectedly, on the 23rd of last month, at 11 PM, three or four robbers wielding flashlights broke into their house. Using vices and small knives as weapons, they threatened the victims and ransacked the house, stealing clothes, silver dollars, and copper coins before escaping. Afterwards, Mr. Wang, considering the losses were minimal, resigned himself to bad luck. However, only half a month later, around 12:00 AM on the 6th of this month, five or six robbers broke down the shop door again. Four entered while the others stood guard outside, injuring the victims on their bodies and limbs with awls in multiple places. They demanded the victims hand over cash and jewelry, but got nothing. They then broke open chests and boxes, searching thoroughly for about half an hour before fleeing towards the rear of the village, crossing Buyizhen Ridge towards the east gate. After inspection, the losses included sixty to seventy dollars worth of goods, countless clothing items and soft goods.</p>
<p>Youth Commits Suicide by Jumping into the Sea: On the afternoon of the 7th, on the Xinjiangtian steamer sailing from Shanghai to Ningbo, a passenger, about twenty years old, of unknown name, speaking in a regional accent and dressed in luxurious clothing, appearing to be from the upper class, boarded the ship and occupied a high berth in the second class cabin. After the ship set sail, the passenger took out magazines and newspapers and read them on the bed. However, he soon threw the books and newspapers aside, as if burdened by a heavy heart. He paced around the ship several times, and around 11 PM, when the ship was approaching the Daxie waters, the passenger took advantage of the moment when no one was paying attention and jumped into the sea. By the time the crew heard the news, it was too late to retrieve him.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Sock Industry Appeals for Exemption from Yarn Tax: Previously, the yarn and thread tax in the six counties of Jiaxing was contracted out to merchants. Due to underestimated tax amounts, those in charge profited greatly, leading to internal conflicts and a scramble for the tax rights. Subsequently, the Finance Department dispatched officials to investigate and verify that if the tax were reorganized and collected realistically, the annual revenue could exceed 100,000 silver dollars, significantly benefiting national taxation. Therefore, the contract system for the yarn and thread tax was abolished and replaced with direct collection by the Unified Tax Bureau. Recently, the Finance Department further revised the tax rate, adopting a method of taxing 7.25% of the value. Each bale of foreign yarn is taxed at ten plus dollars, and each bale of mercerized yarn is taxed at forty plus dollars, a difference of more than ten times compared to the old average tax of three dollars and sixty cents per bale. The sock and yarn thread industries in the six counties, unable to bear this tax rate, have organized a petition committee and joined forces with yarn merchants from Hai Ning, Xia Shi, and other places to appeal to the provincial government to base the tax rate on the current rate in Jiangsu Province, aiming to alleviate commercial distress. They have also suspended imports until their petition is granted to show resistance. It remains to be seen how the provincial government will resolve this issue.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Telegram Requesting the Release of Erroneously Detained Domestic Goods: The Zhejiang Finance Department stated that according to a telegram from the Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation, the tax-exempt goods of the Feng Dyeing and Weaving Factory being transported to Zhejiang were detained by the Zhejiang Cloth Unified Tax Bureau. They were asked to promptly order the bureau chief, Hu Zutong, to investigate and comply.</p>
<p>Secret Capture of Bandit Leaders and Accomplices: A prisoner being escorted from the Hangzhou District Court to Yuyao, who had been transferred from the Shaoxing Local Branch Court, was ambushed by several robbers wielding firearms in Gaobu. They forcibly took the prisoner halfway and shot and killed a police officer on the spot. The authorities consider this to be a serious matter and have ordered various county bureaus and regimental camps to secretly capture the bandit leaders and accomplices, investigate them thoroughly, and prepare to execute them by firing squad as a warning to others.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Conflict Between Water Police and Merchants: Wei Ahe, a fruit vendor in Qianqing Town, eastern Xiaoshan, was dumping garbage into the river on the 2nd when a water police officer noticed him and stepped forward to dissuade him. Wei refused to listen and spoke rudely. The water police then took Wei to the team for questioning. Subsequently, the village chief of Beian Village, Jiang Bohan, interceded and secured his release. Unexpectedly, after being released, Wei led many merchants and the village chief of Nanan Village, Gao Rudu, and others directly into the team's office to question the squad leader. The squad leader immediately rang the bell, smashed equipment, and injured patrol officers. Seeing this, the team leader ordered an arrest. Mo Borong, Li Dajun, Zhao Linchang, Chen Lianqing, Shen Qingbao, and eleven others were apprehended and sent to the city headquarters for interrogation. It is also rumored that all shops in the town have gone on strike since the 7th to show resistance.</p>
<p>Traffic Accident on the Xiaoshao Highway: On the afternoon of the 7th, at 3:00 PM, a small passenger car No. 108 traveling from Zhuanba to Jiangbian, carrying four passengers, suddenly collided with a car coming from the east near the Xixing Bridge due to failure to yield. Two passengers, Xia Yiquan and Shen Chuanjun, were seriously injured, and two others, Liu Afu and others, sustained minor injuries. They have been sent to Jimin Hospital for treatment. However, Xia Yiquan's injuries are severe, and his life may be in danger. The driver, Wei Yi, and Qi Changgen have been taken into custody by the Xixing Public Security Branch.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Undutiful Son Sentenced to Eight Months: Ge Jinshan, the younger son of Ge Wang, the female owner of the Dongyuan Bathhouse on Xiaojie Street in this city, is just a young man, but he is inherently stubborn and often beats his mother and sister-in-law. The other day, because he failed to extort money, he assaulted them again. His mother sued the Public Security Bureau to arrest Jinshan and take him to court for temporary detention. Yesterday, Ge Wang was summoned to court, and after confirming the facts, he was found guilty of disobedience and sentenced to eight months in prison, to be served in jail.</p>

<h3>Vice Minister of Education and Others Take Oath of Office</h3>
<p>Zhu Jingnong, the Permanent Vice Minister of Education (promoted from Director, has been in office for three months), Jiang Shaomo, the Director of the General Affairs Department (promoted from Counselor, has been in office for three months), Sun Benwen, the Director of the Higher Education Department (has been in office for one month), Zheng Tianting, the Secretary (has been in office for three months), and Chen Shizhen, the Counselor (has been in office for a long time), all took the oath of office at the Ministry of Education on the 9th, having been in their respective positions for a while. The ceremony was held after the Ministry's weekly memorial service at 8 AM that morning. Tao Gongheng, a Secretary from the Executive Yuan, was dispatched to oversee the oath-taking ceremony. Recently, the central government has placed great emphasis on oath-taking (previously, only those in positions appointed by the president took the oath, but now all those in appointed positions above the commissioned rank must take the oath upon taking office). The Vice Minister, Directors, Secretary, Counselors, and others all signed and sealed their oaths. Tao Gongheng first delivered a training speech on behalf of the Executive Yuan, stating that during the era of the University Council, they did more with less, using people sparingly and managing state funds economically, which was admirable. Although the Ministry has changed to the Ministry of Education, it is still the same policy, which is commendable. He hoped this spirit would be maintained permanently and that those above would influence those below. Zhu Jingnong then delivered a reply on behalf of the Ministry, stating that they were very grateful for the encouragement from the Executive Yuan's representative and that they would work hard under the guidance of the Minister of Education to gradually realize the various plans established by the University Council and the Ministry of Education. However, he humbly acknowledged their limited abilities and hoped for guidance from superiors and corrections from all sides.</p>
<p>Executive Yuan Order to Subsidize</p>
<h3>Expenses for the Beiping Xiangshan Orphanage</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously received an order from the Executive Yuan to dispatch Section Chief Dai Yingguan to Beiping in mid-March to inspect the Xiangshan Orphanage. According to Dai's report, the orphanage encompasses six schools, progressing from the infant care center to the kindergarten, elementary school, middle school, and providing assistance for entrance into university, completing the entire educational stage. Horizontally, it combines general education with vocational education, and schools and factories operate together. The primary school provides vocational cultivation, the junior high school provides vocational exploration, and the organization is tight-knit with few staff members, yet all tasks are well-managed. The 1,670 students are all engaged in their respective activities and enjoy themselves. Education emphasizes guidance, yet school discipline is strict and the school spirit is lively and practical, without any of the superficiality of the city. The report also described the orphanage as a place for nurturing disaster-stricken children, incentivizing poor and talented students to advance, emphasizing vocational education, combining education and upbringing, and the students' frugal lifestyle, highlighting five unique features. However, despite saving on food, clothing, and expenses, the monthly cost of care and school supplies for the orphanage's 1,670 students still amounts to 12,725.50 silver dollars, accounting for 44% of the total expenditure of 29,209.40 dollars. The salaries of teachers and staff total 9,385.60 dollars, accounting for 32%. Administrative expenses are 3,373.80 dollars, accounting for 11%. This shows that the salaries of the teachers and staff are low. It is said that the cost per school and grade is 7 to 10 times lower than similar schools in Hebei Province. Of the orphanage's total monthly expenditure, in addition to the above three items, there is also 3,729.50 dollars, accounting for 12%, which is higher than the administrative expenses, and is the interest on loans. Over the years, accumulated losses have reached 407,348 dollars. Therefore, the entire faculty and students are currently struggling and awaiting rescue more urgently than being hung upside down. In addition to the aforementioned interest expense, which should be addressed by finding a way to repay the debt to achieve a fundamental solution, the remaining three expenditure items seem to have already been reduced as much as possible and cannot be further reduced. Based on Section Chief Dai's report and the orphanage director Xiong Bingsan's report of financial difficulties, the Ministry of Education submitted a document to the Executive Yuan stating that the orphanage's performance is indeed excellent and its financial difficulties are real. If only 10,000 yuan is subsidized each month, the most frugal food, clothing, and supplies for the 1,600 students will not be enough to cover expenses, making it impossible to continue. In recent years, domestic disasters have been frequent and there are many refugees. The government is actively raising funds to engage in relief efforts, and the Beiping Xiangshan Orphanage, which specializes in sheltering disaster-stricken children and combining education and upbringing, and has already achieved significant results, should be vigorously maintained. It is proposed that, in addition to the 10,000 yuan already allocated from the Boxer Indemnity Fund, the Executive Yuan should find a way to allocate another 10,000 yuan per month to the orphanage, for a total of 20,000 yuan. The remaining shortfall should be addressed by the Ministry ordering the orphanage to find its own solutions. Before a definite solution is determined for the additional 10,000 yuan, the 10,000 yuan that was previously allocated to the orphanage monthly by the Construction Committee should be continued to be allocated temporarily to maintain operations. The Executive Yuan has now instructed that the proposal be approved as discussed. The Construction Committee has been ordered to continue allocating the 10,000 yuan that was previously allocated to the orphanage monthly until a definite solution is determined for the subsidy. The Ministry of Finance has also been ordered to continue directly allocating this amount as before to maintain operations. The Ministry of Education and the Xiangshan Orphanage are to be informed accordingly.</p>

<p>The Municipal Office believes that education in Bengbu is very underdeveloped. Among the school-age children who have reached the age to start school, nearly two-thirds are not enrolled, mainly because most families are poor and cannot afford to send their children to school. The office has been approved by the Education Department to allocate 500 yuan per month in compulsory education subsidies starting from February of this year. It plans to establish five compulsory elementary schools in each of the five districts, with one director per school instead of a principal, directly under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Office. The second and fifth schools will be established first. The second school will be located in the Construction Association on Guoqing Street in District 2 (Director Zhang Hou'an, a graduate of the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts). The fifth school will be located at the Guanyue Temple at the southern end of Sanjing Street in District 5 (Director not yet determined). Enrollment notices have been posted, and classes will begin soon.</p>

<p>Middle School Basketball Championship</p>
<h3>持志附中 wins</h3>
<p>By a score of 25 to 23, the basketball team of Chih Chih High School defeated Shih Chung.  A total of eight schools participated in the Shanghai Secondary School Athletic Association's basketball championship.  After a month of competition, the right to the final was won by the Futan Shih Chung and Chih Chih High School teams.  The final was held last night at 7:30 PM at the Chinese Basketball Hall on Rue du Pere Robert. The two sides were evenly matched and the game was very intense. The Chih Chih team had excellent teamwork, and the players were lively and fought well. As a result, Chih Chih defeated Futan Shih Chung by a score of 25 to 23 to win the championship. The referee was Lu Zhongen. As soon as the game began, the Chih Chih team bravely attacked, and Qian Dingshen and Dai Yourui frequently scored, suddenly taking a commanding lead of 9 to 0, overwhelming their opponents. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the Shih Chung team roused their spirits and quickly caught up, with Zhang Jinxiang, Zhang Kunxiang, and Cheng Mingjue successively scoring, adding six points. After this setback, the Chih Chih team launched another fierce attack, relying on their lively and agile physiques, dashing all over the court, making it difficult for the opponents to anticipate their moves. The score continued to increase. Although the Shih Chung team tried their best to resist, they were five points behind Chih Chih, who led 15 to 10 at the end of the first half. After switching sides, the Chih Chih team took advantage of their momentum, and their vigor became even more evident. However, the Shih Chung team worked hard to counterattack and spared no effort, but they repeatedly missed good opportunities due to inaccurate shooting. In the blink of an eye, Chih Chih took an eight-point lead, with the score at 20 to 12. After that, the two sides were evenly matched, with alternating advances. After Chih Chih led 23 to 16, the Shih Chung team suddenly rallied, and Zhang Kunxiang made repeated brilliant contributions, bringing the score close to 25 to 23. The Shih Chung team was only two points behind and was still in high spirits, trying to retaliate, but time was running out and the game soon ended. Chih Chih then won with a score of 25 to 23.</p>

<h3>Hui Ling Wins Against Jing Hai 38 to 9</h3>
<p>After a period of promotion, women's sports in Suzhou have shown signs of vigorous development. Initially, it was mainly focused on basketball, then spread to track and field events. Recently, various schools have started baseball training. Hui Ling Girls' High School played a baseball practice match against Jing Hai Girls' High School yesterday at the Jing Hai field. Because both sides had no prior experience, there were few highlights. However, with long-term training, it may not be difficult to compete with the female players in Shanghai.

<h3>Temporary Suspension of the Gold Exchange</h3>
<p>With gold prices soaring and public sentiment in turmoil, the market has become panicked. The Ministries of Industry and Finance have repeatedly planned stopgap measures to alleviate the current emergency, and have decided to order the temporary closure of the Shanghai Gold Exchange to prevent speculative manipulation. The bullion market of the Goods Exchange will also be temporarily suspended. This measure was agreed upon by Ministers Kong and Soong in Shanghai with various parties. After being submitted to the National Government for approval, it can be ordered to be announced in the coming days. Because the Exchange Law already has regulations regarding this maintenance measure, the exchange has also decided to comply with the order and temporarily suspend operations.</p>

However, at present, because the Shanghai market is experiencing fluctuations, it is necessary to temporarily postpone the shipment and observe the situation.</p>
<h3>Settlement of the Labor Dispute at Nanyang Tobacco Factory</h3>
<p>Receiving severance pay starting on the 12th. The case of the Shanghai factory of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company ceasing operations was resolved after repeated consultations between worker representatives and the management. It was agreed that the company would pay each employee two months' wages as retirement pay, supplement two days' wages, and provide each person with five yuan for travel expenses to seek new employment. After the agreement was signed, the company fulfilled the agreement, and the workers received the money accordingly. Subsequently, unemployed workers, due to financial difficulties, once again elected representatives to petition the Shanghai Special Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau for relief. The company also submitted the facts of the agreement reached with the workers after the shutdown and the difficult circumstances to various levels of government agencies, requesting to maintain the situation. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce then approved the Shanghai Special Municipal Government to investigate and handle the matter. The Executive Yuan also approved that the company temporarily closed the factory due to excessive losses and entrusted another factory to manufacture cigarettes to maintain operations. It was temporarily unable to resume operations and was still factual. The Shanghai Municipal Government was ordered to handle the matter in accordance with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's advisory opinion and to revoke Instruction No. 1149 of the Social Affairs Bureau. A few days ago, the unemployed workers went to the Municipal Government to petition again. The Municipal Government persuaded the management to consider the workers' difficulties and, in any case, increase the workers' benefits to quell the dispute. Worker representatives went to the company to petition and negotiated peacefully with company representatives. Both sides have reached an understanding. The company, considering the many years of service of the workers, agreed to add 5,000 yuan for worker severance pay. The 5,000 yuan is based on a standard of 1,000 people. The distribution method is that each worker should receive 5 yuan. If the number of people receiving the money is less than 1,000, the remaining money will be automatically sent to charitable organizations for charitable purposes. If the number of workers exceeds 1,000, the 5,000 yuan will not be enough, and the shortfall will be supplemented by the management, based on the number of people who received retirement pay at the time of the factory closure. Yesterday, representatives of labor and management signed an agreement with the Municipal Government, and the case was concluded. All of the above-mentioned additional money is scheduled to be distributed from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM on June 12th at the Huashang Cigarette Industry Association in Pingle Lane, Jiujiang Road, Xizang Road, and must be distributed within five days.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at the American-Asian Silk Factory</h3>
<p>Proposing four conditions. The labor dispute at the American-Asian Silk Factory in Shanghai has been ongoing for more than a month and has not yet been resolved. It was recently reported that the main factory and the fourth and sixth branch factories unanimously went on strike on the 8th and proposed four conditions: (1) reinstate workers who were dismissed without cause; (2) fulfill the conditions agreed upon by labor and management in 1927; (3) issue savings certificates; (4) revoke temporary employment contracts. They demanded that the management fulfill these conditions immediately. If the management still does not accept them and continues to be extreme, the remaining second, third, fifth, seventh, and eighth branch factories will also go on strike immediately to seek a final resolution, and they requested appropriate assistance from all sectors.</p>
<p>British-American Tobacco Factory in Pudong</p>
<h3>Tobacco Leaf Workers Go on Strike</h3>
<p>The reason is that the factory changed the work arrangements, making it difficult for workers to maintain their livelihoods. A total of 70 to 80 female workers in the tobacco leaf tearing department of the new and old British-American Tobacco Factories in Pudong went on strike yesterday because the factory changed the work arrangements, making it difficult for them to maintain their livelihoods. The details of the dispute are as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for the strike:</p>
<p>The female workers in the tobacco leaf tearing department used to work on tobacco stems one day and tobacco leaves the next day. Their wages were based on the standard for tobacco stems, with a wage of 14 cents per 100 pounds of tobacco stems. On days when they worked on tobacco leaves, the amount of work was not specified, and the wage was based on the wage earned by the workers the day before for working on tobacco stems. Therefore, fast workers could process 400 to 500 pounds per day, and their wages were also higher. Unexpectedly, the Osaka Lai Dike (transliteration), who was newly transferred from the third factory, suddenly changed the rules and wanted to use tobacco leaves as the standard. Workers only earned 13 cents per 100 pounds of tobacco leaves. Moreover, the factory newly imported new leaves from the United States, which were thick and light. Even the fastest workers could only process about 200 pounds per day, and slow workers could only process about 100 pounds per day. The workers worked hard all day, but their wages were only 10 to 20 cents. It was difficult for the workers to maintain their livelihoods, so they reported to the union and requested negotiations with the factory to continue the previous arrangements.</p>
<p>Mediation process:</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the union believed that the factory should not change the work arrangements or impose harsh wages, so it submitted a request to the Municipal Party Headquarters, the People's Training Committee, and the Social Affairs Bureau to send representatives to jointly negotiate with the factory. The factory insisted on its original plan, firmly stating that female workers could process 500 to 600 pounds of tobacco leaves per day and refused to continue the previous arrangements. The higher-level officials decided that on the afternoon of the 9th, representatives of the Municipal People's Training Committee, Wu Jiaze, the Social Affairs Bureau, Qiu Peihao, the Fifth District Party Headquarters, Zhao Bi, and the Union, Chen Peide and Ye Huibing, would enter the factory to observe the female workers' work for one hour to clarify the situation. On that day, the factory designated 20 workers from the new and old factories to work in person. The result was that each worker only produced 22 and a half pounds. The higher-level representatives, realizing the truth, went to the writing room to reopen negotiations with the factory. However, the factory still insisted on its previous view. The representatives could not achieve their goals. The union convened a meeting of female workers from the new and old factories that evening, reported on the negotiation process, and all the workers were extremely indignant. They decided to go on strike together and vowed not to resume work until victory was achieved.</p>
<p>Union mediation:</p>
<p>The union believed that the factory should not change the work arrangements and cause the strike, and that the factory should bear full responsibility for everything. Moreover, they feared that prolonged persistence would expand the unrest, which was a matter of great concern. On the one hand, they convened a general meeting of representatives from each department to discuss the matter. On the other hand, they reported the situation to the higher authorities and requested instructions on how to handle the matter.</p>
<h3>International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea</h3>
<p>The meeting is postponed. The Shanghai Shipping Association previously received instructions from the Ministry of Communications approving the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' advisory opinion regarding whether or not to join all or part of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. It was scheduled to be discussed at the Ministry of Navy in Nanjing on the 13th of this month, and the association was instructed to send representatives to participate. Details were reported yesterday. It is now reported that this meeting was postponed because the translation of the convention text was very time-consuming and could not be completed within the shortest possible time. Without the translated text, there was no way to discuss it at the meeting. The Shipping Association has now received instructions from the Ministry of Communications approving the postponement of the meeting. Once the convention text is translated, the meeting will be rescheduled. It is reported that the Shanghai Shipping Association has approved Chen Ganqing of Zhaoxing Company and Sun Dequan of China Merchants Bureau to attend and participate in the discussions.</p>

<h3>Grain Purchases Must Be Level with the Scale</h3>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Skimming, Tipping, and Depriving Farmers</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received instructions from the Department of Agriculture and Mining to strictly prohibit the misuse of hand scales in grain purchases. The attached original report stated that rice merchants use hand scales when purchasing grains such as rice, wheat, beans, and rapeseed, and do not level them with the scale. Some merchants do not even use hand scales and instead tip them, overcharging farmers by three or four liters per stone. Farmers are often oppressed by this and dare not speak out. Merchants rely on accumulated habits and regard it as a deserved benefit. How can such transactions be considered fair? Farmers toil all year round, and it is difficult to obtain their gains. Yet merchants exploit them to such a cruel extent in the transfer of hands. If this is not strictly prohibited, not only will they be the knife and we the fish, but it will also clearly violate the Prime Minister's intention to support farmers and workers. Now that the spring harvest is about to come to market, it is feared that rice merchants will continue to follow the old ways. Therefore, the county magistrate is ordered to strictly prohibit this and publicize it to the public.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee</h3>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee is scheduled to hold a city-wide representative conference on the 21st of this month to formally establish the Chamber of Commerce. Information on all preparations has been previously reported. It is now reported that the number of representatives from various trade associations who have registered in recent days is very large. However, some have requested an extension due to time constraints. The committee has decided to extend the deadline to the 15th of this month. Representatives of all trade associations must register before the deadline. The announcement and the list of members of the Organizing Committee are recorded below:</p>
<p>Announcement of Extension</p>
<p>We hereby inform you that the deadline for the tasks of electing representatives and submitting proposals for the conference of trade association representatives scheduled for June 21st has passed.

It is requested that you expedite the completion of the report to the committee within the extended deadline so that the committee can print it in advance to avoid delaying the conference. This is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>Organizing Committee</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Resolves to Establish Independently</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Reply to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee</p>
<p>Refusing to Establish a Branch Office. The Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee previously sent a letter to the Wusong Chamber of Commerce requesting that the association handle the closure and establish a branch office. Details were reported previously. It is now reported that after receiving the letter, the association immediately convened all executive and supervisory committee members and held an emergency meeting to discuss the matter. More than 20 committee members, including Zhang Yuchi, Dong Mengyi, Zheng Shushan, and Wang Yingru, attended the meeting. As a result of the discussion, because Wusong is located on the coast, in addition to calico and miscellaneous grains, it is also a major producer of fish, pork, and seafood. Therefore, the river is lined with帆牆 (sails), which cannot be compared to ordinary markets. The number of incidents requiring resolution every day is numerous. It is necessary to have a more powerful formal commercial organization to assist and maintain them in order to immediately resolve the impact, which is a serious matter. Therefore, it was unanimously resolved to establish an independent office and not to establish a branch office. The association's reply to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee yesterday is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Respectfully replying,</p>
<p>We received your letter stating (omitted as it was seen in the previous report). The Association believes that the proposed reorganization came suddenly and caused surprise and doubt after its dissemination. Therefore, we urgently convened a meeting of the executive and supervisory committees to discuss the matter impartially. We also considered the trends and sought legal interpretations. It was generally agreed that the Association's existence has its own history and achievements. Even if we want to reduce our burden, we cannot violate commercial sentiment. We have described the Association's commercial situation, its history of handling affairs, and the various studies of the natural commercial area. We have studied its relationship and speculated on its changes. Some say that if a branch office is established, can its effects be perfect? If the branch office reports to the Shanghai Association, can its response be timely? After repeated deliberations, it seems that there are some improprieties. It is easier to talk about reform than to talk about construction. Today, the position of the Association is to pay attention to construction. Instead of being passive to reduce responsibility, it is better to be active to benefit the local area. Moreover, once there is a change, I am afraid that the impact of forcing debt will be enough to destroy the credit maintained by the name. This is a major concern. Before replying to the letter, a hundred thoughts were gathered, and the meaning of the colleagues was written into a concise passage (omitted). What I dare to believe is that this is not the private statement of one person, but the true picture of the group. I respectfully submit this to you and ask you to consider it carefully and quickly withdraw the proposal to reorganize the Wusong Chamber of Commerce. I am extremely grateful.</p>
<h3>Strictly Prohibiting the Shipment of Copper Coins to Japan</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Ordered Customs Supervisors to Implement the Order. The Shanghai Jianghai Customs Supervisor received instructions from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had sent a telegram from the Consul in Nagasaki, Japan, stating that unscrupulous merchants were transporting copper coins to Japan and destroying them for profit. It was requested that this be investigated and prohibited. The relevant departments should be ordered to strictly patrol and intercept any Chinese and Japanese ships exporting from Shanghai in order to maintain the market.</p>
<p>Foreign Ships Anchoring on the Banks of Anhui Province</p>
<h3>Resistance and Renovation by Chinese Shipping Merchants</h3>
<p>Since the Anhui Provincial Government replied to Shanghai, indicating that the establishment of a public dock in Anqing was imperative, whether or not foreign ships should be allowed to dock was another matter. Upon receiving this news, Chinese shipping merchants in Shanghai felt quite uneasy. They have put forward fundamental objections on the one hand, and have renovated the docks in Anhui on the other hand. The follow-up measures for resistance and renovation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Another Basis for Refusing Berthing. The fact that foreign ships are not allowed to berth in Anqing has already been noted in the Sino-British Yantai Treaty. Shanghai shipping businesses have already presented this to strive for this. Now, the companies have found that when the China Merchants Bureau was first established, its director, Tang Jingsing, had signed an agreement with the British merchants, Jardine Matheson and Taikoo, which stipulated: (1) Foreign ships are not allowed to go to Wenzhou port; (2) Only Jardine Matheson ships are allowed to go to Fuzhou port, and Taikoo ships are not allowed to go; (3) Taikoo ships are allowed to stop at Xiamen port, but Jardine Matheson ships are not allowed to go; (4) In the Yangtze River, foreign ships are not allowed to stop at Anqing and Datong ports. At that time, the representatives of the foreign merchants signed this agreement, and the original document is still preserved by the companies. The ability of Chinese ships to maintain a portion of their operations over the past 50 years has depended on the restrictions of this agreement. Now, the Anhui government's advocacy of building a port to attract foreign ships is actually intended to overturn this agreement. If the restricted areas also request to follow suit, will Chinese ships have any hope of survival? This has now been used as a basis for strong opposition.</p>
<p>Renovation of Chinese Merchants' Wanzai Ships. Both the China Merchants Bureau and the Sanbei Company have docks and安置躉船 (Wanzai ships) in Anqing, which are used to facilitate passengers and cargo to go up and down. Now, the Anhui government has criticized them as being破爛躉船 (dilapidated Wanzai ships) that endanger travel. The China Merchants Bureau first transferred the new Wuhu Wanzai ship to Anqing and ordered the Anhui Bureau chief to invite representatives from all sectors to visit the actual situation of the renovated Wanzai port. The Sanbei Company also decided to replace the Anqing dock with a new Wanzai ship and expand the cargo capacity.</p>
<p>Preferential Treatment of Reduced Freight Rates. At the last meeting of the Yangtze River Six Companies in 1930, it was agreed to increase freight rates for上水貨物 (upstream cargo) by 15% in each port. However, the Chinese shipping companies gave preferential treatment to Hakka merchants from Anhui and reduced the rate by 5%, excluding Anqing port and only adding 10%.</p>
<h3>Military Department Investigates Military Property</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Military Affairs sent Chen Rulin, Ru Dekui, Xu Zhensheng and other staff members of the營造司 (Construction Department) of the military supplies department to Shanghai to investigate military properties, and set up an office in the Guandi Temple in 埠門 (Bu Men) in Shanghai. It is said that after the results of reports and investigations in recent days, there have been more than 20 locations. Yesterday, they went to the Gaochang Temple Arsenal to investigate. After the matter is completed, they will still need to go to Longhua and Wusong. It will take about a month to complete the matter and report it to the Military Department.</p>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Weaving Association</p>
<h3>Convening a Conference to Help Silk Cocoons</h3>
<p>Scheduled to be held on the 22nd of this month. The Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Weaving Association sent a letter to the silk merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces yesterday, stating:</p>
<p>Our association has received reports from various places in the two provinces that this year's cocoon harvest has been poor. In addition, foreign merchants are absorbing fresh cocoons as much as possible, resulting in a shortage of silk production and insufficient raw materials for weaving silk. The prices of new silk are soaring, more than 20% higher than old silk. The cost of silk weaving has risen sharply, and there is a shortage of raw materials that cannot be purchased. It is difficult to maintain operations. If this continues and we do not find ways to help, we will have to stop work. Foreign silk will take the opportunity to import and national silk will inevitably be eliminated, resulting in unemployment. This is a serious matter for the national economy and the people's livelihood. We should ask your association to quickly convene an emergency meeting of silk merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to discuss relief measures.</p>
<p>The association believes that silk is a major product of our country and has a significant impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, we should urgently seek relief. It is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting of all provinces in Jiangsu and Zhejiang at 3:00 PM on the 22nd of this month at the association's location in Shanghai Nine Acres to jointly seek relief methods and discuss important proposals such as reducing and exempting silk donations and retaining raw materials. We ask that your association/guild/members invite colleagues from all treasure houses and factories to attend and participate in the discussions on time.</p>
<h3>News on the Preparation of the National Products Department Store</h3>
<p>Since the preparation of the China National Products Department Store, progress has been relatively smooth. The number of people going to obtain application forms in recent days has been quite enthusiastic. The person in charge of the preparation, Zhang Zilian, especially hosted a banquet at the Atlantic Hotel the other evening (the 9th) to invite more than 50 collection committee members to leading figures in the national products industry. Zhang Zilian rose to speak, saying that China's industry is not prosperous, and imported goods are flooding the market. As a result, rights and interests are lost every day, and the economy is invaded every day. The way to save the situation is to promote national products. In recent years, people from all over the country have been working hard on this and have organized exhibitions. However, the prosperous Nanjing Road in Shanghai is still lacking. I have gathered like-minded people to organize a China National Products Department Store. The location is the entire building of the former Shanghai Municipal Government on Nanjing Road. However, this matter is a major matter and relies on the concerted efforts of the masses. I hope that all colleagues will do their best to assist us in achieving complete success. How happy would I, Zilian, be? Xu Genghua, Wu Mai, Li Heyun, Lu Xingzhuang, Wang Hanqiang, Cha Renwei, Chen Yiting, and Hu Juewen spoke successively. Finally, the chairman gave a reply, and the meeting ended in joy.</p>
<h3>Reinvigorating the Export of Chinese Tea to Russia</h3>
<p>Russian merchants are flocking to Shanghai to procure goods, and Sino-Russian commerce has largely returned to its original state. Russian merchants have also successively arrived in Shanghai to trade in Chinese tea. Recently, with the soaring price of gold and the plummeting price of silver, opportunities for export trade are extremely favorable. Therefore, Russian tea merchants in Shanghai have been doing their utmost to collect Chinese tea in recent days. Transactions at the Russian Merchants Association on Beijing Road have been particularly prosperous, and the tea market has been quite active. A large batch of Chinese tea is about to be shipped to Russia, and there is hope for a resurgence in Sino-Russian trade.</p>
<h3>The Rise and Fall of Coastal Shipping</h3>
<p>Flourishing Foreign Vessels on the South China Route / Weak Chinese Vessels on All Sea Routes: The new tea crop has already entered the market and must be transshipped to Fujian to be scented with flowers. Recently, more than 30,000 boxes of new tea have been shipped from various places to Shanghai, urgently awaiting transshipment to Fujian for scenting. However, Chinese shipping merchants in Shanghai, lacking seagoing vessels to dispatch, are unable to move the goods, causing great anxiety among the merchants. There is nothing they can do about it.</p>
<p>Goods from Southeast Asia Pile Up in Shanghai for Shipment to Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangzhou: Recently, goods bound for Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangzhou are extremely congested in Shanghai. Foreign firms in Shanghai, such as Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, and Nissin Shipping, are exporting over 20,000 pieces of cargo per voyage. Especially large are the shipments of foreign yarn, piece goods, and miscellaneous grains. As a result, eight British vessels and two Japanese vessels sail each week, depriving the twenty-eight Chinese ships of their business.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains Can Be Shipped: Previously, the Guangzhou Miscellaneous Grains Guild and Jardine Matheson had an unresolved dispute over compensation for a shortage of goods, leading to a boycott. Recently, recognizing the abundance of goods, the guild has voluntarily conceded and agreed with the Guangdong merchants on a compensation plan. The Miscellaneous Grains Guild has now rescinded its ban on transportation, and loading has resumed as usual.</p>
<p>Reopening of the Haizhou Route: After the outbreak of war on the Longhai Railway, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haizhou route was suspended. Recently, with the Tonghua vessel having been repaired, the company has decided to reopen the Haizhou route from today, serving the three counties of Hai, Chong, and Qi.</p>
<h3>Completion of Newly Built Bandit Suppression Gunboats</h3>
<p>Gong Mianqin Appointed Commander-in-Chief: Local public groups in the three counties of Chongming, Qidong, and Haimen, in order to subsidize the water police in strictly suppressing pirates and ensuring local peace, raised a large sum of money to build two bandit suppression gunboats, named Zhenhai and Zhendong. These have already been successively completed, launched, and are now being fitted with guns. The county heads of the three counties have decided to appoint Gong Mianqin, commander of the 17th Detachment of the 4th Water Police District, as commander-in-chief, and to appoint Fei Handong, commander of the 2nd Platoon of that detachment, as captain of the Zhendong, and Wen Guangming, commander of the 3rd Platoon, as captain of the Zhenhai. They have already sent a request to Zhu Bingzheng, district chief of the 4th Water Police District of Wusong, for separate commissions.</p>
<h3>Aftermath of Hail Damage in Minhang Western Suburbs</h3>
<p>District Chief Wu Requests County Government Relief: On the 7th of this month, Xihe Bridge in the western part of Minhang Town, Shanghai County, suddenly suffered hail damage, resulting in severe losses. After the incident, the township heads petitioned the First District Public Office to send personnel to conduct on-site inspections and to find ways to provide relief. This was reported yesterday. It is now known that District Chief Wu, after receiving the petition, specially prepared a document to submit to the county government, requesting that personnel be sent to conduct on-site inspections and provide relief. The original petition is excerpted below:</p>
<p>"Petition Reporting Factual Damage to Crops Due to Wind and Hail:</p>
<p>It is a fact that this district has suffered successive disasters in recent years, and the people's livelihoods are precarious. Since the beginning of summer this year, we have been fortunate to have fine weather and a suitable climate. The two wheat crops and various by-products have matured to about 60-70%, and the cotton and rice seedlings, on which farmers depend for their livelihoods, have also been planted on time. It was hoped that from now on, the weather would be favorable and the climate harmonious, so that we could have a promising autumn harvest. Unexpectedly, at 3 p.m. on the 7th of this month, the sky suddenly turned dark, and there was a sudden thunderstorm, followed by violent hail and strong winds. As a result, the growing cotton and bean seedlings, the ripe rapeseed waiting to be harvested, as well as vegetables and fruits, etc., were suddenly hit by a strong blow, resulting in severe losses. According to reports from various sources, the damage to crops from this hail is unprecedented. The disaster is obvious, and relief is difficult. Although the villagers are now rushing to buy seeds for replanting, it is past the planting season, and it will be difficult to achieve good results. After receiving the report, the District Chief immediately went to the countryside in person for a thorough inspection and confirmed that the branches and leaves of the crops in the fields had been scattered, broken, and fallen to the ground by the wind and hail, with only one or two out of ten remaining, a truly pitiful sight. Considering that farmers work hard all year round, hoping only for a good autumn harvest to pay their national taxes and support their families, they are now facing this unexpected disaster, and the future is unbearable. In addition to notifying the villagers to quickly purchase seeds for replanting in the hope of mitigating the disaster, I hereby report the hail damage in full detail, hoping that your Excellency will review and approve this matter and dispatch personnel to conduct on-site inspections and provide relief, which would be in the public interest. Respectfully submitted, Wu Jingqing, District Chief of the First District of Shanghai County, Yan."</p>
<h3>Xu Jingren Prepares for Disaster Relief in War Zones</h3>
<p>Chairman Xu Jingren of the Relief Committee has been ordered by the National Government to prepare for disaster relief in war zones. In addition to the relief funds separately allocated by the Ministry of Finance for 100,000 yuan, Xu, thinking that the Guidet area has suffered war damage and that the hot weather now may lead to epidemics, and it is necessary to prevent them early, specially published an advertisement to solicit medicines for war zone disaster relief. It is also heard that he has sent letters to the major merchants in Shanghai, Cheng Linsheng, and the pharmaceutical magnate, Huang Chuqiu, requesting them to promote and donate. It is believed that many kind-hearted people in Shanghai and major Chinese and foreign pharmaceutical merchants will generously contribute, which is fortunate for the disaster victims in the war zones.</p>
<h3>Fundraising for Urgent Relief in Shaanxi and Henan Provinces</h3>
<p>The disaster situation in Shaanxi and Henan provinces is serious. At this time of year, when the old harvest is gone and the new harvest is not yet in, relief is especially urgent. Previously, due to traffic obstruction and inconvenient transportation, it was difficult to start relief efforts. Now, Zhu Ziqiao, director of the Relief Committee's office in Beiping, has, after consulting with the authorities, secured the allocation of vehicles to transport grain and personally went to investigate and provide relief to the disaster victims, benefiting many. From now on, with convenient transportation, it will be possible to thoroughly implement rescue efforts. However, the disaster area is too wide. Although the Relief Committee has successively remitted relief funds, it is still insufficient. Chairman Xu of the Relief Committee and Wang Yiting, director of the Shanghai office, have published an advertisement to solicit urgent relief for Shaanxi and Henan provinces, hoping that compatriots at home and abroad and all sectors of Shanghai will contribute a small amount of funds to save the disaster victims. It is heard that the relief funds received by the committee will be remitted to Zhu Ziqiao in Beiping for distribution, in order to save as many lives as possible with each contribution. The sooner the relief funds are received, the sooner lives can be saved.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Jiangsu Provisional Relief Association</h3>
<p>The 25th Committee Meeting: Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the Jiangsu Provisional Relief Association held its 25th committee meeting. Committee members present included Wang Yiting, Huang Boyu, Huang Hanzhi, Jiao Leshan, Zhu Xiechen, Lu Shaoliu, Cheng Yiqing, and over ten others.</p>
<p>Reported Items:</p>
<p>(1) Director Zhang reported by letter that 1,030 households in Jiangyin had been surveyed for relief, with 3,086 yuan distributed, and 414 yuan used to subsidize labor relief and stabilize rice prices.</p>
<p>(2) General Inspector Qiao sent a letter of thanks for the delegation sent to offer condolences.</p>
<p>(3) Director Liu reported by letter that 7,938 households in Huaian had been surveyed for relief, with 31,542 yuan distributed, and 2,458 yuan used to subsidize relief in the city and suburbs and provide alms to beggars.</p>
<p>(4) Director Zhu telegraphed that 10,348 households in Xingchun had been surveyed for relief, with 35,216.5 yuan distributed, and 174 hidden poor households had been surveyed, with 783.5 yuan distributed.</p>
<p>(5) County Magistrate Li of Jiangyin replied by letter that Jiangyin had supervised the completion of the distribution and thanked the committee on behalf of the disaster victims.</p>
<p>(6) The association received a letter from the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs stating that it had approved the county's use of 2,400 yuan in relief funds to stabilize rice prices and requested remittance of the funds. It was decided to proceed with the remittance.</p>
<p>(7) Mr. Li Yushu forwarded a letter from Chen Tingju and others from various public groups in Siyang, reporting that the county had suffered severe banditry and a failure of the wheat harvest, and that the disaster situation was dire. It was decided that Mr. Li had already discussed the matter with Chairman Huang Hanzhi, who said that he would conduct an investigation on his return to Pu and that if the disaster situation was mild, the Huaian Jisheng Branch would handle the relief efforts, while if the situation was severe, the Shanghai Jisheng Association and this association would provide relief. The case will be decided after Mr. Li returns.</p>
<p>(8) The relief funds for Dongtai were insufficient. Previously, a telegram was sent to the Department of Finance requesting that the 10,000 yuan in relief funds allocated to the county be changed to cash and handed over to this association for distribution, but no reply has been received. The Xinghua Relief Bureau has now concluded its work and is about to close. It was decided to telegram Director Zhu to conduct an initial investigation in Dongtai with 4,500 yuan as the scope, and to continue to telegram the Department of Finance to investigate the case and allocate cash.</p>
<p>(9) The association's relief funds have been exhausted, but there are still many funds waiting to be allocated. The Provincial Department of Finance has repeatedly telegraphed urging the allocation, but no reply has been received. It was decided to telegram the Department of Finance again to urge the allocation and to recommend that Chairman Wang go to negotiate.</p>
<p>Ad Hoc Motions:</p>
<p>(1) Chairman Huang Hanzhi proposed that the disaster situation in Yixing was dire and that the Jisheng Association should jointly contribute 10,000 yuan with this association to select those most in need of relief. The selection of a person in charge should be delegated by this association. The county had previously received 2,400 yuan from the province. It was asked if the association could add another 2,600 yuan, along with the Jisheng Association's funds, and immediately dispatch personnel to handle the matter. It was decided to telegram the Yixing County Government and Mr. Zhu Yuting, stating that if the previously allocated provincial funds had not been used, they should be handled according to the proposal.</p>
<p>(2) Director Liu Shulun requested that the committee discuss the situation in Suqian, where the flood disaster was severe and the banditry was even worse. It was requested that the committee give consideration to the disaster victims and provide relief as soon as possible. It was decided to telegram the Provincial Government with the information.</p>
<h3>Jisheng Association Held Important Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association held a joint meeting of the supervisory and executive committees at 3:00 PM yesterday to report on relief efforts and to establish new branches. Those present included Chairman Wang Yiting, Vice Chairman Xu Qianlin, Vice Chairman Huang Hanzhi, and over twenty other committee members. The following items were discussed:</p>
<p>(1) A relief director reported that the association had handled relief efforts in Shaanxi, Zhejiang, Ping, Yu, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces from February 3 to June 4 of the 19th year of the Republic, a total of four months. The total amount received was several million yuan, and the total amount spent was also several million yuan. The disaster area was vast, and the relief funds were meager, making it difficult to provide effective relief. The actual expenses were enormous and insufficient, with over 112,700 yuan borrowed and advanced.</p>
<p>(2) Director Liu Shulun reported on relief efforts in Bao Ying, Jiangsu. The most heavily affected and poorest areas in the eastern, southern, and northern villages of the disaster area in Bao Ying were selected for special relief, with a minimum of 3-7 yuan for each household, totaling over 49,000 yuan. All impoverished disaster households in the city and suburban villages have been surveyed and provided relief. The report forms, receipts, and other evidence will be sent to the association for review in the near future.</p>
<p>(3) A committee member reported that Yixing, Jiangsu, was requesting relief. The disaster situation in the county was dire, with a county-wide rice shortage. Local gentry, led by Mr. Zhu Yuting, were running around begging for relief, but the slow pace of relief could not meet the urgent need. It was proposed to provide emergency relief by stabilizing rice prices and providing immediate relief. The most important areas for immediate relief were the southeast and southwest of the Shankou area. It was replied that manpower and financial resources were lacking, and it would be difficult to fulfill the request. A relief director said that the only way to provide relief in Yixing was for Chairman Huang to discuss the matter with the Jiangsu Relief Association and work together to find a solution. There were no objections.</p>
<p>(4) Chairman Wang proposed that the association had previously allocated 10,000 yuan to Nanhui for labor relief to repair the Jigong Dyke. After the dyke was repaired, over 3,000 yuan was collected in taxes and deposited in the county's public funds. It was proposed to allocate 1,000-2,000 yuan to stabilize rice prices and provide emergency relief in the Zhoupu Township of Nanhui. This was considered a public service for the public good, and the gentry of Nanhui were moving to use these funds. It was necessary to report the facts to the association, which would approve an allocation of 1,000 or 2,000 yuan. There were no objections.</p>
<p>(5) A relief director reported that the business community and various charitable organizations in Yongjia, Zhejiang, believed that the association had achieved excellent results and had unanimously agreed to establish a Wenzhou Chengjia branch. Letters had been received from various sectors requesting the establishment of a branch and providing a list of names, which was read aloud in public. The personnel were from the business community, money shops, and charitable organizations. Chairman Huang Hanzhi said that the initiators had been carefully examined, their character was upright, they were deeply familiar with the association's principles, and they were able to help the association with their heart for relief. It was decided that the proposal could be approved. There were no objections.</p>
<p>After the above five items were proposed and completed, the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3>The Effectiveness of Ericsson Automatic Telephones</h3>
<p>Telephone expert Mr. Kaiser says that the convenience and low cost of telephones are of great importance to both users and shareholders. Mr. Kaiser, with extensive experience in managing Ericsson automatic telephone exchanges, confirms that the Ericsson system is the most complete. Its clear communication, accurate and reliable operation, and its popularity have lasted for fifty years. Its advantages are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Ericsson automatic exchange occupies less than half the space of other types of automatic exchanges, making management simple and inexpensive, and resulting in significant savings in building and foundation costs.</p>
<p>(2) The machine consumes very little power. Assuming that there are 10,000 subscribers and that each subscriber makes ten calls within 24 hours, each call lasting about two minutes, the power consumption is only 48 degrees.</p>
<p>(3) The electrical potential of the telephone line is extremely low, and the equipment is tightly sealed to prevent leakage from the lines and the automatic exchange.</p>
<p>(4) The Ericsson automatic exchange requires very few workers to manage. For example, an automatic exchange with 10,000 subscribers requires only nine people to manage, averaging only two and a half hours of management time per subscriber per year. In addition, the convenience and economy of current switches and the simplicity of adding telephone lines have been proven by the Ericsson Telephone Company over a long period of time. The telephone bureau has decided to adopt Ericsson automatic telephones in major cities in Sweden. The company responsible for handling this automatic telephone project in Shanghai is Weichang Foreign Firm on Jiangxi Road.</p>

<p>Bus Driver's Life in Danger</p>
<p>More Than Ten Passengers Injured</p>
<p>Why Doesn't the Railway Repair the Gate?: At 8:40 PM last night, a train and a public bus collided at the railway gate at Gejiazhui on Jiangwan Road. The train head caused a great disaster, and the public bus was thrown more than ten feet into the air due to the severe impact. More than ten passengers in the bus were injured, including the driver and the ticket collector. The driver suffered the most serious injuries, being on the verge of death. Among the passengers, a woman and a man also suffered serious injuries. They are currently being treated at Jisheng Hospital. The public bus involved in the accident was Route 1, No. 13, with a public utility bureau license plate number of 4177, operating between the North Station and Jiangwan. The Songhu train departed from the North Station at 8:25 PM.</p>
<p>Appearing From the Sky: Since the Songhu Line switched to using steam light trains, the number of round trips between Shanghai and Wusong Fort Taiwan has increased significantly every day. The places where it passes through the road are surrounded by wooden fences and separated by iron gates, so it's safe. The Huashang public bus operating on Jiangwan Road runs from the North Station to Jiangwan along the same direction as the railway. However, the section of Jiangwan Road from the end of Bazilu to the East Road of the Sports Association was built by the Public Works Bureau beyond its boundaries. The public bus travels north from Baoshan Road to the Gejiazhui railway gate, where it crosses the railway and enters the East Road of the Sports Association. Last night at 8:40 PM, the 33rd Songhu train departing from the North Station was traveling east to the Gejiazhui gate at the east end of Caijiazhai when a Route 1, No. 4177 public bus was traveling from the south. It was turning to the east, crossing the railway to turn. The two gates were not closed. The public bus failed to brake in time and collided with the train. The train was powerful, and the public bus was no match for it. In an instant, the bus was pushed to the side of the road by the train. Due to the force being too great, the bus body rose from the ground and was thrown forward more than ten feet. After hearing a loud crash, the passersby saw the bus thrown down from the sky, making a huge noise when it hit the ground. Its right-wing car was badly damaged, and its wheels were stuck in the mud, with the whole wheel fully submerged.</p>
<p>Passengers Crying for Help: After the two vehicles collided, the train continued to move forward with a whistle, heading north. However, the passengers of the public bus suffered greatly and cried out loudly for help. The driver, who was sitting close to the front of the bus, suffered the most serious injuries and was unconscious at the time, with blood flowing from his head, face, and chest. Passengers sitting near the right side of the bus were also severely injured, but passengers sitting near the rear of the bus suffered less injury because of the distance. At that time, there were about 11-12 passengers in the bus. Apart from the few passengers sitting at the back of the bus, the rest were injured, totaling ten people including the driver and the ticket collector. Residents nearby gathered to watch. Mr. Brandt, a Westerner from the Pike Dairy Company at No. 1 Caijiazhai, witnessed the tragic injuries of the passengers and helped the police transport the injured to Jisheng Hospital for treatment in his own car.</p>
<p>The Door Is Set Up But Often Open: The west side of the Gejiazhui railway gate is damaged, so the gate cannot be fully closed when the train passes. The gate is only guarded by road workers with ropes to stop pedestrians and vehicles. The gate has existed, but it is often open these days. According to witnesses, the train was not traveling very fast because it was approaching the gate from the south. The public bus also could not drive fast because it was turning. If the gate could have been fully closed, this tragedy might not have happened. Even if there were red and green lights and ropes, it would have been of no use since the two vehicles were already close to each other.</p>
<p>Bus Badly Damaged: When the reporter heard the news and went to the scene of the accident, he saw that the public bus was stuck in the mud, with its head facing north and its side facing west. It was standing on the road. Its roof could be reached with a hand. The damaged bus was about ten and a half feet away from the sign in front of the gate that says (Be Careful of the Train, Pedestrians Stop, Danger), and about two yards from the west side of the railway. The right front wheel and carriage were the most badly damaged, and the rear left side was relatively complete. The engine, the driver's seat, and the glass windows at the front of the bus all suffered serious damage. Only two of the seats inside the bus remained, and the wallboards were thrown more than ten feet away, which shows the severity of the impact.</p>

<h3>Falling into a Deep Sleep</h3>
<p>Beware on the Train</p>
<p>A Stranger Offers Cigarettes</p>
<p>A Seal Officer Greatly Deceived</p>
<p>Luggage and Gown Stolen</p>
<p>Mao Zhixiang, a 23-year-old man from Fenghua serving as a seal officer at the Nanjing General Headquarters, received a telegram from home a few days ago and planned to return. On the morning of the eighth, he took several pieces of luggage and boarded the 11:00 Shanghai-Nanjing train to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, there was a young, handsome passenger on the train, dressed luxuriously, appearing to be about twenty years old. At first, they exchanged names, and then they talked more and more intimately. The other passengers suspected they were traveling together and paid no attention. Mao secretly thought that having a companion on the train would alleviate some of the boredom. Little did he expect that the ways of the world are no longer what they used to be, and joy turned to sorrow. The young man offered Mao a cigarette, which Mao accepted out of politeness, and they smoked and chatted happily. Who knew that as the cigarette was finishing, Mao suddenly felt his mind clouding, his spirit flagging, and he collapsed in his seat. The young man, seeing his plan had worked, immediately searched Mao's luggage and gown and stole them. When the train arrived at a certain station, he took the stolen goods and fled. In the evening, when the train arrived at the North Station, the passengers disembarked one after another, but Mao Zhixiang remained sound asleep. The conductor checked and found him unresponsive, so he helped him off the train and out of the station. However, Mao stumbled like a drunkard. He was then discovered by Chinese Constable No. 2175 from the Huishi Police Station, who suspected his behavior and immediately detained him in the police station for the night. The next morning around eight o'clock, seeing that Mao's mind was still unclear, he ordered the constable to send him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Only after the doctor administered medicine did Mao suddenly wake up. Afterwards, Mao told people that it was like a dream. Recalling the situation on the train, he was filled with remorse. This is also a new trick in Shanghai. Private prostitute Wang Yueqin.</p>

Therefore, she came to Shanghai the year before last and lives at No. 882, Hongxing Lane, Beijing Road. This alley is a place where wild flowers mingle, and Yueqin has long been assimilated. Every evening, she puts on heavy makeup and goes to the three major amusement parks to engage in her corrupting activities. However, Yueqin has a cousin in her original hometown of Hangzhou, whose husband died, leaving behind three children. At a time when rice is as precious as pearls and firewood is as expensive as cinnamon, their lives are unsustainable. Yueqin once lied about how prosperous Shanghai is and suggested that her cousin's eldest daughter might as well go to Shanghai to work, where she could earn a lot of money. Her cousin believed her and sent her eldest daughter, Yueying, who was only fourteen years old, and her second daughter, Yuegu, who was only ten years old, to Shanghai to live in Yueqin's home. However, Yueqin is a prostitute, and now that she has these young girls, she plans to use them to</p>
<h3>360,000 Already Signed Yesterday</h3>

<h3>French Concession Hot Water Price Increase</h3>
<p>From the 15th of this month, all hot water stove businesses (ie. "tiger stoves") in the French Concession will increase their prices. This is due to recent increases in rent and water prices, as well as the general rise in the cost of living. Various expenses have doubled. After repeated gatherings of the businesses, they revised the water prices and submitted them to the French Municipal Council for approval. From the 15th of this month, all hot water sold by the tiger stoves in the entire French Concession will be increased in price. - Hongchang Hardware Store</p>
<h3>Lawsuit to Recover Relocation Losses</h3>
<p>The trial concluded yesterday and sentencing is pending. Last year, Huang Chu-jiu leased houses in the Fuxing Lane area of Zhejiang Road from the owner, Xi Eh-xian. He then notified all tenants that they had to move out by August 1st in order to demolish and rebuild. At that time, the tenants formed a union to resist the landlord. Later, the Commercial and Regulatory Association intervened and mediated a settlement, compensating the tenants 65,000 yuan for their losses, and the turmoil subsided. However, Hongchang Hardware Store, one of the tenants, claimed to have suffered various losses due to the relocation and hired a lawyer to sue the owner, Xi Eh-xian, for damages. Yesterday morning, the case was heard again by Judge Ying Shi, head of the civil court of the Special District Court. The plaintiff, Hongchang Hardware Store, sent an accountant with account books to prove that the relocation expenses, goods auction, new house renovation, new house rent, business reduction, and other losses amounted to a total of 16,000 yuan. However, a review of the accounts showed that they were not entirely consistent. The defense lawyer for the defendant, Xi Eh-xian, Jiang Yi-ping, argued that Xi had leased the houses to Huang Chu-jiu, so Huang Chu-jiu was responsible for the demolition and rebuilding after August 1st last year, and Xi had nothing to do with it. Moreover, the plaintiff originally intended to move, so the losses were not related to the demolition. Besides, Xi had already paid 65,000 yuan to the tenants as relocation fees on behalf of Huang. The five types of losses claimed by the plaintiff were all unreasonable according to the witnesses' statements. For example, the moving fee should not be requested from him since the thick notice did not relate to the demolition. Also, as for the auction of goods, the plaintiff was a hardware store, and all the goods were made of copper and iron, which are not easily damaged, so there should be no loss. As for the renovation and rent, one was what the plaintiff should have done due to the relocation, and the other had no evidence to prove it. As for the reduction of business, it was due to the rise and fall of the market and had nothing to do with the demolition. Therefore, he requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. Finally, the plaintiff's lawyer gave a rebuttal. Judge Ying adjourned the court and announced that the sentencing would be scheduled for a later date.</p>
<h3>A Twelve-Year-Old Girl Walks from Songjiang to Old Longhua</h3>
<p>She planned to visit her aunt in Shanghai, but she did not know the way. She was sent to the bureau to wait for her family to claim her. Liang Qi-wen, a patrolman from the Longhua sub-station of the third section of the sixth district of the Shanghai Special Municipal Public Security Bureau, saw a girl with short hair wandering on the street around 8 p.m. the night before. She was wearing gray cloth shirt and pants, with broken cloth shoes and no socks, sobbing softly. He immediately took her back to the station. After a brief interrogation by Chief Liu, she said that her name was Qian A-cheng, twelve years old, from Jiaoqiaotou, Songjiang. Her father's name was Qian Jin-sheng, who was doing business in Minglizhan, Songjiang. Her mother was dead. She said, "My aunt lives upstairs in the Changsheng Fruit Shop on Caishi Street, Dongxinqiao, Shanghai. My uncle is called A-rong, and he is the owner of the Changsheng Fruit Shop. Today, I left home alone to find my aunt in Shanghai. I walked to Longhua Station, but I didn't know the way, and it was getting late, so I was brought here by the patrolman." Chief Liu said that a young and weak girl should not travel alone for such a long distance for fear of being abducted or other things happening to her. He immediately prepared a document and sent it to the Public Security Bureau to temporarily keep her until her family claimed her.</p>

<h3>Autopsy of a Woman Who Died Tragically</h3>
<p>Gong, the third wife of Qu Gui-sheng, the owner of the Shengji Bicycle Shop at No. 170, Avenue Albert, French Concession, went out to buy something on the evening of the 8th. She met a relative and went to the Great World to play. They separated after 12 o'clock. Because she was in a hurry to go home, she hired a rickshaw pulled by Xu Yun-zhong from Jiangbei, who was waiting on the side of Rue de la Course in front of the Empire Theater. Before they had gone a few steps, a drunk Russian driving a car that was going the wrong way crashed head-on into the rickshaw, injuring Gong's head. She immediately fainted. The rickshaw was smashed to pieces, and the rickshaw puller also suffered a bruised right leg. Patrolman No. 267 rushed to the scene and detained the Russian who caused the accident at the police station. The injured person was sent to Renji Hospital, but she died due to her serious injuries. The body was taken to the morgue for an autopsy. All the details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the Russian's name is Miskranenko, and he is a bodyguard at Apici, a Westerner at the Asia Petroleum Company. The car he was driving has license plate number 10468. Yesterday morning, the Vehicle Affairs Office of the French Police summoned witnesses and reported to Judge Zhu of the French Court. At 11 a.m., he arrived at the morgue to examine the body, took his seat, and inspected the corpse. According to the report from the head of the Vehicle Affairs Office, he presented a map of the accident site and brought the defendant to the case for questioning. The plaintiff, the deceased's husband, Qu Gui-sheng, asked for justice. According to the witness, Hua Pu No. 267, the defendant was at fault in four points. After Mr. Zhu questioned the defendant, he ordered that the deceased Qu Gong was indeed injured in the head by a car before her death and should be photographed. The family was told to prepare a coffin and collect the body. The defendant was detained pending investigation and trial in the court. After the autopsy, the family collected the body and placed it in the Bing House. At the same time, they hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the French Court.</p>

<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 p.m. yesterday stated that the weather would be sunny and hot. There would be southern winds on the Shandong and northern coasts, while the south would have gentle and directionless winds with occasional windless zones. The highest temperature in the city in the 24 hours before 3 p.m. yesterday was 83.7 degrees, and the lowest was 64.4 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 87.8 degrees and the lowest was 67.0 degrees. Letter Received Your newspaper published a report on the enlarged meeting of the Quan Wan Guild on the 8th. The second proposal discussed was a letter from youth societies and groups stating that the Dangtu Nanshan Iron Mine was transferred to the Japanese Mitsui Company by Xu Guoan and others in the name of the Limin Company. They requested joint efforts to stop this transfer in order to protect national sovereignty, and it was resolved to send a telegram to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining to cancel the approval and punish them. This is deeply shocking. The sale of minerals from the Limin Company, which I operate, to Japanese merchants is indeed a fact, but it has been approved by the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining. The society considers the sale of minerals to Japanese merchants to be a transfer, which is a false rumor. The guild made a hasty resolution to send a telegram to the ministry without investigation, which is a complete misunderstanding. I hereby make a solemn statement in advance. Xu Guoan. The following is a message from the National Central Research Institute. I recently read a section in your newspaper's local news column in the June 10th edition regarding the Central Research Institute sending personnel to Europe to investigate the newspaper industry. Upon investigation, our Institute of Social Sciences does not have an overseas researcher position, and Mr. Cheng Ping has not held any position in the institute. The information contained in your newspaper may be a mistake from the Peking Research Institute. Please check and make the correction. Sincerely, the Documents Division of the National Central Research Institute.</p>

The former exam site is divided into three cities, and all public and private junior high schools will participate, totaling more than 100 schools with 3,000 students. The latter exam site has a total of twenty-one cities and private schools that have registered to participate. The number of schools is many times higher than middle schools, and there are nearly ten thousand students. At that time, people gather in one room, hunch over their desks and move their pens, which is sure to be quite the sight to see. This move to follow the continental European faction is indeed the educational policy applied in our country, but it is quite difficult to implement easily. Test questions are based on the bureau's preparations for the general examination. It is said that it has been going on for two months. Two-tenths of the staff were sent in advance to check the graduates and their books in each school, and the results were thoroughly studied and questions were prepared according to the Ministry of Education's promulgated middle and elementary school curriculum standards. According to people in the bureau, the test questions this time, except for English, are all in Chinese, and the method is based on testing principles, combined with general questions. Trigonometry is not included in mathematics, which will surely make the examinees very happy. The scoring standard for the general examination has seven subjects. The percentage of importance is as follows: Party Doctrine accounts for 4 percent, Chinese 27, English 18, History 9, Geography 9, Arithmetic 22, and Nature 11. Performance review is divided into A, B, and C.</p>
<h3>A Small Chronicle of Preserved Eggs · Holding · Buddha</h3>
<p>Chicken eggs and duck eggs are nutritious foods, and Chinese people have many ways to eat them. The production method of preserved eggs is very much in line with chemical principles, and it is especially amazing to foreigners. The name of preserved eggs (transformed eggs) can be found in the Yancheng County Records, and (Songhua Cai Eggs) can be found in the Shuntian Prefecture Records. The method is to boil 100 eggs with four taels of strong tea leaves, filter the juice, add ten taels of edible salt, ten taels of unslaked lime (all finely ground), four liters of firewood ash, half a catty of glutinous sugar, three taels of alkali, mix them evenly into a ball, divide them into 100 balls, wrap each egg with one ball, put them in a jar, and seal the mouth of the jar tightly. It cannot be shaken. After forty days, it can be eaten. If you want the egg to have flower patterns, mix it with pine, cypress, and bamboo leaves and burn it into ash. You can also use a silver needle to vertically drill a hole and pour in a drop of shochu to make a sugar-yellow preserved egg, which is especially delicious and a good appetizer. According to Mr. Kondo's chemical analysis, fresh duck eggs contain 29 percent glucose, while preserved eggs contain none. The amount of non-coagulable nitrogen is higher in preserved eggs than in fresh duck eggs. The amount of fat in preserved eggs is reduced, but the amount of lipids is increased. The amount of lactic acid in preserved eggs is significantly increased. However, it is believed that preserved eggs still contain phosphorus, vitamin A, and ammonia nitrogen, which are very suitable for people with anemia and weakness. Compared with tea eggs, ash eggs, and lees eggs, they are even more valuable as an appetizer. Who would say that Chinese people cannot invent things? Ding's index is Jia 4, Yi 3, Bing 2, Ding 1, Wu 0. This is the standard for scoring. Students with a C grade can graduate, while those with a D grade must take a make-up exam. The papers will be graded by eight committee members and 45 specially invited experts. It is limited to three days after the exam is over. Miscellaneous reports In recent days, school authorities have flocked to the Bureau of Education to inquire about the test questions and grading. Several households are going through the motions. The staff and doormen of the bureau are very busy and call out (leg pain). The teachers and students are intensifying their work, running a special fast train to prevent falling behind. It is heard that two or three students in a certain school are suffering from trachoma and are asking the school doctor for treatment morning and evening in preparation for hugging the Buddha's feet. Those who know say that the school doctor is also implicated. At the time of the exam, the meal will be distributed by the bureau based on the certificate, and no private action will be allowed in order to save time and emphasize hygiene.</p>
<h3>Zhao Dingming's Wedding to Lang Lei Zhi</h3>
<p>Ms. Lei Peizhi leaped from the Hua Hotel to Mrs. Lang's starting June 8th. In advance, Mr. Lang Jingshan spent a lot of effort in preparing everything. After that day, they began their mutual assistance life. With Mr. Lang's sincerity and loyalty and Ms. Lei's gentleness and thoughtfulness, they will definitely be able to adapt to the environment and build an artistic model family. Having come from the barren district to find a new path in life, I was introduced by Mr. Huang Jingwan and met Mr. Lang. On that day, I was honored to be asked by Mr. Lang to help out. At the same time, what I heard and saw made me feel happy along with the guests. Thus, I naturally recorded the grand occasion of that day. On the evening of the 7th, it was still pouring rain. Who knew that the next day the clouds would clear, the sky would be clear, and the gentle breeze would be like a symbol of their bright future. The next day around ten o'clock, the male and female guests came in droves. In the grand, well-structured, and lush Hua Hotel, girls and girls, old men and old men, writers, painters, and photographers naturally gathered together according to their common interests, chatting or strolling in the garden, very happy. When the bride and groom arrived, everyone was overjoyed. Many famous photographers were busy taking pictures and movies. Mr. Zhou Shoujuan represented the guests in giving a congratulatory speech, saying (Jingshan is extremely still and thinks of moving. From now on, he will change to moving mountain. The love of the new couple is hot and will turn into a volcano). He also said, (We were afraid of thunder when we were young, and we still cannot avoid it when we are old. Now Jingshan has Lei as his wife. When the sound of thunder resounds, it shakes the mountains and valleys, so he will inevitably be afraid of his wife in the future). He also said (He</p>
<h3>South Seas Travelogue (27)</h3>
<p>On March 11th, I visited the Raffles Library and Museum. Raffles was the Englishman who created Singapore. The library was established in his memory. The library is not large, and there are black people and others among those reading magazines. Downstairs in the museum are displays of Malay indigenous crafts, thatched huts, and small boats. There was a woman placing a child on a bed and using an object to flatten the child's head. This is to mock their local customs. There are also beautifully woven fabrics worth seeing. There are also various musical instruments, quite similar to the three generations of musical instruments in our Confucian temples, suggesting that ancient cultures had points in common. Another artifact here that can be studied is a two-wheeled ox cart, only the wheels and the frame of the cart, perhaps the so-called "great carriage" originated from this simple form. I also saw it in Guangxi. Judging from the musical instruments and the simple form of the ox cart, it was probably during our Xia and Shang dynasties. The Malays also have their own writing system, and many of them now know English and dress in Western clothes. I saw an English book titled "The Malays of Malaya," written by a Malay. An interesting statement in it was, "I am writing this booklet because we are inherently a very small nation in the world." It also describes the loyalty and bravery of the Malays during the European war, who contributed 20,000 pounds to England, while the Indians resisted the English, whose troops were used to pacify the Malays, showing the Malays' trustworthiness. The conclusion is very sentimental, stating that after all, the East is the East, and the West is the West, and they cannot cooperate. Everyone has a love for their homeland, but we Malays are few and lack unity. Resentful but not angry, it can be seen that they are not truly convinced.</p>
<p>The upper floor of the library is quite impressive. Upon entering, there is a lifelike tiger, large elephant bones, several large snakes, some over forty feet long, some greenish, some earth-colored, some patterned, with frightening fur and bones. There are large poisonous snakes as thick as bowls, huge crabs measuring several feet across, many crows, and several kinds of birds of paradise, the so-called "fairy birds" (Bird of Paradise). There is a whale skeleton forty feet long, and a large crocodile also forty feet long. Moved by the greatness of the tropical natural scenery, my mind underwent a transformation, and I composed a poem:</p>
<p>Above, there is the vast sky, above, there is the great sun, large animals, elephant caves, sea monsters, large whales emerge, deep mountains, towering trees in empty valleys, large snakes escape, gazing at the ocean, lamenting the vast sea, hearing of the wondrously large Buddha (Hu Wenhu's newly built large Buddha statue), the tropics are truly free, all things are large and unparalleled, extracting essences that are abundant and grand, the primordial spirit is too unified, beyond the vast universe, one sees the Creator's brush. Therefore, Indian thought is so thorough, ninety-six great philosophers are all humbled before the Buddha, hundreds of rivers flow into the ocean, billions of stars surround the bright moon, emptiness if there is emptiness, the King of Emptiness, immortals, there should be immortal palaces. In the past, I roamed the vast wilderness of Mongolia, my thoughts galloped freely, now I see the magnificent beauty of the tropics, its momentum soars. In summer, all things grow, Heaven bestows vigor and strength, the South hangs images of life, revealing the civilization of nature, tracing humanity back to its origin, searching for the relics of Paradise, breathing the essence of the vast ocean, truly blending and harmonizing, vaguely the sea breeze blows, carrying me to the heavens, in the ten directions spiritual flowers bloom.</p>
<p>What moved me the most was the display of various guns, knives, swords, and sharp weapons. These weapons, compared to the killing machines of modern Europe, already belong to the past, but their sharpness is still enough to make one shudder. Although I have studied military affairs and personally engaged in warfare, because I study Buddhism, I immediately feel discomfort upon seeing these instruments of destruction. I said to Mr. Chen Huixiu, who was also visiting, "When can these various killing instruments be destroyed?" Mr. Chen replied, "Indeed, when Kun (earth) and Qian (heaven) are in harmony and peace prevails under heaven, it can be hoped that these instruments of human killing will be eliminated." I said, "Yes, but even then, there is no way to eliminate the instruments used by humans to kill animals. Our strength is truly limited." (The progress of their love was extremely fast, just like a sudden change in the weather, first came a burst of thunder, then a peal of thunder. Today, the yin and yang electricity have made contact with each other, so it must be cloud-forming and rain-making.) This evoked thunderous applause from the guests, especially the two newlyweds, who couldn't help but laugh with joy.</p>
<p>After the ceremony, everyone gathered on the steps in front of the magnificent building north of the pavilion. Mr. Qian Jinghua took a panoramic photograph with his Cirkut camera. Then many famous photographers from the Huaguang and Liangshe photography clubs rushed to take pictures one after another. After the photography, everyone went to the flower-filled, wine-soaked seats in the cool hall. The wedding feast began, with laughter and voices echoing each other, along with the sounds of waiters clearing knives, forks, glasses, and plates. The banquet ended at two o'clock in the afternoon, and the guests gradually dispersed.</p>
<p>In addition, there were two special features. First, the bridegroom's marriage certificate was prefaced by Mr. Zhu Yifang, and the certificate was painted in gold with dragons and phoenixes by Mr. Ye Qianyu, and set off by dark clouds by Mr. Zhang Guangyu, which was exceptionally beautiful. Second, among the stylish and prominent bridesmaids, such as Miss Zhang Yiru and Lei Peili, as well as other ladies, stood Miss Yang Jinxun and Qiu Fang, two female members of the Asian Walking Tour who were about to depart. Without makeup, they were strong and healthy, wearing light blue cloth shirts, black cloth skirts, and flat shoes. They were introduced by Mr. Huang Jingwan to various celebrities to promote the participation of women in national and social affairs and to awaken women's consciousness.</p>
<h3>European Correspondence (58) by Liu Haisu</h3>
<p>1929 Autumn Salon (Salon d'Automne 1929)</p>
<p>(2) The Greatness of the Autumn Salon</p>
<p>The grand occasion of last year's French Autumn Salon was truly a victory for the Autumn Salon. The atmosphere was truly solemn. I think that anyone who has seen the Autumn Salon will feel that kind of great life. After the Autumn Salon closed, I successively viewed the French Modern Exhibition, the Independent Exhibition, and the Winter Salon over the course of three months. Gradually, I felt the greatness of the Autumn Salon more and more. Recalling the Autumn Salon from the Independent Exhibition was already an incomparable matter. One day in mid-February, after leaving the Louvre and finishing a meal, Yunshi and I went to the Grand Palais to see the Winter Salon. We quickly walked around for a week, but we couldn't stop because it seemed as if everything we saw was uncomfortable. So we went out and strolled along the banks of the Seine River. I thought about the Independent Exhibition and the Winter Salon, saying that they could also be considered worthwhile art exhibitions in France, and they were also displayed in the majestic Grand Palais. How could they have become such a childish and mediocre collective? This was probably because I was used to seeing the Autumn Salon. How did the French Autumn Salon become such an authoritative institution? It has its own glorious history and unattainable power. Even the figures whose works were exhibited this time are already indelible masters in the history of modern art. This is not something I can blithely declare. People now and people in the future can touch their greatness in the true meaning of art.</p>
<p>These masters who have thoroughly understood the true meaning of life, perceive nature and touch the universal mysteries of nature, gaze at the universe and create their own world in a square inch. They bear the most outstanding and noble mission of mankind, creating truth, interpreting life and the universe. Such people are concentrated in the Autumn Salon, so the Autumn Salon has become the central hub of modern European art. It is probably no accident that the greatness of art is revealed from it. Moreover, the French Autumn Salon has actually become the world's Autumn Salon. In its atmosphere of vibrant inspiration, it can continuously produce great figures.</p>
<p>The representative figures of the Autumn Salon now are Henri Matisse, André Derain, Kees van Dongen, Maurice de Vlaminck, Pierre Bonnard, Albert Marquet, Charles Guérin, DEspagnot, Kisling, Camoin, Othon Friesz, Maurice Asselin, Félix Vallotton, and others. These people are all at the forefront of the 20th-century art scene. They each radiate their own brilliance and walk different paths, which is worthy of our praise.</p>

<h3>Speculative Gold Plummets</h3>
<p>Falling by 12 taels and 3 mace</p>
<p>Those who advance sharply retreat quickly</p>
<p>Huge waves reveal the current market conditions. Yesterday (Tuesday), speculative gold had already begun to drop sharply, almost resembling a storm. Spot goods gradually became plentiful, but exports were severely restricted. The Southern market was listless. Throughout the day, the fluctuations were as much as 20 taels, causing chaos. In the afternoon, the storm was even greater, with both official and unofficial exchange rates weakening. Banks were unwilling to buy, and traders' sentiments were unsettled, generally trending downwards. As for buying and selling, sellers predominated. Xingyu Dafuchang and others sold, while buyers were Yuanxiang and Yuyu, as well as retail investors. The market opened lower from the start, likely because silver prices rose repeatedly and future fluctuations were uncertain. Then, with the decline in exchange rates, it plummeted more than 10 taels. At noon, it was only 645 taels. Afterwards, buying interest was noticeably more active, but supply and demand were spontaneous, without any direction. As for the market price, it weakened to become firm, breaking the 60-tael mark. There was a 10-tael change, and the exchange rate loosened and then stabilized. Finally, it closed within 567 taels. The market conditions were extremely chaotic and difficult to predict.</p>
<p>The market opened lower by 5 taels and 5 mace. Yesterday, a telegram stated that silver prices had risen another eighth. Exchange rates remained the same. The July gold price opened lower by 5 taels and 5 mace, at 573 taels and 5 mace. Then, it fell from 77 taels to 45 taels. The telegram from the exchange had already lengthened to 25 US dollars plus 50 cents, while the Japanese rate decreased by 1.75 cents, and then it fell to 71 taels and 5 mace. Shortly after, it increased by 1 tael, 3 mace, and 4 candareens. Then, with even stronger selling pressure, it was heard that the swap spread would likely turn negative for the long position, because there was a lack of demand for cash. In an instant, it broke the 70-tael mark. Exchange rates for September US dollars at banks were 39 yuan and 375 cents. Mitsui sold August British gold at 7 pence for the first half, while the gold price fell sharply. The fluctuations were only two or three taels. After 11 o'clock, it was 64 taels. Afterwards, there were two or three taels of fluctuations until the market closed at noon at 65 taels.</p>
<p>The lowest price reached 56 taels and 6 mace in the afternoon.</p>
<p>At 63 taels, which was the remaining sentiment from noon. Afterwards, with an exchange rate that became increasingly stretched, and large firms like Zhifeng and Yongfuchang bravely selling, a storm arose in an instant, plunging by 7 or 8 taels. Guangdong offered August British gold at 7 pence 8125 cents, while the Oriental offered 875 cents, which was taken in by Sumitomo. Recently, Hefeng and Huabi mutually transacted at 7 pence 75 cents. Until after 3 o'clock, it finally fell to 56 taels and 6 mace. After entering, it slightly improved. Zhifeng and Yong and other large firms bought again, and the price rebounded to a peak, rising by more than 10 taels. After 4 o'clock, it was 67 taels and a half. The intensity of the change was inexplicable, truly due to the confusion of sentiment, ultimately controlled by the atmosphere. Afterwards, it weakened slightly by two taels. At 4:20, the market closed at 566 taels and 7 mace, a decrease of 12 taels and 3 mace compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>There was a fluctuation of 20 taels and 4 mace throughout the day. The maximum price in one day was 77 taels, and the minimum price was 56 taels and 6 mace, a difference of 20 taels and 4 mace. The afternoon premium was 65 taels in the morning and 67 taels in the afternoon. Accounts for June and July were settled at 65 taels. This month's exchange could be settled at 7 pence 375 cents. The Japanese rate was 1 tael, 2 mace, and 6 fen. The announced price had already been changed to 628 taels and 4 mace, a decrease of about 623 taels. The Japanese rate had already been listed as a decrease of 1.75 cents. In the afternoon, the announced price was still suppressed by about 60 taels. Goods opened at 74 taels in the morning, closed at 62 taels and 5 mace at noon, and closed at 66 taels and 8 mace in the afternoon.</p>
<p>There were more sell orders than buy orders in the market. Traders' transactions included Xiangyu Yuancheng, Yuanxing Yong, and retail investors, who all bought. Dadecheng and Yuanmao Yongyuan Taijingfeng Yong had inconsistent buying and selling. Wanxing Shunli had more selling than buying. Yuancheng Yongyifeng Yongfuchang Yuda Hengxing and others all sold. In the afternoon, Zhifeng Yongyuanmao Yonghengxing Xiangyu sometimes bought and sold, while Shunli and Wanxing Yuancheng Yuda all bought. Fuchang Taixing Yuanyuyong Shenchang Yong and Chunyuanyong all had selling orders. The Dalian gang's buying and selling were inconsistent, with each having more than 1,000 bars. The Guangdong gang sold about 2,000 bars, it was said.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rates Decline Officially and Unofficially</h3>
<p>Arbitrage Opportunities Nearing</p>
<p>Yesterday, official exchange rates were lengthened by one point, because there were no telegrams from the day before and silver prices had risen for two consecutive days. British gold increased by 25 cents to 1 shilling and 6 pence and 5 US dollars increased by 50 cents to 38 yuan. Indian increased by 1.5 yuan to 105 rupees. German increased by 2 yuan to 159 marks. French francs increased by 12 yuan to 967 yuan. Dutch increased by 1.25 yuan to 94 guilders. The Singapore rate remained at 148 taels. The Hong Kong rate remained at 83 taels. The Japanese rate decreased by 1.75 cents to 1 tael and 3 mace and 025 cents. The internal trend of banks also declined, weakening from the early morning and becoming even weaker at noon. In the afternoon, it turned from weak to level, truly due to the volatility of the gold market. It once broke the 560-tael mark and then rebounded to 667 taels. The confusion of the people's minds was difficult to grasp, but it still trended downwards compared to the end of last week. Since the official and unofficial exchange rates both declined, arbitrage opportunities were nearing. The Japanese rate was about 30 taels higher, and the British rate was more than 20 taels, which was about three-tenths less than last weekend.</p>
<p>A Chinese merchant speculated slightly, but there were no large transactions because gold prices fluctuated too much to act rashly. Transactions for British gold amounted to more than 200,000 pounds, with about 100,000 pounds settled. Mitsui and Guangdong sold, and the various banks mutually transacted 100,000 pounds. US dollar transactions were between 100,000 and 200,000 yuan. Few Chinese merchants sold, and Dalian sold hundreds of thousands of yuan of Japanese gold, which Mitsui and Sumitomo absorbed. They had previously settled hundreds of thousands of yuan of Japanese gold. The Joseon sold it. As a result, each exchange rate was compared with the end of last week (July 7), with British gold increasing by 5625 cents, US dollars increasing by 1 yuan and 1875 cents, and gold decreasing by too many points. The market sentiment had a hidden reactionary trend.</p>
<p>Internal British Exchange Rates:</p>
<p>Penny spreads ranged from 0625 to 125. The morning price was 1 shilling and 7 pence for the current month, 7 pence 0625 for July, 1875 for August, and 3125 for September. The buy price was increased by 0625. The noon close was 7 pence 375 cents for the current month and 6875 for September. The afternoon close was 7 pence 3215 cents for the current month, 375 for July, 7 pence 5 for August, and 625 for September. The buy price was increased by 0625.</p>
<p>Internal US Exchange Rates fluctuated by about 1 yuan, with spread of one and a quarter. In the morning, the current month was offered at 38 yuan and a half, 625 for July, 875 for August, and 39 yuan and 125 for September. The buy price was increased by 125. Zhejiang and Shanghai mutually transacted 50,000 yuan for September at a price of 39 yuan and 275 cents. The noon close was 39 yuan and 1875 cents for the current month, 3125 for July, 5625 for August, and 8125 for September. The afternoon close was 39 yuan and 125 cents for the current month, 25 for July, 5 for August, and 75 for September.</p>
<p>East Asian Exchange Rates rose and fell, with a difference of about 3 cents throughout the day, and a spread of half to seven-and-a-half cents. However, compared to the listed prices, it was reduced. In the early market, the current month was offered at 1 tael, 2 mace, and 85 cents, 8 fen for July, 7 fen 25 for August, and 6 fen 5 for September. The buy price was reduced by half. The noon close was 1 tael, 2 mace, and 6 cents for the current month, 5 fen 5 for July, 4 fen 75 for August, and 4 fen for September. The buy price was still reduced by five districts. The afternoon close was the same.</p>
<h3>Silver Squeeze Calms</h3>
<p>Interest Rates Rise by More than One Li, Silver Discount Plummets by 3 Mace and 9 Cents</p>
<p>Limited Bills of Exchange In and Out, Electronic Remittances Arrive from Various Ports</p>
<p>Market Overview: In the past few days, due to bank closures, funding was depleted and silver was extremely tight. Yesterday, the banks reopened and a large amount of electronic remittances arrived. However, money shops were making advances on the banks and discounting many bills, so silver funding suddenly became extremely loose, resembling the stable trend of last week. The short duration of this silver squeeze was entirely due to the effective maintenance of the authorities. The hoarders had no way to use their tricks. In summary, there were limited inflows and outflows of bills of exchange, and although silver funding was tight, there was no great danger.</p>
<p>Interest Discount Rates (Silver Cents): In the morning, because silver funding had loosened, the cent rate rose happily, closing better than the previous market by three hao and seven-and-a-half, at 7 qian, 1 fen, 5 li, 6 hao, 2 hu, and a half. In the afternoon market, it rose one li higher to 7 qian, 1 fen, 6 li, 6 hao, 2 hu, and a half. The situation could be expected to be peaceful and there would be no more strange changes. (Silver Discount) The early market was 2 qian and 6 fen, and the afternoon market was 2 qian and 1 fen, a sudden drop of 2 qian and 9 fen compared to the previous day. The markup premium opened at 1 qian and 89 fen and then became flooded and made a blank stroke. Afterwards, it was 56 fen. The bank's listed price was said to be 1 qian.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: Yesterday, the Jiangnan small dollar suddenly rose. In the early market, it was 6 qian, 3 fen, and 2 li, a sudden increase of 3 li compared to the previous market. In the afternoon market, it fell back 2 li to 6 qian, 3 fen. The volume of transactions was 4,000 jiao in the early market and 2,500 jiao in the afternoon market. The four-coin small dollar was 5 qian, 9 fen, and 4 li in the early market, a sudden drop of 2 and a half li compared to the early market of the previous day. In the afternoon market, it recovered by 375 hao to 5 qian, 9 fen, 4 li, 3 hao, and 7 hu, and a half. The volume of transactions was 180,000 jiao in the early market and 90,000 jiao in the early market. Copper coins were reduced from 500 wen to 408,000 wen.</p>
<p>Inflow and Outflow of Silver Dollars (Silver Funds): Yesterday, the banks released a large amount of funds, and there were also a large number of advances and bill holdings. Therefore, a large number of electronic remittances arrived from various ports, no less than 23 million. Therefore, the prime rate was abundant. Chinese merchants collected and remitted more than 2.9 million, foreign merchants more than 3.9 million, and various cargo remittances, tax miscellaneous advances, and other remittances collected more than 11 million. Warehousing was 500,000 and departures were 2.2 million. Japanese banks collected more than 6.4 million and departures were 400,000. The money shop silver public list collected a lot, amounting to more than 53 million due to the 10-day period. The markup collection was more than 7 million, and remittances from various routes collected more than 1.1 million. About 2 million in cash was collected. (Silver Funds) Early market bills of exchange were made at 1.71 million, and afternoon market at 1.59 million. Banknotes were 100,000 in the early market and no market in the afternoon. Outside market transactions were 147,000 in the early market and 85,000 in the afternoon. The banks mutually transacted 800,000 in the early market and 450,000 in the afternoon. The foreign accounts of each bank collected more than 1.4 million, and the foreign markup collection was more than 2.4 million. Silver advances were more than 3.2 million and banknote flows were more than 2 million. Money shop silver public lists collected a very large amount, totaling more than 11 million. Small money shop transactions were 670,000. Foreign currency from road users was more than 500,000. In terms of loading, there was more than 200,000 in cash and 100,000 in new currency.</p>
<h3>Securities Level, Bond Prices Decline From Highs</h3>
<p>Beiping: The opening price of the near-term Post-Reorganization Bond was 901, with a closing price of 651 for the near-term Customs Bond, 634 for the distant-term, 558 opening price for the near-term Disbandment Bond with a closing price of 55 and 555 for the distant-term. Cigarettes closed at 65296 for the near-term Bond at 154, with a distant-term price of 15475, with total sales of 260,000.

The near-term Disbandment Bond was 54296 and the spot price opened at 153, closing at 1525, with total sales of 215,000 (10th).</p>
<h3>Bond Market Declines Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were few spot transactions for public bonds, but there were still many futures. Bond prices initially opened with active buying interest and continued to strengthen. Subsequently, large firms suddenly sold large amounts, and those who profited from the market also closed out, so bond prices turned downwards and the trend was quite strong. Until the afternoon close, the downward trend had not weakened. As a result, except for the 7-year, 96, Continuing 25, and Financial bonds, which remained fixed, other bonds fell quite a bit. For example, Continuing Small Bonds, Post-Reorganization Bonds, Small Bonds, Eight-Nine Corners Bonds, and the entire Six Disbandment Customs Bond fell by about 1.5 yuan. The Disbandment Bonds fell by up to 2.5 yuan. The total volume of futures transactions for the day was more than 12.9 million yuan, and the volume of spot transactions was only 13,000 yuan. The bond-specific futures' opening and closing prices compared to the previous day's transaction volume were the entire six, June 6700 and 6650, down 140 20000.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Markets Gradually Entering a Downturn</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending downwards, with the situation becoming increasingly weak. This is because the overseas cotton market is sluggish, with a sharp decline. The domestic market is affected by strikes and actual sales are weak. People's minds are weak, and exchange rates are loose, and the premium is strong. In the afternoon, Ruida and Xincheng sold large batches of yarn, and the amount of bales was particularly large. The market was particularly soft, and the buyer's attitude was calm and there was still no intention to release. The sales of present yarn are slightly active in the Han gang. In short, the situation is not stable, the gold market rises and falls suddenly, and people's minds are still difficult to stabilize. The future of the yarn market is difficult to improve. Public tags Ruida and Xincheng sold large batches of futures yarn. The opening price of the early market was stable due to a stable gold market and there were no major changes in people's minds. The rises and falls were only one or two cents. In the afternoon, due to rumors, Ruida sold 3,300 bales and Xincheng sold 1,800 bales. With these two major firms selling, the situation naturally loosened and the situation changed, falling 6, 8 cents to 1 tael and 1 qian. The total turnover for the day was 17,800 bales. The closing prices of the public tag are recorded below: Public tag closing price rise and fall outstanding account volume September 1587 fell eight 19650. The June tag closing price 151 fell eight 21950 October 1590 920000 The July tag closing price 1561 fell eight 22750 November 1594 rose ten 8800 The August tag closing price 1578 rose ten 26400</p>
<p>The Han gang purchased about 1,000 bales of actual yarn, and the sales of actual yarn were still good. Each gang purchased futures and spot goods, totaling 1,840 bales. Among the colleagues, 380 bales were purchased. The market conditions were generally weak. Among the customer gangs, the Han gang purchased the most, with 955 bales. In addition, Sichuan purchased 50 bales, Niuzhuang purchased 250 bales, Changsha purchased 60 bales, Shantou purchased 40 bales, Nanyang purchased 130 bales, Luzhou purchased 50 bales, Qinhuangdao purchased 40 bales, the interior purchased 95 bales, Xuzhou purchased 50 bales, Guangdong purchased 40 bales, and miscellaneous gangs purchased 80 bales, it was said.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Tends to Soften Daily</h3>
<p>The cotton market is still weak because US cotton has fallen sharply, exchange rates are relatively loose, and people's minds are becoming weaker. In addition, the seller-side major firms are selling in the near term, so the situation is softening. Actual sales in the market are bleak, and a portion of people continue to add to their short positions. The market is particularly weak, but the inventory is thin and no new shorts have appeared enthusiastically. It is difficult to determine what will happen in the future. Public Tai and Ruida collectively sold more than 10,000 dan of futures cotton. The opening price of the early market was that although foreign cotton had fallen, the market price rose by 23 cents because the gold market had stabilized and retail investors were shorting. Later, because there were many sellers, it fell back. In addition, major firms sold, and each month fell by a small amount of five points. In the afternoon, Public Tai sold 6,000 dan and Ruida sold 4,900 dan. The buyers were all retail investors, and the market price was depressed and fell by 12 qian. The total turnover for the day was 47,900 dan. The closing prices of the Han tag are recorded below: Han tag closing price rise and fall outstanding account volume August 3730 fell two 565400 June 3630 fell two 55800 October 3670 1565100 July 3690 1070500 November 3660 47700</p>
<p>Actual sales are still weak. The cotton market is declining. The factories are still stagnant. The source is about 500 bales of Tonghua and 3,240 bales of Yaohua. The sale prices are recorded below. Shaanxi cotton was 3850. Puyi Factory purchased 600 pieces and sent them to the factory. Yaohua was 336 to 338. Weitong Factory purchased 500 bales and delivered them to the warehouse.</p>

<h3>May Cotton Yarn Exports Slightly Decreased</h3>
<p>May's Shanghai cotton yarn exports decreased compared to April. This is due to the passing of the peak demand season and the renewed instability in various regions. Statistics show exports of 76,326 bales, a decrease of 10,712 bales compared to April's 87,048 bales. Broken down by region: North China 21,963 bales, South China 31,628 bales, Yangtze River 19,154 bales, Foreign 3,581 bales.</p>
<h3>Grain Market, River Rice Prices Turn Upward</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the supply of inland rice arriving at Zhabei was scarce. Due to sluggish sales in recent days, some riverboats had diverted to other ports. As a result, customs clearance became smoother, and inland prices tightened, increasing costs. Therefore, prices rose by about a dime. Sales of previous-season japonica rice showed slight activity, also due to prolonged stagnation. Prices rose by nearly a dime. Arrivals and sales of thin indica rice were both cleared, and the market was stable. Yangdu superior rice remained quiet. Various types of Baiyuan rice arrived frequently, and the market price was reduced by another half-inch. Around the 10th, very weak sales of river-rice boats arriving from South Shanghai. Ordinary machine-milled japonica sales were not weak, so prices were firm. The path for tin-japonica rice wasn't good and there were no glories or disgraces in the overall market. Su Tong machine-milled japonica was always only used for village retail sales, transactions were not prosperous, and the price was stable, with ordinary qualities quoted at 19 yuan. Thin indica rice from Qingpu, Songjiang, and other areas in the southern route, due to the inability to expand sales areas, remained on the sidelines, so prices were still being reduced in batches. There was slight trading of early season rice, with ordinary Duzi superior rice quoted at 18 yuan by the local government. Sales of Customs-cleared rice were dull and few transactions happened and high-quality material found inquiries for special sales without any ups or downs. Secondary quality was overstocked and, with no buyers, prices continued to be weak. Sales of Yin Yuan rice were still acceptable and the weaving workshops were moving slightly with prices opening at around 17 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market, Sharp Rise Followed by a Major Fall</h3>
<p>In the afternoon, many took profits and exited positions, causing the market to plummet. Yesterday, the flour market showed a frenzied surge in the morning. The enthusiasm of the people seemed to be starting a new chapter. The highest price for this month reached 2 taels 5 mace 9 fen 7 li and a half, only 2 li and a half away from the 6 mace prediction. July reached 5 mace 4 fen 7 li and a half, August was flat at 4 fen 2 li and a half, September at 4 fen 7 li and a half, October 5 and a half, November 6 fen, up by as much as 3 to 4 fen compared to the previous day's closing price. This kind of spectacle was seen repeatedly during the peak harvest of new wheat, which was not only rare in previous years but also unprecedented since the start of trading. Afterwards, prices mostly fluctuated up and down slightly. Approaching the afternoon opening, due to many speculative longs seeing significant profits, they took advantage of the tense atmosphere to exit positions, forming an inverse proportion to the morning's surge, the after-surge requires an equal-sized fall. According to the factories, the lowest level is expected to be 5 qian 1 fen. If it lowers more than that, a rebound is still inevitable. As a result, this month fell back by 1 fen and a half compared to the previous day. July fell slightly by 7 li and a half, August fell slightly by 2 li and a half, September was unchanged, October was good by 1 li and a half, and November was good by 7 li and a half.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures, Big Rise, Small Fall</h3>
<p>Spot new wheat opened with over 8,000 bags. Yesterday, after the morning opening, wheat futures prices for all months rose in unison. The highest price for this month reached 4 taels 9 mace 2 fen, and July reached 8 qian 3 fen, up 9 fen from the previous day's closing price; August reached 4 taels 8 mace 5 fen, and September 9 qian, up 6 fen each; October 9 qian 4 fen, up 7 fen; November 9 qian 8 fen, up 5 fen. It can be seen that the frenzy in people's hearts at that time was beyond comprehension. By the afternoon opening, prices initially remained stable, but then a large number of floating longs returned, and there were also occasional sales from inland areas, causing the sharpness to slow down and slightly decline. However, if inland quotations do not fall significantly, there is no hope of recovery. As a result, this month rose by 4 fen compared to the previous day, July rose by 5 fen, August rose by 2 fen, September and October rose by 2 fen, and November rose by 1 fen. Current wheat, because the factory's appetite is still good, has been raised by 2 or 3 fen, compared to the arrival of new wheat. Jiading new wheat was seen to be surging: 4 taels 7 qian, 7 qian and a half, 7 qian. Penglai Zhen wheat was 4 taels 9 qian, 8 qian and a half, 8 qian, 7 qian and a half. Wusong wheat was 4 taels 7 qian and a half, 7 qian. Pu Qian 2 fen, 6 qian and a half. Baihegang wheat was 4 taels 7 qian and a half, 7 qian. Pudong wheat was 4 taels 6 qian 2 fen, 6 qian, 5 qian 8 fen, 5 qian, 4 qian. Dachang wheat was 4 taels 9 4 qian and a half, 4 qian. Chongming wheat was 4 taels 7 qian. Kunshan wheat was 4 taels 9 qian, 8 qian and a half, 8 qian. Over 8,000 bags were opened. Old wheat from Yaowan, Xuzhou, Qingjiangpu wheat opened at 2,000 bags at 5 taels 2 qian 1 fen, handled by Fuxin and Fufeng factories, etc.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods, Red Dates Recover After Extreme Weakness</h3>
<p>Since the price of red dates began to ease, sales prices have been extremely low. Recently, there has been a surge in momentum, a so-called major drop followed by a small rebound. Yesterday, 300 packages of Fu Red Dates opened at 6 taels 7 qian, up 7 qian from the previous day. Tian Qing Red opened at 8 taels 4 qian, also up 5 or 6 qian. The remaining Hao Red and Chicken Heart Red were out of stock, and the trend was quite tight.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Tunxi Zhenmei Has Slight Transactions</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Lu Zhuang Zhenmei, the market has been stagnant for a long time. Tea firms have adopted a cautious attitude towards future business. As a result, the price of inland rough tea is greater than that of Tunxi Zhenmei, which has already started sales at 116 taels. The Fushi Foreign Company has also made slight inquiries for Needle Eyebrow, Core Eyebrow and other items. Although the market cannot be considered optimistic, the sentiment has become slightly more stable. Qimen Black Tea's high-grade goods are still in demand, but supply cannot meet demand. Low-grade tea sales are not strong, and the market is showing a continued downward trend.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Chinese and Foreign Goods Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>The rising trend for this factory's cotton cloth has been very strong for days. Merchants are closely guarding their goods and not selling, so fine cloth and fine twill, spot goods are even more scarce. Various brands have risen by about 1 qian. Yesterday, Blue Flying Fish fine cloth sold for 7 taels 2 qian and a half, and Trumpet Brand Blue Double Fish, etc., were all 6 taels 9 qian 2 fen and a half. Yihuo bleached cloth, which had been stagnant for a long time, also suddenly surged. Yesterday, Golden Three Pagodas sold for 7 taels 7 qian and a half, and Cloud-Outer Floating Fragrance sold for 7 taels 9 qian and a half, an increase of 2 qian compared to the previous week. Group cloth is also strong. 9-11 pound cloth rose by 1 qian, 12-14 pound cloth rose by 7 fen and a half, and 16 pound cloth was unchanged. Coarse twill rose slightly and actual sales were strongest in this street. Sales of Shantou, Xiamen, Ningbo and other suppliers are also increasing. East Asian piece goods (East Goods), Bai Chou cloth and Yuan Yang yarn have the strongest rising momentum, opening at unprecedentedly high prices. In reality, as the sales season arrives, inventories are empty and sources are unsustainable, so the prices are surging sharply. Yesterday, Bai Chou cloth with a person and dog logo opened at 3 taels 4, a lavender leaf title strip at 3 taels 3 qian. Dian Qiuxiang cloth without foreign yarn was sold open at 8 taels 7 qian and a half, with merchants opening at 9 taels, Tang Taizong at 8 taels 6 qian and a half, Double Crow at 8 taels 4 qian and a half, and Zijin Mountain at 8 taels in the morning and selling open at 8 taels 1 qian in the afternoon. The market is very chaotic. The rising trend of Ziggurat flannel and Ziggurat satin has slowed slightly, while fine broadcloth continues to rise by 2 li and a half (West Goods). Since bleached cloth rose sharply, yesterday white hemp yarn also increased by 5 li, and washed hemp yarn was uniformly sold at 1 qian 9 fen.</p>
<h3>Metals, White Lead Sheet Prices Rise, But Actual Transactions Are Sluggish</h3>
<p>Since the price increase of white lead sheet, the demand from various suppliers has been weak and the market has been quiet. Although munitions factories, battery factories, tea suppliers, etc., have strong sales, they have also not made any orders recently. Although some businesses are trying hard to sell, it is also of no avail.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News, 200,000 Silver Dollars Loaded for Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Due to the Western holidays, there are no reports. American silver prices have increased by 1.25 to 3.6375. 1,300 pieces of cotton yarn, 650 bales of cotton.

<h3>The Author of Cyrano, Rostand</h3>
<p>In preparation for the Fudan Drama Society's performance of Rostand's Cyrano on the 10th of this month, we feel it is necessary to introduce this great romantic playwright.</p>
<p>We know that Rostand's France was during the era of Realist masters such as Alexandre Dumas, père, Beaumarchais, Flaubert, and Zola, as well as the naturalism of foreigners like Ibsen and Hauptmann, whose social problem plays filled the theater scene. Everyone was feeling a sense of endless fatigue. Therefore, Rostand's emergence, calling again for Romanticism, allowed the audience to once again immerse themselves in this intensely imaginative and rich nectar.</p>
<p>France has always been the birthplace of Classicism, and all traditional concepts and entrenched forces are solid. The thinking of graduating classes naturally leans towards the conservative side. Under these circumstances, it is certainly difficult to reform the conservative minds of the general public. It is remembered that after the birth of Victor Hugo's (Hernani), the Romantic movement gained considerable ground in France. Our Rostand, centuries later, with his heroic (Cyrano), rekindled the passion of Romanticism.</p>
<p>Originally, the greatest characteristic of Romanticism is passion, which is the depiction of humanity's inner life pouring and burning onto external objects. It does not, like Naturalism, specialize in reason and technique but leans towards idealization.</p>
<p>Understanding this, we can know that Rostand would never, like Flaubert or Beaumarchais, diligently search for and verify information when depicting characters in order to seek accuracy in narration. Instead, he would focus on yearning for beauty and freely express the author's own personal emotions.</p>
<p>At the same time, he was able to successfully transfer pure poetic thought into drama. He was able to disregard the fashion of the time and transfer this poetic thought, which everyone had already considered dead, into drama. Based on the fearless spirit of Romanticism, he resisted all corrupt forces, broke free from all restrictive disciplines, and allowed his emotions to run wild.</p>
<p>His play material usually expresses a lighthearted mood of love and adventure, making the reader feel adorable. However, we must finally know that Rostand is not as great as Shakespeare. We certainly cannot demand perfection. Some people say that Rostand is French, so he inevitably belongs to the decadent, pessimistic, and sickly and nothing else. Larlouse, the author of French modern literary history, also criticizes Cyrano for having many flaws, such as the chaotic interweaving of plot, the rough depiction of psychology, the clichéd verses, and the forced rhymes, etc.</p>
<p>Rostand was born in Marseille on April 1, 1868, and his father was a well-known local magazine journalist and economist. Rostand received his primary education in Marseille and then entered the Faculty of Law in Paris. However, the dry legal knowledge was far from satisfying the desires of our great genius, so he switched to studying literature.</p>
<p>Rostand's first play was a satirical comedy called (The Novelists), in three acts, which premiered at the Comédie-Française in May 1894. This play was known for its beautiful and refined satire. The following year, in 1895, he wrote (The Princess Lointaine) in four acts. In 1896, (Cyrano de Bergerac) was released, and Rostand's name spread to countries all over the world. Critics all recognized it as the greatest poetic drama since Victor Hugo's (Hernani). Therefore, this play was immediately translated into English, German, Russian, and other languages.</p>
<p>After this, Rostand wrote a six-act poetic drama called (L'Aiglon), which premiered at the Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt in 1900. It used a fresh style to write a satirical plot. This obvious style very brilliantly expresses his unique youthful and pleasant interest. In the middle, it describes in great detail a weak and poor little hero and all the decadent circumstances he encounters, making people feel that (Cyrano) is even more powerful. However, comparatively, it is not as significant as Cyrano.</p>
<p>When a genius publishes his greatest masterpiece, we and he himself will worry that he will not have such a play again, because we know that genius is only temporary. Sometimes his inspiration is like (a dream pen blooms), suddenly erupting and then not easily having this opportunity again. However, after reading (L'Aiglon), this worry can be put down.</p>
<p>In 1910, Rostand wrote another four-act play titled (Chantecler). This represents Rostand's philosophy of life. He used a rooster to express the fact that humans work hard for love in the world. The rooster is certainly not a remarkable thing, but its self-esteem is very high. It believes that the glorious sun every day is called out by its crowing, so it has fervent confidence in its own occupation and work. However, it later discovered that the sun could still come out as usual without its crowing, and it was extremely disappointed. Its usual beliefs were all destroyed, so it had to feel the sorrow of disillusionment. However, when it finally thought that it still had the rooster's love, it regained everything of the past. This unique depiction of love is certainly very moving.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be stated and end Rostand's life, that in 1902, Rostand was elected as a member of the French National Academy. Rostand died in 1918. (You)</p>
<h3>The Law School's Sports Day</h3>
<p>Although our school is not a sports major, nor is it the leader of sports in various universities at sea, our students still pay considerable attention to sports. As far as I know, there are organizations such as the Rose Basketball Team, etc. The school has required military training every morning, and you can hear the crisp and loud commands and the neat and quiet sounds of leather shoes on the playground at dawn. However, female students seem too quiet about sports.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, our school held a sports meeting as usual. The location was the Sincere Sports Ground. Many students participated, and there were more than fifteen or sixteen female students. The prizes prepared by the school, silver cups, silver shields, gold medals, silver medals, etc., were no less than ten kinds. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time. That morning, all the sisters in our room attended to watch. We thought it was early, but many students, the Dean of Academic Affairs, and other faculty and staff had arrived before us. I looked around the field but could not see a female athlete. It was just a group of valiant men! Male athletes seemed particularly energetic and eye-catching. At this time, although I respected the male students, I could not help but suspect the female students. Why did they sign up and receive their sportswear and shoes, but suddenly did not show up? There must be a reason.</p>
<p>It would have been fine if it was something else, but it made those of us who went to watch feel embarrassed. Many people said this: (Why didn't a female athlete come? Female students are embarrassed, it has something to do with your face. If they don't come, you should participate temporarily!) A few more students shouted (Welcome guests to participate!) In fact, they clearly recognized that we were students of this school, but deliberately said (Guests participate!), isn't this obviously laughing at us for standing by and being cowardly and incompetent? In this environment, we had no choice but to listen. But in my head, I can't help but deeply engrave the question of why those who had already signed up did not come to participate. Although under this helpless situation, I still secretly prayed that they could come in the afternoon, that would not be too late.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, because I listened to Dr. Lu's speech, which was invited by the Law Research Association of our school, I did not watch the sports meeting until the results of the general meeting were revealed the next day. I realized that the female students had never participated. How disappointed I was! I thought the women's team championship would be like the Far Eastern Football Championship, left to the next session. The overall first in the men's team was Huang Juying, known as Lonybelloa, and Chuan Shou, known as Hercules.</p>
<p>As for the female students' absence, I still couldn't resolve this doubt. Sure enough, I accidentally got real news. It is said that during the preparation period, students were asked to participate, and two registration books were divided, one for the men's group and the other for the women's group. Unexpectedly, a male student did not pay attention and mistakenly signed his name in the women's group's book. Because there were too many students in the whole school, the executive members of the preparatory committee did not distinguish who was a male student and who was a female student. Therefore, they mistakenly entered a male student into the women's group. They were completely unaware, but in the eyes of a group of female students, they thought that the preparatory committee was deliberately joking, so they stopped participating. In fact, it was simply a comical misunderstanding without any basis.</p>
<p>Because of this small misunderstanding, a male world was formed on the field, which is really a pity, but it can also be said to have left a comical page in the history of the Law School's sports meeting.</p>
<h3>Fudan Two Joint Entertainment Meetings</h3>
<p>At the end of each semester, there is usually a joint entertainment meeting (everyone is happy).</p>
<p>Therefore, on the 6th and 8th, there were two entertainment meetings at Fudan in Jiangwan at the same time.</p>
<p>One is the Business School's entertainment meeting.</p>
<p>(Hairpins and shadows, heaven and earth, what's the difference? Cars and horses flow, the wind is light and the moon is dim, only then do we know) This is what the editor of the school's fifth issue used to describe its grandeur. The most important programs are: (1) Ms. Huo Huizhen's Cantonese opera solo (2) Ms. Wo Min and Ms. Chen Yanshui's Spring Comes to Earth (3) Ms. Liu Xiaowo and Ms. Zhang Suzhen's Awakened Youth (4) Ms. Zhang Suzhen's Long Wish Song (5) Ms. Mao's Sailor Dance. It is not necessary to list them all, they are already a grand spectacle.</p>
<p>This is exactly what hot-blooded college students like, so cheers are endless.</p>
<p>The other is the Sociology Department's entertainment meeting (Drama, dancing, music, all have. Professors, students, school workers, all invited.) This is another description by the editor of the fifth issue. Let's take a look at the program: (1) Ms. Sun Fengshi and Ms. Zhou Xiufang's double act (2) Ms. Ji Wanyi and Ms. Cheng Yanfang's piano duet (3) Qiying Girls' School's Golden Bell Dance Dragon Tiger Fight, which is slightly more than the Business School's entertainment meeting, not to mention the three plays (4) Who is Crazy? one-act play (5) A Person Who Ran Away with Public Funds one-act play (6) The Final Disappointment comedy.</p>
<p>As a result, in lecture hall No. 101 of the Science Institute, no longer hearing the earnest teachings of professors, was filled with perverted applause. (Huiyin)</p>
<h3>Great Xia Wanbai Literary Society</h3>
<p>Farewell Party for Graduating Members Now the organizations of various societies or associations in various universities are indeed like spring bamboo shoots after the rain. Great Xia is of course no exception. It is learned that since the establishment of the Wanbai Literary Society in the school this spring, there have been more than fifty members. The organization is precise and the purpose is not only to understand each other and encourage each other in order to combine emotionally, but also rich in the spirit of research. Everyone encourages each other and wants to awaken (national consciousness) with the power of literature in an era of ideological chaos. Therefore, in addition to issuing a Wanbai magazine, there is also a soccer team organization to promote a strong physique. Recently, due to the upcoming summer vacation, ten members of the society are graduating from the school. In order to bid farewell to the graduating members and report on the society's affairs, the society held a farewell party for graduating members in the eighth classroom of Great Xia on the evening of the 7th of this month. More than fifty people attended. Zhong Ming at 7 o'clock, Xu Ze</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>June 11, 19th Year of the Republic of China (Shen Bao) Xiangjun was elected as the chairman of the conference, and Zhang Zhenyong was the recorder. First, Chairman Xu Zexiang reported the purpose of the meeting, saying that there were four more important purposes for today's farewell party for graduating society members: The first is that at the end of a semester, the society's affairs should gather all comrades together for a detailed report. The second point is that some members of the society are graduating from the school this semester. Everyone has always been like-minded and has been together for a long time. Once they separate, whether serving society or returning to the sea, they will have fewer days to see each other in the future. The psychology of parting is the same for everyone, so we must have today's conference to commemorate us. The third is that since the graduating students have expertise, whether they will dedicate themselves to society in the future or continue their studies, the society sincerely hopes that you will work hard for the country. The fourth point is that we are all diligently working hard all day long. There are very few opportunities to gather, and the floating life is also a guest in a foreign land, and we have encountered this day of parting, so we feel that today's entertainment meeting is worth commemorating. After Xu Zexiang reported on the meeting affairs, Zhang Yunxin, representing the society, delivered a farewell speech, and Wang Ruinian, Xie Shoufu, Wang Shushi, Fan Peiyuan and others delivered speeches in succession. Then, graduating members Tang Shiming, Li Xubin, Zhang Jingxin, Huang Qiren and others gave replies one after another, saying that they were very grateful for the kindness of the gentlemen, and that they would bravely move forward and work hard for the party and the country in order to fulfill the hope of the society. After that, more than twenty kinds of entertainment were performed for the rest of the fun, including two English songs by Cheng Chunlin, (Little Five Crutches) jointly performed by Xu Zexiang and Jiang Bin, a solo erhu performance by Zhang Yuanxin and Pan Le, a plate dance by Zhang Yuanhe and Li Zhi, a magic show by Wang Tinglin, and Peking opera sung by Zha Zongshan and others, followed by Kunqu opera by Ms. Zhang Yuanhe, a solo transverse flute by Wang Ruinian, a double act by Fan Peiyuan and Tong Shiquan, and a lama's speech. Finally, Li Zhi and Zhang Yunxin (new couple) had a social dance. The meeting was declared adjourned at 11 o'clock. (Villager)</p>
<h3>Law School Legal Research Society</h3>
<p>The Law School truly lives up to its reputation as a social science research institution. Everything from the school building's architecture and library facilities to the professors' dedicated teaching and the strictness of exams is remarkable. The midterm exams last month were overseen by the president, dean, and faculty members, along with the professors in charge. This time, for the holiday exams, an examination committee was further organized. Especially for the graduating students' exams, the seating is pre-numbered. All of this is clearly unmatched by the former Law University. Their rapid progress deserves considerable admiration. Consequently, the students are particularly interested, and they have spontaneously organized numerous academic groups outside of class, such as the Social Science Research Association, the Political Economy Research Association, and the Legal Research Association. Recently, a Legal Research Society was also established. Although it was established only two weeks ago, the executive committee and members are very enthusiastic. Everyone is committed to the research purpose and learning from each other. As a result, they published a journal ("Legal Light") yesterday, which is quite rich in content ("The Crisis and Remedies for China's Rural Economy," "Causes for the Increasing Number of Criminals in Contemporary Chinese Society," "My Views on the Labor Unemployment Introduction System," "Causes of Silver Price Decline, its Impact, and Remedies," "Women Should Abandon Extravagant Decorations," "How to Be a Writer," etc.). It was immediately distributed to all students and was well-received. According to the executive committee, they plan to publish another issue this semester. As the society was established very recently, the membership is not large. But given their accomplishments, a flourishing scene is expected next semester. Furthermore, the society recently invited Dr. Lu Jinhou to give a lecture on "Political Thought Revolution." I was fortunate enough to participate ("Listening to a lecture by a famous person is better than reading for ten years"). I feel like I took a special express train and read for ten years (Zhiyuan).</p>
<h3>New Voice Society of Central University</h3>
<p>Indeed, Central University has many literary societies and research associations, but apart from the Prometheus Society, which has a touch of romanticism, the New Voice Society is one of the most innocent. The New Voice Society is an academic organization spontaneously formed by some students of our school. It combines reason and emotion, adheres to the standpoint of the Three Principles of the People, and aims to research academics and publish journals. It was announced in February or March of last year, and its journal was born with a bang at the same time. I remember that when its journal was not yet published, it was published in the "New Voice" weekly supplement of the Central Daily News, specializing in elaborating the Three Principles of the People, researching construction plans, introducing and criticizing social thoughts and doctrines and political and economic creations of various countries, and literary works, which were very much appreciated by the general readers. But later, it thought, "Relying on others is not a long-term solution," so it independently changed to a bi-monthly publication and issued it independently. Now it has published more than thirty issues. (Xianrong)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Superiority of Lincoln Automobile Manufacturing</h3>
<p>Lincoln Motor Company officials declare that Lincoln cars produced by the Lingao Cold Plant can travel at top speed from the moment they are first driven, because their machines and good work reduce friction on all parts to a minimum. When a car is first driven, it is important to adjust the operation of each part so that all slides can be placed in the proper position. If each part is not adjusted properly and driven at top speed, it will not only cause the machine to overheat and the sliding area to be damaged. Lincoln Cold Plant cars have reached perfection in their operation after final inspection and do not require further adjustment. Therefore, whether it is the first mile or the thousandth mile, it can be driven at top speed. The crankshaft in the car is manufactured to perfection, and the sliding area varies by less than one five-thousandth of an inch. The joint between the connecting rod and the sliding area cannot be determined by sight. The installation is able to distribute the oil from the hollow crankshaft very thinly to reduce friction to a minimum. After the shaft is installed on the slide, it can be moved at any time by pressing a thumb on it. The weight difference between each set of connecting rods and piston assembly is only a small fraction of an ounce, so it can reduce vibration and eliminate loss. The cylinder is manufactured in the same way as the crankshaft. After drilling, it is polished one at a time, so it is very perfect. Even the most accurate instrument can measure the difference by only the smallest fraction of an inch per inch. All four cylinders could be brushed at the same time, but after research, it is known that rubbing one by one is more effective. After brushing, use fine stone to wipe it clean to form a mirror surface. Whether the gear device in the car is appropriate has a great relationship with the life of the car, so it must be meshed accurately. If there are some small problems, it must be discarded. After the manufacturing and inspection are completed, an electric needle is used to mark it for easy verification.) The manufacturing process of automobiles is carefully inspected at all levels from raw materials to finished vehicles. Sometimes each inspection is inspected several times to ensure that the produced automobiles reach the best level. Each car is inspected as many as 30,000 times. General Motors Corporation</p>
<h3>Hope for China A</h3>
<p>Mr. Klish, the Shanghai sales director of the American General Motors China Branch, recently spoke to people about the purpose of establishing a branch. His words were all related to China's future. The following is a transcript: Mr. Klish said that the American General Motors Manufacturing Corporation has recently realized that after China's unification, the development of transportation in the future will be unlimited. General Motors is the only tool to help China's transportation. Therefore, it has specially set up a China branch to actively carry out operations in China. Today, the importance of roads in China is noted by everyone from the government to the people, because the development of transportation is closely related to China's prosperity and prosperity, and the country's security and unification are also related to it. The Chinese government deeply knows the benefits of transportation to the country and the people. On the one hand, it plans to build railways, and on the other hand, it advocates the construction of roads throughout the country, and the people are even more enthusiastic to participate in the road construction movement. Once roads are accessible in all directions, the future of the automobile industry is very promising, because the best tool for transportation is the automobile, and General Motors is especially needed by China. China's heavy use of automobiles will make General Motors' hopes in China great and unparalleled. General Motors' strong capital and numerous products are giants in the automobile industry, and its internal organizational spirit of continuous progress is even more rare. At this point, Mr. Ke briefly elaborated on the history of General Motors. According to General Motors, it has been more than 20 years since its founding. The initial capital was only 10 million US dollars. It merged the Buick</p>
<h3>Cars for transporting horses</h3>
<p>General Motors trucks have a large wheelbase and strong load-bearing capacity. The body can be equipped to load various livestock and goods. The picture on the left shows a large General Motors truck with a specially equipped body for transporting tall thoroughbred racehorses. The car can carry four horses very comfortably, and even if there are more than ten, it will not be too crowded. (Ji) Osborne Beryl and Cadillac Three automobile factories merged and now the capital has been increased to 4 billion US dollars. There are more than 12 kinds of cars. The export trade value in 1928 was 28 million US dollars. General Motors cars are sold all over the world. There are already 114 countries with General Motors cars. There are more than 6,000 General Motors buses and trucks in China. More than 1,500 General Motors vehicles were imported from January to June this year. The General Motors cars most suitable for China are the new Chevrolets. The price is low, the cost is saved, and it is suitable for sales in the interior. The new Chevrolet has six cylinders, but the price is no different from a four-cylinder car. The engine is also new, strong and powerful, and runs smoothly and quickly. It saves fuel and can travel more than 20 miles per gallon. Therefore, the new Chevrolet is welcomed all over the world. In total, more than 500,000 Chevrolet buses and trucks have been manufactured and distributed to various countries around the world from January to August this year. In addition to setting up many factories in the United States, General Motors has also established assembly plants and branches all over the world to implement global services and make General Motors cars available everywhere. At present, there are 24 General Motors factories abroad. Recently, it has merged the German Weber Automobile Factory and also set up a branch in China at the same time. General Motors' China branch has two offices, one in Shanghai and one in Shenyang. The Shanghai office manages central China, and the Shenyang office pays attention to the business of North China, the three northeastern provinces, and Outer Mongolia. Although General Motors does not deal directly with customers, it is managed by managers and regions. However, the service scope of its branches is quite broad, and the responsibilities are extremely important. For example, the branch must set up a warehouse to store various vehicles to meet the needs of the society and avoid the delay of ordering directly from the US head office each time. The branch must always store parts worth tens of thousands of yuan. The parts are needed more because the roads in China are not good. It is more convenient for General Motors customers to purchase and replace. The branch must also set up a complete service department and hire experts to serve as professors, craftsmen, and mechanical knowledge. This is the General Motors service training school, which will be opened in Shanghai on November 18. This department also provides the most effective organizational repair stations for managers in various places. All the actions are solely for the sake of General Motors customers, and the purpose is not only to sell cars, but also to allow customers to use General Motors</p>

<p>(Shanghai Newspaper Supplement) Wednesday (11) During the automobile period, enjoy all the latest benefits. From this, it can be seen that General Motors has invested a lot in setting up a branch, and now that it is actively operating in China, General Motors has great faith in China's future progress.</p>
<h3>Williams Overland Passenger and Cargo Vehicles</h3>
<p>Forlan The Williams Overland Automobile Company in 1930 has made great contributions to the automobile market. The company produces as many as four major categories of passenger cars, and the trucks are suitable for all purposes and are extremely wonderful. Agents all over the world who sell various vehicles of Williams Overland Company occupy an important position in the automobile industry and are valued by people, that is, because of this. As for the repair stations scattered all over the world like spider webs, their strict organization and considerate and agile service are even more famous and praised by people. Williams Company contributes to the automobile market with these characteristics, no wonder its business is developing rapidly and growing rapidly. According to the fine quality of automobiles, the improved Williams Knight Big Six car of Williams Overland Company is truly the best of the best among automobiles. All kinds of styles and colors are available. As for the mechanical engineering aspects, they are all improved and perfect. All the necessary new equipment and devices are excellent and unparalleled. In addition, the Williams Knight 70｜B new car is the most popular among medium-priced cars. The sleeve valve engine is famous for its full power and great efficiency. Now, this engine has been specially improved to be more solid and durable. If we talk about low-priced cars, then the Williams six-cylinder car of the company is indeed the best in the industry. This new car is equipped with a high-speed engine with 65 horsepower, high speed is 70 miles per hour, and low speed is 45 miles per hour. The canopy is complete, and the beauty of the style, the vividness of the colors, and the perfection of the decoration and equipment are the same for all cars. As for the Whitbet four-cylinder car, it is known for its stability and reliability. It is the most excellent among the lowest-priced cars. Williams Overland Automobile Company not only makes great progress in the manufacture of passenger cars, but also concentrates on the manufacture of commercial vehicles. Its achievements have never been seen before. Its products, such as the William six-cylinder new freight car and the 1.5-ton new freight car equipped with the William Knight sleeve valve engine, are all necessary tools for the development of commerce, and their economical and affordable prices can give purchasers great benefits. There are two types of light trucks with a load of half a ton: four-cylinder and six-cylinder. Medium trucks include the Williams six-cylinder and the T｜I03 Williams Knight new car. In addition, there are heavy Williams Knight trucks and those with a load of 2.5 tons, etc. In addition to the various vehicles mentioned above, there are also commercial sedans and commercial sports cars, which are specially for salesmen to ride. Both sedan and convertible bodies can be installed at will, which is very convenient. Six-cylinder lightweight</p>
<h3>Small Car Research by Lin</h3>
<p>Superior to Four-Cylinder Models: Currently, European and American automobile manufacturers overwhelmingly favor multiple cylinders in their car engines. The trend of eight-cylinder cars is indicative of this. In America, only one or two manufacturers still produce four-cylinder engine cars; Ford being a notable example. The popularity of lightweight small cars is also gaining momentum. For instance, the (PePe Austin) is recently being manufactured and sold extensively in the United States. The six-cylinder lightweight cars produced in England are also emerging one after another, which can be said to be a new trend in the automotive industry.</p>
<p>Small cars with seven or eight cylinders and low carriages are purely British products. Their popularity has attracted attention and exploration from people in the automotive industry. Among them, the most popular and well-received are the six-cylinder lightweight cars, which have replaced the four-cylinder models of the past. The issue of these so-called six-cylinder small cars is quite interesting to study. Given time, these extremely small six-cylinder cars will surely surpass their peers. Although currently, various difficulties prevent them from achieving immediate success, small six-cylinder cars are not a new invention. However, they are often sports cars or other types that are difficult to classify as small cars due to their body size. The truly small cars are not those with large bodies but with six cylinders. Instead, their bodies must be small, with more cylinders, so that they are more stable on the road and more fuel-efficient. The popularity of the above-mentioned small cars among customers is self-evident. However, customers should not expect a 50% increase in speed simply because two cylinders have been added compared to a four-cylinder car.</p>
<p>The most significant difficulty in manufacturing the aforementioned small cars is the efficiency of the engine. In terms of single-cylinder efficiency, a six-cylinder engine is actually less efficient than a four-cylinder engine, referring to cars of the same size. This is due to the greater loss of heat and friction in six-cylinder engines. Furthermore, it is difficult to distribute the same amount and quality of gas evenly among the cylinders of a six-cylinder engine. The smaller the car and its capacity, the greater this difficulty becomes. However, the driving experience and torque rate of a six-cylinder car are more comfortable than those of a four-cylinder car, a fact not widely known.</p>
<h3>Listen! The Engine's Rumble</h3>
<p>The illustration shows an animal in the Los Angeles Zoo standing on the running board of a Chrysler (70) sports car, listening intently to the engine's rumble, as if it were an engineer studying it.</p>
<p>Its six-cylinder engine increases speed faster than a four-cylinder engine. Also, due to the reduction in static force, the rotational force also increases. However, there seems to be less improvement in fuel economy. Furthermore, a six-cylinder engine without perfect gas distribution is not ideal and requires another method to distribute the gas mixture into the cylinders, almost adopting a mass-loading approach. For maximum power, the highest rotational force can be used, leading to a trend of using large six-cylinder or eight-cylinder engines.</p>
<p>Initially, it seemed appealing to simply add two cylinders and an engine block to an existing four-cylinder design for small six-cylinder cars. Extending the wheelbase to accommodate the longer engine and then fitting a body similar to that of a four-cylinder car was even more enticing. However, the resulting car's speed increase over a four-cylinder car is limited, only offering a more comfortable and stable driving experience. In essence, replacing a four-cylinder engine with a six-cylinder engine results in a 50% increase in heat loss and a 50% increase in mechanical friction. Therefore, without increasing the rotational force, the horsepower will definitely not increase by 50%. Increasing the rotational speed requires enlarging the intake manifold and carburetor, which is difficult without sacrificing fuel efficiency. However, buyers of six-cylinder cars expect an increase in speed, not a decrease. With these concerns, we see that while the car's weight increases, the horsepower increases only slightly, thus limiting the car's speed and comfort.</p>
<p>Therefore, the final development trend will likely involve changing the size of the four-cylinder to six, but the engine must have higher efficiency than currently used. This method involves increasing the loading capacity. This suggestion is based on recent knowledge, and no one can say that reforming the current situation is impossible. These improvements are urgently needed, and the key lies in gas distribution. A more efficient engine may not be perfect in terms of fuel consumption, but these details can be resolved, although manufacturing costs will be higher. It is quite interesting to discuss the modification of small cars into (lightweight six-cylinder) models because the engine and wheelbase must be lengthened, increasing the space between the radiator and fenders by about five or six inches. The significance of this shape change, with the body remaining unchanged, is self-evident.</p>
<p>From an observer's perspective, the following predictions can be made regarding its road performance: First, although the wheelbase extension is minimal, it greatly affects the suspension's travel, improving stability. Second, due to the increased engine power, lower gears can be used, increasing the acceleration force of the top gear, making driving more convenient. As for the selling price, it will not increase significantly compared to existing four-cylinder models with the same body. Furthermore, because the added two cylinders are the same as the original four cylinders, the same pistons, connecting rods, valves, etc., can still be used.</p>
<h3>Shun Fung Brand Vehicle: Precision and Accuracy by Chu Zish</h3>
<p>Items as small as one thirty-secondth of an inch are perhaps visible to the naked eye, but anything smaller is beyond the capabilities of human sight. Now, imagine dividing a line that is only one sixtieth of an inch long into sixty-two equal parts. Each of these parts would only be one thousandth of an inch long. If each of these equal parts were further divided into two, their length could only be expressed as a decimal, about 0.0005 inches. How meticulous is that?</p>
<p>Shun Fung brand vehicles are known for being the most distinguished and valuable among low-priced cars. This is the general consensus within the automotive industry. The Chrysler Company, which manufactures these cars, has the same objective. It has often been asked why Shun Fung brand vehicles have such a prestigious reputation. It's because their structure is so meticulously designed that no ordinary low-priced car can hope to compare. The precise manufacturing range of various parts and areas on the car is countless. From this alone, their precision and accuracy can be seen. In addition, considerations for stability, comfort, economy, and longevity are all taken into account and handled with the utmost care. In this regard, their manufacturing is not much different from high-priced cars. Shun Fung brand vehicles have the advantages of high-priced cars but are sold at surprisingly low prices. Therefore, it is no wonder that they are popular everywhere and their sales are skyrocketing. News.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Province Road Building Campaign by Fan</h3>
<p>Since the success of the revolution, the reconstruction era has begun. Various provinces have been putting in all their efforts for the planning and implementation of road construction for automobiles, with the hope of developing transportation to benefit the public. Among all provinces, Zhejiang Province has been progressing with the construction of roads particularly rapidly and with the most notable achievements.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau's road network plan for the entire province includes ten main lines. The main lines connecting Hangzhou with various locations are called meridian lines, totaling six. The main lines connecting the meridian lines are called latitude lines, totaling three. The main line connecting various coastal areas is called the coastal line, totaling one. In addition, all secondary roads are called branch lines, totaling thirty-eight. The main lines are 4,852 li in length, the branch lines are 6,614 li, totaling 11,466 li. Currently, over 3,000 li have been completed. Although this is less than one-third of the planned routes, in our country during the budding era of construction, the achievements of road construction in one province like this are not easy.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau is actively planning and carrying out road construction while also making efforts to promote public awareness of the benefits of road construction so as to avoid obstruction. Many hands make light work; it is difficult to clap with one hand. Since the authorities are leading the way and the public is also helping, success will naturally be swift. The slogans and promotional songs for Zhejiang road construction are recorded below.</p>
<p>(1) Slogans</p>
<p>Repairing roads to benefit the people's travel is the primary goal recognized by Premier Sun Yat-sen for construction.</p>
<p>Business and industry cannot develop without road construction. To save time and money, one must use long-distance buses. Road construction and automobile travel are better than repairing bridges and roads. Automobiles are traveling angels. Riding in a car is like shrinking the earth. Using human and animal power for transportation is not as good as using mechanical power. Automobiles are ethical.</p>
<p>Song for Road Promotion Melody 4/4 C</p>
<p>135-|54321-| Building roads makes travel convenient. 2275|5531| Developing commerce and industry saves time. 12345-|54321-| I advise you to take the car, it's fast and saves money. Miscellaneous</p>
