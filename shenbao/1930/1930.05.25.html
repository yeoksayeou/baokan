<h3 id="c3">奥之棒喝黨與社會黨 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>奥國棒喝黨圖奪政權。反對政府解除政治團體之武裝。意在與社會黨挑戰。今其議雖巳經奥國會否决。然棒喝黨之在奥政黨。中確占有勢力之一部分。否决之後。第二步將有何種方法。以進攻社會黨。而社會黨之所謂鎭靜以待者。又將有何種手段以應戰。此誠大可注意之問題也竊謂奥之左右两黨爭權。與歐洲全局。亦有重大之關係焉。蓋歐洲自大戰以後。政局上發生一極大衝突之現象。一方面民治主義勃興。發生許多共和國。一方面獨裁政治日盛。又生出許多狄克推多。一方面思想日趨於新於左。一方面又日趨於右。而世之論此現象者。僉謂自獨裁政治興。議會制度。日漸崩潰。共和之聲日即於銷沉非特君主立憲國。每將憲法摧殘。即共和亦有徒擁虚名者。故皆視此種現象。爲民主政治之危機然吾人就實際言之今日獨裁之國雖皆似意氣發皇。政權鞏固。然其所恃者。不過一二人之才能權力。操縱得法。始如此之成績。若其人旣去。敗壞隨之矣。至民治主義以多數人爲基礎。而不以一二人爲轉移。今者民治主義。愈闡愈精。推行亦必愈廣。决非此無根發展之獨裁所能抵抗也。</p>
<p>歐洲新舊两派消長之情勢如是。一國之内。亦何獨不然。奥之棒喝黨。今日縱能戰勝社會黨。奪得政權縱再進而能如意國棒喝黨之强固。然亦僅爲一時的奮興。而終必掩沒於潮流之下。則可斷言者也。</p>

<p>鄰人郁姓子。性極魯鈍。人咸呼之爲笨牛。渠亦有時噭然應。習工爲賈。均不能畢其業。於民十三赴粤依其叔。在粤不一月。以失踪聞。至今六七載。四出探尋。一無朕兆。僉謂其必死多活少也。豈知月前。而此失跡之笨牛。巳施施然歸其家。人咸驚異。亟詢其踪跡。據牛云。在粤中伊叔處。無所事事。日惟　亍街衢中。一日在漿欄街遇一人。衣服都麗。舉止闊綽。見其閑行街頭。以探問路徑爲由。互展姓氏。以及邦族旅居無一遺。牛亦不假思索。一一告之。此人自云姓錢名在東。現在某輪上爲買辦。手下用役甚衆。牛正在不得志而思謀事。不顧利害。盡情相託。錢允即爲其在輪上安插位置。每月辛工若干金。惟云因此等機會。謀之者衆。故在他人前。切勿露風。免被捷足者先登。牛謹諾。相約隔日在某茶肆中再叙而别。牛如約往。而錢某巳先在。云事巳成。惟此輪今日急於駛行。如欲就此業。不妨此時偕同登輪。一切行裝。到輪後當可代辦。牛大喜過望。以謂叔季之世。遇此好人。眞是難得。心中之感激。莫可名狀。乃偕錢登一巨舶。錢囑牛蟄居艙下。不許出。逾時纜解輪駛。牛遍覓錢某不得。未免忐忑。飯時由輪役呼之食。輪行一晝夜。抵一孤島。由役驅牛登岸。牛思辨詢。見岸上有似工人者五六人。挾牛而入一礦洞中。雖狂呼極喊。一無援者。從此暗無天日。而作牛馬之生活。監督者極嚴酷。稍憩則鞭撻隨施。苦不堪言。思逃。復無出路可尋。自以謂必將死此礦中矣。不料去年礦中正在施工之際。礦石爆裂。全礦盡毁。工人中死傷十之八九。而牛則祇受微傷。礦爆之後越四五日。有巨輪來島。渡未死之工人去。牛亦在其中。迨輪至香港登岸。雖仍有人監督。牛乘其不備。負傷忍痛而逸。乃沿途求乞至粤。至伊叔處。給資使其還鄉云云。言下猶有驚悸之色。余素聞粤地有販賣猪仔之黨。牛所遇者。殆即此乎。揭記之。告入粤之青年。</p>

<p>威尼斯商人劇中之第二幕</p>
<h3 id="c260">觀威尼斯商人後·鄭·鏞 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>渴望了好久的威尼斯商人終於十七日公演了</p>
<p>這次戲劇協社公演威尼斯商人、巳有幾月的籌備、在極長的劇幕之中、有三十數人之多的演員、可謂排演及演員人數上不能不說是有感困難的地方、這次公演下來的結果、於舞台上的表演、書册中的情節、還差不多、演員却也還有純熟的成績、這是使人極佩服而且是不能不說很進步的、</p>
<p>在威尼斯商人的全劇中、是分爲五幕、這五幕裏的主要角色、是濮茜亞白山奴安東尼夏勞克及其女夏惜凱、這每個主角的身分、各個人的性格、對話時所發的聲音、並其流露出來的歡情與悲愁的態度、要能各得其宜、不使有一人稍欠差池、這樣終能夠把整個的威尼斯商人從劇本子裏把牠搬移在舞台上來活靈靈的表現、雖然這幾個人之中、所飾的演員還過得去、但是比較能給觀衆印象深刻的、還是要算沈潼君飾的夏勞克、十足的流現出他老奸巨滑的酷殘、使别人倒運而反倒運到他自己頭上來的晦氣、但是夏勞克在當他的女兒夏惜凱私　跑後、他遍處去搜尋而未找着的那種急荒的表情、不宜過於太忙和急噪、至其呼喚他女兒的聲音應含蓄悲宛與喘不過氣來的神氣、又夏勞克在第四幕第一塲中威尼斯法庭上對審問官那種屈强惡毒的態度、表示他滿腹濁氣、而要宣洩他内心的恨、惟一的就是報復和安東尼、要去割一磅肉底姿勢與其顫動的語言、却很爲神活、這可說是在全劇中最出色的地方、</p>
<p>飾安東尼的黄一美君、還能表現得像一個商人性質底白山奴的忠誠友人、不過舉動上較爲遲板一點、但於劇情上並不十分遜色、</p>
<p>濮茜亞姑娘美麗的丰姿、在虞岫雲</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>中華民國十九年五月二十五日（申報本埠增刋）星期日（六）</p>
<p>女士伶俐的身才、晰白的面貌、與極清秀的話音、甚爲合當、其嬝娜的姿勢而帶莊靜的貴女豐容、這是使觀衆特别注神的稱讚的、虞女士實爲該劇中適合而不可缺少的一位重要底角色、</p>
<p>關於佈景方面、太於耗費了寳貴的時間、蓋以佈景過遲緩了、有使觀衆不能持久的嚴守着肅靜的忍性、使觀者波動起談話的聲音來、致使演塲中頓將沉默的空氣破壞、或者有些無味的任意的咳嗽和吐痰聲、（假如啓幕得快、自然就少有這種現象了、）至第二幕的濮茜亞的家裏一塲、佈置得不大好、就會變化成大世界裏的文明戲似的、　句話說、就是在濮茜亞的家中陳設自然要富麗、然而却不可過於近俗、或者竟至弄得太糟糕、｜因爲太顧寫實的原故、就繁復而不雅了、　　全劇的末尾一塲、濮茜亞家的花園中、佈設的景緻尙稱合宜、所置的蒙綠蔭林、實爲臺上不容易弄得好的、惟惜其燈光所帶的彩色過重、綠得不像夜間的皎白銀光、這點似乎應宜用藍色、而色素取淡些、這雖然是極微小的事情、我爲求全責備起見、也顧不得吹毛求疵了吧、但在前幾幕的光影、不能不說是極妥當的、　　還有一點事、是很滿意的、就是這次觀衆當中大家都非常的能夠嚴守秩序、比在平常的劇社中公演爲不可多得的雅靜、似乎舞臺上的藝術技巧很能激刺觀衆的腦子的、</p>
<p>威尼斯商人劇中之第四幕</p>
<h3 id="c261">光華女生的體育 <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>光華女生的體育、是十分幼稚、因爲自從招收女生以來、爲日甚少、各項設施、尙未十分完備、大多數女生、每日除上課外、都是裝飾整齊、在操塲和馬路上散步、毫無一點運動的成績、常此以往、實在有負女生的渴望、學校當局、有鑒於此、乃闢東北一隅、作女生運動塲、請體育家某女士爲敎授、最近組織排球隊、請定中學某敎員作指導、每日清晨、輒見「紅領隊」英雄十數、雄糾糾氣昻昻往來操場、這也許是光華女生體育的發軔、</p>
<p>不過有一件事、最能阻碍她們體育發展的、就是每逢女生體操、男生便像潮湧的一般環作數層作壁上觀、「好」嘸啥好、大聲喊叫、「她的頭髮燙的太鬆」、「她是個八字脚」、批評得可謂「無微不至」、閙得女生有點怪難爲情的、都怕上體育、致有許多人不上課、所幸體育部巳將女生操塲、用籬牆圈起、祗留出入小門一、聞其用意有二、一曰杜防男生觀賞、二曰努力練習體育云、（四）</p>

<h3 id="e3">The Austrian Heimwehr and the Socialist Party <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The Austrian Heimwehr attempts to seize power, opposing the government's disarmament of political groups, intending to challenge the Socialist Party. Although their proposal has been rejected by the Austrian parliament, the Heimwehr does hold a portion of influence among Austrian political parties. After the rejection, what methods will they use to attack the Socialist Party? And what means will the Socialist Party, which is said to be calmly awaiting the situation, use to respond? This is truly a noteworthy issue. It is believed that the power struggle between the left and right parties in Austria is also of great significance to the overall situation in Europe. Since the Great War, an extremely conflicting phenomenon has occurred in the political situation in Europe. On the one hand, democratic governance has flourished, giving rise to many republics. On the other hand, autocratic politics have become increasingly prevalent, giving rise to many dictators. On the one hand, thought is becoming increasingly new and left-leaning, and on the other hand, it is also becoming increasingly right-leaning. Those who discuss this phenomenon all believe that with the rise of autocratic politics, the parliamentary system is gradually collapsing, and the voice of republicanism is fading. Not only are constitutional monarchies constantly destroying the constitution, but even republics have merely empty names. Therefore, all view this phenomenon as a crisis of democratic politics. However, from a practical perspective, although the autocratic countries of today all seem vigorous and their political power is consolidated, they rely on the talent and power of one or two individuals to manipulate effectively to achieve such results. If those people are gone, then ruin will follow. Democratic governance, on the other hand, is based on the majority and does not shift with one or two individuals. Today, democratic governance is becoming more and more refined, and its implementation will inevitably become more widespread. It is definitely not something that rootless and developing autocracy can resist.</p>
<p>The situation of the rise and fall of the old and new factions in Europe is such, and it is no different within a single country. Even if the Austrian Heimwehr can defeat the Socialist Party today and seize political power, and even if it can become as strong as the Italian Fascist Party, it will only be a temporary surge and will ultimately be submerged under the tide. This can be asserted.</p>

Traffic was blocked, and the number of onlookers increased. The demonstrators insisted on not retreating and remained for four hours.

<p>National News Agency, Rome, 23rd: Although the Italian newspaper is still ridiculing Briand's United States of Europe plan, the Vatican newspaper today broke its long-standing silence and analyzed the content of the plan in detail. It believes that it is a valuable contribution to solving the European problem, provided that the proposed permanent congress is not merely a continuation of an incomplete League of Nations. It also quoted Briand's words, saying that the reason he drafted the note this time was simply because he was entrusted by the international community to do so. Furthermore, it stated that the current situation of the major European powers and the divergent opinions of various countries are not insurmountable obstacles to the organization of a federation. It must be known that in the past, it was simply the division of European countries that dragged the whole world into war. Now, if all of Europe is united into one country, it can be expected that all the nations of the world will achieve lasting peace and prosperity.</p>

<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: After continuous victories in Xiaoba and Liuhe, the Central Army took advantage of the situation to pursue the enemy. According to military news from the front, today (22nd) it has passed Lanfeng. At the same time, Liu Maoen's troops in eastern Henan turned back and moved westward. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Situation on the Liuhe Line: After being defeated in Xiaoba, Wan Xuancai's troops and the advance units of the Jin Army deployed defensive lines between Liuhe and Libaji. Guan Fu'an's troops were stationed on the old Yellow River embankment north of Liuhe. Sun Chu's troops were deployed on the railway front. Yang Xiaoou's troops were deployed northwest of Ninglu. In addition, there were Yang Yaofang's and Zhang Huizhao's troops, totaling five divisions, hoping to engage the Central Army in a decisive battle. Sun Chu also personally went to the front to command. The Central Army began its attack on the 20th, and on the 21st at dawn, the middle route and both sides of the railway simultaneously launched a general offensive. The fierce battle was extremely intense. One division even used a brave assault team to charge with bayonets. The enemy troops could not withstand the attack and retreated completely. The Central Army successively captured Longmenzhai and Liuhezhai, seizing over five thousand rifles and dozens of mortars and mountain cannons, and killing over a thousand enemy soldiers. Countless military supplies and luggage were captured. Libaji was immediately completely occupied, and the troops met up with the units arriving from the flanks and continued to advance eastward. According to a telephone report from the front, the Central Army crossed Neihuang this morning (22nd) and arrived in Lanfeng at noon. It also ordered the former Director of Construction of Henan, Zhang Fang, to go to Bian immediately. Liu Zhi also telegraphed Xu to report to Zhang Fang and requested that they go to the front to discuss everything.</p>
<p>Liu Maoen's Defection: Liu Maoen and Wan Xuancai were originally troops under Liu Zhenhua. Since moving to eastern Henan, they had been close to the Central Army. First, there was news that Wan was willing to pledge allegiance to the Central Government, but he ultimately hesitated and failed to pledge allegiance. Liu Maoen's troops were stationed in the Guanyintang area near Ningling in eastern Henan. Suddenly, on the 20th, he sent a telegram pledging allegiance to the Central Government and detained Wan Xuancai. The telegram described the difficult situation over the years and was sent from Guide Station. Liu has taken up the position of Commander-in-Chief of the 11th Route of the Punitive Expeditionary Force and led his troops, including Ruan Xun, Xu Pengyun, Wu Tinglin, and other divisions, to attack Yang Xiaoou's troops on the flank on the night of the 20th, and advanced westward to attack Bian. Liu Zhi and Ma Rilong telegraphed Xu to report that Commander-in-Chief Liu Maoen responded to our army and attacked the flank of the rebel army on the night of the 20th, seizing over a thousand rifles from Yang Xiaoou's rebel troops. Zhou, the director of the 2nd Army Corps, also telegraphed Xu to report that Commander-in-Chief Liu Maoen of the 11th Route Army responded to our army and attacked the enemy's rear flank from northwest of Ningling on the night of the 20th, seizing over two thousand rifles from Yang Xiaoou's troops. Wan, the rebel Xuancai, has been captured by Commander-in-Chief Liu, and after the remaining troops of the rebel surrender their weapons, they will be sent to Beijing, etc.</p>

<p>Transfers Handling to the Nearest Consolidated Tax Bureau</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government, because the income from the Zhejiang Province coal tax has decreased after the reduction of the tax rate, has decided to abolish the Coal Tax Bureau and its subordinate branches and merge them into the various Consolidated Tax Bureaus. Yesterday, the Financial Department issued a notice to the various Consolidated Tax Bureaus stating: "The Zhejiang Province coal tax, since the tax rate was reduced from three cents and three mills and six li per ton, has resulted in a decrease in income, making it unnecessary to establish a special bureau. The special bureau and its subordinate branches should be abolished and transferred to the nearest Consolidated Tax Bureaus for handling. This has been proposed by this department and passed by the Provincial Government Committee. In addition to ordering the Coal Tax Bureau to properly conclude the bureau's affairs and completely hand over everything by the end of May, a register shall be prepared and reported for verification. The bureau chief shall comply with the order and take over the bureau on schedule, conscientiously collect taxes, and receive the files, equipment, and other items from the general and branch bureaus. The tax revenue collected shall be reported separately and not included in comparisons in order to ensure accuracy and facilitate auditing. The date of receipt shall be reported for investigation."</p>
<h3 id="e74">The Problem of Suppressing and Appeasing the Han Bandits in Anhui Province <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The remaining troops of Yu Yanong's band, led by Han Shijie, who were entrenched in Yingshan, were previously requested by the Anhui Provincial Government to be jointly suppressed by Guo's troops from Su Tai and Xia and Dai's troops from Luotian, together with Pan Shanzhai's brigade, on three sides, as requested by the Wuhan Headquarters. Now, the central government, considering that the band has pledged allegiance, has telegraphed an order to cease the offensive. However, the provincial government believes that the issue of suppression and appeasement needs to be resolved quickly and has telegraphed Wuhan Headquarters Chairman He Yingqin for instructions. The telegram reads as follows: "To Director He Yingqin of the Wuhan Headquarters: Recently, we received a telegram from Brigade Commander Wang of Wuxue and Regiment Commander Ouyang stating that they are attacking the Han bandits and have received an order from your office that the Han bandits have now pledged allegiance and ordered them to stop advancing and return to suppress the Communist bandits in Guangji, etc. If the Han bandits are sincerely willing to surrender, it would naturally be a blessing for the local area. However, according to a telegram from the county magistrate of Taihu, the bandits have demanded a large sum of money and are showing signs of fleeing back. We are deeply concerned that the Han bandits are cunning and using delaying tactics, wantonly devastating the local area. Whether to suppress or appease, we request a quick decision be shown. Ma Fuxiang, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, bows respectfully."</p>
<h3 id="e75">Post-Recapture Reconstruction Conference in Guide <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>A decision was made to form a Comfort Mission and a Military-Civilian Joint Celebration Association. Correspondents in Guide report that after the Central Army occupied Guide at 1:00 AM on the 19th, the First Propaganda Brigade of the General Political Training Department immediately entered the city to work at dawn that day. The streets were covered with posters denouncing the rebels. At the same time, personnel were dispatched to investigate the post-war situation. Businesses and civilians had their property looted, and funds from various agencies and schools were taken away by the enemy troops, with salaries unpaid for months. The capture of enemy general Wan Dianzun and the surrender of his troops were met with popular acclaim. However, during the city's assault, the Central Army prioritized a rapid attack, resulting in the bombing and destruction of some houses and casualties among residents. Wu Yaoguang, a standing committee member of the County Party Department, was also wounded by the bombing. Upon witnessing this situation, Kang Ze, the Propaganda Brigade Commander, convened representatives from various agencies and groups at the county government at 1:00 PM that afternoon to discuss post-war reconstruction. Li Chunyan, the chairman, reported that after the Yan-Feng rebellion, the Central Army had been winning successive victories, and the city had now been recaptured. However, it was devastated, and post-war reconstruction needed to be addressed urgently, urging everyone to offer their opinions. After the report, the first item discussed was how to comfort the affected civilians in the city. It was decided to form a temporary Comfort Committee for Shangqiu County, with the representatives from thirteen agencies and groups, including the Farmers' Association, General Labor Union, Education Bureau, Women's Association, Chamber of Commerce, County Party Department, County Government, Public Security Bureau, General Headquarters Propaganda Brigade, Red Swastika Society, Red Cross Society, Autonomous Preparatory Office, and Garrison Headquarters, acting as preparation committee members. The County Party Department was assigned to convene a meeting. The next item discussed was how to report hidden rebels in the city. It was decided that the County Government Public Security Bureau, district chiefs, and the Chamber of Commerce would coordinate with the Garrison Headquarters to handle this. Another item discussed was strictly prohibiting stores from raising prices. It was decided that the Chamber of Commerce would set fair prices, notify all stores to comply, and the County Government would issue a strict prohibition notice. Finally, the preparation for a joint military-civilian celebration was discussed. It was decided that (1) the original members of the Temporary Comfort Committee would remain as preparation committee members, and sixteen additional agencies, including the Construction Bureau, Civil Defense Brigade Headquarters, and district representatives, would be added to the preparation committee; (2) the County Party Department, Women's Association, Public Security Bureau, Civil Defense Brigade Headquarters, Propaganda Brigade, and Education Bureau would serve as standing committee members and be responsible for the following tasks: General Affairs Section (County Party Department), Propaganda Section (Propaganda Brigade), Reception Section (Women's Association), Discipline Section (Public Security Bureau and Civil Defense Brigade Headquarters), and Entertainment Section (Education Bureau); (3) the venue would be the Zhongshan Club; (4) the date would be 10:00 AM on the 21st of this month (May 20th).</p>
<h3 id="e76">Resolution of the Guangxi Situation: Zhu and Chen Return to Guangdong <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Correspondence from Guangzhou reports that since the Guangxi war began on the 22nd of last month, the Zhang-Gui forces have been continuously gathering their main forces in northern Guangxi, effectively abandoning southern Guangxi. Only a small number of troops were stationed in the strategic locations of Xunzhou and Guixian to contain the forces of the Sixth and Eighth Route Armies. The Sixth and Eighth Route Armies also saw through their scheme, so after capturing Taozhou, they transferred most of their main forces back to Guangdong. All air and naval forces that had entered Guangxi also had no need to stay there for long and have been returning to Guangdong in succession in recent days. Zhu Shaoliang, Commander-in-Chief of the Sixth Route Army, and Chen Jitang, Commander-in-Chief of the Eighth Route Army, believing that the Guangxi war had been resolved without further conflict and that a change of strategy was necessary to deal with the enemy in the future, jointly took the "Wu Feng" gunboat from Wuzhou back to Guangdong on the morning of the 18th. They arrived at San Shui Kou at 7:00 PM that afternoon, then transferred to a special Guangsan railway car at Kou and arrived in the province at 8:50 PM that night. At 10:00 PM that evening, Chen Mingshu, Chairman of the Provincial Government, hosted a banquet at Tuisiyuan to welcome Zhu and Chen. Zhu and Chen gave detailed reports on the Guangxi war at the banquet, and the gathering dispersed at around 11:00 PM. The next day (the 19th) at noon, Zhu and Chen attended the joint Party, Government, and Military Commemoration Week at the Provincial Party Headquarters and gave a public report on the Guangxi situation and the course of the war. Heads of various agencies and staff members were present, and Chen Mingshu chaired the meeting, introducing Zhu and Chen to deliver the report. Zhu Shaoliang began by saying that the enemy in Guangxi had been repeatedly defeated and was no longer able to fight, but was relying on the natural barriers of Xun and Gui to eke out a meager existence. Therefore, the Sixth and Eighth Route Armies' entry into Guangxi to suppress the rebellion had Xun and Gui as their ultimate destinations. However, due to transportation difficulties, it took three to four months to finally break through Xun. Before the order to attack Xun was given, the enemy sent a part of their forces to attack Pingnan Jiangkou, hoping to strike our army's rear and relieve the siege of Xunzhou. Our army used a counter-strategy, responding with a considerable force while still using naval, land, and air forces to converge on Xunzhou. Xun city was inherently a fortress and had strong defensive fortifications, making it traditionally easy to defend and difficult to attack. However, modern firepower is fierce, and the situation is very different. Even with strong fortifications, they cannot withstand the sharp fire of modern weapons, so our army captured Xunzhou in one fell swoop. The enemy's morale was already low after the previous defeats when they returned to Guangxi. Adding to this, in the Battle of Beiliu, the elite forces of the Zhang-Gui army lost more than half their strength. Now that the remaining enemies are unable to establish a foothold in Guangxi, they are forced to flee. We only need to send a small force to pursue them to wipe them out. The situation in Guangxi is no longer a problem. I am taking this opportunity to return to Guangdong with Commander-in-Chief Chen Jitang to discuss post-war arrangements in Guangxi with Chairman Chen Mingshu. Chen Jitang then stood up and reported that the Guangxi enemy forces had been defeated by our army, and most of them have scattered. Our army is currently sending troops to pursue them while preparing for post-war reconstruction. Recently, the Yunnan army has crossed Bose, and post-war reconstruction in Guangxi can be carried out step by step. The rumors that some of the defeated enemies fled to northern Guangdong are not credible. The remaining enemy forces are demoralized and lack ammunition and weapons, so it can be concluded that they are unable to cause trouble in Guangdong. Now that the military situation in the front has been resolved, the Eighth Route Army is transferring a part of its forces to northern Guangdong to suppress bandits. The entry of the large army into Guangxi in recent days has allowed bandits in the rear to take the opportunity to cause disturbances. Now that the Guangxi situation has been stabilized, our province will soon carry out pacification and bandit suppression work, which is expected to begin around June. After the report, it was already 4:00 PM, and the meeting adjourned. It is said that Zhu and Chen will not return to Guangxi unless absolutely necessary (May 20th).</p>
<h3 id="e77">Guangdong Province's Inland Revenue Tax in the Midst of Calls for Its Abolition <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Annual Revenue of Approximately 8 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Guangzhou Municipality Recently Introduced a Wharf Tax</p>
<p>Correspondence from Guangzhou: Recently, Guangdong Province submitted a report on the entire province's likin to the Ministry, as a preparation for abolishing likin and increasing taxes. After receiving the order, the financial authorities rushed to prepare a form and submitted it to the Ministry. It is said that Guangdong Province's annual revenue from foreign likin and various factory likin is approximately 5,720,400 yuan. The expenses for foreign merchants' sitting likin offices and fortresses are approximately 1,517,600 yuan. Various local taxes similar to likin in prefectures and counties are approximately 1,626,800 yuan. The total revenue is approximately 8,864,800 yuan. When converted at a 20% increase to the common Cantonese silver dollar, it totals 11,081,000 yuan. These figures are based on the most recent collections. Furthermore, Guangdong Province only has expenses for sitting likin offices and fortresses and has never had a unified tax name. In 1929, the actual revenue from various sitting likin offices was 510,155.96 silver dollars. The actual revenue in February was 364,794.79 silver dollars. The actual revenue in March was 831,603.23 silver dollars. The above are the general figures for likin in the entire province of Guangdong. Based on these figures, the Finance Department has already telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for review. Amidst the calls for abolishing likin, merchants and civilians have recently been requesting the abolition of various surcharges and taxes. Among those submitted for exemption are the banquet tax and the theater tax. According to the Finance Department, the banquet tax is not a trivial surcharge and cannot be easily abolished. As for the theater tax, the Municipal Administrative Conference has already resolved to allow the revision of the grade-based salary scale for cinemas. However, the wharf tax that the municipal government recently proposed to collect has recently been decided to be implemented, and the wharf surcharge has been changed to a wharf tax. There are many wharf properties along the coast of Guangzhou. If the tax is implemented, the municipal treasury will have a large amount of revenue each year. Here are the measures for collecting Guangzhou Municipality's wharf tax as approved by the Municipal Administrative Conference: (1) The collection of the wharf tax along the embankments of Guangzhou Special Municipality is based on the monthly rental value of each wharf as estimated by the Finance Bureau in conjunction with the Works and Land Bureaus, as the standard for calculating the annual rent; (2) Taxes are collected in installments each year, with each half-year as one installment. The monthly rental of each wharf along the embankment is calculated for each installment, and 10% of the annual rental value is collected; (3) This wharf tax will be collected from the first installment of 1930 (i.e., the first half of the year); (4) When collecting the wharf tax, a tax table will first be published with the amount of tax due for each wharf for the current installment, and the tax table will be sent to each wharf tenant to forward to the owner for review; (5) This wharf tax will be collected directly from the wharf tenants by personnel from the Finance Bureau accompanied by police officers. Tenants are allowed to submit receipts to the owners to offset the rent; (6) The first installment of the wharf tax for 1930 must be paid in full within one month of the start of collection; (7) A penalty of 1% will be added for wharf taxes that are overdue for more than one month, a penalty of 2% will be added for more than three months, and a penalty of 5% will be added for more than six months. If two or more installments of the wharf tax are owed, the wharf may be seized to offset the debt; (8) When a wharf tenant terminates the lease, all outstanding wharf taxes must be paid before the account can be canceled (May 19th evening).</p>
<h3 id="e78">British Return of the Xiamen Concession <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Correspondence from Fuzhou: The public concessions established by various countries in Xiamen, except for Gulangyu across the sea, include the area of beach near the sea after Fuxing on the Xiamen side, which was demarcated by the British Consul as a separate British concession. The British built enclosures, stationed police, prohibited gatherings from passing through, and collected land rent from the people. Our government officials have repeatedly negotiated, but without effect. It was not until the May Thirtieth Massacre occurred that the British Consul in Xiamen, seeing the intense national sentiment of our people, feared that it would lead to an incident. So, he voluntarily removed the police and stopped the construction of the enclosure to ease public anger. Since the entry of the Party Army into Fujian, the Xiamen government has actively improved municipal administration, expanded roads, rebuilt shops, filled in beaches, and cleared mountains. Transportation has become greatly convenient, and commerce has become increasingly developed. The sea-back beach, with its remote location, cannot compete with the Chinese area and has become desolate. The British government believes that retaining this piece of wasteland is of no practical benefit and only leaves a bad impression on the Chinese people, which is not a good plan. In order to adapt to the environment, it has changed its diplomatic strategy and instructed the British Consul in Xiamen to return the land rights of the concession to our country as a sign of goodwill. Yesterday, the Provincial Government received a report from Yang Tingshu, the magistrate of Siming County, stating that he had received an order from the Zhangxia Naval Garrison Headquarters and a letter from the British Consul in Xiamen, Zhuo Naisi, stating that the British government, concerned about the Chinese government and people and wanting to show friendship, will return the Xiamen British Concession to China for self-administration. The procedure will be the simplest possible. All lease contracts issued by the former British government will be canceled, and the Chinese government will issue stamped deeds instead, which will be transferred to the British Consul for transfer to the households. The stamped deeds will be issued free of charge. However, the land rent should be paid at the same rate as before. The date of cancellation of the lease contracts will be the date when the stamped deeds are completed and returned to the British Consul for transfer. The British Consul has received orders from the British Minister to return the Xiamen British Concession to China for self-administration without any conditions. It is a sincere return. In order to comply with the times and recover national rights, we should immediately take over. In addition to replying to the letter, the magistrate should quickly contact the British Consul to handle it properly and report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for review and implementation. The magistrate should also report the handling situation for the record. The Xiamen British Concession does not have a public works bureau or other public property. The takeover procedure is very simple. It seems that it can be handled according to the British Consul's proposal. The land rent for each household is currently paid at the same rate as before. The county has followed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' instructions when recovering the Zhenjiang Concession, notifying the British Minister and declaring that before the National Government promulgates land tax measures and before the new tax laws are implemented in the Xiamen area, all those who hold British Royal Deeds in Xiamen will pay the current annual rent at the current rate. Except for reporting to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for approval, the Provincial Government has ordered compliance (May 20th).</p>
<h3 id="e79">Strict Defense by the Wuhan Garrison Command <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The Wuhan Garrison Command believes that with the military situation at the front being intense, the security of Wuhan should be strictly arranged to prevent petty theft. Yesterday, three proclamations were issued, which are recorded as follows: (1) The Wuhan rail and road transportation system is complex. During the suppression of the rebellion, it is inevitable that Communist Party members and various reactionary elements will be hiding in the city, taking the opportunity to incite trouble. We should be vigilant and maintain security. In addition to separate special regulations for Hankou, in the cities of Wuchang and Hanyang, during this military period, pedestrians are prohibited from 12:00 AM to dawn the next day. Public officials must provide a password and clear explanation when going out on official business before being allowed to pass. Otherwise, no one is allowed to pass through any street to prevent traitors and ensure security. In addition to issuing orders, this proclamation is hereby made; (2) Wuhan is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, and there is a mixture of people. Street dwellers and evil people often make groundless accusations and create incidents, or make reckless remarks and spread conspiracy theories. Although there may be no intention in the street talk, it is like spreading rumors and creating panic. The Communist Party and various reactionary elements also take the opportunity to stir up trouble and carry out reactionary propaganda to achieve their sinister plots. During this military period, strict investigation and prohibition are particularly important. In addition to ordering a strict investigation and arrest, this proclamation is hereby made earnestly, and all people are hereby informed that if anyone dares to defy the law and create or spread rumors, they will be severely investigated and punished without leniency; (3) The urban and rural areas of Wuchang and Hanyang, as well as Snake Mountain and Tortoise Mountain, are densely populated areas or important fortresses, which are different from the wilderness. Hunting is not allowed at will. It has been reported that people are often shooting birds with guns in these areas, which, although a game, disrupts public order and should be prohibited. In addition to ordering the military police to patrol and arrest offenders at any time, this proclamation is hereby made known to all (May 23rd).</p>
<h3 id="e80">Enemy Troops Completely Withdraw from Western and Northern Shandong <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Correspondence from Jinan: Today, I visited Jiang Bocheng, Chief Counselor of the Land, Sea, and Air Force Headquarters. According to his statement, Shi Yousan's forces in Caozhou have completely withdrawn. There are no traces of the enemy on the south bank of the Yellow River in Shandong. Shi Yousan's forces are now gathering in the Dongming area, and some have retreated to Changyuan on the north bank of the Yellow River. Shi telegraphed Han Fuju, requesting that someone be sent to negotiate surrender, but our army is still pursuing them. Commander-in-Chief Han will return to Jinan within days to discuss everything. On the northern Shandong front, the Jin army cavalry that previously occupied various counties under the jurisdiction of Wuding Prefecture has completely withdrawn to Dezhou in the past two days. Therefore, there are now no enemies south of the Yellow River and east of the Jinpu Railway. According to statistics, there are only a few enemies north of the Yellow River and west of the Jinpu Railway in Shandong, which will be easily cleared soon. According to news from the First Army Corps of Han Fuju's forces, the First Army Corps did not participate in the initial stages of the war in western Shandong. After Shi Yousan's forces attacked Heze, Han Fuju led his troops to the area. It is said that the Guan Fuan and Liu Chunrong troops of the enemy suffered the greatest losses, while Shi Yousan's forces suffered relatively minor losses (May 22nd).</p>

<h3 id="e81">Hunan Province Plans to Establish Construction Bureaus in Various Counties <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>To Be Established Separately Starting in the Fiscal Year 1930. Correspondence from Changsha: The Hunan Provincial Government considers the Construction Bureau to be one of the four bureaus of the county government. Currently, construction projects in various counties need to be progressed urgently. It is appropriate to establish bureaus to manage them, so as to assign responsibilities. The expenditure budget for the second half of the fiscal year 1929 in Hunan Province has specified the funds for the construction bureaus of various counties to be disbursed by the provincial treasury. Since the establishment was not implemented in 1929, it is difficult to delay it further in the next fiscal year. At this construction conference, many county magistrates proposed the establishment of construction bureaus. Moreover, the central government stipulated that the deadline for completing the county organization in Hunan Province is the end of August 1930. Therefore, the Construction Department has considered the situation in various counties and plans to separately stipulate the procedures for establishing construction bureaus in various counties starting in the fiscal year 1930. First, it will be submitted to the construction conference for discussion and approval, and then it will be submitted to the 101st routine meeting of the provincial government on the 16th of this month for approval. The measures are as follows: (1) Construction bureaus will be established first in first and second-class counties, and construction sections will be temporarily established in all third-class counties (however, if there are special circumstances in second-class counties that require delaying the establishment of a bureau, the bureau may be changed to a section in accordance with Article 11 of the amended Provincial County Government Four Bureau Organization Outline); (2) The change of a bureau to a section in second and third-class counties will be limited to one year. After the local construction funds are raised and determined, bureaus should still be established in accordance with the regulations; (3) The salary of the section chief of the construction section may be paid by the provincial treasury according to the original amount of the bureau chief, but no additional provincial subsidies will be paid; (4) Before the examination is held, the candidates for bureau chief or section chief should be temporarily assessed by the Construction Department from among the qualified registered technical personnel in accordance with the provincial government's instructions, and the best candidates should be appointed.</p>

<p>Director of Education Bureau Accused: Ren Xuan, the Director of the Jiaxing County Education Bureau, has not made any significant contributions to educational facilities, and the educational content in various districts is also not well-organized, causing local criticism. Recently, the director received a report from Xu Gengmin, a former tenant of the school land, stating that a large amount of school land had been encroached upon. After the Education Fund Committee resolved to investigate the matter based on the report, the individuals involved, upon being summoned, did not appear, causing the case to remain unresolved. Two villagers from Fengjieqiao Township, Ma Furu and Ma Deyou, were also reported to have encroached upon school land. After being notified by the county, the Ma family stated that the land they were currently cultivating had been purchased from the Che family during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty and had been managed for many years, with taxes paid regularly. For over twenty years, there had been no disputes, so they did not understand why they were being falsely accused of encroaching upon school land. They hired attorney Xuan Jucao to file a lawsuit in court to claim ownership. The Education Bureau, without waiting for the court's resolution, falsely summoned Ma Deyou to a meeting on the case, induced him to go to the bureau, and forced him to hand over his property certificate. When he stated that he had already submitted it to the court, they did not investigate and immediately detained Ma Deyou. Therefore, attorney Xuan, again hired by Ma, filed a complaint with the court against Ren Xuan, accusing him of illegal detention and requesting legal action. He also sent telegrams to the provincial government, the high court, and the education department, requesting investigation and handling of the matter.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Kong Xiangxi's Instructions at the Commodity Inspection Bureau Yesterday <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau has been established for one year and two months. Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Industry and Commerce, considers the bureau an affiliated agency of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, whose purpose is to enhance international trade credit and improve the value of export commodities, which is of great importance. Therefore, he has paid exceptional attention to it. He has visited the bureau twice since its establishment and provided much guidance on ongoing matters. Recently, with the successive establishment of the bureau's cotton, livestock, and raw silk inspection offices, as well as the chemical testing office, and with the lace inspection office also in active preparation, the bureau's operations have been developing daily. He made a special visit to the bureau yesterday (the 24th) at 10:00 AM to inspect it. Vice Minister Mu Xiangyue, Technical Advisor Xu Shanxiang, Technical Officer Zhang Jun, and others also arrived successively. Director Zou first accompanied them on a tour of the entire bureau, followed by a meeting with the director, deputy director, secretary, department heads, and technicians. Director Zou delivered a speech, and the department heads reported on the status of inspection work. Minister Kong then delivered instructions, stating that the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau had made rapid progress in its year of establishment. The success was due to Director Zou's proper management and the joint efforts of all staff. "I have four thoughts today. First, it must be revolutionary. All the ills of international trade must be completely eradicated. Second, it must be constructive, so that the achievements of the bureau are new every day and different every year. Third, it must be scientific. Not only should the inspection of commodities conform to scientific methods, but also the spirit of perseverance and long-term scientific research should be used to study inspection policies to make discoveries and improvements. Fourth, it must be business-like. In dealing with merchants, all matters should be treated as one, so that they do not feel they are dealing with officials." In addition, he encouraged the bureau staff with four phrases: "Work hard, maintain credit, communicate business information, and strive for progress." The instructions lasted about an hour. Afterwards, he went to the raw silk inspection office and the silk market to convene all staff members, over a hundred people, and repeated the above points, expressing them earnestly. He also said that Shanghai is a port of international commerce, and the position and responsibility of the Commodity Inspection Bureau are more important than other inspection bureaus. "You come here to work, not only for the Inspection Bureau, nor only for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, but for the Republic of China. If you hold this spirit and move forward, you will surely contribute to the development of international trade." All the staff members were deeply moved. Vice Minister Mu Xiangyue also gave very earnest instructions. After the meeting, he took a photo with all the staff members of the bureau. He left the bureau at 1:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Discussion on the Placement of Employees in the Pharmaceutical Industry</p>
<p>Recommendation of Yu Qiaqing and Others as Petition Representatives</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee convened a plenary committee meeting for the past two days to address the placement of employees in the pharmaceutical industry. Twenty-three committee members attended, and Wang Xiaolai was publicly elected as chairman. After the formalities, the chairman first invited Party Department representative Tong Xingbai and Social Affairs Bureau Director Pan to report on the process and rationale of the Party and government agencies in handling the case, followed by a report from the secretary on the details of the case, and then a discussion on the following matters: (1) Discussing the placement of unemployed workers in the pharmaceutical industry. It was noted that the hiring of employees is the sole prerogative of the store owner: (1) It must depend on the store's own business conditions, (2) It must depend on the skills and character of the person being hired to make a decision. Only the store owner knows the benefits and drawbacks best. All countries only adopt unemployment introduction and unemployment insurance systems for unemployment relief, because the complete or incomplete power to employ employees has a great relationship with the survival of the store. Since the matter has been in a stalemate for a long time, to seek a win-win situation, it is necessary to petition the Central Government to have the Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee and the pharmaceutical industry organizations select those with docile natures from the unemployed workers and do their best to take responsibility for introduction, which is in line with the good intentions of the Party and government authorities to strive for relief for unemployed workers, and it does not conflict with the store's right to employ people. Resolved: Yu Qiaqing, Ye Huijun, Wang Yansong, Wang Xiaolai, Wen Lanting and other five committee members were publicly elected as representatives to petition all parties. (2) The issue of replacement workers in the pharmaceutical industry. After the unemployed workers in the pharmaceutical industry have been given funds and sent back to their place of origin, there are in fact no unemployed workers within the city's area. Therefore, although the Central Government's proposed measures include this issue, it will be handled as a separate case in the future. However, since there is no possibility of implementation in reality, it is proposed to petition the Central Government to cancel it. Resolved: Handed over to the petition representatives for vigorous advocacy. (3) Discussion on the issue of various industries requesting to convene a representative assembly of various industries (A) The issue of various industries' trade unions requesting precedent. On the 22nd, at the plenary meeting of the committee, Party Department representative Tong Xingbai stated on the spot, "I can represent the Party Department in stating that other industries must not demand it in the same way, and the Party Department must not blindly provide assistance." Social Affairs Bureau Director Pan also stated on the spot that the issue of inserting unemployed workers is limited to the pharmaceutical industry, and only to this pharmaceutical dispute. Therefore, the matter of trade unions in various industries using it as a precedent should not become a reality. (B) The issue of unanimously petitioning the Central Government. Resolved: Regarding the request of trade unions in various industries to follow the precedent, this committee should request the Party and government agencies to provide concrete guarantees. As for the representative assembly of various industries, it will be convened again when necessary. (4) Discussion on the issue of protecting human rights. In addition to the temporary chairman Wang Xiaolai requesting the Social Affairs Bureau Director Pan on the spot, promising to protect it in accordance with the law, it was also resolved that the telegram sent by this committee to the Central Government was a gentle plea based on legal principles and facts, and a letter should be sent to the Central Publicity Department, the Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Party Department, and the Municipal Government, allowing the drafts sent by this committee to the newspapers to be published as much as possible without restriction.</p>

Upon approval, before the case was presented, the county magistrates of Qimen and Wuyuan counties, as well as local public groups in the counties, presented it to the government one after another, and repeatedly telegraphed the Jiangxi Provincial Government, requesting special accommodation to instruct counties such as Poyang and Fuliang to transport rice as usual. In addition, the Qimen Flag Provincial Fellow-Villagers Association publicly recommended representative Hu Wei-yin to visit and request consideration, and the case was transferred for consultation. The cause was approved, except for the re-telegraphing of the Jiangxi Provincial Government to approve the flow of rice for transportation, and the distribution of telegrams to the county magistrates of Huining and other counties in the two prefectures for proper maintenance and remedy. Special review and verification of the Anhui Provincial Government Hao seal. (2) To the Anhui Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai, we are aware of the letter dated May 9th, and the matter of relief should be handled as required. However, after investigating the counties in this province, we found that they suffered repeated wind, insect, flood, and drought disasters last year, and the harvest was meager. The provincial affairs meeting has resolved to order the Accounting Council to rush to Shanghai to purchase 10,000 stones of Xian rice, and to convene gentry and merchants to raise additional funds to purchase 100,000 stones of Xian rice to the province for low-price sales, and the records are on file. Furthermore, civil food maintenance organizations in various counties have automatically raised funds and requested the issuance of passports to purchase rice in Shanghai. Many have come here. The lack of rice and grain in this province has indeed been difficult to manage and there is no surplus available for assistance. Special reply to this telegram, hoping to be understood, Jiangxi Provincial Government Hao seal.</p>

<p>Liu Heshan's Boat Anchors in Dongxiang, Qingpu</p>
<p>Boatmen Sound Gongs and Villagers Gather from Various Villages</p>
<p>Liu Heshan's clam shell-hulled rice boat, carrying 160 stones of white rice loaded in Qingjiao to Shanghai for sale, was anchored in Dongxiang, Biaopu, around 6:00 AM the day before yesterday. Suddenly, more than a dozen small boats arrived and stopped next to Liu's boat. Dozens of men and women told Liu that they were Hunan refugees and that the harvest in the fields last year was poor, making it impossible to beg along the way. "We have a total of more than 300 people in our group. We heard that your boat is loaded with rice and grain. We implore you to lend us a little to avoid starvation." Liu listened and immediately secretly instructed his crew to go ashore and sound the gong for help, while telling the refugees, "The rice in the boat is cargo for customers. I only get paid for transportation. If anything is missing, the owner will ask me to compensate. Please find another way." However, the women on the boat ignored the explanation and opened the cargo hold, preparing to move the rice with baskets. Unexpectedly, the crew sounded the gong on the shore, and villagers from various villages gathered upon hearing the sound. Seeing the large number of people on the shore, the refugees quickly sailed away in their boats towards the South River. Liu checked the rice and found that it had not been stolen, but his own clothes and the crew's bedding had been taken away by the refugees. The loss was limited, truly a blessing in disguise. Rice boats in Shanghai were informed and became wary, and are now discussing defense measures.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Mediation Proceedings <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Concerning the Zhifu Lane Housing Case</p>
<p>The Great China Company Aims to Settle the Matter</p>
<p>Willing to Negotiate a Fair Solution</p>
<p>The case involving the tenants of Zhifu Lane on Nanjing Road and the landlord, the Dalun Company, initially arose due to eviction issues. Subsequently, the court adopted the tenants' claims, allowing the landlord to reclaim the property but limiting it to personal use. After the retrial judgment, the Dalun Company, being subject to the verdict, originally intended to appeal to the Supreme Court. However, the Great China Company, considering the tenants' claim of established custom and the court's judgment, believed that purchasing the land for self-use would be better than leasing it and causing disputes. Therefore, they decisively prepared the price and purchased the Dalun property, intending to settle the matter and avoid further complications. After purchasing the land, the Great China Company notified the tenants, setting a deadline of the end of May for them to relocate. However, the tenants have not yet responded. The Great China Company, fearing potential misunderstandings with the tenants, sent a letter to the Guangzhao Public Association, requesting them to mediate on their behalf, based on their shared hometown connection, with several tenants, including the China Underwear Company. The Public Association, noting that only a minority of the tenants were Cantonese, forwarded the letter to the Business Rectification Association for overall guidance. Having accepted the request, the Business Rectification Association has sent letters to all tenants, inviting them to a meeting for negotiations. It is hoped that among the tenants, there will be enlightened individuals who, once guided by the Business Rectification Association, will resolve the matter peacefully. The original letter from the Guangzhao Public Association to the Business Rectification Association is included below for your reference:</p>
<p>To the Shanghai Business Community Rectification Committee,</p>
<p>Greetings. We recently received a letter from the Great China Co., Ltd., stating: "Our company has been preparing since its inception for over a year, painstakingly establishing our company, and we are planning to build a commercial center to promote domestic products and contribute to the people's livelihood. However, due to the leased land, the landlord Dalun Company was involved in litigation with the old tenants regarding the reconstruction of the building, causing delays in our company's planned progress. The details of the lawsuit between Dalun and the tenants have been reported in various newspapers, and the public has its own judgment, so there is no need to elaborate further. Currently, our board of directors believes that since the company's commercial center is restricted by the leased land, it would be better to purchase property for self-use to facilitate progress. Moreover, according to the reasons for the lawsuit presented by the tenants in the Provisional Court, they claim that Shanghai custom dictates that landlords can only reclaim property for their own use, and the court adopted this as the basis for its judgment. Regardless of whether the tenants' claim is valid, since our company has acquired the land, even if we fully comply with the custom claimed by the tenants, the tenants should have no grounds to deny our legitimate reason for reclaiming it for our own use. Therefore, our board of directors unanimously decided to prepare the price to purchase the Dalun property completely for our own use. Our company's desire to seek a compromise has reached its limit. We have separately notified the tenants of our acquired property rights and our intention to reclaim it for our own use, requesting them to relocate within the one-month period applicable according to common custom. However, the tenants have refused to accept this, which seems to be due to a misunderstanding. However, several tenants, such as the Nanyang Hosiery Factory, China Underwear Company, and Yi'an Residence, are all Cantonese businesses with established ties, and we hope that they can act fairly and not create obstacles that would lead to extreme measures. As for the other tenants, if they can avoid emotional disputes, our company is also willing to uphold the principle of peace and negotiate a fair solution. We have long admired the directors of your esteemed Public Association for their dedication to public welfare and service to our community. They always strive to protect the interests of the people. Therefore, we earnestly request your esteemed organization to uphold justice and mediate the dispute between our company and the tenants. Within our company's capabilities, we are willing to abide by your fair judgment to achieve the goal of settling the matter peacefully. This matter concerns the interests of the public, and we trust that the gentlemen of your esteemed organization will accept our request without hesitation."</p>
<p>Based on the above, it appears that the company involved is concerned that the other party may obstruct the exercise of their property rights, and has therefore requested our Public Association to mediate. We understand that there are more than twenty tenants involved. However, in addition to those from our province, such as the Nanyang Hosiery Factory, the other tenants have the same relationship. Therefore, they should be treated as a whole and encouraged to pursue a peaceful resolution. Our Public Association believes that the scope of the dispute is broad. Even if one side is resolved, the effect may be minimal. Your esteemed organization, with its leaders and wise men, can concentrate public opinion and conduct fair business judgment, and has a proven track record. Therefore, we should transfer the mediation task of this case to your esteemed organization for handling, so as to achieve peace and settle the matter, and strengthen public relations. This is addressed to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Consolidation Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Chen Mingjian's Actions Unacceptable to His Family <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Strangled to Death by His Mother and Wife</p>
<p>Mother and Wife Hated His Cruelty and Bullying</p>
<p>Assassinated in His Sleep by Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law</p>
<p>Body Strangled, Carried and Abandoned in the Wilderness</p>
<p>All Admitted Freely in Court</p>
<p>Chen Zhang, a woman from Suqian, due to her son Chen Mingjian's lack of diligence and addiction to opium, separated from him. Zhang now lives in a lean-to in the British Huayuanli No. 1681 on Robison Road in West Shanghai. Her son and daughter-in-law, Chen Zhu, live in No. 1658 in the same lane. Zhu also does not rely on her husband for support and makes a living by working. Chen, whenever he had no money to spend, in addition to using his wife's money, would still ask his wife for money to spend in opium dens. If she did not give it to him, he would resort to violence. Therefore, his mother and wife hated him to the bone and decided to eliminate this evil creature to avoid future troubles. At about 10 pm on the 22nd of this month, Mingjian was lying in his mother's room. The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law took advantage of his deep sleep and quickly took ropes to tie his hands and feet, and tightly stuffed cotton into his mouth. Mingjian woke up from his dream, unable to shout, and difficult to move his hands and feet, so he could only let them do as they pleased.</p>
<p>After a while, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law strangled him to death. Then, that night, they carried the body out and abandoned it in the nearby wilderness. At first, no one knew. The next morning, Chinese police officer No. 1054 of the Putuo Road patrol station was patrolling the area, and found the body, reporting it to the head of the police station. Detective Ji Liren, detective Ma Zonglai, detective Ma Mouxiang, and Western detective Kataier began investigating and learned the cause of the murder. They went to Chen Zhang and Chen Zhu at No. 1681 in North Huayuanli. The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law were arrested and sent to the women's prison of the Special District Court. Then, the body was transported to the autopsy room on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun of the Special District Court took his seat in the second court and ordered the two to be brought to court for interrogation. Prosecutor Xu Mei also attended the court to perform his prosecutorial duties. First, the police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that the defendant was being prosecuted for the crime of killing a relative under Article 283 of the criminal law. Then, the Chinese and Western detectives reported the investigation after discovering the body, saying that at the time they saw rope marks on the neck of the body, and suspected strangulation. There were many onlookers at the scene where the body was found, and one of the onlookers recognized the deceased as Chen Mingjian, and reported Chen's residence at No. 1658 in Huayuanli. They went to that address to investigate, and then learned that the two defendants were both at No. 1681, and then went to arrest the two women and brought them to the police station.</p>
<p>They admitted to the murder without hesitation, and said that after the murder, they put the body in a bamboo basket, and the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law carried it out and abandoned it, but they did not know where the bamboo basket was thrown, and had not yet been found. A carrying pole and a rope were found in the haystack in the kitchen of the house, and they were brought to the case. Judge Sun interrogated Chen Zhu, who stated that she was 23 years old, and worked in a factory. She had recently been sick and stopped working at home. The deceased was her husband. They had been married for four years and had no children. Her husband did not work and was addicted to opium. Most of his wages were spent. She hated him very much. Her mother-in-law, Zhang, was often beaten by him for not giving him money. The court asked who came up with the idea of the murder. She continued, "My husband asked my aunt for money a few days ago and got nothing. There was a big quarrel at that time. The night before last, my aunt called me to her place to discuss how to kill my husband."</p>
<p>"At that time, my husband was sleeping soundly in my aunt's kitchen. Then, my aunt first tied his hands and feet, and stuffed his mouth with cotton, and then strangled him with a rope." The court asked how old the deceased was and why he did not resist at the time. The woman replied that her husband was thirty years old and had been weakened by his addiction to opium, and was also fast asleep. The court further asked where she was when he was strangled, and she said, "I was watching. All the things like tying his hands and feet, stuffing his mouth with cotton, and strangling his neck were done by my aunt. After that, I helped carry him out and threw him in the wilderness. It was deep at night, and no one saw." Then he questioned Chen Zhang who confessed her husband was named Chen Anming and had died of illness on the 17th of the previous month. She had two sons and three daughters. The deceased was her eldest son. He had no occupation</p>
<p>Associated with bandits, and addicted to opium, spending two or three dollars every day. If she didn't give him money, he would assault her. So all my clothes were ruined. I was very angry. That's why I took advantage of him being asleep the night before and I tied his hands and feet, stuffed them with cotton, and strangled him with a rope. I ordered my daughter-in-law to help</p>
<p>Carry the body to be abandoned. I already had this idea last year, and I had discussed it with my daughter-in-law, but it was not carried out." Judge Sun ordered the two defendants to be returned to custody for further interrogation at a later date. At 11 o'clock, prosecutor Guo drove to the morgue to examine the body, ordered the Pushan Villa to claim the body and put it in a coffin.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Deputy Comprador of Ewo Bank Flees with Funds <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Two Clerks Arrested</p>
<p>Suspected of Collusion</p>
<p>Served in the Bank for Twelve Years</p>
<p>Each Paid a Surety of 30,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Zhu Jixing, the deputy comprador of the British Ewo Bank, fled with a huge sum of 150,000 yuan, abandoning his post. Later, he sent a letter to the bank, saying that he was forced to do so and would repay the money in the future. The bank has reported the case to the police and requested his arrest, as reported in this newspaper. After this incident, the bank's Western employees began to audit the accounts. Now, Xie Tonghou from Ningbo and Yu Xiling from Zhenjiang, both clerks, are suspected of colluding with Zhu. The day before yesterday at 1 pm, the General Patrol Room was notified by phone and dispatched Chinese detective Fei Kelun and Western detective Datts to arrest Xie and Yu. They were taken to the Special District Court yesterday morning to be tried by Judge Xu Jiashi. The defendants hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Jiang Baoli for their defense. According to the police lawyer Gan Jingxian, the fugitive Zhu Jixing had been embezzling from January to May 20 of this year. His method was to replace the collected bank drafts with fake drafts, resulting in a loss of 150,000 yuan. The bank has now commissioned an accountant to audit the accounts. In the accounts kept by the two defendants, the following omissions were discovered: (1) 9,000 taels, (2) 9,987 taels, (3) 1,929 taels, (4) 21,500 taels. In addition, there were silver notes worth 60,389.7 taels, but only 1,500 taels were recorded in the accounts. Therefore, the two defendants are being prosecuted under Article 357 of the criminal law. Next, Mr. Packster, a Western employee of Ewo Bank, stated that Xie and Yu were both employees in the comprador's office. The fugitive Zhu Jixing had served in the bank for 15 years, and Xie and Yu had also been there for 12 years. He was in charge of the Western accounts, while the Chinese accounts were entirely the responsibility of the comprador. Then, British accountant Hardman, hired by Ewo Bank, reported that after auditing the accounts, he found the same omissions as stated by lawyer Gan. When questioned, Xie Tonghou stated that the two account books were not important. He had notified comprador Zhu of the omissions, but they had to see the bank drafts to record them. The omissions were all because comprador Zhu had not handed over the bank drafts. Yu Xiling stated that he recorded the accounts of more than 60,000 and more than 20,000, and handed over the drafts to Huxster. At that time, Pai said that the drafts were forged. The police lawyer then presented a letter, saying that this letter was sent by Zhu to Xie after his escape, stating that 30,000 taels of silver had been returned to the bank, so Xie was especially suspected in this case. Finally, the two lawyers Jiang and Jiang requested that the defendants be allowed to post bail. Judge Xu ordered the defendants to pay a surety of 30,000 yuan and adjourned the hearing for further interrogation at a later date.</p>

<p>Frauds in Shanghai</p>
<p>Impersonates Court Clerk</p>
<p>Solicits Bribes for Investigating Sandalwood Case</p>
<p>The Sino-Australian Trading Company on Sijing Road and Chen Maotang were involved in a lawsuit in the Special District Court over the purchase of sandalwood. The opening of the trial has been reported in this newspaper. Unexpectedly, at 2 pm the day before yesterday, Wang Lianzhi from Suzhou, impersonating the clerk of Judge Xu Wenrong, who was presiding over the case, went to the Sino-Australian Company and solicited 15 yuan and 8 jiao from the employee Zhou Xinzhi. Zhou suspected something was amiss and immediately telephoned the Special District Court to inquire. He learned that it was indeed a scam and reported it to the General Patrol Room. Detectives were dispatched and arrested Wang, seizing a diary and a litigation document from him. Yesterday morning, he was taken to the Special District Court to be tried by Judge Xu. Chief Prosecutor Zhou also attended the court to perform his prosecutorial duties. First, the police lawyer stated that Wang Lianzhi was accused of (1) impersonating a public official and (2) fraud. Then, Zhou Xinzhi stated that the defendant claimed to be Judge Xu's clerk and an investigator from the First Division of the court, specially dispatched to investigate the details of the case. He believed him to be true at the time and handed over the case files for review. Wang reviewed and copied them, and said that the trial would continue on June 2, and evidence should be submitted at that time. Finally, he solicited an investigation fee of 15 yuan and 8 jiao, asking to see his identification badge, but the defendant said he did not bring it. When questioned, the defendant stated that he was an elementary school teacher in Suzhou. He came to Shanghai to impersonate a newspaper reporter after seeing the lawsuit reported in the newspaper and tried to cheat the company, but did not impersonate a court official. Judge Xu ordered the defendant to be detained and adjourned the hearing for further interrogation at a later date.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 12:40 pm, a young man dressed in rags and looking disheveled hailed a sampan No. 1212 at the Jiujiang Road Wharf, saying he wanted to cross the river. When the sampan reached the center of the river, the man suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide. His body sank, but then quickly resurfaced. The sampan operator, Chen A Jin, managed to rescue him and sent him to the Lujiazui Water Police Station. After being questioned by the police chief, the man stated that his name was Li Jugeng, 26 years old, from Ningbo. He had been wandering in Shanghai for many years, relying on selling newspapers to make a living. He had recently recovered from a serious illness. However, after the illness, his finances were tight and he was unable to resume his old business. He had no relatives or friends to help him. He had no one to turn to and his livelihood was cut off. He was about to starve to death and had no choice but to take this path. The police chief, seeing his pitiful condition, ordered the detectives to send him to the Ningbo Fellow-Townsman Association for relief.</p>

<p>Oppose the Hongkou Market's Increased Levy</p>
<p>Letter to the Public Works Department Requesting Withdrawal of Increased Levy</p>
<p>A letter from the Cattle and Sheep Traders Association to the Business Consolidation Association states: "Greetings. Our association is currently opposing the increased rental fee for the Hongkou Small Vegetable Market to the Public Works Department at the request of our members. We have received a notice from Mr. Wei Sishi, the head of the Public Works Department's Health Bureau, stating that from June 1, the rental fee for the Hongkou vegetable stallholders will be increased by one yuan per stall per month, bringing the total rental fee to six yuan per stall, which is unbearable. Furthermore, prices have been rising recently, and the domestic war is severely affecting the market, causing small businesses to be on the verge of collapse. Even without the rent increase, your department already feels overwhelmed. If the rent increase is implemented in June, it will be even more difficult. Therefore, we urge this association to strongly oppose it to the bureau to avoid harsh taxes, etc. The Shanghai market has been sluggish recently, and small businesses are even more unprofitable. The impact of the current situation makes it even more difficult to operate. It has been found that in May of 1923, your bureau increased the rent for the Hongkou Vegetable Market because the market was newly built and required a large amount of money, which was the reason for the rent increase. The vegetable market is still the same vegetable market built that year. Rent was already increased in that year, and there is no reason to increase rent now. In view of the fact that rent cannot be increased for these reasons, please consider the difficulties of the merchants and withdraw the decision to increase rent. All rental items for Hongkou vegetable stalls should be collected as before in order to please the merchants. Today, the group is angry and see the rent increase as a hindrance to business, and we are writing to you especially, requesting that your association write to the Public Works Department's chief and the Health Bureau and the Donation Office to avoid increasing the rent for the vegetable market. Shanghaie Special City Cattle and Sheep Association Permanent Commissioner Chen Guanghai."</p>

When Hong Feng and other stores held the checks to be cashed on the due date, they discovered they were unable to cash out from the ticket seller's store and realized they had been tricked, so they hired lawyer Jin Yu to represent them and reported the case to the French police station. Detective Mao Jinsheng, Gu Mingzhou, etc. arrested Xie, and yesterday they escorted him to the French Public Hall to be interrogated. First, each of the plaintiffs stated the previous situation. Xie Baozhang confessed that the money was entrusted by Zhu Jixin, the owner of the Yuan Xing Sugar Firm, to the merchant to swap with the plaintiffs for cash.

<p>Judgment on the Counterfeit Money Case</p>
<p>Three Criminals Sentenced to Imprisonment Separately</p>
<p>Twelve Counterfeit Banknotes Confiscated</p>
<p>At about 8 am on the morning of the day before yesterday, in Dachang Town, northwest of Wusong, a man wearing a military uniform and two men in plain clothes bought four bars of soap at the Risheng Sundries Store on Che Street. The man in military uniform took out a five-yuan banknote from the Central Bank to pay. The shop clerk recognized it as a counterfeit, so he refused to accept it. The transaction did not take place, and the police on duty nearby noticed and arrested the three men. After a brief interrogation at the police station, they identified themselves as Ye Chunbao, Zhang Guichen, and Wang Guisheng. Eight counterfeit five-yuan banknotes were found in Wang's pocket, and a forged official document and four counterfeit five-yuan banknotes were found on Ye Chunbao. The head of the branch station, Gu Shuxian, determined that the case of using counterfeit money was a criminal case and sent the three criminals to the Baoshan County Public Security Bureau for investigation by the county government. At 1 pm yesterday, Judge Zhang opened the court for interrogation. Ye Chunbao confessed that he was 30 years old, from Shanghai, and a painter. He had been a soldier in the 21st Division. The symbols and uniforms were all worn when he was a soldier. He had now been discharged. As for the origin of the banknotes, he borrowed them from a friend, Yang Guilin, because he was in financial difficulties. Yang gave him 12 five-yuan banknotes, but he did not know whether they were genuine or not. The rest of his confession was evasive. Zhang Guichen was then questioned, and he confessed that he was 22 years old, from Shanghai, and worked as a car dealer. Wang Guisheng was his friend, and he did not know Ye Chunbao. He knew nothing about the use of counterfeit money and begged for mercy. Wang Guisheng was then questioned, and he confessed that he was 16 years old, from Suzhou. Zhang Guichen was his friend, and Yang Guilin gave him the banknotes to use jointly with Zhang Guichen. After reviewing the confessions, Judge Zhang sentenced Ye Chunbao to one year of imprisonment for forging official documents, a fine of two yuan for publicly wearing the uniform of a public official of the Republic of China, and six years of imprisonment for using counterfeit currency, with deprivation of civil rights for six years, to be executed concurrently for a total of six years and two months. Wang Guisheng and Zhang Guichen were each sentenced to six years of imprisonment for jointly using counterfeit currency. The twelve five-yuan banknotes, totaling sixty yuan, and the uniforms and official document symbols were confiscated.</p>

<p>His Wife's Younger Brother is Accused as a Suspect</p>
<p>Zhu Songzhou, who works in political circles, came to Shanghai for official business on the 7th of last month and stayed in Room 52 of the Yipinxiang Hotel. On the evening of the 10th, when Zhu returned to the hotel from outside, he discovered that more than 500 yuan in cash had been stolen. When he asked the waiter, he said that after Zhu went out, Zhu's friend Chen Abing, also known as Zhou Xijun, came to visit and sat alone in Zhu's room. Only after the friend left did Zhu report it to the police and request the Special District Court to issue a warrant for investigation and arrest. Chen Abing surrendered himself to the Zhabei Police Station the day before yesterday. He was escorted to the court yesterday, where Judge Xu interrogated him. According to Zhu's statement, Chen is his wife's younger brother, but they no longer interact due to his improper behavior. That day, taking advantage of his absence, he broke into the room and stole 500 yuan in cash and 2 yuan and 20 jiao in coins, and a coat. He requested that he be interrogated. The waiter No. 9 of the hotel testified that the defendant was indeed left alone in Zhu's room for a long time that day. Chen denied the theft and said that his sister was the plaintiff's lover and that there was a family dispute in this situation. The court ordered the defendant to post bail of 600 yuan and adjourned the hearing for further interrogation.</p>

Around 2:00 AM yesterday, they saw a barge approaching the ship. Subsequently, individuals unloaded two hemp sacks and two cloth sacks from the vessel and loaded them onto the barge, with several armed individuals guarding the operation.

<h3 id="e146">Report on the Trial of the House Collapse Injury Case <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Due to the careless demolition of an old house in the central section of Penglai Road in this city, the adjacent Guodai Building suddenly collapsed, instantly killing thirteen-year-old apprentice Zhang Ada. This tragic incident occurred at 10:00 AM on the 3rd of this month. The local police station detained and sent Huang Yungen, the carpentry foreman, to the District Court for interrogation and detention. It is now known that the case has been prosecuted, and Judge Shao, along with Prosecutor Li, held a trial in the Fifth Court yesterday morning. The defendant, Huang Yungen, hired lawyer Zhu Shuzhen to represent him in court. According to Huang Yungen's testimony, he is thirty-four years old, resides in a sugar lane, and operates under the Huang Yunji construction brand. The Zhu family's house in question, which collapsed on April 12th, belonged to the Education Bureau and was adjacent to the old house being demolished. At the time, they were not demolishing the house; the old house had already been demolished, and they were only removing the adjacent brick wall when the Education Bureau's house suddenly collapsed. He was not present at the scene. He further stated that this type of work was subcontracted to a Mr. Chen. The judge asked if he should have taken precautions for the neighboring house and if there were any dangers when demolishing the wall. Huang replied that because the collapsed house was also a new house, there was no need for support. If it had been an old house, they would have made preparations. When asked how many people were injured or killed, Huang replied that only one apprentice, Zhang Ada, was crushed to death. Zhang Wu, the mother of the deceased, testified that she was thirty-six years old, a local resident living in Nanxiaoshao, Beicaizhen, Pudong. Her son, Ada, was adopted by Huang Yungen as a godson and was learning the trade at Huang's place. The tragic crushing death had nothing to do with Huang, and she requested the judge to show kindness and drop the charges, as Huang was truly wronged. At this point, the defendant's lawyer argued that the defendant carried out all procedures for the construction of this house in accordance with precedents and without any negligence. The responsibility rested with the foreman subcontracted by the Education Bureau for the adjacent house. Although the exterior wall of the collapsed house was ten inches thick, the interior was only five inches thick, and there was no mortar under the wall. Moreover, there were no pillars under the collapsed gatehouse. According to precedents, eight pillars, or at least four, were required. This was unprecedented and requested the court to investigate the facts with the Public Works Bureau and to personally visit the site to clarify the truth. The judge granted the request, ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody, and scheduled a further hearing after investigation.</p>

<p>The American Buick Motor Company, which manages Shanghai Buick, McDermott, Cadillac, LaSalle, and General Motors trucks, was established in December last year by Andi Sheng and Folujieluo. In less than half a year since its establishment, its business has been exceptionally developed, and its service has been very complete, earning the trust of people from all walks of life. The company has long had plans to build its own building, so it was temporarily trading at 4 North Suzhou Road at the beginning. Now, due to the expansion of its business, the original site is not enough, and it has decided to move to 105 Jing'an Temple Road to display vehicles. The repair station has been moved to 358 Haige Road as usual. At a time when business is sluggish, money is tight, and silver is cheap, it is difficult to do business, and all industries are depressed, especially the automobile industry, which is most affected. However, the American Buick Motor Company has been able to develop without regret during the emergency period of business, which is not easy. It can be seen that the two gentlemen of Anfo are highly sensitive to the ability to handle affairs and have rich commercial experience, which is not inferior to their knowledge of machinery. The two gentlemen have always had a reputation in the automobile industry. Now, without worrying about huge capital, they are building new houses themselves. A one-stop plan has not yet been announced, but when the new house is completed in the future, it will be the largest and most modern automobile company.</p>

The matter was reported to the District Court for examination, and a letter was sent to his parents and relatives in Chuansha to come to Shanghai to prepare a coffin and handle the funeral.</p>

After Zhu Xiaohong was detained, Shao Wang moved all the clothes and other items from Zhu Xiaohong's store to her home, causing dissatisfaction among the neighbors, who accused Shao Wang of reporting military arms and taking the opportunity to steal property, obviously framing and slandering and robbing property while taking advantage of the situation. They jointly submitted a public report to the Municipal Public Safety Bureau. Commissioner Yuan was furious after reviewing the report and immediately ordered the Detective Team to investigate and quickly detain Shao Wang and send her to the Judicial Section for strict questioning.

<h3 id="e158">Wife's Charge of Abandonment Not Upheld <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Wang Qian, a 21-year-old Ningbo woman residing at 313 Xinjibang Road, accused her husband, Wang Lianghua, of abuse and abandonment. Yesterday morning, Judge Ge of the Special District District Court held a continued hearing. According to the plaintiff, she married the defendant in September of the 16th year and has not yet had children. At first, they were harmonious, but in February last year, the defendant had an affair, and began to abuse her. She was repeatedly beaten, and the defendant stopped working as a coppersmith. Recently, he even brought his mistress home and forbade her from eating. She had to temporarily return to her mother's house. Wang Lianghua denied the abuse, saying that he repeatedly asked the plaintiff to return, but she refused, and he was still willing to live with her. After arguments by lawyers from both parties, Judge Ge ruled that the charge of abandonment was not established and acquitted Wang Lianghua. The incidental civil suit was dismissed.</p>
<h3 id="e159">The Embarrassing Plight of a Matchmaker <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Not Prepared Sixteen Catties of Meat</p>
<p>Beaten Until His Eyes and Nose Bled</p>
<p>There is a Yang family, from Jiangbei, in front of the Xin Puyu Hall on Guohuo Road, Nanshi, whose daughter is betrothed to the Zhao family, who lives in Zhabei. The wedding was scheduled for yesterday. The day before was the bridal makeup ceremony. According to Jiangbei customs, the groom's family must prepare sixteen catties of pork, ten catties of jellyfish, one catty of dried mussels, and six yuan in cash so that the bride's family can share the meat and vegetables. The cash is used to buy wine. From the day of the bridal makeup, the bride cannot eat or drink. She can only eat two days after the wedding. After eating, she must excrete, but she cannot excrete in her parents' home, nor in the new chamber pot in the husband's home. She must wait until the second day to excrete. So the day before yesterday, the bride slept alone in bed, only eating a few dates to satisfy her hunger. Because she was hungry, she could not take care of the matters of leaving the boudoir at home, and entrusted everything to relatives living with her. Because they have lived in Shanghai for a long time, the groom's family believed that the matter of the sixteen catties of meat in Jiangbei customs could be exempted, so they did not prepare anything. The matchmaker Zhao (the groom's uncle) brought people to the bride's house to pick up the makeup, causing many relatives of the bride to be angry, believing that the groom's family deliberately looked down on the bride's relatives, so they twisted him to the teahouse to reason. The matchmaker was slapped and punched by a group of men and women, and his eyes and nose were bleeding. He refused to go to the police station with the police, but fled for his life. To this day, he does not dare to go to the bride's house again, so he asked someone to act as his agent yesterday. It is a truly amusing story.</p>

<p>Male Corpse Drifts in from the Canal</p>
<p>Hands and Feet Bound with Hemp Rope</p>
<p>Drowned After Being Thrown into the River</p>
<p>A nameless male corpse suddenly drifted into the Yangjia Canal near Qian Langzhong Bridge, Donggou Town, Pudong, on the 6th of the current month. The chief of the Fifth Precinct of the Third District of the Municipal Public Safety Bureau ordered the local bailiff to report to the District Court, which appointed a prosecutor to go to the countryside to examine the corpse. The corpse was wearing a blue cloth jacket and trousers, resembling a worker. There was a slight injury on the left side of the chest, but it was not fatal. Both feet were bound with hemp rope, seemingly due to a worker dispute that angered the perpetrator, who used hemp rope to bind the feet and throw the victim into the river, causing him to drown. The death certificate was filled out, and the bailiff was instructed to temporarily store the body pending the arrest and interrogation of the murderer. However, no family members have claimed the body, so it remains an unsolved case. The District Court believes that because the murderer has not been apprehended, the case cannot be solved, and the dead person will ultimately die with injustice. Therefore, it sent a document to the Municipal Public Safety Bureau yesterday, instructing all districts and teams to urgently apprehend the murderer and investigate the case.</p>

<p>Caught Red-Handed</p>
<p>The Luodian Defense Corps in northwestern Wusong reported at around 11:00 PM the night before last that Qi Haihe, a merchant in the eastern part of the town, had reported the theft of more than 150,000 copper coins and requested an investigation.

<p>The afternoon before yesterday at around 6:00 PM, Wu Wenqing and other petition police officers at the Shenghuo Lung Oil Factory in Caojiadu, northern Shanghai, suddenly spotted a man and a woman near the factory, carrying a suitcase, a basket, and two umbrellas. The woman was crying and refusing to move, while the man was furious and panicked. Because they looked suspicious, they stepped forward to interrogate them. The man was evasive, and the woman was crying even more sadly. They were immediately arrested and sent to the Sixth Precinct Police Station. After Commissioner Ren interrogated them separately, the man claimed his name was Kuang Sanda, 29 years old, from Wuxi, residing at 363 Nanyun Lane, Binlang Road. He was a baker. He was returning to his hometown, but the woman was unwilling to go with him, so there was a dispute on the road. The woman claimed her name was Li Jinmei, 19 years old, from Nanjing, previously residing on Broadway Road. She and Kuang had a brief acquaintance. He was trying to abduct her to sell her elsewhere. The suitcase and basket he was carrying were not hers and she did not know where they came from. She refused to go with him because his behavior was improper. After obtaining the confessions, Commissioner Ren examined the clothes in the suitcase and found that they did not match Kuang's statement. Kuang Sanda was definitely not a good person and was indeed abducting the woman. Yesterday, he prepared an official document and sent it to the General Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Labor and Management Mediation Department Established in Concessions</p>
<p>Second District Party Headquarters Issued Declaration Yesterday</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Second District of the Municipal Government, yesterday, upon hearing that the concession authorities are now planning to organize a labor and management mediation department, deeply believes that this kind of organization infringes upon national sovereignty and has issued a declaration severely opposing it. The declaration states: (omitted above) Upon hearing that the concession authorities in this city are planning to establish a labor and management mediation department to handle labor and management disputes within the concessions, this committee is extremely alarmed. Investigations reveal that the central government has already promulgated handling laws for labor and management disputes, and these have been revised and promulgated once. All labor and management disputes within our country should abide by these laws and be handled by the competent government. No other labor and management mediation or arbitration organizations are allowed to disrupt our national sovereign rights. It is recalled that last July, the Economic Group and the Chamber of Commerce, both controlled by the concession authorities, advocated for the establishment of a labor and management mediation department. However, this was stopped after opposition from the municipal party and government organs, as well as various organizations. Barely a year has passed, and the absurd idea has been revived, attempting to rekindle the ashes and establish this kind of monstrous and incongruous organization. Examining their intentions, it is clear that they merely seek to achieve their sinister and treacherous schemes and consolidate their foundation of aggression. This committee deeply believes that this action directly disregards our national government and undermines our governance. It is hoped that all comrades and compatriots in the city will unite in opposition, uphold national prestige, and protect national sovereignty. This is hereby declared. The Second District Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipal Committee of the Kuomintang of China.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Li Guangyuan Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Li Guangyuan, who worked at the Central Automobile Company on Beile Road in the New Concession, gathered a crowd to cause trouble at the intersection of Kangti Road on March 16th, and threw stones to smash a public bus. Patrol officer number 365 arrived and arrested Li Guangyuan and more than ten others, taking them to the French Concession Court for questioning. The charges were confirmed and the defendants were sentenced to one year in prison as a warning. Because Li Guangyuan appealed the initial judgment, he hired lawyer Fei Xizhen to request a retrial, which was approved by the Chinese and Western officials. The retrial was held yesterday. According to the retrial plaintiff's lawyer, the defendant had always been a law-abiding businessman. On that day, he saw a large number of young men and women shouting slogans in the Kangti Road area. Due to his curiosity, he went out to watch and was mistakenly arrested by the patrol officers. The sentence under Article 157 of the Criminal Law in the initial trial was not applicable. He requested a change and asked for the defendant to be released. Patrol officer 365 stated that he saw Li Guangyuan smashing the bus windows with stones, so he arrested him. The Chinese and Western officials, considering that the defendant was a first-time offender, leniently changed the sentence to six months imprisonment as a warning.</p>

<p>The Philippines took the field first, retreated unfavorably. Zhang Rongan hit the ball and occupied second base, shocking the whole stadium. The Philippine pitcher's face showed panic. Lu Shujie's sacrifice hit allowed Zhang to advance to third base. Feng Yuhe took the field to take the lead. Zhang Rongan flew back to home base and scored the first point. Cai Yunping hit a safe hit and advanced to third base, and Feng also followed him back to home base. Seeing the dangerous situation, the Philippines immediately changed the pitcher, replaced by Shan Dousi. Both sides held each other firmly, and there was no disturbance.</p>

<p>The Chinese pitcher used skillful curve balls, making it difficult for the opposing side to gain any ground in the first four innings. In the fifth inning, the defense was careless, and the Philippines regained one point. In the sixth inning, the Philippines scored another point, but China scored two points. At this time, the situation between the two sides gradually became close. In the seventh inning, the Chinese shortstop made a mistake, and the Philippines ran back two runners.

<p>The Result Was 24-39</p>
<p>Japanese Referees Were Too Unfair</p>
<p>Continuously and Unjustifiably Penalizing Our Chinese Team</p>
<p>(Dispatch from our Tokyo office on the 24th) At 7:00 PM today, the first basketball match was a contest between China and Japan. More than 10,000 spectators sat on the grass. At that time, the cool breeze was gentle, the weather was very good, and all the conditions were very suitable. Almost all of the Chinese cheerleading team also arrived at the venue, because, based on past results, everyone thought that China would easily win. Who knew that the result would be beyond expectations, with a crushing defeat of 24-39. In the first three minutes, our country was penalized four times, allowing Japan to score two points. Later, a Japanese player scored another point. By seven minutes, our Yao Enhan finally made two baskets. However, our athletes, feeling indignant at being repeatedly penalized without reason, lost morale and their fighting spirit was greatly reduced. The basketball match could not be played as desired, and ultimately, the first half ended with the Japanese winning 15-12. In the second half, although they tried to cheer up and fight hard, hoping to reverse the situation, the surrounding shouts were too loud, disrupting the team members. Although several players were replaced, there was no progress, and our team lost again 12-24. In short, the referees in this competition were biased towards the Japanese side, so the Japanese team had the advantage everywhere. Their victory can be said to have been aided by the referees. Such unfair refereeing is really unprecedented for our national athletes. If all the competitions in this Games are like this, not only our team but also the Philippine team will probably have no hope of winning any titles.</p>

We were ashamed to lose to the Philippine team by three points in Shanghai in the past. However, this time the formation of the Japanese team is the most complete ever. We will definitely win glory for the country and avenge our humiliation."</p>

<p>Our Tokyo dispatch on the 24th: At today's opening ceremony, overseas Chinese students organized a cheerleading squad. There were hundreds of people at each venue. They wore red and white hats, had the words "China" pinned to their chests, held national flags, and sang in unison. The sound shook the entire stadium and attracted a lot of attention. In addition, there were many overseas Chinese from Yokohama, Osaka, and Kobe who came to watch the games. The scene of Zhang Boling giving a speech to the Chinese athletes upon arrival in Kobe.</p>

<p>Overseas Chinese Welcome Them Frantically</p>
<p>Male and Female Athletes Are Well-Ordered</p>
<p>(1) Overseas Chinese and Japanese Welcome Them at the Station</p>
<p>After the definite news of our country's athletes' arrival in Tokyo reached Tokyo, various groups in Tokyo immediately prepared for the welcome and other matters. On the morning of the 18th, Tokyo Station was filled with our country's male and female students, reaching a total of five or six hundred people. In particular, several thousand officer cadets, in military uniforms and swords, walked around, making the atmosphere tense and dignified. In addition, there were over ten business and overseas Chinese compatriots, embellishing the whole group, which was an unprecedented grand occasion. On the Japanese side, in addition to the president of the Sports Association, Kishii Seiichi, and members of various departments, there was also the founder of the Far Eastern Games, a Miss Blanc, secretary of the Japan Young Men's Association, who came to greet them.</p>
<p>(2) After Exchanging Greetings, They Depart for Their Dormitories At 9:28 AM, over 150 athletes from our country arrived at the station amidst cheers under the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun. The athletes all looked very satisfied and lively, showing no signs of fatigue from the long journey. They were all wearing white flannel uniforms, with eye-catching badges on their chests. Staff members and athletes exchanged greetings with the welcomers for half an hour, then gathered in front of the station and boarded cars to their residences (female athletes stayed at the YWCA, male athletes stayed at the Japan Youth Hall).</p>

<p>(3) Male and Female Athletes Are Surrounded</p>
<p>After the cars arrived at the station, the welcomers surrounded them. Liu Changchun, Lin Baohua, Sun Guiyun, and the Five Tiger Generals of Nankai, who were most noticed by the Chinese people, seemed to regret not knowing each other sooner. Mr. Liu Changchun looked rather tired due to the unfamiliar journey and the unhealed foot injury, and told his friends that he could not participate in the 100-meter race this time, which was a deep pity for those who heard it. Mr. Lin and Qiu Fei were inseparable. Both gentlemen looked very energetic. The Five Tigers of Nankai were surrounded by Nankai students studying in Japan. Those who saw it suspected that they were exclusively owned and did not dare to inquire. Although Ms. Sun Guiyun was slightly darker and thinner than before, she was still lively. When she was leaving the station, she repeatedly used her most quickly learned Japanese phrase "Sayonara" (goodbye) to bid farewell to the welcomers, making people feel late for meeting and regretful for the hasty parting.</p>
<h3 id="e216">(4) Mr. Xu Zhendong Takes Good Care of Everything <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Lu Zhongen, a famous basketball player from Shanghai, was also the focus of attention. Mr. Lu, carrying a "Remington" typewriter, stood side by side with his girlfriend, as if he had great feelings about the revitalized new Tokyo, which could not be expressed in a few words. In addition, a certain gentleman, in addition to carrying his luggage, held up a birdcage, and the bird chirped softly, as if it was pre-celebrating the victory for its owner. Secretary Xu Zhendong was extremely active, running around everywhere, his feet never stopping, distributing tickets when the team members' cars departed. He was worthy of the name "backbone", and had already become an old Tokyoite from old Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e217">(5) Baseball Team Members Take the Lead <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>When the entire team left the station, the women's team led the way, followed by the baseball team. When the general Hawaiian athletes were at their most high-spirited, a command to stop the men's team suddenly came like a thunderclap. Seeing a wide road ahead, our baseball athletes actually performed their "base stealing" stunt, still allowing the women's team to move forward. The onlookers praised the athletes' superb skills and believed that the Japanese army could be defeated in the near future, and cheered endlessly.</p>
<h3 id="e218">(6) Chinese Athletes Are Well-Ordered <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Overall, the spirit and order of our country's athletes upon arrival in Tokyo were far superior to those of the Philippine athletes. The Philippine athletes' clothing was messy, and their actions were unruly, no different from a disorderly rabble. Therefore, the Japanese people praised our country very much.</p>
<h3 id="e219">(7) Ms. Gao Zi Changes Route to Arrive in Tokyo <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Gao Zi, the wife of the women's team's instructor Hao Gengsheng, changed her route to come to Japan by train through Liaoning because she was not used to traveling by sea. That day, the female team members went to the YWCA with the help of Mr. Hao Boyang. Mr. Hao Gengsheng had already telegraphed Tokyo, entrusting the Chinese YMCA to take care of everything for his wife. It is said that she will arrive in Tokyo at 8:30 AM on the 21st.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau sent a letter to the Public Concession Ratepayers Association requesting assistance in the matter of recovering educational rights in the concessions. The reply from the association states: "In reply to your Bureau's letter No. 741 and the declaration on the recovery of educational rights in the concessions, we have read it carefully. The righteousness of the words is solemn and all Chinese people agree. Now, the recovery of the concessions has been listed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as an important task for this year and a special committee has been organized to plan it. If it can be realized as soon as possible, then all sovereignty will be fully recovered and fundamentally resolved. Our colleagues in this association are willing to make the greatest efforts to achieve this final goal. Before this is achieved, our association, organized by the Chinese citizens within the concessions, will spare no effort to do anything that is beneficial to the Chinese citizens. Education is a major plan for cultivating talents and is of particular importance. When the Chinese directors joined the Municipal Council in March of the 17th year, the first session of the representative conference decided on the proposals regarding the educational problems in the Public Concession, which were: 'The Chinese Education Committee must be organized by Chinese people as a principle, and the Chinese education expenses must be based on 20% of the tax revenue as a standard.' This association formally sent a letter to the board of directors of the Public Concession Municipal Council expressing its attitude. For the past three years, the Chinese directors and Chinese committee members have all been able to follow the resolutions of the representative conference and strive to expand Chinese education expenses within the possible range to suit the increase in schools for Chinese children, and have paid close attention to the management of Chinese educational rights. Although the principles and standards decided by the representative conference still require effort, we dare not slacken in the face of difficulties, and we dare not be complacent and forget the final goal. We have not neglected this matter in the slightest. As for the running dog race clubs and other places that harm customs, this association has criticized them all. The circumstances have been reviewed by the party. We are encouraged to renew our efforts, and this association will strive even harder to support them. This is addressed to the Director of the Shanghai Special Municipal Education Bureau, Chen, from the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association.</p>

<p>After the wave of resignations and demands for back pay by teachers in Suzhou, the city school principals also followed suit. As the crisis escalated, it became even more difficult to manage. The principal's appointment letter has been returned by the Education Bureau and a letter of consolation has been sent. Regarding the arrears, it is promised to pay one month's salary first, but the principal's opinion is to require the payment of two months' salary. The teachers, after demanding salary from Director Wu Guanghan of the Bureau all night the day before yesterday, went to the County Education Bureau again yesterday morning. The bureau locked the door and turned them away. The teachers have now stated that the Education Bureau has no responsible representation, and that the bureau door was locked during office hours, so they have formally filed an administrative lawsuit with the Education Department. County Magistrate Huang Yunchen convened representatives of the principals last night to discuss a solution.</p>

<p>The art of national martial arts is originally our country's specialty. Those who are particularly skilled often keep their skills secret and do not pass them on to others, resulting in a gradual decline. Now the government is promoting national martial arts and has set up special halls. From now on, the disciples of Wudang and Shaolin will have successors. Recently, I saw an anecdote recorded by the Old Man Juan Shi, which is extremely interesting. I quickly recorded it to share with readers. Mr. Zou Jingfu of Wuxi, named An Chang, was honest and upright. He studied books in his youth, and was skilled in playing the qin, calligraphy, and painting. His paintings resembled Wen Hengshan, and his calligraphy followed the style of Mi Fei. He was also proficient in arithmetic and understood Tianyuan Siyuan. In his later years, he called himself Weng, which meant borrowing one "yi" of books and returning one "yi" of books. He was thin and tall, and gentle and refined. Those who saw him did not know that he was skilled in martial arts. During the Taiping Rebellion, Mr. Zou was old. He took refuge in a certain town in the northwest of the county (seemingly Mount Hou). It faced water and was backed by mountains, with a bridge as the only passage. The place was remote and the population was quite large. One day, bandits suddenly arrived, and the whole town was shocked. Women were all crying. Mr. Zou said, "Don't be disturbed for now. Let me observe them. If those who come do not have firearms, there may still be a strategy to resist them." There was a willow tree in the square, about three zhang tall. Mr. Zou leaped to the top of it and looked around for a moment. He flew down and had a happy expression. He said to the crowd, "No harm done. The responsibility lies with this old man." He wanted a weapon. Someone presented him with a broadsword, which Mr. Zou broke like a broken gourd. He said, "This is useless." Several men carried an iron bar weighing over a hundred catties. Mr. Zou refused it and said, "Why use this to play with rats?" Suddenly, he saw a floor-scrubbing brush in the corner of the house. Its handle was made of white waxwood. It was like a half-section spear of Geshu. He smiled and said, "This is enough." He took it and removed the cloth strands, and took it out. There was a toilet on the road. He put the end of the pole in and soaked it. He came out and ground it in the soil so that it would not drip. He slowly walked to the other side of the bridge. After a while, the bandits arrived and shouted, "Old man, are you not afraid of death?" Mr. Zou slowly replied, "Rats jumping around, what a shame. If you want to cross this bridge, why not kill this old man?" The bandits were angry and thrust their spears forward. Mr. Zou raised the pole and made a circular motion. All the spears slipped from their hands and flew away. The bandits were even more angry and attacked with their blades. Mr. Zou calmly waved the pole, rotating it among the crowd. Before long, the bandits were all vomiting madly and fled. When waving the pole, he wiped the mouths of the bandits with the filthy end. The village was saved.</p>

<p>An official in Wu County had fine peonies in his back garden. It was said that his family had moved them from Luoyang when he was an official there many years ago. Wei Purple and Yao Yellow, the most famous varieties. When they bloomed, guests came to admire them, and banquets were held. Everyone praised them, and some asked for cuttings. Even good friends were refused. A certain notable attempted to bribe the gardener, but the gardener declined, saying that the master's precautions were strict and there was no way to arrange it. Over time, people became jealous. A neighbor named Yang had a guest named Qian, who was extremely resourceful. Qian said to Yang, "Do you want to get the peonies from that official? I see that the flowers are lush and close to the garden wall, and the roots are likely to be growing under the wall and into your property, which is separated by only a wall. We can perform a procedure to lead the roots to your land. After a year or two, you will have a fine variety of this famous flower." Yang was delighted and asked how to perform the procedure. Qian said, "Determine the location where the flower roots are. Dig a small hole several feet deep and place pig intestines as fertilizer in the hole. Then fill the hole with soil again. The roots will gradually grow out from the fertilized area. To make peonies thrive, you don't need to fertilize with human waste; you must use pig intestines. This was indeed done. Around the vernal equinox, tender shoots emerged. A Tang Dynasty poem said, 'Green willows are suitable for making spring for two families.' Now it can be said that peonies are suitable for making spring for two families, as the roots emerge from under the garden wall." It was already winter, and this was done according to the method. The next year, there was no sign of anything. Qian said, "This method can be used again this winter, and it will definitely be effective." The following year, peony shoots from the neighboring garden sprouted out near the wall. Therefore, extra care was taken in nurturing them. After three years, they flourished. The flowers were as large as those in the neighboring garden. The owner of the neighboring garden invited people to admire the famous flowers. Yang also participated. As the banquet was about to end, Yang invited all the guests and the host, saying, "Tomorrow, I will honor you all with a visit to my garden to admire the peonies." Upon arrival, they saw that they were no different from the neighboring flowers. Everyone asked where they came from. The owner of the neighboring garden was particularly surprised. Yang smiled and said to the owner of the neighboring garden, "The famous flowers in your garden have revealed their spring splendor." He then told them about the root grafting method. The official changed a Song Dynasty poem to jest, "The spring colors fill the garden and cannot be contained; a branch comes out from under the wall." Everyone applauded and laughed.</p>

<p>My neighbor's son, surnamed Yu, was extremely dull. People commonly called him a "stupid ox." He would sometimes chirpily respond. Learning crafts and engaging in commerce, he was unable to complete any task. In the thirteenth year of the Republic, he went to Guangdong to live with his uncle. He disappeared in Guangdong in less than a month. For six or seven years, searches were conducted everywhere, but there were no signs. Everyone said that he was more likely to be dead than alive. Who knew that a month ago, this missing "stupid ox" had leisurely returned home? Everyone was astonished and quickly inquired about his whereabouts. According to the "ox," he had nothing to do at his uncle's place in Guangdong and spent his days wandering the streets. One day, he met a man on Jianglan Street. The man was luxuriously dressed and acted generously. Seeing him idly walking down the street, he used asking for directions as an excuse to exchange surnames and origins, including his clan and place of residence. The "ox" answered everything without hesitation. The man introduced himself as Qian Zaidong, a comprador on a certain ship with many workers under him. The "ox," feeling frustrated and looking for work, disregarded the potential dangers and pleaded for help. Qian agreed to arrange a position for him on the ship, with a certain amount of salary each month. He warned him not to reveal this opportunity to others to avoid being preempted. The "ox" respectfully agreed. They arranged to meet again at a teahouse the next day to discuss the matter further. The "ox" went as agreed, and Qian was already there. Qian said that the matter had been settled, but the ship was urgently sailing that day. If he wanted the job, he might as well board the ship with him right away. All his belongings could be taken care of after boarding. The "ox" was overjoyed, thinking that he was lucky to have met such a good person in this degenerate era. His gratitude was indescribable. He boarded a large ship with Qian. Qian told the "ox" to stay in the cabin and not come out. After some time, the ropes were untied, and the ship sailed. The "ox" searched everywhere for Qian but could not find him, which made him uneasy. At mealtime, he was called to eat by a ship worker. The ship sailed for a day and a night and arrived at a deserted island. The "ox" was driven ashore by a worker. The "ox" tried to reason and inquire, but he saw five or six people resembling workers on the shore, who seized him and dragged him into a mine. Despite shouting and screaming, no one helped him. From then on, he lived in darkness, living the life of a beast of burden. The supervisors were extremely cruel, and whipping was applied for the slightest rest. The suffering was unbearable. He thought of escaping, but there was no way out. He believed he would die in this mine. Unexpectedly, last year, during construction in the mine, the ore exploded, destroying the entire mine. Eight or nine out of ten workers were killed or injured, but the "ox" only suffered minor injuries. Four or five days after the mine explosion, a large ship came to the island to take away the surviving workers. The "ox" was among them. When the ship arrived in Hong Kong, although there was still supervision, the "ox" seized an opportunity and escaped, bearing his injuries. He begged his way to Guangdong and reached his uncle's place. He was given money to return home. He spoke with lingering fear. I have heard that there are gangs in Guangdong that sell coolies. The "ox" likely encountered one of them. I record this to warn young people who go to Guangdong.</p>

<p>Fahua Mountain is located in Qinlü Township, on the main road to Liuxia Town. The beauty of West Lake converges here, so the area produces many mao bamboo. The shoots cast shadows, and the sound of their husks splitting can be heard. At the first spring thunder, bamboo shoots burst forth vigorously. However, mao bamboo shoots need to sprout in late spring. Villagers dig in the soil to find and cut them. They are no more than a foot long and are seasoned with Wu salt, making them tender and delicious. Even Su Dongpo's jade-like meditation food would have to take a back seat.</p>
<p>Mao bamboo shoots are also called cat bamboo shoots or cat's head bamboo shoots because their tips are pointed like cat ears. The counties of Yuhang, Lin'an, and Anji Xiaofeng near Hangzhou have dense bamboo forests and are major production areas. However, their shoots are either peeled of their outer skin, called bamboo shoot skin, or flattened and baked, called dried bamboo shoots. Their taste is inferior to those of Fahua. However, the ones produced in Fahua are best when they are first dug from the mountain. If they are transported overnight in baskets to the city, the husks will be dry and the flesh coarse, greatly diminishing their quality.</p>
<p>Fahua has an East Yue Temple. The temple has many Taoist priests who cultivate many bamboo mountains. If they are sent out with hoes and return with baskets, with the length and weight being just right, and with the aroma still lingering, paired with Lǐ'ān's [chef] dishes and the water shield soup from the Three Pools, the kitchen in the temple will have a flavor different from the mountain home. A word to meat-eaters: why not try it?</p>
<p>Short News 1: The female pirate protagonist, Pauline Stark, disliked her native clothes, which were not very comfortable. So she made a set of Chinese clothes, modeled after the palace attire of noble women of the Qing Dynasty. The upper garment was made of crepe and embroidered with Chinese characters.

Pauline deeply believed that this kind of clothing was ten thousand times better than Western clothes. She once said, "This dress is both beautiful and comfortable. I believe that among all kinds of clothes, this kind is the best." She wore this outfit several times in the "Female Pirate" film, which is currently showing at the Paris Opera House.</p>

<p>When we write in a sloping or slanting way, if we are not careful, the ink easily stains our clothes. If it is a new stain that is not dry, we should quickly use blotting paper to surround the stain and twist it tightly to absorb the ink. Then, take a soft cloth and dip it in a little tomato juice. Apply it from the edge to the center. Let it sit for a few minutes, then wash it off. If traces still appear, repeat the above method until it is completely clean.</p>
<p>If the ink stain has been there for a long time, the removal process is more troublesome. You can buy some oxalic acid from the pharmacy and dissolve it in water. The ratio of water to acid should be twelve to one. For stains on white clothes, use boiling water. For colored clothes, warm water is sufficient. After the water and acid have dissolved, take a soft cloth, soak it in the solution, and scrub the stain vigorously. It should gradually become clean. However, the original color of the clothes will inevitably be slightly affected. You can mix one part vinegar with twelve parts cold water and soak the clothes in the mixture to restore their original luster.</p>

<p>Chapter 11: Emerald Net and Pearl Hairpins, a Beauty Marries a Handsome Man; Green Chamber and Crimson Canopy, a Famous Courtesan Marries into a Notable Family</p>
<p>Zuo Shichen thought secretly, "...Star Uncle's wife... has always been known for her beauty... She is a woman of both talent and beauty... I remember that in that girls' school... she was known as the queen of the whole school... The position of emperor in the world can be abolished... but the name of queen is hard to remove..." As the saying goes, "Hot porridge is difficult to make into a dish, and a beautiful wife is difficult to make into a husband"... This saying has a lot of profound meaning... It's just a pity that Liu Xing Uncle's physique is not very healthy... and cannot help but give him cause for concern... But this is something that he is happy about... and said, "I also agree with you... to use the rewards gained from your hard work... to gain one or two commemorative precious items... to wear on your loved one's body... what a pleasant and comforting thing that is..." Liu Xing Uncle listened very contentedly and said, "I am of this principle... Achievement is of this principle... Yesterday one of our relatives... he runs a jewelry store on Sanma Road... had two items... he persuaded me to buy... He said they were brought by a Nanyang merchant... Because there are other business matters... these two items can be sold without making money from others... Sold at cost... Two items... actually sold for one thousand two hundred dollars... For them who do jewelry business... this is just a small transaction..." Zuo Shichen asked him, "What are these two items?" Liu Xing Uncle said, "A jadeite necklace... to be sold for seven hundred dollars... Originally this kind of thing... is sold to foreign firms... foreign women... their clothes have no collars... to show off their white necks... so they often wear various necklaces... of course, the most luxurious... a string of perfectly round pearl necklaces... valued at tens of thousands... or even hundreds of thousands... Next is jadeite... but color and size... have a great relationship... However, Western women especially like jadeite necklaces... because the beads blend with the flesh tone... a string of green jadeite adorns a snow-white neck... how beautiful is that..." Because foreign women like to wear necklaces... if they don't have precious ones... they wear coral or amber necklaces... the lowest kind... are fake... But they told me... jadeite is sure to become very expensive in the future... The price this year... and the price of previous years is very different... This string of jadeite necklaces... is because it was brought by a guest from Nanyang... he still priced it in Nanyang... Nanyang is the concentration of jadeite... and he declared that he would not make money on it... seven hundred dollars is really not expensive... The other is a beaded phoenix... the beads are not very big... but small and round... the brilliance is also very good... that beaded phoenix is priced at five hundred dollars... the two items... belong to one person... they are both from that Nanyang guest... his intention is to sell the two items... together... if you only want one of them... he will have to add to this price..." My relative... he advised me to buy both items together... He said that jadeite gets more expensive every year... If you don't like it... after another three years... at least this string of jadeite necklaces... will be worth one thousand dollars..."</p>

<p>(Beijing) The opening price of spot 96 in the previous session was 16.15, the low was 16.05, the high was 16.225, and the closing price was 16.175. 275,000 were sold.

<h3 id="e240">Demobilization and Troop Reduction Continue to Rise Sharply <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions for various bond markets in Shanghai: For spot goods, except for the 11,000 yuan worth of demobilization bonds and the 6,500 yuan of fully paid 6% bonds, there were no other transactions. The futures market had approximately 5,000,000 in the morning sessions. The later market was calm with only 3,560,000. The total was over 8,600,000 yuan. The changes in the prices of various bonds: the rising trend of demobilization and troop reduction has not weakened slightly. Buyers on the market are very active, rebounding by about 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan. This is because there is extremely little circulation of spot goods on the market, and investors are very interested in buying, so the supply and demand situation is very disparate. As for the others, because the prices are already very high, they remain in a revolving state and have not seen any major changes.</p>

<p>Guangdong and Yunnan Merchants Continue to Purchase Vigorously...Additional 5,000+ Bales</p>
<p>The yarn market remains robust, with a tight situation. This is largely due to the continued purchases by Guangdong merchants, boosting market sentiment. Yunnan merchants are also following suit, further tightening the market. Many small players are selling out, but major players remain calm. One major mill, seeing strong spot demand, is particularly confident. In the afternoon, they increased their position by 400 bales for this month, and shipped 1,500 bales of unsold 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd brand yarn to Guangdong for sale. Currently, a significant amount of spot yarn has been sold. With the release of domestic goods from various mills, a temporary price decline is unlikely.</p>
<p>Morning Decline, Afternoon Rise in Human Standard Forward Yarn Market. Trading Opened with Slight Weakness in American Cotton and a Drop in Third-Grade Yarn. Due to Unfavorable Current Events, a Major Bull Closed Their Position, Leading to a Flat Market. Prices for each month fell by only 1, 2, or 3 cents. In the afternoon, news of strong spot yarn sales in Guangdong boosted market sentiment. Bulls sold off 1,500 bales of unsold inventory, causing a surge in buying. Prices for each month rose by 5, 7, 8, or 9 cents. However, Guangdong bulls sold off for profit. The total daily volume traded was 15,700 bales. The closing prices for Human Standard are recorded below:</p>
<p>Human Standard Closing Prices: Price Change, Outstanding Balance</p>
<p>August: 15.49, Up 5, 22,800</p>

<p>July: 15.46, Up 5, 25,200</p>
<p>Guangdong Merchants' Interest in Spot Yarn Remains Strong, Sales Continue to be Smooth. Total purchases by various merchants amounted to 6,430 bales, with fellow merchants taking in 155 bales. Prices rose by 5.5 cents. Most purchases by out-of-town merchants were from Guangdong merchants, totaling 4,260 bales. In addition, 140 bales went to Xiamen, 130 bales to the mainland, 840 bales to Yunnan, 380 bales to Sichuan, 125 bales to Ningbo, 90 bales to Shantou, 300 bales to Qianzhuang, 50 bales to Wuhu, 35 bales to Tianjin, and 80 bales to miscellaneous merchants.

<p>The cotton market remains firm, showing a strong upward trend. American cotton conditions are flat, but the local market remains tight due to tightening by Han merchants. They are also increasing their forward purchases, making it difficult for the market to loosen. However, spot cotton sales are quiet, with mills halting purchases. One mill is even shorting a large quantity of far-month contracts.</p>
<p>Human Standard Pulled Up by the Yarn Market in the Afternoon. Futures Cotton Opened Flat in the Morning. Prices fell by 1 cent to 0.5 cent due to the lack of an increase in American cotton and selling by small players. In the afternoon, the yarn market surged, pulling up the cotton market. The situation suddenly turned firm, with prices rising by 0.5 cent to 2.5 cents. The total daily volume traded was 19,100 piculs. The closing prices for Han Standard are recorded below:</p>
<p>Han Standard Closing Prices: Price Change, Outstanding Balance</p>

<p>New York, May 23rd, reports on the cotton market for the week: At the beginning of the week, the cotton market rose due to wind and storm damage to new cotton in the West and Central regions. However, it soon fell back as the weather turned sunny. Shorts bought in when the July futures price fell back. The position of the new cotton will become more active as the season progresses. The West and Central regions have been significantly damaged by excessive rainfall, and will likely need to be replanted. However, the rain in the East has been beneficial. Cotton fields in Georgia, Mitchell, Shelby Basin, and Texas have weeds, except for in the West and Northwest. However, labor and seeds in these states are sufficient for replanting. The weather has been poor this month, so many people have sold new cotton. However, the poor conditions before June are expected to recover, and good soil will allow new cotton to grow quickly next month.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silk market in Shanghai saw a gradual improvement. Overseas silk telegrams continued to be forwarded to Shanghai, American sales were initiated, and European firms also started to purchase. The market sentiment was firm. Yesterday, Qianli and other firms traded 90 bales of June Shanghai White Factory Silk (new and old combined). Prices were firm.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Hangzhou Area New Cocoons not Cheap <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>In Hangzhou's Linping, Yuhang, Xucun, Gongchen Bridge, and other areas, cocoon exchanges have been open for more than two weeks. This year, Hangzhou cocoons are more abundant, with each exchange receiving more than last year. Recently, the amount of goods arriving on the market has become increasingly scarce, and the cocoon market is ending. Most cocoon exchanges have stopped weighing. The highest cocoon price is 82 yuan (improved variety, superior cocoons), the lowest is 56 yuan, and the average price must be 66 or 67 yuan.</p>

<p>Qimen black tea continued to be popular yesterday. Jardine Matheson, Jinlong, and other firms showed strong interest in goods with good leaf quality. Total city-wide volume traded was over 1,200 chests, with top-tier tea opening at 210 taels. The good conditions in the high-end tea market have reached their peak. However, the overall tea market remains sluggish. Although new samples of Tunxi and Shexian Zhenmei tea were released yesterday, foreign firms did not value them, and the inland prices were very high, resulting in a pessimistic outlook for the new openings.</p>
<h3 id="e250">Grain Rice Market Downriver Sales Stagnant and Lacking Vigor <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>White Jing, High Quality Fixed, Secondary Falls, Bian Yuan Also Declines</p>
<p>The amount of goods arriving at Zhabei yesterday was still sparse, with around 80 boats in the river. Market sales were very sluggish. Northern Jiangsu high-quality japonica rice barely maintained its original price, with prices around 21 yuan in the inner area. There was no apparent increase or decrease in the surface prices of medium-quality rice, but buyers actually had to reduce prices by nearly 10 cents. In addition, no one inquired about aged japonica rice priced below 19 yuan, further weakening transactions. Currently, northern and southern Jiangsu Pingmi rice are being sold by various stores on behalf of the suppliers, so the future of the japonica market is unlikely to recover. Thin indica rice sales are sluggish, and arrivals are also infrequent. Prices are stable. Sheep's Du and Pointed rice shipments are very small. A few boats carrying this product arrived in port in the past two days. Sales of this product are not smooth, but because the base is solid, the overall price is still set at 18 yuan and 56 cents for ordinary goods. Bian Yuan continues to be seen, but buying interest is declining, and prices are falling steadily. The market fell another 10 cents yesterday, showing a lack of vigor.</p>
<p>More than ten boats arrived at the South Shanghai West Road and South Road. Sales on this street are flat. There is still some Changshu and Wuxi high-quality japonica rice being sold in small quantities. Prices remain high at 20 yuan, but the market is neither prosperous nor declining. Suzhou Tongli and other machine-milled japonica rice are being procured by rural villages, so the market is stable. However, all transactions are small and scattered. Wholesale goods are stagnant because Chongming, Tongzhou, and Haizhou merchants are taking a wait-and-see approach. Sales of early-season thin indica rice in South Road focus on high-quality rice. It is difficult for ordinary secondary goods to develop. Moreover, sources are closer than others, and the market is softening by nearly a foot. Sheep's Du and Pointed rice have recently arrived in port and are more popular than in the North City. Sales are also not weak. However, the unstable prices of imported rice currently affect this rice, and prices are sometimes reduced. Ordinary goods are priced around 18 yuan, and the arrival of Bian Yuan is very small. Interest is slightly moving, but the overall price is slightly lower due to poor conditions in Zhabei.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Recent Flour Squeezed to 60 Cents Outside the Customs <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>Forward contracts have all fallen back</p>
<p>The flour market suddenly showed signs of chaos yesterday. Due to the transition between old and new wheat this month, and the unwillingness of manufacturers to maintain prices, manipulators took advantage of the situation, repeatedly squeezing shorts and raising prices. Yesterday, the market saw bulls not only unwilling to loosen their grip, but also increasing prices and buying in, so the highest price squeezed to 2 taels, 6 qian, 0 li and 7.5 hao. This exceeded the bull's target of 60 cents. Compared to yesterday's closing price, it rose by 3 cents for no reason. When the near-term prices were at their highest, the prices of forward contracts also rose. However, later, because the weather was very good, with plenty of sunshine, inland bulls sold off one after another. All contracts from June onwards saw a decline. If the weather continues to be good during the wheat harvest, and the annual food supply is stably harvested, then the sentiment will not be as strong as it is now, and the opportunity for the market to fall back should begin. As a result, this month's price rose by 2 fen and 2 li and 5 hao compared to before. June to August contracts fell by 7 li and 5 hao, and September and October contracts each fell by 1 fen and 2 li and 5 hao.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Wheat Market Shows Slightly Softening Signs <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market generally showed flat and weak signs. Because the weather is good and the price of imported wheat is also slightly lower by 2, 3, 5, or 60 cents, the market sentiment is weak. However, the key to this will be the weather at the time of the new wheat harvest. If the weather is good and the annual food supply is stably harvested, then the sentiment will not be as strong and unyielding as it is now. As a result, June, July, and October contracts each fell slightly by 1 fen compared to the previous day, and August and October contracts remained unchanged. Arrivals of spot wheat have been light, and the mills are neither too close nor too far. Given the recent tight flour situation, spot goods can temporarily hold steady. However, as the new wheat season approaches, the mills will relax their grip, and old goods will have to be discounted. A shipment of Xuzhou wheat, Suzhou wheat, and Qingjiangpu wheat, medium to good quality, opened at 5 taels and 1 qian, and high-quality goods opened at 5 taels and 1 qian and 5 fen, totaling 2,000 bags, and were purchased by Fuxin.</p>
<h3 id="e253">New Rapeseed Vigorously Purchased by Foreign Firms <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>This year's new rapeseed crop is better than in previous years. Various producing areas have been shipping to Shanghai one after another, so foreign firms are gradually paying attention. Currently, shipments arriving in Shanghai include Hankou, Jiujiang, Wenzhou, and Taizhou goods. Among them, Wenzhou goods are the most numerous, and the rest are small shipments. Initial sales in Shanghai were only slightly active on this street. Due to the lack of a formal market price, foreign firms vigorously purchased yesterday, buying 500 bags of Wenzhou goods for 2 years at a price of 6 taels, 1 qian, and 8 fen.</p>

<p>Those who study biology value the collection of specimens first, and then research can be verified and progress made. Therefore, researchers in Europe and the United States spend years collecting specimens, traveling around the world, and their spirit is admirable. Therefore, they must make contributions every year to help the world evolve. For example, on the question of "whether humans evolved from apes," they have collected specimens. The Department of Biology of Jinan University, in view of this, has specially organized a specimen collection group to depart for North China, and then to the Northwest and Northeast. The scope of the collection is quite large, including all stone age human, monkey and animal skulls, and the strange animals and plants of each region are included. The deadline is set for September. Earlier, the president of the school submitted a request to the National Government to order protection in various provinces, so there is absolutely no danger to the safety of the group. The group was originally scheduled to depart last month, but was delayed until now due to funding issues. It was only recently that the school authorities provided a large amount of funding to make the trip possible. The group is divided into two departments: the Guidance Department, with Li Guochang as the general director, Professors Gao Zhongkui and Xu Renji as plant guides, Liu Zengyao and Huang Nong as animal guides, and Li Xiqi and two technicians as managers; and the Affairs Department, with Cai Guoping, Zhang Hanwen, Huang Guoping, Lin Yaoting, Liao Chunhua, and student Huang Bingquan as members. The collection subgroups are assigned temporarily. This is the first time that the school has opened a Chinese biological collection group, and the results will be remarkable in the future. It is hoped that other universities can learn from the school and that all departments should have practical experiments. (Wubujing)</p>

<p>Act Two of The Merchant of Venice</p>
<h3 id="e260">After Seeing "The Merchant of Venice" · Zheng · Yong <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>The long-awaited "Merchant of Venice" finally premiered on the 17th.</p>
<p>The Drama Association's performance of "The Merchant of Venice" this time, had been in preparation for several months. The very long play has more than thirty actors, so it must be said that the arrangement and the number of actors presented difficulties. The result of this performance is that the performance on stage and the plot in the book are about the same. The actors also achieved considerable proficiency. This is admirable and cannot be denied as progress.</p>
<p>The entire play of "The Merchant of Venice" is divided into five acts. The main characters in these five acts are Portia, Bassanio, Antonio, Shylock, and his daughter Jessica. The status of each protagonist, the personality of each person, the tone of voice when speaking, and the attitude of showing joy and sorrow, must each be appropriate, so that no one is slightly deficient. This will ultimately bring the entire "Merchant of Venice" from the script to the stage to vividly express it. Although the actors who played these few people were passable, the one who left the deepest impression on the audience was Shen Tongjun as Shylock, who fully manifested his cunning and cruel nature, bringing misfortune to others and misfortune to himself. However, Shylock's frantic expression when he searched everywhere for his daughter Jessica after she eloped should not be too busy and agitated. The sound of calling his daughter should be implicit, sad, and breathless. Also, Shylock's stubborn and vicious attitude towards the inquisitor in the Venetian court in the first scene of the fourth act, expressing his anger and wanting to vent his inner hatred, the only thing is revenge on Antonio, and the posture of cutting a pound of flesh and the trembling language, are very vivid. It can be said that this is the most outstanding part of the entire play.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Yimei, who played Antonio, was also able to portray the loyalty of a merchant to his friend Bassanio, but his movements were a bit slow. However, in terms of the plot, it was not very inferior.</p>
<p>Miss Portia's beautiful appearance, in Yu Xiuyun,</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>May 25, 1930 (Shen Bao Local Supplement) Sunday (6)</p>
<p>The lady's clever figure, clear and white face, and very clear voice are very appropriate. Her graceful posture and dignified aristocratic demeanor are especially praised by the audience. Ms. Yu is indeed an important and indispensable role in the play.</p>
<p>Regarding the scenery, too much precious time was spent, because the scenery was too slow, causing the audience to be unable to maintain the patience of keeping quiet, causing the audience to make noise and talk, thus destroying the silent atmosphere in the performance hall, or some meaningless arbitrary coughs and sputum sounds. (If the curtain opens quickly, there will naturally be fewer of these phenomena.) As for the scene in Portia's house in the second act, the arrangement is not very good, and it will change into something like a civilized play in the Great World. In other words, the furnishings in Portia's house must be rich and beautiful, but they must not be too close to vulgarity, or even get too bad. Because of too much attention to realism, it becomes complicated and inelegant. The scenery set in the garden of Portia's house at the end of the play is still quite appropriate. The green shade forest is really not easy to make well on the stage. It is a pity that the color brought by the lights is too heavy, and the green does not look like the bright silver light at night. This point seems to be more appropriate to use blue, and the color should be lighter. Although these are very small things, for the sake of perfection, I can't help but nitpick. But the light and shadow in the previous acts have to be said to be very appropriate. There is also one thing that is very satisfactory, that is, everyone in the audience this time was very able to strictly maintain order, which is a rare quietness compared to the usual performances in the drama club. It seems that the artistic skills on the stage can very much stimulate the audience's brains.</p>
<p>The fourth act of "The Merchant of Venice"</p>
<h3 id="e261">Physical Education of Guanghua Female Students <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>The physical education of Guanghua female students is very immature, because since the enrollment of female students, the number of days has been very small, and the various facilities are not yet complete. Most of the female students, in addition to attending classes every day, are neatly dressed and walk around on the playground and the road, without any sports achievements. If this continues, it will really fail the expectations of the female students. The school authorities, in view of this, opened up a corner in the northeast as a sports field for female students, and hired a certain female physical educator as a professor. Recently, a volleyball team was organized, and a certain teacher from a middle school was invited to be the instructor. Every morning, dozens of "red scarf team" heroes can be seen walking to and from the playground in a majestic manner. This may be the beginning of physical education for Guanghua female students.</p>
<p>However, there is one thing that most hinders their physical development, that is, whenever female students do gymnastics, male students, like a tide, surround them in several layers to watch from the sidelines. Saying "good" is not good. Shouting loudly, "Her hair is too loose," "She has pigeon toes," the criticism can be described as "meticulous." The female students are a little embarrassed and afraid of going to physical education, so many people do not attend class. Fortunately, the physical education department has enclosed the female students' playground with a fence, leaving only one small entrance and exit. It is said that there are two purposes for this: one is to prevent male students from watching, and the other is to work hard to practice physical education. (Four)</p>

<p>Mongolian and Tibetan Issues</p>
<p>Most of the Tibetan Mipu foreign goods market is in the hands of Nepalese merchants. The Dalai Lama ordered the cancellation of their tax-free privileges and arrested and executed a troublemaker. In February, the government dispatched 9,000 troops to the border, where they are still in a stalemate. This is a picture of troops stationed in Lhasa preparing to set off in front of a large temple.</p>
<p>The new Prime Minister of Nepal, Bhim Shumshere Jung, is a well-known pro-British leader. In his inaugural speech, he said, "The friendly relations between Nepal and my strong ally, the British government, should continue as before, and I will make even greater efforts to protect this most precious country for our survival."</p>

<p>Yinxu... summer news about the water... it is delightful that the shores of the river are either the same or submerged and shallow.</p>
<p>New Discoveries in the Excavation of Anyang Yinxu</p>
<p>Newly unearthed divination bone, the belly of the tortoise shell has been shaved and the carving is very meticulous. The clay has not been completely removed. There is a small hole near the top, possibly for installation purposes.</p>
<p>The ceramic pattern on the bronze ritual vessel is derived from the Shang Dynasty Yi vessels. The patterns are all small pieces, and there is Guan Xun Yi Fan along the edge, which can be used several times. When casting the vessel, if several molds can form one vessel, some will be wrapped in copper rust.</p>
<p>A picture of the excavation scene. The workers either dig the soil with small shovels or crawl with their five fingers. Even small objects are completely taken out without damaging them with water. Mr. Li Xu is the supervisor.</p>
<p>Rope-patterned rice</p>
<p>Animal-eared white pottery. These types of pottery are all fragments in the soil, without sound or shape, but the carved patterns are extremely rich, or they are also types of Yi vessels.</p>
<p>There are round feet under the earthenware pot. They came out at seven o'clock, already late.</p>
<p>Newly unearthed bone treasure engraved with characters. It is a live shoulder blade that has been shaved. There are words (Liao Shi Ju Shui) in the engraved words, which is today's water. There are extremely many place names in the bone inscriptions, and only this water can be accurately written down now.</p>
<p>The purpose of the carved bone chips is unknown. Some are inlaid with turquoise, and some seem to be decorations.</p>
<p>Bronze spear unearthed. Looking at the image, ancient weapons unearthed are mostly halberds, and spears are very rare. The bottom of this spear is empty to receive the secret. It is undoubtedly a stabbing weapon, and the state of preservation is very good, and the edge is as new.</p>
<p>The Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica of the Republic of China is excavating the Yin Ruins in Anyang, Henan. It is still a major undertaking in the modern academic world in China. Recently, Mr. Zi Qingzhi, the director of the Ancient Group and Anyang Excavation, passed through Shanghai on official business and talked about the excavation and color photography, saying that since the oracle bone inscriptions were unearthed in Guangxu, they have been collected by Wang (Yi Rong), Liu (E), Luo (Zhenyu), and edited by Sun (Yirang) and Wang (Guowei), becoming an important issue in the Chinese academic world. However, the institute focused on this matter in the 30 years of the Republic of China, only seeking to replicate this matter from the perspective of the box-stone school. It devoted itself to this and achieved nothing other than textual research. Important materials are therefore grouped by year. This cannot be compared to Mr. Dong Zuobin. China has always regarded archaeology as inferior work and disdains to do it. But the importance of ancient objects only lies in their characters. When the institute organized archaeological affairs, it immediately corrected this point of view and took excavation as the basic work of archaeology. The first time it was implemented in Yinxu, Anyang, was in the autumn of the 17th year, and the spring and autumn of the 18th year continued for two times. Each time, there were important discoveries. The research station then published a special issue by the Institute of History and Philology. In total, the three excavations achieved the most important things regarding the following common points: (1) The scope of the Yin Ruins; (2) The situation of the accumulation of each layer in the ground; (3) The changes in the map after the formation of the region; (4) The discovery of new oracle bone inscriptions and their accumulating conditions; (5) Simultaneous evidence of oracle bone inscriptions. The most important of these is the Tao, stone, carved jade, bone, and bronze vessels of various kinds. Regarding the above questions and discoveries, there are specialized texts and discussions that will be published in the Anyang excavation report one after another. The excavation work is not yet fully completed, so the institute has four more excavation plans. When the time is right, the team will set off immediately. Mr. Zi also said that according to the experience gained from the discoveries, the oracle bone inscriptions currently stored in the market, various museums, and private collections have been published and engraved. Among them, the oracle bone inscriptions discovered by the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica, which were examined with a scientific eye, are the only species of genuine products. Although the current number is only more than 3,000 pieces, their value is higher than all the oracle bone inscriptions currently stored in various places.</p>
