<p>時評</p>
<h3>美國之新稅則案</h3>
<p>美國之新稅則案。爲美國目前最重要之問題。一部分人。以爲此案巳非胡佛救濟農民之初旨。即使通過農民非特不能得分毫救濟之益。且將大受其殃。一部分人。以爲此案偏重某種製造品。結果將增加全國勞工之痛苦。爲害國外貿易及國内商貨流通甚巨。大都皆露失望之意。然自美國之歷史觀之。欲使稅則之平衡。則甚非易事。蓋美國之自耕農。素占重要地位。自與工業大資産家。爲爭土地的經濟政策而奮鬭爲反對高率的關稅而奮鬭旣遭失敗。而大戰以後。農民益陷於困境。一九二一年。两院曾通過所謂緊急關稅法。以資救濟。但威薾遜總統。以爲農民所必需者。不在保護關稅。而在得較好的國外市場。故即加以否認。然亦未有實在辦法。以救農民。至一九二六年自耕農與大銀行又起衝突。於是議會又通過所謂剩餘統制法案。意在調和而柯立芝總統。則聲明否認自耕農法。一方確認有利於大銀行方面之法律。至是而農民與工業資本家鬭爭。勝利遂全歸資本家方面。農民因不堪壓迫之苦况欲力趨於提高農業生産物價格之一人管而不可得。乃退而要求廢止工業保護關稅與减低工業生産物價格。以冀確立農工生産物價格間之均衡。農民方面所盼望者在是。而他方面則又以爲與其利益有衝突。糾紛至今未巳。此新稅則之所以久延而不决歟。今之參議院。雖云障礙巳消大半。然欲滿足各方之願望。則殊不易。歷任美總統對此問題。皆感棘手。今之胡佛。當亦不能避此一例也。</p>

<h3>觸目驚心的一瞥·吳·墨·西</h3>
<p>十八日應友人之約。參觀三十周紀念會於東亞同文書院。抵院巳下午二時。來賓被邀者。均贈精良之紀念册一本。余等先入音樂室聽音樂。除西方名曲外。有口琴合奏。頗佳妙。末爲「都之春琴友會」三絃合奏。男子二人吹「尺八」。形如簫而粗。聲殊嘹亮。女子五人奏弦器。形如中國古琴。聞每具價須三百元。且彈且唱音聲和婉。半似梵音佛號。悽愴動人。歷久始巳。旣出、參觀「寮祭」。寮祭者。各敎室之自由佈置也。隨處都有深意。而大都係批評中日時事。如彼邦之緊縮政策。我國之蔣閻政爭等。其中最爲我所欣賞者。一爲四馬路之表裏。表面如各書店之出版物。似使文化向上者。而其裏則性史春册及野雞。悉係引人堕落者。觀之殊不能不首肯也。一爲日本文學家有島武郎之戀愛自殺事件。室中佈置墓門宿草。一片慘綠。悲風悽其。蕭瑟作響。两骷髏接吻於蘆葦中。題曰「靈之接吻」。洵富有藝術意味之作也。其他如一室僅留一穴、内望則一片黑暗。室外大書「支那之一切現狀」。意義昭然。發人深省。觀畢。再遊圖書館。入其研究室。中外各種雜誌無不備。而尤注意於中國之研究。有一書架。上列精裝巨帙之書數十册。而專研江浙戰爭之内容者。巳達五六本。觀之令人咋舌。另一室陳列考察中國内地狀况之寫眞備僻如貴州及浙江之甌江上游風景。詳盡如西安附近之古蹟。均爲我人所不易見者、且多有美術價值。而最令人觸目驚心者。厥爲五月事件之印刷品。如五一五七五九之文告。五卅之傅單標語。無不搜羅詳盡。彚訂成册。至於國民政府各種宣言。悉裝裱如册頁。各種反共反蔣之宣傅品。則分類編存。於上可見東人之處心積慮。不尙口頭而重研究者。遠非老大國國民。所能望其項背也。聞友人言。是校經常費。年達三百萬。悉由日政府支撥。中國如中大交大、亦年不過二百萬也。月派學生赴中國内地考察。中國學生則派赴彼國、其往也。所至有日人招待。酬酢無虚日。故所得僅皮毛。毛徒然亨一回物質之樂而巳。校門内草地上。新立前校長根津之銅像。是人係主張設立同文書院之最力者。亦即主張侵略中國之陰謀家也。此次開會。日本内閣諸大臣專誠派人來華訓話者三。其中一人。且係年老之公爵。一區區學校也。而重視若。其故可深長思矣。歸後感不自己。因拉雜書此。告我國人。</p>
<h3>誌金山諸葛銅鼓·弢·安</h3>
<p>鎭江江天禪寺某梵舍。中有諸葛亮輔蜀漢時。鳴之以壯土威者。大小與普通相彷彿。質堅重而色深黝。叩之鑑然。如擊清磬。鑄工繪事。備極精緻。面刻圖案。狀行星繞日之形。角端十二。恰類黨徽此原偶合。毫無足異。迨革命軍底定京江後。青天白日之幟。遍揚大江南北。寺僧以與鼓面繪圖相像。因而視同神秘。逢人說項用作歛錢工具。自茲以往。四方檀越之來游者。莫不爭相瞻仰佈施而去。此千數百年沒世無聞之諸葛銅鼓。經斯宣傅。名果大彰。今後迨將永與靈山浮圖。共垂不朽矣。</p>
<h3>記浦東一實業家覺迷</h3>
<p>南匯七團凌秀峯者。錦綸毛巾廠主人也。今日國貨毛巾之中。實推三友實業社與錦綸毛巾廠出品爲冠。而錦綸毛巾廠即創於民國四年五月九日之後。蓋當時凌君旣受日本剌戟。以爲惟振興實業。可以雪國恥惟推廣國貨。可以救祖國。顧凌君雖有此心。而無多大之資本。則於其本鄉設一毛巾廠。名之曰錦綸。置機二十乘。一方雇鄉間女工織巾。一方率妻子漂白。曝乾。裝潢。故雖一廠主。而終日蓬頭跣足。親爲賤役。見者但以爲廠中工人。不知爲廠之主人也。及至成貨之後。則又携至滬上。親向商家兜銷。兜銷時則又布衣一襲。僕僕市廛。見者又以爲兜銷員不知爲廠主人也。其時滬上商家。旣以其牌子未著。行銷未廣。故事吹求。故意抑勒。凌君低首下心。於貨物之應攺良者。悉心攺良。於價格能低抑者。加意低抑。務使商家無所藉口。故其成本。旣較他爲重。而其獲利則較他家爲薄。因之不數年間。錦綸廠之出品。得人信用。銷路大暢故設廠迄今。十有五年。而其機數與年俱增。今其廠中。置機至有八百乘。雇工至千數百人。與其初創之時。實不可同日而語矣。今其毛巾之行銷。除各省外。達於外洋各地。今吾國人於毛巾盡用國貨。使舶來之品絶跡者。凌君蓋與有力焉。故如凌君者。可謂創辦實業之一成功者。然其初創之時。其於出貨甘充賤役。其於行銷甘受人氣。惟其堅忍不拔。遂有今日之成功。記之以告當世之振興實業者。</p>

<h3>紅氍毹</h3>
<p>七星燈徐筱汀</p>
<p>前晚觀九十老人孫菊仙之七星燈於上海舞臺。此劇係自火燒葫蘆峪演起。菊老之孔明。坐帳時扶二琴童上場。步伐頗穩。曾不因帶網巾穿厚底靴而少滯。眞人瑞也。遣將之次序。井井有條。唱工亦貼絃。足證其記憶力與耳聰力尙强也。二次上塲。聞馬岱報葫蘆略所埋伏之地雷爲暴雨所毁。司馬懿父子與魏延皆被走。脫諸語。　然自座驚起。面上同時現出急愕神色。旋又歸坐。此處表情。最適合於文靜之孔明。較之通常疾呼「嗷」字者。得體多矣。落坐後。且不作無濟於事之怨恨語。亟接白「那魏延回來必有一番吵閙。」此點係孔明知務所急之勝人處。於是僞罪馬岱以平魏延之怒。菊老表做孔明佯怒僞笑之機警。臺下莫不頷首而笑。旗牌交令時。孔明詢明其因貪司馬懿酒宴而誤洩己之食少事煩實情。爲之一急。鬚抖頭顫。亟以羽扇怒指旗牌。旗牌懼而自座左退至座右。步法成一弧形。羽扇亦隨之由左而右。此處極爲傅神。此老誠不老矣。「仰面朝天」一段二簧原板。醇然有厚味存焉。拜燈一塲。先由該臺經理常雲恒及名票陳剛叔先生左右扶衛而上。菊老忽撇開二人。獨步至九龍口。唱「嘆高皇」一段慢二簧。健矣哉。此段並未减詞。「光武興」之「興」字。及「把主欺壓」之「壓」字。均以長腔將胡琴過門拖足。神韻一如往昔之旁薄。禳星之念詞。典雅誠懇。譚鑫培决無此文才也。「皇天后土曷其斯極」之「極」字。用音三震以作結。聲音異常洪亮。而富感情。菊老之絶技也。「諸葛亮也非是」一段原板。噴放茹蓄之妙。衣稀可以神會。垂危之二簧搖板。有二處用力翻高。擒縱得宜。聆之如服一劑清心散。「無常到萬事休」之「事」字。唱時。連連顫頭作吐血狀。餘音即隨之而抖搖。眞十分悽慘也。只此數句唱。幾處表做。巳足抵時下瘟生（癆瘟之鬚生）一大齣戲而有餘。菊老之得意弟子陳剛叔先生。前歲曾將此劇上述之三大段二簧灌音於大中華唱片公司。悠然有菊老神韻。老旣未留眞正唱片。則剛叔此片。尤足珍貴。蓋傅孫派絶唱。舍彼莫屬故也。（却酬）</p>

<h3>日匯有行無市</h3>
<p>英美略長···掛牌不動</p>
<p>昨日黄銀略轉長勢美銀仍低、市况極靜横濱·神户蟄處寂境矣匯豐掛牌外匯除香港加七五、計八十两○七五外其餘悉無變化、惟英美内盤晨鬆即堅復趨萎勢、日金則無相當之交易、故價尙屬緊利然進出價離開甚遠、乃華商咸存觀望、迨午刻收市比諸上日計先令略長○六二五、美金長一二五、日金反加半分、不啻有行無市之景况也、至於金市風波仍然險惡倐忽千變、無從捉摸耳實受銀稅問題之紛擾耳結果濳伏低落也計英金成交十餘萬鎊華商約有售出十分之六、銀行如麥行。三井·工商納進、又中日等行對做數萬鎊、惟三井略有賣出、而美金鮮有買賣、至日金僅由大連帮售與三井現大連幾十萬元午後因逢週三無市、</p>

<h3>銀價英長美縮</h3>
<p>昨據倫敦電訊大條銀略見回長、如近期加長零六二五爲十八便士八一二五、（合英金爲一先令十便士二五）、遠期亦長零六二五、計十八便士七五、脚地無大變化、極形呆寂、又接紐約電訊、而美銀價仍在跌風中、計現貨縮去三七五、爲四角○二五之新紀錄、美對英勿更、仍爲四元八角六分、英對美升上零六二五、計四元八角六分零三一二五、日美仍爲四十九元四三七五、日英仍計二先令○四○六二五、英滬先令回長零六二五、爲一先令十便士一八七五、孟買無市、又路透電及電通社到概無升降、</p>

<h3>編遣驟漲二元餘</h3>
<p>昨日本埠證劵市場各債成交情形、期市暢旺、賣買飛常活潑、但現貨除編遣進出較多外、其他極清、時局形勢稍佳、市場人心良好、投資買進者激增、價乃一致返漲、編遣各方購胃尤濃、期貨飛漲達二元三四角關稅亦漲高一元三角、整六裁兵各漲七八角、其他以求供甚平、非常呆定、前後市祇數角盤旋、全日現貨成交二萬五千二百元、其貨上下午開出一千一百餘萬、</p>

<p>紗花標紗略挺實銷又靜</p>
<p>紗市趨勢毠挺、增加出廠稅之說、甚囂塵上、致人心堅硬、市氣較佳、散户扒空、多頭依然不動、故形勢轉緊、而海外情形仍疲、現紗銷路、各帮均無久長之力、前日交易頗現活動之狀昨則又告岑寂、紗市照根本上測之、仍無大漲面也、因倉庫中二十支五福、牧羊銷塲缺乏、暫以空氣良好、或有小小回風、亦未可知也、</p>

<h3>華北棉紗輸出激增</h3>
<p>上海棉紗四月份輸出計八萬零四百八十三包比二月份較增加三萬六千零六十一包爲今年最高之數字、此因需要時期關係、故有此增加、其中以華北輸出爲最多、茲列表如下（單位包）</p>

<h3>棉市迄難振作</h3>
<p>棉市大勢平靜、目前恐無大變化、美棉亦在盤旋之中、測其情形、暫時亦無大伸縮發現、不過銷費、巳較去年爲减、一般執貨者對於本埠底貨薄弱、漢市高昂、來源缺乏、買進之意較濃拉緊不放、各廠多數印棉吸飽亦無恐慌之虞、故現棉銷路全絶、且有一批火機花、花用愈缺、棉市前途、仍無大發展耳、</p>
<p>恒大多頭轉賣二千包漢標前市開盤、形勢平澹、美棉微漲、塲面較鬆、各月跌五分、午後散户扒空漲五分至一錢、惟本月份恒大仍出二千担、市勢較疲、全日成交統計二萬三千八百担、茲將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>宜溧新繭歉收</h3>
<p>統扯四分年歲···繭行開秤寥寥</p>
<p>宜興·溧陽均爲産繭之區、近來受匪禍影響、蠶事减色、今歲匪氛仍熾農民不敢多育蠶種、更兼氣候失調、天寒雨多、蠶蟻大受損害、現下宜溧两邑、早蠶己落繭、晚蠶甫行出人、問有上簇者、前日雷雨終日、始熱終寒蠶蛾又起變化、眠頭不起、今歲四鄉繭産、勢必歉折、統址至多不過四分年歲各鄉繭行因畏懼匪禍、開秤者寥若農星、惟城區及近城各市鎭、仍有換帖開秤者、統計不及往歲十之二三云、</p>
<h3>杭屬繭價飛漲</h3>
<p>攺良種優繭價巳開八十元以上</p>
<p>杭屬臨平、塘栖瓶窰、拱宸橋艮山門等處繭行、開秤巳屆旬餘、市上到貨頗旺各行積極競收繭價由五十五六元漲至六十七八元、前日陰雨終日、到貨稀少、各繭行因今歲浙屬繭産較去歲須打八折深恐日後原料恐慌、咸抱多收主義、放價爭收昨市天雨稍止、到貨仍不見擁、繭價飛漲攺良種高貨價巳漲至八十元以上云</p>
<h3>祁茶開至二百二十两</h3>
<p>祁門紅茶、自星期一日上市以來、英莊行家對於葉底製法優良之貨、搜買不遺餘力、但此項高莊貨、供不敷求、市價業巳拾至二百二十两、開空前未有之新紀錄、惟是中低莊之祁寗各路紅茶、英莊進意依然清淡、良以英倫市場、印度茶存底甚豐、難與頡　、至綠茶市面、土莊珍眉銷路完全停頓、遂安來路莊貨亦未能認爲佳象云、</p>
<h3>婺源西南茶紛紛開秤</h3>
<p>婺邑新茶、連日各號議盤、北鄉户園茶、因格於號價撳低、不願脫沽、昨日僅前坦開秤、售價六十六元、洪村售價六十八元、高梘段出價六十四元、其餘殊鮮定盤、故日來北鄉茶號、羣趨西南採辦、因西南鄉今歲茶産、較東北見早、又先開園、出貨細嫩、茶號需要甚殷、昨日西鄉甲道開秤、售價五十八元、北坑頭·麻榨汎·售價六十元、湖山六十二元、下嚴田五十六元、上言田六十元、長林五十八元、南鄉中雲、樟睦一帶、亦齊帮開秤、售價六十元、西南山户存茶、經各號搜買、巳沽出十分之六、北鄉户園茶、近日反無人問津、市面奇冷、中雲豸峯南路茶號、現均進茶一二百担、前日起俱紛紛開揀趕製、今日（十四）城·思婺口票價、因各號需要孔亟、來源不充、巳激漲至一千三百二十八元、未備現洋之號、均受票價之虧折云、（十四日）</p>
<h3>糧食陰雨中米市堅靜</h3>
<p>閘北昨日各檔到源微有見抵、但河斛因天雨不息、仍難開動、故市交沉靜、惟北粳曾稍做開緣廠棧貨尙可打樣評價、情勢略覺堅穩錫帮中關粳大盤十九元半至二十元不等、殊與前两市相彷薄稻羊尖停頓、賣買雖略見微交然因不易動斛、故續觀望、全日各貨盤面統無上落、晨問稍有成交、卒因雨絲連綿、仍趨沉悶、婉然停頓也、</p>
<p>滬南到船寥寥、市銷微動、北粳因天雨關係、賣方略行喊高、但浦中天雨、殊難過斛、故買方胃淡觀望、上高貨帶緊數分、中次各貨、仍無轉榮之可能倘天宮續雨不止、則來源勢必影響價格不免轉上、而南路薄早稻及羊杜尖均因雨奇靜、故之乏準的、但平米即將發售、洋米又續軟弱、是以粳秈市况、恐益沉靜、白元積貨較有去路不佳價格因仍下游、全日各檔成交極少、因天雨難斛之故也、</p>
<h3>麫粉多頭出檔午後回疲</h3>
<p>昨日粉市呈初堅繼疲之象、上午初盤時以天雨不息、人心轉昻、惟以後各盤、因外行多頭、近遠期均紛紛出檔、蓋節上漲之後、一般内地帮欣欣之色、彷彿有夢想不到之感想、故趨此機會、巳不願再扳、隨時脫手、本來此種局面之造成、固爲軋空所帶起、而内地帮之趁火打刧、亦得不少之助力也、觀察後步、以廠家仍無放鬆之態、過分之鬆動、終須待諸新麥時期也、結果本月份較前日小五厘、六月份小二厘半、七八月份不動、九月份小五厘、十月份不動云、</p>
<h3>麥市期現均無上落</h3>
<p>昨日期麥大致呈盤旋之象以洋麥報小四五七角不等、惟天陰復雨投機者不免有所顧慮、但新麥收獲時期、尙有半月至两旬左右、尙無緊要、因距收汎一近、則未免稍受影響也、結果六七八月份不動九十月份較小一分、現麥做開仍稀、各檔開價、亦鮮上落、此後陳麥將達落令、新貨即可接替、此種行情、當難再高矣、開徐州麥蚌埠麥山東麥五两一錢七分漢口麥四两五錢半、四两四錢三分、共開一千五百包云、</p>
<h3>洋米因贛辦復漲</h3>
<p>昨日洋米因到存两充、上午開市後、市價依然平疲、午後怱有江西帮及浙路與本街等之搜辦、形勢立見轉機、各米均上漲五六分、大小絞更見挺俏、統市成交小絞六千包、價十四元三角半、又糙米二千包、價十三元一角三分、大絞三千包、價十四元一角、一號西貢五百包、價十五元一角、又二號三百包、價十四元四角云、</p>
<p>海味江北頭汛蝦子昨到三擔</p>
<p>售價一百八十至一百九十五两</p>
<p>蝦十蟹十、陳貨早巳斷檔新貨爲天時不正收獲欠旺昨到江北頭汎蝦子、三百數十斤、售價一百八十两、至一百九十五两、貨身潮濕、色光萎黑、以屬首批、要手尙俏、即由本街及漢帮、分拆售通、聞二汎貨不日亦可運到、後盤市價、勢防轉跌、新蟹子近日天津寗波江北三處、均有裝來市售原乾好貨七十五两、做色貨六十两至六十八两、</p>
<p>五金白鐵白鐵瓦欣欣向榮</p>
<p>白鐵無論英美諸貨、新近均有欣欣向榮之勢、蓋連日外匯暴縮、各貨成本激增、而尤以日貨爲最、查日貨定價、較申市高起一成之多、所以同業無訂購者、刻市如英貨二十四號每担估十一两二錢半二十六號十二两、二十八號十二两七錢半、三十一號十三两八錢半、美貨則二十四號估十二两二錢半、二十六號十三两七錢半、二十八號十四两七錢半、四十八號十四两交易長江閩浙諸帮較爲暢快而北路生意似覺冷落云</p>
<p>白鐵瓦黄霉時節將屆、北路添辦較廣、因之市貨遂有被購殆盡之勢、標準因流動貨十分寥落、以致供不敷求、市價奇挺如二十四號估十两零五錢二十六號十一两五錢、二十八號十二两二錢半雖昨逢天雨然成交依然可觀也、</p>

<h3>依力克申電話公司意見書</h3>
<p>對於華洋電話公司出售案顧問會報告書</p>
<p>華洋電話公司出售案、巳由顧問委員會將承售各家之投標審查完畢、並將其報告呈獻於公衆、此事於電話用户及華洋公司股東之利益均有關係故敢直陳意見如下、</p>
<p>顧問會報告中曾言其决定之標準、（一）須顧全股東之益利、（二）須顧全用户之利益、故必先知何家之投標能攺良服務並於最短時間内完全攺裝自動電話而確保其滿意、是則顧問會决定之標準、固以股東之利益居前、伊力克申公司允付股東每股銀一百两、國際電話電報公司祗允付每股銀七十五两、顧問會乃以國際公司之價格爲公平、此公平之價格、固用何法估計乎、照依力克申公司之估計、則華洋公司股票之實價爲每股銀八十两此外公司之牌號與顧主之所值爲每股銀二十两殊非公平之價格乎、</p>
<p>顧問會旣以顧全股東利益居前、郤使股東不能多得每股二十五两之利益、其原因或爲顧全用户利益起見、但按之事實、適得其反、國際公司要求週息一分零五、伊力克申公司要求週息九厘、其差爲一厘半至民國二十一年、國際公司須付出之資本爲銀一千三百一十萬零二十两須息銀一百三十二萬五千五百一十两、伊力克申公司須付出之資本爲銀一各二百萬两、須息銀一百零八萬两、其差爲二十九萬五千五百一十两、此每年約三十萬两之息銀、將來皆須由用户擔負、如接受伊力克申公司之投標、此每年約三十萬两之息銀、即可省去、豈非用户之利益乎、</p>
<p>顧問會以國際公司之交貨迅速、爲其優點之一、然投標之三公司、固皆以文字擔保其定期交貨、豈吾人之允許均不足信任乎就事實而論、則所謂國際公司之交貨迅速者、在本埠中區電話接線處、固说民國十二年定貨、至民國十六年始裝置完竣、可以應用也</p>
<p>國際公司之又一優點、爲其職員巳熟諳廻旋式自動電話之運用方法、且向有訓練、然按之事實、則所謂職員、僅有七個外國人、五十九個中國人、曾受此項訓練、其餘大多數之職員則於使用此新裝置以前尙須加以訓練也</p>
<p>顧問會謂國際公司所呈獻之利益、爲電話之迅速攺良、而對於伊力克申自動電話之裝置與運用、其需費可以較省且於两年内可以裝竣一節、則以謂未能滿意、其不信任依力克申公司之能履行投標條件、實爲余等所最反對者、伊力克申爲世界著名之公司、其所應允之條件、當然爲世人所信任、在顧問會訊問時、予曾告以建設上價值之估計、並證明伊力克申式（即進步式）自動電話與廻旋式自動電話相較、一切費用皆便宜節省、即建築工廠伊力克申式的建築費、不及國際公司之半、吾人可以現在上海之二種電話接線處相較、東區電話接線處、係伊力克申式、於民國十三年裝置、中區電話接線處、係廻旋式、於民國十六年裝置、據安森氏之意見、東區接線處、其狀况仍然完好、運用亦　順利、中區接線處、經三年工作後、巳需極費之修理、方能運用順利、故經長時間之試騐、二接線處之熟優熟劣巳極明嘹矣、</p>
<p>伊力克申公司之投標内、亦曾擬及攺用史特郎式自動電話、而顧問會則以謂如用史特郎式、須由電報電話信託公司承辦、然伊力克申公司、固有一大工廠在英國之俾斯頓、事爲英國郵務局製造史特郎式設備、且可與英國利物、浦之自動電話製造公司合作由其工廠送史特郎式設備於中國、一切材料、皆爲英貨且可派有訓練之職員前來管理顧問會對於伊力克申公司之提議、似未給以相當之注意其所注意者、爲國際公司及信託公司之提議、而選擇於廻旋式與史特郎式二者之間、故顧問會之所决定、殊令人難於索解也、</p>
<p>伊力克申公司在世界中建設電話事業、巳有五十年之經騐、實足以造福於上海之民衆、余敢信諸君必與以相當的注意、决不於未經考慮以前、對於顧問會之報告、即加以贊成也、</p>

<h3>埃及古墓内之珍寳</h3>
<p>偶然發現於埃及的古墓、也曾宣傅過世界了、獲得的珍寳、自是古色古香、尤其是幾件稀世之珍「最稱名貴、不佞得着這種珍訊、也來給閱者們介紹一下、</p>
<p>古墓所在地</p>
<p>古墓發現於埃及的「獅身人面像」不遠、獅身人面像是埃及古蹟之一、說起來却有一段故事、現在也談上一談吧、</p>
<p>希臘神話上說、『從前有一女怪、生</p>
<p>雙翅、人面獅身、曾在路旁石巖上坐着、見到行過的人、便用謎語問他道、「今有一物、初則四足、繼則二足、</p>
<p>後則三足、足最多時而年齡最幼、是什麽、」如果答不出的、便將他殺了、後來有一人、名曰愛地普司、他說「就是人了、因爲人之初生、學習行走時、總以手足據地練習、這是四足、長大了、才用两足自行、老了、却扶杖而躑躅、這時便宛如三足呢、」女怪聽罷、就投海以終云、』</p>
<p>古墓的内容</p>
<p>古墓裏面、築着十九間狹小的石室、這些石室之内、藏着美女屍身數十具、中間用很厚的石膏板隔着、行列整齊、並不紊亂、如許的石刻、以拉皇的石像最偉大了、拉皇生前是埃及最出色的高僧、其他奇形怪狀的神像、令人見而發噓、博得觀衆讚賞而注意的、便算石刻的豹頭了、两目圓睜、虎虎有生氣、石室之外闢有一深長之甬道、倒置一極大石膏所製成的圓柱、塑着各上級僧侶家族的遺容、拉皇的像、也嵌在當中、另有一室、周圍約十五碼、中有石柱、刻着拉皇生平的事蹟、喪儀的狀况、繪事逼眞、雕工巧緻、柱角鐫有祭文一篇、字跡還未蝕滅、大約是拉皇家族所撰的、尙有許多祭品和雜物、隨地狼藉、就祭品的類别而審度、可以想及拉皇生前時的嗜好和生活槪况了、</p>
<p>古墓的珍實</p>
<p>在拉皇雕像的四周、陳列着許多石膏製成的長頸瓶、掘墓的人、始初還不大明瞭它的用處、可是當入石室時、便有異香撲鼻、心脾頓覺舒暢、彷彿有鮮花植於瓶中、這時才知瓶裏曾經栽過花的、然而數千年來、香氣依然留着、許多人便欵是瓶内有藥遺留、這大槪因奇異而産生的疑案罷了、這些古物之中、最美麗動人的、要推一隻極大的金製花瓶了、金色耀煌、爘爛奪目、瓶内滿插金製花枝、更覺富麗堂皇了、據玩古家說、埃及古物現世以來、從未有過這般名貴的、許多頸飾之中、有一串是用四千粒紅寳石貫在一條金練上製成的、頸飾之旁、有一張水草紙、詳紀頸飾製成的經過、聽說這串頸飾、是拉皇生前最珍愛的寳物、後來拉皇結婚、便將這件珍寳、賜給她的媳婦作拜見禮品云、（對）</p>
<h3>世界文學的故事（一）（五）（八）美國約翰瑪西警胡仲持譯</h3>
<p>第四十章德意志文學的古典時代</p>
<p>哥忒霍爾特·以法蓮·勒新是戲曲作家·學者·思想家·批評家、首先是、他寫過優美的散文、他以爲自己缺乏創造的力、而如往往被忘似的、忘却了偉大的文體本身就是在最高程度的創造、他的批評論文和神學底小册子、有些在今日缺着内容的現實性了、這事是琉細安及斯尉夫特同樣地有着的運命、然而繪畫或詩的批評家誰也不敢說不知『雷奥科温』、劇的批評家或歷史家、誰也不敢說不知『漢堡劇作法』、又思想兄的研究者誰也不敢說不知『人類的敎育』或『服爾分步忒斷片』罷、以上的諸作和别的全然缺乏價值的作品、憑了那澄明和輝煌的機才·和雄辯·和構造的完成、對於愛文學的人們都是貴重的、和勒新的精神相接觸的事、無論他處理着的生材怎樣、總之是自由的敎育之謂、爲什麽呢、因爲約翰生寫於哥德斯密的墓石的話可以人一然適當地用於他的、『沒有他未嘗試寫的什麽種類的文章、又沒有他觸了而未加修飾的文章』、對於劇作家勒新、人非以同樣的尊敬、但較冷靜地來述說不可、他在『班海爾謨的明那』、將最初的古典底喜劇、又在『賢者拿單』將在高位的最初的詩劇給與德意志國民、這两種作品都還流行於舞台、然而『班海爾謨的明那』並沒有略略褪色、即就『賢者明那』、也可以說、那最高的價值是在這再度說明了那作者的高貴、寛容和澄明的心性的、</p>
<p>要將這德意志作家的最大者、又一切文學中的最上的人物之一哥德、簡單地寫個明白是困難的、他是最大的巨匠中最近代底的人物、因而在精神·氣質·活動也是最爲複雜的、但丁代表着中世紀底世界觀及宇宙觀、莎士比亞代表着學藝復興期的道德底秩序、哥德則並不代表着什麽、他是近代人、是探求努力而使生這東西結晶爲藝術的人、他是第一流的抒情詩人、在昨日·今日·及長期間的明日、對於近代人、帶着同神曲之於十四世紀的人們一樣的關係的「浮士德、」</p>
<p>他是那作者、「浮士德」表現着我們｜我們的時代、問題、道德底冒險、而且由書翰談話格言風詩韻文及散文的格言等、構成着有寛廣的範圍與恒久的意義的智慧的文學、在其中、近代底或科學底時代的一切困難問題和活動是以發見反響於凡受敎育的人們中的言語、創造底地被詳論的、</p>

<p>White Blade Combat Results in Total Enemy Rout</p>
<p>Liu Zhi Arrives at Xiao Ba and Advances to Liu He</p>
<p>Pursuit Towards Lanfeng and Chenliu Underway</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Liu Zhi telegraphed from Xiao Ba to Xuzhou on the 21st: Enemy Guan Fuan is entrenched north of Liu He along the old course of the Yellow River. Sun Chu's forces are deployed on the front of the railway, and Yang Xiaoou's forces are deployed northwest of Ningling, all constructing strong fortifications. Our army launched a general offensive at dawn on the 21st, engaging in white blade combat, resulting in a total enemy rout and countless prisoners captured. Our army has now occupied Li Ba Ji and is advancing in pursuit towards Lanfeng and Chenliu, with expectations to reach Kaifeng before the 24th. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) News from the Road: The left and right wings of the Central Army are advancing fiercely towards Li Ba Ji and Yejigang. On the 21st, Liu Zhi had already advanced and stationed at Xiao Ba, and is about to advance towards Liu He to command. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) At noon on the 21st, a telegram from Guide stated that our army had broken through the vanguard of the Jin army. The majority crossed the Liu River and advanced fiercely, joining forces with units on the flank reaching the territory of Minquan, pursuing the enemy forces towards Neihuang and Lanfeng. Liu Zhi will advance to Liu He to command that evening. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) News from the Road: After the vanguard of the Central Army launched a fierce attack from the Liu River area on the 18th, they have connected with the flank units at Li Ba Ji, forming an encirclement of the enemy's main force in the Yejigang, Neihuang, and Lanfeng area. Fierce fighting continued on the 19th. Chiang has arrived in Guide to oversee the battle. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Military sources say that the eastern Henan plain is vast and suitable for field battles, with rapid advances and retreats. It is predicted that once the enemy's main force is broken, they will completely collapse. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Qian Zongze took a transport vehicle to Guide on the 19th to supervise the road construction and handle military transport. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) After returning to Xuzhou from the front yesterday, Yu Feipeng escorted a large amount of supplies westward, going to Guide to establish a branch station. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Huang Bingheng flew from Guide to Xuzhou on the 20th to meet with Chiang and report on military affairs. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Second Army Corps' garrison office convened a local security meeting on the 20th. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Liu Zhi, seeing that the people of Guide are in dire straits after the battle, has presented a request to Chiang for generous relief and compensation. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The headquarters announced good news on the 21st: (1) The Jin army under Guan Fuan repeatedly launched fierce attacks on our Cao County positions, but were repelled by our army each time. The rebellious enemy suffered heavy losses. On the 16th, they were counterattacked by our army. After a fierce battle day and night, we captured one pseudo-division commander, Zong Fen, and over three thousand officers and soldiers, seizing a large amount of equipment and ammunition. On the evening of the 16th, the rebellious enemy fled towards Kaocheng, and our pursuing troops have crossed the old Kaocheng, vigorously pursuing and suppressing the remaining enemy. (2) According to captured officers, after the Jin army arrived in Henan, the Shanxi banknotes they issued were not accepted in the market. They were starving and fighting desperately, which was not what they wanted. They spoke with tears in their eyes, all willing to surrender to the Central Government. (3) On the Longhai front, the rebellious army of Wan is collapsing steadily. Our pursuing troops are advancing rapidly and have reached Li Ba Ji, advancing shoulder to shoulder with our army near Kaocheng on the right wing, and can directly attack Lanfeng. (4) On the 16th, during a fierce battle with the enemy at Xiao Pa Ji, our army used a portion of its forces to attack the enemy's rear, intercepting seventy-two large carts of supplies and ammunition. (5) Near Xiezhai, when a regiment of the rebellious enemy retreated to a western village, they were too rushed to escape due to our army's pursuit and were all captured. (6) When our army captured Guide, approximately 13,000 officers and soldiers of Wan's rebel army were all captured, including over 10,000 rifles, 68 machine guns, and over 20 field guns and mortars each, as well as countless supplies and ammunition. (7) On the 16th, the rebel army in the Heze area launched several fierce attacks on our defense line but were repelled by our army. At night, the enemy attacked again under the cover of rain, but were surprised by a cavalry unit ambushing on the left flank of the enemy. The rebel enemy, about a brigade strong, charged left and right and fell into an encirclement. Unable to discern directions in the darkness, they were attacked by our infantry and subjected to a strong assault. Apart from a portion that fled back, over 1,800 surrendered, including five battalion commanders and dozens of company and platoon leaders, all from Sun Guangqian's unit. (8) At Liuhe Station, our army engaged in several fierce battles with the rebel army. The enemy relied on strong fortifications and resisted stubbornly, but our army bravely broke through their positions. The enemy's morale faltered, and our entire line took the opportunity to pounce on them. The enemy collapsed and retreated in disarray, abandoning their weapons and begging for surrender. We captured one pseudo-regiment commander, five battalion and company commanders, and over 1,000 soldiers. (9) According to reports, the total number of rebel enemy captured in recent days has reached over 30,000. Our army is advancing steadily, and management is difficult. Please send them to the rear for disposal as soon as possible. The Prisoner Management Office of the headquarters has dispatched personnel to receive them. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to reports from military agencies: (1) The Jin army under Fu Zuoyi is currently retreating towards Tianjin. (2) The Northwest Army under Lu Zhonglin stationed in the Kaifeng area has completely retreated westward. (3) One regiment of Sun's rebel army remained stationed in Taikang. When Yan's cavalry arrived in Taikang, Sun's troops refused to cede the defense, causing a major conflict. (4) Feng Yuxiang came from Luoyang to Zhengzhou on the 19th night to organize a finance committee, and ordered all counties within the defense area not to accept official documents from elsewhere. As a result, the miscellaneous troops of Wan Xuancai and others are very resentful towards the Northwest. (5) The rebel army on the Longhai front has retreated to Lanfeng. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A telegram from Xuzhou on the 21st stated that Chen Cheng's 11th Division had crossed Ningling and reached Zhao Zhuang. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The New American Tariff Act</h3>
<p>The new American tariff act is the most important issue facing the United States today. Some believe that this bill has deviated from Hoover's original intention to aid farmers. Even if passed, farmers will not only fail to receive any relief but will suffer greatly. Some believe that this bill favors certain manufactured goods, which will increase the suffering of workers nationwide, and greatly harm foreign trade and domestic commodity circulation, mostly expressing disappointment. However, from the perspective of American history, achieving a balance in tariffs is not easy. The self-cultivating farmers of the United States have always occupied an important position. They struggled against the industrial capitalists for land and economic policies and fought against high tariffs, but failed. After the Great War, farmers were further plunged into difficulties. In 1921, both houses of Congress passed the so-called Emergency Tariff Act to provide relief. However, President Wilson believed that what farmers needed was not protective tariffs, but better foreign markets, so he vetoed it. However, there was no real way to save the farmers. In 1926, self-cultivating farmers and large banks clashed again. As a result, Congress passed the so-called Surplus Control Act, intending to reconcile. However, President Coolidge declared his denial of the self-cultivating farmers' law, confirming the laws that were favorable to large banks. At this point, the struggle between farmers and industrial capitalists was entirely won by the capitalists. Farmers could not bear the suffering of oppression and wanted to raise the price of agricultural products under unified management, but they could not achieve it. So they retreated and demanded the abolition of industrial protective tariffs and the reduction of industrial product prices, hoping to establish an equilibrium between the prices of agricultural and industrial products. This is what the farmers hoped for. However, others thought it conflicted with their interests. Disputes have not stopped until now. Is this why the new tariff has been delayed for so long without resolution? Although the Senate has removed most of the obstacles, it is not easy to satisfy the wishes of all parties. All past American presidents have found this problem difficult to handle. Today's Hoover will not be able to avoid this precedent either.</p>

<h3>External Announcements</h3>
<p>Letter to Mongol and Tibetan Compatriots</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a letter to Mongol and Tibetan compatriots on the occasion of the opening of the Mongolian Conference, the gist of which is that Mongol and Tibetan compatriots are all members of the Republic of China and must not be oppressed by other countries; the Mongol and Tibetan territories are an integral part of Chinese territory and must not be invaded by other countries; the local Mongol and Tibetan governments are all under Chinese sovereignty and must not be alienated or overthrown by other countries. As for the relations between China and Russia, although there are still various problems, the Ministry is continuing negotiations to seek a proper solution, and according to the Sino-Russian Agreement of 1924, China and Russia have reached complete equality in treaties, and it is clearly stipulated that the Soviet government recognizes Outer Mongolia as an integral part of China and respects Chinese sovereignty within that territory. Therefore, the Soviet Union has no special privileges in Outer Mongolia. Now the Central Government is gradually amending the remaining unequal treaties, striving to achieve the goal of complete abolition. As for the unequal treaties between China and Russia, they have long been abolished, and there is no reason to revert to inequality. Our Mongol and Tibetan compatriots, especially the Outer Mongolian compatriots, should be able to understand the intentions of the Central Government and be careful not to be bewitched by foreigners, and should urgently work together for the common interests of national survival, and unite to form a strong nation. Regarding Mongol and Tibetan diplomatic affairs, it should be unanimously recognized that the local Mongol and Tibetan governments only have the right to report to the Central Government and cannot directly engage in diplomatic negotiations, jointly protect the Central Government's unified diplomacy, and strive to concentrate national strength. Only when sovereignty is divided can we expect to win the international equality position in external struggles. I sincerely tell you, I hope you will pay attention to it. (21st Special Telegram)</p>

<p>All-India Congress Headquarters</p>
<p>Suddenly Searched by Military Police</p>
<p>Mrs. Naidu Also Detained</p>
<p>Police Use Force Everywhere</p>
<p>Many People Injured in Recent Days</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 21st: Three hundred and fifty policemen, including fifty armed ones, under the direction of senior police officers, surrounded the National Congress headquarters this morning and searched it thoroughly. Armed pickets were densely deployed around the area, with strict precautions. Those arrested included Ke Kese, the Vice President of the Bombay Provincial Congress, and his two secretaries, as well as the accountant of the Congress, a reporter for the Congress Bulletin, and two members of the military department. This was because the authorities had invoked Section 144 of the Criminal Law to prohibit the Congress from publishing bulletins, which the public had not complied with. Many documents were also confiscated. When the police transported the documents and other items away by car, a crowd followed them. The police wielded batons, injuring fourteen people, all of whom were sent to hospitals.</p>
<p>Reuters, Darasana, 21st: All the staff of the National Congress, including Chairman Naliman, have been arrested. Reuters, Bombay, 21st: Mrs. Naidu, a female poet and speaker, who succeeded Gandhi and Diya Baiji as the leader of non-violent resistance, has also been arrested. Gandhi's son, Lal Gandhi, and his secretary, as well as Elder Sahi Baib, who previously assisted Gandhi in the non-violent resistance movement in South Africa, have also been arrested. Prior to this, 2,000 volunteers attacked the salt depot, and the police beat them with batons, injuring a hundred people.</p>
<p>Reuters, Darasana, 21st: The former Speaker of the Legislative Council, Beitaier, has arrived here to command the volunteers who are attacking the prison depot, because Mrs. Naidu and others have been arrested. Reuters, Bombay, 21st: Ninety-five non-violent resistance volunteers arrived in Huadala today, intending to help attack the salt depot, but were arrested by the police as soon as they arrived.</p>
<p>Reuters, Be'ergan, Bombay Province, 20th: The leader of the non-violent resistance volunteers, who previously led the crowd to attack the Xiluoda Salt Depot, has now returned here. It is said that the government has stopped detaining people but is using batons. This move has created an atmosphere that can prompt the public to use force, which is very harmful to the doctrine of non-violent resistance. Therefore, the non-violent resistance volunteers have decided to suspend the offensive and resume it when the atmosphere is calm.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 21st: Hundreds of people gathered in front of the Indian Bank set up by Indians today to withdraw deposits, because it was heard that Chang Gela had used auxiliary forces to fight against the National Party, which aroused public anger. Gela has firmly denied this claim.</p>

<h3>British Unemployment Policy</h3>
<p>Differing Opinions Within the Government</p>
<p>May Lead to Cabinet Reshuffle</p>
<p>House of Commons Passes Second Reading of Financial Bill</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>May 22, 1930, Republic of China (Shen Bao</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th: Last night, the opposition party in the House of Commons moved to criticize the government for failing to adequately address the unemployment problem. This motion was put to a vote, and the government only had a majority of fifteen votes, because the left-wing Labor MPs and some Liberal MPs did not vote. Today, there is talk that Cabinet Minister Without Portfolio Mosley will resign. Mosley had joined with Minister of Works Lansbury and others to draft a memorandum, outlining unemployment relief measures. The scope of his plan was even greater than that proposed by Minister of Labor Thomas, who is in charge of unemployment affairs. The content of the memorandum has never been disclosed, but it is well known that there are differences of opinion between Mosley and Thomas. It is heard that Mosley wanted to resign within three days, but Lansbury dissuaded him. The Cabinet recently met and finally rejected Mo's memorandum. Mo is known for his eloquence in the House of Commons, but he did not participate in the debate yesterday. It is rumored that Mo believes that the government's majority has been reduced to five votes, which is equivalent to a vote of no confidence in the Minister of Labor. The Prime Minister is doing his best to persuade Mo to withdraw his resignation, and it is still difficult to predict. However, Mo can indeed get the support of powerful figures on the left wing of the Labor Party.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th: The House of Commons passed the second reading of the Financial Bill today. The motion to reject the bill proposed by former Chancellor of the Exchequer Horne was defeated by 282 votes to 206. The Liberal Party voted in favor of the government.</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting in Western Shandong Over the Past Five Days</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence, Today (19th) at the Provincial Government Memorial Week, Zhu Xi, Director of the Civil Affairs Department and acting Chairman of the Provincial Government, reported on the battle situation in western Shandong from the 14th to the recent five days, stating that Guan Fuan of the Jin faction led a division of troops to fiercely attack Cao County on the 14th. After being met head-on by the Central Army, Guan's troops were defeated and retreated into Henan Province. The Central Army is now pursuing them and has reached Kaocheng, about to go straight to Lanfeng. Sun Guangqian's division of Shi Yousan's troops also besieged Heze County (i.e., Caozhou) on the 16th, reaching only three li west of the city when they were fiercely attacked head-on by Fan Xiji and Ruan Zhaochang's two divisions and were also repelled, fleeing into Henan Province. Ruan's division is now pursuing southwestward, and Fan's division is pursuing northwestward. The left wing of our provincial army has established contact with the right wing of the Central Army. Only a remnant of the enemy remains on the south bank of the Yellow River, and they should be cleared soon. The main battlefield has shifted from Shandong Province to Henan Province, and western Shandong has indeed turned from danger to safety. Chairman Chen (Chen Tiaoyuan) supervised the troops at Longguji, 45 li west of Juye City, yesterday (18th), and Commander Fan (Fan Xiji) is on the front line, currently advancing forward. There has also been great progress on the Longhai Railway line, with the Central Army reaching Shuipuji. At the same time, on the Pinghan Railway line, the Central Army is also jointly attacking Zhengzhou, which can be recovered soon. In Changyi and Pingdu counties in eastern Shandong Province, local bandits have recently been discovered, and Commander-in-Chief Han (Han Fuqu) has dispatched troops to suppress them, which should be quelled. It is said that Han Fuqu and Ma Hongkui are currently commanding in Yuncheng, with most of Ma Hongkui's troops concentrated in Yuncheng, waiting to advance. Liu Zhennian has been in Jinan for several days, and because Han Fuqu's return to Jinan is uncertain, he took the Jiaoji train back to Yantai today to defend against further attacks (19th).</p>
<h3>Contents of the Sino-French Vietnam Trade Agreement</h3>

<h3>Foreigners' Enthusiasm for Xinjiang Archeology</h3>
<p>Stein Has Taken Away Chinese Antiquities Three Times and Wants to Go Again</p>
<p>Xinjiang is our country's northwestern border, located in the center of Asia. Before sea routes opened, it was a vital transportation hub between Europe and Asia. In ancient times, it was a prosperous region, leaving behind a large number of antiquities, which are treasures of Chinese cultural history. Moreover, due to the dry climate, the state of preservation is excellent. For the past forty years, Europeans who have gone to Xinjiang for archeological research have returned fully loaded. During the Qing Dynasty, the government was ignorant and did not cherish these extremely valuable historical materials, allowing people to take them away without any restrictions. As a result, modern domestic scholars who want to study this period of national history must seek them in foreign museums. In recent years, domestic academic institutions have gradually recognized the importance of collecting and preserving such historical materials. There was once an organization called the Northwest Scientific Expedition Team, and the results of its work were excellent. Although foreigners participated, all cultural and historical materials were kept in the country and were not allowed to be transported abroad. The conditions were very strict. Recently, it has been heard that the Hungarian Stein has once again been ordered by the British government to come to China to request a passport to go to Xinjiang for archeological research. Stein has been to Xinjiang, Gansu, and other places three times, taking away a large number of Dunhuang sutras, Western Region bamboo slips, and Buddhist statues, which are now all in the British Museum. The purpose of his visit to China this time is to continue his previous work, and his whereabouts are very secretive. It is said that his route is to enter Tibet directly from India and then enter Xinjiang. He has already requested a passport from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs but does not want to be subject to China's restrictions. It is reported that the Academia Sinica has sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inquire about the details of its contact with Stein and plans to impose corresponding restrictions, as was done in the case of Sven Hedin and others.</p>
<p>Military Situation</p>
<h3>The Situation of the Two Major Railways in the North</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The Beining and Pinghan Railways are the only two major trunk lines in the north. They are not only important for military affairs but also significant sources of revenue for the government. The Jin faction has long wanted to take control of these two railways, but as of now, although the northern section of the Pinghan Railway is temporarily not a problem, the Jin faction still cannot gain any influence over the entire Beining Railway. The actual situation of the two railways is recorded below:</p>
<p>The entire Beining Railway is 1,500 li long and is currently entirely under the control of the Liaoning faction. Although a certain deputy director dispatched by the Ministry of Railways of the National Government was transferred to Fu Baoheng, the Deputy Chairman of the Northeast Communications Committee, a month ago, this was only a superficial attempt by the Northeast to appease the Jin faction. To this day, the railway bureau still communicates with the Ministry of Railways as usual. The railway is known as "seven inside and eight outside" (700 li inside the pass and 800 li outside the pass), but the actual revenue is the highest from the Tianjin-Beiping section inside the pass. During Wang Cheng's tenure as the director of the railway bureau, 200,000 yuan in subsidies were allocated to the Jin faction every month. Now, Gao Jiyi is acting under the orders of the Ministry of Railways and is completely cutting off the Jin faction. The Jin faction is trying to cooperate with the Northeast, so it is inconvenient to argue with them directly. The railway's current daily revenue is about 120,000 yuan, or 3.6 million yuan per month. After deducting the repayment of British loans, there is still a large surplus. There are also plenty of vehicles. Among all the railways in the country today, its situation is probably the best. In recent months, there has been a great demand for vehicles for military transportation in the north, and vehicles from various railways have been detained by the Jin faction. Only the Beining Railway has not had a single vehicle detained. The railway's special party department was established early on. The members Deng Shaoming, Chen Yilang, Liang Qidu, Chen Shilie, etc., were dispatched by the central government. After a certain faction established a joint office of provincial and regional party departments in Beiping, five staff members of the railway, Li Dean, Feng Jiaying, etc., rose up to organize the so-called joint office of the Beining Railway regional party departments, communicating with the party joint office in Beiping on the one hand and attempting to forcibly take over the railway's special party department on the other. The railway's head office and special party department are both located in the Chinese concession in Tianjin. After being taken over, the party committee members originally dispatched by the central government, Deng Shaoming, Chen Yilang, etc., had to move to the concession to work. This was discovered by Fu Baoheng (dispatched by Liaoning), the deputy director of the railway, who wanted to order the arrest of Li Dean and the other five and send them to Shenyang. Li and others then sought help from the party joint office in Beiping, which asked the Beiping authorities to telegraph the Tianjin Garrison Command to provide protection. At the same time, Deng Shaoming and others also accused Li and others of being communists to the railway bureau, which then ordered the dismissal of Li and others from their positions. However, Deng and others still did not return to work in the Chinese concession. However, the special party department's monthly funding of 5,000 yuan was still issued by the railway bureau. Although Li and others still occupied the special party department, they had no funds and were under strict surveillance by the railway bureau and the party bureau, so they had no room for activity. The above is the recent situation of the Beining Railway.</p>
<p>The section of the Pinghan Railway under the control of the Jin faction is the section from Beiping to Zhengzhou. Its current daily revenue is only over 30,000 yuan, which is only one-quarter of that of the Beining Railway. The total monthly revenue is less than one million yuan. However, at least 600,000 yuan must be allocated to Bing, and the salaries of employees and all expenses of the entire railway require 400,000 yuan per month, which often cannot be paid on time. It is currently about one and a half months in arrears. The shortage of vehicles on this railway is the worst among all the railways in the country today. Buying a first-class ticket and sitting in a third-class car is considered lucky. Sometimes, you can't even buy a ticket. Every time the train departs, it is packed with people. Not only is the interior of the carriages suffocating, but even the roofs of the cars are covered with people. Xie Zongzhou, who was appointed by the Jin faction to take over as the director of the railway bureau, repeatedly reported the actual situation of the shortage of cars and the large number of people to Taiyuan. As a result, Yan issued a strict order to all the troops under his command to return 20 trains to the railway bureau, but ordered the railway bureau to comply with two points: (1) These vehicles must be vacated immediately when the army needs them; (2) The proceeds from the sale of tickets for these vehicles must be handed over to the Jin faction in full. However, troops are still being transported south from time to time, and the passenger cars on the road are still in short supply. A group of speculators in the railway's special party department also attempted to organize a regional joint office to take over the party affairs, but this was stopped by Yan's recent telegram to stop all party activities. The original special party department also stopped its activities in accordance with the order. (May 15th)</p>
<h3>The Banditry in Hunan Province is Expected to Subside</h3>
<p>Hunan Troops Entering Guangxi are Recalled to Suppress Bandits in Southern Hunan</p>
<p>Dai Douyuan Reports on Repelling He Long's Troops</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Since Peng Dehuai captured Pingjiang County on May 8th, bandits and communists have risen up everywhere, taking advantage of the opportunity. Large groups, such as He Long, invaded Jinshi and Li Prefecture, Yun Daiying disrupted the border areas of Nan County, Huarong, and Linxiang, and Chen Jingjin, etc., attacked Pingxiang and Anyuan. As for small groups of armed bandits, they destroyed roads and telegraph lines, attacked local defense forces, and engaged in robbery, arson, and murder in the areas of Liuyang, Liling, Xiangtan, and Chaling, which occurred several times a day. Defending against this and chasing after that, repairing the damage and then having it broken again, there was a situation of being exhausted from running around. The provincial defense forces were indeed thin, and because the Guangxi-Zhang forces attempted to infiltrate Hunan and Tang Shengming's troops arrived in Yongming and Daoxian, He Jian made a major decision to withdraw the troops under Liu Jianxu and Chen Guangzhong that had entered Guangxi to defend against the infiltration of Tang and Zhang's forces. On the one hand, he urgently dispatched the 16th Division under Luo Fanying from Hongjiang back to the province for defense in case of emergencies. On the other hand, he sent additional troops to suppress large communist bandits such as Peng, He, Yun, and Chen in separate routes to curb the bandit forces. In recent days, the Peng bandits have been driven out of Hunan Province, and the He bandits have been heavily damaged. Pingxiang and Anyuan have also been recovered and relieved one after another. Additional troops have been sent to Liuyang to clear the area. As long as they do not relax and increase the efforts of suppression, the bandit forces can be greatly reduced. The following are excerpts from the reports of victories in suppressing bandits from various parties: (1) Changsha Township Clearance Commander and Commander-in-Chief He Junjian, recently received a telegram from Liu Tuanzhang (Yi Jing) and Xu Tuanzhang (Fu Shu) of his command, stating that He Long invaded Jinli and attempted to infiltrate Nan (County) and An (Xiang), forming a united front with Peng (Dehuai) and Huang (Gonglue). The troops departed from Mengxi City, Dayantang, and Qingnitang in three routes and attacked the enemy at Zhangjiachang. They made contact with the enemy at dawn on the day of the attack. The bandits resisted stubbornly and fought fiercely for half a day, killing many enemies. The bandit forces were unable to resist and fled to Aojiazui in Songzi on the Hubei border. In addition to tracking and attacking to eliminate their attempts, this is reported. It is further reported in a telegram from Liu Tuanzhang Yi Jing that He Long attacked for the second time and made contact with our army near Zhangjiachang. The situation was very stubborn. The two battalions of Zhong Jingguang and Tian Baosheng of our regiment launched a fierce attack and crushed the bandits at dawn on the day of the attack, seizing many weapons. The enemy fled to the Hubei border. Xu Tuan's troops pursued them to the Hubei border. One group fled west of Li and is said to have fled to the border of Shimen and Feng Prefecture. In addition to dispatching troops and informing Commander Zhao and the Shimen local defense forces to block them, this is reported. Furthermore, it is confirmed that Zhang He Long and Yun Daiying were commanding the bandit troops near Jia Factory, and this information is reported together. Dai Douyuan respectfully reports, (2) Changsha Township Clearance Commander He Junjian, our Wang Brigade (Dongyuan) supervised his troops, Yang Regiment, the 16th Division's Tian Regiment, and the Independent Brigade's Chen Regiment, and captured Hongqiao on the day of the attack. Wang Regiment (Yingzhao) and Wang Regiment (Zhibin) reached Changshou Street, killing hundreds of bandits along the way. The bandits fled to Xiushui via Longmen Jiangshi. They are currently coordinating with Zhu Yaohua's troops to encircle and suppress the Peng bandits to eliminate their roots. Respectfully submitted, Tao Guang respectfully prints, Also, Tao Guang's telegram, (1) For capturing one gun from the various departments of the Peng bandit Dehuai Kong bandit Hezhong, a reward of twenty yuan will be given. Guns with incomplete parts and miscellaneous guns will be given a reduced reward. For capturing one machine gun, a reward of two hundred yuan will be given. For capturing the bandit leader Peng bandit Dehuai, a reward of one thousand yuan will be given. For the Kong bandit Hezhong and Wu bandit Gai Zhi, each will be rewarded with eight hundred yuan. For capturing a false column commander, a reward of five hundred yuan will be given. The above rewards are reserved and will be paid out as soon as they are handed in. (2) Recently, I received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief He Shan Shen, stating that Commander Zhang Huizan's telegram has been received. The Zhu Brigade (Yaohua) is now clearing the area around Baishui Pai Port. It has been found that the remnants of the Peng bandits, numbering thousands with over a thousand guns, have been fiercely suppressed by the troops of the Xi Cheng Brigade (Guangyao) and have fled from the Dashanyan Tian area in the western part of Anfu into the territory of Lianhua. In addition to ordering a thorough pursuit, teams have been ordered to block them off.</p>
<p>Also, a part of Huang Gonglue's bandit gang, together with the communist bandits of Lianhua, Chen Jingjin and others, gathered a crowd of seven or eight hundred, with over three hundred guns, and besieged Anyuan on the night of the 15th at midnight. The area was originally stationed with one company of the 15th Division's engineering battalion sent by Hunan, and a mining police team (only 50 guns). They responded hastily, already having a sense of timidity. Moreover, because the bandits were numerous and powerful, they dared not fight. After holding out for about two hours, because the bandits did not retreat slightly, the military and police were afraid of suffering losses, so they abandoned Anyuan City. The mining police team took refuge in the mining tunnels, and the army retreated towards Pingxiang. Except for the mining tunnels, Anyuan was occupied by the bandits. The mining bureau staff were captured and killed seven people. All eighty shops and over a hundred families were looted. The house of the mining bureau director, Mr. Lin, was also searched, and Mr. Lin's life and death are unknown. About fifty other people were brutally killed. On the 16th, they also advanced towards Pingxiang. He Jian received the report and sent additional troops, the Zhang Qixiong Brigade of the 15th Division and the Yao Fan Regiment, from Liling to Pingxiang, joining forces with the engineering battalion of the 11th Division of Pingxiang and the local defense forces of Liling and Pingxiang to attack Anyuan. They encountered the bandits in the Jiubanqiao area, killing more than thirty bandits. The rest fled to Anfu. Anyuan was recovered on the night of the 17th. (19th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Changchun Hold Another Exercise</h3>
<p>Using Changchun County as a Target</p>
<p>Trampling Over 2,000 Mu of Farmland</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: Last summer, the Japanese troops stationed in Changchun conducted a combat exercise encircling Changchun in the Xinghuacun area of our Changchun territory, resulting in the destruction of over 1,000 mu of our farmland. The affected farmers later petitioned the Jiaojiao Office to demand compensation from the Japanese side, which has not yet been resolved. Unexpectedly, after the Japanese troops conducted a field exercise at the Japanese station on the 6th of this month, they conducted a second combat exercise in Changchun on the morning of the 13th. In the morning, a garrison brigade came from Gongzhuling, together with the garrison troops that had previously demonstrated at Erdaogou and occupied the military station to practice street fighting, totaling more than 800 troops. They invaded the East Station (location of the Jilin</p>

<p>Changchun Railway Bureau Headquarters) and first carried out an encirclement exercise, then set up sentries, established a communication network, and prohibited pedestrians from passing through South Avenue. At 5 pm, they returned to the West Park area and conducted a joint infantry-artillery battle, aiming at our Changchun County as a target, opening fire and shelling it. For a time, gunpowder smoke filled the air, and the sound of cannons boomed, firing more than 500 shells in total, until 3 am the next morning. Over 2,000 mu of farmland near the city were trampled and destroyed. When the shelling began, the residents were terrified. Those inside the city fled outside the city, and those outside the city fled to distant places. It was not until the Japanese military shelling stopped that the frightened souls were calmed. Afterwards, the Jilin authorities ordered the Changchun County magistrate to investigate, and the Jilin Diplomatic Commissioner's Office protested, but the Japanese consul did not reply.</p>
<p>Also, at 6:30 pm on the 12th, Yang Fulin, a porter at the Changchun Post Office, was sending a friend to take the South Manchuria Railway train. Because he was eager to buy a ticket, he asked someone to buy it from inside. Three Japanese station policemen, Yamamoto and others, caught sight of this and accused him of disrupting order, twisting Yang and beating him violently. Yang's companions tried to persuade them, but they were also beaten severely, and the mailbags were torn open, dumping the mail on the ground. Finally, they fired a gun to intimidate. Saito, the Japanese stationmaster, also cheered from the sidelines, and only stopped when Yang and others were severely injured and unconscious. Zhang Hongjun, the director of the Changchun Post Office, came to negotiate after hearing the news, but did not get anywhere. He only managed to get Yang out and send him to the hospital, but his injuries were very serious and his life was in danger. The Changchun postal community is very angry about this and has reported to the headquarters to negotiate seriously with the Japanese side. (15th)</p>
<h3>Liaoning Post Office</h3>
<p>Second Batch of Heroin from Germany Seized</p>
<p>Provincial Government Consults Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Protest to Germany and Japan</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Postal Administration previously seized a large quantity of heroin purchased by the Japanese Iinuma from Hamburg, Germany. On March 10th, it invited Chinese and foreign personnel and journalists to supervise the burning. Not long after, the Postal Administration again seized 239 pieces of heroin, which was more than double the previous amount. The style was similar to the previously seized mail, also sent from Hamburg, Germany, to the Japanese merchant Fmine in Changchun. The Postmaster Balidi immediately detained all of them and sent a letter to Shenyang Customs Commissioner She Naomen, enclosing a package of mail, explaining the discovery. She Naomen sent the original items to Diller, the Customs Commissioner of Shanhaiguan, for testing. Diller confirmed that they were indeed heroin. For the sake of prudence, he took half of the white items from the mailed items and sent them to Jianghaiguan for testing. The results were undoubtedly heroin. Balidi immediately reported to the Postal General Administration and requested instructions. He was instructed to hand it over to the customs for handling and sent another letter to Shenguan Customs Commissioner She Naomen to return it to his handling. After She reported to the General Customs Administration, he was ordered to handle it jointly with the Customs Supervisor. After receiving the order, She again found five packages from that year, sealed them tightly, and sent them to Jianghaiguan for testing to obtain a second confirmation. Then, he sent a letter to Shenyang Customs Supervisor and Fu Shuangying to discuss the method of destruction. Previously, Customs Supervisor Fu Shuangying had seized postal transport of drugs, and the Provincial Government decided to burn them. This matter is the same and should be submitted to the Provincial Government for approval. After the Provincial Committee decided, it ordered the previous case to be followed, and also informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest to the German and Japanese ministers. At the same time, it also ordered the special envoy to seriously negotiate with the German and Japanese consuls. Regarding the co-verification and preparation for destruction, the destruction committee was still organized by Chen Wenxue, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Wang Jinghuan, Special Commissioner of the Eastern Provinces, Sun Xuchang, Chief of the Police Department, Zhu Shusheng, Chief Prosecutor of the High Court, Bai Mingzhen, Director of the Shenyang Public Security Bureau, Fu Shuangying, Supervisor of the Shenyang Customs, Li Dexin, Mayor of Shenyang, Wang Jiarui, Magistrate of Shenyang County, and Lin Chengxiu, Counselor of the Provincial Government, to take charge. It is said that when the items are burned, Chinese and foreign personnel and journalists will still be invited to participate in order to show caution. The location is still the public sports field along the Xiaohe River. (May 15th)</p>

<p>Robbers Kill Police at Shengzi Temple, Yexie, Under the Jurisdiction of the County. Shengzi Temple in the southern part of Yexie, where Songjiang and Fengxian meet, was reported by the Tinglin long-distance telephone this morning (21st) to the county government, stating that a gang of robbers suddenly arrived at Shengzi Temple last night. The head of the police station of the town's public security police station heard about it and led a team of police officers to rush to the town to block them. They exchanged fire with the bandits. The chief patrol officer was killed, and another patrolman was shot and killed. After receiving the report, the county government immediately appointed Wang Jinsen, a clerk, Chen Rongchu, the police captain, and seven other team members, bailiffs, and forensic officials to take a convenient steamer to Shengzi to investigate.</p>
<p>County Party Department Bans Reactionary Publications. The Propaganda Department of the County Party Affairs Consolidation Committee previously sent personnel to investigate reactionary publications, of which there were dozens. Some changed the cover of textbooks to disguise themselves. There are many tricks, and if prevention and control are slightly neglected, they can easily be mixed in. Several kinds of "New Culture" publications were found in a local bookstore. The contents were all reactionary texts. Therefore, a meeting was convened today to talk to the managers of various bookstores. In the future, all new books must be reviewed before they can be sold. At the end, the department sent a table of reactionary publications to each manager for reference.</p>

<p>Wanted: Hit-and-Run Driver: On the 25th of last month, Shen Jiren, who was driving a fire engine for the Nanhao Street Qiansu Neighborhood, Section 8 fire brigade, drove around on the road. Near the Guangji Bridge, he hit and killed Shi Peiquan, a coppersmith. The Wu County Court sent personnel to investigate. Later, Shen Delin, a member of the fire brigade, was detained and interrogated, but was found not guilty. The court ordered the fire brigade to pay Shi's wife, Zhang, a compensation of 1,000 yuan. However, Shen Jiren fled the scene immediately after the accident and has disappeared without a trace. The local court considers Shen Jiren a major suspect in the case, and has repeatedly tried to summon him, but he has not appeared. Yesterday (the 21st), the court sent a letter to all land and water public security agencies, ordering them to assist in arresting Shen and bringing him to justice.</p>
<p>Silk Shop Owner Hangs Himself: Sun Yangfeng, 52 years old, a shareholder and manager of Tianfengchang Silk Shop in Xizhong City inside Changmen, usually managed the store with great care, resulting in annual profits. In the past month, Sun suffered from mental strain, leading to occasional mental confusion. He consulted Dr. Fang Jiamo, who advised him to rest. However, Sun was stubborn and unwilling to let go of store affairs, leading to a severe deterioration of his mental condition. On the night of the 20th, Sun stayed alone in the upper floor of the store's warehouse. For unknown reasons, he became despondent, used hemp rope to tie up silk goods, and hanged himself from the bed. No one noticed that night. Yesterday (the 21st) at 8 a.m., when the store was opening for business, shop assistant Wu Hanchu went upstairs to get the key to the display window and found Sun hanging from the bed, dead. He called all the shop assistants upstairs, closed the shop, and informed Sun's wife, Chen, who came to the store to arrange funeral matters. The officer Bai of the North Third Precinct ordered the local constable, Han Runqing, to report to the local court to send someone for an inspection. His wife, Chen, and son, Yongqing, petitioned and were granted exemption from inspection. As for the store's affairs, since it was a joint venture, they would be reorganized after the funeral arrangements were made.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Execution of Bandits: Four bandits, including Zuo Zhengming, were arrested for robbing the home of Tao Ganbo in Laqitu, Bacheng Township.

<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>Merchant Ship Robbed En Route: The Zhaoshang Yuqing small steamers, which have been running between Zhujiajiao and Shanghai for more than ten years, were suddenly robbed yesterday. The Zhaoshang steamer departed from Zhujiajiao and, when it reached about three miles from Ji Wang Temple, eight people in a ferry boat approached. Initially, they were thought to be passengers, but after boarding the ship, they pulled out pistols and prevented the ship from sailing. They searched all the passengers and their luggage. However, most of the passengers were laborers and did not have much to lose. Only a passenger surnamed [omitted] who was disembarking at Huangdu was said to be carrying 800 yuan in banknotes to a Shanghai bank, which was also robbed completely.</p>
<p>Zhang Ye Sues Her Husband: Zhang Ye, 30 years old, from the north gate of this city, claims her husband, Zhang Mingjun, works as a clerk in Zhenjiang and earns a substantial monthly income. They have been married for many years and have a son and a daughter. Recently, her husband married a concubine in Zhenjiang and lives separately. Zhang Ye is often treated coldly by her in-laws in Qingpu and does not receive any money for the children's clothes or expenses. She had no choice but to report the situation to the county party headquarters for help. The county party headquarters forwarded the letter to the Provincial Women's Federation for handling. The federation asked Zhang Ye to come to the province to explain the situation. After finding the case to be true, they summoned Zhang Mingjun and tried to persuade him. Zhang initially acted cunning, but after repeated persuasion, he agreed to provide Zhang Ye with ten yuan per month for expenses. Room and board would still be at the in-laws' house, and her husband would be responsible for medical expenses or additional expenses for the children. Zhang Ye was satisfied and returned to Qingpu the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Outcome of the Petition Regarding Municipal Funds and Assets: After the Wuxi Municipal Preparatory Office was ordered to close, the municipal affairs were taken over by the relevant county bureaus. The Municipal Engineering and Donation Offices were also taken over by the Construction and Finance Bureaus, which assigned staff to start working. However, the management of municipal funds and assets has caused disputes. The County Party Consolidation Committee invited representatives from the First and Second District Party Headquarters and mass organizations to hold a joint meeting. They resolved to appoint representatives to go to the province to petition the party and government. Representatives from the County Party Consolidation Committee, District Party Headquarters, and the agricultural, labor, commercial, youth, women's consolidation committees, the Municipal Education Association, and the National Guidance Daily were appointed. On the 19th, they went to the province to submit a petition to the Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs, stating their wishes and requesting responses to three matters: (1) Whether Cao Hengzhi, Yang Hanxi, and others were petitioning the province in the name of citizen representatives; (2) Whether the province had given instructions regarding the Qichang charter; (3) The province's opinion on handling this matter. Chairman Ye and Director Hu expressed that Yang and others petitioned the province in the name of citizen representatives, advocating that the municipal affairs be returned to the First District Office for management and that a Municipal Asset Management Committee be formed. However, the province had already decided that the county would select impartial local people to serve on the committee and first draft a charter to be submitted to the provincial department for approval. Everything should be handled in accordance with the approved charter. If there are local bullies mixed in, not only can the citizens object, but the province will not approve it. In the future, a better plan should be devised to suit the local situation. The representatives expressed their satisfaction and left. They then went to the Provincial Party Headquarters, where various committee members met with them and stated that the party headquarters should conduct effective supervision. The candidates for the municipal asset management committee should be agreed upon by the local government and the party headquarters. They also advocated that citizens should organize a municipal research association to promote the city's development. The representatives followed these instructions and returned to Wuxi yesterday, actively organizing a municipal research association.</p>
<p>Scheduled Opening of the Wuxi-Cheng Bus Route: The Wuxi-Cheng Highway and the Wuxi-Cheng Bus Company are actively proceeding with the preparations for the opening of the road, as the entire project is nearing completion.

<p>Strict Punishment for Opium Traffickers: In February of this year, the county government arrested Xi Changfu for trafficking in opium, along with evidence. It was also learned that Xi was a railway worker and that the opium transported from Shanghai to Wuxi was insured by Xi. After repeated interrogations, Xi initially denied the charges. Yesterday, Zhou, the investigating officer, summoned the senior police officer who carried out the arrest and other witnesses. After the evidence was confirmed, Xi Changfu was sentenced to three years in prison and fined 2,000 yuan.

<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>Disputes Arise Again Over Shaoxing People Encroaching on Sand Land Across Borders: Since the 13th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, the Xiaonanhui sand land in Li Hai has been the subject of disputes among sand people over land ownership. The former County Magistrate Tang ruled that the land should be confiscated by the Jingzheng Academy. This was the beginning of the county's education fund. Later, in the 24th and 31st years of Guangxu, there were successive additions. County Magistrates Tang, Chu, and Ye gave licenses to the sand people who contracted to cultivate the land, and there was peace for decades. During the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 3rd years of the Republic of China, the sand land was eroded by floods, losing over a thousand acres. By the 13th and 4th years, the land had collapsed and resurfaced. The former Senate re-measured the land and issued licenses to the original contractors as usual. However, in the 15th year, Tong Rong, the director of the Shaoxing Reclamation Bureau from another county, sold over 600 acres of sand land in that area. In the 16th year, the political situation changed, and the Reclamation Bureau was renamed the Sand Field Bureau. Tong Rong managed to be appointed as the director of the Yu-Shang Sand Field Branch and illegally sold over 1,400 acres of sand land in that area. The buyers in both instances were Feng Meiyan, who used the pseudonym Yu Shengjie from Jiangkou, Shaoxing County, and Yi Jiachang and others from Xihui Zui. They forged documents and illegally planted signs across the border. At that time, all the local legal organizations in the county listed the evidence and telegraphed the province to fight for their rights. In the 17th year, the Yu-Shang Sand Field Branch established a Sand Field Office in Baiguan. The education fund association registered with the office, totaling over 2,000 acres of new and old land. In the spring of the 18th year, the Sand Field Bureau established an office in Li Hai Suo, and the education fund property association reported the measurement of the land. The previous registration and measurement, except for the undisputed 1,800 acres of old land that had not collapsed, showed that the 394 acres of new land were subject to disputes due to the over 2,000 acres sold by Tong Rong in two instances. As a result, our Yu County's educational public property suffered many disputes. The Ministry of Education, the Provincial Government, the National Zhejiang University, and the Departments of Finance and Education approved the investigation and found the claims to be true. Unexpectedly, on May 5th of this year, Feng Meiyan, Yi Jiachang of Shaoxing County, and Wang Fushun and other vagrants from Nanhui, along with armed police from the Sun Duan Public Security Branch, encircled 2,800 acres of dikes in the Xiaonanhui area. The original contractors were extremely indignant. They reported the matter to the County Education Fund Association, which requested the County Government to send police four times to stop them, but to no avail. On the 19th, over 130 original contractors, including Xie Jiyan, Chen Bingzhao, Wang Yuelai, and Chen Yuanying, were so angry that they could not contain themselves. They gathered at the county government and demanded that police officers be sent to repel the visiting police and that the provincial government be telegraphed to order the Shaoxing County Government to order the Sun Duan Public Security Branch not to interfere across the border in the future, so as to clarify the county boundaries and suppress the seeds of chaos.</p>

<p>Change of Director of the Huang Gu Lin Public Security Branch: The former Director of the Huang Gu Lin Public Security Branch in Yin County, Chen Shangli, was removed from his position after being accused of a case by someone in the province. It is now reported that the Department of Civil Affairs has appointed Ma Qi to replace him. He has arrived and taken office.</p>
<p>Tragedy on the Yin-Feng Provincial Highway: The Jiang-Feng section (from Jiangkou to Fenghua City) of the Yin-Feng Provincial Highway Bureau is scheduled to reopen on the 20th. However, there are still several sections of the road surface that need to be repaired. Around 8:00 a.m. on the 18th, over thirty road workers were using a road roller to roll the road surface at Xiang Ling, near Chang Ting Village. While going down the hill, one of the workers stopped to pick up a sunshade, causing the road roller to roll down freely, crushing three people to death. Two had their heads crushed, and one had his chest crushed. The three bodies were later collected by the road bureau.</p>

<p>Banditry Occurs in Sikou Town: Yesterday (the 14th) at 6:00 p.m., a group of over thirty bandits, each carrying handguns, wooden clubs, and long knives, gathered at Niujiaowu outside Sikou Town in the north of the county. They entered the town through Xiaojie Street, firing their guns as a show of force. The merchants were having dinner when they suddenly heard the gunshots. The bandits were fierce, and everyone was panicking and at a loss. They fled in all directions. The bandits then proceeded to the upper street and looted the major shops, tying up the owner of Shun Chang Store and demanding money. They then went through Yujia Lane in the middle street and went straight to the home of Yu Xintian, a branch of the Hongyuan Yongwu Tea Shop. They broke down the door, rushed in, and searched everywhere, taking all the cash and family jewelry stored in the shop. They gathered at Shangdiantan, wrapped the loot in bundles, and shouted as they went to Yanchuan, Sixi, and Xichongyuan before heading south. After the incident, the store owners investigated the losses. The Yu Xintian family suffered the greatest loss, with an estimated total of over 30,000 yuan in cash, jewelry, and damaged items. The second-largest loss was at the Yi Tai Grocery Store, where 1,400 yuan in cash was robbed. The Ren Tai Cloth Store lost about 500 yuan in silk and foreign goods. Shun Chang Rice Store lost several hundred yuan. The other stores, including Tong Fayuan, Zhu Huatang, Shen Long, Yi Yuhe, and Yi Shengchang, all lost between a hundred and several dozen yuan. The shops on the lower street did not suffer any losses.</p>

<p>Tragic News of the Family of Executed Bandit: Xu Dai, the biological mother of Xu Guorong, the bandit who was executed, Xu Tang, the adoptive mother, and Xu Guo, the wife, all attempted suicide by opium or gold ingestion due to the loss of their family. Xu's wife even tried to strangle her two daughters, but a Western doctor was called to rescue them. The poison was too strong, and they are all in critical condition. However, in addition to the Hong Shun Xiang Timber Company that Xu's family jointly opened with Wang Hanchen in Beiwai, there is also a timber company in Sanhe, as well as a lot of real estate and land, totaling tens of thousands of gold. Xu Guorong's brother, Guoliang, heard that the government was planning to confiscate the family property. He has asked all sectors to request that the confiscation be waived in order to maintain their livelihood.</p>
<p>The Entire Town of Gao Liuji Was Robbed: The town of Gao Liuji in the west was robbed clean by over a hundred bandits the night before last. No household was spared. Before leaving, the bandits set fire to the town, burning down most of the houses. People have been coming to the city to report the case.</p>

<h3>Chronicle of the Voyage East by the Chinese Athlete Delegation (I)</h3>
<p>(Jointly Recorded by Dong Shouyi, Wang Xiliang, and Sun Sijing on the Taiyo Maru)</p>
<p>Zhang Boling Convenes a Meeting with Instructions and Encouragement</p>
<p>Zhang Lingjia as the Chief Captain of the Athlete Delegation</p>
<p>The 9th Far Eastern Games, scheduled to be held in Tokyo, Japan, on the 24th of this month, will see the participation of over 130 Chinese athletes and staff members. They departed on the morning of the 15th, fully equipped, aboard the Taiyo Maru, sailing east. The details were recorded in a previous report. Now, having learned about the events and living conditions of the athlete delegation and staff members during the past two days on board, we will briefly describe them to inform those concerned about sports.</p>
<p>After boarding the ship, each athlete sought their own cabin and room, dividing into their respective quarters. Some shared rooms with two people, while others shared with four, all according to the pre-assigned rooms. Female athletes were assigned to first-class cabins, while male athletes were assigned to second-class cabins. Although the cabins were divided by class, the cleanliness of the ship's facilities and the thoughtfulness of its arrangement are said to make it one of the best ships on the Pacific route. The Chinese athletes felt comfortable in their daily routines and movements. Furthermore, the instructors were devoted and caring, so all the athletes were able to feel mentally satisfied and physically comfortable. This is truly what Dr. Zhang Boling meant when he said that the personality and spirit of the athletes are of utmost importance. Athlete meals are scheduled in the dining hall, with breakfast at 9 AM, lunch at 1 PM, and dinner at 7 PM each day. The teams eat together, side by side at the same table, in order to connect with each other and cultivate their character. The staff seats are located in the center of the hall, so all the athletes in the hall can clearly see any announcements. For athlete entertainment, outdoor activities are available during the day, and the deck is equipped with a swimming pool, table tennis, and various games. In the evenings, movies are screened in the main lounge. With comfort in dining and accommodation, coupled with adequate entertainment, the athletes' mental and physical well-being will undoubtedly be enhanced immensely. The details of each day on the ship will be recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>May 15th</h3>
<p>After the athletes boarded the ship, they went to find their places, with women staying in first class, men in second class, and staff elsewhere. Once everything was settled, they gathered in groups of three or five, strolling on the deck. Some gazed into the distance, some played games, and some chatted and laughed with each other. People from all over the north, south, east, and west, as well as overseas Chinese and women, were gathered on one ship. Their postures and attire varied greatly. Those from the north were upright and strong, those from the east were taller, those from the south were heroic and lively, and those from the Yangtze River area were graceful and agile. It was enough to represent the customs and habits of various places. Therefore, the deck scene was colorful and full of fun. At lunchtime, they entered in a line, each team joining together. The staff seats were located in the center of the hall. It was a happy gathering. After the meal, at about 2 PM, Hao Boyang convened a meeting of the entire Chinese athlete delegation and introduced Dr. Zhang Boling to speak about the mission of this trip and Hao Boyang's report. Then, each leader reported on the affairs of their respective teams, and they dispersed happily at 5 PM. Some athletes returned to their rooms to rest, while others exercised and played games. At this time, the Chinese basketball team, led by coach Dong Shouyi, performed basketball-style exercises on the deck for half an hour. These ten strong men were drenched in sweat.</p>
<p>At 7 PM, dinner was served. During the meal, the wind was gentle, but then it picked up, and the huge ship seemed uneasy. The ship's body shook quite a bit, and the northern athletes looked like they were about to throw up, so they rushed back to their rooms to lie down. Overseas Chinese and those from southern China ate and drank greedily, eating a hearty meal, as if nothing was happening. The joy of those who didn't get seasick was evident. At 10 PM, everyone returned to their rooms to sleep, and thus the daily life at sea came to an end.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Chinese Athlete Delegation Meeting</h3>
<p>At 2 PM on May 15th, the Chinese athlete delegation held a plenary meeting in the second-class dining room of the Taiyo Maru. Chairman Hao Boyang, representative Zhang Boling spoke, saying that although the underdevelopment of Chinese sports has been affected by the political situation, there has been good progress in Chinese sports in the three years since the 8th Far Eastern Games. China has not yet been unified in terms of the political situation, but today in the sports field, athletes from the east, west, north, men and women can gather together to form a whole team, representing our country to attend the Far Eastern Games. This is enough to show that the people of our country are originally unified, without distinction between each other, and it can also let foreigners know that the reason why our country is not unified is only political. In the past few Far Eastern Games, we relied heavily on Westerners. Since the 8th Games, we have been fully responsible by ourselves. Especially this time, we are traveling eastward with such a full spirit, which shows the optimism of our country's sports future. The goal of the Far Eastern Games is not in winning or losing. Winning is certainly gratifying, but losing is also honorable. It is only up to us to work hard to express the purpose of sports. Leaders and athletes must know that the overall spirit is particularly good this time, which can represent that we have won half of the real victory in this Far Eastern Games. Furthermore, this trip to Japan, all measures should show the spirit of our great nation. In previous years, China and Japan both learned from the West as students, but Japan's progress is so rapid that it can almost be our teacher, so we should be more self-motivated and must try our best to make progress. If there are any points of dissatisfaction with the Games, if you want to file a protest, do not act alone or withdraw from a certain competition, or have any irregular behavior. We must protest according to the procedures. Our entire team must have the spirit of doing our best to support the success of the Games, and we must not have a prejudice to destroy it. In short, to achieve the above goals, first, each of us must take responsibility, not just rely on a few leaders. Second, we must obey the training of the instructors. Then, Chairman Hao Boyang reported: (1) Athletes must wear their badges and write their names on them so that they can get to know each other. (2) All athletes are not allowed to visit the B-deck. (3) Each team should set its own time for training on the ship every day. (4) Be sure to dress neatly during meals. Finally, the entire team elected two male flag bearers, Li Guochen and Lu Ming, and two female athletes, and elected Zhang Lingjia as the chief captain of the athlete delegation.</p>

<p>The Athletes Take the Train to Tokyo That Night</p>
<p>Our country's athlete representatives participating in this year's Far Eastern Games, together with various staff members, totaled 167 people, led by Hao Boyang and Zhang Boling. They sailed east from Shanghai on the Taiyo Maru on the 15th of this month. At 4 PM on the 17th of this month, the ship arrived in Kobe. Those who went to the pier to greet them included various groups in Kobe and numerous students from Tongwen and Huaqiang, totaling about 3,000 people. As soon as the ship docked, the school students played music and sang the national anthem, waving the national flag. The athletes also raised their hats in return. Afterwards, they disembarked one after another, full of energy. Newspaper reporters took pictures one after another. They then boarded more than 30 cars prepared by the Chinese Association and drove in succession to the Association, where a welcoming tea party was held. The Vice Consul of Kobe, Ren Jiafeng, delivered a welcoming speech, followed by a response from Zhang Boling, who said, "Today, upon arriving in Japan, we have received a warm welcome from all of you fellow overseas Chinese, for which we are sincerely grateful. The Far Eastern Games have been held nine times so far, three times in the Philippines and three times in Japan. Each time our team has gone abroad, we have never had a more abundant spirit than this time. Therefore, we can be confident that the results this time will definitely be better than before. Our participation in the Games is not for a few trophies and a few silver cups. Winning or losing is irrelevant. We are only expressing our spirit of unity, because now foreigners don't know that our country has been divided into several countries. Look at the athletes who have come this time from as far north as Harbin and as far south as Hong Kong, as well as from distant Nanyang and Honolulu. There is no distinction between north and south. The spirit of unity is extremely strong. We are grateful to all of you for donating to the travel expenses. Now, on behalf of all the athletes, I would like to express my gratitude." Afterwards, the event was dismissed. The Kobe Chinese Boy Scouts led the way to the Central Pavilion for dinner. That night, they took the express train at 8:23 PM to Tokyo and arrived the next day, lodging at the Kanda Youth Hall.</p>

<h3>Statistics on Education Expenses in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province Over the Years</h3>
<p>A Threefold Increase Compared to Previous Years</p>
<p>The actual educational expenses spent by various counties in Jiangsu Province within the four-year compulsory education stage of primary schools and primary school junior departments from the first year of the Republic of China to the seventeenth year of the Republic of China have been compiled by the Jiangsu Provincial Preparatory Office for Compulsory Education. A statistical table of primary school expenses in Jiangsu counties over the years has been prepared after multi-faceted investigations. The increase or decrease is compared separately according to the year and county. Since the Republic of China, the rise and fall of the educational expenses in Jiangsu Province can be clearly understood. The total amount of actual expenses for each year (61 counties in Jiangsu) is recorded below:</p>
<p>Year 1: 1,389,894 yuan</p>
<p>Year 2: 1,552,538 yuan</p>
<p>Year 3: 1,596,921 yuan</p>
<p>Year 4: 1,704,129 yuan</p>
<p>Year 5: 1,910,744 yuan</p>
<p>Year 6: 1,960,784 yuan</p>
<p>Year 7: 2,035,057 yuan</p>
<p>Year 8: 2,202,734 yuan</p>
<p>Year 9: 2,396,610 yuan</p>
<p>Year 10: 2,504,999 yuan</p>
<p>Year 11: 2,619,958 yuan</p>
<p>Year 12: 2,710,875 yuan</p>
<p>Year 13: 2,776,699 yuan</p>
<p>Year 14: 2,851,435 yuan</p>
<p>Year 15: 2,605,954 yuan</p>
<p>Year 16: 3,291,284 yuan</p>
<p>Year 17: 4,198,498 yuan</p>
<p>According to the above statistics, Year 17 increased by 2,808,604 yuan compared to Year 1, a threefold increase. However, the expenses for Year 15 decreased by 245,481 yuan compared to the previous year, likely due to the disruption of schools in various counties during the early stages of the revolution in Jiangsu, leading to the diversion of funds. This shows that the education sector is closely related to local security. After Year 17, with the gradual arrival of the Tutelage Period, compulsory education gained increasing importance.</p>
<h3>市宣傅部指導科議定</h3>
<p>Measures for Preventing Cultural Aggression</p>
<p>The Guidance Section of the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee held its fifth section meeting yesterday (the 20th) at 2:00 PM. The meeting was chaired by Xu Xingchu, with Zhou Hanmei as the recorder. The following items were discussed: (1) The request to approve the central government's plan to expand propaganda based on the key points of propaganda for this week was approved; (2) The measures for commemorating the May 30th Massacre, already drafted, were approved; (3) The measures for commemorating the anniversary of Premier Sun Yat-sen's interment on June 1st, already drafted, were approved, and it was resolved to submit them to the minister for submission to the Municipal Executive Committee; (4) The measures for preventing imperialist cultural aggression, already drafted, were approved, and it was resolved to submit them to the minister for submission to the Municipal Executive Committee. The meeting was adjourned. Appended below are the measures for preventing imperialist cultural aggression passed by the section: 1. Non-citizens of the Republic of China or organizations not entirely composed of citizens of the Republic of China shall not be allowed to establish primary schools, kindergartens, or normal schools for educating Chinese people. All teachers and staff in primary schools or kindergartens shall be limited to citizens of the Republic of China. 2. Starting from the 19th year of the Republic (1930), graduates of church schools that have not been approved and registered by Chinese authorities shall not receive the same treatment as graduates of registered schools. Church schools that offer religious subjects or hold religious ceremonies on campus shall not be allowed to register. Church schools that have been rejected for registration or have failed to apply for registration by the deadline shall be ordered to close within a set time limit. 3. All church schools applying for registration shall be thoroughly investigated by the Education Department or the Municipal/County Education Bureau. After the application is forwarded and approved for registration, the original investigating agency shall be responsible for regularly examining whether there are any instances of privately conducting religious propaganda. If any violations of the regulations are found, they shall be immediately dealt with. For all church schools that have been approved for registration, the principal shall be directly appointed by the competent Chinese authorities, but the school's board of directors shall have the power of supervision. If the principal is deemed incompetent, the board of directors shall be allowed to submit a request to the competent Chinese authorities to investigate and appoint another person. 4. No religious organizations shall use the names of preaching halls or theological seminaries to gather Chinese children to teach them religious subjects. Organizations that are actually engaged in religious research shall not be allowed to have underage citizens of the Republic of China participate. Violators shall be immediately shut down. 5. Although the YMCA in the country ostensibly promotes moral, intellectual, physical, and social development, in reality, it propagates Christianity, seducing young people and is clearly an instrument of imperialist cultural aggression. Chinese educational institutions should take over and manage them independently. 6. All organizations with religious characteristics must be handled in accordance with the organizational plan for people's groups promulgated by the Central Committee of the Party. Publications of all church schools or organizations shall be submitted to the local highest party headquarters for review on a regular basis. 7. If foreigners, under the pretext of cultural investigation, go to various parts of China and develop antiquities without authorization, all items shall be confiscated and they shall be deported.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter · Hai · Ke</h3>
<p>Wife: Why do you always just listen to the radio and not like listening to me?</p>
<p>Husband: Because it always has good music and good songs that please my ears, and it never scolds or blames me.</p>
<p>Girl A: I'm getting married soon.</p>
<p>Girl B: How come I don't know anything about it?</p>
<p>Girl A: Because my lover and I advocate a secret marriage, we agreed not to let anyone know and solemnly swore that whoever tells will be less than human.</p>
<p>A: I don't understand how you have so much money to take your girlfriend out to restaurants all the time.</p>
<p>B: It's a secret. I only pick girlfriends who are gaining weight to go with me. They're so afraid of getting fatter that they don't dare eat much, so I don't have to spend too much.</p>
<p>A: No one in your family trusts doctors. What happens if you get a really bad illness?</p>
<p>B: We can die freely and avoid being force-fed medicine and undergoing the misery of surgery.</p>

<p>Girl B: You should be careful. He sent his heart to me last time. I cherished it so much, but he complained that I broke his heart.</p>
<h3>A Startling Glimpse · Wu · Mo · Xi</h3>
<p>On the 18th, I visited the 30th-anniversary celebration at the Toa Dobun Shoin College at the invitation of a friend. I arrived at the college at 2:00 PM. Guests were given a well-made commemorative booklet. We first went to the music room to listen to music. In addition to famous Western pieces, there was a harmonica ensemble, which was quite wonderful. Finally, there was a shamisen ensemble by the "Miyako no Haru Koto Tomo no Kai." Two men played the "shakuhachi," which looks like a flute but is thicker, and its sound is very clear. Five women played stringed instruments that resemble the Chinese zither. I heard that each instrument costs 300 yuan. They sang while playing, and the sound was harmonious, somewhat like Sanskrit chanting, both mournful and moving. It lasted a long time before it ended. After that, we visited the "ryosai" (寮祭). "Ryosai" refers to the free arrangement of each classroom. Everywhere there was deep meaning, and mostly they were critiques of current events in China and Japan, such as the austerity policies in Japan and the political struggles between Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan in China. Among them, what I appreciated most was the surface and the interior of the Four Horse Road. On the surface, there were publications from various bookstores, seemingly to improve culture, but inside were sex histories, spring books, and prostitutes, all of which lead people to depravity. It is impossible not to nod in agreement after seeing this. Another was the love suicide incident of the Japanese writer Takeo Arishima. The room was decorated with a grave door and weeds, all in a mournful green, with a cold wind whistling. Two skeletons were kissing among the reeds, and the title was "Kiss of the Spirits." It was truly a work full of artistic meaning. Others, such as a room with only one hole left, and looking inside revealed only darkness, with the words "The Current State of China" written in large letters outside the room, the meaning was clear and thought-provoking. After the viewing, we visited the library again. I entered the research room. All kinds of magazines from China and abroad were available, but I paid particular attention to the research on China. There was a bookshelf with dozens of volumes of elaborately bound books, and there were five or six books specifically studying the content of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War. It was astonishing to see this. Another room displayed photographs of the situation in the Chinese interior, as detailed as the scenery of Guizhou and the upper reaches of the Ou River in Zhejiang, and as detailed as the ancient sites near Xi'an, all of which are not easily seen by us, and many of them have artistic value. But what was most startling was the printed matter of the May 15 Incident. Such as the manifestos of May 15, May 17, and May 19, and the slogans of the May 30th, all of which were collected in detail and compiled into volumes. As for the various declarations of the National Government, they were all mounted like album pages. Various anti-communist and anti-Chiang propaganda materials were classified and filed. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese have been planning for a long time and value research over lip service, which is far beyond what the people of the old great powers can hope to achieve. I heard from a friend that the school's operating expenses are 3 million yuan per year, all paid by the Japanese government. Even Central University and Jiaotong University in China only have 2 million yuan per year. Each month, students are sent to China for inspection, while Chinese students are sent to Japan. When they go, Japanese people greet them everywhere, and they are entertained every day. Therefore, what they get is only superficial, and they only enjoy a taste of material pleasure. On the lawn inside the school gate, there is a newly erected bronze statue of the former president, Nezu. This person was the most vocal advocate for the establishment of the Toa Dobun Shoin College and was also a schemer for invading China. This time, three of the Japanese Cabinet Ministers specifically sent people to China to give instructions. One of them was an elderly duke. It's just a small school, but it is valued so much. The reason for this is worth pondering deeply. I felt uneasy after returning, so I wrote this messily to tell my countrymen.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Bronze Drum of Zhuge in Jinshan · Tao · An</h3>
<p>In a certain Brahma house of Jiangtian Temple in Zhenjiang, there is a bronze drum of Zhuge Liang, which he used to boost the morale of soldiers when he assisted the Shu Han. It is similar in size to ordinary ones, made of firm and heavy material, and dark in color. When struck, it rings clearly like a chime stone. The casting and painting are extremely refined. The pattern engraved on the face resembles the planets orbiting the sun, with twelve corners, just like the party emblem. This is purely a coincidence and nothing to be surprised about. After the revolutionary army settled in Jingjiang, the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun was raised all over the north and south of the Yangtze River. The monks of the temple thought it resembled the painting on the drum surface and regarded it as mysterious. They used it to solicit money from people. From then on, visitors from all directions scrambled to view and donate. This bronze drum of Zhuge, which had been unknown for thousands of years, became famous after this propaganda. In the future, it will be immortalized with the Ling Mountain Pagoda.</p>
<h3>A Record of an Industrialist in Pudong Awakening · Tao · An</h3>
<p>Ling Xiufeng of Qituan, Nanhui, is the owner of the Jinlun Towel Factory. Today, among domestic towels, the products of the Sanyou Industrial Society and the Jinlun Towel Factory are the best. The Jinlun Towel Factory was founded after May 9, 1915. At that time, Ling was stimulated by Japan and believed that only by revitalizing industry could the national humiliation be avenged, and only by promoting domestic goods could the motherland be saved. However, although Ling had this ambition, he did not have much capital. He set up a towel factory in his hometown, named Jinlun, with twenty machines. On the one hand, he hired rural women to weave towels, and on the other hand, he led his wife and children to bleach, dry, and decorate them. Therefore, although he was a factory owner, he was barefoot and disheveled all day long, personally doing menial labor. People only thought he was a worker in the factory and did not know he was the owner of the factory. After the goods were made, he took them to Shanghai to sell them to merchants. When he sold them, he wore a coarse cloth and trudged through the market. People thought he was a salesman and did not know he was the owner of the factory. At that time, the merchants in Shanghai, because his brand was not well-known and his sales were not widespread, deliberately made trouble and suppressed him. Ling lowered his head and humbly improved the goods that needed to be improved. He made efforts to lower the prices that could be lowered, so that the merchants had no excuse. Therefore, his costs were higher than others, and his profits were lower than others. As a result, in just a few years, the products of the Jinlun Factory gained people's trust and sales greatly increased. Therefore, since the factory was established fifteen years ago, the number of machines and the number of employees have increased every year. Today, the factory has as many as 800 machines and employs thousands of workers. It is really different from when it was first established. Today, its towels are sold not only in various provinces but also in various parts of the world. Today, the Chinese people use domestic towels, making foreign goods disappear. Ling has made a great contribution to this. Therefore, Ling can be said to be a successful entrepreneur. However, in the early days of its establishment, he was willing to do menial labor when shipping goods and was willing to endure people's arrogance when selling them. Only because of his perseverance did he have today's success. I record this to tell the entrepreneurs of today's revitalization industry.</p>

<h3>Red Carpet</h3>
<p>Seven Star Lamp, Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>The other night, I saw the 90-year-old Sun Juxian perform the Seven Star Lamp on the Shanghai stage. This play starts with the burning of the Calabash Valley. Old Ju's Kongming was supported by two pageboys when he came on stage. His steps were quite steady. He was not slowed down by wearing a net cap and thick-soled boots. He is truly a person of longevity. The order of sending generals was well-organized. His singing was also well-tuned, which proves that his memory and hearing are still strong. The second time he came on stage, he heard Ma Dai report that the landmines buried in the Calabash Valley had been destroyed by the heavy rain, and Sima Yi and his son and Wei Yan had all escaped. However, he suddenly stood up from his seat, and a look of anxiety appeared on his face at the same time. Then he sat back down. This expression is most suitable for the quiet Kongming. It is much more appropriate than the usual shouting of "Aww." After sitting down, he did not make useless complaints. He immediately said, "If Wei Yan comes back, there will be a quarrel." This point is where Kongming's knowledge of what is urgent surpasses others. Therefore, he falsely accused Ma Dai to appease Wei Yan's anger. Old Ju showed Kongming's alertness in feigning anger and smiling falsely. Everyone in the audience nodded and smiled. When the flag bearer delivered the order, Kongming asked about the reason for the flag bearer's mistake in revealing the truth that he ate little and was busy with many things, which was due to his greed for Sima Yi's banquet. He became anxious, his beard trembled, and he angrily pointed at the flag bearer with his feather fan. The flag bearer retreated from the left side of the seat to the right side, forming an arc. The feather fan also followed from left to right. This is extremely vivid. This old man is truly not old. The "Looking Up to the Sky" segment of the Erhuang Yuanban has a pure and rich flavor. The ceremony of worshiping the lamp was first escorted by the manager of the stage, Chang Yunheng, and the famous amateur singer, Mr. Chen Gangshu. Old Ju suddenly broke away from the two and walked alone to the Nine Dragon Mouth, singing the slow Erhuang segment "Sighing for Emperor Gao." How strong he is! This segment has not been shortened. The "Xing" character in "Guangwu Xing" and the "Ya" character in "Ba Zhu Qiya" were dragged out with long tunes, and the charm was as vast as in the past. The words of the prayer for expelling stars were elegant and sincere. Tan Xinpei would never have this talent. The "Ji" character in "Huang Tian Hou Tu He Qi Si Ji" used three trembling tones to conclude. The sound was unusually loud and full of emotion. This is Old Ju's unique skill. The "Zhuge Liang Ye Fei Shi" segment of the Yuanban was a wonderful expression of the essence of the performance. The Erhuang Yaoban, which was on the verge of death, used high notes in two places, and the capture and release were appropriate. Listening to it was like taking a dose of Qingxin powder. When singing the "Shi" character in "Wuchang Dao Wan Shi Xiu," he repeatedly trembled his head as if spitting blood. The lingering sound also trembled. It was truly very tragic. Just these few sentences of singing and a few expressions are enough to surpass a whole play of a mediocre young sheng (an actor who plays young male roles). Mr. Chen Gangshu, Old Ju's proud disciple, recorded the above three major Erhuang segments of this play at the Great China Record Company the year before last. It has Old Ju's charm. Since the old man did not leave any real records, Gangshu's film is especially precious. It is the absolute best of the Fu Sun school. (Gratitude)</p>
<p>It is very popular in London to keep ponies. They weigh less than eighty pounds, and their fur is of various colors, all of which are bright and dazzling. They are docile and lively, very comparable to horses. Most fashionable young women treat them like pet dogs and always take them out for walks. These horses come from the Shetland Islands in the west and are quite expensive. The United States has also recently purchased a large number of them for children to drive, but they did not adapt to the climate and many of them died.</p>
<p>British Labour MP Ms. Eleanor Rathbone has recently proposed repealing the Women's Nationality Act of 1870 and creating a new law that "any British woman who marries a foreigner should still retain her British nationality, unless she voluntarily takes the nationality of her husband." It has now been passed by Parliament and promulgated for implementation.</p>
<p>British women have recently liked to wear monocles. Those who advocate it most strongly include Labour MP Ms. Eleanor Rathbone, the famous novelist Ms. Joan, and many artists and educators. Once this trend started, American women immediately followed suit.</p>
<p>The number of divorce cases in the United States has been increasing very rapidly in recent years. The government has no way to stop it. According to the new statistics for 1929, the number of divorces has increased from 195,939 to 214,495. The increase rate in most provinces is 74%. If the ratio of marriage to divorce is compared, it is 6 to 1.</p>
<p>The Chicago School of Aesthetic Makeup claims that American women will tend to have yellow skin this summer. After bathing in the sea, they will also take sunbaths to burn their skin and turn it yellow. In this way, the vermilion color between the lips must also be thickened at the same time. The harmony of the two colors will complement each other. They are now re-manufacturing lip gloss to make it fragrant and greasy. It is estimated that the sales of this lip gloss will be more than 200 million.</p>

<p>However, Liu Xing Shu had already accepted the translation work. This was like a fixed order in the business world, and the goods had to be delivered on time. He had no choice but to rush to finish it day and night. Fortunately, his writing was always very quick, and he was good at foreign languages. Translating novels is not like translating scientific books, which have all kinds of scientific terms that need to be revised. Translating novels only requires the writing to be fluent and smooth, especially detective novels, which must be consistent from beginning to end and not contradict each other. Indeed, every day he went back, from ten o'clock to one o'clock, he could translate a lot of words. And sometimes when he was happy, or when a section of events in the translation, it had to be translated in one go, he would not put down his pen until he heard the one o'clock chime. Then he would lose his interest. Sometimes his midnight work went to two or three o'clock before he went to sleep. Although Liu Xing Shu boasted that he only slept six hours every night, he was still young. Sleeping eight hours was not too much. Therefore, he did more work and felt that he was not getting enough sleep and had no time to rest and play. A person is like a machine, running day and night, and the machine will feel tired. Moreover, Liu Xing Shu's body was not very healthy to begin with. Therefore, he gradually developed symptoms of illness. One day, he said to Zuo Shi Chen, "You say that a person needs to sleep an average of eight hours every night, but now I can't believe your words more and more. For example, if I translate more books at night and go to sleep at three o'clock, sometimes I can't fall asleep when I get into bed. Occasionally, I doze off, but when it gets light, I always wake up. Or if I go to bed an hour earlier, I wake up in the middle of the night and look at the sky with wide eyes, feeling very uncomfortable. According to this calculation, I never get eight hours of sleep every day." In fact, he had already contracted insomnia. Because he liked to think hard and change his mind. Whenever a person can't fall asleep, they start to think randomly. The more they want to sleep, the less they can sleep. The more they can't sleep, the more they think. Because they do too much work and are too busy, they get all fired up. So at night, their faces often turn red, and their cheeks are slightly red. They also gradually cough. One day, Zuo Shi Chen went to see him at his Ming Bao newspaper office. The Ming Bao newspaper office was in a room in the Ming Zhong Club. Their editorial department was just one big room, where everyone worked. Zuo Shi Chen often went to their editorial department. He knew several reporters. Zuo Shi Chen sat at Liu Yin Shu's desk. He was translating Western newspapers while talking to Zuo Shi Chen. But he heard his newly started cough. In one minute, he would cough two or three times, or even four or five times. Zuo Shi Chen felt that this cough did not sound good.</p>

<p>Gold Market: Latent Signs of Weakness</p>
<h3>Reaction After Three Days of Continuous Rise</h3>
<p>Changeable and without any standard, yesterday's gold market conditions remained confusing and erratic, with drastic fluctuations that made people feel frenzied, drunk, and foolish, unable to grasp anything. Prices still rose and fell by several taels at a time. However, a downward trend was lurking. The morning market saw a difference of more than seven taels, while the afternoon market was relatively stable, fluctuating by only one and a half taels. The foreign exchange market remained stable. Trading among dealers was not active. Companies like Wanxing, Yu Tai, Fuxing Yong, and Yuanmao Yong were mostly selling, while Fuchang, Yuancheng Yong, and Hengxing were entering and exiting intermittently. Since the morning market was filled with rumors that a silver tax was about to be implemented, causing fear among the general public, a storm arose, and the market opened low. Soon after, it rose sharply, fluctuating by more than four taels. Subsequently, Yu Tai, Fuxing Yong, and others sold aggressively, causing a sharp drop of six or seven taels from over 521 taels to 514 taels. In an instant, all parties seized the opportunity to purchase, resulting in a surge of five or six taels, followed by a slight correction of two or three taels. The market was in an indescribable state of chaos. Later, Wanxing, Shunli, Hengxing, and others sold slightly, and there were very few buyers. However, the market sentiment was uncertain, with fluctuations of just over one tael. The foreign exchange market was inactive.</p>
<p>The market opened with a decline, fluctuating by more than seven taels. The price of British silver rebounded by one-sixteenth, while the price of American silver still fell by three-eighths. The price of gold for July opened at 518 taels and 5 qian, immediately falling by 2 taels and 4 qian. Gross margins fluctuated by more than four taels. Initially, it was 17 taels, then it reached 21 taels and a half. When the first order was announced, it was 18 taels and a half, and the listed price remained unchanged. However, for July, the British gold wheat traders bought at 9 pence and 9375. For June, banks traded among themselves at 9 pence and 875. Subsequently, retail investors bought, pushing the price as high as 20 taels and 02 qian. Then, large investors sold off, and with British gold firming, the wheat trading company bought July at 10 pence and 125, causing a sharp drop of 6 taels to 10.0, to 14 taels. Suddenly, due to hedging by various firms and short sellers entering the market, and with various exchange rates firming, there was a jump of over five or six taels. After 11 o'clock, it was 20 taels. However, sellers remained persistent, and the price has now fallen back by 3 taels. At noon, the closing price was 17 taels and 7 qian.</p>
<p>The afternoon market was slightly calmer, resulting in a small drop of 2 taels and 4 qian. The afternoon market opened at 18 taels, then rose from 17 taels and 5 qian to 18 taels and 8 qian. In an instant, it fell back to 17 taels and 3 qian. After 2:30, there were fluctuations of one tael. Subsequently, due to more buyers, it rebounded to 18 taels and 8 qian. After 3:30, it turned downward again, falling slightly by one tael. At 4 o'clock, it was 17 taels and a half, truly a situation where selling led to a slight decline. However, various exchange rates happened to be inactive on Wednesday. Finally, some retail short sellers covered their positions, so the closing price at 4:30 was 518 taels and a half, a drop of more than 2 taels compared to the previous day, a reversal after three days of consecutive gains.</p>
<p>The daily exchange rate announcement was down 23 taels. The highest price of the day was 21 taels and 5 qian, and the lowest price was 14 taels, a difference of 7 taels and 5 qian. The announced price was still 541 taels and 8 qian, a decrease of 23 or 24 taels. The afternoon price was still suppressed at over 23 taels for accounting purposes, with a premium of 18 taels in the morning and 19 taels in the afternoon. Goods opened at 19 taels in the morning and closed at 18 taels in the afternoon, with the afternoon closing price at 17 taels and a half and 19 taels.</p>
<p>Various firms had uncertain trading activity. Dadecheng, Yuanyu Yong, Taifengcheng, Chunyuan Yong, and Senchang Yong were all buying. Fuchang, Yuanxing Yong, and Yuancheng Yong were buying and selling intermittently. Shunli, Wanxing, and Yuanmao Yong sold more than they bought. Yuancheng, Yu Dai, Fuxing Yong, Hengxing, and Yu Tai all sold. In the afternoon, Kunhe, Wanxing, Shunli, and Hengxing all sold, while Yuanyu Yong, Zhenchangxiang, Yuancheng Yong, and retail investors all bought. The Dalian group sold a total of about 1,700 or 1,800 bars, while buying about 700 bars. The Guangdong group sold over 1,000 bars, it was said.</p>
<h3>Daily Exchange Rate: There are Prices, but No Market</h3>
<p>British and American slightly up... Listed prices unchanged.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of yellow silver rose slightly, while the price of American silver remained low. The market was extremely quiet. Yokohama and Kobe remained in a dormant state. Except for Hong Kong, which added 75, totaling 80 taels and 075, HSBC's listed foreign exchange rates were unchanged. However, the domestic prices of British and American currencies initially eased, then firmed, and then trended downward again. There was no substantial trading in Japanese gold, so the price remained tight, but the bid and ask prices were far apart. Chinese merchants were generally waiting and watching. By the time the market closed at noon, the spot price was slightly up by 0.0625, the price of American gold was up by 125, and the price of Japanese gold was up by half a point. It was as if there were prices but no market. As for the gold market, the turbulence remained treacherous, changing rapidly and unpredictably, truly a result of the silver tax issue. The result was a lurking downward trend. It was estimated that over 100,000 pounds of British gold were traded, with Chinese merchants selling about six-tenths of it. Banks such as the Wheat Trading Company, Mitsui, and the Industrial and Commercial Bank took it in. In addition, the China-Japan Bank did tens of thousands of pounds in trades. Mitsui sold slightly, while there was little trading in American gold. As for Japanese gold, only the Dalian group sold to Mitsui, with Dalian having several hundred thousand yuan. In the afternoon, due to it being Wednesday, the market was inactive.</p>
<p>The British exchange rate fluctuated by about 1875 in half a day. In the morning, the asking price for May was 1 shilling and 9 pence and 875, with June, July, and August each increasing by 0.0625. The buying price also increased by 0.0625. At noon, the asking price for May was 9 pence and 8125, the buying price was 875, the asking price for August was 10 pence, and the buying price was 10 pence and 0625.</p>
<p>The domestic price of the American exchange rate fluctuated by about 375. Trading was slow. In the morning, the asking price for May was 44 yuan and 25, the buying price was 375, and June, July, and August each increased by 125. At noon, the asking price for May was 44 yuan and 1875, the buying price was 2125, the asking price for August was 5625, and the buying price was 6875.</p>
<p>The domestic price of the Eastern exchange rate fluctuated by about 1 point, but trading was sluggish. From the early morning, the asking price for May was about 1 tael, 1 qian, and 1 point, the buying price was 1 qian and 05. The asking price for June was 1 qian and 0625, the buying price was 125.

At noon, the asking price for May was 1 tael and 1 qian and 1 point, June was 1 point 125, July was 075, and August was 05. The buying prices were each reduced by 05, and the difference between near and far term was 375. The banks' buying prices were actually more than half a point apart, and the market conditions were chaotic and disorderly, it was said.</p>
<h3>Silver Prices: British Up, American Down</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's London telegraph, the price of silver rebounded slightly. The recent price increased by 0.0625 to 18 pence and 8125 (equivalent to 1 shilling and 10 pence and 25 in British gold), and the deferred price also increased by 0.0625 to 18 pence and 75. The spot price did not change much and was extremely sluggish. According to New York telegraph, the price of American silver was still in a downward trend, with the spot price falling by 375 to a new record of 4 jiao and 025. The exchange rate between the US and the UK did not change, remaining at 4 yuan and 8 jiao and 6 fen.

<h3>Demobilization Rose Sharply by More Than Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trading situation of various bonds in the Shanghai Securities Market was as follows: the futures market was booming, and trading was unusually active, but spot goods were very limited, except for demobilization, which had more activity. The overall situation was slightly better, and market sentiment was good. Investment buying increased sharply, and prices rose uniformly. The demand for demobilization was particularly strong, and futures rose sharply by 2 yuan and 34 jiao. Customs duties also rose by 1 yuan and 3 jiao, and whole six and troop reduction each rose by 7 or 8 jiao. Other bonds were very stable, with supply and demand relatively balanced, fluctuating by only a few jiao in both the morning and afternoon markets. The total turnover of spot goods for the whole day was 25,200 yuan, and the turnover of futures was over 11 million.</p>

<p>Yarn Prices: Spot Yarn Slightly Firm, Actual Sales Quiet Again</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending towards firmness. Rumors of an increase in factory exit tax are rampant, leading to firm sentiment. Market atmosphere is better. Retail investors are covering short positions, and long positions remain unmoved. Therefore, the situation is tightening. However, overseas conditions remain weak. Various groups lack long-term strength in current yarn sales. Yesterday's trading appeared quite active, but today it is quiet again. Based on the fundamentals, the yarn market still has no significant upside potential. Due to a shortage of 20-count Five Blessings and Shepherd in the warehouse, the atmosphere is temporarily good, and there may be a small recovery.</p>
<p>The price of yarn for spot delivery rose slightly as retail investors covered short positions. In the morning market, the opening price of futures yarn was stable because there was not much change in American cotton. Trading volume in each month was not high. Later, with positive news in the situation, the market atmosphere tightened again, and each month rose by 1, 2, 3, or 4 qian. In the afternoon, retail investors covered short positions, and large long positions refused to sell, so the available amount was small, and the market suddenly firmed, with each month rising by 2, 3, or 5 qian. The total turnover for the whole day was estimated at 5,750 bales. The closing prices for spot yarn are recorded below.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Closing Prices Change from Previous Day Open Interest August 153.5 Up 6 21,400</p>
<p>May 152.7 Up 6 29,000 September 154.2 612,450</p>
<p>June 152.8 630,700 October 154.4 20,250</p>
<p>July 152.9 626,050</p>
<p>The opening volume of spot yarn was 1,400 bales, and the sales of weak spot yarn were relatively average. Various groups bought an estimated 880 bales, and dealers bought 500 bales. The price of Japanese yarn was stable and weak. Among the customers, the Sichuan group bought the most, estimated at 230 bales. In addition, Xiamen bought 175 bales, Shantou bought 25 bales, the inland bought 120 bales, Wuhu bought 20 bales, Niuzhuang bought 55 bales, Qingdao bought 115 bales, Changsha bought 50 bales, Hankou bought 20 bales, and other groups bought 70 bales, it was said.</p>
<h3>North China Cotton Yarn Exports Increase Sharply in April</h3>
<p>Shanghai cotton yarn exports in April totaled 80,483 bales, an increase of 36,061 bales compared to February, the highest number this year. This is due to the demand situation, hence this increase. Among them, North China exports were the most numerous. The list is as follows (unit: bales):</p>
<p>April Increase Compared to March</p>
<p>North China 30,660 17,104</p>
<p>Yangtze River 28,248 7,940</p>
<p>South China 19,192 10,017</p>
<p>Foreign Countries 2,383 1,000</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market Remains Difficult to Revitalize</h3>
<p>The overall cotton market is calm, and there is unlikely to be any major change at present. American cotton is also fluctuating within a range. Judging from the situation, there is unlikely to be any major contraction or expansion in the short term. However, consumption has decreased compared to last year. General holders of goods are more inclined to buy and hold tight, as they believe that spot goods in Shanghai are weak, Hankou prices are high, and sources are scarce. Most factories have also absorbed a lot of Indian cotton and are not worried. Therefore, sales of spot cotton are completely cut off, and the use of fire engine cotton is increasingly lacking. The future of the cotton market still has no major development.</p>
<p>Hengda, a long position holder, sold 2,000 bales of Hankou cotton. In the morning market, the opening price was flat, and American cotton rose slightly. The market was relatively relaxed, with each month falling by 5 fen. In the afternoon, retail investors covered short positions, rising by 5 fen to 1 qian. However, Hengda still sold 2,000 dan in the current month, and the market was relatively weak. The total turnover for the whole day was estimated at 23,800 dan. The closing prices for Hankou cotton are recorded below.</p>
<p>Hankou Cotton Closing Prices Change from Previous Day Open Interest July 35.45 Up 5 62,300</p>

<p>June 35.20 Up 5 69,400 October 34.75 Down 5 52,300</p>
<p>Actual demand is difficult to develop. Spot cotton trading is flat. The source is estimated to be 100 bales of Tong cotton and 250 bales of Yao cotton. The sales records are below.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 37.75 Hongzhang Factory bought 200 pieces, spot delivery to the factory</p>
<p>Also 37.00 Puyi Factory bought 80 pieces, also also</p>
<p>Nanshi Cotton 34.50 Also 200 pieces, also also</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 21.25 Dong Cotton Company bought 125 pieces, also delivered at the warehouse</p>
<h3>Overseas Cotton and Yarn Prices Rise More Than Fall</h3>
<p>American Cotton: Dealers Buying in Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to good weather, but later firmed due to dealers buying in and short covering. Futures rose by 5 to 12 points, and spot goods rose by 10 points. British cotton futures fell by 15 to 18 points, and spot goods fell by 11 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by 5 taels. Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegraph is recorded below (Telegraph on the 20th):</p>

<p>Raw Silk Mills: New Goods Still Difficult to Sell</p>
<p>Although the Shanghai raw silk mill's telegraphs for new shipments to overseas markets were received yesterday morning, overseas raw silk inventories were relatively full, Japanese raw silk prices were cheap, and exchange rates were relatively long. The incoming prices were still low, and Chinese merchants were unwilling to sell at a loss. Yesterday, only Yu Deng entered 30 bales of Chen raw silk, and Xinfu entered 15 bales of Bai Da raw silk. Prices remained flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Yili New Cocoons Have a Poor Harvest</h3>
<p>With only 40% of the normal yield, cocoon merchants open their scales sparsely.</p>
<p>Yixing and Liyang are both cocoon-producing areas. Recently, they have been affected by banditry, and silkworm farming has declined. This year, the atmosphere of banditry is still rampant, and farmers dare not raise many silkworm eggs. In addition, the climate is out of sync, with cold weather and heavy rain, causing great damage to silkworm ants. Currently, in both Yixing and Liyang, early silkworms have already spun their cocoons, and late silkworms are just starting to emerge. Those who ask about going to the silkworm frames are present. The other day, it rained all day, and from hot to cold, the silkworm moths changed again, and the sleep heads did not rise. This year, the cocoon production in the four rural areas is bound to be poor. The address is at most 40% of the normal years. The cocoon merchants in each village are afraid of banditry, and those who open their scales are as few as the agricultural stars. Only the urban areas and market towns near the city still have exchange coupons to open their scales. Statistics are less than two or three-tenths of past years, it is said.</p>
<h3>Cocoon Prices in Hangzhou Soar</h3>
<p>The prices of improved varieties of high-quality cocoons have already opened above 80 yuan.</p>
<p>Cocoon merchants in Linping, Tangxi Pingyao, Gongchen Bridge, Gengshanmen, and other places in Hangzhou have been opening their scales for over a week. The market arrival is quite prosperous. Each line actively competes to collect cocoons. Cocoon prices have risen from 55 or 56 yuan to 67 or 68 yuan. The other day, it was cloudy and rainy all day, and the arrival was sparse. Each cocoon line is afraid that this year's Zhejiang cocoon production will have to discount 20% off from last year. They are deeply afraid that raw materials will panic in the future, and they all hold a multi-collection principle and release prices to compete for collection. Yesterday, the sky cleared slightly from the rain, and the arrival still did not appear crowded. Cocoon prices soared. Improved varieties of high-quality goods prices have already risen to more than 80 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Qicha Opens to 220 Taels</h3>
<p>Since Qimen black tea was launched on the market on Sunday, the British tea houses have spared no effort in searching for goods with excellent leaf bottom production methods. However, the supply of this high-quality tea is in short supply, and the market price has already picked up to 220 taels, opening a new record unprecedented. However, the British houses' interest in Qining black teas from various medium and low-quality farms is still weak, because the London market has a large stock of Indian tea, which is difficult to compete with. As for the green tea market, the sales of native farm Zhenmei have completely stopped, and the products from Suian are also not considered to be a good image, it is said.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan Southwest Tea Begins to Open One After Another</h3>
<p>Wuyi New Tea: In recent days, various brands have been discussing prices. The brands in the northern villages of Huyuan Tea are unwilling to sell because the brand prices are suppressed. Yesterday, only Qiantan opened their scales, with a selling price of 66 yuan. Hongcun sold for 68 yuan, and Gaojian section offered 64 yuan. The rest are extremely few settled, so in recent days, the northern tea houses have been flocking to the southwest to purchase, because the tea production in the southwest villages this year is earlier than in the northeast, and the first garden to open produces tender and delicate tea, which is in great demand by the tea houses. Yesterday, the Jiadao in the western village opened its scales, with a selling price of 58 yuan, and Beitengkou and Mazha were sold for 60 yuan. The lake mountain was 62 yuan, Xia Yantian 56 yuan, Shang Yantian 60 yuan, Changlin 58 yuan. The areas around Zhongyun and Zhangmu in the southern villages also opened their scales, with a selling price of 60 yuan. The tea stored in the mountains in the southwest has been searched by various brands and sold to 60% of it. The northern village tea houses now have no one asking about them, and the market is strangely cold. Zhongyun Zhifeng Nanlu tea houses are now importing 100 to 200 dan of tea. Since the day before yesterday, they have all been opening their hands to rush to make it. Today (14th), the ticket price for Cheng and Siwukou has surged to 1,328 yuan due to the urgent need of various brands and insufficient sources. Those without current foreign money have suffered a discount from the ticket price, it is said. (14th)</p>
<h3>Food Grains: Rice Market Firm and Quiet Amidst Rainy Weather</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wharfs in Zhabei saw a slight arrival of sources, but the river hoppers were difficult to start due to the incessant rain, so the market was quiet. However, the northern japonica rice had a slight opening, and the factory and warehouse goods could still be sampled and evaluated. The situation felt slightly firm. The Jiangsu help Guan japonica was priced at 19.5 to 20 yuan, similar to the previous two markets. The thin rice sheep tips were stagnant. Although small trades were seen, it was still difficult to move the hoppers, so we will continue to wait and see. The prices of all goods for the whole day did not rise or fall. There were a few transactions in the morning, but they remained depressed and stopped due to the continuous rain.</p>
<p>Few ships arrived in South Shanghai, and market sales moved slightly. The seller raised the price slightly due to the rain in the north, but it was difficult to cross the hoppers in the rain in the port, so the buyer had a dull appetite and waited and watched. The high-quality goods were slightly tight by a few minutes, and there was no possibility of turning prosperous for the middle and low-quality goods. If the heavens continue to rain, the source will inevitably affect the price and will inevitably turn up, and the early indica rice and mutton tips in the southern roads are all strangely quiet due to the rain, so there is no lack of accurate targets. However, the flat rice is about to be sold, and the foreign rice is still weak, so the japonica rice market is afraid of becoming more calm. The white yuan inventory has a better outlet and prices are still downstream. The volume of transactions on the docks throughout the day was extremely small, due to the difficulty in measuring hoppers in the rain.</p>
<h3>Flour: Long Positions Sold, Afternoon Returns Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market presented a picture of first firmness, then weakness. At the initial opening of the morning, with the unceasing rain, people's hearts turned high, but in the subsequent sessions, many long positions, near and far term, issued from the outside. After the festival rise, the general inland help was in a state of glee, as if they had an unthinkable feeling, so they seized this opportunity and were unwilling to get involved again, selling at any time. Originally, the formation of this situation was caused by the squeeze, and the inland help's looting also gained a lot of assistance. Observing the subsequent steps, with the factory still in a non-relaxed state, too much relaxation will have to wait until the new wheat season. The result was that the current month was a little 5 li less than the previous day, June was a little 2.5 li, July and August did not move, September was a little 5 li, and October did not move, it was said.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market: Futures and Spot Did Not Rise or Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market largely presented a picture of circling. Foreign wheat was quoted at 457 jiao, but speculators could not help but have some concerns due to the cloudy and rainy weather. However, the harvest season of new wheat is still about two weeks away, so it is not yet urgent. However, the closer it is to the harvest season, the more it will be slightly affected. As a result, the June, July, and August months did not move, and the September and October months were slightly less one fen. Spot wheat trading was still scarce. The opening prices of each wharf were also seldom up or down. After this, the old wheat will reach its expiration, and the new goods can replace it, this kind of market can be difficult to be high again. The opening price for Xuzhou wheat, Bengbu wheat, and Shandong wheat was 5 taels, 1 qian, and 7 fen. The opening prices for Hankou wheat were 4 taels, 5 qian, and half and 4 taels, 4 qian, and 3 fen, for a total of 1,500 bales, it was said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Increased Again Due to Jiangxi Buying</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the prices of foreign rice were still weak in the morning after the market opened due to ample arrivals and storage. In the afternoon, Jiangxi help and Zhejiang road suddenly searched for buying in the street, and the situation immediately turned around. All rice rose 5 or 6 points, and small sizes became more sought-after. The total market transaction was 6,000 bags of small sizes, priced at 14 yuan, 3 jiao, and half, and 2,000 bags of brown rice, priced at 13 yuan, 1 jiao, and 3 fen. 3,000 bags of large sizes, priced at 14 yuan and 1 jiao. 500 bags of No. 1 Saigon, priced at 15 yuan and 1 jiao, and 300 bags of No. 2, priced at 14 yuan and 4 jiao, it was said.</p>
<p>Seafood: The first season shrimp roe from Jiangbei arrived yesterday, with three loads.</p>
<p>Selling price: 180 to 195 taels</p>
<p>Shrimp and crab and fish, the old goods have long been out of stock. The new goods were harvested poorly due to the wrong season. Yesterday, the first season of shrimp roe from Jiangbei arrived, with 300 hundred jin, and was sold for 180 to 195 taels. The goods were wet, and the color was withered and black. As it was the first batch, key buyers were still stylish, and it was sold to the street and the Han help. It is said that the second batch of goods can also be delivered in a few days, and subsequent market prices are protected against turning down.

<p>Hardware: Galvanized Iron: Galvanized Iron Tiles are Flourishing</p>
<p>Recently, galvanized iron, whether British or American goods, has shown a flourishing trend. Since the recent sharp contraction of foreign exchange, the cost of all goods has increased sharply, especially Japanese goods. The price of Japanese goods is more than 10% higher than in Shanghai, so the industry has not placed any orders. At present, the estimated price of British goods is 11 taels, 2 qian, and half per load for 24 gauge, 12 taels for 26 gauge, 12 taels and 7 qian and half for 28 gauge, and 13 taels and 8 qian and half for 31 gauge. For American goods, the estimated price is 12 taels and 2 qian and half for 24 gauge, 13 taels and 7 qian and half for 26 gauge, 14 taels and 7 qian and half for 28 gauge, and 14 taels for 48 gauge. Transactions with the Yangtze River and Fujian and Zhejiang groups are smoother, while business on the northern roads seems deserted, it was said.</p>
<p>Galvanized iron tiles: With the yellow plum season approaching, the northern roads have increased their purchases, so the market goods have been almost exhausted. The flow of standard goods is very scarce, resulting in a shortage of supply. Market prices are extraordinarily high, such as an estimated 10 taels and 5</p>
<h3>National General Chamber of Commerce Appeals</h3>
<p>Stop Throwing Bombs at Merchants and Civilians</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, the Red Cross Society, the Disaster Relief Committee, and the Shanghai Office, etc., recently received a telegram from the Henan Relief Committee, the Henan Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, and the Red Cross Branch, which read: "Our Henan people have suffered from natural disasters and banditry for years, and the people are living in misery, in dire straits. Recently, wars have broken out in Henan Province, and planes from various routes in the southeast have arrived one after another, throwing bombs. Areas such as Guide, Lanfeng, and Kaifeng in the east, as well as the area south of Zhengzhou, have suffered countless deaths and destruction of civilian houses. Whenever planes arrive, the old and young, men and women, are unable to defend themselves, and the cries shake the earth. The tragic situation is unbearable to witness. We believe that the authorities, as advanced members of the Party and the country, and with compassion for the people, will surely be moved by such a tragic disaster. Moreover, places like Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and Lanfeng are not war zones. It is even more pitiful that our innocent people are made such meaningless sacrifices. Our association has received urgent requests from the people and has already telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Chiang and the Commanders-in-Chief of Xuzhou and Hankou to stop this, but we have not received a response. The people are even more frightened, so we telegraphed your esteemed association again, asking you to convey public opinion and request Commander-in-Chief Chiang to instruct the front lines to refrain from sending planes to Henan to throw bombs, in order to reassure the people and protect the lives of all. We will be eternally grateful. We also hope for a telegraphic reply. Respectfully, the Henan Relief Committee, the Henan Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, and the Red Cross Branch." After receiving the telegram, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce telegraphed Chairman Chiang yesterday, saying, "Respectfully presented to Commander-in-Chief Chiang of Xuzhou. We have received a telegram from the Henan Relief Committee, the Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Relief Association, and the Red Cross Society, begging that planes refrain from throwing bombs at merchants and civilians in Henan Province. We are forwarding this telegram on their behalf. We hope that you will instruct all routes to comply. Respectfully, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce."</p>

<h3>Suppressing</h3>
<p>Usurious Interest Rates in Concession Pawnshops</p>
<p>Propose Amending the Regulations on Pawnshop Licenses of the Public Works Department</p>
<p>The usurious exploitation of pawnshops in the concessions of this city has been a long-standing practice. Some charge interest as high as eight or nine percent per month, and six percent per month is considered normal, which is related to the livelihood of the common people. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has now decided to suppress it according to law. The letter is recorded as follows: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau sent a letter to the Five Chinese Directors yesterday, saying: "With regard to the case of the business rules for the pawnshop industry in this city, previously approved by the Shanghai Merchant Group Rectification Committee, which forwarded the request from the Commercial Pawnshop Association to amend the business rules for pawnshops in this city, the pawnshop business rules were revised and submitted to the National Government for approval and record, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government was ordered to instruct the former Shanghai Provisional Court to comply with the rules. The suppression of usurious exploitation is a matter of national government orders and should be strictly followed to relieve the people's difficulties. Now, all pawnshops in the Chinese territory of this city have been registered and are charging interest in accordance with the regulations. However, pawnshops in the concessions still rely on foreign forces for protection and have refused to comply. If they are not strictly suppressed, the poor people in the concessions will feel the pain, and the disparity between the Chinese and concession areas will damage national prestige. In addition to sending a separate letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession, we also request you to propose amending the Regulations on Pawnshop Licenses of the Public Works Department at the next meeting of the board of directors, so that all pawnshops must comply with the revised pawnshop business rules of this city approved by the National Government, reduce interest rates, and determine compensation, in order to benefit the poor and value government orders. This is our sincere hope."</p>
<p>The Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Department and the Five Chinese Directors, saying: "With regard to the case approved by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau in Official Letter No. 3824, regarding the Pawnshop Business Rules of this city, which were previously sent to your association for reference, and requested that you urge the pawnshop industry in the concession to comply with them. This year, after considering commercial conditions and accommodating the opinions of the industry, slight revisions were made and submitted to the Executive Yuan of the National Government for record, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government was ordered to instruct the former Shanghai Provisional Court to comply with the rules. The suppression of usurious exploitation is a matter of national government orders and should be strictly followed to relieve the people's difficulties. Now, all pawnshops in the Chinese territory of this city have been registered within the deadline and are charging interest in accordance with the regulations. Pawnshops in the concession should not be treated differently. Therefore, we are sending another letter to your association for reference and requesting that you immediately inform the Public Works Department of the Public Concession and instruct all pawnshops in the concession to comply with the regulations strictly. We also ask you to consult with the Chinese directors to propose amending the Regulations on Pawnshop Licenses of the Public Works Department at the next meeting of the Public Works Department, and to clearly stipulate that interest should be charged in accordance with the revised pawnshop business rules of this city to benefit the poor. This is our public concern. In addition to replying to the letter and sending separate letters, we are forwarding this letter to you and hope that you will take it into consideration and implement it, and please inform us of the progress." Addressed to Mr. Edward, Director-General of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, and Directors Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Xinliu, Bei Songsun, and Liu Hongsheng.</p>

<h3>Silk Cocoon Guild Requests Protection for Cocoon Trading</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Silk Filature Association and the Joint Silk Cocoon Guild of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, noting that the location outside Yaohua Gate in Nanjing is relatively remote, and that the newly opened Minfeng Cocoon Trading Company is about to commence trading, are deeply concerned about potential disturbances by local ruffians. They have recently sent separate telegrams to the Jiangning County Government, requesting special protection. The original telegram stated: "To the esteemed Jiangning County Government, regarding the proposal by Standing Committee Member Zhu Jing'an that to improve the silk industry and promote foreign trade, the Minfeng Model Silk Filature was established in Wuxi, and over one hundred mu of land was purchased in Yaohua Gate, Nanjing, to establish the Minfeng Seed Production Farm and the Minfeng Cocoon Trading Company, in order to improve seed production and facilitate cocoon sales for cocoon farmers. The County Government has already issued a license. However, as the market is about to open for cocoon collection, we are deeply concerned that local thugs may cause trouble. We respectfully request the Jiangning County Government to issue a proclamation and dispatch officers to provide protection. As the Minfeng Cocoon Trading Company is scheduled to open within one or two days, the matter concerns the protection of agriculture and commerce, and prevention is essential. Therefore, we respectfully request your approval to dispatch officers or guards to protect the Minfeng Cocoon Trading Company and issue a proclamation strictly prohibiting disturbances. We would be immensely grateful. Respectfully, Shen Huachen, Chairman of the Shanghai Special Municipality Silk Filature Association, and Huang Jin, Chairman of the Joint Silk Cocoon Guild."</p>

<p>This year's Zhejiang spring cocoons transported via the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway have been loaded and transported by the Huitong Transport Company since the 12th of this month. Approximately 5,000 packages have been successively reported for shipment from the Gongchen and Chang'an stations and transported to the Shanghai South Station. Over 100 packages have also arrived at the North Station. It is reported that about 15,000 to 16,000 packages are stored in warehouses at Gongchen, Chang'an, Linping, Xucun, and other stations, awaiting transport to Shanghai. However, the Railway Bureau lacks locomotives, so extra cars are added to the Hangzhou-bound freight trains for transport. Once locomotives are available, special trains will be added to transport the cocoons to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>County Finance Bureau Urges Payment of Brokerage Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Finance Bureau has found that there are still substantial arrears in brokerage tax since it was levied. Now is the cocoon season, so it is urgent to step up collection. Therefore, it ordered the brokerage official Xing Fengxiang yesterday to quickly collect payments in various locations, aiming to complete the process by June.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Commodity Inspection Bureau Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau held its 30th Bureau Affairs Meeting at 12:00 noon the day before yesterday in the Raw Silk Inspection Office. Attendees included Bureau Chief Zou, Deputy Bureau Chief Fei, and Li Songxia, Ye Yuanding, Huang Zongxun, Chen Shungeng, Zhang Weiru, Luo Qingsheng, Chen Jinduan, Tao Yumen, Qiu Qiwen, and others. Liu Jianxiong recorded the minutes. Bureau Chief Zou chaired the meeting. The meeting commenced with a report by the chairman that personnel from the preparatory office of the Guangdong Commodity Inspection Bureau had visited the bureau to observe operations and reported on their preparation plans. First, the proposal on how to prepare for welcoming Minister Kong's visit to Shanghai on the 23rd to give instructions to the bureau was discussed. It was decided to hold a welcoming meeting first and report on the progress of inspection and research work, and then invite the Minister to give instructions. Next, the proposal on slightly changing the progress of the lace inspection office was discussed and a decision was requested. It was decided to inspect in stages, starting with the "Feili" lace as a trial to reduce the scope of work and increase work efficiency, making the results easier to perfect. More attention should be paid to research and improvement work. After the "Feili" lace inspection has achieved results, proceed with the original plan in order. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Ministry Approves</h3>
<p>Exemption of Inspection for Domestic Goods</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Commodity Inspection Conference previously resolved to divide the methods for inspecting goods that should be inspected into two categories: (1) Those that should be thoroughly inspected: these items, regardless of whether they are exported abroad, imported from abroad, or sold in collection and distribution markets, must be inspected uniformly. (2) Those that should be temporarily partially inspected: these items are only inspected for export, and are not inspected when transported from one port to another or sold in collection and distribution markets, except when merchants request and the Ministry specifically approves. The Ministry designated tung oil and cotton as items for thorough inspection, and livestock products and by-products, raw silk, tea, and beans as items for partial inspection, and instructed the local commodity inspection bureaus to record them. The Ministry now considers that merchants transporting pig intestines from Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places to Shanghai still need to be inspected, which would require paying fees for inspection in Shanghai, and the procedures are cumbersome, increasing the burden. This has caused some complaints. According to the resolutions of the Commodity Inspection Conference and the Ministry's orders, this is not in compliance. Therefore, the Ministry issued another order to all bureaus that casings are one of the by-products of livestock, and should be exempted from inspection when transported from one domestic port to another. It is now stipulated that, starting from today, all goods that should be partially inspected shall only be inspected for direct export abroad, unless merchants request and the Ministry specifically approves. They are exempted from inspection when transported from one port to another or sold in collection and distribution markets.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, the Collection of Foreign Property Tax in Zhabei</h3>
<p>The case of foreign residents in Zhabei paying property tax has been properly negotiated by the North Municipal Tax Collection Office. The Special Municipal Finance Bureau officially issued an order yesterday to assign personnel to collect summer property tax, which is 10% for residential properties and 10% for shops. Detailed rules will be specified separately.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Japanese Director Scheduled to Return Home</h3>
<p>June 1st</p>
<p>Saito Takeo, the Japanese Director of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, has formally submitted his resignation to the department due to his transfer to England. It has been decided that Okamoto Otsuichi, an assistant lawyer at the Murakami Law Office, will succeed him as Japanese Director. It was learned yesterday that Saito has properly completed his public and private affairs in recent days and is scheduled to take the Chichibu Maru on June 1st to return to Japan first, and then transfer to the United States and England to take up his new position. Honge Sadame, the new head of the postal shipping company, will come to Shanghai at the end of this month to take up his new position. The new Japanese Director, Okamoto, is also scheduled to take office in Shanghai at the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Opium Cases Must Be Handled by the Courts</h3>
<p>No Agency May Destroy Them on Its Own</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications Instructed the Postal Administration to Comply Yesterday</p>
<p>The General Post Office of this port received instructions from the Ministry of Communications yesterday, stating: "Regarding the handling of matters, it was found that the Anti-Opium Committee had previously consulted, as instructed by the Executive Yuan and approved by the National Government, on the disposal of a large quantity of heroin seized at the post office, proposed by the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee Designated Committee. Item 3 should be changed to transferring the case to the court for execution of destruction. We hereby consult you to instruct the General Post Office to comply. The Ministry then forwarded the original letter, copied and recorded, with a three-item handling method approved by the Standing Committee, as the method for changing the handling of prohibited items. After receiving a reply, it was stated that since the drugs had already been destroyed, the case was closed. In addition to reporting the handling situation to the Executive Yuan, the committee will also submit another document requesting a general order that all agencies must transfer opium and narcotics seized in the future to the court for handling according to the law, and may not destroy them on their own." The circular instructed the General Post Office to investigate and comply.</p>
<h3>Nanyang Workers Appeal for Factory Reopening</h3>
<p>Requesting the Municipal Party Committee to Order the Factory to Resume Operations Immediately</p>
<p>The Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company in this city previously announced its closure due to high gold prices, leaving thousands of workers unemployed. After investigation by the Municipal Party Committee in conjunction with the Social Affairs Bureau, it was determined that the factory had no reason to close. Therefore, four measures were decided: (1) The factory must submit its factory regulations, employment contracts, and reopening plan to the bureau for review by the end of April. (2) The factory must reopen by May 16. (3) Long-term workers who are laid off by the employer after reopening, if they have served for more than two years, must be compensated with two months' severance pay. (4) If the factory does not reopen by May 16, the factory must pay one-third of the workers' wages as a maintenance fee for the extended period. However, the factory refused to accept this ruling and appealed to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce then consulted the municipal government, stating that the above measures were inappropriate. Now, the workers have submitted a petition to the Municipal Party Committee, requesting that it maintain the original text, as follows: "Petition: Requesting that you forward to the Municipal Government and then to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and not allow the Nanyang employer to make a one-sided request and disregard the plight of thousands of workers. The Nanyang employer has illegally closed the factory for several months, and the workers are suffering from hunger and cold. We have repeatedly requested your association and the Social Affairs Bureau to find ways to provide relief. We were then instructed to recognize that the factory's closure was a temporary suspension, not a permanent closure, and to give the company two months to reorganize and resume operations. All severance payments to workers should be considered as living expenses. Under the order of your association, we advised the workers to wait quietly for a resolution. Unexpectedly, the employer used the concession as a shield, deliberately disobeying orders and delaying the reopening of the factory. Last month, the Social Affairs Bureau instructed the factory to reopen before May 16. If it is necessary to reduce the scope of operations and lay off employees, severance pay should be paid to the workers in accordance with the law. If the factory does not reopen by then, one-third of the workers' maintenance fees should continue to be paid. Our association is in a difficult and arduous situation. Fortunately, we have received the protection of our superiors, and we are extremely grateful. Unexpectedly, the employer disregarded government orders and was insincere, submitting a report to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, overturning all the methods that your association and the Social Affairs Bureau had painstakingly maintained for the workers, and considering the third party to be unreasonably interfering, attempting to erase the facts and put the lives of thousands of our workers in a desperate situation. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce also relied solely on the employer's one-sided remarks, and hastily sent a letter to the municipal government overturning the Social Affairs Bureau's solution, which is deeply regrettable. Upon investigation, the employer's report to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce stated that it had paid the workers two months' severance pay, with the signature of the labor representative as proof, which may have legal effect. However, it is not known that the labor representative is an unscrupulous worker bribed by the employer, and a member of an illegal labor-management cooperation committee, which has long been rejected by the overall situation of the workers. Moreover, what was received was clearly a maintenance fee, not severance pay, but the employer actually used it as a basis, and regarded your association and the Social Affairs Bureau as an unreasonable interference by a third party. The act of deceiving superiors and misleading subordinates is extremely hateful. Our association has struggled for several months and finally achieved a glimmer of a solution, which was almost completely overturned by the employer. All the workers are extremely shocked. Now, as we are about to die, we can only make a final appeal, begging your association to understand the pain of the workers, uphold the laws of the party and the country, and, based on the facts, forward this to the municipal government, and not be blinded by the employer's one-sided reasons, which would lead to the livelihood of thousands of workers being in a desperate situation. We also hope that the employer will be ordered to open the factory immediately, so as to maintain the dying lives of the workers. We will repay your great kindness with a ring and grass. Weeping and expressing our words, we cannot help but wait for your orders. Sincerely submitted,"</p>
<h3>New Kang Family Association Notifies All Family Members</h3>
<p>Regarding Delaying Litigation</p>
<p>The New Kang Ship Disaster Family Association of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company notified all family members yesterday regarding the issue of delaying the lawsuit: "(Above omitted) Since the establishment of our association, it has been nearly a year. Our colleagues are entrusted by all family members and bear this important mission. Therefore, in the past year, we have been running around and appealing, never daring to slacken. Although we have suffered losses in terms of economy, spirit, and time, we have never dared to complain or complain, but due to various reasons, there is still no effective solution. The dead are full of grievances, and the living are displaced, which is regrettable. Now, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has filed a lawsuit in the Special Zone Court in accordance with the Ministry's order. Our association has also long hired Dr. Sheng Zhenwei as a legal consultant to handle all litigation matters for our association. All kinds of forms, books, and all evidence have been submitted to Lawyer Sheng for review, and the complaint has been drafted by Lawyer Sheng. The procedures are all ready, but the litigation expenses are still not settled, which has delayed the process. The family members have repeatedly questioned us, which is understandable. Our association has already commissioned the three standing committee members, Zhu, Zhu, and Zhou, to raise funds within a limited time so that we can file the lawsuit as soon as possible. We are afraid that the family members are worried, so we are writing again to inform you. (Below omitted)"</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Orders China Merchants Bureau to Pay</h3>
<p>Retirement Pensions for British Crew Members</p>
<p>The General Bureau of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in this port received instructions from the Ministry of Communications yesterday, stating: "Regarding the handling of matters, it was found that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs consulted, stating that regarding the case of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company owing allowances and retirement pensions to retired British crew members, the British envoy to China again stated, 'I have received a letter dated March 15 stating that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will try to find a way to pay the retirement pensions to retired crew members when the company's difficulties are slightly eased. However, according to reports, the company has recently spent a large amount of money to build new ships and new houses, but has been delaying the payment of retirement pensions to retired crew members. This is very harmful to credit. Because there is no retirement pension to help them, the retired crew members are experiencing economic difficulties and even suffering. I must declare to your minister that this kind of untrustworthy thing has been reported to my government, and ask you to forward it to the Ministry of Communications to order the bureau to pay it as soon as possible and not delay it any longer.'" The Ministry stated, "The General Bureau has been repeatedly urged by the British envoy to pay the retirement pensions owed to British crew members. The matter concerns foreign credit and should be resolved quickly. In addition to replying to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we hereby order the General Bureau to comply and reply immediately."</p>
<h3>National Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Requests Clemency for Yu Yaoxi's Unjust Imprisonment</p>
<p>The National Chamber of Commerce Federation yesterday submitted a document to the Judicial Yuan of the National Government, stating that Yu Yaoxi had no counter-revolutionary acts and requesting that the Supreme Court declare him innocent in accordance with the law. The reasons stated were roughly that Yu Yaoxi, the former president of the Jinan Commercial Port Chamber of Commerce, was detained on suspicion of counter-revolutionary crimes. The Higher Court of the province prosecuted him and sentenced him to ten years of imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for life. Recently, merchants from various ports came to the association, stating that when Zhang Zongchang occupied Shandong, Yu Yaoxi served as the president of the chamber of commerce. He had no choice but to be cordial with the warlords in order to protect himself and take care of the interests of the business community. This kind of hardship was shared by all merchants who had been under warlords. However, the Shandong Higher Court did not have any other conclusive evidence of Yu Yaoxi's crimes, and instead used his daily interactions and notices with Zhang Zongchang, and his maintenance of Shandong banknotes as evidence of rebellion, and punished him with a long-term prison sentence under the law for punishing counter-revolutionaries. If this case becomes final, all chambers of commerce that had been under warlords will not be spared. They asked the association to uphold justice and appeal on their behalf so that they can be vindicated. The association explained each point, hoping that the authorities would forgive him. Finally, they stated that Yu Yaoxi was a Christian and a staff member of the Jinan YMCA. He had been engaged in business for decades and never interfered in politics. He was usually enthusiastic about social undertakings and led the business community to compete with foreigners, so he was respected by the Shandong business community. Since his arrest and imprisonment last July, nearly a year has passed. His business has been abandoned, and the business community has lost its mentor and is extremely confused. Therefore, we hereby submit the actual situation, asking your court to quickly order the Supreme Court to expedite the declaration of innocence in accordance with the law. If the court adopts our appeal and clearly understands that the original judgment applied the wrong law, but still returns the case to the original trial in accordance with ordinary procedures, then the transfers back and forth will inevitably cause Yu Yaoxi to be imprisoned for several years, which would be a wrongful detention and would violate the government's original intention of loving the people and the court's duty to deliver justice. We still ask that this intention be communicated to the Higher Court. We are in fear and trembling, and we cannot help but to be loyal subjects."</p>

<h3>Dark Side of the "Board and Lodging" Labor System</h3>
<p>Pitiable Women from Jiangbei</p>
<p>Tens of Thousands of Women Come to Shanghai to Work</p>
<p>Employers Pocket Their Wages by Providing Room and Board</p>
<p>Reselling and Selling Them Off is Commonplace</p>
<p>The Ren Huaxiang Case is Just One Example</p>
<p>In recent years, due to repeated famines and widespread disasters in Funing, Yancheng, Xinghua, Lianshui, Gaoyou, and other counties in Jiangbei, the people everywhere are very impoverished, and those with large families barely get enough to eat. As a result, the Jiangbei people who live in Shanghai have taken advantage of this famine to raise funds, either by inviting friends to form associations, or by borrowing money at high interest rates, and then go back to their hometowns to recruit young women. Each woman is given 30 yuan (called a settlement allowance), and it is agreed that they will be brought to Shanghai to work for a term of three years. During this period, in addition to providing food and accommodation, all wages earned are taken by the employer. When the villagers there are worried about lack of food, they are happy to receive this 30 yuan. Therefore, in the past two years, the so-called "boarding and lodging" owners in the western part of Shanghai have recruited tens of thousands of women from their hometowns to Shanghai. Once these women arrive in Shanghai, they are placed in cotton mills by the employers to work. They eat two meals a day to barely fill their stomachs. The minimum monthly wage is 13 or 14 yuan, so after deducting the cost of food, there is a surplus of 7 or 8 yuan. Each owner has dozens of women under their care, or at least a dozen, and there are many people who have become wealthy because of these women. However, there is a dark side to it, which is infuriating. Since the owners treat these women like cattle and horses to make profits, they abuse them like pimps treat prostitutes. They have to work every day without stopping. They are not allowed to go out and play other than going to the factory to work. Some even resell or sell the women off without a trace, or take the opportunity to extort money. Their lawlessness is extreme. Yesterday, Wu Chungen, a 42-year-old native of Gaoyou who lives at 11 Hefeng Lane, Robert's Road, in the west of Shanghai, went to his hometown last year and recruited 13 women, bringing them to Shanghai to work in various cotton mills. Among these 13 women, one named Ren Huaxiang was in her prime and had a beautiful appearance. Recently, Wu secretly lured her to Shanghai without paying her a settlement allowance. However, this was discovered by the woman's fiancé's mother, Qian Zhang, because she had been living in Shanghai for a long time. Qian Zhang went to the address the day before yesterday and found the woman inside, so she took her away. Wu then grabbed Qian Zhang and called the police to arrest her at the Sixth District Police Station, accusing her of forcibly taking away a female worker. Qian Zhang also counter-accused Wu of luring the woman. The district chief conducted separate inquiries. According to Wu Chungen's statement, he is 42 years old and a native of Gaoyou. The woman, Ren Huaxiang, was entrusted to him by her parents to bring her to Shanghai to work, and Qian Zhang dared to forcibly take her away. He requested a thorough investigation. According to the woman, Ren Huaxiang, she is 20 years old and was tricked into coming to Shanghai by Wu last year. Her parents did not know about it. There were 13 women who were tricked into coming to Shanghai together. According to Qian Zhang, she is 48 years old and lives at 151 Xinkang Lane, Jiaxing Road. The woman, Ren Huaxiang, is the fiancée of her second son, and they are about to get married, so she was lured to Shanghai by Wu. She requested a thorough investigation. After obtaining the statements, the district chief found that the statements of both parties conflicted, so he immediately prepared a document and transferred it to the court for trial.</p>
<h3>Bizarre and Absurd</h3>
<p>A Woman's Pitiful Plea</p>
<p>A Person Endures Being Two Men's Wife</p>
<p>Failed Attempt to Sell Leads to Poisoning</p>
<p>Bound to a Tree, Kicked and Punched</p>
<p>Villagers Arrive to Rescue and Revive</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 4 a.m., near the Mujia Bridge in Zhabei, on the vacant land beside the Coal Dust Road, a middle-aged woman with a face like a pigeon and covered in mud was crawling along, kneeling and pleading to the police officer on duty at the fifth precinct of the fifth district: "I have been plotted against and harmed; please investigate and do justice," she said. The officer immediately took her to the station, where she identified herself as Zhang Zhou, a 31-year-old from Funing. Her husband's name is Zhang Huilian. They had been married for five years and lived in harmony, but recently he suddenly disliked my appearance and inability to bear children and wanted to leave me. However, I lost my parents at a young age and relied on my own hands to make a living, so I did not feel bitter. I originally intended not to marry again, but Zhang Huilian repeatedly begged me, and I finally agreed. I had hoped to be faithful to him until the end, but Zhang became tired of me over time, abandoned me halfway, secretly went to Suzhou, and privately transferred me to Tan San and Zhou Si Lang to be their wife. Due to financial difficulties, I endured being the shared wife of Tan and Zhou. Who knew that my fate would be so unfortunate? Tan and the others then wanted to sell me for money, but I swore I would not comply, which caused them to harbor resentment and plot against me. Last night after dinner, I was first raped in turns, and then they lured me outside, pretending to admire the night scenery. When we reached a vacant lot, they pushed me down. Zhou took out a thick rope and tightly bound it around my chest and neck, while Tan held my arms and tied me backward to a large tree. They kicked and punched me until I was suffocating. They then leisurely left. Fortunately, a villager passed by carrying vegetables and rescued me. It took half an hour for me to wake up and thankfully, I was revived." After giving her statement, she was panting like an ox, and when she bared her upper body, there was indeed a rope mark about a foot long, with bloodstains clearly visible. The chief of police examined her statement and found it overly absurd. He observed her demeanor, which resembled that of a madwoman. However, the rope marks on her chest and neck were definitely not fabricated, and her body was covered in wounds, suggesting that she had been plotted against and harmed. The case was quite bizarre, so he immediately prepared a document and sent it to the judicial section for review.</p>
<h3>On the Big Lai Steamer</h3>
<p>Chinese Woman's Coffin Awaits Collection</p>
<p>Zhang Yapei, a Woman from Suzhou</p>
<p>Worked as a Servant in America, Developed Mental Illness</p>
<p>Suddenly Hanged Herself in a Locked Room</p>
<p>Coffin Arrives in Shanghai, No One Claims It</p>
<p>The American Da Lai Company's world-class giant steamer, President Taft, arrived in Shanghai on the 16th of this month, carrying a coffin in its hold. The ship docked at the Da Lai Wharf in Bailianjing, Pudong. Soon after, the ship sent people to transport the coffin to the wharf and leave it there. It has been almost a week, and no one has claimed it yet. It has now been ascertained that the deceased in the coffin is a Chinese woman named Zhang Yapei (transliteration), 32 years old, from Suzhou. She used to work as a servant in the house of an American (referred to by foreigners as "amah"). For some unknown reason, she suddenly developed mental illness in America, and her behavior became abnormal. She would laugh and cry all day long and speak incoherently. Her employer became annoyed and confined her to a locked room, hoping she would recover and return to normal. Unexpectedly, the woman suddenly hanged herself on May 1st. By the time the employer discovered her, she had already died. They immediately purchased a coffin, prepared her for burial, and reported the matter to the authorities. A letter was prepared, and the coffin was carried onto the ship and transported to China. There were no obstacles along the way, and it arrived directly in Shanghai. However, it is not known whether the deceased has any family members, and even if she does, their address and names are unknown, making it extremely difficult to find them. Therefore, it has been delayed for many days, and no one has claimed it yet. The company believes that keeping the coffin for too long is unhygienic and has sent letters to various land and water authorities to investigate and inform the family so that they can claim the coffin.</p>
<h3>Co-habited for Seven or Eight Years</h3>
<p>Slept in the Same Bed Only Once</p>
<p>Brothel Keeper Accuses Husband</p>
<p>Criminal Case with Civil Suit Attached</p>
<p>Purpose is Divorce</p>
<p>Defendant Denies Everything</p>
<p>Li Xiaolianzi, a woman from Jiangbei, opened a brothel in Shanghai and accumulated a considerable amount of ill-gotten gains. Being in the prostitution business, she embraced the idea of multiple partners. Recently, she hired a lawyer at the Special District Court to file a criminal and civil lawsuit against her husband, Li Zaichao. The criminal part concerned allegations of theft by her husband, while the civil part sought to terminate their relationship. Using a two-pronged approach, she hoped to achieve her goal of changing husbands as soon as possible. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhou Daren opened the court to hear the divorce case. According to her statement, she is 36 years old and lost both parents at a young age. She had no siblings. The defendant's mother took me in as an adopted daughter. When I turned 19, the defendant forced me into a room and slept with me, without holding a wedding ceremony. Judge Zhou asked her how many times she had slept with the defendant. She replied, "Only this once." Asked if she had given birth to a child, she said, "I had a daughter, but she died soon after." But judging by the years, she must be eleven years old. The court instructed her, "According to this calculation, you have cohabited with the defendant for seven or eight years. Your statement that you slept together only once is highly improbable." The questioning turned to the defendant, Li Zaichao, who stated that he was two years older than the plaintiff. He and she were married at the time, arranged by his mother, and a wedding ceremony was held. The plaintiff had also given birth twice. He was 32 years old when he had a son, but they all died young. The defendant's mother was also called to testify about the circumstances of their marriage. Regarding the wedding certificate, she said that it had been lost over the years and was difficult to find, so it could not be presented to the court. Then the lawyers for both the plaintiff and defendant began their arguments. The defendant's lawyer, Ye Fikang, said that the woman had been married to the defendant for nearly ten years, and now she was denying it. This was disregarding national law and corrupting social customs. He requested that her lawsuit be rejected. Judge Zhou adjourned the hearing until May 27 for sentencing.</p>

<h3>Inside a Small Teahouse</h3>
<p>Large-Scale Flower Gambling Den Busted</p>
<p>Opening Gambling Three Times Day and Night</p>
<p>Flower Gambling Archway with Bizarre Shapes</p>
<p>Riddles on the Gambling Cards Are Peculiar</p>
<p>Chief Operator Sentenced to a Fine of 500 Yuan</p>
<p>The evils of flower gambling are well known. Recently, unscrupulous individuals have been opening gambling dens three times day and night. Therefore, the French Concession Police have paid close attention to this and instructed all police stations to strictly investigate and arrest those involved. On the day before yesterday at noon, the French Concession Police Detective Inspector General Shen Defu, Detective Bao Tan Shiqing, and others discovered a large-scale flower gambling den operating inside a small teahouse at No. 25 Yong'an Lane, behind Beile Road. They immediately proceeded to the address without making a sound and raided the place. At that time, the group was in the midst of gambling, in high spirits. They arrested the chief operator, Lin Yinfu, on the spot, while the others scattered and fled. They confiscated a flower gambling archway, covered with a large red satin cloth. On one side were written the words "One Hundred Taboos Are Forbidden," and on the other side were written "Kill All Sides." Red tassels were attached to both sides, and a copper plaque was placed on top with the words "Abundant Financial Resources, One Original Ten Thousand Profits." At the very top was a foreign iron tube about a foot long, containing the names of the flower gambling winners (the words "Occupying the First Place"), covered with red satin. There were also two sets of riddles written on the gambling cards, such as "Nezha Uproar in the Sea, Parents Angered, Taiyi Battles with Magic, Caishi Isle," and they also confiscated silver dollars and other items. They were taken to the police station and sent to the French Concession Court yesterday for investigation. First, Western Detective Chief Sacaier reported to the court that this type of flower gambling was completely deceptive and harmful to the people. These main dens are the most difficult to bust, but now that they have been arrested, he requested that they be severely punished. When questioned, Lin Yinfu admitted to privately opening a large flower gambling den. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Lin to a fine of 500 yuan. If he was unable to pay the fine, he would be imprisoned for 500 days as a warning. All confiscated items would be confiscated.</p>

<h3>Seven-Year-Old Girl Pawned for Thirty Silver Dollars</h3>

Ni filed a complaint with the Third Precinct of the Third Sub-station, which arrested Chen and sent him to the District Court for trial. Wu, however, fled. Ni later learned that Wu had fled to Huzhou and remarried to the owner of a shoe store named Lu An in the South Gate of Huzhou. He went there the day before yesterday and found Wu, bringing her back to Shanghai. He filed a complaint with the Third Precinct of the Third Sub-station.

<h3>Demand Extortion Case by Laid-Off Workers</h3>

<p>Plaintiff Requests Prosecution Under Criminal Law</p>
<p>Zhang Zi'an, manager of the Samsung Cotton and Iron Factory, was attacked and injured by Wang Kehua, a laid-off worker from the factory, at the entrance of the Yuxing Lane on Nanjing Road. The police arrested Wang and sent him to the Special District Court, where Judge Shen Shumu of the Simple Criminal Court ordered him to be detained pending further investigation, as reported in the previous newspaper. Since being fired, the worker had repeatedly used threatening means to extort money from Zhang. Now, Zhang Zi'an hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to file a lawsuit, requesting that he be punished under Article 318 of the Criminal Law. As the scope of the case was broader than initially thought and the Simple Court had no jurisdiction, Judge Shen transferred the case file to the Local Court. Yesterday, Judge Xu ordered the defendant Wang Kehua to be brought in for trial. Lawyer Zhan stated the circumstances of the defendant's repeated extortion, saying that after Wang was fired by the factory, he extorted money from Zhang. He was initially given 50 yuan, but soon after, he used the same trick again. The plaintiff, considering that he was unemployed, gave him another 56 yuan, and the defendant signed a statement promising not to cause any more trouble. Unexpectedly, he became even more extreme, writing threatening letters and demanding money from the plaintiff, so he filed a complaint requesting an investigation to warn the rascals. Judge Xu questioned the defendant and ordered him to be detained and a new date set to summon witnesses for further hearings.</p>

<p>Li Hu Shi and Others Arrested</p>
<p>Wang Caifu, a native of Changzhou, residing at No. 442 Guangdong Road above Wu Yixing Noodle Shop, made a living selling small books and practicing "tiao sha" (a traditional healing technique).

<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>May 22nd, 19th Year of the Republic of China (Fourth Page of Shen Bao)</p>
<p>and her whereabouts became unknown. Wang was extremely distraught by the sudden loss of his beloved daughter and reported the matter to the British and French Concession police, requesting an investigation. Later, he remembered that Xingdi had been taken away by Wu Youdi. He brought Wu to a tea party and demanded the return of Xingdi, but Wu firmly denied any involvement in enticing or hiding Xingdi. After mediation by the crowd, a Mr. Shi, who owned a woodworking shop, vouched for Wu, and the matter was settled. In reality, Wu had hidden Xingdi in the home of his friend, Zhang Delin, with the intention of selling her for profit. After two months of waiting and seeing no action, he colluded with Zhang's mistress, Li Hu Shi, to take Xingdi to Laobaidu in Pudong yesterday morning. They boarded the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha's Songshan Maru ship to sell her abroad. At 11:00 AM, just as the ship was about to set sail, investigators Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang from a relief organization boarded the ship. They found Wu and Xingdi and questioned them about their background, but their answers were inconsistent. They were taken to the Water Police Station together. According to Hu Shi's statement, she was 27 years old, from Changzhou, and was taking her niece to her father's place in Xiamen. Xingdi claimed she had been renamed Yang Guiying, her age falsely reported as nine, and that her mother had passed away. She said her father, Yang Rengen, was doing business in Xiamen, and she was going there with her aunt. The police chief did not believe her and interrogated her strictly. She finally confessed the entire story of being lured away, as well as her home address. She also said that the previous statement was taught by Hu Shi. The police chief verified the statements and concluded that Hu Shi and her accomplices were involved in human trafficking, with a meticulously designed plan and devoid of humanity. He ordered Detective Ge Changsheng to bring Xingdi's father, Wang Caifu, to the police station according to the address. When Xingdi saw her father arrive, she burst into tears and hugged him. Wang was overjoyed to have his long-lost daughter returned and was moved to tears. The police chief ordered that the plaintiffs and defendants be sent to the local court for disposition.</p>

He has been in business for many years and enjoys a good reputation, making him a target for criminals. Yesterday evening, around 8 PM, the store's employees had just finished dinner and were closing the iron gate at the front entrance when six thieves suddenly rushed in through the back door. Three of the thieves were armed with pistols. Several employees were talking at the entrance of the west wing room. They saw the six men rush in and knew they were not good people, so they quickly retreated into the west wing room and sounded the alarm. At the same time, the thieves turned off all the lights and three thieves took out flashlights and broke into the east wing room, the accounting room, and looted cash, totaling about 1,500 yuan. Two thieves kicked open the door of the west wing room and forbade any outcry. Unexpectedly, when the alarm first sounded, nearby detectives heard the alarm and reported it to the Big Ben police station. The police station immediately mobilized more than 30 on-duty detectives and rushed to the scene by car. They surrounded the house. By that time, the thieves had already obtained the loot and fired four shots in the house as a warning, shattering a piece of glass on the front window of the west wing. As they were leaving, trying to escape, one thief was about to open fire when he reached the alley entrance, but the detectives bravely rushed forward and apprehended him, recovering both the stolen goods and the thief. They were taken to the Big Ben police station. After a strict interrogation by the police chief, he ordered the thief to be detained and sent to court for trial.</p>

<h3>Ericsson Telephone Company's Opinion</h3>
<p>On the Advisory Committee's Report on the Sale of the China and Foreign Telephone Company</p>
<p>The sale of the China and Foreign Telephone Company has been reviewed by the advisory committee, which has completed its review of the bids from various potential buyers and presented its report to the public. This matter is related to the interests of telephone users and shareholders of the China and Foreign Telephone Company, so we dare to offer our opinions frankly.</p>
<p>The advisory committee's report stated that the standards for its decision were (1) to safeguard the interests of shareholders and (2) to safeguard the interests of users. Therefore, it is necessary to first know which bidder can improve service and completely install automatic telephones in the shortest possible time to ensure satisfaction. Thus, the advisory committee's standard for decision is to prioritize the interests of shareholders. Ericsson Company is willing to pay shareholders 100 taels of silver per share, while the International Telephone and Telegraph Company is only willing to pay 75 taels of silver per share. The advisory committee considers the price offered by the International Company to be fair. What method was used to estimate this fair price? According to Ericsson's estimate, the actual value of the China and Foreign Telephone Company's stock is 80 taels of silver per share, and the value of the company's brand and customers is 20 taels of silver per share. Is this not a fair price?</p>
<p>Since the advisory committee prioritizes the interests of shareholders, why does it prevent shareholders from obtaining an additional 25 taels of silver per share? The reason may be to safeguard the interests of users, but in fact, the opposite is true. The International Company requires an interest rate of 1.05% per week, while Ericsson Company requires an interest rate of 0.9%. The difference is 0.15%. By 1932, the capital that the International Company must pay is 13,100,020 taels of silver, requiring interest of 1,325,510 taels of silver. The capital that Ericsson Company must pay is 12,200,000 taels of silver, requiring interest of 1,080,000 taels of silver. The difference is 295,510 taels of silver. This annual interest of approximately 300,000 taels of silver will have to be borne by users in the future. If Ericsson Company's bid is accepted, this annual interest of approximately 300,000 taels of silver can be saved. Is this not in the interest of users?</p>
<p>The advisory committee considers the International Company's fast delivery to be one of its advantages. However, all three bidding companies have guaranteed their delivery dates in writing. Is our allowance for their guarantees insufficient for trust? As a matter of fact, the so-called fast delivery of the International Company refers to the central telephone exchange in this city. The order was placed in 1923, but the installation was not completed until 1927, when it could be used.</p>
<p>Another advantage of the International Company is that its employees are familiar with the operation of rotary automatic telephones and have received training. However, in fact, the so-called employees include only seven foreigners and fifty-nine Chinese who have received this training. The vast majority of the remaining employees will need to be trained before using this new equipment.</p>
<p>The advisory committee stated that the benefit presented by the International Company is the rapid improvement of telephones. However, regarding the installation and operation of Ericsson automatic telephones, which would be less expensive and could be completed within two years, the committee stated that it was not satisfied. Its distrust of Ericsson Company's ability to fulfill the bidding conditions is what we most oppose. Ericsson is a world-renowned company, and its promised conditions should be trusted by the world. During the advisory committee's inquiry, I informed them of the estimated value of the construction and proved that Ericsson-style (i.e., progressive) automatic telephones are cheaper and more economical than rotary automatic telephones in all aspects. Even the construction cost of Ericsson-style factories is less than half that of the International Company. We can compare the two telephone exchanges in Shanghai now. The East District telephone exchange is Ericsson-style and was installed in 1924. The Central District telephone exchange is rotary-style and was installed in 1927. According to Mr. Anson's opinion, the East District exchange is still in good condition and operates smoothly, while the Central District exchange, after three years of operation, requires costly repairs to operate smoothly. Therefore, after long-term testing, the advantages and disadvantages of the two exchanges have become extremely clear.</p>
<p>Ericsson Company also proposed using Strowger automatic telephones in its bid. However, the advisory committee stated that if Strowger-style telephones were used, the Telegraph and Telephone Trust Company would have to undertake the project. However, Ericsson Company has a large factory in Beeston, England, which manufactures Strowger-style equipment for the British Post Office. It can also cooperate with the Automatic Telephone Manufacturing Company in Liverpool, England, to ship Strowger-style equipment to China from its factory. All materials are British goods, and trained staff can be sent to manage the project. The advisory committee does not seem to have given sufficient attention to Ericsson Company's proposal and focused on the proposals of the International Company and the Trust Company, choosing between rotary-style and Strowger-style. Therefore, the advisory committee's decision is difficult to understand.</p>
<p>Ericsson Company has 50 years of experience in building telephone businesses around the world and is well-positioned to benefit the people of Shanghai. I am confident that you will give it due consideration and will not approve the advisory committee's report without considering it.</p>

<p>Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) announces that in the local news section of the "Shen Bao" on the 15th of this month, there was an article entitled "Shantou National Products Association Bitterly Criticizes the Harm of Superphosphate Fertilizer to Agriculture," which excerpted a letter issued on behalf of Shantou soybean cake merchants. It is claimed that ammonium sulfate superphosphate fertilizer has been tested and approved by the Agricultural Products Inspection Institute as suitable for use. However, the Shantou soybean cake merchants are suspicious because it is becoming popular. The increasing sales of ammonium sulfate superphosphate fertilizer and the declining sales of soybean cake are actually due to farmers who have used ammonium sulfate superphosphate fertilizer and have realized its various benefits. Ammonium sulfate superphosphate fertilizer is made from nitrogen extracted from the air and does not contain nitric acid. Air is essential for everyone to breathe, so it cannot be said to be highly toxic. Furthermore, artificial fertilizer merchants never mention a single word against the use of organic fertilizer. They are aware that organic fertilizer is beneficial for crops, but compared to ammonium sulfate superphosphate fertilizer, its effectiveness is weaker and slower. A better result can be achieved by using both organic and artificial fertilizers together. The letter claims that Japan, which is very advanced in agriculture, still does not use superphosphate fertilizer. This is not true. Last year, Japan imported 282,227 tons of ammonium sulfate superphosphate fertilizer, more than twice the amount imported by China. At the same time, Japan also produces large quantities of ammonium sulfate and other artificial superphosphate fertilizers. The speed at which their imports and production increase each year is rapidly growing. It is estimated that the amount of ammonium sulfate superphosphate fertilizer used this year will reach 600,000 tons. According to customs reports for 1928, China imported 12,656,254 piculs of rice. Given the vast area of rice paddies in China, its self-sufficiency in this staple food should be better than it currently is. To remedy this and make China self-sufficient, the productivity of each mu of rice paddy must be increased. In addition to using organic fertilizer, the only way to increase production is to promote the use of artificial fertilizers, as proven to be beneficial by countries around the world. The Liangchen Haoyou Society at the intersection of Beijing Road and Zhejiang Road announces that the society specializes in custom-made stationery and envelopes and undertakes fine art printing, which has always been highly regarded. Despite the impact of the gold standard, yellow envelopes are still priced at one yuan per thousand, three-layer envelopes at four yuan, and Lian Shi Kuojian and Maobian Kuojian stationery at two and a half yuan.

<p>The Medical Bookstore announces the latest reprint of six books: (1) "The Iron Club of the Medical World," written by K.Wada of Japan and translated by Ding Fubao. Modern scholars in China all dismiss traditional Chinese medicine as useless, not knowing that some aspects of traditional Chinese medicine are useful, while others are not. Those that are useful should be recognized, and those that are not should be eliminated. They should not be summarily dismissed as useless. Mr. Wada has a deep understanding of the essence of traditional Chinese medicine and has read extensively in Western medicine, accumulating a wealth of knowledge. Therefore, his criticisms of the shortcomings of Western medicine are often pertinent. Those who write hastily should not criticize him. Each copy costs 6.4 dimes, plus 1.1 dimes for postage. (2) "A Major Study of Neurasthenia," translated by Hua Wenqi and Ding Fubao. Neurasthenia can turn the strong into the weak and the intelligent into the dull, and those who collapse and die from it are countless.

After reading this book, those with neurasthenia may have hope. Each copy costs 2.4 dimes, plus 8.5 cents for postage. (3) "Annotations on the Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian" (Treatise on Action and Retribution), written by Yu Quyuan of the Qing Dynasty, contains extensive citations and elegant language, making it the best edition of the annotated "Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian" since its inception.

<h3>Pigeon Flies Faster Due to Yearning for Its Young</h3>
<p>The Japanese 11th Division recently held joint exercises, causing 20 military pigeons to fly 3,000 meters. As a result, three pigeons reached the distance in one minute. The normal flying speed of pigeons is 1,000 meters per minute at close range, so 3,000 meters is a rare record. The pigeon team studied the anomaly. According to Lieutenant Ogawa, the pigeon team leader, all three pigeons had chicks. Perhaps they were so eager to see their young that they flew the distance in one breath.</p>
<h3>The 15th U.S. Census</h3>
<p>The Country Divided into 574 Districts</p>
<p>100,000 Enumerators Conduct Survey</p>
<p>Since its founding, the United States has held a national census every ten years. This survey is the best record of the country's development. This year marks the 15th census, which began last month. The federal government hired 100,000 enumerators, who were sworn in before departing to various parts of the country. In addition to population statistics, they must also compile survey forms on agriculture, water conservancy, canal distribution, unemployment, mining, and manufacturing. The completeness of the survey categories is a first. Each enumerator carries a survey form and a map of the area they are surveying (with instructions). They must personally visit each place, meet with the responsible family member, inquire about everything, and fill out the form accordingly. Those who refuse to answer questions or provide false answers will be punished according to the law, or enumerators who abuse their power and illegally disclose the information obtained will also be punished. To ensure the accuracy of the survey, the country is divided into 574 supervisory districts, and one supervisor is carefully selected for each district to oversee all survey matters. The survey form contains 24 questions, which are more detailed than in the previous survey, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The relationship of each family member to the head of the household, and a description of the family's organization.</p>
<p>(2) Whether the family owns or rents the property.</p>

<h3>Treasures in an Egyptian Tomb</h3>
<p>The accidental discovery of an ancient tomb in Egypt has also spread around the world. The treasures unearthed are naturally antique, especially a few rare treasures, which are the most precious. I have received this news and will introduce it to the readers.</p>
<p>Location of the Tomb</p>
<p>The tomb was discovered not far from the Sphinx in Egypt. The Sphinx is one of Egypt's ancient monuments. There is a story behind it, which I will tell you now.</p>
<p>According to Greek mythology, "In the past, there was a female monster with wings, a human face, and a lion's body. She sat on a rock by the roadside and asked passersby a riddle: 'What has four legs in the beginning, then two legs, and then three legs? The one with the most legs is the youngest?' If they couldn't answer, she would kill them. Later, a man named Oedipus said, 'It is a human. Because when humans are born, they use their hands and feet to practice walking, so they have four legs. When they grow up, they walk on two legs. When they get old, they walk with a cane, so they appear to have three legs.' When the monster heard this, she threw herself into the sea and died."</p>
<p>Contents of the Tomb</p>
<p>Inside the tomb are nineteen small stone chambers, each containing dozens of female corpses separated by thick plasterboards, arranged neatly and without disorder. Among the stone carvings, the statue of Pharaoh Ra is the most magnificent. Pharaoh Ra was the most outstanding high priest in Egypt during his lifetime. Other strangely shaped statues of gods evoke sighs from viewers. The leopard head stone carving is also worthy of admiration, with its eyes wide open and full of life. Outside the stone chambers is a long, deep passage with a large plaster column placed upside down, sculpted with the portraits of the senior priests' families. Pharaoh Ra's statue is also embedded in it. Another chamber, about 15 yards in circumference, has a stone pillar inscribed with Pharaoh Ra's life deeds and the circumstances of his funeral. The paintings are realistic and the carvings are exquisite. An inscription is engraved on the corner of the pillar, which is still not eroded. It was probably written by Pharaoh Ra's family. There are also many sacrifices and miscellaneous items scattered on the ground. Judging from the types of sacrifices, one can imagine Pharaoh Ra's hobbies and lifestyle during his lifetime.</p>
<p>The Treasures of the Tomb</p>
<p>Around Pharaoh Ra's statue are many plaster long-necked bottles. The tomb excavators initially did not understand their purpose, but when they entered the stone chamber, they were greeted by a fragrant smell that refreshed their minds and bodies, as if there were fresh flowers planted in the bottles. Only then did they realize that flowers had once been planted in the bottles. However, the fragrance remained after thousands of years. Many people suspect that there are medicines left in the bottles, which is probably a strange and suspicious case. Among these antiques, the most beautiful and moving is a very large gold flower vase. The gold is dazzling and radiant. The vase is filled with gold flower branches, making it even more luxurious. According to antique collectors, there have never been such precious Egyptian antiques since they were discovered. Among the many necklaces, one is made of four thousand rubies strung on a gold chain. Next to the necklace is a papyrus detailing the making of the necklace. It is said that this necklace was Pharaoh Ra's most cherished treasure during his lifetime. Later, when Pharaoh Ra married, he gave this treasure to his daughter-in-law as a greeting gift.

<h3>Stories of World Literature (I)(V)(VIII) Translated by Hu Zhongchi from American John Macy</h3>
<p>Chapter 40 The Classical Era of German Literature</p>
<p>Gotthold Ephraim Lessing was a playwright, scholar, thinker, and critic. First of all, he wrote beautiful prose. He thought he lacked creative power, and as is often forgotten, he forgot that the great literary style itself is creation at the highest level. Some of his critical essays and theological pamphlets lack the reality of content today. This is the same fate that Lucian and Swift had. However, no critic of painting or poetry would dare to say that they do not know "Laocoön," and no critic or historian of drama would dare to say that they do not know "Hamburg Dramaturgy," and no researcher of thinkers would dare to say that they do not know "The Education of the Human Race" or "Fragments of the Wolfenbüttel Anonymous." The above works and other completely worthless works are valuable to those who love literature by virtue of that clear and brilliant talent, and eloquence, and the perfection of construction. Contact with Lessing's spirit, no matter how he handles the raw material, is called free education. Why? Because what Johnson wrote on Goldsmith's tombstone can be suitably applied to him: "There was no kind of writing that he did not attempt, and there was no writing that he touched that he did not adorn." One cannot speak of Lessing the playwright with the same respect, but rather more calmly. He gave the German people the first classical comedy in "Minna von Barnhelm" and the first poetic drama in high position in "Nathan the Wise." Both works are still popular on stage. However, "Minna von Barnhelm" has not faded at all, and even with "Nathan the Wise," it can be said that the highest value lies in the re-explanation of the author's noble, tolerant, and clear mind.</p>
<p>It is difficult to simply explain Goethe, the greatest of the German writers and one of the greatest figures in all of literature. He is the most modern figure among the greatest masters, and therefore the most complex in spirit, temperament, and activity. Dante represents the medieval worldview and cosmology, Shakespeare represents the moral order of the Renaissance, and Goethe does not represent anything. He is a modern man, one who seeks to make life crystallize into art. He is a first-rate lyric poet. "Faust" bears the same relationship to modern people as the Divine Comedy did to the people of the fourteenth century.</p>
<p>He is the author, and "Faust" expresses us - our times, problems, moral adventures, and is composed of letters, conversations, maxims, wind poems, rhymes, and prose maxims. It constitutes a vast range and permanent significance of the literature of wisdom, in which all the difficult problems and activities of the modern or scientific era are elaborated creatively with words that resonate with all educated people.</p>

<h3>British Foreign Trade Increasingly Declining</h3>
<p>Unprecedented Slump in Nine Years</p>
<p>Exports of All Major Commodities Decrease</p>
<p>Unemployment Rises Sharply to 1.6 Million</p>
<p>London News: British commerce continues to slump, with the situation in April being particularly bad, the worst since 1921 (excluding a certain month during the 1925 General Strike). Exports for the month were 47 million pounds, a decrease of 13 million pounds from the same period last year, or a decrease of 23 percent. Imports were 84 million pounds, a decrease of 20 million pounds from the same period last year, or a decrease of 20 percent. The reasons for this are partly due to the overall drop in special prices, partly due to the closure of wool mills, and partly due to the halt of Lancashire's cotton trade with India. But the main reason is the general slump, as the exports of all major ports have shrunk. This slump has increased the momentum of Lord Beaverbrook's Empire Free Trade movement, while protectionists are also quite active. Furthermore, British industry is exhausted, and unemployment is increasing. On April 28, the number reached 1.69 million, an increase of 38,000 from the previous two-week period and an increase of 530,000 from the same period last year.</p>
<h3>Taiwan's Population at 4,550,000</h3>
<p>An Increase of 110,000 from the Previous Year</p>
<p>Chinese Number 41,570</p>
<p>According to an investigation by the Taiwan Governor-General's Police Bureau, at the end of last year, the number of households in each state of the island was 288,086, the male population was 2,338,192, the female population was 2,218,269, totaling 4,556,461 people. Compared with the same period last year, the number of households increased by 49,047, and the population increased by 115,095. Among these were 10,054 households of Chinese, totaling 41,578 people. There were 63,353 households of Japanese, with 114,828 males and 100,965 females, totaling 215,793 people, an increase of 2,727 households and 9,781 people. There were 93 households of Koreans, totaling 565 people. Furthermore, in Taichung Prefecture, there were 804 households of Chinese, totaling 4,225 people, and 8,101 households of Japanese, totaling 26,872 people. The number of native island households was 159,288, totaling 970,329 people. There were 4 households of Koreans, totaling 62 people, and 7 households of foreigners, totaling 12 people.</p>
