<h3>各國之海軍派</h3>
<p>各國海軍派對此次倫敦公約均表不滿意法两國姑勿論即以日英美三國言日本之海軍派在公約未簽字前對美妥協案即表反對今尙在議會糾紛之中美國之海軍派亦曾一度表示不滿今且提出一千兆元之造艦案定在以後八年内造竣雖表面爲求足與英有同等力量然其亟亟以謀海軍勢力之發展巳顯然可見英之前海軍大臣白里志曼子爵昨在上院責政府不顧少軍專家勸告而遽將巡艦力减至危險程度傑立柯伯爵亦謂海會僅减少英國海軍而未减少他國海軍英國巡艦力實不足保衞海上利益三國海軍派之表示如此則今後海上競爭之情勢亦大略可覩矣</p>
<p>夫海軍派以本身地位言所任職務言固無足怪者蓋海軍旣以國防爲惟一之責任當然不願自减其力量當然不能不思患預防故不能以海軍派表示不滿而遽疑某國某國有若何野心也惟觀英美海軍派所言非特表示不滿且皆若憤憤不平有悔此一舉之意美海軍委員長白列登今日在議會宣言謂美稱首富海軍豈能居他國後以後决不再勸英日作進一步縮减尤爲顯然夫以首倡和平動議軍縮之美而忽作此語吾誠不能不爲和平前途悲也更可慮者意外相今日在國會演說大倡堅持與法同等軍力之議國會議員亦力攻法國且表示意國軍力之强大大有不惜一戰以試手段之意此種語態不啻將棒喝黨數年來爭霸歐洲之雄心盡情暴露軍縮破裂之危機其在是歟</p>

<h3>二百米</h3>
<p>七人參與比賽周兆元以極快之發脚佔得第一始終在前未曾落後惜在最後三二米時美人湯史雷奮力追上達終點時勝周約一步功夫爲二十三秒五分一此賽劉長春脚傷未參與但鍾連基亦未與賽减少興趣不少</p>
<h3>四百米</h3>
<p>僅五人與賽麥國珍先聲奪人領居前鋒美之史湯雷緊隨其後及最後四五十米時湯飛步衝前極見功夫麥國珍卒致落後相差約二碼耳成績爲五十三秒</p>
<h3>八百米</h3>
<p>嗚槍起步鄧志明一路佔先步子輕捷身體靈敏以二分九秒五分之二達終點得第一第二爲郎大奎競爭甚烈相去不遠</p>
<h3>一萬米</h3>
<p>姜雲龍未參加遂少一健將中國爲趙德新陳虚舟龍龍澤咸三人起步後三人互相追逐一路領先當十九圈時陳德新氣力不濟而致退塲陳虚舟與龍澤咸遂决雌雄西人無傑出人才落後均有一二圈之多結果龍第一陳第二成績爲三六分五十秒五分四</p>
<h3>千五百米</h3>
<p>與賽者中國三人外僑五人動令下後吾國姜雲龍即居前茅脚步吃緊趙德新宋澤安尾之於後相距甚近第三圈時美之傑姆司奮步衝前追隨姜後最後轉灣趙德新怱告奮勇超出姜雲龍姜之功夫固在趙之上距終點約百米時姜突然衝出步子放大再接再厲結果趙落後有五六米姜得第一美之傑姆司第三守澤安第四成績四分二十三秒打破去年姜東華北運動會中所造四分二四秒五分三之成績造成全國新紀錄</p>
<h3>八百米接力</h3>
<p>吾國選手爲周恩德麥國珍鍾連基周兆元以一分五三秒五分一造成全國新紀錄四人功夫甚佳外僑落後有三四十米之遥</p>
<h3>鉛球</h3>
<p>前次全運會中潘南順得第一而此次潘退居第四逯明以十三米四五之成績造成全國新紀錄第二第三均爲美人</p>
<h3>擲鐵餅</h3>
<p>張齡佳在全運會不幸落選昨日乃以三十四米六三之遠度造成全國新紀錄美人第二趙文藻第三成績爲二九米七五第四亦爲美人</p>
<h3>擲標槍</h3>
<p>潘南順在全運會以四四米餘之成績造成新紀錄昨日屈居第三第一王季淮之成績並不佳美僅四一米六一二</p>
<h3>跳遠</h3>
<p>趙汝功在全運會跳遠屈居第四昨日乃以六米四二之遠度奪得第一較其江大成績尙差郝春德第二王季淮蕭鼎華再次之</p>
<h3>跳高</h3>
<p>美人入此項者多我國全運會未入選者亦再試可謂人才濟濟李仲三以一米七九七（五呎十吋半）之高度造成全國新紀錄何通第二成績亦佳五呎八吋傅寳瑞第三五呎七吋李琳與美人韋而衞以五呎五吋並列第四</p>
<p>跳高第一李仲三</p>
<p>（王開攝）</p>

<p>司徒光以十三米七二之成績破司徒君之全國最高紀錄十三米二一二四蕭鼎華亦以十三米五五破全國紀錄成績甚佳</p>
<h3>撑竿跳高</h3>
<p>冠軍竟爲西人成績並不佳僅三米三五曹裕以腿痛過三米二六即休息否則穩得第一符陳以三米一五五並列第四</p>
<h3>女子百米</h3>
<p>吾國幾至全軍覆及僅孫桂雲得一第四第一二三名均爲美國然成績極弱（十四秒）以孫桂雲過去之成績奪得第一亦屬極易而此次竟落第四寗非怪事</p>
<h3>女二百米接力</h3>
<p>吾國第一第二吳梅仙劉靜貞二人俱佔優勝第二六劉有慶當居前茅不料最後孫桂雲接棒時未能緊凑以致被美之范愛佛一躍居先奪得第一深爲可惜</p>
<h3>女子五十米</h3>
<p>女子五十米吾國孫桂雲爲個中翹楚觀衆視線咸注目於孫安知角逐結果孫落居第二吳梅先攫得第一吳之衝剌功夫甚佳起步後即一鼓作氣領前約半米終點時相差亦甚微競爭之烈於此可見第三名爲湯姆生第四劉有慶時間七秒五分之二</p>

<h3>德商會對我國商品之意見</h3>
<p>駐德使館之來函</p>
<p>上海商品檢騐局前爲調查德國對於吾國商品意見經函請駐德使館代爲徽集寄來該國不來梅等两商會意見曾誌各報茲該使館復接到柏林及漢堡两商會對於吾國皮料絲綢及茶業意見轉寄來局所言尤足爲我國商人借鏡特爲節錄如下</p>
<p>概述中國出口貨物之數目與成色對於世界市塲發展之趨勢巳不克保守其原有狀况昔日最暢銷之出口貨今巳一落千丈我中國倘能從事振興出口貨口須注意以下之攺革（一）增加産（二）攺良成色（三）减低價值中國對於農業出産品物之增加實最爲重要地大物博如中國富腴之地多未開墾其故一部份基於中國人民公衆組織之薄弱大部份則以國内變亂頻仍戰事迄無密止此爲對於擴充開墾之最大阻力中國出口貨物成色之不良咎在商人之不道德詐僞取巧混攙劣貨希圖增加重量等舉凡中國最著名出産貨物無不有此等現象如豆及榖種内混以汚物及碎石致於船運前須加以清潔躭誤運輸時間棉花則使之潮濕雀毛及猪鬃混以汚穢及石灰頭髮織品則　物過多菜油則和以賤值之劣貨皮則使之過度潮濕貨值低落以上所云半基於中國商人無道德心其他原因在經濟上之不發展經濟組織未臻完善就價值論以商人之不道德及詐僞受不良之影響且中國内地商業組織須經掮客參加路途遼遠及不靖常稅及非常稅而外尙有非法强迫之雜稅皆爲增加貨值之大原因凡此皆可由政治經濟之原則攺善如國内政治敉平攺良及添設交通道路减低國家稅取消非法的雜稅則中國之出口貨物固不難振興也</p>
<p>生絲中國本爲世界上生絲輸國惟近二十年來巳名不符實故步自封日本近二十五年來出産增加十倍一躍而爲領導世界大市塲之主人翁此未能謂中國生絲出産退化實因世界市塲需用生絲數目非常增加中國不能迎合潮流應時攺良此爲失敗之最大原因而缺乏向外推銷發展尤爲致命傷中國養蠶與生絲出産缺乏之原因在（一）蠶種之染病（二）偏重於陳舊及原始式樣之繭之紡織中國今日對於養蠶及出産攺良之需要實無疑養况中國本爲生絲之發源地將來恢復世界上生絲運輸國之美名想非難事也</p>
<p>茶近年來中國茶市之衰落巳無可諱言舉凡各國之有茶癖者對於嗜好中國紅茶之興味巳不克保留雖各國之嗜茶者日見其多而華茶之銷路其滯如故也歐洲大戰前德國嗜紅茶者達百分之八十五今日僅百分十五耳其他各國除俄國外對於紅茶巳不樂購用但綠茶之銷路則較勝此種調換口味之原因實因紅茶每况愈下以視印度錫蘭等處所植之茶或因栽培得法及製鍊精良較優於華茶亦未可料因華茶類多墨守成法不知攺良故相形見絀也　　皮革中國之生皮毛在市面上巳習慣成爲一種不良景象其原因頗爲複雜中國農夫大都缺乏正當經騐皮革並未展開至恰可尺寸祗在空氣中吹乾再由販客經二次至三次之浸濕此種辦法令皮革變硬或毛面上受汚甚者皮革伸張過度致令獸之原形完全失去中國之舊式硝皮法於多數毛皮貨成績甚佳近日在大商業中樞多採用外國硝皮法此法未盡完美因所硝之皮時有蒸發及變色之虞且往往不能十分乾透在中國境内如上海潮熱夏季氣候固甚難使皮貨乾透也</p>

<h3>金融銀洋盛况一瞥</h3>
<p>厘拆早疲午　劃頭加水大緊</p>
<p>市塲概况近日絲繭·雜糧·軍需各貨等需要銀洋两種欵項殊爲股繁故金融界業務狀况頓添不少興趣而手續上亦覺忙碌逾恒形勢驟然振興價格方面雖久滯之時要亦平增許多風光兼之昨值十日比期錢莊收解手續本較平時加多因適逢其會氣象遂而增色云　　厘拆價格「洋厘」晨間人心蘭散不勁收盤厘價較前午跌小一毫二忽半爲七錢一分九厘八亳七忽半迨至午市怱然加堅買氣大盛而集會時間延長二十分鐘之久結果收盤價爲七錢二分零二亳半較早市攺漲三亳七忽半「銀拆」早市七分頭襯適度午市怱爾堅緊銀拆高至一錢一分而劉頭加水遽增至一錢四五分究其漲因聞係銀行收欵較多劃頭頭襯不敷支配所致</p>
<p>輔幣市情江南小洋平淡無奇早午市價皆爲六錢二分九厘半與前日一式做出交易亦僅早市一千五百角午市一千角廣東小洋昨又回堅一厘計早市爲六錢零一厘午市爲六錢零一厘三亳七忽半結果較前日午市計昂一厘做出交易早市十萬零五千角午市二萬五千角客路去胃七萬角銅元忽縮二千五百文爲三百九十四千五百文</p>
<p>銀洋進出「銀欵」昨日錢莊因值大比期收解較繁計銀公單收解有三千八百餘萬之多劃頭欵亦有四百餘萬各路匯欵仍祇九十餘萬解現數百萬銀行方面以星期六收解較少計華商收解票欵二百餘萬外商一百四五十萬各種貨匯稅雜諸欵收解八百餘萬特收欵項一百八九十萬進倉二百萬日商銀行收解各欵四百餘萬出倉三十萬「洋欵」滙劃票欵早市做出二百零五萬午市一百三十四萬交易之多達於極點鈔票交易早市一萬五千塲外鈔票午市十五萬三千午市十二萬六千現洋早市十九萬午市十三萬五千英洋三萬五千銀行交易早市互市六十萬午市四十萬各銀行洋户往來收解一百七十餘萬鈔票進出二百數十萬錢莊洋公單收解六百四十餘萬洋劃頭欵收解三百二十餘萬拆借洋欵一百二十餘萬小錢莊交易六十餘萬客路來源仍祇六十餘萬去胃繭欵一百六十餘萬</p>
<h3>解米欵劃頭加緊</h3>
<p>吾國因産米各區或爲客秋歉收或爲連歲戰荒以致當此青黄不接之候民食缺乏米價騰貴於是仰給於洋米之輪入即如昨日金融界之代米商解出米欵核數不下二百萬两聞由華商代解於外銀行間接匯劃欵解赴國外是以昨日劃頭大緊殆即此故</p>
<h3>標金漲勢益猛</h3>

<h3>棉市又轉軟勢</h3>
<p>棉市平疲美棉亦略疲本埠人氣轉鬆近期因謡傅日商做空散户均慌且恒大商了結一千一百担於是市勢尤鬆惟遠月漢帮拉緊不放某廠後本月抵進放出十月故升降尙不出二錢範</p>
<p>期棉近跌遠平漢標前市開盤本月趨疲先跌一錢遠月漢帮抬住尙能站住結果本月跌一錢遠月平穩午後形勢略疲某大户購近賣遠各月又跌一錢遠月仍不動全日成交統漢標收盤漲跌存賑數　　　　七三五二五跌五六五○○○</p>

Most have been deployed from Zhengzhou to Kaifeng and Lanfeng. Currently, about 70,000 to 80,000 Jin and Northwest troops are stationed in Zhengzhou.

Since the 5th, six or seven airplanes have attacked Zhengzhou daily, dropping bombs. The Northwest army sometimes uses anti-aircraft guns to retaliate, with loud cannon fire. Citizens keep their doors closed. Soldiers on trains flee under the trains. Zhengzhou merchants and residents are all fleeing north. The station is extremely chaotic. The train departing from Zhengzhou at 8:00 AM on the 8th was the last. Transportation is feared to be completely cut off thereafter. (Telegram on the 10th)</p>

<h3>Chen Gongbo and Others Discuss Party and Government Issues</h3>
<p>First establish the Secretariat of the Central Party Headquarters, convene an enlarged meeting to produce the highest-level cadres.</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo and others discussed last night at the Lihua Hotel in Dongjiaomin Lane, Beiping, stating that the Taiyuan meeting was for restoration of unity, and the Tianjin meeting was for continuing unity. The Enlarged Central Committee has fourteen people from Guangdong and Shanghai, and seven from the Yan and Feng faction, totaling twenty-one. (Special telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>A certain party member in Beiping said that all the committee members from Taiyuan can arrive in Beiping within five days. A preparatory meeting will be held on the first day, and a party affairs meeting will be held on the second day to issue declarations and organize cadres. First establish the Secretariat of the Central Party Headquarters, and then the secretariat will convene advanced members of the party to hold an enlarged meeting to produce the highest-level cadres and convene a political meeting. The candidates for the political meeting are not limited to party members, in order to broaden the appeal. Special telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>The soon-to-be-established Secretariat of the Central Party Headquarters plans to nominate three standing committee members and hire some employees to handle daily affairs. (Special telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee for welcoming Wang Jingwei will convene today. (Special telegram on the 9th) Beiping Yan answers the Taiyuan delegation that the establishment of the government will be resolved by the Beiping party and government meeting. (Special telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>Starting from the 9th, important figures from the Shanxi, Northwest, and Western Hills reorganization factions arrived in Beiping one after another. An extraordinary meeting or enlarged committee will be held soon to engage in concrete actions to organize the government. (Telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>Excellent telegrams from Nanjing and Beiping: (1) Yan's intention to form a government is now active again, still planning for a cabinet system with power concentrated in the president. (2) The Reorganization Faction and the Western Hills Faction's plans to seize power and deceive through the party have now been completely exposed. Yan's attitude towards these two factions is extremely cold. Warlords from the Northern Warlord Alliance, such as Qi Xieyuan, Zhang Zhitian, Shi Jingyun, Sun Fufang, Wu Guangxin, and Wu Peifu, are all taking the opportunity to be highly active. (3) Right-wing leaders Zou Lu and Xie Chi, among others, were rejected by left-wing leaders Chen Gongbo and Wang Jingwei, among others, and deeply realize that cooperation between the left and right factions is impossible. Recently, seeing Yan luring the Northern Warlords and organizing activities, Zou Lu and Xie Chi secretly sent their agents to lobby the Northern Faction, hoping to secure a position when the government is successfully formed in the future.

<h3>He Chengjun Leaves Hankou for Northern Inspection</h3>

<p>Grey telegram from Nanjing, Tianjin: (1) Zhengzhou News: Liu Ruming's troops currently stationed in Xichuan are facing a food shortage and cannot obtain supplies through forced requisitions. Soldiers have been without food for several days, and morale is low. (2) Yue Xiangru led troops to invade in late last month and was fiercely attacked by our army, resulting in a defeat and retreat to Feihekou. The earthen stockades stubbornly resisted and were surrounded by our new 21st Division, Li Regiment at Yuwan, resulting in numerous casualties. The enemy was unable to hold on and fled north to Feihekou under the cover of darkness in a disorganized rout. Our army has already secured Feihekou, Baima Station, and other locations. (10th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Naval Factions of Various Countries</h3>
<p>The naval factions of various countries have expressed dissatisfaction with the London Naval Treaty. Leaving aside France and Italy, even in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, the Japanese naval faction opposed the compromise agreement with the United States even before the treaty was signed, and is still causing disputes in the parliament. The American naval faction also once expressed dissatisfaction, and is now proposing a one trillion yuan naval construction plan to be completed within the next eight years. Although ostensibly to seek equal strength with the United Kingdom, its eagerness to develop naval power is obvious. The former First Lord of the Admiralty of the United Kingdom, Viscount Bridgeman, criticized the government in the House of Lords yesterday for disregarding the advice of military experts and drastically reducing the strength of cruisers to a dangerous level. Earl Jellicoe also said that the conference only reduced the British navy without reducing the navies of other countries, and that the British cruiser strength was insufficient to protect maritime interests. Given the expressions of the naval factions of the three countries, the future situation of naval competition can be roughly foreseen.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that naval factions express such views, considering their positions and responsibilities. Since the navy's sole responsibility is national defense, it naturally does not want to reduce its strength and naturally cannot help but consider potential dangers and take precautions. Therefore, we cannot immediately suspect that a certain country or a certain country has ulterior motives simply because the naval faction expresses dissatisfaction. However, the words of the British and American naval factions are not only expressions of dissatisfaction, but also seem to be indignant and regretful of this decision. The chairman of the U.S. Naval Affairs Committee, Mr. Britten, declared in Congress today that the United States, as the wealthiest country, should not let its navy be behind other countries and will never again advise the United Kingdom and Japan to further reduce their forces, which is especially evident. The fact that the United States, which initially proposed peace initiatives and military reduction, has suddenly made such a statement makes me truly sad for the future of peace. Even more worrying is that Italian Foreign Minister Grandi, in his speech in the National Assembly today, strongly advocated maintaining military strength equal to that of France, and members of the National Assembly also strongly criticized France and expressed Italy's intention to demonstrate its power through war. This kind of language exposes the Fascist Party's ambition to dominate Europe, and the crisis of military reduction collapsing is imminent.</p>

<h3>Silk Exhibition Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>The National Silk Exhibition in Nanjing held its opening ceremony at 1:00 PM on the 10th. Representatives from various agencies and organizations, numbering 500 to 600 people, attended. Zheng Hongnian, the chairman, delivered an opening speech, stating that the Chinese silk industry is declining day by day and the economy is on the verge of danger. Therefore, the exhibition provides an opportunity to promote domestic goods and remedy the losses. He hoped that various factories would cater to the psychology of both Chinese and foreign societies, adapt to social needs, and actively improve, and that the government and the financial community would provide full assistance. Duan Bingzhang, the representative of the Executive Yuan, gave an instructional speech. Economic experts Lou Tongsun and Wei Tingsheng were then invited to speak. Lou's speech emphasized: 1. The reasons for the decline of domestic products are numerous, but the fundamental reason is the economic aggression of imperialism. 2. The history of Western countries shows that they gradually became wealthy from poverty. The reason for their wealth is the development of industrial products. 3. When buying clothing, one should not only consider personal economic factors but also national economic factors. 4. Western department stores are meticulous in their publicity methods and pay special attention to the women's sector, which should be emulated. Wei's speech emphasized: 1. The silk industry in China developed earliest and is a major expression of national culture. Therefore, loving the country requires promoting national quintessence. 2. The current fashion trends favor Zhongshan suits and Western suits, but the raw materials do not necessarily have to be wool and serge. The opportunity can be taken to use scientific methods to make the quality of silk fabrics hard, durable, and colorfast, so that people will be happy to use them. 3. The improvement of silk fabrics must incorporate artistic and popular elements, making them beautiful and inexpensive so that ordinary people can easily purchase them. 4. When merchants display goods, they can distinguish between domestic and foreign goods and between goods made by domestic workers and non-domestic goods, so that it is clear at a glance, and those who are happy to use</p>

<h3>Open Strife and Secret Struggles: The Naval Arms Race Among Nations</h3>
<p>Britten's Naval Bill Explanation: America is unwilling to be second to others. Senators challenge France, declaring that they will never abandon the demand for equality.</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 9th: Chairman Britten of the House Naval Affairs Committee spoke in the House today in favor of the Naval Bill, stating that British and American navies should be built to an equal status. America will no longer take the lead in advising Britain and Japan to make further reductions in the number of warships. He anticipates that Britain and Japan will fully build the ships permitted under the London Naval Treaty. America is the richest country in the world, so how can its navy lag behind other countries? In summary, America should not concede too much in naval construction. Even in terms of national prestige, it should have a navy on par with Britain.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 9th: Chairman Flandreau of the Naval Expenditure Allocation Committee announced today that if America does not fully build the warships permitted under the London Naval Treaty and saves 1 trillion yuan in national expenditures, it can be in a stronger position at the 1935 naval conference. At that time, America can generously agree to continue reducing its navy without destroying new ships. Furthermore, if various tonnage classes are not adequately filled, there will be room for improvement in warship design or tactics at any time. Mr. Flandreau's remarks were in response to Chairman Britten of the House Naval Affairs Committee advocating for an increase in warships. However, Mr. Britten remained unmoved and still proposed a warship construction program costing $936,995,000, claiming this was necessary to make the American navy equal to that of Britain.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 9th: Italian parliamentarian Di Ronoya stated in parliament that French Foreign Minister Briand consistently attempted to establish a Four-Power Pact during the London Conference to isolate Italy, but unexpectedly failed at the hands of Italy's chief representative. This was also unexpected by Mr. Briand. He also stated that Italy can never abandon its naval demands with France, as this concerns the survival of the nation. France disregards today's Italy, not knowing that we are no longer the Italy of before the war. If France is determined to seize the fruits of our victory and attempts to create European hegemony under the pretext of security, we Italians will never listen to its actions. Please France recognize this point. At that time, all the parliamentarians applauded wildly, and the Italian newspapers also responded enthusiastically to this statement.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 9th: Italian Foreign Minister Grandi reported to the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon on the London Naval Conference for two hours. One of the most noteworthy parts was his statement on equality with France, stating that naval equality is a principle of moral international rights based on mutual trust between nations. If Italy calculates its armaments according to its needs, equality would still be insufficient. However, he is optimistic about the future, stating that if Europe wishes to restore its prosperity, French-Italian cooperation is essential.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 9th: British Foreign Minister Henderson spoke with French Foreign Minister Briand for two hours this afternoon. The press release stated that they discussed international political issues. Evening newspapers stated that the diplomacy discussed by the two countries was the new situation arising from Italy's warship construction program. It was also stated that Henderson inquired about the progress of France-Italy negotiations alone, but Briand was unable to answer. The British Foreign Minister is willing to mediate after arriving in Geneva.</p>

<h3>British Aircraft Demonstration</h3>
<p>Order Restored in Asura</p>
<p>Reuters, Simola, 9th: Forty British aircraft flew over Turangzai yesterday, the residence of Muslim preacher Wahid, to demonstrate force. It was heard that the preacher had accepted an invitation from the North Xia Hua Congress Committee to recruit 100,000 soldiers to invade North Xia Hua territory. It is said that this action has had a deterrent effect on the Muslim tribes.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 9th: Recent news from Asura states that the situation there is gradually calming down. Police cars patrol the streets and main roads, and soldiers are stationed there. The Governor of Asura now states that order has indeed been restored. It is estimated that a total of twenty people died in the riots, including police officers, and one hundred were injured.</p>
<p>Reuters, Pune, 9th: It is now known that the Asura riots began on May 7 when some workers demonstrated outside a factory that was not on strike. Police drove them away, but the crowds dispersed and regrouped, burning several hotels. Nothing happened at night, but on the morning of the 8th, volunteers from the Nationalist Party arrived, intending to burn wine palm trees. Workers and others joined them, numbering no less than 30,000. The Governor and Police Chief led several European and Indian soldiers and police officers to the scene to persuade the volunteers not to burn the wine palm trees. The crowds did not listen and threw stones at them, injuring the Governor and Police Chief. They then ordered warning shots to be fired, but the crowds became even more enraged and surrounded the Governor and others. The military and police desperately broke through the encirclement and the rioters captured one police officer and burned him alive, and killed two other police officers. Afterwards, they marched directly into the public office and burned down the police station and court. When police reinforcements arrived from other places, the crowd dispersed. The whereabouts of five police officers are still unknown, and it is estimated that they were thrown into wells by the rioters. Today, the atmosphere in Asura is very calm, and a troop of soldiers is stationed to prevent disturbances because tomorrow is the anniversary of the Indian Mutiny.</p>
<p>Difficulties in the Japanese Parliament</p>
<h3>The Government is Expected to Survive</h3>
<p>The Seiyukai Party Plans to Launch a Final Attack; the Actions of Finance Minister Are Notable</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 10th: Yesterday's plenary session of the House of Peers opened at 10:00 a.m. The anti-government member, Hanaizumi Takuzo, pursued the government on the issue of command authority. Prime Minister Hamaguchi, as usual, responded vaguely and avoided giving a clear answer, thus thwarting Hanaizumi's sharp attack. Next, Fujiyama Raizo advocated for the government to postpone various reconstruction projects as a way to provide unemployment relief, leading to questions and answers between him and the government. However, his arguments were somewhat abstract and lacked novelty. The parliamentary battle in the House of Peers has now passed through a difficult stage. Although the session is pressing, it is unlikely that major disturbances will occur, and important bills will be passed. The issue of command authority is unlikely to develop further, and the remaining issues are only reverberating in the Privy Council. However, this is unlikely to cause a major incident, and the government is quite optimistic.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 10th: The Seiyukai Party plans to launch a final attack on the government. This morning, it submitted a resolution on economic issues to the House of Representatives. The content of the resolution criticizes the government's misguided countermeasures after the lifting of the gold embargo and points out failures in various policies, including financial, economic, industrial, and unemployment measures. The reasons for the proposal will be explained by Yamamoto Itaro, former president of the South Manchuria Railway, and several other skilled debaters will be deployed to launch a total attack. The resolution is scheduled to be put on the agenda at today's plenary session. However, if Ozaki Yukio's motion to impeach the government for violating discipline is put on the agenda, the Seiyukai's resolution may be postponed until tomorrow.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 10th: The conflict between the Japanese government and the Naval General Staff is showing signs of worsening. When Finance Minister's return is resolved, the issue will become more complicated. Finance Minister Zaibu, who is staying in Harbin, is exchanging telegrams with Tokyo. In today's chaotic parliamentary situation, he has revealed that he cannot return home rashly. Therefore, the attitude of Finance Minister Zaibu at this time is extremely noteworthy.</p>

The cabinet has refused to approve the bill, and the Home Minister stated today that the government, in principle, supports women's suffrage but advocates for a step-by-step approach.</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting Between Philippine Military Police and Bandits</h3>
<p>Moro Bandit Fortress Razed to the Ground</p>
<p>Associated Press, Manila, 10th: According to a telegram sent today by Mr. Huffington, Governor of Lana Province, received by the Philippine government's Non-Christian Tribes Affairs Bureau, a large group of Moro bandits firmly occupied a village fortress in the Kawayan district of Mindanao Island and fought fiercely with the Philippine police. As a result, the police won a hard-fought victory and the entire village fortress was destroyed. The police suffered five deaths. Although the number of bandit deaths has not been determined, the number is not less. The bandits had ample firearms and ammunition, and their numbers exceeded those of the police. The military police on the entire island of Mindanao were mobilized. The fortress has not been captured for some time. Some have suggested using bombs to bomb the fortress, but even bombs cannot penetrate it. After this complete victory, it is hoped that the Moro bandits who engage in private smuggling will disappear. According to Governor Huffington, this fierce fighting was limited to a local area, and the entire province of Lana is safe and stable. - Messfield</p>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>A telegram from a member of the Ministry of Education addressed to all newspaper publishers nationwide, to be forwarded to fellow countrymen: Upon reading the report in the newspaper of the 8th of this month that Korean independence party leaders Shin Kwang-jeong and Choi Seok-young, along with eight others, were arrested in Ping and are currently detained in the Beiping Public Security Bureau, and that the Japanese embassy has requested the authorities for extradition to the Japanese side, I have the following to say: the Koreans are of the same race as us and have already experienced the sorrow of national subjugation. The Koreans have endured this pain for more than twenty years. Recently, patriotic individuals have been appealing and striving for independence. This is also a matter that should exist in the trend of national self-determination. Japanese imperialism is carrying out massacres against members of the Korean independence party, causing patriots from that country to flee overseas and seek refuge in our country. We should express our utmost sympathy for the great cause of small and weak nations. Furthermore, according to international practice, political prisoners are protected by the laws of other independent countries. Our authorities should not detain them. The Japanese side's request for extradition is even more unreasonable. Beiping should resolutely reject this request. If, unfortunately, Shin, Choi, and others are arrested and extradited, and from extradition to death, not only will tens of millions of Koreans lose the center of their independence movement, but our country will also repeatedly err and lose its spirit of independence. Where will the national system exist? Where will justice reside? All my compatriots who are indignant at the tyranny of Japan and have a long-standing aspiration to help the weak should rise up and strive to promote the attention of the Beiping authorities. In the past, when Dr. Sun Yat-sen was in distress in London, the Chinese minister arrested Chinese state offenders, but the entire British public opinion was still turbulent and did not allow it. How much more so in arresting those whom we extradite, doing evil for the tiger and assisting wickedness? Your esteemed newspaper is the place where public opinion rests and the guide for the people. Please give your utmost publicity to this major event so that the Beiping authorities will know what to fear. Korea is fortunate, and the Chinese nation is fortunate. Li Lanchang, Qian Ruisheng, Ding Qiheng, Zhong Yingqiu, Wang Chengpin, Han He, Gu Chuiying, He Yingjie, Zhou Hu, Liu Kai, Zhong Fangzu, Ze Xiong, Zhengli Mei, Yifan Wang, Weixin Zhong, Shuyu Guo, Lianfeng Ye, Yuying Wang, Weiying Zhou, Liwang Xu, Zishi Peng, Baichuan Wu, Yan Yin and others kowtow to you.</p>

<h3>Military News from Xuyu</h3>
<p>The Entire Front Line Has Not Yet Had Formal Contact; Sun Dianying's Representative Transmits His Submission; Business Circles in Henan Telegraph, Requesting That Bombs Not Be Dropped</p>
<p>Xuzhou Fast News The military situation between Xuzhou and Henan after the retreat of the enemy army is that the entire line has not yet had any formal contact. The enemy's main force on the Longhai Line is currently the Jin Army, consisting of the three divisions of Sun Chu, Zhang Huizhao, and Guan Fu'an, who have crossed the river via Xinxiang, Fengqiu, and Chenqiao and arrived at Lanfeng, where they have established heavy defenses east of Lanfeng. Wan Xuancai, Sun Dianying, and Shi Yousan's three units are still stationed at Guide, Haozhou, and Kaocheng in their original defenses. Feng's troops are still gathered in the area of Zhongmu, Zhengzhou, Cong County, and Luoyang, and have not yet moved east. After meeting in Xinxiang, Yan and Feng went to Zhengzhou to inspect the army. Yan then returned north, while Feng remained in Zhengzhou to oversee matters related to the Longhai Line, with Sun Chu as the commander of the central route and Shi Yousan and Sun Dianying as the commanders of the left and right wings, respectively. However, neither Shi nor Sun are able to exert effort for Yan and Feng. The General Headquarters of the Second Army Corps announced yesterday that Sun Dianying had indeed submitted to the Central Government. The first step was to withdraw from Guide, and the second step would be to counterattack Kaifeng. Wan Shi can also take the same attitude as Sun. Based on this, the situation in Henan is about to change drastically, and the Central Army has also long been fully prepared. The division commanders have all gone west to inspect the defenses. The Deputy Director of Aviation, Huang Bingheng, arrived in Xuzhou by plane from Beijing yesterday and is also flying west to inspect the front line, which will unfold in the most solid manner in Congzhong.</p>
<p>Regarding Sun Dianying's submission to the Central Government, after the General Headquarters announced this yesterday, a certain Mr. Sun's official plenipotentiary representative arrived at Nansuzhou from Haozhou by car on the evening of the 7th, then transferred to a train to Xuzhou, and stayed at the Garden Hotel. He has already contacted Commander Liu and is working diligently. This reporter interviewed him at the Garden Hotel, and the representative talked about Sun's troops being gathered in the area of Haozhou, Luyi, Zhecheng, Guide, and Ningling, where Henan and Anhui provinces meet. A month ago, there was a conflict with Han's troops due to a misunderstanding, and they were attacked by the Central Army, resulting in a slight estrangement. In fact, Sun is definitely not able to exert effort for Yan and Feng. A month ago, Sun personally went to Zhengzhou and Luoyang on a trip. The disaster situation in western Henan was extremely tragic. After returning to Haozhou, he decided to submit to the Central Government. I was ordered to come to Xuzhou with two key points: (1) Sun will unite the troops of Wan Xuancai, Shi Yousan, Liu Guitang, Ren Yingqi, Wang Zhen, etc. to submit to the Central Government; (2) In Henan, he will firmly not fight for Yan and Feng, in order to shrink the military and resolve the situation in Henan. This approach is within the realm of possibility. After I request instructions, I will soon return to Haozhou to report and proceed with everything.</p>
<p>Regarding the Central Government's planes dropping bombs in Zhengzhou, the Kaifeng side sent a telegram to Liu Zhi, stating roughly: "Our Henan has unfortunately suffered from natural disasters and banditry for years, and the people are impoverished. Now, during the military period, we dare not meddle in strategy. However, in recent days, planes have come in succession and dropped bombs. Kaifeng and Zhengzhou are prosperous areas. At the repeated request of the people, we dare to send a telegram to earnestly request that the front line be telegraphed to avoid sending planes to drop bombs in order to calm the people and respect human lives." The signees are the entire committee of the Henan Provincial Commercial Federation, the Kaifeng General Chamber of Commerce, and the Zhengzhou Chamber of Commerce. Commander Liu replied by telegram, saying: "The Henan Provincial Commercial Federation, the General Chamber of Commerce, and the Zhengzhou Chamber of Commerce in Kaifeng are all acknowledged to have received the telegram. I have carefully read and considered it. Henan Province has suffered from natural disasters and banditry for years, and the suffering of the people is extremely pitiful. The Central Government, for the sake of saving the people of Henan, destroyed Feng's troops last year and quelled the rebellion of Tang, hoping that the disaster of war would be eliminated from then on and the people could rest. Unexpectedly, Yan and Feng rebelled suddenly at the time of national unification, dispatching troops to gather in Henan Province to resist the Central Government and ravage the local area. Who is the culprit? The fault lies with Yan and Feng. Our Central Government, for the sake of ensuring peace and unification, had no choice but to reluctantly send troops. If the people of Henan long for peace, I hope that they will unite with the commercial people to demand that the Yan and Feng troops withdraw from Henan within a certain period of time. Our Central Army, for the sake of considering the lives of the entire people, will no longer send planes to carry out bombings. If the rebel troops occupy Bian and Zheng, our army, for the sake of eliminating the rebel enemy, will not be able to avoid launching a fierce attack. As for the small number of planes sent by our army to Bian and Zheng, it is unavoidable that there will be accidental injuries. It is unavoidable. Having received your earnest request, I have instructed the numerous large planes that will be dispatched in succession to be sure to identify the targets before dropping bombs in order to avoid accidental injuries. This is a special reply. I hope you will be clear about it. Liu Zhi bows and seals (8th day)."</p>
<h3>Guixi Campaign After Chen Jitang Returned to Wu</h3>
<p>Jiang Guangnai Appointed Frontline Commander; Yunnan Army Dispatches Three Divisions to Enter Guizhou</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence The commander-in-chief of the Eighth Route, Chen Jitang, returned to Wu from Guangzhou yesterday (3rd). The various frontline generals immediately returned to Wu to request instructions on the offensive strategy. It was heard that Chen went to Liu Chen again during the day (Liu Chen is more than seventy li from Danzhu, located between Pingnan and Xingye) to discuss with the commander-in-chief of the Sixth Route, Zhu Shaoliang, to decide on the overall attack on Xun Gui plan. According to the rear office of Xu Kexiang's brigade of the Sixth Route Army, they received a telegram from the front line stating roughly that the Sixth Route Army is scheduled to order an attack on Xun on the 5th of this day. As for the Eighth Route Army, it was heard that it would advance from Xingye to Guixian. Chen Jitang specially appointed Jiang Guangnai, commander of the Sixty-first Division, as the frontline commander, and all the Eighth Route Army in Yulin and Xingye were placed under Jiang's command. The Sixty-second Division of Xiang Hanping will attack Hengxian Yongchun. Recently, the Guizhou army has set up defensive works between Hengxian and Yongchun to protect the traffic between Nanning and Guixian. Therefore, the Eighth Route Army will send a portion of its forces diagonally out of Hengyong to cut off the connection with the Guizhou army. As for the Sixth-second Division of Li Yangjing and the two brigades of Li Deyi and Gong Shouyi of Lu Huanyan, Deputy Commander of the Eighth Route, they will cooperate with the Sixth Route Army to attack Guiping. In addition, the Tenth Route Army of Long Yun of Yunnan Province dispatched three divisions to advance to the Guizhou border, namely the Ninety-eighth Division of Lu Han, the One Hundred Fortieth Division of Zhu Xu, and the One Hundred First Division of Zhang Chong. Lu's division will serve as the central route, while Zhu and Zhang's divisions will serve as the left and right wings, respectively, with Lu as the commander-in-chief. The military pay will be allocated by the Central Government and will encircle Yongliu together with the Sixth and Eighth Route Armies. Therefore, the war situation in Guizhou Province has turned tense again (5th).</p>
<h3>Northeast Garrison in Luanzhou</h3>
<p>A Military Road Will Be Built Between Liaoning and Rehe</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence Since the changes in the northern situation, the Northeast has dispatched troops to guard Luanzhou. Recently, Commander Zhang Xueliang telegraphed to summon the Luanzhou garrison commanders Yu Xuezhong, Brigade Commander Zhang Jiuqing, and Gao Guozhu to Shenyang to receive instructions on garrisoning methods. Mr. Yu, considering the importance of the area, requested permission to add the Fourth Brigade Commander Liu Yifei as the deputy commander of the Luanzhou garrison and returned to Luanzhou on the 2nd to arrange everything. Commander Zhang, fearing that the Jin army would invade Gubeikou or Xifengkou, in addition to ordering Rehe Commander Tang Yulin to guard, also dispatched one brigade of the Northeast Cavalry First Division under Zheng Zesheng to Qian'an Northwest, guarding Zunhua along the Luan River. A temporary military affairs office was set up in Luanzhou for the Luanzhou garrison to facilitate the transmission of military news. Currently, in order to facilitate military transportation between Tang Yulin and Shenyang, he and Zang Shiyi have agreed to build a military road between Liaoning and Rehe immediately. The construction cost is 50,000 yuan, with Liaoning Province bearing 30,000 yuan and Rehe Province bearing 20,000 yuan. Construction can begin in mid-month (5th).</p>
<h3>Peng Dehuai Captures Pingjiang County Seat</h3>
<p>He Jian Orders Tao Guang to Lead Troops to Suppress</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Bandit Chief Peng Dehuai, leading several thousand followers, has been causing disturbances in the areas of Lianhua, Yongxin, Wanzai, Ninggang, Xiushui, Pingxiang, and Tonggu in Jiangxi Province, and Pingjiang, Liuyang, Chaling, Youxian, Guidong, and Dengxian in Hunan Province for nearly two years. Although the two provinces of Hunan and Jiangxi have repeatedly dispatched large armies to jointly suppress them, they have not been eliminated, and their strength has become increasingly rampant. In late April, they again fled from Tonggu and Wanzai to Pingjiang and Liuyang, joining bandit chiefs Li Can from Tongcheng in Hubei Province and Li Shi and Kong Hezhong from Pingjiang and Liuyang in Hunan Province, intending to cause disturbances in eastern Hunan. Upon receiving the report, He Jian immediately appointed Zhang Qixiong, the Brigade Commander of the 43rd Brigade of the 15th Division, as the Commander-in-Chief for Bandit Suppression in Eastern Hunan, leading his two regiments and the independent 5th Brigade under Yan Zhongru and the Wan Fangzhi Militia to Liuyang for a vigorous suppression. When Zhang's troops arrived in Liuyang, Peng's bandits were besieging Liuyang, and the city was in imminent danger. Fortunately, the large army arrived quickly, and the bandits immediately lifted the siege and fled towards Pingjiang. The garrison in Pingjiang consisted of only one regiment, the 90th Regiment of the 45th Brigade of the 15th Division, under Yu Xianli. Initially, they were responsible for guarding the main road between Pingjiang and Liuyang to block the bandits. However, due to the support of bandit chief Li Can from Tongcheng and bandit chief Li Bao from Pingjiang, the bandit atmosphere in various villages of Pingjiang became extremely intense. Regiment Commander Yu then abandoned the Changshou area and retreated to Pingjiang County, while telegraphing He Jian, Wang Dongyuan, and others, requesting reinforcements for safety. Peng's bandits then occupied the Changshou Street area on April 27, and their power became even more rampant. He Jian then telegraphed Zhang Qixiong, ordering him to follow and suppress the bandits from Liuyang towards Pingjiang. At the same time, he telegraphed the Yang Zhenpu Regiment, stationed in the Nanhua area, ordering them to quickly return to Yuezhou to reinforce Pingjiang. He also ordered the Changsha County Militia to quickly dispatch three teams to Pingjiang to assist in the suppression. It has been over a week, and except for the first, fifth, and sixth teams dispatched by the Changsha County Militia, which have arrived in Pingjiang, the troops from Liuyang and Nanhua have not yet arrived in Pingjiang because the bandits in their local areas have not been eliminated. Regiment Commander Yu then requested the Changsha County Militia to guard the Pingjiang County seat on their behalf, while he led his troops to garrison outside the city to defend the strategic points, confronting Peng's bandits for several days without any fierce battles. Until May 5, Peng's bandits gathered all their bandit forces,</p>
<p>claiming to be ten thousand strong, and launched a five-pronged attack on the city. Regiment Commander Yu and the Changsha County Militia were outnumbered and surrounded. After two days of fierce fighting, on the afternoon of May 6, Regiment Commander Yu led his troops out and retreated towards Wukou. The Changsha County Militia, which was defending Pingjiang County, suffered a complete defeat of the first team, with the death of team leader Peng Shuchen and others. The remaining fifth and sixth teams rushed to Jinjing, the border between Pingjiang and Changsha. Pingjiang County Magistrate Song Shoumei, who was attending an administrative meeting, and the section chiefs of the provincial and county governments, along with four to five thousand refugees, fled to Xiangyin and Miluo, telegraphing the province for help. Pingjiang County was completely occupied by Peng's bandits at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of May 6. Pingjiang is only a hundred or so li from both Changsha and Yuezhou, and can be reached in two days by land. With the fall of Pingjiang, Changsha and Yuezhou are in danger. He Jian then appointed Tao Guang, the commander of the newly organized 31st Division, as the Director of the Pingjiang-Liuyang Pacification Office, ordering him to quickly lead his troops, together with Zhang Qixiong and Wang Dongyuan's brigades, to vigorously suppress the bandits. At the same time, he ordered Wei Suzhong, the Changsha Garrison Commander, to increase troops to Jinjing to prevent them from approaching the province. The provincial capital began special martial law on the 7th. The following is a record of two telegrams regarding the loss of Pingjiang:</p>
<p>Telegram from the Changsha County Magistrate (1) According to the report from Peng Yuejia, the team leader of the 6th Team of my office, who escaped from Pingjiang to Jinjing by telephone, my team was ordered by Regiment Commander Yu to defend Pingjiang County. Yesterday, on the 6th, at 1:00 PM, the bandits launched a fierce attack on my team. Peng Shuchen, the team leader of the first team, Wu Guoxiong, the squad leader, and Wu Shouji, the acting platoon leader of my team, were all killed in action. Pingjiang County was captured at 5:00 PM. (2) The entire first team was annihilated. My team escaped with ten rifles and about sixty unarmed soldiers. (3) Huang Degang and Wu Xielan, the platoon leaders of the first and second platoons of my team, and Tan Fusheng, the acting platoon leader of the first team, are all missing. Only Yi Xing and Liu Kuifa, the platoon leaders of the second and third platoons of the first team, escaped back to Jinjing with me. (4) Regiment Commander Yu's troops retreated from the Wukou area and also suffered losses, etc. Wang Zhengshi, County Magistrate of Changsha, respectfully reports, Yu Hai seal.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Pingjiang County Section Chiefs: Our county was attacked and captured by bandits at Xu hour on the fish day. The bandits have also advanced to the Wukou area. Regiment Commander Yu is currently collecting his troops and militia in Wushi and Xinshi, awaiting orders. We have taken the seal and fled to Boluo to collect the refugees. Please forgive us for leaving our posts without permission and punish us. Respectfully submitted by Zhang Mingda and Zhao Zifen, the first and second section chiefs of the Pingjiang County Government, Yu Xu seal.</p>
<h3>Government Troops Encircle Bandit Gang in Jinshuo Town</h3>
<p>Jinshuo Town, located at the intersection of Siyang in Jiangsu Province and Sixian in Anhui Province, was attacked and captured by over a thousand bandits a few days ago. They burned, killed, raped, and looted, causing unspeakable suffering to the people. The bandits took advantage of the town's high and thick walls and deep moats to occupy it. Zhang Peng, the magistrate of Siyang County, and Cui, the magistrate of Suqian County, jointly led police squads and defense corps to attack, but failed. They telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting the dispatch of artillery to suppress the bandits. Upon receiving the telegram, the Jiangsu Provincial Government immediately ordered the 266th Regiment of the 233rd Brigade, currently stationed in Gaoyou, to rush to the area to suppress the bandits. A company of artillery from the provincial police brigade accompanied the regiment. Regiment Commander Huang Meixing, upon receiving the order, led his troops to Siyang in six days and arrived at Jinshuo Town on the seventh. The police squads and defense corps of Suqian and Siyang counties also rushed to the scene. At dawn on the eighth, they encircled and attacked Jinshuo Town. The government troops fought bravely</p>
<p>and exceptionally. However, a heavy rain fell, making the roads muddy. The bandits relied on the trenches and stubbornly resisted. It was difficult for the government troops to break through, so they changed their strategy and focused on encirclement, waiting for the rain to stop before launching another attack. Regiment Commander Huang and the magistrates of Suqian and Sixian telegraphed the province to report on the encirclement. Li Mingyang, the director of the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Security Department, upon receiving the report, telegraphed Regiment Commander Huang and the magistrates of Siyang and Suqian in Jiangsu and Sixian in Anhui, ordering them to track down and pursue the bandit gang in Jinshuo Town after they were scattered, regardless of provincial or county boundaries, in order to completely eliminate them. It is estimated that the bandits will be eliminated in a few days.</p>
<h3>China Labor Bureau to be Established</h3>
<p>Chen Zongcheng Returns to China on a Mission, Labor Bureau to be Established in Shanghai or Guangzhou</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the European War, various countries held a peace conference in Geneva and signed a peace treaty. In addition to stipulating articles on disarmament and the abolition of warships, Chapter 13 also included international labor issues, hoping to solve the world's labor problems and improve the environment through peaceful means, and eliminate all disputes between labor and capital. It was decided to organize the International Labor Bureau in Geneva to handle everything. At that time, 55 countries joined the organization and held a general assembly once a year. China is one of the members and can send four representatives to participate in the meeting. The central government sends two representatives, and the Chinese labor and capital representatives each send one representative. After the general assembly last year, Thomas, the director of the International Labor Bureau, once visited China and contacted the authorities in Guangdong, Nanjing, and Wuhan, and proceeded to set up a branch in China. When Thomas came to China, he was accompanied by Chen Zongcheng, the secretary of the bureau. After Thomas returned to the West, he felt that the labor conditions in various countries were different and the circumstances were different. It was urgent to establish branches in various countries to be responsible for investigating the labor conditions of each country, so that materials could be collected and compared when the next meeting was held, and proposals could be drafted and submitted to the general assembly for discussion. Therefore, seven branches were established in various countries around the world. Thomas's investigation of Chinese labor last year concluded that there was an urgent need to establish a branch, and he had agreed with the International Labor Bureau to send personnel to China to organize it. Chen Zongcheng, the secretary who came to the East with Thomas last time, was entrusted with this mission to return to China. Chen, an engineer, recently arrived in Guangzhou and reported his mission to the provincial government authorities. Chen told people that the purpose of his return to China was to organize the eighth branch of the labor bureau. The main points are: (1) The Labor Bureau is not a group that leads workers, nor is it entirely organized by labor elements. It is composed of representatives from 55 countries, with representatives from both labor and capital participating. The bureau is in a third-party position, dedicated to studying labor issues. (2) The International Labor Bureau is not affiliated with the International League, but an independent agency. The International League studies politics, and the Labor Bureau studies social issues. (3) The International Labor Bureau is not a legislative body with supreme authority, but only studies the labor news and materials of various countries and formulates draft labor conventions, which are contributed to the governments of various countries for promulgation and implementation. There are currently 26 types of draft conventions that have been completed, and there are 20 countries that have implemented regulations on the eight-hour work system, prohibition of child labor, and labor unemployment. It is also heard that Chen believes that the branches in various countries such as Britain, the United States, Japan, France, Italy, Germany, and India have been established one after another.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The eighth branch in China should be carried out as soon as possible. Chen will report to the central government in Shanghai and Beijing after contacting the Guangdong authorities. The location of the bureau in the future still needs to be considered, but it should be chosen within the scope of Shanghai and Guangzhou. The position of director of the eighth branch will be determined by the International Labor Bureau and Chen Zongcheng will be in charge. (May 4)</p>
<h3>Famine Symptoms Already Seen in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>Officials, Merchants, and Charitable Organizations Establish a Price Stabilization Committee, Raising 400,000 Yuan for the First Phase of Price Stabilization</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The reasons for the recent high price of rice in Guangdong Province have been detailed in previous reports in this newspaper. It has been found that since the beginning of summer, the price of rice in Guangdong Province has continued to soar. The rice-producing areas are now showing signs of scarcity. Areas such as Zhongshan, Shunde, Dongguan, Yingde, and Huizhou, which produce rice, have successively banned the export of rice, which can only maintain the situation for a while. They still have to rely on a large amount of imported rice to supply the needs. As for the areas in the country that usually export rice, such as Wuzhou in Guangxi and Zhenjiang and Wuhu in the Yangtze River area, they have also banned the export of rice. At the same time, the import of foreign rice from Annam and Siam is also scarce. The main reason is the financial inflation, heavy tax rates, and the sudden increase in the exchange rate of Hong Kong dollars, so the cost of transporting foreign rice to Guangdong has suddenly increased significantly. According to recent investigations of rice prices in various regions, in Huizhou in eastern Guangdong, only four to five sheng of rice can be purchased per yuan. In Shaoguan in northern Guangdong, seven and a half jin of rice can be purchased per yuan. In Foshan in western Guangdong, only six and a half jin of rice can be purchased per yuan. In Guangzhou, only six to seven jin of rice can be purchased per yuan. According to yesterday's investigation, the current rice reserves in various regions are as follows: About 6 million jin in Wuzhou and about 90,000 bags in Guangzhou, according to the investigation of rice shops on the 29th. On the 28th, five Siamese rice ships arrived, carrying a total of 80,000 bags of rice. There are still thirteen rice ships on the way, carrying about 180,000 bags. Once these rice stones arrive in Guangdong, the rice shortage in Guangzhou may be slightly relieved. However, although the price of rice has not risen further in recent days, it has not fallen either. The authorities, seeing this, convened a special temporary meeting of the Guangdong Relief Association on the 28th, chaired by Xu Chongqing. The results of the meeting were: (1) Jointly organize a price stabilization committee with charitable and commercial organizations. (2) The amount of money is set at one million yuan, divided into two phases for price stabilization. The first phase is 400,000 yuan, and the second phase is 600,000 yuan. The first phase will be carried out first, and if the price of rice is still not stable, the second phase will be carried out. (3) Fundraising method: the Relief Association will be responsible for two-fourths of the amount, and the rest will be raised by the Chamber of Commerce and charitable organizations. (4) The Relief Association will be responsible for 200,000 yuan in the first phase and will submit it to the Finance Department for allocation under the deposit account of the association. After the establishment of the price stabilization association, telegrams will be sent to overseas Chinese to raise large sums of money. (5) Submit to the provincial government to telegraph the Wuzhou Eighth Route Army Headquarters to release rice and transport it to Guangdong. After the above methods were decided, preparations were made separately for price stabilization. On the afternoon of April 30, at 3:00 PM, representatives from the charitable and commercial communities held a meeting in the reception room of the Civil Affairs Department to prepare for price stabilization, chaired by Xu Chongqing. Representatives from the charitable community included the Fangbian Hospital, Chongzheng Charitable Hall, Pushan Charitable Hall, Zuile Hall, Huixing Charitable Hall, Aiyu Charitable Hall, Yongchang Charitable Hall, Si Miao Charitable Hall, Zhide Hospital, Relief Association, Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, General Chamber of Commerce, Commercial Federation, and Municipal Chamber of Commerce, totaling 38 people. Xu Chongqing announced the reasons for the meeting, saying that the current high price of rice has a great impact on people's livelihood, so he specially invited representatives from all walks of life to come and discuss ways to provide relief. Next, the representatives spoke one after another, discussing the methods of relieving the people's food. After a moment of discussion, Xu Chongqing proposed the organizational law of the price stabilization association and amended it for passage. Next, according to the organizational law, the results of the discussion were: (1) Representatives from all walks of life should be elected to form the price stabilization committee before May 4. (2) The price stabilization association will be held on May 5. (3) Representatives from the charitable and commercial communities will first hold a joint meeting on the 4th to discuss all matters in advance. The organizational outline of the Guangdong Provincial Price Stabilization Committee is recorded below: (Article 1) The Guangdong Provincial Relief Association, in conjunction with the provincial and municipal chambers of commerce, charitable halls, rice bran industry associations, and rice merchants' associations, will organize the Guangdong Provincial Price Stabilization Committee to save the people's food. Therefore, it is named the Guangdong Provincial Price Stabilization Committee. (Article 2) The association will have 15 committee members, with the 7 committee members of the Guangdong Provincial Relief Association as ex officio members. One representative from the New Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation, two representatives from the General Chamber of Commerce, one representative from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, two representatives from charitable halls, and one representative each from the rice merchant association and the rice bran industry will be committee members. The chairman of the Relief Association will be the chairman of the association. (Article 3) The staff of the association will be filled by the various groups of the Relief Association and will not be set up separately. If the provincial funding is insufficient, temporary staff may be added. The temporary staff added above may be given subsidies and food by the association. (Article 4) The meetings of the association are divided into standing committee meetings and temporary meetings. Standing committee meetings will be held once a week, and temporary meetings will be determined at any time. Both will be convened by the chairman. All staff may attend the above temporary meetings. (Article 5) All funds of the association will be raised by the following methods: (A) Guangdong Relief Association will share a certain amount. (B) Chambers of commerce and charitable halls will share the fundraising. (C) Donations from all walks of life in the province and other fundraising methods. (Article 6) The association is specially set up to provide relief for the current people's food and to handle price stabilization matters. All funds will be stored in special accounts and will not be mixed with the Relief Association to clarify the accounts. When the handling is completed, the income and expenditure numbers will be published in the Credit Record and sent to all walks of life to show credibility. (Article 7) The association will handle price stabilization matters until the price of rice is stabilized. (Article 8) The office of the association is located in the Guangdong Provincial Relief Association on Yide Road, Guangzhou. (Article 9) The detailed rules for the association's office will be determined separately. (Article 10) If there are any matters not covered in this outline, they will be decided and revised by the association's meeting.</p>
<h3>Wuhu Quick News</h3>
<p>According to a confidential report, the Wuhu Military and Police Joint Investigation Office arrested Chen Yufu and eight others at the Dongji Grand Hotel last night. They seized a commission from the sixth route of the National Salvation Army, along with a lot of evidence, confessing to being solely responsible for collecting scattered soldiers, etc. It is now reported that they are secretly gathering in areas such as the canal transportation team. The Investigation Office has also sent investigators to investigate and verify that Chen and others have been escorted to the Garrison Regiment for custody and verification. This morning, two more people were found in the hotel, and a pistol was also found. The remaining key figures are still being secretly arrested.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, more than 30 bandits with complete firearms suddenly arrived in Buguan Town, Hanshan County. They first claimed to be borrowing travel expenses, and then looted wildly, shooting and killing an old counter clerk in a certain workshop. No shops were spared from looting for several hours, and even cloth and other goods were looted. Before leaving, they also pulled laborers to carry the goods. County Magistrate Liu Qianyi has telegraphed the province to report the incident.</p>
<p>Provincial news: Provincial Government Chairman Ma Fuxiang has scheduled to depart from the province on the 10th to attend the Mongolian-Tibetan Conference to be held in Beijing on the 12th.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Wu Xingzhou, chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce, together with the section chief of the Municipal Administration Office, persuaded various merchants to donate funds for the relief院 (orphanage/poorhouse). Unexpectedly, the manager of Fuyuanchang and other merchants scolded Wu and others, pointing out that the beggars were still conspicuous after the establishment of the relief院 for several months, and that there was no achievement at all, accusing them of enriching themselves by using public office. Wu and others returned in anger and decided to convene a joint meeting of party and government circles to follow the provincial order to change the relief donations into a compulsory levy. The manager and others were detained by the Public Security Bureau for insulting public officials.</p>
<p>Because Li Gengchang, the Wuhu Customs Superintendent, only sought revenue and ignored the people's lives, ordering the Tax Affairs Department to release rice for export, causing panic among the people and the price of rice to rise to 17 yuan per shi, representatives from all walks of life and the People's Food Maintenance Association jointly promoted representatives to go to the Customs Office to question Li. Seeing the indignant situation of the people, Li telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, requesting permission to withdraw the order to lift the ban on rice exports.</p>
<p>The Wuhu Price Stabilization Committee is scheduled to be established at the Municipal Administration Office tomorrow. A telegram has been sent to Shanghai to order 8,000 shi of foreign rice to be shipped to Wuhu immediately. The funds will be borrowed by the General Chamber of Commerce from the Central, China, and Jiaotong banks, each borrowing 10,000 yuan, and from the Shanghai Commercial and Anhui banks, each borrowing 5,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan from the Qianye. The four price stabilization bureaus are scheduled to start selling on the 13th, with a limit of three sheng, and eight sheng of rice can be bought for each yuan. (8th)</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>News of Tai Bao Ashu's Secret Return: Bandit Chief Tai Bao Ashu in Zhejiang Province, due to repeated suppression by the military and police, his party was defeated. In the middle of last month, he led more than 30 of his die-hard followers back to Baziqiao, looted two sampan boats, and fled to the sea. Captain Pan of the Anti-Smuggling Team dispatched a team to intercept a bandit boat and rescued six hostages. Captain Pan then copied to the coastal garrison areas last month to investigate and defend, and to investigate the whereabouts of the bandits, but found nothing. On the first of this month, Captain Pan went to Shanghai to receive his salary from the Anti-Smuggling Bureau, and then went to Suzhou to discuss defense matters with the Bandit Suppression Command. On the 5th, he returned to the Caojing camp headquarters and suddenly reported that Tai Bao Ashu, unable to gain a foothold overseas, had secretly returned to the mainland two or three days ago and landed at Jinshanzui. Upon receiving the report, Captain Pan immediately met with the county police team stationed in Shanyang to investigate and arrest at Jinshanzui and other places. According to local people, the bandits did secretly sneak ashore two or three days ago, but it is unknown where they fled. Captain Pan has been strictly investigating and found no traces of Tai Bao Ashu and his party in the coastal area, which is known to have bad people mixed in. It is said that the bandit is still holding a female ticket, and there is no trace of it. Captain Pan has secretly ordered his department to be strictly guarded and to investigate the whereabouts of the bandit.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>The Arrested Bandit Escorted Back to Songjiang for Trial: At the end of last month, the bandits Dong Dazhong, Kong Lingfu, and Wu Zhiyi, who were arrested by the military and police of this county in Huangdu, Nanxiang, Jiwang, and other places, were successively escorted to the county. Zhang Mian, the former trial officer, separately pre-trialed them. Except for Wu Zhiyi, who confessed to selling smuggled salt and helping to rob Sijing Town, the other bandits were extremely cunning and refused to admit it. Now, the Songjiang County Government has consulted and requested that all the arrested bandits be brought back for trial together. County Magistrate Chen has replied that he will approve it, and they will have to be escorted for trial soon.</p>
<p>The Issue of the Appointment of the District Commander: The position of the commander of the eighth district defense corps has been vacant for a long time. Deputy Commander Fang has submitted his resignation repeatedly, but it has not been approved. It is heard that General Commander Chen believes that the duties of the district commander are important and that it is difficult for anyone who is not popular and has rich experience to be competent, so it is not easy to announce the appointment for a while. The Rumor of Child Abduction: At 3:00 PM on the 8th, it was rumored in Anting Town that a large number of child abductors had arrived at Zhangjiajiao (3 li from the town). Villagers carried their sons and daughters and fled in empty town. Families with children studying at the school in the town went to the school to take them back, as if those who were slow would be captured in a moment. Later, it was learned that the rumor was caused by the fact that two students of a certain surname in the village escaped from school in the afternoon and hid in the wheat field. As there were three Jiangbei boats with suspicious traces anchored nearby, the suspicion arose suddenly. There is also a rumor of child abduction in Shanghai, and the 市虎 cup snake has caused a disturbance.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Court Requests the Arrest of Wu Shaowu: On the 20th of last month, Yu Jinzhou and Chen Shouzhang, soldiers of the water patrol team of the County Public Security Bureau, accompanied Wu Shaowu, the captain of the second squadron of the County Police, to the house of Wang Yongcheng, a well-known local trafficker with a crooked head, outside the Xu Gate on Tiexianglu Baoyuan Street, and extorted 1,000 yuan in foreign currency. The市 Public Security Bureau 区署 and the flying squadron arrested Yu and Chen. Bureau Chief Cao of the County Bureau interrogated them and ordered Yu and Chen to be transferred to the District Court Procuratorate for investigation, because the case was serious. Captain Wu presented a request for leave to return to his hometown after the case was revealed. Later, Bureau Chief Cao issued an order to dismiss Wu. Since the District Procuratorate accepted the case, it has repeatedly investigated Yu and Chen, requiring Wu Shaowu to be escorted to the case. However, Wu has gone far away and has not been escorted to the case. Therefore, yesterday (the 10th), a public letter was sent to the water and land public security agencies requesting a general order for all to assist in the arrest for trial.</p>
<p>Environmental Pressure Leads to Suicide by Drowning: Jiang Zishan, 55 years old, who lived at No. 43 Gushi Lane inside the 阊 Gate, used to work in silk satin. He was the manager of Huang Taiji Silk Satin Shop opened by Huang Xu in the same lane. After Huang Taiji went bankrupt last year, Jiang did current buying and made several machines at home to make a living. Recently, due to the sluggish sales of domestic silk fabrics and the accumulation of unsalable goods, the loss was quite large. Moreover, the traditional Dragon Boat Festival is approaching and there is no way to make up for it. Therefore, he developed a feeling of world-weariness and jumped into the water tank in the home's patio on the evening of the previous day (8th) to commit suicide. The next morning, his wife, Wang, got up and did not see her husband Zishan, so she asked friends outside to look for him.</p>
<p>It wasn't until about 5:00 PM that there was no news. Wang then searched the house and found it in the patio water tank at about 6:00 PM. She immediately called her cohabiting to help drag Zishan up, but he had already died. She then reported to the North District Office in charge and told the guarantor to report to the District Court to send someone to inspect. After Jiang Tongsheng, the elder brother of the deceased, requested an exemption from the inspection, he prepared a coffin and buried the body.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu, a mining merchant who founded the Cici kiln, previously surveyed Nanyang Mountain in Huguan Township, which belongs to the county, and found that the mountain has the quality of Buddha stone, magnetic soil, which can be used to manufacture tiles, etc. He then submitted an application to the Department of Agriculture and Mining for filing and permission to conduct trial mining. Now, the Department of Agriculture and Mining has specially appointed Wen Zhong, the fourth technologist, to come to Suzhou on the 9th. Yesterday (the 10th), Mr. Zhu accompanied the technicians to the mountain for investigation. Once approved and licensed, work will begin. If the quality of the produced magnetic soil is excellent, the merchant plans to organize a magnetic kiln to manufacture tiles and electrical materials.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Saving a Life Instead Leads to Drowning: Yao Rengen (25 years old), a villager in Xijing Township near Zhangjingqiao, Huaishixi, in the county, was digging river mud in the river浜 in front of the gate at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday. He accidentally lost his footing and fell into the river. Yao Jinbao, a villager, saw this and immediately went into the river to rescue him. Unexpectedly, Rengen held on tightly and Jinbao was unable to drag him. The two of them sank to the bottom of the river, causing them to die tragically. All the viewers felt pity.</p>
<p>The Eagerness to Organize Ancient Sites: Since taking office as the county magistrate of this county, Sun Zuji has been engaged in organizing ancient sites and building famous sites. The Shangzunxian Hall on the Second Spring of Huishan has only existed since the Tang Dynasty. Recently, County Magistrate Sun has also raised funds to restore it and asked architect Jiang Yinglin to draw drawings and estimate the cost to start construction. The foundation of the pavilion is currently being filled and will be completed within two months. Also, the earthwork for the Huishan Park Avenue has been paved. However, the Xiduan Wulijie River was originally intended to build a bridge. However, because the river water is shallow and it is a river mouth and ships cannot pass, County Magistrate Sun decided not to build a bridge and to fill the river to facilitate transportation. It is also heard that the Xianli Bridge (the main road from the Yuyu area to Wuli Lake) has been renamed Liyi Bridge by the elders of the city, such as Jiang Yuchun, Rong Desheng, and Hua Yishan. The bridge project has been started for many days, and the bridge 堍 on both sides is about to be built. After the bridge deck is completed, it can be opened to traffic.</p>
<p>The Escaped Prisoner is Brought Back to Wuxi: On the evening of March 26, seven prisoners, including Li Chengguo, Yuan Asan, Wu Xirong, Zhang Aqi, Zhang Aquan, Wang Asan, and Liu Erblind, escaped from the county prison sub-office. It is learned that Wu Zhengrong, the chief of political police of the county government, went to Shanghai by car the day before yesterday with his eyes closed to conduct a strict investigation. He then arrested the escaped robber Yuan Asan and Wu Xirong in a workshop in Pudong, 地殒. He was immediately taken to the Public Concession police station for temporary custody. Upon hearing the report, County Magistrate Sun ordered Xie Xiaodi and Wen Ziming, the political police, to take documents to Shanghai to bring the two prisoners back for strict trial. They were brought back to Wuxi for trial yesterday afternoon. It is also heard that Yuan and Wu joined forces in the winter of last year to rob several families, including the Li family in Nanshuangmiao, and shoot the person in charge. They also robbed seven ships in the Yuyu Qianzhuang. Wang Nianci, an official of the County Prison Sub-Office, was therefore blamed. Recently, the High Court ordered his dismissal and appointed Xu Zhixuan (Zhongang) to come to Wuxi to take over. Mr. Xu arrived in Wuxi by car from Suzhou yesterday and is scheduled to take over today.</p>

The Xiwai robbery case, which occurred only a little over a *li* away from the Public Security Bureau, remains unsolved. The other day (the 8th), behind the Chengjiang Bridge main street, in the Tongxing Lane of the Beiwai district, at the Yuanjue Nunnery, more than ten monks presided over a Jinghua ritual procession sending off someone's funeral. Only a young monk was left at the nunnery. At about 4 PM, two robbers suddenly entered the nunnery and committed robbery, overturning chests and cabinets, resulting in a loss of several tens of yuan. When the presiding monks learned of this, they did not report the case.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Banditry in the Eastern Countryside: Wu Zhenglin, the preparation director of the Jin Tong Bridge Defense Corps in the eastern suburbs, received a threatening letter from bandits the other day, demanding a loan of one thousand yuan. The area immediately tightened security. The home of Chen Afo, below the Zhouzhuang gate tower, was robbed the other night. Seven or eight people entered the house, threatening with guns and demanding a loan of one thousand yuan to be delivered to Jiangbei. Chen Afo could not cope. Several days ago, the Gao Cen Defense Corps had a banditry incident where bandits attempted to steal weapons, but fortunately, they were unsuccessful. At 3:00 PM the other day, the Changshou Defense Corps received a report that bandits were hiding at the home of Tao Awu in Yuanjia Village. They led a team to apprehend Tao Jingui and four or five others and reported them to the District Chief of the 14th District for handling.</p>
<p>Resolutions of the County Reorganization Committee: The County Party Department Reorganization Committee held a meeting on the 9th and passed resolutions on several important cases: (1) How should the rejected warning letter to the *Shangbao Jiansheng* (Business Gazette) be handled? (Confidential).

<p>Keeping a wife from bad habits but being kicked in the lower abdomen: Cui Xijin of Cuijia Village, Shangbaobao, married a Ma woman who had already given birth to two sons and one daughter. Xijin does not engage in proper business. The other day, his wife admonished him, arousing his anger. He brutally beat his wife, kicking her in the lower abdomen, causing her to bleed profusely and immediately die of her injuries. His father, Yu Tang, heard of this and was greatly grieved and indignant. Yesterday, he went to the city to hire someone to write a petition to the county government, requesting legal action.</p>

Shifen's wife was unable to escape and was seized by the bandits and stabbed several times. She has now died due to the severity of her injuries.</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau Reassigns Branch Heads: Yang Xiuchun, the head of the Fifth Branch of the Daoshuqiao (Guide Arbor Bridge), has been reassigned due to the continuous robbery cases in his jurisdiction and his ineffective prevention efforts.

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Punishing Officials with Unclear Accounts: The Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs stated that there are 58 counties with over 300 former magistrates or county heads, or those concurrently serving as Finance Bureau directors, who have unclear accounts in this province. The amount of public funds owed is extremely large, and they should be ordered to handle the matters clearly to clear their procedures. A method has been proposed that those who are still serving in this province will be strictly ordered to clear their accounts within a limited time. Those who are not serving in this province or whose whereabouts are unknown will be notified through public announcements to clear their accounts within a limited time. If the accounts are still unclear after the deadline, those who are serving in this province will be dismissed from their positions and strictly pursued for recovery. Those who are not serving in this province or whose whereabouts are unknown will be listed as wanted, and the Finance Department will be ordered to accurately calculate the amount of the deficit and seal their family property to offset it. This method has been approved by the committee and will be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>Soliciting Merchants to Manage Auto Business: The Jiangsu Construction Department stated that the Provincial Highway Bureau's Second Branch originally had three operating automobile lines: one from Qingjiang to Gaoyou, one from Qingjiang to Zhongxing, and one from Qingjiang to Lianshui. Now, all are open to solicit merchants to manage the auto business. Yesterday, the department issued an announcement soliciting merchants to manage.</p>
<p>Equalization of Rice Prices; Collection of Funds: The County Head of Zhenjiang, Zhang Peng, stated that rice prices are rising daily, making it difficult for the common people to maintain their livelihoods. He specially convened a meeting of gentry and merchants to discuss solutions. It was agreed to organize the equalization of rice prices to provide relief. The total amount of funds needed for rice purchase, interest, grain losses, and bureau expenses is approximately 20,000 yuan. Gentry and wealthy merchants will bear 40% of the cost, and the remaining amount will be borne by merchants. The equalization bureau has now been established in three locations, but very few households have paid the funds they pledged. Therefore, another meeting of the pledging households was convened, hoping that each household would quickly pay the funds they pledged to avoid the newly established equalization bureau from shutting down.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Directive to Arrest Outlaws and Bandits: Regarding the incident of Chen Qingyuan, the head of the anti-smuggling camp on the four banks of Huainan, engaging in a firefight with bandits in the Dongming Temple area, it is now learned that in addition to sending the wounded Team Officer Zhang to Zhenjiang for medical treatment and dispatching Investigator Tao Xuezhong and others to suppress the bandits, the Huaiyun Commissioner Zhang Jiarui has approved a directive ordering the Anti-Smuggling Bureau to notify all camps to jointly investigate and arrest the bandits.

It will be used exclusively for road repair expenses and may not be misappropriated.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Salary Demands Meeting of All Faculty and Staff: Currently, all faculty and staff in this city are holding a meeting because Director Chen has been transferred to Yangzhou but has not yet handed over affairs, and Acting Director Sun is also suffering from hemorrhoids and has not taken over. As a result, no one is in charge. The Dragon Boat Festival is approaching soon, but the salary payment has not been scheduled.

<h3>Shan</h3>
<p>County Head Shen is Ordered to Transfer: County Head Shen Guangxiong, since receiving the order to take office in Shan, has only been there for a month. Suddenly, yesterday, he received an order from the Department of Civil Affairs to exchange positions with Ye Wen, the County Head of Changshan. Therefore, County Head Shen has ordered each department to handle the closing procedures and will hand over affairs as soon as the new appointee arrives in Shan.</p>
<p>The Public Security Team Goes to the Countryside to Suppress Bandits: Yesterday, over twenty bandit boats arrived at the Li Ze Township in the county, attempting to rob. Qiu Zu reported this to the County Public Security Bureau, which immediately dispatched a team to the countryside. The bandit boats had already departed upon hearing the news. Zhang Jinghui then searched and apprehended four villagers suspected of colluding with the bandits and sent them to the County Court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>A Giant Turtle in Pan Pond is Beaten to Death: A giant turtle kept in the Pan Pond in front of the Confucius Hall in this county is rumored to be hundreds of years old. The other day, at dusk, the turtle was floating on the surface of the water and was struck to death by someone throwing a large stone. Blood filled the pond. County Magistrate Fang, fearing that it would cause an epidemic, immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to carry it outside the South Gate to a desolate area to dig a hole and bury it.</p>
<p>Two Robbery Cases: The other day (the 6th) at night, two or three local bandits, each carrying weapons, suddenly arrived at the home of Qian Longguan, a farmer in the Beitingzi Bridge area outside the North Gate. They broke down the main door and went straight inside, searching and looting all the jewelry, silver dollars, and clothing, carrying away the stolen goods. Fortunately, no one was injured. At the same time, Zhao Xiuquan, a farmer in the Twenty-second Zhuang of Jia Ping at the border of Xu, was also robbed. The number of bandits was also twenty or thirty, seemingly the same bandits who robbed Qian Longguan's home. After entering the house, the bandits tied up Zhao Xiusheng with hemp rope and brutally beat him, forcing him to reveal where the silver was hidden. As a result, all clothing and silver dollars were looted, and the field deeds, account books, and other items were set ablaze. Both victims have reported the case to the county and requested an investigation.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Relief for Famine Victims in Xingxia Qiushan: Due to years of disasters and lack of reserves in the mountain villages of Xing Tang and Xia Bridge, this year's rice price hike has made life even more difficult, leading to cases of forced extortion and destruction in various ten markets. Although relief rice has been distributed, there are concerns that it may be exploited by bandits, leading to a temporary calm, but it is difficult to sustain. Yesterday, the Kezhen District Office, village committees, and others initiated the establishment of the Xingxia Qiushan Famine Relief Association in Ke to raise large sums from various merchants to organize the sale of rice at subsidized prices to provide relief.</p>
<p>Pawn Industry Requests Delay in Implementation of New Regulations: The Shaoxing pawn industry, due to the Provincial Government's recent changes to the pawn ticket regulations, which have a detrimental impact on the future of their business, has sent representatives to the province to petition for a temporary suspension of implementation and has also sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce requesting the County Government to delay dispatching personnel for investigation until the province issues instructions.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Fire Burns Down Xinjie Yushi Dongmen: The Shen He Soy Sauce Shop on the Xinjie Yushi Dongmen (New Street Rain Market East Gate) in the city caught fire suddenly at 11:30 PM last night. The fire was very fierce. Fortunately, the water dragons (fire engines) bravely poured water to put out the fire in just a few minutes, only spreading to the Wan Shun Tai Silk Thread Shop on the left and the Wu Bao Xing Leather Trunk Shop on the left, with losses estimated at 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Bandits Who Committed Robbery and Theft Shall Be Shot First: Yesterday, the Headquarters, considering the bandits Zhang Lianhai, An Dequan, and Han Baoqing, who robbed the Yucheng Pawnshop in the Jiangqiao Lane of the West Gate of this city, had been caught with the stolen goods, telegraphed the province for instructions on how to handle the matter. The province replied, approving the execution of the bandits on the spot and the submission of the confessions. However, Commander Wang believes that the bandits are also related to the Hengda Bank robbery case and must be interrogated further before being executed.</p>
<p>Pretending to Start a Fire to Carry Out Kidnapping: At approximately 7 PM the other night, seven bandits from Sheng County arrived at the Jing Temple next to the Fengji Building in the Xiabanzijing Temple (a single-level primary school is attached to the temple) and shouted loudly that the Lou'ao Village was on fire. The temple keeper was deceived and opened the door. The bandits rushed in and tied up the temple keeper, forcing him to lead them to the home of Lou Ruiguang. At that time, the teacher had not gone to bed and came out to scold the bandits, who opened fire and seriously injured him. The temple keeper, seeing this, was terrified and accompanied the bandits to Lou Ruiguang's home. The bandits tied Lou Ruiguang's hands behind his back and forced him to go, claiming that they would prepare 1,000 yuan and go to Xinling to redeem him. Afterwards, the family members knelt down and begged, finally settling for 500 yuan on the spot. The bandits took the silver and left howling to the west. The injured teacher has been taken to the Ningbo Municipal Hospital for treatment, but his injuries are too severe and his life may be in danger.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Dispatching Troops to Dai Village to Provide Deterrence: Since the occurrence of disturbances by bandits and communists in the area of Yiqiao, which is across the river from Dai Village in the southern countryside of Xiaoshan, rumors have been rampant and people's hearts have been unsettled. Wealthy families have become increasingly alarmed. It is learned that the county government still fears that reactionary elements will take advantage of the situation to instigate unrest and that stability will be difficult to maintain. It has already consulted with the Security Team to dispatch troops to provide deterrence.</p>
<p>Allocating Troops to Protect the Cocoon Markets: Xiaoshan is a cocoon-producing area. Provincial orders have been issued regarding the allocation of troops and the escort of military police for the protection of the cocoon markets and the transportation of silver in the cocoon markets. It is learned that the Xiaoshan County Government is responsible for 70 land police officers and a portion of the First River Police Squad. When necessary, troops will be temporarily dispatched from Shao or Hang. The Provincial Police Corps will be responsible for Linpu, and the River Police will be responsible for Wenyang.</p>
<p>Appeal to Change People's Fields into Agricultural Farms: The Xiaoshan County Government has designated over 50 *mu* of people's fields below the Beigan Mountain to be changed into an agricultural experiment farm and has ordered each owner to sign a new lease contract with the farm, giving each tenant farmer a subsidy of five yuan per *mu*. It is learned that the tenant farmers, including Pan Jinfu and ten other families, have always relied on farming for a living and that having no land to cultivate at this time would be equivalent to cutting off their livelihoods. They have submitted separate petitions to the Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government, requesting the county to withdraw the order to maintain the livelihoods of the tenant farmers. It remains to be seen whether this will be approved.</p>

<h3>Chinese Track and Field Athletes Outperform Foreigners</h3>
<p>Chinese team scores 117.5 points, foreigners score 45.5 points. Six new national records in shot put, discus, high jump, triple jump, 1500 meters, and 800-meter relay. Zhao Rugong, Long Zexian, and Zhu Ruihong are selected for the Far Eastern Games.</p>
<p>Liu Changchun Injured in 100-Meter Start, Zhao Dexin Withdraws from 10,000 Meters Due to Stomach Pain, Sun Guiyun's Performance Declines Yesterday.</p>
<p>Six National Records</p>
<p>Women's Performance Average</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese and foreign track and field athletes competed against each other, and famous Chinese and Western athletes met in a match. No wonder Father Lao and the roads were crowded with carriages and horses. In the track and field stadium, only crowds of people were seen, and enthusiastic applause rose one after another, shaking the surroundings. The total number of people was about three to four thousand, which is indeed the most grand occasion for track and field competitions this year. However, the order of the venue was very chaotic. A portion of ignorant spectators rushed into the arena, making the progress of the sports competition difficult. Those in charge did not pay attention to this beforehand. The order of the audience in the entire venue was extremely chaotic, but a portion of the audience was high on the stands and was able to comply. All the results are worth seeing. New national records were set in the shot put, discus, high jump, triple jump, 1500 meters, and 800-meter relay, which is very commendable. It is regrettable that sprint star Liu Changchun injured his ankle during the 100-meter start, which prevented him from participating. The performance of the women's team was average. Sun Guiyun was at a loss, Wu Meixian won the 50-meter race, and Sun fell to fourth place in the 100-meter race. The last three were foreigners. Sun's previous performance was only a little over 10 seconds, but her performance was average afterwards, and Sun actually fell to fourth place. It is surprising that her performance has declined. Is it because she has not practiced much recently?</p>
<h3>Results of the Competition</h3>
<p>Chinese Team Scores 117.5 Points, Foreigners Score 45.5 Points</p>
<p>As a result of the competition, China won first place with 117.5 points, and the foreigners won 45.5 points. The first-place winner in the relay race received three points, and the second-place winner received zero points.</p>
<p>Three More Athletes Selected</p>
<p>Taking advantage of yesterday's Sino-foreign sports meet, the track and field scores of the athletes to be selected were reviewed by the members of the review committee, Zhuang Xiangqing and Wu Bangwei. After the selection committee made its choice, a total of three athletes, including Zhao Rugong, were selected to join the Chinese track and field team to participate in the Far Eastern Games. Zhao Rugong jumped 6.42 meters in the long jump, Long Zexian ran 10,000 meters in 36 minutes, 50 and 4/5 seconds, and Zhu Ruihong ran 400 meters in 54 seconds.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Competition</h3>
<p>100 Meters</p>
<p>The first event of the competition was the 100-meter race. Five of our athletes participated, namely Liu Changchun, Zhong Lianji, Hao Chunde, Gu Zaiping, and Zhou Zhaoyuan. The start was not uniform in both attempts, and Liu Changchun injured his foot as a result, which greatly disappointed the spectators. In the third attempt, the seven athletes sprinted shoulder to shoulder, which was very even. When reaching the finish line, the American Tang Shirey worked hard to sprint and finally won first place, about one and a half meters away from the second-place American Laurel Si. Zhong Lianji was third and Zhou Zhaoyuan was fourth. The time was 11 and 3/5 seconds.</p>
<h3>200 Meters</h3>
<p>Seven people participated in the competition. Zhou Zhaoyuan took the lead with a very fast start and remained in front throughout the race. Unfortunately, in the last 32 meters, the American Tang Shirey worked hard to catch up and won by about one step at the finish line. The time was 23 and 1/5 seconds. Liu Changchun did not participate in this race due to his foot injury, and Zhong Lianji also did not participate, reducing the interest in the race.</p>
<h3>400 Meters</h3>
<p>Only five people participated in the competition. Mai Guozhen took the lead, with the American Tang Shi Lei closely following behind. When the last 40-50 meters were reached, Tang sprinted forward, demonstrating his skill. Mai Guozhen eventually fell behind by about two yards. The result was 53 seconds.</p>
<h3>800 Meters</h3>
<p>At the starting gun, Deng Zhiming took the lead all the way, with light steps and agile body, reaching the finish line in 2 minutes and 9 and 2/5 seconds to take first place. Lang Dakui competed fiercely for second place, not far behind.</p>
<h3>10,000 Meters</h3>
<p>Jiang Yunlong did not participate, so there was one less strong athlete. China was represented by Zhao Dexin, Chen Xuzhou, and Long Zexian. After the start, the three athletes chased each other and led the way. When 19 laps were reached, Chen Dexin ran out of steam and withdrew from the race. Chen Xuzhou and Long Zexian then competed for victory. There were no outstanding Western athletes, and they all fell behind by one or two laps. As a result, Long came in first and Chen came in second. The result was 36 minutes and 50 and 4/5 seconds.</p>
<h3>1500 Meters</h3>
<p>Three Chinese athletes and five foreign athletes participated in the competition. After the command was given, Jiang Yunlong of our country took the lead. Zhao Dexin and Song Zean closely followed behind. In the third lap, the American James sprinted forward and followed Jiang. In the final turn, Zhao Dexin suddenly bravely overtook Jiang Yunlong. Jiang's skill was originally above Zhao's. About 100 meters from the finish line, Jiang suddenly sprinted out, enlarging his steps and continuing to work hard. As a result, Zhao fell behind by five or six meters. Jiang came in first, the American James came in third, and Shou Zean came in fourth. The result was 4 minutes and 23 seconds, breaking the record of 4 minutes and 24 and 3/5 seconds set by Jiang Donghua at the Northern Sports Meet last year, setting a new national record.</p>
<h3>800-Meter Relay</h3>
<p>Our country's athletes were Zhou Ende, Mai Guozhen, Zhong Lianji, and Zhou Zhaoyuan, creating a new national record of 1 minute, 53 and 1/5 seconds. The skill of the four was very good. The foreigners fell behind by thirty or forty meters.</p>
<h3>Shot Put</h3>
<p>Pan Nanshun won first place in the previous National Games, but this time Pan fell to fourth place. Lu Ming set a new national record with a result of 13.45 meters. The second and third places were both Americans.</p>
<h3>Discus Throw</h3>
<p>Zhang Lingjia was unfortunately eliminated in the National Games, but yesterday he set a new national record with a distance of 34.63 meters. The American came in second, and Zhao Wenzao came in third. The result was 29.75 meters. The fourth place was also an American.</p>
<h3>Javelin Throw</h3>
<p>Pan Nanshun set a new record of over 44 meters in the National Games, but yesterday he came in third. The first place was Wang Jihai, whose result was not very good, only 41.612 meters.</p>
<h3>Long Jump</h3>
<p>Zhao Rugong came in fourth in the long jump at the National Games, but yesterday he won first place with a distance of 6.42 meters, which was still worse than his Jiangda result. Hao Chunde came in second, and Wang Jihai and Xiao Dinghua came in next.</p>
<h3>High Jump</h3>
<p>There were many Americans in this event. Those who were not selected for our National Games also tried again, which shows that there are many talents. Li Zhongshen set a new national record with a height of 1.797 meters (5 feet 10.5 inches). He Tong came in second, and his result was also good at 5 feet 8 inches. Fu Baorui came in third at 5 feet 7 inches. Li Lin and the American Weirwei tied for fourth place at 5 feet 5 inches.</p>
<p>High Jump First Place Li Zhongshen</p>
<p>(Wang Kai Photo)</p>
<h3>Triple Jump</h3>
<p>Situ Guang broke Situ Jun's national record of 13.2124 meters with a result of 13.72 meters. Xiao Dinghua also broke the national record with 13.55 meters. The result was very good.</p>
<h3>Pole Vault</h3>
<p>The champion was actually a Westerner, and the result was not very good, only 3.35 meters. Cao Yu rested after passing 3.26 meters due to leg pain. Otherwise, he would have won first place. Fu Chen tied for fourth place with 3.155 meters.</p>
<h3>Women's 100 Meters</h3>
<p>Our country was almost completely defeated, with only Sun Guiyun getting fourth place. The first, second, and third places were all Americans, but the results were very weak (14 seconds). With Sun Guiyun's past performance, it would have been very easy to win first place, but this time she actually fell to fourth place. It is no wonder that this is a strange thing.</p>
<h3>Women's 200-Meter Relay</h3>
<p>Our country was first and second, with Wu Meixian and Liu Jingzhen both winning. Liu Youqing was originally in the lead for the sixth position, but unexpectedly, when Sun Guiyun took the baton in the end, she was unable to coordinate, so she was overtaken by the American Van Aifer, who took first place. It was a great pity.</p>
<h3>Women's 50 Meters</h3>
<p>Wu Meixian was the leader in the women's 50 meters in our country. The eyes of the audience were focused on Sun, but they didn't know that as a result of the competition, Sun fell to second place, and Wu Meixian grabbed first place. Wu's sprint skill was very good. After the start, she took the lead in one breath, about half a meter ahead. The difference at the finish line was also very small. The fierceness of the competition can be seen here. The third place was Thomson, and the fourth place was Liu Youqing. The time was 7 and 2/5 seconds.</p>

<h3>Chinese Baseball Team Makes a Splash</h3>
<p>Yesterday Won Against the United States by a Score of 11 to 2 Today Will Face Japan in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Oh, how brave and vigorous are their bodies and skills! How superb and miraculous are their techniques! They are truly worthy of being representatives of our Chinese baseball team! Such sounds of praise and appreciation came from the enthusiastic audience. When the reporter left Yang after the Sino-American baseball game yesterday, the entire atmosphere was almost filled with such voices. Therefore, it is perhaps not difficult for the Chinese expatriates from Honolulu, representing China, to raise their eyebrows and exhale at this Far Eastern Games. Yesterday's overwhelming defeat of the United States by a score of 11 to 2 was just a small test of their skills.</p>
<h3>(1) Fighting Japan This Afternoon</h3>
<p>This afternoon at 3:00 PM, the team will face the Japanese baseball team. The Japanese baseball team has a good reputation in Yay, and their talents and strength are by no means ordinary. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese teams today must engage in a fierce competition to determine the winner.</p>
<h3>(2) A Full House of Spectators Appreciates Ball Skills</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the first time the Chinese team showed their skills. Almost all the seats were filled with those who came to watch the performance. From beginning to end, they witnessed the Chinese team's unified spirit and superb skills, which made the American team, represented by McKinley, unable to do anything and unable to cross the Lei Pool. Therefore, they danced, cheered, and clapped their hands as if they were mad, and the expression of their faces could not be described in writing in even one ten-thousandth.</p>
<h3>(III) Neatly Aligned Formation Called Elite Troops</h3>
<p>The Chinese team's talent and neat formation were far superior to the previous competition, making the name "elite troops" truly deserved. The pitcher's iron arm had extreme variety, and coupled with the agile catcher, they formed a perfect combination. The infield positions were appropriate and the connections were well-organized. The outfield was quick to seize opportunities and handle situations effectively. Moreover, everyone was good at hitting. Therefore, it was not surprising that they greatly defeated the United States. Taking the pitcher as an example, Chinese pitcher Zhong You's pitches could curve up and down at will, so there were ultimately no walks given. He never gave anyone a chance to walk. Of the two American pitchers, the one who pitched one and a half innings was Belis, followed by Welch. Compared to the two, the latter was better, as the former had four balls while the latter had only two. At the same time, Chinese pitcher Zhong You had four strikeouts, while American pitcher Welch only had two. All of these things show that Chinese pitcher Zhong You's skills were clearly one level above others.</p>
<h3>(IV) Effortlessly Gained Three Points</h3>
<p>The first batter for the Chinese team, Zhang Rong'an, walked to first base. Then, due to an error by the American shortstop, Zhang advanced to second base. The second batter, Feng Yuhe, occupied first base. The third, Lu Shujie, was caught out. The fourth, Cai Yunping, also gained a base without effort, and Feng also moved up. At this time, the Chinese athletes fully occupied all three bases, a moment of great danger. The fifth, Lin Yan, also hit the ball quite well and occupied first base, but Zhang Rong'an was too slow returning to home base and was tagged out. However, with someone on third base, the situation remained tense. The sixth, Li Li, was hit by the pitcher and awarded first base, and everyone moved forward. Feng Yuhe then safely walked home, scoring the first point for the Chinese team that day. The seventh, Yu Xiansan, was caught by the pitcher, and the entire team retreated. The United States then switched from defense to offense, but unexpectedly, the first three batters were all put out, and the Chinese team then began their second offensive. Initially, Yang Jianzhao and Zhong You both reached base due to ball counts. Then, Feng Yuhe and Lu Shujie each had a hit, advancing to fourth base one after another. First Zhong then Feng. The American pitcher repeatedly miscalculated, and the situation became increasingly dangerous. They then replaced Belis with Welch to try to salvage the situation. Sure enough, shortly after, they managed to get a double play, otherwise the situation would have been unimaginable. From the second inning to the end of the third inning, both sides passed peacefully without any further surprises.</p>
<h3>(V) The Chinese Team Ramped Through Unimpeded</h3>
<p>In the fourth inning, the Chinese team made great progress. Feng Yuhe first occupied first base, and Lu Shujie hit the ball, advancing to first base. Then, another runner advanced from first base. Suddenly, Cai Yunping's double allowed Feng and Lu to both return to home base. Lin Yan then had another hit, and Cai also returned to home base. Following them were Lin Yan and Li Li, both benefiting from Zhong You's double. In this inning, the Chinese team scored as many as five points. American Fulmen also scored the first point for the United States, but it was partly due to Pasima's hit. In the fifth inning, Feng Yuhe was already on second base. Due to Lun's injury, Zhang Rong'an replaced him. Shortly after, Cai Yunping's hit gave Zhang Rong'an the opportunity to return to home base. Unexpectedly, the Chinese team suddenly suffered a double play, and the entire team was put out. However, the United States still showed no improvement. In this inning, the Chinese team added another point, making the score 9-1. In the sixth, seventh, and third innings, both sides' pitchers had amazing performances, either retiring halfway or not even taking the field. There was no battle to speak of. In the ninth inning, Zhong You had a hit and reached base. Shortly after, Zhang Rongsheng came on the field, and each occupied first base. Feng Yuhe worked hard and hit a long ball near the edge of the net, and Zhong and Zhang both returned, adding two more points for the Chinese team. American Pasima and Stanton both occupied bases. Pasima was exhausted, and Monts replaced him. When it came to Welch's turn to hit, Suntus substituted him. With a successful hit, Monts returned to home base. After nine innings, the game ended, and the Chinese team defeated the United States 11-2.</p>

<h3>Amateur Sports Rules</h3>
<p>(Resolution of the Amateur Sports Rules Committee of the Sports Advancement Association)</p>
<p>Please use the International Amateur Rules for the Far Eastern Games; China will separately formulate Chinese Amateur Sports Rules.</p>

The committee members present were Jiang Xiangqing (Chairman), Rong Qizhao, Ma Yuehan, Xu Zhendong, and Qiu Jixiang. The following resolutions were made: (1) The amateur rules used by the Far Eastern Games are outdated and not suitable for the current world and international games. They need to be revised. Therefore, it was resolved to request the China National Sports Advancement Association to propose that the Far Eastern Games adopt the international amateur rules. (2) If the Far Eastern Games officially adopts the international amateur rules, the China National Sports Advancement Association will then formulate Chinese amateur sports rules based on the domestic situation to make them applicable.</p>

<h3>Municipal Education Bureau and Five Universities Host Banquet</h3>
<p>Shanghai Athletes of the National Games</p>
<p>The Shanghai Education Bureau, Hujiang University, Jinan University, Jiaotong University, Chizhi University, and Daxia University hosted a banquet at the East Asia Restaurant yesterday afternoon at 6 PM for the Shanghai Special Municipality athletes who participated in the National Games. Chen Dezheng, Liu Zhanen, Liu Panzhu, and over a hundred athletes attended. The meeting was originally scheduled to begin at 4 PM, but it was delayed until 6 PM due to the sports meet between the athletes and American expatriates yesterday.</p>
<p>Chairman Chen Dezheng delivered a welcome speech, saying: Today, the five universities and the Municipal Education Bureau are hosting a banquet to welcome the Shanghai athletes who participated in the National Games. This year's Municipal Games have passed, and recalling the past, there are two points to note: (1) This year's Municipal Games were prepared in haste, but the results were still good due to talent. (2) One noteworthy point from this year's Games is that there was too little practice. Therefore, I hope that everyone will pay close attention to these two points. The Education Bureau and those who run education in this city have high hopes for you. First, I hope that each of you can become a model in the sports world, abide by discipline, and have a strong body so that everyone can pay attention to you and arouse interest in sports. Second, I hope that you will strictly abide by amateur rules during sports. Sports are a pastime for all careers and not a profession, so the three words "abide by rules" should not be neglected. Third, I hope that you understand that all the achievements are very shallow and cannot be compared with the Far East or the world. Even in the country, you cannot boast of being good. I deeply hope that you can continue to work hard and practice constantly so that next year's municipal or national games will have better results to report to us. These are the earnest expectations of the five universities and the Municipal Education Bureau for you, so I sincerely offer them to you at today's welcome banquet. I also apologize for the lack of thorough preparation for this sports meet and the inadequacy of today's hospitality and banquet, and I hope that you can forgive me. I would also like to thank all the coaches and staff for their efforts in this sports meet. Next, the chairman introduced</p>
<p>Liu Zhanen and others gave speeches. Mr. Liu briefly stated that he participated in the World Education Conference last year. On the way back, he and his companions discussed the illnesses of China. There are five: weakness, poverty, ignorance, laziness, and selfishness, and the most important is weakness. You have become sports figures. I hope you can work hard to promote it so that the people of the country can learn from your strength and know that sports should be paid attention to. This is one thing. Sports are related to morality, and this point should also be noted.</p>
<p>Next, Mr. Liu Panzhu, the representative of Jiaotong University, spoke about what the sports world should pay attention to: (1) Do not be proud; (2) Prepare more. Finally, the athlete Tao Ming responded, and the meeting ended with photos and joy.</p>

On this day, Jiang was the edge of garments messenger for the Boy Scouts, conveying news at the meeting. Those who saw him greeted him warmly, calling him "Little Chairman." Meat Leg Competition Dividing Black and White: Before the opening, a group photo of athletes and staff was taken. The female students of Soochow and Chenglie were completely bare and dressed in culottes. Their previous lantern pants had also been slightly changed. The seating arrangement at the time of the photo was very similar to a meat leg competition. Among them, Soochow's Yang Jikang's legs were the whitest, and Chenglie's Chen Linzhu's legs were the blackest, probably because one bushel of wounds had not healed during the preliminary round the day before.</p>

<h3>Director Chen Dezheng of the Municipal Bureau of Education</h3>
<p>Talks about Recovering Educational Rights in Concessions</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that since the Municipal Bureau of Education issued a declaration to reclaim educational rights in concessions, all sectors have paid close attention. Party departments and organizations at all levels have also successively risen up to express their strong support. Yesterday, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency made a special trip to visit Chen Dezheng, Director of the Bureau of Education. According to Mr. Chen's statement to the reporter, regarding the recovery of educational rights in concessions, it is naturally a necessity in reality. The current educational undertakings in concessions cannot have considerable upward development, but instead, there is a chaotic and backward phenomenon. This is solely due to the restrictions of unequal treaties, which have made it difficult for this bureau to implement its determination to rectify and its plans for improvement. Therefore, the first point of my active advocacy for the recovery of educational rights in concessions is not merely to passively eliminate the inferior private schools in the concessions. The most important point is that I cannot bear to see the citizens in the concessions being trapped by the policy of fooling the people, and I want to actively carry out some new construction in the educational undertakings in the concessions. Therefore, the main part of the bureau's predetermined plan is to "establish municipal schools as much as possible based on the needs of the citizens in the concessions." As for the elimination of inferior resident schools, this is a matter of course. The second point is that the recovery of educational rights in concessions and the rectification of church schools are completely two different things. Regarding church schools, if they are truly engaged in education and run with integrity, this bureau is very willing to support their development. There are quite a few church schools in the Nanshi and Zhabei districts now, and this bureau has never taken any action to eliminate them, and has even given them a lot of help in the form of non-mandatory support. This can prove it. As for the corrupt schools, it is the duty of this bureau to eliminate them to avoid misleading young people's studies. Whether or not to eliminate them depends on the content of the school, and it is absolutely not a question of whether it is a church or not. Mr. Chen continued to tell the reporter that recently, regarding the rectification of various universities, this bureau will wait for and follow the orders of the Ministry of Education. According to regulations, except for those explicitly permitted by the Ministry of Education, the education departments of various provinces and the education bureaus of special municipalities have no direct authority to discipline universities. In the future, I will have further opinions on this matter and will publish them separately, he said.</p>

<h3>Direct Wireless Communication</h3>
<p>Between Shanghai and the Dutch East Indies</p>

It was officially implemented on the 7th of this month. According to investigations, the average time for telegrams between Shanghai and the Dutch East Indies in the past two days has been less than twenty minutes. The excellent results are not comparable to the highest speed of other circuits (thirty-five minutes). Moreover, the price remains the same at one yuan and fifty cents per word. Therefore, Chinese and foreigners alike are full of praise, it is said.</p>

<h3>The Navy Reorganization Office Held its Closing Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Number of Committee Members Was Insufficient for a Legal Meeting; A Discussion Meeting was Held to Discuss the Office's Funding Issues, etc.</p>
<p>The affairs of the Navy Reorganization Office have been at a standstill for several months because the committee members are scattered in various places. Chairman Yang Shuzhuang returned to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday and specially convened the committee members in Shanghai and telegraphed Chen Shaokuan, Vice Minister of the Navy, to come to Shanghai to discuss the office's previous funding issues and preparations for closing. Yesterday, committee members Yang Shuzhuang, Chen Shaokuan, Zhang Qun, and Liu Fushou, etc., arrived. The Northeast committee members were not in Shanghai, and Chen Jiliang was in Fujian and Zeng Yiding was in office, so the number of committee members present was insufficient for a legal meeting. A discussion meeting was held instead, from 3 p.m. to after 5 p.m., when the meeting adjourned. A reporter from the Nihon Nichinichi Shimbun made a special visit to Mr. Yang at the office and was introduced to Mr. Yang by Vice Minister Chen Shaokuan. A brief conversation was conducted with Mr. Yang. The conversations between Mr. Yang and Mr. Chen are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Chen Shaokuan's Conversation (Reporter asked) What is the purpose of your visit to Shanghai today, Vice Minister? (Chen replied) Because the issue of the Navy Reorganization Office is about to end, I came to Shanghai yesterday at the invitation of Chairman Yang to briefly</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Eleventh Day of May, Nineteenth Year of the Republic of China (The Shanghai News, Third Edition), Sunday</p>
<p>Discuss and have important business to contact Minister Yang. (Asked) How is the situation in Fujian Province now? (Answer) The situation in Fujian Province remains the same. The Central Government has not settled the situation in Fujian because the overall situation is not peaceful. Minister Yang is still requested to return to the province to handle the matter. (Asked) When will Minister Yang return to Fujian? (Answer) Minister Yang should have returned to Fujian immediately, but his old illness has not fully recovered. He is seeking medical treatment and examining his body in Shanghai. Moreover, Fujian Province lacks good doctors. If he actively returns to the province, the voyage will inevitably be tiring, and it will be even more troublesome to return to Shanghai. Therefore, the date of his return to Fujian is still pending. (Asked) What is the itinerary of Commissioner Du in Europe? (Answer) The National Government specially dispatched Commissioner Du to Europe and the United States to inspect the navy. Now that he has completed his mission, he originally intended to return to China immediately. However, the government, in view of the immaturity of China's aviation industry, took the opportunity to order Commissioner Du to inspect the aviation affairs of various countries again while he was in Europe. Therefore, the date of his return to China is still several months away. (Asked) What other tasks do you have in Shanghai, Vice Minister, and when will you return to Beijing? (Answer) I must return to Beijing tonight (the 10th) because the Ministry of the Navy does not have so-called weekly holidays. Even on holidays, this ministry continues to work as usual. 　　Yang Shuzhuang's Conversation (Reporter asked) When will Chairman Yang return to Fujian? (Yang replied) I (Yang referred to himself) have not fully recovered from my old illness. Although I have been recuperating in Hangzhou recently, I still need to seek medical treatment and examine my body, so the date of my return to Fujian is undecided. (Asked) Is it true that Chen Peikun, the acting chairman of Fujian, will come to Shanghai? (Answer) He should arrive in Shanghai in a few days. (Asked) What is the purpose of Chen's (Peikun's) visit to Shanghai? (Answer) Probably to urge me to return to the province because the Fujian affairs have not been resolved. (Asked) How was the discussion at today's meeting on the closing of the reorganization? (Answer) The Navy Reorganization Office has been at a standstill for a long time because the committee members are not in Shanghai. This time, I specially invited the committee members to attend. Also, because the number was insufficient for a legal meeting, we changed it to a discussion meeting to discuss the office's funding issues. (Asked) Will the reorganization office be closed today? (Answer) Today, we briefly discussed the closing procedures. At this point, it was getting late, so I said goodbye.</p>
<h3>Opinions of the German Chamber of Commerce on Chinese Goods</h3>
<p>Letter from the Chinese Embassy in Germany</p>
<p>Previously, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, in order to investigate German opinions on Chinese goods, sent a letter to the Chinese Embassy in Germany, requesting them to collect opinions from the Bremen and other chambers of commerce in that country. This was previously published in various newspapers. Now, the embassy has received opinions from the Berlin and Hamburg chambers of commerce regarding our country's hides, silk, and tea industries, and forwarded them to the bureau. Their remarks are particularly worthy of emulation by Chinese merchants. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Overview: The quantity and quality of Chinese export goods can no longer maintain their original state in the face of the development trends of the world market. The best-selling export goods of the past have now plummeted. If China wants to revitalize its export trade, it must pay attention to the following reforms: (1) increase production; (2) improve quality; (3) reduce value. Increasing agricultural output is most important for China. With its vast land and abundant resources, much of China's fertile land remains uncultivated. This is partly due to the weakness of public organization among the Chinese people, but mostly due to frequent domestic turmoil and incessant warfare. This is the biggest obstacle to expanding cultivation. The poor quality of Chinese export goods is due to the immorality of merchants who engage in fraudulent and deceptive practices, mixing inferior goods to increase weight. Almost all of China's most famous export goods suffer from this. For example, beans and grains are mixed with dirt and gravel, requiring cleaning before shipment, which delays transportation. Cotton is made damp. Bird feathers and pig bristles are mixed with dirt and lime. Hair fabrics contain too much foreign matter. Vegetable oil is mixed with cheap, inferior oil. Hides are made excessively damp, reducing their value. The above is partly due to the lack of morality among Chinese merchants, but other reasons lie in the underdevelopment of the economy and the imperfection of economic organization. In terms of value, the immorality and deceit of merchants have a negative impact. Moreover, the Chinese inland commercial organization requires the participation of brokers, the routes are long and insecure, and in addition to regular taxes and extraordinary taxes, there are also illegal and forced miscellaneous taxes, all of which greatly increase the value of goods. All of this can be improved through political and economic principles. If domestic politics are pacified, transportation routes are improved and added, national taxes are reduced, and illegal miscellaneous taxes are abolished, then China's export goods will undoubtedly be revitalized.</p>
<p>Silk: China was originally the world's silk exporting country, but in the last twenty years, this name has become untrue. Complacent and stagnant, Japan has increased its production tenfold in the last twenty-five years, becoming the leader of the world market. This cannot be said to be due to the degradation of Chinese silk production, but rather because the world market's demand for silk has increased dramatically, and China has failed to adapt to the trend and make timely improvements. This is the biggest reason for its failure, and the lack of external promotion and development is particularly fatal. The reasons for the lack of silkworm farming and silk production in China are: (1) silkworm diseases; (2) emphasis on outdated and primitive styles of cocoon spinning. There is no doubt about the need for improvement in silkworm farming and production in China today. China is the origin of silk, and it should not be difficult to restore its reputation as a world-leading silk exporting country in the future.</p>
<p>Tea: In recent years, the decline of the Chinese tea market has been undeniable. Tea drinkers in various countries have lost their interest in Chinese black tea. Although the number of tea drinkers in various countries is increasing, the sales of Chinese tea remain sluggish. Before the European war, 85% of German tea drinkers preferred black tea, but today only 15% do. Other countries, except Russia, are also less inclined to buy black tea, but the sales of green tea are better. The reason for this change in taste is that black tea is deteriorating, while tea planted in India and Ceylon is superior due to proper cultivation and refined manufacturing. It is also possible that Chinese tea is too conventional and does not know how to improve, so it pales in comparison. Leather: Chinese raw hides and furs have become accustomed to being of poor quality in the market. The reasons are quite complex. Chinese farmers mostly lack proper experience. The hides are not stretched to the correct size and are only air-dried. Then, brokers re-wet them two or three times. This method makes the leather hard or the fur surface dirty. In severe cases, the leather is over-stretched, completely losing the original shape of the animal. The old Chinese tanning method is very successful for most fur goods. Recently, foreign tanning methods have been widely adopted in major commercial centers. This method is not perfect, as the tanned leather is sometimes prone to evaporation and discoloration, and often cannot be thoroughly dried. In China's hot and humid summer climate, especially in Shanghai, it is difficult to dry leather goods thoroughly.</p>
<h3>Active Improvement of Cotton and Rice in the Urban Area</h3>
<p>Cooperative Experiment Zone Expanded to Six Districts and Forty-Six Locations</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau, in order to improve cotton cultivation in the urban area, last year experimentally established six cotton planting cooperative experiment zones in the Lihang District of Pudong. It allocated high-quality seeds, subsidized experiment costs, and sent personnel to provide guidance at any time. The results were very good. The output per mu was at least 100 catties and up to 170 catties, which was more than double the harvest of ordinary farmers, attracting the attention of local farmers. It is reported that the bureau will continue to hold cotton planting cooperative experiments, and at the same time improve rice cultivation. It has now expanded to six districts and forty-six locations, including thirty-nine for cotton and seven for rice. It is also reported that Chen Tianxi, a municipal affairs commissioner in the Yangsi District, will donate all the salary he earned from working at the Longji Yarn Factory to establish cotton planting cooperation in the district to promote it. All districts and locations have now been sown. The bureau first ordered municipal affairs commissioners in each district to convene a meeting, and sent personnel to attend and provide guidance. On the spot, it distributed cotton and rice cultivation procedure tables, recording tables, cultivation methods, and work diaries, etc., and instructed instructors in each district to record the progress in detail every day for assessment. The bureau will also send personnel to supervise and guide at any time, hoping to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<h3>Formal Liner Service to Open Between China and Russia</h3>
<p>Russian Merchants to Purchase New Chinese Tea</p>
<p>Since the resumption of the Vladivostok route between China and Russia last year, the Soviet Russian commercial fleet has been vigorously developing import and export trade between China and Russia. After mid-March of this year, as the northern Russian sea route thawed, the fleet prepared to expand its shipping business with China. In early April, it chartered twenty merchant ships in Shanghai for the exclusive use of transporting northern goods to Vladivostok and then distributing them to China and other places. Although the China-Russia航line has been restored for five months, a formal scheduled service has not yet been established. Now, as new Chinese tea is about to enter the market, the Soviet Russian authorities are urgently preparing to operate a formal liner service between China and Russia to facilitate transportation. The plan and opening situation are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Chartering Ships to Adjust Themselves: After the Vladivostok-Shanghai route was opened, the country had a large number of timber and salted fish transported to our country. The company's ship, Laixi Foreign Firm in this port (the authorized representative of the Soviet Russian Commercial Fleet operating on the China-Russia route), operated eight ships, which was not enough. It ordered Laixi to first charter twenty merchant ships in Shanghai to transport fish and wood from northern Russia to Vladivostok. At the end of April, it continued to order a large number of ships to be chartered in Shanghai to rush to load goods to Russia. At that time, more than a dozen Chinese merchant ships, such as Taishan, Fengxiang, Minghe, and Wuyang, and the British Brain Charter were scheduled to go there. In this month alone, more than thirty ships sailed to northern Russia specifically to transport Russian lumber and various salted fish, etc. To date, all chartered ships have been adjusted, and the goods to China have been loaded at Vladivostok and are waiting to be transported.</p>
<p>Purchasing Chinese Tea: Since the Laixi ships began operating on the Shanghai-Vladivostok route, more than 40,000 tons of Hubei tea (commonly known as tea bricks) have been loaded into Russia in these four months. Now that the tea bricks have been transported, Russian merchants are preparing to purchase new tea leaves for export. According to custom, Russia must start purchasing new tea in Shanghai from the Beginning of Summer Festival in China, but this year it will be more than a month later in terms of time. However, the Shanghai side still entrusts the Jinling Foreign Firm to handle the entire Chinese tea agency, and the Laixi ships are the sole carriers.</p>
<p>Preparing to Open a Formal Service: According to custom, the time when new Chinese tea enters the market is also the day when Russian northern goods are crowded into Vladivostok. Now, because Laixi's giant ships have all been opened to Vladivostok, the Soviet Russian Commercial Fleet's transportation of Russian Chinese tea and timber, salted fish, etc. to China will begin to start, and the long-planned formal liner service between China and Russia will be determined to be implemented. According to Laixi, this Shanghai-Vladivostok scheduled liner service will be launched from Vladivostok by the Soviet Union Commercial Fleet within 20 days at the latest. At least four ships or six ships will be launched first, depending on the amount of import and export goods. There will be a fixed date for ships to Russia every month thereafter. As for Chinese who go to Russia, they are still very rare recently, and there are not many foreigners from Shanghai who go to Vladivostok either.</p>
<h3>Land Bureau Consolidates Municipal Taxes</h3>
<p>The Municipal Land Bureau has found that people must pay taxes according to regulations when buying and selling land in the city, but many old contracts have not yet completed tax payment and transfer. In order to consolidate municipal taxes and consolidate the people's property rights, the bureau has set a deadline of the end of June of this year for all owners of properties in the city who previously used Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance contracts issued by the old Shanghai and Bao counties to come to the bureau to pay taxes. After the deadline, they will be punished by adding three times the regular tax. The municipal affairs commissioners of each district have been notified to check and order all localities to comply.</p>
<h3>Fluidity Groups Request Laws and Regulations</h3>
<p>The joint office of more than 30 small merchant groups in this port yesterday sent a telegram to the Nanjing Central Party Department, the National Government Legislative Yuan, President Hu, and Minister of Industry and Commerce Kong, saying that peddlers and brokers are legitimate businesses. According to Article 1 of the Law on Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations, there seems to be no reason why they cannot establish trade associations. The municipal party department, municipal government, and social bureau of this city have successively submitted requests to the central government, the government, the court, and the ministry to quickly issue a clear order explaining this. At the same time, the office, in conjunction with the peddlers and all fluidity commercial groups in this city, stated the reasons why they should be reorganized and appealed for relief. In order to maintain the dignity of the law and take into account the facts, it is requested that a separate set of laws and regulations be formulated outside the Law on Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations to show thoroughness and provide relief. It was approved and is awaiting review by the central government. However, several months have passed without any clear indication. Before the Law on Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations was promulgated, the peddlers, brokers, and commercial groups with fluidity that had been organized in this city included the vegetable stall branch, vegetable land cargo association, lime boat merchant association, cloth peddler branch, chicken peddler branch, rice cake branch, Yimiao Yu Garden branch, Shanghai South Merchant Ship Association, Jiangbei Shanghai Fresh Pork Transport Merchant Association, book peddler branch, fruit industry, yarn industry, French Concession peddler industry, barge industry, and more than 30 groups. Most of them have been registered by the municipal party department and the social bureau of this city, and their association affairs are proceeding without any disparity with other industry groups. However, since the promulgation of the Law on Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations, the business reorganization committee has not reorganized them, making it impossible for these industry groups to proceed with their association affairs, and there is no basis for them. It is impossible to dissolve them, and there is nowhere to reorganize them. The situation is extremely difficult. However, the situation in this city is extremely complex. Judging from past habits and facts, this problem should be resolved as soon as possible to avoid disputes. Therefore, we send another telegram to request that you quickly formulate a separate set of laws and regulations so that the groups that have already been organized can be reorganized according to law, and the future groups can also unite according to these laws and regulations to seek public interests. The future of commerce depends on it. We are anxiously awaiting orders. Respectfully submitted by the Joint Office of More Than Thirty Commercial Groups in Shanghai Special Municipality.</p>
<h3>The Gonghe Ship Sailed to Hankou Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Changing Compradors and Workers Almost Led to Disputes, but Ultimately the New Workers Showed Concession</p>
<p>The British-owned Jardine Matheson's Gonghe ship has been under repair in Shanghai for two weeks. The comprador, Huang Dingzhu, officially resigned some time ago. It is reported that Wang Yunru, a native of Suzhou, will take over. During the transition, disputes once occurred between the new and old workers. There were a total of 84 new workers and 76 old workers. Disputes occurred between the two sides in the spring of last year. After mediation by the Hankou Municipal Party Department and other agencies, it was agreed that the new and old workers would work in shifts. This time, Comprador Wang took over and appointed both sides to cooperate, but the company stipulated that the number of workers should not exceed 120. As a result, there was a heated dispute between the two sides. Ultimately, the new workers showed concession, reducing their number to 40, and each paid a deposit. The old workers added four more people to make up 80, and were exempt from paying the deposit. The matter has now been resolved and the ship sailed to Hankou yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Investigating Rental Housing for Japanese Residents in Zhabei</h3>
<p>In Preparation for Taxation</p>
<p>Xu Zhi, director of the Municipal Northern Tax Collection Office of the Shanghai Special Municipal Finance Bureau, has resolved the issue of negotiating housing donations with Japanese residents after both sides made concessions. Yesterday, he received a formal letter from Lin Xiongji, chairman of the Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce, stating that the consul had understood that representatives from all roads had unanimously agreed to pay donations in accordance with regulations starting from April 1. After receiving the letter, Xu reported it to Director Xu and appointed Zhao Zhenchao and Shi Jiugang to investigate the exact number of rental housing for overseas Chinese in preparation for taxation, which is scheduled to begin on May 12.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau to Investigate Currently Used Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau has conducted a survey of the use of weights and measures in various industries in the city. The size of the weights and measures should be checked against the new instruments in advance to promote the new system by eliminating fraud. It ordered the subordinate merchant groups to collect the instruments used in each industry for investigation and report the results. After receiving the document, the bureau ordered each group to comply. It is also reported that the bureau will send personnel to carry out one-by-one checks with the new instruments one day.

<h3>Another Fraud Case Discovered at the Municipal Bank</h3>
<p>Mortgages on the Houses and Land Title Deeds Used as Share Capital Were Disposed of by the Bank Without Permission, and the Owners Were Fooled After Seeing the News in the Newspapers. Zhang Weiyong and Others Were Accused Again.</p>
<p>Lu Ziqing, a comprador for Dodwell &amp; Co., and Zhang Weiyong, a managing director of the China Municipal Bank (which closed down not long ago), and General Manager Wu Xibai are involved in a lawsuit over a loan, as previously reported in the newspapers. However, the third 30,000 tael loan extended by Lu included real estate in Baodai Lane in the city as collateral. Now, a lawsuit has arisen regarding this real estate. The plaintiff is Li Jingyuan, who resides at No. 2 Santai Lane, Baodai Lane, Xiaodongmen. In addition to Zhang Weiyong and Wu Xibai, the bank's clerk, Ma Shuwang, and confidential secretary, Yu Luqing, are also accused of jointly defrauding for profit. According to the plaintiff's complaint, Ma and Yu repeatedly persuaded and induced Li to become a shareholder of the China Municipal Bank from the end of the previous year to last winter, but Li Jingyuan had been working in the north and was unfamiliar with the business conditions in the south, so he repeatedly declined. After their repeated persuasion, and because Ma was a relative and Yu was a former colleague from the Jinpu Railway, he believed they would not deceive him and agreed to subscribe for 5,000 yuan in shares. At the time, because he did not have the money, Ma suggested that he hand over a total of twelve documents, including the new and old title deeds and plans of the Yilu houses in Baodai Lane, as collateral for the 5,000 yuan in share capital to the bank, and he obtained a receipt issued in the name of Qinghe Hall from the defendants. However, the receipt was issued in the name of Qinghe Hall. On December 24 of last year, Zhang Weiyong, in his capacity as managing director of the bank, and Wu Xibai, in his capacity as general manager, hired Li as the director of the bank's savings department. The contract was witnessed by Ma and Yu. On January 6, when Li went to work, he discovered that the bank's capital had long been exhausted and that it was only relying on a small number of depositors' savings to operate. He then realized that Ma and Yu had made false statements. He sternly questioned them, but they prevaricated. Li left the bank on the 20th of the month and demanded the return of the title deeds. At first, they evaded, but when there was no way to deny it, they said that it had been mortgaged. On the 8th of this month, he read an advertisement in the Shen Bao in which lawyer Ye Fokan, representing Lu Ziqing, declared a mortgage right. The collateral referred to was the house title deed that Li had been swindled out of. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit requesting that Zhang, Wu, Ma, and Yu be brought to trial and that the twelve title deeds and plans that had been swindled from him be recovered. Yesterday morning, the police served the summons to Zhang and the others. Magistrate Sun Yuan opened the court for a hearing. The plaintiff, Li Jingyuan, accompanied by his attorney, described the process of being swindled and presented various evidence. According to the defendant Ma Shuwang, Li Jingyuan came to Shanghai from Hangzhou because he was unemployed and asked me to find him a job. I introduced him to the Municipal Bank. Yu Luqing was the initial founder of the bank, and Zhang Weiyong and Wu Xibai joined later. Magistrate Sun asked why the bank was operating in Shanghai, but registered in Hong Kong. Ma could not answer and only said that the bank was currently in liquidation. According to Yu Luqing, the bank was founded in 1925. I left the bank in May 1929 after Zhang and Wu joined. The original registered capital was 100,000 yuan, which was fully collected by the China Remittance Bank. After the Remittance Bank went bankrupt, I also left. The registration of the bank in Hong Kong was on September 1 of last year, at which time I had already resigned. In the case that the plaintiff is accusing me of, I am only in the position of a witness. Magistrate Sun felt that Yu Luqing's testimony was mostly evasive, and was touched by the fact that the 600,000 yuan fraud case that he had tried the afternoon before was very similar in nature. They were nothing more than issuing bills in excess to induce people to provide huge sums of money. This kind of fraudulent behavior is a scourge on society. He severely rebuked them. He then questioned the defendant Zhang Weiyong, who said that he had been released on bail the day before because he was being held in another case. He also claimed that he joined the bank to re-solicit shares and planned to raise 250,000 yuan, but he did not raise enough. The major shareholder was Wu Jinji, who was the first president of the bank, and Lu Ziqing succeeded Wu. However, Zhang's testimony about the alleged case was evasive. According to the defendant Wu Xibai, the plaintiff's title deeds were mortgaged by me at Qinghe Hall to a Mr. Liu. After Liu was involved in a lawsuit, he returned the title deeds to the Municipal Bank. Magistrate Sun ordered the four defendants to each pay a bail of 10,000 yuan and set the date for another hearing on May 26. The defendants' lawyers requested ordinary bail and made repeated applications. The order was changed to each posting a joint guarantee from three companies before being released pending trial.</p>
<h3>Liu Siqiao Dies Tragically, Compensation of 10,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Case is Settled Peacefully, and a Petition to Withdraw the Charges is Filed</p>
<p>The Chinese medicine doctor, Liu Siqiao, was hit and killed by a car driven by a Cantonese man, Pan Shiqu, on his way home from proofreading the books he translated at the Hua Feng Printing Office. Liu's wife, Liu Li, later retained lawyer Jiang Yiping to file a lawsuit against Pan, requesting that he be severely punished according to law and that he pay a large amount of compensation for the loss. The Special District Court has already summoned him for trial. Because Liu Li claimed to be ill, the trial has been postponed several times as previously reported. Now, friends and relatives of both parties have come forward to mediate in order to avoid a prolonged lawsuit. It is reported that both parties have followed the advice. Pan paid the deceased's family 10,000 yuan in cash as compensation, and Liu Li has agreed to accept this amount. Thus, the matter has been settled peacefully. Yesterday afternoon, the case was originally scheduled for continued hearing. At that time, the lawyer arrived in court and filed a petition to withdraw the charges, which was approved by the presiding judge.</p>
<h3>Cases Reserved for Third Instance Will Be Heard by the Higher Branch Court</h3>
<p>The announcement of the Second Branch of the High Court of the Jiangsu High Court. Preliminary civil cases that were originally adjudicated by the Provisional Court and reserved for the third instance will now be heard by the Second Branch of the High Court of Jiangsu, as determined by the Judicial Yuan. Xu Weizhen, the president of the court, has now received an order from the ministry and issued an announcement yesterday ordering the litigants to comply. The announcement is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>For the announcement of matters, the Judicial Administration Department issued Order No. 948, stating that it should be decided whether the cases in Shanghai. The preliminary civil cases previously handled by the Provisional Court and reserved for the third instance of appeal should be handled by the Court. The original presentation to the Judicial Yuan was Order No. 160, stating that the preliminary jurisdiction of the former Shanghai Provisional Court was responsible for retaining third-instance appeal cases. It should be handled by the Second Court of the Jiangsu Higher Court. It is requested that the court comply. This is an announcement for all to know.</p>
<h3>Three Cars from a Large Gambling Den Confiscated</h3>
<p>Someone Filed a Petition to Claim Them, but it Was Determined That They Were Provided by the Gambling Den, So They Were Confiscated</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau broke up a gambling den on Kang Nao Road and detained six cars. Three of them, Public Concession No. 3758 (City No. 201), Public Concession No. 3307 (City No. 2382), and French Concession No. 11536, were suddenly petitioned for by someone three days ago, claiming that they were provided by gamblers and requesting permission to claim them. Director Yuan sent officers to investigate the matter cautiously. However, it was discovered that the three cars were all provided by the gambling den to transport gamblers. Therefore, it was decided to confiscate them and temporarily place them in the garage north of the General Bureau. As for the remaining three cars, Concession No. 2037 (City No. 921), Concession No. 2858 (City No. 5511), and Concession No. 7493, which were actually provided by gamblers or transferred by relatives and friends, they were allowed to be claimed, but they will have to wait a day or two before the items are returned to their owners.</p>
<h3>Pork Merchants Strike in Pudong Along the Banks</h3>
<p>Opposing Slaughter and Inspection</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau has stipulated that each urban area in the city must establish a pig slaughtering association for the sale of pork by fresh meat merchants, and that the pigs in each district must first be examined by a veterinarian to ensure that they are healthy before they can be slaughtered and sold. The slaughter in the Yangjing district of Pudong is located in Yangjing Town, so the pork merchants along the banks in the territory, such as Yangjiadu, Lujia渡, Lan泥渡, Lujiazui, and Lujiaz宅, must transport the pigs to Yangjing every day for inspection. However, the pork merchants in the above-mentioned places have not complied with the regulations due to the long distance to and from, and have not actually implemented it after repeated urging by the Health Bureau. Now, the Health Bureau believes that the weather is getting hotter and that the sale of pork that has not been inspected may be unsanitary, which is detrimental to hygiene. Therefore, it implemented a crackdown a few days ago and ordered that pork from the above-mentioned pork shops that has not been inspected and branded must not be sold. As a result, the merchants were in an uproar and discussed countermeasures, deciding to strike collectively in order to resist. Therefore, from yesterday, all the fresh meat shops along the banks were closed and plastered with slogans, requesting understanding from the health authorities. The turmoil had not been resolved by the evening.</p>
<h3>Dark Shadows on the Beach</h3>
<p>Four People Suspicious Near the Fortress, Two Arrested and Handguns Searched Out</p>
<p>The Longwang Temple on the beach across the river from the Wusong Fortress (the boundary of Gaoqiao District, Pudong) is guarded by a small fortress built by the Wusong Fortress Naval Command, with sixty marines stationed there. At about 11 o'clock the night before, when the soldiers on duty were guarding the fortress, they suddenly saw four people walking on the beach near the fortress in the dark shadows. The soldiers suspected that the people were behaving suspiciously and immediately reported it to the fortress commander without making a sound. The commander sent a large group of soldiers to encircle and capture them. When the people saw that the situation was bad, they immediately turned around and fled. The soldiers chased them along the beach for about a mile before capturing two of them. Two handguns were searched from their bodies and they were taken back to the fortress for interrogation. However, they refused to confess. After receiving the report, the Naval Headquarters dispatched a ship to Wusong at 10 a.m. yesterday to take the two criminals to the military law office of the headquarters for investigation. It also ordered the Haihong warship to sail to the Wusongkou and patrol the waters near the fortress from last night to suppress the situation.</p>
<h3>Philippine National Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Sought money from his wife, an argument ensued, first he injured his wife with a knife, then shot himself; the deceased's recent situation was miserable.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning (the 10th), before dawn, a Filipino, Lee Vo Luo, at 3206 Hai Ning Road, injured his wife with a knife due to a petty argument. He then shot himself. When it was dawn, the American Concession police were notified and after an interrogation, the hearing was adjourned for further investigation. Lee's wife is currently hospitalized in the Public Hospital. Although her neck injury is severe, she is expected to survive. Her husband died instantly. According to witness Fox, who lived in the same residence, he was suddenly awakened by a gunshot around 3 a.m., panicked and unable to do anything. Before he could inquire about the details, he went out to Kunshan Road to notify the deceased's relatives and report to the police station. The previous evening, he heard the deceased arguing with his wife for failing to obtain money. Another witness, Mrs. Mengdu Chai, who also lived in the same residence, said she initially heard a gunshot and Lee's wife crying for help. She immediately went out of her room and saw the Lee couple wrestling. The deceased held a knife in his left hand and a gun in his right. His wife had already suffered a knife wound on her neck and was bleeding heavily. She helped Lee's wife try to seize the gun from the deceased. Subsequently, Lee's wife fainted and fell to the ground due to excessive bleeding. She then ran back upstairs. At that time, she glimpsed the deceased kneeling beside his wife, holding the gun with both hands, aiming it at his forehead, and shouting "God, forgive me." As she ran to the stairs, she heard a gunshot. When she looked back, the deceased had fallen to the ground after being shot. She heard a total of two gunshots that night, one when she first woke up and the other just as she was about to return upstairs. Finally, the deceased's stepdaughter's husband, Fa Qie Du, testified that his parents-in-law often argued, but he did not expect them to have a handgun. The two had been in love since childhood, and although they were not formally married, they had been living together for 25 years. In the past two years, because his father-in-law had a crippled leg and could not make a living, his mother-in-law made a living by preparing meals for others.</p>
<h3>A Bridal Party Disrupted by a Gang of Women</h3>
<p>The two newlyweds were covered in feces. There was a hidden story, an old mistress whose beauty faded when her money ran out, and a groom who seemed ungrateful.</p>
<p>Hu Lipin from Ningbo yesterday rented the Dahua Hotel on Baoshan Road, Zhabei, to hold a wedding ceremony with Ms. Hu Aying. Unexpectedly, just as the wedding banquet was in full swing and everyone was in high spirits, a gang of women suddenly appeared, each holding brooms, chamber pots, and other dirty implements. With a menacing aura, they barged into the wedding hall and, without asking any questions, broke the wedding candles and overturned the wine tables. A middle-aged woman held a package of feces and threw it fiercely at the bride and groom. Fortunately, they both dodged it, but the stench was overwhelming and unbearable. The guests were astonished at the sight and covered their noses, retreating in a flurry. The hotel staff stepped forward to question them, but they only assaulted the staff. The staff reported to the police at the station. Seeing the situation was not good, the bride seized the opportunity and fled. Hu and the woman were taken to the Fifth District Headquarters, where Director You interrogated them. According to Hu Lipin, 38 years old, the woman was his mistress for several years, but she was inherently promiscuous and lavished her affection on others. He had repeatedly reprimanded her without success, so he broke up with her and filed a lawsuit in court. Now, he was marrying Ms. Hu, but she came to disrupt the wedding and attacked him on the chest and back with dirty implements, causing minor injuries. His sister, Ms. Chen, was beaten in the leg and could not walk. Most regrettably, the bride was frightened and fled without a trace. He requested a thorough investigation. The woman, Wang Caizhi, 33 years old, confessed that Hu Lipin had been an employee in the iron shop opened by her late husband. After her husband passed away, because the shop lacked manpower, she became intimately involved with him, and it had been 13 years. She had always treated him as a husband, and all the money and accounting were entrusted to his care. Unexpectedly, he became tired of her over time and wanted to abandon her, leading to a lawsuit in court. He begged for a reconciliation, but he said it was impossible and refused to negotiate. He even falsely accused her of being unchaste and remarried, while she was running out of money and her beauty faded, making it difficult for her to remarry. He should continue to live with her. Director You reviewed the confessions and, as the case involved disputes over adultery, ordered it to be sent to the bureau for investigation.</p>

<h3>Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Cracks Down on "Wild Chicken" Cars Soliciting Passengers</h3>
<p>The first route of the Chinese public bus company often has "wild chicken" cars parked and soliciting passengers at the corner of Baoshan Road and Tongji Road, even recklessly boarding the bus to solicit passengers. The same situation also occurs at the Baoshan Road intersection of the third route. The company has submitted a request to the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities to crack down on this practice in order to maintain traffic. The bureau believes that parking other vehicles near public bus stops hinders traffic, and after consultation with the Municipal Public Security Bureau, police have been instructed to pay attention to cracking down on this practice at any time.</p>
<h3>Fish Market Stall Dispute Trial</h3>
<p>Plaintiff arrived with white cloth wrapped around their heads, witnesses testified to the circumstances of the assault.</p>
<p>The Qianfeng Fish Market outside the Xiaodongmen Bund in the French Concession was encroached upon by the neighboring Fukang Fish Market. It was reported that a few days ago, shareholders of Fukang, Shui Jia Kuan, and manager Zhang Zhisheng, along with their associates Chen Aqing and Wang Ashuang, and others gathered a crowd to assault the employees of Qianfeng Market, Wang Mingyuan, Yan Zuying, Liu Zhusheng, and eight others, causing injuries. The plaintiff, Qianfeng Market, represented by lawyer Yan Bahe, filed a lawsuit in the French court. Yesterday, eight plaintiffs, all with white cloth wrapped around their heads, arrived at the court to await the hearing. First, Judge Zhu inquired about the circumstances of the initial conflict from both parties. Then, the plaintiff's lawyer, Bahe, stated that both the plaintiff and the defendant were operating fish markets and setting up fish stalls in front of their doors. Unexpectedly, recently, the plaintiff's stall was encroached upon by the Fukang Fish Market. The plaintiff argued with them, but the defendants were unreasonable and slapped the plaintiff's employees. The matter was resolved through persuasion at the time. Shockingly, the next day, the defendants led 56 employees from the Fukang, Yuantong, and Taichang fish markets, each holding sticks, to Qianfeng Market and beat anyone they encountered, causing injuries to all the plaintiffs. When the police arrived, the group dispersed in a panic. Now, the plaintiff has injury reports to prove that the defendants violated Articles 293 and 294 of the criminal law and requests a heavy punishment to deter illegal activities. The plaintiffs all stated that they were working in the market that morning when the defendants suddenly led 50 to 60 people to arrive and indiscriminately beat anyone they encountered. The plaintiffs were all beaten to the ground, and those who were not beaten fled to the neighboring Fengtai cigarette and paper store to hide. This was the truth. Then, Ding Hengkang, the owner of the Fengtai cigarette and paper store, testified in court that he witnessed the defendants leading dozens of people, each holding sticks, to Qianfeng Market to commit the assault. The defendants jointly hired lawyer Yao Zhaodi to defend them, claiming that the reason for the conflict was not the dispute over the stall, but that the defendant's employees mistakenly swept garbage to the plaintiff's stall, causing the dispute. At the time, Zhang Zhisheng and Shui Jia Kuan were not present and did not lead the crowd. He requested an investigation. After a lengthy mutual argument between the two lawyers, Judge Zhu announced that the debate was over and that the judgment would be reviewed and decided upon.</p>
<h3>Inside Story of the Murder Case in the Yin Xing District</h3>
<p>Zhu's wife was actually the mastermind, secretly poisoning her husband.</p>
<p>Zhu Xiaomao, also known as Zhu Xinzhou, a 43-year-old villager in the Yin Xing District of Hudong, was robbed and killed by bandits on the night of March 24th of this year. Thirty yuan in silver dollars, two gold forks, and a pearl hairpin were lost. His stepwife, Zhu Sun, was the only one unharmed. The local police reported the incident to the local court for verification and ordered an investigation. However, after the incident, the Fourth Precinct of the Fifth District sent detectives to investigate the details. They learned that Zhu Sun, still in her prime, was extremely promiscuous and had illicit relations with no fewer than six or seven men. Her younger brother, Sun Jiangzhu, knew everything. Jiangquan did not engage in legitimate work and often used this to demand money from his sister. Recently, she realized her mistakes and had changed her ways. She no longer provided for her brother's demands. Sun Jiangquan harbored resentment and colluded with Zhao Gengsheng and others to pretend to be robbers and rob his brother-in-law's home. Zhu Xiaomao recognized them and scolded them, saying he would settle accounts with them the next day, causing great alarm to his accomplices. They killed Zhu Xiaomao to silence him. Afterwards, the woman remained silent and dared not reveal anything. After the detectives learned the truth, they arrested Sun Jiangquan. Under strict interrogation, he confessed everything. They also arrested the woman. At first, she denied it, but after severe interrogation, she confessed as before. They immediately presented the case to the Public Security Bureau, where the judicial section interrogated her and transferred her to the local court for investigation yesterday. After a preliminary examination by the prosecutor, the defendants suddenly reversed their previous confessions and refused to admit anything. Therefore, they were ordered to be detained pending investigation.</p>
<h3>Return and Valuation of Cargo Ship License Plates</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities originally charged four yuan per ship for issuing license plates and lights for cargo ships. Now, the municipal government has changed it to three yuan per ship. The bureau has revised the previous regulations for returning and valuing license plates, which has been approved by the municipal government. The valuation is as follows: two license plates are returned for two yuan, a set of signal lights is returned for sixty cents, and a lamp holder is returned for eight cents. The four metal borders</p>

<p>Republic of China Nineteenth Year, May 11 (Shen Bao Fourth Edition) Sunday (16)</p>
<p>are valued at thirty-two cents, totaling three yuan, which is consistent with the original license plate fee paid. However, if the license plates are damaged, broken, or unusable, they will not be accepted for return.</p>
<h3>Solicitation for Donations from Shop Owners by the Songhu Reformation Institute Halted</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs Urges the Submission of Donation Books</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs believes that the collection of donations from shop owners for the Songhu Reformation Institute is scattered and difficult to audit, and door-to-door solicitations are close to disturbing merchants. When the Shanghai Charity Association took over the institute, it instructed that the fundraising be stopped immediately, and that a clear list of all donation book stubs should be prepared for review. It has now been verified that thirteen books are still missing, making it impossible to guarantee that unscrupulous people are not soliciting donations privately under false pretenses. Therefore, it has ordered the former director of the institute, Wang Zhaocheng, to be responsible for urging the submission of all donation books, and instructed the former donation collectors to comply and not to withhold or embezzle them under any pretext. It also hopes that citizens will pay attention, and if any of the above-mentioned donation books are found, they should hand over the evidence to the bureau for legal action.</p>
<h3>Son Catches Stepmother in Adultery</h3>
<p>Hu Deyou feared his lover would harm him.</p>
<p>Hu Deyou, 18 years old from Anhui, set up a pancake stall at No. 320, Wangjia Wharf, Nanshi. His father, Hu Zonggui, passed away last February, leaving behind his stepmother, Ms. Chen, 34 years old. After her husband's death, she was not accustomed to sleeping alone, so she became intimately involved with Dai Shougen, a boatman from Yangzhou who was a friend of Wang A'er, who lived upstairs. Dai would sneak into her house late at night to meet her secretly more than once. Although Hu had discovered the situation, he endured it because of the mother-son relationship. Unexpectedly, he recently heard that she regarded him as a thorn in her side and wanted to find a way to harm him so that she could be with her lover forever. Hu was extremely alarmed. Therefore, yesterday morning around 2 a.m., he and his friends, taking advantage of his mother's rendezvous with her lover, went forward and shouted, "Catch the adulterers!" and captured the pair of lovebirds. They immediately handed them over to Liao Jiangqing, the watchman of the Fourth Station, who took them to the First Precinct of the First District. The director of the station conducted a preliminary interrogation and, as the matter involved adultery, ordered a document to be prepared and the man and woman to be sent to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Abduction of a Seventeen-Year-Old Girl</h3>
<p>Zhang Sanbao falsely claimed to be her fiancé.</p>
<p>Shen Qiubao, a 17-year-old girl from Jinshan who claimed to be a maid at No. 1 Yongde Lane, Wenmiao Street, Nanshi, was recently lured by Zhang Sanbao, a 29-year-old man from Danyang who was a porridge shop employee, to open a room at the Xinmin Hotel on Xinmin Road, Zhabei, for a rendezvous. The police found them during a patrol and, suspecting their behavior, took them to the First Precinct of the Fourth District. After interrogation by Director Yao, Zhang Sanbao claimed that Qiubao was his fiancée and that he was staying in the hotel for one night because he had not been able to rent a house in Zhabei. When questioned, Shen Qiubao stammered. Observing her appearance, she seemed to be a daughter of a good family. Therefore, the police were sent to Nanshi to investigate, but they could not find Shen's family. It was clear that Zhang Sanbao had abducted a girl. A document was immediately prepared and sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for verification.</p>
<h3>A Scandalmonger Causes a Life</h3>
<p>Dai Jiang's humiliated by false accusations of unchastity, committed suicide by swallowing smoke.</p>
<p>Dai Weixing, a local man who worked at the Xiaoshijie in the Yimiao, rented a house at No. 6 Junyi Lane, Lujia Lane, nearby. His wife, Ms. Jiang, 34 years old, managed the household affairs in an orderly manner. Unexpectedly, a certain woman in the neighborhood spread rumors falsely accusing her of unchastity. When she heard this, she was indignant and unwilling to live. Yesterday afternoon at 2:15, she secretly swallowed raw smoke in an attempt to end her life. It was not until 5:00 p.m. that someone noticed and sent her to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, because she had taken poison for too long, she died shortly after. The local police were notified and ordered detectives to arrive and send the body to the coroner's office for examination.</p>
<h3>Wife of a Police Officer Goes Missing</h3>
<p>Li Cuibao, among others, may be involved.</p>
<p>Wang Zhanfei, 33 years old from Qingjiang, who lives at No. 65 Xinkang Lane, Kangnuotuo Road, Huxi, has been working as a patrolman at the Laoza Gate police station. His wife, Xiaomei, 25 years old, has been married for over five years. The couple's relationship is still harmonious. Last year, when Xiaomei went to work in a factory, she went out to play with her sisters-in-law, Wu. During the past week, Xiaomei suddenly disappeared. Wang searched everywhere, but to no avail. After repeated investigations, he learned that his wife's disappearance was closely related to Li Cuibao, a woman who lives at No. 75 Luxue House, Bailinan Road (Li and Xiaomei were the closest of sisters-in-law). Wang went to Li's address and questioned her. Li bluntly told him that his wife, Xiaomei, had been abducted and hidden by Chen Abao, who lived in a bungalow on Kangnuotuo Road. Yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m., Wang and Li rushed to Chen's house. Abao was not at home. Kuang Rongming, Chen Housheng, and Hua Xiaolang were conspiring with Abao's mother, Gao Chen, to dispose of Xiaomei and sell her for a price. Wang overheard this and was furious. He immediately called the police, who arrested all the people involved and took them back to the Sixth District Police Station. After separate interrogations by Director Duan, the plaintiff, Wang Zhanfei, described the circumstances of his wife's disappearance. The defendant, Li Cuibao, 23 years old from Jiading, who lives in Luxue House, said that she had learned that Xiaomei had been abducted by Chen Abao, so she told Wang directly. Chen Gao, 56 years old, claimed that her son Abao had been out for ten days and she did not know whether he had abducted Xiaomei. Kuang Rongming, 35 years old from Jiangyin, Chen Housheng, 23 years old from Jiangyin, and Hua Xiaolang, 25 years old from Jiangyin, all lived at No. 13 Xingjiapo Road and sold fruit. Their other statements were very cunning and they denied conspiring to abduct Xiaomei. Director Duan reviewed the confessions and, as the case involved conspiring to abduct a married woman, immediately prepared a document to send the six people involved to the local court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Files for Divorce</h3>
<p>A local young woman, Yang Cuilin, has filed for divorce with the local court through lawyer Chen Weidong because she was abused by her husband, Qu Heshang, and went on a three-day hunger strike. Yesterday, Judge Du opened the court session. The plaintiff, Yang Cuilin, 22 years old, currently residing at her mother's home in Yangjia House, Pudong, stated that she married the defendant, Qu Heshang, on the sixteenth day of the first month when she was nineteen years old through a matchmaker. Unexpectedly, after entering the family, the defendant disliked her appearance and often treated her cruelly. She could not bear the suffering, so she returned to her mother's home to stay temporarily. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that in addition to abusing and beating the plaintiff, the defendant also imprisoned the plaintiff in a room and did not allow her to eat. The defendant's sister saw this and could not bear it, so she secretly released the plaintiff. Then, the plaintiff went to a nearby Catholic church. Later, the defendant's father went to retrieve her and promised that he would prevent the defendant from abusing her again in the future. The reason for this was that the plaintiff's parents-in-law嫌the plaintiff's dowry was meager and that she did not know how to flatter them, so they disliked her. The defendant, Qu Heshang, 22 years old, a local man living in Lujia Hang, Pudong, who makes a living by farming, stated that he did not beat her and did not want a divorce. Yang Miaolin, 24 years old, stated that Cuilin was her sister and that she was currently working as a clerk at the Tongtai 麻袋 shop on Minguo Road in Shanghai. She also described the defendant's abuse of the plaintiff in detail and stated that she had reported the defendant to the local public security bureau twice, but the defendant had avoided them by fleeing. Because the defendant had another mistress, he regarded her sister as a thorn in his side. For example, in February of this year, the defendant was caught in adultery and the police station sent the defendant to the prosecutor's office for detention for many days. The judge ordered Yang Miaolin and the defendant, Qu Heshang, to confront each other in court, but the defendant denied the abuse with a smile. The judge was very angry and severely reprimanded the defendant, saying that because this was a court of law, the court rules should be followed, and that it was not permissible for him to laugh casually, which was a blatant disrespect for the court and showed that he was not a good person. The defendant listened to the instructions with "yes, yes." Yang Miaolin further stated that the defendant's friend, Tong Aquan, was instructed by the defendant to come to her house to talk and told her sister not to hire a lawyer to fight the lawsuit, and that they could get a divorce easily outside. The defendant said, "Although I know Tong Aquan, I did not entrust him. Besides, he is not a good person, so why would I entrust him?" At this point, Cai Axin, 56 years old, who lived in Caijia House, stated that in July of the sixteenth year of the Republic (referring to the plaintiff), this girl (referring to the plaintiff) came to our Catholic church and stayed for one night, saying that it was because the couple was not getting along and even fighting. However, the next day, Qu Fuchao (i.e., the defendant's father) came to pick her up. Our Catholic church is about a mile away from the defendant's home. The judge took the statement and, as the case still required evidence, ordered that the debate not be opened and that a hearing be scheduled to review the case. Then, the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>Shameless Youth</h3>
<p>Purchasing goods with counterfeit banknotes, speeding away on a bicycle, tiring the shop assistant who had to chase after him.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a well-dressed young man rode a bicycle to the Brothers Store on Zhonghua Road, Xiaoximen, and suddenly bought a straw hat, a undershirt, and other items, totaling six yuan. The young man put on the undershirt and hat, and put the remaining items on the bicycle. The shopkeeper saw him arranging the items and did not suspect anything. Unexpectedly, the young man placed a five-yuan note on the counter and sped away on his bicycle. Zhou Zhongfu, the clerk in charge of the store, examined the banknote and realized it was counterfeit. He knew that the young man had planned to use counterfeit banknotes to deceive him. He immediately went out to chase him and caught up with him on Shangwen Road with the help of a police officer. He was arrested and taken to the Second Precinct of the Second District. His name was Wei Peilin, and he was immediately transferred to the local court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Can Ash and Wine Cure Illness?</h3>
<p>Saving Lives Temporarily, Losing Lives Permanently.</p>
<p>Zheng Amao, 52 years old from Ningbo, lived in the pavilion room above the Chen Yuanshun woodworking shop on Xinji Bang Road, Hongkou. Amao used to work as a tea server at Leyuan on Second Ma Road, but he is now unemployed. His wife, Ms. Jin, 38 years old, has a son named Jin Fa, 16 years old, who is an apprentice at the Rixinlong cigarette and paper store on Yuezhou Road. She has been suffering from asthma for several years. When the illness flared up, she would swallow ash and wine to relieve the pain. Yesterday, her old illness flared up again, causing her to faint for a long time. Her family members were helpless, so they used a large amount of ash and mixed it with wine to feed her. They thought it would immediately restore her. However, the toxicity was so severe that she died shortly after. They reported the incident to the local police station, who ordered detectives to arrive and send the body to Tongren Hospital and then to the coroner's office to await the examination.</p>
<h3>Robbers Cause Homeowner to Break Leg</h3>
<p>Jumped off the balcony and shouted for help, breaking both legs.</p>
<p>Shao Rongquan, 45 years old from Yong, who rented a house at No. 1697 Jinglin Lane, Wusong Road, has been working as a stoker on the Blue Funnel Line's Antenor ship for many years. The ship came to Shanghai last Tuesday and is scheduled to set sail this morning. Shao ate and slept at home. Unexpectedly, before dawn yesterday morning, four robbers with local accents broke into the house. Three of them held handguns and one held a sharp blade, prohibiting anyone from making a sound. They searched the suitcase and stole 340 silver dollars, more than ten dimes, gold jewelry, and other items, totaling over a thousand dollars. At the time, Shao took the opportunity to escape to the balcony, jumped down in a hurry, and shouted for help, breaking both legs and falling to the ground. The robbers heard the loud shouts of the homeowner, grabbed the loot, and fled. Shao was sent to Tongren Hospital by his family for treatment.</p>
<h3>Fugitive from Wuxi Prison Arrested in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Escorted back to Wuxi for trial.</p>
<p>A major prison break occurred at Wuxi County Prison on March 25th of this year. Several escaped prisoners, including Wu Xirong and Yuan Asan, were notorious thieves with many crimes. After their escape, the Wuxi County Government ordered a strict investigation and arrest. Police officer Wu Zhenyu of the county learned that Wu and Yuan were hiding in Shanghai and requested that the county magistrate issue an arrest warrant to secretly arrest them in Shanghai. They were found on North Fujian Road the day before yesterday. They called the patrol police for assistance and arrested Wu and Yuan together. They were taken to the Huisi police station for detention and escorted to the Special District Local Court yesterday morning. Judge Sun Yuan proposed the case for preliminary examination. The police officer submitted the official document requesting extradition, and lawyer Wang Yaotang, a lawyer for the police station, also stated that the police station had no objection to the extradition. Judge Sun questioned Wu and Yuan, who also admitted that they had escaped with five other prisoners and did not deny it. He immediately handed the two criminals over to Wu Zhenyu to be escorted back to Wuxi for trial.</p>
<h3>Girl Run Over and Killed by Car</h3>
<p>Brain matter splattered, she died instantly.</p>
<p>Cai Di, daughter of Shen Jiang, who lives in Wangjia House, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, 12 years old, went out shopping yesterday morning around 9 a.m. While walking in the middle of the road, she was suddenly hit by a car driven by Xu Asan. The wheels ran over the back of Cai Di's head, and she died instantly with brain matter splattered. The police arrived and took the car driver to the Second Precinct of the Fifth District for detention. They also ordered the local police to report to the local court and request an immediate inspection.</p>
<h3>A Scene of Stringing Up a White Dove</h3>
<p>Gu Fan was used as a puppet.</p>
<p>Gao Ruqi, 48 years old from Haimen, had been working as a shop assistant at the Yiyuan medicinal materials store on Xiangua Street, Nanshi. Because his monthly income was very low, he had not yet married despite his age. Last year, a fellow townsman, Huang Hanwen, arranged for him to spend 110 yuan to marry Gu Erlang, who lived in Yangjing Town, Pudong. Unexpectedly, less than a month after she entered the household, Erlang disappeared. Gao immediately asked the original matchmaker, Xiao Huang. Because Gu Erlang's background was introduced by his younger brother Sanlang's wife, Gu Fan, he sought compensation from her. Ms. Fan, feeling responsible, had no choice but to search for Erlang's whereabouts once, but there was no trace. Recently, he began to investigate Erlang and found that she was cohabitating with Zhang Youbin on the upper floor of the Yixingchang cigarette and paper store on Ping'an Bridge, Nanmatou. On the evening before last at around 8 p.m., he and Gao Ruqi and Huang Hanwen went to the address and captured the man and woman. They immediately notified Zhang Jinbang, the watchman of the Twentieth Station, who took them to the First Precinct of the First District. During the preliminary hearing by the director of the station, Gu Fan, 33 years old, stated that Erlang was her cousin, also 33 years old. However, she was naturally romantic and had married five or six husbands. She had been illegally cohabitating with Zhang Youbin for over two years. Last year, Erlang suddenly returned to her home and said that she had differences of opinion with Zhang, so she had filed for divorce from Zhang, who agreed, but Zhang needed to be compensated for 80 yuan in losses, so she entrusted her to find a good man to separate from Zhang. At that time, she entrusted Huang Hanwen, who introduced Gao Ruqi to her and gave 80 yuan of the gift money to Zhang to collect. Then, Zhang wrote evidence that he and Erlang were permanently separated. Who would have thought that Erlang had only been at Gao Ruqi's house for a month before running away, clearly showing that they were using her and others as puppets to act in a scene of stringing up a white dove. The Director should thoroughly investigate. The director, in order to deal with the act of releasing white doves, ordered to prepare a document to transfer all of them to the Shanghai Local Court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>County Magistrate Yan Scheduled to be Sworn Into Office</h3>
<p>Acting Shanghai County Magistrate Yan Shenyu had taken office on the 8th of this month. It is now heard that County Magistrate Yan is scheduled to hold a swearing-in ceremony on the 17th. In addition to requesting that his superiors send someone to supervise the swearing-in ceremony, he has also sent letters to various agencies inviting them to attend for guidance.</p>
<h3>Urging the Handling of Land Registration</h3>
<p>Exchanging the square deeds is yet another matter.</p>
<p>Land registration in Shanghai County has been in place for three months, but few people have followed it. However, Director Li of the Finance Bureau once planned to exchange the square deeds when people applied for registration and sent a letter to each district to order each township chief to hire people to sound the gong to promote it. It is now learned that the bureau has received instructions from the Suzhou Finance Office that land registration and the exchange of square deeds are two different matters that are not related to each other. The requested exchange of square deeds during land registration is difficult to approve, and the land registration matters should still be discussed with the County Magistrate and completed within the time limit.</p>
<h3>Five-Thirty Incident Families Support the Family Association's Two Representatives</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of Hu Changsheng and Chen Fucai, two representatives of the Shanghai Five-Thirty Incident Deceased Martyrs' Family Association, who were accused of impersonation and embezzlement of compensation funds, they previously resigned. Upon hearing this, more than twenty people, including Wu Shunbao, a family member of the injured Chen Baoqing and a family member of a deceased martyr, deeply felt uneasy and jointly petitioned for their retention. The original letter stated: "We are writing to you after reading the report on the sixth of this month, stating that you are expressing negativity towards the association's affairs and intend to resign after the impersonation case is concluded. We, the undersigned, feel deeply uneasy upon hearing this. It has been five years since the Five-Thirty Incident occurred. You have endured hardships and toiled diligently, walking alone and going hungry, never giving up. Last year, you received a portion of compensation funds from the British Public Works Bureau. We, the undersigned, are deeply grateful and will never forget where it came from. Now, due to Luo Wenlang's name being used by Li Ruiqing, Wang Zhaohua (i.e., Wang Daohua), He Hanwen, and others to impersonate and receive 2,000 yuan, you have been suspected despite your loyalty and slandered despite your integrity, which inevitably disheartens virtuous people. However, since the court hearing news was disclosed in various newspapers on the seventh, the case has been clarified. Luo Wenlang entrusted the wrong people, leading to inviting thieves into the house. Zhichengtai's guarantee is responsible and actually neighbors with the thieves. The fact that you were implicated due to official matters is known not only to us but to everyone in the world. Looking at history, there is no place without petty people and no event without misfortune, even government officials are not immune. We urge you to dismiss your intention to resign and continue to shoulder the difficult task. Although the inspection and compensation have not yet been finalized, now is the time for us to actively strive forward. We earnestly hope that you will muster your courage and move forward, without being discouraged, and uphold the intentions of the directors to strive for success and achieve complete success. We jointly petition for your retention, please be aware. This request is addressed to Hu Changsheng and Chen Fucai, two representatives.</p>
<p>From the families of the deceased martyrs and injured comrades of the Five-Thirty Incident: Chen Baoqing, Zhang Yueqiu, Chen Hequn, George Yinghua, Zhong Yun, Hua Zonghai, Wu Jinhua, Wu Shunbao, Jin Nianping, Jin Zhou, Chen Xingfa, Chen Lie, Chen Zhaochang, Chen Zhaorong, Tan Quanfu, Tan Yuanji, Tang Liangsheng, Tang Tiansheng, Wang Kuibao, Wang Zhou, Yao Shunqing, Yao Tao, Chen Jinfa, Mao Dongsheng, and others.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor of your newspaper:</p>
<p>The item "600,000 Yuan Fraud Case" in your newspaper's local news section today is slightly inconsistent with the facts. The company's creditor group has set up an office and organized a committee to handle the liquidation itself, and our office has not been entrusted to handle registration matters. It is said that lawyer Zou Yu drafted the lawsuit on behalf of the creditor group, is that not so? I am making this correction to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Xu Bingcheng, Xu Fuji, Lawyers</p>

<h3>Mr. Ma Xiangbo's Birthday Speech, Jingqing</h3>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I am deeply grateful for your repeated birthday wishes for "old but not". What Peng Zu and Chen Bo said is nothing but big talk, perhaps a habit of scholars. I ask myself, at most, I am only a hundred years old, and I cannot guarantee that I can live beyond a hundred years.</p>
<p>Tracing back to the colonial policies of Europe and the West, the distant ones date back thousands of years. Mozi in the Warring States period was indeed like the Jewish people, and not necessarily the Indians. Although I have collected and researched, I dare to prove it truthfully. There are those who say that Lao Tzu rode a green ox out of Hangu Pass to Judea to use the Xia culture to transform the barbarians, and so on. This is inevitably far-fetched. China has always held a closed-door policy, and neither culture nor politics have a world perspective, and are ignorant of national conditions, so everything has deteriorated and fallen behind until today. Europe and the West, since Columbus discovered the Americas and found China from the Cape of Good Hope, were a major revolution in their culture. China's diplomatic failure began with the Opium War. The sale of silk by Western merchants was not ordered by the governments of Europe and the West, but was purely the profit of merchants. There was absolutely no political conspiracy. If the Chinese government had notified the governments of those countries by official letter, they could have banned the transportation. Why did it lead to the Opium War? Misunderstandings in religion and so on led to the Eight-Nation Alliance and made a big mistake, resulting in today. This is the international ignorance. The philosophy of "person and self" says that the distinction between humans and animals lies in the distinction between person and self. For example, a child sees a candy peddler, and although saliva is dripping, he does not dare to grab it for himself. He knows to ask his parents for money to buy it. After buying it, he is full of joy. If someone grabs it, he will cry because at this time he knows it is mine. Like a dog seeing a new dried white cabbage.</p>
<p>The great master of Chinese studies, Liang Qichao, often liked to eat dried white cabbage, saying that the refreshing taste of dried white cabbage far surpassed rare delicacies. Liang was from Xinhui, Guangdong, and dried white cabbage is a specialty of his ancestral home.</p>
<p>It is said that Guangdong's dried white cabbage is as famous as Shaoxing's salted dried vegetables, but in fact, only the dried white cabbage produced in Xinhui, Guangdong, is the best. The method is to put fresh and tender white cabbage in boiling water to cook it, then wash it with clean water and dry it in the sun. When it is almost dry, put it in a jar, sprinkle with five-spice and other spices, seal the mouth, and eat it after three or four months, which is especially refreshing.</p>
<p>Dried white cabbage from Xinhui is sold in all provinces and is transported to various countries, with an annual value of more than ten million yuan. Many overseas Chinese in Nanyang, such as Singapore, are from Xinhui, so the market for dried white cabbage from Xinhui is most prosperous in Singapore. Dried white cabbage is a very small and crude product, but it is still worth more than ten million yuan to transport it overseas every year. So, is it not enough to revitalize domestic products and promote overseas trade to benefit the national economy?</p>
<p>Meat, it will be rude and impolite because it has no understanding of "person and self." From this, it can be proved that the nature of human beings is to seek truth, not just to seek utilitarianism. What benefits can be said of the study of astronomy? However, all countries are the same in studying tirelessly. Therefore, the study of knowledge is the spiritual light of mankind, and all want to go to the path of light. When I was young, I had a joke that there is also in philosophy, such as saying to the sun, Ma Xiangbo knows the sun, but the sun does not know Ma Xiangbo, so Ma Xiangbo boasts that he is more noble than the sun, because man is a spiritual thing, and the sun is always a non-spiritual thing, and the more science is invented, the more the creator is incredible. How can there be incompatibility between religion and science? Therefore, I hope for the development of scientific education.</p>
<h3>The Cake-Selling Scholar of Wuxi, Jing Mengdie</h3>
<p>Previously, I read in the newspaper that there was a teacher pulling a rickshaw in Suzhou, so I thought of the cake-selling scholar of Wuxi, revealing that the civility of this world is swept away, and the difficulty of the livelihood of scholars is more convincing. Taoist Banqiao's "extremely cheap to become a scholar" and Huang Zhongze of Changzhou's "a hundred useless is a scholar" are indeed insightful remarks, and not just radical remarks.</p>
<p>Those who have traveled to Wuxi for a long time have seen a person in the market wearing an old long gown, walking in a regular manner, full of poverty, carrying a cake basket, appearing and disappearing in the streets. The person's name is Gu Xinchang, originally from Jingjiang, living in Wuxi for many years. I once met him in a bathhouse next to Chong'an Temple. I was sitting and chatting with my old friend Zhang Zibai, when suddenly I heard a voice from the next room. Listening to it, it was reciting Wang Youjun's Preface to the Orchid Pavilion Collection. We were surprised that there was the sound of reading here, and asked the attendants, they replied with a cake seller. How can a peddler do this? Could it be that the story of Zhao Qi also entrusted to him? We summoned him, and Gu approached us calmly, placing the cake utensils, tidying up his clothes, and bowing as a courtesy. He said that he was familiar with a "Collection of Ancient Prose" and could recite any article from memory without missing a single word. Zibai then gave a couplet to test him, saying, "Reciting articles in the bathroom is like a cry at the end of the road." He was asked to compose a matching line, and he hesitated for a while, barely completing the lower line without grammatical errors, but the sentence was not natural. I then changed the sentence according to its original meaning, saying, "Watching operas in the theater is like reliving past events." We smiled at each other, and Zibai said that the loss of your business due to our chat is my fault, so he gave him more than ten copper coins. He firmly refused, saying, "If you buy my cakes, you can receive the value, otherwise, this money is nameless. It is harmful to you to be generous, and it is harmful to me to be廉. The two are useless." This shows that he never compromises and does not shame the ambition of a poor scholar. We admired him for a long time.</p>
<p>Recently, I am the editor of the "Human Morality Guidelines", which will be widely distributed to all circles. Yesterday, I went to the city with my friend and saw a cake basket on the ferry dock, and there was also this book placed in it. I laughed and pointed to my friend and said, "This must be Mr. Gu's thing." Later, I really saw him. My friend said that this matter is quite similar to the ancient people who read books while carrying firewood. I said that today's reading can no longer seek wealth and honor, and Mr. Gu's intention may be higher than that of Zhu Wengzi.</p>
<h3>Han Gao Chess Affairs Wisdom Sword</h3>
<p>Since returning from Anhui to Beijing, I saw a letter from my friend Guo Xuchu on my desk, informing me of the Chinese Chess Society he had organized in Hankou.</p>
<p>Yizheng Diary Three (2) - A Record by Xie, Leader of the National Walking Group</p>
<p>On the 17th, I woke up at 6:00 AM, washed, and had a light breakfast. At 10:00 AM, the entire group paid respects to the county magistrate and submitted our cards. After a short while, we were led into the reception room by Fu Da, where County Magistrate Tian Bin (courtesy name Zhifu) personally greeted us. I felt that Mr. Tian was refined and scholarly, with no trace of the bureaucratic vices common at the time. Only after conversing with him did I learn that he was a young scholar (Mr. Tian graduated from National Central University with a Bachelor of Commerce degree) who had become a magistrate. We then inquired in detail about the county's history and all relevant matters, and he kindly provided sincere guidance, from which we benefited greatly. He also presented our group with his own works on salt administration and the six ministries of the county government gazette. We then took our leave. Mr. Tian insisted on inviting us to a banquet in the evening to show his hospitality, but we declined out of respect. We could only temporarily accept his kindness and strive to be vigilant in the future, hoping to repay him later. We then went to Juxing Garden for lunch. After the meal, at 1:00 PM, the various government offices were not yet open for visits, so we visited Tianning Temple with our comrades. There was an ancient pagoda standing tall in the sky. Among the pagodas we had seen in more than ten counties, this one was the most ancient and elegant. Its shape was similar to the Leifeng Pagoda on West Lake, but more graceful. Legend has it that Zhenzhou (now Yizheng) was once as prosperous as Yangzhou, hence the saying, "The market south of Zhenzhou is the best in the world." This shows that after the calamity of the Red Turbans, the magnificent buildings were reduced to ruins, and the roads were filled with rubble, creating a desolate scene. However, Zhenzhou was the only city with lush greenery and the charm of gardens. Arriving in front of the temple, we saw an old monk holding a convenient shovel, bending over to pick up stones to repair the road. I stepped forward and said, "Amitabha, the path of convenience leads to the end." The monk replied, "I'm full and have nothing to do, so I pick up bricks." I replied, "Immeasurable merit." At the time, I did not pay attention to the Zen-like meaning in his words. Alas, I missed the true person when I met him. I must lack prajna and be迷by the six thieves of greed, hatred, delusion, and love, unable to realize the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment. Later, Mr. Sun Shaowen, the director of the relief院院, told me that the monk's name was Liao Yuan, he was from Sichuan, and he was 145 years old. His Taoist practice had been completed, and his internal功 was unparalleled (a separate record was written about the old monk Liao Yuan). I didn't expect to meet him, so it must have been緣. Since I knew where the高僧 was, I planned to visit him again. My comrades and I then went to Baisha Park. The park used to be the Temple of Literature. The architectural style of the Temple of Literature and the泮池were also the best here. Next to it was the Kuiguang Pavilion, which is now a public tea garden, well-arranged. Inside was a阁报社 where the public could read, which was a good policy. We then went to the Temple of Literature, which was extremely dilapidated. The former圣殿 is now a丘墟. We were overwhelmed with a sense of melancholy. Liang Daxin, Xu Yintang, and I went to the 内殿. Coincidentally, local officials such as Li Shaoliang (Director of the Education Bureau), Sun Shaowen (Director of the Relief院), Wei Guan Qun (Captain of the Police Team), Yan Jiemei (President of the Education Association), and Zhao Qinzhou (Director of the Public Education Center) came. They first inquired with Zhuang Xueben and Jiang Xijie and learned that we were the walking group. They said that they had been notified by County Magistrate Tian and had come to welcome us. We were ashamed of our lack of learning and talent, and we had only made this漫游. We didn't expect enthusiastic and sympathetic people in society to cherish us so much, making us feel overwhelmed and inspiring us to work even harder.</p>
<p>It has already been established. Guo's chess skill is known to be great in Anhui. A few years ago, the Japanese 7-dan player, Sego, came to China and played two-stone games with our famous players at Zhang Danru's home in Shanghai. Xuchu and Pan Langdong, among others, all played. After Sego returned, he wrote an article for the Chess Journal, praising Xuchu's beautiful opening and the transformative quality of his棋子, and encouraging his youthful talent. This time, Xuchu organized this society in Hankou in collaboration with Duan Shusan, Wei Haihong, Guo Tixing (Xuchu's younger brother, who had previously organized a South China Chess Society in Shanghai and has now gone to Hankou), Song Taisheng, and others. Duan and Wei are also strong players, and they and Xuchu are all known as the top players in Hanzhou.</p>
<p>I am writing this to report on the chess situation in Hanzhou and to recall an event I experienced in Shanghai. In February, I was still traveling in Shanghai and went to the South China Chess Society to watch棋. One day, Guo Tixing invited me to visit Ando Shunpo at the Japanese Club in Hongkou. Ando was a 3-dan player in Japan and the best player among the Japanese expatriates in Shanghai. Tixing played with him, receiving a two-stone handicap, while I browsed the books on display in the room. I happened to see a map of China hanging on the wall. This room was where Ando taught chess. Besides the desks and benches, there was no other decoration, but this map was hung on the wall. I couldn't help but feel a chill. The Japanese pay so much attention to the geography of our country, even leaving this trace in a place for chess and recreation. What are their intentions? The people of our country should be alert!</p>
<h3>A Record of Eating Cherries on the Lake by Li Jiefei</h3>
<p>The land on the island of Houhu in the capital is fertile, and the dense shade forms a canopy, especially abundant with cherries, whose reputation resounds throughout the southeast half of the country. When the summer days are long and comfortable, the gentle breeze is clear and peaceful, the scent of maltose and wheat is fragrant, and the silkworms are sleeping and the beans are ripe, vendors on the streets and alleys carry baskets and flasks, shouting and selling Houhu cherries. The sound fills the city of Jiang, just like selling the lotus roots and lotus flowers of Mochou Lake and the large water chestnuts of Taiping Gate in the hot summer. However, they are not as pleasing to the ear as the delicate calls of selling white orchid flowers on both banks of the Qinhuai River, but their moving 思慕is no less 轻耳.</p>
<p>Those who enjoy eating cherries often abandon the market and go to the lake. This year, the cherries have suffered great damage in color and quality due to the wind and rain and the frequent urging of the谷雨. In the early days of the Double Fifth Festival, the people of the capital poured out of the city, and the vehicles and horses gathered outside Fenrun Gate, and the游人were everywhere on the wooden orchid boats. It is no longer necessary for the野人to送巳, and 玉谿's sigh is arising.</p>
<p>Our party of six reached the湖濱 by following the Taicheng Road in the morning. We hired a boat around Asia, which is the richest area for producing cherries. At that time, the lake water was just涨碧, and the reeds were肥. The water birds were 格格ing in between. The lotus leaves were as big as money, reflecting the morning sun like the芙蕖emerging from the water, which was enough to please the eye. Upon arrival, the leaves were scattered, the branches were low, the coral nets were all around, and the jade threads were垂垂. The wax包裹 and thousands of pills were灿烂, the鶯 含 and tens of thousands of grains were even. It would cost two silver coins to easily exchange for ten pounds of瑪瑙. Although treasures and Yingluo were all over the eyes, there was no金盘玉筯 around the chest. The goal was to add acid, and there was no need for甘蔗浆 to relieve the heat.</p>
<h3>Eastern Travel Correspondence (4) Wu Xiaohou</h3>
<p>(4) The situation upon arrival in Tokyo</p>
<p>Before arriving in Tokyo, the reporter originally planned to stay in a Japanese旅舍. Later, on the ship, he was instructed by Mr. Jiang Yan'en, a fellow passenger, that most of the 旅舍 in Tokyo are noisy and 不寗, and the expenses are very high. The Japan-China Association, located at No. 15 Sarugaku-cho, Kanda-ku, has been established as a Japanese財団法人 to receive international考察团 from China. The rooms are clean and the expenses are廉. Each large room with complete equipment can accommodate two people, including tea, water, and bath费用 for three yen per day. If it is only for one person, it costs two yen. There is also a Chinese restaurant nearby (i.e., a飯館). An ordinary Chinese meal for each person with two dishes and rice costs 25 Japanese cents, and a better one only costs 4角. Accommodation and food are convenient. Therefore, after arriving at Tokyo Station, I took a自働车 directly to the Japan-China Association to寄寓 (自働车 means automobile. In the Tokyo area, regardless of distance, each ride costs only one yen. There are no extra charges, and they travel all over the city. If there is no passenger乘之营业车, there is a 出赁一元 sign on the front windshield. A 手招 is just a request to address the instantaneous驰达, which is extremely convenient to乘用). Mr. Yamai Kakutaro, the executive director of the said会, showed me a letter of introduction from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country to Ambassador Wang Gongfu stationed in Japan. He was very enthusiastic in接待. The reporter chose to stay in a large street-facing room on the upper floor of the said会洗安置. As soon as I finished, Mr. Uchida Shikifu, the secretary of the said会 (Mr. Uchida is a graduate of the Shanghai Tongwen Academy and has stayed in China for six years and speaks Chinese very well), came to the room to ask about the purpose of this visit and the places I planned to visit. He helped me introduce them in advance and arranged a schedule of visits. Generally, the municipal social and educational organizations and all other institutions in Tokyo are closed on Sundays and Saturday afternoons. Therefore, the period from Monday to Saturday morning was set as the visit period, and Sundays were for游览风景名胜, so as not to抛废 useful time. On the afternoon of the day of arrival in Tokyo, I took the external letter of introduction to the Chinese Embassy in Japan to visit Ambassador Wang Fu. During the conversation, I learned that Wang was the grandson of Wang Laoshi, a professor in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu. Wang Laoshi was a famous scholar in Jiangnan, and he was over eighty years old. His essays and morality were unparalleled at the time. Wang's grandfather taught in Zhenjiang, and my late father, Mr. Peisheng, was the general manager of Zhencheng Yitong Government Silver Bank, living nearby and traveling back and forth very closely. At that time, I was still負笈in Shanghai and did not know much about Wang's grandfather. Now, after Wang mentioned it, I recalled the past as if it were yesterday. Because his grandfather and my late father had an old relationship, Mr. Wang was very kind to me and helped me a lot with my考察 in Dongkao. In addition to formally introducing me to Minister Adachi of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Japan (i.e., the Minister of Internal Affairs), he also asked the Vice Minister of Internal Affairs Chaoe no Kami to formally send letters to the governors of the six major cities and prefectures of Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe, as well as the mayors of each city, to give me preferential treatment. He also sent separate letters to the consuls general and consuls of our country stationed in each of these places to guide me in everything, so that I could fully考察 without any obstruction. I am deeply grateful to Ambassador Wang for his help in this trip.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Flourishing State of Financial Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>The discount rate is tired early, and the overdraft interest rate is tightened in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Market Overview: Recently, various goods such as silk cocoons, grains, and military supplies have required both silver dollars and foreign exchange, which has been very frequent. Therefore, the financial industry has added a lot of interest to its business situation, and the procedures have also become more busy than ever. The situation has suddenly revived, and although prices have been stagnant for a long time, they have also increased a lot of scenery. In addition, yesterday was the tenth day of the period, and the procedure for clearing and settling money houses was more than usual, so it happened to be the time when the atmosphere was colorful.

Therefore, they rely on the rotation of foreign rice. For example, yesterday, the financial industry cleared more than 2 million taels of rice funds on behalf of the rice merchants. It is heard that Chinese merchants cleared the funds to foreign countries indirectly through foreign banks. Therefore, the overdraft was very tight yesterday.</p>
<h3>Gold Bidding Rise Becomes More Fierce</h3>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Listing Suddenly Shrunk at Noon</h3>
<p>The internal market is also tight, and the transactions are very prosperous.</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Softens Again</h3>
<p>The cotton market is sluggish, with American cotton also slightly weakening. Sentiment in the local market has loosened. Recent rumors of Japanese merchants shorting the market have caused panic among retail investors, and the settlement of 1,100 bales by Hengda Company has further softened the market. However, long-term Hankou cotton is being held tightly. One factory recently released its October delivery, so the price fluctuation remains within two qian.</p>
<p>Forward cotton futures fell while distant months remained flat. Hankou standard cotton opened weaker in the near month, initially falling by one qian. Distant months Hankou cotton held up, managing to stay level. As a result, the near month fell by one qian while distant months remained steady. In the afternoon, the situation slightly weakened. A major player bought near months and sold distant months, causing each month to fall by another qian. Distant months remained unchanged. Total trading volume of Hankou standard cotton closed with the following gains and losses: 735,225 down 565,000; 535,000 down 208,610; 835,355; 539,000; 635,15; 107,560; 934,45; 19,800.</p>
<p>Spot cotton prices are just average and the unbaled cotton market atmosphere has softened again. The actual need is failing to continue progressing, which is naturally a major reason. The Reuters report that Liverpool plans to reship American cotton back to New York due to market weakness has also greatly contributed to renewed pessimism. Today, trading in the market is quiet. Only 150 bales of Yao cotton arrived, it is said.</p>

<p>Silk Market Calm Before New Silkworm Cocoons Hit Market</p>
<p>New silkworm cocoons from Zhejiang and Hangzhou will soon be on the market. Chinese silk merchants are currently busy collecting cocoons, but overseas silk sales are stagnant, and telegrams are not being forwarded. European merchants are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Yesterday, the silk market was completely suspended for the latter half of the day.</p>
<h3>New Cocoons Hit the Market in Zhejiang and Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Yu Hang, Zhejiang is the earliest area for silkworm farming. This year, farmers started raising silkworms early. However, after the third dormancy, the silkworms were affected by the weather, and their development was delayed. Early silkworms have already spun their cocoons, and late silkworms have also been put on frames. New cocoons have hit the market. Brokers opened scales yesterday and the day before. Not many goods arrived on the market. The initial price of cocoons was 55 yuan, which then rose to 57-58 yuan.</p>
<p>The Hebei Rice Market Amidst Flat Grain Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, over ten boats of Hebei rice arrived at Zhabei, with varying sales. High-quality Northern Japonica rice was in demand, while freshly arrived rice was also selling well. As for medium-grade and old rice, although the prices were reduced, there were no customers. The overall market remained stable. Thin rice experienced sluggish arrival and sales, and prices were stable. Yangshan rice was scarce and followed the price fluctuations of foreign rice. Vendors generally held their prices. White yuan rice was stagnant and there was little trading. Market prices were slightly weak. Overall, the new arrivals were being sold at a loss due to high costs. The old rice was either shipped to other ports or returned for resale.</p>
<p>Scarce arrivals and low stocks on the Huangpu River south of Shanghai. Local buyers are unsatisfied. Changshu-Wuxi Northern Japonica rice is mainly sold as ordinary rice, while the rest is sluggish. In this period of flat rice prices, stores are only buying Jiangsu and Tongzhou White Japonica rice if the price is discounted, which has invisibly weakened the market. Thin early rice from the South Road is not selling well, and buyers are stagnant. Although prices are flat, the situation is very stagnant. Yangshan rice and Dujian rice are extremely sluggish due to the arrival and brisk sales of foreign rice, which has greatly affected the market, making the situation even more bleak and turning into an unfavorable trend. The morning initially saw weakness, which then slightly improved because the price was lowered around noon. The situation for the day continued to show a stable and sluggish trend.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Firm Then Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market experienced a brief surge in the morning, with prices opening at 2 taels, 4 qian, 9 fen, and 7 li and a half. However, later in the day, prices fell because retail bulls gradually exited the market and the weather outlook for future harvests was favorable. By the afternoon opening, the price for the current month was still strong due to the bullish sentiment of major players, improving by 5 li compared to the morning closing. The weather conditions in the distant months are a major factor as market sentiment turned neutral. Judging by the results for the current month, certain manufacturers may not be willing to release their pre-drawn long positions, and there may be opportunities to push prices higher. As a result, the price for the current month was similar to Thursday's closing price. The prices for June, July, and August were down by a small 2 and a half li, and the prices for September and October were down by a small 5 li.</p>
<h3>7,000 Bags of Spot Wheat Opened for Sale</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the future price of wheat was stable as the price of foreign wheat improved by 1 or 2 jiao. However, the current bullish players are extremely confident because the spot wheat price has risen from 4 taels and 9 qian to 5 taels and 5 fen, an increase of 1 qian and a half in one week. However, there is less than a month until the new wheat harvest. If the weather remains favorable, the price will eventually soften. As a result, the prices for June to September were unchanged compared to Thursday's closing price. The quotations for spot wheat from production areas are rising. Major factories are eager to buy. The prices are improving. Prices for wheat from Xuzhou and Bengbu were 5 taels and 5 fen, wheat from Hankou was 4 taels and 1 qian and a half, wheat from Hunan was 2 taels and 2 qian 2 fen, wheat from Jiangxi was 4 taels and 7 qian, 4 taels and 6 qian, wheat from Shashi was 4 taels and 6 qian and a half, 4 taels and 5 qian, 4 taels and 4 qian and a half, 4 taels and 3 qian and a half, and 4 taels and 5 qian and 7 fen. A total of 7,000 bags were opened for sale and were purchased by Fuxin.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Dull Trading in Raw Sugar and White Sugar</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw reports of a Cuban spot sugar price of 1.50. New York sugar futures for May were at 1.39, and September was at 1.53, both down 2 points from the previous report. December was at 1.63, and March of next year was at 1.71, also down 1 point each. The Java spot sugar price remained at 9.50. June and July futures were both at 9.625, also down 125 from before. Although the association's raw sugar and white sugar prices were increased due to the rising exchange rate, the existing stock is relatively high. The export of finely ground white sugar is facing obstacles, which will inevitably have a major impact, further dampening buying interest. Yesterday, sellers were asking for 7 taels, but there were no buyers. Twenty-count medium sand white was at 6 taels and 9 qian, and the market was also weak. Ten-count Dutch was also at 5 taels and 7 qian, and there was little trading. Japanese sugar (N mark) was at 7 taels and 6 qian, ET mark was at 7 taels 5 qian 7 fen and a half, YT mark was at 7 taels 5 qian and a half, and YP mark was at 7 taels and 8 qian. Although there was some trading, the volume was very small.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: A Hankou cable reports that British merchants are selling 200 tons of tung oil at 23 taels and 6 qian per unit.</p>
<p>Over 900 pieces of yarn and cloth arrived from Japan.</p>
<p>Over 30,000 bags of Saigon rice arrived.</p>
